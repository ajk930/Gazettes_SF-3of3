GAMBIER, Ohio, Xov. 12.â Bound hand
â¢JJd foot, pagrged ar.d left unconscious on
the floor of his room in Boxley Hall last
night. James F. McGarvey. a student in
the Theological Seminary of Kenyon Col
lege, was the victim probably of the "un
known parties" mentioned by Coroner
Scarborough in his verdict as having tied
Stuart Pierson to a railroad track, where
a passing train crushed out his life. The
student body Is much aroused over the
assa-ult and is aiding Sheriff Clements
and the Mount Vernon police in investi
gating It. It is believed that McGarvey
gave information to the Coroner which
led him to render the verdict in the Pier
son case, as a note pinned to his cloth
ing by his assailants contained these
words:
â¢ "This will da for this time, but If we
come again It will be worse."
McGarvey was found helpless in his
room shortly before midnight on Satur
day by his roorr.ms.te, John Brooke, eon
of BishoD Brooke of Oklahoma. From
his clothes Jl 50 in coin had been taken
and a ?oid signet ring, valued at $S, had
been .Jerked from hi* anger.-" The" *trou j "
sers, which contained money, had not
been searched.
His mind befuddled since the assault,
McGarvey says that he was lying asleep
on a couch in his room last night and at
about 10:30 o'clock was partially awakened
when a towel waa thrust into his mouth
and another wrapped around his eyes. His
feet and hands were bound and then he
lost consciousness.
Sheriff Clement* and Policeman LÂ«wls
were called to Gambler from Mount Ver
oon when McGarvey was found and they
at once began an investigation, which up
to a late hour to-night had developed
nothing. The fact that the trousers,
which contained money, had not been
searched and the nature of the note leads
the authorities to believe that the men
responsible for Plerson's death committed
the assault In the hope of intimidating
him In the action yet to be taken In the
Pierson case.

Mitchell, candidate tor Register and
Recorder, was defeated last Tuesday by
the largest Democratic majority ever
piled up against a Republican candi
date in Beaver County. A little song,
entitled "Everybody Works but
Mother," did the trick and It practically
helped to defeat the entire Republican
county ticket.
Mitchell has been in office four years.
He sought to be re-elected, lie is re
ported to have filled the office with his
relatives until every one of his sons
and daughters and other near relatives
except his wife held county positions.
John Anderton, the Democratic candi
date opposing Mitchell, had made It the
burden of his campaign that Mitchell
employed his children in office, but not
until the eloga.ii "Everybody Works but

advance in his canvass. It is said that
the parody, besides defeating the whole

good or 111. the ancient Kingdom of Po
land has now become an Integral part
of the Russian Empire and that, while
the 6 Government Intends to fnlTy oh*
\u25a0erve the national rlsht* of Poland,
any attempt to wrest Polish autonomy
from the Emperor would he considered
an act of revolt and would lead thÂ«
Poles Into the sorrowful path* trodden
by them In IS3I and ISB3.
- The Russian authorities recognize the
Krayity of the movement In which two
antagonistic parties, the Nationalists
and. the Socialists, under the leadershfp
of \u25a0 such Poles as'Henrik Slenkiewicz.
the novelist, have joined, forces, and
they declare that none of the benefits
of . the emancipation can be conferred
on "a country In revolt."
The omcial communication Issued
this morning- recalls the fact that tho
imperial ukase of December. 2s last es
tablished a basis for the gradual reno
vation of the civil life of Russian sub
jects and points out that the measures
adopted in pursuance of that ukase
affected equally the Polish people. ! The
ukase says:
"In accordance with the ukase the
exceptional laws hindering the free de
velopment of the , nation were abro
gated and the Poles were given the
same richts as the Russians. Educa
tional.- municipal < and judicial reforms
were â¢ Introduced, as stipulated by the
decisions arrived at by the committed
of Ministers on June 18 and by the
ukase "Of " April 'SO. 1 regarding: religions
liberty..' The general measures adopted
by - the \u25a0 Government were extended, to
Poland, which also was given the right
of participation In the Douma and free
dom of meeting:. Finally, on October
30, the Poles . were recognized as free
citizens, thereby obtaining full oppor
tunity to prove â¢ their capacity. By
participating In a great creative work
they would consequently have gradu
ally attained. the ulterior progress of
the Polish nation, with the end of the
electoral Institutions, which naturally
would have sympathized;, with their
fate. \
"Forgetting the painful lessons of
the past the politician* who are direct*
Ins; the national movement In the
Klnsdom of Poland are making: at
tempts ;as dangerous for the Poltah
population as they are insolent toward
Russia to bring about the separation
of \u25a0 the empire. Rejecting- tikÂ« idea of
working In common with the Russian
people in the Douma. they are demand
ing In a series of revolutionary meet-
Ings the complete autonomy of Poland
with \u25a0a - special constitutional Diet,
thereby aiming at the restoration , of
the kingdom of Poland.
"Two political groups, one Socialist
and one . Nationalist, who are opposed
to each other, axe united In this aspira
tion, which Is upheld by many writers,
publicists and popular orators, who
carry- the people with them. ;
"In different districts of the Vis
tula there have been. numerous proces
sions, the participants In which carried
Polish flags and sang -revolutionary
songs. At the same time there has
been begun the arbitrary exclusion by
the Poles or the state language, even
In governmental Institutions, where its
employment Is provided for by law. la
certain localities bands. of workmen
and peasants are pillaging the schools,
the state spirit shops and communal
buildings. ' destroying all correspond

sentatives of the local authorities, in
defending order and public safety, have
been watering the earth for a year past
with their blood, by falling victims to
political crimes, and. the reasonable
part of Polish society is Impotent
against the growing pressure of.revo
lutionary organizations.
"The Government will not tolerate
attacks "on the Integrity of the empire,
insurrectionary plots or acts of vio
lence- It declares In a decisive man

Special Dispatch to The Call.
HONOLULU, Nov. 12.â Fully clothed,
with Fevered manacles about -his wrists,
clinging for dear life to the^spar buoy in-
Honolulu roadstead, exposed to peril .from
sea monsters and half-suffocated wlpi
brine, was the condition of 6. Meinell
when picked up. by a boating party qn
Sunday. . '. '. : '
The man was rescued arid taken, aehore, 1 *
only to.be landed in a police station cell.
He had put himself in. the perilous situa

British shiiv Brenda. ' . >'. r . .*
.When the' Brenda was some '" three .or
four miles at sea. a pleasure craft from
\u25a0the French ship. Ernest Reyer, found
\u25a0Meinell with lungs half .filled with*Â«alt
water, desperately hugging the spar. buoy.
The Frenchmen were returning from a
Sunday sail when they spied the British
sailor. They hove to and sisxed^im if hV
wanted to come ashpre'and, half, by signs,
for his lungs were so full of water that
he could hardly talk, and half by' words
he made them understand that he did.
So the. Frenchmen hauled him .aboard
and sailed Into the harbor, to their ship,
landing him on Sorenson wharf where a
captain of police. took him in. charge. and
led him to the police station, a 'willing
prisoner on land but not at sea. ' ,-'
He had been to the police station be
fore. His ship arrived. at Honolulu on
October 6, and almost .immediately he
tried to desert, but was' captured. by the
United States Marshal and taken before
United States Commissioner Mallng, who
sent him to the reef to appease the majes

to his captain on order : of the British au

his remarks made several dayÃ. ago about
the disastrous effect upon !the tali build
ings in New York of the combined, fire of
eighteen warships anchored in .the North
River have been misinterpreted as a crit
icism of the New York. defenses, y , â¢
"D.o you think the combined fleet of ves
sels, from -their anchorages In the North
River could destroy . the tall buildings in
New York?", was asked. >. .:
The Prince said he certainly did think
such a- result would, follow- a bombard

the' remark should \u25a0 have been misinter

\u25a0'\u25a0 "It is like asking If you- touched a
match to a haystack would it : burn ?"
said the Prince to-day. "Asa matter of
fact, there is no reason why \ any naval
force should seek to destroy buildings
which could easily be reconstructed. I
desire that this matter be put correctly,

ing- to conduct, the Government' seem
ingly' would rather l let Â» the country
drift '"lnto anarchy' than lift a- finger

thing 'but! patriotism,
having political ambitions and' being
convinced that' the' present ; Is only a
stop-gap Government until the Douma

their own future .by taking office in
a government hikr'ked for sacrifice, yet
Â»they appreciate,"^ as. does Count 'de

â¢â¢ -The danger of reaction Is hardly
worth serious conslderatio'n. '.however.
Even the discomfited advocates of the
old regime realize that the Emperor's
step is : irrevocable, that he could. not
â¢withdraw it if: he would.; and that any
attempt simply, to. place' him .in the
attitude of 'a usurper of the people's
liberties would precipitate an Immedi
ate crash in which he would 'be sure
to lose the throne.. Nevertheless the
Ifailure of the reform elements/to break
with- the Social Democrats and co
operate with Count deWitte may prove
disastrous and encourage the- extreme
agitators, which, would be apt to pro
voke a continuance of clashes and ex
cesses and in the end force the Gov
ernment to resort to extreme measures,
which, being, interpreted as a return to
the policy of repression, might precipi
tate risings.
Fortunately, something like, a realiza
tion of .these dangers is ; coming home to
a small but growing class of liberals. For
instance, Prince Eugene^. Troubetskoy.
who^declined to ; accept the portfolio of
Minister "of .Education*, because the party
with which Tie."ls affiliated is committed
to! a 'constituent asseihijly. In" an' open
letter to the public advises- the people
to support , the nqw, Government in its
efforts to restore tranquillity, aiid Dmitri
Shlpoff and M.GutcJ\koff, who also de
clined portfolios, 1 have {returned to Mos
cow with the/Intention of . organizing a
distinct party of mo'lerates to aid Count
delWittfc
The influential Slovo has become the
organ of "the party of order," and even
the i Russ, [while .Indorsing ..the action of
the Zemstvoists in refusing offices, thinks
that they â¢ could, with propriety, select a.
committee to act; in an advisory capacity
with the Government.
The ; spread of \u25a0 agrarian disorders \u25a0 in
Saratoff.is a new and threatening phase
of the situation, emphasizing the neces
sity of quieting the country. It Is signifi
cant, in connection' with the fear. of mu
!tiny among : the' troops, ' that the Council
for National Defense has taken occasion
td: issue a publte statement to the 1 effect

The .retirement of ; Count Lamsdorff,

continue in office till t then. He is fitted

the selection of another.
The \ new policy- of national education,

Dr. Washington Gladden Is
Claiming a Moral
COLUMBUS. O^ Nov. li.â Dr. Washing
ton Gladden, moderator of the Congrega
tional Church of the United States, an
nounced to-day from his pulpit that the
controversy over "tainted" money seemed
to have been settled, so far as the Congre
gational church was concerned. In an
address upon the work .of the Congrega-'
tional churches. Dr. Gladden said:
There Is no longer may diversity of opinion
actons us respecting the principles which
should guide us In our work. You are familiar
with the resolution which I offered at Seattle,
which was as follows:
"Rteolved, That the officers of the board
should not invite or solicit donations to its
funds from persons whose rains have been
made by methods reprehensible or socially In
jurious."
I am permitted to-Oay to make, respecting
this, the following statement:
The principal for which we contend was not
voted down- at Seattle; me board simply de
clined to take action upon It. lam now eatij
ned that the principle wti: oe respected In the
future action of the board.- There need be no
fear that moral issues will be raised hereafter
in the solicitation of money.
This statement. I am suit, will be gratifying
and r*asÂ«urtng to many. There is now every
reason why we should rally all our forces to re
gain the ground we have lost and to push the
work with new energy. I wish that ex-cry Con*
gregatiooal church in the country would make
next Sunday, or as soon as possible thereafter,
a cpecial thanks offering for the settlement of
the controversy and the removal of this hin
drance to us. . -.

College Man Goes to Sleep
in San Francisco to Wake
Up a Soldier jiri Hawaii
TAKEN TO PHILIPPINES
Has Rough Time Though
He Had Never Enlisted in
the Service of Uncle Sam
tl*clÂ«i DUi>x'2i '.o TbÂ« CaJL
NEW YORK, Nov. 12.â Sleep overcame
Frank J. Belyea in San Francisco. " He
awoke in Honolulu, a prisoner In the
guard house wearing the khaki fatigue
uniform of a private in the United States
army. He had not thÂ« least recollection of
having enlisted in his country's service.
Belyea lives in Green Point. Long Is
land. He admitted to-day that Belyea is
not hl-> right name. He is a graduate of
a well-known Eastern university and went
West soon after taking his in en
gineering. For a time he was employed
as a civil engineer. Then he tried his
hand as a cowboy and was a miner and
prospector with indifferent success.
December, ISOI, found him in San Fran
cisco. He was tempted to celebrate the
Christmas holidays. The temptation was
accentuated by the comfortable roll of
bills In his pocket. His last venture had
been a little prospecting speculation in
the mountains of California. Everybody
seemed to be his friend. He 'dimly re
members falling in at last with a squad
of merry-making soldiers, privates from
the Presidio. They took him to their
arms and told him he was their long lost
friend.
Belyea says all else was a blank to him
until he awoke in a bunk before which a
sentry was pacing. To his astonishment,
Belyea" was told he was in Camp Mc-
Kinley, Honolulu, and that his company
was en route to the Philippines. He pro
tested to Major Davis that he had never
enlisted and demanded his release, but
was bundled into the transport Thomas
for Manila.
Several times he raised a row about
having been shanghaied, but each time
was put in the guard house. One day he
escaped but was recaptured and im
prisoned as a deserter by Colonel Green
ough. On September 26 an order came
from General Chaffee to send him back
to the United States on the Sheridan. He
was imprisoned at the Presidio as a de
serter. On December 22 an order came
from Washington for his discharge, but
he was refused a year's pay as. it was
shown he had never enlisted.

short vacation.
"There are two cogent reasons for
not enacting such legislation next win
ter, according to Representative Bur

seven years. The $10,0*) judgment against
Winnie McMichael was obtained without
Mis. Dunham's testimony, she being

married to Dunham. The suit' has been
appealed.

before the verdict," said Mrs. Dunham
to-day. "I am truly .sorry 'for. my hus
band. He is under a spell, and I verily
believe he cannot help himself. In [my
presence he telephoned to the girl never
to come to his office or to his home again.
"I warned her and urged ' my husband
t<Â» have" nothing to 'do with her. Evejy
time he promised. Once in a burst of re
morseful confidence he told: me the whole
truth. But even after, that he went back.
"I have studied this case as only a
heartbroken wife could study such a case.
How did I learn the truth first? I had an
arrangement rigged up so that when she
called him I could cut in on the wire.
Time and again I listened to her talk to
him and heard him use endearing. terms.
I wish in my heart I could forget."
Mrs. Dunham told of finding a letter
from Winnie McMlchael in her husband's
pocket In IS9S, and of her going to the
girl's mother and warning her that her
daughter was golng-with a' married man.'
".Vow that I have a i $10,000 , judgment
against her. which I have no doubt will
be sustained, I intend to enforce it. When
she has lost the house and all the fine
presents my husband gave her she will go
back where she belongs and work as a

WASHINGTON. Nov. \u25a0: 1 2.â Attorney
General : Moody to-day made a state
ment with regard to the petition which
will be filed by his direction to-mor
row_in-the t Circuit Court of the United
States for the Eastern District of Wis
consin In a case brought- under the
Elkins law to test the legality of cer
tain commissions paid by railroads
(after the g receipt of . the published
rates) to a private car transit company
controlled-: by stockholders of the cor
poration shipping, freight in those cars
over the railroad lines. - *
This case arises out of facts which
have been investigated by, the Inter
state Commerce Commission" and also
bjr; private interests adversely affected.
It appears that-some of the principal
stockholders of the Pabst Brewing
Company organized and own the Mil
waukee Refrigerator Transit Company,
a corporation operating private * cars.
To the latter corporation the control of
the shipments of the Pabst . company
was given by an agreement entered
into between the two corporations. The
various railroads mentioned as defend
ants, while receiving as freight money
the open and published rates for the
transportation of commodities, have, it
is stated, paid to the transit company,
in whose private cars the Pabst Com
pany's-beer was transported, a com
mission of about 12 per cent upon the
amount of the freight money collected.
This petition is signed to test the
legality of such payments.
The case is regarded as of great
importance by the "Attorney General
and will be pressed to a speedy hearing.

AID PRISONER TO FLEE
Patrolman Woods Has Fierce
Struggle With the Wife
and Sister of the Man
OAKLAND. Nov. 12.â Suddenly re
penting after they had caused the ar
rest of their husband and brother to
night, the wife and sister of John Eng
lish, a lumber surveyor employed by
the Southern ratine Company, made
an attack on Policeman William
Woods, whom they had called to their
home at Iâ¬T^ Pacific street to take
English into custody, and the prisoner
succeeded In escaping. The struggle,
in which the two women engaged with
the offloÂ«-r, took place on the street in
front of the English home, and as soon
as the man whj had been placed un
der arrest made his escape from the
officer ho locked himself in the houso
and refused to allow Woods to enter.
The patrolman was fprced to break
down the door to recapture his prison
er, and it was only, after he- had
clublwd Engrlish into submission in a
desperate struggle that' he was able to
take his man to the lock-up. :
Craifd with liquor. English went to
his home to-night and, becoming en
raged over some trivial matter, threat
ened the lives of his wife and his sis
ter, M:t>s Agnes English. The latter
summoned Policeman "Woods, who
placed English under arrest. The
drink-cruted man resisted fiercely and
Woods was obliged to handle him in
anything but a gentle manner. He
finally dragged him from the house
and it waf then that his wtfe and sis
ter attacked the officer to enforce their
demand that he release the prisoner.
So savagtly did they assault the po
liceman that he was at last forced to
release English to defend himself from
the attacks of the two women, and the
man re-treated into the house and
locked tb*> door.
On the arrival of the prisoner at the
City Prison he looked as if he had
gone through a combined harvester,
and it was necessary to send him to
the Receiving Hospital to have his in
juries dressed. He was booked for
disturbance of the peace.

Discovery of Bottle of 3lor

OAKLAND. Nov. 12.âRose Cox,! who
says she is a trained nurse, was. ar
rested for begging last night: By .'P.
Hollowly at the corner .ofâ¢â¢"- East
Twelfth street and Twenty-third.-ave
nue, where he was accosted by the
woman. Holloway turned her over to
Policeman Gunther and she was booked
on a ehurr* of vagrancy.
On her arrival at the City Prison
the woman, who lives with her family
at the corner of Park avenue and Oak
street in Alameda. told a pitiful story
of being the sole support of an in
valid mother. She said that her fls
ter was aLso ill and that there was no
money in the house and that she had
been driven to beg. The police, after
an inquiry in Alameda. were inclfhed
to believe her story, but when the
woman was searched a bottle of mor
phine was found concealed on her per-
Eon, which leads the authorities to be
lieve that she is a slave to the drug
and was begging money with which to
purchase it.
TROIBLEÂ«OMB CHILD ARRESTED.
OAKLAND. Nov. 12. âWilliam Walter
Massie, IoK-ears old, whose uncle. John
C. Massie. surrendered him to the Su

corrigible, was arrested on Fifth street,
near Delaware, Berkeley, last night by
Policeman William Atchlson. It was
reported that the boy was wanted for
stealing from his uncle and Atchison
picked him up as a runaway and sent
him to the County Jail, -where a charge
of petty larceny was placed against
him.
John Ma6Ele, the uncle, secured con
trol of the youth a year ago after a
heated controversy. He asserted that
he had promised the child's father on
the. latter's deathbed that he would al
ways care for the youth. His desire to
abandon that task came as a surprise
last Thursday, when the elder Massie
petitioned the court to appoint another
guardian.

INDUCES HENS TO LAY IN
HIGH-PRICE SEASON.
Professor Jaffa Is
Successful in
Experiments.
In Adjusting Food
He Controls the x
Moulting.
BERKELEY, Nov. 12.â With visions of
housewives paying sixty cents a dozen for
"sttictly fresh eggs" at this particular
season of the year, all because Mistress
Hen is haughty and declines to lay as
per the hopes and ambitions of poultry
keepers. Professor Jaffa, the nutrition
expert at the State University, smiled
broadly' last night, as he announced with
satisfaction some of the results of exper
iments he is conducting,' which have as
their aim the use of scientific means to
induce the haughty hen to lay eggs ac
cording to programme, instead of ac
cording to her own sweet will.
Professor Jaffa returned last night from
an important conference with the Peta
luma Poultry Dealers' Association, at
which his experiments, now under way at
the university's experiment station at
Petaluma, and also at Professor Jaffa's
home in Berkeley, were thoroughly dis
cussed and plans made for their con
tinuance on a larcer scale.
These experiments have been conducted
with so little ostentation that few ex
cept thoj-e directly connected with the
work have known of their existence, or
their object. The experiments will not be
completed until the end. of December, but
they have progressed sufficiently far to
permit of the hope that Professor Jaffa,
and poultry dealers who have worked un
der his direction, have partially solved
the perplexing problem of how to Induce
whimsical hens to lay when they are in
unwilling mood. \u25a0 . â¢ .
MOULTS WHILE PRICE CLIMB*.
Hitherto the American hen, Independent
as are her American owners and disdain
ful of the despair her obduracy has cre
ated, always has decided to beÂ«in moult
ing along in the middle of the- summer,
has quit laying eggs at that time, has
continued the moulting process on into
September or October or November, the
while eggs climbed to a dizzy height In
the market quotations.
Up, up, up goes the price of eggs while
the queen of the barnyard thoughtfully
goes on her placid way, shedding feathers
and taking on a new dress, with abso
lutely no concern for the feelings of
boarding-house keepers who give up 50
or 60 cents for a dozen eggs, or for
the grief of the "ham and" man who
does business with many eggs, and whose
tariff cannot easily be adjusted to meet
the. high prices.
Professor Jaffa is a poultry expert, his
work in the field of nutrition problems
having been extended to include the pdul
try. question. He has a fine flock of Leg
horns ,at his home in North Berkeley.
The university "also : maintains, under his
care, a fl<?ck of white Leghorns and Black
Minorcas at Petaluma, For a long time
Professor Jaffa has considered the ways
of the hen. and especially her habits
which result in eggjr "going- to a terrific
figure every year during and after the
season when hens all over the country
decide to put on a new set of fall feath
ers, and also to stop laying.
REGULATING NATURE.
If this moulting business could be ad
justedâif nature's processes could be reg
ulated by scientific, r.ules, perhaps,
thought Professor â¢ Jaffa, the hens could
be induced- -to moult earlier, take, less
time to moult, and in consequence . begin
to lay eggs' earlier, .increasing the supply
so that poultry people could get more eggs
to sell when eggs ordinarily are high, and
the egg-eating public be spared the an
guish of paying ruinous prices for the
hen-house product
Professor Jaffa began experiments along
these lines three months ago. and their
results, although not complete, he be
lieves justify him in, hoping that event
ually the hen's moulting processes will
be rendered subject to intelligent human
control. Professor Jaffa said last night:
ThÂ« plan ueed to change the moulting habits
of thÂ« hen Is very simple. At a time early in
the summer, when the hens are laying regular
ly I have reduced their supply of nitrogenous
food, which class of food Includes meat, mid
dlings and similar stuff, about 50 per cent.
With the decreaeo of'food the egg laying stops,
inevitably. Then the hen whose attention is
diverted from laying eggs proceeds to occupy
herÂ«-lf with moulting. She gets through that
Job in a few weeks' time, we have found, and
quite, promptly starts in to lay eggs. Ordl
narilv the hens would start in to moult along
in Augruet and not get through till along in
November. We shortened the moulting season
to about a month by adopting the method I
have described, and found that the hens wer*
not impaired in vitality at all.

FIGHT CHARGE
I. W. Hellman Jr., Manager
; of Union Trust Company,
Says i Officers Are Wrong
Ttf APPEAR IN COURT
Capitalist; Declares He Did
\. Not "Violate the Speed
./ Law of City of Oakland
OAKLAND, Nov. 12.â 1. W. Hellman
| Jr., 'vice 'president of the Union Trust
Company, of San Francisco, of which
his' father ./is. president, for whose ar
rest :: a warrant has been secured by
the' Oakland police on a charge of vio
lation of ,the automobile speed law, has
announced his determination of-fight
in&Tthe charge in the Oakland Police
\u25a0 Court and to this end has secured the
services of Attorney E. Myron Wolfe,
the State Insurance Commissioner, who
will conduct his defense. EfforU.of
'the Oakland authorities, to serve the
warrant on Mr. Hellman have so far
been unsuccessful, but Attorney Wolfe
has informed the police that his client
will-appear for trial either to-morrow
or Tuesday, prepared to fight the case
to the bitter end. -
I Mr. Hellman's reason for fighting the
charge of speeding his automobile
within the limits of Oakland, according
to the statement of his attorney, is not
that, lie objects to paying the nominal
fine for the offense, but that he ques
tions the truth of the charge that he
violated the law. Attorney Wolfe says
that- Hellman is 'certain that . at the
time the officers declare that he was
speeding his machine on Twelfth street
he was traveling well within the speed
limit allowed by law.
The warrant for Hellman f s arrest was
issued with a number of others for
the arrest of prominent residents of
various cities about the bay, the com
plaints being sWorn to by Police Of
ficers McCready" and Murray, who last
Sunday stationed themselves on East
Twelfth street and timed all the auto
mobiles passing them in either direc
tion. The officers took the numbers of
those machines which they found to be
exceedingly the speed allowed by law
and among them was that of the ma
chine owned by Mr. Hellman.
Several of the autoists gave them
selves up as soon as they heard- that
warrants had been Issued for. their ar
rest and others were arrested in San
Francisco by an officer from th,is city.
In each case so far heard in the Po
lice Court a plea of -guilty has been
entered and the fine' paid. Mr. Hellman
Is the first" to announce that he will
fight" the charge and the result of the
trial is awaited with some interest,
both by members of the Oakland Police
Department and by automobilsts, as
this is the first, time the experiment of
timing the machln*s''4ia II 3 1 'been made
the basis ; of prosecution for r violation
of the speed law.
J7 A. Chase, another of the automo
bilisti," for whose arrest a^warrant was
Jssuetl at time as was that
for the arresfof Hellman, was ar
rested in San Jose this morning and his
case, together. with those of Samuel C.
Hammond anf Marshall C Harris,
were arrested in San Francisco yes
terday,, will' be heard in the Police
Court to-morrow morning.
Mr. Hellman is the son Qf I. W. Hell

\u25a0 \u25a0 - Â«~"~
fSO.OOO in Gold WaÂ» Cached In 1830 by
Za'chary TnylÂ®r'iÂ§ Men Near
Fort McKay.
Somewhere In the rugged bluffs of
the Mississippi River, near -the little
town of WauKon. lowa, eighty, miles,
north of Dubuaue, lies a buried treas
ure, consisting of $80,000 in gold. It
waS consigned to the - paymaster of
J'rairie dv Chien in IS3O for the purpose
Of paying the soldiers who were fight
ing Black Hawk and his warriors. Ihe
legend dates back to a very early period
in the history of the country and _1Â»
full of romances and incidents of the
days of the forefathers.
At the tinie the" treasury was hidden
Colonel Zachary Taylor was In com
mand of Fort McKay, then one of the
most important- government outposts
in this sectionof the country. It was
on the extreme '-buffer", region, be
tween' the Indians and the : whites. In
constant danger-- of attack by,.- Black
Hawk: and hls fierce warriors. To this
outpost one day in IS3O came four bags
of gold, each weighing about eighty
pounds, the aggregate value of which
was about $80,000. They were consigned
to the post 'paymaster- to pay oft the
soldiers It ' was the largest amount
that had ever been sent to a post so
far out on the frontier in a time of
practical hostility, and Colonel Taylor
was instructed most minutely as to the
care and guarding of the treasure.
' Just at that UniQ the Black Hawk
war was in progress, and very aggres
sive were the movements of the red
skins. There was serious possibility
that the little garrison might be forced
to evacuate* the fort and fall back. Ac
cordingly. Colonel Taylor decided that
the money should be hidden outside the
stockade, tie, called for "volunteers for
special service arid selected "four men,
headed. by a surgeon named Merclerie.
He gave- them each a sack of gold and
sent them at night to bury it. and
bring back a careful report, that oth
ers might be able to find it.
The same night there was. a deter
mined attaqk by -Indians on the little
outpost. The sentries were driven in
and some of them' killed. For days the
fighting, kept up. Meanwhile nothing
had been heard of the soldiers who had
been sent to hide the gold.
""As soon as the Indians had bÂ«en dis
persed and it was safe to reconnoiUr
the bodies of the four, dead soldiers
who had been sent to hide the gold
â¢were found at a considerable distance
from the fort. ' There w6s no trace of
the gold, and none was ever found. Two
days later a, soldier found a bit of
paper near where one of the bodies bad
been, giving a hastily scribbled ex
planqtion that the , gold had been
buried' in a certain bluff, but th* de
scription â waÂ» incomplete, and a care
ful search failed to locate the treas
ure. ~ No evidence was ever found tfthx
the. coin fell, into the"hand 3 of the In
dians, and it is believed that it is rest-
Ing yet in the original* hiding place.
â¢ Search' is carried on in a desultory way
every season, 1 and the gold will probr
ably some day be found. Thousands of
dollars have I been "spent in the search
by people living' in the, vicinity and by
fortune hunters.â Chicago Chronicle.

"History tells us that when coffee was
first brought to the cities of Western
Europe the first makers of it were Turks.
They roasted and ground the berries and
served the liquor as It Is served to this
day in the East, grits and all. We still
drink coffee as we drank It then, with
this difference, that we mostly omit the
grits and drink an Infusion instead of a
d*poct!on. It was not so with tea. No
Chinaman was importeu with t the first
pound of tea to teach us how to make,
and drink it. The consequence has been
that we have never drunk tea in tha
Chinese- wayâ that Js, as a simple in
fusion. . \u25a0 . . .''i, **
"At first there seems te> have been great
doubt as to how to deal with, the.flfcw
herb. It is even said that it was some
time? boiled, with salt and butter, and
served up as a sort of spinach* The old
phrase. *a dish of tea.' seems to bear out
thi3 legend. Finally tt came to bÂ« settled
that the. most wholesome and pleasant
way to treat the tea leaf was to make It
into a kind of sweet soup with sugar and
milk or cream. I have personal ' knowl
edge of no country In Europe b.ut ono
where tea Is used as in Chinaâ Portugal,
which got Us knowledge of tea making
from a province In China, with which, at
that time, no other nation of Europe was
in contact.
"It was while traveling: on horseback

tugal, away from the shops and loss,
where we had perforce to. make Â«zperS
ments In the moat economical use of tea
few ounces of tea and coffee that we
could afford to carry with us, that we hit
upon a discovery. Having: no milk wo
drank our tea, as most Portuguese drink
theirs, as a simple infusion, sweetened
with sugar.
"I remembered to hayÂ« read, I belisva
In the travels of the AbbÂ© Hue that whÂ«a
the Chinese desire to bÂ» thrifty In the UÂ«e
of the liner and more expensive tea* they
grind thÂ« leaf to powder and use- le*a tot
the infusion. We found that tea could b*
ground in a coffee mill as easily as coffae:
that tea made with the powder is as good
as or better than when made with ths
whole leaf, and that tha powder, as it
naturally would, goes further than tha
tea leaf."â London Times. '

PUBLICATION OFFICE THIRD AKD MARKET STRKETS. SAN FRANCISCO
MONDAY ; .NOVEMBER 13, 1905
LAST WEEK A BRILLIANT ONE.
LAST week's trade exhibit was brilliant as far as the important
staples of the country were concerned. The Government
issued its estimate of the corn crop, placing it at 2,707,993,000
bushels, or about 100,000,000 bushels more than expected some time
ago. It also issued an estimate of the cotton crop, which indicated
a larger yield than anticipated, and which immediately broke 1 the
cotton market. Complaints of scarcity of railroad cars increased,
both in number and vehemence, from all parts of the country. -
Conditions in Wall street were rather peculiar and contra
dictory. In the very face of an advance in call money to 10 to 15
per cent the stock market not only held its own, but actually ad
vanced. This was abnormal and gave rise to a good deal of con
jecture, which crystallized into the general opinion that the rise
in money was- artificial, not justified by current, conditions and
was the result of manipulation by the banks, which sought by ad
vancing the money rates to restrain speculation, which was showing
symptoms of becoming reckless. Conservatism is the governing
policy of the banks and great financial interests at present, and any
tendency toward overspeculation is met by prompt repressive
measures, which is a wise course. It is realized that stocks are
about as high as they can stand without a further large increase in
earnings, which, in view of the current abnormal activity in general
trade, is hardly to be expected; hence any further inflation of
stock values would probably either lead to decreased dividends, or
heavy liquidation, either of which would depress quotations and
cause more or less distrust in all quarters. Hence the advancement
of money to 15 per cent. Whether this theory is correct or not
remains to be seen.
Another theory was that the money magnates were discour
aging any Governmental assistance to the market and that -they
are quite willing to have the rates high until they are able to com
plete their purchases of stocks. It is conservatively estimated that
timid holders threw overboard more than 300,000 shares of stock
last week. The readiness with which these jettisoned holdings were
absorbed led close observers to rather anticipate another bull move
ment, later on.
The showing of general trade was most excellent. Seasonal
weather increased the demand for clothing and other necessaries of
life, and the demand for holiday goods showed signs of breaking
the record. The bank clearings suddenly shot up from aboufc 3 per
cent increase to 21. 1 per cent over the corresponding week of last
year, with Cincinnati and Louisville the only important cities failing
to show an increase. Gf the dozen leading cities New Orleans
showed the largest gain â 46.4 per cent â while San Francisco came
next with 36.8 per cent, and Minneapolis third with 33.7 per cent.
Pittsburg recorded 14.7 per cent, New York 20.6 per cent, and so
on. This exhibit of the bank clearings was the best for some
weeks. Supplementary thereto was the advance in Dun's ""index
number of the puce of commodities to $103,853, the highest point
of recent years. Hides rose to the highest point in forty years,
according to Dun's report, with an active market all over the
country. Cotton goods were reported becoming daily scarcer, with
an active inquiry, and many lines sold away ah^ad into next year.
The failures for the week were 183, against 213 last year. The
per capita of money in circulation also touched the new record of
$31.69. All these figures show that trade is not only holding its
own, but actually expanding, though it has heretofore been thought
that the limit of expansion had been reached and that the best to
be expected from now on would be the maintenance of current con
ditions. When this wonderful and persistent business expansion
will cease is a question as far from determination as ever. Like a
boy's rolling snowball it seems to grow with every step.
The dividend record is also making a most brilliant showing.
The New York Journal of Commerce says that the total industrial
dividends payable in November will exceed $15,000,000, an increase
of about $1.000,0001 .000,000 over the same month last year. This makes the
aggregate for the ten months of the current year $232,400,000, an
increase of about $18,000,000. No wonder that the â¢ blic have
been buymg stocks and that the banks have found it i c^ssary to
advance rates of interest to check over-purchasing, if it be true
that they have. v^
It is evident from all these exhibits that the prosperity has not
yet reached the end of its rope. But conditions will bear watching.
It is the commercial history of this country that hard times have
been immediately preceded by a remarkable activity in general
business;, so, without any desire to croak or throw cold water on
current trade conditions, it is as well, as the powerful financial
interests are now suggesting, to bear a watchful eye on financial
matters in order not to be caught napping should any sudden
reverse in conditions occur. It is well to remember the popular
French saying that it is the unexpected that happens.
AMERICAN SHIPPING.-
SENATOR HENRY CABOT LODGE has by his eloquence
been rousing the New England States to renewed efforts and
expectations for the passage of a bill by Congress that will
revive the fortunes of American shipping. He has expressed so
much confidence in the success of the pending measure that it seems
reasonable to suppose he knows the opposition to Federal aid which
has existed among some Western Republicans has been argued or
persuaded away. He has concluded that certain plans that have
been proposed to accomplish this aid to shipping are impracticable,
and he strongly advises other methods which will reach good results
without so much opposition.
As if to emphasize his speech by practical illustration, there
has recently sailed into Boston harbor the big steamship Missis
sippi, flying the American flag and bringing, an enormously valuable
cargo of hemp from the Philippine Islands. She is followed by her
sister ship, the Missouri, with a. burden of sugar and hemp worth
more than a million dollars. These two suggest the -immensity of
the commerce that might be fostered by American capital and car
ried in American bottoms. Tramp steamships, small and great, arid
flying other flags than ours, are now doing the bulk of this trans
portation, which would be done by American ships if the bill to
I favor our marine were passed.
According to Senator Lodge's plans, the aid to shipping by the
Government would not be an outright gift, but must be earned. He
thinks that subsidies cannot be given because of the prejudice in
this country against them"; and that the plan of assistance by dis
criminating duties is also impractical because to accomplish it would
. require the abrogation of thirty existing treaties. He mentions
favorably a proposition \.o give bounties to American vessels in
1 foreign trade and to pay the expense of which there would bean
increase in port and light charges; These charges in this* country,
he says, are extremely low, and he would raise them to a slight in
â¢ crease over what. they are in England ; thereby providing $2,000,000.
..\Anoiher proposition is to remit port charges on ships carrying
American naval reserve seamen. As thus planned bur annual 1 ex
'â¢ pendittire for aid would be $4,000,000; and this sum lie : says;/ we
could provide without a cent of new taxes on the American people.
He points out. that all the industries have been protected except
Â«. shipping, and he wishes to place American marine development on
an equal footing of competition with foreign Vessels, which; ate
amply subsidized and protected. by bounties. . 111111111

M IPROR OF DAM E FASHION
FOR ai separate wrap of dressy design this illustration will offer several
hints and suggestions to the clever, dressmaker. The coat iteelf is of
original cut. the back, laid in one piece to the waistline, and the full
ness of thejskirt deftly inserted beneath the strappings of lace that follow a
bolero form all around the body of the coat. The fronts T are one-pieced
likewise, the side lines "of the figure cleverly indicated, and the front fasten-
Ing following the extreme straight line that " fashion so strenuously Insists
upon in the later mode*. The sleeve is very full at the top, supported wltn
haircloth flounce tacked upon the lining,* so that they stand out In a square
rather than a drooping line from the shoulders. A pendant cuff of circular
cut makes a finish at the wrist. Cravette .strappings of the material are
crossed upon the bust, the velvet ribbon frilled edge making for a dainty
touch. ' \

Thy birth was high, thy fall was greatâ

Where Perm had dreamed that worth

The dastard schemer worked his will
To rob thy bank and tap thy till;
Corruption taught her shameful school,
While. voters whom she used as tool
Forever graced the j dunce's stool; ,
And c'en thine old and honored name
Was lisped as synonym of shame.

(Alfiiough.to''Bome It might appear

A stench befits the fairest nose,
That claws are on* a lambkin's toes;
That by supreme, celestial laws
(To which some give their votes' applause)
A knave must represent a cause;
And so their birthright they betray,
And barter for a sodden mess,
Which may not help, which cannot bless,
In Esau's old and simple way.
What then? They'll learn at last, no
g doubt,
That Evil does not Evil rout,
That Right must represent the Right,
That rainbows shine not in the night.
And when that day has come at last,
When black corruption's sway is past,
Then, echoing: back, shall ring this way
The greeting that we send to-day;
For Philadelphia, knavery-clear.

WHEN A MAN IS CROSS
A Splendid* Rule for Wives to Follow Is to Keep
j Mum Before Breakfast.
a~ WOMAN aSTts me to suggest some
/V plan to prevent well-meaning hus
*^Â» bands and wives from bickering
and .'Quarreling. She "confesses to being
unable to control the situation, so far as
she and her husband are concerned.
~"We love each other dearly, but never
theless we do get on" each other's nerves
and quarrel bitterly at time*. I can not
understand It. We start out each morn
ing with the very best Intentions, but be
fore we have sat down to brealefast we
have snapped each other up a dozen times
and said a hundred hateful things we
ought not " to have said. Is It nervous
ness, natural meanness, or what, that
goads us on? We have both prided our
selves on our good nature, but now we
are beginning to look upon ourselves as
fiends. Please suggest some rule to over
come this."
It so often happens that we human be
ings, while seeking methods of conquer
ing our difficulties, slight the very sim
plest, easiest" rules lying close at hand.
Perhaps the writer of the above letter
will not see much beauty in the sugges
tion" I shall give her for her benefit and
for the benefit of others â¢in the same
plight. I would say to her, However:
Don't laugh at this simple little rule,
commonplace' though It may seem, for
Jt.will bring the answer to your problem
and that is what you want. Well, then,
this is the remedy. Don't address your
husband, if you can avoid it, during that
nebulous period when he is disentangling
his wits from the land of dreams.
Neither should you permit him to at
tempt conversation with you during that
critical time.
To be more conciseâ keep mum before
breakfast. From what you . write It is
safe to assert that either one or both
of you belong to that class of persons
that find it exceedingly difficult, in the
morning, to adjust . themselves to the
waking world.
It is a fact familiar to us all that
upon waking from sleep many grown-ups.
REVIVAL OF AN OLD GRUDGE
LETTER from Mr. James .Hillary to
Mrs. Hillary:â
â¢'Syracuse, July 6, 1905.
"Dear Sallie:" I am dead tired to
night. Traveling is hard work; still
it has its compensations. You certain
ly get a lot of good things to eat at
these big hotels. I enclose the menu
for to-night's dinner. That soup with
the French name was simply out of
sight. The roasts and â¢ entrees and
salads were enough to stir up an ap
petite in a wooden Indian. How are
the kids? Love to all. Yours, JIM.

is the best ever."

Letter from Mr. Hillary to Mrs. Hil

part of the writer:
"July 15.
"Dear Sally: I am begining to get
mighty tired of this hotel, cooking.
(That is a lie, but I've got to say some
thing to jsquare myself- for that break
I made last", week.) Everything tastes
the sameâ just like sawdust. I thought
when I was eating a while ago that I'd
give a dollar for. one of your delicious
dinners. I am afraid I shall have to
give up traveling. My system, I feel
sure, will not stand tne messes a fellow
is compelled to eat in hotel's and res
taurants. I have indigestion already.
I ' am , afraid I shall never be
a well man again till I get back to
good home cooking. . The coffee they
serve here is vile. When I get to Bur
lington, next week, I think I shall try
to make arrangements to stop at your
cousin Belle's. I shall have to be there
for a week, perhaps longer, and decent
quiet may give me a chance to recup
erate. . Of course, I don't know any
thing of Bellts'a cooking, but as she is
your cousin there is a likelihood of her
.sharing the family talents. Anyway, I
have" business "with : Belle's husband.
He has an. important position with the
National Steam Power Company, and If
"I can only get him interested in my
plans I can put through a deal that
will net him and me a thousand dollars
apiece. However, I have to handle him
with care. He is one of the touchy
sort. Yours, JIM."

QUESTION OF IHHOBTALIIT.
Writing under the pseudonym "Peter
Rabbit" in Harper's Magazine for No
vember, a well-known naturalist discusses
the . question of Immortality as . viewed
from!- the standpoint of the rabbit, who
is supposed to' be writing the article :
: "Among all your hopes there Is none
that : for an Instant /compares In value
with 'your persistent \ hope In a personal
Immortality.;-? Because of its very great
ness I it . has aroused the most doubt and
questioning.* Indeed, that It Is too good
to be true Is perhaps the only argument
against it: and . the rabbit dismisses this
cheerfully: with r the /.reflection that the
same was said by your ancestors of every
great and good thing that you now enjoy.
\u25a0* "Of late, however,: men are everywhere
asking the * old question lof immortality
over again. V There have been many tribes

as well as children, are- cross. nervous,
fussy and wretchedly unsociable. The
secret of thfci Is; that 'these unfortu
nates experience keen difflcultyâ almost
painâ in gaining control of the voluntary
mind.
The Involuntary mind-the mind that con
trols one during sleepâ is only partially
under the command of the will -at thl3
time. The result is that thÂ© half-wak
ened one is sensible of great inharmony;
is distressed. Irritable, not himself.
It sometimes takes such a one an hour.
or even two hours, to gain complete con
trol of his voluntary mind. Not until ha
does achieve this is he fully himself.
For this reason It Is not only foolish.
but very unwise, foe any one to attach
importance to his moods or his words
before this time. It is unkind and a
waste of time to "answer back" or re
prove him when he gives utterance to
hateful remarks. He should be let alorm
until he reaches that adjustment where
be is really accountable for what he says.
The same rule that applies to a hungry
husband applies *o one not fully awake.
Don't attempt to entertain him: don't
talk to him; let him alone* until he la hlra-
Not only should wives .employ forbear
ance with husbands, but husbands should
be equally considerate of wives in this
matter.
Indeed it would be well if every num
ber of a family recognized this principle
in' dealing with one another. It Is safe
to assert that. If this rule was universally
observed, a vast amount of friction and
inhannony in households would be en
tirely done away with and the divorce
lawyers given a long vacation.
Perhaps that Dcs Molnes woman, Mrs.
Rosalie Pohlman. who had to divorce her
husband because he was such a "grouch"
and because he refused to laugh at her
jokes, made the error of springing thxme

what kind of table she does set, any

Mr. Hillary to Mr3.-' Hillary, with
more unwritten reflections:

and wouldn't to any body "out you. but the
fact is I fare worse here that at hotels.
Belle certainly does run her house on
cheeseparing principles.' I have gone

been here. She buys meats and vege

confounded yarn that is) and then
serves them either undecdone or burned

Mrs. Hillary to her cousin Belle:
"NEW YORK. July 28.

to write this way to 'you. I am sorry
that the old errudgre* you bore against

at your house why "didn't you say so?
Since you invited him to- visit you, why
do you insult him? I have hla word
for it that that is what you do. He
says he goes to bed hungry every
night. He says you buy tainted meats
and vegetables and then only half cook
them or else burn them to a cinder. I
am so indignant at such treatment that
I simply cannot contain myself. I
could have stood any kind of affront of
fered to me personally and never have
said a word, but to my husband â never.
OX course. I don't expect you to so to
a lot of extra. trouble and expense on
his account, but you might at least give^
him something fit- to eat. Your cousin.

Mr. Hillary to Mrs. Hillary:
"BURLINGTON, Augr. 1.
"Sallie: Good Lord, Sallie, what do
you mean by writing Belle such a blast
as you sent her last week? You've
played the devil with all my plans now.
"Her husband is so* mad he won't

several hundred dollars than when 1

To whom it may concern: This is to certify

Having bc*n elected to this dignified and
mucn-Â«Hignt after position by the large ma
jority of 15C0 (more or less), it U with a
feeling of chestinees that I assume the right to
stand- as the man behind the gun; and X wish
It well understood that when any member of
the club be shot with said gun they are not
to fall down, but to stand up and_spout^either
what they can or they 'can't. " \u25a0* . .
During the past campaign wh!l* running for
office I promised every one, not : a soft Job
on the : board of directors, or in the treas
urer's office, or as corresponding secretary,
etc. . but a "square deal", to: all. This means
that my office on member day-is open to, labor
er capitalist and spectator alike, and It should
not be up to any one person to be the whole
show. In conclusion, I 'wish to repeat to you
what I have never said to you before. "He
who lives without folly is not so wise as he
thinks." \u25a0

, Alton's totally- DEAF ear for - the space ot
; only ONE MOMENT, when' her hearing was
â¢ '-, "Instantly" restored, and she 1 clearly heard
sentences WHISPERED at 20 feet by me
and others. 'I â¢ witnessed a similar \u25a0 case a
week', ago. .ANOTHER such handkerchief
was taken many miles, laid on Judge B.s
wife, instantly removing the pains of. nearly
FATAL APPENDICITIS, and she recovered.
My friend, a leading city broker, after : his
flEger-was "touched," laid It on his totally
: DEAF ear. and instantly heard a WHISPER. -
' Rexradio touched MY finger, and hours later,
at the. other end of the city. I laid It on a
friend, whose PAINS instantly subsided. He
simply "touched" the CHAIR flf a RHEU-
. MATIC patient : and : his \u0084 pvwer passed
t-h-r-o-u-g-h the chair Into the patient and
\u25a0 instantly: removed : all pains. Another time
'he "caused his power to pass 1 through the
FLOOR several feet to a' SPINAL sufferer,
( whose pains promptly s disappeared. I SAW
him THROW his power through the AIR 20
feet to a totally DEAF ear, -arid the ear
Immediately heard a. WHISPER at 20 feet.
My friend, a well-known millionaire, rin 3
Eeconds heard distant WHISPERING with
his 30 years' totally DEAF ear. The famous
MIDGET. Mrs. General TOM THUMB' 3
deafness was similarly instantly cured. I
saw a DEAF MUTE In 8 seconds made to
HEAR and SPEAK. Truly Rexradio is ab-

AMERICA'S STEEL
RAIL INDUSTRY
Its Kise and Progress and
Success; in Competition
With the Foreign Product
EXPORT TRADE GROWING
United States Consul at
Mannheim, Germany, Sub
mits Interesting Statistics
"The United States produces more rails
than Germany and England combined.
The American steel rail Industry can. In
view -of; the; facts, look back with satis
faction on the j forty - years \u25a0of its ! devel
opment. American' steel' rail manufacture
Is ' to-day so { powerful | that, "except for
some extraordinary circumstances, It T is
able to. supply the demand" of the country,
and to furnish in -addition a fair 'amount
of ; export. . The present capacity of steel
rail manufacture in the United . States
i 3 estimated at from' 3,250,000 to 3,500,000
tons..; The fact that the -United States
has become , an export country, for rails
will probably become : more apparent,
year by year, in the future."/ ; :
"'So; says H. W. Harris. United States
Consul lat Mannheim, Germany, in a : re
port J. to ; the \u25a0 Bureau of Manufactures,' De
.partment of ; Commerce - and Labor. And
Mr." Â» Harris lduotes' statistics; and tables
and other, technical data to prove that he
knows .what he ' is : talking about. Con
tinuing, ; he says : '
"The vast concentration in the manu
facture of American ~ steel rails has'ren
dered the; United : States able to enter
into the sharpest competition with, En
gland â¢ and < Germany- in \u25a0 the export of rails.
Prior, to 1890 .the ; export of rails from the
United -States never/^mounted -to more
than - 8000 tons iln any one year ; â-â¢ In 4 fact,
the .country' had large Imports of rails.
For example, *\u0084 in \u25a0' 1881 the imports were
296,000 1 tons, in 1882 \ 118,000 tons, in 1887
77,000 tons, in 1888:137,000 tons. ", With the
year 1890 the United States began gradu
ally to become a \u25a0;â¢ factor , in ; the export
of rails. These exports were: In 1890,
10,000 tons; 1895, 12,000 ".tons; 1900, 348,000
tons; 1904, 161,000 tons.
"The record in the , export : of rails dur
ing the last ten years was made by Eng
land in 1903 with 604,000, by Germany in
1903 with" 379,000 tons and by the United
States In 1901 with 375.000.; tons. "It will
be seen how \u25a0 the United j States,, which in
the eighties Imported at times 100,000 tons
and more , of ] rails per year, has now be
come an Important factor in ' the export
trade. This has been due in part to the
low ' price made - by Americans for rails
as well as to \ concentration, the low price
being in fact the result -of competition.
"From 1875 on the duty on rails was
fixed at $28 per ton and was by further
reduction - made, respectively, $17, $13 50
and, in 1894, $7 75 per ton, the latter. being
since that date unchanged. This con
tinuous protective policy has helped the
American rail Industry onto Its feet and
finally has rendered It able to manufac
ture rails much cheaper than â¢ the Eng
lish,'who were formerly the rail makers
of the world. . _-' â¢." *
"In the year 1876 the protective tariff
on rails was $28 per, ton, or 50 per cent
ad valorem. In the years 1901-3 American
rails cost $28 . per ton, that is, the same
amount as the . duty had been twenty
four years before; the duty; in -the years
named being 28 per cent, ad valorem.
From the year 1894 to 1898 American rails
were cheaper f.o.b.j factory in Pennsyl
vania - than the English ' product f . . o. â¢b.
at -the English coast. At present -the
prices are" about the same., The difference
has since the year JSOO amounted to from
$1 to $l'6O per ton."â Washington Star.
PETRIE SHOWS GREAT SKILL.
Captain of the ; Albion RoTerg a Star
: Â»\u25a0._ In Oakland Game. :/_\u25a0['\u25a0 A'-
OAKLAND, Nov. 12â Perhaps never
since the days of the Illustrious Duffy
ha 3 a finer exhibition of "dribbling the
ball": been given than that; of Captain
Petrie' of the ; Albion -Rovers this aft
ernoon at: Freeman. Park. Had Petrie
been playing billiards they would have
said 1 he was nursing Jthe ball. He
played with his foot^ with .as much
skill -as the average billiard player
does, with his cue: . It was due to Pe
trle's remarkable skill that the Albion
Rovers beat the i Sacramento team at
association football by a score of 4
tO 1. \u25a0 y . i
In the first half Sacramento scored
one, but It was due to an error â one
of those black " marks that are not reg
istered in association football as they
are in the national; game. Sacramento
made a goal within five minutes, but
it did not make .another throughout
the game. f ; BoB* : ; Shand saved his team
from the start, but an infringement- ot'
the 'rules by one of the 'Albion j Rovers
gave Sacramento a _ chance to â kick
again and McCartney scored. The pen
alty was: when Mathieson tripped
Turner Inside the lines. ;:,
Petrie scored. both goals for the Al
bion Rovers In the first half. As in
side right he secured the ball and
drove ; the goal, : although he was not
given, a chance 'to display his wonder
ful "dribbling" powers as Tie was .in
the> second. At the- end of the first
half the : score stood 2 to 1. ! ii-
Soon after the- beginning of the sec
ond, half 'Petrie,- got; the ' ball and
"dribbled" it almost to the goal. Then
he ;! tried , and missed the ; goal. Why te
was tripped, by ; McCaliun of his own
team \u25a0 and Yscrlmmage at the . goal
gave the /Alblons "a corner kick. *: The
ball was '.kicked back and forth; and it
looked -bad -for. .the > Albionsi. . when
Shand at .the^: goal prevented Sacra
mento, from scorinc .
; . There -were . several i amusing ' inci
dents,* one of 'them .being, the Collision
between Kennedy/ and Gilchrest.-'when
the latter was thrown sprawling :â¢ by
hisfown right full. : Then Petrie} began
his ; remarkable .'.'dribbling," which was
the 'feature of the game, but 1 every
time he got near the goal, after throw-,
ing " his -: opponents 1 right -and lef t / arid
never .'allowing jthe ball "to; leave his
toe, ! ~a I mischance t * prevented : a goal.
TwicÂ«, however,' "Ainsworth managed
to " land : a"â¢ f ree ".' kick ; and *,Thorpe :" was

ef hitting. Three-baggers and doubles,
helped along by a bunch of singles in

WTIALEN'S GEEYHOUNDS
CAPTURE TWO EVENTS
Freeport- Takes Champion
Stake While Fair Flying
:â¢ Accounts for Reserve.
- G: Whalen won the Champion and the
Reserve stakes at Inglesida' yesterday
with Fteeport and Fair Flying, respect
ively. The former greyhound was in
great form and gained his victories in a
decisive .manner. Fair Flying had the
best of luck in not having severe trials,
which left her fresh at the end of the
day's running. Miss Gambit, which was
running well, would have: met her in the
final and would undoubtedly have given
Fair Flying a hard race, but her owner
was forced to withdraw, her, owing to a
severe race in the previous round. In the
postponed open event E. ; Preston's Lady
Leeds, Miss Brummel. and .Queen's Beau
ty ran in the order namedl '; -
For. the first time |In several weeks the
card was finished before 1 darkness set in.
In the postponed Champion . event - Lady
Kelp led and beat P. ReiÂ»y*s Tralee Maid.
The latter ran a miserable 'course, as, she
figured to win on account of having easy
running. The talent went up against it
hard in this trial. Vina beat Edenvale in
the postponed Reserve event. The follow
ing are the results, with Judge John Sut

SEASON STARTS
AUSPICIOUSLY
Sport at Oakland Will Be
of Highest Class During
the -Week Now Opening
DB. LEGGO COMING WEST
Great Soii^of rPuryear D Will
Be Wa^nly Greeted by
Baeegoers When He Stalls
The opening of ; the racing season at
Oakland on Saturday 'was pronounced a
marked success and there appears to be
no ; complaint from \u25a0 any quarter. The
bookmakers, and ; there were twenty of
\u25a0 ! them In the ring, could handle all they
' cared to reach out for. This is almost
without parallel, for, when that number
of bookies can make the weight, without
one little drop-kick being registered, the
game must have been all right.
While. the defeat of Proper in the handi
cap came, as a body punch to the big
speculators, the ring was probably'heav
iest loser over the Jennings horse's down
fall.. Both San Nicholas and High Chan
cellor were played across the board at
healthy odds, the layers catching it three
/ ways from the Jack. ' â¢ ,\u25a0'.-.
Secretary. Treat- received a wire yester
day, from Latonia, stating that Dr. Leggo
and the balance of pie McCafferty horses
would leave for Oakland last night. The
Doctor will be a" great" card when .: he
starts at the track across the bay.
Tommy Griffin with his halter and hi*
horses will not be out here until after
the close of the Aaueduct meeting.
Among the features of the .week will
be the JlOOO Kingston handicap to be
decided on -Wednesday. Saturday next
the $1000 Hamburg handicap at one and
a sixteenth miles is to be run. On the
same day the Sain handicap valued at SSW
for ; two-year-olds jis also . down for de

and the first period endedâ Hornets 1 goal.

the Vampires hard, but the back line and
goalkeeper succeeded tn defending against
all attacks. A penalty kick was awarded

MATCHES ABE EXCITING
Janes and Adams Play Bril
liantly at Times, but as
a Bule They Are Wild
m Some good tennis matches were played
en the court of the CTaremont Country
Club yesterday in the first annual scratch
doubles tournament. The Baker brothers
and Herbert Schmidt and Harry Rolfo
were the successful .teams. They will
meet m the final match on Thanksgiving
day.
The best. match of the day and also of
the tournament was played In the morn
ing. The contestants were the Baker
brothers and Melville Long and Clarencs
Griffin. The Bakers won tn straight sets,
but the match was nevertheless dose and
hard fought. The winners played a moro
aggressive game than usual and <B4 some
excellent lobbing.
Grifto and Lcng came within a point of
winning the first set when they led -at
5-4 and Â«-Â». The Baker brothers polled
themselves together and ran out thÂ»
set. >-Â«.
Although the score of the second set
was not close, the games were long- and
well - contested. Long and GrifÃn played
fast tennis an-1 hit the bails much harder
than their opponents. The -latter, as
usual, were steady and their errors few
and far between. , â¢ W â¢_
The first of the afternoA ' matches
proved another, good one. The Bakers
were opposed to George Janes and FrÂ«d
Adams, respectively coast and State
champion. As in the morclnr contest,
the Bakvrs . hit the balt3 ; harder than
usual and lobbed high sod deep. Beth
Janes and Adams played brilliantly at
tines, but a* a rale were wild. Adams
handled lobs poorly and smashed out of
court repeatedly. Janes. walJe not at nfcÂ»
best, was far ahead of Adams and did
some good smashing and driving. The
Baker brothers won thÂ« first set handily,
after getting a bad start. In the second
set Adams and Janes forced the play and
did sonsa terrifnc driving, and smashing.
The -Bakers were outplayed tn this set
and won only three games. Although,
Adams and Janes failed to win a game to
the last set. it was fairly close. Many oÂ£
the games wer* long ones, bat the steadi
ness of the Bakers carried them through.
The score was 6-2. S4 f S-O.
Neil Baker played better tennis yester
day than ever before and showed great
improvement in his volleying and over
bead work.
The lasi match of the day was between
Herbert Schmidt and Harry Rolf* and
Frank Mitchell and Grant Smith. ThÂ«
former won br a score of 7-5. *-L
In the first set Smith and Mitchell lad
all the way; but near the close Mitchell
fell down on his service same*. First
he lost a *M> game on service and fol
lowed It aj> with the iosa of a Â¥hÂ» game.
The losers led at Â»-4. bat Roife and
Schmidt took the next threÂ« games and
The second set was a one-sided affair.
Smith and Mitchell won the first game,
but secured no more, senmidt and Ralfo
dropped the balls short on Mitchell as ho
followed in his service and won many
points. The -latter fell down In his* vol
leying and did some good driving and
smashing. ..
The light in the afternoon was uncer
tain, as the court runs from east tojwest
instead of from north to south. Trees on
the west side added to the uncertainty of
the light.

hood Without Finding Clew
Miss Ada Jackson, a telephone girl,
living- at 44 Prosper street, and Mar
tin Shunbridgre. a blacksmith, living- at
215 Dorland street, assert ' that they
were the victims of a bold, masked
highwayman on' Saturday night.
A fern' minutes before 11 ooclock a
citizen told Policeman F. H. Doherty
that he had heard the screams of a
woman as he was passing the Mission
High School at Eighteenth and Dolores
streets. Doherty ran to the school and
saw Miss Jackson and Shunbridge com
ing from the rear. They informed
Doherty that they had been sitting on
the school steps, chatting, when a man
with a red handkerchief concealing his
features suddenly confronted them.
Miss Jackson said she screamed and
the footpad gruffly told her to stop her
nolÃe.or he. would put a bullet through
her bead. He had a revolver in his
hand. He made them hold up. their
hands and quickly took from- Miss
Jackson's fingers three rings, one a
plain gold ring, another with a small
diamond and the third with a turquoise.
He also took a small gold pin from her
neck. He relieved Shunbridge of his
gold watch and chain and a dollar. The
watch and chain were valued at $40.
The couple said the robbery only took
about a minute and the footpad disap
peared in the direction of Dolores and
Eighteenth .streets.
Dobert j* made a eearch of the neigh
borhood, but could find no trace of the
footpad.

Cure Forjhe Blues
ONE MEDICINE THAT HAS NEVER FAILED
Health Folly Restored and the Joy ef
Ufe Regained
When a cheerful, brajre, light-hearted
woman is suddenly plunged into that
perfection of misery, the BLUES, it is
a sad picture. It is usually this way :
She has been feeling " out of sorts *'
for some time ; head has ached and
back also ; has slept poorly, been quite
nervous, and nearly fainted once or
twice ; head dizzy, and heart-beats xery
fast; then that bearing-down feelintr,
and during her menstrual period she is
exceedingly despondent. Nothing
pleases her. Her doctor saya : ** Cheer
up: you have dyspepsia; you will be
all right soon."
But she doesn't get " all right," and
hope vanishes; then come the brood-
ing, morbid, melancholy, everlasting
BLCES.
Don't wait until your sufferings have
driven you to despair, with your nerves
all shattered and your courage gone,
but take Lydia E. Pinkham's Vege-.
table Compound. See what it did for
Mrs. Rosa Adams, of 819 12th Street,
Louisville, Ky., niece of the late Gen-
eral Roger Hanson, C.S. A. She writes:
Dear MrÂ». Pinlcham:â .
'" I cannot tell you with pen and ink what
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound
has done for me. I suffered with female
troubles, extreme lassitude, ' the blues,'
nervousness and that all-pone feeling. I was
advised to try Lydia E. Pinkbam's Vegetable
Compound, and it not only cured my female
derangement, but it has restored me to perfect
health and strength. The buoyancy of my
younger days has returned, and I do not suf-
fer any longer with despondency, as I did be-
fore. I consider Lydia E. Pinkham's Vege-
table Compound a boon to sick and suffering
women."
If you have some derangement of
the female organism write Mrs.
Pinkham, Lynn, Mass., for advice.

WILLIAM HADLEY, AN AGED NIGHT CLERK,
ENTICED TO ROOM AND ROBBED.
BOLD GRIME AT \u25a0 DENVER HOUSI
Victim Gagged and
Left Tied to
Bedstead
Frees Himself and
Gives Alarm^to
Day Man
Struggling in vain against two robbers
in the darkness early yesterday morning,
William Hadley, the aged night clerk of
the Denver House, 217 Third street, was
overpowered, a gag thrust into his mouth,
his hands lied behind his back and his
body lashed to the bedstead in an inner
room of the hotel. The robbers went
through the 'pockets of the clerk and
took from him the $18 they found there and
a bunch of keys. Then they left him
helpless and ran to the street below.
Hadley, although nearly choked by the
rude gag that had torn his cheeks and
bruised his tongue, fought with the knots
that fastened him to the bed and in half
an hour he somehow managed to tear
himself loose. Half dead, he staggered
to the door of the day clerk, Ernest Ah
rens, and managed to make known his
predicament. Ahrens cut off the gag and
loosened the old man's hands. Brokenly,
Hadley told the story. Policemen came
In,- but the robbers had made good their
escape. .They. left no clew.
Hadley has been the night clerk at the
Denver House for years. He is 65 years
old, though by no means a weak roan.
About nine o'clock Saturday night a
neatly dressed man entered the office on
the second floor and asked for a \u25a0 room.
He gave his name as Myers. - Hadley
took him to room 234, on the third floor.
The man said thdt he was going out for
a while, but that he would be back soon.
Evidently the plan was for the one rob
ber to go outside and get the other. How
they got back Into the house Hadley
does not know, but about* 3 o'clock In the
morning he was surprised to see the man
who had rented the room coming down
the hallway. The man declared . that
some one was In his room and asked Had
ley to come and investigate. Never sus
pecting a plot, Hadley went to the room.
It was dark and he reached up to turn
on the electric light. At that instant both
men seized him by the arms. Hadley re
sisted with all his strength, but a threat
ening revolver and a knife caused him
to desist. A gag, made of a piece of
broom handle, was placed in his mouth,
his hands were bound behind him and he
was fastened to the foot of the bed. The
robbers went 'through his clothes and
took what, money they found. The office
was locked and they made.no attempt
to break through the 'door. As Hadley
stumbled down the stairs after he had
freed himself, a small boy named Howard
Tupper. 1153 Harrison street, who was
delivering papers, saw him and ran for
the police.
Hadley says that one of the men was
about five feet four Inches in height, had
a brown mustache and wore a gray coat
with black trousers. The other was
about five feet nine inches tall, wore a
dark suit and had a black mustache. He
concealed his features with a mask. The
police are working on the case.

Milton Andrews' Companion
Not the Daughter of How
ard, Australian Fugitive
Police' records dissipate the identi
fication of Nulda Petrio," who was killed
by' Milton Franklin 'Andrews, as . the
daughter of Augustus "Howard, the
Australian turfman and alleged leader
of the gang that swindled \Villard S.
Green, a. Denver mining operator, out
of $60, 000, in this city six. years ago.
Augustus Howard, who- was in real
ity Charles- Doyle, a fugitive , from the
Antipodes, lived in princely style, with
his wife and two children, at 1023 Pint
street in 1898 and 1899. when, it was
charged, he operated " his acetylene gas
and other swindles', that won for him
5200,000. Howard's children: were two
girls â one about nine^ \u25a0years of age, the
other not three years- old lat 'that time.
The records. are conclusive, and; are ab
solutely confirmed.: by- men'- who, were
in close touch with the Howards while
he was under police, inquiry. .,, By. no
process of, figuring 'could .; Howard's
elder daughter 'have', reached i mature
womanhood in : 1905. v\ If be * alive
the Howard . child 'is } now not more
than. 16 years old. > NuldaPetrie, was a
fully developed woman 'of ' 24 years of
age at least and 'looked to; be 26 or 30.
With the Howards -for a short, time
was Miss Bessie Lee.'said to be Mrs.
Howard's â¢'â¢ sister. Mis's :_ Lee % was a
demi-brunette, , medium;/ height \u25a0and
quite plump. "'She Iwas about j25 years
eld and. could, not, now be confounded
with Nulda Petrie^: - Mrs. Howard was
tall, very dark "and - trimly *" 'slender,
about 32 sears .fold:-'" She ''also 'could :

Police Learn That After
Being Shot McLaughlin
Made H Significant Remark
The police; in 'pursuing ; their'inves
tigations into the 'murder, of Patrick
McLaughlin in his saloon at Beale and
Bryant streets last Wednesday night,
are. tinding that* James Morrissey, the
suspect, has made many erroneous
statements, which'- lead, them' to believe
that he is the right man.
' George Cramer, the cook in, the sa
loon, called at the City Prison yester
day morning, and, after looking at Mor
rissey,- said; he, had seen him' in the
saloon several times: at the free lunch
counter. This contradicts, Morrissey's
statement to Captain, Burhet that he
had neverjbeen in' the saloon. Vl ' -' \u25a0
To strengthen. the belief that the mo
tive for the "crime robbery, Cramer
said' yesterday 'that', when McLaughlin
was shot he/staggered toward' him and
said: "A-mah"sald to me,~ 'Hold -up your
hands.'^Hurryi" and: get some help.\"
Cramer, said- he did .not 'think of men
tioning that fact before. â¢' .
Harry'Harisel,. proprietor of a saloon
at Spear "and' : Folsom streets, ;; and the
former proprietor .of McLaughlin's sa
loon,' identified "Morrissey, and John
Reynolds as two men who called at the
latter place' between ; ,6:3o and 7,' o'clock
on the night of .the murder. Thpy acted
as if they, meant, to do something,, but
a special policeman came along* and
they left, the saloon. This contradicts
Morrissey's ? statement that he "was \ not
in the neighborhood : after, 4 o'clock that
aflernoori. Reynolds was : one of the
two men found in ; Morrissey's room: at
the time'/ of his arrest; on -Thursday

an Appeal to the United

-Forsaken by his bride of a. year, who
has become infatuated with the peculiar
doctrines enunciated by i)r. Cyrus R.
Teed, of Koreshan ! fame, Walter ;/W.; /W.
Hoag, a carpenter,' residing at 4C7>O'Far

United States law officers in a last at
tempt to dissuade his spouse from joining
the Teed colony. In Florida. .-. .; \u25a0
_\u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0 For weeks, the abandoned husband de
clares, '.' he j tried . every,, argument and
every persuasion : he could muster to pre
vent his g wife from \u25a0 uniting i with the
strange prophet of. Koresh.^but, to no
purpose. v She has, left him, and with her

Teed's descent .upon. San Francisco a few
years: ago. .As "the; prophet of IKoresh,"
whatever that might be, Teed established
himself : in; a community dwelling at Noe
and Beaver streets." The expounder of light
sbon found | himself- in the public eye un-,
pleasantly." Charges . were hurled at him
in! broadsides that he had separated many
wives frcm ( husbands. > had caused do

sitive minds. until he completely subdued
many of v ; his women followers. 1 ,>"\u25a0â¢\u25a0
HUSBAND- BLAMES TEED.
Teed met the attacks for a time, but
suddenly, he departed and was next heard
from in Florida, after holding forth for
awhile in Chicago. From the peninsular
settlement-. of Estero.TeeG began a prop
aganda which - has covered; the United
States. He' 1 has tollqwers in this city,
and, according- to Hoag. they and Teed's
publications are responsible for his wife's
defection.- ' â¢'
Hoag was married last year in St. Louis
to Mrs. Nona'C. McConnell, who came to
California with her husbanc and her. two
children.. Chalmers and Florence Jewel
McConnell." in the fall. They* took a home
at 4124 J. street, Oceanside, and there Mrs.
Hoag : heard \u25a0of * the.- Kpreshans.' ... Hoag
took no stock in the jumble -of rellglo
scientific publications and from the start
combated his spouse." His story. follows:
"As soon as my wife became so earnest
about this Koreshan ' business I -made
some investigations and soon learned that
Teed had left San' Francisco in very bad
odor. But all that I could say or do
would not .convince Mrs. Hoag. .She in
sisted that she ; had found the truth, and
she ! eternally- harped t on a lot of stuff
about, the unities and the esoteric life un
til I â¢became / "convlnced her mind- was
weakening.
WIFE CHOOSES THE PROPHET.,
"After weeks or effort I told her finally
that it was a case of- Teed or myself. She
chC3e Teed and start<*J for. Florida, tak
ing her daughter with her.
I "Mrs. Hoag went to her brother-in-law,
Charles Biehl, 1406 Baugh avenue, St.
Louis/ and there she continued to declare
she should go on to join the Koreshans
at ; Kstero. \ Since her departure "I.. have
given up my home and . have , gone to
rooming: with' her son, a young; man IS
years old, who is very much opposed to
his mother's 'actions.
"She has wiitten to him in efforts to in
duce him to Join her tithe trip .to the
Teed colony. 'But he will not go.
' ,'!Most of my wife's "hallucinations come
from her frequent seances with Miss A.
Jensen,' one" of; his , followers,- who night
after nlgh.t drilled the Koreshan doctrine
into fcer head. So vlDlent'is" their attitu-Je
that this woman ; declared iin my hearing
that' she would suffer. torture rather than
to abandon Teed's so-called revelations.'
"When Mrs. Hoag '. departed ;.she' said
she should go to Florida as soon as she
had said .'farewell*, to her relatives in St.
Louis.' She. everi trkjd'to persuade her
aged father. J.I R. Roe, to accompany her
to the colony.rHibls' staying with his son
in-law, Otto 2431 Agnes avenue,
Kansas CityUjÃut, they" would have noth

.BEGS SO^'iTO JOIN HER.
-In a letter Tto'*,hcr son under date of

with her to Florida,' and concludes: . _
