ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 24.â Reports
of an alarming nature of the situation
there continue to pour out of the Far
East. These include the statements
that the Japanese are landing an army
at Masampho, Korea, and that 3000
Russian troops are crossing the Talu
River. The reported dispatch of a Chi
nese army of soldiers trained by Euro
pean officers beyond the great wall to
preserve order in Manchuria cannot be
confirmed here, and the reports of the
Japanese at Masampho and the Rus
sians at the Yalu are discredited at the
Foreign Office here and by Kurino, the
Japanese Minister to Russia.
While the Russian Government un
derstands the situation in Korea to be
disturbed, and possibly threatening, it
has no information of a situation grave
enough to warrant the landing of a
large Japanese force there. Russia free
ly admits Japan's right under existing
conventions to land in Korea a reason
able number of -soldiers to preserve or
der, but the landing of an army at this
stage of the negotiations could not be
viewed. with equanimity.
Kurino is in no way anxious because
of the delay in Russia's response to the

Japan is not pressing for an immediate
reply. ' â

BEDFORD, Ind.. Jan. 24. â Tho
mysterious murder of Miss Schaefer
remains unsolved. A well known
man of this city, who is a member of
the senior class at the State Universi
ty of Bloomington, was closeted to
day with detectives. He explained hla
whereabouts on the night of the mur
der. The reason for the Investiga
tion, it is alleged, was a story told by
Miss Schaefer's room-mate and cor
roborated by their landlady, that the
young man was requested on one oc
casion to leave Miss Schaefer's room
because of objectionable conduct.
The letter written to Chicago by
Miss Schaefer was to Mrs. Frank
Cross, her sister. In this letter, ac
cording to Mrs. Smith and Miss Love,
who roomed with Miss Schaefer, the
dead girl complained of the conduct of
this young man In attempting to kiss
her and It was in reply to this letter
that Mrs. Cross wrote: "I wish you

Marshal Burries employed John

to-night while he was in the Jail corri

the keys to Radford's cell. Dock at
first refused to deliver them. The
mob then gave him several blows on.
the head and drew their pistols, when
Dock promptly delivered the keys.
Kadford refused to leave the cell and
the mob began firing on him, several
shots taking effect. In all eight shots
were fired. The prisoner was dragged,

LONDON. Jan. 23. â Colonel
Lynch, who commanded the Irish
Brigade against the British forces dur
ing the war In SouthAfrlca and who was
afterward convicted of treason and sen
tenced to imprisonment for life, was
yesterday morning liberated "on li
cense." Lynch has not received thÂ«
royal pardon.
The liberation of Colonel Lynch is
the outcome of an interesting series of
events. When Michael Davitt was last
iiÂ» the United States he saw President
Roosevelt. who mentioned Colonel
Lynch to him, saying he had' once en
tertained him at Albany. The Presi
dent expressed great Interest in the
case and regretted that he could, not
suggest clemency without laying him
f elf open to a palpable snub. On hi.;
return to England. Dsvitt mentioned
his conversation with President Roose
velt to Uir Thomas Lipton and to Mia.
Lynch, who has suffered bitterly since
her husband's arrest. He at once mads
a pathetic appeal to Sir Thomas, whu
then personally interceded with Kim;
Edward on behalf Â¦ of the condemned
fellow Irishman. Without any hesi
tation, the King promptly informed the
Home Secretary of his wishes and the
prisoner was released.
Colonel Lynch, who completed a year
in prison last Saturday, was the only
political offender In prison in Ireland.
Patrick A. McHugh, ex-member of the
House of Commons, who recently
shared this distinction with Colonel
Lynch, was released from jail through
the mediation of Sir Thomas Lipton
with King Edward.
Colonel Lynch will enjoy personal
liberty and may even leave the country
should he care to do so; but, not having
received the royal pardon, he 13 dis
qualified from sitting in Parliament
and from holding any public office.

true that these troops go with the pur

means war with China, and not with
Japan. In an interview Soo Wei Teh,
the Chinese Minister to Russia, is
quoted as-having said: ,, ;
"The talk of China going to war with
any one is absurd. We have no Inten

being sent north it is solely for the pur

burg Railroad tracks. . j
crest of the flood swell was reached at '
4 o'clock this afternoon, when the stage |
was fort:*-fcur feet two inches. Fully ,
ono-third of the homos in the city were
wholly or partially inundated, and the
sharp fall in the temperature has '
caused a great deal_ of suffering. On
the island very few streets are out of '
the water and many second stones are '
invaded, but the residents are accus
tomed to floods and have made ar
rangements accordingly.
In Benwood there is. not a single
block that is high and dry. and the 5000
persons there are living in second
stories or on the hillsides, while the suf- .
fering is intense. In Bellaire, Bridge
port and Martin's Ferry, on the Ohio
side, the situation is not so bad, as the :
ground is higher.

He had lived in Tillamook bounty for

residence of many years in Tillamook
County Alderman had acquired prop

Special Dispatch to The Call,
The Coroner's inquest will be held
to-morrow and the preliminary hearing
in the Police Court on Wednesday.
The police hope to be ready when Soe
der appears in the Police Court on
Wednesday to show enough evidence. of
his guilt to have him bound over for
trial in the Superior Court.
There is an abundance of evidence
to show the criminal nature and record
of Soeder. â¢ He has been in San Quentin
twice for burglary, once from this city
and once from Alameda County.
The shoes were at once taken to the
tracks and found to fit exactly in the
imprints in'the mud, which had become
somewhat hardened. This new evi
dence goes to prove that Soeder entered
his room on the night of the murder
through, the window. Landlord Xei
blas has said that if Soeder had come
in by the door he and his wife would
have heard him. Soeder chose the.win
dow as the least noisy means of egress,
in order that he might get into his
room and change the gray suit that he
was seen wearing the night he left the
Mexican restaurant on Broadway with
his brother-in-law, Blaise.
The police have about completed their
search for evidence against Sooder and
last night was spent by Detective Gib
son in getting into shape what he has
secured.
On the morning that the murdered
Blaise was found lying in the Taylor
street cut of Russian Hill Soeder's
landlord. Joseph Neiblas, discovered
shoe tracks in the moist earth of the
garden on which the front windows of
the room occupied by Soeder and Blaise
looks. Evidence was found that Soeder
changed his shoes after the murder
was. .committed. A pair of calfskin shoes
of a" peculiar shape were found in Soe
der's Toakn on the Monday-following the
murder. They were of an English bull'
dog shape of an uncommon last.
When the shoes were found by De
tective Gibson they were covered with
mud of the same variety that lines the
cut in Russian Hill, where the dead
body of Blaise was found. They were
taken as evidence and it was not until
several days later that Neiblas called
the attention of the police to several
well-defined shoeprints in the garden
in front of the window to Soeder's
room.
A valuable piece of evidence has been
secured by the police against Leon Soe
der, charged with the murder of Joseph
Blaise. The shoes worn by Soeder on
the night of the murder have been
found to fit to a nicety the shoeprint
marks discovered in the yard under
the front window of the room in which
Soeder and Blaise lived. Â¦

Johnny Ray does a peculiar line of

ticeable was the reduction in corpu
lence in Emma Ray.- Instead of the
massive actress that "kicked her hus
band about the stage while he per
formed that office at home." she has
grown more to proportion and Johnny
seems to stand a better chance Jn life.
They, produce i very good sketch, "A
Hot Old Time,", and there is no mis
take about theirbeing favorites in this
city. . "
People that paid their $2 apiece to- see
"David Harum" at the Columbia Thea
ter last season can obtain equally good
seats in the Grand Opera-house, this
week for less than half that amount of
money and witness almost as trood a
production of the same play. True It
is that "Billy" Crane is not doing the
title part, but the actor who has suc
ceeded him. William H. Turner, fol
lows the Crane method so closely as
to sustain all the effective phases of
the original characterization, and
thereby pronounces himself a most ar
tistic imitator. Nor is the present
company just as strong, individually
or collectively, as its predecessor, but
it is strong enough to do full justice to
every personation in the group. All
the original scenery has been retained,
and in a mighty good state of preser
vation it li>, when one considers the
wear and tear to which it has been
subjected. â¢ ' ' Â¦ â¢
It is payinrc inadequate tribute to the
excellence ofÂ» "David Harum" . to say
that it Is the best* show given at the
Grand Opera-house since "Ben Hur"
was there, for the interim was filled
by some of the toughest itinerants
that ever struggled westward. To state
that the dramatization, of Mr. Wes
cott's clever character story is worth
double the prices charged for the priv
ilege of witnessing it would be no ex
aggeration. ... ...
It was an organization of amateurs,
the Alameda Lustspiel Ensemble, that
played ."Als . Ich. Wiederkam" (."As. I
Returned") last evening at the Colum
bia Theater, and positive knowledge "of
that fact was necessary to convince the
stranger that dropped in that he was
not being entertained by well-trained
professionals. In the audience were
some students of stage technique to
whom much.of the German, dialogue
was unintelligible, but they seemed to
derive no less enjoyment from the per
formance than was reflected by the fre
quent and hearty laughter of those who
understood the full significance of the
lines. That is saying something favor
able for the dramatic instinct and Intel
ligence of the players. It is no 'exag
geration at all to state that the work' of
some of the principals has never been
excelled in completeness on the same
stage. . Â¦ . . â¢ -â¢ â¢'.
It was in the little thingsâ the mlnu
taeâthat the art of the actors'mani
fested itself.- Perfect self-possession
and poise were qualities possessed by
all, but it was more than absence of
self-conscionsness that contributed the
deft side playsâ the appropriate shrugs,
smiles, pouts and other expressive pan
tomime â that made the silent charac
ters appear so essential to the stage
picture white two or more of the. other
characters' were conversing. There was
none of the vapid, chorus-girl-like gaz
ing at the audience, that mars the nat
uralness'and harmony of situations in
the best American managed dramatic
offerings. Every one of those amateurs
seemed to be perfectly imbued with the
spirit of the play and to thoroughly
"leel" the character he or she -was im
personating. Stage direction may have
been responsible for some of this-re
markable self-effacement, but the best
stage director in the world could not
create the- artistic temperament. He
could only guide it.
"As I Returned" is a sequel to "At
the White Horse Tavern," played by
the same company several weeks ago,
and it simply places the same char
acters in new and equally ludicrous
situations. Throughout the â¢ perform
ance the big audience was kept in an
alternation of giggles and guffaws, and
the finish of each act was followed by
a clamor that brought the leading: peo
ple before the curtain several times.
The staging was as perfect as the act
ing, so it was no cause for wonder when
Stage Manager Arthur Beeker was
noisily summoned to the front to re
ceive a great ovation. A vocal quartet
and an invisible mandolin orchestra
interpret charming music.
The company is now rehearsing: an
other clever German comedy. "Das
Opferlamm," and it would be well for
San Francisco's large army of aspi
rants for dramatic recognitionâ aye,
and some of the ; fat-salaried profes
sionals â to witness .its- production.
Even if they do â¢Â¦ hot; understand the
language of the fatherland, -they may

charges against him. "While the Ser

All physicians agree that the element
of faith has a great deal to do In the
cufe,Jof disease. _ Â¦'
t Firm belief and confidence in a fam-
ilyv physician or the 1 same confidence
and faith Jn a ; patent.. medicine have
produced remarkable cures In all ages.
This is especially true in nervous
"troubles." arid no held" offers so prolific
a. harvest for the quack and charlatan
as the diseases arising. from a'weak or
run-down, n^rvous system.
. Nevertheless^ the "most common of all
diseasesâ indigestion and stomach trou-
bles, which in turn cause nervous dis-
eases, heart troubles,' consumption and
loss of fleshâ require something besides

ONLY ONE WAY
TO PURIFY THE BLOOD, INCREASE
FLESH* AND STRENGTH AND
TO CURE INDIGESTION.
SECRET PATENT MEDICINES WILL
NOT DO IT.
There Is a Simpler and Better Way.
There is only one way to purify the
blood, only one way to increase flesh,
and that is through the stomach and
digestive organs. Why? Because the
stomach and digestive organs make
blood and flesh, bone, nerves and
sinew. Did you ever see a person blessed
with a healthy, vigorous stomach and
digestion who had impure blood,
muddy, sallow complexion, or who had
weak nerves, sleepless nights and the
thousand and one pains and aches aris-
ing from poor digestion? No; because
perfect digestion converts the food
free. Address F. A. Stuart Co., Mar-
shall, Mich.
ARE YOU THIN?
Do You Want to Become Flesh j?
A FEW SIMPLE RULES.
Flesh and Not Fat Is What Is Needed.
What thin people want Is flesh, and
not fat. To be symmetrical and prop-
erly nroportioned every person should
have a certain amount of flesh. To be
plump does not necessarily mean to be
fat. Fat is undesirable; it clogs and re-
tards the action of every muscle, Inter-
feres with the healthy action of th^
heart and lungs, and when excessive
predisposes to fatty degeneration of
vital organs, to say nothing of the dis-
comfort, more or less, resulting from
excessive adipose tissue.
Common sense would suggest that if
one wishes to become fleshy and plump
the thins most needed would be flesh-
forming foods; in other words, album-
inous foods, like eggs. beef, oatmeal.
etc. The kinds < f food that make flesh,
are the foods that form the greater
part of our daily bill of fare.
Now, the only reason so many peo-
ple remain thin is because their stom-
achs do not properly and completely
digest and assimilate the fiesh-formins
beefsteak and eggs we eat every day.
There are thousands of such people,
and they are really dyspeptic, although
they may not suffer any particular
rain or inconvenience from their stoin-
achs. If such persons would take, with
their meals, some preparation like
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets the food
would be quickly digested, and the
proper degree of plumpness very soon
secured, because these tablets are pre-
pared exactly for that purpose. They
will digest every variety of flesh-form-
ing food, which is the sole reason why
they so quickly build up and
strenethen thin, dyspeptic men and
women.
Stuart's Dysp-psia Tablets cure dys-
pepsia and every form of indigestion
on this common-sense plan, that they
digest the food promptlv. givinsf
strength to every nerve and organ of
the body, while at thÂ» same time tho
stomach has a chance to rest and re-
cover its natural vigor. Nothing fur-
ther is required cure any stomach
trouble.'or to make thin, dyspeptic peo-
ple strong, olump and well.

factured by F. a. Stuart L'o.. Marshall.

beauty.. /
Every person ' knows . whether or not
his or her digestion Is what. It should
be, but every person does not know
what Is the safest and best way to se-
cure and preserve a healthy condition
of the digestive organs. It is not done
by the use of any wonderful secret pat-
ent medicine, but by the use of certain
harmless digestive principles, which,
taken at meals, will digest the food
anyway, regardless of the weak condi-
tion of the stomach.
Dr. Brooks recommends a combina-
tion of vegetable essences, fruit salts,
pure aseptic pepsin and Golden Seal,
prepared in convenient tablet form, and
sold by druggists everywhere under the
name of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.
These pleasant tasting tablets are to
be dissolved in the mouth after each
mÂ«al, and. mingling in the food in the
Btomach. digest it perfectly. There Is
nothing wonderful about this. Any
physician or chemist knows that
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets will do this
because repeatedly tested and proved,
and thousands of cured dyspeptics have
found it to be true also.
Dr. Harlandson states that these tab-
lets Increase flesh because they digest
flesh-forming food like eggs, meat and
; ordinary every-day food; for the same
reason they purify the blood and
strengthen weak nerves. In no other
I way can it be done, because flesh, blood
and nerves are obtained from the food
i we eat.
Dr. Jennison once stated that he be-
lieved a, 50-cent package of Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets would give more real
benefit than fifty dollars' worth of or-
dinary doctor's fees.
These tablets may be found at any
drug store. V'
HEART DISEASE.
SOME FACTS REGARDING THE
RAPID INCREASE OP HEART
TROUBLES.
Do Not Be Alarmed, But Look for
the Cause.
Heart troubles, at least among Amer-
icans, are certainly increasing, and
while this may be largely due to the
excitement and worry of American bus-
iness life, It Is more often the result of
weak stomachs, of poor digestion.
Real, organic heart disease is incur-
able; but not one case In a hundred of
heart trouble is organic
The close relation . .between ..heart
trouble and poor digestion is because
both organs are controlled by branches
of the same great nerves, the Sympa-
thetic and Pneumogastric.
In another way also the heart Is af-
fected by /that form of poor digestion
which causes . gas and fermentation
from half-digested food; there is a* feel-
ing of oppression and heaviness in, the
chest, caused by pressure of the dis-
tended stomach on the heart and lungs.
Interfering with their cction; hence
arise palpitation and short breath.
Poor digestion also poisons the blood,
makes it thin and watery, which Irri-
tates and weakens the heart.
The most sensible treatment for
heart trouble is to Improve the diges-
tion and to Insure the prompt assimi-
lation of food.
This can best be done by the regular
use after meals of some safe, pleasant
and effective digestive preparation, like
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, which may
be found at most drug stores, and
I which contain valuable, harmless di-
gestive elements in a pleasant, con-
venient form. "
Â¦ It Is safe to say that the regular
persistent use of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets at meal time will cure any
form of stomach trouble except cancer
of the stomach.

Little book on stomach trouble mailed
Medical books are not always inter-
esting reading, especially to people en-
joying good health, fcut as a matter of
fact scarcely one person In ten Is per-
fectly healthy, and even with such,
sooner or later sickness must come.
It is also a well-established truth
that nine-tenths of all diseases orig-
inate with the breaking-down of the di-
gestion; a weak stomach weakens and
impoverishes the system, making it
easy for disease to gain a footholdi.
Nobody need fear consumption, kid-
ney disease, liver trouble or a weak
heart and nervous system as Ions aa
the digestion is good and the stomach
able to assimilate plenty of whalesoma
food.
Stomach weakness shows itself in a
score of ways, and this little book de-
scribes the symptoms and causes and
points the way to cur? to simple that
any one can understand and apply.
â¢Thousands have some form of stom-
ach trouble and do not know it. They
ascribe the headache, the languor, ner-

LONDON, Jan-. 24.â The condition of
the Stock Exchange for the past week
seems to indicate the possibility of a
boom should the far Eastern crisis be
settled peacefully, j Almost all prices
showed recovery, although business
was very moderate. One of the chief
features of the week .was the strength
of the American market, both for bonds
and shares, which were bought largely
from the United States and Germany.
Berlin operators are still highly optim
istic regarding peace between Russia
and Japan, but the confidence in Am
erican securities appears to be based
upon the belief that a localized war
wc-uld greatly benefit the trade in the
United States and British Railways.
Foreign securities, including Japanese,
Chinese and Russians, all participated
in the recovery. The only exception
was the Kaffir market, where there was
complete stagnation.

The British battleship Hindustan was
launched December 19 at the Clydebank
shipyard, and another battleship, the
New Zealand, is to go into the water at
the end of February, and three others
of the same type, named King Edward
VII, Dominion and Commonwealth, are
approaching completion. They are of
16,350 tons normal displacement, 18,000
horsepower and eighteen knots speed.
The Hindustan was begun October 23.
1902, and her launching weight was 8000
tons, or 80 per cent of the calculated
completed total weight. The New Zea
land, building at the Portsmouth dock
yard, was laid down February 9, 1903,
and if launched as intended next month
will make a better record for rapid
construction than the contract*built
ship. "

The British battleship Prince of
Wales passed through her three stream
trials last month without a hitch. She
is a sister ship to the Queen. Identical
in all particulars except boilers, which
are of the Belleville type in the Prince
of Wales and Babcock . . ''Wilccx in
the Queen. The latter ship was also
tried last month and while the horse-:
power and speed developed was prac
tically the same for the two ships there
was considerable difference in the coal
consumption, greatly in favor of the
Babcock Sz Wilson boiler. The figures
for the Belleville boilers amounted dur
ing the three trials under horsepower
of 312S, 11,669 and 15,364, to 2.21, 2.0S and
2.02 pounds, respectively, per unit of
horsepower. The Queen consumed only
1.84, 1.61 and 1.76 pounds of coal per
horsepower during the three trials un
der 203S. 11.670 and 15,556 horsepov/er.
The Babcock & W'ilcox type is evi
dently much better adapted for vessels
of war because of Its simplicity, the
accessibility of all its parts and the
economic results, and in the introduc
tion of this type of boilers in the ships
of- the United States navy, the Bureau
of Steam Engineering made a wise
selection.
Twenty-nine vessels, comprising five
classes, passed through their steam
trials in the British navy during 190o.
namely, four battleships, eight armored
cruisers, one protected ; cruiser, one
sloop and fifteen torpedo-boats. In the
United States one battleship, one moni
tor, four protected cruisers, two de
stroyers, one tropedo-boat and five sub
marine boats, a total of fourteen ves
sels, passed through their trials.
BRITAIN'S NEW WARSHIPS.
The names of forty-seven out of fifty
four Russian torpedo-boat-destroyer3
were recently changed, for some un
known reason, and this change of
names has given rise to the belief that
Russia was endeavoring to mystify
other nations as to its naval move
ments. Sucn a ruse could not very well
succeed, as none of the new names are
borne by other vessels in the Russian
navy, and because the several naval
authorities are too , thoroughly posted
on the number anÂ«T types of the navies 1
o- all countries to be deceived by Â«.
mere change of name. Russian names
receive spellings in foreign countries
that would puzzle a Russian. The new
nomenclature shows no improvement in
brevity, and it is difficult to understand
why the destroyer Skabe has been re
christened Btezpodshtchadni, and the
name of the Nyrock altered into Pora
geaconchty.

staff # is that of the creation of two
vice admirals, the natural inference
being that these high grade titles will
be conferred in 1905 upon the officers
heading the list of rear admirals, who
are Evans and Taylor. Thus, while the
general staff scheme may have for its
ultimate object the general welfare of
the navy, it looks as if its inception
was due to individual interest.

Schwab or the Schwab interests could
be listened to or considered unless he
agreed to these three things:

bonds 5chÂ«mb now holds, amounting to
about 510,000,000.
Secondâ ThfÂ» election of a new board

Thirdâ Placing the trust on its feet
by the issuance of $3,000,000 bonds,
ready money which would be needed,
which Schwab wants to take at a 20
per cent discount, or at 80. but which
he must take at par.
If Schwab cannot take up these three
proposals, no compromise is possible.
Schwab has had this offer under con-
Fidoration, or at least he has heard of
it, but he has made no answer to it.

OPPOSITION" OFFERS
COMPROMISE TO SCHWAB
One of Rear Admiral Taylor's propo
sitions in connection with the general
The greatest and most effective oppo
sition to the general staff scheme of the
navy will come from the Senate Naval
Committee, of which Senator Hale has
been the chairman for fifteen years.
Other Senators and Representatives
will join him to defeat the plan of
Rear Admiral Taylor, which would
seriously encroach on the prerogatives
of Congress and the Secretary of the
Navy, and there is no chance of suc
cess of the scheme unless it is shorn of
all its objectionable features. The pro
posed scheme is simply a resurrection
of the Board of Navy Commissioners,
which existed from 1815 to 1842, and
then succumbed, to "dry rot." It was
succeeded by the bureau system.
The line officers of the navy, and
especially those who have been located
in Washington for many years, have
at f reauent intervals agitated for a re
turn to the old system, which gave ihc
line such enormous power to directly
and indirectly manage affairs of the
navy, with an eye chiefly toward In
dividual benefit. It is claimed that the
proposed general staff scheme has been
planned for the purpose of providing a
number of naval officers and their ad
herents, in Washington, with high posi
tions and the resultant elevated ranks
and increased pay. It is alleged that
the two brothers-in-law. Rear Admirals
Taylor and Evans, are the chief pro
motors. Taylor, who is Chief of the
Bureau of Navigation, and retires
March 4. 1907. is slated for a cruise
before retirement, and Evans, whose re
turn to Washington is due next April,
â¢will want a position of greater import
ance than that of President of the
Lighthouse Board. Evans having
served his yiota at sea is, therefore,
entitled to shore duty until his retire
ment in August. 1908. In the meantime
Admiral Dewey. now over 66 years of
age, will probably retire, leaving Evans
and Taylor as the two ranking officers
Iri the navy. v
TAYLOR'S SCHEME.
The line officers of the United States
navy are unanimously of the opinion
that the present organization of the
Navy Department is unsatisfactory
and that a general staff, somewhat
similar to that recently introduced in
the army, is needed. Rear Admiral
Henry C. Taylor has formulated a plan
which has been approved by all the
line. officers in Washington, but Secre
tary Moody does not give it his un
qualified approval, and certain Sena
tors and Representatives are known to
be opposed to the radical changes pro
posed. The plan is to have the general
staff, to be composed of the admiral,
real admirals and other high grade
officers, assume the responsibility of
determining the wants of the navy, to
prepare plans of defense and campaign,
to determine the types of ships wanted
and the strength of the personnel and
to have general direction and control
of the administration of the navy
afloat and ashore. The several exist
ing bureaus are to be continued, but
are to be under the control and direc
tion of members of the general staff.
Under such a reorganization the Sec
retary would become a mere figurehead
and the bureau chiefs of special scien
tific training mere advisers to the gen
eral staff, entitled to no credit, but
held responsible as under present con
ditions for possible failures.
There does not appear to be any ne
cessity for such a radical reorganiza
tion. The present general board, ap
pointed by the Secretary of the Navy,
is performing the duties of advising
the Secretary on all matters pertaining
to material, personnel and affairs in
general, though it does not exercise
control, and the department has the
benefit of the opinions of the bureau
chiefs interested with the design and
construction of ships, machinery and
ordnance. The intervention of mili
tary officers, having no intimate
knowledge in scientific and mechanical
branches, would only lead to confusion
and general dissatisfaction and thus
defeat the very object for which the
general staff is assumed to be neces
sary.

VIENNA, Jan. 24. â Reports are being

Ferdinand Charles, nephew of Emperor
Francis Joseph, and brother of the heir
presumptive to the throne, Archduke
Fraflcis Ferdinand, is determined to
marry Bertha Czuber, daughter of a
professor of mathematics in Vienna
University, and it is even asserted
that the wedding has been fixed for
February 13 at Dresden.
An official paper, the Magyar Nem
zet, however, declares that these re
ports should be received with the ut
most reserve. It says, also, that Em
peror Francis Joseph, without whose
consent it is Inconceivable that the
Archduke will contract such a union,
has never been approached on the sub
ject, and that it is impossible to fore
tell what, his decision would be in case
the proposition, reached him. Accord
ing to all reports the nearest relatives
of the Archduke are doing their utmost
to persuade him to abandon the pro
ject, but as to the result of their efforts
the reports are conflicting.

AALESUND, Norway, Jan. 24.â The
fire which swept over this town yester
day morning destroyed every building
in it with the exception of the hospital.
The 11.000 inhabitants of Aalesund were
compelled to camp in the open, as only
a few damaged and uninhabitable
houses were left standing. The chil
dren of the town had to be housed
temporarily in the church, at Bcrgiind.
The panic among the residents was
'so great after the outbreak of the
flames that all attempts at leadership
or discipline became out of the ques
tion. No excesses, however, were com
mitted. The people first endeavored to
save some of their property, but they
i soon found they had quite enough to
do. to save their own lives. The de
struction of the town was complete
within a couple of hours from the time
j the fire started.
More than twenty steam fishing boats
and many sailing smacks were sunk in
the harbor in order to save them from
I the flames^ but three steamships and
I many sraaPks were burned.

Bishop Innocent is a young man, be

proceed immediately to Alaska.
The see of the governing Bishop will

CHICAGO, Jan. 24.â Three suits for
a total of $330,000 have been filed in the
Circuit Court against P. N. Anderson
of this city. Nels O. Hultberg. a plain
tiff in one of the suits, seeks to recover
$500,000, while Dora Adams and Hanna
Hultberg ask for $15,000 each. Back of
the suits, according to the defendant,
is a story which had its beginning in
the Alaakan gold fields in 1898.
\When the rush for Alaska and the
Yukon was at its height Anderson was
one of the first to arrive at Nome, and
after prospecting for some time he lo
cated and filed the claim known as the
White Star property. He Incorporated
the White Star Mining Company with
a capital of $80,000. In 1900 he is said
to have sold his holdings in the com
pany for more than $1,000,000 and re
turned to the United States.
Nels' O. .Hultberg;, his wife and his
niece, Miss Dora Adams, claim to have
been the original prospectors at the
White Star mine, and Hultberg asserts
that; he struck gold in sufficient quan
tities to warrant working it and re
turned to Nome to file papers with the
land agent. He was delayed In reach
ing Nome and when he did apply at
the Government office he learned that
Anderson had already filed his claim.

snatchers and thieves have been dy
ing their illegal calling on the "thea

Francisco during the last few days and
several persons have reported the loss
of sparkling gems from their cravats
and shirt boeoms.
Dr. Edward W. Christensen. a local
dentist, related to-day how he had
been jammed between two men while
walking off of a ferry-boat on the San
Francisco side last night shortly before
8 o'clock and how a diamond stud val
ued at $200 had been pulled from his
shirt front. The long wire clasp on
the jewel prevented the thief from ac
complishing his . purpose.
Dr. Christensen's shirt bosom was
ripped by the wire, but his gem was
saved. The dentist grabbed the man.
after freeing himself from the. fellow's
confederate, who shouldered into
Christensen and prevented him from
moving freely. In the tussle that en
sued the diamond snatcher broke away
and made his escape in the crowd.

the Sunday schools of the Episcopal
churches of Oakland, Alameda and
Berkeley attended the joint missionary
rally of the Episcopal Sunday schools
of Alameda County, held at 3 o'clock
this afternoon at St. John's Episcopal

land.
Detective Bailey made an investiga
tion and believes that the death was
accidental. Deceased was 53 years of
age, a native of Cincinnati, Ohio, and
a widower. The body was not removed
to the Morgue.
It is believed the unfortunate man.
upon being called in the morning,
lighted the stove to heat the room, that
he then returned to bed a.d fell asleep,
and that in some manner the stove
blaze was extinguished.
A gas tube leads from a jet In the
room to a small gas stove used for
heating purposes. The Jet was turned
fully on, permitting the gac to fill the
chamber.
Henry L- Schnler. proprietor of a
saloon at the northeast corner of
Haight and Stanyan streets, was as
phyxiated yesterday under somewhat
peculiar circumstances, but the police
and Morgue officials incline to the
theory that death was the result of aa
accident, ar.d not of suicide.
Shortly after 8 o'clock yesterday
morning Mrs. Behaver, who was em
ployed as cook by the deceased, called
him through a speaking tube leading
from the dining-room to his sleeping
apartment. Schnier replied to the sum
mons and stated that he would be
down shortly. Owing to his non-appear
ance by 2 o'clock a Mrs. McKenzie
went to his room to awaken him. Upon
opening the door she was startled to
find Schnier's dead body on the bed.

A: J. Snyder said:
The outlook fcr building operations for 1904
1* good. There has been a depreciation in the
price of material which should increase the
building of dwellings a great deal. 1 intend
to commence the erection of five houses on
the Merrill tra'-t ai oner? and shall build more
is soon aa the street work is finished.

Statistic? compiled by Sanitary In
spector S. F. Gemmel show that more
buildings of all kinds were erected in
Oakland during 1903 than in any
j-receding year in the history of the
city, and this is also true of the entire
* ounty. The figures show that the
lotal number of private dwellings
erected or nearly completed at the
t lose of IS03 was 54TÂ», an increase .of
199 over 190^. During 1903 seventeen
i-tores were erected, as compared With
sixteen of the preceding year. A
noticab:e feature of the building of
lisl year was that the dwellings
?-rected are as a rue of a more ex
j-ensive style than formerly.
Frank J. Woodward, president of
the Onkland Real Estate Association,

The concealed weapon consisted of a
loaded revolver and the discovery that
Whitaker was "heeled" is to the credit
of vigilant Patrolman George Brown
of the Piedmont district. Whitaker was
headed homeward along Piedmont ave
nue late last night when the police
man, on his rounds, observed the be
iated pedestrian. Brown hailed the
wayfarer, as the order requires, and
demanded to know his identity. Then
he made a search of Whitaker's pock
ets and brought forth the contraband
weapon. Thereupon was the pistol
wearing author haled into custody.
Herman Whitaker, one of Oak
land's [literati, enjoys the distinction of
having his name recorded on the blot
ter at the City PriFon as the alleeed
violator of a municipal ordinance that
prohibits the carrying of a concealed
weapon without the required permit.
But the author and writer was not
subjected to the further indignity of
spending a night behind jail bars, as
the deposit of a $10 gold piece was
made as a guarantee for Whitaker's
appearance to-morrow morning in the
Police Court.

Entertainment for the Veteran*.
TOUXTV1LLE, Jan. 24.â An inter
esting comedy was presented at the
Veterans' Home last evening under tha
direction of Mrs. F. W. Ross of San
Francisco. The entertainment was
given by the Frank Bacon company.
The play. "The Hills of California." was
full of interest for the men and was
splendidly produced. Those in the cast
were: Frank Bacon, Jane Weldman,
Clarie Sinclair. Bessie Bacon. Lester
Nollman. Joseph Carroll. Adolph An
gus, Wallace Hunt. Wilford Rozer.
Milton Ross and Master Francis Bacon.
Some fine music was rendered by the
Veterans' Home orchestra and a cor
net duet played by Julius F. Blattner
and Joseph Bryson. members of the or
chestra, was especially good. A tenor
solo by Adolph Angus was much ap
preciated. ; ;*_,.â¢
The fifty-fourth annual convention of
the Episcopal church in -the diocese of
California will meet in Grace Church,
California and Stockton streets,
morrow morning at 11 o'clock. Holy
communion will be administered by
Bishop Nichols, assisted by - clerical
members of the standing committee.
The convention , sermon will be
preached by the Rev. Mardon D., Wil
son, secretary of the diocese and rector
of Christ Church, San*Jose. The ses
sions v/ilr last four days, and include a
grand missionary meeting for Tuesday
evening at Trinity Church, at which,
besides the Bishop, Rev. F. \V. Clam
pett, D. D.; JRev. E..J. Parsons and oth
ers will make addresses. â¢ The music
will bo rendered by the vested choirs of
this city and Oakland, consisting of 200
men and boys, directed by W. L. Sabln,
organist of St. Luke's Church. An im
mense attendance is expected.
For Wednesday evening a reception
to Bishop Nichols, visiting delegates
and churchman generally ham been ar
ranged by the Church Club, a powerful
organization of laymen, to be held In
the- parlors of the Palace Hotel. '
MAY NOT DEBATE RITUALISM.
On Thursday the convention will con
: tinue its sessions, and Friday will be
devoted to the work of the diocesan
branch of the Woman's Auxiliary: It is
not believed that any reference to the
ritualistic element in the church will
be made at this convention, but a con
flict is anticii>ated over the proposed
adoption of certain canons.
On this account the present conven r
tion is regarded with some anxiety in
certain quarters. The especial feature
of the present session will be the dis
cussion of the advance made in thÂ»
missionary affairs of the diocese,
which, it is urged by some prominent
delegates, is being stimulated beyond
the ability of the church to sustain.
The opponents of the Bishop's policy
are expecting some sort of a protest in
this direction.
wJLii .si:e many strangers.
The present convention will be re
markable en account of the- large
number of new faces among the. clergy
and lay delegates, owing to thelos3 by
death and removal from the State oi
so many of those whose faces have
betn long familiar in the councils of
the diocese. Efforts will be made to
raise the J27.00O required for the erec
tion of an Episcopal residence, whic*i
th* ladies of the diocese have prom
ised to furnish when built, and for
which a beautiful lot has been bought
and paid for.-

Episcopal Church Convention
Will Begin To-Morrow and
Extension Will Be Discussed
Have . you ever wandered over the
grassy slopes of Telegraph Hill, in and
out of the cul de sacs, up and down
the rickety fllehts of stairs that lead,
to eyrie flower patches, or Into the
shadowy courts that lie between the
bee - hive tenements swarming with
little brown - eyed foreigners? If
not. then you have not known
the privileges of a San Fran
ciscan. If you have, then you will
know what one little woman has been
trying to do for these strangers to our
shores, to our customs and to our pro
gressiveness. It is Miss Bettie Asheâ
she who founded and has carried on
.successfully the Telegraph Hill settle
ment work, which, by the way, is being
magnificently duplicated at the other
side of the city, where the masses of
the toilers dwellâ in the South Park dis
trict.
Xow, Miss Ashe needs money. Her
work of treating the sick, supplying
nurses for the needy, looking" after the
poor little "padroned" urchins whose
hearthstone is the pavement, and whose
â¢ 'care'.' means the possession of a goodly
chunk of brown bread (not Boston) and
a goblet of wineâ these are the cares,
and they use up in very short notice a
few drabs of dollars.
Now, to-night will bring the oppor
tunity of society and the clubwomen
who possess an "interest in these hu
manities to manifest the same by at
tending the "Cafe Chantant," in the
maple room of the Palace Hotel, and
contributing their dollarâ two if they
wishâ to the settlement's work on Tele
graph Hill. And besides the gratifica
tion of conscience fora good deed'Hone,
there will be a merry time^- a real
boulevard nightâ in our stafd and emi
nently respectable Palace. There are
to be tables scattered.about, where beer
and its concomitants' will be dispensed
by the cleverest- maids in the smart
set; abetted ably by the beaux of club
dom. Among the latter are: Lloyd
Baldwin, Wilbur Burnett Gerald Rath
bone, Will Page, Athole McEean, Mr.
Petherick, Worthington Ames, Willard
Drown, Seward McXear, Sidney Salis
bury, Lieutenant Rousseau. IT. S. X â¢
Wilfrid Pase, Mr. Young. Karl Howard,
William Goldsborough, Millen Griffith.
James Jenkins, Coppee Thurston and
Thomas Berry.
Tables, have been engaged for the
unique. aftair by many of the fashion
able set, among, whom are: Mrs. Theo
dore Payne. Mrs. Eleanor Martin, Mrs.
Leonard Chenery, Mrs. Harry Mendell,

The Settlement shc-uld have, on the
morrow, a respectable sum to put with
its banker. And it will, assuredly,
with such able lieutenants.

are several of the musicians of the
Twentieth Century Club and Richard
M. Tobin. Dr. Wilhelmi Vail Blakewell,

The Papyrus Club had a red-letter
day last week when the members clev
erly dissected a large lot of English
humor. Mrs. S. Masofi Kinne. the presi
dent, assisted greatly in the elucida
tion of British wit. and â contrary to
pathological rules â it was grasped and
thoroughly appreciated by the club
member? and their guests. It is ex
pected of the Papyrus Club to graduate
from Its rolls some feminine Mark
Twains. Bill Xyes and Tom Burdettes,
that the club may demonstrate the ex
isting relation of women to wit.
The suest of the day was Mrs. Kate

Miss May Patton. formerly of the
County Hospital staff, but recently re
turned from a six months' tour of
Europe, gave a comprehensive paper on
the hospitals of the continent as com
pared with our local institutions, pub
lic and private. That our venerable
County Hospital was hardly in the A
class was rather conclusively proven â
if proofs be necessary. Miss Patton
knows her subject thoroughly and gave
liberally of her information.
A little talk on the "Treaty Between
General John C. Fremont and Colonel
Andrea Pico, .known as the Cahnlnga
Treaty," was given by a member in

The Ladies' Auxiliary cf the British
and American Union reassembled last
Monday after a short recess at Utopia
Hall, 2?S Sutter street. They had an
interesting gathering, and the mem
bers were delightfully entertained with
music and an excellent paper on ento
mology-by Miss Wright of Alameda.
Good diagrams and interesting speci
mens of beetles and butterflies proved
very interesting. The society meets
every second and fourth Monday Jn the

their American friends.
The success of the last "at home"

President Roosevelt, let it be known
abroad in clubdom and elsewhere, has
forwarded the California petition for
the preservation of the Calaveras big
trees to Congress, with some very per
tinent comment.
The New York Zoological Society last
week passed some very strong resolu
tions indorsing: the efforts put forth in
Congress for the safety of this mighti
est forest in the world.
This is all sweet music to the women
of the forestry section of the Cali
fornia Club (with whom the agitation
began four or five years ago), and the
energetic women of the Outdoor Art
League, who have communicated with
the political leaders in every State in
the Union in regard to the matter. So,
too, has the Semper Virens Club done
yeoman service in the matter. "Let
honor lie where honor is due."
There is yet much to do. It is earn
estly hoped that every Californian, and
especially the clubwomen who wield in
fluence in their communities, will
double their activities now at thin criti
cal moment. The San Jose clubs are
keenly alive to the work at hand. Vigil
ance means success.

A Nczv Trade.
One of the strangest occupations fol
lowed by the people of the teeming
East Side of New York is that of "dish
lender." There are only two men â one
a Hebrew and the other an Italianâ
in the business. They are located in
Baxter and Hester streets, respectively.
The former has his "establishment" in
the basement of a six-story tenement
house. The place is almost entirely
lined with rows of shelves, on which
are neatly arranged tea and dinner
services of varied colors and patterns,
besides dishes and plates of all kinds.
In one corner of the basement ia a
large wooden box, divided into numer
ous partitions, for the knives, forks,
spoons and other "silverware." Most of
the borrowers are as, regular as clock
work in their requirements on Satur

Representative Williams, called by an unkind fate to
the leadership of the Democracy in the lower house,
says that he doesn't know what a straight flush is. Mr.
Williams has sat so long and tried to look pleasant be
hind a pair of deuces in the political game that he probably
has forgotten what a good hand looks like.
THE Democracy cannot even locate the National
Convention without a row. It went to St. Louis,
and was dated at the hottest time of the summer
but the dispute about it was more torrid. Mr. Hearst
had a large contingent of the employes of his papers
present working for Chicago. He opposed New York,
because Tammany had said kind things about Cleveland
and did not invite him to the recent harmony dinner.
His sirens sang for Chicago, and when the committee
stuffed cotton in its ears and steered for St. Louis he
immediately caused it to be announced that the preda
tory influences which controlled the committee feared
him and had side-tracked Chicago on that account
Thereupon he telegraphed a printing office into St. Louis
and announced that one of his invincible newspapers
would be immediately established there, in order that the
people may read his own estimate of his greatness, and
his firm belief that he is the only fit nominee for the
Presidency-
Happy St. Louis! Happy Democracy! Â¦ It is "something

Needed Regulating.

supposed to strike only the hours, but
occasionally added an extra perform

in consequence, was a source of con

even more so, indeed, than the baby
brother that had come to live with her
about a month before.
One day baby brother's dinner did
not apparently agree with him, and a
fit of hiccoughs ensued. After a : few
moments' amazed contemplation of
this strange phenomenon, finger in
mouth and eyes riveted on the periodi

pink headed baby, the little girl sped
away to give the alarm.

Ignorance Is Bliss.
"You talk about ignorance," said a
well known naval officer connected
with the construction department at
Mare Island a few days ago; "there is
a man working in my department on
the navy yard who is certainly the
limit. About a week ago I went
aboard one of the vessels alongside
the quay wall to take a few measure
ments. I had forgotten that the ves
sel was in a very filthy state on ac
count of the repairs being made to
her hull, and wore my newest uni
form. Not wishing to spoil it I called
a man to me who was working
about the decks. I gave him my rule
and told him to measure the width
of a hole cut in the spar deck. He
disappeared between decks and was
gone attout ten minutes.
"When he came back he handed me
my rule extended to its full length
and placed at my feet a brick and a
short bar of iron. I was very much
puzzled, of course, and was about to
ask him what in the world he was
doing, when he saluted me and said:
'It is as wide as the stick, the brick
and the bit of iron put together." "
Odd Smuggling Device.
There is no end to curious devices for
smuggling. The Brussels correspond
ent of the Morning Advertiser says
that some time ago French customs
officers took possession o-f a block of
stone which they found in a truck be
longing to the Belgian State Railway,
and which weighed nrarly two tons.
The stone had been sent from Brussels
to Peroult Flamicourt. They turned it
over, and found that the underside had
been partially scooped, then covered
with a slab fastened with iron pins.
This was covered with a thick layer of
mortar. "When the slab was removed
700 pounds of tobacco was found In
the stone. An inquiry showed that this
block of stone had made several jour
neys between Belgium and France.
Sometimes .its cavity contained liqueur,
sometimes tobacco. The man who sent
it forth on its adventures was discov
ered. He belongs to Menin. Brought
before the courts in Brussels, he was
fined $20 for making a false declaration
of merchandise. He has yet to be dealt
with by the French authorities.
No Respect.
Superior Judge Greene of Alameda
County tells a good one about jj Dr.
Samuel Merritt and Sabin Harris, the
cattle dealer. Years ago, when the
old doctor, who weighed something
over three hundred pounds, was Mayor
of Oakland, he was strolling down
Twelfth street, near the estuary, when
"Sabe" Harris came along driving a
band of cattle which he had purchased
in San Joaquin County. One of the
wild steers made a rush for the portly
Mayor, who fortunately was near a
place where the two lower boards had
been knocked off the fence. Through
the aperture thus left he rolled to a
place of safety on the opposite side of
the fence from that near which the
baffled steer stood snorting and paw
ing the ground. â¢
In the process of reaching such asy
lum Dr. Merritt lost both his dignity
and his breath. When he had partially
regained the latfer he struggled to his
feet, shook his fist at Harris and ex
claimed: "How dare you! Do you
know who I am, sir?"
"Oh, yes, doctor," drawled Harris,
"I know who you are, but you'll have
to excuse the steer. He's from the
Joaquin and ain't been interdooced."
THERE is a grim superstition prevalent that no new
century can be born upon this world without a bap
tism of blood. Those mournful ones who croak this
shibboleth point to the record of history for justification
of their pessimism. Looking no further back than the
beginnings of modern history they point to each suc
cessive century's advent with its record of devastating
wars. In the year 1604 the Netherlands were drenched with
the blood of the patriots who were fighting their Span
ish masters, and Germany was torn with religious strug
gles. In 1704 the Seven Years' War was at its height.
Blenheim had just been fought and the war was being
carried on- in the jungles of India and the wilderness of
North America. The year 1804 saw the army of Na
poleon crowding the provinces of all Europe with the
tagles of the newly proclaimed Emperor. Now at the
opening of the twentieth century does the note of dole
still sound!
At the present moment there are battles and the move
ments of armed men in almost every portion of the planet.
Australia, Greenland and the dim. unexplored regions
about the south pole^ are the only lands upon the Al
mighty's fair footstool which do not sound with the
crash of arms or mutter with impending struggle. In
Europe the Balkans are still boiling. In Africa the Brit
ish are mowing down Dervishes with Gatlings. In South
America a revolution is singing merrily in the Uruguayan
kettle. North America has to admit that all is not lovely
in Santo Domingo and Panama. Finally in Asia there is
gathered such a war cloud that its seemingly inevitable
thunder clap will shake the world. Every nation that
can afford it is building herself navies, arsenals and
fortresses. The weaker members of the great family are
hastily taking to cover. It seems that all of the children
of Adam are awaiting, muscle tense, the sounding of
some inevitable signal for the joining of battle.
Within the century just passed thpe occurred some of
the most sanguinary wars the world ever witnessed. Yet
with that same century there was born a universal feel
ing that the millennium days of eternal peace might be
found in the twentieth century. From no less a head
than the anointed of all the Russias came the appeal for
peace, which widened and spread downward until the
meanest nation had caught the lilt of the peace song.
At The Hague tribunal were to be brought all of the ills
of the world for the salve of arbitration.
Even the most optimistic have been brought to ac
knowledge, however, that there can no more be a time
of peace in these days than in the past. The wage of war
is even greater now than it was two hundred years ago.
Catherine of Russia fought Frederick the Great because
the latter passed some personal comments upon her pri
vate life, and Pompadour urged France into war for the
same reason. But now when the nations are all restless
in their land getting and the rewards of a bold stroke
may be the control of a continent, the old selfishness
which has been since Jacob coveted Esau's heritage can
not bend to the altruistic dictates of sentiment and put
aside the old law that might is right.
THE BAPTISM OF WAR.
A Word From Marxsz'ille.
The following from the Marysvilla
Daily Appeal demonstrates the fact
that merit Is not unrewarded:
"For several months past we have
been attracted to the San Francisco
Call by Its entire change of makeup
and its general newsy and wideawake
appearance.
"Its news columns literally beam
with the news of the day presented in
an up-to-date and really very clever
and interesting manner, and its edito
rial page is certainly one of the most
ably written and highly educational of
any of our coast exchanges. The Call
is surely making great gains in circu
lation, and its advertising columns
speak for themselves, as its pages are
filled to overflowing with advertise
ments from al the enterprising and pro
gressive merchants of San Francisco,
not to say anything of the vast amount
of Eastern business it carries.
"The Call's hew undertaking of jgx
ploiting the resources and enterprises of
California is a grand work and Is daily
adding to its already great influence
and prestige."
In the arrest and occasional confession of fiends that
robbed the dead and dying in the Iroquois Theater disas
ter, Chicago is suffering a shocking sequel to her calam
ity in which the nation deeply sympathizes. It seems in
credible that human nature in its modern environment can
exploit such unspeakable degradation, but since it does
legislation to meet it with fitting punishment is justified.
daughters, maybe, whose intended hus
bands are always entertained at tea
those days, accounting for this. There
is more money spent in this way among
the Eastsiders than is generally sup
posed.
TRADE seems to have turned a corner during the
past fortnight. All signs now point to a- good,
healthy spring business. There are no disquieting
indications anywhere and the onl> r unsatisfactory feature
visible is the number of large failures which have oc
curred since the first of the year, but these are a regular
annual feature and to be expected. The movement in
merchandise seems to be expanding rather than contract
ing and all parts of the country report plenty of money,
with collections up to the average. In New York funds
are so plentiful that a plethora is actually reported and
interest is down to i}i to 2 per cent for call loans, while
time money can be had at 3 per cent. As long as money
is in such liberal supply there can be no serious finan
cial disturbance in the immediate future, barring, of
course, some sudden and unexpected catastrophe, which
is not likely to happen.
The bank clearings continue to show a loss from last
year, illustrating the contraction in general business from
the boom conditions of a year ago, and all the largest
cities except St. Louis, San Francisco, Kansas City and
New Orleans show a deficit. Â¦ New Orleans " exhibits a
large gain of 38.8 per cent, due probably to the continued
large dealings in cotton there. The loss at New York' is
*7-3 pf cent, due to the decline in speculation in Wall
street. Chicago about balances, the decrease being prac
ticall}' nothing. The aggregate volume of clearances
keeps up, being $2,110,000,000 for the week. The failures
for the week were 358, against 265 for the corresponding
week in 1903.
Weather conditions, as far as transportation of mer
chandise is concerned, have been against the railroads of
late, but in spite of this drawback the earnings thus far
in January are 4.9 per cent over those of 1^03. The same
conditions have also interfered with general trade, but
even with this adverse, factor expansion in spring busi
ness is reported over the whole West, while even the
East, which has been behind the West for some time, re
ports rather more movement than expected. The iron
trade continues irregular, being good in some sections
and poor in others, though the situation in this industry
as a whole is satisfactory. Lumber and building material
are rather quiet at the moment, as is usually the case in
midwinter, but a good movement is promised for the
spring. The general opinion in the iron and steel trade
is that bottom prices have been touched for the present.
As far as the other staples are concerned the situation
seems encouraging. Wheat is selling at better prices
than have prevailed since 1898, owing to an excellent mill
ing and export demand, though in our local market this
grain is not being exported, as holders decline to come
down to the bids of exporters. The demand for corn
and oats is reported good throughout the West, with
higher quotations during the past few days. Increased
strength and activity in hides are reported, while Boston
quotes the shoe and leather markets firm at advances.
The same city reports wool shipments larger than at the
same time last j'ear. Chicago and St. Louis report ex
panding orders for necessaries, such as clothing, shoes,
leather, hardware and groceries, and at the latter point
Southwestern buyers are purchasing freely, even in the
face of higher prices. In the lake regions general busi
ness is reported better on the whole than at the corre
sponding time in 1903.
The provision market, however, is not in a satisfactory
condition and is attracting some attention on this ac
count, as provisions share with iron and steel the reputa
tion of being good barometers to the condition of gen
eral trade. The distributing points throughout the West
are bullish on the market and are buying freely, while
the packers are selling them as freely. The tendency in
quotations is downward, and as stocks are accumulating
the best posted operators express the opinion that still
lower prices will prevail. The production seems to be
larger than the current consumption in this line.
Wall street continues tame and featureless. The tone
is cheerful and business is fair, but the public are still
holding aloof from the market. The war cloud in the
East, while not as dark and threatening as a month ago,
is still sufficiently menacing to render speculators and
investors wary about entering the market. Hints that
Russia is waiting for spring before making any serious
demonstration keep the market in a condition of doubt
and uncertainty, and every fresh movement of troops in
Manchuria, Japan or Korea is but another setback to the
speculating public. It is not likely that Wall street will
emerge from its present quietude until the Eastern ques
tion gets definitely settled one way or the other.
Conditions in California remain about the same, with
this exception, that rains in the southern part of the
State, while not copious, have brightened things consid
erably in that section and allayed a good deal of appre
hension as to the crop outlook, which was becoming
serious. Cattle and sheep were dying on the ranges, but
the grass is now beginning to grow, and with another
shower within a few days feed will probably be sufficient
to carry the stock along. The northern and central por
tions of the State are in excellent condition for the grow
ing crops, though the rainfall up to date is deficient. Cold
weather and heavy frosts have kept the fruit buds back,
thus decreasing the liability of damage by frost later on,
while they have not seriously damaged the new pastur
age or growing cereal crops. For the rest money con
tinues plentiful at reasonable rates of interest, the export
and internal trade of the State are both good, building
operations continue on a large scale, real estate is chang
ing hands freely, with prices tending upward, and the
merchants are not complaining, though all report.busi
ness lighter than at this time last year, with a gradual
decline in the generality of commercial quotations.
The main secret of his power was not
his gift of lyrical expression, great aÂ«
that was. but his ability to touch the
human heart. He was a man of strong

disappointment songs of hope and
And not only that, but Burns, along j
with Scott, has made the Scotland of 1
to-day, the Scotland which foreigner j
know, the Scotland of romance, the j
S<-"tland in whoÂ« reflected glory j
Scotchmen are wont to ba?k with se
rene satisfaction. The cottac<* near ]
"Allovmy's hauntfd kirk," where Burns
â¢was born \ih yc3rs agn, has become a
shrine for j-ilKrims. and all the places j
around which his genius has thrown the |
glamour of romance are visited year j
by year by thousands of admirers from ;
fill ;*arts of the earth. It is said that i
twice as many pilgrims go to Ayr as to I
Stratford -on -A von.
One of the tests of genius of the first
water i* that its influence continues |
to grow after th^ lapse of time. Burns j
has stood this topt. His star is still In |
the ascendant. Sneaking with true |
prophetic vision he said of himself: "I j
will be more respected 100 years aftÂ«*r '
I am dead than I am at present."
Burns paw thinps straight and he I
speaks of them in language that all :
can understand. His style Â« clear and
l'mpid as a mountain brook, except \
when he turr.s from his native Doric \
and writes in Knglish; and then it is ]
turgid and bombastic. The Scotch dia- ;
lect in which he wrote has the appear- !
ance of being rude and uncouth, an<l
for the expression of certain ideas it
Is admittedly poverty-stricken. But :t i
is a good vehicle for the expression of
the emotions. It is a good language to
sing in, to pray in, or to make love in.
Burns found it an oxe^llent instrument
for his purpose. Many study it to-day
with patient care in order to dig up
the treasures which he has locked Â«ip
within it. But for him it would soon
have passed away.
This raises the question: Is Burns
one of those poets who are praised but
not read? Yes, and no. Only a few
read him thoroughly, so as to study
him, but the best of his Bongs have be
come the heritage of the whole English
speaking world.
In his songs, and especially in his
love songs, his rare poetic gift shines
forth. The tragedies of his life came
from his very excess of sentiment. His
strength of passion, combined with
his weakness of moral restraint, led to
his undoing and to the undoing of
others. This he himself pathetically
confesses in the following stanza, which
Sir Walter Scott has said "contains the
essence of a thousand lcr- tales":
I!a<! wo never lovwl sae kindly,
Ha^ we never !ovo<i saÂ«" blindly.

ter than he lived. It is always well.
therefore, to distinguish between Burns j
the poet and Burns the man.
One of the main factors in his popu- I
larity among his own people is found Â¦
In the. effect of his creative geniu? upon 1
the national life. It has been said that j
before Burns' day Scotland was an idea Â¦
rather than a nation. Ke awoke within j
ft the national spirit. He gave to
Scotchmen that sense of unity which j
makes them feel their kinship the j
whole world over. When his pongs are j
sung the national consciousness is !
stirred and the national pride is .
touched. As they sing "Scots wha" hae ]
wi' Wallace Bled" Scotchmen feel a j
if w inches taller; they have a keener J
sense of their native importance and
proves?. They feel themselves to be Â¦
the peers of the best. And when in a j
foreign land they Join hands and sing '
"Auld Lang Syne" their hearts are I
fused into one and they feel like the j
scattered members of one family who j
have met once more under the patri- :
archal roof tree. Is there any wonder j
that thÂ«>y love the r>oet who stirs with- !
in th^m ?uch tender and noble senti- I
mentF?
There rs something pathetic in this ;
annual celebration. Not until after
Burns was dead did the world come to
realize his superlative genius. While
he lived his own countrymen put hir.i Â¦
under ban for his roystering life and Â¦
for his pavaco attacks upon the Church.
Now in their endeavor to condone for
their nojrlott of this wayward child of Â¦
genius th^y are in danger of going to !
the opposite extremeâ putting him upon
a i>edo5tal and doins him reverence.
Recently an enthusiastic Scotch ad- .

(C^j-risht. l!VÂ»t. by Joseph B. Bowles.)
At a xroman's lunch the other day
the question arose as to what would
be the special luxury in which each
person present would indulge had she
unlimited means. The answers were
various, some saying travel, others en
tertaining:, others numerous pictures,
books and bric-a-brac. One woman
who had paid little durinj? the contro
versy was at last addressed, and replied
by saying that she had not spoken be
fore as shqjinew nc-ne of these present
nrould agree with her.
"For." she said, flushing shyly, "my
desire would be for a large family of
children whom I could have finely edu
cated ard to whom I could give all the
advantcres I would want my boys and
girls to have."
Her remark was greeted with a mur
mur of surprise and dissent.
"Do you really mean that?" asked
one woman incredulously.
"Indeed, I do," was the calm reply.
"To my way of thinking there Js no
greater happiness than for a woman
to be surrounded by a number of chil
dren, witb the means to do them jus
tice."
Ah, there's the rub. Surely 'tis a pity
that the dollar mark must shine
through everything as it does, an ugly
birth scar on the face of nature.
In many case?, however, it is not the
tho-ught of the present expenses of
children, or the thought of what they
will cost during the first fosv years of
their life, that causes people to wish to
have small families. It is rather the
dread lest, when the young people are
old enough to enter college there will
not be the finances necessary to the
completion of their education. It would
be well for those who argue thus to
remember that in this country of ours
few people have, during the first years
of marriagp, the money that is theirs
twenty years later. Each of us knows
married couples who at 25 were poor,
and who at 50 are considered wealthy.
I have ir. mind one man and woman
who were bo poor during the first years
of their married life that the wife did
all her own work, including the washing
and ironing. Her husband is now worth
several milions. In their early mar
ried life they felt that they could af
ford but one child. He was born and
died. Now they look with envious
eyes at parents of large families. They
have the means, without which they
felt they should not have children. But
they have not the children.
I would not have any one imagine
that I would advocate the bringing
into the world more little ones
than one can. at the time,
feed and clothe. But I do
hold that when parents are abundantly
able to provide for their chil
dren during childhood, they make
a mistake in insisting that at birth
there must be on hand the money with
which to send the new-born baby
through college and set him up in the
business or profession he may choose.
A refutation of the theory that the
only reason that American parents
have small families is lack of funds
lies in the fact that it is the wealthy
and well-to-do parents who have few
children.
Let us look the matter plainly in the
face and announce that parents have
no more right to indulge in numbers
of children â crowding into the nursery
in swift succession, taking more
money than the parents .have, making
the payment of just debts impossible,
and sapping the courage of the father
and the strength of the mother
âthan they have to purchase houses
and lands for which they cannot pay.
But, when parents can buy luxuries
that are not necessities, and can in
dulge their personal whims and wishes,
surely children have a right to be.
To bear and rear children is one of the
chief aims of woman's existence, and
until she has borne a child she has
not lived up to the purpose of her
being, and hers is not a full, round
life.
The obstacle that stands in the way
of large families to-day is the bug
bear that we may as well call by its
right name â selfishness. And it is the
woman's selfishness. Surely. she
pleadsâ and with reason on her side
she is the one to be considered, as it
is upon her, not upon the husband,
that the burden of bearing, nursing
and caring for the children comes.
And the American husband, noted,
over the world for his consideration
for his wife's- wishes, declares that she
shall have her way in this matter.
Japanese Loyalty.
; Loyalty to country and Emperor is
instilled in the minds of the Japanese
I from infancy, and the principle of pa
triotism is the strongest motive power
in Japan to-day. It supersedes all oth
ers and amounts almost to fanaticism.
The next most prominent feature is re
j ppect for parents, teachers and those in
authority. The idea of the individual is
only slightly developed, and a man can
hardly be considered to have any ex
istence apart from his family and his
! country- i His duty to his wife and
children is nothing in comparison to his
duty to his parents; and, again, his
duty to his parents counts for nothing
as against his duty to the state and the
Emperor. Every public schoolboy goes
through a course of military drill, and
even young children are taught to sing
the modern songs of war and the old
I songs of loyalty. _
unique in American politics that a candidate for the
Presidency, a multimillionaire, has to establish his own
newspapers in which to announce his candidacy and
trumpet his merits. The party cannot escape him. It
may locate its convention in the Barcan desert, or where
rolls the Oregon, and Hearst will be there with a news
paper. He says now that Gorman,' Olney and Parker all
fea,r him and will join forces against him.
Surely if it were not for his candidacy and for the fact
that he deposits his newspapers as generally and as reck
lessly as a fly does specks much interest would be taken
out of the campaign. He announces with confidence that
he has already pledged the delegations from California,
Iowa, Michigan and New Jersey with a mortgage ready
to foreclose on several Southern States. Heretofore un
heard of but ambitious men are telling their friends that
they are staked out for places in his Cabinet, and some
believe that he has already the right to negotiate treaties
and send them to the Senate.
r
St. Sure Not Sure.
Ralph Hamlin. the man who has
turned the creaking old bridge that
connects Alameda City and Bay Farm
Islanfl for twenty years and let hun
dreds of boats in and out of San Lean
dro Bay, likes to tell how Fred St. Sure.
Alameda's former City Recorder,
once hoaxed half of Alameda County
with the biggest fish story ever told.
Judge St. Sure used to parcel out
news as well as justice while he was
on the bench, %nd five years ago acted
as correspondent for a San Francisco
paper. One day news was scarce, so
the Judge wrote a lurid account of an
extraordinary run of smelt into San
Leandro Bay. His imagination filled
the waters with such numbers of fish
that they clogged the wheels of the
drawbridge. Hamlin couldn't turn it
with a horse and two men. People
lined the shores, armed with pitch
forks and filled their wagons with
fish. It was slyly hinted that a sub
marine upheaval had caused this tre
mendous run.
"Well, say," Hamlin goes on to re
late, "when people read that yarn next
day they came to this bridge in droves
â hundreds. They came afoot and in
wagons from miles around. They
all brought lunches and most of them
babies. They had all kinds of fishing
tackle. Some brought pitchforks,
thinking the Judge's story true. I
sold out all my bait to the first three
men that came. I'll bet I could have
sold $100 worth, easy. Well, there
wasn't a fish caught that day. You
never saw a more disappointed crowd
in your life. But I told them all the
tide wasn't right and to come again.
I'll swear if people didn't keep com
ing every day for a week after that,
but none of them ever got more than
one or two shiners. As a matter of
fact there has never been a run of fish
into this bay since I've been here. It
was all the Judge's imagination."

The Palo Alto Times says that th3
Palo Alto Board of Trade Is preparing
for more extensive advertising of Palo
Alto. It continues:
"It has come to be thought a nec
essity that our promotion work should
deal largely with Stanford University
and its great architectural beauty and
superior educational advantages. This
institution is undoubtedly the greatest
factor in the growth of Palo Alto and
cannot be given too much prominence.
Yet we should not dwell upon this one
point to the exclusion of others, as has
been the tendency heretofore. While
none too much has-been said about
Stanford, too little has been said about

town is becoming important of itself
and has many features that will appeal
to people who may not be directly in
fluenced by educational matters. We
should dwell upon its desirability as a
place for. homes, as a place where'in
vestment In realty must increase in
value. We should show the equality of
climate, the natural healthful condi
tions, the beauty of scenery and many
other facts.. This should be done both
by well-selected views and pertinent
descriptive articles. We make these
suggestions without any purpose to
dictate to the committees having 'the
literature in preparation, but to em
phasize the necessity of having- the lit
erature so prepared that it will ac
complish the greatest possible good.
The pamphlets to be issued will have a
wide circulation and not only the first
edition of 5000, but many more thou
sands should be had in view in their
preparation."
There was a large attendance and re
newed interest was manifested in pub
lic improvements which the board has
in contemplation. Among these is an
effort to secure through Congressman
Metcalfe an appropriation by Congress
for the improvement of Suisun Slough
so that navigation by that waterway
will be greatly facilitated. A local com
pany owns a freight steamer which
plies between Suisun and San Francis
co, and nearly al the freight shipped to
and from Suisun in transported by their
steamer. In some places at low tide the
water is not of sufficient depth to float
the boat, which causes serious incon
venience to traffic. With the expendi
ture of about $20,000 the slough can be
dredged so as to be navigable at all
times, which will be of great benefit to
the business interests of Suisun and a
large surounding territory.
The Vallejo News gives an account of
a recent meeting of the Suisun Board of
Trade. The following officers were elect
ed: E. Dinkelspiel. president; J. Len
ahan, vice president; L. W. Taylor, sec
retary: A. Hilborn, treasurer; W. L.
Griffiths, J. T. Cooper and Lewis Pierce,
directors.
PROGRESSIVE SUISUN.
They may here see samples of our
oranges, of our olives, our deciduous
fruits, our cereals, view specimens from
our mines and gain within a few min
utes' time an excellent idea of what
we have. It takes time to gather a
good exhibit of this kind, and as our
office has been but recently opened, the
work has hardly more than been be
gun, but it is part of the general plan
of the Oroville Chamber of Commerce
to have on display here fair samples
of all our staple products and to use
our office to good advantage in im
pressing visitors with the fact that we
have a wonderful country here, -where
An office has been opened on a prin
cipal street in Oroville, where products
are placed on exhibition and where the
secretary can be found. Here visiting
tourists may be given literature de
scriptive of our county and its re
sources.
Oroville has had a Chamber of Com
merce for a number of years, but not
until about eight months ago did the
citizens of this place seem to awake
to a full realization of the importance
of such an organization and evince a
desire to make a concentrated move
ment forward on the lines of progress
set out by such an organization as we
now have.
The old Chamber of Commerce was
given new life at a banquet held last
May, at which were present the promi
nent business men of Oroville and
those living in and about here most
vitally interested in the welfare of the
town and surrounding country. Sup
port was pledged to the new organiza
tion, and W. A. Beard, now secretary
of the Sacramento Valley Development
Association, who was then editing the
Oroville Mercury, took the secretary
ship and retained active management
until he went to Sacramento to enter
upon his new duties. The resignation
of Mr. Beard and the necessary retire
ment of others who subsequently un
dertook the work retarded somewhat
the progress which it was expected
would be made, but Oroville is still
alive to the importance of the work
and there seems to be no reason why
a great deal should not be accom
plished through the organization.
PRODUCTS ARE EXHIBITED. .
resources are unbounded â where the
capitalist and the homeseeker can find
inviting fields.
The objects of the present Chamber
of Commerce are set out in its by
laws. They are to consider and dis
cuss subjects of vital interest to Oro
ville and Butte County; to encourage
enterprises calculated to increase the
prosperity and promote and protect the
industrial, commercial, manufacturing,
agricultural and mining interests; to
attract immigration by advertising the
varied resources of the county; to pro
mote the building of good county roads;
to promote the construction and exten
sion of canals for irrigation and drain-<
age; to promote the building and ex-<
tension of railroads, and to promote the
prosperity of Butte and other counties
of the Sacramento Valley through affil
iation with the Sacramento Valley De
velopment Association.
GOOD OPPORTUNITIES.
We believe that ours is a land of op
portunity such as is not readily found
elsewhere, but never have we taken
energetic steps to let the outside world
know what we have.
Oroville is situated where the valley
meets the mountain, at the foot of the
western slope of the Sierra Nevadas.
It receives its support through a great
diversity of Industries. Lumbering,
mining and stock-raising are carried
on" in the higher altitudes, fruit grow
ing is a leading industry in the foothill
section, and all of the products which
have made the Sacramento Valley fam
ous grow near at hand where the val
ley stretches away from the foothills.
Dredger mining, an industry which
has sprung up within the past five
years, has given the town a wonderful
impetus. Twenty-two of the giant
gold-finders are now at work taking
out the yellow metal, and many years
â probably a quarter of a century â
will have elapsed before the avallablo
tcround will have been worked. Some
valuable orchard land will of necessity
be sacrificed, but the quantity of good
land which will be destroyed is very
small and ntarly all of the work is con
fined to a district which was turned
topsy-turvy by Chinamen in the early
seventies.
MARK NEW ERA.
The coming of the dredger marked a
new era in Oroville's existence. The
town is built on a rich bed of aurifer
ous gravel and the big machines have
come close up to the town limits. They
would like to come inside, but they
can't, and Oroville will always remain
as she is now, the golden oranges above
the ground and the yellow metal below
the surface.
The shortest route from San Fran
cisco to the East lies through the
Feather River Canyon and Beckwith
Pass. A railroad following this
route must pass through Oroville. We
have reason to expect that the route
will bo taken advantage of in the
near future, when we will be in di
rect communication with the East,
and our Chamber of Commerce will
then be of additional advantage to
us. We have mines of value to be
opened up; forests of timber awaiting
the ax and mountain streams to be
harnessed for their power. Lands
can be obtained here cheaply which
will grow aimost anything.
The oranges which may be produced
are unexcelled in the world. Our
olives are so popular when pickled
that our packers cannot supply the de
mand; deciduous fruits grow luxu
riously, and our grain farms are of the
best. Water for irrigation is unlim
ited in supply. It seems to us that
there is so much to atract the atten
tion of the capitalist and the home
seeker here that all that is necessary
to build up our country and better our
condition is to keep awake and make
an organized effort to let the people
know what we have.
Our efforts will not be confined to
advancing the interests of Oroville
alone. The county and the Sacramen
to Valley will receive attention from
us, and we are now circulating Butte
County pamphlets and Sacramento
Valley literature from our office.
Those who belong to our associa
tion pay one dollar a month toward
its support. The board, of directors
are eight in number: C. L. Bills, R. S.
Powers, L. M. Alexander, E. Tucker,
M. Reyman. Warren Sexton, W. T.
Henn and R. M. Green. Mr. Bills is
president. The directors meet month
ly and the organization as a whole,
annually.
A Chamber of Commerce or like'or
ganization is almost a necessity in
this day of advancement. With a
good substantial organization of this
kind we are moving forward in the
line of general progress â without it
we would be lagging behind and miss
ing the good things that would go to
our more enterprising neighbors.
It is proposed to build a dam sixty
feet high at the foot of Bald Rock
Canyon on the Middle Fork of Feather
River and take the water out by a ditch
on the Moorctown Ridge on the line of
the Smith survey. There will be a fall
of â¬00 feet, generating the great quan
tity of electrical power equal to 20,000
horsepower. A power station will be
established on the South Fork just be
low Bidwell Bar. From here the power
will be taken to San Francisco and
other points, via Oroville.
A portion of the water will be carried
across the South Fork in a syphon and
emptied into the Palermo ditch, which
will be enlarged to carry the increased
volume of water. This will be finished
to parties along the line from Biuwell
Bar to OroVille, inclusive, for Irrigating
and mining purposes.
On November 30, 3903. John C. Boyle
located 15,000 inches of water of the

"This outline of the location, area
and climate of Sonoma County makes
it unnecessary to go into details of
thi". that or the other product. Given
a fertile soil, abundant rainfall, no ex
treme of heat or cold, and deductions
present themselves with mathematical
certainty. But if an object lesson is
preferred, the green hills, golden pop
pies, ripe oranges and blooming roses
of February, the mythological month
of fecundation, will furnish it for the
most skeptical."
"The cultivation of the olive and
manufacture of its products is an in
creasing industry in Sonoma County.
It has one hundred thousand trees,
mostly in bearing. Olive oil made in
Sonoma County took a gold medal at
the Paris Exposition and the first
prize at the World's Fair at Chicago.
It took thirty years for the Califor
nians to 'learn the art of making and
ripening wine. It may take some
time to learn how to make olive oil
at a price which will compete with
the cheaper manufacture of Europe,
but American ingenuity will in the
end accomplish it. The export of
olive oil from Sonoma will then be
among its largest products.
"There is a considerable quicksilver
produetitm in Sonoma. One mine

"One of the most profitable indus
tries in Sonoma County is poultry
raising. It yields a product of $2,000,

on the nail every day for the amount
sold.
Among the latter the more noted are
the Geysers, Lytton and Taylor's White
Sulphur Springs, near Santa Rosa.

features of the county is the canyon

"The bulk of the advertising done
has been by means of the Gateway
magazine. Postal cards stating that
the magazl-e will be mailed to any
address upon receipt of four cents in
postage have been sent to all names
and addresses of persons who have
signified a desire to come to California.
During the year 2050 of these people
have written to the Chamber of Com
merce inclosing PL-stage and have re
ceived the Gateway magazine.
"Other copies of the Gateway maga
zine to the number of about 2000 have
been distributed by the California Pro
motion Committee, the State poard of
Trade and the Southern Pacific Infor
mation Bureau. More important than
these distributions, however, has been
the distribution on the part of the
Santa Fe railroad of 25.000 copies of the
Gateway magazine, which it printed
and circulated at its own expense.
"In aditlon to- the Gateway magazine
the Chamber has distributed 10,000
pamphlets in the form of catechisms
regarding the products and industries
of Stockton and San Joaquin county;
3000 illustrated cards; 2000 copies of a
very creditable annual edition of the
Daily Independent. This makes a total
distribution of literature during the
year of 44,000 pieces. The total cost to
the Chamber for .printing has been $33.
"Exhibits of the products of the
county have been maintained during
the year at the State Board Of Trade
rooms in San Francisco and at the local
headquarters in StocKton. According
to a reDort from the manager of the
State Board of .Trade 24,475 people have
viewed the exhibit at that place. The
xeffister at local headquarters shows
President Steinbeck reviewed the ef
forts of the Chamber of Commerce to
prevent the diversion of the waters of
the Sacramento River into the San Joa
quin River by means of a cut through
Sherman Island. A strong delegation
from the chamber attended the conven
tion in San Francisco concerning the
river interest, and "the large delega
tion so dominated the meeting that the
friends of the Sherman Island cut-off
deemed It expedient to adjourn the con
vention without attempting to procure
the indorsement they wished."
The chamber also appointed a com
mittee of five to go to Sacramento to
oppose the passage of a bill to effect
the diversion of the Sacramento River
waters Into the San Joaquin. The com
mittee secured the desired amendment
to the bill before the Legislature. The
committee also had a Stockton man
appointed on the auditing board.
Among the other things accomplished
by the Stockton Chamber of Commerce
in 1903. President Steinbeck reported
that an amendment to the State law
regulating the awarding of contracts
for municipal lighting was secured, and
that the amendment rendered it possible
to make contracts for municipal light
ing for any term not to exceed four
years. The amendment <of the law
opened the doors for competition.
In November last the chamber took
part in the celebration at Manteca in
honor of the completion of an irrigation
system in Southern San Joaquin Coun
ty. The chamber lent active aid to the
Western Pacific Railway in its efforts
to obtain franchises within the city of
Stockton; it entertained a party of Ger
man agriculturists who came to Inquire
into the resources of the State; it sent
special representatives to the Trans-
Mississippi Congress at Seattle and the
National Irrigation Congress at Ogden.
A resolution was secured setting forth
to the Congress of the United States
the needs of the San Joaquin River.
Concerning the work of advertising,
there was matter of special interest in
the president's address as follows:
ADVERTISES LARGELY.
W. P. Steinbeck, president of the
Stockton Chamber of Commerce, at the
annual meeting of the chamber deliv
ered an annual address, in the course
of which he told of the work of the
organization during the year 1903. The
chamber supported a nlan to divert the
flood waters of Mormon channel into
the Calaverag River. It was necessary
to raise $60,000 to pay for the rights of
way for the canal and for land required
for the canal. A bill was drawn by the
chamber calling for an appropriation of
$60,000, and this was passed by the Cal
ifornia Legislature. After the bill was
passed the committee which had been
instrumental in securing favorable con
sideration for it worked to secure
rights of way. -With few exceptions the
owners of property along the line of the
canal have promised to accept the
amounts offered in payment for their
land. Work on the canal will probably
be completed this year.
In May, 1903, so reported President
Steinbeck, the electors of Stockton
voted overwhelmingly in favor of bond
ing the city in the sum of $160,000 for
the construction of a municipal electric
lighting plant, thereby placing their in
dorsement upon the efforts of the
Chamber of Commerce to obtain such a
plant.

Steinbeck Reviews Events
in Which Stockton
Is Concerned.
"Tho population of the county is 40.
000, mostly engaged in agricultural pur
suits. Its assessed wealth is $27,000,000.
Its annual production of wealth from
the soil is $7,500,000. This is $175 per
capita for every inhabitant, including
women, children and all other non-pro
ducersâor. to put it another way, it is
5900 a year for every registered voter
in the county.
"On the coast south of the Gold Ridge
country there if? a district of low, roll
ing hills, o^-n to the sea, bare of trees
and covered with a rich sward of na
tive grass, green or nearly so the year
around. Some of the largest creameries
and dairy farms in the State arc situ
ated in this idf-al dairy country.
"Sonoma :s a well-watered county.
Through all ite valleys there arc run
ning streams proportioned in volume to
the catchment which supplies them.
Russian River, the largest in the coun
ty, enters it from Mendocino. flows
southwesterly for twenty miles, turns
west and finds its way to the Pacific
Ocean through a depresion in "the
Coast Range. The streams of the small
valleys for twenty miles north and an
equal distance south flow into and
through its channel to the sea. Except
ing Petaiums, Sonoma and the Gualala
valleys it drains the entire county.
There are innumerable'pnringF of fresh
and mineral water in the county.
Secretary A. S. Luce of the Sonoma
County Board of Trade supplies pome
valuable information about Sonoma
County that is up to date. Some of his
statements are as follows:
IN RICH SONOMA COUNTY.
"There are many towns in the county
that are thriving and increasing. San
ger has a population of 1500 and is a
center for grain, alfalfa, hay, lumber,
oranges and wine. The last season
2200 carloads of lumber and millwork
were shipped, and the winery crushed
about 1100 tons of grapes. Reedley has
a. population of about 200. but the post
office reaches over 1500 persons. It is
a large wheat and vineyard center.
Selma is another of the more impor
tant towns. Fowler is the center of a
largf ra'.fin producing district, and also
has the lars^st olive oil works in the
county. Clovis is an important lumber
r-enter, and Laton is situated in a very
fertile district, which is bring rapidly
developed.
There are about 625 miles of main
irrigation canals, covering 350,000 acres
cf land on the Kings River delta. The
combined capacity of the canals lead
ing out of Kings River is 4000 cubic
feet per second. The lumber produced
in Fresno County in 1303 is estimated
to be worth $1,200,000. The quantity
was 60.000.000 feet. The total value of
minerals produced in 1902 was $670,058.
The county is rich In minerals, but
little has been done to develop the min
eral industry. The largest mineral in
dustry in Fresno County at this time
is fcruad in the production of petro
leum. The petroleum output In 1902
was 571,223 barrels.
Fresno County contains many flour
ishing manufacturing establishments,
apart from those connected with the
lumber industry, the capital of which
in 19^0 was upward of six million dol
lars. Besides agricultural implement
works, and a large by-product factory,
there are soap works, brewery, ice
plants, creameries, flour mills and
many others.
At the last census Fresno city had
12.470 inhabitants and the county had
37.662. The area of the county is 5940
rquare miles. The present population
<>f the county is estimated to be 42,760.
The greatest number of land holdings,
*o Mr. Robertson reports, are in farms
from ten to twenty and up to fifty
acres. "There is a mistaken idea that
farms and vineyards are all on a large
scale, but this is no longer the case,"
say* Mr. Robertson.
INCREASE IN PRODUCTS.
An extract is made from Mr. Robert
ton's report relative to the increase in
farm production in Fresno county dur
ir.p tlie last six years:
"The increase in production in or
chard fruits, grapes, cereals and cattle
durir.p: the last Fix years i; very re
markable. According: to the Assessor's
returns. v,hi<h will answer the purpose
for comparison, although as already
stated, much below the actual figures,
we find that the number of fig- trees
has increased by 24.755: olives, 20,113;
peaches. 14S.311; oranges and lemons,
KkCM: but pears, owing to the blight,
have fallen off in number by 17,155.
"The figures for grapes are remark
able in more ways than one. The in
crease la table prapes is 673 acres, in
raisin graphs, 7910 acres, and in wine
grapes L'7.4^3 acres; the latter increase
is very striking. The total increase in
six rears Is therefore 36.076 acres.
"Comnared with the acreage in 1902,
there has been an increase of 216 acres
during the past yÂ«ar.
""In cereals and forage, there is a
l'alljng off in the acreage in wheat of
-4. $26 acres, in barley of 9729 acres,
and of D240 tons of hay. This fallin?
off is explained by the fact that the
fruit cultivation is taking the place
of grain.
"In stock cattle the number has just
doubled, there being an increase of 15,
807. Cows have increased no less than
46.671: horses show a falling off of 2232
in number, and sheep and lambs are
also fewer by 25S.256."
Mr. Robertson also reports that figs
and oranges are cultivated with great
success, that there are 7S.S72 acres in
grapes; that the fruit and nut trees
in the county number 947,408; that there
are 111 acres in small fruits; that Fres
no County is sixth among California
counties in the dairy industry: that
during the last two years the raisin
production of Fresno County was more
than 100.000,000 pounds, a four-fold in
crease: that Fresno city i= the center
of the seeded raisin industry of the
United States; that the total capacity
of the wineries in Fresno County is
about 12.000,000 gallons and the distill
eries of the county have a capacity of
5.000,000 proof gallons.
I RR IG ATI N'G CA SAUB.
George Robertson, statistician <>f the
FYo^nn Chamber of Commerce, has
compiled for the Fresno Republican a
general review concerning Fresno city
and Fresno County. From this it ap
pears thai Fresno County has a grand
value of all property of $34,332,205. This
shows an increase in six years of 55.
Â£â¢66,427. omitting railway property. The
funded debt of the county is but 180,000,
which is the total county indebtedness,
there being n<Â» floating debt. The total
value fif the property Â«>f the county is
exceeded in the State, omitting San
Francisco and Los Angeles, by only
Alameda. Sacramento, Banta Clara and
tian Joaquin counties. In values Fres
no end San Joaquin counties, as shown
by the returns, are not far apart.
"During three months in th*> pprins?
of this year, when colonist rates from
the East were in effect, the Chamber
maintained a special representative at
the State Board of Trade rooms. A
special fund was raised to meet this
expense, and the amount raised was
$38 65 in excess of the cost.
"The work of preparing an exhibit
for display at the Louisiana Purch.iss
Exposition which is to open at St.
Louis. Missouri, in May. has been left
to a joint county commission com
posed of members of the Board of
Supervisors and representatives of the
Chamber of Commerce. The commis
sion has had a man in the field gath
ering material, and has been actively
engaged in the work of preparation
for the past six months. The ex
pense has been borne by the Board of
Supervisors and it is the hope of the
commission that the money now on
hand in the special county funds, to
gether with what can yet be appropri
ated, will be sufficient to carry out
the work as planned. If this hope is
fulfilled there seems to be no reason
why San Joaquin County should not
have one of the most attractive and
comprehensive county exhibits on dis
play at St. Louis.
"The Chamber of Commerce began
the year 1903 with a debt of $1105 57.
and it was feared by some that thÂ«
effort to pay this debt while meeting
the current expenses of the year
would injure the efficiency of the
chamber. Such has not proved to be
the case. The chamber has not only
paid all current expenses while con
ducting a successful campaign for a
municipal electric Jight plant, divert
ing canal and other matters spoken
of in his report, but it has paid off
its debt and begins the year with
$254 07 and a monthly income of
$467 to its credit."*
"In addition to the exhibits men
tioned. th3 Chamber made a display
of San Joaquin County products at thtÂ»
State Fair in Sacramento in Septem
ber. Owing to an arrangement made
with a citizens' committee at Sacra
mento the Chamber received $500 for
making this exhibit. The total cost
of making the display was $531 90.
The cost to the Chamber was there
fore hut $31 90. and in return for thi*
the Chamber came into possession of
exhibit material of the estimated
value of $250.
MAKE OTHER DISPLAYS.
1373 names for the year, of which 474
were from the Kast. AsÂ» only about
one in five register it is conservative
to say that 6S00 people have visited the
local headquarters during the year and.
that 2370 of these were Easterners.
During the year the local exhibit has
been enlarged and improved until it 13
believed to be the most attractive and
complete exhibit of county products

The American ship Astral, Captain Dunham,
was towed Into Beale , street dock yesterday.
Although she is loaded with 5000 tons of coal
?she is the cleanest and freshest vessel that
ever came into this port. Her attractive ap
pearance was the subject of much compli
mentary notice from passers-by who Â¦Â¦ were
strolling along the docks yesterday. '';Â¦:: Â¦ Â¦. Â¦â¢
Astral Docks.
Peterson's refitted launch Amy, which was
launched on Saturday, had her trial run yes
terday. Her new engines, which were built
by Frank Peters on the dock, proved to do
all that was claimed for them. She ran up
to Hunters Point and back and scored ten
and one-half knots, which is equal to about
thirteen miles. This Is fine time for so small
a boat and makes her one of the fastest on
the bay. , * j
She has been refitted throughout and painted
and presents a first-class appearance.
Launch Makes Fast Time.
The bay was smooth and calm, and many
took advantage to go out in launches, while
the unusual sight of families in small rowboats
was a novil one .
The street fakirs were in . much evidence,
their being no less than a dozen vending
their wares and goods, which included pretty
much everything from religious tracts to shav
ing soao. Slnjring of Salvationists also added
to the general excitement of the day.
Altogether, so far' as the concourse of
sightseers was concerned. It was the liveliest
day that has been _ een along the docks for
many years.
The main attractive feature, of course, was
the Herzo_ln Cecilie: then there* was the
great Norwegian steamship Titania discharg
ing her cargo of 5507 tons of coal, part going
on to the coal dock at Howard wharf and the
balance on to the old coal hulk Melrose.
The fine weather of yesterday attracted great
crowds to the. water front, and from thÂ» Mail
dock to the ferry *depot thousands of people
sauntered along, taking in the different sights.
There was plenty to see to amuse and lntenst.
Fine Day on Watffr Front.

The cadet school ship Herzogin
Cecille was the center of attraction on
the water front yesterday. Captain M.
Dietrich had sent out several thousand
cards of admission to the ship, and
they were practically all acknowledged
In person. From 11 a. m. until nearly
dusk the ship was thronged with
crowds of interested sightseers, who
roamed around from stem to stern, and
from deck to hold at their own free
will. At times the decks were so
crowded that navigation was almost
impossible and finally, about 2 o'clock,
the jam became so great that for a
time it became necessary to refuse ad/
mittance. A great crowd collected In
the meantime, which completely filled
the dock from East street to the end
of the wharf. ,On board the vessel the
officers and the sixty-seven cadets en
tertained their visitors to the best of
their ability. A few spoke English, a
small number knew a few words of the
language, while the majority were only
conversant with their native tongue.
Conse cuently when It <iame to de
scribing the different workings of the
machinery of the vessel* conversation
ceased to be of use, and the language
of signs was introduced and_ carried on
with great vigor. The majority of the
visitors were ladies. They were very
smartly dressed in light colored fabrics,
and East street never before* put on
such a festive appearance.
The vessel will probably remain here
two weeks longer. She is not under
charter as yet, so her next objective
point is unknown.

for Hongkong via Honolulu.

ST. LOUIS, Jan. 24.â The Louisiana
Purchase Exhibition stands ready and
is waiting' for the general installation
of exhibits. The point has been reached
where the management of the exposi
tion is . no longer . occupied with the
rapid advancement toward completion
of the buildings, but instead it now
lays particular stress upon the import
ance of the speedy shipment of exhibits,
especially those assembled by domestic
exhibitors. Officials of the exposition
make the statement that the one thing
of paramount importance to insure the
anticipated successful and auspicious
opening of the World's Fair is the Im
mediate commencement by domestic
exhibitors to ship cars as rapidly as
can be had. Â»'
Owing to the unprecedented partici
pation by both foreign and domestic
exhibitors, vast numbers of exhibits
have been and are now in course of
arrangement and collection. The time
for the opening of the exposition is
rapidly approaching, but apparently
the knowledge of the fact is not causing
the shipment of exhibits to be rushed
forward with the promptness and dis
patch that is absolutely essential to
insure rapid delivery of. the cars to the
World's Fair site and to avoid possible
congestion in the handling of the cars
after they have reached St. Louis.
The World's Fair management has
devoted more than ordinary attention
to preparation for the handling of cars,
and the arrangements are now com
pleted. Adequate railroad facilities are
ready, the warehouses have all been
erected and all the buildings are, in such
a state of completion that Installation
of exhibits can be commenced imme
diately.
What the management now most ar
dently desires is the prompt shipment
of exhibits from the different parts of
the country to begin immediately.
Otherwise, if there be delay, congestion
in- traffic handling after St. Louis is
reached is almost an assured condition.
It is estimated that from 25,000 to
30,000 cars of domestic exhibits alone
will reach St. Louis during the last uf
March and the fore. part of April. As
the World's Fair opens on April 30. it
is said it will be difficult to handle thid
enormous influx of freight at the last
moment.

RIVERSIDE, Jan. 24. - Anothern N.
Rockhill was found n*~ ":red to-night
by his nephew, Harry Beatty, at his
hpme on Monroe street. When Beatty
entered the house he found the body
of Rockhiil with a trunk strap fastened
about the neck and the side of the head
either kicked or beaten in.
The rifled trunks and other evidences
indicate robbery as a motive for the
crime. The only clew is a one-cent
Mexican coin, suggesting that the mur
derer may have been a Mexican.
Rockhill was one of the oldest resi
dents of this valley, having come here
over thirty years ago. He was 71 years
old.
The demands of the league formu
lated to-day in substance contemplate
self-government in all essential par
ticulars, through the medium of a Pa
cific advisory board, which the Ameri
can Kennel Club now maintains on
this coast, but which, it is claimed, is
a mere figurehead, with no authority
to modify existing rules to conform" to
Pacific Coast conditions. The delegates
express slight hope that the New York
club will grant the de
manded. It was determined that, In the
event of the American Kennel Club re
jecting the demands made upon it, all
Northwestern clubs combine to aid the
California members of the league, both
with entries and, if need be, with
money, to the en dthat it may success
fully combat with the American Kennel
Club in that State.
The matter of the- establishment of a
studbook for the registration of Pacific
Coast animals was discussed, but
action Was deferred In deference to the
wishes of the California clubs who de
sire to investigate the advisability of
this step before casting their votes, in
favor of the move.

became Grand Vizier in 1898 and held

Following his deposition the ex-
Grand Vizier departed from Teheran
for a two years' tour of the workJ, to in
clude a pilgrimage to Mecca. It was

DIXON. Jan. 24.â The twenty-dog
stake promoted by the Dixon Coursing
Club to-day proved a successful affair.
The hares were a strong lot and ex
citing coursing resulted. The stake

ed Regal Attire in the deciding

Hot Time beat Black Bess, The Abbot beat
Knob Hill. Constable Jack beat Driftwood,
Friendless Boy b<--at Matipan, Kitty Van beat

Sixth roundâ Palo Alto beat Bill Dugan, 7-4;
Â¦RaKtime a bye!
Deciding course â Palo Alto withdrawn. Rag
time wins by default.
Ragtime, P. J. Horgan's game grey
hound, carried off all the glory yester
day afternoon at Union Coursing Park.
The open stake went to him by default,
as Palo Alto was withdrawn at the last
moment, having exhausted his strength
in a whirlwind course against Bill Du
gan in the sixth round.
The day was an' ideal one for the
sport and the largest crown in many
months was at hand to watch 'em run.
Betting was lively and the shortenders"
were there with many courses, the up
sets coming "at short intervals and tak
ing the wise ones completely by sur
prise.
Ragtime had an easy time of it down
to the deciding course. He beat Mc-
Henry's Cubanola, Miss Green, Adver
tiser and Fair Tralee by default.
Strange as it may seem, he was always
led by the opposing dog, and on several
occasions he seemed out of the running,
yet he always came through strongly
at the finish and won out by many
points. Bill Dugan was the reverse.
He led Palo Alto for a fare ye well in
the sixth round and all but won out,
but his famous opponent made up for
lost time near the finish and made
away with the glory.

PRINCE BECOMES
GRAND VIZIER
The Independents defeated the Oc
cidentals in a game of association
football at the Presidio Athletic
grounds yesterday afternoon by a
score of 5 to 0. During the first half
the Independents practically had
everything their own way, the Occi
dentals only securing two trials at the
goal "wTHle the- Independents had four
teen. The first half ended with the
score standing 4. to 0 in favor of the
Independents.
Thi9 showing spurred the Occident
als to greater effort and in the second
half they did some splendid work.
One of the prettiest plays of the game
was made in the second half, when a
penalty kick of the Occidentals was
saved by the clever work of Forbes,
goal-keeper for the Independents. The
line-up was as follows:
Independents. Â¦ Position. Occidentals.

Yesterday morning at Idora Park.
Oakland, six men of the Oakland Hor
nets' second eleven beat an eleven of
the Hospital Corps of Alameda 3 goals
to 2.
In the first period the Thistles. Dlay
ing with the sun in their faces, had
the best of the game, repeatedly putt
ing the Vampire goal in danger. Near
the end of the first half the Thistles
scored a goal, Airth saving at first, but
the ball rebounding off Lyndon and
going into the net.
In the second 'half the Vampires
played a faster game and kept the ball
in the Thistles' territory a good part
of the time. At last Lees centered the
ball and Wilding put it through. The
score was tied and the Vampire sup
porters â¢ were wildly enthusiastic.
Neither side scored again and the
match ended in a tie. The team work
of the Thistles was, as usual, excel
lent and every man in the eleven
played well.. The Vampires worked
hard, Petersen rendering the greatest
service at back. Harwood being con
spicuous in the half-back line and
Showell and Buchly on' the forward
line. The result of the match makes
it almost certain that the Thistles will
win the championship of the Califor
nia League this season. Arthur Rob
inson was referee, giving general sat
isfaction by the promptness and cor
rectness of his decisions. The teams
lined up in the following positions:
Thistles Positions. Vampires.
Lowe Goalkeeper Airth
Tiernoy Left Back Petersen
Forrest Right Back Theberge
Taylor Left Half Back Harwood
Duncan Center Half Back Turner
McGregor Rijtht Half Back Glarner

;The tennis players took advantage of
they warm .weather yesterday and the
courts were crowded from morning un
til night. The feature on fhe California
Club courts was the match between
Clarence Griffin of the Golden Gate
Qlyb and Herbert Schmidt of the Cali
fornia Ciub; ;
The Hever little player from the park
took. the club man, into camp, winning
three sets out of four. Griflln played
a good game throughout, but his oppo
nent was decidedly off in l;;s game. His
net work was poor and. In the back
court he played his oldrtime careless
game. The first two sets were close
and interesting, but th. last two were
one-sided. V â¢ . <
Schmidt played /well in the second iet,
the one he won, but was outplayed in
the other three. /A returp match will
be played on the park 'courts. 'â¢ The
"score iin Griffin's favor was 6â4, 3tâ 6,
6â2, .6â3.'. â¢: â¢ Â¦ .^- -Â¦â¢ /. >
The handicap doubles tournament
.commenced three, weeks, ago on the

A. Brabant. and. H. Palmer, two'n^W
comers at the park, carried off the
honors. They beat Horace 'Mann and
G. W. Finch in the finals, which, were
close.. The' losers received the trifling
handicap of "1-6," i which cut no figure
in*. the outcome. Brabant. and Palmer
won three sets out of four.
' J. A. Cole" and â¢ Norman Ambrose
reached the semi-finals in the^ upper
half and Harold -Grabriel' and Robert
Drolla in the lower. The latter, made
an excellent showing considering they
were allowed but "1-6" in each of their
matches. ; Code and Ambrose received
"1-6" from the Hotchkiss brothers and
won The. winners, were, .beat.en in
straight' sets by Brabant and Palmer,
who. gave" odds of "1^6." The winners
play an. awkward, game, but. it proved
effective. Palmer plays entirely on the
back court and his great reach enables
him to get nearly everything. The tour
nament matches resulted as -follows:
Code and Ambrose (1-0) beat, the Hotchkiss
brothers. ' 0-3, C-4; Gabriel and Drolla <l-Â«)

Frank Stringham and Sidney Salisbury
surprised everybody by beating Drum
mond MacGavin and Frank Mitchell
three sets out of five.
Joseph Tobin was in good form. He
played tie games with W. S. MacGavin
and with Grant Smith. Tobin is play
ing a better game than ever before.
Ray Cornell Is improving rapidly and
in future will be a hard man for second
class players to beat. He won three
sets from Harry Rolfe with ease. Rolfe
redeemed himself by beating Norman
Ambrose of the Golden Gate Club two
sets out of three. ., â¢
G. W. Burnett and Gus Lisser' played

"No advance on beef is contemplated,
as the market is well supplied owing to
dealers desiring to get rid of their stock
in order to save the cost of feed.
Whether beef will go up in price is
problematical."
The lack of-rain and the scarcity of
feed are the reasons for a rise in the
price of mutton, which will go into ef
fect in the butcher shops this morning.
One cent per pound will be added to the
price of mutton, a similar raise having
gone into effect last Monday. No ad
vance will be made in the price of beef.
F. Patek of Patek & Co., wholesale
butchers, in speaking of the rise in
prices said:
"Mutton is scarce in California owing
to the lack of rain and the loss of feed,
have been brought from other
States, some from Eastern Utah. The
freight of $1 15 a head for sheep is
equivalent to 2 cents a pound, and this
advance has been added to the retail
price. . â¢

Hulsworth was a native of England.
a plasterer by occupation, 21 years of
age .ind resided with his brother and
sister-in-law at 1027A Alabama street.
O'Brien was a native of this city. 22
years old and lived "with his parents at
242 Harriet street.
A Coroner's jury was formed and an
inquest held on tho remains of the two
men. The jury brought in a verdict
of accidental death, due to drowning.
The bodies of botli men were removed
to a local undertaking establishment.
A search was immediately institu
ted for the bodies of the two drowned
men. The corpse of O'Brien was
foui;<i r.fier a few minutes, but the
searchers did not discover Hulsworth's
body for an hour. It was found bur
ied In the mud in the bottom of the
stream.
Hulsworth. who w.".s sitting in the
stern, made a rush for the bow, and
in so doing capsized the frail skiff.
The four occupants were thrown into
the water and the boat filled quickly
and sank before they had a chance to
grab hold of it.
Kerr could swim, but the other
thref* were helpless. Bryan managed
to paddle about and was sinking for
lhe third and last time, when E. J.
Hulsworth. brother of one of th*
drowned men. arrived In a boat and
picked m> him and Kerr. Bryan was
exhauster! and did not recover from,
the effects of tho submerging for an
hour after his rescue.
The four young men started out in
the channel to fisb a few minutes be
fore 5 o'clock. None of the party
knew much about handling a boat,
and when the craft bogiin to leak as
soon as they reached the middle or
the stream they became excited and
lost their head?.
Harry E. Hulsworth and Harry
O'Brien, two young mechanics of this
city, were drowned in the channel op
posite the Jupiter Steel Works near
Baden shortly before 5 o'clock yester
day afternoon. The unfortunate men
were fishing: in a small boat at the
time in company with Jbhn Kerr and
William Bryan. The boat began to
leak and in his anxiety to escape Huls
worth capsized the frail craft. The
four occupants tver* thrown into the
water and O'Brien and Hulsworth
were drowned before aid reached
them.
There were many ej*e witnesses to
the tragedv, including Hulsworth's
brother and the la'ter's -wife. As soon
as the boat capsized several men
started from the chore in small skiffs
to the rescue. They succeeded in
saving Kerr and Bryan; who was going
down for Lhe third time, but the other
two had disappea* - ed under the water.
Their bodies were recovered soon after
the accident.

The woman lives at 637 PoÂ«tt strs't
with a man who, phe save, is her hus

the rjolice that he thought his wife was
employed as a waitress in a restau
rant on Washington street.
Detectives Bunner and Freel were
detailed on the case. Both the woman
and Dargal refused to say anything to
them as to the cause of the stabbing.
Yesterday afternoon they again saw
Dargal and he made a statement that
when he entered the woman's room
another man came in and stabbed her
and when he tried to interfere the man
stabbed him.
The officers then went to St. Thomas'
Hospital, where the woman made a
statement. She was very low and was
scarcely able to ! speak. She said she
was sitting in a chair, counting" her
money, when Dargal* opened the door
and spoke pleasantly to her. Without
giving her- any idea of his purpose, ho
leaned over her and thrust the Jtnifo
into her left breast. He placed his hand
over her mouth and, as he drew back
his hand to stab her again, she sum
moned all her strength and pushed him
away. He fell to the floor and she
screamed for help. ShÂ« saw the crowd
come into her room and Daryal stab
himself and throw the knifo at the
special officr. She said she had never
seen Dargal before, and was satisfied
that he intended to murder and rob
her.
DARGAI/S RAD RECORD.
William Dargal, formerly a member
of the Sixth Cavalry, entered the room
of Lizzie Kazlansky at 1129 Dupont
street early yesterday morning and
found her counting her money. His
cupidity^was aroused to such an extent
by the sight of the coin that he resolved
to murder her for it. Drawing a knife,
he plunged it into the woman's left
breast. He raised the bloody Aveaou'i
to strike again, but she pushed him
away with all her strength and he
slipped and fell to the floor. Ths
woman's screams were heard by Spe
cial Officer Lance and others and they
ran to the room, just as Dargal was
rising from the floor. Dargal, seeing
he could not escape, stabbed himsei'
three times in the left breast and threw
the bloodstained knife at Lance.

AS *e expected, a large crowd thronged i
the office of the Examiner all. day
Saturday. January "3. to obtain Mun-
yon's Paw Paw Remedy. Among the
crowd were some of our best-knoxvn oltl- J
zens â half a deeen doctors obtained a
bottle. One of them volunteered the re- '
mark that he had heard of the curative
oualitles of the remedy and would give
it a thorough trial. One of our leading
lawyers took a dose before he !eft the
Â»Â»fl5Â«"e and said thnt "he expected now to i
live as long as ilethuselah did." Most I
people seem to have an abiding faith in j
this remedy, believing they art going to I
be cured.
One old gentleman said that he be-
lieved in Munyon and in ilunyon's Rem- ]
edy, that Munyon's Rheumatism Cure i
had cared him of a chronic case of j
Rheumatism tbat afflicted him for more j
than fifteen years.
Another gentleman said if this remedy
la as good as his Kidney Cure it should
find its way into every home la * San
Francisco, as Munyon's Kidney Cure ha.i
cured him of a bad case of Kidney ail-
xn<.-nt.
Th* professor would possibly have felt Â¦
a little a hashed could lie have heard the
warm rraiBCS that a well-dressed l*dy
â¢ howtrw] upon his family remedies:, j
which rhe said the kept continually in i
the Itousfc.
The crowd was so great at times that '
the. attendant was u:iable to hand out '
the bottles fast enough, and one or two
bystanders v.ere called in to aid him.
TVc hope that every person who suf-
fers Â¦with dyspepsia, catarrh, or has any-
thing the matter with his stomach, or
Â¦uy one who is nervous or cannot sleep,
obtained a bottle before lh-i free saia-
(ica xrtrs all gone.
We would say to those *'io were un-
f ble to call for this free sample that
this remedy is for sale in all the drug
etores throughout the State.
