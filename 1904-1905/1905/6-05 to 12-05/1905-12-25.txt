crash of the two collisions were al
most simultaneous. Breaking glass,
cries of the injured and a dense cloud
of dust which for a time obscured thÂ»
scene, created almost a panic on the
crowded streets. In a minute thou
saniis of people- gathered around the
wreck. Scores of policemen were oa

.with one end against the curbing, were
taken out with difficulty. As fast a3
they were removed the most seriously
hurt were taken to the Receiving Hos

from slight cuts and brui3es were
treated .at Dean's drugstore, a few
feet distant from the wreck.
Many of those <who were shocked

of the Pacific Electric Railway half-way
between Los Angeles and that city, and
under cover of drawn revolvers went
through the pockets of the twenty-seven
passengers. With the loot stuffed into
their pockets and having previously com
pelled the motorman to slow down the
car, they dropped off beside the track Just
outride the city limits of Pasadena and
made their escape.
None of the passengers were armed and
no one made any resistance. Aside from
a number of watches and small change
the haul of the robbers was not more
than $100.
They boarded the car at the Southern
Pacific crossing just outside of Los An
gelea, one on .the front platform with
the motorman and the other with the
conductor in the rear of, the car. Imme
diately after paying their fare the holdup
ahead clapped a revolver, under the nose
of the motorman and compelled him to
slow down, while at the same time the

GREAT MASS OF TROOPS
YET TO CAST THE DIE
Revolutionists Must rail Unless They
Succeed in Winning the Military.
Government Will Proceed 'to Crush Out
Revolt With Merciless Vigor.
ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 24/ 8:30.p. m.â
With Moscow's baptism of blood the rev
olutionaries made good their threat to
transform the strike into armed rebellion,
and the next forty-eight hours should
determine whether they can marshal suf
ficient strength ' to plunge the country
into an actual state of civij war and seri
ously threaten the immediate downfall of
the Government. â¢ . ;
The. Government professes confidence
that the whole attempt .will fail owing to
the woeful insufficiency of arms In pos
session of the proletariat and by reason
of the loyalty of the briny. 'as 'a whole,
but its calculations might again be rudely
upset. A 'few might be seized to
furnish arms, or the ; open support of .a
few regiments might ; start a landslide in
the army. Certainly the shrewdest of the
revolutionary leaders fully appreciate
that the issue must be decided by the at
titude of the army, which is yet to cast
the die.
Instructions have gone ' forth that ris
ings must occur everywhere in order to
test the troop's, and if a foothold can be
secured it ls the intention of the revolu
tionaries to set. up a provisionalxgovern
ment and proclaim a republic.
ALLEGED MUTINY OP GIIEXADIERS.
Thus far reports from Moscow do not
clear up the vital point as to whether
any of the troops there actually refused
to obey commands, although there are
persistent rumors that they did. Revolu
tionary leaders here .claim to. have con
firmation of a report that a grenadier
brigade and some Cossacks mutinied and
are. now locked uo in their barracks.
While the military-; .succeeded every
where in driving the insurgents from
their barricades in Moscow on Saturday
night, the defeat evidently was not a de
cisive one, as . barricades were again
thrown' up in dozens of places this morn
ing and fighting was renewed before U
o'clock.
Orders have been issued for an uprising
here, but the Government's measures
seemingly render this impossible. No
meetings, public or private, are allowed,
which makes an assembly of more than
five, persons In a private lodging illegal.
The prisons and jails are filled with leadr
ers of the reTolutionaries and agitators.
Two caches of arms have, been seized and
an entire organization, 'consisting" of .300
"Crujina," as the student militia is called,
has been captured.
CAPITAL UNUSUALLY CALM.
Rumors . were persistently circulated
that a conflict would be precipitated at a
demonstration of workmen in the Nevsky
prospect this afternoon, but they proved
tobe unfounded. The city, in fact, was
unusually calm on - the. surface, and a
stranger dropping down the Nevsky pros 7
pect this afternoon . would have seen no
evidences .of ferment. It was a bright,
crisp winter day arid smart sleigha.andi
equipages -of the aristocracy, with their
occupants cloaked in sables and other
rich furs, were out in force. Only the
sullen faces of the crowds of strikers on
the sidewalks and heavy horse and foot
patrols on every block looked ominous.
If the plans of , the revolutionaries to
produce an uprising in St.\ Petersburg
fail, as it is believed they will, an at
tempt certainly will b"e madV to terrorize
the Government â¢by guerrilla warfare; in
which bombs will play the chief role. The
Government having embarked in a war
against the "reds," it is difficult to see
how it can draw back one step.
The acceptance by Governor General
Doubassoff of Moscow of the offer of the
notorious reactionary. Prince TcherbatonV
to organize the loyalists as a militia has
created a shudder of horror. .

ORIENTAL TRADE
SHOWS BIG GAIN
Exports From United States
to China and "Japan Far
Above All Former Years
WASHINGTON, -Dec. 24.â N0 feature
of the export trade of the United States
for 1905 has shown a larger growth than
the trade with China and Japan, says a
bulletin issued by the Bureau of Statis
tics of the Department of Commerce and
Labor. ; In the ten months ending with
October, j exports to China aggregated
more than $50,000,000 in value, against $20,
000,000 in the same months of 1904.. Ex
ports to Japan were $46,500J)00 against a
little . less, than $22,000,000- for the name
period in 1904 and $16,000,000. in .the, corre
sponding months of 1903. No other coun
try of the world to which our * exports
are sent show gains' aproximating these
of China and Japan. . . -
The growth in exports to China from
the United States is especially marked in
copper, \ cotton cloth, flour,- sewing ma
chines, locomotives; "paper,' canned beef,"
manufactures of tobacco and lumber,
though cotton* cloth and copper are by
far the most Important of these items.
To Japan the growth occurred 1 in flour,
carriages and other vehicles, raw cotton,
agricultural machinery, sewing' machines,
locomotives, leather, paper, canned " beef,
tobacco and lumber. ':\u25a0"\u25a0'\u25a0 :i \u25a0 :
Cotton cloth exports to China in -the
ten months ending with October aggre
gated In value $27,405,450, against $9,657,707
in the same months of 1904. Copper ex-,
ports to China are comparatively a new
feature of, our trade with that country;
the amount "in the months ending with
October '/. having . been $11;326, 407, against
$611,677 in the. same months-of last year.
The copper is .used in making new copper,
coins... Flour. ls about the only. important
article of .export to China showing, any.
material reduction this year, while man
ufactured tobacco shows a material. In

Cotton exports \to Japan , for the ten
months ending ; with October aggregated
in I value *13,754,399, against, $2,716,529 last
year. American cotton is'popular with" the
Japanese, spinners because \u25a0it has a Tong
staple, but .the cottqh grown Jn India^and
China, which has a; shorter staple, Is con
siderably lower/in' price : and' in the years

The accident was witnessed by Mar

the two automobiles when the accident
occurred.
The machine driven by the younger
Martin started first from the Golf Club

wished to be in New York for dinner.
The larger and heayier machine, with
Martin Sr. and party, followed not long
afterward and midway between Bay
side and Flushing overtook the lighter

way to allow the other. to pass and an
attempt was made to' do so.
The road appeared to be in good con

SIX FIREMEN
ARE HURT IN
HOTEL FIRE
Continued from Page 1, Col. 5.
of the downtown section was at work.
TJie fire was with difficulty 1 confined
to the hotel building-. Another brick
building occupied by commercial
houses was adjoining on the north, and
it was. only with much effort that the
fire was prevented from t spreading In
that direction. A vacant lot was on
the south of the hotel. The Angelus
Hotel, one of the largest hotels in
Southern California, was Immediately
in the rear of the Van Nuysv.on Spring
street, with only an alley separating
the two buildings, ' and had the fire
spread it, too, would undoubtedly have
been burned. The guests of the Ange
lus were aroused by. the fire, but there
was no excitement among them. Â£
The Van Nuys Broadway Hotel,
which should not be confused with
the Van . Nuys Hotel, was a five-story
brick .building:, built seven years ago
and valued at $150,000. There were
125 rooms in the hotel. 'and nearly all
were occupied. "About fifty of- the
guests in the hotel were women. The
hotel safe, which- was filled with val
uables and money, lies in the basement
of the building, and it Is not known
whether its contents are Intact or not.
On the ground floor of the hotel were
the \u25a0 stores of the . California Paper
Company . and the hardware store of
Cass-Damerel Company, both of which
were completely destroyed. A portion
of the Van Nuys Broadway cafe fur
nishings and some of the hotel office
furniture was taken out. The base
ment of the building, in which was
stored valuable goods of the stores and
other effects, ls filled. with water to a
depth of three feet.
The, Ore was not under control until
10:30, and was not i extinguished until
after ; noon. .It . burned . with much
fierceness and the firemen fought it
with difficulty. Almost the entire In
terior of the .building collapsed shortly
before 10 o'clock, . carrying down
every thing, in the hotel rooms, which
was not already damaged by fire into
the basement filled with water.
Mrs. E. Blxel of Los Angeles suf
fered the loss of personal effects to the
amount of $2000. She had Just arrived
from the East Saturday and gone to
the hotel on account of her house be
ing rented for the winter.
/Mra. E. A. McDonald of this city,
who has just" rented her residence, 202
West Twenty- fourth street, f or . the
winter, lost valuables and clothing to

"Mrs. M. G. v Underwood of "Waverly,

floor of the hotel with -her aged moth
er, Mrs. Mary Griffith, with great diffi
culty. Hedged In by smoke and be
wildered by the . confusion, they sev

most suffocated .before they got : out-
Miss .Underwood lost clothing and Jew

caped, in their; night clothes.
../J.iW.Searles and wife of Cleveland,

F. J. Bleeker of Falrbanks t Alaska,

When he' got out the halls were full of
smoke and the elevator - had stopped
and s he â¢ had i a close call; from suffoca

carried down his clothes and grips In
his arms.
F. J, 'Abbott, of London, "an English

HE STOLE FITZ'S WIFE
Says Story Is False and Threatens to "Let Daylight" "Through
the Form of the Lanky Pugilist Who Accuses Him.
Special r>ispa.toh to The CaJL
FRANKLIN, Ta.. Dee. 24.â Major
Charles Joseph Sibley Miller, who was
reported to have eloped with Mrs. Rob
ert Fltzsimmons, formerly Julia May Gif
\u25a0 ford, arrived here from New York City
this morning, accompanied by tho Mar-
Cuis de Tc-rre Hcrxnoso of Madrid.
"When your correspondent called at Mil
ler Park, the home of Major Miller,
attorney William H. Ford had been
called into consultation. Major Miller,
ttiou*-!) appearing brave, is fearful that
the jealous prizefighter. Bob Fitzsim
mons, will attack him. In the presence
of his attorney and the Marquis, his
companion. Major Miller made the fol
lowing- statement:
"Robert Fitzsimmons must be going
crazy if he accuses me of eloping with
his wife. I have not eloped with her.
I have rto intention of eloping with
her, and never did have any such idea
even for a single moment. I have not
seen Julia May Gifford, the wife of
Kitzsimmons, for some time, certainly
not on my last trip to New Tuork City.
"The first intimation that 1 had of
Mrs. Fitzsimmons leuvii.g her husband
was in the nevrspapt-s this morning.
There is no better proof that I am not
eloping with any one tnan the fact that
1 am here at my tome, where i should
be to sper.d Christmas.
"I have known Mrs. Fitzsimmons for
about eight years. I knew her before
Fitz did. I know her to be all that is
dee and knew ht-.r to be a perfect lady.
The last time that I saw Mrs. Fitzsim
mons was in June of this year, when
She was groing abroad to Paris to study
vocal music. I accompanied her to the
â¢t<?amship in New York City and saw
her off. She had no one olse to go with
her and I went to the dock, the. same
as I would with any other friend.
Fitzsimmons knew that I accompanied
his wife to the dock. He was mad
Â«bout it end has never got over it.
He gfts mad every lime he thinks of it.
"Fitzsimmons is insanely jealous and
T.-hÂ«~n word came fro^i her that she was
leaving him for all time ho evidently
jumped at tho. conclusion that I was
poing with herl He and Leon Fried
man, his ma:iaÂ£';r. have it in for me, but
they are foolish.
"The fallen pugilist had better keep
in hie own path, if he comes bother
ing around ire with any of his talk
about me eloping with his wife I \u25a0will
IÂ«t daylight through him. I mean what
I say and will not tolerate his cir
culating Buch scandalous stories
about mÂ«\"
The Marquie ue Hermoso, who had
listened to the conversation of bis
friend about his relations with Mr.".
Fitzr-Jmmons with great sincerity
lidded:
â¢I have born in the company of Ma
jor M:ll<r during tho time he socnt in
New York oji his hist visit and accom
panied hJm to Franklin. I pm cer
tain we did not meet a Mrs. Fitzsim
mons, or a Miss G'.fford. as you f*all her.
I have not the pleasure of her acquaint
ance."
During the conversation Mrs. Miller,
a beautiful woman, entered the room.
Tli" subject of conversation was im
mediately dropped on her entrance.'
Traces in her face indicated that she
had been weeping. The storieF of her
husband's elopement and the night of
â¢ nxiety. for she had received no word
from bim until bis arrival thfs morn
ing, had caused her much sorrow.
Major Miller resides at Miller Park.
The hou.^e was built for him by Mrs!
Millers father In 1532. The house has
Tor!y-two rooms, no two of which are
the same size and shape. 'In the house
is a beautiful chapel, -where the family
â¢worship is held. The palinroom is filled
â¢with trophies of Major Miller's prowess
sf an automobile racer and there are
silver and g-old tankards, flagons and
trophy cups to fill a freight car.

These were the words of Martin Julian,
a brother of Fitzsimmons' second wife,
and uncle of his children, when he heard
of the disappearance of Julia May Glfford
and the allegation that she had carried
off Fitz's money, jewelry and the deeds
to his property. The property is worth
$18,000. Julian says there was about $14,
000 on d<2->os!t in the bank when Fitz
filmraons married the chorus girl and the
prize fighter was so enamored of his third
wife that he readily consented to trans
fer the bank account to her name when
she begged it of him.
Rose Fitzsimmons. the pugilist's sec
ond wife, left about $6000 In jewelry which
the court ordered should be given to her
children. The bank account stood in her
name at the time and Fitz obtained its
release as a trustee. He was made ad
ministrator of the Estate. He "loaned"
the chorus girl the jewelry and she wore
it when she apj>eared in public.
The throe children of the prize fighter
are now In a convent at Orange, N. J.
Their property in Bensonhurst brings
them a fair Income.

NEW YORK. Dec. 24. â On account of
Sunday and the holiday of Christmas
it will not be possible to discover the
fate of Fitzsimmons' bank deposit until
Tuesday. Mrs. Fitzsimmons has not
been identified as a passenger by any
out-going liner, and the matter of the
jewels will probably have to await
her husband's return to New York.

Take 'Wife Back!
For the first time since his fight
with "Philadelphia" Jack O'Brien Bob
Fitzsimmons managed to produce a
smile yesterday. The cause of this
little side play was a rumor that
reached the ears of the Lanky Cornlsli
man that Major Miller, his wife's friend,
was going to shoot him on sight. This
sounded very funny to the veteran of
half a hundred battles. He can see a
picture of Miller stalking tho streets
armed with a young arsenal In search
of gore. Fit* says he would like to
meet Miller face to face and Is willing
to allow him the privilege of a hundred
revolvers if that would do anything 1 to
ward bringing about the meeting.
"Hit's all over now," said Fitz. "Hi
would never take 'er back again. Hi
loved *er once, but this settles it for

Holland of Submarine Fame
Describes Machine Which
Will 3lake Flying Possible
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Dec. 24.â "1 propose
personally to test my flying machine
early next spring and I am confident
that I shall be .able to soar through
the air from my home in Newark to
my office at 5 Nassau street. New York,
with the greatest -of ease. Within
twelve months we will all be able
to fly."
John P. Holland, tho wizard of sub
marine boat construction, . made the
above declaration to-night.
"When I say that we all will be us
ing flying machines within a year's
time," continued Holland with a smile,
"I mean that every one who cares to
do so can-be afforded the opportunity
through the use of aeroplanes and fly
ing madhlnes.
"Dirigible balloons and the combination
of aeroplane and balloon navigated by
Knabenshue over New York will never
become practicable for ordinary aerial
navigation because of the gas bag neces
sary to sustain them in their flight. There
Is too much resistance to the air in the
gas balloons, and they will shortly be
done away with. In their plac# will be
substituted the aeroplanes and flying ma
chines. The aeroplane with gasoline mo
tors will be used for the flight of more
than one person and the transit of mails.
The flying machine will be used for one
man aerial locomotion. .--Â»
"Observation of the working of na
ture's forces led to my discovery, and it
is surprising to me that some one did not
discover it before. My flying machine
consists of four wings propelled by the
motion of the arms and legs of the oper
ator. A transverse bar of steel tubing
carrying wings of silk with aluminum
framing on each is attached to the back
of the neck and another at the hips.
Each set vibrates in an opposite direction
from the other
"The wings measure twelve feet from
tip to tip and are eighteen inches
wide. While two wings a
rising vibrations the other" two _ are
descending, thus affording" mutual sup
port. In motion one of the forward
wings is arising while the other is
descending, and the situation is vice
versa with the rear or hip wings.
"A speed of forty miles an hour can
easily be secured by an active man. A
man walking at the rate of three miles
an hour o . land will be able to move
at the rate of fifteen miles an hour
with no more exertion."

"We have not been in America in three

Mr. Corey has not been here. There is no
more likelihood of my marrying Mr.
Corey than of my marrying any other
married man of my acquaintance. When
I saw Mr. Corey and his wife at dinner

when they get rich, frequently . neglect
each other. The cause of domestic trou
bles is more frequently found In the fam

â¢I protest against the custom of mak
ing theatrical scapegoats for the domestic
troubles of millionaires. If wives have dif
ficulties with their husbands, lyric artists
are rarely the cause. Our calling is too
exacting to a.low us to be home-wreck

sarily, we are always before the public,
and often are good looking, and Jealous
women like Mrs. Schwab lightly point the
finger of scorn at us. If these people

they would realize that our thoughts are
occupied with subjects other than their
husbands.

NEW YORK, Dec. - 25. â The Demo

In the New York State Republican par
ty ranks and are doing all they can to
encourage the warring factions. The
Democratic New York World says this
morning:
"Chairman Odell is preparing 'to

certain large sum for campaign pur
poses was raised last year at the Presi

prove more startling even than the rev

made by the New York, Equitable and

Ing inside facts, and those who appear
to be in Odell's confidence assert that,
before he is through with the Presi

"Both sides apparently regard Wads

was by appointment and Wadsworth re
mained for a half-hour with the Presi

events which have preceded and followed
the selection of Wadsworth by the Gov
ernor as his choice for party leader in
the lower house.
"The President was anxious to know all
about the situation," said Wadsworth. "I
gave him all the facts in the case, and
so far. as I know there is nothing to add
to whaVhas already been said on the sub
ject. Neither the President, my father
nor I knew I was to be a candidate for
the Speakerahip when I left here about a
week ago for Albany. I reached there on
Sunday, pledged to support Assembly
man Hooker for the position. It was after
I arrived that I learned that Governor
Hlggins desired me to make a contest for
the position. I am in the fight to stay,
and I have every confidence that I will
win. There Is to be no compromise."
Wadsworth said he thought the Presi

Representative Cook's statement, issued
last week.

Special Dispatch ta The Call.
KI\GMAX, Kans.. Dec. 24. â "Father,
I am tfjlug; I have been forced to take
potion by the men who hate you, and
who threatened to kill you, too, It I did
not drink the stuff."
With this written message clasped in
his hands Clarence Albright, one of the
leading cattlemen In this section of
Kansas, and over whose body an inquest
is now being held, was found dead at
his country home near here. His
father, also a prominent cattleman,
reached his side as he was breathing
his last.
The case is one of the most mysteri
ous in Southwest Kansas. Monday
night, December IS, was spent by Clar
ence Albright at the home of his
father, five miles away. Early on
Tuesday morning he rode to his own
cattle ranch. An hour after his arrival
he called the telephone operator and
asked the girl to tell his father that ha
was very ill, dying perhaps, and to
utge him to hurry to his side.
The message was transmitted to the
elder Albright, and the father started at
once for the home of his son. The young
er man had lost consciousness before his
father arrived, and five minutes after his
father reached him he was dead. The
written message was signed and evident
ly had been the cattleman's last message
before death.
The stomach of the dead man was
opened and disclosed the fact that death
was due to carbolic acid poisoning.
Since hardy frontiersmen began to fill
up the Kansas plains the Albright family
has prospered, and in the years that have
parsed they have made many enemies.
Petty quarrels have arisen, and there
have been troubles of a grave nature
that threatened to disrupt the entire
community in which they made their
home.

we do with It?" " announced Mrs. Charles,
F. Millspaugh. president of the Cook*
County League of Women's Clubs.
The .title had a promising sound. There
was a round of applause and there were
approving mutterings. but Mr. Went
worth did not flay the saloon. He de
ferrtled the saloon, declared that beer was
as healthful as any beverage which might
be substituted and said the worklngman
and his tin pail were inseparable. And he
said many other things. Speaking of tho
workingman's love .for, his . beer, Mr.
Wentworth declared:
"He does not want coffeeâ that is harm
ful: milk Is debilitating, and water is
polluted. He must drink; can you provide
anything that will take the place of bis
beer?"
In conclusion Mr. Wentworth urged "thÂ©
club women to work for a better saloon.
Instead of trying to -aine it out of ex
istence. He declared the saloon of the
German type, where families could gather
and listen to good music and eat good
meal 3, would be a splendid thing for Chi
cago.

HEARTLESSNESS
Woman Returns From Hos
pital to . Find Her Home
Looted by the Neighbors
HER PLIGHT IS PITIFUL
Yuletidc Merriment a Mock
ery to Mrs. Kirch, Who
Is Victim of Wretches
BERKELEY, Dec. 24.â Mrs. Mary Kirch
ef liÂ£l Jones street. West Berkeley, ill
and without mowy, returned to her home
from a hospital yesterday, where she had
lain for three weeks, to find that her
neighbor?, indifferent to the sentiment of
the merry yuUtlde season, had broken
into her house and rofibed her of every
thing of vtilue efte had possessed.
Also, Mrs. Kirch's husband, whose
t>lows had injured her so that the triD to
the hospital became a necessity, had dis
appeared. Mrs. Kirch was without hus
band, without food, without bed clothing,
fuel, raoney and ill besides.
Mrs. Kirch wept. On the cold floor of
her cheerless excuse for a home she sank
down, mocked by the memory of
Christmas days in other years. The fact
that the world of . folk outeide rode on a
Â«= welling tide of Christmas gayety, with
"'peace on earth, good will toward men,"
es the princioal staye t of their merry
making did not lessen the bitterness of
Mrs. Kirch's broodinjrs.
- Instead of receiving Christmas 'gifts,
she had been despoiled of all her be
longings by heartless thieves of the neigh
borhood. Too wretched to sally forth and
seek warmth, food or shelter, she lay
\u25a0 lone In her home, until her moans were
heard by a passer-by, who ascertained
her condition!
Marshal Vollmer was notified last night
w>t Mrs. Kirch's predicament. Officer
Joseph Leonard investigated the case, and
reported the facts. The Associated Char
ities of Oakland were informed and
agreed to provide for the woman. Mar
shal Vollmer directed that blankets be
taken from the police station to the
Kirch home, and the woman be made
comfortable for the night, which was
done.
It appears that the neighbors of Mrs.
Kirch have long believed that she Is a
miser, possessed of large sums of money
and other valuables, which she was sup
posed to have hidden in her home. They
Improved the opportunity created by her
absence to learn whether she was really
a miser, or merely an impecunious per
son. Mrs. Kirch swears that if they found
money In the house they found more than
she ever was able to discover. Falling
In the hunt for hidden gold, the vandals
took what they could, which included
everything in the house from saucepans
to pincushions, and from blankets to
coals.
A erar.g known as the "Buzzards" that
inhabits a house in the neighborhood, Is
believed to have been responsible for the
outrage upon Mrs. Kirch, and Marshal
Vollmer has announced his determination
to break up this gang and to punish the
thieves who looted the lone woman's
house.

at 1640 Haste street in this city.
Marshal Vollmer has been informed
of Lux's escape, and his men will
watch for the possible return of the
escaped lunatic. Lux was committed

wife, who swore that her husband was
afflicted with religious mania. Lux
believed he was Christ reincarnated,

SCHOOLBOY ACCIDENTALLY KILLED
WITH RIFLE BY HIS FRIEND.
William Dorffel' Sends Ball Into Head of
Chrystalj Anderson in Oakland.
BOY WHO ACCIDENTALLY 6HOT
AND KILLED A PLAYMATE IN
OAKLAND YESTERDAY.
OAKLAND, Dec 24.â "William Dorffel,
aged 17 years and son of well-to-do par
entÂ«, is held at the County Jail on a
charge of having shot and killed Chrystal
Anderson, aged 12, this afternoon-
William was fooling with a gun and
says he thought It was not loaded. Sher
iff Frank Barnet, who investigated the
shooting, says he thinks it was an acci
dent.
The youth's father recently bought the
old Middloton r/ome, at Twenty-third ave
nue and East Twenty-fourth street, Just
outside the city limits. He left the son
in charge when the family went away for
the holidays a week ago. This afternoon
Chrystal Anderson was visiting George
Raamussen, son of O. H. Rasmussen. gar
dener of the place, and Mrs. Rasmussen
sent the two boys to the Dorffel house for
some bread.
GÂ«orge Rasmussen took a 22-caliber rifle
with him and when they neared the house
William met them and demanded to see
the Pun. As he held it in his hands he
accidentally pulled the trigger and the
bullet went crashing into Anderson's
skull.
The boy fell and Dorffel says he ran to
the telephone in the house and notified
Dr. Beckwith, who. when he arrived, or
dered Chrystal taken to Fablola Hospital.
Dorffel was arrested and taken to the
City Prison, but later Sheriff Barnet re
moved him to the County Jail, where he
made the following statement:
I was standing in front of the house when
I saw George Rasmussen and Chryital Ander
eon approaching. George had a gun and I
asked him to let me examln* It. When he
gave me thÂ« weapon I didn't know it was
loaded and I accidentally pulled the trigger.
There was a loud report and Anderson cried,
â¢â¢Ob I'm hurt." and fell to the ground. ( I
wa*'badly frightened, but I carried him to the
office Jn our bouse and immediately summoned
Dr Beckwith by telephone. I didn't know the
gun was loaded or I would not hayÂ« been so
careless.
Sheriff Barntt telegraphed to Dorffel's
father, who Is In Seattle, immediately
after the arrest.
Anderson died at 6:20 o'clock this even
ing at Fablola Hospital, after Dr. Beck
wiih had unsuccessfully probed for the
bullet. The missile entered the head in
the middle of the forehead and struck the
rear of the skull, taking a slightly up
ward course. ' -
Anderson was a schoolboy and lived near
the Middieton homestead, on Twenty
third avenue.

HOLIDAYS HAVE
LITTLE EFFECT
Preparations for Christmas
Cause No Lull in Activity
of the Real Estate Market
OAKLAND, Dec. 24.â Although .every
one has been busy with preparation for
the Christmas holidays during the last
week, there has been no appreciable lull
In the activity of the local real estate
market and Oakland and Alameda Coun
ty dealers have had their hands full to
take care of the business which has been
coming in steadily. The month of De
cember has been far in advance of the
same month last year as far as sales of
real estate are concerned, and there is no
doubt that all past records for local busi
ness will be broken by that of the pres
ent year.
One of the most important deals of the.
last week was the purchase of the Cordes
tract, on Athens avenue, between San
Pablo avenue and Market street, by -H.
B. Belden, a well-known real estate deal
er, from Ohlandt & Buck. The .price paid
for the property was about $40,000, and
the purchaser will at once improve the
property and place it on the market. On
the north side of the tract Mr. Belden
will at once begin theerection.of a num
ber of handsome residences, the total cost
of -which will be in the neighborhood of
$00,000.
Another important transaction was the
sale of the gore block at the Junction of
Broadway and Telegraph avenue by
George Roeth, who recently. acquired the
property at a cost of $40,000. The property
has been purchased by the directors of
the First National Bank and will be used
as a site for a handsome new bank build
ing, the plans for which have already
been drawn by D. H. Burnham & Co. of
Chicago.. The directors of ,. the, bank are
P. E. 'Bowles, Li. G. Burpee, W. H. Chlck
ering, E. A. Heron, V. H. Metcalf, I* C.
Morehouse. Wallace Everson, E. W. Run
yon and W.-H. Taylor. -It Is 'expected
that the cost of the new bank building
will be $125,000. '
JohnH. Spring has just purchased eighty
acres of land in Clarembn't from' Mrs. Ma
tilda Dunn. The property is known as
the Dunn tract and contains some of the
best residence property In that section of
Oakland. It is near the elte of the pro
posed Claremont tourist hotel. The price
paid for the tract was about $100,000.
Equal activity has been shown in real
estate in other sections of Alameda Coun
ty, \u25a0 and there la little doubt that the
present year will be the banner year for

JURIST PLEADS
FOR PURE LIFE
Berkeley Judge Urges Young
Men to Eschew Evil and
Strive for Cleanliness
PAINTS DARK PICTURE
Courtroom Experiences Pro
vide William H. Waste
With Telling Material
BERKELEY, Dec. 24.â 1n eloquent
words and with the fervor of one who de-
Clares himself a disciple of the Nazarene,
Judge William H. Waste of the Superior
Court of Alameda County this afternoon
discoursed to a 'great crowd of men in
the Y. M. C. A. Hall upon "The Value of
a Clean Life." Allying himself unequiv
ocally with those who bow to Jesus Christ
as supreme authority, Judge Waste de
clared that in him is the one perfect ex
pression of a perfectly clean, holy life,
whose example it is men's duty to follow
and whose aid is to be sought in the un
dertaking. '
The- horrors of an unclean life, its
dreadful consequences and the penalties
paid by the unclean were | pictured by
Judge Waste, the material for his word
paintings being taken by him from his
experiences as a lawyer. State legislator
and Superior Court Judge. He said:
I wish that each man I address to-day might
have, for his soul's good, to impress him with
the value of a clean life, a glimpse of the
wretched beings 'who pass through the courts,
through my own court, almost every, day.
Those unfortunates, though they remain silent,
would be a more eloquent appeal and a more
startling warning than any worda of mine
could be. They would warn against unclean
ness â against excesses of every kind. They
would appeal to your Imagination, and could
not but serve to Inspire you with a determina
tion to avoid the sins that brought them there.
Idiots, maniacs. Insane persons of various de
grees of madness, whose misfortunes . are the
result of sinful living, of unclean practice*â
these are the beings who have Utterly 'failed 'to
appreciate the value of a clean^lile. v They,are.
bankrupt in morals, in will power, in physical
and mental soundness. And in the prisons at
San Quontln and Folsom are' thousands of
other men, wretched convicts, . whom we are
not likely to think of at 1 this happy holiday
time, but whose lives are examples of what un
clean men pay for their uncleanhess. . \u25a0 , ! .
Their terrible condition is a natural end of
an unclean life. Three boys have been ' in
our courts during the last few weeks^ â Schnei
der, Pembroke, Crowhurst â whose attack upon
a man they envied for his gold k has ' brought
upon themselves and their families untold'mis
ery. They were not clean, as little boys nor as
young men. The result has been In evidence
In our courts. Be warned by. their end. .
Look for a moment upon another picture, the
picture of such a man as Theodore Koosevelt â
noble, clean, manly, a Christian: gentleman and
President of the United , States. .. â¢ His Inspira
tion is Jesus Christ. â¢ "The' NaSarene la his pat
tern, as he Is of-'evexy Christian.:- Strive to-be

have been murdered, and to-day they
Called upon young Schneider, who has
been sentenced to life imprisonment,
thinking that after beins sentenced for
the murder of Cook the boy might tell
Something of their child. But Schneider
declares absolutely that he has no know
ledge of Wagenet's disappearance.
1 Mrs. Wagenet, who was accompanied
by her husband, said to-day, after inter
viewing Schneider:
' Harry I>. Wagenet is my eon and left home
August 24. 1802. He was tho oldest of six
children and was an exemplary son. He
Worked as a \u25a0 machinist's apprentice at the
Vulcan Iron Works and in. 1901 -ho was In
timidated by the union men when there was a
strike of the Iron workers. He told mo that
he was often threatened and followed to ' our
home at 1228 East Twenty-eecond street. The
<Jay he left us ho was very careful to ask me
about my condition, : for I was In \u25a0 poor health
at that time. He told me then that he had
been followed by two men the night .before,
but he said hÂ« would take a bicycle ride, no
matter what happened. That was tho last
time I saw him. We thought then that he had
been shanghaied, but since wÂ« have learned
Qf the "Jim Crow" gang In Fruitvale and
Binco it was on thÂ« sarno corner whero Cook
was murdered that my boy was last seen, we
feel that he might have met the same fate
and that he and his bicycle were thrown Into
tho estuary to be carried out by the tide. .
John Schneider, one of the "Jim Crow"
gang, who has received a life sentence in
the penitentiary, said: .
. I knew Wagenet only casually, but I am sure
tho "Jim Crow" gang, if you wish to call them
that, had nothing to do with * his J disappear
ance. I have nothing to lose now, since I am
In for life, and hereafter I shall tell only the
truth. Wagenet disappeared suddenly, but I
don't think the "bunch" had anything to do
with it. He was older than wo and paid no
attention to us. My opinion is that 'he
"skipped" on his wheel,. 1

joy themselves with the abandon of children
or with tha unconventionallty of the poor.

are in progress In the north, and farther
south'the aborigines are preparing a great

amount to $4000.
This is expected to be the largest gath

furnish one Indian band. These bands
will enter Into . a music competition, for
which Chief Takush has offered large

Dr. John Fyfe one of the Editorial Staff

of Unicorn root (Helonicu Vioica) which

"A remedy which Invariably acts as a uter-

He continues "in Helonlas we have a medica-

culiar to women it is seldom that Â» case is
seen which does not present some indication
for this remedial Â«Â«enti." Dr. Fyfe further
says : " The following are among the leading
Indications for Helonlas (Unicorn root). Pain

OAKLAND. Dec. 24.â Betrayed and be
trayer is the fate of Miss M. L-ulu Bowen.
*elf -confessed embezzler of thousands of
dollars from the United States Postoffice
Department. For years a trusted clerk,
the young woman succumbed under the.
_$ pressure, hypi.otic, mesmeric, or what you
please, of a man who, according to the
weak and foolish victim's own explana
tions, had persuaded her to be^ false to
her trust, false to herself and false to the
kindly woman that had given her the
means of a livelihood.
Like a chapter from fiction runs the
story of the downfall of this poor 6lip
of a woman. And upon the head of Louis i
WJ Baker she places the burden of guilt.'
oqua! to her own la law. If her story be I
true, and still more culpable is he mor- j
ally. For, says Miss Bowen, Baker knew !
whence came the plethora of coin which ;
he won from this infatuated woman for '
the mere asking.
In the Bowen home a widowed mother
weep? for her daughter, who] wracked
by Qualms of conscience only too late
aroused, sits in a prison cell, comfortless,
distracted and r.igh to collapse. Sisters
end parent suffering torture of mind over
the terrible revelations, which have
turned the yuletide rejoicing into gloom
of blackened hue, are on the one side,
while a wife, prostrate over the dis
closures of her husband's faithlessness,
keeps vigil alone, fearing that worse is to
come.
In the minds of the authorities, Louis
V.'. Baker, head of the Baker Printing
Company, 42C Xinth street, the man Miss
Bowen says got the thousands she stole.
Is a fugitive. They believe he received
warning of the impending crash in time
to escape, temporarily at least, the clutch
of the stern Federal officers. They feel
that the story of a hunting
trip off to the duck sloughs at Petaluma
was only a tale coneopted to deceive wife
and' friends, that the real cause for his
going might not be suspected.
STEALS FOB LOVE.
And in the county jail, sleepless, wan
and undone. Js the woman who. has sacri
ficed good name and all for this runaway.
It. is a tale for the novelist.
In ptill another home Is the benefac
tress, the kindly philanthropic woman
who, for charity and friendship, ha* jeop
ardized many dollars. "Mrs. Matilda
Brown, president of the Kings. Daugh
ters' Homo, leader in church # and social
work, is the responsible person to whom
the United States Government will look
for recompense. Mrs. Brown knew Miss
Bo wen as an earnest, quiet, simple young
woman, who took keen, delight, appar
ently, in' furthering the work upon which
the older woman's heart was most set. In
the field of religious activity both women
found a congenial meeting ground. From
acquaintances there formed it was no
wonder that Mips Bowen could ingratiate
herself and become a sort of protege of
Mrs. Brown.
When Mrs. Brown was appointed at
pub-station Xo. 1 on Broadway, she in
stalled Mtes Bowen there. The $700 a
ypar allowed by the Government to the
Station was divided between Miss Bowen,
who received $420. or $35 a month, and the
r^nt. $22.50 a month. The net return" to
Mrs. Brown was about 85 cents a month:
The station was originally established in
the Interests of tenants in the half block
o^ned by Mrs. Brown. After she sold the
property fome t'me ago, her,. relatives
tried to persuade her to give up the % clerk
ship. But Fhe demurred, saying that if
the did so Miss Bowen would lose her po
\u25a0ltion. So the change was not made,
t'nfortunate Mr?. Brown!
And with all this, when the exposure

MENT CASE IN OAKLAND.
came last night, Mrs. Brown's words, as
the disgraced young woman left her to go
to jail, were: "God bless you, and God
forgive you."
But the postoffice authorities do not :
look on the sentimental side of things in
dealing with thefts from the Government.
The history of Miss Bowen's undoing, so
far as the Postoffice Department goes, is
straightaway.- .
FEDERAL- OPFIQERS AWAKE.
Back in Washington, in the auditing
branch of the Postofflce Department, a
discrepancy 'was noted last week In the i
accounts of sub-station No. X in Oakland. ;
The first suspicion was aroused because
too much tirr.o elapsed between the issue
of money orders ayd the filing as paid of i
i the duplicate orders. Investigation dis- i
'closed other peculiar circumstances. As!
soon as suspicion arose the department!
telegraphed direct to the United States j
postoffice inspectors at San Francisco to |
take charge. That is the rule in all such
cases... lnspector R. W. Maddern on Fri
day received instructions to handle ' the
case. I
Saturday morning he went unannounced
to station 1, took the books and began to
check. All day long he worked. While
he checked. Miss Bowen, who must have
known exposure was near, sat at her
desk placidly transacting the office busi
ness without a sign of guilt. In the big
rush of holiday work she kept at her post
while the inspector, not fifty feet away,
was overhauling the suspected records.
When the office closed at 6 o'clock the
inspector directed Miss Bowen to accom*
pany him to the pOEtofflce. There were
Postmaster T. T. Dargie, Assistant Post
master Paul Shafer, Mrs. Matilda Brown
and her son, Assistant District Attorney
Everett Brown.
Not a sign nor a movement did the
young woman make. In the presence
of all of them Inspector Ma'ddern told
the clerk that her books showed a dis
crepancy.
"I know it," was the. calm reply.
\u25a0 "Who's the man?" demanded Mad
dern, for he, worldly wise, had sus
picions.
"There is no man," replied Miss
Bowen.
Then the inspector, and a postoÂ£ice
official were left alone with the woman.
When the name of Louis W. Baker
was pronounced the clerk wilted.
WOMAN LOSES ALL
Slowly but deliberately she made the
confession. She had known . Baker a
long tlmeJ He. had come to. her with
explanations of what he^needed in' his
business. , She should, know, for had
she nol^ kept his books for him for
six years? Indeed she had and the
way was easy. for Baker. Miss. Bowen
said he got' first $20, then $50,'.thenl8he
lifted a mortgage of $1100 on his print-
Ing- plant with money she "stole- from
the pojÂ»tofflce. And many: more dol
lars went, Bhe admitted, to moet his
greedy demands, until the total has

reached between $6000 ands7ooo. That
Baker received every- dollar of the em
bezzled money and knew where every
dollar of it came from. ls the belief of
the postofflce authorities.
That It was used in his printing busi
ness the officials very much doubt.
They are convinced it went into other
channels, perhaps .the race track. No
one knows except Baker, and he is in
flight. â¢
Miss Bowen was acquainted with Baker
before she became - his bookkeeper.
For six years she occupied, that posi
tion, but did the work: after her office
hours. Naturally .the association, led to
friendly relations, but this friendship
was established' at ..the expense j of - a
duty Baker owed his wife and; family.
Such at least is theconstruction placed
upon the situation by the postofflce peo
ple. Since yesterday the fact, has be
come patent, that Baker haunted the
sub-station at. 963 Broadway. He was
trsere morning.- noon -and iiight. His
visits had become so frequent thai at
tention was closely .attracted ; to . him
because the fact that- he was married
was known to observers.. -
VICTIM OF THE MAX.
Itjwas this knowledge, coupled with
collateral facts?, which -â¢ led Inspector
Maddern to his suspicio.. that the girl
had been the victim of. a stronger mind,
presumably that of a man. -The au-'i
thoritles suspect that Miss Bowen her
self might have "tipped" Baktr yes-Â»
terdayiiiat' trouble: was brewing. -/He '
was seen at the station at 11 o'clock'
and was on Broadway at 1- o'clock yes
terday afternoon, clad in : a khaki; suit.
Baker told friends he was going, on a
hunting trip to Petaluma. When the
Baker residence, 997 Tenth' street, was
searched last night by. Inspector Mad
dern Mrs. Baker made the same explana
tion ns to her husband's 'absence, but
she also admitted that this was the first^
minting trip he had taken for* years.'
Baker is a smooth, suave/ easy-going,
not ill-appearing: man of 35 years. Miss
Bowen is 28 years of age, of â¢ slight
physique and characterles; countenance.
She has been reared in- a, quiet, home
like way, surrounded by refinements
and comforts. Her 'home at . 612 . Merrl
mac street she shared with; her mother,
Mrs. Mary L. -Boweni and: two sisters. â¢
The exposurf^nas been a; blow to them,
but the family has gone to the support
of the stricken young woman.
L. S. Church, of the law firm K' of
Snook & Church has been retained in
her interest. . He held f, an f interview
with Miss. Bowen "this afternoon at the

To. cover the defalcation the clerk
was carrying balances from one set of
money orders to a. new lot. She was
playing the old game: of "robbing Pe
ter to pay Paul." Inevitable -detection
was the,*result. How long . she had
been able to conceal her peculation is
not definitely known. To. determine
this will require much back research
of the money order department's
books. It seems now that the period
runs upward of several months, y "As

Brown has no recourse from the girl,

to Postmaster T. T. Dargie
he is not liable for. Miss. Bowen's ..acts.
In explanation Dargie said to-day:
"Mrs. Brown was the clerk at sub
station Xo. 1. I did not know Miss
Bowen in this matter. She was named
by Mrs. Brown, who is responsible to
the Government. The Inspectors have
absolute charge of Miss Bowen's case.
It is out of my. hands, and I am not
authorized to say what action, will 'be
taken. Nothing- can be done before
Tuesday."
Just how far prosecution of Miss
BowÂ«n will go in the event restitution
is made is not settled.
How Miss Bowen came to enjoy the
confidence of Mrs. Brown and gain the
trust imposed jin her was the matter
of friendship of years, and' in this re-"
gard Deputy District Attorney Everett
J. Brown said for his mother this
evening: . _
Miss Bowen " has been in the postof flee for
nearly seven years and I do not believe that
she ever stole so much as a postage stamp. I
do not believe that shs took a cent of the
money she Is short for herself, but gave it. to
Baker, who, I believe, -must have hypnotized
her. When, my -mother succeeded in getting
the substation located, in what was then her
bul'.ding she gave Miss Bowen the position,
although she kept the main management of It.
Mis 3 Bowen was a young woman who wanted
something to do to support herself, and while
my motlu-t took th>; management of the station
she gave the salary, which was $35 a month.
to Miss . Uowen. Years went along and my
mother's friendship for the girl. Increased until
when she sold -the; building; a 'few months ago
she refused. to give vp \u25a0 the â¢ management of the
substation on account of- MissÃowen^. for fear
that sre would lose her position. - V
I \u25a0 talked i to \ my i mother ( about \u25a0 the - matter
last summer "and told her that there ' was no
use in â¢ her keeping the position now that she
had sold the building and she told me at that
time that she was only keeping it on account
of Miss Bowen.. as she did not want : her to be
put out... After she eold -the building she was
not even getting; the rent out of It/, which was
i'Â£l 50 a month. This wÂ«nt to the new owners,
while the salary went to ! the I clerk.' '
.IUFt how to -account for the relations be
tween Miss Bowen and Baker Is a hard matter.
She "says that-^he loaned; him the. money to
put into his business. Â«b=lieving. that he would
put' lt right back'and'thatls all'that I am
privileged to say. The postal authorities have
requested â¢ me. ti>- say nothing about . the post
oftice^part of this affair and ,1 want to give
them all the assistance In my power. '
' ' So far as i Miss \u25a0 Bowen's habits ' were con
cerned I understand they were -of the best.
Her mother says she was always In early -and
her manner .of. living and style of. dress were
such as would require no more ' than her sal
ary would pay for. â¢.; l believe she was' the
man's 1 dupe, ' : and through ' some : power \u25a0 he
"gained \u25a0 over her got her -confidence; to the ex
tent that she trusted him : lmpllcity. :He was
around the place a great deal and seemingly

.The methods used |by I the elrl to \u25a0 cover up
her defalcation is a matter that I cannot talk

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CORONA, Dec. . ,24.â Between the
hours of 3 and: 4 o'clock this morning:
burglars succeded in forcing an enT
trance to the postoffice and blew oft the
outer door of the safe with, dynamite.
The strongbox was , ruined . and every
thing in the vicinity, including ;the of
fice telephone, was wrecked, j A second
charge which had been placed against
theinner door of the safe failed to ex
plode because the fuse went out. The
burglars secured very little^ plunder.
A number of small stamp books and a
few dollars ln v money which they took
from, the cash drawer "comprises the
loot. \u25a0 .
-The tools used by the thieves were
taken from English & Granson's black
smith shop on Sixth street, which they
entered by forcing- a side door. ""â¢ The
tools, which ; consisted of a brace and
bit, several drills, and a punch, were
left in- the postofflce -.near a . gunny sack,
in â¢which, no .doubt, . they had been
wrapped. The postofflce clock^stopped
at 3:30 this morningr,Â«" which was the
time the explosion was heard by a
number of people. .; Some- excellent
clews have been obtained and there is
a reasonable hope that the rascals will
be caught.
Sheriff Coburn. of Riverside will ar
rive to-morrow, morning and; assist the
local authorities in the .search tor the
thieves. For some , time . Postmaster
Brown has taken the precaution :to
leave but little money in the safe over
nlgrht. It is evident from the manner
In "which the job was done that the
burglars were of', the -professional
variety.

MONDAY DECEMBER 25, 1905
THE CHEER OF CHRISTMAS.
OTHER holidays get perverted. The Fourth of July is not
always consecrated to patriotism, nor Decoration day to
solemn reflection and ascription to the, heroic dead." Even
the weekly Sabbath holiday is grotesquely wrenched from its pur
pose and made the occasion of unseemly indulgence and often riot.
But Christmas is the day of cheer. It is still the Merry Christmas
of all lands where it is kept. In its bright atmosphere of good
cheer and â¢ good will the sorrowing forget their woes, the dis
couraged their despair, the tired their weariness and the weak their
stumbling.
It brings into its illumination all the sentiment that is around
the lengthening da}'. The winter solstice is over. The shadow
that has been. upon morning and evening is shortening and the
blessed light is longer upon the earth. Where the snow lies and
plant life is locked in frost there is the promise of a resurrection
in which men shall be made glad again by the sight of the green
ihings growing, and throughout the physical environment there is
the promise of spring and summer to come, with their renewal of
iife and their seed time and harvest.
It is proper that this air of cheer and hope shall be associated,
as it is, with the great promises of spiritual renewal that were made
by the man of Nazareth, which teach that man is never to despair
nor be without hope. If the shadows are upon him there is a moral
winter solstice that he may pass into a longer day and more in
spiring light, if he will.
At this season no one is outlawed from that cheer which
belongs to the day. The purse strings of the rich are cut by human
sympathy and the man is rarely known who can take cheer him
self without having it heightened by the knowledge that all the
world is cheerful with him. Men find their own pleasures made
more enjoyable by what they have done to bring pleasure to others,
and so there is a great companionship that fellowships all classes
and conditions with each other and makes the day a merry Christ
mas.
It is a day of peace on earth and good will toward men.
Americans observe it to-day with especial grace and fervor because
their country has been instrumental in making peace and stopping
the most fearful war of all the ages. Wherever the day is observed
in its fullness and spirit the thoughts of men turn to this republic
and see over its name the Christian legend, "Blessed are the peace
makers.*' May we always deserve the ascription to which our Presi
dent has given us title. The holiday season finds our land favored
with plenty and peace and in a spirit of good will to all the world.
May it never break the peace of God among men, but. remain the
world's peacemaker rather than the world's peacebreaker.
We Californians are far separated from our kin and country
men. Deserts and mountains divide us from them, and while the
brief but lengthening day is here saluted at its beginning by the
incense of flowers that bloom unsmitten by winter they are shiver
ing in the blast and cold, yet the day's cheer is upon all.
In the abundance of our good feeling we wish that all the
world were here, or that upon it were the same winterless bloom
that garlands our Christmas and the balm that makes even poverty
lighter and hardship less and the day's cheer brighter. May friends
and families everywhere greet and hail in the spirit of the day and
its greater lessons nowhere be forgotten in the material enjoyment
and social joys that so become it.
POSSIBLE ECONOMY OF INSURANCE.
WORKINGMEN'S # insurance has been adopted as a part of
their business system by seventy American corporations,
all* of which are highly pleased with the results. Four
hundred more are seriously considering putting such a plan in
operation. The immense and extravagant expense accounts of our
insurance companies, if not promptly reduced, will probably foster
the growth of such method of insurance. To what -a large extent
retrenching of the cost of this protection is possible is forcibly
brought out in a paper written by Frank A. Vanderlip, formerly
assistant Secretary of the Treasury under Gage, and now vice
president of the National City Bank of New York? In his article,
which is published in the North American Review, he points out
that the expense of administration of workingmen's insurance in
Germany is only g per cent.
The introduction of the German system into this country is
not advocated by Vanderlip, but he believes the study of it would
be very useful to us for the purpose of getting suggestions of im
provement of our methods. Perhaps the chief thing for us to con
sider is the astonishingly small cost of German administration.
That small expense is not only astonishing when considered by
itself, but it makes appear absurdly unreasonable the comparative
extravagance of the expense accounts of American insurance. It
will be remembered that recent investigation showed that in one
of our big companies, making a specialty of industrial insurance,
the expense of administration actually exceeded the amount of
benefits returned to the people. Surely the American figures, when
confronted with the German evidence of what is honestly practi
cable, give proof of one or two alternatives â either a most greedy
selfishness on the part of the controllers, or an unpardonable lack
of financial ability to manage affairs of such great importance to
the laboring people's welfare. A slight difference might be tole
rated, but the enormity of the extent of an expense of over ioo
per cent when 9 per cent has been proved a possibility jrf economic
administration is enough to justify the struggling American work
ers to make an outcry for a better showing of returns for the hard
earned savings they invest in insurance.
In making his study Vanderlip held a very extensive cor
respondence with firms and corporations both in Germany and in
this country. The Germans, while pleased with their own system,
did not advise it for America, as they thought we were* naturally
too individualistic to be suited by their method of semi-governr
mental insurance. The American correspondence showed that the
corporations which had adopted some plan of insuring their em
ployes found it desirable, not merely from philanthropic considera
tions, but as an enlightened business policy, -inducing permanency
of employes, raising the standard of work and workmen, and pre
venting the waste of energy and savings in side speculations by
which the workmen otherwise seek to provide for old age or
illness. ,

;THE SAN^FRANCISCO GALL; MONDAY,;; DECEMBER 25, iflOo,
OUR TRIUMPH OVER OLGA
A Little Story of the Christmas Spirit
J POISED my pencil above our Christ
mas list. "Well," I queried, "what
shall we give to Olga?" -
The young and beautiful and be- i
witching partner of my poverty clicked
her teeth together and thought
about it. V
"Well," she said slowly, "it seems to
me that we might give her handker
chiefs." I wrote it down.
"Handkerchiefs;" I repeated genially,
as If it were a settled thing.
"What do you thing about it?" con
tinued the missus, trying to involve me j
in an argument. I
"I think handkerchiefs," I answered. \
"And,'' concluded she, "a box of writ
ing paper." _â¢
"The very thing." I joyfully assented.
And I scribbled it down at once.
"You can give her the -writing pa- i
per.". announced the. head of the house
finally, "and I shall give her the hand
kerchiefs." " : ' . '
"The best possible arrangement tnat
could be made," I murmured. This
was some four Christmases ago. Olga,
our proposed donee, was worthy of
our gifts. We had run across her the
summer before in Hungary. There
she was doing the work of four girls
for the princely price of two dollars
and a half per month. We brought her
to America and paid her ten. Prior to
that, out of our limited Income, we
had been paying twenty. But now the
arrangement was highly satisfactory.
Olga was richer and so were we; we
saved ten dollars every month and
our Mercedes did not seem quite so far
away, after all. Olga was grateful
and very satisfactory. And If our
faces beamed with ,the Christmas
spirit when I gave her the writing, pa
per and Molly gave her the handker
chiefs I am quite sure that hers
beamed also; she must have felt that
it was, indeed, more blessed to receive
than. to give. | ;
"Jah,", she cried; "but I should write
so many letters! I should wipe ; mine
nose so many times! Jah. soch a
moch to. eeef .roe!" ..
Molly's mother and father came
around and my : father and mother
came around, and my aunts and Molly's
aunts, and Molly's friends and ;my
friends, and to all of them Olga glee
fully exhibited her Christmas favors. -
"Zee," she cried, "I should blow
mine nose like dees!" And she suited
the action to the word.
"Olga's very noisy with her toys,"
said Molly's father after this perform
ance.
OLGA'S FIRST GIFTS.
' Well, that was our first Christmas
with Olga and the . handkerchiefs and
paper and our gifts were ;the only
gifts that she received on that occa
sion, but as time went ;on Olga en
deared herself to all our relatives.
"Such aÂ» good girl !" they would cry,
while Molly and I dwelt upon her merits.
Virtue Is not always its sole reward. The
following Christmas we kept up the cus
tom, of making presents to our Hungarian
honey, as we called her. â¢ This time we
arranged Olga's gifts after this fashion:
Molly presented writing paper.
I presented handkerchiefs.
"It is very nice," Olga said soberly
when we handed f out the goods. She
paused a bit uncertainly. V -\u25a0,
"Some .day," she : said, brightening . up,
"maybe for Chreestmas some one geef
me dollar. Soâ " . .
She was interrupted jby the advent , of
Molly's parents. They were loaded down
with presents. , The ; first ' thing (they .did
was to charge down upon Olga. s ~
"Olga,'.' said Molly's mother, "you , were
so delighted . last year at what you got
that I have brought you this." She passed
over abox. Molly's father, -with the em
barrassment \ under '; which ,; man ,' labors
when he I gives â¢ away presents that his
wife has bought, \ produced another box.
He thrust ithastily into Olga's hands.- ,
"M'ry Christmas," he- mumbled,,, and
backed out. I, heard Olga breathe softly
to herself. . \u0084/\u25a0' ; .
"Maybe it should be a dollar," she was
whispering. ; But : she '} was mistaken. ; Mol
ly's : father, had brought her: a . fine box of
writing paperâ more box ; than pap~er, by
the .way ; ' and ': Molly^s "\u25a0" mother. . had. shed
some handkerchiefs upon^ her ""', like a
Christmas benediction. .". : Olga accepted
these ; blessings silently. Just as \u25a0it was
all over. my. father i and '\u25a0 mother ; turned
up." Olga, thinking that , she saw; dollars
In their beaming faces,; turned expectant
ly to them.". , But they ; had come empty

And so had my aunts,* it seemed.": :
"Next Christmas," â¢though,'.',^ ,they . told
us, "we will V give | Olga\ something, j too."
But Christmas - and the Christmas holi

dees side, get seefnty-fife, jah." This was
but the beginning. Olga was no short
sport. All through the year she- pleaded
with us for our conversion, as a far. off
missionary might with a refractory Hot
tentot. And finally the third , Christmas
came around. .
"We'll have to give her money" I whis
pered to my better half.
"Nothing of the sort" bridled she; "it
will only spoil 'her. What we give her is
plenty good enough."
"What is it to be this time?" I asked.
"The same," said Molly.
"No," I cried, "we'd better not. Some
one else will be doing the same thing.
Remember last year." '
"It is last year that. l'm remembering,"
she answered, "and that's just the rea
son why. The others remember, too.
And this .time nobody will give her paper
and handkerchiefs. 'And we're going to.
They are' nice presents, arid Olga uses
them. ShÂ£ : writes a "good deal."
, "That's true," I assented, "and she;
blows a Jot. too. , Well. 'let it. go." '
i It went! But on this third Christmas, in
I order not to evoke any unusual, discussion
I with Olga as to the propriety, of financial
offerings, we agreed that we would wait
until Molly's parents " and mine and my
aunts should all get In, and then that all
the presents should be handed to Olga'
at once, in bewildering array. We waited.
! We put ours - "on a chair and arranged
! that the others should go on top of them.
i It was to be Olga's little Christmas pile.
"Well, said Molly's mother, coming In,
"I just knew that no. one would be giving
Olga handkerchiefs and paper after our
mistake of last year, so we just brought
them along this time again, so that poor
Olga would riot miss the gifts she likes so
much." They laid their presents on the
chair. Then my mother and father ar
rived. : *
"After the double-up that occurred
last Christmas," they announced, "we
thought â " They laid handkerchiefs
and paper "on the chair. My aunts
came in. .* . â¢\u25a0
"Did you bring handkerchiefs and
paper for Olga?" I genially inquired.
"Yes," they answered doubtfully, "did
anybody else?" . .
"Thank heaven!" cried Mollle and
myself, throwing our youthful figures
into ecstasy of delight; "Olga will have
at least one box of paper and one box
of handkerchiefs. We were . so afraid,"
we added, "that she wouldn't."
ANGER SEIZES OLGA.
Olga was brought in.. She set to
work upon her little pile. May be dol
lars," 1 heard her whisper. For she
had labored -with us for so long. At
the end of three minutes I saw her, out
of the corner of my eye, turn swiftly,
and walk stiffly back into the kitchen,,
empty handed. I could hear her,
through closed doors, slowly, j but de-.
terniinedly, tearing the furniture apart.
Back in the room. where we were pan
demonium reigned. for a short space of
time.
| Our guests glanced upon : the "< chair.
"Why. did you give her â " ventured
"Whyâ 'why â " gasped , another.
"Whyâ" feebly:said a third.
','There are enough letter, sheets
here," said my father, "for fifty breach
of promise cases." '
"There are enough handkerchiefs,"
said Molly's parent, going him one bet
ter, "for one good : cold in. the: head."
Well, we left them on the chair. There
was nothlngelse to do. "Olga will come
and get them after : a while," Molly ex
plained. \u25a0 j '- ; \u25a0 \u25a0.-.' v
But Olga did not come and. get them.
She left them there all that day, all that
week: Finally-; Molly -. took the initiative
and carried .them, ... chair . and \ all, Into
Olga's bedroom . while V; Olga ',was :â¢\u25a0â¢: down

inactivity into, little bits ;of pieces. One

"What's the matter with' this drawer?".
I cried. Just then it came open, with; a

"I took ; Molly f by^thVphouideraJ^VMolly."
I said, "heretofore you've had your say
about Christmas presents, haven't you?
Well, now, I'll tell, you something. I'll
dictate the terms of peace. Next Christ
mas I'm going to arrange our presents
to Olga, the presents of your parents to
Olga, the presents of my parents to Olga,
the \u25a0 presents of my aunts to Olga. You
watch and see." . . .
It was fortunate for us that Olga was
not popular with the surrounding ser
vants. Most of them were Irish. If Olga
could hava really mixed in .she would
have been spoiled for. us as a servant.
But they said little to her and she said
little to them, and her information as to
Christmas presents was gathered from
their Christmas shouts across the lawns.
Olga was a; good servant to us, and I be
lieve that she was attached Jo us, for her
only grumbling time was Christmas time.
I made up my mind, however, that she
had grumbled once too often.
When I- Issued : my ultimatum referred
to "above Molly smiled. "What axe we all
to give Olga next year?" she-queried.
I lit a cigar. "Handkerchiefs," I snort
ed; ."writing paperâ that's what. You
wait and see." '
And the fourth Christmas came in time.
And,, under my leadership, my attacking
forces gathered in our little drawing
room. Each was provided with ammuni
tion adequate for all purposes.
"Call Olga," I commanded, much as an
other man might say, "Shoulderâ humph."'
Olga . was called with military precision.
We advanced upon her in double quick
time.
''Olga," we shouted deliriously, hold
ing out before us our wrapped up boxes
that we carried, "here, merry Christ
mas! Happy New Year! Hooray."
; Olga looked. She turned up her nose
In disdain. "You meannesses," she
cried, "to treat a poor girl like this. I
will not take none of them presents.
Hendkchefs," she exploded, "writin'
pepper. Bah."
I stepped up ahead of the ranks. "Do
I understand,. Olga," I said coldly, "that
you refuse these presents that we of
fer you?"
SPURXS THE PRESENTS.
"I ref-f-f-f-use 'em," she assented.
"I sp-p-pit upon 'em."
"Very well." I answered. I turned to
Molly's 'â¢ father.
: "Mr. Kriss Kingle," I cried to him,
"unlimber; open up that box." .
He opened it. In it there was noth
ing; that is, nothing much. Only a dol
lar bill; that's all. I seized it.
"I accept the gift that Olga spurns,"
I said. I made a signal with my hand
and suddenly all the boxes opened.
Alas, they were all innocent of paper
and handkerchiefs. -Three of them con
tained cheap, common,, ordinary one
dollar bills, as had the first one. Two
of them contained marked down two
dollar silver certificates. - Then I
opened mine. Mine was the' limit. It
contained one of the most disreputable
five-dollar notes that I have ever seen.
I think : probably a dozen people had
been "carrying it about in their pockets
for weeks and month. >
I looked ' at Olga. For minutes she
was paralyzed. Then she snivelled and
heldouther hand.
''I'll take the. presents," she remarked.
I , waved my hand. .
"Not one cent of Indemnity," I an
swered, "and we won't even buy.a.half
of Saghalian, Olga," I thundered; "go
and prepare, our holiday feast. We've
got 'our Christmas appetites on and are
hungry, as the'deuce." \u25a0 \u25a0,'. â¢
Two, days later Olga told Molly that
she was sorry; that she had > been" a
naughty girl, and that'next Christmas
she would be glad, to take anything-,
even .though it ' were, soiled writing pa
per/and handkerchiefs to correspond.
; But it, is the victor's; privilege. to be

wager that when she gets it she'llgo out

Now, then, children, sit down and don't
say anything unless you have something
to sayâ as so many of us grown people
doâ and we will have a nice little talk.
It Is almost Christmas day; and who is
It who comes then? Tbat'.s It; you are
right; It is Santa Claus. It Is funny how
you guessed my conundrum the very first
thing, isn't it? Yes, of course.
And what is It that Santa Claus brings
to yÂ£u? That's itâ presents. You hit it
right again; you are great guessers. That
is, he brings presents, except to the
poor little waifs and strays to whom no
body brings anything; and may the Lord
help them, for hone of the rest of us do
very much.
And to whom does Santa bring the most
presents? To the best little girls and
boys? I thought you would say that.
Did you say so because your papas and
mammas told you so? I thought that you
would say that you didâ so you see that
I am a great guesser, too.
; Now, I do not wish to say a word that
will cause you to think that your papas
and mammas are mistaken, for. of course,,
they know more than anybody; but, just
the same, I am going to tell you about tne
queer case of a little boy I once knew;
and perhaps you can understand it, but
I fio not. â¢ â¢ .
This little boy was almost the homeliest'
little boy that ever happened, and. of
course, he was ' not to blame for that.
But I do claim that he was very
much. to blame for exhibiting more kinds
of cussedness than any thirteen little
boys ought to possess if they expect to go
to heaven, as all little boys should. His
life was one long, shocking fight with al
most all the other little boys in town, and
in the few odd times when he was not
fighting he generally was engaged in do
ing something else that you would blush
just to hear mentioned. Oh. he was a
ringed, streaked and striped convict from
Badboyville, this bad little boy was.
Did Santa Claus bring this dreadful lit
tle boy any presents when Christmas
came? That's right; all speak up at once
and say that, of course, he did not. It Is
natural that you should think so after
what your papas and mammas have told
you, but all the same. It Is a surprla
ing fact that you are mistaken. He was
the worst boy in his school, and he sot
the most Christmas presents! Now, how
would you account, for that? It knocks
me! "
You ask if this is a true story? You
bet it is! How do I know? Well, it pains
me to confess : it, dear children, but Iâ
well, one might as well be honest, andâ
that isâ the fact is, I was that little boy.
I should not have told you this story,
dear children, if I had thought that you
would ask me how I knew; but it Is true,
and I never have understood it. and I do
not understand it, and I suppose that I
never will. It makes me wonder and won
der about Santa Claus. Does it affect
you in the same way? And. if not. how
would you account for such a case?.

has been received:
In many parts of the city thÂ«>re are vacant

you not, through the dally papers, ask the
people of Kan Francisco to gather their nas
turtium weds. R^-nd them to your headquarters,
and on a certain day have the school children
plant tliem ?
The league considers this an excellent

take up the work. If the people who cul
tivate nasturtiums will kindly collect the

On December 15 the following communi
cation was received in regard to the
threatening destructionâ or extermination
â of Xiacara (if such destruction or ex
termination is really threatened):
We ask your prompt and earnest co-opera
tion, as a member of the American Civic As
sociation, in the work that Is being done to
preserve Niagara Falls from destruction by
the power companies. President Roosevelt de
clared himSelf most unmistakably on this sub
ject to the officers of the association when
they visited him November 11. He believes
that "as California hai? given a great grove of
big trees to the nation, so New\ York should
give Niagara to the nation; but If New York
does not do so. then the American people must
step in and preserve Niagara.
When the President asked what we could do
to help hs said earnestly, "Get as many Intelli
gent persons and organizations as powlble to
write to their Senators and Congressmen, urg
ing international action to save Niagara."
We ask you. therefore, as an individual to
write at once to your two Senators and to your
Congressmen, asking each of them to become
Interested in this matter. If possible secure
similar action on the part of your friends and
neighbors, and also on the part of organiza
tions of various kinds, including your local
business bodies. Very truly yours,

SAN FRANCISCO
LAD IS MISSING
Disappearance jof Clarence E.
Close Prompts Inquiry as
to Present Whereabouts
SEATTLE, Dec. 24.â F. M. Gray, local
agent for the Bowers Rubber Company,
with offices at 75* West .Washington
street, has been asked to make a search
for Clarence E. Close, a seventeen-year
old San Francisco boy, who disappeared
at Everett December 2 and is believed by
many persons to have been shanghaied
and taken aboard some foreign vessel.
According to information received by Mr.
Gray, the lad "is from a well-known San
Francisco family. ' Through the manager
for W; R. Grace Â«: Co., San Francisco
shipbuilders, a placet was secured for
young Close on board the steamship Ca
cique. He was to act as the captain's
cabin boy and be given a chance to work
himself up to a better position later.
The voyage constituted first a trip to
Puget Sound, then a voyage to South
America and possibly around Cape Horn
to New York. It was ah opportunity for
the boy to see the world, and after some
hesitancy the consent of his partnts was
secured. â¢ .. ' â¢
The steamship went from San Fran
cisco to Seattle and later to Everett,
where it remained for three days loading
lumber. On the night of December 2 the
boy went ashore at Everett with the first
assistant steward, who prevailed upon
him to attend a dance. The boy remained
until 11 o'clock and announced that he
would return to the vessel. From â¢\u25a0 that
hour all trace of him was lost.
The boy had written to his mother say
ing 'he was well satisfied with his posi
tion, was having a good time and being
treated nicely. ,His clothing was all
aboard the ship and there seems- to be no
ground for believing that he deserted.
Close's parents have concluded that their
son was either shanghaied, fell overboard
and was drowned .or was injured and
taken away by strangers.
The police at Everett were notified, but
they reported that no trace of the lad
could be found. Mr. Gray will go to Ev
erett' to make additional search.

"R-E-X-R-A-D-I-O'-S" MULTITUDES of suc-
cessfully treated patients of 19U5 are now
chanting a CHRISTMAS CAROL of Joyful
gratitude for the marvelous benefits obtained
by his DRLGLESS H'D RADIUM treatment.
To enable the VIZAF and e?ICK readers of
these lints to JOIN in their JUBILANT
thanksgiving, Itexradio now offersthem (during
this festive season) his peerless treatment ai
ONE-HALF his usual moderate FEE, thus
suiting persons of SMALLEST MEANS. Tin*
very best CHRISTMAS or NEW YEARS
GIFT you can present to your loved SICK
and DEAF relatives is a QUICK CURE by
this "inexpensive" treatment, which has been
marvelously successful* in about 95 per cent
of all alleged INCURABLE cases of DEAF-
NESS and DISEASES, which others had
GIVEN UP as H-O-P-E-L-E-S-S. C. Engleke
of the CAL. DEMOKRAT further testilies:
"My friend with the 19 years' dreadful in-
flammatory RHEUMATISM, who was practi-
cally HELPLESS and UNABLE to RISE
from a chair or STAND for so long a time
(whoe* case was reported last Sunday), in-
etantly ROSE. STOOD, and RAISED her fttt
over 36 Inches high (ALL till then IMPOSSI-
BLE), 'continues' to progress satisfactorily,
and considers the 6ever&! hundred dollars the
gave Rexradio to be a SPLENDID INVEST-
MENT. He has cured MANY equally
HOPELESS cases of chronic, acute, DE-
FORMING, and disabling RHEUMATISM,
s-ls-j PARALYSIS and LOCOMOTOU
ATAXIA. 'each' being INSTANTLY able for
â¢first time' to WALK, RUN and LEAP. I
K-N-O-W. for I was a WITNESS. My
own INSTANT cure of 20 years' distressing
RHEUMATISM has now L-A-S-T-E-D ONE
HUNDRED and FORTY-THREE DAYS, and
I etill can vigorously RUN and LEAP. The
totally DEAF usually HEAR a 'distant'
WHISPER ty a '3 seconds' ' treatment, as

ing numbers of our very FOREMOST citi-
zens. CITY and COUNTY ATTORNEY

Market, and many others (whose addresses
you can have), who were once as STRONG
SKEPTICS as myself, have testified over
their denatures that they have WITNESSED
numerous remarkably successful treatments
of total DEAFNESS and various supposed
INCURABLIS maladies. The ENORMOUS
abdominal PftOPSY case I named last Sun-
day has, by reduction' of the dropsy, LOST
HIXTEEN POUNDS in weight the past week
and the abdomen is now perfectly 'natural'
in size. The 21 years DIPSOMANIAC who
cou!d NEVER pass the door of a saloon, has
not once touched liquor the past 7 days. He
and his family are "overjoyed. 1 E. AE-
TON, 12G5 Clay gt., Oakland, with very seri-
ous ERIGHT'S disease, said yesterday: "I
feel a NEW man and almost well, after only
5 treatments.' His wife's totally DEAF ear
instantly heard a WHISPER at 25 feet, also
her NEURALGIA ceased in a MOMENT.
One of our "most" prominent men in th-j
CITY GOVERNMENT last week hid hiÂ«
DEAF ear made to hear well at nearly SO
feet. Rexradfo 'communicated' his 'mys-
terious" healing power to 2 persons, and
t-ach went and 'successfully' treated their
eick friends. A greatly bloated (DROPSY)
!*g was reduced to normal pize. A dangerous
case of HEART disease instantly lost all
PAINS, ani the DEATS became REGULAR.
A DEAF MUTE heard and epeke well. Now,
I uaert en my honor that I K-N-O-W these
to be F-A-C-T-S absolutely beywid all DIS-
PUTE and DOUBT, and this I can and will

iIAM SEA BIRDS ARE
FAST DISAFPEARLXG
\u25a0 Â« No one knows better than the sailor or
the ehore hunter how the eea birds may
â¢ be exterminated and no one better than
tfie Indian or the trapper of the deep
â¢woods how sometimes the wildest and
most abundant land species may disap
pear. The wonderful great auk. or gare
*' fowl, has, within the memory of men
now living, bfen hunted from the face of
.The earth so that Its skins and egg>- are
now worth their weight in gold. Practi
cally the beautiful wild pigeon, which
once darkened the ekies with its vast
and cloud-like flight, has met the same
fe.ie, though Email colonies of It in remote
\u25a0 pots undoubtedly still exist. The eastern
pinnated grouse !Â» alao practically extinct.
In the Chatham Islands alone, in the Pa-
Iciftc, seventeen species of birds have be
come extinct.
' On all the islands of the sea and at all
lhÂ© shore spots to which sea birds resort
the work of slaughter is being carried on
quite relentlessly. Largely for purely hu
mane reasons and incidentally in the in
terest of science the National Association
of Audubon Societies is engaged in the
work of trying to save the sea birds
from extermination. Several species arc
being systematically destroyed for their
feathers. Fashion, of course, does not care
whether these beautiful creatures arc ex
terminated or not. The scarcer they be
come up to the point of their actual dis
appearance the greater are the prices
realized for their feathers and the deeper
th<j joy taken by the wearer of the orna
ment. And when at last they are all gone
â why, there will bo another of . God'Â»
crcat'.ire* to put through the same pro
cess.
Thla assopiatftn has forty wardens
Ku&rding some of the key colonies of
these sea birds. This may guarantee
them from total destruction at present,
but docs not insure the maintenance of
the birds of the species in question in
Â«uch numbers as to render their preserva
tion sure. Instead of forty wardens the
tociely ought to have 390.â New York
ORPHEUM ROAD
SHOW GLITTERS
Five of Turns Presented by
Traveling* Aggregation Are
Among Best of Their Class
SUPERIOR VAUDEVILLE
Many First-Class Attractions
for Patrons of the Popu
lar Home of Variety
Tha Orpheum Road Show opened yes
terday afternoon with much "a-claw,"
as Teddy Webb says. It glitters hard
where it does glitter, and Edgar Bixley
does the rest. Five turns the best of
their class, two fair to middling and one,
for luck, the worst, make up this de luxe
edition of vaudeville. And it glitters
where it does glitter.
Perhaps the Kloes sisters still do most
of the glittering, as they Btill furnish
the thrills of the bill. And they do it
with one hand behind them, except when
the black-haired Kloes reaches out both,
of hers, and the other two use them, or
rather, the arms, for horizontal bars. She
Is hanging from the chandelier by one
foot at the time, which doubtless makes
it easier. Then, the sisters cannot weigh
more than 130 pounds apiece. These
chiefly amuse themselves by lounging
around on the atmosphere, hung up by
one arm- The act is as deft as it is
daring and the acme of grace.
The next best Is that of Merlan's dogs,
that have also been seen here before.
They will be as welcome again, Merian's
dogs are the Mansfield's Mrs. Fiske of
dogdom. It will be remembered. They
are a stock company of thirteen canines
and they play a problem drama entitled
"A Faithless Woman."
It is not a play for the young person.
Hennele. enacted with much spirit by
Miss Fido, is almost human In her de
pravity, and Seppl, her lover, essayed
with marked distinction by Herr Fillax,
is a rcsrular Don Juan. Tbfl Injured hus
band, Pratzenbauer, is played as before
by Mr. Bobby, and the policeman by Mr.
Pino. They didn't miss a cue, these
canines. The scene Is remarkably pretty,
and It Is just as comical as before to see
the giant Merian come into the baby city
when the act is over. He is "-behind" be
fore, where all good stage managers
should be.
The Colonial Septette again Is entirely
new, and as seasonably pretty as it Is
nÂ«w. The act Is a musical one, but given
with picture and an engaging dramatic
flavor. The flavor is colonial, and the
seven clever folk of the septette give it
full point. They have the prettiest of the
scenery the Road Show runs to this
year, with the road through a Virginia
forestâ with the tenor gentleman pretty
busy therein, and the drawing-room of a
colonial mansion. It Is when they reach
the drawing-room that the patched and
curled ladles three, and the male quar
tette begin to play. They play anything,
mostly- long-distance trumpets, horns,
strings, cornets and all takingly. They
end up with a very fetching edition of the
Floradora sextette. Not colonial? But it
should have been.
Campbell and Johnson begin the bill.
They cycle about as well as It can be
done, on large wheels, email wheels, one
wheel and the grindstone. But Campbell
and Johnson call themselves "comedy"
acrobats, and they are Just that. Even
Mr. Rosner laughed. He laughed when
Campbellâ or Johnson?â turned a somer
sault oyer his head right into the audi
ence. He says, though, that he is going
to wear an apple to-night.
The Ford brothers and sisters are also
new. In detachments they have been here
before â the two sisters last year. The
brothers were of the chief lights of the
Dockstadter Minstrels. The Fords dance,
none better. They are "clog" artists, and
Saurets at the heel and toe.
Then there are Jules and Ella Garrison,
with a turn in "An Ancient Roman" that
Is co good that it ought to be better.
There Is an "Aida" scene at the first that
Is peculiarly splendiferous for vaudeville,
and the dramatized- super Is a distinct
feature. A Cook's tourist gets lost in one
of the pyramids and meets the shade of
Marc Antony on the still hunt for new
Jokes. Marc presently summons his ar
my, and the super comes to his own. The
act needs cutting and smartening, but it
Is full of good stuff. Winona Winter, the
"Alabama Blossom," sings. She looks
prettier. But for anything but a road
show this pretty lass Is good vaudeville,
and her ventriloquial act is distinctly
novel and clever. As It is Christmas, I'll
make Mr. Edgar Blxley a present of my
silence. Some of the other people liked
him.

REPUBLIC OP POLAXD
COMING IN NEAR FUTURE
Dismembered Poland presents much
more of a problem than independent Po
land possibly could, on account of its rev
olutionary propaganda and its growing
strength. The Poles are more numerous
than ever before and their increase 13
rapid. Furthermore there now exists
among all classes of Polesâ nobles, clergy,
bourgeoisie and peasantsâ a sympathy and
sen^e of unity unprecedented in the Pol
ish history- Even with the Polish social
ists the first aim is to secure Polish inde
pendence. All three empires among which
Poland was divided have mistrusted one
another because of their common guilt
Each lives In fear of encroachment. Es
pecially are Austria and Russia suspi
cious of Germany because of the well
known German ambition for the Drang
nach Osten.
From all these considerations the Poles
reason that Austria will take the first
step toward the restoration of Polish in
dependence, for the sake of having a
buffer state to serve as a safeguard
against encroachment. It is expected that
Austria will first propose the move to
Russia and that the two will then bring
diplomatic Influence to bear on Germany,
with the result that each power will re
store Its share of Poland, to reduce thÂ©
number of Its domestic and frontier prob-
How soon the Polea expect this hope to
be realized depends on the extent of the
disasters to Russia in the Far East, on
the Polish political influence In Austria
and on the continued isolation of Ger
many. Even a Balkan crisis involving
two 'or more of the great powers would
be to Poland's advantage. In the mean
while the Poles are making every effort
to avail themselves of their approaching
opportunities. They are conscious as a
people that they are fitted for self-gov
ornment and Independence as they never
were before, because they have learned
the lessons of modern clvilzation.

BLUNTS REEF LIGHTSHIP
PARTS FROM MOORING
GALES CAUSE HER TO LOSE ANCHOR
Compelled to Come
Into Port for
Vessel Met With a
Similar Accident
Rprpntlv
Lightship No. 83, stationed off Cape
Mendocino, came into port yesterday, hav
ing parted her moorings at that point.
This is the second time that this vessel
has been In this' port within thirty days
under, similar circumstances. This is due
to the fact that terrific storms, \ strong
winds and high seas have been sweeping
along that part of the coast recently.
The vessel's anchorage Is at* a point
known as Blunts Reef, where, she gets
full benefit of all the fury of the ele
ments. When she is there, she. is held In
position by an immense mushroom an
chor, the largest of its kfnd on this coast.
Attached to this are two heavy chains
which keep the vessel well in place in
any usual rough weather, . but when a
storm of unusual violence comes up, she
parts her moorings and has to put to sea.
She will remain in port until the chains
can be picked up from the anchor, .and
will then return to her post. She has
gone over to Oakland to tie up until she
starts back to the reef.
Glvea Acrobatic Performance.
The Scottish cook of the British ship Elgin
shire gave en informal exhibition of prowess,
strength and acrobatic feats on' Mission-street
\u25a0wharf yesterday morning much to.the.amuse
ment of a big crowd of water front strollers.
The elver of the entertainment had . bean up
town celebrating the advent of Christmas tide
In proper shape. He arrived back to his ship
"ripe and rosy." As he vr&s about to board
the vessel he suddenly changed hie mind Just
at the foot of the gangplank. No amount of
persuasion by the sailors on the ship could in
duce htm to come on board. Personal force
was then attempted, but the cook was too
much for the whole bunch and when they laid
hands on him he sent them flying in all direc
tions When he found he was master of the
situation he pulled off his coat and 6hirt, leav
ing him stripped to the waist. He then kicked
off his shoes and began going through all sorts
of acrobatic feats and Sandow performances.
Whenever any attempt was made to put a
stop to his proceedings he threatened to "do
up" the whole of the police force and if neo
essary the entire British contingent of citizens

Walks Into Bar to Save Dos;.
Frank McLaughlln, who lives at 103 Van
Ness avenue, thinks aÂ» much of his dog as he
thinks of a Christian, and yesterday to prove
this he walked into the bay to save his dog,
which had got mixed up in 6ome drift while he
was swimming off Folsom-street wharf. Mc-
Laughlin brought his dog, which is a fine
water spaniel, to the water front yesterday to
give him a plunge In the bay. The dog swam
and played pranks and tricks In the water for
a while, and finally swam up against a lot of
driftwood. His owner, who had been enjoying
"Christmas cheer," became Imbued with the
fact that the dog was a "goner," and without
hesitation stepped off from the pontoon and
attempted to walk to the assistance of the ca
nine. In another minute McLaughlln was
floundering around and yelling for help. Two
or threV lusty longshoremen ran to his rescue
and hauled him on to the dock, where he
looked like a : "drowned rat." The dog In the
meantime landed of his own accord, and mas
ter and beast went dripping up . the street to
the Harbor Emergency Hospital. There Dr.
Reuben Hill applied restoratives to McLa.ugh
lin and then put him to bed. As McLaughlln
came back to his senses he said: "I've saved
my dog and I feel as good as though I had
saved a Christian."

MYSTERY VEILS
WOMAN'S DEATH
Lifeless Body of Mrs. Young
Is Pound in a Kooni With
Gas Escaping* From Stove
HEAET IS VERY WEAK
Coroners Deputy Says Dead
ly Fumes Ended Life, but
Doctor Differs From Him
.Mystery shrouds the death of Mrs. A.
L. Young, a well-to-do widow, who was
found dead yesterday afternoon in her
room, 506 Hyde street. There was a
strong odor of gas In the room, coming
from a small stove, which was lighted.
A. S. Howe, landlord of the house, says
tho woman was a sufferer from heart
trouble and death was due to natural
causes. His opinion is shared by Dr. A.
B. McGill who was called In. but the offi
cials at the Coroner's office, as well as
the police, are of the opinion that death
was due to asphyxiation and an investi
gation is in progress.
Mrs. Young's lifeless body was found
shortly after 2 o'clock by Howe. The
woman announced in the morning that
she intended to do some Christmas shop
ping and, not seeing her leave the room,
Howe became alarmed and madÂ© an in
vestigation. .The door of the room was
locked, but. looking through the- keyhole,
he saw the woman sitting on a chair,
fully dressed with the exception of her
coat and hat.
Howe broke open the door and found
the woman was dead. He noticed the
gas stove lit and also detected a faint
odor of gas- that was escaping from a
small rubber tube. He says very little
gas was escaping and this could not have
pfoduced death.
Dr. McGlll was summoned. Immediately
and, after examining the remains, he too
came to the conclusion Jthat death was
the result of heart disease and not car
bon monoxide. The woman had suffered
for years with heart trouble and asthma
and had lately complained of feeling very
bad.
' The. Morgue- officials were notified and
Deputy Brown went for the remains.
ACter a close examination he at once
stated the woman had died as a result of
gas poisoning. He declared she had been
dead for at least ten hours and scoffed
at the Idea that an affliction of the heart
was the cause of her sudden demise-
The matter was reported to Captain of
Detectives â¢ Burnett and he detailed De
tective, Armstrong on the case. Arm
strong visited the house and made a
careful survey of the premises. He ex
amined the gas stove and noted the
leakage and he, too. thinks Mrs. Young
was Doisoned by the deadly fumes.
The woman evidently passed away
without making even the slightest sort of
a struggle. . It seems only reasonable
that had her death been the result of
accidental asphyxiation, she would sure
ly have made an effort to save her life,
for she could have discovered that some
thing was wrong when she smelled the
gas. But there was no sign of a struggle,
the woman's position indicating that she
had met her \ death calmly while seated
in a chair, apparently ready to leave the
house.
Mrs. Youns came from Reno, Nevada,
about two weeks ago. She was a woman
of comfortable circumstances and had
two sons living in Nevada, both of whom
are well to do. They were advised of her
death last â¢night and will take charge
of the remains, which have been removed
to a private undertaking establishment.
Injured by a Car.
Clarence Greenwood, who lives at 14
Duboce avenue, was knocked down by
a car at Sixteenth and Mission streets
last night and badly bruised. He was
taken to the Southern Pacific Hospital.
LABORER' STABBED. â N. Just, a laborer
employed by Gray Bros., was set upon and
stabbed several times at Keamy and Paclflo
streets last night. He was much under thÂ«
influence of liquor and could not give a de
scription of his assailant?. He is not seriously
injured.
FALLS OFF DOCK. â John Small, a long
shoreman, fell oft the wharf at the foot of
Third street last night while intoxicated. Hs
was tlshed out and treated at tho Potrero
Emergency Hospital. He suffered no serious
results from his ducking.
The - Bouth Side life saving: crew renewed
search yesterday for the bodies of two fisher
men drowned the day before, but could not find
any trace of them. G. Murray, Deputy Sheriff
of Ban Mateo County, who was an Â«ye witness
of the accident, recovered the engine of the
boat. . v is:

TAKES HIS MAN
AFTER A FIGHT
Plucky San Luis Obispo Mar
shal Captures Bold Thief
Who Tried to Murder Him
STKUGGLE IN DAEKNESS
Weapon of Desperado Does
Not Prevent Brave Officer
From Doing His Duty
Special Dispatch to Th* Call.
SAN LUIS OBISPO, Dec. 24. â Whllo
a force of police officers and a posse of
armed citizens were scouring the city
for a man who had stolen two coats
and attempted to burglarize a hardware
store. City Marshal William G. John
son arrested him in a dark, lonely spot
on the outskirts of the city in a sen
sational manner. The Marshal sepa
rated himself from the posse and after
a long search located the man. As thÂ«
Marshal hailed the fellow and stated
his business 'there was a flash of a re
volver and a bullet sped by the officer's
head. With a leap the officer was upon
the fellow and after a desperate strug
gle took the man to the County- Jail.
The man refuses to give his name. He
Is about 31 years of age. Th<* police
are of the opinion that he is a des
perado.
Some time prior to his arrest thÂ«
thief entered Humphrey's saloon, and
taking the coat and overcoat- of Guerro
Bolton out of the billiard-room, left the
house by the rear door. In the mean
time Bolton, who waa playing billiards,
missed his coats and notified tba at
tendant. C. H. Brown. The two went
to the back door, where they met thÂ«
thf if. He was boldly donning; the
stolen garments. On being asked what
he meant by such actions, the burglar
replied, "None of your business," and
pointing a revolver at his Interrogators,
gracefully retreated In true desperado
style.
An alarm was raised and a posse
of citizens started in pursuit. Within
half an hour John Minor discovered the
man making an attempt to burglarize
the store of C. H. Reed & Co. When
the robber saw that he was discovered
he opened fire upon Minor and ran
away. Within a short time, thanks to
Marshal Johnson's bravery, he was a
prisoner.
The greatest excitement prevailed in
the city and there, was talk of lynching
tho man.

dicted the- modification of the \u25a0 phono
graph, which is now a reality.
The Literary Digest gives a transla
tion from La Nature. Paris, describing
the invention as follows:
"The phono-postal is an apparatus
intended to record and afterward re
produce the human voice with the aid
of a piece of cardboard of the size and
shape of a postal card.
"The advantages of the phono-postal'
are many. In these days of extended
tour-s there can be nothing more at
tractive than to put In one's automobile
or in a corner of one's bag this appa
ratus, which takes up no more room
than two or three boxes of letter paper.
By adding a few dozen cards prepared
for use as records we may, at each
stopping place, send to those at home
fresh and. rs we may say, vibrant news
of our Journey."
In makine P a phono-postal the sender
speaks into" the phonograph, a piece of
prepared cardboard taking the place of
the customary wax cylinder.
The diaphragm of the instrument has
a sapphire point that traces the record
in a sensitive layer of what is called
"sonorine." spread over the surface of
the card. The essence of the invention
lies in the composition of this sub
stance, -which, although easily spread
on a sheet of cardboard, possesses all
the advantages of the wax with which
the ordinary phonograph cylinders and
gramophone disks are covered. In ad
dition, sonorine is so hard that it will
safely bear the roughest handling that
it is likely to get In passing through
the malls.
The French writer says:
"The sounds are recorded in a spiral
beginning at the edge of the card and
growing continually smaller until the
last circle Is barely as large as a 10
centime piece. The groove made is so
hard that even the two postmarks are
not able to destroy more than a syl
lable or two. â¢ * â¢
"On one card there may easily be In
scribed seventy-five to eighty words,
which Is sufficient to give ample news.
"We should not forget that the> phono
card merely alms at fllline the same
place as the illustrated postal card.
"The phonographic correspondence
may be put on the side reserved for
the address, and this may be written
over the grooves traced by the record-
Ing diaphragm without the slightest
Interference with the reproduction of
the sounds."
The Invention has been introduced in
Paris.
Camera Seawn Is Open.
One of the surest signs that the fall
has come to the city is the presence in
the main' thoroughfares and in the
parks on Sundays of a small army of
amateur photographers who are clearly
from the suburban towns around New
York. As a rule these camera fiends
travel in groups of varying- sire. Often
one* of these gToupswill consist of a
.fatherland \u25a0 mother and one or two
small children, while now and again
the stroller will see two or three men
together and occasionally, a pair of
lovers.
They take pictures of all sorts of
things, but famous buildings of the
town are their favorite subjects. Just
how many times the City Hall is
'.'snapped" In the course of the fall
months it would bo difficult to ascer
tain. Next to that structure. the fa
vorite Is the Flatiron building-, of
\u25a0which -there must be many weird pho
tographs in suburban albums. The
Metropolitan Opera-house comes next
in favor, and after that the tall tower
of the Times building" Is a winner. Of
course , the ; parks come in . for their
share of this invasion. But since the
rural photographer lives among-, the
trees and fields most of the time, he
prefers, when he comes to town, , to'
preserve: on "his plates or films some
record of- what really belongs to "the
city. â New York Press.

Banning Too Much to Title*.
An . American Journalist return trig
after an absence of some years
comments upon the profuse application of
titles which i 3 becoming frequent In thla

modern one. Daniel Webster In hla lii-Â»-
time was never spoken of aa "Senator"

ster. Nowadays, however, it la Invariably
"Senator" this and that, and almost
everybody has some kind of a handle to
his name. Thus wÂ« have "Forecaster"

on. If this kind of thina: keeps on we

CHRISTMAS HANDICAP AT INGLESIDE
PISTOL EXPERTS
IN RARE FORM
Trego and -Braniiagan Make
the Highest Scores of
Year at Shell Mound
BLASSE SHOOTS WELL
Captures the Siebe Medal
in Rifle Competition for
Fourth Consecutive Time
The Christmas holday kept many
marksmen from the rifle ranges yes
terday. The attendance at Shell
Mound Park was good, but not up to
the average. Some fine scores were
made on the pistol and bullsoye tar
gets. In the pistol competition of the
o-^Â»Â«ien date Ciuo J. li. i'reÂ«^o and A.
J. iirannagun made the luguest scores
of the year, with a record of as rings
eÂ«icii out of a possiole 100. Each ot
these contestants also made rive scores
extra that counted more tnan HO rings.
This is the best shooting done on tne
pistol competitions tor a long time. F.
V. Kington, on tiie same target, made
a score or I*o. In the same club Mar
tin F. Blasse won the Sieoe medal in
the' rifle competition tor the fourth
consecutive time, being something un
precedented in the history of this im
portant trophy.
Captain John E. Klein, a veteran at
rifle shooting, carried off the honors
at the bullseye target of the Germania
Club contest. So close was his ahot to
the center of the target that to an ob
server it appeared a true center, but
the measuring machine placed it .058
of an inch from the middle of the bulls
eye. This is among the best bullseyes
that have been scored for the year.
Benjamin Jonas won tne Siebe medal
in the Germania Schuetzen Club for
making tiie best three centers of the
year. The bullseyes made measured
IM7 points. 277 and 327: total 851.
John de Wit was high man in the
monthly medal competition of the
Norddeutscher Schuetzen Club with 217
rings, with Herman Huber a close sec
ond, who scored 212.
An interesting match took place be
tween Milton Levy and Eugene New
bauer for Christmas turkeys. As the
marksmen were compelled to use the
Springfield rifle and not being accus
tomed to its "kick." the scores made
were not up to their usual average.
'AÂ»ie regulation â¢ military target was
used in the contest, and each con
testant fired ten shots. M- Levy scored
S9 points and E. Newbauer 41.

Dr. Clark's greyhound, . L. L. C, waa
unfortunate in having a severe test In the
semi-final round yesterday at Ingleside .
Coursing Park, as the Stockton dog was
showing great speed and would /have
given Carlow Boy, \he winner of.' the
Champion Stake, a hard run. The trial
proved^too long, so the trainer of "the
runner-up wisely withdrew. his charge and
first money went to L. Corder's Carlow
Boy by default. , .
The Eastern dogs showed to advantage
during the day's running. D.K. Cart
ter's Keeley's Malt, ran up to her Eastern
form and decisively bea^ a fast field in
the reserve event. Cranberry Sauce went
into the final of the unfinished reserve
stake, being beaten for. first honors by
La Rosa.
E. Preston's Real Pasha, which figured
to have a chance for stake honors,
showed as much speed as a snail in : the
first race in the unfinished reserve event
against Shotgun. Dogs from this kennel
appear to be versatile performers.

Two 'noted English players," Captain
Archibald Seymour and Captain^Bulke
ley Johnson, both of the famous Scots
Greys, were in the saddle. With Messrs.
Driscoll and Clagstone as team mates
they held their opponents level until
well into the last period.
The Reds then : put on a burst of
speed and scored two goaJs before the
bell signaled the end of the game. The
final score was" 5 to 3 in their favor.
For a game . so early in the-: season
there was some desperate riding,' .Cap
tain Seymour especially gamely taking
chances with-light ponies in riding oft
heavier opponents. He is a left-handed
player. The field was safe, but v not as
fast as it will be later , in the season.
Captain Johnson scored In the first
inning for the Whites. Walter Hobart

Neither, side scored in the second

PLAYERS FAIL
TO GIVE ODDS
Tennis Handicaps Prove
Too Heavy for the Cracks
to Concede Successfully
TWO TEAMS NOW REMAIN
Fuller and Warner, With
Kuehn and Murphy ,- Reach
the Finals on Club Courts
The sixth of a series of handicap tennis
doubles tournaments for the Directors'
i cups, played on the California Club's
I courts, proved an interesting event. As a
result of the unusually large odds allow
ed the Doorer teams they succeeded In
downing the cracks playing from behind
scratch. .
Play was completed to the finals, the
successful teams being George Fuller
and Moulten Warner and Charles Kuehn
and William Murphy. The former played
from the 3-6 mark and the latter were at
15 3-6. They will meet in the finals at 11
o'clock this morning. . .
There were twelve teams in the compe
tition, two changes being, made just be
fore play commenced. George Janes and
i George Busch were substituted for Fuller
and Steinfeld. The new team waa placed
;on the owe 30 3-6 mark. Fuller took Mills'
1 place and. played with Warner. The han-
I dicap was not changed.
Murphy and Kuehn were undoubtedly
under-estimated by the committee in
charge of the handicapping. They won
both their matches almost without effort.
Fuller and Warner had an easy time in
their first match, but had a close call in
the scmi-nnals. They allowed & Vogel
and B. Webster odds of 15 3-6 and/won in
straight sets. In the scml-flnals they were
opposed to Dr. Lovegrove and T. D.
Black. The latter received 3-6 and the
odds proved about right.
Lovegrove and Biaek won the first set.
but the next two went to their opponents
by a narrow margin.
The other semi-nnal match brought to
gether the Long brothers and Murphy
and Kuehn. . The Longs played good ten
; nis ir their first two matches, but the
odds they were called upon to allow Mur
i phy and Kuehn were unquestionably too
large. The latter, both play lair tenni3
and the Lous ' brothers could make no
headway.
In the 'preliminary round H. Rolfe and
H. Schmidt, another of ihe teams play-
Ing from Z0 3-6 back of scratch, lost a
i hard-fought match. C. Smith and A. E.
Beyfuss, v. Ith 3-6, pulled out the match
after losii.K.the first set.
A. Kenyon and H. Gabriel, with odds of

tater-believed his remarks Justified him
'in 'warning Hanford to desist. Ho
walked down the aisle, and. Interrupt
ing Hanford, told him he would have
to tone- down his remarks or he would
stop the meeting. Later the speaker
used the Russian language.

with the Russian language, did not in
terfere and the remainder, of the meet
ing was not interrupted.

Proves a Keen Contest
WINNERS SCORE TWICE
Albion Team Keeps Ball in
Territory of the Losers
Most of Second Period
In a lively and interesting game of As
sociation football played at Freeman's
Park, Golden Gate, yesterday, the Albion
Rovers beat the Independent* two goals
to one.
Neither club was represented by it 3
strongest eleven, the captains taking UM
opportunity afforded by a game that wa3
not for the league championship to try
some new men. The Albion Rover;*
scored a goal" early in ' the first period
from a penalty kick awarded for the
handling of the ball by McGran. Later
Evans put the ball into the net for the
Independents and the. score at the end of
the first half was "one all."
In the second period the Rovers played
downhill and kept the ball in Indeper.dert
territory much of the time, but though
their forwards had many shots, they
scored only once. The Independents now
and then made a rush, tiut were not abl-3
to get a goal. Petrie. Lydon and Ander
son played well for the winners, while tha
Fay brothers and Antrobus did good work
for the losers. Neither Balmaln nor Watt
seemed to be playing so strong a game a*
formerly. Antrobus cleared many dan
gerous shots well. The referee was C. W.
Irish, who kindly undertook to perform
the duties at the request of the teams.
The ground is in good condition now.
the rain having softened it and laid tha
dust. The proceeds of the game are far

Three Young Men Arrested
on a Charge of Assault With
Intent to Commit â¢' Kotitiery
DENY BEING FOOTPADS
Assert That Alleged Victim
Bumped Into Two of Them
and Blows Were Exchanged
Three young men, Fred J. Collins, night
clerk at the Neptune Hotel, 633 Post
street; Eugene G. Smith, a draughtsman
living at the Maryland Hotel. | and Eu
gene Band, a bartender at the Maryland
bar, are In the: city Prison charged with
an assault with intent to commit robbery.
The complaining witness is George J. El
liott, a real estate dealer, living at 239
Powell street.
Elliott was in an automobile with J. A.
McMillen and McMlllen's wife and daugh
ter, who also live at 239 Powell street.
Shortly after 2 o'clock yesterday morning
the party left the automobile in a garage
on Taylor street, at the rear of the Clara
Barton Hospital. While walking home
Elliott left the others to go to a house at
Taylor and Bush streets, and he alleges
he was attacked by two men on Taylor
street, near Adelaide place. They knocked
him down and he shouted for help. Mc-
Mlllen heard his cries and saw him on
the sidÂ«walk~scuffling with two men, who
had him down. McMillen ran to his as
sistance and beat the two men off. El
liott's assailants ran away, leaving their
hats behind. One of the hats had the
name "E. G. Smith" on a band inside.
The police were notified and Smith was
found in the basement of the Maryland
Hotel without his hat. Collins -was found
at the Neptune Hotel. Both were taken
to Elliott and he identified them as the
two men who had attacked him. They
were taken to the City Prison and booked
on the charge of assault to rob. Later
Sergeant Mullender and Policemen J.-B.
O'Connor, Lanckman, Wratten and
Reavls found a cuff at the scene of the
affray and discovered that Band, who
was found at the Maryland bar, had only
one cuff. He was arrested, but refused
to make any statement. *
Later Band made a statement that he
was taking Smith to a drug store to have
his face attended to when Elliot bumped
into them. One word led to another, and
then a fight started. McMillen, he said, and
the two women joined in the fight and he
and Smith got the worst of it. They
both ran away, leaving- their hats. There
was no thought in their minds of rob
bery.. Smith corroborated Band and said
that he and Collins had had a fight with
three men in front of the Neptune Hotel
over a woman, and Band. was taking him
to a drug store to get his bruised face
dresssd. Collins corroborates Smith as to
the flsrht with the three menafnd declares
that Elliott is entirely mista%n in identi
fying him as one of the two men with
whom he had the fight. ' Â£\
Both of Smith's eyes -are puffed and
blackened by the fight with the three
men, he says. One of Collins' eyes is
blackened and his nose bruised and swol
len, and Band has a cut on his nose,
which he said was from a blow from the
elder of the two w&men. The three men
said they had all been'drinklng in a'sa
loon near the Neptune . Hotel, and Smith
admits he was considerably under the in
fluence of liquor. - In view of Band's ad
mission it, is likely that Collins will be
discharged.

COLLINS FREE
ON BAIL BOND
Judge Lawlor Releases the
Accused Attorney on an
Authenticated Security
SAME AMOUNT IS FIXED
Fifteen Thousand Dollars Is
Sum Accepted, to Disap
pointment of Byington
George D. Collln3 was admitted to
ball last night; by Judge Lawlor In
the sum of $16,000 on a bond furnished
by the Aetna Indemnity Company. IHe
spent his Christmas eve with his latest
wife and her mother. From the time
the jury disagreed and was discharged
Collins. has made an energetic attempt
to be admitted to bail, and after making
an 'appeal to Chief Justice Beatty of
the Supreme Court and. Associate Jus
tice Angellotti the % recent defendant
was liberated by Judge Lawlor on pre
sentation of authenticated security.
Judge Lennon has withdrawn entire
ly from the 1 case and It is probable
that the contempt proceedings against
the Newman brothers will be heard be
fore Judge Lawlor. The principal rea
son for "Judges Lennon's refusal to ; ac
cept the bond last Saturday afternoon
was the . failure of Collins to have the
proper certificate from State Insurance
Commissioner Wolf vouching for the
strength of the indemnity company.
The liberation of Collins was hast
ened by -the- efforts of Special Counsel
L? P. Boardman, who was assiduous in
securing his client's release. The sign
ing of the : release by Judge Lawlor.
carries with It" an order; to Collins to
report every morning to the court at
8:80 o'olock. This morning he will re
port at 11 o'clock, but hereafter the
earlier, hour has been set.
Collins was elated over his prospects
and happy at his liberation. He talked
freely, of his plans regarding hlsbusi
ness and said that he has given up the
idea of leaving the city and starting
a career' somewhere t else.,- He intends
reopening " his office in the Crocker
building arid will continue his practice
before the local courts. He is prepar
ing a number of affidavits charging
various offenses against \ those con
nected with his prosecution and says he
will appear; before the court Tuesday
morning to ask that citation Issue com
manding the parties to show cause
why they shall not be punished for
contempt, v.
In. the meantime Byington Is pro
ceeding in the matter of gathering
proof that Collins approached members'
of the venire and that ulterior notives
Induced Jurymen Hartley, Hunter and
Hickman to give their votes for ac
quittal. He is also preparing a state
ment to Judge Lawlor requesting that
Collins' bai^ be. increased to $40,000.
Despite his eager desire to see the con
clusion of Collins'. case before his term
expires it is â¢ impossible \ for the cause
to be set. as the Minnie* Adams trial
will interfere. The duty of prosecuting
Collins ! will devolve, upon District At

will proceed within legal lines in the
direction required. ;* <,Tir
LAMP EXPLODES;
WOMAN DEAD
Mrs. Elizabeth Metzger Is
the Victim* of Fatal Acci
dent in a Lodging-House
Mrs Elizabeth Metzger, a widow 35
years old, was fatally burned by the ex
plosion of a coal oil lamp in her , room,
739 Folsom street, . yesterday afternoon.
The unfortunate creature ran out into
the hallway, her. clothes on ; fire. She
was unable to make an, outcry. Albert T.
Jones, one of the/ 1 lodgers, and little
Henry Vanseggren, 'grandson *of the land

on the head and body, and suffering
terrible pain, retained consciousness

said the lamp â¢ exploded after she < lit it
and her -wrapper caught fire. She
became excited and rati. out Into the
hallway, fanning the flame as she ran.
She was' one mass of flame when the
officers arrived. :'\u25a0 v

HEAP SPLENDID CHOIRS
Sweet Yuletide Music Floods
Air and*. Preachers Tell
of "Good Will to All Men"
Christmas services were observed yes
terday in the evangelical churches cf the
city, and in each case- the decorations
were in harmony with the season. The
congregations were large in every Instance
and the sermons all breathed the words,
"good will tcj men." .
Choirs were augmented, and in several
churches an dtchestra accompanied the
voices iin the rendition of the sacred
music.: --' '-%^V'!: â '- '
The First Presbyterian Church present
ed a beautiful_ appearance, the Christmas
decorations being of the choicest floral
kind. The pulpit was clad in brakes and
poinsettias, and the rest of the church
was one mass of evergreens. The Yule
tide music was superbly rendered.
The theme of the sermon, by the Rev.
William Kirk Guthrie, was a simple
Christmas message, breathing the spirit
of the time and founded on the third
note. of the angel's song. "Good will to
men"â God's good ; will to men, and .in
consequence of God's good will to men,
man's good will to man.
Mr. Guthrie said in effect:
God had been tryinK for ages to teach men
about Himself, by mercy and by judgment, by
prophet and by poet, by sorrow and by joy,
but the end of it all was that the world bj
wtsdom knew not God and in the hour of Its
deepest darkness He sent His son to give It
lluht and leadingâ to lead It Into the better
life. . .
The greatest thing in the world Is â¢ life. In
fact, without life the world is not and the
failure of the world's life is that Its life is
not risht.
Life, physical or sDirltual. depends on the
double process of receiving and giving. Man
doec : not = live by bread alone, but by a
thousand and ' one subtle Influences which re
ceived, consciously or unconsciously, nourish
a > perfect life, but all reception means re
filetion. The end of repletion Is corruption, so
lfe sto be continuous must give ' out as well
as take In. . * - ,- -
1 1 This common-place of our physical life Is
absolutely true of our spiritual life, we re
ceive it of God that we may give it to men
and he who "refuses to give love, symj>athy,
patience, himself has filled of his best possi
bility and is out of harmony with the spirit
of Christmas time.
Calvary Presbyterian Church presented
a handsome appearance with the, simple
holly and berry decorations which hung
from the massive gallery. The Christmas
exercises in the morning: were by the
Sunday School, whose singing of . the
carols, "Hall . Him Your King," "The
Blessed Morn," "Sweet Song of Joy," and
"Host of Heaven Singing" was most ef
fective. The choir was heard in anthem
and carol \u25a0 also, and the pastor, the Rev.
John Hemphill, D. D., recited the prayer
and delivered a most impressive s Christ
mas greeting.
The evening service consisted almost
wholly of selections from Handel's "Mes
siah," which were exquisitely rendered.
Hother Wismer played as a violin solo
Handel's "Largo" : Miss Louvia Rogers
sang the solo,. "Glory to God "on High."
for the offertory, and Dr. Hemphill made
a-.brief Christmas address.
"Bethlehemr*and After", was the theme
of the Christmas sermon delivered yes
terday morning -by the Rev. George E.
Burllngatne of Chicago at the First Bap
tist Church, 320 Eddy street.
, The sermon was listened to with intense
Interest Mr. Burlingame said in part:
â¢ \u25a0 - \u25a0
- The drama of the incarnation Is cast in four
scenes, which for two millenniums have been
the inspiration of poet and preacher and wor
shiper
The figures In these four scenes are Mary,
the Angels, the Shepherds and the 'Wise Men.
These groups have a common center In the
manger \u25a0at Bethlehem. \ In the return of each
group to their former life there seems to be
an anti-climax,' a collapse of all myatery and
strangeness. Yet, in. fact, the return, of Mary
to | Nazareth, of the Angels to heaven, of the
Shepherds to their Hocks and of the Wise Men
to the East, reveals a profound principle of the
Christian faith.
Jesus came into the -\u25a0world, not to disrupt
natural human relations,' nor to disturb the
normal life, but to purify and ennoble these re
lations and to make the " commonplace life
Bacred by his presence and by his Influence.
"We come to Bethlehem to meet our Savior,
and as we ko back from that vision to the
dally round, the common task, he goes with
us to transform the old life and make It for
ever new and Bweet and stronsr.
Special Christmas services were held at
the Plymouth Congregational Church,
1760 '; Post street, yesterday at 11 .a.
m., and in the evening at 7:45. Rev.
I. Curtis Meserve, D. D., the pastor of
the church, delivered a strong sermon to
his congregation at the morning wor
ship, choosing as his text, "Thanks Be
Unto God for His Unspeakable Gift," and
also called attention to a yuletide prayer
which he was anxious the people should
submit, to their careful consideration. A
choir composed of the regular quartet
and a bevy of young ladies from the Sun
day School rendered Christmas selections,
accompanied by- Professor F. Dellepiane,
the church organist.
The ; auditorium ', was attractively dec
orated with holly and Christmas greens,
as was also the Sunday School. ln which
the young people; prior to the morning
church services, rendered their pro
gramme. : ..
>Dr. MeservÂ© spoke at the momlng.ser
vlce In part as follows: ,
