down my back.
"I didn't' have any!" ! I exclaimed.
"Why, I certainlyâ"
"You certainly had no purse, for I
should have seen It and starched it if
you had." *|
Now, what do you think of a woman
like that? ' Â¦

and expostulated and it last walked
put with the sergeantâ giving me a
queer last look that was half -cursing,
half-placatingâ I stood chatting sweet
ly with the woman who had searched
me.
I didn't know Just how far I might
go with her. She knew the paper
wasn't on me, and I coiid see she was
disposed to believe I whs as nice as
she'd have liked me tube. But she'd
had a lot of experience and she knew,
as most women do even\wlthout expe
rience, that if there's mt always fire
where there is smoKQ it's because
somebody's been Â¦Â¦ cleve} enough-and
quick enough to cover th^ blaze.
"Well, good-by," I sale, putting out
my hand. "It's been dlslgreeable but
I'm obliged to you forâ why, Where's
my purse! We must hate left Itâ"
And I turned to go back hto the room
where I'd undressed.
"You didn't have any."!
least unnecessary emphasis and not a
superfluous word, 'ware that woman.
There's only one game to play to let
you hang round here a bit longer and
find out what's become of the baby.
Play it!"
I looked at her with respect; it was
both real and feigned.
"Of course, you must be right,", I
said humbly. "I know you wouldn't
be likely to make a mistake, but, Just
to convince me, do you mind letting me
go back to look?"
"Not at all." she said placidly. "If
I go with you there's no reason why
you should not look." \
Oh, t Mag, it was hard lines' looking.
Why? Why,, because the place was so
bare and so small. There were so few
things to move and It took Buch a
shor.t time, in .spite of all I could do
and pretend to do, that I was In de
spair. Â¦
"You must be right," I said at length,
looking woefully up at her.
' ."Yes, I knew I was," she said stead
ily. - :
"I must have lost It."
There was no hope there. I turned
to go.
"I'll lend you a nickel to get home,
if you'll leave me your address," she
said after a moment.
Oh, that admirable woman! She
ought to be ruling empires instead of
searching thieves. Look at the bal
ance of her, Mag. My best acting had
n't shaken her. She hadn't that fatal
curiosity to understand motives that
take. Which way? . . . I'll come
back/ Mr. Tausig, to receive your apol
ogy, but you can hardly expect .me to
go tp lunch after this."
Hev growled a wrathful, resenting
mouthful. But he looked a bit puzzled
just the same. <.
He looked more puzzled yet, even be
wildered, when we came back into the
main office a quarter of an hour later,
the woman and I, and she reported
that no paper of any kind had she
found. . â¢
Me? Oh, I was sweet amiability per

sergeant, who began to back-water fu-

Bamboozled the woman?" Not a bit
of it; you can't deceive women with
mouths and eyes like that. It was just
that I'd had a flash of genius in the
minute I heard Tausig's voice, and in

"What'll you do?" . .

from the very whisper in which he had
spoken, that the last thing in the world

tripped up on one thing. I "didn't
know there was a middle 'way for a

His manner changed.
"Nance Olden." he said aloud now,
"I charge you with stealing a valuable
piivate paper of mine from my desk.
Here, sergeant!"
I hadn't particularly noticed the ser
geant standing at the door with his
back to us. But from the way he came
at Tausig's call I knew he'd had a
private talk with him, and I knew he'd
found the middle wa>.
"This girl's taken a paper of mine.
I want her searched," Tauslg cried.
"Do you mean," I said, "that you'll

meant a special pull and a special way

call them the temporarily unstraight.
She was satisfied Just not to let me
get ahead of her In the least particu
lar. ; But she wasn't mean, and she
, would lend me a nickelâ not an emo
tionally extravagant 10-cent piece, but
Just a nickelâ on the chance that I
was what I seemed to toe.
Oh, I did admire her; but I'd have
been more enthusiastic about It If I
could have seen my way clear to the
baby and the paper.
I took tht nickel and thanked her,
but effusiveness" left her unmoved. A
wholesome, blue-gowned rock with a
neat, full-bibbed white apron; that's
what she was!
And still I lingered. Fancy Nance
Olden Just heartbroken at being com
pelled to leave a police station!
But there was nothing for It. Go.
I had to. My head was a-whirl with
schemes coming forward with sugges
tions and being dismissed as unsuit
able; my thoughts were flying -about
at such a dizzy rate while I stood there
In the doorway, the woman's- patient
hand on the knob and her watchful
eyes on me, that f actuallyâ /
Mag, I actually didn't hear the mat
ron's voice the first time she spoke.
The second time, though, I turned
âso happy I could not keep the tremor
out of my voice.
"1 thought you had gone long ago,"
she said. â¢ ' V .
Oh, we were friends, we two! We'd
chummed over a baby, which for
women is like what taking a drink
together is for men. The admirable
dragon in the blue dress didn't waver
a bit because her superior, spoke pleas
antly to me. She only watched and
listened.
Which puts you in a difficult posi
tion when your name's Nance Olden
âyou have to tell the truth.
"I've been detained," I said with
dignity, "against my wish. But that's
all over. I'm going now. Good-by." I
nodded and caught up my skirt. "Oh!"
I paused Just ,as the admirable dra
gon was closing the door on me. "Is
the baby asleep? I wonder If I might
see her once more."
My heart was beating like an engine
gone mad. In spite of my careless tone.
and there was a buzzing In my ears
that deafened me. But I managed to
stand still and listen, and then to walk
off, as though It didn't matter in the
least to me. while her words came
smashing the hope out of me.
"We've sent her with an officer back
to the neighborhood where you found
her. He'll find out where she belongs,
no doubt. Good day."
Ah me, Maggie, the miserable Nance
that went away from that station! To
have had your future in your grasp,
like that one of the Fates with the
string; and then to have It snatched
from you by an . impish -breeze and
blown away, goodness knows where!
Â¦ I don't know Just which way I turned
after I left that station. I didn't care
where I went. Nothing I could think
of gave me any comfc-rt. I tried to
fancy myself coming home to you. I
tried to see myself going down to tell
the whole thing to.Obermuller. But I
couldn't do that. There was only one
thing I wanted to say to .Fred Ober
muller, and .that thing I couldn't say
now.
But Nance Olden's not the girl to
go around long like a molting hen.
There was only one chance in a hun
dred, and that was the one I took, of
course. 5
"Back to the square where you found
the baby, Nance!" I cried to myself.
"There's the chance inat that admir
able dragon has had her suspicions
aroused by your connection with the
baby, which she hadn't Known before,
and has already dutifully notified the
sergeant. There's the chance that thÂ»
baby is home by now and the paper
found by her mother will Â¦ be turned
over to her papa; and then it's good
by to your scheme. There's the chance
thatâ"
But in the heart ot me I didn't be
lieve in any chance but one â the chance
that I'd find that blessed baby and
get my fingers once more on that
precious paper.
I blew in the A. D.'s nickel on a
cross-town car and got back to the
little square. There was another or
gan-grinder there grinding out coon
eongs, to which other pickaninnies
danced. But nary a little white bundle
of fluff caught hold of my hand. . I
walked that square till my feet were
sore. It was hot. My throat was
. parched. I was hungry- My head
ached. I was hopeless. And yet I
Just couldn't give it up. I had asked
bo many children and nurse-maids .
whether they'd heard of the baby lost
that morning and brought back by- an
officer that they began to look at me
as though I was not quite right in my
mind. The maids grabbed the chil
dren if they started to come near me.
and the children stared at me with
big round eyes, as though they'd been
told I was an ogre who might eat
them. '
I waa. hungry enough too. The little
fruitstand at the entrance had a fas
cination for me. I found myself there
time and again; till I got afraid I might
actually try to get off with a peach
or a bunch of grapes. That thought
haunted me. Fancy Nance Olden'
starved and blundering into the cheap
est and most easily detected species
of thieving!
I suppose great generals in their hour
of defeat Imagine themselves doing the
feeblest, fooliahest things. As I sat
there on the bench, gazing before me,
I saw the whole thingâ Nancy Olden,
after all her bragging, her skirmish
ing, her .hairbreadth escapes and suc
cesses, arrested in broad daylight and
before witnesses for .having stolen a
cool, wet bunch of grapes.' worth a
nickel, for her hot, dry, hungering
throat! I saw the policeman that'd
do it.-- he looked like that Sergeant
Mulhill I met 'way, 'way back jn Lati
rner's garden. I saw the officer that'd
receiv* me; he had blue eyes like the
detective that came for me to the Man
hattan. I saw the woman Jailerâ oh,
she was the A. D., all right, who'd re
ceive me without the slightest emotion,
show me to a cell and lock the door,
as calm, as little triumphant or affect
ed as though I hadn't once outwitted
that cleverest of creatures â and out
witted myself in forestalling her. ' I
sawâ " ' .
Mag, guess what I saw! No. truly;
what I. really saw? It made me jump
to' my feet and grab It with a squeal.
I saw my own purse lying on the
gravel almost at my feet, near the
little fruitstand that had tempted me.
Blar.k empty it was. stripped clean,
not a penny left In It. not a paper, not
a stamp, not even my key. Just the
same I was glad to have it. It linked
me in a way to the place. The clever
little girl that had stolen It had been
here' In this park, on this very spot.
The thought of that cute young Nance
Olden distracted my mind a minute
from my worryâ and, oh, Maggie dar
lin', I was worrying suf
,, I .walked. up to the frultatand with
the purse in my hand. The old fellow
who kept It looked up with an Inviting
smile. Lord knows, ha needn't have
encouraged me to buy if I'd had a
penny.
"1 want to ask you," I said. "If you
remember selling a lot of good things
to a little girl who had a purs* thisâ
this morning?"
I showed it to him, and he turned It
over In his crippled old hand*.
"It was fuller thenâ or fuller, any
way," I suggested.
"You wouldn't want to get her Into
troubleâ that little girl?" ha asked cau
tiously.
I laughed. "Not L Iâ myselfâ -

Imagine what I was going to say. and
that I didn't say it or anything like it.

over yonder." he said.
I gasped, Jt was 'so unexpected. And
I turned to look. There on one of the
benches sat Kitty Wilson. If I hadn't
been blind as a bat and full of trou&le
â oh. It thickens your wits, does trou
ble, and blinds, your eyes a and muffles
your ears! â I'd have suspects sorne
thing at the mere eight of â¢her. For
there sat Kitty Wilson enthroned, a
hatless. lank little creature about 12,
and near her, clustered thick as ants
around a lump of sugar, was a crowd
of children, black and white, boys and
girls. For Kittyâ that deplorable Kitty
âhad money to burn; or what was
even more effective at her age, she had
goodies to give away. Her lap was full
of spoils. She had a sample of every
good thing the fruitstand offered. Her
cheeks and lips were smeary with
candy. Her dresa . was stained with
fruit. The- crumbs erf cake lingered
still on her chin and apron. And Kitty
â I love a generous thief-'-was treat
ing the gang. - Â¦ .
It helped Itself from her abundant
lap; it munched and gobbled and asked
for more. It was a riot of a high old
time. Even the birds were hopping
about as near as they dared, picking
up the crumbs, and" the squirrels had
peanuts to throw to the birds.
. And all on Nancy Olden's money!
I laughed till. I shook. It was good to
laugh. Nancy Oiden isn't accustomed
to a long dose of the doleful, and it
doesn't agree with her. I strolled over
to where my guests were banqueting.
Tou see, Mag, that's where I could
n"t rank' with the- A. IX I'm too in
. quisitive. I want to know, how the
othe.r fellow in the case faels and
thinks. It isn't enough for me to see
him act.
"Kitty," I saidâ somehow a 12-year
old makes you feel more of a grown
up than a 12-months-old does â "I hope
you're having a good time, Kitty Wll-
Bon, but â haven't you lost something'"
She was chewing at the end of a long
string of black candy â shoe-string, all
right, the stuft looks like â and she was
eating Just because she didn't want to
stop; Goodness knows, she, was full
enough. Her Jaw3 stopped, though,
suddenly, as she looked from the empty
purse in my outstretched hand to me
and took me in..
.Oh. I know. that pause- intimately.
It says: "Walt a minute, till I get my
breath and I'll know how much you
know and Just .what 11* to tell you."
But she changed her mind w,hen she
saw my face. Tou know, Hag, If
there's . a . thing, .that's -fixed In your
memory it's the face of the body you've
done up. The respectables have their
rogues' gallery, but we. that Is, the
light-flngered brigade, have got a fools'
gallery to correspond to it.
In which of 'em 13 my picture.? Now.
Margaret, that's mean. You know my
portrait hangs in" both.
I locked down on the little beggar
that had painted me for the. second
salon, and ]o, in a flash she was on
her feet, the lapful of good things
tumbled to the ground, and Kitty was
off.
I was bitterly disappointed In that

THE/ SAN FRANCISCO: SUNDAY; CALIl
IN THE BISHOP'S CARRIAGE
2Oh, Mas. it's such fun to be a woman
and have a man wait on you !ike tnat!
It's such fun to be hungrv und to sit
down to a Jolly little tabl? Just big
enough for two, with carnations nod
dinr In the tall slim vase, with a fat,
eoft-footed. qulck-handej waiter danc
ing behind you. and something tempt
<ce in every dish your eye falls on.
And then I caught sight of the car
riage. Yes, Maggie, the same fat, low,
comfortable, elegant, sober carriage,
wide and well-kept, with rubber-tired
wheels. And the two heavy horses, fat
and elegant and sober, too, and wide
and well-kept. I knew whose it was
the minute my eyes lighted on It, and
I couldn't â 1 just couldn't resist' it. Â¦
The man on the box â still wide and
well-kept â was wide-awar.e this .time.
I nodded to him as 1 slipi ed in and
closed the door after me.
"I'll wait for the Bishop," I said,
with a red-coated assurance that left
him no alternative but to accept the
situation respectfully.
Oh, dear, dear! It -was soft and
warm inside as it had been that long,
lonÂ»-ago day. The seat was wide and
roomy. The cushions had been done
overâ I resented thatâ but though a
different material, they were a still
darker plum. And instead of "Quo
Vadls," the Bishop had been reading
"Resurrection."
I took it up and glanced over It as I
sat there; but, you know, Mag, the
heavyweight plays never appealed to
me. I don't go ln for the tragic â per
haps I saw too much of the real thing
when I was little.
At any rate, it seemed dull to me,
and I put It aside and sat there absent
mindedly dreaming of a' little girl-thief
that I knew once when â when the han
dle of the door turned and the Bishop
got In, and we were off.
Oh. the little Bishopâ the contrast
between him and the fat, pompous
rig caught me. He seemed littler
and leaner than ever, his little
wh'ite beard scantier, his soft eye
kindlier and his soft heartâ
"God bless my soul!" he exclaimed.
Jumping almost out of "Ms neat little
boots, while he looked sharply over his
spectables.
What did he see?, Just a red-coated
ghost dreaming in the corner of his
carriage. JÂ£ made him doubt his eyes
âhis sanity. I don't know what he'd
done If that warm red ghost hadn't
got tired of dreaming and laughed
outright.
"Daddy," I murmured sleepily.
Oh, that little ramrod of a bishop!
The blood rushed up under his clear,
thin, baby-like skin and he bat up
straight and solemn and awfulâ awful
as such a tiny bishop could be. ;
"I fear, Miss, you have made a mis
take," he said primly.
I looked at him steadily.
"You know I haven't," I said gently.
That took some of the starch out of
him, but he eyed me suspiciously.
"Why don't you ask me where I got
a difference, Bishop?" t pleaded.
"Don't I look like aâ an imposing mar
ried woman now? Don't I seem a bitâ
oh. just, a bit nicer?'"
His eyes twinkled as he bent to. look
more closely at me..
"You lookâ you look, my little girl,
exactly like the pretty, big-eyed,
wheedllng-volced child I wished tc have
for my own daughter."
I caught his hand in both of mine."
"Now, that's like my own, own.Bish
op!" I cried.
Magâ Mag, he 'was blushing like a
boyj a prim, rather scared little school
boy that somehow, yet â oh, I knew he
must feel kindly to me! I felt so fond
of him.
"You see. Bishop Van Wagenen," I
began softly, "I never had' a fatlier
and â "
"Bless me! But you told me that day
you had mistaken me forâ for him."
The baby!' I had forgotten what that
old Kdward told me â that this trust
ing soul actually still believed all I'd
told him. What was I to do? I tell
you, Mag, It's no light thing to get ac
customed to telling the truth. Here
was Iâ just a clever little lie or two
and the dear old Bishop would be hap
py and* contented again. But no; that
fatal* habit' that I've acquired of tell
ing the truth to Fred and you mastered
me â and I fell.
"You know, Bishop." I said, shut
ting my eyes and 'speaking fast .to get
It overâ as I. imagine you must, Mag,
when you confess to Father Phelanâ
"that was all aâ a little farce-comedy
âthe whole businessâ all of itâ every
last: word, of it!" .
. "A comedy!"
I opened my eyes to laugh at him;
he -was so bewildered. -, C;v'\?
"I mean aâ a fib; In fact, many of
them. Iâ I was justâ It was long ago
âand I had to make you believeâ"
His soft old eyes looked at me un
believing. "You don't mean to say you
deliberately lied!"
Now, that was what ' I did mean
just what I did meanâ but not in that
tone of voice.
But what could I do? I just looked
at him and nodded.
Oh. Maggie, I felt bo little and so
nasty! I haven't felt like that since
I left the Cruelty. And I'm not nasty,
Maggie, and I'm Fred Obermullcr's
wife, and â
And that put a backbone in me atjain.

anybody think worse of her than she
can help^-from sheer, love and pride

tell you. Even the Bishop had heard
of Nancy Olden. But suddenly, unac
countably, there came a queer, sad look
over his face, and his eyes wouldn't
meet mine.
1 looked at him, puzzled.
"You evidently forget that you have
already told me you are the wife of
Mr.â Mr. Oberâ "
"Obe*-muller. Oh, that's all right." I
laughed aloud. I was so relieved. "Of
course I am, and he's my manager,
and my playwright, and my secretary,
andâ myâ my dear, dear boy. There!"
I wasn't laughing at the end of it. I
never can laugh when- I try to tell
What Fred is to me.

"There! there!" he said, patting me
on the shoulder. "Forgive me. my

"Yesâ I have even told Mrs. Van.

None but the swellest place In town
was good enough, Obermuller had said,
for us to celebrate in. Th3 waiters
looked queerly at us when we came In
âme in my dusty shoes ami mussed
hair and eld rig, and Mr. O. In his
working togs. But do you suppose we
c^red?
He was smoking and I was pretend
ing to eat fruit -.vcen at last I get
fairly launched on -ny story.
He listened to it all with n*v.*r a
word of Interruption. Sometimes I
thought he was bo interested that ho
couldn't bear to miss 't word I said.
And then again I fancied ha wasn't
listening at all to me; only watching
me and listening to something insMe
of himself.
Can you see him, Mag, sitting oppo
site me there at the pretty little table,
off ln a private room by ourselves?
He looked so big and strong and mas
terful, with his eyes half closed, watch
ing me, that I hugged myself with de
light to- think that Iâ I, Nancy Ollcn,
had done something for him he could
n't do for himself.
It made me so proud, so tipslly vain,
that as I leaned forward eagerly ta'k
ing, 1 felt that same intoxicating hap
piness I get on the stage when tho
audience is all with me, and the two
of us â myself and the many-handed,
go* -d-natured other fellow over on the
other side of the footlights â go career
ing off on a jaunt of fun and fancy, lika
two good playmates.
He was silent a minute when I got
through. Then he laid his clear aside
and stretched out his hand tome.
"And the reason, Nance â the reason
fc-r It all?"
I looked up at him. I'd never heard
him BpÂ«ak like that.
"The reason?" I repeated.
"Yes. the reason." He had caught
my hand.
"Whyâ to down that tiger Trustâ
and beat Tausig."
He laughed.
"And that was all? Nonsense, Nance
Olden, there was another reason. There
are other tiger trusts. Are you going
to set up as a lady-errant and right all
syndicate wrongs? No, there was an
other, a bigger reason, Nance. I'm go
ing to tell it to you â what!"
I pulled my hand from his; but not
before that fat waiter who'd come in
without our noticing had got something
to grin about.
"Beg pardon, sir," he said. "This
message must be for you, sir. It's
marked immediate, and no one else^ â "
Obermuller took it and tore it open.
He smiled the oddest smile as he read
it and he threw back his head and
laughed a fuU. hearty bellow when ha
got to the end.
"Read it, Nance." he said, passing It
over to me. "They sent it on from the
office."
"Mr. Fred W. Obermuller, Manager
Vaudeville Theater, New York City,
N. Y.:
"Dear Obermuller â I have just learned
from your little protege, Nance Olden,
of a comedy you've written. From
what Miss Olden tells me of the plot
and situations of 'And the Greatest ot
These'â your title's greatâ I judge thÂ«
thing to be something altogether ouf
of the ccnimon; and my secretary and
reader. Mr. Mason, agrees with me that,
properly Interpreted and perhaps
touched up here and there, the comedy
ought to make a hit.
"Would Miss Olden taKe the leading
role, I wonder?
"Can't you drop in this evening and
talk the matter over? There's an open

just developed within the past few
days, andâ this is 'strictly confidential

foolish personal matter which busi

Is there between you and them? A
mere trifle; a misunderstanding that
half an hour's talk over a bottle of
wine with a good cigar would drive
away.

good fellows, those two. and smart
men, even if they are stubborn as sin.
"Counting on seeing you to-night, my
dear fellow, I am most cordially,
"I. M. TAUSIG."
I dropped the letter and looked over
at Obermuller.
Miss Olden," he said severely, com
ing over to my side of the table, "have
you the heart to harm a generous soul
like that?"
"Heâ he's very prompt. Isn't he, and
most â "
And then we laushed together.
"You notice the letter was marked
personal?" Obermuller said. He was
still standing beside me.
"No â was it?" I got up, too, and be

fingers shook so I couldn't do a thing
with them.
"Oh, yes. It was. That's why I
showed It to you. ... Nanceâ Nance,
don't you see that there's only one
way out of this. There's only one
woman in the world that would do
this for me and that I could take it
from."
I clasped my hands helplessly. Oh,
what could I do, Maggie, with him
there and his arms ready for me!
"Iâ I should think you'd be afraid,"
I whispered. I didn't dare look at him.
He caught me to him then.
"Afraid you wouldn't care for an old
fellow like me?" he laughed. "Yes,
that's the only fear I had. But I lost
it, Nancy, Nancy Obermuller, when
you flung that paper down before me.

XVIL
PHILADELPHIA, January 27.
Maggie, dear:
I'm writing to you Just before dinner
while I wait for Fred. He's down at
the box-office looking up advance sales.
I tell you, Maggie Monahan, we're
strictly in itâ we Obermullers. That
Broadway hit of mine has preceded me
here and we've got the town, I suspect,
In advance.
But I'm not writing to tell you this.
I've got something more interesting to
tell you. my dear old Cruelty chum.
I want you to pretend to yourself
that you see me, Mag, as I came out of
the big Chestnut street store this after
noon, my arms full of bundles. I must
have, on that long coat to my heels,
of dark, warm red, silk-lined, with the
long, incurving back sweep and high
chinchilla collar, that Fred ordered
made for me the very day : w* w ere
"lt'3; Nance Clden,. ladies." he said,
with a dignified little wave of his hand
that served fo ran introduction. "She
beprins her Philadelphia engagement to
night in 'And the Greatest of These.' "
Oh, I'm used to it now, Maggie, but I
do net lik*e it. All the lady-swells buzz
ed about me, and there Nance stood
preening herself and crowing softly
till â till from among the bunch of mil
linery .or.e of them stepped up to me.
She had a big smooth face with plenty
of chins. Her hair was white and her
nose was curved and she rustled in
8l!k andâ
It was Mrs. Dowager Diamonds, alias
Henrietta, alias Mrs. Edward Ramsay!
"Clever! My, how clever!" she ex
clalmtd, as though the sob ln my voice
that I couldn't control had been a bit of
acting. ' ' â¢ ,
She was feeling for her glasses. When
she got them and hooked them on her
nose raid got a good look at me â why,
she . just dropped them with a smash
upon the desk.
I looked for a minute from her to the
Bishop.
"I remember you very well, Mrs.
Ramsay. I hope you haven't forgotten
me. I've often wanted to thank you
for your kindness," I said slowly, while
she as slowly recovered. "I think you'll
be glad to know that I am thoroughly
wp 11â cured. * â¢ â¢ Shall I. tell Mrs.
Ramsay how. Bishop?"
I put It square up to him. And he
mf t !t like the little man he i3 â per
haps, too. my bit of charity to the Cru
elty children had pleased him. -~p\
"1 don't think it will be necessary.
Miss Olden," he said, gently. "I can
do that for y6u Â«.t some future time."
And. I. could have hugged him; but I
didn't dare.
We had tea there in the board rooms.
Oh. Mag, remember how we used to
peep,tnto those awful, imposing board
rooms!. "Remember how strange and
resentful . you feltâ like a poor little
"They're for the children. I want
them to have ; them all and now.
please, to do whatever they want with
them. There'll always oe others.
I'm going to. send them right along,
if you'll let me, so that those who
leave can take something of their very
own v.ith themâ something that never
belonged to anybody else bat - just
themselves, you understand. It's terri
ble, don't you know, to be a deserted
child or a tortured chi/d cr a crippled
child and have nothing to do but sit
up In that bare, clean little room up-
Ftairs with a lot of other strangelinss
âand just think on the cruelty that's
brought you here and the cruelty you
may get into when you leave here. If
I'd had a dollâ If- Mag had only had a
set of dishes or a little tin kitchenâ if
the bey "with tho gouged eye could
have had a set of tools â oh, can't you
understand â " -
I became conscious then that the ma
tron â a. new one, Mag, ours is gone â
was staring at me. and that the. people
stood around listening as though I'd
gone mad.
Who came to my rescue? Why. the
Bishop, like the manly little fellow he
is, Ho forgave, me even Beryl in that
moment.- .
"Ah, here we are!" he said. "I must
ask you to excuse me, Missâ ah, Mrs.â
that Isâ there's a publ'- meeting of the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Children this afternoon that I must
attend. Good-by, then â "
"Oh, are you bound for the Cruelty,
"too?" I asked. "Why, so am I. Andâ
yesâ yesâ that's the Cruelty!"
The Cruelty stands just where it did,
Mag, when you and I nrst saw it; most
things do in Philadelphia, you know.
There's the" same prim.offlcial stralght
up-and-downness about the brick front.
The steps don't look so steep now and
the. building's not so high, perhaps be
cause of a sky-scraper or two that" re
gone up since. But it chills your
blood. Maggie, darlin'. Just as it always
did, to think what it stands for. Not
man's inhumanity to man, but women's
cruelty to children! Maggie, think of It.
if you can, as though this were the
first time you'd heard of such a thing!
Would you believe it? ;.Â¦
I waked from that to find myself
marching up the stairs behind the Uish
op's rigid little back. Oh. it. was stiff
and uncompromising: lieryl Black
burn did that for me. Poor, pretty, pa
gan Beryl!
My coming with the Bishopâ we
seemed to come together, anyway â
made the people think he'd brought
me, so- I must be just all right. I
had the man bring in the toys I'd got
out in the carriage, and I handed them
over to the matron, saying:
Just between you and me, Bishop, I've
more respect for a girl of that kind
than for Grace Weston, whose husband
is my leading man, you know. Why,
she pulls the wool over his eyes and
makes him the laughing stock of the
company. I can't stand her any more
than I can Marie Avon, who's never
without two stringsâ"
All at once I stopped. But . wasVt
It like me to spoil it ail by bubbling
over? I tell you, Maggie, too much
truth isn't good for the Bishop's set;
they don't know how to digest it.
â¢I was afraid that I'd lost him, for he
spoke with a stately little primness
as the carriage just then came to a
stop; I had been so interested talking
that I hadn't noticed where we were
driving.
red-haired nigger up at the block â
when you were brought ln there to be
shown to the woman who'd called to
adopt you!
It was all so strange that I had to
keep talking to keep from dreaming.
I v.-aa talking away to the matron and
the Bishop 'about the play-room I'm
going to Ot up out of that bare little
place upstairs. Perhaps the same child
doesn't stay there very long, but
there'll always be children to fill itâ
more's the cruel pity!
Then the IUshop and I climbed up
thereto see it and plan about It. But I
couldn't really see it, Mag, cor the poor,
white-faced, wise-eyed little waifs that
have succeeded us, for the tears in ray
eyes and the acho at my heart and the
queer trick the place ha.3'uÂ£ beins peo
pled with you and me, and the boy
with the soused eye. and the cripple,
and the rest.
He put his gentle thin old arm about
my shoulders for a moment when ha
saw what was tho matter with me.
Oh, he understands, my Bishop! And
then we turned to jjo downstairs.
"Oh â I want â I want lo tlo something
for .them," 1 cried. "I want to do
something thiit counts, that's got a.
heart in it. that knows! You knew;
didn't yuo, it was true â what I said

"My dear," he isaiu, very stately and
sweet. "I'll be yruud to b~* your assist

And j'j.5t at that minutV, as I was

a girl in a red coat tTtmmed with chin

the peacock cumins cp wasn't in it with
tho Â»>.io soin? down. Her coat wasn't
so fine, nor so iicavy, cor so newly,

She didn't recognize me, of course,
even though th? two red cuata were so
near, as she stoppe-d to let me pass, that
they kissed like tre tli^y parted.
Cut. TJae. Nancy Ulden n.-ver got

stood Mrs. Kin^donâ still Mrs. Kins

hind her. at the foot of the steps, was
a frail little old-fashioned bundle of
black satin and old lace. I lost my
breath when tho Bishop hailed hl3

She's the girl I wanted for my daugh
ter â you'll remember, it's more than a
year ago now since I began to talk
about her?"
I held my breath while I waited for
her answer. But her poor, short-sight
ed eyes rested on my hot face without
a sign.
Â¦ "It's an old joke among us.** she said
pleasantly, "about the Bishop's daugh-
We stood there and chatter, and thÂ»
Bishop turned away to speak to Mrs.
â¢ Kingdon. Then I seized my chance.
"I've heard, Mrs. Van Wasenen," I
said softly and oh. as nicely as I could,
"of your fondness for lace. We are go
ing abroad In the. spring; my husband
and T. to Malta, amonsr other places.
Can't I get you a piece there as a sou

Her 'little lace-mittened, parchment
like hands clasped and unclasped with
an almost childish eagerness.
"Oh, thank you, thank you very
much; but if you would give the sams
sum to charity â "
"I will," I laughed. She couldn't
guess how glad I wa3 to do this thlngr.
"And I'll spend just as much on your
lace and ba so happy If you'll accept
it."
I promised Henrietta a box for to

to come, though her husband 13 out of
town, unfortunately, she said.
"But you'll come with me, won't yon,
Elshop?" she said, turning to him, "And
you, Mrs. Van?"
The Bishop blushed. Was hÂ» think
ing of Beryl, I wonder. But I didn't
hear his answer, for It was at that
moment that I caught Fred's volca.
He had tc-ld me he was going to call
for me. I think he fancied that thÂ«
old Cruelty would depress meâ as
dreams of it have, you know; and ha
wanted to come and carry me- away

off together, on Fred and
NANCT O.
she'd Blip through my hands, but a
sudden rival voice piping out, 'Til
fc!jow ye the house. Missus," was too
much for her.
So, with Kit at a safe distance ln
advance to guard against treachery,
srid a large and enthusiastic following,
I crossed the street, turned a corner,
walked down one block and half up
r.noiher. end halted before a three
ttory brownstone.
I flew up the stairs, leaving my
escort behind, and rang the belL It
wasn't so terribly swagger a place,
which relieved me some.
â¢I want to see the lady whose baby
was lest this morning," I said to the
maid that opened the door.
"Yes'm. Who'll I tell her?"
Who? That stumped me. Not Nance
Olden, late of the Vaudeville, later of
the Van Twiller. and latest of the
police station. Noâ not Nance Olden
* * *
â¢Tell her. please," I said firmly,
"that I'm Miss Murieson of the X-Ttay,
and that the city editor has sent me
he-re to see her."
That did it. Hooray for the power
of the press! She showed me into a
long parlor and I 6at down and waited.
It was cool and quiet and softly pret
ty in that long parlor. The shades
were down, the piano was c-pen, the
chairs were low and softly cushioned.
1 leaned back and closed my eyes, ex
haustec.
And suddenlyâ Mag! â I felt some
thing that was a cress between a rose
leaf and a tnonflake touch my hand.
If Jt wasn't that delectable baby!
I caucht her andÂ« lifted her to my
lap and hugged the chuckling thing as
though that was what I came for.
Then, ln a moment, I remembered the
paper ar.d lifhted her little white slip.
It was gone, Mag. The under-petti
coat hadn't a sign of the paper I'd
pinned to it.
My head whirled in that minute. I
suppose I was faint with the heat, with
hunger and fatigue and worry, but I
felt myself slipping cut of things when
1 heard the rustling of skirts, and there
before me 6tood the motner of my
baby.
The little wretch! She deserted me
and new to that pretty mother of hers
in her long, cool white trailing things,
and sat in her arms and mocked at
me.
It was easy enough to begin talking.
S told hT a tale about being a news
paper woman cut on a story; how I'd
run across the baby and all the rest of
it.
â¢I r^'jst ask your pardon," I finished
up. "for disturbing you, but two things
gpnt me here â one to know if the baby
got home safe, and the other," I
gulped, "to ask about a paper with
some notes that I'd pinned to her
skirt."
She shook her head.
It was in that very minute that I no
ticed the baby's ribbons were pink;
they had been blue in the morning.
"Of course," I suggested, "you've had
her clothes changed and â "
-Why, yes, of course," said baby's
mother. "The first thing I did when
I sot hold of her was t<j strip her and
put her in a tub; the second, was to
discharge that gossiping nurse for let
tins her out of her sight."
"And. the soiled things she had onâ
the dress with the blue ribbons?"
"I'll find out," she said.
She rarg for the maid and gave her
an order.
"Was it a valuable paper?" she
asked.
"Notâ very." I stammered. My
tongue was thick with hope and dread.
"Just â my notes, you know, but I do
need thssa. I couldn't carry the baby
easily, bo I pinned them on her skirt,
thlnkiiir-thinklnsâ "
The maid came in and dumped a lit
tle heap of white before me. I fell on
my knee*.
Oh. yea, I prayed all right, but I
â¢earched, too. And there it was.
What I aaid to that woman I don't
know evea now. I flew out through
the hall asd down the steps and â
And there Kitty Wilson corralled me.
"Eay, where'a that stickpin?" she
cried.
"Her*:â here, you darling!" I said,
pressing It into her hand. "Asd, Kitty,
wherever you feel like swiping another
purse â just don't do it- It doesn't pay.
Just you come down to the Vaudeville
and ask for Nance Olden soroe day,
asd 1*11 tell you why."
"Gee!" said Kitty, Impressed. "Shall
â shall I call ye a hansom, lady?"
Should shel The blessed inspiration
cf her!
I (ot into the wagon asd we drove
down streetâ tÂ© the Vaudeville.
I burst in past the stage doorkeeper,
amazed to see me, and rushed Into
Fred Obermuller's efflce.
"There!** I cried, throwing that awful
paper oa the desk before him. "Now
cinch 'em, Fred Obermuller, as they
cinched you. It'll be the holiest black
mail that everâ oh, aad will you pay
for the hansom?"
I don't remember much about the
first part of the lunch. I was so hun
gry I w anted to eat everything ln sight,
and eo happy that I couldn't eat a

But Mr. O. kept piling the things on
my plate, and each time I began to
talk he'd say: "Not nowâ wait till
you're rested, and not quite so fam
ished."
I laughed.
â¢'Do I eat as though I was starved?"
"Youâ you look tired, Nance."
"Well." I said slowly, "it's been a
hard week."
"It's been hard for mÂ», too; harder.

that Father Kelly wrote out f'r me:
To Martin Dooley, Hayro,

ANDHREW CARNAYGIE

"I'll be so mad, I'll throw ye in again, ( but that won't help

"Iv coorsc, I won't ,be good f'r annything else. I'll have to

acrost a bar an' mendin' a refracthry beer pump? I'll quit
wurruk f'r good an' hang ar-round a livery stable pitchin' horse
shoes. They'se nawthin' a hayro with a medal can do f'r a
livin' that ain't beneath him. Wanst a hayro, always a hayro.
After awhile I'll be lurkin' in th' corner iv th' bridge an' pushin'
me frinds into th' river an' haulin' thim out f'r a medal. I'll be
come an habichool Carnaygie hayro an' good f'r nawthin' else.
No, me frind, don't iver fall into th' canal whin I'm ar-round. I
might be lookin' th' other way.
"An' think iv th' position ye ar-re in all this time, th' man
who's life I've saved. Nawthin' cud be lower. Ye'er raymim

to lind me money whin I want it an' if ye complain people call
ye an ingrate. Befure ye die, ye'll wisht ye'd pulled me into th'
canal with ye.
"I wanst knowed a la-ad that was more or less riscued fr'm
a wathry grave be a tailor be th' name'iv Muggins. He took th'
la'ad be th' ar-rms an' walked ashore with him. Well, tt/
ag'nized parents, not wantin' to appear stingy befure th' neigh
bors, prisinted Muggins with a goold watch an' Muggins become
a hayro. Th' la-ad didn't think much iv it. He'd have done th'
same f'r Muggins. But afther awhile he found that Muggins was
chained to him f'r life. As a boy, he was spoken iv as th' fellow
that had his life saved by Muggins th' tailor. As he grew older
he was still Muggins' boy. Muggins wasn't much to look at, betn'
a little, bow-legged man, but afther he become a hayro, he acted
th' part. Me young frind cudden't get away fr'm him. If he was
playin' baseball in th' corner lot, Muggins was lanin' over th'
fence with an' indulgent smile. Whin he grajated with honors at
th' Brothers School, Muggins set in th' front seat with a look iv
fond attintion on his face. Whin th' Brother Supeeryor handed
out th' first prize, he remarked that it gave him great pleasure
to reward th' ability an' larnin' iv this young man in th' prisince
iv th' hayro to whom he owed his life. It was th' same in after
years. He become a lawyer an' Muggins niver missed a day in
coort. Th' lawyer f'r th' opposition always managed to appeal to
his finer feclin's in th"prisince iv th' man to whom he owed his
life. If it was a suit over a pair iv pants, me frind always lost it.
He niver wud take a case agin a tailor f'r th' jury wud always
vote against him. In pollyticks he thried to succeed but Mug
gins hung on to him. Whin th' chairman iv th' meetin' arose, he
invaryably began: 'Ladies an' gintleman, befure inthrojoocin' th'
speaker iv th' avenin', I want to presint to ye th' man to whom
he owes his life an' who is here on th' platform to-night, Misther
Alphonso Muggins.' Me frind was always supposed to put his
handkerchief to his eyes at these wurruds an' with' falthrin' step
escoort him to th' front. Wan night he tol' me he give Muggins
a kick. He said he cudden't help it. Th' timptation was too
sthrong f'r human endurance. Muggins didn't mind it. He niver
minded annything. He was a hayro.
"Afther awhile he took to dhrink. Habichool hayroes always
do, an' whin in dhrink he was melancholy or quarrelsome, as
dhrunk men an' hayroes sometimes ar-re. Clancy wud be settin'
quitely in a cafe with some friends whin Muggins wud blow in
an' set, down with his hat over his eyes. Th' frind wud have
to inthrajooce him with a catch in, his voice an' a tear in his eyes.
'Boys,' he'd say, 'I want to inthrajooce ye to Alphonse Muggins.
Gawd, bless him, boys, he saved me life.' 'Is that so ?' says wan
iv his companyons. 'Ye betcher life it is,' says Muggins. 'Did
I save his life? Well, ask him. Ye ask him if I did save his life.
Ye just ask him. If he don't lie about it, he'll tell ye who saved
his life. Did I leap into th' ragin' flood an' riscue him at th' risk
iv me life? Maybe I did. Maybe it was a man in Milwaukee
that done that. Looky here. Look at this clock, I got fr'm his
folks, if ye don't believe me. An' what's he done f'r me ? Tell me
that, will ye? Who am I? I'm nothin'. I'm Muggins th' tailor.
An' what's he? Look at him, will ye, with his dimon' pin an' his
plug hat so gay. An' where'd he be if it wasn't for me? But it's
all right, boys. It's all right. Life is a cur'ous place an' grati
chood is a thing unknown.' An' he wud weep an' go to sleep.
Sometimes he wud fight. He punched Clancy two or three times
on account iv his ingratichood. Clancy had to support him an'
bail him out an' get th' clock out iv th' pawnshop ivry Saturday
night. But an end comes to all things. Hayroes don't live long.
They can't th' way they live. An' wan day Muggins wint th f
way iv all our kind, proud an' simple, coward an' brave man,
hayroes an' hayro worshipper. Th' pa-apers had an account iv
his fun'ral. 'Among th' mourners none was more affected thin
Congressman Clancy, whose life, near forty years ago, this hum
ble hayro had saved fr'm a wathry doom in Lake Michigan/ Th'
rayporthers didn't obsarve that Clancy tamped th' grave with his
foot to make sure it was solid. He wint home with a light heart,
an' says to his wife : 'Mother, to-day I begin me rale career. We'
burrid Muggins.' 'But .Cornelius,' says th' good woman, 'ye owed
him ye'er life.' 'P'rapsf,' says Clancy, 'but,' he says, 'he took it
"No, sir, Hinnissy, if ye see me in disthress kindly call f'r
profissyonal help. I'll be riscued be a fireman or a polisman be
cause it's all in their day's wurruk, but amachoor hayroes is a
danger whin they're riscuin' ye an' a worry iver afther. If I
owe me life to annywan let it be to a man who won't thry to
collect it. Annyhow, what is hayroism? If a man stops a run
away team that is dhraggin' an empty milk wagon into a ditch,
he's not a hayro. He's a fool. Th' line is lightly dhrawn anny
how. A hayro is often a succissful fool an' a fool is an unsuc
cessful hayro. I've heard Andhrew Carnaygie called a hayro but
I don't believe it. If he was he wudden t be givin' medals f'r
hayroism. If he was a profissyonal swimmer, he wudden't think
annything iv savin' people fr'm dhrownin'. If he was a fireman
he'd think nawthin' iv carryin' a man down th' fire-escape iv a
burnin' buildin'. If he was a stable boy, he'd find that he'd have
to catch runaway horses or lose his job. I wudden't hesitate to
go down a laddher on ye'er shouldhers but if ye thried to save
me fr'm dhrownin' I'd scream f'r help. What wud I be doin'
thryin' to stop a runaway team? But if ye fell through my coal
hole into me cellar, I'd organize an hayroic riscue. I know th f
way. Hayroes ought to know th' way to be safe. If they do
they don't need anny medals. If they don't, they'd betther turn
"There are hayroes an' hayroes. We're all hayroes more
or less. Ye're a hayro ye'ersilf, towin' those tired feet afther ye

had a medal f'r ivry act iv hayroism she's performed, she'd have

RIDDLE OF THE SERVANT GIRL
I AM glad to see, Mrs. Wilkins," I said, "that tfie Wom
en's Domestic Guild of America has succeeded in solv
ing the servant girl problem â none too soon, one might
say." "Ah," said Mrs. Wilkins, as she took the cover off
the bacon and gave an extra polish to the mustard pot
with her apron, "they are clever people over there. Leastways
so I have always heard." "This, their latest, Mrs. Wilkins," I
said, "I am inclined to regard as their greatest triumph. My
hope is that the Women's Domestic Guild of America, when it
has finished with the United States and Canada, will perhaps
see its way to establishing a branch in England. There are
ladies of my acquaintance who would welcome, I feel sure, any
really satisfactory solution of the problem." "Well, good luck
to it is all I say," responded Mrs. Wilkins, "and if it makes all
the gals contented with their places and all the mistresses satis
fied with what they've got and 'appy in their minds, why, God
bless it!" "The mistake hitherto," I said, "from what I read,
appears to have been that the right servant was not sent to the
right place. What the Women's Domestic Guild of America
proposes to do is to find the right servant for the right place.
You see the difference, don't you, Mrs. Wilkins?" "That's the
secret 1" agreed Mrs. Wilkins. "They don't anticipate any dif
ficulty in getting that right sort' of gal, I. take it?" "I father
not, Mrs. Wilkins," I replied. "There must be plenty of girls of
the right sort."
Mrs. Wilkins is of a pessimistic turn of mind, as I think" I
have before stated. . "I am not so sure about that," she saidj
"the Almighty don*t seem to 'ave made too many of that sort.
Unless these American ladies that you speak of are going to
start a factory of their own I am afraid there is disappointment
in store for them." "Don't throw cold water on the idea before
it is fairly started, Mrs. Wilkins," I pleaded. "Well/sir," said
Mrs. Wilkins, "I 'ave been a gal myself in service, and in my
time I've 'ad a few mistresses of my own, and I've 'eard a good
deal about others. There are ladies and ladies, as you may
know, sir, and some of them, if they aren't exactly angels, are
about as near to it as can be looked for in this climate, and they
are not the ones that do most of the complaining. But as for
the average mistress â well, it ain't a gal she wants; it's a plaster
image, without any' natural innardsâ a sort of thing as ain't
'uman and ain't to be found in 'uman nature. And then she'd
grumble at it if it didn't 'appen to be able to be in two places
at once." "You fear that the standard for that 'right girl' is likely
to be set a trifle too high, Mrs. Wilkins," I suggested. "That
right gal, according to the notions of some of 'cm, retorted Mrs.
Wilkins, "'er place ain't down 'ere among us mere mortals ; 'er
place is up in 'caven with a 'an> and a golden crown I"
"But how is it," I argued,, "that in hotels, for instance,
the service is excellent, and the girls, generally speaking, seem
contented? The work is hard and the wages not much better,
if as good."
"Ah," said Mrs. Wilkins, "you 'ave 'it the right nail on the
'ead there, sir. They go into the hotels and work like niggers,
knowing that if a single thing goes wrong they will be bully
ragged and sworn at- till they don't know whether they are
standing on their 'eads or their 'eels. But they 'ave their
hours; the gal" knows when 'er work is done, and when the
clock strikes she is a 'uman being once again."
"I see your point, Mrs. Wilkins," I said t "and, of course, in
a house where two or three servants were kept, some such
plan might easily be arranged. The girl who commenced work
one month at 6 o'clock in the morning might consider herself
free at 6 o'clock in the evening and be perfectly free. What
she- does "with herself, how she dresses herself, in her own time,
that is her affair. What church the clerk or the workman be
longs to, what company he keeps, is no concern of the firm.
The mistress who thinks it her duty to combine the roles of
employer and of maiden aunt is naturally resented. The next
month the girl would change her hours from 12 till 12, and her
fellow servant would enjoy the 6 a. m. to 6 p. m. shift. But how
do you propose to deal, Mrs. Wilkins, with the smaller menage,
that employs only one servant?"
"Well, sir," said Mrs. Wilkins, "it seems to me simple
enough. Ladies talk pretty about the dignity of labor and are
never tired of pointing out why gals should prefer domestic
service to all other kinds of work. Suppose they practice what
they preach. In the house where there's only the master and
the mistress, and say a couple of small children, let the lady
take her turn. After all, it's only her duty, same as the office
or the shop is the man's. Where, on the other hand, there are
biggish boys and gals about the place â well, it wouldn't do
them any 'arm to be taught to play a little less and to look
after themselves a little more. It's just arranging things-â
that's all that's wanted."
"You remind me of a family I once knew, Mrs. Wilkins, n
I said ; "it consisted of the usual father and mother and of five
sad, healthy girls. They kept two servants â or, rather, they;
never kept any servants; they lived always looking for ser
vants, breaking their hearts over servants, packing servants off
at a moment's notice, standing disconsolately looking after ser
vants who had packed themselves off at a moment's notice,
wondering generally what the world was coming to. It oc
curred to me at the time that, without much trouble, they
could have lived a peaceful life without servants. The eldest
girl was learning painting and seemed unable to learn any
thing else. It was poor sort of painting; she noticed it herself.
But she seemed to think that, if she talked a lot about it and
thought of nothing else, that somehow it would all come right.
The second girl played the violin. She played it from early
morning till late evening, and friends fell away from them.
There wasn't a spark of talent in the family, but they all had a
notion that a vague longing to be admired was just the same
as genius. Another daughter fancied she would like to be an
actress and screamed all day in the attic The fourth wrote
poetry on a typewriter and wondered why nobody seemed to
want it ; while the fifth one suffered from a weird belief that
smearing wood with a redhot sort of poker was a thing worth
doing for its own sake. All of them seemed willing enough to
work, provided only that it was work of no use to any living
soul. With a little sense and the occasional assistance of a
charwoman they could have led a merrier life."
"If I was giving away secrets," said Mrs. Wilkins, "I'd
say to the mistresses, 'Show yourselves able to be independent/
It's because the gals know that the mistress can't do without
them that they sometimes give themselves airs."

"Ssh, be still! I think .I've got a

him. "Take this line, will you?"
He stepped down into the boat and
reached toward her. . Deftly she seized
the oars and pushed off from shore.
"There's a string of fish down here
that I couldn't pull in by myself." she
announced, as he sat down hard. And
the boat shot out Into the stream,

horrified on the -bank.

GUY WETMORE'S FIND

"Yes," assented the latter, : wonder-
Ing why he should be forced into his
friend's lie.- â¢
"How's that?" asked Tobyn, frown
ing a look Into the face of the com
placent Larraby.
"Well, neither owner is backing his

had advised. "I can't win and I am
almost certain to lose a little."
He wondered why in the world lie
wasn't clever enough to think, of some
scheme to score over Grant and the
other fellows who were always putting
him onto dead things. The only thing
he could do would be to wring some
of their necks, but that would be bad
form. It meant showing that he had
lost his temper because he got a bit
the worst of it; that wouldn't be toler
ated in the Hundredth Hussars. Why
the deuce wasn't he clever enough to
score? By Jove, it was really aggra
vating. Then he backed Rocket for
1000. and felt that he was pretty well
back at the beginning again. How
ever, It was better than losing. He
didn't^'nind the money so much as the
known fact of his persistency in never
picking a winner.
He was in this irregular frame of
mind when Larraby spotted him.
"Here's sport," muttered the latter to
himself and he heliographed a friend,
Dixon, to Join him. "What have you
backed, Tobyn?" asked Larraby, solici
tously.
"Backed them both," answered the
Babe, laconically.
"Pegu, what else?" queried Larraby.
"Pegu be hanged! ' I haven't touched
that crock," he answered, with flnÂ«
scorn in his voice. "I got on Amir
first, thanks to Grant, and then Lavel
assured me that he had no chance,
and I put a thou' on the Rocket, to
save the Amir money."
"Then you'll be Just. 2000 out," said
Larraby, solemnly; "2000 of her Majes
ty's rupeesâ won't he, Dixon?"
horse. I know for a fact, because I*va
been watching; and that means any
thing you like. Besides, Pegu can run
like a streak of blue lightning. He's
got " a lightweight on his back, and
he'll get away from them so far they'll
never catch him in this heavy going."
"Oh, lie's a Tair game," answered
Larraby lightly. "I like to see him
dropping his sovs about. I'll tell. this
down at the mess to-night â how the
Babe backed all the horses In a race
and expected to win."
The more Tobyn thought It over the
more it occurred to him that he ought
to back Pegu. If he didn't and the
latter won, by Jove, he'd have backed
two losers out of three runners. Great
Ramal they would laugh at him; he'd
never hear the last of it. Also he'd
lose 2000 â 1000 over each of the
horses. If he backed Pegu now he
could only lose 1000 â he must find the
winner, then, as Larraby had said.
And, of course, if Pegu -won, he'd win
20,000. He'd do it. So he had 1000
on "the outsider" at 20 to 1.
The bookmaker chuckled softly to
himself when he booked the bet.
"That's 1000 out of the fire," he said.
"The other two are running for each
other; this Is my profit." If the gods
would only send him a few more rich
young asses like the Babe, he'd soon
quit the game.
Then the true fun be gar, for it waa
really more comedy than race. Jockey
Blake rode Amir, and "Scotty** Lewis
was on Rocket. Now bear In mind that
Amir's owner had backed Rocket, and
Rocket's owner had backed Amir, and
that jockeys generally racive explicit
"You'll . think he'll win?" queried
Tobyn. .
"Win? Of course he will; he'll walk
in. Tou'd better put 1000 on him
and make a haul; he's 20 to 1. Have
a plunge. At any rate you'll have
backed the" three" of them, and must
get. a winner.
"What did you do that for?" asked
Dixon as they . turned away from
Tobyn. You know Pegru was only put
in to make, up the race." â¢
âand men said the betting mill would
be a big one. That was, between Amir
and ltocktt particularly. The "Raii
xvay Plate" was a mile on the flat, a
distance v. hirji suited both horses.
Pegru was supposed to lie down and roll
over after he had gone a half mile, for
that was his limit â five furlongs at the
Ktty outside. The terms of the race
called for three starters, and that was
really v. hy Pegu had been put in. He
was, as it were, a subsidized interest,
and being a forlorn runner a native
Jockey was thought good enough to
pilot him, and much cheaper. That's
what Henry, his owner, thought; so he
put up Abdul, little better than a sta
ble boy, who only knew enough to sit in
the saddle and let the horse use his
oÂ« n discretionâ which, after all, is not
such a very bad thing.
Before the race John, the owner of
Amir, took counsel with himself. It
* ould be a near thiijg between his
horse and Rocket â either might win.
He could not depend on Amir's win
ning, but he could upon Rocket's. In
fact, he quite convinced himself that
Rocket had much the better chance; so.
through a friend, he backed the other
man's horse heavily. It was a thor
oughly sound enterprise, based on ob
vious principles. But James was not so
sure arxnjt Rocket winning as was his
friend John. He had uneasy qualms
about the horse. What if Amir could
stay the mile â he was certainly faster
tha.n Rocket? It was too risky; he
Tx ould back the better horee. Amir. So
he sent a trusty henchman, who loaded
up the willing "bookies" with bets on
John's horse, AmJ*\ It was a generous
thing to do, this -tracking of each oth
er's horses; an unselfish thing; and
they hid their good under a bushel; did
not let the right hand know what the
left vas doingâ said not a word to each
other. Of course, the result of this
steady plunge on the part of the own
ers caused Amir and Rocket to rule
close favorites in the betting. It was
.6 to 5 on â take your choice. Also be
cause of this and because he really
hadn't a ghost of a chance. Pegu glided
out in the betting until he was 20 to i.
This was a charming sort of arrange
ment for the Babe to wander up
against. He had a happy faculty of
finding intricate combinations of this
sort, and his supreme indifference to
results and complete faith in his own
ability usually run him hard and fast
on the sunken rock. When he asked a
friend what he should back the friend
blithely answered: "Amir-iiothing
e!se In it." That being so. he felt that
he must do something substantial; so
he had 1000 rupees on the horse. It
was an exhilarating start, and he
whistled cheerfully >as he walked
around to the front of the stand.
"You are happy." said Captain Lav el,
meeting him on the grass promenade, j
"Tee." answered Tobyn. "I've Just
backed the winnerâ that is. to be."
"What's the good thing?" asked
Lavcl.
"Amir; Grant says he can't lose."
"Now, look here," exclaimed Label,
half anirrily, "Grant's" an ass. Amir
hasn't a thousand-to-one chance. I
know him, for I used to own him. He
can't stay the distance; seven-eighths
is as far as he can get. He'll crack
up a furlong from home at the pace
Rocket'llset him.'.' - ,â¢â¢;â¢,
He looked with angry compassion
into, the face of Tobyn, and the latter
drew the toe of his boot thoughtfully
acrqss the grass, making Maltese
crosses, as though he .would force his
thought into- some sort of shape.
Lavel's information had staggered him.
What the deuce did Grant mean . by
putting him onto a horse like thatâ
onto a dead one? Then he remembered
that Grant had taken a rise out of him
once or twice before. However, ~ evi
dently Lavel knew about the runners,
so he asked, "What shall I do?"
"Why, go back Rocket," advised the
captain. "Play to get even. Back him
for 1000 or enough to pay your losings
over Amir. I shouldn't do any more
on this sort of a race, if I were you,"
and he sauntered over to the marquee,
for all this talking made him dry.
"This Is noÂ» Â«nd of a' fool's -game I"
WHEN* the other fellows in the
One Hundredth Hucsars be
stowed upon Harry Tobyn the
artless rame of â¢"Babe," they
considered that, vith full regard to his
exuberant innocence, they had let him

from his exploit with an elephant. Tha

and tu had Babe â sometimes. The re
sult was that men who were buried at
10 o'clock the next day laughed that
day. But this is a story of the Babe
snd three horses, not the elephant.
Bear in mind that Tobvn was in the
first flush of the glamour of life in
India. The ethics of betting, the
subtle uncertainty of racing the per
plexing art of knowing just what to
do at the right moment were all tum
bling in upon him with the cyclonic vio

who could almost do the "mango tree

"I'm ridin' 'cording to orders." an
swered Scotty sulkily. "Go on your
self."
"Did the old man order you to
throw the jtace away?" queried Blakft
petulantly wrenching at Amir's mouth.
"He told me not to throw It away
makln* the runnm' fer you."
While they wrangled their horses
jumped sideways, like a lady's palfrey,
because, their noses being pulled down
on their chests, Abdul was stealing
away into the distance like a soft,
gray shadow. Luckily for him. he
never looked back in any race so long
as he was ahead, but kept pegging
away, like a true native. All the time
he thought the sahibs were at his
heels, ready for a surging rush as they
swept Into "the straight." And Into
"the straight." and still no sign of the
sahibs. What if his mount should
win! Ha had put ten rupees on him
with the bookmakers. Tha odds, SO
to 1, had tempted him; besides, was It
not the horse he was going to rideâ
and had ha not ten rupees of eonfl
dence In himself?
A serious problem had opened op for
the other two boys to consider. Be
cause of astral communication. Blkks
knew that his employer would win it
Rocket won; and Scotty also knew
that Amir's winning would benefit hia
master. Also were the Jockeys In tl i
same boat, because of arrangement.
Then tha third factor In the problem
appeared, or. In point of fact, was dis
appearing â the native boy on Pegu.
Blake saw this and realized that he
would have to at least save second
money. If Rocket would not go en he
would, so he set sail for tha leader.
Scotty followed. They made up ground
rapidly, but the gray hung on sur
prisingly. Would they ever catch him?
In the stand the excitement was ter
rific, Nobody had backed Pegu â nobody
but the Babe. It was the stand against
the Babe, the fast horses against the
dead one, the Jockeys against the na
tive boy. It was tragically unique, this
race of the wise men against the lambs.
Jump by Jump Amir and Rocket re
duced the lead the gray outcast had.
Abdul could hear something coming
now â something thundering along
behind him: still far enough away so
that he need not pull out. as he had al
ways done. It was not far to the win
ning post â would the gray last? He
thought of the 200 rupees he would win,
and swore by Allah that he would give
half of It In charity, if Allah would only
breathe Into the nostrils of the gray
and fill his lungs with strength.
The two jockeys were riding for sec
ond place now; that was about all they
could see in 1L The stand^ mad with
excitement, thought they were riding to
win; though it was either rare horse
manship, this waiting race, or elÂ»n
sheer stupidity. If the native won, ?,
would be stupidity; If -either of the
Jockeys won, his backers would label
it "splendid horsemanship."
It was stupidity. As the gray Just
tottered under the wire first, the other
two finished like lions, nose and nose,
in a dead heat for second money. Then
pandemonium broke loose in the stand,
all the backers' money was burned up.
No, not all! Babe Tobyn bad 18.000 to
draw out of the flames. There he stood,
the only winner among all those clever
racing men â the Babe.
. Imagination needs no word-prick to
picture what the owners of Amir and
Rocket thought and said. Down at the
mess that night there waa no hilarity
when Babe Tobyn walked in; only the
hush of awe. Such luck as that clear
ly indicated the finger of Allah. He
had passed through his novitiate, and
they were abashed.
Down on Amir, Blake -was swearing
softly to himself. At last he spoke.
"Why don't you go on. Scotty? Can't
you see that native slipping away from
us? He's got twenty lengths the be3t
of it now."
Tobyn saw the gray opening up- a
Â¦wide stretch of country between him
self and the other two horses and go-
Ing up to Larraby congratulated him
upon hi3 perspicacity. "By Jove!" he
exclaimed, "you're a good one at pick-
Ing them. They'll never catch Pegu
now. I suppose you've backed him
yourself?"
Larraby's face was a study, but tha
Babe didn't notice this; he never ex
plored faces.
"All right, come along th-n." yelled
Blake, letting go of Amir's head a lit
tle.
They were only cantering; and all
the time the iron gray Pegu, with tha
black boy on hi3 back, was slipping
away from them. People in the stand,
seeing the state of things, thought It
was a false start, and bantered cheer
fully over the idiocy of 4 the native boy,
Abdul. "It doesn't make any differ
ence," some one said; "Pegu had no
chance anyway."
Instructions from their owners, before
they go out, as to how they are to ride
the race â always on the square, my
masters. Blake thought that a bad
start would suit him capitally: Scotty
meant to get av.ay absolutely last;
three or four lengths the worst of the
start would be a good excuse for hav
ing been beaten.
Abdul couldn't understand it. The
few minutes at the starting post had
always been more or less of a night
mare to him; the sahibs used such bad
language and justled so. He had al
ways started at t*- tail end of the pro
cession, leavinj the front seats to tha
jockey sahibs. Now they told him to
move up in front, and v.-ere deuced po
lite to each otherâ most sacrificing in
keeping their horses in the background,
out of the other fellow's way. The
sahibs were a mighty queer lot any
way. Abdul thought; quite mad, all of
them.
When the flag tell Abdul cut out the
running with Fegu at a furious dip.
He would stay in front of the sahibs
as long as he could. Blake took a pull
at Amir's head. "What are you wait
ing for?" called out Scotty on Rocket.
"I thought it was a false start," an
swered Blake, "seeing you hanging
back there."
"Oh, the start's all right." said Scotty
angrily. "Go on!"

story of the same genre. In nearly

Mrs. Dillon, in her story of "The

historical romance which is what we
tritely term timely, for it fits in with
the St. Louis Exposition by being a
novel of the period of the Louisiana
purchase. It Is built up out of a close
study of the best historical records of
these days, and brings before us the
important men of the timeâ Napoleon,
Jefferson. Talleyrand, Marbois and
Lewis and Clark, also the famous In
dian'chief Black Hawk, to add a touch
of picturesqueness. There is, of
course, the usual pretty love story to

Possessed with- '.the determination'' to
exhibit some of the anomalies of the
present day social order, Mr. Payne
has strung together into a. story, euf
ficiently dreary, a series of incidents,
disconnected, unbalanced, which have
to center about. the personality of no
individual in particular. and which lead
to nothing worthy of being denominat
ed a definite conclusion. One of the
personages cf his story, Alonzo A.
Farscrn, is a caricature, pure and sim
ple, a translation of Mr.. Pecksniff Into
the atmosphere of windy Chicago,, and
all of the incidents, the dialogue in
which this character has a : part are
consequently unreal to the limit of
farcical. As for the. rest of his people,
Payne has tried to instill the exalted
essence of spirituality into a lady ven
dor c-f cigars, sublimated Bohemian
is:n into a very commonplace fiddler
and the delicate savor of chivalry into
a buyer and seller of meat on the hoof.
The creatures of his conjuring refuse

Nobody denies Mr. Payne the premise
that under the dome of the Pan
theon Hotel in Chicago there may be
lite worthy of study and reflection In
a novel. Frank Norris found a stir

San Francisco. If the author believes
that In, a "Cinderella of Cigars" there
is the ..worth for a story, nobody can
say him nay. Only let him endow his
"Duchess" -with sensibilities and ap
preciations commensurate with her
mental caliber, In keeping â¢with the
sphere of life settled upon her by the
accident of birth, and then go ahead in
the weaving of a story that may have
the stamp of the natural about it. In

to write from the respective social

friends. After leaving Bryn Mawr, Misj
Potter spent a year or two In post
graduate studies lni-Atin, Greek, Eng
lish, history and philosophy with a pri

the philosophy of most of the ancient

est distinction of her books arises from
their power to recreate the color and

"A firm of American publishers has
addressed a letter to a London paper
complaining of the fashion in which
American books are treated by English
reviewers. The question affects the
whole subject of criticism, and the
method in which reviewers are remun
erated for their laborious work by cer
tain newspapers; but it also draws at
tention to the larger and more im
portant subject of American litera
ture. It must have struck many ob
servers how very slight and'inconsid
erable is the American contribution to
the eternal things of art. In labor
saving inventions, and in all the com
mercial details of the shop and the
factory, the American nation enjoys a
reputation which is Justifiably envied
in Europe. But . their art and their
literature have not yet made, any seri
ous impression upon the world. It is
true that Mr. Henry James- is an
American by birth, but he was edu
cated in France and lives In England;
and this is a qualifying statement
which also applies to those few bril
liant painters who were born in Ameri
ca. There is probably some spirit in
the atmosphere of the American con
tinent which is antagonistic to art.
There Is no sense of age, very little
veneration, and an entire absence of
restfulness throughout the United
States. It is quite certain that when
America does produce a work of genius
it will need no service of the reviewer
to introduce it into Europe."
We, Americans, then, who sit In
darkness, probably do not get the genu
ine British literary creme-de-la-creme.

McNeal" don't behave, report 1 him'.- to
me and he'll get his time."
It was a favorite trick of Neighbor's.
Whenever the, old /fireman got to

ter mechanic threatened to - discharge
the engineer. That settled it; Dad

After we got hold of Foley, Neighbor
put him on a while -with Dad, and the
grizzled fireman quickly declared that
Foley was the only man on the pay
roll who knew how to move a train.
The little chap proved such a re
markable find that I tried hard to get
some of his Eastern chums to come out
and join him. After a good: bit of
hustling -we did get-half a dozen more
ReaffSug boys for our new corps of
engine men, but' the East End officials
kept all but one of them on. their own
divisions. â¢â¢= That one we got because no
body on the East End wanted him.
"They've crimped the whole bunch,
Foley," said I, answering his inquiries.
"There's just one fellow reported here;
he came in. on, 5 this morning. ' Â¦ Neigh
bor's had a little talk -with him; but
he doesn't think much of him. I guess
we're out the transportation on that
fellow." c
"What's his name 1 " asked Foley. t ."Is
he off the # Reading?"
"Claims'he is; his name is McNealâ"
"McNeal?" ~ echoed Foley, surprised.
v "Not Georgie McNeal?*! ;
â¢. "I don't^now what his first name is;
he's nothing but a boy."
â "Dark comDlexioned fellow?" \
"Perhaps you'd call him that; sort
of soft-spoken."
"Georgie McNeal, sure's you're born.
If . you've got him you've got a bird.

Srtth an engineer, fired religiously.
No other man in the service could
have done it without getting killed,
but Pa*' was old enough to father any
man among the Btrikers. Moreover,
he was a giant physically, and eccen
tric enough to move along through the
heat of the crisis Indifferent enough
to the abuse of the other men. His
tray hairs aad his tremendous physi
cal Btrength saved him from personal
violence.
Our master mechanic, Neighbor, was
another big manâ six feet and an inch
in his stockingsâ and strong as a draw
bar. Eetween Neighbor and the old
fireman there existed some sort of a
bondâ a liking, an affinity. Dad Ham
ilton had fired on our division ten
years. There was no promotion for
Dad: he could never; be an engineer,
though only Neighbor knew why. But
his job of firing on the river division
â¢was sure as long as Neighbor signed
the payrolls at the roundhouse. *
Hence there was no surpVise when
the superintendent offered him an en
gine just after theotrike that Dad re
fused to take it.
"I'm a fireman, and NeighbS' knows
It. I ain't no engineer. I make steam
for any man you put in the cab with
me, but I won't touch a throttle for
any man. I laid it down, an' I'll never
pinch it againâ an' no offense t' you.
Neighbor, neither."
Thus ended negotiations with Dad on
that subject: threats, entreaties were
useless. Then, too, in spite of his pro
fessed willingness to throw coal for
any man we put on his engine, he
v,as continually rowing about the green
runners we gave him. From the stand-
"They'd. .never .have done It if they
thought -Uh' ere ;,w'as ' any danger, of
Dad's getting after them. They know
he doesn't like the boy."
"It's an outrage,^ but we can't do
anything. You "know that. â¢ Tell Mc-
Neal to keep away from , the postof
fice. We'll get his mail for r him."
"I told him that this morning. He's
in bed, and looks p'retty* hard. But he
won't dodge those Â¦"fellows.'-. He claims
It's a free . country," . grinned..- Foley.
"But I told him he'd get over that idea
if he stuck out this. trouble."
It was three days before McNealvwas
able to report to work,' though he re
ceived full time -just the same. Even
then he wasn't fit for duty, but he
begged Neighbor for his run until he
got it. The strikers were jubilant
while the boy was laid up, but just
what Dad : thought no one could find
out. I wanted to tell . thie . old growler
what I thought of him, but Foley said
it wouldn't do any good, and might do
harm, so I held my peace. . ! *."
One might have thought that the in
justice- and brutality of the "thing
would have roused him, but men: who
have repressed themselves till they are
gray-headed don't " rise . in . a hurry to
resent a wrong. Dad kept as mute as
.the Sphinx. When McNeal was ready
to go out the old fireman had the 244
shining, *,but if the pale face of his en
gineer had any effect on him he kept It
to himself. ,: v;-
As they rattled down the line with
a' long stock train that night neither
of them : referred , to the break in their
run. Coming back next night the same
silence hung over the cab. The only
Â¦word that passed over the bollerhead
â¢was /'strictly business," as Dad . would
say. â¢
At Oxford they were laid out by a
Pullman special It was* 3 o'clock in
the morning and raining hard. .Under
such 1 circumstances an hour seems all
night. At last Dad himself broke. the
unsupportable silence.
,' "He'd have waited a good bit longer
if he* had "waited for me to talk," Bald
the boy, telling* Foley afterward.
â¢'Heard you got licked," growled Dad,
after tinkering with the fire for the
twentieth time.
"I didn't get licked," retorted Geor-
Sle;. "I got clubbed. I never had a
chance to light."
"These fellows hate : to see a boy
come out and take a man's job. Can't
blame 'era much, neither." â¢
"Whose job did I J take?" Remanded
Georgie, angrily. "Was any one of
those cowards' that jumped on me in
-the dark looking for work on this en
gine?" â¢â¢Â¦ Â¦ â¢ . :
â¢' There was nothing to say to that.
Dad kept still. Â»
. "You talk about men," continued
the young fellow. "If I am not more
of a man than to slug a fellow from
behind, the way they slugged me, 1*11
get off this engine and stay off. If
that's what you call men out here I
don't want to be a man. I'll go back
to Pennsylvania."
"Why didn't you stay there?"
growled Dad.
"Why didn't you?"
Without attempting to return the,
shot Dad pulled nervously at the
chain.
' "If. I hadn't been fool enough to go
out on strike I might have been run
ning there yet," continued Georgie.
"Ought to have kept away from the
postofflce," grumbled Dad, after a
pause.
"I get a letter twice a week that I
think more of than I do for this whole
road, and I propose to go to the post
office' and get it without asking any
body's permission."
"They'll pound you again."
Georgie looked out Into the storm.
"Well, why shouldn't they? I've
got no friends."
"Got a girl back in Pennsylvania?"
â¢ - "Yes. I 'vegot a girl there," replied
the boy, as the rain tore at the cab
window. "I've had a girl there a good
â¢while. She's grayheaded and 60 years
oldâ that's my girlâ and if she ~can
write letters' to me I can get them out
of the postoffice without a guardian."
"There she comes," said Dad, as the
headlight of the Pullman special shone
faint ahead through the mist.
"I'm mighty glad of it," said Georgie,
looking at his watch. "Give me steam
now, .Dad. and I'll get you home in
time for a nap before breakfast."
A minute later thÂ» Special shot vrÂ»r

rfiitcr Shipping Tl'orlfl In London Delly Mall.
THE value, of holding the "blue
riband" of the Atlantic, or the
record for the fastest voyage. Is
considerable. It may give to the
holder, or to the flag which covers this
fastest ship, an importance at once ex
aggerated and mirleading.
L*t me particularize in a sentence or
two. The Dcutschland. belonging to
the Hamburg-American Line, holds Ihe
trans- Atlantic time recordâ in spite of
the fine steaming performance of the
Kciser Wilhelm II the other dayâ with
a voyage from Sandy Hook to Ply
mouth, covered in five days seven
hours end thlrty-e^ht minutes; : the
Kronprinz Wilhelm of the N'ord
deutscher Lluyd coming within one
hour and twenty minutes of the record,
with a voyage also from Sandy Hook
to Plymouth, covered in five days ei?ht
hours and eighteen minutes. Against
that we have tfce Lucania doing: the
westward passage in five days seven
hours and twenty-three minutes; and
the Campania, her sister ship. Jn five
days nine hours and six minutes. But
when, distance and direction are fairly
considered it is admitted without con
troversy that the two German boats
hold the first and second places for
speed over the Atlantic. Â¦ Out of these
and other instances of speed supremacy
Germany has gained an immense ad-
vantage in the way of advertisement
for her passenger steamers, while, as I
have said, creating a misleading im>
press-ion throughout the world concern
ing the place of her shipping among
the merchant navies of the world. For
example, if we take the steam tonnage
of the United Kingdom and Germany
of twelve-knot speed and upward, we
find our total to be 4,286.121 tons
against 893,707 tons sailing under the
German flag. Moreover/ our preptm-
derance over the rest of the world in
potential carrying power is Â¦ Â¦ equal "^.- to
3.2S4.000 tons, figures representing .more
than the 1 whole v of Germany's steam
and sail shipping. â¢ v â¢ . .
It must, however, be freely admitted
that, enjoying bb they have done a
substantial monopoly, especially in
first-class passenger traffic, the fast
steamers of the two great German
companies have been successful as
commercial ventures.. Nor have their
advantages been confined to the conti
nental trade; Calling at English ports,
advantageously situated, they have
been able to do a large amount of busi
ness in the passenger trade of the
United Kingdom. Our great lines,, on
the other hand, have pursued a differ
ent policy, going largely into tonnage
of lower 'speed'' and greater' carrying
power, vessels represented by the Ced
ric arid the" Celtic, with a speed of sev
enteen knots, belonging to the White
Star line, and the. Saxonia and the
Ivernia, , with a speed of fifteen knots,
belonging to the Cunard fleet. These
vessels have proved commercially 'suc
cessful, capable of earning dividends,
whlfe .the flyers of, our fleets often left
the balance on the wrong side of the
ledger.
But the transfer of speed supremacy
from the British to the German flag
has undoubtedly offended the publib
sentiment of this country and our
shipowners have been blamed for what
has been thought to beUheir failure to
hold their own; the fact being that
they pursued what they conceived to
be, and which, undoubtedly, has been,
the best! commercial policy. Finally,
however, an arrangement was entered
into between the Government, repre.
sented by the president of the Board of
Trade, and the Cunard Company,
which, briefly stated, is to the 'follow
ing purport:
go and 3000 passengers, while the Kais
er Wilhelm II carries ,but very little
cargo and her passenger accommoda
tion is less than 2000.' To gain her ex
tra speed, equal to about 40 per cent.
the German vessel requires 230 more
hands, while burning about 190 per
cent more coal than her slower rival.
The cost of the Kaiser Wilhelm II may
be fairly given at Â£1,800.000; that will
be about the price of each of the new
Cunarders. It may be stated that one
THE GREATEST ATLANTIC LINER
The Cunard Company undertook to
build two steamers having a speed of
twenty-five knots and to be available
for . service under the Government
whenever called upon, conditional upon
the Government paying a subsidy of
Â£150,000 a year and lending to the
Cunard Company an amount equal to
the cost of the. two ships at a rate of
interest of 2%. per cent, the money thus
advanced to be secured by the ships
of the Cunard fleet.
The cost of extra speed is one of
staggering importance, little under
stood by the general public. By mak
ing a brief comparison between the
Cedric and the Kaiser Wilhelm II this
fact may be demonstrated. The Cedric
on her load draught of 36 feet 6 inches
displaces 37,870 tons, while the Kaiser
Wilhelm II at her load draught of 29
feet only displaces 26,000 tons, the
smaller vessel costing about 30 per
cent more than the Cedric with her
12,000 greater displacement tonnage.
The Cedric can carry 18,000 tons of car-
ef these is to ba built by tha Tynealda
firm, Messrs. Swan. Hunter & Wig
ham Richardson and tha other by
Messrs. John Brown & Ca. of
Clydebank. They will bo substantially
larger as well as faster than tho Kaiser
Wilhelm II; each of them win measura
760 feet long by 83 feet beam, and will,
therefore, displace about 32,000 tons, or
6000 tons more than the Kaiser Wil
helm II. In the matter of speed, again,
they will show a superiority equal to
one and three-fourths knots; tha speed
of the Kaiser Wilhelm n being twenty
three and one-fourth knots, while thÂ«
new Cunarders are being built to do
twenty-five knots in smooth water.
The question of motive power was
one of first Importance, and required,
as it received, a great deal of consid
eration. A commission of experts wero
Invited together to examine the sub
ject. Finally the award was given to
the turbine and the contracts havo
been signed. Three groups of cylindri
cal boilers supply the st?fam for be
tween 65,000 and 70,000 i.h.p.; draught
will be forced by Howden's system;
and It is estimated that the machinery.
Including the boilers and auxiliaries,
will cost about Â£630,000. The advo
cates of the turbine argrao that this
class of machinery possesses advan
tages over reciprocating engines bear
ing a relationship to the increase of
speedâ the higher the speed the great
er the advantage; while, in another di
rection, there will be a substantial
economy of space available for cargo
and for passengers. Although we read
of the turbine in ancient history and
story, we knew nothing of It as a sub
stitute for engines until a few years
ago. Great will ba the rejoicing of the
British race when the turblned
Cunarders shall win back again for
us the "blue riband" of the Atlantic.

JL the body of the patientâ not by
the treatment of the disease. The med
ical profession does not admit that
there has been Â¦ discovered a specific
remedy that will cure consumption. In
the absence of such a remedy, the doc
tors at Fort Btanton call upon nature
to aid the work of medicine. Tho whole
gist of the treatment Is: build up the
general tone of the body to a point
where the system, of Its own accord,
Trill throw off the disease.
To accomplish this, three things have
been found to be of paramount im
portance. They are: rest, outdoor life,
Tvholesome food.
Consumption is the most devastating
to the system of all the diseases to
â¢which the human body Is heir. It not
only cats up the lungs, but it reduces
the vitality of its victim to the lowest

ical science ought to realize that a
body In which the vitality is badljr Im
paired should not be taxed- further,
bat should be given absolute rest, In
order that the remaining strength be
permitted to fight the disease.
The question of f6od for a consump
tive is even more simple than the ques
tion of rest.- He should receive plain,
well -cooked, nutritious, tissue-building
foodâ the same food th'at is given a

The home that should be a happy

as a cold storage plant and the man

The neatness and spick and span

that as long as it remains his exclu

There are two inanimate yet animate
objects.that a man loves better than
he ever did or will love his mbther-In

comes to his cigar and his newspaper
There are many homeless husbands
wandering about like poor little, neg
lected orphans, whose wives are to
blame If they seek more congenial re
treats where the cigar and themselves
are both at home.
A man also likes to feel in the
eyes of the woman he loves and who
loves him that to her he is the one
and only good thing that ever hap
pened. Then, too, he likes to think
himself vastly her superior, although
he may know full well that he is not.
He. wants to be deferred to as if his
opinions were quotations from Holy
Writ and the woman who Is tactful
may let him enjoy the comfort of
thinking so by refraining from ex
pressing any contrary opinions and de

It is always the woman who humors

SOLVE MYSTERY OF SPHINX
POR 2000 years and more the be
lief has prevailed all over the civ
ilized world that the marvelous
figure of the Sphinx was intended
to represent a woman; but this theory
is now forever dispelled through the in
qulsltiveness of the<well-known Ameri
can student of antiquity. Colonel Ram,
who has Just solved the greatest enig
ma that ever perplexed mankind.
The great Image has fallen from Its
height of mighty mysteriousness, to be
shown by unassailable proof to be
nothing but a colossal portrait of Ra-
Harmachis, which, as god of the morn
ing and conqueror of darkness, faces
the rising sun.
Colonel Ram, whose discovery has
now made him world famous, has been
for some time past making excavations
around the Sphinx, but not until re
cently did he succeed in finally uncov
ering the foundations of the great
statue and' bringing to light many In
teresting features which were previous
ly unknown.
The haunting secrecy which has en
shrouded the . Sphinx for centuries
Colonel Ram has successfully pene
trated, but not until men had given
their lives to the attempt to unravel it.
legends and stories had been born in its
shadow and had died, and books, works
of a lifetime, had been completed and
destroyed and other equally ponderous
works raised on their ashes.
Colonel Ram. while he was removing
this fascinating. veil, has supplied the
Sphinx with a history the interest of
which quite makes up for the loss of
the mystery. â¢
Among the heretofore unknown fea
tures ot the stone figure which he has
just brought to light is the temple sur
rounding the* base, which was intended
for the worship of Harmachls, and sev
eral chambers u .?*vÂ» 'a the rock which
were the tombs of Klsgs and priests
devoted to his worship.
Colonel Ram had already discovered
a stone cap with a sacred asp carved
on the forehead, which oneÂ© covered
the head of the Sphinx like a royal
helmet, and must have added to Ita
grandeur, particularly If it was glided.
as the colonel believes.
The Sphinx is net an Independent
structure. The body and head aro
actually hewn out of the solid rock, but
much sandstone masonry was built In
to make the outlines perfect and cover
defects in the material. This reinforce
ment of the original rock is apparent
now to a close observer, but originally
they were concealed, for scientists be
lieve the entire Image was once cov
erad with enamel. Indeed. It Is yet
possible to find fragments still adhering
to the surface which resemble the
porcelain tiles found in tombs and tha
rjÂ«rÂ« of th? ancient palaces.
and front, is built on one of the sound-
excellence, because every movement
and every breath is c. joy, fraught with
Interest and excitement and Intense
pleasure. Every physical culture
teacher will tell you that to be suc
cessful a system of exercises must con
tain a thought and a purpose. That is
v.hat gardening does contain. In her
Irtcns* dssire to sÂ»-e the slander green
LMncs sprout the fashionable gar
dt?i:eES works with double vigor. Her
muscles are not driven by duty. They
cxpaad and contract unconsciously,
nnd thereby become straight and hard
and full of t>ov.cr. After the vigorous
tusslt v.-hh rake and hoe, with v.eed
and plant, heÂ£ rest is ten times more
blissful and beneficial. She Hings her
.<Â¦â¢ .IT down to sleep with complete relax
i.iio:i iLziC abandon, or sits down to cat
wftb the tri& apjynite of a farmer.
No irstruct'T in physical culture is
?"OU.il to a good, old-fassh.ion.cd rake.
T-> mike the exercise doubly beneficial,
when raking let the little gardener
keÂ«?p in mir<! a few of the simple rules
ct the physical culturist. The most
irritant of these is a "don't." Don t
bend from thÂ« shoulders. Grasping your
rake f.rmly in bÂ«>th hands and holding
the body perfectly erect, swing out
Â¦Mth a broad, free stroke and draw tho
dried grass of the freshiy mown lawn
toward you ts you would draw back
an car when rowing. If you must ber.d,
b*?rd slightly from the waist with each
movement, raking first to one side and
then the other. This rotary motion
v ill give you the best possible exercise
for the muscles of the torso and is
an excellent cure for chronic indiges
tion. With each movement draw in a
long, deep breath, exhaling slowly and
deliberately afterward.' Raking and
hocir.g, if properly done, are without
an <.<iual as exercises for the muscled
of the- forearm. They also have a ten
dency to develop the muscles across
the b.iÂ« k and to give a breadth of
thoulder a hkh can Ze acquired in no
other may. Dut to be beneficial they
must be carried on in the correct way.
cr, instead of learning to carry your
self like the military man. you will
fall into the unbecoming and unneces
sary stoop of the farmer.
The woman who has the temerity to
ir.ovv her own Ijwn has discovered the
exercise of all exercises for the biceps
and the legs. One little woman gets up
very early every morning and donning
her bcthing suit creeps down the stairs
and out on the terrace in front of
her summer cottage, drags the creak
ing javn mower from its accustomed
place and determinedly pushes it up
and down the green stretch, up and
down the terraces and across every
grass-grown s:>ot until her muscles feel
fine and vigorous, her face is glowing,
her gardener is offended and her neigh
bors are her mortal enemies. She has
discovered a wonderful chest exercise,
however, and considers that worth all
the wrath she may incur. Standing en
the tc:> of the terrace and grasping the
handle br one hand she lets the lawn
xr.ower slide down as far as she can
reach, then, taking a long breath and
itrz.'m:ag her aim?, she pulls it up to its
first jKisition. lets it drop again with
the other hand, and so on.
The exercise Involved In digging about
one's plants with trowel and spade Is
one of the finest for the development
of the muscles of the abdomen. To get
the full benefit of such exercises fall
firmly upon the knees, being: careful
not to git back upon the feet and legs,
but to keep the body erect from the
knees u?. bending only at the waist,
when necessary, and holding the chest
erect. This centle but continued bend
ing of the waist from side to side, back
IT is the fad^ for every woman to
hce her own row in her garden.
The day when aU* fashionable fem
ininity sat in the gossiping corner
on the front piazza of a hot hotel and
regaled Itself with scandal and soda
is almost rasscd. Now every woman,
single cr rr.arrkd, seems to have hsr
own country retreat, be it only a log
cabin or a tent; and. with it. like foam
on the soda, goes always her gardenâ
r.ot the expensive, fancy garden of the
millionaire amateur, but a real. garden
thi.t yields peas and potatoes, as well
as roses, for the table ail summer lonp.
To have a garden, ir.e must have on.'
of two thir.jrâ either a gardener or
plenty of time, preferably the tatter.
If one is addicted to indigestion or u
sallow completion or a bid temper, or
the moi>es or even to laziness, a gar
den without a. gardener is the best
tonic In the v.orIU. No other sport or
amusement offers such wonderful op
portunities for developing muscles, for
clearing away liver tints, for brighten
ing eyes, for making waists slender
ard chests high and strong. The girl
who successfully raises a garden dur
ing one single summer gets more of
the right kin<J of physical training
than she could possibly acquire in
many winters' work under the ex
pensive tuition of a foreign fencing
master and a Boston health culturistâ
more than she couid ever get in the
best gymnasium built.
That is why so many women are now
"hoeing their own row," and it is
quite the smart and proper thing to
be caught, rake or trowel in hand and
sun-bonnet on head, in the midst of
jour garden patch, at the rear of your
colonial, summer mansion.
Gardening -is the feminine sport of
the hour. It is a physical training par
est principles set forth In the Swedish
method of exercising, so popular in
most gymnasiums. In addition to ab
dcminal exercises tfie digging process
involves a wrist exercise that is of no
mean value, and finger exercises that
no system of culture seems to include.
It gets the worker nearer Mother
Karth. too. and therefrom she breathes
health and life.
Using the garden hose is another
duty which r.iay be made a profit as
well as a pleasure. The young woman
who is Sn the habit of "walking all
over her own feet." as the Email boy
cxpres-std it. may, in this way, soon
come naturally by the proper method
of standing. Cra?iÂ» the hose firmly
ard. poised wc'.l on the bull of* the
foot, draw the body ciect. If rou do
nut k::u\v liow to take the proper po
sition of ih:?t c:!il shoulders, a good
mental suggestion is to remember that
a book or basket is resting on top of
your head. He very careful not to al
low ih!s iinciginaiy book or basket to
fall and you will very shortly find
yourself walking about in a stately
manner with the abdomen in, the
chest high, th-i head Gracefully poised
and the toes properly tilted down
ward.
One of the latest fads of the smart
woman who has her country or subur
ban lawn and garden is that of going
barefooted in the clew. This source
of health was discovered by Dr.
Kneipp and is called the Kneipp cure.
To rise 'at four o'clock, don her "gar
den frock ar.d sunbonnet and spend
an hour parading up and down in the
wet grass, raking or mowing, or sim
ply running about, means years added
to any young woman's life and a tint
that would cost s^xty cents per box
added to her complexion. One may
take the Kneipp cure while one mows
one's lawn or hoes one's potatoes,
thereby adding to health, beauty, ap
petite and garden truck at one time.
THE SAN F!'A>:aSCO SUNDAY CALE.
GARDENING FOR BEAUTY'S SAKE.
11The Duchess of Roxburghe wore a
pretty gown the other day, its color
being black and Its trimmings white.
It was one of those magpie dresses
which are so liked abroad. It was a
Paris gown, with, plenty of Parisian
chic. The skirt was full and round and
untrimmed, save by a wide band of
handsome lace applique .upon the foot,
but this trimming, though plain and
almost classic in its severity, was all
sufficient.
. " The waist was a round waist, some
what on the shirt waist'order, flmmed
with three ruffles, which exteu Jed all
around it and around the upper part of
the sleeves also. Around the neck,
Â¦which waa semi-lowâ cue of those
round Dutch necksâ there was laid a
beautiful collar ofwhlte lace embroid
ered with black silk threads, d rawn to
Imitate a beautiful daisy chain.
The Duchess of Marlborough wore on
the same occasion a lovely little gown
of old-fashioned white btrbblnet trim
med with lace ruffles, with abundant
hand embroidery running around the
skirt' above the ruffles. The embroidery
was very deep and was of the most ex
quisite order. The gown was worn over
a petticoat of beautiful lace.
In the fashion world there are con
tinually appearing new things or old
styles . worked up in new ways, and
among those there are many that catch
the eye at once by their beauty.

toward the back,. being slightly wider
at the middle of the back breadth.
And again one notices that skirts aro
trimmed with flounces that are straight
all the way around. They never grow
wider, nor do they narrow. They are
the little straight ruffles that were once
so much worn and which are revived
again in all their delicacy and pretti
ness. They are hemmed on the lower
edge and frilled on the upper.
Â¦ A Gown for Fall.
One lovely casino gown for fall is
made of figured silk. The background
is black and the figures, which are tiny
floral sprays, are in white and in raised
black. Around the bottom of the skirt
there are three ruffles of black taffeta.
TLese, instead of being strictly of the
ruffled type, are accordion plaited and
are set quite a little distance apart.
They are immensely effective upon this
background of black. And one of their
beauties is that they are very simple to
make.
And, to continue the skirt subject,
there can be mentioned, a very, full
skirt, which for actual beauty and gen
eral utility combined could not be
beaten. Its material was berege and
its color a seal brown. Half a dozen
rope shlrrings confined the hips. Then
the skirt hung very full. And around
the foot it was trimmed with three wide
bands of point de Flanders lace.
The fad for trimming cloth skirts
with lace, which started out as a tem
porary one, is becoming/permanent,
and the cloth gowns of fall will be lace
trimmed and lace ruffled. v â¢
A woman who goes to restaurant
dinners and who has many handsome
dinner gowns for such occasions is
wearing a gown that is made. of that
old-fashioned but ever beautiful ma-
terial, cashmere. It Is put together as
a shirt waist suit in three parts. There
is the waist, the skirt and the open
fronted coat.
But the novel part of thr-gown is the
skirt, which is very and is
trimmed around the foot- with three
bands of heavy lace. The lace 1b of the
sort that is put together with braid,
and is embroidered with fine stltchery
in the web. The making of this lace is
a pretty summer art. : SjSSi
Exquisite are- the collars which are
worn for restaurant dinners t and for all
occasions not strictly, full dress. And
not only, exquisite as to handiwork are
these, but very becoming to the wearer.
The lace collar, the lace stole, the wide
lace ruffle, which' is .laid around the
throat, and the deep lace frill," which is
thrown arcr jnd the shoulders, are all
an important part of the wardrobe.
Black taffeta dresses, with a large
hand-embroidered dot Wtjil raised from
the surface, are the neatest gowns th it
can be found, and what is more in their
favor, they are fashionable for all oc
casions. They can be worn for dinners
or, for luncheons or they can be made
up for evening.
The most fashionable gown of the
season is a black taffeta, with a large
black raised silk dot. The collar is
made of velvet, as are the cuffs, and
there* are pipings of turquoise blue satin
to finish both.
Pipings are more than ever the style,
and to pipe a gown with blue and
white Is a pretty sure jtvay to secure,

coming in, and, where there was one
dotted gown before* there will now be
a dozen. The dot. to be fashionable,
must look as though done by hand, for
it Is the embroidered dot"whlch makes
the gown chic.
Though it is summer time, Dame
Fashion is by no means asleep. She
is busy designing her fall wardrobe
and getting together gowns that will
do for wear in Septemoer and Octo
ber. The backbone of the summer is
broken. But fall â¢- near and there
mu<*be gowns for the cool days.
O*Â«e of Dame Fashion's pretty freaks
is the rope shirring. This is Dy no
tnsans a novelty, but the Dame of
Fashion Is treating it in a noved way.
She is setting rope shirring around the
hips and is finishing the shirring with
the narrowest little frills. These frills
are really too narrow to be called ruf
fles. They are, as their name asserts,
Bimply frills. They are no more than
a quarter or half an inch wide and
they are made of lace or of narrow
ribbon. Sometimes the tiny frill is a
silk frill on the bias, single or dou
ble.
And Dame Fashion has another fan
cy. She sets rope shirring around the
Ekirt half waj down, just about at
# *hs knea line. And here she places
ruffes three inches wide. These ruf
fles are very full and are hemmed
upon the bottom edge. Sometimes they
are doubled and they are also edged
with lace. This makes a charming
trimming for the skirt, if one Is not too
stout to wear ruffles. But even the
Btout woman is contracting a taste for
them.
In these days when so much inter
est centers in the skirt and when the
styles in skirts change so rapidly. It is
nice to know that one can take the
necessary precaution ror. being in style
for at least one eeason to come. And
this can be done by trimming the skirt
in ype of two or three waysâ ruffles,
lace bands or box plaiting.
The very latest advices from Paris
state that the new fall dresses of cloth

with ruffles that graduate a little

THERE they lay, sidc c by side,
ready to be packed in a trunk.
Gowns to be worn all the year:
AnÂ£ there stood the trunk,
"Wilt to Ct^the. gowns, made to order,
just the right length and Just the right
width, with a place in the top for the
hats that matched tht gowns.
They were casino gowns, all of them!
And all were to be packed arid shipped
away to the mountains. The fashiona
ble woman who had order^I them was
waiting to wear them ar.<?. Â»he gowns
were already late in the delivery, for
they were for th<* middle season.
"It makes no difference how late they
are," said the modiste with a shrug.
"For thl/ are built to x)e worn all the
yeai around. They are just as pretty
in the wl&^er as in the summer . and
just exactly as suitable in the fall as
in the spring.
"That is the way with the new
gov/ns. They must be made to wear
all this season and all -aext Eeason. A
gown that is for summer only would
have a very poor run of popularity.
"The casino gown." continued this
authority, "is one that can be worn in
the afternoon upon the pier. It is suit
able for the board walk on afternoon
occasions. It can -be worn to garden
parties and to piazza teas aim' it makes
a fine gown for a drive in one's Victo
ria.
"Later this same gown, if carefully
cared for, is tb-Â» thing to wear calling.
And, with a few additions, it makes a
very acceptable reception '* gown. Its
usefulness is not limited to a single
season, for it is a gown that lasts over!
"To be more specific, so that you can
understand how perfectly this can be
done, you must hear about one of these
dresses. It is a gray canvas of the
shade of gray that never goes out of
style. It is almost a silver gray and
the Ekirt Is very full. It Is tucked
around the hips and around . the foot
there are three little tucks. The style
is one that will not go out this season.
"Now comes the pretty part of the
skirt. There is a yoke of Irish crochet
lace, heavy and dyed gray, the exact
shade of the gown. The yoke is ad
justable and is fastened^ around the
waist by a belt which is put onÂ«>fter
the ekirt is on.
A Gown for All Seasons.
"When the wearer bo desires, she can
leave off this hip yoke of lace, or can
Eubstitute one of black . lace, thus
transforming the gown without de
tracting anything from its 6tyle.
"Or Ehe can do still better. She can
apply a deep hip yoke of lace through
which ehe can thread ribbons, this
making one of those new hip yokes, all
threaded with narrow bands, of Â£Jack,
immensely pretty and stylise.
"The waist has a round blouse, shir
red across the yoke with heavy rope
Khlrrings and finished with a yoke of
Irish crochet trimmed with long motifs
of lace. La^e rosettes with turquoise
centers were arranged down the front.
"Don't forget, when you are planning
your casino gown, to nQke it adjust
able, that is to make it so it can be
tronsformed from one kind of a gown
to another. Let the trimmings be of
the sort that can be removed and other
ones substituted.
"If I were a woman of fashion." said
this modiste with much emphasis. "I
would insist that my gowns be all
made on the very pretty semi-dress

There is a new style of neck flnfaa
which is very much liked. It looks
very much like a collar, and. indeed,
it is such. But, Instead of being cut
square In sailor fashion, it Is cut In
two long deep points in front that
come down almost to the belt line.
These points are edged with Valen

Handsome Waists of White Lace.
Very handsome autumn waists are
made of liberty satin and these waists
are not necessarily expensive. They
may be In a deep shade of oyster white,
trimmed with pale white lace, and
finished with applications of lace of a
deep shade of ecru.
It is very fashionable to make lace
waists of half a dozen shades of white
lace and to use the lace aa one would
use flounces of silk, with one flounce

single tone.

Deep black silk cuffs with wide

THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL*.
THE CASINO GOWN IS NOW THE FAD
12.of the editorial sanctum or the counting room. Therefore he
looked about him for more worlds to conquer. In the course of
his wanderings he found a defunct and mdre or less malodorous
railroad in a back alley, where some- one had thrown it away the
night before. Napoleon took it home and "cared for it tenderly,
nursing it back to life and bathing it gently with further issues of
common stock and overdue mortgage bonds. The line of the road
was somewhat uncertain, but as far as can be discovered at this
late day it began in the fertile imagination of a promoter and
ended in the bankruptcy court. |'v.j.'.
Having brought his alleged railroad to a point where it could
go out without a nurse, the man proceeded on his way to farrie and
a prominent place among the subscribers to the Indian famine
fund. His next venture was in politics, that legitimate field of
activity for every man who has not been actually convicted, of
crime. The convictions usually appear as a finale rather than as
an overture. There was a nomination for Congress going around
the district knocking at all the back doors and begging for some
one to take it out of the cold. The embryo Napoleon was a man
of unusual courage, as may be seen from the fact that 1^ opened
the door at the first knock and dragged the nomination. in by the
nape of the neck. No waiting to be called into the game by. his
more or less loving friends for hinii. Of course he was elected. It
was not on the cards that he should fall down on a simple little
thing like a Congressional election after he had breathed new life
into a newspaper and brought a dying railroacCout of the sani
tarium.
Having become duly chosen as one of the nation's legislators
,the next thing was to make good. He was not enamored of the
old-fashioned idea that a legislator's sole duty is to legislate. He
had a newspaper wherein he could J^int out the mistakes of the
other fellows and the superlative excellence of his own acts, be
sides butting into the Congressional Record with leave to print
on every possible occasion. He had a railroad that entitled him
to rank as one of the promoters of the vetted interest of the
country, although a vest pocket pocket interest would have been
a better definition. Now it'was up to him to make himself manu
facturer of something that he could sell to the Government at a
profit not to exceed ioo per cent, except in unusual circumstances.
To this end he bought a controlling interest in a factory for the
manufacture of rubber heels and had a bill passed requiring the
brave defenders of the country to be shod with the Napoleon Jar
on .the Spine and Surplus Eliminators. That was the way he paid
for the factory, vl)'.
He had now reached a" point V?h ere he signed all his letters
with a rubber stamp andrarried a stenographer around with him
when he traveled. It wasn't really necessary, but all the men of
affairs he had ever read about did it and he wanted to be in the
swim. He was the director of not less than six different compa
nies and was in a position to give advice on all topics of general
interest, from the -international policy of the United States Gov
ernment to the care and cultivation of peanuts. The college com
mencement thatwas without an oration from the latter-day Na
poleon was a barren waste, and he had a string of honorary de
grees that wrapped around h\( name four times and lapped over
at least a foot. Surely he was now a man of affairs. At least he
didn't know anything in particular about any one thing, but he
could give an imitationjtf an 7 man who suspected a whole lot. If
that isn't what makes a man of affairs, then the dictionary needs
to be revised.
About this time the people who had the honor of furnishing
the paper on which his alleged newspaper was printed began to
be impertinently curious as to the exact time when they might ex
pect a small payment on account of last year's bills. The Napo
leon wouldn't be bothered with -such things and referred them to
his cashier. That gentleman responded with the vulgar witticism
that there was no cash here. Also the stockholders in his railroad
were making inquiries about the date of the arrival of the next
dividend. To make matterr worse a Congressional committee was
looking into the price of .rubber heels with a view to ascertaining
the exact length of time that the world at large might be relieved
of the presence of the gentleman who was selling the articles in
question. to the 7 Government. The whole financial structure that
he had erected with such expenditure of cerebral energy and calo
rified atmosphere went to smbash in a single night and the imita
tion Napoleon departed for South America on the next day's
seamer.
At this point we may properly return to the eggs mentioned
in the beginning for the purpose of remarking that instead of put
ting his eggs all over the place the man would have done better to
have deposited them all in one basket and then sat on the bas
ket. They might have hatched that way.
â Copyright, 1904, by Albert Britt.
THIS is a discourse on eggs. (The janitor will please expel the
gentleman who said "eggsactly." A serious meeting must
not be disturbed by frivolous remarks.) Having opened the
subject and stuck our typewriter under one corner of it to
keep it from closing prematurely before we return, we will pass
on to the subject-matter of our discourse. A text is only for the
purpose of allowing the congregation to get settled and find the
place in the hymn books. The relation of the sermon to {he text
wil^be shown later on in the game.
There was once upon a time a gentleman from the back
woods who aspired to be what is called by the newspapers a man
of affairs. He wasn't particular what ... the affairs were or to
whom they belonged. All that he walked to do was to butt into
everything in sight except the State's prison. He had a large con
tempt for those mediocre individuals who are content to have only
one iron in the fire at a time. He had read pipe dreams about the
men who manage several great businesses with one hand tied be
hind them and break golf scores and work in the garden between
times. So he said to himself, "Go to, I will get me out into the cir
cumambient atmosphere and get me busy with three or four stu
pendous undertakings that will push me into the next volu'me of
'Who's Who and Why/ and will guarantee me at least a column
interview on the pier ev|ry time I sail for Euro*~." 0 Q
The fact that he had ifever managed anything more important
than a mule team hitched to a breaking plow didn't bother him
to any great extent. Although he had never been a Napoleon of
finance he thought that he knew the combination. Besides, wasn't
he a more or less free-born American citizen, anc haven't all such
the right and the ability to do anything t anybody that conies
down the pike? With this pious end in view he packed his an
cestral carpet bag and hit the trail. Ha was going to be out for
his own right from the getaway, and the more he could own the
better. The very first crack out of the box he bought a half in
terest in a broken-down newspaper that was lying around waiting
for some one to put it out of its misery. He didn't have any
capital, but the man who had been paying the bills before the in
cipient Napoleon hove in sight was too glad to get his white ele
phant off his hands to worry any one about paying him for the
privilege of performing the operation. The only trimg that the
former owner wanted to do was to sidestep the monthly bills.
After acquiring an infinitesimal portion of the great molder of
public opinion the nyin who would butt in issued to himself a few
hundred thousand dollars of first preferred and made up a num
ber of bales of common as a premium to subscribers. Printing is
cheap, and he was determined that at least a million homes should
have a framed stock certificate hanging in the parlor.
Being, as we have indicated, a Napoleon of finance and not a
mere newspaper editor, the man was not content to sit down and
watch the subscriptions roll in. Not for him the orderly quiet

STYLES. FOR STOUT WOMEN
(Mrs. Henry M.). â It is difficult to
cover this ' subject in a limited space
because of the many things which may
be done by the stout woman to keep
her dress up to date and yet greatly
disguise her increasing bulk. You can
be strictly in style and yet not copy
literally the fashions of the seasons if
you will but adapt the mode to your
requirements. Careful- changes here
and there will- eliminate objectionable
features or, make the more becoming.
In short, use only the salient lines as
a Â¦, basis to work on. .'Bulk about the

TO SWEETEN THE BREATH (Ger

is tainted lose no time in correcting the
evil. Offensive breath pollutes the very
air. you breathe and becomes a source
of misery to those with whom you are
brought into close contact! Do not re
sort to highly perfumed lozenges, but
discover the source of the trouble and
treat It properly.- It may come' from a
disordered stomach, catarrh of the
throat and bronchial tubes, nasal pass
ages or from the teeth. The latter
cause is easily remedied by regular vis

care of the teeth, the thorough brush

even for a day. Ask your physician to

a skirt: all cross lines and especially
those about the waist have a broaden
ing effect and the stout figure must be
given height by long lines which run
unbroken from ; the shoulder to the
waist line. * To obviate severity- break
the lines with some transparent trim
ming such as. lace. Belts or girdles
should be very narrow and are -most
becoming, when pointed downward at
the back and front and should be in
black to match the costume. Avoid
sleeves which are too fancy; many
lines at different angles increase the
apparent size of .a large arm. The
newest collarless corset jacket or the
semi-fitted coat adjusted by center
back and under arm seams, only with
shawl collar facing and bishop
sleeves, are practical for traveling, and

doubtless responsible for present con
ditions. The padding has . overheated
and compressed the muscles so long
that their expansion has been retarded.
The corset and all undergarments must
fit well, but should be loose enough to
permit perfect freedom. With summer
so near it is an easy' matter to make
the new waists loose and full across
the bust in soft frills, bertha effects,
etc., which will disguise the lack of
form until the figure has improved., Be
particular to keep the diet simple and
nourishing and exercise freely in the
open air. Practice the following move
ments before retiring and again in the
morning after five minutes spent In
deep breathing: Grasp a light dumb
bell in both hands and slowly raise the
hands upward until they come together
over the head; then slowly lower to the
sides. Next bring the hands to center
front of chest and thrust the arms
straight out from the shoulder, not too
forcibly, and bring them back again.
This will strengthen the muscle3
around the armpits and central part of
the chest. To feed the shrunken tissues
apply a pure skin food and rub it in
well before retiring, using the finger
tips only and with gentle pressure.
SUGGESTIONS FOR A DH3T
(Maud).â In fitting up a den all the col

collecting a meaningless lot of trifling
objects the distinctive qualities of
which are based upon freaklshness of
form. Decide upon a style of furnish

ELSIE (Beltsy-Belt, buckles of \ all
descriptions are being worn and you
can g^t them for any price, but I
should advise you to send for a leather
belt to match your gown. They range
from twenty-five cents to a dollar. and
a quarter. The cheaper ones really are

COUNTRY GIRL (Embroidery).â
Certainly you can send to any shop in

careful not to get flowers, like roses,
that require a great deal of shading, Â¦
for they are difficult to do nicely and
require experience. Violets are always
pretty, and you can work them in
white and so get used to the linen and
hoops. State the price you want to
pay and you will get In return some
pretty design. There are frequent sales
at the emporiums and at such times
you can get a fairly good square for
fifty cents. I believe the Bilk comes

twenty-five cents.

Idea I have seen lately for tally cards
is flowered wallpaper. Buy It by the

player. Deep red roses shading to pink
are especially fetching. This way of
making them is very inexpensive, and
as they servo beautifully for place

â¢ HOW TO FIT A SLEE VE (Begin
ner).â-The secret of a perfect fitting
sleeve depends largely upon how it is
set In the armhole. If this part of the
work is. faulty the sleeve .will never
set correctly no matter how well it is
made. Try on the fitted waist and see
if the armhole is large enough. Do
not tamper with it unless absolutely
necessary, for a miss cut here will ruin
the waist. If it feels too snug cut
away one-half inch underneath and
graduate upward in front to a mere
thread at the shoulder seam; never
cut out at the back. Slip the finished
Bleeve on the arm and pin the inside
seam of sleeve about two inches for
ward of: the underarm seam of . the
waist, or as indicated by a notch or
; perforation in the pattern used. Baste
the sleeve In-carefully, gathering the
fullness in the top of the sleeve and
placing center top edge of sleeve, usu
ally indicated by a notch in the pat
tern, to: the shoulder seam. > Try tjie

the sleeve "must be raised forward and
upward ."toward : the: shoulder, .seam
one-half ,inch or more, which will
smooth out the wrinkles. -Should the

the arm and the top of the sleeve push
outward at the back, the seam is placed
too- high- ins the armhole and "must be

with sharp irregular pains extending
over the back of the nee!-, above the
ears and also around the eyeballs, with
more or less throbbing pain through
the temples and forehead, you may be

The symptoms mentioned are usually
more noticeable after an evening at thu
theater or similar place, when an effort
Is made to concentrate the sight on a

Wore often thitn not she possesses
limited possibilities. For instance, a
enio.ll porch on the surrix aide of the
house does not look especially alluring,
but trust her to be equal fca just such
emergencies. She eyes her points of
vantage as a general eyes his field ana
P?ecJ womanlike, sits down to ponder.

Is to see tuat vines ara plcnted that

liito l. fairy bower. &
i Jio.i she turns her attention to thÂ«s
con-ring. If she fancies purple, aÂ»d
lir.ov.s that it will mcka a pretty, be
comi::a background for her, she selects
me liiritty cleiiia/.is jackmanii with its
purple peta!ed blossoms and it3 ri'jh
leaves. Virginia creepers, wis
taiLus, trnmpct crcspers, old fashioned
morning giorirv;, sweet honey suckles
r.nd even climbing roses arc all prime
favorites, but are not always possible,
because of lack of forethought. Noth
ing could be more attractive than a
bower of crimson rambler roses that
presents a vivid mass of coloring, but
unfortunately they will not spring uj>
in a day, or even two, and she is forced
tÂ«Â» nurse a quick growing vine that re
quires but a few short weeks to be in
ail its glory.
When the green manifests its Inten
tions of climbing up in a hurry she
arms herself with aome wire netting;
shears and a hammer and sets to work.
In un end she cuts out a. diamond
tihape-d window and later trains her
vines about it, for this is one of her
jwjnts of vantage. She is secluded from
the public gaze, but at the same time

not she. That might have been all very
well and good at one lime, but that
time has long since passed and even
thÂ« memory of It in dim and hazy. f.
Just as soon as the vines are able to
take care of themselves she devotes
herself to hanging baskets that may be
suspended about here and. there. And
here her ingenuity comes to the front
again, for she uses what comes to her

Much of this porch girl's furnishings
depends upon the state of her pocket
book, but If she is handy with: a paint
brush she can. make any old piece of
discarded furniture look' plenty good
enough for her house of roses. . ,
A small table with a shelf is a valu
able ally, for " the newest magazines
and books may be within ea^V reach
of theChammock.^and the idler wants
nothing better than a cozy couch, an
interesting book and â quiet. A chafing

which do duty -.not qnly as ornaments
but in preparing dainties tbtt insure
miladi's popularity, stand on top of the
table, so that they are ready at a
moment's notice when the unexpected
caller arrives.
This philosophical lassie appreciates
the value of silence, and when the
masculine mind is busy digesting a
short story she affect3 the homely do
mestic graces, knowing full well that
he is watching her out of the corner of
his eye as' she brews and prepares
a cup of tea. She cuts the lemon
to serve the tea a la Rues, places a
f?v. cakes in a dainty dish, sees tT^tt
the fruit is temptingly arranged with
its own leaves as decorations and then
sits down, folds her hands and calmly
awaits the lord of creation's pleasure.
She's a bit diplomatic in her own
way and thoroughly enjoys 3 playing
with her victim.
When milord is quite ready for his
tea, ehe attends to him in quite a
motherly fashion, for when she began
to plÂ£*i her campaign it dawned upon
her that it would not be a bad scheme
to give the impression that she was a
good housewife. Apron strings are not
such bad things to be tied to when their
owner is a good cook. --â¢â¢ .;
Then again this porch girl knows the
charms of music, and when things are
getting stupid she saves the day by
accompanying snatches of songs on
the guitar or banjo or by twanging out
darky melodies until the spirit of the
cakewalk permeates the air.
The wise lassie does not reserve all
her smiles and blandishments for the
swalnw that- loiter at this trysting
place, for she knows that "daddy" will
be certain to seek her in her cool re
treat and that her big brothers will
drop in on her and, what is more to the
point, bring their chums to have a cup
of "Sis' " tea.- So, like the sensible girl
that she is, she dons her prettiest frock
and her most fetching manner and sets
out to captivate every one in sight â
her own family included. And once
within her fairy retreat, which is like
the lanai of her Hawaiian sisters, all
are lost to her mystic power, and she
rules as absolutely as any queen that

pay for a few luxuries now and then?"
Queerly enough the eyes that looked
Into his as in fancy he made this
speech- "were of- a clear, lucid gray,
with long, dark lashes and beautifully
pencil{-d brows. To be candid, they
were the eyes of Elinor Grant, one of
the few girls of his acquaintance
whose society he had ever found as
entertaining as business. It seemed
a sort of miracle that they should
appear at this particular juncture. De
cidely. Fate was' giving "him a tip.
Wiien lie called that afternoon Mis3
Grant- was out and he had a. childish
feeling 4hat the bottom had -dropped
out of things. A dark suspicion ' that
other men besides himself might have
received tips from Fate also haunted
him and the thought made him a trifle
uneasy.
He wandered back down town, feel-
Ing -rather glum. There were other
girls, of course, always. But he wanted
to see her and no one else. Some way,
of all the girls he knew she was the
only one ho could ' think of In con
nection* with the household details
that had suddenly appealed to him
with their homely charm. In imagina
tion he. could see her bustling about
her little domain, one of those narrow,
brownstone houses huddled * timidly
between more pretentious ones on some
side stre?t.- directing her .maids and'
taking a lively interest In the affairs
of her little household.,
Â¦ The fancy j pleased him immensely,
and he: was going on to elaborate it
when the' gay colors of a display of
wall paper In a window he was pass
ing caught- his eye. He slackened his
pace and then and not until then did
he observe the figure of a trim young
woman standing before it, absorbed In
contemplation. In a moment, he was
by her side.
"One would think you had an es
tablishment . of your, own and were
. It: was -a homely moment for self
reyelation, .but it so happened and so
it must be set down. An Instant later
lie was thinking- that It wouldn't be
half bad to be one of those married

celvlng .such injunctions ast "Now,
John, don't forget to telephone . the

During the rest of his toilette Mow
bray grinned- at himself in .the glass,
more or less humorously. "Up to /the

money making, with occasional gay
hours, had seemed to him as satisfy

though perhaps the rhythmic

his mind for the idea.
The world, so far as he could see it
from the windows of his back room,
had grown suddenly domestic. Every
time he approached the 'window some

vague, injured sense of being out of it
Then one morning there was a deaf
ening, clatter outside the window,
where on an adjacent wall the Ivy
leaves were already changing from
russet to rich green and the plumes
of the wistaria vine waved with lan
guid elegance In tfTe spring breeze.
True to their nature, the sparrows
were wrangling fiercely.
getting ideas for having It done over,"
was his laughing salutation, as he
looked down. at her with a. pleased
warmth in his eyes and enjoyed the
startled glance she turned upon him.
It seemed the sweetest thing that he
should have come upon her like this:
as If some subtle influence had turned
her thoughts into the same channel
with his own. Decidedly, things were
coming his way. He felt exhilarated,
triumphant, boyish. Miss Grant
laughed rather foolishly as she greeted
him.
"I was playing a game that has been
a favorite of mine since I was a small
girl," she explained, as they turned
away >from. the window together, "a
game of 'make-believe,* in which I ar
range everything in life to suit myself.
Nettle and Iâ Nettie â¢ was my best
friend, you knowâ used to spend hours
describing our husbands, houses and
children to each other. It was great
fun, I can tell you, and we entered into
details until it actually. seemed real."
She paused and glanced up at him
to see if he understood, and then con
tinued: "When you came up I was
just furnishing a love of a house in
thought, selecting the color scheme
for my wails, you know!"
Mowbray listened, almost too rapt
to speak. There was something thrill
ing In the knowledge that her thoughts
had been the very complement of his.
A strange, strong happiness and cer
tainty possessed him.
"Would you mind telling me whether
the husband that you had planned bore
any resemblance to me?" he ques
tioned, daringly.
. She. regarded him critically. Then
shook "her head. "Don't think me
rude," she murmured, "but to tell you
the truth,. ha was always r.'-i feet tall
and blond. O~ Â¦Â» I remember when
we had reached the end of a game,
that Is, seen our daughters grow up
and marry, we began all over again,
and, for a change, I chose a dark, cold
man who filled me with a delicious
fear. -But I was always forre&Ioj* *ad
harking back to my favorite- type, so
at last I gavÂ© up."
"Too bad, too bad," murmured her
companion, but his tone Implied that
his pity waa for her disappointment
rather than his own. They ; walked
along In silence for awhile, absorbed
in their thoughts and the lively scene
about them, yet strangely conscious
of each other. â¢ At last ilowbray
spoke.
"I- don't see how tha thing Is coming
out," he began with feigned bewilder
ment. "For when the sights and sounds
of early spring suddenly made me
homesick for the thing I've never hadâ
a homeâ "
His voice grew low and he paused a
second as If the thoughts were too sa
cred to be mentioned lightly. Elinor's
heart went out to him. though she stub
bornly kept her glance fixed indiffer
ently on the crowd about them.
â¢ "It was your face that rose before me
instantly, your eyes "that looked into
mine, your dear presence that I felt fa
the house that I planned, like a bene
diction, a caress. You were the spirit c
the place. Its queen, the gracious wom
an to whom I fancied myself coming
home each night with a deeper, fuller
love."
â¢ A hsedless pedestrian Jostled them, all
unconscious . of the fact, that in doing
so he had rudely brushed against the
sweetest thing in the world â a love
story. They continued their way, al
most In si'ence, until the bewildering
greenery of the park turned by spring
magic Into -fairyland confronted them.
In a tlash Eleanor seemed to see her
life stretching away . into the future,
transformed into a beauty as matchless
as that before her. by love. ]
She laid her hand. upon Mowbray'a
arm and gazed at him for a moment
with her soul in her eyes.
"After all." she said very softly, "I
believe that you 'dreamed true!*"

It is no condescension to talk to Alex

Dent bowed again profoundly, so pro
foundly that when he stood erect - he
had gained control of the smile that
threatened to convulse his countenance,
for he knew he could not be mistaken
about that patch and diamond dust. It
was scarcely probable that two girls
would be dressed just like this.
When she sav.- him .coming toward
her with the evident intention cf speak

mischief.
"May I Introduce myself?" he asked,
bowing before her.
Bettina raised a haughty little head.
"It is somewhat unusual for royalty to
be approached with so little formality,"
she said icily, "but, .of course, the
daughter of the lost Dauphin of France
has had to put up with a great many

Dent looked startled. "Perhaps I have

dances that she fairly reveled, in? and
she Jiad not been known to miss one
since her. brother had been in charge.
She would take the electric car from
the* city and, arrive at the sanitarium
triumphantly bearing a box containing
her newest party dress, produced by
homeo talent. The girl's mother en
couraged her 'Industry by giving her
all the material for party dresses that
she would rriake up, and her chic crea
tions were the envy of her girl friends.
. When she had arrived that after
noon she had shown her brother a gay
little blue and pink pompadour frock
that he had vowed would make it
necessary â¢ to send all his harmless
patients back to padded cells and leave
a paucity of dancing men.
Dr. Dent's train was late. He hur
ried into his dres's suit and the twa
friends started down the hall . toward
the ballroom. An attendant came up
hurriedly and whispered" that Hilyer
was needed immediately.
"I'm sorry, old man," he said, turn
ing to go with the nurse". "You'll have
to find your way in alone. There's
no hostess, so go in and talk to ( any

will have no trouble in recognizing
her."
Bettina was partly hlflden by a
group of palms when Dent entered
the room. She saw him speak to sev
eral of the patients near the door, and
â¢finally ask one dark-eyeC girl to
dance.

from the photograph in her brother's
room, and studied him calmly as he and
. his partner passed her. : ;â¢ <
Certain, she was* that Will had not

. and that even the photograph had been
misleading. She acknowledged to her
self the Improbability of a man of his

Will .might have mentioned his style of
dancing as a point in his favor when he
had given a list of his friend's many

Bettlna gave her head a disdainful
toss and helped herself to another
chocolate.
"I know I shan't even like him," she
said, finding it difficult to express dis
approval with any great amount off dig
nity, when one cheek was distorted by
a chocolate drop.
"Now, Bettlna, that's simply preju
dice. He was the nicest fellow at col
lege, and he is the or.ly man on earth
I would be willing for you to marry."
Bettina's fingers seized a candle 1 vio
let which she discovered in the corner
of the box.
"Of course I know he's a wonder,"
she said, "that's the reason I know I
Eban't like him. He is probably so
perfect that he chews his food a regu

Hilyer laughed.
"I've seen him swallow sandwiches

Bettina, please be reasonable! I

Bettina balanced the somewhat de

ornamented the doctor's desk.

afternoon and ask that the fleur-de
lis shall be bound always **by the royal
ribbons of his house."
Later that afternoon Bettlna smiled
into his eyes admiringly.
"I certainly am glad to marry a.
man who knows so much," she said,-
pointing to the painted .ribbon; that
she wore In a knot on her breast, "now
I was so Ignorant that I. had no Idea
how Alexander's coat of arms looked."
Dent drew the curly head over on
his shoulder and laughed.
She asked him why he laughed.
He didn't think It necessary to tell
her that he had paid a girl In In art
store to copy the strangest looking
shield he could find in the dictionary.
A lion couchant or a charger rampant
were all the same .to him â he had
trusted to luck that she would not
know the difference, and ha now added
a touch of diplomacy that promised
him great future success ma a married
man.
"What am I laughing at. little girl?
You might know that a nian who was
emotional enough to cry for mere
worlds would laugh "when ha foundâ â¢
heaven." â¢
(Copyright, 1904, by Troy AOl^n.) i
"We always said." he commented,
"that your Inother's* people must be
of the right sort I'm glad of jL Work
with the tents Isn't for such as" you."
Then he turned, but more than the
make-up came off oi\ the towe'l as he
Nellie raised a hand. "Don't, Jim,"
Bias said plaintively. "He hasn't said
.anything to me. It's just that they
want to take me away.**
"Take you away'." he cried incredu
lously. "Why you've been with the
eld show ever since you were a little
kiddie; ever since your ma died of yel
low fever in the Rio and we picked >ou
@- the nest season. Th?* was 'way
back In '02, ar.d you were a little shrimp
of twelve. Take you away! I'd like
to see the man who'd try it!"
. "It's the money," she explained,
despairingly. "I'm an h.TJess. and this
gentleman is the lawyer. He wants
rÂ£E to go back to New York with him
to-night." â¢
For a single moment Blakelv's
fretee grew rigid- The lawyer, a keen
observer of men, followed clearly the
mental strain the circus man was un
dergoing. He could see what the clrl
tad never seen, that this man with the
uncouth mask of zinc and carmine
loved the little rider, and In the brief
struggle he read tt* fight of an honest
man with his own desires.- Jn that
short space Blakely made his fieht-
Whe?i he gpeke his voice was cold and
commonplace.
"See here," he said fiercely, "this
Isn't any place for an outsider, least
of all for a blbotola' dude what comes
in end Insults one of our girls. If you
don't get out of here quick you'll be
feorry for It, and I won't have to call
any 'Hey Rul>e* to do it."
Spar.gles, *?:<? Great Dane, that did
a pad-riding act as well as leading a
troupe of trained dojrs, pricked up her
ears knowingly and rose to her feet.
"Hey Rube!** the circus war cry from
time Immemorial, was no new som.d
to her, and f-he looked affectionately
at tue left lrg of the stranger's care
fujly creased trousers, deciding that
a spot about four inches below the
knee would be the strategic point for
a grip.
Circus folk are always resentful of
the intrusion of. the outside world into
their domain, and the fact that this
stranger wore u frock coat and an ex
ceedingly shiny silk hat grai all that
was needed \& convince Jim that he
wes the cause of Nellie's tearful eyes.
He strode up u-rathfully, his painted
1-ce in^ ludicrous contrast to the in
tense tines of his voice.
y-T IM BLAKELY. the flown, came
I datidr.s cut of the ring Into lha
1 dressing-tent and stopped short.
\m* ' Nellie Cosgrove was sitting on top
of the leaping pad. her usually merry
eyfs with tears. Beside her
stood a man looking exceedingly, awk
ward and uncomfortable. - f^*
(Copyright, 1904, by T. C. McClure.)
He had loved and . watched; over
Nellie ever since that ' time in Rio
Janeiro, when, " 'way back in '92."
they had picked up the little slip of a
girl, the sole survivor of a circus
troupe which had played
South America the season before.
He had known Frank Cosgrove well,
a fine, gentlemanly fellow, who had
run off with an English girl wh'eft her
parents had objected to her marrying
the "riding master" of an English
caravan.
They had come to -America to es
cape memories.: and she- had taken up
with circus life- as. willingly as though
she had not been reared in luxury. It
was Blakely who had persuaded Del
more to take the girl Into the troupe,
and It was he who had completed her
education as a rider. Before a broken
leg compelled him to take to clown
ing he had been a wonderful bare
back somersaulter himself.
He had hoped some day to make
her his wife when the nest egg In a
city savings bank had grown large
enough to warrant the purchase of a
country place and assure a compe
tence when they should have retired.
Until then he had spoken no word
of love, but rather had encouraged her
to look upon him as her foster-father.
Now he wa3 to lose her and all that
he had planned and worked and saved
for. But it was best for herâ that was
enough for him.
He took no part In the rlns-bank
chat after supper. He had no heart to
sit there about the bank and .hear the
comment that would be made about the
good fortune of the girl, so he. went out
back of the dressing tent, and liKhtinsr
the short stub of a pipe he carried, blew
great clouds of smoke into the soft
evening air, as he tried to think what
the circus would be on the morrow with
no little Nell to make every one merry.
There in the soft light that came
through the tent she found him. Out
front all was life and movement. Here
they were practically alone. She
slipped down beside him on the over
turned manger and clipped her hand
into his. His horny palm closed over
her tiny fingers and he put away the
pipe, but he gave no other sign. It was
she who opened the conversation.
'â¢I feel like a dream girl to-night,".
*. ,â¢ * â¢ â¢ Â¦ â¢
The "round-top" wa3 already
packed in the wagons and its way to
the cars when Nellie emerged from
the women's side of tha dressing te^t.
where the lawyer waited impatiently
for his charge. She went up to tha
bos3 -property man. "Put mytrunSt in
the wagon. Sam," she said; "I'm-go
ing on with the show."
The lawyer blustered and stormed,
but she. was adamant' and finally ha
appealed to Blakely.
"Tou can't go with, us, Nell," said
the clown, his face as white as though
he had not removed h!3 rinc mak&'-up.
"There is no reason why you should
stay on." .
She made him a saucy cour!Sa3y.
"There Is every reason, good sir," she
smiled. "In the first place, this tÂ» my
life; the only one that I know or wjnt.
and besides â " she went very close
and whispered In hlaear â "besides, I
found out back of the tent there that
â I â loved you." .
And after that what could Blftkely
say?
She turned up the turf with the toe
of a dainty shoe. "I don'J. want &
makeup my mind to it," she* protested.
"I don't care for the old money. I want
to be here with you and all the rest.
Tou hurt me!" she broke off suddenly,
releasing her hand from his grasp and
rubbing it- Â¦ â¢
."I didn't mean to hurt you, child/*
he said sadly. "I was thinking." He
could not tell her how that one sen
tence had torn at hl3 heartstrings, j*l
ready sore. He rose. "Well, I've got
to go In and gst Spangles rea,dy. I'll
pay good-by after the show." He
turned on his heel and presently she
could hear him calling to the" \iog.
Then other sounds of preparation, be
gan and presently she, too, went In
side. . Y;*- *
you've got the money, you've got to go
and live up to it. It would never do
for an heiress to rids in the ring."
"I don't want to go a bit," she pror
tested. "This la the life I Xnow and
love. I want to stay here and be my
self, not 'another girl all dressed up*,
with servants and all that sort of
- f fifÂ» here. Nell," he commanded,
"don't talk. like that. It's hard work
doing two acts twice a day. It's not
for you, my gi,rL Make up your mind
to th"at."
she began confidingly. "Don't you re
member how we used to plan that # if
Â¦wo ever got money we would start a
show of bur own, and only have In the
companyrpeople we really liked, and
make them -do' onLV one act apiece?"
He .laughed shortly. Â£â¢};â¢

(Stec List of Prizes.)LONDON, July 30. â Burglars are
the bane of existence . of- the j young
Duchess of Itoxburghe, who was Miss
May Goelet of New York! The stories
printed of the fabulous jewels pos
sessed by the beautiful American
Duchess have apparently drawn the<
attention of the knights of the. Jimmy
and at least three attempts have Deen
made to annex her Grace's jewel case.
The Duchess is thoroughly alarmed
and has not only placed her jewels in
safe deposit vaults, but has surrounded
herself with all sorts of burglar alarm
appliances.
Until recently she was employed as a
telegrapher in the central postofflce
and lived alone in a boarding-house,
her widowed mother being governess
with a family traveling abroad.
PARIS. July 30.â A new poetess was

the ages of 7 and 26 are received into
the school for the purposes of educa
tional and industrial training, after
which .situations are obtained for
them according to their capacities.
Lady Craven has paid frequent visits
to the schools lately and has been
much interested in the deftness shown
by pupils, particularly those whom she
saw manipulating the tyepwrlter with
a speed equal to that of persons enjoy
ing the blessing of their sight.'She went
through all the workshops and saw
men making mats and girls knitting
stockings by machinery. So struck was
she with the general excellence of the
work turned out that she left an order
in the salesroom for a number of mats
and stockings. She listened to a pupil
playing the organ, and she promised (6

commercial and social life of Ireland
are now for the first time found co
operating In behalf of the league. How
rapid has been its growth may be in
ferred from the fact that whereas a
few years ago it numbered 200 branches
in Ireland it now has close on 1000.
Patrick O'Daly, the general secretary,
who has rare talent for organization,
is kept continually busy forming new
branches.
While the league holds itself rigidly
aloof from politics, its existence proved
almost fatal to the Government during
the present session of Parliament. At
the behest of the league Irish members
divided the House of Commons on the
question of educational expenditure in
Ireland, particularly with reference to
the need of affording greater facilities
for l teaching. Irish in "the national
schools, and the Government, not being
prepared for the division, was defeated
by a small majority. A viceregal com
mission was appointed to inquire into
the subject, and Douglas Hyde, who
appeared before it, made out such a
strong case for instruction in Gaelic
that at present it is being taught In 5000
schools throughout the country, and the
Government. has even appointed a spe
cial staff of inspectors whose sole duty
it will, be to watch the progress of the
men like Lord Iveagh, W. J. Plrrie,
Captain Shawe-Taylor, Edward Mar
tyn, Lord Ashbourne and others of
equal prominence in the professional,

TUNIS. July 30. â A magnificent
statute of Apollo of colossal size and
in perfect condition has been un
earthed In the excavation of the
theater recently discovered at Car

A magnificent cameo, bearing the
figure of Pallas wearing the helmet.
has also been found,
What the Gaelic League really aims
at is to accomplish by educational
means that which insurrections and
political agitations have so signally
failed to attainâ the nationalization of
Ireland. Its speakers appeal to historic
examples for proof that a nation's lan
guage is intimately associated with Its
NATIONALIZATION* DESIRED.
It Is no mere sentimental feeling, or
love of scholarship, which prompts the
efforts of the league which is so suc
cessfully making for) the revival and
cultivation of Ireland's ancient lan
guage. In no other way, it Is main
tained, can Ireland, as a distinctive
nationality, be preserved.
"Practically." says one writer, "the
whole history of our country during
the nineteenth century has been one of
slow but steady growth in Ireland of
English thought, manners, customs,
ideas and ideals. The Anglicizing of
Ireland proceeds apace and will pro
ceed unless she reverts once more to
the speech which preserved her from it
in the past, and has alone the power to
stem the tide which bids fair to swamp
her."

the value of the heritage which so
many of them so lightly prized. In
1831 irish was spoken in Ireland by
3,000,000 people. Their number, before
the formation of the Gaelic League,
had dwindled to 800,000.

LONDON, July 30.â Dorothy Lewis is
one of the prettiest and most petted
little girls in London. Her mother is
better known in both social and theat
rical circles as Miss Fanny Ward, once
a comic opera favorite in New York.
Every few years the old longing for
the stage used to draw Mrs. Lewis to
appear again in public as a star. Her
husband, "Joe" Lewis, who made a
great fortune in South African mining
stocks, shrugged his shoulders and
footed the bills.
But now little Dorothy is the favor

of building up an Irish Ireland that
will look within itself for its inspiration
and its reward. The aims of the league
being primarily the "preservation of
Irish as' the national language of Ire
land and Its, extension as a spoken
tongue," the popular feature of the
convention will be oral, literary and
vocal competitions in Gaelic. But its
more practical work will be represent
ed by an exhibit of Irish industries, for.
the members of the association are
pledged not only to do their utniost to
encourage native products, but to wear
only Irish-made clothing and to pur
chase only Irish goods when they will
supply the place of foreign articles.
What Is known as. the Gaelic revival
was started in a small room in lower
O'Conncll street, Dublin, barely eleven
years ago. The great success which

vote himself to the unification and up
building of Ireland, so long distracted
by party * dissensions and religious
strife. That he, a Protestant, should
be recognized as the leader and inspi
ration of the new movement is In it
self significant of the breadth of its

strength from the fact that its plat
form is non-denominational, and non
political. For more than 100 year,s Ire

A number of restaurants and other
simiUr establishments seek to increase
the number of their visitors by the
display of orchestras composed of at
tractive looking young ladies. The
lynx-eyed police have detected in sev

with dummy violins, who stand in the
background and scrape away in per

but without producing any sounds.
They are utterly ignorant of the in
strument, which the public believes
they are seriously playing.
The police regard this method of
strengthening orchestras with fasci

deceivers, as illegal, as coming within
the. provisions of the law for the sup

they are sending test cases to the
courts for decision.

One of the charities to which Lady

years a generous subscriber, to the

her honesty.
LADY CRAVEX'S CHARITY.
OONSUKLO AX EARLY RISER.
Earlv visitors to Covent Garden, es
pecially Jn the flower section of the
market, have been somewhat curious
lately as to the identity of a distin
guished looking woman who appeared
much absorbed in the different kinds
of flowers and plants that are depos
ited there in the early morning for
sale. She is always accompanied by
two other women, who apj^ar to be
her maids. A caterer of flowers to
royalty at last recognized her as the
Duchess of Marlborougii. She has
lately cultivated a taste for early ris
ing and it is not an uncommon thing
to flnd her among the flowers at 5 in
the morning. She invariably walks to
the market and carries her purchases
on top of an ordinary four wheeler on
the return Journey, she says she
Joves to see the West End thorough
fares when the West End sleeps and
declares that it is the only time dur
ing the day that she is actually free
from excitement. The majority of her
market purchases are destined for her
favorite hospitals.
Since she has become a familiar
figure in the market the flower por
ttrs. who are generally middle-aged
women, run after her, offering v their
services in language as polite as Co
vent Garden can muster, because they
hnve learned by experience that she
is exceedingly generous to her own
sex and that the "tip" will be a hand
some one. One of the maids discov
ered after a recent visit to the market
that the Duchess had given one of
these women a ten-shilling; piece In
A matter that is somewhat seriously
exercising the minds of her neigh
bors is that her Grace Is introducing
English men and women as servants.
In the days of the late occupier a few
were English, but the majority were
Irish. If it were not for the popu
larity which the Duchess has already
achieved by personal examples of
munificence and generosity the par
tiality she. displays for Sa-ssenach me
nials would be resented.
It is believed In the neighborhood of
the castle that to console her for her
disappointment over the King's visit,
the Duke and Duchess of Connaught,
v.ith Princess Victoria, will spend a
week or ten days at Kylemore imme
diately after the Duke and Duchess
take possession. The place abounds in
excellent sport in the way of shooting
and fishing, to which the royal party
is devoutly attached. The 'â¢house
warming" is expected to be conducted
on a lavish pcale. The young ! eir to
the Manchester title, who was born in
the other Irish home of the Duke and
Duchess, will for the first time invite
other distinguished babies to share his
hospitality, so that Kylemore will find
gathered under its roof a collection of
youthful aristocrats who may live long
? nouRh to make history. The peasant
children of the neighborhood will be
provided with a party, too. but it is
not known at present whether they will
be allowed to share in the frolics of the
aristocratic bairns. All ths promises
mad* to the people on the estate on
the occasion of the anticipated visit
of the King in April last will now bÂ»
red^med. They will have a holiday at
the Duchess* expense, a party at the
castle in the evening, at tyhich beer
and whisky and music will be provided
âin fact, they will be able to drink her
health in anything from ginger beer to
Burgundy. â¢
LONDON. July 30.â After much de
r'ay the extensive struc*^ral altera
tions which have been under way at
Kylemore Castle for some months are
now practically completed and it is ex
pected that the Duke and Duchess of
Manchester will be able to go into res
idence there before the end of the Lon
don season. AH the rubbish created by
the alterations, as well as the build
ing tackle, is being removed, but as the
nearest railway station is seven miles
distant from the castle it will be about
a week or two before the grounds and
the premises can be entirely rid of the
unsightly litter. The Duchess, who is
much annoyed at the time the altera
tion? have taken to complete, informed
the builders a month ago that she
wanted them out of the place, bag and
baggage, by the end of July. She re
mon5trated with them at the time of
the King's visit to Ireland for their in
ability to have the place ready for the
reception of his Majesty and the
Queen. She was so disappointed that
she has been writing angry letters al
most weekly to the steward, who is in
charge of the castle, exhorting him to
hurry on the work so that she may. at
least, be able to entertain some Ameri
can friends there before they return
to their own country.

The Irish language has been spoken
for over 2000 years, and was a finished
speech before any of the modern Eu
ropean tongues were lisped. It has an
extensive vocabulary of some 80,000
words and is especially adapted to the
formation of new words out of old ones
and of "Irishing" foreign elements. The
claim is made for it that in linguistlcal
value it ranks next to Sanscrit. Its MS.
literature, now scattered from Arran
to Moscow, is of immense extent: the
portion written priof to the sixteenth
century alone it has been estimated
would fill 1000 octavo . volumes. The
mass of it is of high quality and great
variety â including story, song, legend,
hymn, tracts on religion, works on law,
medicine, botany, life and manners â
affording much of it, the key to the
social origin of the European races. It
has attracted to its study some of the
foremost of Continental scholars â
French, German, Danish and Italian.
One of the most powerful personalities
in connection with the Gaelic revival
is Dr. Kuno Meyer, a German savant.
Entirely at his own expense he gees
through Ireland delivering lectures on
children and see that competent teach
ers are employed.
The league itself affords Instruction
In the ancient language to some 200,000
pupils, young and old, and employs a
staff of paid agents to revive Interest in
the national' tongue in districts where
it has fallen Into disuse. They send
suggestions to the headquarters in Dub
lin as to the best means of encouraging
and reviving Industries hi the different
localities they visit. They get in touch
with employer;* of labor in order to af
ford facilities for the return to their
own land of young Irish menana wom
en who are working abroad. They dis
tribute literature at fairs and markets,
in which the aims of the league are set
forth and emigration is discouraged.
They organize athletic sports, concert?
and entertainments of various sorts,
that the life of the peasantry may be
rendered less, dreary and monotonous
without having recourse to saloons.

theme of discussion will be the best
means of reviving the national spirit-
and stimulated that disastrous emigra

what once were populous districts.
IRISH PEOPLE AWAKE.
The Irish people are awaking to the
fact that the salvation of Ireland can
not be attained by political agitation,
whether revolutionary or constitutional,
and are rallying to the support of the
Gaelic League, in which ancient ani

"In every case," says one commenta
tor, "language was at the forefront of
the national struggle, and the revival
of the ancient language was marked
by the revival of national industries
and resulted in material prosperity."
It is not proposed that English should
be given up. The purpose of the league
is to make Ireland a bi-lingual nation,
using English for x comm rcial pur

The German Emperor has now taken
to the smoking of a most elaborate
pipe, with specially prepared Havana.
This marks a great advances on thÂ»
mild cigarettes with which he com
menced his sovereign career. After that
he crept up to equally mild straw-col
ored cigars of Dutch make, costing a
penny, though these he indulged j n only
at the close of the day. His present
habit he has inherited from his father,
who was a great smoker of the well
known student pipes, such as Bismarck
substituted for cigars toward the end
of his life, and no popular portrait of
"Unser Fritz" was thought to be per
fect without his long, big-bowled pipe.

snuffed, although the latter hablFwaa

"Certainly, and knew that he would

There was a little Barrymore talk

raptured over that awhile. She had

Miss Barrymore chief child of New

Adams. She is older and better known.
Didn't we like her here. Oh. vastly!
They would go to see Miss Adams in

"It seems to me," I said then, "that

LO^TDOX GOWN 3IAKERS
ARE AND UNCERTAIN
The London correspondent of the
E/imatic News has the following in
terest :.Â£ comment upon the recent
joint engagement,therf0;f Mrs. Patrick
Campbell and ferah Bemhardt, in
Maeterlinck's "Pelleas and Melisande:"
"Maeterlinck^ play requires a pe
culiar style of acting. There should be
no touch of realism and the parts must
be played so that the whole does not
lost its allegorical import. Some may
hold that this is impossible on the
stage; that the play is not a play at
all. But you cannot read it without
being struclQlwith the beautiful sim
plicity with which the author has pre
sented his allegory of the soul come as
a light into an obscure world, where
the joy of life has been a stranger. The
human soul (Melisande) has wandered
forth into the world, and has cast away
the crown of spirituality; she is cap
tured against her will by Golaud, the
ordinary man to whom love is a pos
session; but the complement of her be
ing is love, pure, idealistic love, and
-she finds it in Pelleas. The world is
too dense, however, and Golaud. as its
representative, kills the perfect love of
Pelleas and Melisande. All the hope
held out fesi the world is that Meli
sande's chird, half-soul, half-Golaud,
will live. It will be better than a joy
less world without love at all. That,
at least, is the interpretation which I
put on the play, but Maeterlinck is an
artist, and his work has the intelligible
inexplicity of all art that is worthy of
the name. One might as well attempt a
logical explanation of the Tristan and
Isolde, or of ontfjjjof the pictures of
Watts orJBurne-Jones, or the sculpture
of Rodiiyor Gilbert. But as I said at
the outset, the play requires the whole
to be brought out with consistent clear
ness, and this demands a peculiar style
of acjing. It cannot be said that Mrs.
Patrick Campbell quite grasps the idea
of Melisande. I thought that of her
acting of the part in English, and
yesterday, being hampered by the
foreign language, it was even more
noticeable. Her Melisande has no
mystery; she is an ordinary woman
who has married when quite " a girl
a man whom she does not care for. and
falls really in love with his brother.
A very graceful woman, it is true,
with a strange charm, but still only a
woman. It was here that the genius of
Sarah Bernhardt was so clearly proved.
From beginning to end her Pellea* was
an allegorical figure, taking its proper
part in the picture. Hardly a word
missed its significance. And what music
there was in her voice! What melting
modulations of tone in that beautiful
love scene beneath Melisande's window,
and what elaljon of passion in that
other when the love of the two reaches
its climax. It was not ordinary love
making, but a poetical paean to love in
the abstract as the author evidently in
tended It should be. Perhaps the very
fact that a woman was acting the part
of Pelleas helped toward the illusion,
nr@.klng the love less realistic and more
abstrac!^ At any rate, it was a singu
larly beautiful performance.
The golaud of M. Decouer was
powerful in the ordinary stage style,
and for that very reason it did not
create the right atmosphere. The vio
lence of the man when he finds out that
his love is not just because he has
bound it with his hands should have
been more restrained, and the charac
ter as a whole should have had its
being in a world_cf gloom. The smaller
parts of ,'ind Arkell, how
ever, were played in quite the* right
spirit by Mme. Germain and M. Cealis,
and the little Yrrkrid was well done by
Mile. Raymonds, o the self-possessed
child who made suen a hit '.^i Zaza. The
difficulties' of staging wen smoothly
overcome. It;vas a pity so many outs
and transpositions were held to be
necessary, and it was a shame that th( j
audience did not liste*: to M. Gabriel
Fault's entr'actes. The French com
poser has splendidly caught the spirit
of the play, and if there had been less
chattering during the short entr'actes,
the Interest would have been more con
tinuous, for though the play itself is
cut up into many Bu.nes, the dramatic
idea Is as gradually expressed, and with
as organic a consistency as a Greek
play or a social drama of Ibsen's." U

of a recent enterprise here the follow
ing may be of Interest to the dealers
and exporters of meats in the United
States: Owing to the prevailing high
prices In Belgium for butchers' meat
of all kinds, attention has lately been
directed to the importation of beef and
mutton in cold storage. A large Im
portation was made from La Plata and
shops were opened in several of the
cities of Belgium for the sale of the
meat, which was retailed at prices va-'
rying from seven to fourteen cents per
pound, or nearly four and a half cents
per pound less than native beef and
mutton. The meat is reputed to be of
excellent quality and tne unexpected
competition has created considerable
uneasiness among the butchers in lo
calities where the imported meats are
sold. The meat is sent in cold storage
direct from Argentina to Antwerp^-

At last the auto meet at Del Monte
has been set for August 18. and already
preparations are afoot for the largest
gathering of machines and auto en
thusiasts ever held on the coast.
The roads about Monterey are in such
shape that a spin over them is a joy
forever, the whole length of the seven
teen-mile drive being oiled and conse
quently jn excellent shape.* This, by the
way, is no inconsiderable part of El
Camed Real.
Whatever of social life the resorts are
offering, Del Monte seems to be lead
ing. Some very interesting peopleaxe
there now, among whom are Mrs. AT N.
Tou'ne, who -wears the most exquisite
gowns one could conjure up. Wtth her
is her daughter, Mrs. Clinton A. Wor
den, who, too, understands the art of
wearing clothes.
Spoaking'of clothes, Ned Greenway,
commentator on clothes and , other
things and immortal social Caesar, led
a very. jubilant parly of â¢ bon; vivants,
including young Joe Tobin.
By the wrfy, speaking of young To

bowling. Last Saturday night he regis

what think youâ he. was abroad In the

which he attended with most commend

What -" singular psychological phe

Friday night. His skull had been

a sharp piece of rock which had pen
etrated under his right Â«ye.and en
tered the brain.
When Held, was restored to his

beneath the eye was noticed, but it
seemed Insignificant and no attention

NEW YORK, July 30.â J. Plerpont
Morgan had a very narrow escape from
death this afternoon while riding up
Broadway -with a friend in his large
coach automobile. Morgan's machine
was going at a good pace behind a Co
lumbus avenue car,. when the car was
suddenly run Into head on by another
large touring automobile. The car
stopped quickly, and it was only by
dexterous manipulating that the auto
mobile of Morgan was turned. ' â¢
The accident occurred Just before 3
o'clock. The Columbus avenue car,
going north, was passing Fourth street.
At the curb on an angle was a large
touring car. The chauffeur of this car
suddenly turned the lever, and the car
backed with great swiftness into the
trolley. The shock Jolted the car,
which lurched, but kept on the tracks.
The right-^nd rail was smashed into
kindling wood. On the rear of the
auto was a large basket containing a
repairing kit. This was crushed, and
the automobile was bent and scraped,
although not so badly damaged that
the Journey could not be continued.
Riding on the rear seat of the car
was J. Ordones, 21 years old, of 132
West , Sixteenth street. He was swing T
ing his left foot over the edge of the
car. The automobile" struck his foot,
tore his trousers leg to shreds and bad
ly bruised his leg and shoulder.
â¢ Morgan at the time was leaning for-
ward, smoking and chatting with his
friend. The sudden Jolt caused his
Panama hat to fall to the back of his
head. He called his chauffeur to stop,
and the machine was brought to a
standstill with a Jolt, only a few inches
separating it from the trolley car.

J PIERPONT MORGAN, THE WORLD-FAMOUS FINANCIER. WIIO HAS HAI> A
NARROW ESCAPE FROM DEATH WHILE RIDING IN AN AUTOMOBILE
ON A CROWDED NEW TORK STREET, .. !"-'
Notice was served yesterday after
noon upon local representatives of the
Southern Pacific and Santa Fe rail
roads and upon local shlppe.- to the
effect that the steamships controlled by
the Harriman Interests would receive
no freight for any port In Japan, Man
churia, Korea or Slberlc, or for New
chwang. This refusal applies to the
steamship China, now receiving freight
at the Pacific Mall wharf and sched
uled to sail on August 6 for the Far
East.
TONS OF FREIGHT PILING UP.
This decision probably will save
steamships leaving from now on from
any serious Interference at the hands
of the hostile navies, but it leaves rail
roads and shippers with a pretty prob
lem on their hands. There are many
tons of freight for Japan here now and
on the way across the continent. De
livery of j much of this has been guar
anteed and upon delivery of some of
it Japan is placing implicit depend
ence.
One four-hundred-ton lot of Japan
destined freight Includes the material
for two submarine boats, as well as
chemicals to be used in the manufac
ture of high explosives.
The presence in port of the Jap
anese liner America Maru is regarded
as providential, but her ability to re
lieve the. situation is limited by her
carrying capacity, and she already has
1400 tons of freight in her hold. She
was scheduled to sail to-morrow, but
will be held until she has taken all
the freight for Japan she can carry.
NATURE OF THE MARU'S CARGO.
The Maru's cargo, as far as now.
loaded, consists of half-crushed salt,
for use in the manufacture of ex
plosives, and soda ash, to\_be used in
tanning the green hides shipped on
the Gaelic. Korea and Mongolia.
When tanned in Jaoan this leather
will be made into shoes and saddles
for the Japanese soldiers.
The Korea's narrow escaDe sent a
nervous chill throughout the Harri
man system, and - the heads of that
organization will rest easier,when the
Gaelic and Mongolia get rid of -all
Action taken yesterday by the Har
riman steamship lines Is fraught with
serious Import for Japan and may have
material influence on the island king
dom's ability to cope with her power
ful enemy in the Far East. To avoid
e-en the appearance of filibustering
and to keep the corporate skirts clear
of the contamination of anything that

classed as contraband, freight destined

hereafter by the steamships of the Pa

RENO. Nev., July 30.â As a result of
a cloudburst this afternoon the towns
of Douglass and Silver Star, near Soda
ville, Nev., are reported to have been
swept a"way. The news wa3 telephoned
to Agent Richards at Sodaville and was
to the effect that a cloudburst torrent
Was sweeping: away houses and that
great property damage had been
wrought. The schoolhouse and four
dwellings are known to have been
swept away.';'- * -
Ten minutes after the first news was
received at Sodaville the wire was in
terrupted, and it could not be learned
how many lives, if any, were lost.
There is great excitement at Sodaville,
as the people have been warned to
watch for bodies. The volume of water
is increasing at that.place.
Near New .Boston, six miles iiorth of
Sodaville, the Carson and Colorado
Railroad is covered with water to tho
depth of six inches for a Â°d!stanca of
half a mile, and at Rhodes, three miles
south of here, the same condition pre

last night sent down a,- wall of water
thirty feet high throcgh the canyon,

track, embankments, bridges, telegraph
poles and everything movable for a dis
tance of twelve miles.
Hundreds of men have been hurried
to the washout by the Santa Fe, but
it will be some time before the water
subsides sufficiently to allow the work
men to reconstruct the roadbed and
bridges.
* Three miles of the Arizona and Utah
track was washed out to-day, and it
will take several days to make re
pairs.
A report reaches Klngman of a
cloudburst at Cedar, a mining camp
eighty miles south of here, which
caused great damage.
PHOENIX, Ariz., July SO.â More rain
has fallen here in the last ten days
than during any July since 1S36. A
severe electrical storm last night did
slight damage to three or four resi

PARIS. July 30. â Foreign Minister
Delcasse this afternoon addressed a
note to the papal nuncio to the effect
that, in consequence of the rupture of
the relations between France and the
Vatican, his mission In Paris no longer
had any object.
The papal nuncio, who was visiting
the Countess de Villeneuve/ near Ver
sailles, was unofficially informed of
the situation last night and returned
to Paris immediately. He sent long
cipher messages to Some this morn
ing.
The rupture between France and the
Vatican is complete. The Holy See's
lengthy reply to the French note,
though courteously worded, merely
amounts to a polite statement that the
Pope does not intend to infringe the
stipulations of the concordat and* will
eiot withdraw the letters calling, the
Bishops of Dijon and Laval to Rome.
Diplomatic courtesy forbids the pub
lication of the French answer until
the Pope is notified, but Foreign Min
ister Delcasse last v night sent to De
Courcel. the French Charge d' Affaires
at the Vatican, two notes; one for the
Papal Secretary of State, announcing
the rupture, and the second a per
sonal note to the charge and the
others of the staff of the embassy, to
.return to Paris immediately after his
mission is accomplished. When De
Courcel's advices reach Foreign Min
ister Delcasse, the latter will imme
diately request the papal nuncio here
to leave France.
It is not expected that the rupture
will have any immediate consequences
beyond the mutual withdrawal of the
representatives of France and the*
Vatican and the suppression of the
embassy and nunciature, as . the de
nunciation of the concordat requires
.preliminary 1 sanction. Consequently
fresh developments are improbable un
til the appointment of the new Bishops^
come up. Â»Well informed persona do
not believe that the Vatican will re
taliate by withdrawing France's pro
tectorate over the Eastern Catholics.
The Rome correspondent of the
Temps telegraphs that the French
Government's" dispatch did not arrive
at the Vatican embassy until after the
officials left last night and was not
delivered until this morning. De
Ccurcel conferred with the "Papal Sec
retary of State, Cardinal Merry del
Val, at 10 o'clock this morning and
it was believed he would leave Rome
to-night. 3vA
The rupture of relations between
France and the Vatican does not cause
surprise. It had been generally fore
seen that Premier Combes was deter
mined to bring it about despite the op
position which doubtless he met from
certain members of the Cabinet The
impression prevails that the Govern
ment will be satisfied with what it has
done and that it will not seek to re
peal the concordat when Parliament
reassembles.
Tho fact that the Vatican's reply to
the French note was drawn up in Ital
ian causes some Irritation.
ROME, July 30.â The note severing
the relations between France and the
Vatican was couched In the following
terms:
"After having on several occasions
pointed out the several blows struck
.at the Government right under the con
cordat by the Vatican's dealing direct
ly with the French Bishops, without
consultation with the power w.ith
which the concordat was signed, and
seeing that the pontifical secretary of
state, in his reply of July 25, affirmed
these proceedings, the French Govern
ment has decided to conclude official
relations with the Holy See, whose de
sire had become objectless."
Papal Secretary of State Merry del
Val says that an order to leave Paris
will be telegraphed to Mgr. Lorenzelli."
The nuncio left Paris to-night for
Rome.

cious hissing of the hurrying messen
gers of death; exploding shrapnel shells
formed clouds of smoke overhead, into
which were thrown fountains of dust
and sand When the shells burst on the
ground upon impact, showering bullets
and splinters around.
The Japanese fire was at first concen
trated upon the eastward hill, held by a
small force of Russians, and by 11
o'clock this part of the position was lit
erally aflameâ enough to try the cour
age of the bravest soldier. When this
had lasted four or five hours one after
another of the Russian positions be
came untenable. , .
In the meantime the gunners serving
the Russian batteries beyond 'the hills
redoubled their energies," and the Japa
nese were, evidently nonplused by the
fierceness of the fire from the unlo
catable batterjes. They even directed
their attention to the Russian right,
showering projectiles on a small hill
which was quite unoccupied. Then the
Japanese shifted their fire to the Rus
sian center, but not a single man was
withdrawn therefrom.
GUNNERS CHANGE POSITION.
The fire from the Japanese dimin
ished about 2 o'clock and ceased alto
gether a half-hou/ later, whereas the
Russian batteries continued; to fire.
When the Japanese gunners 'reopened
the artillery duel later they had
changed their position to the westward,
whence they obtained an Uninterrupted
range of the plain behind the Russian
position, jj and their projectiles began
falling dangerously near the Russian
batteries. The Chinese villages in the
vicinity suffered terribly. The whole
plain was plowed and pitted by the ex
plosion of the shells.
With the approach of evening the
Russians had a little relief from the
heat, but none from the Japanese, the
only difference : belng that the flashes
of the Japanese guns were distinguish
able on the slopes of the hills facing
the Russians, revealing their exact po
sition by the red sparks of each can
non's mouth against "the somber shad
ow, followed by the bursting of shells
over the Russians.
The wild beauty of the scene had
now reached its zenith, the bombard
ment slowly diminishing in Intensity,
and a half hour later profound si
lence reigned, broken only now and
then by the rattle of infantry volleys
from the distant portions of the field,
where the battle was still dragging
on.
Upon reaching Sinmintin the same
evening the correspondent found that
i,lhe place had already been abandoned,
by the Russian troops, though he was
for a,r time under the Impression that
they had merely gone out to take up
positions at the, front. In fact, he was
convinced that" the' fight must have
been a Russian victory, since over the
great extent of field which had come
under his observation for thirteen
hours the Japanese at no point
seemed able to . advance. Therefore,
great was his surprise on Monday
morning when he %woke to find the
Russian army retreating.
RETREAT IN GOOD ORDER.
J'umplng into the saddle, the cor
respondent rode ojut of the village and
encountered a large force of Russian
cavalry covering an infantry regiment,
which was moving toward Tatchekiao.
On reaching that town the corre
spondent found everything prepared
for its evacuation. The last train left
Tatchekiao at about 11 o'clock, at
which time the Japanese were already
bombarding the place. Notwithstand
ing the fire, and even the rapid ap
proach of the Japanese, the Russian
retreat was carried out in perfect or
der, although the men and animals
suffered terribly from the stifling heat
The Russian stores of flour and
other- provisions at Tatchekiao were
burned and as the correspondent rode
northward immense columns of black
were rising along the horizon
behind him and until he approached
Haicheng at 8 o'clock last night he
could hear the distant rumbling ojf the
Japanese guns.
SLAV GUNS WELL CONCEALED.
ST. PETERSBURG, July 30.â A spe-.
cial dispatch from Llaoyang, # giving a.
graphic picture of the fight -at Tatche-'
kiao, explains that, the Russian immu-.
nity from damage by the furious Japa-.
nese bombardment was due to the fact
that the Russian guns were mostly be-,
hind a range of steeu hills and were
poncealed cleverly by high grass and
trees, and. that the Chinese therefore
were unable to heliograph the position
of the guns, as they formerly had done,
to the Japanese artillerymen.
The Japanese had many large caliber
guns and, jjsed chiefly shrapnel. They
used also high explosive shells. The
fight was almost wholly an artillery*
duel and was a magnificent spectacle.
The crest of the hills held by the Rus
sians was converted into the semblance
of a volcano, and earth was thrown up
In clouds by the continuous rain of
bursting shells, until sand and dust
hung overhead and fire among the trees
and grass, started by the shells, added
a stifling smoke and heat to the awful
glare of the sun. The shrapnel, like
great," white-winged birds, sailed over
head. The moan and drone of their
coming could be plainly heard, and the
Russians threw 'Â¦ themselves .behind
rocks and other shelter as tlfe missiles
burst.. >
The Japanese shifted, the position of i
their guns, both to escape the Russian
fire and to try to locate the masked
.batteries of their opponents. Late^in
.the afternoon they got into a position
that enabled them to sweep the plain
behind the hills occupied by the Rus
sians, :^nd came dangerously near lo
cating, though they did not quite find,
the Russian batteries. * ' â¢
Every one except the commanders
was surprised and disgusted at the order
to retreat., # The Russians burned every
thing valuable ' # at Â¦ Tatchekiao before
leaving ; #

has been going on around Port Arthur

CHEFU, July 30.â A junk which left
Port At'hur on Thursday at midnight
reports terrific fighting on land and

three <i,--5-s. The highest Japanese
authority here says that the army and
naval commanders of the besiegiqg
forces had planned to begin their final
assault on Tuesday last and expected
to effect the capture by July 29, but '
that no official reports were cxÂ»j<?cted
from the army or from Admiral Togo
until the present attack resulted . in
success or failure. JapaneA- corre

to the Mlaotao Islands, ready to enter

after the fall of the fortress. â¢

It was essentially an artillery battle,
but it - as remarkable, and even un

was fired, but the gunners on both
NO JAPANESE IX, SIGHT.
â¢ The real battle opened the 'next
morning. . The first gurf was fired at
'7 o'clock and thenceforth the roar of
artillery did not cease for an instant
until 8:30 o'clock in the evening. At
times the firing acquired extraordin
ary violence.'. Â®
The site of the battle was about
three miles south of Tatchekiao and
two miles 'east of the railroad. The
sea was plainly discernible from the
heights overlooking the battle. But
nothing occurred in that direction. The
Russian positions fronted south, with
a slight inclination eastward. About
two artillery corps were engaged.
The correspondent was able to follow
only the experiences of General Zarou
baieff *s corps, and so confines himself
to recording the incidents of that por
tion of the Russian troops. Zarou
baieff'sÂ®corps occupied a position on
two hills, of which the larger was
crowned by three summits. The com
mander and his staff stationed them
selves on the highest point, the center
one, whence they had an uninterrupted
view of the surrounding country. The
gefleral had placed batteries on the
plain beyond these hills, the guns being
cleverly masked by lofty Chinese corn.
The Japanese tried vafnly the whole
day to locate them? and the Russian
losses therefore were slight. The men
suffered more from the scorching heat
of the s'un than from the Japianese*pro
jectiles.
The night was perfectly quiet. The
slept in the viljage of
Sinmintin, directly behind the Rus
sian positions.
ALL-DAY ARTILLERY DUEL.
j TOKIO, July 30.â The Japanese casu
alties at the, battle of Tatchekiao were
12 officers and 136 men willed and 47 of
ficers and 848 men wounded, a total of
1043 killed or wounded.
MUKDEN, July 30.â A correspond
ept of the Associated Press who wit
nessed the battle of Tatchekiao, July
23 to-July 25, and who rode,more than
a* hundred* miles on horseback, all the
way to Mukden, to bring the account,
gives the following description of the
engagement:. V"-'' i
The correspondent was awakened at
5. o'clock in the morning of July 23
by the booming of guns. ' He had slept
in the village of Tientsin, four miles
south of Tatchekiao, where the regi
ment to which he was attached was
stationed. He hurriedly rode to the
Russian outposts and found them en
gaged in a hot artillery duel, which
continued for Â«lx 'hours. Then the
batteries slowly retreated on the main
position, where General Zaroubaieff
decided to acpept battle. The Rus
sian gunners thence .poured a well di
rected hail of projectiles, effectually
stopping the Japanese advance and
enabling the various outpost detach
.ments to fall back in safety. The ar
tillery fire ceased at about 11 o'clock
and then, for three hours the Japanese
Â«vereÂ« engaged in placing their bat
teries in position and in disposing of
; their forces in order of battle.
j At 2 o'clock in the afternoon the
bombardment recommenced and Jast
ed until 5 o'clock. The Japanese* had

a little surprise for them when they pay
their next visit.
I might menlion, by the way, In this
connection that on his return from
Soutb Africa the Japanese military at
tache with the English forces during
the. Boer war presented a voluminous
report to. the Mikado.
Not a word of this document, which
excited muca speculation at tha time,
was made known to the* public, but I
should not be surprised if it pointed out
# how easJJy the tactics of Dewet could
be imitated by bands of Japanese
horsemen roaming' through Manchuria,
supporting themselves on the country,
getting Information of the Russian
movements and the disposition of the
Russian forces ; from the friendly In
habitants and breaking the railway and
jtelegraph lines as often as possible.
The Japanese seem to have learned
very boom of this condition of affairs,
for soon after they had crossed the
Yalu mounted* bands of themâ -each
band being several thousand strong
swept over the country to the. east of
the railroad. â¢
Considering that the Japanese ane no
toriously bad horsemen, riding indlffer
j ent horses and pitted against the finest
j riders in the .world, with practically the
j whole of the great horse-breeding re
gion of Mongolia at their disposal^ their
temerity in venturing so far as they did
into the heart of Manchuria is astound
â¢ing. Â¦ '

CHICAGO, July 30.â The conflict be
tween capital asd unionism, which has
been going on In the packing trade In
dustry throughout the country for
nearly three weeks, shows no sign of
abatement. To-night both of the op
posing Interests seezn as determined as
ever on k fight to a finish.
The packers to-night declared they
h*d practically won their fight and
that the strikers were becoming de
znorallxed. In direct opposition to this
statement of the employers the strike
leaders asserted that the victory was
with the workmen and that it would
be a. matter of but a short time until
the packers were compelled t<Ll<*k for
peace.
Leaders of four of the allied trades
unions which went on strike In
sympathy with the packing-house
butchers are said by the packers to
have made overtures for reinstate
ment to-day. According to the pack
ers, the emissaries from these four
skilled trades sought to learn upon
what terms the strikers would be re
instated should they return In a body.
The answer the packers say they gave
to these peace missionaries was that
the strikers would be re-employed as
fest as conditions might warrant, but
only as Individuals and n<jt as mem
bers of any union.
The strike leaders disclaimed any
knowledge whatever of the action,
taken by the four unions and repeated
their that the outlook for
victory for the striking workmen was
more satisfactory than ever.

MUKDEN, Monday, May 30. â For
t!Â£Â» last two hours the air has been
filled with the whistling of locomo
tives on the railway, which, runs at a
short distance from the Littna temple,
in which I am writing, and this sound
will probably continue, with hardly .a
break, for the rest of the day and for
all the coming: night, as it has con
tinued for months pasfc~^_"
Sometimes itT Is a short, sharp
scream; oftener'lt Is fk prolonged wall.
But. whatever form It takes there is
no sound save the sound of guns that
excites more Interest and^ apprehen
sion In Mukden at the present mo
ment than the whistle of the ordinary
railway locomotive.
I need not point out why thisUs the
case, for In no war that ever was
wared has the railway been such an
Important factor as In? the present

ruary last. â¢
Russia has accordingly 1 told off an
army merely to guard that long rail
way, while Stjl Japan's efforts, the at
tacks on Purt Arthur, the Invasion of
Manchuria and the landings along the
Liaotung coast have had for their (Ob
ject the cutting of that frail but for
midable line of steel.' , @i
SOLDIERS GUARD BRIDGE.
TlÂ»~ attention the Russians have be
stowcJ on their railway since the out
break of the war has been such that
the Chinese might be excused for be
lles tie that the railway locomotive is
the -'European's god," and ttjat if not
watched day and night by fervent
worshipers with rifles in their hands
that iron deity might Inflict som?
dreadful punishment on its recalci
trant worshipers.
After Japan began the way some
thing UK* a panic seized upon "the
Russians with regard to their railway
and Cossacks used to ride along the
line by night carrying flashlights, by
means of which they could ascertain
if the rails had been pampered wlth (
anywhere. . <Â¦
Admiral Alexieff even issued a proc
lamation* calling "on the Chinese to'
proton the line, but I do not think*
that this proclamation had the slight
est effect.
The elaborate measures r; taken to
protect the bridges arc already known*
to the public. A considerable body of
soldiers is generally stationed on each
sido of a bridge, which, is also protect
ed by at least one field piece.* The ap
proaches to the bridge are lined by
sandbags" which sometimes .extend
down the rfver bank for a distance of
several hundred yards. Nobody is al
lowed to approach the, bridge unless
he is a Russian officer in uniform and
is provided with all sorts of permits,
signed ami countersigned by dozens of
officials. ,*
Every beam of a bridge 4s watched*'

What would have happened
"to me if I hatf crossed within sight of
a big bridge I shudder to contemplate.
On one or two occasions on which I
passed near a snfall bridge I had with
me a Chinese "mafoo," w^o looks sus
piciously like^a Japanese, being small,
Â¦wearing corduroys and generally wear
â¢fng^his queue wound up Inside of a Eu
ropean hat.
As soon as the soldier on guard at the
bridge saw me cross the line he sum
moned his companion, and they "asked
who I was.
I explained to them In my best Rus
sian,' and at a distance of about a hun
dred yards.0 that I "was a war corre
spondent atid :. that everything y as ln

They wanted to get a nearer view of

come closer. I obeyed with alacrity, as
<hey had guns in their hands, but I
wondered what would happen to a man
who, under similar circumstances, did
,not know â¢nough* Russian to 'untie!*
stand them and continued to ride on.
o TRY TO .INJURE ROAD. â¢
Abottt the t1me*I was Jhus stopped on
the railway several bodies of mounted
Japanese, each party numbering sev
eral thousand, h*<J3actually found their
way, in direct Imitation of DeWet when
he invaded Cape Cblony, as far as thir
ty miles to the north of MukBen, their
object being presumably to ascertain
*.s much as they ccruld of the disposition
of the Russian forces and at the same
â¢time to injure the Railway.
Repeated attempts were made by
them to carry ouf. this latter part of
'their programmed and although thege
attempts invariably failed they natur
ally increased the solicitude witfi which
the Russians looked after their line.
Similar attempts were made between
Slukden and &iapya1ng, and*bnly a few
days ago six Japanese cavalrymen were
captured In the vicinity of the latter
town. Â¦?.' e
The Japanese jiot.only seiyT mounted
scoujts in uniform to attack* the rail
way, but they also send peaceful and
"heavily paid Ofcinamen, as well as
Japanese dressecT as Chinamen and
< bands of Chinese* robbers' ttf attempt
the same delicate'operation. Â®
< Sometimes the, encounters between
, the Russians who want to guard the
line and the Huflghuses who want to
wreck it /â¢attain*... serious dimensions.
Abqut a week ago a band' of Chines/;
0 Hunghuses attached a Cossack* detach*
. ; ment and did not retreat untfl Â£hey had
lost twenty of their number.
These attempts make everybody in
â¢Mukden tfnxiously listen for the;whist
ling of the railway locomotives, "so far,
as I have alrea'dy remarked, that
whistling has bi-en almost continuous.
In fact, the railway has fully justified
; all the hopes placed in it.
GREAT PIECE OF WORK.
It is a mantel, and if it continues to
do its duty for a*nother four montns
, the Russians should treat it . as the
Japanese treat "mountains which have
'^rendered distinguished service to the
; country" by ornamenting Â«the land
j.pcape, and should*, make .it henceforth
incumbent oh every loyal subject of the
* Czar to speak of the railway as "Mon
sieur the Railway," In yie same wfey as
the Japanese speak of Fujiyama as
Fujisan. 'â¢
* Prince Khilkoff.certainly deserves the
decoration he recently received for the
magnificent, work*' the railway is doing
under his management. The amount of
that work is not properly, appreciated
by anybody who does not see the trains
, ,ro past. . '
I have never seen a more imposing ex
hibition of the power and might -of
Russia than I have witnessed day after
day during the last four weeks at Muk
den.
The endlessrprqcession of implements
of destruction and of men to make us#
of .them dwarf into utter significance
I any -procession that I have ever seen,
! although at times I cannot help ask
| ing myself, as I watch them rolling
! swiftly past, how many of these brave
! young fellows will ever come back.
A partial answer to my question is
supplied by the hospital trains.. These
j trains consist of spotlessly clean white
| carriages with a red cross painted out

! about inside like angels of mercy. In
stead of.: being, as one would expect,
i abodes of pain, they are filled with

I did not envy, the occupants. None

, dangerous cases had to be treated as
j near the front as possible, ar.d all
i seemed to be perfectly happy and con-
! tented.
As I walked about the Mukden rail

semblymen it is not difficult to count
noses. Assemblyman Goodrich of
Pasadena probably will be returned
and Assemblyman Johnstone is certain
to be. Both have declared for Bard.
The man who succeeds Assemblyman
Camp in the Alhambra district will
also be a Bard man, for such la the
sentiment of that community that this
is conceded. Assemblyman Kelso of
Inglewood also "favors Bard, but the
Flint forces are making a desperate
effort to control his convention. Of
the others, all of whom are to be
chosen from districts within the* city,
Stanton and Transue' are Flint men;
McCartney Is on the fence, leaning
toward the Flint side, and Houser is
classed as doubtful. The Flint forces
are claiming the district now repre
sented by Carter and they probably
will control it. -
The probable result will therefore
be not unlike that of two years ago,
made. To predict the probable result
would be simply speculation. In whclh
any person may indulge.
Political prophets are looking ask
ance at Sari Diego Counts and her
three votes. There the Congressional
fight Is a decided factor. Senator
Ward is making a fight to succeed
Congressman Daniels of Riverside, his
opponent being former Senator S. C.
Smith of Bakersfleld. The scandal
which followed the defalcations of
"ex-Boss" Tom Hays of Riverside
eliminated Daniels from this contest,
but he is still believed to have some
influence as a result of the patronage
which it was his privilege to dis
tribute, and that influence, whatever
it may amount to, has been cast in
the direction of Ward.
In Los Angeles County the brands
with which the various candidates are
stamped may be easily read in pass
ing; there are no mavericks. The
one man who has declared openly for
Flint is Hahn, Pasadena's hold-over
State Senator, but Flint has others
roped and tied, although they have
made no open declarations. Senator
Pondleton is in the Flint corral to
stay, but what Senator Savage will do
it is not so safe to predict. He bolted
the Republican caucus at the last ses
sion of the Legislature when Senator
Perkins was chosen. So did Senator
Fred Smith and for that Smith prob
ably will not be returned to the Legis
lature. Assemblyman Henry E. Carter 1
stand3 the best chance of winning in
Smith's district, and Flint's name will
be upon his ballot S. C. Graham, a
well-to-do oil man, is Carter's op
ponent, but Graham i3 comparatively j
a novice in the political game. In. the
Senatorial district of which Pomona
is 'the center, Assemblyman Camp and
former Assemblyman Broughton are
the candidates and both have declared*
for Bard.
The Democratic insurgents, under the
leadership of James H. O'Brien, will
make a determined fight to elect a ma
jority of delegates to the local nomin
ating convention of the party. The reg
ular or county committee Derrfocrats,
under the direction of Gavin McNab,
will nominate delegates in every As

The Republicans of the Thirty
ninth District met in Richmond Hall
last evening and after temporary offi
cers had been elected a permanent
organization was formed under the
name of the United Independent Re

two organizations, one known as the
Citizens' Independent Republican Club
and the other as the Independent Re

both were present and all agreed that
harmony was necessary for party suc

combined. The officers .of tMe new
organization are: John R. Aitken,
president; E. T. McMurray, first vice
president; S. J. Hendy, second vice
president; Adolph Gerhart, third vice
president; John J. Cassidy, secretary;

ACTIVE WORK
IN POLITICS
The Republican district committee of
the Thirty-sixth Assembly District met
Friday evening at the office of Charles
H. J. Truman, 1909 Mission street, and
organized by electing the following per
manent officers: Chairman, Charles H.
J. Truman; vice chairman, H. W. Fra-
â¢ A victory for the insurgents at the
primary election one week from next
Tuesday would give O'Brien the power
to name the nominees for State Sen
ators, Assemblymen and four Judges of
the Superior Court The Democrats
have a fair chance of winning two Sen
atorial and four Assembly districts. It
is common gossip in political circles
that the Democratic organization has
already entered into some agreement
with representatives of the Republican
organization respecting the nomination
of Superior Judges. There are predic
tions, too, that the Republican conven
tion will not ratify the agreement.
â¢ A COVETED COMPLIMENT.
The Democrats do not entertain the
slightest hope of winning the Legisla
ture, hence the contest for United
States Senator cuts little or no figure in
the party squabbles, but the compli
mentary vote of the Democratic legis
lators is frequently the cause of strife
and bickering. If O'Brien wins out he
will give the compliment to Charles J.
Heggerty, the law partner of George A.
Knight, and this it is said will give
Heggerty more votes for the office of
United States Senator than his Repub
lican associate will get. Of course,
Franklin K. Lane will be indorsed for
United States Senator if McNab wins
out. The compliment of Democratic
support for the high office of Senator
would be very acceptable to James D.
Phelan, but many of the statesmen of
his party hold to the opinion that he
ought to be satisfied with his present
exalted postâ that of president of the
Bohemian Club.
Timothy Spellacy, chairman of the
Democratic State Central Committee,
has appointed the following members

lowers for Inviting the conflict, because
he has everything to gain'-and nothing
to lose in the struggle. A McNab re
verse at the primary election August 9
would not give his adversaries control
of the Democratic works, as the adroit
boss was clever enough early in the
campaign to seize the city and State
organizations. A new State committee
cannot be chosen until 1906, and the
present county committee will serve
until 1905. * - â¢
Mr. Welch's address was warmly ap
plauded and'upon motion a committee
of seventeen, was appointed to select
delegates to run in opposition to those
named by the organization. The fol
lowing compose the Selection Commit
tee: Fred N. Bent, Hallie B. Davld
jRon, Ed. Barry, William McKoen,
Joseph Armstrong was elected presi
dent of the club, the other officers se
lected being as follows: First vice pres
ident, Fred Cosgrove; Â¦ second vice
president, Captain C. E. Douglass;
third vice president, Thomas Cavan
augh; treasurer, George W. Penning
ton; secretary, Hallie B. Davidson;
sergeant-at-arms, Thomas Ryan.
After the preliminary work had been
disposed of, Senator Welch announced
to the large assembly the object of the
meeting. He said that outside Influ
ences .were reaching Into the district
in an effort to control its political des
tiny, and this without consulting the
voters of the district As he believed
jn home rule, he said, he thought the
residents of the district should take
action to thwart the outside organiza
tion and place a ticket of delegates in
the field in opposition to that the or
ganization seeks to elect at. the pri
maries. : -.'â¢Â¦;+ -: : Â¦Â¦':Â¦Â¦'.'
A warm contest is scheduled for the,
primaries in the Thirty-second Assem
bly District. The effort of the Ruef
organization to control political affairs
in this southern belt of the city has
been brought to a sudden halt and if
he defeats his opponents it wjty jte only
after sanguinary conflict. '
In an effort to name the Assembly
man from this district and the Sena
tor from the Nineteenth Senatorial
District, composed of the Thirty-sec
ond and the Thirty-fifth Assembly dis
tricts, the organization has appointed
a committee to select delegates from
these districts to the State and the
Legislative and Judicial conventions.
It is claimed, that in the appointment
of the committee Ruef failed to confer
with the voters of the district as to
their wishes. The . result Is that last
night, under the leadership of Senator
R. J. Welch, Supervisor Fred Bent and
State Central Committeeman Joseph
Armstrong, the opposition met in
Maennerbund Hall, Protrero avenue,
near Twenty- fourth street, and organ
ized, taking the name of the Roosevelt
Club of the Thirty-second Assembly
District.
The contest for supremacy and con
trol in the district is between Super
visor Fred Eggers and John W. Rogers.
As seven of the eleven on the district
committee are Rogers' personal and po
litical friends, the officers of the com
mittee having been named by the ma
jority, there is an Impression that they
will name the entire delegation. They
will have the backing of the organiza
tion in their fight against Eggers..

ser; secretary, H. J. Alexander; treas-"
urer, Charles H. Mayer.
The minority of the committee, rep
resenting Fred Eggers and his follow
ing, demanded the privilege of naming
one-half the delegates on both the State
and local tickets. After some discussion
the committee rejected the proposition
and authorized the officers of the com
mittee to select the delegates to the
State and municipal conventions, and
instructed the committee to file a list
of delegates with the Registrar and the
secretary of the Republican County
Committee.

when Los Angeles County was divided
along almost the same lines for and
against Gage. Those who were most
active In th.e Gage fight are now doing
the heavj work for Flint, with this
significant difference, howevVr, that
hundreds of prominent business men
are members of the Flint organization.
By a simple mathematical calculation
it may be seen how Southern Califor
nia stand3 to-day, but between now
and August 9, the day t>f the primaries
in this county, there may be many
charges.
Rich Strikes of Quicksilver.
LOS ANGELES, July SO.â The three
cornered fight now being waged by
Bard, Oxnar^ and Frank Flint, in
which a seat in the United' States Sen
ate is the prize, is not unlike the mem
orable campaign of two years ago,
when Henry T. Gage was endeavoring
to secure" indorsement of his political
acts and methods by asking the people
to return him to Sacramento as Gov
ernor of the State. There is not in the
present contest that personal and po
litical bitterness which characterized
the Gage campaign, but in many other
respects the fight is being waged along
the same lines and with practically the
same dlvlsllon of the party. This is
particularly true of Los Angeles Coun
ty, but it applies also, but in lesser de
gree, to the other sections of Southern
California.
, Believing that the political leaders in
the north* are honest in their reputed
Bta'tements that they concede to the
south one of the United States Sen
ators and that they will support any
candidate upon whom the couth agrees,
the Republicans of this part of the
State are* paying little if any attention
to political happenings In the north,
but each candidate Is seeking to secure
a majority of the Southern California
delegation to the next Legislature.
There has been no agreement thaÂ£ the j
unit rule will be applied to this dele
gation and that a majority will carry
with It the votes of all, but some such
agreement Is more than possible, and
anticipating it the several candidates
are devoting their energies to the home
counties.
Despite the fact that several county
conventions have "instructed" one way
or another, it cannot be said that they
are straws which show the direction of
the wind. The contest has not been lost
or won by any of the candidates. Up
to the present time there have been
only skirmishes, and they will be fol
lowed later by a general engagement.
Whatever advantage has accrued from
the earlier conventions Is possessed by
Senator Bard, and to just the extent of
that advantage ' his opponents are
handicapped.
Beginning with Riverside County,
which really began- the campaign and
removed the then existing doubt as to
whether Bard's name would go before
the Legislature, the other counties that
have declared themselves have an
nounced for him. Orange County was
hardly less emphatic In her declaration
for. Bard than was Riverside, and from
the two counties Bard can count upon
three votes, those of one Senator and
two Assemblymen. Following closely
upon the Orange Counl'y convention
came the primaries in Ventura County,
in which In a clear-cut test of strength
between Bard and Oxnard the county
declared for Bard. Meantime Kern
County had tacitly declared for Bard,
but Kern has been known to elect
Democratic Assernblymen-r-she now has
a Democratic Senator.
It is reasonable to suppose that Santa
Barbara County will follow Ventura,
and, going farther up the coast, San
Luis Obispo County probably will also
fall into line. There Assemblyman War
ren II. John is certain of renominatlon,
and he has declared himself for Bard,
and so has Tom Flint, who will he the
Senator from that new district.
In San Bernardino County General F.
C. Prescott is njot doing any talking.
He wants the Republican 'nomination
without having to make a fight for it,
and probably will get it. If he has any
preference in the Senatorial fight he
isn't telling anybody. If the county
convention instructs him he will vote
according to his instructions, like the
excellent soldier that he is. San Ber
nardino and Inyo counties form a Sen
atorial district, in which a Senator is
to be chosen to fill out the unexpired
term of the late Senator Hubbell, and
for this office there are several as
pirants. It makes not so much differ
ence who is successful as it does
whether the nominating convention ex
plicitly directs its nominee to vote for
this or that candidate, and in this dis
trict, as in others, the real fight Is over
the question/ of instructions, or no In
structions. The two votes here
mean. much in the way of determining
the final result, and in this district a
quiet but terribly earnest fight Is being
ate; and be it further
"Resolved, That we commend and In
dorse the economical administration of
Governor George C. Pardee." *
Delegates were selected to the State
and Congressional and joint Senatorial
conventions as follows: N. TV. Blanch
ard, H, K. Snow, D. W. Mott, R. M.
Clarke, R. ' P. Strathearn, C. H. Mc-
Kevitt, Joseph Hobart, F. &. Cook and
Orestes 'Orr.
While unlnstructed, the delegation is
known to be strongly favorable to the
candidacy of Smith of Kern for Con
gress.
The programme as arranged by the
Bard men, who outnumbered the Ox-
I nard followers In the convention by two
to one, was carried out as to organi
zation. C. C. Teague was made chair
man of the convention and Bert Deck
er secretary.
D. T. Perkins, Bard candidate, was
placed in nomination for the Assembly
by R. M. Clarke, who paid a high tri
bute to the aspirant and to Senator
Bard. The name of Major Drifflll was
placed before the convention by Hugh
Percy. Both the candidates received
applause in plenty at the mention of
their names, but before the handclap
ping had ceased Major Drifflll took the
! platform and asked that he be allowed
to withdraw hla name. Driffili made a
clever speech, saying it was his earnest
desire to promote anQ maintain har
mony in the party, and he asked that
all his friends get in behind Bard's can
1 didate, as he himself intended to do,
and aid in carrying the county for the
Republican party. Perld.ns . was then
nominated by acclamation.
The following resolutions were unan-
Imousfy adopted amid loud cheering:
"We, the representatives of the Re
publican party of Vjentura County,* in
convention assembled, do hereby ex
press our loyalty to the principles of
the Republican party as enunciated at
the last Republican National Conven
tion, and pledge our undivided and
united support to the nominees of that
convention; and be It resolved, that,
"Whereas^ The Hon. Thomas R. Bard
is an honored and respected pioneer
citizen of this county, has served his
State faithfully and well and submitted
to the people of this State the im
portant question as ta his return to the
United States Senate! and
"Whereas, The people of this county
have expressed their approval of his
career as United States Senator In no
uncertain terms, and have this day
nominated for the office of Assembly
man nls coworker, business associate
and friend, the Hon. D. T. Perkins;.*
"Now, therefore, Ventura County ex
presses its choice for United States Sen
ator in the person of Senator Thomas
R. Bard, and .with unfaltering* zeal and
loyalty to his Interests we commend
him to the Republican party and to the
people of our great State, and we here
by recommend to the delegates to be
chosen to the Thirty-third Senatorial
Convention that they use all honorable
means to secure the nomination of a
candidate favorable to the return of
Senator Bard to the United States Sen-
VENTURA, July 30.â Contrary- to ex
pectations in some circles, the Republi
can County Central Convention held
here to-day was a most harmonious
one. The candidate representing Sen
ator Bard in ttfe Assembly fight was
nominated by" Acclamation. He was in
dorsed for the nomination by Major
briffill, the defeated candidate, who
had stood at the late primaries for Hen
ry T. Oxnard. "- a; -

THE. REASON.â There is no medicine
equal to Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Dis-
covery, for purifying the blood. It carries
off the poisons which contaminate the life
fluid. It increases the activity of the
blood-making glands and gives the body
an increased supply of pure, body-building
blood. It builds up the body with sound,
healthy flesh instead of flabby fat, pro-
motes the appetite, feeds the nerves, and
so gives to weak, nervous people vitality
and vigor.
"About a year aco I. had a very bad congb

writes Hon. Geo. W. Lynch, of 17 Mason Street-
Worcester, Mass. "When a severe attack of
coughing would come on vomiting 1 would set in.
Matter accumulated in nose and my tonsils
were irritated. After reading of the wonderful
cures resulting from Dr. Pierce's Golden Med-

as to the good it would do me, I am frank to
say. But, after I had used one bottle I noticed
ouite a change for the better. Ordered five more
bottles and before I had used them all the cure
was complete. There is not now a trace of

perfect."

I tell you that a man can Â«taad a
whole lot of pain when it Is in an arm
or a leg or even in tha head, but when
a pain begins to locate about the heart,
it takes the nerve of a lion to fight
against it. I am a pioneerâ -I am not
a boy by any means, as my picture above
will show, and nyjst of Iny.life I have
been a mighty healthy manâ a doctor
bacKin Ohio about sixty ye^rs ago told
me that I was going to die Quite young
of heart disease. Poor doctor, he has
been dead many a year now, and here
I am. strong and well.
Sometime ago I was attacked by rhÂ»u-
matism. I did not pay .much attention
to it until it began to settle around nay
heart. It began to cut my breath short;
then I thought it about time to do some-
thing. I had little faith In any medical
treatment for such a trouble and fortu-
nately about this time I heard of thÂ»
Electro-Chemic treatment.
I went to the Electro-Chemlo Instl-*
tute. 118. Grant avenue, and the special-
ists promptly found out what ailed mÂ«>,
and I was so pleased with the thorough
mrfnner in which I was examined that
I at once began the Electro-Cheinlo
treatment.
I took the treatment Just cnÂ« month,
and in that short time, at a small ex-
pense, I. was thoroughly cured. Jly pain
is all gone, my rheunvittsrb is cared ai\d
I feel stronser and better in every way.

an auditor of the Southern Pacilic
Company was also put to work in an
effort to straiphten out litigation in
which the corporation recently became
involved in this city. The Interest
which Chief Engineer Hood of the
Southern Pacific Company has been
taking in the completion of the Clark
road is said to have also stirred up
much bitter feeling among those who
have been standing by J. Roes Chirk
and kindled the flame for dissension
that now threatens to bring about an
upheaval In Los Angeles. While Har
riman has a large interest in the road,
Senator Clark is its president and ap
parently purposes to brook no inter
ference from Harriman or any one else
la the management of the big project]
When a reporter attempted to inter
view the Senator on the reported trou
bles last evening hfe pleaded an engage
ment and hurried from the hotel.
SE.VATOR'S IRK AROUSED.
U is no longer a secret that E. II.
Harriman of the Southern Pacific
Cchnpany is exercising a wonderful in
fluence in the affairs of the new road
and, so ihe story goes, he has learned..
througb his own officials, that thÂ£
management of the road b/ J. Ross
Oark, during the .absence of Senator
Clark, has not been satisfactory to
those who are inclined to fully appre
ciate the interest Harriman has in the
corporation. Thope who opposed J.
Roes' Clark sided with Gjitbon and
a he? Senator Clark arrived in Los An*
geleÂ» it is said that he found a wide
breach existing between his brother
pugd his followers and Gibb'-n and his
followers. Naturally sympathizing
with his relative, Senator Clark jis said
to have openly declared at a confer
ence of the officials 'of the road that if
those who were opposed to J. Ross
Clark did Â£t>t imm -liately sue for
peace there w<juld be a number ot
changes and tne retort from those to
whom thir remark was apparently di
rected was: 'Go ahead and make
them.**
Having made a statement in New
York regarding his marriage and re
reat-d It in Butte City and later in
lÂ«os Angeles, the Se.-j.tor said last
night that he could not suggest any
further information concerning the af
fair and strongly intimated that he
sraa a bit ti^ed of discussing his fam
ily affairs through the press.
Following closely on the arrival of
the S' "jator here yesterday came a
story from Los Angeles to the effect
that a shake up among the depart
mental officials of the Salt Lake road,
of which he is president, is expected
very soon. According to the report
from the south, when Senator Clark
reached Los Angeles he four.d the of
ficials of the Salt Lake road greatly
disturbed over a conflict which had
been going on among them for sume
time. He promptly institute an in
vestigation, which quickly developed
â¢the fact that Second Vice President J.
Ross Clark, a brother of the senator,
and Third Vice President T. E. Gib
bon, were at loggerheads and thai-, sub
ordinate officers at the road were tak
ing sides with the two vice presidents.
HARRIMAX'S HAXD SHOW.V.
OFFICIALS ARE AT TAR.
United States Senator W. A. Clark
r>f Montana, who has been inspecting
Ilia railroad Interests in Southern Cali
fornia, arrived in this city last night
and Is staylns at the Palace HoteL
s'ince^ his last visit to San Francisco
the Senator's Becret marriage abroad
three years ago to bis young: .jvard has
been formally announced and provoked
much conuL^t. Apparently the fact
is not causing the copper magnate
ranch pc easiness, ccv he has beccnie ac
customed to seeing his name In prlntr
If his relatives and most Vntixnate
friends are correct in their statements,
he Is greatly relieved ever the final
publicity of the secret -which he and
his wife had successfully kei>t so long.
Senator dark. In explaining thS
secrecy of his marriage, saj A It "was
pimply part of a. pHn, in -which his vrife
acquiesced. In broer to permit her to
purs*, a her studies abroad without the
annoyance oi notoriety which natural
ly would have followed the announce
ment at an earlier date. Mrs. Clark
and her child are still abroad, but the
remits year will probably find her
back in New York, occupying the pala
tial residence of the Montana million
aire, which he has col pleted and fur
nished regardless of expense.

BERLIN, July 30. â The Cologne
Gazette to-day announced the forma

syndicate. It Is not known here what
countries participated, but It is as
sumed that Germany, Belgium, Great
Britain and the United States are in-
"Our object is to use our rights as
native born citizens of the United
States in assisting at* the primaries
and regular elections to choose such
officers as have a kindly feeling to
ward our race. We have a committee
"to ascertain the names and character
of nominees before the public; to In
form the Chinese voters as to the time
of the elections and to investigate the
platforms of the parties. Our Chinese
young men will be fired with new am
bition to be Jaw abiding patriots."
A ' mass meeting of Chinese native
sons was called at the hall of the Chi
nese Six Companies last night for the
purpose- of effecting a permanent po
litical organization. Several addresses
were made on the objects of the or
ganization, but the election of officers
was postponed to the next meeting.
Robert L. Park, president of the

cerning the object of the club Just

â¢Across the front of the Oregon build
ing is a banner bearing the words
"Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposi
tion, Portland, 1905," anÂ«l in the center
Is a shield bearing this: "Oregon 99
Years ago."
The Oregon State building is to be
presented to the city of St. Louis by
the State after this exposition and will
be used as a historic museum. It
stands In what will again &ecome part
of the city park after the fair is over.
Lewis and Clark made their headquar
ters a' Itttr miles above the post of St.
Louis on their journey to Oregon and
made that; place their headquarters for
a time on their return to the regions
nearer civilization. -All this makes the
Clatsop replica an appropriate struc
ture to stand in the chief pleasure re
sort of the great' city grown from the
post the explorers made their frontier
headquarters.
The central feature of this is an ex
pansivei dome constructed . of cereals
and grasses. In the Palace of Horti
culture the State' shows apples lhat vie
with' any and surpasses thÂ« majority
and cherries that are remarkable for
their size and quality.- Prunes of a
fine quality are also in the list of this
State's exhibits. Big .wheat and heavy
fleeces of wool are her especial pride.
Oregon boasts the youngest hostess
on the World's Fair groundsâ Miss Eth
el G. Wehrung. She. is the daughter of
W. H. Wehrung of Hlllsboro, who Is
special commissioner .and general su
perintendent .of exhibits here for the
State. The young lady Is said to ful
fill her duties with all the skill and
grace of mere mature hostesses on the
grounds.
Besides Mr. Wehrung, Oregon^ list
of chiefs here is as follows: :
FINE FRUIT EXHIBIT.
distributed. H. W. Goode, director gen
eral of thf Portland Exposition,: has
just returned after weeks*
study of this fair, and lie will use some
of the ideas gained to advantage.
Oregon uses her novel building as
one vetricle- for the display of her.
woods. The exterior the building is
just as Lewis and Clark knew.it, but
the interior is finished with a beauty
that would have made those hardy ex
plorers nervous. Simple, natural woods
âlarch, spruf e and firâ are used in this
finish, and the effect is very handsome.
Oregon's mighty 'forests and her lum
ber interests, her abundance . of fish
and game, are made known through an
elaborate display" in the Forestry, Fish
and Game building. Her exhibit in the
Palace of Agriculture is one of the
most noticeable there and well demon
strates the richness of her soil.
Oregon has a building at this exposi
tion that is one of the latter's most
noted features and is overlooked by few
visitors, but up to the present time the
State has not done much here toward
advertising her exposition, which
promises to be one of the finest ever
held In this country, though not as
large as some. The Oregon State build
ing here is a repllca^of historic old Fort
Clatsop, with stockade, lookout towers
and, mammoth chimney faithfully re
producedâthe fort in which Lewis and
Clark spent the'winter.in Oregon when
they made their historic exploring trip
under orders of President Jefferson and
gained for America that rich territory
where States are now blossoming Into
greatness, bustling cities are reaching
out for a share of the world's commerce
and an international exposition is pro
jected. It Is promised, though, that the
work of advertising the Portland Fair
will be taken up with a vim In St. Louis
soon and carried on to the end of the
Louisiana Purchase Exposition. One
book giving a good general idea of the
scope of the fair has been received at
the Oregon building here and is being
Ferdinand A. Haber, who is making
such a fine success in advertising the
California wine industry at the St.
', Louis fair, is one of the most enthu
siastic of the California representa
'Â¦ tives over the Lieges project. He sees
! groat possibilities in It. Speaking sev
eral languages and being well posted
on fruits and wines, Haber beewmes
well acquainted' with prominent peo
ple, among them the leading foreigners,
and thus learns a great deal of con
ditions at home and 'abroad that are
of value in his- work and consequently
so to the State. His idea regarding a
California exhibit at Lieges is per
haps too comprehensive to be prac
tical, but modified it would probarbly
meet general approval. He would have
the entire exhibit of California In the
Palace of Agriculture, and the other
buildings here, "transported to Lieges
and installed in one big California
building for Europe to admire and
draw enlightenment from. Other Cali
fornia representatives think a hand
some California building of moderate
size containing in the main a compre
hensive display -of the State's fruits
and wines would be sufficient.
Governor Pardee Is in favor of mak
ing a display at Lieges and has prom
ised his fullest support to the project.
He was approached by Haber and ask
ed what the chances of obtaining an
appropriation would be. Haber ..said
about $50,000 would be needed to maker
a creditable display.
"I; think it a line project," said the
Governor, "and if public sentiment Is
for it 1 will do all I can at the next ses
sion of the Legislature to aid it."
The extension of the market for Cali
fornia fruits and wines in Europe would
not.be the only object of a display at
Lieges. There are manjr expert viticul
turists and fruit growers in the Old
World who would perhaps be induced
to buy land In California and settle
there. Their skill and methods would
be valuable in enhancing the quality of
horticultural and vltlcultural products.

ING. "WORLD'S FAIR, July 30.â
Lieges, the second'^ity of Belgium, will
be the scene of kn iiliernational expo
sition beginning May; 1 next year and
lasting six months. Its chief features
will be displays of foodstuffs and viti
cultural products. Germany and Bel
gium are already using great quanti
ties of California dried fruits and
wines. This statement will be some
what surprising to the average Cali
forh^an, but it is quite true. California
has something more to do than pre
vent the Invasion of American markets 1 '
by foreign fruits and vintages. She
must extend her own markets in for
eign countries. At the same time It
wouldn't hurt the State to more gen
erally herald the fact that the foreign
countries that are her greatest rivals
in the American markets find some of
her fruits and wines better than their
own. It might reduce the value of
foreign labels.
Some of "ihe expert promoters here
who are representing California think
their State should make a large dis
play of fruits jind wines at the Lieges
expositionâ that great benefit would
accrue from any expenditure made. Of
course California intends to make a
fine display. at the Portland, Ore., ex
position, nor only from selfish motives,
but because she oweÂ£ this 'assistance
to her neighbor State, but this would
in no way interfere with a fruit and
wine exhibit at Lieges, though the
fairs run concurrently.

"T, have met the challenge with a
pdllcy none too vigorous for the out
lawry I wasf called to oppose. But
through it all I have had but one ob
ject, and that to show the people of
Colorado that the laws will be up
held â that a criminal organization
cannot dicta'te the policy or this ad
ministration and that everywhere
within the borders of Colorado prop
erty shall be secure and labor shall
be free."
Governor Peabody denies- ; the
charge that he is waging on la
bor unions generally and closes as fol
lows:
"I have had to deal with an organ
ization which has no counterpart in
this countryl Its official proclama
tions, full of defiance and challenge,
issued from time to time, have
amounted, as has been said, to a 'dec
laration of war.'
' DENVER, July SO. â Governor
James H. Peabody to-day Issued an
address explaining and vindicating his
acts in dealing with the labor troubles
in Colorado. He refutes the conten
tion that the strike inaugurated by the
Western Federation of Miners at the
ore reduction works in Colorado City
was called because of the failure of
the Legislature to enaqt an eight-hour
law, pointing: out that it was called on
the 14th of February, some flve or
six weeks before the adjournment of
the Legislature, which then had under
consideration an eight-hour law. Lat
er a sympathetic strike was declared
by the federation in Cripple Creek to
cut off the ore supply of the mills.
Governor Peabody then goes into
the history of the "Western Federation
of Miners, which, he declares, is re
plete with assaults, dynamite. outrages
and murders. In affbrdlng protection
to men who desired to labor, the Gov
ernor explains, "it- became necessary,
in my (judgment, to confine certain
men in military guardhouses, as one
of the safest and expeditious
methods of restoring order. It was
loudly proclaimed that this was with
out authority of law. The question
was submitted to the Supreme Court
and 'the action of the militia in that
respect fully sustained. It is a useful
and necessary power and the class
that should dread its exercise is not
numerous. The general policy pur
sued in Cripple Creek was followed in
other parts of the State, and particu
larly in Tellurlde, where the excesses
and crimes of the federation had been
still more inhuman than in any other
district and the rÂ«ign of terror still
more complete. Order now prevails
there." .
Quiet had been restored . in Cripple
Creek and the troops withdrawn when
the dynamite outrage was committed
at the Independence depot June 6, fol
lowed by the" riot at Victor. The* Gov
ernor â¢ places the responsibility for
both these occurrences on the feder
ation.
"When the excitement had some
what subsided and the county was still
under quasi-military rule," the Gov
ernor continues, "it was found that
I there were several hundred members
; of the Western Federation in the dis
trict yet wlio would not work and. had
resolve* that_ others should not if by
such methods as those employed at
the Independence station they .could
be driven away, I resolved that they
should be dispersed and I dispersed
them." ; * , .

William Behlow, Who I3 Sole Mem

ment to Creditors.
The furniture a.v' mattress firm
known as the Harder Company and
later as the Harder-Behlow Manu
facturing Company, at 807 Mission
street, yesterday morning closed its
doors to the public. Several months !
ago Harder withdrew from the firm,
the partners being unable to agree in
the manner cf conducting the busi
ness. Since then the factory has been
conducted by William Behlow.
The concern has been languishing
for some time and the withdrawal of
Harder, who is an experienced furni
ture and upholstery workman, fur- !
ther weakened the business. Behlow
was unable to bear the load and noti- j
fled his creditors, who are some of the '
principal furniture dealers of the city, i
The creditors held a meeting last
Tuesday and overhauled the books of
the firm. The investigation was only
preliminary and somewhat superficial.
It is thought that jJife business is not
Involved , more than S15.000 or $18,
000. though Mr. Beftitfw fevers that it
ii Â»ot over $10,000. Some of the cred
itors believe the firm will not be able
to settle at more than 25 cents on the
dollar.

complaint filed yesterday in the Su
perior* Court by her attorney, Maurice
L. Asher. The lawyer said last even
ing that he did not know whether the
defendant .in the suit, Oscar F. Hunt,
was in San Francisco. Hunt Is a
commercial traveler. In view of Judge
Kerrigan's action in calling the atten
tion of the Grand Jury to the Hum
meltenberg case of bigamy, the where
abouts of Hunt, if he is twice mar
ried, will be of interest.
Thej^unts'. second marriage took
place on March 23, 1903. A 5-year

mer marriage in 189 S. The attorney
for the wife declines to explain why
his client was twice married to Hunt
or^when or where the existence of his
marriage to another woman was dis
covered.
Mary E. Roche brought suit for di
â¢norce against William H. Roche on the
ground of desertion. She says that he

children. They were married on May

The trust company loans for the same
time have decreased more than $57,000,

cent or under, the rate of interest al
lowed on deposits by the. banks Is the
more unprofitable to the trust compa
nies. But it is known that the trust
companies have invited large deposits
for interior account during the last
year, which will be subject to recall to
meet the fall demands for funds In the
J interior, in common with similar depos
its with the banks. In the existing con
dition the bank3 will have to meet the
call on reserves, both on their own ac
count and on account of the trust com
panies. There 13 also the contingency
that with a rise In the call loan rate
I the trust companies may withdraw
their deposits with the banks to put

amount of Government expenditures
over receipts for this month rose at one
time more than compared
with less than $8,090,000 for the corre

ried the Government's working balance
decidedly below the traditional require

to figure a small profit for a short time
on gold exports. The rate of exchange
relaxed with the passing of the acute
crisis in the Anglo-Russian relations.

count of the loan subscribed here are
regarded, but it is the evidence afford
ed that there may be an obstacle to the
usual resort of this market to foreign
money markets for funds to move the

York bank reserves has some suffi
ciently analogous features to prevent it
entirely allaying apprehension over the
fall money situation, especially to the
minds of holders of stocks on margin

NEW YORK, July 30.â The â¢ Finan
cier says: The feature of the official
statement of the New York associated
banks last week was a further decrease
of $6,269,600 in cash, which was expect
ed from the traceable movements of
money during the week. Though this
increase was less by $1,248,200 than that
which was estimated, the discrepancy
may be accounted for In part by the
payment to the treasury on Friday of
52,800,000 through the banks on ac
count of Central Papiflc Railroad in
debtedness to the Government, ihis
payment making an average loss to the
banks of about $500,000. The general
deposits were Increased by $3,522,400
and the required reserve was thereby
augmented $S80,600 â deducting which
sum from the gain in cash as above
left $5,SS0,000 as the increase in surplus
reserve to $55,989,600, the highest since
July 2. 1S98, when the surplus was $62,
013,550. Computed upon the basis of
deposits less those of $23,353,700 public
funds the surplus now is $61,82S,025. It
is noteworthy that since May 22 this
year the cash item has Increased $69,
000,000 and deposits 104 2-5 millions.
The surplus reserve is higher by $43,~
162,350 than it was on May 14 last.

Offerings of commercial bills of ex

Some active speculative liquidation
has developed in this week's stock mar
ket, and iftj sharp reaction In prices re
sulted, in marked contrast with the
dull resistance to pressure which was
the feature of the market last week
and since the recent advance in prices
began to awaken susplc'^n and inti
mate further efforts to v-at up prices.
'The reaction was aggravated by some
of the happenings of the week in the
world of affairs, but it was inaugurated
before these became an influence and
began in th * face of some very favor
able news.
Railroad officials in their published
utterances on Monday showed a sud
den revulsion in sentiment from the
discouraged tone of the week before
and spoke in a very cheerful tone of
the short live * effect of the wheat crop
scare on traffic offerings and on busi
ness sentiment In their respective ter
ritories. The crop news of most of the
week has also been good. The sudden
bound in the exchange rate to the gold
export point was the most impressive
result to the apprehension of the New
York market. The rise in the London
money market, which was the immedi
ate cause of this, was only partly at
tributable to^the war scare. The Lon
don money0narket was considerably
involved in underwritings to new is
sues which proved hard to digest, and
as the relaxation of money there, ex
pected with the turn of the fiscal year,
failed to develop, the war scare came
on a weak money position. In our
market ther* had been sales of sterling
exchange in expectation of an early
outward movement in quantity of
grain and cotton, which was in effect
an outstanding short interest in ex

Nl^V YORK, July SO. â There was
practically no market for stocks to

determined the general tone. This
stock closed at the lowest of the day
at a net decline of "Â£. It may have
been influenced by the refusal of the
presiding Judge to allow a divideiid dis
tribution on Northern Securities pend
ing the decision^f the suit over the
distribution of assets; but the dom
inant position held L@ Union Pacific all
through the recent advance makes It
especially vulnerable to any reaction
ary tendency. The holiday in thi^Lon
don stock market, with another in
prospect for Monday, deprived Xew
York of its usual initiative from that
source, which is especially relied upon
just now on account of the politicaQsit
uation in Europe as a factor in the se

influence in causing Â©e extreme dull
ness of the da*, Unfavorable crop
weather in the rforthwest and another
strong advance in the price of wheat

TO WHOM IT MAT CONCERN: A year and
three months ago I was attacked wlta that
terrible disease, locomotor ataxla. Power to
balance, stand, or even sit down, entirely lost.
Two best doctors of San Francisco and Hot
Springs. Ark., failed to help roe. My stom-
ach, bowels and kidneys failed to work. I had
c "J**rh of stomach head and bladder aa a re-
sult of the disease; these troubles became
chronic. At times my heart would beat like a
drum, nay e y ea grew weak my memory bad,
my nerves wrecked. Three months ago I went
to Tuscan Springs. What happened ilncÂ» was
a pleasant surprise to me. Drank the waters,
took the bathsâ after thre* weeks' treatment
stomach, bowels, bladder and kidneys In per-
fect condition, eyealght perfect, nervousness
gone, memory good. After three months' treat,
ment, walked without a cane, with eyes closed i
*"<! Vp and down steep hills; am cured of this
d*ea<Â» disease, now walk with slight limp.
Have run stores In seventeen towns of the
Btate of California; am well known In down-

SOME time ago. when the Amateur Driving and Ath
letic Association of. this city asked the Park Com
missioners to proceed with the work of providing
an athletic field in Golden Gate Park, and the Commis
sioners refused, this paper upheld them-m their action.
While we realized fully what a splendid public feature
the proposed athletic field would be, and that there was a
strong temptation to the Commissioners tofcontract for
the work because of the large amount of money already
subscribed, the, only < wise "and Sjife course was the one
they pursued.'
The Amateur Driving and Athletic Association has
worked hard to # make up the deficit in the $50,000 re
quired, and has brought the total amount subscribed to
within $8854 of that figure. It has been sfow work, how
ever, and how, in accordance witlr a letter from the Park
Commissioners calling upon public" spirited citizens to
aid the enterprise and authorizing the^driving association
to act in the matter,-that body has issued a circular in
viting subscriptions.
The Park Commissioners have subscribed $25,000 upon
condition that the other $25,000 shall be made up by the
public. Of that amount $16,166 has been, obtained. from
about three hundred/citizens, leaving, as stated.'a balance

The assassination of Von Plehwe, Minister of the

bearing upon the destiny of the Czar's dominions than
any of the splendid victories which the Japanese have

Quecr Crankisms.
It transpired recently, during the
hearing of a case before one of the
metropolitan stipendiary magistrates,
that there Is a gentleman living -in
London to-day, a respectable and rep
utable citizen, who has a mania for
carrying on crusades against the po
lice.
He Is quite convinced In his own
mind, apparently, that the average
constable Is a brutal and cowardly
ruffian, and he is prepared to back up
his opinion by deeds and words.
Does any one complain of being as
saulted by a. "gentleman In blue," the
injured party has only to make his
case known to this modern Don QuI-
xote to insure his receiving both sym
pathy and assistance.
He has even published a pamphlet
bearing on the subject and has con
ducted cases against the police entire
ly on his own Initiative and at consid
erable expense and worry to himself.
It is not so very many years ago
since there died at Muswell Hill an
agred clergyman, whose mission in life
was to harry the tram and omnibus
companies.
He was incessantly at loggerheads
with them, regarding them as his
sworn foes and treating them as such.
Now It was that they covered the
v.indows of their vehicles with adver
tisements, thereby obstructing his
view. Then that they had no legal
right to demand to jee his ticket An
other time he would summon them for
exceeding the legal maximum of
ppeed.
He spent thousands of pounds in
litigation with them and had 'even
quite a crop of lawsuits pending when
death cut short a public career which
tru contention personified. Yet he
was said to have been a most kindly
and inoffensive man in private life.
There is a gentle little old lady who
is well known to most London stipen
diaries and whose fixefi idea it is that
the vast majority of cat owners are
monsters of cruelty.
Scarcely a week passes by but she
i-pplles for a summons against some
Innocent householder, whom she nn
agrfnea rhe has detected torturing one
or more of her feline friends.
Of course, none is granted. Time
v?as when sympathetic magistrates
v/ere wont to send officials of thÂ«
court to make inquiries as to the truth
of her alleffatlons.
But that time has long gone by. The
u?ual course is now to tell her that
the parties shall be warned; where-
The applications are sifted by Mrs.
Carnefrie and two or three are invfted
fÂ» meet her maid at a LOdon hotel,
tvften a final selection is made by the
maid in question, who invitss Hie
Â«'ok or housemaid, as the case may
be, to accompany her to Sk:bo. In
the case of men servants the selection
is left to Mr- Carnegie's secretary or
the butler if the secretary is too busily
engaged otherwise. All servants are
engaged on a week's trial only.
This is somewhat different to the
system prevailing in England, but the
Lord of Skibo believes that he can
t^ll in a week whether a servant is
likely to suit or not. It is very sel
dom thut he has to have reours* to
tl*e necessity of packing a servant oil
ai the end of the first week's service.
To encourage thrift in a good ser
vant he promises him or her a. boÂ»jus
at the end of every twelve months,
but he insists that the amount must
be invested in some substantial se
curity. Married men working in or
about "the castle are presented after
two years' service with an insurance
pclfcy guaranteeing their next of ki:i
the sum of no less than $500. They
are also insured against accidents.
Persons enjoving Mr. or Mrs. Car
negie's hospitality are exhorted not to
offer gratuities to any of their ser
vants.
A peculiar feature of the household
r.i.inagement is that a standard rate
of wages Is applied to the services of
overy man and woman employed
there. For instance, a cook's salary
at Skibo is so much for the first year,
and just so much more during the
second, even though the special in
< umbcr.t may be a veritable cordon
bleu. Moreover, Mr. Carnegie will
have nothing to do with servants' reg
istry office?. When a servant is Cant
ed he inserts an advertisement in one
of the fashionable London dailies in
viting application for a person holding
certain qualifications and stating
plainly the wages he is prepared to
give. The advertisement does not dis
vlose the name or the address of the
millionaire and it is usually worded as
follows: "Wanted, for a small family
living quietly in a castle in the North
of Scotland," etc.

GOLDEN RULE* JONES.
His Sad Regrets.
\ J. B. Southard, old-day miner In the
Western El Dorado, lawyer at the State
bar, preacher for a season, Judge on
the bench, but now gone over "Lethe's
wharf" into the sea that sweeps away
to an .unknown shore, once found time
hanging on his hands.
He accidentally met one afternoon a
long-lost friend and ex-partner from
the mines of an upper county. The
Judge had not seen Bill since they had
shoveled dirt into a flume together back
in the dim '50's. They dropped all else
and hugged each other in Oriental ft-r
vency. Then the hours flew with a
whiz. Not in the ordinary rush, but so
rapidly that the minutes and seconds
fell off the body of time and were lost
on the way. First at the Occidental
bar, where the Judge Â«was at home;
thence to Frank Garcia's, and after
ward to the Pacific Club â now out of
date. Then to the other resorts fre
quented by the bohemlans of the town
and the day. Without halting they
went over the route again, hurrying,
hurrying on through the night. No ac
count has been kept of the libations
that were poured out In that bacchana
lian feast. Bill had frequently turned
himself loose and made the golden
dust fly after the clean-up, but this
was faster than the best time of a min
ing town carouse.
Along toward morning Bill began to
break, and finally lost his feet. The
Judge carried him on around the
stretch till his condition called Impe
riously for a downy bed and the re
storerâsleep.
When the hack had rolled off for the
hotel with Bill the deserted and lonely
man stood looking sadly down the
street. The sun was flushing the sky
over the green Alameda hills and the
young day was finding its way through
the city streets. But time had left no
record of the passing night. To him
an hour was as a second and a cen
tury as a day.
"What shall I do," he soliloquized;
"what the thunder shall I do the rest
of the night?"
A Mother Song.
As my own mother used to comfort me â
Kissing the tears away â
Holding me close â aye. all too close for
sobs,
I hold thee, little dear one, close to

Calming my older pain, by stilling
thine â
As mothers only know â
My heart-break lost in thine, as hers In
mine â
Long ago, little dear one, long ago.
As thou in turn, a woman grown and
wise-
Shall kiss, as I kiss now.

Even thou. little dear one, even thou!

The Dole of the Alps.
The death roll in the Alps is increas
ing this year wtth terrible rapidity, and
promises to exceed that of any other
year of which reliable records have been
kept. There have been already thiÂ»
year no fewer than 160 deaths, either
from avalanches or climbing accidents,
in the Swiss and French Alps. Among
the most recent victims Is Bl Dubol3,
v;ho in making an ascent of great dif
ficulty and danger without a guide, ac
companied only by a friend, slipped and
fell and succumbed to shocking: inju
ries before he could be carried down to
the hospital. Mr. Rooke's death at Zer
matt appears also to have been due to
an attempted ascent of a difficult
passage without a guide. At Saentl3 a
German musical director fell and was
instantly killed a few days ago in the
Bodmer Alps. Two soldiers belonging
to an Alpine regiment were swept
away and killed a week ago near
Epierre. The accident on the Dolder
horn, due like so many others to the
absence of a guide, resulted in the
death of one of the three climbers and
such injuries to another that he will
probably never be able to walk again.
Another guldeless ascent on the Wetter
horn ended in the fall and Instant death
of one of a party of Swiss tourists.
While on Mont Pilatus an Englishman
exploring in thin summer shoes slipped
and fell, landing almost unhurt on the
very brink of a 200-fobt sheer drop.

days ago fell into a deep crevasse on

LOSING A DAY â A. B. L.. Santa
Cruz, Cal. In sailing westward a ship
loses a day in crossing the ISOth de
gree of longitude (that is the ISOth de
gree from Greenwich, near London). In
sailing eastward one day is added when
that degres is reached. For example,
if a vessel reaches that degree on Wed
nesday, while sailing eastward, that
day and the following day is set down
as Wednesday. But when a ship comes
to the same meridian on Wednesday
while sailing westward, Wednesday U
dropped and it is called Thursday. Thus
if two vessel meet at that meridian
sailing in opposite directions one ship's
crew has two Wednesdays in the week
while the other has none.
TWO men in the Middle AVest achieved the unusual
in the office of Mayor. One of these was Mr. Pin
grce of Detroit. He had many ideas closely bord
ering on Socialism. His first distinction , was reached
duringGthc last panic, when he promoted the devotion of
vacant lots in the city to the raising of potatoes and
other vegetables^by the indigent. 'The experiment was
a greater success in the press than < in practice, but it was
new, and its novelty gained fame for Mr. Pingree. who
was twice elected Governor of Michigan on the strength
of it.-
He was personally an honest man, but officially became
the dupe of designing politicians, and many corruptions
occurred which were expiated' in the penitentiary. Gov
ernor Pingree was so credulous and confiding that, he
attempted executive interference with the courts- to pre
vent the punishment of the men who had abused his con
fidence and despoiled the State. The net conclusion
upon his public career was that he was admirably adapted
for public responsibility in a community composed en
tirely of men like himself, but in our composite and com
plex society he was a failure.
-''The other candidate for fame was Golden Rule Jones,
Mayor of Toledo. Ohio. He proposed to make the
golden rule the guide of . all conduct, which it should
be, and, to the credit of mankind, is-mostly recognized
as the guide of conduct, followed sometimes at a dis
tance. It is not only among Christians. Confucius
stated it in one form and Buddha in another, but in both
to exactly the same meaning andfj purpose .as in our
Scriptures. Mr. Jones had ambitions in politics and was
a quite pronounced Socialist. He ran for Governor in
Ohio on his own. nomination and polled a very large
vote, but was beaten.
He was a rich man. made so by an invention which
occurred to him for the improvement of oil pumps while
working as a laborer in the oil. fields at Titusvillc. Pa.
He often expressed the opinion that no man could hon
estly acquire a million dollars, though he never doubted
that his own large fortune was the measure and maxi
mum of what a man could acquire without violating
the golden rule. That was -very human. When the
French Revolution began am aristocrat was the owner of
landed estates. Before it was over an aristocrat was a
man who wore trousers. So doubtless there are men a
few rounds lower on the ladder of fortune who believe
that no man could win Jones' fortune honestly and by
observance of the golden rule.
i He was the author of a great many epigrams, and de
lighted in their coinage. He took a strangely distorted
'â¢icw of things, which found expression in epigram. He
said: "Police courts arc charnel houses for the destruc
tion of , human souls. You' cannot coerce people Â¦ into
righteousness." This ignored, the duty of. the courts to
protect society against such as prey, upon it. Extend
ing the same idea, he said: "As long as the capital crime
of capital punishment . exists, there will be murder,", a
very shallow generalization, in which the death penalty
for murder is put forward as the only cause of a crime
that has its motive in a wide range of passions. If he
meant that there should be no criminal statute defining
as murder the killing of a human being, the depth of his
observation is not increased, because theQconscience of
man is a statute of murder recognizing it as a crime, a
malum in se, even in the absence of a human law mak
ing it a crime. Capital punishment is the highest form
of punishment, whether it be imprisonment for
the death penalty. 'Mr/ Jones did not. seem to be aware
of this and doubtless meant to<3,mpeacn the death pen
alty as the cause of murder instead of capital punish
ment, which may mean the death penalty or not.
His. singular blindness to the business operations of
a people appeared in his saying: "Borrowers of money
are life's real derelicts." The enterprise of a country is
kept going by energetic men who hitch their judgment
to borrowed capital. According to Mr. Jones a man
who borrows money is a social derelict, that iÂ»-to say.
a menace and a danger to society. No logic can justify
such a conclusion. One of the strongest inducements to
men- t<Pkeep their credit good is 'its use as capital in
their enterprises. If it be a social offense to. borrow
money the world must be content to a stopping of the
wheels of enterprise. ' The ability to lend money through
such trustees as the savings banks is one of the leading
inducements to thrift" among the wage workers, who own
the hundreds of millions of money on deposifwith such
trustees. men of enterprise who pay the- wages of
labor borrow this capital which belongs to the very people
they hire and invest it in enterprises which use more
labor, and pay more wages, enabling the earners to put
more money in the savings banks to be borrowed for
investments that furnish ' more ' employment for more
labor and pay more wages. _;:â¢ ;
' Personally Mr. Jones was a sociable and kindly man
who tried to live up to his conception of the golden
rule, but the faith, hope and charity in his philosophy
were distorted in refraction by an untrained mind.

Traffic on the Lakes.
The people of this country have thus
far scarcely realized the Importance
and magnitude of the traffic on the
chain of lakes. Cnly a short time ago
Detroit stood second as a port of entry
in the United *- :ates. and by tills time
she may possibly Stan-" flrrt, a3 -*ie
handles over 17 per cent of the exports
of the entire series of northern border
and lake ports. It has long been a
proud boast of the City of the Straits
that more than twice as much tonnage
passes through the Detroit River dur
ing the season of lake navigation as
through the Suez canal during the en
tire year. This is literally true. The
figures for 1902. for instance, as given
by the Blue Book of American Ship
ping, are 48.000,000 tons for the Detroit
River, as against 11,248,413 tons for the
international waterway. .
The summaries of the tonnaga pass
ing the Government locks at Sault Ste.
Marie afford the best indication of the
enormous growth of lake commerce, as
the greatest development of the grain
and iron ore trades has been through
ports at the head of Lake Superior.
These reports show that the freight
movement in 11)02 had reached the
enormous, total of 35,961.146 net tons,
against 11,214,333 tons in 1892, only ten
years previous, and against only 1,567,
74l tons in 1S31, the first year in which
the number of tons of freight was re
corded. Similar gains are shown In
the registered tonnage of vessels,
which amounted to 31.955.5S2 tons in
l<Â»02, as compared with 10,647,203 tons in
1892. In 1903 the totals were: Iron ore.

Tiger Shooting in India.
In the hot weather there is in most
parts tiger shooting, but it must be in
the torrid season, when the pools and
tanks are dried up, the jungles bare,
the soil so burning that the tiger lies
hidden, afraid for his soft feet, and
nigh to the only water. For this royal
sport trained elephants would be neces
sary and they are expensive animals to
keep. That is a sort of warfare again;
the mahouts spiking their brutes along,
with the beaters on either flank and
the tom-toms and fireworks in front;
and presently through the yellow grass,
striped just like himself with bars of
gold light and dark shadow, slinks the
murderer o-f the forest, whose time has
come to pay for the cows and Â¦women
and children he has killed. This is the
royal way.
I never knew a rajah who had our
patience to sit on the fork of a tree or
in a machan and wait all night over
the carcass of a buffalo or a goat for a
chance tiger. They like to have the
big game driven past a stand specially
constructed, and there are in India at
tached to the palaces many shikargahs,
or hunting, grounds, where this ar
rangement can be carried out as from
a screen in grouse driving. In old
times, and In some parts even to-day,
a pastime of a questionable kind was
derived by their highnesses out of the
jauwar-khana attached to many of
their palaces. This was the wild beast

defensible, and I think any person
would be justified '- removing such
dangerous hooks from the tops of low

But, perhaps, the queerest of all

But the companies decline to be
drawn. Not even when their adversary
changes his usual train so as to elude
the vigilance of the official whose duty
it is to see that he, at all events, among
their mOlions of passengers travels in
comfort, and then refuses to show his
ticket as a protest, will they take ac
tion. Perhaps they mentally recall the
case of Mr. Dobbs and his disputed
water rate.
How many people are aware that,
for over a quarter of a century, an
amiable faddist has been going about
the country with a hammer, driving
down projecting tenter-hooks which
have been affixed to^ences and palings
in such a fashion as to be dangerous to
children and others. Not many, it Is
to be presumed. Yet such is the fact.
Tears ago, it is said, cne of his own
little ones was badly lacerated about
the face by one of these sharp-pointed
hooks. It had been fixed, with a num
ber of others, to the top of a low fence
by a neighboring land owner, ob
ject being, of course, to keep out tres
passers.
No matter how crowded may be a
certain morning train into the city
from a certain .northern suburban sta
tion, there is^invariably one carriage
that contains no more than its proper
complement of passengers. Indeed, the
railway company has delegated an of
ficial to travel in the carriage In ques
tion for the express purpose of keeping
out intruders. And this it does, not in
the Interest", of its own directors, but
at the bidding of just an ordinary sea
son ticket holder who has had the
pluck to stand up for his rights.
The gentleman in question is well
known in the city, and his one ambition
is to force the railway companies into
testing in a court of law the burning
question of Oercrowding."
During that time he wrote thousands
of letters to the newspapers, printed
and distributed largely at his own ex
pense many tens of thousands of circu
lars and in the end succeeded in so edu
cating public opinion in the matter that
it is quite a rare thing nowadays to see
a respectable adult casting orange peel
about recklessly, as was the almost
universal custom a. couple of decades
ago.
The result of this spirited action is
that we all of us pay about one-third
less for our water than we otherwise
should have had to do, and the com
panies are so many millions of pounds
the poorer.
Or take again the case ,-nf the indi
vidual who, alone and single-handed,
carried on a crusade against the dan
gerous practice of throwing orange peel
on the pavements. He was but a poor
man and without influence or friends.
But he stuck to his point for over
twenty years.

forted.
Of course, pome of the crusades car
ried on by enthusiasts of this nature
result in the rectification of what are
real abuses. For instance, we were all
of us at one time, although we did not
know it. being robbedJ by thr; water
companies.
But there appeared upon the scene a
man named Dobbs, who' commenced a
crusade against them by tendering
payment for his water on the rated
value of his house and declininc lo
pay, as was then usual, on the gross
value.
He was promptly summoned, but,
nothing daunted, he carried the case
from court to court right up to the
House of Lords â and won.
neutral is part of its soil and cqu:.'!y inviolable.
Let belligerents employ their navies in j effectual
blockades and make prizes of neutral ships only when
they attempt to run the blockade and when within the
waters of -the blockaded country. That will" not be as
exciting or" profitable duty as playing pirate on the high
seas and sinking merchant ships, as Russia has done dur
ing the present war, but it will be work more becoming
and decent. The time is ripe for the agitation of this
subject. Great Britain and Germany have been hit a foul
blow by Russian piracy, under the mask of belligerent
rights, and the United States is threatened in the same
wfy. If the three should unite in an agreement that. on
the high seas free ships make free goods, and a neutral
flag protects everything over which it. flies, the other
powers would have to come into the fold, because the
United StatÂ£5> Great Britain and Germany are strong
enough to treat as a pirate nation any that would attempt
to violate a neutral flag on the high seas.
San Francisco is one of the great seaports of the
world. It must look out over the Pacific for its growth
and prosperity and commerce. It can well afford to take
the initiative in asking that the nations shall agree upon
the freedom of the high seas. ' Every seaport in the world
will join us and every merchant in the world will add his
influence. It is a great subject and now is the time to
agitate it.
It is not easy now to go back and re-create the condi
tions that v/ere once upon communication between coun
tries by letter. There were no international postal trea
ties, and a letter from one country getting into the postal
jurisdiction of another carried with it no obligation of
delivery and none to respect its seal and privacy. Now
the postal treaties, promoted by the United^States, enable
mail to be carried to the remotest corner of the earth as
safely as from one township to another in the same
county. A "registry stamp on a letter brings back a re
ceipt from any part of Europe, Asia or Africa*. Money
is sent everywhere by international postal orders, and in
its transmission and delivery is absolutely safe. The age
is distinguished by the high point reached by the nations
in these two respects, in which crime is repressed and in
tercourse safeguarded by mutual understanding, fortified
by treaties. ' . /
The arbitration treaties are the outgrowth of the suc
cessful experiments in extending the criminal jurisdic
tion of each nation overall nations, and the universal
safety and convenience of-^communication, which give
mankind a common postomce. The system of arbitra
tion which Great Britain is so satisfactorily extending
puts permanent treaties in the place of the temporary
protocols under which individual cases have been sub
mitted to arbitral .courts. Within a short time all of
the great nations will be joined in these permanent trea
ties and the risk ibf war will be greatly lessened. But
that risk cannot be entirely eliminated. There are issues
that cannot be arbitrated, and these V*jll arise and there
will be war, for ages will pass before the lion and the
lamb will be sale in the same pasture and before the
bear acquires the ox's appetite for straw.
But the sacrifices of war, when it comes, Qn be greatly
lessened by improving the opportunity of peace to make
international agreements that will insure the safety of all
mails and merchandise on the high seas. It is an.un
civilized thing that the property of the merchant and
ship owner, the promoters of the world's peace, who are
not responsible for any of the causes that lead to war,
but who push forward the prosperity of the people ,oj. all
nations, ra-ise life to a higher standard and increase its
comforts, Ts the first to suffer in war. The losses in
flicted are irreparable, and they are caused by permitting
to nations the piracy that is forbidden to individual*.
The nations should agree that only the flag of 'an enemy
can be struck on the high .seas, and that the deck of a
GREAT progress has been made in advancing the
common principles of justice between nations and
iiwacilitating the intercourse of the peoples of the
world. By the extension of extradition treaties there is
left hardly any refuge for a criminal. For offenses
against society and violations of law, a man may now be
pursued and delivered to the jurisdiction where he may
be punished; no matter in what nation he may seek to
hide.
This is a great advance over conditions a hundred
years ago, when men guilty of crime in one country could
escape punishment by-crossing its border into another.
Now all governments are practically combined in the en
forcement of the criminal statutes of each, and there is
no hiding place in the world for a criminal whence he
may not be dragged' to face justice and suffer punish
ment. This is the substantial union of human society to
prevent crime by making its punishment sure. The
United States has taken the lead in establishing this~sys
tem of extradition.

field in the world. It is to have a nest of tracks for
light harness horses, cyclists and foot racers, within in
ner oval for the use of all amateur sports. The outer or
speed track^will tie half a mile in circumference. In
stead of marring the view by unsightly grand stands the
spectators will view the events from an inclined green
sward extending around the oval. A perfect view will
thus be afforded to the features in the different tracks.
Participants in the'various games will reach their respec
tive tracks by tunnels, and will have everything required
for their comfort and convenience.
In such, a splendid public improvement as this, where
all classes of athletes will reap a benefit, it is not fair to
permit the whole burden of raising the necessary funds
to be upon one organization. The Commissioners have
been liberal in setting aside half of the required cost, and
the comparatively small amount now needed should be
immediately obtained by those interested in sports and
athletics and the public generally. The Park Athletic
Arena would then be a reality. It would be a permanent
and beautiful improvement to add to the fame of our al

equity interest In an old note for
$59,000 is given as the basis for ap
plication of Samuel Shear for letters
of administration, upon the estate of
Dolores L. Green, who died January
1. 1898. The petitioner states that the
deceased was interested in a mortgage
executed by William C. Jones in New
York in 1884 to Alfred A. Green for
$Â£9,000. Green assigned the mortgage
to his wife and she in turn assigned it
tc*. one Thomas P. H. .Whitelaw on
March 16, 1888, with the understand
ing that he was to proceed with a fore
closure. Whitelaw was to receive one
tliird of the proceeds, but he never
foreclosed, and the purpose of the ad
ministration is to find out if any part
of the sum can be recovered. Shear,
the petitioner, is the husband of one
of the heirs.

General Adna R. .Chaffee, chief of
staff. United States army, accom
panied by General Charles 1$) Humph
rey, made a tour of inspection of the
Presidio yesterday. He was accom
panied by General MacArthur, Colonel
S. P. Jocelyn, Major C. A. Devol, Ma
jor Parker W. West and Colonel W. S.
Patten. General Chaffee's visit was
entirely devoted to looking over the
post to see what it actually needed in
the way of improvements. There was
no review, no salute, no inspection of
the troops. Everv department of the
post was inspectecl.-including the main
barracks, cantonments, warehouses
and both hospitals, and General Chaf
fee now has a full understanding of
the needs of the Presidio.
So far as the cantonmenial are con
cerned the head of the army made a
special and complete investigation.
Whether he recommend an ap->
propriation for entirely new barÂ®icks
or whether he will decide that the
present quarters of the cantonment
camps are sufficient remains to be
seen. General Humphrey was .decid
edly of the opinion that the Presidio
was greatlj in need of improvements.
On entering the Presidio General
Chaffee: was received by Colonel (Wil
liam L. Pitcher, surrounded by all the
officers of the Twenty-eighth Infantry,
in the little shack that serves as head
quarters for that cantonment. They
could barely squeeze in there and Col
onel Pitcher took advantage of the
occasion to call attention to the needs
of an administration building. A com
plete survey of this cantonment was
then made, after which an informal
reception was held in Colonel Pitch
er's q-Q.rters, during which the band
played "Hail to the Chief."
General Chaffee and party were
next driven through the post prQjer.
Luncheon was served at the quarters
of Colonel Morris and was attended
by all the oflicers of the ; pi>st. Mrs.
Morris and the Misses Morris weiÂ©
also present. The warehouses on the
beach were then inspected and the
party drove out to the big guns. After
inspecting these the pO/'ty went di
rectly to the ferry building, where
General MacArthur said good-by to
the chief, who was escorted across the
bay by Colonel Jocelyn and Major
West. At 4 o'clock he boarded his
private car, as he had a great volume
of work to do, and at S o'clock he was
traveling swiftly northward to Port
land. It was reported that General
Chaffee was greatly impressed with
the need for many improvements in
this department. If this is true his
opinions' coincide with those of all the
troops Qliat have been statioiQd here.
The trialQof Lieutenant Charles P.
Smith will be resumed at 10 o'clock
to-morrow morning at the Presidio,
where he will face two additional
charges â absent without leave and
disobedience to orders. It is under
stood that some important testimony
ojf^ a sensational character will be
brought forward by the defense.
General MacArthur, accompanied
by Major Parker W. West, will leave
Monday afternoon for Ord barracks
to witness the finals of the target
practice. The medals will be person
ally presented to the fortunate con
testants by General MacArthur on
Wednesday 'morning. General Mac-
Arthur will return to town the same
evening. v
Colonel Pitcher is busily engaged
drilling the provisional regiment that
is to go to Atascadero, where it will
take part 'in the maneuvers. Yester
day they had a big field practice,
which covered the grounds of the. golf
links and reached out beyondQ the
Marine Hospital. Colonel Pitcher ex
pects to ' have the regiment in fine
shape for the maneuvers.
The transport Sherman, which
sailed from this port on July 1 for
Manila, arrived at Guam on July 27.
The transport Logan will sail to-mor
row for Manila with a fi^l comple
ment of casuals and several hundred
recruits.
The trial of CaDtain Frank A. Cook,
who is accused of drunkenness. In this
city some time ago while en route to
Manila, will be brought before court
martial at the Presidio, which will
probably convene early next week.
The following officers registered at
headquarters yesterday: Major Gaines
Lawson, who is staying at the Occi
dental; Major Mason Jackson, 900
Sutter street: Lieutenant Charles Van
Way, Twelfth Cavalry; Lieutenant H.
G. Sharpe of the Twentieth Infantry,

Auditor Baehr yesterday decided not
to audit the salary demands of Paul
Bellemans, E. T. Darbey, A. A. Oliver,
William Ross and S. M. Sullivan, extra
deputies in Recorder Godchaux's ofnee.
Baehr's action is guided by the fact
that the Mayor has not recommended
the creation of the positions as being
necessary, as the charter provides
shall be done in all cases where extra
deputies are employed. i./Â»'.. : â¢
Twenty-five Deputy Registrars,

till to-morrow, when he may file a
complaint charging the larceny of 52000
instead of 55000. At the time of Young's
arrest the police wanted to charge him
with obtaining money under false pre
tenses, but a private attorney got the
warrant issued for embezzlement and
subsequently an accusation of grand
larceny was added. Young operated a
bookmaklng and diamond contract
scheme in the Starr-King building and
the police say he had cleared about
550,000 from various victims when he
suddenly left the city. Mrs. Johnson
paid 5-100 to have him arrested in New
York and brought back here.
"I never was arrested for any offense,
and am guiltless of the one I am here
accused of."
Bailiff Mahony then reminded Smith
that several ' months ago he was
charged with having stolen a gripsack
and was sentenced for petty larceny by
Judge Mogan.
"Heavens!" exclaUned Smith melo
dramatically. "Am I to be forever per

pay for an able defense he replied in
pretty good. English:
"Sure. You get me out and I'll give

_W. M. Mills and W. Dow were Jointly
charged with having broken a show
window on Grant avenue and neither
of them could enlighten Judge Cab
aniss as to how the damage was ef
fected. Mills said that he did not de
sire to relieve himself of any blame
that Justly attached to him, but at the
same time he considered it his duty to
himself to inform the court that If he
fell against the window, as alleged by
the policeman, he must have been
either dragged or pushed, because he
was exceptionally free from iconoclas
tic Instinct and would never of his own
volition, however drunk he might be,
attempt to damage property. Dow
pleaded similarly in his own behalf and
then the Judge dismissed the case and
ordered the defendants to defray tho
cost of repairing the shattered -window.
For beating his. wife Frank Bandry
was given ninety days' imprisonment
by Judge Conlan.
A. Jury In Judge Fritz's court ac
quitted C. L. Murphy, a striking stable
man, of the charge of having hurled a
rock at a hack driver who was con
veying a party from the recent FVench
ball at Mechanics' Pavilion. The pros
ecuting testimony conflicted, Patrol
man Goff swearing that Murphy threw
the rock and Corporal BIrdsall testify
ing that it was cast by one of the de
fendant's companions.
When the case of James F. Young,
Frank . Smith, accused of stealing
fishplates from a railway yard, was
given thirty days' imprisonment by
Judge Cabaniss.
"Have you ever been charged with
larceny before?" asked the .Vudgewhen
Smith was placed before him.
"No, sir," was the emphatic answer;
Convicted of stealing a dress suit case
from a room of the hotel In which he
was employed as a bell boy, George
Simmons pleaded so hard for mercy
that Judge Fritz postponed sentence for
three months and allowed him to go on
his own recognizance, at the same time
suggesting It would be well for him to
shun temptation by going to sea. That
happened three months ago, and yes
terday Master Simmons stood before
the Judge and reported that since his
previous appearance In court he had
been leading an honest life.
"What are you doing for a living?"
his Honor inquired.
"I am employed An a hotel," was the
reply.
"Well, I don't think you are a safe
person- to be employed in a hotel," said
the Judge. "The testimony proved you
of larcenous inclination and unfit to be
trusted where there is , temptation to
steal without fear of arrest. That was
why I advised you to go to sea, where
there Is not much chance of getting
away with portable property without
danger of detection. I now .repeat that
advice, 1 and failure to adopt it will
mean your imprisonment for the full
term prescribed for your offense."
Master Simmons promised to seek a
Ehlp right away.
Mrs. Sarah Curtis, accused of (tending
obscene letters to Mrs. Emma Fitzger
ald of 110 Minna street, disclaimed au
thorship of the unprintable missives
and requested Judge Conlan to have
chlrographlc experts appointed to com
pare her handwriting with that alleged
to be hers by Mrs. Fitzgerald. His
Honor took the request under consid
eration till to-morrow.
John Nelson, descendant of the Vi
kings, dropped Into a gospel meeting
at Pine and Kearny streets last Friday
evening and made his presence so of
fensive that a self-appointed commit
tee of two muscular worshipers ejected
him from the hall. Then he stood upon
the sidewalk and exhorted until Patrol
man J. B. O'Connor undertook to si
lence him, when a scrimmage and the
Inevitable arrest ensued.
In Judge Cabaniss' court the plea of
inebriety was advanced by Mr. Nelson.
"Ay ban dronk," he said, "an* ay sor
ray. Ay gode Christian when ay ban
sober." Then he went on to explain
that it was not the doctrine expounded
In the meeting that had provoked him
to disorder, but the promptings of evil
that dwell within the flowing bowl. His
confession 'of faith was rewarded with
twenty-four hours' imprisonment.
.Mrs. Ellen O'Donnell of. 115 Jackson
street told Judge Conlan that for gen
eral worthlessness she would back'her
husband, James, against anything that
ever assumed to be a man. Laziness
and love of drink were his principal de
merits and when drunk he would beat
her if she were fool enough to permit
him. She hoped the court would deal
with him unsparingly, as she could get
along better without him than by hav
ing him constantly pestering her. If
the lady's mind does not undergo a
radical change before next Friday her
appeal may find satisfactory response.

Judge Cabaniss gave Albert Paodl
until September 1 to remove his ward
robe and other personal belongings
fr*om his wife's apartments on lower
Green street, the lady having stated
that she very much preferred his ab
sence to his society.
"He's my second husband," she said,
"and he'll never have a successor. Of
all the good-for-nothing creatures I
ever beard of. he is the worst. He re
fuses to work, and when I refuse to
work he beats me. All that I ask your
Honor to do Is to make him take nis
clothes and go."
"It gives me pleasure to accede to
your request, . madame," said the
Judge, "and 'I hope, for '-.your own sake,
you will llve'up to your resolve to keep
his former "place Â¦ at table forever va
cant." .

Judge Fritz finsd them 55 apiece and
Informed them that the sentence would
be heavier if they had not missed one
of the best prizefights he had ever
witnessed.
Among the admiring compatriots of
"Battling" Nelson who did not witness
the defeat of Eddie Hanlqn, on Friday
night were William Altemln and Fred
Ahokas, bolh enrolled "a. b." on tho
books of the coasting schooner Fearless
Flossie. That they missed seeing the
fistic glory of Denmark upheld was
entirely the fault of the two seamen,
for thejThad the pecuniary means, the
time and, it is needless to say, the in
clination to visit Woodward's Pavilion,
when they were arrested for fighting
and forced to spend the memorable
night in prison.
After obtaining leave of absence from
their ship Mr. Altemin and Mr. Ahokas
â mispronounced "Artichokes" by the
clerk of Judge Fritz's courtâ started
for the ringside and while awaiting a
street car they unfortunately, dropped
into a Steuart-street saloon, where the
relative prowess of ! "Battling" and
"Eddie" were under discussion by a
group of 'longshore characters whom
Impecuniosity alone prevented seeing
the mighty little boxers In action. Into
the argument indiscreetly plunged the
flower of the Fearless Flossie's, crew.
Mr. Altemin's opinion that Nelson
would win In a canter, was enthusias
tically indorsed by Mr.; Ahokas, while
the Hanlon partisans as firmly ex
pressed belief that their favorite could
not be beaten by any one of his weight
in this or any other country. The
longer the debate waged the more beer
was consumedâ the two seamen paying
for all of itâ and Just how the fight be
gan nobody concerned seemed clearly
to recollect. . When the policeman ar
rived on the scene he found pnly Mr.
Altemin and Mr! Ahokas. They were
locked in close embrace and kicking
and biting most viciously and when
they were pulled asunder each was
surprised to find that the other was
not somebody else. -

H. Heller was brought from Los An

Wren and booked at the City Prison on
a charge of passing a fictitious check.
The check was ' for $27 50 and was
passed on Mlersch & Claus of the Em
porium bakery, at Â«Ellis and Leaven
worth streets. Heller was introduced
to the firm by A. Silverstein, who had
5900 taken from his pocketbook" at a
hotel on Ellis street about two weeks
ago on the eve of his departure for Eu
rope. It Is also alleged that Heller
passed a fictitious check on R. D. Davis
& Co., at 46 Geary street.
Heller had another scheme which
may bring him into more serious trou
ble. It is alleged that he has been sell-
Ing barrels of whisky in bond In Louis
ville, Ky., to retail dealers in this city
and other places on certificates which
were fraudulent. He was arrested in
Los Angeles for a job of this kind, but
owing to the refusal of the person in
New York .whose name was alleged to
have been forged on the certificate to
go there and testify no action was
taken against Heller.
One of his victims here is Eugene
McCoy of McCoy & Nesbltt. He wrote
Chief Wlttman from Adams' Springs
that he had purchased fifteen barrels
of whisky from Heller which were said
to be in bond in Louisville, and when
he wrote to the proprietors of the bond
he received a reply that they knew
nothing of Heller or the firm in New
York he claimed to represent. Heller
had received money on the sale.
Another letter was received by the
Chief from a representative of Braun
schweiger & Co. that A. T. Dormia and
Marra â¢& Mozettl of 'Reno, Nev., had
both been victimized by Heller In the
same way. Each had purchased five
barrels of whisky In bond and had ad
vanced 525 to Heller, but found there
was no whisky for them. The police
believe that others will be heard from.

On motion of Assistant District At
torney Ferral, John Dougherty was
discharged from custody by Judge
Lawlor yesterday. Dougherty was em
ployed by L. Bercovich of Oakland and
on January 1 5 sold a quantity of sacks
to P. A. McDonald, coal dealer of this
city, for $78 75 and appropriated the
money. He appealed to the Supreme
Court and was granted a new trial on
the ground that the elements of crime
were lacking. The prosecution had no
further evidence to offer and moved
for a dismissal.

fifteen minutes of that cat's nina lives

It has been stalked by the youthful
feline head hunters night and day. It3
nine-fold vigilance ia unceasing and
its nerves are set on a hair trigger. Tha
wreck of one ear and the loss of half
of its tail tell of narrow escapes in the
past. It Is said the doctor wants that
cat and the price he has put upon it
is beyond the dream of a Hayes Val
ley boy's avarice.
The women go further and complair
of the manner of the disposal of the
bodies after the arterial circulation ol

Casper Kubli, proprietor of the gro
cery at -3695 Sacramento street, is a
man of business and his testi
mony yesterday before the Coroner's
jury showed that death has no ter
rors for him when somebody wants to
buy a loaf of bread. It was he who
found the dead body of Ernest R.
Williams, his clerk, with the gas
turned on last Friday morning. His
testimony was that he did not turn off
the gas because a customer came to
the store to buy a loaf of bread and
Kubli went out to wait upon him.
He admitted that he did not know
whether or not Williams was dead or
only unconscious, and on being asked
by the Coroner why he had not shut
off the flow of gas replied that he
would have done so had he not been
obliged to return to the store to sell
the customer a loaf of bread.
* A verdict of. suicide was rendered.

Judge Dunne has taken another week
to reach a conclusion in regard to the
case of George T. Ballinger, charged
with felony embezzlement on complaint
of William Schroeder. president of the
California Art Glass Works. The case
is on the Judge's calendar for trial, but
Ballinger has been discharged by Judge
Graham on a writ of " habeas corpus.
Attorneys Barry and Barrett for the
defendant submitted a motion two
weeks ago for the dismissal of the in
formatloti Mo Judge Dunne, but he
seems determined not to grant it if pos
sible.
The point at Issue is whether or not
the writ of habeas corpus was applied
for prior to the filing of the informa
tion, both having been done on the same
day. At the pfevious calling of the case
Deputy County Clerks Doran and Wells
testified that the application for the
writ was made in the morning and the
information was filed in the afternoon.
Yesterday Louis Ferrari, assistant in
the District Attorney's office, testified
that he was in the habit of filing infor
mations in the morning, but sometimes
he did it in the afternoon. He had no
independent recollection of the Bal
linger information.
The defendant's attorneys objected
to Ferrari's testimony, and the Judge
te'stily said that*he desireo" to find out
the whole course of the proceeding.
"I have carefully gone through the
records," said the Judge, "and I am
satisfied that a public .offense has been
committed. You can object to the
whole proceedings if you like, but I am
going to Instruct the District Attorney
to proceed and do his duty."
There was no further evidence to of
fer and the Judge continued the matter
for a week.
Mrs. Lawrence, who lives on .Post
street, not far from th* doctor's al
leged laboratory, says the lads of the
valley are rapidly achieving wealth
through his liberality. They put In all
the time out of school, legitimate or by
"hooky," picking up Saturday Chutes
money in the doctor's employ. The
schedule of prices runs thus: Able
bodied adult cats, full blooded and full
of war, 50 cents apiece; medium size,
or with the thinness of fasting, 3u
centsV primary kits. 25 cents. Silken
coated Angoras with pedigrees reach
ing back to the days when Persia shiv
ered her spears against the phalanxes
of Alexander are valued at 73 cents and
two green trading stamps.
There is one solitary cat In the local
ity, Mrs. Lawrence avers, and overj
It is only fair to Dr. Tait to credit
him here with a denial positive and
absolute. He-intimates that the func
tions of a cat's nervous system,
whether sensory, motor or reflex
nerve action, is not a subject of ex
perimental investigation with him. But
the housewives in Hayes Valley find
that the mousers are disappearing in
a mysterious way; domai rodents bold
ly invade the pantry and the tender
melodies of Tom's serenade are heard
no more.
Cats are shy In Hayes Valley â shy
in numbers, shy in disposition. Only
an occasional kitty, hurried and fear
some, prowls through the sunlit alley
ways. The midnight meow and cater
waul sound pianissimo from the back
fences of Western Sutter street. The
golden canary can hop from his cage
with neither Tom nor Tabby there to
stalk him along the soft carpet, and
the mouse, grown overbold, plays to a
circuit of catless houses.
This unusual state of affairs, accord
ing to the Hayes Valley ladles who
once owned blue-coated Maltoses and.
blue-blooded Angoras, Is because Dr.
Dudley. Tait has used up the surplus
felines in the Interest of science. Vivi
section, with a big V, they call the
doctor's crusade against their house
hold pets. They fail to allege in their
complaint whether his research into
the circulation of the departed pussies
was along the line of physiological or
pathological in\estlgatlon, but in the
statement they voice their objection
to his increasing an already obese fund
of scientific knowledge at their ex
pense. They are opposed to his contin
uing the experiments of Galen and
Harvey through the blood channels of
cat systems. The doctor moves on in
his cold, scientific way, hence their
tears.

a proper showing were made at that
time.

till August 8.
Attorney Grady said he had received
a letter from the United States Consul
General in Paris, France, asking for
the fees for taking the testimony of
Mrs. Colt. He requested the Judge to
make an order on the City Treasurer
for the Consul's fees, but the Judge de
clined, as it was outside of Ms juris
diction. Grady demurred, saying it was
hard tfiat a man charged with murder
and penniless should be compelled to
pay $50 for procuring testimony, but he
promised to send the money and asked
for a continuance till September 1.

The children had been the greatest
sufferers 'and their . pleading for "a

to the pangs of their grown-up ship
mates.
The fifteen passengers were trans
ferred to the Curacao and tenderly
cared for. Two days later, when the
steamship reached Ensenada, where
the fifteen were landed, most of them
had recovered from the effects of their
experience on the Kitty.
From the steamship's stores Captain
Paulsen replenished the larder and
wafer tanks of the Kitty, which was
left in charge of the crew to await the
belated breeze. . â¢
Captain Paulsen of the steamship
Curacao, which arrived yesterday from
Guaymas, on the outward voyage saved
a score of people, six of them chll
dre, from a lingering death in a wind
abandoned schooner off the coast of
Lower California.
/ Two days before the Curacao reach
ed Ensenada the schooner Kitty was
sighted near Geronimo Island, be
calmed and flying signals of distress.
One of the Curacao's officers boarded
the sailing vessel and found there a
distressing state of affairs.
. On board the Kitty, in addition to
the crew, were fifteen passengers, in
cluding J. Smith, wife and six chil
dren and several Mexican men and wo
men. The Kitty was from San Diego
and bound for Lower California.
She had been becalmed for eighteen
days where the Curacao found her.
The food supply was exhausted, the
last drop of water had been consumed
and death in one of its most dreadful
forms seemed inevitable when the
white hull of the Curacao loomed up
over the horizon.

port to the Congress on the first day of

but Is conducting this investigation
entirely open-minded. It looks for
ward to important results from its
visit to your city.
""Realizing the great Importance of

spectfully request that you' will ap
pear before .them and present such
subjects as you deem pertinent to the
occasion."
In addition to this It is especially
requested that all who intend to be
present at the meetings of the com
mission to take part in the proceedings
shall notify Secretary E. Scott of such
intention as soon as possible.
Before coming to this city the Mer
chant Marine Commission has visited
Tacoma, Seattle and Portland on this
coast and suggestions have been re
ceived at each of these places. Yes
terday the commission was at Port
land. In addition to those enumerated
in the list of persons and firms who
had been Invited, up to last night, to
appear before the commission In this
city other men prominent In commer
cial life may be present.
Secretary Marvin wrote to President
Kewhall of the San Francisco Chamber
cf Commerce, in part, as follows:
"It Is assumed that two days will
probably be required to hear the im
portant maritime Interests at the
Chamber of Commerce and that
August 4 and 5 will be the days for
the business cession. At Seattle, as
elsewhere, the commission has heard
considerable testimony that is simply
history. What Is especially desired ia
epeciflc suggestions from practical men
ts to the best methods by which the
American merchant marine In over
seas trade may be re-established. The
commission desires to hear not only
the representatives of your great
steamship companies, but also the rep
resentatives of sailing ship interests,
so powerful still on the Pacific Coast.
Representatives of the sailors and fire
men and other seafaring men and also
of workmen in the shipbuilding yards
Â¦will be welcomed most cordially. It
will be rendering a great favoT to the
commission if you can invite to the
hearing all those who, in your opinion,
are agreeable to give intelligent, prac
tical counsel and give it in brief and
business-like form."
During the past week conferences
have been taking place In this city be
tween representative transportation
and business men In which the basis
of discussion was the opening up of
the Panama Railway to all sea car
riers. For many years freights have
been diverted from the sea and com
pelled to use transcontinental railways
as much as possible and this condition
fitlll exists and bids fair to exist in
definitely unless the Panama Railway
in the immediate future and the Pan
ama canal upon Its completion are
thrown open on even terms to all car
riers of freight by, eer. A live issue of
greatest importance Is therefore on
hand in the near expiration of the con
tract between the Panama Railway and
the Pacific Mail Steamship Company.
The advantages that may be conferred
upon all shipping by gi-*-rr it a fair
chance to carry freights which are now
The Panama Railway's contract*
with steamship companies, and notably
the one with the Pa 1c Mail Steam
ehip Company, may figure largely.. In
the testimony that is given in this city
during the present week when the
Merchant Marine Commission, com
posed of United States Senators and
Representatives In Congress, begins to
hear from representative citizens how
the American merchant marine in over
seas trade may be re-established.
The commission will . arrive in San
Francisco by the Shasta route at 9
o'clock cert Wednesday morning. The

of things occult who imparted the

yesterday has acquired an enviable rep

her wonderful prognostications during

much comment. It was while reading
Mrs. Jeffries' fortune from the paste

PLEASANTON, July 30.â The initial
meet of the California circuit wound up
here to-day with one of the prettiest
races that was ever run on the track.
In the seventh heat of the 2:23 class
J. D. Springer's Miss Idaho took first
coin from Cavallero and Tom CarneaL
the latter handled by old Dad Trefry.
The mare was favorite in the first heat,
but did not show. Carneal and Cava
liero copped two heats apiece.
In the fifth Idaho got into the going
with air feet. She took the sixth by a
nose from Cavaliero Just as the last
train whistled at the depot. You could
not drive any one from the track with
a regiment of Cossacks. The natives
went wild as Springer, who- piloted his
own animal, is well liked here. Cava
liero and Tom Carneal were badly

away from them in the stretch. This
makes two purses Springer has an

first day's pacing race.
A sight to stir the blood of lovers of
harness races was an exhibition quar
ter-mile by that grand old horse Fly
ing Jib. Though 16 years old, the ven
erable idol of other days made his dis
tance in 30 J /i seconds. He is still a few
lengths ahead of old age. The side show
almost brought tears to the eyes 6f
those who knew him in his prims.
Silva & Wright's Kelly Briggs. a Sac
ramento animal, drew away from
everything in the 2:10 pacing race. Una
K, by McKinney, surprised the wise
ones. Telephone, which started favor
ite, was distanced in the first heat. Una
K took three straight heats, though she
just lasted out in the third heat, break
ing as she came under the wire.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
Nelson is ready for another bout and
is not averse to taking on Brltt if the
latter's match with Corbett falls
through.
Hanlon is undecided as to his move
ments. Billy Delaney wants him to
spend a couple of weeks at Harbin
Springs. Some of Hanlon's friends are
advising him to quit the ring for a'
year, devoting the time to developing
his hitting powers. Hanlon is the
ycungest boxer in the ring and can
afford to rest up without being in any
immediate danger of being overtaken
by Father Time.
Battling Nelson and Eddie Hanlon
were about town yesterday, showing no
bad effects of their sensational fight
of the night before. Nelson was un
marked save a slight abrasion on the
wrist, for which he is unable to ac
count. Hanlon was slightly marked
about the face, but a few days will
heal his wounds.
The fight drew a larger attendance
than was expected at this time of the
year. The total receipts were $8244.
Of this the Hayes Valley Club took
half, or $4122. Nelson received $2473,
while Hanlon'a share was $1649.
Referee Billy Roche said yesterday
that had Hanlon been on his feet at the
end of the twentieth round he would
have given him the decision, as he had
too great a lead to be overcome by
Nelson in the last four rounds.
Hanlon says he was in a bad way
after the blow in the eighteenth, which
was aggravated by the fall he received
on the hard floor of the ring, which
was not heavily padded. He still
thinks, however, that had he been al
lowed to go on Nelson could not have
knocked him out.

leaving her alone. At the last moment,
however, Fred T. Wood added Jerry
Lynch, and this left some semblance
of a race, to the delight of 5000 people
who were attracted to the track by the
promise of the appearance of the Fuller
filly, English Lad, and McGee. They
were sadly disappointed when they saw
the race riddled with 5 withdrawals. The
stake was worth 51850 to the winner,
with $350 to the second horse. Tokalon
was a prohibitive favorite at 1 to 25.

After the agt of 45 or 50, when .the vital powers are i^^i^Cr^^
naturally weaker, it is noticed that a hurt of any kind .^^^^^^
heals slowly, and often a very insignificant scratch or
bruise becomes a bad ulcer or sore. At this time of life
warty growths, moles and pimples that have been on the
body almost from birth begin to inflame and fester, and
before very long are large eating, sloughing ulcers.

The Length of a Dream.
"The other afternoon," said a doctor,
"I called to see a patient, and, much to
my satisfaction, I found him sleeping
soundly. I sat by his bed, felt his pulso
without disturbing him and waited for
him to awaken. After a few minutes a
dealer's cart,, with discordant ringing
bells, turned Into the street, and as
their first tones reached me my patient
opened his eyes.
" 'Doctor,* he said, 'I'm glad to sea
you, and awfully glad that you woko
me, for I have been tortured by a most
distressing dream that must have last
ed for several 'hours. I dreamed that I
was sick, as I am, and that my boy
came into the room with a string of
most horribly sounding bells and rans
them in my ears, while I hadn't power
to move or speak to him. I suffered
tortures for what appeared to be Inter
minable time, and I'm so glad you
awoke me.'
"The ringing of those bells for ona
second had caused all of that dream,
and just at the waking moment."â

Shipping- Intelligence.
?This old chestnut of a 4 to 1 score
is making: the fans mad, but it goes
every day at Recreation Park and yon
can't stop It. When Seattle made four
runs yesterday they quit and then let
San Francisco make one so that- the ;
tradition would hold good. But the
fans want something different. Each ,
one hopes that it will be 40 to 1 to
day.
It's getting monotonous, but still it
happens right along. The Siwashes cel
ebrated their fifth victory yesterday
without a break or a hitch. They did
not have to try at that. Everything
came easy for them. If hits did not
bring in the runs errors helped out, so
they came all the same and just about
as often as the northern stars would
have them.
Even though Jimmy "Whalen twirled
double-distilled ball that would win :
for anybody's ball team, he could not
get. away .with the game. Errors let
most of the tallies arrive, and hits
made them come if the errors were not
strong â¬<iough to go through. The na
tive tossers had about as much ginger
in them as horn toads.
At that they suffered some from
hard luck in the seventh, when "Wald
ron banged to right and Hilde walked.
Meany sacrificed 'em both along the
route. Cy Townsend then cut loose a
line drive that would have torn a hole
through. the fence had not Hall's anat
omy loomed up and forced the sphere |
to carom intf> Mohler's mitts.. Waldron
was extinguished at the pan, and the
next man died easy.
;A big league trick which old Van
pulled off in the third put the Siwashes
on the board. The patriarch had singled
â¢and V advanced on Mohler's sacritice.
Delehanty fouled to Cy Townsend, and
Cy was so elated over copping the ball j
that he paraded upand down. In front
of the "sun godt*,' swelling up and
making high signs at himself.
In the meantime old Van was hot
footing it to third base, and he slid in
cleverly amid the cheers of the fans
and the "chagrin of the Lodi kid. Frisk
beat out a skimpy bingle to short,
but It Was just good enough to put !
Van over the pan' with the initial run.
The score was'l up till the eighth,
when the Siwashes proceeded to break
it up, for fair. Mohler went as fat
as second on Irwin's bad wing to first.
He- landed on third when Anderson
wooderi-shoed the next one from Dele
/^anty's club. .Frisk forced Del at sec
ond, and then he and ; Mohler pulled
on! : a double steal. Williams cracked
the leather out of Rabbit Miller's
reach, and Frisky landed. Old "Carlo
pushed a double sacker ... over Hilde's
head, and on this Williams scooted In.

LOS ANGELES, July 30.âPhenom
enal pitching: by Charley Baum and
heavy batting: by Jud Smith were the
I striking: features of to-day's game,
j which went to the locals by the score
I of 7 to 1. Oakland did not gret a hit
off Baum until the eighth inning.
They failed to score until the ninth,
j when two hits gave them their only
j run. Smith made a three-base, a two
base and a single out of four times at
bat. With the exception of the third
inning, when Los Angeles scored 6
runs, the game was interesting and

The endurance run proposed to be
made jointly by the Automobile Club
of California and of Southern Califor
nia has been postponed. The plan
was for the' San Francisco automo-'
bilists to make the trir> to I.os Angeles
and back, and for the southern motor
ists to travel from Los Angeles to San
Francisco and back.
Last month L. P. Lowe, Chairman of
the executive committee of the Auto
mobile Club of California,' made an ex
perimental trip from San Francisco to
Los Angeles, stopping over night at
Salinas, San Luis Obispo and Santa
Barbara. He observed the condition of
the roads and the grades carefully,
making many observations with the
gradometer and measuring the distance
traveled with an odometer. The trip
was made under conditions as nearly as
possible the same as those of the pro
posed, endurance run. A total distance
of 506% miles was covered in an
elapsed time of 43 hours 16 minutes, or,
deducting the time consumed in stops
for the purpose of malting observations,
records and photographs, in a corrected
time of 31 hours 50 mjn.utes, the time
spent in controls not being reckoned in
either total. The average number of
miles per hour of elapsed time' was
11.71. and per hour of running time
15.92. The car carried passengers
weighing 620 pounds, 120 pounds of bag
gage and extra parts, without reckon
ing the water and gasoline. As the
weight to be carried in the endurance
run is 660 pounds, L. P. Lowe's car ex
ceeded this by ninety pounds. The rea
son for postponing the joint run is that
the Automobile Club of Southern Cali
fornia fevors the month of September.
j The endurance run being out of the
way for the present, the executive
committee of the Automobile Club of
California, will devote its attention to
making arrangements for the annual
run to Del Monte and for the race
meet there. The motorists will start
from San Francisco, Oakland, Ala
m6da and neighboring places on
Thursday, August 25. reaching Del
Monte that evening. Those who wish
to break the journey can .stop for the
night at San Jose or Gilroy, going on
to Del Monte early on Friday. Races
will be held on the Del Monte track on
Friday and Saturday, August 26 and
27, the programme being brought to
a close each day early before the air
becomes chilly. On Sunday a trip
around the seventeen-mile drive will
be made and next day the automobil
ists will return to their homes. It Is
expected that several motor car own
ers from Los Angeles and other towns
of Southern California will come up
to Del Monte with their machines. A
programme of the events is in course
of preparation and, will be issued next
week by the racing committee.
Annual Race Meet of the
Motorists Will Commence

Now that the school children have
been garnered in from tl5* woods and
flelds and seashore the -, migration
thither of the other people" has be
gun. And there is much philosophy
in awaiting the evacuation of the chil
dren a:id their accompanying friends,
ior during vacation tlii resorts are
crowded to the full limit and as for
yuiet and seclusion, it miffht as well
be sought in a. brass foundry. As for
the little ones â bless them â God made
therm, even as the youns of other an
imatf, to be frisky and frolicsome
and noisy, and thus should the coun
tryside be yielded to them during the
eix weeks of their respite from books.
It belongs to them. But now is the
grown-ups' time to shine.

Hugo Simens, a small boy employed
in the printing establishment of E.
Leidecker & Co., 156 New Montgomery
street, was treated at the Harbor Hos
pital yesterday for a badly broken
hand. He was printing postal cards
and to save one that had slipped tried
to grab it from under the press. The
press caught his hand, breaking the
bones right across. Although the ac
cident occurred about 9 a. m. it was
noon before the youngster's Injuries
received attention. His employer sent
him to a free dispensary, where he
waited for several hours and was re
ferred to the Harbor Hospital, where
Dr. Millar set the broken bones.

The bachelor officers at the Presidio
were hosts at a pleasant little hop on
Friday night. As usual, the popular
maids from the other posts were pres
ent, besides a' number of town girls.
To be sure, Captain Johnson and his
usual little supper party were much
missed, but Major Stevenson enter
tained a merry group after the hop.

George Whittell Jr. and Alfred B.
Swinton of San Francisco have arrived
in London and are staying at the Cecil
Hotel. These friends have planned a
trip to Paris and then, moving south
ward, will visit the principal cities of
Italy, thence to Switzerland, before re
turning again to London.
Mr. Cucuel will go to the Orient in a
few weeks for the Illustrated London
News to draw phases of social life in
the Land of the Rising Sun.
Beginning to-morrow, an exhibition
of Cucuel's pictures will be held at
Schussler's on Post street, when his
fellow townsmen may have an oppor
tunity to support or reject the verdict
of the European critics as to the merits
of his art. .*;.'
Among the clever men who toasted
to the further success of the young San
Frariciscan were Maynard Dixon, Giu
seppe Cadenasso, Xavier Martinez.
Robert Aitken, Charles Sedgwick
Aiken. George Sterling and Chester
Fernald.
Though many are the wits and bon
vivants who gather round the board of
the, red room of the Bohemian Club
to make merry over the noonday feast,
not often is there a cleverer group than
lunched there on Friday, when young
EiJM-ard Cucuel, the artist who has
wandered back to his native heath, was
entertained by his fellows-in-art. And
a merry group it was, who toasted â
aye, and roastedâ the splendid success
of their guestâ the plucky lad who left
San Francisco six years ago and went
to Europe to be discovered. The trib
utes paid to him by his fellows were
warmly appreciated by the wanderer.
Edward Cucuel received his early
training in art in San Francisco, sub
sequently studying in Munich, Dresden
and other. European art centers. He
made a specialty of themes of social
life. It is these that many of his
critics consider the basis of his repu
tation.

Every Hobo Is Worth a Round Dol
lar to Constables and Three
to Justices.
OAKLAND. July '30. â In view of
the opinion given -by the District At
torney to-day that under the decision
of the Supreme icourt the County
Auditor cannot pay constables and
Justices of the Peace except on a fee
basis the tramps and hobos are on
the run. A general descent is to be
made upon every vagrant in the coun
ty and it is expected that the jail will
be full in the next week. The rec
ords at the County Jail show that but
one tramp was arrested between June
14 and July 29. Last night five were
brought in and the number will go
skyward in a few days.
Constables and Justices will not
make expense money this month
owing to the general laxity. They will
now have UÂ» maktA urÂ» for lost time.
Every trnirp .-irrested is worth $1 and
mileage to the man making an arrest.
The Justices are also benefited, for an
a fee basis every case on the calendar
nets $3. A tramn thus costs' the
county %K and luheage besides his
maintenance while serving h-J sen
tence.

The railroad company has further ac
commodated the soldiers of *he State
so that the companies located at Marys
ville, Chico and Woodland will be con
veyed by special train, and will not be
required to start so* early as was orig
inally intended. Some slight change
has also been made to facilitate the
conveying of troops by the Santa Fe.
All baggage and equipment of the
State troops will be moved at the ex
pense of the United States Government.
All the officers have been supplied by
the # Unlted States War Department
with a neat pamphlet entitled "Instruc

study them carefully bo as to be pro
ficient when in the field.
The State has made an allowance of
10 cents per day for each man while
in camp, to enable each company to
purchase such luxuries as are not pro
vided by the army schedule.
Through the efforts of Colonel Wil
helm of the Governor's staff the equip
ments for the State troops are being
forwarded to destination.
Nothing officially has been done up
to yesterday In, the matter of the com
pany at Grass Valley that refused to
obey the order to go Into camp. There
has been considerable comment on the
part of guardsmen on the course of
Colonel Seymour in announcing: that he
would visit the company at its locale
and endeavor to have it go to camp.
It is understood now that he will issue
a direct order to the company to pro
ceed to camp, and If there is another
disobedience arrests will follow, and
steps will then be taken to muster the
company out of the service of the State.
Among the employers who have noti
fied the division headquarters that
such of their employes as are members
of the National Guard and desire to
attend the encampment will be permit

When it was decided that the Na

into camp this year it was ordered that
none above the rank of colonel should
take part in the maneuvers. This order
cut out brigade and staff officers, but

the following to take part in the field

in the railroad business, he continued,
vns sharper here than in most any
place in Americi^ still he knew of no
place where the railroad men worked
in greater harmony, or where friend?
ship was more closely cemented. He
would be here often, he said in con
clusion, and the knowledge that
friends were here would be like a wel
come home and each trip to San Fran
cisco he would anticipate with â¢pleas

Though all regretted that Countisa
has. been called to new fields of en
deavor, the knowledge that he will
visit this city perhaps once every
months raised the spirits of his friends
and merriment reigned. S. F. Booth
oi the Union Pacific as toastmaster
had a fund of wit at his command.
He assigned the serious phases of the
event to C. W. Colby as orator and re"^
inforced him with G. W. Luce and
others who responded to toasts. Wal
ter Kneiss and the association quartet
furnished the songs, and once or twice,
to the lively tunes of the orchestra, T.
W. Tenwinkel did the cakewalk around
the horseshoe table.
No jollier crowd ever gathered in
the banquet hall of the California
Hotel than the one that met yesterday
to extend wishes for a safe trip and a
prosperous future to R. H. Countiss,
agent of the Transcontinental Freight
Bureau, who will depart on August 3
for Chicago. Countiss was the guest
of the Pacific Coast Association of
Traffic Agents and his hosts repre
sented all the great roads of America.

Despite the strong, cold wind the
Golden Gate Park and the California
Club tennis courts were crowded yes
terday. On the park ccurt3 tht^ reor
ganized ladies* ! annex held its first
event, and it was successful in every
way. It was a scratch doubles tourna
ment for second class" players. Eight
teams competed, and In most cases the
matches were close. Miss Vera Crocker
and Miss Ida Mearns carried off the
honors, but only after winning several
close and hard-fought matches.
In the finals Miss Crocker and Miss
Mearns met Miss G. Meyer and Miss A.
Varden. The latter are two young girls
who have had no tournament experi
ence. . They played remarkably well for
beginners, and their more experienced
opponents had to play their best to
meat them. Miss Meyer and Miss Var
den won the first set, but their op
ponents were steadier and won the las*
two handily.
The best match of the day was that
between Miss D. Weed and Mis;*
Worcester and Miss Crccker and Miss
Mearns. All three sets were, close and
the games were long. Miss Weed played
veil at the net for one who had never
played there, and her 'â¢kill" shots were
roundly applauded. Miss Worcester
had never played in a tournament be
fore, but she was by no means out
classed.

The general committee of the Na

is arranging for the celebration of
Admission day in this city, has now
completed the list of sub-committees
to have charge of the various events
of the day. It has also perfected the
general plan for the Oakland celebra
tion. Among other details the com
mittee has voted to hold the literary
exercises immediately after the pa
rade, which will take place at 10 a.
m., September 9. These exercises will
be held either at the Willows or in
the City Hall Park.
Arrangements have been made with
the railroad companies whereby ex
cursion trains will be run from Sac
ramento, Stockton, San Jose and
San^i.Cruz. A large number of vis
itors is expected from San Francisco
and from the interior towns of Ala
meda County. The members of the
San. Francisco parlors will parade
down Market street in San Francisco
on the evening of July 8, and will
take a special boat for this city 5 , where
they will be received at the head
quarters of the several local parlors.
On the morning of the 9th they will
participate in the Oakland parade.
The general committee has decided
to close the celebration with a grand
ball at Armory Hall on the evening of
September 9, and the members of
Oakland Parlor have arranged for a
dance of their own at Maple Hall.

operating with the United States De

tests on the university grounds to de
termine the amount of water evapor

will be valuable to the irrigationists
of the coast region, as it will deal with
a problem that has long puzzled them.
The tests are being made with six
large tanks filled with water and set
out in the open air. The water is kept
i at various degrees of temperature in
; the different tanks, ranging from 50
to 90 degre '. Fahrenheit. Measure
ments of the anks are taken every two
hours during the day and at intervals
of three hours during the night. At
the same time the temperature of the
and the velocity of the
wind is carefully noted and registered,
so that the conditions under which the
changes take place may be Jcnown.
The work is being carried on by
Herbert Newell, a graduate of the uni
versity and a member of the United
States Irrigation Bureau, who is as
sisted by D. F. Griffith, another em
ploye of the bureau.

The matter of the assessment of the
ferry-boats belonging to the Southern
PaciJic Company was adjusted, with
?he consent of all parties, at the valua
tions at which the boats were assessed
in San Francisco.
The assessment of the franchises of
the Oakland Gas, Light and Heat Com
pany for the cities of Oakland, Ala
meda and Berkeley w.ere reduced by
the Board of Equalization at its ses
sion this morning from $400,000 to $170,
000. Many minor petitions for reduc
tions were presented by private per
sons. A number of these were granted.
Promptly at the noon hour the board
adjourned sine die.
In support of the petition for reduc
tion of the assessment on its franchises
the gas company was represented by
its president, John A. -Britton. and hiss
attorney, John A. McDonald. They
argued to the board that their fran
chises were not exclusive but such as
any one could get and that they placed
no value en them. They also declared
that the company had to make a profit
over its expenses, and if the expenses
should, be made heavier by increased
taxes it in turn would have to charge
more for its product. They failed to
Fee how anything was to be gained by
such a procedure, and said, further,
that it was taxing the people of the
city for money which ultimately was
spent out over the county.
At the end of the hearing the fol
lowing reductions were made: The
franchise to construct and maintain
gas work? and lay gas pipes in the
city of Oakland, assessed at $250,000,
was reduced'to $50,000: the franchise to
t,Vect and maintain poles and electric
Aires in the city of Oakland, assessed
at Tl'SO.tiOQ, was reduced to 4100,000; the
franchise of the company over the
streets of Alameda, assessed at $50,000.
was reduced to $10,000; the franchise
over the streets of Berkeley, assessed
at $7?,000. was reduced to $10,000.

ST. LOUIS, July 30.-*Tohn J. Ryan
arrived in St. Louis to-day in the cus
tody of Detective Killian. to answer
four indictments charging the em
bezzlement of $300,000. Other indict
ments charge the larceny of smaller
sums. Ten minutes after Ryan ar
rived over the Pennsylvania his at
torney, Charles Nolan, stepped from an
Illinois Central train, rr yeallng 1 a chase
with the latter, made from New York
as the result of a ruse Killian had
planned to get hi3 prisoner.
Nolan declares that Ryan was kid
naped by Killian and George Fickela
sen, the attorney who went to Jersey
City to represent the State in any legal
proceedings that might arise. Nolan
is outspoken in denouncing thÂ» meth
ods he says Fickeissen used in getting
Ryan out of New Jersey.
Ryan was released by the Sheriff in
bonds of $7000, for which his sister-in
law, Mrs. Mary Maloney, went se
curity.
While the search was going on Sar
gent disappeared. Hatless and coatless
he had run for cover. Neighbors last
saw him making for the hills. He left
behind him an aged mother, with
whom he made his home. She sougW
to help her son out of his trouble by
offering to restore all the st.olen goods,
but this offer will not save the son if
he is caught.
Besides Dallerup's property many
things known to have belonged to
other people were fou^d in Sargent's
place. Some of these were discovered
beneath a pile of hay In the barn. What
Sargent wanted with many of the
things is a mystery, they were such
as could not be soldi
Besides being a carpenter, E. A. Sar
gent, said to be a graduate of the State
University of Washington, is a trickster
cf no mean ability. This was demon
strated to-day, when a search tÂ»f his
house at 1G23 Leroy avenue revealed
two or three trunks full of stuff he had
stolen from the man upon whose house
be was working. And while hia house
was IÂ» ing searched Sargent again
showed his cleverness by giving the po
lice the slir> and making for the hills.
Sargent hall a way that was all his
own. It was eo novel that even the
men who were set to watch him could
not catch him in the act. His scheme
consisted in riding off.' on a bicycle
when he quit work in the afternoon
and then, after circling around the
block a few times to deceive his fellow
workmen, return and help himself to all
the good things in sight.
Sargent practiced his scheme at the
house of Benjamin Da/lerup of 1613
Prince street,' where he helped as a car
penter. Every night when Dallerup
came home he noticed something miss
ing. Finally he put a detective on the
trail of Sargent, whose actions had ex
cited suspicion. But Sargent always
eluded detection, and it was not until
he betrayed himself by denying his own
house address that the officers fixed
upon him as their man.
Sargent worked up to noon to-day on
the house and then went home. This
gave the officers their chance to catch
him. They got a search Warrant in
Justice Samuels' court this afternoon.
Then they went to Sargent's house â
Deputy Marshals- Howard and Pickett
and Dalle-ui> himself. Sargent was In
the garden, bareheaded" and coatless,
when they arrived. After the warrant
was read to him he bade the officers
search if they wished to. Apparently
he was undismayed.
Search of the house revealed all the
things Dallerup had missed. There were
gold and silver watches, clothing. Ma
sonic emblems, jewelry, rugs and
blankets, all carefully piled away in
big chests, worth probably $500 alto
gether. This plunder was afterward re
moved to the City Hall, where it will
be held as evidence.

To handle su -cegsfully the increased
number of trains that the new sched
ule will require the company has
found it necessary to construct a dou
ble track trestle at ihe estuary cross
ing. Owing: to heavy demands on the
construction department the comple
tion of the additional track has been
delayed. Resumption of operation*
means that th<? work will be hastened
as rapidly as possible.
No definite time has been set for the
beginning of a twenty-minute service,
but company offccials say jt will not
be long: before the additional trains
vill be runninsr.
In thi3 connection the Merchants'

Francisco, touching the plans for an
a:!-ni;rht ferry service. Â¦
The Southern Pacific Company has
resumed the work of filling; the new
trestle across the north arm of the
estuary at Seventh street, preparatory
to the operation of a double track at

The bill of sale was duly executed by
Gilpin at Colfax, and covers all or*
the horses, harness, wagons, stock, fix
tures and" personal property In which
Gilpin had an interest. The considera
tion named in the transfer was of the
nominal amount of $10.
Johnson filed the bill of sale this
afternoon at the County Recorder's ot
fice for record. This was done to pro
tect himself against any proceedings
that Gilpin's creditors might take.
When questioned concerning the
transaction Johnson declined to talk.
So far as Gilpin's financial affairs
are concerned no other move was made
to-day. Tranlc H. Brooks of the Cali
fornia Bank, which has loanetl Gilpin
a considerable amount on notes, said
to-day: - *
"You can say emphatically that so
far as this bank is concerned there is
no action contemplated at this time
against Gilpin. We are in communica
tion with him and expect to receive
some v.-ord shortly."
F. L. Krause. attorney for H. Blais,
who has levied an attachment on prop
erty of -Mrs. Gilpin to secure a claim
on a promissory note of $1500, said:
"Our claim Is. now in court, and we
expect to conduct the litigation there
that is necessary to recover. We have
no knowledge that there is anything
irregular."
Mystery surrounding the sudden de
parture from the city of George W.
Johnson, partner of former City Treas
urer Z. T. Gilpin In the Standard Wood
Company, was cleared to-day, when
Johnson returned to Oakland with a
bill of sale to Johnson from Gilpin ot
all of his interests in the concern. The
document, attested by Morris Libner,
notary public of Placer County, was
of date yesterday.

LOCAL MARKETS.
Peaches were the leading feature of the fruit
market during the early trade, and as fresh
supplies arrived rather late thÂ« market had a
chance to clean up. but the abundance of car-
Hed-over etock prevented an advance In prices.
The belated trains and boats brought large
con*lgnmentiÂ«. which were offered freely at lib
eral concessions, and as usual large lines had
to be held over. The market was particularly
weak for larse boxes, which constituted the
bulk of the supplies brought by the delayed
narrow-gauge train. Small packages of other
tree frulta were in good request for local use
and shipping account, but bulk stock was dull,
as the canners were overloaded with contract
goods and were Indifferent buyers. Plums were
Btlll abundant and sold at a wide range as to
variety and quality, while fancy wrapped Bart,
lett Pears were steady under decreased receipts
from the river districts. The Apple market
was overstocked and weak, with Â«ome dealers
quoting $1 per box as the top for the best
Gravenstelng In 4-tler boxes. Figs ruled steady
under light receipts and Melons were flrm. al
though receipts were liberal. Grapes were very
dull and the top quotation for the Seedless va
riety was obtained only for some strictly fancy
etock In crates from Sultana, Tulare County,
G3c. being an extreme figure for crates from
other sections. Blackberries continued weak,

pllefc being plentiful and trade active at the
low prices. A good Inquiry was noted for low
grade stock in sacks for shipment to the South

fering at 7c per pound and sold slowly, while
fresh arrivals from the river were readily dis
posed of at 3c per pound. Onions were plen
tiful and weak at previous prices.
Green Corn In crates was In good request
and brought higher prices, while everything
else lu the vegetable line was in excessive
supply and weak. and. as usual, there wag a
heavy surplus of all descriptions unsold at the
close.

gain of about a cent at the Immediate start,

ber was a shade lower to %@>4c higher at 00>4
Â«!.(>%c. Other factors Jhat contributed to the
bullish sentiment were numerous reports from
the Northwest of damage to the growing crop
by rust, and the strong tone of continental ca
bles. No quotutions were received from Liver
pool, owing to a holiday there. Soon after the
opening an active <V;niand from foreigners for
the yilstant deliveries developed, followed by
good buying by pit traders. The price of Sep
tember v.-us liftcil to i'lliiC, but reacted again
to l)0%c. Meantime July made about a cent
advance from the opening price. Later the
demand from shorts became so urgent that
July made a suillen rise to $1 0O%. Under
the influence of this sharp return distant de
liveries also advanced. September filing up to
Ul'h.c. A quick reaction, however, followed.
Small holders who had been waiting for the
price of July to reach the dollar mark tagerly
took advantage of the opportunity to eecure
profits. The celling was of sufficient volume
to cause a decline in that month to 97c At
the same time t-eptember sold off to lK)'.4c.
Renewed covering by shorts again started July
upward anil final figures were at 90 %c. Other
deliveries failed to rally, September closing at
90%c.
In sympathy with the strength of wheat a.
firm tone was manifested in the corn market
the prreater part of the day. September opened
unchanged to a shade higher at 49%c to 49%^*
49Â«4c. sold between 4O',4c and 49?4c and closed
at 4:)V4fiN9%c.
A small flurry In July immediately after the
closing was a feature of trading in oats. Sep
tember opened a shade lower at 33'4c. sold be
tween 33)4tP33Hc an^ closed at the low point.
Local receipts were 12i> cars.
Provisions were easy on selling for outside
account and on a lack of support from packers.
A weak hog mjrket had a depressing Influ
ence. The market closed near the low point,
with September pork down 12%@15c at $12 02%

â¢ The President and his advisers
agreed that at no point had any of
the conditions passed beyond the
scope of legal treatment, nor was the
administration called upon at this
time to take action. As for the pend
ing meat strike, although it was not
specifically discussed at the confer
ence, it can be stated that the admin
istration does not consider that a na
tional emergency has been precipitat
ed, as was the case in the coal strike.
Until such an emergency has been cre
ated there will be no official consider
ation of it by the administration.
WASHINGTON. July 30.â Labor con
ditions generally throughout the coun

Labor Carroll D. Wright.
Several matters were considered and
action upon them will be taken later.
The conference was of considerable im
portance to the administration and to
labor generally. The President author
ized the announcement that the Chi
cago strike was not mentioned at the
conference.

LOUISVILLE, Ky.. July 30.â An un
known enemy made an attempt to take
the life of Charles Norrts by a horrible
method at his home near Jeftersonville,
Ind., to-day.
Mrs. . Donahue, a neighbor, early to
day telephoned to Norris that there was
a snake on his front gate. Norris hur
ried out and found that a viper had
been fastened to the gate, with its head
near the latch. The reptile was so ar
ranged that it could not be seen from

in Attempting to Take
a Life.
NAILS VIPER TO LATCH
OF HIS ENEMY'S GATE
This part of the plan was usually
carried out in the outskirts of some
village or in a farmer's house In some
lonely place. Lured by his fair be
trayer to the chosen spot, the victim
would be pounced upon by the band
and either plundered of hi3 money or
made to promise that he would con
tr bute ; a specified amount to the treas
ury of the society.
From 5000 employes on the Croton
dam the band is said to have obtained
more than $5000 in this manner, be
sides the money secured from farm
ers, hackmen and other persons
whom they openly robbed.

A young and pretty Italian girl is the
leader of a gang of fifteen men who
have been terrorizing Westchester
County for two weeks and who were
arraigned in court to-day In connec
tion with a series of 200 robberie3 per
petrated in this vicinity.
The girl's custom was to pick out a
compatriot said to have money, seek
his acquaintance, and, when his confi
dence was fully won, arrange to have
him robbed.

The conference held between the
Stable and Carriage Owners' Associa^
tion and the representatives of the
Hackmen's and Stablemerfs unions
yesterday bore no result as to a set
tlement of the trouble. The associa
tion's representatives stood firm on
the "open shop" policy, but with an
understanding that union men would
be employed when vacancies occurred.
In other words, there are to be no dis
criminations for or against any man
who may apply for work. The con
ference was asked for by the joint
committee of the Hackmen's and Sta
blemen's unions, who are anxious for
a settlement of the strike.
Peace reigns in the boiler-makers'
shops of the Pacific Railroad Com
pany, where the boiler-makers struck
last week on the coast line. The meet
ing held yesterday between the repre
sentatives of both factions was produc
tive of the settlement by which the
men returned to work. The presence
of Grand President John McNeil of
the Brotherhood of Boiler-makers,
who was spokesman for the men, had
a good deal to do with the speedy ad
justment of the trouble.
After an almost all night session the
Labor Council on Friday night elect
ed all of its officers except that of
president. For this office there was
quite a contest between the present
occupant, George B. Benham, and J.
O. "Walsh of the Iron Molders' Union.
Each man got 141 votes, with one vote
in dispute, which was referred to. the
executive for examination with "in
structions to report at the next meet
ing, when it is probable that another
vote will be taken to decide the issue.
Â» The following are the officers so far
elected:
Carriage Owners' Association Will
. Adhere to Open Shop Policy.
. . Boiler-Makers at Work.
REFUSE TO DISCRIMINATE
AGAINST NON-UNION MEN
PORTLAND, July SO. â United
States Circuit Judge Lacombe'a de
cision, handed down In New York to
the effect that the Indictment against
John A. Benson of San Francisco falls
to set forth facts tending to show con
spiracy to commit an offense against
or defraud the United States, Involves
no principle of Federal law affecting
the McKInley-Ware-Puter land fraud
cases now pending in the local United
States Court, according to United
States District Attorney John H. Call.
The Government's attorney holds that
{here is a material difference between
the Benson-Hyde-Dimond cases and
those implicating McKlnley and
others.
In the cases pending trial here thfÂ»
method used, is alleged to be that
dummies were employed, but their
forged and fraudulent filings were
made directly upon Government lands
and the Government lost the land, re
ceiving in return nothing but the filing
1ms. In these cases .the State's in
terests were not involved, as i3 claim
ed in the Benson-Hyde cases.
