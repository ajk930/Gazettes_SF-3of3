REPUBLICAN PARTY'S UN AN I MO US CHOICE FO R STANDARD. BEARER.
Sitting tilted back in a big armchair
at his desk the President chatted freely
and frankly with those about him. AH
were his personal friends, and the Pres
ident realized perfectly that the little
confidences of the "executive session,"
as he himself termed It. would be held
as Inviolable. He talked and acted not
as President of the United States, not
President Roosevelt rose from his
chair to receive the affectionate con
gratulations of those about him. He
was the most unconcerned, seemingly,
of all. He chatted animatedly a few
minutes with Mrs. Roosevelt, Miss
Carew and Loeb, and then accom
panied his secretary to the executive
offices.
ATTENDS. TO ROUTINE WORK.
Outward indications that Theodore
Roosevelt was to be chosen unanimous
ly as the standard-bearer of his party
absolutely were lacking at the White
House in the morning. The President
appeared at his desk at the usual hour
and began" immediately to transact rou
tine executive business with Secretary
Loeb. The important subjects disposed
of, he received several - visitors .for
Â«hom engagements had been made.
No members of the Cabinet called dur
ing the early hours of the business
day. The President was kept In close
touch with the situation at Chicago
through the press bulletins and private
messages from the convention hall,
which were received over a special
wire at the White House.
On his return to the executive offices
after he had been informed of his
nomination. President Roosevelt greet
ed cordially a number of newspaper
men. He expressed his pleasure at re
ceiving the warm congratulations of
those who. In the performance of their
duties, are kept constantly" in touch
with the President and his work.
CHATS WITH FRIENDS.
WASHINGTON, June 23.âSurround
ed by members of his family. President
Roosevelt received the announcement
that he had been nominated unani
mously by the Republicans at Chicago.
The news was received by telephone at
the White House by a press repre
sentative In advance of its receipt over
the special telegraph wire running from
Chicago to the executive offices.
At 1i:lZ p. m. the bulletin was given
to Secretary Loeb. Some time previ
ously the President had left his offices
in the executive building and had gone
to the White House for luncheon. Sec
retary Loeb immediately conveyed the
news to him there. Seated on the
veranda of the White House, chatting
with Mrs. Roosevelt, his sister-in-law.
Miss Carew and other members of his
family, tjie President received Loeb's
announcement.
Chairman Parker of the Missouri del
egation presented to the committee an
A resolution was adopted authorizing
the chairman to appoint an executive
committee of nine, with such other of
ficers as are necessary for ther'manage
ment of the campaign. The chairman,
secretary, treasurer and sergeant-at
arms are to-be officers of the executive
committee. Under this resolution the
chairman is ; given absolute power in
the conduct of the campaign.
INVITATION* FROM FRANCIS.
- After Cortelyou's remarks Elmer Do
ver. of Ohio was named as secretary by
Senator. Scott. Cornelius N. Bliss of
New Â¦ York . for treasurer by Governor
Murphy and William F. Stone of Mary
land for sergeant-at-arms by Senator
Mi Comas. All of these officers were
unanimously re-elected.
Â¦No 'vice chairman will be appointed,
and the new chairman will divide his
time between the New York and Chi
cago headquarters, although some
members of. the committee no doubt
will be designated to take charge of
the headquarters In this city. Head
quarters will not be opened in either
city | until ' l the latter part of July.
Meanwhile Cortelyou expects to select
the executive committee and make his
preliminary arrangements for the cam
paign.
s As soon as the committee was called
to order, Postmaster General Payne, in
a complimentary speech, nominated
Cortelyou- for chairman, and the elec
tion was made without a dissenting
voice. Clayton of Arkansas, Murphy of
New Jersey and Yerkes of Kentucky
were appointed a committee to notify
the new chairman and bring him be
fore ' the committee.
CHICAGO, June 23.â George B. Cor
telyou was chosen chairman of the
Republican â¢National Committee at a
meeting held to-day, just after the ad
journment of the national convention.
2n thanking the committee for the
honor, he told the members that, whHe
he would be glad to have the benefit
of their, advice and counsel, he in
tended to be chairman in fact, and
would accept no dictation from any one,
high or low. He told them that the
friends of the late Chairman Hanna
were his friends, and he asked for
the same measure of confidence and
support that had been given to the
late chairman. In conclusion, he
sought the advice of both old and new
members. Â¦
Cortelyou made Â«S formal statement
of his plans. He had resigned as Sec
retary of Commerce and Labor as soon
as he was elected chairman, the resig
nation to take effect as soon as bis
successor qualifies, which will be about
July 1. Secretary Cortelyou will nor
give any active time to political mat
ters until he retires from the Cabinet.

When the convention was called to

for the first time. Tiers of people

of the rows of seats. Former Gover

CROWD PACKS COLISEUM.
When Senator Fairbanks had been
nominated for Vice President there was
no diminution in the demonstration.
The voices were hoarse, but the shout-
Ing was as general as it was for the
head of the ticket.
The delegates in their eagerness to
exhibit approval of the nomination
accepted every signal for renewed
-cheering. A little colored boy from
Georgia, and later a pretty little girl
dressed in a dainty frock of white, were
lifted to the platform, where they
waved flags vigorously.
At the conclusion of every seconding
speech the outburst was repeated, and
the speakers themselves were generally
applauded.
The chairman tired and his place was
taken by a young man, who grasped
the flagstaff firmly in one hand and
with a megaphone led the yelling. He
started to yell, "Roosevelt, Roosevelt,
Roosevelt," repeated over a^d over
over again, with the system of a college
yell. It was taken up by the throng,
and the cry of "Jioosevelt" rolled over
the hall in volumes so great and so ter
rific that the screeching of a hundred
steam whistrw v/ouid have been
dwarfed in comparison.
LIKE A COLLEGE YELL.
When Governor Black of New York
made his speech nominating President
Roosevelt to succeed himself as Presi
dent, the delegates in the . Republican
Convention proved there was no ab-
Fcnce of enthusiasm in their ranks
when occasion Justified an exhibition
cf that Quality. For twenty-five min
utes the great throng told its approba
tion of the convention's choice for
President. The name of Roosevelt
came from every mouth. The New
York delegates paraded the hall, shout
ing at the top of their voices. Other
delegations joined the procession, and
the- weJ! ordered body of a half hour
before was a shifting mass, every
eemblance of organization gone.
While the demonstration was at its
height Chairman Cannon stepped to
the front of tne stage. He held in his
hand the banner which was waved in
1SG0 when Lincoln was nominated, and
â¢which fcas been used in every conven
tion since. The flex showed the wear
and tear of ' many similar contests.
"Uncle Joe" wa\-cd It vigorously and
kept time with his body. Soon the
Â¦whole convention was swaying in exact
measure.
1 rfiii^'i by a resounding demonstration
vbich attested the candidates' great
popularity. The charing was l<=d by
figures known through the breadth of
the land and echoed by a mighty
throne of enthusiastic men and radiant
vomen assembled in the Coliseum to
witness the crowning feature of the
convention, as well as the close of th<*
rational meeting that marks the semi
centennial of the Republican party in
the United States.
No less than 10,000 men and women
participated in the ratification of the
party programme and the consequent
roar of cheering and handclapping was
de&feninp. The band, stationed high
among tho girders of the hall, was
browned by the tumultuous, unbounded
demonstration. Hats were tossed into
the air, State emblems were waved
and flags â beautiful, tri-colored, shim
mering, silktn flags â fluttered from
every hand, as though stirred by a

"Geography counts but little with the
sentiment and enthusiasm that is to
day apparent in favor of one who is to
be given all the honors anoTduties of
an elected President of the United
States," Knight said when silence was
restored. Continuing in epigramatic
style he thrilled the convention for
many minutes. His voice never fal
tered. His name was spoken in terms
of congratulation on every side. When
he had ceased, and with waving ban
ners the California delegation marched
to the platform to escort him to his
seat, the great Coliseum rocked with
the cheers of the multitude.
California's headquarters were in
darkness to-night. The wines and fruits
had been distributed among the fortu
nate friends cf the delegates and the
last toast had been drunk. Several of;
the delegates have departed already,
and more will go to-morrow. "Within
three days the last California delegata
will have departed from Chicago.
PARDEE GOES TO -T. LOUIS.
Again the tempest broke. Out of the
wilderness of silence had come a
human voice. It had been heard and
understood. The convention was over
joyed: its enthusiasm must find vent.
THRILLS THE CONTENTION.
Knight's voice reached to the farthest
pillar and echoed back from the giant
arches. With a howl of delight the con
vention Â» arose, and the waving flags
with their crimson stripes were like a
sea of flame. Speaker Cannon, with
the gavel in his left hand pounding for
order and his right uplifted command

the uproar continued. "When silence
came again Knight continued:

LONDON EXPERT OPINION.
Much of the testimony offered at the
afternoon session had to do with the
condition of ' the life' preservers. Al
most without exception the stories of
the witnesses were to the effect that
they were of little value.
In asking an adjournment until Mon
day Mr. Garvin said he hoped to com
plete his case during that day and may
do so in time for the Jury to take it
during the afternoon. Coroner Berry
granted the request and then declared
the inquiry adjourned until Monday.
With the approval of the District
Attorney the members of the crew
who were held at the House of De
tention were released from custody.
The bodies of fifty-one, unidentified
victims of the General Slocum disaster
wtre buried to-day in the Lutheran
Cemetery, Long Island. The bodies of
fifty identified victims, were, also In
terred, a majority of them being rela
tives of the victims already buried.
The Slocum could have been beached
at the foot of One Hundred and Thirty
first street and in from three to five
minutes saved, according to the testi
mony of John Van Gilder, superin
tendent of the New York. New Haven
and Hartford Railroad lighter service.
Captain Edward Van Wart, senior
pilot of the Slocum, said' he was in the
pilot house with his assistant. Weaver,
and Captain Van Schaick. He said it
was about half a minute from the time
the warning was received that the boat
â¢wag on fire that the captain gave the
crder to beach her. Captain Van Wart
said 250 new life preservers were pur
chased for the Slocum in 1895. ' He
was not sure whether they were ex
amined at the. beginning of the season.
NEW YORK;, June 23.â The Slocum
inquiry was resumed to-day. Captain
Van Schalck was brought in on a
stretcher, but It was decided not to call

school, delivered the diplomas to the
graduates. â¢ â¢ â¢ Â¦ . Â¦
: The regular June graduation exer
cises at the San Jose Normal School
was held this morning. An audience
was present that completely filled the
assembly, hall. , The decorations were of
bulrushes and sunflowers and the col
ors of the class, two shades of green.
On tte stage beside President M. E.
Dailey were Dr. George C. Adams and
State Superintendent of Schools Kirk.
Rev. L. O. Herrold offered a prayer. A
vocal solo, "My Dreams," was rendered
by Fred F. Moore of Alameda, a grad
uate of the sghool. Dr. George. C,
Adams, pastor of the First Congrega
tional Church of San Francisco, deliv
ered the address to the graduates. His
theme was * Education and Its His
tory." Superintendent Kirk made a few
remarks. John H. Littler, president of
the graduating class, presented the
school with a stained glass window on
behalf of the class, and Roy Andrews
accepted the gift in behalf of the stu
dent body. President Bailey then pre
sented the diplomas to the graduates.

SAN JOSE, June 23.â A fashionable
audience crowded the hall at the High
School this morning to witness the an

exercises and the I Rev. J. Wilmer
Gresham followed with an invocation.
Gifford B. West delivered an oration

. John McNaught, manager of The San
Francisco Call, delivered the-address to
the graduating class. His subject was
"The Leisure Hour." He said that to
most people the hour of leisure is fully
as valuable as the hour of labor. It
may be said that when at work man
serves society, but when at leisure he
serves himself. In one case he is help
ing to build up civilization and in the
other he is building up his own charac
ter and establishing his personality
as a distinct and independent factor in
the community. The speaker said no
man can afford to neglect the joyous
side of life and so develop within him
self a. wholesome and worthy life that
will be not leas beneficial to the com
munity than the product of h}s most
laborious hours.

NOMINEE'S MOTHER PLEASED.
George A. Knight of California had
a voice which fairly thundered
through the hall. The orator from
the Golden Gate City had the conven
tion with him from the flrst. ' His
speech was pointed, and Knight
proved to be a man of phrases. The
California 'delegates started a parade
around the convention hall at the
close of Knight's speech.
When New Jersey asked for unani
mous consent that the roll be dispensed
with and that thÂ« secretary of the con
vention be instructed to cast the entire
vote for Mr. Roosevelt the response
was general and every State accepted
the opportunity of casting its entire
vote for the President.
(Pandemonium ' broke loose again
when the speaker announced that there
were 994 votes and 994 had been.ca/st
fcr Mr. Roosevelt.' A great picture of
the President was carried . about
through the hall. It was followed by a
banner carried by the Oregon delega
tion bearing the words:
"First gun, Oregon, 23,844. Forty per
cent Republican gain." ' Â»
The usual resolutions of. thanks to
officers of the convention and to com
mittees on arrangements were adopted
before the great, body was adjourned.
Speaker Cannon came in for Nine of
the resolutions, and he bluehed like a
schoolboy as the word-bouquet was
given him. He made eleven speeches
during the day, each of a few crisp
original sentences, introducing the
eleven orators. His audience never tired
of watching or hearing him. He was a
t-auc* to the proceedings. His jerky
walk to and from the peninsula of the
platform that projected into the audi
ence amused eve/-y one. He kept a tight
hold on the right hand of each speaker
with his right hand and swung the
gavel in his left. The wide sweep of
th *ieavy mallet rather terrified mem
bers of the press who were within
range, for sometimes their heads es
caped by not more than an inch.
"When Speaker Cannon spoke his
whole body shook, his left arm made
full circles, both legs j vibrated and
even his toes could be seen working
up and down in his shoes. His control
of the convention was complete.
After the crowd ' had yelled itself
hoarse it permitted the band to par
ticipate in the demonstration.. The
leader chose patriotic music, and the
familiar words were taken up by the
convention and sung with earnestness.
The music- changed to ragtime and
the convention found' cheering was
better timed to the music. Several
times Speaker Cannon .walked out on
the projection to the platform extend
ing' between rows of press seats and
lifted his hands for order. The crowd
thought he was leading the applause
and paid no attention.
Roosevelt as the best example of that
type the convention arose. The New
York delegation led in the cheering,
which almost 'immediately spread to
every part of the lloor, to the gal
leries and to the crowds which : filled
the entrances and overflowed into the
streets.

DELEGE CHOICE
OF THE DRUIDS
In the death of ', Professor George
Bates, who passed away at Santa Cruz
last Tuesday^ California | has lost one
of the most prominent educators con
nected with its history. Less than half
a ' century ago Bates ' Academy
was one of the most popular pre
paratory schools Id the State. Mr. Bates
was so proficient in this work that his
services were sought by the Regents of
the University as soon as this institu
tion came under State control.
There are quite a number of promi
nent men to-day who received their
training in Bates Academy and who
are Justly proud -of their alma, mater.
The news of* their former master's
death will touch them greatly. His San
Francisco school was first established
on Hyde street, but was removed later
to 2310 Clay street.
The funeral will take place to-day at
2 o'clock from his late residence on Clay
street. Services will be held at the cre
matorium in the Odd Fellows* Ceme
tery.

CHEFU, June 23.â It is reported here
that the. Japanese made a determined
attack upon Port Arthur from land and
sea yesterday,* June 22. and also during
the night. Two steamers Just arrived
passed Port Arthur at 1 o'clock this
morning some distance oft* shore. The
captains, both reliable men, say they
did not hear any firing at that hour.
CHICAGO. June 23.â A special to the
Dally News from Chefu says:
Reconnaissance in force of the ap
proaches to Port Arthur was made yes
terday by a Japanese flotilla of three
destroyers and four torpedo-boats,
which ran In from the .east about noon
and cruised along the whole bluff, com
ing out past Laothieshan promontory.
As the flotilla steamed along it was
heavily engaged with the forts, but ap
parently suffered no damage, although
a signal mast of one of the torpedo
boats was knocked out of shape as if
struck by a shell. The operation was
backed ay some distance by two cruis
ers, one .of which appeared to be the
Yakuma,' while- one auxiliary cruiser, a
noted San Francisco liner, the" Nippon,
or a sister ship, acted as sea scout in
the rear.
Shortly afterward heavy firing began
on the land side, lasting intermittently
until dusk.

HIS FEARLESS HONESTY.
Coming into the position of the martyred
McKlnley, tho youngest chief magistrate that
has ever nlled the Presidential chair, without
the * privilege and advantage of preliminary
discussion and consultation, he gave the coun
try a - pledge that he would I carry out the
policies of his predecessor. It was a master
stroke of genius, applauded alike North and
South. His- -conception of the duties of his
high office, as formulated by him at Harvard,
was "to serve all alike, weiu to act in a
spirit of fairness and justice to all men and
to give each man his rights," . He has kept
this pltdgt; he fas lived up to this flne con
ception of his duty. This pledge Involved a
completion of the work begun In Cuba and
an honorable discharge of the promises made
to our struggring neighbor. The flag of an
Independent republic floats over Havana to
day, and" all men know that we have kept
faith with the Cuban people. Leaving: the
details to engineers, he has cut as by a single
stroke the Panama canal, through mountains
of prejudice and centuries of ignorance. In
tho. far Philippines our flag floats,, a guarantee
of '.redemption, pacification and development.
His conception of duty has led him Into dif
ficult places In dealing with the internal af
fairs of our. own country; he has met every
issue bravely and ably and demonstrated not
only that prompt and decided action Is often
the highest expression of conservatism, hut
that It 1Â« safe to trust the impulse of a man
who is essentially and instinctively honest.
Fellow countrymen. â¢ after nearly four years
of I Theodore Roosevelt we find the army and
navy on a better footing, . our trade expended,
the country 'at peace and prosperous and our
flag respected In every quarter of the globe.
The American people will not withhold from
him the applause of manly hearts. I am
proud that my State, the Empire State of the
South, shares in the glory of his achievement*.
as It will share in their benefits.
TO SERVE ALL ALIKE, WELL.
Tho childhood of. the good woman who bore
him was cast nfear where the Atlantic flows In
over the marsh and the sand. There she first
built her a home in the greatness of God.
Womanhood found her within 1 the uplifting
view of the mountains in a land over which
the Almighty inverts a sapphire cup by day
and sets his brightest stars on guard, by night.
And there, fellow countrymen, the soul of your
President was born. Those, of us who know
and love him catch in the. easy flow of his
utterance and feel in its largeness of thought
and contempt of littleness the rhythm of the
ocean on tho Georgian sands and the spirit of
the deep.' In his lofty Ideals and hopefulness.
In his fixedness of purpose and unchanging
rock-ribbed honesty, we -Bear the mountains
calling-. In hie darjng. his Impulsive courage,
his unconquerable manhood, we see his great
brother, the Georgia volunteer, Jn the hand to
hand fights of the Wilderness, tho Impetuous
rush up the heights of Gettysburg and the de
fiance of overwhelming odds from Chattanooga
to . Atlanta. We look at him as a Georgian
Dbroad, and If In the providence of God It may
be bo we ehall welcome him homo some day,
not as a prodigal son, who has wasted his man
hood, but as one who on every field of endeavor
has hnr.oreJ his mother and worn the victor's
wreath.
CHICAGO, June 23. â Harry Still-,
well Edwards of Georgia spoke on be
half of the Roosevelt nomination' as
follows:
It Is eminently fit and proper that a
Georgian should on this occasion second the
eloquent speaker from New York that the
voice of the. Motherland should blend with the.
voice of the Fatherland to declare that the des-*
tlnies of America shall for four years more be
intrusted to the great son born cf the Union
of the two empire States.
I do not belittle the Influence of a father
when I say that if the Iron In a son's nature
be dsrlved from him the gold Is coined from
â¢ the heart of the mother whose lap has cradled
him. And- because 1 believe this, because the
lesson at .tlffe mother's knee Is the seed that
send* a stalk toward heaven and opens far
up Its auxiliary blossoms in the morning light,
because the lofty ideals of manhood are rooted
deeper than youth, because that which a man
Instinctively would be has been dreamed for
him in advance by a mother, I claim for
Georgia the large share In the man you hava
chosen your leader.
Do you name corporate legislation? The op
position resisted and then opposition-* votes
helped to enact it. ' . .
Do you name the canal-*-tbat largest w/trk
of centuries, the eternal " wedding â¢ of . oceans,
dhrlnklng the circumference of the globe, mak
ing distant peoples neighbors, advancing- for
ever civili sat km all around the world? This
historic undertaking in the interest of all the
race, planned by American statesmanship, to
be wrought by American hands. - to stand
through tht- ages protected by the American
flajr: this vast achievement which will endure
While he Is President peace with every na
tion will be preserved at any cost, excepting
only the sacrifice of American rights; and the
vigor with which be maintains the*e will be
itself a guarantee of peace.
The American people will elect him because,
in a word, they know that he does things the
people want done; does things, not merely dis
cusses them â does things oÂ«ly Â¦Â¦â¢'-discussing
them â fcut does things; and does only those
things the people would have him do.- 'This Is
characteristically American; for wherever he
is, the American la he who achieves.
On every question all men know where lie
stands. Americans, frank themselves, demand
franknees. In their servants. Uncertainty is
the death of business. The people can always
get along If they know where they are and
whither they are going. v
His past Is his proof. Every great measure
of his administration was so wise that, en
thusiastically sustained by his own' party, it
won votes even from the opposition.
Do you name Cuban reciprocity?. The oppo
sition resisted and thÂ«n opposition votes helped
to ratify It.
They know that while he is President the
flag will "stay put, V and no American ad
vantage In the I'aciflc or the world be sur
rendered. Americans never retreat. :
.While he is President no wrong-doer (n the
service of the Government will go unwhipped
of justice. Americans demand honesty and
honor, vigilance and fearlessness. ' '
When ha ia President readjustment of tariff
schedules will be made only in harmony with
the principle of protection. Americans have
memories.
Theodore Roosevelt is a leader who leads;
because he carries out the nettled purposes of
the people. Our President's plans, when
achieved, are always found to be merely the
nation's will accomplished. And that la why
the people will elect him.
They will elect him because they know that
If be is President we will get to work and keep
at work on the canal. After decades of delay
when the people want a thing done, they want
it done.
The people's thought is hi* thought: Ameri
can idealt;, hie ideals. This is his only -chart
of t.taleKmanfihipâ and no other is safe. For
the truest guide an American President can
have is the collective intelligence and massed
morality of the American people. And this an
cient rule of the fathers is the rule or our lead
ers now.
CHICAGO, June 23. â Senator Bever
idge of Indiana seconded the nomina
tion of President Roosevelt in the fol
lowing ppeech:
Gentlemen of the Convention: One differ
ence between the opposition and ourselves Is
this: They select their candidate for the peo
ple, and the pt-ople (-elect our candidate for u*.
This was true four yearn ago when we ac
cepted the people's Judgment and named Wil
liam McKlnley. whose perfect mingling of mind
and heart, of wisdom and of tenderness won
tne 'trust and love of the nation then and
makes almost holy hU memory now. His
power was in the people's favor, his shrine is
In the people's hearts.
It is tru<Â« Ui-day when we again accept the
people's judgment and name Theodore Rocse
velt. whose sympathies are as wide as the re
public, whose courage, honesty and vision meet
all emergencies,, and the sum of whose quali
ties make him the .type of twentieth century
Americanism. And the twentieth century
American is nothing more than the man of '7U
facing a new day with the old faith.
â¢Theodore Roojfevelt, like William McKlnley,
is the nominee oX the' American fireside. So
were Washington and Jefferson in the early
time; Â«o was Andrew Jackson when he said
"The Union; it must be preserved"; so was
Abraham Lincoln when, the republic saved, he
bade us "bind up the nation's wounds"; and
Grant when, from victory** very summit his
lofty words, "Let us have peace," voiced the
spirit of the hour and the people's prayer.
When nominated by parties, each of these great
Presidents was. at the periods named, already
chosen by the public judgment. Ana so to-day
the Republican party, whose strength is in its
obedience to the will of the American people,
merely executes again the decree which comes
to it from the American home In naming Theo
dore Roosevelt as our candidate.

fields, consecrated to freedom with the blood
of your brave sons. We ore the -custodians
of your patriot dead.- and each year commem
orate their deeds and decorate their graves
with flowers. In their names and by their
memories the dltepfranchlsed South appeals to
you for Justice. Shall It be said that your
sons marched and fought and died in vain?
Shall it be said that) a -nation can exist part
slave and part free-? Are people free who are
forced to bear the burden and yet denied the
highest privilege of citizenship? If It be true
that warrant may .not be found in the en>
stltutlon to prevent dlsenfranchlsement, then
vi beg that you no longer permit the dis
franchised and- oppressed to be estimated for
the purpose of increasing the electoral strength
of their oppressors. Â¦
Though the grape ts crushed* and the grain
Ik ground, they produce neither wine nor bread
for the persecuted men of the South.
Surrounded by difficulties, striving In vain
to be free, they instinctively turn to the brave,
true man who .has said that he would not close
the door of. hope oh a struggling race. The
Southern Republicans are devoted to him 'and
will follow him with all the affection and eo
thustasm with which the "old guard" fol
lowed Napoleon. They have unshaken faith in
his superb courage, evenhasded Justice . and
unsullied honor. Â¦ Â¦ ' ' . â¢
CHICAGO, June 23. â Governor
Bradley of Kentucky sa.'d a few un
kind things about the Democratic
party in his speech seconding the
nomination of Theodore Roo3evelt.
He spoke as follows:
The Republican party has made no mistakes;
therefore it has no apologies to offer. It has
broken no promises; therefore it enters no plea
of confession and avoidance. It offers no guar
anty for the future save the record of Its past.
It points to an enormously increased com
merce at home and abroad.; to free homes
given to free people; to a war waged to drive
the tyrant from Cuba and a promise faith,
fully kept to give to thu army and navy
whose deeds of valor have added lmperishabie
glory to American arms; to the erection of
churches -and schoolhouses and the Inauguration
of civil government in the Philippines; to the
Universal prosperity now prevailing throughout
the republic; to a generous system of pensions,
provided for those who fought and the families
of those who died, that the Union might be
preserved; to the gigantic Rebellion of all time
courageously met and completely subdued; to
the shackles of bondmen melted in the red
flames of war and to stars preserved and yet
others fixed in the firmament of freedom.
We cannot stand at the base of Bunker Hill
monument, as prophesied by Toombs, and call
the 'roil of our slaves; but we can stand on
any spot on earth and call the long roll of
Republican statesmen and .soMlers â the most
distinguished and Illustrious that the nation
has produced, who rendered Impossible the ful
fillment of that prediction. .
For nearly half a century the record of the
Republican party has been so Interwoven with
the country's history that, each Is a part of
tho other, and neither can.be written without
including the other. Indeed, during that time
the Republican party has been the country.
In diplomacy. In progress. In the arts anl
science*, in prosperity and adversity, in peace
and war. at home and abroad, on land and
sea. the Republican party has been true to
every trust, equal to every emergency, has
continually elevated and advanced the standard
of American Â¦ honor and glory, and now pro
claims, to the world that In th>3 lexicon of pa
triotic endeavor and achievement there is no
euch ' word as fall.
HAS RESISTED ADVANCEMENT.
And during all . these eventful years the
Democratic, party has resisted every step of
advancement and progress. It has been a
stupid objector, a miserable malcontent and a
common scold. For two Presidential terms it
administered public affairs and during each
crippled commerce, unsettled and decreased
values paralyzed Industries, closed manufac
tories and made It necessary for public charity
to provide food for the atarvlnR unemployed.
It has exchanged its time-honored principles
for dangerous heresies and betrayed Its lead
ers, until it Is without a leader and In anxious
search of a platform. It - has abandoned Its
Moses and is unable to discover a Joshua. It
doea not certainly know what It wants; and
If it did. would not know where to find it.
It does not know what it is for, and if It did
would not know how to express It. It does
not know what to do, and if it did would not
know how to .do 'It. Â¦ . ' '
This is the Republican idea of the American
people; this the thought we have when we nom
inate to-day our candidate for the ' nation's
chief; this the quality of Americanism a Re
publican standard bearer must have: And this
is just the Americanism of Theodore Roosevelt.
Full of the old time faith In the republic and
its .destiny: charged with the energy of the
republic's full manhood; cherishing the ordi
nances of the republic's fathers and having In
his heart the fear of God: inspired by the sure
knowledge that the- republic's splendid day is
only in its dawn, Theodore Roosevelt will lead
the American, people In paths of safety to etil.l
greater welfare for themselves;-, etill broader
betterment of the race and to the added honor
of the American name. â¢ .. - . . Â¦ . : Â¦ . . .
American methods changed, but American
character remain* the same. They outlived
the stage coach, nut not the Bible. They ad
vanced, but forgot not their fathers. . They
delved in earth, but remembered the higher,
things. They made highways of the oceans,
but distance and climate altered not their
Americanism. They began as children of lib
erty, and children of liberty they remain. They
began as servants of the Father of Lights,
and hU servants they remain. ! And .so
Into their hands iÂ» dally given more power
and opportunity that they may work- even
larger righteousness in the world and scatter
over ever widening fields the blessed seeds of
human happiness.
Wonderful beyond prophecy's forecast their
progress, noble beyond th" vision of desire
their future. In ISO! Jefferson said, "the
United States (then) had room enough for our
descendants to the thousandth and thousandth
generation" ;' three generations behold the
oceans our boundaries. Washington ' never
dreamed of railways. .To-day electricity and
strain make Maine and 'California, household
neighbors. This advance, which no seer could
have foretold, we made because we arc Amer
icans â because a free people with unfettered
minds and unquestioning belief Joyfully faced
the universe of. human possibilities. These
possibilities are not exhausted; we have hardly
passed their boundaries/ The American people
are not exhausted: we have only tested our
strength. God's work for us In the world Is
not finished: his future missions for the Amer
ican people will be grander than any he has
glvÂ»n us. nobler than we now can comnrehend.
And these tasks as they come, we will accept
and accomplish as our fathers accomplished
theirs. And when our generation shall have
passed and our children shall catch from our
aging hands- the standard we . have borne, it
will still be the old â¢ flag Bf . Yorktown and
Appomattox and Manila Bay; the music to
which they In their turn will then move on
ward will still be the strains that cheered the
dying Warren on Bunker Hill and Inspired the
men who answered Lincoln'* call; and the
Ideals that will hÂ» In them triumphant as they
are In us will still, be the old ideals that have
made the American people great and honored
among the nations of the earth.- â¢â¢ " Â¦ :
. Of what measure of Theodore Roosevelt's
administration doe* the opposition dare even
to propose the repeal? And when has the
record of any President won greater approval?
And no the people trust him as a statesman.
Better than that, they love him as a man. He
wins admiration in vain who wins not affection
also. In the American home â that temple of
happiness and* virtue where dwell the wives
and mothers of the republic, cherishing the
beautiful in life and guarding the morality of
the nation â In the American home the name
of Theodore Roosevelt Is not only honored but
beloved. And that is a greater triumph than
the victory of battlefields, greater credit than
successful statesmanship, greater honor than
the Presidency Itself would be without it. Life
holds no reward so noble as the confidence and
Jove of the American people.
The American people! The mightiest force
fdr good the ages have evolved. They began
as children of liberty. They believed in God
and his providence. They took truth and
Justice and tolerance as their eternal ideals
and marched fearlessly forward. Wildernesses
stretched before them â they subdued them.
Mountains rose â they crossed them. Deserts
obstructed â they passed them. â¢ ThÂ«lr faith
failed them not and a continent was theirs. 1
From ocean to ocean cities rose, fields blos
soined. railroads ran; but every where church
and school were permanent proof that the
principles of their origin were the life of their
maturity.
when our day shall have become ancient, and
which alone Is enough to make the name of
Theodore UooFfcvelt Illustrious through all time
â this fulfillment of the republic's dream ac
complished by Republican effort, finally re
ceived voifs even from an opposition that had
tried to thwart it.
In Kentucky we' have "contended against
principalities and oowers and the rulers of
darkness." We have. In truth, fought with
all manner of hearts, not at Ephesus, but at
Ftankfort. We are nerving ourselves for the
coming .conflict and In November next we
hope to break the chains which partisan legis
lation has thrown around us and restore free
dom to the State which gave birth to Abraham
Lincoln and holds within its bosom the ashes
of Henrv Clay.
He was born to fulfill a mission. That
mission in part accomplished will be com
pleted in coming years, and his name shall
go rinsing down the centuries with htose of
the immortal few "who were not born to
die."
He boldly and fearlessly advances: he never
sounds the retreat. Imbued with never-falling
courage, combined with sound and conserva
tive Judgment; brilliant as a meteor, yet
steady and certain as the sun in its course;
gifted with broad and intelligent statesman
ship; fixed in lofty purpose, he is the em
bodiment of American ideas, American vigor
and the most exalted type of American man
hood. \
He has not been the- pliable instrument of
any man or set of men. He is the creator,
not the creature of public sentiment. He is
not controlled by popular clamor, but hews
to the line, let the chips fall where they may.
He Is not a laggard, a time-server or an Idle
dreamer. He loses no opportunity on account
of timid doubt or annoying hesitation. He is
not a follower, but every Inch a leader. He
is not an imitator, but thoroughly original,
guided alone by a clear conception of right
and the xenius of common sense.
NO PLIABLE INSTRUMENT.
. His enemies eay that he is unsafe. His
reSord proves that he is unsafe only to the
lawless, the trickster, the" grafter, and those
who deny equal protection of the law to any
class of American citizens. But in the dis
charge of the great trusts devolved upon him,
he has proven a harbor of safety.
His enemies predicted that he would in
volve the nation in war; but all his victories
have been thesea/jf diplomacy and peace, and
to-day he enjoys the respect and friendship of
every foreign power.
His enemies say that he cannot be trusted;
but the people know that one who always does
thÂ»- righ; thins at the right time and in the
right way is entitled to their Implicit confi

He knows how and when to plan and, bet

There Â«re many new names Jn these days,
fcut the republican party needs no new title!
It elands now where it stood at the beginning
Memory alone Is needed to tell the source from
which the Inspirations of the country flow.
A drowsy memory would be as guilty now as
a sleeping watchman when the enemy is astir.
The name of the Republican party stands over
even' door where a righteous cause m-as born.
Its members have gathered around every move
ment, no matt-r how weak, if Inspired by high
rÂ«*solvc. ItÂ« flag for more than fifty years has
been the Â«lgn of hope on t-very spot where
liberty was the wcrd. That party needs no
new name or platform to designate its pur
poses. It is now as it has been, equipped,
militant and in motion. The problem* of every
age that age munt solve. Great causes im
pose great demanl*. but nÂ«ver In any enter
prise have the American necple failed, and
never in any crisis has the Republican party
failed to express the conscience and intelligence
cf that people.
The public mind is awake both to Us oppor
tunities and Its dangers. Nowhere in the
world, in any era. did citizenship mean more
thc.% tt means to-day In America, Men of
courage and sturdy character are ranging
themselves together with a unanimity seldom
seen. There is no excuse for groping In the
dark, for the light is plain to him who will
but raise his eyes. The American people be-
Iie\-Â» in a man or party that has convictions
â¢ nd knows why. They believe that what ex
pericne* has proved it is idfe to resist. A
wise man is any fool about to die. But there
U a wisdom which with good fortune may
fruide the living and the ' strong. That wis
dom Fprings from reason, observation and ex
perience. Guided by these, this thing is plain,
Â«.ad young men may rely upon It. that the
fcietory and purposes T have described, rising
Â»vrn to the etmence and aspirations of patriot
inn, find their best concrete example In the
career and doctrines of the Republican party.
But not aJone opoa thÂ« principles of that
NEEDS NO NEW TITLE.
OXE FUNDAMENTAL. PLANK.
When all the people have forgotten will
Â«1awn a golden era for this new Democracy.
Uut the country 1st not ready- yet* to place a
party In the lead whose most expressive motto
is the cheerlees word "forget." That motto
nay expres* contrition, but it does not inspire
bo:*. Neither confidence nor enthusiasm will
ever be aroused by any party which enters
t-ach campaign uttering the language of the
mourner.
.There is one fundamental plank, however.
en which the two great parties are in full
.agreement. Both believe in the equality of
tnrn. The difference is that the Democratic
party would make every man as low as the
poorest, white the Republican party would
make every men an high as the best. But
the Democratic course will proveke no outside
interference now, for the Republican motto
is that of the great commander, "never inter
rupt the enemy while he Is making a mistake"
In politics as in other field?, the most im
presslve arguments epring from ' contract.
Â»ver has there been a more striking example
of unity than is now afforded by this assem
blage. You are gathered here not as 'fac
tions torn by discordant views, but moved by
one desire and intent, you have come as the
chosen representatives of the most enlightened
party In the world. You meet not as strangers,
for no men arc- strangers who held the same
beliefs and espouse the same cause. You
may separate two bodies of water for a thou
Â»*nJ years, but when once the barrier is re
moved they mingle lnrtantly and are one.
The same traditions inspire and the same pur
poses actuate us all. Never in our lives did
these purposes Â¦ stand with deeper reot than
now. At least two generations have passed
eway Â«lnoe the origin of that great movement
from which sprang the spirit which has been
the leading impulse in American politics for
half a century. In that movement,. which was
both a creation and an example, were those
great characters which endowed the Republican
party at Its birth with the attributes of Jus
tice, muality and progress, which have held
It to thla hour in line with the highest senti
ment* of mankind. From th^i-e men we have
Inherited the desire, and to their memory we
ewe the resolution, that those great schemes
of government and humanity, inspired by their
patriotism, and established by thefe blood,
i>hall remain as the fixed and permatent em
blem of their labors, and the abiding signal
cf the liberty and progress of the race.
CHICAGO, June 23. â The conven
tion was in a flutter of animation
xvhen ex-Governor Frank Black of
New York advanced to the front of
the platform to place in nomination
The name of President Roosevelt.
As he confronted the convention
Governor Black presented a striking
ligure. He is tall and gaunt. His
hair, originally a dark brown, is. lib
erally streaked with gray, his dark
e\es look sharply from behind spec
tacles and from beneath closely over
hanging eyebrows.
His voice well; his " epi
grams orovoked laughter and the
sharply turned sentences never failed
to raise a rip:>le of applause.
He spoke as follows:
Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Conven
tion: We are here to inaugurate a campaign
vhich seems already to be nearly closed. So
wisely have the people sowed and watched and
tended, there teems little now tQ do but to
measure up the grain. They are ranging them
relves not for battle but for harvest. In one
f:!nmii reaching from the Maine woods to the
PaWCt Round are those people and those States
whichÂ« have stood so long together, that when
great emergencies arise the nation turns in
t-iinctlvely t-> thf-m. In thin column, vast and
tclid, 1? a majority so overwhelming that the
mattered squads In opposition can hardly raise
another army. The enemy has neither guns
nor ammunition, and if they had they would
use them on each other. Destitute of the
weapons of effective warfare, the only evi
dence of approaching battle is in the tone and
number of their bulletins. There is discord
among the generals; discord among the- soldiers.
r.ach v.-oaid fight in his cwn way. but before
assaulting h'.s Republican adwrearies he would
first destroy his own comrades in the adjoining
tÂ«*nts. Kach believes the weapons chot\.n by
the other are not only wicked but fatal to the
li. : ii-r. That is true. This is the only war
of modern tim^s wfcere the boomerang has been
substituted tor the gun. Whatever fatalities
may occur, however, among the discordant
hosts now moving en St. Louts, no harm will
come this fall to the American people. There
will be no opposition sufficient to raise & con
flict. There will be hardly encugh for compe
tition. There are no. Democratic plans for the
conduct of the fall campaign. Their zeal is
chiefly centered in discussion as to what
Thorr.se JtiTcrson would on if he were living.
He ia not living, and but few of his de
scendants are among the Democratic remnants
of to-day. Whatever of patriotism or wisdom
emanated from that di*t:ninjtshÂ«d man is now
represented in this convention.
It Is a cad day for any party when its
only means ol y< )\ ir>- living issues is by t'Jess
ing et the possible attitude of a statesman
who is dead. This condition leave* that party
â¢Jwajn a beginner and makes every question
new. The Democratic party has seldom tried
a problem en its own account, and when it
hts Its blunders have ben its only monu
ments, its courage is remembered only In
regret.- As long as these things are repealled
that party may oerve as ballast, but it will
sever steer the ship.
We want this younger Lincoln â the keeper of
our great eagle â we wanted him with hlÂ» han.ls
on the halyard* of our flag; we want him thÂ«
defender of our constitution and the executive
of our law. and when we have used him ant
the best years of his young. manhood for th-!
good of the nation, he will still be holding our
banner of liberty with stars added' to its azura
field, its history sacred, its stripea untarnlshe-1.
and. by command of the majority, hand it to
the American patriot standing next In line.
The hlesslngs of this great work cannot b<>
told In words, and figures win get wobbly and
unsteady with the load when you chalk them on
the blackboard of time.
Barnacle bottomed ships of the great salt
sea will greet the great father of waters and
make every town on his banks a maritime city.
Tho owners of the farm, factory and mine will
become familiar with the names they never
knew and write strange addresses on the ex
ports they send across the unharvested ocean.

WILL KNOW NEW NAMES.
From a Democratic point of view, he Is a
weird magician of politics. They charged him
with disrupting a government on the isthmus,
creating a republic and unlawfully conniving
at a canal. They awoke one flne morning to
find the republic of Panama an entity. Its exist
ence recognized by foreign nations and Con
gress paying out millions of dollars to ratify
his strategic promptness. He wanted to give
Uncle Sam a Job and he did It. and Uncle Sam
wanted the Job and he took It. He belongs to
the Union. We see him standing to-day with
his feet upon the * spade, his garments are
made of his flag, his Inventive Yankee whiskers
are brushed, there Is an American smile on his
face and his heart la gladdened aa he looks at
the golden sunrise of bis commercial future.
Dishonesty, cowardice and duplicity are never
impulsive; Roosevelt la Impulsive; so be It â he
Is different.
Our tree is big and broad and grand: we
want a President typical of the country: ore
who will preserve her history, enforce her law,
teach Americanism and fight the wrong.
Theodore Roosevelt, thcu art the man. TI>!1
may he be proud. He is young: the prl*s of
life ig his, and time Is on his side. He lovej
the whole country and knows no fa\-orite sec
tion: he has performed his sacred promise: he
has kept the faith with McKlnley's memorv
and now faces responsibilities of his own. He
hypnotizes obstacles, looks them In the eye and
overpowers with self -conscious honesty of par
pose.
How like unto our emblem of freedom h+
has cropped off the young twigs of our ceda.
of liberty and carried them across the ocean
to the land of traffic and set them In th
city of merchants. The seed of our land :s

Tb.ua said the Lord: A great eagle, with
great wings, long winged and full of feather*,
which had divers colors, came unto Lebanon

Gentlemen of the Convention: Geography

The time Is ripe for brightening up Ameri

men and women of America and many oiU
ones may know what a prlrÂ» has been paid
for the liberty. r>eace an<l union they enjoy
through the- devoted patriotism of our sfK-nt
heroes of the past. Deprivation and sacrifice
already endured for many years before the
old bell in the Statehouse was given the
voice to apeak the glorious sentiment of the
age and proclaim liberty throughout all thÂ»
land, and they were made the Instruments
by which the principles productive of our
national grandeur were set aa Jewels In our
public's coronet. What we prayed for. fought
for. bled for aftd died for. we want cared for
Telegraph the world that the Kepublicari
party was the first organization that beckoned
the laboring man to hlÂ» feet and made him
know the quality and equality of his truÂ»
Â¦elf. It showed him the possibilities of honest
poverty and has withheld nothing from his
worthy ambition. It took a rall-splltter from
the ground J5Aor of a log cabin and set him
with the stars.
His speech was of Just the right
length and his every sentence forcible
and to the point.
"We have outgrown the continent
and are peopling the Isles of the sea"
was his summing up of the question of
expansion. !
He painted a graphic picture of thÂ»
results of the opening of thÂ« Panama
canal, and in leading up to his plea for
Roosevelt said: "We want for Presi

CHRONOLOGICAL
REVIEW OF LIFE
OF FAIRBANKS
CHICAGO, June 23.â In a bright,
characteristic speech Senator Chaun
cey M. Depew paid a tribute to the
worth of Charles W. Fairbanks.
A remark from a delegate, "Have you
had your dinner?" was selected by the
Senator and used as a text. He said:
My friend wants to know if I have had my
dinner. . But' what I am about to fay is In
behalf of dinners for the American people.
I cannot help contrasting. In listening to the
eloquence with which we have been privileged,
what -will be the difference when our Demo
cratic friends meet on the 6th of July to go
through their duty of nominating candidates
and adopting a platform. We here have been
unanin:ou3 upon our candidates, all agreed
upon our candidates, all agreed upon our prin
ciple?, on recognizing and applauding our
statesman living and dead and agreeing with
them; .Trhlle on the other hand In contrast
there will be only two living exponents of
Democratic principles.
On the one side will be their only President
rising and saying, "Ce sane," while on the
other aide In opposition wlil come their last
candidate for President; saying "Be Demo
crats."
The two are Incompatible.
I present just two thoughts which It seems
to me in the flood of our oratory have been
passed by. There has been criticism of this
convention that it was without enthusiasm,
perfunctory, and would occupy little place in
history. But this convention Is an epoch
making convention, becaune It marks the close
of fifty years or the life of the Republican
party. That fifty years. If we should divide
time into periods of history, the fifty years
frona lv'l to 19OI would concentrate more than
has been done in this world for the uplifting
of humanity than all the half centuries that
have preceded.
Now, my friends, while we present the posi
tive, thÂ» convention which meets on the 6t!> of
July presents that element hitherto unknown la
American politics â opportunist. It watts for
bankruptcy; It is waiting for panic, for Indus
trial depression; waiting for financial distress.
There was an old farmer on the coast of
Maine who owned a farm with a rocky ledge
Tunning out into the ocean called Hurricane
Pc!nt. On it ships were wrecked, and he gath
ered his harvest from Its rocks, and in his will
he wrote: "I divide my farm equally among
my children, but Hurricane Point shall be kept
for all of you lorever, for, while the winds blow
and the waves roll, the Lord will provide."
But we have put a light upon Hurricane Point,
a lighthouse of - protection, with a revolving
light shedding gold over the ocean, and Ameri
can commerce going and coming Is absolutely
safe.
And now. gentlemen, my second thought. It
seems to me that we have not given enough
Importance to the office of Vice President of
the United States. It was not so among the
fathers. Then of the two highest potential fig
ures, one took the Presidency, the other the
Vice Presidency. But in the last forty years
ridicule and caricature have placed the office
almost in, contempt. Let us remember that
Thomas Jefferson; let us remember that old John
Adams; let u* remember that John Calhoun and
George Clinton and Martin Van Buren were
Vlrc Presidents c( the United States.
Everybody knows that If the tower-
Ing figure of Theodore Roosevelt would have
been out of the canvas one of the promising
candidates before v the convention for President
of the United States would have been Charles
Fairbanks, and New York, appreciating his
great ability as a lawyer and appreciating the
name he has made for himself as Senator, ap
preciating his dignity, his character and his
genius for public affairs, seconds the nomina
tion of Charles W. Fairbanks for Vice Presi
dent of the United States. (Prolonged applause
and cheers.) . . :
CHICAGO, Juns 23 Senator J. P.
Dolliver of Iowa presented to the con
vention the name of Charles W. Fair
banks as the party's nomines for th'Â«
office of Vice President. He said:
Gentlemen of the convention: The National
Republican Convention, now nearly ready to
adjourn, has presented to the world a moral
spectacle of extraordinary interest and sig
nificance. It Is a fine thing to see thousands
of men, representing millions of people, fight
ing Â»n the political arena for their favorit*
candidates and contending valiantly for the
success ot contradictory principles and con
flicting doctrines. Out of. such a contemt, with.
Its noise and declamation, ita flying banners,
its thunder of the captains and the shouting,
truth often secures a vindication, and th*
right man comes out victorious. Sometimes,
however, wisdom Is lost In the confusion, and
more than once we have seÂ«n the claims of
leadership swallowed up In contention and
strife.
We have the honor to belong to a conTen
tion whose constituency in every State and
Territory and In the islands of the sea has
done its thinking by quiet firesides, undis
turbed by clamor of any sort, and has simpli
fied our. responsibilities by the unmistakable
terms of the credentials which we hold at their
hands.
At Intervals of four years I followed the
banner of .Tames G. Blalne through the street
of our convention cities, from Cincinnati to
Minneapolis and did my full share to see that
nrbody got any more applause than the g^reat
popular leader who had captured my enthusi
asm long before I was old enough to vote.
Not even his defeat serred. to diminish the
bold which our champion had upon the hearts
of those who followed him. and It has required
a good deal of experience to enable them to
understand the lesson of his defeat. 0ther
conventions have met to settle the fate of
rival chieftains; we meet to record the judg
n'tnt of the Republican cU!!iora of the Vnited
States.
They have based their opinion upon th*
facts of the case. They have not concluded
that we have the greatest President of tlrÂ»
Uniu-d States since Washington. They know
how to measure the height and depth of things
better ev?n than Professor Bryce when he
deals with the superlatives which find their
way Into all well regulated banquets after
midnight. They have not forgotten the gravÂ»
of Lincoln, which has become a shrine of pil
grimage of the human race. They remember
still the day when the canon of Westminster
opened the doors of that venerable monument
to admit the name of the silent American
soldier into the household of English-spoken
fame.
CAREER OF ROOSEVELT.
They have passed no vainglorious Judgment
upon the career of Theodore Roosevelt. They
have studied It with sympathetic interest from
his boyhood a* he has risen from one season
of public usefulness to another until at length,
before the age of 45, he stands upon the high
est civic eminence known amonic men. ThÂ«:r
heads fell with his aa he stood In the shadow
of McKlnley's death and as part of his oath
of office asked the trusted counselors who
stood by the side of the fallen President to
help him carry forward the work which he
had left unfinished, and while his administra
tion deserves the tribute which It received in
this convention from th? eloquent lips of, our
temporary chairman, it is because he has exe
cuted in a manly way the purpose of the Re
publican party and interpreted aright the as
pirations of t*te American people. Nor can
there be a doubt that If tn the years to come M
shall walk steadfastly in the same path hÂ»
will bÂ» numbered among the great leaders of
the people who have given dignity and influ
ence to their highest office.
But t*>e Judgment of the Republican party
Is not enly united upon Its candidate â It is
unanimous also upon the fundamental princi
ples far which It stan>Is. I think the con
vention has been fortunate In harmonizing th
minor differences which unavoidably arise in a
country Ike ours, where speech is free and
where Drlntlnr iÂ» freÂ». We stand tocstber on
the oroDoaltion that the Industrial system of
the United States* must not b- undermine*! by
a hostile partisan agitation, and that what
ever chanites are necessary in our laws ought
to be made by the, friends, or at !ea*t the
acquaintances, of the protective tariff system.
The things upon which we are agreed are Â»o
great and the thing* about which we differ are
so funall that we are able, without sacriflcinx
sincere Republican convictions anywhere, ta
unite As one m3n in uâ¬iÂ£-nft9 o* our com m Â¦ > n
faith.
ROLIi CALIi A REMINDER.
The roll call of this convention Is a reminder,
not without it* melancholy suggestion, that the
veterans of Republican leadership are transfer
ring the responsibilities which they hav* borne
to the generation born since 1SCO. The children
of the men who laid the foundations of the re
publican party are here to bÂ»sln th> celebra
tion of Ita fiftieth anniversary. A heavy hanÂ«l
has been laid since we met at Philadelphia
upon the men who guide tie counsels of the
party.
Nelson Dingier, whose nan* Is associated In
Immortal reputation with the Industrial am!
commercial miracles which opened the new
century. iÂ» gone, and within the borders of the
same Stats lies all that Is mortal of Thomas
B. Re*d.- who put an end to anarchy In th*
American House of Rmresentatives. Dear
Uncle Mark. Hanna. whose face has locksd
down witb the benediction of an old frten.il
upon cur deliberations, we shall see no mare.
Wthin the past few days we burled Matthew
Stanley Quay in the bosom of the common
wealth which he loved, and which, tn spite
of the malice and calumny which pursued him
while he lived, never failed In its affectionate
confidence in him. while over the whole four
years has hune the shadow of our national
affliction which left the American oeoele in
sackcloth and ashes.
We stand at the beginning of the new era.
and while the Republican party leans upon
the counsel of Its old leaders it has not hesi
tated to summon to the responsibilities of
public life the young men who have been
trained under their guidance to take up the
burdens which they are rrady to lay down
and finish the work which comes to them
a* an Inheritance of patriotism and duty.
That is the significance of the nomination
of Theodore Roosevelt and that Is the ex
planation of the call which has been made
by the Republican party, without a dissenting
voice, upon Charles W. Fairbanks to 'stand
by the side of the President in the guidance
and leadership of the Republican party.
FREE FRO3I AFFECTATION*.
- While he has not sought to constrain thÂ»
Judgment of the convention directly or in
directly, he has kept himself free from thÂ»
affectation which undervalues the dignity of
the second office in the gift of the American
people, and I do not dcubt that his heart ha*
been touched by the voluntary exsression of
universal good will which has already chosen
him aa one of the standard bearers of the
Republican party of the Cnlted States. ThÂ»
office has sought the man and he will brlnjr
to the office the commanding personality of a
statesman equal to any of the great responsi
bilities wWch belong to â - public affair*.
A leader of the Senate, the champion of all
the great policies which constitute the In-
Tlndble. record of the Republican party dur
ing the last ten years, his name will become
a tower of strength to our cause, not only in
his own State, but everywhere throughout the
country. x a man of affairs, the whole business
community shares the confidence which hia
political associates have reposed In him from
the beginning of his public life. The quiet.
undemonstrative, popular opinion which has
given the Republican party a platform upon
ton of Minnesota seconded the nom-Â»
ination of Roosevelt. His conclud
ing words seconding- the name of
"that great doer of things, Theodore
Roosevelt," was warmly applauded.
Prolonged applause greeted the in
troduction of Harry S. Cummings, %.
colored delegate from Maryland.
Cannon introduced him as "an Ameri
can, citizen, whose people were
brought from slavery forty years ago,
and who had made more progress in
one generation than any other race
had ever before made."
An ovation was given Cummings
when he closed his speech.
VOTE CAST BY STATES.
Cannon then advanced to the front
of 'the rostrum and at 1:19 o'clock
announced the roll-call for the nom
ination for President. The clerk be
gan calling the roll by States. When
Alabama, responded with .her entire
vote for^Itoosevelt there was a cheer.
The States followed in alphabetical
order, and %v as each response ended
with the-words "Theodore Roosevelt,"
the cheering was renewed.
An effort was made by New Jersey
to suspend further calling of the roll,
but the convention protested loudly.
Senator Platt of New York was on
his feet to make the announcement
for . his State, and when his State
Â¦was called the convention became en
thusiastic at the announcement.
Texas also got a cheer as' C. A.
Boynton made the announcement for
Roosevelt.
Â¦ Oklahoma's response was six votes
"for the next State on the banner of
the republic."
Chairman Cannon announced at
the conclusion of the roll-call that
Theodore Roosevelt had received .the
entire vote of : the convention, 994,
and -it- only remained for him to an
nounce, his nomination for the Presi
dency by the Republican party.
\ , The enthusiasm following . the an
nouncement of the chairman was of
briefer duration than that which fol
lowed the first call, but the cheering
lasted_t\vo minutes. Then Mr. Cannon
announced:
.S.'lThe', clerk will call the roll for pre
sentation of candidates for Vice Presi
dent.".
FAIRBANKS' XAME PRESENTED.
,. "Alabama," called the clerk.
. Hundley of Alabama announced that
his" State desired to waive its right in
favor of the State of Iowa. This meant
Senator. Dolliver, who was to deliver
the first nominating speech of Senator
Fairbanks of Indiana. As the tall
form of Iowa's Junior Senator was seen
pressing toward the platform the cries
and shouts broke out and they were
redoubled in violence when Chairman
Â¦Cannon led forward Senator Dolliver
arid spoke a few words of introduction.
The first mention of Fairbanks' name
was. the signal for cheers, which were
renewed -when Dolliver formally ' pre
sented the name of the Indiana Sen
ator. â¢-" '
When -the applause subsided Cannon
recognized Senator Depew.whose ap

The California delegation, -with the
great gold banner and a' cornet player
of uncertain powers, who took liberties
with "A Hot Tlme*ln the Old Town To-
Night." .started on. a. brief .parade, but
ft was soon over and Chairman Can
non announced the .next speaker, as
"Mr. Stillwell of Georgia." There^were
loud cries of "Edwards," and Cannon
was informed that the . name . of the
Knight was surrounded by an enthu
siastic vthrong as he left the platform,
Senator Scott of West Virginia throw
ing his arms around him and hugging
him enthusiastically.
PARADE OF OAMFORNTANS.
Again Knight touched the responsive
chord when he exclaimed, speaking of
the beginnlg of the Panama canal:
"Theodore Roosevelt gave Uncle Sam
a Job. Uncle Sam wanted it: and he
took it. and Uncle Sam belongs to tho
Union, too." â¢ ......
The California delegation showed that
it was prepared for the occasion. The
old stage coach long-drawn, yell, "Wa
hoo," was echoed through the hall, and
a California banner, followed by a huge
wreath of flowers,, was borne through
the. hall as Knight .was proceeding to
the platform.
Knight was introduced by Chairman
Cannon. He had a voice which.pene
trated the farthest recesses of the hall
and rolled back in echoes from the
arched iron roof. As he-^Tan-a voice
from a far end shouted, "Not so loud."
This was a touch which the convention
appreciated, and it gave itself up to a
hearty laugh. â¢ ' ' \ . ...
Knight proved to be a phrasemaker.
"Cowardice,, duplicity and dishonesty
are not impulsive," shouted he. "Theo
dore Roosevelt is Impulsive.. He hyp
notized obstacles." , â¢ ' â¢
"Wahoo!" was again shouted from
the California delegation, and the con
vention took up the cry with laughter
and applause.
"Gentlemen of the convention, I have
the honor of introducing to you a gen
tleman whom you all know, a son of
Indiana, who when he has a message
insists upon a hearing, and when he
speaks the people are enlightened and
enthused."
Senator Beveridge began hl&Â»Â«peech
arnid loud applause. Long before he
concluded Beveridge's coliin was wilted
and the perspiration' was streaming
down his face, but his voice lost none
of its carrying power and his manner
none of its energy. Senator Beveridge's
concluding words, "Indiana seconds the
nomination of Roosevelt," released the
waiting cheer, the band and the flags-
It was short-lived, however, and order
was soon restored.
When the convention had expressed
its appreciation of Indiana's second to
the nomination, Chairman Cannon an
nounced that George A. Knight of Cali
fornia would second the nomination.
KNIGHT SCORES A TRIUMPH.
"It prophesied victory in I860; its life
has been baptized on many battlefields
since and it is safe in the hands of
President Roosevelt^' #
The cheering was renewed, when
Cannon recognized Senator Beverldge
of Indiana, whom he introduced in
these words:
required full/ five minutes and several
more raps by the chairman and stren
uous work of numerous police and ser
geants-at-arms to get the delegates
once more Into their seats.
"When Chairman Cannon had finally
restored order the* secretary read a
history of the flag which Cannon had
been waving. Grasping the flag and
waving it over his head. Cannon said:
REPUBLICAN PARTY'S NOMINEE
TOR THE VICE PRESIDENCY OF
THE NATION.
Din Continues Until Delegates
and Spectators Are Hoarse
â¢ and Exhausted.
Fairbanks Shares With Pres
ident in the Remark
able Ovation.
The applause at this time had con
nued almost twenty-three minutes. It
At this point the band struck up. Its
strains, however, were only l'aintiy dis
cernible in the mighty din. Then Chair
man Cannon took a hand. Unfurling a
tattered silk flag he advanced to the
extreme edge of the platform and be
gan to wave it. The flag is the prop
erty of the Lincoln-McKinley Associa
tion of Missouri, and it made its ap
pearance at a Republican National
Convention in 1SG0, when Lincoln was
nominated. It was then carried by the
Missouri delegation arid was waved
over the platform on that occasion, as
on this. It was fuel for the flame of
enthusiasm and the volume of sound
increased.
The front of the platform was next
occupied by an immense crayon bust
portrait of President Roosevelt,
brought on by three men. This gave
fresh impetus to the shouting.
The front of the stage'was next given
over to a young man with a megaphone
and a. flag. As he swung the banner
from side to side he shouted the name
"Roosevelt." At each swing of the Hag
the name was repeated. It was soon
taken up by the delegates in front,
spread to those in the rear, and in a
twinkling the whole assemblage was
shouting "Roosevelt!" "Roosevelt!" in
measured unison. The young man who
started the cry was J. Henry Smythe
Jr. of Philadelphia, who is prominently
identified with amateur sports.
The Indiana delegation opened um
brellas of red, white and blue, bearing
portraits of Roosevelt and Fairbanks.
The Alaskan totem polos were held
aloft and thousands of flags waved in
a wild sweep of colors.
UPROAR CONTINUES UNCHECKED
The New York delegation, occupying
a place immediately in front, started
out on a marching tour of the hall.
Meanwhile the demonstration showed
no signs of spending itself; five, six and
seven minutes it continued. There was
not the slightest diminution in the v:!
ume of sound.
When the applause had continued al
most seven minutes it was given a new
impetus by Chairman Cannon, who
walked once more to the front carry
ing his large banner. A little girl clad
in white was lifted on the shoulders of
some of the California delegates and
the first sound of her childish treble
was the signal for another outburst.
A delegate requested Chairman Can
non to loan him the large flag he had
carried, and with a smile the chairman
handed it down. Around the hall it
went, followed by a long line of shout
ing delegates.
California, with its great banner of
purple,, white and gold, came march
ing down the center aisle, followed by
Senators, members of Congress and
others prominent in the life of the na
tion. The New York delegation,
catching sight of Henry C. Payne on
the platform, paid him a brief and spe
cial tribute and then returned once
more to the cheering for the candidate,
shouting "RooseveJ* 1 " "Roosevelt!"
"Roosevelt!" "New York!" over and
over again.
A small boy, James Calun of Georgia,
'with long, curling hair, was hoisted
upon the platform and waved in fran
tic fashion a small national flag.
Louise Roberts, the young girl who
had created enthusiasm in the Califor
nia delegation, was next carried up and
down on the shoulders of a stalwart
delegate from Indiana. She created a
new furor of enthusiasm as she tossed
her flag to and fro. Little Naomi Da
foe of Alpena, Mich., followed for a
brief period, and when she had waved
her flag but a' few minutes Chairman
Cannon pushed to the front and, say
ing "Please let me hi, my dear," he
rapped vigorously for order. :.: . .,.

speech.
Governor Black pronounced the
nominating words at 11:06 o'clock.
As he did so he retired quickly from
the platform. But the words. "Theo
dore Roosevelt," had not left his lips
when there was a shout. The con
vention was on its feet. Like the
crash of thunder that followed the
lightning. the enthusiasm began.
Flags were in the air, hats were
thrown up, men jumped on their,
chairs, women stood and shouted. The
air was rent by one continuous, pro
longed shout from thousands â¢ of
throats. So mighty was the volume of
applause that nothing definite in the
way of articulate sound was distin
guishable.

As Governor Black reached the desk
of Chairman Cannon he was warmly
greeted by that gentleman and escorted
down to the front of the platform.
Here Chairman Cannon, standing by
the Kide of Black, In a few words in
troduced him to the convention. There
was a succession of shouts from the
contention hall, a chorus of shrieks
from the New York delegation, a
Then followed the announcement
that the recently elected national com
mittee -would meet in the Coliseum
Annex Immediately on the adjourn
ment of the convention.
IJLACK NOMINATES ROOSEVEIiT.
Chairman Cannon at once an
nounced that the next order of busi
nes would be a roll call of the States
for the nomination of President of the
United Stafes.
The clerk called "Alabama," and Im
mediately Oscar R. Hundley of that
frHate mounted a chair and announced
that Alabama requested the honor
and privilege of yielding its place on
the roll to the State of New York.
Instantly the convention was in an
uproar. The New York delegation was
on its feet Jike one man, waving its
flags and Ehouting wildly. Ex-Gov
ernor Frank Black of New York,
chosen to deliver the nominating
epeecb on behalf of President Roose
velt, immediately started" for the plat
form amid the wildest enthusiasm on
the part of the delgates.
"On the 6th day of July, at Jackson,
Mich., there will be celebrated the fif
tieth anniversary of the birth of the
Republican party (applause), the time
when and the place where it received
its name. Secretary Hay will deliver
the principal address. Senator Fair
banks and others will address the mÂ»et
inpr."
At the conclusion of the prayer Chair
man Cannon presented the following
announcement through the reading
clerk:
The Rev. Thaddeus A- Sniveley, rec
tor of St. Chrysostom's Church, was
presented, and at Cannon's suggestion
advanced to the front of the platform.
As he spread forth his arms to Invoke
divine blessing the convention arose.
The animated hum of conversation
ceased and silence prevailed.
Cannon abandoned the hugre gavel
and evened a handsome leather casket
and took out a small one. With this in
his hand and holding the other up to
command silence he advanced to the
front and ordered the delegates to take
their seats. The command was at once
obeyed.
"The convention will be opened with
prayer," he announced.
At 10: SO o'clock Chairman Cannon,
fielding: the immense wooden gavel in
his left hand, arose from his high
backed leather chair and with a re
eounding whack on the table in front of
him commanded the convention to be
In order.
Cheers greeted the arrival of Chair
man Cannon upon the stage and the
band struk up the national hymn.
This was the signal for the conven
tion to rise and the New York delega
tion was conspicuous, each of its mem
bers waving an American flag.
Just before Chairman Cannon's b!g
cavel fell Mrs. M. E. Plummer of the
American Flag Association came upon
the stage and presented him with a
bunch of calla lilies, which "Uncle Joe"
received with a profound bow.
"Put them in your buttonhole," yelled
some one in the gallery.
They were deposited in a vase on the
chairman's desk, which also held a
large bunch of fresh roses.
For the first time during the conven
tion the presence of a large nunlber of
ladies in light gowns made a brilliant
ecene.
CALLS OOXVEXTIO.V TO ORDER.
Secretary Cortelyou arrived promptly
r-n the stroke of 10 and was escorted
to a scat on the platform. He received
a. cordial preetinp, the members of the
National Committee crowding around
to shake his hand. The Secretary and
Postmaster General Payne stepped to
one Bide f<^r a brief chat before the
convention convened.

fact. By the time the gavel fell every

Jammed to the limit. The delegates,

spectators in their arrival, and the or

Governor Carter of Hawaii, notwith
standing his defeat of yesterday, when
he sought to secure an Increased rep

the convention, was one of the early

though he had secured all he sought

A few minutes before the assemblage
there was a hurried conference by the
managers which resulted in an agree

of Mr. de Young and his family in
Europe the premises have bean under

The smoke was seen issuing- from the
upper portion of the barn, where sev

in the policies of the Republican party, and. the

enormous Democratic majorities, gave 94,000
votes for Bryan and 60.000 for McKlnley;
North "arolina cast 174,000 for Bryan and
155 000 for McKlnley; Virginia gave 154.000
for'Bryan and 135,000 for McKlnley.. And this
was according to Democratic counts. Mary

Georgia and North Carolina In 1900 12 to 15

AGAINST OYSTER HOUSE
The Board of Health met last night
to hear the recommendations made by
the Dairymen's Association in refer
ence to the proposed ordinance regu
lating milking sheds and barns. Con
struction, ventilation' and sanitation
were thoroughly considered.
There were present: President -Dr.
J. W. Ward, Drs. W. R. Harvey. P/J.
Poheim. J. V. Hughes and J. Coplln
fe'tinson, members of the Board of
Health; D. F. Ragan, Health Officer,
and Louis Levy, Deputy Health Of *
fleer. Attorneys E. D. Knight and Col
onel George Pippy, who represented
the Dairymen's Association; some fifty
members of that organization and Dr,
Rupert Blue of the United States Hos
pital Service.
The dairymen and their attorneys
put up a strong fight to have the or
dinance greatly modified. They have
partly succeeded.
In regard to article 1, instead of the
barn being of sufficient size to average
600 cubic feet of air space to each cow.
as required, a compromise was effected
and Â«0 feet or its equivalent was final
ly decided upon. In article 2 the point
about the size of windows brought up
a big discussion. The ordinance called
for windows 4x4 in size at Intervals o|
every six feet. Dairyman John D.
Daly of San Mateo said that windows
of this size would cause half of the
cows in the building: to jump through
them, as he knew from actual experi
ence.
After a long wrangle it was decided
that windows should be 2*^x4 and ul
distances of ten feet or its equivalent.
WA.VT GOOD FLOORS.
Under article 3 the floor must be so
impervious as to admit of no leakage
to the ground beneath, a gutter drain
to carry off discharges and a sewer to
connect therewith to carry the dis
charges 300 feet away from the barn.
Article 4 provides that feed boxes an;
to be so constructed that they can be
hosed out. The question of cleansing
the floors and walls of the stable, as
provided in article 6, was a hard nut to
crack. The board wanted the floors*
flushed every day after each milking
by water under high pressure.
Mr. Daly said this was entirely Im
practicable. The place would never
dry and the slippery floors 'would cause
the cows to fall down right and left.
Dr. Blue said flushing was, a good
thing and he thought the floors should
be flushed daily. He. however,
had never run a cow barn and spoke
from the standpoint of a bacterial ex
pert.
Henry Brewer suggested that lime
Instead of water be introduced.
It was decided that the floors shall
be sprinkled and cleaned once a day in
place of the slushing.
The location of the milk house wu a
bone of contention. In the- course of th.a
discussion Mr. Daly said he wanted to
understand if the board wanted tf>
drive all the milkmen out of business.
Dr. Ward in replying said that the
conditions were such that it was im
perative to have changes and that for
the health and welfare of* the people
they would have to take place. Milk
should hereafter come up to a bac
teriological standard and that was all
there was to it.
POINTS AT ISSUE.
"It Is a marvel to me," said - Mr.
Daly, "that if conditions are aa you
say that any one Is living In Califor
nia at present."
Dr. Ward retorted: "There are not
as many living as have a right to live,
and if we had pure milk they would
be living. It la in order to' protect
those who cannot protect themselves
that we are taking these measures."
The provisions are as follows:
The milkhouse. according- to article I, thaU
be In a arrarate building.
â¢ Article II â Screens moit bÂ« put orer all
windows and doors.
Article III â The milk must be taken to thÂ»
mlikhouse in a covered call.
Article IV â Vats and ether receptacles uaeÂ£
to cool milk shall be of wood or of cement.
Article V says the milkbouse shall be waahed 1
out dally.
Article VIâ Helpers who handle milk shall
be personally clean.
F. F. Piant, owner of the Piant Farm
Dairy, . situated near Vallejo, states
that if the proposed ordinance was
passed he would be driven out of busi
ness. The provisions of the ordinance
would cause the production of milk to
almost double in price, hence the con
sumer in San Francisco, who 13 now
paying 8 1-3 cents a quart, will prob
ably be compelled to pay about 15 cents.
Great stress was laid In the
meeting on the subpject of the
Hotaling Model Dairy, which was
said to be nearest up to the standard
of the proposed ordinance. Mr. Daly
stated that he understood the Hotaling
dairy was losing $10,000 a year. -
The committee did not adjourn until
2:S0 o'clock this morning and the work
it did is subject to revision.
Deported Miner Commits Suicide.
DENVER, June 23. â Emil X* John
son, a miner who was deported from
Cripple Creek by the military, ' com
mitted suicide here to-day. He was
despondent because his wife and two
small children were left destitute in
Cripple Creek.
Under this ruling the entire estate
roes to the widow. The only property
in her possession at the time of his
death, however, was the money he
itft her in the bank. If the other
money is to be recovered from Rey
nolds it must be done by another
rult.
"When illness becomes so great that
there is little enjoyment left in life
1 can understand a man balancing up
i re against the other and forestalling
"hat he believes to be the inevitable."
j-aid "Judge Greene in the course of re
marks made by. him at the probate of
the Hartery trill to-day.
By Haiiery'B arts shortly before hi?
death Judge* Greene, however, is of
ihe opinion that he was not sane and
that there was Dot EUflieient cause for
him to commit #uÂ«h an a<t. The de
i eased lived at Hay wards and was
posfcessed of considerable mean?. His
v.ife was ill in San Francisco, and he
Â« oniplained to friends that her family
was petting all of his money.
A few days before he killed himself
he gavo J. F. Reynolds, president of
i he Oakland Meat Company, a deed to
property at Haywards valued at about
$10,000. A couple of hours before his
death he wrote an order to the Oak
land Savins* Bank to give his wife
*HO0 he had on deposit there. He had
a brother with whom he had never
quarreled and a niece of whom he was
very fond. He gave neither of them a
cent. Most of his property was given
to a comparative stranger, and to the
wife. who. it was alleged, was the
< auw of his Insanity, he gave all that
he had left. From these actions Judge
Greene held that Hartery was not of
*ound mind.
A man can be the sanest of men
and still commit suicide, according to
the expressed opinion of Judge W. E.
Oreene to-day; but Michael Hartery,
Tvhose will is being contested, was not
une of these.

For many years Heyneman was a
hackman and stableman in this city.
His health failed some time ago, when
lie was attacked by rheumatism. For
seven months he had been unable to
v/ork. Each day's sufferings added to
his burden. At noon to-day he went to
a nearby drug' store, bought strych
nine and returned home with the poi
son. He went to the basement, took
the powder and was dead at 2:30
o'clock. The Coroner took charge of
the body.
Heyneman was 43 years old, a native
of California. His father was one of
the first residents of . Oakland, having
for years conducted a large garden re
sort on the site of City Hall park.
Frederick M. Heyneman, despondent
from lilness and lack of employment,
swallowed strychnine this afternoon at
his home, 813 Castro street, and then
called his wife and four children to say
good-by to them. Little Claire, his 11
year-old daughter, was the first to re
spond to her father's call. In the base
ment she found him in convulsions.
With a scream of terror the child ran
out. alarming the neighborhood. Dr.
J. T. Kitchings was summoned, but
Heyneman was dead before the physi
cian arrived.

The accident, which resulted in the
permanent Injury of one of the doctor's
valuable horses, was caused by the .rot
tenness of the planking of the bridge,
which in some places is so decayed that
it will scarcely support the weight of a
man.
The srjot where the accident hap
pened is near the east end of the bridge.
Dr. Dunn was driving at a rapid pace
when suddenly one" of the horses
stepped upon one of the rotten planks.
Both of its fore feet went through the
bridge and the horse was thrown, tear
ing the harness and breaking the pole
of the buggy. . .
The sudden stop threw Dr. Dunn
from the seat and he narrowly escaped
being hurled over the dashboard under
the struggling horses. By the time the
creature was extricated from its plight
its fore legs and shoulders were gashed
and torn by the splintered planks, and
the horse was permanently crippled.
The frantic struggles of the animal
smashed a large hole in the flimsy
flooring, which broke away repeatedly.
Dr. Dunn on his return immediately
notified -the Street Department of the
condition of the bridge, which has been
out of repair for a long time.
Dr. J: P. H. Dunn, a well-known
physician of this city, had a. narrow
escape from death on the Eighth-street
bridge this evening while returning
from a call on a patient in Ea^t Oak
land.

The contest over the estate of the
late Gertrude Goewey Havens, wife
of John W. Havens of Berkeley, has
been compromised, and to-morrow the
formal notice of the dismissal of the
contest will be presented to the court.
The Infant son and beir, bora a few
da>-8 prior to the death of Mrs. Havens,
by the terms of the compromise, will
Inherit all of its mother's interest in
the Goewey Estate Company of San
Francisco, valued at about $30,000 and
bringing in a monthly income of be
tween $75 and $100.
John W. Havens, father of the in
fant, was 'appointed its guardian by
Judge \V. K. Gre.ene this morning for
the purpose of effecting the compro
mise. By agreement Charles, Frank
and James Goewey, who were contest
ing the probating of their sister's will,
are to receive about $2600 and some
personal property which formerly be
longed to her mother. The entire in
terest of the deceased in the - Goewey
Estate Company, however, is to go to
the child, who is 15 months old.
By a will made by Mrs. Havens on
her wedding day she left all of her
interest in the Goewey Estate. Com
pany to her three brothers. She and
her husband were to travel in Europe,
and she provided that, in case of ac
cident, the brothers should inherit the
property. The will was never changed
until Mrs. Havens was on her death
bed. A/son had been born to her. and
when she was told that she could not
recover she made a will leaving every
thing she possessed to the child.
The brothers filed their will" as
against the last one. and claimed that
their sister at the time she made thi3
will was not competent to make one,
and that she had been unduly influ
enced. She was so weak at â¢ the time
that she was unable to sign her name
and could only make. her mark. By the
compromise the trial of the contest
will now be avoided.

These matters are a Just cause for complaint
by taxpay- rÂ« of this county and should be rem
edied. '
We find that, notwithstanding the wealth of
this county and the large amount of taxes
collected, the merchants are obliged to watch
the different funds available before extending
credit to the county, and some refuse to sell to
the county under any conditions. It frequently
happens that, owingito the probability of there
being a deficit In the several funds of the coun
ty, and bills not being, paid promptly... mer
chant* in making their bids put some at a
much higher price than . they would accept if
they were eure of getting their money. The
credit of this county should be as good as that
cf the United States Government, and the war
rant* on the 'county trÂ«*.aÂ«ury should not haVe
to be disposed of at. a discount. . .
We investigated the condition of the town
ship Jails at Pleasanton | and Livermore and
found the Jail at Livermore in an unsanitary
condition, which has since been remedied. We
recommend the building of an additional town
ship Jail, steel lined, at Pleaj-anton, this being
necessary 6n account of the overcrowded condi
tion of the Jail at certain times during the
year.
Having finished the duties for which we were
impaneled,- we respectfully request your, hon
orable court for our discharge as members of
this Grand Jury. Very respectfully submitted.

Oakland, Cal., Juno 23, 1904.
lowing report regarding the charges
against Supervisor H. D. Rowe:
We havt Investigated the charge* brought
against Supervisor H D. Rowe in regard to
his having charged excessive mileage, and In
our Judgment Supervisor Rowe d,id noC over
charge mileage, but acted within the law pro
vided to govern Supervisor* in the matter of
mileage.
Inasmuch as it has come to the attention of
the Jury that the Supervisors contemplate
changing the grade of the ground ' around the
Courthouse, wo consider .. any such change
would be an extravagant and useless expendi
ture of public moneys and that no additional
light would be given to the basement as a re
sult of proposed work. We strongly recom
mend that the proposed change be not made.
The grounds around the county buildings in
Oakland wÂ« find are taken care of at an ex
pense of two hundred and forty- five dollars per
month, far which expenditure the work done
la entirely Inadequate, the grounds .around the
Courthouse being In a deplorable condition,
and that thla is by far too great an expendi
ture for services rendered.
The Board of Supervisors' refusal to
pay the claim of C. S. McMullln for
$20,000 for the discovery of assessable
property .which was not on the assess
ment roll is sustained.
This is the Jury's stand on the in
firmary deficit:
In the matter of the deficit In thÂ» County
Infirmary fund, amounting to about $17,009,
Inasmuch as special legislation has in the past
been provided for the payment of a deficit in
the city and county of San Francisco, we rec
ommend that such special legislation be enacted
as will place the credit of the county on a
proper. basis and that future Boards of Super
visors be fo governed by such needful amend
ment to the county government act as will preÂ»
vent a recurrence of this deficit in any tund,
and the finances of the county should be so
managed as to leave a balance In each fund at
the end of the fiscal year! ' Â¦ .
In relation to the extensive repairs being
doqe about the Courthouse at the present time,
we criticize the Supervisors for entering into
an- agreement for mechanical work, such as
paper hanging and painting, at an -expense* to
the county of $tt per day for eight hours' -work,
when the master painters' charge for private
work is but 1 1 50 and $5.
The District Attorney's office was renovated
at the enormous expense of 11030. being for
material furnished and, 135 days' labor at $6
per day. .. v
In the matter of moneys paid to indigent*,
we find that the amount of money paid la
largely In excess of last year, and we find no
reasonable explanation of this, and recommend
a more careful expenditure of the public
money for these cases.
We Indorse the plan of the Board of Super
visors to co-operate with the different charita
ble organizations, and believe this co-operation
will be productive of a saving to the 'county.
In the. matter of extravagances In purchase*
for the county, we find upon investigation that
the highest prices are often paid, and, in order
to curry out the Idea of purchasing from local
merchant)*, the county Is obliged In some cases
to pay a" very large percentage more than
goods could be purchased for in the open mar-
We deplore this insufficiency In the statutes
and the number of loopholes left for the
escapo of guilty parties because of technicali
ties and vague laws.
This applies In particular * to the racetrack
at Emeryville, the very hotbed and source
of crime. The county stink* with this evil,
and all honorable consideration should be given
to the limiting of Its corruption.
Emeryville was incorporated for the purpose
of prohibiting Interference with- the vice to be
carried on within Its . boundaries, millions of
dollars spent, and as a reward we receive
defalcations and ruin to our Institutions, both
public and private.
We recommend that a more definite law be
pasted governing poolselling and the necessity
of confining all horseraclng within the State
to two weeks In the year.
The Jury investigated the matter of
slot machines and caused all money
paying machines and gambling de
vices to be abolished throughout the
county, except such machines as are
run as merchandise machines, which
they were advised are run under the
protection of the law. With regard to
street signs and obstructions the Jury
recommended the regulations govern
ing and regulating billboards, fences
and street obstruction?, more particu
larly in front of buildings in course of
erection, be thoroughly revised and
enforced, especially within the fire
limits of the city, these regulations to
include proper passageway and pro
tection to pedestrians in front of
buildings in course of construction.
The Grand Jury submitted the fol-
The Oakland race track came in for
a severe scoring at the hands of the
jury in the following words:
RACETRACK CENSURED.
There has been considerable criticism re
garding the expenditure of money for the
County Infirmary: inasmuch as this is a
charitable, institution and the expense per
capita as compared with other large cities
very moderate, we recommend that additional
facilities be granted and the institution be
made thoroughly up-to-date.
The jury made thorough Investigation into
the charg-en brought, against the management
of the County Infirmary, more particularly
regarding fraud In drugs, and we beg to
report we could find no evidence to support
the charges brought against Dr. Clark.
After Investigation of the charges of ex
travagance in furnishing the rottage of the
superintendent this body flndi the charges un
founded.
The Grand Jury found that the Coun
ty Jail has been kept in first-class con
dition under the administration of
Sheriff John Bishop, with the single
exception that the Chinese quarter,
which is used for the United States
prisoners, is somewhat overcrowded.
Regarding the charges brought
against the management of the Coun
ty Infirmary" the report was as fol
lows : t
In the matter of the mutilation .of the rec
ords in the Recorder's office we found that
the binding of about seventy-five books had
been mutilated, but the evidence obtainable
by the Jury was insufficient to Incriminate
ar.y Derson or persons.
In regard to the conduct of the coun
ty affairs the jury made an exhaustive
investigation and had the following to
say on the. extravagance in county
management:

"I have Introduced to you four of a

The whole convention laughed. Car-
Senator Foraker's speech seconding
the nomination of Fairbanks evoked
warm applause. The Ohio Senator said
the Republican convention had done
well in its nominations and would end
as it began. His characterization of
Senator Fairbanks as a "fit running
mate for President Roosevelt" was ap
plauded.
Chairman Cannon Introduced Gover

was in high favor with his audience.
He concluded with a second to the
nomination of Senator Fairbanks, say

His words produced another demon

for some time. Cries of "Fairbanks,"

As is -usual in all conventions, the
closing was full of confusion. The del
egates enjoyed themselves, while the
ofllcers struggled with the routine that
was necessary ' to complete the record.
The galleries were empty by the time
the. clerks had shouted the resolutions
and only here and there did a handful
of delegates wait to see the end of the
Republican National Convention of
1904. . , ! i,'>
Graeme Stewart of Illinois was rec
ognized and- moved "that the conven
tion do now adjourn sine die,".
Chairman Cannon put the motion. He
declared It carried and brought down
his gavel; with a resounding whack at
2:S5 o'clock.
"An? there other nominations '!" called
the chairman. "Hearing^ none, it re
mains for me to declare Charles W.
Fairbanks of Indiana the candidate of
the Republican party for the term com
mencing March 4. 1905."
Beveridge, silk-hatted and with a flag
in his hand, led* a- round of cheers.
Great confusion reigned and it was dif
ficult to control the proceedings. The
convention was on its feet and cries for
Fairbanks began. Order could not be
restored until Cannon announced that
Senator Fairbanks was not in the hail.
Senator Dolllver was recognized and
offered a resolution providing that
Chairman Cannon and Temporary

CHICAGO, June 23. â Rev. Thad
deus A. Fniveley, rector of St. Chry
sostom's Church, opened the conven
tion with prayer, as follows:
Almighty God. our Heavenly Father â Infinite.
Eternal. All-wise and Ever Merciful Creator
and Presciver of all mankind â with profound
re\cretice we acknowledge theo as the Source
of lAtf and Strength, the Great* Invisible One
who epeakn to us through this wonderful uni
verse of which man so marvelous is but one
of thy numberless works of wonder and power.
We confess thee as the Giver of life and light
and every good and perfect gift.
Gathered 'Jjere as children of this great artd
wonderful country, where man has drawn near
to thee. we beseech thee to be with us In lov
ing benediction and guide us In our. thoughts
and words and deeds. As citizens of this land
of privilege and freedom to all. we pray for
cur country â the dear land for which bur
fathers fought In the long strife for freedom
for all. By thy gracious help. It is the land
of the free and the home of the brave. We
pray that thou wilt guide us ever by thy
power and wisdom in such ways that our lib
erty may never degenerate Into license, and
that our people may be brave, not simply with
brute courage that is ready to face force and
violence, but with the higher moral power
which makes us strong to battle for the truth
and honor and noble principle.
We beseech thee to give to our whole nation
the strong de&lre and purpose to uphold law
and order and to seek noble character and
true integrity as the mo4 sublime achieve
ments of the race, far greater and more pre
cious than riches or mighty conquests. Grant,
we pray thee, that the benumbing touch of
material posyesslonn and the lust or power may
never blind us to the true greatness and glory
of moral advancement. Help us ever to re
member that the fathers of this land and
government were patriots of never-dying fame.
because they believed that poverty and defeat
with unsullied honor are far better than vast
wealth and world-wide Influence purchased at
the cost of Ebame and dishonor.
Rev. Thaddeus A. Snlvclpy. a Chicago
Rector, Chaplain on Third Day.
God grant that In our party s struggle to
reach that time it may ever have a man to
place before the American people for their
suffrage who has the ability, courage, hon
esty and aggressiveness of Theodore Roosevelt.
OPKNS WITH PRAYER. '
With it will "come that calm and peaceful
assurance that while prosperous, happy and
contented at home, a wise, safe and skillful
diplomacy guards and protects our every inter
eEt throughout the civilized world.
And finally with It will come an' advanced
step toward the fulfillment of the great mis
sion of the Republican party.
And that mission will not be performed until
every section of our constitution and every
amendment thereof shall be respected and made
effective â and until every citizen of every sec
tion, of every race and of every religion shall
proclaim in one grand chorus of that consti
tution. "Thou art my shield and buckler."
With his nomination and election what an
inspiring prospect opens up before the party
and the nation. With it will come new efforts
to promote a greater prosperity and a larger
measure of happiness to all who dwell within
our borders.
AN* INSPIRING PROSPECT.
The business man. the capitalist, to whom
this administration has brought abundant suc
cess, eagerly await his nomination. So surely
as he Is nominated by this convention to-day
so surely will he be elected by the people In
November.
The laboring Interest demands him.
The farmer, as with happy heart he gathers
in his bounteous harvest, stands ready to do
battle for his return. The miner, who In con
tentmfnt digs away In the bowels of the
earth, sees In him his salvation from oppres
sion and encroachment.
First of all, the powerful Christian and
moral sentiment of the nation demands his
nomination, and every Christian and moral
Agency will be exercised for his election.
He is, for these good and sufficient reasons,
the man whom the people of every section and
In every walk of life want for thia high of
fice.
United States and every amendment thereof
should be rigidly enforced, and that its vio
lation by whatever subterfuges or indebtedness
of expression should be condemned and rem
edied.
On the platform made yesterday we have
placed our candidate, who is to head the ticket.
On the ticket with him as his associate for
the Vice Presidency we want to place a man
who represents in his personality. In his belief.
In his public service, in his .high character,
all the splendid record the Republican party
has made; all the great declarations of the
former platform?, and a man who will typify.
as tho leader of our ticket will, the highest
ambition and the noblest purpose?? of the Re
publican party of the United States. (Ap
plause.) I will not delay you with an eulogy
of Senator Fairbanks beyond simply eaylng
that, to all who know him personally, as" thos?
of us do who have been closely associated
with him In the public service, he. has met
all the requirements so eloquently stated by
Senator Depew. He Is of Presidential caliber.
He has all of the qualifications of that high
office for which he has been named, and by
all of these potent considerations. In the name
of the forty-six delegates of Ohio. I second
the nomination of Senator Fairbanks.- â¢
CHICAGO, June 23. â Great applause
followed the speech of Senator For
aker of Ohio, who seconded the nomi
nation of Fairbanks for Vice Presi
dent. He said:
Gentlemen of the Convention: â We have
come here to-day for three things: To make
a platform, to name the next President of the
1'nited States and name alao the next Vice
President of the United States. We have done
two of these things and are about to do the
third. And we have done both of thq things
we have done, well. The platform we adopted
yesterday has already met the favorable judg
ment of , the. American people. It is the
counterpart of the best the Republican party
has ever adopted, and. if you would know
how high Is that tribute, recall the fact now
of which every Republican may justly feel
proud â that of all the many plattorros we have
made In the fifty years of our party life, we
wouid not to-day strike one of them from our
record If we could.

There are times when great fitness is hardly
less than destiny. when the elements
i=n com* topether that they select the agent
they will use. Events sometimes select the
Ftrongest man. as lightning goes down the
hUrhest rod. And ro it H with those events
wmch for many months with unerring .sight
have led you to a single name which I am
<hosen onlv to pronounce: Gentlemen. I nomi
nate for President of the United States the
hlphcst living t^pe cf the youth, the vigor
and the promise of a great country and a
great age. Theodore Roosevelt of New Tork.
A profound student of history, he Is to-day
the great history maker in the world. With
the Instincts of the scholar, he Is yet forced
from the scholar'* pursuits by those superb
qualities which fit Mm to the last degree
lor those great world currents now rushing
past with larger volume and more portentous
aspect than for many years before. The fate
cf nations Is still decided by their wars. You
may talk of orderly tribunals and learned
referees; you may sing in your schools The
gentle praises of the quiet life; you may strike
from your books the last note of every martial
anthem, and yet out in the smoke and thunder
will always be the tramp of horses" and the
Mk-nt. rigid. upturned face. Men may
prophesy and women pray, but peace will
come here to abide forever on this earth only
when the dreams of childhood are the ac-.
cepted charts to guide the destinies of men.
Events are numberless and mighty, and no
man can tell which wire runs around the world.
The nation basking to-daj- in the quiet of
contentment and repose may still be on the
rieadly circuit and to-morrow writhing in the
toils of war. This Is the time when irreat
figures must be kept in front. It the pressure
is great the material to resist it must be
granite and iron. Whether we wish it or
not, America is abroad in this world. Her
Interests are in every street, her name If
en e*WT tongue. Those interests so sacred
and stupendous ehould be trusted only to the
care of those whose power. nklll and c<>uraie
have been tested and approved. And in the
man whom you will chow, the hiehest e<-ntc
of every nation in the world beholds a, man
who typlfi p s Â»s no other livlnsr American <ioea
1h<Â» spirit and the purposes of the twentieth
cjiturj'. H* does not claim to be the Solomon
of his time. There are many things he may
not know, but this Is sure, that above nil
things else he ftainls for progress, courage and
fair play, which are ihe synonyms of trje
American name. ,
He Is no stranger waiting In the shade to
be called suddenly Into public light. The
American people have seen him for many years
and always where the fight was thickest and
the greatest need was felt. He has bÂ«en
alike consplcuoos in the pursuits of peace
and In the arduous stress of war. No man
now living will forget the spring of '98. when
the American mind was so inflamed and
American patriotism so'aroused( when among
all the rarer citizens surging to the front as
6oldlers. the man whom this convention has
already in its heart was among the first to
hear the call and answer to his name. Pre
ferring peace but not afraid of war; faithful
to every private obligation, yet first to volun
teer at the sign of national peril; a leader in
civil life and yet so quick to comprehend the
arts of war that he grew almost In a day to
meet the high exactions cf command. There
is nothing which so tects a man as great and
unexpected as danger. He may pass bis life
amid ordinary scenes and what he is or
does but few will ever know. But v/hen the
crash cornea or the flames break out, a mo
ment'* time will single out the hero in the
crowd. A flash of lightning In the pight .will
reveal what years of daylight have not dis
covered to the eye. And so the flash of the
Spanish war revealed that lofty courage and
devotion which the American heart bo loves
and which ' you have met again to decorate
and recognize. His qualities do not need to be
retold, for no man In that exalted place since
Lincoln " has been better known in every
household in the land. He is not conservative,
if conservatism means waiting till it is too
late. He is not wise. If wisdom is to count a
thing a hundred times when once will do.
There Is no regret so keen In man *>r country
89 that which follows an opportunity unem
braced. Fortune soars with high and rapid
wing, and whoever brinjrs It down must shoot
with accuracy and speed. Only the man with
steady eye and nerve and the courage to pull
the trigger brings the largest opportunities
to the ground. He does not always listen
while all the sages speak, but every day at
nightfall beholds some record which if not
complete has been at least pursued with con
science and intrepid resolution. He is no
slrnder flower cwaylng in the wind, but that
heroic fiber which is best nurtured by the
mcuntains and the snow. He spends little
time In review, for that he knows can be done
hr the schools. A statesman grappling with
tbÂ» living problems of thp hour, ht eropes but
little In the past. He believes In -golnr ahead.
He believes that In shaping the deetlnics of
this great republic, hope Ih r higher Impulse
than regret. He believes that preparation for
future triumphs is a more important duty than
an Inventory of past mistakes.
A GREAT HISTORY MAKER.
XO3IIXEE XO STRANGER.

That the sun, moon and stars move
across the heavens must obviously
have been among the earliest scientific
observations. It required a relatively
high development of the observing
faculties, yet a development which man
must have attained ages before the
historical period, to note that the moon
has a secondary motion which leads it
to ihift its relative position as regards
the stars; that the stars themselves,
on the ether hand, keep a fixed rela
tion as regards one another, with the
notable exception cf two or three of
the most brilliant members of the gal
axy, the latter beins the bodies which
came to be known finally as planets,
or wandering stars. â Henry Smith Wil
liams, LL. D., in Harper's Magazine
for July.
Primitive man must, frcm a very
early period, have observed that the
ran gives, light and heat. It required
but a slight extension of this observa
tion to note that the changing phases
of the seasons are associated with the
seeming approach and recession of the
sun. This observation, hpwever. could
not have been made until man had mi
grated from the tropical regions and
had reached a stage cf mechanical de
velopment enabling him to live in sub
trcpical or temperate zones. Even then
it Is conceivable that a long period
must have elapsed before a direct cas
ual relation was felt to exist between
the shifting of the sna and the shifting
of the seasons; because, as every one
knows, the period of sreatest heat in
summer and greatest cold In winter
usually comes some weeks after the
time of the solstice. Yet the fact that
these extremes of temperatures are as
sociated In some way with the change
in the sun's place in the heavens must
In time have impressed Itself cpoa even

AGAIN the trans-Atlantic steamship 'lines are en
gaged in a bitter rate war aad as a consequence
the scum of Europe is flowing into New York in
ever-increasing volume. Ten dollars will carry the
English pauper from Southampton or Liverpool to the
Ellis Island immigrant bureau in New York harbor.
Active agents are scouring the poorhouses and the pur
lieus of Whitechapel and Shoreditch with ready bland
ishments for the ears of the submerged tenth of the
great English metropolis. On one day three thousand
immigrants of the pauper class were dumped upon the
oficials at the New York immigration office like so
much coarse coal for the screening.
Of three thousand immigrants who come to America,
oa' these cut rates it is safe to say that not three hua
dred are qualified to become good citizens of the land
of their adoption. It is rarely the honest laborer who
takes advantage of the low passage to fulfill the cher
ished ambition of a removal to the land of opportuni
ties; it is too commonly the hopelessly poor, the hope
lessly degraded who sees ia the opportunity offered a
chance for a change that certainjy will not leave him in
a worse state than was his first. Scraping together
barely enough money to cross the palm of the steam
ship agent this immigrant lands in New York saas
scrip and sans ambition. He swells the souring lump
of unwashed humanity in New York's tenements that so
persistently resists leavening.
With the pressure of this immobile mass of paupers
constantly increasing in the centers of population along
the Atlantic coast it is to be expected that there must be
a giving way some place. This yielding comes from
the poorer artisans and operatives, American bom, who
cannot compete with the starvation labor of the foreign
element They consequently move West and the
Eastern States lose a valuable prop in the economic aad
social foundation of their being. Even in the West lands
are being taken up so quickly that for some there â¢ re
main only the opportunities offered by the virgin terri
tory of the western provinces .of Canada*
Even with the constantly increasing stringency of our
immigration restrictions and the rigor with which they
are enforced the swelling tide of pauper immigration
seems to be only skimmed, not checked. While we are
taking into our borders all sorts and conditions of\new
citizens our neighbor in the north is gaining her fresh
blood by a severe conservatism of selection which in
sures good citizens. No man enters a Canadian port
who doe3 not carry a recommendation from a trusted
land agent in the Old World or a sufficiently convincing
title of financial and moral integrity.
Congress has done much to stem the flood of immi
gration. Because by its laws Anarchist Turner was de
ported there came a howl against "the subversion of
constitutional liberties," but until we have restrictions
approximating, at least, those of Canada in the fineness
of their mesh the migration of the unfit from Europe
will continue to flood us with a horde of people whom
it will be' hard for us to assimilate.

The new proposition of the platform will not be novel
to readers of Tee Call, since it responds to demands,
made in our columns frequently during the last three
years. The constitution of the United States requires
that when classes of voters are disfranchised for reasons
over which they have no control, such as race, color or
previous condition of servitude, the representation in
the House and the electoral college of the State which
enacts such disfranchisement shall be decreased in the
proportion that the disfranchised class bears- to the
whole population. When the constitution was adopted
cne of its compromises provided that in the . Congres
sional apportionment five slaves should count as three
in the enumeration of population to determine the ratio
of representation in Congress.
This three-fifths representation of non-voting chattel
slaves grew to be obnoxious to the sense of justice in
the free States. But it was constitutional and it stood
and was the means of giving the South her supremacy
in our national affairs before the Civil War. If the
South can now do two-fifths better for herself by count
ing every negro as one in ths ratio of representation and
at the same time deprive them of the franchise the Fed
eral constitution will be grossly violated. As the North
stood three-fifths slave representation, because it was in
the constitution, the South must now stand the com
plete elision of the negro race from the ratio of repre
sentation because it is in the constitution. She cannot
cat her cake and keep it
The negro disfranchisement has been before the Su
preme Court, which decides that it is a political ques
tion "for Congress, the political branch of the Govern
ment, to decide. The constitution fixe3 the penalty for
denial of the negro franchise. It is a reduction of repre
sentation. The Republican party does not propose to
force negro suffrage upon the South. It does not pro
pose to strike down the constitutions of the Southern
States, which by the "grandfather" clause and other de
vices rob the negro of the ballot. It does not propose to
in any way plant a footprint inside the boundary of
State rights. But it does propose that the constitutional
penalty shall be enforced, and that the South shall not
tske away the negro ballot and at the same time enjoy
an unconstitutional excess of votes in the House and
the electoral college. To this policy no reasonable man
in the South can object. . If the South have sixty mem
bers of the House and sixty electoral votes in violation
of the constitution pride and self-respect should dictate
to her leaders the policy of surrendering them that she
may be purged of" the offense.
It is well here to quote the exact language of the con
stitution, found in the second section of the fourteenth
amendment: "Representatives , shall be apportioned
among the several States according to their respective
numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each
State excluding Indians not taxed. But when, the right
to vote at any election for the choice of electors for
President and Vice-president, Representatives in Con
gress, the executive and judicial officers of a State, or
the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any
of the male inhabitants of such State, being 21 years of
age and citizens of the United States, or in any way
abridged, except for participation in rebellion or other
crime, the basis of representation therein shall be re
duced in the proportion which the number of such male'
citizens shall bear to the whoTe number of male citizens,
21 years of age, m such State."
A close examination and strict construction of that
section, taken in connection with the preceding section
that grants negro suffrage, make it plain that the authors
of tHe fourteenth amendment contemplated the denial of
suffrage to the negro, and were aware that the Federal
Government could not coerce a State in the mattei and
that its power ceased when the penalty of reduced
representation was enforced. The South has incurred
that penalty by negro disfranchisement and should take
its medicine. The free States did by enduring three
fifths slave representation from 1789 to 1864.
The demand that" our nationals must have the pro
tection cf their Government everywhere, against the at
tempt of any foreign Government to deny to them jus
tice, is timely. Even in this hemisphere our pride has
been., too often shamed by ccpunished invasion of the
rights of Americans by the small spitfire Governments of
Latin-America.
THE Chicago platform satisfactorily reviews the
Republican record and pledges the future action of
the party. Protection is upheld as a cardinal doc
trine, and needed revision of tariff schedules is promised
as a matter of course. The pledge that our merchant
marine shall be revived, is repeated and will be "carried
out. It is cot only an economic necessity, but b a
necessary adjunct to the upbuilding of our navy. With
the vast majority of our foreign commerce carried in
foreign bottoms we are at the mercy of events if the
f.ags ur.dcr which it goes and conies should be at war.
Net only would our export trade suffer, but impairment
of our imports would cut off the tariff revenue of the
country to the embarrassment of the treasury.
The declaration that labor and capital must alike sub
mit to the law is satisfactory to every orderly citizen and
good American. Only those who advocate partial ad
ministration of the law or its complete submersion in
the interest of a class and against the great principles
of civil liberty can object to the platform paraphrase of
President Roosevelt's declaration, that "no man 13
above the law and no man is be!ow it."

The park should be mapped; its trees and plants
catalogued and described; its climate, streams, fauna and
all that relates to it put in a volume that will make" one
of the most attractive .advertisements of San Francisco
and the Stare that has ever been issued. All of this will
grow out of the wisely planned publicity excursion
which will be conducted by the State Board of Trade.
When the park becomes known an impetus will be given
to park extension and forest preservation that they can
get in no other way.
people in San Francisco have ever seen this forest park.
If it were located anywhere in Europe thousand* of
touring Amerioans would visit it and tell of its wonder^
at home. But it is near to us, convenient of access and
practically unknown* and mrmited.
The State Board of Trade has put San Francisco and
California under many obligations for great service
well rendered.^J3ut ii has done nothing in which this
city is more interested than this publicity excursion.
We want to let the State first, the United States next
and then all the world know that this city has such a
park within easy reach. Out of this publicity will come
improvement in facilities for getting there, and then the
park will be the resort of thousands who seek rest,
pleasure and health. It will also attract botanists and
dendrologists and scientific foresters who want to study
nature.

That is the finest forest park in the world. No
where else is there such an - expanse . of virgin forest,
composed of trees as interesting and beautiful, reserved
for park and pleasure purposes. It is so convenient of
access from San Francisco as to be actually a part of the

sempervirens, are of such girth and; height as to rival
their giant cousins, the Big Trees. The other varieties
of trees are features in the forest and not merely foils
for the redwoods. The beauty and the majesty of the

In her complaint filed last December,
Mrs. Hislop said that the cause of her
husband's breaking of his marriage
vows was a woman known as "Vio
lette." In her testimony on the stand
yesterday she said that the woman was
Violet Griswold, with whom her hus
band had lived and traveled in th"e
â¢north and whom he later brought to
San Francisco. She said that in a let
ter and in conversation Hislop admit
ted to her that he loved the woman
more than he could any one else.
Mrs. Hislop said in her evidence that
her husband was a commercial traveler
and earned fro'm $400 to $500 a month.
When asked if Brown had ever loaned
her any money she replied that upon
one occasion when her husband neg
lected to send a remittance she asked
Brown for a loan of $100. She received
the amount and said that Hislop still
owes it to Brown.
Rose Lamperle, a professional
nurse, testified that she was employed
by Mrs. Hislop in November and De
cember last and only saw Hislop in
the house once. On that occasion he
came to take the children to the park
and later returned with them.
SHADOWED BY DETECTIVE.
The immediate occasion of inviting
Mr. Craw to Hawaii is the damage that
has bet-n done by the leaf hopper, &u
insÂ«:t that has cost the sugar planters
of Hawaii millions of dollars. Mr. Craw
has done valuable work in California
in the line of protecting trees, vines
and crops from the ravages of Insect
pests, using beneficial parasites gath
ered from various parts of the world.
He has been connected with the State's
quarantining of fruit pests for nearly
fourteen years. The engagement to go
to Hawaii results from the work in
formed by Mr. Craw in California.
Mr. Craw will remain in this city un
til socit time in August. In the mean
time ne will make the best arrange
ments he can to care for the interttt3
of the cftice that he is vacating His
work in the quarantine department of
the Horticultural Commission has been
seconded ably by his assistant, E. K.
Carnps. Mr. Cooper says Carnes will
make an efficient officer.
TO FIGHT LEAF HOPPER.
fer from Hawaii.
The salary given in Hawaii Is more
than double that offered in California,
and In this State the position occupied
by Mr. Craw was not considered to be
ctrtaln. Any" Legislature might abol
ish it by withholding the appropriation
to carry on the fruit pest quarantine
and other work of the Horticultural
Commission. Mr. Craw says that, all
things being 'equal, he would like to re
main in California, but he could not see
that it was for his interest to surren
der so flattering and satisfactory an of-
This information will be displeasing
to the fruit growers of California and
to the canning industry and allied in
terests concerned in the protection of
orchards and fruit crops in this State.
When exclusive information was given
in The Call that Mr. Craw had under
consideration an offer to go to Hawaii
as the head of the service in the islands
as chief entomologist there was a stir,
and many efforts were made to per
suade Mr. Craw to remain in Califor
nia. This he probably would have de
cided to do if the inducements had been
at all like those held out officially by
the Hawaiian Government.
YIELDS TO INDUCEMENTS.
Alexander Craw, State quarantine of
ficer against insect pests, has aceepted
the similar position offered him by the
Government and sugar, planters of Ha
waii at an advance of salary from $200
per month to $5000 a year, with a con
tract for five. years.
â¢A cablegram was received by Mr.
Craw yesterday from Honolulu asking
for a decision- He cabled his accept
ance and notified Horticultural Com
missioner Cooper that he would retire
from his position in* the employ of the
State of California.
In spite of rumors to the contrary
Josua Eppinger is still in town. He
Bays that he will In no way try to
avoid a summons from the court. The
notion that he is trying to secretly
leave town he denounces as being pre
posterous. â¢ . â¢
During the day the defendant again
showed signs of failing health. His
head drooped and he leaned heavily
on the shoulders of his son, until At
torney Ach requested Judge Lawlor to
permit him to leave the courtroom.
As there were no witnesses to be ex
amined the Judge readily complied
with the request and the former grain
king was assisted from the court
room.
Arguments as to" admissibility of
secondary evidence occupied the en
tire day in the proceedings against
Jacob Eppinger, charged with obtain
ing money under false pretenses. The
point at issue has occupied the atten
tion of the court for two days and the
courtroom has practically been trans
ferred into a law library, all the avail
able desks being piled high with vol
umes from which citations are made
by the six attorneys engaged in the
case. The argument on the question
at issue would, it was agreed, be fin
ished by 3 o'clock Wednesday after
noon, but- it was not until nearly 5
o'clock yesterday that Attorney Short
ridge, In a burst of oratory including
a plea for "an unfortunate and broken
down merchant," closed the argument.
All manner of cases which might
have bearinsr on the one at issue were
cited by the attorneys, each choosing
a Supreme Court decision of some par
ticular State to support his contention.
If the prosecution would tell of a case
in Massachusetts the defense would
attempt to offset it- with a similar
case from another end of the conti
nent with a dissimilar decision.

it would do for me, and used it for three months. At the end of that time I
was a different woman, the neighbors remarked it, and my husband fell in

that and built up my entire system, till I was indeed like a new woman. â

committee and sai<j his club was the
only. one that complies with the ordi
nance requiring athletic clubs giving
professional boxing exhibitions to have
a gymnasium and 250 members on the
roll. Lev}' said the Shasta Club has no
gymnasium and no membership and
was not entitled legally to obtain a
permit. Â¦ . .
Consternation was spread broadcast
among the promoters of professional
boxing yesterday by the action of the
Supervisors' Police Committee in
granting the August permit to Morris
Levy of the Hayes Valley Athletic
Club. Levy had previously been grant
ed the July permit for the Hanlon-
Nelson tight.
â¢ Manager Coffroth of the Shasta Club
counted on this date, to which he had
postponed the Jeffries-Munroe contest.
"This has come as a surprise to me,"
he said last night. "It upsets the pre
cedent which has been followed for
years In the granting of permits. The
Shasta Club has paid its license and is
entitled to the consideration shown the
other clubs." '

J. Scott Leary of the Olympic Club
won the 100-yard dash. A -mistake on
the part of the starter probably cost
him the record. Only one watch caught
Leary's time and according to that
timepiece the Olympian went over the
distance in 1:00 1-5. The present Ameri

unofficial and therefore will not stand.

The world's swimming record for 220
yards went n-glimmering last night
when Frank Gailey, the modest swim
mer from Australia, shot over the tape
a lap ahead of his nearest competitor
at the Lurline Baths. Galley went over
the distance in 2 minutes 36 and 2-5
seconds. The next best time was that
of 2:38, also. held by an Australian.
This was the principal event of the
swimming championship contests under
the auspice? gf the Pacific Athletic As
sociation, and it brought out a crowd
of about 1000 person?. The remainder
of the programme was an excellent one,
and many spirited contests resulted.
Besides doing the big stunt of the even

HAWTHOKXK SELECTIONS.
Keen rivalry exists between the two
teams. They met in combat last year
and the fire fighters triumphed by a
t-core of A to 2. The members of the
police force were sadly disappointed
iit the result, for they imagined that
beating the sealer? of houses would be
f-asy. They have been waiting for re
venge during all these months and
hope to regain their lost laurels on
Sunday afternoon.
The fire laddies have an exalted opin
ion of their rrowess as stars of the
creen field. Their victory last year
has only served to make them confi
dent of turning the trick once again,
and if practice and confidence count
they are liable to send the coppers
home with the short end of the score
once again.
The eale of seats for the big game
hes been in progress for several weeks
paFt and upward of fifteen thousand
tickets were readily disposed of. It
Fecms every one in the city is anxious
to see the game, so v/hen time is called
by the old favorite, "Rube" Levy, a
howling mob is sure to greet the as
piring diamond stars.
The teams are the pick of the two
departments and any man who does
not make a good showing during the
frame will be an unhappy mortal for
months to come. The players will be:
Firemenâ Bodkin, right field: Welsh, third
*Â»se: Levy, Â«hortÂ«top; Harrington, left. field-
Kelly, second baÂ«e: Murphy, first base:
Ueachara. center fle!<J; FHzpatrick. pitcher;
I^nfleberr. catcher: Ewir.g and Omeo. extra?.
Poll<rÂ» â Plome. shortstop: Casey, third base:
When the fire laddies line up on the
Ki een diamond of Recreation Park next
Sunday afternoon to struggle fcrr base
ball honors with the city'E finest, every
loyal friend of the two departments
will be in the grandstand or on the
bleachers. It will be a game worth
seeing and, being for the benefit of a
Â¦worthy charity, should prove doubly
attractive.
PORTLAND, Ore.. June 23.âDug
dale told his men to wait until the
sixth inning before making their ef
fort in to-day's game. Huss Hall's
chest was painfully in evidence up to
this point in the game. He allowed
nothing to happen that would put fig
ures on the Portland score board,
while his own team mates secured
two one spots. At Dug's private sig
nal thinprs commenced to change.
Six to the good was Portland's share
at the end of the game. The score:

SEATTLE, Wash., June 23.â The Se
attle men thought they had a ten
Â¦ inning: game stowed away this after
1 noon until Charlie Irwin cracked out a
"two-bagger and spoiled ?Â»Â»- delusion.
San Francisco went after the game
first, but Seattle caught up in the
fourth inning. From that time on un
til the end It was a see-saw contest
with plenty of spice thrown in. Jay
Hughes could not get the ball near the
plate early in the game, and when it
did . come over it was hit out. The

HAWTHORNE ENTRIES.
| CHICAGO, June 23. â Racinff will
be resumed to-morrow at Hawthorns
track and Secretary Kuhl has pre
pared -one of the best cards of th*
season, despite ths short time at hia
disposal.
The programme Is made up of purs<Â»
races from beginning-' to end. but a
glance at *the entries proves conclu
sively that practically no stables were
shipped away from Chicago after th*
trouble at Washington Park, which
for a time threatened to close racing
hereabouts for the season.
Horsemen around town were still
discussing the fate of Washington
Park to-day. Most of them seemed
to think the big South Side Club will
never again attempt to hold & meet
ing until a racing bill has been passed
and betting legalized.
That an effort will be made to put
a. bill through the Legislature next
winter seems to be the. general opin
ion, as Lawrence A. Young, president
of the Washington Park Club, ex
pressed himself to this end in an in
terview to-day.
Rumors of the possibility of th*
Governor or the Sheriff interfering
with racing at Hawthorne are said to
be ungrounded. The sport around
Chicago is expected to flourish for thÂ»
balance of the season, despite the mis
fortunes of Washington Park.

The men composing the street sweep
ing force will be taken over by the
Board of Works and continued in their
employment. The work will be largely
experimental during the month of July,
but commencing with the first of
August the board expects to have it
well in hand.
Only . those of the street sweeping
force who are found competent to do
the work will be retained and those
who are dispensed with will be suc
ceeded by efficient sweepers. Schmitz
says that the work is impossible un
der civil service requirements and" no
steps will be taken In that connection
until the board is sure of its position
in the matter Â«f the city doing its own
street cleaning. .
Schmitz says that the body Is handi
capped with the smallness of the ap
propriation made by the Supervisors.
The board asked for an amount in ex
cess of 1300,000. part of which was for
the conEtnicion of a municipal street
cleaning plant. The Supervisors saw
fit to allow but $215,000 and the board
does not desire to be hampered with
civil service regulations in the work.
Schmitz says that If civil service men
are employed and any of them are
found unable to 'do the work, \ either
on account of age or physical debility,
Jt will necessitate the bringing of
charges Involving much red tape, which
will further hamper the board.
The Board of Public Works yester
day completed arrangements to do the
street sweeping during the next fiscal
year, beginning July 1. President Her
bert Schmitz of the board was dele
gated to arrange with the contractors
who are now doing the work for the
renting of their entire street sweeping
apparatus.

On Wednesday we took cut a mining claim
covering this prop*rty. which we own. One
cf the assays on the property, as Is shown by
certificate. Is $12 17 per ten, made by Thomas
Price & Son: another assay $4 <JS per ton; an
other J4 SO per ton: another $4 67; .one other
$5 70 per ton and one a.-Â«ay made by Welsa
beln Bros. & Co.. $4 95 per ton.
These assays are from various parts-"0f the
quarry, but that la the shaft runs about $10
per ton. I do not see why there should not
be sold in San Francisco as well as In Alaska.
We Intended working it ns a quarry until
such time as the method should be discovered
fcr extracting gold as cheaply as possible.
Since we commenced operating the quarry,
within the last two month! 1 , we have sunk a
shaft on the property to prospect and see if any
other veira of ere were present.
In doing this in a depth of about twenty
feet we discovered a ledge of free milling gold
quartz, which we know iÂ« about six feet
thick and will average about $10 per ton. Any
speclroen from ihi-s shaft yklds free gold in
a born nmon. ,
Some morr.inp im-rt Insinuate that this
is not a bena fide proportion, but we hold
certificates proving that we are sincere In uur
Cling of tie claim.
We have owned the property these last nine
years and at the time Wf bought it we knew
that there was gold bearing rock there. How
ever, we never attempted to begin mining
operation*, far at that time there was not the
advancement made in the cyanide process for
extracting gold and silver that there is to
day.

The Supervisors' License Committee
yesterday resumed its inquiry into the
advisability of passing an amended or
dinance fixed the rate to be charged
for automobiles at $2 60 per hour in
stead of J5, the present rate. Several
automobile owners reiterated their ob
jections to the proposed rate, claiming
that it is too low in view of the high
operating expenses of the machines.
The committee postponed action for
the purpose of investigating: the books
of concerns that rent automobiles. It
is desired to ascertain the com of
operating the machines. In the mean
time the companies will prepare state
ments as to the number of machines
in operation, then original cost and
present value, the earning capacity of
each machine per month, the cost of
repairs and the operating expenses as
a basis upon which to fix a rate.
The committee reported in favor of
fixing the license on riding academies
at $2 per quarter when the business
done amounts to $500 per month and
$4 per quarter when the business ex
ceeds $500 per month. The existing
licenses are $10 and $20 per quarter.

{ zlement of W. J. . H. White, who was
1 cashier of the Board of Public Works.
j The city brought suit against White
and liis r sureties,' Manson and the

' amount said to have been taken by
I White.
Yesterday Manson filed a demurrer
j to the complaint, saying first that it
i did not appear that the money alleged
j to have been misappropriated be
longed to the city and also that the
j complaint was uncertain in that it did
i not show from whom White collected
the money nor for what pr?tended
purpose he collected it.
Then the demurrer asserts that
White was not selected or appointed to
! the position of cashier by Manson or
the Board of Public Works and that
the board had no authority to appoint
him under the charter, but he was ap
pointed "wholly by the Civil Service
Commission."
On that ground Manson contends
that the persons named in the city's

The joint Supervisors" Committee; on
Finance and Artificial Lights yesterday,
reportedin favor of allowing the whole
amount of $320,000 appropriated in- the
next municipal budget to the San Fran
cisco Gas and Electrical Company for
lighting the streets and- public build
ings during the .next fiscal year. \ ' '*
The committee imposed conditions re
quiring the streets to be lighted all
night every night In the year, and that
the company install one hundred extra
arc lights and two hundred additional
gas lamps. Light .Inspector Tupper
submitted a "list showing applications
that have been made for lights in dis
tricts throughout the city, and the
Light Committee will select from'thls
list the locations of the new lights.
A. H. Payson. vice president of the
company, agreed on behalf of the cor-,
poration to light the dome of the City
Hall for twelve nights throughout- the
year, to be designated by the Super
visors. The lighting of public build-
Ings, Including the libraries but exclud
ing the schools, the lighting of which
is paid out of the school fund. Is made
part of the agreement, together, with
the furnishing of motive power for the
City Hall.
The comaany had previously offered
to install fifty new electric arc lights
and one hundred additional Welsbach
gas lamps.
The Light Committee began an in
quiry into the complaint of Lyon &
Hcag against alleged excessive charges
made by the San Francisco Gas and
Electric Company for installing electric
light service in a residence on Duboce
avenue. S. L. Xaphtaly, superintendent
of the company^ said he would Investi
gate the complaint and if the charge i3
too high it will be reduced.
The committee granted the petition
of the French colony that the City Hall
dome be lighted on the night of July
14 in commemoration of the fall of the
Bastile.
I Ttilf is a matter, that should not be ap
i preached is a partisan or personal spirit, but
I upon the bread plane of the interest cf the
general public. It would be a matter cf re
gret in the future If the city should now be
nijreard'.y in Its appropriation for costs and
the result of the litigation should be onfavor
i able.
Long s-ays tlje .reporters' fees for tak
ing the testimony alone will amount to
at least $6000 and that it will be Im
possible to make any showing against
the Spring Valley company unless he
can continue the employment of ex
pert engineers and accountants. He
save the services of Messrs.. Dock
weiler and Fiugeraid in behalf of the
city have been valuable, although
they have met with difficulties because
no one appears to know anything defln
ite ab>_>ut the company's properties.
Even these experts have found it im
possible to get accurate drawings of
many of the company's works. Long's
letter concludes:
I wcuH respectfully urgÂ« upon your honor

tion therefore to show that tf the value in
sisted upon by the company should be accepted

I what they tre now.
City Attorney Long sent a communi
cation to the Board of Supervisors
yesterday in which he asks that the
Mayor's v*to of $15,000 of the appro
priation of $25,000 for paying the city's
costs in the two actions brought by
the' Spring Valley Water Company be
not sustained. Long cays that $10,000
will be entirely inadequate to a proper
presentation of the city's side of the
case and that he cannot believe that
the Mayor was fully Advised on the
subject. If he had been fully cognizant
of the facts and the Importance of the
ease the Mayor would have sanctioned
the expenditure, *ays the attorney.
The injunction granted by Judee Gil
bert is similar to that granted in the
case of the Southern Pacific Company
by the SuDerior Court.
In accordance with the prayer of
the Southern and Central Pacific
Railroad companies, Superior Jud?e
Slosa yesterday morning Issued a tem
porary Injunction agaln3t Tax Collec
tor E. J. Smith, restraining him from
selling certain lands belonging to the
railroads for delinquent taxes. The
Tax Collector Is cited to appear in
court next Tuesday to show cause why
the injunction should not be made
permanent. The railroads alleged that
the amounts charged against the lands
were Hens for assessments against' the
ferry franchises, upon which taxes
have been paid to the State.
The restraining order issued by the
court prohibits Tax Collector' Edward
J. Smith from making the usual en
tries in the tax books as "taxes de
linquent." It is custcmary to place
such entries on the delinquent roll and,
if the taxes are not pa;d within the
time limit, to mark opposite each ea
try "(sold to the State." The order of
the court prohibits that practice being
carried out in this Instance until after
the suit for a permanent injunction
h_s beer heard.
The company alleges that the amount
claimed bv ' the Tax Collector as de
linquent for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1904, Is $30,479 03 and the order
of the court prohibits any collection

The big. windjammers are being
towed about from wharf Â¦Â¦ to wharf,
some discharging the cannery sup
plies they carried from here and Puget
Sound, and others filling their holds
with the. clean, new cases, tightly
packed with freshly canned salmon. The
steamers, Kvichak, Nushagak, Naknek,
President, Kadiak, Thistle and Gertie
Storey are working overtime as tow
boats, and ashore and afloat all hands
are hustling hard to make up for the
time lost through the unwonted linger
inp in those latitudes of Jack Frost.
The ice this year acquired a greater
thickness than jisual and was provok
ingly slow in taking its departure.
Most of the steamers are of small
tonnage and the presence of the ice
has added heavily to the labor of
towing the sailing vessels to where
they discharge or load. On account of
the lateness of the Ice it is feared that
the Alaska red salmon pack for this
season will fall short.
The following vessels had arrived at
Bristol Bay, June 10: *
Bristol Bay at present is .probably
the busiest haibor on the Pacific. Th*
water is crowded with vessels kJL all
rigs and sizes, and the shore is black
with - an army of fishermen, cannery
hands, laborers, tally clerks and bosses
of -high and low degree. The remote
Alaska povt is therefore fairly hum
ming with Yankee activity in full
action.
The ships Alex Gibson. Hecla an'd
Eclipse and the bark Nicholas Thayer
were, on June 10, the only vessels of
the Alaska salmon fleet not safely an
chored at "their destinations. This
quartet was then in sight, outside," and
by this time the tardy four undoubted
ly have Joined, the others at the can
nery anchorages.

General Merchandise.
Mexican dollars, after a long period of stag
nation, have recently shown more life and are
now in good demand for Oriental shipment,
as It is reported that the Japanese want them
for use In Manchuria. This would explain the
heavy shipment of $1,270,000 to Kobe by the
Coptic on Wednesday. Quotations are con
siderably higher.

The Poultry market was very much depressed
for everything except large young Roosters and
Fryers, which formed but a very email per
centage of the supplies. A car of Western
Hens, which had been standing on the track
across the bay, was brought into an already
overstocked market and met with a sluggish
demand.

last year. Instead of 10 to 15 per cent larger,
as was recently expected. Reports of too cold

* The report of Edward A. Beals. t*<-tlon CI
rÂ»ctcr. Veiled States Weather Bureau, for the
Oregon Crop Bulletin for the week ended June
21. is a* follows:
The droughty conditions prevailing through
out the State were partially relieved by scat
terir.g *V;owÂ«>rs during the latter part of the
Â¦â¢Â»â¢Â»: but, as a rulÂ», tbe amount of precipi
tation was not sulficiÂ«rnt to do much good,
and more rain is Ledly needed for all crops.
The extremely dry spell has had a damag
ing effect oa Â£pnr.e (rrain. and In seme sec
tion* it will bÂ« light in yield. Fall wheat
a: i. barley have headed nicely and a goxl
yield of both of these cereals Is promised.
Haying U prosrosinj: rarldly under the
fsvorable weather condl:l?r.*: the crop will be
light, erpeclallj- west of the Cascades. The
t.Ttx cutting of alfalfa ha* nearly all been se
cured in rood condition: the yield was above
th* average and the quality generally rood.
Pa*turap* continue* in fine condition, but Is
beeir.Eirr to tfry up eome. Stock is fat and
the supply of milk In the dairy districts con
tinues abundant.
Gardecs and root crop* are making slow
crowth owing to the dryness of the soil. Early
potatoes are doicr well and will â¢ ion be ready
for marketir-jr. Corn haj not made much ad
vancement owing to a Uck cf warm weather.
TTe strawberry season !* drawing to a
close. Raspberries and Kentish cherries are
ripening cicely and promise fairly good yields.
A pplÂ« are doing we'.l. but pears, prunes and

Boston Stocks and Bonds.
NEW YORK, June 23. â Excessive dullness
and sluggishness were the features of the
slock markÂ«t again to-day. The undertone was '
pretty firm and Isolated advances in specialties
helped th* market sympathetically, but some
of the s;>ecialties which performed that func
tion yesterday were inclined to react to-day,
ar.d eo had .their Influence en confusing the
movement of the market. The narrow fluc
tuations of prices, however, were above last
night's level fcr the most of th? day. It is
evident that convictions on the ultimate out
look are by no means firmly held by specula
tors in rtockf, en the part of those at least
who have sufficient means to express their
conviction? in operations in stocks. Sentiment
is decidedly mixed between those who see cur
rent unfavorable r.t.v* sufficiently discounted
in the present declines in the market and who
expect the development to be toward improve
ment and those who fear a continuance of
shrinkage of trade In Industrials. Instead of
inducing orpcÂ«>ing Â«;>eculative operations, this
conflict of ofinicn seems to paraijxe activity
and accentuate the conservatism and even
timidity which' prevail.- This spirit seems to
be a Talr reflection uf that existing in the buel
ness world at large, and Its alteration there
is awaited to stir the securities market,
whether for an advance or a dicline. Amalga
mated Copper's unr**ponsiveness to news of 1
a tavoratle judicial decision in Montana was !
also regarded as highly significant of the
quiescence of a party of capitalists whose mar
ket movements are <-losÂ«"iy watched for leader
ship by the rank and fit* of speculators. In
creases in May net earnings, by reason of re
duced operating expenses for Wabash and New !
Jeremy Central, revealed a tendmcy from which
rr.uch Is hoped toward reassurance of capital.
The failure of a savings bank in Massachusetts
on account of "poor investments" was of effect
on sentimer.t. rather frcm Its example of a con
stant succession of such event* than from its
individual Importance, which was insignificant.
Bonds were firm. Total sales. $2,720,000.
United States bonds were unchanged en call.

Receipts of Hay were suddenly large again,
being !>10 tons, and Included a liberal quantity
of new, it appearing, as one large handler ex
preeeed it, as if the season for new Hay had
suddenly opened In full force. A cargo of new
Clover sold at $8. Strictly No. 1 Wheat, fresh
and bright, from Contra Costa, sold at $llf?
11 50, and choice new Barley and Oat at
$10 50. For new marsh Tame Oat $7 was
bid and refused.' and $7 was bid and refused
for new Volunteer Wild Oat. Quotations for
old showed little change. Â¦
The circular of SomÂ«rs & Co. says:
"A slight increase in shipment of Hay can
be noted during the past week, for the record
shows a total of 2S0O tons, as compared with
2bC0 for the week preceding. Old Hay con
tinues to arrive in undlmlnlshed quantities
and the increase ha3 been occasioned by ship
ments of new Hay, averaging three or four
cars rtally The situation remains practically
unchanged, for in spite of the comparatively
late date we do hot seem to have yet entered
Into the new season. From all indications it
will probably be July 1 before the new crop
will be readily accented here.
. "It will be remembered that on the first day
of JUne Sait year we were entirely out of old
Hay. ThiÂ« . year we carried over at least
one . month's supply, which fact will prove
quite an item in considering the supply and
value of the- new crop. At present everything
Indicates considerably lower prices than was
the range for last year.
"Of the new crop we are receiving an oc
casional car of good Wheat Hay on which we
quote $11*811 50 per ton; a straggling car of
Tame Oat. quotable at from $10 to $10 50; the
balance being various grades of Volunteer,
lowland Oat Hay. Oat and Clover and Alfalfa
and Grass. These various grades iell from
*.Â« 50 to $S htre. according to quality.
"An occasional car of choice old WheaJ Hay
sells for a very good figure, the remaining
grades showing some little weakness from the
quotations of a week ago."

CHICAGO, June 23.â When trading be
gan . In the wheat market to-day ; there
were several factors of a bullish char
acter in evidence, the most prominent be
; ing higher, cables and reports of unfavorable
Â¦ weather in Argentina. There waa a fair gen-.
! eral demand at the start and the market
; opened i quite firm. Initial quotations on July
I being unchanged to a shade higher at M T 4c to
, 84:i$J$5c. September was unchanged at 7Â»!4e.
I During the early part of the session offerings
i were light. A big storm In Hungary inflicting
, severe damage to crops ' caused an advance.
j Later messages from the Southwest referred
I to the Increasing amount of new wheat being
I delivered, at country stations and, to the ex-
I cellence of its quality and the heaviness of
I the yield as claimed by the farmers. Reports
I from the Northwest- also were favorable. The
demand was not equal to the supply and In
consequence a weak undertone developed, July
felling off Â¦ to 64%c. September declined to
70*i c. Â¦ The close on both September and July
was at the low point. - â¢
In corn firm cables and small primary re-'
celpts were bull factors. The market cloned
I with July He lower at 48%c. September
opened at 4$%g48?ic and closed at 484@48%c.
The oat market displayed a weak undertone
j July closed \i@%c lower at 3Sft@3S!ic. Sep
tember closed at 32c.
Provisions were firm on moderate support
from packers. The principal demand was for
ribs. The strength of the hog market helped
provisions. September pork closed 10c higher;
lard up 2405c and ribs were 5Â©~4c higher.

In tha afternoon at concessions. Apricots in
bulk were abundant and canoers reduced their
bids to $25'j30 per ton as to quality, but were
unable to procure any great amount, as dealers
were rather firm In their Â¦views, and besides
the regular trade purchased freely at 2Â©i'-jc

run and the quotations will soon be with
drawn. ' Other kinds of Berries were dull owing

cause of the business feature connected
with a suicide find a sharp reprimand in

"A Cleaner Chinatown" Is the title of
a very readable article, which gives th<Â»
Governor and the State Health Board
credit for the good work they are dolag.
"The Fourth, the Fool and the Fire

Mr. McGowan pleaded for the re
lease of Lillie Edwards, arrested on
Howard street and charged with.va
grancy by Patrolman Skellyr*because
she did not know 'her husband's
whereabouts and might . have_^'- been
driven to suicide by ennui if he (Mr.
McGowan) had not philanthropicaly
rescued the lady from the Slough of
Despond. The Ingeniousness of the
plea staggered the court for a mo
ment, but for a moment only.
"If you did not seem to be more
idiotic than malicious, Mr. McGowan,"
said his Honor Mogan, "I would cer
tainly order your arrest on a charge
which it is hardly necessary to men
tion. This woman is guilty of va
grancy, and I'll sentence her : to-mor
row. As for you â well, you would bet
ter direct your philanthropy in a
worthier channel."

John McCarthy was no sooner re
leased after serving a sixty days'
"trick" for vagrancy than he returned
to his fomer haunt, the Coast Line
depot, and stuck to it until he nar
rowly escaped death from a freight
train and was arrested â¢ on the old
charge. On his previous appearance
before Judge Mogan the defendant
said he was drawn to the depot by
some irresistible attraction, as it was
there he last saw the rich and beauti
ful maiden to whom he was affianced
and from whom he had not heard for
three years. He started to repeat the
pathetic tale yesterday, when he was
abruptly told to go to jail for three
months.
The defendant gave his occupation
as grlass-blowing, and Clerk Gray ven
tured the uncalled for opinion that
his glass-blowing .probably consisted
of puffing the foam from beer glasses.
James Kelly was accompanied by i
friend â present whereabouts unknowi
to the police â when he entered ,j
building in course of construction ot
Folsom street, where, in facetiou:
spirit, the friend picked up a car
penter's saw and playfully thrust i
underneath James' coat. So thor
oughly did James enter Into the spirii
of the joke that he did not attempt tc
remove the implement until he wa;
collared by its owner, Mr. Eberhard
who was at work on the second-flooi
rafters and witnessed the entire side
splitting incident, but failed to grasp
the fun of it. He turned James intc
custody and strangely enough Judge
Mogan shared the serious view of the
case, for he declared James guilty ol
petty larceny and said he would sen
tence him to-day.
Joe Daly, In a faded suit of blue
stole a razor from a Fillmore-stree
barber shop and will be sentenced to
day for petty larceny. His military
apparel, he said, had been retained a;
a souvenir of his service for Uncl(
Sam. which expired several months
ago, and so well did he love the deai
old flag that he would be grateful ii
the court would let him go so that h<
could re-enlist immediately. But his
patriotic plea went for naught. â¢ .
E. A- Peterson, steersman of the scow
schooner Cheerful Clara, thought that
knockout drops had been given him
in his second drink of Pacific-street
whisky, because after imbibing it his
senses fled and remained out of com
mission until about an hour prior to
his arraignment before Judge Mogan.
Dismissing the charge of drunkenness,
his Honor scouted the knockout drops
theory and remarked that two drinks
of the whisky retailed on the Barbary
Coast are sufficient, without the aid
of o^her opiates, to knock out any man
of ordinary mental constitution.
Harry Pollock, the fistic impresario,
celebrated the eve of his departure
eastward by imbibing freely of ten
derloin stimulants and disturbing the
peace to such an extent that Patrol
man Roble arrested him at Ellis and
Mason streets early yesterday morn
ing. He deposited $5 bail, which was
declared forfeited by Judge Mogan
after it was announced that the de
fendant had taken an early train.
E. C. Lonergan, arrested with Pol
lock and similarly charged, was dock
eted to appear before Judge Fritz, but
he, too, allowed his bail to go to the
city's enrichment while he sped east

John Wetzel, driver of a milk wagon,
was on his matutinal round when he
found that one of his customers, Mrs.
Aiken of 3029 Sixteenth street, had ne
glected to leave a pitcher upon her
front doorstep, as had been her wont
before retiring for tÂ»e night, and in
order to prevent her having a milk
less breakfast he took a tin pall from
the porch of Mrs. Dwyer's domicile.
No. S033 Sixteenth street, filled it with
lacteal fluid and left it upon the Aiken
doorstep. On complaint of Mrs. Dwyer
he was arrested for petty larceny, but
the lady subsequently relented to the
extent of declining to prosecute.
It was Bailiff Mahoney who got off
the bon mot anent the originality of
arresting a person for "rushing the
can." . r
Mrs. Nellie Rose and Mrs. Clara
Hadler are joint occupants of No. 40
Stanford street, the latter lady living
on the lower floor. There was estrange
ment between them for some time prior
to the breaking of one of Mrs.-Had
ler's windows by Mrs. Rose and the
consequent inflicting of a nervous
shock upon Mrs. Rose's parrot, from
which that highly educated bird soon
afterward expired. The case is before
Judge Fritz, and several witnesses
haVe already testified that Mrs. Rose
broke the window and that the. parrot
died. Testimony for the defense will
be heard to-day.
When gently reminded by the bench
that she was not the whole court Mrs.
Klock tossed her head like a horse in
fly-time and sniffed defiance. But she
tamely submitted to subsequent objec
tions by the defense.
to her. "That bo?" she smilingly In
quired.
During the examination of Mrs.
Klock the attorney for the defense was
prolific of objections, which so worried
the witness that she finally declared
she would testify in her own way. .
"I object," he shouted. â¢ -.;; <
"Object till you're ->tlred," she re
torted. "I'll tell my story."
Miss Blanche Blackwell, petite,
pretty and 17, was residing at the Lin
wood Hotel when she first met Mrs.
Minnie Klock of 812B Larkin street,
and so struck was that matron by the
girl's vivacity that she invited her to
tea. The invitation was accepted and
Miss Blackwell's bright prattle kept
the table in a roar. Soon after her
departure, however. Mrs. Klock
missed her purse, containing $28. and
after vainly searching the house for
it she reluctantly arrived at the con
clusion that her recent guest had tak
en it. She unfolded her suspicion to
a policeman, who found the young
woman and arrested her.
In the court of Judge Conlan Miss
Blackwell jauntily confessed, that she
stole the purse aud "had a good time
spending the money." Then Mrs. Clara
Cliver. who lives on Minna street,
complained that she, too, had been
robbed of a purse by Miss Blackwell
under circumstances almost similar to
those recounted by Mrs. Klock, and
that her monetary loss was $14. The
girl laughingly denied Mrs. Cliver's
accusation and said that $14 was more
money than that lady's purse had ever
contained at one time.
"What is your regular business?"
the Judge asked.
"I'm a professional acrobat," was
the answer, "and I'm out of a job.",
After looking long and searchingly
at the defendant, \vho?e insouciance
never nickered under the ordeal, his
Honor remanded her till to-day. "Just
at present you beat me," he remarked
Two minutes later Mrs. Mendoza, on
the first floor, was in receipt of all
that had been said about her on the
roof. How the descent of Mrs. Brown
was accomplished so quickly is known
only to that lady herself. That she
slid down a water pipe is strongly
suspected by Mrs. Lisle.
Nor did Mrs. Mendoza waste any
time in ascending to Mrs. Lisle and
saying things. Some of those things,
Mrs. Lisle averred, were unfit for a
lady to repeat within the hearing of
the opposite sex. The tirade, she add
ed, that began on the roof was con
tinued without intermission until she
reached the street, where it was
stopped by the arrest of Mrs. Men
doza for disturbing the peace.
"It seems to me." said Judge Mo
gan. "that Mrs. Lisle and Mrs. Brown
are Just as much to blame for gossip-
Ing about Mrs. Mendoza as Mrs. Men
doza is to be censured for resenting
what she pronounces a slander of her
deceased parent's character and a ljbel
upon her own filial feelings. If it
would be just to punish Mrs. Mendoza
for disturbing the peace, it would also
be just to punish Mrs. Lisle for back
biting a dead person and Mrs. Brown
for disclosing what phe was told in
secrecy. As there is no complaint
against either Mrs. Lisle or Mrs.
Brown I dismiss the charge against
Mrs. Mendoza."
At the bottom of the trouble lay
Sirs. Lena Brown's feminine inability
to abstain from disclosing what Mrs.
Jeroma Lisle had imparted in con
fidence and requested her not to telL
The two ladies were gossiping as they
hung out "washing" upon the roof of
t^eir common dwelling, a tenement
house at 114 Pacific street, and Mrs.
Brown casually remarked that Mrs.
Maria Mendoza, also residing there,
had announced her intention to don
mourning garb in respect to the mem
ory of her father, of whose demise
she had just been notified
â¢â¢How silly!" was Mrs. Lisle's com
ment.
"Why so?" inquired Mrs. Brorrn.
"It goes no farther?"
"Xo, indeed."
"Well, because," Mrs. Lisle ex
plained, "her father was little better
than a pauper, and I'm sure his death
is a blessed relief to all his relatives.
But, of course, this ' ia . between our
eelves."
"Certainly," said Mrs. Brown.
