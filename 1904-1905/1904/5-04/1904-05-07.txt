Japanese troops swarming across the

the railroad and telegraphic communi

and left to its own resources are condi

"dispute, supposed to have been ad
justed, has broken out again and a
crisis" is threatened. Ordinarily a con
troversy between three nations â Bra
y:il, Peru and Bolivia â for the owner
ship of a large triangular tract of rub
ber lands, situated where the three
countries adjoin, Bolivia was elimin
ated* by an agreement satisfactory to
her and it was supposed that Peru's
ctaim also had been met It appears,
however, that Peruvian troops remain
â¢in the territory claimed by Brazil and
â¢to. day Minister Thompson cabled the
t-'tate Department from Rio as fol
â¢lows:
**'If Peru refuses to withdraw troops
from the disputed territory inhabited
by Brazilians, pending negotiations
which Â«re to be followed, if necessary,
'by arbitration. Brazil will immediate
ly resort to force to expel the Peru
vians and will proceed to reprisals."
In official circles apprehension is felt
ts to the outcome of the sharp clash
between Brazil and Peru growing out
of the dispute over the territories lying
in the valleys of the Alto Jura and Alto
I'urus.
The Brazilian legation has made the
following statement:
. "The assertion of right made by'Bra
zil over the territories claimed by Peru
hs not a fact of to-day. This right is
a long-standing one and was. besides,
â¢ recognized by Peru herself in the treaty
of 1831, which settled the boundary

ST. PETERSBURG, . May 6.(10:05 p. m.) â A dispatch received to-night says that Port Arthur is cut off from all communication by land, the Japanese
having debarked in its rear, occupied the railroad and cut the telegraph. -Vice Admiral Skrydloff, who is -en route to Port Arthur to take command of the naval
forces in the Far East, will be unable to reach his destination. Viceroy Alexieff has arrived, safely at Mukden.
The Ministry, of War has . received the following telegram from Major 'General Pflufc, chief of the military staff :
"According to the information I have received seven of the enemy's transportsâ and. afterward about forty â appeared opposite. Pitzewo on the evening
of May 4. On the morning of May. 5 the Japanese began to land at Pitzewo and on .the coast, near Cape Terminal" (about fifteen miles southwest of Pitzewo)
under cover of artillery fire. At this moment about sixty transports were, observed bearing down -upon the whole front, and our posts retired from the shore. All
papers in the postoffice at Pitzewo were removed, and the Russian inhabitants abandoned the town. \ - ' -
"According to Chinese reports, by evening of May 5 about 10,000 of the enemy's troops had -landed and taken, up quarters in the Chinese villages near
the points of debarkation. The enemy sent two columns of about one regiment each, one in' a_i westerly direction. and the: other to the southward.
"A passenger train from Port* Arthur was fired on a mile .and a quarter oiitsjde Polandien (about forty miles north of Port Arthur) by a hun

During the recent Boxer troubles in
China, the Dowager Empress came to
the conclusion that her army was not
up to the standard of other civilized
nations, and of all the countries in the
world she decided that the United
States had the most efficient troops. A
general reform of the Chinese army
was decided upon, and agents were sent
to America to enlist enough soldiers to
officer the entire Chinese army.
Headquarters of the Chinese imperial
reform army were established in Yank
ton, S. D., several months ago, and
Edmund F. English, an army captain,
is said to have been given a commis
sion as brigadier general in the Chinese
army and placed in charge of the re
cruiting office.
A secret agency for securing enlist
ments, it is understood, was long ago
established in Louisville, and up to
the present time the following men
have been slated for good offices in the
imperial army of China: Captain Clar
ence E. Grinstead, a captain of the
legion, will be a colonel; Captain
George D. Lee will be made a major;
Captain J. R. Clements of C company,
artillery, will be made a captain; Cap
tain "Wallace Morris of Company F will
be a captain; Clarence B. Jeffries, sec
ond lieutenant of artillery; Charles C.
McMahon, first lieutenant of 'the quar
termaster's department; Wolsey M.
Caye. second lieutenant of infantry; R.
W. Richardson, second lieutenant of in
fantry; James H. Con way, captain of
infantry; Edmund T. Meriwether. sec
ond lieutenant of light infantry; H. M.
Lawson, captain of artillery; Thomas
W. Beard and David Â»M. Baird will both
be made second lieutenants.
In Chicago, Cleveland, Cincinnati. In
dianapolis, and, in fact, all the cities
of any size in the central West, agents
are working assiduously.
a few days, it is understood, several
of them will arrive in Louisville with
the commissions of fourteen or fifteen
well-known citizens'" who have signed
for service. -. '"' Â¦.

ever held in Connecticut the Demo

fourteen delegates to the St. Louis

vote as a unit for Alton B. Parker of
New York as the Presidential nom
inee. A climax came at the end of two
hours of angry debate between Hearst
and Parker delegates in which there
escaped by a hair's breadth being a
personal encounter in full view of the
convention between former Governor
Thomas M. Waller of New London and
Dr. F. J. Brothers of New Haven. The
question being detiated was the substi
tution of the minority report of the
committee on resolutions for the ma
jority report. The former report fa
vored an unpledged delegation, the lat
ter a pledge for Parker and the unit
rule. Personalities were bandied back
and forth, the attack on Governor Wal
ler accompanying charges that he had
deserted the party in 1S96. Much of
the actual debate between the chief
participants in the incident was un
heard in the uproar, but their actions
could be seen. They were forced al
most Into personal combat "by the del
egates crowding round! The incident
was quickly smoothed over. The mi
nority report was refused substitution,
366 to 186, showing that the Hearst del
egates were outnumbered.
For first delegate at large Homer S.

by a vote of 331 to 127. /

% PARIS, May 6.â An authoritative
statement was given to the Associated
Press frpm the highest Government
source concerning the details and cir
cumstances of the new. .Russian loan,
as follows:
"The situation Â¦ has been much
changed since your interview with M.
Mleczislas de Routkowsky, the Russian
financial agent in London, April 23.
The conditions to-day on which the
loan is based are as follows: .
'"The cost of .the war for the first
five months up to June 1, including
$22,500,000 for railroad equipment, is
$125,000,000. After June 1 the monthly
cost of the war will be $3,500,000 for
the navy and $15,000,000 for the army at
the front, making the total war ex
penses about $245,000,000 for the year
closing January 1 next. The first part
of the war was more expensive thaji
the latter, owing to the cost of mobil
ization and the general expenses in
cident to setting the machinery of war
in motion."
and $9,500,000 on previous budgets,
making the total, economies $67,000,000.
"When the war began the Russian
Government had between $150,000,000
and $200,000,000 to its credit in the'Bank
of Russia and with foreign bankers.
According to the monetary law.'of 1897,
which made gold, the standard for Rus
sia, there was a stock Of gold amount
ing to ; $475,000,000 and a note issue of
$350,000^000. Therefore Russia could
still have placed in circulation* $200,000,
000 to ..$250,000,000 in notes without im
pairing in the slightest the gold law of
1S97. However, by so doing the.mone
tary situation after, the war might
have been' less satisfactory than at
present. .
"Accordingly for the purpose of pro
tecting the internal monetary, situa
tion, trie Russian Government has lent
a favorable ear: to the proposals made
by French bankers and has opened
negatlatipna at St. Petersburg "with
Joseph Hoettinger of the house of
Hoettinger & Co., and with M. Noetz

. TOKIO, May 6.â The report of Ad

details of th? landing of Japanese
troops ou the Liaotung Peninsula, sup
pressing the location of the landing

"Our Seventh Division, with torpedo

The report of Admiral Kataka, com
mander of the third squadron, gives
additional details of the landing. The
admiral reports that his squadron con
voyed the first batch of the second
army to the Liaotung base and adds
that the Kara Maru grounded near* the
base at 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon.
She was assisted by the protected
cruiser Akitsushima, was floated, and
reached her destination safely at 5
o'clock the same evening.
Beyond the announcement that a
certain force of the Japanese army ef
fected a landing- at an unnamed place
on the Liaotung Peninsula yesterday
ami the report of Admiral Hosoya, the
Government absolutely refuses to dis
cuss the nature of their operations or
its plans. General Fukushima of the
General Staff made the announcement
of this movement to the foreign cor
respondents here. He said:
"On the 5th of May some strength of
the "'panese army began to land on
the Liaotung Peninsula."
"Where and in what force?" asked
the correspondents. V- * >!>'
General Fukushima smiled in answer,
but .'-Â¦aid nothing.
"From the east, west, north or
south?" asked the correspondents.
"Out of the skies from heaven,"
answered the general, and the interview

gotiate the issue, of treasury bonds,
running five years; at 5 per cent. These
are", going to be offered - to customers
of the big French financial houses at
near, par. By so doing the Russian
Government reserves the right after
five years to make use of its internal
credit to convert or consolidate these
five-year bonds into a funded debt
bearing a lower rate of interest. The
amount likely to be taken up at once
in Paris' will be $100,000,000 and the is

public subscription at a fixed day will
be 'dispensed with, the issue being sold

The" foregoing: differs from other re
ports concerning the amount of the
loan, but owing to the authoritative
source it can be accepted as- final. It
is understood Â¦ that the terms will be

kin had his way before the war, it Is
said he would have abandoned Port
Arthur, withdrawn farther to the
north and waited - until his army had
become overwhelming in its strength,
when he would have moved forward,
but this was made impossible as a
consequence of the injuries sustained
by. the Port Arthur fleet and the im
possibility of the departure of the fleet
from Vladivostok with a superior Jap
anese force outside that port. There
fore the commander in chief is waiting
at Laioyang until the enemy's plan
shall have developed sufficiently to
show just what line it is proposed to
follow.
Caution forbade an attempt in force
to prevent General Kuroki's passage
of the Yalu, as the troops landed at
Pitzewo might have been diverted to
take the Russians on the flank or In
the rear.
Now that the uncertainty Is partly
dispelled General Kuropatkin, from the
inner lines, is free to act.' That he
purposes to move energetically is
shown by the fact that he has sent re
inforcements to Fengwangcheng.
The Indications are that he Intends
immediately to assume the aggressive
and to strike General Kuroki's army
before the latter can be reinforced
through Korea. Should the Japanese
landed at Pitzewo begin a northward
movement enough Russian troops, it is
said, are in the vicinity of Newchwang
to hold the Japanese in check until
conclusions have been tried with Kuro
ki. It is not anticipated, however, that
the Japanese will march northward,
but it is believed they will devcte their
energies to effect the fall of Port Ar
thur. The receipt of news at any time
of a decisive battle near Fengwang
cheng will not come as a surprise here,
and already rumors are circulating in
the city which, however, lack verifica
tion and are believed to be untrue, that
a. battle has been fought, that the Jap
anese have been defeated with heavy
loss and that General Kuropatkin was
wounded. Another rumor is in circu
latitm that Port Arthur hag been cap
tured, but this also is scouted in re
sponsible quarters.
PRAISE JAPANESE STRATEGY.
British Applaud the Achievements of
the Little Browa Men.
LONDON, May 7.â The British press
is loud In its expressions of admiration
for the brilliant Japanese strategy in
dealing in rapid succession three great
blowsâ the battle of the Yalu. the seal
ing of Port Arthur and the landing at
Pitzewoâ and the development of the
opening moves is awaited with the
greatest Interest. It Is Delieved to be
not unlikely that the primary object
will be an asault on Port Arthur and
an endeavor to capture the Russian
fleet there. This idea is favored by
Henry Spencer Wilkinson in the Post,
a Journal generally well Informed on
Japanese affairs. Other Journals be
lieve that the Japanese have been
contented to place a small force as a
mask at Port Arthur and .will send
their main forces from Pltzewcr to co
operate with General Kuroki's army,
in which case, if the Russian asser
tion that large reinforcements have
been sent to Fengwangcheng is true,
a great land battle is imminent there
or at Liaoyang. It is believed that it
is Japan's second army that landed at
PitzeVo and the destination of the
third army is still to be revealed.
No further news has reached London
beyond, belated dispatches from cor
respondents with the Japanese army
on the Yalu detailing events preceding
the recent battle.
The Chronicle's Tokio correspondent
asserts that simultaneously with the
attack on Port Arthur the Japanese
laid cables between one of the islands
and the mainland as a protection to
their landing place.
The Telegraph's correspondent at
Tokio says the nine sunken fire ships
at Port Arthur were laden with a mass
of stone and cement.
The correspondent of the Standard at
Tientsin cables that Viceroy Alexieff
has called on the Tartar General and
all of the officials at Fengtien to quit

COMRADES THE VICTIMS.
Russians Mistake Their Own Men for
Enemies and Fire.
WASHINGTON, May 6. â The Jap
anese legation has received the fol
lowing cablegram from Tokio, under
date of to-day:
"General Kuroki, commandant of
the First Army Corps, reports that on
May 3 our mounted scouts, after a
severe hand-to-hand fight, drove back
the Russians toward Fenghuangcheng.
Chinese say that on May 1 about 2000
infantry, posted on a hill east of Feng
huangcheng, fired upon 300 comrades
retreating from the Yalu, mistaking
them for the enemy. They wounded
100 and killed seventy. The rest of
the body fled in disorder, abandoning
commissary carts.
"A Russian officer- captured there
states that the only bodies which re
treated in order on May. 1 were five or
six infantry battalions and two artil
lery companies. Two hundred more
Russians killed and wounded were
found on the field and others are be
ing discovered."

PARIS. May 7.â A St. Petersburg
correspondent of the Echo de Paris
sends the following under date of
May 6: { ,.\
"The general staff believes that the
Japanese landed at Pitzewo a number
not less than 40,000, and says that the
bulk . of General Kuroki's army was
this morning about nine miles from
Fengwangcheng. Â¦ The army was ad
vancing in three columns, the third
column following Ihe coast, probably in
order to communicate with the troops
landed 1 at Pitzewo. All the reserves,
provisions and ammunition were land
ed on Elliott Island.
"A 'staff officer said that Lieutenant
General ZassalUch would be kept in the
background during the remainder of
the war, and it is believed that Gen
eral Kuropatkin will personally direct
operations.
"I am positively able to deny the
statement that Port Arthur is bottled
up. The passage is still free.
"The telegraph office has received in
structions not to accept messages for
Port Arthur.
| "Vice Admiral Skrydloff and Vice Ad
miral Bezobrazoff have been ordered to
proceed to Mukden, whence they will
probably go to Vladivostok."
The correspondent repeats the report
that the Japanese have occupied Port
Adams, and says they are advancing
on Po"rt Arthur, the garrison of which
is expected to matfe a sortie.

Opinion on the subject of the number
of bishops that probably will be elected
at this conference can scarcely be
gauged so early in the session. There
are advocates of more missionary bish
ops, v/hich would mean a less number
of superintendent bishops â¢ and vice
versa. Then, too, there is the question
of a negro bishop to be taken into con
sideration. There are at present three
vacancies in the list of active bishops,
two by death and one, that of Bishop
Merrill, by reason of retirement. The
committee on episcopacy, before which
the very important subject of additional
bishops will be referred, probably will
cot take it up for several days, at least
After debate as to what' should be
done with this resolution had dragged
along for more than an hour, some ono
suddenly discovered that there was a
specific rule of the General Conference
which provided for its reference to ihe
committee on boundaries, and it was
so ordered.
"Resolved, That a committee of fif
teen be appointed, to consist of one
minister and one layman from each
General Conference district and one at
large, whose duties shall be to report
back to this General Conference not
later than May 16 a regrouping of the
annual conferences in- the General Con
ference districts, so as to secure, as
nearly as may be, equal representation,
having due regard, however, to prox
imity of territory and similarity of in
terest."
BISHOPS TO BE ELECTED.
The only other important subject
considered by the General Conference
to-day was the resolution: offered yes
terday by Dr. J. F. Goucher, as fol
lows:
The aged Bishop was given a warm
reception when he came forward to
read his address, and upon its con
clusion the audience arose, gave the
Chautauqua salute and sang "Blessed
Be the Tie That Binds."
Bishop Merrill referred feelingly to
his relations with the ministers of the
church during his general superintend
ency, and declared that he relinquished
his place as an active worker "free
from bias or prejudice against a living
soul."
"I began my official service to the
church on April 5. 1S15, at Greenville,
Ohio," said Bishop Merrill. "I am now
in the seventy-ninth year of my age
and the fifty-ninth in the service of
the church. If the General Conference
should meet a year hence I would
have been able to round out sixty
years of active service. But as the
conference does not meet and as I do
not care to face the responsibilities of
an active Bishop for the next quad
rennium, I deem it wise to ask the
General Conference to place me in su
perannuated relation to the church
and elect a younger and more active
man to take my place."
This, in brief, epitomizes the work
done by the conference and committees
to-day.
The request of Bishop Merrill to be
placed on the superannuated list was
not unexpected by the delegates. In
presenting his request for retirement
Bishop Merrill read an interesting pa
per to the delegates reciting his ex
periences as minister during the com
paratively early history of the church
in this country and later as a member
of the Board of Bishops.

LOS ANGELES. May 6.â Very little
progress was made by the Methodist
General Conference to-day, but the
business is being so shaped and sys
tematized that with a few more ses
sions to clear away the vast quantity
of preliminary matters the work will
proceed smoothly and rapidly. The
various important committees held
their first meetings this afternoon at a
half-dozen different churches and
made a fair start in the business be
fore them. The resignation of Ser^R"
Bishop Stephen M. Merrill of Chicag*
was presented to the conference and
referred to the committee on episco
pacy, with instructions to report to the
General Conference, with resolutions
commendatory of the great service
Bishop Merrill has rendered to the
church in his fifty-nine years as min
ister and Bishop.

OF INTEREST TO PEOPLE
OF THE PACIFIC COAST
â¢'Detailed dispatches to Bradstreefs
j show a dispositon to conservatism in
: buying both for reorder purposes and
I for fall delivery. Eastern jobbers are
\ inclined to take a more favorable view
i of trade, now that good weather is
! stimulating the retail demand.
"Hides are firm. Labor troubles cur
Â¦ tail activity in lumber and building
materials in some centers. Copper
Â¦ tends downward on enlarged produc
i tion and less eager demand.
"Wheat, including flour, exports for
[the week ending May 6 aggregate
! 1,192,718 bushels, against 1,101,950 bush-
J els last week and 3,201,680 bushels this
j week last year. From July 1, 1903, to
j date, they aggregate 122,899,855 bush
i els, against l&0,095,165 bushels last year.
"Failures in the United States for

I against 188 last week and 175 last year.
j In Canada failures for the week num
j ber IS, as against 24 last week and 15
i in this week a year ago."
R. G. Dun &- Co.'s weekly review of
trade to-morrow will say:
I "Somewhat better retail distribution
! has followed improvement in tempera
â¢ ture, but it seems too late to recover
j any large part of the tardy season's in-
I jury to spring trade. Quiet conditions
j are noted in practically all lines of
! wearing apparel. Operations for fu
! ture requirements are carried on with
| caution, and this disposition to avoid
j excessive commitments will do much
j to reduce the number of failures. Some
I improvements in collections, particu
i larly Â£t- the. South -and .West, will
| strengthen weak concerns. The per-
I centage of idle factories has increased.
: especially in textiles and footwear, and
; a change in style has rendered una
: vailablo much silk machinery. Struct
\ ural work is increasing, but dealers
j had accumulated large supplies or
! building materials, and prices lack
; seasonable firmness. Commodity prices
I declined slightly during April. Rail
| way earnings in April were 5.8 per cent
j lees than last year.
"Recovery in iron and steel indus
tries is again retarded by the unexpect
ed dissolution of the ore association.
"After â¢ last week's exceptionally
heavy transactions it was natural that
j the Western hide markets should be
; come inactive. Prices remain firm,
; however.
"Commercial failures this week in the
i United States are 206, against 202 last
\ week, 241 the preceding week and 176
i the same week last year. Failures In
: Canada number 17, against ' 16 last
\ year."
NEW YORK, May 6.â Bradstreefs
to-morrow will say: "The expected
good weather has at last materialized
and has helped farmers and retail trade
in seasonable goods. Crop prepara
tions and planting has made especial
ly good progress, the present outlook
being that while the winter wheat crop
will be short, the acreage in spring
wheat, oats and corn will be heavily
increased.
"Retail and wholesale trade, how
ever, has not experienced the stimula
tion earlier looked for, there being a
disposition so far to regard results as
below expectations. The iron trade is
quieter, with prices distinctly weaker.
On the other hand, less than the usual
number of May day strikes have oc
curred, and this year so far makes a
more favorable showing than did 1903.
Failures are little more than normal
in number. 0
A wreck train .was blown from the
railroad track near " Crescent and
George Sommers and William Apple,
negro laborers, were drowned. Twenty
houses were wrecked at Moran and
half a dozen at Putnam. Hundreds of
head of livestock are reported killed in
Shackleford and adjoining counties.
Crops were badly injured by the wind,
rain and hail. Wire service is still
badly crippled and reports as to further
fatalities to-night are still incomplete,
but it is believed that lives were lost in
isolated places that will swelljthe total
number to twenty. Railroad property
has suffered heavily in the northwest
Texas storm area. '
ST. LOUIS, May 6.â A special to the
Republic from Houston, Tex., says:
Storm news Is coming in very slowly,

have been many deaths in different
parts of the State. Among the known
dead are Will Perry at Harrisburg,
killed by lightning; Mrs. Allen Dennis,
G. /W. Mason and a child of S. T. Har
per of Goldthwaite. Luther Rudd, Al

child and Joe Griffith are also badly
hurt at the latter place.
The damage to cotton and corn crops
will be heavy. The damage to property
will run into the hundreds of thousands
of dollars. \
At Ruby, John Mullen's house was
wrecked. Mr. and Mrs. Mullen were
carried nearly 100 yards by the wind
and Mrs. Mullen is beHeved to be fatal

SACRAMENTO. May 6.â Seated to
a ward in the County Poorhouse,
George Miller was kept busy to-night
answering telegrams from his lawyers
with reference to the affairs of the
million-dollar estate in Brooklyn, N.
Y., of which he discovered last night
he was an heir. Miller was visited to
night at the County Hospital, as the
home for the sick and indigent 13
called, and to The Call correspondent
'told his story
"A month ago to-day," said Miller,
"I arrived in Sacramento without a
cent of money and stopped at a cheap
lodging-house. I had been ill. but had
apparently cured myself with simple
remedies. But soon after I came to
Sacramento I found I was afflicted
with typhoid fever and that unless I
received care I would die. An ac
quaintance told me I should apply to
Supervisor Brooke for a permit to en
ter the County Hospital, and I did so.
I had a terrible siege, but although
I was without a friend or a cent of
money the doctors and nurses were
good to me and you see I am well
again, though a trifle weak. I learned
last night through a telegram received
by Superintendent White that my
father, Charles Miller, had died in
Brooklyn. N. Y., leaving a million
dollar estate, of which I as his only
son am one of the heirs, with my.
mother and six sisters.
"I have read in the dispatches to
day that I had a. falling out with my
father. That is not the case. I was
an entry clerk and tea taster In my
father's great wholesale house in
Brooklyn. In June, 1900. with my
father's consent, I started for San
Francisco on a steamer by way of
Panama. I landed in San Fran
cisco with $2250 In my pockets. I
will not tell what I did with the
money, but I spent much of it and
later in San Luis Obispo I was robbed
of the rest. I was ashamed or rather
too proud to write to my folks for
help. I went to work as a track
walker for the Southern Pacific at
Santa Barbara at $1 50 a day. Then
I worked for contractors as a laborer
on railroad construction work and
afterward as a miner In Mariposa
County. I have worked very hard, but
I never asked my relatives for a cent.
It always was my intention to return
home, but after I was robbed in San
Luis Obispo I resolved to earn my
money by my own labor, but it was
no easy matter, I tell you. I suppose
my folks would not have heard from
me for some time if it had not been
that a friend of mine in the East, to
whom I recently wrote, told them of
my presence here. I shall return
East, probably Wednesday night. My
father expected^to retire from business
in January, and so until I return East
I cannot tell whether I shall take up
his business or what I shall do."
Miller is 31 years old. He shows
the eftcts of his long siege of fever,
but is rapidly regaining his strength.
Special Dtsuatch to The Oil.
The rainfall along the Kansas River
Valley has been comparatively light,
and as the fall north of here was not
great, it is believed that the Missouri
River will carry off the excess water
and that no flood damage will result
along that stream.
The rainfall in this vicinity for the
past twelve hours amounted to slightly
over four inches. The rainstorm extend
ed from Brunswick, Mo., to Wichita,
Kan., but was most severe around
Kansas City.
At Rosedale many persons had to bÂ»
rescued from their homes, but no one
was drowned nor was any one hurt.
Train service was demoralized on
several railroads and one train, tho
Southeastern Limited on the Frisco
road, southbound, was stalled for eigh
teen hours.
KANSAS CITY, May 6.â The flood
situation here was greatly Improved
to-day, although a steady rain contin
ues to fall. No further damage is ex
pected. The city's water supply, which
had been materially lessened by the
breaking of a big water main and the
damage done to another was practi
cally restored to-day and street cars
are again running. At Rosedale. Kan.,
a suburb, the several hundred families
who were driven from their homes re
turned to them to-day, the water ha\*
ing receded and the bridge connecting
the stockyard district with Armour
dale, which was threatened, is now be
lieved to be safe.

PERSONAL.
The board adopted a resolution to
tender a reception in honor of Miss
Alice Roosevelt during her intended
visit to St. Louis. A resolution, intro
duced by MIes Helen M. Gould, was
adopted to tender a reception in the
Woman's building during the" latter
part of May to the officers of the army
and navy who are affiliated with the
exposition.
has decided unanimously that the pic
tures of prominent women of the Uni
ted States shall be hung on the walls
of the Woman's building. This decision
was reached with the provision that the
pictures collected must be those of
bona flde prominent women, and that
they must pass an inspection to be
made by a specially appointed commit
tee, the personnel of which is not to
be revealed. About 400 pictures have
been collected, all of which had re
ceived the approval of the former
president of the building, Mrs. James
A. Blair.
our new citizens looked and were
greatly impressed with the evident
friendliness of the acquisitions and
their simplicity of dress.
A Sioux chieftain and some of his
family called on the Igorrotes yester
day. The chief wasn't half as much
impressed with them as they were with
him. He said It was positively shock-
Ing and that if he had known the, true
state of affairs he wouldn't have
brought his wife along. The people
from across the Pacific wanted some of
the native American's beads . and
feathers, but the Americans saw noth
ing around that they wanted and de
parted as soon as courtesy would per
mit.
One of the most interesting exhibits
in the Igorrote, quarter Is a true model
of the sleeping apartments used by
them in the islands. Tnls is a struc
ture about as high as an average coun
ter. It has a hole in the side big
enough to admit the passage of a hu
man body. This is the only opening
in it. Fires are built inside and after
the Interior is well heated the fires are
extinguished and the "natives crawl in
to "slumber. ' Thirty-seven Igorrotes
have been sleeping, packed closely, in
one of these structures here during the
cold weather. They come from elevat
ed portions of the Philippines, where
the atmosphere is at times very cold:-
The raising of Alaska's totem poles
is another sight that draws crowds.
These hideous relics, which bear' on
thefr surfaces the history of families
who won fame In thefr native land by
deeds of valor and in their interiors the
ashes of departed warriors and mighty
hunters, have a strange fascination for
visitors to the fair. Governor Brady
is asr proud of them, as he Is. of the
rhubarb crop of Southeastern Alaska,
which he says is immense. He worked
hard in" securing the totem poles and
has shown that he knows something
about the exhibition business. A single
totem pole is something that attracts
the eye and a forest of them certainly
makes a unique sight. -
* Just to show the incorrectness of
the statement* made at the time that
America was only- getting an ice box
from Russia when it purchased Alas
ka and that no good would accrue to
this country from It, Governor Brady
has had prepared a gilt -.cube repre
senting the $22,000,000 gold output of
Alaska, and this is displayed promi
nently in comparison with the $7,200,000
paid for the northern territory. The
gold output, together with that of fish
and furs, and not counting: the. rhu
barb at all, make a story of Alaskan
riches that is opening the; fcyes of the
world to the possibilities of the. land

box, but which has proven; Itself-, a'

Preparing to Celebrate the Fourth.
NAPA, May 6.â The celebration of
the Fourth of July in Napa this year
will be in the nature of a general gath
ering of companies of the Uniformed
Rank Knights of Pythias. Four com
panies from San Francisco and one
each from Berkeley, Alameda and East
Oakland and two from Oakland have
decided to come to Napa. The Vallejo
canton of the I. O. O. F. and several
others will come. Large purses hare
been hung up by the committee for ex
hibition drills.
The Congressional Commission that
came down . from . Washington on the
opening day went over to look at the
Philippine exhibit as a matter of duty
an 1 education. The .members called on
the Ifforrotes-Just'to Bee r how some of
The Igorrotes from the Philippines
are a star attraction. Their "corral,"
as it is called, lies in a forest of maples
at one corner of the Philippine grounds.
Their World's Fair home consists of a
number of thatched huts inside a bam
boo fence. They seem pleased with
visitors, though they refuse to dress
much to receive them. Their lack of
wearing apparel has not attracted the
attention of any organization, but their
penchant for roast dog has awakened
the Humane Society. The Igorrotes
love dog and any pups that wander out
toward their, inclosure never see mama
again. The Humane Society has been
thwarted up to date throusrh the fact
that the Igorrotes are just outside the
city limits. The yelp of the disappear
ing pup is still heard in the night and
the Government meat bill is lessened
thereby.
FILIPINOS ARE ATTRACTIVE.
"I intend that those who are really j
interested in the industry ehall sample
our best wines, that they may learn, if
they do not already know, that no spot
on earth produces any better wines than
those of California. For those who love
good wine there can be no stronger ar
gument made for California's product
than its sampling. Those who visit the
temple will also be instructed as to
prices, shipping, production and every
thing else that may be of interest to
them and of aid to the industry. Cali
fornia's wine producers, are going to
reap much benefit from the actual dem
onstration that will he made here."
SHIPMENTS ARRIVE SLOWLY.
No wine shipments have yet been
made for this exhibit, but the material
will be sent on Ifs soon as the structure
is ready. All varieties and grades of
wines will be shown.
San Joaquin and Los Angeles counties
were the first among those represented
in the Agricultural building to be ready.
Both had their displays completed
before the opening day.
The crown xvaM placed on the tower
of San Francisco's building last Thurs
day, and the structure now stands
completed in outline. The painters are
at work. Without any unforeseen draw- j
backs the building will be ready very j
soon after the middle of the month, j
Some delay has been caused by the i
failure to arrive of the redwood, of i
which the Â£*tair railings, baseboards, I
doorE and window casings are to be i
made. This material has been on the
road two weeks, and the carpenters are
ready for it now. Outside of 'the work
that is.to be finished with this redwood
thoy are practically finished.
The staff workers have nearly all the
ornamentation ready and much* of it
is up.
Architect Newsome left here three !
weeks ago, and since that time there
baa been no one here to represent San i
Francisco. The work would have been
facilitated had there been some one
from San Francisco in charge. Con
struction has gone ahead steadily,
however, the contractors keeping a
large force of men at work.
From the tower of the San Francisco
building, which rises 100 feet from the
ground, a panoramic view of the
grounds can be obtained. A flagstaff
will surmount the tower. The San
Francisco building will be a prominent
object, visible from every direction.
CALLFORNIANS STARTLED.
The interior finish, owing to the lim
ited aroount of money subscribed, will
not be as handsome as could have been
desired, but it will look very well. The
rafters are left uncovered, but they
wi^l be painted. A K tongue-and-groove
pine ceiling would perhaps have en
hanced'.Xjie interior view.
Califomians were surprised to hear
the other day that the first fresh
grapes at the fair would be shown
by New York State. They were re
lieved, however, when they learned
that these grapes had been In cold
storage all winter. Refrigerator grapes
do not alarm the Pacific Coasters.
Throngs hang about the displays of
fruits made by California and many
heads are shaken in wonder. Many
would be shaken in doubt if only word
of mouth told of these marvels of hor
ticulture, but with the tangible evi
dence before their eyes the strangers
to California must cast all doubt aside
and eive expression to admiration..
"Mine will be a campaign of educa
tion," said Mr. Haber to-day. "I want
to teach the people from sections where
wine does not flow as it does in Cali
fornia that the Juice of the grape does
not produce intemperance. Statistics
show that less drunkenness exists
among wine-drinking people than
among those of other sections. Wine
drinking in moderation is beneficial,
and crime and degradation never thrive
where the grape purples under the sun
of autumn.
EDUCATION ON WINES.
ST. LOUIS. May 6.â Work on the Cal
ifornia wine display structure In the
Agricultural building of the World's
Fair is in progress, and with any sort
of luck the gorgeous golden temple of
the grape that is to represent this won
derful California industry will be ready
in about three weeks. Ferdinand A.
Haber, chief of the Department of
Viticulture of California, who has
charge of this display, has worked en
ergetically, but has met the same ob
stacles that have confronted all
exhibitorsâ scarcity of labor, inability
to get material delivered and the bad
weather. The staff work is nearing
completion and the various parts of the
temple are well under way. Mr. Haber
thinks California is going to be finely
represented in this line and is confident
that great good will result to the wine
industry from the exhibit given and
the sampling that will be done.

Supervisor Brandenstein proposed
that a commission on the adornment of
the city be elected, the officers of which
receive no salaries. Dr. Taylor of the
Board of Freeholders" made .a strong
address upon the ugliness of telegrraph
poles. and wires, the ununlform manner
in which houses are placed beside the
sidewalks and suggested that the tele
graph companies be forced to lay their
wires underground.
Yesterday morning Mr. Burnham was
entertained at an informal reception
given by the San Francisco Chapter of
the American Institute of Architects.
He was the honored guest at a luncheon
at the Pacific-Union Club, at which
William Bourn, was host. The luncheon
was attended by several friends. â
Major Randolph suggested that the
Presidio be Improved in order that it
may be a pleasure ground for the peo
ple of the city. Mrs. Baldwin of the
California Club maintained that more
attention should be given to the streets
and that better schoolhouses be built-
Supervisor Braunhart said that the
beauties we already possess should be
preserved before other plans are made.
Mr. Stader of the Fairmount Club sug
gested that the city start a zoological
garden in the city, as there is none ex
cept that at the Chutes.
' Mrs. Wagner, representing the Out
door Art League, reported that her as
sociation was enthusiastic over its re
cent victory in the "preservation of Tel
egraph Hill, and promised that in all
resolutions adopted for the adornment
of the city the Outdoor Art League will
be ready to give assistance.
received. * .
Daniel Burnham next took the floor.
He'" explained that in order to make
any headway in the beautifying of the
city public spirit and enthusiasm must
be aroused, and that all citizens should
do their, utmost toward carrying out
the good work. He said that no artist
could be Inspired into doing his best
work unless indorsed .by public sym
pathy and enthusiasm. Burnham ex
plained that he was not present to
speak, but to hear suggestions from
those assembled. .
The Maple room of the Palace Hotel
was crowded with representatives from
the various improvement associations
of this city last night to offer and re
ceive suggestions that may lead to the
beautifying and adornment of San
Francisco.
Daniel H. Burnham of Chicago waa
the honored guest of the evening and
he made the opening remarks.
James D. Phelan acted as chairman,
and after introducing Burnham read a
communication from Bruce Porter.
Porter was unable to be present, so he
sent a letter in which he suggested that
Pierce street, from Bay to Haight, be
converted into an avenue between the
succession of small parks and squares
of which it forms the main axis, and
that trees be planted on both sides;
that hills too steep for traffic be made
into observation points and resting
places, and that there should be more
parks and playgrounds south of Mar
ket street. The communication was well

TOUR COUNTIES All).
While the California State Board of
Trade special train will go through to
St.- Louis without change, after the ex
tursionists reach the exposition they
will not come back in a body, but will
return home by the various routes.
Reservations on this train should be
made as early as possible, as the time
is now very short, through the Califor
nia State Board of Trade, ferry build
ing. Secretary L. M. Fletcher will of
ficially represent the California State
Hoard of Trade on the train and at St.
Louis.
St. Louis will be reached at 8 a. m %
Monday. May 16. This special train of
California citizens visiting the exposi
tion in a body will be of great value to
this State, for the excursionists can
do considerable missionary work while
ia St. Louis. The California State
Board of Trade for a number of years
lias done and is doing a valuable work
in the way of bringing the desirable
class of people to California.
The California State Board of- Trade
excursion to the Louisiana Purchase
Exposition at St. Louis will leave San
Francisco at 11 a. m. next Friday in
one of the finest Pullman trains that
hsu? ever left this State. L. M. Fletcher,
secretary of the California State Board
cf Trade, who has just returned from
a trip throughout the central and
northern rortions of this State, where
he has been interviewing ihe Chambers
cf Commerce and Board? of Trade, as
veil as prominent business men . and
citizens, reports that a number of the
Chambers of Commerce and Boards of
Trade will send official representatives
on this train to represent their cities
;xnd counties.
While it was recently reported th^t
the exhibits would not be in position
until the latter part of May, more re
rent advices state that nearly all will
lÂ»e placed by May 12. The California
>*:ate Board of Trade special train will
make an exceptionally fast run.
DELEGATES -FROM INTERIOR.
* Stops will be made at Sacramento to
receive a delegation from that city and
the northern part of the State, and at
Colfax. where the citizens from Nevada
Oiiy and Grass Valley will board the
train, and at Reno to receive a delega
tion from that city. After that the
train will make no stops excepting at
division points where engines and
crews are changed and at the larger
cities en route.
A score of Questions met the same
fate, and Schlesinger had to give It
up. Leon Samuels, Herbert Clarke and
Walter K. Slack were brought back by
Heney for further cross-examination.
The additional point was brought out
that envelopes of the sort used for one
of the anonymous letters to Secretary
Hitchcock were lying about the Hyde
offices in quantities when Dimond took
desk room there. Knight made another
effort to implicate Samuels and Slack
with, the 'anonymous letters and there
oy provoked some angry answers from
each. No new evidence, however, tend
ing to show that they wrote the letters
or that Dimond did not, was brought
out. Both of them testified that Hyde
had told them that he engaged Di
mond as "a confidential man."
"How many witnesses have you in
terviewed in the State of Oregon while
you were working up this case?" the
famous secret service man was asked.
"I decline to- answer." snapped Burns,
tired of saying the rme thing so
often.
"Your Honor, we ask that the wit
ness be Instructed to answer."
"We object," shouted Heney.
"Objection sustained," said the com
missioner.
Schlesinger made, the next move, re
calling the three Government witness
es, William E. Valk. Woodford D. Har
lan and Benjamin F. Allen, who told
the Grand Jury at the Federal capital
that they had been bribed to further
the Hyde-Benson land transactions.
Each admitted in answer to the ques
tions of Hyde's attorney that he was
still in the employ of the Interior De
partment, but each denied that he had
any understanding with his superiors
as to retaining his job. Then Schlea
inger called Detective Burns back to
the stand, where he had already a doz
en times refused to give information
as to what evidence the Government
may have besides that presented to
the Grand Jury.
BURNS IS XOT TELIJNG.
Bert Schlesinger, of Hyde's counsel,
asked a few questions to show that
Dimond, while acting as Hyde's attor
ney before the General Land Office,
had not sought to expedite any Hyde-
Benson lieu selections that he knew to
be based on fraudulent State titles. To
all these queries the witness made sat
isfactory answer and then with an aud
ible sigh of relief left the stand, where
he had been testifying for nearly three
weeks. Knight announced that the fol
lowing well known citizens were ready,
if called upon, to swear to Dimond's
good reputation: James P. Langborne,
Henry J. Crocker, Ex-Judge C. W. Van
Fleet. William R. Wheeler. Edwin New
hall. Charles L. Patton, Willis G. Dodd,
Curtis H. LIndley, J. B. Stetson. Al
fred Stillman. Thomas Cole, Wilfred
B. Chapman, William M. Pierson, Sam
uel B. Welch, -George R. Shreve and
Morris U. Bates.
DIMOXD IS RELIEVED.
The business at bringing the land
frauds hearing to an end is proving
almost as long as the rest of the case
has been. With attorneys anxidus to
get away to other matters, however,
the question whether Defendants Hyde
and Dimond shall be held for trial at
Washington will probably be finally
submitted to Commissioner Heacock
early next week. An indication of Hea
cock's diminishing patience was shown
at the close of yesterday's session when
he announced that on Monday he
would sit at 10 o'clock instead of his
usual hour of 10:30.
The lc-ng ordeal of Henry P. Di
mond's cross-examination ended yes
terday. On returning to the stand he
answered "No" to Heney's question
whether he had read the account of
the hearing on May 2, printed in The
Call of the following morning, which
exclusively reported his errors in writ-
Ing "ownes" for "owns" and "dummys"
for "dummies." The question suggest
ed a possible reason for the witness*
improved spelling the next day. DU
mond, however, dropped the admission
that on leaving -court after his first
writing exercise he had said to his
counsel, Wheeler, that he believed he
had misspelled "owns," and that this
must have been due to" the deep im
pression left on his mind by ttie same
misspelling in the anonymous letter to
the Secretary of the Interior. He had
previously testified that he had merely
glanced over the epistle in question.

known under many aliases, among them Guy
LeCroix. Guy Williams, Guy Edingscourt' and
Bruce Van Drake. The fact that he : so fre
quently, concealed his Identity' under names of

SpÂ«cla! IXspstch to The Oil!.
Peaches â Early varieties, such as
Alexander, Hale's Imperial and St.
: John, show well generally, crop fair.
; Early and late Crawfords, Foster, El
; berta, Susquehanna and other similar
! midsummer freestone varieties are very
light, not more than a third of a full
crop. Yellow midsummer clingstones,
such as the Chili, Lennon, McDevltt
and Orange, will not produce a quarter
of a croj. Levy, Phillips and George
! late clings, varying reports^ the last
being almost entirely short and the
others about half a crop or less. Sal
ways (late freestone), usually heavy
bearers, may produce about one-half a
full crop. â¢
Pearsâ Generally full.
Grapes â Never looked better. Crop
seems to be assured.
Olives â Blossoming fully.
Oranges â Trees just coming into
blossom. Their late bloom always se
cures a good crop here, and the early
ripening of Washington navels (the
only kind now being planted here ex
tensively) always secure good prices.
It may be judged from the above that
the California orchardist who is within
easy reach of a good market may rea
sonably expect fair profit for the sea
son's work.
The season's shortage has been
brought about by the sterilizing of the
blossoms by the recent long-continued
storms. If an expanded fruit blossom
catches and holds a drop of water for
several hours the moisture destroys
the pollen and prevents pollenization,
or if the fruit forms it will not mature.
When an orchard is In blossom long
continued rain is worse than a frost,
as the latter may catch one or more
varieties, but seldom destroys the en
tire cropâ in fact, it has never done so
in the Newcastle foothills.
Cherries Are Shipped From Placer.
AUBURN, May 6. â The first box of
cherries from Placer County this sea
son went forward Thursday from Loo
mis. The cherries were of the
Knight's early black variety and were
grown in the Pine View orchard. The
cherry crop and pear crop in Placer
County promises well, as do also
early peaches. Plums and midsum
mer peaches, however, were badly
hurt by the recent long cold rains. The
apricot crop is also short. The grape
and olive crops will be large. Grain
of all kinds is looking well and never
before was grass more abundant.
PEACH YIELD LIGHT.
Cherriesâ Early red varieties good,
but plantings limited. Black Tartarian
crop medium; Knight's early black, fair
crop; Royal Annes, Centennial, Bing
and Advance, not short, but a little
light; black Oregon, full crop.
Plums and Prunesâ Very full crops.
Hungarian or Gross prunes and ogohs
are full; Tragedy prunes, usually light
bearers, show good crops in many or
chards; Bur banks (a favorite), light in
many places; Diamond plums show
well, not many here yet; WIckson, Bur
bank, Diamond, Satsuma, Botan, Kel
seys and others very lightâ probably on
the whole there is one-third of a crop.
Apricots â Hardly an eighth of a crop.
Berriesâ Production of strawberries
has nearly ceased. Japanese competi
tion st Florin and elsewhere has nearly
killed the industry for the present.
Respberries, dewberries and blackber
ries, excellent crops.
The present condition of the fruit
crops is shown by the following report
received here:-.
The crops are already beginning to
move and in a few days shipments will
rapidly increase. Before the berry and
cherry crops are gone apricots, plums
and peaches will be on the road In car
load lots and the shipments will in
crease steadily until the daily output
will amount to entire trainloads.
CROPS BEGINNING TO MOVE.
The shortage seems to be general,
j but there are some exceptional cases.
Newcastle produces Ad ships to the
East a greater quantity of fresh de
ciduous fruits than any other section
! in California. The condition of orchard
| matters at this point can be regarded
; as reflecting the condition of the
'â¢ Northern California orchards as a
I whole.
j The Newcastle orchardist is fortu
! nate in having at his door a splendid
' market, as- all the leading fruit ship
ping houses of the State are repre
sented here, as well as some of the
largest local dealers of fruits in the
State. In seasons like the present the
leading canneries are also in the field
therefore the grower may sell at
home at the highest prices every
pound of fruit he grows, or if a sea
son promises to be a good consignment
year, he mav^take chances and ship
his produce to the Eastern cities.
NEWCASTLE, May 6. â The orchards
In the Sierra Nevada foothills in
Northern California are among the
most fertile and productive in the
State. From that section the bulk of
fresh deciduous fruits of the State are
shipped to the East and elsewhere.
The- crop of 1903 from that section was
about one-half in quantity compared
with the crop of 1902, but the present
season's output will fall far below that
of last year. There doubtless will be
some consolation to the producers and
fruit shippers in the knowledge that
reports from the Eastern, Middle
Western and Southern States indicate
that there will be a good demand for
California fruit this year and that re
turns from either f. o. b. sales in Cali
fornia or In the Eastern .auction mar
kets will be of a satisfactory nature
and that the less than one-half of a
full crop will net a larger profit than
was realized from the full crop of
1902 and possibly nearly or quite as
large a profit as in 1903.

ENTERPRISE, Or., May 6.â The two
desperadoes, supposed, to be Dick
Barkley and William Gale, who robbed
the Imnaha Postofllce and then sur
rendered to a lone sheepherder, under
thG v deluslon that he was the leader of
a posse, are still at large. sThe bandits
were encamped in the brush Thursday
at midnight when a , band of cayyses
stampeded and rushing through the
brush made the robbers believe they
were^ being . surrounded. When the
sheepherder appeared the desperadoes
tamely. gave, up their rifles. He con
ducted them to his camp, where their
suspicions were aroused and, after a
few questions, they learned that no
posse was * about. The sheepherder
thereupon was forced to cook a supply
of food for the bandits, after which
they; tied him' in his cabin and fled
( toward Snake River. Barkley and
Gale served time in the penitentiary
for . train robbery, but were pardoned
by Governor Chamberlain. Â¦ ( . ,

It was only after a hard eearch and the
running down of many clews that Constable
Krum and Deputy Sheriff Cooper of TCeswick
and myself located the cabin at the mine oc
cupied by the robbers. There we discovered
evidence of the fact that the men. while In
hiding, had stationed lookouts to watch every
approach. It was shortly after finding; the
cabin that we got our clews that led to the
Identity of the three men and verified suspi
cions that we had entertained for some days.
Since them w e have vigorously pursued
them, and all but had them In our grasp on
April 28, when George Gates got a tip that
we were after him. In the meantime, through
the assistance of Sheriffs and their "deputies
and constables in various sections of that part
of the State and. my own force of men, we
have been rapidly accumulating evidence which
shows that for nearly eight months these men
had been engaged in hold-up work. They were
involved in the holding up of a saloon at Edg
wood in February, and the same month â¢ they
robbed a saloon In Kcnnett.. Further Infor
mation we have received regarding their ope
rations farther north convinces us, as well
as the Oregon authorities, that Â¦ two ! of the
men, one of them George Gates, were the same
that robbed an electric car In Portland some
time ago. ..when two* passengers were killed.
We have" also traced them to Seattle, where
another robbery occurred. The descriptions in
each instance compare accurately with those
of the men we are now looking for. .
CHARGED WITH MANY CRDIES.
According to the information in the
possession of Agent Crowley, George
Gates is badly wanted in Amador
County on a charge of robbery in Jack
son on April 11, 1902. On that night
a merchant, returning home from his
store, was held up by a masked man
and escorted back to his place of busi
ness, where It was , the evident inten
tion of the robber to compelrfkim to
open his safe. -. . .
Unfortunately for the plans of the
robber the merchant's partner was still
in the store and when the partner saw
his business associate enteT, quietly
with a masked man he reached for ; a
shotgun and sent a charge of shot into
the side of the robber, who, however,
managed to escape. For the capture
of Gates in connection with this crime
IDENTITY IS COMPLETE.
We have followed very closely every clew
In this case and have ample evidence to fully
establish the connection of the Gates and Ar
nett with the robbery. After blowing: up the car
and k'llinsr the messenger the three men
forced the engineer to carry them on his en
gine to Keswlck, where they left the engine
and crosxed the river. They Immediately doubled
back a few yards below, crossing the river
acain en a pipe line to a point on the river
side, where their tracks were lost the follow
ing mornlnff. We afterward found that they
had proceeded along the outskirts of Keswick
and finally reached a rendezvous in an aban
doned mine at NlBBer Hill, quite remote from
civilization. At this place they had previously
camped at intervals during a period of more
than three months, and from there, we will
be able to show, they went out on different
jobs, amoge them several robberies, Including
the hold-ups on two different occasions of the
Wcavervllle sta~e.
Of their connection with the Copley
robbery and the killing of Messenger
O'Neil, Agent Crowley said yesterday
that there is not the slightest doubt
that the Gates boys and Arnett com
mitted the crimes and will be conviced
when captured. Crowley and his as
sistants, William Ahern of Sacramento,
Patrick Kindelon of this city and
Sheriff J. L. Richardson of Shasta
County, have been working constantly
on the Copley robbery since the night
of its commission and it !s mainly due
to their untiring efforts that the crime
was finally traced to the Gates boys
and Arnett and plans for their capture
devised. Discussing the affair yester
day Crowley said:
TRACED TO LOXELY CABIN'.
Edwin Vernon Gates is 21 years of
age and was raised in Alameda County;
but, owing to his waywardness, he has
become well known in Chlco and Shasta
and Siskiyou counties. Arnett is only
24 years old, but more of a hardened
fellow. He was born in Modoc County,
was raised at Klammath Falls, and is
well known throughout the upper sec
tion of the State from Shasta north
ward and in Southern Oregon. He
began his career as a r.iiner. but soon
drifted into the habits of the lower
order of gamblers, and is regarded as
a thoroughly bad man.
The last seen of the trio was in Jack
son County. Oregon, April 22, where
they were "hoboing" along the route of
the railroad In the direction of the
northwestern boundary of that State.
On April 2S Special Agent Crowley and
several of his assistants planned to
capture the three men, but George
Gates, in some mysterious manner, be
came advised of the fact that the pur
suers were close on his trail and he
and his companions disappeared.
The Gates are brothers and the sons
of.G. G. Gates, a prominent mine
operator In Amador County, who is a
highly respected resident of Alameda
and a man who has long suffered hu
miliation by reason of the wayward
careers of the two young men. George
Gates Is the elder of the two and
possesses a high degree of intelligence.
He has been identified with mining in
Amador County, where he spent the
early part of his life, and is well known
in Oakland and Alameda, where he has
taken an active part in athletics and
earned for himself the reputation of a
clever boxer.
BROTHERS ARE SUSPECTED.
Three men are wanted for the Copley
robbery, and while the search for them
is proceeding the detectives of the
Southern Pacific Company are piling
up evidence of a most damaging char
acter, which not only connects the trio
with the affair of March 31, but with
previous robberies that occurred in
Northern California and in Oregon dur
ing a period of many months. The men,
for, whom nearly every peace officer, in
Northern California, Oregon, "Wash
ington, Montana, Wyoming, Nevada
and Utah is now looking, are George
Gates, Edwin Vernon Gates and James
Arnett, all of whom have been more or
less identified with crime in this State
and Oregon for several years, but who
have so far escaped imprisonment, al
though badly wanted in a number of
sections.
The identity of the men that held up
the southbound Oregon express at
Copley, Shasta County, on the night
of March 31 and, after killing Messen
ger W. J. O'Neil, blew^up his safe and
demolished the express car with dyna
mite, has finally been thoroughly estab
lished. Yesterday, through the medium
of C. C. Crowley, chief of the railroad
special agents, the Southern Pacific
Company, with which Wells, j Fargo &
Co. is co-operating, inaugurated over
the entire coast a hunt for the robbers,
which is expected to soon result in their
qapture and punishment for the many
crimes of which they are strongly sus
pected.

night the disappearance of her 10
year-old daughter, Birdie! during the
morning hours. The motner left the
child at her store and went as far as
the express office to transact some
business. When she returned a short
time later the door of the shop was
open and her daughter gone. A num
ber of articles of clothing belonging
to the latter were also missins.
Mrs. McGinnis says she then visited
the home of Mrs. McComb at 812
Sixteenth street.- where the child had
been in the habit of going. Mrs. Mc-
Comb told the anxious mother that
little Birdie had been there and stated
that owing to trouble between her pa
rents she was going to her father, who
is in Fresno. Mrs. McGinnis said the
story of the parents' separation is
true, but whether the child went to
Fresno the mother has not ascer
tained.

turned his classes into a sewing bee.
This, of course, is all very annoying

Arcangements have been made to
hold the first meeting at the Pacific
Theological Seminary on Sunday next
and future meetings at Stiles Hall until
a church building Is secured.
"I did everything In my power to
reconcile the factions," said Dr. Coat3
to-day, "but there are some things
that never can be mended. Each side
thinks it is conscientiously right! We
have not questioned the right of any of
the others to think as they please. No
harsh things have bÂ»ert said and there
will be no open quarreling. It Is mere
ly a difference of opinion."
In the meantime the old church. Is
not without a pastor. There are now
two "ministers among the congrega
tion, the Rev. John Barr and the Rev.
CM. Jones,, who will supply the pulpit
until another pastor Is called. The
leaders of the majority faction refuse
to talk about the affair, preferring that,
'the troubles be ended with as little
talk as possible. Dr. Gilbert Shepherd,
a deacon of the church, ; said to-day
that there was no need for discussing
the affair and therefore declines to
talk, a position which he ' declared
would be assumed by. Â£11 the other
"prominent . members of the congrega
tion. - i+ : M ' - ;*' -^
Cards of withdrawal were asked for
by the minority, composed o( some
fifty members. Wednesday evening of
this week and last night a new con
gregation was formed at a meeting in
the home of E. R. Barnes of 2220
Bancroft way. Dr. Coats, having cast
his lot with the minority, was called
as pastor, the following o^her officeâ¢
being elected:
The factions first manifested them
selves four years ago, but the differ
ences became more acute a year ago
when the minority sought the removal
of the pastor, the Rev; R. Lv Halsey.
on the ground that the church was not
making progress. But the majority
prevailed and Jhat led to the Informal
withdrawal of the minority. Dr. Hal-
Bey remained as pastor until last No
vember, when he accepted "a position
as Government interpreter at Hawaii.
After Dr. Halsey's withdrawal the
minority returned to the fold and
sought a voice In the policies of the
church. It sought most of all for the
recall of two Sunday school classes
that had withdrawn with it from the
church at the time of the quarrel over
Dr. .Halsey. But the majority refused
to accept the classes so that there was
nothing else for the minority to do
but to take permanent leave. The
Rev. A. S. Coats, who had been acting
In Dr. Halsey's place, bent his efforts
toward a 'reconciliation, but met only
with failure.
BERKELEY, May 6.â Months of
quarreling have ended at last in a com
plete schism in the First Baptist
Church. The final step was taken last
night when the minority faction met
and formed a separate congregation.
It was all done very peacably, however,
and with the knowledge of the major
ity. Neither side Is so bitter that it
steks to disparage the other and the
factions deplore the whole affair, while
still maintaining their positon. The sum
of it all. is that the congregation was
not compatible and amicable disagree
ment was considered more appropriate
than open warfare.

Charges that a husband's brutality
had caused the insanity of Mrs. Cor
nelia I-enx led the Lunacy Commission
ers t<> postpone the hearing to-day un
til children of the unfortunate woman
can be called before the commission
to testify.
T. K. Taylor, Mrs. Lenz's brother,
was responsible for the accusations
against the husband, who is Louis L-
Lcnz, en employe of the Alameda
Street Department, with residence at
540 Palace court, Alameda. Taylor re
taineti Attorney E. M. GibsÂ»on this
morning to handle his interests, and to
the lawyer he declared that Mrs. Lenz
had been driven mad because of her
husband's ill treatment. Taylor pro
duced a leather thongr, which, he said,
had been used in beating the woman.
Attorney Gibson said: "Further than
the h.isty conversation I had with
Taylor. I am uninformed about the
case. He was very anxious to have the
three Lens children taken before the
Commrssione*-', claiming they had fre
quently 5ntt4fered when the father
was attacking the mother. I made
representations to the Commissioners,
and the Sheriff was directed to pro
duce the children to-morrow morning."
Taylor resides In San Francisco.
Lenz a?5erts that the story of cruelty
iÂ« made out of whole cloth. He tells a
story of domestic suffering borne of his
wife's mental disturbances that is far
from indicating brutality.
The accused man declares that for
many months his wife's mind has been
failing, but because of affection for
her he hesitated to have her taken from
home.
Lenz for six months had been com
pelled, after a hard day's work, to
attend to all of the household duties,
cook meals and care for {he children.
His nif* continued to prow worse, and
he moved to his mother's home that
she might assist in watching over the
demented woman.
Lenz had Dr. T. P. Tisdale to at
tend h!s wife. The physician bears out
the husband's statements.

was taken in charge by local under

Every attention was given Dasha at

HIS Broadway, May 6.
Wiliam F. Dasha, the San Francisco
dep*uty sheriff convicted of conspiracy
in Chinese substitution cases, died at
8 o'clock to-night at the Receding Hos
pital, where he was taken yesterday
afternoon from the Alameda County
Jail suffering from acute heart trouble,
the effect of pneumonia.
Dasha failed rapidly from the time
he began his term of one year's im
prisonment a week ago to-day. He
was so tar gone last evening that the
jail physician, Dr. C. L. Tipdale, said
there was no hope for the patient. At
the hospital to-day oxygen was used
constantly to stimulate respiration, but
the sufferer grew weaker and weaker
until death ended his pain this even-
Ing.
Mrs. J. C. Heacock, a young married
woman, turned heroine this morning
and paved her home at 213S Woolsey
street from destruction by fire. With
an Intrepidity born ef a desperate de

treasures she had taken years to gath

that threatened- destruction and hurled
it. through a window into the open air.
She. was rot a moment tc-o soon, for

Mrs. HeicockVect of heroism follow
ed the sudden Ignition or the oil atove
while she was engaged in cleaning it
this morning. A spark frc-m a match
fired the oil and suddenly a sheet of
flame shot high into the air. The flame
burned the young woman severely and
almost blinded her, but she did not lose
her presence of mind.
First snatching up her baby that was
playing about the floor, Mrs. Heacock
ran to an adjoining room and placed
the infant out of danger's way. Then
she grabbed a blanket from a bed and
hurriedly running back threw it aver
the burning stove. The names were
already licking the woodwork near by.
but they were Instantly smothered by
the blanket. And although the stove
was red hot, Mrs. Heacock picked it
up and threw it into the back yard of
her home, just in time to prevent its
exploding In the house: The fire depart
ment was summoned, but by the time
it arrived there was no fire to put out.

I made the accusation charging Supervisor
Rowe with misconduct In office in behalf ot
the taxpayer* of this county who wont good
government and a JuÂ»t expenditure of thÂ«
moneys they pay as taxes. While the char;-s
In my accusation cite but few cases of over
charges and in the aggregate do not amount to
much, still it remains a fact that this Super
visor's overcharges reach away up In the hun
dreds of dollars, and It Is a fact. also, tnat
his mileage overcharges are trifling compared
with some of thtse of ether members of this
board. During the past year Supervisor Rowe
claims to have made and taxed the county for
fifty-nine trips of from twenty-two to thirty
eight miles each In length In going to and
coming from Claremont Road District, which
adjoins the city of Oakland, and for slxty
sÂ« ven tr!pÂ«. from twenty-six to forty-two miles
each to Piedmont Road District, which also
adjoins this city. He charaed and collect-i
for eighty-two visits to the tunnel, which Is
by road seven and a half miles distant from
ths City Hall, for from twenty-four to thirty
eight miles each trip, and for h!s slxte-n
trips to San Francisco, which we all know is
but eight miles from Broadway, he charged
and collected for from twenty-six to thirty
two miles each. His charges for mileage are
mtstly all fabrications, though sworn to. Ail
I care further to Â«ay Is that this ts the first
of a " series of prosecutions to be launched
against local malefactors In office, both city
and county
Until the charges can be compare*
with the itemized bills no one can
say whether they are corrept or not.
It is known, however, that C. S. Mac-
Muilan has been going over the expense
items of the Board ft Supervisors.
Besides overcharging in the number of
miles alleged to have been traveled, a
number of charges aggregating $5 60
are enumerated where he has charged
for traveling from his home to the
Courthouse In excess of the number
of meetings allowed to be charged for
by law. It sets forth that the board
is allowed meet but five times in
each month, while he has charged for
as many as eight trips.
In addition to the charges, Gull
bault makes the following statement:
An accusation was filed this after
noon with the Coanty Clerk against
Supervisor H. D. Rowe charging him
with having overcharged the county
in his mileage bills to the extent of
$38 50 within the year and asking for
his removal from offlce. The charges
are made "by J. E. Guilbaalt. a tax
payer. v.ho Bays that his only purpose
in bringing the action Is for the good
of. the public. Supervisor Rov.e is out
of town and a statement could not be
obtained from him. Attorney Reese
Clark represents Guilbault-
Guilbaclt begins his complaint by
stating that in August, 1903, Rowe
charged' mileage to .Sacramento and
return, placing the distance nt 102
miles, whereas the distance is but IS 2.
His bill was allowed for $19 20, where
as it should properly have been for
$16 80. the overcharge being $2 40.
Twenty-seven instances of the same
sort are enunfferated where the over
charges run all the way from 60 cents
to $2 40 and aggregate a total of
$3S 50.
Friends of Rowe state that the ac
tion is begun by political enemies of
his with the intent to do him harm
in the coming election, Rowe having
announced himself a candidate for re
election. It is also said that Rowe
aroused considerable antagonism by
his action in fighting against the prop
osition to put in an expensive vault in
the Treasurer's office at an exorbitant
figure and that this has been taken
as a means to get revenge upon him.

The committee decided to meet
Wednesday next at 10:30 a. m. to con
sider the appropriations of the De
partment of Elections and on Tuesday
at 1:30 p. m.. when the Board of Edu
cation, will be heard.
Braunhart also took the commission
to task for buying desks without au
thorization from the Supervisors.
Commissioner Devoto said the desks
would be returned to the seller and
the Supervisors would be asked -for
the necessary permission to purchase
them.
The entire appropriation asked for
by the Department of Elections is
$253,056, of which $130,000. is for vo:
ing machines, $127,556 for salaries and
conduct of elections and $1500 for in
cidentals.
Braunhart hinted at the recent vio
lations of the civil service law by the
Election Commission by urging the
committee to require the commission
to file a list of its employes and that
no provision be made for them unless
they are on the civil service list.
Supervisor Braunhart called atten
tion to the fact that a special election
would probably be held this year for
voting on a bond issue for an auxiliary
high pressure salt water system, the
expense of which election would be
$12,000.
FOR SPECIAL. ELECTION".
The Election Commissioners urged
the committee to provide funds for
200 voting machines in the conduct
of the elections. It was figured that
twenty machines Would effect a saving
of $7600 yearTy and forty machines
would save $11,200 in salaries of 400
election officers, reduction of precinct
registration- and other items every
year.

Captain H. Z. Howard, superintend

pany, who was recently complimented
by being^ selected to act as JtdgÂ« in a
matter in which he was financially in
terested, has returned a verdict by
[ which he virtually orders himself to
pay out a substantial sum of money.
A few weeks aro a launch belonging
j to W. a. Boole & Son. Incorporated,
! ran into and sank a launch belonging
j to Thomas Crowley & Bros. The Crow-
I ley launch, badly damaged. Tras lo
! cated by a diver, raised and is now be
ing repaired at considerable expense.
The men running the launches blamed
i each other for the accident, and the
I owners, net caring to take the matter
j into ccurt. asked the United States In
i specters to make on investigation.
j These gentlemen, however, have all
; they can attend to keeping track of the |
I troubles of vessels within their juris-
I diction. They refused to make the in- j
j vestigation.
Crowiey said he would be willing to

experienced man. and when Captain
Howard"* name was suggested declared
himself satisfied if Captain Howard
j would consent.
>>"ow. Captain Howard is a stockhold
er in tfce Boote business, but when this Â¦
| was called to Cro-svley's attention the '
I launch owner said that he had every
confidence that the captain's integrity
was of too sterling a stamp to allow
j personal interest to interfere with an
i honest judgment, and that by Captain
I Howard's decision he was prepared to
abide.
Captain Howard has handed down j
his decision. He reached the conclusion !
that each boatman contributed a share
of the carelessness which caused the
! collision, and ordered that the cost of
repairing the CrowJey launch (the Boole
launch was uninjured) be divided
equally between Thomas Crowley &
Bros, and W. A. Boole & Son, Inc. This !
virtually gives Crowley a verdict for |
half the amount he would have claimed I

At this point Chairman Brandenstein
asked E. P. E. Troy, who was present,
if he had any requests to make.
"Well, I would like the committee to
appropriate about $2,000,000 to buy the
Geary-street railroad," said Troy.
"Well," said Brandenstein. "that is a
subject that should be considered some
day by itself. If you will arrange for
the conference we will be glad to meet
you."
"Well. I would do so." said Troy, "if
I was assured that I would . not be
â¢jobbed.' "
"What do ycu mean by that?" asked
Brandenstein.
"Well, I received notice one day that
a meeting of the Judiciary Committee
would be held on a Friday, and when
I came here I found it had been
changed to Thursday by order of the
clerk of the board," said Troy.
"Why, that is not true," saia Clerk
Fay, rising excitedly. "I ought to

County Clerk Greif asked that pro
vision be made for ten book typewrit

The loose-leaf system would entail a

Fodera's financial straits are said to
be due to his having taken over the
Clarendon Hotel, which recently failed
and closed its doors, and also engaging
in the restaurant business in addition
to his poultry business.
It is claimed that Fodera will pay
cne hundred cents on the dollar if
given time to do so and his creditors
may deem it advisable to consent to
that proceeding.
The fact that Antone Fodera, a prom
inent dealer in poultry and game at
526 Montgomery street, Is in financial
difficulties and may fail was divulged
yesterday as the result of a writ of
attachment served oa him at the in
stance of D. A. Curtin, who Is acting
for a third party. The amount of the
attachment was $375 ST and represented
the sum of a check signed by Fodera.
payment upon which was refused by a
bank because he had no fund3 on de
posit in the institution.
The attachment was served in the
absence of Fodera and a keeper placed
in charge. It was given out that the
total liabilities of Fodera will aggre
gate a sum in excess of $5000, but that
he had $7500 outstanding on personal
accounts. Some difficulty, however,
would be experienced in collecting the
full amount cf outstanding debts.
A meeting of the creditors of Fodera
was called for next Monday at the
Board of Trade rooms when some set
tlement will probably be arrived at in
order to allow Fodera to continue busi
ness. Fodera's bookkeeper was anxious
that the attachment be not served ass
it might result in other creditors tak
ing the same action â¢ and result In
forcing his employer into the bank

ADVEBTISEMESTSLAll for Iko.
Lieutenant Fasaki of a Japanese war
ship writes to his wife: "After all there
is plenty of luck in battle, and a fellow
of good luck cannot die even if he wish
to. For instance, a sh*ct or ball cannot
hit a lucky dog like me. On the occa
sion of the fight of February 9 the only
things I had in my bosom were the
charm, you sent me and a photograph
of Iko (the lieutenant's "eldest son).
During the fight I took my post on a
barbette and directed the flre of the
broadsides; but when the range had
increased I ordered to cease firing.
Then I t*ok out Iko's photograph and
turned its face toward the scene of the
battle, addressing it as if it were Iko in
person. 'If as a result of this war.' I
said to it. 'the situation of the Far East
is firmly fixed and no war should occur
during vour lifetime, then you might
think yourself born in vain as an of
ficer's son. Therefore you should care
fully observe this scene even from
your photograph, so that the' sight may
inspire in you the proud warrior spirit
worthy of aÂ«man. , If. however, fortun-i
favors you a chance of being un
der fire, as I am now. then there is all
the more reason to observe the scene
carefully for your future benefit.' "*â¢â

MALT-1L F. O-. City. Malt Is made
from barley. Its manufacture Involve*
several processes â namely, sleeping,
couching, sweating and flooring
and kiln-drying of the grain. For
steeping the grain is put into large
wood2n or cement cisterns and covered
with water enough to allow the grain
to swell thoroughly. The steeping
las^s about sixty-five hours, or until
the grain is well swollen and soft, when
the water is drawn off and the grain
is thrown on the couching floo'r in a
heap. There it lies for twenty-six
hours or more, until the temperature
rises to â¬0 degrees and the grain begins
to give off it3 absorbed water. This
is called sweating. The point of germi
nation is at that time,' but it is soon
checked by flooring the grain, which
is spread and respread upon the floor,
turned with a spade and spread out
more and more at each spreading. It
is then spread in a kiln bavins a per
forated floor, through which & current
of hot air rises. There it remains tea
days., the temperature being increased
from 50 to 140 degrees, and is turned
over frequently, or every hour or two*
This stops the process of rermtnatioa
and the malt is ready for use In tha
brewing process.
Harnessing Lightning.
To harness the electricity on Pike's
Peak and by means of a metallic cir
cuit conduct it to the base, there to
be stored for use as motive power for
the cog road â that is the scheme of
the Manitou and Pike's "Peak Railway.
The proposition, according to the
general manager. Mr. Sells, is feasible,
and affords the only practical means
of , employing electricity on the cog
road. aVV.'^K:/
The one obstacle in the way of car
rying out such a plan Is the static
electricity with which the air is
charged * above the 12,000-foot point.
The fact that Pike's Peak overtops all
the surrounding mountains makes it
the natural grounding spot for elec
tricity that would otherwise be dissi
pated over a large area.
In the ordinary trolley line power

GENERAL KUROPATKIN is still explaining the
Russian reverses on the Yalu. Even from the
meager thus far given out no military
training is required to make it plain that the battle was'
one of the great actions at arms that will, figure in his
tory. The fact that the Japanese carried completely a
Russian position of first importance is proved by the
elaborate works and entrenchments in which they found
and from which they drove the enemy.
Kuropatkin takes -pains in every report and explana
tion to dwell upon the Japanese superiority in numbers.
But he does not emphasize the other factâ that the
Japanese crossed a river to assault a force protected
behind vast works and with its- artillery permanently
mounted and capable of instant and deadly service.
When an 'army is behind protective works, with artillery
light and heavy, one soldier is equal to ten in a force
that makes the assault. In fact, from a military stand
point, the advantage was with the Russians.
One feature that persistently recurs in Kuropatkin's
reports would be amusing if anything so grievous as war
can furnish amusement. He puts blame upon General
Kashtalinsky, whom he says he directed to retire with
out fighting. This is echoed by the' Novoe Vremya's
military expert, who says Major General Kashtalinsky's
report proves clearly that the Russians should haveTre
tired. "Retire" is a military euphemism for "retreat.?
AH critics will agree that the Russian army would hot
have been whipped if it had not fought. "But why had
months and money been spent in works to protect its
position on the Yalu if it was not the intention to make
a stand there?
The Japanese desired to cross the river in force at that
precise point. The Russians had foreseen/this and made
costly preparations to prevent a crossing/Why, then,
should they retreat without firing a gun and let the
Japanese cross in^ peace? .There is no^doubt that the
generals who opposed the crossing and opposed it
bravely and vainly were acting upon the original "plan to
defend that part of the river where the Japanese
cross, if at all. It is useless to palliate what happened,
nor is it brave -or wise to minimize the action of the
Japanese by harping upon" their superior numbers. "They

Because my brain might addle!
If I could speak, they would be shocked;
I'd call that fiddle-faddle.
And yet. of course, they ought to know â
Still. I can't help but wonder
If some one rocked them years ago
When folks were apt to blunder.
They stand around me. looking wise.
And say they must not pet me;
A pentle pat to soothe my cries
They claim would further fret me.
My raising must conform to hiw
Down to each jot and tittle â
Did people hold them off with awe
When they were bald and little?
They say that bouncing me is sure
To make me very nervous.
That children's frames cannot endure
Such sadly thoughtless service.
Yet these phlegmatic scientists.
Ere they began to toddle
Were bounced until their chubby fists
Played tattoos on the noddle.
When I stretch out my willing arms
Inviting them to frolic.
They rise in wondering alarms
And talk of croup and colic â
It's hard to be a baby now;
They will not pet or Jump us.
And when I sleep, my peaceful brow
Must lie straight with the compass.
When I grow up, of course I'll be
A triumph scientific;
But really it seems to me .
My hard luck is terrific
If I could only speak my* mind â
But then they would not thank me,
One unbanned custom they would find â
They still think they may spank me:

Going Some.
Mercantile clerks with many letters
to write to India tradesfolk are to be
pitied. The following, picked at ran
dom from the books of a London firm
doing business in India, are not at all a
bad specimen of the general run of

Manthri Pragada Suryanarayana.

Peruvayel Coomaleeswarenpettah Ra

Thus put, the names do look strange
and savor something of being a terror
to the English man or woman who tries
to pronounce them. But if words were
dividedâ divided as they rightly may
beâ instead of being run together, there
would be no confusion. "Muttukumara
swamy" is an* awkward word to pro
nounce, but "Muttu Kumara Swamy"
has nothing to cause any one any trou
ble. Again. "Vijayaraghavacharriar"
seems a jaw-breaker of a word; it Is
euphony Itself when properly divided
into "Vljaya Raghava Charriar." Why,
I wonder, d6 not Hindu gentlemen in

r A Colonial Calf.
In 1631 Thomas Dudley, deputy
Governor of the colony it Massachu
setts Bay. wrote the Countess of Lin
coln a letter of nineteen pages. In
which he tells her an incident in the
early history of the colony that would
otherwise have been forgotten. It
goes to show that the Puritan fore
fathers, even the staid magistrates,
had some humor. The matter was
fresh to the mind of the writer, for he
closes his letter by saying. "I am now
this 28th day of March, 1631. sealing
my letters."
"Upon the Twenty fifth of thia
March, one of Watertown. having lost

Regenerating Egypt
"Egypt." says Lord Cromer in his
annual report on that country and the
Soudan, "is in a state of transition and
the problem of adapting the whole
machine of government to meet the
wants of a society which is almost be
wildering in the variety of its com
ponent parts becomes daily more com
plex."
There is, however, nothing bewil
dering or complex in this report,
which is a fascinating and lucid sum
mary of the economic and social con
dition of Egypt to-day.
Lord Cromer has not only in hand
the financial regeneration of a coun
try which Ismail Pasha left burdened
with a debt of Â£100,000,000. but the
task, which requires far more adroit
ness, of transforming the vacillating
Egyptian into a good citizen.
The bond which united the former
rulers and the ruled in Egypt was, on
the one hand, reliance on superior
force, and, on the other hand, the
fear engendered by the abuse of that
force.
"Stated in the most general terms."
says Lord Cromer, "the main object to
be pursued was manifestly to substi
tute another bond in i>lace 6f that
which had existed. The new bond had
to consist partly in the contentment
of the mass of the population, partly
in the gradual growth of confidence in
the intentions of the rnlers and partly
in the establishment of the conviction
that the Government was strong."
This has been the basis of British
policy in Egypt. an d Lord Cromer can
now say with confidence that "at no
former period in their long history
have the. people been so prosperous or
so contented as at present."
The official body as a class have yet
to become accustomed to the use of
the weapons which a civilized system
of government has placed in their
hands. They have yet to learn that
there is a middle term between the
exercise of unbridled authority and
the weakness which shuns all respon
sibility.
"Time, patience and the application
of sound, just and reasonably liberal
principles should enable all the dif
ficulties which may arise from these
and similar causes to be solved with
out resort to any heroic remedies. On
this solid basis the superstructure
can now be improved and completed
in such a manner as time and experi
ence may necessitate."
How exceedingly sound the financial
management of the Khedive's admin
istration has been may be judged by a
glance at the illuminating and under
standable figures which Lord Cromer
has incorporated in his report.
Every penny of the eight millions
which have been spent during the last
eigtueen years on canals and irriga
tion has-been charged to revenue, and
the Suakln-Berber Railway, estimated
to cost one and three-quarter millions,
will be paid for out of the accumula
tions of past years. ,
An interesting sidelight on the so
cial life of^the country is afforded in
the section devoted to marriage.
The great facility for divorce al
lowed by Mohametan law tends more
than any other single cause to under
mine family life in Moslem countries.
I am inclined to think that the prac
tice of divorce, equally with that of
polygamy, is diminishing, but that
large numbers of Moslems still avail
themselves of the provisions of the
law to get rid of their wives cannot
be doubted.
During the past year 176,474 cer
tificates of Moslem marriages were
registered. There were 52,992 cases
of divorce. In other words, for every*
seven women married there were
rather more than two divorced.
In a great many cases, however, the
husband takes his wife back again
after divorcing her; and as in these
cases a new certificate of marriage is
not necessary, the reunion does not ap
pear in the statistics. â London Ex

VARIOUS and numerous stories have been pub
lished of the fight between the Japanese fleet
and the two Russian ships bottled up in Chemulpo
harbor, but the Sunday Call to-morrow will contain, ex
clusively, the first official report that has been received
in America. v
It was written on the day of the great one-sided
fight immediately after the sinking of the Variag and
the Koreitz, by* W. A. Marshall of the United States
steamship Vicksbtirg, senior officer commanding, who,
with his ship, was stationed in the harbor at the
time and was, therefore, a keen and critical eye-witness
of all that took place.
In it he tells how* Captain Roudnoff sailed out with
band playing to meet, the whole Japanese fleet of two
battleships, six cruisers and twelve torpedo craft, and
was battered to pieces in one of the most heroic naval
battles in all history, of the damage done by the Japanese
fire and later by the Russians themselves, and how the
"men of the" foreign fleet went to the rescue of the
Variag's survivors after they had been abandoned by
the Koreitz before, she herself was blown up. *
This long and minute report was sent to the com
mander-in-chief of the United States force on the Asiatic
station, and besides being official makes ifp one of the
most interesting accounts ever written of a modern
battle viewed from the calm, cool, unexaggerating stand
point of one who is himself versed in the science of
the terrible game.
As to the awful havoc wrought the photographs, which
were taken immediately after the battle, exclusively for
the Sunday Â¦Â¦ Call, show how one of the finest warships
ever built, and which had seen only eighteen months
of service, now looks, lying near the torn and battered
hulk of her sister ship, the Koreitz.
Taking the war zone in a sweeping circle there is
also an article in the Sunday Call to-morrow written
by Eli T. Sheppard, former United States Consul Gen
eral to Chinkiang during the Chino-Japanese embroglio,
who writes of "Port Arthur, the Tragic Monument of
Li Hung Chang's Diplomacy," which gives the secret
history of the forts that are now holding the Japanese
at bay with such grim tenacity.
Following the zone still farther round the circle there
is a story of the Philippines from the pen of Albert
Sonnichsen, who served with the American forces, and
therefore knows. of what he writes at first hand, entitled
"When Lawton's Charger Ruled Vigan."
Swinging back around the circle the Sunday Call will
present the first installment of three full illustrated
pages of Headon Hill's exceptionally powerful nove[ of
Russian life, entitled "By a Hair's Breadth," which
rather sensational title gives no idea of the sweep and
strength and serious revelations of the story itself. It
is indeed a novel of rare interest just at the present time,
while the eyes of the whole world are focused on St.
Petersburg, for it tells of the plot and counterplot that
keep the Czar in constant jeopardy and how marvelously
be is safeguarded by the dreaded "Third Section."
Switching off * at a slight tangent there js an article
from the pen of Maynard Shipley on the "King of
Kings," on justice and crime in Abyssinia, under the
all-powerfuj Menelik II. This article is especially im
portant in view of the negotiations now being conducted
with the United States.
Making the circle of the world complete and coming
much nearer home, the Sunday Call to-morrow will
print an article on "Record Breaking Automobiling in
California," which not only tells of a remarkable feat
just accomplished but illustrates it with one of the most
striking photographs ever taken. It is so large that it
fills up the whole page from -top to bottom and from
corner to corner.
And, in the line of summer fashions for men and
women, which is quite apropos, there is a lull page on
the correct dress for gentlemen, illustrated with a full
list of photographs, and a full page for the gentler sex,
in fact two full pages, both completely illustrated with
the finest half-tones ever reproduced in the West. One
is "The Picture Veil/' which is a chic and sensational
novelty, ,- and the other, under the heading of "What
Women Want to Know," is "The Sweet Scented Satchet
Bag" â how to make it and how and when to use it and
when not to use it. .
And on page 15 Jerome K % Jerome has one of the
cleverest articles that ever came from his pen. entitled
''Beauty by the Bottle," which will create no end of dis
cussion between men andVomen for obvious reasons.
Pictorially and artistically the'Sunday Call to-morrow
will be of unusual interest. There are two full page
multiple color pictures that will find their way into
frames on the walls of manv homes.
THE SUNDAY CALL MAGAZINE.
The harbor police are having considerable difficulty in
suppressing that peculiar parasite of seaports, the bay
pirate. Fortunately there is very little of harm left in
the wharf pest except the romance of his name, and that
is not even formidable enough to inflame the imagina
tion of a small boy. And there is not a small compen
sation in the fact that the "pirates" give the police an
excuse for exercise.
THE feeling of public anxiety that existed during
the pendency of the issue between the Carmen's
Union of San Francisco and the United Railroads
was caused not only by past experiences here, but by a
knowledge of the- losses caused elsewhere by long, and
bitter strikes. This feeling of anxiety was shared by the
carmen themselves. What we escaped may be measured
by the results reported by the New York State Bureau
of Mediation and Arbitration on the strikes of 1903.
These numbered -192, against 142 in the preceding year.
The losses far exceeded those of 1902, when they were
572,285 working days. In 1903, the number of employes
affected was 117,000 and they lost 3,900,000 days' work
and wages. In the building trades strike 37>O37 em
ployes lost in wages $6,754,751. In all the disputes and
consequent idleness of the year, workmen lost over
$10,000,000 in wages. y
The loss to business is incalculable. The delay, in
building, loss of rents and interest, the extra insurance
risk, the slower movement in real estate, the insolvency
of many enterprises and the effect of doubt and uncer
tainty that pervaded, business and industry made it a
year of stress and tj&l in New York. It is no wonder
that out of it all conservative men, like. John Mitchell
and Mr. Buchanan, are led to declare that the economic
loss of strikes far exceeds the advantage usually gained
by them. The experience of New York was nearly
duplicated by Chicago, where, it is said, the loss in
wages and other collateral sacrifices have made a deep
and damaging impression upon the progress of the city.
Looking upon the record of these distant disturbances
and counting up the losses under which other cities
wince and flinch, and making a study of the causes :Qf
it all, we may see how near San Francisco came 'to letd
ing off the industrial year by a similar experience.- But,
instead of that we have led off in a condition of fair
industrial peace, brought out of a situation which threat
encd-a prolonged and costly war.
It mny be expected that other cities will be attracted
by our success in escaping causes which have made
them suffer so bitterly. Capital, which is timidly in
flight from storm centers where its investment is unsafe,
will be led to investigate the better conditions* which
promise safety for it here. All interests, of labor and
capital alike, are safer where there is industrial equilib
rium and a degree of freedom under the law. It 'is
fortunate for San Francisco that the streetcar issue was
so long pending that it attracted attention throughout
the Union, and that other cities, judging by their own
unhappy experiences, were confident that a peaceful issue
was impossible.
When peace did come, on terms honorable and satis
factory to both sides, those who had expected the oppo-
Mte result were informed and educated as they would
not have been if the matter had acquired only local
notoriety. The contrast is so marked between what
was peacefully settled here and the carnage and de
struction that raged around the streetcar systems of
Chicago and St. Louis that investors are sure to be at
tracted to this city, where reason and right thinking
are in control of employers and employes.
Disorder -is infectious. Man is an imitative animaj,
and methods good or bad adopted by masses of men
infect other masses, leading to widespread disorders.
The streetcar men, by keeping the middle of the road,
using their own common sense, and the officers of the
United Railroads, by showing a rare capacity for looking
on both sides cf an issue that' so mightily concerned
them, have set the pace for the year. When that pace
has become custom and habit to those who take it, a
great example is set, making for the peace and pros
perity of other years to come.
We do not hesitate to say that the settlement was
worth millions to San Francisco, , not " merely by pre
venting the sad waste of a strike, but by the good repute
with which it invests the city.
No Room for Him.
In replying * to the toast. "The Pro
gressive Jew," at a banquet where sat
a mixed assemblage of Jews and gen
tiles the other night, John Rosenfeld
amused his hearers with the following
anecdote:
"A few days ago," he said, "a can
vasser called at my office and urgently
requested an interview. The man was
well dressed and had the gift of gab
in fact, he was Â«n artist in his line. He
bowed himself in, and without waiting
to be invited seated himself in a chair.
After the usual Inquiry on my part as
to what I could do for him, he said:
" 'Mr. Rosenfeld, I am a canvasser
for a new work that is about to be
published in New York by an eminent
scholar from Poland; it is on the life
and history of the Wandering Jew.
The publishers are very desirous of
having the work introduced In San
Francisco among the more enlightened
Hebrews, as it will in a measure do
away with considerable of the prejudice
that exists against our race. The sub
scription is only a matter of $5. and to
such a public spirited Jew as yourself
it will have interest. "What number of
copies will I put you down for?'
"I was astounded at the man's gall,
and before waiting to hear further from
him I rang for the bookkeeper, and
when he entered the room I said, 'Give
this man $20. and see here.' I said to
the canvasser, 'keep that book In New
York, and keep that "Wandering Jew
on the move until doomsday. We
Jews in America have no use for any
more wanderers; we are happy and
content, and have found the. happy
land long promised to Moses. We have
no room for wanderers, but plenty of
places for industrious Jews.' "
Her last instructions were to this
curious effect: .
â¢â¢1 desire that my coffin be not made
of oak, or of any durable wood, but,
on the principle of earth to earth bur
ials, of the lightest and most perish
able materials, merely sufficient to
carry my body decently to the grave,
and without any ornament or inscrip
tion whatever. I desire to be carried
to Llanelltyd Cemetery, not in. a fun
eral hearse, but in one or other of my
own carriages, driven by my coach
man, at his usual pace. And I desire
that neither then nor at any other
time may my friends or servants wear
mourning: for me."
Apropos of this strenuous woman's
death, a literary acquaintance of mine
recalled a use of her name by Darwfn
to which Huxley often made laugh
ins reference. Speaking of some man
who had just perpetrated a screeching
anti-vivisection pamphlet, Darwin re
marked that he wrote "like a female

arxd Williams was allowed to walk out
Â«f the hospital a free man. Judge
Fritz at once issued a bench warrant

The fault lies either with Detective
Taylor or the hospital authorities and

the -blame upon the proper person.
Burglars in Butcher Shop.
Denis Gallagher was booked at the
City Prison yesterday morning by Spe
cial Officer R. T. Harvey on a charge
of burglary and Paul Durney, a boy
11 years of age, was booked for a pub
lic institution. Harvey found the boy
hiding in an icebox in the butcher
shop of Fred W. Held, 1303 Buchanan
street. The boy confessed that he and
Gallagher had broken into the place
and Gallagher had tried to force open
the safe. Gallagher was found later.
The most important matter for dis
cussion at the session of the Grand
Jury yesterday afternoon was the un
lawful selling of liquor by saloon-keep
ers whose f places of business are in the
neighborhood of the Presidio entrance
on Baker street.
The saloon-keepers of that, neighbor
hood are only licensed to do wholesale
business, but it is said that a retail
trade is openly carried on in all the
shops. Soldiers in uniform can always
be seen" loafing in the many barrooms
or lounging about the tables and bar3
Inside. It is said that they are given
all the liquor they want, but should a
well-dressed citizen ask for a drink he
would be told that the house was not
allowed to retail liquor.
The state of affairs was made known
by The Call several months ago, but
though the police have been informed
time and again of the unlawful trade
no effort has been made to. put a stop
to it. -," v.t V;
Several members of the Grand Jury
that were told of the retail business
being carried on dressed themselves in
shabby attire and visited several of the
bars in question. In all of them they
were served drinks in glasses. The
Grand Jury will submit the matter to
the Police Commissioners, with instruc
tions to investigate.
At the suggestion of the Board of
Public "Works the Grand Jury yester
day Instructed the Department of Elec
tricity to repair the electric wiring in
the Almshouse, as the present wiring
is extremely dangerous.
The Grand Jury also approved the re
cent action of Judge Conlan and the
Fire Commissioners in the matter of
Thomas Commins and William Mur
phy, two firemen charged with bur
glary. The case was dismissed.
Police Commissioner H. W. Hutton
Is fighting hard to free himself from
punishment for the alleged violation
of the injunction issued to Jean Pon
restraining the police from interfering
with his restaurant business at 1129
Dupont street.
When the contempt proceedings
against Hutton were called before
Judge Cook at noon yesterday his at
torney, HJ^Tm Johnson, Interposed a
demurrer to the effect that the af
fidavit of Pon did not state facts suf
ficient to " constitute contempt and
that the court had no jurisdiction in
the matter or over the person of the
respondent.
Johnson argued at considerable
length in support of the demurrer. He
said it was evident on the face of the
petition and affidavit that the respond
ent was hot a party to the injunction,
nor did it run to him as a servant or
employe of the-'party or parties en
joined. As the respondent was not a
party to the, injunction nor described
in the injunction he could not be held
in contempt for violating it.; The per
sons enjoined were the Chief of Po
lice, a captain, of police, a sergeant
and all policemen. It did not run to
any Police Commissioner. He quoted
a Nebraska case. where the Mayor, al
though knowing that an injunction
was In force, Instructed city employes
to violate it and was purged of con
tempt.
Attorney Collins replied that the
Nebraska case referred to did not ap
ply, as the Mayor did not advise any
of the parties enjoined to violate the
injunction. In the Hutton case the
respondent was being. prosecuted for
aiding and abetting those enjoined to
violate the injunction and this made
him an accomplice.
After further argument the Judge
asked both sides to submit authorities
and he would render his decision on
Monday morning. The other contempt
cases were continued till that time.'
Police Commissioners Howell. Drink
house and Reagan were in court to
testify as to the proceedings at the se
cret meeting when it is alleged Hutton
was made "special Chief of Police for
1129 Dupont street," and they were
told to return on Monday morning.

Numerous Authorities Are
Submitted and Decision

the man took the money from her lap
as she sat in an invalid's chair and
then hurried away. An. effort to con
vict him of grand larceny was frus
trated by his pleading guilty to petty
larceny. .
Amos Buffum, chauffeur, was without
license to run his automobile, the Scar
let Scorcher, when he left the vehicle
standing on Bush street, between
Kearny and Dupont, and entered a
saloon to refresh himself with a drink.
But that was only one of the charges
connected with Amos Buffum's name
on Judge Fritz's calendar. "Another one
was "malicious mischief," and it Is the
text {of the story.
No sooner was Amos comfortably
leaning uÂ£>cn the bar and pouring out
his drink than the machine at the door
suddenly snorted and started .ferry
ward at a fifteen-mile-an-hour clip. Its
speed was accelerated by the steepness
of the declivity and as it crossed
Kearny street it was like unto the
proverbial streak of greased lightning.
Not until it neared Montgomery did it
swerve from the straight and narrow
asphalt, and then it abruptly switched
into the tailoring shop of J. R. Smith,
damaging the front of that establish
ment and injuring its own gear. There
It coughed and sputtered until Patrol
man Skelly rescued it and arrested
Amos Buffum as soon as he appeared
to claim his property.
Amos Buffum failed to appear yes
terday morning before Judge Fritz and
his $30 bail was ordered* forfeited. The
Scarlet Scorcher is undergoing repairs.
Sergeant L. H. Hoffmaster, United
States artillery, was fined $20 for dis
turbing the peace, while Private W. H.
Miller of the same corps was taxed
treble that sum for the same offense.
Judge Cabaniss heard the cases.
The defendants were among the pas
sengers on an inward bound Hyde
rtreet car, , and engaged in an
altercation with GriDman Jackson
that resulted in their expulsion
from the vehicle by a police
man called for that purpose. They were
landed in the heart of the tenderloin
district and Jackson triumphantly re
sumed his journey. On his return trip,
however, the car was boarded in mili
tant fashion by the two defendants
end several other sons of Mars, and
when the gripman endeavored to re
sist the invaders he was roughly hand
led by them. Then the two arrests
were made.
Private Miller was fined $60 because
it was proved that he had hurled a
brickbat at the gripman's head, and
that the missile missed its target by a
hair's-breadth. Sergeant Hoffmaster
utilized nothing more dangerous than
his hands anfi tongue during the at
tack.
Nicholas Kelly's ingenious plea
failed of intended effect upon Judge
Fritz and a sentence of three months'
imprisonment for pettty larceny was
handed down.
Mrs. Jette Weinstern was removing i
her household effects from a house on
McAllister street when Nicholas picked
up her coat from the sidewalk and
walked off with it. To the policeman
who arrested him Nicholas declared
that he was merely searching the â¢
pockets of the garment for a screw- |
driver which he had lost and had no !
intention of stealing it. This explana- |
tion he repeated to Judge Fritz. '
"If my memory Is not at fault," said I
his Honor, "you were once convicted
of stealing a bicycle and I gave you six
months." * i
"That's what you did. Judge,"
cheerfully confessed Nicholas, "but I
was as innocent of that charge as I am
guiltless of this one. The bicycle was
standing in a hallway when I stumbled
over it and as we rolled out to the
street together a policeman arrested
me for stealing it."
"If your ingenuity were honestly
exercised it would bring you vast
wealth," said the court
Mary Quinn. her husband and their
two children occupy the second story
of 28% Geneva street and the first
floor harbors the \ household of Mr.
Burke. Between the two families
there has been unkindly feeling for
some time, the cause of which was
Variously explained to Judge Mogan.
before whom Mrs. Quinn stood ac
cused of disturbing the peace of the
Burkes, with Mr. Burke pressing the
charge. He stated that Mrs. Quinn
was given to frequent overindulgence
in intoxicants and while under their
influence did everything she could
think of that might annoy him and
his family. A favorite act of hers was
to drop ashes from the rear balcony
of her domicile upon the garments
which Mrs. Burke had washed and
suspended upon a line to dry in the
yard below.
"The old man is all right, your
Honor," said Mr. Burke, alluding to
Mr. Quinn, "but the old woman is a
howling terror."
Mrs. Quinn instantly bridled up and
denied the impeachment "My old
man's an old soak," she shouted, "and
I'm a good girl."
"Guilty of peace disturbance and
passing of sentence deferred till Mon
day," said the Judge.
Parental neglect was never more un
naturally exercised than by Ole Go
gadus and his wife Georgie toward
their five-year-old boy. They left the
child alone at their home. 1063 Howard
street, on the morning of Friday, April
2S. and did not return again until last
Thursday evenics, when they were ar-,
rested on Harrison street for drunken
ness. For six days they had evidently
been oblivious of their offspring's ex
istence. The little one had not eaten
anything for three days when his con
dition was discovered by neighbors. He
was almcst famished, and his prompt
removal to the City Receiving Hospital
probably saved bis life and averted a
charge of infanticide against his par
ents.
Policeman Kruger told the story yes
terday to Judge Mogan. and Officer
Young of the S. P. C. C. corroborated
It in every detail and added that Gk>
gadus and his wife are habitual drunk
ards and had previously neglected their
child in a shameful way. The man is a
plumber and receives good wages when
he is sober enough to work.
"I was in the country," whined Go
gadus to the Judge, "and thought
child was being cared for by it? moth
er." \^
"I was visiting a lady friend of
mine," whined the woman, "and
thought the boy's father was looking
out for him."
â¢ â¢ â¢
"You were both drunk and apparent
ly careless of what became of your
child when the officer found you on
Harrison street last evening," said the
Judge. "I will continue this case till
to-morrow."
Lottie Gonzales, pretty of face and
picturesquely costumed, stood before
Judge Mogan and declared she was not
a vagrant. Her raven coiffure was
surmounted by a milliner's creation of
rakish shape and garish colors, a scar
let cape draped her shoulders and her
arms were akimbo and her head sauc
ily btrbbing as she addressed the bench.
"Well, did you ever?" she exclaimed
when Patrolman Reed had told of how
his investigation of her character had
led to the arrest.
"Did I ever what?" inquired his
Honor.
"Did you ever â why, mercy! Don't
you know what that means?"
The court's head wagged negatively.
"Mercy! Why it means that â that
I ain't that kind of a lady. Mercy! I
suppose if a lady doesn't tell all she
knows to every cop she meets she's
to be run in? Mercy! Did any one
ever?"
Senorita Gonzales was given till next
Monday to prove her accuser a falsi
fier and, with skirts aswish a la Car
men, she strode from the tribunal.
H. W. Meyers waxed wroth when
Judge Fritz sentenced him to three
months' imprisonment for assaulting
Mrs. Warner when that lady tried to
persuade her 16-year-old daughter,
Alice, to abandon him and return
home.
"Well, this is a nice thing!" ex
claimed Mr. Meyers. "Didn't I offer
to marry Allie, and what more could
I do?"
There was no response from th<*
bench and the prisoner fairly fumed
as he was led away by the bailiff.
A charge of vagrancy has been
filed against the girl and she is detain
ed in custody until the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children can
arrange for her proper care until she
attains woman's estate. Her parents
are divorced.
"I have been drunk four weeks,"
said Pat Coleman to Judge Mogan,
"and as I've had a good time I'm will
ing to be sent to jail."
"Money all gone, I suppose?" ven
tured the court-
"Every cent of it," replied Pat;
"but I've had a lively run for it and
have no kick comin*."
Mr. Coleman came down from the
mines to have his good time and says
that as soon as he is released from
prison he will resume drilling and
blasting until he has earned and
saved enough money to pay for an
other season of the metropolitan de
lights that lurk on the Barbary Coast.
He will be sentenced to-day for drunk
enness in a public place.
Danny Smith's mother declared that
his sister Mabel had no right to have
him arrested and charged wth dis
turbing, the peace because Dannie was
perfectly justified In resisting Mabel's
effort to exDel him from the maternal
roof at 96 Harrison street inasmuch
as Mabel was recently married and
has a home of her own, while Dannie
has no other abiding place than the
one he declined to leave. v
The defendant, a bright looking
lad, stated that ever since Mabel be
came a bride she has been afflicted
with an annoying h^bii of returning to
the home of her girlhood and "boss
ing" it. Just as she did for a long Mme
before she changed her name. . So
long as she had nobody else to "boss"
Dannie did not seriously object to be
ing nagged, but with a husband to
manage she might, Dannie opined, be
overworked by attempting to retain
her former domestic authority. This
consideration was partly responsible
for his revolt when she visited her
mother last Thursday evening and
with old time tyranny of tone and ac
tion bade him begone and never re
turn.
Judge Mogan confessed inability to
convict Dannie so long as his mother,
the real "boas" of the Smith house
hold, defended his resistance of Ma
bel's effort to evict.
David de Costa, barbed, elinkingly
confessed that he had systematically
swindled Mrs. Rosa Latimer, widow,
of 415% Natoma street, out of JS on
the 22d day of last February, and
Judee Mojan has the confession under
advisement.
Mrs. Latimer Â«stad a room to let
when De Costa, who resides with his
mother at North Beach, engaged it
and gave her in payment of %2 rental
a $10 Confederate greenback, accept
ing eight genuine dollars as change.

When dry it will neither shrink,

It contains no pitch nor resin and
when ignited is at once extinguished

The charm of billiards is not a fleet
ing one, as evidenced by the lasting
hold it has on its devotees. The ma
jority of the players attain their best
form after they have passed the. 40
year mark. The veteran among, the
players of this coast is William Ter
rill, known to his intimates as "Uncle
Billy." He blushingly acknowledges
his 71 years and has wielded a cue for
pastime for sixty years. He played in
his first tournament in 1860. ]
The fourteen-inch balk line tourna
ment now in progress at Morley's has
brought out some clever playing. . In
this tournament Messrs. Wright and
Sigourney are opposed to Dr. Burns,
James F. Morley, Frank du Bois and
Frank Coffin. The two class A men
play 300 to their opponents' 150.'
Mr. Sigourney was a competitor in
the national championship meeting at
New York two years ago. He tied for
first place and was then beaten In the
play-off. He played under marked
disadvantages during the trip, as he
was ill. He lost eighteen pounds in
weight, but was still able to play in
championship form.
, James F. Morley, who is interested
in the game both as a promoter and
a player, is endeavoring to - bring
Ferdinand Poggenberg-, the American
champion, to this city for a series of
games. Failing in getting him to come
West he will try to secure Wilson J?.
Foss, the Mayor of Haverstraw, N. Y.,
an ex-champion and one of the world's
greatest players. He is also endeavor
ing to match Spinks, the Californian
professional, with Fred Ames of Den
ver. . Â¦- ' â¢ Â¦
Three players, Wilson Sigourney,
"Chick" Wright and Al Mitchell, are
in class A and rank with any amateurs
in the world. Mr. Mitchell is never
seen in tournament play. To qualify
for this class a player must have made
a grand average of six in a tourna
ment. * Div O- B. Burns, the Olympic
Club champion, was just outside this
average in a tournament game during
the week and may attain the highest
honors in billiards at any time.
One may go through the entire cal
endar of sports and pastimes only to
find that Californians stand at the top
of the list whenever they enter the
competition. Billiards is no exception
to the rule, an unusual number of
Californians showing great skill in this
gentlemanly recreation for mind and
body.
"Chick" Wright and
Sigourney Are
Champions. .
This month will be a record breaker
in the number of tennis tournaments
to be played on the courts of this city.
Four events are scheduled, three of
which will be played on the California
and one on the park courts. The fact
that the park. tourney is divided into
classes and a Sunday is given to the
first and second and one to the third
and fourth classes wijl crowd the pub
lic courts for several weeks to come.
On the California Club courts the
more important events will be held.
Two are annual championships. The
first will be the Academic Athletic
League singles' and doubles. One will
be played on the 14th and the other
on the 21st Inst.
Ten schools will be represented and
the competition will be the most in
teresting ever held by the "prep"
schools. In the singles three players,
two from San Francisco schools and
one from a Berkeley school, are by
far the best and. one of them is sure
to win the championship. They are
Herbert Schmidt of Boone's. Herbert
Long of Lowell and Marius Hotchkiss
of Lick. The last named player won
the singles championship last year,
but can hardly hope to beat either
Lonsr or Schmidt. Cong is playing
the best game at present and | unless
he suffers his usual attack of "rat
tles" should win. Schmidt at his best
can probably beat Long, but he is so
seldom in the best of form that his
chances of winning are not better than
fair. '. . . '
In the doubles the Long brothers of
Lowell and Schmidt and Cunha of
Boone's probably stand the best
chance to win. The schools will be
represented as follows:
Woodland, Clarence I* Potter and Harold
Everhardt; Lowell, Herbert Long and Mel
ville Long: Alameda, Raymond Gott and Har
old Medcraft; Berkeley. Raymond Clinch and
Powell; Boone's, Clarence Cunha and Herbert
Schmidt; Lick. Mariua Hotchkiss and Naylor;
Hitchcock's, TaJlant and Barrett; Oakland
High, Lloyd Roberta and Curtlss Hayden; Pan
Jose High, S. McGraw and V. A. Partor; "Wil
merdlng, Harold Gabriel and Ed La garde.
The other championship tourna
ment is the first big event of the year.
It is the San Francisco championship
and is held annually on May 30 at
the California Club courts. Drum
mond MacGavin is the present cham
pion, and, outside of Percy Murdock.
who is in poor form, .is the only cham
pion player in the vicinity of San
Francisco.
There will be .a handicap, doubles
tournament for the directors' cup on
the California Club courts to-morrow.
The Wright & Ditson Official Guide
for 1904 is at hand and considerable
space is devoted to Pacific Coast ten
nis. Some player has had the temerity
to rank the ten leading players on the
coast. This is almost an impossibility
and a task that such experts as the
Hardys and Whitneys never could be
induced to undertake. The players
are too widely scattered and too few
tournaments are held to permit of a
ranking. The first five players are
fairly well ranked, but some of those
in the second five surely do not belong
there. Such men as Whitney, Collier,
Overton, Britton, Sinsabaugh, Wiehe.
Variel. Hart, Mitchell and other
prominent players are not given a
ranking. The players are ranked as
follows: 1â A. E. Bell; 2 â L. R. Free
man; 3 â Grant Smith; 4â Dmmmond
MacGavin; 5 â Percy Murdock; 6 â
Will Allen; 7 â Archie Way; 8 â George
Baker; 9 â Charles Dunlap; 10 â Clar
ence Griffin.
The question of the propriety of lady
golfers having their clubs carried at
championship or prize meetings by
professional or expert male friends has
often been discussed, both in the United
States and in Great Britain. In the
case of first-rate players the identity of
the caddie does not matter. Indeed, a
crack player would probably be dis
concerted and put oft his game by ad
vice, however sound and well meant.
In the case, however, of players of less
skill and knowledge, the friendly coun
sel of a crack player who knows the
game cannot fail to be valuable. A com
petitor helped in this way in an im
portant contest would certainly havo
an advantage over others who had to
depend on the ordinary caddie. Though
it seems inadvisable ,to interfere with
the freedom of selection of golfers, it
appears better that in competitions
where prizes or honors are at stake,
lidies should not be permitted to avail
themselves of the services of male rela
tives who are expert players, but should
be obliged to select from the caddiea
employed on the links where the tour

PHILADELPHIA BALL TEAMS
PROVE IN RARE FORM
Harry Stover annexed another purse
with Illowaho, "which, captured the
mile arid a sixteenth '' selling number
at odds of 6 and > 7 to ; 1. Golden Light,
the mount of Joe^ Jones, was Installed
favorite;, and, though "showing speed,
failed to get a mark. ' Fitzpatrick on
Merwan, a SO to 1 shot, made the run
ning for nearly a mile, with J. V.
Kirby fit his heels. .Then Crosswaite
came through with Illowaho, disposing
of Kirby by a couple of lengths.
In the concluding, mile and seventy
yard event" Ada N, with j Crosswaite up
instead of McBride^ who rode the; mare
on Wednesday, displayed marvelous
A world of money was bet on "Wilna,
from the stuble of Bianchi & McGovern,
to. win the opening five-furlong sprint,
for which a field of thirteen faced the
barrier. The mare broke first and dis
played plenty of speed, but lacked stay
ing qualities. At the paddock it seemed
the second choice, Lizzie Rice, would
win", whtn suddenly she began backing
up. Crosswalte, on Harry Stover's
Penzance, a 30 to :1 shot, slipped
through on the rail and, in a driving
finish, beat Partifag Jennie a head.
Edra, another outsider, ran third.
Jerry Roach had the leg up on Head
Dance, favorite for the two-year-old
scramble, and scored a win. The
Torso colt outstepped his company
from the start and at the wire won
cleverly from Velna and Marie J.
5 Torn . Rytn had Flyer in the six and
a half furlong selling event, and as
the gelding won, backed from threes to
11 to 5, the Chicago turfman must have
cleanefTup. My Surprise, the 6 to 5
choice, cui.out the running to the
stretch, where he began slacking up.
Jones then went to the front with
Flyer; leading outvthe favorite four
open lengths. Carilee, a 20 to. 1 shot,
ran into the show. â¢
ILLOWAHO A WINNER.
â¢ Miety's Pride, the Oregon whirlwind,
ridden by Joe Jones, possessed too
much speed for her field in the Futurity
course handicap yesterday at Oakland
track. Royal Rogue, the entry of James
Kealon, was the one selected to do the
trick and, at 8 to 5, received strong
support. Misty s Pride was not slow
in getting to the front and, while the
favorite closed some ground in the run
home, the Oregon mare defeated him
with apparent ease, covering the dis
tance in 1:09%. John A. Scott ran dis
appointingly, finishing third, in front
of Olympian.
Although Head Dance was the only
successful favorite, three heavily
backed second choices led their fields
out. Penzance, at 30 to 1, proved the
only rank outsider to earn brackets.
The attendance was again large.

NEW YORK. May 6.â The feature
event at Morris Park race track this
afternoon was the Larchmont Stakes
for 3-year-olds. It was won by the
Goughacre stable's Bryn M.'iwr, which
beat Gettysburg a head, after a soui
stlrring drive. It was a good d^y for
long shots, two at better than twenty
to one flashing first past the Judges.
The weather was balmy and the track
lightning fast.
"When the barrier was lifted in the
stake race Bryn Mawr was in a good
position. Fine Art essayed to cut out
the pace and led until the stretch wan
reached, where McCue took command
of affairs and pinning John Madden's
colt Gettysburg in on the rail, his
mount lasted just long enough to win.
Thompson was not able to arouse the
sluggish Gettysburg sufficiently to en
able him to win. The colt met with
repeated interference, but closed reso
lutely at the end. Just aa the 'winning
post was passed he had his head In
the air, while that of Bryn Mawr was
down. It was the margin of a noaÂ»'
by which the latter won. Summary:
First race, five and a half furlongs â Up
masked won, Louise Elston second. Mexnphian
third. Time, 1:OSVÂ«.
Second race. Eclipse- course â Toupee won,
Champlain second. Girdle third. Time. 1:12.
Third rac!Â». Larchmont stakes, seven fur

Buckleya third. Time. 1:28.
Fourth race, half a milt â Glorifler won. Sal
vage second. Thirty third, lime. :47*4.
Fifth race, seven furlongs â Runnells won,
Hippocrates second. Illjxla third. Time.
1 :2ti 3-5.
Sixth race. Withers mile â Honolulu won, Ella
Snyder second. Stonewall th trd. Time, 1:40%.
Gray kept getting into bad holes all
through the game! and got, out' of five
of them without much damage being
done toÂ»his curves; But the sixth was
the limit. Jt proved the real fatality.
When the home players started to get
runs they kept right on and broke the
game up as it should have been broken.
The Angels were without Bernard
and Ross, but this did not hamper them
to any great extent, as 'Wheeler, who
played the right garden, slammed the
ball safely four times out of four at
tempts and figured in the scoring' of
two runs. Cravath ;did some great
throwing from left field and cut off a
couple of runs in!this manner. The

Up. to the eighth the Angels had a
lead of a run and it looked good for
them. Irwin, the first man up for
Uncle, went out. easily. Gorton was
passed by Gray, while Massey hit a
soft one to Flood that should have
been a double play.. ..Instead,. Tim
floundered around the lot f or_ a minute
or so and both men were safe.
"Dolly" Gray ascended long enough
to walk Anderson "and fill 'em all up.
There were shouts and shouts of glad
ness when VRabbit" Miller rubbed
some earth into his mits and, still more
when he whirred the ball out to left
field and brought in Gorton and Mas
sey. Knell fanned, but- then "Dolly"
made a wild .pitch which let Anderson
arrive. Hildebrand bit off a two sackgr
and in came the "Rabbit."- Waldron
also banged it safely, but Hilde was
nailed at the plate. . %
"Rabbit" Miller has become one of
the -greatest men- south- of the slot
within the last few days. The fans
expect him to turn all kinds of tricks
and many times he is right there.: He
was there with a hit yesterday after
noon at Recreation Park in the eighth

LONDON, May 6. â The annual
demonstration of the Primrose League
attracted an enormous gathering at
Albert Hall to-day, being the centen
ary year of the birth of the late Lord
Beaconsfleld. The decorations were
more elaborate than usual.
Premier- Balfour's address was not
of much interest Internationally. He
took a roseate view of Great Britain's
foreign relations. The foreign affairs
of this country were, he declared. In
a happy and prosperous condition.
Balfour attached enormous value to
the Anglo-French agreement, because
he believed it was going to prove a
permanent arrangement.
Foreign Secretary Lansdowne and
Foreign Minister Delcasse had done
work which was not only beneficial to
their respective countries, but to the
whole world. Balfour referred to the
Far Kast as the "despair of European
statesmen," and pointed out that the
Government did not purpose to play
into the hands of revolutionists, "who
would rather see genuine reform fail
than succeed if it did not cover all
their demands."
The Premier closed with lecturing
the opposition on their attitude, to
ward the colonies, especially in regard
to Chinese labor, and declaring
that nothing but the unity of the
Unionist party would finally lay the
specter of home rule or protect great
imperial Interests from the injury with
which they were threatened.
Statesman Attaches Much
Importance to England's
Agreement With France
In estimating the value of tin ores In this
northern region several facts should be borne
In- mind.'- The region is utterly without tim
ber and Is accessible; by ocean steamers anty
from June to the end of October at the longest.
Harbor facilities are poor, and all supplies
and wages 'are high. On the other hand tbe
construction v of . railroads and wagon roads is
not difficult and will require comparatively
small outlay. All of the occurrences described
are within a- few. miles of tidewater.- Freight
rates to Puget Sound. ports should be very. low.
ax the large fleet of ocean steamers whlcti
run to Nome return empty. Last summe â¢
upward of 98,000 tons of freight were brought
to Alaska by vessels that called at Nome.
It Is fair to say that these tin deposits are
well worth careful and systematic prospecting.
- The facts show cassiterite to be rather
Irregularly distributed - through an area I of
about 450 square miles, embracing the western
end of Seward Peninsula. At three localities â
Anikovik River, Buhner Creek and Buck Creel*
â Its occurrence Vln placers has been verified
by the Geological Survey, and lode tin has
been found by the survey at Lost River and
at Cape Mountain. There are a number of
other places wh^ere prospectors report Its oc
currence In lode* or placer : form. Â¦
; The tin ore la almost all cassiterite, though
a little stanntte has been found at one- locality.
Its original- source Is In deposits of at -least
two essentially different types. In the one
It Is In quarts veins, which cut phy lines or
metamorphlc slates; in the other the cassiterite
is disseminated, through more or less altered
granitic rocks. This second type of lode de
posit-Is the one which gives promise of com
mercial importance.
Prospectors have reported the discov
ery of small amounts of stream tin in
a great many streams In the York re
gion, among them' being the Baituk and
Kigezruk creeks, flowing into Bering
Sea; Banner Creek, a tributary of the
Anikovik River; several , small creeks
flowing into Lopp Lagoon; Clara Creek,
a tributary of Mint River, andjYork
Creek, a tributary of Pinguk River.
Stream tin has been reported from
all parts of the Seward peninsula,
where gold mining is In progress, but
the Geological Survey says that except
in respect to the York region these re
ports have generally been found to be
without foundation. Tin ores in in
considerable amounts have been dis
covered by the Geological Survey to ex
ist at Brooks Mountain, near the head
of Lost River and four miles north of
the Lost River tin deposits; the hills
east of Don River; Ears Mountain,
about fifty miles north of Port Clar
ence: Asses Ears, about twenty miles
south of Kotzebue Sound, and the Dio
mede Islands, In Bering Strait, about
thirty miles west of Cape Prince of
Wales.
-The conclusions reached by the Geo
logical Survey from a review of the
discoveries of tin are of interest. They
are given in full as follows:
Buck Creek is the scene of the first
attempt at tin mining on a practical
scale in Alaska, so reports the geo
logical survey. It Is the present cen
ter of the tin placer mining activities.
The settlement is on the Arctic slope
of the Seward Peninsula, about twen
ty miles northeast of York and four
miles from tidewater on Lopp Lagoon,
an inlet from the Arctic Ocean. \ It is
reached by wagon road from York
that follows the bed of Anikovik Riv
er for ten miles, then crosses a low di
vide to Grouse Creek; then follows
down the bed of Grouse Creek to its
junction with Buck Creek. -Lopp La
goon is not navigable for deep-sea go-
Ing vessels and will not, probably, be
used as a means of transportation of
ore from the Buck Creek diggings.
The evidence regarding < the Buck
Creek region can be summed up
briefly.
. Tin ore has been found In Buck
Creek from its mouth to within a mile
of Its head. The creek is a small stream
about five miles in length. The pay
streak is confined to the present stream
bed and flood plain deposits, and prob
ably varies from ten to twelve feet to
150 feet in width. In the present creek
the* ore is found from the surface down.
Outside the creek bed there 1 is a cov
ering of moss and muck above the
gravel. No ore Is known to have been
found on the hillsides surrounding
Buck Creek or on the plateau surface
in which Buck Creek is incised. The
thickness of the tin-bearing gravel va
ries from a few Inches to /four or five
feet. Estimates of the tin ore In the
gravel vary from eight to twenty-seven
pounds per cubic yard. Probably the
former amount is more nearly the
average of the creek.
Tin v ore %vas discovered on Buck
Creek in the fall of 1901, and some min
ing for stream tin was performed in
the summer of 1902. As a result of this
work several tons of ore were shipped
out to the States. During the summer
of 1903 several companies were exploit
ing claims on the creek. The methods
of mining and sluicing stream tin were
all modifications of somewhat primitive
methods of gold placer mining. It is
reported that considerable ore was ob
tained and hauled to York for ship
ment.
The first discoveries of tin ore in the
York region were made on the Anikovik
River and Buhner Creek. Anikovik
River enters Bering^ Sea at the town
of York. It is about~flfteen miles long.
It flows in a comparatively broad val
ley cut in the York plateau. In the
lower part of the Anikovik Valley there
are rather extensive gravel deposits.
The bedrock consists for the most part
of slates, that break up into pencil
shaped fragments. Since 1901 the work
ings on Anikovik' River and on Buhner
Creek are reported to have been aban
doned. Specimens of cassiterite were
discovered in the sluice boxes while
sluicing for gold was In progress. The
Geological Survey reports that there are
extensive gravel deposits on Anikovik
River that might be made to yield fair
returns, either in gold or In tin, If
economically worked on an extensive
scale by the hydraulic process. Suf
ficient water for this purpose is to be
obtained from the head .of Anikovik
River or from Kaiiaguk River.
GENERAL- CONCLUSIONS.
ACTUAL MIXING OF TIX.
on the surface of the mountain. Mr.
Colliep reports that much of the sup
posed tin ore contains a great many
dark minerals that have been mistak
en for cassiterite, but are simply tour
maline in slender black and brown
needles. ,
Cape Mountain is composed almost
entirely of granite in the form of boss
or stock intruded in /the limestone/
The granite cuts across the stratifica
tion of the limestone. Specimens of
tin ore were secured by the geological
survey from the granite of the moun
tain, . but the ore was not definitely
traced to its position in -the bedrock.
It is reported that tin ore has been
found in at least three 'distinct points
in this mountain and'that it, occurs in
somewhat irregular deposits that have
an eastward trend. Several tunnel3
have been driven Into the mountain.
It. was 'not learned that ore bodies
were found in any of the tunnels. The
report does not contain 1; any definite
estimate concerning the probable val
ues of the Cape Mountain tin ores.
They differ ' In general- appearance
from that seen on Lost River. Large
pieces of nearly" pure cassiterite, one
of which weighed about nine pounds,
are. reported" to have been discovered
The tin ore in this deposit is. in
part at least, an altered granite-por
phyry or "greisen," having crystals of
cassiterite disseminated through it.
The greisen forms a dike that has
been followed eastward from Cassiter
ite Creek to Tin Creek, a distance of
about 6000 feet. Specimens contain
ing cassiterite have been picked up at
both ends of the dike.' The tin ore
discovered on Tin Creek was about
?half a mile south of the main lode.
Stanniteor tin pyrites was discovered
in mineralized granite, together with
other metallic sulphides. The ore is
probablv of little value except as in
dicating a wider distribution of tin
through the granites. Tin has also
; been discovered in the bowlders in Tin
Creek, but not in large quantity.
The Cape Mountain tin deposits oc
cur in a high peak that marks the
: most western point in America. A
j settlement called Tin City has grown
up within a year oh the. southeastern
side, while on the northwest side, fac
ing toward. Bering Strait, the old Es
kimo village of Kingegan is situated.
East Cape and other points on the Si
berian coast are plainly visible on a
clear day from the summit of this
mountain. On the west and south
sides the mountain slopes down to
bluffs that drop almost perpendicu
larly into the sea. On the southeast
side, where Tin City is situated, there
is a small bight in the coast line that
affords some protection from west
winds, but for the prevailing south
winds of summer the . harbor is prac
tically an open roadstead and affords
little, if any, better landing facilities
than are found at Nome or York. Tin
City is forty miles distant and north
west of good anchorage on Port Clar
ence.
LONG DIKE OP GREISEX^.
Lode tin deposits were discovered be
tween four and five miles from the
coast on Lost River, which enters
Bering Sea ten miles west of Point
Clarence. Lost River is about ten
miles long. It drains the central part
of the York Mountains. Its two tribu
taries^Tin Creek and Cassiterite Creek,
enter from the east about three and
four miles, respectively, from its
mouth. Tin ore has been found on
both of these creeks. Between Tin
Creek and Lost River there Is a white
porphyrltlc dike, cutting the limestone
four or five mHes from the coast. This
forms the present focal point of inter
est to the tin miner. This dike, which
has been traced from Tin Creek on the
east to Cassiterite Creek on the west,
a distance of about a mile, is about
100 feet wide. Tin ore has been found
on the croppings of this dike and
strewn over its surface along its course,
varying in general appearance and
character. The value of the lode must
be left an open question until excava
tions have been made sufficient for
systematic sampling.
Since then, according to the Geologi
cal Survey, tin ore has been found both
in lodes and in alluvial deposits in a
number of widely separated localities.
In 1903 Mr. Colliep and Frank L. Hess
visited, for the Geological Survey, the
Lost River. Buck Creek and Cape
Mountain , localities, the two extreme
points being twenty-five miles, apart.
These are the places, so it is reported,
that gave the most promise of the pro
duction of tin.
After the discovery of gold at Nome,
prospectors in 1898 rapidly extended
their search to all parts of Seward Pen
insula arid, as early as the fall of 1899,
found placer gold in the Anikovik
River. In 1900 Alfred H. Brooks of the
United States Geological Survey vis
ited the JTork region and found, in the
placers of Anikovik River and Buhner
Creek, one of its tributaries, some
specimens cf stream tin. The general
interest in the tin deposits of the York
region. dates from that time.
"Tin," so says the Geological Sur
vey, "has~ been reported from several
localities in the United States, but has
never proved to be present in com
mercial quantities, A lew years ago,
however, stream tin was discovered by
a survey party in Alaska. This discov
ery attracted much attention. During
the season of 1903 a discovery of lode
tin was made in Alaska."
At the outset it is declared by
the Geological Survey that the
known occurrences of tin are in
what is called the iork region of
the Seward peninsula. This region
derives its name from Cape York, an
ill denned promontory on the Bering
Sea, about ninety miles north
west of Nome. It extends northwest
ward from this cape and Includes Cape
Prince of \ Wales, the most western
point of the continent. The region has
the general form of an isosceles tri
angle, with its apex at Cape Prince ot
Wales and its two sides formed by the
shores of the Arctic Ocean and the
Bering Sea.
THE EARLIEST DISCOVERY.
That tin exists in Alaska has long
been known. It has remained for the
United States Geological Survey to em
body in a pamphlet having Govern
mental sanction the available testi
mony relative to the extent of a coun
try that is enriched by tin. Arthur J.
Colliep is the author of a paper which
is indorsed by publication through Gov
ernmental sources.

General Merchandise.
The weakness In Butter Is more pronounced
and quotations are slightly lower. Stocks are
too heavy and there Is a general pressure to
sell, which buyers are taking advantage of.
There is no chance in Che*se.
â¢Eggs have turned very weak during the past
twenty-four hours, and. though some of the
outside houses, such as the fruit and poultry
firms, are still getting 22 %c for ranch, the
large handlers, almost without exception, are
offering their very best brands for, less money.
Close buyers found little difficulty In fllllrfg
their wants yesterday at 21Â©21%c. The com
mission houses, even those which have hitherto
been persistent bulls on the market, have all
turned sellers and arÂ» making concessions to
work off their stocks. A line of 200 cases
from. Santa Rosa, which has been on the wharf
trying to find a buyer for several days, was
offered all around, but could, not be sold. The
situation is being further weakened by liberal
offerings of Eastern at 18*J19c and by the filling
of all the northern orders which have lately
helped the market. There are now no outside
orders for anywhere on the market, and the
local demand will have to absorb the heavy
stocks If it can.

SUMMARY OF THE MARKETS.
CHICAGO. May 6.â The Ohio crop report was
perhaps the chief factor in causing a strong
wheat' market to-day. At the close the price
of July wheat showed a gain of T4@lc. Corn
Is down %6%c Oats are oft Vfcig'Vic. Provi
sions closed 5c to 22%c lower.
The opening In wheat was firm under the In
fluence of small receipts and higher prices at
Liverpool. July at 85^@85%c. Immediately af
ter the opening there was a short period of
hesitation in the minds of many traders, dur
ing which time the market assumed an easier
turn. July celling off to 85%c. The Â«llghtly
bearish sentiment soon ' gave way, howeVer, to
a preponderance of bullish crop advices, the
first one of which was the Ohio. crop report.
Statistics in regard to the condition of winter
wheat In that State showed marked deteriora
tion, the figures being 53, compared with C7
last month. Shorts and commission houses be
came active buyers and-the market soon devel
oped decided strength. Some impetus was
given the upward' trend by the strength of the
Northwestern market, notwithstanding the shut
down of the flour mills at Minneapolis. A gen
eral report on the condition of the winter crop,
iwsufd by, a well known Chicago authority, was
decidedly bullish. According to this expert, a
heavy falling off 'in winter wheat conditions
was manifested in all States east of the Missis
sippi River and north of the Ohio. Some States
were said to show a decline of 10 to. 15 point*.
The loss In the Ohio Valley. It was claimed,
was the heaviest in many years.. A partial con
firmation of this figure was given In a report
from St. Louis by . another crop statistician.
Under this superabundance of adverse news the
market continued to gain in strength until late
in the session. During the last half hour real
izing sales checked the advancing tendency, and
the market reacted slightly In price.' but the
close waÂ» FtronK. After selling up to 8C%c July
closed at 8Â«HÂ©S(J%c.
During the early part of the session . shorts
were active purchasers of corn, and In conse
quence the market ruled strong. The market
closed near the low point. - July opened a shade
to We lower at 48%c to 48|Â«i@48%c, sold be
tween 48W@-* fi^Â»c and 48%c and closed at 48%c.
In sympathy with other grains oats were
strong early In the day. After opening %@$ic
higher at 3Â»V6c, July ranged between 38%c and
31) Uc and closed at 38% c. Â¦
lieavy celling by packers and outside Interr
estfl caused weakness in provisions. The mar
ket was firm early in sympathy with higher
prices for hogs at the yards and on the strong
grain markets, but sentiment soon changed, the
market becoming weak on poor support. At the
close July pork was down 22%c. â¢ July lard was
7V4c lower and July ribe were off 5@7'iC

The bulk of the fruit shipments orig
inate in Northern California at points
along the Southern Pacific, and efforts
to change the routeing of these ship
ments from over the mountain road to
that of the Santa Fe, even had the lat
ter carried out its plan to invade the
Sacramento Valley, would be regarded
as improbable. Instead of a third of
the business, which i^ has been getting
in the past. local railroad men, believe
that the Santa Fe's future share of
shipments will, if the Southern Pacific
maintains its new position, be less than
750 cars from this State. A chance to
retaliate in the citrus fruit shipping
business in Southern California Is
hardly within reach of the Santa Fe,
for the reason that the territory is
about equally divided between the two,
which are now dividing the traffic.
Before further business can be con
tracted for by Eastern road repre
sentatives here the Transcontinental
Freight Bureau will have to pass upon
the action of the Southern Pacific and
fix a new rate.
ern Pacific, and it is expected that the
Santa Fe will make, a hard fight to
capture this business, although many
railroad men theorize that the shippers
will object to taking a chance with
their fruit over the long southern
route in the hot season of the year.

. A trip was made through the exten
sive plant. Everybody ate prunes,
cooked ones were on the table for lunch,
dried ones were stacked to the ceiling
in bins. Each of the guests was
handed a sample package. Points of
interest were visited throughout the
city and later through Stanford Uni
versity at Palo Alto. v.
As the visitors entered the^ waiting
train to return to San Francisco good
bys were said to the San Jose commit
tee, and from now on every delegate
to the seventh annual convention of the
National Retail Grocers* Association
who was on the excursion yesterday
will be a walking advertisement for
California and Santa Clara Valley
fruits.
- F. W. Crandall, manager . of the
Sorosis Fruit Company, said he
was glad of the opportunity to talk to
the men who have the handling of the
Santa Clara Valley fruits in their
hands in the East, as he desired to call
their attention to the fact that at
present they are charging prices which
give them from B0 to 100 per cent profit,
and that fact retarded the demand for
the goods. He appealed to the grocers
to push the fruits from that section
of the State and to take a hint from
what he had Just told them about
A. W. Farlinger, the new president
of the association, responded In the
name of the association.
I Los Gatos was reached about noon,
and the guests were given ample time
to take in the sights of that pretty
town. Returning to Sorosis the guests
were directed to the building of the
company known as "social hall," where
a bountiful lunch was served.
Speeches were made by C. H. Teb
betts of Chicago. W. P. Lyons of San
Jose, A. W. Farlinger of Atlanta (Ga.),
A. J. Ross of San Jose and C. R. Lott
of Chicago. In behalf of the Chamber
of Commerce, Mr. Lyons welcomed the
association.
D^elegates to the National Retail
Grocers' Association are full of prunes.
They are also full of facts regarding
California, which they will use in their
conversations for years to come. Many
of them have started fot their Eastern
homes and the others will leave to-day.
Yesterday was spent in the vicinity of
San Jose, and it was there they got
the prune habit and facts and figures
to astonish their neighbors when they
go home.
A committee of fifty, composed of
members of the San Jose Chamber of
Commerce and the . Grange, was on
hand to extend the hospitality of the
county to the visitors. Interurban cars
were in waiting, and the start was
made for Los Gatos. Many of the dele
gates had taken the regular train in the
morning and were also on hand to join
In the trip, there being more than 200

Of the entire deciduous fruit district
in. this State the only portions tribu

tfel&re Traffic Director Stubbs, with no
doubt the approval of E. H. Harriman,
'has thrown a serious obstacle in his
way by declaring off the existing Joint
rate which has governed the cost of
shipments of fruit over portions of the
Southern Pacific to transfer points of
the Santa. Fe.
It v.as declared yesterday that the
Santa Fe would accept the notice as a
challenge for a fight and would proceed
to give its rival a fierce one, but among
railroad men it is generally conceded
that the Southern Pacific has its com
petitor at its mercy and that the trou
ble will end by the Santa Fe abandon-
Ing its Sacramento River- Antioch pro
ject.
SANTA FE IN A BAD WAY.
The annual shipment of deciduous
fr-uits from California is about 7500
cars, of which the Santa Fe has been
getting about one-third, handled by
way of Pueblo over the Southern Pa
cific and the Denver and Rio Grande.
Recently the Santa Fe conceived the
pJan of establishing a steamer service
along the Sacramento River, connect
ing with Antioch, and thereby bid for
a greater proportion of the fruit ship
ment business.
' Yesterday the representatives of the
various Western lines in this city re
ceived from Robert H. Countlss, local
agent of the Trancontinental Freight
Bureau, a formal notice to the effect
lha^ the Southern Pacific Company
would henceforth refuse to join with
the" Santa Fe in the prevailing through
rate on deciduous fruits, and the agen
cies of Eastern roads were instructed
to cancel all contracts for shipments
made under the abolished rate.
The announcement caused consider
able comment and was accepted in the
light at a direct slap at the Santa Fe
for its recent temerity in planning to
invade that portion of Northern Cali
fornia tributary to the Southern Pacific
liftes in search of fruit shipments.
FIGHT MAY ENSUE.
Following closely on the announce
ment that the Southern Pacific and
the' Santa Fe roads have entered into
an alliance in so far as their Northern
California coast counties interests are
concerned comes the news that the
traffic director of the Harriman line is
prepared to freeze the Santa Fe Com
pany out of a share In the deciduous
fruit traffic in California.
The announcement was made at the
meeting yesterday that A. B. Spreckels,
president of the commission, would
leave the city for Europe next Mon
day. Commissioner Altman is prepar
ing to take a vacation in June.
The subject of a site for the monu
ment in honor of the volunteers in' the
Spanish war was incidentally discussed
yesterday. Ex- Mayor Phelan recom
mended that the monument be placed

At the meeting of the Park Commis
sion yesterday afternoon at the office
of Reuben H. Lloyd, representatives of
assc-ciations interested in the proposed
new athletic grounds and speed track
in Golden Gate Park were clearly ad
vised that work of construction could
not begin until the outside contribu
tion of $25,000 was available. Commis
sioner Lloyd, who presided in the ab
sence of President A. B. Spreckels,
stated distinctly that $25,000 of public
money had been set aside for the en
terprise and that work would begin &s
soon as an equal amount was placed

work, when once begun, would be push
ed to speedy conclusion. Commissionern

in the sentiments expresed by the pre
siding officer. I. L. Borden, F. J.
O'Kane, A. W. Morganstern and oth
ers of interested delegations will pro
ceed with renewed vigor to raise the
money. Mr. Borden announced that
the horsemen had $10,000 In bank. He
desired that the work should begin
on the assurance that the remaining
$15,000 be raised, but the commission
declined firmly but courteously to en
tertain that proposition.

Before Judge Cook dismissed the
Jury he warned, them" that .nothing
which had, been said by Assistant Dis
trict Attorney -Ashe was to beconsid
erd;in the light of evidence, and that
the jurymen were expected to Judge
the facts solely from the evidence of
the witnesses and riot from the state
ments of counsel^on either side.
When the afternoon session convened
General 'Salomon announced that, in
view of the court's instructions to the
Jury, h? had determined to await un
til the opening of the defense to make
his preliminary remarks to the jury.
The prosecution then proceeded to in
tr6duce*teÂ«timony.
. ; JURJl' WILL VIEW SCENE.
Corporal <George W. Russell of the
Police Department, who made a topo
graphical chart of the neighborhood
where the body of Blaise was found on
the .morning of .January 11, was the
first .witness. He testified that the ob-,
servations upon which the map ; was
based were made on January. 13.. At
that time he found a pool of blood.be
low a retaining wall on Russian Hill
in the Taylor-street cut, and explained
fully the relative distances from vari
ous points of location, the height of
the hill and - other data tending to
prove the place of crime. His observa
tions will be more fully gone Into- after
the jury has visited the neighborhood
where the body, of Blaise was found.
James W. Fowler, employed , as so
licitor for the Pacific Mutual Insurance
Company, was the next witness. He
! testified that on the evening of Decem
ber 23 he visited the room at 827 Jack
son street, occupied '. by. Soeder and
Blaise in response to a letter signed by
Soeder and given to the solicitor, by
the manager of the company.' Soedfer
was not at home at that time, and
Blaise could riot talk English.
Accordingly Fowler returned the
following evening, arid, was met by
Soeder outside the entrance toj-the
house. The- two entered together and
found Blaise there. After some dis
cussion an application ' for an accident
policy for $3000 was written in Blaise's
favor, the beneficiary being his wife.
Then Fowler. urged Soeder to take out
a similar Â¦ policy ' for himself and â¢ the
; latter, finally agreed, suggesting at the
; same time that Blaise's \ policy should
be changed so as to make Soeder. the
beneflciar'y and Soeder's ' policy should
name Blaise as the beneficiary. The
applications .were filled. out according
ly, and at Soeder's request; the policies
were mailed to ' him ; the day â¢ following.

General Salomon, chief counsel for
the defendant, stated to the court that
he desired to enter a general objec
tion to the opening statement of the
prosecution, as portions of it had dwelt
on matters that could not possibly be
accepted as legal evidence in the
charge. Judge Cook overruled the ob
jection on the ground that it should
have b<;en made specifically at the
time the alleged violations were made.
General Salomon then announced that
he desired to make his opening state
ment to the Jury before the prosecution
started to introduce testimony. This
ended' the morning session. -
The' Assistant District Attorney was
particularly insistent on the contention
of the prosecution that Blaise^had -no
money of his own, and therefore could
not have been killed for motives of rob
bery. He also promised to prove that
Soeder was absolutely without money
until he had obtained $130 on the watch
and ring which he had claimed to have
been robbed of while on his way East,
and on which pretext he secured $100
from Miss Flatley by telegraph just
before he sailed for Europe.
At the conclusion of the opening
statement Judge Cook suggested that,
as it would be necessary for the jury
to visit the scene of the crime,, it
would be proper on the part of the
prosecution to introduce only, such wit
nesses as could testify to matters pre
liminary to such inspection. District
Attorney Byington asked the in
dulgence of the court; on .' behalf of
James W. Fowler, a solicitor for the
Pacific Mutual Insurance Company,
who was compelled to leave the city
to be at the deathbed of his mother,
and the court*, readily granted, the re
quest.
OBJECTS TO STATEMENTS.
He reviewed in full the circumstances
of Soeder's trip to Germany, his alleged
decoying of Blaise from his home and
the attempt to secure large amounts
of insurance on the latter's life by
Soeder. â¢ As a motive he described the
defendant's infatuation for Miss Cath
erine Flatley, who is one of the strong
est witnesses against Soeder and whom
he had promised to marry as soon as
he had acquired an alleged estate in
Germany, which he said had been left

AH the testimony introduced yester
day in the trial of Leon Soeder for the
muKler of his brother-in-law, Joseph
Blaise, on the night of January 10,
when the latter's throat was cut, con
sisted of two witnesses who have been
on the stand in the preliminary'exam
ination. The first of these was Cor
poral George W. Russell, official topog
rapher of the Police Department, and
James W. Fowler, a solicitor for the
Pacific Mutual Insurance \ Company.
Their testimony was about the same
as they gave at the preliminary hear
ing.
The panel was completed at 11 o'clock
yesterday morning by the acceptance
by both sides of J. C. Pascoe.'who is a
manufacturer of chronometers and
nautical instruments at 305 Battery
street and who resides at 305 Steiner
street. It was fortunate from a point
of expedition that he proved accept
able, as he was the last remaining
talesman out of a list of forty sum
moned, and another venire would have
been forced by his dismissal.
R. Porter Ashe, who is assisting Dis
trict Â¦ Attorney Byington, made the #
opening statement. He spent exactly
an hour in addressing the jury and did
full Justice to himself and his cause.
Briefly reviewing So'eder's birth and
previous manner of life, he plunged
into the chain /of â; circumstantial evi
dence that has been forged around the
defendant in connection with the mur
der of Joseph Blaise, his * brother-in
law. / Â¦/'.'. -J .
Judge Cook announced, when the
witness had concluded, that an ad
journment would be taken until Mon
day afternoon at 2, o'clock, when the
jury and himself would view the
premises surrounding the place where
the body was found. As he expected
this would consume most of the after
noon he excused all other -witnesses in
the case until Tuesday morning at 10
o'clock. '. . \
As far as intimated in the opening
statement by Assistant District Attor
ney Porter Ashe there has been no new
evidence developed for the prosecu
tion since the preliminary hearing of
the defendant. In police circles, how
ever, it is steadily rumored that de
velopments are at hand that will posi
tively connect Soeder with, the murder
of his brother-in-law. It is claimed
that during the eight hours' freedom
Soeder enjoyed between the discovery
of Blaise's body and his final arrest he
made efforts to secure an alibi and in
one of. these attempts he practically
admitted his connection with the mur
der. Detective Tom Gibson and other
officials connected with the case will
neither deny nor confirm these rumors,
but they are so persistently circulated
as to give belief Ahat at least one new
and important witness has been se
cured. .
At this visit some conversation was
indulged in "between the witness and
Soeder regarding an endowment policy
for $10,000 on Blaise's life. Fowler
told Soeder that he could not write that,
as his duties were confined to accident
and health policies. He promised to
notify his company of Soeder's desires
and on the following evening called
at Soeder's room with W. Osbourne, a
solicitor in the life insurance depart
ment of the company. Soeder -made
a request for a $10,0 00 'straight life pol
icy for Blaise and the application was
made out; Osbourne asked for a deposit
and Soeder gave him $50 to bind the
contract in case the risk should be
assumed by the comr/any.
On the following evening Fowler,
Osbourne and Dr. Mizner, medical
examiner of the company, called on
Soeder and Blaise. Osbourne told
Soeder that the company refused tWe
$10,000 risk, but was willing to grant
one for $3000. Soeder appeared much
put out at this news, but finally ac
cepted the $3000 policy, and between
him and Blaise the' balance of the
money, was paid In cash.
At this time Osbourne told him that
he might be able to get the additional
insurance from some other company
and promised to try to secure it. He
made an engagement with Soeder, but
Fowler could not state for what time
or , what place the engagement was
made, as he had not paid much atten
tion to the conversation. The cross
examination did not affect the wit
ness' testimony in any particular.
JURY WILL VIEW SCENE.
WANTS LIFE INSURANCE.
The policies ran until January 16 and
Soeder paid $10 to Fowler as premium.
