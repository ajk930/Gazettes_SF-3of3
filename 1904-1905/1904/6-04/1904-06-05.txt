- It was the skipper's voice, ringing in
the white night beyond. . There was. an
answering trample, like the sound of
T "Iss, Saul. Oh, make haste!"
,-' In a -moment. they were under the
forward quarter, standing firm on a
narrow pan , of -ice, waiting .for the
drift of the schooner to bring the rail

Saul caught up the lad and lifted him
high. But she was' dragging the men

'"Show, a bit o' that Jib!" Â¦-Â¦'Â¦'.â¢
The words were now blurred by **J e

creak and rattle of the sail running up
the stays, but heard nothing.
"Sau-au-1-1!" , ; ' â
The long cry csme as from far ofT,
beating its way against the wind,
i muffled by the snow between.
That' was the last.
Now, the man was stripped to his
â¢strengthâ to his naked strength:, to .his
present -store of -vigor and heat and
nutriment, plenteous or depleted, as
might bâ¬. He was. stripped of rudder
and sail.: If was a barehanded fight
strength to strength. "Escape was by
endurance_-by enduring the' wind and
' the waves and the cold until such time
as the 'sea's passion wasted Itself and
she fell into that rippling, sunny mood
in which she gathers strength for new
assault. Even now-+t was as though the
fragments â¢ of ice over s which he was
aimlessly leaping tried to elude hlm-r
to throw him otf. So he cast about for
. better positionâ for place on some pan
which would be like a wall to the back
of an* outnumbered man. After a time
ho found a pan, to which three men had
already fled. He had to swim part way;
but they helped him up, for the pan
was thirty feet square, and there was
room for him."
; "Be It you, Samuel?" said Saul.
"Iss, 'tis Iâ an 1 Matthew Weather and
Andrew Butfs." -V , ; ' Â¦
Saul. took his jacket to wring it out.
"Were it you, -Matthew, b'y," he said,
making ready to put it on again, "were
It you jumped onme backâ out there?"
"Sure, an'I doan't know, Saul. Maybe t
'twere... I forgets. 'Twere terribleâ out 1

They sat down â huddled In the mid
dle of the pan; the snow. eddied -over
and about them . and left drifts behind.
Soon the pack vanished over the short
circumference of the' sight" Then small
waves began Â¦ to 'break j over, the pan to
windward. ' The water.- rolled -to Saul's
shoes.and lapped, them.; . \

and he had a doctor from Tilt Cove for
the last baby. Maybe the cold was to
blcme for that forgetfulness.
'Â¦Â¦ "You leaves moare'n me. Matthew,"
said Saul. "I leaves oan'y one."
â¢'The snow cloud darkened. Night had
crept near.- The shadow overhung the
pan. More, the wind had a sweep over
open water, for the pack was now
widely distributed. Larger waves ran
at the pan, momentarily Increasing in
number and height. One swept itâ a
thin sheet of water, curling from end
to end. Then another; then three in
quick succession, each rising higher.
"Issâ a laps, ben't she?" said Matthey,
taking up the talk again.
"A girl. Matthew," said Saul. "A
girl," he repeated, after a moment's
silence, "just a wee bit of a girl. 'Tla
like John'll look after she."
"Oh, 'sure, b'y â sure! 'Tis like John
will."
"That lass!" said Saul. "Does you
think he'll give she music lessonsâ that
wee thing?"
"Iss, sure! An" she'll'play the organ
in the church t" Hagged Harbor â when
they gets one. She'll', be growed up
then." '. â¢ '
"Iss, maybe," said Saul.
There was a long time in which no
word was spoken. A wave broke near
and rose to the waists of the men. No
one stirred. .* ..'
"Does they Tarn you about â about â
how t' goa about eatln' t' Saint
John's?" said Saul. "All aboutâ knives
âan' forks?" , , . . V
"Eh, b'y?" said Matthew, spurring
himself to attend.
"I always thought I'd like she t" know
about they things â when she grows up,"
said Saul. . .
Soon he stood up, for the waves
were rl si ngr higher. In the words of
the Newfoundlander, he . stood up to
face the,Beas. The others had so far
succumbed to cold and despair that
they sat where they were, though the
waves, which' continuously ran over
tho pan, . rose, from time to time, to
their waists. It Â¦ was night; the man's
world was then no more than a frozen
shadow, pitching in a space all black
"and writhing; and from the depths of
this darkness great waves ran at him
to sweep him off â increasing in might,
innumerable, extending infinitely â¢ into
the night.
Then a giant wave delivered Its as
sault; it came ponderouslyâ lifted itself
high above his head, broke above him,
fell, beat him down; it swept him back,
rolling him over and over, but he
caught abridge of ice with his fingers,
and he held his place, though the wa
ters tugged at him mightily. He recov
ered- his -first position, and again he
was beaten down; but. again he rose to
face the sea, and again a weight of wa
ter crushed him , to his knees. Thus
three more times without pause;. then,
a respite, in which it was made known
to him that one. other had survived.
"Be it you, Matthew?" said Saul.
"Noaâ 'tis Andrew Butts. I be fair
done out, Saul." .
Saul gathered his strength to con-
dnue the fightâ to meet the stress and
terrors of the hours to come; for it wu
without quarter, this fight; there is no
mercy in cold, nor is there any compas
sion In the great deep. Soon â it may
have been two hours after the assault
of the five great wavesâ the seas came
with new venom and might; they were
charged with broken ice, massed frag
ments of the pack, into which the wind
had driven the pan, or, it may be. with,
the slush of pans which the Blueblack
Shoal had discharged. The ice added
weight and a new terror to the waves.
They bruised and dazed and sorely
hurt the man when they fell upon him.
No wave came but carried Jaggad
chunks of ice â some great and some
small; and these they flung at the men
on the pan. needing only to strike here
or there to kill them.
Saul shielded his head with his arms.
He was struck on the legs and on the
left side, and once be was struck on
the left breast and knocked down.
After a while â it may have been an
hour after the fragments first appeared
in the waterâ he was struck fair on the
forehead; hia senses wavered, but his
strength continued sufficiently* and
soon he forgot that he had so nearly
been fordone. Agalr.. after a tlmaâ It
may now have been three hours before .
midnightâ other great waves came.
They broke over his head. They cast
their weight of ice upon him. There
seemed to be no end to their number.
Once, Saul, rising from whera they
had beaten him â rising doggedly to
face them againâ found that his right
arm was powerless. He tried to lift it.
but could not. He felt a bonÂ« grata
over a bone in his shoulderâ and a stab
of pain. So he shielded his head from
the Ice in the next wave with his left
arm â and from the Ice in the. next, and
in the next, and the next. â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢ The
wave had broken his collarbone.
And thus, in diminishing degree, for
fifteen hours longer.
The folk of Neighborly Cove say that
when the wind once more herded the
pack and drove it Inshore. Saul Nash,
being alone, made his way across four
miles of loose ice to the home of Abra
ham Coachman, in the lee of God's
Warning, Sop's Arm way, where they
had cornmeal for dinner; but Saul has
forgotten thatâ this and all else that
befell him after the sea struck him
that brutal blow on the shoulder; the
things of . the whirling night, of the
lagging dawn, when the snow thinned
and ceased, and of the gray, frowning
day when the waves left him in peace.
A crooked shoulder, which healed of
itself, and a broad scar, which slants
"from "the tip of his nose far up into
hia hair, tell him that the fight was
hard. But what matterâ all this?
Notwithstanding all, when the next
sea baited its trap with swarming
herds, he set forth with John, his
brother, to the hunt; for the world
which lies hidden in thÂ« wide beyond
has some strange need of seal fat. and
stands ready to pay, as of course. It
pays gold to the man at the counter
in St. Johns, and for what the world
pays a dollar the outport warrior gets
a pound of reeking pork.
But what matter? What matter
all this toU and peril? "What matter
when the pork lies steaming on the
table and the yellow duff ia in plenty
in the dish? What. matter when, be
holding it, the blue eyes of the lads
and little maids flash merrily? What
matter when the strength of a man
provides so bounteously that his chil
dren may pass their plates for more ?
What matterâ when there comes a
night wherein a man may rest? What
matterâ in the end? Ease is a shame;
and, for truth, old. age holds nothing
for any man save a seat .In a. corner
and the sound of voices drifting in. Jj
Bill was an old hand â an old hand;
and he had been in the thick . of the
pitiless slaughter of seals for five days.
"Us'll. let noa moare . aboard, b'y," he
cried. He started to his elbow and
looked around; but he saw' no one
making for the pan, so he said to. Saul:
" 'Tis too small for three. .Leave the'
young feller loo.; out' for hlsself; some
otherâ
"Bill," said Saul, "the lad bides here."
Bill was an old hand. He laughed in
scorn. Maybe," said he, "if the sea gets
at this pan â to-morrow, ornex' day,
Saul â if. the sea gets at un, an' wears
un down, .'tis yourselfll be the first t*
push the lad off, an' notâ \ , . '
"Does you hear. me, Bill! I says the
lad '-^â " 'Â¦Â¦'â¢ Â¦. , -.
John plucked Saul's sleeve. "'Tis
goaln' abroad,".. he, said, sweeping his
hand over the pack!' . ;-.'.-,:â¢ ' .
- Then a hush fell upon the iceâ a hush
that deepened and spread, and soon left;
only the swish of the gale :and l the
mufflled roar of the shoal. - It came
creeping from the- west like a sign of
relief. - The driving force of the -wind
had - somewhere been mysteriously
counteracted. The pressure was i with
drawn. The pack was free. It would
disperse into its separate parts. A veer
ing of the . windâ the Impact" of some
vagrant ' fieldâ a * current' or ' a tideâ a
far-off rock; who knows what influence?
The direction of the pack was changed.
It would swerve outward from the
Blueblack shoal.
Ol' Bill fell, exhausted. He shielded
his mouth with his arm. " 'Tis so good
as any. place," he 'gasped. " i
" 'Tis big enough . : for . seven men,"
said John., v -. â¢ :
Save upon the scattered pans, which
had resisted the grinding of the pack,
but were even then lifting themselves
out of the press and failing back in
pieces; save upon those few pans, there
was no place, where a man could rest
his foot/foftrhere he set -it down there
it sank. He must leap â leap â from one
sinking fragment. to another, ch'ooslng
in a flash where next to alight; chanc
ing his weight where it might be sus
tained, for the moment of gathering to
leap againâ he ; :must leap 7 without
pause; he must leap 'or the 4 pack, woiild
let him through and close over his
head. Moreover the wind â¢' swept over
the pack with full force and a sting
ing touch, and it was filled ' with the
dust of snow; a- wind which froze and
choked and blinded where it could. But
in the lead.of. SaulNash^swho was like
a swaying shadow in the snow ahead,
thirty men made the hundred yards
and dispersed to the pans 'to waitâ
thirty of thirty-three, not counting the
skipper, who had lingered far back to
see the last of the work of his hands.
"Leave usâ waitâ here," said Saul, be
tween convulsive pants, ..when, ' with
John and ol' . Bill Anderson, Â¦' he had
come to rest on a small pan. He turned
his back to- the - wind to catch a his
breath. "Us'll clear 'the shoalâ here,"
he added. ,.-' * / .
"Is you all here?" the skipper went
on. He ran his eye ever them to count
them. No man looked around for his
friends! â¢ '"Thirty- three. All right! Men.
you'll follow Saul Nash. When you gets
a hundred yards off the ship you'll
drift clear o'. the shoal. Now, over the
side, all hands!" In a lull of the wind
the shoal seemed suddenly very near.
"Lively, men! Lively!"
The schooner was' low with her
weight of seaf-fat. It was but a short
leap to the pack in which she was
caughtâ at most, but a swinging drop
from the rail. That jivas all; even so,
as the crew went over" the side the
shadow of the great terror fellâ fell as
from a cloud approaching. There was
a rush to be clear of this doomed thing
of wood â to be first in the way of es
cape, though the end cf the untraveled
path was a shadow; so there was a
crowding at the rail, an outcry, a
snarl and the sound of a blow.
Young John Nash was in the shelter
of Saul'B great body; he was touching
the skirt of the man's great-coatâ like
a child in a crowd. 'â¢â¢ ( t
The old man was up on the port rail
with the snow curling about him. He
had a grip of the mainmast shrouds to
stay himself against the wind and the
lunging of the ship. The thud ar\d
swish of waves falling back and the
din bf grinding ice broke from the
depths of the snow over the bow â from
some place near and hidden â and the
gale was roaring past. The men
crowded closer to hear him.
"Tis -time t' take t' the ice!'? he cried.
"Iss, skipper!'*" â¢ â¢
"Sure, sir." ; â¢
. In the words of the Newfoundlander,
it would soon be every man for his life
â that dread hour. when, by the /ac
cepted creed of that coast, earth is In
mercy curtained from heaven and the
Impassive angel's ' book is closed. At
Buch times, escape is for j the strong;
the weak aslc, for no help; Ahey are
thrust aside; they find no hand
stretched, out. Compassion, and all the
other kin of love, being overborne in thu
tumult, flee the hearts of men;, there
remains but the brute greed of llfe-^
more life. Every man for his own lif eâ
for bis life. Each watched the other
as though that other sought to wrest
some advantage from him. Such was
the temper of the men then that '"-when
the skipper roared for all hands there
was a rush for the .ladder and a 'scuffle
for place at the foot of it.
"Men," the skipper bawled, when the
crew had huddled amidships, cowering
from the wind, "the ship'll strike the
Blueblack inside o* thirty minutes. 'Tis
every man for his life." , j\ â¢ ;. '.
'warm while there was yet timeâ that
they might be warm and supple* In the
crisis. Also they ate their fill of pork
and biscuit and drank their fill of
water? being wise in the ways of ice,
each stuffed his stomach, which they
call In such times with ' grim
humor the long pocket Some
took off their jackets to give
their arms freer , play in the coming
fight; some tightened their belts; some
filled their pockets with the things'they
loved most; all made ready. Then they
sat down to wait, and the waiting, in
that sweltering, pitching hole, with its
shadows - and flickering j light, ' ; was
voiceless and fidgety. It was the brew
ing time of panic, -
It began to , snow; not. In feathery
flakes, eilent and soft, but the whizzing
dust of flakes, which . eddied and ran
with the wind In blasts, that .stung.
Most of the crew went below to get
He looked her over from stem to
Etern â along her shapely rail, and aloft,
over the detail of her rigging. His
glance lingered here and thereâlin
gered wistfully. She was his life's
achievement; he had bullded her.
"Iss, ekipper. sirâ sure 'tis," said
Baul Nash. He lurched to the skip
per's side and put a hand on his shoul
der.
. _".' 'Twere a good Vyage, skipper." ol'
Bill AnderBon said, lifting his voice
above the noise of the pack.
"'Twere a gran' haul off the Grey
Islandsâ now. 'twere." said the skipper.
" Twere so good as ever I knowed
from a schooner," said Anderson.
"I hates t' lose them pelts/' said the
Ekipper. "I do hate V lose them pelts."
"Never yet were I wrecked with
bloody decks." said Anderson, "that I
didn't eay 'twas a pity .t" lose the car
go. Never, b'yâ never! I says every
time, says 1, 'twas a pity t' lose the
pelts."
Just then Saul's young brother, John,
approached the group and stood to
listen. He was a slight, brown-eyed
boy, having the flush of health, true,
and a conspicuous grace, but dark eyes
Instead of blue ones, and small meas
ure of the bone and hard flesh of his
mates. Saul moved under the fore
mast Ehrouds and beckoned him over.
"John, b'y," the man said. In a ten
der â¢whisper, leaning ovtr, "keep along-
Elde o* me when â when â Come,", burst
ing Into forced heartiness, "there's a
cood lad, now; keep alongside o" me."
John caught his breath. "Iss, Saul,"
he whispered. Then he had to moisten
his lips. "Iss, I will," he added, quite
steadily. r Â£j
"John!" In a low. Inspiring cry.
"Saul!"
The ewlft upward glanceâ the quiv
ering glance, darting from the depths,
which touched Saul's bold blue eyes for
a flash and shifted to the dull sky
betrayed the boy again. He was one
of those poor, dreamful folk who fear '
the sea. It may be that Saul loved him
for thatâ for that strange difference.
"Close alongside, John, b'y," Baul
mumbled. " touching the" lad on the
choulder, but not daring to look In his
face. "Close â close alongside o\ me."
' "lea. Saul."
"Sure, men," said the skipper, " 'tis
barb'rous hard t' lose the schooner â
barb'rous hard t' lose her," he bawled,
v.lth a glance about and a shake of
the head.
The shoal lay dead ahead in the path
of the schooner's drift. In every part
of it waves shook themselves free of
ice and leaped high into the windâ all
white and. frothy against the . 6ky.
Â¦which was of the drear color of lead.
Its tons were lifted and -cast^tlownâ -
smashed â crunched; great pans werÂ«
turned to the finest fragments with
crashing and groaning and hissing. The
rocks stuck out of the sea like iron
teeth. They were as nothing before
the momentum of the packâ no hin
drance to Its Blow, heavy onrush. The
ice scraped over and between them,
end, with the help of the waves, they
ground it up in the passage. The shoal
.was like some gigantic machine. It
Â¦uas fed by the wind, which drove the
pack: it was big as the wind is big.
Massive chunks came through in
Blush.
They followed the direction of his
arm, from the tip of his frozen mitt to
the nearest shoal, dead ahead, where
the tea was grinding the ice to slush.
Death confronted them, but they said
nothing. Yet they were not callousâ
every man loved his life; each had a
f.ne regard for Its duties and delights.
But the schooner was in the grip "of
the pack, which the wind, not their
will, controlled. There was nothing to
be done â no call upon strength or un
derstanding. Why talk? So they wait
ed to see what the wind would do with
the pack.
"Well, men," the skipper drawled at
last, "she'll wreck. Seems that way t'
me â It do." â¢ .
"Does you see unâ 'the Blueblack â

the confusion of ice and wind had over
whelmed his voice.

driving sou'west with the gale. ThÂ«
light in creased; It disclosed the faces of
men to men â frozen cheeks, steaming
mouths, beards weighted with icicles,
eyes flaring In dark pits. It disclosed
the decks, where s> litter of gaffs and
clubs end ropes* ends lay frozen in the
blood and fat of slain seal, the grimy
deck house and galley, the wrecked
bowsprit, the abandoned wheel, the
rigging and spars all sheathed with
Ice; and, beyond, es it pushed Its way
Into the uttermost shadows, the solM
shape of Deadly Rock and the Blue
black Shoal lying In the path of the
wind.
"Does you see un, men?"* said the
skipper.
They were seven old hands who had
gathered with the 6klpper by the wind
lass to wait for the morning, and they
had been on the watch the night long â
big, thick-chested fellows, heavy with
muscles and bones â most with forbid
ding, leathery faces, which were not
cnused, however, at other times, to the
play of a fine simplicity â men of knot
ty oak, with that look of strength, from
the ground up, which some gnarled old
tree has; and they were all clothed in
Fkln boots and caps, and some coarse,
home made stuff, the last In a way so
thick and bulky that it made giants of
them.

THE STRENGTH
OF MENIt" was a frightful paceâ how fright
ful no one ever knew; neither the old
man Sinclair nor ; Dick Burns ever
cared. Only, the crew of a freight,
sidetracked for. the approaching Flyer,
saw. an engine flying. light;- knew the
hunter and the quarry, for they had
been the runaways shoot, byâ saw then,
a minute after, 1 a star and a streak and
a | trail ot rotten smoke fiy down [ the
/wind, and she had come and passed and
gone. , '.
It ' was ' just ; east of '. that siding, so
Burns and Sinclair always maintained
âhut It measured ten thousand feet
year* roll by there will be an ampla
number of claimants for the revenue
derived from this magni-cent gift. But
it Is preposterous to suppose that all
of those who ought to be rewarded will
receive their just dues. And under
neath all the specific instances of heroic
action must be at all times the sub
stratum of a vast deal of " heroism
which never gets into the public prints.
It Is of these unpublished heroisms that
we may profitably think to-day.
Is the heroism of the battlefield any
nobler than that of the" sickroom, not
alone of the persons condemned to long
and apparently unending years of in
valid 13m, but of those who minister
unto them? I am thinking now not of
paid nurses and attendants, but of rel
atives and friends who spend consid
erable time night and day In caring for
the sick. The man whose wife Is a con
firmed invalid carries a heavy burden.
Hard as It is to be deprived of her
compasiy and co-operation . in the Joys
and the work of life, it is still harder to
see your dearest one wasting with dis
ease, the victim of unstrung nerves or
of unsound organs. Many a man goes
to his business in the morning heavy
hearted and returns "at night Â¦ In deep
anxiety because ill health lias com* to
the throttle and on tne air; the very
magic of touch which, on a slender
bar of steel, could push a hundred tons
of flyins metal up and hold it steady
in a play of six inches^n the teeth of
the gale that tore down behind him.
Again and "again Burns tried to
couple and failed. Sinclair, straining
anxiously ahead, caught sight of the
headlight of No. 1 rounding O'Fal
lons Bluffs. - â¢Â¦''Â¦"
He cried to Burns, and, incredible
though U seems, the fireman heard.
Above all the infernal din, the tearing
of the fiangea and the roaring of the
wind. Burns heard the cry. It nerved
him to a supreme effort. He slipped
the eye once .: more on ; the draw and
managed to drop his pin. Up went his
hand in signal. .
Choking the steam, Sinclair- threw
the brake-shoes flaming against the
big drivers. The sand poured on the
raSs, and with Burns up on the coal
ers setting brakes the three great run
aways were brought . to with a jerk,
that would , have astounded Â¦. the, most
reckless .scapegraces in the world.
While the plucky fireman cypt along
the top of the freight cars to keep
from being blown bodily ; through ' : the
air, Sinclair, with every resource. that
brain and nerve and power, could ex
ert, wa3: struggling to overcome^ the
terrible , headway of , pursuer and 'pur
sued, : driving Â¦ now frightfully into the
beaming bead of No. L .
r' . 'â¢ '
before. He was a' tall, lank Irish boy
with an open face and' a morning smile.
Dad Sinclair took him on because no
one else would have him. Burns was
so green that Foley said you couldn't
set his name afire.: He would, so Foley
said, put out a hot box just by blink
ing at it. -
But every man's turn comes once,
and it had come for Burns. It' was
Dick Burns' chance now to show what
manner, of stuff was bred in his long
Irish, bones. It was bis task to make
the steam â if he could â faster than
Dad Sinclair could burn it. What use
to grip the throttle and scheme if
Burns didn't furnish the power, put
life into her heels as she raced the
wind â .the merciless, relentless gala
sweeping over . the prairie faster than
a' horse could fly before it?*
. Working smoothly and swiftly into a
dizzy whirl, the monstrous drivers took
the steel in leaps and bounds. Dad
Sinclair, leaning from the cab window,
gloatingly watched their .gathering
speed, iml Jed. the bar up , notch by
notch, and fed Burns' fire into the old
engine's arteries fast and faster than
she could throw it into her steel hoofs.
That was 'the night the West End
knew that a greenhorn had cast j his
chrysalis and stood out a man. Knew
that the honor; roll of our frontier di
vision wanted one more name, and that
it was big Dick Burns'. Sinclair hung
silently desperate to the throttle, , his
eyes straining into the night; ahead,
and the face of the long Irish boy,
: streaked with smut and channeled
' with sweat, - lit . every minute with .the
glare of. the furnace as he fed the
white-hot blast that leaped, and' curled
and foamed under the crown-sheet of
Soda-Water Sal. :
There he stooped and sweat and
swung, â¢ a3 she slewed and lurched and
jerked across the fishplates.' Carefully,
nursingly,. ceaselessly he pushed Y the
steam-pointer higher, higher, higher on
the dialâ and that despite the tremen
dous drafts of Dad's throttle. *
' Never a' glance to the right or the
left, to the track or the engineer. From
go Into her sure." "Dad." cried Rey
nolds, all in a fright, "what'll I do?
For heaven's sake do something. I
called up Riverton and tried to catch
No. 1, but she had passed. I was too
late. There'll be a wreck, and I'm
boofted for the penitentiary. What can
I do?" AH the while the station agent,
panic-stricken, rattled on. Sinclair was
looking at his watchâ casting it up â
charting it all under his thick, gray,
grizzled wool, fast as thought could
compass.
No. 1 headed for Acton, and her pace
was a hustle every mile of the way;
three cars of coal blocking down on her
âhow fast he. dared not think; and
through it all he was asking himself
what. day it was. Thursday? Up! Tes,
Georgie, his boy. was on the Flyer No.
1. It was his day up. If they met on a
curve â
"Uncouple her!" roared Dad Sinclair,
in a giant tone.
"What are you going to do?" - :
. "Burns," thundered Dad to his â¢ fire
man, "give her steam, and quick, boy!
Dump In grease, waste, oil, everything!
Are you clear there?" he cried/opening
the throttle as he looked back.
The old engine, pulling clear of her
coaches, quivered as she gathered her
self under steam. She leaped ahead
with a swish. The drivers churned In
the sand, bit Into It with gritting tires,
and forged ahead with a suck and a
hiss and a roar. Before Reynolds had
fairly gathered his wits, Sinclair, leav
ing his train on the main track in front
of the depot, was clattering over the
switch after the runaways. The wind
was a terror, and they had too good
a start. But the way Soda- Water Sal
took the gait when she once felt her
feet under her made the wrinkled en
gineer at her throttle set his mouth
with the grimness of a gamester.'. It
meant the runawaysâ and catch themâ Â¦
or the ditch for Soda-Water Sal; "and
the throbbing old machine seemed to
know it. for her nose hung to the steel
like the snout of a pointer. â¢ "
He was a man of a hundred even
thenâ Burns; but nobody knew it, then.
We hadn't thought much about Burns
DURING the weeks which have
passed since Mr. Carnegie'3 es
; tablishment of his hero fund in

Tet I have known men who have borna
even this trial with serenity, couraga
and trust in an all-wise, overruling
Providence.
What about the small army of per
sons who give up cherished plans and
strong ambitions for a home of their
own in order to take care of Infirm par
ents or other relatives who need not
only physical assistance, but cheerful
companionship day by day, who want
to be read to, talked to, amused, di
verted, who want some one else to be to
them sunshine or even life Itself. Wa
all know daughters who thus stand loy
ally by aging and sometimes aggravat
ing mothers, sons and younger brothers
who cheerfully take up a cross of this
sort. Their unpublished heroism de
serves as high praise as that of a man
who risks his, life to carry another per
son from a burning building. -
' Another group of unpublished hero
isms comprises those sacrifices mada
in order to give advantages to childGen
or to brothers and sisters. I know more
than one successful business man
whose mental poverty and social dis
abilities are due to the fact that ha
began in his early days to maks- his
own living, and before, ha was 20 to
take care of his younger brothers and
sisters. He went into the factory or
the warehouse that they might go to
college. He scrimped that they might
have money for tuition and books.- Ho
saw them growing In brain power,
while his crowded days left him no
opportunity to look within the covers
of a book. He is now past middle life.
Tet he S would not do differently were
he to live his life over again. He
knows the greatest of all joys, that of
pouring himself Into the life of an
other. No one speaks of him as a hero,
but he has been just that all thesa
years.
Tt" m Is something heroic, too, about
the man who retrieves his fortunes,
after having met with some great re
verses. It is easy to begin at the bot
tom of the hill when one Is young, but
when one has reached the time of life
of Mr. McKlnley when he suffered
financial disaster, Jx. takes a brava
heart to start all over agin. Tet men
all over this land are doing this thing
every day. They refuse to be dis
appointed and discouraged. They will
risk another venture, and whether they
win out or. not the mere fact that they
are ready to try with all their might
entitles them to a place amon* the
unbrevetted, unadorned heroes of the
race.
" Don't, In your search of heroes, look
exclusively at the ranks of policemen,

SOME UNPUBLISHED
HEROISMS
BY THE PARSON
IL
WHEN the great engine which
\tc called the Sky-Scraper
came out of the Zanesville
shops she was rebuilt from
pilot to tender.
Our master mechanic. Neighbor, had
in idea, after her terrific collision, that
the could not stand the heavy xnaln-
Jne jiassenger runs, so he put her ( on
Ihe Acton cut-off. It was what rail-
road men call a jerkwater run, what
ever that may be; a little jaunt of ten
3iiles across the divide connecting the
northern division with the Denver
item. It was just about like running a
trolley and the run was given to Dad
Sinclair, for after that lift at Oxford
bis back was never strong enough to
shovel coal, and he had to take an
tngir.e or Quit railroading.
Thus It happened that after many
years he took the throttle once more
and ran over, twice a day, as he does
>et, from Acton to Willow Creek.
His boy, Georgie Sinclair, tlje kid
Engineer, took the run on the Flyer
apposite Foley, just as soon as he got
Georfrie. who never was happy un
less he had eight or ten Pullmans be
hind him and the right of, wayi over
â¢verythir.g between Omaha and Den
ver, made great sport of his father's
littie s-moking-car and day-coach be
hhul the fcijr engine.
Foley made Fport of the remodeled
?nc;ij:t. He- used to stand by while
:hc old vncineer was oiling and asked
Trim whether he thought 6he could
catch a. jack rabbit. "I mean," Foley
tvouM say, "if the rabbit was feeling
t\e!l."
Dad Sinclair took it all grimly and
quietly; he had railroaded too long to
Â»are for anybody's chaff. But, onÂ«
day. after the Sky-Scraper had gotten
her f.ues pretty well chalked up with
Rllcali, Foley insisted that she must be
renamed.
"1 have the only genuine sky-scraper
on the West End now myself," declared
Foley. He did have a new class H
engine, and she was awe-inspiring, in
truth. "I don't propose," he continued,
"to have her confused with your old
tub any longer, Dad."
Dad, oiling his old tub affectionately,
erswered never a word.
"She's full of soda, isn't she, father?"
asked Georgie. standing by.
"Reckon the is, my son."
"Full of water, I suppose?"
"Try to keep her that way, eon.**
"Sal-soda, isn't it. Dad?"
"N'ow, I can't say. As to that â I
can't say."
"We'll call her Sal Soda, Georgie,"
suggested Foley.
"No," interposed Georgie; "stop a
bit. I have it. Not Sal Soda at all
make It Soda-Water Sal."
Then they laughed uproariously; and
In the teeth of Dad Sinclair's protests
âfor he objected at once and vigor
ously â the queer name stuck to the
engine and sticks yet.
To have seen the great hulking ma
rhlne you would never have suspected
there could be another story left In
her. Tet one there was; a story of the
Rind. As she stood, too, when old
man Sinclair took her on the Acton
run, the was the best Illustration I
have ever seen of the adage that one
ran never tell from the looks of a frog
bow far he will Jump.
Have you ever felt the wind? Not,
( think, unless you have lived on the
%fzs or the plains. People everywhere
think that the wind blows, but it really
blows only on the ocean and the
prairies.
The summer that Dad took the Acton
run It blew for a month steadily. All
of one Augustâ hot. dry, merciless; the
jcppalr of the farmer and the terror
af trainmen.
It was an August evening, with the
gale still sweeping up from the south
west, that Dad came lumlerlng Into
Acton with his little trolley train. He
had barely pulled up at the platform
to unload his passengers when the sta
ti>m agent, Morris Reynolds, coatlese
and hatless, rushed up to the engine
ahead of the hostler and sprang into
the cab. Reynolds "Â¦was one of the
quietest fellows in the service. To see
him without a coat or hat didn't count
for much in such weather, but to see
him sallow with fright and almost
Epeechless was enough to stir even old
Dad Sinclair.
It was not Dad's habit to ask ques
tions, but he looked at the man in .
questioning amazement.* Reynolds
cheked and caught his breath, as he
seized the engineer's arm and pointed
down the line.
"Dad," he gasped, "three cars of
coal standing there on the second spur
blew loose a few minutes ago."
"Where are they?"
"Where are they? Blown through
the switch and down the line, forty,
miles an hour."
The old man grasped the frightened
man by the shoulder. "What do you
mean? How long ago? When Â«s it due?
Talk quick, man! What a the matter
â¢with you?*'
"Not five minutes ago. No..l is due
here-ia less than thirty minutes; they'll
eastâ that they caught them.
:A shout from Dad brought the drip
ping fireman up standing, and, look
ing ahead, he saw jn the blaze of
their own headlight the string of coal
ers standing still ahead of them. So
it "_ seemed to him, their own speed
was bo great,. and the runaways were
almost equallng.it, "They were
ing forty miles , an hour when- they
dashed past the paralyzed freight
crew.
Without "Raiting for .:' ordersâ what
orders dfd such a man need?â without
a.word.'Burns crawled "out of his win
dow with a ""pin- and ra8 forward on
the. footboard, clinging the- v best he
could, as the engine dipped and;lurch
ed, climbed- down on , the " cow-catcher
and lifted "the' pilot 'bar to couple. It
was a cfazy thing to attempt. He was
much likelier; to get; under the" pilot
than to succeed; yet he tried it.
- Then -it was that the fine hind of
Dad\Slnclalr came into play. To tem
per the : speed enough â and- just
enough; to push her nose enough and
far enough for Burns to make the Â¦
draw-bar of. the runawayâ that was
the nicety of the big, seamed hands on
maybeâ the son and father, -and thÂ»
father and son.
For brave men do get scared; don't
believe anything else. But between
the fright of a coward and the fright
of a brave man there is this difference:
the "Â» ward's scare is apparent before
the danger, that of the brave man after
it has passed; and Burns laughed with
a tremendous mirth "at th' two o* thim
a-jawln'," as he expressed it.
No man on the West End could turn
on his pins quicker than Georgia Sin
clair though, if his hastiness misled
him. When it all came clear ha climb
ed into the ild cab â the cab he him
self had once gone against death Inâ
and with stumbling words tried to
thank the tall Irishman, who still
laughed in the excitement of havins
won.
And when Neighbor, next day^
thoughtful and taciturn, heard It all.
he very carefully looked Soda-Water
Sal all over again.
"Dad." said he, when the boys got
through telling it for the last time,
"she's a better machine than I thought
she was." y i Â¦â
"There isn't a better pulling your
coaches," maintained Dad Sinclair,
stoutly. Â¦/->"â¢Â¦
"I'll put her on the main line, Dad,
and give you the 16S for the cut-off.
Eh?"
"The 168 will suit me. Neighbor; any
old tub â eh. Foley'" said Dad. turning
to the cheeky engineer, who had com*
up in time to hear most of the talk.
The old fellow had not forgotten Fo
ley's sneer at Soda -Water Sal when ha
rechristened her. But Foley. too, had
changed his mind and was ready to
give In.
"That's quite right. Dad." he ac
knowledged. "You can get more out
of any old tub on the division than
the rest of us fellows can get out of a
Baldwin consolidated. I mean it, too.
It's the best thing I ever heard of.
What are you going to do for Burns,
Neighbor?" asked Foley, with his us
ual assurance.
"I was* thinking I would give him
Soda- Water Sal, and put him on the
right side of the cab for a freight run.
I reckon he earned it last night."
In a few minutes Foley started off
to hunt up Burns.
"See here, Irish," said he. In his off
hand way, "next time you catch a
string of runaways just remember to
climb up the ladder and set your
brakes before you couple; it will save
a good deal of wear and tear on thÂ»
pilot-barâ see? I hear you're going to
get a run: don't fall out the window
when you get over on the right."
And that's how Burns was mads an
engineer, and how Soda-Water Sal
was rescued from the disgrace of run
ning on the trolley.
With the Johnson bar over and the
drivers dancing a gallop backward;
with the sand striking fire and the rails
burning under it;, with the oldSky-
Scraper shivering again in a terrific
struggle and Burns twisting the heads
off the brake-rods; with every trick
of old Sinclair's cunning, and his boy
duplicating every one of them in the
cab of No. 1â still they came together.
It was too fearful a momentum, to
overcome, when minutes mean miles
and tons are reckoned by thousands.
They came together; but instead of
an appalling wreckâ destruction and
deathâ it was only a bump. No. 1 had
the speed when thev met, and it was
a car of coal dumped a bit . sudden
and a nose on Georgie's engine like a
full-back's after a center rush. The
pilot doubled back into the ponies and
the headlight was scoured with nut,
pea and slack, but the stack was hard
ly bruised. ,
The minute they struck. Georgia Sin
clair, making fast, and, leaping from
his cab, ran forv.-ard In the dark, pant
ing with rase and excitement. Burns,
.torch in hand, was himself just Jump
ing Â«| down to set forward. His face
wore Us usual grin, even when Georgie
assailed him with a torrent of abuse.
"What do you mean, you red-headed
lubber?" he shouted, with much the
lungs of his father. "What are you
doinp: switching coal here on the main
line?" â¢ "
. In fact. Georgie called the astonished
fireman everything he could think oi,
until his father, who was- blundering
forward on his side of the engine, hear
ing the voles/ turned and -ran -around
behind the tender to take a hand him
self.
"Mean?" he roared above the blow
of his safety. "Mean?" he bellowed
in the teeth of the wind. "Mean? Why,
you impudent, empty-headed, ungrate
ful rapscallion, what do you mean
;oming around, here to abuse a man
?hat's saved you and your train from
the scrap?"
-And !big Dick .Burns, standing by
with his torch, bur*st into an Irish
laugh, fairly doubled up before the
nonplused boy., and listened with
great Relish to the excited father and
son. It" was not hard to understand
Georgie's amazement and anger at
finding Soda- Water Sal behind three
cars of coal half way between stations
on the main line and on his time â and
that the fastest time on the division.
But what amused Burns most was to
see the Imperturbable old Dad pitching
into his Â¦ boy - with as much spirit as
the young man himself showed.
It was because both men were scared
out of, their wits; scared over their
narrow escape from a frightful wreck;
from having each killed the other,

SODA-WATER SAL"It ain't so preen, do," persisted the
tousled one. "Dere's mighty few
tings so green as grass. Do there is
some," he added, reflectively.
Middleton took this last remark as
a rejection on his own knowledge of
farming. So he indignantly ordered
the tousled boy to leave the barn. The
boy rlouched sulkily away, black
wrath in his heart.
But the bor's remark had suggested
an idea to Middleton.

are concerned.
When the familr moved to the sub
urbs Middleton determined to keep
a cov.-. Everything went well until
winter set in. when the cow, after the
manner of her kind, did not eive the
accustomed supply of milk. This con
duct of the cow's j:irred upon Middle
ton's business instincts. He consid
ered it yiure laziness. The tousled
headed boy whom he had hired to
look after the cow explained that it
wasn't bad-heartedness on the part of
the cow, but a lack of gross that was
responsible for the decrease in the
Middleton milk supply.
"But Fhe has plenty of hay," Mid
dleton objected. "And hay is just as
nourishing- as crass."
as grass. If she supposed she was
eating grass she would give as much
milk as before, even if her food sup
ply happened really to be hay."
"She may be a credulous cow," re
plied Mr?. Middleton in doubtful tones.
"But how even your flow of persuasive
words can make her believe hay is
gross is more than I can se?."
But Mrs. Middleton's incredulity did
not decrease her husband's ardor in
his plan for revolutionizing dairy
farming. The next morning Middle
ton went to an optician and left an
order for an unusually large pair of
plain, green glass spectacles. In the
afternoon, gloatinc over his scheme
for an increased milk supply, i he
marched triumphantly out to the barn.
ThÂ° cow didn't seem to understand
why she should wear spectacles, as she
had never made. any complaint of fail
ing eyesight. But after a little .she
became somewhat recon
ciled to them. Middloton
kicked around some hay, <itiw$L,
so that it would look like
grass thrown on the floor /gggilff
of the barn. Then he
went back to the house
to explain more fully to -g||
Mrs. Middleton the benefits 'â¢^
which- would accrue froni
his idea.
About an hour later the tousled
headed boy entered the barn. The
cow was eating the hay, but she cer
tainly was a much puzzled animal.
Her eyesight showed that it was
green and it looked like grass.
But it was dry and didn't
in the Jeast taste like grass.
By Martha. McC. Williams
HAND OF PROVIDENCE,
He took the spectacles from the
cow's nose, pushed out the . green
glasses and Inserted the red ones. He
replaced the red-glassed spectacles.
Then he hastily climbed Into the hay
mow and awaited developments.
When the crimson spectacles were
adjusted the cow's peace of mind In
stantly vanished. To the right, left,
and in front was to be seen only the
hated colorâ red. Her wrath was
stirred. She made a charge at the
crimson haymow. The only was
that she was thrown back, bruised and
baffled. She glanced around in
anxiety and terror, onlyjo find that all
the objects in the once familiar barn
were the same odious color. Then
she began a mad rush about the barn,
mooing with all the force of her lungs.
The tumult aroused Mlddleton, who
ran from the house and threw open
the barn door. But when the cow saw
a crimson man standing In the door
way, her terror changed to wrath.
Plainly, here was the cause of all her
troubles. She made a mad charg* at
Mlddleton. He side-stepped with an
agility which would have surprised his
business acquaintances. The cow was
unable to stop- and thundered through
the doorway. Then she turned and
prepared for a second charge. Just as
Mlddleton was planning precipitate
flight an unusuallly angry and vehe
ment shake of the cow's, head shook
off the glasses. Things once more re
sumed their natural color.
The cow stood for a moment, be
wildered at the sudden change in her
field of vision, then began to walk
slowly back to the barn, Mlddleton
saw that her rage was over, but was
puzzled to account for It at all.
"Green is the cojor of a good part
of the earth in summer time," he
mused. "I don't see why green spec
tacles should affect a cow with sud
den Insanity."
Then he saw the spectacles lying on
the ground. He picked them up. As
he did so he noticed the red glasses.
He understood what had happened.
"That young rascal must have
changed the glasses. If I catch him
I'll give him a lesson on the evils of
interfering with experiments in scien
tific farming that he'll remember the
rest of his life."
The tousled-headed boy. hidden in
the haymow, wisely gave no Indication
of his whereabouts. Mlddleton ad-
Justed the green glasses and tried to
replace them on the cow. But that
particular cow had had all she cared
for of spectacles of any sort, whether
provided with red or green glasses.
She shook her head In such, a threat
ening manner that Mlddleton finally
abandoned the attempt.
"A scientific experiment that might
have made a revolution In dairy farm
ing spoiled by the malice of & red
headed boy." he sighed as he trudged
back to the house.
"Cows ain't so fierce as bulls,"
thought the tousled one. "But dey
don't like red a bit better."
Now the tousled-headed boy still cher
ished feelings of wrath. When he saw
the spectacles on the cow he. gasped
with amazement.
"Blamed If dat guy ain't put glasses
on dat cow to make her think she 13
eating grass." he murmured.
Just then he happened -to slip nia
hand into one of hi* trousers pockets.
Among the usual treasures stowed
away. In a boy's â¢ pocket his fingers
touched two pieces of glass. He drew
them out. They were red and rOCT
and with a little trouble might be
fitted Into the Â«rims of the spectacles
the cow was wearing. And into the
mind of the tousled one crept a sug
gestion of how he might have revenge
on Mlddleton and a little fun on his
own account. 'â¢
>> t TELL yo', galâ I tell yo' I'd
I rather see yo' dead_ twice over

Befo' I would see it cum about,

Whar's yo'r shame? Whar's the re

was Jlned up to Abe Taylor d'ye reckon
me an' yo'r brother Bill could hang
around yere agin what folks would
say? D'ye think we could look our
nayburs In the face arter that?
High up on the side of the grim old
mountain, father and daughter sat on
the steps of an humble log cabin .on a
summer's afternoon. He was a man of
fifty, loose-jointed and a typical moun
taineer; she was a girl of nineteen.
"An' why?" she finally asked.
"An'- why?" he fiercely repeated as
his eyes flashed.- "If yo' don't know
why then yo' ar' no gal' o' mine!
Heven't I b}n tellin'. yo* why ever since
yo' was able to understand .things?
Wasn't yo' ten y'ars old when I brung

why yo 1 an' Abe Taylor can't Jlne up.
Lawd,. gal, but I wouldn't be mo' aston
ished if yo' struck me a blow in the

"See yere, pop," said the girl, as she
straightened up, clasped her hands
over her knee and looked away Into
the laurels, "Twenty years ago, befo'
I was bo'n, yo' got up a fuss with the
Taylors." Â¦ ,'
"They dun got up a fuss with me,
gal."
"Well, there was a fuss. It was
about a mewl or a hawg or suntbin*.
The Taylors an' the Renfrews went to
killin'. Yo', dun for the old man."
"Yes, by , I did!"
"An* then one. of his boys dun. for

"Shot our Jim down like a dawg an'

"An* then our Bill dun for one o'
them." . â¢-.' â¢
"He did, an' I'm mighty proud o*
him."
"It would give me mooch thangks,"
said Cherries. Then Into her cheeks
came a flush such as Sewall had seen
when he gave her the name.
So that is how Arthur Sewall. writer
of . fiction, came to win his Japanese
bride. '
The next day Sewall gave the tea
at the hotel. His mother had arrived,
and Cherries and the sisters and the
Consul and his wife and a lot of other
Americans were there.
Sewall presented Cherries to the
mother. The "great woman" raised
her lorgnette and regarded the little
girl critically.
"Beautiful!" she exclaimed. "Why
don't you marry her, my boy, and take
her to New York?" She spoke play
fully in English.
"But what was It, that the Honor
able Great Woman was pleased to
say?" asked Cherries.
"She asked why X didn't marry you
â you be my wife, you know." said
Sewall. "Will you?" And his voice
was earnest.
"I am very glad to see you again."
said Sewall. gently. Though in his
heart he wanted to say, "I have want
ed to see you all these weeks."
"Yaes?" said Cherries.
"Yes," said Bewail, as he sat down
on the ground beside her.
And then he told her how his moth
er was coming out from America, and
how she was a very great woman.
"Blgger'n thaet?" said Cherries,
stretching her arms out as far as they
would go. 'â:. ,V,
"WeH. no." replied SewalL Hardly
that big, but I mean that she is a great
woman because she is president of a
lot of societies, and she writes books
and reads papers at clu>>3â and all that
sort of thing."
TCe-us," aaid Cherriesâ and that was
as near as she ever came to saying
"yes."
"And now," continued Bewail, "I
want you to meet my mother. She will
be here to-morrow, and I am to give
a little tea for her at the hotel. Will
you and the sisters come?
"It gives me mooch thangks. Most
Honorable Yellow Hair," said Cherries
as she bowed low and showed the most
marvejously beautiful neck, and the
unusual little curls that clustered at
the back. JEWS
/ -^ The girl ,was 'silent' for. a moment,
rocking to -and fro. Then, In the
same culet, even voice, she said: .
"A quarrel lastin' twenty y'ars an'

CHERRIES
By John Bridges
And so that was the meeting of Se
wall and the little woman whom he
called Cherries.
Sewall was a writer of fiction. Ela
friends said he wrote the "fietlonest**
kind of fictionâ the kind that doesn't
sellâ but somehow he bad managed to
get a book published and the sales had
given him a royalty which he re
ligiously saved In order that he might
go to Japan.
From that day Sewall seemed to
see her everywhere. In the celebra
tions in the garden and In the tea
places where he went for refreshment
there was always the vision of the
little girl be had seen in the day when
the cherries blossomed in the groves.
But it was not in her physical being
that he saw her, for after that first
day he could find her nowhere. He
simply dreamed of herâ and, "Cher
ries" came to be a word that stood
out on every page of the white paper
upon which he tried to. write his Im
pressions of Japan.
Who she was, he did not know. The
American Consul had presented him
to her, and the American Consul had
gone away to Kobe on a mission, so
Sewall could not ask him the name of
the girl who had x charmed him out of
his day's work.
But one day, after two weeks
which had seemed as many years to
Sewall, he found her in the gardens
with her sisters, playing with the
paints and the brushes, painting cher
ry blossoms oh a dainty screen. He
approached and she recognized him
instantly.
"Most August Yellow Hair," she
said, -"it is of pleasantness that my
miserable vision Is . greeted with thy
sight." i
THE day he landed in Japan he
found her In the groves at Ya
mato, when there was celebration
for the coming: of the blossom
which Is worshiped in thÂ« April
weatherâ the blossom of the cherry.
Sewall thought there was only one
name for her and though his vocabu
lary was indistinct and incomplete, ha
managed to make her understand that
he would call her "Cherries."
"Honorable Yellow Hair," she said,
falling Into his mood, "it thangks me,
yaes."

bin father and mother to yo' these
many years, an' I'd never believed that
yo' would throw yo'r own pop <oyer
an* side agin him. Yo' couldn't git
Eill to do' itâ no, not if yo' would offer
him all the land 'twixt yere and the
river." J â¢ i
."I can never make yo' understand,
sighed the girl.' "I love yo' as my
pop, and I'm grateful for all yo'r kind
nesses, but don't yo' see that I can't
pick up this old quarrel an' hate as yo'
do an 1 * feel yo'r feelina for revenge?
It's the same with Abe. He wants
peace and friendliness. Together we
want a weddin' an* cabin home. I
said Abe Taylor is a squar*. man^ If
he wasn't would he dun agree to cum
over yere this evenin' an' hold out his
hand to yo' an' ask yo' to bury, the
past?"
"Abe Taylor comin' over yere?"
asked the father In a voice hardly
above a whisper.
"I'm lookln' for him every mlnlL"
The father rose and entered the
house and took down his loaded rifle,
and when he sat down on the steps
again the weapon lay across his knees.
"Is It for Abe?" asked the girl.
' "For, shore. I'll shoot him dead In
his tracks!" '
"Then yo' ar* a coward, an* I'm no
kin to yo'!" â¢
For a minute they looked Into each
other's eyesâ his showing the darkest
passions â hers revealing contempt â
and then they turned their heads.
Thus they sat for ten minutes without
further speech and the westering sun
sunk to the treetops and blazed full
in their faces and half blinded them.
A sudden step caught their ears and
both turned their heads to the right.
"Abe!" gasped the girl.
"I'll kill him!" growled the man.
Some one turned the corner of. the
house and stood in the full blaze of
the sunset The old, man lifted his
rifle and fired over the girl's. shoulder
before she could raise a hand to pre
vent. For a minute a smoke cloud
hung, low and obscured the body on
the* ground. Then the girl said quietly:
r'.'Pop, you've killed a. man,. but it's
yo'r own son Bill!"
The \ old . man- staggered over and
knelt beside the body, and as he knelt,
his face drawn and haggard and his
breathing whistling in his throat, a
young man turned in from the road
and halted close beside the glrL
"Pop .though^ it was you'!" whis
pered the girl.
Abe nodded his head.
. "Walt .till I bundle my things and
we'll go."
SHADOWS
Mr. Byram had come there exploring
â he felt the need of a wife rather
than the want of one. Bess, who was
tall and twenty, and the very moral of
gracious statellness when she chose
to be, had captivated him out of hand.
Ending- in a feint of flinging Jemmy
upon the open fire. Amelia Improved
tht opportunity to pull her brother's
hair until he howled. They were
twins, and pretty badly spoiled, as
was but natural, since they had grown
up motherless In their grandfather's
house.
â¢TO swing rou by your legs, Prudy,
when I'm a man; you see If I don't."
Jemmy said, trying to scowl, but grin
ning in spite of himself. Tom Rod
man picked the boy up and flung him
across his shoulder, sayi-7 gravely:
"I hate to do it, bat there's nothing
else tor It. Jemmy, I've been tellin'
you this ever so long I'd carry you
to the gypsies If you did not behave
better. Stop wriggling. You can't
get away. But I'll let you kiss 'Mella
and t"he others good-by. Be quick!
You won't ever see them again."
"Kiss 'em all yourself. That's what
you're after." Jemmy the astute piped
huskily, as Tom carried him close to
Aunty Bess. His arms 'were free;
Impishly be laid hold of the two heads
and yanked them together, locking his
hands behind the two necks and hold-
Ing them tight, laughing uproariously
all the while. Tom was a gallant fel
low; he could' do no less than kiss
Bess. If all his heart did belong to
Eweet Miss Prue. And just as he kiss
ed her, who should come in but Mr.
Byram, the rich distant cousin, who
had been for three weeks a guest at
Fairlaw.
" 'Benjamin the Blatant/ Tom Rod
man calls him, ' Bess began, Btill plain
tive. Jemmy came charging at her
with Amelia hot upon his heels, and
shouting: "You hush. Aunty Bess!
You wanter lose me my pony! Mister
Byram Bays he'll give me a Shetland if
I don't let nobody say a word against
him in this house."
"I b'leeve he wants Jem to flcht with
Mister Tom Rodman," Amelia inter
rupted sagely, her head the least bit
aside, "And I ain't goin' to help him
there," ehe added pointedly. " 'Cause
Mister Tom eays I'm his sweetheart
he's goin' to wait for me to grow up.
He thinks I'm a heap prettier*n Aunty
Bess right now." :/>Â«
"How about me?" Prue asked. eIk
tlir.g more than ever. Amelia looked
reflectively, but Jemmy stuck his hands
in his pockets, set his feet far apart,
and said, sticking out his chin after the
manner of his model, Benjamin Byram:
"Why, Prudy, you know nobody will
ever look at you, so long as Aunty Bess
and 'Mella are around,"
"Won't they. Indeed?" Prue queried.
drawing down the corners of her mouth
meekly, although her eyes twinkled.
Jemmy swung on his heel, saying
magisterially: "Course not. Why
you're all freckled same as a turkey
â¢rc. and haven't hardly got meat
enough to wrap up your long bones."
â¢*TJpon my soul! Bay, Miss Prue,
shall I take him out and drown him?"
Tom Rodman asked, coming through
the door as he cpoke. But Jemmy
only grinned at himâ Jemmy was nine
and Prue eighteen. They were the
beit of comrades, despite his brutal
frankness. Prue made a dash at him,
â¢tood him upon his head, then swung
blm by an arm and a leg, chanting:
Tier* bÂ» ccei! Flartn tafl toes!
Vp tfct cblmwy when thÂ» wind blom.
> EMMY was explaining to Amelia:
I 'This is the way you make a hor
\ tus siccus â you get a big book
q) with no printin* in it. and then
paste it full of weeds and flowers
and prass and little bits of bushes but
you have to dry, dry, dry 'em â siccus is
Latin for just as dry as a bone.\
"I wonder, could we put in Benjamin
Byram. esquire?" Bess speculated
plaintively. "Heaven knows he's dry
enough just as he 'stands. Then think
of the relief, if he was once where you
could chut him up and off at will."
Prue giggled outright "He does talk
thirteen to the dozen." 6he said. "But
who wouldn't, with all his chance? T
Nature made him a fool of the first
water, and Fate chipped in by Kivins
him a fortune, and a doting family." .
'.'Ladies and gentlemen, . good-by,"
Mr. Byram began In his most ceremo
nious voice. He got no further. Jem
my went at him like a catapult, bowled
him down and out of the door, only
stopping when his enemy lay pros
trate upon the hall threshold. There
the grown-ups came to the rescue, and
so managed it that Mr. Byram went off
an hour later, somewhat bruised in his
person and self-esteem, but as to his
outer man, whole and speckless. When
the carriage rolled , -away with him,
Tom Rodman drew a long, breath, and
said, as he. tossed a foreign letter to
Bees: "Your sweetheart Is comin'
home by the next steamer; had a cable
this mornlnV You sec, I have - been
writing him things. He trill agree with
me and the late Byram that in all this
there is unmistakably the hand of
Providence." . , ,
"Indeed!" Mr. Byram exploded.
"With my coining, I suppose, for a text.
Well, young ladies; I see in all this the
hand of Providence. A 'Just and ever
watchful God would .notiPermit me to
fall victim to your, mercenary' designs.
No doubt you were -> tetnpted by my
wealth and position, although you are
so wholly Incapable or appreciating a
man of my characterâ','
"Kindly come outside with me be
fore you say any more," Tom Rodman
Interrupted, setting Jemmy down with
a thump and putting himself in front
of Bess, who had grown very white
and had eyes of scorching flame. Prue,
contrariwise, had flushed so scarlet It
hid all her freckles. Tom reached a
hand to her and drew- her toward him,
while be went on steadily: "Your
talk needs a man to hear and answer
It. I'm that man. Bess and Prue' have
no brother, and Mr. Fairlie is past
flghtin' age. But Prue belongs to me,
and that gives me the right to stand
up for 'em. So you come along! We'll
settle this the minute we strike the
turnpike and neutral ground."
"Hush, Tom! Remember he's our
guest!" Bess pleaded. Prue gave her
sweetheart a roguish and heavenly
smile. Amelia looked fit to cry over
the toppling of her aircastle, but
Jemmy turned a handspring by way of
showing his Joy In the "melley." As
he came up standing, be stepped In
front of Byram, swelled out his chest
and said, stoutly:
"Don't you try no crawfish games!
You know you wanted to marry Aunty
Bess! You told me bo, and said I
must court her for you. I ain't very
big, but If you try to go back on her
I'll let you know I can shoot my little
gunâ and that's more than you can do.
We won't have a regular duel, like
grandpa tells about. Let's try a buttin'
match instead, and if I butt you over,
like David did Goliath, you'll propose
to Aunty Bess same as ever and gimme
that Shetland you been talkta' so much
about." â¢â¢Â¦Â¦:. . 'L --Â¦'Â¦
He would have proposed to her the
second day of his visit, never doubting
what answer she would make, but that
his sense of propriety forbade. Be
sides, it would not do to dazzle her
too suddenly â he must let the great
prospects break gently u?on her, as
dawn broke over the 'world. So he
had been nobly impartial in his de
voirsâso much so he had twinges of
conscience whenever he thought of
Prue. She was hardly more than a
schoolgirl, to be sure, but quite mature
enough to break her heart over loss of
him, if she once let herself seriously
believe she had a chance of being Mrs.
Byram.
Of Tom Rodman he had taken no
/nore account than to set him down
as an Impertinent puppy with a knack
of coming in at all hoursâ especially
when Mr. Byram least expected or
wanted him. To discover him kissing
Bess in -the face of everybody made
Benjamin the Blatant simply furious.
All the more furious that Jemmy cried
out gleefully: "Mr. Byram! Mister
Byram! Come help me hold 'em. They
tried to skeer me, but I'm beatin' 'em
at their own game."
"Let loose, you little varmint! Shut
up!" Tom commanded. Prue made a
dash at the tangle and deftly un
twined Jemmy's fingers, letting Bess
escape. Mr. Byram stood speechless in
wrath and amazement, until Amelia,
sidling up to him, slid her hand within
his and said, with the least toss of the
head: "They ain't behavin' ugly â
Mister Tom will be Aunty Bess'
nephew when he marries meâ and the
Fairies always Was their kinfolk, if
they ain't too far off and. great big
stuffs into the bargain â Prue and
Aunty Bess said so the first night you
came."
THE SAN/ FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL'.
â¢â¢It's ail imagination on th-e part <5f
that cow to think hay is not as good
THE CRIMSON VISIONEDwaa the reason. Rob, with his eyes in
his plate and a general Ur of dreams,
smiled, end waited prudently for the
Btorm to gather or blow over. But
lightning struck him when he was least
prepared for it. Mldmeal his father
turned square upon him, growling out:
"Whereabouts in your travels ma you
leave your manners and your senses?
I think you had better go back and try
to find them."
"What's the row, governor?" Rob
demanded innocently. The major ex
ploded: . .
"That's what I'd like to know.
There must be a row between you and
Jean Bascomâ last night you hardly
were civil to her, but went tagging
around after that Clayton creature."
"There's the Bascom temper â I'm
afraid it's , hereditaryâ besides. Elsie
Clayton says she would permit the
minister to leave obey in. the marriage
service," 'Rob began. -
His father cut him short. "If mat
ters have gone as far as that," he said,
"Just you listen -to .this. Unless you
marry to. Â«uit me you'll find that my
will ties up things as tight as that old
simpleton, Jimmy Jackson, tried to tie
up all he left " - â¢, Â¦-,..
"Why, I thought you disbelieved in
the will," Rob interrupted.
His 'father, turned redder than ever,
but went on, pounding the table hard
between words. "Yes, sir, .your/ wife
must please me; or you'll * have ' hard
sledding. Elsie Clayton, indeed! Look
at â¢ your ; mother, sir, and be properly
ashamed of your taste." Â¦ .
"I have nothing against Jean Bas
com," Rob began Judicially. "But she
is taken up with Ben Lloyd. Then, too,
she evidently takes her father's side-
Just as I have taken yoursâ â"
"You'll have an excellent Â¦ chance to
do it â if you say sweet things to Elsie
Clayton," Jean said. "But it's differ
ent with meâ I don't know a soul I
would dare to propose to â "Â¦
"I know several who are simply dy
ing for a chance to propose to you
though," Rob said gallantly, . playing
pigs-went-to-market with her fingers.
Aunt Mary tried to look scandalized,
but ended by laughing heartily. Jean
drew down the, corners of her mouth,
and pretended to sigh, asking: "Where
shall I find them, RobDy, dear? I am
simply pining to say 'Yes!' and
"Thanky* to somebody." >
"There's no time like the presentâ
and you have never accepted me out
right," Rob retorted. "But at Â¦ the
party you are to smile your sweetest
on Ben Lloydâ and Ben only. I know
lt'B pretty tough on himâ but he has
promised not to mind.- Seeing he
can't have you himself, he's ready to
do a man's part to help you get me."
Then the three fell â¢ talking all at'
once. It was late afternoon when
Rob went home, humming a love tune,
and smiling as he rode along.
The Hymes party turnec 1 out to be
far and away the grandest Hopewell
neighborhood had ever seen. . Notwith
standing, Major Hymes. got up the
morning after with a 'sense of aching

thing else." â¢
"I wish you couldn't do anything
else â may be then you wouldn't hold
your head bo high you never Bee me,"
somebody said through the open win
dow. It waa Rob Hymes, who had
been eavesdropping these last three
minutes. He went straight to Aunt
Mary, kissed her handsomely, and
patted her hand, then turned reproach
ful eyes on Jean.
"If you think mother and I mean
to be drawn into this absurd quarrel,
you clearly don't know the sort of folk
we are. The case is Just this â unless
you say you'll come, there won't be

"Why, Rob, I'd love to â but how

A WILL AND A WAY
"Ha!" In a moment he was there be
fore them, smiling and bowing, a span-
quick-action grooms spread out a bril
iiant carpet star; and two others, red
faced and with straining arms and
shoulders doubled over, brought on the
plaything of the giant.
When the day came for the final test
It waa the man who was unnerved and
pale. The girl to whom that day would
bring the glorious boon of sight or th,e
doom to hopeless darkness seemed en
dowed with a high, calm -courage, that
would have won the respect of a sol
dier.
When the eyes were free Bhe neither
moved nor spoke, \ noV gave a : sign of
any consciousness of . change. With
Jaws set close and hard, lest he betray
the awful â¢ fear that made him weak
and faint, Thornton adjusted the test
ing Instrumentâ a quick second of sick
ening suspenseâ then he laid it aside,
and for. a while neither spoke.
"I have failed. Miss Langdon," he
said at lastâ "failed."
His voice was quite calm, but it was
the calmness of despair. .
Still Thalia did not speak.
(Copyright, 1904, by Otho B. Senga.)
DR. THORNTON, a successful
specialist in serious ocular dis
eases, was puzzling over a most
unusual case in which he felt
baffled and dismayed. He wrote to the
celebrated oculist, Dr. Forrest, describ
ing the case, and asking for advice.
The learned doctor approved the
younger \ physician's diagnosis and
made many valuable suggestions, urg
ing a month's preliminary treatment to
prepare the nervous system for the
shock that would Inevitably follow.
His letter closed: "But my dear
Thornton, don't delude yourself or your
patient. After infancy there isn't one
chance in a million. Still, the fluid ap
plication, though painful, cannot harm
âand there may be a miracle. Success
would be a miracle, and you must pre
pare yourself and the patient for fail
ure." '
Thornton felt bound to read this to
Miss Langdon. She was ?3 or 24, and
had been blind since early childhood.
Her face paled, but she spoke brave
ly. "Even the millionth chance is
worth trying. Failure brings nothing
that I do not already know." < '. .
Miss Langdon and her young brother
Philip lived alone, except for the ser
vants, in the great, gloomy mansion on
the ancient Langdon estate, and dur
ing the month of "probation, as Tha
lia laughingly termed it, Thornton waa
a frequent caller.
From their first meeting Thornton
had felt the charm of Thalia's pres
ence. She had none of the pathetic
pensiveness that Is so often the accom
paniment of blindness. She was win-
Bomely bright and cheery, and her wit
was like flashing steel. â¢
After the necessary explanations
were made the approaching experiment
was not mentioned until the day came
for the first trial. The application of
the fluid used In the eyes was like
pouring hot oil Into an open wound,
but Thalia made no sound nor uttered
a word of protest.
As he bandaged the eyes Dr. Thorn
ton said pityingly, "This must be borne
twice more. Miss Langdon. Will your
courage hold out?"
"It will be as nothing if I can only
see," she whispered.
She was trembling violently, and
Thornton waa conscious of a sudden
tumult of emotions such aa he never
before had experienced. *
Before this he had. thought aolaly of
the fame he would win by success In a
case bo unusual. Now the thought of
what the girl must endure waa torture
to him, and worse than that waa the
wretched uncertainty of the result. She
was no longer a "case." She waa the
"one woman." He knew ltl
"When this la over." he resolved, "1
will tell herâ if I succeedâ"
When the bandages were removed a
week later and the eyes submitted to
the required test his heart sank, for he
saw there was no apparent change.
Thalia did not speak, but the unuttered
question of her eager face and tense
listening attitude struck a sharp pang
through his heart.
"You know," he said gently, "that I
can give you no assurance until I re
move the bandage after the third ap
plication."
fit is only two weeks more, she
sighed. "I can wait."
"Do not grieve bo," the sweet roleÂ©
said gently, "I do not mind so very
much. And no one need know that
you have failedâ no one need know
that you tried â "
"Don't, Thalia," ha cried hoarsely,
"you make me despise myself."
Then, at the sight of the pathetlo
figure, and the thought of the brave
spirit that strove to forget Its own
hurt and to comfort him, the- love he
had meant to offer with success rose
above the barrier of failure, and ho
came quickly to her side.
"Thalia." he whispered, "will you
let me take care of youâ always?
Will you be my wife, Thalia?"
Her Blight form trembled under the
tender touch of hla hand, but she did
not speak. Instead, she put her deli
cate, sensitive fingers up to his face,
and touched him gently on the eyes
and chin and mouth. Thornton knew
that she was readlne his face with her
fingers, as her eyes might have read
it had sight been given her, and he-,
held himself in firm control, fearing
he might frighten her with his agony
of love and longing.
The sweet flush faded from her face.
she pushed him gently from her, and.
turned away, saying coldly, "Tou ask
impossibilities. Doctor Thornton."
She called softly for Philip, and la
obedience to her Impassioned gsstxxre
her brother led bar from thÂ» room.
"It is all over, dear Philip," she said
In response to his anxious questioning.
"1 shall never see. Oh. don't. Philipâ I
don't mind. There are worse things
than blindness!" Â¦Â¦'/.:*
She sank wearily noon a couch. say-
Ing to herself bitterly, "I would rather
my eyes were blind than to be so blind
in the heart. Did he think a woman
would be content with pity?"
Philip turned Impetuously to the In
ner room. -He could not believe that
success had been withheld, that all
hope was gone. How could Dr. Thorn-,
tonâ but the hot reproaches of his
heart died upon his lips at the sight of
the doctor, sitting with bowed should
ers, his face buried in his hands. Great,
noiseless sobs shook his frame, but he
raised his head and tried to smile aa
he said. "Don't mind me, Philip; and
go away, plraae. You cannot under
stand."
But Philip did understand.
"You've killed him, Thalia," he cried
tragically, rushing to his sister's side.
"You might have known he couldn't
help loving you!"
"No. Philip," said Thalia, sadly, "he
only pities me because I am blind and
because he cannot help me."
"Go In there now, Thalia," pleaded
Philip, passionately, "and you will
know. He seems like a man who has
been stabbed, and to his death!"
His words and voice carried, convic
tion. Thalia rose.
"Will you take me back to him,
Philip?"
Thornton felt a gentle touch on his
shoulder, and ThaMa stood beside him.
her beautiful face transfigured with
love and gladness. The eyes of the soul
had been opened, even though physical
vision were still denied.
Â¦ "I thought It was because you pitied
me," she said softly.- "and I did not
want pity, I wantedâ" She stopped
and whispered a word in his ear. and
John Thornton took her In his arms,
with a heart too full for aught save si
lence.
He sank Into a chair, and taxed de
spairingly upon the exquisite face.
Was It fancy, a trick of his over
wrought nervesâ thla clear light of love
and tenderness that shone in the beau
tiful eyes and touched the tremulous
lips with gladness?
"Thalia," he cried, springing tÂ» his
feet, "you can see! You see me now.
Tell me that you do! I cannot be
lieve that you do not see my face as
your eyes meet mine!" â¢ .
The brave lips quivered, as she an
swered slowly and sadly, "No, Doctor
Thornton, I cannot see. It Is all Just
as it was beforeâ night, black night!"
Thornton groaned aloud.
"There is no hope then, now or
ever! I have failedâ I have failed!"
The utter hopelessness of his despair-
Ing cry bore to Thalia's heart a bitter
ness deeper than her own sorrow. She
rose from her seat as if she would go
to him.

DOCTOR THORNTON'S
FAILURE
But now it was number eight on tha
programme, and all eyes were focused
on the performers' entrance.
"Hercules, Hercules!" The excited
whisper gathered force and chased
along and up and down the tiers. Jaun
tily the manager advanced and made a
brief announcement. -Two blue-coated,
understand, I understand, Ma'amselle.
To-night you must answer 'Oul,' or he
will drop the dead-weight from his
teeth when you hang below!"
"Pierrot, Pierrot!" she cried, "I can
not, I will not perform to-night! See
seeâI tremble; I could not stand; I
could not ride Comanche Bill. I must
beg off. I am sick. Iâ I will tell the
manager!"
"Ma'amselle! No, no, Ma'amselle,
one moment, one moment!" cautioned
Pierrot, detaining her, and pressing his
hand against the crimson diamond on
his forehead.
"But Pierrot. Pierrot," she Insisted,
"I must, I must. Iâ!"
"Non, non, Ma'amselle, you must
not!" he whispered. "I have it, Pier
rot has it!" And again he glanced In
tently at the programme. "Blen, blen,
I have It! In number seven you ride
Comanche Bill. Hide him, Ma'am
sell. Pirouette! Jump.! Jump through
the drum; I hold it, Ma'amselle. Look,
number seven, 'Mirabeau on Coman
che.' Bah. beg off? Non, non. trust
Pierrot. Have no fear. You will not
swing from Hercules' weight!".
"But. Pierrot, how? How? You must
tell me!" n
Ting-tingâ ting-ting-tlng!
"Second bell, Ma'amselle," he In
terrupted, "second bell!" and grasping
the curtains he peeped through the
faded fringe. "Ah, the tiers, thev are
black with people, black, Ma'amselle!
There is no time, no time to tell..
Trust Pierrot, trust, trust!" And In a
moment he was gone.
Fifteen minutes later, with an angry
scowl Hercules, the dead-weight lifter,
raised the flap of the manager's tent
and entered.' "Sir," he announced,
"my weightâ m-my weight! It is "
stolen. Some prowlers, curse them!
T â the last moment, too!"
"Stolen, stolen!" repeated the man
ager In his highest key. "By heavens^
man, and we have 3000 unbelievers in
that tent all waiting to see your act.
"We've posted 1000 bills: we've adver
tised it for a month. We've â we've â
Hercules, what is to be done?" Â¦
"Well, sir," growled the champion,
darkly, "It ain't my fault, no, sir! But
there's one way out of it; one way, I
think."
"What way?" snapped the manager.
"It's â It's the papier mache " weight,
sir; li^ht as a feather. Iâ I used to
practice with it," 6tammered Hercules.
"But theyâ they wouldn't know It from
the real thing, sir; not on your life!
! Git two of the grooms, Dan'l and Pete,
sir; I know 'em well enough. They'll
perspire an* purtend a bit -when they
bring It on. Savez the idee, hey? I
reckon you do, sir; ha, ha!"
"Ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha!" laughed the
manager, heartily. "Splendid, Hercules,
splendid. I'll write to Barkalow. You
get a bonus for this â he, ha! And we
can stave off challenges for one night,
eh? To-morrow we'll invite inspection.
Very good, sir, v-very good, indeed!"
And bo it was arranged.
Came at 8 o'clock dinging and dying
amid railway siding sounds; and six
Items, like snow in a tropical sun, had
melted from Barkalow'a big wonder
list. Comanche Bill, pink-nosed and
piebald, with Mirabeau, was prancing
around the mammoth ring. "Whoop,
whoop, whoop, whoop-lah!-"' Crack!
Through ribbon ring after ribbon ring
the ma'amselle Jumped, landing always
fair, and dancing on her plush platform
saddle. Suddenly, "Whoop, whoop."
Swish! A tissue drum went into shreds
and Pierrot stepped down from his
pedestal and â¢ looked proudly at the
lady. "Hurrah, hurrah!" The audience
cheered and clapped their hands. "Well
done, well done!" and ma'amselie
bowed and*-dlmpled through her mask
of rouge.

JL white!" whispered Pierrot,
stepping noiselessly toward her on the
little sawdust circle before the per
formers' entrance.
On her downcast lashes he had
noticed a tear-diamond sparkling
bright as the rpangles on her short,
filmy skirt; and on her bosom, for a
moment, he watched the twisted sap
phire necklace glittering blue as it rose
and. fell in the blaze of light.
"Marie," he whispered again, "you
are In trouble, grave trouble, Ma'am-
Belle?"
"Oul, oui! I â I â am In trouble â
grave trouble. Pierrot," she an
swered, brokenly.
"Ah, Ma'amselle. and you know not
what io do; that is It?" he questioned
quickly, and Inviting confidence with
his earnest, searching little eyes.
"But, Marieâ Ma'amselle," he muttered,
stepping closer to her, so close that she
felt the warmth of his breath on her
cheek, "maybeâ maybe Pierrot might
knowâ Ifâ if you would tell him, hey?"
"Ah, Pierrot, non!" she faltered,
covering her face with her hands,
"youâ you could not, non, youâ youâ !"
No ether words would come. Her lips
Quivered; her eyes filled.
-Marie, Marie!" he urred, "maybe,
Xâ I ah, you think not, hey?" and his
broad breast swelled with a smothered
joveâ a love that had known no utter
ance; for he was "Pierrot, the fool," a
STOom! And she? She was "Ma'amselle
Mirabeau, premiere Equestrienne," In
Barkalow's big circus ring.
Suddenly, ting-ting, tlng-tlng-ting!
"Ma'amselle, Ma'amselle," he whis
pered warmlngly, "the first bell! Tou
hear? Thirty minutes, and you go on.
Just thirty. Marie!"
But still she did not answer.
"Ah. I am only Pierrot, Pierrot, the
fool," he murmured, "and youâ you
will not tell a fool. Ma'amselle. No,
no; why should you?"
"Pierrot!" From her tear-dimmed
eyes she dropped two email, pink star
fish hands and faced him. "Plarrot, 'a

and she shuddered violently. "Again,

"Number eight, Ma'amselle, number
eight on the programme, to-night's? I
have one Â¦omewhere," he mumbled,
searching doubtfully among the frilled
yards of rod, white and blue at his
pockets. "Ah," at last with trembling
fingers he unfolded the crushed, crim
eon sheet. "Hercules, Hercules. Hercu

"Mon Dieu, Mon Dieu!" muttered
Pierrot, when he had read the bill, "I
But the boy was first. In his tiny
hand he grasped the weight, and
hoisting it to his slender shoulder
sped with it like a startled hare across
the ring and out through the quiver
ing curtains.
"Ah, ha! Ha, ha, ha!" It was one
brief trickle of laughter accentuating
the Intense silence that followed; for.
In the thrill of a flute it all happened
and no one had attempted to stop him.
Hat. tat-tat!
"Now, all together!" commanded the
leader of the orchestra, coming gal
lantly to the rescue, and a bunch of
mandolins and violins ripped the air.
But music had no charms for the out
raged audience, and at last the storm
broke. Loud, long and deep-voiced It
raged; ribald laughter, shrill jeers,
dark threats and hisses like the angry
exhaust of steam.
"Gentlemen, gentlemen!"
In vain did the manager attempt to
Â¦tern the avalanche, but like a sick
man's whisper against a battery can
nonade his explanations and apologies

He stretched out his long, right arm;
his left, too, and the muscles of them
rose up like plaited whipcords. Then
he breathed, and every man breathed
with him. He broke a poker across his
thigh and the cheers rang wild and
deafening. He looked at the weight, at
the trapeze above, at Ma'amselle with
critical eye, and again the audience
cheered. If before they had doubted
the claims In number eight, it was evi

Mirabeau? White as chalk beneath,
her mask, she held her breath and
glared from her steed at Pierrot. And
Pierrot? Eyes bulging outward he
transfixed the little trapdoor In tha

Suddenly the giant stepped before the
weight and faced the high-priced seat*.
Above his head he raised his hands.
"Once, twice, thrice!" On the third call
he would swing and grasp and Juggle
with the dead weight as with a toy.

One of the Eastern critical magazines
has incorporated in its pages "The Edi
tor's'Clearlng-house," a department de-
I rt ed to the rapid consideration of
"specimens warious" from the literary
workshop. In these halcyon days of
the great gushing forth of spring and
summer fiction, much of It as evanes
cent and filmy as *a passing spring

i3 hard put to it to keep his head above
the flooa which pours In upon him.

one of his essays that the average
newspaper reviewer of books does away
with a pile of novels two feet high In

did book reviews, when he was on the

at least he will not be guilty of the

In his investigation. of the facts as

valued at $2500, a part of a very val

-West, who, was a close friend of
Beecher and â¢ had been principal of
a ladies' high school on the Brooklyn

nine years before,to be used for a cut

ordered < the â¢ coin returned and sup

been neglected and the matter had

The author's avowed purpose Is only
to attempt -to state clearly a problem
and to urge others/better qualified, to
the discovery. of its solution/ There are
many reasons given why the book
should have a claim upon our atten
tion, ami most of these might be con

psychical research, said: "It. is the

The Rjory of "The Widow's Mite" in
brief Is this: Dr. Funk, while prose-'
cuting in. a general way his Inquiries
into psychic phenomena, attended a
seance at the house of a medium In
whose honesty he felt perfect, confi
dence. The seances held at the house
of this medium were never for money,
but were family reunions of "the liv
ing and dead." Here the spirit control,
causing thÂ» woman medium's voice to
speak in the strongly, masculine tones
of the spirit 'who was using her, as she
lay in trance, for the mechanism by
which to put his thought in "matter
molded forms of speech,"- asked; Dr.

place an ancient coin called the
Widow's Mite, sayinc it was the re
quest of the spirit of â¢ Henry Ward
Beecher. Funk reolied that the coin
had been returned â - he then sup
posed it was. The answer from the
spirit world was that the coin had not
been returned, us. Dr. Funk supposed,

The old aphorism that "ridicule is
the test of truth" must have been in
the minds of Arthur Bartlett Maurice
and Frederick Taber Cooper when they
determined to throw upon the' record
of a hundred harried years of politics
the light of their "History of the Nine
teenth' Century in Caricature." For
if ridicule does indeed force truth to
put on the whole armor of light and
come forth to the fray no form of it

a book on the influence of caricature

The authors, recognizing Hogarth as
the father of English caricature and
the precursor of all the stalwart breed
of men whose pencils were to be couch
ed as lances, find the significance of
his satires upon life and manners with
out the province. of their work and
give to James Gillray,/ his successor
and imitator, the largest measure of
their attention, since it was Gillray who
first made the cartoon an element, of
strong political significance. Despite
the horrid conceits of this brutish fel-'
low, the reflection of his depravity and
insane Imaginings In his drawings, the
authors show that his flaming car;
toons,' directed against the . power . of
the Napoleonic regime, did much to fan
into white heat the wrath and antag
onism of England against' Bonaparte.
Strangely unlike the caricature of the
present day, which stings by wit, not
invective, Gillray's work summoned to
its aid every element of foulness and
loathsomeness that might make its
scurrility more enhanced.'

work, "Painters Since Leon

not eaousrh of the gauds and tinsel of
the typical book agent's no-home-com
plete-wjthout-one specimen of "refined
art work" is manifest between its cov
ers. But upon opening this compen
dium of notes aad criticism upon a
thousand acd more painters and their
treasures one cannot but feel that the
author has eet for himself a scope very
ak!n to that of the "History of the
World" or the "Heroes of All Ages,"
usually found occupying the plush tab
aret in Uncle Si's parlor up Woon
sockct wav.. Perhaps it is not for the
layman to decide whether or not Mr.
Pattlson has allowed vaulting ambi
tion to carry him away in the prepara
tion of this work; perhaps the layman
Is calculated to be a better judge than
the artist upon the pure question of
the taste exhibited by the author in
his endeavor to crowd the criticism of
several eras of artistic â¢ endeavor Into
the limits of a single volume. .
Accepting the simple preliminary
declaration of Pattison that "Here
will be found the artists since the time
cf Leonardo da Vinci, each set over
against the date when he was bom, so
that the picture of art as it is and has
been can be seen," we must look upon
his work, then, as a catalosue with
running criticism somewhat after the
order of marginal notes enlivening the
deadly dullness of name, date and
opera perfecta. This is no doubt of
value to the art student for ready ref
erence, just as the "Lives of the Poets"
or "American Bibliography" Is a quick
and ready friend of the student of lit
erature. But let no one conceive the
erroneous opinion that in this book
lies anything very illuminating on the
general subject of art tendencies, the
growth of schools or the effects of
changes of thought and of environment
upon the productions of successive
artists. That. Indeed, would be asking
too much of a history of painting from
the Renaissance to the present day in
one volume.
The author has elected fo follow the
painters according to strict chronolog
ical order. Irrespective of their Imme
diate associates, their school or the
country In â¢which they did or are do-
Ing their work. This effectually fixes
each painter In exactly the period of
yean which were Illumined by his
presence, but it gives rise to a fine con
fusion on the part of one who would
read the book from beginning to end.
At first off we are given a fcrlef re
sume of the contributions of Leonardo
to newly awakened art and then with
a transmontane Jump of no little se
verity we are next brought to the con
templation of the German Durer of
the Gothic school. Durer seems to
hold an especial significance for the
author; four pages are devoted to him
and but a scant two to Raphael. In
deed, Mr. Pattison finds himself forced
to mention only the obvious In the
case of all of the great masters, whose
works have been treated at length by
master critics of the past, in order that
he may devote the major portion of
his work to the expression of opinion
on subjects less harrowed over by
. other writers.
It Is then with the art of the later
eighteenth century that Pattison com
mences a fuller criticism and Indulges
in a more extensive survey of the tech
nique and style from tnat time to the
present day. Narrow-mindedness was
Hogarth's birthright, as the author
views the work of that father of cari
cature. Reynolds was admittedly a
painter of refined flesh tones, of pret
ty fancies, of superb color, but his
drawing was bad, and his touch was
purposeless and amateurish. Goya,
the Spanish colorist, who has been al
ternately lauded as a master and
damned as a depraved bungler, comes
' In for strong commendation at Patti
scn's hands. "The fascination of his
work is irresistible." (,
For leaders of the contemporaneous
schools, the author has some very out
spoken criticism. Jean Leon Gerome,
for years the famous master of. art
of the Paris ateliers, leads Pattison to
wonder if he was not "only a man of
superior talent who made 'articles de
Paris?* " Dante Gabrielle Rossetti ap
peals to the author chiefly as the In
ventor of along neck, "which mayor
may not be beautiful." His work was
"imitation pure and simple, scarcely
a spark of originality in It" Whistler,
the lately departed eccentric and ge
nius, is made the subject of quite the
most comprehensive study in the
book.
"Whistler Is another unaccountable
individual," says Pattison. "In a
measureless degree- a charlatan and
poseur, his stupendous ability disarms
criticism which would crush a smaller
man. Some events can be accounted
for. some almost* accounted for â
Whistler is a mystery."
. "This can be asserted of him," adds
the critic, "that he never has swerved

BOOKSTheir first stroke of luck occurred
when the hairdresser showing them
the "dropped three" fell down and tem
porarily stunned himself. It was not
kind of them, but they were desperate.
They fled for tha bank Just anyhow,
and scrambling over the grass gained
the restaurant. The officer overtaking
them at the door, led them to the table
that had been reserved for them, then
back to hunt for tha chaperon. The>
girls thought their trouble was over.
Had they glanced behind them their
Joy would have been shorter lived than
even was the case. The hairdresser
had recovered consciousness in time to
Bee them waddling over the grass. Ha
thought they were running to fetch
him brandy. When the officer returned
with the chaperon he found the hair
dresser sitting opposite to them explain
ing that ha reallv was not hurt and
suggested that, as they were there,
perhaps they would like something to
eat and drink. The girls made, ona
last frantic appeal to the man of buck
ram and. clay pipe, but the etiquette of
the Saxon army was inexorable. It
transpired that he might kill the hair
dresser, but nothing else; he must not
speak to himâ not even explain to the
poor devil why It was that he was be
ing killed. It did not seem quite .worth
It. They had some sandwiches and cof
fee at the hairdresser's expense and
went home In a cab, while the chap

Had ha been a commonplace German
hairdresser he 'would h&va understood
English and all might have been easy.
But to the classy German hairdresser
English Is not so necessary, and the
American Â¦ ladies had reached as re
gards their German only the "Improv
ing" stage. In her excitement sha eon
fused the subjunctive and tha Impera
tive and told him that ha "might" go.
But he had no wish to go. Ha assured
them, so they gathered, that his lntan
tlon was to devote the morning to their
service. Ha must have been a stupid
man. but- it Is a type occasionally en
countered. Two pretty women had
greeted bis advances with apparent de
light. They Were Americans, and tha
American girl was notoriously uncon
ventional. He knew himself to be a
good-looking young fellow. It did not
occur to him that in expressing willing
ness to dispense with his attendance
they could be in earnest. There was
nothing for It, so It seemed to the girls,
but to request the assistance of the of
ficer, who continued to skate round and
round them at a distance of about ten
yards.
So again the elder young lady, seiz
ing her opportunity, made appeal.- "I
cannot," explained the officer, who.
having been looking forward to a
morning with two of the prettiest girls
In Dresden, was also feeling mad; "I
dare not be seen speaking to a hair
dresser. You must get rid of him."
"But we can't." said the girL "We do
not know enough German, and ha can't
or he won't understand us. For good
ness sake come and help us. We'll be
spending the whole morning with him
if you don't" The German officer said
he was desolate. Steps would be taken
â later on m the week â the result of
which would probably be to render that
young hairdresser prematurely bald.
But meanwhile, beyond skating round
and round them, for which they did not
even feel they wanted to thank him,
the German officer could do nothing for
them. They tried being ruda to tha
hairdresser; he mistook it for Ameri
can chic. They tried Joining hands and
running away from him. but they were
not good skaters and he thought they
were trying to show him ths cakewalk.
They both fell down and hurt them
selves and It Is difficult to be angry
with a man, even a hairdresser, when
he is doing his best to pick you up and
comfort you. The chaperon was worse
than useless. She was very cold. She
had been promised her breakfast, but
saw no signs of It. She could not

how to get rid of him only bored her.
cant exactly fix him for the moment.'"
"You have met him possibly at Wles
man's In the Pragerstrasse: ha Is cna
of the attendants there." said the of
ficer. The American girl Is republican
In her Ideas, but she draws tha line at
hairdressers. In theory It Is absurd;
the hairdresser is a man and a brother;
but we are none of us logical all the
way. It made her mad the thought
that she bad been seen by all Dresden
society skating with a hairdresser.
"Well," she said. ."I do call that impu
dence. Why they wouldn't do that even
in Chicago." And she returned to where
the hairdresser was illustrating to her
friend tha Dutch Roll, determined to
explain to him, as politely as possible,
that although the free and enlightened
Westerner has abolished social distinc
tions he has not. yet abolished them
to that extent.
Even the American girl cannot, on
all occasions, sweep from her path the
cobwebs of old world etiquette. Two
American ladies told me a sad tale of
things that had happened to them not
long agx> In Dresden. An officer of rank
ar.d standing invited them to break
fast with him on the ice. Dames and
nobles of the plus haut ton would be
there. It is a social function that oc
curs ev<iry Sunday morning in Dres
den during the ekating season. The
treat lake in the Grosser Garten is
covered with all sorts and conditions
of people. Prince and commoner circle
ar.d recircle round one another. But
they do not mix. The girls were pleased.
They secured the servlc#s of an elderly
lady, the widow of an analytical chem
ist: unfortunately she could not skate.
They wrapped her up and put her in a
Elefige. "While they were in the garde
robe putting on their skates a German
gentleman came up and bowed to
them. He was a nice young man of
prepossessing appearance and amiable
manners. They could not call to mind
his name, but remembered having met
him â somewhere and on more than one
occasion. The American girl is always
sociable: they bowed and smiled and
saJd it was a fine day. He replied with
volubility, and helped them down on
the ice. He was really most attentive.
They eaw their friend, the officer of
noble family, and with the assistance
cf the German gentleman skated to
ward him. He plided past them. They
thought maybe he did not know enough
to stop, so they turned and skated
after him. They chased him three times
round the pond and then, feeling tired,
eased up and took counsel together.
"I am sure he must have seen us,"
paid the younger girl. "What does he
mean by it?" "Well, I have not come
down here to play forfeits," said the
other, "added to which I want my
breakfast. You wait here a minute,
I'll go and have It out with him." He
Â¦was standing only a dozen yards away.
Alone, though not a good performer
on the lee. she contrived to cover half
the distance dividing them. The of
ficer, perceiving her, with a pleasant
smile came to her assistance and
greeted her with effusion. "Oh," said
the ladv. who was feeling Indignant,
"I thought maybe you had left your

here, and. as a British ma
tron, reduced to slang by force of In

"You'd think the whole blessed show
belonged to her."
The European girl is hampered by her
relatives; she has to account for her
father; to explain away. If possible,
her grandfather. The American girl
sweeps them aside: "Dont you worry
about them," she says to the Lord
Chamberlain. "It's awfully good of
you. but don't you fuss yourself. I'm
looking after my old people. That's vay

Is lust to listen to what I am saying
and then hustle around. I can fill up
your time all right myself." Her father
may be a soap-boiler, her grandmother
may have gone out charring. "That's
all right." sh* says to her Embuttdor,
*1hÂ«y"re not coming. You Just take my
card and tell the King that when he's

her to admit that, taking her es a class,

In the eyes of the European man is
that she listens to him. I cannot say

covcr the expenses of the outing, while
last Thursday night a large body of
distinguished men of the West further
testified California's .appreciation of
the benefits, past, present and future,
conferred by Mr. McLaren's skill and
labor during the past seventeen years,
in a big banquet at the Palace HoteL
Among those honoring him were
representatives of the Chamber of
Commerce, the Board of Trade, the
Merchants' Association, the Merchants'
Exchange, the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association, the California
Promotion Committee, the California
State Board of Trade, the Board of
Park Commissioners and city officials.
Mr. McLaren will not only visit all
the principal parks of Europe and
America, for new Ideas in landscape
gardening, but he will bring back with
him puch seeds and plants as may
be suited to the conditions of the soil
and the climate here, thus adding, if
possible, to the already remarkable
varieties that have made Golden .Gate
Park one of the most famous pleasure
spots in the whole world.
For. since Mr. McLaren took charge
of the park seventeen years ago. It has
been brought to such a high state of
cultivation that it is now more a ques
tion of selection in the quality rather
than In the quantity of the vegetation,
and In thf laying out of that portion of
the park beyond Strawberry Hill the
Commissioners desire to be guided by
â¢what is new or novel or unique In
other quarters of the world. .
For instance, alter visiting Paris and
the march of progress, when a little
later <the Midwinter Fair began to
absorb the attention of the entire
West. :
. It was no small task to select this
site and to prepare it for the great Pa
cific exposition, -but now the park had
began Â¦ to' grow . at an amazing " rate,
for with the building of the exposition
there was realized also the construc
tion of Stow Lake and Strawberry
HI11, V with the. observatory at Its crest,
and Huntingdon Falls, splashing down
from the very entrance to tha observa
tory itself. - >\ Â¦
.The Midwinter Fair was perhaps the
biggest step .ever made in the matter
of : extending the park oceanward, for
after the exposition had closed and all
the buildings, with the exception of
the Japanese- garden and the museum,
had been i torn ' down and carted away,
the superintendent and the Park Com
missioners .were left with a .Vast ! tract
to bring ' from chaos into orderliness
and systematio beautificatlon.
The big. parade ground to the south
of ; the "; fair > proper â¢ lent Itself , so well
to the .sports, of; the Hour that Mr. Mc-
Laren recommended that It be. pre-/
served * as " 'the 'Â¦'-, present recreation
grounds.- with its baseball lawn and its
handball courts, â¢ which was done;; and
following . this ; the " grand court * of; the
fair itself, with "its /great oval basin,
surrounded - by broad driveways * and
footpaths and Its classic statuary, so
inevitably suggested itself as the best
place to establish a new music stand.
In place of the second, -which in turn
had outgrown its usefulness, that there
were no dissenting opinions.
But the work of selecting and pre-
paring the site of the Midwinter Fair
was as nothing to the task of reclaim
: ing it after the exposition had been
dismantled. The superintendent found
himself In the midst of the task of su
pervising: the construction -of thcavi
ary, the. building of the new $100,000
music stand donated by Claus Spreck
els on the site of the Administration
building' of the fair at the southwest
end of the grand court, the construe-'
tion of the big stone bridge on, the main
driveway i. to form ' a' tunnel "from Â¦ the
new music . site to - the cars of j the Mc-
Allister, the Geary and the Jackson
street / lines, at* almost one arid t the
same time while cultivating. the ground
left barren by the removal of the Fair
buildings, covering a wide area. But
all this was 'successfully; and expedl
tiously accomplished, .until now -this
spot ia one of the moat beautiful as
well as ; one of the most popular in the
entire park. > r
And ' in their â¢' turn there followed In
rapid succession . such improvements
and : additions ; as the â¢ deer glen, since
converted into the picturesque fern dell
leading from the tennis courts to the
bear pit; the buffalo paddock, the new
deer glen, the chain of lakes, the bi
cycle path to - the - beach, the ocean
boulevard, the picturesque ; and' power
ful . Dutch : windmill â¢ near the ocean it
self, the" boathouse- on' Stow Lake,
.with 'Its myriad fleet of rowboats sail
ing In the shadow of the Starr Kins;
Cross; the new Spreckels Lake for min
iature yacht races, the elaboration and
extension - of. the . grounds around the
Japanese tea garden, and now the re
clamation of all that territory between
Strawberry Hill and the ocean beneath
an- even two : feet of fertilizer to keep
quickly grew to Its .present popularity
and Importance, though Its: first hobby
horses were very wobbly In comparison
to the* gayly caparisoned steeds that
now pursue each other in a never-end
ing circle, while In place of the two
little donkeys and the Jaunting cart
that now drag the wee little tots along
the asphaltum driveway encircling the
island of patent wooden â¢ swings, bi
cycles were for hire to ride around the
same saucer-shaped track, but they
were never very popular even' when the
cycling craze was at its height.
And immediately after the comple
tion of the handsome stone building
and cafe at the grounds the little goat
teams and donkey rides around the
shrub-hidden lane were installed and'
have remained to this day one of the
most popular sports In tha whole park
among the - children. .
Simultaneously. there had been* built
the second music stand, the pearly
shell-shaped structure in the hollow
facing the Francis' Scott Key monu
ment, .which temple of muslo has but
recently, In turn, given place to tha
tennis courts, which will; no doubt, be
one I of the most lasting monuments to
Mr. McLaren's regime.
And while this second music stand
was * In the height : of V its glory the
rough hill to the northwest, which is
now connected with the tennis courts
by an Iron suspension bridge that
crosses the roadway connecting the
north and south driveways to., the
beach, was encircled with a little tor
tuous canal, down which boats -ware
floated every Sunday to the great de
light of the big crowds, old and young.
But that In turn had to give way to
One of the first things to be inaugu
rated was the children's playground,
which from a very modest beginning
At that time Golden Gate Park con
sisted of nothing more than the Pan
handle and a mere patch of lawn lying
between Stanyan street and the old mu
sic stand to the right of the present
main drive to the beach near the con
servatory and the conservatory itself.
All beyond that point-was little better
than a tangled waste of shrubbery, and
drifting sand. There was no children's
playground, no recreation grounds,
no aviary. In short, none of the splen
did features that have now made these
acres fronting on the Pacific one of the
greatest parks in the whole world. In
those seventeen - years, however, every,
foot of the ground comprised within the
Government grant has been gone over,
not once but many times, and even to
many constant residents in this city,
during all that time many of the. im
provements are still unknown or un
vlslted. In fact to give them mere cat
egorlal mention is to pile up a long list,
many of which were unthought of when
Mr. McLaren took charge.
Berlin and several of the other large
Continental cities, Mr. McLaren will go
to see the famous Florentine. Gardens,
which are among the most beautiful
in Europe and which. It Is thought, will
lend many good suggestions for the im
provement of the vast acres now being
reclaimed out near the beach, whfch
work In Itself calls attention to what
has been accomplished since the Com
missioners brought the Scotch gardener
from the old Howard place in San
Mateo in 1887 to undertake the task of
thoroughly reconstructing the park.
It is after leaving tha home of his
youth in Bannockburn that Mr. Mc-
Laren will turn his attention particu
larly to the plans for the cultivation of
this new territory, which is to be made
the most important in all the several
miles * of park -. ttiat ' lies .between the
new McKlnley . monument now being
erected at 'the entrance to the pan
handle and the new speed way, so- that
it can be readily^ appreciated how Im
portant and far-reaching 1j Mr. Mo-
Laren's present vacation trip abroad,

Bines he took charge. of tha manage
ment of tha Park In 1837 the force of
workmen and gardeners at his com
mand has grown from twenty to 330,
while under the new charter Mr. Mc-
Laren .â¢ not only â¢ has the supervision
of Golden Gate Park but of all the
smaller' parks and plats surrounding

so It can be seen what a big task now
devolves upon him..
.But already the smaller. parks and tha
grounds surrounding the public build
ings, particularly the City Hall and the
City and County Hospital, as, well as
Union Square, give pleasing evidence
of his. masterful care and â¢skill. .
Indeed It is In the finer art of garden
ing that -Mr. McLaren. has shown his
superiority. In all the improvements in
Golden Gate Park. he has tried to copy
nature herself. ' There Is nothing set
or stiff or stilted' In his arrangement
the sand in place, and tha prospective
construction of tha proposed new speed

Those who can recall the ruffled
belles of 1860. and of the years fol

of those days was all that grace and
beauty could make her; and they will

Of course there is no need trying to
tell you that this airy floating creature
of 1904, this war time girl, is the most
admirable girl of recent years, for she
, is nothing of the sort. Her . gowns
are far too long and . far \ too "thin ' to
be adrrlrabie, and she is not 'hygienic
in her style of .dress. She wears too
many floating ribbons. She / is too

This, by the way, Is a very popular
trimming. The band of lace ' running
around the skirt and tne band of black
velvet bordering it top and bottom is
very.chlc. '.Every old-fashioned dress
maker will tell 5 you how .it Is" done.
You sew the lace flat to the skirt, run

never in the 1860 days was there as
much spent upon gowns as now.
The revival of the wartime girl
brings In at once the fun skirt. This
Ekirt can be cut in one of three or four
ways. It can be a straight gored af
fair, made by cutting so. many lengths
off a piece of goods and sewing them
together, or it can be a skirt some
what sloped toward the belt line, or It
can be a skirt that is laid in Bide plaits
all the way around the hips.
In any case, it is shirred or tucked,
gathered or, in one way or another,
brought In to serve the purpose of
making the hips trim. .
The women of 1860 dla not think it
In good taste to outline the hips so
sharply and the gowns were gathered
upon the belt. II they were made of
thin wash goods, the .gathers were
"scratched" Â¦ to make them lie evenly
in place.
But the modern wartime girl will not
consent to lose her most desirable
point, namely, her hip line, so she has
her skirt laid in side plaits, or tucked,
or gathered, and, while doing this, Ehe
surreptitiously throws a little of the
fullness toward -the back. It is more
becoming so.Â» The skirt Is a full skirt,
but there Is Just a little more fullness
In the back than in tne rrontâ though
not much. \
In only one thing is the wartime girl
of 1904 absolutely true to the wartime
girl of 1860, and this is in the matter of
length of skirt. The I860 girl .would
as soon have cut off her own daintily
Bhod feet as go out witn a short skirt.
And so It Is with the wartime girl of
1904. Her skirt must be long, or, if not
long, it must be what is known as a
round length. . Â¦' - Â¦ '
The round length, as generally ac
cepted. Is the skirt which just touches
the floor. Maybe it a little more than
touches. It is precisely the same length
front and back and all the way around.
The round length usually lies upon the
floor an Inch when one . is standing
BtilL But in walking, It escapes pret
tily, though it requires holding up in
the street.
There Is. of course, the pedestrian
skirt and the walking skirt, the trot
ting skirt, the Instep length and j the
skirt which escapes and discloses .the
feet. But this Â«klrt Is of a different
brand and Is bred of a different fashion.
It has nothing to do with , the war time
Etyles of 1904. "It is in every ward
robe, but it is not the keynote to the
fashions by any means. The day has
gone by when the trotting skirt ruled
the fashions. Â» .
The trimming of the 1860 skirt Is
not always the < same. The skirts of
forty years ago were ruffled with two
deep ruffles, with a piping or shirring
or a band of lace above c the ruffles.
But in these revival days a greater
variety is allowed. There is a strong
resemblance to these 1860 trimmings,
yet there is a difference. Ruffles are
not actually obligatory, though It is
a wise woman who wears; them if she
can.: -SffiWE .-*'.. -'â¢. Â¦'
Ruffles are by far the most attract
ive 'and the most effective trimming of
the summer. They are light and float-
Ing and they give the gown an air of
grace which it can get in no other
way. " Ruffles of the same material,
can be tied with It and your waist can
have a few rows of it, laid in between
the rows of shirring, or laid along the
rows of tucks.
Narrow velvet is one of the revival
trimmings. It is used a great deal
and usually in connection with lace,
though there are gowns that are
trimmed- with row after row of the
velvet, all put on by hand and sewed
along the upper edge. The lower edge
Is left free, as it is found that the
Velvet sets better when it is not sewed
tightly along both edges.
There is a trimming which is much in
favor. with the 1SG0 girl and this, too,
is a revival trimming. -. Everybody re
members the days ! when ribbon was
box plaited ' and stitched along the
middle. This trimming was used to
trim skirts and waists and even to
trim silk coats. Well, it Is this same
box plaited ribbon which Is In style
again and it is used Just as it used to
be. above a band of lace or above a
ruffle.
Very many of the new skirts have
a wide box plaiting around the foot,
perhaps eight inches wide. Then
comes a band of lace and then a nar
row box plaiting stitched through the
middle.
In the materials there is a great deal
to be said, for they, too, are to a great
extent the materials which were worn
forty years ago. Many of them mas
querade under new and fancy names,
yet in them will be recognized all the
old favorrtes.
Grenadine is to be a great deal worn
as a summer material and It will be
prettily figured and trimmed with
bands of taffeta or with bands of vel
vet and of lace. Or there will be ruf
fles of grenadine set around the foot
of the gown and these will be light,
fluffy ruffles calculated to bestow a
witching grace upon the young woman
who wears them.
Poplin is lovelier than ever this year
and, whether one chooses poplin, 81
cilienne or mohair. It is all the same
as far as the gloss Is concerned. And
even so with brilllantine, which now
comes of exquisite luster even in the
cheaper grades.
The discovery of the process of mer
cerizing goods has added greatly to
the number of lustrous fabrics and It
Is possible now to obtain a very bril
liant material . for only a fraction of
what such a gown cost forty Â¦ years
ago. In those days poplin was poplin
and it was % never cheap.
Satin, too-, Is In style, and there are
satins in the old .ashes-of-roses . shade
and In the curious shade called London
smoke. There was a time when ashes
of-roses, London smoke, elephant's
breath and Irish poplin gray were the
shades of the season. And they come
mighty near ' being the . shades of Â¦ the
present year. You would be amazed
to â¢ note bow . many fashionable recep
tion and calling gowns and nice gowns
for church and other occasions are con
structed , of >material In these colors.
So In the new -.materials one finds
the old stuffs and' she who has pre
served a cow n of the Ions ago can
bring it out and run a good chance of
finding It In vogue,. not only In general
characteristics," but in color and ma
terial as well. They even combine

this elrl of 1860. And they study her
wardrobe to see how closely she has
adhered to the styles of the' Lincoln
days, the lovely fashions before the
war. â¢ .
Those who have studied the fashions
of the past century will tell you that
there was a time when the styles were
exquisite. This was during the ten
years which exactly preceded the Civil
War. From 1850 to 1860 American
womanhood had a wonderful fashion
era and the styles which were created
then were too beautiful ever to go en
tirely out of memory.
Get out your old photograph albums
and turn the leaves to" where mother
or grandmother stood forth In her best
gown to be "taken." There were no
Instantaneous photographs in those
days, and the result was that each
picture was posed with exceeding care.
The gown was smoothed until it had
not wrinkle nor fold, and the fair sitter
obtained a portrait which was a correct
likeness, not only of herself, but of her
gewn as well. ;
And these are -the fashions which are
the vogue to-day.. These are the styles
which are being worn and will continue
to be worn the following summer. On
the board walk you will eee the 1EU0
girl and you will find her in the draw
ing-room and in the ballroom.
All the best modistes are studying
the 1S60 girl, and all the best designers
of London and Paris are ' paving the
way for her to come and make a long
etay.
' This girl, who deserves the. name of
the wartime girl, has a style that Is
quite her own. It is distinct and in
many respects creative. It is different
from any other style and It Is a style
Â¦which belongs to her exclusively from
the crown of her head to the tip of her
toe. You cannot mix her up with the
1830 girl. She is' too prettily feminine,
too trim. tt>o perfect.
The 1830 girl, it must be remarked, is
all right. She Is dainty and pretty,
but ehe Is a bit extreme. She came in
a year ago and flounced her queerly
cut gown before you. But she. could
not make herself quite popular. She
was not distinctive. You were never
sure whether Ehe was an 1830 girl or of
the Josephine era. The styles of 1830
were too mixed. They were composed
of the styles of all the other fashion
epochs, grouped and bunched. And the
effect was not good enough to be last-
Ing. -
And this is what paved the way for
the wartime girl, the girl of I860.'
Over In Paris this girl has quite
taken the Paris world by storm. Pa
quln has studied her and Is delighted.
"I am adopting the Btyles of the Con
federacy," he says, "and I am every
day finding In them more and more
that Is beautiful." . :- V;
The Southern women of the 1860 days
Â¦were wonderfullv well gowned^ -They
were famous then, and were quoted In
Paris, and they were also renowned In
their own land. No great social-func
tion was complete unless a Southern
belle could be coaxed from Old Vir
ginia to grace the occasion.
And now It is the revival of the
Southern girl,- a revival of the gowns
of the Confederacy, a revival "of the
dresses that were worn In the 1860
days.
This period also brings In the Eu
genie gowns, for; the ex-Empress was
very much alive and I very > dressy in
that period. " But the Empress Eugenie
was Just the least trifle extreme, -her
gowns were too extravagant and ' hen
fashions, a little too marvelous to be
come popular. Â¦ Women v c6uld riot af
ford them. And those who could -afford
them were not always willing- to dress
a la mode. ' " ' â¢ --
But with the gowns ' of Â¦ the Confed
eracy It was different. They .were ut
terly charming. And they were not so
very extravagant, either. Though the
Southern women * of those days were
wealthy, they were economical ' and
tints. , Just as they once did, and you
seÂ« pink and gray and blue and gray
and red and blue and pink and blue
and all the old time combinations en*
Joying: as great a popularity as they
ever had In the Ion? ago.
But particularly In the necks of
gowns does one note the revival re
semblances. The new necks are cut
to a point and are either filled In with
a chemisette or left open and slightly
tapering down to a point. Both ways
are good.
For day wear the woman of the
present day does not go In for the low
neck. And so, during the day. she ad-
Justs a high-neck bertha In her gowns.
Or she puts on a chemisette with a
high stock. Or she may wear one of
those arrangements which have a high
neck and long, full puffed sleeves, but
which are nqt finished off around the
belt line. There are many ways of
filling In a low neck. Or, If her neck
be very pretty, she will have her gown
made with a slightly pointed effect and
will wear It that way.
But for evening the woman of the
times likes to have her neck pointed
and rather low. Ehe likes to cut the
neck of her gown down to a V In the
middle of the front and a V in the
back. And then she finishes It In a
new way. She takes deep lace ana
gathers It and sews It around the neck
of her gown.
The girl who does not understand the
art of shirring a piece of lace In her
neck should get busy at once. She must
learn how to take It and turn over the
edge and how to run a stout shirr
string In the doubled-over edge. This
makes a full heading for the lace.
The prettiest lace necks are trimmed
with lace which comes down In points,
a long point and a short one, with a
string running through the heading.
This lace Is then sewed around tha
neck, which takes a very pretty shape.
Right In the middle of the front the
points of lace should be arranged to
hang down to the belt line.
And there Is the very old-fashioned
way of running a piece of lace with
ribbons and setting it around the neck
of the gown. There can be three or
four rows of the ribbon, and the ends
are then tied In pretty little bows right
In the middle of the front.
It will be noted from a study of the
fashions that they are extremely fem
inine. There is nothing severe about
them, and the woman who needs little
softening touchesâ and most women
do â can easily find them In the gowns
of the summer.
Now, in mentioning the fashionable
features, one must not neglect to say
that there will be a revival of the poi
onaise. Indeed, it is already pretty
well revived, for one sees many a gown
trimmed so that one cannot tell
whether there Is a tunic or not.
whether there Is a semi-skirt or only
one skirt, nor whether there !s a pol
onaise or merely a simulated over
dress. When such Is the case, then It
Is not out of the way to. predict that
the overskirt and the polonaise are not
far off. . 'Â¦'â¢ 'â¢ â¢ "fiÂ«
But in one way the wartime girl of
1904 rebels from the Ideas of her pre
decessor, the wartime girl of 1860. And
this Is In the hoop-skirt: for the war
time girl of to-day absolutely refuses
to don such an article. "I take that
which 13 comfortable and practical,"
she says. "But I discard that which
is disfiguring and that which Is un
comfortable." . , , .
The girl of to-day stiffens her skirts
with silk linings and. under the dress
skirt, she wears petticoats of silk with
many ruffles upon them. She also
wears a drop silk lining, for many of
the Bklrts are both lined and furnished
with a silk drop skirt. -
But it is upon her marvelous siik pet
ticoat that the girl of the period relies.
This is long and Is trimmed with a ruf
fle which will make any dress stand
out and which answers all the pur
poses of a hoop skirt, without its ag
gressiveness. The silk skirt gives the
comfortable rustle and is prettier far
than the old hoop of bones and steeL
There Is no sign that the bustle will
return, but this was a feature of later
daysâ not of I860. The bustle was
much more fashionable In 1S70 than in
1860, while in 1830 there was no gowa
worn without Its bustle.

THE WAR TIME GIRL OF 1904ABOUT TIGHT CLOTHING (Mrs.
T. N. J.)â The woman who is healthy
and happy,' and the terms are synony
mous, does not wear her clothing un
comfortably tight. She has grown
wiser. Women's clothing is cumber
some enough at best, but when vanity
and a mistaken sense of style prompt
the wearing of tight shoes which dis
tort the feet, high collars which be
get throat troubles and cause the face
to flush and darken and tight corsets
and bands which force ugly lines about
the hips and bust, then the woman of
civilization Is but a step removed from
the women of China who hobble on
maimed feet. Many women have an
idea that comfort and untidy loose
ness of attire, coupled with lack of
style, go hand in hand and are vic
tims of "nerves" in consequence. How
this wrong idea still obtains I can
not Imagine, in view of the fict that
perfect cut and fit has made the loose
outer garment and shirt waist artistic
and a pronounced success for years
past. If all women would apply this
knowledge in the selection or making
of other garments all might be as com
fortable as men who scorn a garment
if it pinches. I do not advocate any
of in? monstrosities of dress which
have masqueraded under the name of
health garments, but I do Insist that if
the corset is properly fitted and loose
enough for perfect comfort, and shoes,
belts, etc., fitted on the same principle,
woman's health would be much better
than it is. So long as women wear
compressing clothing just so long will
suffering from numerous mental and
physical ills result. An hour a day
spent In exercise will not undo the
work of ten or twelve hours of im
proper living, hence the absurdity of
women's trying to obtain better health
by exercise and gymnastics when they
go from such exercise directly Into thÂ»
vices of ti^ht fitjed clothes.
STAINS FROM GASOLINE (A. B.
C.) â I fear you cannot entirely eradi
cate the stain left around the spot
cleaned with gasoline. However. If the
ppot is very prominent It may be ren
dered less conspicuous by the following
method, unless the gasoline has caused
the color of the fabric to smirch, as is
sometimes the case when the color is
not absolutely fast. To one pint of
tepid water add fifteen drops of best
household ammonia. Stretch the
stained portion firmly into a large em
broidery hoop, have plenty of clean
white cloths handy, and with a small
wad of the fabric like the garment
moistened, but not too wet. go over thÂ»
stain rapidly and then rub dry with a
clean, dry white cloth, changing this
cloth as soon as it is slightly soiled. A
new- tooth brush with soft bristles,
moistened with the ammoniated water,
is very helpful in reaching into the
warp of the stained fabric and is to bo
preferred to a wad of the goods. Use
the brush lightly to prevent "fuzzing"
the fabric. By holding a sheet of clean
white blotting paper under the stain
the moisture i3 rapidly absorbed and a
further stain guarded against. If you
prefer, you may rub French chalk free
ly over the stain and allow It to remain
on for several hours; then brush off.
Grease Is readily absorbed by this sub
stance and it may not be necessary to
moisten the fabric. â¢
in. As a preliminary for the absorp
tion of the skin food bathe the breasts
with warm water and dry gently with
a soft towel, then anoint with a lib
eral coating of the skin food. The
massage is most essential, hencs
should not be done In a careless or
hasty manner. Place ths finger tips
under the arm and bring forward to
the center of tise bust, then above.
bringing the fingers downward, from
underneath upward and always to tha
center of the bust, until the entire sur
face is gone over several times. Then
begin in a rotary movement around
the left breast, bringing the movement
gradually to the center; continue the
manipulation for ten or fifteen min
utes, then treat the right breast in a
like manner.' Throughout the move
ment use plenty of the skin food, for
it will hasten the filling out of the
shrunken tissues and the exercise will
send the blood bounding briskly
through the veins, which alone means
new life and vigor. In the morning;
bathe the bust with cold water to give
tone 'and firmness to the muscles; dry
thoroughly, keeping up a rotary move
ment. A decided improvement should
be noticed at the end of a month if
you are faithful in the treatment as
directed.
SHIRT WAIST FASTENINGS (B.
T. L.).â There Is such a variety of fash
ionable fastenings for the shirt waist
this season that a woman is whimsical
Indeed who cannot find something to
her liking. Of course there Is the ever
popular pearl button varying from tTie
tiniest ball to the flat' coin shape as
large as a silver half dollar. Ths me
dium, dime size. Is most practical, al
though the larger sizes are extremely
smart on waists of heavy linen. Then
there are the pearl â¢ and metal sets,
which' are attached to the waist, by
means of a pin at the back, and need
only be detached v.hen the waist is
cleaned, and then their removal is a
decided advantage. enabling the
laundress to Iron the center boxplait
and cuffs more perfectly than can be
done when buttons are permanently
attached. The small, slightly oblong
bar pin, about an Inch in length, which
was quite the rage several seasons ago.
has been revived and Is shown in both
gold and silver. The most dainty ones
have a plain frosted " surf ace set with
a single pearl, colored gem or the love
liest bit of colored enamel. The fancy
for hand-painted porcelain buttons of
immense size is a fad among well
dressed and. fortunate is the
; woman Vbo_can paint them herself,
for the prices asked for them In the
shops is so high as to preclude them
from becoming common. A novelty of
the season' Is the set of. studs, oval or
round; a half inch in diameter, with
belt.Mickle to match, which Is made of
gun metal or silver set with a rather
large opalescent center; these buckles
are from one and one-half to two Inches
in diameter^ Waists of every class of
materialare^made up with the Dutch
or blind closing, gtillefess of any visible
fastenings, ' for. those who prefer less
display ' than provided by the orna
mental; fastenings mentioned-
be more popular than ever for veranda,
pick-up work. The possibilities of the
material are. better understood, designs
have gained in dignity of form and
purpose' until now really beautiful re
sults are obtainable, suitable for al
most any room and particularly har
monious among summer furnishings.
Â¦ CARE OF TENDER GUMS (Ma
rie).- â Your trouble is probably due
to a . harsh . toothbrush and dentifrice
and you have also rather overdone
the cleaning. Three vigorous brush
ings daily is too much, especially
when a very, stiff brush is Used. The
gums are kept in a constant state of
irritation by this method and instead
of preventing dentist's bills it will
Increase them, as the loose fillings
and tender gums indicate. To relieve
the â¢sore gums obtain "one ounce of
tincture of capsicum and apply to all
the tender spots with a soft camel's
hair . brush. Be very particular . to go
around the edges of the gums which
show a tendency to -recede from "the
teeth. For a few days, until the sore
ness is relieved, clean the teeth by
washing with a bit of absorbent cot
ton wound on the end of an orange
wood stick, first dipping it into warm
water and then into plain precipitated
chalk. Rinse the mouth, then use
dental floss to remove all particles
from between the teeth and rinse
thoroughly again. Discard your stiff
toothbrush and substitute one with
soft, fine bristles. Have the fotlow
ing reliable tooth powder prepared by
your druggist: One-half ounce of or
ris root, one-fourth ounce of powder
ed white castlle soap, one ounce of
precipitated chalk" and one-fourth
ounce of cassia powder. Use this
twice a clay, at morning and at night,
before retiring. .

BLEACHâ Fair Hair. Bleaching Is
always .a failure where one is an ab
ject slave, \ and . even j then it is most
difficult to keep the world from know
ing it. Peroxide in itself is not Inju
rious, but the Â¦ ammonia that is used
with it makes the hair brittle and grad
ually kills the roots. Soda is about ua
harmful and you will find that after
you have ysed-lta" few months your
hair will come out at an alarming rate.
However, there i is a remedy that you
may try- and it is a Â¦, very simple one
as . well. Squeeze the juice . of three
lemons in the rinsing water and wash
the head thoroughly. 'Be careful, how
ever, that. the ends of the hair do not
get' into- this water, for the contrast

would in all probability seem six or
seven shades lighter.

OIL BATH FOR CONVALESCENTS
(Dorothy).- â After a severe illness,
when the body responds slowly tSo
nourishment, oil baths are invaluable
in supplying "the needful fat to the
skin and underlying tissues. If the
baths can be given by a professional,
so much the better," for the thorough
massage which always accompanies
such applications will stimulate, .the
entire system. If the professional is
not available one can take an oil bath
one's self and it will prove very benefi
cial. Too many make. the mistake of
overworking the stomach when the
nourishment baths should assist in the
work of restoration. The best grade
of olive oil may be used for. the bath,
although professionals generally use
cocoa butter. Three oil rubs may be
taken each week, provided the oil or
butter is well rubbed in. The body
should I be perfectly dry and almost
free from the oil when the rubbing, is
completed. ! Before the application use
a cleansing bath of warm water and
soap, followed by a tonic bath of tepid
salt water, then the cleansed pores will
greedily drink in the oil. -Just before
retiring is the best time for such treat
ment, for the fatigue which the exer
tion brings is quickly forgotten in re
freshing, sleep. While the oil should
be applied to the entire body, the
trunk should receive the most thor
ough manipulation and the largest
quantity of oil. I cannot give the
exact quantity of oil to be used each
time, because of â¢ the difference in in
dividual 'needs, but the general rule
is to use all. the skin will absorb. "

So, girls. If you're thinking of. riding
this summer, try the double. bow first,
for it is warranted to ', prove more Im
pertinent, more alluring and mpre cap
tivating. .
There is but one other fashion that
horseback riders thoroughly approve of
and that Is the double Dutch braid.
The hair Is rolled on the sides or rip
ples softly back just as she pleases, but
all is fastened in a snug braid that is
fashioned -lengthwise of the head. .If
the elastic is used,. It will stay-4n placa
splendidly, but it has a most disagree
able fashion of slipping, down unless
held firmly in Its place.
Occasionally a black satin ribbon is
substituted for the rubber and it is not
only useful but is pretty as well, for
the fluffy bow takes away some of that
stiff look that seems to be a part of
the mannish Derby. . If, for any .untold
reason, she wishes to look particularly
captivating, she fastens ' another' bow
a few inches above the bottom of her
braid, and the ribbon entirely, tikes
the place of ' hairpins and sidecombs
and has a decidedly pleasing effect at
the same time. 7.1'*'* ??,->'
likewise warm, and another considera
tion that was a good 6lzed item to the
average horsewoman , was their price
and the rate at which they cracked and
were relegated to the old clothes pile.
In selecting her hat Miladi has- a
choice between twoâ the Derby and the
sailorâ but really they are as differen'
as day is from night and should be
worn when the season is apropos. Â¦Â¦
For country wear the corduroy suits
are what has taken her eye, for they
do not show the dust and wear until
the fourth or fifth generation. In fact;
if she hunted for a month of Sundays
she could not find anything more ser
viceable or more nifty looking. With
this suit she pulls a rough rider over
her eyes, digs her russet-colored boots
Into her horse's sides and races along
enjoying life to the. utmost. .
But whatever her costume or wher
ever her destination, the style of dress
ing her hair varies but little, j For in
stance, the horsewoman considers it
bad form to pile her hair on top of
her head and run hatpins through t a
smart looking Derby. First, last and
always, she must wear her hair dressed
low. And this she does in the simplest,
easiest fashion.
If she chances to be the fortunate
possessor of quantities of hair she fre
quently parts it in the middle, rolls
either side back prettily and softly
over her cars and then catches it into
the braid. Round and round she twists
It. holding the coils firmly with one
hand, and putting long bone hairpins
where they will do, the best work, for
riding against the wind with an elastic
tugging and pulling every minute of the
way sheds pins at a fast and 'furious
rate and is decidedly uncomfortable
and untidy appearing in the bargain.
The "bun" : is another style of low
dressing that J3 popular and/ fetching.-
The hair is tied half way to the crown
of the head, then brought over the bit
of string that holds it and is coiled
about and fastened firmly in place.
And, by the way. Miss Equestrienne
has a brand new wrinkle and one that
delights her very soul. Pieces of string
or tape are % a decided nusance and are
always difficult to cover neatly. When
she brought it into position to tie it
snugly she never failed to catch a stray
hair or two. and if she refused to
stand their pulling all during her ride,
she was obliged to take it down and
do it all over again. But now she
has one the best of Mr. Hair. A small
elastic, heavy and strong, answers in
stead of the string, and when she brings
her hair to the desired point, she twists
the elastic quickly about, fastens the
two ends firmly together with a wire
hairpin and there she is as snug as a
bug in a rug.
This trick has another advantage, too.
Tapes and strongs are always difficult
to remove. It is hard to unfasten them
and when they are slipped off they pull
out a dozen or more hairs and create a
decided disturbance. " But" with the
elastic a single, turn of the wrist ac
complishes all. When the hairpin is
removed the two ends fall apart and
the hair falls down the back without
more ado. .

the younger Miss Rodman. He took
her to the Casino, dances and sent her
endless supplies of candy and flow

There are many other curious things
which must be seen to be appreciated.
Colonel Dye says that he has done all
this from. time to time to make himself

ALFRED DEZENDORF.
In order to give the proper weight to
this sober study of applied sociology It
will be necessary to cite a few lurid In
stances from the* career of our friend,
William Henry Blnks. When Blnks
was considerably younger than he Is
now, and before the flight of time had
rubbed the once luxuriant herbage
from the corners of his forehead and
marked that same forehead with vari
ous and sundry longitudinal dimples,
he had been considerable of a rounder.
It Bill's thirst wasn't quenched It
THE old saying has It that the
child is father to the man. but to
that sage remark, as we shall at
tempt to illustrate In our poor,
weak way, should be added the other
proverb that it Is a wise child that is
able to recognize its own father. Those
-who are aware of. the extremely small
percentage of wisdom at large among
the human race will realize the pitiful
condition of ignorance to which most of
us are reduced. If the average man at
the age of 50 years could see himself at
the age of 20 he would probably swear
out a' warrant for his own arrest on the
ground of being a suspicious character
or a vagrant without visible means of
support.
record of. The only horse that a man
can really bet on with safety is a saw
horse and Eill didn't hanker to learn
anything about that particular varie
ty.
Bill's father had early tried to Im
press upon that modern edition of the
prodigal eon the importance of ac
quiring large bunches of knowledge
so that he should start square with
the boys who bad had the advantage of
being born on Indiana farms and pull-
Ing sassafras roots for a living In their
indigent youth. But Bill didn't seem
to bÂ« particularly impressed with the
desirability of starting early. Any
thing that was to be pulled off early
aroused his displeasure unless he
could stay up all night to see It. Even
the early bird story was wasted on
him for the reason that ha believed
that the bird who stayed out all night
could gather us a pocketful of worms
on the way home and score a point
on the poor bird who had to shave
and dress and run for his train be
fore he could get to where the worms
hung out.
When the proposition was put up to
Bill that a college diploma would bÂ«
a good thing to hang on the wall of
his office he docked and countered with
the argument that If he lingered In the
classic halls of learning the amount of
time required to land the sheepskin,
the offices would all be rented. Be
sides, he Inquired, who was going to re
imburse him for the good times that h*
hadn't had while he waa adding to tha
Incomes of the stockholders In thÂ» Mid
night Oil Company. So hs sidestepped
and let the college course go by. The
next Idea that waa handed out to him
by the parental hand was that hs
should go Into business. That wasn't
quite so bad. because business doesn't
entirely Interfere with the Important
pursuits of life, but Bill had his doubts
about the propriety of tying a young
and high spirited colt down to hard
labor when he was Just off the grass.
The only thing that seemed left for
Bill was the House of Correction, when
he accidentally crossed the trail of a
fair, young, gentle thing with a male
parent who had so much money that
he spent most of his time going around
looking for places to lose it Bill de
cided at once that he knew an alley
where the old man could drop a bas
ketful of it any dark night. When he
made the proposition to the young
lady she admitted that there seemed
to be something In it, inasmuch as Bill
was not without certain qualities that
are supposed to appeal to the fem
inine heart. He could wear his clothes
as though they had not been worn by
more than one person before he came
Into them and he could walk Into a
room Inhabited principally by beings
of the opposite sex without falling
over a chair or getting mixed up with
the rug. These are qualities so rare
among .the common or garden Ameri
can male that Bill was a marked man
for that reason.
It Is useless to make a short story
Through the open windows came the
dreamy notes of a waltz. Hicks leaned
toward the girl and took one of her
hands In his. In the moonlight he saw
the tell-tale color creep Into her cheeks.
"You haven't any idea what your in
struction has come to mean to me."
he said. "But now that I have learned
what it means, I can't live without it.
You must instruct me through life. I
shan't say will you marry me, but you
must marry me. Betty."
She started, then :Â«ug/hed softly.
"Oh, yes, of course, the proposal,"
she said lightly. "I've n6 criticism to
make; It's very well done. Only you
must remember at the really critical
time that my sister's name Is Nan.
not Betty." v
"This is the critical time." said he
gravely, "and you know I'm not re
hearsing. I've not given Nan a
thought since that first ride of ours.
I've been in earnest, terribly in earn
est, all the time. Don't say you
haven't been, too."
She was silent.
"Weren't you In earnest?" he asked
In pleading tones.
'Her eyes were looking pensively, far
away, but her hand tightened about
hia.
"Did you ever suppose I was a kin
dergarten for Nan's suitors?" she
asked.
Every one is ready to leave the cupola
after this and the next thing is to
descend to the balcony of the third
story again, going the other way this
time and making another fifty feet of
distance without touching the ground.
It leads to another bridge which is at
tached to the side of the house by a
â¢ort of pivot and which stretches out,

On the wall is the sign that brings
forth one of the oddest things in the
house. It reads. *'Please do not spit
on the floor without permission. Spit
toon under the sofa/' If the owner
of the house is with the visitor who
reads the *ism. hÂ« will emlle. for he
alone knows what will happen.
The visitor who reaches for the cus
pidor under the sofa gets a surprise.
He gets th * cuspidor out Just beyond
the edge of the sofa, but Just let him
re!ax his hold on the thing a bit and It
flies under th* sofa in the twinkling
of an eye. If the visitor cares to get
down on his hands and knees he may
see a queer looking spiral spring at
tached to it. No one who visits the
house and is taken in by the oddest
thing In It â the Magic Cuspidorâ ever
tells any one else the secret of the sell,
10 everv one gets the full benefit of
the take-In.
The oddities are in evidence in ihe
eky parlor as well as everywhere
else. Between the windowB and above
them is a little, wall balcony, from
Â¦which points the index finger of a
emiling girl doll,, dressed in pink. Be
low her runs the legend, "Please reg
ister here," and on the table is the
puest register of the oddest house.
Its pages are covered with the signa
tures of people from all over the wide
earth. Famous autographs are among
them, and sometimes they are writ
ten in the Kky parlor at the rate of
more than thirty a day.
From the heart of the Wonder Tree
a narrow bridge in midair stretcher
for fifty feet and connects with the
third story of the oddest house. This
bridge is continued twice around the
house in the form of a balcony. That
completes eighty feet more of the
journey that the visitor is making in
midair. Finally the balcony makes a
eharp little twist and runs steeply up
to the cupola crowning the third story,
seventy- five feet above the ground.
From the little glass inclosed eky
parlor with its cushioned seats the
eye takes in a view that is matchless
In loveliness. Beyond the city lie
stretched the turquoise blue waters of
the bay. Beyond them rises the
great caravansary at Coronado, and
out into the clear waters creeps tem
ple-crowned Point Loma, mysterious
and 6ilent- The eye lingers on Silver
Strand and Ocean Islands, then ranges
on toward a broader panorama, tak
ing in National City, Chula Vista, the
hazy mountains and distant Mexico.
Silence is the tribute most often paid
to this picture seen from the oddest
house in California.
This trip is started on from the heart
of the Wonder Tree, which must be
thirty feet or so above the ground, and
Is reached by a flight of steps. At a
casual glance one would call the tree a
weeping willow, but the fact that it is
not is one of the queer things about it
that gives it the odd name, the Wonder
Tree. The tree in reality- is a eucalyp
tus twelve years old. Six years ago
the master of the oddest house began
the course of training on this tree which
resulted in making it truly the Wonder
Tree. Ke sawed the tree off squarely
ncroEs its trunk, many feet above the
ground. By and by the green sprouts
began to corr.e, shooting straight up
toward the sky, after the manner of
all eucalyptus kind. As fast as they
came they were each one tied by a cord
down below and trained to grow over
in a graceful spray, like the weeping
willow.
Right in the heart of this sheaf of
green streamers was built three years
later a platform, with rustic seats suf
ficient to accommodate eight people,
and wired in and out to keep the tree
branches in place as supports for the
aerial bower. Now it is as though
the seats were set in a foundation of
living green and from below the re
treat is completely hidden. Strange
ly enough, two of the green whip
like branches that were trained to
grow downward have refused to wear
any foliage, but run in and out among
the green of the Wonder Tree, in
length perhaps twenty feet or more,
and resembling dull, grayish thongs,
terminating in a few green leaves.
These two oddities have been wonder
ed at by horticulturists and scientists
alike.
s~y AN DIEGO is the proud possess-
V^X eor ot the oddest house In Cali
w*J fornia. Even its owner has a
L,_ ir y touch of quaintness, and no
X. wonder, for it is he who thought
out and planned the unheard of sur
prises and bizarre effects which greet
the visitor on even* side so long as he
remains on the premises. Who ever
heard of even- an enchanted castle with
a bouquet to perform the office of a
gate opener?
Watch what happens when to enter
the grounds of the oddest house in
California you pull a cord just above
the gateway. You have tried the gate
in every other way and the only thing
to do is to pull that cord. Swish!
From out of nowhere, apparently, like
Cinderella's coach in the transforma
tion scene, a huge bo-uquet of scarlet
geraniums end vari-colored foliage
dips down on a level with the visitors
nose. Lo! the gateway to the en
chanted castle is open and the flowers
remain invitingly suspended in mid
air. This is the beginning of the leger
demain practiced on the guileless
stranger by the owner of the place,
Coionel J. R. Dye.
He came to San Diego nine year* ago
from Nebraska, sick nigh unto death.
He was popularly expected to die
Â¦without further orders, but concluded
to live and put his ideas into Dye Villa,
which has evoluted year by year, as
tt were, into its present superlative
oddity. "All the work of my own
hands," proudly says the quaint man
nered owner, "and I have never had
to take back a single thing I started.
Always stuck to my original idea."
And one can quite believe this before
returning from a tour of the place.
The oddest house seems to have
everything that the fairy books of
one's childhood called for. In lieu of
the Flying Carpet of the Arabian
Nights, one may take a trip out
through space in tlie Swinging Tree.
The Enchanted Mirror, the Magic
Walk, a Fairy Fish Pond with linings
cf pearl, they" are all there. Moreover,
one has only to wish for It and a trip
may be made over the whole place and
everything be seen, inside and out of
the house, without once touching foot
to the ground.
Under an arbor is what Colonel Dye
calls the cobblestone parlor, for every
part of it, floor and all. is made from
cobblestones hauled there by his own
hands. The cobblestones are treated
with cement in fashioning the settees,
etc., and tinted a peculiar shade of
brown, that gives it the appearance,
Descending to eart>. once more, the
grounds are found to be as odd as the
bouse. One. of the oddest things is a
suspended cage filled with canaries.
From the cage to the bridge connecting
with the Wonder Tree is a sort of cir
cular tubing of wire netting about
twenty feet long, at the other end of
which there are suspended crystal
basins, into which water is constantly
dripping from above; The birds are
not well trained, for Colonel Dye usu

knocking on the outside of the cage
they are made to promenade through
the wire netting pathway to bathe or
drink at the farther end.

THE ODDEST HOUSE
IN CALIFORNIAMore fixed and stately In design Is
the Milan straw fedora, which la a
shape much affected by the young and
middle-aged alike.
However, In the matter of hats of
a finer quality, there are some others
of imported Italian braid and fancy
straw that are distinct novelties, and
which promise to become almost as
popular as either the Panama or the
Mexican palm as soon as they become
better known.
One of these Is the Italian braid
Pantourist fedora, which, though it 13
a long name, la a very expressive title
for a very picturesque hat, almost as
picturesque though a little less pliable
than the Panama itself. It la particu
larly becoming Â«to young men. and
when made Into the Optimo shape Is
very genteel indeed for middle-aged
men. Many of the younger set, how
ever, have appropriated . the optimo
as their own exclusive style.

both designed particularly for middle
aged men, but the straw Itself as well
as the weave is of a vastly different
quality from any of those mentioned
above.

handling and still retain their shape.

much crushed and never creased, is.
with its wide rolling brim and pointed
peak, one of the most popular, because
the most becoming of all the new hats
of' the summer season. The negligee,
except that the brim Is more bowl
shaped and rolling, is almost an exact
copy In straw of the tan colored felt
campaign hats worn by Uncle Sam's
boys during the late war. This hat is
much affected by the younger set. pos
sibly btcause it' gives its wearer a
rakish look, a devil-may-care and
swagger air. Possibly the fact that it
Is designed peculiarly for long wear
and. hard usage may have something to
do with its popularity.
The split straw with the narrow
brim and high crown, which has been
spoken of before, and the Sennit yacht
with the fancy braid as well as the
Sennit yacht with the wide brim,
sound very much alike, while as a
matter of fact they are as different as
a woman's hats for morning and even
ing wear. The first Is of very fine,
closely woven straw, while the next
la a Little finer, bothjn weave and in
the roughness of the material, while
the last named is a hat of very striking
appearance, both as to the shape of
the hat Itself and the cut and weave
of the straw, which ils very rough and
open.
As model hats for dress-up occa
sions any of these three would not
only be appropriate, but exceptionally
becoming to clean-cut features. In
deed, the wearer of one of these hats
becomes at once the Ideal summer
man. '
As an extreme contrast to any of
the above mentioned hats are the new
creations of Mexican palm rope,
which, while they have the finish of
the Sennit yacht hats, combine thÂ«Â»
fineness of weave and the pliancy of
the Panama. As before mentioned the
Mexican palm telescope is one of the
most fashionable hats of the year,
while for the man of any age, though
more particularly for the man of mid
dle age, there are the Mexican palm
optimo and the Mexican palm rope

same In shape and design as the for

Bertram Hale approached a charm
ing residence set back from the street.
It was a new house, all gables and gar
goyles and jutting windows and varl
hued shingles. The windows' glittered
golfienly In the morning sunshine.
"Mr. Hale!"
A shadow crossed the broad, kltrdly
face of the Swedish maid who opened
the door to him.
"Iâ I am sorry, butâ"
She faltered. It was eagy enough to
utter the falsehood sanctioned by con
vention to any other caller. But to
him who had always been so gay, so
courteous, so truly the kind of a lover
that all the world perforce must love,
the found it impossible to speak the
sentence with which he was to be
greeted.
"That's all right, Lena," he eald,
quite as cordially as though she had
held the door wide for him in the old
fashion, instead of standing stolidly on
the threshold. "I know Miss Ruth
wished you to say she was not at home
to me. But â she Is at home, if not to
roe. I want 'you to take her this box,
Lena." He extended a square parcel
DÂ£ he epoke. "There^are pansles in it.
Pansies, you know, stand for kind
thoughts."
"I will try," Lena assured him. with
friendly willingness. "Come into the
hallâ the parlor."
"No, I'll wait here." young Hale de
cided, and sat down on the ledge of
the porch.
"Mr. Hale," she -fd coaxlngly,
"he says will you come down to . see
him Just one little minute."
Ruth Seldon was- not a beauty, al
though Bertram Hale would have dis
puted this assertion. But she was a
mighty attractive looking girl. The
kimona of silvery silk which she
wore, with its shell-pink lining, and
loosely-knotted, gold-fringed girdle,
was Just the thing to bring out tha
fresh tints of her skin and the clear
luster of her blue, black-lashed eyes.
"Take it back, Lena!" she com
manded. "Say to Mr. Hale that I
cannot receive him. Tell him that he
will be handed a â a package from me
this afternoon."
Lena knew well what that package
would contain. For on the desk were
lettersâ nyiny letters. On the shelf
over the desk a photograph frame
still stood, but the handsome face that
used to smile forth from it so sun
nily was 'there no longer. A tiny
leather box topped the letters., Lena
could not be positive what the box
contained, but she did notice that no
ring with 1 one white, flaming stone
sparkled -as formerly on the hand of
her young mistress.
"He does look that sad, Miss!"
Lena remarked, lingering. "I â I think
maybe he is sick." she Insinuated.
Ruth flushed and her lips parted
irresolutely. The next instant she
turned back to her desk.
"Take him back the flowersâ I sup
pose they are flowers â and the mes
sage at once!"
Lena's sigh seemed to be drawn
Ruth Seldon looked up from her

all her love letters and little love
tokens tied neatly up and ready to re
turn, sat looking with a feeling of
strange desolation at the frame which
had held the picture of Bertram Hale.
She wondered as the glorious spring
day wore away how It would seem to
go on and on without him through all
the days to come. She was right to
break with him. He had been wrong to
show Mabel Harvey s- much attention,
even if she was his cousin, and here on
a visit. He had almost forgotten one
of the dances she had promised him,
because he had been showing: Mabel tha
family portrait But â how strange It
would seem not to look forward to his
approval whenever she donned a new
dress, or* learned a new song, or
chanced on some beautiful thought or
story. *
Tes. It would be all very strange â
and sad, but doubtless she would be
come used to the separation. Onlyâ
A quick shriek startled her. It came
from below stairs. It was such a choked
cry of horror as she fancied might be
uttered by one suddenly assailedâ
stabbed! 1: ; :-
She sprang up, ran to the door and
down the stairs.
The front door stood ajar. Ruth could
see the gray-clad form of the postman
crossing the street from their house.
Lena, ghastly white, an open letter in
her rough hand, was leaning against
the banister. She had received some
terrible shock.
"Lena!" cried the girl. "Tell me what
is wrong!"
Mutely the'peasant woman held out
the letter.
"I cannot read It," Ruth cried. "It
is in your language. Tell me! You
have had bad news?"
. "De worst newsâ -de worst!" she
panted. Her stricken, face was up
lifted. Its pathetic hopelessnessâ Its
bitter abandonment, went straight to
the heart of the girl beside her.
"It is my lover. Miss Ruth! He
vas to be my man â but I did get angry
and sail avay with mine own people,
and say no, I vould not marry him.
But he did write to me, and I vaa
sorry, and I did answer and say to
him to come. But now he Is dead
he is dea'd!" Her voice rose Into a
pitiful wall. "He Is dead and he can
nefer come any more at all â not efer
any more!"
Then there was no sound save her
broken, desolate sobbing-. Ruth Sel
don put both arms around the broad
shoulders. She kissed the wet cheeks
and smoothed the coarse, yellow hair.
"Poor Lena!' she whispered. "Poor
Lena! Come and lie down. No, never
mind the work! Come!"
She shut the door and drew the
maid away, up -to her own room.
"I said I did not lofe him â but I
did! I vaa angry, and I say vot vaa
not true. Now he vill nefer know
that I did lofe him alvays â that I vill
never have no other man In all my
life â for he vaa the only vun for me!"
When she had Quieted the suffering
creature, Ruth left her and went back
to her desk. She looked at the pack
age, at the frame from which the pic
ture was absent. It seemed as though
this news that had been sent from over
the sea had come directly to her. What
if the message had been of Bertram?
Would she be angry now, resentful?
Bit by bit she went over their little
dissensions. Wa3 it worth a heart
ache, when all was said? Could she
ever love any other as she loved him?
Her heart gave prompt reply.
Meehanfcally. she untied the pack
age, and replaced the picture in the
frameâ the letters in the draper, tha
other treasures each in Its accustomed
place. Then she opened the tiny box
and took out a ring that sparkled like
a star of promise, and slipped It on her
linger.
"For he vas de only vun for me!"
"Poor Lena!" said the girl who. with
shining eyes and rose-red cheeks, went
downstairs to the telephone. On the
way she paused to open the little box
on the hall table, and to fasten the
panslea over her heart.

perhaps does not matter very much.
The main fact is that there nevtr were

hats to choose from for hot weather.
There are straw hats for the young

man. straw hats for the old man and
straw hats for the boy. Each age has

enviable reputation in his art,

more danger in a "foul, tip" or a

perhaps the most dangerous, seeing
that it involves the deception of the
catcher himself.

object of training Is not merely to make
children obedient. It" is not .to make
them behave. , It is not to keep them

We are all very apt to treat with too

yearsâ scars ) which .even future kind
ness can never "efface.
Other .things being equal, the indi
vidual who can control himself is likely
to be most happy. Whether or not a
person is liable to control himself will
largely' depend upon his training In
early life. At times it may require only
loving kindness upon the part of 'the
parent; or it may require much firm
ness also. Almost all children can be
taught self-control when -young. That
is the time to help them. Life with,
them Is a constant warfare.* We must'
stand ready to help them battle against
self, as well as against- outside influ
ence. i.Don't bribe your child to control
himself in any way. This is a great
mistake, and evil results will have to
be borne later by /both parents and
child. '
There is no place for scolding or
nagging in the ; training of children.
Yet how many of us are apt to do so.
Some say they do this so that they
need not whip -their children. But
this will have a worse effect on a
child's . character â¢ than a reasonable
amount of whipping, Inflicted at a
proper time and In a proper manner.
If a child has done wrong he should
be spoken to in a kindly and, if nec
essary, in a very firm tone. How
ever, It should be done in the natural
tone of voice at, all times. '-
We are apt to magnify the faults of
children. Let us remember that many
of the so-called faults are not faults,
but are natural actions, which they
should and will outgrow.
When you hesitate as to whether I or
not you â¢, should .refuse some : request
made, do, not consider whether the re
quest would have 'been a- foolish one
for. you, -but rather " whether 'Â¦> it is a
proper one for' the child. The child who
finds he is treated' in' this way will not
hesitate to ask for things which other
wise he would get by stealth;
"don't" to our- children too often?
One is reminded of the boy, who,
when asked his name, said his right
name was "Willie Smith." but it
seemed to be generally "Willie Don't."
Many children are completely ruin
ed by the threats which parents make
and fail to carry out. How often we
promise to do something "next time."
What a mistake! We should do some
thing now. or say nothing. A little
punishment or rewarding in the pres
ent is more powerful than ten times
the amount, promised for delivery at .

It Is very important that we parents
should appreciate the necessity of leav
ing children to themselves, that they
may do about as they wish. While the
child roust be trained, it is not neces
sary that he should be under supervi
sion all the time. If he is, he Is likely
to become so antagonistic that he can
not be trained as he should. Â¦
One great mistake, which most of
us parents make, is that we uejoo
willing to take issue with â¢ our chil
dren ; upon every occasion. â¢ No pa
rent should hesitate to do so when It
is necessary. Such as do will suffer
later. However, Issues can be avoid
ed by exercising a small amount of
tact and common sense. It Is espe
cially necessary wjth children of cer
tain temperaments at times. â¢ It is ab
solutely necessary that the parents
should strive to avoid direct Issues.
Is It not true that all of us say
There is a great tendency to over
training on the part of ministers and
others who are intensely interested in
the proper management of their chil
dren. The failure of such in the train
ing of their children has almost become
proverbial. It is certainly not because
of lack of love or Interest; but, realiz
ing the importance of proper training
there Is apt to be too much training.
Then, too, it must be remembered that
the failings of these children are likely
to be unduly magnified by both parents
and others.
an objection In a proper spirit, it is
sometimes proper, to give reasons. For
example, suppose a boy is told not to
take the shortest way. He may be told
the reason then; or, later, it may be
well to tell him you knew there was a
cross dog at the corner, and that you
feared that he might be bitten. Care
should also be taken to express pleas*
ure that the question was asked in the
way that it should have been asked,
and that there was no hesitation about
obedience.

show it. Somebody proffers her a rug:,
another a book, which she accepts with,
a smile. (What a feeble smile it Is!)
She makes a pretense at reading, but
presently she puts the book aside with
a sigh and sits thinking, thinking, al
ways thinking.
Petty beside this appear -the Imagi
nary troubles of a dear little American
girl who has been spending a couple of
years in New Zealand.
- "Say," she mournfully complains in
broad "American accent, "everybody Is
saying that I don't talk a bit like an
American. I do hope that isn't true. I
want everybody to know I'm an Ameri
can and that I'm going home."
She sits on th* bridge companion
steps, her blue eyes looking wistfully
homeward. "I do wish this old boat
would Ju3t hurry." she keeps saying.
One morning our cyclist-hating Eng
lishman nearly worked himself into an
apoplectic fit. He had come upon a
book 'of essays on a vacant deck chair
and settled' himself to read. Presently
the crack cyclist happened along and
claimed the book as his.
"By gad, sir," said the Johnny, sub
sequently describing the incident to his
clique . in the smoking-room, "the
boundafc actually reads Ruskln. Ten
nyson and all our othah top-notchers."
There are a few nervous people on
board who. in anticipation of their
visit to the United States, have "read
up" works on America. Foster Fraser's
"America at "Work." Kipling's "From,
Sea to Sea," and "A Frenchman's Im
pressions of America" are much in evi
dence â as a consequence a few people
are asking each other for Information
about "bunko-steerers" and such like
dangerous things. For the special
benefit of the nervous ones the funny
man on board told the following yarn:
"The Amalgamated Bunkc-Steerers*
Society of San Francisco, which boasts
a membership, list 15,000 strong, has
what they call its Intelligence depart
ment; that is. It keeps paid members
of the society on all boats and trains
to put chalk marks upon the backs of
passengers worth exploiting. The
chalk marks denote to the operating
members on shore the extent of the
bearer's belongings. Passengers leav
ing the steamer at Frisco with chalk
marked coats advise the bunko-steerers
on wharf duty thÂ© exact extent of
their valuables and where they are
going to put up."
"I'll tell you something m confi
dence," whispered the low-comedy
man, and his listeners expectantly
drew closer. "There are seven mem
bers of the Amalgamated Bunko-
Steerers* Society's intelligence staff on
this ship now."
And the low-comedy man left a group
of nervous men obligingly looking for
chalk-marks on each other's backs.
It was the privilege of the writer tat
accompany the commander and his of
ficers on his daily tour of "inspec
tion." The progress of the official par
ty throughout the huge vessel la
marked by the severest discipline. The
care and attention bestowed upon tha
most minute details is simply as
tounding. Now and again during tho
tour the captain would stop to speak a
few kindly words to a poor foreigner
In the steerage, or, while his eagle eye
took in the sanitary condition of a
sick man's cabin, a cheery story from
7\ JTR. BERT LEVY, who ar
l \/\ rived in San Francisco two
y,/ J weeks ago on the Sonoma
JL from Australia, is one of the
best-known artists in the Antipodes.
For over ten years he was connected
with the Sydney Bulletin, one of the
largest papers in the colonies, where
he made himself famous ,for his pic
tures depicting the Jewish character,
while for the last four years he has
been on the staff of The Age, pub
lished by the multi-millionaire, David
Symes, in Melbourne, where he gained
even greater prominence for his
sketches of the Jewish type in par
ticular, and his cartoons of famous
men in general, as well as for the
able articles from his pen which ac
companied all his drawings. At the
same time he is known professionally
as one of the best fcenic artists that
has ever painted for the big theaters
in Australia.
Mr. Levy is himself a Jew, who was
born in Australia, and his present
visit, which, by the way, is his first
trip across the Pacific, is made ex
pressly for the purpose of closing ne
gotiations with one of the big East
ern publishing houses for the repro
duction of a series of his Jewish pic
tures, among which is the "Tephillan,"
which is a marvelous study of an aged
Jew in the midst of the orthodox
prayer, and the '"Kaddish," which de
picts a Jewish father and his two sons
with tear-stained faces turned toward
the east while they repeat a prayer
for the departed wife and mother. It
is the strength and pathos as well as
the absolute fidelity to the Jewish
characteristics that have won. Ench
widespread praise and admiration for
these works.
It is perhaps a remarkable coinci
dence that simultaneous with Mr.
Levy's arrival the Sunday Call should
be preparing for the publication of
"The Fugitive," a new novel, fresh
from the hands of the author. Ezra S.
Brudno, less than three months ago,
b'Jt which has already become one of
the most talked of books in both
Europe and America because of the
masterful way it depicts the life of
the Jews both in Russia and New
York, and which Mr. Sorners, the head
of the book department at the Em
porium, declares will be one of the
biggest selling books of the year.
Beginning next Sunday, June 12, it
will be published comolete in five in
stallments, and in order ta make its
appearance all the more notable, Mr.
Levy has been specially commissioned
to remain in San Francisco and il
lustrate it lavishly from beginning to
end in his best style, exclusively for
the Sunday CalL
Thus under the Sunday Call's
liberal and progressive literary policy
of giving its readers the very latest
high class literature by the best writ
ers of the day, there has been secured
DAINTT guide books scattered
throughout the big ocean liners
describe the beauties of the Isl
and paradise on the route from
the Antipodes to California, but no
mention Is made of the chief beauty of
travelâ the beauty of human compan
ionship that is fully matured on board
ship. Amusing, indeed, it Is to watch
the gradual thawing of the icy man
ners adopted by some people at the
etart of the voyage. The sour-faced,
sarcastic man who found fault with
the nuts and cheese two hours out from
Evfiney proves by the time we reach

tortured surfaces of the alluvial* fields
of old Ballarat and Bendigo, (heir na
tive towns, were in earnest conversa
tion with morose types of British globe
trotters, and, 'like the high light on a
pleasing picture, was the animated but
friendly discussion between an Arch
bishop and a German Jew. "Where else
but amid the friendly environments en
gendered by a long ocean voyage could
such Ideal conditions prevail 7
There Is a lady on board who would
prove a veritable gold mine of copy
to a writer of farce. She appears at
breakfast in black satin and diamonds
and does not keep the story of her daily
life a secret. ...Â¦Â¦-
"Every morning of my life," she tells
her neighbors at the. table in a con
fidential whisper that can be heard
above the roar of steam and storm,
"my maid brings a cup of tea to my
bedside," and then almost In the. same
breath she summons a passing stew
ard: "Hey, mister, fetch us a bit more
toast."'
Th- passengers at -a certain saloon
table rejoiced, in the -possession of an
Irish-Australian mining magnate, and
the unconsciously humorous Â¦ remarks
that he let fall were as rich and plenti
ful aa gold speaks In the. wash-dirt of
the renowned ' district from which he
hailed. - â¢ â¢
"Good mornlnV he said, seating him
self at breakfast. "We'll pass the Ven
toora this mornln', I belalve."
.One of . his, table mates ventured the
opinion that we had passed -our sister
ship in thÂ« night. - . â¢
"Oh, no," end the Irishman, "I was
talkin' to wan of the .officers while he
was cleaning the floor Â¦ in Â¦ the smoking
room an' he ' said we'd pass It ' this
mornin'." .. . . ~
Â¦ .To leave the crowd of good-natured,
happy fellows holding a "Calcutta" on
the ship's run and to look at the sad

writer who is said to have laid bare
the inner secrets of his own life in
"The Fugitive," but the superb and
authentic art work of a man equally
famous from another far distant
quarter of the trlobe both brought to
gether for the first time in one edition
to picture the sorrows and sufferings,
the ideals and the history of their
own race, as well as to reveal the se
cret of the cause and the effect of
their ceaseless persecution through
the ages.
In the following article Mr. Levy
has written of the humors and de
lights of s trip across the Pacific on
a big Oceanic liner and illustrated it
with some characteristic drawings
which speak for themselves. They
are however, mere rapid sketches,
giving no idea of the real skill and
power shown in his finished work.
the captain would gratify the occu
pant
Of course, the beauties of the Island
scenery en route have been described
again and again. Americans are fa
miliar with the grand in nature, for at
their own" door nature haa laid many
treasures. * But like unto an oasis In
the desert is Honolulu to an Australian
who has painted all his life among the
gum trees of his own dear country and
leaves it for the first time to gaze upon
the Island.
The writer stood spellbound for aa
hour beside the celebrated Pall - and
felt for the first time that to try to
Imitate, nature with brush aad paint
is, after all, only a little mockery. All
the adjectives that one eaa apply to
Honolulu have been applied bÂ«Â£ars
scores of times, and one who really
feels it deep down can only sign and
say nothing.

.chorus (to the concluding bars of "Auld

* was more expressive than elegant.
Again' and again from the American

punctured by the "chorus, rendered
fortissimo, and when the good-natured

blustering rage the atmosphere became
\ delightfully socialâ everybody "lighted

â¢looking upon 'the : scene through the
haze of tobacco smoke one could
scarcely realise that we were thousands
of miles 'from anywhere, in the midst
of the Pacific. Here were men gathered
from the four Quarters of the globe, op

Table grumblers, as a rule, are beau
tifully silent after about ten hours

who live on bread and Jam all the year
round, and when they are invited to a
wedding adversely criticize the cham

irrespressible, but gets a bad time from
healthy passengers! And no voyage
could bring forth more humor than a
trip across the Pacific on one of these
big liners. . : . . y
"They say dat Pritannia rules .dt
waves," said a sick Jew the first day
out, leaning over the ship's rail. and
mournfully anticipating an Internal dis
turbance.- "Veil, I vtsh she'd V ruled

The sight of some bright American
boys placing an empty whisky bottle
and a glass by the deck chair of the
sleeping Archbishop is calculated to
bring a smile to the most melancholy
face, and when the "Johnny" who has
been minutely describing his "twenty-
eight voyages across the Pacific, don't

against seasickness, turns pale and sud-

of answersâ bracelets, belt buckle, spec
tacles. Jewel, ruby,. diamond, etc, while
on the other hand you were all very

I / editor hea the painful duty of
VO calling your attention to the fact
V that there are far less than the
fu]l 150 prize winners. Why? Sure
ly those puzzles of May 22 were easy.
Tou all knovr about the different kinds
of boat* and the different things seen
In a Jewelrr store, and yet there were
only 111 who guessed them correctly.
This is simply astonishing when It is
considered that there were thousands
of answers. Some of the children
ruessed jewelrr for the whole eight
pictures, while other* again gave the
names of boats to all of the puzzles.
Again, there were hundreds upon hun
dreds who guessed the first three boat
puzzles correctly, only to stumble over
the fourth picture, . many calling it &
merchantman, a barge, a cutter, a
launch, a brig and even, an Ironclad.
That was the wildest sort of gueasinj
for a. very easy puzzle.
But even more haphazard were the
guesses over tae next four puzzlesâ the
things seen in a JÂ«wclry store. These
ruzzles, which v.cre thought to be by
far the easiest, you really made the
most blunders over, possibly because
there are so many things seen In a

BARRYMORES TO ENTERTAIN.

the Shelbourne Hotel, Dublin, for a
portion of the season. Their house in>

large or Imposing to enable them to

preparations in Dublin to receive a
number of American frtends-during the

hotel and it is understood that they
will have fifty or sixty smart Ameri
cans staying there. . The majority of
the party will attend the two fashlon,
able race meetings which . will be in
progress >n the neighborhood of Dub
lin during the royal visit. Lord and
Lady Barrymore will be at the Mar
quis of Ormonde's place in Kilkenny
during the King's visit. there, but it is
doubtful If they will be invited to Lis
more Castle by the Duke a'nd Duchess
of Devonshire. Lord Barrymore has
never been much in favor by either the
Duke or. the, Duchess, although the
latter has a great admiration for many
of the American women who are con

ently trustworthy and Indisputable

there Is stilh needed the color which

That Is where the X-rays come in to

purse of the buyer and the capacity
of the seller to lie eloquently and per

it is perhaps the poor worms that after
all are most deserving of sympathy.

TRAITS OF THE LETTERS.
Instead of the direct appeal from
one man of common sense to another,
always one of the most effective weap
ons in his debating armory, there was
a tone of supor-exaltation, an air of
abstraction as of a man speaking
from the clouds to more benighted hu
man beings. His refusal to permit his
policy to be debated In Parliament was
after all nothing short of a confession
of failure, and it is so felt by all his
followers. -

Chamberain's protectionist propaganda

fierce as those created by Gladstone in

LONDON, June 4.â "It has come to
be a case of dreary megolomania,"
was the disappointed comment of one
of Joseph Chamberlain's warmest sup
porters in the lobby of the House of
Commons after hearing the ex-Secre
tary's speech Wednesday night.
The vigor, incislveness, lightning
like rapidity of retort, lucidity of ex
pression and skillful presentation of a
bad case, the gifts which made him
the most potent, of living Parliament
figures, had vanished.
There remained instead a certain
cleverness such as an accomplished
artist still retains in his decay, a
marked physical feebleness of utter
ance and absence of grip, a note of
weariness almost pathetic, and a sub
conscious acknowledgment of defeat
which took all the heart out of his
supporters. They had come, to cheer,
but they remained to reflect. Most
strange of ajl, the keen, hard-cut face,
with Its suggestion of steely determi
nation was overspread all the' time by
a self complacent smile.

distinguished lord wardens, among
them William Pitt, the great Duke of

in order that he might be entitled to
a salute of guns â an honor which pos

The Duke of Wellington was Lord
Warden of the Cinque Ports from 1829
until his death in 1852, and spent the
autumn of each year at Walmer. For
visitors to the castle the chief object
of interest Is the Duke's bedroom,
where he died. Lord wardens may

her guests waiting for her, including

Also, which was worse, that when she
arrived she would take the Duke of
Connaught's arm and head the pro
cession to the banquet hall or the ball
room, or whatever apartment was to
be the scene of the festivities. Now,
say those who are versed in the high
and mighty mysteries of etiquette as
appertaining to royalty, this was tan
tamount to assuming that she was the
first lady In, the land, whereas her of
ficial position as wife of the Viceroy
was merely that of his first subject,
and the Duchess of Connaught as the
representative of the reigning Emper
or should have been accorded preced
ence over her. Wherefore, it is
d<?cl8rpd. those who beheld Lady Cur
zon's conduct were shocked and hor
rified at the presumption of the Chi
cago girl. Tidings of it reached Kins
Edward and ruffled the serenity of his
temper, for though ordinarily easy

stowal of the office on Lord Curzon a
flattering one, and to some extent also
it may be regarded as further proof of
the King's" well known partiality for
American women and American wives.
But it is no secret In court circles
that for a while, not long ago, Lady
Ourzon was "persona non grata" with
his Majesty. This was due to the fact
that as Vicereine of India, Lady Cur
zon counted too much on the dignity
which her husband's rank conferred
upon her and oven went to the length
of claiming and taking precedence of
feminine royalty in the person of the

old turbulent days of English history
Â¦before England had an established

later the post of Lord Warden was one
of great importance and power. But
Â¦when England had learned to rely on
the puns cf her navy, instead of im

keep foreign foes at bay, the office was
gradually shorn of its authority and
has long been a merely ornamental
one.
LONDON. June 4.â Lord Curzon's ap
pointment as Lord Warden of the
Claque Ports is generally regarded as
evidence that he will not agafn return
to India as Viceroy despite semi-offi
cial denials. Although the functions of
the once high and mighty office of
Lord Warden have long been merely
nominal, one of its requirements Is that
Its recipient should reside for a speci
fied period of each year at the official
residence, Walmer Castle. That obli
gation would seem to debar Lord Cur
con from retaining at the same time
the position of Viceroy of India, as the
Job of governing that empire Is too- big
a ore to be undertaken by an absen

"I have more pupils than I can find
time to instruct," said the fair pro

speaking parts at social functions still
to participate in a measure in the dis

difference which characterizes many
English society women when they
listen to a conversation in which they
are not directly participating Is no
longer to be regarded as a mark of

all-conquering American girl is re
sponsible for a new feminine pro
fession hereâ the teaching of the
art of gesticulation. In seeking
some explanation of the popularity of
trans- Atlantic maidens, English women
imagine, that they have discovered it in
the animation of their countenances
when conversing and the free use they
make of gestures. Many of those "in
the swim" have resolved to go and do
.-likewise, and some one has arisen to
show them how. And so it comes
about that that immobility of feature,
the calm inscrutability of expression
and the air of serene and lofty com
posure, which are supposed to be the
most cherished hall marks of the inner
circles of British fashion, are to be
abandoned. The talking is no more to
be done by the. lips alone; eyes and
eyebrows, facial muscles and fingers,
are to play their parts in the exchange
of ideas "a la belle Americalne." Vac

already been all over Walmer Castle
and have given orders for its general
refurbishing. Tapestry of an expensive
and elaborate character will be intro

paid to fixing up the bedrooms in mod

I am told, by the way, that, when
Mrs. Lelter first popped her head into
the chamber consecrated to mementoes
of the Iron Duke and saw its contents
she expressed her intention of making
a clean sweep of "that old rubbish."
But when she learned that the "old
rubbish" was one of the most prized
heirlooms of the nation she consoled
herself with the reflection that there
were plenty of other rooms on which
her American housewifely energies
could be freely expended.

desired, to control their own bookings.
The agency succeeded In effecting ar
rangements with many theaters
throughout the United States and a
few months ago the probabilities were
that the independent ranks would be
largely augmented. At that time more
than thfrty first-class attractions were
preparing to join us.
"The unexpected union of the Stair
and Havlln circuit with the syndicate
defeated these plans, which were based
chiefly upon' Mr. Stair's assurances
that his theaters would remain open to
independent first-class attractions . for
a period of years. Moreover, the bad
season and many disasters to expen-
society, and every little German vil
lage of 30.000 has its symphony," I
grumbled. "How is it?"
Mr. Berthold thought a moment.
He has a habit of thinking before he
speaks. Then he decided: "I think
it, is. because In Germany they will not
do without music. They never think
of going without it any more than of
going without dinner. It is part of
their meat. It never stops. If it is
not grand opera it is comic opera all
the year round. And then there will
be even in small places ten or twelve
symphony concerts every season.
Then there are the fine military bands
and they never play trash. They play
in the parks, and if it severely rains
they play in laKge music halls, where
one may drink and smoke. Music is
not there a luxury; it is a neces
"But where do you get your sym
phony orchestra in a small town?" I
appealed.
"From the theaters,** Berthold replied.
"On the concert night they give plays
in which they will need no orchestra,
so as not to interfere."
Simplicity itself!
"And the pecuniary support?"
"Everybody subscribes, of course,"
the singer settled it. Of course!
"Then." he volunteered further, "the
symphony concerts are not society af
fairs."
As the singer leaned forward to em
phasize his point, elbow on the seat in
front, his chin on his hand, I got my
first good view of that Anton Seidl-like
head. There is the same broad.clear
brow; clean-cut, classic lips; gray eyes,
now with a glint of fun in them, and
clear as truth Itself. And there's a
good, big, practical nose to balance
much of mysticism one finds in the
face.
Later, inevitably, we got to the Ger
man transcendentalists. Nietzsche and
his" "overman" came up in the connec
tion.
"Shall I guide my life by Nietszehe?â
he died mad,"' the singer cried. Then,
with the archaic earnestness that dis
tinguishes him, the accent somehow
cloistral that invests Mr. Berthold's
lightest word, the tenor said: "By their
fruits ya shall know them. Madness is
not the lot of the truly wise."
Whatever he has lived byâ and I take
it to be a mixture of Buddhism by way
of Schopenhauer, Swedenborgianism
probably, Christianity certainlyâ it has
written a fine sanity, kindness, wisdom,
deeply into the Berthold face.
But he was finding mild amusement
in our society patronage of the sym
phony concerts. I offered wisely: "But
you owe your musical development in
Germany originally to aristocratic
patronage!"
"A long time ago," he demurred,
smilingly, "and it is an insecure foun
dation. An art becomes vital only in
so far as it js the very life of the
people. The highest development of
German music is, of course, instru
mental, and." the singer added, "it is
the highest form. What can be finer?
I can't imagine anything more beauti
ful than a great symphony, played by a
splendid orchestra."
"Then you do not think the" German
excels in the vocal art?" I asked.
"No, not as to pure vocalism. That
the Italians have given us once for
all," the singer generously conceded.
He put up then a qualifying hand.
"Perhaps In Germany we sing more
musically. Few people know that
Wagner says precisely that he de
sires the retention of the Italian
method and its application to the mu
sic-drrfma needs."
I ventured: "Bayreuth says differ
ently."
"That is Mme. Wagner," Mr. Berthold
explained. "Every, artist who goes
there has to exaggerate. It is
Mme. Wagner's desire. And most
of them come away with a rough stylo
and a declamatory screech. But that
was not at all Wagner's intention.
Always he insisted on the beautiful
tone. He did not regard the voice as
the supreme, dominant interest anil
orchestra as purely accompaniment.
The voice has its place In the music
drama as one of the instruments, most
important, perhaps, but notâ"
He hesitated.

He made a wry face at the Irrever

on: 1 "And. look you, ifâ" his uplifted

â¢/rchestras so often have to stick to the
notes 'only. They don't see the man
up there"â Mr. Berthold fell into a first
fiddle with his nose in the score, and
then into a frantic conductor with a
hissing "pianissimo!" between his
teeth. "They don't know the operas,
in fact, and roar along unceasingly."
"What to do then?"

praise of his music, would swapper at

visible astonishment, pays he did so

I should be so happy to picture Mr.
Pr-rthold as a "born comedian." He
was so naively desirous of being taken
for one the other day when I had the
privilege of a chat with this rare
singer. But alas! I am compelled to
betray him. Everything else admirable
I found Mr. Berthold, but alack no
comedian. I could as well fancy Lo
hengrin in cap and bWls â and there you
have Barron Berthold, a modern Lo
hengrin.
Being a modern Lohengrin has its
advantages. Mr. Berthold did not
have to depend on a rickety swanship
lo carry him to the Tivoli where we
met. and his carefully worn gray suit
was undoubtedly more comfortable
than the Silver Knight's glad rags.
We wandered first up to the airy top
pallery of the theater, in search of
lipht for a photograph, the tenor ex
pressing much admiration on the way
for the fine opera-house.
Seriously, carefully. Mr. Berthold
"stood" then, using up as much con-
Fcience on a pose as some actors do
on a role. And then we went down
stairs, to the semi-gloom of the large
auditorium, sole audience of the big
clouds and drums of "The Toy
makers" 'set" on the stage.
We took fifty-cent sea-ts at the back,
and Mr. BerthoM began the business
of the interview by pulling out the
aforesaid Tageblatt notices.
/ "I should like, if you please, if you
would look at these articles," he be
*ran. holding them out with naive
pride.
"After you, my dear Mr. Berthold."
I rejoined, and the singer then trans
lated for me the Tageblatt's astonieh
men* at his excellent comedy, with its
incidental references to his admirable
.-.ccomplishments as a Wagnerian
Finger.
One could read a surprise equal to
the Tageblatt in the singer's tone.
Mr. Berthold has evidently made only
a recent and deligrhted acquaintance
with himself as a comedian. It was a
satisfaction so quaint, a pride bo in
nocent, that It was utterly without
offense.
"You see," the singer said gTavely,
ierÂ»ockcting the cuttinga, "you have
known me here only In serious roles,
I thought I should like you to know
that I have done well in comedy. The
Taseblatt critic is a very fine one.
too â 'his lovable intelligence makes it
self felt as well in the almost trivial

etill amiably conceited.
"It is not unusual," 1 Bald, "for
Kingrers in Germany to take both
comic and tragic parts."
"No." he agreed, "much more Is
expected in that way there than in
America. Still, hardly to the extent
of the difference between Fra Di
avolo an<i Tannhauser."
"You have suns Tannhauser' a
great deal. I understand?" I
prompted.
"One hundred and ten times now, last,
in Dresden and Cologne."
"J should think the Jew in 'La

you. I rcrr.omSer your performance

"I do like it." Mr. Berthold heart
ily confirmed. "It is a part that af
fords much opportunity for character- â
ization. and that is what I enjoy."
"They call you over there 'the

"Thcj' did," the "singing trage

facts that- my position may be fully

However, for the benefit of thosesfew

prospective dissolution of the Inde

theatrical season wÂ«.8 the principal
cause of the coalition between the syn

thereby closing to us the houses con
trolled by the latter firm. Following
this coalition came the failure of the
attractions sent out by Weber &
Fields, which very materially weaken
us| because without attractions it Is
almost impossible to induce managers
to keep their theaters open.
"Following this ,Weber & Fields
disposed of their theaters â the West
End in Harlem, the Globe in Boston
and the Broadway in Williamsburgâ "
to Messrs. Stair & Havlln, although
they had a five-year contract with the
"Owing to the withdrawal of Messrs.
Weber & Fields and Campbell from the
Independent Agency there remained
only fir. Hackett and myself. Mr.
Hackett having decided, for the rea
sons he has stated, to appear in
theaters booked by the syndicate next
season, it was decided to discontinue
the Independent Booking Agency.
"The discontinuance of the agency
will make no change^whatever in the
independent course pursued by Mrs.
Fiske and, myself, which we adopted in
1S96 and which we havÂ» steadfastly
and consistently followeu ever since.
We "believe that a monopolistic con
trol is opposed to the best interests
of the American theater and our be
lief has been . confirmed amply by the
developments that have grown out of
that control, the disastrous effects of
which are now plainly visible to every
thoughtful student of the theatrical
situation in this country.
"Mrs. Fiske will continue to play only
in independent theaters. The Manhat
tan Theater in New York will continue
to be an independent theater. Mrs.
Fiske will begin her next season in
September, at the Manhattan, where
she will fulfill a long engagement and
make several productions."
Mr. Hackett's, statement follows: â¢
The following statements of Harrison
Grey Fiske and James K. Hackett as to
the dissolution, of the .Independent
Booking Agency speak for themselves.
Their, fight has been a good one, and in
their defeat they have proved them
selves not less worthy. >4Ir. Fiske has
this to say: *
Â¦ "The' agency was organized in 1902.
James K. Hackett and myself believing
it would be advantageous to establish
a rallying point for the independent
movement and to concentrate the ener
gies of managers of attractions who
sive productions made by the syndicate
caused its members^to assume an at
titude of cauticm with respect to risk
ing new productions next season and
Accordingly they offered unusually fav
orable bookings to outside managers
who had had a hard time previously to
secure. suitable opportunities to pre
sent their attractions auspiciously.
This temporary change of policy on the
part of the syndicate removed sources
of discontent and prevented a number
of leading managers from carrying out
their original intention to Join the
ranks of the independents.
"It must not be supposed that the In
dependent Booking Agency has labored
in vain. It has had, in many instances,
a decided remedial effect; but I am
jÂ»orr>rN to say that I have discovered
that the very men who would have
benefited most >by the success o/ the
independent cause and who would
naturally have been supposed to ally
themselves with it after the pioneer
work had been done, have utilized it
for- selfish ends, while giving it no
substantial encouragement. In other
words, they have benefited by it
without helping It or even appre
ciating its alms. This is a very
varnished tale regarding the condi
tions with which Mr. Fiske and

The wedding dates of this quartet of
young people have not been determined
upon.
All hail the bride! The groom? O,
he's merely an adjunct â that is, at the
wedding ceremony. But Just wait un
til after the honeymoon. His inning
Â¦will come then, when the shoe will be
on the other foot, and the groom will
be the star performer. For never lived
there a brideâ lest she be a widow,
with knowledge that leadeth to the
contrary â but prows ecstatic over serv
ing her new lord, her new companion,
in a thowsand little ways, if only to
hear the Loved One whisper adoringly.
â¢What a beast I am to let you do this
for me." Ah! That is attar of roses
to the your.g brideâ she who dwelleth
yet at the ape when sacrifice is ador
able. But as the roseate days grlide
by Â«nd the little love-services become
corr.monplare. there often comes a
long, long time between compliments
from' the Loved One. And when here
m this Garden of Eden, where love
deÂ«Â»ds had formerly brought acknowl
edgment, weeds of doubt begin to grow,
]*t the Loved One watch out â for then
there's trouble.
Weeds are troublous things In garden
patches, but they are infinitely more
troublous in the garden of human
hearts than in the pulseless soil. So
grooms, beware! Let not the tender
solicitude of your bride for your hap
piness and comfort go by unnoticed,
for the habit will grow upon you, and
the result will fail far from what you
now would wish It. There is nothing
truer than that, if love should survive
matrimony, it must be nurtured, even
as a sensitive plant doth need the
tun and water.
And â now, dear men-folk, don't get
cross at the statement of an obvious
truthâ it is a fact that the bulk of
commonplaceism in matrimony is at
tributable to you, and, for reasons that
are more or less mitigating, such as
business cares, fatigue, etc. For be it
known that women, be they young
or old, pretty or poetic or common
place, regardless of station, mentality
or development, all are creatures of
sentiment, and amenable to caresses,
kind words and little acts of thought
fulness from him from whom they
have a right to expect it. Now, men
folk, the dearest follows among you
have been guilty of lapsesâ if you
didn't you wouldn't be menâ now and
then, but no choking of the Edenic
garden ensues in a day. The weeds
are tiny, and easily plucked â although
they often tear the hands and inflict
pain in the process.
So, here's to the June husbands! May
they be ever mindful of the joys â as
well as the sorrowsâ that their bonny
brides have brought them, and bear
well in mind that the sorrowsâ as well
as the joysâ are felt equally by the lit
tle women who have promised "to love,
honor and respect" your lordship
< "obey" having become obsolete with
the development of women's clubs) un
til death doth part you. Now, the
truth to tell, don't you think it really
worth while to keep alive the hearth
stone fires with the fuel of love, if for
nothing but to stop the tumult of the
ministers about our diversified divorce
laws? Happy grooms, the affair lies in
your hands â that Is. mostly.

Was ever a time like this for â¢wotxnd
ed hearts, whose lacerations are laid
bare to a gaping world? In almost
every city of consequence in the na
tion some society man is wrapped in the
toils of a breach of promise suit. IrÂ»
most cases the man is old â old enough
to know better, and the maid is youns
â seemingly too young to be skilled in
the fine art of blackmail. But herein
is a phase of the women who sue â
they who find balm in gold. They are
commonly of one type â that of the
adventuress. If, as no doubt some
times happens, a maidenly maid is
forsaken, she is nnt to be found at the
bar of justice, seeking to even scores
with her recreant lover. Far be it
from her to proclaim to the world the
evidences of her lost love. That is
her affair 1 â and the world never hears
of it from her.
Time was when a discussion of ill

might go further, if I cared to quote
from conversations of some appar

fulfill their allotment of duty? It's
distinctly vulgar, stupid, and depress

Besides, It encourages the hypochon
driac to live onâ just to talk over his
woes. That pleasure denied him, he
would die outright â and the world
would be well rid of him, as of all

"The leading military authorities here
expect the early fall of Port Arthur,
and view this as a moat serious If not
an irreparable blow to Russia, the con
dition of Port Arthur being compared
with that of Metz and Sedan during the
Franco-Prussian war. It is pointed out
that General Kuropatkin is making the
same fatal mistake in regard to Port
Arthur's ability to resist that the
French made in connection with Metz.
The military critics without exception
disapprove of Kuropatkin's policy of
non-resistance.
This Is a notable change in French
sentiment since the war began. The

Ypung had 'telephoned to her to meet

Â¦ She dressed herself hurriedly and met
Young. Together, they went to Eighth
avenue and Fifty-ninth street r - and
there took, a cab.
< ,"NAN" . PATTERSON'S STORY.
; "Nan" Patterson, an actress with
whom Young. was infatuated, but to es
cape whose. society it is alleged he was
about to go abroad, was in the cab
with him when, he was shot. She says
the wound which caused Young's death
was Inflicted by himself, but the police
and the District Attorney are not con
vinced that she has told the truth. She
is now in the Tombs, Coroner Brown
having held her without bail pending
an examination, which will begin at
noon on Monday. In all probability
she will be charged with the murder of
Young. ;
Mrs. Young, .who Is a beautiful and
talented woman and who has been
credited by _ her husband with having
lifted "him from a position of poverty
to one of affluence, is at the home of
one of her" sisters in Harlem, heart
broken and in a state of complete phy
sical collapse. Physicians say her rea
son Is In no danger of being shattered,
but that there Is extreme danger of her
death from nerVous and physical ex
haustion. She knew of her husband's
infatuation for the woman who was
with him when he was shot, and it was
to destroy tihs infatuation that she had
persuaded him to go with' her to Eu
rope. She refuses to believe that Young
committed sulcide^and continues to call
for Justice upon his slayer.
THEORIES ARE CONFLICTING.
Those, who have known "Caesar"
Young in the East are inclined to be
lieve that he. shot himself when suf
fering from a fit of temporary insan
ity. But- his relatives and' his most
intimate friends scout the suicide
theory and insist that the Patterson
woman be charged with hjs murder.
John D.Millin, the life long friend and
business partner of Young, met "Nan"
Patterson at the- office of Coroner
Brown, this afternoon and denounced
her as a murderess. Millin could not
restrain -his anger, remembering the at
tempts he had made to Keep Young
from the woman, and had he not been
restrained he would have struck her
down where she stood quailing under
the bitterness of his words. She cried
for protection and later, when sent to
the Tombs, 1 though she' shuddered, she
appeared to be relieved at being cer
tain of at least temporary escape from
Millin's fury.
Everything was in readiness to-day
for the departure of Mr. and Mrs.
Young for Europe. The tickets had
been purchased and most of their bag
gage was . already aboard the Ger
manic. * Young spoke to his friends
about the trip," saying he expected to
enjoy Â¦', himself : and adding that "he
would be glad to get away from the
Patterson woman. ;, .vl$.%.: \
V ACthe police, station â Mrs. Patterson
weptvtiystericallyj-and kissed a postal
card -she said Young ; had j given her in
the-cab,' telling .where to address . let
ters, to him in Europe. , On the reverse
side was her sister's New York address.
j . After I Mrsi j Patterson had been cbm
mltted;to the Tombs; without bail- her
attorney told a' different story.' He said
the; card was by 'Young before
?' Upon examination at *; police head
quarters no, stains or powder marks
were Â« found on -"Nan'/ Patterson's
hands: Stains -were Â¦ found on Young's
hands, ; believed to have been made by
powder. \ A' microscopic test will .'â¢ be
made. ' . ". .'-.'
Â¦Captain Langham of the Detective
Bureau, who; has. -taken charge of the
investigation,', has been told of a num
ber of i threatening j letters received j by
iYoung>ahd; believed to have been sent
by,' a woman. In "those letters. Young
.was -toldÂ» that ' If , tie attempted to leave
New York he would be shot.
: Entering his left . breast the bullet
which i killed him passed between the
first i and second ' ribs, ranged back
ward and slightly downward, cut
through "his left luhgr and finally
lodged In his ;back, after . severing the
fourth spinal vertebrae. His friends,
the police and Assistant District Attor
ney Gans, say. It would have been dif
ficult, though not Impossible, for a
wound such" as this to have been In
flicted upon : , himself "' by Mr. Young.
They also point td the* fact that Mrs.
Patterson says' the revolver was fired
from Young's pocket. . That was not
done. Powder marks on the coat show
where-the. bullet cut through the gar
ment, but there are no powder marks
oh the. coat pocket; It would seem to
have I been impossible for Young to
place, the revolver, where Mrs. Patter
son says - she found â¢. it. The shock of
the' woundV.was paralyzing. Had he
held the revolver when it .was fired it
must have dropped fromhis hand. At
leasts that is 'the, supposition of Cap
tain Sweeney.'
All who have been on terms of inti
macy with "Caesar" Young assert he
was never, known to carry a revolver
and they ask why he*should have arm
ed himself when about to begin a for
eign trip. Mrs. Young said -she got
ready her husband's clothing this
morning and is certain he had no re
volver. â¢ If he had intended to shoot
himself, friends say, he. would not have
stopped to purchase a hat. When his
clothing" was searched in the Hudson
Street\Hospital a roll of bills contain
ing $1820-was found. It is argued that
had he ' been intent upon self destruc
tion hel- would have given the money
to his wife or to < Mrs. Patterson.
'. COURSE OF TIIE BULLET. *
-.That'. Young was infa.tuated with
"Nan" Patterson . there can be. no
doubt. He seemed, to be unable to
.withstand her. blandishments. He was
more, .than generous in his dealings
with her. ' At times his infatuation
became eo intense. that he was crazed.
Twice he â¢ jvas taken . care, of by his
friends until his. wife could reach him.
Mrs._ Young seemed to have an influ
enceup'on him when she was with him
that was even greater than that ex
erted by "Nan" Patterson. So It may
be that he. shot himself while tempo
rarily insane, as a few of his friends
believe.
tian was begun to determine whether
"Caesar:'.. Young was the victim of a
murder. Â¦ â¢

RUSSIANS ARE SKEPTICAL.
Doubt That Japan Has "Made" Over
\ turesjto. Peking Government.
ST. PETERSBURG, June 4.â The
Russian authorities have not been ad
vised by'Lessar, the Russian Minister
to China, of the proposition alleged to
have been made to China by Japan to
hand over the towns captured by. the
Japanese in Manchuria to the Chinese
civil administration, or even of the
refusal of the Peking Government to
assign the administration to a neutral
power. '
The Foreign Office cannot believe
that such a proposition was submitted,
pointing out that while the war is in
progress the fact that certain territory
i3 occupied by the Japanese does not
necessarily mean that It will remain in
their hands. As a belligerent, Russia
would, of course, refuse to recognize
an agreement, which might, hamper
her military operations, and she does
not believe that the powers would
consider even for a moment a proposi
tion of this character. At the con
clusion of the war, if Japan is victori
ous, it is considered that, as. she her
self is under the pledge not to under
take even temporarily the civil ad
ministration of Manchuria, she would
not, be free to "take 'this course.
If Japan has actually opened ne
gotiations with' China on* this subject
it will be regarded here as an attempt
to raise international complications in
the hope > of forcing the : powers fo
interfere .while "the balance of war is
on her side. **â¢ ' ' *

Nevertheless Kuropatkin does not
consider himself strong' enough to risk
the possibility of a defeat which
might be irretrievable and result in
disaster, or at least years of cam
paigning. His friends praise Â¦ his
steady conservatism, caution and re
fusal to listen to the counsel of the
hotspurs.
J Kuropatkin's position' is becoming
.very formidable, both in number and
the character of the troops at his dis
posal. Large reinforcements of field
artillery, in which the Russian army
was especially weak, have ndw arrived.
The War Office's Information does
not indicate that the Japanese have
concentrated for an attack upon Kuro
patkin, and It Is said that they are
not yet ready to assume the offensive.
Nevertheless it is known that differ
ences of opinion exist at the Russian
headquarters as to the advisability of
taking the aggressive, and it is be
lieved that this matter was the. sub
ject of the conference between the
commander in chief and the Viceroy at
Mukden on Tuesday.
The general public at the Russian
capital is imbued with the belief that
important military developments " are
impending at Liaoyang and that a gen
eral engagement between General
Kuropatkln's and General Kuroki's
armies is imminent. Although the au
thorities are doing nothing to discour
age the' idea, the best Informed circles
at the War Office do not expect a de
cisive battlo immediately, ,' unless
brought on' more or less unexpectedly
by an accidental collision between
fetrong columns, as often occurs in war
fare. - â¢-
ST. PETP:RSBUIIG, June 4.â The
Wai- Office has received news of a
t-harp. ilsht - twenty miles ' north " of
Saimatsza, north of Feng\vangcheng,
on June l\ in .which six Cossacks were
killed and 'twenty- two wounded. The
Japanese losse^ are not known. Elve
companies of -General Rennenkampft's
Cossacks discovered Japanese detach
ments at Fenechoulingr Pass, half way
between Saimatsza and AJiudJan. The
Cossacks^ dismounted and attacked' on
foot, but owing" to the difficult nature
of the ground, the strong defensive po
sition held by the enemy and the lat
ter's stubborn 'resistance the attack
was i not pressed and the Cossacka
drew off.\ .
Ko particular importance is attached
at the War Office to the appearance of
this attachment of the enemy, it being
believed that General Kuroki is keep-
Ing his flank well protected in order to
rid himself of the spying eyes of the
Coesacks. .
The War Office has received no fresh
news : from Liaotung. Since the receipt
of General Stoesgel's report the general
staff is convinced that the Japanese
losses in the fighting about Kinchou
were greater than officially admitted.
It is known that only the very serious
ly wounded were included in that cate
gory. There are indications that both
of the commanders are pursuing this
plarf, as the wounds made by the small
caliber, high velocity bullets used in
modern warfare, unless they reach a
vital spot, heal quickly, and in a
few weeks most of the wounded men
are again ready for active service.

Shortly after Millin made this state

to be taken to the Coroner's office.

when he gaw her. He started at her
with a rush. She shrank back against
a detective. Millin again rushed at her.
but two or three detectives grabbed
him and held him until the woman
was ought of sight. Millin shouted
at her as she left the station-house.
The woman was taken to Coroner
Brown's private office and closeled
with him. . While there Millin ap
peared. He tried to break into the
room and get at the woman again,
but was prevented. He called the
woman names and shouted he would
kill her if he had a weapon.
Young was an Englishman by birth.
He was brought to this country in 1S90
by the old Manhattan Club as a repre
sentative amateur athlete of England.
Young several years ago purchased
race horses, 'one of them being Eonic,
which won the Burns handicap, one
of the big stake faces in California.
Mrs. Young, then a bride, trained the
horse and nearly $50,000 was won by
the couple on the race. Young brought
a string of horses East with him when
he came here about a month ago.
The most noted of them are Cunard
and Watercure.
The dead man was known on the
race tracks as Caesar Young, but his
correct name was Frank Thomas
Young.
Not until she had reached the home
of her sister did Mrs. Young know she
had been widowed. Her grief was piti
able. â¢
It was announced to-night that Mrs.
Young's condition is critical and that
only the greatest care can possibly save
her life. Her cry is for her husband
to return to her. This is varied occa
sionally by hysterical denunciation of
the Patterson woman.
The scene in the Coroner's office
when John Millin denounced "Nan"
Patterson as a murderess was highly
sensational. Millin said Young never
carried a revolver and that he did not
belief the death was due to a self
inflicted wound. He said that Young,
who came here from England ten or
fifteen years affo a poor man, was^
worth more than a half million dol
lars.
The news of the husband's death had
been told the -wife as gently as possi
ble. She had waited anxiously at the
pier and seemed to have a premonition
of trouble. She told her friends she
hoped the ' Patterson woman had not
again been able to reaoh Young.
Finally the Germanic sailed., Mrs.
Young was hysterical. Her sisters,
though deeply shocked upon being pri
vately told of Young's death, kept the
news from Mrs. Young, telling her th,at
her husband was detained as the result
of legal troubles. â¢

WIDOW'S PITIABLE GRIEF.
When Youns went north the woman
went als.o, and he established her in
San Francisco, while he went to his
home In Emeryville. During the recent
race meeting at Ascot Park the woman
appeared here In advance of Young,
and soon after he came here he dropped
out of sight. The woman also disap
peared, and It was reported that he
had left for the Cast with her. He
subsequently reappeared, as did Miss
"Randolph." for throughout the time
that she has known him she has kept
as closely to him as possible. Their re
lations here were notorious and Young
was warned repeatedly by friends to
be careful, but* he resented all such ad
vice, replying that he was old enough
to look out f(?r himself, and it was no
body's business what he did. The
couple participated In numerous wild
larks, but It was invariably noticed
that the woman kept her head and was
able at all times to seemingly dominate
Young. Fearing his displeasure, his
friends refrained from offering him
advice, and Miss "Randolph" did about
as she pleased with him. To those In
Los Angeles who knew of their es
capades here the news of the tragedy in
New' York did not come as a surprise.
John Millin knows more about their
relations than any other living person,
because he was the one man who stood
boldly out against the woman and tried
to induce Young to sever his relations
with her.
as she saw richer financial pickings
among'! the horsemen then here at the
race meeting at Agricultural Park. She
was known here as Nan Randolph, but
names did not worry her, and to vari
ous admirers she gave various names.
John Mlllln and Caesar Young were
making books at the Agricultural Park
meeting, and Mlllin met the woman and
is said to have Immediately displaced
In her "affections" the man who had
brought her to this city. She soon
learned that Young was the moneyed
man of -the Millin-Young combination,
and she grew frigid toward Millln and
sought an Introduction to Young. That
having been accomplished, she was
with Young whenever an opportunity
offered. She â¢ appeared to wield an
amaz&g influence over Young. He paid
for her apartments and all her other
expenses, and showered expensive gifts
upon her. The pace they set was a fast
one, and Young soon began to neglect
his business for the woman. He drank
to excess, and with certain hackmen he
left standing orders that when he had
to be cared for he was to be taken to
the woman's apartments.
Those of the sporting set in Los An
geles who knew both Young and the
woman blame.her for Young's down
fall and declared that she had been
heard to say, "Young is so easy it's a
shame to take the money." but she
continued to take it. and nobody will
ever know how much Young lavished
upon her. . Â«.

XEW YORK. June 4.â It would be
difficult to find a stock ln the active
list which Bhows a change of as much
as a point from the last price of Fri
day of last week, when dealings were
euspended for the three days' holiday
which followed. Gains and losses are
ir.ixpd. Prices have not been very far
from the level of a week ago at any
time, but the light selling of the early
part of the week was followed by
equally light covering of ehorts j'ester
cay and to-day, thus practically oblit
erating the week's changes. The mar
ket is entirely unaffected by news. The
bank statement did not reflect .all of
the expected gain in cash, and the loan
contraction was not as large as ex
pected. But Wall street has been draw-
Ing unfavorable Inferences rather than
otherwise from the accumulation of
idle bank reserves, so that the motive
for the days* stagnation can hardly be
attributed to this cause. The closing
was virtually stagnant. Total sales of
bonds, par value. $343,000.
The average level of the stock mar
ket hr.s been practically immovable
this week, the thr^e days' holiday in
terval developing nothing to lift it out
of the rut into which it has fallen.
There were some exceptions among a
nurnKer of low-grade, non-dividend
jayins stocks, and, at the other ex
treme, fome of the high-grade invest
ment stocks. The usually active stocks.
of which the floating supply in the
:narket is large and whose movements
.isually reilect the' current of specu
lative sentiment, have lain almost dor
mant. The drop in low-grade stocks
was regarded as an adjustment of
Jong-standing discrepancies brought
about by former manipulative tactics
by pools in these stocks and maintain
ed with comparative ease owing to the
Mna'.l outstanding supply of these is-
Mies. The abandonment of support -of
these stocks or the fear of Its abandon
ment led to ?ome selling by suspicious
followers of the former movement in
them and their prompt yielding to the
lovrer price level. The vulnerability of
the high-grade Investment stocks to
light liquidation is evidence of the
deaith of investment demand in the
market tn take up such offerings. Any
ihin; like forced liquidations makes
quick inroads on values in any part of
the list. Owing to the extreme ease
<:f the money market, however, there
Is very little of such liquidation.
Gold has continued to go out in mod
erate amount from Xew York, but re
ceipts of Japanese gold at San Fran
cisco have also continued. Money re
"mains extremely easy in New York,
with reserves piling up further in the
banks, and no obstacle is offered to
the ?old outgo by an advance in inter
est rates.
KEW YORK, June 4. â The Finan
cier says: The most notable features
of the official statement of the Xew
York Aesoc'ated Banks for the five
days of the week, Monday being a hol
iday, were the further liquidation in
loans, the moderate net -Increase in
cash, notwithstanding the estimated
large gain as ehown by the traceable
movements of money, the quite small
decrease in general deposits and a
further Increase in surplus reserve.
The loans were reduced $3,918,200,
making a liquidation ln this item of
$42,263,400 in the three weeks since
May 14. The greater part of this re
duptlon in- loans which was effected
during the fortnight ending, the pre
vious week, was due, as has been
heretofore stated, to the cancellation
of loans of public deposits which were
surrendered to the treasury. The
further liquidation last week seems
to have been caused by the
indisposition of borrowers to make
new engagements even at the low
rates for time money ruling in the
market. The cash gain for the week
was only J2, 029.900 net, whereas the
estimates almost unmistakably showed
an Increase of J 8,780.700. As the dis
crepancy is otherwise inexplainable it
may be regarded as due to the average
system. The general deposits' de
creased only $164,600, or $1,723,700
below the sum of the reduction ln
loans, lees the net gain ln cash, and
therefore the statement failed to make
a good balance. â¢

Then two \-erdictÂ«, one of guilty and
the. other suggesting acquittal, were
handed to the clerk, but neither slip of
paper was signed. So the twelve good
and- true were ordered to return to col
lective seclusion and try it over again.
This they did,, thus closing Incident
No. 2.
Again came the. signal of readiness to
report, and again the twelve were es
corted to their box. Their verdict wu
"guilty" and unanimous. Colonel Ko
walsky then announced his Intention to
demand a rstrial on obvious grounds,
and the Judge set Tuesday aa the date
for hearing arguments â¢ on the motion.
Thus closed incident No. 3.
For doing unto Joseph Lioynd as Jos
eph Loynd had done unto him, . John
O'Connor received a blow upon his jaw
from Joseph Loynd's fist. Then, In
stead of continuing bis retaliation in
kind, John O'Connor had Joseph Loynd
arrested for "battery.
Mr. O'Connor was mating breakfast
and reading the latest -wirings from the
disturbed Orient when the newspaper
was rudely snatched from before his
eyes by Mr. Loynd, who took It to an
adjoining table' and perused lfaa he
ate. He was deeply immersed In the
tidings from the Talu when the Jour
nal was plucked away from his vision
by Mr. O'Connor, and then he arose
and administered the blow upon the
Jaw.
Judge Mogan fined Mr. Loynd $5.

William Burns, an ex-fireman, turned
in a false alarm from the box at Eddy
and Taylor streets and he could not
explain to Judge Cabaniss Just what
prompted him to do such a silly thing.
He will be sentenced Tuesday for ma
licious mischief.
Mrs. Anna Speakman. charged with
attempting to murder Mrs. Clara Le
fevre by slashing her head and face
with a carving knife about three weeks
ago, was ready for trial yesterday In
Judge Mogan's court, but the prosecu
tion obtained a continuance for a week,
by which time Mrs. Lefevre's physician
may allow her to appear in court.
Mrs. F. W. Hobson was riding on the
rear platform of a, Powell street car
when she saw John Doe Coughlin
whipping a small horse that with two
larger animals was attached to a
wagon laden heavily with furniture.
Mrs. E. Fletcher was sitting In her
apartment at Powell and Pine streets
when she was attracted to the window
by the cracking of a whip- and the
stumbling of .horses on the street, and
she also saw Cpughlfn>e"atlng the little
horse. Both ladles telepnoned to Sec
retary Holbrobk of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and
he had Coughlin'arrested.
Mrs. Hobson and Mrs. Fletcher ap
peared In Judge Fritz's fcourt and tes
tified in detail' that Coughlin had most
cruelly lashed the horse, a compara
tively unbroken animal, because It
balked at hauling the heavy load down
a steep hilL Blood was trickling from
a., cut over one of its eyes and one of
Its ears also bled. The .two Jadles had
never met each other and each notified
Secretary Holbrook without knowing
that the other had done or was going
to do so. Mrs. Hobson's eyes were
moist as she described the affair. Sev
eral witnesses testified for the defense
and the case was continued to enable
the attorney to subpena others.
Noah "^Tarwick, an artilleryman, tall
and stalwart, was before Judge Cab
aniss on the charge of cutting the neck
of George Woodward, another warrior,
with a pocketknife early yesterday
morning on the Barbary Coast. Wood
ward and a comrade met Warwick on
the 500 block of Pacific street and
Woodwar# addressed an opprobrious
epithet to Warwick, who, thereupon,,
stabbed him. Inflicting a slight wound.
The charge is assault to murder and it
â¢will be heard more fully next Tues
day.
Albert Flick and James Rodel, mes
senger boys, were simply playing "tlc
tac-toc," when they v happened to break
a glass panel in the door of a Sutter
street fruit store last -Wednesday night
and were subsequently arrested and
charged with burglary. In the posses
sion of one of the lads was j jund a
"tic-tac-toc" implement, consisting of
a piece of string with a bit of leather
attached to the end of It and It was
proved that they had spent about
twenty minutes playing the gamp be
fore the glass was broken.
"And I'll venture the assertion,"
said Judge Mogan to the defendants,
"that while you played 'tic-tac-toc' a
'rush* message was in your pocket.
However, you are not formally charg
ed with loitering, but with burglary,
and that charge is dismissed."
i. Ralph Sloan had a bundle of lottery
tickets in brie of his pockets when he
was arrested on . Market . street and
searched. Judge Mogan gave him the

In the wake of the queen's retinue
came the floats arid heralds, the chil

Among .the shows the one deserving
special mention was the stadium, where

with these unprofitable rates the city
requirements would have amounted to

was made for the sum of $300,000.

In the best practice match of the
day Frank Mitchell and Herbert Long
won from Charles G. Kuehn and Carl
Gardner in two straight sets. ."While
the tennis was not particularly high
class, both sets were extremely close
and each team had a chance until the
last point had been won.
The scores follow: F. Mitchell and
H. Long beat C. G. Kuehn and C.
Gardner, 6-4,- 12-10; M. Long beat Dr.
Lovegrove, 6-1, 6-1; H. Haight beat
R. B. Cornell, 6-1, 6-3; J. D. Mac-
Gavin beat C. Gardner, 6-4, 6^-3;
Pritchard beat O'Hara, 6-2, 6-0/6-1:
Pritchard and Spring â¢ beat O'Hara
and Green, 6-2, 7-5, 6-4.
One tournament match was played
during the day. In it Melville Long
easily defeated Dr. Lovegrove in two
straight sets. This match was to de
termine who should meet G. M. Guerln
In the final of the fourth class tourna
ment, which was started on the courts
ln Golden Gate Park three weeks ago.
Long and Guerin are both credited
with two wins of the handsome three
time cup, consequently one of them
will gain it permanently by to-day's
match.
It seems likely the match for the
tennis championship of San Francisco,
which Is scheduled for to-day, will.be
postponed. Percy Murdock, who is to
meet Champion MacGavin in the chal
lenge match, has been ill for two days
past and unless there is marked im
provement ln his condition it will be
necessary to postpone the match.
The courts of the California Club
were deserted yesterday, owing. to the
hot weather. A few of the more en
thusiastic were on hand, however, and
managed to play through two or three
sets, which, as a rule, were slow.

MAC'S LUCK
TIjp Vounjr Woman Reporter's Story.
The following food tale written by a
clever young newspaper woman Is a
true story that came under her per-
*onal observation:
"I have been with the (a paper in
a California town) for nine years and
Mac has been with us all that time and
I do not knew how much longer. Mac's
full name is MacCleHan. Before the lin-
otypes came in he was a good printer,
and was one of the first to learn the
machine, and is now, at about the ape
of 42, one of our very fastest operators.
"Last winter and the winter before
Mac. probably from constant night
work and improper food, got badly run
down, could not feat much, what little
he did t-at did not do him much good
and he always complained he could not
keep warm.
"I mifised him for a while until yester-
day I overtook him on the street going
toward the office, and hardly knew the
jnan: had It not beeji for the familiar
v-ulk I should eurely have passed with-
out recognizing him. He was stout, his
face w as round and ruddy and his eyeg
b: ipht as I had never Been them before.
"I rrJd, 'Mac, I' hardly knew you;
what on earth have you been doing
;Â¦â¢ t ',-ct so fat?' He replied, 'Orape-
JCuts. nothing else. I started in on
Grape -Nuts food three months ago
when I â¢neighed 128 and was feeling
miserable, but now I weigh 160 and feel
better than I ever felt ln my life. I
quit my old diet and went on Grape-
Nuts and that's the whole story.' "

Exercise Is necessary, but there's no
nourishment in It and proper food
alone can supply that. Grape-Nuts for

big things.

Congratulatory Speeches on the Great
Success of Last Monday's Games â
Presentation to Tevendale.
The Caledonian Club held an en
thusiastic meeting In Scottish Hall
Friday night and discussed the great
success, financially and otherwise, of
the annual gathering and games at
Shell Mound Park last Monday. Chief
A. U. Macpherson announced that the
attendance had been much larger than
for many years back, resulting in a
financial gain to the club more than
double that of th"e previous year. Con
gratulatory speeches were delivered
by the officers of the club and others.
A pleasing ceremony was performed
by Chief MacPherson in the presenta
tion of a gold-headed cane and valu
able pipe to Piper I. S. R. Tevendale
on behalf on his fellow pipers. Teven
dale leaves this evening for a visit to
Scotland. At the request**of John D.
McGilvray, donor of the gold medal,
valued at $250, for the best player
of the bagpipes at the annual games,
Tevendale was authorized to take the
medal with him, as he has now won
It two years in succession. - '

People of San Francisco and Vicinity
It was a good thing for the eoda
fountains, the steam beer emporiums
and the laundrjmen to have the kind
of weather that Professor McAdie
handed to San Francisco yesterdaj*,
but the rest of us would respectfully
request him to be a little more lenient
In the future. The mercury went up
to 90 degrees at 2 o'clock in the after
noon and McAdle's thermometer Is a
cool one at that.
The hot wave was peculiar from a
meteorological standpoint, in that it
moved from south to north. It was
caused by the existence of an area of
high pressure to the northeast of San
Francisco. The weather to-day Is
likely to be cooler.
The thermometer registered 96 de
grees on June 6 of last year. The hot
test June day in the history of the lo
cal Weather Bureau was the next to
the last day of the month in 1891,
when the temperature was 100 degrees
above zero.
Yesterday was the hottest day so far
this year. ' Â¦â¢â¢ "

Ancient Millionaires.
A writer in a Jewish magazine has
been looking into the Agadic history of
the Talmud, and believes that there
were richer men before the Christian
era than there are now. We know that
Croesus was rich, and that there were
huge Roman fortunes in the times of
the empire. The Talmud stories go
back further still. The great corner
in corn that Joseph â¢manage^was fabu
lously profitable. Tradition says that
Joseph, acting for Pharaoh, got his
hands on pretty much all the ready
money there was in his day, and buried
three enorgmous treasures, one of
which was found by Korah, whose for
tune, estimated according to the mod
ern standards of value, is rated by the
magazine at three billion dollars. Solo

Although California is the land of
flowers to which snowballing, except in
the mountains, generally is forbidden,
exceptions to the rule may be com
pelled. Such an exception, during the
past winter, or rainy season, was wit
nessed in San Jose. One of the stage
drivers to and from Mount Hamilton
brought from there a barrel carefully
packed with snow, and presented It to
the pupils of the Câ ;nt school in^the
Garden City. Then the fun began.
Most of the children had not seen
snow before except on the distant
mountain summits. They wanted to
snowball, but they didn't know how,
and they approached the problem ten
tatively. Andâ here is the crowning
absurdity of the situation â some of
their teachers didn't know how to
teach them; although they were adults,
never before had they come In con
tact with snow. Some of the little
chaps, after cautious Investigation, de
clared that the strange white stuff
burned their fingers, it was so- hot, and
others, who had read or been told
about it, feared that their hands
would be frozen by the first contact
with it. The experimental stage soon
was past, however, and then the fun
was fast and - furious. It was such
ecstasy as Eastern children know, with
the zest of novelty added to It. For a
brief time school traditions . and the
proprieties maintained between i teach
ers and pupils were thrown to the
winds, and there was none so highor
so low that a snowball might not batter
him when least expected. The White
missiles whizzed through bushes laden
with roses or" clipped the stately calla
lilies from their stems as a knife might
have done. It was a touch of winter

IN a recent report to the Department of Commerce
and Labor at Washington, A. M. Thackara, United
States Consul at Havre, France, sounds a note of warn
ing for our California prune exporters. He declares that
the recent greatly increased sale of prunes abroad has re
sulted in fraudulent methods of trade on the_ part of
unscrupulous fruit packers, which have served to under
mine the confidence of French importers of pur prunes
and to bring the price of the best products down to the
level of the, spurious qualities 5 that are shipped abroad
under false labels and iiv unfair weights. ; V
"A serious abuse which has crept into the trade," says
Consul Thackara, "is the. selling and branding as Santa
Clara prunes fruit which is grown in other districts.
This fruit is of inferior quality and can be purchased
for considerably less than the genuine Santa Clara
product. The difficulty of detecting the fraud has facili
tated this dishonest trade, but the result will undoubtedly
be that Santa Clara district will not only lose its repu
tation but also the premium which its prunes , have
hitherto commanded." â¢
This warning of our Consul should demand the imme
diate attention of all our prune growers who desire to
hold to the very successful market which they have
established for their product in France. Not only has
the Santa Clara prune already forced itself into strong
competition, with the French fruit in our markets,' but
in the land of the French prune itself the California
product is becoming a t dangerous rival. During the year
1903, 524,413 boxes of California prunes were imported
into Havre; up to March 20, the date of Consul Thack
afa's report," 285,009 boxes mark the trade of the first
few months' of this year at that port. Such favorable
aspects of trade should v not be allowed to be'blighted
b/the methods of unscrupulous packers here.
As was the expedient of the New York cheese makers
whose brands were being used on inferior products
of tH"e> Middle Weit, Santa Clara prune packers should
appeal for a careful system of inspection and proper
labeling of all dried prunes shipped out. of California,
in order that their fruits may not be cheapened by
inferior imitations flooding the foreign ; market. . Â¦ S*hould
the Santa; Clara producers : be able { to detect ;the parties
responsible for the fraud speedy legal proceedings should
be employed by them in , order that their label may con
tinue to be the guarantee^ of high value in the markets
of France. Thc^ continued success- of their trade with
foreign* markets depends upon speedy and efficient reme
dial measures. ; . :

At the Villa di Quarto Mr. Clemens'
daughters take long rides under the
shade of the great old trees that over
hang the broad and easyjroads. They
are both accomplished v and ardent
horsewomen. Miss Jean has recently
bought a superb white horse. Her sis
ter. Miss Clara, has a beautiful v'oice,
and sings 'with exquisite grace. On
the 8th of April she took part in a con
cert given by the Philharmonic Society
of Florence, and made a deep impres
sion on the audience. The possession
of two such daughters Is a great com
fort to Mr. Clemens. They go every
where with him, surround him with
affectionate attentions and take a gentle
and tender care of him. Miss Jean,
for Instance, helps her father not a
little with his daily work. When he
does not dictate, he leaves little sheets
of manuscript scattered everywhere; it
is Miss Jean's task to collect and ar
range them and then to copy them on
the typewriter. Mark Twain's cor
respondence is naturally very large. A
man is employed to go into Florence
twice a day to bring the mail, and
always returns loaded down with let
ters, papers and books.
It Is uncertain how long the famous
humorist will remain in Italy. His
lease of the Villa di Quarto is only for
a year, but Eignora Marsili, the owner,
thinks that he will renew it when it
expires, since he Is so well and com
fortable In Florence, ana since his
wife's health has already shown a
marked improvement. i--l/',
Mrs.. Clemens, his faithful companion
for twenty-five years, unlike her hus
band, is an enthusiastic student of the
masterpieces of art 'and of historical
associations. Mark Twain has his own
ideas about art, which are a subject of
frequent controversy with his wife.

How a Spider Thinks.
If you anchor a pole In a body of
water, leaving the pole Above the sur
face, and put a spider upon it, he will
exhibit a marvelous intelligence by hla
plans to escape. At first he will t-pin
a web several inches long and har.3
to one end while he allows the other
to float off in the wind. In the hope
that it will strike some object. Of
course, this plan proves a failure. Ho
waits until the wind shifts, perhaps,
and then sends another silken brMss
floating off in another direction. An
other failure is followed by several
other similar attempts, until all tha
points of the compass have been tried.
But neither the resources nor the rea
soning powers of the spider are ex
hausted. He climbs to the top of the
pole and energetically goes to work to
construct a silken balloon. He has no
hot air with which to inflate it, but ha
has the power of making it buoyant.
When he gets his balloon finished ha
does not go off upon the mere suppo
sition that it will carry him, as men
often do. but he fastens it to a, euy
rope, the other end of which he at
taches to the island po!e upon which
he is a prisoner. He then gets Into his
aerial vehicle, while it is made fast,
and tests it to see whether its dimen
sionse are capable of bearing him
away. He sometimes finds that he has
made it too small, in which case ha
hauls it down, takes It all apart, and
constructs It on a larger and better
plan. A spider has been seen to maka
three different balloons before he be
came satisfied with his experiment.
Then he will get in, snap his guy-rope,
and sail away to land as gracefully and
as supremely independent of his sur
roundings as could well be imagined. â

THE plans for Portland's. Lewis and Clark Centen
nial Exposition are developing into tangible shape
and are already in such condition as to justify the
statement that the fair will not only be creditable, but
with the exception of '.he great Qhicago and St. Louis
fairs, will be one of the largest and finest ever held in
this country. It will open in just about a year, that is,
on June I, 1905. Like our own Midwinter Fair, follow
ing as it did the Chicago exhibition, the Portland fair
will have the advantage of following the St. Louis Ex
position, and will thus profit by obtaining many of the
exhibits that will h-ive been shown, there.
The Lewis and Clark Exposition will represent an
outlay of about $5,000,000, which amount will cover the
expense of laying out the grounds, construction of build
ings and installing exhibits. The United States Govern
ment has appropriated $475,000 and will have an exhibit
valued at over $300,000 more. Oregon alone has appro
priated $450,000, which is at the fate of. about $1 per
capita for each of her inhabitants.
California, Montana, Utah and Idaho h'ave already ap
propriated money, and Nevada, Colorado and Arizona
have exhibits ready, and only await legislative % appro
priation for transportation and maintenance, ' Missouri,
Minnesota and North Dakota have set aside a fund to
send their St. Louis exhibits to Portland, while Kansas,
Nebraska and South Dakota arc awaiting action by their
Legislatures to enable them to do' likewise. New York
and Massachusetts havetalso made appropriations.
Every one living on this coast should take pride in
seeing Portland's effort a success. .There is and should
be a fealty existing between California and the adjacent
States which it is well to foster. We have, with them,
many interests in common and the building up of one
locality tends fo the prosperity of those near at hand.
San Francisco in particular should take an active inter
est in the matter. Professional tourists, strangers gen
erally, and the inhabitants of other States, will be at
tracted to this coast jsidio would not "otherwise come,
and they, will not be likely to leave without paying a
visit to the metropolis. Aside from that fact, . however,
we_ owe to Portland the moral and material support
which should prevail between good neighbors. We
should aid her in presenting the best side to visitors at
her reception, and to that end should send of our fruits,
flowers and many other good things. In" short we must
recognize the fact that so far as the East is concerned
the exposition will be known as a Pacific Coast enter
prise, and the whole Pacific Coast will profit by the credit
of it.

GARDENS. LONDON, May 26.âJac
cues Le Lorrain, whose tragedy. "Don
Quichotte," was produced successfully
in Paris a few nights ago, has had
rather a picturesque career. A year or
two ago, Mr. Le Lorrain, who previous
ly had attracted some attention by his
literary efforts, distinguished himself
by starting in business as a cobbler, or
ehoemaker. Le Lorrain's father had
been a cobbler, but his son tried his
hand at this trade only because, though
his writings had brought him some
fame, they had not produced bread
and-butter with the regularity that
would have been desirable. The ex-
Trriter*s cobbling ehop was in the Rue
du Sommerard, and he advertised It
widely In verses of his own composi
tion. Le Lorrain also wrote letters to
the Paris newspapers, in which he com
pared himself with Spinoza, who made
epectacles for a v living, while he laid
the foundations of his great philosoph
ical works. But the trouble was that
the amateur cobbler was only an indif
ferent workman in that line, and the
things he did to their shoes speedily
drove away such customers as his
verses attracted. So Le Lorrain de
cided not to "stick to his last." He
closed his cobbler's snop and became
a schoolmaster, and it was while fol
lowing that calling that he wrote the
drama which has just been put on the
stage.
George Newr.es & Co., who publish
Tit-Bits, as well as the Strand Maga
zine, got back at W. L. Courtney, the
distinguished critic and editor of the
Fortnightly Review, rather neatly the
Other day. Speaking on the subject qf
literature at the Institute of Painters
recently, Mr. Courtney said: "Could
any of our'children read those leisurely
romances of Scott? Would they not
return 'Peveril of the Peak* with a de-
Eire to read something published by â
I speak with all respect of a famous
firmâ Messrs. George Xewnes?" Un
doubtedly Mr. Courtney referred to Tit-
Bits, or a certain class of cheap novels
of which Messrs, Newnes make a spe
cialty. It happens, however, that these
publishers also issue a thin paper edi
tion of Milton, Shakespeare, Words
worth and other classics, and â affecting
to misunderstand the critic's meaning
â on the day after Mr. Courtney's
speech the publishers quoted his re
mark in all their advertisements, with
the list of these works underneath it.
They believe in honoring their great
men on the Continent. It was not so
long ago that the town of Nuremberg
bought, in order to preserve it, the
birthplace of Albert Durer, the artist,
and now the municipality hopes to ac
quire the old home of Hans Sachs,
poet, roelstersinger and shoemaker.
The house, which for many years was

over, will hold Its annual meeting out
side Europe this year. Arrangements
are now in progress by which "at least
200 members of the society will, under
the presidency of Sir William Ramsay,
K. C. B,, of radium fame, proceed to
America early in September next They
will reach New York on September 6
and on the 7th they will be received
by the Chemists' Club of that city.
The society's annual meeting will be
held on the Sth at Columbia University,
and in the .evening the annual dinner
will take place at the Waldorf-Astoria.
The members will/remain in New York
and vicinity for four days visiting all
the works of Importance in connection
with their particular branch of indus
try. They will afterward proceed to
Philadelphia, Washington and Pitts
burg. They expect to reach St. Louis
on September 18, where they will re
main a week attending the Inter
national Chemical Congress in the
meantime. They will afterward visit
Chicago, Detroit, Niagara Falls and
Buffalo, returning by way of Bostonâ
where they will spend two days â to
Xew York. A number of ladles inter
ested In chemical science will accom
pany the members and they will be es
pecially provided for by Mrs. Charles
E. Pellew, under whose direction a
committee will be formed in New York.
Some of the most eminent men in

society; Dr. Joseph W. Swan, F. R. S.,
and Max Muspratt are going out to the
meeting.
A Judicial Jokester.
Off the bench Superior Judge Frank
Murasky is not the staid and quiet in
dividual his demeanor on the bench
would indicate. He is quite a joker at
times, as is evidenced by the following:
A few nights ago Attorney Frank
Kierce happened to be out quite' late.
As he was "waiting for' the last car
a weli-known insurance man, home
ward bound also, asked him into a
near-by resort to have a â¢â¢night-cap."
Well, they had the "night-cap" and
missed the* last car, and as a result,
remained in the place for quite a little
while talking over various topics. Now,
the Insurance man is well' known for
his habit at certain times of fingering
the watch chain of the person to whom
he is talking, so during the entire con
versation Kierce made no objection
when his friend accentuated hia re
marks with numerous vigorous tugs at
his watch fob. /
Judge Murasky' heard of the late ses
sion the next day, and being well ac
quainted with the lawyer and the in
surance man, saw a chance to have a
little fun. He went to a telephone and
called up the insurance man. When
the latter answered, the Judge said:
"Hello. 'This is Kierce. Â«itow about
my watch?"
"Your watch?" came in a surprised
tone of voice from the insurance man.
"I know nothing about your watch."
"That's strange," said the pseudo
Kierce. "You took it out or my pocket
last night while we were talking and
I forsot to ask you for it when we
parted because I thought you would
send it to me the next morning. It's
not a very valuable timepiece, but I
regard it highly because it is an heir
loom. Just take a look through your
clothes when you go home."
Well, to make a long story short the
insurance man looked through every
pocket in every suit of clothes he had
at home. He searched his house from
top to bottom, but could not find the
watch, and he so told Judge Murasky,
still posing as Kierce, when he called
up the next day, and the next.
The affair worried the insurance, man
considerably, and he began to wonder
what he could do to placate the evi
dently very angry Kierce. A thought
struck him, and he immediately called
up the lawyer.
"Hello, Kierce," he said over the
phone, "this Is Blank. I wish you
would come right down to my office.
I have a big suit here I want you to
handle." And then -as he hung up the
phone, he remarked sotto voce, "that
ought to square matters."
Kierce appeared at the office in a
very few- minutes, greatly pleased, for
the suit promised a laVge fee.
Very, nervously .the insurance man
greeted him., and' he lost no time In
giving the attorney all the facts con
nected .with the suit. The attorney
made copious notes during the conver
sation, leaving his friend biting his
nails and squirming about in his chair,
hoping almost gainst hope that the
subject of the watch would not be
brought up. It w-as not and Blank
breathed a sigh of relief when Kierce
rose from his chair and reached for
his hat.
Then he almost fainted as Kierce
asked him what time it was, saying, as
he did so, "I am dug 1 at the City Hall at
4 and my watch
"It's a quarter of 4," almost yelled
Blank, taking the time from a large
clock on the wall."
"I have . ample time," said Kierce,
unbuttoning his coat and taking a
watch from his vest pocket. "My
watch is a little bit slow."
"Your watch," gasped the insurance
man, "when did you get it?" :
â¢ Explanations, of course, followed and
the pair started out on a still hunt for
the man who did the phoning. The
first person they met was Judge SIu
rasky and the*guilty grin on the latter's
face ended the search. ,'â¢>;. r.^

HAYDEN CHURCH.
. t-v UBLIC POLICY, the ablest of American publica-
Iâ*' tions devoted to the discussion of economics, re
â¢*Â¦ produces The Call's recent editorial on the report
of Mr. Priestly, the superintendent of East Indian rail
ways, on Anierican roads, and also an editorial on the
same subject from the Wall-street Journal. -
The Journal concedes the justice of all that Mr. Priest
ly says about the enterprise and genius of American
railway management, which'has succeeded in giving the
best and cheapest service, while paying the highest
wages in the world. But the Journal says: "As regards
the relations of the railroads to the rights of the public
a notable lack of, wisdom and frankness has been dis
played. Speaking broadly, they have fought every inch
of the way in an effort to prevent publicity and reason
able governmental supervision of the railroads. They
have generally failed to appreciate the difference between
stupid and partisan anti-railroad agitation and an in
telligent insistence upon public rights. ;The railroad
managers have seemed to include both the political agi
tators and the economic critics of the railroads in the
same clas6. and to have presented a constant -antagon
ism to both."
By way of proof and specification the Journal says
that: "A retired railroad official, who some years ago
was at the head of one of the great American" systems,
his name known from' the Atlantic to the Pacific, but
who is now peacefully engaged in the pursuit of farm
ing, spoke of the change in the .point of view which his
retirement from the railroad business had brought about.
He is now in the position of a shipper of freight, not a
transporter, not a maker of rates. He spoke of some of
the annoyances to which he -has been subjected by the
railroads over which he has to ship his goods, of the
difficulty of bringing his complaints to the high officials
of the company and of obtaining redress for such wrongs
and losses as he had suciained." _^
This reminds us of a reported experience of the late
Senator Stanford when he was president of the Central
and Southern Pacific roads. In the operation of his
large private estate at Vina in Tehama .County, it be
came necessary to ship to that point on his railroad a
large quantity of freight. He had to go to the freight
department for cars, classification and rates, and en
countered so many difficulties that he finally revolted
and ordered flatboats built to carry his freight up the
river in tow of a tugboat. The sequel to the story is that
thereafter no buliness man appealed to him in vain for
redress in any issue caused by the policy of his roads.
As to the other branch of -the Journal's article, resist
ance to economic and partisan agitation alike, we must,
in fairness, partly excuse it. The economic critics of
the American roads admit that if all the partisan propo
sitions for legislation against the roads became the law
it would be impossible to operate the roads at all. Very
naturally the railway managers /treat every proposition
to legislate as the entering wedge for measures that so
impair their control of their property that first it will
cease to be profitable to its owners' and finally will *be
crippled as a public convenience and necessity. When
the latter happens the agitators who have brought it
about stand ready to charge it not to the ignorant "and
defective legislation they have' secured, but to the con
tumacy of the railroads. Then they will demand more
legislation of the same kind and increase a difficulty for
which they and not the railroads are responsible.
From our point of view it is desirable as much as pos
sible to avoid political action by legislation. The econo
mic critics of railway management should be encouraged
to address themselves tc that management only. If the
reforms they propose are valid, if they bring the roads
and the public interest more at one, if they facilitate
rather than impair. the operation of the roads as a quasi
public agency, then they should be adopted by the roads
without waiting for or requiring legislation. In this way
the agitator and economist will be differentiated. It
goes without saying that the greatest cause of public
complaint will be removed by the roads furnishing a
prompt access to some place of authority to patiently
hear and justly decide the grievances of shippers. The
experience of the retired railroad official is' very sugges
tive on that point. He undoubtedly knows that railroad
business cannot be exempt from the incidental disagree
ments that are found in all business. They require set
tlement before they degenerate into a grudge. When
they reach the grudge state then those who suffer them
naturally gravitate to the side of the partisan, demagogue
anti-railroad agitator.
In this State we have pioneered in the matter of get
ting the people and the railroad together. After wasting
many years upon all sorts of fantastic legislative propo
sitions, it has become the practice of the departmental
managers of our railroads and the producers and ship
pers to get together and without heat or recrimination
discuss the issues that arise between them. Examples
of this are seen in the meetings between the citrus fruit
men and the railroads to discuss their mutual interests.
The citrus men do not always /get all they want, but
they feel that they have, been heard. -They have had
that "day in court" which is the highly prized right of
Americans. .When compelled to there statt their case,"
as a business proposition, it often looks less attractive
to them tha'n it did, while it was cherished as a grievance.
On their side the railroad managers find that in such
contact they also must give reasons for their policy, and
it frequently suffers when a reason must be given.
As far as publicity is concerned, this California method
seems to us to secure the most desirable publicity, far
more beneficial than that which crudely considered
statutes seek. to compel. Upon the.whole there is little
to encourage pessimism in the American railroad situ
ation. The service being the cheapest and the best in
the world by reason of voluntary action of the roads
andnpt. by the compulsion of legislation, there should
l>e reason to hope that other causes of. complaint will
disappear in the amicable friction of reasonable discus
sion. - . * '
lowedthe soil. Let it be known that that is the kind of
women 'we have- in California. With a hoe, or rake, or
rolling-pin, they can knock out and put to flight the
boldest burglar in the business, gun and all.
The record of the last year will show that California
women, of the widow Perkins kind, have captured or
routed more burglars than all the men in the State, in
cluding the police. In our hours of ease, uncertain, coy
and hard to please, these ladies, hbe iff hand, are minis
tering angels of vengeance upon the hard heads of law
less men. Mrs. Perkins deserves some public recogni
tion of her ability to hoe her own row, rgainst all the
porch-climbers in the southern citrus belt.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY^ ijUNE 5, 1904:
THE widow Perkins was hoeing in her garden in the
rich soil of Los Angeles when she heard a burglar
â¢ransacking her house. With her hoe for a weapon
she defied his gun and knocked him down and out, split
ting his scalp and playing a hoe down on his criminal
countenance. .
We offer this woman with the hoe to the poets. -She
is no kin to the ox and no heredity let down her jaw.
She let down the burglar's jaw.and saved hcf hairpins
and purse. When the battle was over she did not scream
nor. faint,' but went back to her garden and her cabbages
with her bloody hoe, and reduced the weeds and mel-

â¢ Fire' gutted the laundry of Sing Lee,
at 306 Jessie street, early last evening.
The Fire Department did remarkable
work in confining the flames to the
building. For a .time the Soto lodg
ing-house, a three-story structure at 32
Fourth street, seemed doomed to de
struction. The total loss caused by
the blaze was over $2000. Nearly half
of this is In clothes destroyed, and, as
the Chinese who conducts the estab

Because the officers of the British 1
bark Auldgirth disobeyed his orders.
Dr. Cumming,-in charge of the federal
quarantine, will probably detain the
vessel under the ban of the yellow flag
for several days. The Auldgirth ar- ;
rived Thursday night, sixty days from â¢
Caleta Buena. Fumigation is consid- :
ered a necessity in the case of vessels
coming from the nitrate ports, and on!
Friday morning. the quarantine author-;
itles started sulphur smudges In, the'
Auldglrth's cabins and ordered that' the '
places being smoked be kept closed un- '
til further orders. When Dr. Cumming
boarded the vessel yesterday. Intending
to release her, he found : that those .
aboard had managed the fumlg'atlpn to ]
suit themselves. They had opened the'
doors and released the germ-destroying
fumes. No official administering fed
eral laws at this port is more cour
teous than JÂ£j< Cumming. but when the
occasion demands he knows how to put
down a number six shoe â¢ so that it
sounds like a plledriver. He ordered
the Auldgirth' Into quarantine, and In-'
stead of the mild, almost formal, fumi
gation at first prescribed the bark will
be given the third degree, with smoke )

AX EXTRA SUPERVISION*
Mrs. Selby secured her divorce on the
ground of neglect, proving to the satis
faction of Judge Hebbard that her hus
band, though a jack of all trades, was
master of none, and was therefore a
poor provider. She showed that she
had to keep a lodging-house in order to
support herself and two children. Her
suit for divorce was brought after Sel
by had sued Donald McRae, the furni
ture man, who owns the lodging-house
kept by Mrs. Selby, for $50,000 damages
for alienating the affections of Mrs.
Selby.
Aunle Steck, who secured a divorce
from Paul Steck in February, 1900, filed
notice to her former husband and his
attorneys yesterday that she demands
that he pay her the alimony awarded In
her decree. She says he owes her $1050,
never having paid anything since the
divorce was granted.
John R". McDonald, an employe of the
United States Government, is the de
fendant in a suit for divorcs brought by
Ella McDonald. She charges neglect.
SUES MeRAE.
Accompanying Selby's notice that he
will" move to set aside the decree of di
vorce is a long statement in his own
handwriting of the facts that led up. to
the difference between himself and his
wife. It contains many reflections on
American courts and laws, and* sets
fcrtn that the petitioner does not think
it a crime to be poor. He says Robert
Louis Stevenson was once poverty
stricken, and that therefore it could
not be considered that he (Selby) dis
graced himself when he became poor.
He claims also that his wife should not
be allowed to plead his poverty as a
ground for divorce, and says that, in
his opinion, when poverty, overtakes a
husband it is the wife's duty to help
him until such time as he again be
comes self-supporting.. r ;f
Isaac Selby, the Australian minister,
lecturer, debater, author, solicitor,
teacher and insurance agent, from
whom Theresa Beatrice Selby obtained
a decree of divorce in Judge Hebbard's
court last January, is dissatisfied with
the judgment of the court He filed a
notice yesterday that he would on Fri
day next appear before Judge Hebbard
and ask that the decree be declared
null and void on the ground that it was
obtainÂ£d because he, as his own attor
ney, did' not have sufficient knowledge
of the law to present his case or to pro
duce evidence in refutation of that of
his wife. ;
These twelve men will sit in judg
ment upon Jacob Eppinger, the erst
while grain king, who is charged by
the International Banking Company
with obtaining money under false pre
tenses. The trial on a criminal charge
is the outgrowth of the failure of the
firm of Eppinger & Co. about one year
ago. The failure "looked bad" to the
men on the street and an investigation
and the indictment of Jacob Eppinger
followed. Â« I'
The work of selecting the jury has
proceeded very slowly, occupying the
court for three days. Attorneys Ach,
Shortridge and Dunne for the defense
fought hard to have the entire panel
dismissed on technical grounds, but
the court overruled their objections
and the work of selecting talesmen
was begun. Each prospective juror
was put through a most rigid exami
nation by the defense, while the prose
cution passed the majority with but
few interrogations.
The defense was particularly care
ful to keep men out of the jury box
who were connected in any manner
with the banking Institutions of the
city and might thus be prejudiced
against the defendant. The question
was repeatedly asked: "If you knew
the banks of this city had combined
to prosecute this defendant, would it
influence you In any manner?" Aside
from the reference to a combination
of bankers no intimation has as yet
been given as to what lines the defense
will follow. Â¦
The taking of testimony will begin
at 10 o'clock to-morrow rooming.

MOWS THE TIME TO
We're Getting Ready for Summer, Everything in the Way of
j # Used and Slightly Shopworn Pianos to Be Closed Out.
It is indeed surprising how many used Pianos of other makes come to ua al-
Â¦ most daily in part payment for our fine new Hazelton, and Decker, and Lester,
' and Kimball Upright and Grand Pianos.
Most of them are really excellent instruments, though possibly a trifle out of
j date when compared â¢with modern catalogue styles.
Times are very prosperous! New homes are building everywhere, and when
i they are occupied a fine new Piano is esaential in the new environments. The old
piano is discarded.
That is how most of the instruments enumerated in the list came to the
Pommer-Eilers establishment.
Then there are also a number of very fine, new Pianos that may have been
consigned or placed on sale with country dealers, who could not find ready sale
for such expensive instruments, and returned them at a discount, v
i Again, there are also some really new instruments which have suffered slight
! mars or bruises in an overcrowded warehouse. These have also been thrown into
' this sale to make it one of general and extensive interest.
j The prices named are on a strictly cash basis. Any instrument in the sale
I may.be obtained on time payments, however, by paying simple interest on <5e-
! ferred payments at eight per cent per annum.
I Payments as low as $5 a month, or at other stated periods agreeable to the
purchaser, may be arranged for.
Instruments ordered by telegram will be reserved only until letter can arrive,
and will be shipped anywhere subject to examination and trial.
Every instrument has been placed in the best possible condition, and we
guarantee each one to represent a positive saving of nearly one-third to the re-
i tall buyer. Remember our agreement. "Money back if not satisfactory," goes
with every instrument in this sale. . :

Â¦ In assigning the different chances to
the States it was . understood that no
other locality would make a bid for the
convention. It is expected that such an
agreement will result in, great good to
the entire Pacific; Coast. Each State
will name the place to which the con
vention is. to go in- the event of the or
ganization accepting, the invitation.
This _ will be- the. first time that such
concerted action- 'has been attempted,
andaccording to the men that have the
matter In hand will greatly simplify the
matter of selecting convention cities.

a collection 'of Jewish religious relics

"There is nothing in the collection

at once the difference between a: rare

Job picking fruit."
The stranger was incredulous for a
time, but was convinced when told that
many seasons fruit actually rotted be
cause of lack of labor to gather it. .
The Easterners form some misconcep
tions, like those that grew when Cali
fornia was only a golden El Dx>rado
and it was thought one could take a
buckskin bag and gather enough nug
gets anywhere before breakfast to ob
viate the necessity of working for a
year. Now an impression is gaining
ground that city life in California is
rendered uncomfortable in^ winter be
cause the December rains knock the
ripening fruit from the apricot and
peach trees that line the streets, caus
ing the chokins of surface drains and
an overflow of the thoroughfares.
California canned fruit has one ele
ment of unpopularity, in that the can
nera are unable to put enough in one
can. When a two-pound can of Cali
fornia 'peaches is opened and only
three peaches are found in it the East
erner is prone to think he has gone
against a confidence game, though he
has to acknowledge that the scales
show proper weight.

Purchase Exposition will contain.* The
wonderful Benquist . collection \ is t^ be

relics, valued at $1,000,000, that now. re
poses in the Benqulst home, at 920 Ful

expert collection by Hadji Ephraim
Benquist, who moved to San Francisco
in 1894 from Boston, where '. ; he was
known as the "beggar for museums.'.'
and Vitall Benquist, his brother, who Is
a connossieur will known .throughout
Europe. â¢ Mordecal . Benquist, son of
Hadji, is here to attend the details. '.
A man of moderate means who said
he wanted to buy a small fruit orchard

Weilbye.
"Is there anything there- the children

final query.
The way they take to it, however, fore
tells the eclipse of the gr6en article in
time. Commissioner Merritt of Santa
Barbara has' been distributing' ripe
olives to visitors, and nearly every
Easterner who samples them says he
had never tasted any before and is sur
prised that he has remained in ignor
ance of their excellence so long. Many
have taken the addresses of firms from

shown in other products. Including

ST. LOUIS, June 4.â They're all going
to California. ' That's what the county
commissioners think from the ques
tions asked them and the intense con
cern shown by visitors in the exhibit of]
the Golden State. Never has the land j
of fruits . made such a. fetching show. I
The pretty booths and pavilions on the
aisles within the green .facade, with
their varied adornments, have become j
famous on the fair grounds. At other
expositions visitors have taken great
delight in California's display, but
never before : have so many earnest
questions been asked nor have so many
people declared their Intention of Jour
neying to the State, either on a visit or
to settle- there. The only thing that
puzzles them is What part of California
to visit, every section shewing such
wonders in the way of products. *
"There it is!" Is a common expression
coming from some member of a sight

They are all looking for itâ this splen
did display of the counties. Many
view it and then personally lead up all
their friends for a look. The county
commissioners are kept busy even now,
when the crowds are slim as World's j
Fair crowds go, and are wondering ,
whether they will have to employ phon- j
ographs when the throngs come in all
their immensity. Every one must be
courteously answered, and the nian. be

a bunch of grapes is spliced, and must |

grown there are that size. Tact and

the details of the explosion, including
also a hazard as to its cause. 'He > at
tributes' it to the probability * that in
lowering the mixer " paddles into the
mixer the workmen allowed it to drop
upon the rubber buffers too violently
and the elasticity of the rubber allowed
the mixer to strike the' bottom with
such force as to ignite the- explosive.
McCullough. together with Veale,; was
engaged in preparing; a hoist for the
mixer, which had been sent" to the ma
chine shop only yesterday. J Â¦ Veale -'told

STOCKTON, June 4.â The warehouse
men and mtllmen have demanded that
the Mayor furnish protection for the
non-union men who have replaced the
striking and locked-out longshoremen.
The police have thus far confined their
efforts merely to preventing so far as
possible, any overt act. Crowds of strik
ers and' their sympathizers have been
permitted to gather and annoy the
workmen as they have gone to and
from work. This keeps the neighbor
hood in an unsettled condition and 13
causing the police to work overtime.
Mayor Williams to-day told the un
ion leaders that if they would keep
their rr.PTt. away from the front he
would try and bring about a settlement.
For this reason the disturbed section
was more quiet this evening. It is un
derstood that, regardless of the result
of tha conferences, the crowds will not
be allowed to again congregate to an
noy the non-unionists.
The "warehousemen and millmen as
sert that they have plenty of men and
that business is moving with usual dis
patch, and that the only trouble expe
rienced Is In the annoyance to their
employes.

Mrs. Hansen, the bride of three days,
had nothing to, add to the story that
appeared in The Call of yesterday
morning. The bride, who was Lena
Peterson,, married Hansen In her
parents' house in Petaluma three days
before the tragedy and the wuple
came to this city to prepare for their
trip to Seattle and the Northwest.
When they retired on Friday night
to their apartments in the Grand Ho
tel Hansen was In cheerful spirits. At
about -half- past 2 o'clock in the morn
ing he arose and went into an adjoin
ing apartment. In response to his wife's
question he said that he would return
shortly. A minute later she was hor
rified to hear the report of a pistol pro-'
ceeding from the room her husband
had* entered, and she ran in scream
ing. She saw his dead body seated in
a chair, his head resting on' a t table
and covered with Â¦ blood. Then she
shrieked In agony and fell unconscious
beside Ills body. â¢ :
Hansen was a bricklayer and worked
about the city for* some yeafs' past.
He . is said to have Inherited some
money, from his father's estate in Ger
many, also the share of a brother who
died In the Philippines, j Mrs. Hansen's
father came to this city early yester
day morning after learning of the
tragedy and took his daughter back to
his^ home In Petaluma.
Mystery envelops the cause of the
suicide of Peter Hansen at the Grand
Hotel. early yesterday morning,, and the
authorities are at a loss to account for
his act. "
Further., inquiry last evening \ at. 817

street, however, said that Christian
science had nothing to do with the
trouble, but .was . simply mentioned to
Mrs. Wilson a day , or: so^ago as a rem-i

yesterday in ,a restaurant at 219 Ellis
street. She 'was accompanied' by" her
nurse, a Mrs. Dennett,, who had been
directed by Dr. Wilton Prest,on to bring
her charge to him this morning for
treatment. On. reaching the restaurant
Mrs. Wilson became unmanageable and
persisted in entering the place, where
she created such a scene that. the pro

Emergency Hospital. There Urs. Wil

was afterward released In charge of
her nurse and C.- Shepherd, her broth

the hospital staff. She was taken to
her rooms at 817 Post street. It 'was*
reported from several sources that Mrs.
Wilson is the wife 'cf an Englishman,

Miss Harry was an orphan
possessed of $400,000. Gopcevic was
a gripman; with a narrative that he
was a descendant of the royal family
of Servia. The gripman would raise
his cap to the heiress, when she got
on his car arid the heiress would smile
at the gripman. The outcome of this
interchange of courtesies was a mar
riage . which startled the various
grades of -society.
A few, months later the bride sud
denly died. In her will she devised'
one-half of. her estate to her husband
and the other half to *ny child. that
might' be .born' to them. \ As she died
childless,' the entire estate, under, the
law .belongs ;ito Gopcevic.
The young woman's mother had given
the. estate . to " the daugnter with the
proviso that the property should re
vert to Mary Floyd McAdoo, Rosalie

The court issued a temporary re
straining order yesterday, 'returnable
July 5, and directed that Judge Sayre
be present at that time to show why
the prohibition should j not be made
permanent. Â¦
He induced Superior Judge M. S.
Sayre of Lake County to issue an or
der declaring that the estate would be
distributed to Gopcevic next Mon
day. The other heirs attempted to per
suade the Judge to postpone action for
awhile, but he refused. The question
was presented to the Supreme Court
with the request that Judge Sayre be
restrained from distributing the es
tate.
Mllos Mlltrov Gopcevic, the Sacra
mento street car gripman, who came
into public notic^- by marrying Harry
Augustus Floyd, suffered a reverse in
his attempt to secure possession of. his
wife's estate at the hands of the Su

of the property and the ,ex-gripman

der before a jury In â Judge Murphy's
court and was acquitted on March
1898. Seven charges of felony â¢embez
zlement and ..two charges of. forgery
against him were dismissed on Decem
ber 3, 1898, on motion of, the . District
Attorney.
It is also alleged by Miles that Figel
had passed several fictitious checks on
the Bank of California and other banks,
but he supposes that they had been
made good by Figel's father, who has
a tailor shop in the Flood building, ' as
no action has been taken against him.
Miles further says that his bank will
not compromise the matter, but will
push it to a finish.
Figel acquired considerable notoriety
through his arrest on June 30, 1897, for
the mujder of hls*employer, Isaac Hoff
man of Hoffman, Rothchild & Co.,
wholesale merchants, Battery and.Mar
ket streets, on June 1. Figel was.em
ployed as cashier for the firm, and on
the evening of June 1 Hoffman's body
was discovered in the office. There was
every Indication of a desperate strug
gle. Figel claimed that he left Hoff
man in the office just in time to catch
the Tiburon boat. rJX :' -
Miles says that Flgel called at the
bank last Saturday and said he want
ed to open an account in the name of
Sam Klein, one of his friends. He de
posited a* check in favor of Klein on
the New Western Bank, and on the
strength of that deposit the check for
$9G5 90 presented by Figel on Tuesday
morning was cashed. It was' later found
that the check on the New Western
Bank was worthless." â¢ â¢ ' '
A warrant was issuedby.Police Judge
Fritz yesterday for the arrest of Theo
dore A. Figel on a felony charge - of ut
tering and passing a fictitious' check for
$963 90 on May 31 on the Wells-Fargo
Bank. The complaining witness is John
E. Miles, assistant cashier of the bank.
The check was drawn in favor of Fred
Bacon and purported to be signed by
Sam Klein. It is alleged that both these
persons are figments of Figel's imag
ination.

The fact of the union making a de
mand upon the company is strictly
In keeping with the rules of the union.
After the union decided to go out on
strike the individuals hid nothing fur
ther to say.
The question of an advance of wages
was presented to the company one
month ago and the union set the date
for the reply last night. As no reply
was forthcoming the union took the
silence as a sign of refusal and went
into counsel.
What the results will be it is for the
future to determine. The company is
firm and so are the men. Both sides
are after results and they both say
they will jret them. The union de
clares it has the* right of wage3 and
the company : .says It has the right to
say what ft will pay. ~
When the men quit last night their
work was practically done and no
trains were' delayed by the action of
the, union. Whether there will be
any further trouble is a matter which
is up'to the company and the union.
Southern Pacific freight handlers at
station "B" of Third and Townsend
streets went out on strike at 11 o'clock
last night. They want 23 cents per
hour and Insist upon their demands.
In order to determine what steps
should be taken a meeting of the union
was held after the ultimate hour had
expired last night and the vote of the
union was to strike. Being Saturday
night, there was little work for the
freight handlers to da. and as a conse
quence the railroad company was not
placed in an embarrassing position, nor
was the union taking undue advantage
of conditions.

r The body of a Chinese; thought to be
that of Ah Hung, was found some dis
tance from the .scene of ; the . ruin.
the youth, but he escaped altogether
to destruction a little ' while before
there remained hardly enough of their
> fleeh for identification. The skulls, or
pieces of the skulls, of McCullough and
Eraith were found but mat was all.
There wai nothing to help reveal the
identity of two of the Chinese.
"One person only escaped out of the
six who were regularly employed in
the gelatine house. He is Howard
Veale, 18 years old, son of Sheriff Veale
of Contra Costa County. Veale'6 es
cape was nothing short or miraculous
snd he owes his life to a premonition
that there would be an accident to
day. Just before the explosion Veale
was suddenly seized with the convic
tion that the plant would be blown up^
Then he Eiiitl to McCullough, who was
foreman of the plant:
"It don't look good to me. She's go-
Ins; to blow ujj/V i '.
With these '.vords Veale left the place
snd 'ran behind "the bulkheads fifty
feet away. He had not any more than
got behind them and thrown hhnself
?n the ground when the explosion
came. Timbers landed on'all sides of
BERKELEY, June 4.â Three hundred
pounds of nitro-glycerine exploded at
the California Powder Works this
morning at Pinole and crushed out the
lives of five men. two of them white
end three Chinese. In an endeavor to
save the entire plant from destruction
by the fire that followed the explosion
two other white men were injured, one
of them so seriously that he may die.
The dead are:
ALEXANDER McCULLOUGH, 30
years old. married. y
JOHN EVANS SMITH, 30 years old,
tingle.
AH HUNG.
HONG SOY.
LOE BOW.
The wounded are:
S. S. McKinley, skull probably frac
tured.
George C. Cooper, foot injured.
Besides the loss of life there was
a great destruction of property. The
powder company estimates its loss at
$30,000. This was due to "the complete
viping out of the gelatine mixing
plant, the giant mixing plant and the
ice works. â¢ All around the inclosure at
the works are evidences of the great
force of the concussion. Of the two
mixing plants there is nothing standing
above the ground but a few broken
timbers. Only the gelatine plant suf
fered from the explosion, the other two
buildings having burned to the ground
after being- set afire by the flying de
bris. -
FIRE FOLLOWS EXPLOSION.
The explosion must have occurred at
fc*:40 o'clock, for all the clocks in Pinole
vere stopped at that hour. There was
a sudden detonation, that Jarred upon
the ears of all within a mile of the
plant. > Every man about the works,
knew at once what had happened at
the gelatine works. There was no time
to co there to investigate, for fire had
broken out immediately in a dozen
places. Burning timbers landed upon
the roofs of buildings full of explo
cives, and the dry grass was being de
voured by the flames in a dozen direc
tions.
In defiance of all rules of safety and
eelf-preservation, the employes of the
plant at once hurried out to do what
they could to blot out the flames. The
fire department called every man td
his station, and for an hour they all
vorked with desi>eration. It took all
that time to master the flames, so that
eome idea of the danger involved In
this undertaking may be had. The lighf
cost S. 6. McKinley, shipping clerk at
the plant, a broken head, and George
C. Cooper, a carrwnter, a badly lac
erated foot. These men were caught by
tailing timbers while fighting at the
? Â«'-e plant and buried beneath them.
The bravery of these workmen turned
firemen saved an Immense amount, of
property and probably many lives.
Tons and tons of high explosives were
time and again In danger of being
fired by the falling embers. It was
mainly a fight to keep the flames away
from the big storage houses, and out
cf the struggle came victory.
After the plant had been saved from
destruction there was time to investi
gate the ruins of the gelatine plant,
â¢where it was certain there was nothing
left cf the five human beings to tell
the tale. Where formerly there stood a
etout building for the manufacture of
gelatine there only remained then a
few blackened ruins. Even the great
bulkheads surrounding the works to
modify the effects of Just such an ac
cident as occurred to-day were toppled
over on tttelr sides.

ST. LOUIS, June j. â The junior and
senior Amateur Athletic Union cham
pionship games were held at the
World's Fair Stadium to-day under
the most adverse circumstances. A
heavy downpour of rain left deep pools
of water on the field and track and
kept all spectators away . from the
junior i events, which, were held first.
Fires were built on the' field to dry
places for the discus, shotput and
hammer-throwing contests, while * a
brigade of men with sponges and
buckets sopped the pools from the
tracks. Despite these drawbacks some
good records were made, many of the
previous junior Amateur Athletic
Union, records being broken. The sun
came out hot for the senior events and
several hundred spectators braved the
mud and secured seats in advantage
ous positions to get a view of Miss
Alice Roosevelt, who occupied the
President's box, and presented the
medals to the winners at the end of
the games.
The meet was won by the New York
Irish Athletic Association of New
York, the representatives of which"
scored 61 points. The New York Ath
letic Club came next, with 45 points;

CHICAGO, June 4.â Harlem Park
accommodations were , taxed to their
utmost to-day at the opening of the
spring -meeting, of which the Harlem
National handicap was the attraction.
By* the time the field was called to the
post in the first race it was estimated
15,000 spectators were Jammed int/> the
grand stand, betting ring,- paddock and
on. the lawns. Forty books cut In In
the big' ring, the largest number ever
known at any track of late years, ex
cept at "Washington Park. A light
rain began to fall before the first race
was run, which continued during - the
greater part of the afternoon. Owing
to the slow condition of the track there
were many scratches In all t the events,
seven being withdrawn from the fea
ture event.
James Arthur's Bondage, at 5 to 1,
ridden by J. Mclntyre, won the rich
Harlem National handicap, with Fon
pcluca second and Gregor K third.
The race waa won easily, with the sec
ond driving:. Bondage, always well up,
ran over his field when called upon,
and came home In a canter. Fonsoluca
had to go the limit at the end, com
ing with a rush and barely getting up
in time to beat out Gresror K. which
set most of the pace. Horatlus was
just outside the money, closing a big
gap in the stretch run. Felipe Lugo
was fast for a mile, while Bragg show
ed a flash of speed. '
One favorite and two second choices
won, the other races going to outsiders.

Rope for Belting.
Manila rope is steadily superseding
leather belting for the transmission of
power in our mills and factories. _It
is almost universally used .for that
purpose in English factories, and has
been for a long time. The change has
been stimulated here, no doubt, by the
acquisition of the Philippines, where
the Manila hemp flourishes. The fiber
of this hemp varies in length. from six
to twelve feet and occasionally reaches
a length of eighteen feet. It Is said
that It has a tensile strength of 50,000
pounds per square inch, greater than
that of any known fiber. Transmission
ropes have the advantage of noiseless
ness, owing to their flexibility and to
an air passage in the groo\'es between
the rope and the sheave.â-Philadel

HARBIN SPRINGS, June 4.â It Is a
well-known fact Champion Jim
Jeffries cares no more for a hundred
dollars than Hetty Green or Russell
Sage do for a postage stamp. Not that
he tries to corner the wine market or
shoot up the establishments where
liquid goods are dispensed, but he sim
ply does not give the collection of
money a thought. Jeff. is a long, long
way from being broke at that, and had
he been constituted of a more grasping
nature could almost have been a mil
lionaire at the present time with the
opportunities he has had.
His brother Jack tells a good story
illustrating the carelessness of Jeff
where financial questions are Involved.
Jack is a young man of irreproachable
reputation, wears medals earned for
truthfulness and veracity, does not be
long to the Social Setters Up, an or
ganization here at the springs for the
propounding of "dopey" Ideas and ad
vancement ' of ethereal thoughts, and
no salt, lime juice or tabasco sauce is
required .to make It digestible. Just
after he had' beaten Fitzsimmohs the
big fellow was rummaging through his
trunk when he stumbled across a bank
book on an Oakland savings institu
tion. On the first page was written
512,000 to the credit of James J. Jeffries.
There was no question about the name
being all right, so\Jeff hunted up his
old friend, John Marcovlch, tha Oak
land restaurant man* and together the
pair paid, a visit to the bank. .Without
hesitation the cashier said there was
$12,000, on deposit^ to the credit of Mr.
Jeffries. The boilermaker had forgotten
all about this little plant.
A terrific nor'wester, the strongest
in years, traveled through here to-day,
and to-night is still holding Its own,
scattering leaves and boughs In regular
showers.
Manager Billy Delaney was due this
afternoon, and soon after breakfast
Jen! was stripped and hard at work In
the gymnasium. For almost two solid
hours he labored industriously, at the
conclusion of which he remarked, while
seated on the rowing machine for a
breathing spell, "I'll be stronger for
this fight, than when I tnet-'Corbett."
This should be cheerful news for Mun
roe, but then, perhaps, under the hyp
notizing treatments of Tim McGrath
the miner will be abfe to stand a longer
shlft.'too. â¢ â¢ â¢' ' Â¦;
Jen* began with the pulley weights
for a warming-up exercise. Then for
twenty solid minutes he hammered the
bag viciously until the perspiration
actually oozed from his great frame.
With only a short breathing spell, he
skipped the rope 800 times. Next the
big fellow shoved and tugged with the
Immense swinging sandbag, work about
ad light and easy as the ordinary man
would find it pushing a bank 'safe up
Telegraph Hill: Shadow boxing with
the light bells followed. Jeff Intended
to hustle his sparring partners around
in the afternoon, but changed his mind
and went for a run on the road instead.
After dinner he participated in a game
of ball, occupying the pitcher's box.
His drop ball, combined with the errors
of Captain Kennedy, proved too much
for the opposing team.
The champion is apparently fit and
ready for a short fight, and when the
night of the big contest arrives will be
on edge to go any route.
Billy Delaney states that all the
minor details of the big match were ar
ranged with Manager Coffroth, and
dnly an accident wilf prevent the two
big ' fellows from putting up their
hands. F. E. MULHOLLAND.
Qunint Combinations.
In the Western Union code book you
will find many queer, .quaint combina
tions cooked up to form addresses. For
instance â "Lawful," "Rainbow,"
"Seedcod," "Poor," "Clderhouse,"
"Dogpalace," "Mague," "Waterpaint,"
"Pighair." "Prettlmaid," "Goldenrule."
"Geodefbart," "Ithagunco," "Acaudas
sur," "Alewotpol," "Takenfurn," "Lyx
glavio," "Gopraytutl." Some people of
a superstitious turn of mind are in
clined to be cranky about their cable
addresses. They insist on having
words of their own selection registered,
to the great distress of the clerk, who is
obliged to refuse . them.â Washington

GRAVEsfeND, June 4.â Without
doubt the most Interesting race of the
afternoon was the Broadway stakes,
for three-year-oldsT In which "Highball,"
admitted to be last year's best two
year-old, was for the first time this
season required to meet only colts of his
own age, instead of being pitted against
the best horses in training.
' At the start there was a cry of dis
may when Highball was apparently
not ready, yet he could not have lost
much ground, for Hildebrand at once
drove him up to the others, and with
Montresson setting the pace and Bryn
Mavrr third, a pretty contest was going
on. Dolly Spanker was being ridden a
waiting race. The pace was apparently
good, though not fast, yet at all times
Bryn Mawr was cloEe enough up to
win. He generally drops far behind. On
this occasion he was. slightly pocketed,
and on the far turn both Highball and
Montresson outran him. As they turned
Into the -stretch Highball j cut across
behind Montresson and took the rail,
v.-hile Bryn Mawr came up in the cen
ter of the track. Apparently he was
winning easily, but Hildebrand, began
to ride Highball hard and Inch by Inch
he closed. It was not until fifty yards
from the finish' that Lyne on Bryn
Mawr realized that he was in danger
of defeat. Then he worked hard for a
few strides, and with Highball closing
rapidly the two pasesd the Judges a
short head apart, Bryn Mawr in front.

WORKS WITH A WILL
- Six new intercollegiate conference
records were made and two of the old
marks were equaled. In the weight
events "Giant" Rose, the Californlan,
now of Michigan, broke the conference
record in the 'shot put, establishing a
new mark at 47 feet % inch, and beat-
Ing the old figure, held by Klrby of No
tre Dame, by nearly six feet. In the
discus throw also Rose set a new mark,
hurling the weight a distance of 125
feet Z\L inches, which is almost seven
feet better than the record made by
Swift of Iowa. One of the surprises of
the meet came with the announcement
that Thomas of Purdue had outdone
Rose in the hammer throw and Inci
dentally had created a new record.
Twenty feet was added to the former
record held by Pell of Drake College,
the new mark being 1B7 feet 1 Inch.
| The Leland Stanford Jr. University
team, which came from the Pacific
Coast to enter the contest, failed to
show up as well as expected, landing
only one first. Dole of that institution
carrying away the honors in the pole
vault. He crossed the bar at 11 feet 6%
inches. Although credited with a prac
tice record of more than 12 feet. Dole
was unable to-day to beat the inter
collegiate record of 11 feet 9 Inches,
held by Dvorak of Michigan. The
principal scores follow: Michigan 32,
Chicago 29. Wisconsin 25, Purdue 13,
Stanford 9, Illinois 6. Summary:

of Michigan wyn the Intercollegiate
Conference Athletic Association meet,
held on Marshall Field to-day, securing
32 points. Chicago waa second with 29
points and Wisconsin third with a total
of 25. . .
The grandstand at Ingleside race
: course never held aofalr a gathering
of spectators as looked out with eager
eyes on the picturesque track yester
day, at the inaugural field day^ of the
Public School Athletic League.
Such a riot- of color, stfch a wealth of
beauty could be seen omy at Just such
a gathering of the boys and the girls of
California. Their love of the out-of
door life is seen in the sparkling eyes
and the delicately tinted cneeks which
indicate health and all the Joys which
follow in ts train.
The scene was an animated one
throughout the afternoon, the boy
athletes being spurred on to mighty
deeds on the path by the wild outbursts
of applause of their scnooimates. As
an additional incentive the thirteen
athletes who won the fifteen events on
the'eard will tÂ« sent to the St. Louis
exposition by W. R. Hearst to com
pete* against boys of their own age
from all parts of America.
William Greer Harrison was referee
and Phil Wand starter. Among the
other well known sportsmen who acted
as officials were W. B. Hinchman.
George James. F. W. Koch, Frank
Thompson, John A. Hammersmith,
Max Rosenfeld, Kenneth Melrose and
H. V. Ramsdell. The programme was
disposed of with facility a* once re
markable and commendable. The con
testants came out promptly and there
were no delays. Some years hence,
when these boys are ths star athletes
of the colleges, they will have acquired
other ideas as to their Importance and
will move with greater deliberation
when energetic officials try to get them
on the track.
Toni, of Lincoln School, won the 100
yard dash for grammar school boys
and a.lso the broad Jump. Bonner, of

cap run here at Delmar track- to-day
resulted In a blanket finish, with Jor
dan winning. Jack Young, after being
left at the post, was messed about all
over the track or he would eurely have
finished first Dan McKenna and Fore
hand could not get up. Platoon, at 1
to 2. was beaten by Franco in the open
ing event of the card. Franco was
heavily played. A big crowd saw the
races run and the books got most of
the money. Judge Murphy leaves to
r.ight to preside at Kenilworth. Ed
v ard ilaginn will probably succeed
him. Summary:

Tacoma Coes to Pieces and Nineteen
Huns Are Piled Up.
SEATTLE HAS ITS REVENGE.
Buck Francks' single through Beck,
which let Byrnes and Buchanan in,
won the battle right there. It might
hare been more, but Bobby Ganley be
came a dead one on trying to make
third on the hit. He kicked good and
strong at the ruling, but it went all the
same.
Francks made two plays in the sixth
that were splendid. Drennan listed a
high one to short center, and it looked
safer than money in the Mint, but
Francks stuck out one mitt and grabbed
it with his back turned. The applause
had hardly died away ere Nadeau lined
a screecher over second. Buck was
there once more with one hand and
threw the runner out at first by many
feet.
After the third inning Portland got
but one man to first base. Buchanan
had everything on the list, Including
curves, speed, slow balls and a change
of pace that was bewildering. The
score:
Oakland â - 1 Portland â

Shea bit off a saucy single) to right,
and Butler was there with the bunt
that advanced him. McCreedie toraj a
torrid one through second, and Shea
meandered toward third. Kruger
grabbed the ball and lined it to Deve
reaux. The old red boy could not
squeeze it, and on the error Shea came
in with Portland's solitary run.
Oakland started without losing any
time. Jimmy Byrnes unloaded one on
Francis that started foul and then
rolled fair. Buchanan laid down a
bunt and Beck fumbled it. Bobby Gan
ley did likewise, and Butler posed for a
minute while thinking where to throw
the ball and, of course, Ganley beat it
to first.
The best Portland could do with the
twisters of Buchanan was three hits.
He pitched shutout ball, and would
a no-run victory to his credit had
j Mr. Devereaux tightened his flippers
I on the ball when Kruger lined it in to
I him from deep center field In the third
round.
Portland got a run over the pan at
Recreation Park in the third round yes
terday; Oakland grot two over during
the first half of the mixup. After that
it was peace and quietness for the re
mainder of the game. Perhaps the Com
muters could have piled up a few more,
but what was the use of overexertlon
on a hot day when one run 1? enough
with which to win a ball game?
Real gingery stuff it was in every
round. The entire game was reeled off
in an hour and twenty minutesâ the
fastest time made on the diamond this
season. Into this short space of time
was crowded some grand pitching and
fielding of the brightest kind.

Sailing vessels, under all circum
stances, have the light of way over
vessels propelled by steam power, and
although, under the conditions of wind
and weather prevailing at the time of
the collision, the Spokane was prob
ably more under control than the Bear,
the responsibility for the accident will
rest upon the cutter ar.d many yards
of t5T>ewritten explanations will soon
be heading for Washington.
The revenue cutter's port watch was
below when the err.ash came and nar
rowly escaped death. The forecastle
doors. Jammed by the twisting of the-
Bear's hull, had to be burst open to
release the sailors. Boatswain Thur
ber, who had his ankle sprained, was*
the only man Injured.
The Bear was headed back_for the
Golden Gate and arrived yesterday af
ternoon, poing directly to her anchor
age off Sausallto. where she will re
main until the contract for repairing
her has been let. Her northern cruise
has been indefinitely postponed.
The Spokane Is owned by Pope &
Talbot of this city. She Is a four
masted schooner of 570 tons register.
That she did not cut completely'
through the Bear is a rare tribute to
the revenue cutter'B strength of tim
ber.
Th* Unttcd States revenue cutter
Bear. Captain Myrlclc, ana the schoon
er Epckare. Captain Jamison, were In
coUlaloa at 1:SS a. m.. June 4. about
thirty miles west-northwest of Point
Hexes. The Government vessel was
tflitin acted and otherwise seriously
damaged, while the men on the port
"watch narrowly escaped being crushed
to death In their bunks. The schooner
had bowsprit, Jibboom, stem and cat
head carried away and fore rigging
damaged. Both vessels came Into port
yesterday.
The Bear left here June 2 for Seattle,
from which port she was to have
started on her regular cruise to Alaska.
Northerly winds made her progress
â¢low, but she was getting along falTly
well when the Spokane appeared on the
scene. TVhlle the Bear was struggling
against head winds and a high sea, the
Epokane, six days out from Port,
Gamble and heavily laden with lum
ber, was booming along with a whole
some northwester roaring behind her.
Third Lieutenant Harwood was on
the Bear's bridge when the collision
occurred. ThÂ« night was dark and
.hazy, he says, and the first Intimation
he had of trouble was when the Spo
kane suddenly burst through the cur
tain of mist.
The schooner struck the Bear on the
aide, at the foremast, carrying
Â«way that spar, with rigging, yards
and all the other attachments; ripping
out thirty feet of bulwarks, smashing
rails and stanchions and cutting the
Government beat to the water's edge.
The rail of the Bear's upper deck and
the ms.ln topmast were also carried
away.

g Give me a man broken down from excesses, dissipation, boyish folly, hard work or worry, from any
g cause which has sapped his vitality. Let him follow my advice for three months, and I will make him as
H vigorous in every respect as any man of his age.
B I will not promise to make a Hercules of a man who was never intended by nature to T>e strong

S 'his strength I can make as cood as he ever was.
21 I can give back to any man what he has lost by abuse of the laws of nature, I can stop all drains

Â¦ A man who is nervous, whose brain and body are weak, who sleeps badly, awakes more tired than
H when he went to bed, who is easily discouraged, inclined to brood over imaginary troubles, who has lost

E The whole force of vitality in your body is dependent upon your animal electricity. When you lose
g that by draining the system in any manner my Belt will replace it and cure you.

Maine Association's Picnic
The twenty-sixth anniversary of the
State of Maine Association of Califor
nia was celebrated by & plcnlo at Shell
Mound Park yesterday. A largÂ« throng
of -merry-makers assembled at the
grounds and the day was spent in
exercises," games, races and dancinÂ»;_J
A dinner, consisting of baked bean^l
brown bread and coffee, was served
by the sons and daughters of the Pine
Tree State. The literary exercises be
gan at 1:30 p.m. An hour later games
and races were in order and the draw
ins 'or fifty-six handsome prizes was
held at 4:30.
William B. Kennedy, alias Richard
Jackson, alias "Yellow," expected to re
gain his liberty at 4 o'clock yesterday
afternoon, but at that hour, when he
was released from the County Jail. De
tectives Taylor and Coleman stepped
up to him and placed him under arrest
on a warrant sworn to by Taylor before
Police Judge Fritz yesterday. Thi3
charged him with the murder of Police
man Eugene C. Robinson at Sixteenth
and Valencia streets on the morning of
January 21, 1902. He was taken to the
City Prison and booked on the charge.
Kennedy had been previously con
victed on the same charge, but the Su
preme Court granted him a new trial
on the ground that he could not be con
victed on the uncorroborated testimony
of an accomplice. He was discharged
by Judge Cook, and since then he has.
been arrested on different charges and
released on writs of habeas corpus. On
Thursday afternoon Judge Cook re
manded him into the custody of the
Sheriff for forty-eight hours. If at the
end of that time the Sheriff of San
United States Local Inspectors Bolles
and Bulger handed down the following
decision yesterday in tne matter of the
steamer Santa Cruz, which struck the
reef near Point San Luis, California,
in a thick fog on May 3:
From testimony taken in our investi
gation of this case, we find that the
Santa Cruz, C. Alberts, master, was on
her voyage from San Pedro, Cal., to
San Francisco, Cal., via Port Harford.
Point Arguello was passed about 1%
miles distant by four point bearings.
At about 11 p. m.. May 7, it shut In
thick fog, with light northwest wind,
and small to moderate swell and con
tinued so until the vessel struck. The
whistle on Point San Luis was heard
at 1:55 a. m., May 8, bearing about 2V_
to 3 points off the port bow. The Bteam
er was running at full speed and no
soundings were taken. Captain Al
berts heard the surf and Immediately
ordered the engines backed full speed,
but before the headway of the vessel
was stopped she struck the reef. She
then backed clear and proceeded to the
dock at Port Harford, where tempor
ary repairs were made by a diver and
the steamer continued on her voyage
to San Francisco.
After a careful consideration of the
evidence in this case we find that Cap
tain C. Alberts was unskilled in run
ning the Santa Crua at full speed in
a thick fog, especially when so near
the land; and that he was also negli
gent in not taking soundings on May
8, 1904. For rÂ«a_scn of such negligence
and unsklllfulness, we "nave this day
suspended his license as master and
pilot for sixty'days. Damage to steam
er about $1000.

day he would have so informed Judge

It was for rearrestinjf Kennedy on
Thursday that Detectives Dinan and

Cook and fined $1 each. Attorney New

The Supervisors were also asked to
amend ordinance 2944 so that one. per
mit shall be required for each place
of general sale or storage of milk. Such
permits shall not be granted for more
than three months and may be renewed
upon proper application to the Health
Department, provided, however, that
no such permit shall be renewed if
there have been violations of any of
the rules relating to dairies.
The Civil Service Commission was
asked for an experienced clerk for the

W. H. Chickering, the attorney, who,
in a suit to quiet title filed against him
by Cecile Dolon, a masseuse at the Lur
llne baths, was accused of taking ad
vantage of her in a real estate deal,
answered the woman's suit yesterday
with a general and specific denial of
her charges. He says In defense of his
action that while he agreed to allow
the woman to occupy jthe premises at
127 Olive avenue, it was never under
stood that she was to have a life In
terest in that piece of realty or any of
the realty transferred to him by her,
and that her claim that such is the
case is not founded upon any Incident
or fact connected with the transfer of
the property.
Chickering claims the woman has
known all along that she occupied the
premises solely through his consider
ation for her and that It was only dur
ing the last two months, after She had
been notified that the premises she oc
cupied were to be sold, that she ever
made a claim to a life interest in the
property. Chickering says the prop
erty cost him *S500. though the deed
shows that the consideration was but
$1500. He explains this by stating that
when the transfer of the property was
first talked of the woman was In
debted to him for 51500. He agreed to
release her, pay her $1000 in cash and
assume a mortgage of J5000 on the
property, provided she would deed it
over to him.
This was done and since then, Chick
ering says, he has paid all the taxes on
the property, kept it in repair and has
allowed the woman to occupy and col
lect small rents from the premises.
Recently he found a purchaser for
the realty and when he notified the
woman that she must move, he says
he was very much surprised to learn
that she still claimed an Interest.
Health Officer Ragan reported that
out of thirty-seven dairies inspected in
Marln County one Was found very
good, -one good a*nd thirty-five bad. Of
thirteen. Inspected In San Mateo Coun
ty not one was in.good.Â«onditlon, three
being very bad. 'Three 'in this city are
bad.
In view of the urgency of regulating
the sanitation of the dairies and the
care and handling of milk by the
Health Board the Supervisors were re
quested to consider a proposed ordln-
CONDITIONS IN MARIN.
It was resolved by the board that all
the dairies of this city be characterized
as unsanitary and as such the milk is
to be regarded as a constant source
of danger to the public health.
'Five days after service of notice the
owners of dairies must begin work on
improving conditions in the dairies and
thirty days will be allowed them to
complete the same.
Bacteriologist Canney filed a report
that makes the startling^tatement that
examinations of some of the worst
dairies in this city show more germs
present than in average sewage. Can
ney requested an assistant, but there
are no funds available for the purpose
at present.
The sum of 5400 was ordered to be
expended In the Bacteriological De
partment for making tests of milk.
The Health Board yesterday sus
pended two dairy Inspectors, E. C.
Smith a'nd E. B. O'Connor, for having
reported dairies In good condition that
were subsequently found to be unsani
tary. The board decided to file charges
with the Civil Service Commission.
The resolutions adopted by the board
say:
"The Inspection of the dairies by the
Health Board has shown the condition
of dairies not to have been a question
of weeks or months, but years of neg
lect and collection of filth."
The Civil 1 ", Service Commission was
requested to certify two dairy Inspec
tors from the eligible list to serve tem
porarily in the Interim until the trial
of the suspended dairy Inspectors has
taken place. Dr. Ward, president of
the board, remarked that the neglect
of the dairy Inspectors was nothing less
than criminal and merited severe
measures.
The Health Board adopted the re
port of the committee on dairy con
ditions as filed by Drs. Harney. Po
helm and Hughes and their recom ;
inundations of rules governing dairies
and dairy depots were approved. The
rules apply to the proper construction,
ventilation and sanitation of the milk
ing sheds or barns, and milk houses,
the cleaning: of stables, precautions in
the handling and delivery of milk, the
proper care of dairy appurtenances and
to milkers and their employes.

fifty-miles and serving alike all rail
roads within the radius, regardless of
their corporate identity. The neces
sary community of interest was to be
obtained through a central board of
railroad managers, organized on line's
similar to the railroad clearing-house,
which has worked so successfully and
harmoniously for a number of years.
Mr. Bennett made the rather ambi
tious estimate of Â£150,000,000 as the
cost of electrification and figured that
another Â£160,000,000 would be re
quired for Increased facilities to pro
vide for the greatly enlarged traffic
which was to result. He calculated
the cost of working, after making the
changes, at 61.6 per cent of gross re
ceipts instead of 64 per cent, as in the
1901 railroad returns on which his es
timates were based. It is to be feared
that there is a chance of error in cal
culations Involving Â£300,000,000 and
that conservative British managers
may be a little cautious in following
out Mr. Bennett's plan. â Railway Ga

The English Institution of Electrical

M. Leplne, Prefect of Police, has now
a new sort of diving dog, or chlen plon
geur.'for service along the banks of
the river. The original dogs used by
the waterside police did not quite come
up to the expectations raised as to their
capacities, and only a very few of them
were able to assist in rescue work.
Accordingly,,, M. Leplne made an ex
periment in canine breeding, and he
has now a diving dog, which is a cross
between the Newfoundland and the
Esquimau species. The new chlen
plongeur is called the Terreneuve Es
quimau, and has the black ha.tr and
heavy paws of the Newfoundland sire
with the slender snout of the Esquimau
mother. M. Leplne will be undoubtedly
famous for his Invention and his ener
getic efforts to improve the working of
his Important department. He has,
notably, to his credit the "plunging
policemen" or "agents plongeurs," the
diving dogs, and the small flotilla of
steamboats which scour the Seine at
night, and, with the aid of powerful
electric illumination, discover river
poachers or other marauders and crimi
nals, while they also rescue persons
who have been flung over the bridges,
or who have thrown themselves Into
the river in order to put an end to their
real or. Imagined miseries. A good
many strange things happen on the
Seine between the Pont Neuf and the
Pont d'Austerlltz, and M.
riverside policemen, boats and dogs are
often the means of preventing murders,
suicides and robberies, and of bringing
to light periodically many of the mys
teries of the river. â Parts correspend

"WASHINGTON, June 4.â Much com:
ment has been caused here by the
photograph taken of ' Miss Roosevelt
at the exposition .standing very near
one of the exhibition savages In his na
tive dress, or rather undress. To the
general public this may seem strange,
but to her friends the matter Is prob
ably easily explained by Miss Roose
velt Ever since her father came to
the "White House Miss Roosevelt has
been the victim of the camera fiend,
both professional and amateur. At first
she shunned them, but later, finding
It was of little avail, she very gracious
ly allowed many to take her plctura
when requested. It Is believed the
photograph taken at St. Louis was
probably done when Miss Roosevelt
was unconscious of it.
NEW TORK. June 4.â Faults In
composition have been found in the
jrroup of photographs representing
Miss Alice Roosevelt and other distin
guished visitors recently taken at the
World's Fair in St. Louis. It seems to
have been the intention of the officials
that the pictures should be dignified
and conventional. Yet the presence of
a Filipino in the foreground tends to
defeat that object. '
Those who study the amenities of
life are wonderine what the fair man
agers were thinking of when they per
mitted this child of the tropics to re
main within range of the camera. His
attire consisted of one very slight gar
ment, evidently cut In accordance with
the summer fashion of the natives of
the islands. Friends of Miss Roosevelt
think he should have been eliminated
in the dark room or banished In the re
touching of the negative and they aro
highly indignant that the picture
should have been given circulation. If
It were intended that the Philippines
should have representation In the
group, these friends believe the object
could have been attained in a much
less objectionable manner than it was.
ST. LOUIS, June 4.â The group pho
tographs of Miss Alice Roosevelt and
party In the Igorrote village at the
"World's Fair, the scene represented be
ing the Introduction of Miss Roose
velt to . the Jgorrote chief, Antonio,
which was published . in a St. Louis
paper, is causing comment by persona
who hold that Antonio was woefully
lacking in r&irnent. (..

The "Bus" Against the "Tubes."
A showing the growth of the omni
bus traffic In London and how little
the opposition of the "tubes" was felt
after the novelty had worn off, J. H.
Moore, who presided at the half year
ly meeting: of the London Road Car
Company the other day, mentioned
that In Oxford street, below which the
Central London Railway ran, the num
ber of omnibus Journeys run by the
various companies prior to the open
ing of that railway in 1899 was 2292
a da-- * -. to-day the number was
2416 â an Increase of 124 journeys.
Mr. Moore said he had great faith in
motor cars and believed when a suit
able vehicle was found it would beat
the .tramways. â London Engineer.
Persons In search of a mission and
desirous of uplifting society might do
worse than to circulate in the form of
a tract the Post-Standard's 'account of
what happened on an' East Side car
night before-last. The ; hero of this
tale, although more or less drunk, - was
exceedingly. gallant The car was filled
with women standing up and men sit
ting down, a state of things which
grieved and pained him, so much so
that he to cause any one
of. the monsters who were occupying
the seats to vacate if any lady would
signify what seat she wanted. â¢Perhaps
the ; best.' that ' can be said for this
knight-errant is that he -meant well:
but for the credit of this community
the men who ride in street cars ought
to take heed : to the lesson which this
man was trying to teach. Otherwise our
sheet car. manners will soon be about
as bad as the street car manners of the
New Yorkers, which are absolutely the
.worst things of .the kind now on exhi
bition in : this country.â Syracuse Post-

The oldtlme almanac,' with Its pre
dictions of snow in December, cold in
February, rains in April and heat in
July, was taken half seriously in back
woods districts in America half a cen
tury ago. To-day such an almanac is
too trite a subject even for Jest. Â¦ Yet
Mme. de Thibes of Paris hag issued
an almanac, whose pretensions to pro
phecy make the humble attempts of
the American weather prognosticator
of half a century ago Eeem insignificant,
indeed- For March she predicts ex
travagant and exciting stock exchange
deals, for April, unexpected and ridicu
lous marriages and divorces; for May,
a crisis in France and the death of the
German Emperor, while Austria will be
menaced in June. It is scarcely neces
sary to go through the year with Mme.
de Thibes* list of calamities and the
"many tragic signs" she professes to
Bee for America, including "some phy
sical catastrophe which will bring
much mourning." Prophecy is an easy
business till the inventory as to re
sults and fulfillment is made out. â New

The red men of the West are good
spenders. As customers,, the store
keepers out In the border lands pre
fer them to the whites. They know
what they want and will pay almost
any old price for it. Mrs. J. I. White
lives in Porter, I. T. f where her hus
band runs a store. Porter is a brand
new town and is ' now in the boom
state. There are a great many In
dians about Parker and they are the
store's best customers.
When White went to the Territory
his wife says he supposed the In
dians would demand as low-priced
goods as it is possible to sell, but
found out that the redskins were riot
just as he sized them up. The In
dians want the sportiest things on the
market. They turn up their noses at
cheap clothes and want loud colors
and costly garbs. When Christmas
came It was natural to suppose that
the Indians would also want costly
sweets as well as costly clothes and
White was surprised, to find that the
Indians pased .- up the high-priced
candies and bought the cheapest kind
possible. The most they could get for
the money was the kind they wanted.
The Indians argued that they ate the
candy and no one saw it, but. with the
clothing it was. different^ as every one
saw the clothes they 'wore. .The red
man la much more particular, about
what he puts on his. back than what
he puts in his stomach. â New York

A remarkable accident, with a touch
of that humor which is showing itself
ever in this wonderful game, took place
in this country.. Two well-known play
ers were engaged in a close contest.
One of these, at an advanced hole of
the match, was a little down. Both had
made equally good drives, but a poor
second shot had put the player who
was behind with a high board fence be
tween him and the hole. The other
man played and placed his ball neatly
on the green. He walked onward with
all the confidence which comes from ly
ing almost dead, while one's opponent
is playing one more in a less advan
tageous position. Suddenly he saw the
other ball roll across the grass and
come to Test within a foot of the flag.
To play over the fence was almost im
possible to do with any accuracy, but
his opponent had played and made a
poor shot. His ball, however, instead
of striking the fence, had passed neatly
through a knot hole, and come to rest
In a position which enabled him to put
out, winning the hole. â Outing.
How to Act at Theater Fires.
United States Consul C. N. Daniels
of Sheffield, England, under date of
January 15, 1904, Incloses a suggestion
received by the chief of the fire de
partment In that . city in regard to
theater fires, as follows: â¢ "It is the
custom in nearly every theater, at least
in England, to lower and raise the fire
proof curtain at least once during every
performance. This curtain is not or
namental â it Is not Intended to- be â and
it only remains down for a short time.
Now, why should It not be Inscribed
There Is to be no contest over the
will" of the late Ellen B. Musser. A
stipulation signed by all the parties
to the action was filed to-day and the
case dropped from the calendar. Mrs.
Laura H. L. Dodge and Catherine Col
burn of Denver, sisters of the deceased,
who objected to the protoatlng of the
will, have received a sufficient sum to
soothe their feelings.
The trouble arose over the fact that
out of an estate valued at $26,563.25
they were left but $10 each.. while Dr.
Henry Wells Horn, who was no rela
tive, was to receive a fourth of the
estate. . T^ie sisters alleged that Horn
"ingratiated himself into the good
graces of their sister by fondling and
caressing the old lady until he gained
posseslon of her affections." She was
67 years of age and he is 30.
The will of the late Henry Hyland
was filed for probate to-day. " It dis
poses of property valued at about $18,
000. The property is left in small be
quests to twenty-six different relatives
and friends. He was an old time resi
dent of East Oakland and was 85 years
of age when he died.
The final order distributing the estate
of the late Edward Remillard to his
widow, Virginia Remillard,- was made
by Judge Greene to-day. The estate Is
valued at about $100,000 and consists
chiefly of 300 shares of the Remillard
Brick Company.
Judge Greene has held the will of
the late Thomas Carberry to be valid
and the' contest waged over.' it has
failed. The estate is valued at , $5000
and goes to Mrs. Peter Mulligan, while
Timothy Carberry, a brother, la left
without a cent. .

house to observe in case vt flre? They
would necessarily be short and to the
point, and the public in the gallery
would only have to mark, learn and
digest their portion, so that they could
be made easily intelligible. As time
goes on and the authority responsible
for insisting upon the means to be
taken for the safety of the people in
places of entertainment becomes more
severe in its requirements. I presume
it will, as far as practicable, stand

therefore follow that- the directions

Mrs. Bertha Calhoun reached Berke
ley this afternoon, and with five min
utes' good, live talking effectually de
molished the fine-spun yarn of murder,
suicide and arson which were advanced
by her neighbor? to account for her
supposed disappearance and the fire
which totally destroyed her home early
yesterday morning at 251S Telegraph
avenue. Â¦ Â¦
Mrs. Calhoun says that she has not
b*>en near her house since Monday last,
and as a consequence all those sorrow-
Ing: friends of hers who have been pok
ing: about through the charred timbers
of her home shed their tears for
naught.
'On Monday," said Mrs. Calhoun, "I
came over from San Francisco, where
I was stopping at the Lick House, and
ordered the water shut off, as my house
was vacant and I wished to spend a
brief time at the White Sulphur
Springs. On Tuesday I left for Vallejo,
and on Thursday I went to the springs.
I was not satisfied there, however, and
on Thursday I came down to the home

State !f the taxes are not paid. After
County Assessor Dalton had assessed
the water in the reservoirs of the com

fused to pay the taxes thereon, and
allowed them to become delinquent.
advice of t Attorney General
U. S. Webb, Barber placed the property
of the company upon the delinquent
list and will sell it to the State. This
will force the company to redeem or
bring suit to test the legality of the
assessment.
Mayor Olney Is of the opinion that
this case will settle the question of how
far the City Council can go in fixing
values and rates of Interest to be al
lowed the company. The Council will
stand by its valuation of $4,700,000 and
will claim that the 6 per cent allowed
the company upon this valuation is
ample.
Mayor Olney, City Attorney McEl
roy and the special attorneys for the
city, William R. Davis and R. M. Fitz
gerald, spent the whole of to-day pre-"
paring for the hearing of the injunction
proceedings that will come up before
Judge Gilbert in the Circuit Court on
Tuesday. They have taken th.c affi
davits of all members of the City
Council and of several other members
of the city government to show that
due and proper consideration ' was
given to the fixing of the valuation of
the plant of the Contra Costa Water
Company, and the fixing of the water
rates that the company does not want
put in force. These affidavits will be
the principal evidence upon which the
city of Oakland will go before Judge
Gilbert in its opposition to the demand
for an 'injunction. This work of the
attorneys continued without interrup
tion all day ai^tl far into the nigrht.

Harper was considerably under the
influence of. liquor and little credence
Is given to his story.
"I never saw this man before. He
came up to me while I w-as counting
some money I had collected arid asked
me for 10 cents. The money was not
mine" arid I- told him I would give him
nothing . ajid went^qn ( counting the
money, when I saw him swing at me.
I dodged, but did not get far enough
away." . â¢
Harper said: "I am a brakeman and
have been, working for the Mexican
Central. I have only been in town a
short tin.o and live at 762 Cameron
street. I asked this man for 10 cents
and he asaul^ed me."
In a short time both Harper and
Walker were at the Receiving Hospi
tal having their wounds attended to.
Drs. F. S. Stratton and A. S. Kelly im
mediately made an examination of the
injuries. Walker's cut was found to be
only superficial and a few stitches put
it on a fair way to recovery. Harper's
wound was more serious. The bullet
had entered the fle.shy part of the
thigh, passing under the pelvic arch.
It is expected that he will "recover.
Both are young men. Harper being
but 19 years of age and Walker 22. In
giving versions of the affair. - Walker
said:
The act was seen by a number of
men and Harper started to rundown
Eighth street toward Franklin with
the bloody knife blade still in his hand.
Policeman H. H. Caldwell happened to
be fn a barber shop near by, when he
was told of the affair. With his "face
lathered, coatless and hatless, he ran
after Harper and commanded him to
stc-p. No heed was given to the com
mand, however. Drawing his pistol,
Caldwell fired at Harper when imme
diately in front of the Tribune office,
where the newsboys , were waiting for
the afternoon papers. Harper was
seen to stagger and fell just as Cald
well reached his side.
A stabbing and shooting affair, in
which one man was cut in the neck
and a second brought down by a po
liceman's bullet, took place in the^ heart
of the city at 4 o'clock this afternoon
In sight of several hundred people.
William Walker, driver of a milk
wagon, while counting some money he
had collected on Eighth street between
Broadway and Washington streets was
accosted by Harley Harper, a young
railway brakeman out qÂ£ employment,
who asked Walker for 10 cents. His
request was refused. Suddenly Harper
made a swing at Walker with a knife,

"PLAYMATES"
THE NEXT FREE ART SUPPLEMENT WITH
THE SUNDAY CALL.
- Â¦ ' Â¦
"PLAYMATES."
E. Louyot's "Playmates" is a scene of home life which will appeal to all lov-
ers of children and pets. It illustrates the sympathy which exists between children
and their animal playmates, and suggests the charm which the ingenuous play of the
little ones may bring into home life. It shows also that imitation of what they have
observed in the lives of their parents influences in a remarkable degree their own
actions. In putting the puppy to bed in her doll's cradle the little girl is following the
example of her mother's care for her little brother, which she has daily observed.
Although her offspring seems to be an unwilling partner to the play, the canine mother
does not seem greatly concerned, for she has doubtless been often associated with the
children in their games, and knows that they mean no harm.
The picture is one which bespeaks the artist's cheerful temperament. Into a com-
monplace scene, he has infused something of the sympathy which he must have for the
homely joys of domestic life. His color also indicates a genial fondness for what is
pleasing and cheerful. It is varied and brilliant, simple and unaffected and not devoid
of refinement. There is even a certain subtlety in the placing of the blue-green and
yellow-green notes of the cupboard and the cradle together in the picture and balanc-
ing them with a mass of the blue apron on the opposite side of the picture. Effects of
studied arrangement are also to be found in the judicious placing of the various notes
of red, brown and yellow.
The works of this promising young artist are not yet familiar in this country, as
there is so great a demand that they are generally sold to collectors and dealers as soon
as they are completed, and he has -frequently so many advance orders for his pictures
that his customers have to wait many months before they can have the . satisfaction of
possessing one of his interesting productions.
His models are taken from his own householdâ even the animals, which he Is
fond of introducing into his compositions. His familiarity with them is unquestion-
Â¦'Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦ ably the secret of his remarkable success in painting them.

Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, June 4. â Influenced by heavy
realizing sales, grain markets were weak
here to-day. Initial sales in July wheat were
%c to %c up at 89Vic to 89%c. The causes of
the opening firmness were higher cables and
continued rains West and Southwest. After
the first five minutes of trading, however, the
market broke sharply, July selling down to
88%c. For some time the market held steady
around this figure. Later in the day prices
declined still further, July dropping to t>8%c,
where it closed at a net loss of lc.
Fear for the future corn crop so far as the
effect <m the corn of heavy rains Is concerned
seemed to have largely abated to-day and
there was no lack of offerings at the opening.
The close showed a rally to 49%Â®49%c, 1W4P
l%c under yesterday's final figure.
In oats, as in wheat and corn, profit* taking
was the dominant disposition. The close

A. G. McADIE. Section Director.
WHEAT â In spite of the sensational news j
from Kansas and other Southwestern sections
regarding crop damage by floods, Chicago sold
i off under profit- taking. Wires from Kansas
said that the damage to crops by water in
Â¦ the Neosho Valley was enormous and that
farmers were compelled to leave their homes
in boats.
The Chicago letter of Mitchell, Mulcahy &
Co. eald: "Cables did not respond to the
advance here yt<uÂ»rday and although there
were further hravy rains west, southwest and
northwest, and the market opened up rather
sharply, the general tone was disappointing
and the close was rather heavy. Of course,
being Saturday, and the shorts having covered
freely yesterday, there was more or less scat
tered liquidation of long stuff. While further
showers, are predicted and generally unsettled
conditions seem to prevail, holders are rather
nervous in view of the possibility of better
weather. Some reports about rainfall in
the southwest are sensational. Any material
damage does not necessarily follow. Kansan
had worse 'floods laat year and- still harvested
a large crop. - Conditions elsewhere are gen
erally favorable. Broomhall estimates the
world's shipments at 9,600,000 bushels and says
that further rains are needed In Southeastern
Europe. The weather will likely be the Im
portant factor. for the immediate future."
In this market the cash grain was firmly
held and futurca were higher, owing to the
hot drying north wind.

The market was still badly congested with
lcose black Cherries, as fresh receipts were
heavy and the carry over from the preceding
day was large. Prices were barely steady and
the top quotation was obtained only for ex
ceptionally fine lots. The market closed weak,
with large lines still unsold. The canners paid
3c per pound for black, 4(g5o for Royal Anne
and secured the bulk of the receipts of com.
mon white at the quotations. A box of small
Grren Pears came In from Tancred, in the
Capay Valley, and was offered at $1 25, but
was not sold, aa the fruit was too small and
green. Apricots arrived freely from several
sections and were easier. Citrus fruits were
active owing tb the warm, nunny weather, and
desirable sizes of Navel Oranges were closely
cleaned up.

Strawberries continued tÂ» show the effects
of the hot weather In thÂ« growing districts, a
large portion of the receipts, which were 970
chests, being sunburnt or soft. The demand
was brisk, despite the poor condition of the
berries, as retailers were purchasing freely for
the Sunday trade, and prices had a sharp ad
vance. Some very poor lots of Longworths
Hold below the minimum quotation and occa
sional salea of fancy large berries were report
ed at a small i premium. The canners were
still in the market for large kinds and were
paying $2 per cheat, but were unable to secure
many. The other berries were reported steady
at about previous prices. Currants were very
dull and carrled-over lots sold below the quo

The week closed on a well srrpplled *n* easy
Butter market, but quotation* showed no
change. The present hot spell will probably
result in the receipt of a good deal of soft
and out of shape Butter during the oomlng
weak.
Cheese remains the same. Los Angela* Is
taking some for storage at 8%o cased, or So
net. but as that market wants nothing but
the finest new goods for storing the move
ment is not large. Still. It helps. - The local
trade say that the only condition that can
reduce stocks Is the holding back of shipments
front the factories to this market.
Eggs closed the week very firm as to fine
ranch, with some houses quoting a cent over
the top quotation below, and it Is possible that
prices may advance again during the coming
week. . Store Eggs are getting poorer as the
summer advances, and dealers are complain
ing of the large percentage of rotten ones
now being received. Eastern Eggs are com
ing In freely and are actively competing with
store Eggs.
Receipts were'96,200 lbs Butter, 1422 cases

COFFEE â C. E. Blckford's circular gives
the receipts at this port during the first five
montho of the year at 120,22t> bags, against
177,761 bags during the same time last year.
The sales from -first hands were 90.859 bags.
against 109.775. The stock in first hands
June 1 was 49.305 bags, against 93.043. The
circular says:
"Receipts from Central America continue
unusually light, the deficit to-day as com
pared with the same date of last year being
52.305 bags. Nearly halfâ 23.831 bagsâ is to be
attributed to the short crop in Costa Rica,
while other sources also show important re
ductions â in round figures, Nicaragua 2200.
Salvador 7000, Guatemala 15,300 and Mexico
4300. While the crops are not entirely out. the
movement hits sufficiently progressed to form
a fair Idea of the total season's receipts hare.
At this writing it is believed the present dis
crepancy will be practically maintained, or
possibly somewhat ' Increased. In certain sec
tions of Guatemala, however, open transporta
tion was retarded at a critical period through
labor troubles and other causes and there may
be a considerable quantity of Coffee there to
be sent out in all directions if it can be done
before the rainy season sets tn.
"Business has been very quiet and quota
tions are not altered In any particular. De
liveries from first hands during the month

THE FUTURE REVEALED, THE PAST
DISCLOSED.
The Present Analyzed by Livingstone.
PROF. LIVINGSTONE'S readings are like
a living page of Flammarlon's treatise that la
bo electrifying the world to-day. He Is no
Imitator. His work Is upon original lines,
pure thought, clear vision. -He tells you what
you desire to know and works In the open
light.
I He la as conspicuous for his wonderful oc-
cult analysis as he Is for his original ex-
pression and vivid truthfulness.
A test reading Is not a life reading. When
you call on PROF. LIVINGSTONE he will
give you a full life reading for $1. A test Is of
little value; when the mind Is troubled you
need morn substantial aid and advice. This
Is Just what PROF. LIVINGSTONE gives
you when you call on him for a flrst-class
clairvoyant reading.
He asks you no questions, but tells you
what you wish to know.
He does not mention all the Ills and mis-
fortunes you are heir to. You are acquainted
with the facts In your case. Let PROF.
LIVINGSTONE analyze the matters that are
troubling you, find the cause of trouble and
suggest the remedy.

for potatoes of any sort, but even that

Even vulcanized rubber, which, owing
to the sulphuric process to which it was
subjected, was formerly valueless, i3
now subjected to a process which re
juvenates it and makes it fit to be
worked up again for the purposes of the
manufacturer. Immense quantities of
this product, which formerly was as
signed to a rubbish heap, are now
treated and admixed with a certain
percentage of new gum, enough to
cheapen the price of moat rubber goods
turned out by the manufcturers to-day.
Old rubber, however, can be used by
itself without any addition of fresh
gum, the process of treatment being a
simple one.
Worn-out rubber, like worn-out sil
ver, is something that does not exist
in these days. Ever since the advent of
bicycles and motor cars, both of which
drew heavily on the world's rubber
supply, and ever since the hundred
and one uses to which rubber is put
in connection with electricity, the ma
terial has become more and more scarce
and valuable, so that even the old rub
ber shoe and the worn-out rubber boot
may throw out their chests in pride at
being worth really something. Noth
ing containing rubber is discarded
nowadays. The old rubber coat over
which the spring tires of a motor car
may run on a country road to-day may
some day find a nesting place in the
soft tresses of a woman's hair, after
having been transformed Into a hand

you need, have, you? Don't you see
that It's very foolish of you to put
yourself in danger in that manner?"
Sitting in the little waiting room
of the court half an hour later, both
boys were silent. They had' evidently
been pondering over the words of the
Judge. Not so much reverence as
might have been expected was heard
in the voice of the smaller boy as he
suggested to the other:

"Only-4ince the last foundation of the
German empire in 1871 has it been pos
sible to even think of 'shipping politics,'
or. an Imperial maritime policy. Dur
ing the flrsj fifteen years of this new
empire the protection afforded to Ger
man shipping Interests was more of
the nature of a' passive than a positive
one. In v 1881, ten years after the Ger
man confederacy had .. been founded.
Prince Bismarck, then Chancellor of
the empire, presented a memorandum
to the Reichstag that provision be made
for the payment of an annual sum
to steamship companies. Such a. bill,
having "first been introduced in the year
1884, was finally passed on the 6th of
April, 1885. It provided that the Im
perial chancellor be authorized to make
an agreement with steamship compa
nies to establish, for a period of fifteen
years, a steamship service between Ger
many, China, Japan and Australia.
Shortly afterward the imperial chan
cellor "(Bismarck) made a contract
with the North German Lloyd and the
Hamburg-American line for a fort
nightly steamship service, three-fourths
of which were to ply from Bremen, un
der the .Lloyd, and one-fourth from
Hamburg, under the Hamburg- Ameri
can, to China and Japan; a monthly
service between Bremen and Australian
ports,, as well. as two branch linesâ one
maintaining', regular ; monthly sailings
from Hongkong, China, to German and
Dutch ports in Australasian waters and
the other a bi-weekly, service from
Trieste to Alexandria vla^Brlndlsl. The
ships for these lines were required' to
be built in German shipyards, of steel,
and to have at least 6000 r*;tric tons
register They were to maintain a
"On' the other hand, however, the de
velopment of the United States, the
emancipation of the Spanish colonies,
the recognition of property rights on
the high seas by the taking of extreme
measures to prevent piracy, and the
Paris declaration of 1856, forbidding
privateering, were important factors In
fostering the growth of the merchant
marine of the German states. The
great progress which has been made in
the means in communication has also
furthered it, there being more or less
of a reciprocal action between the
growing industries and the means of
transportation. The Increase in the
former, creating a demand for tech
nical improvements In the latter, has
necessarily led to the establishment of
new maritime enterprises. In addition
to the above there are two other fac
tors which have had a far-reaching ef
fect upon Germany's merchant marine,
namely, the economical and political
confederations Into which the German
states formed themselves. The forma
tion of the 'Zollvereln* (German cus
toms union) in 1828, of which all the
German states have finally become
members, making it possible for com
mercial treaties to be made with for
eign powersâ a thing which was for
merly Impossible â Is that referred to as
economical confederation. The political
consolidation consisted in the German
states being formed into an empire,
which enabled the imperial government
to further the common Interests of the
states by encouraging foreign trade,
by granting export premiums and
granting direct or Indirect subventions,
to establish ocean steamship lines."
Shipping: Politics.
"Not only was the Napoleonic epoch
disastrous to European industries, but
commercial interests were seriously
crippled thereby. The continental sys
tem (November 21, 1806), as well as the
compulsory military service system, In
troduced by the French Emperor, was
extremely detrimental to the shipping
trade. With the downfall of Napoleon
(1815), (he first Impetus was given to
the numerous German states toward
maritime navigation. The growth
thereof was at first slow. Tin English
navigation act, which was finally re
pealed In 1819, and the unfavorable
maritime laws of the Netherlands and
Spain occasioned this slow develop
ment. Again, all ships, many of which
were German, had to pay. Denmark
'sound dues' for the use of the Baltic
Sea up to the year 1857, when they were
abolished, only, however, after Den
mark had been handsomely compen
sated for the loss of her ' monopoly.
Hamburg Vas additionally handicap

by the kingdom of Hanover upon all
boats on the Elbe; as was Bremen, in
the same manner, until 1821, the. Grand
Duchy of Oldenburg collecting toll from
all craft plying upon the Weser."
Regarding the growth of the Indus
try under the German methods of pro
moting its usefulness, he says:
Growth of Merchant 3Iarlnc.
Napoleonic Epoch Disastrous.
"Germany, of all world powers, with
the exception of Russia and Austria, is
the one with the poorest natural
means of communicating by sea with
the outside world. ; However, in spite
of this (act she holds to-day an envia
ble position In the world's carrying
trade. She Is advancing in the science
of traffic upon the high seas, under
difficulties of no small proportions,
faster and more effectively than any
other power. The Germans consider
that the paramount factor In develop
ing a country's foreign trade is, per
haps, the merchant marine, and that it
is just as neceesary to foster foreign
trade as to encourage home Industries.
An extensive report has been received
by the Department of Commerce and
Labor from United States Consul
Brainard H. Warner Jr. at Lelpsig.
Germany, dealing with the German
merchant marine. The report gives a
history of the methods in operation in
that country in assisting the merchant
marine of the empire to maintain a
high standard of development. . It deals
with every phase of the system, both
on inland waters and in intercontinen
tal traffic, gives a careful review of the
shipbuilding operations of the country
and shows the financial conditions of
all the companies operating from Ger
man seaports. Consul Warner begins
by saying:
A call was sent for a neighboring fire
company, and a ladder was raised
against the side of the building where
Saeger clung to the sign. Marshal Sey
ferllch mounted the ladder and at
tempted to loosen Saeger's hold, but
Saeger clung to the board. With the
aid of an ax handle the firemen finally
broke Saeger's grip.
Saeger threw his body against the
ladder and the fireman barely saved
himself from falling. Saeger was then
drawn into the hotel and taken to the
police station. He fought violently all
the way.

window of the Northland Hotel. 26
North Clark street, early to-day, but
he was grasped by the legs and saved
from death by two men. Saeger's
weight drew the men down to the win
dow sill and their holds were strained,
but they clung to his feet almost fif
teen minutes, unable to draw him back
into the window. When Saeger's down
ward flight was checked he seized a
signboard that "was within his reach
and held to it with a tenacious grip.
He not only checked the efforts of his
would-be rescuers, but made their task
doubly difficult by Jerking and kicking.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Numerous correspondents have asked
for information as to the pronunciation
of the names which figure in the' war
news. It ; would be impossible in any
brief compass to give satisfactory rules
for ths pronunciation of Russian
names. Generally speaking the vowels
are sounded as follows: "A" as in
"far"; "e" as in "met";."i" as In "ma
chine"; "o" as in "tone"; "u" as in
"rude." Initial "o" often has the sound
of "a"; thus "Orion"' is sounded as
though spelled "Arloff." An "e" in a
final syllable often has the sound ot
"yo" in "yoke," so that "pravezh" is
spoken as though spelled "pravyozh."
The consonants have much the same
force as in Englishâ "ch" as in
"church"; "sh" as in "wish": "kh" as
"ch" in the German "lch"; "ff" as "v";
final "z" as "ss." So far as Japanese,
Chinese and Korean names are con
cerned similar rules prevail. In the
original the names are not spelled at
all, but are expressed with word signs.
In English, therefore, they have been
expressed phonetically. They are thus
to be pronounced as they are spelled.
Many of them havrf alternative spelling
but these need caus"e no uncertainty asÂ«
to the pronunciation, since the various
spellings all express the same sounds.
Thus Che-Foo Is also spelled Chl-Fu.
But we need only to remember that the
"i" in the latter form has the con
tinental sound of long "e" to perceive
that both forms are sounded the same,
as though spelled Chee-Foo. So Kin-
Chow Is also spelled Kln-Chau. But
the latter Is a German form and in
German "au" Is sounded like "ow" in
English.â New York Tribune.

During the week besinninp June 2T>
the branch of the Supreme Court sit
ting at J-'arntogji -will hear testimony
j>rofTered by Charles A- Kavanaugh,
the wealthy Waterford, X. Y., manu
facturer, who invested in about $75,
Â©00 of the securities of the ill-fated
'shipyard* combination, to ths effect
that he was deceived and misled by
jirospectuses circulated by the pro
moters and financiers. There were
two of these prospectuses, one dated
[April 19, lf'02, the other dated June
3 4 of the same year. The names of
those influential financiers Interested
in the formation of a combination of
the leading American shipbuilding
concerns differ in these two circulars.
The terms of the proposition are dif
ror.t, too, and the second plan was
much more comprehensive than the
original one.
Kavanaugh sues the Mercantile
Trust Company of this city: Colonel
John J. McCook of the firm of Alexan
der & Green, le^al advisers of the
United States Shipbuilding Company;
Alvin W. Krech. then president of the
Mercantile Trust Company, of which
Alexander & Green are counsel, and
feveral other individuals, alleging mis
representations.
Those interested in the shipyards
combination are preparing & vigorous
defence. Kavanaugh has as nis coun
sel Edgar -T. Brackett of Saratoga
County, who is known as a relentless
foe. It was he who last spring wished
to have a legislative investigation not
merely of the shipbuilding company,
but of all similar concerns that stirred
the financial community during the
boom times of 1902-03. with a view to
recommending restraining legislation.
As laie as last week there were per-
Fistent rumors that a settlement had
been effected with Kavanaugh and it Is
known that Senator Brackett had been
In this city almost continuously dur
ing the last month, but he has insisted
that it is a public duty to have this
matter probed to the bottom. With
that end in view Samuel Untermeyer
fcas been retained to conduct the cross
examination in the Kavanaugh suit.
James B. Dill has joined hands with
Untermeyer and Senator Brackett In
pushing the Kavanaugh suit.
SCBW YORK, June 4.â Succeeding
th<? recent calm in the multifarious liti
petion srov.ing: out of. the collapse of
the United States Shipbuilding Compa
*ry. a storm is about to break. The
formal lepal rroeeedlngrsÂ»-looklns to the
reorganisation of the concern alons the
lines of the compromise have been go
ing along placidly enough. The routine
necessary to the foreclosure sale of all
property from Maine to California
jirlor to the acquisition of the plants by
the new interests concerned has been
almost completed, but one disturbing
element is still active.
