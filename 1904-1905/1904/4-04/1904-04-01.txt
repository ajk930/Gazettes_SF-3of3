WASHINGTON, March 31.â Secretary
Hay has checkmated with a. refusal an
unusual order of The Hague tribunal of
arbitration in connection with the re
cent Venezuelan arbitration. It was
agreed by eight "peace powers," of
which the United States was one, that
the costs of arbitration should be paid
by the peace powers if their contention
that thoy should â¢" collect claims as
quickly as the allied powers â Great
Britain, Germany and -Italyâ was not
sustained. Vice versa, the allies. should
pay the costs. â¢ -''
The verdict was in favor of the al
lies. The Hague court attached to it a
vcrdirt directing that the United States
should collect the costs of arbitration
and turn them over to the court. This
would have involved extensive, repre
sentations by the United States to; each
of the other "peace power?."
Secretary Hay decided that ! the
United States was not the bailiff of The
Hague court, that there was no good
reason why the court should pick out
the United States for such a duty, and
he therefore has sent a declination to
perform It- The action of, the court; in

Hold Conference
With Friends
of Parker.
Serious consideration will be given
the compromise offered by Tammany
Hall. It is doubtful, however, whether
.It will be accepted. Judge Parker's
friends, who hav* talked with many of
the most prominent Democrats in both
houses to-day, have discovered the sit
uation to be as stated this morning â
"Let New York instruct for Parker and
the conservative Democrats will do the
rest: but first let New York instruct."
They were told the Democracy of the
country was looking to New York to
end all doubt and uncertainty. The
party was really to follow the lead of
Kew York in its selection of a con
servative candidate.
Southern Democrats said that they
must quickly know that New York was
positively going to instruct for Parker
or they would have trouble in a half
dozen States'
The reports will be taken back to New
York by friends of Judge Parker, and
they will figure in the conferences yet
to be held regarding the acceptance or
rejection of Tammany's compromise
proposition. It probably will be re
jected.
This resolution was outlined by the
râ¬-r-rc5cntatlve - or Tammany Hal!,', who

such an expression from the convention
than to have a, fight on the floor over? j^

iation of Charles F. Murphy, and it
would also show to the country that
there was serious dissension, as is usual
in Presidential campaigns, between
Tammany Hall and the Democracy of
the rural counties. It â¢ was ex
piaine:" 1 . to the friends of Judge Parker
that while they could undoubtedly pass
resolutions of instructions by a good
majority, the very fact of a division
would be hurtful to their candidate. A
merely commendatory resolution would
unite all factions, would serve Just as
good a purpose and would prevent divi
sion.
WASHINGTON. March 3LâTam
many Hall has offered to compromise
in its fight against instructing a dele
gation for Judge Parker. The details
wer discussed here to-day by friends of
Judge Parker and Charles F. Murphy.
Tammany's compromise is that the
convention should not pass resolutions
of instructions, but that the friends of
Parker be satisfied with complimentary
resolutions,- which might be accepted
s* tantamount to putllng Judge Parker
forward as a "favorite son."

\A later account of the first engagement says: "Â¦"Â¦While the forces were face to face on the op
posite sides of- the walls which the Tibetans had built across the highway to oppose the advance,, the
Jndian troops quietly deployed their flanks and effectively inclosed 1500 Tibetans in a circle, like
herding sheep. The members of the mission, press correspondents and the general staff rode up to in
spect the capture and were laughing and talking. ''' They were unaware of the" impending tragedy, being
evidently heedless of the sullen demeanor of the Tibetans. ;\^ --
"The' latter presently began to hustle some Sikhs, who replied with the- butt ends of "their
rifles. .Then a Tibetan fired a pistol, wounding a Sikh, and this was the signal, for. all the Tib-;
etans ; to draw their swords and rush at; their captors, who opened fire on the surging mob. The
officers emptied their revolvers. The Tibetans were unable" to climb the wall which they them
selves had built. Finally about half of them were able to break away to the rear, where they came
uricler'the'fire of the artillery. Of the entire Tibetan force only about half " escaped, being either
killed or. wounded." â¢ . s N
The Tibetans lost heavily, owing to the inferiority of their weapons, which were matchlock
I rifles, but they displayed the greatest courage, many pf them coming on even after they had been seri
ously wounded. After the action there were heaps of dead and a long trail of dead and wounded ex
tended to the rear.
- After a short halt the advance continued. Nearing the Tibetan camp at Guru, a second action
took place, in which the artillery played the. larger part.
Finally the Tibetans retreated over the hills, with the exception of about sixty, who obstinately
held the village, which was finally taken by a bayonet chafrge.
;r Â¦''Â¦Â¦Â¦ Among the Tibetans killed was the Lassa general, the military commandantpf Phari and Lata
and the representative of the Gulden Monastery; to whose influence and violent hostility the existing
difficulties were largely due. '..
The Tibetan losses are believed to be more than 400, while British casualties were a dozen.
The British force returned to Tuna this evening and stated that rifles bearing the Russian im
perial stamp and. Russian ammunition were found on the wounded Tibetan officers.
Natives Hemmed In When Attack Begins,
The Tibetans numbered about 1500,'and theirresistance of -the effort to disarm them led to a
smart engagement. The situation for a- few. moments was critical, Colonel Macdonald 'and Colonel
Younghusband being only a few yards from the advancing Tibetans. Revolvers and bayonets were
used, and then a rifle fire was resorted to, at which the Tibetans fled, but not before several casualties
resulted in the British ranks/ tl^X.

TUNA, British'lndia, March 31.â News has Seen received here of severe fighting, the Tibetans
having attacked the British mission under Colonel Younghusband. There were two engagements and
the Tibetans were repulsed with heavy loss. The British captured the Tibetans' camp at Guru.
While the British advance had practically been unopposed, the expedition suffered great hard
ship from the intense cold and it was* sometimes found impossible to work the Maxim guns and rifles,
owing to the congealing of the oil. The country was of the bleakest, without a sign of vegetation, and
the expedition had to face piercing winds and clouds of dust, while there was a heavy fall of snow
At 8 otlock this morning a-flying column started to reconnoiter the Tibetan camp at Guru,
whereupon a general from /Las sa. with a quaint retinue, came to interview Colonel Younghusband.
The general asked the colonel to retire with his mission to Yatung for the purpose of carrying-on ne
gotiations,.threatening to attack if the mission proceeded. Colonel Younghusband replied that nego
tiations had been proceeding fruitlessly for. fifteen years and that retirement was now impossible:

while a third reports the arrival of
100.000 Japanese at Inkan. Finally
comes the most unnecessary assertion
that Sweden has no aggressive inten
tion, her modest warlike demonstra
tions" being merely what she deems
necessary for the preservation of her
rights of neutrality and not In any
way meant as pin pricks for Russia.
CHEFU. March 31 (from Chemulpo,
March 28). â The lull in operations of
the Japanese land forces, which, except
for slight skirmishes in the vicinity of
the Yalu River, have not yet come Into
touch with the enemy, is' due to two
causes. First, the weather, which by
the breaking up of the ice and the melt
ing snows has caused a state of affairs
v.hlch is seriously hampering the Japa
nese movements. Naturally this condi
tion was foreseen by the Japanese; nev
ertheless It is much worse than was an
ticipated. The landing of troops has
been a tedloua and dangerous proceed
ing, which has not progressed with the
dispatch expected. Secondly, the Mi
kado's forces are advancing in most
circumspect and methodical fashion-

St. Petersburg Hears of Plot
to Overthrow the Ko
rean Dynasty.
The Russian troops in Manchuria, in
cluding Port Arthur and Vladivostok,
now number 245,000, and the total may
be 300,000 by the end of April and 500,000
by September, when, if the Japanese
have not crossed the Yalu, General
Kuropatkin- will advance and drive
them out of Korea. 4
The only fear in high quarters, ac
cording to the writer, is the inability
of China_ to restrain the mass of her
troops or 'to prevent troops landing in
a 1 Chinese port In the event of Japanese
successes.
General Kuropatkin has telegraphed
General Mlshtcheiiko to av^id any en
gagements in Vhich' the security of- the
Russian sidte would be 'uncertain.
PARIS, April 1.â The MaUn> corre
spondent at Harbin says troops are ar
riving continuously, each day seeing
4000 decsend toward Kirbln and farther
south in Manchuria by road and rail.
The correspondent says that more
sotnias of Cossacks are expected.
The Journal this morning prints an
interview which its correspondent in
St. Petersburg has had with Secretary
,Ou of the Chinese legation there, who
is in daily communication with Peking.
The secretary said that China was de
termined to remain neutral so long as
the Chinese frontiers were respected/
Considerable excitement, the secretary
said, had been caused by Chinese who
were creating disturbances within the
area of military operations. All was
quiet in Southern China, where the re
lations between the Chinese and the
European residents continued to be
good. The secretary added that the re
ports to the effect that the Japanese
were enlisting Chinese were untrue.
The St. Petersburg correspondent of
the Echo de Paris says that the wife of
one of General Kuropatkin's orderly
officers hag received a telegram from
her husband saying that the general
: 'staff does not believe that there will be
lT!Ty great battle before September.

The account received from Chefu yes
terday of the sinking of the Hanyei
Maru says she fell in with some Rus
sian warships on the morning of SUn
day. March 27, off the Miaotao Islands,
between* Port Arthur and Chefu, and
was sunk by them after almost all her
passengers had been removed. One pas
senger, however, and the captain and
an oiler of the Hanyei Maru remained
on board. These three men are reported
to have clung to floating wreckage un
til they were rescued by; some Chinese
fishermen. They eventually reached
Tengchow.
Three of the crew of the Hanyei Maru
concealed themselves on . board when
the Russians came over to remove them
and later escaped in a Junk from the
sinking vessel.
The Japanese generally pronounce
this affair to be a barbarous breach of
the laws of nations and of humanity.
TOKIO, March 31.â The action of
Russian warships in sinking the Japa
riese coasting steamship Hanyei Maru
last Saturday is deeply resented by the
Japanese. In official circlesyfhe attack
upon and the sinking of this vessel near
Taichin Island are pronounced to have
been a clear violation of the neutrality
of China, besides being an act of wart"
tonness against a defenseless craft. The
sinking" of the Japanese steamship
Nakamura Maru by the Russian Vladi
vostok squadron near the Taugaro
Straits is recalled. *
The Hanyei Maru was an old steam
ship of sixty-four tons, and had been
chartered by some correspondents of a
Japanese newspaper. After transferring
ten Japanese and seven Chinese from
the Hanyei Maru the fire of two vessels
was directed upon the steamship, and
one of the Russian torpedo-boat de
stroyers sent several shells through her
hull. When she appeared to be sinking
the Russian ships started at full speed
in the direction of Port Arthur.'

says, the Japanese are justly proud, i
"The maneuver .was covered by a tor
pedo division which, running in close,
endeavored to .draw the fire of the land
batteries from the main enterprise.
This division remained in action until
ell the rrews were rescued and just
before daybreak was engaging a Rus
pian destroyer - which remained at the
rntranc*Â». firing torpedoes during the
night. The scream of escaping. Pteam
proclaimed that the Russian boat had
b*en damaged in her vitals.
"At daybreak the flotilla drew off
under cover of the fleet which was
waiting ten miles outside."
In closing the correspondent de
pcribes the bravery and the death of
Commander Hirose, who had recently
"It was a horrible melee, but the
Jepanese kept their presence of mind
throughout and their steadiness was
fchown by the fact that before she had
been fouled by the destroyer the
Yeneyama Maru r>assed to the star^"
board of the ChJyo Maru and then
between her and the Fukui Maru and
reached the . center of the channel,
where sho was hit by a torpedo,
which sank her on the" west side of
the channel, her bow pointing toward
the shore. "Sot a- man on -the trans
port was drowned.
CHANNEL PARTLY BLOCKED.
'The enterprise failed completely to
block the channel because there were
only four transports. It is probable,
however, that the . channel has been
rendered impracticable for the large
battleships and it is certain that the
Japnnese will not rest until the chan
nel has br>en closed.
"So close were the defending de-
Ftroyers that the Yeneyama Maru was
fouled by a Russian destroyer and her
crew, was Fcorched by the flame of the
discharges from a Russian six-pounder.
"The Fukui Maru ntxt passed on the
port t!de of the Chiyo Maru and, drop
ped anchor. Just as the officers and
rrt-ws pushf-d clear there was a dull
explosion. She had been " struck and
sunk in the. exact place which the
Japanese desired "by a torpedo from
within the harbor. ' /
"It w%s just at 3:30 in the morning

searchlight beating upon her, and she
was a target for a hundred puns to

fuses were s*et and the crew pushed

suspense. The charge exploded, sink
ing her 100 yards from a point of the
cast Fide of thfi" entrance.
SINKS IN THE EXTKAXCE.
"The -moon disappeared at midnight
and the sea was lik? glass when the
desperate enterprtW was begun. When
within two miles of the goal the fren
zied motions of a searchlight showed
that suspicion had been awakened, and
suddenly a solitary gun announced that
the Japanese had been discovered. The
Russians sprang to the guns of the
batteries and in three minutes the Jar>
rneye craft were inclosed in a sen.i
circle of gunflshes. The sea was
churned to a turmoil by falling shells,
but there was no hesitation. The tor
ppdo-boats opened out and the trans
ports, with the men standing at the
lifeboat statior.s. steered directly into
the inferno. There was then only a
mile to traverse and the safety fuses
were ready.
LONDON. April 1.â A correspondent
of the Times at sea, in a wireless tele
gram" via Weihuiwel, describing the
last attempt of the Japanese iy bottle
up Port Arthur, says :
"Alter the bornbardment of .March

Bishop McKim's proposal was at once

of the Choshu' clan, subscribed ..52500

gave $1000 each and Count Inouye,
Count Matsugata, Count' Okuma and

pany; D. O. Blake, of the American
Trading Company; Professor J. O.
Swift and Count Kabayama, president
of the Soyeda Industrial Bank, were
appointed a committee to take charge
of the fund. >r r
Count Matsugata proposed cheers for
the President of the United States, and
Minister Griscom replied by calling for
cheers for the Emperor of Japan. There
were demonstrations of. satisfaction
when the total of the subscriptions was
announced and the meeting was
brought to a close with the singing of
the national anthems of the United
States and Japan.
Bishop McKim, of the American Epis
copal mission, suggested the organiza
tion of the charity. He said the mem
orial to Perry would be graven not on
a pillar of stone, but on the hearts of
two great peoples. Charity was be
yond the pale of politics, the speaker
continued, and this movement had no
significance except as an appeal to
those broad humanitarian sympathies
which make a universal brotherhood
over all the earth.
Count Okurna, at one time Japanese
Premier, made the principal address
at the commemoration exercises. He
eaid that as the Japanese became more
familiar with the people of the United
States they could not but admire them
for their love of justice and humanity,
which were such prominent national
traits.
The fund v.ilP be turned over to a
Minister, of the Imperial household,
and it will be disbursed under the di
rection of the Emperor of Japan, par
ticularly for the purpose of aiding the
destitute families of soldiers and sail
oas.
TOIL'O, March 31.â At a meeting of
Atnei^ans and Japanese held in this
city to-day in commemoration of the
fiftieth anniversary of the signing of
the Perry treaty between Japan and
the United States, an American war
charity, called the Perry Memorial Re
lief Fund, was organized with much
enthusiasm. The sum of 27,500 was
subscribed at once, and it was decided
to organize committees in all of the
larger cities of the United States.

LOS ANGELES, March 31.â Acting
under orders from Chicago, the local
officials of the Santa Fe Railroad sys
tem have taken precautions to pro
tect the company's property against
the results at a threatened strike of
serious proportions, which, if it occur,
will affect the entire system. Accord-
Ing to advices from Chicago, all of
the machinists, boiler-makers and
roundhouse employes of the company
are preparing to strike next week if
negotiations now in progress for a sat
isfactory working scale are not brought
to a desirable and immediate termina
tion. For more than two months the
leaders of the machinists' unions and
the leading officials of the Santa Fe
system have been holding conferences,
but no compromise has been effected
satisfactory to both sides, and now the
men threaten to strike.
There is every indication that the
company will resist the efforts of the
strikers and at various places on the
Western divisions of the system
stockades have been erected with a
view both to protecting the com
pany's property in case of violence
and as a place of refuge for the men
who may be employed to take the
strikers' places. The leaders of the
unionists state that within the past
month more than 300 of their mem
bers have been laid off and their
places filled by non-union men and
one of the demands made is that these
men be given back their places.
In Los Angeles secret arrangements
have been made to offset anything
that the strikers may do. More than
twenty men have been engaged for
service at a moment's notice and have
been informed that they are to ride
on all engines leaving the roundhouse
and otherwise safeguard the com
pany's property.
It Is known that the brotherhoods
of trainmen, engineers and firemen
have refused to take part in the trou
ble and the switchmen here have not
rendered any decision, that having
been left to their general officers,
Â¦whose headquarters are in the East.
Locally the proposed strike would af
fect about sixty men.
Last Obstacle in Way of
Transfer of Property to
United States Is Removed
â ?
PARIS. March SI. â The first civil
tribunal of the Seine to-day decided
the case of the Republic of Colombia
against the Panama Canal Company
In favor of the defendants. The de
cision holds that the complaint of Co
lombia is not receivable and condemns
the plaintlSs to pay the cost* of the
action. This decision has the effect
of removing the legal obstacles in the
way of the transfer of the canal con
cession from the company to the Unit
ed States.
The cot:rt announced that the otner
case rplative to Colombia's right to
hold 60.000 shares of stock will be
heard April IS.
Vlthough no flnal notice of appeal
was fc-iven it was seated at the close
of the court that Colombia and Bon-
F.parte Wyse (.the original concession
aire) would appeal.
It is said that an appeal will not
raU s<> delay, since to-day's decision is
held to confirm thÂ» company"* full
ripht to transfer to the United States.
The other suit relative to Colom
hias right to hold shares does not af
fcct" the United States. Therefore it
is the view at the United States em
bassy and in other official quarters
that* to-day's decision clears away the
last obstacle in the way of the trans
fer of the canal to the United States.
The decision is a lengthy document,
fully reviewing all the early circum
pmnces of the commission and setting
forth the various acts of the Colom
bian Congress, the treatie>. etc., prin
cipally articles -0. 21 and 22 of the
treaty of March 20. 187S. whereby the
company acquired its rights.
"These articles." the decision says.
â¢ have the manifest purpose of assur
ing the full exercise of sovereignty
ovr the canal. It results from what.
i-= established before this tribunal that
Â« 'nioir.bia in not In possession of terri
tory traversed by the canal. By com
!-?r before the French court in order
to obtain its rights over the canal.
Colombia tacitly rvdmits its inability
tn itself control the canal. It there
fore follows naturally that it has lost
m>vereUrnty over the territory travers
ed by the canal. It also appears that
this sovereignty is maintained by the
rew republic of Panama, which is in
actual possession of the authority and
jinwer of administration and of police.
Under such circumstances it only re
mains for the Panama company to.
accept the actual situation of author
ity and the fa<-ts relative to the ter
ritory embraced by the concession.
Therefore the action commenced by
Colombia is not receivable."
The decision concludes with the
ppecific recital under the French code
that none of the claims set up by Co
lombia are valid; that its request to
enjoin pending actions is not warrant
ed; that its plea for costs against the
< ompany is not justified, and that the
entire costs of the procedure are as-
K.-ss^d against the plaintiff.

It is thought from the . haste
of the masked men in cutting
away the forward engine and
leaving the scene of the holdup
that the}' did not take time to
secure the contents of the safes.
It is thought the robbers were

The train was crowded with
passengers, who should have ar
rived in San Francisco about 10

as can be ascertained none of the
passengers were injured by the
explosion or visited by the three
masked robbers.
O'Neill, the murdered mes
senger, was about fifty years of
age. The passenger train was or
dered to remain with the single

from Sacramento. The officials
here stated that, .their, .first care

quarantine from fifty clergymen of his
diocese who had gone down the bay
to'' meet. him.
. "I had three. long private audiences
with his Holiness," said the Archbish
op. "He is the third Pope I have known,
and it seems to me he enters more into
details than either of theVothers." This
is due, I believe, in a large' meaure to
his having gone through 'every grade
of priesthood. One day -I handed his
Holiness some statistics/which I natur
ally'thought he would put .'aside, to read
at his leisure. To my' surprise,, he took
up the paper immediately, read it
aloud, including the figures, and com
mented thereon.
Siteial D'epatch to ThÂ« Call.
"I have" said that the intention of
the testator is of no consequence if
he did not do those external acts which
the statute requires t to make a valid
will/ But suppose that, in a matter not
clearly^ within the j four corners of : the
will, he has disclosed an intention that
a given paper should .not have force
or be used as a part of a probated will.
The cases, it. seems to me, must be
"rare, if they exist at all, where such a
paper would be or should be incorpor
ated in. a will.
"Now, upo-n this sealed letter is found
NOT A PART OF THE WIIjLi.
"The sealed letter has been offered
as a part of the will of Mr., Bennett,
the will itself having first >been ad
mitted and proof having been made
that,',: the letter was found with the
will. Its admissibility is purely a ques
tion of law for the court. No ques
tion arises regarding the effect of the
letter as creating a trust, nor does any
question j arise at -this time as .to 'Mr.
Â¦Bennett's, intentions or the
stances under which the "letter was
written. The question, upon the face
of the paper, as it now stands before
the court, is: , Did Mr. Bennett take
'such steps as under the laws of this
State made the letter, prima-facle, at
least, a part of the will? The statute
as to the execution of wills provides
that no will or codicil shall be valid to
pass any estate unless It be in writing,
subscribed , by the testator and at
tested by three witnesess, each of them
subscribing in his presence. .
"The first objection is that the ad
mission of this letter.- would violate
this statute, because the letter itself
is testamentary in character and not
executed as a will.
"But there are other grounds of ob
jection, which, upon the' assumption
that an extraneous testamentary docu
ment may be incorporated in a will
and- so entitled to probate, are equally
fatal i to the claim of . the appellant.
The sealed letter is not described in the
will with sufficient certainty; the lan
guage of the will is 'for the purpose
set forth in. a sealed letter which will
be found with this will.'^Kothing what
eVer.to identify it; no earmarks upon
It which will show that it was the let
ter that the testator had in mind when
he put his name to that will, and it
was witnessed.
. "It is also a- grave question -here
whether a letter is referred to as al
ready in existence. And the letter it
self, it will be observed, refers to the
execution of the will as a past com
pleted transaction.
Judge Gager said in part
OPINION OP THE COURT.
An Interesting feature of the day's
proceedings was a statement which
Bryan made in court that he was will
ing to- give a bond that in no case
would the money mentioned in the
seale'd letter go to himself or his fam
ily without Mrs. Bennett's consent.
NEW HAVEN, Conn.. March 31. â
A finding that' the sealed/ letter,, by
which Philo S. Bennett: expressed a
wish that $50,000 should be eiven to
William Jennings Bryan' and his
family, was not a' part of the last will
of Bennett was returned by the Jury
to-day in the Superior Court in the
trial of Bryan's appeal from the de
cision of the Probate Court. This find
ing, which upholds the decision of the
Probate Court, was given in* accord
ance with instructions to the Jury
from. Judge Gager, who presided, at
the Superior Court trial. Judge
Gager's ruling, on a question which
has never before come directly before,
the courts of Connecticut, decided that
the letter could not be admitted as
evidence in the trial.
The decision followed arguments
which had occupied most of the pre
ceding two days of the session regard
ing the admissibility of this letter as
evidence, counsel for Bryan ' contand
ing" that it should, be admitted, while
the attorneys for Mrs. Grace I.-Ben
nett, the widow, 'and other heirs pre
sented -.opposing arguments. As
Bryan's appeal was based on the ex
clusion of this letter as a*. part of the
bill in the Probate Court, the decision
of Judge Gager that it could not be
admitted as evidence practically con
cluded the proceedings in the Superior
Court, and the jury * was accordingly^
directed to bring in a verdict against
Bryan.; An ; appeal will Â¦ be taken to
the Supreme Court by. Bryan's counsel
on the ground that " the letter should
be admitted as a part of an estab
lished trust.

and without show of ;en^ion that she
inaisted on a verdict from the 'twelve
men on the present panel there was
no alternative left for. Judge Cook or
the District Attorney. Diy^itiPf action

District Attorney Byington was re
luctant to be interviewed on the sub
ject of Juror Goetjen's alleged mis
givings. The jury had been accepted
by the defense^ he said, 'and further
disctlsslon was in bad taste as long as
the case was pending. i
$, "I will state, however, that, the deV
fense has waived. every claim to im
propriety on thepartof the jury,"^ho
said, "and if it should return a ver
dict of guilty Mrs. Botkin must abide
by the \ issue. She. can ne-ver \ plead
that the jury was improperly com
posed.
"As to" whether or riot we are sat
isfied With the jury I cannot say. We
have accepted. the panel and must try
the case before it. It is not the prop
er time to discuss the personnel of
the jury while the case lsf pending."
Attorney George A. Knight was
frank in his statement that Mrs. Bot
kin's demand for a verdict from the
present jury excluded all claims for a
reversal from the Supreme Court on*
account of the unfltness of one or any
of the jurors to pass on the issues in
the case.
"Mrs. Botkln's statement in op&n
court," he said, "removes any conten
tion of that kind. She is willing to
have the issues tried by the jury ac
cepted by both sides. I stated yes
terday in court that the defense wish
ed the jury discharged. In this mo
tion the prosecution concurred. I
was unwilling to haVe the' case de
cided by a body of men on whom the
least taint of suspicion rested.
"After the adjournment of : court I
held a consultation with Mrs. Botkin
and told her plainly that I could not
devote three . weeks more to the trial
"immediately: "I ; have many , important
civil matters to attend, and 1 have been
forced to neglect these during this trial.
After I had told her this she said she

Judge Cook on Tuesday evening
c learly foreshadow*^ his willingnvss to
dismiss the Jurj- and lÂ»Â»*Rin with a new
I>anpl. To this no objection was en
tered, and Attorney Knight for the de
fense made a motion that the jury to?
discharged. It was concurred in by the
prosecution, and lhe Judge all but
made the necessary order. Finally he
announced that he wished to look up
authorities so that the order would 1*'
in proper form. Then the jury was
placed in the custody of the Sheriff,
with the understanding that it was to
lÂ»e discharged in the morning on the
reconvening of court.
ACCEPTS THE .IFRV.
The surprise came at the opening of
the morning session. The jury was not
present in court, having been- conduct
ed Into the jury-room by the under
eheriffs by order of Judge Cook pending
the preliminary proceedings. Attorney
Knicht arose and said in an unusually
quiet tone:
"May it please the court, the defend
ant, Mrs. Cordelia Botkin, refuses to be
bound by the admission and motion of
her attorneys yesterday, and says she
â¢will not be bound by it and she is here
to speak for herself, and I will .with
draw that motion and Mr. McGowan
will concur in the statement."
"I concur in the withdrawal of the
motion," said McGowan.
Judge Cook turned to Mrs. Botkin
and asked her if the statement were
true. There was surprise in his manner
and tone. At a nod from Knight, Mrs.
Botkin arose and in a clear voice said:
"Independently of any influence or
advice from my counsel, I demand a
verdict from this jury."
'V:V N'O ALTERNATIVE LEFT.
The statement from the ' defendant
left no alternative for the court. The
panel must be accepted on the demand
of the defendant. Otherwise she could
properly plead that she had been once
In jeopardy, which claim had been ex
pressly waived by her attorneys on the
preceding day.
Assistant District Attorney Ferral In
terjected a nrmark in the hush that
followed the statement of Mrs. Botkin
which started the proceedings going
again.
"I suppose your Honor will withdraw
the remark you made," said he, ."that
you would set aside a verdict of guilly
if obtained?"
"Of course," said Judge Cook.
"That was made in view of what was
stated here yesterday?" continued Frr
ral.
The Judj?e ignored the question. Then
Etill In tones of doubt he said:
"If. they, want to proceed with this
Jury, very well. Call the jury in."
The Jury was brought 4nto the couft-

Chief Wittman said yesterday that no
further, attempt was being made by the
police to locate the alleged briber who
approached Juror Cioetjen with an offer
of $50 to 'hang" the jury. There is an
air of unbelief about police headquar
ters that Goetjen was ever seriously
flppr.oac.hed jwith_a bribe, and.his.. state
ments are taken with incredulity. The
bare fact that the juror on the night
that he claimed to have been ap
proached imbibed fifteen drinks of
whisky ' between his journey from the
Hall of Justice to his place of business,
at Fifth and Folsom streets, is a mat
ter of police record, and the belief is
expressed that the alleged- attempt at
bribery was largely the result of in
dulgence In drink.

with poisoning subsequently and pend
ing to Mrs. Dunning. Mrs. Price stated
that the defendant had complained of
being ill that day and requested that
lunch and dinner be sent to her room.
She was much surprised to see that th-.
defendant had been out and remarked
about it at the time.. 'Â¦>/..
Miss Llvernash J was a reporter in
1S98 and interviewed Mrs. Botkin in.
Healdsburg and Stockton before and
after her arrest for the murder 'of Mrs.
Dunning. Witness stated that 'Mrs.
Botkin had admitted her intimacy with
John P. Dunning and had given him
anything but a good character. -
HER VIEWS OX DUN'XIXG.
"He is a racetrack gambler and a
spendthrift," she is alleged to havo
fcaid. "He drank so hard that I was
compelled to support him and lie prac
tically~used up all the money I had."
After the arrest of Mrs. Botkin and
her arrival in this city the witness
claims to have Interviewed her, dur
ing the course of which conversation
the defendant expressed great joy over
the fact that Dunning's child had not
died from partaking of the poisoned
candy.
Joshua D. Deane, husband of one of
the murdered women, was recalled and
testified that on the night of August 9,
1898, when the poisoned candy was eat
en, his wife had not partaken of the
trout served at the evening meal arid
was not in the habit of eating fish at
all. This testimony was introduced to
refute a theory of the defense that
the death of the two women was due
to ptomaine poisoning from seating fish
on the night they were taken ill. When
Deane had been dismissed without
cross-examination Byington made the
announcement' that the prosecution
rested.
Before allowing^the prosecution to
close its case Judge Cook announced
that he would rule that the testimony
of Professor Price regarding his analy
sesÂ«*of the candy obtained from Chief
of Police Lees was not admissible. He
based his ruling on the fact that too
groat a laps? of time had occurred
between the murders and the analyses
and that the death of Chief Lees had
precluded a proper identification of the
candy which was subjected to tests by
Professor Price.
Attorney Knight was unwilling to
proceed with the defense in the after
noon and on his motion an adjourn
ment wa3 taken until this morning., /
SHERIFF GUAKDS JURY.
Before adjournment Judge. Cook an
nounced that he . would continue his
order made the previous day commit
ting the Jury to the ;,- custody- -of the
Sheriff. Then he turned to., the' Jury
and- delivere " the following instruc
tions:
Now, gentlemen of the Jury, before adjourn
ing at this time, I wish again to admonish ycu
ft* to your duties and to state to you right
How that no juror should draw any conclusion,
cither for cr egalnfct either party In this action,
by reason of the court's action In ordering the
Jury Into custody for the remainder of this
trial. The law impose* upon the Judge of a
court a discretion which he may exercise at
any Urn* during the trial, either to allow the
Jury to separate at *ach adjournment or: to
keep them together. It is within the power of
the court to keep Jurors together from the time
a juror is sworn, until a jury is completed.
The law provides that at any time during 1 the
coarse of the trial that the Judge sees -fit to
exercls*? that discretion he can do so, either
cllow the Jury to separate on the adjournment
or to keep them together in the custody of a
sworn officer. In this case yesterday it was
stated; here In the presence of the jury the
court' waÂ« asked in. the presence of the jury,
if there was. any reason for Us action in mak
ing thl* order; the Judge stated at that time
of course there was a reason. The court Is
not In the habit of acting without some reason,
but you must not consider that reason to reflect
either 'on the. - i*>ople- or on thÂ« - defense. The
court often hears matters that don't come. to
the ears of ' the Jury and such matters may
cause the court out of precaution to prerent
anything happening which ought not to hap
pen. ,

Trustworthy information comes from
Washington, D. C, \6 the effect that
a place Jn the Cabinet will be. tendered
to Representative Victor' H. Â¦ Metcalf.
In the event of success -in
the Presidential 'election next Novem
ber.'* In a recent conversation with a
prominent Californian the President
expressed the hope that the leading
men of the State would recommend
some eminent and available Republi
can for a~ place in the Cabinet.- .-.The
impression was. distinctly conveyed
that a man of the Metcalf type would
be acceptable. There is sure to be un
der President Roosevelt's second ad
ministration a hew man for Secretary
of the N'avy, as Mr. Moody cannot
much longer afford *io neglect impor
tant* business affairs to serve .the
country. It is "said also that the official
duties devolving upon the Postmaster
GeneraJ have so impaired zhe health
of Mr. Payne that his retirement from
the Cabinet is onjy a. question of time.
A suggestion that' Senator Perkins*
career as sailor boy, State Senator,
Governor of California' send United
States Senator might be brought. Ib a
pJorious finish" as Secretary of the Navy
did not evoke much applause at the
White House.. Commendation of Vic
tor H. Metcalf s public service and
special ability was* happily, received.
Theie is not the slightest doubt "as'
to Mr. Metcalf's high standing in the
estimation of t.he â¢ President It Is
known to several* men that the Presi
dent would cordially welcome a.unani
mous request from leading Republicans
of "the Pacifir- Coast for* Mr. Metcalfs
promotion to Cabinet honors". . .
â¢ John F. Swift would have been ap
pointed to the Cabinet under the Har
rison administration if the leading Re
publicans' of California and Oregon
could have Ijeen brought into line in
â¢his behalf. The active | men of -the
party on this coast' deemed It expedient
or right to commend M. M. Estee for
the -high place, but President Harrison
Was not able to concur in lheir.judg
ment. , The President, one evening after
dinner, at the White House, told Mr.*
Swift insrt many words that he -de
sired- to recognize the claims of Cali
fornia and would' welcome a Swift in
dorsement by the Legislature -'of 'the
State. The' Legislature subsequently
indorsed Mr. Estee and "the President
promptly named Mr. Swift -for United
State's Minister to Japan. "This â¢*asin
fulfillment of a premise made* to the
latter that if the California Legislature
did not indorse him for the Cabinet "he
would be named for the- mission to the
Orient. ' ?; V;

as soon as McEnerney asked about the
regulations governing land entries and

found themselves brought to a stand
still for want of the records and other
papers, a wagon load of which were
safely, locked up at a hotel. As Heney
placed all these at the disposal of the
defense, an early adjournment was tak

deep into the documents. The hearing
will go on at 10:30 o'clock this morn

FIMPLE ON THE STAND.
Following the Commissioner's ruling,
On the matter of constitutionality, so ably
argrucd by Mr. Wheeler,.! have not changed
my belief that the Jurisdiction of the court
should not be questioned' by an inferior tri
bunal. The arguments I have heard have
not satisfied me that the court at Washington
had not competent jurisdiction. The safe rule
for me hag been laid down by the courts in
the following language:' "The commlastoner
should -consider whether the indictment in
substance and not necessarily- with technical
accuracy, charges a public offense. Â¦- All doubts
should be resolved in favor of the Govern
ment especially as they can be solved by
the Judge In the district or by the court
where the Indictment was found." Hence, if
I am wrong in assuming that the Supreme
Court of the District of Columbia has con
sidered this question, it can be raised before
the Judge here who will be asked for the
writ of removal or before the court at Wash
ington.- "â Â¦ Â¦ ' â¢ ' ' â¢ Â¦'.
â¢ The most serious question here is presented
by the claim that, the Government . is obliged
to nroduce its evidence, especially In view of
the presence of the. witnesses. But I find that
the uniform usage of the court favors the
rule that a prlma-facle case .only, is required
to be. made out in advance by the prosecu
tion. This. I believe, is independent of the
<iuÂ«-stion whether It Is made out by primary
or secondary evidence. There Is no. decision
to. the contrary in- the reports. The defend
ants.' moreover, are ' In no worse position be
cause . the . Government's witnesses are here
than if tht*y wern not oresent. So I am in
clined to hold that the Indictment was prop
erly Introduced in evidence, and that It is
not necessary', to sustain it- by further testi
mony in /advance at evidence to contradict : it.
â¢'.On behalf cf-the defendant. Henry P. D!
mond, it has been urged that the complaint
should be dismissed as to him because the
indictment Â¦ falls properly to allege any guilt
upon his part. But on reading the Indict
ment we find Â¦ it is specifically charged that
he acted as the agent of Hyde and Benson
in all their acts committed ' In furtherance
of their < alleged conspiracy, and with full
knowledge of . said conspiracy, and with the
Intent to aid. them therein. In every Instance
the overt act charged In .these thirty-four
counts Is alleged to have been committed by
him. I do not know how language could have
been stronger.
I will therefore -deny the motion as to each
of the defendants, and will now permit the
defendants to Introduce testimony.

:':Â¦; ONLY A SUGGESTIOX.
But It Has Proven of Interest and
Value to Thousands.
Common sense would suggest that
If one wishes to become ileshv and
plump it can only result from the food
we eat and digest and - that food
should be albuminous of flesh forming
food, like eggs, beefsteak and cereals;
in other words the kinds of food that
make flesh are the foods which form
j the greater part of our daily bills of
! fare.
But the trouble is that while we eat
enough and generally too much, the
stomach, from abuse and overwork,
does not properly digest and assimilate
it,, which is the reason so many peo-
ple remain thin and under weight:
the digestive organs do not complete-
ly digest the flesh forming beefsteak
and eggs and similar wholesome food.
There are thousands-, of such who
are really confirmed dyspeptics, al-
Â¦ though they may have no particular
pain or* inconvenience from their
stomaehs.
If such persons would lay their
prejudices. aside and make a regular
practice of taking, after each meal,
one or two of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tab-
lets the food would be quickly and
thoroughly digested, because, these
tablets contain the natural peptones
and diastate which' every weak stom-
ach lacks, and by supplying this want
the stomach is soon enabled to regain
â¢its natural tone and vijror.
Stuart's 'Dyspepsia Tablets digest
every form of flesh forming food,
meat, eggs, bread and potatoes, and
this is the reason they so quickly build
up, strengthen and invigorate thin,
.dyspeptic men, women and children.
Invalids and children, even the most
delicate, use them with marked ben-
efit, as they contain no strong, irri-
tating drugs, no cathartic nor any
harmful ingredient.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets is thÂ«*
mpst successful and ' most widely
known of any remedy for stomach
troubles because it is the most rea-
sonable.and scientific of modern med-
icines. "^ . ' â¢
Stuarfs Dyspepsia Tablets' are sold
by-every druggist in the United States
arid Cana v da, as well. as in Great Bri-
tain, at .50 cents for complete treat-
ment. â¢ Â¦
Nothing further is required to cure
any stomach trouble or to make thin,
nervous, dyspeptic people strong,
plump and well..

THE success of the Salvation Army in its coloniza
tion experiments in this State and on the Arkan
sas River has led to the presenting of a bill in Con
gress to take the colonization of the poor, now congested
in cities,' into the hands of the Federal Government .The
bill provides a commissioner of colonization to.be the
head of a bureau in the Interior Department and for the
issue of $50,000,000 in bonds, the proceeds, of which. will
be loaned to colonists and the principal and interest will
be met at fifty years maturityby. a sinking fund consist
ing of the surplus interest! The Government," that. is to
say, will charge enough more interest than it pays to
cancel the is.sue in a half century. The bill is long and
elaborate, providing Â¦ for limitation of the amount "of
land each â¢ colonist can take and working out all of the
detail. It is drawn by Consul Booth-Tucker, whose ex
perience qualifies him for such a ; task. Â¦

plate of glass to be converted into. a
mirror is polished on both sides, then
laid on a perfectly level table of great

smooth stone, made â¢ like a billiard
table with raised edges. A sheet or
sheets of tinfoil sufficient to cover the
upper surface of the glass are then put
on and rubbed - down smooth, .after
which the whole is covered with qul -
silver, which immediately forms an
amalgam with the tin. The superflu
ous mercury is then run off and a wool
en'cloth Is spread over the whole sur

a day, and night- then the weights and

â¢ The interests concerned, direct and collateral, are try

serve the navigability,- of the Sacramento and San Joa
guin and at the'same time correct their drainage capa
city;'-Two important- commercial cities arc concerned in
this,' Sacramento and Stockton. Some of the plans pro
posed to correct the Sacramento are objected to on the
ground that they will impair the navigability of the San
joaquin, which of course is injurious to Stockton and
perhaps to the impregnable reclamations on the south
tide of the San Joaquin. . . â¢Â¦ c. . .' â¢
.The engorgement of the'Sacramento is said to be be
low Rio Vista and various plans' have been suggested to
correct it.- The senior- of these propositions. 'is for a
canal through the Montezuma hills. Â¦ This was, we be
lieve, first proposed by General Green of Colusa,' who'
has been an observer of the river from, the earliest set
tlement of its valley and is a capable engineer. Subse
quent study has led him to abandon the Montezuma. ca
nal, because the fall. at its lower end is insufficient to
.effect its purpose. Yet. all of the water that overflows
the levees on the west side of the river and. all of the
drainage from that side is forced back into the river by
the Montezuma hills, to be backed up by the stricture,
south of Rid Vista. All plans end in this,- that that ob
struction must be in sonic way corrected.
..To the end that something may' be done and' that a
waste of words may not be added to a waste of water it
is proposed that a convention of all interests be held to
organize for effectuating sortie plan. It., is : true that'
many years may go by without another flood like the
present. But that will only add to. the' loss when .it
comes, as it surely will. With a v -nse of security bred
in long immunity, the value of Improvements increases
and. the risk rises. At present this water question is in
the air. Man3 r have plans withevt reasons for them and
..The charge' of mutiny against six
teen sailors of the. U. S. S. Nina, sta
tioned at San Juan, Porto Rico, has
been- dismissed' and. the crew has had
.Commander W.-G". Cutter arrested and
held- on a charge of illegally depriv
ing .the' men- of their liberty and
"threatening j them with deadly wea
pons.' 'The story is briefly that the
Nina was loaned to the Porto Rico
lighthouse board, arriving at San
Juan last December with a crew whose
term of "enlistment had nearly ex
pired.. . The men claim, and so proved
before the .commissioner, that they
were induced' to sign a paper which
they were told- by. the captain was only
a signature for. pay,- but which proved
â¢to- be' an enlistment for one year in
the navy: When. the. Xina_ was or
dered ' to Pensacola the^ crew refused
to work and were then driven to the
naval ' barracks at the point of bayo
nets and locked, up. A. hearing before
a United States commissioner, brought
but the fact that the crew had been
deceived. and Cutter Was. made to give
$1000 bond for his appearance to an
swer .the. .charges of shanghaiing.-.
â¢ Another evidence f>f the necessity
of establishing some; consistent and
rational pay for officers in the navy
has been presented by Civil Engineer'
Asserson. He was retired January 5,
190.1, by reason of age, and went on
the retired list with tTre rank of rear
admiral, a-nd pay of $4125. He milde
implication for active service and. as
the. navy was short of civil engineers
he -was. kept at the' Brooklyn. -navy
yard. at his former duty. When pay
day came around Asserson found that
he was losing mo'ney by this new.ar
rangement-and that he was receiving
only $291 67 a. month â the active.
duty .pay of a .civil 'engineer of. over
twenty years' service â Awhile his..re
tired- pay 'as -a" 'rear admiral-was
$3*4 3 7.5 .'a month- for doing, nothing,
raaking a.' sacrifice ,ot 1625 a-- year.
Mr. Ass.erson appealed to Congress for
relief and. a favorable report has been
made by the Naval Committee. ' It. is
â¢one iif- -many .'instances, where .rank,

for that is about the proportion in which the pro'cess

X.OS ANGELES, March 31.â A syndi
cate of wealthy property owners inter
ested in the business section in the
neighborhood of the" courthouse have
sent Attorney John G. Mott to Wash
ington ; to offer to the : United States
Government a free site for the million
dollar postoffice for which an appror
priation has been made.
For 'more than two years the Los An
geles postoffice has occupied temporary
quarters as the result of a. wrangle'
over a site. The- Government con
demned a block of property adjoining
the old site, but : the legality of the
proceedings was" successfully attacked.
Since then various proceedings have
been Instituted. In order to- prevent
the placing of . the proposed, building
near the southern limits of the busi
ness center, the syndicate will offer
the property known . as the Downey
block at Temple and Spring streets
free to the Government and will pay
for it and for the removal of present
buildings by mutual assessments. The
scheme would involve - an expenditure
of something like $490,000, but the plan
will be vigorously opposed by owners
of property in other sections of the
business part of the city. . ;.;

LOSING AGAIN BY A HEAD
PORTIiAXn IS SHUT OUT.
For the Third Successive 'Game Its
Men Have Failed to Scope.
LOS ANGELES, March 31.âShut
outs are the regular order of things at
Chutes Ball Park - these days. Port
land has played twenty-seven innings
against Los Angeles and has the first
run yet to make. Wheeler's pitching
and the splendid fielding of the cham
pions were responsible for the string
of ciphers in , the Portfand column to
day. Thlelman pitched a strong game
for the ' visitors, but was* not given
good support. The enthusing feature
of the game was a remarkable catch
by Center Fielder Bernard. of, the Los
Angeles team. Castro . sprained - his

threw true to the plate and it. was all

The game " was ' nice and fast and 
looked like real baseball In every round.
Oakland worked off. three lightning
double plays that reminded the fans of
the. champion infield of 1902. . Ganley

possible chances and * 'did -some fast

while, but jan error now and then, aided
by a timely hit or so. proved the down
fall of.."Chames." The "Oaklanders hit
him when they needed runs and they
also got a few runs without the aid of
hits.
Schafley took a walk In round two
and Mr. Streib laid down a bunt.
Whalen thought he "could catch Schaf
ley napping and threw to second. The
runner tore into third sack while the
ball was being chased out in center
field. Brick Devereaux tapped one
smartly over, the same cushion and on
this bingle Scbafley arrived. Â¦ â¢ '
Two were added to the Oakland
score in the sixth. Kruger smote the
leather out beyond the reach â¢ of
Whalen. Dunleavy had one that put
a dent in the score board and earned
for him three bases and also sent
Kruger straight home. Schafley tried
lo sacrifice. Whalen could not pick the
ball up and so Schafley was cafe. As
soon as he got on the bag he started
for wcond. While they were trying to
Bret him between the two stations the
lively Dunleavy did the hotfoot to the
rubber.
The natives took an aerial voyage in
the last period. So badly rattled were
they that Pete's men came around
three times on two hits and an. error

double play instead. San Francisco

SIX RECORDS
BKEAK
Of an otherwise colorless card the
refreshing return to form shown by
Byronerdale, in* the closing number,
was the* feature of the sport yester
day, at Oakland. Travers, who is now
in the Eastern country with his kit
of tools, rode Jack, Crane's horse in
a race on the 25th inst. and was strong
enough to finish fourth on him. Pierce
J., it is claimed, was the real parcel
of merchandise on that occasion, but
things miscarried somewhat because
of the nominee being almost left at
the" post. . â¢ .
There was a very wise play on By
ronerdale yesterday and after leading
throughout, he disposed of The Fret
ter, the 9 to 5 favorite, by -half a
length. Â¦ . '
Mountain rode the latter with the
same skill and finesse that a car driver
would display leading an orchestra. He
waited until the -street lamps were
lighted. before setting down good and
hard to ride, and was beaten on the
better horse. Mountain has been in
the business long, enough to ' k-now
what time it is. and flagrant exhibi
tions of misjudgment**]ike this will
not add. to his popularity.
Galaiithus, the mount of Buxtoit,
went Jjack 'in the betting from 8 to 5
to 21. to 5 '.with such rapidity as to'
crush another coast* record. He.fin
ished third, of course. ' ; 'â¢ - '' : â¢:

she was not placed. Northwest, an

'SHELL MOUNT WINS AGAIX. -
With a purse, to his credit the pre
vious' day, Shell Mount came right back
and captured the third event, closing
favorite aÂ£ 13 to 5. After Educate, the
pacemaker, had shot her bolt, Holbrook
hustled the favorite along on the out
side and in a hard drive earned a
head decision over Marelio. Otis fin
ished a bang up third on the rail with
Aunt Polly. The latter mare met with
poor .racing luck on ihe back stretch,

Disappointment fell- to. â¢ the lot of
many persons who assembled in Judge
â¢Fritz's' court- Wednesday evening to
listen- to testimony in the case of- Max
Katzauer,- charged -with having re
ceived certain, property which lie- knew
had been stolen from q. .Southern Pa
cific freight car. But a surprise was :
sprung: which more, than cbnVi>ehsa.ted
for the failure to examine witnesses.
- The hearing had been continued -from
the morning session and when ail was;
ready for the. opening of- the. evening
performance Attorney. -Allen, for â¢ the
defense, suddenly produced a writ of
prohibition- which he had secured f rom
â¢Superior Judge Kerrigan during the in
terim, on "the ground that on December
S, 1904, the defendant had been held to
the Superior Court on exactly the same
charge which Judge Fritz was there' to
hear against him..' This' announcement
was followed by an'-applicatlpri-. for thq
release of. Katzauer on habeas corpus,
and Attorney Kelly, for the prosecution,
was apparently very much' startled. uy
the suddenness with which the-opjtosir
tion had operated. ..- .;".".-
The whole matter will be" heard .he
fcre Superior Judge Troutt. on., April S:
After they had been married twenty
three years it occurred to John Mysano
and wife that their mutual happines3
would be .promoted by .separation,- "so
they began dwelling apsjrt, the grown
up children' of the couple- accompany
ing the.mother. That was three months,
ago; and the in'cerirn was apparently
less brimful of bliss tj>an the disunited
ones 'had expected,- for last Wednesday
they met in the office of a local attor
ney ..with the announced purpose of
effecting reconciliation and a resumj.%
tron of doubje harness! While the ne
gotiations were.. In progress- the" wife
said or suggested something that- ftetr
tied the husband;- with the result that
he smote her and -their adult son witii
art umbrella, for. which he was arrested
arid charged wiih assault. After the
facts .had been fully explained, to Judge
Mogan -he took them ujider advisement
and will ha.nd down a decision -to-.day,.
W. J. Cameron, known in police, cir
cles as "The Terror of- Point Lobos,"
was arrested several ' weeks ago for
running ' amuck .in. that suburb and.
scaring some of the residents thereof so
badly that they still shudder when they
recount their experience..- Charges of at
tempt to kill and carrying a deadly
weapon were entered against the man.
and the "case was assigned to Judge
Mogan's court. "With the intention of
making as respectable an appearance in
that tribunal as he could with the aid
of purchasable auxiliaries, "The Ter
ror" applie.d for and obtained permis
sion to go ' forth and equip himself
with a clean collar, and that was the
last seen of him in the Hall of Justice
until yesterday,* when he was afrested
and sent u.n for arraignment.
'.'I'm afraid," said Judge Mogan, "that
the conduct of tho defendant in this
case has prejudiced me to such an ex
teAt that it would be better for both qf
hs and mom in # the line of justice if he
were tried in another court. So I will
transfer hte casa to. Department No. 4,
where I. am sure he will be given fair
.. Having thus averted a conscience- *
trying oordeal, his Honor "turned" to* the
case of Mary Fogg.^eharged with ipetty
larceny iind "vagrancy, and heard the,
tale i}T Frederick Fellv,. the complain-'
irig witness. .It was the oft-told story
of man's trust ami woman's perfidy.
They met in a Kearny _ street home of
Terpsichore/ where Mary Fogg nightly
tripped the light fantastic and led her
partners to the bar, where she permit-t
ted them to treat her to- liquid refresh
ments. After she Had danced and im
bibed with Frederick Felix " until his
legs were wobbty and his brain reeling
he counted his cash and found that It
?9 50 less than it would have been if
some one had not gurreptitiously dis
possessed him of that sum. It* Jarred
his feelings to suspect Mary Fogg qf
dishonesty, for In the matter of drinks
and dance's her deportment "had been
integrity, personified^ buf there was no
other target at which his suspicion
could be aimed with even a "shadow, .of
reason. So he had .her arrested by Pa
trolman Holmes.
"I'm an hopest woman," was the de
fendant's plea, "even if I -do work on
percentage."
"Percentage of what?" inquired-, the
court.
"Percentage of the drinks I sell."'..
"The fact of your worhing on ' per
centage'^does not prove you honest any
more than It convicts you of dishon
esty,"" was the Judge's finding; ."but
the evidence of this complainant and

Piscia, but denies firing a shot. He
alleges that Piscia is wanted in Bos

years of age. He became a sergeant on

;SIay 5. 1SS4. His record has been an
"honorable one, and his bravery and
efficiency at all times won for him the
admiration of his brother officers. \'fi
The retirement of Captain Dunlevy;
will be follovred by the promotion, of
Lieutenant Joseph J. Burnett, who is

The assignments are in- the hands M

was' reached, between him and the board
that he w'ould retire' at the next quar

A party of prominent Santa Fe of

Morton, traffic 7 director of the com
pany; Freight Traffic Manager W. B.
Biddle, Passenger Traffic Manager
George T. Nicholson, General Freight
Agent Edward Chambers- and General
Passenger; Agent ' J. J. . Byrne, arri ved
from Southern California* last evening
and registered at the St. Francis. With
President E. P. Ripley. who remained
with his family in Santa Barbara, the
party has been making a tour of in
spection of the company's western sys
tem and came north over the San Joa
quin Valley ""division. Vice President
Morton stated last evening that he ex
pects to remain here about a week and
he added that President Ripley would
come north before returning to Chi
cago.
"Business in the : West," said Mr.
Morton. Vis all that the railroad com
pany could ask for. As for the Santa
Fe, it has been carrying a lot of freight
out of California and getting Rs share
of west-bound business. We are look
ing forward to a lively time during ...e
coming conclave of Knights Templar
in this city, an event, which, we be
lieve, will be the biggest California has
ever had. In fact the demand for roll
ing stock has surpassed all our expec
tations. We are hurrying to comple
tion the new "hotel in Colorado Canyon,
which will be open in time to.accomo
date the Knights Templar. In antici
pation'of this business and that accru
ing from the annual conference of
Methodists in Los Angeles, the Santa
Fe is constructing : at the canyon a
large sidetrack for the accommodation
of many special trains, which will
come west that way,, so that visitors
may live In their cars if they are so
inclined."
Mr. Morton said the Santa Fe has
all but completed Its plans for hand
ling deciduous Â¦ fruits from Northern
California. . It has leased a river
steamer, which will ply between Sacra
mento, Antioch. and Point Richmond,
â¢gathering freight for the main line of
the company. Regarding this year's
orange business, he stated that the
growers had been seriously handicap
ped by reason of the terrific storms in
the Eastern market points, which had
prevented the product from being dis
posed of at its customary price. He
denied all' knowledge \ot any compaqt
between the Southern Pacific and the
Santa Fe 'companies, whereby they
would jointly, use the California North
western* Railroad for traffic " purposes.
In fact, he 8aid.\ the engineers of" the
Santa Fe ' are stHl busy, on the plans
for: a new . road . from Eureka to .San

An assistant to President Foster on
the coast road will probably be se

Superintendent Schindler was In. con
ference, with President Foster for some
time yesterday. The former Informed
the head of. the California Northwest
ern that he had received an offer direct
from Henry E. HuntjngtoTi or the posi
tion of general 1 manager of the Pacific
Electric Railway; Company of Los An
gele?, now held by Epes Randolph. The
latter, It > Is reported,' Is a very sick
man, arid for that- reason he Is prac
tically making his home in Phoenix,
many miles from the scene of opera

head. From what can be inferred from

ements beyond the stage of fumigation
be condemned and torn down, and that
