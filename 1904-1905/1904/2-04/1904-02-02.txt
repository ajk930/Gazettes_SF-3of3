ferent sets of arm muscle's in,*o"j>lay: .â¢ .
Jeffries in training J uses a' com'bina-
tion of the tattoo and the! rigftt-l<jft
lead on the second rebpund. T,t is an eVc"-'
cellent exercise for both speed and hird
hitting, and is done as follows: * 'He
strikes the bag vith his right on the.
first rebound (the right har* blow, be-*
ing the heavier),. then, -k-ts the" bag. r,e-.
bound once without striking it, and.
with his right hits it on the second reÂ«*'
bound, following this with a harder
blow f.-om the left on the first rebound-..
He moves the weight cf the body in"
such a way that the Becond j'.ow after
each double rebound shall be the more"
forceful, thus alternating in force from"
left to right arid back again from right"
to left. â  :!
Xext, gauging your distance, s.ving;
for the bag with your left, as if the
leather sphere were the side of your op-Â»
ponent's head. Swing exactly as -m
regular boxing, striking the br\g on *he
side, midway between top and bottom.
On the second rebound swing with your
right, and thus alternate. A swing
travels too far and is thus tflo slow
to permit of hitting on the nrst re-*
bound. You may even be unable to
strike on the second rebound. If so,
try it on the third, alternating left
right, left-right as long as you can con
tinue to pui force and precision into
your blows. ;
You will be astonished to see what
tremendous power you can put into a
swing when there is no fear of hurt
ing any one and no danger of being
blocked or countered.
Hit the bag squarely â not with an
upward or downward twist. In ae
livering heavy blows care should bo
taken not to stand too close to the
bag. Learn to gauge your distance, to
â¢step in and out as though in a regjlar
boxing match, and to keep on the
move all the time. Do not stand still
and punch, but side-step, advance, re
treat, etc., etc., constantly.
Remember, also, that if the tag
moves awkwardly or files' off at the
wrong angle, the fault is all yours.
Keep your temper and try to do bet
ter. While your sparring partner may
hesitate to remind you of your defects
and may take on himself the blame
for your mistakes, the punching bag
will show you no such consideration.
It reflects your skill or lack of skill as
truthfully as your mirror reflects your
face.
Swing's and hooks cannot, of course,
be practiced on the double-ender bag.
The sides of the doorway prevent free
scope of the arms in dealing circular
blows. But on each variety of bag all
the "straight" blows known to boxing
may be used.
Everything in bag punching depends
on striking the bag at the proper angle
and at exactly the right moment. Your
blow should land as the bag is swing-
Ing: toward you and while it is as near
ly as possible in the center of the ring.
Stand close to the bag and lead with
right or left (not too hard at first); as'
the bag rebounds toward you, do not

well filled and the contents, "were in

cipal were young shoots of the fir and
pine; a quantity of young fir cones.'/Uso
in a chewed state, were mixed with the
moss."
Evidence that man and the mammoth
were for a considerable time contem
poraries comes from various quarters.
In Siberia, twelve feet below the sur
face of a cliff which stands 136 feet
above the present level of the river
Obi, a skeleton of a mammoth was
found, associated with numerous flint
implements, indicating the presence of
man, while 'the large bones of the ani
mal were split in the usual way of sav
ages for extracting the marrow.
In numerous places in Europe the
bones of the animal have been found
both In the river gravel and in caves
associated In a similar manner with
flint implements, while the picture of
the mammoth carved upon a piece of
ivory in prehistoric times found in ; a
cave of La Madeleine,. Perigord, France,
is so lifelike that it must have, been
made bv one who was familiar with
the animal. In Wisconsin one of the
mounds of the mound builders so per
fectly represents the elephant that it
is hardly possible to doubt the famil
iarity of the builders with this animal.

â¢AN .AUSTRALIAN. NAVY.
IN a lengthy article recently published the London
GJobe takes r'eluctant cognizance of. a movement" on
â¢the part of the Labor .party .in th? Parliament of -the
Australian . Â«fÂ©mm.onwe.alth . to de'rnan.d *for Australia a
Federal navy. to' be con-fined to Australasian waters* and
absolutely independent of imperial control.' "The Labor
party" is*. not happy," sa'ys-tifie Giobe. "Tlie n.a*val' fonces
of the commomvealth have "been placed beypnd th-eir

. Desnite the 'efforts oi the L'ondpn- org'an t .to minimize
the importance'-of this rccent.agitation on the part of. the
Labor^ party # it must appear that strong significance at
taches to the.' movement. Though that- party # is yet in
the minority in the commonwealth Parliament, and \*ery
little stronger* thair Jt'he home organization eff the same
political views, this radical platform indicates , an under
current of feeling in 'Australia which is setting in against
the continuance of the colonial condition. Never before*
has a dependency of 'Great Britain voiced a, demand that
it be given independent power in the matter of armed
protection. The platform of the labor leaders is in effect
a demand for sovereignty.
According to the -Globe the radicals base their claim
upon the plea that in case England were to be involved
in a great war with a strong power, especially if the peat
of hostilities were jn the Far East, the whole of Austral
asia would be at the mercy of the first hostile fleet to
sail down there. With a sea; coast of eight thousand
miles and with their principal towns all located upon tide
water the minority leaders declare that Australia = would
fall at a single blow. They furthermore maintain that
theirs is a continent, bound to Great Britain only by a
rapidly -fading- traditionÂ»nd that it is their right that the-

It has been found that in Brazil there - # is a vast and
profitable market fo.r American flour. This fact shoufd
suggest to us a golden opportunity not lightly to be con
sidened or overlooked. In our capacity of tradesman,
\honest and fair, we may win the patronage and friend

South American Governments, and through it dominate
the others by weapons more effective than gunboats.

being pushed against him/)y the Minis

the bench for a friend ft his own. As

Tete-it- r retÂ£ ': Between 'Russian
. and * J'apanese Is
an â¢Incident of Great Interest
Â£ ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 1.â The, court
Dall* at the Winter Palacje .ttf-night was
the most brilliant event of "its klnd^he^d
here in. years^andit marked the climax
cf the social season. . â¢-:.â 
,T"ae vast labyrinth :of the famous
halls presented a remarkable scene, for
Â«very one present, from the Czar down
to the lowest civilian, was in uniform.
The'iadies were clad In magnhicent
court -costume* '"and the' dazzling .dis
play of jewels probably 'â¢.ould not be
surpassed at/any other .court of Eu
rope. The ladles of the diplomatic corps
present wore gowns â¢of great beauty.
The Czar- and Czarina a.nd the impe
rial fstfnily met the guests in the wtyte
marble salon. His Majesty, wearing
the uniform of an officer of the Impe
rial Guard, led the grand march with
Lady Seott, wife of the British Embas
sador, the Embassador escorting the
Czarina. The Dowager Empress was
not present. Mrs. McCormick, wf's o^
the American Embassador, was escort- 1
ed by Grand Duke Cyrille. The Czar
did not. dan ue the Russian, mazurka,
which is, the feature of the court ball,
but instead he. moved about and con
versed with the diplomats. While
rpeaking with Embassador McCormick
his Majesty took occasion to renew the
assurances of his warm friendship for
the United States.
During trie evening Count Lamsdorff,*
the Foreign 'Minister, drew M. Kurino,"
the Japanese Minister v"o Russia, into a
window embrasure, where the two
talked earnestly for half a:i hour. \ The
incident attracted general attention.
A grand supper, at which 3000 guests
sat down, was laid Â§ at midnight.

TEXDEU A BANQUET TO
TAX COLLECTOU SMITH
Civil Service Employe* Gather at Ta
ble and Enjoyable Affair Is
the Result.
The employes of the Tax Collector's
oSic-e tendered a banquet to Tax Col
lector Edward J. Smith and his chief
deputy, James A. Simpson, at a down
town restaurant last Saturday, even
ing. Thirty-live guests were seated at
the table. Edwin It. Zion, chairman
of the banquet committee, called the
guests to order when coffee was served
and announced .' that George Varcoe
would act as toastmaster.
The Tax Collector voiced his appre
ciation of the services rendered by the
civil service employes during the last
two years and expressed a willingness
to carry out the platform pledge of
his party with reference to the merit
system. Chief Deputy Simpson poke
on the freedom of Ireland. John A.
Lenahan paid tribute to the fotlr em
ployes of the office that have died
Â«=incft the last banquet, two years ago.
Joseph K. Jones laid emphasis on -a.
higher duty than that of simply draw
ing a salary. Popular airs played by
the orchestra developed the fact that
the office was blessed with an abun
dance of vocal talent and made th*e
evening pass quickly and pleasantly.
Before the : banquet Mr. Smith was
presented with an invitation engraved
on a silver plate. The banquet com
mittee consisted of E. EL Zion, W. T.
Howe, G. T. Poultney and R. J. Cur

HEALTH BOARD
PROBES CHARGES
Ex-Superinteiident W. J. KeJly
of the Almshouse Is Asked
to Explain Certain Shortages
Ex-Superintendent W. J. Kelly of the
Almshouse is the subject of an investi
gation by the Board of Health result
ing from charges filed by Frank A..
Schmitz, the. present superintendent.
When Schmitz tovk office.and the books
of the Almshouse were turned over
to him he claimed to have found that
certain accounts needed explanation by
Kelly. '
Schrr.itz claimed that Kelly had han
dled the pension of Mrs. Mary O'Neil,
an inmate of the Almshouse. and that
he had paid over to her the sum of
$252 when she was reaiiy entitled to
$3^4. Another complaint made by
Schmitz was that Kelly had not ac
counted, for the fund cf |250 donated
by Mrs. Phebe A. Hearst previous to
Christmas,, the donation being for the
benefit of the inmates of the Aims
house.
An expert examined the books of the
AlmRhouse and a report was filed with
the Board of Health. The result was
that a special committee was appointed
to investigate. The committee, con
sisting jof Drs. Poheim. Harvey ?nd
Hughes, met yesterday and was aided
by Deputy Health Officer Louis Levy
in probing into the charges made by
Frank A. Schmitz against Kelly.
J. \V. Cameron, ex-assifttant secre
tary of the Board of Health, appeared
for Kelly. Cameron stated that Kelly
was too ill to attend the meeting, but
was prepared to make any explanation
needed. In reply to questions, Cameron
stated that he had worked on the books
of the Almshouse for Kelly previous
to Schmitz taking office and that every
thing was supposed to be in good shape.
Cameron made no explanation of why
Kelly had made an error of $72 in pay
ing the penision cf Mrs. O'Neil, other
than it was an "error." Cameron, on
behalf %f Kelly, tendered the $72 to
th<* investigating committee, but th&
doctors refused to accept it, saying it
was not in their province to do so.
Finally Superintendent Frank A.
Schmitz accepted the rrtoney and gave
a receipt for it to Cameron and the

The statement is segregated so as
to show Â«th*e firVancial operjitlons from
January 1, 1903, to September" 14 of
the Spring VaHey Water Works and
those for the remainder of the. year,
when th-e corporate name was changed
to "the Spring Valley Wat'er Company.
The statement ajso shows the name
of eaeh water rate payer, his "place of
residence and the amount he'has.giaid
for water during the year.
Explaining a"n item of $25,000 for
discount on bonds, Ames sgid that the
sum had been written off as a loss on
new construction account because the
bonds had been sold b'elow par and
the money raised had been used to pay
a floating debt incurred Â£or new con
struction work.
FIXES .VALUE OF PLANT.
The Board of Public Works trans
mitted to the Supervisors the ap-
I praisement prepared by City Engineer
I Grunsky of the properties of the
Spring Valley Water Company actually
used in furnishing the city and its in
habitants with a pure supply of water.
Grunsky states that the appraisement
agrees in the main with those j?ub-
I mitted in preceding years," betterments
being added at about cost to the
[ original valuation. It does not in
j elude such : properties as the Portola
| reservoic* the- upper sections of the
j Locks Creek aqueduct, the Lobos
j Creek lands and the Market-street
i reservoir site, which nre not at pres
! ent in use. The recapitulation of the
I report follows:

money will be turned over to Mrs.
O'Neil. Regarding the disbursement of
the donation of Mrs. Hearst, Cameron
said that Kelly was entitled to expend
the amount as he saw fit, and that
he had given the money away to ap
plicants for charity and other worthy
causes.
The investigating doctors thought
that Kelly should furnish vouchers for
the amounts expended out of Mrs
Hearst's donation, but Cameron did not
ag?ee with them. ,
The investigation was then adjourned
in order to give Kelly an opportunity
of appearing and making a personal
explanation.

VENTURA IS GIVEN RECORD
RUSH THROUGH QUARANTINE
Federal OfScials Board the Liner a. Mile Outside -Fort
Point, Complete Inspection Before Meiggs Wharf
Is Reached and "the Mails Are Landed on Time
The Federal quarantine officials
made record â work of inspecting the
liner Ventura,, which arrived late yes
terday afternoon from the Antipodes.
The Ventura carries "the Australian-
British mails and to make trans-At
lantic conections it was necessary that
the letter bags> be landed in time to
be transferred to the overland train.
Stormy weather delayed the liner and
instead of getting into- port early in
the day. as she usually does, it was 3
o'clock when the weather bureau fur
nished -the information that she was
passing the Farallones. ' Dr. Cum
mings, surgeon in charge of the quar
antine station, was aware of the com
mercial importance of the early land
ing of the Ventura's mails.' He knew
the steamer was coming and realized
that detention in quarantine might
mean several days' delay in the deliv
ery of the mail or involve the expense
a"nd inconvenience of chartering a
special train. Dr. Cummings* regime
at Angel Island has been distinguished
for the gracious consideration with
which the stern requirements of the
quarantine laws have been adminis
tered and yesterday at some inconven
ience to the surgeon and his assistants
the element of delay in the Ventura's
case was eliminated.
As soon as the liner wag within
sight of Point Lobos the quarantine
steamer General Sternbergr was head
ed for the Golden Gate and a mile be
yond Fort Point Dr. Cummings and
his assistants boarded the Ventura. The
inspection occupied just half an hour.
Purser E. H. Bucknam having every
thing ready for the doctors, and the
yellow flag was hauled down before
Meiggs wharf was reached. Custom
house officials boarded the liner on
the fly and within a few minutes the
Ventura was moored at the end â¢ of
Broadway wharf discharging the Brit
ish mails into waiting trucks.
The liner later was warped across
to her berth at Pacific-street wharf,
where the passengers went ashore.'
Captain Hayward reports having
encountered dirty weather between
Sydney and Honolulu and during
three days of the run from Honolulu
the Ventura fought her way through
a rough sea stirred up by northeast
and easterly grales.
The Ventura brought 175 passen
gers and 926 tons of cargo. She was
twenty days twenty-three hous from
Sydney and five days twenty hours
fifty-eight minutes from Honolulu.
Ensign C. C. Bloch of the navy was
a passenger on the liner from Pago
Pago, where he has been acting col
lector of the port. Warrant Machin
ist Frederick Ruth, who has been
chief engineer of the gunboat Wheel
ing, also came from the Samoan port.
Captain F. S. H. Baldrey of the Brit
ish army was a passenger from Auck
land. Another Samoan passenger was
Baron Seldenack, a globe-trotting
German.
The Ventura's passengers included
thÂ» following:

Boy From a Place of Peril
ACCIDENT AT 'WOOD CHUTE
Injured Lad Waits an Hour
on a â¢ Narrow m Ledge While
Hfs Rescuers Are at Work
Special Dirpatch to The Call.
TACOMA. Wash.. Feb. 1.â It required
several citizens of Skagway and a de
tachment of troops to rescue 8-year-old
Grant Carlson from a dangerous posi
tion on a mountain ledge, where the
boy had hung at the end of a thrilling
slide .down the mountain side above
Skagway.
With his playmates the Carlson boy
cllm>ed far up the mountain and en
deavored to cross the Dillon wood
chute, down which many cords of wood
are dumped daily to the power-house
below. The chute Is worn to extreme
smoothness and was coated with ice.
The boy fell into the chute and shot
down it with lightning rapidity. Then
he fell fifty feet to a dent worn In the
mountain wall by descending wood.
With his leg broken at .the thigh the
boy remained in this perilous position
for over an hour. His cries attracted
the attention of Frank Young, who,
with John Carlson, the boy's father,
and others hurried to' the rescue. A
rope .was let clown the mountain side
and Young descended to- the ledge.
Carlson then Joined him: In the mean
time woodchoppers far up the moun
tain were throwing wood into the
chute, iri this manner-injuring Carlson.
At great risk Carlson and Young crept
along the narrow dent, moving the boy
to a safer ledge. Exhausted by their
efforts and trembling: with nervousness,
they lacked strength to mount, the
rope. Lieutenant WiddieHeld and a de
tachment of soldiers went to the scene.
Private Payne was let down on\a rope
and then hauled up with the boy in his
arms.. Carlson and Young were after
ward rescued in> the same way.

Special Dispatch to The Call
SAN BERNARDINO. Feb. 1.â Three
young girls of this city have beer set
down as heroines because of a. brave
deed performed by them olaat evening
In saving the life of a drunken man,
who. had It not been for their efforts,
would have been mangled and prob
ably killed by a trolley car. Myrtle
Richardson, Lotta Beam and Eveiln
Beam are the names of the rescuers,
and John Edwards is the man who
owes his life to them.
The three were at Urbita Springs,
two miles south of this city. Sunday
afternoon and after dusk left the re
sort to ride home on their bicycles.
When about 200 yards north of thÂ«
springs they saw a dark object lying
across the rails of the San Bernardino
traction line and they hurried to the
spot, believing: that some one had
chained a logr to/the track. They dis
covered a man. He was a. large fellow,
weighing nearly 200 pounds. Down the
line they saw the headlight of a trac
tion car. \7
"Quick, girls!" cried Lotta Beam, as
she caught him by the shoulders. "We
must work fast or he will be killed."
The other girls tugged "with a will,
but the man could not be moved. Then
one of the girls ran along the track,
waving her hat and shouting. Her
shouts attracted ex-County Treasurer
Boren and William Rollin, who were
passing. They ran to the spot and it
took but one quick pull to drag tha
man from danger. A moment later the
car passed.
Writes of Intended Suicide.
A letter was* received at the Emer
gency Hospital yesterday afternoon
from some insane person, evidently
a woman, threatening" to commit sui
cide. The letter is crudely written
and the signature- is a skull.

CHICAGO. Feb. 1.â Before the openiri.-; hope
for Improvement In "* heat - values was sub
merged by a deluge of news, of a bearish char
acter. Foreign grain . markets were lower,
world's ehlpments for the week extremely
liberal and the quantity afloat for Europe and
Great Britain heavily Increased. With â  such
bearish information, opening prices were
lower. May being off Uc to We at SO%c to
SOc. Commission houses and pit traders were
liberal sellers, and with little support the
price declined still, further. When May had
reached 88*Â»Â«c tbe market became steadier on
a fair demand, which was supposed to be
from the leading long. The market was firmer
the last hair hour, but "showed no tendency Â»to
advance. May closed %c higher at OOfic.
After ranging between 81"i4c and 82**c. July
closed at 82%Â«S2%c. a gain of Â»_Â®"*e.
A strong feeling pervaded the corn pit, more
from a lack of offerings than -from any prom
inent buying. May closed at 5O*4c :
There was a large trade In oats, and prices
were on a higher levet. May closed at 44%c.
There was a fair demand for lard and rib*
later, and In consequence part of the early
loss was regained. The Hose was steady, with
May pork 2>/4c lower, .May ribs down 5c and
May lard 2V_c lower.

but an .unsatisfactory " demand for Floor Is
probably at the root of It. A' rather strong

Late New; York mall advices say regarding
the movement of the Santa Clara ValUy Prune
growers to obtain better prices for their fruit:
"In the trade here the movement does not Â«eem
to attract much attention, and the opinion ex
pressed In some quarters is not favorable to
the*, successful consummation of the plans of
the co-operative and grower packers who con
trol the stock of Santa Clara Prunes pn the
coast. The fact that tlncc the date nf the
meeting at which the plans were formulated
Santa Clara stock has bÂ«en freely offered from
the coast on a 2Hc basis Is taken as an Indi
cation that some at'lea'tt of the holders have
not much confidence In the efficacy of... the plan

who was arrested here after the rob
bery, but as no evidence could be ob
tained against him he was convicted of
vagrancy. /
About a week after the robbery De
tective O'Dea. who was accompanied
by Evans, located Sterling in a house
at Fourth and Folsom streets. They
found him in a hallway and O'Dea,
presenting a revolver at his head, or
dered him to throw up his hands.
While O'Dea was pulling out his hand
cuffs Sterling grabbed a revolver from
Evans and. pointing It at O'Dea,
tried to kill him, but the weapon
enapped three times without going off.
O'Dea struck him on the head with his
handcuffs, knocking him down stairs.
Sterling sprang to his feet and made
his escape. . â¢â¢
Descriptions and photographs â¢ of
Sterling were sent throughout the State
fend O'Dea, learning that Sterling had
been seen in the neighborhood of San
Bernardino, notified Sheriff Ralphs,
who arrested Sterling last Thursday.
WhÂ«Â»n Sterling was taken out of his
cell on Sunday afternoon to be brought
to this city he showed fight. He is a
powerful young fellow and it took the
combined efforts of the Sheriff and sev
rral deputies to get the handcuffs over
his wrists, which are abnormally large.
The police say that besides the charge
of robbery against him there may be
two charges of assault to murder. He
is an ex-convict, having served a term
in Folsom penitentiary for robbery un
der th name of Joseph O'Brien.

EWING'S SCHEME
BEFORE A JURY
3Ianager of the. Standard Oil
Promotion arid Investment
Company. Placed on Trial
VICTIMS POOR PEOPLE
Promised .Big Dividends That
Xever Arrived and Their
Principal Also Melted Away
William BvEwing, secretary-treas
urer and general promoter 'of the de
funct Standard Oil Promotion land In
vestment Company,; .wa.s placed, on
trial yesterday before a jury atid
United States District Judge de Haven
en Â«n" indictment charging him with
having used the mails for the p.urpqse
of defrauding. Several victims of the
scheme testified yesterday and the trial
will! be resumed this morning.
Ewing organized : the â¢ "company"
and incorporated it on December 31,
l!>01. On the anniversary ..of .national
independence, July 4, 1901,. Ewirig left
this city 'and hid himself in "Chicago,
but John H. Bricker, a relentless post
office inspector, tracked him to his lair
and haled him before the. outraged
r.iajosty of .the" law.
The bait offered to the victims was
a neatly printed and elegantly worded
prospectus announcing that the ob
ject of the company y:as to organize oil
companies and finance them with all
the way from J100.Q00 to. $5,000,000
capitalization. The company professed
to transact a co-operate investment
business and to give to the investor of
limited means "the same opportunities
enjoved by kings of finance and mar
ket leaders." After thirty, days each
investor was to receive pro rata shares
of the profits for that' month in checks
guaranteed* to be as good'. as United
States gold bonds. â¢ The prospectus
averred that the company was repre
sented in every- oil producing district
in Oalfornia and Texas. In order" .'to
show the good faith of the. company
each- investor, after havi.ng had his
money in possession .of th.e company
for ninety days, was at liberty to with
draw in cash the whole of his' invest
ment, together with 'his share of th,e
earned profits,' upon giving thirty days.*
notice in. writing.
A. M. Aubertus was appointed agent
of the company at Sacramento, ' and,
believing: in the representations * of
George B. Chaney, the vice president
of the corporation,' he induced, several
of his friends to invest â¢ Among the
deluded ones was Mrs. Mary.Hansen
of Broderick,- Yolo Coqnty. She tes
tified yesterday that she put in $500
and drew out $64 in" divlden'ds. She
was satsiHed with the dividends as
such, but she. failed' to recover a dollar
of the principal. Mrs. Annie Guth^ie
of Sacramento put in $400 Â«ind lost it
all.' . Charles. F. Dosch of- the'sam.e
place bade fareweil to 5500 and' Fred
Almond contributed 530tt. to th'e
credulity fund. ' All tested before the
Grand Jury that they had been in
duced to inveSt their money upon the
representations made .in prospectuses"
and letters sent them, througji tti"Â«
mails by lowing.
MANY MILLIONS
ARE AT STAKE
Unless Cattle Quarantine Is
Kelased by Government Great
Herds in South Must Perish
Leading cattlemen fn this .cjty say"
that unless the Government can be in- :
duced to temporarily relax Its quaran
tine regulations -against the transporta
tion of cattle out of the" south'em coun
ties of. the State, where prolonged
drouth has made feed very scarce, the
los by death" of cattle w(H run jnto mill
ions of dollars. There -is srajs for "the
cattle to eat If they can be moved to it.
Fortunes depend on one or- two .con
tingenciesâthat rain shall speedily, fall
in the south and' that it be a. warm
rain that will not chill and' kill thou
sands of cattle that are debilitated* and
unable longer to endure extremes; or
that the National Government and the.
county governments of California that
have quarantine ordinances 'shall yield
to the present pressing emergency.
At one time the quarantine lines of
the National Government took in all
California. Gradually, as the Texas
fever has been stamped out, the limit
of quarantine has been moved south
ward and now the northern counties,
generally are exempt from quarantine.
In the north the greater share of the
rain of this exceptionally dry winter
has fallen. In the south, where- the
quarantine is still effective, there . is
great need for some remedial measure.
The quarantine Is rigorous in the
counties of San Luis Obispo, Santa
Barbara, Ventura, San Bernardino,
Orange, Riverside and San Diego. In
the counties of Merced, Madera, Fresno.
Tulare and Monterey cattle are freely
moved after special inspection, which
is a relaxation of the former regula
tions. Like indulgence in the face of
imminent heavy . losses is sought for
the other counties mentioned.
Governor Pardee and the State Veter
inarian are trying to have some meas
ure of relief adopted. The situation is
critical. Millions of San Francisco capÂ«
ltal depend on the outcome of jthe next
fortnight. Miller & Lux and John C.
Klrkpatrlck, manager of the Palace
Hotel, have reports and say the emer
gency is prepsing.

If jour hair is brittle Â»nd thinning, you

beiaure dandruff is nothing but scales of scalp
being: thrown up by a pestiferous little germ
in burrowing its way to the root of the hair,
where it saps the vitality, causing- falling hair
and. In time, baldness. Sow, you can't stop
dandruff nor falling hair, nor- prevent bald-

only preparation that can do It is the new
scientific discovery, Newbro's Herpicide. in 1
fact, no other hair preparation claims to kill

hearers' that men of i*eljgion'must'be
as industrious in the church as those
in business, and he said there was no
more significant word in the English

showed in illustration of his meaning
how a man.can be entirely .won from
