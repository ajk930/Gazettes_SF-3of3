BELIEVE THEY
HAVE ROBBERS
Officers Arrest Three 3Ien
for Alleged Complicity in
the Express Car Tragedy
Special DUratch to Th- Call
LOS ANGELES. Dec. T.-It is now
believed that three men were impli
cated in the robbery of the Wells-Far
go express <-ar on the Santa Fe over
land train Monday, during which Ex
press Messenger Roberts was fatally
shot, and the San Bernardino officers
and railroad detectives believe they
have all three of the men in custody.
The prisoners are N. R. Fitzpatrick, a
former railroad fireman and miner;
Charles Weis. a hobo, and Garfield
Williams, a negro hostler. They are
known to have been in the vicinity of
the scene of the robbery at the time
it was committed. ( Fitzpatrick was
captured at Ludlow by Sheriff Ralphs
of San Bernardino County and a posse
of Santa Fe detectives. The Sheriff
Fays that he believes the prisoner is
the man who flred the shot which
killed Roberts.
Fitzpatrick was seen to leave Rob
erts' train at Daggett before the rob
bery was discovered. He was traced
to Borate. on the Salt Lake road, and
from there to Ludlow, where he was
taken into custody as h*> was trying to
read the dispatches the operator had
received for the Sheriff.
Fitzpatrick admits he was in Dag
gett when Roberts' train arrived, but
says he was a mile west of the depot
at the time, which is positively dis
proven by Section Foreman John Mar
tin of the Salt Lake Railroad, who rec
ognized him as he leaped from the
Overland.
It is believed the money taken from
the Wells-Fargo safe is burled between
Daggett and Borate. When Kitzpat
rick alighted from Roberts' train he
â wore a cap. which he later discarded
for a slouch hat.
Charles Weis. the hobo, was arrested
by Railroad Detective Mulvane and
when put through the sweating pro
cess made such admissions that It was
decided to hold him. Weis admitted
that hÂ« was riding on the front end of
the express car out of Needles. He says
when thÂ« train reached Lavlck, Mes
senger Roberts opened the door and
ordered him to get off the car and th*n
looked to see if there "were other hobos
on the front end. He declares that Jf
others were on the train he did not
know it. This Is not believed and the
officers expect to establish it as a fact
that Weis either had something to do
with the robbery and murder or knows
who committed the crime.
Fitzpatrick was seen with a negro
the day before the robbery. The negro
Is believed to be Williams, who was
brought to Los Angeles, but arrived
too late to be identified by the dying
messenger. Williams has been taken
to Daggett to see if he can be Identi
fied as the man who was with Fitz
patrick. If he Js 60 Identified, it will
be a strong link in the chain \ of cir
cumstantial evidence against him.
The search for the money will be
continued daily by the officers. Until
it is found there can be no positive evi
dence against any of the suspects, all
of whom will be held until every clew
in connection with the case has been
run down.

The burglaries extended over a period
of several months, during which a

all been committed by C. H. Schmidt,
a well-known and prosperous con
tractor and builder, assisted bv his
two sons. Roy, aged 19, and Ray, aged
13. Practically all the plunder stolen
by the trio has been recovered. It
had been boxed and crated and. it
completely filled four rooms In the
fine residence which Schmidt owns. â¢-â "-

four months a number of men have
been systematically robbing the Con

of its richest, ore and have been ship

mated that more than $10,000 worth of
the richest ore in the mine was stolen
and turned into gold at Selby's.
The theft was discovered by an em
ploye of | Selby's. who recognized the
last consignment'of ore as coming from .
the . Consolidated Virginia mine when j
it was supposed to. have come from an
other mine in Nevada. He immediately
reported the matter to Superintendent

LAUGHS AT DUPES
NEW YORK. Dec. 7.â Mrs. Chad
wick's arrest has nothing to do -with
the forgery charge made by President
Beckwlth of the Oberlin Bank, which
was forced to close Its doors. Should
the forgery charge be pressed the
State authorities would act. not the
national Government. In that event
it- would be necessary to swear out a
warrant In Ohio and ask for her ex
tradition to the Buckeye State.
But it Is not likely that a forgery
charge will be made. Andrew Carnegie
declares that he has not the slightest
intention of proceeding against the
woman. If he should not do so It will
be hard to indict her, even If the notes
are forged, as President Beckwlth
says.
The State of Ohio cannot force Car
negie's attendance upon the Grand
Jury unless ho crosses the line into
that State. Should he repudiate the
nntes suit cnuld be htpus-ht aerainst
him by a citizen of Ohio In the United
States court and the testimony- he
gave might be used before the Grand
Jnry.
When Carnegie was ask-d to-day if
he intended to prosecute Mrs. Chad
wick. he said: "Why no. I've, no inten
tion of doing any such thing. Why
should I?" .
"If your name has been forged, don't
you feel it Incumbent upon you to find
out who is guilty and punish that per
son V "â ",-
"Not at all," exclaimed Carnegie.
"Would you not feel glad to know that
some one has been able to get J2.000.000
by simply signing your name to a
piece of paper. It shows that my
credit Is AL"
Carnegie chuckled.
MRS. CHADWICK'S ARREST.
Mrs. Cassie L. Chadwick was placed
under arrest to-night In her apart
ments In the Hotel Breslin. charged
with aiding and abetting a bank of
ficer in embezzling (12,500. The ar

you of annoyance, however."
COACHED BY' ATTORNEY.
When the conference was in progress
a man believed to be Powers, one of
Mrs. Chadwick's counsel, entered the
room and began to advise her. He told
her to stay in bed and under no circum
stances to leave the room. Marshal
Henkel took exception to the advice
and said:
"If Mrs. Chadwick needs my advice
as a prisoner I'll give it to her. No at
tempt will be made to move her away
from her room to-night, but she must
go before Commissioner Shields in the
morning.'*
The secret service men engaged a
room adjoining Mrs. Chadwick's suite
and established themselves there for
the night, while' one of ', the Marshal's
men was posted in Mrs. -Chadwick's
bedroom, one outside her door apd an
other In the corridor.
Marshal Henkel said he would re
main in direct supervision of things all
night. - -
George Ryall. a lawyer representing
Newton of Brookllne. one of Mrs. Chad
wick's creditors, called to see her soon
after her arrest. He whispered with
her tor a moment and then left the
room.
Soon after the arrest and before it
was known whether Mrs. Chadwick
would be taken from the hotel at once
or not the hotel management sent to
Mrs. Chadwick a bill for the rooms up
to to-day. She paid it and the bill was
returned to her receipted. By. permis

to come to her at once. He arrived a
few moments later. The physician said
that although he had advised her sev
eral days ago to go to a sanitarium,
she would be able to appear to-morrow
before the United States Commissioner.
B. J. Whitney, who is a director of
the Citizens' National Bank of Oberlin.

oner, but permission was denied him.
CARNEGIE'S NAME MENTIONED.
Andrew Squire, who came here yes
terday from Cleveland with Iri Rey
nolds, secretary of the Wade Park
Banking Company, had a half-hour's
conversation with Mrs. Chadwick. At
the conclusion of the conference Squire
paid:
"The arrest of Mrs. Chadwick doe*
not in any way affect the holding we
have of her securities and it does not
change the legal proceedings necessary
in -the further evolution of the case."
Squire further said that he did not
know the present whereabouts of Rey
nolds, who is said to have in his pos
session the $3.o00.00i> in securities be
lonsrin? to Mrs. Chadwick.
The deputy marshals and secret ser
vii-e men who v. ere in Mrs. Chadwick's
r<>om said that the name of Andrew
Carnegie was mentioned several times
and that the s-iund'of the name each
time caused Mrs. Chadwick to smile.

; \VO3IAN'S DUAL ROLE.
"I am not sure as to the witnesses
I will summon in the case. I can name
only one of thorn at present. This per
son /will be Irving Belford, now clerk
of the United States Court for t"hÂ»Â»
Northern District of Ohio. Belford de
fended Josiph' 'Lariib, "who'was arrest
ed with Mme. Devere . for forging
$JO,000 worth of notes.: Lamb being ac
quitted on the ground that . he was
held in the woman's power and did not
knowinply commit a crime. Belford
will be asked to identify Mrs. .Chad
wick as Mme. Devere. which, he.de
t-Jares, he can do. As to .the rest, of
the case which we have prepared I
cannot talk at presents The notes
signed with the' name of Andrew Car
negie will enter into it, 1 suppose; A3
to whether forgery can be proved I
6m not now prepared to state."
Regarding the arrest of Mrs. Chad
wick by the Federal offlcfals,- the " re
ceiver of the Chadwick property, Na
than Loeser, said that it need not
necessarily interfere with the bank
ruptcy petition; that she can be pro
ceeded against in bankruptcy and her
assets distributed among her credi
tors.
In order to make as strong a case as
possible against Mrs. Chadwick the
Federal officials will subpena. as soon
as service is possible, a number of wit
nesses who have known Mrs. Chadwick
for twenty years. The witnesses will
attempt to prove that Mrs. Chadwick
and Madame Devere*are the. same per
son. ,
BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS.
Application was made to-day in the
United States District Court for the
summoning of Cassie L. Chadwick, Iri
Reynolds and Emil Hoover, the son of
Mrs. Chadwick, for purposes of exam
ination in bankruptcy proceedings.- The
petition was filed by Nathan Loeser,
receiver for the Chadwick estate.
The petition reiterates that, although
reasonable effort has been made, the
receiver has thus far been unable I to
secure possession of the property lof
Mrs. Chadwick.
The petitioner recites that he is in
formed that the persons named in the
petition have in their possession se
curities, jewelry and other property of
great value belonging to Mrs. Cha'd
wick and which should be in the hands
of the petitioner.
Prosecutor Keeler'of this county and
Prosecutor Stroup of Loraine County
had a conference to-day regarding ac
tion taken in regard to the forged notes
which were held by Mrs. Cassie L.
Chadwick and which were the cause of
the wrtcking of the Oberlin Citizens'
National Bank. The conference related
particularly to the matter of jurisdic
tion and it was decided to take up the
case in Loraine County.
President Beckwith and Cashier
Spear have been subpenaed to ap
pear before the special Grand Jury
which will meet to-morrow at JElyria.
Both prosecutors say they are de
termined to vigorously prosecute any
infraction of the State laws in the
Chadwick case. t :.\ â¢: ':â  â â â 'â .
TWO ANDREW CARNEGIES.
PITTSBURG, Dec. 7.-3n Pittsburg
there is not a man of business who
really believes that Andrew Carnegie,
ironmaster and philanthropist, is guil
ty of complicity in the Chadwick case.
But there are two Andrew Carnegies.
This fact has recently come to the
minds of Pittsburgers.
"Two Andrew Carnegies," hundreds
of sensible men of this city of million
aires have said to-day; "funny we
never thought of that before."
The second Andrew Carnegie is a"
son of Mrs. Lucy Carnegie, who is a
widow of the elder Andrew's brother,
Tom Carnegie. Andrew the second is
not well known. In fact he was en
tirely forgotten until the Chadwick
case came out in all its glare. It is
not said that the second Andrew Car
negie has had anyhing to do with the
case, but it is pointed out -that there
are two Andrew Carnegies, and there
fore the case becomes more than ever
complicated.
BOSTON. Dec. 7.â The Globe says
Mrs. Chadwick, before receiving the
loan from Herbert D. Newton of Brook
line, saw a Boston attorney, gave him
a $500 note purporting to have been
signed by Andrew Carnegie and a cer
tificate that $5,000,000 In securities were
on deposit with the Wade Park Bank
ing Company of Cleveland, Ohio, and
as.ked him to raise a loan for her.
With the-story of valuable property
held In trust the attorney applied to
Jthn M. Graham, president of the In
ternational Trust Company, for a loan
of $200,000. Graham saw the note and
certificate, but, as he says, "there was
altogether too much mystery about It.
I said at once that I could not make
a loan on that basis. Three minutes
was all the time I gave to hearing the
story and deciding not to make the
loan."

CONGRESS ASKED TO CUT DOWN

PLATT TAKES

Introduces His Bill That
Lessens Representation by
Nineteen Votes in All
STATEMENT WITH IT
Senator Believes Treatment
of Negroes Entitled to
Ballot Warrants Action
i .WASHINGTON. Dec. 7,^-Senator
Platt of New York to-day introduced
his bill, prepared under the direction of
the committee on national affairs of the
Republican Club of the city of New
York, having as its purpose the reduc
tion ot representation in Congress of
the. Southern States that have-dis
franchised the negroes. The bill if en
acted in its present form would lessen
the membership in Congress by nine
teen, according- to the estimate that
has been made by the Republican Club,
which originated it. The bill and an
explanatory statement issued by Sen
ator Platt were referred to thi Com
mittee on Census.
The bill provides for the redu-Jtion of
representation in the House of P.epre
sentatives as follows: Alabama, from
i) to 7; Arkansas, from 7 to 6: Florida,
3 to 2; Georgia, 11 to 8; Lyuisiana, 7 to
5, Mississippi, 8 to 6; North Carolina,
10 to 8; South Carolina, 7 to 5; Tennes
see, 10 to 9; Texas, 16 to 15; Vorginia,
10 to 8. â¢ â â 
The statement says
â¢ This bill is framed upon the lowest limita
tion ;>ossible treats as excluded from the
suffra-.e only the male negro citizens over '21
years of age, classed by the twelfth census
as illiterate under the 1!HX> census tables, pub
lished since the apportionment act of January
16. 1901.
The aggregate* actually excluded from the
suffrage In each of the States mentioned are
in truth larger than thos<> used as the basis
for thin act. If all ne?ro votables U- e.,
male citizens over I'D regardless of Illiteracy
should be deemed to be excluded, the reduction
in reprepentatlqn, figured from the same
tables, would he nearly twice as great as
stated in this bill. 9
It requires no evidence beyond the notorious
historical fact for Congress to adjudge what
cannot be denied, that the class of negro Illit
erates, to the extent stated, is practically ex
cluded from the suffrage In the States men
tioned in the bill, no matter what may f t>e the
nominal provisions of their respective consti
tution or election laws. The bill therefore
presents the smallest reduction practicable and
is very conservative.
The "apportionment" remains as fixed in
11*01. and the "reduction" Is to cease when ths
facts >hall warrant It. â¢
The bill has been prepared under the direc
tion of the committee on national affairs of
the Republican Club of the city of New York,
the club havlnr at Its first meeting after the
Presidential election unanimously voted to re
quest Congress to take Immediate action, pur
suant to the representation plank in the na
tional Republican platform.

Though an uncle of Bertha Dolbeer,
Adolph Sehander did not even have a
speaking acquaintance with her. His
own statements under oath to this ef
fect were read to the jury yesterday.
His claim to a third of her estate is
based on his tie of consanguinity, yet
he gave testimony that afte^-she. was 3

hearing in the contest.
F. A. Parker, vault, clerk, testified
that April 25, 1904, was the date of the
last visit of Bertha Dolbeer to her
safety deposit box, where her will was
found. It was undoubtedly on that day
that. she deposited the testament there.
Mrs. Lena R. Thompson" of Chicago,
who came to testify in response to a
request from the proponents, said she
became acquainted with " the testatrix
five years ago. Two years later the
witness saw Miss Dolbeer and Miss
Warren for four hours in Chicago while
they were on their way home from the
East.
Last April Miss Dolbeer telegraphed
from San Francisco before starting on
her last 1 trirÂ» to Europe what day she
would" lie. "In" Chicago, and asked Mrs.
Thompson to take luncheon with her
and Miss Warren. The witness de
scribed ,the luncheon, which was fol
lowed by a matinee theater party. The
testatrix .was In cheerful spirit and
spoke enthusiastically in anticipation
of the enjoyment she, expected to find
in her stay -in Europe. .,
"In my oplnlonMlss.Dolbeer was per

EARLY DEBATE
IN THE SENATE
Bill Providing: Pensions for
Telegraph Operators of
Civil War Starts Oratory
BUSY SESSION HELD
Vote Will Be Taken on the
Philippine Measure on the
Sixteenth of This Month
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.â The Sen
ate, to-day reached a decision -to vote
on : the Â« Philippine Civil Government
bill, providing for the construction of
railroads in the islands, on the 16th
of this month, and in addition trans
acted considerable other business.
Platt of New York created something
of a st/r by introducing a bill provid
ing for a. reduction of the Congres
sional representation of the Southern
States on the ground that many of the
citizens of these States are deprived of
their right to vote. Scott plunged the
Senate into an exceptionally early de
bite by attempting to secure the
passage of a bill granting pensions to
telegraph operators of the Civil War.
A large number of bills and joint
resolutions were introduced and many
petitions were presented. The discus
sion of the time for voting on the
Philippine bill brought out the* fact
that there is a general understanding
that the Christmas holiday recess will
begin on the 19th inst. â¢
In. executive session the Senate con
firmed all four. Cabinet nominations
and those of Postmaster Willcox at
New y; O rk and Indian Commissioner
Leupp.
When Scott asked the Senate to en
ter upon the consideration of the bill
placing on the pension rolls the tele
graph operators who served as such
during the Civil War Cockrell called
attention to the fact that soldiers were
paid $13 per month, while telegraph
operators had received from $60 to $10Â«)
per month, and on this account he op
posed the bill. He also said that if
telegraph operators were t3 be pen
sioned it would be necessary to pen
sion teamsters and other civil * em
ployes.
McCumber spoke in support of the
bill, saying there would be only 1ST
beneficiaries under the bill; but be
fore he had concluded the Senate ad
journed.

Interior Department States
That Work of Prosecution
Will Go on to the End
ALL TO SUFFER AMKE
Guilty Persons, High or Low,
Will -Be Hunted Down by
the Government Officials
WASHINGTON. Dec 7.â An official
statement was given out by the Inte
rior Department to-day announcing the
Government's purpose to prosecute
every man Involved in the -public-land
frauds to the full extent of the law, re
gardless of his position ;ln life. The
statement follws:
The conviction In Portland yesterday of flvÂ«
persona for land frauds, which- will be fol
lowed next week by the trial of several others
indicted for the game offense, is but another
step toward the consummation of the policy
entered upon by the Secretary of the Inte
rior when it became known nearly three year*
ago that frauds were . ttelng perpetrated
In connection with the public lands, to run
down and prosecute the guilty cnes to the
full extent of the law. without regard to their
position In life.
The department has encountered many ob
stacles while engaged In this work, but has
moved steadily onward and has had thÂ«
hearty assistance and co-operation of ths
Department of Justice In bringing the land
criminals' to justice. '
These frauds have been more far-reachlns
than the country has suspected, and the taak
of unearthing them and securing the necessary
proofs has been a difficult one. but there has
been no abatement Of the Intention to over
come all difficulties and secure the conviction
of the land thieve*. No one will be shielded,
whether high or low, and the work of pros
ecution will be vigorously carried on.
PORTLAND, Dec. 7.â Some of the
prisoners convicted yesterday In the
land frauds. cause are experiencing con
siderable trouble In obtaining the ad
ditional bonds placed upon them when
the conviction occurred. S. A. D. Puter
after a day's search pleaded for and
was granted until to-morrow by the
United States Marshal. He will be al
lowed to spend to-night, as he did last
night, in his room at .the hotel under
the surveillance of a deputy. Mrs. Wat
son was unable to secure bondsmen,
but her bail was reduced to $1000 cash.
She deposited the amount and was lib
erated.
Horace McKinley had no difficulty in
securing sufficient security and was lib
erated soon after the conviction oc
curred. Tarpley and Wolgamot figure
only in this one case, and therefore
their bonds were not increased.
Messasrc Referred to Committees.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7. â The
House to-day went into committee to
refer certain portions of the Presi
dent's message to the respective com
mittees having Jurisdiction over the
several, .subjects. ... As soon as this was
done the House adjourned. -.'â¢-. â  . â

Few People Know How Useful It Is tn
Preserving Health and Beauty.
Nearly everybody knows that char-
coal Is the safest and most efficient
disinfectant and purifier In nature,
but few realize its value when taken
Into the human system for the sams
cleansing purpose.
Charcoal is a remedy that the merÂ«
you take of it the better; it is net M
drug at all, but simply absorbs ths
gases and Impurities always present
in the stomach and intestines and car-
ries them ont of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after
smoking, drinking or after eating on-
ions and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and invÂ»
proves the complexion; It whitens thÂ«
teeth and further acts as a natural
and eminently safe cathartic.
It absorbs the injurious gases whlchi
collect in the stomach and bowels; It
disinfects the mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh. >
All druggists sell charcoal in enÂ«
form or another, but probably the
best charcoal and the most for ths
I money Is in Stuart's Charcoal Lozen-
j ges; they are composed of the finest
I powdered Willow charcoal and other
! harmless antiseptics In tablet form.*
â¢ or rather in the form of large, pleas-
' ant tasting lozenges, the charcoal be-
j ing mixed with honey.
The dally use of these lozenges will
soon tell in a much Improved condi-
tion of the general health, better com-
plexion, sweeter breath and purer
j blood, and the beauty of it is that no
> possible harm can result from their
' continued use, but, on the contrary,
; great benefit. â¢â ->,- : "
| A Buffalo physician, in speaking of
the benefits of charcoal, says: "I advise
Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges to all pa-
: tlents suffering from gas In stomach
. and bowels and to clear the complex-
; ion and purify the breath, mouth and
throat; I also believe the liver Is
t greatly benefited by the daily use of
â¢ them; they cost but 25 cents a box at
; drug stores and although In some
: sense a patent preparation, yet I be-

AMUCK IN WALL STREET.
Prices Suffer Through Assault
on Amalgamated Copper.
ECCEXTRIC BOSTON- FTXANCIER WHO IS DILIGENTLY ENGAGED IX AN
EFFORT TO STAMPEDE THE "BULLS- OF WALL STREET BY UNLOAD
ING AMALGAMATED COPPER SHARES.
BOSTON, Mass, Dec. 7. â Thomas W. Lawson Is reported to have an
nounced to-nUrht that he would apply for a receiver for the Amalga
mated Copper Company and substantiate every statement he had pub-
IL-hed in regard to the sreat Rockefeller trust.
NEW YORK. Dec. 7.â It was felt
after the clo.Â«e of to-day's sensational
break in the stock market, in which the
dealings attained enormous propor
tions, that a combination of circum
stances was responsible for the whole
sale and violent liquidation. Chief
atnoDg -these - influences^ every one
agreed, were the fears engendered by
the President's message as to his em
phatic attitude on Government super
vision of railroad rates and their en
forcement. Then the financial commu
nity realized that the stock market
after its Dro longed advance was in a
position described as technically weak
and topheavy, with an accumulation of
margined accounts, the stocks of which
had been acquired at practically top
prices.
Added to these influences were the
fulminations of Thomas W. Lawson,
the Boston speculator, announcing that
financial disaster was about to occur
and that the bottom was about to drop
out of the market. Circulated and pub
lished broadcast throughout the coun
try, these rumors had a most important
influence La shaping the market de
cline.
The break of security prices was
very general and liquidation continued
â¢ulmost without cessation until thcelose
cf the market. Prices declined on an
average from two to eight points, the
most prominent issue being Amalga
mated Copper, which broke in a sensa
tional manner, closing at GSVi. a loss
of about fourteen points for the pres
ent week and a decline of 8?i points
for the day. The volume of business
was unparalleled this year, and the to
tal transactions cf the day were the
largest since the memorable Northern
Pacific panic on May 9, 1S0L Altogether
about 2.500,000 shares changed hands
en the declining scale of prices.
LAWSON UNDER SUSPICION.
There were many who held to the be
lief that Lawson had been employed by
en important group of speculators to
etart the ball rolling and that he had
selected Amalgamated Copper as the
most easv vehicle with which to ac
complish the end. Early In the day
dispatches came from Boston, signed
"LawBon," to banking houses and Indi
viduals telling that President Roosevelt
â was about to "run wild," and that he,
not "Wall 6treet, controlled the railroad
cituatlon.
Advices from Washington tell of in
tense interest prevailing there over the
President's recommendations.
"The recommendations are appro
priate and the powers of the Interstate
Commerce Commission should be en
larged." said Senator Quarles.
Railway officials everywhere are
deeply concerned in the great question.
It is the general belief that the Presi
dent's recommendations are the direct
result of appeals made to him by Gov
ernors Cummins of Iowa. Van Sant of
Minnesota and La Follette of Wiscon
ein. Such appeals for rate regulation
coxne from a powerful body of men,
whose views and those of their constit
uents are entitled to consideration.
As to the future of the stock mar
ket, all depends upon the common
sense of the public. Prices have de
clined, but real values have not been
injured by incendiary circulars issued
In the stock jobbing campaign.
Neither are they injured by the dis
cussion as to the Government rate
regulation of interstate railways,
which -may never materialize. Pros
perity is genera! and is not dependent
upon any convulsion in speculative
prices.
GATES AIDING JjAWSOX.
BOSTON. Dec. 7. â It is understood
h"re that John W. Gates, the spectac
ular steel operator, is backing the
equally spectacular Thomas W. Law
son in the latter's campaign against
Amalgamated and the steel issues.
La-wson himself gives color to the be
lief In a bulletin to-day In which he
Bays:
"Late afternoon break on sales of
10.000 shares for Western man who
bought at 40. He has 30.000 left,
jrhich I will probably sell to-morrow.
i Sell your Amalgamated at best and
don't repurchase at any price until
1 management changes under reorgan
ization. Xo possibility of completion
of Heinze settlement being sprung. I
vill personally ask court for injunc
tion on ground of fraud."
The street thinks that Lawson
/*"Â«i<M.ba*-Â«Rogers and his- associates
had sold out Amalgamated and "got
the jump on them:"
ARMOUR UNLOADS WHEAT.
CHICAGO, Dec. 7.â Armour & Co.
created a panic in the Board of Trade
to-day by throwing on the market
5,000,000 bushels of wheat. The scene
was one of the most exciting witnessed
in years. Many options dropped 2&ic
and December suffered a relapse of
2 Vic.
While the panic was on the first
ereat break in the stock market since
the banning of the present bull
movement was manifested by a de
cline all along the line. Amalgamated
i Copper leading the downward course.
Hurling an estimated line of 5,000,000
bushels of wheat into tho pit, the Ar
mour forces, supported by other strong
interests, put the bulls in wild retreat.
At times, when the liquidation was
strongest, the excitement in the pit
bcrdered on insanity.
"A lot of people think that Armour
took a great loss when he dumped his
big lin<i to-day," said a trader; "but
I feel confident that even at the low
prices he came out a fair winner."
PLEASED AT PRESIDENT'S
WORDS ON INSURANCE
Attorney Beck of Mutual Life Tells
What It 3Ieans for the
Business.
Special DiFpatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Dec. 7.â Assistant At
torney General James M. Beck, who
argued the Northern Securities case in
the Circuit Court and who is now spe
cial counsel for the Mutual Life In
surance Company, said to-day:
"No feature of the President's mes
sage was more noteworthy than his
brief but emphatic recommendation
that Congress should bring insurance
.within Federal supervision- He force
fully 'calls attention to the fact that
great corporations 'can become such
only by engaging in interstate com
merce.' This recognition of the fact
that insurance plays an important part
in the interstate commercial inter
course of the nation is a new departure.
Other Presidents have recognized that
the foreign business of American life
insurance companies constituted an im
portant part of our foreign commercial
relations. Thus, President Cleveland,
in his message of December 2, 1895, re
ferred to the 'vast business* which
American insurance companies had de
veloped in foreign countries, and re
ferring to the attempts to exclude them
he expressed an opinion that we should
cot 'silently acquiesce in vexatious
hindrances to the enjoyment of our
share of the legitimate, advantages of
proper trade relations.*'
"During the administrations of Presi
dents Cleveland, Harrison and McKIn
ley the State Department repeatedly
exercised Its influence, through diplo
matic channels, to prevent unjust dis
crimination by foreign nations against
this feature of our foreign trade rela
tions. The Federal Government has,
however, been embarrassed in protect
ing the rights of, American companies
in foreign lands by the absence of any
Congressional, recognition of the na
tional and International character of
insurance. President Roosevelt's rec
ommendation will be valuable in safe
guarding our Interests In foreign coun
tries at a time when certain foreign
nations are attempting to deny Amer
ican companies equal rights in their
territory. The President gives to the
vast business of life insurance that for
which the American companies have
long and most, earnestly soughtâ the
seal of national recognition.
"It seems strange that such recogni
tion should have been delayed until the
business of .the. United ' States '. should
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. THURSDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1904.
ENTIRE PORT ARTHUR FLEET DOOMED
TO CERTAIN DESTRUCTION.
Warships Helpless
Against Japa
nese Guns.
TOKIO, Dec. 8, 11 a. m.â Imperial
headquarters has made the following
announcement:
"The result of the bombardment of
Port Arthur by our large caliber guns
on the 7th inst. was very good-. Many
effective hits were made against the
battleships Peresviet and Po-bieda and
the protected cruiser Pallada. In con
sequence the Peresviet caught fire and
at 3:15 o'clock the Pobleda listed to
starboard."
TOKIO,' Dec. 7. â The headquarters of
the Japanese army in front of Port
Arthur has reported, confirming the
disabling of the Russian battleships
Retvizan and Poltava and stating that
the cruiser Bayan # is aground. The re
port goes on to say:
"Owing to the plunging fire from
203-Meter Hill the enemy has * with
drawn to Akasaka Hill. On December
6 our forces occupied an entire fort at
1 p. m. Subsequently our forces, after
dislodging the enemy, occupied an
eminence north of Suerhkou and two
eminences north of Sanlichian at 3
p. m. On December <5 at 4 p. m., in
response to the request of the bearer
of the enemy's flag of truce, an armis
tice of five hours was granted for the
removal of the dead."
The commander of the Japanese na
val guns in front of Port Arthur, tele
graphing on December 6, says:
"An observation taken from 203- I
Met^r Hill shows that the turret-ship ]
Poltava is sunk and that the battle- I
ship Retvizan is listing heavily to |
port. Observations taken on December j
6 covered the results of the bombard
ment on December 5. We are now tak- '
Ing observations from a hill near Shu
shiying.
"Since December 2 we have daily
bombarded the enemy's fleet lying
south of Paiyu Mountain. From- that
point only the masts and funnel-tops
of the battleships Pobieda, Retvizan
or the cruiser Pallada could be seen,
and it was impossible to count the
number of our shells taking effect. On
other ships explosions resulting from
our shells could be seen, but owing
to their positions behind the hills it
was difficult exactly to identify them.
"The total of our shells taking ef
fect on the enemy's ships were as fol
lows: On a vessel of the Pobleda ,
type, 34; on the battleship Retvizan or
the cruiser Pallada, 31; on the turret
ship Poltava, 11. Besides these, 50
other shells struck, from which ex
plosions followed.
"On December 5 seven shells struck
the battleship Pobleda, and at about
3.30 p. m. a big explosion was observed
south of Paiyu Mountain, resulting
from the effect of our shells,, evidently,
on a powder magazine.
"The successful result of the bom
bardment on December 5 is inspiring
our men to still greater effort."
\
The Poltava was an armored turret
ship of 10,9^0 tons displacement and
11,255 indicated horsepower. She : was
built in St. Petersburg in 1S94 and went
into commission in 1898. Her cost of
construction was nearly S6.000.000. Her
armament consisted of four 12-inch,
twelve 5.9-inch and thirty-four smaller
caliber breech-loading rifle guns of
the Russian-Krupp patterns. She had
a crew of 700 men. She had a speed of
1Â«.2 knots.
Th-: Retzivan is a battleship of 12,700
tons displacement and 16,000 indicated
horsepower. She was built in Phila
delphia in 1902. Her armament con
sists of four 12-inch, twelve 6-inch,
twenty 3-inch, twenty 3-pounder and
six 1-pounder guns of Russian-Krupp
pattern. Her speed is 18 knots per
hour.

BERLIN, Dec. 8. â According to a

Mobilizing More. Troops.
ST. PETERSBURG. Dec. 7. â Orders
have been issued for the mobilization
of the second Volga regiment and the
Terek Cossacks.
have reached Its present amazing de
velopment.
"A business which has in force over
17,000,000 contracts of insurance, whose
annual income exceeds $500,000,000 and
whose accumulated assets exceed $2,
000,000,000 obviously enters most inti
mately into the commercial life of the
American people.
"The reason for this delay is not far
to seek. When insurance was in its in
fancy the Supreme Court expressed the
opinion that insurance was not com
merce. In all of the so-called insurance
cases, however, the validity of State
statutes enacted in the absence of Fed
eral legislation was alone in question.
"The Supreme Court has never passed
upon the validity of- an act of Congress
affirmatively regulating interstate or
foreign insurance. Their probable opin
ion is indicated by the recent decision
in the lottery cases, where a lottery
ticket was held to be a 'subject of com
merce' and its carriage from State to
State the subject of Congressional leg
islation. If a lottery ticket is a subject
of commerce a policy of Insurance, less
aleatory in character,' must equally be
so. To hold otherwise would be to
'strain at a gnat and swallow a camei.'
"If Congress shall follow the recom
mendation of the President . an im
portant advance will be -made in thâ¬
development of this great business, and
I believe the Supreme Court will sus
tain It. Such regulation need not.be
exclusive of the rights of the States to
protect their citizens from fraudulent
transactions or to tax property within
their borders. I am satisfied that the
great life insurance comnanies would
welcome Federal supervision. Notwith
standing recent ill-advised and for the
most part malicious diatribes against
these companies, no business Is con
ducted by abler men and none with less
secrecy. Most of the principal compa
nies exhibit to every policy holder each
year an exact statement of -their: in
vestments, and for many : years they
have â  submitted the most . intimate de
tails of their business to the Insurance
departments of many States and for
eign countries., I believe they will wel
come Federal supervision as: another
safeguard for the interests of the policy
holders." . â¢
St. Petersburg Now
Realizes End
Is Near.
ST. PETERSBURG. Dec. 8. 2:20
a. m;â Foreign telegrams received here
stating that the Japanese have suc
ceeded in mounting heavy guns on
203-Meter Hill are regarded as seriously
significant and have created a deep de
pression at the War Office. If the re
ports ef the sinking of the Russian
warships in the harbor of Port Arthur
ere confirmed, it destroys the last hope
of a sortie, and when me end comes
nothing remains but to sink those that
â¢remain in deep water, to prevent them
from falling Into the hands of the en
emy. \
The War Office is unable to N identify
Akasaka Hill. Evidently it is a'Jap
anese name.
The importance of 203-Meter Hill to
the garrison is- evidenced by General
Stoessel's desperate efforts to recapture
it. . â  '
ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 7.âAccord
ing to a story current in high circles
here Russia's efforts some, time ago to
negotiate the purchase of seven Argen
tine and Chilean warships have had a
curious seauel. The two South Ameri
can countries declined to sell the ves
sels direct to Russia, fearing the pos
sibility of being subsequently held lia
ble to Day Japan heavy damages, as
Great Britain was in the Alabama case.
At that time the question of selling to
a third party as an. intermediary was
discussed, and the possibility of Tur
key playing the role was suggested.
But Argentina and Chile steadfastly
declined to entertain any proposition
without a guarantee against future
liability.
According to the story Russia then
abandoned the project, whereupon
Great Britain stepped in, offering to
advance the money to Turkey to buy
the ships in return for certain conces
sions which would permit Great Brit
ain to erect a second Gibraltar on the
coast of Yemen, opposite Perim Island,
which would give Great Britain control
of the lower entrance to the Red Sea.
Negotiations between Great Britain
and Turkey along these lines are said
to be now progressing. It is added that
Russia is so much alarmed over the re
port that an emissary has been dis
patched to Constantinople to investi
gate and block the game.
General Kuronatkin in a telegram to
the Emperor mentions Japanese at
tacks on SinchinDU and Soudgianin,
both of which were repulsed, and an
important outnost affair on the right
wing, where the Russians routed and
bayoneted a Japanese guard.

Czar Orders More
Vessels to the
Far East.
. LONDON, pec. 8.â According to a SL
Petersburg dispatch to the Daily Mail
the Emperor on Wednesday decreed the
dispatch to the Far East of a third
squadron, comprising the battleships
Paul I and Slava, which will be com
pleted as speedily as possible, five older
battleships, five cruisers and forty tor
pedo-boat destroyers. The whole squad
ron, the dispatch adds, it is hoped will
be fitted out in two months. Probably
it will be commanded by either Vice
Admiral Dnubassoff or Vice Admiral
Chouknin. It is further asserted that
no decision ha3 been reached regarding
the Black Sea fleet.
* A -report from Tientsin states that
the Japanese shell fire at Port Arthur
also sank the Russian battleship Peres
viet, but no further news concerning
the fortress has reached London.
The Daily Telegraph's correspond
ent in front of Port Arthur, cabling
under date of December 7, says that
the Russians ceased their attempts to
recapture 203-Meter Hill on December
6. In an uncompleted account of the
fighting that preceded the capture of
the hill the same correspondent ap
plauds the. magnificent defense the
Russians made and the clever handling
of the defensive forces against the re
peated Japanese feints and enveloping
movements en masse.
In connection with. the story from St.
Petersburg regarding negotiations with
Turkey for the purchase of Argentine
and Chilean cruisers a curious feature
is the fact that the Ottoman embassy

statement declaring that therjr was no
foundation for rumors that Tttrkey was
purchasing or intending "t6 ; purchase
Argentine men-of-war, "either for her
own use or for the , use of any other

HEAVY FIRING HEARD.
Big Siege Guns In Action Along -the
Stmkhe River.
. MUKDEN, Dec. 7. â Cannonading
of great volume was heard around
Poutiloff Hill and the railway yester
day morning. It continued during the
day and evidently, owing to the treÂ«
mendous noise, reached Its height
from 3 to 5 o'clock in the afternoon.
It was unlike anything of the kind
heard heretofore except at Port Ar
thur.
This tremendous noise is believed to
have been due to the constantly in
creasing number of siege guns of
large caliber, all of which seemed to
be in use yesterday.
Rumors of an attack by the Jap
anese at various dates have been cur
rent for the last two weeks and the
Impression prevails that yesterday's
heavy bombardment was in anticipa
tion of the assumption of the offens

LONDON, Dec. 7. â Those in close

From the latest advices it appears

tration of Afghan troops at Kabul for
some time past.

were touched. In none are the reserves
exhausted. The regular establishment
includes a guard and grenadier corps,
two cavalry corps and twenty-three

Caucasus, two In Turkestan and the
Siberian corps. Ten of these corps are
now at the front. Four more European
corps and five rifle brigades are also
under orders to fill up the three armies
to 150,000 men each. The present plans
contemplate the use of only eight of the

"UNCLE GEORGE" AS AN AUTHOR
Dean of Bohemian Club Writes \ Charmingly
) of His Eventful Eighty -Seven Years.
"Uncle George" Bromley's book, "The
Long Ago and the Later On," will soon
reach an expectant public. If It fails to
attain universal recognition' as "the;
book of the year" it certainly Will be
awarded that distinction b>v every C?.::
fornian and thousands of folk â some
of them widely celebratedâ elsewhere.
It is more than its author claims for it.
" 'Tie simply," he says by way of pref
ace, " a narrative pertaining to an
eventful life of eighty-seven years, in
which its joys have so far outweighed
Its sorrows that I would dearly lqve.to
live it all over again." .That's a true
reflex of "Uncle. George's", fine "spirit,
but it conveys no hint of the historic
end literary value of his work. It does |
riot prepare the reader to find a volume
in which there is not one Cull line. '-In
stead of contributing to posterity the
usual autobiographical- sacrifice of
truth to egotism, "Uncle George" has j
â¢written in the same vein of self-efface- j
ment that makes his oral reminiscences ,
so beloved by 'Bohemia. And his "simr j
pie narrative" is sometimes as thrill
ing as 'Treasure Island," and at all;
times delightfully told. The chapters j
covering his early experiences in San
Francisco will be read when more pre- J
tentious histories of the city will be
neglected, because they combine com- '
prehensive glimpses of the life of the
time with anecdotal interest.
When it is realized that "Uncle
Cleorgo'was an actor' before Jefferson
essayed Ilin, and that he was an Af
rican explorer many years prior to
Stanley's discovery of Livingstone, only
a faint idea of the worth' of his well
told memoirs has been obtained:' For
his subsequent career embraces steam
>>oaiing. railroading, j office-holding,
hoto) -keeping and half a dozen other
vocations in California ere he settled
down to f?end tho winter of his re
markable life among the friends he best
lovesâ his cronies of the Bohemian
Club of San Francisco.
Of his birth he writes: "History has
recorded the occurrence of many great
and important events during the first
quarter of the nineteenth century, but
the event of most vital importance to
me occurred on the morning of April 14,
3817, in the city of Norwich, Conn. For
it was thpn and there that I was born."
When he was only 14 years of age his
pood mother sent him on a sealing voy
age to South Africa, "so that her mind
xvould be eased as to his whereabouts
*Â»' nights." and then he pursued the sea
and river navigation until he was ap
pointed "second mate of his father's
ropewalk." where he served four years
*re the call of the sea again lured him.
He arrived in San Francisco on January
*. 1851. and found a comfortable berth in
the customs service awaiting him. This
is one of his reminiscences of that in
teresting period:
It war during the exciting times of the early
fifties that the young men of the rlty. be
coming painfully aware of the demoralizing
effects of mixed drinks, orpaniied a society
known as the Young Men's Moral Reform Club,
with the motto. "How happy is the man who
never drink*." This was a conundrum which
none of the tnt-mlxr* was able to solve, but
the moial reform feature of the club was tha'.
Us members were never to drink mixed drink- 5 .
I had the honor of belro? elected the first presi
dent. There were twelve members, and our
meetings were held at the Mission on lhÂ» laÂ»i
Saturday night ol the month, with the Cliff
Houte omnibus to convey us to and from oCr
place ot meeting. But one after another broke
the pledge and was borne out to Lone- Moun
tain Cemetery, until there were but two sur
vivors, "lit- Superintendent of Public Instruc
tion and mystlf. In 1SI>5 I went East and my
fellow member of the Reform Club must have
been beguiled from the paths of rectitude, fcr I
he. too. died and I am now the sole repre* nta. I
tive of the organization which was famous in |
its cey ar.d generation. If my examp'.e J>hall
have beÂ»n the means of persuading young men
to abstain from mixed drinks end confine th-m
*elves to the moderate use of whisky straight
I shall feel that I have not overhauled the
storehouse* of memory In vain.
Of seasonable interest is "Uncle
George's" description of his first
Christmas in San Francisco. He says:

In 1872 the Bohemian Club was or
ganized, and as "Uncle George," then
fulfilling a street sweeping contract,
read from time to time in the news
papers of its do-ings, he felt a strong
desire to become a member, but when
he "came to know* that it wasmade up
of men whose lives were devoted to art,
literature, the drama and other high
toned callings," he concluded that he
did not come within hailing distance
of the qualifications requisite. Al
tho-ugh his successful dealing with the
Board of Supervisors in obtaining the
street-sweeping contract "might have
been a qualification sufficient for a
member' of â  the State Legislature, it
was of no earthly account in an appli
cation for membership'in the Bohemian
Club." But he was Invited to Join, and
he did Join, and from that day to the
present he has been the club favorite.
His first night in Bohemia is whimsi
cally described. When he arrived at
his home in South Park his wife asked
him what time it was, and he said
"Ten minutes past 10." The little wo
man arope, looked at his watch and ex
claimed:
"Ten minutes past 10? Why, it lacks
only ten minutes of 2!"
"Is that so?" said George. "Why.
bless my eoul, how time flies! J had
no idea that I have been home "so long."
He continues:
Thus rndod my first n!sht in Bohemia, with
in whose hallowed wall* I have for almost
thirty years enjoyed seme of Iho happiest mo
ments of my lite, and associated with the
moft . eÂ«-nial, whole-noulÂ«Â»<i gentleman I have
ever known, and that is why I have 8lven~si>

After that he was closely Identified
with the now world-famous club, and
about half of his book is made up of
reminiscences pertaining to it. Within
its walls or. through his connection with
it he met on the plain ground of good
fellowship some men whose names are
household words throughout the world,
and his experiences with them make
mighty interesting reading. His life in
China, where he served as American
Consul at Tientsin, is charmingly nar
rated the volume concludes with a
number of poetic tributes of friendship
to the author written by friends at
home ar.d far away.

UNSAFE BANKS
BEING WATCHED
SACRAMENTO, Dec. 7. â With ref
erence to a dispatch from Los Ange
les saying he intended to revoke a
number of bank charters granted by
the Secretary of State. Governor Par
dee said he knew nothing about the
matter, as it was entirely within the
Jurisdiction of the Bank Commission
ers. He said he was convinced wild
cat banks are a hadything and that
some of the 'charters granted never
should have been issued, but that
Vhere was no way out of it at the
time the charters were applied for.
The Governor said it was his opinion
the Bank Commissioners had the pow
er to compel such banks to increase
their surplus to insure the safety^ of
the public.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 7.â It is re
ported here that there is a possibility
of Governor Pardee's revoking a con
siderable-number of bank charters
which were granted by the Secretary
of State during the interim existing
between the time, when the statute
governing incorporations ceased to be
operative by reason of repeal,- some
two years ago, and the time when the
new law went into effect a month lat
er. It is said that about seventy-five
charters were gratitod during, this
time, most of-. which were merely se
cured for speculative- purposes and, for
use in incorporati-r. commercial and
financial institutions with small cap
italization. About fifty of these char
ters still remain unused. It Is reported,
and for sale. In the opinion of many
these constitute a, menace to sound
financial institutions in that they are
likely to be used and, in fact, it is
claimed, many have already been used

MAKES ATTACK
ON INFORMATION
Counsel for Young Weber
Argues Thai Client ,Was
Illegally Held for Trial
MOVES FOR DISMISSAL
Asserts Testimony Fails to
Show That Crime Was Com
mitted in Placer 'County
AUBURN, Dec. 7.â A large crowd of
spectators, among whom were many
women,' assembled in court this morn
ing lo hear Adolph Weber's plea to
the charge of 'murdering his mother.
Attorney Tabor, counsel for the pris
oner, moved to set aside the Informa
tion on the grounds "that Weber had
liot'been legally committed by a mag
istrate; that the venue had not been
-proven: that there was nothing in the
evidence to show that the shot that
killed Mrs. Weber was fired in Placer
County or that she died in Placer
County or that the person who fired
the shot was in Placer County at tho
time.
Attorney Tabor then argued alons
the line that Weber was seen to pass
from the Weber home at 6:S0 o'clock
on the r.lght of the tragedy and later
wa's seen at the postotfiee and Cohen's
store before' the. fire bell rang, white
the piano was heard at the Weber
home about 6:45 o'ciock. He said that
all of the evidence showed that the de
fendant was 'never' known to own a
pistol, nor was he connected with the
pistol offered in evidence. Tabor next
reviewed the testimony- given at the
preliminary hearing. Weber then
whispered to him, whereupon he spoke
of the threat referred to by Mrs. Snow
den that. "her turn. would come next."
Tabor said th<; remark was probably
misunderstood or misinterpreted, at
all events it. did not connect his client
with the murder.
District -Attorney Robinson replied
at .length, to Tabor's argument, and
quoted a . Supreme Court decision to
the effeqt that an information is a
deposition, and that if the defendant
does not dispute the jurisdiction of the
court at the time it is presented the
jurisdiction is established.
The morning was consumed in argu
ment, and the Judge announced that
hÂ» would take the matter under adÂ«
visement until 10 o'clock Thursday
morning.
The Grand Jury investigation into
the bank robbery will be concluded to
morrow morning. It is believed that
an indictment against Adolph Weber
upon, that charge .will' be filed.
Claimants for the Weber estate are
bobbing up every day. There came
into town yesterday a man giving the
name of Lawrence, a German, and a
minister by profession. He claims ,J.o
represent a brother of Julius Weber
living in Oklahoma. The alleged broth
er's name !s Luclwlg Risenweber. Law
rence claims" that Julius Weber's true
name was Julius Risenweber. The au
thorities/give no credence to Law
rence's story. Julius Weber always
claimed that his relatives were, dead.'

CANFIELD NOW
IN LAW'S GRIP
NEW YORK, Dec. 7. â Richard A.
Canfield and David Bucklin, respect
ively^ proprietor and manager of what
is said to be the most exclusive gam
bling house in this country, were in
dicted by the Grand Jury to-day on
the charge of maintaining a gambling
house at 5 East Forty-fourth street.
They were then taken before Judge
Cumming and pleaded guilty to the
indictments.
Canfield's house is situated next
door to the city's most fashionable
restaurant and all his patronage came
the wealthiest men in the c}ty.
For years It was imnossible to obtain
evidence against him because only
people known personally to Canfleld
or 'Bucklin or vouched for by one of
the regular patrons of the house were
admitted.
District Attorney Jerome several
years ago began a determined effort
to secure the necessary evidence and
to this end he subpenaed Jesse Lew
isohn, a member of a prominent busi
ness firm, and called upon Lewisohn
to answer whether he had ever gam
bled In Canfleld's house. Lewisohn
refused to answer on the 'ground that
he w r as. not required, to give a reply
which. might tend .to incriminate or
degrade him. ..
.'.' : A'-- special . act was passed: by the
Legislature, to provide immunity, to
Witnesses who might testify .as'Lew
isohn had been asked to do... Still
Lewisohn declined to answer on the
ground that the special act was un
constitutional. He .fought the case to
the Court of * -neals. the highest In
the State, and recently that court
handed down a decision sustaining the
act and holding that Lewisohn should
testify. Shortly afterward it was giv

Receives Invitation to Visit Louisville
in Case lie Takes Trip to
; V "'-,.- the South.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7. â President
Roosevelt to-day received an Invita
tion to visit' Louisville, Ky., next
spring and he gave a conditional ac
ceptance. The President told his vis
itors that unless tX ere should be an
extraordinary session of Congress next
spring â a subject on which, he added,
his own mind was not quite clear â he
probably would go to San Antonio,
Tex., to attend the annual reunion of
his old regiment of Rough Riders. The
President said he expected to visit, on
Jiis way\,to;SarÂ»:Antonlo,!Roswell, Ga.,
which was the home of his mother. It
is, likely that other stops may be made
on the trip to Texaa. From San An
tonio the President may take a trip
into the mountains of Colorado to get
some hunting. The .hunting expedi
tion may consume two or three weeks.

the desire for liquor and putting thÂ«

McKanna effects a complete cure in three)
days without the use of dangerous hy-

after effects. Dr. McKanna's treatment
Is absolutely safe and cannot harm tha

OF FRUIT GROWERS
Railroad Service Discussed
â¦
Passage of an Act Making It Unlawful
to Give Rebates Is Favored.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
SAN JOSE, Dec. 7.â There was an in
creased attendance at the State fruit
Growers' convention to-day, and a lit
tle spice was added to the proceedings
by a wrangle over the report of the
transportation committee. Immediate
ly after the convention had .been called
to order the delegates passed a vote of
thanks to the ladies of the San Jose
Grange for the reception and entertain
ment tendered them last evening.
Alden Anderson, Lieutenant Gov
ernor of California, read a report of the
operations of the California Fruit Dis
tributors' Association. It was in part
&8 follows:
Retarding thÂ« past season and the shipment
of freeh Deciduous Fruits. I regret to say that
it fca* not been a propitious one, principally
because of adverse climatic conditions. This
Is particularly true of peaches, there being
â¢hipped thin year only 559 cars, as against IMi
cars la*t year.
The quality of the peaches that were had
tr.it year was not up to the usual standard
and the consequence was that many places
turned their attention to the peach growing
districts in the south for their supplies and
the ecarcity of peaches here for shipment re
sulted also in a curtailed outlet in outside
markets for other varieties of fruit that
would have, gone in the cars, of which peaches
would have been the chief assortment.
CHERRIES. â The crop of cherries was prac
tically about the- same as . last year. When
the season was well under way a very heavy
north wind bruised the fruit remaining- en the
trees to that the rest of the shipments did not
realize the prices that the market conditions
and the quantity of supplies -would have Justi
fied.
APRICOTS. â Owins to the marked rhortage
of thin variety of fruit in the early shipping
districts there were only shipped Â«7 cars, as
tpe'.r.-t 241 cars la*t year. Prices were satis
factory for those shipped.
PLUMS A.VU PRLXES. â There were fchip-
I- â : 10G3 car:;, as against 1145 cars last year.
On thf whole, returns for this variety cf fruit
were satisfactory.
PEARS. â The total number of cars shipped
was considerable in excess of that of last sea.
f< n and the excess was wholly in Bartlett
team, fall and winter varieties beine about
\hf same quantity as last year. There was
more competition in this variety of fruit than
has besn the case for a number of years, and
thÂ» bulk of them was shipped at a time when
th*re were heavy supplies of southern fruits.
The markets became demoralized and returns
fiesÂ«ral!y were not cood or satisfactory. How
Â«"\*-r. thÂ»> greater quantity of this fruit was
purchased by shirpers ar.d the loss did not fail
upon the crow*rs.
GRAPES. â There were shipped 1431 cars of
irrapes. as sgrair.st 1SO4 cars last season. The
unusual and excessive rains cf September were
responsible for a thrirkage in the total volume
Of cra:><? shipments that would have been
rr.ad* of SOO or 900 cars, and seriously affect
ed tnÂ«> prices received for all the grapes ship
ped E.fter i he heavy storms, as the berries ab
sorbed s<Â» much moisture that when they were
packed in cars for shipment they developed
much decay.

I Fellows to San Frencisco was better than last
[ season. After, the incidents above mentioned
I s'erv'oa was about on a par with that of last
j Mason.
This year only five new cities .were added
{ to thÂ» Urt <>f carload distributing .points and
i no greater prcgresg was made In that direction
! on account of lack of "variety of assortment
j for the loading out of suitable cars for the
i t-iraller cities.
Mr. Anderson also read a paper on
"Widening of Our Fresh Fruit Market."
It treated of the shipping- of fruit and
j the control o^ shipments so that there
v.ould be no glutting of the markets in
the East-' - â¢
! PRIVATE OWNERSHIP OF CARS.
I The report of the committee on trans
| portation, .._. read by R. D. Stephens,
chairman, then came up. It declared
that private ownership and control of
refrigerator cars used for the ship
ments of California fruit was Inimical
to the interest of the fruit growers and
shippers, as affording an opportunity
for discrimination and favoritism. It
was asserted that all cars should be
owned by the railroads and all shippers
should have equal facilities and be
upon equal terms. The report protested
against the, renewal of contracts with
refrigerator 'car lines, objected to the
private ownership of refrigerator cars,
declared that the growers who are not ,
engaged in shipping are opposed to the .
private ownership of the cars and be
lieve the time, has come when they
should be relieved of paying heavy
tribute to this, the worst of all monop
olies. The report added that refrigera
tion had done more to retard the pro
gress and prosperity of the State than
all other things combined, for the rea
son that it possesses the power to al
most wholly, if not quite, control the
marketing of California's fruit pro
ducts. Stephens referred at length to
the train service of the fjuit trains, and ;
! said the adoption of a reasonably fast j
I and regular time schedule in the trans- j
I portation of our fresh fruit shipments I
is second only to the elimination of all
private car lines from the business.
As soon as Stephens had finished
reading the report Alden Anderson
arose and demanded to know who ap
pointed the transportation committee.
President Cooper stated -that the
committee was appointed at the last
meeting and stated that Mr. Anderson
was also a member of the committee.
Anderson then demanded the privilege
of filing a minority report, which he
did. The minority report was in the
form of a resolution "that the conven
tion reiterate everything that we have
ever said or done in the way of de
manding satisfactory service for fruit
by the railroads, and that It directs its
representatives in Congress to urge the
passage of an act amending the Inter
state bill making it unlawful to give re
bate in any way, or manner." .â â . â  .:
DISCUSSION*' IS ' rrETKRRED.
A dozen members sprang to their feet
to join in the discussion, but President
Cooper said that all discussion would
tie deferred until aftef 'afl the. papers
had been" read.
A paper on "Cured Fruit Marketing
at Home and Abroad" was then read
by F. W. Crandall of Soroste.
Paul Shoup, the district agent of the
Southern Pacific, . read a . paper on
"Fruit Transportation," in which he
showed the cost and expense of carry
ing the cars.
General S. P. Denison of Covina, on
invitation from the convention, ad
dressed the delegates on "The South
ern California Fruit Exchanges."
Discussion of the reports of the com
mittee on transportation was then
taken up. and after some wrangling
both reports w-ere referred back to the
original committee, to report In the
afternoon.
At the afternoon session A. R. Sprague,
chairman of the committee of fifteen
appointed to devise a way of providing
a market for the fruit, read his report.
It recommended the forming of local
associations of growers and the selling
of their product through a central
agency, and also a plan for advertis
ing the fruit abroad. - -
A resolution was introduced by G. W.
Henning to the effect that the rate of
20 cents per 100 pounds on fruit in bags
was the cause of the declining trade
and excluded Eastern buyers in the lo
cal market. It further requested the
Transportation Traffic Association to
equalize the rate on dried fruit so that
Eastern buyers will be on an equal
footing with local buyers. The resolu
tion was referred to the resolutions
committee.
-MANAGER SPROULE IS IIEARD.
The committee appointed at the last
meeting to consider the paper, "Taxa
tion in California," by John Touhy, re
ported. The present system of taxa
tion in California, according to the re
port, bears oppressively, on realty and
is criminally light on personal prop
erty. A. revision of the present sys
tem was recommended. The report
favored the appointment of a non
partisan Tax Commission by the next
Legislature to arrange a scientific and
equitable system of taxation.
"The Benefits of Organization" was
the subject of a paper read by F. H.
Babb of San Jose. A. T. J Reynolds
presented a paper on "Why Farmers
Should Support the Growers' Co-oper
ative Agency." A. R. Sprague read a
paper on "Agricultural Organization"
and C. D. Harvey one on "Stumbling
Blocks in the Way of Co-operation."
The committee to .whom was re
ferred the majority and minority re
ports of the committee on transporta
tion reported. A . long discussion was
started on the adoption of the two-re
ports. While it was at its height W.
A. Sproule, general traffic manager of
thr: Southern Pacific, asked permission
to speak. He said it would require
$s.000,000 to equip the Southern Pa
cific, with a full supply of refrigerator
cars. It was cheaper for the com
pany to rent the cars from the Ar
mour Company, which it did, than
build- them, as most-of the year. the
cars stand idle. For half an hour
Sproule stood on the platform and an
swered questions. The lateness of the
hcur shut off the debate. On a vote
being taken Anderson's minority re
port was adopted by a vote of 67 to 9.
There is but little difference in the
two reports. The denunciation of the
refrigerator companies is, eliminated
In the report adopted, but otherwise
it follows Stephens' report and de
mands an amendment of the Interstate
law so as to prohibit rebates.

THREE BANKERS
UNDER ARREST
BUFFALO, Dec. 7.â Former Presi
dent Emery,- Cashier Paul^ Werner and
Assistant Cashier William P. Ludakc
of the German Bank, -which was closed
by the officials several days ago, have
been arrested on-a;charge of grand
larceny.
The warrants- of arrest were issued
on the application of'E. M. Block, a
pawnbroker of this city. Block charges
that a New York draft which he bought
at the German Bank ten. or fifteen
minutes ' before it closed' on Monday,
giving a check therefor, has been re-
turned, marked "No funds." He says
he has since learned that the German
Bank had withdrawn all Its funds
from the New York bank on Saturday
last. â  â¢
Emery, Warner and Ludake were
held for a hearing to-morrow. Warner
and Ludake declared the German Bank
had to its credit In the New York bank
funds in excess of $100,000. The refusal
to pay the draft, they say ,, was due to
the fact that when State Banking Su
perintendent Kilburn took charge of
the bank he- immediately -telegraphed
all banks In which the German Bank
had deposits, instructing them not to
pay out any more money on account of
the German Bank. .
State Superintendent of Banking Kil
burn has Issued a statement, In which
he announced that two trust companies
of Buffalo have offered to act as re
ceiver for the German Bank upon
terms which he regards as very ,ad
vantageous to the depositors.

POLICE FEEL SURE
OF KINIRY CASE
Prisoner's Confessions Are
of Vital Importance.
Belief That Evidence Will Be, Complete
Oakland Office San Francisco Call
1016 Broad\va$. Dec. 7.
David Kiniry has made admissions
to the police that directly connect him
with the tragic killing of Policeman
James H. Smith. Not only does the
prisoner tell the police that he was
present at the shooting, but he has
confessed that Frank Goldstein, his
companion, and himself were bent on
burglary at the time they were accost
ed by the patrolman at Fourteenth
and Jackson streets. More than that
Kiniry has said enough to convince
the police that Goldstein and himself
had selected the residence of Julius
Abrahamson at Fourteenth and Madi
son streets to plunder that night. The
encounter with Smith blocked that
robbery.
Kiniry has said that he had selected
a big white house a block from where
the shooting occurred. The burglars
had been watching the place, but had
not attempted to enter because the oc
cupants had not gone downstairs to
supper. When they met the police
man Kiniry and Goldstein were walk
ing around the block to pass away the
time until ttiey should be. positive the
upper part of the residence they in
tended to enter was unoccupied.
KIMRY A CLIMBER.
Kiniry never committed burglaries
in the ordinary way of forcing doors
or windows within easy reach. His
specialty, "porch climbing" in police
parlance, called him to gain entrance
by way of upper floors.- It was in this
manner he had intended tp*- get into
the Abrahamson place w*n*en the coast
should seem clear for operations.
Still more have the police gained
from their frequent conversations
with the clever criminal. He has con
fessed that Goldstein and himself
committed the bruglary at the resi-

Epecial Diepatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Dec. 7.â Eleven jurors
had been sworn in at the trial of "Nan"
Patterson for the murder of Caesar
Young at the close of to-day's session
of the criminal branch of the Supreme
Court.- >
Of the 200 talesmen ninety-five had
been examined, and so many others
had been excused for various reasons
that only a score remained from whom
to draw the last Juror.
Instructions were issued to-day by
Justice Davis that no women shall be
admitted to the courtroom during the
tiial. !>:â Â£
Among the many stories in connec
tion with the case which have gained
general circulation Is one to the effect
that the defense may rest on the evi
dence submitted by the prosecution.
Miss Patterson has expressed a strong
desire to be at her father's home In
Washington for Christmas it is said,
and is willing to take chances to gain
that end. If the trial progress rap
idly 'the defense may call some wit
nesses, but even that is not certain. In
any event everything possible will be
done to get a verdict before Christmas
day.
Another rumor is that arrangements
have been completed assuring the ap
pearance durins the -trial of J. Morgan
Smith, an important witness, who. has
been missing since a day or two after
the tragedy. Smith is "Nan" Patter
son's brother-Jn-law. It is said that
Hyman B. Stern, a pawnbroker, will
testify that Smith purchased the re

THE SANÂ« FRANGISCO GALL- THURSDAY; .DECEMBER'S. 1001
I dence of William Bannan, 1457 Har
rison street, from which they realized
I several thousand dollars' worth of
j jewels. This crime was done the night
before Patrolman Smith was killed. .
/There has been a purpose in Kin
iry's apparent willingness to talk
about his career in Oakland and es
j pecially to give information to the po
i lice about his connection with
j Smith's death. All the while in his
j talks with the police Kiniry has'at
! tempted to show that Goldstein was
i the man who shot Smith and that he
j (Kiniry) was some distance away and
| running from the scene when the fatal
! shots were fired that cost both Smith
] and Goldstein their lives. But the Po
| lice Department has been at work to
. meet this phase of the case and they
I have succeeded in finding a witness
j who will contradict Kiniry's version
j of the occurrence.
' FIND GOOD WITNESS.
This witness, who will be produced
at the preliminary examination to
morrow, is Henry Herman, a coach
man, who saw enough of the occur
rences after the shooting to prove
that Kiniry has not told the truth
concerning some of the essential ele
ments of the case. The police also
have a witness to the shooting who
will tell a story identical with the
statements that Policeman Smith
made when he was dying.
Kiniry's admissions, coupled with a
mass of evidence that has been col
lected by the police, give the prosecu
tion every hope that a strong case of
murder will be shown and that the
accused burglar will be so closely
connected with it that no doubt will
remain as to his hand having been the
one that fired the fatal bullets.
The examination will be com
menced to-morrow morning before
Police Judge George Samuels.

OPPOSES USE
OF FISH TRAPS
At the session of the International
Seamen's Union yesterday Delegate
Rosenberg introduced a resolution ad
vocating the protection of the fishing
industry on the Pacific Coast. He says
that the business, which is one of vast
importance on this coast, is being rap
idly destroyed by the reckless methods
of Ihe fishermen. The resolution par
ticularly condemns the use of traps,
and urges that legislation be enacted
which will prohibit their use In the
future. The matter was referred to the
legislative committee, with power to
act.
It was ordered that a telegram be
sent to the Secretaries of the Navy,
War, Treasury and Commerce and La
bor and to Representative Livernash
expressing the sense of the convention
as opposed to the contemplated em
ployment of coolies dn navy colliers
and possibly other vessels of the United
States. . ' * \
Such a course, it was argued, would
be in violation of the Chinese exclu
sion law and contrary to that principle
of the admiralty law which regards an
American vessel as American soil.
Another resolution was adopted de
claring the departmental rulings under
which the shipment of Chinese . on
American vessels is permitted as being
in violation of the Chinese exclusion
laws, and urging that the President
and Congress see that the laws of the
nation are enforced as far as Chinese
exclusion is concerned.
All members of affiliated unions are
requested to do their utmost to. pre
vent the employment of Mongolians in
the . cooks' and stewards' departments
of vessels, and secure therein the em
ployment of union men so far as pos
sible.

JOINS PROTEST
TO CONGRESS
By Zoe Green TUiddiffe.
OAKLAND. Dec. -7.â Many members of the

day* the club as a body. Went 6n'recortf as be
ing' in the suffrage fight. There is a bill now
pending In Congress proposing to unite Okla
homa and Indian Territories into the State of
Oklahoma, and New Mexico and 'Arizona into
one State of Arizona. The bill itself is all
right, but one tiny word of three letters has
evoked a H'ldespreadlng protest ' from ever}'
woman in the land who is working for the
voting privilege â that one little word "sex" In
the fifth paragraph of sections 3 and 21. As
the bill now reads it places women on a level
with criminals, lunatics and ignoramuses, and
the suffragists have set up a howl that prom
ises to frishten the law builders at 'Washing
ton out of their senses â or should one say into
them?
Clubs all over the United States are being
asked to join in a general protest and the
Oakland Club promptly fell in line, for every
day the need is felt for laws that will
Btrencthen its power for good and even the
most conservative women of the club are be
rinninc to realize . that they will continue to
be handicapped so long as they are denied
rizhts that are given to vagabonds and illit
erate creatures, as well as men of intelligence
and learnlnc That is why the Oakland Club
put itself on record to-day as favoring suf
fra.e, by signing the protest that will go to
Washington. A motion was also carried by
the club to petition the Legislature to provide
for the support of vacation schools from the
public funds.
Superintendent of Schools J, W. McClymonds

COAST COLLEGE
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, Dec. 7.
President Benjamin Ide* Wheeler
has received suggestions from Wash
ington apropos of Professor Hilgard's
annual report, which referred with
special emphasis. to the need of a bet
ter equipped agricultural department
at the university."
Dr. A. C. True, director of the ex
periment stations of the United States
Department of Agriculture, has writ
ten to President Wheeler outlining
what seem to him to be the essential
needs of the university's agricultural
department and urging the adoption of
a plan to provide for such needs as
follows: .
1.. An agricultural building, riving adequate
office, lecture-room and laboratory facilities.
2.- A farm, accessible to Berkeley, properly
equipped for Instruction and research- purposes.
-3. If possible, the practice of your Legis
lature of making small appropriations for
specific investigations should be broken up and
in the place thereof lump-sum appropriations
for research work ba substituted. .
In connection with Professor Hil
gard's annual report from the depart
ment of agriculture, the professor has
spoken plainly of the attitude assumed
by some farmers and landowners of
the State who fail to assist the depart
ment in Its work of investigating the
cause and cure of alkali lands.' Ac
cording 'to Professor. Hilgard, many
farmers decline to admit *hat they
have any such land and so block the
efforts of the university men to assist
in reclaiming suchsoil. - T '
. Referring to; this feature of his
work, Professor Hilgard says that
oftentimes after a season's work, care
fully planned and carried out with
considerable expense, the co-operators
fail to make the. crucial observations
of crop results with the care and data
required, has led to the conclusion
that in order to render such co-opera
tive experiments really useful and con
clusive it will be necessary to detail
competent men to make the harvest
under full direction and therefore
wholly or partially at the expense of
the university.

GOSSIP IN FOLD
OF POLITICIANS
The ,word is being passed along the
legislative line that Jere Burke of San
Francisco and Jim Gillls of the State
Library have slated Billy Lamphrey
for sergeant at arms of the Assembly.
The story goes that Assemblymen
elect are told in San Francisco that
Jim Gillls represents "our people" in
Sacramento. There is a common Im
pression In political circles that the
seventy-five Republican Assemblymen
will undertake the task of organizing
the Assembly. The suggestion is of
fered to Assemblymen that they ascer
tain by direct inquiry whether Burke
and Gillis are authorized to speak for
any one other than Jere and Jim.
An old -.time politician yesterday re
marked: "It is all right for Jere Burke
and Jim Gillis to organize the Legisla
ture if they can fool the members Into
the belief that they have been delegat
ed by the organization or some other
power to take care of the lawmakers
and see that none stray beyond the
precincts of the State Library and
sergeant at arms' rooms for valuable
hints on legislation."
According to general political gossip
there will be a new departure at Sac
ramento next January. It is said that
the members of each branch of the
Legislature will look for Inside, rather
than for outride, light en. the subject
of . organization.
.Note is made of the fact that George
Rolley of Humboldt is making fair
progress in his campaign, for speaker
ship of the Assembly and is making
this headway on the theory that the
Assemblymen themselves , will de
termine the result. His supporters
contend that he is capable and worthy.
It would not surprise the politicians if
he should win the prize while others
desiring the honor were looking for
somebody to give "orders."
There is gossip to the effect that John
Stafford has the promise of substantial
support for the position of sergeant at
arms of the Assembly. It is pre
dicted that Senator Wolfe will be
chosen President pro tern, of the Sen
ate and that J. Steppacher will be
elected without opposition to the posi
tion of chief clerk of the Assembly.
Senators and Assemblymen repre
senting the counties of Los Angeles,
San Diego, Santa Barbara, Ventura,
San Bernardino. Orange and Riverside
met in Los Angeles yesterday and dis
cussed legislative .affairs.

OF IMMIGRATION LAWS
Question Involving Right of Chinese
to Land Is Submitted to
Highest Tribunal.
The cases of See SI Kum and her
son, Man Quong Kay, who were de
nied admission to this country by the
immigration officials, have been
passed up to the United States Su
preme Court for a final ruling. The
woman claimed to be a native of this
country and entitled to. land, but the
immigration officials ruled otherwise.
When . the case came before Judge de
Haven on habeas corpus proceedings
he decided that she was a native and
entitled to land. - District Attorney
Woodworth contends that the District
Court lacked jurisdiction to review a
decision of the immigration officials on
habeas corpus proceedings.
Mah Quong Kay claims to have been
born, in this country, but saya he was
taken to China when two years of age.
He Is now. 25 years old and it is con
tended that he forfeited his right to
citizenship by remaining in a foreign
country after â  reaching his majority.
Many, other delicate points of law are
involved and the decision is anxiously
awaited, as it will settle vexing ques
tions.
A. square foot of real estate is worth

DECISION. IN .FAVOR
OF THE IATX.. '.HEIRS
T. R. Coolcy Loses His FhrJit for a
Share of the Big â  .-,
- .' Estate.
The legal fight which has been waged
In the Superior Court for two year3
and nine months over the . claim for
three one-hundredths of the vast. Lax
estate as an additional attorney's . fee
for James II. Campbell was decided
yesterday by Judge Murasky In favor
of the defendants and now the con
troversy will be removed to the Su
preme Court.
The suit was brought by Thomas
Ross Cooley against Miller & Lux, the
Charles Lux heirs and the trustees of
the Miranda Lux estate, and It set
forth that Cooley. as CampbeH'3 as
signee, claimed a three one-hundredths
interest in the hundreds of thousands
of acres throughout the State of which
Lux. died a half owner. ThÂ« claim was
based upon an agreement whereby
Campbell was employed by the Eastern
heirs of Lux to look out for their In
terest in the estate- He received $37,000
in cash for his services, but contended
that the estate was worth 140.000,000
and he should have 3 per cent thereof.
The defendants maintained that the
estate was only worth $12,000,000 and
that Campbell had been pail in ful*.
Judge Murasky held that the rights
of the plaintiff, whatever they may
have been under the conveyance by
the heirs, are concluded by the decree
of distribution of the estate, made
seme years ago, and that as a conse
quence judgment In th a action muit
be for the defendants.

INDIAN GIRL SHOWS
FOUR BIG POLICEMEN
HOW SHE CAN BATTLE
Her Inherent Savagery Rages
When Blood Boils Civilized
Teachings Go for Naught. x
BY JAMES C. CRAWFORD.
Among the policemen who responded J
to the "hurry call" telephoned from j
Kearny and Jackson streets to the j
Central station was Bailiff Hickey, and
he it was who pressed the prosecution J
of Miss Hazel Kay, in whose veins ;
surged the unadulterated blood of the |
rapidly disappearing Digger tribe of j
aborigines. She was charged with dis- \
turbing the peace, but Bailiff Hickey j
informed Judge Mogan that the !
formal comnlaint fell far short of con- i
vcying a comprehensive Idea of her
conduct, as his testimony wÂ° ul( l show.
And his testimony did show that a life
time spent amid civilizing influences
had failed to eradicate the defendant's
inherent savagery.
Miss Kay was born in Southern Ore
gon twenty-two years ago, and in
babyhood was adopted by a childless
farmer and his "wife, who reared her as
carefully as if she had been their nat
ural offspring. When her education
was completed, about a year ago, she
went to visit a former schoolmate at
Santa Rosa and remained there until
last week, when she came to San Fran
cisco and took up residence in a lodg
ing-house at S29 Kearny street. That's
where she was arrested for disorderly
behavior, inspired by overindulgence in
fire-water.
A single policeman first attempted to
remove the child of revived nature, but
she fought him so fiercely with tooth
and nail that he was compelled to sum
mon the aid of a bro.ther officer. She
made the task of two no easier than
the effort of one,- and a passing patrol
man contributed his assistance to the
work of subjugation. The trio strug
gled until forced to acknowledge Itself
numerically inadequate, and then, in
despair, the "hurry call" was dis
patched and Bailiff Hickey entered the
lists. When he arrived at the scene of
conflict, the court was blushingly In
formed, Miss Kay's toilet was consid
erably disarranged, and his first act
was to cover her with a gayly striped
horse blanket taken from the patrol
wagon, the mantle making her appear
truly squawish. His strength turned
the odds against the prisoner, but she
never ceased battling until placed In a
cell. And then she made night in the
prison more than usually hideous by
alternating warwhoops and wails of
distress. X y ; : -
Miss Kay had no defense to offer, nor
did she seem to appreciate the repre
hensibility of her conduct. Her rotund
face was divided by a grin as the de
tails of her law defiance were recount
ed, and she almost laughed outright
when the Judge asked her if she were
not ashamed of herself. Why she came
to San Francisco or what prompted her
to Imbibe to excess she either would
not or could not explain. She will be
sentenced to-day.
Charles Dox, the tall comedian of
"The Runaways" company, who as
saulted a newspaper photographer on
the stage of the California Theater, was
fined $10 by Judge Conlan. Miss Daisy
Dale, the sojubrette in the case, failed
to appear, and an eager world may for
ever remain ignorant of why her stage
companions sent for a reporter instead
of a doctor whenever she deemed It
expedient to give a realistic Imitation
of a lady swooning.
â¢ â¢ â¢ /
Mrs. Ellen Callahan. who was fined
$20 by Judge Mogan for selling liquor
without license, , had eluded no less
than three bench warrants before
she was captured. A similar accusa
tion Is registered opposite her name
on Judge Fritz's calendar, and in the
court of * udge Cabanlss she is to be
tried on The charge of stealing an
election booth. She has succeeded in
sidestepping Judge Conlan's" atten
tion, but he retains dread. Her va
rious offenses were committed qp the
2900 block of Clement street, where
she operates a grocery.

Joseph Stone and Frank Scott,
able-bodied street beggars, were given
thirty days apiece by Judge Fritz,
who declared intention to visit the
extreme penalty on every healthy
mendicant that Is brought before him
this month.
"For," quoth his Honor, "the
Christmas shoppers must be protected
from imposition by professional vag
abonds Â»ho seek to take . advantage
of the spirit of giving."
John Driscoll, opium slave, invited
Judsre Mogan to accompany him on a
mushroom-gathering tour of Ports
mouth square.
"The best time to get 'em, Judge,"
said Driscoll. with Intense earnestness,
"is about 4 ' o'clock in the afternoon.
We can fill a big basket in five min
utes. They grow so thickly that you
can't avoid mashing 'em with your
feet. Name your day and I'll call
for you."
The policeman testified that he ar
rested Mr. Driscoll for disturbing the
peace by hurling vituperation at an
Invisible thief, who had stolen imag
inary mushrooms from an impercep
tible basket.. The unfortunate fel
low was sentenced to ten days, to his
very great astonishment.

Miss Theresa Hendry's long pro
bation was concluded by Judge Mogan
sentencing her to serve thirty 'days in

capitalist, by demanding redress for a
wronK which she alleged Mr. Whittier
had done to her about fourteen years
ago. Judge Mogan convicted her, but
deferred sentence from time to time,
his evident object being to prevent a
repetition of her disorderly behavior,
until she Insisted on being sentenced
sy that she could appeal to the Su
perior Court and institute a civil suit
for damages against Mr. Whittier.
Her appeal bond was filed and ac
cepted.
Charles Smith, a ship's steward,
â was intoxicated when he went to his
home. 161 Seventh street, at 1 o'clock
yesterday morning, and Mary, his
wife, was so incensed br his condition
that she began to throw his personal
belongings out of window and bit
terly regretted her physical inability
to subject him to similar treatment.
Among the articles thus ejected by
the enragod lady was a knife such as
seamen use, and in its flight it cut a
thin slice off her spouse's right knee,
whereupon he accused her of attempt
to murder and then gave her Into
custody. Mary disproved the charge
and Judge Mogan dismissed the com
plaint.
Benjamin Sachs pleaded that it was
in self-defense he threw the eggs, but
as he was charged with having stolen
the missiles his plea was utterly ig
nored by Judge Conlan, -who pro
nounced him a rank lngrate and will
sentence hinWor petty larceny.
Edward Campion, an army pension
er residing at 1616 Powell street, was
the person from whom the eggs had
been pilfered. His pension was drawn
monthly, and with commendable pru
dence he laid in enough provisions to
keep the wolf from his door for thirty
days ere he indulged in frivolous ex
penditure. Having thus stocked his
larder last Tuesday he happened to
meet Benjamin Sachs, a veteran vaga
bond, and Invited him to partake of
liquid refreshment, which Invitation
was instantly accepted. After escort-
Ing his guest to 1616 Powell street
Mr. Campion took an empty pitcher
and proceeded to a nearby saloon to
purchase beer, and during his ab
sence Mr. Sachs abstracted from the
larder two dozen eggs, two rolls of
butter and one bottle of Worcester
shire sauce. Some small boys who
saw him emerge from the door in
stantly divined that he had stolen his
freight and when they attempted to
relieve him of it he placed his back
against a wall and began bombarding
them with the eggs. Police Sergeant
Christiansen's attention was attracted
by the tumult, but he discreetly ab
stained from intervening until he was
satisfied that Mr. Sachs had exhausted
his ammunition. Then he arrested
him. The butter, It may not be amiss
to add, went the way of the eggs, but
the greater portion of It was scraped
from the clothing of two small boys
and restored to Mr. Campion. With
the epgs Mr. Sachs scored nineteen
out of the twenty-four possible hits.
The sauce bottle was broken and its
contents lost forever.
James F. Mathews proudly pro
claimed himself the sole survivor .of
the once mighty army of opium smok
ers.
"That's nonsensical, but, consider
ing the source, not surprising," said
Judge Mogan. "The police say that
the number of 'dope fiends' in this
city is larger than It ever was."
"Ah, but I'm . de only one of de
whole bunch dat has stuck to de long
draw," Mr. Mathews elucidated. "All
de udder hopheads have switched to
de hypo, but de pipe's good enough
for me."
* Mr. Mathews will be sentenced for
vagrancy. j

ROADS PROJECT
Business Men at Gathering
at the St. Francis Hotel
Approve of .Ashe's Ideas
NEW ACT EXPLAINED
Advantages to Be Gained by
. the Bro wnlow . Bill Are
Shown to the Assemblage
"San Francisco will lend its support
to the 'good roads' movement." That
was the sentiment expressed by a
gathering of prominent business men
at the San Francisco Hotel yesterday.
The- meeting was short, but not lack
ing in earnestness and enthusiasm.
W. L. Ashe. formerly' Commissioner
of Highways, acted as chairman and
Louis Hirsh was elected secretary.
Ashe, who was a member of the roads
committee that met in Sonoma County
a short time ago, outlined the purpdse
of the meeting clearly and tersely.
He explained that the Sonoma com
mittee had looked into the subject
thoroughly and had based their ideas
on bills which had passed the Legisla
ture, but were vetoed by Governor
Gage. They had framed their sugges
tions to comply with the Brownlow
biil. now pending in Congress.
This bill makes an appropriation of
524,000,000 to be distributed among
the States according to their popula
tion, California to get about $480,000,
providing she complies with the re
quirements of the act. The bill pro
vides that the National Government
furnish one-half of the expenses and
the State or civil subdivision thereof
making application for the co-opera
tion shall furnish the remainder of
the money expended in the road work.
Every State or subdivision having ac
cepted such national aid must bind
itself to keep said roads in good and
efficient repair for the use of the pub
lic.
Mr. Ashe also explained that
any State that did not avail itself of
the money appropriated in this act
prior to January 1, 1907, would for
feit its right to secure it. The money
so forfeited is to be apportioned among
the other States.
Ashe urged that a change in the.
State's road laws was necessary. He
proposed the following classification
of highways: (1) Roads designated by
the Supervisors of the different coun
ties as main county roads. These are
to be constructed by the county and
the State is to keep them in repair,
whether they are built with or without
the help of the national Government.
(2) The remaining roads are to be
designated as district or neighborhood
reads and are to be built and main
tained by a district tax.
Highway Commissioner John R.
Price gave some valuable advice on
the movement. The plans suggested
by the Sonoma convention were unani
mously indorsed and it was moved to
ask the members of the. Legislature
from San Francisco to support bills in
line with these Ideas.
Following are some who are Inter
ested in the movement:

SHARP RETORTS
MARK WILL CASE
Attorney Collins for Propo
nents Objects to Efforts
to Coach Two Witnesses
YOUNG WIFE OX STAND
Yiolet, Monnier Tells of At
tempt to Convince . Her
That Marriage Was Void
The proceedings of the Monnier will
contest in Judge Graham's court were
marked yesterday by several sharp
passages between the attornevs. On
several occasions George D. Collins, for
the defense, objected to the attempts of
Theodore J. Roche, for the contestant,
to lead on and coach the witness. Be
fore the adjournment of the morning
and afternoon sessions Collins objected
to the delays necessitated by the ab
sence of witnesses for the contestant,
and asked that the Question of the le
gality of the junior Monnier's adoption,
whfch is now pending, be j heard and
disposed of.
Mrs. Monnier Jr. was the principal
witness yesterday, but she was on the
stand for only half an hour. She told
of the times she met George Monnier
and described their courtship and mar
riage. She said that the marriage was
without the consent of the Monnlers,
but that her fathfer and mother gave
their consent.* /
Mrs. Monnier Jr. then said that the
day after her marriage Mrs. Monnier
Sr. called on her and declared that the
marriage was illegal and that she was
rot George Monnier's wife. At an In
terview several days later, at which
Mr. Monnier . was present but took no
part, Violet Monnier declared that Mrs.
Monnier became abusive and made her
cry. A third person came into the
room, and Mrs. Monnier intentionally
introduced her to him as Miss Henry,
her maiden name.
Mrs. Monnier Sr. at the time told Vio
let Monnier that If she would visit a
certain lawyer's office she would be
shown that there had been no legal
marriage. A visit was made, but the
witness had no talk with the attorney.
Later she met him with her husband
and they visited a restaurant, where
champagne was opened in celebration
of the marriage.
A visit wag made by the couDle to
the home of the Monniers, with the ob
ject of persuading Monnier Sr. to for
give them. .The witness said that on
this occasion Mrs. Monnier became so
angry and noisy that both she and her
husband were In tears and that Mon
nier distractedly put' his hands to his
head and left the room. ,
Minnie Mugge, formerly employed
by the Monnlers, testified that although
the wine cellar of the-" Monniers was
well stocked there was no beer, and
that Mrs. Monnier Sr. sent the hired
man out every day for a pall of beer,
which she afterward bottled and kept.
The case will go on to-day at 10 o'clock.

THE END OF THE FAIR^
THE great St. Louis Exposition is over. The g^tes are closed.
The dream city that cost millions will melt away and leave not
a wrack behind. It was devised to celebrate one of the greatest
events in history, one that changed the course of nations, affected
their development and growth and impressed their career. Withouc
the Louisiana purchase the United States would never have crossed
the Mississippi River, and would have had no Pacific- Coast. Where
now American States flourish with millions of people, speaking the
same language, united in the same destiny, inspired by the same
genius and dwelling in freedom under the same institutions, another
riag would flutter, another language be spoken and narrower insti
tutions would hamper the development of man.
It was a great event and the St. Louis Exposition has greatly
celebrated it. Considered in its own line and type, that exposition
has been of such noble proportions and measure as to deserve to
stand, as it will, alone among the efforts of man to assemble in one
place the material achievements of the world. These expositions of
the arts and crafts and sciences of the world began in London in
1 85 1 , and have recurred at stated periods until now. The United
States has been the promoter of fÂ«">ur. one in the Crystal Palace in
New York, the Centennial at Philadelphia, the Columbian at Chi
cago and this greatest of them all at St.* Louis.
It was not merely the greatest of the American expositions, but
the greatest the world has seen. As it cannot be excelled, it. is prob
able that it will be the last on a grand scale. St. Lonls planned it
open-eyed to the fact that it would not pay in money. Its cost was
so colossal that admissions and fees on a scale to' meet it would have
been prohibitory! That city unselfishly assumed the task of dis
playing the industrial, artistic, moral and scientific condition of the
world at the beginning of the twentieth century without regard to
the return in money. The aim of the projectors was to. have the
greatest exposition in history and it was attained. The educative
effect will long be felt as the. impulse of the industries of every na
tion. In millions of memories and notebooks are treasured the les
son. Emulation was stimulated, methods reformed and skill and
ambition spurred among the people of the world. In material things
the nations learned to more sincerely respect each other." Barriers
were broken down and strangers fellowshipped each other on a scale
not known before. Nor did the lesson stop with the materialities and
dynamics of the world. In the international congresses held there
the moral and scientific forces of the globe met in grand council, and
learning and letters displayed their ineffable treasures for the welfare
and enlightenment of man. It was in this sense and meaning of the
term that St. Louis determined "to make the exposition pay, and
there is no room for doubt that in these ways it was the best paying
enterprise ever planned and undertaken by man.
The martial conquests of Xapoleon have all lapsed. The na
tions to which he gave kings, and the peoples whose government
he changed like a garment, know no more of the authority he es
tablished with the sword. The political geography of Europe re
tains no frontier that he fixed. Xo dynasty that he enthroned sits
among the kings. It all rose like a mirage, and glittered and van
ished and is not. Pilgrims look upon his gorgeous tomb in the In
valides and are thrilled that behind the gilt lies the dust in which
once flitted the dream of universal empire that before. him had in
spired Alexander and Caesar. But in all the world there is no ves
tige left of his attempt and theirs to crystallize that vision of glory.
"The wind has blown it all away. Where are the dreams of yes
terday?" _-j.j*t . . : i^;:l
Yet the fame and glory of Napoleon were written large where
he never expected them to be remembered and in a land that he never
saw. When he offered Louisiana to the United States and to liberty,
in exchange for the gold that equipped his army for Austerlitz,' he
touched the key that opened the world's exposition at St. Louis. He
gave power and dominion to the republic : he poured the blessing of
self-government like a shower of gold upon millions to be and
transformed a struggling nation and gave it the hegemony of a hem-
When President Francis closed the Exposition with a gesture of
benediction over the pearl white palaces, and the pathetic quotation.
"Farewell, a long farewell to all thy greatness," he uttered only the
threnody of the bright scene* that had sheltered man's testimony to
his skill and power. The. real greatness will not depart. Its effect
will be as permanent as the aspirations of the race. .â f
CHINESE IMMIGRATION.
IT is easy to believe that the new Chinese exclusion treaty which is
being negotiated at Washington between Secretary Hay And Sir
Chentung Liang-Cheng is attended with very considerable diffi
culties. The double object of the new treaty is to still further safe
guard the United States against the flood of Chinese immigration,
and at the same time to mitigate the supposed indignities which
Chinamen of the better class are compelled to undergo upon arrival
at American ports. ;â¢ : ~<'<
There is of course no cruel or vindictive feeling in America upon
the subject of Chinese immigration. There is at the same time a
determination as strong as it ever was to resist any . relaxation of
vigilance in the matter of Chinese exclusion, and this is perfectly
compatible with a heart}- desire to extend every courtesy to reputable
visitors from all parts of the world. Xo one understands the prob
lem more thoroughly than Secretary Hay, and we may rest assured
that neither the interests of the country nor its deserved reputation
for hospitality will suffer at his hands, or as a result of the negotia
tions which he is now conducting with the Chinese Minister. .
THE ADULTERATION OF DRUGS.
THE experiment which has been carried out b'y the Illinois State
Board of Pharmacy haf* produced a serious and disquieting re
sult. One hundred" and thirty-nine .tfial prescriptions were sent
for preparation to a like number of druggists, and the returns upon
analysis showed that twenty-three contained no trace whatever of
the drug demanded, eighty-five contained impurities ranging in vol
ume from 10 to 80 per cent, and only thirty-one were accurately pre
pared. Small wonder that Chicago physicians have marveled $t the
apparent non-efficacy of the remedies they prescribed.
The adulteration^ of drugs is an offense far more serious even
than the adulteration of food, and it may be that a practice so perni
cious and so conscienceless will receive a much needed check by, the
prosecutions which are to be undertaken against one hundred of the
offending pharmacists. Even if they were themselves misled by dis
honest salesmen, a lesson in caution will be advantageous to them
as it will unquestionably be to the community at large.

half way up a stepladder, could only
s<hake her head in declination.
"Tell her I'm ever so much obliged,
Jimmie, but It's impossible."
"Hold on. Jim!" called his father.
"I'm not so sure of that, Minna. You're
tired out. Your old nervous headache
will come back if you keep on fussing
around the house. The rest of these
pictures can wait- Or Bert will help
me."
He looked interrogatively at the
ycung man stretched out in a low rat
tan steamer chair, a magazine in one
hand and a cigarette in the other.
"To be sure I will!" he answered
heartily. "Go on, Minna! The drive
will do you good."
Little Mrs. Barrows, .plump, dim
pled and black-eyed, held up a positive
forefinger. Â».-â 
VI don't go without Henry," she de
clared. "If any one needs' an outing
it's this poor fellow, who is tied to a
stool behind a brass railing six days
out of seven."
"Like 'bird in a gilded cage!'." sang
Herbert Barrows gayly.
Minna' Barrows looked affectionately
at. her husband. "Precisely:" Come
or, Henry! I'll be ready in a flash -if
you'll come too!"_ 9*'
The stepladder . groaned as the big
man stepped down.
"You're an awful tyrant, Minna!"
He gave her a caressing pat on the
shoulder as he passed. "But we wHl
knock off work if you say so."
The two, freshly groomed and cris'ply
clad, looked in on Herbert to say a
word of adieu before joining their
friend. .'.'â :Â£â &
"Don't let any one steal you," ad
vised Henry Barrows. \ <
"I won't," he laughed back. "Hand
some men are scarce."
"Conceited monster!" cried his sister
in-law, and made a feint of throwing
her parasol a; him- r 0Â» X;
"You better hurry!" counseled Jim
my, aged six. "Mrs. Brentley's horsts'll
get tired waiting. Don't bother about
Uncle Bert. Aunt Vivia will take care
of him."
Herbert Barrows sat suddenly erect.
"Vivia!" he repeated. "Are you ex
pecting Vivia? You did not say any
thing about it."
Husband and wife exchanged a guilty
glance.
"Well, we knew that you and Vivia
were not the best of. friends in the
world," Mrs. Barrows began, falter
ingly.
"I'll go up town on the 3:30 train,"
decided Herbert. His clean-cut, clean
shaven young face looked tremendously
determined. He had gone oddly pale
under his coppery tan. "She. doesn't get
here until 7, I suppose?"
"She didn't say what train she'd take
down," answered Henry Burrows, "but
you're an awful idiot, if you let a slip
of a girl like Vivia frighten you away.
If I'd been so easily Intimidated,"
glancing fondly at his wife, "I.'d never
have won this little woman here."
Herbert sprang up, tall, nervous, ath
letic, his hands thrust in his pockets.
"It's altogether different. Minna nev
er 'threw you over. Vivia has 1 broken
off our engagement. It would be em
barrassing for her to find me here." .

flicker of amusement coming into her
eyes.
"Don't you worry about Vivia," she
advised.
"I wish she'd worry a bit about me,"
remarked Herbert gloomily. "But she
won't. She. doesn't care a snap for me,
or she'd have given me a chance to ex
plainâ"
Jimmie gave a summoning howl from
the hall.
]"Say, Mrs. Brentley'll drive oft an*

on you." *â¢ - â¢'â¢-. â¢ "y
The laggards, with a fusillade of good
advice directed toward Herbert, took
their hurried departure, but that young
gentleman had already pulled a time
table from his pocket and was studying
it in much despondency of spirit. A
whoop from his-'effervescent nephew
startled him.
"Look, Uncle Bert, what I found!" A
battered horseshoe was held triumph
antly aloft in a grimy little hand.
"That's for good luck, every time. Nail
it u? over the door, will you? Mam
ma'll be awful glad to have It there.
Khe bad one nailed up In our house
in' town. Here's the hammer."
"Herbert Barrows, the -friend of chil
dren In general and of this small
nephew in particular, rose obediently.
i "Look out for those pictures!" cau
tioned Jimmy.
. They were ranged along th$ wall
preparatory to hanging etchings,
passepartouts, aquarellas and one long
Venetian mirror. ,
"Jimmy," sighed the uncle of that
estimable small boy. "if your advice
were only as valuable as it is frequent
what an admirable young person
you'd be to have for a constant com
panion. Hallo!-. Great Scott! Look
out there!"
Too late! Leaning forward from
the stepladder to fasten the horse
shoe in the direct center of the cas
ing over the door, the liutter of a blue
gown on the porch had caught his
eye. And as the wearer stepped
lightly over the threshold the nerv
ousness engendered by'his sudden rec
ognition caused the bit of battered
iron to fly from his fingers. ' For one
horrified instant he hardly dared
look. Then he saw it had only grazed
the arm of the girl entering and, de
flecting, had crashed into the gleam
ing recesses of the Venetian mirror.
'Oh, what bad luck!" she cried, re
garding the shattered fragments.
"But my horseshoe would have
.brought good luck, Aunt Vivia, if he
hadn't let it fall," protested Jimmy in
dignantly.
"I'm so sorry," apologized Herbert
in a low voice. : "I was unpardonably
awkward.
The girl, exquisitely attired, young
a/id graceful, glanced from one to the
other, then at the broken looking
glass. She sank down on a rattan di
van and burst into helpless laughter.
"It's too absurd. The idea of break
ing a mirror with a horseshoe. What
a^ combinations good and bad luck."
For the time being she had forgot
ten the peculiarity of her present re
lations with the culprit.
"It's all his fauit," sturdily insisted
Jimmy, picking up. his treasured pos
session. "My, won't mamma give it
to you, Uncle Bert, .when nh* flnris out
you've broken MiEsSibley's mirror."

"Yes^lrist; Christmas. -Why, Aunt

-"Oh. â nothing!" returned Vivia
Grant.
A strange, swift suspicion shot
through the mind of Herbert Bar
rows. He leaned forward eagerly.
Thoughts, recollections, were crowd
ing up in bÂ«wlldering succession.
"Vivia â tell me!" he half pleaded â
half commanded. "Was it because of
mi'-rmy attention, to -Miss Sibley at
the commencement - dance that you
sent me back my ring? Frank Len
nard. was away that .night and he
feared Laura would feel lonely. So,
a3,we both had belonged to the same
fraternity â 'â  â "
"Frank Lennard!" Vivia exclaimed.
"You don't mean to say â 'r-''.-.
"Why, of course! I suppose you
knew they are to be married, In Oc

hurt?"
A thin red line showed through the
pale, transparent stuff of her sleeve.
Ho had pushed the material up in an
instant and was binding the slight
wound by his handkercheif.
"It's only a scratch; Bert!" She was
laughing â a trifle hysterically. "We've
â we've both been â at least I've
been â awfully foolish!"
"Jimmy," said Barrows, "I'll give
you 50 cents If you'll take /that broken
glass out and throw it hvthe ditch."
"Betcher life!" responded Jimmy.
He loaded a basket and started off.
"To think that a broken mirror
should bringâ â " the girl, was saying.
"Hello, \ Jimmy! < Back - so soon?
Here's your half!" Herbert dipped the
one hand at liberty, into his pocket.
He brought" out a 'dollar/ 1 "Say." he
bargained. "I'll give you all of this if
you stay out and watchâ sentry fash-
Ionâ like a soldier, you know, that no
one takes that glass out of the ditch!"
"Will I?" replied Jimmy. "Put it
here. I knew, my horseshoe would
bring me luck!"
The face against Herbert's shoul
der was- jifted mischievously.
. ."It. is brood luck, Bert?" she ques
tioned quizzically.
"The best in the world," he de-
emphatically. .. He. . concluded
his sentence with a-^oyer's period.

back over. his shoulder. '.'Gee!"

YEARS OF DISCRETION
IN CONNECTION WITH
MATRIMONIAL STEP
BY DOROTHY FENIMORE
I 1 NDER modern conditions n\rst
/ I love is usually nothing more than
.^J an educational experience. The
time is past when a young cou
ple of ordinary fortune can safely
begin married life with a simple pro
vision for the present and a faith . in
the future. So that first love, which
in luckier days implied marriage, now
implies itself merely. It is looked upon
ar an ephemeral passion, butterfly
hued, and light on the wing.
Recently the clerk of the marriage
license bureau made the Interesting
statement that for the last twenty-two
years the average age of marriage has
not varied from 25 years for man and
24 years for woman. While the actual
number of licenses taken out by the
very young and by the very old has
Increased with the growth of the popu
lation, the proportion has not changed
enough to Affect statistics appreciably*
â  "This general postponement of mar
riage until maturity means, without
doubt, many heartaches for early
youth. Boys and girls fall in love with
rach other without regard to the out
come â or to the Income, for that mat
ter. Sometimes they defy common
sense and marry on nothing a year, to
their ultimate regret. But more often
they fall out of love as naturally and
as comfortably as they fell in. And
each puts to good use in succeeding
love affairs the knowledge gained from
the first experiment.
, At, the beginning of the twentieth
century^ when ; bread costs, what cake,
used to, and turkey is to many a city
hcusehold . an unsubstantial holiday
dream, marriage is the wildest extrav
agance of which youth In its teens is
capable, unless It can go right on liv
ing 'at. home with papa. The license
and the ring. are the cheapest part of
it,'; even when they do take all your
pocket money.
A boy is not qualified to take care
of V wife. He is hardly competent to
take care of himself. When starting
out in business life he has need, for
his own use, of all the resources at
his command. A wife and family are
no, help to him; they keep him depend
ent by cutting off that freedom of
choice in work which is likely to open
for him the road to success..
Then his tastes are not yet formed.
His judgment is not firm enough."' He
is -not ready to take his place among
men as the head of a household and
the, father -of a family. When married
he. is still a boy and one who Is enter
ing manhood with a heavy handicap.
And. the girl who marries early is
robbing herself of one-half of the zast
ot" life. She is making a short hurdle
race: out of girlhood, courtship and
marriage.
Is the game worth the candle?
. I say that any stake is too great
when it is your happiness. And that
is what you jeopardize when you take
so madly your matrimonial fences.
But first love as an educational ex
perience is .distinctly worth while for
either sex- It is a course of training
which is of general utility. It is as
good as a year at military school to
teach a young fellow to hold up his
head.
It Is a pleasant and inexpensive kind
of beauty culture for young women. It
develops both sexes intellectually, emo
tionally, morally. And It gives y them
an artistic ''sense of perspective and
chiaroscuro. .
No, I have listened respectfully to
all; the weighty remarks that clerical
gentleman have made In favor of early
marriages' and " have not been con
vinced, invspite of my receptive atti
tude. Without question marriage is a
lottery. Even those who have drawn
prizes are willing to admit this fact.
And I do not believe that before years
of discretion' come the exhilaration of
the risk warrants one's taking it.

OF THE GAME LAWS.
Editor The Call: Being a moun

a family, I should like to say a few
words for the old man. the boy and
the people that own the â¢ land that
raises the game. I have never seen
anything In favor of them, or. rather.
I think those that make the game
laws never consider the ones that
raise the game. A writer in The
Call says: "When the law went into
force that the quail should not be sold
there* was : a gr,eat cry, but still we
live, and the rich buy something else,
and we are just as well ofT."
But he did not mention what the
old man suffered from the loss of
wiann clothing, or the boy that went
barefooted through the winter.
Neither. did he say. anything about
the way the deer keep the orchards
and vineyard* back by eating them
off. When your orchards come Into
bearing, your prunes are picked.

strings were freely untied made the
rounds of the handsomely laden booths

book booth contained literary gems and
there was a rush for literature. Fancy

Santa Rosa. Dec 4.HANDSOME SOUVENIRS FOR
"KING DODO" AUDIENCE
Press (Â£lus gnow . To-Qight
The rood luck that Is supposed to be
inspired by the presence of the prover
bial black cat will undoubtedly be
brought Into play to-night by the sleek
rr.ascot of the Press Club, "Toomey" â
or more correctly. Tombstone Second.
*'Toomey" will be at the production of
"King Dodo" at the TIvoII Opera-house,
even If he has to be carried there in a
basket. He has not left the Press Club
rooms on Ellis street since the last en
tertainment, at Fischer's Theater, one
year ago, but to-night he will be there
with all four feet when the curtain
rises for an encore.
There are a few seats left for the
Prefs Club benefit, but not very many.
President Holliway said last night that
he did not think that there would be a
vacant chair in the house when the
play starts. "And," he added. "I would
like to call attention to the souvenir
programme, which alone is worth the
price of admission."
The programme Is in colors, the
frontispiece being a splendid specimen
of artistic taste," which was executed
by Artist Haig Patigian. There are
About twenty-flve Illustrated short
stories, poems and sketches by news,
paper men. The art work Is by mem
bers of the newspaper art staffs of the
local press.
To miss the Press Club arrangement
cf "King Dodo" would be to miss a
treat.

BENEFIT THIS EVENING
THIRTY NAMES
FOR GRAND JURY
Prominent Witness the
Drawing and Offer Sugges
tions to Test Regularity
At noon yesterday In Presiding Judge
Kerrigan's courtroom County Clerk
John Greif drew the names of thirty
citizens from the Grand Jury box, and
from this list nineteen grand Jurors
will be chosen next Saturday morning
at 11 o'clock-
Yesterday's ceremony was attended
by Frank J. Symmes. president of the
Merchants' Association; Fairfax Whee
lan, who recently undertook the prose
cution of ballot-box stuffers, and As
sistant District Attorney Ferral. The
gentlemen showed a close interest in
the proceedings and offered a sugges
tion or two which, to their mind, would
add to the certainty of the regularity
of the drawing. They inspected the
seal placed on the tin cylinder by Judge
Kerrigan after the drawing of the
names for the Jury last June. They
were shown the slips bearing the names
of the eleven men excused at that time
and these slips, which have been in
Judge Kerrlfiran's custody, were re
turned to th'e box.
The interested spectators were then
informed that there were 125 names in
the box, and Mr. Symmes asked if the
court felt certain that none were miss
ing. The Presiding Judge replied in the
affirmative, . but to gratify the gentle
men he directed that the slips be
counted. They were dumped upon the
desKT^nd as Mr. Greif j-eturned them
one by one to the cylinder Court Clerk
John Riley kept tally. There were 125.
The draw then proceeded, with the
following result:

OLD PIONEER
DIES ABROAD
News Is Keceived in This
City of the Passing
Away of John Van Bergen
LEAVES LAEGE ESTATE
His Business, Established
Many Years Ago, Is Still
Being Eun Successfully
'News was received in this city yes
terday of the 'death of ; John J. Van
Bergen,, a former pioneer of this city,
who for many years had. been living in
Germany. <*>-? -^V ' .
Mr. Van Bergen is well remembered
by the old-timers. He came around the
Horn in his own ship with his father in
1849 and settled in San Francisco. Fore
seeing a great future for the village,
he and a friend started in the liquor
business' bn"\VashIngton street under
the firm name of Schaefer & Van Ber
gen. Later Van Bergen conducted the
business alone. He was also. interested
in the old Bay Sugar Refinery.
Mr. "Van Bergen established the liquor
house now under the name of N. Van
Bergen & Co. Originally . it was con
ducted under his own name, but later
he sold out to his brother," and the
house is still running under the broth
er's name. '. 'â¢
In 1S63 Mr. Van Bergen's health was
impaired by a sunstroke while he was
in the Sacramento Valley, and her went
to Germany. Since then he has spent
much of his time abroad. He made
his last trip from this city to Germany
in 1891.
Mr. Van Bergen was 86 years of age.
A widow and seven children survive
him. One son. Henry, resides in this
city, another Is in New, York and the
rest of the family Is In Germany. He
leaves an estate said to be worth $1,
000,000.

A commission that was sent here
some months ago to investigate the
feasability of having an underground

favorably. It was recommended by
the commission-that a tube should be
constructed from the foot of Market

Seventh and Mission; als'o a tube from
Mission and New Montgomery streets,
postofflce station K, to the railroad

Members of Organization to
Abandon Boycott Pending
Hearing of Firm's Action
The F. A. Swain Company was boy
cctted on October ' 3 by the Bakery
and. Confectionery Workers' Interna
tional'Unlon, Local Nol"24,and yester
day^ resenting the attempts of the or
ganization to impede its business and
intimidate Its employes,'- the 'firm ap
plied to the Superior Court for an in
junction. Judge Hebbard issued a
temporary order restraining the union
men from continuing the acts com
plained of pending the trial of the
case. â  .. .
Swain's bakery is at 209 Post street.
On October 2, it is alleged, represen
tatives of the defendant union, accom
panied by a committee from the union
of Salesmen of Bakery Goods, called
on the management ana demanded the
discharge of three delivery, drivers,
who had been expelled from {he sales
men's organization. The three men
were giving perfectly -satisfactory ser
vice and the firm declined to comply.
Next day. the boycott was declared and
the union "men were ordered^ to strike.
Since then, it is alleged, union- rep
resentatives and pickets have congre
gated at the place of business and have
sought to force the Â»non-unlon em
ployes to quit their employment by
threats of bodily harm. One of the
phrases attributed j to - them is:
"If -you donot quit this Job we will
beat your brains out." Besides way
laying non-union men, the pickets are
charged with frightening customers
and having already damaged the
plaintiff's business to the amount of

MARQUIS OF QUEENSBERRY RULES FOR BRITT AND NELSON
BOXERS AGREE
ON THE RULES
Britt and Xdson to Break
at Keferee's Order and
Then Protect Themselves
CONFERENCE IS BRIEF
When Subject Is Broached
Both Sides Admit That
a Rumor Had 3Iisled Them
When Teddy Murphy and Jimmy
Britt met late yesterday afternoon at
the ocean beach they came to terms
Quickly regarding the way Britt and
Nelson are to fight in the clinches.
Alter five minutes' discussion, each
agreed that the boxers will break at
the order of the referee and will pro
tect themselves in the breakaways.
Brltt admitted he had been misled re
cardlng Murphy'B idea of breaking and
Murphy said he perceived that come
cn e was handing him a bunch of con
versation when he was informed that
Britt insisted on a so-called "clean
Lx'eak."
Murphy had heard from some alert
taihrrer of information that Britt in
riÂ«=u-d upon a "clean break. 1 one that
would compel both lads to stick their
arms heavenward and back away with
out even indulging in wrist taps. Some
xvlsfe person informed Britt that Nelson
insisted upon wrestling and twisting
-ut of every clinch and keeping this up
till one or the other should be sub-
d *Tonsequently each had a -'complaint.
Britt said he would not think of ac
commodating Mr. Murphy, and Murphy
on the other hand said he would ad
vise his charge to committ suicide be-
Jo" he would let him tight Britt on a
clean break layout. Both averred they
Tvould stand strictly by their word.
It was all different when the meet
ing took place. Britt and Murphy air
ed th*ir differences and after a short
discussion it was agreed by both that
the boxers break by order of the ref
eree ard protect themselves in the
breakaways.
â¢The chap who was the author of
these rules is long since dead." said
Britt. "and I do not think any of us
have a right to change them at this
â¢â¢Neither do I," chimed in Murphy.
"but I won't stand for a clean break at
that. I would rather let Nelson lie
down or commit suicide than permit
him to fight you under such condi
tions."
"Well, what do you mean by that?"
*aid Britt. "1 will give you an illustra
tion of a clean break." With this,
Jimmy arose and stuck both hands up
in the air and did a sort of double
Britt admitted that he never
demanded anything like that and was
witistied to fight Nelson just as he had
fought his various opponents. Murphy
assorted his willingness and the af
fair was settled without further parley.
They will fight under the same condi
tions as did Nelson and Young Cor
bett.
The conference took place at the Seal
Kock House, where Britt is preparing
himself for the coming battle. Besides
Murphy and Britt. Harry Corbett,
Billy Roche and Manager Jim Coffroth
were present at the conference. All
were somewhat worried over the as
pect and were anxious to see Just what
was about to come off. The forfeits
will be posted to-day with Harry Cor
bett.
Britt looks lit and ready to enter the
ring at a moment's notice. But for all
that h* is working Just as though he
veighed 200 pounds. He entertained a
large collection of sports and a few
]?dies at his select gymnasium yester
day afternoon and all felt gratified at
the showing. Britt said he weighed
104*s pounds.
The punching bag came in for a few
raps, though Jimmy soon quit that
â¢when he discovered the stand was rick
ety and needed bracing. He started in
to" give Frank Rafael a good time for
four rounds, setting a fast pace and
winging in the body punches in quick
succession. In fact, James went so
fa*t that some thought they were look
ing at a real fipht instead of only a
training camp sham battle.
Britt took on Charley Kreling for one
long and tedious round of wrestling
and clinching. This was hard work,
though James seemed to eat it up and
h* worked his partner faster each min
ute. When he finished in the gym
nasium, Brltt took a plunge In the
d^ep. blue sea. came back and ate din
ner p.nd began to think about his next
day's work.
ADVERTISEMENTS.
Have been suffering from Impure Blood
for many years, having Boils and other
Eruptions. Having heard of S. S. S. I de r
ci ded to try it, and am glad to say that it
has done me a great deal of good. I intend
to continue to use it, as I believe it to be
the best Blood Medicine on the market.
Cleveland, Tenn. W. K. Deters.
For over fifteen years I have suffered
more or less from Impure Blood. About a
rear ago I had a boil appear on my leg
below the knee, which was followed by
three pore on my neck. I saw S. S. S.
advertised and decided to try it. After
taking three bottles ell Boils disappeared
end I have not been troubled any since.

From childhood I jhad been bothered
trith bad blood, skin eruptions and boils.
I had boils ranging from five to twenty in
number each season. The burning ac-
companying the eruption was terrible.
S. S. S. seemed to be just the medicine
seeded in my case. It drove out all impu-
rities and bad blood, giving me perma-
nent relief from the skin eruption and
boils. This has been ten years ago, and I
have never had a return of the disease.

DEFEATS GATEWAY FOR THE HANDICAP
Downfall of San Nicolas

Costly for the Talent
BULLMAN PILOTS ARA
Mansard Disposes of a
. Fast Lot of Sprinters.
Toledo J Wins Cleverly
BY FRED E. MULI1OLLAXD.
Ananias, owned by Johnny Schorr
and ridden by "Big Bill" Knapp. led
his field a forlorn chase in the mile
handicap yesterday at Oakland. The
Schorr colt carried 104 pounds, an im
post that fitted him to a "TV â¢
Plunged on at odds of 13 to 10, he
made all the running and won easily
from Gateway, the second choice, in
l:C3$i. JBombardier. was downed with
ease for the show by Vesuvian. Veter
ano, the only other starter, is still shy
of his old time speed.
The attendance was large and the
betting almost as furious as on a holi
day. Favorites annexed three of the
purses.
John Bullman had his first mount at
the meeting in the opening sprint over
the Futurity course for two-year-olds.
He piloted Ara, a 7 to 1 shot, and came
within a short head of defeating the
13 to 20 favorite Golden Buck/ ridden
by Davis. Travers, astride Velna, fin
ished third.
POXAPA WINS CLEVERLY.
Bob Smith's Ponapa, played down
frum S to 3Vs. took the five and a half
furlong run which followed from a big
Held. Sammy Greenfield had the leg
up on Ponapa and passing David Bo
land on the far turn assumed the front
position and at the wire led Harka
over the line a length. The latter filly
closed at 25 to 1. Kunz, on the post
favorite. The Reprobate, only lost th*
place by a nose. "Big Bill" Knapp was
unfortunate in getting away among the
tail-enders with Gallant Cassie.
For an ll-to-10 favorite, Dungannon
assuredly made a splendid showing in
the mile-and-sevent r-yard selling af
fair. At no stag:e of the racing did she
show in better than fifth position, and
finally ended up a poor sixth. Never
theless her stable connections thought
she would win, and the betting had a
healthy appearance. Wonderful to re
late. Flaneur, at 10 to 1. with Frank
Sullivan up. downed old Flying Torpe
do a neck. J. V. Kirby ran an indiffer
ent third.
SAX NICHOLAS IS UXLUCKY.
Dr. Rowell's black horse. San
Nicholas, favorite for the six-furlong
selling feature, in which quite a galaxy
of speed found representation, had his
chances ruined at the start. As the
barrier was sprung he was bumped
and knocked to his knees by Oro Viva
and could not recover the ground then
lost. Sad Sam led almost to the stretch,
where H. I_ Frank, ridden by Me-
Laughlin, headed him. The latter
found the pace too hot and W. Davis
forged to the front with Mansard. In
a mild drive he earned the decision
from Romaine by nearly a length. The
winner's price receded from 4 to 10
to 1.
After her showing in the concluding
seven-furlong purse event, it would
look as if the bruising race run by Ni
grette when she defeated Andrew B.
Cook several days back had dulled the
little mare's speed. Her price was
played down from 4 to 5 to 3 to 5, and
at no time did she look a winner. Hel
gesen, astride Toledo, waited on Whoa
Bill and Ishtar to the stretch, where he
made his move, and at the end won
cleverly. Ishtar, against which 50 to
1 was laid, lost the place to Whoa Bill
by half a lencth.
TRACK XOTES.
W. Davis was the only rider to pi
lot two winners.
Frank Sullivan finally got a move
on and rode a clever race on Flaneur.
Twenty-one books' cut in. Frank
Eckert and the Broadway Club were
the new comers.
N. S. Hand, a well known turfman,
is here from New York. He has two
horses now en route from th.2 J?a3t,
Apple Blossom and Miller'j Daugh
ter. .
The Fretter felt so good after his
winning, race on Tuesday thnt he ran
away five miles with his exercise boy
yesterday morning.

RACING SHELL
FOR BERKELEY
BERKELEY. Dec. 7. â The University
Boat Club officials have received Infor
mation from Cornell that a boat will
leave the Eastern university for Cali
fornia next week. It is a four-oared
coxswain shell, made of Spanish cedar,
and considered a true representation of
the efficiency attained by the most suc
cessful of American racing-boat build
ers.
"I hope the advent of this new boat
will stimulate interest In boat racing
here." said S.' S. Hawley, president' of
the University Boat Club, to-day, "and
that the coming of this boat will be
but the beginning of an Influx of boat
racing material. Our new boat will be
the equal in all respects of the most
perfect shell in the East." :
Preparations are being made at the
university for the inter-class regattas
and candidates for places on the crews
are training for the try-outs to be held
early in the coming term. Among those
who have declared themselves as can
didates are E. A. Bannister, D. M.
Evans, A. Salisbury, G.'. J. Anloff, C-
M. Hurlburt, R. F. Nash, S. S. Haw
ley. E. V. Dodge, H. Bird, H. Schreiber,
J. P. Loeb, E. J. Loeb, Nowell Ross
and George Jones.
Among these candidate? Is R F.
Nash, a sophomore from Wisconsin,
where he acted as coxswain for his
class crew at the State University.
Ezra Decoto, manager of athletics for
the' associated student's, recently called
upon the University of Washington au
thorities to secure the Lippy cup, a
trophy which the California Boat Club
declares should be in Its possession. The
California crew won the last event with
Washington and is entitled to the cup,
according to the conditions of the
donor. The northern authorities have
promised to send .the trophy here at
once. 1
At a meeting of the boat club last
Monday the following officers were
elected for the next half-year: S. S.
Hawley, president; E. A. Bannister,
vice president; A. Salisbury, secretary
and treasurer: D. M. Evans,, corre
sponding secretary.
Athletes of the university who are
devotees of association football are en
deavoring to Introduce the. game here
and eventually to procure the forma
tion of class teams, so . that matches,
may be made without going outside of
the university for opposition. The

CYCLISTS QUIT
SIX-DAY RACE
NEW YORK. Dec. 7.-Angry because
they believed the race was being un
fairly conducted and because methods
which they allege to be wrong allowed
other riders to gain a lap upon them
to-day, five teams in the six-day bicy
cle race at Madison Square Garden, in
cluding some of the best riders com
peting in the event, quit the race. The
flve teams that quit were Walthour and
Munroe, Bedelland Bedell, Mayor and
Newklrk, McLean and Bowler and But
ler and Moran. All of them were among
the best in the contest and among
those most heavily backed to win the
highest prize. â¢
The trouble was precipitated by" the
race thui \ ?* Pe Â« rfOd Â° f rldln * ! " the
race thus far given, when Root and
Dorlon, followed by Stol and Vander
stuyft, succeeded In gaining a lap on
their opponents. Walthour, who acted
as spokesman for the five dissatisfied
teams, declared that, the members of
those teams relieved each other at
times not allowed by the rules, espe
cially in the case of Stol and Vander
stuyft. For two miles Dorlon kept up
a heartbreaking sprint and gained half
a lap on the bunch. Then, hardly los
ing a second, Root jumped In and be
gan a sprint even more heartbreaking
than Dorlon's had been. He kept it up
for forty minutes, with the other riders
trying desperately ,to overtake him, but
at the end of that, time he had gained
the lap he and his partner coveted.
Walthour was on the track through
out the sprint and riding a little ahead
of the. rest. When -Root was making
bis meteoric dash half a; lap ahead of
the rest little Stol. the Belgian rider,
who had Just relieved Vanderstuyft,
stole up. past -Walthour and began a
sprint to catch Root. In twelve laps he
the college. The plan failed' because
there was apparently no one in the
school who knew enough of the pastime
to attempt leadership.
STANFORD LOSES -IiAXIGAK;
Famous Coach . Is ' Unable to Handle
the Cardinal Baseball Nine!
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Dec. 7^
James- Lanagan, Stanford's successful
graduate coach, will not, accept the
position of coach for the baseball
team ; this spring. The loss is a. heavy
one, as Lanagan is as jgreat a baseball
trainer aB he is a football expert and
he had been counted? on to help win
this year's baseball series for Stan
ford.. Pressure of work is Lanagan's
excuse.' The gist of the matter prob r
ably, is that if Lanagan came for base
ball this year, he could not come for
football next, and: so baseball inter
ests were sacrificed for football:\S_Â»H@
It is quite probable that the posi
tion of baseball coach will be given
to. some old Stanford player. . The
idea of graduate coaching in every
line, of .athletics is a - popular one at
Stanford.and so long as" good coaches
can be ;had who are . graduates,.pro
fessional men will not be given posi
tions. . â¢ â¢ v

accomplished what he tried for. Wal
thour was too much taken by surprise
to catch him. 1 'V' ;:
Then the partners in the five teams
named who were not then on the track
made their complaint and declared
their Intention of withdrawing. Their
partners then riding left the track and
all ten riders immediately surrounded
the officials and demanded that the lost
distance be restored to them.
Walthour, as spokesman for the dis
satisfied riders, argued that Stol had
not properly relieved Vanderstuyft and
that the lap was gained unfairly.
P. T. Powers, promoter of the race,
told Walthour and the others that they
had no right to leave the track as they
had done, either by the National Cy
cling rules or. the special contracts
which they made with the manage
ment. He concluded:
"You can go back on the track or not.
Take your choice."
After a conference between President
Batchelder of the National Cycling
Association and R. S. Kelcey, chair
man of the Board of Control of the
association, Walthour and the nine
other- riders who withdrew from the
race were indefinitely suspended.
The case will not be disposed of un
til the regular annual meeting in Feb
ruary. Until that time they cannot
ride on any track In the United States.
Walthour has engaged to ride in Eu
rope in .the early spring, but if the
suspension Is not lifted he will not be
allowed to ride on any track in. th_*
world, nor will any of the other sus
pended men. -
When Manager Pollock ordered the
ten men who had quit the race to leave
the garden a lively argument ensued
and the police reserves were sum
moned. â  The excitement was over
when they arrived.
The garden was thrown into an up
roar, during the trouble, â¢ and at one
time there was a series of fist en
counters air around the oval. Joseph
L. Sullivan, a handler for Keegan, was
given a severe beating.
Mr. Powers later issued orders that
none of the dissatisfied men nor their
trainers nor handlers was to be ad
mitted to the garden again.
Some time later Walthour and Mc-
Lean returned and had a talk with
Powers. Walthour afterward said he
asked Powers for. $600, which he con
sidered due him for the motor-paced
race on Saturday night and his work
so far this week and that Powers had
referred him to an attorney.
. McLean said he "was in the same
boat." ..He. added he had engaged a
lawyer, whom he had Instructed to at
tach the gate receipts at once.
Denial was made by the management
that there had- been any error in the
scorers' box as claimed by the riders
who left the track.
.The two leading teams, Vanderstuyft
and Stol and Root and Dorlon, had
covered 1289 miles 8 laps at 1 o'clock
this morning. No change had occurred
up. to that hour in the relative positions
of the twelve teams. Tne record for
this hour Is 1443 miles 6 laps.
Knocked Down by a Car.

FIVE FAVORITES ARE IN FRONT
Close and Exciting Finishes Mark Racing
at the Ascot Park Course.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 7.â Five favor
ites won at Ascot to-day, while the
winner in the sixth race was a heavily
played second choice. The books,
therefore,- suffered severely and the
betting crowd went home happy. There
were several close and exciting finishes,
but; no particular feature to the day's
sport.'
â  Cloverton, the favorite, won the first
race handily from Sceptre, with Effer
vescence third. Great Mogul was
heavily played, but spoiled his chances
by running away when going to the
post. Fireball was a l-to-2 favorite
for the second race and won all the
way from West Brookfield and Hilona.
The third race was a heavy betting
affair, Elflh King ruling favorite at 6
to 5. He won after a stirring finish
from Bath Beach, with Funny Side
third.
The fourth was easy for Capltanazo.

DECLARES WAR AGAINST
WESTERN JOCKEY OLUB
Edward Corrigan, Backed by New
Orleans Association, Will Settle
Old Scores.
NEW ORLEANS. Dec. 7.â It Is to be
war between the New Orleans Jockey
Club and the Western Jockey Club.
This is the decision 'which the officers
of the former club have reached. The
fight' against the Western association
Is to be led by Edward Corrigan, who
has a number of scores to settle with
the association. He has decided to go
into this thing with heart and soul, and
not only will he have the power of the
New Orleans Jockey Club back of him,
but racing men' here believe he will
throw all other tracks in which he is
interested in the flght and to-night
they are prophesying that the days of
the Western Jockey Club are numbered.
; It. was announced that the New Or
leans Jockey Club would, within a few
days, make application fon membership
in the Western Jockey Club. It is a
foregone conclusion that this request
will be turned down.
The officers of the New Orleans Jock
ey Club will then ask again for an
equitable division of dates. This re
quest will also be refused, according
to the admission of President Samuel
Heisllp. Suit will then be brought in
the Federal courts here to force the
Western Jockey Club to show reason
why the new club was not given a
division of the dates and asking for
forfeiture of the charter of that as
sociation under the claim that its pro
visions have been wantonly violated.
The right promises to become one of
the warmest in turf history in the
West.
CHICAGO, Dec. 7. â The name of
Edward Corrlgan's backer has been
disclosed. The millionaire who of
fered the "Master of Hawthorne" a
fortune to start war with the Western
Jockey Club has been discovered. He
is none other than H. E. Huntington
of New York and San Francisco, the
nephew of the late Collls P. Hunting
ton. That Huntington and Corrigan
will lead a gigantic crusade against
the Western Jockey Club there Is now
no doubt.

INDIANAPOLIS, Dec. 7. â Willie
Fitzgerald of Brooklyn knocked out
Otto Sieloff of qhicago to-night in the
seventh round of what was to have
been a ten-round bout. Four-ounce
gloves were used. It was all Fitzger
ald's flght from the start of the sec
ond round, in which he knocked Sle
loff down twice. From that time
Fitzgerald played with his man to
give the crowd a longer fight, al
though he took a number of wild
swings made by Sleloff and some hard
blows landed on his face, which he
did not seem to mind. The flght was
in. the Auditorium Rink before a large
crowd. A hard left swing on the
head finished the flght.

This report was received at the Mer

SRESOVICH COMPANY ASKS
FOR EXTENSION OP TIME
Wholesale Fruit I>ealers Are Tempo
rarily Embarrassed by Failure
- i of the Apple Crop.
The firm of L.. G. Sresovich Com
pany, commission merchants and
wholesale fruit dealers at 521 San
some street, owes over $20,000 to
creditors throughout the State and an
effort is being made to secure an ex
tension of time in which to meet ob
ligations. A meeting of the creditors
was called Tuesday afternoon, but
nothing definite was accomplished,
the matter being taken under consid
eration. The debt is said to have been
caused by the failure of last year's ap
ple crop.
J. N. Sresovich, secretary of the
company, made this statement yester
day: "We owe $20,000 and we-flnd
that we are unable to pay the debt at
the present time. ' Instead of going
into bankruptcy we would rather ask
for a little time to pay off our cred
itors, dollar for dollar. v For this pur
pose we called the meeting and in a
day or so we will know just what
course Is to be pursued.
"Another thing that contributed to
our misfortune was the fact that our
entire shipment of apples to Austra
lia was cast overboard, it being
claimed that the fruit was affected
either with scale or worm. Now we
have our contracts to meet, but have
received nothing from the products.
If our creditors consent we will set
tle everything inside of a few months
and the firm will continue as before.

REJECTS BIDS FOR THE
PAVING OV H STREET
Board or Works JHvtst Ask for New
Estimates, a* Portion of Work
â¢ Is Already Bone.
The Board of Works yesterday re
jected the bids of the Barber Asphalt'
Company and the City Improvement
Company for the paving of H street,
from Seventh to Twentieth avenues'
It was explained that the award of
contract would be illegal, because tha
City Engineer had not been asked .for
new estimates for the improvement in
view of the fact that about $3000* of
the work had already been done by
the F. M. Yorke Company under its
contract, which was rescinded because
the Supervisors had not granted for
mal authority for the work.
Several contractors explained to the
board that the reason for long delays
in doing street work was due to their
not being able to secure the curbin"
They were instructed not to tear up
streets until the curbing is on the
ground.
The board ordered fences projecting
on the sidewalk line of Buena Vista
avenue to be removed, but decided to
allow projecting steps to remain.
BOXDS REPORTED LOST
ARE NOT IX EXISTENCE
Police Quiet the Tale That North
Shore Securities Are Among
the Mlsslnar.
The reported loss of $10,000 worth
of bonds of the North Shore Railway
has failed to Impress the officials of
the corporation named. After an In
vestigation the police have determined
that not only is the story of the loss to
be questioned, but the existence of the
bends referred to is doubted. The re
sult of the investigation of the police
is best told in the report of Detective
R. J. "Whitaker to Captain of Detec
tives Burnett. > It is as follows:
As requested by you, I called on and Inter
viewed Mrs. McMullen. at 1104 Poat street.
relative to the article published In ths Ex
aminer of this date about her son, George Mc-
Mullen. losing 110,000 worth, of North Shor*
Railway bonds.
Mrs. McMullen stated to me that her son
has not been in New York In eight years; that
he never owned any bonds, stocks or securities
of any description, she having supported him
all his lifetime.
To Force Sale of Land.
On February 19, 1902. the Stauffer
Chemical Company leased half a block
of land at San Bruno avenue and Fif
teenth street from Susanna Lowe and
in the agreement It was provided that
the company should have the privi
lege of buying the property in the
third year . of the lease upon giving
thirty days' notice. Since taking pos
session of the lot a factory for the
making of chemicals and acids has
been built at a cost of (9000 and on
October 7 the firm notified the owner
of its desire to buy. They could not
agree on a price and B. P. Oliver and
P. H. Kenny were selected as arbitra
tors. but> they too failed to agree, nor
could they agree upon a third arbi
trator. Oliver wanted the man chosen
from one of nine leading real estate
firms and Kenny named four persona,
who are said to be relatives or friends
of the Loweg. Yesterday the chemical
company began an action in the Su
perior Court against Mrs. Lowe and
her husband. E. Louis Lowe, to com
pel them to sell the property at a rea
sonable figure. The company is will
ing to pay $20,000 for the land or such
sum as the court may deem just- In
the meantime it demands $5000 for at
torneys' fees and the costs of the suit.

NEW TORK, Dec 7.â To-day's violent
slump in the stock market casie upon the
cssguine speculative element like a bolt from
the bine eky. The fact that runaway bull 1
rsarkets always overrun themselves ntver
:â *..Â» to lessen the surprise of the rpeculators
when the airy fabric crumbles. The fabric
cfuid not. of course, be blown up to Its dla
: â¢ tr. â  â _â¢ 'T.Â«-nn -r.Â» If there were not en
thurlaetic buyers who continue to buy all
stocks offering and to bid up prices In un
bounded confidence that the npm_rd court*
will never b t ictÂ«TUi>ted. Neither would it
be interrupted If Â»r>e*^i!ators were ab> to go
c-a buying indefinitely. But when t_e time
cosies that distrust obtains an entrance to
tbeir consriousr*** and they attempt to sell
their holdings it develops that the buoyant
ri*e has heen due to their cwn buying and
is nothioe left to rnttain prices when
that cease*. Thai Is probably the true ex
planation of the clump to-<_y which took
on fairly panicky proportions at times. But
the crusr.bllBg of price* led to the usual in
dustrious â â¦-orts to âwlgn a cause in some
new development In afTairs that might b* an

It was rot le_med that then* had been any

Future Grain an'd Provisions.
CHICAGO, Dec. 7. â Extreme weakness pre
vailed In the wheat pit from beginning to end
At the rtart May was off, Kc to %c at $L.l2%i
to $1.13. Liquidation of long wheat by com
mlscion houses and by local professionals was
a pronounced feature at the opening. AÂ« the
section advanced th-. offerings Increased in
volume. News of the day failed to furnish
satisfactory explanation fcr the desire to sell.
A* a result of contradictory advices regarding
th* Argentine situation an easier tonÂ« waa
manifested in the Liverpool wheat market,
but the slight decline there was seemingly
cot of sufficient importance to warrant heavy
selling here. â¢ Receipts â  in the > Northwest
showed only a moderate Increase, compared
with yesterday's arrivals. One noticeable
feature of trading was the offerings by a com
mission house, total sales of the day for this
account being in the neighborhood of 5,000 000
bushels. It was eald. Smaller holders were
influenced - by . these dealings and sold freely
Offerings. so far exceeded the demand that
prices dropped throughout the day. The low
point on May was 'reached at $1.10i{@1.10*i'
Tne market -closed exceedingly weak, with
May 2fcc lower at $1,104- â â . . .

Bran continues very firm, with light stocks
and a gcod demand, but no further advance Is
announced.
Hay was again In liberal receipt yesterday,
' the arrivals being SCI tons, including 75 car*.
: The market was quiet and steadv. It is nnder
1 stood that. on January 9 the GoverniÂ£?at will
â  open bids for 6S50 tons, deliverabls between
Febrnary 1 and September 13.
The circular of Somers & Co. says:
i "Hay shipments have been rather heavy
j during the week just ended, the total showing
| 3300 tons in comparison with but 2100 for the
i week preceding. This Increase In shipments
l has been occasioned by the fact that cars are
â¢ now more plentiful. Some of the Hay which
: has just arrived was ordered to market several
; weeks ago and some points have be-en denied
shipments entirely until the last few days,
i It Is reported at raialroad headquarters that
â¢ from now on cars will be morÂ» plentiful. This
i will enable_us to Judge more- accurately as to
I the general Idea of the farmers about holding
I their Hay. We do not anticipate any very
! great rush for the next month or two; on the
other hand, we are inclined to . anticipate a
rather quiet demand for that same period, so
there is very little that promises any better
] market here for some little time. It is ru
: mored that the Government will be In thÂ»
; market for Hay very shortly, but as their or
der" are generally divided among their various
transports it" is seldom that any good effect
Is felt from this business. ,
I "Shipping trade alcng the coast has been
i exceedingly quiet for several weeks, and from
! what we can learn there Is not much prospect
; of any Improvement along this line until next
; spring.
â¢â¢Quite a bit of Wheat Hay has been coming
i to market during the past few days, which
| has tended to weaken the situation with this
; particular grade of Hay. although we can
I quote no lower prices. Other grades continue
to come quite freely and hold their own at
unchanged figures."

reported a fair movement In medlom-prlced
Apples, . that Is, stock worth from 65c to 65c

PLAN TO SEGREGATE MINERAL
CLAIMS AND PROTECT MINERS

Advantages.
Lawson Recom

Map for State.
A matter of general concern to the
ruiners of tl.Â» UiÂ»itpd States wan
brought yorftcrddy before the conven
tion of tho CRlilornia Miners' Associa
tion by means pf a pai>er prepared by
E. A. Bok-ln-r. in which the mineral
land laws were discussed.
"A Fedcrai commission," reported
Mr. Beirh.tr, yhas in charge the re
vision of the statutes of the United
States that provide for the sale of
publh- lands. It has already prepared
its report upon the pre-emption and
homestead laws and is now ready to
take un the statutes relating to the
public mineral lands. The commission
will welcome- any aid. I have thought
that tht: attention of the California
Miner*' Association ought to be drawn
.to tho matter, hj that it may take such
â¢iction as it may deem proper."
I Mr. Bdcfter had already taken pains
; to advisi-. Ciii\>rd Pinchot, secretary
of the Commission on Public L;tnds,
<of his views and had been thanked by
Professor J J imhjt. who expressed the
view that by (such action Belcher had
iriade "an *-ju.ecding!y valuable addi
tion to the datn which the Commission
i>n Public I^ands is collecting."
I Mr. He'eher wrote to the convention
Â»f California miners that one of the
suggestions hÂ« offered was new, and
"if carried into effect it will sub
stantially accomplish the segregation
of the mineral lands so far as may be
done without tho aid of a geological
commission in the field. It will do
away with th? spoliation of unpatent
<1 landt <â¢ tvered by mining locations.
It will juormplish a great part of the
ffood intended to be accomplished by
the "mineral lands bill," toward which
there was such active hostility that it
could not he enacted into a statute."
Mr. Belcher proposes to do away with
much confusing procedure now re
quired in filing claims by revising cer
tain laws and creating new ones. These
laws should also be framed with a view
to doing away with the perplexing "lo
cal rules aivd regulations of miners."
The mineral lands bill was once a
favorite measure of the California
Miners' Association. The delegates
therefore listened with much attention
to what Mr. Belcher had to say. He
proposed a new method of recording
mining locations and said that if the
suggestion could be embodied in legis
lation it would furnish a greater safe
iruard than the miners have had. He
said:
"It will connect their locations with
the paramount source of title. the
General Government, hitherto impos
sible under th.3 system of recording in
use. and # thus frive notice to the Gen
eral Government that the land is
claimed as mineral. A mining location
eo recorded would prevent the selec
tion or location of the land oinder other
laws without the knowledge of the
miner. It would give the honest miner
what he has not had. It would pre
vent the spoliation of his mine by oth
ers without notice to him."
SIGGKSTS MEASURES.
SusrpeptionF v.ere offered by Mr.
Belcher as follows:
1â The extralateral right should be utterly
abolished. It is a thing of evil. Within my
reading no one statutory provision has been
fo productive of endless and costly litigation
ar this. No mine owner can Bay with as
surance that hiÂ« title is quieted for all tim*.
At any stag" some new development may start
i new suit : at any depth h!Â« vein may Inter
sect another and be lost to him if he chances
to be the Junior locator; at any point his vein
Is liable to develop into a complex fissure and
ln\-olvt h:m in endless controversy over the
do'trtn? cf underlay and connecting veins.
2 â The niW for iwrfectlng a mining location
n-tjulre radical Hianges: nevertheless, changes
â¢should h* advise ily f-onrtdered so as not to
handicap too severely the honest miner.
3 â The new KeJeral law should be compre
hensive. It should provide for a record In the
land offlcr and ehctild provide, negatively, that
no other r*rord be required. That, so far as
coiwt mines not patented, would do away
with the reoord of the County Recorder and
the rc-eoro of the local raining district and
t**Â»ir accompanying expenses and dangerous
uncertainties. Fueh provision, of course, would
rot **Â» retroactive, it would apply to future
condition? and would not disturb the chain
ef any title already initiated.
The proposed lejrisl.-uion should. Â«lÂ«o, Jn ex
act terms, do away with that continuing aourc*
cf Ir.nnii*- |x*rr>les:Uy. the local rules Â«nd r*xu
lation? of miners. The tenth censun report
contains 'Tan nee King's compilation of the
local rules and regulation* of miners, but it
Â«loes not oont&Jn all of them, for many exist
only in tradition and can b* :>roved only
through thut dangerous njedlumâ parole. A.
matter Â«o Imjior'snt as a rule that is to af
fect conduct I'Ujht not tS be teft to parole.
Besides. th*-rr is no cood reason why there
rhoulo not be uniformity of procedure. The
naoMrtly far uniformity of procedure 1* daily
t***>minfr moreâ and more exigent In ail af
fairs, particularly those of a legal nature. The
propowd new *y-Km. then-fore, should be a
complete syÂ»;t*m Â»nd it should be exclusive If
a mine is worth working, it is worth patent-

Mr. Belcher reviewed existing condi
tions. He said that the Congressional
Philippines mining act of 1902. the
latest legislation on the subject of ex
tralateral rights, provides for a claim
1000x1000 feet and within the boundary
lines of which, continued vertically
downward on every side, the locator is
entitled to all the minerals.- Belcher
was of the opinion that there was no
sound objection to vertical planes for
boundaries. Continuing, he. said:
It Hi easily perceivable that If a ledge should
chance to run beyond the vertical planes of the
boundaries at â¢ a depth still â  permitting work,
then, as the only discovery possible would be
by the own*r at the place of crossing, he could
make a side location based on his own dis
covery at the i>lace of crossing >and protect
himself. His would be the only valid location
as being the only location founded' upon dis
covery. In almost any contingency the owner
of the criminal location would be in a situation
to protect himsplf against the "jumper." *>e
cause the "â¢jumper" could make no discovery
upon which to found a valid location of the
ground lying- to the side of the original loca
catlon Into which the ledge projects on its dip
after crossing the vertical boundary of the
original location. The only possibility of any
trr.uhl* accruing to the owner of the original
location, where the ledge crosses his boun
dary and he desires to continue to work It.
would be where a side location embraced an
apex of Its own from which to the lod-? of the
original location there might, at the depth of
the boundary crossing, be a crosscut. But such
a contingency would be provided against by
Riving to the owner of 'the original location
the right to make a side location calculated to
embrace the dip of his original ledge at any
feasible depth. Ordinarily, however,, within
tne perpendicular planes of the location the
vein could be worked as deep as would be' de
sired cr as practicable.
Speaking ti the conditions that have
attended tji\r patenting of mines and
the making of mining locations,
Bplcher said in part:
Save in the occasional ' Instances where
patents to mines have been obtained, as com
pared with the vast number of mining -loca
tions In which iso land-office proceedings look
ing to i.atent have been taken, there is ;no
definitive eegregatlor of mineral lands from
agricultural. The fault is that of the system.
In no other land than, ours would such a
system be tolerated. Under the Federal â¢ law
the mrre location, together with the required
expenditure for labor and Improvement, gives
permissive title for an Indefinite periodâ that
Is. it is supposed to do so. The statute does
not compel the locator to procure a patent;
It doe? net ever, require him to record his
location. Only State or mining-district laws
require a record. -.;..,.. .
METHOD IS FAULTY.
As a consequence, under the Federal law
unless proceedings to obtain a patent are in
itiated, there is nothing to connect the rain
ing location with the land officeâ the place
provided by law for disposition of the pub
lie lands. In the absence of an application
iÂ«r patent no one can know anything about
a hiininB location save the locator, those'whom
he 'has informed, those who may chancer to be
on the ground and see the stakes, and these
who arc constructively informed, by the record
of the location !n the office. of 1 he ' recorder
of the . mining" district ! of the office of the
County Recorder. ': Â«\" -
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALli; THURSDAY, "DECEMBER 8, 1004.
Such record is supposed to give construc
tive notice, but its capacity in that direction
is limited. Confessedly, it is no notice at all
to the paramcunt proprietor â the United
States. The United States knows of nothing
relating to its public domain, the Â£Â«peclflc
grants of the Congress excepted, save such
matters as, under its laws for the disposal of
the public- domain. appear In the United
States land offices where the public domain Is
sold. The land office Is for the General Gov
ernment the recording office. It knows what
Is there of record, but it does not know what
is of record In the offices of mini,ng record
ers or the offlces of county "reorders, and
does not and. In the nature of things, can
not take any constructive notice therefrom.
As it is the owner of the land It cannot
take notice of j anything affecting ' the title
save what Is of -record in the place it has
provided for that specific purpose. The lawa
of mining districts and of some of the State
jequire a record of mining locations, but the
reason for requiring a mining location to be
recorded in a local office antedating the enact
ment of the Federal mining law long since
lost Its. force because Federal surveys *of the
public lands have since been widely extend
ed. General- withdrawals of wide regions sup
posedly mineral in character, such as the
withdrawals In accordance with the report of
J. Ross Browne in the seventies, have been
set asiJe ab contacting with the policy of the
Government for the disposition of the public
domain as a means, of increasing the na
tional wealth and resources, and because the
real policy of the Government, notwithstand
ing the imperfect provisions of the law. Is
that the m:neral lands shall be sold as such
and not reserved as such. .'/'.-.
Strange complications have occurred.
Mr. Belcher gave specific instances. In
a general way the following presenta
tion was made:
In Instances known mineral lands have been
returned as Â»uch by the deputy agricultural
surveyors In tbe field and platted as of that
character: but otherwise than as they are so
platted from casual examination or informa
tion, and otherwise than as serregated by
deputy United < States mineral surverors in
patent proceedings, the Government maps give
no informstlort es to what are mineral lands
Some of the best mines have been discovered
upon lands surveyed, returned and platted an
being agricultural in character. .
In places, nubile lands returned as agricult
ural In character, or at least aÂ» not mineral,
are In fact covered by mining locations, duly
recorded under local rules, of which the
United States land offloes have no knowledge.
This condition of fact I* not merely bad: It
is shocklne- It I* time the law was changed.
Yet any chance that would put too severe a
burden upon the hardy prcspector and honesc
miner would fall short of attaining the object
The present system does not protect the hon
est miner. Where the land In which his mine
Is situated has .been returned as agricultural,
unless he initiates patent proceedings, he is at
the mercy of the scrlpper. the purchaser from
thÂ» gtate under school selections and even from
purchasers under the timber and stone acts.
WOULD RECORD CLAIMS.
_In* reference to recording mining lo
cations Mr. Belcher expressed his views
as follows: â /â .-, \ _';;,>
The Federal statute should require mining
locations to be recorded In and noted .upon
the records of the United States land offices.
Such a system would end many of the miners
troubles, because it would connect his location
with the paramount: source of title Such a
system would prevent any disposition of. the
land covered by a mining location without
notice to the miner. A general mineral affi
davit that certain land is mineral in character
is of no practical efficacy, as has been clearly
shown, because a notice to disprove mineral,
published in some obscure newspaper, might
never be Been by the miner.
His mine is frequently far removed from any.
pohtofflce arid his means of information as: to
what in going on in the outside world scanty.
Frequently he takes no paper. Sometimes â  he
cannot read, but he would understand a sumr'
mons served upon him personally. His loca
tion so recorded, would Import I certainly,
would require, a personal , service, upon him of
any â¢ Drocess affecting .the title to his claim,
and thus he" would be given his day. In court.
Where the location should be. of a placer It
would â  conform to : legal subdivisions and be
readily noted- on .the Dlat books, but -where
It should- be of a Jode claim. It â  would require
a survey in the first instance to establish â¢ re
lation to eubdivlslonal line*, no as to make. a
proper segregation . from contiguous non-mln
erar lands. In the land office It would be
merely a matter of bookkeeping. " . â  .
â¢ There ; are other feasible means of > segre
gating, the public mineral lands.. By -the sys-.
tern of -recording proposed they would ; beJssg
regated, .and- the land office, the only place
provided by law for the disposition - of Â£ the
public lands, wouid have precise and first hand
knowledge of the .status of the lands > subject
to sale. In Mexico and British 'Columbia noth
ing Is left to chance as here. An official seg
regation â¢ of each mining . location is â¢ made at
the outset, j . â -. ' 'â¢' :
By : the' system proposed .the ' plats' of," the
deputy surveyor of the < district and
of the land office would always .agree, and
conflicting locations, now so easy to, make and
so 'fruitful of litigation or blackmail, would
not - be. . permitted without : a showing ; under
oath, nor unless It should appear that the con
flicting = party had eome substantial litlgable
interest not - merely negligible. , . -.
.. Doubtless this procedure - would 'â  reduce I the
number of locations recorded,- but It. would
have a tendency .to- make prospecting more
thorough and extensive, 'as Is the case. In Can*
ada and- Mexico. The. statute could provide
that a miner should: (lave â¢. a .definite time
after discovery within which to make 'and file
his location. v
The. law should also, require a locator to
procure a patent within a specified period,^ say
within â¢ five â¢ years " after ' recording â < the â¢ location
in the land office. -If a mine is worth work
ing, it is worth patenting, and there Is- no rea
son why the - owner., of a' mine Â£ should not be
required to; get a patent while the owner of
a farm 1*. The period of five years - is sug
geBted by analogy to the homestead law. -â¢* ;;. - :"

CONVENTION OF CALIFORNIA
MINERS" ASSOCIATION
University of California. The last
named suggested that a State geolog
ical map is '; necessary, and that the
University of California is equipped to
make such map' and ? the preliminary
survey. A resolution on the subject was
referred to the committee on resolu
tions. :â â¢*- .
The constitution and by-laws of the
association were amended, principally
in the matter of dues, and a rule estab
lished that hereafter all who apply for
admission to the society shall be con
sidered by a committee appointed for
that purpose. There was considerable
discussion over a provision making the
annual dues of a member of the-asso
ciation $5 instead of $1. The $5 provi
sion was adopted as reported by the
revision committee. This was the first
discussion of the convention. Incident
ally the share that San Francisco mer
chants have taken in sustaining the
association was brought up, and sev
eral members credited San Francisco
with being liberal in the premises. The
fixing of a new rate of dues does not
interfere in any way with the county
organizations of miners, who continue
to fix their dues and elect their dele
gates to the State convention, as be
fore. The dues established are as fol
lows, for others than individuals: Min
ing companies, $25: 'mercantile and man
ufacturing firms in San Francisco and
Los r Angeles connected â with mining,
$50; mercantile and "manufacturing
firms, in San Francisco and Los An
geles not connected . with mining but
friendly to it,. $25;: firms outside of Los
Angeles and San '. Francisco,' $25.

SAYS LETC1IER SHOULD -â  â¢_
BE RETURNED TO OHIO
Attorney General Webb Declares San
Jose Man : Is Really a Fugitive
'â : . From Justice.
1 Attorney General Webb has ren
dered an opinion that George E.
Letcher is a fugitive from Justice. The
requisition of the Governor of Ohio
will be honored and the prisoner will
be sent East under guard unless the
courts order his release on a writ of
habeas corpus, for which his attorneys
will immediately prepare' a petition.
Letcher was arrested recently In
San Jose on the charge of defrauding
an insurance company In Williams
County, Ohio. He began a legal bat
tle against extradition and Governor
Pardee decided to refer the matter to
the Attorney General before taking
action. Letcher avers that he left
Ohio without molestation; that he has
lived openly under his own name in
California, and' that therefore he is
not a "fugitive from Justice.!* The
defendant was a resident of Ohio at
the time of the commission of the
crime and though he was not indicted
before his departure the Attorney
General holds that he is really a fugi
tive from justice and that the extradi
tion papers should be honored.
To Investigate Street Bill*.
The Street Committee yesterday re
ferred to the Finance Committee for
investigation the refusal of, Gray Bros,
to rent their street sweeping machines
to the city because the bills for the
same, aggregating $2812 51, had been
refused payment by the Finance Com
mittee on the alleged ground that the
charges are excessive.
E. Troy called attention to the rails
on the north side of Page street, from
Devisadero to Stanyan, which are not
u&ed by the United Railroads. The
committee decided to formulate a list
of the streets upon which it is alleged
the, company does not use, its tracks.

Frenchman Changes Name.
A petition for permission to change
his name was filed In the Superior
Court yesterday by' Darblub Enutroff.

Fortune Boulbard. His father, John
Boulbard. recently died in France and
thÂ»; petitioner says the change is nec
essary in order to settle his property
interests. He explains that his change
of name to the outlandish one he now
seeks to shake was done in "youthful
thoughtlessness." A- glance at his self
made cognomen will show that it Is
an anagram of his own name. Dar-
Mud can be twisted into Bulbard and
Enutroff -spelled backward la "Ffor
tune." ,
