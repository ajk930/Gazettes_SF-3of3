CORRUPTION OF POLICE IN CHINATOWN
LAID BARE BY GRAND JURY.
IN anticipation of the trial of Sergeant Thomas P. Ellis, which was begun before the Police Commission last night, the Grand
Jury yesterday made report of his startling confession that $250 a week was paid him by the Chinatown gamblers while he was
in command of the " squad. v The patrolmen received $40 a week. Only two of them confessed â Henry M. Heinz and R. R.
Chan Cheung was the disbursing agent in the great scheme of corruption. Ellis yielded up Si 330 of his ill-gotten
gains, and this sum was turned over to Judge Lawlor by Foreman Andrews.

ASSASSIN'S
BULLET FOR
PROCURATOR
Adviser oi Finnish
Senate Slain by
a Youth.
HELSINGFORS. Feb. s.â Soisalon
Soininen, Procurator General of Fin
land, who before he was ennobled was
known by the name of Johnsson, was
assassinated to-day by a young man
whose identity up to the present time
has not been determined. The assassin
of Soininen and his son were both
wounded in a duel following the mur
der. The motive for the crime appar
ently was purely political, the slain
official being a prominent member of
the Government party.
The murderer appeared at the Pro
curator's residence at 11 o'clock and
sent in a card m French bearing the
name of Alexander Gadd, who is In the
Russian service. The young man, who
was smartly dressed In an officer's uni
form, was at once admitted lo the of
ficial's study, and upon hiÂ» entrance
,fired f<var shots from a revolver, one of
the bullets piercing the breast of the
Procurator, who expired almost in
stantly.
Solnlnen's 17-year-old son, hearing
the shots, rushed in fmm an adjoining
room and fired three or four shots at
the assassin, whose right leg was
broken below the knee by a bullet. He
also was slightly wounded in the
shoulder and a finger of his left hand
was struck.
The assassin fired the one bullet re
maining in his revolver at Soininen's
son, wounding him slightly in the calf
of the right leg. He then endeavored
to escape, but fell unconscious on the
floor of the anteroom. There he was
seized.
Dr. Wasastjerna was called imme
diately, but found the Procurator be
yond the need of his services. The as- :
sassin was removed to the surgical !
hospital, where he lies guarded by po
lice, answering no questions and evi
dently unconscious. His recovery, how
ever, is believed to be certain. Up to
the present the authorities have been
unable to identify him. He is of dark
complexion and apparently between 25
and 30 years old.
Soininen was born in 1856 and prac
ticed at the Finnish bar. He was high
ly esteemed and had held various gov
ernment appointments, including that
of Provincial Judge. He was appointed
Procurator General of the Duchy of
Finland.
Soininen was regarded as a wise and
patriotic official. Tt is understood that
it wasr at his initiative that tho Finns
exiled by governor General Bobrikoff
were allowed to return to Finland.
ERA OP TERRORISM FEARED.
ST. PETERSBURG. Feb. 7.â The
news of the assassination otf Soisalon
Soininen, Procurator General of Fin
land, was not generally known in St.
Petersburg last night, but may be ex
pected to produce a great sensation
when it becomes public, as It will be
regarded as the precursor of an era of
terrorism for which the events of Jan
uary In St. Petersburg and throughout
Russia gave the signal.
Until the identity of the assassin Is
definitely known. It will be impossible,
of course, to establish the motive for
the attempt; but the present circum
stances in Finland render almost cer
tain that the crime is of a purely politi
cal character and of the same nature
as the assassination of Count Bob
rikoff. the Governor General of Fin
land, in June of last year.
Tbe Russlflcation of the province of
Finland has been meeting with great
opposition and creating much bitter
ness, especially since the formation of
the party of active resistance, which is
recruiting from the bolder spirits of the
original party of passive resistance and
to which the perpetrator of this latest
crime probably belonged.
At the conference of revolutionary
parties of Russia, comprising represen
tatives of the Finnish active resistance
party, the Polish National League, the
Russian Emancipationists and other
revolutionary organizations in Berlin
last night, a programme for general
concerted action was drawn up, and
i the assassin of Soininen undoubtedly
was in tc-uch with the dissatisfied ele
ment in Russia. As a matter of fact,
never before in the history of the em
pire have events of an anti-govern
mental nature been in closer connec
tion, as has been shown by the general
spread of the strike movement: and the
assassination of Soininen, though prin
cipally inspired by the grievances af
the Finnish Nationalists, undoubtedly
was also spurred on by the use of
troops against the strikers in 3t. Pe
tersburg and elsewhere.
SOIXIXEN MARKED FOR DEATH.
Little is known regarding the mur
der, but as Procurator General Soininen
was the adviser of the Finnish Senate,
which incurred the enmity of the anti-

DISAPPEAR
Guest at St. Francis
Is Minus Her
- Jewels.
The management of the St. Francis
Hotel, assisted by members of the lo
cal detective force, was engaged last
evening in tryirrg to gain some clew
that would solve the mystery surround
ing the disappearance of a box of dia
monds and jewelry belonging to a
prominent guest of the big hostelry.
Up to a late hour this morning the
detectives had not found the slightest
clew to the missing gems, but they
have not given up hope of recovering
them. For several weeks the St. Fran
cis has included among its must fash
ionable guests Mr. and Mrs. E. M. Hol
brook of Minneapolis. Holbrook is a
wealthy lumberman, who, accompanied
by his handsome wife, came to the
coast on business.

valuables that! had been deposited m
one of the hotel safes. ..The visitors
were conveyed to the ferry in a car
riage and were accompanied by the
runner of , the hotel, who had been en
gaged to assist them in carrying their
hand baggage across the bay.
When the Oakland mole was reached
and ihe Holbrooks were about to enttr
the overland train Mrs. Holbrook, with
natural womanly instinct, suddenly
asked her husband If her jewel case
was all right and, much to the surprise
of both, it was discovered that the
valuable receptacle was missing. Hol
brook was positive that he had carried
the jewels from the hutel to the car
riage, and thinking that possibly he
had left them behind in the conveyance
he immediately telegraphed the man
agement of the St. Francis to institute
a search for them.
Acting upon his request the hotel
peo-ple hunted up the hack driver, who
had turned in his vehicle and gone to
his home, but he disclaimed all knowl
edge of the Jewels and cleared himself
of any suspicion by establishing as a
fact that he had not dismounted when
he reached the ferry depot with his pas
sengers, but that the hotel runner, w ho
had accompanied him, had gat hie red to
gether the coats and parcels ul the Hol
brooks and followed them across the
bay on the ferry.
Although the management of the St.
Francis was apparently absolved from
any responsibility, it decided to insti
tute a further search, and called in the
local detectives to assist in the case.
Notwithstanding that Holbrook was
certain that he had taken the jewels
away from the hotel a careful search
of the apartments vacated by himaelf
and wife was made, but without fruit
ful results. Holbrook expressed no dis
position to suspect the hotel runner.
who had accompanied him across the
bay, and the detectives finally arrived
at the conclusion that the wealthy lum
berman had carelessly left the valu
ables somewhere at the ferry or on the
boat. Acting on this theory the de
tectives at midnight were quietly try
ing to find out whether any person had
found the missing jewels.
Mrs. Holbrook was anxious to re
turn to San Francisco, with the hop*
of lending assistance to the detectives
in their search, but her husband, who
has business engagements In the East.
Insisted that their journey should be

It appears from the evidence that when raids
were made by the Chinatown squad It was

Ellis Says He at Xo Time Accused the
Sergeant. â¢
Sergeant Ellis said last night that
the Grand Jury must have misunder*

the statement that Sergeant Christian*

get bribe money.
"Christiansen never directed me to
Chan Cheung or to any one else foi
corruption money nor did I so tell the
grand jurors." Ellis declared to the
press. "The jurors certainly miscon
strued what I said to them. I am
sorry that such a grave reflection has
been cast on the character of Sergeant
Christiansen when there is no founda

h.-ive to say in regard ( to the Grand

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 1005.
BEGINS TRIAL
OF SERGEANT
TOM ELLIS
After Long Delay
Police Board
Acts.
FAiN-TAN EXPERTS
Chinese Testify
to Gambling
Raids.
CHIEF TAKES HAND
The long deferred trial of Police Ser
geant Ellis under the charges preferred
by ex-Commissioner Hutton, that Ellis
allowed gambling in Chinatown and
that he warned the various gambling
clubs that were paying for police im
munity that a Police Commissioner
was about to make a visit, began be
fore the Police Commissioners last
night.
The proceedings started with the
reading of the charges of Hutton
against Sergeant Ellis. Several Chi
nese witnesses were then placed on the
stand to testify as to gambling in Chi
natown. With the examination of the
Chinese the situation changed from a
trial of Ellis to the placing of Chief
Wittman on the defensive.
Several Chinese said that they had
been told by representatives of the
Eight Statesmen Society that the mon
ey collected for prelection was turned
over to the Chief of Police. The last
witness, Long Hong Poo, testified that
Attorney Grant L. Carpenter told
twenty Chinese of the Educational So
ciety that a Police Commissioner was
going to make a raid. This testimony
favored Ellis' case and pleased Chief
Wittman. t
Hutton tried repeatedly to make the
witness say that he was the only Chi
naman notified by Carpenter and that
the notification took place just prior to
the raid, but failed.
The delayed session began with a
reading of an answer by President Po
heim to the severe criticism of the Po
lice Commission by the Grand Jury,
and then the case of Sergeant Ellis was
called.
Hutton was the first witness to take
the stand after his charges against El
lis had been read. He was questioned
in turn by Chief Wittman and Attorney
Richard Mogan for Sergeant Ellis, and
he retold the story of his visits to the
Chinatown gambling den. He was fol
lowed on the stand by Irving McAfee,
formerly a messenger boy, who testi
fied to his delivering the note sent by
Hutton to Ellis making an appointment
to meet for the purpose of visiting the
dens.
Lee Sing, the third witness called,
testified that a Chinese named Wong
Yu telephoned the house at 820 Wash
ington street that a Police
sioner was coming and that they would
do well to close the place. The Chinese
who received the message was Chin
Bok Gai, one of the Eight Statesmen of
Chinatown.
At the time the telephone bell rang,
Lee Sing said, he was gambling and
stood about ten feet from the phone.
After Chin Bok Gai had finished talk
ing he gave orders to close up and stop,
as a Policy Commissioner was coming.
On cross-examination the witness
said that representatives of the Eight
Statesmen who collected the money
had said that it was for the Chief of
Police. Wittman then askÂ«d the wit
ness why he did not say that in his
previous testimony. Lee Sing replied
that he had not been asked the ques
tion. "Isn't it a fact," continued Witt
man, "that Carpenter and the China
man who is the head of the Educational
Society told you to change your testi
mony and that since last testifying
you have 'cooked ud' evidence?"
"No," replied the witness.
The next Chinaman was Chin Fay,
a gambler, who has been living at the
Educational Society for four years. He
told of the payment .of protection
money at 11 Ross alley, where the price
was $5 for each fantan table operated.
This witness also said that he heard
that the Chief of Police received the
money. Again Wittman asked if he
was not coached in testifying by Car
penter and again receive*! a negative
reply.
The last witness of the evening,
Long Hong Poo. grave the most Im
portant testimony regarding the warn
ing of the various gambling dens. He
said that Attorney Carpenter had in
formed him and twenty other Chinese
at the Educational Society that a Po
lice Commissioner was about to raid
the gambling clubs. This information
was given out between 7 and 8 o'clock
in the evening, nearly two hours before
Hutton made his visit. Sharp cross
questionins by Hutton failed to shake
the testimony.

POHEIM DENOUNCES GRAND
JURORS AS HYPOCRITES.
Says They Are Doing Politics
CHARGES POLICE COMMITTEE WITH
AUDACiTY AND RANK INSINCERITY
The Police Commissioners were in re
sentful mood last night at the asper
sions cast on them by the Gr^.nd Jury.
Dr. J. F. Poheim was the only one
who spoke out in meeting, however.
Immediately on calling the board to
order and in a voice that showed nam
ing wrath he denounced the police com
mittee^ of the Grand Jury as having
shameless audacity.
The new Commissioner called the
committee hypocritical and insincere
for refusing to indict policemen and
sergeants against whom it pretended to
have found evidence. The entire con
duct of the police committee of the
Grand Jury was said to savor more of
a desire to do politics than to adminis
ter justice. The doctor spoke as fol
lows:
Gentlemen of the Commission â I desire at
this time to call your attention to thÂ» pub
lished reports of the police committee of the
Grand Jury to-day, which, in my opinion, Is
a deliberate mfcstatcment of the attitude of
thlg commission and a declaration of rank In
justice toward It. The police committee
â¢ays:
â \\Â» regret, indeed, that our urgent appeal
for further time was not granted and to such
refusal we lay the responsibility for our failure
to adduce evidence that would convict the
guilty parties in a court of law."
Nothing that this commission has done has
In the slightest degree interfered with the
work of the Grand Jury or with any Investi
gation which it has made or may desire to
make and any statement to the contrary la
untrue. It is true that I have protested
against any further delay in the trial of the
cases of the accused police officers who are
before this commission on charges, of negtect
of duty. My reasons for insisting upon a trial
are these: It has been a matter of common
report for many weeks that certain members
of thÂ« Grand Jury, to wit. Messrs. Andrews
and Bowes, had secured a confession from
some of the accused officers admitting cor
ruption and bribery of themselves, and I was
also several times Informed that a sum of
money, approximating fifteen hundred dollars
of bribe money received by these officers, was
in the possession of the grand Jurors men
tioned.
GUARANTEED IMMUNITY.
who had confessed, but also that they would
guarantee Immunity at the hands of this
It was my wish to bring these charges to a
hearing in order to ascertain whether or not
any of the men accused had actually accepted
bribes as stated, and if such was the case 7
did not propose to be a party to any pro
ceeding whereby corrupt or dishonest men
should remain upon the police force of this city
while I was a member of this commission and
I did not care whether or not the police com
mittee of the Grand Jury or any member of it
had made such a bargain In consideration of a
confession or otherwise.
On the other hand If the men were inno
cent. I thought they should have a chance to
establish their innocence within a reasonable
time and not remain upon the police fore*
GRAND JURY BLOCKED.
Foreman Andrtws Sayfe inquiry Into
Clilnatowit Graft Is Ended.
"The Grand Jury is now through
with investigation of police corruption
in Chinatown, " said Foreman Andrews
yesterday. "As is set forth in our re
port, the announcement of the Police
Commission that it would proceed with
its inquiry thwarted all our plans. We
will drop the whole matter and devote
ourselves to other things."
The foreman expresses regret that
the Grand Jury could take no steps to
prosecute the bribe takers because all
the evidence available is that of co
conspirators and the statute is explicit
that there can be no conviction on
such evidence unless it is corroborated
by other witnesses.
"We had hopes," continued the
foreman, "that we might find an in
dictment against Chan Cheung for
bribing the police, but District Attor
ney Byington advised us t^iat, inas
much as the testimony was all that of
fellow conspirators, we could not do
so."
Concerning the report that the
Grand Jury had assured Ellis that he
would be "taken care of" because he
made a clean breast of everything,
Andrews made- an emphatic denial.
"No promise was made to Ellis or any
other policeman by myself or any
member of the Grand Jury," asserted
the foreman.
It appears that the police commit
tee of the Grand Jury had very little
difficulty in extracting the confession
from-. Ellis. "We had a line of his ac
cepting money from Chan Cheung,"
Andrews explains, "and after plying
him with questions for about an hour
and a half he began to make admis
sions. It took some time to get the
whole story from him, but he finally
tbld freely everything in connection
with his wrongdoing.
"We asked him what became of the
$2000 he had received and he said he
had kept most of It I sent for a car
riage at night and he took me to his
home, where he had $1330 concealed
in the china closet.
"When preÃsed as to what became
of the rest of the money Chan Cheung
Had paid him he Insisted that he had
spent it in personal use. He denied
repeatedly under a hot fire of ques
tioning that he had shared his collec
tions with any one or had agreed to
do so. Asked if Chief Wittman or any
higher official was to get a part of Â£he
graft Ellis answered no time and time
again and asserted positively that there
was no 'divvying.' The money was all
for himself he said.
"Ellis' statement to- us of the con
spiracy of the Chinatown squad was
corroborated in part by the confessions
of Patrolmen Henry M. Heinz and R.
R. O'Brien that they accepted $40 a
week from Chan Cheung. These three
policemen were the only members of
the squad that acknowledged thei~
guilt. All the others were called, but
under the most rigid examination made
stout denial.
"We tried to follow up Ellis' state
ment that Sergeant Christiansen told
him to call on Chan Cheung for dis
bursements from the sack. But Chris
tiansen said that he never knew of
Chan Cheung's control of the corrup
tion fund and met everything with a
square denial. We could do nothing
with only one man's statement against
another's.
"Probably things would have de
veloped along the whole line had the
Police Commissioners not Interfered
with our plans. We had a campaign
carefully mapped out, but everything
went awry and now we have been com
pelled to give up what looked for a
while like a promising field. Chan
Cheung thwarted us, of course, for in
view of Eilis' confession we expected
to break him down.
"The result is very unsatisfactory to
me. We wanted to get somebody
'higher up." There is not much satis
faction in exposing Sergeant Ellis and
doing police duty every day under the cloud
of these acc-usatluns and charges.
I must say that I did not accept with much
pleasure the open statements made before this
commk-sion by Sergeant Ellis that Mr. Bowes
of the Grand Jury had in effect told him to
pay no attention to the* orders of the Police
Commission and not to prepare himself for
trial when ordered.
From the report of the police committee of
the Grand Jury tc-day it is apparent tfaat
there was more or less truth in the reports
which have reached me and it seems strange
Indeed that with this evidence in their pos
session aud with their expressed desire to run
wnnEfdoers to earth the grand jurors have
r*: trained from bringing any accusations of any
kind as-ainst the men who, they say, have
confessed their wrongdoing. It certainly looks
to n>e very much as if there was more truth
in the statements of Immunity promised than
th-? iwlice committee of the Grand Jury is
willing to state in Its report.
CALLS IT AX EXCUSE.
I cannot see how an investigation by this
commission Into the conduct of these officers
fan at all obstruct the work of the Grand
Jury in ferreting out bribe taking: or corrup
tion in any direction, and I am led to believe
that thh; Is but a poor excuse to rover up the
fact that they are unable to procure any fur
ther evidence.
Without desiring- to make any comment in
this connection favorable or unfavorable to the
fcead. of the police force of this city, whose
duty and opportunity It has been to exercise
absolute control over these officers, they are
very free with their comment on this commis
sion, one of whom, to-wit: myself, was ap
pointed long subsequent to the acts charged;
another of whom. Commissioner Drinkhouse,
hits not only been constant in his endeavors
to suppress gambling In Chinatown, but has
even made personal raids; and the other. Com
missioner Reagan, has always earnestly co-oper
ated in the same direction.
And it looks to me very much aa if there
was more "politics" than a desire to be Just
in the report of the police committee of the
Grand Jury.
So tar is it from the truth that this commis
sion hay ever thrown any obstacles In the way
of the Grand Jury committee or that It desires
to do so that, on behalf of the entire commis
sion, I now offer publicly to co-operate with
the Grand Jui-y In any effort to obtain any
evidence or to confirm any Information it may
have on any subject whatever, and will place
the entire Police Department of the city at
its disposal for this service, but this commis
sion does not propose to have any two mem
bers of the Grand Jury run -its business with
out even having the Common courtesy of first
consulting the commission, and, so long as I
am president of the board, let me assure you,
gentlemen, they will not do bo with my con
sent.
And In conclusion, permit me to say that I
ilo not believe that ever in the history of this
country has a committee of a Grand Jury ha.l
Ihe shameless audacity to admit that it la in
possession of positive evidence of guilt and
yet fall to Indict the guilty, as Is the case
here
And, as an American citizen as well as a
member of this commission, I resent the hypo
critical and Inconsistent action of that com
mittee and am willing to have the people of
ban Francisco Judge as between this commis
sion and the police committee of the Grand
Jury which is the more honest In the execu
tion of its duty.
MAKES VIGOROUS DENIAL.
Christiansen Declares He Did Xot Give
Ellis the Tip.
"If Sergeant Ellis says I told him to
go to Chan Cheung for bribe money
he speaks an utter falsehood," de
clared Sergeant Christiansen yester
day. "If he says that I ever discussed
police duty with him on other than
honest and legitimate lines he is lying.
I am ready for an investigation at any
time. I have nothing to conceal."
Sergeant Christiansen is now on
duty in the Southern district, under
the command of Captain Spillane.
Christiansen was in charge of the
Chinatown squad for nine months and
was transferred on October 1. Ser
geant Ellis taking his place. With the
confession of Ellis as a basis, the
Grand Jury "finds that grafting has
been going on in Chinatown for a long
time and virtually accuses the ser
geant with bribe taking;
"I began raiding the games as soon
as I was assigned to Chinatown," ex
plained Christiansen yesterday, "and
in three weeks they got out a writ of
injunction against me. Resorting to
argument, why should the gamblers
pay me money for protection when my
hands were tied by the injunction? I
never took a dishonest cent in my life.
The Chinese I never approached me
with offers because they knew I was
not that kind of a man. I have al
ways heard of the sack in Chinatown,
but as I was never on the hunt for it
those who held it never bothered me.
"The injunction that stopped me
from raiding the fantan and lottery
games was in force for a month after
I was taken from Chinatown and sent
to the Southern district. It looks to
me as if the writ was raised as soon
p.s it was ascertained that immunity
could be purchased from the police.
"I think that Ellis' statement about
me Is the dirtiest thing he has done.
It is absolutely without foundation
and he has recklessly sought to be
smirch my reputation.
"I was before the Grand Jury as a
witness, but I could tell them nothing
more than the rumors I had heard of
the existence of a corruption fund in
Chinatown. Then they inquired
searchingly into my private affairs.
They asked me how much money I
had In the bank and what property I
owned. I did nok know what they
were driving at, but I was frank about
everything. I had nothing to conceal
Trom the Grand Jury nor from any
one else."
Christiansen lias been a member of
the department for fifteen years. He
was made a sergeant in 1894.

CALL, BUREAU, POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON, Feb. 6.â City Attor
ney Percy V. Long of San Francisco
visited the President to-day and laid
before him at length the needs of the
city in the matter of a water supply
and the efforts being made to meet
them. The President is perfectly fa
miliar with the Yosemite National
Park and Long found it easy to ex
plain the whole situation to him. while
he also found the President a ready
and interested listener.
A bill permitting the city to take
water from a reservoir in Yosemite, at
Lake Eleanor and Hetch-Hetchy Val
ley, has reposed in the Public Lands
Committee for a long time. Needham
is a member of that eomittee and he is
opposed to the bill on the ground that
the proposed use of the water would
divert it from the valleys of his district,
where his constituents need it for ir
rigation purposes. Long showed the
President that no injury would follow
to agriculture from the diversion of the
comparatively small flow of water,
while the needs of San Francisco were
paramount and imperative.
The President gave Long a letter to
Commissioner of Forestry Pinchot.
with a request that the latter go into
the situation thoroughly and report to
him. Long will see Pinchot to-moirow.
MANY HARBORS
CLOSED BY ICE
BOSTON, Feb. 6.â Nearly all of the
smaller ports on the New England
Coast between Passamaquoddy and
Narragansett bays are closed to-night
tightly with ice, while the larger har
bors, including Boston, Portsmouth,
Portland and Providence, are filled
with huge floating cakes that impede
and endanger navigation. The south
east storm and rising temperature that
prevailed during the day caused a tem
porary lifting of the ice embargo at a
few of the .blockaded ports, but to
night the wind changed to the north
west, a cold wave approached and it is
expected that to-morrow would bring
about conditions even worse than
those which have existed for the past
three days.
BALTIMORE. Feb. 6.â The ice em

TREATMENT OF PILES.
Permanence of Core the True Test.
Many so-called pile remedies will
afford the user slight temporary relief
and the majority of those afflicted do
not expect more than this.
The average sufferer, after having
tried every preparation recommended
for the cure of piles, comes to the con-
clusion that there is no cure except
an operation and rather than undergo
this "last resort" he suffer on, re-
signed to the situation, so far ;is may
be. The attention of those interested
is invited to the following expert*
"After ten years of suffering from

and after using every remedy I could
! hear of without any benefit, I finally
bought a fifty-cent box of Pyrunid
Pile Cure and used it with such
result* I bought a dollar box, which
finished up the job. That was nearb
six years ago and aa far as piles is
concerned I am cured and have never
felt a symptom of them since.
"Many others have used this ren
by my advice with the same result*
and I always recommend it to suf-
ferers with piles." â C. H. Potts, Bur-

and untarnished members of the Com

any of the accused Senators, except

committee, and said that no- one bad

tee. The three Senators 'named caused
a sensation by testifying to the meth
ods of French Wright. Bunkers and
Emmons in the committee. They said
they were aware of a great deal that
â¢was groing on in that body and that
they attended but few meetings.
The four accused men were always
present when any of the other members

Investigated could only be decided after
the testimony had been taken.
Attorney Cator announced that he
â¢would put the four accused Senators
on the stand to-morrow night, and
hoped to close his case in about two
hours at that time. The committee ex
pressed a desire to have William Cor
bln before it again to-morrow night.
A remarkable state of affairs was
presented to-night whtn tho Sefense

the witnesses for the defense had noth

If ON s| \\i).
It was then announced that Senator
EL J. Welch of San Francisco wished to
make a statement. Senator Welch in
iormed the committee that he desired
to call to its atetntion an untrue state
ment in a San Francisco paper, to the
effect that he had been seen with Mar
tin Kelly and one or two of the ac
cused Senators on X street a few min
utes prior to the time it is alleged Em
nions was paid by Jordan.
He said he met Joseph EL Jordan
and Senator Emmons on X street, near
Tenth, ajid they hailed him and asked
where he was gtflng. He said he was
going to dinner at a club of which he
is a member, the club being located at
1103 Eighth street. Jordan asked Sen
ator Emmons if he did not want to
take a look through the club, and Em
mons assenting they walked up X
street to Eighth, turned down and en
tered th<" club. Emmons and Jordan
looked around a few minutes and then
Welch escorted them to the door and
they i-ft. walking toward X street.
Welch then enjoyed his supper and
thought no more of the Incident until
it was testified by the detectives that
after leaving the club Jordan and
French walked to X street, turned
down and when they had passed tlie
corner about forty feet they stopped
snd Jordan handed Emmons a roll of
greenbacks.
Senafr Welch said he had no apology
to make for his meeting with these
men, as it was only an incident that
occurs numberless*- times each day in
the life of every, busy man.
JORDAN lÂ» I\Â« t SKI>.
At the request of Attorney c T.
Jon*>s sf â acrassesto Jo* ph Jordan
x< used as a witness until to-mor
row nipht.
H. P. Dooer was the first witness in
troduced by the defense to Impeach
the character of the witnesses that
have entered for the prosecution. Dooer
declared that he would not believe
Henry Hartling, the detective employed
by the prosecution, under oath.
Charles P. Fox <.f Bakersfield also
: : ling a bad character. R L.
Brundage. Assessor of Bakersfield,
vsid that hp would not believe Hart
ling under oath.
Attorney McNab f<Â»r the prosecution
brought out thr fact iha| the three
â  -ses had onl- known Hartling
detective for Haggin & Tevis in
the Bakersfield fi^amu land cases.
It was further brought out that
Hartling had posed as a settler when
â  r developed that he was a detec
tive for the land owners.
F. H. Fogarty, a business man of
Bakersfield, was next called to the
>iand. He gave Hartling and George
M. Tichenor bad reputations for truth
and veracity. He said he had heard
that Hartling: had posed as a swamp
land settler when, according to the
witness, he was a "spy.' Fogarty
said he based his opinion on public
sentiment.
Another witness who gave Detective
Hartling a bad reputation was Myron
Holmes, -who has been a resident of
â¢sfiel^ for the last fourteen years.
Attorney McNab brought out the fact
'hat all Holmes had known of H;irt
\lng was based on the Bakersfleld
mamp land cases.
J. W. Jcun^soT;. a manufacturer of
hapi. sprang a sensation when
Emitted he had known Detective
nor. but that the latter had
:ound him to be a man who had
â¢^hot at two men during trouble over
â¢ oil claim.
I. Dunlap, a railroad conductor
f Bakersfield. said Tichenor"s repu
tatfoa was "very bad." The witness
admitted that he had participated in
booting during the oil land trou-
Me. The fact was brought forth that
mooting was done v in April, 1901.
Dunlap h*d heard that Tichenor had
been a Pullman conductor and that he
had been discharged by the railroad.
Dunlap admitted that he had been
placed under bonds after the shooting
during the oil land trouble.
Hartling and Tichenor were also
civen a bad reputation by Policeman
M Tibbetts of Bakersfleld.
McNab again connected Hartling and
Tichenor as detectives in the swamp
land and oil cases.
"The general opinion imong the offi
cers of Bakersfleld," stated Tibbetts,
was that they would swear to any
Special Dispatch to The Call.
kind of evidence." The witness also
accused Hartling of killing cattle on
disputed land.
John F. Dooley, a miner who had
been one of the Bakersfleld swamp set
tlers, and, James A. Bernard of Kern
were witnesses who also testified
against the detectives-employed by the
prosecution.
At this Juncture Senator Simpson of
the Senatorial committee of Inquiry
moved that the number of character
witnesses <>n each side be limited to
twenty persons.
The defetise objected on the ground
that three nights had been occupied by
the prosecution in putting in their
case. It was further stated by the at
torneys for the accused Senators that
outside of the character witnesses the
only persons who would be put on the
stand would be the accused men them
selves. The defense also made the plea
that they had already subpenaed wit
nesses who had come from a great
distance.
Senator Simpson advised that the
number of character witnesses be lim
ited to twenty-five persons.
NUMBER I.JMITED.
The number of witnesses on impeach
ment was finally fixed at twenty-five.
J. W. Briscoe of Bakersfield was then
withdrawn and C W. Cross of San
Francisco was w called. He said he had
resided in San FYaneiPeo seventeen
y^ars and before that time ten years in
Nevada Cttjr. He had known Detective
Hartling for twenty-two years. "In
Sierra County Hartling"s reputation
lor swearing falsely was as bad as a
man's could be," declared thr witness.
In answer to MoNab's questioning
rops declared that he never had a
controversy with Hartling. The wit
ness admitted that he had been attor
ney in a case at a time when Hartling
was the official Constable. He stated
that the case had_ gone against him and
that people had said: "Why did you
not buy Hartling for $10 to testify for
you?"
Further than that, said the witness.
Hurtling had come to his office with
propositions which compelled him
(Cross) to think him a bad character.
< "larence Gray, a San Francisco at
torney, save Hartling a bad reputa
tion. The witness once had the detec
tive arrested for slapping his Cace.
.1. S. Daly, a former sea captain of
San Fn:n<isco, who claimed a flight
acquaintance with Hartling, also gave
him a bad reputation.
Attorney McNab made a futile effort
to show that the witness had held a
conference irttn Senator French and
Joseph Jordan.
<OM>KTOR TALKS.
At this point the prof=Â»Â»cution brought
out an admission from the defense that
Witness Ciray had been tried but ac
quitted on a charge of manslaughter.

gave Detective Tk&enor a bad reputa

A motion to adjourn had been made
and the crowd was dispersing, when
< 'hail mat. Belshaw rapped for order
and attorneys and spectators took their
s^ats apain. President Anderson of the
Senate was called t<> the chair.
"Htre you any statement to make?"
asked Chairman Belshaw.
"I have." said Anderson, "but F pre
fer that you question me and I will
answer."'
Belshav, then read the rlau.gr in Cnr
affidavft in which it was statpd
that th" Examiner secured the ap
j'ointment of th< committee and asked
him if it was true.
KKADS AFFII>.\\ IT.
"Txt me see the affidavit," said An
derson, and he looked over % the para
graph himself.
"This committee was created by the
Committee on Rules. The committees
of th<* Senate this time are the same as
previously, only two new ones, those
of Revenue and Taxation and Public
Buildings and Grounds, being added.
No man ever asked me to place any
body on this Committee on Commis
sions and Retrenchment.
I pave no promise to any Senator
prior to the coming to Sacramento to
make committee appointments. The
first day I asked them to write their
preferences for committee assignents
on slips of paper. Many did and then
1 u.Â«^d my judgment, considering the
length of service, political affiliations
and occupations."
"Did any Senator request that you
put him on this committee?" asked Bel
shaw.
"I had just one such request," was the
reply, "it was from Senator Wright.
He wrote eight requests, drew a line
under them and added three more,
county government, irrigation and last
of all commissions and retrenchment.
That was the only written or reauest
of any kind that I had."
In answer to questions by McNab An
derson said that this is not a very de
sirable committee.
"There was nothing about this com
mittee that indicated the power it af
terward assumed." asked McNab.
"I understood," was the reply, "that
they were to consider what commis
sions were to be abolished and what to
be consolidated."
"On motion of Senator French addi
tional power was given, was it not?"
asked McXab.
SECRET MEETINGS.
On January 10 it was reported that
the committee had some work it wished
to prosecute. This was not designated,
but further power of eubpena and in
vestigation was given."
Continuing, Anderson said that it
was a problem to give all the Senators
an average of assignments. He did not
have enough for some of them and put
them on this committee.
"Without you being conscious of it,"
asked McNab, "and with various con- 1
versationg passing to and fro, would It
not be possible for certain people with
ulterior designs to get Bone the least
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 1905.
Important Senators on the least Impor
tant committee?"
"I don't think I was influenced in any
way," said Anderson. "There is al
ways danger that Senators will kick.
I got no kick from any one of the four
on this committee, but from one of the
other three."
"The accused four never objected,
then?"
"No," was the reply.
When asked by Nicol when he first
learned that this committee was trying
to investigate corporations, Anderson
said, "I didn't know much about it un
til you came walking down the center
aisle with yovir petition."
"Had it become a subject of discus
sion that this committee was meeting
secretly in a remote place?"
"I hadn't heard it."
"Do you know of any other commit
tee so' meeting?"
"No, sir."
Nicol then said that personally every
member of the counsel representing the
affiant. Corbin, thoroughly acquitted
Anderson of any design In appointing
the committee.
Senator Coggins, one of the three un
tarnished members of the Committee
on Commissions and Retrenchment,
was called as a witness by the investi
gating committee.
"I did not attend the first meeting or
two." he said. "'I was not present when
it decided to investigate building and
loan societies. The first meeting I was
present at the doors were closed. The
reason given was the committee did
not want the names of the people du
in? a legitimate business to be made
public. No parties were demanding a
hearing when this rule was made."
The witness said that Emmons seem
ed to be in favor of opening, the doors
when get-rich-quick parties were being
investigated. *
WAXTKD DOORS CIjOSED.
' Did Senators Bunkers, French and
Wright want closed doors?" was asked.
"I don't remember about Bunkers"
was the reply, "but French and Wright
wanted t*^m closed."
"1 was rot aware what the powers
of the committee were." said the wit
ness. "1 should not have undertaken
to include the duties assumed by it in
the committee. I objected to summon:
ing people indiscriminately."
"Didn't you, Bauer and Rambo unite
in protest?" asked Nicol.
\Y â¢ did," was the rejily.
As an instance of how much any of
the members but the four men accused
knew of what was going on in the com
mittee, Nicol brought out the state
ment from Coggins "that two young
men were before the committee but
never gave the name of the business
they were conducting."
Coggins said further that probably
Senator French mentioned investigat
ing the Continental. He was not pres
ent when they decided to subpena Cor
bin. He was never there when anybody
was subpenaed. he said.
"I never saw Jordan around the com
mittee," continued <'oggins. "I think
there was some talk at one meeting
about who would be snbpenaed, may
be about the Continental. I never saw
any written complrint against any in
stitution or anybody."
The witness admitted that the com
YOSEMITE BILL
IS UP AGAIN
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 6.â The op
ponents of the Yosemite and Mariposa
big tree grove recession biU, headed by
Ralston, took a new move in the pro
r-fedings to-day and Introduced a pro
posed constitutional amendment that if
carried will take recession out of the
hands of the Legislature and give thf
voters of the State opportunity to ex
press their views on the question at
the polls. The purpose of the proposed
amendment is to add a new section
to tbe constitution authorizing the Leg
islature to re-cede to the Federal Gov
ernment the tracts named, it being held
that the vote on this measure will be
an expression of public opinion on the
question the Legislature should have
before proceeding further.
There was a spirited debate this
afternoon over Prescott's joint resolu
tion requesting the Senators and Rep
resentatives of California -at Washing
ton to use. their influence to have the
question of the joint admission to
statehood of Arizona and New Mexico
submitted to the people of the two
Territories that they may determine by
ballot whether they desire to merge
their identity and become one State.
Senator Shortridge spoke at length in
favor of the resolution, saying that in
his opinion the people of these great
sections should be permitted to decide
this issue themselves. He was of the
opinion that Arizona should be ad
mitted alone.
Senator Wolfe presented a resolution
to-day he believes will have the effect
of delaying, at least till the next ses
sion of the Legislature, the considera
tion of the school fund apportionment
bill which is so strongly opposed by
San Francisco. Wolfe's resolution calls
upon State Superintendent of Schools
Kirk to inform the Senate on the fol
lowing Questions:
What was the total attendance of the gram
mar and primary schools of the State and in
the several counties for the year 1903-4?
What sum would be required. In addition to
that now expended, to Increase the school term
all over the State to a minimum of eljht
months? To nine months?
What additional money would be required
to increase the salaries of grammar and pri
mary school teachers of the State to thÂ« mini
mum respectively of $520. $560, $585 and $630
per year?
It is not believed that Kirk can
gather this information during the
present session and this will jrive Wolfe
and others that are fighting the resolu
tion an opportunity to argue that the
bill has been framed without due con
sideration and that pending the fullest
investigation no statute should be en
acted amendatory of the present law.
mittee, in deciding to investigate the
Continental, took its cue from the Ex
aminer.
BAUER A WITNESS.
Charles Vaughn, the stenographer
who is reporting the case of the ac
rused Senators, was the clerk of the
committee under fire, and he was or
dered to bring what notes he might
have â¢of the proceedings to-morrow
night.
Senator Bauer was the next witness.
He seemed anxious to give all the light
he could, and it was evident that he
was much chagrined at having been
connected with the committee.'
"I was unfamiliar with the early ac
tions of the committee," he said. "I
did not attend the meetings. There
was a full meeting when ;t was an
nounced that Corbin would be present,
but he did not come. There were two
press representatives present then,
and I made a motion that
all the press be admitted.
Wright proposed a substitute that
it be admitted to this particular
meeting. I said any honest concern
should not be afraid to show Itself In
the open. Enumms made the point
against me that if the concern under
investigation was good we should not
uo it any harm, but that if it was bad
it should be exposed. I attended only
three meetings. I got my first idea of
what was doinff when I saw in the Ex
aminer that the Realty Syndicate was
to be subpenaed."
T T nder Simmons' plans there would
have been closed doors all the time,
though Bauer did not state this point,
because it would be held that it could
not be determined whether a concern
was good <>r bad until after all the tes
timony had been taken.
BUNKERS KEEPS QI7IET.
Continuing about his attempt to
have open meetings of the committee,
Senator Bauer said that Bunkers was
chairman and said nothing during the
discussion. Bauer knew nothing about
who was to be investigated or why or
how. French. Bauer said, declared
that he (Bauer) was trying to clock
the proceedings of the committee. He
talked with Coggins and they decided
that the best thing to do was to hold
open meetings all the time so that the
press and the public would know what
was going on.
"How did the members vote on this
proposition?" asked Nicol.
"It never came to a. vote," said Bauer.
"Sometimes one can see tvhen one is
beaten."
"You saw you were beaten by these
four?"
"You bet. I did." answered Bauer.
"Were these four accused members
present at every meeting you attend
ed?"
"They were."
Senator Rambo, the third of the
minority members of the committee,
said he only attended two meetings
and was always in favor of open doors.
"I couldn't see why the Bardwell-
Ford Syndicate investigation should be
held with closed doors," he said, "be
cause the concern is a fraud on its
face. I know one of the men connected
with it and he couldn't be anything
that is straight."
When Senator Rambo left the stand
it was announced that an adjournment
would be taken until 3 o'clock to-mor
row afternoon.

and Regulations be instructed to Inves

The resolution was adopted. It is
stated by some members that the lower
house is three weeks behind in com
parison with the Senate and former
sessions.
There were thirty-seven members of
the Assembly present when the lower
house was called to order at 9:30 this
morning. A call of the house resulted
in the rounding up of five more mem

of Fresno, one of those who is in favor
of getting through as near the sixty

lution that the salaries of those who
had remained away without excuse be

The absentees came within two votes
of losing three days' pay, the resolution
being beaten by a vote of 22 to 20.
Drew announced that he would bring
the resolution up again to-morrow

tain ages and certain illiterate minors.
The bill has passed the Senate, having
been introduced there by Wolfe, and is
now ready to go to the Governor.
Without a dissenting voice being
raised the nine amendments to the
charter of the city of Los Angeles, in
cluding the famous one limiting fran
chises to 21 years, were adopted by the
Assembly.
VACATIONS FOR FIREMEN.
T*he arguments for and against the
one limiting franchises have produced
a great deal of commotion in Los An
geles. Charges have been freely made
there that efforts are being made to,
kill it in tho interests of corporations.
Another side of the case is represented
in the statement that its adaption
would work an injury to the pepple, as
it would prevent the building of new
electric roads and tend to strengthen
the monopoly of those existing.
The fight against this particular
amendment will be made in the Sen
ate, to which the erftire nine now go
fcr adoption. The other eight, it is
held, will go down with it if the one
limiting franchises is defeated.

WOULD PROTECT THE CIVIL SERVICE
SYSTEM BY AMENDING CONSTITUTION
Three Important Measures to Preserve
the Merit Pfan Are Introduced.
GUARD RIGHTS OF EMPLOYES
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. Â«.â Three pro
posed amendments to the constitution,
two of interest alone to San Francisco,
the other to the entire Sate, werÂ» in
troduced this afternoon by Senator
Belshaw at the Instance of the Com
monwealth Club of California, of which
H. Weinstock of Sacramento is the
president
One of the proposed amendments pro
vides for a liberal State civil service.
A second would amend the constitution
so as to remove the danger of sum
mary dismissal under which all civil
service men in San Francisco, includ
ing the members of the police and flre
departments, now rest. The constitu
tion gays that where no term Is ex
pressed employes ahall hold office at
pleasure, and that in no event shall the
term exceed four years unless other
wise provided by the constitution. It
Is to prevent the invalidation of char
ter amendments and subsequent re
moval of employes that this proposed
amendment is designed.
The third amendment puts the so
called county offices in the same cate
gory as the city offices, and extends the
civil service to the County Clerk's of
fice, the Sheriff's office and the As
sessor's office.
The constitutional amendment ere*
ating a State civil service was passed
by the Assembly two years ago, but
was defeated in the Senate.
THREE AMENDMENTS.
The proposed amendments are as fol
lows:
Se. . 8>;. Whenever a city and county gov
ernment has been merged and consolidated Into
one municipal government, it shall bo compe
tent In any charter framed under section 8 of
article 11 of this constitution to provide for the
uuaiitications of such city and county officers,
and of their deputies, assistants and employes,
and for tiie manner in which they shall be
appointed and removed, and any such provision
contained In any charter heretofore framed and
adopted under said section shall be valid.
Sec. 21. Whenever a city charter heretofore
or hereafter adopted provides for the methods
Ly which officials and employes shall be ap
pointed and removed, and wnenever the L#gl
islature provides by statute heretofore or here
after enacted the methods by which the ap
pointive officials and employes oi the State
shall be appointed or removed, such method
shall he followed by the officials who are given
the power of appointment or removals by said
charter or statutes; and their acts shall not
be subject to review by any other tribunal than
those named by such charters or statutes, but
shall be final as to all questions of appoint
ment or removals, whether of jurisdiction or
otherwise.

of four days each month for all firemen
was passed.
When the time for the afternoon ad
journment arrived Atkinson of San
Francisco moved that a night session
be held. This motion was carried, but
not enough appeared to-night to carry
on business. It has been the contention
of those who want Saturday adjourn
ments that the loss of time would be
more than made up for by night ses
sions and that the clerks need Satur
day to check up their work.
A petition against the adoption of the
proposed amendment to the charter of
the city of Los Angeles, limiting the
life of franchises to twenty-one years,
was presented to the Senate to-day. It
is signed by a large number of promi
nent business men and firms of that
city.

Bpartal Dispatch to The Call.
AUBURN, Feb. 6.â The trial of
Adolph Weber, accused of the murder
of his mother, Mary Weber, began this
morntng. The' 'feature of the day was a
visit to the ruins of the Weber home.
Judge Prewett, the jury and the attor
neys on both sides and the prisoner
viewed 'the scene of the awful tragedy.
AdoJpb Weber's composure during the
trip was most remarkable. As "*.<=â  en
tered the grounds where once had stood
the pretty Weber home he raised his
handkerchief to his eyes ar â  kept it
there for several seconds. As the silent
visitors passed to the front of the
Weber house where the terribie tragedy
had been enacted, Adolph turned his
back upon the ruins of his old home
and leaned against the basement walL
He was yery pale. During the visit

sworn in and gave the Jurors the cus
tomary advice to abstain from intoxi
cants while the case ie pending. ' Attor
ney General U. S. Weob made the
opening statement for the prosecution.-
He gave a full account to the Jury of
the terrible tragedy of .November 10.
He said In part:
\'Juryrnen, you will understand that
the evidence offered before you will be
entirely of a circumstantial nature. We j
will bring before you a. number of sep- i
arate facts, which will mate a chain
of evidence on which yam will, .base *

Weber. the mother, wu murdered by
her first born, her ena, who Kits there
before you, and we Ehall also chow you
that at the Bame time the other mem- I
bers of the family also were killed- We
Fhall produce before y*ou evidence
Ehovi-lngr that death came to them'
through a 22-caliber revolver. We shall
show you that the defendant immedi
ately after he had commjtted this.ter
rible crime rushed into <he American
Hotel and was ir. the act of washing
his hands when he suddenly discovered
that* there was another. occupant in the
room. He rushed out without shutting
oft* the water and drying- his hands. --.
"We" shall also show you his entire
course after he left the -hotel until he
came tb the scene of the fire. We shall
show you 'how he stood in front of his
burning home and saw the burning
bodies of his mother and sister carried
out; saw his little brother,. Earl, still
alive, rescued from the flames â
without offering a helping hand, or in
the slightest degree showing any inter
est in them.* We' will show you how he
stood there during the midst of this
terrible excitementâ when the bodies
were laid upon the ground, when wom
en were fainting and tears were in the
eyes of every man who saw the ghastly
spectacle, calm as if he was witnessing
a play which he Jiad often seen played
I before. He calmly looked upon 'the
! body of his mother whose sightless eyes
I were turned toward heaven, but never
I for an instant did he proffer any as
| sistance. ' ;: - â¢ , - - ... , '
"The property of â  the ' Webers is
| worth $50,000 or more, and the defend
| ant sitting here is the sole survivor,
and as such the sole inheritor of the
; Weber wealth.' j , j -
"We will show you that the defend
: ant on the night of that tragedy, when
he ieft his home, took an entirely dif
â¢ ferent course to reach town' from the
: course which he outlined when he gave
his testimony before the Coroner's
Jury."
Attorney General Webb closed his
statement to the jury by announcing
that he had other evidence to intro
duce in the course of the trial.
DIMAXU OF JOHNSON.
Attorney Grove L. Johnson, for the
defense, asked the court to compel the
ution to give the facts withheld
and which they intended to use later,
in order that the defense may be in a
position to meet them. The Judge,
however, overruled the request of the
defense.
The first witness called was L. F.
Warner, County Surveyor, who testi
fied mainly to the blue print maps that
had been distributed to the Jury at the
opening of the case. Three of these
blue prints showed the Weber home,
the Weber barn where the pistol was
found and the general location of the
hill on which the property was situ
ated. The fourth map shows the town
of Auburn and the hill over which
Adolph Weber walked on the night* of
the tragedy. This ended the morning
.on.

exception to the admission as evidence

court visit the baA. Judge Prewett at
once acted uhon this suggestion and
ordered the jury, the attorneys con
â¢l, the prisoner. Sheriff- Coroner
and Court Stenographer Adams to at
PBpeeed to the scene of the trag
edy. Following the advice of the
rourt, it was decided to go over the
exact route which Adolph'Weber swore
before the Coroner's Jury he had taken
on the night of the murder.
Shortly before 3 o'clock, headed by
Judge I'rewett himself, the party left
the courthouse. Immediately behind
the Judge came the twelve jurors.
With them was Attorney Fred P. Tut
tle, who described the different places
along the route. Behind the jurors
came the other attorneys interested.
Adolph Weber, in the custody of Un
der Sheriff William I. May. Sheriff
Keena and Coroner Shepard came next
walking side by Bide. In the wake of
the Dffieers and prisoner were promi
nent men of the town and many others.
SOLEMN PROCESSION.
As the solemn procession passed out
of the courthouse down the hill to Main
street, where they went to view Co
hen's store! crowds of people rushed to
v.indows and sidewalks to see' what
was going on. The news spread like
wildfire that Adolph was in the streets
of the city once more, and from all
points people came to take a iook at
him. He was the cynosure of all eyes.
Business in the town was temporarily
suspended as the procession passed
quietly on its way through the ttvn.
Leaving the main portion of the town
the party slowly passed up Brewery
lane", past the. brewery and then up to
the ruins of the Weber home. They
were led by Attorney Tuttle about the
ruins. He pointed out to them the dif
ferent points where the bodies 'of the
Weber family were found.
The scene was a solemn one. Stand
ing back and away from the visiting
party were the sisters and nieces of the
murdered woman. They were dressed
in deep black and stood with heads
bowed.
The day w-as still and calm and only
the voice of Attorney Tuttle, who was
explaining the situation, broke the si
lence. After viewing the ruins the
court passed slowly and silently down
the hill and over the grassy sward to
the Weber barn, where the bloody pis
tol was found and where the $ssoo in
gold was also, discovered. From there
they proceeded to the Henney house,
and then across to College lane and
back to the courthouse. They had cov
ered the exact route that Adolph Weber
stated he had run over on the night of
the tragedy.

OF MONUMENTS
Thus Asserts Unitarian Pas
tor in Quaint Discourse
to His New Jersey Flock
PAVEMENT YARN FALSE
Satan's Tribnte to Aban

blazoned on Large Columns
Boeclai Diroatch to The Call.
ELIZABETH, N. J., Feb. 6.âThe
Unitarian congregation of All Koulh
Church last evening listened U> M
quaint discourse by* its paator, lu-.v.
Arthur H. Grant, on 'Oj)jreamland, or a :
visit to Hell. " Mr. Grant said:
"I was met qn my arrival by an old '
man with keen, bright eyes, who acted
as my guide and told me later he 1 wan
Satan.' The place contained many
monuments dedicated to men and wo
men of this earth. One monument
was of a woman and a child, with fig
ures emblematic of law and Justice.
This was dedicated to a lawyer called
William Cady, who started to devote
his life to the care of the poor and
the oppressed and to accord them Jus
; tice. On the reverse side of the jjionu
' ment an inscription said: 'He found
; that the corporations paid better than
the widows and orphans, so he became
an oppressor of the poor.'
'An imposing monument waa like a
mausoleum with four figures, three of
which were Industry, Justice and L*>ve.
The name on it was James Fenwick.
My friend said he was one of the
greatest reformers. He had thought
it ail out and was going to devote his
1 life to humanity and show the better
way to live; industry waa to take the
place of war, justice replace injustice
and love be the crown of life. This
man, however, spent his life sitting on
a barrel in a crossroads store, whit
tling, and was buried in a pauper's
grave.
"There was no monument to Wash
ington or Lincoln, but a particularly
fine lot dedicated to politicians. The
Inscriptions were nearly all alike â "I
am going to serve my country,' and on
reverse, I think it better to have my
country serve me."
"In the poets' corner, I saw a beau
tiful ideal of Lord Byron.
"I began to see what people meant
when they say: Hell is paved with
good intentions.' My friend said: 'I j
don't know anything about pavements, â 
but these are monuments to good in- â¢
tentions and this is Hell. They call me
Satan; of old they called the ac- !
cuser. I keep these monuments well
kept and the grass green; it is the best
kept cemetery in the universe. Each
man, according to his ideals, stands
out great and strong, and he can see
his monument to what he might have ;
been.'
"I didn't ask if tliere was a monu- j
ment to me; I wanted to get away.
Sttan was not what I expected to find;
he was simply one who stands out
against man and in the court of the
Most High pleads against men for their
higher accomplishments."

SWINDLING IS ALLEGED
Lake City Man Announces
That He Will Eesist At

CHICAGO, Feb. 6.â Charles F. Tay
lor, business partner of Mrs. Alice
Webb Duke, was arrested at his office
here to-day, charged with being a fu
gitive from Justice. He is alleged to
have been implicated in a swindle at
Nacogdoches, Texas, involving $3000.
Taylor says he will make a fight
against extradition.
NEW YORK, Feb. 6.â When Mrs.
Erodie L. Duke was arraigned in the
Police Court to-day for her adjourned
examination it developed that the
Texas authorities had not, as had been
reported, given up their intention of
obtaining her extradition to that State.
Just before court opened District At
torney Jerome received the following
message :
STATE CAPITOL, AUSTIN, Tex.. Feb. Â«.
1900. â Application for a . requisition for Alice
Webb, wanted in Nacogdoches County, . Texas,
for swindling, has beÂ«n received by me and re
turned to thÂ« officers of Nacogdoches' County
for correction. ' Will |be forwarded as soon aa
papers are made out properly. â 
<Slgne<J) S. W. T. LA.VHAM, Governor.
Counsel for Mrs. Duke tried to obtain
her release on parole, but the represen
tative of the District Attorney would
not agree. After hearing the argument
on that point Magistrate Poole said:
There is something queer about this whole
case. It looks as tf the Texaa authorities
have been trifling with the District Attorney's
office here. It is fifteen days since Mrs. Duke
was arrested and we have heard nothing ;
definite from them.
The magistrate granted an adjourn
ment until to-morrow and Mrs. Duke
was returned to the Tombs. When she
was being conducted back to the prison
she collapsed in a faint in the corridor
outside the courtroom and was carried
across the "bridge of sighs" to her cell.
MEN IN SHOPS
COMPLIMENTED
Divine Sees Intelligence
in Faces of All Railroad
Employes at Sacramento
Socialistic tendencies as found among
the working classes and the^tondition
of the less fortunate of the land were
some of the problems considered by the
Rev. H. C. Morrison, the noted Ken
tucky minister and evangelist, before
1 a large body of Methodist preachers at
their weekly meeting yesterday. The
speaker considered the subject with
great earnestness and laid particular
stress upon what he called the neces
sity for the church to come into close
touch with the "unchurched-"
He described the men he had found
in the railroad shops at Sacramento,
eaying that he had not encountered a
weak, stupid or uninteresting face
among them. Every man, he said,
looked serious and fntelligent, many
having heads and faces that would be
a credit to United States Senators. By
way of parenthesis, he hoped that their
morals were better than some United
States Senators'. He said that the
great mass of worklngmen think seri
ously, and need only stalwart, con
scientious men to direct them rightly.
When they saw millionaires planning
to corner meat, and on the other hand
saw a starving woman singing a lul
laby to a baby and unable to buy a
steak for their own sustenance to en
able her to nourish the infant, they felt
the necessity of doing something to
counteract such evils. The greed of
men having more money than they
pould count and still eager to make
more was sure to make the strong,
burly will of the masses rise in rebel
lion.
Mr. Morrison felt that the clergy
should preach in the shops and get in
touch with the masses, but not neces
sarily to abuse the classes. To reach
the masses they should resort to thÂ«>
newspapers, to pamphlets, advertising
and even brass bands. There are men,
he said, of Socialistic tendencies who
are drifting toward anarchy, but if
reached their influence could be turned
to the building up of society.
Among the practical needs of to-day
was the regulation of transportation
companies. Men, women and children,
he said, were suffering for fruit. There
were children who never had a whole
orange, while oranges were left to rot
on the ground In California because of
the exorbitant railway tolls.
Dr. W. C. Pond spoke before the Con
gregational Ministers' Association yes
terday on % 'Work Among the Chinese

DELMAS OPENS
DRAMATICALLY
Attorney for Proponents in
Yoell Will Contest Be
gins in Startling Manner
An artistic and effective bit of melo
drama, introduced by Attorney D. M.
Delmas, enlivened the Yoell case yes
terday. When the contestants rested
their case in the morning Delmas rose
and gave an eloquent sketch of J. Alex
ander Yoell's career.
At the close of the peroration he sud
denly said: "I will call as a witness
the leader in the assault on his father's
character."
Turning to where John H. Toell sat,
Delmas pointed to him and said, "Take
the stand, Mr. Yoell."
"Very dramatic," remarked Yoell
quickly.
Delmas caught the attention of the
gathering in Judge Kerrigan's court
and held it till the last dramatic sen
tence was spoken.
Sensational charges were hinted at in
the attorney's speech. Mr. Delmas said:
The task before me is a painful one, but I
could not evade a trust reposed in me by the
â¢ I ji. We intend to show no bitternebs or
resentment, but we shall proceed without fear.
It some of the blows aimed at the man who
did so much for his children recoil upon his
assailants theirs is the blame, not mine.
The whisper that a sensation was to
be sprung by the proponents in the
afterno-on drew crowds to the court
room. The testimony was not of such
a startling kind as was expected. Ru
mor says the heaviest bolt of the prose
cution is held back for to-day.
Evidence intended to show that the
pioneer's resentment against his son,
J<-hn H. Yoell, had some foundation,
was introduced. Letters from a young
er son, William Yoell, assailing the
elder brother's character, were read.
This letter from this member of the
family declared that bis sisters were
told and proud and that "Johnnie,"
his brother, was the cause of all the
family trouble. The letter runs:
I am sorry that you are so unhappy and
that your children are cold and proud when
they come to see you. 1 can't understand
who it was that brought the girl* up that
way. Whenever any little boy came to play
with me my mother w>uld aak who his peo
ple were or If they had money. It was the
same way with my sinters. They wert alwaya
cold and proud to me. I never had a sister's
love or advice.
When I was home. If I knew these things.
1 would have acted differently. I treated both
you and my mother badly. I wa* only a
headstrong boy.
In another letter William Yoell writes
ot his brother Herbert, saying:
Herbert is here. I do not want my wife
to meet htm. I do not think him flt to meet
her. He waa living with a woman here. He
has treated me shamefully and wrote a letter
to mamma with a lot of lies about me. Be
cause I owed him a little money he went to
my employer and tried to get my salary. He
let me eat at his house once and charged me
for the meals. Nice, brotherly conduct,
wasn't it?
Johnnie is at the bottom of all your troubles.
Mamma ought to have learned that he was
her evil genius. I believe thaCyou have acted
nobly and that you are not as black as you
are painted. Though you suffer from the
wrongs and sins of your children, remember
you have one son who loves you.
A shaft leveled at John Yoell in one
of the letters caused a titter of amuse
ment. It was an attack on higher edu
cation. "At college, boys are taught to
smoke and drink." declares William. "I
never knew a college man who amount
ed to anything."
Delmas brought out the fact that the
Yoell children had all received good
educations. John H. Yoell was on the
stand most of the day, and at times
displayed evidence of a ruffled temper.
The introduction of William Yoeirs let
ters was strenuously objected to by
the contestants.
The case will be resumed at 10:30 to
day.

MINERS' STRIKE
MAY SOON END
Some Have Already Resumed
Work and a Vote Will Be
Taken Thursday in Essen
PROPOSED LAW FAVORED
Government Plans by a New
Statute to Bring About
Better Conditions for Men
ESSEN. Feb. 6.â The committee of I
1 seven to-day addressed a telegram to ,
] the Mine Owners' Association, politely [
asking an interview for a discussion of â 
i the five points in the operatives' de
mands which the committee believed
I would lead to a resumption of work.
The association replied with equal po
liteness, declining to receive the com
mittee, alleging that it did not repre
sent the operatives, since it was un
able to control their actions. The as- |
sociation was willing only to discuss :
reasonable complaints after work was ,
resumed.
After getting this reply, Johann Ef
fert,chairman of the committeeof seven,
telegraphed to Chancellor yon Bulow,
informing him of the fruitless corre- ;
spondence with the association, mak
ing certain moderate demands for the
operatives, and stating that the work I
would perhaps be commenced imme- '
diately if conferences were commenced.
The Chancellor answered that if work |
were resumed he would receive repre- (
sentatives of the operatives and em
ployers for further negotiations.
The committee decided that it was
unable to advise the miners to resume,
but would leave the matter to the con- '
ference of delegates of the whole mm- '
ing district, which w ill meet on Thurs- '
day.
BERLIN, Feb. 6.â Two or three
thousand coal miners who struck in the ;
Silesian district returned to work to- 'â 
day, believing that the Government's
bill now in preparation will readjust
their relations with their employers.
The Governments proposed law limits
the working day to :.ine hours in gal
teriea where the temperature is about i
70 degrees Fahrenheit, including the
time going in and coming out of the
mines. In temperatures of 84 degrees
Fahrenheit and higher only a six-hour
day is permitted. Within two or three
years the nine-hour day is to be short
eaed to eight and one-half hours. :
About nine-tenths of the miners of
Germany come within these provisions.
Overtime will be paid for at the high
est rate.
Workmen's committees shall be rec- â 
ognized by mine owners as represent
ing the men. Making the present con
dition of the miners worse in any par- '
ticular than it is now is forbidden
("HAHLEROI, Belgium. Feb. 6.â As ;
a result of the decision 'of the miners' |
congress yesterday to declare a gen
eral strike to begin to-day, work' was
completely suspended this morning at
eight collieries and there was a partial
strike at thirteen others. Work is pro- '
ceeding as usual at twelve collieries.
OFFICIALS FORCED TO MARCH.
Oipturcd by Strikers and Cilveii a
IMnce In Parade.
BERLIN. Feb. 6.-The Lokal An
zeigers correspondent at Kattowitz
telegraphs: 4
"A state of siege h,as been declared at
Sosnovicc, General Jedczynski taking
command. The superintendent of police
has been dismissed from office. Gath
erings of as many as three persons on
the streets are forbidden. The military
are using their arms at the slightest
disobedience of orders. The tearing
down of placards announcing the state
of siege is punished with ten days' im
prisonment. Serious collisions are ex
pected. The strikers have abundant
supplies of dynamite and hand bombs.
The exodus of Germans by rail is very
heavy. Germans arriving at Sosnovice
are advised by the authorities to re
main at the railway station for safety.
"The procession of strikers at Sosno
vice. estimated at SO.OOO persons, con
tained a number of German mining of
ficials, whom the strikers had acptured
and compelled to march in their ranks.
The Russian industrial district along
the frontier is suffering great financial
losses through the strike. It is esti
mated that $5,000,000 of German capital
is employed at Sosnovice."
The Tageblatt's Kattow ttz corre
spondent reports that 1500 soldiers have
marched into Sosnovice under two gen
erals and that important events are
impending.
The Vossische Zeitung's correspond
ent at Kattowitz says:
"Three agitators were arrested at
Sosnovice on Saturday for distributing
revolutionary appeals to the soldiers.
One of the men arrested is a German.
Thousands of leaflets were seized in
their rooms."
Under date of February S the Vos
sische Zeitung's correspondent at Czest
chowa sends the following:
"The military are taking sharp meas
ures against the populace. Many sol
diers and police have already been
killed. Some high officers have been ar
rested for plotting against the' Gover
nment. The people are living in extreme
excitement and great fear. Many have
fled to foreign countries. There have
been a number of dynamite explosions
caused by the Socialists, but they have
failed to do much damage. Th% schools
have been closed."

WILL NOT AWAIT REINFORCEMENTS
Departure of the Third Squadron
Postponed Until the End of May
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 6.â The
dockyard authorities at Kronstadt are
completing the preparations for active
service of the battleship Alexander 11,
the cruisers Pamyat Azova and Ad
miral Komiloff and the gunboat Groz
jastchy, which, with the new battle
ship Slava, will form the second di
vision of the third Russian Pacifip
squadron. These reinforcements are
expected to sail at the end of May.
The Admiralty confirms the press
statement that the first division of this
squadron will leave Libau in the middle
of February, but it is pointed out that
Admiral Rojestvensky will be unable
to await its arrival, because he will
have to cross the Indian Ocean before
the monsoon season, which begins in
March and renders navigation impos
sible for torpedo-boats, small cruisers
and coast defense vessels. Admiral
Rojestvensky will proceed to the Far
East at the end of February.
Military operations in Manchuria are
at a standstill. No importance is at
tached by the War Office to the Jap
anese movements on the Russian cen
ter and left, which are regarded as
merely demonstrations.
General Heiesman. a war critic, ex
presses the opinion that the Russians
are not likely to surrender the positions
captured northeast of Sandepas and
that a series of encounters there will
continue until the weather is favorable
for a general advance.

The Japanese have lately shown
feverish activity in the construction of

GRIPENBERG DISOBEYS ORDERS.
Sacrifice uf Thousands of Men the
< ;>use of Ills Recall.
ST. PETERSBURG. Feb. 6â The
press is authorized to announce that
not the slightest information has been
received at the War Office regarding
the alleged illness or resignation of
General Kuropatkin. On the contrary,
the War Offices information indicates
no change whatever in the headquar
ters- staff in Mam-hurta. an., that the
departure of General Gripenberg for
St. Petersburg is due to illness.
The version of the departure of Gen
eral Gripenberg now given in the best
informed official circles is that the gen
eral left the front because he exceeded j
General Kuropatkin's orders in push- j
ing beyond Sandenas and needlessly â ,
sacrificed thousands of men. This led j
Kuropatkin to demand Gripenberg's re- I
call.
Telegraphing under date of February i
3 General Kuropatkin reports as fol- j
lows:
"A Russian detachment marched to
Santaitso. twelve miles southwest of
Sibonbay. The Japanese at Santaitse
and Saodameng were repulsed. The
Russian losses were insignificant.
"The Japanese assumed the offensive j
along the line to Chuanchuantse to- j
day. Several of their batteries ad
vanced, but the Russian artillery re
pulsed them."
DIPLOMATS IX A FLUKRY.
Disturbed by I)iirniurÂ« Xight Call at
the White House.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 6. â Because
Sir Mortimer Durand. the British Em- |
bassador. in response to an invitation :
from the President, accompanied !
Spring-Rice, the first secretary of the j
British embassy at St. Petersburg, to '
the White House last night for an i
Informal chat, the diplomatic corps j
was ago? to-day over the supposed !
significance of the conference.
An eanly caller at the State Depart
ment to-diiy was Takahira. the Jap- i
anese Minister, who spent some time !
with Secretary Hay. The hesitancy
with which the Minister replied to the ;
question us to whether peace pro- |
posals were in the air contributed to 1
the suspicions already afloat that this j
Government was contemplating a step j
toward int?rvention. Later in the day j
came Count Cassinl, the Russian Em- j
bassador. The Embassador received 1
the most positive and categorical as- j
surances that this Government was I
not exchanging any ideas with any \
Government regarding the ending of I
the war and that the conference at
the White House was without political
significance.
TELEGRAPH KEPT BUSY.
Russian Government Uses Siberian
Line for Eight Hours.
LONDON. Feb. 7. â Much specula- j
tion has been caused here by the fact !
that the Russian Government on Mod- j
day assumed control of the Siberian
telegraph lines from 8 o'clock in the !
morning until 4 o'clock in the after- i
noon. It is said to be the first occasion !
on which telegraph communication
has been stopped since the war began. ,
Various possible causes are discussed, '
such as the strike movement on the Si- !
bcrian railway and important corre
pendence with General Kuropatkin.
Little attention is paid to rumors of
peace mediation, but the Chronicle's !
St. Petersburg correspondent sends !
the statement (which, however, is not j
confirmed in other dispatches) that '
tho recent conferences of the Grand i
Ducal party to consider the far East- '
em prospects arrived at an agreement !
as to the desirability of ending the I
war and that the rumor of General i
Kuropatkin's resignation was started J
to facilitate negotiations for peace.
MAY LEARN FROM JAPANESE.
Dr. Seaman Argues for Improvement
in Medical Corps.
WASHINGTON, Feb. Â«.â Dr. L. L.
Seaman was heard to-day by the
House Committee on Military Affairs
on a project to increase the efficiency
of the medical department of the
army. Dr. Seaman has recently re
turned from an observation tour with
the Japanese army and his compari
son of sanitation and medical methods
between the Japanese and American
armies was embodied in these words:
"They go us a million times better
in sanitation and military supplies."
He said that but 1 per cent of sick

small merchants, and much of the

European nation.

DEBATE ENDED
ON STATEHOOD
Beveridge Makes the Closing
Argument for the Bill on
the Floor of the Senate
SPEAKS THREE HOURS
He Favors Tnion of Arizona
and New Mexico, and Okla
homa and Indian Territory
WASHINGTON, Feb. Â«. â The long
drawn out general debate on the bill
creating two States out of the Terri
tories of Oklahoma. Indian Territory,
New Mexico and Arizona was con
cluded to-day with a speech by Bev
eridge of Indiana, which consumed
the greater part of the day's session.
He reviewed the principal argruments
in opposition to the bin, giving special
attention to the proposition to unite
Arizona and New Mexico. He spoke
for almost three hours and closed amid
a cordial burst of applause from the
galleries.
Previous to Beverldge's speech For
aker spoke in support of his amend
ment to eliminate Arizona and New
Mexico from the proposition. The
only other important business of the
day wag the receipt of the House rep
lication to Judge Swayne's answer in
the impeachment trial.
Beveridge based his advocacy of
the statehood bill upon the theory
that Congress has absolute control of
the creation new States and in
elaborating he said the interests of the
nation as a whole were paramount to
the wishes of the people of the Terri
tories. He declared that the consti
tution gave Congress power to impose
any condition in such legislation and
quoted many precedents to show that
the tendency was toward large areaa
and extensive population in forming
new States which, he said, must be
the case in order to do justice to sis
ter States.
He contended that Arizona and New-
Mexico were similar in topography
and other circumstances and not nat
urally separated by a mountain range,
as had been aimed by some of the
opponents of the bill.
Beveridge contended that the cre
ation of Arizona Territory had not in
volved any contract to maintain the
boundary thus established and his ar
gument on this point caused an inter
ruption by Alger. who said that peo
ple who settled In Arizona had gone
there on a practical contract with the
national Government.
"If." he said. "The United States is
not going to keep its agreement, what
are v.-c here for?"
Beveridge replied that there was no
more reason why a perpetual pledge
should have been given to the people
of Arizona than to those of any other
Territory.
"No doubt." replied Alger. "the
Senator knows all that I know and
more, but I know that when I was in
Arizona I heard a number of men re
fer to the pledge in a way showing
perfect familiarity with it."
He added that he had become the
owner of considerable property in
Arizona, which he would sell in a
minute if the present bill should be
come a law.
The vote on the bill will take place
to-morrow.
A bill was passed adding to the
State of Arkansas a small strip of
land in Fort Smith, now in Indian
Territory.
Asked to Remain in Service.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 6. â Secretary
Morton to-day directed a letter to
Paymaster General H. T. B. Harris,
chief of the bureau of supplies and
accounts, informing him that, al
though his statutory retirement will
occur on March 10 next, it is the Gov
ernment's wish that he remain at the
head of the bureau for at least a year
after that date, in recognition of his
excellent administration.
WAIT IN VAIN
FOR THEIR SON
Disappearance of Wealthy
Klondiker Brings Sorrow
to Aired Couple in Fresno
PLAN A GLAD REI'XIOX
Willanl Akin Has Not Been
Seen Since He Boarded Ves
sel Bound for San Francisco
Special Dispatch to Th* Call.
FRESNO. Feb. Â«.-Wl!lard Akin, for
i many years a well-known man in this
city, has mysteriously disappeared.
[ More than a month ago he left Seattle
to return home, but from that time no
trace of his whereabouts has been dis
' covered. His parents, who are wealthy
! vineyardists of Oleander, have exhausi
1 ed every feasible means to learn some
thing of their absent son. but all to no
avail. The aged couple have not seen
their boy for many years, and while a
few weeks since they were exuberant
with Joy to find that he had decided to
return, now they are plunged in the
depth of gloom for fear that some dirÂ«
misfortune haa befallen him. He wu
well supplied with money and far from
despondent when last seen.
Seven years ago Willard Akin bad*
his parents farewell and set out to
amass wealth in the gold fields of the
Klondike. At first he met with but Mt
tle success, hut subsequently fortune
smiled upon his efforts and he found 14
spot near Valdez where the sands ran
rich with gold. He could not leave his
mining interests in the hands of other*,
and his parents, who are both octo
genarians, did not feel able to endure
the tiresome trip to the frozen north.
He wrote regularly, however, to tell
the loved ones of h(3 adventures and
his progress.
In November he sent word that h
had finally found time to come back to
Fresno and that he would leave Alaska
as soon as possible. Late in December
he wrote from Seattle that he w
sail next day for San Francisco on th~
Queen and that he would con
Fresno on the day after his arrival in
the metropolis.
Not a word has since been heard
from him. The Akin* noted the arrival
of the Queen and prepared to welcome
the long-absent son." Day after day
passed, and when he failed to appear
they became alarmed. Urgent mes
sages requesting Information were sent
out broadcast.
It was learned from the steamship
officials that the missing man rm<l
boarded the vessel at Seattle, but
whether he ever descended the (ang
plank at San Francsico cannot be dis
covered. His anxiety to get home after
his long absence bars the theory of sui
cide. His parents are almost sure now
after their long and fruitless search
that he is either the victim of a fatal
accident or has met with foul play.

NEWS OF THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA
OLNEY'S ULTIMATUM
FORCES TAYLOR OUT
DECLINES NOMINATION FOR
CITY TREASURER.
CAUSED BY BAXKING PUBLIC FUNDS
OAKLAND, Feb. 6â As a result of
an ultimatum, said to have been given
Treasurer Felton Taylor to-day by-
Mayor Olney, the former to-night for
mally announced that he had with
drawn his candidacy for re-election on
the Republican ticket. Taylor's eud
den action is supposed to be the out
come of a conference between the two
to-day, when, it Is understood, that
Mayor Olney informed Taylor that un
less he withdrew from the ticket he
would prefer charges against him of
having deposited the city's funds in
private banks instead of keeping them
in the city's vaults.
Laet week Mayor Olney publicly took
Taylor to task for what he termed a
flagrant violation of the charter in re
gard to the handling of the city's funds
and at to-days meeting between the
two it is said that the Mayor informed
Taylor that he was prepared to fully
press his charge.
When the City Council met to-night
argep were presented to that body.
The following statement issued by
Treasurer Taylor after midnight set
tler the question of what went on at
these conferences for it contains his
resignation from the Republican ticket;
"In view of the fact that the Mayor
insists that the special deposit of funds
ln the banks is a technical violation of
the charter I feel that it Is my duty
fÂ»6 a Republican to decline the nomrna
tion for Treasurer tendered me by the
Republican convention, inasmuch as
my candidacy may be a detriment to
the ticket owing to the p"isiti<'n taken
>-- Mayor. Under these conditions
uld be a difficult political fight and
I feel it would be unfair to jeopardire
the other nominees on the ticket.
TWO CONVENTIONS
NAME CANDIDATES
Democrats Indorse Most of the
Republican Nominees.
OAKLAND, Feb. 6. â Two more
municipal conventions completed

The Democratic convention was al
most pathetic in its fewness of dele

"FELTON TAYLOR."
Taylor has Insisted throughout that
the city has been protected fully, and
he had only followed a long-established
custom in depositing surplus moneys in
private banks. The present situation
results from an investigation made by
Mayor Olney last Friday morning, when
he went to Treasurer Taylor and de
manded to be allowed to count the
city's funds. Instead of finding in gold
coin all that the balances required,
certificates of deposit for $130,000 were
exhibited. It was disclosed that this
money was on deposit in the Central
Bank and the First National Bank.
Mayor Olney insisted that TayloT had
violated the city charter which, for
bids the Treasurer to deposit city funds
in banks. The Treasurer replied that
his vaults were not adequate to hold
the coin and he had, tojprotect himself,
put the money in special deposit, sub
ject to his immediate call. But this did
not satisfy the Mayor, who persisted in
his stand that this alleged violation of
the law was not to be overlooked and
that Taylor must not aspire to further
political honors. This thunderclap came
an the eve of the Republican conven
tion, but Taylor was renominated with
out opposition. That has been followed
to-day by the pronounced and insistent
demand that he withdraw and he has
heeded the demand.

BURNING CAR
ON WILD DASH
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 6. â A crowd
ed electric car on fire and running
wild, with men fighting to get to doors
or windows, and women and children
screaming frantically, caused great ex
ritement in Pasadena to-night. The
car had just been packed with people
from an entertainment, when a con
troller box in front blew out. The
motorman lost his presence of mind
v hen the flames shot up all about him
;.iid jumped off, leaving the heavy car
to dash on without control.
Hen screamed and climbed over each
other and through the windows, land
ing in heaps. In the panic the strong
trampled the weak, and it seems
miraculous that none were seriously
injured.
/ When the car was fairly tearing
along the flames and electric sparks
gave a weird exhibition with the pale
faces they lit up. Conductor Starks
made his way to the controller and air
brake at the risk of his life and stopped
the burning runaway.
FIDDLER OF PIOXEER DAYS
GOES TO THE ALMSHOUSE
A violin that made merry many a
mining camp in '49 and the early '50s
and its venerable owner, Phil Sheri
dan, were consigned to the Almshouse
yesterday. The old musician grew
tired of battling with the world and
walked into the Central Emergency
Hospital with his beloved Instrument
tucked under his arm.
â¦ k "We've &o V O t,?Â° to the Poorhouse
the fiddle and I," he said. "But I'll
give yez one more tune before we go "
he added in the cheery manner of the
Celt, who is, never completely beaten
by the buffets of fate.
Tucking the fiddle under his chin
he drew the bow across the string
and a merry tung rang through the
wards where the suffering lay
Patients badly injured and suffering
pain smiled when the merry strains
f<*ll upon their ears. The old fellow
gladly responded to encores. When
h<- had played nearly all the tunes
that delighted the men of '4 9 he laid
down his instrument reverently in its
case.
"Who'd think it"" he mused
"Old Phil Sheridan going to the
Poorhouse, Old Phil Sheridan that the
people used to throw nuggets to But
the good, old days are gone and all
the people that Old Phil knew are
gone. He's only got his fiddle left "
And the old musician patted his in
strument lovingly and said good-by
Sheridan is over 75 years of ajre

will be spread in the banquet hall. It
is expected that the senior United
Slates Senator of California, George C.
Perkins, will journey from Washing
ton to New York in order to again
listen to eloquent words from his
old friend and fellow campaigner,
George A. Knight.
The impression is misleading that
the Senator failed to respond to the
personal message which Mr. Knight
sent to him from Sacramento over
the wire a day of two before the first
Senatorial ballot. Senator Perkins did
respond, but owing to some delay in
the preparation, transmission or de
livery of the return message the re
sponse did not reach Mr. Knight until
Mr. Flint had been chosen United
States Senator. In the responsive mes
sage Senator Perkins gave expression
of sentiments of the highest regard
for Mr. Knight.
FOLDING BED IS A MUTE
WITNESS IN GRAHAM'S COURT
A folding bed, intended to illustrate
the d'jath-dealing capabilities of its
kind, was rolled into Judge Graham's
courtroom yesterday afternoon minus
the mattress and other soft things that
go to make a downy couch and hide the
mysteries of a dangerous mechanism.
This silent witness in the damage
suit of Kate Read against M. Friedman
& Co., furniture dealers, was placed
close tc tne jury box and the twelve
men who are to determine the cause,
with some humor and some wonder
ment, were treated to an exposition of
the workings of the bed by the plaintiff,
Kate Read, and her attorneys, Baggett
& Jones.
Miss Read, who is a colored woman,
Bays the bed ran amuck and did her
grievous bodily harm ln August, 1901.
She is suing the firm for $10,000 on
the strength of the mishap. The case
will be resumed to-day.
INCINERATING
COMPANY WINS
United States Court Issues
an Injunction Against the
Scavengers of. Oakland
STOPS THEIR BUSINESS
Order Will Be
Put in Force by the Dep
uty Marshals Immediately
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1018 Broadway. Feb. 6.
Judge W. W. Morrow of the United
States Circuit Court to-day issued an
injunction restraining the scavengers
of Oakland from carrying on their
business in this city pending the hear
ing of the Pacific Incinerating Com
pany's application for a permanent in
junction, under the terms of the com
pany's contract with the city of Oak
land. United States deputy marshals
will commence at once to enforce the
order. The decision gives the crema
tory people a clear field to handle all
of the city's refuse while the main
issue is unheard. The company's rep
resentatives assert they have no doubt
that the contract will be upheld.
The court's order forbids the scav
engers to collect garbage or refuse or
to obstruct or interfere with the Pa
cific Incinerating Company in the col
lection and destruction of garbage.
The order covers all points upon which
the corporation went before the Fed
eral court.
This move is the result of a long con
test between the company and the
scavengers who had refused to meet
the terms ' offered by the crematory
people when they began operations.
The scavengers continued in business
and did not surrender a customer
without a struggle. Many arrests were
made by the police, but the courts were
so clogged with cases that no progress
was made. After months of seesaw
ing in the State courts the crematory
company transferred its contest to the
Federal courts.
CLASH AGAIN
OVER CLAIMS
San Leandro Oyster Men
Wish to Gain by Law What
They Lost by Force of Arms
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Feb. 6.
Having ended the internal troubles
of the Pacific Oyster Company and the
Darbee & Immel Company by forc
ing the dissatisfied members of the
corporations to sell their stock, the
latter corporation --day filed a suit
against its enemy, the Smith Oyster
Company, which it alleges has jumped
its claim of 7000 acres of overflowed
land suitable to the propagation of
the succulent bivalve.
This claim jumping was'done with
the aid of an armed Unfted States
vessel, which was ordered to the scene
of the strife near San Leandro in
1903 to keep the peace. Troubles of
its own has kept the Immel Com
pany from taking any steps toward
the recovery of its rights. In its com
plaint filed to-day it is asserted that
the Smith Company tÂ«ok possession of
the land, cut down th* stakes marking
the Immel Company's rights, floated
off the fences and put up its own.
Since the control of the Pacific
Oyster Company was obtained by the
Darbee & Immel faction as against
that of C. P. Overton, J. R. Daggett
and R. H. Countryman, a large num
ber of suits involving the affairs of
the company on both sides of the bay
have been dismissed.

JURORS FAIL
TO FIX BLAME
Coroner's Inquest Upon the
Case of Clarence Lubben
Results in Mild Verdict
CALLS FOR DISCIPLINE
Ascribes 1 Death to Tubercu
lar Meningitis, Possibly
Hastened by Kough Play
ALAMEDA, Feb. 6.â At the inquÂ«Â«t
held this evening by Coroner Mehr
mann in the case of nine-year-old Clar
ence Lubben, who died Friday night
and whose death was ascribed in a
measure to hazing by boy pupils at
the Longfellow Grammar School, the
Jury rendered the verdict "that death
was caused by tubercular meningitis,
which possibly was hastened by rough
treatment which the deceased received
in the school yard of the Longfellow
School, and we recommend that the
authorities properly charged with that
duty see to it that a more effective
supervision be exercised over the boys
during their play hours at the said
school." On the Jury were R. M. Grant,
G. W. Johnston, H. G. Mehrtens, H.
Traube, E. J. Reese, A. It. Vivier, G.
H. Turner, L. R. Roos and C. H. Walsh.
President Frank Otis of the Board of
Education. Fred T. Moore, Superin
tendent of Schools, and Principal Carl
J. Philippi were present at the investi
gation as representatives of the school
department. President Charles R.
Smith of the West End Improvement
Association, which has Interested itself
in the alleged hazing, was present with
John Lubben, father of Clarence Lub
ben, and listened to the evidence. Mr.
Otis occasionally cross-examined wit
nesses after Coroner Mehrmann had
completed his direct questioning.
All the witnesses, including Principal
Fhillppi and Janitor Burton, asserted
that they had seen boys tossed in the
air and "bounced" by other boys. All
the witnesses, with the exception of
Philippi and Burton, thought that the
alleged hazing of the Lubben lad oc
curred on Tuesday, January 10. Phil
ippi and Burton were of the opinion
that it was on January 17. Melville
Brown, Charles H. Woest and Harold
Deal, pupils at the Longfellow School,
testified that they saw Clarence Lub
ben tossed by other boys larger than
himself, that he was permitted to Call
upon his back and that he later vom
ited.
John Lubben related how his son
came home from school on the after
noon, of Tuesday, January 10, bleeding
aÂ« the mouth and vomiting, which the
child said was caused by his being
bumped by a larger lad. Dr. C. George
Bull, who attended the Lubben boy
and who performed the autopsy, testi
fied that death was due to tubercular
meningitis, and in answer to a question
from a Juryman said that the fatal
affliction might have been brought on
or hastened by rough handling. Others
who gave testimony were Mrs. Louise
Marx, Ethel Lubben, Charles Kiser,
Lumen Chandler and Albert Hasty.

ALAMEDA ARGIS LOSES
CITY PRINTING CONTRACT
Award by Trustees Is a Surprise and
May Be Fought in the
Courts.
ALAMEDA. Feb. 6.â The award for
city printing by the trustees this even
ing was a surprise, the contract being
awarded to the West End News and
taken away from the Argus. The
Fruitvale Progress put in a bid, but
the trustees decided that the contract
would not be awarded to any paper
having a plant outside of Alameda.
Editor Lydecker of the Progress says
he will fight this rule and there may
be a claim set up that the T,"est End

City Clerk Gllogly was instructed to

DICK DEADEYE
AND HIS MATES
Oakland Society Awaiting
Revival of Ever Popular
"Pinafore" This Evening
PROCEEDS FOR CHARITY
Admirable Production of the
Famous Gilbert and Sulli-
Tan Masterpiece Promised
OAKLAND. Feb. 6.â lf ""Pinafore" is
an artistic success to-morrow night
it will be mainly due to the efforts of
Miss Pearl King, the talented society
girl, who has been drilling the amateur
opera company that will sing for char
ity at Ye Liberty. There was a dress
rehearsal at the theater this afternoon,
when everything went with a dash and
a swing that augured well for the
final performance. The choruses arÂ«
unusually good and act and sing with
a uniformity that is not only pleasing
but surprising. It is no light task to
take fifty or more people, unaccus
tomed to the stage, and train them for
any sort of a performance, not to men
tion opera, and it speaks well for the
talent of the men and women who
have given of that talent and their
time to a good cause that they are able
to do so well.
It promises to be a representative
audience that will fill the big theater I
to-morrow evening â the house is al
most sold out â and the fashionable ele
ment will be largely in evidence. The
boxes and loges have all been sold,
among those who will entertain box
parties being the Requas and th* H. A.
Butters.
As has already been announced,
"Pinafore" Is being given for the bene
fit of the Congregational Chapel In
Fruitvale and everybody in that sub
urb of beautiful homes is Interested in
its success. Mrs. Henry Wetherbee of
Fruitvale, who has ever been a leading
spirit in the work of building and
maintaining the chapel, is the origina
tor and general manager of the "Pina
fore" production, and many of her
friends are coming from San Fran
cisco to hear the opera sung.
One of the prettiest features of the
evening will be the dancing of the
sailor's hornpipe by Miss Davlda
Bleuel, with pantomime accompani
ment by the whole company. Little
Marie Bennett makes a very cunning
midshlpmite.
The principals, Mrs. Mary Carpenefo
Mead, Miss Gertrude Gould. Miss Ruth
Weston, Dr. Rodolph, Harry Perry,
Louis Jacoby, Clarence Oliver and
Sanford Bennett, are all stars and sev
eral of the numbers will undoubtedly
receive more than one encore.
The regular company of the theater
will give a short curtain raiser,
"Mixed Pickles," before the opera be
gins.
FORGET CHILD
DURING A FIRE
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN BERNARDINO, Feb. Â«.âWil
liam Addison, a four-year-old boy, was
burned to death in the flames which
destroyed the home of his parents, Mr.
and Mrs. John Addison. to-night. The
fire spread with great rapidity from a
defective flue and while the occupants
of the house tried to fight it, they for
got the child in a rear room. The
flames were soon beyond their control
and then it was found that access to
the baby was cut off by a wall of
flame.
The district is not yet provided with
water mains and the firemen's hose
proved unavailing owing to the lack of
water. The house and its contents
were burned to the ground, adjoining
residences being saved only by the
hardest work.
JURIST IS ACCUSED.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 6.â The charges
against Superior Judge Lucas F. Smith
of Santa Cruz and the petition for his
impeachment, that have been expected
for some time, were presented in the
Assembly to-day by Cleveland of Santa
Cruz. The charges are as published in
The Call at the opening of the session.
They are fathered by John H-. Leonard,
a Santa Cruz attorney, and are accom
panied by affidavits from Harrison
Rich, William Ayedelotte, M. T. Lang
ley, Julius H. Haesters, William Gard
ner and William F. White.
Favoritism to Attorney Charles M.
Cassin is the first accusation put for
ward. The Judge is accused of telling
Peter Paul Hartman, a litigant, that if
he had employed Cassin instead of
"that drunken lawyer," George P.
Burke, he would have fared better. It
is also charged that Judge Smith al
lowed Cassin to batter Thomas Dakan.
a litigant, in his presence and then
fined . Dakan for defending himself;
that when Nathan Smith waa convict
ed of assault with a deadly weapon
Judge Smith told his attorney that if
he would get a petition signed by 100
Watsonvllle people asking for leniency
he wquld sentence Smith lightly, and
that upon presentation of su* h petition
the defendant was sentenced to six
months in the County Jail: that Judge
Smith arbitrarily struck from the file
the complaint in the case of Helen
Younger against Charles Moore and
others because the Judge was a party
defendant; that when Nicholas Sam
buck was suing the Southern Pacific
Railroad Company for damages for al
leged injuries Judge Smith told his at
torney to let the railroad physicians
examine him, and told him to "bend
and squeal" while such examination
was in progress; that when Louis
Buelna was convicted of a statutory
crime Judge Smith told his mother to
induce him to waive all motion for a
new trial and that the court would give
him a light sentence, and that upon
this being done Judge Smith sentenced
Buelna to serve ninety years; that the
accused Imprisoned Attorneys P. E. Za
bala and J. J. Wyatt on fictitious and
false contempt charges; that 50 per cent
of all civil and 75 per cent of all crim
inal cases decided by him are reversed
by the Supreme Court, and, finally, that
he has at times shown great contempt
for the supreme tribunal of the State.
The charges and petition were or
dered printed in the journal and were
made a special order for to-morrow.

Dispatches from Ottawa in this con

er American companies engaged in
halibut fishing are encroaching in
waters under the jurisdiction of the
Canadian Government on the Pacific

is probable they will recommend that
the Board of University Regents h*
held responsible for the defalcat:
former Secretary W. A. McKowen. who
is now serving a sentence at San Quen

Regents he compelled to refund th*
$53,000 stolen by McKowen.
Speaking of the findings of the com
mittee. Senator Carter, chairman, said:
"A majority of the members of thy
committee believe that the
Regents should be held responsible for
the McKowen defalcation. The com
mittee will prepare its report as soon as
possible, although it has until February
10 to complete its task."
Senator Lukens. another member of
the committee, said.
"It is my opinion that the* Rearent*
cannot escape the responsibility for th*Â»
loose financial system that made it pos
sible for McKowen to steal the large
sum that he did. It seems to me th^y
will hav<> to make up the loss."
The report probably will contain the
further recommendation that a suit f-r

against the Regents by the Attorney
General.

the object of the Democratic caucus
had br-en accomplished. That object,
he said, was to let the President of the
United States and the minority mem
bers of the majority party know that
there would be no mere partisan and
fartinnal opposition to a great public
measure. The rule, he said, amid
Democratic applause, had been brought
to for the purpose of preventing a ma
jority of the entire House, composed of
thf Democrats solidly and a number of
Republicans, from formulating a bill
which would accomplish the purpose
SOL'.ght.
'"Your object is." he said, "to prevent
your own men from amending your
| own bill with our assistance."
The Townsend-Ksch bill, he said, had
been framed on the presumption that
the Interstate Commerce Commission
would commit an error, which was to
be guarded against. William? then of
1 fefed to surrender every moment of
I debate if the rule were so amended as
, tv permit the vote to be taken on these
I amendments. He even offered to give
â  up the vo-te on the minority substitute
! if the privilege he asked was accorded.
ADOPTED BY REPUBLICANS.
Dalzell, however, denounced the prop
osition. The three amendments Wil
liams demanded were, he said, to give
the Interstate Commission power to
substitute a rate for one declared un
fair; to make that rate operative until
laid aside by final judgment of a court,
and to base an appeal or review to a
court upon evidence' adduced before
the Interstate Commerce Commission.
The- debate was brought to a close by
Dalzell, who said, amid Republican
laughter, that a Democratic caucus
v.as an exceedingly unnecessary thing
when it sought to give aid to the Presi
dent and the Republican party.
He congratulated the Democratic
party that since November last "they
have discovered that the man in Â£he
White House is a good man not only
for Republicans but also for Demo
crats to follow."
He argued that nothing could be
fairer than to permit the House to
pass on the ..wo propositions â the bill
of the majority and the minority sub
stitute. Dalzell would not agree to a
suggestion by Cockran of New York
th;!t the time for debate be dimin- 1
ish'-d. the remaining time to be de
voted to considering amendments.
This caused Cockran to remark that
the Democratic party proposed to sur
render debate and substitute action
In its stead.
On a rollcall the rule was adopted.
166 to 140. The House then went into
a committee of the whole to consider
the Towneend-Esch bill, with Currier
of Xew Hampshire in the chair
TOWNSEND OPENS DEBATE.
Townsend of Michigan, one of the
authors of the measure, began the
debate. He said that the bill present
ed ample occasion to bring into promi
nence the agitator who desired no
toriety before his constituents and
who was eager to strike a blow at the
railroads, "above or below the belt."
The occasion, he said, was equally
fruitful "for that greed and selfishness
born of great power and nurtured by
a desire for financial gain, which
would deceive the Congress and
the nation Into believing that the
creatures of the Government are out
side and beyond its control and that
the Droblem is so great and complex
that only the railroads can solve it."
Townsend, in reply to Richardson
of Alabama, said positively that the
bill. In conection with the so-called
Elkins act, would reach the private
car lines.
Richardson of Alabama said the de
mar- d for legislation to regulate
freight rate 6 had come in such an
earnest way that Congress could not
for a moment disregard it, but he
counseled against engaging in hasty
or hostile legislation. He w-as par
ticularly antagonistic to a special
court to pass on rates, maintaining
that it was a departure from the ju
dicial Bystem of the Government
PRIVATE LINES DISCUSSED.
Case Argued For and Against Before
House Committee.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 6. â Opposi
tion to Federal control of private car
lines was presented to-day before the
sub-committee of the House Commit
tee on Interstate and Foreign Com
merce by President Reichman of
Street's Western Stable Car Lines. He
detailed the operations of his com
pany to support the contention that
it was not engaged in interstate com
merce.
E. M. Ferguson of Duluth, Minn.,
representing a number of jobbing as
sociations, was before the committee.
Ferguson said that in order to get
around the requirement to publish
rates, the Santa Fe operates about
5000 cars under a separate system or
corporation distinct from the railroad
< orporation. During the hearings
Ferguson referred repeatedly to the
Pere Marquette Railroad, and Sena
tor Newlands asked why reference to
that road was so frequent.
'Because we have been able to get
hold of a contract between that line
and the Armour Car Company and it
is of that contract I am speaking,"
said Ferguson. He concluded with a
demand for the extermination of the
private car line companies. He said
he believed the majority of railroads
will favor such elimination.

NEW YORK, Feb. 6. â President Un

Illinois Representative Attempts to
Add to the Details of Alleged
Boodling.
SPRINGFIELD, 111., Feb. 6.âRep
resentative Frank D. Comerford, au
thor of the charges of corruption that
precipitated the legislative investiga
tion now in progress, gave his fellow
lawmakers to-day a still greater
shock. He attempted to read what he
called a bill of particulars, reinforcing
his attack and giving charges in de

read. After a half-hour's deliberation
the committee announced that a full
investigation would be made of every
thing touched upon in the bill. A
heated wrangle ensued. Co*nerford in
timated that there was bad faith and
an attempt to whitewash.

had been made to bribe him in con

NOBLES APPEAL TO NICHOLAS
ON BEHALF OF PEOPLE.
Ask That Representation .
Be Granted the Masses
ST. PETERSBURG. Feb. 6.â The As
sembly of Nobles of St. Petersburg to
day adopted an address to Emperor
Nicholas, congratulating him on the
birth of the heir to the throne and as
suring him of the confidence of the na
tion. The address asserts that the
union between the autocratic monarch
and his devoted nation is unshaken by
recent events at home and abroad, begs
his Majesty to permit of representa
tives of the whole people participating
in the discussion and legislation on
Government measures, and says:
Sire: "We have met in troublous times.
Foes are attacking us. their aim. being to bring
Russia to a shameful peace and bring to
naught the system of government which has
been sanctioned by centuries. A way out of
the difficulties must be found. We realize
that every word addressed by your Majesty
in this painful hour is weighted with grave
responsibility. We are all witnesses to your
Majesty's efforts to secure the welfare of Rus
sia. The decree of December '2't revived the
hopes of your subjects, who saw therein the
true salvation of the fatherland.
This is not the first time dark clouds have
lowered over Russia; but, despite former
efforts to shake the basis of the Government,
the country becanif stronger and advanced
proudly and puis^antly along the path of
progress. From union between an autocratic
monarch and a devoted nation Russia has
ever derived a strength which neither the
foreign foe nor trouble at home could exhaust.
Sire, the nobility of St. Petersburg are con
vinced that this union is unshaken and must
prevail. With tliÂ° aid of God our valiant
troocs. who are not sparing their lives for th--
Emperor and the fatherland, will crown the
Russian arms with fresh glory and troubles at
home will cease.
Sire, the whole nation awaits with eagerness
the fuinilment of ' the Imperial will; but offi
cials and statesmen, of whatever qualities and
zeal, cannot solve all the questions of the na
tion's life. Your forefathers harkened to thÂ«>
voice of Russians elected by the nation, and
this custom, so far from weakening, strength
ened the autocracy and aided it to attain its
present greatness.
Sire, order now that elected representatives
of the country may raise their voices to the
throne and participate, in accordance with your
sovereign direction, in legistlation and the dis
cussion of governmental measures. The nobles
of St. Petersburg sincerely believe that, pro
vided union of the throne and nation Â»s sup
ported with confidence on the part of the Em
peror, internal troubles will vanish and that all
Russia will rise and serve the sovereign faith
fully for the salvation and glory of the country
and the confusion of Us enemies.
The address was adoptedâ lsÃ to 20.
The workmen here have decided to
petition the Emperor to receive a depu
tation chosen by themselves, on the
ground that the deputation recently
received by him at Tsarskoe Selo was
chosen by the masters and was in no
sense representative of the workmen.

ROOTED REBELS
SUE FOR PEACE
BUENOS AYRES, Feb. 6.âGovern
ment troops attacked the rebels, who
had fortified themselves at Mendoza, at
dawn to-day. Soon afterward the rebel
leaders fled to the mountains and the
men surrendered unconditionally. The
rebels had sacked the local branch of
the National Bank of Buenos Ayres
and seized $300,000. Numerous arrests
have been made and the city is now
quiet.
Late information shows that the in
surrectionary movement is now re
stricted to Cordoba. Generals Wintter,
Bravides, Garcia and Roca, with
largely superior forces, are surround
ing the city. The rebels are holding
Senator Yofre.
The Buenos Ayres police have seized
a quantity of guns and revolvers; also
many copies of manifestos and revolu
tionary documents.
The onl.- group of rebels in the
province of Buenos Ayres, 170 men
strong, has been defeated near Piro
va#io station. Two officers and seven
men were killed and 121 surrendered.
The rest, with Commandant Villama
hor, are retreating and Government
troops are in pursuit.
The insurrection is admitted to have
been a failure, and the Government
now has matters well in hand. Yes
terday the military rebels at Cordoba
endeavored to make terms with the
Government by offering to surrender if
they were absolved, and permitted to
retain their rank, threatening that if
these conditions were refused they
would hold as hostages Dr. Alcorta.
the Vice President of the republic, and
other notable personages surprised and
captured In that city on Saturday.
President Qulntana declined to listen
to any compromise, adding that rebels
had no rights as combatants and would
be amenable to military law.
The prompt suppression of the out
break would indicate the absence of all
the usual elements of a revolution. The
rising was purely military and was
limited In Its proportions.
"WASHINGTON, Feb. 6.â Beaupre.
the American Minister at Buenos
Ayres, in a cablegram received at the
State Department to-day, gays that
tranquillity has been restored there;
that the Government will be able to
suppress the uprising without serious
military operations, and that martial
law has been proclaimed in the repub
lic for thirty days. The Minister adds
that public opinion generally condemns
the revolutionary movement and that
business is progressing In the city as
usual.

TAKES SECRET
TO THE GRAVE
Special Dispatch to The Call-
TACOMA, Feb. 6.â With the death of
John Smith, a well-known character of
Tacoma, on Saturday night, the secret
location of a placer gold mine said to
be fabulously rich has been lost.
Smith was an old man, with few
friends and no family. Once each year
he has made a solitary pilgrimage into
the Cascade Mountains. Just where or
how he went no one knows, but after
an absence of only a few weeks each
summer he would return with from one
to two thousand dollars 'worth of gold
dust. Friends tried unsuccessfully to
learn the secret of his riches from the
old man and several have tried to fol
low him into the rocky fastnesses of
the foothills.
Soon after his return from the moun
tains last summer Smith was taken
sick and for a long time occupied a
room in a hospital. Saturday night he
was taken with a hemorrhage of the
lungs, and realizing that he was about
to die he started to tell a friend who
was with him the location of his mine.
Before he could give full directions
how to reach the place he died, and his
secrsi; will be buried with his body.

Uncle Sam's Naval Men
LONDON, Feb. 6. â No British
cruiser squadron will leave England at
the end of February on a cruise
around the world under the com

cruise of several months with the ob
ject of showing the British flag in dis

American ports.
The exact date and details of thÂ»
squadron's cruise in American waters

IS the Legislature doing anything to carry out the well digested
recommendations of the Governor for comprehensive tax reform?
Some piecemeal bills have been introduced, but the matter can
not be <lÂ«.ii: with in that way. If any part of the present system is
to be changed the whole should be changed <in<j replaced by a sane
and simple plan, which will forever separate the objects of taxation
for purposes of Siato- revenue from those that yield local revenue.
This is distinctly a borne rule. proposition. Under the existing sys
tem our local governments fix valuations for the purposes of taxation
and arrange the rate. Then the State Board of Equalization takes
it out of the tnds of the local authorities and proceeds to equalize
San ffanascb *ith San Bernardino, Alameda with Sacramento, and
to raise or lower the local assessment as the needs of the State
revenue seem to require. In this way home rule is entirely over
thrown, and we have the annual pilgrimage of local assessors and
committees of Hoards of Supervisors to Sacramento to implore the
State Hoard of Equalization for mercy to localities.
It is said that railroad corporations object to the system of
unitary taxation for State purposes only. We arc not able to regard
Mich objection as valid. Surely it is more convenient to have one
assessment of theil property than fifty assessments, and then have a
majority of these fifty assessments changed and disturbed by inter
vention of the State Hoard of Equalization. One assessment and one
tax, paid at one place, seems more business-like than the present
plan. If the Legislature will so provide, the tax on corporations for
State purposes only may be supplemented by a tax on State licenses
of many kinds, introducing for the purposes of State taxation a num
ber of varieties of privileges and property that now pay no tax at all.
It seems to be agreed on all hands that the present method of
taxation is unequal and defective, unscientific and expensive. The
State Grange hat disclosed its defects, and no one has appeared to
defend 'them. Personal property should be taxed where it is found,
regardless of the residence of the owner. It is a fiction of the
kest character that the owner of personal property may have his
property in one jurisdiction, while it is taxed in another, because
that is his legal residence. Personal property is I mobile and in
come producing property, and its owner puts it where its capacity
is the greatest. If be can do this and then take up his legal resi
dence where taxation is the lightest and so escape taxation of his
property where it is earning profits, violence is done to all proper
principles for the equalization of the burdens and benefits of gov
ernment.
It is â  great question and one of such absorbing interest to the
people that they will expect the present Legislature to propose some
plan for a complete change. The shortness of the session and the
devotion of much time to exciting personal issues may prevent any
action. But so it will be with all future sessions. The same reasons
that prevent action BOW will always be present. The session is only
sixty days. Time goes into settling questions of patronage. The
appropriations are for a great variety of objects, all of which must
be examined. It is no reflection on members to say that many of
them are better qualified to deal with the routine of legislation than
they are to frame â  comprehensive and equitable scheme of taxation.
The few who can grasp a subject so entirely scientific, naturally
have much of their time taken up with other matters of legislation
that |Â«ire the order of talent which they possess.
Under such circumstances it is probable that but little will be
done at this or any future session, through the legislative initiative.
But the subject is of such pressing importance that it should not be
neglected. Even*' year increases the evil wrought by the crudities
and the cost of our present method of assessment and taxation. The
inequalities are becoming more glaring, and especially is the burden
being shifted more and more to country realty. Something must be
done; but how, and on what initiative? The Governor has done his
duty in the premises. The statement of the case in liis message
cannot he improved. It puts the e\ ll and discusses plainly the rem
edy. But there the Governor's power over the issue ceases. He
may urge the Legislature to do something, but he cannot compel it
to do anything. All of these difficulties have been encounterci in i
other States, and have been met by the appointment of a State com- ,
mission on taxation, charged to investigate the whole subject and re
port a bill for action by the Legislature, with arguments supporting
its recommendations. It the present session can do nothing else it
can give the Governor power to appoint such a commission. It need
not consist of more than three members. Naturally Professor Plehn
of the university would be a member, for he is one of the leading
authorities on taxation in the United States and has a high standing
with foreign publicists. A commission of which he is,a member can
not fsll to report a system of taxation that will rationalize the whole
matter and give us a â¢nple and economical scheme in place of the
crudities and inequalities from which the State suffers. Will the
Legislature understand that the matter is too important to be wholly
neglected and that a commission is probably the shortest and best
way to the needed reform ?
HAZING IN THE SCHOOLS.
WITHIN the last year nearly twenty school children in the in
termediate or prammar grades have been killed* or seriously
injured by their companions in the cruel process of hazing.
The wild and reckless pranks of young nen at college seem to have
set an evil example, that is followed in the public schools. Usually
the 1 aker and shyer the victim the more severe is his punishment.
The children who are led by a mad spirit of cruelty to inflict these
injuries have no judgment to guide them and do not know how
serious may be the consequences of what they call sport. In Ala
meda within a month one boy has been seriously injured and an
other probably killed by this barbarous practice. It is a mistake to
let school children fall into these habits, on the ground that rough
play develops manliness. There is nothing manly in cruelty, nor
in ading the personal rights of others. Instead of making manly
boys it makes bullies and cowards, who will do in a crowd what none
would dare do alone. Parents send their children to school to ac
quire knowledge and not to be tossed up and injured or killed.
The evil seems to be growing and the casualties are so numercms
as to justify school boards in issuing instructions to teachers to
admonish pupils that such cruelties must cease. The public has an
interest in the matter, too, and a part to perform. There is too much
toleration of the rudeness and lawlessness of the young men at col
lege, whose exar is responsible for the deaths and injuries in
the public schools. Because young men are at college they do not
gain immunity to destroy or deface property, nor to be rude and
rough ir. public places. The effervescent spirits of youth can find
play consistent with respect for the rights of others. Let it be un
derstood that young men do not go to college to defy the law and
lampoon their professors, but to be gentlemen seeking a learned
equipment for a career.

FRANK H. SWEET
AS they walked she told her com
panion of new plans. That very
day she had secured employment
in the blanket factory, and would
commence work the next morning.
Six months before she had come home
â  broken wreckâ her husband recently
killed in a drunken brawl, her own life
â polled, as she thought, by the man
against whom she . had been warned.
But now, with renewed health and
resolution,' she was about to commence
life again, to build up from the wreck.
Halstead listened quietly until she fin
ished, then. broke out: '
' "You know there ain't no need for It,
Kitty. You know I've been' waitin' for
you to get BtrOBC so I could say the
same thing I did beforeâ before you
met him. it didn't seem right to per
suade jcui when you first came;Â»you
were bo weak an' tired. But now you're
strong Main an' know your own mind.
An. Kitty"â his voice trembling *in
spite of his effortÃ at self-controlâ "l've
been waitin' a good many years. I've
neVer felt to marry anybody else."
Her hand rose impetuously to stop
him.
"But you must think to marry some
body else, Halstead," she said earnest
ly. "You're too good a man to be wast
ed that way. An' you must Btop think-
In' of me, for It can't over be, afterâ
niter what's gone by. I ain't much,
but I couldn't be so mean as to harm
a man like that. Now, Halstead,
please" â touching his arm as she saw
the grim amusement on his face â
"don't make me go on feelln* I've
ruined your life. There's Nelly Bocup.
She likes you, an' â "
Halstead laughed aloud.
"No use talkin* that way, Kitty," he
interrupted. "I want you, an' If I can't
have you now I'm willln' to wait a
while. When it gets too hard 1 shall
grab you up an' run so fast an' far you
won't be able to get breath to say no."
"I'm sorry, Halstead." There were
tears in Kitty's eyes, but her voice was
firm. "I shan't ever marry any man
to hamper him. It won't be no use for
you to wait and ask me again, ever."
There was much ploknrsH in the town
that fall- a malignant spotted fever,
highly contagious and one by one the
poorer portion! of the town were put
under quarantine. Then one evening:
Ha;ste;i(l helped what ho thought to be
a drunken man to hla home, and the
next day the man CRine down with the
f. vi r and within a week was dead.
Within an hour after Halstead heard
this ho was on his way to the woods
for what he said was to be a few days"
hunting. In reality, It was to watch
himself.
One morning before people had be
gun to appear on the ptreeta he staÂ«c
pered to the sidewalk outside the fence
of his sister's home, where Kitty
boarded.
"Mary, oh, Mnry." he called. Th*n
when his sister appeared at the door,
"Don't come any nearer. Tou know
that empty caMn op by the big rock,
Where we walk sometimes?"
Yes."
' "Well. I want you to send some food
and water there soon's you can. I've
got the fever. Wait." raising his TotOt
a little bitterly as she withdrew hur
riedly Into the house. "There ain't a
mite of danger this far. not for you
nor the children. I won't go near the
cabin till you get Â£he things In. so It'll
be safe. I'll stay off In the woods a
couple of hour?. Put please hurry, for
I'm beplnnin' to lose sense of thincrs."
"Halstead!" It was a quiet but per
emptory voice from an upper window.
Hatetead raised his eyes and tried to
nx his mind on what he saw there.
"Kilty. Kitty." he said dreamily,
"that you" Hetter go In an" shut the
window. Maybe the wind's blowin'
that way."
â¢Halstead." the voice said slowly
nnd distinctly, "can you go straight to
the cabin by yourself?"
"Course," Indignantly, "straight's

"No," peremptorily, "you must ga

maybe it wouldn't be h,est. Now go,

head undecidedly. But the voice had
been clear and incisive, and just now
it was easier for him to obey than to
think. So he nodded vaguely and
staggered up the sidewalk. Kitty
wat-hed him anxiously until she re
alized that In spite of his wavering
steps he was heading toward the
cabin. Then she hurried downstairs.
Mary met her at the foot.
"What do you mean, Kitty?" she
began wildly; "you're not going up
there to him, an' then come back to
me an' the children? Most every
body's died of the fever so far."
"That's all right. Mary." answered
Kitty soothingly. "I'm not comln'
bai k. You would't have Halstead be
without a nurse, would you?"
"But everybody dies most, an' you'll
sure take It," remonstrated Mary hys
terically.
Halstead did not die, but It was
more than three months before he
was able to leave his bed and totter
across the cabin floor to a seat In the
doorway. There he sat for a long
time gasping for breath and gazing
moodily at the distant mountain tops.
Kitty came to him there a.fter she had
arranged his bed and tidied the room.
"Doesn't it look good, Halstead?"
she said.
He did not answer at onoe, but
presently turnefi to her with a dreary
smile.
"I â I don't know rs It does, Kitty,"
he replied. "You heard the doctor
tell me it would likely be six months
before I would begin to do any work.

Just the same as If I was gettin' to
be an old man." He was silent for
some minutes, then added: "An' that
ain't all. Kitty. It'll take every cent
I've got to i'ny the doctor. You see,
before you came I never saved any
thing. I didn't feel any need. What

CZAR ONE-EARED,
BELIEVE THE
PEASANTS.
The uneducated peasants in the
Cherson province of Russia have an
extraordinary belief that the Czar has
only one ear. They are confirmed in
their belief by pictures and photo
graphs of the Czar showing a side face
, view, and naturally exhibiting only
one ear. They account for the ab
sence of the other in the following
manner:
Some time agt> a deputation from
their province waited upon the Czar
and in the course of the meeting the
Czar is said to have stated that all
Russian land would be divided equal
ly among the peasants of the various
districts.
To this one of the deputation boldly
said:
"As sure as you can not see your own
ears you will not divide the land."
The Czar's reply to this was to cut
off one of his (the Czar's) ears, which
he placed upon the table, remarking as
ho did so:
"As surely as I now see my ear I
will divide the land."
To this day the Cherson peasants
firmly believe that he has only one
ear, and unless the Cxar visits them
in person and proves to them by opti
cal demonstration that he possesses
the correct number this extraordinary
belief will not be shaken.

she would marry him.
He paid her the $200 In notes, sil

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 7, 1905.
WATKINS TELLS
OF BOARD WORK
Creditors' Settlements in
Twenty-Eight Years Show
Average of 48 Per Cent
MILLIONS ARE INVOLVED
Officers Are Re-elected by
Trade Body to Serve One
Year Without Exception
President A. A. Watkins of the \
Board of Trade of San Francisco re
ported at an annual meeting yesterday
that in the last twenty-eight years the
number of failures in business in
which the board has been called upon
to act numbered 13,472; that the lia
bilities in these failures reached the
great aggregate of $81,392,028; that
the average liabilities per firm were
$6041 57; and that the amount of re
coveries, amounting to $39,616,300,
represented an average percentage of
settlement of .4867.
This showing was used as an argu
ment for membership in the board.
Mr. Watkins said that "it is a matter
of record that the dividends received
through the medium of courts, in in
solvency cases, average less than 25
per cent. Our organization is a com
munity of interest. Every commercial
house and every manufacturer in this
city selling goods on credit should
become members of this organization,
thereby protecting their interests to
the mutual benefit of all."
Dealing with the commercial failures
in California Mr. Watkins reported
that the number in 1904 was 513 and
the liabilities in these failures reached
$1,4 98,127. In the preceding year the
failures numbered 406 and the liabil
ities were $3,840,017. The last year
therefore showed a decrease in the lia
bilities, as compared with 1903 of
$2,341,890 and an increase of 107 in
the number of failures.
Reviewing the commercial situation
in a large way Mr. Watkins found that
San Francisco now ranks eighth
among American cities in the matter
of bank clearances, and that in 1904
the San Francisco bank clearances
surpassed those of Los Angeles, Seat
; tie, Portland, Spokane and Tacoma
combined by $563,333,025.
j President Watkins, detailing the do
ings of the board during the year,
mentioned that the Board of Trade
had adopted resolutions received from
the Merchants' Association, which had
been sanctioned by the last named
body, in opposition to conferring the
power of ratemaking upon the Inter
state Commerce Commissioners.
Secretary H. L. Smith reported that
the present membership of the board
is 207. In the last year the cases re
ported numbered 1215 and action was
taken in 767 of these. In 34 cases the
loss was total
A report was received from Isaac
Upham, the treasurer, in which the
finances of the year were considered.
After the reports had been received
the annual election took place. A. A.
Watkins. C. R. Havens and William
Cluff were elected directors. The di
rectors subsequently met and elected
A. A. Watkins, president; T. J. Par
sons and Siegfried Nickelsburg, vice
presidents; H. L. Smith, secretary;
Isaac Upham, treasurer; and Joseph
Kirk, attorney. These are the old of
ficers, all re-elected.
HUSBAND WINS DIVORCE
ON HIS CROSS-COMPLAINT
Dentist Brown Troves to Court's Sat-
isf action That II Ls Wife De
serted Him.
Mary A. Brown, who sued Calvin D.
Brown, a dentist, for divorce on the
ground of his neglect, did not press
her charge and the complaint was dis
missed yesterday by Judge Hunt, who
awarded the decree to .the husband on
his cross-complaint, charging deser
tion. Judge Hunt also granted a di
vorce to Agnes ilacoraber from Frank
Maeomber for neglect, and Judge Sea
well divorced Edith W. Riffner from
Emory H. Riffner on the grourfd of
his desertion.
Catherine Daver, whose husband, P.
E. Daver, has a dry goods and notion
store at 110 Eighth street, yesterday
sued him for divorce on the ground of
cruelty and desertion. She says he
threatened to "stick a knife in her
throat." Judge Graham enjoined Da
ver from disposing of his $3000 stock.
Marie McDonald, who says her hus
band, Daniel, has more than $3000 in
bank, asks for divorce on the ground
of desertion. Suit for separation waa
begun by Frances Kirwan against
James P. Kirwan for neglect; by Mary

SCHUSSLER TELLS
COMPANY SECRETS
How Spring Valley Worked Against
Gmnsky's Proposed Supply Prom
the Tuolumne River Watershed.
Hermann Schussler in his testimony
yesterday before United States Com
missioner Heacock, in the case of the
Spring Valley Water Company against
the Mayor and the Supervisors of San
Francisco, told several interesting
tfiings when cross-examined by As
sistant City Attorney Partridge. His
story was that when Engineer Grun
sky filed a report with the Supervisors
recommending the acquisition of the
Tuolumne River as an independent
source of municipal water supply the
water company took steps to defeat
the proposition. Schussler admitted
that he went to Hetch-Hetchy Val
ley and satisfied himself by borings
that a dam was practicable and that
the system recommended by Grunsky
was feasible. The company engaged
an attorney named Dennett at Mer
ced to stir the farmers to protest
against the proposal to take water out
of the Tuolumne and Schussler went
to the Secretary of the Interior to de
fend the company, he said, against
the slanders that were being circulat
ed regarding the purity and the vol
ume of the water supplied to this city.
The examination will be resumed
this morning.
Two Deaths From SUght Falls.
William Krueger, a widower, 85

REMITS SMALL
EXCESS TAXES
Board Decides Not to Print
the Names of 21,000 Delin
quent Property Holders
TO BUY CITY CEMETERY
Accepts Offer of Site in
San 3[ateo County Subject
to Confirmation of Title
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
adopted the recommendation of the Fi
nance Committee that the names of
some 21,000 delinquent taxpayers on the
unsecured personal property roll, whose
unpaid balances amount to one cent
or less be omitted from the delinquent
tax list of the year 1904. The excess
tax became due owing to the fact that
taxes were collected under the rate for
1903, and the tax rate for 1904, adopted
subsequently, was about one cent on
every $100. Tax Collector Smith re
ported that the cost of printing the
delinquents will amount to three cents
per name and the placing of house
holders on the delinquent list would
entail a great hardship in penalties.
A resolution was adopted accepting
the offer of the Brooks estate to sell to
the city twenty-five acres of land in
San Mateo County for $8750, to
be used as n. site for a city
cemetery for San Francisco. The
site adjoins the Chinese Cemetery
and the city cemetery owned by Ed
ward Kelly, one of the contractors for
the burial of the indigent dead. The
final acceptance of the offer is subject
to the City Attorney's approval of the
title. An appropriation of $5000 was
made in this year's budget for the pur
pose, and the balance of $3750 will be
raised in the next budget.
The petitions of the Board of Works
for authority to construct a concrete
parapet on grade from the beach to
the Cliff House at a cost of $4500; the
construction of sewers and macadam
izing the roadway and sidewalks on
Buena Vista avenue and on Holly Park
avenue, at a cost- respectively, of $500*
and $4000, were referred to the Street
Committee.
Formal juithority was given to the
Board of Works to repair bituminous
pavements and to use the funds set
aside for the purpose by the adoption
of a resolution on the subject.
Another appropriation of $400 was
made to continue the sanitary work in ,
Chinatown up to March 1, when it;
will cease.

CRUELLY TREATS
WIFE AND BABE
Warrant for the Arrest of
Wade H. Shadlmrne Sworn
Out by His Father-in-Law
A pitiful case of heartless neglect
of a young wife and child by a hus
hand enamored of another woman
was disclosed yesterday when Carl
Prazak swore to a complaint before
Police Judge Fritz charging Wade H.
Shadburne, his son-in-law, w : ith fail
ure to provide for his baby girl,
Thelma, 21 months old. Shadburne
Is a son of George D. Shadburne, the
well-known attorney, and ia manager
for a phonograph typewriting com
pany.
Prazak lives at 26 Joice street.
Shadburne, after his marriage, lived
with his wife at her father's home,
where her baby was born. It is al
leged that during the three years of
their married life Shadburne has not
contributed over $200 toward .the sup^
port of his wife and child. AHe left
his father-in-law's roof on November
30 last and ten days later returned
for his clothes. At that time he gave
his wife $10. Since then verbal and
written requests have been made to
him for money, but they have been
ignored.
Mrs. Shadburne is a young and
beautiful woman, but for the last
fourteen months she has been confined
to bed with inflammatory rheumatism,
which has temporarily made her a
cripple. With the best of care it will
be over a year before she is able to
walk.
What adds to her grief is the al
leged discovery that her husband had
been paying attention to another girl.
On January 22 a letter addressed to
her husband was sent to his office
and' from there to 26 Joice street. This
was in a woman's handwriting and the
invalid wife's curiosity was aroused.
She opened the envelope and made a
copy of the letter. It is as follows:
My Dearest Hampton: I write to tell you
I cannot make any appointment for Friday
or the near future. You do not know how I
hate to write this note, but it ls the best for
both of us ,It grieves me more than you
know. Forgive me this time and think of me
as one you know not, not as happy Sue of
three years ago, a llttla girl. I beg of you
not. to be angry for your affections belong not
to me. I am not a thief, so there. I may not
have It and it is a happiness I cannot enjoy
under existing circumstances, you understand,
and I can never be the one to ask you to
change them. You are a man now. Throw
off this frivolous delusion you are sailing un
der. Captain your own heart and soul, be
honorable to those you are bound with ana
Almighty God will never fall to reward your
sacrifice. A little trial that you will soon
become accustomed to and the fruits of which
will make you a happy man on this earth.
Wishing you all the good health and success,
your friend always, from silent, true and only
yours, __^ SUZANNE.
Goxernor Will Open Bids.
Bids for the construction of the
California building 'to be erected at
the Lewis and Clark Exposition at
Portland will be opened by Governor
Pardee at Sacramento next Monday.
The plans and specifications have been
received at the office of the World's
Fair Commission in the Palace Hotel.
While the building will be nearly four
times as large as the California struc
ture at St. Louis, it is estimated that
the cost will be much less propor
lonately. The principal materials will
be wood and staff.

U. S. Attorney Woodworth
Formally Complains About
Commissioner's Queer Act
SIX WOMEN ESCAPE
Report of James R. Dunn
Presented by Accused Man
After Witnesses Depart
A dispatch from The Call's special
correspondent at Washington an
nounces that United States IMstrlct
Attorney Marshall B. Woodworth, of
this city, has filed with the Depart
ment of Justice a formal complaint
against Hart H. North, United States
Immigrant Commissioner at this port.
The complaint is to the effect that
North allowed six Chinese women, im
portant witnesses against / Lee Toy and
Da Silva, to go to China, instead of
detaining them here. Lee Toy and Da
Silva, the latter at one time Chinese
Interpreter in Mr. North's office, were
tried a few days ago in the United
States District Court on a charge of
attempting to import four Chinese wo
men into this country for immoral
purposes. The women swore positive
ly against Lee Toy and also incrim
inated Da Silva, but there being no
corroborative evidence to offset the
denial of the prisoners the jury chose
to believe them rather than the wo
men and brought In a verdict of ac
quittal. Shortly after the arrest of Da
Silva and Lee Toy, when the depart
ment at Washington was informed of
the statements of the four women,
James R, Dunn, Inspector In charge
of the Chinese Bureau at the St. Louis
Exposition, interviewed the eight wo
men who had come over with the de
fendants and the four women on the
steamship Doric and got statements
from six of them similar to those made
by the four women at San Francisco.
Mr. Dunn sent these statements to
Mr. North, who notified the United
States Attorney of that fact several
days after the six women had sailed
for China,
When Mr. Woodworth was shown
the dispatch last night he admitted
that he had filed complaint with the
Department of Justice against Com
missioner North. Mr. Woodworth
said:
One day last November Mr. North came
Into my office in the Appraiser's building frum
his office on the upper floor and notified me
of the statements that had been made by the
six women at St. Louis to Mr. Dunn. "Wh-ra
are those women?" I asked. "'Have >'ju
them in custody?" Tlu-n he told me they
had sailed for China eight or nine days be-
If we could have used these Women on
the trial of L* TÂ»y and I>a Silva I have no
doubt we could . have obtained a conviction.
I therefore deemed It my duty to flle an
ofnYial complaint with the Department of Jus
tice.
Mr. North said last night that he
did not believe the United States At
torney had filed a complaint against
him. He said that the women sailed
for China on November 26, of last
year, and that he received Mr. Dunn's
report two days afterward. As soon
as he received the report he took it
to Mr. Woodwdrth. He said:
The department then took up the matter
and I wired them whether thÂ»- wmuw could
not. be stopped and brmirht back, but noth
ing was done in the matter that X know of
and the affair was dropped.
FERRY POSTOFJ'ICE
WILL BE ABOLISHED
Mail Will Be Taken to the New Build
ing and Then Distributed to
the Trains.
The Postmaster General notified
Postmaster, Fisk yesterday that the I
department has decided to abolish the p
postofflce station at the Market-street j
1 ferry upon the completion of the new j
j Government building at the corner of '
Seventh and Mission streets. All mall
will be transported from the new j
building to the ferry in the most ex-
I peditious manner. The force now em- I
ployed at the Ferry postofflce will be !
j transferred to the new building-. The!
i Postmaster General says that the best i
; possible' service will be given. Post- j
master Fisk, Superintendent A. H. j
j Stephens of the railway mail service
j andr Harry B. Hall have transmitted
to Washington ; their report upon the I
â¢ "comparative tests with automobiles
and wagons in collecting and deliver- j
ing mail-in this city. They made no
recommendation. They have report
j'ed that mail can be taken by the Mis
sion-street electric road from the new 'â 
j postofflce building to the ferry in elev
j en : minutes, but there Is always the â¢
I risk of delay by vehicles obstructing
I the railroad j track.

HEARTY WELCOME GIVEX

Loyal Parishioners of Sacred Heart
Church Greet Their Popular
New Rector.
A royal welcome was given last
night to the Rev. Father McQuaide,
the new pastor of Sacred Heart
Church and successor of the late

held in the basement of the church
and was presided over by Thomas H.
Fallon. Philip Fay delivered the ad
dress of welcome to Father McQuaide,
who made a feeling response. On the
platform with the new pastor was the
Rev. Father Philip Byrne. The pro
gramme was given as follows:

SOCIAL DISSIPATION.
A young woman from a nearby town, I
who was recently visiting friends in
Cleveland, was taken sick at the theater.
It became necessary to call a doctor from
the audience, and one promptly appeared
at the manager's office to render her as
sistance. After learning- her symptoms,
he ordered her to take a Red Raven. She
was sent home in her carriage. When the
excitement was all over the manager
said to the doctor. "I would serve Red
Raven to every lady in my audience if I
thought it would keep them well." "That
is not exactly the idea," said the physi
cian. "ThiÃ is a particular case. This
young woman has been suffering from
too much social dissipation. She has
been going somewhere every night for
the last two or three weeks, no doubt. A
theater with refreshments afterward, a
party, a late dinner and decidedly too
many luncheons. Her system has become
overtaxed. Had she occasionally taken a
Red Raven she would readily have stood
this strain. As it was, she allowed her
self to break down. There is nothing
like Red Raven for people in her condi
tion. But the trouble is they do not all
know it." â¢
Produce Merchant Arrested.
J. F. Morris of the firm of Morris
Brothers & Co. was arrested yesterday
by W. H. Saylor, assistant secretary of
the State Dairy Bureau, on a charge
of selling renovated butter. The firm
has been shipping dairy produce to
Caspar, Mendocino County. The case
will go before Judge Fritz to-day.
BRAVELY FIGHTS
WITH A ROBBER
Proprietor of a Napa Hotel
Saves His Cash by Attack
ing a Bold Hold-Up Man
PUTS THIEF TO FLIGHT
Thug Drops Revolver After
Being Knocked Down and
Manages to Make Escape
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NAPA, Feb. 6.â A bold attempt to
rob the Geneva Hotel Saturday night
was frustrated by the courage of one of
the proprietors, D. Daglis.
Daglis was about to close up thÂ»
hotel bar when a stranger who had
been hanging about the place all day
ordered him to throw hiÃ hands up.
Daglis obeyed, and was about to hand
over the money In the till when he no
ticed that two of the chambers in the
revolver held by the bandit were empty.
Quick as a flash Daglis struck the rob
ber and knocked him down and then
jumped upon him. During the strug
gle that followed the thief dropped thÂ»
revolver and with a quick move threw
Daglis to one side, scrambled to his feet
and darted away.
Three of the chambers of the revolver
were found to be empty. The weapon
and a soft hat left behind by the
would-be thief were turned over to
Sheriff Dunlap by Daglis to-day when
he reported the occurrence.
Fraternal Eagles.
The Beventh anniversary of tha
founding of the Fraternal Order of
Eagles was celebrated last night In
Native Sons' Hall by San Francisco
and Golden Gate aeries of this city. A
pleasing programme delighted about

lowed by dancing for two hours.

FRED E. MULHOLLAND
Too much enthusiasm on the part
â¢C Willie Daly prevented the backers
of his father's horse. Play Ball, from
cashing their pasteboards, after the
fourth event at Oakland yesterday.
The distance was one and an eighth
miles, and Play Ball alternated with
Barney Dreyfuss in setting the pace.
About opposite the trainers' stand it
looked as if both Erne, the favorite,
ridden by Knapp. and Barney also
â¢were going to make It decidedly inter
esting for the Daly entry. Willie now
threw discretion to the winds and his
mount badly bumped both of the two
contenders mentioned. Every little
helped at the stage of proceedings, and
Play. Ball led Barney Dreyfuss out a
length at the wire. Erne finishing
third. On Knapp lodging a'cteim of
foul with the judges, the winner was
placed back In third position, the
purse being awarded to Dreyf uss, and
Erne placed second. The decision ap
peared to give satisfaction, as the
rcugh riding was apparent to all.
A track which was heavy and dry
in spots caused a number of upsets.
After four choices had been dethroned,
Cmcinnatus and Soufriere came
through, carrying â  some big commis
sions.
Meada, a black filly from the stable
â¢f Bianchi & McGovern. was heaviiy
played at odds of 6 to 6 to win the
opening event. She displayed a spark
of speed and then falling- back finished
last. Miller's Daughter a 10 and 15
to 1 shot, backed dowi to 7, took the
lead in the stretch, winning handily
from Mabel Bates and San Jose.
A recent arrival from Los Angeles,
Agnes Mack took the Futurity course
run following. Piloted by "Kig Bill"
Knapp the mare outfooted Revolt
ihrouprh the stretch, scoring by nearly
a length. Greenock, the favorite,
eeemed slow in leaving the barrier and
after an uneven voyage ran into the
show.
If Charley McCafferty's Dr. Leggo
was short previous time out he was
lung on speed in the five and a half
furlong purse number. Tramotor, nicely
broiled over a charcoal flame, was
d at 7 to 10. the early comers rv
mewtuil under this. Th<>
medal brigade picked the twos about
xhf- more edible morsel.
Superb judgrment was thus shown, for
the favorite took a transfer for the tall
and uncut timber iji the stretch, and
the Doctor, which had been waiting
uith marked patience under Bonner,
sneezed in by three lengths. Alarie
landed E .odun third.
sibly had Modicum been wheeled
around the track in an invalid chair
â !d warrior might have won the
sellinp affair. As it v.-as he fin
. third, vainly trying to find a soft
tor his poor old feet. Oineinnatus,
ihe favorite, with Alarie up. ran under
lint to the stretch. Then given
:â¢ ad ;he Rlute entry ran over Isa
nning with considerable to
is pare.
After a couple of unsuccessful essays
Soufriere finally annexed a purse. The
mare's price fell from T to 5 to 11 to It
in the betting on the last, a seven fur
run, and she won all the way.
rland went back in the betting
and encountering a gale off Shell
Mound Park and just escaping a loose
Chinese typhoon In latitude 23. near
Wash House Point, was docked in pier
S by Skipper Michaels. Foncasta. with
Knapp up, proved the contender
throughout, finishing a good second.

to Quit Winged "O" of His Own
Accord.
Sam Berger last night voluntarily
turned in his resignation as a. member
of the Olympic Club. Berger has
signed to meet Jim Casey before the
San Francisco Club on -February 17
and decided to quit the club as the
board of directors would not sanction
his meeting with the longshoreman.
Berger says he thought he could
not get enough practice at the home
of the winged "O" and saw no future
for him there as a boxer. He did not
consult the directors before taking the
step and therefore his resignation
comes as a mild surprise.

WHITE ABHORS
LAWYER CLUNIE
Solemnly Swears He Will
Never Talk to Enemy
Two Minutes on Earth
The renewal of the Clunie -Bridgford-
Wblte feud In Judge Coffey's court yes
terday produced another "mystery"
and at least one fair exchange of per
sonalities. Andrew J. Clunie, by insin
uating interrogatories, roughly criti
cized Burrell G. White for withholding
from him, Clunie, as coexecutor infor
mation regarding the "purported exist
ence of a false deed," by which Mrs.
Florence Clunie had transferred all of
her community property to General
Clunie at the time they severed their
marital relations. **
White was angered, and by the time
his questioner had several times repeat
ed the charge that information regard
ing affairs of the estate had been with
held from him the witness vouchsafed
a reason. "We haven't spoken for six
months outside this room," said White,
"and I will not speak to you unless I
have to."
"Oh, don't let that worry you," Inter
rupted Clunie, and White went on:
"I'll never have another conversation
with you for two minutes at a time If
I live to be twenty-five years older.
You misrepresent what is said, and put
Into a man's mouth words that never
passed his lips."
Clunie merely chuckled and continued
his examination, dealing with a matter
of installing a new heating plant In ttie
theater at Sacramento, during the
course of which he asked whether the
lessees of the building had not offered
to employ White to get a ten years' re
newal of their lease while the old lease
had nearly four years to run. White
denied the implied employment, but
said the matter of a renewal for five
years had been mentioned.
Judge E. A. Bridgford, the other ex
ecutor, was called to the stand for en
other round of questioning. Ciunie
seemed to take much delight In pro
pounding the same query live times in
an effort to get a direct ansv.-er that
would meet with his approval. The
line of examination had to do with
what information White had imparted
to Bridgford regarding the former's
knowledge or belief that Mrs. CJunie
had signed a deed to property with
out knowing the contents of the in
strument. Bridgford said that White
had not told him the details of the
transaction involving the blanket
deeds, but "it was intimated that Mrs.
Clunie was not fully Informed as to
what she was doing."
Clunie asked Bridgford how he first
came into possession of the deed to the
property in question. The witness an
swered that it had been given tciiim in

SAYS COACHES
IMBIBE FREELY
Editor of "Occident" Grills
Stars Who Come Here to
Train Football Players
THEY SET BAD EXAMPLE
Editorial in the Student
Publication Causes Mild
Sensation in Berkeley
Berkeley OfPce San Francisco Call.
. 2148 Center Street, Feb. 6.
The starting allegation is made offi
cially to-day'by I<eo D. Bishop in the
editorial columns of the university
magazine called the Occident that the
professional coaches who were utilized
by California up to three years ago
failed largely because they were wine
drinkers and ho unable to keep their
men in line. â
Bishop is assistant manager of the
university football team. Ezra Decoto
being his chief. The Occident Is edit
ed by Bishop, and his editorial to-day
on the subject of graduate coaches,
perhaps the livest topic at the uni
versity, has created a sensation. Never
before has it been definitely stated that
the high-priced, exclusive and fashion
able university men of the East who
came to California to train gridiron
players were too fond of wine, but
Bishop, who is supposed to be quali
fied to speak, makes the charge with
out equivocation.
Tho editorial which has caused such
a sensation is apropos of the decision
of the intercollegiate agreement com
mittee, representing Stanford and Cal
fornia, to give up the â graduate-coach
exclusively" feature of the agreement.
Bishop is one of the three representa
tives of ttie University of California
who procured a fortnight ago the
change in policy. The action of the
Intercollegiate committee has not yet
h?en ratified by the executive commit
tee of the associated students of the
university, anrl cannot become a reg
ulation until it is thus ratified- The
committee meets to-morrow night. Last
week it met, but failed to approve the
action of its representatives who had
conferred with Stanford.
At this juncttire comes Bishop with
his editorial, which lifts the cover from
the situation as it existed a few years
ago, when professional coaches were
used. Bishop says:
Tha Intercollegiate agreement committees
have met ani agreed on certain rules regard
ing athletics. The most important thing that
was done is the omission cf article 5, relating
to the employment of graduate coaches. A
good many people are dissatisfied betausÂ« some
provision was not made whereby the system
Inaugurated four . years ' ago might be per
petuated. It ' is said that the graduate rule
was put In force because we had euch poor
success with Eastern men. These fellow* came
out hera ion a lark from the Kast and spent
a good part of their time over the bottle. Tlietr
conduct was such that it set a bad example
for the players. They Instilled a professional
spirit into the men â the spirit that all the
colleges In America have been fighting against.
No doubt the change made at that time as
beneficial. ' But we must analyze the conditlcntt
under which we are now laboring. California
has no man that can be pointed to as the coach
for the coming year. The football players al
most to a man are in favor of a change. More
over, .the feeling is so Intense over tho ques
tion that a graduate coach, it seems to us,
would fail vttcrly to bring out the best there is
In the men. <
Professor George C. Edwards, chair
man of the faculty committee on ath
letics, which operates with the execu
tive committee of the students In reg
ulating athletic affairs, is strongly op
posed to a return to professional
coaches. It Is his opposition which Is
believed to stand In the way of ratifi
cation of the intercollegiate agreement
committee's work.

Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
NEW YORK, Feb. 6.â Two matches
were made this afternoon in which the
Attell brothers figure very prominently.
Abe Attell. who was recently the means
of pushing Tommy Murphy back one
peg in the piigilistic ladder, has been
matched with Eddie Hanlon. They will
meet before the Industrial Club of Phil
adelphia.
The best weight that Hanlon would
make for Attell was 130 pounds at 3
o'clock. In order to get the match At
tell had to accept the terms. This will
be a big handicap, as Attell can easily
do 122 pounds ringside. In fact, he did
that for Tommy Murphy only two
weeks aso.
Monte Attell. conqueror of Johnny
Regan, has been matched with Jimmy
Walsh, .the Boston bantam. They arÂ»
to box twenty rounds at 116 pounds be
fore the Commercial Athletic Club of
St. Louis on February 14.
LADIES TO COMPETE
FOR COUNCIL'S CTP
Second Contest for Trophy Begins To-

Golf Club.
The second competition held during
the present season among the ladies
of the San Francisco Golf and Coun
try Club for the Council's cup for
women will begin this morning on thÂ«
links on the military reservation at
the Presidio. The drying wind of th<Â»
last two days has greatly lmprov-l
the condition of the course. The
Qualifying round over eighteen fa
medal score, should be played this
morning, but it is likely that the la
dies will dispense with this and will
proceed at once to the opening round
of match play. Among the ladies who
will probably take part are Mis.-Â«

Coach Cowden has arranged â¢ new
series of preliminary games for the
varsity baseball team. Under this
new schedule there will be games

a bunch of cardinal stickers than any
other system of work. The final
game between the two middle classes
will be played to-morrow and from
then on the varsity will be given all
the attention. The following is the
complete schedule of games:

TAINTED
Columbus, Ohio, May 19, 1903.
Some four years ago I was suffering
from impure blood and a general run-
down condition of the system. I had no
appetite, was losing flesh, and had an all-
gone tired feeling that made me misera-
ble. I began the nse of S . S. S., and
after taking seven or eight bottles my skin
was cleared of all eruptions and took on a
ruddy, healthy glow that assured me that
my blood had been restored to its nor-
mal, healthy condition. My appetite was
restored, as I could eat anything put be-
fore me, and as I regained my appetite
I increased in weight, and that 'tired feel-
ing" which worried " me so much disap-
peared, and I was once again my old3elÂ£.
-. I 'heartily recommend S. S. S. as the
best blood purifier and tonic made, and
strongly advise its nse to all those in need
of such medicine. Victor Stubbihs.
Cor. Barthman and Washington Ayes.
Wheeling, W. V., May 28. MM,
My system was run down and my joints
ached and pained me considerably. I had
used S. S. S. before and : knew what it
was, so I purchased a bottle of it and have
taken several bottles and the aches and
pains are gone, my blood has been cleas-
ed and mv general health built up. I can
testify to it as a blood purifier and tonic.

TbÂ« Swift Specific Company, AtFmnta,' 6a,
iSEW GOVERNOR OF TAHITI AND SOUTH SEA PEARL KING
LEAVE HERE TO-DAY ON THE LINER MARIPOSA.
Oceanic Company's SteamsMD to Take Manu Passengers
Will Carry a Real
American Circus
to Papeete.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's
hner Mariposa, Captain Lawless, will
leav* Pacific-street wharf at 11 o'clock
this morning for Tahiti. She will carry
a large number of passengers, includ- |
ing a Governor General, a pearl king
and a circus troupe, as well as many
travelers seeking health and recreation.
The Mariposa also will take a good
sized cargo of general merchandise.
E. Jullien, the new Governor General
of Tahiti, with his wife, daughter,
mother-in-law, secretary and suite,
will sail on the Mariposa. Governor
Jullien. as the representative of the
French Government, will occupy a po
sition of great authority and high re
sponsibility in South Sea affairs. He
comes direct from Paris and is looking
forward with great pleasure to an ex
tended sojourn in a beautiful land
where it is always summer.
Emil Levy, the pearl king of the
South Seas, is returning on the Mari
posa to his fishing grounds. He will
be accompanied by his wife, with
whom he has been traveling in Europe. <
Levy visits the Old World every year
in connection with his business.
Among the other passengers are
Kastern tourists and some Californians
who have been Induced to take the
voyage by the stories of friends who
have visited Tahiti and ever since have
talked enthusiastically of their delight
ful experiences in the South Seas and
on the way to and from Papeete.
And of most importance to young
Tahiti, the Mariposa is taking down a
small but real American circus. The
troupe is only nine strong and there
will be but a one-ring show, but* the
dusky youngsters of that tropical isle
are not so critical as young America,
and a circus is a circus, anyhow or
anywhere.
Following is a list of the Mariposa's
passengers:
Mrs. H. O. Beatty and maid, P. F Butler.

Levies on Trumbo's Team.
Colonel Isaac Trumbo, whose min
ing, matrimonial and political ven
tureÃ have afforded topics for conver
sation here and in Utah for several
years past, is in danger of losing his
team of blacks and his victoria for
non-payment of a livery bill. W. E.
Bridge, proprietor of the St. Law
rence stables, filed a lien yesterday
upon the property, alleging that the
colonel owes him $350 for care and
board of the team. The liveryman
gays the outfit was placed in his
âºcharge last July and the colonel
agreed to pay $50 a month, but up to
January 31 no money was forthcom
ing. The liveryman has the horses
and carriage and proposes to keep
them until the bill is settled.

Supervisors Grant Permit
to Reconstruct the Cali
fornia Street Steam Road
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
passed the ordinance granting permis
sion to the United Railroads to use
electricity as a motive power on that
portion of the California street and
Cliff House road now operated as a
steam road. It lies between Parker and
First avenues.
The ordinance imposes a condition
to which the company has agreed â
that in the reconstruction ot the Cliff
House steam line, of which' the above
is a portion, iron poles shall be used
instead of wooden poles along Califor
nia street from Parker avenue to
Eighth avenue.
E. P. Troy filed a fiery communica
tion, which was referred to the Street
Committee, calling on the board to tear
up the curve track at Post and Kearny
streets because the use of the curve
was abandoned about eighteen years
ago, and under the charter the fran
chise has been forfeited by non-use.
Troy wants the company to establish
its rights in court, and not by taking
forcible possession of the streets.
The board accepted a deed from the
Sutro estate to lands for the opening
of Sutro Heights avenue from Forty
sixth to Forty-eighth avenues, between
A and B streets.
The board ordered grades to be
changed on Holly Park avenue and
West Park street.
A demand was drawn in favor of J.
H. Dockweiler for services as engineer

APPEAL COURT
REVERSES CASES
Sailor Wiberg Loses Four
Thousand* Dollars Through
an Overturned Judgment
BANK WINS ITS POINT
Eights of Street Cars Are
Laid Down by the Learned
Judges of Federal Bench
Judges Gilbert, Ross, Hawley and
Morrow, sitting as the United States
Circuit Court of Appeals, handed down
the following decisions yesterday:
Thomas Pollard et al., claimants and
owners of the American steamer West
port, vs. Elias Wibergâ Northern Dis
trict of Californiaâ Judgment reversed
and the cause remanded to the court
below with directions to dismiss the
libel at libelant'g cost. In the United
States District Court judgment was
given in favor of Wiberg for $4500 dam
ages for personal injuries caused by
the giving ,way of a capstan on board
the Westixjrt. The appellate court
says:
It is also a fact that the record contain* no
I evidence that the capstan in question was un-
I safe, insufficient or unfit for any service for
which it was Intended, but on the contrary
j shows without conflict that the libelant witn
I the other seamen working with him had, by
means of this capstan, drawn in the slack of
| this particular hawser, for which the hawser
I had been, by the master's order, transferred
| from the bitts to the capstan. â¢ â¢ â¢ In so
! far, therefore, as the equipment of the steam
| er is concerned, it is impossible to see where
; her owners were negligent. Nor is it claimed
that the officers of the vessel were, in any
respect, incompetent.
As has already been said, there was no evi
dence that the place where the libelant was
hurt was unsafe unless the improper use of
the capstan for Hie purpose of hauling the
vessel from the mud alongside the wharf made
it so. And if it be true that the master did
undertake to accomplish that result by means
of the capstan, as testified by the libelant and
by two of the other sailors, while it would
show negligence upon the part of the master, :
it would be the negligence of a fellow servant ;
of the libelant for which tke owner would not
be liable.
The United States of America vs. ;
the Wishkah Boom Companyâ Wash- j
ington â Decree reversed and cause re
manded.
The Aetna Indemnity Company vs.
William M. Ladd and others, doing
business as Ladd & TiltonâWashing
tonâJudgment affirmed.
The Empire State-Idaho Mining and
Developing Company and American
Bonding Company vs. Kennedy J.
Hanieyâ ldaho â Decree affirmed.
The Pacific Packing and Navigation
Co. vs. W. B. Fieldingâ Washington-
Judgment reversed and cause re
manded.
Santa Fe Pacific Railroad Company ;
vs. Laurete Holmes â Arizona â Judg
ment affirmed.
London and San Francisco Bank,
Limited, vs. James N. Block, as Tax
Collector of the City and County of
San Francisco â This was an action in
equity for an injunction restraining
Block from collecting a tax of $12,000
for franchise; $14,576, amount due by
J. P. Morgan & Co.; $116774, due by
the Portland Branch, and $428,539. due
by the Tacoma Branch. The court
says:
The only question for this court to decide is
whether the court below erred in holding that
the items due from the Portland branch and
the Tacoma branch were assessable as solvent
credits taxable in California. â¦ â¢ The au
thority of every Statp to tax all property, real
and personal, within its jurisdiction is un
questionable, but the taxing power of the
j State is limited, in a case of this character, to
property within the State. Under the fact* of I
: this case our conclusion is that the court
erred in holding that the two items under con
sideration aggregating $543,313. upon which
the tax waa $7634. were property assessable to ;
appellant as solvent credits. The decree of j
the Circuit Court as to the allowance of the i
tax and penalties on these two Items Is re- j
versed and th? cause remanded to the court j
below to strike out this portion of the decree
and make such further order In the premises
as the case may require, in accordance with
the views expressed in this opinion.
M. E. Rogers et al. vs. the De Soto
Placer Mining Companyâ Alaska-
Judgment reversed and cause re
manded.
Los Angeles Traction Company vs.
John Martin Conneally et al. In this
case the court says:
The rights of street cars, no matter by what
j powerfimpelled, are not superior to those of
1 other vehicles, save in the one Instance where j
i a vehicle is bound to get out of the way, and
not to obstruct the passage of the car owing
i to the inability of the car to travel in any
other part of the street. The element of tres- I
I pass is entirely absent in the case of a person
' cropping a street railway at any point, and the
' only care required of him is that which a
; reasonably prudent man would exercise hay
: ing due regard to the rights of others and as
suming that others (Including the street car
companies) will exercise the same care: in
: fact, knowing that such care Is imposed by
i municipal regulation upon the persons operat
â  ing the street cars. This assumption does not.
! of course, warrant such a reliance upon it as
! to neglect means of self-preservation, but Is
! an element of consideration in arriving at the
i standard of care to govern the particular case.
i'For the error pointed out above the judgment
' is reversed and the cause remanded for a new
trinl.

Company â California â Judgment re

ACCUSES MILES
OF BRUTALITY
Stinging Denunciation of
the General by Daugh
ter of Jefferson Davis
CALLS HIM INHUMAN
Says Her Mother Was Sub
jected to Insult When
Visiting State Prisoner
Special Dispatch to The Call.
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., Feb. 6.
General Nelson A. Miles' alleged true
story of the treatment accorded Jeffer
son Davis at Fortress Monroe and the
latter's alleged connection with the
assassination of Lincoln has aroused
Mrs. J. A. Hayes, daughter of Jeffer
son Davis and wife of the president of
the First National Bank of this city.
Mrs. Hayes says:
"I thought that the accusation that
my father was implicated in the as
sassination of Abraham Lincoln had
been so thoroughly exploded as to no
longer receive the consideration of in
telligent people. I remember distinct
ly what my father said wnen ha heard
of Lincoln's death. I was with my
father when he was captured in the
woods of Georgia. When he heard that
Lincoln had been killed ne said: 'This
is the bitterest blow that could have
struck the South. Lincoln was a good
and just man, according to the light
given him.'
"If Lincoln had lived, my father
would never have been subjected to
the treatment he received at the hands
of General Miles. The worst brute
could not have been more brutal than
was Miles to my father. He treated
Mr. Davis as a felon or murderer might
have been treated and not as a state
prisoner.
"Lieutenant Colonel John J. Craben,
who was my father's physician and a
Northern man. tells or the Inhuman
treatment meted out to my father by
Miles, in the book he has written on the
subject of my father's Imprisonment.
Miss Anna Craben, daughter of Dr.
Craben, personally cooked my father's
food, for fear he would be poisoned."
Mrs. Hayes told of insults to which
she says her mother was subjected
when the latter went to visit her father,
then beloved to be In a dying condi
tion.
"General Miles insulted my mother."
said Mrs. Hayes, "and my father, feeble
and emaciated as he was, shook the
iron gratings of his cell and said to
Miles:
" 'If I could get at you, I would tear
you limb from limb.' "
FRUIT DEALERS BUYING
FROM CALIFORNIA VTRECT
Chicago No Longer a Distributing Cen
ter for Towns Around Lake
Michigan.
BENTON HARBOR. Mich., Feb. Â«.
Fruit men say that Chicago Is losing
trade as a California fruit distributor.
For years the big market at the head
of the lake has been distributing near
ly all of the oranges and other Cali
fornia fruit among the larger towns
near Chicago in three States. Now,
however, carloads are shipped direct
ly to the small towns.
The freight on a carload of oranges
from California to Benton Harbor is
the same as to Chicago and is given
out at $350. Several Illinois towns
and many in Wisconsin are now get
ting their fruit from California groves,
the freight rate being such that di
rect shipment is advisable.

TO SORT MAILS
ON THE LINERS
New Postal Agreement Being
Drawn Up by Uncle Sam
With France and England
INCLUDES PARCEL POST
Americans Visit Europe for
the Purpose of Bringing
About the Desired Kesult
PARIS, Feb. B.â W. S. Bhallenberger,
Second Assistant Postmaster General of
the Postoffice Department of the United
States, has completed an arrangement
with the PostofHce Department here
and in London, which is expected to
bring about a number of important
changes in handling trans-Atlantio
mails. Shallenberger said to-day:
The decisions are tÂ«ntatlve, but ax* snfS
ciently advanced ta Indicate that thÂ«Â« Is na
doubt of their â¢atlifaciorr conclusion. T_ ar
rangement Includes:
First, sorting the mails oa board steam
ships so as to be ready for distribution *hÂ«*
they arrive at New York; second, readjustment
' of the transcontinental railroad charges for
carry British malls acroaa the United Stsvtas
to and from Australia.; third, parcel posts be
tween the United States aud England and thÂ«
United States and France.
The trip of Shallenberger-and Maatea
followed a conference with First As
sistant Postmaster General Wynne at
which it was decided to make an effort
to settle these long pending questions.
The Americana say they found the of
ficials In London and Paris ready to co
operate so that little remains to be set
tled except the details and the ratifica
tion by the authorities at Washington.
The sorting of the malls will be In
augurated by the White Star Line oa
April 5 on their steamships sailing both
â ways, and later. It is expected, will be
extended to other lines so aa to cover
all the heavy trans- Atlantic mails. Tha
system to .be adopted on board thÂ»
steamships is the same as is in use on
American railroad cars.
The parcel posts arrangements con
template the conveyance of package*
up to four and a half pounds at the
rate of 12 cents a pound under similar
conditions to . the present German-
American parcels post. Heretofore the
service has been carried on through tho
express companies and will continue so
with packages over four and a half
pounds. .
Shallenberger considers the English
arrangement settled and says tho
French arrangement only awaits th 9
adjustment of details which are not
considered serious. The advantages se
cured are such that probably some
modification will be made in the
charges for carylng foreign mails on
the American railroads. Shallenberger
and Masten, who are highly gratified
with the results of their trip, left Paris
to-day on their return to Washington.
BAN ON EVIL PICTURES.
America Will Ask France to Prevent
Mailing of Them.
PARIS, Feb. 6.â Following the
complaint of Anthony Comstock of
New York concerning demoralizing
French pictures being received in
America through the French malls,
the State Department at "Washington
is seeking the co-operation, of th*
French Government to prevent tha
mailing of objectfbnable photographs
or pictures.
YOUNG NEGRESS OPERATES
AS BURGLAR IN CHICAGO
Hires Out as Laundress to Study
Houses She Intends
To Rob.
CHICAGO, Feb. 6. â In the arrest of
I "Birdie" Brookes, alias Spears, a 19
' year-old negro girl, the police believe
they have solved most qt the myste
rious burglaries that have taken plaeÂ»
in Hyde Park and YVoodJawn resi
dences this winter. The rrtethod used
by the "woman burglar" wax to hirÂ«
out as a laundress for a few days un
til she learned the arrangement of the
house. The night after her departure
the house would be rifled of Jewelry.
In the room where the girl was
found was a quantity of stolen prop
erty. With her occasional assistance.
for she claims she "can't remember
all the houses she robbed," the po
lice have identified 1 a number of Â«to
len articles.
Th e biggest robbery with which the
police believe the girl was connected
is that of the residence of Professor
Frederick Locard of the Hyde Park
High School. Wearing apparel, jewelry,
old coins and silverware valued at
$1600 were taken from this house on
the night of January 7.
WOXTLD HAVE BOXING

New York State Senator to Introdnc*
Bill Adding to the
Curriculum.
NEW YORK. Feb. Â«.â State Sena*
tor Luke A. Keenan. representing
President Roosevelt's home district at
Albany, has caught the boxing fever.
It Is understood that he contracted
the malady when he read the press
reports about what President Roose
velt and his boys had done recently to
Professor "Mike" Donovan.
Senator Keenan believes that box-
Ing should be added to the public
school curriculum in New York. HÂ«
has drawn up a bill to put his notion
into effect and has arranged to meet
leading educators for the purpose of
obtaining their views on Jabs and up
percuts.
Keenan believes that the cost of

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
Future Grain nnd Provisions.
CHICAGO, Feb. 6.â DiÃpelllng of fears' that
fall-sown wheat had been damaged brought
out liberal liquidation in the - : wheat ; pit ' to
day/ At the close May _ was off %@%c l and
July -%@%c. â '" Corn and oats are practically
unchanged. Provisions ; are up 2%@7%c.
â â â  The weakness in th^ wheat market developed
late in the day. a fairly firm tone being man
ifested ' early. At the opening . May was . vn '
changed to .He higher at |91 17@1 17% - and
â¢July unchanged to %c higher at $l*o2'g'l 02%.;
An active demand lor July by short"* was the
feature ;of .trading during the first â¢ hour. Pit
traders nevertheless showed an inclination to
sell May -owing to ; the fact â  that : cables . were
only a : trifle higher in face of a 2c advance
here Saturday.. Weekly statistics were gen
erally construed as rather bearish, world'B
bhipment& being large and the amount on pas
sage being considerably increased. - A ' heavy
fall of snow â  throughout the : Weet and | South
west practically, insuring the winter, wheat crop
from damage by. cold weather was a bearish
factor when . trading began, - but - â  apparently
under estimated until later 'In * the day. All
the . influences . named had â  a depressing effect
on the market. Later many traders ; who had
bought July . wheat last weÂ»k ; turned sellers.
Prices gradually yielded to the pressure. Dur
ing, the last half hour the market 1 became quite
weak, May Belling off to *l K>%<S>l 16% and
'July â  to- $1 01%.; The closing : was -almost at
the lowest point of the day, final quotations
on May being at $1 li V"' 10 1 July closed
at Â§1 C1%Â®1.01%.': ' "â  : - - /. v.
The corn . market was subjected ;to ' consid
erable bu;. ins by commission â  houses, but
prices showed only a slight decline.'- The par
ticular reason for the steadiness of the market
was a decrease in the visible supply. â¢;- May
closed unchanged from yesterday at 45iiÂ©4Â«Â»*ic.
Trading Jin cats was , largely of :a - scalping
rnturc. The market wai steady, "prices show
in>: very little fluctuation. \- May closed at
30%@30^c. Â :-:. .;
Provisions ,were quiet and firm. Sentiment
wajs Influenced mainly by , decreased , receipts
of live hogrs. At the close â  May pork â â  was -up

continued urgent â much better than that for

Company Files Statements
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
referred to the Street Committee for
further Investigation, the proposed or
dinance granting the Atchison. Topeka
and Santa Fe Railway Company a
franchise to operate a steam road along
Sixteenth, Indiana, Mariposa and other
street connecting therewith.
Captain A. H. Payson. vice president
Cf the company, addressed the board,
eayir.g that' he had offered Annie
Toomey, who protested against the
franchise. $400 for damages that he
caused her property. Payscn said he
â¢was willing to submit her claim to ar
b!traiion by the Street Committee.
"""Regarding the protest flied by the
J>hrke Estate Company against the
Â«rant of franchise on the ground that
its property on Indiana and Mariposa
streets would be injured. Payson said
the property was two blocks away from
the proposed line. Payson said that
the Indiana, street tracks had been laid
eo:ne yeans ago under another fran
chise and M. Lehrke had vastly im
proved hie property since the tracks
â were there.
Supervisor Boxton desired to know if
any provision would be made for pro
tecting pedestrian traffic at the cross
ings. Payson assured him that all
safeguards would be installed in that
connection at the six or seven cross-
Ings of the road. Supervisor Connor
explained that the road was in fact
a spur track to connect the Santa Fe
man, line with the industrial centers of
the city.
Attorneys for the protestants raised
th- i."int that as the Santa Fe Com
pany has already been granted a fran
chise to enter the city and connect
â¢with the water front the Supervisors
could not legally grant any more privi
leges of the same character.
Boxton's motion that the ordinance
be re-referred to the Street Committee
which recommended Its passage, for
the purpose of settling the protestants'
claims, was carried. The City Attorney
may be asked for an opinion as to the i
legal point noted. The committee will
mwt on Wednesday, February 15. at 3
p. m. &*.S''
In reply to questions put by Eggers,
who presided at the meeting. Payson
eaid the Eighteenth and Nineteenth
etreet bridges would be completed at
the earliest possible date, the former in
thirty days and the latter as soon as a
retaining wall to cost $20,000 can be
built. Supervisors Lunstedt and Eg
gers insisted that the residents in the
vicinity should be given relief.
The dispute over the resolution par
celing out the horreshoelng contracts
among seven bidders was resumed.
D'Ancona moved as a substitute that
the entire award be made to Ed. Tay
at $2 2a per hors*-. N. Morrisey, presi
dent of the Master Horseshoers' Asso
ciation, asserted that Tay was not re
sponsible and had caused trouble to the
craft when he was a walking delegate
of the Horseshoers' Union. The matter
was then deferred one week to give
Tay an opportunity to disprove the al
legation that he is not a responsible
bidder.
The beginning of .the annual investi
gation for the fixing of water rates had
b^-n made a special order and several
officials of the Spring Valley Water
Company were present to be ques
tioned. The usual resolutions directing
thÂ«- company to furnish statements
showing: its revenue and operating ex
penses for 1904 and the clerk to ascer
tain its assessed valuation were adopt
ed. Braunhart said that the inquiry
would not take long, as a mass of evi
dence had been taken in investigations
for three years past, and it would only
bf necessary to question the company's
representatives relative to the. accrued
property ol the company. The inquiry
â¢will be formally begun on Tuesday.
February 14, at 2 p. m.
The .^tatemer.ts asked for were filed
immediately, showing the company had
expended $437,965 S9 in permanent im
provements in 1904. The receipts were

POLICE COURT ADVOCATE
PROVES HIS PROWESS
PUNCHES CAPPER FOR RIVAL
Irate Lawyer Attacks a Prisoner Who
Interferes With His Trade.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Primarily responsible for the incident
was an infringement of the rule that
forbids attorneys to solicit business
from prisoners in a courtroom. If that
regulation had been strictly observed
the crowd in Po!lce Judge Mogan's
tribunal would have missed the rare
spectacle of an act of battery commit
ted fairly within the shadow of the
bench. Of course the bench was not oc-
cupied at the time, else the subsequent
proceedings would certainly have been
mrrre interesting.
It was just after the male defendants
had been horded into the cage and prior
to the Judge's arrival that one erf the
energetic professional advocates ap
proached the bars and wigwagged his
d<-sire to converse with owe of UK In
mates, John Daly, accused <--f attempt

tion wht>n his shoulder was tapped

charged with woman- beating, who
audibly advised him to have nothing tn
do with the man who was talking, but
to entrust his case to a rival pleader,
name mentioned, who "hez forgot more
about de law dan dat mug efer learnt."
Whereupon the fist of the attorney shot
between the bars and landed upon the
bridge o-f Mr. Krens' nose. The as
sailed one staggered backward, clutch
ing his bruised proboscis, and. without
attempting to resume hia interrupted
?"li< itation of Mr. Daly's patronage,
the assailant departed the spot.
As neither of the two bailiffs wit
nessed the assault â indeed if their at
tention had not been monopolized by
oth^r business the attorney's visit to
the <age would not have occurred â no
arrest wap made. But in the corridors
the incident was much discussed, and
disinterested opinion had it that the
end was not yet.
The trick r:f employing a prisoner to
work among his fellows in the interest
of an attorney is not by any means
new. but never in local Police Court
history was it so openly exposed as by
the interference of Mr. Krens and the
resultant damage to his nasal organ.
Luke Dolan. laborer, quarreled with
his wife at their home, 215 Harrison
street, and two policemen arrested him
for drunkenness and peace disturb
ance. His better half said he was a
decent man when sober, and he ex- s
hiblted to Judge Cabaniss a certificate
of good character supplementing his
honorable discharge from the United
States army.
"Possession of that document should
mak? your conduct all the more ex
emplary, ' said his Honor, "for when
you offend the law you also attack the
integrity of tboac who have vo-uched
for your good 'behavior. Remember
that a reputation acquired by years of
commendable living may be shattered
by one day of misdoing. Go home,
keep sober and don't again betray
your Uncle Sam's confidence."
Patrolman J. J. Tillman was on fluti
st 2 o'clock Sunday morning when he
saw a man attempt to effect an en
trance to a number of stores on Third
street, between Howard and Mission,
by fumbling with locks and shoving
doors with a brawny shoulder. Failing
to obtain entrance to the barber shop
at 122. the man tried the saloon at 124,
then the saloon at 138. then the notion
store at 152, then the drug store at 162,
then the barber shop at 208, then the
tea store at 218. By that time the po
liceman had decided that there was no
hope of his catching a burglar with the
goods, so he emerged from concealment
and arrested the man and charged him
with having attempted to commit the
act. The defendant, who registered as
Charles H. Brown, pleaded that he
owned a lunch counter at 159 Third
street and was drunk and trying to find
it when the policeman interrupted his

hearing.

Patrolman George A. Sullivan was
also parading Third street at early
morning when he met two men who
were intoxicated and carrying between
them the dressed carcass of a sheep.
They gave the names of William An
derson and Elmer D. Gibson. Carl Mul
ler. a butcher, identified the mutton as
his property and the defendants are be
fore Judge Conlan. They pleaded com
plete ignorance as to how they became
possessed of the sheep.

Jefferson Davis Reese, 20 years of
age, is accused of having turned sev
eral dishonest pennies by delivering
messages marked "collect" to women
of the under world and disappearing
with the money thus obtained before
the envelope could be opened and the
contents read. The envelopes had been
purloined from the Western Union Tel
egraph Company, and each cpntained a
sheet of papef on which was written
an improper query. A woman of Hinck
ley place pursued the bogus messenger
and effected, his capture, and Judge
Mogan will hear her testimony to-day.
Thomas Campbell, arrested for loiter
ing in the O'Farrell street music halls
and accused of vagrancy, admitted to
Judge Fritz that he was an ardent ad
mirer of stage art and yearned to be a
"Johnnie," but was handicapped both
physically and pecuniarily in the at
tainment of his ambition, as the ladies
of the "profesh" were chary of smile

So long as his crayon portrait
adorned ihe sitt insr-room of his wife's
domicile at 91 PA Folsom street Peter
J. Carr. able soaman. could not con
sider himself entirely excluded from
her kindly consideration. True, she
had not only abandoned his com
panionship and gone to live alone,
supporting herself by selling notions
at retail, but she had also informed
him that she hoped to be spared the
affliction of ever seeing his face again.
Yet she clun? to the portrait which
he had given to her in the first flush
of their marital bliss. If she did not
w.int to se*Â» his countenance in the
flosh, why did she keep its limned pre
sentment where it confronted her
daily? There could be only one an
swer to the query. She still loved
him.
Hugging that sweet impression to
his >=oul Mr. Carr went to 919 A Fol
som street last Sunday evening and in
conciliatory tone requested admit
tance. The response was a vinegary
negative, supplemented with a threat
that if he did not at once begone the
police would be summoned. At which
Mr. Oirr laughed softly and assured
himself that she didn't mean a word
of it, but was merely angling for fur
ther blandishment. Instead of giving
her g n ntle insincerity, however, he
committed the fatal indiscretion of
indulging in sarcasm and informing
her of his opinion that if she didn't
love him she wouldnt keep his pic
ture. An instant later the air was
freighted with articles of his wearing
apparel hurled at him from the win
dow and when the textile ammuni
tion was exhausted out came his por
trait. Then the window was slammed
shut.
Mr. Carr was viciously kicking his
picture and loudly proclaiming his in
tention to serve in like maner the perv
son who threw it at him when Pa
trolmen Thompson and Nolan took
him in for malicious mischief and dis
turbing the peace. Judge Fritz is re
serving sentence.
"You'll come with me," said Patrol
man Alpers to Patrick Bean, found
drunk and incapable of pedestrianizing.
"I'll do nothing of the kind," said Pat
rick Bean to Patrolman Alpers. But he
d<d something of the kind, and when
Judge Conlan said to him, "Guess I'll
give you thirty days." he retorted by
exclaiming "Guess you'll do nothing of
the kind." And again he was wrong

When the case of eleven women
charged with having visited a poolroom
in a Polk street stationery store was
called before Judge Mogan only six of
the defendants responded, so the bail
of the absent five, amounting to $20
apiece, was ordered forfeited and bench
warrants issued for their arrest. Four
of those who did appear in court were
middle-aged and did not attempt to
hide their features, but the remaining
two were young and thickly veiled. The
arresting policemen testified that they
made the raid after a woman in their
employ had purchased a ticket from
Mrs. Grace Schwartz, wife of the man
who owned the stationery store, but as
the feminine detective did not appear
to prosecute the case went over till
next Saturday. Mrs. Schwartz, charged
with having sold pools, has demanded
a jury trial.
May Hooligan. Margaret Brown,
Clara Smith and Frank Lawrence were
also accused of visiting a lottery place,
a dry goods store kept by John Doe
McDonnell at 3242 Mission street, and
the case was continued till to-morrow
after the Judge had delivered to the fe
male defendants some remarks which
they did not seem to relish.
"It's a deplorable thing." he said.

The Board of Supervisors yesterday
received information that the State
Board of Examiners will put in a bid
for $269,400 of the earlier series of the
municipal school bonds on February 20,
when proposals for v large portion of
the bond issue will be opened.
The bid will enable the board to erect
two of the most urgently needed

Washington Grammar and Spring Val
ley schools. As the estimate of cost of'
each building is $110,000 there will be
ample funds for the erection of the two
schoolhouses, including the purchase of
additional ground in the rear of the
Washington School.
School Director Walsh asked the
Finance Committee to provide well
lighted rooms for the draughtsmen in
the City Architects office who are en
gaged in preparing plans for the new
school buildings. The committee
thought c-utside rooms should be rented
for the purposf, but postponed action.
The board allowed $1100 for the main
tenance of twenty-rive more beds in the
County Hospital. Dr. Ward said there
were 468 patients in the institution and
thirty on the waiting list. Ward Baid
there was a shortage of about $2800
left as a legacy from last year which
would have to be made up or the num
ber of patients would have to be re
duced. The Finance Committee decid
ed to look over Ihe salary roll of the
hospital before takinp any action.
The Board of Works was authorized
to expend $2400 for an oil plant in the

I'amily How in Court.
A family row in a boarding-house
kept by J. A. Thompson and his wife
t^rminat^d in a suit for damages in
Justice of the Peace Daniels' court
yestenlny afternoon. The Hannas
brought suit against the Thompsons
to recover $299 which they aver is duo
them for damages sustained for de
priving them of the use of their
apartments.
According to the testimony on both
sides, the house was the scene of fre
quent quarreling. All parties con
cerned admit this and seem proud of
the fact. The Hannas say the Thomp
sons locked them out of the apart
ments and therefore deprived them of
the privileges which they paid for in
advance. The case took up all of
Judge Daniels' afternoon, and" after
hearing all the testimony he decided
to take the case under advisement.
Then the warring clans filed out of
the courtroom. Mrs. Hanna and Mrs.
Thompson are sisters, but they looked
daggers at each other as they made
their escape.

Strasburg I'orfcits Bail.
I. R. Strasburg failed to appear in
Judge Lawlor's court yesterday and
the Judgr- declared his bail of $600
cash forfeited. A bench warrant was
issued for his arrest and his bonds
fixed at $3000. Strasburg and H. E.
"Whitehouse were awaiting trial on a
charge of obtaining $300 from Daniel
Mack on November 23 by falsely rep

Whitehouse was in court and the cases
were continued till to-morrow.

their husband's earnings on horse

they are furnished convenient facili

doubt that the men who provide these
housewives with money to meet house

to which it is put, and I think that it
is an excellent thing to give publicity
to every arrest of a woman for pool
buying."
Eric Larsen returned from a coast
ing voyage to find his home closed
and dark and his wife missing, and
after searching far and wide he dis
covered her among the defendants
awaiting trial in Judge Fritz's court,
the charge against her being that of
drunkenness. Twice did he attempt to
open verbal communication with her
and twice was he repulsed by a vigi
lant bailiff, and then in Swedish dia
lect he loudly proclaimed his inten
tion to burst in the door of his domi
cile if he were not permitted to ask
her for the key.
"I thought it was the woman you
wanted," said the bailiff apologet
ically, handing the doorkey to the en
raged spouse.
""Wo-man nit," was the heated re
ply. "Aye ban vant no wo-man
nef-er no more."
Then he departed, key in hand,
leaving his helpmate to her fate.
"Wait till I set out of here and I'll
fix you," is what Edward Hass, ac
cused of wife-beating, was reported to
have hissed at his spouse as she passed
him in Judge Conlan's courtroom.
When the Judge heard the report he
promptly raised Mr. Hass' bail to
$5000 and ordered that he be
charged with assault to murder, as he
had attacked the woman with a razor.

"MOTHER GOOSE" IS BEST
SHOW OF ITS KIND EXTANT
Great Spectacle for Children of All Ages
"Are You a Mason?"
/lakes Lauofiter
: (jL Afcazar,
It takes no prophet to foresee the fate
of "Mother Goose." that made its debut
here last evening at the Grand Opera
house. One can see the theater
swamped during the engagement by
conscienceful adults who have discov
ered it their duty to "take the chil
dren" â even if they have to borrow
'em. The circus was forgotten last
night, though one would rejoice in the
circus dictionary to describe the show.
Heroically that is what "Mother
Goose' is. a glittering, gloriaus, splen
diferous show, the best by miles of
anything of its kind ever seen "here. It
is Drnry Lane pantomime transplanted
to Third and Mission, and no home is
complete without it.
If there is a place jvhere another
nickel could have been spent upon the
production it does not show. Heading
the companyâ that cannot get on the
stage all at onee â is an excellent choir
of comedians. More of its 300 and odd
folk combine into a large and feather
rooted ballet. Another contingent
brings the big novelty of the) produc
tion in the aerial ballet, that sails
through the air as cheerfully as one
takes the car. These and the rest,
pretty, prettier and prettiest girls by
the score, are garbed in costumes of
an extravagant magnificence and
beauty that must be seen to be ap
preciated. The settings, too, are of
the utmost gorgeousness, stupendously,
tolossally, overwhelmingly â where is
that circus programme? â beautiful.
There is also an augmented orchestra
and a leader that has evidently led
before.
Nor is the management content with
this. They thrust upon you, further
much good music, real voices and
mints of fun, with people most hand
somely chosen to distribute it. Take
Joe Â«'awthorne. for example. Mr. Caw
thorne j s worth the price twice him
self. He has to interpret the strenuous
role of Mother Goose, who is contented
though Irish, and therefore obtains the
goose that lays the golden egg. Mr.
Cawthorne is of the sumptuously funny
folk. If he looks one way you laugh;
if he looks the other way you laugh,
too. You can't help it: neither can he.
Bui he is to be thanked for an enun
ciation that cuts to the gallery without
flaw, for a hard-working heel that does
smtif of the featheriest funny things
heels d<> and for a noble conscience.
His Mother Goose is one of the most
irresistibly comical figures that have
walked this way, whether he is spout
ing some of its gloriously silly puns,
sinKing "Social Eclat" or figuring in
the burlesque aerial ballet.
Harry Kelly again, who is what Fpr
riÂ« Hartman's baby is going to be like
some dayâ lf he stays at all like Ferris
â conies not at all far from Mr. Caw
thorne. He is the son of Mother Goose
In the piece and humorous no end. W.
H. Macart a-s a Scotch laird makes an
excellent third. With Clifton Crawford
thesf four worthies furnish a burleque
on Jhr military drama that is. hyster
ically funny. They conclude it with a
travesty on the barnyard quartets,
w ith thp "Old Oaken Bucket" as ma
terial, that is simply sinful.
Then there is Corinne as leading boy.
fitter and younger than ever and still
with the Iâ gs of the company. She
looms up in a most agreeably animated
fashion and â for pantomimeâ as a
graceful enough singer. Miss Neva Ay
mar as Miss Goose is a Dresden china
sort of person, and that way eminently
attractlve and pretty. Miss Aymar will
do well to limit her vocal ambitions to
the contralto scopeâ they are leading
her down, down, down among the
barytones. The other lady of the cast
is Edith St. Clair, also a taking and ef
fective person. As to the fairy queen.
Messrs. Klaw & Erlanger.with a Chi
nese faithfulness of imitation, have ob
tained the same kind of nice and not
too beautiful old lady that always does
the fairy queens at Drury Lane. One
could have stood an innovation here.
Walter Stanton does the Goose in most
accomplished way, and Dawe and Sey
mour furnish a hilarious horse.
The story moves through all kinds of
amusing specialties and brilliant
tableaux, the best of which closes the
second act. Here the stage is crowded
from end to end with lovely color and
form, and crowning it seven girls that
take flight into the air ancl there poise
COOL WEATHER
FOLLOWS STORM
Falling Temperatures Are
Reported From Southern
Portion of the State
LOS ANGELES, Feb. Â«.â The storm
which has hovered over Southern Cali
fornia for several days has passed and
has been followed by clear, cool weath
i er. Thje temperature to-night is the ]
I lowest of the winter and snould the
wind abate frost may fall in the low
lands. The mountains back of Pasa
dena are covered with snow, the result
of last night's precipitation, which in !
this city amounted to about an inch of |
rain.
Railroads have repaired the breaks
! caused by washouts and to-night it is
announced by both the Santa Fe and j
the Southern Pacific that many delayed I
trains will reach here to-morrow. The ]
Southern Pacific brought in several
long overdue trains to-day.
The total rainfall to date is 10.89
inches, compared with 1.63 at this time
last year.
SAN DIEGO. Feb. 6.â Rain continues
to fall in showers. Last night .40 of an
inch was added to the fall, accom
panied by high wind. This morning a
heavy shower continued for two hours.
For the storm the figures are 4.23; for
the season, 9.02, an excess of 3.21 over
the hfty-year normal. All the big
reservoirs in the county are being fill
ed. The San Diego River is 200 feet
wide and four feet deep. The Tia
Juana River is 400 feet wide and five
feet deep. The rainfall in the moun
tains has been heavier than in this
city.
A unique feature of the present
storm in Southern California is a heavy
fall of snow, which has succeeded the
rain in the mountain regions. Several
of the ranges are covered by a white
mantle. Reports from Cuyamaca state
that the snow is nine inches deep.
like the seagulls round the ferry- Even
this does nut end the surprise. One of
them comes forward to the footlights,
darts upward over the audience clear
to the gallery, scattering: flowers by thÂ»
way. It is an altogether charming il
lusion. There is, in short, every reason
not to miss "Mother Goose."
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
Alcazar.
There are many laughs coming to
those who see Harry Hilliard at the
Aicazar this week in "Are you a Ma
son?" The stock company opened
with the play last evening. Hilliard
in his female impersonation was eas
ily the applause winner of the array.
At the end of the second act there
were as many curtain calls as Tetraz
zini gets after the mad scene in "Lu
cia" at the Tivoll and Hilliard was the
particular target at which most of the
plaudits were aimed. He was not Urn
entire show but was a large part of
it. The people who talk about the
play to-day will say more about him
than about all the others combined.
But Craig was brisk and not too fond
of horse play in the role of Percy.
Maher was funny as Bloodgood.
Conness as Halton was not bad. The
situations kept the audience in a
laughing mood most of the time. The
men in the cast> made more of their
chances than the women.
The demand for "Old Heidelberg"
is so insistent that it will Be revived
next Monday upon the same scale as
before and with the same cast. It
is the greatest artistic success in the
Alcazar's history. "The Middleman"
is postponed.
Central.
"A Fight for Millions" scored a great
success at the Central Theater last
night. The drama is full of sensa
tional incidents and the mechanical
effects are far above the ordinary, in
cluding a full-sized submarine boat, a
set of wireless telegraph instruments
and a locomotive. A genuine ovation
greeted Myrtle Vane, the popular sou
brette, on her reappearance after her
illness. She played her pare with her
unual vim. Juliet Crosby, as a true
hearted American girl, had a good op
portunity to display her versatility
and she was most acceptable. She
was. as usual, charmingly gowned.
Herschell Mayall played the part of a
persecuted Inventor who triumphs in
