LONDON, May 23. â It is learned
that the gravity of the Tibetan situa
tion is spoiling the Cabinet's enjoy
ment of its "Whitsuntide holiday. It
is believed by those in closest touch
with the condition of affairs in Tibet
that Colonel Younghusband will be
forced to retire from his position near
Gyangtse soon. > This, it is pointed
out, will prove a blow to British pres
tige in Tibet, for It is possible that
such retirement will arouse the fron
tier tribes and force the campaign for
a conquest of the whole Hlmalyan
hinterland. The task would prove an
incalculably . difficult one. Viceroy
Curzon is now blamed for supposing
that the Tibetans were a spiritless na
tion. It is evident that they have the
fighting spirit common to all moun
taineers.

ENGLISH CABINET WORRIES
OVER TIBETAN* SITUATION*
The disastrous floods which occunwd during:
the winter Just passed have called attention
In an emphatic degree to the . Importance : of
tti* river system* of the StaU of Calif.ornia,
The platform adopted is in part a
plan for the education of the public,
but it also outlines a scheme of prelim
inary work for river improvements of
the widest scope. In accordance with
Its provisions the convention will to
day appoint a committee of twenty
flve empowered to establish a commis
sion of: engineers. It will be the duty
o^ this commission to submit to, the
next Legislature", a plan for such per
manent changes In the drainage sys
tem of the great valleys as will pre
vent the damaging floods that are now
destroying so much of the. State's
Here is the platform in full:
,. . Half a thousand solid men of busi
ness, industry, science and commerce,
representing all parts of the great Sac
ramento and San Joaquin valleys, met
yesterday in the Maple room at the
Palace Hotel and organized a move
ment of the first importance to the
vast interior of California, and of hard
ly less moment to the entire State. It
was the first session of the "River
Convention." called by the commercial
bodies of Sacramento, Stockton, -Fresno
and other interior cities, in connection
with the California Promotion Commit
tee and leading San Francisco organi
zations. No recent gathering in this
city has stood for interests so vast or
debated so ably questions of such wide
reaching import.
The fact that 750,000 acres of rich
lands in the valleys are under water
from the freshets of the spring, that
nearly 100,000 acres of actual farms, the
finest in California, have been buried
beneath the floods by the breaks in the
Sacramento levees, and that the dam
age to the agricultural interests of the
State already is estimated at more
than $5,000,000, constituted the imme
diate cause of the convention. Its aim
was Jo discuss ways and means to meet
this situation, not by temporary make
shifts, effective for. this year or a few
years, but by a comprehensive plan of
river improvement that will, for good
and all, open ample outlet for the
mountain floods, reclaim the vast areas
now annually inundated and secure
against future deluge all these rich
deltas. The convention is largely edu
cational, and the keynote of all its de
liberations is the need of organizing
public sentiment throughout the State
to back so great an undertaking.
With this end in view, the platform
adopted last evening on report of the
committee on resolutions embraces the
most vital work of the gathering. But
the papers read, the informal speeches
delivered and the debates keenly fought
out were all noteworthy.

pleasure that the Government sÂ«ms of late to
have adopted a more liberal policy, and In
many caccs has made provision for the per
formance of work that will benefit a large
numbfr of people where the work could not
have been done. by private enterprise.

has now arrived In California when the sub
ject should receive our earnest attention and
any plan adopted our united support.
We suggest that any plan that Is adopted

honorable means to secure the adoption and
execution of such plans when adopted.
Inasmuch as the work to be performed by

Mr. Jennings, on taking the chair,
said:

Captain Bonsor of the Hazelton got
wrathy at this, and suddenly his vessel
plunged bow foremost into the broad
side of the Mount Royal. Another foot
and thÂ° Litters engine-room would
have been flooded, so that she would
have sunk. Cartain Wood accused
Bon.Â«-or of purposely colliding with his
vessel. Bonsor called Wood a liar and
added many similar epithets. Each
man then sent for his revolver, and the
paFsensÂ»rs sought the engine-rooms for
shelter. Accounts differ regarding the
number of bullets that were passed,
but no actual damage was done. Final
ly both men gave up the bombardment
as the HazÂ»lton got under way. The
Mount Royal is badly damaged. Her
ownera are making complaint to the

VANCOUVER, B. C, May 23.âPas
sengers arriving by the steamer Co
quielam from Port Essington to-day
tell of an exciting gun fight which took
place last Friday between rival steam
boat captains on the Skeena River. It
was the first trip of the season for the
two boats, the Mount Royal and the
Hazelton, which ply on that stream.
Many bets were made as to which
would reach the upper river first. The
Hazelton, Captain Bonsor, had the ad
vantage at the start and several times
jockeyed the other vessel pretty nearly
to the bank. But by a bit of luck the
Mount Royal turned the tables on her
rival and was soon zigzagging the
course! trying to keep the Hazelton
bt hind.

Admiral Bowles continued:
"I believe that it is worth while to
have a merchant marine, and the
cheapest and most direct way to get
It would be for the Government to step
in and equalize the cost of building
ships; and then It should pay a bouity
to th<Â» shipowners for the additional
cost of running the ships under Ameri
can laws. This should operate for a
fixed period, 6O that capital might be
invited in."
Representative McDermott asked if
it is not a fact that the price of steel
rails r.as absolutely maintained by the
Bteel pool, and the admiral replied:
"I believe it is so."
"On July 1 of last year," he continued,
*'I made a list of the battleships and
armored cruisers building in this
country and England. To my sur
prise I found that the cost was the
same here as in England. Why? If
the American builder bid in a business
way this would be impossible. But
there has been cut-throat competition
to get the contracts for battleships.
There Is not a battleship building at a
price which the builder can afford."
Rear Admiral Bowles, president of
the Fore River Shipbuilding Company
of Quincy, Mass., said that the only
advantage we had over Knglish and
Scotch builders was in wood, very little
of which was u^ed in cargo carriers.
Steel plates here were 50 per cent
higher. The wages here exceeded those
in English yards by from 30 to 60 per
cent.
Nixon paid that foreign countries paid
526.0OO.C00 in bounties. He was in favor
cf differential duiies.
WARSHIPS BUILT AT LOSS.
"You would have to take the tariff
off everything, because everything
goes into a ship. If we had free ma
terial and free ships we should have
to have free labor, too, because you
recognize that labor is protected as
well."
C B. Orcutt, president of the New
port News Shipbuilding Company, told
the commission that ships could be
built in Ungliuid for 75 per cent less
than they can be built for here. The
cause of this difference, he asserted,
Â¦was that 75 per cent more was paid for
labor in the yards of this country
than in Great Britain and at the some
time there was 40 per cent in the cost
<if material in favor of the English
builders. He said the protective tariff
was responsible for the difference in
cost of material. In a later statement,
however, be corrected his estimates to
from 40 to 50 per cent.
Lewis Nixon said builders in this
country had been constructing too
pood ships for American use. There
vas no demand for the English tramp
type of vessel in this country. He said
the cost of the building here was
greater than lu England.
â¢Suppose you should take the duty
off :.!! ship-building materials, do you
think that would be of benefit?" asked
Senator Lodge.
HIGH' WAGES FOR LABOR.
Thomas Clyde of the Clyde Line,
the first witness called, strongly advo
cated a ship subsidy. After a deep
study of the problem he was con
vinced that this was the best course
to pursue. He presented a chart show
ing the status of the chief mari
time net ior.s of the world. The United
States stands at the bottom. All of
the nations, he said, had given aid of
some sort to natural conditions. Clyde
said the United States must pay the
builders the difference in cost of build
ing arid also enough to enable them to
operate the ships, on account of the
much higher rate paid sailors under
the American flag.
NEW YORK. May 23.â ThÂ« Merchant
Marine Commission, authorized by the
injty-elghth Congress to consider and
recommend legislation for the develop
ment of the American merchant ma
rine, began its first session here to
day. Senator Gallingrer of New Hamp
shire Is chairman of thÂ« commission,
Â¦which is coir posed of members of
both branches of Congress.
Senator Gallinger, In opening the In
quiry, pointed out that more than 90
per cent of the foreign commerce of
this country was being carried in for
rign chips and paid that the commis
sion would be fortunate if the decision
here and elsewhere sheds as much
light on the subject as would enable
It to recommend to Congress legislation
of a remedial character.
"A sympathetic strike will be adopted
only as a last resort. -If the railroad
company wants a fight we will give it.
for with the men we can call out we
can tie up all the freight transporta
tion In New York and stop the move
ment of food supplies, raw material
and poods of every sort. But we do
not want to do that if it can be
helped."
At a. meeting of representatives of
the teamsters' and freight handlers'
unions late to-night it was decided that
unless the officials of the New York.
New Haven and Hartford system con
sent to meet a committee from tho
strikers early to-morrow the tearastera
will go out in sympathy with the
freight handlers.
The freight clerks and the marine
firemen were also represented at tha
meeting to-day. About thirty delegates
acted for 58,000 employes. President
Curran says that the delegates from
the other unions pledged their support
to him for a sympathetic strike at the
moment he should ask for it. He con
tinued:
NEW YORK, May 23.â Because of a
strike of firemen and oilers on the
transfer boats of the New York. New
Haven and Hartford lines. President
Roosevelt. Mrs. Roosevelt and Secre
tary Loeb were obliged to-night to
take a cross-country route and suffer
considerable delay and inconvenience
in going from Washington to Groton.
Mass.. where the President's sons are
attending school.
The President's car left Washington
at 5 o'clock, over the Pennsylvania
road, and the party was to have come
direct to Jersey City, transfer there to
one of the New Haven boats and con
tinue the journey over the New York.
New Haven and Hartford Railway.
Whether the Pennsylvania Company
disliked to subject the President to pos
sible delays under present conditions
or feared something more serious
might occur to retard him, it changed
the route. and at Trenton hi3 car was
switched' off the main line and sent
over the Belvidere division. At Belvi
dere it was again switched to the Dela
ware and Hudson tracks, and at May
brook. N. Y., it was again transferred
to the New England road and wen*
over the Pgughkeepsle bridge.
Officials of the company would give
no. reason as ,to why the President's
route was changed. It was rumored
early in the evening 1 that the company
had been informed by strikers that the
boat would not be permitted to make
the trip and that it would be better
wisdom to take the President by some
other route.

form and resolutions was then pre
sented by Senator Robert T. Devlin, in
the form printed above, and at once
became the subject of a debate that
occupied the rest of the evening. Thi3
debate was, started by General "Will S.
Green's motion to strike out the section
requiring, the employment of three en
gineers from outside the State. Green
wanted the selection of the experts to
form the commission, left wholly to the
committee to be appointed by the con
vention. He was ably supported by a
number of speakers, but/ the voiqes
raised in favor of the report as it
stood were in the majority. Among
those lining up behind Green were
Russell L. Dunn. J. "W. Snowball,
Charles Cauvillaud and W. A. Beard.
Opposed to the amendment were
John W. Ferris, Colonel E. A. Forbes.
Frank D. Ryan, P. J. Van Loben Sels,
Lee A; Phillips, Robert T. Devlin and
G. W. â¢ McNoble. These speakers em
phasized the impossibility of carrying
out the vast drainage scheme upon
which all engineers are practically
agreed unless an appropriation from
Congress can be obtained. Hence, they
argued,, i\ was desirable that. the plans
for the work should be prepared and
presented to Congress by men of na
tional or international fame, free from
the suspicion of local interest.
This view finally prevailed, and
Green's amendment was voted down
by "a big majority. The only altera
tion made in the report was adopted
on motion of A. J. Park of Hanford, in
creafcing the standing committee from
twenty-three, to twenty-flve, in Order
to give the upper San Joaquin Valley
two representatives.
The convention adjourned until 10
o'clock this morning, when the several
district delegations, will report their
nominees for this standing committee.
Other business wiN alao be transacted.
The evening session was opened with
a paper by J. W. Kaerth of Colusa on
the subject of the flood waters of the
Sacramento and their possible control.
In order to make his address more
clear, a map showinj? the present
course of the flow of wUer and the
overflow; was hunjr on the wall and at
frequent intervals Mr. Kaerth pointed
to the map to emphasize his remarks.
His contention was that levees did
little or no good, deposits of nature
offsetting such artificial work. '
L. A. Phillips of Stockton did not
have a paper because no particular
question had been assigned to him.
He took up the matter of values of
reclaimed lands. He thought the
values were high, but the southern
lands are inferior to the lands in the
delta region of this portion of the
State. In the future, and within a
few years, he expects $300 an acre
will be a reasonable price. United ef
fort on the part of all, people is the
keynote of success in matters of re
clamation, but present conditions are
a drawback to the settlement of the
lands, he said.
INTERESTING DEBATE.

The convention then took a recess

EVENING SESSION.
TRENTON, N. J.. May 23.âArgu
ments were concluded before Judge
Bradford in the United States Circuit
Court to-day in the case of the appli
cation of E. EL Harriman and Winslow
F. Pierce to restrain the proposed plan
of distribution of the. assets of the
Northern Securities Company, â¢ which
was decided by the United States Su
preme Court to be an illegal combina
tion. The concluding argument for the
Northern Securities Company was
made by John G. Johnson of Philadel
phia and W. D. Guthrie of New York
closed the argunv.-ct on behalf of the
complainant.*
The argument on both Bides turned
largely on the question as to the title
t> tho Northern Pacific stock which
Harriman and Pierce put into the
combination and which amounted to
â¢about J7&,000,000. The main contention
of Johnson was that the stock had bo
comt the absolute property of the
Northern Securities Company and that
it was perfectly legal for the Northern
Securities Company to carry out the
pro rata plan cf distribution upon
which the company had agreed.
Guthrie's principal point was that
because ot the illegal combination title
to .the Northern Pacific stock had not
l:.iFi-ed from Harriman and Pierce and
that in consequence they were entitled
to have returned to them the particu
lar stock they put into the combination
and which Involved the control of the
Northern Pacific Company.

J. B. Lippincott of the United States

the results of the survey In the Sac

p.rro 'arid, of ' the good work accom-
WHAT UNCLE SAM IS DOING.
United States Senator Bard, who was
unable to- be present, sent a letter ex
pressing his interest in the meeting,
which follows in part:
The whole people of our State recognize the
great importance of providing a remeUy for
the repeated disastrous flooding of rich and
productive regions lying in the valleys of the
Sacramento and San Joaauin rivers, and the
united action by the representatives of the ag
ricultural, commercial and other interests di
rectly affected will undoubtedly receive the
co--n*ratlon. sympathy and support of other
sections of the State. As representing in part
the State of California in the betiate of the
United States, it will be my pleasure as my
duty to support any reasonable and needed
legislation having in view the aid of the
general Government to Â»ecure protection in the
future against the floods. , ; ; 'ii
The subject will \r well discussed at the
cenventlon and some practical scheme will be
devised for Improving the conditions of the
rivers, and It U almoet unnecessary to nay
that the results of the discussion of the sub
ject by the able EtatoFmen, engineers and
business men in the convention will command
the eervlceÂ» of all of the , Congressional dele
gation.
SBARBORO OS CO-OPERATION.'
Andrea Sbarboro, president of the
California Promotion Committee,
epoke as follows on the necessity of
unity and co-operation in saving the"
flooded districts:
Here we must have the co-operation of the
land ' owners whose land Is almost worthless
without the assurance of its being protected
from winter floods. We. must alao have the
co-operation of the land owner whose land may
already be rÂ»rotected but will l>e enhanced In
value by ' the Improvement of the land of his
les* fortunate neighbor.
The farBrers residing In the vicinity of the
proposed Improvement - are now living in con
tinuous anxiety. Even If they have a fortu
nate year they will fret for what may happen
to them in the year to come. This great im
provement will set their minds at rest. 1 They
will lay plans for the permanent Improving
and beautifying of their homes, their towns
and their cities. Knowing that the dreaded
floods will disturb them no more.
The towns and cities throughout the breadth
and length of California must lend, through
their representatives In the City Councils, In
the Legislature and in Congress, their helping
hand. The Improvement of one part yof Cali
fornia U tbÂ« benefit of the whole State. The
southern part of the State must help this
movement, as the northern part of the State
must help all Improvement* which may be
contemplated In tho aouthern part of Califor
nia.
San Francisco must above all cltieÂ« give
thin great undertaking Its most energetic sup
port. - Every bean, every peach, every pear,
every grain of wheat and every bunch of
grapes that this great work will add to the
products of the State will be a benefit to San
Francisco and all parts of California. When
the thousands of acres of land of the rich
Sacramento Valley will be placed permanently
under cultivation there will be required thous
ands of tillers of tbe soil to Increase Its pro
ductions. Here the work of the California
Promotion Committee will be a powerful aid
to bring to this State - a good claps of "Â»raia
nent farmer* to enrich the State. There Is
no danger of overcrowding. Here we . have
room for many millions of people to benefit
themselves and to benefit those who are al
ready here.
BARD SENDS LETTER.
Till: oACRAMEXTO RAINFALL.
Professor McAdie read a paper/on
"The Rainfall and Floods in the Sac
ramento Valley." He said:
So large aA'oluiae of water has not fallen
In the Kacraniento Valley for many years as
during the rainy season just past. At many
points the water was higher than In 18Â»J2, al
though thÂ» record* showed that In January,
lt>C2. the rainfall exceeded the combined pre
cipitation of February and March, l'J04.
Judging from the experience of the ]>ast, one
might safely estimate the probability of thirty
inches of rain in ninety days over the water
shed ot the Sacramento, which, north of the
city of Sacramento, hug an area of
square mile*. This would give a tc-tai of
l.SJi.H-O.OOO.COO cubic feet of water. This
fftimate is l>a*ed. however, upon ralnfalt in
the valley proper, while it If well known that
the rainfcll in the foothills is considerably
lancer and may even amount, at an elevation
of 2000 fret, to twice that recorded at eleva
tion* of about 10O feet above the sea level.
At many points* in the valley the rainfall
was more than doubl<Â» a normal rainfall, and
at some p^lntiS one and a half Urn** as much.
How treat tMs excess was in actual rainfall
is ehown by the following table, giving the
amounts above normal for the sixty -days under
consideration : At Auburn, 15.1S inches, l.'O
per crnt excess; at Coif ax. 28.08 inches, 100
per cent txcess; at Dunsmulr. .'U.01 Inches,
2(^0 per cent excess ; at Summerdale. 18.38
lncheK. or 100 per cent excess, and at Summit,
â¢MAX inch's, 250 iÂ«>r cent exc.-ss.
From all or the above it appears that the
iprei-ent Sacramento River syMem. is inade
quate to meet a rainfall of double the normal
amount and extending over a period of thirty
days or more. Of course, the time distribution
of the rain is onÂ« of tho moat Important factors
In determining flood iÂ»riodi<. An.l on the other
hand it is plahi that a continuation of the ex
cesÂ«Iveiy heavy rain* of the lÂ«th of February,
on the 17th and 18th, would have rceulted In
greater team, and the same statement iÂ» true
Concerning the period following-JUarch 10 and
Merch 27. Gri.at as the losses- have been, it Is
indifputable that A continuation of the rain
on Marth 2Â«.'and an extension of the rain a r? a
a little southward into the watershed of the
Lower San Joaquin would have resulted In
an overflow of the entire section under con
eideralSon.
At the conclusion of the address the
chair appointed as committee of per
manent organization and order of
business Arthur R Briggs of San
Francisco, Lee A. Phillips of^ Stockton,
Robert T. Devlin of Sacramento, and
P. J. Van Loben Sels and John W.
Ferris of San Francisco. The commit
tee on credentials appointed was H. I.
Seymour, W. S. Green of Colusa and
Professor A. G. McAdie of the Weather
Bureau.
I wish to emphasize the obvious trust that
San Fraadsco will grow 'great as fast as its
back country grcwÂ» in population and wealth.
We shall benefit, fcr example, by the Panama
canal in almost exactly the "game proportions
â¢oÂ» the Fan Joaquin and Sacramento valleys
benefit thereby. In this the city and country
Â¦will prosper together. If the farmer of the
valley gelt, his products to- market cheaper
he has the extra profit to buy other goods with.
BT.d San Frar.c-isco is his shopkeeper. If the
rivÂ«?r valle>s can be made to support more
people anJ to raise more produce, that produce
will pars through the hands of the city mer
chants. Tha city Is the servant of its country,
and each benefits by the Interchange of goods
and cervices. When the rivrr lands now de
vastated every year by floods teem with an
Industrious population, then will San Francisco
Men Into her heritage. -
land has not been and probably will not be
entirely successful.
W e in California are not alor.e subjected to
these dangers. It has been the fate of the
human race from timÂ« almost immemorial to
be subjected to the dangers of overflow* from
rivers in times of flood?. As you will remem
ber the MlE?issipDl Klver has been taken hold
of by the hand of man and reduced to prac
tical subjection. The Sacramento and San
Joaquin present no prcblem which cannot
properly be controlled when the proper effort
is made. It is a: simple problem to put to
work upon the river that knowledge and force
to reduce ; the Sacramento and San Joaquin
rrvers to. subjection 1 .hope Bincerely that
the convention will fÂ«2 to it that this is
carried out, that -the~s81fUh interest of any
man or body of men will not be allowed to
interfere with the '.'onward march of this move
ment, and that irken the convention adjourns
it will have the matter left In the hands of
men in whom we have confidence and in
whose integrity we have every faith.
I ha\> no doubt the whole people of this
State will meet you more than half way and
will extend to you from the extreme southern
to thÂ« extreme northern section of the State
the right hand cf friendship and will be glad
and pleased to eee you succeed In this enter
prise. We are all Interested In It and as the
representative Of the whole people In the State
I am here to-day to nay to you that we bid

RIVERS AS XATIOX BUILDERS.
Professor Carl C. Plehn of the Uni
versity of California read an interest
ing paper on "The Importance of Riv
ers to the Country."' He discussed the
part played by rivers in the develop
ment of the commerce and agriculture
of the great nations of the world, the
building of important cities and the
promotion of progress and civilization.
In closing he said:
The convention then listened ' Â¦ with
interest to a paper on "Plan of Relief,"
read by Frank ;D: Ryan, Commissioner
of Public Works at- Sacramento.-. Ryan
argued forcibly. for a by-canal to re-
FOn A BY-CAXAL.
Chairman Jennings announced the
appointment of the following commit
tee on platform and resolutions: Rob
ert T. Jennings, P. J. Van Loben Sels
and John W. Ferris, representing the
Sacramento district; Lee A. Phillips,"
R. E. Wilhoit and Samuel ( Franken
heim, the San Joaquin district; Frank
J. Symmes, General NI P. Chipmanand
R. M. Welch, San Francisco, ; and
Colonel E. A. Forbes, Marysville.
State Senator Robert T. Devlin of
Sacramento read a noteworthy paper
on "The Practicability, of a District
Drainage Law." He argued for the
creation of a single drainage district
to include all the areas affected by the
floods. After quoting decisions of the
Supreme Court to show that such a
statute would be constitutttonal, he
discussed some of the things It should
contain.
WOULD MAKE ONE DISTRICT.
Third â We recommend that a committee of
nine on platform and resolutions be appointed
by the chair, three from tho Sacramento Val
ley, three from the San Joaquin Valley and
three from San Francisco and vicinity. ,
Second â We recommend the following as vice
presidents: General N T . P. Chlpman, San
Francisco; George \V. McNoble, Stockton; Al
den Anderson of Suisun;' Charles, W. Thomas,
Woodland; C. LÂ». Donohoe, ' Willows, and Gen
eral W. T. Sheehan, Sacramento.
J. W. Snowball of Knights Landing,
Yolo County, told of the Indian tradi
tion when he came to California in '49
that in the old days* a fresh water lake
covered the whole of the interior and
that a great earthquake resulted in
the formation of the Golden Gate and
the release of these inland, waters to
the pea. -The problem before the .peo
ple <j( California is to. continue the
work of the earthquake by increasing
the outlets to the . sea. This, could
never be accomplished "tinder the pres^
system of more than 700 reclama
tion districts, but it must be .brought
about by putting the subject' In the
hands of a responsible' and . central
body.
The report of the committee on per
manent organization, presented by its
chairman, A. R. Briggs, and adopted
unanimously, was as follows:
Your committee on .permanent organization
and order of business begs to report: Â£
First â We recommend that the temporary of
ficers be made the permanent officers of this
convention. .. -
WHEN VALLEY WAS A LAKE.
"Any plan that proposes the relief of
the floods of one river by increasing
those of the other will not meet our
needs," declared the speaker. "The Cal
ifornia State Board of Trade is work
ing to promote the symmetrical devel
opment of the State, and we hope that
every acre of land on the Sacramento
may be reclaimed without imperiling
an acre on the lower feaches of the
San Joaquin." (Applause.)
. A. G. Park of Hanford, representing
the San Joaquin Valley' Commercial
Association, reported on the destruction
of 15,000 acres of fine grain by the re
cent flood. He pleaded for aid from
the entire State, and raised a laugh by
saying, "We look to San Francisco for
our commerce, to Los Angeles for our
religion and to the Commonwealth Club
of California for our salvation. San
Francisco comes down and makes love
to us. Los Angeles comes up and
makes love to us. We are like the Lady
of the Lake, but we want the love of
each section and the help of the entire
State in obtaining protection from the
Tulare overflow."
At the afternoon session General Will
S. Green of Colusa grave some reminis
cences of boating on the Sacramento
River in the early '50's. The river then
had no bars or shoals, and an ocean
going steamer could go from San Fran
cisco to Sacramento without. an hour'3
delay.
General Green was followed by
Colonel John P. Irish, who spoke in
place of W. H. Mills, who was pre
vented by' .-illness-; from, being â¢ssent.
Colonel Irish told the convex i that
the California State Board vl Trade
was deeply interested in the movement
to control the great rivers. For years
it had been calling attention of Eastern
people to the lands in the California
deltas as the richest of all delta soils
in the world. Statistics of rainfall for
the San Joaquin, similar to those al
ready compiled for the Sacramento,
were greatly needed in order to aid in
solving the problem of river control.
This problem was made more difficult
by its dual character and the different
conditions obtaining in the two river
areas.

SHIPS AT SACRAMENTO.
The important announcement was
made by Mr. Lippincott that in in
vestigating the river question in this
State the services of the engineering
corps connected with the geological
survey could be secured in aid of the
engineers that may be employed in
this State. These Government engi
neers are engaged in Government
work along- the Colorado River, in
Nevada, and at all points where the
national irrigation work is in progress
west of the Rocky Mountains. JJ'his
statement was greeted with applause,
as was also one to the effect that the
sum of ?3,000,000 hns just been set
aside by the Government to care for
the lands on the California side of
the Colorado River.
The committee on credentials next
reported. The delegates at large were
Governor George C. Pardee, William
J. Wynn, J. C. Xeedham, J. B. Lip
pincott. Mr. Elliott of the Department
of Agriculture and Carl C. Plehn.
The representation of different bodies
and subdivisions of the State were
numerically reported as follows:
plished by it in securing State co
operation with the Government. ' The
Geological Survey, reported Mr. Lip
pincott, had carried on work along the
lines of topography and hydrography.
A topographic map had been prepared
on a scale of two inches to the mile,
covering the country, from Iron
Canyon, above Red Bluff, to the bay
of San Francisco. This map could be
used as the basis of study in the en
gineering problems concerning over
flow rtnd reclamation. The geological
survey had made a study of drainage
areas, reservoir sites, etc., from
Putah Creek, .around the headwaters
of the Sacramento River, and cover
ing the country as far north as Pitt
River. Reservoir sites had been dis
covered that would, provide for the
covering of 1,800,000 acres with water
a foot deep. A way was thus provided
to stop the peak of the flood wave.
The great water preserver and the
great flood preventive were the for
ests, which store the water. The most
important thing for the Sacramento
River was the preservation of the for
ests on tho watershed.
G. "W. McNoble - and F. E. Dunlap,
both of Stockton and the latter a
member of the State "Assembly, spoke
of tho distinctive Interests of the San
Joaquin Valley in the plans for con
trolling the floods. They demanded, a
board of engineers that would afford
their district competent representa
tion and that would also include in
its membership experts from the val
ley of the Mississippi, familiar with
the problems met and conquered in
the control of that river near the Gulf
Tirey L. Ford, speaking as a repre
sentative of the Miners' Association,
addressed the convention briefly, de
claring that the rivers would never be
subjected to man's dominion by any
piecemeal work. Engineers were
agreed, he said, that every foot of the
land in the valleys could be reclaimed,
but in order to accomplish this it was
necessary to unite the services of en
gineers, legislators and lawyers in
working out a practicable plan . with
the attendant legislation.
"When we have solved this great
problem.", said Ford, "instead of a
population of 1,500,000 in the* whole
State/the two valleys will support 20.
000,000, for they have the richest soil
in the world." ' \''^~
Duncan E. Â¦ McKinlay, Assistant
United States District Attorney, was
introduced and made a brief address
demanding the support of the moun
tain and coast sections of th'e State for
the effort to save the valley lands. The
convention, he said, should bring home
to the legislators of all sections the
need of prompt action to stop the rav
apes of the iloods.
H. M. La Rue of Sacramento, the for
mer Railroad Commissioner, told of his
experiences with the floods which had
destroyed the value' of his own lands
four miles above the capital, city, and
argued earnestly for a cut through
the Montezuma Hills as the only way
in which an outlet for (he surplus
waters of the Sacramento could be
found.' "This^might cost $5,000,000" or
more, but it would save 750,000 acres of
land and more than double their value.
Only by such radical measure could
the valley farmers be rescued. La Rue
recalled pioneer days when the river
had banks twenty feet hlgn at low
water and a fourteen-inch tide at Sac
ramento. The great floods of the six
ties, he said, brought down vast de
posits of sediment and filled the chan
nel.
MANY OTHERS SPEAK.
The work on the west Hide of the river
demar.dK $3,412,000. Onr-thlrd of this work
1 propose fhall be borne by the district af
fected and the land wouM have to be bonded
to ra).Â«B the money. The bonds would be
unsalable In the open market and to mak*
them salable I propose that the State should
be ayked to guarantee the interest on them,
if it Can be legally done. I submit that it
would be good business on the part of the
Btate to do this; not only would this work
be a part of the work necessary to prevent
a repetition of thl* year's disaster, but it is
to be the meani lc the first Instance of re
claiming 17. r >,000 acres of land paying nothing
or next to nothing for taxes and. Is the mearu
by which alone the vast territory lylnz to
thi> north and farther ' up the river can be
reclaimed. .
One-thinl the cost of the work Included in
the necessary improvements telow Sacramento
I propose Blinll he borne by the land oast of
the Sacramento River. The assessed valuation
of this district In about $17,000,000 and the
cost to the landowners would be 1 per cent
on this valuation, or assuming the average
assessed value of the reclaimed swamp land
to bÂ« $30 an acre, the tax upon it would be
about 15 cents per acre for each of the two
years that the #vork would probably take.
I propose that the land to be benefited by
the proposed work shall be included in , one
or more drainage districts. At first sight It
would perhaps appear that one general drain
age district could handle the questions in
volved, but if you will consider for a. mo
ment you will see that the DOlnt of view of
owners of land already, reclaimed will not be
identical with -that of the owners of unre
claimed lands; at all events there la danger
that the reclaimed lands will perhapa fear
that, they are go'ing to be taxed to reclaim
other lands.
The exact share of the cost to be borne by
each of the three parties to the undertaking is
not easy to determine oS haad; but it has been
thought by men who have considered the mat
ter that an equal division of the cost of the
work between the . Federal Government, the
State government and the land owners would
be just and fair.
There are, as It appears to me, three distinct
interests Involved In this workâ the Federal
Government, which guards Jealously the right
to control , the navigability of the rivers; Qie
State government, whose duty It Is to render
possible the reclamation of the lands the State
has sold to individuals, and the land owner,
who will doubtleas be willing to till in the
detail of reclamation work when the State
and Federal governments dispose of such bold
and general features as are at once essential
to development and beyond the power of Indi
viduals. â¢
On the map of the Tolo Basin I show a loca
tion of a proposed bye pass canal which may
cr may .not be approved. I would place at and
above Elkhorn the weirs or possibly the head
gates that should control the flood plane.
As Commissioner of Public Works my limit
should perhaps be reached when the design
of this work Is suggested, but I am going to lay
before you my idea of the way the money
can be raisedyto do the work. I think It is
but little use ttshope that the funds. for this
work,-, amounting to somewhere about 54,000,
000, Is going to be appropriated by the State
Legislature.

the testimonial of a woman who had
been cured of similar trouble through
the use of Lydia E. Pinkham's

The robber bands have grown bold
rr and more active than ever. Within
a few weeks of the date of -^.he letter
to the Frankfurter Zeitung a band
numbering as many as 2000 men at
tacked a well-guarded railway station.
The Russians asserted thaj they posi
tively recognized Japanese officers in
command of the assailants.
Continuing, the correspondent asserts
that ferocious bitterness prevails
throughout the Chinese population
against the Russians. He then related
the following incidents in explanation
thereof: After saying that the Russian
settlers regarded the natives as being
far lower than dogs, the correspondent
says Russian officers assured him- that
tho peasant settlers tested their new
rifles by taking a native as a target.
"One engineer with whom I trav
eled," he asserts, "did not salute a
wtll-known officer because the latter
had shot down eight of the engineer's
best laborers in mere wantonness. His
complaint remained unanswered."
In consequence of such conditions,
the correspondent asserts in conclu
sion, the entire laboring population
are longing for the moment when they
may dare to fall upon their torment
ors.

By similar means the robber bands
are well supplied with the m >st mod
ern rifles and plenty of ammunition.

BERLIN. Mav 23. â A correspondent
of the Frankfurter Zeitung, writing
from Harbin under date of April 15,
gives striking details illustrative of the
conditions of the Russian army and
the relations existing between the Rus
sians and Chinese. He says that two
officers. Colonel Korlinsky and Staff
Captain Ignotowich, are in the Harbin
Prison awaiting the carrying out of
sentences of death imposed upon them
for selling large supplies of gunpowder
to the Chinese from the army depots.
The pflicers charged the Chinese $25
per 36 pounds, but, their supplies run
ning low, they filled the boxes with
rand and placed a layer of gunpowder
or. top. At the same time they raised
the Drlce to $50. The Chinese mer
chants, incensed at the. swindle, caused
the matter to be made known in high
er quarters and a watch was set, re
sulting in the detection of the officers
in the act of selling gunpowder to Rus
sian intermediaries.

OMAHA, Neb., May 23.â Horace G.
Burt, former president of the" Union
Pacific Railroad, who has been travel-
Ing in the Orient, has written a friend
in this city that he was followed by
Japanese detectives until it became so
irksome that he was forced to appeal
to a United States Consul for relief.
Shortly after his arrival in Japan the
newspapers all over the empire pub
lished an article to the effect that Burt
was about to be placed In control of
the Trans-Siberian Railway. He was
at once placed under espionage and de
tectives followed him from place to
place until he was forced : to appeal to
an American Consul.: The Consul se

- The matter was brought to the at
tention of the Chinese Embassador
and he has written that the enlisting
of recruits is wholly unwarranted by
his Government. He means that it is
a secret effort to revolutionize affairs
in the Chinese empire by unseating
the present dynasty. Colonel English
confirms this statement of the Chinese
Embassador. and adds that the plan
is headed by the nephew of the
Dowager Empress. \
A number of young men have re
ceived commissions during the past

It is estimated that fully 1500 appoint

OMAHA, Nebr., May 23.â Nine
thousand Americans are wanted as'of
ficers of an army of a half million
men which is being raised in China to
overthrow the present dynasty. The
nephew of the Dowager Empress Is at
the head of the movement. General
Edmond F. English, a veteran of the
Civil War, who has been working
quietly in the Middle West for three
months, says he has been floodedwith
applications for commissions.
It has been understood that the of
ficers were wanted for a reorganiza
tion of the imperial army of China.
A week ago General English gave out
a statement, in which he said:
"A reform movement is going on in
China, in every branch of the govern
mental service. I have been" solicited
to secure applications from Americans
of military experience to officer the
Chinese army. The object is to se
cure the best talent possible and to
put the army on a level with the rest
of the world."

The correspondent of the Standard at

there are alarmed because of threats

troops to occupy that place after the

LONDON, May 24.â A dispatch to the

The Morning Post's Shanghai corre

Russians are removing stores and pi"o
visions to Harbin, and that 100 locomo
tives and 800 cars are collected at Liao
yang in readiness to convey passengers
and goods. Therefore, he says, the con

A dispatch to the Daily Telegraph
from Brussels says that the Russian

Hundreds of disguised soldiers are
coming up the river, styling themselves

are well fed, while the Russians are
unable to get food. The Chinese of
ficials are obsequious to Toulisan, who
collects the taxes of the district.
Swarms of disguised Chinese soldiers
are in the vicinity of Liaoyang, and
Chinese troops are guarding the Shan

Russians are having the greatest dif

dynasties. The former is championed
by the bannermen, or privileged class
of Mongols, who hate the Chinese. The
latter are headed by Yuan Shi Kai and

'â¢The Japanese have reported io the
Consul here that a wreck in the Liao
tung Gulf Is dangerous to navigation,
and it is possible that this is the other
ship damaged at Port Arthur on the
15th inst., as the Japanese fleet is
known to have entered the gulf after
the disaster to the Hatsuse.
â¢ The attempt of the Japanese to land
troops in the Gulf of KInchou on the
16th inst, failed, owing to insufficient
water to float the boats.
There has been no fighting in the
vicinity of Port Arthur up to Satur
day last since the Kinchou fight on
the 15th, when two squadrons of Jap
anese cavalry were practically anni
hilated, onlv eight men escaping.
Several unsuccessful attempts were
miide by the Japanese to land troops
at Talienwan last week, it is said.
Of the few soldiers left at Dalny
the majority have gone to Port Aurthr
and the only defenses left there now
are the mines in the harbor.<i
The Russians are now confident of
hording Port. Arthur with the 30,000
men stationed there, exclusive of the
navy and the crowds of mechanics
working on the damaged warships, all
of which, except the Cesarevitch and
the Retvizan, are ready to rejoin the
fleet. These latter vessels will be
ready for sea service by June 1.
The entrance to the harbor, says
the Russian mariner, has been cleared
and small boats now pass in and out
freely from Port Arthur to Dalny.
The forts on the land side of Port
Arthur have been completed and are
now prepared for a severe contest.
REPORTS JAPANESE DEFEAT.
It is not expected that great diffi
culty will be experienced in capturing
the most northerly line of the Russian
works, but the defenses on the semi
circle of hills some three miles from
the dockyard .present a more serious
problem. .They consist" of permanent
works connected by intrenchments not
open to: combined military and naval
assault;'. ;'
ARE PROCEEDING - CAUTIOUSLY.
While the Japanese desire to re
duce Port Arthur with as littte de
lay as possible, they have no intention
of proceeding in a headlong manner.
They do not regard the situation as
calling for such haste as might in
volve disaster to the besieging or as
saulting army. The only thing likely
to bring matters to an immediate cli
max would be the appearance of the
Baltic lleet on the scene. Heavy bom
bardments followed by assaults are
the tactics to be employed against the
fortress.
The captain of a Russian merchant
man, who left Port Arthur on May 20,
Is among the recent arrivals from
Dalny. He says that the whole of the
Japanese fleet had not returned to
Port Arthur since the 15th inst., when,
besides the battleship -^Hatsuse, an
other big vessel struck' a mine and
was towed away disabled. Gunboats
and torpedo-boats returned off the
port on the 20th inst., when the Rus
sians succeeded in sinking a small
gunboat and two torpedo-boats.
CKEFU, May, 23.â During a cruisd
round Liaotung Peninsula, from which
it returned thisÂ«.morning, the dispatch
boat Fawan discovered signs of re
newed naval activity on the part of
Admiral Togo's fleet near Port Arthur
and Dalny. A flotilla of nine torpedo
boats and destroyers was seen proceed
ing in the direction of Port Arthur.
There are indications that the entrance
to the harbor is only partially block
ed. Many .Chinese junks are reported
to have been blown up by the mines
which the Russians have floated, out
into Liaotung Gulf and Liaotshan
channel to the great risk of all ship
ping.

men. The ultimate outcome of the fighting is not stated. Similar reports have reached the Russian
headquarters at Uiaoyang from Chinese sources. The Chinese declare the Japanese made a desperate at
tack on Port Arthur, but were repulsed with enormous losses. No news of the reported battle has come
from an official source, other than the message from the Chefu Consul, but this is explained by the fact
that Port Arthur is cut off from communication.

Clement H. Willis and Mrs. Elenora
Thomas were arrested in this city last
night by Detective Charles Taylor and
Sheriff Trafton of Santa Cruz on war
rants charging them with forgery.
Both are accused of a series of crimes
comrjfltted in Santa Cruz, and, it is
claimed, they have been fugitives from
Justice since last October. Their il
legal transactions netted them about
$400. it is claimed.
Willis, an ex-soldier, lived with Mrs.
Thomas for some time. The latter Is
but 18 years of age. ,It is alleged that
during their sojourn in Santa Cruz he
procured blank checks from the Peo
ple's Bank of that place and induced
the woman to fill them out and sign
them for various amounts. He then
indorsed them, it is claimed, and dis
tributed them among merchants after
having made small purchases, pocket
ing the cash change.
Willis was arrested at a quarry at
San â¢ Bruno road and Twenty-sixth
street. The woman was taken prisoner
in a lodging-house downtown.

to-day and was a very lively, and for
some, unsatisfactory assemblage. M.
F. Tarpey and others were here from
San Francisco to look after the inter
ests of W. R. Hearst. A programme
had been previously arranged by the
Hearst managers and when the con
vention opened this afternoon the
names for the committees were read
and the committees reported ' soon
thereafter. TheYe was a contest over
the Pima County delegation of six
teen'and it is charged by .some that
at a caucus held Sunday . the - entire
programme was prepared v whlch was
put through the convention to-day.
Resolutions were adopted instructing
the delegation to vote for Hearst as
long as his name is before the conven
tion. When the committee on order
of business reported the slate prepar
ed by the caucus it was recommended
to be put through. Pima and other
counties objected and there was a
lively scene for a while. Finally a
motion to adjourn prevailed, al
though the convention had not entire
ly completed its work.

"Bryan and Hearst," he said, "have
nothing in common so far as their po
litical principles are concerned. Hearst
is an imperialist; he stood with Eng
land in the Boer war; he is not a true
Democrat in anything except his anti
trust fight. He will not have- the Ne
braska delegation."
The Importance of this statement will
be seen when it is added that it comes
from a man who will in all probability
be a delegate to the national conven
tion. The same man Insists that the
reorganizers, who are conducting a
fight in Nebraska under the title of the
OMAHA. May 23.â A close friend of
Bryan to-day ridiculed the suggestion
that the success of Bryan in Nebraska
would throw the State into the Hearst
column.

"The Republican State and National
tickets will not be endangered by the
contest. Illinois will roll up its old-time
Republican majority, and It Is absurd
for the Democrats to expect the Repub
licans of our State to rent upon the
national administration any spirit of
ill-nature they might have toward each
other. In fact, I do , not believe ill
nature will mark the campaign, and I
believe firmly that a nomination will
be made which will have the support of
every Republican In the State."
WASHINGTON, May 23.â Senator
Cullom of Illinois, who returned from
Chicago to-day, looks , for a break In
the State convention deadlock when It
reassembles and an early nomination
for the Governorship. He says the
breathing spell will restore harmony.
In speaking of the situation to-night
the Senator said:

JUDGE SLOSS SUSTAINS
THE ACTION OF KERRIGAN
Despite Protest of Collins He Will
Hear Petition of Jenn Pon for
Writ of Certiorari.
The presiding Judge of the Superior
Court has authority to assign cases to
any department he chooses > without
consulting the wishes of the Judge of
the department, or so Judge Sloss de
cided yesterday when he declared
that he would hear, the petition of
Jean Pon for a writ of 'certiorari
growing out of the issuance of war
rants by a Police Judge for the arrest
of Inmates of the resort at 1129 Du
pont street. :
The writ was originally asked for
by Attorney George D. Collins from
Superior Judge Carroll Cook. Judge
Cook issued an alternative writ, made
returnable before him two days later.
In the meantime the petition was filed
and Judge Kerrigan assigned it to
Judge Sloss. When it came up-Attor
ney Collins protested, claiming that it
was a matter over which 'Judge Ker
rigan had no Jurisdiction. Judge
Sloss thinks otherwise and will hear
the petition Just aa if it had , nevÂ«r
passed through . the hands â¢ of Judge
Cook,

An annual report was submitted to
the directors , of the Anti-Saloon
League yesterday. It was by L. M.
Hartley, superintendent of the league.
. Mr. Hartley admitted with chagrin
that the saloons of San Francisco
"hold up" candidates for office. He
said there are 160 churches in San
Francisco and- 3103 saloons, but he
boasted that many low dives had been
closed by the aid of, the league and
the churches.
He also held thatÂ«"the Police Com
missioners have been persuaded to de
termine that no new license shall be
issued to any man within the city and
county of ~an : Francisco. Thus, while
the population is Increasing 25,000 a
year, the increase of saloons Is abso
lutely Interdicted." , ;*Â£&&
Dr. P. A. Parker, national superin-.
tendent of the league, was tendered a
reception. â¢Â¦ He spoke hopefully of the
work of the organization. It was an
nounced at the Christian Ministers'
Association meeting, yesterday that
the State convention of. the Christian
churches will '-take, place, from July
18 to 21 at Santa Cruz. . ? v

BRANDS SMOOT INQUIRY
AS TRICK OF MORMONS
Dr. Driver Says Recent Investigation
Was Planned by the Latter
Dny Saints.
CHICAGO. May 23. â The Reed
Smoot inquiry has been branded as a
"Mormon trick" by John Merritt E.
Driver, speaking in the People's
Church pulpit. According to Dr. Dri
ver, the Mormons sought an investi
gation by the Senate, their object be
ing to gain a publicity that would
bring their doctrines before the peo
ple.
"The wiles of the Mormons are
many and far reaching," said Dr. Dri
ver. "The Smoot case was only a
ruse. President Smith, was not a re
luctant witness. His testimony was
along carefully considered and pre
determined lines. With the Mormons
it was a campaign of education and
familiarization."
The : Board of Supervisors yesterday
decided to make provision in the next
municipal budget for the sweeping and
sprinkling of streets by the city under
the supervision of the Board of Public
"Works. " :
The last named board was instructed
to postpone action on proposals already
submitted by various contractors for
street cleaning. Braunhart, who made
the motion which prevailed, stated that
the Police Department had stopped the
sweeping of . streets at various' times
because it was being improperly done
and was becoming an intolerable nuis
ance.
It was explained that the Merchants'
Association had withdrawn its recom
mendation that the city do Its own
street sweeping because there was no
assurance that it would be done under
civil service regulations. Braunharfs
motion that the Finance Committee
direct full compliance with the civil
service law in the matter prevailed.
He stated that examinations for in
spectors 'and other required officials
could be held at once.
The board referred to the Fire Com
mittee a amended ordinance
providing that to any so-called "class
B" building now erected lo a height of
six stories there may be added not to
exceed two additional stories of the
same average height as the six stories
already erected, notwithstanding 'that
the addition of said stories may make
the building more than one hundred
feet In height, which is the limit al
lowed for class B buildings under the
ordinance.
T. O. Thompson notified the board
that in issuing the certificate for satis
factory completion of Harrison street,
between Twenty-fourth and Twenty
fifth, the responsible officer has neglect
ed to inspect it at all owing to the fact
that the street is not now and never
has been in condition.
A representative of the Henry Cowell
Lime Company objected to the award
of a contract to the Western Fuel Com
pany to furnish cement to the Board of
Public Works at $1 80 a barrel. He
stated that the bid of the Cowell Com
pany was '$186 -a barrel delivered,
whereas the Western Fuel Company's
bid was for the cement not delivered,
but that It had filed a letter subse
quently In which it agreed to deliver
the cement for the same price. The
matter was rereferred to the commit
tee which had recommended that the
award be made to the Western Fuel
Company.
The petition, of the Sutter Street Im
provement* Club- that- 1 Sutter street be

An lmrcrtant decision was handed
Govm yesterday by the United States
Circuit Court of Appeals reversing: the
Judgment of conviction In the case of
the United States against Harry Owens,
charged with the killing of Carl Cbris
tiensen Is Alaska. The evidence was to
the Â«2ect that Chrlstiensen went to
Owens' cabin armed with a butcher
knife and tried to kill Owens, and that
In the combat Owens stabbed his as
sailant to death. A dissenting opinion
was filed by Judge Gilbert, the ma
jority opinion having been filed by
Judges Ross and Hawley.
The majority opinion holds that the
lower court ignored the well sustained
doctrine that where one Is attacked by
another with a deadly weapon the par
ty attacked may, if he does eo honestly
and In good faith, safely act in the light
of his Burroundinps and on the appear
ances before him at the time; 'for the
court distinctly and specifically in
structed the jurv that, 'of. the necessity
of the defendant's protecting himself
you are the judge, and not the defend
ant.' "
The dissenting opinion holds that it
is doubtful whether the error is such
as to justify a reversal of the judg
ment.

MURDER SCARE ONI;Y A
FLASH IN THE PAX
TEAS LEAD EVENTS
Turner insists that he did not go to
fighting until Aitken had shot a wicked
right into his face. The Councilman
says he was impelled to use his knowl
edge of the boxing game because the
Engineer tried to throw him out of the
ofilce after consigning him to Infernal
regions.
Turner avows that he would not have
lost his temper had not the Council
man said the Engineer was to blame
The encounter occurred in the City
Engineer's office, on Fourteenth street,
in the old public library building. The
cause was a dispute over the projected
Twenty-third avenue storm drainage
sewer, a j?lan fathered by Aitken. Be
hind this is a personal grudge between
the men growing out of a political fight
three years ago.
Turner and Aitken came to blows
after the City Engineer had ordered
the Councilman out of his office and
started to eject him forcibly. Aitken
retaliated by punching Turner in the
eye. The Engineer returned with a
swinging right that caught the Seventh
Warder square on thfe optic, badly dis
coloring it. There were a variety of
swings and straight arm jolts before
Deputy City Engineer J. B. McMath
played referee, stepping between the
belligerent city officials and stopping
the bout.
OAKLAND, May 23.â Two more or
less blackened eyes on their respective
countenances is the result of a fisticuff
engagement which occurred at dusk
Saturday night between City Engineer
F. C. Turner and City Councilman G.
E. Aitken.
There will be no arrests. Three years
ago Aitken was actively opposed to
Turner's candidacy for City Engineer.
After the municipal election Turner's
vote as Fire Commissioner assisted in
turning Aitken out of the fire depart
ment. Hence the personal feeling.
Turner's story is much yie same, ex
cept that he says the discussion on Ait
ken's side became personally abusive
and that the Councilman declared the
people' of Twenty-third avenue were
tired of the long delay and would use
\t politically against the Engineer. He
said:
I told Aitken that If there had been neg
ligence he was to blame. He replied it was
my fault and I said if anybody felt that way
about it he could ro to the devil. Then Aitken
abused me violently. I ordered him out atÂ»d
the trouble becan. I lost ray temper and
must apologize to the, people of Oakland for
th? occurrence.
I called on Turner to hasten plans for the
sewer, which the people in my district are
very anxtous should bo completed. We had
words about readvertlslns the plan because
Turner said the pipes would have to be
chained to drain a new bonk building cellar
at East Fourteenth street and Twenty-third
avenue. When he eald there would be more
delay I was put. out and finally told him our
people had decided to make no change In ths
original plans.
Turner got hot, said 1 could go to the devil
and ordered me out of the olflce. Then I
declared I wouldn't go unless he apologized
and he replied with a smash. I knocked him
down and when he got up I was starting
out when he hit me In th<Â» eye.
Aitken's explanation follows:
for the long delay there had been over
completing plans for the proposed
sewer. Both men had cooled off over
Sunday and expressed regret for the
occurrence.

PROMINENT OAKLAND OFFICIAL. AND COUNCILMAN G. E. AITKEN, WHO EN

THE RESULT OF AN ARGUMENT OVER A STORM DRAINAGE SEWER.
The police have been on the trail of
the people who interfered with Mrs.
Curtis' assailant all day and hope to
find the man through them. They also
suspect a certain young man in West
Berkeley who has been acting queerly
of late, and mean to arrest him if they
find any tell-tale scratches on his face.
There is much of mystery about the
vicious attack that was made upon
aged Mrs. Mary Curtis at her home,
1133 University avenue, last night by
an unknown young man. The assailant
was sober and did not intend robbery.
Mrs. Curtis has no enemies, so the rea
son for the attack is probably to be
sought in insanity.
It is the genera! belief that Berkeley
is in for a series of brutal and ruth
less attacks by a * # Jack""the Swatter,"
similar in character to those that
alarmed the people of Alameda awhile
ago.
Mrs. Curtis suffered so much from
her injuries to-day that she could not
leave her bed. She is 74 years old. In
spite of her infirmity, however, Mrs.
Curtis fought with desperation against
her assailant, and to this resistance
she probably owes her life. In behalC
of her mother, Mrs. Edward Brennan,
one of Mrs. Curtis' daughters, told the
following story of the assault:
"Mother was standing Just inside our
gate looking out upon the street. Sud
denly and without warning she was
attacked from behind. A young man
she had not seen grabbed her and be
gan to pummel her. To protect herself
she fought back, and succeeded in
scratching the fellow severely. But her
strength roon gave way and she fell
to the ground.
"While she lay there he kept on kick
ing and pummeling her until two young
couples came along and stopped him.
The strange part of it is, though, that
they did not arrest him. The attack
was seen by some people on a passing
car, but no attempt was made to inter
fere. In fact, it was not until several
hours afterward that the police were
notified."

The Associated Charities has for
some time desired to investigate
enses of indigenry reported to the
Board of Supervisors for relief in or
der 1 to protect the county and the va
rious charitable organizations from
imposition by unworthy persons.
This morning, after discussing the
proposition at some length, the board
passed a resolution to grant permis
sion to the association to make the
necessary investigation on condition
that a full report be made in each in
stance to the Board of Supervisors.
The plan will be adopted provided
there is no legal obstacle In the way
and on condition that the work can
be done at an expense not to exceed
S400 a year.
The Investigations by the associa
tion will be confined to the city dis
tricts of Supervisors Howe, Mitchell
and Kellj-, and the final decision in all
cases will rest with the Board of Su
pervisors, the Associated Charities
acting merely as an investigating
agent.
At the meeting of the board this
morning the association was repre
sented by President B. H. fVindleton.
Miss C. Anita Whitney. James P. Tay
lor and D. Edward Collinp. The mat
ter was referred to the District Attor
ney for an opinion as to its legality.

jn charge of her missing son. When
the mother returned this evening she
found Gabriel, the girl and the boxes
KO!;e.and nothing left bthind to indi
cate what had become of thorn.
At the outset she feared that a bur
glary had been committed. After the
police had completed their investiga
tion the decision vas reached that a
search begin at once for the missing
ones. Mrs*. Borro told the police she
believed the affair had been arrans^d.

LOS ANGELES, May 23.â The Meth
odist General Conference at the open
ing- of its fourth and last week's labor
found itself confronted with a duty
almost unprecedented in the history of
the Methodist churchâ that of acting
upon the resignation of one of its
Bishops-elect. Rev. Dr. James R. Day,
chancellor of the Syracuse University,
who on . last Saturday was chose'a as
the last of the eight Bishops elected
by the present conference, resigned his
place in the episcopacy board and was
excused, at his request, from further
attendance upon the conference
Dr. Day resigned the blshropic be
cause, he said, he believed it was God's
will that he retain the chancellorship
of Syracuse University and because he
considered his election to the . Episco
pacy due to excitement and sympathy
in his behalf occasioned by a scurri
lous article published by the Examiner
on Saturday morning.
Besides acting upon Bishop Day's
resignation, the conference ' to-day
heard the report of the tellers x>n the
vote taken Saturday afternoon for
three missionary Bishops, which show
ed the election of Dr. I. B. Scott as an
additional missionary Bishop to Africa
and Dr. William F. Oldham and Dr.
John K. Robinson as additional mis
sionary Bishops in Southern Asia. Dr.
C. M. Harris was elected on the bal
lot taken this morning to the misslori
arv blshropic of Japan and Korea, a
new district created by the present
conference. Thursday, May 2C, was
fixed upon as the date for the conse
cration ceremonies of the seven newly
elected general superintendents and
four missionary Bishops. Two hours
c-f to-day's session were devoted to
special memorial service in honor of
the memory of the Bishops who have
died during the last quadrennium and
to the late President William McKlnley.
A motion by Dr. J M. Buckley of New
York to proceed to ballot for a suc
cessor to Dr. Jt* R. Day, resigned," was
defeated and the conference voted to
postpone indefinitely the further elec
tion of general superintendents. The
action of the conference on last Sat
urday in excluding the representatives
of a local newspaper from press privi
leges was rescinded upon motion of Dr.
Buckley, seconded by Judge C. B. Lohr
of Delaware. . Â£ K
RESIGNATION" A SURPRISE.
The resignation of Bishop-elect J. R.
Day, following closely after his elec
tion after a long contest, furnished the
Â¦ensatlon of the conference. The in
tention of Dr. Day to resign was not
known to the vast body of delegates, as
he had confided, it only to a few inti
mate friends in the matter. Bishop
Foss, who was the presiding officer at
this morning's session, gave . the first
intimation of what was to follow when
"If you ask me why I did not appre
ciate that before I had put you to the
trouble of my election, I can only say
that some things which for years have
hung around the circumference of our
j thoughts in distance and dim outline
suddenly come to us as revelations,
forcing us to conclusions. I have
reached my decision after opening my
mind prayerfully to appeals of duty
from every side and every source of
light possible to me. I cannot con
scientiously say that I believe myself
moved by the Holy Ghost to take upon
myself the office and duties of a Bish
op, as our law requires of those who
are consecrated to that holy office and
ministry, but I do feel myself deeply
moved to continue in the work'of Chris
tian education. Therefore, with the
greatest reverence for your â¢ wisdom
and authority and with keen distress
that I must disappoint, those who have
elected me to, this high office, and re
gretting to Rave caused a moment's
.delay in your important business, and
thanking you without attempting the
Impossible task of finding words ade
quate to express my sense of indebted
ness to you, I submit herewith, most
respectfully, my resignation of the of
fice of Bishop to which you have elect
ed me. I venture to make one request
of- youâ give me your confidence and
belief that I have sought honestly to
find' my duty in the fear of God and
In all good conscience."
There was a distinct sensation among
the delegates when Dr. Day finished
\reading his reasons for " resignation.
Dr. J. M. Buckley was recognized, and
after stating that he had unsuccess
fully endeavored in every way possible
to induce Blshop-elec^ Day to abandon
his intention to resign, said the con
ference had a perfect legal right to nul
lify Us act of election. He cited as a
precedent the case of Bishop-elect
Joshua Soles, who was chosen by the
General Conference of 1820 and who re
signed before being: consecrated. He
then moved that Bishop Day's resigna
tion be accepted, and the conference
adopted : the motion Â¦ without discussion
by a unanimous vote. Upon request of
Dr. Day the conference then excused
him from further, attendance upon the
sessions and he will return at once to
Syracuse.
he asked the conference to hear a priv
ileged statement by Bishop-elect Day.
Permission was promptly granted and
when Bishop Day arose and Â¦ walked
to the presiding officer's table with a
written document in. his hand there
was instant attention.
After a brief prefatory statement,
in which he said he was sure that no
man would charge him with acting
from motives other than those of an
honest, conscientious and God-fearing
man, he read a lengthy statement con
cerning his determination to relinquish
the high official position to which he
had just been elected. .
"Since my election." he said, "I have
thought of nothing for scarcely a con
scious moment/ but my duty to the
church, of which you are the chosen
representatives, and I could not more
profoundly and sincerely revere your
friendship, which has placed me under
a sense of obligation that dwarfs 'my
powers to pay this debt of gratitude. I
have the witness within myself that I
am not influenced by material advan
tage or honor. These are too uncertain,
evanescent and remotely incidental to
be considered for a moment in a matter
of so great import. But new factors
are in every problem; they solve my

OAKLAND, May 23. â Another play
which is new to the Oakland stage
was presented this evening at the
Liberty Theater by the Neill Com
pany and will continue during the
present week. The play is the famous
Daly comedy. "Nancy & Co.," which,
although it was first produced nearly
eighteen years ago, has never before
been seen in this city. The play was
adapted from a German farce by the
late Augustln Daly.
Miss Edythe Chapman in the char
acter of Nancy Brasher, a young
woman of a very impulsive disposition
and original ideas, made an unusual
ly favorable impression this evening,
and James Neill as Tippy Brasher, her
husband, was a well managed and
obedient spouse. The other members
of the company are becoming well
known to Oakland audiences.

Agriculturist of University
Tells About the Effect
of the Controlling Law
Berkeley Office San" Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, May 23.
In a bulletin Issued at the University
of California to-day George Roberts,
instructor in agricultural chemistry,
describes at some length the applica
tion and effects of the law passed by
the last Legislature to regulate the
fertilizer industry, in this State. A
large part of the bulletin is devoted to
figures to show the results he obtained
in the analysis of the fertilizers on the
market of this Sta^te. Of the eighty
two brands analyzed all were found to
come up to the standard and to contain
the ingredients claimed for them by the
manufacturers.
The law' is to protect the farmers
against impure fertilizers. Acting in
accordance with this law, twenty-one
manufacturers registered 176 brands of
fertilizers and from among them the
eighty-two brands analyzed were se
lected. Regarding the results of his in
vestigations, Mr. Roberts say?:
"Nearly all the goods sold in this
State are pretty well up to guarantee.
Especially Is this true of goods put on
the market after the law went into
effect. In some instances a brand has
been short in one or two ingredients,
but had a compensating excess in the
others. This increased the value. I
found that a large number of brands
were not on the market."
Supervisor H. D. Rowe gave notice
at to-day's meeting that he would call
up the matter of a contract for a new
vault in the County Treasurer's office
at the next meeting and would then
move to reject ah bids for thl3 work.
The merit of the dispute between
rival factions of the Union Labor par
ty, who have petitioned the Board of
Supervisors for recognition as the only
real County Central Committee of that
party, was not decided by the board
to-day. The matter was continued two
weeks and it is believed will be forced
into the courts. i
Notice was served by C S. MacMul
lan on the Board of Supervisors to-day
that he would hold it responsible in
case it Daid out of the county general
fund the sum of $21,790 80 he asserts
is due him on aTcontract entered into
with|the board whereby he was to re
ceive 50 per cent of all the taxes col
lected upon assessable property he
could discover that had been overlook
ed by the Assessor. He claims that
$43,581 60 has accrued to the county as
a result of his efforts and claims half
of it. v

A Michigan burglar, who seems to have neglected the
lessons of many years devoted to 4iis thieving craft, was
sentenced the other day to serve the remainder of his life
in a penitentiary for stealing three dollars and two hats.
It is highly probable that all self-respecting members of
the, fraternity of burglars will accept the court's decree
as just retribution for an'; idiocy so palpable as that ex
hibited by the offender in being caught for so small a
matter. ~-
The first machine gun of ayy note
was the Gatling. The original Gatling
had ten barrels placed in a circle, with
a breech mechanism so arranged that
by turning a crank these barrels were
successively fired, the cartridges being
placed in a small hopper situated on
the top of the gun. The Hotchkiss was
a similar gun, having a similar ar
rangement of barrels, but a totally
different form of mechanism. The
Hotchkiss system, however, was used
for a larger type of ammunition than
the Gatling. The French mitrailleuse
had thirty barrels. They all were load
ed at the same time and all fired sim
ultaneously. The recoil was so great
that it had to be mounted in the same
manner as a field piece, on a heavy
carriage requiring six horses. The ap
paratus was clumsy, difficult to oper
ate and had a comparatively slow rate
of fire. The Nordenfeldt gun consists
of a series of barrels arranged side by
side, like organ pipes. The Nordenfeldt
gun generally has five barrels and the
mechanism Is worked by a lever, the
cartridges falling down from a hopper
on the top of the arm into position,
where the mechanism thrusts them into
the barrel, fires them and extracts the
empty case. This gun is of great sim
plicity and for a time went into exten
sive use.
The hand-worked machine gun, how
ever, has given place to a totally dif
ferent form of arm, having ; but one
barrel, and is known as the automatic
gun. which was one of my own inven
tions.âSir Hiram Maxim, In Harper's

BORDERING on Mono at the north, San Bernar
dino at the south, and Fresno and Tulare counties
on the west, lies the great county of Inyo. As a sec
tion rich in minerals it has long been widely known. Mil
lions of dollars have been taken from its mines of pre
cious metals. Death Valley, incalculably rich in borax and
presumably rivaling Chile in nitrates, is within its wide
spreading border lines. For an eastern neighbor it has
It is the point of departure for Mount Whitney for
many tourists and mountaineers. In addition to these
endowments the county is rarely picturesque' and has a
geographical position that qualifies it to become a sure
and reliable supply point for many products of the soil
to Nevada and to a wide range of country. ,
For many years it has been known, that Inyo County,
by reason of its elevation above th^sea level, in some
sections is admirably adapted to â¢ the pfxiduouon of ap
ples. The county area embraces every conceivable vari
ety of temperature, from the coolness of the high Sierra
to the heat of Death Valley.
The chief desideratum has been the construction of a
system to distribute the water that runs, through the
county, but is of comparatively little' avail for agricul
tural uses under existing circumstances. Light in this
direction has begun to dawn upon Inyo and the people
of the county are correspondingly pleased.
The systematic researches of the departments of the
Federal Government's service known as trie irrigation
investigation and the geological survey , have, during the
past few years, proceeded far in the determination of the
arnounts of water that arc available for irrigation in this"
and other States west of the Rocky Mountains and "also
in the ascertainment of available^ reservoir sites, the de
tails of construction work, necessary- for the founding of
irrigation upon an enduring basis and the calculation of
irrigable areas, together with crop probabilities and re
lated topics pf first importance.. Now a report has been
filed by Chief Hydrographer Lippincott of the Geological
Survey concerning Inyo County. The essential point in
this is that it is estimated there is enough water flowing
through Owens Valley to moisten sufficiently for agri
cultural purposes practically "every acre in the valley.
This comprehends, of. course, the impounding of the sur
plus water at certain times for. economical use at others.
A canal, so finds Mr. Lippincott, would .be capable of
providing water for bringing into use a large area that is
AWAKENING FOR INYO.
The Republican platform represents the constructive
purpose of the party. It recites, using the noble rhetoric
of understatement, the work done in the past and the
steps taken to advance us to the position of the world's
creditor nation, by giving us sound money and a creative
power that makes the world our debtor. No guarantee
of the future is offered except the purpose to continue
therein the constructive work of the past.
Let a patriotic Democrat read that platform and say
whether he can object to any part of it. It speaks for
the protective policy; so does the Democratic platform.
That' difference is eliminated. It declares for an Amer
ican merchant marine. So does the Democratic plat
form. It wants a sufficient navy, the Panama canal,
Chipese exclusion, protection of American citizens at
home and abroad, the preservation of forests and the
reclamation of our arid domain. Does any Democrat
object to any of these things? Does any doubt that, in
view of its capacity for action, the Republican party will
work for their accomplishment?
New duties are upon us as a nation. The prejudice
against the Republican party held by Democrats inheres
in history and relates to anti-slavery, the Civil War and
the reconstruction period. But those issues are all past
and accomplished. The party must be judged by its
present aspects and tried by its relation to things of the
present and the future. So judged, what reason, outside
of prejudice, is there for refusing to support it?
THE platform adopted by the Republican State Con
vention may well be taken as a model by the Na
tional Convention. It is all said in less than> 500
words. Yet it is a complete statement of the party's
principles, policy and achievements. It 'is conceived in
the belief that such a statement is sufficient reason for a
continuance of power, and that any indictment of the
Democracy is unnecessary. Therefore there is no "view
ing with alarm" nor ringing accusations, such as make
up the body of the Democratic platform. The hopeful
view of the future and the sane analysis of the reasons
for that view widely differentiate the two parties.

In his philanthropic labor he is ably
seconded by his sister. Miss Constance
FJrirbairn. who is also deaf and dumb.
To enumerate all the associations for
promoting the welfare of the deaf with
which Sir Arthur is connected would
require a long catalogue. The various
oQIces he fills in them are no sinecures.
They entail a vast amount of corre
spondence and much' traveling. Any
invention, idea or suggestion which
promises increased educational facili
ties or other advantages for those who
dwell in eilence receives his prompt at
tention, and support if good for any

Though he cannot talk there are few
men in England who "address", more
public meetings in various parts of the
country, his audiences being like him

"speak" as rapidly and, judging by the
eflect on adtpts in sign language, quite
as eloquently and persuasively as many
who have a wide reputation for ora

deaf is deemed complete without a
"speech" from the baronet. His home"
in Brighton reveals his many-sided
culture! Beautiful pictures hang on

with books. Many rare works of art
end"historic mementoes adorn the vari
ous apartments. Travel is one of his
passions. He has been all over Eu
rope and has visited the principal cities
in the United States. His collection of
brie-a-brac is largely the result of these
peregrinations. Some of the objects
were discovered in slums In Paris,
Christiania or New York. A lock of
the great Napoleon's hair, finely framed
and accompanied by three autograph
documents attesting- Its. genuineness,
was bought by Sir Arthur In a mean
little back street in Paris for six louis.
It stands near to an exquisite vase, a
gift from the Emperor William I, who
in his old age humiliated the descend
ants of the man who wore that hair.
This superb vase, with Its artful Cupids
upholding a female form, was the
Kaiser's present to Sir Arthur's father,
who was chairman of the great Man
chester exhibition of 1856 and of the
International Exhibition in London in
1R62. Another large vase was the gift
of the third Napoleon, as well as an
exquisite tea service, each piece marked
with the imperial cypher and crown.
Sir Arthur is now 52 years old. He
enjoys vigorous health, which may be
attributed to the fact that despite the
great amount of hard work he does ho
finds time to indulge his tastes as a
sportsman with the rod and gun.
Cycling is another form of recreation
of which he Is very fond.'

The French Duel
Recent legal actions growing out of a
fatal duel in Paris between Charles
Ebelot and Henri Lautier show Row
dueling is regarded by the French law.
Ebelot, the survivor, was charged with
"having by blows and wounds caused
death unintentionally." Judging from
the wording of the indictment, the law
does not take duelists seriously, or it
would not admit the supposition that
they do not enter into the encounter
with any deadly intention. In this case
proof was forthcoming that the affair
had been carried out fairly, according
to the recognized rules of the duello,
and the prisoner was acquitted. The
family of the deceased took no part In
the criminal prosecution, but obtained,
in the civil action, one franc damages
and costs.
Goethe and Panama.
In view of the formal taking over
by the United States of the Panama
canal works. It may be worth recall
ing, as an instance of the political pre
science of Goethe, that, so long ago as
1827, in the course of a conversation
with Eckermann, he declared it to be
indispensable that the United States
should have such a passage between
the Mexican Gulf and the Pacific, and
he was sure they would execute it, al
though he would not live to see its ac
complishment. On the same occasion
the poet also expressed the wish that
he might see the Danube and the
Rhine linked together by a waterway,
and, thirdly, the English in posesssion
of a canal from Suez. To see the reali
zation of these three great projects
would, he declared, be worth living
fifty years longer. â Westminster Ga

"In certain parts of the Himalaya
Mountains the native women have a
singular way of putting their children
to sleep in the middle of the day. The
child is put near a stream of water,
and by means of a palm leaf or tin
scoop the water is deflected so as to
run over the back of the child's head.
The water pouring on the child's head
apparently sends It to slep and keep*
it so, while the mother proceeds with
her work in the field. No one seems
ever to fear that the baby may bo

When the Empress Dowager dies there will be a for
ward movement in China. The spirit of progress is a
ferment among the people. The large number of
Chinese who have been educated in the United States
and Great Britain see the reforms that are needed.
Prince Pu.Lun, who is now in this country, will probably
be Emperor of China in a short time. He is an -en
lightened man who knows the world arid appreciates the
importance of conforming to its standards. With him as
ruler at Peking we will not have a China like India un
der the Moguls, or the Khanates under Russia. But we
will have a country awakened as Japan is. Not with am
bitions directed against other nations, but confined to in
ternal progress and development.
Such a China will build railroads and distribute its con
gested population tp a more roomy field. It will have
more wants, demand more exchanges with other nations
and will put the physical force of four hundred millions
of people into self-elevation and civilization. The yel
low peril will be made a myth by equality of wants and
standards with the rest of the world. With such' a
transformation in prospect the apparent Russian plan of
campaign will result in undisputed Chinese sovereignty
of Manchuria by command of the world. -
IT is evidently the Russian policy to retire to Siberia
in the hope that the Japanese will attempt to follow.
If the Japanese content themselves to free Man
churia of the Russian forces and restore ic intact to
Chinese administration Russia will doubtless wait until
it is safe to assume the aggressive and again move into
that province.
But the world wants peace and stability in Eastern
Asia. Japan, content with the control of Korea, may call
upon the nations for a guarantee against further turmoil
lhat would be caused by another advance upon Man
chrria". We are unable now to see why such a call to the
world should not be heeded. China is placing herself in
the right attitude by going beyond her treaties and de
claring ports open to all nations as fast as Russian in
fluence is withdrawn. We think it is the right conclu
sion of all who wisely observe events and soundly fore
cast the future that it is best that China preserve her
territorial integrity.

the galleon In the course of a few days.
The success already obtained has
caused great excitement.
Some astonishment is expressed that
the galleon should have been found in
tact, as In many previous attempts
that have been made by treasure hunt
ers dynamite has been used, and It was
feared much damage was done.
A female, generously characterized as a woman, cre
ated a sensation in a local court recently by seeking to
kiss a man who was accused of an atrocious murder and
on trial for his life. This is very clearly an indication
that the time has come when men facing the desperate
emergency of a jury's decision need and should receive
the protection of the police. No man should be punished
dntil his guilt'is established.
It has been said that no man should
perpetrate a joke who would not be
willing to take a Joke in return. An
Instance brought to memory by the
story that appeared In The .Call a few
days since, telling how Alexander Bad
lam secreted lead under a wheelbar
row, exemplifies this truth.
Badlam In his day was one always
ready to Joke with his acquaintances,
but strange to say could not accept a
Joke when the tables were turned on
himself. At the time he was Assessor
It was his habit to drive his horse and
buggy into the basement of the City
Hall and hitch the animal up until it
was time to drive home. At that day
there was a poor, little hunchback ele
vator boy attending to the crude rope
elevator in the hall. This little crip
ple conceived the idea one day of
hitching Badlam's horse and reversing
him in the buggy, placing his head
toward the seat and In that position j
fastly securing him. By using the har
ness and some ropes which he found
in the building he made a good job of
the operation. Then he gave the tip
to the City Hall employes to be on
hand to witness Badlam's discomfiture
when he appeared on the scene.
The gang was on hand and lost no
time in enjoying the joke. Not so
with the man at whose expense it
was played. The Assessor got good

The local government board recently !
had its attention called to a case in
which a workhouse attendant was sus- <
pended by the guardians for acting as ;
a bookmaker to tl\e pauper inmates.
The case would never have been J
broached but that a gambler lost his i
head and "gave the show-' away," be- j
cause he had not been paid the Â£5 1
he considered he had won over a bet
on the Derby. The disclosure will
arouse the poor-law authorities all j
over the country, no doubt, but it is I
not easy to perceive what steps they j
ran take to stop gambling in work
houses.
Moreover, betting on races is not by
any means the only form of gam
bling paupers enjov: it is the favorite
where it can be indulged, but where !
paupers cannot make use of their at- j
tendants and friends for the purpose
of "backing their fancy," they can
generally find some other means,
though tamer, of investing their hum
drum lives with a little excitement.
During his walks abroad in search
of "copy," the writer has met a num
ber of persons who have been "cer
tified paupers," and has discussed with
some of them this secret feature of
workhouse life, with the result of com
ing to the conclusion that the poor
house inmate who does not gamble in
some way when he can procure the
wherewithal is the exception rather
than the rule.
With many paupers nothing is too
trifling or uncertain to excite bets be
tween themselves; the change of diet,
the weather, somebody's chances of
taking dismissal from the workhouse
and other trivial things all are fair
game.
Pence and small silver are laid on
and against any possible event,' and
generally paid by friends of the loser
to friends of the winner, to be held In
trust. And the exactitude with which
such people and their friends treat
"debts of honor" could not be im
proved on by thÂ» richest members of
the aristocracy.
Paupers have dismissed themselves
in order to go and seek work In order
to earn money with which to pay
such debts, and others have dismissed
themselves In order to go and enjoy
the fruits of their gambling. ''' r Vv
Some of _ the latter have established
themselves In trades, â¢ to the reduc
tion of the rates, on money thus ac
quired. Nevertheless, not one guardian

gambling to be carried on, but It is an
astonishing fact, which, however, re
flects no discredit on the authorities,
that there are really few workhouses
In the country where secret gambling
does not obtain in some form or other.
Many hundreds of pounds are lost
and won by dwellers in the work
houses of this country in the course of
every year. Thousands of bets do not
exceed a few pence, but some do run
to such large figures that paupers dis
miss themselves on the strength of
their successes and never enter the
poorhouse again.
The Idea of a pauper laying four or
five pounds on a race sounds ridicu
lously extravagant, but such bets, and
others bigger, are made in workhouses,
thot|gh, of course, comparatively rarely.

straight from a workhouse! The stock
and goodwill of the business were
bought with money won by the old
man on simple bets during the time he
was .''chargeable on the parish"; he
boasts of it. though he is careful not
to 5av what workhouse he patronized,
less trouble might accrue to himself.
No doubt the majority of workhouse
gamblers are losers Instead of winners,
as their betting is scarcely ever done
among themselves, but cither with or
through attendants or friends outside;
and the racing intelligence which pene
trates into workhouses is not often suf
ficient to make for success in betting.
That attendants should sometimes
lend themselves to such secret gam
bling ways is nothing very extraor
dinary, for they are never so hand
somely paid for their duties as to be
raised above the temptation to add to
their incomes.
When they discover from a word here
and a hint there that their charges are
still victims of the gambling passion
which they used to indulge when out
side. It is hardly to be wondered that
they consent to make small "books"
or to act on commission for bookmak
ers outside the asylum.
And the thing once begun keeps roll
ing.
We would like to see these partisans who think that
they are disciples of Jefferson give their followers the
benefit of a free quotation of some of his opinions. For
instance, be wrote John Jay, in 1785, this opinion of la
boring mechanic?: "Were we perfectly free to decide this
question I should reason as follows: We have now lands
enough to employ an infinite number of people in their
cultivation. Cultivators of the earth are the most valu
able citizens. They are the most vigorous, the mo^t in
dependent, the most virtuous, and they are tied to their
country and wedded to its liberty and interests by the
most lasting bonds. As long, therefore, as they can find
employment in this line I would not convert them into
mariners, artisans or anything else. But our citizens will
find employment in this line till their numbers become
too great, as will their productions, for the demand both
internal and foreign. This is not yet the case and proba
bly will not be for a considerable time. As soon as it is
the surplus of hands must be turned to something else.
I should then, perhaps, wish to turn them to |hc sea in
preference to manufactures, because, comparing the char
acters of the two classes, I find the former the most
valuable citizens. I consider the class of artificers as the
panders of vice and the instruments by which the liberties
of a country are overturned." /
May we venture to suggest that this^opinioa Jtiferion
held about the artificers, the mechanics and skilled labor
ers would make interesting reading in a Democratic plat
form? He regarded them as "the panders of vice" and the
destroyers of liberty. So we have the two figures in the
Democratic hall of heroes and of statuary, Jefferson and
Hearst, already at war in their diverse and irreconcila
ble opinions about labor. The debate waxes hot and Mr.
Jefferson accuses Mr. Hearst of trying to use the pan
ders of vice to destroy the institutions of liberty.' Call
out the police and perhaps the fire department, for there's
a riot on the Democratic pedestal.
Every record left by Jefferson commits him against
such a policy.' He abhorred classes and class solidarity
in public matters. He opposed much government, in
sisted that government had no business to be in busi
ness and that its functions were confined to its legitimate
police powers, leaving men free . as possible to pursue
happiness and fortune. ' When he heard his fellow statue
advocate the classification of society, appeal to malice
and envy as the sole motives of political action and pro
pose that one class only shall have a voice in government,
the author of the Declaration of Independence would yell
for. the step ladder that he might climb down off a perch
with such an uncongenial companion.
IT is unusual when a campaign is coming on to hear a
great deal of Democratic talk about Mr. Jefferson.
The further away from his ideas a so-called Demo
crat gets the more he invokes the founder of his party
as he claims. In fact there is but little in common be
tween Jefferson and the modern Democratic party. He
founded what he called the Republican party,- laid on
lines that, were rational in his day and from! his point of
view. But he would not now be found in the Democratic
party, for it advocates a style of socialism and commun
ism entirely at variance with his principles.
As the California Democracy have put Hearst and Jef
ferson on the same pedestal, a sort of Castor and Pollux
to lead the hosts in battle, it would be interesting if the
two could discuss public questions in the hearing of
their admirers. Mr. Hearst advocates a political party
made up of a distinct labor class. He wants the ar
tificers to go by themselves and make a party that will
advocate government ownership of all utilities, govern
ment regulation of hours and wages, â. and an extensive
programme of socialism carried out by a self-constituted
class.

The Inyo Register unquestionably voices the belief of
the people of the county when it says, "If the irrigation
canal enterprise is decided upon and finished Inyo will
have such a. boom as it never has had." Â¦/

seph Manne. an able seaman, who was
the worst injured, tells the following
story:
Â«? I am a Russian by birth and am 20 years
old and reside at 414 Folsom street. This
morning 1 went Into the forecastle to change
my shoes and smelt a peculiar gassy odor. I
think some of the gasoline must have been
leaking out of the barrels.
BURNING LANTERN IX HOLD.
Somebody had left a lantern burning there,
and all of a sudden the lantern flame seemed
to shoot up. I started to go toward it to
put it out. when the explosion took place.
The <Utk lifted under me and I was thrown
down. I Jumped up and rushed to the com
panion way, which I found had been blown
away. In another Instant a second explosion
followed, and I found myself In the bay. I
struck out for the nearest wharf, where I was
pulled out of the water and then taken to the
hospital. I am Buffering terrible agony.
Manne undoubtedly owes his life to
his powerful physique and muscular
frame. He is six feet tall and weighs
about 225 pounds. With his terrible
burns it is a marvel to all who saw
him how he managed to swim so far.
His hair and eyebrows .were complete
ly burned off and his face is a mass
of lacerated flesh, which is now com
pletely encased in a mask. His hands
are terribly burned and there are
more than fifty bad bruises on his
body.
First Mate Knut Knudsen says he
v.'as thrown "with the deck more than
fifty feet Into the air and landed in
the water. When he was Ashed out,
to his amazement he found that he
had only suffered a slight bruise on
the right knee and was able to walk
ta the hospital to have it dressed.
Al Carter, a laboring man, who was
standing on the dock at the time of
th<Â» explosion, had his face scorched
and had to go to the hospital. Boat
man McOee of Peterson's fleet was
passing at the time on his way to
Hunters Point. He gives the follow
ing description of the explosion:
ROSE OUT OF THE WATER.
I was looking at the schooner, when sud
denly there was a slight report and she seemed
tocome right out of the water. At the name
time hui,-Â» pieces of her decks and great big
barrels wfcre tosse<l- into the air. The whole
thing was in flame* from stem to stern at the
came time. There was a. terrible roaring and
crashing sound, and cans and barrels were
dropping all around me like so many sticks
from lire rockets. The blaze was tremendous
and the smell of the black smoke mi some
thing sickening. There was such a mass of
stuff thrown into the air that I could not see
what It looked like. Afterward I heard that
the crew was blown up with the rest of the
stuff, and if any of them live to tell the tale
it Is a wonder.
The little vessel was 21 years old
and of 222 tons burden. She has
been plying in the coast trade until
recently, when her owners, Sudden Â»t
Chrlstensen, leased her to the Seattle
Shipping Company to take this cargo
of oil to Nome. She was valued nl
about $8000, partly insured. Her car
go was valued at about $30,000, the
principal portion of which was the
property of the Standard Oil Com
pany, with full Insurance placed in
the East. The other shippers were
Charles Kunze and the Seattle Ship
ping Company. Whether their inter
ests were protected by â¢ insurance
could not be learned.
It was reported on the street that
M. C. Harrison & Co., managers of the
St. Paul Insurance Company, were
carrying a line of $16,000 on the car
go. This they deny, but state that
they had expected to write a line for
aome of the shippers and that the
pending negotiations would probably
have been consummated to-day. The
shippers, however, had not given
them the order and so they have no
responsibility to assume.
Charles Rickman is dead and burled.
The mere fact that the deceased haÂ«
passed to the great beyond would only
Interest hla immediate relatives and
friends were it not for the fact that ho
came to the notice^of the public when
he applied for and was granted letters
of administration upon the estate of
the late Palagla Maria Kryzyanowski,
widow of General Kryzyanawski
As quickly as the fact could be. trans
mitted over the , telephone that Rick
man was dead. Public Administrator
Hynes got busy and the result was an
application for letters of administra
tion.
The application sets forth that Rlck
>man has been recognized by. the court
as the executor of the will of Palagia
Maria Kryzyanowski, but that a final
settlement of the estate has never been
made, consequently the. Public Admin
istrator is the proper person to have
charge of the property of the deceased
testatrix.
At the time the will was probated
a contest was entered by Maria Night
engale, who claimed she was the
daughter of Palagia Maria Kryzyan
ouskl. Before the matter could be
brought to an issue to .determine the
right of Maria Nightengale to the es
tate, a compromise was reached where
by she secured $10,000 and surrendered
her rights to any further share in the
estate. Rickman was granted the let
ters as executor and is said to have
paid over the money In the matter of
compromise. Now that Rickman is
dead, the Public Administrator pro
poses to take charge of his estate and
inquire what has become of the origin
al amount of $30,000.
Nagle & Nagle have represented the
daughter of Mrs. Kryzyanowski. It is
claimed that In their official positions
as representatives of the, contestant
that they secured a compromise of the
contest on the basis of $5000 for their
services when the total amount to be
granted the daughter was but $10,000.
That action led to the removal of Rick
man as executor and the subsequent
appointment of the Public Adminis
trator. Now the main proposition Is
to discover how an estate estimated at
$30,000 a few months ago could dwindle
to about $13,000.
It is claimed by the Public Admin
istrator that the case is one worthy of
investigation and further contended
that thorough sifting of all the acts
will show what was qriginally claimed
â fraud.
Under the will Rickman was the sole
legatee. The compromise effected on
behalf of Maria Nightengale precludes
any possibility of her securing any
further share in the estate, but in or
der to stop the probing of prior events
and the exposure of facts relative to
the shrinkage of the estate, her name
may be used In an application for let
ters of administration, as she contends
blood kin. Under the law the Public
Administrator would be eighth on the
list of those the court could re
cognize in acts of administration. On
the other hand, Rickman was willed
the bulk and, in fact, all of the prop
erty, hence his h^rs can claim his In
terest although he never completed his
report as executor
No time has been set for hearing.

Mayor SchmlU Definitely Announces
That He Has Selected Flre Com
missioner for Position. *
Mayor Schmitz announced yester
day that he had decided upon the ap
pointment of Frank Maestretti- as
Commissioner of Public Works to suc
ceed T. P. Woodward, who was pro
moted to be City Engineer. Publicity
has already been given In these col
umns that Maestretti .- would secure
the plum, and the Mayor's action sim
ply confirms the previous announce
ment.
Mayor Schmitz stated that he had
not as yet made up his mind as to the
successor of Maestretti, who will,re
sign from the Fire Commission to ac
cept . his new appointment. John
Daughney is a strong candidate for
the place, but may have to give way
to one of several others who are also
aspirants. The Mayor was reticent
regarding the names of the candidates
and says he will not make them
known until he has made his final se

Percy V. Lone Defines How Rel
atives of Deceased Firemen May
Obtain Relief.
. An opinion of considerable interest
to the members of the Flre Depart
ment waa rendered yesterday by City
Attorney Long In response ~ to 'the re
quest of the Board of Fire Pension
Fund Commissioners' as to the. right
of Mrs. Phoebe F. Hogan, widow of
Joseph Hogan, to a pension under the
provisions of the charter. Hogan died
of pulmonary tuberculosis on March
14, 1904. -
In his opinion Long holds that in
order that the relatives of a deceased
member of the Fire Department may
obtain a pension it would be necessary
that the deceased member meet with
a violent death, either while in the
immediate performance of his duty
or from an injury received while in
the performance of his duty.
Long advises that the claim of Mrs.
Hogan be denied, because Hogan was
not killed w.hlle performing his duty,
nor was. his death the result of In
juries received.
CITY ATTORXEY TELLS
STATUS OF A PEXSION
XAMES MAESTRETTI AS
MEMBER OP WORKS BOARD
Font LAns Surrendered.
Fong Ling, president of a Chinese
long, who turned State's evidence at
the trial of Nguen Lun. charged with
the murder of Tom Yick of the Chi
nese Educational Society in Ross alley
on May 8, 1903, was surrendered by
his bondsmen yesterday, as it was said
that his life was in danger. Besides
.Nguen Lun, eight other presidents of
tongs were indicted for the murder
and all are out on bonds except Quon
Quock Wah, who has been tried and
convicted. Several witnesses testified
for the defense at Nguen Lun's trial
before a Jury in Judge Lawlor's court
yesterday.
The cause of Fong Ling's surrender
" was claimed to be on account of a re
vard of $3000 having been offered for
his life and ?600 for the silence of
Tom TIa Fong, who was also a wit
ness in the case. Officers of the See
Yup Company claim that such stories
are being circulated in Chinatown in
?order to injure the company and that
j.here is not one word of truth In the
statements. They further state that
if any reward has been offered for the
death of either- man the company will
repudiate it and would like to know
who has circulated such a report.
These immediately took flre, and be
tween the. two a mighty blaze went
up, reaching fully 100 feet into the air.
In the midst of all this the cans and
drums that had been hurled up by the
explosion, burst while they were in the
air and then took flre, giving the ap
pearance of a lot of enormous sky
rockets.
The flames burnt the hawsers and
the little schooner slowly drifted away
from her dock, a seething mass of
flames and emitting enormous volumes
of black smoke. In the meantime the
fire engines arrived upon the dock and,
with the assistance of the flre boat
Governor Markham. after a fierce
fight, succeeded in conquering the
flames. The dock was badly damaged.
The five men that were blown into the
water -struck out in all directions and
were rescued by parties in the vicin
ity. - .
WAS SEVERELY IXJURED.
Joseph Manne. who was in the hold
at the time of the explosion, -was the
most seriously injured. He was able
to swim a distance of 400 feet, how
ever, and was then dragged out of the
water and taken to the Potrero Emer
gency Hospital, where Dr. W. E. Buell
dressed his wounds and from there he
was sent out to the Marine Hospital
The -â blazing schooner was now
drifting with the ebb tide toward
Goat Island. Directly in her path lay
the American bark Carrolton. From
every appearance this mass of blaz
ing flames was about to sweep down
on the bark, but by a most fortunate
occurrence of ebbing tide combined
with a light breeze she drifted past
the anchored bark. The flames -at this
time were fully 100 feet high^ She
kept on drifting until she landed di
rectly in the pathway of the Oakland
steamers and here for a time she
practically came to an anchorage
within about a quarter of a mile of
Goat Island. The tug Governor Mark
ham came alongside and commenced
pouring volumes of water into her.
The deluge kept up for two hours,
but made no appreciable effect. About
11 o'clock, however, the flames com
menced to be subdued, and the masts
fell overboard with a terrible crash.
The Markham then made fast to the
burning hulk and towed her out of
the path of the steamers. Together
they drifted down nearly to Angel
Island, the Markham still pouring tons
of water over her.
Captain Felsher could give no ac
count of how the flre took place. Jo-
BURNING SCHOONER FANNIE
ADEL.K SHORTLY AFTER THE
EXPLOSION. AND HER MASTER.
An explosion of the gases of an In
flammable cargo yesterday morning
rent asunder the docks of the three
masted schooner Fannie Adele, blew
five sailor men into the air and start
ed a blaze ashore which" for awhile
threatened to wiDe out the wharf ana
storehouse of the Arctic Oil Works.
The flames freed the blazing schooner
from the whaVf and the tide carried
her, a veritable fire ship floating in a
sea of seething' flame, from far Â«p
Mission Bay, where the explosion oc
curred, almost to Sausalito. Before
reaching the crowded yacht anchorage
of the seaside village the turning tide
checked the progress of the blazing
Fannie and the incoming current car
ried her, still burning fiercely and sur
rounded as at first by a lake of flam
ing oil. back to the starting place and
beyond for several miles.
That nobody was killed in the explo
sion is hard to understand, but even
more wonderful was the weird cruise
that followed. Propelled by the tide
and steered by her own sweet will,
the Fannie careened out into the har
bor, a menace to whatever she might
touch. By some strange freak of
chance, this floating, fire boit thread
ed its way through a maze of vessels,
threatening all but harming none. In
the schooner's hold the supply of food
for the flames seemed Inexhaustible,
for at 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon
she was burning as fiercely as at 3
o'clock in the morning, half an hour
after the fire took hold.
"She's sinking," said a watcher,
shortly after noon.
She was only fooling the spectators,
however, and had she trailed an as
bestos log line to a flre-proof indi
cator, the dial some hours later would
have shown several knots to the Fan
nle's credit.
AT SLERCY OF THE WAVES.
There was nothing stately about the
; derelict's progress. Â» Now down by the
head, as if ready for a dive to the
cool depths, she would hesitate, shud
der, brace herself and return to an
even keel. Her bow would raise oc
casionally, but only for a minute, and
as long as there was anything to burn
the Fannie Adele blazed.
When the explosion occurred thÂ«
little schooner was lying at the end of
the wharf of the Arctic Oil Company
and her cargo consisted of Illuminat
ing and lubricating oils, a large por
tion of which was gasoline. It was
contained in enormous iron tanks,
huge iron barrels and tin cases. The
vessel was almost ready for sea and
waB to have sailed to-day for Nome.
Captain John Felsher left his ship yes
terday morning a little after 7. o'clock
and about 7:30 she blew up and im
mediately took fire. The explosion tore
the deck from its fastenings, and deck,
men and barrels were hurled In every
direction. Some of the barrels were
thrown as far as 400 feet. At the same
instant she took fire and was ablaze
from stem- to stern.
On the dock alongside of which she
was moored were 200 cases of kerosener.
Plans are being perfected !n this
t'ity for the consolidation of the Inter
ests of the Western Pacific Railway, of
vv'nich W. J. Bartnett is the prominent
factor, and the Butte and Plumas
Railroad and the Indian Valley road,
represented by H. H. Yard. From a
reliable source it has been learned
that Bartnett Is to be superseded by
Yard Jn the direct management of the
three enterprises. Several months ago
the announcement was made In The
Call that Yard and Bartnett had
abandoned all rivalry In their at
tempts to survey a road along the
Feather River and that the Western
Pacific Company would eventually
take' over the route surveyed by the
Yard crews. A few days ago Attor
rey Bartnett admitted in Xew York
that the two roads now hold a com
mon interest in the Sacramento Val
ley. It has since been developed that
Yard and Bartnett, who for a num
ber of months apparently were fight
ing each other, were in reality work
ing for the Gould interests.
FKEDOXIA PASS CIIOSEX.
Yard began operation in the Sac
ramento Valley seven months in ad
vance of the Bartneit forces and per
fected his survey up the Feather Riv
er and out on to the P.iff Meadows be
fore Bartnett had got fairly under
way with his work in this State.
About 120 miles of route surveyed by
Yard from Oroville north to the
Meadows have since been made part
of the general route of the Western
Pacific. Meanwhile the work of the
separate enterprises was being di
rected quietly by E. J. Yard, chief en
gineer of the Denver and Rio Grande
Railroad, who is a cousin of H. H.
Yard, and the first work approved
was that perfected for the Butte and
Plumas and the Indian Valley roads.
Fince then the engineering chiefs of
the transcontinental project have de
cided to abandon the idea of securing
an exit from California by way of
Beckwith Pass, but will take a route
through the Sierra by way of Fre
donia Pass in Lassen County. This de
cision was arrived at only a few days
ago.
PLAN* BIG TCXXEL.
It is the plan of the promoters of
the new road to tunnel under the pass
to a distance of about 2000 feet, by
which means they will effect a gTeat
saving: in grade and distance. It was
also learned yesterday that construc
tion operations along the route will
begin inside of three months. Im
portant changes have yet to be made
in the survey of the route through
Nevada, but in the meantime it is the
intention to start grading crews at
work on this end of the line and to
undertake some of the tunneling. E.
J. Yard is working directly for the
GouldB. a fact which the engineers of
both the Western Pacific and the
Butte and Plumas roads, who were
long kept in ignorance as to who was
really behind the undertakings, Jiave
lately learned. Chief Engineer Yard
will continue to give general direc
tion, while H. H. Yard, at this end.
will proceed to direct the construction
operations. Bartnett's future respon
sibilities will be mainly in connection
with the legal and financial ends of
the transcontinental project.

handicap think they have a grievance.
They say that if the colt had got off
well era his feet at the start he could
not have lost. It may be that, as Odom
said after the race, there were too
many fast horses in the race to give
him a chance. Certainly the son of
Kingston ran a great race, when his
hopeless position in the first three fur
longs is taken into account.
It was the third of the Serial handi
caps, and as Hurst Park had won the
two which preceded it, many hoped to
see him win the third. But he had won
his previous race by only a head from
Lux Casta, which, except for running
anything but a straight course on that
occasion, might have won. Hurst Park
again finished in front of Lux Casta,
but Savable, Rosetint and Red Knight
all finished in front of Hurst Park. The
time of the Van Cortlandt handicap,
1:27 3-5, while good, by no means
marks a superexcellent performance.
At one stage of the contest three racers
were fighting It out, Damon next the
rail, Rosetint in the center and Sav
able on the outside. The last named
racer, which won the Futurity in 1902,
won by a head from Rosetint, upon
which Fuller, just back from Chicago,
rode an excellent race, putting much
more vigor into his work than be has
of late. The value of the Van Cort
landt handicap to the winner was
$2130. Summary:

After three years' absence Julia
Blanc reappeared last night at th?
Central Theater and made a hit in "A
Great Temptation." an ante-bellum
drama of the South. She made the
role of a typical colored maid extreme
ly entertaining. Cheers and heaps of
floral tributes greeted her and through
out the performance she received un
mistakable expressions of good will
from all parts of the big playhouse.
Herschel Mayall was well fitted as a
heroic reformed gambler, and Miss
Lawton did very well as the heroine,
an ingenuous Southern girl. Messrs,
Shumer, Nickolls, Howell. Booth and
Montgomery were conspicuous In the
cast, and Edna Ellsmere was particu
larly good as a desperate victim of
man's duplicity and her own weakness.
The staging of the play was elabo
rately realistic, the effective scenes in
cluding a steamboat on the Mississippi,
sunrise on a plantation, moonlight in a
ruined mill and the spectacle of burn
ing charcoal kilns at night. Though
most of the situations were interrse,
not to say strained, they kept the in
terest of the audience constantly taxed
â and that is the kind of situations
that the Central management strives
to produce.

NEW YORK. May 23.â By slow de
grees and much to the astonishment
of surgeons, Oscar Coller, 20 years old,
is recovering In Harlem Hospital from
a pistol wound which the surgeons
were sure would cause death. In an
attempt to end his life. on May 11, be
cause his sweetheart Jilted him, Coller
fired five shots into his body. One of
the bullets penetrated his lift lung and
grazed the wall of the heart. In a
dying condition, the man was hast
ened to the hospital in an ambulance.
Coller aprjeared to be sinking so rap
idly, that it was not believed he would
live long enough for a surgeon to ex
amine him. \
As not one patient in a thousand, Dh
Manley sayB, recovers from a wound
of this kind, he was inclined to give
Coller up. to expectations,
Coller began to mend. So remarkable
was the case that Harlem physicians,
when they learned of it, visited the
hospital to examine the prodigy. At
first his improvement was hardlv no
ticeable, but gradually he grew strong
er,, until now Dr. Manley says that his
recovery is assured.
"I never heard of a similar case,"
said Dr. Manley. "As a general rule
a patient whose lung has beerT pierced
so close to the heart dies. But this
man also injured his heart, making a
combination which ordinarily would
have caused the death of an average
person."
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Sydney Rosenfeld's sparkling three
act comedy, "A Possible Case," shows
the Alcazar company in its best light
and draws upon the full strength of
that excellent aggregation. It is the
story of a ladyâ young and handsomeâ
who has three husbandsâ all alive, but
two of whom she had believed to be
dead. Her third (Otto Brinckerhoff)
has a former wife, also believed to be
dead, but who returns simultaneously
witlj the two husbands of the aforesaid
lrdy, and thafs where the fun gets
complicated. The climax comes in the
second act and things are unraveled in
the third. George Osbourne is the vil
lain. Senor Mendoza and his make-up
as the sly Mexican is as good as that
of his Piute Indian which made him
famous twenty-five years ago. Adele
Block personates Violet Mendoza with
her accustomed skill and charm. Ethel
Sorero, the returning wife of the un
happy Brinckerhoff (John B. Maher) Is
in the capable hands of Juliet Crosby,
who ever has been and ever will be a
favorite at the Alcazar. Mr. Durkin
has a light role of frequent appear
ances and is always welcomed for his
frank and unassuming personality.
Frances Starr and Harry Hilliard, the
juveniles of the comedy, are pleasing
figures and contributed much to the
success of the presentation. Messrs.
Conriess, Mason and Walter B'lasco
were as usual up to the mark. Marie
Howe, always bright and clever in her
line, received a fair share of the ap
plause last night.

The senior class, which graduated a

Xirit. and its creditors, as well as the
university authorities, are undecided as

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, May 23.
â Thomas Andrew Storev, director of
the Encina Gymnasiurh, left this after
noon* for an extended Eastern trip,
ending- at â¢Â¦ Harvard University, where
he will spend a year in study and in
vestigation. Since 1902, when Dr.
Storey received the Ph. D. degree from
Stafford for original investigations
embodied in his masterly thesis, "Some
Studies in Voluntary Muscular Con
traction," the gvmnasium instructor
has been carrying on advanced work
in physiology in the Stanford labora
tories for his M. D. degree. His special
hobby has been, as before, muscular
contractions, and the work he has done
has received much praise from inves
tigators all over the United States.
The work next year in the gymna
sium will be directed by Holbert "W.
Chappel, '01, this year's assistant.
Storey will return at the beginning of
.the university year in 1905 to open the
mammoth new Stanford Gymnasium,
now in the course of building. During
his Eastern visit he will become fa
miliar with similar institutions at Har
vard, Princeton, Yale, and especially at
Columbia. The wrestling, boxing and
fencing, now directed by student as
sistants, win then be controlled by
hired instructors. It is said that Frank
W. Erne, the ex-champion lightweight,
is considering an offer to leave his po
sition at Columbia and come to Stan
ford.

CHICAGO, May 23. â Bearish crop advices
from the Northwest. In addition to liberal ship
ments from Russia, caused weakness In wheat
to-day. Compared with Saturday's final fig
ures July wheat shows a loss of %c. Corn
U unchanged. Oats are a shade lower. Pro
visions are up 2%c to 12%c.
For a brief period at the start the wheat
market had a firm undertone. The firmness
was due mainly to extremely small local re
ceipts, only two cars being inspected here to
day. Initial sales of July were unchanged to
%e higher at S7%c to l*8Vie. Ideal weather
conditions and surprisingly heavy shipments
from Rutsla exerted Influence, however, before
the session had made much progress, and on
ecattered selling the market became easier.
Great improvement .was claimed in the con
dition of the winter crop. One report from
Kansas City was especially optimistic, the as
sertion being made that threshing will begin
In Kansas within thirty days. Bearish crop
advices from the Northwest had much to do
with the Increased depression pervading the

Northern Business.
Bv the end of the firet hour there was an
abrupt halt In the rising movement of prices
and a eudden relapse into the recent eeml
stHgnatioti. Durir.g the first hour IWUiOO
ehare* chsjiged hands. During the second
hour the aggregate dealings reached only 20.00J
shares. The dazed speculative spirit was due
to the realization of some heavy requirements
stiil ahead of the money market which might
have necessitated last week's loÂ»n contraction
and also the background of a general business
contraction going on in the country and newly
confirmed by the usual weekly summaries of
conditions. Wihle the money market enjoyed
! the benefit of the $0,000,000 disbursement to.
| the credit of thfc Panama republic made by
1 the sub-treasury last week, it was recollected
j that the call of th- treasury for Government
I dÂ«-jK**ita falling due en May 25 will call for
i the furrer.tier of rather more than that amount
j 1 > tha banks. The olfering of the Cuban lean
. in this market is also to be taken account Of
; in the money market outlook.
Prices made practically no progress after the
Â¦ f.m hour, duri::g which more than half of
1 the Uay'b total bufintcs was done. In the
! fir.al tieal'.ngs prices s-xgged off on offerings
; by disappointed holders and the closing was
' tany and dull.
Bonds were steady. Total sales, $1,670,000.

Collins threatens to have Chief Witt

cited for contempt for arresting eight
inmates of the place on Saturday
night.
.TVhen .the contempt proceedings
against Chief Wittman and Police
Commissioner Hutton for an alleged
violation 1 of the injunction restrain
ing the police from interfering with
the restaurant business of Jean Pon
at 1129 Dupont street were called be
fore Judge Cook yesterday afternoon
he said he would sustain the de
murrers of the respondents and purge
them of contempt. Â¦ He said that if
the attempt had been carried out
there would have been no question
that the injunction had been violated.
But there had been nothing more done
than to make preparations for the
act. It was true that it was alleged
in the affidavit of the petitioner that
the warrants had been obtained mere
ly as a subterfuge to gain an entrance
to the premises, and if that had been
done it would have been a violation
of the injunction, but there was no
proof. If the warrants had been given
to the Chief and by him to a subordi
nate to serve that would have been an
overt act. Collins- asked that the or
der restraining the police from using
the warrants be kept in force, and ho
also asked leave to file, an amended
affidavit.
The Judge said that the restraining
order would stand and the respondents
could file an answer. They filed an
answer denying the allegations in the
affidavit.' ~',"

ASK BIG* DAMAGES.â Walter and Anaa
Murray have sued the San Francisco Oas and
Electric Company fop $10,000 damages and $750
for medical attendance ) for injuries received
by their minor child, who was burned by a
live wire belonging: to defendant.
The Judge overruled the first two
points made by McGowan and said he
would examine the authorities sub
mitted on the third point, lie had in
structed the jury not to consider any
statements of counsel not borne out by
the evidence, but if an error had been
committed it would be as well to cor
rect it instead of taking the case be
fore the Supreme Court. He said he
would render his decision on June 1.
Attorney. McGowan argued that the
evidence should have been confined to
the testimony as to the commission
of the crime alleged and should not
have embraced evidence as to the re
lations that existed between the de
fendant and John P. Dunning. The sec
ond point was that the District Attor
ney errp<l in reading to witnesses the
testimony given at the former trial.
The third pqint was that the District
Attorney erred in bringing matters not
in evidence before the jury, referring
to the Dreyfus case.
When the Judge asked her if there
was any legal cause why sentence
should not be pronounced upon her,
Attorney McGowan said he had a mo
tion to make for a new trial on the
following grounds: That the trial was
had in the absence of the defendant;
that the court misdirected the jury in
matters of law; that the court erred
in decision of questions of law aris
ing during the course of the trial; that
the verdict was contrary to law; that
the verdict was' contrary to the evi
dence, and is against and not sup
ported by the evidence;. that new evi
dence has been discovered material to
the defendant, and which she could
not with reasonable diligence have
discovered and produced upon the
trial.
Mrs. Cordelia Botkin, convicted by
a Jury in Judge Cook's court on April
7 for the murder of Mrs. Elizabeth
Dunning by sending her a box of
poisoned candy to Dover, Del., in Au
gust, 1898, appeared before the Judge
yesterday afternoon for sentence. A
motion for a new trial was made by
Attorney Frank McGowan and the
Judge reserved his decision till June 1.
The defendant was modestly attired
in black, and when the Judge ordered
her to rise for sentence she stood with
her head slightly bent and her hands
crossed. /

; General Salqmon, stated at the end of
the trial that he knew of no ground
upon which an appeal could be taken
except some slight admissions of tes
timony while Soeder waa on the stand.
He said that Judge Cook's charge to
the Jury was absolutely fair and waa
similar to. other charges in famous
murder trials that had been sustained
by the Supreme Court of this State.
While waiting for the verdict Soeder
was taken to the City Pri3on. When
Deputy Sheriffs Brophy and Meinert
went to bring him to the courtroom he
asked one of them what he thought
the verdict waa.
"Imprisonment for life," said Brophy.
. "Forget it." said Soeder; "that's only
your opinion."
Thereafter he spoke no word and
gave no sign when the death penalty
was announced. Even to some of his
acquaintances he only nodded, and for
the first time during the trial his eye3
were steady. When he arrived at the
County Jail he was put in a cell with
a man named West, accused of burg
lary, for fear that suicide was contem
plated. He will be guarded until his
sentence on May 31.
The jury. took two ballots, the first
resulting in eleven for conviction and
one for acquittal. After a short discus
sion another ballot was taken and a
unanimous verdict was given for mur
der in the first degree, "without recom
mendation, which means the death pen
alty. Sixteen minutes were spent in the
actual work of the jury, but they were
absent from the courtroom twenty
three minutes.
The morning session was entirely
taken up by the vigorous argument of
District Attorney Byington, who made
a telling discourse against the defend
ant, dwelling principally upon the mo
tive for the crime. ,
In Judge Cook's court. yesterday Leon
Soeder was found guilty of the murder
of his brother-in-law, Joseph Blaise.
.The Jurors were convinced that ths
defendant had lured his relative from
an obscure town In Germany and after
securing certain insurance policies on
Blaise's life had foully silt his throat
below a dark wall on Taylor street on
the night of January 10.
It was a long night, cold and wet.
The yachtsmen do not know where
they drifted, but were looking out for
the Farallones yesterday morning
when daylight showed them Angel Is
land and the approaching General Mc-
Dowell.
The Olympic left So-utn San Fran
cisco with fausalito as her .destina
tion. Lack of wind made progress
slow and late Sunday afternoon the
yacht was off Angel Island, her sails
flapping and all hands whistling for
wind. The wind came â¢ with a swoop.
The yacht ducked to the breeze and
somebody started to sing "A Life on
the Ocean Wave" when snap went a
wire stay, crash went the mast and
the Olympic was buried in canvas^
The fog swept in shortly after and
in mist and darkness the Olympic
drifted until yesterday morning, when
the General McDowell took her in
tow.
The yachting party was made up as
follows: Misses Maud and Elsie Fever,
Misses Mary and Rose Hicks, Miss
Anne Carroll, J. McAdam, J. Benken,
C. Starr, F. Gaffney, M. Watkin and
H. Benken.
The sloop yacht Olympic, which left
South San Francisco at 11:30 a, m.
Sunday, was picked up yesterday by
the Government steamer General Mc-
Dowell off Angel Island. The yacht
was dismasted and the eleven amateur
sailors, of whom five were girls, were
cold, wet and hungry, but happy at
being once more within reach- of a
cable car *

The amended ordinance imposing a
licenpe of $2 a quarter on riding acad
emies doing a business of $500 a
month, and $4 a quarter on those whose
receipts exceed jpOO a month was re
fern d to the License Committee.
Brandenstein explained that the pres
ent license of $20 is exorbitant, as some
of the riding academies are struggling
for existence.
The following measures were finally
passed :

$21 a quarter when sales amount to
less than $15,000 and at 341 when the
sales are more than $15,000. as already

After consultation with her attor
ney, a French woman accused of va
grancy declared that her name was
Jane Doe and nothing else, and Judge
Cabaniss eloquently expressed the
pleasure conveyed to him by meeting
the original bearer of that cognomen.
"So many borrowers of your name,
Miss Doe â or shall I address you as
Mrs. Doe? â have appeared here that
I began to think it waa a nomencla
tural myth."
Then he continued the case against
the woman.
Gertie Sawyer told Judge Mogan
that she was one of the esteemed at
taches of the Diana dance hall. .
"And an appropriate title It seems;
Miss .Sawyer," remarked the Judge,
"when one remembers that Diana was
goddess of the chase."
One of the female vagrantB before
Judge Cabaniss stated that she was
employed in the Rainbow saloon and
dance hall. "So termed, I suppose,"
said his Honor, "because the inmates
of the establishment are mora prolific
of promise than of fulfillment."

William White, a gondolier at the
Chutes, denied that he maliciously at
tacked C. J. Klotz, admiral of the flo
tilla that shoots the aquatic toboggan.
'I didn't mean to hurt him in no
way, ehape or manner," Mr. White
swore; and so pleased was he 'vith the
euphony of the plea that he repeated
it word for word at least half a dozen
times ere his testimony was finished.
He will probably be pronounced Kuilty

Klotz exhibited a swollen jaw and mu

fistic prowess

James N. Crowell (colored) was cuf

on the scene Mr. Crowell had doffed
his coat and was "squaring up" at
Mr. Cosgrove.

Mr. Cosgrove was dismissed never

Patrolmen Joy and Nelson made a
sweeping round-up of female vagrants
on the Barbary Coast last Saturday
night, and no less than fifteen petti
opated defendants were scooped in and
equally distributed among the three
Police courts. In each case the defense
was that the defendant was not a
vagrant, inasmuch as she was employ
ed in n dance- hall, and in Mogan's
tribunal the question arose whether
dancing and drinking constitute hon
est employment. His Honor took the
negative and sustained it by impos
ing a J5 fine on each of the women al
lotted to his department. Nor did the
women in the other courts fare any
better.

The Kuhring case entered in aaperlty
and departed to the accompaniment oÂ£
Mendelssohn's "Wedding March,"
hummed by Tenor Dick Jose, who is
devoting his vacation to the imbibing
of criminal Jurisprudence in Depart
ment No. 1. It was the numerical
strength of the Kuhrings and their
tangled inter-relationship that made
the proceedings so confusing. Among
those present were Mrs. Lizzie Kuhring
and Miss Bertha Kuhring. defendants
on a charge of disturbing the peace;
Mrs. Annie Kuhring, Carl Kuhring,
Gus Kuhring and Mrs. Barbara Kuhr
ing. It was explained that Mrs. Lizzie
lives with her husband, Carl, her moth
er-in-law, Mrs. Annie, and her father
in-law, Gus, at 65 Prospect avenue. At
another number on the same thorough
fare reside Miss Bertha, 16 years of
age, and her mother, Mrs. Barbara,
Â¦who was the wife of Gus until he got
a divorce and married Annie. Mrs.
Lizzie, with her baby in her arms, went
to visit, Mrs. Annie last Sunday after
noon, despite her dread of meeting Miss
Bertha, who had threatened to "do"
her. Sure enough, she met Bertha at
Annie's door, and Bertha immediately
attacked her. Mrs. Barbara aided Miss
Bertha in the assault, and when Mrs.
Lizzie struck Mrs. Barbara in self-de
fense Miss Bertha hurled a brick at
Mrs. Lizzie, the missile sfriking Mrs.
Lizzie. Then the police chippsd in and
arrested Mrs. Lizzie and Miss Bertha
for disturbing the peace.
Incidental to the hearing it developed
that the cause of Miss Bertha's antago
nism to Mrs. Lizzie was the latter
lady's spreading of a report derogatory
to Miss Bertha's character, and then
came the disclosure that the soonc-r
Miss Bertha became a bride the better
it would be for her future welfare. His
Honor, whom the preceding testimony
had evidently stumped, grasped at the
unexpected revelation as a drowning
man clutches a straw and utilized it so
deftly as to emerge from the muddle
with flying colors. The masculine cause
of Miss Bertha's misfortune, a 20-year
old Willie Hampton, was among the
spectators in court, and in a trice the
Judge had him before the bar. The boy
agreed to marry the girl at any time
and place the court might propose, and
12 o'clock to-day and the Judge's cham
bers were immediately designated.
As soon as the wedding ceremony is
performed the case against the bride
will be dismissed and her numerous
relatives advised to scatter themselves
as widely as possible over the city, in
stead of sojourning in enmity on Pros
pect avenue
Of the many experienced assimilators
of testimony who heard the various
tales told by witnesses in the Kuhring
case not one could mold them Into
anything like a coherent narrative.
Judge Mogan's countenance plainly
confessed inability to fully compre
hend, Prosecuting Attorney Greeley did
not attempt elucidation, Bailiff Hickey
drank deeply from the Judge's water
jug and clung to the bench for support,
Clerk Grey's mentality went down and
out early in the game and the assem
bled legal lights were a living picture
of human bewilderment.
In the case of Mrs. Anna Speak
man, charged with attempting to mur
der Mrs. Clara Lefevre by cutting her
with a carving knife, it was reported
to Judpre Mogan that the defendant
was out of town, but will appear thi3
morning. and attempt to show cause
why her bail of $100 should not be in
creased. It was also reported that
Mrs. Lefevre's Condition had not un
dergone a change for the worse since
Saturday morning, when Dr. Amiel
certified that fatality was possible.
"Yellow" Kennedy case was on hear
ing before Judge Cabaniss, and some
Ptift punches had been exchanged by
the combatants before the bailiffs
separated them. Newburg's manner
angered Hanley, who proposed an ad
journment to "have it out." The pro
posal was declined and then Hanley
taxed Newburg with cowardice and
muttered something about "Hebrew
ancestry." in an instant Newburg re
taliated with a blow and honors were
pretty evenly divided in the ensuing
"scrap." Judge Cabaniss severely
reprimanded the attorneys for allow
ing their pugnacity to disturb the de
corum of the court and the incident
closed. i
Assistant District Attorney Hanley
Â»nd Attorney Nevrburg engaged in
fistic combat while the interminable
â¢which evidence of sex had been re
moved. The case was continued.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Arthur Fry, 17 years of age, de
manded 1 money from his Â¦ widowed
mother and then cursed her because
she refused to comply with his de
mand. In response to Judge Mogan's
inquiry as to whether he had ever been
aijrested before the defendant said
that once he had been run in for vio
lating the 8 o'clock "audience." He
will be sentenced for vagrancy.
