RENO, Oct. 3.â Sam P. Davis. State
Controller of Nevada and ex-officio In
surance Commissioner of the State. to-
Gay revoked the license of ! the New
York Life Insurance Company, thereby
prohibiting that company from trans
acting further business in the State of
Nevada. This will not annul the pol
icies of the company, which have al
ready been issued in the State, but pro
hibits any more policies from being is
fcucd.
The record of the business done in
this State by the New York Life
reaches an enormous figure, as shown
by the report of the Controller. Dur
ing last year the company Issued 1173
policies to citizens in the State, the
policies amounting to more than $3,
000,000. The amount pcid in to the
company by the policy holders is given
a* $103,457.
The company has offices in . Reno,

Verdi and Golconda, and agents in all
the sjiialler towns of tfte" State.
The action of the Controller, was
taken after due investigation of the af
fairs Â«f the company.. In a letter re
ceived by him from President McCall
it was acknowledged that the company
had donated money for the campaign
fund used in the last general election.
It was the opinion of the Controller
that, in justice to the citizens of the
State and in order to prevent the fur
ther collection of money by the com
pany to be used for corrupt and il
legal purposes, the only alternative left
was to prohibit the transaction of any
further business by revoking the li
cense. The decision of the Controller is
contained in the following letter to the
president of the New York Life Com
pany:
"John McCalL
"President New York Life.
"Pending an investigation of the cor
rupt management and the fraudulent
exposures of the disposals of the funds
intrusted to your company and so long
as yourself and George Perkins retain
offices of trust in the management of
the New York Life, the license of the
company to do business- in the State of
Nevada is hereby revoked. Upon the
advice of change of management and
satisfactory proof of honest manage
ment the license will be reissued.

SACRAMENTO, Oct. 3.â Governor Par
dee and the State Board s cf Prison Di
rectors have decided to force to a 'legal
issue the ownership of the water that
flows through the canal on the Folsom
prison grounds. To effect this, purpose
gpeedily a conference was held this after
noon in the Governor's office, at which
there ,were present Governor Pardee,
Prison' Directors Wilkins and Felton, At
torney General U. S. Webb, W. M. Good
win, private counsel for the directors, and
Warden Archibald Yell.
After a \u25a0 general consultation it was
agreed tnat the case now pending In the
courts, and which has been hanging fire
for several years, should be pushed ahead
as rapidly as possible" in order that the
mooted question as to the ownership . of
the water may be settled once and for aIL
In speaking of ..the. result of .the private
conference one of those present said:. .
"It is understood the Btate- is- to have
the '\u25a0\u25a0. exclusive use: of the first. 7:33
feetf of fall, and." after the - State
Is done with the water It is to -flow down
the canal and be used by the ,i-"olsom
Water, Power:-; and -. Electric : Company.
Several years ago- when the, water would
get low .in. the river, the. electric company
started the practice of "closing; the gates
and allowing. the water to back up against
the dam until there, was a sufficient vol
ume for several; hours' run, 'when the
company would again open the gates and
use the water, but. during the time the
gates were so closed, the State was .de
barred from the use of ahy.wate^- at all,
with the result that all of its machinery
came to a standstill.
"When* the 'prison /authorities objected
and opened the gates to allow the water
to flow the electrical company placed " a
padlock' on the gates.' 1 Then " the prison
authorities instructed the . Warden to
break the padlock, and he did so. The
electric company then obtained an in
junction in the courts prohibiting, the
Prison Directors from further interference
with'the gates, -and sinee -that time the
matter has remained dormant in the
courts. '\u25a0 â¢ -
"We have now decided to. insist on the !
case being- heard, and- we will do all that
lies in our power. to push.it to a decision.
At to-day's session \ there was nothing
said about the attempt said to have been
made by Warden' Yell to take possession
of the dam, for nothing of that kind was
ever done. What we want; Is to- know,
our exact standing in the case. Either we
are entitled to use this water or else we
are not. In the meantime .the- prison
grounds are in darkness half the time
because there is no water to generate
electricity, and- the machinery' is still be
cause there is no power to operate it, and
this state of affairs cannot continue." \u25a0
Governor Pardee said to-night in refer
ence to to-day's conference: \u25a0 â¢
- "We have decided to push the issue as
to the ownership of the water, through
the courts as rapidly as It can be done.
What we want' is to know our status in
the matter; and this can only be decided
in the courts. If we are entitled to the
use of this water we want to know it
and we want' to use it..-- â¢ \u25a0 ,
"The State has expended over $500,000 In
constructing this dam, and now it cannot
use its own property. I understand that
the electric company is anxious \u25a0. to com
promise the matter, and' it was to a cer
tain extent the ; purpose of the meeting
this afternoon to decide If such a proposi
tion should be considered.
"Eventually we agreed to accept no
compromise at all, but to carry the mat
ter through the courts as rapidly as pos
sible in order to ascertain' our exact
status in the matter. We need power -to
generate lights for the prison grounds at
night, as during the Â» low stage \u25a0of the
American River when the* gates .have
been chut we have. been obliged to use lo
comotive headlights to ; illuminate the
grounds at night, and have at times been
obliged to shut down the power-house
and our machinery altogether. For this
reason we want a legal decision, and we
want it as soon as we can get it."

Mrs. Se/den Wright
Makes Address
of Welcome.
"It is difficult to understand how a
body\ of women, animated with the
deepest feelings of patriotic loyalty,
can preserve an allegiance to a dead
Government" â such were the words of
Mrs. Victor Montgomery, president of
the California Division of the United
Daughters of the Confederacy. '
With all due respect to Mrs. Mont
gomery's opinion, it is not difficult to
understand it â not if one knows the
texture of the Southern head and heart.
And never was better chance offered to
know them than now, when several
hundred daughters of Dixie â and a few
sons thrown in â are dwellers In our
city.
Yesterday the real business of the
annual was begun in the
marble room of the Palace, where 16
will convene every morn in sr and even
ing this week, with the social features
sandwiched in between..
Yesterday's early session was pri
marily one of iDeechmakins. Prayer
was" offered by the Bight Rev. Bishop
Nichols. He was followed by Mrs. Sel
den. S. Wright, founder ot,JÂ£*JL. JO. C,
in California, who made a pretty little
speech of welcome. * v *
! It bad been hoped that Mayor Schmltz
would appear â as per programÂ© â -to de
liver over , the oft-given \u25a0 keys of the
city, but he came not. . Neither did the
Governor, who ' pleaded press of busi
ness.
That the delegates from far away
would be amply sure they were wel
come, and thrice welcome, Mrs. Alfred
Hunter Voorhles gave a clever address, â¢
representing the "hostess chapter" â
the Albert Sidney Johnston.
' Then there must needs be a welcome
from the State, and Mrs. Victor Mont
gomery, the State president, discharged
the obligation charmingly; being a
very pretty woman, and with a char
acteristic Southern voice, the talk was
interesting, although the delegates had
by this time got quite used to being;
welcomed.
Mrs. Augustine Smythe, the national
president of the organization, responded
to this potpourri of welcome in pretty.
Southern fashion.
Then followed quite the most inter
esting episode of the convention thus
far â the presentation to the U D. C. of.
a portrait of Its founder. Mrs. C Merri
weather Goodlet
The picture, a well-drawn, tender
likeness of the well-beloved, leader,
stood upon an easel, set In a heavy
gold frame, .with an inscription upon
it telling the story, of "Its origin.
Over the portrait was draped a silk
en Confederate flag, which was raised
at a signal from Mra. Voorhlea by her
two little grandchildren, the \ babes of
I Mrs. Malcolm Henry. In " caressing
fashion the flag was then hung over
the 'frame, to remain several hours In
the marble-room for inspection. UUI- '
mately it Is believed that the picture
will be bung permanently in the Con
federate Memorial Museum in Rich*
mond, Va.
-Many Incident* of human Interest oc
curred during the morning. Including
the enthusiastic honor conferred upon
Mrs. William Prichard. daughter of th*
famous commander, Albert . Sidney
Johnston, and to old Captain M,ay of
the Ninth Alabama Regiment, a
grizzled old fellow, who went to the>
front with 106 man and returned with
six. There was a tear and a cheer for,
him, this old Confederate, whose heart
still thrilled at memory of the Lost
Cause. \u25a0.:- \u25a0
: Luncheonâ which was seemingly tha
most interesting feature of the seasoa
â was served in the maple-room, and a
pretty sight it was. with a troupe ol
pretty maids and young matrons look
ing after the comfort of the city's fal?
guests. Among these "maids of honor**
are Miss Dubois, Miss Dozler, Miss An
drews, Miss Anderson, Miss May Har
vey Foulke^ Miss Barrett. Miss Malsla
Coyle, Mrs. John M. McClure, MUs NeU
rose . Barrett. Miss Evelyn Theobald,
Miss Angela Coyle. Miss Wilson. Mrs.
McGaw. Miss Harter and Miss France*
Soule Campbell.
Luncheon" over, the guests war*
taken to the Cliff, and a beautiful sun
set on the water promised them. The>
sun behaved well, sending out \u0084 his
rarest of amethyst â¢ rays, . inlaid . wlth>
gold, and .the visitors were entranced
at the splendor spread before them.
.Â» The \u25a0 evening session was uneventful.
Mrs. i Smythe addressing, a few words.
of welcome to the newcomers.

TRYING TIME
FOR EMMONS
Accused Legislator Has a
Severe Day Under Fire of
the District " Attorney
TWICE ASKS RECESS
3lade to Go Into the Details
.Concerning Movements on
Night Money Was Passed
SACRAMENTO. Oct. 3.â Ex^Senator
E. J. EmmonS, on trial for bribery, was
to-day subjected to over .four hours of
cross-examination by District Attorney
Seymour. Twice during the day Em
moos asked the court to declare a re
cess and he frequently took occasion to
ry.riark that he was in very bad health.
The District Attorney took Emmons
over every step of the way between the
State House and Sixth street, on the
south side of X, and from Sixth to
Eighth on the opposite side of the
street. This was the course which Em
ir; ons affirms was taken by himself and
Jordan on the evening of Tuesday, Jan
uary 24. the night upon which it is al
leged the money was passed. He re
membered having entered Hanlon's sa
loon and he testified that when he met
Martin Kelly of San Francisco he shook
him by the hand and said: "If other
people are ashamed to shake hands
without you, I am not."
The witness testified that he left the
Senate immediately after making his
statement in response to the affidavit
of Corbin and had gone home. Emmons
added: "I was so ashamed that I
wanted to get away." .'* . -JV
"Why were you ashamed?" was
asked.
"It was a humiliation to be accused
iq that manner," replied the â¢ witness.
"A man can be humiliated by a lie as
\u25a0well as by the truth. My indignation
had been exhausted."
Just before the prosecution concluded
its examination, Seymour asked: "Did
you and Wright promise Harry Bunkers
that you would -give his wife $500 to
tide her over the time he would be in
jaiir' - â¢
"No, sir." /\u25a0
On "^redirect examination Emmons
stated that he had made one offer of
assistance to Bunkers and Eli Wright.
Emmons denied that he had ever
talked with Jordan, Wright and Bunk
ers in his room about disposing of the
marked bills. Jleverting to his meet
ing with Jordan in Emmons' -room on
the night of January 30. the defendant
said Jordan had told him that Jordan's
family would have to be taken care of
and named $2500 as the sum needed,
l^ater Jordan said $2000 would be suf
ficient. Emmons said he told Jordan
lie had never received any boodle, and
that Jordan knew it. Jordan replied,
the \u25a0witness said, that he was in a posi
tion to say that Emmons had received
tjie bribe money. The defendant said
Jordan declared that if Emmons did not
put up the money, the San Francisco
Bulletin, which made the boodle expose,
would.
Seymour then asked Emmons if he had
not stated in an interview with R. E.
Connelly, a reporter for the Sacramento
Union, that Jordan had visited his room
and demanded money for the protection
Of his family, and that he had driven
Jordan from his room and threatened to
shoot him if he took the stand to testify
against him at the meeting of the Senate
investigating committee. Emmons said
he had given Connelly an interview, but
did not recall that he had said he would
shoot Jordan. He repeated a statement
made earlier in his examination that he
would kill Jordan if he did not get out
of his room.
Seymour then examined the witness
closely in an attempt to show that de
spite Emmons* declaration against Jor
dan he had met with Bunkers and Jor
dan in Hiram W. Johnson's office and
there had discussed the law which might
save Jordan. Emmons would not state
positively that he was or was not at
Johnson's office with Bunkers and Jor
dan. He had no recollection of Bunkers
having said at that time that Jordan
must be saved at all risk.
Seymour next asked about, the parting
of Jordan and Emmons. when, it is al
leged, J6rdan slipped the $350 in marked
.greenbacks to him in shaking hands and
saying good-by. Emmons, declared he and
Jordan did not shake hands at parting,
and insisted that nothing was said at that
or any other time about money.
EH Wright was on the witness stand
to-day and contradicted the testimony
of Bunkers In every essential par
ticular.. His examination had not
closed when court adjourned until to
morrow morning.
WILL KEEP 3IOSQUITOES
AWAY FROM PRESIDENT
Every Precaution to Be Tak
en to Protect Roosevelt
in New Orleans.
- WASHINGTON, Oct. 3.â Every precau
tion will be taken to safeguard the Presi
dent on his trip to New Orleans. The
rooms he will occupy there will be
screened to prevent mosquitoes from
gaining entrance. The rooms will be fumi
gated a day -or two before they are oc
cupied by the President and â¢ day, and
night persons wlll.be near the President
to keep away mosquitoes. There may be
some danger of infection by reason, of
persons in first stages of yellow fever, who
conceal the fact so aa to be on the streets
to see the President. These persons will
be watched.
â¢ The Executive's determination to return
to Washington by eea has again revived
the contention that' there Is a constitu
tional or statutory, limitation against the
President's leaving the limits of the
United States. There is; no such pro
lision, but no President has ever left the
domain of the United States and entered
the territory of another country. Every
President from Washington to Roosevelt
has scrupulously observed' the unwritten
law in this regrard. . y
Presidents have, however, gone beyond
the three-mile limit at sea, which is of
course beyond the confines of the country,
as will President Roosevelt on his return
from New Orleans.

SEATTLE, Oct. 3. â The Independent

Outlaw Harry j Tracy killed several offi
cers in a pitched battle three years ago.
bttrtiiut., Oct 3, â Tue one clew to
the bandits w&o last night robbed the.
Great Northern- eastbound overland
train near Ballard upon which- the of
ficers? have to vfork was discovered at
7 o'clock this morning, three miles from
the scene of the hold-up. It was a
horse-" well-jiigh run to death, tied to
a tree and hitched to an open. buggy. 'i
la the buggy were articles of cloth
ing, among them a heavy rain coat,
identified to-day by local passengers
aboard the train as one â¢worn' by one of
last night's robbers.. The tracks of
three men were found clearly im
printed and in the morning bloodhounds
will be put upon the scent by Sheriff
Smith, who will -.follow them with a
large posee. - . ,^t
To-aay. the railroad authorities called
in the Pinkertons and have turned out
the railroad detective force and these,
with Sheriff Smith, believe that the
gang has headed into the heavy, timber
in the northern part of , the county
around Lake Samamish and the head
of Lake Washington. The Great, Nort
hern has offered a reward of $5000 for
the capture of the gang and an addi
tional reward of $500 for every convic
tion secured. \u2666
All day to-day the Sheriff's posse was
kept at work in the near vicinity of the
scene of the hold-up, but late this i
afternoon was 'called in and to-night a
heavy detachment was started for the j
village of Bothell, near the head of
Lake Washington, and to-morrow
morning still another squad of officers
will go to Woodinville, in the same
general locality. _ ,
Two business men of Ballard late to
night gave to Sheriff Smith a descrip
tion that may lead to . the capture of
three of the men implicated in yester
day's affaiit They reported at noon to
day they were stopped on the road near
the scene of the hold-up by three men,
one of medium build and about 40
years of age. wearing a heavy black
beard: the others smooth-faced young
men of from 28 to 30 years. They
asked the way , to the railroad tracks,
but after being directed made their
way into the brush. The man with
the beard wore about his shoulders a
gunnysack. The same sack was found
to-day among the things in the dis
carded rig. three miles from the scene.
The three men were seen again last
evening by the same Ballard residents.
At that time they were sitting on .the
sand at the scene of-the hold-up and
the younger men ran'hurriedly into the
brush when a local train from Everett
to Seattle 'came into sight.
The Great Northern sent out a state
ment to-day from Everett to the effect
mat the total loss by last night's rob
bery was $1365, but there are persistent
rumors afloat to-night that the sum
was vastly in excess of that amount.
The Seattle police force is keeping a
sharp lookout for the highwaymen and
believes they are in the city, as the last
seen of the wagon in which they
escaped was about three miles from
Ballard at 3 o'clock this morning. The
wagon at this, time had no onÂ« in it
and the horse was running.
WOULD CREATE BOER
REPUBLIC IN AFRICA
Nephew of General Dewet
Plots Overthrow of Ger
man Rule.
BERLIN", Oct. 3.â Andrew Dewet,
nephew of the famous Boer, A. Chris
tion Dewet. has been arrested at his
residence in a suburb of Windhoek,
German Southwest Africa, with four
other Boers, accused of plotting the
overthrow of German rule in South
west Africa, to create a Boer republic.
This news, purporting to come, from
an excellent authority, was distributed
to the German press by the Hanseatic
Press Bureau, and is accepted as true
by leading Berlin journals.
Andrew Dewet, who Is' a merchant
of Windhoek, is described as having
Arranged with the rebel natives to
make common cause with them. About
15,000 Boers are said to be In German
Southwest Africa, a j quarter of whom
are organized. Considerable quantities
of arms were seized at Dewet's house.
Although the arrests occurred August
23, nothing was reported by cable to
the newspapers; doubtless on account
of the censorship. ,
Andrew Dewet married a daughter of
a Prussian army officer. ' .\u25a0\u25a0 â¢ .

' There- was "much - joy-, in " the ' Gregoretti
camp last night. The singer has not been
himself since he came here, but last night
came to his own again, -his voice in splen
did trim and himself full to, the brim of
the frolic humor of the big role.- Possibly
. the performance is slightly heavier | than
that of two years ago, has' a shade less
abandon and freedomâ possibly not. It
was not against i a Tetrazzinl, a very
Puck last night, that Gregpretti sang last
time. And the suggestion even is "un
grateful, after the delightfully gay and
joyous performance -of the : barytone. ,It
took only ainote or two ofhis "Largo'al
Factotum" to^ diecover Gregoretti's .re
newed vocal trim: He sang it, danced it,
â¢acted it to perfection, and great was the
applause thereof. : His "ensembles with Al
maviva; with Rosiria, were all most sym
pathetically sung, .the rich, smooth note
coming most gratefully.
Tetrazzini, if she lo.st her voice, could j
walk round to the Columbia any day j
right Into" comedyâ if she' does not prefer
farce. Her Rosina was -: simply : bubbling j
over with fun from beginning toy end.
She seemed glad, to get off the grand
opera stiltsâ as glad as we were to have
her. There was not the slightest hesi-j
tation In sacrificing the voice to the fun, j
.yet she was in lovely voice,' though tried j
a little In \u25a0. the "mu,sic : lesson".;: by the

said:
Notwithstanding the avÂ«rage rate paid by
the people of the United States Is only about
40 par cent of that of Russia, we have a great
many people who are preaching . a new doc
trine,'-and that ts the regulation of railway
rates by Federal authority. It has been an
nounced 'In an official manner that there ha*
been no reduction of rates In the United Statej
for twenty-five years;, that tariffs have .been
reduced: atâ tlme^.but that whenever, a tariff
was reduced the classlScatlon was given "an
other turn of the wheel and advanced to ' at
least" offset the reductfon In the tariff.'. \u25a0
The man who made that statement did not
tell the truth. The reduction In the average
rate per ton per mite' In twenty-ftv* years on
the Great Northern Railway aggregates $607.
000.000. That has been the reduction that the
people have gotten on one railroad.
. I am not afraid that any Federal regulation,
will ever get down deep enough to touch us
where we - live, because long before they do,

Father's Money, Repeats
Charges Against Cordero
ACCUSED IS TAKEX

Saloon Man. After 3faking
Admissions That Corrobo
rate the Allegations Made
Against Him. Seems Insane
Edward Cordero, who is accused of tak
ing $11,080 which aged William Schmitz
had buried in the basement of his home.
741 O'Farrell street, is in a cell at the
detention ward of the Central Emergency
Hospital raving like a madman. Louisa
Echmitz. who showed him the hiding
place of the gold because of a mad infatu
ation for him and because she feared that
he would murder her, told her full story
to Acting Captain of Detectives Reynolds
yesterday. The story was printed ex
clusively in The Call yesterday morning.
Every detail of- The Call's account Is
backed by the investigations of Detec
tives Freel, % Bunner and Sllvey. There is
& charge of grand larceny against the
man. The woman is free, though the
police regard her almost as guilty as
Cordero.
Before Cordero's mind gave way the
police drew from him admission that he
bad obtained large sums from old
Bchmltz's hoard. "But the woman gave
the money to me," he insisted. "She was
always following me around. She gave
me diamonds and money. I couldn't get
rid cf her."
When the loss of the money was dis
covered, about a year ago, Louisa j
Schmitz deliberately permitted the police j
to believe that her brother George had
taken it. When he was placed under
arrest she was mute. For live days her
brother was kept in the tanks at the City
Prison, jet Louisa Schmitz, knowing he
i was innocent, did not say one word for
In fact, the girl tried to lead people
to believe that. her brother was a thief.
Hypnotic influence, fear or her infatua
tion for Cordero kept her quiet while
her brother was being looked upon as a
criminal.
EMUGED WHEX SPCR.VED.
It was only when the man for whom
she was willing to sacrifice her brother,
for whom she was willing to see her
parents robbed of their all, spurned her
that she exposed him. About two weeks
ago she wont to the roadhouse he hac
purchased with the money stolen from
her parents and told him that she was In
destitute circumstances.
He "spurned her with threats and im
precations. She attempted to plead with
him, but he called her' vile names and
struck at her. Enraged at her tears,
Cordero ran for a photgun/ and "the ter
rified woman ran from the place.
Then Louisa Schmitz went back to her
father and mother and told them her
story. The simple old couple were so glad
to get their daughter back that they for
gave her her part In the theft. The
matter was reported to the police and
.Detectives Freel, Bunner and Silvey were
sent to the Eagle's Roost, the resort on
the San Bruno road which Cordero had
bought with the stolen money.
Cordero is far from attractive In ap
pearance and has a wife living. She was
before Captain Reynolds yesterday, red
eyed and weeping. Though her husband
If an accused criminal and though his
'.nfldelity is proven, she Is still faithful to
him. She is terribly bitter against the
Schmitz woman.
"First she steals the man away from
zne, then she sends him to jail," she
cobbed. *The woman took the money. I
know that my husband didn't."
The wife went up to the City Prison to
Bee Cordero, but was not admitted to his
cell. Cordero was trying to beat his head
againet the bars. When he was being
taken from the prison he passed his wife,
but did not know her. He was a gibber
ing idiot from the effects of heavy drink-
Ing.
Cordero is no stranger to trouble. At
the age of 21 years he was convicted of
abduction In Tuolumne County. After
serving seven months in San Quentin
prison he was released on an order from
the Superior Court of Tuolumne County.
HOW MOXEV WAS SPEXT.
Among the things that were bought
with the money of the aged Sdunitz
couple were a lot at Twenty-fourth and
Douglass streets, the Eagle's Roost road
house, a rig valued at $1700, a diamond
cross for Cordero and two sealskin
eacques, one for the Schmitz woman and
one for Mrs. Cordero. All that was found
on Cordero when he was arrested was
JSQP and a gold watch.
The $11,080 which old William "Schmlus
had hoarded for years was missel lar.t
October. The story was printed exclu
sively In The Call at the tlraa. The
money was all In $20 gold pieces. The
hiding place In the cellar was revealed
by Louisa Schmitz to Cordero, and she
declares he forced her to give him large
amounts from It until the entire sum had
been squandered.
As has been already told In The Call,
George Schmitz. Louisa'B brothc, was
arrested at the time. A search was made
of his painting shop at â¢ Twsnty-second
and Mission streets, but nothing was
Jound and he was finally released. The
suspicions of the police were directed to
Louisa Schmitz and her paramour at | the
time, but the old Schmitz cou?:o scouted
the idea that their daughter could be in
volved In the crime.
The woman stuck to the story that ahe
was forced to disclose the hiding-place
of the money under threats. ' She de
scribed the pistol which Cordero held to
her head when he demanded to be shown
the board. Her description tarried with
a pistol which Cordero carried. ,
-The police have taken charge of all
Cordero's property, with a view to mak
ing partial restitution to Bchmltz. But
what Is left of the JII.OSO will not even
half reimburse "the old man.
The "woman expressed no repentance.
She did not seem to feel any remorse for
fcer part In the theft of her aged father's
savings. It Is the scorn of her paramour
that touches her.
\u25a0 Her parents have forgiven her and re
fuse absolutely to prosecute her. Acting
Captain of Detectives Reynolds says
there Is little likelihood of, her being ar
rested-*

RAMSAY TAKES FITHT WITH GOULD
INTO COURT AND ASKS INJUNCTION
Would Prevent Meeting
of Directors of the
Wabash Road.
Claims That Trade Will
Be Stifled by the
Defendants.
Aid of Law Is Invoked
by President 6t the
Western Lines.
ST. LOUIS, Oct. 3.â Suit for injunc
tion was filed in St. Louis Circuit Court
by Joseph Ramsey Jr., president of the
Wabash, jigainst the Iron Mountain
and Waba.sn Railway companies, the
Mercantile Trust Company o/ New
York, \ k alter S. Wilson, H..M. Kalker
and George J. Gould. In his petition
Ramsey usks the court to grant him
an injunction preventing the proposed
annual meeting of George Gould and
his associates at Toledo, Ohio, where it
is proposed to elect a board of directors
and a president to control the Wabash
road for the next year.
As a reason he alleges that one re
sult of this meeting would be to stifle
competition in trafllc between the Wa
bash and Missouri Paciiic ro;ids be
tween St. Louis and Kansas City. Ram
sey sets out in his petition that he is a
resident of Missouri, while the defend
ants are non-residents. He owns
$50,000 par value of the debenture
bonds of the Wabash, class B, and 100
shares of the capital stock. He brings
the suit, he says, for himself and
others similarly situated.
The Missouri Pacific Railway, he
says, holds '20,000 shares of Wabash
stock; the Iron Mountain holds 65,000
shares of preferred stock and $5,435,000
par value of debentures, these shares
being held in trust by the Mercantile
Trust Company of New York, Wilson,
Walker and Gould. Gould, he says,
owns and. controls a majority of stock
of the Missouri Pacific, and controls the
majority of stock of the Iron Mountain
Railway.
F. W. Lehmann, attorney for Ram
sey, says:
"The importance of this, suit to the
public is in, that it is a suit to enjoin
rival companies of the Wabash from
voting its stock and debentures." ,
Judge Taylor, to whom the suit was as
signed, ordered the defendant to show'
cause Friday morning next why a tem
porary Injunction should not be issued.
Wells H. Blodgett, general solicitor, and
E. B. Prybr, assistant to the "president of
the Wabash, both declined to discuss the
matter without first having thoroughly
acquainted themselves with its details. k
"This suit will make little difference in
the outcome of the election," said Mr.
Blodgett. "It seems to be the custom for
one road to hold bonds or stocks of an
other as part of its assets. This is a gen
eral custom, and I cannot see how it can
be classed as a combination in restraint
of trade;'' V s .'! ?vf "\u25a0!'â¢'
Alexander G. Cochran, vice president
and general solicitor of the Missouri
Pacific, said:
We had no knowledge that the suit would
be filed until a few minutes before court con
vened, when an Inkling reached us. We were
on hand In court when the petition was filed.
It is very remarkable that Ramsey should
not become aware of the fact that competition
in traffic between the Wabash and the Mis
souri Pacific might be stifled as a result of
the meeting to be held In Toledo, when Ramsey
himself knows that the stock and bonds have
thus been voted for the last ten years and
there has been no suggestion on his part that
competition might be stifled.
There may also be a question raised at the
trial of whether or not Ramsey actually owns
the stock which he claims.
Edwin Gould, president of the Cotton
Belt and brother of George J. Gould, who
arrived last night to attend the annual
meeting of the Cotton Belt, to-day de
clined to make any statement concern-
Ing the suit.
NEW YORK, Oct. 3.â President Ramsey
said that the application for the injunc
tion Is made on the ground that the
Missouri laws prohibit a railroad running
through that State from selling ownership
or control to a parallel line. Asked as to
the truth of the report that the Gould
holdings of Wabash amount to 40 per cent
of the whole, Ramsey said: â¢
"I doubt very much that George J.
Gould and the Gould estate own more
than 12 per cent. In fact,' I believe that
some of the Wabash directors hold
scarcely more than enough stock to qual
ify them as "such. Russell Sage is prob
ably the most notable exception."
Ramsey expects a decision on his appli
cation for an Injunction on Friday.

BLOW DEALT
PAPER TRUST
Judge Holds the Officers of
Corporations Must Produce
Their Books in Court
ST. PAUL, Oct. 3.â Judge Vandeventer
in the United States -District Court late
this afternoon decided that the . officers
of the Hennepin Paper Company, the
Itasca Paper Company and the < North
west Paper Company should appear $ be
fore the ; United : States- Examiner . and
answer such questions as might be asked!
of them In the ' hearing of the case of
the United States against the General
Paper Company and three other defen
dants. The court also. deeded that the
books and papers mentioned in the sub
poena should be produced and be . sub
mitted to the Government for examina
tion.
Judge Vandeventer in rendering his de
cision maintained that the statute under
which the case at bar was brought com
plied with the immunity clause > of the
constitution and that the testimony given
by the officers could not be used in their
criminal prosecution, either in the Fed
eral or State courts. As to its effects
on their character for honesty and up
rightness, that was something that the
constitution did not take notice of. The
harm resulting to the witness In this
case, the court stated, would not be In
the sense of taking his property from
him; it would; not be a forfeiture, but
rather a depreciation following the dis
covery that he was engaged In an un
lawful business. - .
This suit was stated to be one brought
to out an end to an act which, If of the
character, charged, is a public wrong and
has been so from Its . inception. . A; per
son ,or corporation: docs not acquire: a
property right, the court stated, by con
ceiving a wrong or by putting it into
execution or by continuing the wrong.
This rather , aggravates than makes It
right, and when the Government v_ tries
to stop It *by an Injunction r this does
not amount to a forfeiture, because It
takes nothing to which the defendants
are lawfully entitled. .
As to whether the corporation itself
would be Immune from criminal ; prose
cution on evidence given by its officers,
the court held that that â¢ question was
not at Issue. ,He * was ' Inclined to think,
however, that If ; a corporation was in
fact a person In thesenso In which the
section of the , constitution '\u25a0 cited' contem
plated, then r perhaps It . would be ;; Im
mune. ;If a corporation, that Is to aay,
could Itself testify, such testimony could
not be used against It in criminal pro
cedure. . : \
As to tha contention that the officers
of tha corporation' could not ba compelled
to testify against the: objection \of I. the
corporation h Itself, ' Judge Â£:\u25a0 Vandeventer
held that as an : Individual could \u25a0 not for
bid an agent to .testify against : him,
neither could a corporation so Instruct
Its officers. '.'<-.Â»' t

the action of the coalition leaders after
their audience with the King-Emperor at
Vienna, September 23, was submitted to
the conference and adopted by a unani

As the Liberal Deputies did not at
tend the conference, nothing has been
gained by the coalitionist cause. The
prospect of the King-Emperor ugreelng
to the use by the Fejervary Cabinet of
universal puftrage as a weapon to light
the coalition seems to have had the ef
fect- of moderating the tone of the
coalitionist S leaders at the conference,
the proceedings of which were some
what tame. Jt is the prevailing belief
that the adoption of a platform includ
ing universal suffrage would bring to
the support of the Government an enor
mous body of peasant electors opposed
to the Magyar Nationalist demands and
thus place the coalitionists in a decided
minority. V
VIENNA, Oct. 3. â According to-re

It is 1 reported that Kristoffy succeeded
In favorably impressing the King-Em

The National convention, of the party,

Right to Summon Client
WRITES TO MR. HUGHES
Prosecutor Fails to See
Any Merit in the Claim
Made by Gotham Lawyer
NEW YORK. Oct. 3.â Samuel Unter
meyer. counsel for James H. Hyde, to-day
gave out for publication it letter address
ed by him to-day to Charles H. Hughes
of the insurance Investigating committee
In which he says:
Referring to rour request that Mr. HydÂ«
voluntarily appear as a witness before the
joint committee appointed by tne defunct Leg- â¢
lslautre of 1905 to investigate the affairs of
life Insurance companies, 1 have advised Mr.
HydÂ« that your committee la without powÂ«r
or jurisdiction to make the nivestigatlon la
which you are engaged.
My opinion is based on the proposition that
the Assembly at least has no power to direct
an investigation (1) to be held after its ad
journment and (2) for the expreoa purpose of
to a future Legislature not yet se
lected and which can have no existence until
IOCC. i . . -
Either house may investigate when la ses
sion, either directly or through a commute*
of Its number, for the purpose of Informing
Itself aa to the pending- or contemplated legis
lation by It. and for that purpose only.
Mr. Hyde instructs me to say that he Is
willing- to asai3t the Inquiry by voluntarily
appearing aa a witness ami In any other way
that may be found desirable, provided hla
rights and those of his father" a estate can bo
reasonably safezuarded.
Charles E. Hughes gave out the follow
ing statement to-night:
I received Mr. XTntermeyer's letter this even-
Ing and have conferred with Mr. McKeen. "WÂ«
concur In the following statement:
So far as Mr. Hyde's conditional offer . to
appear aa a witness Is concerned. It . would
not be proper for us to comment upon It In
advance of the decision of tne committee. -Wo
will say simply this: That If Mr. Hyde ap
pears bafore the committee without conditions
he will be treated courteously, fairly and ac
cording to his rights. \
Mr. Unt3rmeyer > Â» claim that the committee
is without power to conduct this investigation
we believe to be without merit, and we shall
so advise the committee.
Section 69 of the Penal Code provides that
when a committee of the Legislature is au
thorize-1 to summon witnesses, one who refuse*
to answer any material cr proper question or
to produce upon a reasonable notice any mate
rial, books or papers In his possession or un
der Els control Is guilty of a misdemeanor.

old directors of the company to compel

Hyd* declares that scarcely any of

ELECTION COMMISSIONERS HOLD
SECRET LIST OF APPLICANTS.
Refusal of the Election Corr.missioners to make public at this time the list of applicants for service on precinct election
boards excites the gravest suspicion. Why should anythingin the department of elections be kept as a secret, from the people.
The way to secure a fair and honest election is for the Commissioners to give to the public all the information . at hand regarding
the men who are under consideration for appointment to the several precinct boards..

played by Mr. Ryan as the presiding

in his aspiration to become chairman
of the county committee. Postmaster
Arthur G. Fisk and Jore Burke are

The Rnef delegations in their so
called Republican Minority Convention
at Alhambra Theater night "before last
presented a sorry spectacle. In the
regular convention last week they op
posed fusion on the high ground of loy
alty to Republican traditions, but in the
Ruef convention they took the pro
gramme of the boss and fused with the
Union Labor party. The predictions
made by The Call at the outset have
been verified to the letter. The Ruef
ters sought to get control of the Re
publican Convention to nominate a
weakling to oppose Schmltz, but "the
anti-Ruef Republicans won out it the
primary election and upset the Ruef
programme. In the last ditch the
Ruefters, after all the high sounding
roars of fidelity to~:the Republican
cause, indorsed the Schmitz ticket from
top to Jbottom. .
The grafters expect to use on the
ballot the designation "Independent Re
publican." In attempts to carry out
this scheme they 'will doubtless en
counter a mandate of the high 'Court
that the word "Republican" shall not
be used on the official ballot to desig
nate any ticket other than the ticket
nominated by the regular Republican
Convention. The police, at the dicta
tion of Ruef, may order otherwise, but
the courts and not the police will con
strue the law. Schmitz's name may ap
pear on the ballot in each. of three sep
arate columns, but it cannot lawfully
appear under the designation of "Re
publican" or "Democrat." The term
"Associated Grafters" or "Amalgamated
Lobsters" may be employed to â¢ desig
nate the Ruefters, but designations cal
culated to mislead and confuse the
voters are not allowable.

BOARD FEARS

Eequest of League for List
of Names Arouses Ire of
Election Commissioners
TRY TO CLOSE EECOEDS
Claim Affidavits of Appli
cants for Voting Day Duty
Are Not Public Papers
The Board of Election Commissioners
threw several" semi-virtuous spasms last
night at- its special meeting at the City
Hall over the request of Perry Newberry,
secretary of the Republican League, for
the names of applicants who desire to
serve as eleollon officers. : %V%\
Chairman Devoto and Commissioner
Letting well figured as the champions of
the/right of the board to keep public
documents from the public, while New
berry'3 respectful demeanor aroused Lef-;
flngwell's ire. The request for the list
was refused by the board, and the secre
tary was informed that he must wait un
til the applicants were appointed before
he can find out whether there are any
Republicans and Democrats j among the
number. ... \u25a0'â¢'â¢'"Â£'<
The' reason for the refusal of the sec
retary's legitimate request" will be Been
when the league starts its investigation
of those desiring to . serve, j For the
present the surmise is that the greater
proportion of the applicants are Ruef and
Schmitz men, whose anxiety to serve the
boss has caused. twice as many applicants
as there are officers needed.
Newberry came * before the ; board with
a request for the list and an offer to fur
nish two clerks to draw off the list, there
by preventing interference with the Reg
istrar's work. Upon hearing j the request
Lefnngwell went up in the air like a
.rocket, slapped the desk in front of him
and wanted to know why Newberry was
usurping the functions of the Election
Commissioners.
Lefflngwell was ably seconded by De
voto, who took the former's cue and'tone
of ' voice, and Xewberry was literally
drowned with the wrangling of . the Com
missioners. Lefflngwell suggested that
the secretary go to the Fire Commission
ers and demand a list of the boxes so
that he could put them in order, and later
suggested that Newberry see the Police
Commissioners about making the arrests
throughout the city. - - - â¢;
y When quiet was restored Newberry re
peated his., request ;and the Commissioners
opened on him simultaneously. Lefflng
well wanted to know by what right New-,
berry was before the board, and Devoto'
questioned the secretary's privilege of
seeing the affidavits of the applicants,
who swear they.. are on. the assessment
roll of last year. Devoto expressed his
willingness to take the affidavits as they
stand and make the appointments with
out investigation, and Newberry gave it
as his personal opinion that the Election
Board should investigate each case. With
the idea of investigation, he, said, the
league had made the offer honestly and
squarely to take^the work "off the Com
missioners' hands. \u25a0 .
With a final shot from Leffingwell that
the documents were not public records
nor Republican League records, .the re
quest was denied. i> .
The object of the meeting was to call
Paul McCarthy, the accused deputy reg
istrar, before the board for Investigation
of his case. McCarthy asked- that the
board defer action until after the trial
of the case in the courts'. Meanwhile the
deputy was reappointed and continues to
draw salary. X -
The other business transacted was the
filing of the certificates of nomination of
the Republican, Democratic ; and Union
Labor tickets.

Mayor Schmitz continued his vigorous
campaign last night by delivering three
addresses before gatherings In different
districts of the city. Everywhere he wa3
greeted by large crowds and loud ap
plause followed his speeches.. He ex
pressed himself as more than satisfied at
the number of people who turned out to
greet him. He urged them to vote" the
Union Labor ticket straight, saying, Jhat
only in this way could Industrial peace be
assured. As in his cry of the , first night
of the ' campaign he again bitterly at
tacked the work of the recent Grand Jury,
railed at Gavin McNab and Herbert
George, and nicknamed the fusion ticket
the "mongrel ticket." In every address
he laid great stress orf the record he has
made during the last four years as head
of the municipality, and urged the citi
zens to vote for him on the strength of
this proof of sincerity to the pledges he
made when he first appeared before them
as a candidate for Mayor.
At Maennerbund Hall, Potrero . avenue
and Twenty-fourth street, In the Thirty
third District, a strong Schmitz battle
field, an enthusiastic crowd of fully 500
people greeted the Mayor. "Last even
ing," declared Mr. Schmitz, "the real
campaign was started. I addressed three
meetings, and when I j had finished and
took time to think of the crowds who
were present and the enthusiasm they
induced I felt confident that, beginning
under such auspices, when ttje final votes
are counted* next month it will be hard

GRAFT CRY NOTICED.
"Tho cries of 'Graft! Graft! Graft!'
coming from the forces of the fusionists,
headed by â¢ suchJmen as Henry George,
Herrln, Crimminsr, Kelly and j McNab.V is
like the hoarse cry of thief by the thief,
so that attention will not be. directed to
him. The f usionlst leaders make this cry
to "cover up their own deshre^to graft.'.!'
stand on my record; that is proof of my
sincere attachment to the pledges I made
before the two previous elections.'^

An 'equally large crowd was present
at Harmony Hall in the Thirty-sixth

ing ground' of Mayor ; Schmitz. He
spoke there of his attitude in the
street car strike of two years ago.
"That was a time \ when the parties
did not understand one another." he
said. "I went to -the union men and
asked them for three days in which to
arrange a settlement. That was given
me and I went to the directors of the
lines and secured an agreement I was
criticized and lied about at' the time,
but that agreement was; so "good that
when the' time for Us > renewal came
last year, instead of signing up forone
year alone, as had v been . the custom,
tho men put their names to an agree
ment which was nearly the; same' as
that first one, and. they agreed to work
on the accepted 'scale for two. years.
That ' was a hard' time and such ' acts
as these are worth the consideration : of
the voters.

-BERLIN, Oct. 3.â The return of the

The outgo proves to have been much
heavier, than the highest anticipations
of the market and the deterioration of
the status amounts to not less- than
J 1 35.750,000. Herr Koch, president of the
bank, j to-day In proposing an advance
in the rate of discount frop 4 to 5 per
cent, informed the \ central committee
that the pressure at the end of the
quarter -was' the greatest ever experi
enced.
Conditions at other money centers.
President ' Koch said, suggested â a cau
tious advance of the rate by a full 1
per cent, which was necessary for the
protection of the gold stock. President
Koch pointed out that owing to the
unprecedented pressure on the bank
yesterday the first weekly return for
October would not show 'much Improve
ment, since the-, liquidation -of bills
would be counterbalanced by the with
drawals 'of deposits '. and It would . not
be advisable to wait until the next re
turn before making up the rate. Tha
recent action of Bank of England
In increasing its rate was also referred
to as ; a reason ;' for the proposed ad
vance, which the committee 'agreed to.
The "market is now looking with re
newed interest to the Bank of England
to see whether It would be'able to re
plenish the gold stock without a fur
ther advance In the rate. ( The situation
here; is partly due to* heavy specu

RUSSIAN LOAN
IS DISCUSSED
Conditions of New Issue as
Yet Undecided by the
Borrowing GoTernment
- PARIS, Oct. 3. â Bankers and other
financiers are now discussing the de
tails of the new Russian loan, the first
announcement of which was given in
these dispatches eight days ago.
The Temps, referring: to the subject
this even ins 3ays:
"A ' committee of bankers recently
discussed the conditions .of a new Rus
sian loan, deciding 1 that should the Is
sue occur simultaneously In France.
: Germany, England, the United States
and 1 Holland, the amount demanded
would be 1.500.000.0Q0 francs (JStJO,
000.000). half bein s reserved for thÂ»
French market. Should, however., dif?
Acuities arise owing to the differences
in the quotation of Russian rentes la
the -various countries' named, thereby
preventing an agreement with, refer
ence to the Usue price, the loan would
be placed entirely In France, but tha
amount then would be only about 1,
000.000.000 "francs ($200,000,000).
The \u25a0 rate, of Interest, it Is said, will
be". 4. per cent, with an approximate ls
sue'prlce 0f. 90. The Russian Govern
ment has . requested French bankers
and other financiers to send represent
atives to St. Petersburg Immediately
with full power to arrange details.
The Issue .will probably be made at thÂ»
end of October.

CHINESE FAULTY
Cabinet Officers Believe That
Wrong Construction Is
Placed on Exclusion Law
CHANGES ARE XEEDED
President's Advisers Discuss
Recent Boycott at First
Meeting of the Council
"WASHINGTON. Oct. 3.â The most In
teresting subjects discussed at the Cabinet
meeting to-day were, first, the Chinese
boycott agrainsi Amerlcaa goods, and.
second, the consideration of complaints
made by the Chinese Government against
the method of execution ot the existing
Chinese exclusion laws. The important
fact developed was that the President's
efforts last cummer to allay the indigna
tion Of the Chinese by a circular of In
structions to the American Minister to
China . and consular officers therein had
In a measure failed of Its purpose and re
quired considerable amendment to secure
the object sought. Mr. Rockhill himself
reported that it had not been found poa
eible to carry out the Instructions con
tained In the circular without doing great
Injustice to worthy Chinese and imposing
burdens too heavy to be borne upon the
American Consuls.
Being freshly back from the Orient, Sec
retary Taft took a prominent part in the
discussion of this matter when It was
broached by Secretary Root and present
ed some of the results of his observa
tions on his recent trip. It developed
that the requirement that American Con
suls identify the Chinese seeking certifi
cates admitting them to American ports
imposed a task upon those officials be
yond their ability. The Chinese appli
cant frequently came from come place
far distant from the American Consulate
and the Consul was consequently obliged
to refuse to identify as proper persons to
be admitted to the United States many
worthy Chinese, which, of course, led to
bitter complaint and fostered the boycott
feeling. :
Then a Chinese merchanÂ£ who desired
to send his son as a shop assistant to his
branch store in the United States, with
a view to ultimately admitting the son to
partnership, found that the boy was
barred on the charge that he was a
coolie. Chinese living In the British and
.French and Portuguese Asiatic colonies,
â¢6eing really citizens of those nations, did
rot 6ee why they could not be admitted
to America under proper passports. In
stead of being required to produce the
unpopular certificates. These were only
a few of the complaints made against
the administration of the existing exclu
sion law.
The trend of the opinion in the Cabinet
meeting was that these complaints, after
all, were directed rather against the con
struction placed upon the law than
against the act itself, and especially
against the definition given in California
to the term coolie, so it was practically
decided that some important changes in
the present regulations must be made.
To-day's session was the first regular
meeting of the Cabinet held for gome
months, and it was one of the longest
held during the administration of Presi
dent Roosevelt. It was attended by all
the members. of -the Cabinet except Secre
tary Shaw, who is absent from theÂ»dty,
and Secretary Metcalf, who is ill. It was
the first Cabinet meeting for Secretary
of the Navy Bonaparte, and the first as
Secretary of State for Mr. Root.
"All I did." said Bonaparte Jocularly,
"was to listen."
Most of the time of the meeting was
occupied by the Presiuent and Secretary
Root and Secretary Taft and Attorney
General Moody. Mr. Moody took up with
the President two or three appointment*
which were decided upon, but their an
nouncement was withheld pending ac
ceptance. He also discussed the status
-f the beef trust cases, which are being
vressed by the Department of Justice.
Postmaster General Cortelyou also con
ferred over postomce appointments.
JOHN MITCHELL PAYS
PRESIDENT A VISIT
Head of the United Mine
Workers Calls on Mr.
Roosevelt.
WASHINGTON, Oct B.â John Mitchell,
president of the United Mine Workers of
America, had an interview with President
Koosevelt to-day by appointment. He re
mained with the President about half an
hour. At the conclusion of hlg Interview
Mitchell said he had come to Washington
to see the President, not at the latter's
Invitation, but of his own volition, to talk
with him about "a personal matter."
Pressed for information as to the nature
of bis mission, he said that he had urged
the President to appoint Louis Hammer
ling, editor of the official organ of the
United Mine Workers, as Collector of In
ternal Revenue for the Scranton, Pa., dis
trict He declined to Indicate whether the
appointment would be made or not
Kammerllng Is opposed by some members
of the Pennsylvania Congressional dele
gation.
"I did not discuss with the President
the labor situation in the anthracite coal
fields," said Mitchell. "My business with
him was purely on this personal matter."
In response to other inquiries, he said
that he did not know whether the coal
operators had large stores of surplus coal
or. hand or not, as he had made no in
vestigation along that line. He said also
that he had made no Inquiry as to the
possible result of the enforcement of the
child labor law In closing some of the
Pennsylvania coal mines, out. he ven
tured the opinion that the enforcement
of the law would not have that effect
Mitchell returned to the White House
about 1 o'clock to see the President
again, but remained only a few minutes.
He left this afternoon for Scranton.

Vagrant Undertakes to Emulate
Ruse of Fellow Prisoner.
DISASTER CROWNS BNDEAVOR
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
In the crowded cage of Polio* JudgÂ«
Mogan's court Thomas alias
"Plum Pudding Tommy," chronic va
grant, created a great flutter by abrupt
ly emitting a series of raucous howls
and rolling from his seat to the floor,
where he writb/ed until two bailiffs
picked him up and carried him back to
prison.
When the sensation had subsided a
prisoner seated beside John Kelly, who
was awaiting sentence for having been
found asleep amid the ashes at the
garbage crematory, opined in hushed
tone that "Plum Pudding Tommy" was
a wise person.
"Come agr'in," whispered Mr. Kelly,
"I don't catch."
"W'y, didn't ye see Mm purtend t'
trow a fit,"'. was the rejoinder. "Now
dey*ve tenderly hawked 'lm upstairs,
were dey*ll lay him upon a fedder
couch 'and get de matron t' wave a
Chapanese fan over his mug wid one
hand w'lle she feeds 'im eggnog from
a spoon In de odder. Oh. no; Tommy
hasn't no sense wotever."
Mr. Kelly dropped into reverie and
the man who had enlightened him
winked significantly at his other audi
tors, who grinned appreciation of his
motive. When the bailiffs returned to
their post Mr. Kelly startled the tri
bunal by uttering two bovine bellows,
throwing his arms aloft, sliding softly
to recumbent attitude and giving an
excellent 'imitation of. ."Plum. Pudding
Tommy's" writhing. The Judge frown
ed, the bailiffs gasped and Mr. Kelly's
fellow prisoners snickered.
"What's the matter with that man?"
inquired -the JudKÂ«- ? ' \u25a0
"Get up, ye bum!" was the response
of the bailiffs, simultaneously delivered,
as they Jerked Mr. Kelly upward and
shook him roughly.
"Tank ye, gentsâ dat'll do â I'm all
right agin!" be spluttered, but the of
ficers continued to shak/B him until the
Judge signaled to them to desist.. Then
Mr. Kelly resumed his seat and glared
reproachfully at the late eulogist of
"Plum Pudding Tommy."
"Thirty days for you," said his Honor
when Mr. Kelly stood up for sentence.
"Wot â t'irty days for sleepln' In de
ashes an' not doln' no harm t' nobody?"
"Not so much for that as for your
bad acting," pleasantly said the court.
Lee G. Johnson, accused of having
criminally assaulted a 14-year-old girl,
was violently attacked by the child's
father in Judge Fritz's courtroom, and
ere the bailiffs could intervene he had
received a staggering blow on one of
his jaws. .
A Roman Catholic clergyman had Just
vouched for the little one's age by pro
ducing record of birth when her
father's rage overcome his discretion.
Johnson got no manifestation of sym
pathy from any of the witnesses of his
punishment, nor was his frenzied as
sailant very severely rebuked by the
bench. Tbe case was continued.
Ellis Vail was a bellboy at the Union
League Club when his roommate, simi
larly employed, had him j arrested on
the charge of stealing a suit of cloth
ing, a bat and a scarfpin, and when the
case was called in Judge Conlan's court
the club steward appeared and stated
that he suspected tbe defendant of hav
ing pilfered an overcoat and \u25a0an ash
tray. , The defense will be heard to-day.

son street. Matthew Howard Imbibed ex
cessively, and at 2 o'clock .a. m. he
created such a disturbance in the bosom
of his family . that his three stepsons,
Dan, Will and Joe, arose from their re
spective beds with Intent to discipline
him. He resented their interference by
stabbing Dan and Will in the arm and
head with a pocketknlfe, and he was
scantily-robed, bare-footed and fleeing be
fore the three young men, who were also
short on clothing, when Patrolman
Clancy stopped the chase and booked
him for assault to murder.
Judge Moean ascertained that ' Mr.
Howard has been married six years to a
lady whose name was : Mrs. â¢ O'Connell
when he escorted her to the altar, and
that he has been a pretty good husband
and stepfather when sober. Dan ' and
Will informed the court that they did not
desire .to have their assailant \u25a0 Jailed,- but
would like to have their' mother,, and
themselves assured of protection | from
him. The Judge, is thinking out the prob
lem thus presented, and hopes to have it
solved <by next Saturday.
Wade - Hampton Shadburne, a real . es-.
tate operator, accused of falling to prop-*
erly provide for his invalid wife and in
fant child, would have been defended by
his business partner if Judge Mogair had j
not crushed .the i gentleman by â¢ informing
him- that only duly -qualified attorneysâ
of which there was no evident 7paucity-^
were permitted- to : act as advocates in
that court Then the case was continued
to give Mr. Shadburne opportunity to en :
gage acceptable counsel.
The complaining witness is Mrs. Shad
burno's father, Carl Prazek/of 26 Joyce
street, endl he , testified that $10 was all j
the money tuV daughter had received from
her., husband within the last ten months.
Matured femininity from the first: block
of Federal street was numerous in' Judge
Mogan's court, and Patrolmen Curtln i and
McEntee were ; also there â to'; pronounce
Mrs. HlflSa Anderson, i occupying number
14 on the 1 thoroughfare mentioned; : - a
neighborhood pest. V It was her, -nocturnal
wont, 5 the officers averred, \u25a0 to project ; her
head through : an ; open I. window J;. of ; "'Â«; her
domicile and utter desolating howls, and
on more than one occasion she mounted
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, AVEDNESDAY, "OCTOBJEK .; i; lyoD.
to the roof and there 'yelled and danced,
her attire at the time being scant.
Without calling any of .the V ladiea In
waiting to corroborate the foregoing tes
timonyâto ! their . undisguised â¢ dlsappoint
meittâthe Judge asked Mrs. Anderson
what sho meant by ' suoh ; conduct, ! and
she promptly pleaded somnambulism.
"I both walk and talk in my Bleep," she
said, "and I'm sure there's no crime in
that"
When the would-be witnesses had re
covered the breath expended in _ a'; pro
longed "O-o-o-h," the same ; being ex
pressive of the .horror conveyed' to, them
by Mrs. Anderson's inveracity, the bench
handed down a pronouncement of guilty
and commanded ' the defendant to reap
pear this morning for sentence.
In her complaint against Mrs. Annie
Schwagee of 730 Vermont street,' Mrs.
Llllie M. Dobovich of 728 Vermont street
charged peace disturbance, and in the
court of Judge Cabaniss she orally sped-:
fled said peace. disturbance as follows:
Firstâ That the defendant Incited / her
three sons, of tender age, to harass and
annoy the complainant in divers and sun
dry ways.
Secondâ That in pursuance of suoh ma
ternal incltatlon the Juvenile trio 1 did
hurl stones ,at the complainant's . horse
as it browsed In the complainant's back
yard, thereby driving the animal .- forth
to roam the adjacent bills, to the mutual
inconvenience of itself and owner. v \
Thirdâ That in further pursuance ,of
their mother's prompting the three lads
assailed with offensive language " and
various missilesâ including fragments of
rock, tin cans and empty bottlesâ the
mother of complainant, as she was en
gaged in the task of boiling dog-food in
a large vessel swinging over a flre which
had been built and lighted for that pur
pose in complainant's back yard.;
Fourthâ That the three lads, colleotlve
ly and Individually, still urged by pa
rental suggestion, played a garden' hose
upon complainant's mother, thereby
drenching her with water, and also ex
tinguishing the flre upon which the dog
food simmered.
, Fifthâ That after : the complainant - had
rendered the garden hose inoouous by
shutting off the water the defendant's
progeny, acting under the defendant's in
structions, filled buckets with aqua at
another faucet and sloshed the contents
of said buckets upon the complainant,
her mother and the dog-food.
To each and all of those accusations
Mrs. Schwagee pleaded not guilty. If
her children had committed the acts com
plained of they \ acted entirely of their
own volition, and were , doubtless pro
voked to the deeds by the following
facts:
Firstâ That the complainant's horse was
a vicious animal and a ! menace to ' the
life and limbs of any child that : might
play in its immediate vicinity.
Secondâ That the cooking of the dog
food by the complainant's mother freight
ed the atmosphere with an odor that was
offensive and far-reachlnar.
Mrs. Schwagee would- like to have the
court understand, also, that the playing
of the garden hose; and the subsequent
sloshing of the buckets of: water were
not maliciously Intended to - deluge the
complainant's mother, but to suppress a
health-threatening ...nuisance 'â¢'. by extin
guishing the -bonfire on ~ which the* dog
food boiled. ' , . .
Query by Mrs. Dobovichâ Can't one do
as one likes in one's own backyard?
Answer by the Courtâ No; one ; cannot
legally do anything in one's back yard,
or anywhere else, that shatters the peace,'
comfort r or happiness of one's neighbors.
\u0084 Query by Mrs. Dubovlchâ For goodnees
gracious' sake, then, what's the use of
one having a back yard?
Answer. by the Courtâ l'll give it up. >)
Then the case was dismissed.

Lawyer Retained to Defend
Prisoner Thinks He Can
Easily Clear His Client
NEWTORK, Oct.- B.â Miss Katherlne
Leonard, sister of Harry A. Leonard, the
young-man who conf eased to the; theft
of more than $859,000 worth of securi
ties j from the National City Bank, de
clared to-day that young Leonard was
the victim of another man and that he
was j trying to protect the man and - a
woman. Miss Leonard v declared j that
she had given the woman's ' name to
the police and that she believed the un-"
restored portion of .the securities
was placed in a safe deposit vault by
the woman.
Miss Leonard denied the police
story that' part of the securities were
found fn the Leonard home.
Lawyer Graham Levy " has , been re
tained to defend Leonard. After a
long talk- with the prisoner Mr. Levy
said he I was , satisfied that there was no
criminal intent on young Leonard's
part and that the whole affair was a
foolish boyish escapade. ,
"When the young man Is arraigned,"
said Levy, "I will make | the contention
that there watt no criminal intent, and
I think I will be able to convince the
court of that fact."
Leonard's ball was fixed at $25,000
to-day after an attempt had been made
to plaoe the amount at $50,000.
It was stated at the rearraignment
that the oharge of larceny would prob
ably not bo pushed against . Leonard,
but that he would be prosecuted for
forgery.

seven of the fifteen counts in the indict
ment, and her attorneys. : Dawley and
Wing, ! brought the case before the Court
of Appeals on a writ of error, and,^ al
leging -that the trial court had^ erred , in
various . particulars, that the alleged of
fense is not a crime .under any^ statute
of the 'United States, petitioned for a
n^ls r case': probably has attracted .aa
wide attention as any other : that has
been in'the courts. Large sums of money
were said ito have been secured by Mrs.
Chadwick ; on ' insufficient security -from
the " Oberlin * (Ohio) ", bank and other in
stitutions:' The wrecking of the [ Oberlin
bank was such a se^re blow to its presi
dent C W Beckwith. that he died soon
after: the discovery and exposure of ; the
'mhj! Chadwick is now In Cuayahoga
County Jail " awaiting; the decision of the
United States Circuit Court of Appeals.! If
the decision Is against her she will at once

NEWS OF THE COUNTIES ABOUT THE BAY
YOUNG WOMAN
PREVENTS RUSH
Resigns as Candidate for
Vice President of Freshmen,
Thus Aiding Professors
COUP IS A SURPRISE
j Ballot Will Be Cast by Sec
retary and Confusion Will
Thereby Be" " Avoided
BERKELEY. Oct. B.â A lone freshman
girl, magnanimous to the point of resign
ing her ambition to be an officer of the
university class of 1503, has enabled the
university authorities to gain a greatly
desired advantage In their efforts to pre
vent this year the sophomore-freshman
class "rush," always a prominent feature
of the freshman class' annual election.
Miss Florence Jackson's power to help
the university authorities and that part
of the student body which sought to
etamp out the famous rush came through
ber peculiar position on the list of fresh
man candidates for office. She and Miss
Edith Brown were rival candidates for
the freshman class vice presidency. For
the other offices there was to be no con
test, as only one candidate had been
named for each office.
It followed that if one of the candidates
tot the vice presidency could be elimin
ated and Induced to resign her candidacy
the entire ticket could be elected by the
clmple process of the secretary casting
one ballot far aIL
If there was to be no contest and no
more than a few eeconds for the casting
of the ballot by the secretary, tt was ulaln
that there would be no "rushing" of the
freshmen fey the belligerent sophomores.
It was the stroke that would cut the
Gordlan knot and the authorities last
night began to lnvestigate-and sco wheth
er Miss Brown or Miss Jackson would
assist them In making it.
The undergraduate students' affairs com
mittee wag notified by the authorities
last night that if the election, which was
scheduled for to-day, was attended by
any violence the sophomores would* be
held strictly accountable, and it might
follow that all class elections hereafter
would be ordered held off the campus.
With this prospect facing them, the
students' committee caned a meeting and
for two hours sought to procure the con
cent of one of the freshman girls to re
sign ard save the day. The girls wanted
to "sleep over it" and the committee ac
cordingly postponed the election until
Thursday to await their decision.
Miss Jackson and Miss Brown, rival
candidates though they were, roomed at
the same house and were almost chums.
They discussed theâ matter thoroughly
and to-day Miss Jackson scored a great
hit with the college authorities and her
class as well by announcing that she had
resigned and that her friend Miss Brown
might be elected by acclamation.

Crematory Company Closes
Deal With Scavengers to
Collect the City Garbage
OAKLAND. Oct. 3.â The Pacific In
cinerating Company has closed a con
tract with the Scavengers' Association
by which the city refuse, including
garbage and all waste matter, will be
hereafter collected in buik by the
scavengers and cremated by the com
pany without separation. This ar
rangement, the result of much negotia
tion, is effective to-day. To meet the
Increased demand upon its facilities the
Incinerating company has commenced
the reconstruction of its plant that Its
capacity may be doubled.
The new plan of handling the city's
waste is the result of much negotia
tion. The incinerating company, as
heretofore, will remain agents for. the
city; the rates of collection will re
main the same. The advantage to the
householders lie ih the fact that
not only, the garbage, but all of th-j
rubbish will be removed without the
.necessity of separation and will be de
stroyed in bulk. ;
The company will operate under a
municipal ordinance, which carefully
regulates the handling and the,trans
portation of the refuse, under direction
of .the Board of Health. The wagoftf
must be specially prepared for the
work and all of the paraphernalia must
be subject to sanitary inspection at all
times. The scavengers will pay the in
cinerating company an agreed price for
destroying the refuse and* they guar
antee to dispose of their collections at
no other place. than at the crematory.
The new ordinance, which is pending
before the City Council, would have
passed to print last night had not the
telephone franchise fight occupied the
attention of the Councilmen.

DRAYMEN MY

Alameda County Association
Angered at Poor Service
of ; tluv Southern Pacific
OAKLAND, Oct 3.â lmpatient at, the
continued failure of the Southern Pacific
Company to afford adequate facilities for
the transfer of freight between Oakland
and San Francisco, members of the Ex
press and Draymen's Association of Ala
meda County are considering the building
of a ferry-boat of their own to handle the
business of the association exclusively.
A number of the members of the â¢ organ
ization have already withdrawn their
patronage . from the Southern Pacific 1
Creek Houte, and are now 'giving their
business to opposition ferry lines, but
this method' is also â¢ unsatisfactory, and
the draymen are anxious to secure a' bet
ter service.
In a communica.tion to "W. S. Palmer, 1
general superintendent of the /Southern
Pacific Company, the members of the
association call attention to the promises
made by the officials of the company last
August that the service should be: im
proved, on the' first of the present month,
'which promise has not been- fulfilled. In
his letter to Superintendent Palmer, Sam

REVEALS NAME
OF THIRD MAN
'Lee Bobbins Discloses Iden
tity of the Mysterious
,-J Stranger Wlio Fired Shots
BERT INiGALLS ACCUSED
Search Warrant, However^
Fails to Find Any Such
Person Within the' Cit?
OAKLAND, Oct. 3.â The name of the
mysterious third man. who made his
oscane during the attempted shooting
of Frank Dunne on the night of June
N ll, was stated by Lee Robblns on the
witness stand to-day to be Bert" Ingalla.
A search arrant has failed to find
such a character about the town and
it is not probable that he will appear
to tell what he knows of the affair.
The identity of the third -man 'seen in
the" scuffle- has been kept a secref for
many: weeks and even to-day; Roubins
in his testimony says that he does not
know that Tngalls fired any shots. !
Atithe trial. of Robbins this morning
the prosecution rested its side of the
case, in which it was shown that Rob
bins had ensaped in a struggle with
Dunne and that a third man had fired
afDunne at close rangre and then raado
his escape. Robblns then took the
stand and 3aH that his fight with
Dunne began at Washington and Thir
teenth streets when Dunne bumped into
him and an excliange of abuse occurred
and Dunne followed Bobbins up to Clay
street,- whero they clinched. Robblns
sa.ysr'that Ingalls had asked him for a
match Just before Dunne, bumped into
him- and that was the last he s^ of
Him.
'When he and Dunne finally clinched
bobbins says that he saw no one and
that when the shots were lired Dunne
had his head In chancery under his arm
and Kg only beard the reports, but saw
no one. For his part in the affair Rob
bins has been arrested and is now, on
trial before Judge Melvin and 'a jury.
SARGENT STRUGGLING
TO EXPLAIN HIMSELF
University Student's Speech
Comes Slowly iii Denial
of His Guilt.
OAKLAND, Oct. 3.â Earl A.' Sargent,
the young university student and klepto
maniac, who. was shot in the head by Po
liceman McCready Sunday morning while
trying to escape, will recover from the
physical effects of the wound, but he. will
be left in a remarkable mental condition.
He has lost the power to^. find words to
frame his thoughts.
The young man is perfectly conscious
on his cot In the hospital, with a; police
guard over him. He knows everything
that Is going on' around ; him; "-he knows
what is said to him and he knows what
he wants to say In return, but he cannot
remember the' 1 words with, which; to ex
press his thoughts. That, portion of the
brain-- which controlled that particular
function is gone. ' â¢ Â« ,-
It is painful and uncanny to watch and
listen to his efforts to talk. 'A few words
will come at a time, - then the sentence
breaks. Once in a' great while, after re
peated efforts, he will be able to speak
some complete sentence, but at that it
has to be very short.
Even in his wounded state he is strug
gling to explain the theft of the bicycle
for which he had been arrested. 1 , It was
evident to those In the hospital that Sar
gent knew just what he wanted to say,
but it took. him nearly all day to get the
idea in such.a^shape that -he-c ould ex
press it. \ He would tell a few. words at a
time, ; then ,his words would fall ; him; < and
his hearers could see that heX knew that
he- had. lost the^thread of 'his \u25a0 ; statement.
Knowing . where he : left off," Sargent man
aged ; after hours of work, losing . himself
and then beginning he . left off, to
6ay that | he, did not steal the wheel for
which he had been 5 arrested, but that it
was given' him by/another, party.*-, ? - He did
manage to say repeatedly: "I don't want
to ; be blamed" and "I wish I \ could ex
plain* it." This showed what was upper
most in his mind. \ _-
â¢ The : police ; are ~. guarding the wounded
man, hut it is hardly : likely that there
will ever be any prosecution should he
recover.

WOULD CONTROL
RAILROAD RATES
Professor Plelin of State
University Declares for
Action by ; Government
! BERKELEY, Oct. 3.â Professor Carl C.
Plehn of the college of commerce at the
university delivered an important lecture
before-.hls class to-day in which he took
the stand that governmental regulation
of railway rates is feasible and advisable.
Professor Plehn is regarded as an au
thority on economic questions and his ut
terances accordingly are deemed to have
unusual weight. The . College of Com
merce Club recently/ listened -to an ex
haustive argument from Mr. .Sproule of
the Southern Pacific designed to prove
the inadvJsability of; the ; Government at
tempting; to control rallwuy rate making.
Professor Plehn, controverting the ar
gument of Mr. Sproule, \ said to .his stu
dents: g â¢ , '
It Is right for the Government to determine
what their reasonable rates . should be and to
order them fixed. Railroads as common car
riers are responsible to the Government. The
purpose of the regulations recommended Is to
maintain an equitable relation between the
public â¢ and the railroad corporations. - ' A* the
I system Is conducted at present, the railroads
and the . shippers combine and agree? on rates
and the consumer is left out of consideration.
The charges made by railroads affect prices of
all kinds of commodities. \u0084;' :, \u25a0
Railroad ' rates taken \u25a0in the ' aggregate ' are
not now unreasonably high, .but the movement
for governmental regulation is directed against
discrimination i between -; localities. This dis
crimination has fostered monopolies,' as without
,lt no â¢ monopoly can exist. . The United - States
Railroad â¢. Commission has rendered reports
which are so clear that they form a sufficient
basis upon which regulations can be made.
The ' contention of the railroads that their
properties ; constitute vested Interests which
may not be disturbed except/at the risk of
disordering - all 'property values may bo an
swered by the statement that the maintenance
of reasonable ' rates should not destroy ' the
earning powers of the roads if theeev earnings
are not unrtasonably; large. .: .
.<.: Concerning the ; railroad companies' conten
tion that the fixing of. rates ,1s the work of an
expert,* It may be said that ? Government ; ex
perts would da the work Just as well as rail
road experts and with- more honesty. .-â¢\u25a0*

things. "You can sneak out of this house.
I don't want anything more to do with
you. I will go my way, you go yours.
I can run this house without you.".- .
Cochran claims that he was examining
the gun when it went off. He does not
entertain the highest respect for the male
visitors to the house and said that hie
suspicions were aroused by a" conversa
tion between his .wife . and his sister *b*Â»
other morning.

FORMER RECORDS
Balances of New York Clear
iiig-House Banks Show
a Substantial Increase
STATEMENT ILLOGICAL
Financial World -Is Still
at a Loss Begarding the
Showing of Last Week
NEW YORK. Oct 3.â Balances of the
clearing-house banks to-day were great
ly in excess of all previous records,
amounting to J42.531.903. as against $33,
552.T53 on Saturday last, which vras the
previous high record.
The debit balance of the National Bank
Of Commerce to-day amounted to $37,
661.000, which is a new high record for
eny Individual Institution, either on the
k^ebit or credit side. The National City
\u25a0B&rik reported a credit of $10,545,000, which
about represents the amount deposited
there by the city yesterday in tax pay
ments.
The large figures of the last few days
are a further reflection of recent finan
cial operations. These Include heavy Oc
tober disbursements for interest and divi
dends, payments for Pennsylvania and
the Atchison syndicate undertakings,
other operations not yet disclosed.
The banking community Is still at a loss
for last week's illogical bank statement.
A careful analysis of the statement made
to-day showed that a large amount of
the entire surplus reserve was held by
one bank.
NEW YORK. Oct. 3.â Charges that the
Btatement of the New York banks as
Issued weekly has become a farce and
that the practice Â»of the trust
companies In extending large cred
its without maintaining adequate cash
reserves constitutes a great danger
were made to the Clearing-House Asso
ciation tOKlay by the president of the
Corn Exchange Bank, William A. Nash.
The Corn Exchange Bank is one of the
most !mj>orta.nt financial institutions of
the city, having deposits of about $40,
009.000.
Nash denounced the existing state of
affairs by which the trust companies op
erating outside of the clearing-house ana
rot subject to its rule are not obliged
to maintain the cash reserve of one-
Xourth of the sum of deposits, which re
6erve is required of national banks by
i"eueral law and of other clearing-house
fa *n s by the rules of that institution.
urged that measures be taken to
briag the trust companies under the reg
ulations of the clearing-house.
Criticism of the bank statement issued
at the close of every business week,
which had been in progress for some
time, became general in the financial dis
trict last Saturday, when the market was
caught entirely off its guard by the
figures contained in the statement issued
that day. After Friday's compilations
from the bank movements of the week, all
agreed that less than $7000 had been taken
out of the cash reserves and traders had
carried on their operations on the basis
of a bank statement showing this condi
tion. When the report was issued, how
ever. Instead of a decrease of more than
seven millions it reported an increase of
$1,562,300. -
The statement also . reported a reduc
tion of $4,810,000 in loans, while unofficial
compilations had shown the loan account
to have been Increased during the "week.
The methods employed in reaching the
totals given in the statement have not
been explained, but it has been suggested
that gold engaged In London and also
that in transit from America to Europe
may have been credited to the banks by
which it had been engaged. The reduc
tion of loans. It was suggested, had been
brought about by transferring large bor
rowings from clearing-house banks to
trust companies.

ST. PAUL'S THE SCENE
Or SMART SET WEDDING
Army Has Scored Once More- in Eove
OXE OF SAN FRANCISCO'S MOST CHARMING YOUNG SOCIETY WOMEN, WHO \u25a0
YESTERDAY BECAME THE WIFE OF AN ARMY OFFICER. THEY DE
PARTED LAST EVENING FOR EUROPE ON THEIR WEDDING TOUR.
SALLY SHARP
The army hath wooed another smart
maid â pretty Pearl Sab in, who was
wed last night to Captain Alfred Wil
liam Bjornstad of the Twenty-eighth
Infantry, a gallant chap, who has
proved himself lucky in war â and
thrice lucky in love.
A thousand invitations had been is
sued to the St. Paul's Episcopal Church,
which was decorated in rare good
taste â the blue and white of the infan
try the motif of it in compliment to
the groom and his smart brother of
ficers.?
At 9" o'clock the organ proclaimed the
coming of the bride, leaning upon the
arm of her father, John Ira Sabln. In
a gown of exquisite simplicity â a
fragile embroidered net over a shim
mer of satin â the bride was a
stunning picture. Enfolding her. fell
a soft tulle veil, caught in her hair
with a cluster of blossoms. Orchids,
the ,Xalrest that grow, made up the
bridal bouquet â much prized by maids
at nuptial feasts that fain would wed,
and soon.
Miss ' Irene Sabin wore a gown . of
white crepe, daintily trimmed in. pale
blue, the smart frook quite suiting Miss
Irene's chic type of beauty.
Miss Virginia Belknap and Miss Alice
Wilklns, the bridesmaids, wore pale
blue chiffon frocks, fashioned smartly
and suiting admirably the personali
ties of both fair maids.
- Rev. William Reilly, rector of St.
Paul's officiated, Captain' Bjornstad be
ing supported by Lieutenant Paul Gal
laher of the Twenty-ninth Infantry.
Dr. Wadhams and Lieutenant Pearce of
the Thirteenth Infantry served as
ushers.
The Sabln home on California, street
was gay with flowers . and lights, for
the reception which followed, although
the guests bidden to the house were
necessarily limited In number.
The drawing-room and reception
halls were graced with masses of cut
flowers, while the .ballroom was fash
ioned \u25a0into a forest of ferns and palms.
In token of the army set in which the
bride has entered flags were draped
about in fetching fashion.
In this room supper was served at
small tables, and clever -were the toasts
drunk to the soldier 'and his bonny
bride.
Captain and Mrs. Bjornstad have
started directly for Europe, where they !
will remain for a four months' visit. It ';
Is probable that Mr. and Mrs. Sabln : !
and. Miss Irene will leave at an early j
date for the same trip, and society will t
miss the piquant Miss Sabln; who,
though little more than a debutante,
possesses a personality all her'ownâ a
truth of the three Sabln girls, the eld
est of whom iÂ«' Mrs. Eugene Payne.

SONG RECITAL
OF MRS. FINE
AT LYRIC HALL
A charming singer, presenting an' ex
cellent programme, was ;the' reward
awaiting those who attended' 'Mrs.
Beatrice Priest Fine's song recital last
evening. 'The programme was of artis
tic flavor, rhythm and finish.
. In detail the numbers included com
positions of so .diversified, a character
as to demand Insistently of a vocalist's
versatility. ...
Mrs. Fine sings with : a nicety of
coloring ' which also adapts itself ' to
lingual individualities, her interpreta
tions of Brahms, and! Strauss assuming
a personality differing 'widely from' that
she gave, to Delibes or Grieg, without
considering the technical coloring. . -
The minuet of Weckerlln, followed
immediately by \u25a0 the ballet music of
Delibes, marked-- a Y sharp contrast in
rhythm, Mrs. \ Fine going with j finished
ease -from one to the otherâ from meas-.
ured dignity to tripping : meter.' Her
\u25a0 tone-, production charms, ; while .main
taining continued . legato, ..though the
"Aime-moi" of Chopin disclosed a de
lightful staccato.; - : â¢ t '
Some notes breathed of slight harsh
ness and the breath control was not In
hand, being at times too visible, -but
there was far more to! commend than
to regret, with good' dramatic climaxes
emphasizing all. . - â¢ â¢ ;i
Henschel's "Shooggie Shoo" drew Its
own admiration, though: Mrs. Fine's
sympathetic ; reading * received a . warm
approval. â¢;\u25a0 ; - . .\u25a0â¢â¢\u25a0;;
Two dainty . morsels by, Mrs. Salter

Pittsburg Audience Gives
"The Girl of the GoldenV

. PITTSBURQ, Oct. 3.â The- Belasco
Theater - was crowded to the doors to
night by a representative and apprecia
tive audience to witness the first'pro
duction of "The Girl of the â¢'; Golden
"West,",; David Belasco's latest drama.;
The "' play' is in four acts and deals
with the people of early' California.
Much that is new and novel with real
ism carried to the - extreme mark , the
drama throughout. Climaxesare vivid
throughout and as a whole. the critics
pronounce the play a success. Miss
Blanche Bates in the leading role, V'The
.Girl," availed herself of 'every , oppor
tunity afforded for the display of her
emotional powers and from her en
trance to the drop of the curtain was
given hearty applause. Robert*'Hil
liard as "The Stranger" and Frank,Kee
nan as the gambling sheriff ; gave the,
star excellent support. '
Belasco was compelled" to make a
speech at- the end of the second act,
and - took occasion to feelingly thank
the audience on behalf of Miss Bates
and himself for the generous support
given them and made a plea for the
future encouragement of the independ
ents against what he termed ', the trust.

OLD MANS FUN
COSTS DEARLY
His Young Female Compan
ion Jumps From Moving
Hack With $100 of His Coin
A great deal of excitement was' caused
yesterday afternoon in the neighborhood
of Ellis and 1 Leavenworth streets by a
stylishly dressed- young .. woman suddenly
Jumping out of a hack, followed by an
elderly. gentleman who gave chase. He
was. shouting frantically that the woman
had robbed him and his cries attracted
a crowd. ~~
The hack had. stopped suddenly at the
corner of Ellis and * Leavenworth streets
and the young woman had 1 Jumped . out
and ran to a northbound I^eavenworth
street, car. t which 'was \ taking jon pas
sengers. Immediately following her was
the elderly gentleman wearing glasses,
who had also come out of the hack. They
both, boarded the car.. The old man, who
was > well dressed and apparently or
standing, accused. the woman of having
stolen $100 from him. She, on the other
hand, accused him of .having stolen her
diamonds. - The woman appeared excited,
as if she feared something. The curiosity
of the few passengers who^-were riding
on ' the car was aroused at the unusual
Incident. . " \u25a0 . .
' Before the police could be called to in
vestigate the matter the woman ' hastily
jumped ; off the car at Leavenworth. and
Jones . streets. A passenger who was lis
tening to the couple followed the woman
as she hurried out O'Farrell street. Both
turned ud Hyde street.. This was the
last seen of her and the person following.
"The .old" man who accused the woman
left the car at the; next corner and dis
appeared. It is believed that ,the elderlt
man refused â¢to notify the police. *

AN HONEST ELECTION.
MR. RUEF is making speeches. There is much that he might
say. The decent people will go to hear him it hewih
give his opinion of the false registrations which his Elec
tion Commissioners refuse to cancel.: The Republican League has
taken recourse to the courts to purge the voting register of these
frauds. If the false registrations were not in favor of Ruef s party
does any one think there would be any hesitation about canceling
them ?
If the fraud were in the interest of Partridge would the Schmitz
board let it stand? An honest election is necessary and. the people
intend to have it. Ruef and the Mayor are doing a great deal of
talking. They work overtime in abusing the newspapers, the League
and decency in general. Why do they not say something about the
three men who stuffed ballot-boxes in their interest, and are now
doing time in stripes?
Why do they not denounce the false registrations and demand
that they be canceled? Why do they not deprecate the forcing of
the gallery doors of the Alhambra by the police? Why do they
not explain, excuse or denounce the lawless impotence~of the police
when the rights of the people are in peril and their persons are in
jeopardy.
If they will not have the false registrations canceled, the courts
will compel it. If more ballot stuffing is attempted the Ruef colony
in the penitentiary will be largely recruited. The people are in
serious earnest. They have in Mr. Partridge an intrepid leader.
They will follow him to victory. . . VY V

A CRITIC OF ARCHITECTURE.
SAN FRANCISCO architecture is under fire. Mr. William
Eleroy Curtis is the man behind the -gun. He is the Bayard
Taylor of the Chicago Record-Herald. He travels over the
world and tells about it in the paper. As much of his work has
been interesting reading, it is too bad that he should himself de
stroy confidence in its accuracy. He recently visited San Francisco
and'found but little -worthy of note except what he conceives to be
the extreme badness of our domestic architecture, which he says is
"just as bad as it can be." Continuing with the minute specifica
tions of a bill of particulars, he says we build pi wood for fear of
earthquakes, and that our houses are covered with imitations of
bird cages, vegetable crates, dog kennels, sewing baskets, wedding
cakes and preposterous lathe work. \
He finds Â«obody living on Nob Hill, "where the bonanza kings
erected their preposterous palaces a quarter of a century ago." "The.
owners are dead or have moved to New York or are living. at their
country seats." The capacious bay-windows of many of. our resi
dences' afflict him greatly, and he longs for the square brick; and
stone houses of Chicago, the snug flats of New York and the apart
ment-houses of Washington City.
Mr. Curtis is like many men who know more about architec
ture than he. It will be found that domestic architecture everywhere
conforms to physical conditions. In our coast climate, sunshine
and light are luxuries within doors. Indeed they are more than
that. They are necessary to comfort and health. Our building
conforms to this physical condition. It is climatic and unchangeable.
In Chicago houses one half the year is spent in seeking "a boundless
contiguity of shade," and the other half in roasting over a hot air
register or hovering a red hot stove. *
The domestic architecture of that city conforms to those Condi
tions. In the summer the only possible outdoor recreation that may
be had in comfort is found in riding back and forth on a street car
through the damp tunnels under the Chicago , River. People die of
heat in the streets in July and freeze to death in the streets in De
cember. For these physical reasons the architecture of San Fran
cisco would be impossible in Chicago, and the Chicago style would
be impossible Here.
We fear that Mr. Curtis is a poor traveler and an unreliable
reporter of what he thinks he sees. Shelter, is a matter of climate.
The nipa huts of the Filipinos are suited to the climate, but he
would build brick houses there, heated by a furnace, because they
build that way in Chicago. His location of the bonanza kings on
Nob Hill is another evidence of his shallow information. The pal
aces of which he speaks were built by the railroad builders, Stan
ford, Colton, Hopkins" and Crocker. The Stanford, Colton and,
Crocker houses were not in any sense preposterous nor palatial, ex
cept perhaps in their roominess. The Hopkins house is more pre
tentious externally. The others are such houses as prosperous mer-.
chants would build for comfort and not for show. Only one bo
nanza king built on Nob Hill, Mr. Flood, and his house is of severely
simple exterior.; v ';
Mr. Curtis says that when a man wants a house built in. ; San
Francisco he merely "tells his architect or builder to tack on a
porch or balcony wherever he can, to conceal the outside walls as
much as possible with wooden embroidery and fancy trimmings, and
to make it as ridiculous as possible." Now a writer like Curtis
should study accuracy, as his usefulness depends upon his reliability.
He states as a fact that a prospective builder here issues only that
onjerjo.his architect. Did he ever hear it? Did any one tell him
who ever heard it? What is his authority for saying that a houjse
owner here deliberately. issues an order to make his building aÂ«Tri
diculous as possible?
. The paper for which" he writes should take notice that prepos
terous, prevarication of that kind destroys his usefulness.* The cross
grain in his article raises the suspicion that on his Jast visit here
he did not have an opportunity to see the inside of any of our homes,
and takes it out in making faces at their outside. The Eastern styles,
which seem to fill his fancy, would be unfit to live in here. We
build of wood not because it is cheap, but because we have fireproof
wood, and it is better and makes a drier and more wholesome house "
than is possible out of brick or stone in Chicago! When^we use
brick or stone we pierce the walls so as to admit the sun.
Mr. .Curtis has the same weakness and lack of knowledge that
is shown by Eastern architects when they plan buildings for San
Francisco. One would suppose that they would make a; study of our
physical conditions, but they do not. Our City * Hall was planned
by an Albany architect, arid he put the court rooms and offices on
the north side, in the shade, as he would in Albany, when they
should have been on the south side.
The architect of the new Custom-house,' a St., Louis man, has
made the same mistake and many others of a grievous nature in that
liuilding. < When these gross mistakes are perpetuated by building
them into stone and -iron,, the penalty is paid by the occupants of
the. buildings. Yet according to Mr. .Curtis, it is the sort of archi
tecture we need. ' '_\u0084 /: , '

Butters, Bill an', meâ
An', oh, our ignorance of Japs was paln- i
ful ferto ace,
Till one evenin', on returnln', we found
him Jb^ our door, .- \u25a0
An* he said his name was Jerke, an his
height was f our- foot-four. t
' Then they discussed r
His case with me. '.
.\u25a0'\u25a0 "His case he's bust,"
Says Bill, says he.
But the Jap he smiled quite pensive, an
he merely said, "Me cook,"
An' so that sawed-off heathen to our
hearts and home we took. , _ .
One evening" we was rasslin', which the
pagan smiled to see. . *
Says Butters, some facetious, then, "You
rassle now with me?" '
"Me rassleâ no," the heathen said, "me
jiu-jitsuâ some."
"Well, ji your Jitser in~thls way/; says
Butters. "Dern it! Come." '
I hate to tell
What then occurred,
But it is well
' , Truth ain't deferred.
An* when poor Butters had enough, de
jected was his mien;
He was the#jiu-jitsuest cuss that ever I
have seen.
Bill looked at me; I looked at Bill. We
says together then:
"Can derned Mongolians jitser thus the
bold Caucasian men?
Can : sawed-off heathens four foot high
thus jlu with our race?''
An' Bill he answered with a sigh, It
surely ain't the case!"
"Ah, no, it ain't."
Says Bill to me. ; j
"Jest watch me paint Â«

So Bill went in, an' when he d done 1
i held a session, too.

THE RECKLESS, MAN'S CREED.
The "reckless man whose own people
admitted that he had \ gone astray sat
down and wrote his creed and, though
it probably was faulty, here it is:
"I believe," the reckless manwrote.
"that Christianity is a living Â± rather
than agoing to church."
"But,"' the true believer Interposed,
"you say nothing about justification
y "By their works ye shall know
them," the reckless man replied. .
"And you don't mention baptism!
the true believer continued. "\u25a0â¢..-. .
"Do you fancy that a dweller in the
desert of Sahara could not be a Chris
tian?" was the answer.
"I believe." the reckless man con
tinued, "that a man whose life is char
acterized by love and tenderness to
ward others need not worry much
about ' heaven.". .' . \u0084_,, ,'
"Is. that all of your creed?" queried
the true believer.' - , f
"It Is,"- was the rejoinder, 'and is It
not enough ?', ' ' â¢ \u25a0\u25a0' -' ...
"It lacks numerous planks of being
a full exposition of the truth," was
the pained* reply. .: "
"Thus was his' creed summed up by
the great Nazarene," was the response.
â¢ The true believer turned away more
in' sorrow than .disgust, for what could
his certainty that i her knew the "Only
Truth -do against such , hard-headed
ness as the reckless man'betrayed?
"There is nothing, in 'the cold asser

whocome upon the moods. They do not leave us. We leave them. Whether
we: are conscious of it or riot, there Is a .change of spiritual attitude on our
part. We drop a veil between our eyes and a splendor that does forever exist,
whether we behold it or are; blind to it. t . 1
To really perceive this; to know that the glory has birth in a real region and
that it is for us to enter this region^at will for inspiration, stimulus and power,
Is to have caught the secret of the luminous life. \u0084-;.'.
Poets, musicians, artists, -have captured this secret, else they were not
"geniuses. By constantly visiting the enchanted realm they have become fa
miliar with the paths we grope to find. We lose oiir way in the valleys and no
longer seek the paths that would lead us to. the heights.
Here is our error. Why should .we resign ourselves to the lowlands, think
ing the sublime too beautiful for every day? : Why are we content to let PÂ°Â«J 3
and painters and masters of harmony capture the glory of their, art, while life,
Itselfâ the life of every daj*-ls left colorless and wlthbut melody?
Is not life "as worthy as art? Is it indeed not vastly ' more worthy? Is it
more important. that a picture show the ; "light that never was on sea or land

How dare we sit passively in a gray light and see. lifeâ the greatest of all
artsâ degenerate into a succession of humdrum days?
How dare we be content with plodding? How can we say. we have done our
part, because we have : duly performed what we call, allotted tasks?
Can we not see that no one does his part on earth unless he discover* the

It is not enough that we have accomplished our duties. The' question Is,
have we infused them with the hidden fire?
Life Is not thoroughly lived if it is not glowing; duties are not. rightly done

VARIETY IN FOOD.
JOHN J.HOLDEN
A LARGE class of Americans, moat of, us, In fact, do not have variety
enough In folod. In the. cities this Is not so likely to be true, but in
the smaller towns and country places, where there are not many
varieties of food placed in market, great masses of population grow up ac
customed to eat so few things that they would probably bs surprised If they
made a' list of them, so short would 't be.
For those people know only beef, mutton, veal, pork and chicken,
among meats, and generally know those only/as boiled, stewed, roasted or
fried, and generally without 'seasoning, andVonly from the most obvious
portions of the creature. '. '-/!r / - , * r , / \u25a0 â¢'â¢
' And so of VegetablesT^-orily*. the commonest sorts are used, and that only
when cooked Jn'the simplest manner. !. . ' â ;.\ -. . . .1. . ' ' '...â¢...
Plain cooking isjthe cSistomary American standard, of .cooking. In this'
connection' It may "be remarked that "plain" here means Very much what*
It does when applied to a person's faceâ something not; worth considering
and hardly~worth.thjnkinBf.,of the 'second time. ' - * .[i
Having been brought up on this sort of food, such people never eat
anything else, no matter, how long they chance to live. If they come to a
city, if they go visiting among those of more varied dietary, their attitude
is that of the proverbial countrymanâ they "wish to throw away
thing to , which they are .unaccustomed.'" Even hard" times and economic
strain cannot force then V.to vary their victuals. \ \u25a0
It Is not in the least true that the people of any given country have the
cuisine best suited to that country. 'The' most noteworthy proof to the con
trary may be found; In France, which, leads 'the world' not only In the deli
cacy and r savoririess of its cookery, but In -its variety and economy as well.
Yetit is doubtful if in the modern French ; cuisine any trace of the
French cooking of 'three centuries ago;. remains.. Paris learned to cook
from Provence, and Provence took the : . cookery, of Italy and Spain, chiefly
the former, and improved; it Into: its present form,/
Broadly speaking, everything used by civilized people anywhere ia'good

Became Pet,
Not Victim
fHE oculist was working on a book
on the eye that was to add new
luster to his name and he_ wanted
a" frogS whose eye he might" photo
graph and thus illustrate one of the
n rruments' in his treatise. He took
a- day \ oft from' his consulting
room . and .his library and went
out'; into .the country # in search' of
a frog. :It was not long before he had
one. tucked away safely in the little
box he had brought with him and he
returned :to the, city* where a pressure
of : work made it impossible for him to
do any, work for a couple of days either
on his : book or the dissecting of the
frog. â¢ .
Meanwhile_he had placed the ba
trachian in an aquarium, - where It
seemed to be Quite content. On the
second day after the frog arrived, in
the -household; the oculist's wife de
clared that if it wasn't to be killed and
dissected at once it would be a good
thing to get some flies for it. in the
way of food. Whereupon the oculist
set about catching flies for his frog
ship and began feeding the little
reptile.
. Muoh to his surprise, when he re
turned to the aquarium with a- fly for
the third time the frog seemed to know
what was coming and had leaped up
on the piece of board that was floating
on the surface of the water. The scien
tist began to be more interested in the
frog as a pet than as a subject for vivi
section and he put off its death for an
other day. Both he and hla wife found
that when they approached the aquarr
ium the frog seemed to recognize them
and would blink up at them as if he
realized they were friends.
After the little reptile had been an
inmate of the aquarium for a week the
oculist, made a shame-faced confession
to hla wife".
"I simply can't kill the thing," he ad
mitted. "I'm going downtown to buy
one to dissect."
And now the family, on its. weekly
outings in the. country, always brings
back a" box of live grasshoppers for
"Luella," as they call the frog. They
have a photograph of .the pct â but it is
of a live and. not a dead frog. â New

EDUCATION FOR LIFE.
Dr. William H. Maxwell, superinten
dent of New York . public schools, con
tributes to the October Delineator an ar
ticle that Is filled with interest for pax?
ents and teachers or any one who bears
any. relation to educational affairs. The
paper Is the first of two, and is entitled
"Education for Life Through Living."
Writing of the new educational methods.
Dr. Maxwell says: "The schools are en
deavoring at once to be substitutes for
the defects of home, for the absence of
childish possibilities, and for the insuf
ficiency of play-places, where ', muscles
may be exercised and lungs expanded.
This is the reason why the city school of
to-day eees to it that the child Is made
happy, is taught to play and to sing, to
exercise his body and to have a chance
to use his hands. He is encouraged In
the school to do and make real things
for himself and his fellows. .He is given
also thorough instruction in the so-called
'threo R's,' but this knowledge is, by go
tual appliance, made of patent service
In nls life *to*day. The. sehpoli also . af
fords training* by actual performance in
drawing, nature-study, designing and col
or work, as well ,as. in sewing.- cooking
and housework and shopwork. The de
sign is that a } the pupil has special "ar
tistic* or mechanical ability, he may early
discover the talent and develop it for
practical utility in. life; 'or, if he has no
marked technical aptitude, that he may,
nevertheless, learn to use to some extent
his otherwise untrained hands. This aim
is, in itself, sufficient justification for
some attention to the manual arts; but
it is found also that these very activities
which develop dormant faculties help the
child directly to acquire a better knowl
edge of reading, > writing and arithmetic
than * was possible when attention was
confined exclusively to books. The child
is also a part of the community that sur
rounds his school, and the school en
deavors 'to introduce him to an intimate
understanding of his out-of-school life. It
utilizes, therefore,, through the co-opera
tion of museums, parks and municipal
works, air the wealth: of the city's prop
erty that can, be brought, to bear, with
service, on .the child's life. It takes him
to nature in ; the" parks, where that is
possible, _or else brings real things from,
nature to him in the school. . The result
must be that the child will come to man
hood or womanhood more. valuable to the
State as an economic producer, more in
telligent as a citizen, and better fitted for
all me duties of life. The process may
be, summed up in; three words â Education
for .life." . .

Many Clubs . Find
Lodgment JJnder
Its Roof.
LAURA BRIDE POWERS
Clubwomen are composed of three
classes â those who think, those who try
to think and those who think they
think. And the California Club, by
physical demonstration, has proved it
self to be composed principally of the
rlrst twoâ and an almost Imperceptible
sprinkling of the last, but they don't
count.
Yesterday the first woman's clul^
house in northern California â the home
of the California Club at 1720 Clay
street â was dedicated to personal
progress, to good fellowship and to
public service. And it marked an era
of development in woman's civic, and
social activities in San Francisco.
It was the official blessing of the
hearthstone in the wine of goodfellow
ship, and every ablebodied club member
of loyal heart was there to rejoice in
the achievement of a two-years' dream
â and incidentally of two years' good
hard work.
Owing to the interventions of vaca
tion, many women were treated to their
first view of the new home yesterday,
and exclamations of pleasure at the
charm of the reception hall grew in
volume as the reception room, in rich
mahogany, and the auditorium, in whife
and gold, unfolded to their view. If
simplicity without cheapness, harmony
without faddism and utility without
boorishncss count for anything, then
the building committee, the plucky little
club president and the club members
and San Franciscans generally have
every reason to be proud of the Cali
fornia Club house, its first woman's
building.
After greetings, the building commit
tee, the board of directors, the founder
of the club, Mrs. Lovell White, and sev
eral other clever women took their
places upon the stage, with Mrs. Aylett
R. Cotton in the chair.
In a pretty littie - welcoming speech
the president outlined the work of the
building committee, of its joys and its
sorrows, its ambitions and its limita
tions and bestowing unlimited praise
upon the board of directors in its lib
eral support of her and of the chair
njan of/the building committee. Mrs.
lftchard L Whelan, in their seemingly
endless series of tasks.
Following the president, Mrs. Lovell
White, the founder of the club, made a
characteristic little speech, followed
by Dr. Dorothea Moor. Mrs. H. H.Â«
Fassett; Mrs. E. P. Scheel, chairman
"of the tmllding committee;" Mrs. E. L."
Baldwin, Mrs. J. R. Hanify, Mrs. C
Mason Kinne and others, all in the
happy strain. and â the gods ' be
thanked â blessed with brevity.
In compliment to the national con
vention of Confederate Daughters, now
in session at the Palace, a greeting
was sent from the club with an invita
tion to all the visitors to be guests of
the club at the big reception on Thurs
day night, when the public may see
what women can do in the line of
home-making all by their little selves.
A fling was taken at the groggery
keepers, a resolution supporting . the
high license crusade, wherein It ls f
sought to raise the tax from $84 to
$500 per year. It was carried, and
without a dissenting, voice â a sample
of what thinking women will do with
whisky joints when they obtain the
right to vote.
After a lot of "swaps," in the tongue
of the high school girl, and the singing
of "America" in the way of a patriotic
baptism, an informal reception was
held that spread itself all over the
three floors of the home.
Tea?
Excellent tea. In which was toasted
g-oodfellowshlp, service and peace â
that sweetest and rarest thing In club
dom.
Already several clubs have secured
the rentable rooms in the building, and
thus has the clubhouse already become
a nucleus for women's activitiesâ for
women who think, women who try
to think â end an imperceptible few
who think they think.

WHEAT PROBLEM
IS DISCUSSED
Business Men Listen to- Ke
marks on Condition of
the Cereal in This State
One hund;|d or more members of the
Merchants' Exchange of San Francisco
heard yesterday what the Government of
the United States and the University of
California, acting for this State, are
Jointly doing to improve the quality and
increase the quantity of the annual wheat
production of California. The emergency
that confronts the flour milling interests
of this State and the statistics compiled
for the grain board connected with the
Merchants' Exchange, showing the con
stant increasÂ»-tn the annual importation
of wheat to California and the decline
In the output of the grain fields, made
,the Information particularly welcome.
Representing the Department of Agri
culture of the United States, Mark Alfred
Carleton, cereallst, told what the Federal
Government is doing and what it will do
in California, and Arthur R. Briggs and
Professor Shaw of the University of Cal
ifornia spoke of the State's agency in
behalf of wheat." Mr. Briggs said that the
appropriation of $10,000 by the last Cali
fornia Legislature is being expended in
the maintenance of two experiment sta
tions, situated respectively in Yolo and
Stanislaus counties. It was originally
proposed to have a third station at San
Luis ObJspo, but the funds were not suf
ficient to support three stations success
fully,'being $5000 a year for two years.
Experiments have been in progress five
or six months. â¢ :
Professor Carleton said that the Federal
Government is giving: scientific co-opera
tion. Special agents will have charge of
field plats to breed wheat seed. Experi
ments with legumes will be made to de
termine how best to restore to California
soils the nitrogen that they lack. \u25a0 A study
is made of , the methods of harvesting
and cultivation of field . crops in Cali
fornia. It has been found that there is
much to criticize in relation to both har
vesting and . cultivation, y Fruitgrowers
of this State proceed scientifically and
their efforts and methods are In marked
contrast : with those of the wheat pro
ducers, the latter being careless.
Professor \u25a0 Shaw said that the prime
search now proceeding at the experiment
stations |in Yolo and - Stanislaus .counties
Is for wheat: containing more gluten,
which- is ! required for bread. making. * He
exhibited samples of wheat . that have
been- produced this year at" the experi
ment stations and explained them to the
assembled men of business,, who took
lively,, interest in the entire proceedings.

WISH TO REVIVE
LAPIDARY WORK
Cutters of Precious Stones
. Start Movement to Regain
an Important Industry
TO PETITION GONGEESS
and Those
Interested in the Mining
of Gems Are Active
A" determined; and concerted effort is
being made by the lapidaries of this
city and State ' to revive â¢ the precious
stone-cutting induatVy,' which at one
time flourished throughout, the country.'
It is claimed that , : through lack of
knowledge of existing i conditions . this
Important industry , has. been .practical:
ly driven out of the United States and
Congress is to be* asked, to : . aid In Its
re-establishment.' The depressed state
of the industry can be directly traced
to the present low duty of .10 per cent
ad -valorem on imported, cut stones and
it Is proposed to mem.orialize Congress
through-, the Committee: on Commerce
of, the: House of Representatives, re
questing that the matter be given care
ful consideration and tasking that
something be done. to. help build up a
business which will afford employment
to thousands of American workmen.
The lapidaries are assured of the as
sistance of prominent : mineralogists
and others, and' It . is practically cer
tain that the matter will be brought
before Congress at the coming session.
The low duty enables importers, and
manufacturers of low-priced jewelry, to
flood the country with the product' of
the cheap labor of Europe, to the detri
ment of the domestic article and the
American workmen. ; < ' \u25a0
,The petitioners do not propose / to
have the tariff advanced on high
priced stones of small, bulk, such as
diamonds, emeralds: and \u0084_ rubies, but
they want an increase in the duty on
the lower grade of precious stones,
kn,own as semi-precious stones, and
which are abundant in .the Coast
States and other parts of. the country.
There is a large variety/of such stones
in America, including, the amythest,
agate, opal, topac, garnet and several
others.
It Is well J:nown that millions of
uncut semi-precious stones are shipped
annually from the United States and
\u25a0other narts of the American, continent
to various large ; European cities,
where labor is cheap, and these same
stones, after being cut and polished,
are sent to this 1 country and sold .at
such low prices as to preclude -the pos
sibility- of competition from American
workmen. The result has '"been the
steady decline of the stone-cutting in
dustry and the shutting up of shops all
over the,, country.
PLAN TO RAISE TARIFF.
To remedy this evil Congress will be
asked to raise the duty on semi-precious
stones 'from 10 per cent to 50 or 75 per
cent. It is contended that this low duty"
was imposed for the purpose of prevent
ing smuggling, which it does~not do/ In
al! published reports of smuggling and
attempted smuggling of precious stones
mention is made only of diamonds, -rubies
and other stones of sinall^ulk and high
value,' while' no mention is. ever made- of
smuggling '* such s stories 'on which it >_is
asked 'that ; th"t> duty bo Vaistd,' ,|hus Fhdw
irig that stories of, this clais^are too thcap
to be' worth the risk, and a duty oÂ» 50 or
,75 per cent "will not Increase their Value
to such an extent that smuggling w 11,I 1 , be
made prolitable. , It is alfo"aryutilVii*i if
It Is the 'policy of protection; to check the
importation of a foreign article which > in
be produced and imported so as to drive
the domestic article from the market and
destroy the Industry, , then , the lapidary
Industry Bhould be projected by raising
the tariff to meet the cheap production
and give the American workmen a
chance. . .. -
An increase of at least 40 per cent will
also be asked on set stones as. a protec
tion to the allied trades of Jewelry set
ters.' . -'\u25a0'\u25a0'' ;../\u25a0- -"..' .*"
DEMAND INCREASES.
, Statistics prove that while the demand
for semi-precious stones has Increased to
large proportions, the number of work
men has^steadlly. declined. Fifteen years
ago, 'before the duty was fixed at 10 per
cent, there were 5000 skilled lapidaries in
the United States, all receiving remunera
tive wages. .To-day there are less than
150, and, it Is estimated that It'would're
quire more than $000 skilled mechanics to
cut; and polish;: the stones that are sold
annually in the United States. Besides the
skilled mechanics the establishments
throughout the country employed thou
sands .of \u25a0 people In other, capacities, such
as bookkeepers, clerks and salesmen. In
a United Stales \u25a0 geological report . lssued
in 1902 mention was made of . lapidary
work, In which; lt*was. stated that in one
Connecticut town Vlone there were twen
ty-five establishments employing between
500 and 600 men cutting moss agates. The
importers found that such stones could
be imported at 75 centsper dozen. The
result is that in this town to-day there is
but one shop, employing two men only. :
D.* E. Aubury, the State Mineralogist, is
actively engaged in gathering data, , and
he intends -\u25a0 to ; interest mineralogists \u25a0of
other States in the work. The matter"' is
attracting : considerable attention : among
people interested 1 in:the mining of gems,
and it is thought that the hopes of those
who wish -to see this I important industry
flourishing once again in- America will
soon be. realized. .\u25a0;>. -

OCEAN SHOBE COMPACT
FILES STIPULATION
Signs Agreement That Park
.Branch Line Shall Bevert
to the City.
The officials of- the Ocean Shore Rall
m-ay Company yesterday filed with Mayor
I Schmltx its stipulation providing that the
park branch line of the system, for which
a franchise was granted by the Board of
Supervisors, shall become the property of
the city and county at the expiration of
twenty-five years, the term for which the
franchise for that portion of the road was
granted.
The charter specifically provides that a
franchise for a -street railway shall be
granted on the express condition that at
the end of the term the road, track and
bed of such railway and all its stationary
fixtures upon the public streets shall re
vert to the city. It was deemed advis
able, however, to have a separate agree
ment signed by the company's officials
in view of the fact that the franchise was
granted without the provision of the char
ter to the invitation of competitive bids
being complied with. This course was
pursued in conformity with the City At
torney**yopJnlon that the road being a
commercial road it is not required that
bids be Invited for the branch line.
The stipulation also contains the agree
ment of the company to change the route
of the road from Forty-eighth avenue to
â¢ any other avenue not farther east than
Forty-fifth avenue should the Board of
Supervisors so request; also that firemen
and policemen shall ride free in the city
limits end that street sweepings shall be
transported to the park at cost.
The Mayor desires to study the agree
ment carefully before signing the ordi
nance granting the franchise, in order
that all necessary precautions looking to
the protection of the city will have been
taken. He will submit the agreement to
the City Attorney, and after its legal
phraseology has been settled upon will
Bigr" the ordinance making the franchise
a law.

\u25a0;" OAKLAND, Oot. B.â By t a battin*
rally in the \ sixth inning! after "the
Angels; had secured three runs, whioh
put'.tljem two to the ; srood, the Seals
chased [ in s'x tallies at Idora Park | this
afternoon and broke into the j game,
after It J seemed certain that Uncle
Henry i was in for another ; drubbing.
For the , first time since he waa sold to
New York Jimmie "VVhalen srot rid "of
the Indian sign which has been. on him
since . tho sale and won j a game. .. The
Angels grot ten-hits, but they. werÂ« not
able to turn them iifto runs, and tho
game/ended with the score 1 to i in
favor of San Francisco.
'Both, teams '. played â¢ rather' ragged
ball In the :; field, , but this was
caused ; partly . ; : by the - fact that
both : teams ' were weakened by the
loss of some of their best men.;: First
Baseman Nealon and Third , Baseman
Irwin of San Francisco were both' on
the sick list, and their places were
'filled ; by Nick .Williama at . first and
George Wheeler at third." Tim Flood,
the second baseman of Los Angeles,
was put out of the game at tho start
for disputing one of Umpire "Slats"
Davis' .decisions, and his place was
taken bv.Brashear. :'";:..>
Los Angeles tried out Middle ton, the
shortstop imported; from; lowa, and he
looks as If he might do. He got a three
bagger in the fifth, which brought in
two of the Angel's runs, but In a pinch
in the ninth he struck out. ; The south
erners . made the first run of tho game
in the second, and got two more in ! the
fifth, , after ; the Seals had annexed one
in the third. Then came the fatal
sixth, and It ;was all off as far as vic
tory, for the Angels was concerned.
They managed to land one more man
safe in the . ninth, but that was all.

COMES TO PORT
Porno and San Pedro Tow
the Water - Logged Steam
Schooner Safely Home
CAPTAIX TELLS STORY
Declares That Weather Was
Clear and Places Blame
on His Second Mate
T^r steam schooner Santa Barbara,
which went ashore early Sunday morn
ing at Del Mar landing, on thfc Mendocino
coast, was towed into port yesterday by
the steam schooners Porno and San
Pedro. The Santa Barbara is sorely crip
pled. She -is waterlogged, and as Bhe
moved slowly In through the heads yes
terday she rolled from side to side like a
half-submerged barrel. Only the fact that
-;;ne weather prevailed, with an excep
tionally smooth sea. made it possible to
bring home the rock-torn coaster. The
trip from Del Mar to port occupied forty
cigrht hours.
Captain F. B. Zaddart of the Santa
Barbara returned on the Porno with his
second mate and two members of the
crew. The remainder of the Santa Bar
bara's company returned Sunday on the
Sea Foam.
According to Captain Zaddart's report
of the affair the gross carelessness of
Second Mate Arthur Self was directly re
sponsible for the Etranding of the Santa
Barbara. Self refuses to discuss the mat
ter.
"What I have to say," he said yester
day, "will be said to the United States
inspectors, and to them alone."
Captain Zaddart says that he turned in
about 9 o'clock on, Saturday night Before
retiring he gave Self his course, which
was closer in shore than customary. It
was a clear night, and he laid a course
which hugged the land in order to get all
the Ehelter possible from the northerly
wind, which was blowing freshly. He told
Self to call him If It got thick or if land
loomed up ahead.
At U o'clock Zaddart went on deck and
found me weather still clear and the
schooner being steered according to or
ders.
"1 turned in, and was awakened by the
sound of the backing belL I went on
deck and found the schooner on the ledge
Just abreast of the lumber chute. It was
exactly 4:17 o'clock a. m. It was a little
liazy, but the land was plainly visible and
*rr.e stars were shining brightly. It was
rut what could be called thick weather." ,
Soundings were taken and five fathom*
of water were found under the stern. The
backing of the Santa Barbara's propeller
did not stir her. The boats were got in
readiness for launching and lashed to th^
rail. The passengers were then notified
to get ready to be taken ashore.
Six women and two children were
placed in the first boat, with the mate in
charge, and when that was safely
Isunchod and clear of the vessel the bal
iÂ»iice\ of. the passengers, fourteen men,
were put in the second boat. The pas
sengers were safely landed. Captain Zad
tlart then went ashore to telephone for a
tug.
The schooner had gone ashore at low
water. Shortly before high tide the Porno .
came a!or.g and arrangements were made i
for the Pomq to put a line on the Santa
Uarljata and "try to pull her off. The effort.
was successful and the Porno started- for
San Francisco with the waterlogged
schooner. Yesterday morning the steam
schooner San Pedro, bound this way. put
a.lin" on the Santa Barbara and helped
the Porno with her unwieldy burden.
The voyage home was slow but un
eventful. They came Into port yesterday
with the last of the flood tide, and the
Eanta Barbara was helped to Hunters
Point, where she will be surveyed and re
paired.
Brftlah Bark Founders.
ThÂ» Britirh baxk Kirkhill. . well known at thii
\u25a0port, has foundered. She was bound for this

Tha French bark Leon XIII. bound for tb.il

terday from London, it la probable that repairs
may be effected without the vessel's being dis
charged. '

ALL DEPENDS
UPON WEATHER
Underwriters Hope to Be
'Ready for Attempt to
Baise Aiameda in a Week
A CHANCE TO SAVE HER
Powerful Pumps Are Being
Installed and the Gallant
Liner May Float Again
The liner. Aiameda" is still on the Fort
Point rocks, and as far as goes the hope
of getting lier off the situation is un
changed., Diver Abrahamson's submarine
examination of the interior, of the hull
revealed but one comparatively small
hole, and a plate. to patch this up is now
being made. The examination of the ex
terior is being! made by, Diver Pat' Gleri
don and should be finished to-day. When
Glendon gets through! the . underwriters
will : have pretty exact data upon which
to. work.
. Captain Pillsbury yesterday made care
ful soundings in the vicinity of the strand
ed liner, and he knows pretty well how
difficult will be the problem, in that direc
tion. _
; There are still 300 tons of | cargo in the
fore lower hold.' There is water in this
hold,- which; must be pumped out I before
the freight can be discharged: This
freight must be discharged before any at
tempt is made to move. the vessel. .
The underwriters yesterday installed a
pump to clear ; this hold, and as soon as
the water is out the freight will be taken
out ; and Tthe^ hold allowed to nil again in
order to save the hull from.being strained
by the outside pressure.
While. this is. going on powerful pumps
are being installed. Three are already In
place, and six, - possi^.y eight, more will
be in commission for the | supreme ef
fort. The. hole discovered and any other
leaks which may be found _will be patched
up as tightly as possible,, after which an
attempt will be made to clear the hull of
water by means of the pumps. Clear of
cargo and water the Aiameda should
float, and once'she clears the rocks tugs
will pull her clear of menacing
fangs, f
'Installing pumps and the. donkey en
gines necessary to operate them requires
time, and the underwriters expect it will
be a week before 'they .will be ready to
make an attempt to ; float the steamship.
The- work is in the hands of practical
men, who are not blinding themselves to
the many possibilities of failure. There
is a chance to save the AJameda, how
ever, and neither money. nor effort is, be
ing spared to bring about the desired re
sult. V. :.'\u25a0\u25a0:,. â¢\u25a0\u25a0.*"':.. .â¢: â¢
Much depends upon the weather, and at
this season long spells of calma are fre
quent. So far the Alameda's hull shows
no sign of strain and as far as can be
told she has received no vital injury.

Mrs. Teats, speaking before a large

TELLS HOW HIS
SHIP IS SUNK
Captain Thomas Wallace
Becites Story of the Loss
>of the City of Chester
EAJQIED BY THE OCEANIC
Dense Fog Closes Sound' the
Vessels and They Crash To
gether Off Fort Point
\u25a0 In dramatic manner Captain Thomas
Wallace recited yesterday before Judge
Hunt and a jury the story of the loss
of the steamship City of Chester ju;it
outside the spar buoy, within 100 yarda
of which now lies the wreck of the Ill
fated Aiameda. The City of Che3tir
was sent to her,death. by a blow from
the iron prow of the Occidental and
Oriental liner Oceanic more than sev
enteen years ago. But the faclts of
that tragedy of the sea are still .fresh
in the mind of Captain Wallace and
he. r t ated them with as much fidelity
to*, detail as though the disaster bad
just " occurred. The similarity of '.he
weather of that day of long ago when
the. City of Chester went down and
that prevailing when the Aiameda was
lost are strikingly brought out oy
Cap'ain Wallace. He said: '
.When we turned the nrow of. tho City of
Chester, out toward the heads the day was
clear and beautiful and no man aboard had
the first thought that disaster would soon be
upon us. The passengers gathered by the
rail, enjoying the panorama of the city, as we
moved alone the front. We reached the chan
nel of the Golden Gate' In ' safety and turned
toward the heads, when, just at tbe spar-buoy*
oft Fort Point.' we ran into a fog . as *, thick;
as any that ever lay over the sea.
Our engines were slowed down and we were
creeping along, when we heard two bells dead
ahead. We swung the wheel to starboard and
the ship, responding, turned to port. In an
Instant two be!l9 again sounded dead ahead
and then the great hull of the Oceanic loomed
through the fog. \u25a0 I signaled the engines to
back at full si* ed. but it was too late, for
the Oceanic was upon us.. Her prow crashed,
through the | side of the City of Cbeeter and
penetrated tÂ«n feet Into her vitals.
Seeinr , that the blow was a fatal one. we
grappled the Oceanic and held to her while
we hurried â¢ome of the- passengers over, the
side on to the other shl:?. When we "saw
that our ship wag going down, however, and
that it would be dangerous to hang longer
to the Ocenlc, we lowered three lifeboats and
filled them with passengers. Just then the
lines were cast off from the Oceanic and the
City of Chester, ; deprived of support, went
down like a stone. We had but a few min
utes In which to work and tt . Is remarkable
that we saved as many as, we did, so sudden
was tho catastrophe and ro sudden the sink
ing of our,' shlo.
Among the dead of that disaster
were- John C. and Helen Hampton.
Their children are pressing a suit for
$1:00,000 damages for their loss. Cap
tain Wallace's version of. the wreck is
but one of many that will be offered
by the plaintiffs to establisn, It pos
sible, their allegation that' the los-j of
their parenis was due solely to the
carelessness of the employes of tho
Occidental and Oriental "Steamship
Company.

' NEW YORK. Oct. 3â To-day's etock market
reversed the -course of. yesterday, Â» the eymp
toms of depression in the early part of the
day elving way -.to a better tone later as com
rared with the early strength of yesterday,
changing -to heaviness before . tie : close. , The
Â«*fterenee as between the i tÂ»ro days - was ap
l|lr>r.t rather than real, ss the whole move
Â»Â«i wss r^rrow and professional, except for
flflf obscure das*, of specialties. . .The feature
of the market In fact Is the dullness. The con
â¢plruouH place of the low-priced industrUls,
tnsny of them non-dlvidÂ«>nd payers and others
with a checkered dividend career, was in It
eel/ a dissuasive \u25a0 influence 'to the .Investing
class on tbm bringing Into prominence of such
\u25a0Mcuritles often tnarks the . fiasi tUge* of a
speculaUve campaign. A number of rumors
. were put Into circulation alleging a prospect
I of early dividends on some of these low
f priced stocks. These wsre roet.in at least one
r case with official denial. The Increase In the
c dividend on Railway Steel Spring last week
Is the special inducement to speculative Ven
tures In this class of securities. The improved ,
' tone of the general liet became marked only
â¢ after business for ths day,, hÂ»d been completed
at foreign money centers. The early Influence
of depression Irom that source was due to the
advance in the discount rate of the Imperial
Bank of Germany from 4 to 5 per cent, which
Induced Â«n upward movement of the private
; rates of discount in Berlin, London and Paris.
Prices of Investment securities in those mar
f ( kets declined in consequence and some selling
j of American securities in this market resulted.
, I Tbls effect is a striking example pf the close
bonds uniting all the money markets of the
world, since the hardening- of foreign money
! markets is directly due to the withdrawals . of
. gold for the benefit of NÂ«w York. Sterling
exchange advanced In this market and yes
. terday's reactionary tendency in the money
1 rate waa 'checked. Interest continued in the dis
cussion over the unexplained changes in the
Saturday bank statement which \u25a0 served to
strengthen the showing of the banks.*,. The
large extent to which these changes were in
fluenced by the congested operations lof single
banks, bearing a constitutional part also in
the import movement of gold, was the phase of
the subject roost dwelt on in current discussion.
The clearing-house balances of to-day, -which
rose to f 42,331, 000, almost double any previous
record except that of last Saturday, wÂ«re the
outcome of such congested operations, the
debit balance at the clearing-house of \ a sin
gle institution to-day, reaching a total of $37,
661.000. The reports 'on cotton and the break
from the price of that commodity became In
fluences in the later trading and overcame the
depression shown ,by some of the Southern
railroad stocks owing to poor reports of August
) net earnings.
i Another advance In the price of copper made
â¢the metal stocks firm. The -Announcement of
I the Erie bond issue and the Wabash ' con-
Itroversy. were discussed with interest, but were
without appreciable effect on the stocks con
, cfrned. Covering of shorts in the late deal
j ing* . by traders who had worked against the .
m<Venient In the" morning helped to the. more
general advance which developed -after- the
Southern Railroad group moved upwards. The
closing was strong.
Bonds were steady. ' Total sales, par value,
$3,140,000.

. Butter, Cheese and Kffgs.
The market continues quiet and without par
ticular feature in any \u25a0 description, except that
fine mild > new Cheese is in lighter supply and
very -.firm. The lower grades show no change,
though stocks of all descriptions " of Cheese
are lighter than they have. been." The present
hot weather is ' rather "against any activity in
Butter and Kggs and, as the supply of each
about balances the demand, quotations show
no change. . â.

pected meeting, yesterday, as the preparations
are not yet wholly 'completed. The opening Is

The Apple market" was quiet and weak for
ordinary offerings,; which were "steadily accu-*
. muUting. : A* - straight carload iof the King
variety came 'in from Oregon and sold at.Bs@)
90c pf r box. Fine Gravtnsteins in 4-tier pack- .
ages ' were' still quoted up to $1 35 per box,
but, sl was regarded as an extreme, figure for
the fancleqf ' offerings of other, varieties.
Peaches," JBurtlttt Pears and Quinces continued
to command good prices, while Figs and Pome
granates . "were plentiful and inclined to east
ness. German r, Prunes from ' Icehouse were
firmly,- held . at "an advance. Aside from the
Seedless and Muscat varieties, small packages
of .table Grapes were weak. ' Large boxes were
relatively, firmer, than small .packagts. being
preferred :â¢ by ' local buyers.' Despite the con
tinuance, of the. warm weather, there was not !
much Improvement in ' the . demand for Canta
loupes or Nutmeg Melons, which continued to
arrive . freely. ,-" Watermelons were in good de
mand at .the previously 'quoted prices. Berries
were in light but ample supply and generally
weak. Some : of the Cape Cod Cranberries on
the market are of poor quality, which accounts
for, tha wide. \u25a0 range in the quotations. A i
feature of the Citrus market was the arrival
of a carload >of i Grape . Fruit and â¢ Tangerines

sold at $2 SU&U per 'box and the Tangerines

TRIES TO CLOSE
MISSPENT LIFE
Wisconsin Girl in Fit of
Grief and Eemorse Turns
on Gas and Awaits^Death
HER STORY AX OLD ONE
Lucy Plien Leaves Her Home
and Is Induced to Lead
a Disreputable Career
"Oh why wasn't I good? Why didnt
I stay at home?" sobbed 18-year-old
Lucy Phen, a rÂ»etty Wisconsin girl, as
she tossed about on a cot at the Cen
tral Emergency Hospital yesterday. She
had attempted to end her life by in
haling illuminating gas in a Geary
streot lods-in^house.
Her story is a common one, but none
the less pitiful. A country girl, tired
of the monotony of her native village,
wanted to see the great world. Her
people tried to dissuade her, but she
was obdurate. She ran away and went
to .Spokane, where a creature in the
guise of a man met her and lured her
into the pitfall that is always open
for helpless Birjs away from hoir.e.
Lucy says th&t the man's name is
F. A. Seamen. He first told her. she
says, that he was a drummer. Later
she found that he was one of those
parasites that infest all large cities.
He brought her tc San Francisco and
here made her j:o to work in a Barbary
Coast dance hall. "When he was dis
satisfied with the amcunt of her'earn
ings he would beat and kick her.
Often when she was plunged in the
thk-k of the ribald merriment of the
dance hall her thoughts would go back
to her home in Wisconsin. Above the
jeers and the curses she could hear her
raother'B voice. Thoughts of home tor
tured her more than the beatings "she
got, for she realized that she could
never return. ! >* > >
The creature who had started her on
the downward path became more brutal
to her every day. Her beauty began to
fade rapidly and he cursed her for the
loss of St. It was her stock in trade, as
far as he was concerned.
Finally she stole away from him yes
terday and hired a room at 741 Geary
street. She penned a pathetic note and
turned on the Â«:as. With many prayers
for forgiveness she lay down to await
death, surcease of memories that tor
tured and eternal relief from blows
and curses. Here is the note she wrote:
Dear Father: Well, my good-for-nothing
life will and must come to an end. I die
to-night by my own hand. I met a m*n
n&xned F. A. Seamen in Spokane. He beat
me and treated me brutally. Oh, I wish I
didn't have to die. Why wasn't I a rood
rtrl? Why <Jidn"t I stay at komÂ«? Well,
my worry will coon be over. People must
pay for the bad they do. I would try to live
and ' work, but I am tired, oh. Â»o tired. I
will never see you or mamma strain. Good-by.
LUCT PHEN.
Dr. Herzog worked hard to restore
the girl and there is a good cftance
that she may recover. The police are
looking: for Seamen.

DECISION FITS
RINDER'S CASE
Acting Attorney General
Purdy Decides Matters
Begarding Citizenship
United States District Attorney Rob
ert T- Devlin received by .; mail- yester
day the following; official 1 letter fiom
M. D. Purdy, acting Attorney Genera*,
at Washington. D.C., with reference
to the naturalization frauds now being
unearthed by ; United States : Secret
Service Agent John H. Helms:
I im la receipt of your letter of . the 14th
lnst.. In which you -request to be advised ac to
whether an alien who -declares his Intention of
becoming an American citizen, . and . who subse
quently serves In the capacity of a seaman on
board a foreltm vessel, U entitled . to be admit
ted as a dtlien of the "United States. Your at
tention Is directed .to section 2170 of the Re
vised Statues, which provides specifically: that
In order to entitle an alien â¢to become a cltl
xtn of the United States he must have resided
within the limits and 'under the Jurisdiction of
the United States for the "continued term of
flve years next preceding ; hiÂ« admission. If.
therefore, an alien files hts declaration of In
tention to become a cltlzefi of the United States
and thereafter serves In the capacity of: a sea
man on a foreign .vessel . between the â¢ time of
the filing of his declaration of Intention and
the time that he applies tp.be admitted to full
citizenship,' the: service or. toard of the foreign
vessel, in foreign water*, certainly cannot be
construed as residence â¢ within ' the" United
States, nor Is he entitled to i>e admitted as an
American citizens under those conditions. If the
courts were to recognize such service as fulfill
ing- the requirements of Section 2170 of the Re
vised Statutte. all that it would b* necessary
for an alien to "do to become an American citi
zen would be for him to file his declaration of
Intention and thereupon accept : service on board
a f orelen vessel and remain outside the . Juris
diction of the United ' States until the period
of five years had expired,- and then come into
court and be admitted aÂ« an American citizen.
The premise on which such a ' contention Is
based Is so fallacious as to' entitle it to no
consideration whatever. ' .' V
This opinion, coming, as it does,
from the Department of Justice, -, will
have an' important bearing on .the ; cape
of Captain John H.' .Kinder of the Min
nesota and other masters and mates in
the similar, predicament of having gone
to sea on foreign vessels after they had
f.led their declaration of intentions.
When King Alfonso traveled from Paris
to Cherbourg, 238 miles, the road was

Additional testimony .of \u25a0 the ; greatest

ant's^ revelation of Chief Clerk E. B.
Jerome's connection with a : shortage 'of
a date prior to those ' for'which ; Unger
was indicted. .; " 7. -.i
The'prosecutlonr without objection by
the defense, placed -In evidence? a*; re
port made by Unger to Special, Treasury
Agents: Caleb W. West : and George K.
Channlng in September -18, V 1902, in
which! Linger stated .that in' January,
1899, ;Chief; Clerk; E.B.i Jerome^ (now
deceased) made -personal use of some of
the;funds of the seizure~clerk's depart
ment,' Uerome 'being; at '.-that!' time : in
great^ financial distress. - Jerome was
Unger'sNintimatef friend, of many years'
standing and Mipon^ his assurance, that
the - : money.-, so used ; would jbe 'returned
shortly, Unger-; made no protest. â¢. But
Jerome's f financial | became
worse "instead of better, and "he after
wardfrequently.made use of the funds.
Unger.; kept ho account of those" moneys,
but his books at 'all times'showed what
amount' was; due. to\the t cashier. -. ,The
report" continues:. \u25a0 . -. â¢' '. \u25a0\u25a0_
\u25a0 '::\u25a0[ "Some; time' prior to his death he in
formed me -that :he. was making Var.
rangements by which he'could repay 'all
the money used, but" unfortunately his
'death intervened, which," fact- made me
solely; responsible 'to "the Government
During vthe time of ; the -use ; of - this
money, by Mr.' Jerome later^collections
were;often applied" to the" payment 1 of
the .older/ accounts ; and I r frequently,
added.to the same ,what: sums- 1/ could
afford 'from my salary. ' At the time of
his ,death : I' realized \u25a0_, at 'once the, Im
portance'of clearing' up this indebted
ness'as a* protection to the memory of
the life-long friend arid my own honor.
I . exerted "my utmost efforts to this end
and :| I ; recently ' placed a mortgage : on
my j property and -paid in â¢\u25a0 full all [of the
outstanding accounts.* I am .â¢ satisfied
that'Mr/Jerome neveri intended that I
should be. heldV responsible in any. de
gree for his actions. I desire to. state
that any amounts used "by .'me never
exceeded $10 or $20 ; at any one time
and Iwerel invariably returned' the "fol
lowing day or. shortlyafter." ; .'_'\u25a0:':' -.
Mr. Unger's' report" goes f on to. say
thatjhe paid; in ? $1750 to. clear his ac
counts ; I that no false entries â¢ were ever
made in 7 his books ; and . that : his semi
annual reports "i to the department' al
ways Included all the, transactions upon
which moneys .were -collected', and r not
deposited.' . Mr.' Unger ' closes by & ex
pressing the> hope that whatever may,
be" the outcome, the â¢ name 'of ;, Clerk
Jerome may not be disclosed. *
