XOTE TO FRTEXD.
Dr. Eidenmuller wis summoned and
detecting the odor ol carbolic acid In
a glass and noticing he burns on the
unfortunate girl's monh he adminis
u-red the usual antidne for carbolic
acid poisoning.
Miss Lawrence was adept at her
work and many of the customers com
mented upon her charming manner.
But her fellow employes, particularly
Miss Lefevre, noticed that this gayety
appeared forced. There was a certain
air of reserve about the girl and she
was most melancholy at periods. To
her friend she spoke but little of her
life, but made reference to the suicide
of her father in Seattle some time
previous. She had no male acquaint
ances. When her day's labor was over
she went immediately to her lodgings.
Yesterday morning the young wom
an reported for duty as usual and
went out for luncheon at noon. An
hour and a half elapsed and the girl
djd not return to the store. Miss Le
fevre becoming alarmed telephoned to
the Powell street house. The- landlady
called Miss Lawrence to the telephone
and the latter hung up the receiver
without holding any conversation.
Miss Adams went to the door of the
loom occupied by Miss Lawrence and
was startled on hearing groans within
the chamber. Upon opening the door
vith a passkey she found the girl
lying on the bed ia a semi-conscious
condition.
About four weeks ago Miss Law
rence, who was about 13 years of age,
applied for a room at the house con
ducted by Miss Adams at 1005 Powell
street. She was dressed modestly and
neatly and gave evidence of being a
young woman of education and refine
ment. A room was assigned to her for
â¢which she paid the customary charge.
Her personal beauty and gracious
manner attracted the attention of Miss
Ella Lefevre, who occupied an ad
joining room. The young ladies be
came very friendly and Miss Lefevre
ascertained that her newly found
friend was without employment. Miss
Lefevre is employed as a clerk at the
curio store conducted by C. C. Lord
at 307 Kearny street. She spoke to
her employer about Miss Lawrence
and got a position for her as sales
lady.
PLEASED CUSTOMERS.
The tragedy occurred at 1005 Powell
street. Life was not yet extinct when
thÂ»Â» body was found, but the vitality
was not there and death followed soon
after a call had been made for a phy
sician.
In the life of handsome young Ma
p& M. LoTecce, Tr?to- committed stri
cide yesterday by taking carbolic acid,
there murt have been some great sor
row of which the world knew noth
ing â or is it likely to learn. Her body
rests upon a slab at th<s morgue and
the police are baffled in their efforts
to find cause for the girl's desperate
act.

sulting in a temporary check of Gen

which the Associated Press correspond
ent at Mukden telegraphed the first
news, is not regarded at the War Of
fice as indicating a general engage

indicating the dlsDOSition of the vari
ous corps show that the whole army
is not-yet in line* of battle- The pres

garded as the result of a counter at

the Japanese might be' expected to
make, but without any calculation to
prevent the Russian advance. Gener
al Kuropatkin's present' superiority in
numbers, It is held : here. is. bound,
sooner or later, to compel the Japanese
to fall back upon their strong posi
tion within the. triangle formed at Yen
tai, Liaoyang and Sykwantung. Every
thing points to that district as being
the prospective scene of the decisive
struggle of this year's campaign. Stra
tegic reasons of the most weighty char
acter render It imperative for the Rus
sians as well as for the Japanese to
bestow their chief attention upon the
country east of the railway. The Rus
sians are: compelled to this course be

If it were not just where It is it
would in all likelihood be as sane as

"History is more often determined
by the geographical position of the
countries in which it iB made than by
the acts of the men high in power in
their Governments. I state with all
earnestness and confidence that the
Alps have -had more to do with shap
ing 7 the political enterprise and com-.
plexion of EuroDe than have the acts
of any rulers or despots, however
great or powerful. So the geographi
cal position of the western half of

with shaping the political and. social
complexion of that region than any
other agency whatsoever."

The fighting on Monday commenced
early in the morning. A bombardment
of five hours* duration forced back the
Japanese lines along almost the entire
front and opened the way for an in

About noon the Japanese began to
retire. Their flanks and center were

creased in intensity, concentrating
about the Yentai coal mines, where
firing continued until darkness fell.

strong reinforcements of infantry and
artillery, and not only held their posi

The: fighting lasted all' day. and night.
The Japanese directed their artillery
fire with great skill and searched the
Russian positions so fiercely that the
Russians fell, back north of the Schili
River, which crosses the railroad seven
miles from Yentai. The Russians this
morning resumed . their advance once
more, crossed the Schili River and en

Local FcrecaÂ«ter (temporarily In

settled, although many Americans believe it
has been. . * ,
During the recent session of Congress such
change was made In the existing law as to
hold the exclusion statute unimpaired despite
the approaching termination of the Gresham
treaty. That Is all that was done. That It
all that could be done, as matters stood.
The Gresham treaty expires, because of the
aetion of China in denouncing it. on the 7th
of December. As we - have amended the
Platt exclusion act the expiration of the treaty
will not affect that exclusion statute. How
ever, any new treaty between the United
State* and China will affect that statute and
Just now it will affect it will depend on the
precise letter of the treaty.
Whatever the future holds for us in the
matter. of a treaty Calif ornians should see to

At the Intersection of Masonic ave

were tearing up a portion of the road
bed, the trolley wire broke and
brought the car to a. sudden stop.
The sputtering wire dangled down
over the dummy, she says, and in fear
of losing her life by coming in con~
tact with the current, she was about
to leave the car when it made a sud

back of a seat, thereby bruised and
wounded, her brain injured, her mem
ory impaired, her left arm fractured
and her ribs broken. The plaintiff's
attorneys are Bigelow & Dorsey.

of the order in its hall on FlUmore
street Monday night. There was a good
attendance of members and visitors.
After the initiation of one candidate u
recess was declared, during which a
patriotic programme was rendered.
The members sang "The Star-Spangled

sang a ballad, Lotta Bean recited
"Drake's Address to 'the American
Flag." Mrs. Kothe gave a very Inter

of the patriotic spirit that moved the
Native Daughters to reverence the flag
with the idea of arousing a love of
patriotism in the membership and in
the rising generation.
' Ernest C. Stock by invitation spoke

Senators Foraker of Ohio and Lodge of
Massachusetts and Governor John L.
Bates spoke; to-night at the dinner of
the Republican Club of Massachusetts,
held in 'Symphony Hall.
Referring to the two Presidential
candidates, Senator Foraker said be
fore the people made a. man President
they wanted to know his views on pub
lic questions. He thought Judge Par
ker's declaration in regard to the gold
standard a great compliment to the
Republican party, but that in all other
respects he was in line with his own
party. In contrast, he said, President
Roosevelt had written and spoken upon
every public question In which the peo
ple have been interested since the land
ing of the Mayflower. . . ,
Senator Foraker devoted much of
his speech to a discussion of the Phil
ippine question, claiming that the ac
quisition of the islands was not a
transaction standing by itself,, but that
it was part and parcel of the wise, pa
triotic American policy conceived and
entered upon by the administration of
McKinley and carried on by President
Roosevelt.
Senator Lodge discussed national is

ThJs is a confession on his part thit
a great blunder was made by him and
that because of this blunder hundreds
of small mines for years have be-en
closed. The miners had better rely
on Mr. Gillett to enact this amend
ment, he having discovered the mis-
Many of these mines are owned by
men of small and limited means, who,
if permitted, cotfld work their proper
ties and give employment to many.
Notwithstanding that no injury can
possibly come from the operation of
their mines the Caminetti act makes
it unlawful to mine them, unless a
dam. which is absolutely unnecessary, is
first constructed under plans furnished
by the United States Debris Commis
sion and a permit to operate issued.
In many instances the property will not
warrant the construction of a dam; in
more instances the owners have no
m^ans to build one, and for these rea
sons for twelve years or more the
miners owning these propertjes have
been unable to work them.
Congressman Gillett. who has visit
ed this mining section, saw the mines
and interviewed the miners. As a re
sult of his investigation he will amend
the Caminetti act. Being a member
of the majority in Congress and upon
the committee before which the bill
will undoubtedly be referred, Mr. Gil
lett will be in a position to get such
an amendment through. It is report
ed that Mr. Caminetti, on learning of
Mr. Gillett's intention, said that he,
too. will so amend the act.
In no otrrer place in the United States
does such a law exist. Nowhere else
d->es the Government interfere with
placer mining, and it would not do so
in this State, by law, were it not for
thfÂ» Caminetti act. There are many
small mines in this State at the head
waters of our rivers and their tribu
taries which can be opened and oper
ated without doing any injury to the
navigable streams of the State or the
lands adjacent thereto, being so remote
thf-refrom.
There is no apprehension at Republi
can headquarters regarding the out
come of the battle in the First Congres
sional District. Mr. Gillett will be r<*
elected by a large majority. It is be
lieved that Humboldt County will give
th* Republican nominee more than 200<i
majority.
When the Democratic candidate, Mr.
Carainetti, was in Congress he passed
an act making hydraulic mining in
California unlawful, unless the persons
so desiring to mine by this process ap
plied to a commission of United States
officers, whose duty it was to require
the building of a dam behind which
to impound the debris. After the con
struction of such a dam a permit would
\>" issued authorizing mining to pro
ofed. By this act the mining of this
i>tate was taken from its citizens and
lilpced under the control of the Gov
ernment.

noyed at the reports that have been

responsible for the report did one-halt
the work either he or Mr. Geary, who
has been most active in the campaign,
have done, Mr. Spellacy says, the
chances for Democratic success in Cal
ifornia In November would materially
brighten. It is the desire to criticize
and the lack of desire to work on the
part of a certain element of the
Democracy that is hurting things, Mr.
Spellacy concluded.

McKiniay In the Second Congressional

During the months of July. August
and September, 1903, wHen the can
teen was open, there were thirteen
deaths at the horrve. During the
months of July, August and Septem
ber, 1904, with a closed canteen, there
were fourteen deaths Many earnest
advocates of temperance are opposed
to absolute prohibition. They main
tain that "Bell did not^Dromote the
true cause of temperance when he
procured the amendment absolutely
prohibiting the sale of liquor on the
home premises.
Duncan E. McKinlay's position in
this resDect commands the admiration
of the veterans. He maintains that
the old soldiers should have all the
rights and privileges that are accorded
to other citizens, and that they should
not be hampered by sumptuary legis
lation. As to pensions, he believes in
payment direct to the veterans and the
right of the veteran to do what he
pleases with the money, regardless of
trustees, commandants, governing
boards and Public Administrators.
FRANK P. FLINT.
The contest in the Second Congres
sional District is most peculiar. The
Democratic nominee has abandoned
the patlform of his party. He fails
to mention the Democratic national
ticket. He is appealing for votes on
the score of Tiis good looks and good
fellowship. He is easily enough the
handsomest Democratic nominee in
the field. In respect to personal pul
chritude he outshines Livernashs Mc-
Pike, Wynn, Caminetti, Judge Cortley,
Ona Morton and Dr. Lucas of Santa
Maria. He belongs to a good many
fraternal orders and flaunts the re
galia wherever a brother is in sight.
This style of campaigning may not
win many votes. In the lodgeroom
the saying is: "It is all right for the
order to work for a candidate, but
when the candidate attempts to work
the order it is all wrong."
The normal Republican majority in
the Second District approximates 3000.
Two years ago the niachine knifed
Pardee and Coombs, hence the party
vote cannot be determined by refer
ence to the number of ballots cast for
either. Taking the vote for Lieuten
ant Governor in 1902 as the basis
a Republican majority of 2855 is
shown. In the Presidential election
of 1900 the counties comprising the
district gave a Republican majority of
3425. It is the judgment of well in
formed politicians that Duncan E.
McKiniay, Republican nominee, will
be elected by at least 2000 majority.
He is popular, progressive and able.
He will be capable of accomplishing
something for this important district.
The Woodland Democrat praises
Bell for abolishing the canteen at the
Soldiers' Home, and contends that
the death rate at the home has been
greatly diminished in consequence of
that abolition. The Democrat is not
correct on both propositions. As to
the abolition of the canteen by Bell
it is correct, but is incorrect in the as*
eertion that the death rate is .dimin
ished. As the genial editor of the

DAVIS' WHIRLWIND TOUR.
MARSHALLTOWN, Iowa, Oct. 11.â
Senator Fairbanks made here to-night
the last of a series of ten speeches-de
livered since leaving Omaha early this
morning. The day was one of the most
successful of the .Western tour, both
in point of attendance and in point of
Interest. While there was no lack of
enthusiasm at any of the meetings,
Waterloo supplied the largest attend
ance and there also was the highest
pitch of enthusiasm attained. At that
place the meeting was held in the
public park. The crowd was so ex
tended that the Senator's Voice could
not be heard on the outskirts and the
people so thronged the streets that it
was almost impossible for the auto
mobile in which he was seated to make
its way to the park.
At Iowa Falls Senator Fairbanks
dwelt upon the prosperity of the farm
ers. He said:
An eminent Democratic authority some time
ago, in the hope of winning the support of tha
azricultural vote, asserted that .the Repub
lican party had done little for the farmers of
the country. He contrasted the expenditure of
five or six millions of dollars for the support
of the Agricultural Department with expendi
tures for the support of other branches of the-
Federal service. His statement was not en
tirely accurate, though he did not mean that it
should fall short of the absolute truth. The
Republican party has not only appropriated
over five millions for the support of that de
partment, at the head of which is the great
Secretary of Agriculture, James Wilson of
Iowa, but It appropriated more than twenty
million* of dollars at the last session for the
support of the rural free delivery service
throughout the United States. That service Is
one of the fruits of Republican administration.
More important than these are the benefits
coming to the farmers through the beneficent
operations of the policies of the Republican
party. The fact Is that our farmers have been
benefited by the operation of these policies
durlr*. the lai>t seven and a half years more
than they ever have been benefited In all /of
the history of the republic.

SUCCESS OF PROHIBITION.
Getting back to the original ques
tion, you will notice that in giving fig
ures of majorities in States the expert
seldom makes prophecies as to North
Dakota. It' is because of the disposi
tion to make it unanimous there. Of
117 daily and weekly papers issued in
the State of North Dakota, there are
but one daily and eight weeklies de
voted to Democracy. There are near
ly always two papers in any town
where theiie is population enough to
support one. That is to say where
there are enough people to barely war
rant some one In starting a paper, and
he does start it, a competitor quickly
follows and the spectacle is furnished
of two papers, often they ; are daily
papers, thriving or \ showing every, sign
of . thriving, in communities | so sparse
as to cause wonder that one could
exist. This is simply in evidence of
prosperous conditions. The solitary
Democractic daily' is published at
Grand Forks, one of the most popu
lous cities of the State, and its history
has been one long, story of failure.
Some yojing men have recently taken
it | off the hands â¢ of , its late unhappy
proprietor and they say they have high
hopes. .
Everybody is happy in North Da
kota, now. Things are going well.
Crops are the largest known for a long
time. There's nothing but; prosperity.
A REPUBLICAN PRESS.
The Representative in Congress who
will hold Spalding's seat is J. A.
Gronna, a merchant of Lakota, Nelson
County, on the north line of the State.
The cry that the north wanted ! and
should have representation was offered
as an excuse for the defeat of Spalding,
but it is well understood that his own
indiscretion in taking sides in a family
fight not directed against him is the
real cause. Gronna is a Norwegian and
a close friend of Senator Hansbrough.
,The State Attorney General, Frick,
comes from the same town of La
kota and, seeing that the question of
geography was cutting such a figure,
Gronna declared; Vhen the nomination
for Congress was offered him, that, if
it was going to affect Frick's chances
for a renomination he would not ac
cept. He was assured that it would
not and it didn't. '
During the first day of the sitting
of the convention Judge John M.
Cochrane of the Supreme Court died.
The convention adjourned for that day
out of respect. When it adjourned
finally Edward Engurud, a young
lawyer, who attended it as a delegate
and with no thought of receiving any
honor at its hands, had been nominat
ed for the place and, of course, will be
elected. This is just to show how the
whirligig playa in politics. '
THE NEW REPRESENTATIVE.
But there . was a factional .fight on
in his section of the State. Both fat>
tions/ of course, looked to him to join
it in the overthrow of the other.'Spald-
Ing's own particular friends, saw. that
the scrap was no place for. him and
when he had gotten so far as St. Paul
on his way west from Washington he
received a wire signed by several of
these, telling him to go fishing in some
remote Minnesota stream and not be
heard from until after the election. But
Spalding could not see the necessity.
Had he not won his place by fighting
and if there was anything doing in
politics in his State his place was in
the thick of it. He went to Fargo and
made enemies. He soon saw that the
other fellow's fight had become his own,
but he boasted that on the floor of the
then impending convention he would
win. He secured but 101 votes in a total
flf 525.
There was the case of Representative
Spalding. He was a clever man, a good
lawyer and made a capable and ef
fective v Representative. He was strong
in his home town of Fargo, and that
heiwould be unseated by the State con
vention of his party was the thing
furthest from his thoughts. He had
eat among the mighty at Washington,
had acquitted himself well, had secured
all that was coming to his State out
of the general struggle" for appropria
tions and had rendered as effective ser
vice as could be expected of one man.
With this prestige added to the quality
that got him- there in the first place,
why should be not go back? He hadn't
even asked himself thla , question, th*
case seemed so clear. â¢
A CASE IN POINT.
The only excitement that can be
evolved out of a campaign in North
Dakota is secured by splits and con
tests within the party. It is never: a
question of the election of a Republi
can to office, but a contest as to
which Republican." And so, being put
to it in this regard, they generally
manage to eke out enough sport from
campaign to campaign to make it
worth while. There are so many good
Republicans who are also good men in
North Dakota that no one man or set
of men may say, having been lifted to
an eminence. "This is my place; I will
pre-empt this peak. for my own; Re
publican majorities are so certain here'
that I have only now to signify that
I am in the game." Â«.
Fairbanks is making a great record
as a campaigner, but he is not making
the record for the record's sake.
Where a speech may be cut out of the
itinerary without loss to his cause, he
is quite willing. And so he saved his
voice in North Dakota. North Da
kota is one of those States where you
listen in vain foi the cheery assurance
of the Democratic chairman that
things look good to him and that "nev
er before in the history of the party
was victory so certain." With Â¦ the
Democrats here, it is a mere matter
of going through the forms, so far at
least as the national ticket is con
cerned.
BISMARCK, S. Â»D., Oct. 11. â Of
course Senator Fairbanks knew why
he chose the Sabbath day upon which,
in his westward course, to cross the
State of North Dakota, to enter from
the east the land of promise â special
agricultural promise â of thrift and of
temperance; to tarry only here and
there for 'an hour or so and pass on
to the next; to stop off midway and
attend church, and then to go on into
the. strenuous and politically turbulent
State of Montana before the week days
had come that make it meet and ne
cessary to make campaign speeches.

A second amendment provides that
the Board of Education shall have
power once in each year to ordain the
levy by the Board of Supervisors of a
tax of not more than ten cents on

The Board of Education yesterday
issued a list of the proposed amend
ments to the charter which it desires
to have submitted to a vote of the peo
ple. Petitions are being circulated with
a view to obtaining the signatures of at
least fifteen per cent of the qualified
electors asking the Board of Super
visors to submit amendments to the
existing charter provisions and also to
add many subdivisions relative to the
conduct of the school department. The
amendments are designed to render the
Board of Education Independent of the
Board of Supervisors in school affairs
and It is the opinion of President Ron
covieri, that if they are adopted the
schools will be greatly benefited by the
changed conditions.

BRYAN HAS BUSY DAY.
To be sure, the saloons get most of
their trade from the larger towns.
The streets, of Fargo are patrolled day
and night by attractive conveyances
bearing the names in modest letters
of the well known places across the
river and any who wish to go to these
places have but to step in or hail the
driver to be whirled over the bridge
without charge. The rigs are also on
call to convey the customers home,
drunk or sober. These rigs, which
are of many descriptions, are referred
to in local speech as jag wagons.
And to be sure it. will be said that
so far as these towns on the State's
margin are concerned the prohibition
law simply dr.ew a definite., line about
their tenderloin, which would be a
good thing for any town. And of
course this is true, but exactly the
same sentiment is expressed in other
towns of the State with regard to the
prohibition law, that it would not be
exchanged for the old wide open con
dition. ' Of course there is always the
reference to the "blind pig," said to be
everywhere, and of course there is
something to it, but the pig is incon
spicuous and its effects not apparent.

of a return to the old system in any
part of the State, and I asked a great
many. On the western border, at
Fargo and Grand Forks, they simply
point across the river. At Grand
Forks and Fargo you find Just as
pretty little cities as you want to see,
beautiful homes, neatly ' kept lawns
and gardens, .clean streets, handsome,
public buildings, an air of -self-respect
and conscious pride. Just over the
little bridge that spans the Red River
at Grand Forks is East Grand Forks,
and from Fargo there is the town of
Moorhead. They are in the State of
â¢Minnesota, and both of them are com
posed chiefly of saloons. In the case
of Moorhead there are a number of
saloons ; equi^-ed with plate-glass
mirrors $ and electric lights to attract
and dazzle "the best class of trade,"
but there are saloons of every char
acter and in every part of the town.
Fargo and Moorhead made a fight
many years ago for supremacy, and
at the time of the prohibition agita
tion "it was prophesied, that in case
of its success the center of popula
tion as between the two towns would
cross the river Into Minnesota. ,The
saloons did cross the river, and spent
largo sums in their embellishment.
There \vÂ«*re. as had been predicted
that there would be, a great many va
cant storerooms In Fargo where the
saloons had been, and rents came
down as a consequence. But there are
no vacant stores now in Fargo or
Grand. Forks. .-Â»

advantage of fighting behind breast
works and utilizing their superiority
in mountain guns. The general superi
ority of the Japanese in mountain oper
ations is conceded. The Kussian cora
ma.r.der is aware of the difficulties of the
task before him. has measured them
well, and is confident of his ability to
overcome them. If General Kuropatkin
possessed an army of half a million
men he could leave a sufficient force to
attack the triangle while he moved
with the remainder around the eastern
and western flanks.
This is considered in the best Inform
ed circles at the War Office to be im
practicable with the numbers now com
posing General Kuropatkin's army and
a frontal advance is the only alter
r stive. Operations, however, are likely
to be marked by feints on the right
and left. The Japanese probably will
make similar movements until both
armies become involved in a death
struggle.

GIVES CREDIT TO NODZU
Kn~li-h Correspondent Says Oyama
Did Not Save IJsoyang.
LONDON. ' Oct. If.â The English
papers this morning are still discussing
what they regard as General Kuropat
kin's inexplicable change of plan of
campaign, and with the Increasing con
viction that now is shared by most of
the European critics that it is due to
pressure from St. Petersburg.
Th* situation will be still more com
plicated if the extraordinary statement
sent by Bennett Burleigh from Shang
hai to ths Daily Telegraph to-day should
tern out to b? correct. Burleigh says
it fs believed Field Marshal Oyama and
his staff will return or be recalled to
Japan, ostensibly because the army is
going into winter quarters, and that
General Nodzu will take over the com
mand.
"It is now well known among the
better classes of Japan." Burleigh
adds, "that it was Nodzu who saved
the situation at the battle of Liaoyang.
Oyama and the headquarters had act
ually ordered a retreat, when Nodzu
â¢vigorously protested against such a
step and begged them to make an
other desperate effort, the more di
rectly co-opâ¬rating with Oku's right.
To Nodzu, therefore, is due the sole
credit of averting a disastrous retreat,
which he warded off by sending in and
almost sacrificing the entire Twentieth
Regiment of the Second Division."
According to Burleigh the Japanese
still have no intention of proceeding
much farther north than Mukden, and
will only with exceptional circum
stances attack Tie- Pass this season.

LONDON*. Oct. 11. â The British j
Government is closely watching to j
discover the cause and effect of Gen- !
pral Kuropatkin"s forward movement- !
Baron Hayasht, the Japanese Minister i
here, conveyed such information as
he possessed to Foreign ilinister Lans
dewne on Monday. Baron Hayashi \
deprecates . the ridicule that is being;
showered by the English press on Gen- Â¦
eral Kuropatkin's proclamation.
"Even the assumption of" an initia- j
fve," said the Japanese Minister, j
â¢must benefit the Russian forces. I j
heve no more belief that General Ku- |
rcpatkin's move is a bluff than I be- |
Iieve that Marquis Oyama's lack of i
aggression is due to an attempt to lure I
Kuropatkin into a trap. The situa- ;
tion really seems quite simple. Oyama.

has been fortifying, step by step, and |
never advancing unless he was able to '
reassure the absolute safety of his |
constantly lengthening lines of com- }
munication. He must have had enough j
difficulty in bringing up sufficient sup- '
plies and ammunition for his large !
army, which were depleted greatly at'
the battle of Liaoyang. If he had ;
bt en ready he would doubtless have '
tiken that advantage which belongs
in all Â¦warfare to the aggressor, and
attacked Kuropatkin at Mukden. It is
o. point in Kuropatkin's favor that If \
he was ready a week from now there I
should be a . decisive . battle, and it is!
likely to occur at Uaoyang or on the j
Taitse River. '
"It does not matter much whether;
Kuropatkin has assumed the offensive *
upon orde.r3 from St. Petersburg or byj
his own desire: he has taken a tre- i
mendous risk, and it. is not for me to '
say whether he was justified or not. |
It is all very well enough to say that I
the Russian commander leaves his com- '
mupications open to attack, but only a â¢
very large force can adequately dis-{
turb such lines, as Kuropatkin pos- Â¦>
sesses. I hear on good authority that he
has got men standing almost shoulder
to shoulder along the railway. I would
not be surprised if Kuropatkin. instead
cf continuing a frontal advance, should
launch the whole of his army against
General Kuroki's flanking force. It '
would be a bold stroke and precipitate â¢
a great struggle. Whatever, happens â |
whether Kuropatkin is allowed to
march comparatively unopposed to the Â¦
Taitse River, where Oyama has been j
fortifying, or whether he diverts his ;
array in an endeavor to crush Kurokiâ '
the' result -of .the present phase of the
Manchuria campaign means much, and f
perhaps is almost as vital to one side '
a.s to thÂ« other." :
No fears,, are expressed in Japanese *
or British . military circles that Field :
Marshal Oyama, after carefully en
trenching Liaoyang. _will not be able to
hold the position that he captured.
er plays a foremost part in their plans.
In vietv of the approaching close of
navigation at Tinkow and of the fact
that the line at Pitzwo is long and
cumbersome and liable to interruption,
they must consider Fengwengchang
r.r-d Takushan as the source of sup
plies during the winter, and with this
::: view the eastern communications of
LJaoyang are of the utmost importance.
The Yentai triangle is admirably sit
uited to protect them. Field Marshal
Oyuma must therefore hold this tri
angle at a'l costs. The problem con
fronting General Kuropatkin in the
immediate future is the capture of the
fcrtified heights composing this trian
gle, where the Japanese will have the
advantage of fighting behind breast-
schedule following the Great Northern
Flyer. It is presumed that the Jour
nal was tampered with at Rugby.
During the summer a number of Rus
sians have been employed on the sec
tion crew at Towner. Some of them,
it is said, have disappeared. It is
known that the Russian and Japanese
Governments have had spies in this
country with a view of watching sus
picious shipments to the Orient.

RUSSIANS FORCE JAPANESE BUCK
TOKIO, Oct. 11.â The loss of the ar
mored gunboat Hei-Yen was announced
to-day and permission was granted by
the authorities to publish the details
of the disaster.^ The Hei-Yen struck a
mine off Pigeon Hay on the nicht of
September IS and foundered. With the
vessel 157 men went down. Two oetty
officers and two sailors manazed to
reach Chiaopai Island, from which they
were rescued. The Hei-Yen. which
was engaged in guard duty off Pisreon
Bay. was missed by ihe fleet and a
search for the vessel was immediately
begun.
The petty ofiicers and sailors found
on Chiaopai Island reported that at
dusk on September 15 a storm came up,
accompanied by high seas. The Hei-
Yen endeavored to return to her base,
when she suddenly struck a floating
mine, which exploded under her star
board side amidships. The vessel be
gan to sink and an attempt was made
to lower the boats. The boats were
swamped and the crew jumped into
the sea. where, owing to the heavy
combers, they were quickly drowned.
The Japanese fleet carefully searched
the patrolled locality, but failed to find
any other survivors.
An. official announcement of the dis
aster issued to-day says:
"It is highly regrettable that no re
port in any form has been received of
the fate of the other survivors. The sad
event was made worse on account of
the weather, which must have added
greatly to the already awful result
caused by the explosion of the mine."

JEFFERSON CITY. Mo., Oct. 11. â
E. Zeigler and L. A. Haynes. brake
men on the freight train which
crashed into a Missouri Pacific World's
Fair train near Warrensburg-. Mo.,
yesterday were arrested here to-day on
warrants charging them with stealing
$37 from the tody of a fellow brake
man named Seidel. who was killed. A
bloodstained railroad ticket, issued to
James England of. Dexter. Kans.. was
found in the pocket of one of the men
under arreÂ«t. Zeigler and Haynes are
among thoÂ«=e" accused by the Warrens
burg Coroner's jury as responsible for
the wreck.
BRAKKMKN UNDER ARREST.
Some of the jurors were in favor of
finding a true bill against the oCciais
because of neglect of duty ia failing to
observe the requirements of law as to
qualifications of members of precinct
boards. Others thought it better to re
turn a presentment, which would mean
that the District Attorney should Insti
tute prosecution and the case go
through the course of a preliminary ex
amination. But there were enough
jurors who were oposed to any such
action to prevent the step. The at
tendance was barely a quorum.
The effort to set the law la motion
against Messrs. Roberts. Voorsanger.
Devoto, LefSngwell and McGutre was
energetically urged by those who
thought there was ground to justify
the course, the Commissioners them
selves having admitted when called to
testify that they did not enforce the
statutory provision that election offi
cers must be taxpayers and residents
of the precincts in which they are ap
pcinted to serve. The opposition to
such a move was no less vigorous, and
the end was that the Grand Jurors be
came Involved in a discussion that be
came heated and brought proceedings
to a close suddenly. â¢
The jury spent the larger part of
the evening in taking testimony as to
alleged misconduct on the part of the
election officers in the Almshouse pre
cinct on primary day. Fairfax H.
Whelan. W. H. Hazell and Dan Fitz
gerald told how their challenges were
ignored and testified that the officers
let many men vote who, it was clearly
demonstrated, were not entitled to the
franchise. The following were the
members of the board and they all
were summoned before the Jury last
evening: Joseph Rebstock. John
Spargo, Fred Hancock. E. E. Whitney.
W. H. Abrams and J. W. Freeman.
The Grand Jury, called in special
session last evening to investigate elec
tion frauds, came to an abrupt ad
journment after midnight as a result of
a row that arose over an attempt to
indict the Election Commissioners.

GRIND JURORS
ENGAGE IN ROW
Rev. John Williams of Omaha
thought that if the deputy from North .
Carolina was correct in his argument |
as to the marriage vow. the church had
laws as loose as those of South Dakota. \
Â¦ Two â¢ members announced that sinc-e ]
the San Francisco convention three |
years ago tÂ£ev had been converted to |
the side of . those who. oppose the re- j
marriage of divorced iiersons. They Â¦
were E. P. Bailey of Chicago and Rev. j
Dr. Samuel Ringgold of Knoxville. t
Tenn. The church, said Dr. Ringgold. i
has no power to unrnarry and should t
have none to remarry any one.
Rev. G. B. Van Waters of Portland. I
Or., in a fervent address declared that !
the divorce reformers of the church were
requiring more than Christ himself re
quired and that such a canon as the
majority report proposed would drive
persons to other denominations. He ad
vocated letting "well enough alone."
X. H. Battle of RaSeigh. N. C. an
other member of the committee,
thought that no civil court in America
should judge any one to be divorced
unles? the cause appears in the records
and declared that the breaking of a
vow or covenant taken in the marriage
ceremony by one of the principals frees
the other, according to the practice of
common law. He said there was noth
ing In the prayer book to prevent the
remarriage of the innocent person.
The Archbishoo of Canterbury was
present during the debate. The mem
bers of the House of Bishops, in their
individual capacity, have arranged to
present to the Archbishop a mammoth
silver loving cup.
Rev. Dr. Parks, speaking for the
minority members of thecommittee, said
the passage In the nineteenth chapter
of St. Matthew, touching upon mar
riage and divorce, was uncertain. He
thought the common conscience of
America would never accent any such
dictum as that presented in the ma
jority report and said that if a man
had an adulterous spouse no legisla
tion by the church would have any ef
fect in preventing his remarriage if he
so desired.
The committee on canons, of which
Rev. Dr. F. P. Davenport of Memphis,
Tenn.. is chairman, presented an
amendment to the present canon, for
bidding remarriage of any persons who
have been divorced. A minority report,
permitting the present canon to remain
as it is. with the exception of an added
provision for the presentation of court
evidence when an applicant for remar
riage appears before a clergyman, was
submitted by Rev. Dr. J. Lewis Parks
of New York and others.
|
BOSTON. Oct. 11.â A proposed change
in the canons of the Episcopal church, i
whereby clergymen are forbidden to re- ;
marry any person who has been di- 1
vorced. was discussed for two hours by !
the house of deputies at to-day'a seÂ«-'
sion of the Episcopal General Conven- j
tlon. The house of deputies was elt- [
ting as Â¦ committee of the whole and :
the consideration of the subject, re- 1
carded as one of the most important to'
come before the present convention, i
will be taken up from time to time un- !
til the matter is finally disrwsed of.
The present canon on marriage permits
the remarriage of the innocent person -
in a divorce suit wherein infidelity is
alleged. For some time there has been 5
a strong sentiment in the church that!
the clergy should not remarry even the :
innocent person.
WARREXSBURG. Mo., Oct. 1Lâ The
crew of the extra freight train, which
collided with the Missouri Pacific
World's Fair train yesterday, resulting
in the death of twenty-nine persons. Is
held responsible for the disaster by the
Coroner's jury, which returned a ver
dict to-night. The verdict charges the
crew with disobeying orders and with
being asleep at its post of duty. No
recommendation was made as to the
prosecution of the train crew.
County Prosecuting Attorney Morrc-w
said after the Inquest that he would
immediately begin the prosecution of
the persons charged with the respon
sibility of the wreck by the Coroner's
jury.
At the hearing this afternoon. En
gineer Horton of the extra freight ac
km/wledeed that he had mistaken train
No. 50 for the second section of No. 30.
He was positive that four trains east
bound had â *ss=rd and If he was asleep
at any time while the train was on the
siding he did not know of it.
"I was drowsy." he said, "but don't
think I was asleep. If I was asleep I
was sitting straight up in the cab of
my engine." â¢
Following is a list c-f the members of
the freight crew: John D. Horton,
Sedalia, engineer; J. W. Preston, Jef
ferson City? conductor; R. G. Dawson,

Undaunted by the difficulty of the
production. Mr. Lehar brings on the
children, gives them grown-up recita
tives, solos, with choruses for child
companions. Nor is it the Tivoli's way
to be abashed by a little thing of that
sort. The part of the boy Yanku was
sung and acted last night with an even
exquisite naturalness and feeling by
little Harold Forman. whose accom
plishments as a singer rank with those
of the best of the cast. Perhaps
Harold's best bit of acting was the
seriousness with which* he took Papa
Hartman's baritener. Eunice Gilman
was effective though theatrical- as
Suza. the quartet between the two and
Bessie Tannehill and Schuster being
one of the prettiest things of the even-
Ing. . .
Between the .prologue and the first
act twelve years have elapsed. Yanku,
who has left home to se*k his for
tunes as a mousetrap peddler, has be
come the prosperous assistant in a
hardware store and the prospective
son-in-law of its owner. Suza is still
a lowly maid, and comes to town to
seek her soldier lover and to take a
situation as servant girl with Yankus
employer. Miss Edith Mason returns
to take th* grown-up Suza" 3 Dart, and
very charming she is as the pie-tail<?d.
flaxen-haired, simple Dutch madchen.
Thomas H. Persse is th-? Yanku. and
brings a full, smooth and sweet tenor
and a highly agreeable personality to
the part. Kate Condon is cast as the
soldier lover, and looks, sings and acts
handsomely. Miss de Fellippe Is
clever as Tanku's sweetheart, and
Sirams is excellent as the father. Schus
ter's bass looms up nobly. Teddy Webb
has a lively moment, and Bessie Tan
nehill .contributes a capital sketch. But
Hartrnan. in a Hebrew make-uo that
would drive Barney Bernard to drink,
and with. the famous Hartman voice
doing the next thing to grand opera,
is the funniest thing there.
BLANCHE PARTIXGTON.
Like a bit of Vienna looks the cor
ner of Eddy and Mason this week, -with
the "Der Rastelblnder" flaming; under
the Tlvoll sipn. Inside It Is still more
like Vienna, with the fascinating lilt
of Franz Lehar's music waltzing Into
the whistles.
We have had the honor of having
the American premiere cf **Der Rastel
blnder" this week, indeed of hearing
the first performance of the opera in
English. The makers or it grew tired
of hearing its praises tongued in noth
ing but French and German, and Rus
sian, and Italian, and so on. so sent
the opera over here. They probably
knew what they were about In letting
the Tivoll have It. If they did not. WE
know that "Der Rastelbinder's" chances
of American success are as two to one
with a Tivoli introduction. One is
quite sure of getting tte best of the
opera, and one may as well say here
that the best of "Der Rastelblnder" is
something to be grateful for.
Mere in the music than in the story,
though that is of refreshing qualntness.
lies the charm. Mr. Lehar's music is
the prettiest, liveliest, neatest trim
ming to a story made in Germany since
Strauss â who made his in Vienna, to
anticipate the hypercritic.
As with Strauss; Lehar's strength
lies in his waitzy tunes, and these have
the happiness to suggest only their
author. There are some er.chantlngly
pretty duets and trios so rhythmed and
at least half the audience rather
waltzed than walked out last night
humming and whistling the waits
finale.
The story, too strange not to be true
in its chief fact, concerns the betrothal
of two children, Tanku. aged 12. a
mousetrap peddler (rastelblnder). and
Suza. aged S. with the trouble conse
quent upon the two finding forgetful
ness and other loves during their twelve
years of separation. This child be
trothal among mousetrap peddlers La
Slavonia. it seems, is a custom and re
garded as only little less sacred than
marriage.

OAKLAND, Oct. 11. â In, the hear
ing of the suit to stop the operations
of the garbage crematory Attorney
George W. Reed was one of the prin
cipal witnesses on behalf of the cre
matory people. He denied generally
that there was any smell from tlje
% works. Investigation made by him
failed to establish such a claim. John
O'Brien, an engineer at the works,
testified during his examination that
he had been offered $60 to testify
against his employers by a resident in
that neighborhood named Wilkins. The
hearing will go on to-morrow.

CHICAGO, Oct. 11.â Flirting can
be carried out in church to good ad
vantage, according to a statement is
sued by the Rev. M. B. Williams,
chairman of the committee on Sab
bath observance of the Rock River
conference of the Methodist Episcopal
church.
"There is no reason why young peo
ple should not cultivate each other's
acquaintance from behind hymn
books," declared Williams. "We" are
glad to have them come to church on
any pretext. Flirting is as good an
excuse as any. That is how I first be
came interested in the church."
Frivolity during religious service
was, he said, to be expected of Amer
icans. But that some good was ac
complished even under these condi
tions, he declared, ' was indisputable.
"The expectation of 'seeing a young
woman home' has brought many a
boy to church for the first time," he
said. "Amid the lovemaklng there is
a chance for the religious influence to
steal in." ,

will be exemplified before the repre
sentatives. The second or fellowcraft
degree will be presented by Pacific
Lodge to-morrow night.
The Masonic Veterans* Association
will hold a meeting in the temple to
morrow afternoon for the purpose of
electing officers for the ensuing term.
This session will be a very interest
ing one, as probably more business
will be transacted before its close than
has ever before been disposed of by
that body.
The only business transacted yester
day was the presentation of the re
ports of the grand officers, all of which
were referred, with the exception of
that of the grand master, which was
read. This shows a good increase in
the order during the past twelve
months "and a corresponding increase
in finances. He makes a number of
recommendations for the good of the
craft.
The Grand Lodge of the Free and

yesterday, i n the Masonic Temple, in
fifty-fourth annual communication for
the transaction of such business as
may be brought before it. The grand
body has. this year, nearly 600 repre

OAKLAND, Oct. 11.â As the dancing clubs
are organized for the season and social activity
becomes more pronounced, a fact that has been

during the season the bachelors are enter
tained, frequently In an elaborate manner. In
the many delightful homes of this city, and I

the marriage dissolved.
George W. Minifie, a house mover,

he had a mother and sister to support
and left her. She stated she was left

The Kinshui Maru was a Japanese
steamer that plied between Japanese
and Chinese ports, and it is barely pos
sible that she may have had an en
counter with a Russian warship before
succumbing to the elements.
Some hours later, when .the gale had
subsided, the Gotama picked up a life
boat with the, name Kinshut lettered
on her bow. In the boat were five oars,
a number of life preservers and some
castoff clothing.
The little whaling schooner Gotama,
Captain Macombe, came Into port
last night- thirty-six days from the
Island of Kuril off the coast of Korea.
The Gotama brings a story of an ocean
disaster that while meager In its de
tails is sufficiently complete to cause
shivers of horrors to those unused to
ocean tragedies.
On August 1, according to thÂ« report
of Captain Macombe, the Gotama,
while fighting her way through a heavy
gale, encountered a mass of wreckage
from some large ship.
Shortly after the first wreckage, the
master of the Gotama says he saw a
large number of what appeared to be
headless bodies floating in the water.
Owing to the heavy seas and high wind
he was unable to rescue any of the
supposed corpses, but from what he
saw he was satisfied that there were no
survivors of the wrecked vessel.
Councilman Howard, criticizing the
Miller proposition, said he feared that
there was no assurance of a contin
uity of supply. He also suggested that
the city would have to be very careful
not to. run against any Supreme Court
decisions touching the acquisition of
percolating waters.
Miller called attention to the similar
ity of his project to that of Council
man George W. Dornin. except that the
Miller proposition called for the invest
ment of private capital, while Dornin
proposed the city should operate di
rectly. An engineers' rough estimate
fixed the cost of the Miller plan at
$3,450,000. He has asked for a round
$4,000,000 to cover all contingencies and
a contractor's reasonable profit. After
adjournment Dornin said that if the
City Council should adjpt Miller's pro
posal he -would assign the option be
holds on artesian lands to Miller.
Miller explained that he should fol
low, the plan of piping submitted by
City Engineer F. C. Turner, which calls
for a system capable of handling 20,
000.000 gallons a day, with 5.000,000 gal
lons additional in case of fire. Miller
added that his project included supply-
Ing the city with 8000 meters and 500,
00&. feet of service pipe, sufficient to
connect three-fifths of thÂ£; buildings in
Oakland.
My opinion la that the Kilea Cone, so-called.
Is the best and most available source of water
supply for the city of Oakland.
LJKES NILES CONE.
If the city shall accept the proposition it Is
to enter into a contract with me to call a bend
election. If the bonds carry I shall furnish a
suitable bond and guarantee to develop 12,000.
000 gallons a day. If after fifteen day* test
of the wells under municipal supervision that
amount of water is obtained, the construction
of the plant is to begin. The city is to pay 75
per cent of the monthly value of the work done
as it progresses. When the plant is completed
the city -must agree to take possession and for
one year to pump the wells. During that
year the city will retain $750,000 of the con
tract price to ' Insure the permanency of the
supply. If the. supply shall fall to any extent
during the year the contractor shall further
develop the plant until the guaranteed^ mini
mum Is obtained. I agree to protect ths city
to the extent of $50,000 expenses In event of
litigation. The capitalists who are Interested
in this project have been assured that there is
no legal bar against them, so far as taking
the water from the district is concerned.
Responding to an Invitation to out
line his proposition Miller said:
I propose to develop walls In the artesian
district in the southern portion of Alameda
County; to establish necessary, pipelines, pump
ing plant, reservoirs and distributing system
in the city of Oakland sufficient to supply at
least 12,000,000 gallons of water a day, or to
give a population of 160, 000 sufficient water,
on a basis of 73 gallons a day per capita, for
all purposes. The plant la to be absolutely
complete. I propose to deed 450 acres of land
to the city.
The. City Council', to-night requested
M. K. Miller to submit a statement of
his n proposition to develop a supply of
12,000,000 gallons of water a day, and to
Install a complete- system for a muni
cipal water works to' cost thÂ« city
$4,000,000.
This action. followed the presentation
of Miller's plan to the Council.
. Miller, in reply - to questions from
Councilman Cuvellier, said on thi9 sub
ject: _ -
A . development of wells in thÂ« City*! area
would supply a considerable quantity of water.
A sufficient quantity might be developed to
serve as an auxiliary to some other plant. la
my original report on thia subject I said that
a supply for the immediate needs of the city
might be obtained, but. In view of thÂ« growth
of the city, it might not be advisable to depend
entirely on thia source.

Mrs. Isabel C. Barrows, mother of the
gifted young woman who was to stacre
"AJax," denies vehemently that the
postponement is due to her daughter's
illness*. She said to-night: "An injus
tice is done my daughter when it is
made to appear that she is responsible
for the failure to carry out the original
programme In this matter. She is ill.
it is true, with a severe cold, but the
performance was not postponed on
that account. It could have been srlven
on Thursday as well as as
far as she is concerned. We were told,
however, that the weather conditions
were so changing and uncertain that it
would be best to defer the production."
Professor Edward Clapp of the Greek
department does not enter into a con
test with. Mrs. Barrows on the point at
Issue, contenting himself by saying
that a postponement was advisable and
that M.iss Barrows is not. to appear; to
direct the performance on the stage. '
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center street, Oct. 11.
Bliss Mabel May Barrows, who for
nine weeks has superintended the re
hearsals at the university for a mem
orable production of the Greek drama
"AJax," announced to-day that she
is not to appear in the production aa
an actress, nor to direct it from the
stage as originally planned. Illness
is given as the reason for her with
drawal from the undertaking. Inci- '
dentally, the performance is to be post
poned from Thursday to Saturday.
Miss Barrows was to have appeared
as Tecmessa, wife of AJax. Her di- j
rection of the sta,ge effects and speak- j
ing parts was expected to make the
entire performance notable, because of
the experience and skill she would brine
to the task. Her career as a direct
ress of similar performances, under
conditions that gave her unique fame,
was to be supplemented by a triumph
in the fine Greek Theater at the State
University.
There will be no such climax to her
career, for it is positively declared by
all concerned, both the young women
and the university authorities, that she
will have no part in the "Ajax" produc
tion, either as actress, or stage direct
ress.
Official announcement was made bv
the university authorities this after
noon that the "Ajax" performance will
be postponed from next Thursday aft
ernoon to next Saturday morning. The
announcement reads, "Owing to the
serious illness of Miss Barrows." etc..

"This younger and prettier woman
has cheated me of my lawful husband,"
was her lament. "I am his legal wife
and have been trying to compel him to
receive me back in my proper place."
Ampearo has known the woman for
many years, but he says her claims are
groundless. Her trial was set for Oct
ober 19. â¢
The complainant is a rather attrac
tive young woman about 25 years old
and she asserts that fihe can easily
prove her right to bear Ampearo's
name. The other one Is not far from
40 years old and was in a state of ex
treme nervousness when she appeared
before Police Judge Mortimer Smith.
Her story dates from October, 1S94,
when, she asserts, she became Am
pearo's contract wife at Pleasanton.
Oakland OfflcÂ« San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Oct. lL
Two women, Mrs. Bessie Ampearo, a
lodging-house keeper at 1216 Clay
6treet, and Mrs. Kjerstln* Jaeobsen,
aJso claiming the name of Ampearo,
faced each other to-day In the Police
Court, rival claimants to lawful wife
hood with J. B. Ampearo, an engineer.
Each woman was strenuous in her dec
larations. Each was on the verge of
hysteria and one of them, Mrs. Jacob
sen-Ampearo, was borne fainting from
the court room after a trying Bcene.
The rivals were present as prosecutor
and defendant. Mrs. Bessie Ampearo
had caused the other's arrest on a
charge of disturbing the peace. She
declared that the woman accused had
pone to the Clay street home and had
annoyed the landlady by persisting in
her demands to be recognized as Am
pearo's spouse. Bhe had loitered about
the place, gathering flowers and other
wise comporting herself as the mistress
of the dwelling until the other woman
had sent for the police, who arrested
the visitor. Ampearo, to whom appeal
was made for ball, denied the claims
of the unwelcome caller and refused to
have anything to do with her.
The Ampearo couple insist that the
woman Is demented. Mrs. . Bessie Am
pearo tearfully declared that her an
noyer had tried six months ago in San
Francisco to take her belongings to
their home and the annoyer's arrest
followed. The Ampearos said they
tied from San Francisco to Oakland In
an effort to escape the attentions of
the persistent woman. But she was a
nemesis on their trail and bobbed up
with her unceasing pleas for recogni
tion.

HOLLISTER, Oct. 11. â Half an inch
of rain fell here last night, making
2.56 inches for the season. The rain
is a great benefit to the stockmen, as
the feed has got a sufficient start so
that it will not die. Farmers are also
benefited and are commencing to plow.

SAN JOSE, Oct. 11. â The storm of
the last few days has greatly damaged
the late crops of . the valley. The
greatest loss will fall on the grape
crop. Table grapes on the vines are
practically ruined, as the rains have
rendered the bulk of them unfit for
shipment. /Tomatoes, beans and ber
ries have been injured to an extent
that may mean a heavy loss.
Most of the hay is under cover, but
the portion left out of doors will ae
spoiled. The rainfall for twenty-four
hours ending at noon to-day was .92
of an Inch, making 4.93 inches for the
season to date. Last year at this time
only .18 of an inch had fallen.

SANTA MARIA, Oct. 11.â It has

Legislation is recommended increas
ing the allowance to expert riflemen
and marksmen at the , rate "respective
ly of $3, $2 and $1 per month during
each year they qualify.
An increase in the allowance for
commutation for quarters of officers
is recommended.
"A major general's commutation al
lowance of $72," says the paymaster
general, "would not pay the rent of a
modern fiat in any large city, and a
conveniently located and suitable
house would be entirely out of the
question. There is no possibility that
an officer of any grade with a family
can rent a suitable house in such
places as New York, Washington, Chi
cago or San Francisco fox the amount
of his commutation."
"Much complaint has been made by
company commanders of the practice
of money lenders, especially in San
Francisco, who it is believed not only
lean on the security of their deposit
books, but He in wait for them when
discharged, and confiscate or extort
a large percentage of. what is due them
from the Government. The evil is a
crying one, and clearly akin to that
which exists in any large seaport,
where seamen are stripped of their
hard-earned money by boarding-house
runners and touts. If the deposit book
can be made without value in case of
such use, it will be of benefit to the
service as well as to the soldier."
WASHINGTON, Oct. 11. â Brigadier
General F. S. Dodge, paymaster gen
eral of the army, in his annual report,
recommends legislation, if possible, to
the end that soldiers' deposit books
should not be sold, pledged, assigned
or transferred except after a discharge
and when accompanied by the soldier's
final statement, and that such disposi
tion shall be made a military offense
for which the soldier may be retained
in the service for trial. He recom
mends that the possession of a soldier's
deposit bok by any person as security
for a loan to the soldier during the
period of his service shall worK a for
feiture of such deposits. The paymas
ter general says:
The Government will perfect an appeal-Im
mediately In the Benson case, and under the
order of Juris** Lacombe Benson will be held
under ball to await the result of the appeal.
The 'appeal in the Hyde-Dimonil case will
be pressed to a hearing by the Government at
the earliest date possible berore the Supreme
Court of the United , State*, and the decision
of the court will be conclusive- In both caeca.
The questions decided In the Benson case and
in the Hyde-Dlmond case are not involved In
the Orescn land fraud cases, and these de
cisions, therefore, have no bearing whatever
upon them.
Immediately thereafter the defendants, Hyde
and Dimond, sued out a writ of habeas corpus
before the Circuit Court for the Ninth Circuit
of the United States, W. W. Morrow presid
ing, and that court, after full argument and
with the opinions of Judfre Lacombe and Judge
de Haven before it, held that the facts ren
dered by Judse Lacombe and narrated in the
same Indictment, do constitute an offense
against the United States under that statute,
and refused to discharge the prisoners, and the
defendants Hyde and' Dimond thereupon per
fected an appeal to the Supreme Court of the
Untt'd States and that appeal Is now pending.
Judpe Lacombe had entered his order, dis
charging Benson, and the Government there
upon concluded to petition for a rehearing in
that case, and Judge Lacorr.be simply declined
to grant the rehearing and adhered to hiÂ» orig
inal opinion, with the suggestion that the best
way to settle the differences of view between
himself and the two United States Judges In
California iÂ« to permit the appellate court to
determine the question. Â¦
WASHINGTON, Oct. 11. â Secretary
Hitchcock made the following state
ment to-day in connection with the
disposition of the Benson land fraud
case in New York:
The action of Judne Lacombe of New York
yesterday, in refusing to grant a rehearing
upon his original decision In the Benson case,
does not materially affect the position or in
terest* of the Government In the California
land fraud cases. Alter Judge Lacombe ren
dered his original decision, discharging Ben
eon upon habeas corpus on the ground that
the facts narrated In the Indictment do not
constitute an offense against the United States
under section 5440 of the Revised Statutes of
the United States, the United States District
Court for the Northern District of California,
John J. de Haven presiding, after full argu
ment on the question and with Judge La
combe's CDinlon before it. decided that tho
lac-ts referred to by Judge Lacombe and nar
rated In the same Indictment, do constitute an
offense against the United states under that
statute, and granted a warrant of removal as
against lien&Gn'a co-defendants, Hyde and Dl
rr.ond. who had been arrested In San Fran
cisco.
There has not been a good soaking
of the ground since 1890. and present
indications are that the soil will be in
better condition for next year's crops
than for fourteen years past. These
early rains sprout the weeds, which,
being plowed under, will also help
to produce cleaner grain and beans
than the average. Feed is abundant,
being from six to ten inches high.

when the present storm began, the
rain has been falling intermittently un

it became continuous. Duriijg four
hours .76 of an inch fell, bringing the
season's precipitation up to 2.89 inches
as against .19 on the same date last

PORTLAND, Ore., Oct. 11.â While
Charles W. Walton, the 18-year-old
San Francisco boy in jail awaiting
trial for holding up a street car, played
.his mandolin to drown the sounds, the
other prisoners in the County Jail last
night sawed through the bars of their
cells. The riot was to send Martin
V. Leasia, who awaits the decision of
the Supreme Court on a murder
charge, to the telephone. â¢ He was to
open the door of the jailer's room.
Leasia was allowed to use the tele
phone by Jailer Grafton, who was then
told of the plot to murder him. A Dep
uty Sheriff entered the jail at that mo
ment, and together they made an in
vestigation. John Sullivan, in jail for
highway robbery, was declared to be
the ringleader. After all the prison
ers had apparently been overpowered
Sullivan made a desperate attack
upon the jailer, whose hand was
broken in the hand to hand fight
which followed.

EL PASO, Tex., Oct. 11. â The flood
situation is improving but little. The
Southern Pacific is now able to run
trains through to California ,and the

Mexican Central will also have trains
through by to-morrow. The Santa Fe

VENTURA, Oct. 11. â Lima beans are
gilt-edge property Just now and a lot
of Ventura farmers are going to make
fortunes this season. Llmas have
Jumped from $3 50 before the rain to
four cents per pound. To-day San
Franciscans procured two carloads at
the latter figure.
When It Is considered that lima rais
ing will pay at two and a half cents, it
will be readily seen where the farmers
will profit. The advance, which, It, is
said, will be still greater, is brought
about by the fact that a threatened
short crop has been still further re
duced by the recent rains catching in
the fields one- fifth of the crop un
threshed, much of which will be ruined.
The moving picture exhibition,
showing scenes In Portugal and the
Arore Islands, which was postponed
last night on account of the rain, was

ADVEKTISE3IENTS.
ON THE SAFETY OF OVER-
EATING.
The Rule of Choosing the Ijesscr of
Two Evils Applies to the
Way You Eat.
I want to knew how a man is to
know when he has had enough.
The Pilgrim Fathers, I believe, had
a quaint saying to the effect th-* you
should always rise from the table feel-
ing: as if you could eat some more.
But the question is, hew much more?
Just when to stop?
That's the point.
The rule is wrong, because it is no
rule at all.
It is inexact and unscientific
It is likily to lead to the dangerous
habit of eating too 1I **'e.
And eating too little â or digesting too
little, which amounts to the same thing
âia the cause of nine-tenths -f the dis-
?"apes from which humanity suffers to-
day.
What is disease?
It is simply uneven balance between
waste and repair.
Borne organ lacks strength to carry
on the special work for which it was
created.
Where shall it find the strength it
lacks?
In crugs?
Ten thousand times, N'O!
Better die than become a hopeless
drug fiend.
No; in food.
"But," you say. "I eat a plenty ot
pood food every day!"
True, dear friend; but you don't dl-
cest lt.
And food, undigested. Is mere poi-
son.
Bo, to make food do you good, you
must take Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.
The great thing about Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets is that their action does
cot depend upon stimulative druggery.
They cannot create a habit-
They contain no ingredients to "pick
you up," "tone up your nervous sys-
tem" ot furnish whip energy, by calling
out your vital reserve force.
They create new strength, force and
energy â out of jour food.
If taken starving, they will do you
no good at all.
So, eat to live and live to eat with
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.
The curse of our present civilization
Is exhaustion.
And exhaustion, whether of brain,
nerves, physical strength or vital force,
is caused by starvation.
Of two evils, it is better to overeat
'and prevent indigestion with Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets) than to rise from
the table not having eaten enough to
repair the exhaustion of your vital
forces.
For exhaustion or starvation leads to
the most varied forms of s'ekness or
disease, brought on by inability of the
weakened vitality to counteract the
diseaseâ poisons and microbes.
"Whereas, the well-fed and well-nour-
ished person, withc-ut ever feeling the
worse for it, can expose himself, to dan-
pers. the mere thought of which would
drive the weak, starveling dyspeptic
!nto a nanSc fit.
Good Vood. well digested, is the great
secret of a healthful existence here on
earth.
So eat heartily, every day. of the best
food you can get and regulate the
r working of your digestive machinery
with Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.
As a result, you will be astonished to
find how much stronger and livelier you
feel, how much more and better work
you can do, how much more pleasure
you will get out of life and how your"
old enemy, that chronic trouble which
has fastened upon your weak spot,
wherever it is. will up and away and
pver after leave you In peace, health
and comfort.
There's more truth than poetry In all
this.

NEW YORK, Oct. 11. â The sale of
the great Whitney stud was concluded
in Madison-square Garden to-night in
the presence of- 6000 spectators. Fifty
head of horses brought $238,000, or
a grand total of $4 63,550 for the sale
of ninety-one head. The average price
was $5096.
Meddler, the champion stallion, was
knocked down to Matthew Corbett for
$51,000. Mr. Corbett. in spite of ru
mors that he had purchased the fa
mous sire for Clarence H. Mackay, de
clared he had purchased him solely in
his own interests. After the sale he
asked Harry Payne Whitney to allow
Meddler to go back to Brookdale farm
for a few days until he could make
other arrangements.
James R. Keene, who went as high
as $49,500 for Meddler, said that Cor
bett did not buy the stallion for him,
although many believed prior to this
statement that Mr. Corbett, who has
been running a number of the Keene
horses in his name this season, was
acting for the millionaire. Corbett
is a millionaire turfman himself, and
said several days ago that he would
like,.' to secure Meddler if only for
speculation. Harry Payne Whitney
also declared that Mr. Corbett did not
act for him. Trainer John W. Rogers
evidently felt disappointed over the
fact that Meddler was not retained
by Mr. Whitney.
Meddler was originally owned by
George Abingdon Baird, the English
millionaire, and when the Baird
horses were sold after their owner's
death Meddler was bid in for $73,500
by J. Malcolm Forbes of Boston. At
the latter's death he was bid in â¢ by
Sydney Paget, acting for Mr. Whit
ney, for $49,000.
Of the remaining stallions in. the
Whitney stud Ballyhoo Bey went to
Harry Payne Whitney for $25,000, and
Yankee was 'bought Â¦ by" WV/H. Jen~
nings for $21,500. Other sales 'of
$10,000 or more were:

DELMAR ENTRIES.
The members of the San Francisco
Model Yacht Club will hold an Impor
tant meeting to-night. The protect of
Secretary Genung, which is two-fold,
will be heard at the meeting. It is in
regard to the races for the Todd cup
held a week ago Sunday. The first part
of the protest pertains to the time
limit. According to the official timer
the length of the course is 650 feet, but
Genung figures it is nearer 700 feet.
Under the rules of the club the time
limit for 1000 feet is 10 minutes. This
â¢would make the time limit for a 650
foot course 6:30. In the races held on
October 2, Genung's Witch negotiated
the course in 6:35 and thus failed to
qualify. Genung claims the course
measures at least 670 feet, in which
case the Witch would have been within
the time limit.
The other ground of the protest is
that the preliminary races were not
held according to the rules governing
cup races.
Three boats have qualified for the
finals, which are scheduled to be sailed
on Sunday. They are the Santee, owned
by Todd and Adams; Piute, owned by
O. M. Forrest, and Apache, owned by
William Roeckner.
Theodore Martenstein's new scow will
be tried out on the first Sunday that
the wind is good. When she was
launched about a month ago there was
ncr wind and no line could be got on
her speed.
B. Jurgens is building a new scow.
He has been successful in the past with
his models and the new boat should
prove fast.

DELMAR SELECTIONS,
At last night's practice Thompson
who has been playing tackle on the
varsity, severely wrenched his ankle
The injury is severe enough to keep
him out of the same for a week.
In lieu of a game with another pre
paratory school team the freshmen
lined up against the second varsity
team this afternoon. The work of the
baby eleven shows considerable Im
provement over previous form. By
the end of the week they will be in
good shape for the freshmen game
with California.

Seattle Game Postponed.
SEATTLE, Oct. 11. â The Seattle-
Los Angeles game -was postponed en
account of rain.
Developments are slow in the Britt-
Gans contest, which is less than three
weeks off. That the men have signed
articles to do battle for the lightweight
championship of the world is known,
but that is about all. Some of the box
ing enthusiasts seem interested: oth
ers simply nod, while there are others
who have not realized that the men
have signified their intention of taking
punches at each other.
It was expected that the forfeits oÂ£
the two men would be safely depos
ited in. the hands of Harry Corbett,
the official stakeholder, yesterday, but
such was not the case. Neither man
showed the color of his money. A. Her
ford promised last night to deposit his
money this afternoon and Jimmy Brilt
made a like assertion. When the money
is up, it may pave the way for a little
more enthusiasm.
According to present indications the
dark-hued lad from Baltimore will be
a big favorite with that element
which likes to risk its good money on
the outcome of pugilistic struggles.
Some suggest that Gans will sell at 2
to 1; others think 10 to 6 looks good,
while there are some who are of the
opinion that 10 to 7 or 8 will be the
prevailing odds. Many shrewd bettors
look for the fight to end in a draw.
The question of a permit still hangs
in midair and causes all kinds of talk
along the Rialto. Manager Coffroth is
sanguine of landing the permit. He as
sures the anxious ones that the fleht
will be decided in the Mechanics' Pa
vilion on the night stipulated in the
articles, and of course the principals
can ask no more. Then there are oth
ers who are bold enough to say that
Mr. Coffroth will never have a peeo in
at that permit. The only gentlemen to
settle this little matter are the Super
visors, and when they take action the
aspect of the situation may change.
Gans will repair to Billy Shannon's
villa, near San Rafael, to-day, there
to make ready for the coming struggle.
As usual, he will have Kid Sullivan as
sparring partner, assisted by other les
ser lights of the ring. Al Herford will
personally look after the training of
the champion. Herford says Gans will
make the weight without any trouble
and be strong enough to go fifty
rounds. /
Britt thinks the soft sea breezes will
be just about right this time and there
fore he has selected the Seal Rook
House as his training-place. On Mon
day James expects to be ready to work
out. The breach between himself and
Spider Kelly having been healed, the
latter will be much in evidence as the
general manager of the Californian's
training. Frank, Rafael and a few oth
ers who are handy will don the mitts
with Jimmy when he feels Inclined to
go a few rounds.

When Champion James Jeffries visit
ed the Russian cruiser Lena at Mare
Island last Thursday the vessel was
not only his (that is, what is left of
it on board), but Captain Berlinsky,
all the officers and every Jack-tarsky
that could get near enough to gaze
his adoring soul out at the mighty
fistic warrior, belonged to the terrible
guest. When the vodka, the brandy
and other strong liquids which the cor
dial Russian host delights to pour out
in smoking libations to the honor of
the illustrious stranger within his
gates, began to flow holy Russia, the
Czar, the Czarina and the brand new
royal baby were Jim's also.
They had all seen Jim at his show
in the Vallejo Theater and though they
had never heard of Davy Crockett or
his immortal motto and could not pos
sibly measure the quality of the per
formance, they knew the one they
cared only to know. The fierce set-tos
in the corners of the play were the
only fighting they had witnessed since
the merciless Japanese fleets dropped
hull down below the horizon in the
blood stained Eastern seas, and their
poor, crippled ship was hitting the tips
of the waves for San Francisco.
So when Jeffries visited the Lena he
received an ovation from the Russians
that by right should be accorded only
to their imperial master. In fact, if
they ever get back to Russia they may
all find the Siberian salt mines on
charges of disloyalty and treason to
the Emperor. They stood him up be
fore the picture of the Czar in the
wardroom and noted with pride how
much bigger a man Jim Is than Nich
olas. Sailorlike they lashed the Jeff
ries and Romanoff races together, as it
were, and toasted the two royal fam
ilies in vodka till only the absence of
Peter the Great's old imperial head
gear kept them from crowning James
then and there. They made the guest
drink with them to himself till he ab
sorbed the idea that he was the Em
peror.
One officer stood Jim and Captain
Berlinsky alongside of one another and
in his official French-English said:
"Behold! Here ees zee grat men of zee
â what you call â ah, zee vorl! Grat?
Grater, I speak, zan efryting. Behold
zee General Jeffries and Capta'n Ber
linsky. Zee General he fight zee gran'
battal wiz hees hans â biff, boom, an'
he keel 'em all. Zee Capta'n Berlinsky,
he also grat. He fight wiz hees guns
an' he keel 'em all, too. Behold!"
Then the captain hugged the gener
al and all the bearded naval warriors
of the Czar fell on the guest and kissed
him in their fervent Russian way till
the general's smooth cheeks, tender
from the stage grease paint he daubs
on every night to make himself look
like Davy Crockett, were blood-red
from the whisker scratches- Somebody
rescued Jim from his too ardent
friends and helped him down the gang
way, and a steam launch got him over
to 'Georgia street wharf in safety.

Drake deprived Morris Park bookmak- I

CHICAGO, Oct. 11.â Horsemen are a
unit in their declaration that Big Ben
is a speed marvel. With 123 pounds on
his back in the third and feature event
at Worth to-day he took all the fast
sprinters into camp. As in former
events he won as he pleased, with a
good length to spare over Floral King
and Nannie Hodge. Don Domo, the
"gray streak," was beaten off.
Mont Tennes, who recently purchased
the big son of Ben Strome-Mint Julep
and won him out in his last start,
would not believe that Big Ben could
give away so much weight and defeat
these sprinters, so he allowed him to
run for the purse and did not back him.
On that account the odds on Big Ben
went uo from even money to 3 to 2,
which was considered out of line by
many who profited well on his victory.
Floral King rushed to the front at
the start, taking a lead of two lengths,
with Nannie Hodge second and Big
Ben third, close up. Turning into the
stretch Big Ben rushed into the lead
and Nannie Hodge also closed strongly.
Prior then called upon Big Ben and he
drew away and won easily by a length.
Floral King easily beat Nannie Hodge
a length and a half for the place.
The track was fast and the weather
cloudy and threatening. Summary:

1 Neither the Seals nor the Commut
ers had any license to call yesterday 8
game at Idora Park their own. No
runs were earned and, properly, they
should have been playing yet. But
the errors broke in when they counted
most. By this means the Commuters
managed to stow away a pair of runs
[while the best the Seals got was an
The field, was wet and slippery after
the rain and consequently the fielders
could not be blamed for some of the
misplays. The ones that did the most
1 damage were overthrows to the oui
fleid â errors that could have been pre
vented, especially as most of them
were made on easy chances.
Both Buchanan and Barber naa
everything that goes to fool the oppos
ing batsmen. Neither had a single
bad inning. In point of control, speed
and nerve the work of both men was
about on a par. Only nine hits were
torn off by both teams â five by the
Seals and four by the Commuters.
Strange to say, there was not a single
1 long drive in the game.
The Seals got a good start, yet they
could not make good with a run. van
Buren was passed and Hildebrand hit
to the outfield. Then with two down
Buchanan advanced both men with a
wild pitch. The next batter fell an
easy victim to the twisters of the star
Oaklander and so it was all over in a
twinkling.
The Commuters were unable to get
a look in at the run column till the
third. Then Buchanan pasted one to
the outfield and Ganley flew to Meany.
Francks laid down a grounder to
short. Gochnauer, in his efforts to
complete a double play, threw the ball
away at second, leaving both runners
safe. Dunleavy had a long fly which
advanced Buchanan a peg and he reg
istered after Schlafley unloaded a
wicked drive over Van Buren's head.
Oakland held this lead of a run till
the eighth, when Buchanan gave the
Seals a chance by fumbling Gortons
grounder. Barber laid down a bunt
and Van Buren kicked through with
one over third, sending Gorton to
sack three. Hildebrand popped up a
hard foul which Stark managed to get.
He was so elated over this piece of
work that he winged the sphere down
to second in an attempt to nail Van.
The ball went to he outfield and Gor
ton sneaked in with the lone Seal
mark.
Oakland enticed the winning one
over the pan in the eighth on an er
ratic mixup. With one gone Dunleavy
was given a chance on Gochnauer'a
bad throw to first. He went down and
Schlafley hiked. Kruger produced a
simple one to Barber, who threw to
third and headed off Dun. Cap was
anxious for a double play and he
winged across the lot to Van Buren.
The lanky kid let the leather roll to
the outfield and Schlafley came tear
ing in from second. Van might have
nailed him at the plate, but he fool
ishly winged the leather to second.

HARBOR NEEDS
IMPROVEMENTS
Passage of Bond ilsue for
Extension of Seawall Is
of Importance to State
The harbor and shipping committee
of the commercial organizations of San
Francisco is working earnestly to in
terest the State's voters in the pro
posed plan of issuing bonds to the ex
tent of $2,000,000 for the improvement
of the water front. The business men
of the city â¢ say that additional facili
ties for handling the rapidly increasing
traffic of the port are absolutely neces
sary. The issuance of the bonds by
the State will in reality be but a loan,
which will be repaid from the revenue
accruing from port charges.
With the $2,000,000 desired the Harbor
Commission can extend the seawall
4400 feet and construct thirteen modern
piers to replace the present dilapidated
bulkheads, the maintenance of which
is expensive and generally unsatisfac
tory. The improvements will bring in
approximately $60,000 a year.
The committee which is conducting
the campaign for the bond issue wishes
to impress the public with the fact that
the present insufficient dock and wharf
facilities are hampering the shipping
and commerce of San Francisco, which
should be a doubly important trade
center since the acquisition of the
Philippines and the decision of the
Government to construct the Panama
Canal. If the seawall is extended as
planned, merchandise and products can
be handled more cheaply and more
quickly than before.
When conditions are more satisfac
tory, the trading vessels of the Pacific
will come to San Francisco rather than
to other ports, thus enabling the fruit
men and farmers to find new markets
for their products. It is said, also> # ln
this connection that if the city does riot
offer adequate facilities for handling
freight to the ocean trade other ports
will do so to the detriment of San
Francisco. *

MOTHER SUES SHIP OWNER
FOR HEAVY DAMAGES
She Alleges That Her Son Was Killed
on Bnrk Reaper Because of
Owner's Negligence.
Josephina Olsson filed suit in the
United States District Court yesterday
against A. P. Lorentzen, managing
owner of the American bark Reaper,
to recover $10,000 damages for the
death of her son. Charles S. Olsson.
The complaint recites that Charles
fell from the rigging . to the deck on
October 4, 1903, while the ship was
lying In Oakland harbor, and that his
fall was caused by the parting of cer
tain ratlines and seizings that had
become rotten and unsafe by reason
of the; negligence of the owner of tho

So dark was the night and so gable
were; the skin and raiment of Edmund
Richardson that when he stood ; in
Bartlett alley, after emerging from a
Chinese lottery place, two police
men passed within a yard of where he
stood without perceiving him and his
chance of escape seemed excellent when
a third officer stumbled .against him.
When arraigned in Judge Mogan's
court on .the charge of having lottery
tickets in j his possession j Mr. Richard
son fairly; gloomed the environing at
mosphere and when he explained that
the tickets were not his property, but
Lulu Melton, convicted of vagrancy,
expressed a hope that Judge '., Mogan
would not sentence her to a term of
Imprisonment exceeding twenty-four
hours and it was Bailiff Hickey who
opined In muffled tone that she would
"linger longer, Lulu."
Herman Mitchell, professional mes
srnger boy. falteringly testified that he
was running â actually running â when
he slipped and fell through a front
window in the second-hand furniture
store of A. Lichtenstein, 1004 Howard
street. He subesequently qualified
the startling statement to some extent,
however, oy remarking that rain was
.heavily tailing at the time and that his
haste was inspired by anxiety lest his
official uniform might be permanently
damaged by saturation.
Judge Mogan dismissed the case af
ter he ascertained that the lad had not
been given into custody until he had
refused to entertain various proposals
of settlement from Mr. Lichtenstein,
whose first figure of $10 gradually
shrunk to $1 50 ere he decided to
prosecute to the bitter end. .
Nicholas Morris, vegetable peddler,
silently wept as he paid the fine of $10
imposed by Judge Mogan as* penalty
for working a horse which the com
plaining offlcer flippantly likened unto
"an animated hat rack," so knobby
was its exterior. â¢ And when His Hon
or ordered the unfortunate animal to
instant execution the defendant boo
hooed loudly and declared that he
would be ruined financially by the
proposed deprivation.
"I can't help that," was thje court's
unsympathetic comment. "If you are
unable to obtain a livelihood without
practicing cruelty to dumb ' animals
you, too, would be better dead."
Because the Insanity Comissioners
could not find formal complaint
against Joe Mulhatton, remanded for
investigation as to his mental state by
Judge Mogan, they declined to exam
ine him and he was returned to the
Police Court. Two reputable citizens
who have known the man for years
testified that they considered him de
mented, and as the circumstances of
the alleged theft for which he was
arrested point to the same conclusion
he will probably be dismissed to-day.
He took from a Clay street lodging
house an almost worthless coat and
left in its place his own garment con
taining letters addressed to him.
May Macdonald, a young matron,
did not seem to regard with due. se
riousness her arrest for associating
with inmates of a disorderly house on
Howard street and allowing them to
have custody of her 3-year-old daugh
ter. She treated the matter flippantly
when interrogated by Judge Mogan,
and insinuated that as a married wom
an she was privileged to do as she
liked in the way of training her off
spring. His Honor, however, disil
lusioned her to the extent of announc
ing that she would be held in custody
until provision is made for the child's
pioper upbringing.
Judge Conlan again continued the
case of Dr. Thomas F. Brennan, ac
cused of stealing $37,000 from the Rev.
Father Grey tvhlle serving as his.medi
cal adviser, and intimated that he will
hold the defendant for trial in the Su
perior Court. The continuance was or
dered In order to give the defense time
to prepare bonds and appeal papers.
â¢ â¢ â¢
And if a look could have annihilated
the indiscreet attorney he would have
perished on the spot.
When the court continued the case
for thirty days in order to give the de
fendant opportunity to prove by good
behavior that she was not deserving of
punishment, the attorney for the de
fense applied for a warrant charging
Mrs. and Miss Neall and Mr.* Jones
with disturbing the peace of his client.
"I won't sign any such warrant," ex
claimed the Judge. "This court pro
poses to preserve its dignity, to say
nothing of its reason. These people
are worse than the Russians and the
Japs, who evidently have some reason
for fighting each other. Next case, Mr.
Clerk."
Mrs. Neall and her cohorts averred
that Mrs. Weirmann distressed the
neighborhood by her disorderly conduct.
She frequently and cruelly beat her hus
band, a small and meek-tempered man,
they swore, and never missed an oppor
tunity to hurl uncomplimentary re
marks at any one who criticized her
unseemly behavior. To such extent did
she carry her offending of Mrs. Neall
that it was absolutely impossible for
that most amiable lady to maintain
her self-esteem and refrain from so
liciting the law's protection. She (Mrs.
Neall) had suffered and borne in
silence what a person of less pacific
inclination would have revolted against
weeks â aye, months â ago.
Mrs. Weirmann and her contingent,
on the other hand, alleged that the
Nealls, mother and daughter, and their
lodger, Harry Jones, combined to make
life an unendurable burden for the
WeirmannsT They had "chucked" coal
at Mrs. Weirmann as she was pursuing
her domestic tasks in the yard of her
dwelling and they had cut her clothe3
line and also threatened to continue
their persecution until it forced her to
leave the street.
Of course the foregoing accusations
were vigorously denied by those
against whom they were made, but the
proceedings were comparatively tame
until the counsel for the defense asked
a witness, Mrs. Ellen Harrington, to
state her age. She promptly answered
that her age was none of his business,
and the Judge approved the answer
and marveled at the man's temerity in
asking such a question. Thus en
couraged, Mrs. Harrington scornfully
eyed her interrogator and exclaimed:
"The ide-ah! The ver-ray ide-ah!
That Dutchman asking me my age!
The ide-ah!" â¢
Mrs. Clara Neall and Mrs. Julia
Weirmann, next-door neighbors on
Mary street, "had it out" yesterday
morning in the courtroom of Police
Judge Cabaniss. It was a peace dis
turbance case, with Mrs. Neall as com
plainant and Mrs. Weirmann as de
fendant, and each of the ladies was
aided by an eloquent lawyer and
abetted by a crowd I of sympathizing
witnesses.
Dentist M. E. Smith, arrested for
recklessly firing his pistol on the Ocean
Beach last Sunday, was dismissed by
Judge Mogan. Mr. and Mrs. Barker,
who complained that a bullet fired by
the tooth expert had narrowly missed
their heads as they, sat communing
with Neptune, were in court when the
dismissal was ordered and seemed to be
somewhat dissatisfied with the outcome
of their relentless prosecution of the
case. The defendant proved pretty
thoroughly that he did not know there
was a human being within range when
he pulled theMrigger.
John Dowling, hackman, and John
Pulce, bartender, were discussing the
relative fistic merits of Joseph Gans
and James Edward Britt when Mr.
Dowling abruptly closed the argument
by punching Mr. Pulce's right eye, for
which offense Mr. Dowling was arrest
ed and charged with battery. In the
court of Judge Mogan there was such
evident reluctance on the part of Mr.
Pulce to push his complaint that the
case was cast out and then Mr. Pulce
and Mr. Dowling cordially shook hands
and walked away together.
Harry Cooper and James Joseph,
young fellows who stole cigars and
liquors from Henry Bullwinkle's gro
cery on | Polk street, were sen
tenced to six months' imprisonment by
Judge Mogan.

But the amount of this sort of thing
which is done daily Is appalling. So
ciety is pleasant to us all, if it means
having fr*iends and the interchange of
courtesy which is natural among
friends. But society in the sense of
trying to see how many well-known
people we can know, how many teas
and affairs of various kinds we can
attend, involves all sorts of tricks
and subterfuges which are not elevat
ing. In this excellent essay the writer
dwells upon the real things of society,
which are friendship, affection, cour

SOME amount of public co-operation may well be invited to
check a trade evil which is now assuming measurable propor
tions. We refer to the expedient of imitating the distinguishing
features of some successful commodity with a view of deceiving
customers into the purchase of articles other than those which they
had intended to purchase.
It is hard to imagine a greater commercial injustice than that
an honest producer or manufacturer should be thus deprived of the
well earned fruits of the industry, skill and excellence which have
gradually won a position of public approval. Offenders in this re
spect are usually well versed in the art of keeping themselves just
within the pale of the law, but the public, by the exercise of a
greater care and observation, can not only secure substantial justice
for those who have merited their support, but they can also protect
themselves against imitations which, because they are imitations,'are
presumably inferior. ; *- ;
A TRADE EVIL.
5 HERE is a very excellent short
essay in a recent quarterly pub
lication on the subject of good
society. Now, of course, there
Is Â»a wide distinction between so
ciety and good society, which distinc
tion is often overlooked in these lat
ter days. The amount of bitter feel
ing engendered by the strife which so
ciety involves often makes life a very
sad thing for persons who ought to
be happy, says a writer In the St. Paul
Globe. A few quotations from the
article may be of interest:. "It is the
firm grip, the upright carriage, the
steady eye, the responslye smile â
these things and their kindred that
speak for social distinction. And,
above all, it is the little acts" t of
thoughtfulness, the evidences of ca'th
ollc sympathies, the tokens of an un
selfish and loving, nature, that mark
the true aristocrat in human society."

WOMAN AND GOOD SOCIETY
THE city of Oakland is in the slough of despond since the people
refused to have parks, boulevards, sewers, a city wharf and de
cent city buildings. It is a hard case, and the progressive folks
over there have our sympathy, as they had our support in trying to
do better. Their despondency would be -increased if they could see
the comments of the Eastern press on their failure to advance up to
modern requirements.
In their despair they are now proposing to annex Oakland to
San Francisco. To this we object. If the progressive element only
could come under the glad wing of this city's enterprise, those who
compose it would be welcome. But we object to reinforcing our own
mossbacks with the Oakland contingent that has just voted down a
Polytechnic high school and other much needed improvements. We
fear they would want to rent Golden Gate Park for a hog pasture and
turn the Hall of Justice into an apartment house. We would rather

ANNEXATION IN OAKLAND.
the ultimate specialized needs of young and immature children is
obviously impossible, however much we might wish to equip each
one with the precise selection of intellectual tools which he will
eventually need. The best that we can do is to see that all children
are adequately furnished with the groundwork of knowledge which
all are certain to require and in this way to allow other branches of
learning to sprout at will from a healthy and well nourished stem.
We shall perhaps ultimately recognize that the object of the
school is not so much to furnish knowledge as to create or call
forth the love of knowledge. The mere acquisition of facts is a very
small matter compared with the general mental attitude which the
school can give and which once obtained will remain a life-long
possession, an intellectual asset to which all other things will be
added. This is perhaps only another way of saying that the forma
tion of character is the greatest gift which the school can confer, be
cause it implies not merely the certainty "of a constantly increasing
and comprehensive knowlelge, but also all those faculties which
guarantee success in the coming struggle of life. It is a noteworthy
fact that a very large proportion of the world's greatest men have
been by no means noted for their learning, but without exception
they have all been distinguished by dominant and determined char
acter, which brings with it a knowledge of human nature and an
adaptability to circumstances, which is education in its highest
sense.
r T~* HE quality and substance of the education which is being given
I to our children is likely to occupy a permanent position upon
the field of friendly debate so long as we recognize it to be
the factor which it unquestionably is in the future success and prog
ress of the nation. America is one of the few countries of the
world wherein education is not regarded as a subject for the display
ot charity, one of the very few countries which heartily and en
thusiastically recognizes it as an essential to national progress and
preservation. America educates her children not alone because it is
due to them to be educated, but because it is due to herself to have
them educated.
There are of course very many educational problems which
present themselves from time to time and about which marked dif
ferences of opinion are likely to prevail. A nation's activity covers
a very vast field, and the educational implements which are essen
tial to one individual may be entirelv useless to another. To discern
THE PROBLEM OF EDUCATION.
With this high conception of the judicial office, The Call advises
the election of Superior Judges Scawell, Murasky, Kerrigan and
Troutt. They have been named by various party conventions, which
is made necessary by our election laws, but we invite for them the
united support of our citizens, without regard to what political body
named them, or any of them.
San Francisco has the opportunity now, by taking the course
which we advise, to take our judiciary out of party politics, and
should take advantage of it. The opportunity arises in the learning,
impartiality and high judicial character of the four gentlemen we
have named. Lawyers and laymen should join in their support, re
warding the merit of past good service, and securing for the city
a sound and able bench.
AN able and independent judiciary is the sole safeguard of all
rights, and the conservator of public order and peace. The
election of such a judiciary far transcends any political or party
interest. There is no politics, no partisanship in the law, which all
make and all must obey. Therefore there should be no politics and
no partisanship in the election of the judges who administer the law.
They should be spared the necessity of feeling the slightest alle
giance to any party, and their obligation should run equally to every
member of the community, to be discharged only by the impartial
administration of the law. ,

influenced by, one's chance circum
stances, or upon what one has or does.
And this kind of good society Is pos

North Goes on Vacation!
United States Commissioner North
has' gone on a vacation, and Charles
Mehan. recently appointed head . of
the Chinese Bureau, will act as chief
of the Immigrrant Bureau. during >Jr.
North's absence. Dr. John EndScott
Gardiner will act as chief of the Chi
nese Bureau. The Federal Govern
ment has adopted officially a Chinese
calendar prepared by Dr. Gardiner.
It covers a period of sixty-five years,
from 1S49 to 1914. and was compiled
at the reauest of Commissioner Gen
eral Sargent.
California fruit growers may, accord
ing to information that has been re
ceived by the Horticultural Commis
sioner of California, be greatly bene
fited, to the amount of many thousands
of dollars, by a proposed move in Ha
waii to shut out fruits from portions of
the world where insects dangerous to
vegetation infest trees and fruit. This
will compel purchases here. Alexander
Craw, who is now the Hawaiian super
intendent of entomology, has recom
mended to the Board of Commissioners
of Agriculture and Forestry that all
fruits from China, Japan and other
Asiatic points shall be denied entrance
into Hawaii. *-
The dreaded fruit fly abounds in
these places. These flies belong to the
same family as the ! melon-cucumber
fly, against which California has quar
antined. So great have been the rav
ages of the fruit flies that in Queens
land and Western Australia fruit can
hardly be raised. In Cape Colony,
South Africa, fruit trees must be cov
ered with mosquito netting* to enable
the horticulturists to raise a crop.
This makes fruit growing a very ex
pensive business, even where the Gov
ernment buys the netting and furnishes
it to the farmers free of cost to them.
Importations of fruit from China and
Japan have recently been received at
Honolulu in which also were contained
the larvae of the Chinese fruit moth.
Lorlne Club Scores Success.
The first concert of the twenty
eighth season of the Loring Club was
given at Native Sons' Hall last even
ing in the hearing of a large audience.
David W. Loring, the director, was
prevented through an accident from
conducting the concert. W. C. Stadt
feld carried out the work with genuine
success. The singers were found not
one whit less effective than in former
years, and of all the fine numbers
superbly sung special mention should
be made of the tender interpretation
of Mendelssohn's "The Voyage." The
merry, quaint and whimsical number,
"The Three Chafers," by tTruhn. was
rendered with stunning effect and ad
mirable judgment. Miss Ruth W. Lor
ing, the pianist, accompanied the sing
ers effectively and A. A. Macurda and
W. R. Kneiss, the soloists, rendered
their respective numbers artistically.

After an absence of twelve years,
during which the musical centers of
Europe have been .under the -thrall of
her wonderful voice, MmeC FranClsca
will give San Franciscans" an oppor- 
tunity to enjoy -a musical treat. 'Orf-
Friday night of this, week, she "will* be
heard in several famous arias and the
place selected for her appearance is
undoubtedly one of the finest concert
halls in the United States â the blue
and gold ballroom of the St. Francis.
It is typical of the great prima donna
that the concert will be for the benefit
of two charities, the San Francisco
Maternity and the San Francisco
Foundling Asylum.
Twelve years ago Mme. Francisea
left San Francisco, her birthplace, for
Paris. There she became a pupil of
Marchesi in the conservatory that
gave Mmes. Ilelba and Nevada to the
world. After a long and hard course
of training the great diva made her
debut and toured the capitals of Eu
rope. In turn she' captured Paris. Vi
enna, Munich, Monte Carlo and Am
sterdam. Possessed of a charming
personality and a wonderful voice, the
music lovers of the Continent became
enthusiastic over her.
A few weeks ago she concluded her
season at the Royal Opera, Am&ter
dam, and returned to America. Upon
arriving in New York Mme. Francisea
signed contracts for her appearance
in grand opera during the coming
winter. In the meantime she decided
to make a concert tour und naturally
seitcted her home city as the Â«ttj,:ti.ijir
piece.
Twice has Mme. Francisea appeared
in San Francisco since her return from
abroad and both times have San Fran
ciscans turned out to listen to her
singing. Friday night will probably
be her last appearance here before de
parting on her tour. Â» ;-. v~

failed thus far to move the Regente of
the University of California toward
the appointment of a secretary io suc
ceed W. A. McKeown, whose hands
are now calloused from sack-sewing at
Saa Quentin. The rulers of the educa
tional institution have been exploited
to the uttermost in endeavor to stir
them to action, but no seeker of the
coveted post has yet succeeded in
making a dent. The board had an
other meeting yesterday at which the
matter of the secretaryship was passed
over without a word.
After adjournment Regent A- W.
Foster of the finance committee, which

said that no attention had been given
to the selection of a secretary and that
the Etitus of the matter is as it was
many months ago. V. H. Henderson,
I r:vate secretary to President Wheel

sity and is giving satisfaction. Regent
Foster said, and as the expense ac
count is curtailed the board is in no
great haste to make an appointment.
The applicants have let up lately to
some extent in their importunities.

Successor Is Not Named
The Pacific Coast Women's Press As
sociation breakfasted yesterday at the
California Hotel and forever will it
stand as a monument to ice- water ban
quetsâthe clever toasts the supreme
test
No prettier breakfast table could be
conjured up than the horseshoe of
white linen, yellow chrysanthemums
and feathery fern, the product of the
clever Mrs. Josephine H. Foster's deft
fingers.
Banks of woodwardia filled the niches
and corners; a great yellow and white
heart of blossoms was suspended from
a superb lantern of brass in the cen
ter, while the place cards bore the flam
ing emblem of the State. And the
floral heart, by the way, was sent as
a token of love, at the conclusion of
the feast, to the well beloved but ab
sent member, Ina D. Coolbrith.
At the black coffee, Mrs. Laura T.
Pinney, president of the club, extended j
a welcome In her own charming man
ner, presenting Mrs. Abbie E. Krebs '
as toastrhistress. Now, 'tis well known i
that Mrs. Krebs is an adept at man- j
aging big lumber concerns, but as a !
toastmistress she was making her de- I
butâ and scored a brilliant success. !
In turn she presented Mrs. "Wilena f
K. Stringer, who ! expatiated cleverly
on "Our Natural Enemies": Miss Mary .
Falrbrother, "Apple Pie Without
Cheese": Mrs. Ella M. Sexton, "Our ,
Grandmothers"; Mrs. Laura Bride !
Powers, "Goodfellowship Among .
tWomen"; Mrs. Madge Morris Wagner, {
"Women of the Pen."
Between times, Mrs. Josephine H. I
Foster, Mrs. Nellie Blessing Eylter (the
club's first president), Mrs. Sara E. ,
Reamer, Mrs. Frank Fredericks. Miss
Agnes Murphy and Miss Aimee Moore
of Australia contributed to the feast of .
goodfellowship.
A pretty feature of the affair* was j
the presentation to Mrs. Augusta Eich- :
ler, tne newest bride in the club, of a j
silver loving cup. !
During the programme the Schumann I
Club discoursed sweet music, while
Misa Margaret Slocomb rendered two
exquisite vocal numbers.
And what with flowers, toasts and
feasts material and spiritual, 'twas a
day long to be treasured in the annals
of -the club. i

CAN DRIXK TROUBLE.
Tliafs One \X"ay to Get It.
Although they won't admit It many
people who suffer from sick headaches
and other ails get them straight from
the coffee thev drink and it Is easily
proved if they're not afraid to leave it
to a test as in the case of a lady in
ConnelisviHe.
"I had been a sufferer from sick
headaches lor twenty-five years and
any one who has ever had a tad sick
headache knows what I suffered.
Sometimes three davs la the week I
would have to remain la bed, at other
times I couldn't lie down the pain
would be so great. My life was a tor-
ture and if I went away from home
for a day I always came back more
dead than alive.
"One day I was teiline a woman my
troubles and she told me she knew
that it was probablv coffee caused It.
She "said she had been cured by stop-
ping coffee and using Postum "Food
Coffee and urged me to try this food
drink.
"That's how I came to send out and
set some Postum and from that time
I've never been without it, for it suits
my taste and has entirely cured all of
my old troubles. Ail I did was to
leave off the coffee and tea and drink
well made Postum In Its place. This
change has done me more good -than
everything- else put together.
"Our bouse was like a drug store, for
my husband bought everything he
heard of to help me^wlthout doing any
good, but when I began on the Postum
my headaches ceased and the other
troubles Quickly disappeared. I have
a friend who had an experience Just
like mine, aad Postum cured her Just
as it did me.
"Postum n% only cured the head-
aches, but my general health has been
Improved and I am much stronger than
before. I now enjoy delicious Postum
more than I ever ' did coffee." Name
siven by Postum Co., Battle Creek.

Who is buying a
PIANO?
; If you are,x or '"even expect to buy -a
. piano shortly, you must not overlook a few
indisputable facts.
' In the first place, it is very important
that you select a reliable dealer, for pianos
are risky things to buy and are often very
deceiving in tone and appearance.
In the second place, it is better to go to .^
the concern selling the most pianos, for
they naturally have the best makes. Manu-
facturers always seek, as agents* the firm
making the most sales.
In the third place, if you are going to
buy on the monthly payment plan, you
must go to a firm well known for honest,
upright dealings. Some .contracts are very
dangerous instruments.
Sherman, Glay & Co. are one of the
oldest established music houses in San
Francisco. They are the second largest
concern of the kind in the United States.
Their new rent contract plan is an innova-.
tion. It binds them, but it does not bind you. .

Tax Collector Smith stated yester
day that his office is now prepared to
receive the second installment of taxes
for 1904, which , is now due. Tha
bills have all been made out and tax
payers will experience not the slight
est delay in paying them.
Acting on the requisition of the Tax
Collector the Civil Service Commis
sioners yesterday certified the names
of ten clerks from the eligible list for
service in the tax office. The regular
force had to be increased temporarily
to accommodate the many taxpayers
who desire to cancel their obligations
to the city.
Will Begin To-Day the Collection of
Second Installments for
the Year 1904.
TAX COLLECTOR SMITH
IS READY FOR BUSINESS
The board also voted to request H.
D. Loveland, who has been delegated
to represent the board at the Trans-
Mississippi Congress, to urge upon the
congress action favorable to the insti
tution of a national department of
mines and mining. A. P. Hill of San
Jose, on moticra of Manager Arthur R.
Briggs, was made an honorary member
of the board on account of the interest
he has manifested In the board's work.
A request from the national conference
at Mohonk Lake for the appointment
of a committee on international arbi
tration was not approved. Manager
Briggs reported that between Septem
ber 13 and October 10, 1473 persons were
registered as visitors at the exhibition
hall of the board in the Ferry build
ing and that of thia number 551 were
from the United States outside of Cali
fornia and 91 from foreign countries.
The California State Board of Tnda
voted yesterday to request the Sere
tary of Agriculture of the Unted
States to appoint a special comala
sloner to ascertain and report regard
ing all agricultural products that :an
be raised in this State. The possi ili
ties in such a proposition are large
W. H. Mills had been urging thattha
Pacific Coast deserved to have a ju
reau of agriculture, a branch of hÂ«
national department, but conductedon
independent lines because the agTial
tural conditions on the Pacific Cast
are different from those of any ot'er
portion of the United States. Incide.t
ally he remarked that the present fet
of California products does not hit
represent the possible varieties bf
growths. He did not think that 'a
branch department of agriculture ccnid
be secured, but a special commlsslonr
to inquire and report could benefit t.o
State largely. The outside world ail
the people of California also woui
learn much of advantage to this Statx.
Mr. Mills asserted that Luther Bui.
bank, the California wizard of agricut
ture and horticulture, has done mon
for agriculture, in the matter of dl^
coveries in fruits, vegetables and too
age plants, than any other person. Hi.
alone, without pay, has performed i
great work. The board adopted Ma
Mills' view of the matter and an eff or
will be made at once to enlist the De ;
partment of Agriculture In the worS
of scientifically and practically deter-!
mining the agricultural possibilities ol
California to their fullest extent.
It took Attorney Roscoe S. Gray part
of the morning and all of the afternoon
to read the questions and answers and
the voluminous correspondence which
passed between Craig and Dowie dur
ing the latter*s missionary travels on
the coast and after he went to Chicago.
Dowie declares that Craig never made
a personal demand on him for pay
ment of the money and never suggested
that he owed him a cent. He quoted
one of Craig's letters stating that he
had written off the expense of the
opera-house mission and although he
had lost the money he considered it a
valuable experience and it had taught
him a lesson.
The divine healer savs that when
Craig sent him the Cadman note (for
half of the opera-house expense) he
told Dowie not to worry about it; "it
being clear," said Elijah, "that he
wanted to relieve my mind of the re
sponsibility for the note." "When Craig,
in a letter to Dowie's attorney Packard,
suggested that it would be a graceful
thing for him to pay the debt, Dowie
said it was dishonorable, because Craig
had said the debt had been "written
off." In the letter to Packard- Craig
had suggested that the gifts received
by Dowie at the mission had not been
turned into the receipts. Dowie char
acterized this as a fabrication and the
apostle of Zlon also declared that he
never told Craig that he expected re
mittances from Australia from which
he could pay the obligation. In the
same letter Craig said that Dowie had
made no return for the favors shown
him here. Dowie said this was an im
pertinence, as he was the means of
bringing much blessing of God upon
the Craig family. In response to a
question as to whether or not he con
sidered that he owed Mr. Craig any
â¢thing, Elijah responded "Not one cent."
The prophet called attention to the
fact that Mr. Craig's daughter had vis
ited him for a week in Chicago; that
he had dined her father and placed his
horses and carriage at their disposal
when Mr. Craig passed through in 1898.
Their relations at the time, ten years
after the date of the mission, were, he
said, very friendly.
A curious mixture of finance, re
ligion, scriptural quotations and re
criminations was displayed in the
deposition of John Alexander Dowie,
which was read yesterday in Judge
Murasky's court In the trial of the suit
of Hugh Craig to recover $1762 from
"Elijah II."

Early in the day the corn market was weak
as a result of profit-taking consequent to ' a
bearish Government , crop report. Later, ' how
ever, a firmer feeling developed on active cov
ering by shorts. â¢ The late market was helped
by the small primary receipts and by a report
ed decrease In the - world's - visible supply of
nearly 2,500,000 bushels. December opened un
changed to %o lower at 47%c to 4Sc, sold be-'

CHICAGO, Oct. 11. â Suddenly awakened sus
picion that sailing had been largely overdone
transformed weakness In wheat to-day into
strength. At the close the price of both De
cember and May deliveries was %c above yes
terday's final figures. Initial quotations â¢ on
December . were %c to %c lower at $1 08 to
$108%. May was down %c to %c to %<g:%c
at $1 08% to $1 08%. There was heavy liqui
dation of December, causing a rapid decline,
the price dropping to $107% within the first
half hour. May weakened In sympathy to
$1 07%. Other factors that contributed to the
selling pressure were lower cables and liberal
receipts In the Northwest. Weather In the
Northwest also was reported favorable to the
free movement of the crop. For a. time, the
celling was quite general. Commission houses
had numerous stop-loss orders, the execution
of which added to the weakness. Later in the
daj the demand Improved considerably, -many
traders apparently acquiring the Impression
that the market had been heavily oversold ear
lier In the session. Shorts covered freely. Â¦Â¦ In
consequence the market soon regained all the
early loss. Light receipts at Kansas City,
with prospects of much smaller arrivals In the
near future, had , a strengthening influence.
Shortly before the close the market touched
the highest point of the day, DecembÂ«r selllnir
at $1 00 V4. May sold*up to $1 09%. The mar
ket closed strong, with- December at $1 09 and
May at $1 00%Â«*l 09^.

Dealers quote differently regarding Butter.
Those who are cleaned up of fine creamery
(and they are in the majority) quote this grade
at SCc. while some who are still sufficiently
supplied do not quote over 20c. But the mar
ket for fancy goods is unquestionably, firm,
while the medium and lower grades are still
dragging.
Cheese has a wider range, and Â¦ there Is now
quite a gap between old. and new. Good new
is getting scarcer right along, and while one
cr two houses are well supplied with both old
and new, the majority of the trade are cleaned
up and are trying to buy from one another.
This gives the market a firm appearance. The
current reduction In supplies is caused, by
many makers In the country having recently
stopped producing the goods on account of the
long-continued dullness at low prices.
Eggs rule firm at the advance notPd at the
beginning of the week, with fine ranch well
cleaned up.
Receipts were 20,500 lbs Butter, 575 cases

Trade In Potatoes continued active and. al
though receipts were liberal, the market had
a steady tone 'and prices were well main
tained. There have been several cars of cheap
stock shipped out of the state during the past
few days, and this has had a tendency to
strengthen the market for high-grade offerings.
The top quotation for Salinas Burbanks was
obtained only for ane well-known brand of
selected stock, $1 35 being the top for the
general market. There were no fresh Sweets
received and carrled-over lots brought an ad
vance. Onions were firm, with dealers expect
ing higher prices.
Receipts of miscellaneous vegetables were
lighter" than usual, as the recent rain checked
picking In the verlous growing districts. The

XnW YORK. Oct. 11.â The stock market
once more retrieved itself from a temporary
setback to-day and reeumed the advance. The
j rise was not even and not entirely comprehen
tive. the , greater part I of the trading and the i
movement being congested in a few prominent :
Â¦tocka. The firmness in the rest of the mar- !
kÂ«t wait due largely to sympathy with the '
few strong stocks, but the hardness of the
market vas none ahe less clearly demon
strated. The optrnfaig- response to the Govern-
I ment crop report was disappointing with de
i creased promlsÂ»e of the yield both of corn and
! of wheat over tbe pessimistic esiimaU-s which
j had Kiiiaed authunty in the market waa so
J brUiiar.t that confidence in a prosperous out
j come of the harvests was confirmed. But the
holders of stocks were raoyed to take advan
tage of the showing to tell. The seller*
showed little disposition to make price concÂ«Â«
>-:o::f, however, and the pressure diminished as
prieea reached iuai debt's level. A reiteration
cf estimates of a two billion bushel torn crop
or less by the authorities whose first estimates
had impressed the financial community proved
or little effect In face of the Indications from
the Government figure* of 2, 420, 000, 000 bush-
I els or mere. The significance of this showing
I in view of the price level at which corn held
j proved effective la Imparting strength to the
1 fri-angers. and resulted in the large buying
I and f-ibsiar.tial advances in Union Pacific,
Atchiton and St. Paul. The Gould Southwest
err.s were inclined to hang back, apparently
affected by yesterday's accident on the Mis
souri Pacific and owing to dissatisfaction with
the earning statement contained In the yearly
report of the Wab<iÂ»h. United States Steel
I was subjected to early pressure and then ral-
J lird. but met sufficient offerings at yester-
I day's high price to Â«top its advance. New
I York CentraTa ~ 1 -^ point advance waa of only
j moderate influence on other Eastern railroads.
j Heading was sold to realize and Erie was hurt
1 by consideration of it* annual report, which
was circulated during the session. Brooklyn's
1 rlM nas attributed to good current earnings.
j Ttie ev^nt of the day in the world's financial
: markets was the advance from 4 to 6 pÂ»r
! cent of the discount rate of the Imperial Bank
I of Germany alter, having maintained the for
mt-r rate *ince â¢ June, 1003. Foreign exchange
hardened here in respanse and the continental
exchanges moved arulnst London; where dis
counts hardened and the price of gold was
advanced. Th# action of the German bank
I is not clearly understood, and !Â«Â»d to surmlÂ»<s
' that another Russian loan Is ln*ing prepared
for. Financial authorities In Ixindon have
pointed out that a relaxation of thÂ« money
!jtÂ» there would cau6<.- a withdrawal of large
French credits placed there and their transfer
to Iierlin. or in the event ot higher money
rates here to New York. Since the Panama
<anal payment I'aris money supplies have been
abundHnt, and large amounts have brtn placed
net only in I>on<lon, but in Germany as well.
ThÂ«Â» sharp advance in the German bank's dis
count rate may be Intrr.ded to hold French
credits in that market and to Invite further
commitments. Our stock market closed some
! what irregular and with be?t prices not fully
! maintained, in epite "' a late bidding up of
1 the southern group.

Forecaster Willson Thinks California
Will Now Have Several 'Days of'
Fair Weather.
Â¦ Forecaster Willson asserts that the
storm center has passed from Califor
nia and 'Oregon across the mountains
to Idaho, Nevada and Montana. The
fringe of the storm," however, was still
hanging over the State last night, and
the indications were that light show
ers might occur to-day *in the region
north of the Tehachapl.
The .barometer ' was at the normal
height yesterday, -while, the tempera
ture was slightly warmer. Off shore
the winds were rather high, but were
subsiding.- During .the early hours of
yesterday, morning, the storm was
most ': severe in San Francisco. The
rainfall in twelve hours was .71 of an
inch. :
x The rainfall for the season ud to
5 o'clock last evening was. 7. 18 Inches.
Last year the rainfall on the corre-'
sponding ' date was .17 of an inch.
fWillson v says the meteorologists are
not yet'- ready 'Â¦Â¦ to. advance an explana
tion for the existence of the abnormal
conditions. ' Â¦â¢'. ..- ..;.". . .
" From. present I ndica'tions California
should have fair weather for the next'
week or; two. -Â¦Â¦Â¦'Â¦.

Two Men Rob Saloon.
The saloon of John Smythe at
Grove and Polk streets was robbed at
9 o'clock yesterday morning by two
men, who got away and up to. a late
hour last night had not been caught.
Bernard Smythe, a brother of the pro
prietor of the saloon, was behind the
bar when a stranger entered the side
door and called him outside. Dur
ing his absence a confederate entered
the place and rifled the till of $4 65.
Hand Crushed by Car Wheel.
James McAsey, a teamster residing
at 143 Welch street, had his left hand
crushed by a freight car wheel on
Townsend street, near Fourth, yester
day. McAsey made an unsuccessful
attempt fo board a passing freight
train. He fell and in doing so threw
his hand over the track to break the
force of the fall. The wheel passed
over his hand. At the Emergency
Hospital Drs. Kucich and Godall am
putated half of the member, leaving
him only the index finger and thumb.
Police Commissioners Meet.
At a meeting of the Police Commis
sioners last night the charge of con
ducting a gambling game made
against King & Ward, proprietors of
the New Western and International
hotels, was dismissed. Joseph King,
one of the proprietors, alleged that he
had been bunkoed out of S3500 by
two card sharps and the Cimnv.ssion
ers considered that he had been suf
ficiently punished. Special Policemen
Frank Gillen and M. MIchalsen re
signed because they had. obtained
more lucrative cosition3.
The San Francisco Nursery for
Homeless Children appeals to the char
ity of every San Franciscan. By many
years of hard struggling and close fig
uring the nursery has been enabled to
purchase a city block on Lake street,
between Fourteenth and Fifteenth ave
nues. By donations of building ma
terials, contributions from private
sources, and benefits and '. fairs, the
foundations for an adequate building
have been completed.
This work has called for the. expendi
ture of a larce sum. Before starting
the foundation the nursery had $15,000
on hand. The building is estimated to
cost 535,000, therefore 520,000 more will
be needed before the home can be .com
pleted. The work has come to a stand
still* owing to lack of funds. Meantime,
at the old nursery on Mission street,
the authorities are ' compelled to turn
away*, many applicants daily. The
building is crowded and the nursery is
unable to care for more children, no
matter how urgent the necessity.
It is the desire of the nursery to
equip a large modern building, capable
of housing 150 to 200 children. -There
will be two large dormitories for boyS
and girls, a large room for babies un
der five years, playgrounds, dining
rooms, kitchens, an infirmary, laundries
and baths. Â£Â¦
Donations of building materials, trees
and shrubbery for the grounds, in fact,
anything that can possibly be used will
be gladly received. Address all contri
butions to the San Francisco Nursery
for Homeless Children, 1534 Mission
street. There has been an attempt
made to fraudulently collect money in
the name of the nursery. The nursery
has no agents. All contributions should
be sent to the home.
Another turn was given yesterday to
the great legal fight over the proposed
distribution of a portion of Adolph
Sutro's estate. The taking of testimony
upon the petition of Kate Nusbaum
and the other Sutro children, excepting
Dr. Emma L. Merritt, who is oppos
ing them, was ended some weeks ago
and the arguments have already oc
cupied days of time in Judge Coffey's
court. Yesterday was Garret Mc-
Enerney's turn to present the conten
tions of the petitioners, and he had the
case reopened in order to question Dr.
Merritt regarding her father's visit to
Europe in 1S82-83. Attorneys Mc-
Kinstry, Morrison and Silliman, rep
resenting the opposition, asked Mr. Mc-
Enerney to explain the purpose of the
examination and he said that he in
tended to base an argument on the cir
cumstances surrounding the making of
Sutro's will and their bearing upon the
interpretation to be given the trust
clause.
Dr. Merritt evinced some surprise
that Mr. McEnerney should know that
she met her father in Europe in 1883.
She said, however, that she had met
him at London, Paris, Genoa and else
where. She had received letters from
him, but at this late day could not re
member their contents. , She promised
to produce the letters in court. Dr.
Merritt also said that she did not know
that the trustees provided for in . the
will had ever organized or carried out
other provisions of the will.
A statement of the present condition
of the estate was offered in evidence
and at the beginning of his argument
Mr. McEnerney said that the estate
was in such a shape that his clients are
entitled to at least a distribution of
two-thirds of the property not In the
trust or incumbered by the Hibernla
Savings and Loan mortgage.
Mr. McEnerney stated that the prop
erty in ' the trust is worth $768,000:
that subject to the mortgage Is worth
5939,000. and that not in the trust or
incumbered $772,000. Property was re
cently sold for $158,000. and out of that
Dr. Merritt had paid 5100.000 to the
Hibernia Society, reducing - the mort
gage to 530S.500, and the executrix now
has 5108,000 on hand.. This showing,
said the attorney, was enough to prove
that the incumbered property was val
uable enough to pay the mortgage, the
unpaid legacies and all the expenses
of administration.
The lawyer then devoted his argu
ment to the support of, the binding ef
fect of the judgment, in the case of
Sutro against Merritt. in which the
court held that the charity trust was
void. This is the chief point of Dr.
Merritt's resistance, as the other, chil
dren are seeking to break the trust
and secure the rich property Included

Charged TTlth Assault With a Deadly
Weapon for Attackins NonÂ«Union
3Ian With Pitchfork.
The trial of Joseph Egan. better
known as "Kid" Egan, on a charge of
assault with a deadly weapon was on
before a Jury in Judge Cook'a court
yesterday. When court adjourned all
the evidence was in with the excep
tion of that of two witnesses in re
buttal.
"When the attorneys began to ques
tion the Jurors it was asked whether
they belonged to the Citizens' Alli
ance or to a labor union. The Judge
said he would not permit such ques
tions to be asked. The Jurors were
there as citizens and not as members
of any union or alliance. The attor
neys had a consultation and agreed
that each would have the privilege of
asking the question to which the Judge
had objected. The Judge said if It
was agreeable to both sides he would
withdraw his objection.
Egan was one of the striking stable
men and is accused of having attacked
Joel W. Fuller, a non-union stable
man, with a pitchfork near Golden
Gate Park on May 15.

The men who shout "Rags, bottles,

yesterday when a round dozen of them
were ranged up In front of the City
Hall Police Station by Officer Cottle
on the charge of peddling without li

City Hall resembled a route taken by
a retiring army in Manchuria, where

The Outdoor Art League of California
Is making preparations for a benefit
to be' given at the Majestic Theater
next Monday night. The object of the
benefit will be to raise a. good sum for
the prosecution of an educational cam
paign for the beautifying of San Fran
cisco. This city Is well fitted by nature
for transformation into one of the most
beautiful cities of the world and it is
hoped that the money resulting from
the benefit may aid in bringing about
the transformation.
The management and the stock com
pany havl co-operated with the league
to make the performance a success.
The attraction for the evening will be
the dramatization of Onoto Watanna's
book, "A Japanese Nightingale," and
a more fitting play could hardly have
been chosen.
The number of boxes and seats sold
indicates that the theater will be filled
with one of the largest and most fash
ionable audiences that has ever as
sembled in a San Francisco playhouse.
During the next few months the or
ganization intends to start a system
of instruction in school gardening that
will enlist the pupils and teachers of
the public schools i In the work of
adorning the city. The league deserves
credit for the results already achieved
in the beautifying of â¢ Telegraph Hill
and the parking of two blocks on Do
lores street in the vicinity of the old
Mission Dolores.
Among those who have charge of the
work are the following officers, and di
rectors of the league:

OUTDOOR ART LEAGUERS "WHO ARE
INTERESTED IN BENEFIT TO BE
GIVEN AT THE MAJESTIC.
Evidently satisfied to rest their hopes
of participating in the distribution of
Bertha M. Dolbeer's fortune upon the
success or failure of the contest against
her will begun by Adolph Schander. the
Eastern cousins of John Dolbeer, who
filed a contest shortly after Schander,
yesterday dismissed it. The notice of
dismissal was signed by George K.
Wells and Edmund Tauzsky, attorneys.
The contestants, children of John Dol
beer's brother, were Frazier M. Dol
beer, Jane Ann Brown, Alice H. Fern
and Stephen T. Dolbeer. They live in
New York.
If Schander is successful in breaking
the will the Easterners, as helrs-at-law,
would share in the estate.
An order for the taking of six more
depositions in New York for use In the
trial of the Schander contest was made
yesterday by Judge Coffey upon appli
cation of Attorney E. S. Pillsbury, rep
resenting executor William C. Mugan.
The witnesses, who are to be exam
ined orally on October 21, are Joseph
Roller, J. Turnbull, T." S. Rumney, W.
H. Barse, Elizabeth H. Horan and
Catherine Lee. Barse is manager of
the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, where Miss
Dolbeer met her death.
Before fixing the date at October 21
Judge Coffey listened to a lively con
troversy between Attorney Albert M.
Johnson and Alfred Sutro, representing
Mr. Pillsbury.' The latter wanted the
depositions taken on. November 2,
which is the date of the commencement
of the trial here. Mr. Johnson urged
that they be taken immediately after
the depositions of Witnesses Popendlck
and Miss Pflugel of the steamship
Deutschland on October 21. Johnson
said that his brother Hiram had gone
to New York last Saturday to be pres
ent at the taking of the deposition of
the Coroner and detectives on the 13th
and would remain to take the others,
but would have to return here in time
for the trial, whereas the other side
could have a representative in New
York at the later dateâ a disadvantage
for the contestant's attorneys. Con
sidering/that the proponents had been
anxious to hurry the case to trial,
Judge Coffey thought, for the con
venience of the other side, they should
stipulate for the taking of the deposi
tions at the earlier date. Mr. Sutro
refused to make such a stipulation, so
the court made an order. It is under
stood that an application for other
depositions will be made by Mr. Pills
bury.

Grocer's Honor
When you ask your grocer for Ghirardelli's
Ground Chocolate or Breakfast Cocoa, have you
enough faith in him to know that he won't
attempt to foist on you or your child cheap
â¢. imitations? If he is an honest man he will give
you the D. Ghirardelli Co.'s preparations. He
knows that they are what you want; what you
have always used; what created your preference
for chocolate and cocoa to coffee and tea. If he is
serving your interests conscientiously he will give
you D. Ohirardelli's brands.
On the other hand : if he is indifferent to your
wants, if the few cents extra profit will reconcile
him to betraying your trust, he will try to give
you cheap imitations of D. Ghirardelli's Chocolate
and Cocoa. Of course he risks the loss of your
custom by misrepresentation, for the groceT who
carries a counterfeit stock is a menace to the health
of the public.
There are hundreds of honest grocersâ there are
some others; Is yours among the others?
The genuine D. GlnrardellVs Groimd
Chacolater is packeci in patented
