FORTY BALTIMORE BLOCKS BURN
JAPAN CASTS THE DIE FOR WAR
BALTIMORE, Feb. S.â(5 a. m.)â The con*
flagration is spreading and the fire department,
assisted by engines sent from nearby cities, is
powerless. Jit this hour the fire area is nearly
a mile long and from two to eight blocks wide.
The loss at midnight was estimated at $4O,*
GOO,OOO, and since that hour nearly a score of
blocks have been laid in ruins. Jl heavy wind
has aided in the spread of the flames. So far
as known no lives have been lost, although
many firemen and others have been injured by
falling walls.

and continues beyond the control
of the multitude of firemen. Great

WASHINGTON, Feb. 8.â A
telephdne dispatch received from
Baltimore at 3 o'clock says the
Mount ~Vernon Telephone Ex
change is burning and that the
St. Paul Telephone Exchange has
burned out. The Mount Vernon
Exchange is about eight blocks
from the Union station.
The postoffice building has been
burned, also the Courthouse. The

The fire has reached Jones
Falls, â¢ the strean\that separates
Baltimore from East Baltimore,
and a high wind is blowing. The
East Baltimore section consists of
small residential houses.
When the fire reached Jones
Falls the wind changed, driving
the fire south, and it reached the
wharves, where much inflamma

been many changes in the course
of the fire since it started. It
first took a northerly direction,
swerved northeast until about 4
o'clock and then struck due east.

wholesale dry goods house of
John T: Hurst & Co. has raged
with unrestrained fury contin
ually ever since, and at midnight
it is still unchecked, but is 'stead

NAGJ^SAKh Japan, Feb. 7.â Much real en>
thusiasm has been created by the mobilization
of the Japanese second reserves, who are now
nxarching through the streets to their quarters.
The men turned out splendidly. The Russian
flag is still flying over the consulate here, but, the
German Consul will take over the Hussian inter*
ests here during the war. It is stated that the
Russian meh*opwar and transports returned to
Port Arthur after visiting a position to the north

ments Recall Their Re
spective Ministers.
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 7.
â Although the fear was general
here yesterday that the presenta
tion of the Russian note to Japan
might be followed by an act on
the part of the Japanese Govern
ment which would plunge the two
countries into war, the startling
action of Japan in severing diplo
matic relations with Russia be
fore the . actual delivery of the
Russian note came like * a bolt
from a clear sky. It was believed
that the receipt of the note might
have unmasked an ultimatum, but
that Japan should sever diplo
matic relations â a step little short
of a declaration of war â was . al
most like a blow in the face under
the present circumstances, and it is
resented here accordingly. The
authorities believe this ' action
places Japan distinctly in the
wrong before the world, and
moreover such a "piece of impu
dence," as it is denominated here,
makes easy an appeal to the pa
triotism of the Russian people.
The news at any moment that
Japan had drawn the sword and
that the first clash had occurred
would not be surprising.

was already in the hands of Baron
de Rosen, Russian Minister in
Tokio, for delivery to Baron Ko

ister, when, at 4 o'clock yesterday
afternoon, Kurino, the Japanese
Minister here, presented himself
at the Foreign Office and in
formed Foreign Minister Lams
dorff that his Government, in view
of the delays in connection with
the Russian answer and the futil
ity hitherto of the negotiations,
considered it. useless to continue
diplomatic relations and would
take such steps as it deemed proper
for the protection of Japan's in
terests. In obedience to instruc
tions therefore he asked for his
passports. Exactly what else
passed at this interview is hot
known, except that Count Lams
dorff expressed surprise and re
gret at this hasty resolve of the
Mikado's Government.
Kurino received his passports
and, affter consulting with Sir C.

here, he returned to his legation,
where the preparations for his de

building. Ross' drug store and
FAILS TO CHECK FLAMES.
However, this heroic remedy
merely delayed but did not se
riously impede the onward march
of the conflagration, and for two
hours or more the Fire Depart
ment was practically heipless and
resourceless in the face of the
roaring furnaces which sent their
fierce tongues two hundred feet
into the air and which filled the
heavens first with a pall of black
smoke and then with livid sheets
of sparks and lurid cinders.
Following the rapid destruction
of the palatial commercial build
ings in the wholesale district the
cyclone of roaring flames burst
into Baltimore street, licking with
in a few minutes the seven-story
Mullins Hotel -like some monster
rapidly rolling with irresistible
force both east and west, cutting
down wholesale and retail houses,
manufactories, shops, jewelry
stores, furniture depots and res
taurants.
At Charles street the remorse
less tide swept on down Baltimore
street, but also turned into Charles
street, where it quickly engulfed
the eleven-story Union Trust
building. At 8 o'clock occupants
of the Daily Herald building, at
Lafayette and St. Paul streets,
and of the Record building oppo
site were compelled to vacate by
the flame?, as were the occupants
of the Calvert and Equitable
structures, two of the most mas
sive office buildings in Baltimore.
LEAVES STREET IX RUIXS.
Bown Baltimore street, a paral
lel wall of roaring, crackling
flames swept, consuming every
thing in its course, speedily reach
ing the Evening News building,
from which the employes had to
hastily flee, although not until val
uable records had been removed.
Shortly thereafter the Continental
Trust Company's fourteen-story
building took fire. A block below
the American newspaper building
was enveloped in clouds of sparks
and burning splinters. At this
hour it is certain that the Herald
and American will not get out is
sues to-morrow.
The financial district, including
the chief banking and brokerage
firms on South and Gorman
street?, seem to be now doomed,
scores of the city's leading finan
ciers and business men are scur
rying in and out of their offices,
bearing packages or placing val
uables in convenient places.
HEAVENS ILLUMINATED.
During all these hours the
pyrotechnic display has been
magnificent and imposing be
yond the power of painter to de
pict. At this hour vast columns
of flame are shooting skyward at
varying points of the compass,
and in the firmament is one vast
prismatic ocean of golden and sil
ver hucd sparks. Great multi
tudes of people line the streets,
awe-struck by the panorama
which is being enacted before
their eves.
At 10:40 o'clock the roof of
the building occupied by the As
sociated Press took fire and the
employes were compelled to ' va
cate, though they had time to
take with them their telegraph in
struments, typewriters and other
valuable equipment. They found
refuge in a branch office of the
Western Union Company on Gay
street The prospect is that this
office will have to be vacated in
a few minutes as the flames are
breaking west and east and vol
umes of sparks and blazing cin
ders and splinters are flying in
every direction.
FLAMES BEYOND CONTROL.
At this hour the fire is abso
lutely beyond control and all oc
cupants of buildings in the center
of the city are rapidly removing
their valuables.
The City Hospital, corner of
Calvert and Pleasant streets, is
removing to other hospitals as
rapidly as possible the twenty
four patients in that institution.
Seventeen injured were brought
to this hospital, most of them fire
men. They were suffering from
burns, scalds and lacerations.
Nearly every physician in the city
is in the fire district. So far as
known at this hour no one has
been killed.
Detachments of the Fourth
2nd Fifth Regiments have been
called out and are patrolling the
streets in the vicinity of the fire,
guarding the property and keep
ng order.
Fortunately thus far the con
flagration has not reached the
residence portion of the city, but
fires are breaking out in East
Baltimore and the ' indications
are that the residence streets are
doomed to be invaded.
The indications are that not a
single morning newspaper will
be able to get out an "issue to
morrow morning, with the possi
ble exception of the Sun, which
has an auxiliary plant. There are
five morning papers here â three
English and two "German.
The Baltimore and Ohio Rail
road office building has been de
stroyed and so has the Maryland
Institute of* Art.
At 1 1 :45 the temporary Cus
tom-house adjoining the postof

fifty policemen" from Philadelphia
have arrived to assist the Balti

START OF THE CONFLAGRATION.
Dozen Big: Warehouses Burning
Fiercely Within Half Hour.
BALTIMORE, Feb. 7.â To-day's flre
visitation was the most appalling dis
aster in the history of Baltimore. The
flames, raging practically unchecked
during many hours, completely de
stroyed scores of the largest business
houses In the wholesale district. Owing
to the wide extent of the calamity it
will be to-morrow before an approxi
mate estimate can be made.
The flre started shortly before eleven
o'clock this morning in the wholesale
dry goods store of John E. Hurst &
Co., on Hopkins place. In the heart of
the business district, with a series of
loud explosions, which were heard in
remote parts of the city, and spread
with fearful rapidity.
In a half-hour a dozen big ware
houses in the wholesale dry goods and
notions district were burning fiercely.
The entire city flre department was
called out, but was utterly powerless
to check the spread of the flames, which
were aided by high winds, and by noon
there were savage fires in at least
thirty big warehouses and the flames
were steadily eating their way into suc
cessive blocks north, west and south.
On Baltimore street the block between
Liberty and Sharp streets was soon
ablaze. Then came the next block east
to Hanover, and after that the block on
the south side to Charles street broke
out into flames, the Consolidated Gas
Company's building and Oehm's Hall
burning fiercely.
Meanwhile stores north of Baltimore
street were being similarly consumed.
Mullins* Hotel was ignited and other
buildings near it. West of Liberty
street, on the south side of Baltimore,
the block was doomed, and the big Bal
timore Bargain House also attacked. In
Hopkins place, where the fire started.
Hurst's building and other wholesale
houses on both sides of the street
crumbled and fell.
The big dry goods houses of Daniel
Miller & Sons and M. A. Sutton & Co.
were soon aflame, and along* German
street east and west from the Hurst
building a dozen buildings were burn
ing and scores more threatened.
Mass & Kemper's big wholesale store
on Baltimore street quickly succumbed
to the flames, and the walls fell with a
crash that was heard for squares. The
Hurst building was utterly destroyed,
not even a wall ten feet high being left
standing, and was apparently the cen
ter of the caldron whence the flames
radiated over the doomed district.
In Hopkins place the Hopkins Sav
ings Bank and the National, Exchange
Bank were gutted by flames, the few
strtams of water that the firemen, were
able to turn upon them proving utterly
ineffectual to even halt the destruction.
Here, across the street, were the ruins
of John E. Hurst & Co., of the build
ing next to it, S. C. Hecht Jr. & Sons'
block, was in flames. Adjoining was
the large building owned by the Wil
liam Koch Importing Company, which
also was quickly destroyed.
Acrogs tho street, the Stanley Drug
Company building was soon in ruins.
Fronting on the Baltimore-street side
of this block were the Roxbury Rye
Distilling Company, the building occu
pied by Sllberman & Todes, the house
of Allen, Sons & Co., which had hardly
been completed, and next to It the es
tablishment of 11. Moses & Co. On the
corner was the building occupied by
Sugar & Shear and several ' other
smaller concerns. All of these were
burned, the whole square being a mass
of flames. 4
At 1:30 o'clock Mullins' Hotel, a
weven -story structure at Liberty and ,
Baltimore streets, was in flames from
garret to cellar and its great height and
narrowness converted the doomed
building into a huge I and dreadful
torch. All of the guests of the hotel
had been ordered out of the building
shortly after the fire broke out in
Hurst's place. There was no panic or*
confusion and no. one was Injured.'
Though every bit of fire-fighting ap
paratus in the city was called Into
requisition as the flames continued to
spread, the firemen realized that they
had a task before them which was too
great for them to combat. Telegrams
for flre engines were sent to Wash
ington and Philadelphia and at 1
o'clock bIx engines arrived from Wash
ington and four from Philadelphia and
joined in the battle with the flames.
Engines from stations in Baltimore;
Howard, Anne Arundel and Hartford
counties also arrived as soon as pos
sible, some of the apparatus traveling
a distance of thirty miles or more.
Water plugs in every section within
a radius of a half-mile from the flre
were in use and it is roughly estimated
that 350 streams were playing at one
time upon different parts of the flre.
Owing to the great congestion of flre
apparatus, the crowds of people and the
general confusion, many of the engines
from out of town were unable to find
a place where they would be of any
service.
The area bounded by German, Lib
erty, Sharp and Baltimore streets was
early found to be doomed, and the fire
men turned their attention to saving
the buildings on Baltimore street, east
of Sharp.
The flre wag beyond their control and
the flames ran from one building to an
other in spite of the fact that the flre
men did their best to check their prog-

reuÂ«3 by soaking <the structures with
water.
Cinders Ignited the roof of the Front
Street Theater, a half mile away, and
for a time it looked as though that
structure l would be destroyed. The
blaze was extinguished by firemen and
citizens.
Much alarm was felt at the City Hos
pital when the rain of cinders was at
its fiercest. The Sisters of Mercy, in
charge of the institution, were all at
their posts and an effort was made to
keep the fact of the fire a secret from
the patients. A few cinders fell on
the roof of the hospital, but were ex
tinguished by the physicians of the
house staff. Eighteen Avomen, two ba
bies and seven nurses were taken from
Che Maternity Hospital on West Lom
bard street in police ambulances and
given quarters at the City Hospital.
At 3 o'clock a tremendous explosion
of 150 barrels of whisky stored in the
upper floors of 24 Hanover street hurled
tons of burning matter across the street
on to the roofs of the building opposite,
which the firemen were drenching with
water in a vain hope to make Hanover
street the eastern boundary line of the
fire. The flames quivered for a few mo
ments under the water, but soon ate
into the buildings on the east side. A
flre engine wan buried by a falling wall,
the firemen fleeing for their lives.
The whole city was notified of the
flre by a terrific explosion some minutes
after 11 o'clock. A sharp, splitting roar
went up with reverberating thunder.
This was followed by a peculiar whist
ling noise, like that made .by . shrill
wind. The churches in the central sec
tion of the city were filled with "wor
shipers, many of whom became fright
ened, and, though no panic ensued,
hundreds of men and women left.. their
seats and went outside to see what had
occurred.
In *a few moments the streets
throughout the city were crowded with
excited people. Another deafening
crash occurred and dense columns of
cinders and smoke shot up over the
central section of the city and in a
huge brown column moved rapidly tow
ard the northwest. Borne on the strong
southeast wind the column of smoke,
blazing cinders and even Rieces of tin
roofing, spread over the center of* the
city and a rain of cinders fell, com
pelling pedestrians to dodge the coals-
Two more explosions followed and
thousands of persons hurried to the
scene of the flre. Pieces of tin 6 by 8
feet eauare were lifted into the aid
by the terrific heat, sailing upward like
paper kites and when they reached a
point beyond the zone of the most in
tense heat fell fluttering to the street.
Crash after crash followed within the
burning district, but even the firemen
could not tell from what buildings they
proceeded. Walls and flooring fell in
with thunderous roars that echoed
blocks away.
Hundreds of merchants and business
men with offices in the threatened dis
trict were notified by watchmen and the
police. Nearly all took steps to have
their books removed to places of safe
ty. Hundreds of men and boys were
engaged to move the books.
TELEGRAPHERS IN PERIL'.
Employes of the Western Union Can
not Now Be Located. > .
BALTIMORE AND CAMDEN STA
TION. Baltimore;" Feb. 8.â At 2=20
o'clock this morning, the Western
Union Telegraph Company's operators
who abandoned their desks in order to
go to the Baltimore and Camden sta
tion to resume their work have not yet
been heard from. The corps of Associ
ated Press operators, who had twice
been burned out during the night and
who also started for the same destina
tion to resume the sending of press
dispatches, taking with them their
copy, have failed to appear.
It seems probable from this fact that
all of the telegraphers have been
hemmed in by the flre in such a man
ner that it was impossible for them to
reach their destination, owing to an
easterly wind, thus making It neces
sary for them to take a roundabout
course of several miles. It also is pos
sible that they are hemmed in by the
fire district and Chesapeake Bay. In
the latter event they would be com
pelled to take boats to a ptrint opposite,
Camden station. This party of opera
tors and other employes, also news
paper men, must have numbered 100
or more.
WITH â¢FURY OF TIDAL WAVE.
Billows of Fire Quickly Blot Out
) the Skyscrapers. '
WASHINGTON, Feb. 8. â A member
of the staff of the Baltimore Sun, who
came over with the force of that paper
last night, said the fury of the flre was
beyond description. He said:
"The flames swe*pt down the streets
with the onward rush and fury of a
tidal wave. Great billows of flree 200
feet high would fill the space between
the buildings, and, sweeping from side
to side, would blot out of existence a
skyscraper as though it were a box of
matches."
Appeal to New York for Help.
NEW YORK, Feb. 8. â A request for
assistance from the Fire Department
of New York has been received from
Baltimore. â¢ Chief Croker has ordered
a force to be made ready and is ar

to send engines and men on a special

TROUBLESO3IE MISTAKE .
IN SENDING OUT STAMPS
a I,
Soft Gummed Ones Sent -to Places
# That Should Have Hard
v . Gummed Ones.
It is probably news to the majority of
the people that the stamps they use on
their letters are differently, gummed at
different seasons. The year is divided,
for the purpose of this branch of the
work of- the Postoffice Department, into
winter and .summer, and the stamps
are gummed' according/to the .season.
Those for . summer use have a harder
gum than the ones that are intended
for the cold weather, and to some of the
northern points of the country the sum
mer stamps are sent the whole year
around, and vice versa. The stamps in
tended for use in the Philippines" and
Porto Rico are always of the winter
variety and are soft gummed, while
those -for Alaska are â¢ summer, stamps
and have a harder gum on their backs.
Stamps having the hard summer gum
tend to warp in cold weather, and the
soft gum for winter use would be utterly
Impracticable during ;warm weather.
Recently there has been a mistake
made by , the stamp division of the
Postoffice Department, and many of
fices : have ' been getting the vhard
gummed summer stamns instead of the
winter variety.;' The conseauence was
that, they "curled, and the people and
the .postmasters made loud complaints.
An order was -accordingly issued by Mr.
Madden, ! Third Assistant. Postmaster
General, whose office controls the
stamp supply, to the - effect that if the
stamps were returned to the depart- !
ment :a ; new batch . would be -sent the;
offices' and' the trouble would cease. â

Admiral Sir Edward Chichester As
signed to Command Great Naval
Station at Gibraltar.
Admiral Sir Edward Chichester. who
will always be kindly remembered In
this country, especially among naval
men,* on account of the friendly feeling
for America which he displayed at a
critical moment in Manila Bay In the
days there of Admiral Dewey. has Just
received one of the most agreeable and
Important commands at the disposal of
the British Admiralty. It is that of
commanding: naval officer at Gibraltar,
which is one of England's two great
naval stations in the Mediterranean,
the other being Malta. It is a shore
rather than a sea berth, and carries
with it the finest residence on the rock,
the house standing 1 in lovely and large
gardens some, 300 feet up the hill above
the dockyard, and consequently com
manding superb views of the straits
and the Atlantic beyond, between the
Spanish coast on the one hand and the
African coast on the other. Government
house, otherwise the convent, which la
the official residence of the general
commanding the troops at Gabraltar.
Is situated at the foot of the rock, in
side the old wall, and is so intolerably
hot In summer that the Governor has
to take refuge in a cottage on the east
ern or Mediterranean side of Europe
Point.
Sir Edward Chichester was naval
transport officer at Cape Town during
the South African war. and contributed
in no small measure to the most mar
velous and successful feature of that
campaignâ namely, the transport of an
army of over 200.000 men from England
to South Africa, a distance of 7000 miles,
within the space of a few weeks. At
Gibraltar Sir Edward will have abund
ant opportunity of renewing relations
with his former good friends In the
American navy. There are few Eng
lishmen whose names are held in more
kindly regard in this country than Sir
Edward's, whose baronetcy dates back
to the reign of K!ng James and Is de

LEGATION IS ABANDONED
When the representative of the
Associated Press called at the
Japanese legation this morning he
found a scene of great confusion.
During the night, as if by magic,
all the Japanese art treasures,
bronzes and ivories had dis"ap
peaTed and the spacious salons
\\ ere bare.
Servants and attaches, who had
l>een working all night, were still
bosily engaged in packing papers
and archives. Kurino entered the
salon with his habitual quick and
nervous step. His bloodshot eyes
gave evidence that he had been a
stranger to sleep, but he displayed
the impassive characteristics of
his race and was without a trace
of excitement. There was an air
of firm resolution about him, how
ever, which was theonlv notice-
able change in his demeanor.
Throughout the strain which
has just passed the attitude of the
Japanese Minister has been strict
ly correct. He has been on good
terms personally with Count
Lamsdorfr" and the other Russian
officials. To-day, as is customary
with him, he was extremely reti
cent and declined to offer, an ex
planation of the course of Japan,
saying the authorities in Tokio
would doubtless give the world
their side of the story. He ven-

tured, however, to point out that
the irritation created by the delay
in the Russian response, postponed
from day to day, together with
forecasts of what it contained,
might have convinced his Gov
ernment that it was futile to pro
ceed further with diplomacy.
KURIXO SPEAKS IN SADNESS.
As Kurino looked out of a win
dow at the legation, which face's
the Neva, not far from the Winter
Palace, he saw a battalion of the
Russian Imperial Guard, clad to
the heels in big overcoats and their
guns slung over their backs. He
showed no emotion at the sight.
He said, rather sadly, that the
rupture of diplomatic relations did
not necessarilv mean war.
United States Embassador Mc-
Cormick 1 was one of Kurino' s
first callers this morning, and later
in the day other diplomats, among
whom the Minister is popular,
came to express to him their re
grets at the turn affairs had taken.
In the afternoon Kurino and his
wife made a number of hurried
farewell* calls, including one at
the American embassy.

DIPLOMATS AND CABINET MINISTERS WHO HAVE TAKEN A PROMINENT PART IN THE FUTILE NEGO
TIATIONS TO AVERT WAR OVER THE FAR EASTERN EMBROGLIO, AND A TYPICAL MILITARY
SCENE IN THE LAND OF THE MIKADO. -
PARIS, Feb. 7.â The official an
nouncement that Japan has broken off
diplomatic negotiations with Russia
caused a profound sensation here, as it
was generally accepted as being one
step short of actual war. The first of
ficial Information of this move reached
Foreign Minister Delcasse early in the
day. While he was at the Foreign Of
fice the French 'Minister at Tokio tele
graphed that he had taken charge of
Russia's interests there on the depart
ure of Baron de Rosen, the Russian
Minister, to Japan.
Later in the day Motono, the Japan
ese Minister to France, delivered to
Delcasse the official notification of the
Japanese Government of the severance
of diplomatic relations with Russia,
The French Foreign Minister communi
cated these communications to Presi
dent Loubet at the Elysee Palace and
throughout the day the Ministers dis
cussed the situation.
Public interest has been aroused to
the highest pitch and all through the
afternoon the boulevards were flooded
with extras announcing Japan's action.
To-night the imminence of war is the
general theme in all public places, the
crowds at the hotels, theaters and cafes
eagerly discussing the war news.
The embassies and legations have
been unusually active to-day, many of
them remaining open to communicate
with their governments. United States
Embassador Porter, when seen to
night, expressed the deepest regret at
the_unfavorable turn of events.
The Japanese Government communi
cated a statement to Motono announc
ing that diplomatic relations had been
broken* off, and giving details of the
reason therefor. Motono took this
statement to the Foreign Office, where
he personally communicated it to For
eign Minister Delcasse. Subsequently
the Japanese Minister gave the press
the following statement:
"TOKIO, Feb. 6.â The last Japanese
note in response to the Russian note of
January 6 was remitted to the Russian
Minister at Tokio on January 13. The
Japanese Government had insisted that
a prompt response" be made to it, ow
ing to the gravity of the situation.
Not receiving the answer requested,
Kurino, the Japanese Minister at St.
Petersburg, has made to Count Lams
dorff on several occasions recently rep
resentations in order to secure an an
swer from "Russia. Not having obtained
this answer,, he asked him to indi
cate the earliest date for the re
ply. Count Lamsdorff, while prom
ising to make a response as early as
possible, has not been able to indicate
when the response could be transmitted
to the Japanese Government.'

come.
answer for more than three weeks, and
having been, moreover, informed that
Russia was making active preparations
for war, and was concentrating troops
and her naval forces toward Korea, it
is under the necessity of breaking its
negotiations with Russia and resuming
Its liberty of action."
The Japanese action has created a
distinct surprise and shock throughout
official and diplomatic circles here. Only
last night the representative of the
Associated Press talked with an Em
bassador of one of the great powers
who had just received official informa
tion showing, that the German Govern
ment expected the prolongation of ne
gotiations.
"You can say positively and confi
dentially," the Embassador said, "that
Russia's response is certain to neces
sitate a reply from Japan and the diplo
matic negotiations must, therefpre,
continue.'/ â  * â¢â¢ â - â¢
Officials of the Foreign Office, shared
this belief that further negotiations
were certain, so to-day's announcement
that Japan had actually terminated her
diplomatic relations with Russia caused
the most profound agitation. Foreign
Minister Delcasse varied his usual cus
tom by spending most of the day at the
Foreign Office, where he received direct
dispatches announcing the withdrawal
of Baron de Rosen from Tokio.
At â¢ noon* he received Motono, who
brought the lengthy official announce
ment from the Tokio Government that
a decisive step had been taken â â  in
breaking off Motono ex
pressed the view that this was not the
result of Russia's last answer, which,
in fact, had not been received by Japan
when this determination had been
reached, but on the contrary the break-
Ing off of relations vfas due, solely, to
Russia's procrastination and her con
centation of military and naval forces
toward Korea. No further effort was
made to disguise the seriousness of the
situation" and Motono himself , made
public the declaration of his Govern
ment that relations had been severed.
PROSPECT OF MEDIATION.
There is reason to â¢believe that the
French authorities will give considera
tion to the idea of mediation, but It is
said that such action would be difficult.
In view of i the recent declaration of
Japan that . she >vould not accept in-Â»
tervention of any kind, as the question
was one to be regulated between her
self and Russia. Nevertheless, it is ex
pected that France will approach Great
Britain Avith the view of that power
making representations to Japan, while
Fr.ance at the same time will make
representations to Russia in order to
prevent an cfctbreak of hostilities.
While it is admitted that a long step
has already been taken toward war by
Japan having broken off relations, in
the opinion of officials and diplomatists
here there still i3 a slight chance of
averting hostilities, and this chance will
be seized.
The Japanese legation here has been
the center of much excitement since
this morning and throughout to-day it
was besieged by representatives of the
diplomatic corps eager to obtain copies
of Japan's official statement, in. order
to notify .their respective Governments.
"When a press representative called at
the legation to-night a member of the
British embassy was â¢ just leaving.
Motono and the legation officials talked
freely. They did not appear to be de
pressed, but rather confident and even
happy that a decision finally had been
taken.
It was Intimated that arrangements
had already been made for Kurino's
departure from St. Petersburg. It was
thought at first that he might come
to Paris, but it is the present intention
that he go to Berlin and there await
the final determination as to whether
he is to remain in Europe or return to
Japan.
MINISTER MOTOXO TALKS.
Motono gave the press the statement
given heretofore as the best explana
tion of the situation, but in addition
he said:.' - i / :
"The" Government statement clearly
shows that relations are at an end.
Whether or not this means war I am
unable to say, but it is ' obvious that
the step, already taken is of the grav
est character and one which may mean
war. - What result may come no one
can say at this time, but the reasons
for the action j of the governments
should be distinctly understood.
"It; is not true that Baron Komura,
the Japanese Foreign Minister, re
ceived-* yesterday any note from Baron
de Rosen and therefore the action of
Japan in breaking off relations was not
a result of the Russian reply. No re
sponse has been remitted by Russia

Count Casslni. the Russian Ambassa
dor, promptly on the receipt of a long
cablegram from Count Lamsdorff. the
Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs,
drove to the residence of Mr. Loornis,
the acting: Secretary of State, shortly
before noon to-day, and informed him
of the dispatch received rf rom the, head
of the Russian Foreign Office. In sub
stance Count Lamsdorff's dispatch was
to this effect:
Before Baron de Rosen -could trans
mit the pacific reply of his Government
to Japan's last note to the Japanese
Foreign Office the Russian Minister for
Foreign Affairs on Friday last sent a
brief note announcing the breaking off
of Far Eastern negotiations, the inter
ruption of diplomatic relations and the
recall of Mr. Kurino, the Japanese Min
ister at St. Petersburg, with the request
that he be furnished his passports
forthwith. In communicating these
facts to the acting Secretary of State,
Count Cassini added that his Govern
ment deplored this turn of the negotia
tions which his Majesty the Emperor
had sincerely hoped might conclude
with a peaceful settlement.
â¢ CONCESSIONS IN THE NOTE.
The Embassador called attention to
the fact that in her last note Russia
had made generous concessions to Ja
pan in Korea and had furnished the
basis for a continuance of the negotia
tions to the advantage of Japan. It
was added that the Russian Govern
ment regarded the action of Japan as
precipitate and remarkable.
Of the final result the Embassador
could only express his opinion that the
worst seemed probable. It was stated
that M. Kurino had received his pass

ital to-morrow. Baro'n de Rosen may
have already left Tokio.
Later in the day cables from Mr. Mc-
Cormlck, the American Embassador at
St. Petersburg, and Mr. Griscom, the
American Minister at Tokio, vere re-,
ceived, by the State Department con
firming tLTj news of the severance of
diplomatic relations. These cable
grams and the communication of the
Russian Embassador were promptly
transmitted to the President.
On high â¢ authority the statement is
made that the Japanese Government
has not yet received the Russian re
ply. Doubt is expressed here whether
it ever will be delivered. Mr. Takahira,
the Japanese Minister, stated to-day
that he was not inclined to attach
great Importance to the charges said
to have been made that the Japanese
Government has shown great haste in
instructing its Ministers, to withdraw
from St. Petersburg before Russia's
reply to Japan's last note had been re
ceived. His Government would doubt
less soon issue a statement explaining
its motives regarding this, as well as
the more important points of the,con
troversy.
CONFERâ fCES IN WASHINGTON.
An official. of the Japanese legation
called attention to the fact, which he
thought significant, that the termina
tion of negotiations was sent to St. Pe
tersburg by th$ Japanese Government
on the 5th IrtsÂ£, while Alexieff tele
graphed. the- reply to the note of Jan
uary 13 to the Russian Minister at
Tokio on the 6th. He said this step
â¦nust have been taken after Admiral
Alexieff was aware of. the notice re
ceived by his Government the day be
fore from Japan, terminating diplo
matic relations.
Baron Sternberg, the German Em
bassador, had a long conference with
Count Cassini at the Russian embassy
this afternoon. ' â  .
The Russian Embassador and the
Japanese Minister here expect to have
a long conference with Secretary Hay
to-morrow. The Russian and Japanese
representatives here will observe out
ward courtesy when they .meet, but
will. not exchange calls.

TOKIO, Feb. 7.â Baron de
Rosen, the Russian Minister, has
arranged to depart from Tokio
next Friday. He will leave Japan
on the French "steamship Yarra,
embarking at Yokohama. The
present plan of Baron de Rosen is
to return to Europe by way of the
Suez canal, proceeding direct to
St. Petersburg from a Meditei
ranean port. His family, the sec
retaries and attaches of the Rus
sian legation and a number of
priests of the Russian church will
accompany him. The party num
bers twenty-five. Austro-Hun
srarian Minister Dambro will as
sume charge of Russian interests
and, take -charge of the legation
property. Many of Baron de Ro
sen's colleagues, including United
States Minister Griscom, and
other friends called at the Russian
legation to-day and bade Baron de
Rosen and his staff farewell.
DE KOSEX DISCOURAGED."
Baron de Rosen is said to be
seriously disappointed and dis
pirited over the outcome of the
negotiations. He strongly advo
cated and strove for peace in the
earlier stage of the negotiations,
but in the later stages his views
were overridden in St. Petersburg
and he merely followed instruc
tions. Personally Baron de Rosen
is very popular among his col
leagues and many Japanese regret
the circumstances necessitating
his departure.
The Japanese Government is
showing the members of the Rus
sian legation every consideration
of courtesy. Police guard the en
trances to the legation and will
carefully escort its members to
Yokohama. The steamer Yarra,
on which the legation is to sail,
also will be closely guarded at
Kobe and Nagasaki in order to
prevent any unpleasant incidents.
With Minister de Rosen will de
part several Russian residents.
All of the Russian commercial
concerns are preparing to close
and transfer their affairs.
GOOD FINANCIAL PROSPECT.
Japanese Minister Kurino has
been instructed by the Japanese
Government to withdraw from St.
Petersburg by Wednesday. It is
expected here that he will with
draw sooner.
The Government's preliminary
estimate places the amount of
money which it is possible to raise
by the domestic sale of war bonds
at 506,000,000 yen. The Govern
ment is much gratified at the
financial prospect.
When Minister of Foreign Af
fairs Komura on Saturday noti
fied Baron de Rosen of Japan's
determination to sever diplomatic
relations he is reported to have
declared to De Rosen that Japan
was tired of Russia's delays, eva
sions and insincerity, and had de
cided to take independent action
for the conservation /'of Japan's
Oriental interests. During the
final negotiations Japan's repeated
requests for an answer were treat
ed in a most unsatisfactory man
ner. Japan waited until con
vinced that it was useless to wait
longer, he said, and had now
ended the discussion.
JAPAN WILL SEIZE KOREA.
The indications are that there
will be no formal declaration of
war. Japan will publicly define
hep position and purposes. .
On Monday Japan will unques
tionably seize Korea, and al
though Russia has previously inti
mated that she would not inter
fere, in view of that country's
present attitude, developments are
eagerly awaited.

liberty satisfied W. C. Tanner and P.

from the United States cruiser Ta

alls and ragged shirts the pair of run
sway seamen surrendered themselves
to-day at the County Jail, Â«ayins they
R-ere tired, hungry and willing to re
turn to the sheltering arms of their
CncJe Samuel. The men tr.ided their
bluejacket uniforms for ihe dunga
rees they wore and got dee'dedly the
worst of the bargain.
As an excuse for the- desertion the
aisgusted sailors said they thought
they were tired of the monotony of
discipline on a man-o'-war, buti that
tired feeling was cured by a few days
of hustling for meals ashore The
naval authorities were notified cf thÂ»
men's arrest.

effect by Mr. Rowlands, with the ac
companiment of an invisible chorus.

tunity to use his resonant barytone in
all of its fullness, and fine technique.

JUST LIKE VICTOR
HUGO'S JEAX VALJEAN
Convict in Xebraska Takes the Hero
of "Les Miscrables" for
n Model.
William Nation, a convict in the Ne
braska penitentiary, | read Victor
Hugo's #< Les Miserables" from the
prison library, and in the solitude of
his cell resolved that what Jean ValÂ»
jean had dene he could do.
His opportunity came. He gained
his liberty under the parole law, and,
like Jean Valjean. he broke his parole
and disappeared.
A month after the- penitentiary doors
at Lnicoln had opened to William Na
tion, William Ritchie appeared at
Grand Island, a big town on the Union
Pacific, 250 miles west of Omaha.
Ritchie -was well dressed, affable,
business-like. He did not make jet
beads and ornaments, for v the people of
Grand Island scorn all such. Being
more practical, he opened a restaurant,
and so conducted it that it was quite
the thing for Grand Island culture and
fashion to dine at Ritchie's.
Ritchie paid his bills promptly and
his word as well as his note was good
at the bank. He married a pretty
young widow. Mrs. Gustave Ehlers,
and his popularity grew. â¦
But the Javerts of the Lincoln peni
tentiary were as persistently on the
track of William Nation as was the
Javert of "Les Miserables" in pursuit
of Jean Valjean. And just as Javert
found Valjean behind the barricade In
the red days of a Paris revolt, just so
the Javerts of Lincoln found William
Ritchie in his restaurant at Grand Isl
and. And when they had found him
they placed him under arrest and car
ried him back to the penitentiary be
cause he had broken his parole.
Mrs. Ritchie, or Mrs. Nation, as she
mutt no\v be called, accompanied her
husband to prison and then went to the
Statehouse to intercede with Governor
Mickey. The Governor, it is believed,
will either grant Convict Nation a new
parole, which will enable him to return
to Grand Island, or will pardon him
unconditionally. /
Nation was sentenced to prison.for
three years and his term had nearly
expired when he was paroled for the
first time.â Chicago Inter Ocean.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, FEBRUARY. 8, 190S.
GIVES SURPLUS
TO CHARITIES
Directors of Oakland Street
Fair Issue a Statement
and Close- Their Accounts
ITS INCOME DISAPPOINTING
But Nine Hundred Dollars Re
main for Distribution A^ter
All the Expenses Are Paid
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Feb. 7.
The Oakland Street Fair and Carni
val Association has closed its accounts
and the directors of the association
have prepared a statement to the pub
lic, showing the reasons why the last
street fair was not as successful as the
one given by the Elks during the pre
vious year.
The statement is supported by an
expert who was put to work upon the
books and an auditing committee that
passed upon the work of both. This
statement shows that the expense of
preparing the grounds for the carnival
was much greater than was anticipat
ed in the beginning, as the price of
labor and materih.1 had greatly in
creased, and. as the area was mu6h
larger than a't the Elks' fair, the out
lay in building, fencing and decorating
was increased accordingly.
The electric display was one of the
finest ever seen on the Pacific Coast
and this also added greatly to the ex
pense of the fair. Altogether, the total
cost of the last street fair was about
$30,000.
The attendance at the first street fair
was 130,000, while- that at the second
was but 112,000. and while the Elks'
fair was only kept open for one .week
the second fair ran for eleven days.
The expense of the ektra four days
added materially to the total enpense
of the carnival.
In spite of all these adverse circumr
stances there was a surplus of $900
after all accounts had been closed, and
this will be distributed among charita
ble organizations of this city. The
charities that will be benefited by this
donation are the Ladles' Relief Society,
the Fred Finch Orphanage, the Colored
People's Home, the Social Settlement,
St. Joseph's Home and the German
Ladies' Relief Society.
The executive committee voted $2500
to Director General Max Schlueter and
this action was fully approved by the
board of directors, which thoroughly
appreciated the work done by Mr.
Schlueter in making the fair the suc
cess it was.
When the second street fair was 'first
planned the matter was in the hands
of the local lodge of Elks, which had
so successfully conducted the carnival
jof the previous year, but before the ar-
Yangements were completed the Grand
Lodge had issued an order forbidding
any subordinate lodge to conduct a
street fair. So much had already been
done, however, that the directors felt
that they co-uld not abandon the enter
prise, so the Oakland Street Fair and
Carnival Association was organized
and Incorporated and the stock was
sold to citizens and members of the
Elks as individuals. That the second
fair was not as great a financial suc
cess? as the first was through no fault
of the members of the association, but
rather because public interest had
partly died out and the expense of con
ducting the enterprise was 'much great
er than anticipated.

Very Easy for Her.
A "woman's reason," with all Its
traditional lack of logic, came out in
an amusing fashion at a recent dinner
party in Brooklyn. â 
In the course of the evening the con
versation drifted around to those odd
little mathematical bits of the How
old-Is-Ann variety, when one of the
company, with explanations .- that the
next problem would not be a very diffi
cult one, questioned as follows: .' ' /
"If a bottle and; a cork together
cost $1 10, and the bottle costs a dollar
more than the cork, how much did the
cork cost?"
Almost instantly one of the ladies
was ready with the answer:
"Why, the cork cost 5 cents and
the bottle ?1 05. That's tooÂ«easy.V ; -
The lady's husband, familiar through
years of experience with her woeful
lack of skill in figures, looked up in
astonishment. /
"Heavens!" he exclaimed. "How'did
you come to get that so soon?".
"Why, my dear," was the reply,
"corks always cost 5 ' cents, don't'
they?" â New York Times.

DRUGGIST IS AFTER HIM
It Is Said That Fear of Ar

to Flee the College Town
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call.
â¢ 2148 Center Street, Feb. 7.
Dr. Gardner Howell. the man that
wooed and won Miss Bessie. Bash of
2134'Woolsey street in three days, has
forsaken his wife and even his parents
in-law. His wife, no longer hoping for
his return, has taken to earning her
own living by clerking in a South
Berkeley dry goods store.'
The incentive for Dr. Howell's dis
appearance is said to be his fear of
Edward Noble, who keeps a pharmacy
at 3027 Adeline street. Noble accuses
the doctor of stealing from him a bot
tle of cocaine worth $1 50 and he has
applied to â¢ the Justice's Court for a
warrant for his arrest. The druggist's
only ground for the accusation is that
the cocaine disappeared at the same
time the doctor did. As this appeared
to Justice Edgar a little flimsy, he re
fused . to issue a warrant, but Noble
vows he will not let up In his prose
cution of Dr. Howell.
Mrs. Howell is the daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. Jacob Bash of Woolsey
street. She had no thought of marry
ing until three days after she met Dr.
Howell. Her mother had introduced
them. Mrs. Bash, it seems, met Dr.
Howell on the Overland t/ain coming
across the continent. He told her he
was a New York physician traveling
around the world and made such an
impression that she invited him to her
Berkeley home. There the doctor met
Miss Bash and from all accounts it was
a case of love at first sight.
It was announced then that Dr.
Howell would take his wife with with
him for the rest of the way around the
world. They were to start on Decem
ber 27, but they did not. Instead, Dr.
Howell disappeared for two days while
they . were staying at the Touraine
Hotel in Oakland and his wife thought
he had deserted her. But he bobbea
up a day or so later at the Bash home.
He explained that a message he had
sent from San Francisco informing his
wife that he had been suddenly taken
ill had miscarried.

1118 Broadway, Feb. 7.
Miner Allseits. the Berkeley lad that
was shot on the morning of New Years
day at the South Berkeley fire house
by Otto Simon, is still alive, and it Js
asserted that he will recover.
The fact that Allseits has lived for
more than a month is in itself remark- â¢
abl-, owinc t'J the character of the
wound. The bullet went through the
right lobe of the liver and lodged in
the back, just under the skin. It has
been extracted and the external
wounds are healing nicely.
Simon, who shot Allseits. is still in
the County Jail, awaiting the result of
Allseits' wound. It was expected for
a long time that the wounded man
would die, in which case Simon would
have been charged with murder, but it
is said by the friends of the injured
man that if he recovers there will be
no prosecution.

quested a reply and a reply was prom
ised, but it ncvertame. At the begin
ning of last week M. Kurino declared
positively that he must have a reply,
but still there was nothing.
"At the same time Russia continued
to make military preparations and to
concentrate troops in the vicinity of
the Yalu River. Can you not conceive
the inquietude and the irritation at
Tokio? After three weeks of patience
we thought that was sufficient and our
dignity would not permit us to wait
indefinitely."
JAPAN* ANXIOUS FOR CLASH.
A Russian diplomatic authority here
says that while the Russian reply was
sent from St. Petersburg Thursday, It
had not reached Tokio yet. Japan
wished for a rupture, and the order
given M. Kurino to break off diplomatic
relations coincided with the departure
of the Russian note, a departure which
had been predicted and announced.
"Is that not significant?" the author
ity in question asked.
"Yesterday at 6 o'clock M. Kurino
made known to Count LamsdorfC the
instructions that reached him on the
5th. At the same time that M. Kurino
notified Count Lamsdorff. Baron Ko
mura announced the news to Baron de
Rosen and requested him to depart. It
is not because the Russian note did not
arrive yesterday that relations were
broken off. If in reality the relations
were terminated because Japan did not
receive our note, then the only deduc
tion which can be made on this point
is that Japan, knowing in what state of
ccnciliation our reply was prepared, de
cided to avoid further negotiations.
When Japan had waited two weeks,
she could have waited twenty-four
hours longer."
Continuing:, this authority said the
Japanese had . concentrated their fleet
and transports, that they had broken
off diplomatic relations and that their
intention was evident. "Whatever their
intention might be, Russia would await
the course of events without inquietude.
KOREA AND ITS STATUS
The Associated Press was the first to
give tho news of Japan's action to the
Korean Minister here. It was evident
that the Minister had little doubt that
war would follow: He said:
"My Government will advise me of
the policy it proposes to pursue. You
know, and the world knows, that Korea
means to observe a policy of strict
neutrality, and it will do all in its power
to enforce such neutrality. We have
hoped that war would be avoided, for
we have appreciated what hostilities
would mean to our country."
"But in case Japanese troops land in
Korea will your Government appeal to
the powers?" the Minister was asked..
To this the Korean representative re
plied: "My advices do not show what
action will be taken, except that Korea
will remain neutral."
The attitude of France in the pres
ence of this grave Russo-Japanese
emergency is a subject of the deepest
concern among officials. Naturally no
declaration laying down the govern
mental policy is forthcoming, although
it is expected that M. Delcasse will
during the week make a statement in
the Chamber of Deputies clearly out
lining the French position.
In the meantime the general line of
French policy as gathered from the
most authoritative sources is as fol
lows:
France undoubtedly will maintain
strict neutrality, and she will endeavor
In every way to keep free from all pos
sible entanglements which might draw
her into hostilities. This Is primarily
due to the belief of French officials that
France has no deep interest involved
in the region in dispute. Her direct in
terests are too far from the scene of ac
tion to make war a matter of special
concern to France. â¢
Officials have carefully considered
just how far France is likely to be
come involved under the terms of the
Franco- Russian alliance, which, they
say, contains two distinct safeguards
limiting French participitation. The
first of these is that Russia must be
attacked and the second that this at
tack must be by two powers. The re
quirement that Russia be attacked has
been one of the chief causes of Rus
sia's temporizing, as she has not
wished to sacrifice the chances of
French support. Officials here, how
ever, have believed and hoped that
Russia would strike the first decisive
blow, as such action would in a meas
ure relieve France from participating
in^a profitless war.
BRITAIN NOT TO INTERFERE.
Concerning the condition in the al
liance providing that two powers must
attack Russia before France becomes
involved, Delcasse has distinctly stated
to members of the diplomatic corps
that Korea and China would not be
considered such powers if either joined
Japan against Russia. The only re
maining powers likely to assist Japan
against Russia are Great Britain and.
the United States. Regarding Great
Britain the official belief here is that
she does not desire to be embroiled,
owing to her recent experience in
South Africa and possible Russian
complications in India, Moreover, as
was pointed out by a leading diplo
matist to-night, if Great Britain be
came embroiled she would be com
pelled to hold the larger portion of
the British fleet at home in order to
prevent her ports being blockaded and
her food supplies stopped by France,
wh09e participation would naturally
follow Great Britain's aiding Japan.
Furthermore, the recent Franco-Brit
ish arbitration treaty has been pro
ductive of a strong sentiment of amity
between the two nations and this is
thought to counteract much of the
former sentiment favorable to Russia.
Besides being written in the treaty, M.
Delcasse, Lord Lans/lowne and others
of the highest Influence in British and
French official life have lately em
phasized this restoration of friendly
relations and there is reason to believe
that these exchanges have resulted in
a pretty definite understanding that un
der no circumstances will either
France or Great Britain be drawn into
.the Russo-Japanese conflict.
That *he United States might possi
bly be the second power to attack Rus
sia, thus necessitating French action,
is regarded as an extremely remote
possibility and practically impossible,
and, furthermore, the cordiality be
tween France and the United States is
a powerful offset to any French senti
ment toward Russia.
FRANCE WILL HOLD ALOOF.
One of the best posted "TTuthorlties
said to-night that, notwithstanding
any alliance, the French Parliament
would never authorize war in connec
tion with the present t'ispute. This
authority pointed out that, after the
coup d'etat of Napoleon III by precipi
tating the Franco-German War with
out consulting the legislative branch,
France adopted the salutary principle
of the American constitution, which
makes Parliament the sole body capa
ble of declaring war. At the present
time the French Parliament is strongly
made u- of Socialists and one of their
cardinal principles is disarmament, ar
bitration and the avoidance of warfare.
This element holds the balance of power
in the French Parliament and It stands,
therefore, as ; a distinct assurance
against a Parliamentary declaration of
war. â¢ ' .-â 
Trobably the best outward evidence
that Franco '"?as no expe-.tatlon of be-
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, FEBRUARY S, 1904.
coming involved in the Far East is
that only one French warship has been
sent there and that not a single addi
tional soldier has been ordered to the
extreme Orient.
As to the probable course of the oth
er powers toward the belligerents, the
press has been informed by the highest
German authority in France that Ger
many will maintain an attitude of neu
trality. Although her sympathies lean
toward Russia, she has no intention of
aiding Russia materially, for she be
lieves that Russia will be victorious.
As Germany's interests are not men
aced, she will simply be a spectator;
but If anything should be. done which
Germany might consider as affecting
her she will be prepared to act. It is
said that Germany has no intention of
seizing Shantung and it is declared to
be ridiculous to suppose that she pro
poses to occupy any points in Den
mark.
AUSTRIA IS PRO-RUSSIA.
Austria, it is believed, will follow the
course of Germany, because of the tri
ple alliance and from her neighborly
interests with Russia, particularly in
the Balkans. Italy Is expected to
maintain practically the same position
as her associates in the triple alliance,
although, since the agitation resulting
in the Czar's canceling his trip to
Rome, there has been a notable lack
of enthusiasm in Italy for Russia.
The Balkans are considered the dan
ger spot of Europe. As a result of the
pre-occupation of Russia in the Far
East, it is known here that she has
been careful not to draw upon the
troops in European Russia to any
great extent for service in Manchuria,
because of the prospect that. Turkey
and Bulgaria will engage in war during
the spring.
Austria will bear the burden, in the
greater degree, of preserving peace In
Europe. In this, however, she will be
earnestly supported by France and
Great Britain and, it is hoped, by Ger
many and Italy.
BRITONS ARE APPREHENSIVE.
Japan's 3Iove to Be Discussed at Cab
inet Meeting in London.
LONDON, Feb. 7.â News of the Rus
so-Japanese rupture reached London
late this afternoon, and* only a few
newspapers published extra editions
giving the. announcement. However, as
this outcome had been accepted as al
most Inevitable for several days past
the actual announcement created no
great excitement.
An official of the Russian embassy
said that it was true that the breaking
off of diplomatic relations was a most
serious step, but there was always a
possibility'of avoiding eventualities un
til the first shot has been fired.
The British Cabinet will meet to-mor
row in response to a summons issued
last Friday, and it will have a grave
situation to discuss because of the
many indications of the probability
cf trouble in the Far East. There is
also an almost equally grave crisis in
the Near East.
Premier Balfour will be unable to
preside at the council. His illness Is
causing some disquietude. He has de
veloped bronchial irritation and a
troublesome cough. The Premier's
strength, however, is well maintained.
According to the latest statements,
however, he probably will not be able
to resume his duties for a fortnight.
King Edward to-day granted an au
dience to Lord Roberta and Lord
Charles Beresford, commander of the
channel fleet, with whom was dis
cussed the Far Eastern crisis. State
ments of the Japanese case similar to
the one issued in Paris have been
made, also in London, Berlin and
other capitals.
As a result of the rupture of diplo
matic relations Japan neither seeks
nor expects an immediate outbreak of
hostilities. She trusts the China-Amer
ican treaty will maintain the open door
and the status quo In Manchuria, and
she has prepared herself to watch the
attitude of Russia In Northern Korea,
She will not, however, land troops in
Korea without a distinct violation of
the Korean frontier, in which event she
is prepared to act promptly.
The St. Petersburg correspondent of
the Reuter Telegram Company cables
that a special edition of the Novoe
Vremya announced the breaking off of
diplomatic relations between Japan and
Russia. In an editorial this paper
throws the onus for the rupture on Ja
pan, saying that "for three months
Russia has been examining the Japa
nese proposals in the most amicable
spirit in the hope of finding a way to
make all possible concessions without
injuring Russia's prestige, and she has
remained unmoved by the slanders that
she was delaying the negotiations with
the object of completing war prepara
tions. As it turns out," the paper goe3
on, "the whole exchange of notes was
a farce. Japan, and not Russia, only
awaited the moment when the two
cruisers bought in Italy reached Chi
nese waters. The Japanese then threw
off their mask, not even awaiting Rus
sia's reply. They have shown them
selves to be Asiatics and unable to ob
serve even the slightest decency. His
tory knows no case of similar beha
vior. We are convinced that public
opinion in Russia will give the Jap
anese a suitable reply.
"The rupture of diplomatic relations
does not necessarily mean war. His
tory shows cases of a diplomatic rup
ture having lasted for years without
resulting in war, but such instances
are rare. The normal course of af
fairs means either war or the medi
ation of other powers. We thus stand
between three alternatives â war,
mediation or long oerlod of friction,
and the last Is the least probable.
The interests of both powers are too
far, opposed to admit of their being
brought in accord during the de facto
occupation of territory. Mediation is
also improbable and there remains
but the ultimate ratio 'regum (the
final argument of kings) â war. One
thing only seems certain â after the
steps taken yesterday by the Japanese
no honorable foreigner will think it
possible to accuse us of an- aggressive
attitude.
"Russia stands at the threshhold of
great events. Every son of Russia,
without distinction of convictions, will
to-day conscientiously and sincerely
say: 'Japan has herself willed it; so
let it be; God be with us. 1 "
Such expressions as the "possibility
of avoiding hostilities" receives scant
attention in London, and nobody be
lieves but that fighting will begin al
most immediately.
The British press displays a very full
appreciation of the delicate and diffi
cult problems facing the government,
owing to the alliance with Japan, and
much questioning is indulged in as- to
whether the Ministers have fully
weighed their responsibilities.

PARIS, Feb. 8. â A dispatch to the

WILD RUMORS AFLOAT.
Amid the. crop, of stories afloat
here to-day thÂ«eLare some of the
wildest character, as, for exam
ple, that a naval battle has already
been fought and a Japanese fleet
sunk. Another, story, which is
repeated clearly and circumstan
tially, is thatj while the Japanese
Government did not wait for the
official reception of the Russian
response, the contents of it were
communicated privately to Ku
rino, who telegraphed it to his
Government. - This, the press has
been authoritatively informed, is
not true.
When Count Lamsdorff in
formed Kutfino on Thursday night
that the response had gone to
Viceroy Alexieff he did not give
him a copy of it, btVt, it is under
stood, he made known in a gen
eral way the Russian position.
Russia, while making conces
sions, declined to yield on the fol
lowing four points :
1. Japan's right to ask for a
treaty covering the sovereignty of
Manchuria.
2. She insisted' 'upon mutual
recognition of the independence of
Korea.
3. That there should be no for
tification of Southern Korea,
which miglft threaten Russian
communication with Port Arthur
and Vladivostok.
4. She declined to meet Japan's
wishes with regard to a neutral
zone on both sides of the Yalu
River.
PATRIOTISM IS AROUSED.
The news of the breaking off of
diplomatic relations between Rus
sia and Japan was spread far and
wide throughout the capital by ex
tra bulletins of the Novoe Vremya
and other papers. Much excite
ment was created and this resulted
in patriotic demonstrations.
At the performance of Telinka's
"Life for the Czar" at the Marie
Theater the enormous building
was packed from floor to ceiling,
many military officers being pres
ent. When the peasant Sousain,
who in the play comes to save the
Czar's life, sang the national ode,
"God Save the Czar From His
Enemies,"/the emotional Russian
character was stilled by the solem
nity of the occasion, but when the
curtain was rung down the au
dience burst into vociferous ap
plause.
The Bourse Gazette hails the
breaking off of relations because
it terminates the suspense and de
clares that the entire nation will
respond to the imperial call.
It is the general opinion of mili
tary men here that Japan will im
mediately land troops in Korea,
whence will come the first news
of the fighting, unless there should
be an accidental encounter at sea.
The press was informed at a
late hour to-night that the order
for the imperial train to take the
Czat to Moscow had been coun
termanded and that the date of
his Majesty's departure is uncer
tain.
COLDNESS BETWEEN ATTACHES.
Representatives of Russia and Japan
Have Long Been Unfriendly.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 7.-During the
last year of the strained relations be
tween Russia and Japan the Russian
and Japanese representatives here have
not been at all intimate, despite the
fact that they meet frequently at of
ficial arid social functions. At the New
Y.ear reception they merely exchanged
formal greetings. At' the diplomatic
reception, a week later, Colonel Rospo
pow, a Russian military attache, bowed
to an attache of the Japanese lega
tion and only received a stony stare in
reply.
At the diplomatic dinner, when Count
Cassini came almost face to face with
the Japanese Minister, no greeting of
any kind was exchanged, but close ob
servers noticed that a moment later
Count Cassihi in a recess of the Blue
room quietly approached Mr. Takahira
and spoke with marked emphasis to
him. The colloquy lasted but a mo
ment. x
Close by was a European diplomat,
from whom it is now learned that
Count Cassini told the Japanese Min
ister emphatically that although there
were strained 'relations between their
countries there was no reason why
there should not be ordinary polite in
tercourse between the Minister of Ja
pan and the dean of the diplomatic
corps.

MOB BURNS

Xegro and His Wife Pay
Penalty for the Killing of
a White Planter on a
Plantation in Mississippi
THOUSAND MEN SEE
LIVES ENDED IN FIRE
I Jâ
Burning 'of Accused Persons the
Terrible Close of a. Tragic
Occurrence in Which Eight
Deaths Have Been Recorded
. DODDSVTLLE, Miss., Feb. 7.âLu
ther Holbert and his wife, negroes,
were burned at tne stake" here to-day
by a mob of 1000 persons for the killing
of James Eastland, a prominent whita
planter, and John Carr, a negro, on
Wednesday at the Eastland plantation,
two -miles from this city.
The burning of Holbert and his wlfa
closes a tragedy which has cost elgl\t
lives, has engaged 200 men and two
packs of bloodhounds in a four days*
chase across four counties and has
stirred this section of Mississippi al
most to frenzy. Following are the
dead: Luther Holbert and wife, ne
groes, burned at the stake by mob;
James Eastland, white, planter, killed
by Holbert: John Carr, negro, killed by
Holbert: John 1 Winters, negro, killed
by Eastland; three unknown negroes,
killed by posses. '
The killing of Eastland, Carr and
Winters occurred Wednesday at East
land's plantation. Holbert and Win
ters were in Carr's cabin, when East
land entered and ordered Holbert to
leave the plantation. A difficulty en
sued, in which it is alleged that Hol
bert opened fire on Eastland, fatally
wounding him and killing Carr. East
land returned the fire and killed Win
ters. *
When the news of the tragedy reached
Doddsville a posse was formed and .left
immediately for Eastland's plantation.
Arriving there, further shooting oc
curred and an unknown negro was
killed. Holbert and his wife, who had
donned man's clothing, both heavily
armed, had fled.
Posses were formed at Greenville,
Cleveland and other points, and the
pursuit of Holbert and his wife was
begun with horses and bloodhounds.
The chase, which was begun Wednes
day morning, was continued until last
night, when Holbert and his wife, worn
out from traveling 100 miles on foot j
through canebrakes and swamps, werej
found asleep in a heavy belt of timber
three miles east of Shepardstown and
captured by a posse without a shot be
ing fired. The two negroes were brought
to Doddsville and this afternoon were
burned at the stake by a mob almost in
the shadow of the negro church here.
Yesterday two negroes were killed by
a posse near Belzoni, Yazoo County.
One of the negros bore a striking re
semblance to Holbert and was mis
taken for him by members, of the posse.
He was called on to surrender, but in
stead of 'doing so, showed fight and
both negroes were shot down by posse
men, as Holbert had sworn he would
not be taken alive and was known to
be heavily armed.
Eastland was a member of a
wealthy Mississippi family and a re
ward â¢ of $1200 was offered by
relatives for the capture . of his
slayer alive. Two brothers of
Eastland participated In the chase
and capture of the Holberts and both
were present when Holbert and his wife
were burned.
The 16-year-old son of Holbert, who
was captured Friday night and held
on suspicion of complicity in the kill
ing of Eastland, was given his free
dom, his innocence being established.
SURPRISE IX BERLIN.
Ambassador of the Czar Learns of the
Action of Jar>an.
BERLIN, Feb. 7. â Count f von der
Osten-Sacken, the Russian Embassa
dor at Berlin, received Count Lams
dorfCIs â  official circular at 2 o'clock
this morning, but did not communi
cate it to Baron von Richthofen, the
imperial Secretary, until 9 o'clock this
morning. The Russian Embassador
was received by Baron Richthofen
while he was taking coffee in his dress
ing-room. Later in the day Count von
der Osten-Sacken saw Baron von
Ilichthofen again and presumably told
him of a supplementary dispatch say
ing that the Russian Government did
not know whether there would be war
or not.
Callers at the Russian Embassy
were assured by the Embassador that
the action of Japan was a painful
surprise and that the embassy had no
intelligence on which to base a pre
diction as to what the Russian and
Japanese Governments would next do.
The Japanese Minister at Berlin, In
ouye, looking as impassive and calm
as usual, drove out this afternoon.
Baron von. Richthofen took the
original of the Russian dispatch to
Count Bulow, Imperial Chancellor,
who, in turn, personally took it to the
Schloss and handed it to the Emperor
on his Majesty's return from church.
It is quite likely that the Emperor, in
the event of war, would give up his
proposed cruise through the Mediter
ranean in order to be at home to meet
any complications.
Count von Bulow only a short time
ago told several persons that war was
wholly out of the question. The War
Office appears to have taken a differ
ent, view from the Foreign Office re
garding the >. possibilities of war, be
cause early last week a military at
tache was ordered to join the Russian
forces in the Far East:

INSTRUCTIVE STUDIES
BY NOTED MEN AND
WOMEN
For the Stage-Struck.
BY JESSIE BARTLETT DAVIS.
(Prim* Pona.)
(Copyright. 19<"H. ty Joseph B. Bowles.)
A great many girls think that the
battle for success is more than half
von as soon as they get a position with
a theatrical or opertaio company. There
never was a more erroneous impression.
The battle has only begun when the
girl gets in the chorus or is given a
email part. It becomes then a case of
the survival of the fittest. I have seen
splendid voices stay in the chorus for
ten years. Many girls find after once
they have been given a chance that it
means hard work to forge ahead.
A soprano who kad a small part with
the Bostor.ians once said to me: "Mrs.
Davis, you make me tired going out
there night after night, when I know
you"re sic-k and working so h?rd. You
bet I don't do that. When I don't feel
well I don't work hard." *
**Ah. my dear," I said, "you must
love your public. You must work, and
work hard, if you would succeed. Your
audience doesn't know when you are
ill. It expects you to do your best al
ways. You will not get very far if you
keep on as you have started."
My prophecy was only too true. One
year after we had this conversation
the soprano had retired from the stage.
I believe she married.
When I was playing in "Fatinitza"
some years ago there was a girl in the
chorus who had a magnificent contralto
voice. She was a good girl, and I liked
her. I wanted to see her get ahead.
One day I said to her. "Why don't you
study my part? You learn the songs,
the words and the business, and some
day I'll give, you a chance to go on at
aniatit.e*. That will give you .111 op
portunity to advance, and me a much
needed rest."
But she said it would moan too much
work. She was still in the chorus the
last time I saw her.
In order to succeed a singer must
enjoy her work and the enjoyment
must ::ot be affected; it must be
real. Shs must feel a certain in
describable sympathy with aer audi
ence. She must love her public, love
to work for it. When I go out on the
stajre I always feel as if I were singing
for some one out in front who is very
dear to me.
Once Digby Bell said to me: "It is
absolutely necessary for me to pick out
a pleasant face in the audience and
work to and for that face." There is
a great deal in that.
A singer can tell instantly if her audi
ence is interested. It is almost impos
sible 10 make a success of a song if the
audience is not in sympathy. I have
worked like a Trojan to wake up a
slow, sleepy assemblage. It is not al
ways possible to do that, but often per
severance and determination will warm
up even the most icy crowd. A singer
must learn what to do with cold audi
ences. When she goes before the foot
lights and sees in front of her a sea of
faces that appear to say to her, "I dare
you to entertain us," it means work,
work, work. â¢
The value of a smile cannot be over
estimated. If the singer shows by her
attitude, by her pleasant face, that she
is going to enjoy her work her audi
ence is at once predisposed in her fa
vor. Even the homeliest face may be
come divinely fair if illuminat-d with
a smile. If your audience thinks you
are pleased it is pleased, too. Sometimes
I think that the magnetism of a singer
or an actress is merely her love for her
public. Instead of being in the singer
the magnetism is in the audience.
Individuality counts for much in a
singer. Many a woman has made a suc
cess of an otherwise dreary opera by
sheer force of her own personality. This
is what managers are seeking. Let your
ingenuity and your brains work out
things. If you have good taste and
good sense the manager will be pleased
and he will let you alone. An opera
singer cannot expend too much time on
her costumes. When I took the part of
Vladimir in "Fatinitza" it had been
played for years. But I had a different
conception cf the role and a different
idea of how to dress the part. I had to
fight with the manager before he would
let me have rny own way in designing
costumes, but in the end he gave me a
free rein. The result was when I made
my apperance on the stage there was a
prolonged "Ah" from the audience.
That is what a Finger must have, that
"ah." When you get that on your first
appearance you know that you have in
terested your audience. And the first
interest means worlds for you.
In the last act of "Robin Hood,"
Alan-a-Dale, the character I played so
many, many times, comes on masque
rading in a monk's gown, looking for
W s sweetheart. When the part of Alan
was riven to me I wanted a costume
for the last act which should consist
of white silk tights, a white doublet
studded with jewels ar*d a cloak of
white broadcloth. Mr. . Barnaby. cer
tainly a veteran of the stage and a
man well versed in the art of pleasing
the public/ advised against the. broad
cloth. T>ut the cloak of broadcloth was
made and I wore it under the monk's
parment. The first night, when Alan
threw off his masquerade costume and
disclosed himself all in white there was
a lone chorus cf surprised "Ahs." Af
ter the performance Mr. Barnaby came
to me and said: "Well, you got the 'Ah*
you were looking for."
A contralto wLo goes on the stage
must make up her mind to wear tights.
There Is a sort of tradition that con
traltos must be cast for men's or boys'
roles. The librettist naturally chooses
the soprano for his heroine, the tenor
for his' hero. We have come to regard
it altogether wrong for a basso to
make love to a contralto. When I first
went into vaudeville in Chicago I wore
skirts for the first .time on any stage.
And they were a great annoyance to
meâ always getting in the way.
Once a meeting of women â I think it
was at Chautauquaâ chose me for their
Ideal stage woman. But they said:
"What a pity that .Mrs. Davis wears
tights!" This was published in some
of the newspapers and brought a re
porter to me. He asked me how it
seemed to wear tightsâ how I felt when
I was playing men's roles.
"I never think anything about it,"
was my reply. "When I play a man's
part I am a man for the time being. I
never think anything about the cos
tume."
One gets used to wearing tights as
one grows accustomed to wearing long
dresses. It makes no difference to a
sjnger. Of course it might worry a per
son to don fleshings after she had been
appearing in long skirts for many
years. In that regard, it is to one's ad
vantage to begin early on the stage,
before the age of self -consciousness
begins. For that matter, the American
public Is now so used to seeing women
in tights that an audience is surprised
not to find some of the-principals, or at
least the chorus, thus appareled.
Food for Iitz'alids.
13 Y MART TATI>OR ROSS. |
(HouFehold Expert.)
â¢ CorSTight. 1904. by Joseph B. Bowles >
Very often when the physician orders
raw eggs to be given to the patient the
nurse experiences the greatest difficul
ty in, persuading the invalid to take <
them. In some cases the thought of <
swallowing a raw eggs causes nausea, I
in itself; many make an effort to I
"down them," and when they are half !
swallowed find the task .00 difficult, j
The same general remarks that apply [
to all catering for invalids apply to the
serving of raw eggs. The sense of smell
is acute when one is ill, and both smell
and taste become very sensitive, hence j
everything connected with the prepar
ing and serving of food must be sweet
and clean, and dainty in appearance as
well as fact.
Use the thinnest of glasses for the j
egg mixtures, and always rub the edge J
of a glass with a bit of lemon peel, or j
orange if the lemon is not at hand, for j
a raw egg is apt to have an unpleasant \
odor. Add the seasoning and flavoring
with a sparing hand, and, if the patient
is apt to be "finicky." r How him to
a_.d these for himself, carrying in a
little of each in a small saucer on the
side of the tray. Use only distilled
water in preparing anything ihat re
quires water- for the best that
can be obtained is none too good for
one who is ill. It is needless to say
that the silver used should be bright,
and washed just before using, so it will
be immaculate; it takes but a moment
to scald and dry spoons, knives and
forks, and then one is sure they have !
no unpleasant odor. Then, too, the |
silver is slightly warmed when this is j
done, and it is more important than
one would think that the silver might
be of such a temperatur â¢ that it will j
not chill one the moment it is touched.
Below are given two recipes for the
serving of raw eggs to invalids. Both
have been made use of over and over
again, so that one need have no" fear of
trying them.
Frothed or whipped eggsâ This is i
one of the commonest forms of raw <
egg nourishment advised for invalids, j
for it can be taken when the stomach I
is too weak to digest the hardened por
tion of the white of a cooked egg.
Separate the white from the yolk of
a really fresh egg. Turn it into a plat- j
' ter and beat it with a silver fork until
it is very, very stiff and white. Add
a little salt or sugar, as the case may j
be. ar.d turn it into a dainty little bowl j
or egg cup, heaping it roughly in the !
middle. Sometimes a little flavoring
of brandy or a few drops of lemon
juice will make this more palatable.
Eg:, nr- Next to the egg frath this
is the commonest and best-known form
of raw egg nourishment. Have the egg
fresh, the milk new and the utensils
immaculate before commencing to pre
pare it, and do not forget the pinch
of salt to remove the flat taste. Sepa
rate the white and yolk of an egg; stir
rhe yolk In the bottom of a tumbler
with a little sugar and salt and pour
over it a little milk. Whip* the white
of the egg till very stiff and then strain
the yolk and milk mixture through a
small wire sieve, so there will be no
whole particles of yolk nor any of the
"spiral spring" that holds the yolk and
white together and is apt to make a
raw egg drink stringy. Now fill up
the glass and add the egg white and
then pass the egg nog rapidly from one
large glass to another. If brandy,
rum or whisky is to be added,' stir the
given Quantity into the milk and rub
the edge of the glass with a bit of
lemon. A small bit 0? the peel can float
on the top, where it will remove any
odor of ratv egg that, might prove dis
agreeable. If a large quantity of liquor
is to be used it is well to add a little
charged water to the milk, and. in any
case, many a patient can take a raw
egg nourishment when a little charged
water is used in making who would
refuse it when made of milk alone. Hot
egg nog is made by scalding the milk,
and. after beating the jwhite to a stiff
froth, stirring in the yolk, and pour
ing the hot milk over all, stirring the
egg constantly, so as to keep it liquid. 1
Toss back and forth from tumbler to
tumbler and serve either hot or cold.
On no account are the yolks and
whites of eggs to be beaten together
for any of these recipes; eggs are' more
easily digested when beaten separately,
and the difference in flavor is easily
perceptible to a trained or to a capri
cious appetite.

THE great staples had the floor last week. Not for

citement all along the line. â Cotton, coffee, wheat
and corn were the objects of speculative trading, which
was sensational and frequently frenzied, as in the case of
cotton, which broke so sharply and continuously that
fortunes were swept away in an hour and even less.
Toward the cfose of the week the liquidation became so
acute that thousands of bales, nobody apparently know
ing where they came from, were thrown on the market,
and the rush to sell became a panic which the bulls were
unable to check. Rumors of a near approach of war be
tween Russia and Japan added fuel to the already fierce
fire, and on one day there were three callers on the Cot
ton Exchange owing to the nervous collapse through ex
haustion of the regular caller and an emergency substi
tute who followed him.
The break in this staple occurred just when the pre
vious decline in prices was promising a welcome improve
ment in the cotton manufacturing industry. Many mills
in the South and abroad had shut down owing to the
scarcity and high cost of- the raw material, and these
were preparing to resume, while wholesalers' stocks had
become so depleted that buyers were again entering the
market in spite of the high quotations to replenish their
assortments. But the aggravation of the decline drove
all these buyers out of the market again, the confusion
became worse confounded and the press dispatches tell
us that thousands of people lined the street, watching
the brokers trying to scramble into the center of the pit
to offer their cotton. It was a great week in this staple.
Coffee, too, had its innings, and under enormous sales
broke, largely in sympathy with the panic in cotton,
though the week's statement, showing a decrease of 445,
000 bags in- the world's visible supply in January, steadied
the market somewhat. Wheat and corn on the Chicago
Board of Trade were more active than for a long time
and fluctuated several points a day under trading, which
was always large and at times sensational, these markets
being governed largely by the varying complexion of the
war news^ from the Orient. In short the speculator in
any of the above staples found no difficulty in getting all
the excitement he wanted and without any notice what
ever.
In the other staples there was more activity than for
some time, but without especial excitement. Provisions
ruled Vather quiet than otherwise. The tendency in hog
products was' downward rather than upward, as the
Southern speculators found themselves loaded with the
goods and with a panicky cotton market to aggravate the
situation. The packers have been loading up these specu
lators with pork products for some time, as frequently
mentioned of late. Wool was firm, with light stocks and
higher prices at London. The New England footwear
factories report plenty of business in sight, but they com
plain of scarcity of leather and the increased cost 4 of pro
duction. The reports from the iron and steel trades are
no worse than they have been of late and in some respects
they are better. The production has again increased, the
demand is now larger than a month ago and some quota
tions have been advanced.
The distributive trade of the country has again been
restricted by extreme cold weather, which has stimulated
the demand for winter clothing and other necessaries,
but has seriously hindered railroad transportation. Trad
reports are irregular and the best are coming in from the
South, where the high prices for cotton have led to a
prospective large increase in the acreage for the coming
season, which in turn has increased the demand for farm
ing implements, stock and fertilizers, and thus rendered
general business livelier, with more money in circulation
and collections good. The Atlantic seaboard is not re
flecting the cheerful conditions of the South and West
and reports general business quiet. It is the opinion that
the spring demand will open up later than expected a
short time ago, with the purchasing cautious and more
conservative. At the same time New York reports spring
buyers arriving in large numbers, most of them after cot
ton goods, though the further slump in the cotton market
will probably lead many of them to hold off a little longer
yet until the market becomes more settled.
The condition of Wall street remains practically un
changed. There is no excitement in the stock market
and the money market is still in fair condition, though,
as already mentioned, easy money is not expected to last
much longer. Secretary Shaw's proposed call on the
banks for $30,000,000 in Government deposits, largely for
Panama canal account, has caused considerable specula
tion as to the effect of this action on the market, but as
it has been alreadj' well discounted it is thought that the
banks will finance the withdrawal without much friction.
The public are still hanging back from stock speculation
and all the plungers have been paying too much attention
to the cotton market to operate in Wall street. The
enormous speculation in cotton is illustrated by the great
gain of iov6 per cent in New Orleans' bank clearings
last week, while the clearings themselves ran up to %$$,
954,000, leading those of half a dozen larger and much
1 more important cities. The clearings for the whole coun
try showed a loss of 9.9- per cent from the same week in
iqo.5, while New York, in spite of the wild speculation in
cotton and coffee, lost 154 per cent.
The rain was the distinctive feature of the week in
California. It came just in time to save the southern
pastures and crops, for the present at least, and although
the northern half of the State did not actually need it it
j was wclcome'all the same. With the usual spring show
ers good crops are promised for this year, and if Russia
and Japan go to war trade throughout the State will
probably receive a great stimulus. At present the out
look in California is decidedly bullish.
THE BLESSING OF THE RAIN.
â¢^ -^r j HILE the rains of the season have not been
\/\ / by any means as abundant as we need the recent
* " showers have had the effect of clearing away the
forebodings of a prolonged drouth and of giving. promise
of a spring that will bring us rain enough to assure good
harvests in orchard, vineyard, field and pasture in well
nigh every part "of the State. The consequence is that
the minds of men have been brightened as much as the
parched land has been refreshed. The influence of the
rain is indeed as manifest in the city as in the country,
and the good 'effects of it could be seen in the very faces
of men of business as they watched the pouring rain and
estimated what it would be worth to the'State in the way
of crops and commerce.
With the new feeling of cheerfulness resulting from the
rain there should be also a new earnestness in the resolve
to protect ourselves hereafter as far as possible from
evils resulting from a waste of the waters the showers
bring. It has now become a twice told story that for the
conservation of water it is necessary to protect the for
ests, but up to this time hardly anything- in the way of
genuine value has been done to guard ourAvoodlands from
destruction. Of course nothing in the way of a compre
hensive system of protection can be enacted and enforced
until there is a resolute public sentiment to support it.
That sentiment ought to have formed itself long since.
Our people are intelligent enough to fully understand the
importance of forests, but as yet they lack the art or the
"habit of acting as a united people, demanding the enforce
ment of laws which intelligence recognizes as essential
to the public good.
The only thing to be done in the matter is for those
who are interested in the work to keep incessantly
preaching it. In the end the controlling elements of our
people will be aroused to the need of taking action. Cali
fornia, is not exactly subject to drouth, but many sections
of the_ ! State are always liable to it, so that whenever there
is a long lack of rain a period of anxiety follows, and
there is a sort of lagging in business and in enterprise by
reason of the fear of shor* crops for the coming season.
Science, cannot as yet set in motion forces in the at
mosphere that will precipitate rain, but science can guard
against the waste of flood waters when they come and
can make best use of all that nature gives. The
topography of California is such that it'would be no very
difficult feat to conserve the rainfall so that hardly a
gajlon of it would flow at any season unused to the sea;
apd it is full time public attention was earnestly directed
to that end, not as a matter of academic discussion, but
as one of practical statecraft *of the first magnitude.
The .recent desperate and cowardly act of Yaqui In
dians, who murdered and robbed every passenger on a
Mexican stage coach, ought to shed an illuminating
thought on the maudlin opinions of those^that see only
outrage and oppression in governmental regulations
for the control of the redskins. Another incident of
experience has simply been recorded to demonstrate that
the only good Indian is a dead one.
DR. SHAW'S ADDRESSES.
SAN FRANCISCO may be weir congratulated upon
the visit of Dr. Albert Shaw and upon the addres-ses
he has delivered at the University of California and
at the banquet- tendered him by citizens of San Fran
cisco at the Palace Hotel on Saturday evening. On each
occasion he furnished a new inspiration to help us toward
the attainment of a higher business and municipal life, and
the memory of each will long remain as a cheering influ
ence both in the university and in the city.
From an academic standpoint the chief feature of his
visit is the address delivered at Berkeley. That was in
the highest sense of the word an oration. It had been
carefully prepared for an occasion of great dignity â the
opening of a new series of lectures on an important sub
ject before an academic audience. It was designed to
give the tone for all future lectures of the course and was
of a character to excite the emulation of whatever
scholar, publicist or man of business who may hereafter
be called upon to follow it. Recognizing all the high
qualities of that prepared oration, however, it is quite
probable that in respect to the influence exerted upon
the audience the casual and unprepared address on mu
nicipal administration delivered at the Palace banquet
surpassed it. v
It is to be regretted in some measure that the audience
which heard the later address was not larger. Good in
deed would it have been if all San Francisco could have
heard it, and yet it is doubtful if such a talk could have
been made to a large gathering. In its nature it was es
sentially a confidential, cheerful, discursive talk of a man,
master of a great subject, to a sympathetic group of
friends, every one of whom listened with a mind already
prepared to understand every allusion of the speech, and
to catch not merely the patent meaning, but the inner
suggestions of the words. It occupied upward of two
hours in delivery and there was not a dull minute from
first to last, not an instant when the attention of the
listener wearied or wandered; all were loth to have him
close.
The success of the talk was due to the fact that the
speaker, speaking with the prestige of a first-class author
ity on the subject, was talking to men who were as ardent
as himself in the cause of good municipal administration
and was saying to them just what they wished him to say
and in just the way they wished him to say it. It was in
effect a story of how modern municipal government has
grown up out of a desire in the hearts of men and women
of light and leading to 'improve the conditions of great
cities and render them healthful and beautiful places of
residence for the poorest as well as for the rich. It told
how the earliest efforts toward establishing sanitary reg
ulations lead by degrees to wider and greater efforts for
the general welfare; noted the successes that have been
achieved both in Europe and in America in that respect,
and detailed through the experience of New York how
the efforts for improvement under seemingly the most
adverse conditions can be successfully carried out if only
the right men grapple the problem with a resolute deter
mination to succeed.
The best encouragement for all future efforts at mu
nicipal betterment lies in the simple story of how much
has been already achieved. The arduous results of past
work stand as a prophecy of what will be accomplished
by the work of the future. In that regard Dr. Shaw's
talk was a genuine inspiration to every earnest man who
heard him, and we may be sure the effect will be felt in
the city for a long time. Our business men, who have
already done much in the way of aiding municipal im
provement, will resume their efforts in that direction
with renewed hope and energy by reason of the influence
this talk of an earnest master worker in the same lines
of endeavor has had upon them. It is therefore to be
repeated that San FYancisco is to be congratulated upon
Dr. Shaw's visit and it is to be hoped the visit also will
be repeated soon and frequently.
Not to.be outdone by her neighbor/Colorado, Utah
has discovered, great deposits of radium in the ores
that enrich the State. The only excitement yet apparent
in "connection with the discovery is the interest of the
rest of us to see how far men imay go in their exhibi
tions of enthusiasm over imaginary wealth found no
where else but in their inflamed desires. Radium is as
hard to find as it is valuable.
The vigilant officials of Salt Lake have captured a
youth who is inspired by a mania for wrecking trains.
Perhaps if the young man were properly persuaded that
the railroad people need no outside assistance in this par
ticular branch of American activity, in which they shine,
he might be restored to his sense's.
TALK OF THE TOWN
AND TOPICS OF THE
TIMES...
Blessed Memory.
The news had come in almost too late
for the papers to get it in. Just a head
clear across the page and the an
nouncement that King Alexander and
Queen Draga had been murdered by
regicidesâ that was all. But when the
staff came back to the office that aft
ernoon there was plenty to be done on
the 'local end" of the story.
"Get out around the town and dig
up a picture of Karageorgevitch, the
new King over there," said the news
editor. "Nobody ever heard of him be
fore; there is no Servian consulate
here; you may have a hard time land
ing that picture, but we must have it."
The new reporter left the august
presence with a long face. To get out
In San Francisco and find the picture
of some obscure little adventurer who
lived somewhere on the other side of
the globeâ he plainly saw his neck
trembling under the ax.
Every "ovitch" and "ovskV" in the
directory was frantically run to earth
by the terrified reporter, but no Kara
georgevitch came to gladden his heart.
From saloons out in Richmond to flsh
shops down near East street he wended
his weary way to seek the priceless
treasure from the Slavs; no picture of
the new King was forthcoming.
The young reporter was just begin
ning to think that a newspaper life
was not for him when suddenly a
thought struck him. That night when
he was "busted" and had gone to "The
Cold Day Chophouse" for his frugal
meal. Remember that picture over the
cash register with all the fly specks â
that picture which made him wonder If
it was intended to be that of the King
of Italy? Remember how he had tried
to spell that remarkable narae f while
he was eating his "ham and?" Re
member how the genial proprietor had
said that the picture was that of the
George Washington of Servla?
Well, the next morning The Toma
hawk had the only picture of Kara
georgevitch and the young reporter is
still a reporter.
Interested.
When he walked into the Emer
gency and requested permis
sion to look through the place the
steward readily gave him permission.
Ha accepted the steward's offer to
show him about with profuse thanks
and an offer of a cigar that looked
good to the white coated attache. In
the tour that followed the stranger
made a great display of interest, sur
prising the steward at times by the
manner in which he peered into every
corner and gazed along the walls.
He paid particular attention to the
cells in the insane department, spend
ing at least five minutes peeking
through the wickets in the doors*.
During the entire inspection he said
not a word, allowing the. steward to
explain the workings of the institu
tion without any comment.
The last room visited was the oper
ating room. Here the stranger took
a seat and remained for at least ten
minutes, gazing at the walls. Finally
he arose and offered his hand to the
steward, saying as he did so, "I thank
you, sir. You have a remarkably fine
collection."
â¢ "What's that?" asked the steward,
scenting trouble and stepping between
the visitor and the door.
"I never saw so many fine speci
mens of stuffed birds in all my life."
said the stranger.
â¢*Is that so," replied the steward.
"Just come in here and see this stuff
ed owl." And he led his visitor into
that part of the hospital sacred to the
"D. T." patients.
The Voice of Japan.

We bow to Geisha girls no lonser:
The cherry blossoms bloom in vain.
Speed on the breaking, crashing thunder,
We chafe to meet the iron rain!
Give us. then, some sure to-morrow â
We care not what the day may bring.
Just to fling our legions forward.
Just to hear the soldiers sing.
Oh! Mighty God of Bloody Battle.

Telegraphing in Chinese.
â¢ The explanation â¢ of Viscount Hay
ashl's remarks as to the difficulty of
telegraphing a message in Chinese -with
accuracy will be understood by any
one who realizes that in that language
there is a separate character for each
word. The method employed, which
was, we believe, the invention of a
Dane, is to group the characters as
far as it is possible to do so. and then
to "attach numbers to them. It is these
numbers which are telegraphed, and it
will easily be seen that under such a
systemâ the best which the peculiar
character of the Chinese language al
lowsâthe possibilities of error are
numerous. Our own Government cipher
messages are always in numbers; but
then the transmitter has not to Identify
a character, which often has very little
to distinguish it from half a dozen oth
ers, before he begins his message.
Roosevelt's Tenderness.
Here is a new story of the President,
told by Jacob A. Riis in his "Theo
dore Roosevelt, the Citizen." now run
ning serially in The Outlook:
"There was news of fighting every
day, but only the names of the killed
or wounded officers came by cable.
There was a War Department order
against sending those of tfie privates
who fell or who died of cholera; and
it resulted that when, say. Company H
of the Fifteenth Regiment had been
in battle, every mother who had a boy
serving in that command went shiver
ing with fear for six long weeks be
fore the mails brought word whether
her boy was among the 'thirteen pri
vate soldiers' who fell or not. I had
been asked to put the case to the Presi
dent and get him to cut the red tape,
if possible; but. against expectation. I
found a tableful of soldiers and states
men at lunch, and I saw clearly enough
that it would be hard to get the Presi
dent's ear long enough.
"But, as luck would have it, I was
put beside General Young, fine old war
rior, whom I had met before, and I
told him of what was on my heart.
He knew of no such order when ha
was in the Philippines, and we got into
quite a little argument about it. which
I purposely dragged. out till there was
a lull in the talk at the President's
end of the table, and I saw him look
ing my way. I asked him if he knew of
the order.
" 'What onder?" said he: and I told
himâ told him at the mothers fretting
for the boys all over the land. He
looked up quickly at Adjutant General
Corbin. who sat right opposite. It was
what I wanted. He knew.
." 'General.' said Mr. Roosevelt, *is
there such an order?"
V Tes, Mr. President," said he, 'there
is/ .
" 'Why?' President Roosevelt wastes
few words when he is in earnest about
anything.
"General Corbin explained that It was
a measure of economy. The telegraph
tolls were heavy. An officer had a code
word. Just one, to pay for, whereas to
send the whole name and place of a
private soldier under the Pacific Ocean
might easily exist perhaps $25. The
President heard him out.
" 'Corbin,' he said, 'can you telegraph
from here to the Philippines?'
"The general thought he might wait
till he got to Washington; he was go
ing in an hour.
" 'No,' said the President; 'no. we will
not wait. Send the order to have the
names telegraphed now. Those moth
ers gave the best they had to their
country. We will not have them break
ing their hearts for twecty-flve dollars
or for fifty. Save the money some
where else.' ** -

WASHINGTON*. Feb. 7.â That William
Jennings Brvan has pledged his influ
tnce and support to the William R.
Hearst boom has been repeated by its
friends and its enemies. That he has
actually promised whatever followipg
he may have in the St. Louis conven
tion to work for Hearst as Democratic
f-andidate for President was positively
Ftated to-day by a man who has been
familiar with the details of the Hearst
boom since it started. The opponents
of Hearst and Bryan have now accept
ed this as absolutely true and are
uniting' apainst the combination.
It also was stated to-day that within
a week an important conference was
held in New York by representatives
of what is now called the conservative
Democracy and an account of stork
was taken. Reports were made from
various parts of the country, where ob
servations of the various booms had
hff-n taken. The conservatives found
that Hearst was the only one of all the
candidates mentioned who had an act
ual organization at work in his inter
ests in various parts of the country.
Another result of this conference was
the sending of a note of alarm to trust
ed friends of all other men in the field.
It is said that while in the early stages
of the game It was thought best to al
low the Hearst boom to wear itself out
in itF own way. it must now be met
and fought as .a hostile menace to
Democracy and to the country. '
It was not the intention for friends
of Hearst and Bryan to have it become
known that thus early an actual prom
ise of the Nebraskan's support had
been made, and it is said to have been
tfw intention to have this develop
gradually and appear to have been
compelled by the growing strength of
Hearst in the West and among the
various elements which nominated
liryan and supported him in his cam
laijcna. The best element of the Dem
ocracy, however, does not regret that
the revelations of the compact have
been made, because it now sees and
does not hesitate to eay that it will be
â¢ rK-cf-Ksary to combat the combination
and that a beginning cannot be made
too soon.
The cable companies have notified their
c-uctomers that no messages addressed to

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 8. 1904.
FORMALLY DEDICATE CHURCH
TO ITS HALLOWED PURPOSES
Edifice of Calvary Presbyterian Congregation Is
the Scene^of Impressive Ceremony in Which
the Clergy of Many Denominations Take" Part
l % The dedication service of Calvary
J Presbyterian Church was held yester
j day afternoon in the magnificent edifice
i of the congregation, at Fillmore and
Jackson streets, in the presence of a
large gathering. The clergy of many
denominations were represented at the
service, in which a number of leading
| divines took part and which was Im-,
pressive.
Under the direction of Organist R. D.
Durness a special musical programme
was rendered by an augmented choir,
which included Mrs. Cecil Mark, Miss
Gertrude Wheeler, Frank Onslow and
Alexander Mennie.
The dedication service opened with
an organ prelude and- was followed by
the recital of the Doxology. Rev. W.
K. Guthrie delivered the invocation and
recited the Lord's Prayer, and the re
sponsive reading was given by Rev.
Edgar P. Hill. Rev. H. H. Bell led in
singing Hymn 304, and a selection of
Solomon's Prayer was read by Rev.
William Rader, the Congregational
minister. Rev. F. W. Clamptjtt, rector
of Trinity Episcopal Church, recited
the Apostles' Creed, after which Hymn
i 676 was sung by the congregation, led
by Rev. George G. Eldredge.
For the offertory the choir rendered
the hymn "Except the Lord Build the
House," and the dedicatory sermon was
then delivered by Rev. John Hemphill,
rector of Calvary Presbyterian Church.
SERMON' BY PASTOR.
In addressing the congregation the
pastor of the new house of worship in
part said:
In the fourth chapter of John, twenty-first
verse, we find the words: "Jesus saith unto
the woman, believe me,. the hour cometh when
ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at
Jerusalem, worship the Father."
The Hebrews worshiped God in tabernacles
and temples, but the Lord lifted the worship
out of local surroundings and made it univer
sal. Abraham built an altar on Mount Moriah
to the glory of God, and Isaac and Jacob
also erected altars to God. Jacob erected an
altar at Bethel and he said, "This ie the house
of the Lord."
Mcsen heard the voice saying to him, "Put
off thy ehoes, for the place where thou stand
eth is holy," and ho realized the presence of
the Lord.
In the erection of Solomon's Temple a whole
nation poured forth its wealth to build 'the
house or the Lord. Monarchs taxed their sub
jects and all rendered tribute to help in build-
Ing the house of worship.
The temple was built in silence, because God
was to dwell there. There* was no sound of
ax or hammer, for the temple was to be a
glorious structure, not In Its dome and pin
nacles nor Its pillars of cedar nor Its f urni- I
ture and fine fittings and gold altars, but in
the ureat presence due to the Lord's way. The
glory of thfe Lord filled the house of God and
we read that the priests could not remain in
the temple when the sacred cloud hovered
over the building.
What a vast difference there Is in the mes-
S8ge that Christ, gave to the woman at the
well. "Ye shall neither In this mountain, nor
yet at Jerusalem, wcrehip the Father."
ITS PURPOSE IS GLORIOUS.
We are not sure of the Identity of any of
the places connected with Christ and most of
the places pointed out by guides are false.
This house of worship has ,no glory In
itself. It Is Its purpose that renders It glori
ous. Our churches might be the .most beauti
ful on earth, yet be as Solomon's Temple was
without the presence of the Lord. It Is the
presence of Christ that gives glory to all and
makes .worshipers Independent of all agencies.
A church without Christ Is like a lamp with
out wick or oil. The church must have the
presence of Christ to represent truth and love,
so that it may warm and invigorate living
Christianity. Christ must be In the head and
heart of all true Christians In order to think
and live. Christ is the glory of the church. - I
I believe in the dedication of churches and
in consecrations of churches, and I also be
lieve in the consecration of every stone in the
church, not the stone hewn by the hand of
man, but those hewn by God. The hearta
shaped into the likeness of Christ; that Is
the consecration I believe In.
We have here to-day ministers of many
Christian denominations taking part In this
service, for we love all that love Christ and
we recognize them as regiments in the army
of the Lord.
We have no right to draw a. little circle
and say we represent the King in Heaven.
The only circle we have the right to draw is
one of boundless diameter, one which consti
tutes God's own love.
CHILDREN OP ONE FATHER. .
That circle Is far reaching and cannot bÂ«
measured even as Jesus said to the woman at
the well. "Ye shall neither' In this mountain,
| nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father."
Whether you worship God here or in Jerusa
lem, If you worship God in spirit and truth,
we recognize you and love you as children of
the common Father.
I believe in making a bouse of worship beau- '
tiful and to blazon its windows with gold
and crimson, for it iÂ« the purposa of thÂ« I
church that gives its glory, for Christ has
made it so.
It was the word of Christ to the woman at
the well that made the spot a holy one, and
of all places where God is worshiped we
prizÂ« this building, but we depend on It for
nothing for the essential portion of our church.
We existed before we had a building. It is
â¢ not the building that consecrates the worship
held in It. but it is the worship that conse
crates, the building.
We dedicate this church to the worship of
; God and to elevate that worship there muat
be no divorce between the worship and the
work of men. The man that worships in thÂ«
sa::ctuary and then goes to his business or
home and does not follow out the teachings
of Christ in. his dally work is a scoundrel and
a sample of pagan. . .
God cannot be confined to temples made by
the hand of man. If a man Is truly a ser
vant of God, then all his life belongs to the
Lord, no matter where he may be.
Let ihls ever be the house of prayer, of
adoration and thanksgiving to God, to teach
all to carry God's teachings into all walks of
life. .
We thank God for the history of this church,'
which enables us to celebrate its lubllee. Let
us so do our work that the day will, come when
all churches will be merged and that the tem
ple of the Lord be in the whole world where
he shall.be crowned Lord of All.
BISHOP GIVES BENEDICTION.
Following the sermon, the prayer of
dedication, was delivered by the Rev.
J. S. Macintosh, followed by the sing
ing of hymn No. 139, led by the Rev.
J. George Gibson, the Baptist minister.
Bishop J. W. Hamilton of the Meth
odist Episcopal Church pronounced the
benediction and the services concluded
with an organ postlude.
Although the dedication service of
Calvary Presbyterian Church was- held
yesterday, the sacred edifice has been
used for worship for nearly a year.
The congregation of Calvary Church
first erected its ' house of worship on
Bush street, between Montgomery
and Sansome, the building being
dedicated on February 14, 1855. From
the first location, the congregation
moved to the corner of Powell and.
Geary streets, the church at that spot
being dedicated on May 16, 1869. . The
site where the first church of the Cal
vary congregation stood on Bush street
is now occupied by the general offices
of the telephone company, while its
second location, on Geary and Powell
streets, was secured for the new Hotel
St. Francis.
OFFICERS OF THE CHURCH. N
The officers of the church are:
Board of trustees â H.~ T. CreBwell. president;
James Hogg, vice president; A. K. Durbroji",
treasurer; Benjamin Romaine, secretary; A. J.

At Hamilton Methodist Episcopal
Church, Belvedere and Waller streets.
a thanksgiving: service was held yester
day.
Eight months ago the present tem
porary structure was erected. Since
that time the congregation has in
creased to such proportions and the
outlook has become so bright for the
church that the congregation deter
mined upon the service of thanksgiving.
Bishop Ha'miUon. who attended the
opening services in the church, was
present yesterday and took part in the
praise services. Both in the morning
and afternoon the edifice was crowded.
The morning service was one of song,
and a sermon was delivered by Bishop
Hamilton, who spoke of the Christian
achievements of the present century.
He told of the great aim of the gospel
to secure the sodality of the race
which sin had divided and ' depressed.
The first great achievement, said the !
Bishop, was the missionary movement,
! the second was {he emancipation of the
slave race, the third the manumission
: of other oppressed classes artd fourth
! the brotherhood of all peoples and per
| sons.
"The rapidly increasing growth of the
Christian church," said Bishop Hamil
ton, "was seen not alone in enlightened
nations, but among all pagan peoples
since the missionary movement began.
During the last three-quarters of a cen
tury there have been more than 1,000,000
converts to the Christian faith in pagan
lands, which is equivalent to the
achievement of the first five Christian
centuries."
It was a/nounced that the church
building is free of debt and that there
is only $2000 to be paid on the land.
During the morning a voluntary offer
ing was. made amounting to $1500.
At the afternoon service members
from various choirs augmented the
Hamilton Church choir, and among
those that took part in the service be
sides Bishop Hamilton were the Rev.
G. W. White, D. D., presiding elder;
Dr. Matthews, the Rev. Mr. Keast and
the Rev. C. O. Oxnam, the pastor.
SPECIAL MUSIC AT TRINITY.
Monthly Programme Is Rendered by
Specially Reinforced Choir.
The regular monthly musical ser
vice at Trinity Episcopal Church at
tracted a large ' assemblage of wor
shipers to . the sacred edifice last
night. The programme was one of
the best that has been rendered at
the church for many months. The
choir was specially reinforced for the
occasion and was under the able di
rection of Louis E. Eaton.
Rev. Dr. Clampett, the pastor, de
livered a short sermon during the in
termission. Dr. Clampett took for his
text, "Divine Inspirations." ., During
the course of his remarks he took oc
casion to refer to the work of the
great masters in poetry, fiction, art
and science and said that in his opin
ion the geniuses of every age were
inspired divinely and that some of.
their works or sayings upheld this
theme. He dwelt upon the work of
Shakespeare and Dante, particularly,
and quoted these two as examples of
divine inspiration. Following is the
musical programme rendered by the
choir: â¢
Processional, hymn 5O5(Parker); Apostles' Creed;
collections: "Gallia" (Gounod), soprano solo and
chorus Miss Flynn and choir; "Holiest,
Breathe and Evening Blessing" (Martin), cho-'
rus; 'Tears of Sorrow, Shame and Anguish."

COLBURN TELLS OF ADVANTAGES THAT
EXHIBIT WILL GIVE SAN FRANCISCO
ILLUSTRATIVE SCENES IN SANTA ROSA, AND ALSO IN SHASTA
COUNTY. IN WHICH SUGGESTIONS Of UTILITY AND OF SCENIC
v BEAUTY ARE UNITED.
City Is Rich in Show Materials That
Will Advertise.
By Frederick II. Colburn. Secretary San Francisco's Exposition Committee.
All California is engaged in making
iti resources and its climatic and other
advantages known to the world as
much as possible. Civic pride has'
something to do with this. We are all
proud of California, of course. The de
sire to promote the growth of our State
in material prosperity actuates 'us
strongly. We are not averse to having
the world know what conditions attend
us daily. We wish to have those -who
would be an advantage to California
come to dwell with us.
This is the desire of the interior
towns and cities and of the people of
all â  sections of the State. San Fran
risco is as much interested in having
its beauties and advantages talked
about by the world at large as is any
hamlet in California. Hence it/ is that
San Francisco citizens of public spirit,
appreciative of the opportunity that is
afforded for publicity at a world's fair,
have taken the preliminary steps to
have a fitting show in behalf of and
representative of San Francisco. In so
far as is possible, at St. Louis' great
exposition.
The question is naturally asked as to
what San Francisco has to exhibit and
how it is purposed to show what we
have. That is a. plain question and de
serves a plain answer, which I have
been requested to make through the
columns of The Call. No one In Cali
fornia could well imagine California
as complete with San Francisco left
out. It is the metropolis of California,
the moneyed center, the seat .of the
greatest manufacturing industries. The
great commercial port of the -State is
here. The great rivers of the northern
and central counties are tributary to
the Bay of San Francisqo. This city is
destined to be to the Pacific coast what
New Tork is to the Atlantic coast â at
once a propelling financial and indus
trial power and a beneficiary from the
vast and fruitful country which has
been linked with its destiny by- nature.
San Francisco has the greatest* popu
lation.of any city west of the Missouri
River. With the primacy In manu
facturing, in population, in capital in
vested and in banks, in .number of
school children and educational advan
tages; as the center of musical interest
and culture for the Pacific coast; with
more libraries, more miles of water
front tributary to It, facing the Orient
and being the chief point of departure
by sea for all Pacific Ocean countries
and islands â these are some of the fac
tors that enter into the provision of
â worthy and interestingly numerous ex
hibits to Justify an appearance at St.
Louis in competition with other great
American municipalities.
INT>USTIUAIÂ« EXHIBITS.
In a way, these suggestions indicate
something of the scope of what San
Francisco has to exhibit. There are
many details that must necessarily be
overlooked in an article of the pre
scribed length on this theme. We have
the products of mills, factories, shops
and of a countless great variety of in
dustrial enterprises due to San Fran
cisco capital and existing in San -Fran
cisco that are worth showing.
Many of the products are unique.
Among these may be classed mining
machinery and appliances, which are
tvorld-famous. We have a vast array
of vessels of all descriptions at our
wharves, from the Email river boat of
peculiar construction to the ponderous
carrier of huge bulks of freight; trans
port ships that carry men and supplies
for the American army to and fro
across the Pacific: vessels that move
alarge share of the wheat crop of the
gtate T annually around Cape Horn on
its way to foreign ports; trim and
splendid steamships that constitute
lines connecting San Francisco with
China, Japan, Central America, Ha
waii, Tahiti, Australia, New Zealand â
all countries that face any ocean or
sea.
San Francisco js the hilliest city in
America. Its scenery is on a large
scale. With great hills that are legion
in number, it also has correspondingly
deep valleys. Its outlook in one direc
tion is on the vast width of the Pacific
Ocean. In the other. direction it faces
the great panorama on the east that
begins with the encircling waters of
the bay of San Francisco and continues
until a far horizon is mountain rimmed.
The great diversity of elevation in
San Francisco provides much that is
unique and quite wonderful in local
scenery.
When we show what we can manu
facture, what facilities we have for
commerce and what the vast accesso
ries are that stimulate that commerce,
and when/additionally, we exhibit our
native city by the Golden Gate for Its
own sake and upon its own merits,
then it will be seen, if we ~o no further,
that we are justified in thinking that
we have much that will attract the at
tention of the tourist, the man of busi
ness and. Indeed, of all classes of citi
zens of the world who have the means
and the desire to travel.
ADVERTISING THE CITY.
To have the world Bee what San
Francisco has to offer is the first aim
of the committee now promoting the
San Francisco exhibition to be made
at St. Louis. That Is the primary step
to induce people to come to San Fran
cisco. When they arrive, it will be the
duty of the people of the city to in
duce them to cast their lot in with us.
But there is much more to be ex
hibited than that which has already
been outlined. There are art galleries,
the interiors of libraries, the school life,
the bustling daily business of a multi
tude of streets, the operation of great
ferry and street car systems;
the park pystem that has its
culmination in the glories of Golden
Gate Park, the numerous picturesque
localities like the ocean beach, the
heights that look down on the lower
portions of the city, the Presidio' and
other places that' are known to Cali
fornians as being worthy to be shown
for the instruction and admiration of
the world. .:*.' Â«â .
San Francisco includes in its school
system institutions for technical train-
Ing that are noteworthy. The Affiliated
Colleges that are a part of the Uni
versity of California are here. Pho
tography as exemplified in moving pic
tures ' in the panoramas will be util
ized to the best possible advantage to
present all the features of institutions
and the life of San Francisco to ob
servers.
The ChriBtmas markets, the teeming
wharves in the fruit seasonâ these and
the great demonstrations that period
ically take place on Van Ness avenue,
such as the reception to President
Roosevelt, possess the interesting ele
ment of being unique. , v v
What San Francisco has municipally
in buildings and institutions, the de
partments of the public service, police
and fire departments, must be included,
and willibe. There are means to put
the facts concerning the San Francisco
climate in evidence before the /world
that will be fully utilized. /
Illustrated lectures with moving pic
tures will give vivid impressions of San
Francisco. The city has many fine
buildings to illustrate its architecture.
These facts indicate only in outline the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 8, 1904.
County Progress
Is Strongly
Marked.
The newspapers of the Interior cities
of California are doing their best to
have the facts known concerning the
localities wherein they are published.
These publications make up a compen
dium of local information of unques
tioned value that could hardly be other
wise arrived at. Sonoma County is the
general theme of the Santa Rosa Press
Democrat in a recent Issue, but much
space is also devoted especially to San
ta Rosa. Among the more striking
statements made is one about trans
portation: "Twenty trains arrive at
and depart from Santa Rosa every day,
connecting the city with all parts of
the county, the interior of the State,
San Francisco, Sacramento; the over
land trains for the East, Oregon, the
sound cities and British Columbia."
The claim is made also that "Santa
Rosa is the natural capital of the
northwest coast and the railway cen
ter for a large territory." Concerning
the growth of Santa Rosa it is said:
When the first railroad reached Santa Rosa
in 1871 the place had fewer than 1000 Inhabit
ants, which increased in the next few years to
3000. since which time it has had a rapid
growth. It is now surrounded by many email,

hops and large quantities of fresh, dried and
canned fruits, vegetables, grapes and wine are
fold annually in Santa Rosa. There is a rap-
Idly increasing industry in growing vegetables
for canning, especially asparagus, tomatoes and
string beans, all of which are profitable crops.
The yield of tomatoes per ton is astonishing;
they thrive beyond all precedent in this at
mosphere.
NUMEROUS ATTRACTIONS.
Santa Rosa is justly pictured as a
city strong In fraternal and social so
cieties; provided with excellent educa
tional advantages and with numerous
churches; a well equipped and efficient
paid Fire Department; with excellent
social conditions. In the schools are
enrolled about 2000 pupils, who are
taught by thirty-three teachers. The
new high school building cost $30,000.
The school is accredited by the Univer
sity of California. There are manufac
turing establishments in Santa Rosa
that are doing well. The climate is il
lustrated by the floral products of the
city, which are alluded to as follows:
Santa Rosa, "the City of Roses," has long
been noted for its gardens. of rare ornamental
trees and flowers. It Is the natural home of
roses, geraniums, lilies, chrysanthemums,
fuchsias and kindred growths. The latter plant

worthy of its patron. Saint Rose, and of the
magician of horticulture, Luther Burbank. In
almost no tlmÂ» a vacant lot tn Santa Rosa can

not all- of them. This is a great con
vention city. It has good hotels and is
about to have more, the newer ones be-'
ing constructed splendidly and having
accommodations calculated to maintain
the reputation of the city fully.
UNITED ACTION IS NEEDED. ,
As to the building in which San Fran
cisco will make its individual exhibition
much has been said. It will immediate
ly front the main entrance to the ex
position grounds at St. Louis and will
occupy a central and very advantage
ous position, where .it will be seen
from all parts of the grounds. That it
will become well known to .millions' of
visitors to St. Louis, and that it will
enhance the prosperity of this city,
there is no chance for doubt. It is not
necessary to here enter into a detailed
description of the building.
What San Francisco is w^ill not be
sufficient to show. What it will be by
the Judicious expenditure of the pro
ceeds of bonds that have been voted for
to the amount of $18,000,000, and what
it will be by reason of the work of pub
lic spirited citizens who have taken up
the work of beautifying and adorning
the Pacific Coast metropolis will be sus
ceptible of presentation to the specta
tors at St. Louis.
There is no interest that will not suf
fer by failure to make good at St.
Louis. Failure to take advantage of
this opening and to live up to its high
est privileges Is not to be thought of
for a moment. All that is needed for
most pronounced success is united ef
fort by the citizens of San Francisco
in backing up the very capable com
mittee having this â  work in hand. So
far, the outlook is sufficiently bright to
please the most exacting a,nd enthusi
astic advocate of a greater' San Fran-

Are Held by the San Francis

EXERCISES IMPRESSIVE
Members of Order and Friends
Show Reverence to Memory of
Those Gone to Eternal Rest
Impressively solemn were the memo
rial services held in Native Sons' Hall
yesterday afternoon by the Fraternal
Order of Eagles, represented by the
members of San Francisco and Golden
Gate aeries. The services began at 2
p. m., but long before that hour tha
hall, which had been beautifully deco
rated for the occasion, was crowded to
the doors. In the assembly were many
representative men of the city and
some occupied the seats on the stage,
'conspicuously among the latter being
the members of the reception commit
tee, Harry I. Mulcrevy, Judges Hunt,
Troutt, Lawlor, Cook and Graham,
Superintendent of Public Schools
Langdon, Justice of the Peace Daniels.
David Becker and Albert Berthier, the
present and past grand officers of the
order, Rabbi Nieto and Rev. Father
Joseph T. McQuaide.
The exercises opened with an orches
tral rendition of Chopin's "Funeral
March," which was followed by an ad
dress by Harry I. Mulcrevy, who pre
sided over the gathering, and briefly
referred to the purposes of the occa
sion, the principles of the order and the
duties that ever bound the members
of the latter together in fraternalship.
A soprano solo, "Flee as a Bird," by
Miss Gertrude McDermott; preceded
an eloquent invocation delivered by
Rabbi J. Nieto, and the Masonic Male
Quartet then sang "Lead, Kindly
.Light," and this was followed by a
cornet solo, "Lost Chord," by J. H.
Bromberger. â¢
An address which was to have been
delivered by Mayor Schmitz, who was
unable to attend the exercises, was
supplemented by one from John E. Mc-
Dougald, who paid a high tribute to
the order, reviewing its fraternal and
social features and its endearment for
the living and its respect for the de
parted. Frederick Everett's tenor solo,
"Calvary," proved a most inspiring of
fering and was a handsome prelude to
the eulogy of the dead, delivered by R.
P. Troy. The Masonic v Male Quartet
sang "Nearer, My God. to Thee," and
the afternoon's exercises were brought
to a close with a benediction by Rev.
Father Joseph T. McQuaide and
"America," rendered by the orchestra.

MINING IN SHASTA.
Shasta County is proud of its great
increase in mineral output. Hence the
Redding Free Press, which has pub
lished a special edition devoted to sthe
county of Shasta, says:
Since the new furnace at the Bully Hill
smelter has been blown in. Shasta County la
producing at least $800,000 a month in metallic
wealth. The output of 1002 and 1903 was ma
terially reduced by the strike, which began in
October, 1002, and which prevented full re
sumption until June, 1903, but this unfortunate
condition no longer exists, and the present year
promises to reach the Â«10, 000,000 mark In our
output. Shasta County leads the next best
county in the State by 300 per cent in the
value of its metal output, and the present rate
Of monthly production Is 1000 per cent in ad
vance of the monthly production of 1806.
This remarkable showing is due mainly to
the magnificent development on the base ore
belt, but the quartz districts of Shasta
County are attracting wider attention than
ever partly because of the sillcious ore mar
ket supplied by the smelters, and partly be
cause of the advantages In metallurgical and
mechanical processes, which makes these ores
reducible on the ground. Harrison Gulch and
French Gulch are continuous and profitable
producing districts of this character. Some
shipments of ores are made from the latter
district, but the greater portion of the output
is treated on the ground. In the Old Diggings
district the most extensive shippers of the
county are located, mainly because of the close
proximity of the mines to the big Keswick
smelter. . ,
RESOURCES ARE VARIED.
The Free Press makes a good show
ing for Shasta County and its com
munities in several ways. It says that
219,000,000 fish eggs have been shipped
from Shasta from the Government fish
eries. In addition to the mining in
dustries the stock raising and lumber
ing industries are good sources of
wealth. There is a great water power
in the county. As to the vegetation it
is said:
Fruit raising I* carried on extensively, and
the yearly output of green fruit aggregates
several hundred carloads, much of which is
shipped to the Eastern market. The famous
Happy Valley section is prolific in the pro
duction of fruits of all kinds. Peaches, pears,
apricots, plums, prunes and all varieties of
berries rinen tlie earliest there, and are or
quality unexcelled. The Anderson Valley,
Churn Creek bottom and the mountainous sec
tions In Eastern Shasta are all prolific pro
ducers of fruit and berries.
Ofanges, lemons and bananas grow and
thrive in Shasta, and palms, maznollas and
other tropical plants appear to be In their
natural element here.
The water power in the county Is unsur
passed. Here Is supplied the power that gen
erates all, the electricity that Is used In Red
ding and 'surrounding towns, and In all of. the
towns of the Sacramento Valley as far south
as Willows. â
Shasta County has good schools and
many churches. Redding now has a
population of more than 3500. The place
contains four hotels. The third rank
In freight shipments in the State has
been won. The assessed value of, the
county is $10,888,000, while Redding is
assessed for $1,635,000. y- :-^ ;

business houses and residences aggregating
$200,000. A Carnegie library, Just completed.

NAVY PERSONNEL ACT CAUSE
OF VEXATION IN THE SERVICE
Its Provisions for Pay of Officers Are Indefinite
and Lead to So, Many Cases of Appeals That
Moody Urges Congress to Revise the Law
The navy personnel act of March 3,
1899, has caused more vexations to the
service than tny other naval legis
lation since the navy was established
in 1798, and the end is not yet in sight.
The law regarding the pay is In many
cases so indefinite as to have led hun
dreds of cases of appeal to the Comp
troller of the Currency, and with such
results as to prove that the naval offi
cers are better lawyers than those
members of Congress who framed and
passed the law. The act of 1870, super
ceded by that of 1899, was clear and
explicit and every .officer knew what
ho was entitled to; now all is confusion
and the Comptroller himself has been
stumped several times, the latest in
stance being that of determining what
officers of the navy are entitled to
horses and consequent forage pay. The
Comptroller ruled that the surgeon gen
eral and the paymaster general are en
titled to such allowances, by which
reasoning, Secretary Moody contends,
the nine junior rear admirals would
be entitled to like allowance, but the
nine senior rear admirals would be de
nied it. By another decision, certain
members of the medical and pay corps
are entitled to mounted pay of the
army, giving them yearly increase
varying from one hundred to several
hundred dollars, upon the. theory that
they are entitled to the use of a horse.
The Secretary cites as- an instance,
showing the confusion in the system
of pay, that in one case in the Court
of Claims the pay of an officer was
changed eleven times and urges upon
Congress the necessity of reconsidera
tion of the whole subject of pay.
Secretary Moody has taken the wind
out of the sails of the Taylor-Evans
general "staff scheme by having the
present general board assume the func
tions of the general staff in a greatly
modified form. This general board con
sists of the admiral, three rear ad
mirals, three captains, three command
.ers, one lieutenant and one colonel of
marines.
CALIFORNIA'S STAR.
California has come to the front
again after a lapse of thirty-two years
in being represented at the Naval
Academy by a star member of the
graduating class in David McDougal
I.e Breton, a native of San Francisco.
In 1872 Nathaniel T. James, credited to
California, graduated with a star and
since then none of the midshipmen from
this State have appeared among the
exceptionally bright graduates who
must obtain 85 per cent of the possible
maximum marks to be classified as
"stars." Mr. Le Breton has the unus
ual distinction of having led in all
four of the classes through which he
has passed, and his aggregate credits
foot up to 5SS.12, out of a possible 624,
or 94.25^ per cent for the entire course.
This record has been excelled only by
David AV. Taylor, now a naval con
structor, whose percentage for four
yearn was 95.67. Other notable grad
uates were Lewis Nixon, with 91.31 per
cent; John G. Tawresey, superintend
ing naval constructor at the Union Iron
"Works, 91.18 per cent, and Francis T.
Bowles, who occupied the position of
chief constructor, and from which he
resigned last November, was credited
v.ith 87.23 per cent for his four years'
course at the Naval Academy.
UXLUCKY CONTRACTORS.
Sixteen torpedo-boat destroyers were
contracted for In 1898, to be completed
in February and May, 1900, and all of
these boats have, after much delay,
been delivered, the last two, named
Hopkins and jMacdonough, in May and
July of last /year, which, was thirty
seven and thirty-eight months behind
the contract time. Four of these ves
sels exceeded their speed requirements,
and the others tailed to come up to the
guaranteed speeds, but were accepted
and proved to be excellent seaboats and
valuable acquisitions to the navy. Of
the twelve torpedo-boats contracted for
at the same time, to be delivered in
September and November, 1899, five are
still uncompleted and ' the ill-fated
Goldsborough, contracted for in July,
1897, is no nearer completion now than
she was in October, 1900. The contracts
for these torpedo-boats were distribu
te! among ten firms, every one of which
have paid dearly for their experience
in that line, and claims are now before
Congress to reimburse the builders for
their losses.
The average contract price paid for
the destroyers was $281,000, and the
average cost to the contractor was
$375,000, showing an apparent loss to the
builder of $94,000, where his net profit
should have been about $28,000. . The
average contract price was $152,000 for
the torpedo-boats, but the builders
claim that the actual cost was $225,000,
a difference of $73,000: The total amount
asked for by the suffering contractors
is about $2,280,000, and Mr. Bonvles,
formerly chief constructor in the navy
and at present president of the Fore
River shipyard, has been selected by
the contractors to present their case to
Congress. The naval experience of Mr.
Bowles and his whilom connection with
the late t United States Shipbuilding
Company 'as an appraiser of the value
of ship plants and work will enable him
to present the case of the torpedo craft
contractors in an interesting if not a
convincing way to the committee of
Congress or before the Court of Claims.
NAVAL STORES ACCOUNTS.
The disclosures made by Paymaster
General Harris in relation to the ac
cumulated stores at the navy yards is
virtually a confession of incapacity of
the bureau of supplies and accounts and
an admission that the annual reports
of expenditures and stores on hand are
incorrect. At a recont hearing before
the House Naval Committee it was
brought out that no inventories had
been taken of these accumulated naval
stores, and the paymaster; general es
timated that it would take three years
to make such an Inventory. By an act
of Congress of June 30, 1890, naval sup
plies, with few exceptions, were placed
under the charge of the bureau of pro
visions and clothing, all articles being
purchased and cared for by the store
keepers at the several navy yards, from
which the other departments have since
obtained articles required. Inventories
were taken at all the shore stations and
an'"elaborate sysjtem of accounts was
started, by means of which, according
to Paymaster General Edwin Stewart's
report of October 15, 1891, "this bureau
is enabled to follow in minute detail all
expenditures of money and material so
as to be. able to give the value of all
property comprising the naval estab
lishment and the cost of maintaining
it, to say what each ship in the new
navy has cost and to give the running
expense of every vessel in commission."
The system of bookkeeping* has been
greatly simplified during the succeed
ing years, and each annual report has
given the ' value of stores on hand at
shore station's and on board ships.
The statement, however, that no In
ventory has been taken strongly in
dicates, that these reports are ficti
tious to a large extent and that the
system of bookkeeping is such as
would, not be practiced by any pri
vate establishment. There may be
no < crookedness, " but there is sure to
be a great waste under such a condi
tion of affairs and an investigation
would not be amiss. It does not seem
credible that when paymasters acting:
as storekeepers at -naval stations re
lieve their predecessors they would
sign receipts for stores for which they
became responsible and take the
chances of shortages by accepting the
entries on books as evidence that tha
articles are actually on hand.
PRIMITIVE MITTHODS.
Under the old system when each
department in the navy yards pur
chased the supplies needed the waste
and accumulation of stores was con
siderable, and led to abuses, extrava
gancies and corruption which culmin
ated under the Robeson regrime in
1S76. As far back as the early 60's
the system was extremely primitive
and no one thought of taking a book
entry seriously. Timber and lumber
of all descriptions were then as now
difficult to keep track of, and when
the books failed to reveal the where
abouts of any particular piece wanted
the timber clerk would dismiss the
subject with the remark that " if the
stick is not expended on the books It
must be in the mud." And, sure
enough, twenty years later large quan
tities of live oak were recovered from
the site where excavations were made
for the stone dry dock. Later on,
when shiploads of live oak and white
oak timber were accumulated for the
sole purpose of distributing money
among contractors and when this tim
ber and plank could not be utilized
for building and repair purposes, it
was converted nto fire wood, carted
to the officers' residences and burned,
and the entry of "condemned" was
made on the books. It was a simple
method of disposing of surplus ma
terial and had the merit of concisely
stating that it was no longer avail
able.

To-day fifteen hundred clever club
â women are packing their dress suit
cases â or those of their husbands â
with royal raiment preparatory to de
parting for the annual federation
eriithering at Sacramento. And what
â¼. ith receptions, caucuses, political
combinations, dissertations on topics
civic, domestic, philanthropic, cultur
nL legislative and reformatory, there
will be no time during the conven

Now who is there with soul so
dense as not to see from the foregoing
that club women are a pretty busy
people? And at the federation a 10
minute exposition of what they have
been bu^y about will be given by the
lanrer clubs.
You will observe that the delegates
will be amply welcomed â first by his
Excellency the Governor, then by his
Honor the Mayor and thence as fol
lows: Firstly, by Mrs. A. A. God
dard of the Sarramento Tuesday Club;
Becondlj". by Mis>- Bessie? Crouch of the
Ladies" Museum Association, and last
ly by Mrs. H. 'WV-inptock of the King
ston Art Club. Now could the most
diffident delegate doubt that Sacra
mento was really glad to meet her?
Now this triple welcome arranged by
the <lub members of Sacramento may
â or may not â have been a bit^of
clever diplomacy unon tho part of the
programme committee, for with clubs
r:s with nations, diplomacy is the pro
moter of peace â therefore of success.

On Thursday the vital issue of the

takes place â not only the election of
officers for the State Federation, but
also of de!egateÂ» to the great biennial

the United States will convene.
This convention will meet in the
Exposition city on May 17, and al

St. Louis, and its possession of the
Kreat World's Fair, it is thought that
the coming biennial will be the largest
convention of women's clubs yet held
in America.
Who's going? Well, one delegate â
the newly elected State president, pre
sumably Mrs. Darlingâ is sure to go as
delegate at large; then it will devolve
uj>on her to select two others of like
rank. Now, the Los Angeles district
fells that it is entitled to one of these,
while many of the San Francisco dis
trict delegates declare that, as the
president will presumably come from
the south (Mrs. Darling) that section
will be amply represented, and that the
other two delegates at large should
come from north of Tehachapi. This is
the only point of contention in the In
tricacies of the situation, as the other
six delegates will be named by their
six respective delegations at Sacra
mento.
Would Mr. Ruef, Mr. Kelly or any of
our other statesmen like to go up to
see the women do practical politics?
Apropos of the biennial at St. Louis,
It will last nine days, six of which will
be consumed in actual work, and the
three remaining days given over to
taking in the exposition and to social
life, of which there will be much.
On April 19 the Daughters of the
American Revolution will hold their
annual convention in Washington, to
which the chapters in this cfty will
send delegates, unless signs fall.
The National Council of Women was
in session at Indianapolis last week, to
which Mrs. John F. Swift, the State
president of the Council of Women of
California, went on as a representative.
This body of women in council as
sembled performed heroic work in the
line of resolutions, for note the range
of timely topics:
1. Hygienic and serviceable dress
for women. â¢
2. Abolition of laws that compel wo
men school teacHers to resign their po
sitions on marrying, claiming that such
a law is unconstitutional and prejudi
cial to public morals â likewise a gross
Injustice to school children.
3. The establishment of juvenile
courts in all States not now supporting
them.
4. The enforcement of the civil ser
vice reform movement
5. The establishment of schools for
domestic service, wherein housemaids,
nursemaids, etc., would receive intelli
gent trainingâ the schools to be placed
upon a business, rather than a philan
thropic basis. Good scheme, If it would
work.
On Mrs. Swift's return the incidents
of this vigorous session will be eagerly
heard in the local Women's Council.
The California Club will hold no
meeting, to-morrow, owing to the he
gira to Sacramento, but on the suc
ceeding Tuesdays will present its virile
programme:
Tuesday, February 16â Programme
in charge of the department of civics,
Mrs. K. L. Baldwin chairman. James
D. Phelan. subject. "The New Move
ment fc.T a Greater San Francisco";
Dr. Dorothea Moore, subject, "Some

Tuesday, February 23â Social day.
Programme in charge of Mrs. Louis
Hertz. "Social Life of the Ghetto" will
be presented by Otto Irving Wise;
cello solos. Paul Friedhofer, accompa
nist Mrs. David Hirschler.
The music section of the club, under
the able leadership of Mrs. Emilie To
jetti. gave^ a delightful afternoon last
Thursday, when a short talk â "short"
talks, by the way. are growing in pop
ularity in up-to-date clubs â on "The
Evolution of the Pianoforte and the
Modern Composers" was given by the
section leader. Mme. Tojetti then pre
sented Henri F. Salz. the pianist, who
illustrated the subject "Modern Piano
forte Literature" with a novelette by
Schumann'; Scherzo, by d'Albert; Valse
Impromptu. Liszt; Fantasie. op. 49, by
Chopin; Heimwarts. by Grieg, and
Polonaise, by Moszkowski. Mr. Salz
proved himself to be a piatiist of rare
powers, having complete command of
the instrument and a fine conception of
the various composers. He # was ap
plaudedâand for good reasonâ after
each number, and received an ovation
at the reception held after the pro
gramme. Mr. Salz graciously respond
ed by drinking a cup of club tea.
Through thp, agency of the depart
ment of education of the California
Club much progress along the lines of
appreciation of art values Is contem
plated through the purchase of 100 fine
reproductions of the world's master
pieces. These will be circulated in such
schools or clubs as will pay the postage
upon them and the nominal rental of a
dime â which pays for the accompany
ing catalogue conveying the necessary
information as to names, dates and
schools of art.

The Contemporary Club at its last
meeting discussed "The Religion of a

The Association of Collegiate Alum
nae held its regular monthly meeting on
Saturday. January 31. at Sorosis Hall.
After a merry luncheon the members
listened to addresses on "The Relation
of the Public Library to the Public
School in. California." Mrs. Frances
Bracken Gould read a masterly paper
embodying the results of the investiga
tion carried on during the last year Dy
a committee of the association. George
Clark, librarian of the S&n Francisco
Free Public Library, followed with an
interesting discussion of the relation
between the ' library and the school,
from the point of view of the librarian,
and Professor David Snedden of Stan
ford University spoke from the school
man's standpoint.
Mr. Green, librarian of the, Oakland
Free Public Library, and Mr. Water
man, Superintendent of Schools In
Berkeley, who were present" as guests
of the association, were ar&o prevailed
upon to address the meeting.
All the speakers urged the need of a
systematic and discriminating use of
library privileges as an important part
of the administrative policy of the
school.
On Saturday the .Council of Women
heard a thoroughgoing discourse in
Golden Gate Hall on innovations in â or
rather a reconstruction of â our school
management and the usage of our
school buildings. The very clever Dr.
Annie Dolman Inskeep, with degrees
from the University of California and
also from the University of Chicago
(with sociology and political science her
major subjects), explained in forceful
terms the plans she advocates, to wit:
The occupancy of the schoolhouse from
7 a. m. to 10 p. m.; that the children
of one section begin their work at 7 a.
m. and end it at 12:15 midday, to be
followed by a second lot at 12:15, who
would work to 4:15. After this - the
school grounds would be thrown open
to the urchins under the supervision of
trained men and women. Mothers'
clubs, improvement clubs, night schools
and lecturers should, under the speak
er's plan, have the use of the school
house until 10 p. m. Thus would the
property of the taxpayers bear Interest
in educational progression.
Mrs. Arthur Cornwall explained
briefly the altruistic effect of the chil
dren's playground created by the Cali
fornia Club and now under control of
the Board of Education.
Mrs. Dorcas Spencer brought to the
council the very good news that the
Northern California Indian Association
was straining every nerve to. induce
Congress to grant to the Indians land
in severalty. Surely, with our alleged
regretful conscience over our hitherto
scandalous conduct to the real Native
Sons of California, let us wish the as
sociation success to its efforts.

"Queen" on a Derelict Liferaft.
SALINAS, Feb. 7. â Further inves
tigation to discover the Identity.' of
the liferafts picked up by a steam
launch in Monterey Bay was made
yesterday. The rafts Â«were hauled up
on the beach. - One has the words "S.
S. Queen" painted on it. The words
"Capacity for sixteen persons" was
stamped on each.
The steamer Queen of the Pacific
Coast Steamship Company, arrived in
this port yesterday from Victoria. Her
captain, made no report of having, lost
any of his liferafts, but it is thought
that those picked up in the Monterey
harbor probably were washed over
board from the vessel during the
heavy sea that was running at the
time of her* arrival there.

ROCKEFELLER
WILL RETIRE
Friends of the Millionaire
State That Ho Will Separate
From All Business Interests
HIS SOX TO SUCCEED HIM
3fagnate Actuated in Decision
by Consciousness of Grow
ing Years and 111 Health
Special Dispatch to The Call,
TARRYTOWN. N. Y., Feb. 7.â It was
stated to-day by a man in close rela
tions to John D. Rockefeller that it is
now well understood among intimate
friends of the millionaire that he is
making definite preparations to "retire
from the cares of business. His resig
nation from the directorate of the
Steel Trust a few days ago was cited
as the first significant step in the. car
rying cut of this plan. The same
authority said that Rockefeller will re
sign almost immediately from a score
of other directorships which he holds
and that his son, John D. Rockefeller
Jr., will be substituted in his place. In
this connection is quoted from a letter
of resignation sent to the steel board
the following: "It has not been con
sistent for me to attend the meetings
of the board. My Interest in the cpm
pany is represented on the board "by
my son, and I hope the vacancy caused
by my resignation can be filled to the
advantage of the company by* some
one who can personally attend meet
ings."
Rockefeller's decision is said to be
due primarily to a request of his wife
and family, who urge him to rest, and
to his consciousness of growing years
and delicate health. It is said that he
will make his permanent home at Po
cantico Hills, spending a greater part
of his time there, where he is planning
to erect a $500,000 house.
The younger Rockefeller is said to be
fully conversant with all his father's
vast interests and will actively repre
sent them.
BIG FORESTS
WILL BE CUT
America to Furnish Capital
for Hewing- the Gigantic
Timber of the Philippines
A. Burlingame Johnson, formerly of
Denver but now a resident of Manila,
where he organized the.company which
is building a fifty-mile electric road
through that city under a special con
cession from the Philippine Commis
sioners, arrived at the Palace Hotel
yesterday on his way to the islands, for
which he will sail this week on the
steamer Gaelic.
Mr. Johnson bears the distinction of
being the first to float in this country
bonds for a Philippine enterprise, New-
York capitalists having invested $3,500,
000 in the bonds of the electric railroakl
of which he Is the promoter. He Is re
turning to Manila with a number of
expert millwrights, who have been en
gaged to go there and pass judgment
on a big saw mill enterprise of which
he is the head. Mr. Johnson said:
One of tho greatest drawbacks to progress
in Manila is the high price of lumber there.
We are importing large quantities from this
coast and a good deal from Borneo, but the
cost Is bo great that the people cannot buy
it and so they continue to build thatch shacks.
The poorest quality of Pacific Coast lumber,
laid down in Manila, costs from $Â»'Â» to Â£80 a
thounand, the necessity of lightering adding
much to the expense. It probably seems strange
to the outside world that the city of Manila
should have to Import Â« lumber for building
purposes, when the islands abound with for
ests. The. fact Is, however, the topography
Is so mountainous that it is difficult as well
as expensive to log the product to mills. Our
enterprise, which . is expected to furnish
enough material for a mill of 200,000 feet daily
capacity, developed out of an effort of ex-Gov
ernor Taft ~to encourage the lumber Industry
on the islands and thereby promote the interest
of the latter. We were granted concessions
under which wÂ« pay the Government stumpage
and after much searching were successful
in finding a place where, with the use of
donkey engines and trolley cables, we will
be able to get our logs out of the forests.
Tho demand for lumber, however, is so great
that whatever supply we create will In no way
diminish the export business from Pacific
Coast ports, but may compete with the trade
with Borneo.
Regarding the new street railroad in
Manila, Johnson said its construction
is being pushed as rapidly as possible.
A feature of the road is the fact that
first and second class cars have to be
used, which makes its a bit more ex
pensive than the railroads in this coun
try. Governor Taft at first objected to
discriminating rates, but after he had
conferred with the wealthier Spanish
dons of Manila who will not conde
scend to ride with peons he readily ap
preciated the need of separate cars for
the two classes. Strangely, while the
dons refuse to ride In cars operated for
the poorer classes, they show no objec
tion to the poorer people riding in their
cars if they pay the higher fare.

MILITARY ROLE
IS DENOUNCED
Representatives of Labor Or
ganizations Protest Against
Methods Pursued in Colorado
At a mass-meeting held in the Al
hambra Theater last night under the
auspices of the American labor union
organizations of San Francisco to pro
test against "military despotism in
Colorado." Governor Peabody, the mili
tary authorities, certain members of
the judiciary and the owners of the
mines at Telluride and Cripple Creek
were soundly rated.
James A. Smith, president of the
State Council of the American Labor
Union, presided. He outlined briefly
the purposes of the meeting and made
some stirring remarks regarding abuses
of authority by. high officials. He then
introduced .Charles M. Hurlbut of Den
ver, a member of the United Brother
hood of Railway Employes. His ad
dress was a direct attack upon Gpv
ernor Peabody of Colorado for his con
duct during the strike. He drew a har
rowing picture of the horrors of the
bull-pen, to which he said innocent men
were dragged at night with no charge
against them. The military authorities
never attempt to prosecute any person
placed under arrest, according to the
speaker, but as soon as he is released
upon one charge he Is Immediately re
arrested on another. The employes of
the Colorado Fuel and Iron Company
are subjected to inhuman treatment,
according to reports. Forty of them
are crowded into a room so small that
they have barely room to stretch their
limbs at night, and the food furnished
is of the poorest quality, but the price
is high.
Arthur Lewis and Mrs. Lewis of the
Federal Union followed with addresses,
in which the advisability of working
men standing together was strongly
emphasized. F. R. Whitney of the
Street Carmen's Unicn introduced
resolutions condemning Governor Pea
body, the military authorities, the Citi
zens' Alliance and the Mine Owners*
Association.
Prior to the adoption of the resolu
tions a collection was taken up in be
half of the striking miners in Colorado
and about J55 was realized. The meet
ing closed with a brief address by
Thomas Booth $f the Amalgamated
Society of Engineers.
MYSTERY ATTACHES TO

Bresnan, Private in Irons at Kan
sas City, Arouses Curiosity.
KANSAS CITY. Mo., Feb. 7.âThom
as Bresnan. a private soldier, charged
with desertion is being held in a post
guardhouse and the manner of his
confinement is causing much specula
tion as to his real history. He 'is
known to have given several different
names. The military authorities will
not discuss his case. He is heavily
ironed, the shackles having been
forged on his limbs at the post black
smith shop. Two guards keep watch
over him in a small cell day and
night. The authorities evidently con
sider him a very 1 dangerous man. It
is rumored that he deserted trom the
army in the Philippines and went over
to the natives. It is also rumored
that he is the Bresnan who escaped
from. Angel Island in San Francisco
Bay by having I himself crated in a
box and shipped out as merchandise.

Strength I>om Proper Breathing.
The Japanese, although men of very
F.T.all statue, are among the strongest
in the world. Any boy of fourteen or
fifteen who will faithfully practice their
Fystem of producing strength will find
himself, at the end of a few months,
able to cope in feats of power with the
:Â«verajre man 6t~ twenty-five, and all
this without the dangerous practice of
lifting very heavy weights. It should
always be remembered that rest must
be taken after each exercise. While
resting try deep breathing. Stand
erect, though not In a strained position,
and at each breath draw the abdomen
in and throw the chest out. As the
breath is exhaled let the chest fall in
ward again and the abdomen outward.
From twenty minutes to half an hour is
n long enough, time to devote to jiu
jitsu, and this includes the time spent
in breathing during rests â for deep, cor
rect breathing is in itself one of the
best exercises possible. In inhaling
draw the breath through either the
nostrils or the mouth, as preferred; in
exhaling always let the breath escape
through the mouth. â St. Nicholas. .

ISSUES A CALL
FOR CONFERENCE
California Organization An
nounces Meeting of Boards
of Charity and Correction
WILL SIT FOB THREE BAYS
Eminent Speakers From East
of the Rocky Mountains Are
Scheduled to Participate
The California State Conference of
Charities and Corrections announces Its
third annual session, which will be held
in San . Francisco, beginning Sunday,
February 21, and continuing three days
and evenings.
The programme, which Is being ar
ranged by the Associated Charities of
Ban Francisco and the State Board of
Charities and Corrections, la not com
plete in all Its details, but the pres
ence is assured of two eminent work
ers and speakers from east of the
Rocky Mountains. These are Rev.
Samuel G. Smith of St. Paul, Minn.,
and Judge Ben B. Lindsey of the
Juvenile Court of Denver, Colo.
Rev. Dr. Smith will be well and fa
vorably remembered by those that at
tended the State conference held here
in February. 1902. While it was a lib
eral education In broad and organized
charity work to listen to him, It was
also an inspiration, so full of enthusi
asm were his manner and his speech.
It is certain that his presence at that
time and his unceasing work at all the
sessions, besides his brilliant special
addresses, had much to do with crys
tallizing a public opinion which led a
year later to the enacting by the State
Legislature of the three laws oreating
a State Board of Charities and Cor
rections, a Juvenile Court and a sys
tem of probation for older prisoners.
Judge Lindsey presides over a Juven
ile Court which operates through a law
in some respects entirely unique. He
regards his Juvenile Court as the
most important work of his life and is
giving to it his time, talent and energy
in unstinted measure. The story he
will tell In San Francisco of his expe
rience for two years and moreâ of his
methods, which have attracted the at
tention of the English speaking world
and have brought to him requests from
all over America and England to im
part the results of his work â and the
scores of fascinating Illustrations he
will use, will be of Intense interest
here in San Francisco, where the
Juvenile Court, under Judge Murasky.
is in the first year of its existence and
operation.
The main subjects to which attention
will be given at this coming State con
ference are the following:
1. "â¢Juvenile Court Work and Possibilities,"
led by Judge Lindsey.
2. "What Organized CharHr Means and
What It Deserves From the Community," led
by V>t. Samuel G. Smith.
3. "The Dependent Child and Its Care â the
Children's Agency," led by Herbert W. Lewis,
superintendent or the Boys' and Girls' Aid
Society, who â¢will gl\-e a popular lecture illus
trated by stereoptlcon views.
4. "The State Board of Charltlea and Its
Plans," liy W". A. Gates, secretary of thÂ«
board.
The place of the conference will be
announced later. The State Board of
Charities and Corrections will co-oper
ate with the Associated Charities
throughout the conference and the
presence and co-operation of all per
sons Interested in effective charity
work are earnestly asked by the As
sociated Charities of San Francisco.

DIES ALONE
IN HAY BARN
Former Manager of an Immense
California Eanch Passes
Away in Town of Santa Clara
EMPLOYE FINDS THE BODY
Sick Man Seeks Shelter in a
Dreary Building and Death
Terminates His Suffering
SANTA CLARA. Feb. 7.â The dead
body of George Classen was found In
the hay barn of J. C. McPherson, in the
business section of town, this morn
ing, by George Bullock, an employe.
Classen had entered the barn to sleep
during the night, having been sick for
several days from pneumonia. He had
been employed as a foreman on the
Miller & Lux ranch, near Gilroy, and
was in that employ up to a week ago.
He was formerly foreman on a ranch
near Oakdale, Stanislaus county, for a
man named Howell, who is employed
by the A. P. Hotaling Company in San
Francisco. Correspondence showed
that he had been trusted in every par
ticular by those for whom he worked.
He had been insured in. two companies
and had made payments up to the time
of his wife's death four years ago.
For twelve years he lived in San
Luis Obispo county, where he was in
charge of the Shackelford ranch. When
Shackelford failed in business Classen
lost heavilv in wages he had Intrusted
to Shackelford and 111 fortune seemed
to pursue him from that time. His wife
died; he lost his investments and be
came penniless. Bank books showed
him . to have been possessed of ,f unds
at a recent date. He had many friends
here and in other parts of the State
who would have willingly helped him,
but he chose to risk exposure in a hay
barn rather than ask friends for shel
ter.- He leaves two children who are
now in a convent at Gilroy.
Coroner Kell held an inquest this
afternooii and a verdict of death from
acute pneumonia was rendered.
A Weather Press Agrent.
A man came In the other morning
with water falling from his hat brim,
his beard and hair as wet as moss on a
grub" oak in a season of excess pre
cipitation. The water rolled back and
forth in his shoes as he stepped across
the room. He was as thoroughly
soaked as it was possible for any mov
ing ceature to be, and held in trust
enouph rain to interest several Irriga
tion conventions. He was observed to
I00K up cheerfully and remark, casting
an eye at the weather, that it was
"clouding up some."â Albany (Ore.)

HANNA WEAK
AND RESTLESS
Condition of Senator Shows
No Eadical Change, bnt
the Family Is Hopeful
DOCTOBS IN CONSULTATION
Patient Is Permitted to Talk
but Little and the Only
Nourishment Taken Is Milk
WASHINGTON. Feb. 7.â Senator
Hanna passed to-day without any rad
ical change in his condition. His ex
treme weakness tvas more marked than
heretofore and his temperature wai
stationary. Those attending him, how
ever, insist there ia nothing significant
In these conditions and that there ara
no developments on which to change
their expressed belief that the outlook
Is hopeful for the Senator's recovery.
There was a consultation of Dr. Rixey
and two out-of-town physicians during
the day, but the only important devel
opment that transpired as to the con
sultation was that It had been decided
to omit the evening call of the attend
ing physicians so as to give the pa
tient more rest.
The consultation was held about 4
o'clook this afternoon. Those who par
ticipated beside Dr. Rlxey,. the surgeon
general of the navy, who Is the regular
attending physician, were Dr. Osier, the
expert diagnostician of Johns Hopkins
University of Baltimore, and Dr. Brew
er of New York, who has frequently at
tended Senator Hanna in New York
and who Is familiar with his general
condition. Immediately after the con
sultation the following^ bulletin was Is
sued:
"Senatpr Hanna is doing well. His
morning temperature was a little high
er, but the heart's action is good and
there are no complications.
"DRS. RIXEY AND OSLER."
j. The Senator was very restless 'last
night and gained little sleep. This, to
gether with the general course of the
fever, it is said, accounts for his weak
er condition and increased nervousness
to-day. The physicians explain that it
is to be expected that the fever will in
crease until the crisis is past, but they
do not name any definite date when
that crucial point will be reached. The
Senator is taking no nourishment ex
cept milk. He is too weak to talk ex
cept in occasional few words to those
who are attending him, Mrs. Hanna
and Miss Phelps, his niece, being the
only ones permitted to see him besides
the physicians and trained nurses.
Mrs. Hanna has been a steady at
tendant at his bedside, and shows the
effects of the strain she is undergoing.
Miss Phelps remained at the apart
ments so as to be present, In case Â°* ner
services being needed, paniel B. Han
na of Cleveland, a brother, asked by.
telephone if his presence was needed
and said he would come at once If
there was anything in the Senator's
condition to suggest his coming. Mrs.
Hanna, however, advised him that
there was no immediate danger, and
acting on that advice he has made no
plans so far to come, to Washington.
H. M. Hanna of Thoniasvllle, Ga., an
other brother, i* expected late to-night.
He has retired from and Mrs.
Hanna wanted him here to advise with
her over the situation.
Senator Hanna "frequently asks for
his secretary, Elmer Dover, but pre
texts have been used to shift his atten
tion from business matters. Dover nad
expected to go to Chicago to attend an
important meeting of a eub-committee
of the Republican National Committee,
but remained here on account of the
Senator's condition.

The Waterfall of Mount Ccnis.
On the Italian side of Mont Cenis is
a picturesque torrent, or waterfall, the
Ceritschla. which carries off the waters
of the melting glaciers. The quantity
of water is not large, but the descent
In considerable, some 900 yards. About
forty miles away stands the great city
of Turin: the reader' can guess the rest
of tho story. A hydro-erectric instal
lation Ih to be set up at the foot of the
mountain, and th$ engineers, Messrs.
Thompson and Houston, reckon on de
riving from the waterfall and transmit
ting to Turin 10.000 horsepower. For
untold thousands of years the torrent
hurt Hplanhed down the mountain side,
and henceforth, for a period that can
not bo f (/recast, it will be furnishing
Turin with light, heat and energy.
Many a mountain stream and cascade
in Piedmont and Lombardy will in the
near future be turned into a source of
electrical power, which, to a country
like Italy, that imports its coal, is an
economical matter of great moment. â

NOTED POLOIST
AT BURLINGAME
Neil Haig, One of the Most
Prominent English Players,
Here to Take Part in Games
MATCHES FOR THIS WEEK
Four Teams Will Meet in 4 a
Tournament Preliminary to
the Coming Del Monte Affair
The colony of po-loists at Burlingame
Country Club has been materially
strengthened during the past week by
the addition of the English players who
have -been in Southern Californiaâ
Messrs. Garland, F. J. Mackey and
Neil Haig. - The latter ranks second to
W. S. Buckmaster of England, who is
considered the world's greatest poloist.
Mr. Haig weighs 1230 pounds, and how
fc-urteen and a half hand ponies carry
him in a fast game is difficult to un
derstand.
As a preliminary to the coast cham
pionship polo tournament, which opens
at Del Monte on the 18th inst., a series
of games will be played at Burlingame
to-mcrrow, Thursday and Sunday. Six
teen players, divided into four teams,
will take part and the outcome will
give a line on the possible strength of
the Burltngame representatives in the
international match,*
All critics of the game agree that the
Burlingame men have gone in too
much for individual playing to the
neglect of team work. Walter Hobart
get the fashion in this years ago and
it is still the vogue.
The California enthusiasts have not
abandoned hope of seeing some of the
East-.-rn experts here next month. It is
possible George J. Gould and his sons'
may come, and Foxhall Keene is also
a likely visitor. Harry Payne Whit
ney intended coming, but the death of
his father upsets his plans.
An Eastern writer discussing polo
says:
Under the revision* of the playing rules to
be made by the Hurltncham Polo Club, aside
from a better codification, there is a firm
Ftar.d against all forms of dangerous riding
or swinging: of the mallet. A new clause U
that when two players are riding abreast, no
player Â£hall strike at the ball over or under
the body or across the legs of an adversary's
pony. Also, a player who drops or breaks his
Etick. may, under the proposed code, borrow
one from one of his own side. The latter point
is new and important- It will be more ef
fective In the English game, where the ex
periment has been tried In playing No. 1 with
out a mallet, than In this country, for in off
side i lay No. 1 needs his stick as often as
any of Â«he buncn. On the contrary, under
the no-off-4de rule. No. 1 Is chiefly useful in
riding off the back, for, should he get a chance
to run with the ball, the back has only to
pull up to put him out of the game. Many
occasions may arise, however, in our game
when the team might gain an advantage
should passing sticks be permitted. Instead
of forcing; the player who is minus to dismount
to pick up his mallet or ride to the side lines
for a fresh one.
Marquis de Villavieja of the Societe de Polo
of Par!? who was in consultation last week
with Chairman Herbert and Secretary Hazard
of the Polo Association, is still hopeful that an
American team will go over in June for the
international tournament for the James.Gor
don Bennett cups at the Bagatelle grounds, al
though he realizes that this is to be an event
ful year for the game over here. The condi
tions of the Dagatelle tournament favor the
h^pes of the marquis, for they permit the
presence of but one top-notcher on a team, and
this may' bring -a- -*piek--up* 1 four 'Of touring
Americans to the contest.
The tornctchers are those whom we would
term here nine or ten goal men. for while
our handicap pvntem Is not used by the Hurl
lr.gham Club, the beÂ«t players her* are named
each season on its "recent form" list and
theism so rateci arÂ« barred from certain re
stricted- competitions at Hurlingham and else
where. The five who went over In 1902 â the
Waterbury*. AgassU, Cowdin and Keene â were
put on this lbÂ«t. an acknowledgment of their
skill in the high school of polo, and It Is also
not generally known that L.. WaUrbury played
back in that year in the team that won the
Hurllnrham championship cup. the others
being Harold BraM>ey. A. Rawllnson and W.
S. Buckmacter. Two of our players. C. H.
Mackey and Foxball Ke*ne, were on the team
to win the Parts International tournament In
IJ>CO. ThÂ« Hamburg: Polo Club has written to
Secretary Hazard asking for advice regarding
the shipment cf its ponies to St. Louie. It Is
expected that a definite announcement about
the coming of a Hurlingham team will be
made at the annual meeting of the Polo Asso
ciation in Aoril.

Four Men Killed and Three
AVounded in a Pistol Fight
at Coal Creek, Tennessee
KNOXVILLE. Tenn.. Feb. 7.â In a
fight at the Coal Creek (Tenn.) depot
to-day four men were killed and three
bystanders were wounded by two
guards employed by the Coal Creek
Company. A deputy sheriff who went
to arrest a guard was killed.
The clash was the culmination of
trouble between union and non-union
labor. Three of the dead men were
killed by guards employed by the Coal
Creek Coal Company, and the fourth
victim, a deputy sheriff, was killed by
a guard he had .gone to arrest. The

Guards were at the railroad station

yelled "scab" and it is said the guards
were insulted or an attempt made to
take the non-union men away from

DENNIS' HOUNDS
RUN ONE-TWO
Reneg-ade Apache Captures the
Stake and Game Racing Auto
Lauds "With Second Honors
WINNER A BIG FAVORITE
Eagle Makes a Good Showing
but Loses in Fifth Kound
After a Tiresome Bun
Greyhounds from the kennel of Jack
Dennis carried off all 'the honors and
the long end of the purse yesterday at
Union Coursing Park. When the decid
ing course was run Renegade Apache
carried off first prize, with Racing Auto
as runner-up. The coursers deserved
all the honors they won, as they ran in
great form throughout the day.
The bright sunshine during the after
noon enticed a big crowd to the park,
and betting was lively from the outset.
About twenty short-enders got away
with the coin, some of them being big
and Juicy surprises. Renegade Apache
was a 1 to 6 choice in ' the deciding
course, and when the dogs were slipped
he showed he was worth the price. jHe
led Racing Auto from the first and
never allowed his kennel mate a point.
He took many turns out of the hare and
succeeded in killing before Racing Auto
had secured a good start. Many figured
Eagle would have a swell chance in the
final going, but Racing Auto simply
did a cakewalk with him in the semi
final round and killed the hare without
half trying. Eagle had just come in
from a severe trial with Free Born, and
he was : led twenty Lengths. He ran
slower with every bound, as his
strength was gone and he tired quickly.

INSURING CURRENCY
IN TRANSMISSION
Banks Even Guard Against Loss of
Money Shipped by Registered
Mail Service.
The careless way with which large
packages of bank notes were tossed
through the windows of the New York
postofflce recently for transmission to
out-of-town points has "excited the
wonder of persons familiar with the
risks involved and the sums at stake.
The movement is specially heavy Just
now, aggregating from $3,000,000 to
$5,000,000 a week, and including con
signments from most of the large banks
and banking houses .in the city. The
currency is sent everywhere in single
packages, containing $10,000 or less,
protected by policies of insurance pro
tecting the owners against every pos
sible hazard at rates varying from 15
to 80 cents per $1000 of currency in
sured. Most of the notes are five, ten
and twenty dollar denominations, be
sides supplies of ones and twos for use
as "hand-to-hand money" for crop
movement purposes.
These transfers go to all sections of
the United States. Canada, Great Brit
ain and to continental- points. The
business has now grown to large pro
portions, and is written by some of the
strongest Insurance companies . of
Europe and America. One very inter
esting claim paid a few days ago was
for; the loss of a parcel containing
$2700 *.n bank, notes shipped through
the mails by a Canadian institution.
The destination was a. small postoillce
where the business was so light that
the postmaster, not having the use of
a safe in which to store valuables, was
forced to take home every night unde
livered registered mail that arrived
during the day. The package of bank
notes was , taken out of the office in
this* way, and just before the post
master reached home he was attacked
by footpads and relieved of the money.
The loss was immediately reported,
and the insurance company at once re
imbursed the institution, at the same
time offering $500 reward .for the de
tection of the thief. The case has not
been cleared up yet.
Packages containing $20,000 of in
sured bank notes were on the train
that went through a bridge in a South
ern State recently. New York under
writers were much concerned over the
incident until they discovered that the
car In which the insured packages were
stored remained safe on the rails. The
largest single risk ever written was
taken in England some time ago, when
one package containing $25,000,000 was
insured.
Warming to the Shoulder.
The Duzens are very proud of their
little Eddie. They never neglect ' an
opportunity to show him off., The other
evening they were exhibiting him to a
company of his sister's guests when
one of the young women asked him for
a kiss, which he refused. .
"What?" eaid she. ' "Are you going
to give me the cold shoulder?"
Eddie brightened up and rather irrel
evantly said: "Mr.Spooner gave sister
Edna the. cold shoulder last night. 1 I
peeked through the keyhole . a,nd saw
her warming it with her cheek."âEx

Field at x Ingleside Park
Ingleside Park was the' ccene of a
great day's coursing yesterday and the
large crowd of enthusiasts that turned
out to see the greyhounds run received
more than the worth of its money.
Quita won the stake after, a severe
trial with Full Moon in the deciding
course of the stake, \ the score being
6 to 1.
In fact Quita "was given many a
hard run all along the line until she
finally won out. In nearly every
course the Sacramento greyhound had
to keep in the going every moment.
This she did gamely.
It was a good day" for those who
backed the favorite, while the wise
ones who were playing the likely

VETERANS PLAY
IN GOOD FORM
Taylor Brothers Prove Star
Performers on the Califor
nia Tennis Club Courts
The threatening condition of . the
weather kept a number of players from
the tennis courts yesterday. At the
California Club courts reveral good
matches were played before the courts
became too wet.' Will Taylor and Gus
Taylor were thejstar performers of the
day. They met Chester Smith and
Sidney Salisbury in a good two-set
match.
The losers were by no means at their
best, but nevertheless the victory of
the Taylors was a well-earned one.
They played good, steady teams and
outclassed their opponents from â¢ the
start. Never after the first two games
was the outcome in doubt. Will Tay
lor's net 'work was particularly good,
while his handling of deep lobs was
the feature of the match. . His brother
executed many clever drives and was
HtUe behind the ex-champion of the
coast in point of skill. >"W
Later in the day Salisbury and Smith
showed remarkable improvement when
they defeated Bay Cornell and .Drum
mond MacGavIn. ; The winners took the
first set with the loss of only two
games. With the score 5-2 against
them, Cornell and MacGavIn braced
and annexed the next three games.
This brought, the score to 5-5. At this
point the rain set In and interrupted
further play. ' v .
â¢ In the only three-set match of the
day Sidney Salisbury and Harry Rolfe
won from Paul Jones and Carl Gard
ner. The outcome of this -match was
in doubt until the last point had been
won. Jones and Gardner won the first
set easily. Their driving and smashing
were particularly good. In the next
two sets Rolfe and Salisbury were in
clined to take more chances, which
proved the more successful style of
play They won the second set, 6^4.
In the third set Jones and Gardner
nearly won, requiring only one point
to win at 5-4 and 40-30. ' Rolfe and
Salisbury, however,, took the next two
games and match.
The scores follow:

heavy hauls of partridges being- ship
ped out of North Carolina in violation
of the game laws of the State. His
latest capture Is the biggest yet made
and consists of 448' nne birds in egg
crates that had been shiooed to a
commission merchant in Washington,
D. C. The outlay, which repesented
about $30 expended by the shipper,
would have netted him all of $100 had
his shipment reached this city. There
were four of the "egR crates," and each
had the regulation layer of eggs on
the top and bottom.
Game Warden Weatherly'8 dog, with
his keen and unfailing sense of smell,
singled out; the egg crates containing
birds, and when they were opened, sure
enough; Just the crates that the dog
whined over contained the -forbidden
partridges. All birds seized by the
game warden are sold at auction, the
proceeds going to ,the State.âWashing

FOOTBALL MEN

Sodden and Slippery Grounds
Cause Postponement of Two
Scheduled League Contests
ONE MATCH AT ALAMEDA
Albion Rovers and Occidentals
Tie With One Goal Apiece
in Rather Rough
Only one scheduled match for the
championship of the California Asso
ciation Football League was- played
yesterday. This ended in a tie between
the Occidentals and the Albion Rovers.
The match between the Vampires and
the Oakland Hornets that was sched
uled to be played on the ground at Ido
ra Park was called off on account of
the sodden, slippery condition of the
field. . ,>
In the morning the match between
the Thistles and the Pickwicks was not
â¢played, no referee being present and the
ground being too wet. A team of eight
Thistles played a friendly game against
the Pickwicks, neither side securing a
goal. The Thistle team was made up
of W. McGregor, goalkeeper; Taylor,
back; Duncan, J. . McGregor and A.
â¢Dlsher, halfbacks; Smith, King and T.
S. Lydon, forwards. During the first
half Lyden made several shots at the
goal, but none of them went between
the posts, Knight stopping them with
great success.
In the second half the Pickwicks nar
rowly missed scoring on more than one
occasion, but the game ended with no
score for either side. The Pickwick
team lined up as follows: Knight, goal
keeper; Bouton. leftback; Conway.
rightback; A. E. Bowcock, left half
back; Watson, center halfback; Todd,
right halfback; Murdock, outside left;
W. T. Bowcock, inside left; Cowan, cen
ter forward: Warren, inside right; Rob
ertson, outside right. Hugh William
son acted as referee. >- â¢"/>-;
In the morning a Vampire team
played a practice game on the Alameda
grounds against the Hospital Corps of
Alameda. The Vampire team included
three first eleven men and won, four
goals to two.
Shortly after 2:30 p. m. on the Ala
meda grounds the ball was kicked off
in the match between the Albion Rov
ers and the Pickwicks, C. W. Irish be
ing the referee and the* linesmen being
Arthur Robinson and D. Jamieson.
After a few minutes' play the Rovers
put the ball Jnto the net, but the referee
gave offside against them. Similar luck
shortly afterward befell the Occiden
tals. Later the referee awarded a free
kick at goal within the penalty area
to the Occidentals, who scored. A sec
ond goal was declared offside and the
first period ended with' one goal for
the Occidentals against nothing for the
Albion Rovers. In the last three min
utes of the second half Tweedle put tbe
ball into the net for the Albion Rovers
and the match ended in a tie.
During the latter part of the second
half 1 John played forward for the Rov
ers, Duquesne taking his place at back.
Almost at the end of the game Lan
caster and Hlggins came into collision,
Higgins being knocked out and getting
severely injured about the eye. The
game throughout tended to be some
what rough, the players being encour
aged In this respect by the ill-timed
suggestions of their supporters on the
sidelines. The ground was in excellent
condition and the match was keenly
contested. The teams lined up In the

ISLAND OF JAMAICA
What American Housekeepers May
Learn From Their Sisters of
the Tropics.
,A Jamaican woman who was travel
ing out "West some time ago heard
complaints about the swarms of ants
which infested every house and got
into all the food.
* "There is a very simple remedy." she
told her Western friends. "Rub chalk
on the legs of the cupboard. The ants
cannot crawl up over the chalk."
Lime juice or lemon juice is the "West
Indian housekeeper's best friend.
Should any of the house linen or wear-
Ing apparel become^ mildewed in rainy
weather a little lemon juice and a lit
tle common salt will soon make the
spots disappear. This receipt appears
to be unknown in this country, and
mildew is too oftenregarded as a thing
impossible to remove. Even the pro
fessional laundries nearly always send
home clothes without removing the
mildew spots from them. Many a shirt
waist or other article of apparel Is
thrown away solely for this reason
while it is still perfectly fit to wear.
If the American housekeeper will try
this West Indian recipe she will get rid
of an enemy thitherto regarded as un
conquerable. So far as is known, noth
ing else will remove mildew.
West Indians have several good re
cipes for keeping mosquitoes out of
the house. Although they live in a
mosquito-haunted region, they are
much less bothered by these pests than
people are in the subtropical parts of
the United States. A favorite recipe
is to pluck a number of castor oil leaves
and twigs and place them about the
house. A bunch Is placed over the
dining-room table and another bunch
over each of the beds. Mosquitoes love
the leaf of the castor plant, and they
collect upon it and leave the family
alone. â Washington Star.

AMATEUR CLUBS
FORSAKE P.A.A.
Prize Fight Promoters Decide
to Perfect nn Organization
for Their Special Benefit
WILL CONTROL THE SPORT
Officers and a Board of Direct
ors Are to Be Elected at
a Special 3Ieetin^ To-Night
As a result of the action taken by the
Pacific Athletic Association In sus
pending the prompters of the last fight
given under the auspices of the Lin
coln Athletic Club, together with the
principals who took part in the affair,
the amateur fight .managers have de
cided to break away from the associa
tion and will form an organization
among themselves to control the ama
teur boxing game in this city and in
Oakland.
Such was the decision reached by the
managers of the various clubs yester
day. Those interested in the movement
include the Bay City Club, Lincoln
Club, San Francisco Club and Hayes
Valley Club, all of this city, and the
Sequoia Club and the West End Club
of Oakland. The managers of each
organization say they have determined
to see the thing through and will break
away from the P. A. A. at any cost.
It is understood that the promoters
of the Lincoln Club are at the bottom
of the plot. They became angry at the
registration committee of the associa
tion when that body suspended them
and their boxers for alleged profes
sionalism and quietly tipped it around
that they would not submit to the pen
alty.'
The Lincoln Club has advertised a
bout for this week, although Its license
has been temporarily suspended and it
has no authority to hold such an exhi
bition. When the association â¢nembers
heard of this they stated they would
suspend the Lincoln Club permanently
and would irripeae a heavy fine on Its
managers before letting them back
into the fold again.
The managers of the club were se
cretly plotting against the association,
with the result that they succeeded in
getting the other clubs interested In
the new movement, and therefore the
forming of a new association is prac
tically an easy matter. Under the new
regime the clubs will have to pay only
a small sanction fee and the new asso
ciation will not trouble Itself about any
other sort of sport outside of boxing.
At the last meeting of the association
the board of managers decided to ap
point a special committee to look out
for boxing and to admit all the boxers
into the association under a separate
head. When the fight clubs heard of
this it may have prompted them to or
ganize among themselves, for they
thought as long as the association is
about to form a separate department
for the boxers they might as well have
control of it themselves.
The representatives of all the clubs
will meet to-night at 8 o'clock at the
clubrooms of the Hayes Valley Club
and will form a permanent organiza
tion. Omcers and a board of directors
will be elected and the new organiza
tion will then apply for a charter as an
amateur association.
The present move is considered a
mere subterfuge on the part of the box
ing, clubs. They want to pay younff
tloys a olttance and use the cloak of
amateurism to keep down the money
value of prises. At the same time they
evade the city ordinance which limits
professional boxing contests to one a
month. To all intents and purposes the
majority of their contests come under
this head.
Boxing does not lend itself to ama
teurism, as a man sacrifices more self
respect when he sustains a defeat in the
ring than he would in one on the cin
der path. There must be some recog
nized authority. As It has been impos
sible in the past to keep these pro
moters within the rules, it Is difficult
to see how they will improve conditions
when they hold the reins of govern
ment. '* v .'.j

Who Is Chris Lecsltt?
A most amusing little story is related
of the Hon. Rood Smeet, the Senator
from Eutaw.
It seems that a stranger who was in
Washington the other day visited the
Senate gallery, and while there he
asked a man sitting next to him If Sen
ator Smeet was anywhere in sight.
".Why. yes," said the roan, pointing
him out. "There he is."
The stranger looked in the direction
indicated and an expression of disap
pointment overspread bis face.
"Gosh!" he exclaimed. "Is that the
fellow the women are, making such a
dead set against? I don't see nothin*
wonderful about him. He looks Just
like Chris Leggitt!"
And now everybody In Washington is
wondering who Chris Leggltt is. â Chi

The cornerstone of the 'Evangelical

is famous among Lutherans in Amer
ica, followed with a stirring address,
saying, in part: **
My greeting' to you, my fellow Christians
and fellow Lutherans. 1*. "Follow the Master."
Some people have said the church ' is a lost
cause â that the church is Â«;mpty of Its congre
gation. Those same people will "speak thua
when, ae a matter of fact, they have not been
even seen within the walls of the church. The
growth of the Christian church has Increased to
enormous proportions within the last twenty
five years.
The Protestant cause is living and growing
â¢11 over the world. At the new year there
were 140.000.OtX), and of these 70,000.000 are

byterians. 4,O0Â«>.000 Congregationalists. and all
other Protestant churches number 8,000,000.
therefore we are a great host and growing all
the time.

we have 501 clergymen and a membership fit
250.000 and church property valued at $6,000, -
000. In our Swedish Lutheran College we have
2000 students. ' . .
The fact of the matter is, Lutherans are too
humble. Tou do not blow your i own . horn
enough. You do not tell of your growth.
Think of the orphanages we have, the three
large hspltals and the Deaconesses' Institute.
It is because you are so humble and do not
speak of these things that those 'who' do not
know better say that we are not a great host.
When this church has been completed, even

take in not building It larger. My own church
has been rebuilt four times In thirty years, j

religion of a Christian is like and what it

Christ would have you do. The chief tenet in
the religion of a Christian Is love. Show mer-

OLD FAVORITES
AT CALIFORNIA
Murray and 3Iack Present "A
Night on Broadway" and
Please a Crowded House
JST3W ACTS AT OBPHEUil
Revised Bill Introduces Some
Novelties â First * Sunday
Popular Concert a Success
Murray and Mack presented their
latest absurdity, "A Night on Broad
way," to as many people as could be
seated in the California Theater last
evening- The unanimous verdict of
those, present, expressed in frequent
laughter and applause, was that no
bet.ter entertainment of its kind has
been offered for similar prices in this
city this season.
The programme announces that the
"book" of "A Night on Broadway" 'was
written by one Campbell and one Skin
ner, but it is plainly evident that the
piece was mostly built piecemeal fcy the
persons on the. stage. If it ever had
anything resembling a plot, all trace
of that feature is now lost in the con
glomeration of nonsense subscribed by
the comedians. The music is lively,
but unmarked by originality. The
staging Is very good for a road show.
The chorus is neither .numerically im
mense nor remarkably strong in per
sonal charms, but it sings loudly and
with precision and -its costumes are
many, much varied and mostly hand
some, and there are several clever peo
ple besides the s'tars.
Bobby North, a Hebrew Impersona
tor, talks, walks and sings a la Barney
Bernard, and with more experience he
may become a dangerous rival of that
former local favorite. Then there is a
statuesque blonde billed as Miss Ger
trude Rutledge,' who sings well, reads
her lines clearly and shows consider
able'dramatic worth. Miss Kitty Beck,
a hard-working soubrette, also wins
favor, and the Le Velles, dancers, pre
sent a specialty that is at once unique
and clever. That -about, exhausts the
list of subordinates entitled to special
mention.
Murray and Mack -pursue the same
laugh-fetching tactics that they have
been following for ever so many years,
and age does not' seem to wither nor
time appear to decay, their popularity
with the upper tiers. " â¢
"A Night on Broadway" Is on for the
week.
The verdict of the Orpheum audience
last night Vas that each act on the
bill was well done. The show is a com
bination of clever talent and good
stunts, which puts it near the front on
the list of vaudeville collections.
Billy B. Van and Rose Beaumont
open in a very lively comedy sketch,
"My Busy Day." Van is not the Billy
Van,*. the "assassin of sorrow" of Hav
erly minstrel fame, but he is equally
as good and his work is Just as clever.
Van does the part of an Irish office
boy to the Hon. ' B. B. Blackstone,
attorney at law, with a sparkle and a
whirl. "â¢ Acting as an adviser during the
absence of his employer he finds op
portunity to display remarkable inge
nuity in comedy lines, and when . his
first client, in the person of Miss Beau
mont, arrived for consultation concern
ing a divorce the farce Becomes thor
ough.
John T. Thome and Grace Carleton,
on the programme as "the American
Jesters," offer an excellent dialogue.
Their witty passes are all new. Rice
and Elmer make a hit as comedy gym
nasts in "A Rube's First Visit to Chi
natown." One In the character of a
farmer and the other disguised as a
heaten . laundryman make their en
trance with mirthful banter and then
commence business on horizontal bars.
George B. Snyder and Harry Buckley
come back to the city in a musical act,
"Blatz Wants a Drink," and receive a
warm 1 welcome. They are thorough
musjcians.and during the intermissions
between their musical turns find oc
casion for interesting comedy. Stuart
Barnes, the Two Silvas. Robertus â¢ and,
Wilfredo and Monroe, Mack and Law
rence ar.e holdovers. -A moving picture,
that of a train robbery, proves an at
traction.
The first Sunday afternoon concert
by. the Koota Quartet and Mrs. Oscar
Mansfeldt at Lyric. Hall yesterday
drew a large audience and the indica
tions are that the new ideals likely to
become very popular.
Kopta achieved a 4 triumph with the
"Concert " Polonaise," by Lamb, : and
Nesvera's Eklogue. Mrs. .Mansfeldt
sang delightfully and the strong quar
tet was enthusiastically applauded for
each of its numbers.
The second concert will be. given
next Sunday afternoon. Manager Will
L. Greenbaum is the originator of these
entertainments in San Francisco. .
