Alone, Maryland's vote appears

Nevada is also somewhat in
doubt with her votes. Should both
of these States go for Parker
Roosevelt will still have 314
votes, the- number predicted by
Chairman Cortelyou at midnight.
It is more than a Republican
landslideâ it is an avalanche.
Roosevelt has been elected by
probably a greater plurality of the
popular vote than was ever cast
for a. nominee for President and
by a larger majority of the Elec
toral College than was eyer given
before. The people have decided
in favor of the administration at
Washington and against any
change in existing policies. The
result is a. vote of confidence in
President Roosevelt of such an
emphatic character as to stagger
an ordinary man and overwhelm
him with the responsibility with
which; that* vote will invest him

owing to the large number of scratched

crats estimate the number of scratched

claim that Adams will get two-thirds
of these insuring his election. The
Republicans claim Governor Peabody'a
re-election by 5000.

probability that the remainder of the
Democratic Stale ticket is also elected.
Democratic Chairman Smith will not
concede that Roosevelt has carried the
State and said:- "Adams' plurality will
not be less than 15,000."
Judge Parker threw open his doors
and everybody was made welcome.
After the first disappointment there

In the farm houses and in the city

farmers did not want a change
any more than did the-working

City literally went to pieces. What
became of the 125,000 plurality
for Parker and Herrick in New
York County that leader Murphy
qf Tammany was talking of?
What became of the 30,000 in

promised ? The Irish vote ap
pears very largely to have swung
to the support of the President
and some of it to the support of

"Doubtful" States.
The returns from New Jersey
appear to show an equally em-
phatic Republican victory. Mc-
Kinley carried the State in 1900
by about 57,000. Estimates, sub

At 3 a. m. the latsst figures on Gov

plurality for Herrick of 74.083, with

There was a great surprise in the
proportions of the vote for Higgins (R.)
for Governor, he running far ahead of
the Odell vote in the counties and win
ning by about 85,000. Herrick did not
c&rry Albany, his home county, nor did
Parker carry Ulster, in which he lives.

NEW YORK. Nov. 9. â At 3 a. m.
1T07 out of 1550 precincts in . New
York City reported a plurality of 35.
â¬18 for Parker, whose total vote, with
fc-rty-three precincts missing in the
greater city, was 314. 881. while that
for Roosevelt was 279,263. The, re
maining precincts were the outlying
sections and these figures are prac
tically comnlete.
The Parker plurality in the city was
3Â£,000 less than that given Herrick
<D.) for Governor.
NEW YORK, Nov. 8.â Theodore
Roosevelt's plurality in this, his native
State, i? second only to McKinley's
26is.0oO in 1S96. It exceeds McKinley's
in J900 by about 41.500. The late returns
show that there were cast for Roose
velt in New York State about 185,000
votes more than for Parker. Not only
â¢was his vote heavy in the country dis
tricts, where the Republican strong
holds are, but in greater New York,
traditionally Democratic, he ran much
closer to Judge Parker than had been
expected even by his own campaign
managers. .- -Â¦
It had been rumored that he would
come down to the Bronx with better
than 140,000 plurality, but the figures
to-night showed that this forecast
would be exceeded by approximately
85,000. In the city Parker's supporters
had expressed hopes that their candi
date would have from 140,000 to 160,000
more than Roosevelt, but In this they
were disappointed by more than 100,000-
So overwhelming was the Republican
vote that the result was known posi
tively early in the evening. The ear
liest counties to report made it clear
tliat the Parker vote everywhere fell
below Bryan's in practically all the up-
State districts. In Greater New York
Parker's plurality was from 12,000 " to
14,000 larger than Bryan's, but^ in the
Stale, according to toe late reports, his
tctal vote fell 16,000 short of Bryan's.
The small plurality for Parker in
New York City caused great astonish
ment, the lowest preliminary' ante-elec
tion estimates having given figures
that he would go to the Bronx with
100.000 plurality. When the reports
came in showing that he would lead
Roosevelt by only 40,000 they were re
ceived with amazement.

Even Maryland seems to have

The most Important personal feature
of the evening was the reception of
Judge Parker's telegram of congratula
tions, in which the Democratic candi
date said that the American people by
their votes had approved President
Roosevelt's administration. This tele
gram was brought to the President
while he was still in his library and
without . a moment's hesitation he
wrote this reply: "I thank you for
your kindness."
Apparently the President did not
consider that under the circumstances,
he was required to say more than this.
It is believed here that Roosevelt
would have been pleased to have ten
dered to Judge Parker an Important
judicial position within the gift of the
President, had ; not the personal rela
tions become somewhat strained at the
end of the campaign.
Later on he appeared at the window
of the Cabinet-room in response to
hearty cheers from the clubs outside
and spoke a fetf words to them.
It was plain from the President's
manner and from all that he said to
his friends who called to congratulate
him to-night that he was greatly
pleased with .the outcome of the elec
tion and especially with the part which
he himself played. In the last stage of
the campaign. He now feels that his
reply to Judge Parker in regard to the
charges : of collusion with the trusts
was not only wise, .but was at least
partlv necessary to Republican success.
He said frequently. during the last two
days that he was resolved to take the
opportunity for this reply, so that if
he was defeated it â¢, would not be with
the stigma of this charge resting upon
him. .
conveyed to the White House con
vinced the President that he was cer
tainly elected. To say that he was de
lighted Is but a mild expression of the
President's feelings. He did not hesi
tate to express to his family circle and
the Cabinet families .assembled about
him that he was surprised at the re
sult. Later on he "expressed"! Klm'self
as astounded at the size of his,,ma
jority. . â¢ :.-. ... . -
The President remained, in the pri
vate apartments of the White House
until nearly 10 o'clock and then went
over to the executive office, where he
received the Washington newspaper
correspondents. A delegation of the
Republicans of the District of Colum
bia, the Old Boys' Club and the Junior
Old Boys' Club serenaded him in front
of the executive, office. They ap
peared in uniform, bearing old-fash
ion Republican torchlights.
After receiving the congratulations
of. the newspaper correspondents the
President. invited them to his private
office, where he made this statement
for publication.
"I am deeply sensible of the honor
done me by the American people in
thus expressing their confidence in
what I have done and have tried to do.
I appreciate to the full the solemn
responsibility this i confidence imposes
upon me, and I shall do all that In my
power lies not to forfeit it. On March
4 next I shall have served three and a^
half years, and these three and a half
years constitute my first term. The
wise custom which limits the Presi
dent to two terms regards the sub
stance and not the form and under no
circumstances will I be a candidate
for another nomination." >

Chances in Sea LeveL
The phenomenon In the changes in
the level of the sea is one which is
well shown in the case of the Mediter
ranean. M. Ph. Negris. in a recent
brochure presented to the Academy of
Sciences, furnishes us interesting in
formation on this point, it being appar
ent that the sea has greatly increased
in depth as compared to ancient times.
Formerly a bridge 3000 feet long united
Leucade to the continent. To-day it
is submerged, but the foundations of
the work were . discovered eleven feat
beneath the surface. It may therefore
be concluded that since the construc
tion of the bridge the sea has risen at
this point over nine feet. At Itea,
in the bay of Amphlssa. there has been
observed a mole that ia also over nine
feet beneath the surface. At Rhenee
there has been found a completely sub
merged dock, evidently of Roman con
struction, the depth of the sea above
the dock at places being fully nine feet.
From all of these facts one may con
dude, that there has taken place an
important increase in the depth of the
sea since the Roman period, the Medi
terranean having risen at least nine
feet in about two thousand years. â New

tion in its history, many voters not
taking interest enough in the contest to
go to the polls, notwithstanding that
four were to be elected,
an event which usually arouses the
interest cf county voters to the highest
pitch. Returns from fifteen out of
twenty-one precincts give Roosevelt 17*
plurality and CMllett for Congress a
plurality of 252
LASSEX COUNTY.

Faith creates thÂ« future.
The universal rivalry in the oil trade
gradually ceases to affect East India,
because the Burmese petroleum indus
try; is so rapidly growing. The Imports
have decreased from 91.000,000 gallons
In 1901-2 to 71,000,000 grallons In 1903-4.
Prices and freight rates have been det
rimental to the American product,' the
imports of which have considerably de
creased, and which has now become an
article of luxury. Trade in Russian
petroleum is also decreasing, which is
partly due to the influx of Straits oil,
but chiefly to the increasing production
of Burmese petroleum, the consumption
of which has more than doubled within
two years, and in 1903-4. reached 40,
000.000 gallons out of . an approximate
total consumption of 110,000,000 gallons.

DEL X0ETE COUNTY.
SAN ANDREAS. Nov. 8.â Calavera*
County will go Republican by a very
big plurality. The Congressional con
test between Glllett and Caminettl will
be very close. Glllett is considered to
be the winner. McKenny (R.), candi
date for Assembly, will defeat Messen
ger (D.) by a large vote.
CALAVEKAS COUNTY.
OROVILLE, Nov. 8.â Twenty-nine
precincts out of fifty-four in Butte
County give Roosevelt 12S9 and Parker
807 votes. The precincts yet to be heard
from will give Roosevelt a greater plu
rality over Parker than McKinley
gained over Bryan four years ago.
The3e precincts give McKinlay (R.) for
Congress 1176 to Bell's 110S. Coombs
received a plurality of 264 over Bell in,
this county two years ago. W. F. Gates
(R.) is elected Assemblyman from the
Seventh District over Armstrong (D.)
by a large vote.
The following table of partial, returns from the counties of the' State
shows that there was a decided increase in the Republican vote. The vote
in the southland was particularly heavy: f
In the Supervisorial contests Patter
son (R.) is undoubtedly elected oevr
Moore (D.). The election of Wilson
(R.) over Bailey (D.) is still in doubt.
Wllgon ran 100 votes behind in one
precinct. Between Lauder (R.) and
Alexander (I.) the indications are in
favor of the success ..of Lauder, but
this is by no means certain, 1 * and the
complete returns may change the com
plexion of the news. :' r
The largest vote ever cast In Los
Angeles was polled. Fully 90 per cent
of the total registration was represent
ed and the registered vote was 50 per
cent greater than ever before. There
was no disorder at any of the precincts.
At midnight the returns Indicate that
Los Angeles County would give Roose
velt 20.000 plurality.
Carter has defeated Gould in the
Thirty-seventh Senatorial District, but
Carter ran behind the Presidential
ticket. In the contests in the various
Assembly districts the Republicans
won without an exception.
The expectation on the part of the
Democrats that J. Ross Clark and Eu
gene Germain, Democratic candidates
for electors, would receive a large com
plimentary vote was not realized. They
got no more than their fellows. De
spite the claims of the Democrats the
entire Republican legislative ticket ap
pears to have been successful. Out Po
mona way Broughton defeated Dillon
by a decisive vote, but not by any
thing like the plurality the Republican
national ticket received.
LOS AXGEL.ES Nov. 8.â Never be
fore in the history of California poll
tics has Los Angeles County given such
a majority to any ticket as .that which
to-day she gave to the whole Republi
can ticket. The prediction of the party
rranagement was that Roosevelt's plu
rality would be 15,000. It will be greater
than 20,000, and Indications are - that
the Republicans will elect not only the
entire legislative ticket, but the Super
visors as well, j There is doubt only as
to one Supervisorial district.
Everything points to a Republican
landslide, one which will give to Presi
dent Roosevelt a vote far in excess of
that ever, before givon here to any Re
publican nominee for any office.
Chairman Lee of the County Central
Committee, who through the campaign
has claimed that Roosevelt would re
ceive a plurality of 15,000 in the county,
now claims 18.00Q, and the returns so
far^as received seem to indicate that
his claim Is not an unreasonable one.
Split tickets were voted only for legis
lative and county offices nnd there was
practically no scratching of the elector
al tickets.

The telegrams announcing success of

who had conducted the campaign in a
highly creditable manner.
DEMOCRATS ABIDE BY RESTJMV
At Democratic headquarters despond
ency reigned. Chairman Timothy Spel
lacy was m Bakersfleld and Secretary
Thomas F. Walsh held down the dead
watch alone interrupted only by lone
stragglers, who strayed in to see if
there was any hope in sight. Mr. Walsh
was asked for a statement. He begged
to be excused until he could telephone
Bell. at Napa. that he was defeated for
Congress. Then he smiled a wan Â»mirÂ»
and there may have been tears in his
eyes as there were in his voice. "We
can't say anything," be said. "There is
really nothing to say." We were beaten
here and elsewhere and abide by the
result. The Jury called the American
people has spoken and we- can't go
behind the verdict." Some one drifted
in and queried in a soft voice. "How
did New York go?" Mr. Walsh caught
a deep breath off the top of a sigh;
then exploded. "Roosevelt by 260,000."
and sank back in his chair.

In speaking of the result In this

was exceedingly heavy in 'this city.
VENTURA, Nov. 8. â Ventura Coun-
County will give a plurality of about
5000 for Theodore Roosevelt. Four

rality of 375 for McKinley four years
ago. D. T. Perkins, the Bard condi
date- for the Assembly, will lead the
Presidential vote by several hundred,

the talk and claims of the supporters
of the other candidates early in the
day. Doubts as to the outcome, if .any
really existed, were first dispelled by
the returns from the forty . precincts
where voting machines were used.
These were In by 8 o'clock and
showed Kerrigan at the head of the
ticket with 8795 votes. Troutt 8037. Mu
rasky. 7943, Seawell 7375, Gallagher 6180,
Burchard 6136, Conlan 5507 and White
4080. It developed that White, one of
the Democratic candidates put forward
as against the candidacy of one of the
Republican incumbents, was more than
1400 behind his running mate, Charles
T. Conlan, who was drawing somewhat
from Troutfs non-partisan strength
and getting: the additional support of
the Police Court clientele. The two
non-incumbent Republicans, James L.
Gallagher and Daniel W. Burchard,
were running close together and within
their party vote, to indicate that they
would not be dangerous to the chances
of Murasky and Seawell.
"When the official return from all the
precincts came !n the incumbent Judges
were found re-elected by a splendid
majority. Judge James M. Troutt, who
polled the lowest vote of the four, was
almost 5000 votes ahead of James M.
Gallagher, who ran highest of the
other aspirants for the office.

SANTA ROSA. Nov. 8.â The outcome
of the election in Sonome County has
proved a great surprise to both Re

generally believed that Congressman

Special efforts were made by the Demo

ago they were confident of success.
Santa Rosa gave Bell 150 plurality, but
the outlying precincts overcame that
vote by returning 300 plurality for Mc-
Klnlay. Had the vote been the other
way, no one would have been surprised.
Roosevelt will carry the county by 2200
plurality and McKlnlay by about 250.

Pippy appeared at the Registrar's of
fice late in the afternoon and made
complaint It was to the effect that
he had registered on May 20 last, but
although an extra force of clerks were
put to work they were unable to trace
any record of the entry. The canceled
affidavit signed by Pippy two years ago
was found, but that did not help him
In . his emergency.
Election Commissioners Voorsanger,
McGuire, Lefflngwell and Devoto all
joined in the general search for Plppy's
name, but without success. No relief
could be afforded Pippy, as the Com
mission could not legally go behind the
records .and Pippy finally left the
Registrar's office decidedly angry at his
not being able to vote owing to a pos
sible clerical error. Pippy telephoned
Probably one of the most disappoint
ed men in the city yesterday was
Colonel George H. Pippy, Presidential
Elector and president of the Union
League Club, who was not permitted to
vote in the Seventeenth Precinct of the
Thirty-seventh Assembly District be
cause his name does not appear on the
register.
Similar complaints were filed by
George Flore, who claimed to- have

There were others besides Pippy who
were denied the exercise of their elec
tive franchise because their names did
not appear on the register, j Among
these wasNSrattan Phillips of the firm
of Phillips, Smyth & Van Orden.
Phillips claimed that he had registered
some time in January from the
Eleventh Precinct of -.the Forty-first
Assembly District, but his name could
riot be found on the register. A pe
culiar feature of the matter was . the
fact that Phillips says he voted at the
May primary. Election Commissioner
Voorsanger stated that if Phillips did
vote at jthe primary he did so illegally
through the incompetence of . the elec
tion officers. Phillips, like Pippy, lost
his vote.

which he said he had registered by his

Louis Metzger appeared at the Reg
istrar's office in the afternoon and stat
ed that the election officers In the Six
teenth Precinct of the Forty-fourth As
sembly District had refused to permit
his secretary to accompany him into
the voting booth to aid him in marking
his ticket, Metzger being blind. Metz
ger asserted. that at all previous elec
tions he had been allowed to vote in
the manner- Indicated. Election Com
missioners Devoto, Â¦ Roberts and Lef
nngwell informed Metzger that under
section 1208 of the political code he
was entitled only to the assistance of
Â¦ two officers of election of different
political parties after the latter had
signed affidlvats that they would not
give Information regarding the mark
ing of the ballot by Metzger. Metzger
was disinclined to submit to this con
dition and left the Registrar's office
with the intimation that he might not
vote at all.
RUMOR IS INCORRECT.
Six complaints were received before
10 o'clock that the election was not
being properly conducted in the Third
Precinct of the Thirty-sixth Assembly
District. Election Commissioner Lef
flngwell went to the booth and in
formed the election board that, if any
more complaints were made he would
remove the entire board and appoint
substitutes. No more complaints were
received after LefflngweH's threat.
Complaint .was filed at the Regis
trar's office that a sign announcing the
candidacy of Jeremiah Dillon for As
pemblyman of the Thirty-seventh Dis
trict had been nailed in front of 542
Halght street,, utilized for the polling
place of -the Fifth Precinct of the
Thirty-seventh District. Commissioner
Lefnngwell went to the booth and tore
down the sign, which was suspended
in violation of the election law.
When the polls closed at 5 o'clock
word was received at the Registrar's
office thatNhe machine in the Eighth
Precinct of the Thirty-sixth District
could not be unlocked and Caretaker
Ramsey straightened matters out at

Information was also. received that
the machine- In "the Sixth Precinct of

Commissioner Roberts went to" the
scene and found that the main lever
had not been pushed back far enough.

Election Commissioner -' McGuire
visited all the precincts of the Thirty
first. Thirty-seventh. Thirty^sixth. and
Fortieth Assembly districts," which
were supplied with voting machines,
and found them all working In fine
order. Word was received at the Reg
istrar's office at noon that when the
one hundred and fifth man attempted
to vote the Union Labor ticket the
machine in the Fifth Precinct of the
Thirty-first District, located at 441
Eleventh street, failed to work. An
expert was sent out and he found'that
the machinery had become clogged, in
some way and^the defect was^remedied

The Prohibition party displayed but
little strength. It cast but a few hun
dred votes in the city, and these were
widely scattered.
Â¦"' No city in the Union can claim great*
er pride, in the great result of yester
day's election than San Francisco,
which, up to the close of the count at
midnight gave the Republican electoral
ticket the splendid plurality, of. 15,863.
This plurality was out of a total count
of "49.077 vote's. When the count is
completed to-day the plurality of the
Republican party in San Francisco will
doubtless be much greater than these
figures show, and tho great county of
Ihe State will again be among the.bid
ders for the silken banner of the faith.
The figures supplied by the' Registrar
at midnight show that the Congres
sional candidates and the. entire Re
publican legislative' ticket of the city
districts were elected.- The incumbent
candidates for the Judiciaryâ Judges
Seawell, Troutt, Murasky and Kerri
gan â were re-elected, being carried into
office by ! a- splendid non-partisan vote
that speaks in fitting approval of their
administrations " "of ' their dignified
offices:: As heretofore the people re
'fused to hedge the Judiciary with
party lines, and the men who, through
the years of their incumbency, have
guarded without fear, or favor the
rights of all the people were rewarded
for their faithful service.
Only in the*, question of the ju
diciary, however, could the Republican
avalanche be stayed. Grievances of dis
tricts against the Republican organi
zation and efforts to defeat its legisla
tive candidates by strengthening the
Democratic candidates with Union La
bor nominees were without avail. In
the .Thirty-seventh Assembly District
F. ". C: Jone*. â¢Â¦â¢ Republican nominee for
the . Assembly, signally defeated J. H.
Dillon,"- ". whose ; nomination by the
DÂ«?mocraÂ£ic party was strengthened by
the presentation to the candidate of
the Union Labor nomination.
The Republicans who Jumped over
the traces In the Thirty-ninth Assem
bly District and put E. T. Murray in
the race as an independent candidate
for the Assembly have also faced the
bitterness of defeat. T. E. Atkinson
Rt publican nominee, was elected by a
comfortable majority and now the In
dependents find themselves clear out
of tfce field where political plums may
be picked when the Legislature meets.
Notwithstanding the sweeping vic
tory of the Republican party there was
one other party in the contest yester
day that cast a vote that is significant.
This party Is the Socialist. In the city
alone it polled over 5000 votes and If
it keeps" growing at the ratio that has
marked its progress since the last gen
eral election it will soon be a factor In
the game of ballots.

James Kenney entered the booth
about noon prepared to vote the Union
Labor ticket and when he could not

something was wrong. . Investigation
showed the cause of the difficulty and
the necessary repairs were made Im

in fact seemed glad of an opportunity
to show that they were willing to make
pood. During the busy hours of the
day they worked, industriously writing
down names, tearing off blanks and
taking surreptitious glances at their
watches. When the sunset gun boomed
Kt the Presidio there were deep sighs
of relief by the prominent citizens who
had finished their first experience as
election officers. All were game and
their laces were wreathed in smiles
during the performance of their duties.
Hundreds of curious persons were at
tracted to the booths to catch a
plimpse of representatives of the
wealth and business industry of San
Francisco toiling. Jokes made at their
expense by facetious voters were taken
in good part and replied to In the spirit
in which they were spoken.
On Valencia street, near Seventeenth,
in a stuffy little booth, with the sun
beating down on the roof and through
windows, sat ex-Mayor James D. Phe
lan, busily engaged, while the perspira
tion rolled down over a wilting collar.
Mr. Phelan admitted that this was his
first experience as an election officer,
and the silence that followed the state
ment implied that he hoped it was his
last. "Not that I object to serving,
he hastily added, "but I don't like to
deprive another man of a chance to
earn the $10." ' -*} <; ; ;.
Frank J. Symmes, president of the
Merchants' Association, sat in the close
quarters of a tailor shop in the Tenth
Precinct of the Twenty-eighth on Fol-
Botn street, near Third. Mr. Symmes
seemed to be thoroughly enjoying him
self, although he said that the day in
his precinct had been uneventful.
At The booth of the First Precinct.
Fortieth District, the first election offi
cer to arrive was M. H. de Young. Mr.
de Young was closely followed by Al
Castle of the well-known firm of Castle
Brothers. When the usual formalities
had been gone through with Mr. de
Young stepped inside the curtain*
screening the machine and cast the
first vote in the precinct.
In the Fifteenth Precinct of the For
ty-flrst two men well known in tn*
world of nnance sat behind desks and
wielded pens. They were I. W. Hell
man Jr.. well known in banking circles,
and Wakefleld Baker of the firm of
Baker & Hamilton. They seemed
pleased with the prospeots of earning
$10 working for the city. ' -'*w
T Cary Friedlander, secretary of the
Merchants* Exchange, busied himself
In the booth at Sutter and Franklin in
the Second Precinct of the Fortieth.
Â¦Mr Friedlander is accustomed to
swinging his pen over lists and figures
and made an admirable election officer.
Throughout the Western Addition
the day was very quiet. No challenges
were reported except for change of res
idence after the expiration of the time
limit. Machines were used in the ma
jority of the booths and few of the
voters experienced any difficulty in
managing them. The heaviest voting
was early in the morning and by noon
almost the entire vote had been^cast in
the district. .. *â¢
L. M. King, secretary of the Mer
chanu' Awodation, did his share of
work in Precinct 14 of the Forty-third
District and apparently was well
pleased with his job. At Post and
I^eavenworth streets, in the Tenth
Precinct of the Forty-third, Lippmann
Eachs showed what an efficient clerk
he could be, and J. D. Grant in the
Tenth Precinct of the -Forty-first
v, ielded his pen over the tally sheets.
The election In the Forty-first Dis
trict passed off Quietly. The voting
was done early In the day. In the
Eeventeenth Precinct the voting was
practically all over before noon. This
precinct is near the gates of. the Pre
sidio.
In the Thirteenth Precinct of the
Forty-flret District 193 votes were
polled out of a registration of 202.
The voting In the' Mission and Sunset
districts was conducted in an unusually \
quiet and orderly manner. The police
men on duty at the polling places de
clared that it was the quietest elec
tion they had ever known. The vote
from Tenth street to Ocean View was
the heaviest ever known. Where ma
chines were in use almost all the men
registered turned out to show their
political preferences. Some one is sup
posed to have attempted to thwart
those who wished to vote for the Labor
;andidates in precinct 5, district 31, by
shutting a part of the face of a ma
chine from view. The heavy screen
which hangs below the names of
parties and candidates was raised so as
to cover the Union Labor ticket. The
Eeal was then broken and affixed to
the machine again to correspond with
the change In the position of thÂ«
screen. 9K9B

WASHINGTON, Nov. 8. â Close
friends of Bryan delcare that his plans
for 190* are to control the radical and
seral-sociallstic sentiment 7 in the West
and in the East. The old alliance of
the South and West may not be re
newed. The South wiSTbe told that it
gained nothing by-breaking away from
its' former ally and joining with New
York.- At the same time Bryan never
has looked on the Southern States as
fruitful soil for propagating his popu-
Hstlc or radical ideas. His strength in
the West end Southwest will be greatly
increased by the overwhelming victory
of Roosevelt in New York.
If Bryan takes satisfaction in any
one thing it will be in the knowledge
that Judge . Parker, on a conservative
plitform." was worse beaten In the con
servative East than he himself was on
a free silver platform.
The Herald representatives, in In
diana, Illinois and , Wisconsin in the
West and in Connecticut and New Jer
sey in the East have been toJd that
the local leaders of the. Bryan Dem
ocracy were already lajing plans for
the , reorganization of the- party. . This
information also reached, the Herald
from Democratic .'.Representatives-., in
Congress, who had loyally supported
Â¦^ryan in his two campaigns. They
seemed to know in advance' what was
going to happen and a sort of free
masonry, appeared to have carried the
news through a half dozen States.

him that he cast his ballot in the

Bienfeld was free in. challenging the
Chinese - : and Duffield was sponsor - for
them. The watchman was bubbling
with good nature. The watcher was
outspoken in hot condemnation of vot
ing by Chinese: /

r.ow because we .have the advantage
you are kicking like a* sorehead. These
Chinese â¢ are entitled to vote accord

to make a kick. Their voting Is on the

Bienfeld , was stirred to challenging
the" Chinese, with? renewed vigor. But
altogether .he did 'not shut out more
than five votes. One of the- Chinese
proved to be an ex-convict. â¢ v

was to vote to -find the places where

"You will have to wait till that gen
tleman is through." explained the elec
tion officer, pointing to the legs of ; the

This may account in part for the
diversity of. feeling toward nature that
exists so unaccountably among men
and \ women of otherwise congenial
tastes. Unless a person fished with a
bent pin as a child he isn't likely to
become enthusiastic over the sport as
s. man. The woods may lure, but they
aren't likely to captivate unless the
devotee early learned the'r ways. The
taste for outdoor life may be culti
vated to some degree, but unless it
was developed in youth it is not apt to
prove robust.â Kansas City Star.

The special telegraphic service with
Eastern cities was as perfect as It was
possible to make It. No expenw was
spared to give the news "at the very
earliest possible moment Special tele

the big Eastern points, and the regular
staff of correspondents was largely
augmented for the occasion.
The local reports were handled at the
Registrar's office in the City Hall by
reporters of The Call staff. The news
was telegraphed to The Call office over
wires especially strung for the paper's
use. The public of this city has never
before received the election returns in
so rapid a manner.
At 3:30 o'clock In the afternoon a bul
letin was put up announcing that
Roosevelt would undoubtedly carry
New York. At 3:50 o'clock a second
bulletin appeared announcing that
Roosevelt was undoubtedly elected
President of the United States.
These were the first Intimations con
veyed to the local public of the result
of the national election. The news was
received with tremendous cheers. From
this on The Call kept the lead In ad
vising the people of the situation both
in the East and In California.
j At 6:20 p. m. bulletins were posted
announcing the election of Kahn and
Hayes. At 7 p. m. the election of Ker
rigan. Troutt. Murasky and Seawell
was announced. By this time a tre

The circular is signed by George P.
Locke, who formerly was chairman
of the Kansas Democratic State Exec

years in the employ of Hearst and. was
in charge of the Chicago headquarters
of one of the Hearst leagues and dur
ing the national convention In St.
Louis was In charge of the Hearst
headquarters in that city.
All of the others who are named as
officials of the anti-Parker Democrat
ic National Leasrue are known to have
had affiliations with Hearst.
They have also obtained a copy of
a circular letter emanating from the
anti-Parker Democratic League, the
officials of which were pronouncedly
in favor of the nomination of Hearst.
This letter was distributed broadcast
the latter part of last week from the
headquarters of the league in suite

party had been captured by the al

to elect a true Democrat in 1908.

They also are particularly incensed
over the announcement of Palliser.
chairman of the People's party, .that
"In a few days a conference will be
held between Watson, Bryan and
Hearst to form a new Democratic
party."

denouncing the treachery of Hearst,

how to scratch Parker and vote for

in pursuance of plans agreed upon by

after the St. Louis convention, a con
ference would be held in this ci y,
probably next week, looking to tie
formation of a new party on radl< al
lines. -
NEW YORK, Nov. 9.*â Hearst's N sw
York American says: I
-"Judge Parker is overwhelmingly
beaten. The reasons for his defeat are
perfectly plain. Judge Parker sim
ply failed to Inspire the earnest, gen
uinely Democratic elements of his own
party with confidence. They did ndt
feel that in voting for him they would
be voting for Democratic principles.
And he did not attract Republicans
who are tired of the reign of special
interests and are ready to come over
to the - Democracy when the Democ
racy has the courage to be Democratic.
.' "August Belmont and other promi
nent promoters of the Parker move
ment were in a position to know all
about the feelings of certain enor
mously rich and influential 'captains of
industry' and 'kings of finance' toward
Roosevelt. To their broad Intellects
it seemed that all that was necessary
for Democratic success was to present
a candidate whose sobriety of mind
and sedate demeanor would offer an
impressive contrast to the, noisy and
sv.-aggering President. Thus would the
support of the disturbed and Incensed
'business interests' be secured. - :
. Vis it surprising that the masses,
and others who do not class them
selves - with the masses, viewed the
sane, safe and conservative pro
gramme merely as an equally sincere
and. foolish endeavor to win the trusts
away from the Republican party and
to form a partnership between them
and- their neutral enemy, the Demo
cratic party? - - -
"The ballot demonstrates what con
struction the people put upon Judge
Parker's denunciation of trusts. It is
manifest that they attributed , his hos
tility to the trusts to the failure of
the trusts to be friendly to him; that
they read In his tardy anti-trust atti
tude a-comDlete breakdown- of the
'sane, safe Â¦* and conservative* pro
gramme, a bitter disappointment of
the expectation that the trusts /could
be coaxed awar from their allegiance
to the Republican party.
"Judge Parker lost because the real
Democracy refused to accept him as
a Democrat. Had J. P. Morgan gone
upon the stump for him it could not
have had a worse effect than the ob
trustive prominence of August Bel
mont and the speech-making of
Cleveland and OIney."

A physician puts the query: Hare
you never noticed In any large restau-
rant at lunch or dinner time .the larga
number of hearty, vigorous j old men
at the tables; men whose ages run
from 60 to 80 years; many of them bald
and all perhaps gray, but none cf them
feeble or senile?
Perhaps the spectacle Is so common
as to have escaped vour observation
or comment,- but nevertheless it is an
object lesson which means something. |
If vou will notice what these hearty
old fellows are eating you will ob-
serve that they are not munching bran
crackers nor gingerly picking their way
through a menu card of new fancied
health foods; on the contrary, they
seem to prefer a Julcv roast of beÂ«f, a
properly turned loin of mutton and
even the deadly broiled lobster Is not
altogether Ignored..
The point of all this is that a rig-
orous, old age depends upon good di-
gestion and plenty of wholesome food
and not upon dieting and an endeavor
to live upon bran crackers.
There is a certain class of food
cranks who seem to believe that meat,
coffee and many other good things are
rank poisons, but these cadaverous,
sickly looking Individuals are a walk-
in? condemnation of their own theo-
rle?.
The matter in a nutshell is that If
the stoma'ch secretes the natural di-
gestive Juices in sufficient quantity any
wholesome food will be promptlv di-
gested; -If the stomach does not do
so and certain foods cause distress one

!and eating as they have to. at all

tag public for years have pinned their
faith to Stuart's Tablets.
"All druggists sell them at 50 cents

LIFE'S STORY.
"that the business of transportation by rail has grown to the magni
tude of a quasi-public function. Indeed, in some other countries
it is discharged by the public itself. But since in America the service
i:- confined to private corporations,, operated primarily for profit to
themselves the public has a right to require that this service shall
be performed with dV.e regard for the safety of life and limb, this
without reference to or any special regard for the corporation's profits
ir particular instances."
If the somewhat melancholy conclusion must be drawn that the
railroads must be forced by the weight of public opinion into a more
scrupulous regard for the safety of those whom they serve, the time
for an expression of that opinion is ripe. Those whose employment
or whose circumstances lead to the constant use of railroads are
wont to become hardened to the element of risk entailed and to count
it along with the permanent liabilities of their lives. This should
not be. If we are to travel on the rails with reasonable certainty of
immunity from death or maiming, we should make known our desire
in no uncertain manner. The railroads offer commodities in exchange
for money and arc not exempt from the laws of trade. Insistent de
mand for a safer service must be met by compliance.
It is admitted on all hands." says Lynde in his current article,
WHEN the Interstate Commerce Commission begins to collect
its data on railroad fatalities for the year 1904 the grisly
record of lives snuffed out and permanent injuries dealt broad
cast to travelers will be nothing less than appalling. The commis
sion's report for last year included the tale of something over 100,000
casualties on American steam roads, but now when editors of big
daily papers have to reckon almost nightly on so much "space" de
voted to disasters on the rail, evidences point to a roll of death for
the present year that will exceed that of the last. Over 100 lives
lost at Eden, Colo., seventy killed in a smashup in Tennessee, scores
crushed on a picnic train in Xew Jersey â these will be some of the
largest items in the forthcoming statistics.
Some of the papers of Great Britain have been calling editorial
notice to what they style "the brutal indifference" of the American
public to the continuous record of accidents on the rails. They point
out the fact that for our hundreds killed in the past year by railroad
wrecks, the records of their railroads have but six deaths in the
fame period tallied up against them. To offset the fact of our
vastly greater extent of mileage the English critics point to the
intense congestion of traffic ' in their land, where one is rarely
out of hearing of a railroad whistle. The imputation is broad
ly drawn, consequently, that the traveling public on this side of the
water shares with the management of the roads in a supreme indif
ference to precautionary measures against the possibility of disaster.
Certain it is that with the rapid strides taken by invention in
rtcent years whereby mechanical contrivances in the rolling stock
and the rails themselves have had the tendency to reduce the causes
of fatal accidents attributable to human failings, the death rate
should be lowered instead of increased at the present terrible rate.
In the early days of railroading, when every sacrifice was made in
the endeavor to reach out and cover new fields of enterprise and
when the human agency was relied upon almost altogether to insure
the safety of passengers, accidents, some of them serious ones, were
of frequent occurrence. To-day we have improved roadbeds, steel
trestles instead of wooden, heavier trucks on the engines and cars, air
brakes and patent couplers and automatic blocks at the switches, yet
the tale of disaster grows.
Arc American railroad managers incompetent to solve the
problem, or does the question of dividends have weight with their
conduct of affairs? In a series of articles appearing in the Reader
Magazine recently. Francis Lyride,. who speaks . with the au
thority of experience, declares that in too many instances the desire
to have a clean sheet and prompt dividends to present to stockholders
leads those in charge of raiiroad operation to practice "economy'' all
along the line. Employes are given longer hours, machine shop
forces arc cut down, oid engines are spruced up with makeshifts in
stead 01 being replaced by new ones, a supreme confidence is placed
in "luck" in every department of operation â then a blow falls some-

"I never thought that I would be se
lected. I knew Professor Mathews had
sent my name and a note to the Mayor,
They now all indorse the selection
of the Mayor, who. although he* has
never seen Miss Scott, is convinced
from Professor Mathews' representa
tion that she possesses beauty of no or
dinary type.-
Miss Scott is a dainty young wom
an. She is rather slender, being 5 feet
G inches In height and weighing only
118 pounds. She is neither a blonde nor
a brunette.. her hair being light brown.
Her nose Is short and retrousse, '"tip
tiUel Mke the petal of a rose." She has
a bright smile, a merry laugh and a
musical voice.
"Chicago ran put jj forth the ideal
type of beauty." Miss Amelia Bingham
declared when shown a photograph ot
Miss Scott.
"The best thing the Mayor coald
have done was to select a girl who is
neither a. blonde nor a brunette," de
clared Director French of the Art In
stitute. "Chicago is so cosmopolitan it
has no distinctive type, and conse
quently a compromise is the only
choice." .
and we often lau'ghed about it. 'But
I thought the Mayor would select some
girl who has won a name for herself
in society or as a local beauty.
"Now understand, my acceptance of
the honor tendered me does not indi
cate that I fully agree with the Mayor
in his choice/ of beauty. I was never
discovered before and have not been
famous long" enough to accept it as
true myself.
"I do not think for a moment that I
am the prettiest girl in Chicago, but I
shall pose as the "typical girl' as well
as my natural gifts will permit."
â¢ That others Indorse the Mayor's se
lection of Miss Scott is shown by the
following statements from eminent
Judges:
RECORD OF RAIL DISASTERS.
The Board of Aldermen and a spe
cial committee consisting of Ruther
ford McCormick. son of the Embassa
dor to Russia; Major Foreman. of Gov
ernor Yates' staff of â¢. colonels, and
John Brfnnan wrestled with the prob
lem of picking out Chicago's official
beauty for two months. After exam
ining hundreds of photographs they
were unable to agree, and it was then
that Professor Mathews came to the
rescue of the city.
Professor Mathews has never before
posed as a connoisseur of beauty. In
the past he has devoted himself entire
ly to teaching biblical history and this
has led some of Miss Scott's rivals to
assert that maybe somewhere in an
cient history there is a style of beauty
that justifies her selection.
"Them fellies down at that Standard
Oil University will make this town
rediculous," declared "Bathhouse John"
when he, heard who had assisted the
Mayor in his selection. "Why, they
never see a real live beauty."
â¢ Miss Scott in no wise resembles the
girthy. helmeted "I will!" girl which
sculptors made to represent Chicago.
Miss Scott was born in Kansas, and
has a complexion as fresh and clear as
the breezes of the Western prairies.
"She's a pretty girl, and I don't care
whether her beauty is classical or not,"
Mayor Harrison said. "She's a typical
Chicago girl and will reflect credit on
herself and the city."
After the Beau Brummels of the Al
dermanlc Board had puzzled for two
months in trying to select a typical
beauty. Professor Shailer Mathews of
the divinity school of the Chicago Uni
versity suggested Miss Grace Scott,
his private secretary. She is the clerk
to the divinity school, and even her
enemies admit she is pretty; but some
contend that her beauty is not
classical.
Mayor Harrison, with rare judgment,
Miss Scott's friends say, and with poor
Judgment, her rivals contend, selected
her as the official Chicago Girl for the
beauties representing sixteen cities at
the exposition.
ogy and New Testament history
was shown by his recommendation
that Miss Grace B. Scott represent the
city of Chicago on the Oklahoma City
day at the St. Louis Exposition, says
the New York World.
THAT the dean of thev divinity
school of the University of
Chicago knows as much about
beauty as he does about theol-
Nothing that occurred during the campaign was sufficient to
change in any way the first convictions of the people. The Demo
cratic faction that was defeated at St. Louis may endeavor to even up
matters now by asserting that if it had been successful it would have
framed a platform, named a ticket and conducted a campaign that
would have carried Democracy to victory. Such assertions, how
ever, will be the offspring of factional spite rather than of reason. No
man nominated by the Democratic party could have won in this cam
paign. It is doubtful indeed whether any other candidate could have
made as good an impression upon the country as Judge Parker or
would have received as large a vote.
The plain truth is that the great mass of the people are well
satisfied with the results of Republican legislative policies, and are
proud of the type of Americanism represented so forcibly and so
brilliantly by Theodore Roosevelt. With even a weaker candidate
en the Republican ticket the conservative elements of the people
would still have voted for the party that stands for protection and
sound money; while it is equally certain that had the business in
terests of the country been undergoing a period of adversity instead
cf one of prosperity a majority of the people would still have voted
for Roosevelt upon the score of his superiority to his competitor in
even' element desirable in the personality of a President of the
United States.
As the issue presented, itself there was nothing in the campaign
to give cause for doubt in any quarter. The right candidate stood
upon the right platform and was supported by the right party. The
opposition presented an emergency candidate on a meaningless plat
form, supported by a discordant combination of recalcitrant factions.
With a sane people to decide between the two the result could not
be doubtful, and it was not. The foregone conclusion is announced
in the dispatches this morning. The American people "stand pat."
THE news published this morning of 'the results of the Presi
dential election will cause no surprise in any part of the country.
Even before the time for holding the national conventions it was
recognized that the nomination of Roosevelt by the Republicans was
inevitable, and that the triumph of his electoral ticket in the popular
contest was about as certain as anv future event could be.

national headquarters was a scene of
rejoicing to-night. The rooms, which
have been occupied by the committee,
were opened to a number of specially
invited guests. The communicating
rcoms were thrown open, making a
long corridor from Chairman Cortel

result of the election was known.
Chairman Cortelyou was delayed on
Long Island. He went to Hempstead
at noon to vote and did not return
until 7 o'clock. Just before 3 o'clock
he went to the national headquarters
and soon afterward issued a statement
saying: /
"At this hour the indications are
that the country has given an over

President and his administration."
Many personal friends of the Presi

Ten years ago Mr. Morse married
Ida McXinley. niece of President Mc-
Kinley. and daughter of David McKin
ley. The widow and one daughter sur
vive him. The parents of Mr- Morse
are still living. His brother. Lieuten
ant Joseph Morse, was killed in the
Philippines during the Spanish-Amer
ican war. Arrangements for the funeral
have not yet been made.
George E. Morse was 34 years of age
and a native of this city. He gradu
ated from the public schools and was
first employed by Huntingdon, Hopkins
& Co. Later he resigned and was em
ployed by the J. D. Spreckels & Bros.'
Co.. remaining with that firm for sev
eral years. Shortly after the first elec
tion of McKinley to the Presidency
Judge de Haven appointed Morse clerk
of the district court. His ability was
at once recognized by his associates
and his genial manner won him the
friendship of all In the Appraiser's
building and all who came into his
office to transact business.
GeorgÂ« EL Morse, who for almost
eight years has been the efficient and
popular cterk of the United States Dis
trict Court, died at his residence, 2090
Fell street, last night after a brief ill
ness. The news of his death will come
as a shock to his host of friends in this
city, many of whom did not even know
of his Illness. Three weeks ago he was
stricken with typhoid pneumonia, and
despite the efforts of his physicians
and careful nursing he succumbed to
the dread disease.

Mary K. Taylor, one of the clever
est leading actresses in the East, will
play the role of the heroine, Mabel
Wilson, in the successful melodrama.
"The Fatal Wedding," which begins a
run of a week next Sunday matinee at
the Grand Opera-house. Miss Taylor
has scored an Immense success In this
role, of which she was the creator four
seasons ago. "The Fatal Wedding",
takes its title from the last act of the
play, which shows the interior of
Grace Church, >*ew York, illuminated
at night while a wedding is in pro
gress. The adventuress Is shot to
death at the steps of the altar as she
is about to utter the words that would
have wrecked the life of the man she
was about to marry. Probably no
melodrama produced in the last decade
has achieved a greater success than
"The Fatal Wedding." It has not only
been played throughout the British
empire, but has also been produced in
the German and the French languages
on the European Continent, where it Is
still running.

Queen Alexandra Fancies Cats.
It is well known that Queen Alex
andra, England's well-beloved Queen,
is an expert dog fancier, but that she
is. also a cat fancier, has not been at
all well known until very recently. In
fact, the special liking for cats that
her Majesty ..'has lately displayed
threatens to supplant entirely her
fancy, for blue ribbon dogs.
She found that her dog breeding was
so widely known and so generally
copied thaf she decided to drop that
and go in for raising tabbies. In pur
suance of her /policy of thoroughness.
Queen Alexandra at once secured a
small army. of the best breeds. These
cats are much in evidence at Bucking
ham. To friends-desirous of possessing
a cat of exalted pedigree the Queen is
most . generous, giving freely of her
host of felines.
Six cats are the favorites of the
Queen; one, Sandy â so named because
vborn at Sandrlnghamâ a valuable Per
sian, being the particular favorite, and
traveling as constantly with his mis
press for the past several months as
ever the King's celebrated Irish terrier
Jack did. "the feline proteges of Alex
andra find no favor in the sight of Ed
ward VII, for he cordially detests all
of them.â Illustrated Sporting News.

as follows: "Spending money while out

VISITORS AT THE FAIR.
At 5:25 the counts was completed, then
the talliers checked. back to make sure
that there had been no mistake. In
five minutes this was done and the
election officers were busy filling out
their books, while four husky men took
the machine down' from its. spindle
le'gs. wrapped the green curtains about
It and stored It in its box.
At 5:13 o'clock the officials were
ready for the cour.t. While Inspector
J. Hauser scrutinized the returns a
Hayes supporter stepped forward and
said, "Wynn 165. Hayes 232," and rush<
ed out. Under the old system he would
have been y hours ;in getting this re
pult. Then the official count began.
Mr. Hauser called off the totals and
the clerks at the tally sheets repeated
back to him. In calling the votes on
the amendments he had reached the
twelfth, going across the machine,
when one of the talliers cried "Hold on!
There are only seven amendments."
That was true, but there were four, or
five votes for' more; no telling from
where they came. .
; A sarnple^of the way in which the
mechanical cabinet was Introduced to
the voters of this city as a cold storage
for Apolitical preferences was witnessed
in Precincts .1 and 5, Tnirty
seventh District. During the day 459
citizens dallied with the pointers and
cranks. Some who voted the ticket
straight did the, trick in ten seconds.
Some took a whole minute . to pick
their. v favorites and a very few had
time called on them at the end of
two minutes. Once the crank or. lever
was not pulled quite far enough and
operations were suspended for twenty
minutes until a machinist could be sent
for at the Registrar's office.-, Â¦
At 5 o'clock the doors of the booth
were locked and there were a score of
curious persons and; two policemen at
the elbows of the election officers. For
a few minutes it seemed that the ma
chine would have' to be broken open
with an ax to get at the secrets re
posing in its mechanism, or else help
would have to be called from the Reg
istrar's office.
A voung man, Julius Levy, under
took to operate' the keys. He didn't
know that the machine Is as peculiar
as a combination safe. After five min
utes of mistakes he opened the doors
which protect a series. of bright metal
strips, numbered and lettered to cor
respond with- the front of the machine
and the tally sheets. Beside each
strip were three little holes, like rats'
eyes, and from them peeked the nu
merals which told the story of the
election In that particular booth.
Forty Standard voting machines were
used in yesterday's election in San

satisfied that the day of the paper
ballot and rubber stamp is soon to be
a thing of the past.

CALIFORNIA CLUB COURTS
I have carefully examined the . plans '.and
specifications for the wooden bleachers and
roofs now being built upon California field for
the athletic Interests of the. University of Cali
fornia at Berkeley, Cal. " I have also, in de
tail, examined the work in the field.
As a result of my calculations and examina
tions I -am able to state that the construction
In thoroughly safe and- excellent In design. In
fact. In my opinion, the bleachers and roofs
are of the best of their type -that' have come to
my notice in this country. : - .. ;
Heitmuller iand Force are sure of
their places on the team, and each will
be a tower of strength. There are
plenty of backs from which to make up
the offensive adjunct of the team, but
it is not likely the line-up in this
respect s will be decided upon earlier
than twelve hours before the game.
There are Sperry, White, Boynton,
Kern, Graves, Lasater and- Mead to
choose from, and all are being given
the polishing off that should fit all or
any of them to make the team, and
give it strength. Booth will probably
get a quarter back's place,' though
Whitman and Belknap are possibilities,
and strong ones at that.
The men are being given secret
signal practice daily, and this will be
continued until Saturday.-
The bleachers on California field have
been examined by Charles Dorloth Jr.,
associate .professor of structural en
gineering at the university, and his re
port is as follows:

that are ominously like measles signs.

This was the rule except in one case,
James Haggerty, who has been draw
ing eharp steam for many years in the
vicinity of Fourth and Clementina
streets, martyred himself. The pitiful
pleadings of the suffering moved him
to open a keg. The opening closed his
career as cuencher of thirst. A blue
coated minion of election day prohibi
tion seized him. Curtains for Hagger
ty. The offense of dispensing the stuff
that cheers .on election day was
charged against him. '
But -those who knew did not suffer.
On Monday night they secured the
"morning's morning" drinks In 'ad
vance. While the forgetful looked
solemn they pursued the even tenor of
their ways and whistled gleefully as
thpy heard the wails of the thirsty. â¢
South of the *slot even the water
troughs ran dry. A pathetic specimen
of humanity collapsed In front of the
Mint. Policeman Culllnan rushed, to
the rescue. "Get him a drink," cried
the bluecoat. A glass was touched to
the victim's lips. A smile spread over
his countenance then vanished. "If
water Is the best a dying -man gets,"
murmured the stricken one, "what's
the use of dying?"
"Bill," pleaded the victim of the cot
ton-coated tongue. "I have known you
for years. We were kids together.
Kick in, Bill, for here's your chance to
3ave a life."... . *â¢-...
Thirst, awful thirst, reigned supreme
and inexorable in the city for eleven
hours yesterday. The swinging portals
that engulf the weary pilgrim refused
to respond, and hard raps upon the
back doors availed not. "Nothing do
ing" was the . watchword, and it went.
The mandate went out from all the
emporiums on the preceding eve, "Dan
ger is near thee. so beware! beware!"
But the wise ones who converse in
ninks heeded not the warning. They
knew where they could get the precious
fluid. "Leave it to me," they said. But
oh, what a difference in the morning.
"You know mine, Bill," gayly war
bled^ J. Wise. "The booths are open,"
replfed the "man . behind.". -
"Bill, cut this rough work out,"
cried J. Wise Esquire, in alarm.
"Nothing doing," replied the mixolog-
Isti Then it would get to the critical
stage.

Seattle walloped them yesterday till
the score stood 12 to 3. , : - "
The Si\\ ashes started in during the
first ifningr and hammered three
through. The Seals had a little come
lÂ»ack in the next round and managed
in i-et two. They were landing on Mr.
Hogg some and he was finally taken
out and replaced by Shields. Whsn
the southpaw got working there was
nothing to it. He had good control and
pitched steady ball in every round,
vhile Barber was easy.
The v. hole San Francisco team plaj-ed
doj>ey bail on the bases as well as
in the field. They had a good chance
to do something in the second round
uhrn a rally was started, but Barber
was c&Ught off third bass and that
ended it all. The Siwashes broke it

LATONIA SELECTIONS.
Stanford's second team is a remarka
bly good one this season and some of
the players are crowding the varsity
men for their positions. The greatest
fight in years is going on for the
place at right end. There are four can
didates out and no one, not even the
coaches, knows which one of them will
fill the position. Smith, last year's
end, has the lead in the race, but
West, sub-end on last year's freshman
team; Preston, who was varsity sub
stitute on the 1901 intercollegiate team,
and Stanford, who has played on the
second team for three years, .are so
close up that Smith may lose his place
at any time. To-morrow night's prac
tice will tell the tale and Lanagan will
pick his team then, although he will
not announce the names of the players
until Friday morning.
The yelling and singing of the Car
dinal rooters this year is a disappoint
ment and will not. equal that shown in
former games. The reason for this is
not the, inefficiency of the yell leaders
nor the lack of clever songs and slo
gans, but the unwarranted feeling of
happy confidence which pervades the
bleachers is the cause of the bad root
ing. The last rally of the year will
ttke place to-morrow night and at
that jolly-up the yell leaders will en
deavor to get this year's .rooting up to
the standard set in former seasons.
STANFORD UNiyERSITY, Nov. 8.â
Coach Lanagan seems satisfied with
the work his proteges are doing in se
cret practice this week. He looked
happy to-night for the first time since
the Utah game. To-day's practice was
fast and furious, the varsity lining up
against the second team for thirty
minutes of the hardest kind of scrim
mage work. No one was hurt and the
signals went off well, hence the head
coach's smile.

Strong in Practice.

Condition of the trackâ Fast.
This second batch of gloom was sent
flying, however, when Coach '.Hopper's
pets defeated Nevada last Saturday in
a fast, exciting and well played game.
Hopper was pleased, and the univer
sity's spirits went up to a bulb-break
ing point on. the thermometer.
With that showing still on the slate,
along came the measles microbe last
Saturday night, attacking three of the
varsity team's strongest men, and
making it a guessing contest whether
Snedigar, Stern Â¦and Howard will be
able to get into the game next Satur
day. . \
At this time nothing definite can be
announced about the appearance of
these men in the game, C oac h Hopper
saying - that probably they will play,
though even so wise and experienced a
football, general as he cannot venture
a guess as to what the men's condition
will be, in event of their taking part in
the struggle with Stanford.
Kerr took Stern's place at right
guard last night and this evening dur
ing practice, and Kittrelle was used in
Howard's stead. Snedigar has re
mained in evidence, refusing to admit
that the .measles have made him ca-
They are full of hope, however.
First of the clouds that darkened the
football horizon was the illness of Cap
tarh Ben Stroud, two weeks ago, neces
sitating his retirement from the team
for a few days and threatening to take
him completely out of the big intercol
legiate game. Â¦
Gloom settled down on the campus
and was not dissipated until Stroud
emerged from the hospital after a four
days' stay, sound and in fine fettle.
Then California's stock was at par. The
coaches encouraged the "rooters" and
the rooters Â«*1couraged the great plain
crowd of California adherents to be
lieve all was lovely in the football horo
scope, as far as > California's prospects
were concerned.
There-- followed, however, in a few
days, a- hint that the. team had put on
so fine an edge that the men were
stale, overdrawn, and that things again
looked squally for California. The
varsity players made an indifferent
showing against the fast Pomona
eleven, and did not shine with extraor
dinary brilliancy against Oregon or
Multnomah.
BERKELEY, Nov. 8.â All the glor
ious uncertainties of the gridiron game
seem 'illustrated in the experiences
which the t blue and gold football
team has had during the last two
weeks. Hope, and confidence have al
ternated with fear and trembling, until
to-day, with the great contest/ which
the "California eleven is to have with
the cardinal next Saturday, only four
days away, football enthusiasts who
ordinarily have reliable and accurate
"dope" on the varsity's condition and
prospects have to confess themselves
at sea.

ous witnesses, one being Mr. Butler, well-
known S. F. CHRONICLE representative.

mere BAGATELLE; nearly every case "be-
gins" to hear ."whispered" words after 3 sec-
onds' treatment. (Deaf mutes the same.)
"OSSIFIED""~LADYTMr9. Knowles, 379 Bart-

At the meeting of the Police Commis
sloners to-night Chief Wittman will
call- their attention to the building on
Jackson street, near Kearriy, that was:
known as the "Old Palace Hotel" ana I
ask .. for instructions. It is reported !
that the 'building, will be ready for oc
cupation next- Saturday, hence the
need of prompt action.
The building e has been entirely re
modeled.' There are four stories and
each story . has been subdivided into
small rooms, making a total, it is said,
of 175. It is alleged that the place will
be run on the same principle as the no
torious Hotel Nymphia on Pacific street
which- was closed about two years ago.
There is a mystery about the names of
the; lessees of the building. One man
known) as a . "dummy" has been . su
perintending â¢ the alterations.. but he is
secretive as to the names of his princi
pals. It is considered, likely that the
Police Commissioners will inspect 'the
place ' : before Saturday. " . Â¦â'

Reservists ' Flocking to Defense of
Country's Flag.
Special Cable to Ths Call and New York
â¢Herald. Copyright, 1904, by the New York
Herald Publishing Company.
ST. PETERSBURG, Nov. 8.âRus
sia's struggle to mass a sufficient num
ber of troops under, Kuropatkin's chief
command' to roll back Oyama's armies
is unprecedented In the history of the
country. Reservists are moving
toward various centers of mobilization
from every populated district west of
the Urals. Ordinary truck cars have
bi en converted into ."" double-decked
carriages, in which young soldiers are
packed like sardines In a can, with ra
tions condensed and scanty, although
adequate for the absolute needs of the
men. Quantities of food, are brought
to the railway stations, but none of it
can be taken along.
Women and \ehildren who accom
pany their husbands and fathers to the.
trains are frequently unable *to find
shelter while waiting their departure.
They haunt the stations, streets and
public squares ;and would starve were
It not for the efforts of private charity.
The: general staff Is aware that pre
liminaries for an epoch-making battle
are- well advanced at Mukden. â¢ It
knows that, thanks to the great ability
of Prince Khilkoff. the Russian forces
havelbeen strongly reinforced. It also
knows that . every day. is adding
strength to the enemy and that Oyama
is fortifying a semi-circle of strategical
positions, blocking the best roads to
the south and building up. behind these
positions bases of ; supplies secondary
only to, the main continental bases of
the Japanese at Dalny, Newchwang
and.Llaoyang. : .^" Â¦ '
.- This action is thought to; prove 1 that
Oyama is \ planning to launch < his
columns north and to bring as much
of;. Manchuria : within the Japanese
lines Â¦ as possible at the next blow in
order to facilitate ' the " Mikado's efforts
to; obtain , foreign loans,;;. which.' the
Russians assert, .have .now" become a
crying necessity at Tokio. This mass
ing, of the opposing forces foreshadows
not .only the greatest battle of this
campaign, I but also the most "feigantlc
test of strategy/ tactics and tropps of
modern times. ; . . -S.

I CRIPPLE CREEK, Colo.. Nov. 8.â
Three "men were shot in this district
to-day as a result of election quarrels.
One of them is dead, another mortally
I wounded and the third seriously in
! Jured. The dead man Is Christopher
j Miller, a former Alderman" of Goldfleld,
' and a deputy sheriff under Sheriff Rob-
I ertson prior to that official's forced
i resignation after the Independence ex
1 plosion and Victor riot. Miller was shot
j while sitting on a fence in front of a
i Goldfleld polling booth. Isaac Lebo, ti
j friend of Miller, who was also sitting
' on the fence, was shot In the shoulder
; a second later. He may die at any
I minute. Lebo claims that James War
ford shot him.- Miller, just before he
died, said that Thomas Brown fired the
bullet which caused his death. Some
spectators say that Warford fired both
shots.
' Brown and .Warford are deputy sher
iffs. They ordered Miller and Lebo,
who had been appointed election con
stables, to move on and remain outside
of the 100-foot limit: Miller refused to
! obey the order and, It is said, made a
motion as if to draw his revolver. The
officers also claim that Lebo started to
draw a revolver before he was shot.
: Miller and Lebo were members of the
Western Federation of Miners. Miller
i was deported last June, but recently
; returned.
I Edward Doyle, a Republican deputy,
was shot in the groin by Constable
I O'Leary after he had assaulted Mrs.
! Kennedy, a Democratic Judge of elec
: tlon, and had attempted to shoot the
constable who Interfered.
j Warford and O'Leary are under ar
1 rest. Mrs. Kennedy was also arrested
this afternoon upon an order from
Sheriff Bell, who charged her with
i creating a disturbance. She was sub
Â¦ sequently released, but was not per
! mined to serve longer as judge.
CHEFU, Nov. 8.â The Japanese are
ignoring General Stoessel and have
offered terms of surrender to ,the Rus
sian soldiers at Port Arthur,* accoTd
ing to advices which left Dalny yester
day and reached Chefu to-day. Mean
while, the ceaseless activity of the Jap
anese with picks and spades and the
gradual advancement of the Japanese
intrenchments spell inexorable fate to
the watching Russians.
A Russian, prisoner, who was cap
tured on October 26, said that the Rus
sian soldiers were In want and had be
come dispirited, as they saw the hope
lessness of the struggle. They had, he
said, given up all hope of relief either
from General Kuropatkin or the sec
ond Pacific spuadron.-Food was scarce,
hospital supplies were insufficient, a
Japanese victory seemed inevitaiWe and
the Russian soldiers, according to the
prisoner, could see no reason why they
should prolong a resistance which
would bring glory to their officers, but
chiefly hardship and death to them.
WRITES TO SOLDIERS.
Upon hearing this prisoner's story,
General Nogi called the members of his
staff together and briefly discussed the
situation with them. Then, under the
light of a bicycle lantern, General Nogi
drafted a letter to be circulated among
the soldiers themselves, the prisoner
having promised to deliver it in mercy
to his comrades.
This letter related the details of Gen
eral Kuropatkin's retreats and his In
ability to make any impression on the
forces of Field Marshal Oyama, to say
nothing of his inability to break
through the Japanese lines far the pur
pose of relieving Port Arthur. It told
how the Russian second Pacific squad
ron had only just started on a slow
voyage to the Orient.
Continuing, General Nogi's letter
called attention to the resistless ad
vance of the Japanese trenches toward
the fortress, thus making it only a
matter of weeks when the Japanese
would be able to walk into the main
Russian strongholds. In conclusion
the letter offered humane treatment to
all who would surrender, saying it
would be in the Interests of humanity
to prevent further useless slaughter.
. DELIVERS XOGl'S LETTER.
Early on" the morning of November
4, while darkness prevailed, several
copies of General Nogi's letter, written
In Russian, were given to the prisoner,
who gained the Russian lines without
being observed by his officers. On the
night of the fourth the Russian re
turned to -the Japanese lines and said
his comrades would answer the letter
within a few days. He said that the
temper of the soldiers with whom he
had communicated seemed to show
that while they felt mutinous when
considering their prospective fate, they
did not like the idea of an unofficial
surrender.
The letter, however, did much to dis
pel the impression fostered by the Rus
sian officers that a massacre would fol
low a Japanese victory.
The compaoy to which the prisoner
belonged originally numbered 1800, but
it is now composed of only thirty men,
according to the prisoner.
As the Japanese are sufficiently near
the summits to render tunneling highly
practicable, much of this work Is now
being done. The Russians are build
ing counter tunnels. Whichever side
finds , it? tunnel under that of the
other," blows up the letter's.
For the purpose of preventing ex
plosives being rolled down into their?
trenches, the Japanese have made
ranges out of hillocks of earth above
the trenches.
Five Russian mine-sweeping steam
ers have been sunk by Japanese shells.

Victims Were Members of

SAN RAFAEL, Hov. 8. â Fred Car
roll, once the king of baseball catch
ers and a member of the Morris-Car
roll battery, the greatest diamond duo
of the time, died suddenly at his home
in this city of heart disease last night.
Carroll has resided in this city since
he quit the diamond fifteen years
ago. He was one of the most popular
men in the town.
FrÂ«d Carroll was a sandlot player of
San Francisco and played his first pro
fessional game with the great Haverly
team in 1881. Ed Morris, the world
renowned, gouthpaw, was discovered at
the same time and after setting the
town wild with their work here the
pair went to Pittsburgh where they
reigned as the kings of the green dia
mond till "King" Kelly and John
Clarkson began their eventful careers.
Carroll and Morris toured the world
with the famous All-American team.
When their race had been run the pair
settled down to private life. Carroll
played with San Francisco for a while
in 1894, but finally gave up baseball
and went into business at San Rafael,
while Morris opened a saloon m Pitts
burg. Carroll was 40 years old and
leaves a wife and three children.-

A Japanese Prince, blood relation of
the sun, full flowered as a chrysanthe
mum and shrouded in the impenetrable
Eastern exclusivenees befitting one of
a race that has had a throne in the
family for ages, is approaching the Oc
cident. He is due here to-day on the
steamer Manchuria. If some Russianâ
if the Lena could only get her guns
out of pawn at Mare Island and sail
out en the ocean and overhaul the
M&nchuria before she crosses the
boundary lireâ brave Captain Berlin
eky would take a prize that would
win him everlasting fame.
The distinguished traveler from Nip
pon, who comes hither with staff offi
cers and secretaries, is Prince Fushimi,
cousin of the Mikado, a general in the
army, a statesman, a special envoy
and a samurai of hiph degree. A
ctntury back he would have been
standing on four little blocks of wood.
a rainbow tinted kimona around him
and two swords in bis girdle with
which he would execute an offending
Jap or himself on the slightest provo
cation. Now he is garbed in the gar
ments of the present age and keeps a
sword only for full dress us A s. Yet
Fushimi is a warrior and has seen ser
vice at the front at Port Arthur in the
beginning of the furious struggle
there. A member of the Japanese le
gation has arrived from Washington
end with the Consul-General here is
preparing a reception for the imperial
visitor. The St. Francis will be taxed
for room when the flag of the Rising
Sun waves over that big hotel. Collec
tor Straxton has completed arrange
ments to have the officials and recep
tion committee meet the Manchuria in
the cutter Gulden Gate. As the liner
comes up the bay salutes will be fired
from the forts in the harbor. It is
probable that a number of vessels con
talnjng Japanese citizens will meet the
Manchuria and escort her through the
Golden Gate. Prince Fushimi will not
remain long in this city, as he Is
obliged to hurry on to Washington.
No new developments of any impor
tance were made yesterday in the mat
ter of the defalcations of former Chief
Deputy George A. Wright of the United
States; Internal Revenue, office and of
Cress linger, the suspended seizure
clerk of the Custom House. The lat
ter . department was closed on ac
count of the election,, the only
offices, open being those of the day
watchman and the Surveyor of Cus
toms to transact whatever urgent bus
iness might turn up, Deputy Surveyor
Chauncey M. St. John remaining in
his office: for the greater part of the
day. The Internal Revenue office was
open aB usual, Special Revenue Agent
Bert M. Thomas being busy in going
throueh the books and accounts of
Wright. Mr. Thomas said that he was
Investigating the whole office, includ
ing the outside deputies and would
probably be engaged in that work for
two weeks yet. Stories affecting the
competency and carefulness of Stamp
Clerk Pratt are also being looked
into, but with what result has not yet
been made public.
A circumstance that will assist ma
terially in the defense of Wright is
that Agent .Thomas thus far has not
found any alterations or omissions In
his accounts. None of his records are
missing, so that there will be no diffi
culty whatever in ascertaining the ex
act sum said to have been "held out"
by him.
The charge of "breach of trust'
against Wright was a sore blow to Col
lector Lynch, he having placed impli
cit confidence in the young man. Ow
ing to his friendship for Wright and
his father Collector Lynch surrendered
the whole of a year's salary In order
to make the shortage good.
It Is said that betting on horse races
was the caiise of the ruin of both
Wright and Unger, and that the Inter
nal Revenue office always bore the rep
utation of being a nest of "sporty"
people, whose weakness was the pool
rooms. .The negro Dillard, who is now
in Jail for "grafting" in the matter of
issuing fraudulent Chines^ certfricates,
testified several years ago on the trial
of former Collector Welburn that he
used to carrv a sack of money to the
races to bet on the horses selected by
the clerks in the Internal Revenue of
fice, who had contributed to fill the
sack., Women as well as men. he said,
had given him money to bet for them.
Cress Unjer kept out of the sight
of the general public yesterday, and
could be found only by a few of his
intimate friends and sympathizers.
United States District Attorney
Woodworth spent several hours in his
office yesterday arranging his papers
and looking into the Wright case. He
said 'that he would not move In the
matter of the Unger defalcation untli
he had a^elved instructions from
Washington, and that he expected to
receive them to-day.
No accident marred the launching,
which was superintended by John W.
Dickie, who was assisted by D. Han-
Ion, foreman of thÂ« shipyard. Just be
fore the boat started down the ways
W. F. Kelly, general manager of the
company, placed on the stern of the
vessel a metal plate on which was en
graved the name San Francisco. A
large number of the o^lciala of the
company attended the launching,
among whom were E. A. Heron. J. Q.
Brown and Frank W. Frost. Many
ladles were present.
The San Francisco will be the fast
est ferry-boat on the bay. She will
have engines of 2000 horsepower, which
are estimated to give her a speed of
14 Vj knots an hour. The dimensions of
the new vessel are as follows: Length,
200 feet; beam, 35 feet; depth. 17 VÂ» feet.
The seating capacity will be about 1000.
The cost of the vessel complete will be
1175,000. .
i Promptly at noon to-day the wedfces
which held the new ferry-boat San
Francisco, built by John W. Dickie for
the San Francisco, Oakland and San
Jose Railway Company, on the ways
were knocked from beneath the keel
and with scarcely a tremor the new
vessel glided down the ways and took
the water with a rush. With foam and
spray glancing from Its bow the new
ferry-boat sped through the water,
coming to a stop about 100 yards from
the dock.

Among the seekers of place who
neither won nor were beaten, yesterday
are several gentlemen who have been
mentioned In connection with the long
vacant . permanent j secretaryship of
the Board of University Regents.' A
bare quorum of that body assembled In
regular monthly session at the Hop
kins Institute and discussed little else
than routine that demanded immediate
attention.' The secretaryship was not
even hinted at. Guy Chaffee Earl pre
sided, and those who responded to. the
roll-call were- President Benjamin Ide

Charles William Slack. Jacob Bert
Reinstein, Garret W. McEnerpey, John

Snook was also there.
A vote of thanks was extended to
Mrs. Martin Kellogg for her gift to the
university of the classical library of
her late husband, comprising about 300
volumes. An anonymous alumnus, once
the recipient of a scholarship, was also
thanked for his gift to the university
of $156 In repayment of principal and
interest on the amount â¢ received by
him. The money will be used for a
graduate scholarship for 1905-W.
It was reported that during October
the music and drama fund derived
$&43 77 from entertainments in the
Greek Theater, swelling the total
profits from that source to $1632 61.
This money is laid up against a. pos
sible unprofitable show.
The committee on nnaclal affairs of
the medical department proposed the
establishment of a university hospital
to be administered by the Regents, but
on account of the slimness of the as
semblage the matter was laid over till
the next meeting. ,

ALAMEDA, Nov. 8. â Malcolm
Matheson, husband of Mrs. Leona
Matheson, who with Mrs. M. B. Eitten
was killed by a south side local train
Sunday evening, arrived here from
Redding to-day to arrange for the
burial of his wife. He said it was the
desire of the dead woman's mother,
who lives in Ventura County, to have
the remains taken there for Inter
ment. Before having this done
Matheson said he would confer with
representatives of the Southern Pa
cific Company, as he felt that the
corporation is in some way respon
sible for the death of his wife. He
hinted that a damage suit might be
brought as a result of the double fa
tality. Matheson said his wife was
53 vears of Â«ge.
P. S. White of Los Angeles, a rela
tive of Mrs. Eitten, telegraphed to
Deputy Coroner James Fowler to-day
asking what plans had been made for
the disposition of the woman's re
mains. Fowler replied that he was
holding the body to hear what the
relatives of the deceased wished done
with it He expects definite orders
from White to-morrow.
Coroner H. B. Mehrmann will hold
inquests in both cases at the local
morgue to-morrow evening at 7
o'clock.
The police at the City Hall station
were notified and an investigation
made by the detectives. Mr. and Mrs.
Reed have decided to adopt Miss Wan
da and rear her as their own. "I often
said that it would be delightful to" have
some one leave us a child," declared
Mrs. . Ree'd yesterday, "and it seems
that my prayer has been answered. Al
though I have two children of "my own,
I intend to adopt the baby."
Mystery surrounds the placing of a
four weeks old baby girl on the door
step of Joseph Reed's home, S62 Ellis
street, at a late hour Saturday night.
The police have made an investigation,
but without ascertaining the parent
age of the child. The; infant has been
cared for by Mrs. Reed, and it is her
intention to adopt the little stranger.'
About 11 o'clock last Saturday night
the Reed family were startled by sev
eral sharp rings of the front doorbell.
Upon answering the call no one was
seen and Mrs. Reed was about to close
the door when her attention was at
tracted by something white lying at
her feet. A closer investigation proved
to be most startling, for, snugly bun
dled up in warm woolens, was found a
baby. The tiny mite was contentedly
munching its fist and was gazing at
Mrs. Reed.
Pinned to the child was a note writ
ten in a masculine hand. It was to the
effect that the parents were . unable to
care for their offspring, owing to ex
treme poverty. The Intelligence was
also conveyed that the birth had oc
curred on October 12 and the. little one
had been named Wanda. '

William Berg, the well-known grain
merchant and clubman, had a narrow
escape from death while hunting quail
on the Country Club preserves at Point
Reyes in company with J. Downey
Harvey yesterday morning. Harvey
accidentally shot Befg while the lat
ter was concealed in a clump of
bushes. Five small shot entered
Berg's face, but he escaped serious in
jury.
The accident occurred shortly, after
8 o'clock. Berg and Harvey had
started out an hour before; on a quail
hunt on the preserves. Both men sepa
rated, with the intention of meeting
again after flljing their bags. Harvey
was walking "along near a clump of
bushes, and. hearing a rustle, he aimed
his gun and fired, thinking a band of
quail was about to fly out.
A moment" later Harvey heard a
shriek, and, running to wliere the noise
proceeded, fpund Berg lying on the
ground. Harvey quickly examined the
injured man and then removed him to
the clubhouse,, where - Dr. de Marville
treated him. , The physician removed
five small birdshot from the right
Every effort was made by, the club
officials and - others to keep the acci
dent, a secret. Harvey and the club
officials refused to talk, further than
to say Berg was only slightly wounded
and would recover in a few days. The
physician stated that the wound would
heal rapidly and that Berg would not
be disfigured as a. result, of the few
shot that lodged in his face.
Berg was removed to a sanitarium
at Sausalito in the afternoon. It, was
reported that he ' was resting easily
and had fully recovered from the ner

dent.
cheek of the wounded man. Further
examination failed to disclose any
other injuries.
It is miraculous that Berg was not
killed outright,- as Harvey was only a
short distance away when he fired the
shot. Fortunately, his gun was aimed
toward. the ground, as he thought the
quail would be flying low. This cer
tainly saved Berg's life, for had Har
vey aimed higher it is likely that the
entire : pharge would â¢ have entered
Berg's head and he would undoubtedly
have been killed. , â¢ 'â
