NEW YORK, Nov. 16. â The earnings of the Standard Oil Company for
the quarter just ended, according to an authority in Wall street, have
been the heaviest in the history of that organization, and but for the state
of the public mind as to the greed of great corporations and the lax state
of morality prevailing in "high finance" the greatest dividend in the history
of the company would have been declared on Wednesday.
The earnings are said to have been $22,000,000, or 22 per cent of the cap
ital stock, for three months. It was not {considered wise, however, under
the circumstances, to declare more than 10 per cent, although this dividend
was 3 i>*;r cent more than the dividend declared in the corresponding quar
ter last year.
The disturbances in Russia, which have prevented the normal produc
tion of Russian petroleum, have made the demands abroad for the American
product larger than ever before. Notwithstanding this increased business,
however, the company has swelled its profits still more by steadily ad
vancing the price of petroleum to consumers in the United States.
The petroleum industry is In better shape than it has been since 1900
or 1901. when the stockholders received $46,800,000 in dividends.
ODELL AND PLATT
RESUME FEUD.
Ex-Governor Defies the Senator to
Depose Him as "Boss."
Special Dispatch to The Call.
KKW YORK. Nov. 16. â Ex-Governor Odell to-night defied his enemies
In the Republican organization, even with the sympathetic, backing of
President Roosevelt, to wrest from him the control of the Republican State
machine.
"I'm not going to retire." he said. "I'm going to hold the Republican
party in this State in power. Tm going to do all I can for It. I'm' far from
dead."
This was Odell's answer to the Interview given out by Senator Platt
after his talk with President Roosevelt In Washington on Wednesday.
It was made apparent soon after Senator Platfs arrival at the Hotel
Gotham to-night that open war had been declared between the factions,
and that Platt. having assured himself of his ground in Washington, had
taken the aggressive.
Invitations have been sent out by Senator Platt to all but seven* of the
Republican district leaders in this city to call on him at their convenience
at bis office to discuss the Republican situation. There Is nothing in the
letters to Indicate the nature of Senator Platt's plans. He asks the leaders
to call on him with "open minds," to see what can be done to rehabilitate
the party in New York County.
CUBAN TROOPS HURRIEDLY

Sprciol Cable to The Call and New York Herald. Copyright, 1905, by the
â¢ evr York Herald Publish Ing Company.
HAVANA, Nov. 16. â A dispatch received here at a late hour says that
an uprising has occurred at Manzanillo, and that troops; supposedly destined
for Santiago, are really for the latter place.
Dispatches from Santiago state that a mysterious movement of the local
police and rural guards has been going on for several days. One hundred
artillerymen were sent from Havana. Â« A special train was asked for on ac
count of the necessity for the early arrival of troops.
Officials here deny knowledge of any insurrection, but fear something
may occur. Information reached the palace several days ago to the effect
that disturbances In the eastern end of the island were probable. Senor
Andrade, secretary of . the Government, said to The Call correspondent that
nothing absolute was known, but that the Government- wanted to take all
possible precautions to prevent a repetition of the Cienfuegos Incident.
It is given out here that two more troops of cavalry will be sent The
reason assigned by army officers is possible trouble at the time of the elec
tions on December 1.
The Isle of Pines matter is still absorbing public attention throughout
Cuba. All the Havana papers give much space to the incident. The Govern
ment has sent a gunboat with'- a' special mesenger to Inquire as to the
facts. On account of the distance and there being no .telegraphic commu
nication several days must elapse before* the Government will be satisfied
regarding the situation there.

ST. PETERSBURG, Nov. 17, 2:35
a. m.â Though the. industrial tie-up in
St. Petersburg yesterday was even more
complete than it was on Wednesday,
and though no break has been manifest
ed in the ranks of the workmen and
strikes have j broken out at Moscow and
Revel, the' most important feature ,of
yesterday's developments was the fail
ure of the walkout to I spread generally
outside the capital. The movement ap
parently lacks the spontaneity and con
tagious nature of ;the last great strike,
which broke out at L Moscow, and dis
patches received from the industrial
centers of Russia up to this hour, show
little inclination on; the part of-, the
workmen to take up . cudgels ,in behalf
of Poland.
I The factory .. strike , at Moscow, which
has assumed : considerable proportions,
probably. 45,000 men being out, has . no
direct connection ' with ; the St. Peters
burg walkout, and dispatches: from; the
old capital . say that ~ the railroad men
received the ; request . of the \ St. : Peters
burg strike -,'\u25a0. committee ; coldly. The
whole great network :, of ;â¢ railroads cen
tering at Moscow, except the St. Peters
burg line/is still in j operation.
At Revel the .; employes of \u25a0 the / rail
road shops struck, but the reason for
the strike is not " stated. ;," ;.

the p*etender; .to. the throne has placed
himstlf at the head of the peasantry the
Government will soon . face, besides Its
other troubles, a formidable agrarian re
bellion. It required a year to suppress
the famous rebellion led by Pugaticheft*.
who impersonated the dethroned and
murdered Peter 111 in the time of Cath
crine-11. That rising was started in the
-same region, on the banks of the Volga.
The Workmen's Gazette asserts that a
meeting of soldiers and sailors held to
cay acclaimed the strike movement and
defied the officers who tried to disperse
them. The paper also asserts that troops
have flatly refused to replace the strikers
on the Moscow and St. Petersburg Rail
road.
A panic prevailed on the bourse to
'<3av as the result of a rumor that the
Grand Duke Nicholas Nichalaevitch,
commander of the Imperial Guards, had
betn appointed military dictator.
There was a stampede of holders of
industrial stocks, who hastened to un
lead. Government lotteries fell twenty
five points to 400, and imperial it
dropped to 83*4, a lower point than
\u25a0 touched at any time during the war. .
M. Vouich, chief of Premier de Witte's
'chancellory, authorized the press to poi*
Rively deny the rumor that a dictator
ihad appointed. He also declared
that it had not been decided to declare
'martial Jaw in St. Petersburg. . .
- There was an Immense meeting of
workmen and Polish gympathizers'^t the
Tiew theater on the Moika Canal this aft
ernoon. An overflow meeting: was held
outside. Members of the Polish delega
tion spoke in a very temperrte tone, de
claring that Poland did not seek separa
tion, knowing that an independent Po
land would be an easy prey for Ger
many. It wanted and believed It was en
titled to autonomy and asked for the aid
and co-operation of all believers in the
principle of self-government.
A special meeting of the Cabinet, with
Emperor Nicholas presiding, was held this
Bftemoon at Tsarskoe-Selo to consider
the situation. This was the first meet
ing <>f the Cabinet held under the direct
presidency of his Majesty since the cre
ation of a responsible ministry. The Em
peror, who arrived at the palace at
,Tsarskoe-Selo last night from . Peterhof,
called to-day's meeting upon Count de
"Witte's suggestion. .
Yesterday's meeting of the Ministers
at Count de Witte's residence In the an

until 3 o'clock this morning. After it
ended Count de Witte decided to make a
personal appeal to the workmen and
drafted the following, which Was sent to

"There is no longer any necessity for

Tally Sheets of Late Election
Reveal Some Startling
Discrepancies.
Special Dispatch to Th^ Call.
NEW YORK, Nov. 16.â A sensation
was created in Justice Davis' branch
of the ' Supreme Court this \u25a0 - afternoon
when John r Krup, indicted for illegal
.voting in the recent municipal elec
tion, failed to appear, for pleading and
his attorneys expressed ignorance as to
his whereabouts. Earlier in the day
Krup's release had been secured under
Increased bail.. ' ; ; /
State Attorney General Mayer, who
was in court, was indignant at the turn
of affairs. To-night the. Attorney Gen
eral made public this statement: ' %
"Every effort will be made to ascer
tain who put. up the $5000' bail and who
employed counsel tQ defend Krup. The
failure of Krup to appear in court was
as flagrant a' defiance of law as I ever
heard of.' The disappearance of Krup
is the best confirmation of the state
ment made by, me. in court, urging that
his bail be Increased. I believe there
were reasons apart from his own why
Krup did not appear." v '
. Justice Davey declared the $5000 bail
forfeited. Krup's case was \ reached jat
2 o'clock, but at the request of counsel
was postponed for an ... hour.* At 3
o'clock there was still no sign of: the
defendant.' . His lawyers, Abraham Levy
and former Deputy Attorney General
Charles P. Dillon, .said that -they . had
left h.im but .a short time.. before and
Jie had assured; them that .he would be
in court. .- > ;> r. â¢\u0084.-,,! - \u25a0,\u25a0.\u25a0\u25a0-...-.
"If this defendant â¢ h*as left â¢ .town,"
declared the Attorney General, ."I know
with whom . he was last scen-and will
know" how. to proceed. I thought some
body niuet have been greatly interested
in Kriip to put. up $5000 bail for him
just to secure his ..liberty -for Â«a few

SKXATOR nEPHW'S TESTIMONY;
Senator Depew was examined with
regard to his syndicate participation
and his duties as counsel for the
Equitable Life Assurance Society. -Re
garding the Embassadorshlp. to Paris,
Senator Depew said Hyde came to him
and solicited his influence to secure the
appointment. - â¢ . _
.^ Senator Depew brought the matter
to the attention of the President, al
though he told Hyde that he was too
young, and the . President said.it was
utterly impossible to make; such --.an
appointment.
.The Senator advocated. In. ths;.inter
est the. public, the limiting of In
surance., risks and, favored a public-.au
dit 'qf.^the, accounts, of .companies -at
stated periods by a chartered account

brought for an accounting on .the. pres

Odell was the first witness called to
day. Hughes at once took up the al
leged means employed by the ex-Gov
ernor, to compel reimbursement for his
losses in: the shipbuilding trust.
"Will you state, . Governor," said
Hughes, "whether you had any infor
mation with regard to the introduction
of a bill in the Senate for: the purpose
of repealing the charter of the Mer
cantile Trust Company?"'
"I knew of It at the time, yes."
"Who advised you of It?"

"No, 'sir.'* ','* '
"Was', the-. legislation which was pro
posed by : Senator Ambler in any way a
topic of conversation when the settlement

TALKED WITHHYDE ABOUT IT.
"NeVer, exceptiiigâ yesr When t had a
talk with Mr. Hyde hespoke of it and
1 told him no matter what the outcome
of our settlement migkt be, 'whether I
should go | into the courts or the case
should, be settled, by- the Mercantile Trust
Company, there -was no fear of retaliatory
legislation." . , ..
, "Had ! any thing occurred to change your
mind as to the propriety of the Introduc
tion of such measures?"
."Yes, air.-. The fact that the base cal
umny which Mr. Hyde uttered here haa
been circulated inthe papers; and I
called : Senator Ambler in and I said
that, desirable as I- believed the "legia
lation,' I feared that my unfortunate con
nection with the shipbuilding; matter was
of such" a character : that Mt .would be
better for him to drop: this legislation.
That interview took place some time dur
ing the legislative session of l^M-".
"We have mentioned in the course of
your testimony^ the subject' of contribu
tion's for political purposes Â«.nd you have
stated that you never solicited any from
an lnsufance- company. Were any ere*
made to you voluntarily?"
"Did any ever come to you indirectly?"
"Possibly, through t"h'e National Com
mittee and through ' Senator Platt."
"What relation had Senator Platt " to
the matter?"
"He always gathered all the funds to
gether ever since I have been connected
with Republican politics* except the last
year."
The witness said he knew nothing of
the . efforts of insurance companies to
prevent inimical legislation and knew of
A. C. Fields' activity In that direction
only by hearsay. He did not know An
drew Hamilton. He said no moneys had
ever been placed in his. hands directly or
indirectly for political purposes or other
wise to influence legislation.
DEPEW TURKS REFORMER.
Senator Ch'auncey M. Depew was then
called. The Senator said he had teen
a director of the Equitable since 1371
and was a member of the executive com
mittee. He never heard of . the various
trustee* accounts â¢ until ~ this \u25a0 investiga
tion.' He knew of the campaign, contri
butions only In a general way: Ha did
not know the amount ' contributed - to- the
national .campaign of -1304.. He hoped
both- State and National. Legislatures
would pass laws prohibiting these con
tributions. He thought the contributions
were made in the interests of the as
sured at the time, but he thought, the
publicity given to the matter in this in
vestigation has changed the minds of al
most everybody.
Senator Depew said he was first asked
to go into a syndicate by George H.
Squires. He detailed the .various syn
dicates he had been In during years
past, and said these had. netted him the
sum of $119. In these syndicates .he
had $200,000 tied up most of. the .time,
and JSIOO.'JOO is still tied up. As to hid
retention as counsel by the Equitable
Society, Senate/ Depew said .his state
ment to Superintendent ;Hendricka cov
ered the field; tut he made an extend
ed, statement of his associations with
Henry B. Hyde, and said he continued
as counsel for the society after tho
death of Hyde because it was one of
Hyde's dying/injunctions to his

GILCHRIST'S REVELATION.
John- Gil Christ, In charge of the. se
curity department oi; the Equitable
Life, followed Senator Depew. Gil
christ said. that In order, to reduce the
Equitable - Life .'Assurance
cash on, han.l at. the end of "the year
he had made loans â¢to . Kuhn. Loeb "&

the loan, made a short time before, was
surrendered to the bank and the check
for the, sum of the loan was returned

CHICAGO. Nov. 16.â Although heir
ess to an estate valued at 53,000,000,
provided with every luxury and fur
nished with an ample income, Dorothy
Carter, the 16-year-old daughter of M.
P. Carter, president of the Second Na
tional Bank of Colorado Springs, Colo.,
has* deserted, of her own volition, her
temporary home at 1716 Michigan ave
nue, Chicago. The disappearance dates
t rom; pJovemÃer 1, wben Miss. -Carter
left her Michigan-avenue home.-osten
sibly to visit a neighboring drug stora
to procure . stamps for a letter to her
father.
Since, that time but one clew has
been found by the police to the miss
ing girL On November 1 she visited
a pawnshop and sold a diamond brooch
valued at 5150 for 516. Fifteen min
.utes later she gave some money to two
children who peered through the win
dows of the pawnshop. She seemed to
be much excited and bore evidences
of mental and physical suffering 1 .
Mis* Mabel Carter is inclined to at
tribute her sister's disappearance to
the results of an attack of typhoid
fever more than three years ago, when
the girl suffered some mental disturb
ance. This is her second 'disappear >'
ance within five weeks. She volun
tarily returned the first time after
twenty-four hours' absence.

Petition for Half of Estate
of Late James C. King
STARTS A BIG CONTEST
Renounces an Alleged Ante-
Xuptial Contract Because
It AVas Obtained by Fraud
Special Dispatch to The CalL
CHICAGO, Nov. 16.â Maud A. Robin
son Kins filed a petition in the probate
court to-day declaring that she is the
â¢widow of the late James C. King and
renouncing the alleged ante-nuptial con
tract by which union she was to have
received $103,090, because It was ob
tained by fraud. Under the petition she
lays claim to her dower rights to' an es
tate valued at $3,000,000. James C. King
was a millionaire banker of Chicago, and
â¢well known In the banking institutions
of the West.
In explanation of the contest- for one
half of the estate Attorney Americus B.

"When there is no issue in marriage,
usder the laws of Illinois, a widow by
relinquishing all bequests made to her

half of the real and personal property.
It is for this that Mrs. King is contend
ing."
One of the principal bequests of King
\u25a0was one of about $2,000,000 to be set aside
for a home for old men. He sympathized
with their distress and he read with in
terest everything printed regarding the
age limit of forty-five years, "osleriz
lng" and old age pensions.

business man of Chicago. He laid the
fecundation of his fortune in lumber and

handed to Governor Sparks affidavits
from F. T. Matthews of San Francisco,

the affidavit was signed nearly a month

AWAITS REAPPEARANCE
OF GRTIE MILLAR.
London Misses
Whom a German Nobleman Killed Himself.
STAR OF THE LONDON GAIETY. WHO HAS GONE INTO RETIREMENT SINCE
THE SUICIDE OF A GERMAN NOBLEMAN WHO DECIDED THAT LIFE
WITHOUT HER WAS A FAILURE.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
LONDON, Nov. 16. â Gertie Millar, the
bright particular star of the London
Gaiety, has been "out of the bill" there
since Baron Rau yon Holzhausen, a
young: German nobleman, shot himself
in her boudoir, but it is safe to say
that there will be a crowded house
whenever this extraordinarily popular
singer elects to make her reappearance.
She has had a rather striking career.
Pretty, piquant and graceful, the story
goes that not long before her discovery
by the Gaiety management she was a
mill girl in Lancashire. That is not im
probable, either, for Rosie Boote, the
Gaiety girl who is now Marchioness of
Headfort, started life in AVhitechapel.
Anyhow, it . was a. surprisingly short
time after Gertie Millar's first appear
ance at the Gaiety that she got pro
moted from the chorus to a leading
part in "The Toreador* and caught the
town with her song, "Keep Oft the
Grass." Since when she has been the
star attraction of the famous playhouse
in the Strand, the idol of the gilded
youths and the delight of her pho
tographers, who have frequently been
worried to keep up with the demand
for her likeness.
There is little doubt that she might
have followed the example of Belle
Bllton, Counie Gilchrist and Rosie Boote
and become a member of the British
peerage. But instead Miss Millar de
cided to marry the talented" young com
poser of some of her most successful
songs, Lionel Monckton, whose catchy
melody, "Oh, Listen Co the Band." was
whistled throughout the United States
as well as this country. Of late Miss
Millar has been appearing In "The
Spring Chicken," the French adapta
tion, which was so roundly condemned
not long ago by W. T. Stead. She and
her husband have a house in Russell
Souare and here it was that young
G/inther yon Holzhausen elected to
blow out his brains.
HEIII TO A BIG FORTUNE.
Yon Holzhausen was no two-for-a
penny Continental nobleman. The scion
of one of the oldest families in Frank
furt, he was heir to a big fortune and
left the fatherland chiefly to escape the
enforced military service there, which
did not suit his indolent and somewhat
sentimental temperament. This be
havior, of course, did not please the
Baron's relatives, but up to a short
time ago they seem to have given him
a fairly liberal allowance, .which en
abled him to live at a fashionable hotel,
give expensive luncheons and make
trips to the Riviera.
Yon Holzhausen met Gertie Millar for
the first time about a year and a half
ago and fell desperately in love with
her. This infatuation. It was explained
at the inquest which followed his sui
cide, the actress "endeavored kindly to
check." She corresponded with him,
however, and" they were "Dear Gertie"
and "Dear Gunther," but the young
nobleman really seemed to have
ceived comparatively little encourage^
ment There was no doubt, however,
about the young man's infatuation.
From the beginning of his acquaintance
with Miss Millar he poured out boyjsh
love letters, written in quaint broken
English and Infinitely humble in tone.
One of them read. In part:
I hope you feet well and happy. I very often
think of you. I wish indeed I were your little
dog. Lucky little creature he is. Why do you
refuse tne your photorraph. when you | could
make roe so happy? 7<3gs&sÃ3&
OFTKX. SPOKE OP SUICIDE.
The Baron and the actress originally
met at Nice, where Miss Millar was
staying with a companion, and I after
they got back to town she lunched with,
him occasionally, and once or twice he
had tea at hen house, in the very roomi
In the actress' boudoir, In which Yon
Holzhausen eventually shot himself.
These meetings, however, took place, at
long intervals, and there was always
a third person present â though t,he
third .person never happened tobe Miss
Millar's husband. She says that she
considered Yon Holzhausen only a ro
mantic boy and toward the end
thought that he had got over his in^
fatuation for, her. It is true that, he
once or, twice spoke dramatically, of
â¢'ending it all with a pistol,", and,' a few
days before his suicide, wrote the
actress - that he was absolutely ruined,
but as his letter was written on the
stationery of a fashionable hotel *: and
as she had seen him \u25a0in â¢ the , front row
of the. stalls at- the theater that: after-,
noon she took his statement with sev
eral 'grains of salt.
\u25a0 As a matter of fact, the young Ger
man aristocrat* was "broke." ; His rela
tives' had finally \u25a0 cut off his allowance
owing to "V his . continuous \u25a0 refusals to
come home and "perform \his" military
service.- and" at~ the time \ot .his; death
bis hotel bill .was , two ; weeks overdue
and he had been" asked ' rather; peremp
torily, to pay up. Evidently he v was
THE SAN FRANCISCO GALL, vNQVEMBER 17, - 1905.
more in love than ever with the actress,
too, and her indifference to him preyed
on his mind. In his last note to Gertie
Millar he wrote: "I am absolutely
done. I have been backing horses, too,
and at last I.e.:n utterly worn out like
an old man."
BULLET EXDS HIS LIFE.
What the' young man's object was
in gaining entrance to- the actress'
boudoir at S o'clock in the morning
has not been satisfactorily explained.
It has been suggested that perhaps he
expected to find her there and meant
to shoot her before killing himself, but
it seems more likely that he wanted
the morbid satisfaction of dying under
the loved one's roof. At the time' he
shot himself the Gaiety .star and her
husband were asleep on the floor above.
Yon Holzhausen gained -^entrance to
Miss Millar's boudoir by* breaking a
window at the back of the house and
then raising it after drawing the catch.
Then "he seems to have removed his
boots and stretched himself at full
length on tho floor, for a servant en
tering the room in orHer to air it wa*
frightened by seeing a pair of stock
inged feet appearing from behind the
piano. Another glance showed her that
a man was lying there,^ and thinking
that he was a burglar, the frightened
domestic rushed upstairs to alarm her
master and mistress. She had barely
reached the second floor -when a re
volver shot rang through the house and
awakened every one "In It. Lionel
Monckton, told by the servant what
had taken place, had the door of the
boudoir locked instantly and sent for
the police as well as for a neighboring
surgeon. They found Yon Holzhausen
with a revolver clutched in his hand
and a wound in his tcmfle. Removed
to the nearest hospital he died irv^the
course of the morning. At the inquest
the jury brought in. a verdict of self
murder. , :;"?jC."-

Nez Perec Indians from all parts; of

and held- a ; meeting, to protest
against the new order of the Interior
Department requiring Indian guardians

from heing after the old Indian customs
and was not held in the open aÂ«r. with
long-haired - bucks seated on the
ground in a big circle.'
Instead a hall at a hotel was secured
and the Indians, went through; the

chairman and took turns at speaking.
Those inattendancewere reticent about
telling the results of the meetnig, but
it was learned that a delegation was
selected to call on Agent Dew at the
agency< to-morrow and lay tho matter
before him. In addition to this.itis
planned to send a delegate or delega

In the past ; the bucks have been
guardians for their own children,with
out the necessity of an order ofcourt
and have leased their, own children s

Lucia Island, in the West Indies and
their places filled with men taken on

der.t and that cue of the crew was killed
and four other? terribly scalded.
Captain Sweetzer refused to talk of the
accident, ar.d would net give out the
lames of the dead and injured. When
the vessel arrived in port, however, he
ttated to United States officials thai the
disaster hud occvirrfd when the ship was
but a few days out. The Injured men

Th<? Californian is to discharge about
2DPO tons of freight here. Included in this
amcuut are IK*) tor.s of steel rails for

TACOMA, Nov. 16. â Engineers em
ployed by the Geological Survey are
making a thorough invesiigatipn of the
black sand deposits of Ocean Beach
about Willapa Harbor. Dr. Day. chief
of the division of mining', says the ex
ttr.t of the sand beds Ss practically
\u25a0uulim'ted, running- to a depth of sev
enty feet. Samples have been taken
from the surface sands and from the
bottom of the beds and rich minerals
always appear when the sand is con
centrated. He says the deeper sand is
obtained the richer it is in minerals.
He believes that concentration will
yield an average value of JT per ton.
A $100,000 plant is being established
at Damons Point, near Hoquiaxn. for
the manufacture of tool steel direct

DONATION IS EEJECTED
Convention Will Not Accept
* Money Offered for Enter
tainment by H. C. Frick
PITTSBURG. Nov. 16.â At the session
of the American Federation of Labor
this morning , Delegate Johannsen of
fered a motion rejecting a donation of
1100 made by H. C. Frick for the en
tertainment of the federation, delegation.
The speaker said the money was tainted
\u25a0with the blood of the Homestead steel
eirike and should not be accepted un
c"er any circumstances. The motion was
vigorously cheered and Johannsen was
requested to put it in writing and pre
sent it later to the convention for ac
tion. â¢ ...
There was a slight pjmic among the
tfetegates caused by the decorations in
the rear cf the hall taking fire from
seme unknown cause. A rush was made
for the fire exits, but quiet was soon
restored by President Gompers rapping
loudly for order. The fire burned Itself
cut in a few moments and the conven
tion resumed the transaction of busi
ness. No one v. - as injured.
The morning session was quite slrenu
cus. P. H. 6cul2in. a labor organizer
known to union men in all parts of the
United States, was severely criticised by
Frank Duffy of Indianapolis, who took
exception to the action of the federation
In adopting a resolution indorsing the
Industrial Peace Association. Delegate
Duffy, who Is secretary of the Brother
hood of Carpenters and Joiners, charged
Bcullin with irregularities in connection
t\ith labor affairs in various parts of
the country.
President Gornpers announced that the
matter would be given attention later.
W. Mosser. fraternal delegate from the
British Labor Trades Council, addressed
the convention on the labor situation in
England.
The motion presented at the morning
pession declining the $100 offered by H.
C Frick for the entertainment of the
delegates in this city was withdrawn this
afternoon by Delegate Johannsen. He
announced he had learned that the money
had not been presented yet and that it
would be rejected when it was offered
and for this' reason withdrew the mo
tion.
The convention adjourned at 8 o'clock
until to-morrow morning ln order to give
the committees additional time in which
to prepare their reports.
Victor L. Berger. delegate of the In
ternational Typographical Union, said:
"I <35d not introduce any resolution to
indorse the Socialist party, and no reso
lution of that kind will be introduced.
The Socialists of America have got
through with childish business long ago.
We do not want to 'capture' the con
vention of the American Federation of
Labor for the Socialist party. All the
resolutions which I have introduced are
purely trades union resolutions.
â¢\u25a0We Socialists believe in a two-armed
labor movement, a labor movement with
a political arm and economic arm. The
erms must remain distinctly separate.
"We understand that tlie American Fed
eration of Labor is the economic arm of
the American labor movement, hence our
purely trades union resolutions."

When Louie Leong, a Chlneae cook,
recovered from the spell that two black

yesterday morning: he was shy \u25a0 J7. He
believes that the coin disappeared while
he was locked in the fervent dual em

Louie was meandering down Pine street
to a dream factory, when two voices from

going, honey?" So well did the ladles
blend with the darkness that for a while
Louie could see nothing. At last he
made out two forms that loomed up a
trifle darker than the general gloom.
They encircled the embarrassed Celestial

"Wha' foh?" stammered Louie. "Wha"

, "He's; mine, 'I saw him first," said onfe

looked like a bucketful j of Butchertown

ment says in part: - . .
Ten separate pleas in bax have been filed.
each of them alleging facts which It la claimed
ought to bar the Government from proceeding
further In this case. ; . , ;
\u25a0 Eight of these pleas are based upon the , al

of Corporations, in making an Investigation of
the affairs of the defendants in pursuance of
the authority conferred upon him. by law and
In special obedience to the 'resolution of the
House of Representatives requiring him -to
make such investigation. ' : â¢;. â¢.. ~
The Attorney General asserts In : th* most
positive terms that none of the information ob
tained by Mr. Garfleld' was used â¢ before the
Grand Jury and further says that he Is ' In
formed by Mr. Garfield, and believes, -that at
certain stages of the Investigation tho'defend
ants declined to give Information unless . they.
tvere put in a position to obtain the Immunity
provided by the act of Congress and required
by the constitution of the United States, and
that when' such Instances occurred, acting after

further and made no further attempt to obtain
Information, documentary or otherwise, along

â¢ The seventh plea in bar urges that the, Gov

ment denies that it obtained any papers.other

rubbish at the bottom of an air sbaft
and spread through the interior of a
grocery on the ground floor. A police
man was the first person to see the
fire. Just aa it had begun to creep up
the air shaft. He ran into the building,
pounding on the hall doors j all *the way
up to the sixth floor to awaken the ten
ants. â¢ The fire " followed him so swiftly
that when he reached the top floor he
was obliged -.to send, the tenants' through
the fire escapes to save them suffoca
tion. Within, a -few moments more on
all the floors below the fire escapes were
packed with .persons whom the flames
had cut off from escape by the interior
stairways.
When ; the flre department arrived with
ladders nearly every one" on the flre es
capes was kneeling in prayer. -Adding
to the pathos, of the scene was .the ac
tion of the - men who stood with their
arms full of personal possessions while
their wives fought unaided to protect the
children 'from' being trampled by the
crowd or, suffocated by smoke.

found the bodies of three women and two

HOWISON'S WARM WOEDS
"Wallowing in Dirt" Fails
â¢to Appeal to Scholar as
a Praiseworthy Exhibition
BERKELEY, Nov.. 16.â Professor
George H. I-lowison of the department
of philosophy uf the State University
added his condemnation of the same of
football .to the diatribes directed
against thesnert by President Eliot and
other college authorities,? in' a lecture
before his class in ethics to-day, cre
ating a sensation with his pointed at
tack upon the favorite college- sport, v
Football plnyers "wallowing; in. dirt"
remind Professor Ho'.vison . of . ''pigs/
and it was as "pigs",- that the venerated
philosopher spokeof. the players, to
day. His -contempt for the exhibitions
of brute . .forte provided at football
games, hfis been expressed before, in
other years; but to-day the distinguish
ed philosopher gave a new turn to tho
discussion of the ethics of the ?ame
when he fastened upon the football
stars, the undignified appellation of
"pit's." " - : : :
Professor Uowison spoke In part 8.3
follows: <x '-' \u25a0 s '\u25a0'''*" ' \u25a0â¢
College spirit, and college loyalty are given
very poor millets for expression when a football
tra'me, .in which eleven fools contest with eleven
other fools in the dirt for supremacy, is util
ized as the occasion " for exhibiting the 80
caiied loyalty and spirit. In my opinion, college
loyalty could better be shown by applause and
cheers for such men as Royce and Bakewell,
than for Knlbbs and Overall. ' .
The spectacle of twenty-two men 'wallowing;
In the ijlrt of a football field inevitably sug
gests plgy rolling in mire, while thousands of
persons "Â»oot" In grand stands at the spec
tacle urov'ded on the field. We know what
sort' of animal* "root." Pigs "root." The
piK:idea is pretty fully carried out in the foot
ball frenzy. It Is all degrading, disneartentng.
It seems to. represent the supremacy of dirt
and interest In brute force and animalism
rampant. \u25a0 â¢ \u25a0 v . ;
People pay t" 50 apiece to see the exhibit!-,
tion. and perchance to i>ee one of the "plga"
killed.' Then it is called "loyalty to college":
and an "exhibition of college spirit."' We are
supposed as university men to stand .for
scholarship, and mental effort, but >when the
"rooting" is all for a pig-like exhibition pro
vided* by men wallowing in the dirt, our ideals
'teem to have -sadly degenerated.

FROM SOCIETY
OF ENGINEER
Seniors and Juniors of the
Stanford University Decide
Upon Class Organization
W BERKELEY BODY
Patterned After a Similar
Group of "C.E." Students
at the State Institution
Special Dlsp*tch to ThÂ« Call.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY Nov. 16.â
The junior and senior students in the
department of civil engineering at the
Stanford University at a meeting hem
last night formally organized into
what is to be known as the Civil en
gineering Society. The organization Is
similar to the" Society of Engineers at
California. The Idea of the body is to
gather at regular times and discuss
topics dealing with their branch or
work.
At the gathering last night the con
stitution, which was drawn up by a
committee of five, was accepted as It
stands. This document provides for
regular monthly meetings throughout
the university year. It provides that
the official business of the society shall
be entrusted to an executive commit
tee. \u25a0 Thi3 committee is composed ot
the officials of the body and another
member elected at large.
G. S. Strout. '06, was chosen as the
first president of the society; F. O.
Shutts, '06, vice president: M. C. Burr.
'07, secretary; O. G. Stanley. '06, treas
urer, and C. A. Strong, '07. the addi
tional member of the executive com
mittee.'
The movement was first set on foot
here By a suggestion from the organi
sation at California -that the Stanford
i men get- together and form a society
and affiliate with them for the purpose
of advancing the* work at both univer
sities. The Â«ocal students looked Into
the matter and decided to organize, but
not to affiliate.- - -
SAILOR AKEESTED
AETEK TESTIFYING
Edward Crape Leaves the
r Wtness-Stand for
\u25a0:-:. the Jail. X;
The suit, of Edward A. Crape against
the steamship Sonoma and her master,'
Captain C. F. Herriman, was tried yes
terday before United States "District
Judge de Haven ; without a jury and
taken under advisement.
The action was brought to recover
$1000 as wages and as damages for
personal Injuries. Crape on the stand
said he went Into the service of the
steamship as a marine fireman with $50
per month as wages. On August 29,'
1904, while* the vessel was Â» at Sydney.
Australia, he was convicted by the'
local authorities - of. an , assault upon
t.heT "mate ' and was" imprisoned for I two"
itnonlhs /in the jail at that place. At
the. ; expiration . of that time, -he : was
taken by the .local authorities' to the
steamer which j In 'the meanwhile . had
made a trip to San Francisco and re
turned. * There .by order of Captain
Herriman he was chained by the leg
to a stanchion in ' the baggage room
for six days and in the forepeak for
ten days, where he "alleged he suffered
very much from the heat.
Depositions were read from several
members of the crew to the effect that
the room In which Crape was confined
was the coolest apartment in the ves
sel and that they often slept there to
avoid the heat. ... , .
After Crape had â¢ left the courtroom
he was placed under arrest by Deputy
United States Marshal Dingley on a
warrant issufed by United States Com
missioner Heacock November 29, 1904,
charging him with having assaulted
Mate Koughan on September 1, 1904. in
the harbor of Sydney. His bail was fixed
at $500, and his examination will take
place as soon as the Sonoma shall ar
rive, the witnesses for the prosecution
being on board that vessel.. F. R. : Wall
is attorney for Crape and Frank &
Mansfield represent the defendants.

SEATTLE. Nov. 16.â Slow progress
was made in the Alaska convention to
Â«iay, most of the time bein^ taken up
\u25a0with the question of the proxies and
the statement of Colonel Perkins deny
ing: a movement to secure his indorse
ment by the convention for Governor
of Alaska.
The proxy question was brought up
by order of Governor Swlneford, who
declared that he would leave the con
vention if any but citizens of Alaska
were allowed a seat or a vote in the
convention. He demanded that the
eeating of proxies be confined to
those entitled to vote at any election
pending in Alaska. After a long and
heated debate a compromise was reach
ed by including those engaged in the
development of the mining or other re
sources of Alaska In the number en
titled to vote proxies.
In his statement before the conven
tion Colonel Perkins declared that he
\u25a0would oppose any question coming be
fore the convention that touched on
any of the present officials of Alaska.
Governor "Swlneford also touched on
the question of a Territorial form of
government, which, he said, should be
the principal question before the con
vention, but neither matter was
brought before the convention in a for
mal manner.

Announce Light Showers
To-Day in San Francisco
At last the long overdue rain prom

California. Yesterday the interior cen

first wettings of. the season.
The gentle moistening covered an
area from Los Angeles and San Diego
on the south to Oregon and Washing

yet to break the. 192 days of dry spell,
but the forecast to-day predicts that
the entire State will receive a bath.
Light showers are scheduled for San
Francisco and vicinity.
The greatest portion of the rain in
California fell over the central and
southern parts of the -State. West
winds have rolled up banks of clouds
along the Pacific Coast and the tem
perature has dropped from eight to
twelve degrees in the San Joaquin Val
ley and in the southern parts of the
ctate. Independence and North Head
received ovtr a fifth of an inch of
rainfall, while Fresno was visited by a
little less than a fifth. f%s Angeles
had nearly half an inch of rainfall.
Comparison of the rainfall of this
season with last year shows that from

RESIDENT DIES
Eicliardo Sanchez, Born in
Mission Dolores in 1838,
Is Called to His Fathers
Richardo Sanchez, who will be buried
to-day- from St. Charles Borromeo
Church, was one of the descendants of
the Sanchez family whose name has been
associated â¢ with San Francisco from Us
earliest days. -
Richardo Sanchez, who passed away
Wednesday, was born in the Mission Do
lores in 1&38. His father was Joseph San
chez, also a native of San Francisco, and
a man foremost among his Spanish con
freres ' ' â¢\u25a0; . \u25a0 *" . . . '
Richardo grew up to be of a daring
nature and probably his desire for an ex
citing life led him to adopt the calling
of a vaquero. Thirty years ago in that
capacity he took employment with the
Brandenstein Company, wholesale butch
ers and cattle dealers, with which, firm
he* remained until recently incapacitated
by the illness' which terminated fatally.
While never connected with , politics he
took a lively interest : in the develop
ment of the now great city, of San Fran
cisco, which in his youth he remembered
as a vast cattle ranch with its wild, com
manding hills and richly pastured val
leys/scarcely touched by the hand of
man. t
Sanchez was the father of fourteen
children, seven of whom, with his wife,
survive him. They are Mrs. Geneva'Bor
dan, Mrs. Annlta Hansel, Mrs. Henerietta
Muller and Richard, Robert, Charles and
Solomon Sanchez. \u25a0 "

Postmaster Arthur G. Fisk will visit
Eastern cities early in ' January next
and it is quite probable that during his
sojourn in Washington,- D.C.. the sub
ject of additional ? or better postal fa
cilities- for San Francisco will be con
sidered by the California- Congressional
delegation and the Postmaster General.
It is yet ah open question .whether the
clerical force attached ito the postofflce
here is adequate, but the fact Is od
vious that in some respects the
ice is inefficient.
Information from the department is
to the effect that the, allowance for
the maintenance of the postal service
in this city is quite as liberal as that
extended to New York. â¢;. Boston, Chi
cago, Philadelphia and other cities of
the East. The department bases the
allowance on~the o/fice receipts and on
this basis the amount appropriated 'for
the San Francisco office is fair, if not
liberal.v ,:
Conditions in San Francisco differ
from those in the large cities of the
East. Here very nearly all the incom
ing malls are\deposited at the ferry
depot, foot of Market street, and the
weak place in the local, system is in-,
adequate facility for the immediate
transmission of. the pouches from the
ferry to. the general postofflce at Mis
sion and Seventh streets.
.MAILS HELD AT PKHRY.
For example, if the overland trains
carrying the great bulk of the mails
arelate and do not come in until after
midnight, the pouches containing let
ters tfnd bags containing papers re
main at the ferry station until the
electric cars on the Mission-street line
resume service at 6 o'clock in the
morning. Thero is electric current for
the Mission cars east' of \ Third street
from midnight" until day dawns. Dis
tribution of the most' important mails
is therefore frequently delayed for five
or six hours.. Mall, sacks to the num
ber of 300 are thrown into the great
postoffice when the'clerks are very
busy distributing the , dropped letters
throughout the city. " \u25a0'_'
One remedy for the congestion in the
office at Seventh .and Mission streets
is the* re-establishment of a distribut
ing station at the ferry._ That Is con
sidered to be the proper place Tor the
work of distributing for the city and
also for the work of collection, as all
car -lines center ' there. -But the de
partment at Washington no doubt con
siders that the Government 'has . ex
pended 54,000,000 for a postoflice at
Seventh and Mission streets, and hold
that the work should be done there. -
IDEAS FOR IIIiT'IEK SERVICE.
Pneumatic tubular service between
the general postofflce and the ferry is
something that the Government should
introduce. Pending construction of the
tube the; department vsho'iftd. "authorize
the â¢ Postmaster -.. to use automobiles or
wagons for receiving and dispatching
malls. \ San* Francisco should not. be
put to the inconvenience of , relying on
the Mission-street car" line. V^ These are
ideas of the local "department officials.
The car service on Mission, Market or
any other leading thoroughfare is liabla
to Interruption by reason of fire. As a
temporary measure of relief an allow
ance, it is suggested, should be made
by the department for an automobile
to handle overland j mails arriving at
the ferry after, the cars stop running.
.RAILWAY MAIL HANDLING.
Inquiry regarding the distribution in
transit of . incoming ! letters and papers
created the; impression that the rail
way mail service in California Is some
what but of -date. It appears that
packages of letters made up for : San
Mateo, Menlo, Redwood, Sausalito, San
Rafael, San Jose and other near-by
towns often come to the General Post
office In San â¢ Francisco. For.example
a packageor, pouch of letters for Palo
Alto may come: in after .midnight on
the' : overland and not be delivered at
the General Postoffice here until 7 a. m.
Delay in handling may result in failure
to catch the first train in the morning,
so the mail" will" not reach its destina
tion until afternoon. Transfer of mail
in transit should be , made at all con
necting points, obviating the system of
sending to the General Postofflce in
this city any mail -matter destined to
near-by (or remote towns.
: The railway postoffice service in and
out of San Francisco may be as efficient
as the'-service Tin and out of Chicago,
where it had its first- trial and where
its value.was so quickly demonstrated,
but it may not be reinforced here as it
is there with connecting ,;'mail .\u25a0: agent

FEAR FOR LIFE
OF TINY MAID
Yuen Ho, Chinese Slave Girl,
May Have Eaten Poisoned
Sweets on Board Mongolia
THREAT AGAINST HER
Officers Try to Stop Ship
and Investigate the Affair,
but Are Not Successful
When the big Hiier. Mongolia, now far
out on the. Pacific on her way to China,
left this port yesterday, there was hud
dled among the Orientals; in her steer
age ; little Yuen Ho, a pretty Chinese
slave girl. At her side was a dainty par
cel, handed her just as the ship was to
leave and which the girl accepted .with
a pretty smile of thanks. The parcel
contains the most luscious of Chinese con
fections, but in I those sweatmeats may
lurkthe deadliestof poisons; for. the of
ficials in this city, fear that the j man
who ; managed jto have the parcel passed
to ; Yuen Ho was plotting against the
life of this Oriental maid and adopted
this ruse to murder her. Little Yuen Ho
may be singing softly to herself in the
steerage of the great ship, glad that she
is about' to return to her own home in
far away China, 'or, the food may have
been' deadly: ere this and she may be on
her long journey toward Nirvana. Until
the \u25a0 Mongolia reaches Honolulu and the
news is flashed back to San Francisco, no
onewill be able to tell whether the voy
age of the little odalisque was one of
plfca^sure or of death. Anxious hearts will
await th* outcome.
SI,A.VE GIRL IX SOUTH.
Yuen Ho was a slave girl of the south
land. : She was stolen from her home
beside the scented swamps in China and
brought over to, San .Diego. Entry into
the United States was made successfully
and her owner was happy. He had made
a remunerative purchase. Then came the
Government officials. >Yuen Ho had no
papers. She must go back. ,
Her owner' wished to take hereto JjOS
Angeles and there appeal her case, but
not so with YuenjHo. She was glad she
had been captured, glad that she could
once more live a free woman. She would
hot go to Los Angeles. She told the
officers to send her away as soon as they
could.'
The owner was very angry. His cap
tive was slipping away from him. He
threatened her with torture and death,
telling, her that she would never reach
her. native land .alive.' '. ,/ â¢'\u25a0 â¢
Yuen Ho shuddered in terror and asked
the officers to guard her from this [ man.
On Wednesday they brought her, to San
Francisco and at once placed her on the
Mongolia. She was happy then. Her
owner could not reach her.
But the sinister master had followed
her from the southland. He was turned
away when he tried to see her.
GETS PARCEL OF SWEETS.
Just before the ship 'sailed a Chinesa
woman was allowed on board. She had
a parcel of delicacies for the little Yuen
Ho. The officers- passed her without
question, for she was a Christian wo
man. She gave the parcel to Yuen Ho
and left the boat.""! ,- ,\u25a0-.,--,_ .... .'.
Then a horrible -Idea .struck her.uShe
had not at first recognized the man who
had stopped her on the wharf and asked
her to -take the parcel^ to Yuen Ho. - Now
she rememfcered the J face. 'It was the :
owner of the slave girl. ;
.With terror stricken steps, . she hur
ried to the ' Presbyterian Mission, 920
Sacramento street, the superintendent of
which, ! Miss Cameron, was an old time
friend. Quickly she poured out the story
to this good .woman. Miss Cameron lost
no time. She telephoned, at once to Im
migration Officer Charles Mehan. â¢â¢Save
the girl," was her message. ;
Mehan lost no time. The boat had al
ready left the dock. He telephoned to
Meiggs wharf to get a Government ves
sel, but none was lying there. Two of
Crowley's launches were sent out with
inspectors aboard in an attempt to stop
the ' great ship. But the Mongolia had
too great a lead. She did not hear the
signals. She steamed away, farther and
farther. The Inspectors returned unsuc
cessful.'.Yuen Ho was on the vessel and
the parcel of sweets was at her side.
Miss Cameron is hoping for the best.
"It may be that the \ sweetmeats were
not poisoned," shej said, "although the
man had threatened her life. We 5 can
only wait until the ship reaches ' Hono
lulu." "
In the meantime, the rumor is about
that the owner has planned to recapture
her when the ship reaches China. Poor
little heathen maid! ..What hours of
darkness are in store for her !

The Santa Fe Railroad Company will
in a few days turn over to the city
the new Third-street bridge crossing
Channel street. The bridge will be
operated by . two electric motors, lo
cated-at cither, end of the structure.
The motors can only be run with the
direct electric; current and it will be
necessary for the city , to lay a cable
under Channel street, as the direct cur^.
rent is only^supplied on one side. by the
San Francisco Gas and Electric Com
pany, the other side having what Is
konwn as the alternating current.
A test was made yesterday of the
working of the bridge with satisfactory
results. The bridge cost $163,000, of
which the Santa Fe Company will pay
$108,000 and the Southern Pacific Com
pany $55,000. When the companies
agreed to build the bridge it was esti
mated that it would cost $125,000 and
the Santa Fe Company had to stand the
increased cost. . . \u25a0
" The building of the bridge was one
of the conditions imposed on the Santa.

The Supreme Court decided yesterday
that the British American Assurance
Company must, pay G. D. Welch $2000
in Insurance.
G. H. Barrett took out the Insurance
on a house which was subsequently
burned. A clause in the policy pro
vided that the document should become
void In case the ownership of the prop
erty should be changed without the
knowledge of the company.
Barrett executed a trust deed to the
property to Welch on a mortgage.
When Welch attempted to collect the
insurance the company declined to pay
on the ground that there had been a
change of ownership. The court ad
mits the error of Barrett, but holds
the clause in question ambiguous, and
following the general rule In such,
cases the jmsured gets the benefit of the
doubt.

FRIDAY NOVEMBER 17,. ioos
RUSSIA IN AGONY.
!q^HE situation of the Czar's empire becomes hourly more diffi-
I cult. The opinion gains ground that the empire is in .the
\u25a0*\u25a0 agonies of dissolution. The Government finds it no longer pos
sible to exercise its functions, except over a very limited area, and
there only through an army the loyalty of which is open to sus
picion. " The press dispatches arc markedly hysterical in character,
but even this exhibits the lensity of the situation. The reporters
find it difficult for their imaginations to run fast enough to keep
in sight of the facts.
Wittc, the only powerful figure in the whole situation, lacks
entirely the one thing needful. He has no hold upon the turbulent,
ignorant and superstitious people. The real power is in the hands
of the revolutionary committee called "The League of -Leagues."' It
lias taught the people the power that they hold by tying up all the
railroads and all the industries of Russia. When this was firstj
done, by paralyzing transportation, it forced the Czar to come down
eff his ftiks and grant popular rights under a form of government
approximating that of the constitutional monarchies of Elurbpe.
This roused Finland, and in the ebullition of a day she regained the
1 ights arbitrarily taken away by the Czar two years ago. The Finns
received this with a satisfaction that had in it no element of gratitude
:-nd no increase of loyalty to the autocracy.
Xo sooner was Finland satisfied than Poland dreamed again of
restoring the kingdom of Sobieski, and was at once enmeshed in
martial law. Instead of this violent measure quieting the agitation
for Polish autonomy, it added to it. Xow 'The League of Leagues"
renews its plan of stopping all Russian industries by a political
strike, not only in the interest of Poland, but for the destruction
of the empire. The Czar, who owns one-third of the land in Euro
pean Russia, in a panic of fear proposes to jettison his land to save
his dynasty. By giving it, on easy terms, to the agricultural peas
antry he hopes to secure their loyalty and support.
So far, however, the revolution, for it is nothing else, seems
to have reached that stage at which concessions, no matter how
great, do not placate. That is the history of such revolutions.
Louis XVI, frightened by the uprising of the French people, con
ceded representation,, enlargement of parliamentary power and all
of the primary demands in vain. The flood rose higher with every
concession inteuded to stay it, until only his head in the basket
would satisfy the people.
Looked at by the sober Anglo-Saxon mind, it would seem that
the proper course for the Russians would have been to accept the
last concessions of the Czar, and proceed to organize a representa
tive government thereunder. This was Witte's hope, but it is not
realized. Russia is simply in anarchy. Everywhere the people fall
upon whatever they have been taught to hate, and are wreaking
upon it a savage vengeance. The fruit of ages of ignorance and su
perstition is ripe now. The mob, no longer in fear of control, has
turned upon the forlorn Jews. The orthodox church taught hatred
of the Jews as part of the religion of the people, and now that ha
tred effervesces in a mad massacre, which there is no government
to prevent.
This is an appalling feature in the bedlam of events. The Jews
in this country have rallied to succor their beleaguered brethren, and
in their distress are calling upon President Roosevelt to stay the
slaughter. But the President can impress the situation only
through the Russian Government, and there is none. Until a
leader appears whose voice can be heard through all the wreck that
was the empire, it seems impossible for any outside influence to be
made effective. If the revolution were going through the stages of
Mirabeau, Robespierre, Danton, Marat, Bonaparte, there would be
some hope. But no procession of successive leaders appears.
There is nothing but sodden and frenzied slaughter. Human life
is the cheapest thing in Russia. The results of ages of artificial
repression are upon the country. The restraint of power being re
moved, the people have no self-restraint to take its place, and from
Vladivostok to Warsaw the business of men is murder.
It is useless to blame the Government as it is at present. It
has been frightened into about every concession that the outside
world could demand of it. But every drop of oil it has poured upon
the troubled waters has only increased the storm, until it is entirely
beyond control. Outsiders lift their vision above the scene of mob
and murder and sweep the Russian horizon for a leader in vain.
Witte is evidently unable to command the situation. The Czar and
the Grand Dukes, the admirals and the generals hate him, and the
people are too ignorant and mad to obey him. There seems nothing
to do but let the storm of madness and bloodthirst spend itself, and
then gather up the fragments and institute order. The crimes of
the autocracy are being fearfully expiated, but there seems to be
no other way. Through agony and blood atonement another Rus
sia may rise.' clothed and in her right mind.
THE MURDERS AT LIENCHAU.
ONE of the American missionaries who escaped from the mas
sacre at Lienchau has thrown light upon the cause of that
bloody butchery. The Chinese were holding a religious festi
val and part of their pavilion overhung the compound or yard of
the mission station. The missionaries demanded its removal. While
this is not quite clear, it is implied that the Chinese assented to the
removal, but, pending action, one of the missionary party entered
the pavilion and carried off some of the paraphernalia held sacred
by the Chinese. This at first caused great consternation and then
resentment. In the dispute that followed blows were struck and
murder followed. Â»
The verdict of level-headed people will be that the massacre
was caused by lack of common sense, of Christian common sense
and spirit, on the part of the missionary who seized and carried off
that which he had no right to touch. Missionaries are not invited
by the Chinese. They go there as spiritual invaders of the country,
to break up a sj'stem of religion on which civil government is
founded. It may be a bad system, but it suits the Chinese. To the
secular mind it seems that missionaries ought to respect the. rights
of the Chinese to their own form of the religious idea, and that
Christianity would be -best presented to them in its compassionate
features, its patience, charity and long suffering. This cannot be
done by a hot-headed missionary who , not only tramples on what
the Chinese hold sacred, but is "guilty "of stealing and carrying off
the sacred properties of one of their spiritual shows. ; > A
If Chinese in San Francisco should enter a Christian .church
and defile it, we are of the opinion that there would be trouble
here. Common sense is needed in deajing religiously, and from the
missionary standpoint, with the Chinese. Not many years ago
American missionaries seized a Chinese child because in play .he
had hit the fence of their compound with a stone. They took him
inside and locked the door. His parents came pleading for the res
toration of their child. The foolish missionaries refused. Then a
mob gathered, tore down the compound, recovered the child and
burned the buildings. No lives were lost, but our Government, un
justly, forced China to pay a high price for the destroyed property.
Here again was need of the saving grace of common sense, just as
necessary for a missionary as piety. ..i^:

AND IT WASN'T A FOOTRALB GAME, EITHER
A LMHG OR A LIFE.
There's a mighty big: difference be
tween making: a living and making: a
life.
Almost any one can make a living.
Not every one can make a life.
In making a living one may or may
not have to work hard. In making a
life â building characterâ one must do
the hardest kind of work.
Some men have their living made for
them. But their lives cannot be made
for them.
He whose living is made for him by
another usually makes a poor business
at making a life. He is not used to
working at anything 1 .
The canoeist must paddle hard going
up stream. He can drift down stream.
So It is easy to drift along making a
living and failing to make a life. It is
easy to lie and to deceive. It Is easy
to go with the current. It 13 easy to
give way to. tdmptatipn. It takes
moral fiber to tell the 1 truth and to
turn down temptation.
Tako lying, for instance. v
A man can make himself believe
that a. lie can be told with good in
tentions, that .tlujre 'is. puch a thing as
a "lie of necessity/* Once a man adf
mits that to himself -he Is subtly, pols
onously deceived.^ The belief gets into
practice. 'And the practice is a boom
erang. It reacts on the man's life. It
! weakens his character. Somebody, has
said that even God cannot afford to
lie in order that good may come. And
I what God Almighty cannot do a man
had better not try.
A man deserves no credit for mak
ing a living. He deserves great credit
for making a life.
The only thing- on earth any man
has a right to be proud of Is his char
acter. It represents something. It
stands for striving. deprivation,

Ificrcasiog Among Women, Bat
Sufferers Weed Wot Despair
THE BEST ADVICE IS FREE
Of all the diseases known, with which
the female org-anigm is afflicted, kidney
disease is the most fatal, and statistics
chow that this disease is on the increase
among women. V V
Unless early and correct treatment is
applied the patient seldom survives
when once the disease is fastened upon
her. Lydia B. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound is the most efficient treat-
ment for kidney troubles of women,
and is the only medicine especially
prepared for this purpose.
When a woman is troubled with pain
or weight in loins, backache, frequent,
painful or scalding urination, swelling
of ltmba or -feet, swelling under the
eyea, an uneasy, tired feeling in the
region of the kidneys or notices a. brick-
dust sediment in the urine, she should
lose no time in commencing treatment
with Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound, as it may be the means of
saring her life. %
For proof, read what Lydia B. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound did for Mrs.
Sawyer.
" I cannot express the terrible suffering I
had to endure. A derangement of the female
organs developed nervous prostration and a
serious kidney trouble. The doctor attended
me for a year, but I kept petting worse, until
I was unable to do anything, and I made up
my mind I could not five. I finally decided
to try Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound as a last resort, and I am to-day a well
woman. I cannot praise it too highly, and I
tell every suffering woman about my case."

LAURA BRIDE POWERS
It was a goodly company that gath
ered last night in the Institute of Art
on the hill â -the Acropolis of the town
-r^to formally open the Autumn Water
Colqr and Sketch Exhibition.
It isn't, of course, the Spring ExhN
bition, but it proved a very satisfac^
tory Full display, with. a lot of very
good things and- markedly few very
bad tilings. â¢ \u25a0
The display reveals much growth
among the lesser folk and retrogres
sion among the greaterâ either retro
gression or indifference, or perhaps 'tis
both.
The water colors that stand out in
the display are the following: C. P,
Neilgon's 229. Harrison Flshqr's 203,
Gordon Coutts' 226, Willis E. Davis' 228,
Eugene Neuhaus'. 244, Charlotte Knud
sen's 243, Helen" Clark Chandler's 233
and Fred W. Schults's "Peccavi," 257.
; Among the sketches in oil are some
smashing good things,' notably ;u por-'
trait by Matteo Sandona (341), quite
the best thing â .tho most comprehen
alve ir thing-~this sensitive young paint
er has yet done.
In the same line of quality are can
vases by Willis E. Davis (263), Bertha
Stringer Lee (300), X.ilUe V. O'Hyan
(sketch of William Keith), Julie Iley
nemnnn (309). William 11. Wilko (311),
Joseph Oreenbaum (317), Olga M. Ack
crmun (340 and ZiQ), Oqlseppc Caden
asso (36D), Ada Homer Shawhun (366).
In chalk and black und white mo
dlums, good specimens are shown by
Albert lne Jtandall WJieelan, Mary C.
Brady, Ada Romer Shawhan, Helen
Clark Chandler. Anno M. Breraer and
E. Almond Withrow. 9
Unfortunately the miniatures arc
huddled up in tho mezzanine gullery,
where they look awfully, lonesome. As
some of them arc good that may ac
count for their lonespmeness.
These good onesâ and only one or
two In the: Jot are really reprehensible
â¢-are Llllle V. O"Ryan's portraits of
Mrs. Dan Q'Cs.l Jaghan, Mrs. Winifred

son's ."Joaauin Miller.". . '
jVb an adjunct to the exhibition,. la
a very Interesting display of ceramics
by well-known townspeople. '
Altogether the exhibition Jis full . of
Interest to those who watch the evolu
tion of painters and .of exhibitions.

executive committee before the Inter-
Church Conference 'on "Federation In the
Carnegie Hall was the. first business taken
up by that body to-day. The report was
In part as follows:
The committee desires to emphasize the fact
that the source ef the movements toward fed
erations which has resulted in tho asMmbling
of'thl* eonffrenca la in be found In the grow-
Ing fraternal feeling between the different
Christian churchos ; of the country and in 'the
widespread desire for \u25a0 concerted â¢ actton ,In
Christian work with a view to the spiritual
â¢welfare of -.the nation and the world. There
can 1)8 no question that the churches rÂ«piÂ«r
6Â«nted here are In substantial unity upon thn
fundamental doctrines Qf the Christian religion
und also upon the general principles of admin
istrative policy as to \ the work of the kingdom
of Christ, both at home and abroad. . The com
mittee j cherishes tjie hopfi that whatever ia
done- by the conference will result In bringing
the qhiircbes yet -nearer- in ties af fraternity

loyalty to the great head of. "the church uni

The Real Marketplace
Cln McClur c*s Magazine
for November there is
the greatest assembling of
great industries, represented in*
the fprm of advertising, ever
found in one magazine. This
is one reason why McQureV
is called the .^marketplace' of T \u25a0 '
the wprld," but the other rea- .
son is because ]in its pages are i
*f threshed out the great prob-
lems of the marketplaceâ the
great question of business
honesty.
McClureV demands that
â¢ business shall be done on the
. high plane of simple honesty.
It lives up to that in its own
business pages by insisting
that no article shall be offered
for sale that its editors cannot \
personally recommend to their
. friends. This , bars patent
medicines, whiskies, cigarettes,
and investments that promise
more than any legitimate in- .
vestment ought to promise.

A^ k Men
If you want to be a strong, husky
fellow, with lots of steam in your
pipes, you ought to read my book on
the subject of physical development.
My business is making men strong,
especially those men who have
thrown away their strength by ex-
cesses, overwork and dissipation. My
electric belt is making such men
happy every day.
Every, man who is weak and "coins
back"- knows that there ought to be
pomething: that will restore that old
"Â»steam" to his physical body. He has
tried the usual drug method and found
that a fizzle, and yet he knows there
must be something:.
I know it, too, and I've got it. It's
Electricity. You can't name anythina
more likely to have that force which a
weak man lacks. . It's a natural power.
I, can -pump, it into a weak man while
he sleeps and make him feel like a San-
dow in- no time. It's the spice of life
I want you to readmy.book and learn
the truth about, my arguments. If you
are not as vigorous as you would like
to be, if you have rheumatic - pains,
weak kidneys, loss of. vitality, prostatic
troubles, nervous spells, varicocele or
any ailment of that 'kind that weakens
you. It would assure you future happi-
ness if. you would look Into this method
of mine. Don't. delay, it, your best days
are clipping by. If you want this book
I send it, closely sealed, free. If you send

FITZ TRAINS AT ALAMEDA
CONFEDERATE EASILY BEATS BEARCATCHES
Cocksure Furnishes Another Surprise at Oaklahdj
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
: With two defeats staring him in the
face inside of four days, Garnet Fer
guson's mighty brown horse Bearcatcher
is tottering on -his pedestal and about to
fall.
Everybody looking for a little ham and
eg.? money at Oakland track yesterday
bet on the . Ferguson sprinter to win the
seven furlong run, fourth to be decided,
simply because he had nothing to beat.
At least, that was the supposition.
It looked such a parade that the ring
would lay but 9 to 20 around post time,
and that's as tigHt as coin was at the
Lewis & Clark Exposition trail. . Among
the other three starters was Confederate,
introduced for the first time by Walter
Jennings.
It must be said the two-year-old left
a lasting impression and a feeling of va
cancy in the â¢ minds of many present.
The stupefying part of. it all Is, that
Owner Jennings possessed . the temerity
to bet on Confederate at odds of 3 and
4 to L As it was necessary to do ninety
four pounds and "Big Bill" Knapp has
discarded short breeches Radtke rode
Confederate. . \u25a0''*\u25a0'.
CONFEDERATE OUT IXFROXT.
He made no bones about his intentions.
Passing Retropaw early in the game he
see-sawed along '. down the. back stretch
with- the favorite and when the stretch
was reached held, the trump hand.
Wright drew the whip on Bearcatcher
but there was only faint response and
Confederate, drawing away, won by four
lengths easily, in 1:26%. Retropaw ran
an ordinary third. .. ;â¢ â¢
Although Avonalis, Magrane and Bear
catcher broke the slate, three other
choices came through, and the bookmak
ers failed to lay up much. The card did
not wear a particularly enticing look, still
it drew a good sized crowd over the bay.
"Big Bill" Knapp took the opening event
with Pickaway. the favorite. It was a flve
furlong dash, with the scale of weights
raised ten pounds. The Piccolo gelding
downed Edinborough and Blumenthal
without effort Yo San ran a close fourth
after a mishap at the post.
FAVORITE RUXS THIRD.
The talent flayed Avonalis down to even
money favoritism in the betting on the
two-year-old scramble, and she finished
third. Radtke, astride Cocksure, a Him
yar youngster from the Keene stable, and
15' to 1, Jumped away in the lead at the
start and forgot to back up. Jlllette, the
Ezell entry, led the favorite out a head
for the place.
Billy Magrane's four-year-old Magrane
furnished the entire show in the six and a
half furlongs sketch. There was a con
sistent play on him at 4 to 1 and less, and
he disposed of Romaine, the favorite, un
der half headway. Christine A blew up
and Pontotoo grabbed show, honors.
Likewise did the mile selling purse go to
Billy Magrane. Ed Lilburn, another from
his stable, came out favorite at 6 to 5,' and
in a fierce drive beat Byronerdale a head.
Cloche dOr, a 50 to 1 outsider, ran third.
James Nealon' s Callaghan ran. away
with the final mile~ purse fixture. There
was nothing In the race capable of ex
tending the good colt and he won buck-
Jumping from Firm Foot and Tramway.
XOTES OF THE TRACK.
Loasrue and Radtke divided the sad
dle honors, each piloting two winners.
According- to the racing: rules of the
Pacific Jockey Club the contract-hold
er on a rider's services must be -either
an owner or a trainer of i horses. .
Dan Mclntosh holds a contract on
the services of Loagrue. The boy is in
demand now and overtures have been
made to him by several horsemen. The
chances are Dan will become an owner
to-day.
. Willie Cross will also be compelled
to give up making erigagrementÃ for
Prior unless be becomes an owner or
trainer.
The Burns & Waterhouse year
lings, which are pronounced a splen
did lot, will be sold on December 7 by
Dalziel & Chase at 1732 Market street.
They are the progeny- of Altamax,
Colonel Wheeler, imported Galveston
and First Tenor.
The . yearlings from John Mackey's
stud farm near Woodland will be sold
to-night at Chase's sales yard on Mar
ket street.

The Giants cannot be beaten by the
Seals.- They seem to be able to go as
far as they like 'and still get away with
the winning end of the score. They
made their third straight winning
streak at Recreation Park yesterday
without a break, and they turned ,ithe
trick without doing' any strong work.
The Seals looked troublesome in the
final spasm, but they made only one
run. As they needed three to tie up the
result, there was no chance.
To Jakey Atz goes the credit of ; the
Portland victory. ' The little German
shortstop was* everywhere on that field
and he pulled off stops that looked ut
terly impossible for any ball player. He
had thirteen' chances, and though he
erred on two of them his work was so
grand the fans forgot about those two
mistakes. |
Atz figured in two fast double plays
.with Schafley and Mitchell, all - of
which counted against the Seals.
Neither of these would have been made
had not Jakey grabbed the ball at the
right time. He was all over the field
and Schafley took his throws cleverly,
which also helped some. \
/Portland' broke, up the game in the
seventh inning, when the. score was a
tie and it looked like extra innings.
Then Wheeler's â¢ offerings suddenly be
gan to look easy to the Giants. George
made his first mistake by passing Mc-
Creedie and his second by throwing an
easy one to Sweeney, who clouted the
ball for | a double- to left that brought
Mac in: Garvin tore through with a
single and Sweeney trotted home. Gar
vin was thrown out trying to steal sec
ond. Atz responded with a hit, and
Van Buren had a two-bagger. At this
Juncture Wheeler executed a wild pitch,
which let Atz come along with the
third run for the disastrous inning.
The Seals piled up a. full house in the
ninth when Wilson and Wheeler hit and
Waldron got a base on balls. <Mohler
smashed out a single td center, but Nea
lon and Hildebrand died without doing
any good, so the Seals had to quit with
the bases full. The score:

THE LANKY ONE
Cormsliinan Will Soon Show
: %lietlier He Will Stand
the^ Strain of Training
KAUFMANN MAY ASSIST
Billy- Delaney Offers the
Services of His Big''Pro
tege as a Sparring Mate
; Bob . Fitzsimmons will soon sottle tha
question whether he will be able to stand
a severe course of training. The big
Cornlshman, with hia retinue of trainers
and handlers, will begin at Alameda to
day the siege of. getting in shape for his
coming battle" with Jack O'Brien before
the Yosemite Club near the end of next
month. He Is back at Croll's Garden^
where ho trained before.
After a thorough canvass of the differ
ent training quarters in the vicinity of
this city Fitz and hia manager decided
that the Alameda resort was the . proper
place for them. They packed their bag
gage yesterday and took up lodgings at
the training" camp across the bay, and
active work will commence this morning.
Fitzsimmons has secured the services of
Harry Foley, the middleweight, who will
assist him in his Work. Foley \u25a0will prob
ably join the camp to-day.
Billy Delaney has off ered â the services
of his protege, Al Kaufmann, to the for
mer champion, and It is possible the for
mer Olympic Club man will be swappiiig
punches with the Cornishman within the
next few days. It will be an excellent
opportunity for Kaufmann to learn some
of the finer points of the game by boxing
with a man like Fitzsimmons. Kaufmann
may also be able to, impart to Fitz some
of his knowledge of how O'Brien fights,
owing to the experience he had with the
Philadelphian in their recent combat.
.O'Brien will hold down the training
camp at Sheehan's Tavern, where he has
been since he arrived' here. He will not
go into active work^for a few days, as he
is at present in good shape.

with Battling Nelson will not be so
bright after their contest on the 24th
Inst. Sullivan says he is sure ne will
win from Gardner and this will forever
put an end to Jimmy's hopes of getting
on with the Dane. If Mike's battles in
the past and his present good.condi
tion count for anything Gardner's pros
pects for a chance at Nelson arc none
too rosy.
Sullivan has decided that too much
boxing at the finish of his training
would be courting a mishap and he has
changed his programme of work. Box
ing will be done every other day from
now up to and including Tuesday, when
the gloves will be discarded altogether.
Yesterday Sullivan . and his brother
Dave did a lot of sprinting along the
Marin County roads and In the after
noon Â»he worked for fifty minutes in the
gymnasium. Mike weighed 137 pounds
when he had finished the day's work.
Jimmy Gardner put in a hard day
over in Alameda and his trainers were
compelled to call a halt in the work,
fearing their charge might do too much.
Gardner knows he has a hard battle
ahead and he is working: as he never
worked before. His boxing yesterday
consisted of four rounds with Joe An
geli. Â«
NELSON MAY FIGHT McGOVERX.
Managers Confer Regarding a Match
â¢ : Before Some Philadelphia Club.
NEW YORK, Nov. 16.â After a con
sultation lasting more than an hour to
night Billy Nolan, manager, of Battling
Nelson, and Joe Humphreys, who has
charge of Terry McGovern, parted com
pany without signing their men for a
fight. Many clubs and offers were dis
cussed. Humphreys favored the Na
tional Athletic -Club of Philadelphia as
being the best place for a fight. Nolan
refused this offer,, claiming the club
did not possess seating capacity neces
sary for a crowd large enough to make
the contest a paying proposition to the
fighters.
He suggested several other clubs that
had made good offers, laying special
stress on the proposition - from the
Tuxedo Club of Philadelphia, which Is
being . built ; by Billy, Rocap, from whom
he received an offer of $2500 guarantee.
Humphreys would not agree to sign
articles with this club.. The -managers
will confer again either on , Saturday
or Monday, when it is likely they will
come to some agreement,^BijS|

Harbor Commissioners Ask
Southern Paciiic to Tie
Up Unmanageable Craft
With about 18,000 tons of cargo and
more than 1100 souls on board the Pa
cific Mail liner Mongolia, Captain \V.
P. 6. Porter, sailed yesterday for the
Orient. Her cargo consists principally
of machinery and most of it is for
Japan.
She carried 235 cabin passengers, 40
*.n the steerage, SBO Chinese and 200
Japanese. The Mongolia's crew num
bers 320. The total number of people
on board is 1175.
The liner was a little late in getting
away, owing: to the usual tardiness of
â¢what is known as the "office mail."
When her lines were cast off she made
a pretty departure, which seemed to
meet the approval of General Agent
Alexander Center, who was there with
liis magnetic smile to dispatch the
heavily laden liner.

Want Car Float Tied Up.
Some little time ago "William McKenzie. su
perintendent of the Southern Pacific ferry
â¢tettners, designed a freight car float which
xras a combination of lighter and stern-wheel
\u25a0teamer, the wheel and engines of an old ;
river boat beins; installed on one of the light
era orevlously hauled about by a towboat.
Any o? the ferry-boat pilots could have told
McKenrie that the craft would not steer as
the rudders were originally arranged. The
boat wes christened S. P. Car Float No. 2. It
\u25a0was launched and, without a trial trip, placed
in commission. AÂ« McKenzie had been told,
it" rudders did not act and the float's first
trio was In a straight line to the bank or
Oakland Creek, where it grounded. The float
vas replaced on the ways and wheel and rud
ders were rearranged. This was coxae months
ngo. The McKenzie float . haÂ» been busy ever
plnce. Just how baay Is best told in a report
made at yesterday's meeting of the Harbor
Commissioners by Engineer Lott Norton, who
â¢aid: /
"go-Jtfaern Pacific car float Ho. 2 has dam
aged the car ferry . Blln at Central basin so
often and to erich an extent that I Instituted
an investigation. - I find tnat the float is un
contruUsible and ask that the ' Southern Pacific
be reauested either to discontinue its use or
to maintain the clip at their own expense."
Tte railroad company will toe so notified.
The Crane Comwny wm granted by the
Harbor Commissioners the use of part of State
lot No 3. This property Is seventy-five feet
wide and extends along North Point street be
tween Dtipont and East. The company wants
it 'or the purpose of laying a Epur track
conm-ctlne with UÂ»e belt railroad to a ware
house they . propose to erect on the land. The
track, which will cost 51370. -will be built by

JuÂ«lse Coffey : Refunes to Dismiss .Con-
test on Ground That Contestant
Is . Poor.
>\u25a0\u25a0 The? contest of the will of the late
Honora : - Sharp," instituted by. James
O'Donnell, *a v cousin : of ; the deceased,
was "set" yesterday for -trial ;"' on ".No
vember 28. The order directing that*
the .contestant- proceed- on that date
was ' made by. Superior Judge Coffey.
.When the motion to set the case for
trial was made before Judge j Coffey
Attorney Charles S. Wheeler, represent
ing ; the i proponents of the will, asked
that - the contest be ruled ; out of court
on the' ground ' that l the contestant had
advanced none of the sum of $350 that
had been expended in taking deposi
tions. Attorney Houx j objected to such
a 'proceeding, : stating' that his client
was .poor and; unable to shoulder any
of : the^expenses. . . . . ;
' ''Because. a man is poor it is no rea
son why he should be barred from a
court of justice/!, said Judge â¢ Coffey.
"The Idea is repugnant to me. He
should [not be thrown out of court tfe
causehe has no means.". |
Attorney Wheeler withdrew his mo
tion, but reserved the right to charge
for the depositions In a bill of costs
to be filed- later.

The Money Market,
HÂ«r.ry Clews of New York tays of the Mon^y
market, under date of November 11, when
Dtmlan conditions n-ere much more composed
than at present:
â¢'The iocal money market is still threatened
with pold csiorts, and large sums are due
to Japan en account of its loans, which
v.-jl! bo transmitted at the first favorable op
portunity. In tact, there is a strong pre
\u25a0moptloa that remittances for this account
tire already being quietly made. The Rus
sian situation also strengthens the probabil
ities of a largo Russian loan. Ilutnor stated
thai this had been postponed until February
or March, but should the Government suc
ceed in renorlng ordÂ«;r ana putting proposed
rtfomis i'stj *Â»arly effect the loan wlil piob
ftbly be placed btfore that date. With for-
bankers it Is merely a question of an
opportune monwr.t fiÂ»r placing this loan: anJ,
being a'.rtaUy heavily committed to Russian
obMsailoÃS, it is to their iuterest to ttrength
en the Russian Government financially without
\u25a0unnecessary delay. For this reason the for
*-iÂ£ii bankers may begin to draw upon Ameri
can *:g:j as soon a.Â« our local stringency abater.
I'ari* is strong from a monetary standpoint and
could roa.iiily provide its share of subscrip
tion*. London, however, might want assist
ance, erd the German banks wtll certainly bo
ObUjgttl to Etrengrhen their gold (supplies at our
fxt*mse. far as New York Is concerned

\:ia=:J*.uch a* it gives ample time for prepara-
L - ;okf. t- Â» wÂ«U a* perruittir^; the natural rtâ
ii.m of funds from the interior to this cen

"During the next few weeks firm rates
must be anticipated for money, the market

manipulations owing to the actual scarcity
<if funds. Business continues active and a
high level of prices for commodities as well
as securities tends to aggravate stringency
sir.cc larger turns are required to perform a

are pomtwhat conflicting. Funds have been
it-turning after crop-moving requirements, but,
on the other hand, large shipments have been
niade to the interior for mercantile and other
purposes In the West high rates fur money

New Tork wires to E. F. Hutton & Co.
yesterday said :
"Tho Vlolart rise In the foreign exchange
market of nearly half a cent in the pound
t â¢_.â¢.-. i!:p to the I asis of $4 t>'j for bill* was
tiie most noteworthy feature of the day and
it helped to brlr.g about the late sharp re
action' in the general market as it Is within
%c of the rats at which gold might be ex
ported. The revolution in Russia of a general
character is now so menacing that it is qu:tÂ«
possible that the foreigners have begun t<>
withdraw Â»ome of their balances in anticipa
tion of a break in oÂ«r market *t Paris, where
two and a half billion dollars of Russian
government and industrial bonds are bein*
kept. This is now* the worst situation con*
fronting the local market and it should b.
\u25a0watched. It seems that if It Is not tight
rnonÂ«y it is something Â«-lse to unsettle the mar
ket. Foreirn news Is disturbing and fears
ere expressed that this old Â»ore spot is to r>*
reopened. The close is unsettled and nervou*
and the immediate future Of the market will
lÂ«Â» governed largely by the tone of markets
abroad and news to come from that part of thfe

NEW YORK. Xcv. 10 â Conditions in the
money Riarkct showed evidence to-day of a
rapid return to the normal, an J active and
very irregular speculative operations in stocka
were resumed accordingly. The further re
tr*rat ol the bear element by covering of eborta
was an SiEDortsnt element in the market, and
the truest aggrespive operations egalnst them
continued to lie in Â»o<^:lal stock* which are
credited with betss Jarcely In the hands of
t-xlt?. The movements In some cf this c!Â£se
became m violent aÂ« to unKettlc confidence
i-Fe:*:. There was considerable normal profit
taking, induced by the wide recoveries from
the week* low prtct-B. Alarminc reports of
conditJcnÃ in Russia and the great strength of
foreign exohansre caused the abru&t break in
the late market. The opening rate for rail
money showed the easier conditions exlMlng
in that- department by the 7% per cent rate.
The rate touched 8 per cent only momentarily
and receded eteadily to B per cent, while loans
were â¢till actively swing on. The premium
which aaÂ» been exacted on time loans for thort
l*Hiods also disappeared and the tcne for that
department waÂ« alao easier. The wesence in
itreV acaln of the Secretary of the
waÂ« made the occasion . for repeated
rutr.cra of an Intention to take meanures to
relieve the money market, and when it waÂ»
announced later in the day that the Secretary
had determined to return to Washington spec*
ulatlve <iÂ«cusFlon readily turned to the ccn
clueion that this indicated relief from any fur
ther fipprehenson or threatening conditions in
the money market. Actual developments polnt
cl to a cessation cf the drain on the cash re
serve* of the hank? , thus relieving them of the
reewseity of a corUlnuiiiK loan contraction to
keep pace with a further shrinkage in reserves.
The Sub-Treasury for two dayÂ» now has con
tributed a. small mint to the money market in
Â»t*-ad of â¢ \u25a0withdrawal. A more Imuortant de- \u25a0
veloprnent w-cÂ»w -cÂ» tb* rlÂ«e at a xrumber of points

THE COPPER STOCKS.
BOSTON, Nov. 10. â The copper market
opened strong all through the list, with N<*w
York apparently a heavy buyer of copper
stocks, especially United States Mining, Nt>r'h
Butte and Boston Consolidated. Optra tors feel
very confident of the metal situation and pre
dict higher prices for the good-producing
mines, / but in the near future think money
uncertainties and poo! manipulation will make
an erratic market.

JAMES C CRAWFORD
At the Harbor police station they are
Invariably alluded to as "The Water
front Twins." but on Judgre Mogan's
calendar they were registered as
James Ward and James Fitzpatrlck.
The charge against them was that of
vagrancy, and Patrolman Dower, who
arrested them, declared that their ffuilt
of said offense was of many years'
standing.
It has been the dally wont of
Messrs. Ward and Fitzpatrick, the of
ficer went on to narrate, to Bit upon
the edge of a wooden water trough
at East and Market streets and there
solicit alms from folk hurrying to or
from the ferry station. So lazy were
the two able-bodied fellows that they
did not even leave their perch to beg,
but summoned to them such pedes
trians as they singled out for solici
tation. Regardless of how fast the
chosen victim was hastening or how
brief the time in which he had to
"make the boat." Mr. Ward and Mr.
Fitzpatrick loudly and earnestly Im
portuned him to stop and listen to
their stereotyped and absolutely false
t&le of misfortune.
"Step dis "way. good gent." was their
\u25a0whining petition, "an* hep ehlong a
couple o' pore mug* wat hez bin ship
wrecked an* lost all der duds an' can't
get anudder ship. Hep de pore an' un
fortnlt mariners."
All monetary contribution thus ob
tained by the twain were spent for
cteam beer, the policeman added, and
when cash failed to reach them they
drained empty kegs for their bever
ege. At night they vanished and It
was generally believed that they
wooed Morpheus under one of the
wharves.
One of the court bailiffs then in
formed the Judge that Mr. Fitzpatrick
tras the subject of a 'longshore story
that served to Illustrate both his
chronic laziness and adamantine cheek.
Ere he became associated In mendi
cancy with Mr. Ward it had been Mr.
Fitzpatrick's all-day custom to lean
against a certain building while he
begged, and when the structure was
condemned as unsafe and ordered
razed he threatened to sue the con
tractor for depriving him of his means
of support.
The two vagabonds will be sen
tenced to-day.
Mrs. Susan B. Clark's divorced hus
band had been arrested and punished
on several occasions for battering her.
and two weeks ago he celebrated his
release from prison, where he had
served two months, by proceeding to
beat her, when she turned the tables
by hurling a glass at his head with
euch force and accuracy of *alm that
he has been confined to the hospital
ever since. She was arrested and
charged with having committed an as
sault with a deadly weapon, but after
bearing the facts yesterday Judge Ca
baniss dismissed her without further
hearing.
"But what will I do If he comes
after me when he gets out of hos
pital?" inquired Mrs. Clark. "He ain't
afraid of Jail/
"Well, you stopped him the last time
he wejit after you," said the Judge
significantly.
Mrs. Clark nodded. Bmlled and with
drew' from the presence.
Edward Ballien, arrested for working
a lame horse at the fish market, told
Judge Conlan that If the animal were al
lowed to stand still ten minutes it would
bÂ« crippled for ten minutes after It
started to walk, but gradually it attained
a very graceful gait.
"If such is the case." quoth the Judge,
*'you should never have permitted the
horse to stand still, and I must find you
guilty of cruelty by neglecting to keep the
beast constantly moving."
"EVs yo* duty, Jedge." said Misa Lot
tie Gonzales (chocolate hued) to his
Honor Fritz, "t reppaman* dese yah cops

Conlan this case would better be trans
ferred to his court,"" was the response,
and transferred it was.
"De ahdea," said Miss Gonzales to
Judge Conlan, "ob .my ' bein' : 'rested

fust case eghenst me am pufflckly ri
dlckylousâdoan yo' think so?" j
"I think you're guilty twice," was "the
disappointing answer, "and to-morrow
I'll sentence you twice." â¢
"Fo" de \u25a0 Lo'd sek,. den, tell me ' wat
protection p'obation gives a pusson," Miss
â¢Gonzales demanded.
The Judge heeded her not.
Mrs. Annie Cronin was arrested by Cap
tain -Spillane for drunkenness at 1 o'clock
Wednesday afternoon on Market street,
and she was released on $10 bail. . Exactly
tweleve hours later, she was 'arrested by
Patrolmen Cramer and Wren for drunk
enness on the Barbary. Coast, and both
charges were against her on Judge Mo
gan's calendar..
"It was all the same drunk." said Mrs.
Cronin, "and I don't see how you're going
to cinch me twice for it."
. His Honor gave himself till this morn
ing to think it over. .
Illustrative of the flexibility of the San
Francisco vagrancy ordinance was the ar
rest and booking of John F. Bush on that
charge. He dwells ajt 1626 Dupont street
and owns considerable real and personal
property, yet he was arrested as a va
grant on complaint of his wife, Sarah,
who swore that . for the last five years
he has been an idler and has not "drawn
a sober breath" since, last July. Neither
she nor any of their six children is suf
fering for want- of life's necessaries be
cause of his conduct, but he. is a house
hold nuisance and , his suppression Is
prayed for. \u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0 '\u25a0 , - ?
Judge Mogan did â¢ not doubt that the
vagrancy charge would adhere, but he or
dered that an additonal accusation of bat
tery be entered against the defendant,
and promised to hear both -'cases to-day.
Edward H. Arnold, proprietor of Ar
nold's Dairy, -was sentenced by , Judge
Mogan to pay, a fine of $20 for having

- Jesse L.eroy, a self-avowed capitalist,
playwright and man of all-round capa
bility, "has disappeared from view, leav
ing his wife penniless and on-the mercy
of strangers.' - According to Mrs. Le
roy,-they were, married in Reno, Xev.,
last June, the bride at that time keep
ing a boarding-house. With larse tales
of wealthand prosperity. Leroy per
suaded the landlady- into matrimony,
also that she resign all her personal
goods .\u25a0'-Into'" his tender care to be well
protected;
Several weeks ago the Reno hostelry
was dissolved, Mr. and Mrs. Leroy com
ing to San Francisco, half a dozen
trunks constituting- their baggage.
These belong to -Mrs. Leroy and were
put off at Oakland, where a daughter
of Mrs. Leroy resides.
Failure of ' the trunks to arrive on
this.side of the bay, was attributed by
Mr. Leroy to their being detained at
the baggage-room. Monday night Lie
roy failed- to return to the, rooms he
and his wife have been occupying 1 on
Twenty-fourth street. and nothing has
been heard of him since. Mrs. Leroy,
in summing up the past four or five
months, states that her suspicions are
seriously aroused as to her husband's
conduct and this. . together with her
statement- that her trunks have been
broken into and divested of all jewelry
and marketable articles, makes her feel
that she has been duped and deserted.
She is in need of. aid and eager to
work, having a: ten-year-old daughter
to support. - > -
