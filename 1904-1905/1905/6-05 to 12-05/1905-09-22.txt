cheered. 1 the delegates
Hickey said, in part:
I thank you lor the honor you have con
ferred upon me. To me and to every man
mho read* the hUtory of the Democratic party
thr o Woe of chairman of a Democratic con
vection Is In truth an exalted station. But
I em* conscious that it iÂ» not alone as an
honor to me that the post has beta conferred,
but to the Thirtieth District, trom which 1
come. It Is not only the mo6t loyal districv
In the ranks of the party, but it has the
largest number of democratic voters in tnÂ»
city. Two years aso it was my prfvUere to
preside over oÂ»e oÂ£ the most turbulent con
vention, held In San Francisco within a
decade not excepting the rovrdy exhibition of
last Tuesday night at the Ailuuabra. Demo
crats ask but one thins from a chairman.
And that is fair play. I sought to rive ever>
man- fair play, and It is my â¢ pride tl J at ,. l
received commendation from both the majority
and the minority alike. I am the candidate
at no faction, the champion of no candidate,
and although I admit liability to. error, it is
my purpose to rive fair play to all.
The city of San Francisco U stepping out of
a condition of provincialism Into tier place
as one of the great cities of ' the ' world. Now
if the time to lay the lines of development
of our future ereatness and tho*e lines must
bÂ» laid not only for financial and commercial
prosperity, but lor a ; c!ean, honest- adminis
tration of the great metropolis' affairs.
Wisely have we began to prepare for thÂ«
future. We hare voted millions of dollars foÂ»
the improvements of the municipality. But
municipal officials hold In thÂ« palms of their
hands the future greatness of San Francisco,
and tbbse men who are to handle and dis
burse this vaet rum for the betterment ' ot
the public ought to be. at least, honest men.
Aod If those of fleers are men nominated by
thlÂ» convention they must, i they shall .he hon
est men. Our position is peculiarly ; fortunate
and gratifying. Democracy has won the con
fidence of the great body of citlrens who vote
and will Â»ot abuse their trust.
WILL SAVE THE CITY.
The emergency that we face at this time
Is greater than a party or a man. .The ap
proaching campaign will be a battle fast and
turious to save the city of San Francisco
from corruption and degradation. A clean
government, an- honest administration of mu
nicipal affairs, and the ouetJng of the spoils
men are the objects of this tight to restore
the good name of the city. We demand and
wlir receive the support of all' good citizens
who with to save San Francisco ifrom .tne
hands of her despcllers.
The Â£houtt> or approval that greeted I
the conclusion of Chairman iile key's
address made it apparent that he had
struck the keynote that means the
downfi.ll of corruption.
Nominations for temporary secretary
were next called for and Eustace Cul
llnan took the platform and named W.
li. McCarthy for the office. There was:
no other nomination and McCarthy was
elected by acclamation. McCarthy was
called wi>on for an address. He said
he fcad work to do that needed his at
tention and that furthermore he could
see no hotter way of expressing his ap
preciation for the honor that had been
conferred upon him than to refrain
from inflicting an address upon the con
vention. "However, you have heard the
eloquent address of the cliairman," con
cluded McCarthy, "and 1 want to tell
you that anything Hickey says goea
double." i
. Cullinan moved that as there were no
contests for seat* that the committee on
credentials be dispensed with and that
the temporary officers be made perma
nent. The motion carried.
v William At. Cannon moved that a
committee of eighteen, one from, each
Assembly district, be named to prepare
tne platform aud edit the resolutions.
Uls motion carried, as did onÂ«s by Al
bert M. Johnson providing for a sim
ilar committee on order of business.
WILL NAME SUPERVISORS.
1 OFgood Putnam of the Forty-fourth
moved that a committee of seven be
appointed to .select candidates for Su
pervisors. The motion carried. J. R.
J*rlng;le then presented for the consid
eration of the convention the resolution
providing for fusion with the Repub
lican party and for the appointment of
a committee of five to arrange the de
tails of the proposed fusion. The reso
lution was adopted ,with but one dis
senting vote, and that was cast in Jest.
Hut the one lone "Xo" gave the Schmlts
heelers, headed by Commissioner of
Works v Tom Earan. a chance to release
a Ehout of Approval. . The hoodlums
subsided, however, with the first crash
of the chairman's gavel on the- plate of
boiler Iron that had been supplied for
Just such an emergency.
â¢ Hugo K. Asber then -moved that the
convention adjourn to the call of the
chair. Before Chairman Hickey could
j>ut the motion, however. Eagan in
structed his gang of toughs to "start
things." V.'ith a howl his followers
obeyed and it was fully a mmute before
the uproar subsided.
r ,'"l see it Is the intention to treat us
â¢with a dose of the rowdyism, that was
Inflicted on the Republican convention,"
*ald Hickey. "but we'll soon., put -a stop
to this.** . â¢ _ . .

The Republican Municipal

that John S. Partridge will be nominated

The organization committee of the San

terday afternoon at 636 Market street and
conferred with; party representatives of
the Thirty-sixth and Thirty-eighth As

Fred Eggers will /- be recommended . for
nomination to the office of Tax Collector.

The Chief of Police may receive the
advice of capable counsel to the effect
that delegates to a convention through
regularly authorized : committees may
regulate admission of spectators. The
committees engage the halls, ' pay the
rent and reserve places for delegates and
attaches. ; Spectators may be admitted
freely or by tickets Issued to the various
delegations. " /
\u2666 Lawyers hold that : the police had no
more right to force tlje doors of the Al
hambra on Tuesday night for the admis
sion of a gang of outsiders than they
would have to force open the doors of the

It is the privilege of a convention, as it.
Is the right of a Legislature,' to go into'
executive session and exclude. from the
hall .all visitors and spectators. \The.no
tion that a convention hall is t a- -place
where ruffians may congregate- and create
confusion and riot . should no longer be
entertained by the "police authorities.

sembly About Completed
PEOMTJLGATION IS SURE
Press -Also Will Be Given
Freedom During the Com
ing National Campaign
ST. PETERSBURG. Sept. 22/3:10 a. m.-
The project for granting the Russian
people, under certain limitations, the right
of assembly for the 'discussion ofpolit leal
and economic questionsâ a reform sec
ond In importance only to the con v< ration
of the representative assembly and which
was elaborated by a commission under
the presidency. of Count Ignatieffâ is now
practically completed, and after a final
review by the SoLsky Commission on Sat
urday will ;be - immediately laid befora
Emperor Nicholas. Its promulgation LÂ»
confidently expected early next week.
\u25a0Though coupled with a" number of re
strictions designed to give the authorities
an oversight: of proceedings in order .to
prevent "discussion of treasonable or sedi
tious ; subjects, * this reform ; will mark a
great constitution]: development, : the peo
ple .hitherto'- haying -no general- right of
assemblyre;ceep.fatf meetings of authorized
sdde'Ues:*'.}. The"' privilege granted by the
Emperor's" rescript .of March S permitting
meetings ' f 6r_dlscU3s!on " of popular repre
sentation was :a - temporary - measure and
was 'withdrawn .when : the national as
sembly rescript -was! issued.' â¢ â¢
Under '\u25a0 the ; proposed regulations organ
izers'are required to give three days' no
tice of -.a '-meeting, and lv purposes. Spe
cial sanction for a meeting is not re
quired and .the possibility of bureaucratio
delays is 'thereby obviated, but the ' Go
vernment reserves ; the right to prohibit ob
jectionable .meetings and also the right to
have \ a ; representative to see that tha
discusslons'/do " not - overstep the limits.
This - representative : may \u25a0 demand the
names * and i addresses of : all the speakers
and , the -assembly : may be closed if the
speakers deviate, from "the announced pro
gramme/ or" IrTcase^af disorder. ,
The ' second pleading ..article of the bill
of rights demanded by the reformers will
make â¢\u25a0 popular representation truly suc
cessful, i This >relatesrt6' the freedom of
the press," and will 'probably not take tha
form of law at this juncture,- as the Gov
ernment -wishes . to â¢ submit the matter to
the national - assembly â¢ for Its- considera
tion. ! It!lshunderst6od,-however, that an'
informal announcement will be soon mada
to j thereff ect' that -the enforcement of tha
press", laws'' will -be â¢ relaxed \u25a0'- during thÂ©
campaign* so as to permit of ample dis
cussion iot: measures .and candidates. .It
is also understood that â¢ after . January 1
next representatives of the press will be
admlted to the . sessions of the ' council : of,
the- empire' so that publicity may be given
to the -proceedings of the upper, house of
the assembly.

had all been presented and ne was ready
to bring his case to a temporary close.
The fcudden closing of the prosecution
was a eurprlse to every one present.
This action was taken after the reading
cl a document v.hich Past Assistant Sur
geon Charles G. Smith had addressed to
the court. It was an opinion on the
pre&tnt condition of Enelgn Wade and his
present ability to stand a rigorous cross
exaxslnatlon. . The document was remark
able In that It was entirely opposed to
the opinion exprtstedby the came young
navy physician only three days ago. It
ed vised the court that Ensign Wade was
In such a serious condition that, it would
be dangerous to take h:s testimony for
a month. ',- .
Captain West was on his feet the ln-
Btant the letter was read. Anger and
astonishment were expressed \u25a0 upon his
features. He stated to the court that in
his opinion Dr. Smith should have con
elflered the court of sufficient Importance
to have given a reason for his'- eudden
change of base, as he had stated, when
directly examined on Tuesday, that the
patient would be sufficiently strong in a
few days to give his testimony. Captain
West expressed himself as surprised that
Lieutenant Evans, who is the legal repre
sentative of Ensign Wade, should have
appeared as assistant counsel for Com
mander Young, and that after this came
the change of opinion of Dr. Smith.
WILL WAIT FOR WADE.
Judge GÂ«orgÂ« E. Gear, for the defense,
proposed to continue the case without the
teetlcnony of Ensign Wade, but the prose
cution Insisted that the testimony of
Wade be taken tven though It delay the
proceedings. The court appeared to fa
vor the prosecution in the debate which
followed and an adjournment was taken
until to-morrow morning.
Aiiother bit of excitement occurred dur
ing. the . cross-examination of Lieutenant
Commander W. F. Bartlett by "JudgÂ«
Gear. The counsel for the defense asked
the. court- to request the witness to an
swer only the question asked and avoid
giving- hearsay evidence. The words were
barely out "of the mouth of Judge Gear
when Captain West ' rose : excitedly ahd
asked the court to. prevent Judge Gear
from attempting to keep out the truth
from the reccrfls by Interrupting the wit
ness wltn new questions beiore the an
swer to the previous Â«ne was finished.
For. a moment a lively tilt seemed. about
to take place, but . trouble was - avoided
and the proceedings resume*, their former
QUlet.
BAItTXETT O-V THE STAXO.
The testimony of Lieutenant Comman
der Bartlett was the most important evi
dence of the day. Bartlett is attached to
the -aicago and vas a member, of the
board &: investigation which met at San
Diego. immediately after the explosion on
the Bennington. He swore that he had
found the safety valves of boilers "A"
and "C" In good condition and that the
sentinel valves of all ue boilers were in a
bad way.
,He also showed that dust and .rust
anight have been blown into these' valves
by the force of the explosion, and cited
the appearance of asbestos there .as a
proof of this. Further, questioning along
this line was objected to by Captain West
as calling for an opinion merely, and his
objection was sustained.
Lieutenant A. ,F. Yates, executive of
ficer of the Bennington at the time of the
explosion, r was clopo^y^ questioned as to
his knowledge of the Inspections which
Commander Young made ' of his ship.
Yates' evidence was: rather damaging to
the defense, as he could not recall many,
tours of Inspection. The log books were
Introduced to show : that many Sunday
jnorrilng Inspections were not made , by.
Commander Young. s To offset this : evi
dence ; Commander,, Young-, will undoubt

BOMB THROWN UPON
STEPS OF TENE3IENT
<; Black Hand" Supposed to Be
Responsible for Attempt
to Destroy Lives.
NEW YORK. Sept. 21.â With a roar
that was heard for; blocks and one
which threw the occupants of an entire
neighborhood of densely crowded tene
ments Into a panic a dynamite bomb
was exploded early this morning; on
the steps of a ienement-house on' First
avenue. The neighborhood was shaken
as by an earthquake and scores of
sleepers were thrown from their beds.
That nobody was seriously injured ap
pears remarkable.
There are two stores on ,tnc ground
floor of the house. One Is a meat shop
kept by Henry Blumborg and the. other
Is a barber shop owned by'S. Scarlto.
Living on the other lloors were sixteen
families. Last Tuesday Scarito went to
police headquarters with a letter sent
to him signed "Black Hand." _fe said
It was the fourth he had received. A
demand had been made for $2000 In
cash, but It was not made clear to
whom or. where he. was -to pay the
money. The bomb which exploded this
morning was placed in his shop.
Policemen had all could do to
restore quiet ameng t@! frightened ten
ants who fled in a panic to the narrow
hallways leading from their quarters
and more than an hour elapsed before
they would go back to bed. Much
damage was done to tho doors, win
dows and woodwork, but. the house was
not damaged structurally.

With the entering of, the pleas the

While in Chicago the Attorney General

understanding that the jail provision of

INSURANCE COMPANIES
JUGGLE WITH BONDS.
QUEER DEALS EXPOSED
Prosecutor H ughes Traces Checks That
Are Given to Morgan's Firm.
NEW YORK, Sept. 21-<s*orge W. Per
kins, vice president of thfe New York Life
Insurance Company and a' member of the
firm of J. P. Morgan & Co., was on the
witness stand before the special legisla
tive committee probing insurance compa- 1
nles' methods during the greater part of
to-day'c session. When \u25a0an adjournment
was taken he was still on' the stand. With
a number of questions pending to reply
to, on which he asked permission to look
up the records and submit > transcriptions.
There was nothing of a sensational
character in the testimony to-day, the |
.only development , of moment being the j
disclosure of the transaction with the
-New Orleans traction syndicate, in which
the company sustained a loss of over,
ssoo.ooo. â¢ ;.*::.': , â¢.
Edmund V. Randolph, treasurer of the
company, had been questioned rather
sharply regarding this transaction when
he was on the Ftand last week. To-day
the matter was brought up again, when'
Counsel Hughes attempted to probe the
collateral loan account. The bonds of the
New Orleans Traction Company had been
bought from the New York Security and
.Trust Company at S5. and were subse
quently sold at 75. Mr. Perkins testified
that they were sold on December 31, 1903,
\o Fanshawe & Co. for $937,500. Hughes
found under date of January 5, 1905, a
loan of that amount to Fanshawe & Co.,
and asked if the loan was made against
those bonds. This Perkins said he would
have to look up. ' and the question was
dropped for the present. %\'\
â¢ PRODUCES BANK BOOK.
After recess Perkins resumed the stand
and produced a bank book of the New
York Life insurance Company : showing
the check for $266. and a deposit slip
thowmg the check raid the New York
Life Insurance Company for the neviga
tion bonds on December 31. 1903, by J. P.
Morgan & Co. The check for $266, Perkins
testified, was for two days with Interest
Et Â« per cent, which the New York Life
paid J. P. Morgan & Co. on the $800,000.
Hughes tried to bring out that the $$00,000
received from Morgan & Co. was taken
with the expectation that it would be paid
back, but Perkins would not acknowledge
it as a loan.
Hughes then passed to the list of
transactions of the New York 'Life Com T
pany with J. P. Morgan & Co.- On De
cember SL 1903, about $4,000,000 off bonds
were bought by the New York Life In
surance Company from J." P. Morgan &
Co. They appeared in the annual report
of the New York Life Insurance Com
pany. February 16 $2,000,000 of these bonds
\u25a0w ere sold back to J. P. Morgan & Co. for
the same price. Perkins could not explain
this, but would look it up. No minutes
of the finance committee on the subject
could be found. In the collateral loans
were two of $50,000 each to John R.. Hege
man. president of the Metropolitan Life
Insurance Company, at I*4 per cent Inter
est. One of these loans had been repaid.
The other, made January 2, 1902, was still
running. Perkins did not know whethejr
this matter came before the finance com
mittee, but would like to look it up.
MATTER OF IXTEREST.
The matter of the Interest on the $800,
000 check was taken up again and the
original warrant drawn for the payment
of $SOO,2^G was presented. It was signed
by the assistant treasurer. The, lnterest
was charged to *he expense accouÂ»t The
detailed statement of the purchases of
the New York Life Insurance Company
f roni J. P. Morgan & Co. since Perkins ;
has been, a member of that firm was pre
sented. His personal proms as a member
of the Morgan firm in dealings with * the
New York* Life Insurance Company were
$10,412. These profits were. Perkins said
last Friday, returned by personal check
to the New York Life Insurance Com
pany.
The matter of the New Orleans traction
syndicate and the $1,275,000 bonds that
were purchased from the New York
Becurity and Trust Company was gone
Into. The New York Life Insurance Com
pany sustained a loss on this transaction
of over $300,0y0. Perkins said it iWas not |
a safe investment, but he denied that the
bonds were purchased by the New York
Life Insurance Company from the New
York Security and Trust Company to pro
tect the latter company. .
Mr. Randolph, the treasurer, has al
ready testified that these were -sold to
Fanshawe & Co., and .that the sale was
accompanied by an agreement to. protect
the purchaser. Hughes tried to find out
where the mbney received for these bonds,
was credited. The, sum involved was
$927,500. Hughes unearthed a loan of
$937,500 to Fanshawe & .Co., January 5,
I&is, but Perkins pleaded he was not a
bookkeeper and would have to look into
this further. He was asked:
"Did fyou, on December. 31, 1903, sell
these bonds to Fanshawe & Co., and
then, on January 2, loan them this, money
against tlie botide?".: .' ~ .
"That I'll have, to look up." 1 replied
Perkins. , . ;.;. ';,*, '.
Perkins did not know whether this mat
ter came before the finance, committee,
and would also look that .up. Witness
could not explain why af ter " the ' New
York Life had bought $4,000,000 worth of
bonds from J. P. Morgan & Co., $2,000,000
worth should be sold back to that - firm
at the Eame price within two* months,
and no minutes of the finance committee
could be found to explain it. r

case"
Dr. J. L Stephen suspended chief
surgeon of the emergency service,
writhed and twisted on the stand when
Coroner Leland asked him some per
tinent. questions as to "his conduct on
the night of Ralston's death. He be
came more and' more entangled as the
searching questions were fired at him.
Beads of perspiration stood on , his
face as he wriggled about in his seat.
"Wnat is your official position?"
asked Coroner Leland.
"I am chief surgeon of the city and
county of San .Francisco, at present un
der suspension," answered Stephen.
The disrated official claimed to hold
the belief that Ralston died of . heart
failure. Then he declared that he
opened the letter In his capacity as a
special policeman In case anything ,was
Tvrongr. He took the dying man in a
hack to 'save time, he declared. Soon
after it was shown that the ambulance
â¢would 1 have been the quicker way,; as
the carriage was summoned in -a
roundabout .way. Stephen piled con

"WOMAN TOO WAS WITH ARCHIBALD RALSTOX WHEN HE DRANK POISON,
IN DELMONICO 1 8 RESORT AND WHO WAS-ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL WIT-,
NESSES AT THE CORONER'S INQUEST. WHICH WAS HELD YESTERDAY.:
when he left the stand was shaking
like a leaf.
"I was not there as chief ' surgeon,"
he declared." "I was there as a ;". pri
vate physician. I opened the letter
because. I had a right to do so. I am
a special officer," ';_ said Stephen . in the
manner of the man ". who', asserted i that
he was "a cook and a captain bold, and
a bosun tight and a midshipmite and
mate of the Nancy, brig." -
DR. STEPHEN IS NERVOUS.
"As an officer of thÂ© law, didyou deem
it your duty to suppreis this affair?" in
quired the Coroner, and Stephen squirmed
and perspired : some, more.
His attitude on the stand waÂ» frequent
ly the occasion* of suppressed i laughter.
The gayest of all the crowd and the most
ready to smUe was Hattie Thiebault, : the
woman for love 7 of whom the unfortunate
man ended his life. ' - . 'â¢ "'...-.->; .\u25a0:,\u25a0- .. :/)\u25a0
She was there in '- the gaudiest raiment
that the tenderloin could' supply.". In'her
the "vampire" was vividly .personified.*
She jested with "policemen and hangers-on
about the ] inquest room. '; When she : told
of her relations with Ralston there was
not a tremor . in htr. voice. v She' told\of
how â¢ she saw him in . his death throes
without a single tear ; or. even a I sigh of
pity for the young man who threw away
his life * and brought \u25a0 disgrace - ; upon; his
family because of his mad .infatuation
for her. -. :"â¢â.?-* ':'\u25a0"- '<\u25a0 ' r *â¢",â¢'."'
When a farewell ", letter "written : by , the
unfortunate - Ralston was i readâ a . letter
that would ; melt "the hardest heartâ she
smiled -as only'- one ' of ; the -most I brazen
kind could smile.' She wast the/ "woman
who did I not ; care" 'j. in the flesh. > ; This
man's great ; love â¢ was a - Joke to her.' -; .
â¢ "The ' little > girl comes '>;â¢ with me," ; the
letter read. "Don't blame her. f The girl

,The- hangers-on at the \u25a0; inquest"? were
silent- The sympathetic hush was broken
by a subdued titter'from; the woman, who
ruined, young; Ralston's -life.'
Malcolm B. Scarth, a friend of- Rals

UNIVERSITY
APPLAUDS THE
HAMADRYADS
ZOE GREEN R ADCLIFFE
'OAKLAND, Sept. ZLâ The presentation
of "The Hamadryads" In the Greek
Theater at Berkeley to-day marked an
Important epoch In the musical history
of California, for the stamp and seal of
approval has thus^ been set by the State
University upon the -work of a local'com
poser. It Is to the university we look for
commendation in; all things that stand
for culture and high art, and when Its
halls are opened to the scientist, the ar
tist or the musician we should know that
merit and merit alone has been the magic
Besame.. .
W. J. McCoy of Oakland, the composer
of that \u25a0\u25a0â¢ delightful music-drama, â¢ "The
Hamadryads," "is \u25a0 the first Calif ornian
musician to be bo distinguished ,by^ our
Elate Institution of . learning. That* the
compliment was well merited .was "made
very evident by the large and .-critical
crowd that listened with. keen. attention
and applauded with enthusiasm, - though
the sun beat down with tropical intensity.
The printed programme .said ' that the
first number, would be the andante from
Beethoven's fifth symphony, but 'an acci
dent to one of the orchestral parts made
a change necessary at the last moment, so
the graceful, slow movement of : Schu-'
bert'e unfinished ' symphony ; In- B minor
was rendered instead. Then ; the"overture
of Joseph D.: Bedding's '.'Man in the
Forest." '; This "symphonic legend,'^ as" it
is designated, ..was .orchestrated iby- Mr.
McCoy and was written by "Mr. Redding
for the Bohemian jinks of 1903, and is full
of the pulsing .melody that starts \u25a0'" the
man next you humming tbe air and Seep
ing time with the .."snake dancers" theme
on the back of -your chair..
The selections from "The Hamadryads'!
were the prelude,. with solo by Mackenzie
Gordon and a * chorus of male voices;'
dance of the . young" Hamadryads; the
Naiad's idyl; the supplication, with solo
by L. A.Xiarsen;;song;of deliverance with
an invisible chorus \u25a0 of female * voices * and
solo by Mr/ Gordon,- and' the finale. :
Critics have already been loud in their
praise of Mr." McCoy's * exquisite musical
Getting for. Will Irwin'B charming Bohem-;

BERKELEY, Sept. 21.â Four univer
sity students, piled in a one-seated
automobile guided by Prentiss Gray,
president of the Associated Students,
had a narrow escape from death on the
campus this afternoon, their machine
being- wrecked, as the result of Gray's
attempt to avoid a collision with Miss
Sue Adole Ross, a "co-ed," who stood in
the auto's path. ' \u0084 \

from what . appeared to be the prospect
of death or very serious Injury, for all
of tbe party. , Prentiss Gray wag. thrown
from the machine as it collided with the
stone curbing: at the side, of the drive
way and turned almost,' a complete
somersault over Mlsb;Ross'- head. She
jumped to - avoid ' him" and ;also :â¢ to get
away from the jnachine, and in her. ter
ror fell, sustaining bruises' and painful
hurts, none of.which. however, are,re
.ffarded as serious.
. Warner, Stayer. and Head were all
thrown from the" automobile when Gray
did" his acrobatic stunt, but .while all
were scratched and bruised .\u25a0â¢'= their
wounds will not.; permanently disable
them.
The automobile lies. aÂ»-wreck.;at the
scene, of the; accident, near ".the Dana
street entrance* to, the campus.; The re

the penalty which the students will pay
for^their escapade.".

What promises to be one of the most
sensational will contests of recent years
in San Francisco began yesterday before
Judge Kerrigan when Carter P. Pomeroy,
attorney for the contestants of the will
of Samuel Davis, the late capitalist who
lor many years lived and had his office'
at 403 California street, made his open-
Ing statement to the Jury. In a will
dated February 2L 1898, and which was
found at the time of Davis' death, no
provision is made as to how his. property
should be distributed by the executor,
the Union Trust Company.
The will disinherited the grand-nephews
and nieces, and one of the former in
stituted \ a search for another will that
he felti certain was In existence. Two
searches were made; and the second
brought to light a codicil dated March
17, 1904, specifying certain sums to mem
bers of ; the family and dependents and
directing the sharing of the residue among
the grand-nephews and grand-nieces
Mary G. Stone and. the two children
of Henry Davis Jr., a nephew of the
testator, found that by the codicil their
right of Inheritance would be greatly re
duced and have instituted a contest to
have the codicil declared a forgery.
SAYS CODICIL. IS FORGERY.
Testimony was- adduced yesterday
showing the feebleness and dependence
of Davis prior to his death and the
high regard he entertained for the house
hold of Ferdinand C. . Reis, his lifelong
friend. Ini addition to his closer friends,
Davis had. several, acquaintances.,, who
served him and who are remembered in
the codicil. Among them was Robert
Day, who was practically Davis' business
agent and who was employed by one of
the grand-nephews to search for a second
will. m ' ;'; â¢'/\u25a0;.
Attorney Pomeroy .made the opening
statement to the Jury. He outlined the
history of the testator, told of hi s last
testamentandlthen- reached the ques
tion of the codicil in question. He said
that the contestants would, urge the
theory that the k codicil, was a, forgery:
that a. thorough' search of the effects
of the deceased were, made, covering a
period of "many, days, \ and -that some
time after this search; was : abandoned
the codicil;, was discovered -in, a place
that had been gone over, many times In
the original search. \u25a0 At > the - conclu
sion of his opening statement the will
and contested codicil,' together with
the record, of. the probate of the will,
were Introduced. . . , ".
William B. Reis was the first witness
called. He said' that;. the deceased oc
cupied offices at: 408 California street,
together with Ferdinand; ; Julius and

Celestial's Lack of Faith.
DES MOINES, lowa, Sept. 21.â 1n an
address before'the Grant Club, to-night
former Minister to China Edwin H.
Conger said that In the failure of
Americans to build the Chinese rail
way faith had been broken with China
and America's good standing with Chi
nese seriously. Impaired.; He said:
We made a very serious mistake when we
pei mined - our Â£ railroad concession in China
to be relinquished. - It will prove a- sad blow
to cur futurs efforts to establish advantageous
business relations with ; that â¢ country. It wllÂ»
set us back many yean ' \u25a0'â¢'-:- \u25a0
. When we were granted the concession â¢ per-"
sonally I made representations to the Chinese
that the railroad would be built by the Ameri
cans who got - the .. concession.-, assured - them
on my honor \ that it - was not secured foi
the purpose of; exploitation and that it woul J
not be sold or. relinquished. Now, however
It haÂ» been and the business men of Cilna
feel that , they have a \u25a0 right . to look j upor
future business propositions t from .' Americans
with, suspicion. , The relinqulshment or he
concession was utterly defenseless It seema

TO BUILD BIG
TOWN ON COAST
The directors of the Ocean Shore Rail
road Company,,. at. their, meeting yester
day, issued a' call for" bids ; , for the con
struction of i an electric, power plant of
6000 horse-power capacity, which â ey
have decided to erect near,; the^ shore of
Half Moon Bay. -It has also been decided
to have the company's repair shops and
other buildings there, for which" a site 1
has already been selected. The directors,
who have been meeting dally,' have" de
cided to build up a big town adjacent to
their power plant/ which will supply it
with light and power \u25a0 for* manufacturing
purposes. It is s figured* that when - the
new coast road ! is in operation several
hundied men will be employed in the com
pany's shops, and \u25a0 /they VwIU be. the
nucleus for a} town, which; will be the
medium through which the railroad com-*
pany expects to; secure traffic from; the'
adjoining rich'; country. /' ' - V.
was, ant important one in the

days ; more ' than 1000 . nien will *be put to
work 5 grading the roadbed | and j blasting ;
the high bluffs along the side of which
the tracks; of the line are to be laid. "
Instead .of going ;lhto the, open' market
f or ;; the \u25a0 material necessary for,' the - con
stiuction* of the Ocean ; Shore road, Con
tractor Loss ; and" several associates ; have
formed I; a : company through ; which*, they
have purchased a i large tract \u25a0 of ; timber
land near : Half * Moon Bay,- upon which
they propose :\u25a0 to ; erect â¢ a , $30,000 "saw. mill
and cut ties and heavy;. timbers. f ; In this

time will : be saved ; in' securing and transit

RESTITUTION OF CAMPAIGN FUNDS.
IN his investigation of the affairs of the Equitable Life, Mr. Paul
Morton has traced out the. misapplied funds of the corporation
and has compelled the voluntary- restitution of large amounts,;
and has ordered suit brought for the recovery of much mqre. . He
is on sure ground when he treats the money "of the corporation as a
trust fund, belonging to the policy holders from whom it was orig
inally derived. The officers of .the company dealt with it as if it
were their own. They voted extraordinary compensation to them
selves for services not rendered. They pensioned relatives who
, were already rich. They used the money of the policy holders in
speculative ventures, the profits 'of which went -into their own
pockets. The losses came out of the. policy holders. They did this
because they operated independently of any adequate public super
vision. If they had been under the- restraints imposed. by. law upon
national banks, this gross misuse' of a trust would have been im->
possible.
The enormous benefit' that will follow to life insurance as the
result of Mr. Morton's thoroughness cannot be overestimated. The
country will insist that it be^put under most rigid public supervision.
Confidence will be restored. The price of life insurance .will be re
duced and thousands now unable to make that prudent provision for
their families and the future will find it easily within their reach.
What Mr. Morton has done in the Equitable is being projected to
the other great New York companies by the official inquiry carried
on by* a committee of the Legislature. ;
In the course of this official investigation it has been. disclosed
that life companies contributed to the Republican campaign fund in
JOO4- Such diversion of the money of policy holders is no better
and no worse than its investment in illegal pensions, in speculation,
or in paying for services that were not rendered. It is' evident that
- President Roosevelt does not intend that any favorites shall be
played in this matter, and if may be expected that political contri
butions will be refunded to the corporations that made .them. .\u25a0 'â¢;\u25a0
There cannot be one kind of morality for some and another kind
of morality for others. Political parties and corporations in 1904
were no better and no worse than they had been for a score of
years before that time. What is now made public concerning the
â¢transactions' of one Presidential campaign had been going on in"
many that preceded it. What has happened is a quickening of. the
public conscience, so that' it sees straighter and discriminates more
justly between right and wrong. Those who lament the degeneracy
of these days are on the wrong track. Instead of being degenerate
they are regenerate. They are morally better than the past. A new
base line in public and financial morals is being laid down. Men
are not only finding out how much the Written law has been violated,
but they ar^ seeing the unwritten law, more. easily violated because
its penalties may be evaded. This will, be transformed into written
law, State or national, to fit the offenses against it^ which are now
seen to be offenses, though by long tolerance they had become
custom.
The attempt of Judge Parker to make party capital out of con
ditions for which all parties and members of each are responsible
will fall flat. Mr. John A. McCall, of the New York Life, in his te? :
timony has said that if Judge Parker will show his books when he
was chairman of the Democratic State Committee "it would give
you a fit." He says that the Judge did not reject tainted monej',
but took all that was offered. This goes as far back as 1885. It
probably means that the New York Life twenty years ago was
doing just what it did in 1904. Its contribution of trust funds be
longing to its policy holders was at that time given to a Demo
cratic instead of a Republican committee. Legally Judge Parker is
protected by the statute of limitations^ But morally there is ho
' statute of limitations. If the Republican National : Committee re
fund the contributions of 1904, what will Judge Parker do about
those of 1885? -
It will be noticed that in his reply he denies that any contri
butions were solicited or received from the insurance companies in
"1904. This is denying something that was hot charged by Mr.
McCall. He said his life was made a burden by Democratic can
didates begging for money, and if Judge Parker would show his
.books for 1885 they would belie his present professions. ' To this
Judge Parker makes no reply. Every public man in the country
knows -that both campaign committees have filled their treasuries
by the contributions of all kinds of corporations, partnerships and
firms, and one party can. make no claim to exclusive or superior
virtue in that respect. They will do themselves credit by making
restitution and joining in the passage of laws to keep trust funds out
\u25baof campaigns, and to put t all political funds and their expenditure
under the protection of a wholesome publicity. %:;/ -
EXCLUDING OUR FRUIT.
'THE United States Consul atÂ»Nantes, France, reports that there
J is strong agitation in Frajice to entirely exclude American
:\u25a0 fruit from that market. The matter has been taken up by the
Chambers of Commerce at Clermont, Ferrand, Angers and other
place?. Total and permanent exclusion of our fruit is demanded on
the ground that it may introduce the San Jose scale.
As our fruit finds no considerable, market in France except
when there is a crop failure there, the Consul reports that exclusion
is'sought, not to protect the French grower at all, but to discredit
American fruit in other markets where it competes with exported
French fruit. In the course of the agitation in some of the French
Chambers of Commerce it has been said that Switzerland would be
impressed favorably to French fruit as against American, if exclu
sion legislation can be procured. .
This is a very serious matter for California. Our dried fruit
export in prunes, raisins, apricots, pears and nectarines is increasr
*ing. We have no effective competitor but France.- Our. danger lies
in the unjustified confidence that is felt in French preparations of
fruit or liquor. France does as much sophisticating, as any other
country, but there the art of catching the eye is well' understood,
and it is difficult to make the consumer believe that"; anything -in
the artistic French package can be unwholesome.; This blind faith
will do us great harm if that country irfake its plot against our fruit
effective. It.can be met only by. a more careful 'study of -the art of
preparation and packing, and- by the strictest observance of com
mercial honor.
The non-fruit producing countries should receive immediate at
tention from our packers . and exporters: It would pay California
horticulturists to cultivate the acquaintance of the- foreign Consuls
located in Saa Francisco. They send to their Governments the
same kind of reports that our. Consuls make to Washington. They
study our production and commerce. They, are fair -rneh '."and have
a" certain interest in promoting trade with the, countrfes they repre
sent. Yet we do not recall that any of them has been invited to
horticultural meetings, or to a tour through our orchards and vine
yards. It may be of great: importance to us, in the coming " war
against our fruits, to get these Consuls interested in finding the
facts by seeing for themselves. ..

of uncertain years. Rotundity jwai his
prevailing characterisUc. His cheeks wer c
round and red, as was his chin; his neck
was thick and white, his ears were \ small
and closely set to his round, V fat head.
His handsome circular physiognomy bore
a tightly curled mustache, imparting all
the smug, complacent expression of a
pampered pug 'dog. .His figure was all
curves and grace of bearing, but a certain
flippancy, a marked trace of an irrelevant,

stepped across the crowded floor and ad-r
a clerk who, was busy at .the!
desk.
It was a youth. with. a long visage full
ot sour lines. His hair was plastered until j
it shone. He was in his shirt sleeves, but
wore a flashy, conspicuous cravat and
figured j vest. . There were . pertness and
sophistication about him: He seemed con
scious of his importance and: on the alert
to demonstrate it. He glanced around the
office from time to time, 'as though little
concerned in his work, yet his typewriter
flew, with a lightning rapidity ; no less
than a languid ease. .'
He looked up quizzically as the ap
proaching stranger ; spoke to him with
smooth assurance.
Their dialogue was the inspiration of
a mutual' spirit .which: both seemed to re
spond to by tacit understanding. It was
trivial.
"Beg pardon," were the: first, words,; "I

ADVERTISEMEyTS.
Prevent
As Well As Cure
Headache
If subject to headache, take
Dr. Miles' Anti-Pain Pills when
you feel the first indication of
an attack, and you will find
that they rarely ever fail to
stop further progress.
Pain weakens the nerves, and
the longer you suffer, the more
frequent wilLbe the- attacks.
On the contrary, if the
nerves are relieved of this
weakening influence, the at-
tacks will be less frequent, and
finally disappear altogether...
Dr. Miles' "Anti-Pain _ Pills
contain no opium, cocaine, mor-
phine or chloral ; in any form.
They are absolutely harmless
if taken as directed, and will
have no other effect, except to
drive out the pain.
"Dr. Miles' Antl-Paln PlUa ar# all'
right, and I csn recommend them to
any one In need of a remedy for head-
arhe. neuralgia, or pain of . any" kind.
Mr health Is not very pood, and I am
subject to frequent attacks of severe
headache, but since I began taking
Dr. Miles' Antl-Paln Pills I CO not
suffer from that trouble as I used to.
They never fail to give relief lft a few -
minutes, and If taken promptly on the
approach of headache will prevent an
attack from coming on. Pain Pills
prevent, as tcpll as cure."

Clever Welterweights Billed to Furnish
<be Main Event of Havrthornr
Club's Miovr.
A welterweight contest that promises
to be modeled on the whirlwind plan
is scheduled at Woodward's^ Pavilion
this evening:, when George Murray, the
elu^g^er who made his mark in the
Olympic Club, matches his strength
and brawn against the skill of Jack
McLaughlin, the English fist artist. The
men are carded to furnish the main
event of the Hawthorne Club's pro
gramme. As the bout has caused
much comment in the world of fisti
cuffs, a big crowd is expected at the
ringside.
Another mill that should produce
some sensational going is the one be
tween Jack Rodney, the undefeated
lightweight from Ocean Viâ¬w, and
Frank Flores, the Olympic Club man.
Rodney has a great punch and wades
right into his man, while Flores uses
his cleverness against all opponents
with telling effect.
Six other, matches between promi
nent youths in the amateur arena com
plete the card. A new star will be
launched in the person of a colored
youth from the south side know as
the "black demon." He is said to be
a second Joe Wolcott in build and
Â«tyle. _ -

. It's many a long day since Ham Iberg
disturbed ;the feelingsof any pitcher ', by
scoring two runners with a hit. Mr. Gar
vin, late of Texas, gazed out on the vast
expanse of the right garden at Recreation
Park yesterday I and . looked on painfully
as a bingler from , the bat of Mr., Iberg
skimmed merrily along. 'Mr. Garvin : se
cured' little pleasure .when he transferred
â¢ his . gaze { to -. the : infield and saw . a \u25a0 couple
of men tearing home and making him, out
a loser on the spot.
Surely those two hits of Ham's had
their effect on; the big Portland . slabster,
as â¢ after that; he was not there. Those
two runs which" Ham was good enough to
drive in changed the aspect of^ot only
Garvin, but \u25a0 the*' entire Portland .; team.
They were only the beginning : of a flock
of, tallies the' Commuters rolled | up with
out effort during the balance of the game.
;\u25a0 It looked \u25a0 like [ one of j those proverbial
pitchers''" battles till " the ; fourth^ when
Garvin began his own undoing by passing
Moskiman. s l Kelly dumped a sacrifice at
the : pan and Richards copped off a^single
to lef t. .' Francks beat but a bunt and
Mosklman arrived. It did not look like
any other j startlers would be | pulled off
a f ter Byrnes bit at three J outshoots, but
Iberg planted a clean, wholesome % ziriger
into right and it brought both men
through. . vV.^-
For two rounds the Commuters rested,
and then they started at the grind of
making rims once more.. Van' Haltren
shot one into' right, Kruger "walked ./arid
Dunleavy. % cut loose* a double to ; left that
let Vao through. Both Kruger. and Dun
leavy completed their, trip when Moski
man beat out a slow one to third,' which
Sweeney threw away at first. '
\u0084 Just to'show he was still there with the
stick and no chance hitter, t Iberg started
another big sensation' in- the eighth,.when
he landed on one to the* score Aboard, that
made a noise likea home ruri, : but proved 1
to be only a paltry : two-sacker. This *, was
the office for every one ;' to ; take a wallop
at the ball, and'; they clouted it around
the lot 'â¢\u25a0 till two . more i. had slid "â¢; over the
pan and the score , was Bto 1. " "â¢: \u25a0 '
Besides being the . batting, kid, Ham , was
also the pitching v kid, and but "for â¢ Buck
Francks' wild -heave of McLJean's ground
er In the seventh the Giants .would' never
have grabbed a run. , Buck threw the ball
into the right field bleachers and 'big Mac
came . all the way around, f Ham.' allowed
only five hits, and he was responsible for
two of them by his butting-in tactics, as
he interfered with Francks on two
grounders. .v â¢ "/'"
Uncle. Hank announced : yesterday . that
he â¢ had signed up '. Eddie Householder to
play right field for his. ball team. 'This
looks- as though* Spencer ,will be- told to
make a sneak. . Uncle ' wants hitters badly
right: now and he .figures Householder .is
the man to wield the stick to advantage
for him. The score: - \

bury and other famous â¢ American sprint
ers. Although this is his first year in

the field day. Keen rivalry . Is displayed
more in tho % San \u25a0 Francisco Athletic
League than in any other lea**nie, and
more so this year, owing to the closely
matched teams which are to represent
Lick and Lowell. The LJck boys for the
past' few years have been .undisputed
champions of the track. Out of the last
nine field days, which comprise the Aca
demic, Bay Counties "and San Francisco
leagues, Lick has taken seven first places,
five . of which > were ' consecutive. \u25a0 -
; The graduation of some of Lick's crack
athletes has , weakened the team con
siderably. Fred Mouilen, who always
netted . from ten to fifteen > points for the
school, will be among the absentees this
time. Â» â¢ â¢
Lowell should take the mile race to
morrow, as no one can beat Harold
Maundrell* who holds the Interscholastic
record of the Pacific Coast for that dis
tance. The. high Jump, pole vault and
the broad jump first places should also
go to the wearers of the red and white.
: Where Lick will shine will be In â¢ the
SSO-yard race, , the y hammer . throw, 120
hurdles,- 220 hurdles and the quarter-mile.
, Ihere are four schools entered in the
relay race, Lowell, Lick, Wllmerding and
Polytechnic. Each claims to have a strong
team, ; and. the usual -sensational race
should result. . * \u25a0 - .
SIR THOMAS APPROVES . ;
"i OF CHANGES IN GIFT DEED
SAN DIEGO, Sept. a.â Secretary Georja
E. Bowles of the San. Diego Yacht Club
received, a letter from Sir Thomas Upton
to-day In; which .'the "famous yachtsman
agrees to the proposed changes In the
deed of gift f or . the LJpton trpphy, which
is sailed ! for each year by the yachts of
the "Pacific Coast of San Diego / harbor.
In his letter Sir Thomas says all the pro
posed changes meet with his approval,
and concludes by; wishing the San Diego
club all possible success in Its efforts to
promote the sport of yacht racing.
The new rules and deed of gift are to
go into effect on the first of the coming
year. The principal changes are those
which provide - that the title to the cup
shall remain in the possession of the San
Diego Yacht Club,\ with which the old
Corinthian Yacht Club was recently con
solidated. .It also provides that the com
peting yachts | shall be of the ' twenty-five
foot class, instead of the thirty-foot class,
as heretofore: .The contests will be open
only to bona fide cabin sloops, "which, ac
cording to the interpretation of Sir Thom
as, means a ; sloop-rigged yacht, which
shall have not < less than 20 per . cent of
her sail area before the , mast and a cabin
partitioned off from the. remainder of the
inside 'of the hull, and, which shall be
constructed' with :\u25a0 permanent bulkheads,
trunk, companlonway fitted with door, and
not I less than : two \u25a0 sleeping bunks built
Into * '\u25a0' the structure ' and permanently
fastened. >"

Showing: the Bay Shore cut-off to BurHnsam*
\u25a0 now being built by S. P. R. R.
>Â«0 to WOO. ~~~ .* Â»10 Montaly.
The above cut explains better than wards
the great saving of time possible with the com-
pletion of \u25a0 the â¢ Bay Shore Cut-oft now nearly
half completed. Several large bodies of men
with the aid of latest maehlnery are push-
Ins this work ,to a completion. In about %
year It will be done. By avoiding the lons
uphill and crowded city streets and very ma-
terially shortening the distance, the new dou-
ble track road win .bring Burtlngame within
less than 25 minutes of the city. The running
time now. however. Is only 88 minute*â little
longer than it takea to reach many parts of
the city. Do you realize what the . shorter
.time will mean to property interest* at Bur-
lingame? It brings Burllngame cloaer than
any other suburb of San Francisco and with-
out the annoyance of ferry-boata and ths
transferring - incident to their use. It means
a city will spring up as large, as Oakland and
Berkeley are to-day. . .
Possibly you are not up on Burllngasie?
You may not realize that it enjoys an abeolutÂ«
change of climate from Ban Francisco, a cll-
matt as good and even superior to any In th^
whole world. Besides climate, Burllngam* Is
naturally beautiful and has been . selected a *
the site of very many beautiful country place*.
We are now* placing on- the market the prop-
erty which until recently belonged to the>
Sharon estate.
Great large lots. BCxISO and larger, at prices
from $450 to $600. on terms of one-fifth cash,
balance $10 monthly. Every lot races oo*
â¢treet which is graded, sewered and well ma-
cadamized with blue rock: water mains aro
also laid in every street.
Building restrictions which are very reason-
able and will meet the approval of. all will bÂ»
enforced to prevent objectionable buildings,
stores, etc.. and Insure a rise In value to th*
lots. '
You can surely make money In Burltegam*
real estate. Don't wait for the new cut-off
to be finished and then pay two or thre* ttm<Â»Â»
the present price. Remember we have th# best
lots h* Burllngame: we are in early and have
secured the best land. It will pay you to go

Henry CUws of . Kew York sends out the
following-;
*T%e Government'a figures Justify an in
crease of something like 20,000,000 bushels to
the already record-making August indication
of cora, while the measure of the August de
terioration in spring wheat is shown' to have
been below 6.000,000 bu&hels. On the basis
of. the Government's figures -of 'eettditlon and
area the harvest promise of corn is figured by
the trade statisticians at 2t715.916.000 . bushels
*nd of wheat 7c>4, 447,000 bushels. The former
volume has never been exceeded, and the lat
ter but once, namely, by the 74t*,4f>0.000 bush
.*U rcpretetcting the llwl harvest. The IiHH

Couon is leaving our shores at an unprece
dented rate, the official statement for August
ahonrizLg an increase in the value of the ex
ports of the staple amounting â¢ to $34,0U0.0iÂ»,
while the exports for the cotton year ending
August 21 were the largest in volume \nd in
value in the trade's history. Our breads tuffs
have' tot yet tegua. "to go abroad In large
QU&Btltes, though & rood demand exists for
them us Boon as prices reach an export basis,
to which they axe apparently tending; and
the fact that there have been active engage
ments of ocean freight accommodation on the
regular ocean liners indicates preparations for
a, large "ani. active season. Official reports
Â©overtjig sixty-four out of seventy-two g-overa
cseats of Russia show decreasec, for instance,
Mt their current harvests from those of 1904 of
178Â»0OO,C00 bushels of waeat. 352,000,000 buah
*;Â« of rye and 236,0iK),000 bushels of oats. The
crops of France have r!so been the . subject
of unfavorable reports during the week, co
that a year of active shipments is at hand un
less speculation shall lorce American prices
too high. Notwithstanding the small ship
ment of breadstuffs, our general merchandise
export eiatcnitT.i is continuing its re
cect excellent ehowinfr. indicating for the eight
of the calendar year just ended an
of $103,076.4*5 In the value of our
! imports and of f115.149.5C8, in the export ac
count. In the Industrial situation a very sub
stantial index of the future is the activity of
orders, particularly of eteel rails, . for delivery
next year. Usually responsible authorities
now figure that such orders for Eteel rails
amount to 1,500,000 ton? at current prices."

NEW YOP.K. Bept. 21.â T0-day's eariy
stock m&rket .a.i a:i appearance of consider
able etrength and tr.in.atiou, and special
stocks made emking Advances, much In the
xnacner of yesterday's market. Some con
straint developed in the later operations and
the rate of activity fell away very materially.
'i :. ,- marking up of the call money rate was
the potential influence in this result. Deals
and rumors of deals played a large part in
lie principal movements of the day, which
were in stocks supposed to be in the hands of
pools or susceptible readily to manipulation.
Both Canadian Ps.c:nc and Reading were
prominent leatures .during the < daj-. Rumors
continue very active, w'th the 'alleged project
c' a new issue of Great Ncrthern preferred to
present stockholders, and St. Paul figured in a
rumor of impending issues of f 25,U(*>,000 of
authorized stock, with subscription privileges
J' ctockholdtrs. Rates for call money were
and higher, although time loans, were
called somewhat e&eier, the * demand" for that
kind of accommodataion having subsided some
what. Yet Sub-Treasury operations this week
have yielded to the bacYs over a million dol
lirs, compared with * loss for the correspond
ing t>eriod - last week of $565,000, indicating
aa advantage in this week's showing of
$7,000,000 over last week. The â¢ interior de
mand has also relaxed. This seems to Indi
cate that the banks are relieved from the
necessity of calling . loans fh order to keep
within the reserve limit. " It U assumed.
- therefore, that the hardening of the money
tnarket muet have to do with the disposition
of the trust - companies' funds, rather than
with those of the banks. The retention ot the
Bt.r.k of England rate was a favorable factor
in the day's market. A renewed fall in for
eign exchange resulted, but- the decline- was
not sufficient to reach the point of profit for
further engagement of gold for Import. "The

After five hours'. 'deliberation the Jury
In the case of ' Julio '-Zegnier! Uriburu,"
charged with embezzling many, francs be
longing to Signorina Tetrazzini, the sweet
| voiced Tlvoliprima' .-'donna,*; rendered :a
I verdict of acquittal. The discarded secre-'
1 tAry did not seem, to.be much interested
Iln .'his. fate. The; look of tired disgust
that has been on his face since his arrest
did not change during the. five-hour. wait.
He is still . held : on" '.' a : second ' count : of
felony -emberzlement. .
' \u25a0 Attorney - Peery ' In his . closing argment
compared Uriburu to Don ; Jose the "easy,
:mark".-in the opera v .Carmen," and said
â¢Tetrazzini* was Carmen"; ln real' life. Ba
>elii;-Uriburu'sVsuccessor; to the. friend
ship.of the, sllyefy-yoiced diva, was Esca

end traeically /was rfor ; the .jury to de
cide, declared Peery; ' .' ''\u25a0;* . '/ .,
-TetrazElniwas castigated for her. fickle
ness by; Peery. "She was 'called, the "siren
who. lured, this" young: man *Â»* from 'A nls
home"- and "that , false woman"/ and ; men
tioned by many other disparaging terms.
Dazzled by her. Uriburu left everything
to'follow her, only to be cast aside ' for
another.;;..' . . : ' \u25a0'- :
Assistant^ District Attorney \u25a0 Ferral was
equally hard V upon . Uriburu." . "He calls
hiniself .a ' diplomat," sneered iFerral.'
"Why, " the ' man' never earned an honest
dollar in his life." Ferral also scoffed at
Uriburu's alleged honorable lineage. '
The crime with which Uriburu was
charged was the embezzlement of about
$300, American money, which ' was in
trusted to him by Tetrazzini to ; pay a
dressmaker's bill at Milan. ' He was taken
to . the County Jail . immediately af ter. the
verdict was announced to await trial on
another charge of the same nature.

DeÂ«^:Puiham:-- _
'"AboÃfrtwo years ago I was a great saz-,
f erer from a severe female trouble, pains and
headaches. The doctor prescribed for me and
finally told me that I had.a'tumor on the
womb and must undergo an operation if I
wanted to get well; : I felt that this was mr
death warrant/ but I spent hundreds of dol-
lars for medical help, but the tumor kept
growing. ' Fortunately I corresponded with
an aunt in the New England States^and she
advised me to take Lydia E. Pinkham's Veg-
etable Compound, as it was said to euro tu-
mor*. I did so and immediately began to
improve In \u25a0 health, and I was entaxelv cured,
the tumor disappearing entirely, without an
operation. '. I\u25a0. wish â¢ every,, suffering woman
would try this great preparatum." .
Just as snrely las Miss Adams waa
cured of the troubles ' enumerated in
her letter, just so surely .will Lydia E.
Pinkham's Vegetable Compound enre
every woman in the land who . suffers
from womb 'troubles.- inflammation of
the ovaries, kidney troubles, nervous
excitability \u25a0 and ' nervons prostration.
Mrs. Pinkham invites all . . young
women who are ill to write her for tree
advice. Address, Lynn, Mass; '
