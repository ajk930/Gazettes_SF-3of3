The fact developed to-day that the

traveled over the main county road to
within five miles of this place, then
made a detour to the southwest and eu
tered the ; main road again six ; miles
out. They have since traveled by the
main road. This boldness, on the part
of the robbers cannot be accounted for.
Colonel William F. Cody will not Join

with his English and other guests for a

After a short session the Grand Jury
yesterday voted to file an accusation of
fraud against the. Board of Election
Commissioners. The language UBed in
the charges Is terse and clear. "Will
ful and corrupt misconduct in office" is
.its burden and several sneciflcatlons
are given.
On receiving the accusations District
Attorney Bj-ington immediately or
dered the Election Commissioners to
appear to answer them in Judge Law
lor's court on November 16 and to
ehow cause why they should not be re
moved.
The Grand Jury also determined to
appoint 250 responsible citizens to
v/atch over the booths on election day.
"We will appoint more if we think it
necessary," added Foreman Lilienfeld.
These special inspectors will probably
bs named upon recommendations by
the Merchants' Association. The jury
appointed a committee to investigate
rumors that proceedings in the jury
room have not been kept secret.
The first charge against the Commis
sioners is that they appointed Joseph
Rebsto^k. Fred Hancock, Â£.. TL. Whit
ney, J. W. Freeman. John Spargo and
W. W. Abraham to act as elec
tion officers at the primaries on
August 9, knowing that they were
cot on the last assessment roll,
e.r.Â«l that they were all members of the
same political -party. It is also alleged
that none of these? election officers
?nietl la -thÂ« -Eisbtetnth -primary- ehic-*
tion. precinct, in which ' they were
named to serve. This is in violation of
the laws governing primary elections.
At the time of their appointment as
election officers three of these held po
sitions under the municipal govern
ment, Rebstock as foreman of the
Sprinkling and Cleaning Department
.of the city, Hancock as a teamster in
.the Electrical Department, and Spargo
Â«ts a stonecutter for the Board of Pub
lic Works. Each was drawing pay
"from the city when i .e Election Com
missioners appointed them to serve at
. the. primaries.
The appointment of six other elec
Â¦ tion officers in the Seventy-third pri
mary precinct is declared illegal on tho
ground that they were not on the last
.assessment roll and that they all be
longed- to the same oolitieal party.
The Election Commissioners are
charged with making these appoint
ments knowing them to be illegal. "All
bl which the Board of Election Com
; rnissiohers well knew," reads the ac
cusation of the Grand Jury.
' 'Â¦'.-. ASKS THEIK REMOVAL.
"Wherefore the said jury prays,"
concludes the document, "that the said
jSobert W. Roberts. James A. Devoto,
E. C. Lfcffingwell. Thomas Maguire and
A. W. Voorsanger be required to an

ST. PETERSBURG, Nov. 4. 1:25 a. m.
There is a scarcely veiled feeling of re
lief throughout the. city that the day
has passed without bringing news of
the fall of Port Arthur. There had been
deep: fear that the .Japanese might
push home the final attack to-day. It
Is. now. felt '.-that* there may come an
other period of respite. â¢ The authori
ties state that they are without direct
news from Port Arthur and every one
is depending. upon foreign sources for
tidings; of- the devoted garrison. .
LONDON, Nov. 4.â The Daily Tele
graph's ' Chefu correspondent, tele
graphing on Thursday, says that the
Japanese losses during the last assault
upon Port Arthur . were ; heavier . than
on. any of the previous attacks. 'The
bombardment was so fierce, he says,'
that the streets ' of Dalny trembled as
though an earthquake shock had oc
curred.
.The same paper's correspondent -with
General Oku, . under date of November
2, says that. the indications are that a
terrific engagement is ' about to com
mence.
A dispatch to a news agency from St.
Petersburg says Lieutenant, General
Stoessel, commander of the Russian
troops at Port Arthur, is reported to be
wounded in the leg. . J *
, CHEFU, Nov. 3.â The Japanese now
occupy i positions which, place-the east
side-; qf Port -Arthur at their . mercy.
The last- assault has gained for them
positions which insure their ability to
enter the main east forts, whenever
they are ready. . Â¦ ;,.,...: â¢
It is calculated by the Japanese, that
the Russians, if they do not surrender,
will be, capable of prolonging their
final stand at Liaoti Mountain and on
the Tiger's Tail for- a . month lonsrer.
but long before the second Pacific
squadron shall arrive the Japanese flag
will wave over the wrecked citadel. ..
The Japanese have not occupied the
main forts and highest points of the
east hills, but they occupy in over
whelming numbers positions which will
enable them to drive the Russians back
whenever they desire. "When the Jao
nese occupy the eastern ridge of forts
they will completely dominate the other
Russian forts with their artillery. ..'

Anniversary of the Accession of. Nlcho-
las Not a Great Holiday
ST. PETERSBURG, Nov. 3. â Then*
was little attempt to-day to celebrate,
except in a perfunctory way. the tenth
anniversary of the accession of Em
peror Nicholas. The imperial family
attended a te deum at the cathedral
and there were services in all the
churches. Later the troops were par
aded, the theaters gave free exhibi
tions to the school children and there
were musical and other holiday f dis
plays in the.parkfls, but onr accouptof
the war and the anxiety regarding
the situation at Port Arthur every
thing was on a small scale..- ' * J.i Â¦ â¢, t
PARIS. Nov. 3. â The Associated
Press is enabled to state positively
that its. dispatches from Chefu, Port
Arthur and Tokio last June, to' the ef
fect that the JaDanese battleship Ya
shima had been sunk by a mine oft
Dalny, which dispatches were denied
by the Japanese authorities at the
time, have â¢ finally . been officially con
firmed. .The Japanese Government
has notified foreign governments" of
the loss of the ship. The number of
men who went down with the vessel
is not known, but it is believed to
have been small. The official details
show that the Yashima' struck a Rus
sian mine .and later attempted to
make " Dalny*^ harbor, but this proved
impossible and she sank in deep wa
ter.
The loss of the Yashima has been
concealed by the Japanese, -though
the Russian authorities have believed
for some time that the reports that
'the battleship had been destroyed
were correct. It is important, since
it is now disclosed. that Japan has
only four modern battleships remain
ing. These are the Asashi, Fuji, Mik
asa and Shlklshima. Another vessel
classed as a. battleship Is the. Chlnyen,
taken from China in 1894, but she
old and not of much fighting value.
experts say the small "battle
ship force possessed by Admiral Togo
was responsible for the tactics he ob
served at the naval battle of Augrust
10, when Admiral Withoeft attempted
to escape from Port Arthur, the Jap
anese battleships refusing to come to
close quarters with . the . enemy, but
pounding them from a distance . arid
sending in the torpedo-boat destroy
ers to make night attacks. -. - . /.
The Yashima was one of the finest
battleships of the Japanese navy. Her
displacement was 12,300 tons, about
the size of the American battleship
Maine, and she had a speed of nine
teen knots. She carried a heavy bat
tery of four twelve-inch, ten six-inch
and twenty-four other guns of smaller
caliber.
The Russian squadron at Port Ar
thur includes five modern battleships,
more-orless damaged, and Rear-Ad
miral Rojestvensky's command, which
is now en route from the Baltic to 1-he
Far East, ''â¢ has seven "battleships.. 7 '-

other regiment made its way up the
vtst slope of 174 Yards Hill, under the
concentrated fire of the 'Russian artil
lery, .and captured the fort at the point
of the- bayonet at noon. The Japanese
captured five field guns and four ma
chine guns. Their casualties were
1400. Three hundred and fifty Rus
sian dtaci were left in the position.
At daylight on the followilng day
a If the Japanese batteries of the center
division concentrated their fire on the
Benjusan and Keekwan forts, but de
e^ite the artillery support the Jap
anese were driven out of the East
Keekwan fort by an attack by a
massed body of Russians from the
Chinese wall.
The assault threatened to result in
an utter failure to secure a foothold
on tbe fortified ridge and General Xogi
funJmoned the general of the left and
oenter divisions to consult with him
concerning the operations. During
his absence, at 11 o'clock in the
â¢morning, 'without special orders, sev
eral companies of a regiment of the
center -division emerged from their
trenches, at the foot of the East Ban
jusari fort and in tens and twenties
charged up the slope to the broken
wall of the trench around the crest
of the fortified hill and under cover of
a splendid shrapnel practice from
iiielr field batteries in the valley. The
Russians behind the wall and in the
fort, poured out a hail of rifle bullets
tr.d the machine and quick-firing
grins ' belched" forth on the " intrepid
Japanese. Twice the latter were forced
back, until the slope was covered with
bodies, but a third attempt was made
and a score of Japanese reached the
bio-ken wall. The terrible fire of the
.Russians, however, started their re
tirement.
TURNS DEFEAT INTO VICTORY.
" Suddenly a Japanese officer, regard
less of- the danger, stood up, called out
an order, planted his regimental flag
pn the wall and was immediately rid
dled by Russian bullepsi. The effect
op the Japanese of this sacrifice was
instantaneous. The retreating infan
trymen stopped In their,. tracks, hesi
tated and then charged, 'back, fought
like demons, jumped.-, over the wall,

During the morning of August 19 the

find the' ranges and an entire division
.of infantry advanced and assaulted the
Russian redoubts at the foot of Rihl
ur.g Mountain. The troops captured
'the -trenches in front of the redoubts.
â¢ The operations began in earnest at
daybreak on the 20th with a bombard
rnt-nt of the whole line of Russian forts,
iiatte.ry' after battery of Japanese ar-
V'lerywas unmasked, the Russians ap
parently being unab'e to locate them,
fq,'r" they 'replied spasmodically. Under
cover of; the bombardment the Jap

eral advance against the Russians' first
trenches, along the railroad into the
Ctnttr of 'the Shuishi Valley and also

was made by the Japanese. during the
.afternoon to capture the strongest

outflanking the Russian, forces and
slowly forcing their lines back to the
"foot "of the fortified hill's. 3The Jap

furiously and engaged the Russians,

In . the afternoon *a -'battteshim ' ap
parently the- Retvizan, steamed .out p.f
the harbor and a. half dozen -.torpedo
boats chased the. Japanese torpedo
boats on duty off Port Arthur, the lat
ter rapidly rejoining their large war
vessels in the offing.
There was tremendous activity, the
rear lines sending forward :ammuni
tion.; The news came, in -whispers .that
a general assault along the whole line
would take place between* midnight
and 3 o'clock in" the "morning: For
hours after the ominous darkness and
silence was broken by an occasional
shell from the Japanese batteries,
while the Russians burst many stat
lights overiShuishi village, where they
made a feint to sortie Immediately af
ter a furious fusillade in the rear of
the captured forts. Here the Rus
sians, anticipating an assault, made a
strong counter attack. The Japanese
advance lines were - driven from the
forts and were furiously attacked" by
large bodies of Russians, who- also,
worked down pn.~ either side: of -the
captured Banjusan ..forts, to- the val
ley In an attempt to cut off the re-,
treat of the Japanese f f om the two
forts. The Russian move was cleverly
planned and the artillery command
ers were well informed, ' for they*
opened fire with shrapnel, on the ad
vance of the Japanese supports across
the valley, using starlight and search
light with good effect in the counter
attack on the Japanese forces. â¢" '-' :
Dawn of the 23d : developed, a- pe
culiar position. -â¢ The 4jnpane.se had
pierced the Russian fortified- tidtje
east of Port' Arthur, in the form of a
wedge, while the entire line east and
west was still strongly held.
At daylight the Russians concen
trated their shrapnel fire on the cap
tured forts and the Japanese south of
Keekwan were ejected from their po
sitions. The Benjusan forts were sub
jected to an awful fire, but the Japan
ese in possession of them continue!
making bomb-proof trenches on the
hills. Â¦ '-
tenches and they stubbornly held the
corner wall and a> small section of the
Russian trenches. until 5 o'clock, when
two -companies of another regiment
worked ' through "the trenches and at
tacked . the West Banjusan fort, me
magazine of which had been blown up
by a shell a short time before. Tak
ing advantage of a diversion of the
Russian fire, the Japanese attacking
the first fort forced the Russians back,
captured the fort at the point of the
bayonet and pursued the Russians
along the connecting trenches to the
Chinese wall.
The West Benjusan . fort .â¢ was cap
tured at 7 o'clock, after a slight re
sistance. The Japanese .were^unibla
to occupy.it,: as. the", magazine; vwAs

Karly on the morning of ..the 20th' the"; whole
force waa concentrated " In Â¦ a â¢' furious r assault

On the evening of the 14th a regiment of the

ShuishI Valley \ from parallels fifty Â» yards â¢ dis
tant. These forts were strong, connected ad
vance works, constructed in the form of* hol
low square, open > In s the r rear and extfnding

half moon fort. '' wlth^ bombproof : connecting
trenches on-three-aldeis.- On the southern front
the half moon forts and trenches were protected
by a moat similar to the. one In front of the
Rihlung Mountain*' redoubt. The -first assault
of the Japanese waa made before 'dark. A bat
talion and a -half advanced against the strong

The bombardment was started at dawn. The
Russians failed to reply till the afternoon,
which delayed the attacks until 5 o'clock in
the evening. â¢ .".. .Â¦>
Three battalions of the center division ad
vanced from the parallels and attacked a "re?.
doubt at the foot of .Rlhlung- Mountain, which
the Japanese twice before had trled'\to' cap-"
ture. The works were strongly built and sur
rounded by a ditch, perpendicular walls and
breastworks. There was also a steep distance
to the top of the parapets and at the bottom
was a ditch twenty-five Veet deep. The In
terior of the redoubt was faced with heavy
Umbers, the trenches around were bombproof
and there were heavily constructed block
houses, loopholed for infantry and machine
guns. From the rear of , the redoubt -.- three
lines of trenches extended to Rlhlung fort.
The main attack was made against the
northeast corner and simultaneously a -Jap
anese battalion attacked . the cast Una of
trenches. The Japanese were met by a tremen.
dous fusillade from rifles and machine guns and
were forced to retire to their trenches, but at
4 o'clock In the morning the main attack. waa
made and the Japanese succeeded In capturing
the redoubt, .entering It through a breach made
by the artillery.
A fierce band-to-hand encounter â¢ Inside the
redoubt followed, during which nitrate "and
hand grenades were used to destroy the block
houses, whose defenders stood their ground
until the last maji was bayoneted. The Rus
sian trenches were â¢ captured and occupied by
the â¢ Japanese, but the redoubt - was destroyed
with explosive*. '.-â¢Â¦.
While the, siege operation* were in progress
reinforcements, - mostly from the Second Re
serves, were added -to the ' existing units. - to
bring the army up to Its full strength, and it
was announced from headquarters that the
siege operations would be finished with aÂ«gen
era! assault on September 19 upon the Jfahao
kayama ridge.- the 203-mefer hill, that of the
Moon forts of the' Bhuishl Valley and' the . re
doubt at the foot of Rlhlung Mountain.
SECONTD GENERAL ASSAULT.
' The Russians apparently had -an Inexhaust
ible fiUDply of heavy ammunition.' Hundreds
of ten and twelve Inch shells were hurled "at
'Japanese batteries when- they were located,
with serious effect; The heaviest Japanese guns
wnv 4.2 and ->i inch naval puns. At the end
of. August some heavier howitzers arrived and
"werV mounted on concrete. They were found
to be wonderfully effective. | It was wonderful
to sea how-, seventeen-ton guns - we re Â«. moved
miles over bad road*. " "Â¦
There are- plenty of volunteers for the des
perate " service of cutting entanglements and
recovering the wounded. Acts Â« of bravery
were Innumerable. . - ' - * '.
The pioneers suffered heavy casualtiea in
cutting entanglements. After the failure of
the regulation device for removing wires, the
pioneers- were sent to attach ropes to posts to
which entanglements were atached," and troops
in the " trenches . pulled the ropes, dragging
posts and heavy wires away. This worked eat.
iffactortly until the- enemy began -the um of
bracing wirei. The pioneers then advanced
and fell as thouch killed close- to the entan
glements and remained motionless until, un
observed. - they could Â¦ work along- on their
backs under the wires, which they cut with
long eheare. As a result of this expedient the
Russians, made certain that all were dead who
fell near the entanglements.
The latest expedient was a steel shield cov
ering the face and body, suspended from the
shoulders of the pioneers, from behind which
the cutters were used. . I>ynamlte bombs are
used by the Russians against the Japanese
trenches and* advance works. For assaulting
forts, where it was impossible to use bombs,
wooden mortars were' made, bound with bam
boo. â¢ .These are carried by tbe soldiers, and
with them bombs were thrown 60 to 150 yards.
These were the nywt effective of the' many de
vices tried by the . Japanese.
â¢In order to recover the wounded men, vol
unteers, crawled from the trenches at night
and worked along on their stomachs, pulling the
wounded slowly to cover by .the heels. . Many
of -the wounded were not recovered.
While the defenders of the Banjusana were
converting â¢ the forts .and trenches Into bomb
proofs the, army waa "constructing a system
of eleire parallels, the left - division ; toward
the east, the center division toward the re
doubt at the: foot of the Â¦. Crh . forts and the
right division toward the -.Lunettes" south of
Shuishi village. The Russians sortled and at
tacked working parties almost every night,
while guns bombarded by day. .- -â¢' .
As the Jar>anese trench line - neared the
entanglements on the fort hills the sorties be
came more frequent and ' determined. - Quarter
was neither asked nor given; the fiercest an
tagonism waa displayed, and even stretcher
bearers were killed. The cause of this was
that the Russians alleged that their forts were
bombarded while a messenger under a white
flag was delivering the Emperor's message oa
August Iti. The reeling was augmented, and
later all Kacs were unrecognized.
The Japanese casualties from the 19th
to the 24th were 14,000. The center di
vision alone lost 6000, and a single rec
iment lost 2500. Only six officers and
200 men of this regiment were left after
the fight. * ' ' . . :
The retention Vof the Russian" forts.'
giving'the Japanese a foothold on the
fortified ridge, was the sole result of
six days of general assault. The abil
ity of General Stoessel and the deter
mined spirit of the 'Russians had been
underestimated, and the experiment
was never repeated.
As with the Russians at Plevna, with
spirits dashed- by repulses and" heavy
losses, the Japanese army settled down
to sapping and making parallels. .
two weeks the Russians were unceas
ing in their efforts' to recapfure the
Banjusan forts. . They bombarded and
assaulted by day the bombproofs and
trenches which- the Japanese . repaired
â¢by night. Though the Japanese' resorted
to unoccupied decoy trenches T: and
bombpfoofs, the daily loss was 100 in
each fort until September 8. when the
Russians ceased their continuous ef
forts to recapture the forts.
FEROCITY OF THE FIGHTING.
COST OF THE ASSAULT.
During, the night' of the 24tn tue ranks
of the Japanese were so 'decimated by
the furious -shrapnel -fire of the-Rus
sians that they, were forced to retire to
the valley below: the captured forts,
and what might/have been a successful
general assault, with the capture of the
fortified ridge east of Port Arthur.. was
converted by: Russian tactics into a re
pulse, redeemed in: part by the won
derful fighting;, qualities of the Japan
ese infantry and their, refusal to accept
what seemed to be the inevitable. .
to scale the heights and â¢was forced to
intrench at the foot. .
Four assaults wÂ«rev made by, the Japanese
during the next two days. but*, they were all
repulsed. ' The i- third regiment -was finally
compelled t<i retire from â¢ the trenches at' the
foot of the hill, by a concentrated shrapnel . fire,
from the; valley below.. The -unsuccessful at
tempt to capture the advance fort resulted' In
2000 Japanese casualties. A hundred and
eighty Russian dead were found at .Nahao
kayarna. which waa * covered by a network .of
trenches and â¢ bombproof s protected by. a steel
plate covered with earth walls and surrounded
by loopholes and sandbags.
The corners of ' the forts were strengthened
by steel plates and there were triple rows of
wire - entanglements on the hill slopes. The
Russian defending force was estimated â¢ to
number 1000 men. The fort mounted three
field guns, two larger guns, and three-ma
chine-guns. Xahaokayama was protected by.
a double row of entanglements and two lines
of trenches, the upper line being partly bomb
proof. - ;.!.â¢.:;
The Japanese 1 were disappointed, at- their
failure to .capture the advance fort, .which
was the key. to toe western , fortified ridge.. :
FOUR ASSAULTS REPULSED.
'The ' artllleiy' duel" - continued- until â¢ 5:30
o'clock In the evening, when -the first Japanese
regiment, carrying its flags, advanced up the
slope of Haokayama to the dead ground which
the single- company had gained the previous
night. The Russians retired to their first line
<jf trenches during the night and several lines
of "Japanese were extended along the slope
under cover, of. the -ridge. .They carried the
ridge line on the crest of the hilL
The rush of the Japanese was a splendid
spectacle, ending with a bayonet encounter
with the Russians on the full sky line. Stones,
bayonets, swords and hand grenades were used
by both sides. The utmost ferocity waa dis
played. ' Â¦
When the Japanese had carried the east
halt of the ridge the Russians retired to the
west. Before darkness the Japanese were In
possession of the- whole ridge,- which they re
tained despite an awful . shrapnel fire from the
Chair Hill. Tiger's Tail and Llaotl forts, j
At 10 o'clock in" the evening the third
regiment advanced on ' the southwest elope of.
the advance fort on ' Nahaokayama > H1U. A
email party, gained the fort on the crest, ; but
was driven out the next' day. , ,
h-By 11 o'clock a small party of the. second
regiment '. charged * forward io-: gain'.* the : foot
of the west slope. The Russian" batteries .were
evidently waiting for. the Japanese/aa.a'.won
derful shrapnel fire . was opened : on - them.
Every man seemed - to - fall. Although at
rifle range the- firing of shrapnel continued for
twenty minutes, .until' all the-, Japanese were
mowed down..." .-â¢ , . . " . Â¦. - -
* During the 'night a party of sappers cleared
away the Russian : . wire entanglements. The
Japanese bombardment began at dawn on the
20th and all- the morning the slopes of the
hill were transformed Into an inferno by
shells. . -v '"'.Â¦ Â¦Â¦'=: .".= ",' " '" 'Â¦' 'Â¦
AN IXFERNO OF SHELLS,
In' the meantime a second Japanese regiment
advanced from the west slopes, of a 203-meter
hill and a third regiment moved against the
southwest' slopes. .The second regiment was
unable to make much progress, but' the third
regiment reached the Â¦ foot of the . southwest
slope.
The attack ; upon Â¦ the 2O.'5-meter hill and the
ridge Immediately. north of ltrÂ»called-Nahaoka
yama, was started 'at 5 o'clock- In' the evening
of*the 10th by two regiments of the Right di
vision. and one regiment of the Second division.
The First Regiment advanced against Nahaoka
yama from' trenches close. to the Russian lines.
A*. Japanese company, 'in parties of ten and
twenty, reached the dead ground on the north

George A- Wright was interviewed
at his home last night. He said that
'his resignation had been accepted by
Collector Lynch and that he had not
been short in his accounts or com
mitted embezzlement In any manner.
Mr. Wright is a nephew of Mrs.
Walter N. Dimmick. He came, from
Los Angeles four years ago to succeed
Deputy Frick, -who had gone into the
law business. Up to the present time
he has always borne an excellent rep
utation and has many friends. A lit
tle more than a year ago Mr. Lynch
was obliged to reprimand him for
neglecting - the duties of his office by
reason of -,his convivial habits, but
since his marriage shortly afterward
h*> made a notable reform in* that re
gard WSKtKSSBBSSBtk
A special dispatch received from
Washington last night says that the
discovery was made a few days ago
by Special Revenue Agent B. M.
Thomas that Wright was short in his
accounts. An examination . of the
books disclosed that the shortage
amounted to the sum of $4000, which
Eum was paid to Collector Lynch yes
terday, the shortage having begun last
April and having been increas
ed to the sum stated by sub
sequent embezzlements. It is not
believed in the Commissioner's depart
ment that Wright gambled away all
this money, "but from Information re
ceived from San Francisco." continues
the dispatch, "it Is evident that the
unfortunate young man had become
the victim of some unscrupulous
friends. It is expected that United
States District Attorney Marshal] B.
"Woodworth for the Northern District
of California will be instructed to
prosecute the dismissed official."
"that he may have 'held out' money
and afterward replaced it, but that
fact cannot be ascertained until we
have concluded our investigation into
liis accounts; but we have gone far
enough to know that none of the
money, stamps or other property is
missing. It is true that 1 demanded
and received h}s resignation."
Bert M. Thomas declined to make
any statement other than that he and
Sir. Lynch were making an Investiga
tion of WrJght's accounts and that
Wright was no longer in the Govern
cient service.
Collector Lynch said yesterday th"at
he and United States Revenue Agent
'Bert M. Thomas had been investigat
ing Wright'* accounts and had found
that there was no shortage whatever.
He himself, he said, had .demanded
Mr. - Wright's resignation because
Wright had beerj careless in his work,
allowing his accounts to run behind,
and had been guilty of irregularities.
"It may t>e." added Mr.' Lynch,
Following upon the scandalous de
falcation of Cashier Norton and In
ternal Revenue Collector O. M. Wel
burn and the "graft" of William H
â¢DiUard a few years later, comes an
oiher scandal in the internal revenue
oflic*. in which George A. Wright,
chief deputy under Collector John C.
Lynch, is the 'culprit. Mr. Wright
v;as summarily dismissed from the
Government service at the close of
the month of October by order of the
'Commissioner of Internal Revenue at
Washington, it having been ascer
tained that the chief deputy had em
bezzled a iarge sum of money from
the Government.

gathered to hear what they consider
one of the 'most important papers on
cancer of the larynx ever presented in
this country. It was prepared and
read -toy Sir Felix Seraon of London
under the auspices of the section of
laryngology and rhinology of the New
York Academy of Medicine.
Sir Felix laid great stress upon the
necessity for men who had reached
the age of 40 years to watch closely
for symptoms of cancer of the larynx.
He advised those approaching middle
age not to delay in seeing a physician
if he were troubled by hoarseness.
The redness of the throat and the for
mation of a nodule in the vicinity oÂ£
the larynx were danger signals which,
he said, should not be neglected.
Sir Felix, in contradicting the the
ory of many American petitioners,
declared that if the cancer were rec
ognized in its early stages It could be
cured without the removal of the lar

The Marquis professes to treat the

secretly, used his wealth and influence
to' put 'every obstacle in the way of
those 7 who are soekins Â¦ evidence to

appeared and Spanish witnesses have
been Â¦ arrested on flimsy % pretexts,
among them the magistratewho drew
up the certified copy of the. real Alex
andro's death.
, The story is virtually a twentieth
century version of that of the Marquis
de Carabas. Popular interest in it has
been heightened by a theory put for
ward that it is a se<iuel to the Hum

was the original Crawford who fur

ST. LOUIS, Nov. 3.â Mrs. Louis
Szellig of 1424 Olive street to-day called
upon Assistant Prosecuting Attorney
Dalton and asked him to aid her in re
covering possession of her little daugh
ter, seven years old. She said the child
was now in San Francisco with its
father, Daniel Szellig. She told Dalton
she was separated from her husband
and had been for some time. Six weeks
ago, she said, he had abducted' the
child, at the same time taking their
savings l amounting to- $135. . ,
"I did not know what had become of
him or my child," she said. "I tried to
get some trace of them, but not until
this morning did I know where he had
Cone. I got. a letter from him. dated
at San Francisco. In it he says Ouve
is sick and wants to come back to me.
He says I must send transportation
and he will send the child. I would
do this but for lack of funds."
When Dalton told .her he could do
nothing unless Szellig returned to St.
Louis, she was greatly disappointed.
ST. LOUIS, Nov. 3. â The airship of
Captain T. S. Baldwin, which sudden
ly slipped away last night as it was
beln*" towed in from the country to the
aeronautic concourse, was found to
day sixteen miles west of St Lcruis. . It
was unharmed by its wild night flight
save for two small rents in the gas
bag. which Captain Baldwin stated
could be repaired in half an hour.
Word reached Baldwin late in the
day that his airship had been found.
He and Aeronaut Knabenshue hurried
to the scene In an automobile and were
rejoiced to find the aerial craft unin
jured with the exception of the two
light tears In the ballotm.
Captain Baldwin to-night said that
he expected to have the airship in
readiness for a flight by Saturday af
ternoon.

There was consternation in the office
of the Board of Health yesterday after
noon when Superior Judge Hebbard
handed down a decision that knocks
out the contention of the- board that
it has power to make appointments
without the approval of the Civil Serv
ice Commissioners. The opinion was
contained in a denial of the application
of James P. McQuade, Assistant War
den of the Cfty and County Hospital;
for a writ of mandate compelling
Auditor Harry Baehr to audit his sal
ary warrant.
The decision affects the status of Sec
retary Louis Levy of the Board of
Health and a number of employes who
have from time to time, in recent
months, been appointed to positions in
the various departments controlled by
the board without the formality of con
sulting the Civil Service Commission.
Up to the first of the year there was
in the gift of the Board of. Health an
office designated "Secretary of the City
and County Hospital." James McQuade
was the choice of the board for the po
sition, J)ut it was found that the civil
service rules barred him from being ap
pointed to it, A special meeting of the
board was called on January 9 and an
office designated "Assistant ' Warden
and Custodian" was created, to which
McQuade was "assigned." A salary of
$125 per month was voted him. Baehr
refused to audit the salary warrant,
hence the suit. , ,
Devoto^& Richards, his attorneys,
argued that the board had the right,
in the interest of economy,' to abolish
the former office and -that as the duties
of assistant warden and custodian
were different from those of a clerk
the offices could not be considered as
similar. - Â¦ . Â»
The attorneys for the Auditor, - in
their brief, which was held good ' by
the court, contended that there was
only one question involved: Was J.he
applicant ever duly and legally ap
pointed to the position which he fills?
Granted, they said, that the board had,
power to abolish the position of clerk-*
a position under the classified serviceâ
and to remove Wolfe and create a new
position without, the approval of the
Civil Service Commissioners, all* of
which is .denied, the fact remained
that the board had no power to: ap-'
point McQuaide without the consent of
the Civil Service Commission, . which
refused to give such consent. .
-,The ruling of Judge Hebbard,'it:is
understood, will affect the other cases
In the Board -of Health, wherein! the
positions of secretary and sanitary, in
spectors were abolished, new- offices
created and new men appointed to fill
them. The ousted employes have ap
plications for writs of mandate pend
ing.

quis. This- steward,; it is further de

In Spain the old Marquis had many
poor relations, and. some of them
dreamed of the huge fortune which
had been left in Paris rand wondered
how it happened that no share "of ; it
had come to them. Among them was
the blacksmith, Peter Riera, a man of
great natural shrewdness and keen
appreciation of the value, of : money,
for which all his .life he had worked
so hard. A few; months ago he jour
neyed from Catalonia .to Parts to in
quire into the" matter, for. ; himself.
Learning - that the old Marquis had
been blind and infirm for many years
before his death, he came to the con
clusion that there was good ground
for an action to set : his will aside on
the ground of the testator's mental in
capacity. .
For this undertaking he found some
pecuniary, support, but -the results of
researches and inquiries made con
vinced him and his financial â¢ allies
that he had a far better case than he
had.. figured Voni\ Chief among these
was the discb'very.as proven by a par
ish register, it was alleged, that Alex
andro Mora, brother, of ; Jose I Mora,*
had died in 1878 at San Martino de
Sarroca; more thanithree years before
Jose; himself died. From' this followed
naturally the conclusion Â¦ that the man
who ' had obtained "possession of the
property, of, the Marquis was an im
postor-who had personated the dead
Alexandro Mora. Â¦:Â¦
DAMAGING EVIDENCE.
POOR RELiATIOX BOBS UP.
Jose Mora survived his inheritance
only forty-seven days, dying suddenly,
and report has it unaccountably, in
Madrid. The estate was .then taken
possession of by. the man. who claimed
to be Jose's* brother. Alexandro, and
who for some twenty-three years has
been known as the Marquis de Casa
Riera. "
The Marquis died in Paris at a great
age In 1S81 and for sixteen years prior
to that he had been totally blind. He
had executed two wills. In the first
he bequeathed his property to a cousin,
who is still living, a nonogenarian, at
Barcelona. In the second will,. which
is dated two years before his death, he
left the bulk of the property 'to ' his
nephew, Jose Mora y Riera, and in
case of his death to another nephew,
Alexandro Mora. A third nephew.
Gonzalo a brother of the other two,
was bequeathed a million franos,. /
The. Marquis did not deny his guilt,
but on account of his position and
what were regarded as extenuating
circumstances he was allowed \o leave
the country and settled in Paris, oc
cupying the sumptuous hotel in the
Rue de Berri, in which the black
smith confidently expects i he will re
side some day. The palace in ' the
Calle del Alcala remained tenantless
for twenty-five years, save for the
memories of the grim tragedy that had
been enacted there, and with its doors
walled up. It was known as the
house of silence until it was torn down
and rebuilt.
WILL OF THE MARQUIS.
When he was fifty he married a
beautiful girl of eighteen, a daughter
of one of his tenant farmers. Eleven
months after her marriage the young
Marchioness was found murdered in
the palace, pierced by a dagger in a
score of places. A baby had' been born
whose paternity, on account of its
color, the Marquis disputed. There
was a negro servant in his household
who met with a sudden and violent
death at the same time as did the
Marchioness. :.\'^<%
The utcry opens with the first Mar
quis de Casa Riera, who was a man
of humble origin, but rose 'to be a
grandee of Spain and chamberlain of
the Queen. The source of his great
wealth has always been a mystery, but
it is alleged to have originated in the
theft of an immensely valuable casket
of jewels from his royal mistress.
However acquired, he gained a large
fortune and lived in. great splendor,
about the middle of the last century,
in a palace in the'Calle del Alcala,
Madrid. -' r '-'(Z i/v
The story, as it has now been pieced
together, on which the blacksmith re
lies to win his suit is as weird and
dramatic as many famed works of fic
tion. It has aroused intense interest
in the trial, which will begin in a few
weeks and bids fair to become as fa
mous in legal annals as that fight of
the butcher claimant for the Tichborne
millions.
PARIS, Nov. 3.â One of the most
singular features of the legal fight now
being waged between the poor Spanish
blacksmith, Pierre Riera, and the Mar
quis de Caaa Riera, for the latter's vast
fortunes and estates, is the fact that
the nobleman's comparitively youthful
a'ppearance, upon which he especially,
prides " himself, is being- used as a
weapon against him to justify/the
blacksmith's claim that he is an im
postor. The Manjuis, if he be the in
dividual he has long represented him
self.to be, is now eighty-one years old.
But he is remarkably vigorous and ac
tive and looks like a well preserved
man of sixty.
According to his blacksmith rival,
who alleges that he has documentary
evidence to prove it, that is his real
age. If he is only sixty it is certain
that he is not the Marquis 'de Casa
Riera and the blacksmith will gain the
title and the property and the 'fortune
of between $30 000,000 and $40,000,000
which goes with them. *
But it is not alone the striking dis
parity between the apparent years , of
the Marquis and the age he says he is
which has caused many influential per
sons to back- the poor man in his fight
against the rich man and supply him
with the means of prosecuting his
claim. Recent evidence that has been
gathered has satisfied many, shrewd
lawyers that he really.- has a good case
and stands a fair chance of ousting the
Marquis and occupying his palatial
residence in the Rue de Berri.

James C. Needham addressed the peo

night , and was given "a great .ovation.
Athletic Hall 'was crowded to the~ doors
with . an enhtuslastic audience, which
greeted the Congressman with cheers.
There were a great many Democrats
present who will vote for Needham on
account of the aid which he has se
cured for this valley and for his rec
ord, believing that it would be better
to retain a tried man than to try an
experiment. ....
Needham lauded the Republican ad

that the Democrats had passed the na

method 'pursued by the Democrats In
the distribution of circulars purporting
to give his record and said that he be

that he would stand on his .record
and spoke .of the necessity of sending
men who had experience in Congress to

After Bur chard had spoken briefly of
campaign issues, Ltvernash got a flat
tering reception. : He - introduced, his
speech- with the question, "Shall .Trade
Unionism Be Maintained,', or Shall it
Be Broken "Down?"
The Â¦ speaker made an Impassioned
appeal to the union men to remember
the sacrifices. made by those who have
born* .the battle for recognition of
unions. He spoke of the distressing
conditions . alleged to have existed in
the Pennsylvania coal mines before
unions were introduced there and ask
ed his hearers If they : wished to re
turn to the days when the coal mag
nates stooped to the cruelties of child
labor.
George Keene spoke at his work for
the unions and said that he was proud
to serve the man who had championed
the cause, of the working people In San
Francisco and who had lived down the
abuses of "an unscrupulous press."
Mayor Scbmltz urged his followers to
vote for the four Superior Judges who
were indorsed by the Union Labor con

ciary that can be depended upon to
be fair- to the working cl?"se9 all the

were present from neighboring, towns.
The Mare Island station band, a lively
flight of rockets *arid the glare of redfire

was- crowded to the doors. W. D. l*en

Republicans of the town served as vice
presidents. The speakers were United

The last Democratic meeting under
the auspices of the State Central Com
mittee wiir be hejd to-night at Pioneer
Hall, Fourth street, near Market. Con
gressmen LJvernash and Wynn and
other speakers will discuss the issues
of the campaign.
i "The. Republican .State Central Com
mittee is; not" in the degree
disturbed i by .the. fact ) that Congress
roair -Bell; lost hia head at the Demo
cratic meeting in Santa Rosa Wednes
day night and attacked Governor Par
dee for making' Republican speeches in
this The . accounts of thÂ»i
tirade against the; Governor, a3 pub
lished in the Democratic press, , repre-'
sent Â«that the Congressman was ex
ceedingly vehement. The committee
is Inclined to the view that the Gov
ernor's speeches must be inspiring to
the Republican cause. It is noted that
the Democratic - Governor of Oregon,
Mr. Chamberlain, addressed a Demo
cratic mass meeting in the Alhambra
Theater, San Francisco, last Monday
night, and.. the audience commended
him for his courage' under trying cir
cumstances. - In every State the Gov
ernor is regarded as the leader of the
party to .which . he belongs. When
William McKinley was Governor of
Ohio : he made Republican speeches In
his own State and elsewhere. In Cal
ifornia Governors Stanford, Perkins,
Markham and Gage did not hesitate to
speak for. the Republican party while
holding the exalted office of chief ex
ecutive. . .
The \ State committee fancies that
Bell's vehement tirade against Gov
ernor Pardee will cause some Repub
licans who were leaning toward the
bellicose Congressman to fall Into line
for Duncan E. McKinlay. Governor
Pardee will address the voters of Sac
ramento this evening and his ability
to speak for the Republican party and
say a word or two for himself will be
again demonstrated.
The Thirty-third, Thirty-fourth and
Thirty-fifth Assemblv districts will

the principal fifpeaker. . Senators Welch

Treadwell, Severance and Meincke will
also speak. Among the other speakers

NEEDHAM AT MADERA.
CHICAGO, Nov. 3. â Secretary Shaw
passed through Chicago this morning
on his way from Lafayette, Ind..
where he spoke last night, to Grand
Rapids, Mich. When asked if he had
replied to Judge Parker's charge that
the President used Cortelyou to get
campaign contributions from the trusts
as the price of Immunity, the Secretary
said:
No. I have not yet mentioned It. In every
reference to the Democratic candidate I have
gone on the assumption that that distinguished
Jurist was . a , high-minded gentleman and In
every way worthy to be the candidate of . a
great party for the highest and most dignified
office ever held by man; ...
If the charges he makes against the Presi
dent of . the United States, now his opponent,,
are true, then President Roosevelt 1 should be
Impeached and thereafter he should be sent
to the penitentiary.'.'.
Of course no self-respecting citizen would
be Heve such a charge against any President
'this country has ever, had.- -No one of . them
has been that base. The sad fact about it
Is that few people would make such a charge
ani? support It only by saying that Â¦an op
portunity to do the act had existed, except
those who would do exactly what they charge
If they had the opportunity. It at least sug
gests a mental aptitude both to do the thing
itself and to think evil of others. >

HARTFORD, Conn., Nov. iâ This
city, became wildly enthusiastic over
Judge Parker at a monster rally held
in the opera-house to-night. Demo
crats from* all parts of the. State came
here and the accommodations t for- the
oudience . were entirely inadequate.
The candidate was first greeted with a
demonstration on .the arrival at the
station of the special train from 'New
Haven, where the Hartford escort was
in waiting. He was Immediately driv
en to the Hartford Club, where dinner
was served. An informal reception
followed, but before it was over a
great throng had gathered outside to
serve as a 'volunteer escort to the
opera-house. At 8:30 o'clock, before
the candidate appeared to face the au
dience, which was the most demon
strative of any he had faced during
the day, the ovation lasted eighteen
minutes, most of 'the audience being on
their feet, shouting wildly, white hun
dreds of persons waved . flags. . Judge
Parker said:
. We hear much from ttme to time and from
many different quarters of the country about
the necessity of being prepared for* war. This
demand is so I insistent that the citizen is
sometimes tempted to ask whether, after all.
It would not be more timely and more helpful
for humanity If wt should consider tlje ques
tion of being prepared for peace. So far a*
periods of time are concerned It 'has an Im
portance entirely, incommensurate, to-that"de

PARKER IX HARTFORD.
I do not know that he had any Information,
but his position was one that entitled him to
get It. From that time on there has been
a gradual movement in that direction until it
U believed that every trust In this country,
including the Standard Oil trust. Is doing what
it can to elect that ticket.
The man he put at the head of that bureau
was his private - secretary. Â¦.. - After . the cam
paflÂ«i opened he became chairman of the Re
publican f National Committee, and . whatever
Information he had was perfectly well under
stood by the beads of corporations. They
know what secrets he had that they did not
care to have made nubile.
We- hare had a' very remarkable situation
presented. After the recommendation six or
elfht years - ago that action should- be taken
toward curbing the trusts, the Republican
psrty passed a statute to that end. but when
we examine the statute closely we find that
it authorizes . the President to appoint a Cab
inet officer to Investigate the trusts. The In
formation he receives may be given to the
people or kept private, as the President may
direct.
We met the gauge of battle which they
threw down and from .one end of the country
t> the other men are "saying , to each other
what you and I are saying: "This country
shall not pass Into the hands of the trusts." .
When the trusts of this country united for
the purpose of raising a fund that was to be
large enough to control the election It became
ycur duty and mine, without regard to any
other issue, to settle the question once and
for all, whether money or manhood suffrage
should control.
Of late we have had presented to our at
tention a. question of .far more Importance
than any issue presented by our national plat
form â a question that was not understood at
the time and that the party â¢ could not con
template. That is the question whether It is
possible for the trusts of this country to con
trol the eleetlons with money. -
school,, nor after they had gone out into the
world. .'
DEXIES STANDARD OIL CHARGE.
1IERIDEX, Conn., Nov. 3. â The
only rear platform address made by
Judge Parker was when his train
stopped here for five minutes on the
way to Hartford. It was- an im
promptu address, in which he flayed
the Republican party because of the
financial aid it is alleged to have re
ceived from the trusts. He charged
that every monopoly was doing every
thing in its power to bring about the
election of the Republican ticket.
This speech created a sensation,
both in the audience gathered at the
station and among the members of
the Judge's party. The mention of
the Standard Oil Company, in this
connection is - the first denial the
Democratic candidate has made to
the charge that' the Standard Oil
Company was preparing to assist fin
ancially toward his election. Said
Judge Parker: * Â«
Even the students in our colleges ' have been
Invited to become strenuous. A little investi
gation or knowledge serves to show that the
college student has always been so. But In
what direction? He has been devoted to his
studies, as our scholarship end our universal
education attest. Nor has this activity been
limited to the few; It has permeated the
masses. It has been an heritable cf the country.
But the student has not accounted U to him
self as & virtue, but as a duty â something he
<we-l to tho society In which "he found himself;
â¢to his parents, who, perhaps, were making
great sacrifices to enable him to be better fit
ted fcr the duties of life and to himself.
This activity goes even farther. unUl we
find that in all the great colleges of -our coun
try now a fourth, now a third, now almost
one-half willingly and cheerfully take up any
klr.3 of employment which can yield sufficient
money to carry them through their college
course, whether academic or professional. You
here-. In Yale have known strong, energetic,
s_ble young men who belonged to families in
whi<-h this process ha* gone on through sev
eral rcnerations. They have furnished to their
country great Jurists and lawyers, great physi
cian*, eloquent divines, who have carried our
traditions Into whatever part cf the world
they have none, and upheld our honor.
Tt,ty have gone forth to found new communi
ties, to proBjcte new business enterprises and
to play a strong and effective part In our life
How" much areatrr activity in this respect Is
demanded by our times than we now show?
Uut even If there were this greater demand
there never was a period when sports were
more universally practiced, or when they were
were rxrftct. Thlc success has not been pur
chased by inefficiency In scholarship. It has
not made our young men swashbucklers . In
We alwtys h*d aa efficient army of brave
â¢oldiers. u*ll commanded. It has been suffi
cient i or our needs that we have been able to
rwist the onslaught of the savage, to ward off
foreign airgression ana to settle our own in
ternal troubles, but this does not seem to sat
isfy. We* must be strenuous, not alone in all
things which make for grood. for safety and
dor permanence, but we ir.uet be strenuous In
advemure, for personal glory and ever looking
for a fight. It is ajjp*reatly not enough that
we shall be active in every moral and religious
mcv^ment. In everything that can promote edu
cation and the discipline of our youths: these
apparently do net ataure real progress. So
we are invited to turn aside from these into
those lines of activity and adventure which
emack cf the crusades and of the times when
the moated cÂ«.3tie was the only home In which
human beings could be fairly said to have Â«.
right to live.^v -..-Â» "Â¦ Â¦*
It has become a fashion during recent years
to exhort our young men to lead what has
been called "the strenuous life." Xot content
with our universal activity and Industry, our
work in the conquest of a continent and the
effort to spread cur popular ideas Into all the
vorld. and thus to make ourselves an example
ii'T other people who are looking toward free
<jm and opportunity, the conclusion seems to
nave b?en reached that somehow we had over
looked something.
Local State issues furnished th.e first
subjects of discussion by the candidate,
after which he took up a number of Is
sues that have formed the topics of
other addresses. One subject was
taken up which was of considerable in
terestâthe development of the Ameri
can merchant marine, and close atten
tion was given the Judge. Militarism,
tariff, trusts and other ipsues were dis
cussed in order. Concerning the "stren
uous life," he said:
The meeting was held in the opera
house, which was filled long before 8
o'clock, the hour set to call the meeting
to order. All entrances were blocked
before the time the candidate was
driven to the opera-house and admit-,
tance was effected with the greStest
difficulty.
DISCUSSES MANY ISSUES.
HARTFORD, Conn., Nov. 3.â Four
enthusiastic audiences greeted Judge
Parker to-day on his only visit to the
State in the campaign, and in several
other places through which his special
train passed he was given rousing im
promptu welcomes. The principal
speech of the trip was in this city to
night, the audience being mainly com
posed of Yale students. Judge Parker's
subject was "The Strenuous Life."
The meeting here was the great
est yet held in Connecticut. When the
special train bearing the Judge and hia
party, the candidates for Governor and
Lieutenant Governor and a special
committee of prominent Senators ar
rived at the Union station several
thousand persons were gathered to
greet the candidate. He was driven
through the crowds to the Hartford
Club. Mhere the Town Committee was
the host at dinner.
Judge Parker repeated his charge
against the administration of the De
partment of Commerce and Labor. ;
. Judge Parker took up the trust ques
tion, . declaring that the tariff made it
possible j for the great combinations to
levy a tax upon every consumer. * He
said: . ., Â¦ â¢ ; .
. Upon these enormous capitalizations the peo
pie, without knowing it, are contributing the
money to pay ' out the dividends- when, they
purchase the necessaries of every-day â¢ use.
The effect has been to Increase the cost of
living more than one-sixth during the last
four years. The Republican leaders say "What
or it? Has not your Iwome increased ; more
than one-sixth during" the last four years?"'
I deny that If this .were true It would con
stitute a defense to such, an imposition â one
that compels :- us td ..par .'"to a home manu
facturer more than 'he is willing to sell the
same thing- for abroad. > But It .iÂ« not true

The administration of Republican principles
has been attended with continuous prosperity
In the United- States. - It Is far from -my In
tention to weary you with a long list of figures
and statistics, : when your own personal knowl
edge enables you to fully comprehend the mag.
nltude of that prosperity. Statistics have been
compiled " which I will be delighted to show

Mr. Kahn was followe'd by A. Van

did opportunity for civil engineers the
occupation of the Philippines by the
United States had developed.. He told
of many young men' that have gone
there and won distinction in their pro

Philip Anspacher, who, though, it was

regardingUhe Philippines:
We do not wish the crime of 1S92 repeated,
and for this reason we must not only, elect
Theodore Roosevelt, but we must elect a Re
1 ubliean Congress. We must elect Julius
Kahn because he will not only aid the Presi

the future with that fidelity that' marked his
course Jn the pas>t.
MUStf ELECT KAHN.
George Benham, secretary of the
State Federation of Labor, was the
next speaker, and he won the approval
of the audience by his sincere support
of the candidacy of Julius Kahn. In
part he said: *
I am. particularly interested In the election
of Julius ;Kahn for three reasons, but I will
only talk to you of the first, "which In Itself
Is sufficient. This Â¦ reason is that during his
term in' Congress there wu no measure â¢ that
would benefit the Jeople of either the 8tate
or the nation that he did not support. I am
not here to make a plea to any class, but to
make a plea to you all and tell you that In

PERSONAL.
The Supervisors' ! Fire Committee
yesterday resumed consideration of
the proposed ordinance requiring that
when roofs are damaged to the extent
of 40 per cent they shall be repaired
with fireproof materials only. Thom
as E. Curran, representing 3000 prop
erty owners, and F. H. Qualman of
the Builders' Association opposed the
ordinance, while Rudolph Herold and
W. J. Dutton on behalf of the insur
ance men and Chief Engineer Dough
erty and Fire Marshal Towe for the
Fire Department urged its passage.
The committee postponed action until
next Thursday morning.
The committee reported in favor of
the. erection of a fire engine and a
chemical house on Twentieth street,
near Connecticut, at a cost of $8000.
Of this amount $4000 will be'takeji
from this year's funds and an appro
priation of $4000 will be made in the
budget of 1904-1905.

Against 'the Requirement for

Roncovieri denied Brandenstein's as
sertion that the effect of the amend-
"The point is not well taken," said
Brandenstein. "We will have enough
money, to repair the schools next year."
"Will you give it to us?" asked Ron
covieri.
"No," said Brandenstein. "We are
sometimes guided', by the incumbents
of an office before â¢ making appropria
tions therefor."
Braunhart thought the fact that only
14,271 citizens voted at the last charter
amendment election was an argument
against submitting the school amend
ments at once. He took the ground
that the 512,000 for a \ special election
could not legally be' taken out of the
urgent necessity fund. and that an in
junction would He lf.lt was. Ronco
vieri declared that the Supervisors had
been very liberal in the past with the
fund.
"I would like to ask why this board
used the urgent necessity fund to pay
$64 for bonfires, $72 for hack hire, $200
for flowers and to pay for ice and
other trivial matters,", said Roncovieri.
"The extremely sacred character of the
fund is not apparent. If these amend
ments are not submitted you will "con
tinue to . have "poor , schcolhouses.' Be
fair In this matter, t- Give | the people a.
chance to vote on^ the '
Chairman'* BrandenstelnV- announced
that the issue before the committee
was whether\the amendments, should
be submitted at a special Â¦ election. . A.
M. Armstrong,, a public school-teacher,
argued that it was obligatory 'on- the
board Ho submit the amendments at a
special election. Cameron King urged
that the amendments giving shorter
hours and a half holiday on Saturday
to city employes and increasing the
salaries of fifteen deputy registrars to
$1500 be also submitted, as the Supreme
Court's decision prevented them being
voted on next Tuesday.
Miss J. E. Watson and Miss E. Moore
urged that the deplorable condition of
the schools demonstrated the need
of submitting the amendments to,pro
vide funds for repair and construction
of schoolhouses.
"This board has reasonable time to
take action In order â¢ that the next
Legislature may ratify the amend
ments," said Costello. "If you refuse
to act you simply set yourself above
the constitution."
Tbe joint â¢ Committed on. Chatter
Amendments, ?. Public Utilities ...and
Finance . yesterday reported against
the boldlns of - a special election oh
January 5 next for the submission of
proposed chaxttr amendments affecting
the adminiBtration of the public school
department and thÂ« other twenty-two
amendments denied a place on the bal
lot at next Tuesday's election by, the
Supreme Court. The committee also
recommended that all. the amendments
be e .bmltted at the . general election
of November. 1906. In all , likelihood
the Board of Education will mandamus
the Supervisors ! to" compel the holding
of a special election for the purpose.
President Roncovieri of the Board of
Education read from the State consti
tution to show that the Supervisors
must submit such charter amendments
as are petitioned for. by more than 15
per cent of the qualified electors.
Chairman Brandenstelh said the com
mittee recognized that the amendments
would have t(y be submitted, but held
that, the e'emtnt of time was a factor
in the matter. ,
Stephen V. Costello, attorney for the
Board of Education, read from a de
cision in a Texas case. that it is manda
t ry on the Supervis-.o to hold an
election ior propo; als to amend the
charter. Costello said that it would
be an evasion of the law for the Super
visors to refuse to accede to the de
mands of more than 30,000 vt ters.
Braunhart held that it is within the
discretion of the board to determine
whether' the amendments should be
voted on at a general or special elec
tion. . . : .- T ;^::i : " . -

H'r-art affections -still not get well of
thPm'sPlvMs; neither do they remain In-
active. If the cause Is not removed they
continue to grow In number and severity.
They are the outgrowth of exhausted
nerve forc<\ and the heart cannot stop to
rest, ess do the other organs, but -must
continue, to strug-gle until completely
disabled, andâ that's the end.
On the very first indication of heart
trouble, you can stop all progress and
effect a cure by the ufie of
Dr. Miles' Heart ;Cvre
The most effective heart remedy known.
It builds up. feeds and strengthens the
nerves and muscles of the heart, and re-
stores It to perfect health.
"I had serious heart trouble; for two
months my life seemed to han* by a

Surprises Her Friends
BERKELEY, Nov. 3.â Captain J. T.
â¢Nance, military instructpr at the uni
â¢ versity, whose authority was yesterday
defied in extraordinary fashion by the
' seniors of the college, is preparing a
report of the affair, which he will trans
mit to President Wheeler. It will eive
an account of the t/eatment CaDtain
Nance's order received by the seniors,
Â»ho are members of his class.
â¢â¢Until my report is sent to President
Â¦ Wheeler and acted upon by him." said
Captain Nance to-day, "1 am not at
liberty to discuss the demonstration
tnade yesterday. I do not wish to be
interviewed."
The question agitating the students,
pending the receipt by President Whee
ler of Captain Nance's report, is the
â¢possibility of punishment for those
students who were ringleaders in the
riotous protest against the captain's
. marching orders yesterday. Rumors
"were spread on the campus to-day that
some men had been summoned to ap
. pear before the students* affairs com
mittee of the faculty and there jrive ac
count of the doings in which they took
a prominent part.
Professor W. A. Setchell. whose at
tempts to quell the mutiny failed in
gloriously, and who was pelted with
clod's and grass, declined to talk. He
is a member of the students' affairs
committee of the faculty, and it was in
that capacity that he addressed the re
bellious seniors and under classmen
yesterday afternoon.
'Did you not say that there would
be more to come in the affair?" was
asked of Professor Setchell.
"â¢I must be excused from answerlne
any questions whatever," he replied.
President Wheeler "pooh-poohed"
the entire affair, saying that it was
scarcely entitled to be called an "ebul
lition."
. "I was in the city when It occurred."
he said, "and so got only a second
hand report of It from a cood man who
brought the news up to my house. I
flon't think there will be any seauel to
It. I suppose it will settle itself, if It Is
.â¢not already settled."
Eugene Hallett, a prominent senior,
who assisted In quelling the mutinous
students yesterday, said to-day:
'There is likely to be a revulsion of
feelinir in the case of Captain Nance.
He will be respected for insisting that
-iiis orders be obeyed, and if he stays I
Â¦pTedict that h*Â» will, in a year or two.
become one of tbe most popular in
structors at the university. It should
be understood that the greater part of
-the demonstration was caused yester
day, not by the seniors, but the under
classmen, who had gathered to 'Josh*
;the seniors when they lined up. ac
cording to orders, to march Into North
for instruction. I, as a senior.
'*"Â«Â» â¢willing to stand any of the 'Josh
.Ing,' It went a little too far. however.
â¢and became more than a 'Josh.' I
think there will be no unpleasant sequel
attending it. however." ,
â¢ W. H- Dehm. president of the Asso
ciated Students, said that no action
was beinsr taken by the faculty or the
Associated Students' officials that he
"knew of to investigate or pursue the
matter further. It would be allowed
to drop, he thought.
â¢ A week is to elapse before the stu
dents will be again required to march.
nccording to Captain Nance's orders.
"Ihto his classroom, his classes beine
-he!d on Wednesday afternoon of each
Â«eÂ»k. It is predicted by the college
authorities that fÂ»ext week the stu
dents will quietly obey the orders of the
commandant, and that there will be no

OAKLAND, Nov. 3. â Hans Clemen
sen, a shoemaker, was In the Police
Court to-day on a charge of striking
Louis Burke, 11 years old, on the
head with a hammer. Burke saw
Clemensen .in San Francisco and
caused his alleged asasilant's arrest.
The trouble occurred several months
ago and the shoemaker disappeared.
He sold out his business in West Oak
land and let the story go that he had
departed for foreign lands. The case
was continued until Saturday.
The Gunters are young and have
two children. The wife alleges that her
husband has been drinking heavily
and when intoxicated has treated her
cruelly and that on one occasion he
drove her out of their home at mid
night shortly before the birth of their
first baby. She also says that on a $20
weekly salary he played the races and
got so badly in debt that he owed $350
after, the season and v thatÂ° she , had to
go to her sister's to/live in order to
give him a- chance to* square up. '..;:'Â¦ '}
; The- proposal to compromise .-"came
from him to-day. Attorneys on both
sides of the case and Judge Ellsworth
all endeavored .to arrive at a satisfac
tory conclusion, but the youpg wife
said .she had lost confidence in her
husband's ability to reform or to keep
the promises he made and refused to
consent to any compromise looking to
the resumption of marital relations. â¢
Testimony in rebuttal was then
taken and the case submitted. Judge
Ellsworth will render a decision next
Thursday morning.
After spending the entire morning in
trying to effect - a compromise with
Amelia C. Gunter, who Is suing Wil
liam Qunter for. a divorce, it was an
nounced by attorneys that no satisfac
tory arrangement could be agreed. upon
and that the attempt to end the suit
had failed. ' Following this announce

ALAMKDA, Sov. 3.â Local Republi
cans will hold their last rally of the
campaign to-morrow nisht in the West
tend Wigwam. The meeting has been
arranged under the direction of Joseph
B. l>anktrce. a member of the county
central committee. There will be the
usual bonfire, brass band and vocal se
lections by the Elks' Quartet. Hon.
Joseph R. Knowland,. J. Clem Bates
and Captain M. \V. Simpson will be the
principal speakers.
On next Thursday evening the West
End . Improvement Association will
hold a ratification reception In honor
of Messrs. Knowland, Simpson and
Bates. Governor George C. Parde<?
and other prominent Republicans have
been Invited . to . participate, and. the
State's executive has sent word that
he will be present.
The largest meeting that has been
held in the southern part of Alameda
County took place last night at Cen
terville, the home of Supervisor C. F.
Homer. Hon. J. R. Knowland, the Re
publican nominee for Congress, was
present and said a' few- good -words for
E. K. S trow bridge, the Republican
nominee for Assemblyman In that dis
trict; J: G. Mattos, the Republican
nominee for Senator and Supervisor C.
F. Homer. Both Mr. Homer and Mr.
Mattos are residents of Center ville, and
they were given an ovation. . :
Supervisor M. D. Rowe has an easy
fight. He has ably represented his dis
trict for eight years and has been In
dorsed by his; own ward, the Seventh,
in royar style; ,...' â¢ ' ., >
There is to be a big smoker at West
Oakland Â¦ in Alcatraz Hall to-morrow
evening, to be addressed by Hon. J. R.
Knowland. John Mitchell. J. J. Burke
and Phil M. Walsh, candidates for the
Assembly, and many prominent local
Republicans. This is to be one of the
tig joint meetings under the auspices
of both the Congressional and county
committees.
Alden was invaded by the Republi
can hosts last night and addresses
were made by P. M. Fisher. J. W.
Jones, Mark Streiter. Peter J. Crosby
and John Mitchell. There Is very lit
tle question about this portion of Mr.
Mitchell's district.
To-night there were two rallies In
the district represented by John Mitch
ell. The one at Milton Hall was in Mr.
Mitchell's home section, and was large
ly in his interests. There were ad
dresses' by Charles E. Snook, attorney
for the Regents of the State Univer
sity, and Peter J. Crosby, while Mr.
Mitchell himself said a few words to
his neighbors. Mr. Mitchell was in
dorsed most heartily.
The West End Colored Republican
Club gathered to-night at 1636 Seventh
street to listen to addresses by prom
inent Republicans. The colored people
of Oakland declared for* Mr. Mitchell
for Supervisor. Â¦ I
These three men have been cam
paigning their respective districts, and
the character of their meetings has
been a guarantee of. the outcome of
next Tuesday's election.. /These , meet-:
ings have been large, of the.most,en
thusiastic kind and have been a hearty
indorsement of the administration of
the candidates.' V" :
All the local interest in the Repub
lican ranks Is centered around tho
three fights for Supervisor. The Re
publican , party has nominated three
men who have been tried, whose rec
ords are before the people and whose
honest administration of county af
fairs justifies the party in again sub
mitting their names for tUe votes of
the peopleâ C. P. Homer in the First
District, II. D. Rowe in the Fourth
District and John Mitchell in the Fifth
District.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Nov. 3. â¢
. An instance of both her drinking and
her associates when out for a "time"
was told by II. J. O'Dea, who conduct
ed a corner grocery In West Oakland
several years ago. He testified that he,
Mrs. Buller and. the colored coachman
often repaired to, a barber shop* adjoin
ing his store and- had>\"tea"- together
there.v She would then drive about in a
hack and go from one resort to another.
One morning she was found in the rail
road yards in West Oakland after a
wild night spent in drinking, and she
was taken to the Receiving Hospital.
Dr. S. H. Buteau, who examined her
upon that occasion, said he found her
suffering from excessive drinking. Her
clothing was dishevelled and she was
suffering ,from chronic alcoholism. A
long liquor bill was also introduced,
showing that she apent during a short
time she had her freedom $4 a day for
liquors. Â¦ -
The testimony was finished by noon
to-day, and in the afternoon Attorney
R. M. Fitzgerald addressed the Jury for
his client, George T. Wright, who as
guardian of Lady Buller fought the
proceedings. He was followed by-At
torney Peter F. Dunne,- who closed for
the plaintiff. The case, as expressed by
several of the Jurors afterward, went
off on the question of her moral respon
sibility.' From the 'testimony the Jurors
were fully satisfied that in this regard
she was not competent to manage her
self or her affairs. .. . . . â
She is both rational and irrational. She
has a good memory and no hallucinations, yet
she has no conception of the value of money
or . ideas as to proper associates. She cannot
be trusted in the selection of her friends.
Morally I consider her Insane. She is utterly
unable to stand alone morally, and if she
were left alone she would return to her old
habits in twenty-four hours. I am satisfied
she would take to excess in liquor again.
Impressed with the testimony offered
as to her inability to choose her friends
well and leave intoxicants alone, a Jury
found . Lady Yarde Buller incompetent
this afternoon and denied her petition
to be restored to capacity. The verdict
was arrived at within" fifteen minutes
after retiring, it needing but a three
fourths vote for a verdict. The jurors
stood ten against her petition and two
for granting it
j It was shown to-day by the testimony
of Dr. John Robertson of Llvermore, at
whose sanitarium Lady Buller has lived,
that he does not dare to trust her to go
about without an attendant. While be
lieving her rational to some extent, he
said: .... ;

nians were sig&aily honored by the award cf
ma&y gold, silver and bronze medals, but the
French Jury probably knew more than Mr.
High about the difference between "Juice'* and
a sound, matured, first-class wine. , .
At the Pan-American â¢ International Exposi

larly rectgnlzed by substantial awards, but
they probably omitted to call in Mr. High as
aa "expert." While at the Louisiana. Pur

Mr. Morgan calls attention to the fact
that at the Paris Exposition in France
in 1900, France being the center of the
world's fine red wines, California na
were signally honored by the award of
many gold, silver and bronxe medals
by a French jury, that probably knew
more than Mr. High about the differ
ence between "juice" and a sound, ma
tured, first-class xrtne; that at the Pan-
American International Exposition Cal
ifornia wines were recognized by sub
stantial awards, and that at the St.
Louis Exijositlon an international jury,
more than four-fifths of the members
of the Jury being foreigners, California
was awarded for wines and brandies
four grand prtxes, fourteen gold, eleven
silver and five bronze medals, or a total
of thirty-four awards, as against one
grand prize, six. gold, six silver and
four bronze medals, a total of but sev
enteen, awards to Eastern wines.
This testimony of competent, disin
terested jurors should, better than any
Â¦srritten refutation from an interested
source, give the lie to Mr. High's intem
perate and biased criticism," says Mr.
Morgan.
Mr. Rossi says that California wines
that are marketed compare favorably
â¢with any wines that are made in
France. Italy, Spain. Germany or in the
Eastern States, notwithstanding Mr.
High's absurd remarks ; also that "we
are exporting large quantities -of our
wine3 to England. Germany and Switz
erland, where the most stringent pure
food laws are in force, and the con
noisseurs of the world would not take
our wines and pay more for them than
for their own products unless they
proved superior, in quality and purity."
Mr. Bundschu says that the sweeping
assertion of adulteration is a malignant
falsehood; that. the assertion that Cali
fornia, wines cannot be shipped safely
In their first or second - year without
preservatives shows gross ignorance or
a. malevolent spirit. "Mistakes have
been made in California, and probably
are still made, but not on the lines to
provoke such unmitigated, unscholarly
and unintelligent criticism.**
JUSTIFY STATE'S FAME.
Percy T. Morgan, president ol the
California Wine Association; P. C.
Rossi, president of the Italian-Swiss
Colony at Asti. having huge plants at
Asti. at Madera. and in San Francisco,
and Charles Bundschu. president of the
Gundlach-Bundschu "Wine Company
and chairman of the California com
mittee of the viticultural exhibit at the
St. Louis Exposition, have been inter
viewed.
In the attack that High made upon
the California wine industry hei said
that California dealers are using sali
cylic acid in the wines that they send
East; that there is not sufflcient cellar
room in California "to hold their juice
until it is true wine**; that shiploads of
"juice" are going from California to
France, there to be rebottied with
adulterants in the French laboratories
and reshipped to America to be sold
under French labels at higher prices
than the similar wine direct from Cali
fronia brings; that California is not
going about winemaking in an honest
and substantial way; that "not one
drop of 'true wine' â that is. the prop
erly matured article â is shipped from
California." Other statements are made
aa ridiculous as the foregoing.
In a recent Issue of The Call the wine
men of California had an opportunity
to see what they have to confront in
the East. The St. Louis correspondent
of this paper Interviewed A- J. High, a
winemaker of New York, who assumed
to have superior knowledge concerning
wineinakins in the United States, and
In California la. particular. The lead
ing wine men of this State declare, and
bring the strongest possible proof to
sup'port their assertions, that High's
statements are a series of misrepre
sentations.

THE BOOT OF THE MATTER-
He Ctxred Himself of Serioos Stomach
. Trouble by Getting Down to
First Principles.
â¢ a man of larse affairs in one of our
rrosusect Eastern cities, by too dose
attention to business, too little exercise
"and too ni*r:y club dinners, finally be-
gan to pay catcre's tax. levied in the
Jcrra cf. chronic stomach trouble; the
tailcre of his digestion brought about
a nervous irritability, making: it impos-
sible to apply Mm self to his daily busi-
ness and finally deranging the kidneys
and heart.
Â¦ In his own words he savs: "I con-
. Â«ulted one physician after another and
each one seemed to understand my
casÂ«. but all the same they each failed
to briny about the return of my former
di^estien, appetite and vigor. For two
â¢jrears I went from pillar to post, from
c-e sanitarium to another. I gave np
smoking. I quit coffee and even re-
nounced my daily glass or two of beer,
but without any marked improvement.,
â¢ '"Friends had often advised me to. try
a well-known proprietary medicine,
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, and I had
often perused the newspaper advertise-
ment* of the remedy, but never took
any stock tn advertised medicines nor
co~uid believe a fifty-cent patent medi-
cine would touch my case.
"To make a long story short I finally
bÂ«rusht a couple cf packages at the
nearest drug store and took two or
three tablets after each meal and occa-
sionally a tablet between meals when I
felt any feeling of nausea or discom-
- - rt BPVHHnflBPfPVM
"I was rurprised at the end of the
.first week to note a marked improve-
ment In my appetite and general health
and before the two packages were gcae
â¢ I was certain that Stuart's Dyspepeia
"Tablets was guinjr to cure completely
and they did not disappoint me. I can
eat and sleep and enjoy my coSee and
cigar and co oae would suppoee I had
ever known the horrcrs of dyspepsia.
**Otrt of friendly curiosity I wrote to
the proprietor* of the remedy asking
fur information as to what the tablets
. ccntained and they replied that ' the
. principal ingredients were aseptic pep-
sin fjrovernment test), malt diastase
' acd other natural digestives, which di-
cest food regardless ot the condition of
the ' rtcirach."*
The " root of the matter is this, the
digestive elements contained in. Stuart'a
Dyspepsia Tablets will digest thÂ« food.
gtve.the overu-orW stomach a chance
to recuperate and the nerves and whole
system receive the nourishment which
can enly come from food; stimulants
and n#rve tonics never give real
strength; they give a fictitious strength
invariably foUc-wed by reaction. Every
drop of bJood, every nerve and tissue is
manufactured from our daily food and
if you can insure its prompt action and
cestpiete digestion by the regular* use
of so good and wholesome a remedy as
Stuarts DysrÂ«psia Tablets, you will
have ho need of nerve tonics and sanl-.
tariums.
Although Stuart's Dyspepsia . Tablets
have been in the market only ; a , few
years, yet probably every druggist in

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
PASSPORT^ TO RUSSIA.
RUSSIA has heretofore refused to recognize the right of Jews
to expatriate themselves. When a Russian Jew, naturalized
in the United States, returned to the empire with an American
passport, he found that his American citizenship was no protection
to him and his life and liberty were in peril. This was especially
hard on the Jews of .Poland, who, like all the Poles, are unwilling
subjects of the Czar. But their feelings in the matter were not con
sulted by that autocrat, and American citizenship was insulted by
him in denying its efficacy when bestowed upon self-expatriated
Tews. teJ^ T WittfiMH I
President Roosevelt and Secretary Hay have set about ending
this' religious discrimination among American citizens. It is tli2
most offensive of all discriminations. A member of the orthodox
Russian church, naturalized in this country, could safely return to
Russia protected by an, American- passport, while a Jew under-ths
same circumstances returned at his peril. At last the case of the
Jews has been put to the Czar in terms so positive as affecting the
national dignity of the United States by denial of the efficacy.of cit
izenship in this republic that the Czar has weakened and yielded.
When the present negotiation is ended a Russian Jew, panoplied
by American citizenship, protected by an American passport, can
visit his home and his people without risk or peril. -The dignity of
citizenship has been vindicated by President "Roosevelt, and now
there is no part of the earth where it is safe for a foreign power to
disrespect John Hay's passport and the great seal of the. United
States. It is a conspicuous triumph of American .diplomacy, ot
human' rights and of religious liberty. V~*V.^

DEFINITION OF A BLUSH. Â»
SWEETS FOR VOTERS 'WIVES
Cashmere is back again with a great
er prestige than when it left. It has \
many qualities that adapt rt to the
present fashionâ a highly finished sur-*
face, suppleness and a long range of
colors, says the New Tork Sun. All the
pew tones are, in fact, out in the old
weaveâ the American beauty shades,
the pretty greens, of which almond,
bronze and lichen are just now the most
popular; all the browns, including the
favorite mole and cinnamon; the blues,
with Paxsifal leading them, and the
purples, dahlia and- ''copper* shades.
With the old fabric again 'regnant it is
consistent that black velvet should re- j
turn to the front' for trimming, and It is [
here touching up silks, cloths and even ;
gauzes. For tbe bisque and pink and
ether r-ale tinted cashmeres no trim-!
rning is better suited than black velvet,
especially If a note of Persian embroid
ery is introduced and there is a gener
ous touch of lace. Especially "for after
noon gowns the revived texture lends
itself to attractive and economical cos
tumes. For simple home dresses many
cashmere skirts are being made to ac
company =ilk blouses that match them
in shade. And here is a new fancy for
cashmere skirts. When there is full- i
ness to be brought into the waistband, J
very flat, overlapping lingerie tucks are
employed to do the work of fitting and
shaping at belt and hips.
A pretty cashmere frock has a skirt
whose only decoration Is these tucks,
forming a yoke shape at the top. The
waist is dne of the draped surplice
bodices, with high silk girdle and flow
ing elbow sleeves. The unders of the
sleeves are composed of numerous puffs
ending' at the hands in narrow frills of
the silk and wide frills of lace. A nar
row puff of silk the shade of the cloth
outlines the self-colored lace yoke of the
bodice.
These narrow puffs, boulllonnees, as
the French dressmaker calls them, are
as much used now as- in the spring.
They trim skirts, bodices, evening coats
and wraps and even tbe wide brims of
big velvet hats. Another vogue to con
tinue is -the use of upstanding ruffles
and plaitings. These appear at the
head of nun's folds, other bands and
flounces.
In the gown of the blue chiffon broad
cloth the use of the puff is well illus
trated. An undulating shirred band
edged with velvet folds 'hems the
flounce of the skirt.' The bolero, tucked
at the shoulders, ends at the girdle in a
curlycue of. puffs.
The little jacket: next it also shows a
popular treatment, fancifully shaped
bands of the material stitched.
The half-length suit coat. is the lead
er among plain tailor-mades. But for
the woman of abbreviated stature there
are shorter shapes that are far more
becoming. The woman with hips too
large in proportion for her other dimen
sions will do well to avoid the tight
fitting basque; coat tliarends at the
hips or below them. It accentuates the
girth at that point. For such figures
there are half T fltting coats far and
away more becoming to those who have
lost their girlish .figures.

Â¦ Editor Call: Having* read In your
issue of "November 2 your unfavorable
comment on the proposed constitution
al amendment to exempt from taxation
the -California Academy of Sciences, 1
desire to s'ubmit to you the following
statement:
The California Academy of Sciences
is an Institution quite as deserving of
exemption from taxation as are Stan
ford University and the ebcrches. in
stitutions already exempted/^ The lib
erality of our State in respect to edu
cation, which has characterized it from
the very beginning. Is one .' of :tfcÂ«s" chief
glories of' California. " No Â¦* Calif ornian
can be opposed to the free offer, of an
education to every child in the State.
The work of the academy is exclu
sively educational, and is as exclusive
ly for public as contradistinguished
from private purposes as is the work
of the public schools, while at the
same time the academy did not cost
the public a dollar, nor is it receiving
or asking for any public support,, as
are the public schools.
It is founded chiefly on the j philan
thropic benefactions of James Lick.
and is, and has been from its, start, de
voting every dollar of its income to
public educational purposes, such as
maintaining excellent and constantly
growing scientific collections always
open and free to> every man, woman
and child that desires to examine ' or
study them; also in printing, publish
ing and distributing throughout the en
tire civilized world the labors of scien
tific men from all parts of the State.
and in sending out. as far as its means
win admit, exploring expeditions for
the purpose of adding' to our knowl
edge and keeping pace with advancing
civilization. ',
To carry on this work, much " of
which is done by public spirited citi
zens gratuitously, requires money. Just
as the public schools require money.
But the difference is that the academy
is asking no public aid in the same
sense as are the public schools. All it
asks Is that it may be allowed to usÂ«
all its income for the. purpose of ex
tending its public usefulness.

A PLEA FOR THE ACADEMY.
CASHMERE BACK AGAIN.
OUR INTERESTS IN CONGRESS.
p>|RACTICAL efficiency is the test of a Congressman's fitness.
r-V San Francisco needs that sort of ' efficiency in the House.
* Without it she lags behind her rivals on the coast, and
marches in the rear of the procession of American cities. No one
need to be told that this city was de'prived of efficient representation
in the last session of the House.. Messrs. Livernash and. Wynn did
not prove themselves capable in practical legislation. If we got
any benefit out of the session it was bestowed by others and not by
them. The Representatives of other districts in the* State "had their
hands full in caring for their own constituents. It is a fact that they
were appealed to to do something for San Francisco, but their in
itiative would have required explanation involving the condemnation
of our two members.
The error, in failing to have a proper representation, was the
act of the voters of this city, and it is theirs to correct. Even the
special class of which our two members esteemed themselves the
j-gents and representatives gained nothing by them, and will gain
nothing if they are re-elected. A member of Congress must -have
equipment beyond a bulging desire for social reforms. Society as it
is was made by the friction and conflict of ages. No human society
has ever been perfect. The attempts at perfection made in Socialist
communities have always failed to effect their purpose. How idle is
it then to elect men to Congress in the expectation that they will per
fect a social structure that is not corrigible by the efforts of re
formers in a restricted and exclusive community, supposed to be at
one in its plans for reformation.
A great commercial center like San Francisco cannot afford to
dissipate its opportunity and divert its energies by electing its sole
Representatives for the purpose of social experiment, or to carry into
law the greeds and grudges, the avarice and spites, that are insepara
ble from the programme of social reformers, who expect to correct in
a day, by statute, a society that is the natural 'result of ages. Ye:
this is what we are asked to do by re-electing Messrs. Livernash and
Wynn. If those gentlemen are to be judged by their own declara
tions, their mission is agitation of social reforms by academic dis
cussion, for which the House of Representatives is not the proper
field. They have sat in one session of Congress and brought nothing
home of value or consequence to their constituents. Having been
tested and found wanting in practical legislative ability, their service
should be terminated and others of known merit and usefulness sent
in their places. '
. Compared with their opponents they disappear as fit instruments
of the purposes and needs of a great city. They are not men of
affairs. Their fortunes are not a part of the active enterprise of the
community. They are, in experience, strangers to the great energies
that move the community forward.- They are in the field of theory
and dreams, not that of activity and accomplishment. Mr. E. A.
Hayes, the Republican* nominee against Mr. Wynn, has embarked
his material interests with those of his fellow citizens. He is a
practical fruit-grower, an active owner of business property. If bad
legislation touch his neighbors, it touches him. If good legislation
and needed Government attention be given to practical business that
benefits him, its benefit to his constituents is equal. He is a good
citizen, an upright and able man. He impresses his associates and
has the interest in all men that attracts sympathy and friendship.
In Mr. Wynn's interest a campaign of abuse and misrepresentation^
has been waged against him b>; Mr. Hearst. It has been malicious,
false and outrageous, and its purpose is to deprive the Fifth District
and this city of a Representative who will do the things San Fran
cisco requires in order to continue in the House a Representative
who has done nothing "and will do nothing.
The people of the district will greatly dignify themselves by
vindicating Mr. Hayes against the reckless slanders and "mud
slinging that have been used against him. If they permit Mr. Hearst
to smut out of public life a man like Mr. Hayes, let us hear "no more
about the duty of decent men in politics.
Mr. Kahn needs no introduction to San Francisco. His oppo
nent. Mr. Livernash, has descended to personal slurs against him,
but the people have their records for comparison. Mr. Kahn servejtl
his constituency two tcrYns in the House, and while he represented
the district no interest of San Francisco lacked attention and no ap
peal went unanswered. He was a popular member, to whom the
House listened, and whose efforts, for his own people rallied help
from both parties. He did not wrap himself, in a mantle of exclu
siveness and self-sufficiency. He was responsive, friendly and ap
proachable, and above all had an intimate personal knowledge of the
needs of San Francisco and California. A. man of affairs himself, he
considered it his duty to make a personal study and investigation of
great national matters, and used his leisure in gaining. information
that enriched his equipment as a national legislator. He was able to
meet on equal .terms the ablest men in the House of either party and
was in all respects a model Representative. Where Mr. Livernash
has reveries, Mr. Kahn has action. While Mr. Livernash dreams of
a social Utopia, Mr. Kahn does tbe duty of to-day in behalf of the
social structure that is.
We cannot believe that the people of this city will any longer
chase phantoms and imagine voices, but we have faith that they will
elect Mr. Kahn and Mr. Hayes and secure the practical working rep
resentation which San Francisco needs.

to on August 12. the defendant was
held to answer by Police Judge Conlan
on October 12, and the information was
filed on October 23, one month "M four
day* after the time had elapsed. It is
no fault of the District "Attorney*! of
fice, as. the time had eiapaed before
the defendant was held to answer.
Judge Lawior has continaed the case
mi November 7 for argument on the
demurrer, but it is acknowledged that
the point is wen taken. It will prob
ably be made a feature in the argu
ment en an application for a writ of
habeas corpus for Dr. Brennan's re
lease to take place before Judge Cook
to-day.
From developments yesterday It
looks as if Dr. Themas F. Brennan will
escape trial on * charge of grand lar
ceny through some one's blunder.
\Tten the case was called before Judgj
Lawior, defendant's attorney, W.' M.
Cannon, interposed a demurrer to the
information on various grounds, bet
particularly on the ground that "the
information and any prosecution
thereon is barred because It appears
upon the face of said information that
the alleged offense was committed
more than three years prior to the fil
ing of said information." '
Secticn SCO of the Penal Code reads:
"An indictment for any other felony
than murder or embezzlement of public
money or the falsification of public rec
ords must, be found or an information
filed within three years after its com
mission."
In the complaint charging Dr. Bren
nan with grand larceny the offense
was alleged to have been committed on
September 21. 1501. He was accused of
the larceny of 337,524 from Rev. Father
P. J. Grey. The complaint waÂ» sworn

A suit for J 50,140 damages and a

C Jones, insolvent, was filed In the Su
perior Court yesterday by Samuel
Shear, as administrator of the estate
of Dolores L. Green, in an action
against Thomas P. H. Whitelaw. It
Is alleged that Jones In 1884 gave a
mortgage for $59,000 to A. A. Green,
secured by the Rancho San Rafael de
la Zanja. lying partly in Southern Arf
xona and partly in the State of Sonora.
Mexico. This mortgage, it Is said, was
assigned to Whitelaw, who agreed to
foreclose it and pay J 10.000 for a third
interest in the land which might after
ward be secured. He did not fore
close and 's sued, for the principal aad
interest.

The story of George Ade's comedy
drama, "The County Chairman,** which
Henry W. Savage offers at tie Colum
bia Theater for two weeks beginning
Monday. November 7, Is not at all in
volved. Jim Haekler rules the political
machine In his county and nominates
for State's Attorney young THIford
Wheeler, ~ his law partner. TiUford Is
engaged to be married to Lucy Rigby,
the daughter of old Judge Rigby.'who
is the life-long enemy cf Haekler.
When the Judge hears that THlford ia
going to make the rafe against him he
refuses to permit Lucy to meet the
young lawyer again. Of course, they
do meet, and eventually marry. Hack
ler*s enmity against Judge Rigby is
due to the fact that during the Civil
War days Rigby by lies and deceit won
from him the only woman he ever,
loved. He gets even with Rigby this
timet for his candidate, young Wheeler,
beats the Judge-for the offlce of State's
Attorney In addition to marrying Lucy.
There are more than a hundred people
on the' stage during the performance of
"The County Chairman." ":Â¦--' â¢
The new - management of Fischer's
Theater, which is to reopen the house
wlfh vaudeville at popular prices on
Monday evening, has secured among
other head-liners the Klns-Ners, who
come direct from Paris and have thus
far appeared tn Xew York City only.
They are known to the world for their
marvelous strength as equilibrists, and
it is said to be the only European act
of its kind that has ever been produced
on the vaudeville stage. The man Uft3
and balances on hii chin a road cart
weighing 2S0 pounds. He also climbs up
fourteen tables balancing six glasses on
his forehead. Another feat is the bal
ancing cf a 750-pound t>fano on his
chin, a feat almost inconceivable, bet
which he win accomplish at each per
formance. These are but a few of the
acts that both Mr. and Mrs. KIns-Ner
perform. When It is understood that
Mr. KIns-Ner does not weigh to exceed
123 pound3 and is net more than five
f efet : six . inches in height his sensa
tional and dangerous feats seem almost
beyond comprehenakm. The woman, it
is said, performs all these feats, and

Mrs. Selby's evidence, particularly
under h^z husband's cross-exam
ination, waa interesting, and show
ed her to be highly intellectual
and original In several
sages she had decidedly the best of
her questioner. Referring to her hus
band"** verbal abuse of Christian men

Australia, she said: "If. you have
found three nations of baptized brutea
it Ls because you have looked at them
with your own eyes." Again, when
Selby had asked her to send their chil
dren to the, Unitarian church, she an
swered him: "We don't propose to fol
low your rreanderings. You taught u*
in the Christian church for ten years;
now you have changed to the Unitar
ian, and probably In a few weeks you
will want to expound to the children
tne Darwinian hypothesis.'*
Questioning her upon the promised
that had teen made f> him in Austra-
U*. of a future in this country, Selby
-aid that a world-touring missionary
had called on them tnd told him that
he fSelby) would receive a warm wel
come in America. "Oh, I considered It
simply a conventional courtesy." said
Mrs. Selby. "The other day Mayor
Schmitx told a distins-uished Spanish
visitor that e-v<try house tn the city
was open to him. The Spaniard did

laugh. In which the court Joined, arid
Mrs. Selby continued: **If the gentle
man was making a promise for the en
tire Christian community of America
he could not deliver the goods.**
Reviewing their home affairs. Mrs.
Selby said that aha had contributed
nore ffran her husband to the- domestic
exchequer, and declared that .once,
Â¦chen they gate up their rooms, she
had to give the landlady a velvet dress
for the rent. When they went to liv-i
m a basement on H&ight street, she
said, she gave several dresses as se
cirity for the rent. In that place, she
said, they were In abject need.
When Selby was lecturing in Cin
cinnati, she continued, he accused her
pt intending to poison him when he
found a saucer full of powder used to
polish silver. .At the same place he
declined to attend a banquet of clergy
and church members because he feared
a plot to assassinate him, and told bis
wife if there was such a plot she was
at the bottom cf it- Selby denied this.

Edward â¢' S. ' Planter, a gay young fel
low from. Detroit," who has been cutting
quite a swath' around .the!: local hotels
and the tcndertoln^district for a month;
is now locked, up at, " the^City Prison
awaiting an officer from Detroit, where
he is wanted forj forgery- was
arrested . ypsterday'at the instigation of
Banker . Patterson of Fresno. Several
weeks ago Planter visited the bankeir
In Fresno, to whom'he represented him
self as- Edward _j Patterson,- a second
cousin of \ he financier, and. spent two
days - in Â¦ the raisin \ tov/n ' enjoying the
hospitality of his new made friend. Just
before â¢ the two ; men . parted the young
mah asked Patterson to indorse a $2500
check, which he said an uncle had sent
him and- which., he. was anxious to cash.
Although he had readily obliged his
supposed- relative Banker Patterson
later regretted' his act- and -hia sus
picions being aroused he telegraphed
East 'whence '< came the response that
the check was a forgery. Immediately
on receipt Of this news Patterson, com
municated with the bank in this. city
on which the check was. drawn, and
when, Planter called at the bank the
next morning the cashier told him the
check, would have to be. forwarded for
collection. Evidently realizing that he
was -suspected.' he 'hurriedly' left the
bank.' Sines- then he. has been : having
a wild time about town. For awhile he
was "a guest at the Â§t. Francis Hotel,
where; he was accompanied by a young
woman who was introduced as his wife.
Foun weeks ago Planter gave an 'elab
orate V 1 dinner, to a- party -of .friends
at. the hotel and surprised them by ap
pearing 'â¢ at ithe .dinner dressed as a
Dutch comedian:- From the St.- Francis
Planter and his companion moved to
the.-Hotel Victoria on Geary, street,
where - he ..soop became known as a
lavish â¢ spender. -
;JFor several weeks .Banker Patterson
has bfjndlligeritly searching for Planter
in", this . city arid employed the Pinker
ton, agency, to assist him. : Yesterday,
while taking lunch at Zinkand's with
a friend, the banker, discovered Planter
and his female companion eating at an
adioining. table.. Quietly; leaving the
place, Patterson summoned .two police
men,: who arrived at the resort. Just ; as
Planter was leaving and placed him un
der arrest. His woman companion was
allowed to go herw^j-, but last night
the police decided that she might .be a
valuable witness and officers were sent
out to find her. Up to midnight,.how- ;
ever, she had not returned to her apart
ments at *. the Hotel Victoria. . The ; de
tectives say Planter is well connected in
the East, but their Information is- that
he has been lading a . reckless lit e . and
ftas left bad checks â¢ in a nujnber of
cities which he. has recently visited. .

â Al Herford made a getaway.' for Bal
timore on Wednesday night with a big
wad of San j Francisco . coin.-, Joe Gans
followed his wise j manager; yesterday
morning.
The Britts have dropped suddenly
from sight, Jimmy ' having gone to the
mountains for a rest, while Willis and
James Sr. are keeping much to them
selves. . . . . ' -
It would be better for the promoters
to leave Gans to his terrapin' and his
dice-shaking in Maryland and seek
boxing talent elsewhere., '
Harry Corbett, who looks after. the
affairs of the Yosemite Club, feels.con
fident he wiir secure the_ permit for De
cember, the club being entitled to that
date. He is not prepared to say that
Britt and Gans are on the cards for
that month. .
.When the spectators at. Monday
night's affair" discuss the; quick, action
of the entire spectacle they seem to ar
rive at the conclusion that; it was, too
much like a Central Theater. ,melo :
drama with the rough-house- scene^froni
Jim Corbetfs-play, "Pals," enacted by
Jimmy Britt and; Eddie Graneythn^vn
in. for good measure; It' was -stage
managed to perfection. . from the-dra
matic incidents of the weighing in until
the final curtain. " Al Herford has the
reputation of being a star in this, de
partment of the game, and David Be
lasco could not 'have filled in- the 'de
tails with . greater nicety. That there
v/as a lack of confidence in Herford is
evidenced by the fact that several
heavy wagers were called off at the
eleventh hour by men who were not
sure they would get a run for "their
money. Shortly before the boxers en
tered the ring a number of well-dressed
colored men. appeared in the downtown
cafes and offered to bet in thousands
on Gans. They had the shining gold,tp
place on the man from Baltimore.
The geneml impression seems ..to; be
that the patrons of boxing have ; had . a
surfeit, of Manager Herford * aiid ; 'of
Gans, particularly Herford.. Gans Is re
ported to have" said tp a friend within
fifteen minutes after he ' left the ring on
Monday night that he could .whip Britt
In a round. It Is a matter of rlnghis
tory that he did not do so then. - : :?
The promoters of ; boxing- are feeling
the pulse of ; the public' on the ' Question
of a return, match J between Britt and

As was expected, there were re
versals of recent form, perhaps the
most noted being when Orthodox won
the second race at one mile In 1:38,
making by more than a second the
fastest mile run over this course. Be
cause the second horse. Sidney C.
Love, has hitherto ranked only as a
selling plater, many thought the race,
â¢though run in fast time, was not a
high-class performance. Damon was
a tiring third, while Colonial Girl, the
nominal favorite, was last, although
under one of Odom's most vigorous
rides all the way down the long home
Etretch. Summary:

AQUEDUCT. Nov. 3.â Confined to
much more limited bounds than those
at Jamaica, the racing crowd at Aque
duct track to-day seemed larger than
the crowds recently seen at Jamaica.
The bookmakers' lnclosure was popu
lous and there was a general air of
briskness all about the grounds. Mars
Cassldy's starting was prompt and
pood. The racing was excellent as a
rule.

CHICO, Nov. 3.â An audience that

h'ere to-night. The best people of this
suction occupied the seats and filled the
standing room, listening for an hour
and a half to a splendid resume of the
political, issues of the day. McKinlay
received the closest attention of the
hundreds of voters in the audience and
his telling points were frequently inter
rupted by applause.
Judge Frank f â â¢--* of Fresno fol
lowed with an eloquent address along

spoke to a crowded house at Stirling
City, winning many supporters by the
high plane , of discussion . he assumed
and the eloquent manner in which he
discussed the political issues. The
same effect is evident here to-night,

STOCKTON, Nov. 3.â In a street duel
at Douglass Flat, Calaveras County,
last evening William Harris, a miner,
whose home is in this city, was shot to
death by Owen Roberts." Shortly before
the shooting Harris had made threats
that he would kill Roberts because of
an old- grievance concerning a mining
claim: About four years ago Harris
had bonded a mine belonging to Rob
erts, and the latter had aided "him, but
the mine was a failure and Harris waa
unable to pay Roberts. He offered to
give him the cabin on the property, Dut
Roberts refused to accept it. When
Harris returned to Douglass Flat a few
days ago he began: drinking, and, then
asserted" that Roberts had beaten him
out of his property. Harris also made
threats to kill Roberts, and the friends
of the latter in warning him advised
him to secure a pistol.
When the two met last evening Rob
erts, who Is held in very high esteem,
attempted to argue and explain, but
Harris abused him and finally drew a.
revolver. Roberts was on . his guard
and sent a bullet Into the neck of Har
ris. A second shot missed Harris, while
a third passed through the right lung.
Roberts fired a fourth shot, but it also
missed. Harris did not have time to fire
once, and when picked up still grasped
the loaded revolver. An inquest was
held to-day and Roberts was exon
erated. The -preliminary examination
will be held as soon as possible.

PASADENA, Nov. 3.-:The members
of ' the congregation of the Friendship
Baptist Church of this city, backed by
the leading Baptist preachers of South
ern : Calif ornia, declared last night that
they would take their case into court
in order, to oust Rev. J. D. Bushel!.", who
refuses',' to' resign,', though asked to do
so. - The trouble -. began a year ago,
when Rev. Mr. Bushell declared that his
followers were nottiear enough tg-God.
Later on he 'declared himself a holi
ness preacher, and said that his church
was no longer a Baptist church.; ,'
At a meeting of the congregation Dr.
Bushell . took the I church covenant and
cast It upon the floor and stamped upon
it. Some of, his congregation stood by
him, but' others dropped : out of the
church, while still others were dis
missed. Finally the clerk of the church
was discharged for alleged immoral
conduct and this precipitated the callr
ing of an ex-parte council, of which the
Rev. .Robert J. Burdette of the Temple
Baptist Church, the Rev. C. O. Willett
of the Orchard-avenue \ Baptist Church
of Los Angeles, the Rev. C. H. Hobart
of the Pasadena First Baptist Church
and others were members. Being re
fused by the pastor admittance to the
church the council met elsewhere and
asked for the Rev. Mr. Bushell's resie
nation. The Rev. Mr. Bushell refused
and referred . the matter to a vote of
his congregation to-night. He got a
majority of the votes, but the Baptist
council will take the matter to court
on the. ground^ that the congregation
had no right to vote, be^ng Holiness
and not Baptist worshipers. i

NEW YORK. Nov. 3.â There mas a notable
subsidence of speculative interest In the stock
market to-day. There was evidence in the
larre operations of a few firms, which are
credited with doing the business for some of
the powerful interests that those Interests
wtre Â«1U taking a tpeculative part in the
transactions. Eut their operations were con
r.ned to fewer stocks and were on a smaller
scale than for some time past. Part of them
Â»ere lary* buying orders in the metal stocks
and it was current belief that large selling
orders for purposes cf realising came from the
â¢am* rouroea. Even with the activity of a
fÂ«w special stocks on dealings of this char
acter to-day s aggregate sales fell to the low
r*t figurt; of any day since before the middle
of October and if the general market alone
m considered the trading was actually dull
and the drift of prices very sluggish and
.indifferent. The halt in the activity of the
market Is generally attributed to a purpose
to await tiie Â»a*sare of the election owing
to the proverbial dread of speculators of the
unÂ«*tling effect of that contest and their
inability to estimate mhat will be its effect
*n business and Industry. Such ftrencth as
. ther* was In to-deys market was largely
confined to the iron and 8t*^l Industrials and
here a close relation to the advices from
â¢that trade. Informal intimations were in cir
culation that the orders received by the United
States Steel Corporation were in an incrwisin*
rat* and approaching the limits of productive
capacity. It was pointed out also that the
active demand for pig iron was beginning to
spread to some lines of finished products an
txtension which has not been conspicuous ud
to this time. The United State* Steel stocks
were the most active of the group but some
of the partly dormant stocks made much
better gains. Tennessee Coal rising more than
three and Â£loss-Shef3eId Steel five points. The
â¢ Pennsylvania group of rallroaa stocks showed
sympathy with this strength, es Is usually the
ca*e. owing to the large proportion of their
traffic which is made up of the Iron and steel
The running of the first cars over
the new East River bridge gave a lift to
Rrooklyn Transit. Sugar had the advantage
of a further advance in the price of refined
sugsr. Another rise in copper did not avail
to hold Air.slgamzted. which reacted on profit
â¢taking Â»nd o>nials of the alleged control of
the Heinz-* property In its interest. The Tail
ore of confirmation of deal stories and the
porltiv* denial of them in some cases were
irflufn-^s at other points In the market. Aside
from the stronr points mentioned the market

of leading nocks. TbÂ«se declines were largely
made up and coocverted into gains for a few

of mom* expert estimates of a heavy corn

both th- Bank at England and thÂ« Bank of

ticle was still offering freely, but sold slowly,
and there were several lots on hand that were,
rapidly spoiling. Strawberries and Raspber
ries were steady and Huckleberries were In
better demand and firmer. Several more 'car
loads of Apples were marketed and there were
liberal receipts by water â¢ from Humboldt
County.' The market was weak for fancy
stock, but quotations were unchanged, as most
of the offerings had been purchased at high
prices in the growing districts, which neces
sitated the asking of correspondingly .high
prices here. Grapes were in moderate receipt
and firm, particularly for fancy stock in
crates, which was wanted for shipment on
the Portland steamer. A good demand was
noted for all descriptions of Citrus fruits.
Lemons were closely cleaned np and firm and
well-colored lots of new Navel Oranges met
with ready sale at the top quotations. Illlo
Bananas, ex-steamer, sold on the dock at

received and . they were nearly all too green

There was no further change In Cheese.
The current decline In Butter having brought
prices for fresh creamery squarely down to the
level of Eastern and cold-storage goods, the
demand for the two latter descriptions has
been cut off short as far as the wholesalers
are concerned. The retailers, however, still
hold more- or lesa of these goods, which they
will naturally work off before going back to
the fresh kinds. As soon as these retailers"
stocks are cleared out the wholesalers expect
that the demand for fresh creameries will
Immediately revive and the current accumu
lation be wiped out. But this will take a
little time. 1 Yesterday's market continued de
pressed, with the bulk of the finest creameries
going Â¦ at ' 22c, with sales as low as 21c and
up to 23c. Some very good creamery was
worked off down as low as 20c.

Ttie Lumber Trade.
Pacific Coast Wood and Iron says:
"The Ian month has seen the lumber mar
kets of the Pacific Co&ct Improve from one end
to the other and the prospects for November
appear excellent. Redwood lumber and shin
riea are moving easily, with excellent prices
tr,'. steady demands. Rustic Ftock is scarce.
.Â«i;h a heavy demand, while No. 1 common
r: ~.s a fair call, with No. 2 and 3 common
i cnsiderably o3 In price and demand. The
latter is due greatly to the fact that many
retailers call for good No. 1 and displace
sotne grades of dear with It. Common or
inferior quality runs into close and exhaust
ive competition with the pine from the Noih
â¢ est of cheaper stocks, m-lth the result that
the latter wins out. "Where 30 per cent of
redwood used to be utilised In house trai kites
in this city and vicinity pine is now being
rushed to the extent of 85 per cÂ«it and red
wood suffers in consequence.
'"Redwood shingles are active, with an ex
cellent Eastern demand taking heavy ship
nients of this product. T^exas has recently
ccrne into this .market for the shingles It
r*Â»ver knew Â»bout before, and these increase*
in dPirwmds and the broadening of the red
Â»otxt ehingles" sphere of action can be cred
:t.-d to the . able management of the Shingle
Association. Prices are well sustained and
a possible advance a.t no far distant date can
te^ar.tjeipaied.
'. ' "Reiwood ties have slackened up in de
mand, but this Is fortunate since the stocks
are low cn the Coast, with no prospect for
f-ny excess for sorr.e months to come. Those
are in possession of ties are holding
i-ack for better prices. Shakes are easy with
>everal groan niills lately commencir.g opera
.tions. which means a slight overloading, of
tbm current aearVet. . . .
"Pin* it moving well, with well sus'ained
VrU*M. Building all over the Coast it ac
tive and the demand is consequently normal
and encouraging. Foreign shipments are
as usual for this season of the year and
tte outlook promise further activity The
redwood manufacturers of Mendocino County
have formed an association for export and
â¢ hope to be able to force more remunerative
returns for thel r carr**.

CHICAGO. Nov. 3. â Reports of protracted
wet weather In Argentina brought out a good
demand for wheat when- trading began. As
a result . a , firm . undertone prevailed, initial
quotations on December being unchanged Â¦. to
%c higher at $1 12% to $1 12Vi. May was a
shade lower to %@V4c higher at $1 11% . to
$1 12%. For a time the buying was of \a
lively character, shorts being quite active , on
that side of the market. Slight, advances were
maintained in the price of all deliveries,, both
December and May selling up to $1 12%. At
this point the market was subjected to heavy
selling pressure. The reason, mainly ' given
for the selling was the fact- that reports of
Hessian fly damage in winter wheat bad been
allayed to a considerable extent by reports
to & Cincinnati crop journal. According to
this authority damage to the growing crop
thus far has been comparatively insignificant.
The market was unable to withstand the
weight of offerings and in consequence Decem
ber sold- down to $1 11%. May declined . to
$1 11 V4. Primary receipts _Â¦ were again ' of
'smaller volume than last year's and an active
distribution of wheat : was seemingly In" pro
gress from Western Â¦ market centers to v parts
of the country where there Is a scarcity. The
falling off In receipts * had its effect and on
this Â¦ decline there was enough, wheat wanted
to re-establish the feeling of firmness â¢ with
which business commenced. Drought damage
reports ' continued to . come Â¦ In. * the effect of
which was to stimulate a better demand. .' A
firm tone prevailed at the close. Final quota
tions were \Lc â¢ np. â¢â¢ with December i at $1 - 12%
and on May at $1 17%. ...-

The body of the young man found in
Golden Gate Park last Tuesday with a
bullet wound in his head still lies at the
Morgue unidentified. Last evening two
boys, William McCarray and Thomas
Mellick of 668 Clementina street, called
at the Morgue and stated that the body
resembled that' of Earl Hamilton, whose
parents live at Twenty-seventh and
Sanchez streets. The boys said that
Hamilton took dinner with the Mellic'ks
Sunday afternoon and during the meal
remarked that he was going to kill
himself because his father had turned
against him. The elder Hamilton
could not be found last night by the
deputies of the Morgue who were. sent
out to bring him in for the purpose of
viewing and if possible Identifying the
remains as those of his son.
The strange actions of the woman
who has been calling at the Morgue
daily and decorating the remains with
flowers led to an investigation of her
identity yesterday and resulted in the
discovery that she is Mrs. Bertha Con
ness. The latter declared that she has
no knowledge as to the Identity of
the dead man and had simply been at
tracted to the Morgue through sym
pathy, aroused over the story publish
ed regarding the finding of the body in
the park.
Mrs. Conness* sister, Mrs. C. G.
Conna, who lives in East Oakland,
stated last night that Mrs. Conness had
admitted to her that the dead man
was an old acquaintance of hers, a
man whom she had known In Arizona.
The sister added that she knew that
Mrs. Conness had lived with a bar
tender named Frank Wilder in Doug
las, Ariz., for seven years. They were
not married, but Wilder continued to
send her sister money after the latter
had removed to this State. Finally
they had a falling out.
Mrs. Conness has been living at the
Cummlngs house at 618 Post street,
this city, but inquiry there last night
revealed the fact â¢ that she had left
there yesterday. Â¦
Mrs. Elizabeth Coleman of 1217
Mission street viewed the body in the
forenoon, and with loud lamenta
tions proclaimed the dead man to be
her brother, Alexander Henry Don
nelly. After she had been calmed by
Matron Tierney she admitted that her
brother's hair was not- auburn. An~
other of her brothers was .. thereupon
summoned to the Coroner's office by
Detective Taylor, and he unheslta^
tingly declared the body to be thiit of
a stranger. He said also that he had
seen his brother on the preceding
evening alive and well.

Treasurer of Kings County Is Dead.
HANFORD, Nov. 3. âCounty Treas
urer W. H. Slavin died here to-day,
aged 55 years. He was a native of
Missouri. Death was due to tuber
culosis. Slavin came here in 1878 and
when Kings County was organized in
1893 he was elected Treasurer by the
Democrats and held office ever since.
He leaves one daughter.
MRS. BERTHA CONNESS
THE DEAD MAN'S FRIEND
arrested for distributing campaign lit
erature, at an outdoor political meeting
on Ninth street. Patrolman P. C.
Blick said that the Salvation Army had
been officially restrained from circulat
ing tracts at their open air meetings,
but the Judge opined that conviction of
the defendant would be equivalent to
prevention of free speech, as the cir
culars he Â¦ distributed were intended to
prove some of the arguments uttered
by the suellbinderB. â¢.
The circulars in question contained
a comparative review of the respective
Congressional records of Julius Kalm
and E. J. Livernash, and were appar
ently issued with the. object of helping
the latter candidate's chances of find
ing favor with the labor voters. x
Mrs. N. Christianson, en route from
Stockton to Portland, was accompanied
by a heavy satchel, and after leaving
the river boat she engaged Louis Me
rino to carry her impedimenta to the
Portland steamer. Louis, whose au
dacity was innumerable degrees ahead
of his discretion, attempted' to run
away with his burden, and the handi
cap was so heavy that to overtake and
arrest him required hardly any speed
effort on the part of the corpulent po
liceman whom Mrs. Christianson sum
moned to her aid. Six months was the
sentence pronounced by Judge Cab
aniss. â¢ â¢ . .
WiJHa:.i Walsh.an able-bodied men
dicant, was given thirty days by Judge
Fritz after the policeman had told of
how the defendant made a specialty of
accosting women and cursing them If
they refused to contribute. ;
"And If you ever come before me
again," said his Honor to William,
"I'll give you six months."
William Felloes and John Sells were
accompanied by two young women as
they walked down Fourth street at 8:30
o'clock Wednesday -evening and the
young woman with Mr. Felloes scream
ed when John Collins suddenly sprang
from : a doorway and, aiming a knife
thrust at her Â¦ escort, shouted : "How
dare you walk with that girl?" Mr.
Felloes threw up his right arm to pro
tect his body and the knife almost
severed the thumb from his hand. Ere
the thrust could be repeated Mr. Col
lins was in custody and the charges
against him on Judge Mogan's calendar
are assault with a deadly weapon and
carrying a* concealed weapon.
When the case was called the prose
cution obtained a continuance till to
day because of Mr. Felloes' Inability
"to appear, his wounded hand b.eing un
der treatment at a hospital.
The - defendant, about fifty years of
age and fashionably attired, stated
that he is a horseman from San Jose,
but would say nothing concerning his
attack. upon Felloes. When arrested
the open knife was found in his poc
ket and when reminded of that fact he
merely said: "Never mind; when the
proper time comes I'll tell my story."
John Sullivan, Patrick Foley and
Frank Ryan were alleged to operate as
a street-begging triumvirate. â¢ "While
one of them solicited alms the other
two stood - in front of the person ac
costed and by their menacing demeanor
endeavored to intimidate him into com
plying with [ their comrade's request.
That's the game they, were engaged in
at midnight on Kearny street when two
patrolmen unexpectedly turned a cor
ner and caught them in the act.
"In these days of business combina
tions It is not surprising to find the
system extend to mendicancy," said
Judpe Mogan, "but street-begging that
is just one remove from footpadry
must be suppressed. I will sentence
you gentlemen to-morrow and as
sure you now that you will not have
opportunity to repeat your emulation
of 'The Three Guardsmen'â 'one for all
a:.d all for one,' you â¢ knowâ until the
winter is far advanced."
Nineteen-year-old Harry Burns' saw
an advertising banner suspended from
the side of a peddler's wagon on
Church street and when the peddler's
back was turned Harry slyly applied
alighted match to the muslin and glee
fully watched the resultant -blaze. The
peddler had Harry arrested for dis
turbing the . peace, because the de
stroyed banner had advertised a forth
coming picnic of the Peddlers' Union,
and in Judge Cabaniss' court the spe
cial counsel of that organization ap
peared to push I the . ' prosecution of
Harry, but relented and suggested that
the lad be dismissed with a, reprimand.
Reprimand administered and dismissal,

Miss Alice Haggerty Inadvertently
left her watch upon the parlor mantel
piece of the apartment-house in which
she lives at 742 O'Farrell street, and
when she missed the timepiece
went in quest of it she found Perry
Olcutt, 25 years of age, Just emerging
from the parlor and the watch con
spicuously absent from where she had
placed it. She taxed him with its
theft, and when arrested he confessed
that her suspicion was solidly founda
tioned. With feminine perversity,
however, she showed reluctance.' to
have him punished for grand larceny,
a penitentiary offense, and through her
mediation the complaint was reduced
to petty larceny and Judge Cabaniss
pronounced a sentence of twenty days.
Olcutt says he is a miner and called to
visit a friend, when he saw the watch
and could not overcome the temptation
to steal it
After vainly endeavoring to ascertain
the cause of the feud between the Roses
and the Ballingers' the Judge continued
the hearing, and advised the Roses, as
they are a more recent acquisition to
Decatur street society than the Bal
lingers, to remove their home to some
other neighborhood. ."For," quoth his
Honor, "the convenience of the oldest
Inhabitant is entitled to prior consid
eration in a contention which evidently
can only be settled by the removal of
one of the contestants."
Testimony In the battery case of Wil
liam H. Balllnger, wool sprter, of 11 De
catur stret, versus Hugh Rose, team
ster, of 9 Decatur street, . disclosed the
fact that there were four rattling prelim
inaries to the event In which Mr. Rose
blackened Mr. Ballinger's right eye and
shifted the location of a few of his left
ribs. The milling occurred last Sunday
afternoon contiguous to the respective
homes of the contestants and ' in the
following order:
2:15 o'clockâ Mrs. Ballinger versus
Mrs. Rose; draw.
2:30 o'clockâ Mr. Ballinger versus
Mrs. O'Brien of 8 Decatur street, a
"lady friend" of Mrs. Rose; Mrs.
O'Brien won.
2:45 o'clock â Mr. and Mrs. Rose ver
sus Mrs. O'Brien, who had suddenly
transferred her allegiance; Mrs. O'Brien
won.
2:50 o'clockâ Mr. Rose versus Mrs.
O'Brien; Mrs. O'Brien won.
3:10 o'clockâ Mr. Rose versus Mr. Bal
linger; Mr.. Rose lost. .
Casualties â Mrs. Rose, one black eye,
administered by Mr. Ballinger; Mrs.
Ballinger, internal injuries of indeter
minate seriousness, administered by
Mrs. Rose: Mr. Ballinger, one eye put
out of commission and ribB dislocated,
by Mr. Rose; Mr. Rose, knuckles of
right hand bruised by colliding with
cheekbone of Mr. Ballinger. Mrs.
O'Brien escaped physical injury.
When the parties lined up before Po
lice Judge Mogan yesterday Mr. Bal
linger's head was bandaged and a pro
tuberance on the left side of his vest
was alleged to indicate where his ribs
were out of proper position. Mrs. Rose's
discolored and swollen left eye was
plainly visible through a dark veil. She
averred that Mrs. Ballinger attacked
her with a pair of scissors, which she
captured in the struggle and submitted
in evidence. Mrs. Ballinger retaliated
by declaring that Mrs. Rose brandished
a razor. Mr. 'Rose did not attempt to
deny that he battered Mr. Ballinger,
and silently pointed to Mrs. R.'s dam
aged optic as the provocation for the

MR. JUSTICE
FINNEMORE
Judge of the Natal Supreme
Court, Sends the Following
Remarkable Testimonial
TO CUTICURA
The World Is Cuticura's Field,
Used Wherever Civilization
Has Penetrated.
" I desire to give mj Yolnntary testi-
mony to the beneficial effect* of your
Cntlcora Remedies. I hare Buffered
for some time from an excess of uric
acid In the blood ; and since the middle
of last year, from a severe attack of
Eczema, chiefly on the. scalp, face, ears
and neck and on one limb. I was for
sereral months under professional
treatments, but thcremedies prescribed
were of no avail, and I was gradaally
becoming worse, my face n was dread-
fully disfigured and I lost nearly, all ray
hair. At last, my wife prevailed upon
me to try the Cuticnra Remedies â¢ and 1 1
gave them a thorough trial with the
most satisfactory results. The disease
â¢oon began to disappear < and Â¦ my; hair
commenced to' grow again. A fresh
growth of hair Is covering my I head,
and ; my limb (although â¢ not yet quite
cared) is gradually improving. My wife
thinks so highly of your remedies that
she has been purchasing them in order;
to make presents to other persons suf-
fering from similar complaints, v" and,
ag President of the Bible : Women's
Society, has told the Bible women to
report if any case should come under:
their notice when a poor; person - Is ' so
afflicted," so that your remedies 'may be
resortea to." ' - ' â¢_.
