CHICAGO, Oct. 16.â Senatorial cour
tesy Is likely to be tossed to the dogs
when United States Senator Bacon of
Georgia and United States Senator A.
J. Hopkins of Illinois meet.
The Georgian has designated his
Northern colleague as a "lightweight â
the lightest man in the Senate." He
charges that the Illlnoisan has been
s& lacking in courtesy as to accuse
him (Senator Bacon) of being no bet
ter than a murderer.
To all of which Hopkins says "ab
surd."
Bacon is stumping the country for
thÂ« Democratic National Committee
and in Elgin a day or two ago, where
Senator Hopkins had preceded him at
a Republican rally, he was Informed
the latter had warned the people
against him, charging he had been one
of six men to draw lots to see which
should shoot a white Republican, who
subsequently got his quietus.
Although the official account of the battle does not present the dis
astrous picture that many in St. Petersburg has resigned themselves to
see. the general feeling here is of the deepest gloom. If the battle has not
been Russia's Sedan, in fact, the moial and political effects could hardly
be worse. The result will render the war and its conduct more unpopular
than ever at home, while the greatest fears are expressed that the Chin
ese population, if not the Government, will be encouraged to abandon a
long doubtful neutrality and openly side in with the victorious Japanese.
From the military point of view the most bitter disappointment is in the
knowledge that the reverse seals the fate of the. heroic _ defenders of Port
Arthur, who are now without hope of succor from the outside world.
A remarkable feature throughout is the popular sympathy with General
Kuropatkin. Viceroy Al=xieff is again charged with responsibility for
Kuropatkin's attempt to take the aggressive. Pity rather than criticism
is awarded the ill starred general; but it Is felt among army officers that
the military prestige of the whole of: Russia has so suffered at his hands
that it is impossible that he can ever be given the chance to retrieve the
fllffitirtt 1 '
Thursday witnessed another furious cannonade, in which the whole of
the Russian center was forced back. In the afternoon of the same day
the Russian right, began to give way. Toward evening came a few hours*
lull, but at midnight the cannonading was renewed with increased fury,
eye witnesses declaring that it exceeded in Intensity that at Liaoyang
during the famous fighting of August 30 and August 31.
There was much desperate fighting on Friday, which was carried on
through a tremendous storm of rain, hail and thunder. General Kuropat
kin personally took command of the Petroff regiment. It was in the
midst of this awful war of man and the elements that the Russians, the Pet
roff regiment leading, for the last time charged doggedly into Shakhe and
took the town in the face of. the hottest Japanese bombardment.
The latest reports rrom the battle came on Sunday afternoon and even
ing, when the Russians were carrying on a heavy rear guard fight, evi
dently retiring on Mukden. Generals Oku and Nodzu were concentrating
for another blow on the Russian right, where the fighting is described as
having been furious. General Nodzu is reported to have been wounded
seriously, but this cannot be confirmed.
Mukden itself remains cuiet, though the sounds of battle are plainly
heard to the southward. The railway station is congested with trains of
wounded proceeding to Harbin. Tlu* hospital facilities are completely
overtaxed. Six thousand wounded arrived at Mukden on Saturday alone.
The heroic surgeons and nurses, many of whom have been without sleep
for thirty-six hours, are ready to drop from fatigue.
MEANS THE DOWNFALL OF KUR0PATIQN.
General Kuropatkin says that Friday night was passed in comparative
quiet, but that Saturday saw an immense cencentration of Japanese on the
Great Mandarin road, where the Russian batteries were vigorously playing
in an effort to hold them in check. The result of Saturday's fight has not
been officially given, but there is every evidence that it was one of the
most severe character.
It was during the Japanese furious night attack on "Wednesday, ac
cording to unofficial accounts, that the Russians lost their guns.
RUSSIAN CENTER AND RIGHT FORCED BACK.
Another serious fact that remains undetermined is the ammunition sup
ply. Seven days of furious fighting must have greatly depleted the supply
of both armies. Official circles express great confidence that General Kuro
patkin is the better off in this respect, but at last accounts the Japanese
were bombarding as if they were confident of an inexhaustible supply.
The official story of the battle says that the Japanese made a deter
mined effort to break the Russian center on Friday night, but this, it seems,
may be a clerical or telegraphic error for Thursday. Simultaneously the
Japanese launched a heavy assault against the village of Shakhe, which
had already been the scene of so many furious attacks and counter attacks.
The Russians were forced to evacuate the village, but heroically recaptured
the position. This brought reserves of both sides into action, but whether
the v.hole of the reserves of either side were engaged is not clear." In any
event the Russians were again and finally driven out, making five times
that Shakhe had changed hands in the course of the battle. The Russians
then retired to a new position north of Shakhe.
Of the left flank, which was one of the most important points in the
line, absolutely nothing ie heard, which leaves the inference that it is not
in a position to communicate with the remainder of the army.
All the wounded are being carried to Harbin, farther north.
It is understood that the correspondents also have been ordered to Har
bin, which indicates that the retreat will not even stop at Tie Pass. All
hopes of the world-heralded advance to Port Arthur have been abandoned.
The weather conditions are even worse than during the retreat from
Liaoyang. Streams are bank-high and fords are impassable, but it is im
possible to say how this will affect the final situation. It may prove Rus
sia's salvation by preventing a Japanese pursuit. On the other hand, how
ever, if the Russians are on the wrong side, the flooded rivers may only
emphasize the completeness of the disaster.
AMMUNITION SUPPLY MAY BE DEPLETED.
General Kuropatkin's story leaves the Russians still tenaciously holding
the north bank of the Shakhe River, but the general belief is that this is
only the finale of one of the greatest military dramas of history and the
Russian army as a whole is retiring toward Mukden, having suffered at the
most conservative estimate a loss of more than 30,000.
ST. PETERSBURG. Oct. IT. 3:45 a. m.â The official veil was lifted to
day from the ghastly tragedy around Shakhe, but even the official account,
supplemented by numerous press dispatches. leaves much uncertainty. as, to
the situation. Oat of the fragmentary mass of Information at" 'hand'itr*'isr

tween the two belligerents Is a deli
cate one, but what a splendid tri
umph for diplomacy it would be if
peace could b2 arranged. It seems to
me that the question of honor Is no
longer involved. If Russia feels that
such a question is involved, surely the
heroic and successful defense of Port
Arthur and the valor shown by Rus
sia's sons on the fields of Manchuria
should forever determine the quality
of Russian courage. Russia should
remember that the distance dividing
her strength and the limitations of
her railway are historical factors in
this war. These factors are generally
known. They are appreciated by
everybody and are not looked upon as
faults."
The preliminary reports indicate
that about 60,000 men of both sides
have been either killed or wounded
(the larger number of them being
Russians) since the armies of the two
belligerents closed in combat.
Even the Japanese, to whom the
great victory is of paramount im
portance, seem to be shocked by the
slaughter of their enemies. The Jap
anese people are receiving the news
from the field of battle calmly, and
there can be heard no shouts in the
streets proclaiming the victory of their
nation. Few flags are displayed. Prob
ably later on there will be a proces
sion with the consequent jollification,
but there are *"Â»Â«ird many expressions
of opinion that no demonstration of
any kind should be held. A promi
nent Japanese said to-day:
"We have won a sweeping and a
decisive victory, which may prove to
be the salvation of our country's ex
istence; but we regret both our own
losses and the terrible slaughter which
our forces have inflicted on the enemy.
We regret still more the necessity
which forced us to engage in this
war."
A member of the diplomatic corps
said:
TOKIO, Oct. 16. 6 p. m. â There is

be largely increased before the final

MUKDEN, Oct. 16. 4 p. m. â The

enormous force, have a great ad
vantage in knowing the topography of
the country. They evince desperate
courage. They have suffered terrible
losses, but bear them with perfect
equanimity. Their energy seems un

ROME, Oct. 16. â News has reached
relatives of Don Jaime, son of Don
Carlos, the pretender to the Spanish
throne, that he has been injured by a
fall from his horse at Russian head
quarters in Manchuria. The last word
received from Don Jaime was a pen
ciled note to his sister. Princess Be

inferred that since that note was writ
ten Don Jaime had returned to head

Don Jaime Injured by a Fall.
"The night of October 14 passed
quietly. Before 9 o'clock this morn
ing a rather marked movement of the
enemy was noticed in the direction
of our positions on the great Man
darin road. Our batteries opened fire
on them. I have received a report
from the commander of the left wing
that the enemy has been strongly re
inforced there.
"As was the case at Liaoyang. the
heavy firing caused a storm to burst
forth*, followed by a torrential rain.
The roads are in very bad condition
and the level of the rivers has risen.
"The general order for all troops
remains the same as before, to offer
most resolute resistance. I have just
received a report that a considerable
Japanese force has crossed the rail
way line from west to east."
KUROKI REINFORCED.
"On our right wini" the position was
for some time very alarming. The
troops were attacked from the front
and by a turning movement on their
right flank. The chief of a detach
ment advanced the troops set apart
for a last rally, they having attacked
the Japanese from the flank in their
turn. Several villages were retaken
by us. The right wing maintained its
positions on the line of the Shakhe po
sitions. The troops on our center
were noticeably advanced in com
parison, with other troops in the gen
eral position of the line. One position
on our right flank had been chosen
beforehand and partially fortified.
"Our troops have been fighting for
four days and many regiments have
not slept for three nights. Neverthe
less, I have full confidence In their
capacity to continue the struggle. The
Japanese losses must be very consid
erable.
"Reinforced by reserves, the Jap
anese dislodged us again from the vil
lage of Shakhe. Then the advanced
reserves and troops defending the po
sition resumed the offensive and after
a stubborn fight we succeeded in re
occupying Shakhe. repulsing the Jap
anese and driving them back two kilo
meters from that place.
RIGHT WING IN' PERIL.
ST. PETERSBURG, Oct. 16. â Un
der date of October 15. General Kuro
patkin sent the following telegram to
the Emperor:
"On the night of October 14 large
forces of Japanese attacked the corps
drawn up jn line at Shakhe, on the
great Mandarin road. Several attacks
were repulsed, but the last succeeded
and the corps was broken. At that
moment fighting was begun on the
right flank with a neighboring sec
tion. The possibility was that, with
the rupture of our center, our whole
formation would be threatened and
that the neighboring troops might
force a retreat. In order to support
the troops on the great Mandarin
road several battalions were rapidly
pushed forward. The troops were
thus enabled to take the offensive and
succeeded in retaking the village of
Shakhe, reoccupying the first posi
tions.
"The prisoners declared that the war
would continue a long time, because
the Russians had decided to attain a
final victory, regardless of the losses
which might be involved, as otherwise
a defeat would mean a general revolu
tion and the disintegration of Russian
territory.
"During one engagement the Thir
ty-seven division, especially the First
Brigade, sustained extraordinary losses.
The first company of One Hundred and
Forty-fifth Regiment was annihilated
on Sankualhsi Mountain and many
line officers were killed, wounded or
captured. The Third Siberian reserve
division sustained the greatest loss.
"At the beginning of the war the
Russian regiments numbered 4000
men each. After the battle of Liao
yang each of the regiments was re
duced to a strength of about 2500,
with the exception of the Twelfth
Regiment, which, as a result of this
battle, was reduced to 800. This regi
ment, after the battle, was command
ed by a captain, the battalions being
in command of sub-lieutenants, while
the older privates directed the opera
tions of its companies."
"General Linevitch, commanding the
field fighting force in the Ossouri dis
trict, was taking p. devious road from
the east and', advancing -toward â¢ the
southeast of Liaoyang, for the purpose
o? threatening the line of a possible
Japanese retreat. General Mistchenke,
commanding six regiments of dra
goons, operated on Linevitch's right.
"The center column was disposed as
follows: The First Corps on the right,
the Fourth Corps on the left and the
Fifth Corps in rear of the center. The
Fourth Corps consisted of the First
and Fourth Siberian reserve division.
Four batteries of quick-firing guns
were attached to each division.
"Acting under this command General
Kuropatkin advanced with his whole
strength to the south of Mukden, divid
ing his forces into three columnsâ the
center, the right and the left.
"The center column, composed of the
First, Fourth and Fifth corps, under
the command of General Soloieff, ad
vanced toward Tungshankou and Lln
hua Mountain. The left column, which
was composed of two corps under Gen
eral Stakelberg, advanced against the
Japanese right. The right column,
which was composed of three corps, ad
vanced against the Japanese left. Be
sides these thore was one corps held in
reserve, which was following the cen
ter column.
TOKIO, Oct. 16.â According to state
ments made by Russian prisoners. Gen
eral Kuropatkin was ordered by Em
peror Nicholas to make a stand at Muk
den and to assume the aggressive as
speedily as possible In order to relieve
the Port Arthur garrison. This order,
the prisoners say, reached Mukden on
September 27, and General Kuropatkin
in obedience to it began his disastrous
southern advance movement. An ex
tended report dealing with the state
ments of these prisoners follows:
"According to statements made to of-
I>risoners , the enemy had received in
flcers of the center army by Russian
formation that the strength of the gar
rison at Port Arthur was being dally
reduced and that the garrison was in a
disastrous condition. Fresh Russian re
inforcements were .constantly arriving
in Manchuria from Europe, and the
strength of the forces under Genera;
Kuropatkin in the neighborhood of
Mukden had reached more than nine
army corps. Thereupon, the prisoners
said, the Russian Emperor on Septem
ber 27 ordered Kuronatkin not to retire
a step beyond Mukden, and directed
him, circumstances permitting, to as
sume the offensive as quickly as possi
ble and to drive the Japanese out of
Southern Manchuria in order to rescue
the Port Arthur garrison.

CZAR BLAMED FOR ROUT.
Army Fighting Dog
gedly to Prevent
Annihilation.
The fighting recommenced at daylight
to-day. The thunder of guns is dis
tinctly heard in Mukden. The whota
Russian army is slowly retiring: antl
fighting every Inch of the way. When
the writer came north to-day then*
appeared no danger of any part of
the Russian army being cut off.
In an informal talk which the writer
had with General Kuropatkin in th â¢
held just before the battle commenced,
he spoke in glowing terms of the brav
ery of the Japanese, saying that they
were a gallant fop. and also that the\
were most correct in the observance n?
the rules of war. In this respect. hÂ»
said, it was the most pleasant war h<^
had ever been engaged in.
Another thunderstorm broke shortly
after noon, flooding the streams and
turning the roads into seas and by
evening the main Russian force had
withdrawn across the Shakhe River.
Japanese shells were dropping within
a short distance of the river on th>
left.
The morning of the 13th found the
Russians with their backs to the
Shakhe River, across which the trans
port had been withdrawn during the
night. Fighting continued from these
positions all during the day of the 14th.
while the Russian reinforcements took
up positions on the hills to the north
of the river.
The thunder and rain continued
through the morning of the 13th.
Notwithstanding this, the guns opened
fire promptly at daylight. The Rus
sians fought stubbornly, but retired
slowly. The Japanese continued to
threaten the Russian left. Toward
evening the Japanese opened with all
their guns on the Russian positions,
the shells dropping like hail in the
field and on the hills.
Additional guns were sent forward
to protect the left, while the batteries
withdrew across the plains to the hills
on the north side. This gave the Jap
anese possession of a high hill on the
south side, from which they shelled
the valley through which the Rus
sians had advanced during the even
ing. The Japanese apparently suf
fered greatlv from the Russian fire.
The morning of the 12th found lit
tle change in the positions of the two
armies, except that the Japanese had
worked further around to the left.
Probably the greatest artillery fight of
the battle took place on October 12.
Batteries were placed on every avail
able hill and at the same time regi
ment after regiment of infantry was
poured Into the plain by both sides,
only to be thrown back shattered and
torn.
It is impossible as yet to estimate
the loss of life.
During the night a heavy rainstorm,
occurred, in the midst of which the
artillery continued to boom, and at
one point the Japanese infantry
charged. It was met by Russian in
fantrymen in the darkness, which was
lightened only by the flashes of the
guns, the bursting of sheila and tho
streaks of lightning. The men fought
hand to hand, the Japanese regiment
finally being driven back.
RUSSIAN'S RETIRE SLOWLY.

tung a few Japanese prisoners were
taken. _
The Russians followed the Japanese
across the valley, taking positions in
the foothills, from which the artillery
shelled the Japanese force, while the
infantry advanced through the denies.
On October 10 the artillery duel con
tinued, the Russians advancing slowly.
During the night the Japanese changed
their positions and at daylight en
filaded the Russian trenches, pouring a
terrific shrapnel fire on the infantry,
composed of one regiment, tmly a rem
nant of which was left.
From this on the Japanese took the
offensive the entire day of the 11th,
throwing shrapnel and Shlmose powder
shells among the infantry and artillery.
The Russians held tenaciously to their
positions.
KUICOKTS FLAXKIXG MOVEMENT.
Early in the day the Japanese cum
menced to work around the Russian
left and succeeded in dropping a few
shells on the road and in the villages
where the transport and reserves were
gathered. The Japanese had the range
of the road and village perfectly. They
compelled the men and wagons to take
to the fields. This shelling did little
damage, beyond disconcerting the men
and horses.
"The main force of the right army,
â¢v.nich had already occupied Chouchia
fun Heights, reached a point on the
Fh&khe River, but one division of the
enemy continues to oJTer a stubborn

Reports of the great battle continue

army alone buried 2000, making the
totai number of Russians buried by the
Japanese, with Xodzu's army still to

calculation and making reasonable al
lowance for the fighting of the 14th and

TOKJO. Oct. 16.â Field Marshal Oya
jna estimates the Russian dead left on
the field, including the fighting of the

A telegram received from the Man

ports that the fighting- has ceased on

HEADQUARTERS OF THE RUS
SIAN WESTERN ARMY. Friday. Oct.
14. â The week's fighting in its bloody
results has exceeded that at the bat
tle of Liaoyang.
There was a tremendous Russian
artillery fire to-day on positions which
the Japanese took on October 13. An
attempt was made to hold Shakapo
and for a few hours there was a blis
tering fire equal in its fury to that
in the battle of the 12th at Tousanpu.
The infantry, which ,for two days
has only been supplementing from
the trenches the work of the artillery,
is now scattered all the way to Muk
den and is frequently seen marooned
in the flooded fields.
RUSSIAN LINES BROKEN*.
One newly arrived Russian corps
gave a good account of itself. The
Japanese successfully enfiladed three
places where the Russians had made
a heroic, but fruitless, stand all dur
ing: the past week.
On account of the prowess of the
Japanese in the mountains the chief
interest will now center there, unless
the Japanese should persist in their ef
forts to insert a wedge in the center
of the Russian lines-
The Russians' achievements along
the railway yesterday were not suffi
cient to enable them to maintain their
position along the line where yester
day'* fight began ana the Russian
forces are now in the plain ten miles
north of the point where they attacked
the Japanese on October 9. They are
fighting hard and stubbornly, but are
in retreat.
MUKDEN, Saturday. Oct. 15.âDesul
tory cannonading is heard, but there
is not likely to be any important
lighting to-day, as both armies are
stuck in the mud.
Howitzers are used by the Eastern
army. The Russian gu:;s have supe
rior range and burst shrapnel at ttOOO
yards.
There is a' scarcity of reliable maps-
Two divisional commanders have lost
their chief staff officers, one of them
being killed and many commanding
officers met death heroically leading
their regiments.
Shrapnel fell near General Kuropat
kin. He showed desperate energy, and
even in the darkest nour remained
hopeful.
The Japanese must feel the strain.
There was a cessation of hostilities on
Saturday. Neither side can stand many
such contests, the ferocity of which
was frightful.
The Russians are now fighting as a
matter of pride. Manchuria is forgot
ten. They feel that they cannot stop;
that they must win one battle.
This evening the Japanese seem no
nearer. Fires are burning to the south.
About twelve miles from here the east
ern army is retiring without fighting.
RAIN CAUSES BRIEF CESSATION.
There has been great sacrifice of of

of Ills Field Guns.
LONDON, Oct. 17.â All reports this
morning agree upon General Kuropat
kin's defeat in what military critics
consider one of the greatest battles of
modern times, comparable with Ko-nlg
gratz and Leipsic. Spencer Wilkinson
tonsiders Marquis Oyama's conduct of
the battle as not marked by the same
distinctness of plan and execution as
that of General Kuropatkin, whose
handling of his army is quite intel
ligible on the assumption that he was
ordered to make the attack.
Belated dispatches arriving in Lon
don, descriptive of the week's fighting,
to some extent bear out. this view. For
instance, the Standard's correspondent
with General Kuroki's army testifies
that the Russian troops were more
skillfully led and more capable and
resolute than those encountered in the
opening weeks of the campaign. The
same correspondent remarks the grave
disadvantage under which the Japan
ese are laboring, owing to the inferior
ity of their field guns. He refers to
the fighting of October 11, "when our
six batteries, though well posted and
admirably handled, were compelled to
remain silent the greater part of the
day and see the chance of a Hfetime
pass by under the very muzzles of
their guns. Effective pursuit was de
barred us by the superior range of the
Russian artillery."
I'la^ctl at Disadvantage by Inferiority
At midnight a violent cannonading
began and increased until it attained
the intensity that marked the artillery
duel at Liaoyang on August 30 and Au
gust 31. This cannonading continued
throughout October 14, not ceasing for
a moment, not even for the usual mid
day meal. Under the cover of the ar
tillery fire the Japanese infantry cour
ageously assumed the offensive against
the Russian intrenched positions, but
their courage was unavailing.
Toward evening the Russians actu
ally moved forward. General Kuropat
kin personally directing the operations
on the center-right flank, where ' the
fighting was the hottest Taking com
mand of the Petroff Regiment, he or
dered it forward. Animated by the
courage of their idolized commander,
the troops rushed forward with a shout,
driving the Japanese from the heights.
Standing there, Kuropatkin could see
through his field-glasses a srrouo of
Japanese officers on the opposite
heights at a distance of three miles
and in their midst a hoisted battle
flag. These were probably General
Oku and his staff watching the prog
ress of the battle.
Â«
OYAMA IS HANDICAPPED.
At 8 o'clock in the evening the fight
ing ceased along the whole front. From
the Russian line signal fires were no
ticed along the Japanese line, where
the Japanese were probably relocating
guns and troops for the next day's
attack.
The whole day a cannonade raged fu
riously, under cover of which the JaD
anese made several bayonet attacks,
but were repulsed. During one of these
attacks the Japanese killed all the gun
ners of one battery, and the Runs were
left in the trenches. An attempt to re
take these guns by the Uknobsky and
Eplfanievsky regiments was only Dar
tially successful.
Toward morning the Japanese ceased
their efforts on the Russian right, and
until 3 o'clock in the afternoon concen
trated their efforts on the Russian cen
ter. At 3 o'clock they renewed their
attack on the right and overwhelmed
it with numbers, forcing it back several
miles.

Thomas J. McCoy is at present under
$20,000 bond on a charge of embezzle
ment- The Grand Jury returned twen
ty-two Indictments against him indi
vidually, two jointly with his father
and two jointly against him and John
White, assistant cashier.
The loss cannot be correctly esti
mated, but the residence alone is
known to have cost more than $25,000.
It was elaborately furnished. There is
much excitement in the city.
The McCoy Bank failed last April,
and the liabilities greatly exceeded- the
assets. Many families lost heavily, as
the bank was one of the best known
and oldest established in this part of
the State.
The McCoy family was not at home
at the time and it is believed that none
of them is in the city.
The wreck of the home i3 complete.
The walls were blown outward, preci
pitating the roof into the basement.
Fragments of the residence and pieces
of furniture were found hundreds of
feet away.
The house was a frame structure,
valued at 523,000, and considered one
of the most beautiful homes in North
ern Indiana.' When the explosion oc
curred the house was unoccupied. Mc-
Coy is believed to be visiting friends
in Chicago. The detonation was heard
for miles. Instantly hundreds of peo
ple flocked to the scene.

INDIANAPOLIS, Ind.. Oct. 16. â A
telephone message from Rensselaer re
pcrts that the residence of Thomas J.
McCoy, president of the defunct Mc-
Coy Bank, against whom indictments
were recently returned for alleged
complicity in the wrecking of the
bank, has been dynamited and totally
destroyed.
According to the Chinese papers for
the last four days, in another year the
queue or '"pis tail" will be a buried
relic, or perhaps a curio in museums.
Chattering groups of Celestials stand
on the corners in Chinatown and dis
cuss the possibility of the enforcement
of a new imperial mandate which will
compel them to doff the braided and
glossy string of hair that wanders
frcm their occipital process downward
past their girths and embellishes the
rear part of their makeup.
The local Chinese papers have it that
the new order is being considered seri
ously bv the head of the Chinese Gov
ernment and that before long queues
will not be worn. It is but a few years
since the Japanese were adorned with
queues, and the doflingr of them was
considered a mark of advancing civil
ization. The Emperor lias decided that
his subjects would look more civilized
without the '"pig tail."
Great excitement is on in the Chinese
quarter, and much protest is already
being voiced against the proposed
order. Another question that is causing
much talk is the ultimate disposal of
the 20,000 castoffi dermal appendages
when the order becomes a law. They
might be buried or made into hair mat
tresses. The latter course seems im
probable on account of the harshness
of the Chinese hair.
The Chinese papers say that Inside
of six months the Queue will be but a
memory, and the years of careful
growth and treasure will have gone to
naught. The Chinese barber will in
clude hair cutting in his price list, and
reap a harvest from the owners -of di
vested "pig tails," and the queue, for
centuries the distinguishing mark of
thÂ« Oriental race, will be sold over the
counter in curiosity shops and guarded
in museums, ilanv years hence when
scientists are excavating that portion
of land on which Chinatown now rests
they may unearth questionable pieces
of hairy rope, and treasure them, as
mementoes of a long extinct race.

Extreme Party Brings About a Dan

EFFORT MADE TO INCITE
ITALIANS TO REBELLION
The Congo Reform Association,
which Includes eleven lards, four
Bishops and many other of the most
notable folk in Great Britain, takes
no stock in the committee appointed
by Kins Leopold of Belgium to In
vestigate the great mass of charges
like those made above. In a letter to
Lord Lansdowne, aa Foreign Secre
tary, sent this week, they 1 presf nt a
formidable list of reasons indicating
that Kins Leooold's committee is a
fake, appointed solely for whitewash
ing' purposes. What the Consa asso
ciation is working for is an Impartial
international investigation.
This same missionary states that in
the course of one of his journeys he
saw thirty young men and boys tied
together Â¦with ropes fastened round
their necks being marched off to a
Belgian station as recruits for the
army of native soldiers. Yet accord
ing to the Congo Free State reports
the system of enlistment is entirely
voluntary.
At the village from which the mis
sionary sends his account he says that
a Belgian ofilcial declared he would
order the score of soldiers who ac
companied him to fire indiscriminately
into the houses of any of the men who
attempted to hide from him.
Embracing the Christian faith af
fords them no protection from th#ir
white tyrants.
Women, equally with men, are sub
jected to imprisonment and cruel
treatment for failing to bring in rub
ber.
A missionary who having lived for
eighteen months in the vicinity of a
Belgian fort has enjoyed exceptional
opportunities of observing the methods
of the Free State Government sends
these samples of outrages and oppres
sion. Of some of them he was an eye
witness, and what he did not see he
verified by personal investigation.
An officer of the Congo Free State,
accompanied by some native soldiers,
entered the district to collect carriers,
and apparently for no other reason,
than sheer love of human butchery
put sbc persons to death.
On the return journey a hunter was
encountered who had committed the
heinous offense of killing some wild
animals and orders were given, to bind
hia hand3 and legs and then hang him.
To expedite his death the white man
fired a shot into him, and after the
soldiers had inflicted unspeakable mu
tilations on the corpse it was left to
be devoured by hyenas.
A native chief was once ordered to
line up his wives, that the soldiers
might make selections from among
them.
ROPES AROUND NECKS.
EYE WITNESS TALKS.
"A little child had its brains dashed
out and was cut in half. The upper
portions of the body was impaled on
one stake, the legs and abdomen on an
other. The brutal 'soldiery then feasted
on -the killed.
"A large number of people were sub
sequently killed, cut up and a quantity
of the flesh eaten on the spot. The re
mainder of the 'meat' was taken to
town.
"The terrified natives were, however,
afraid to appear with their rubber after
this raid, and so a third attack result
ed, headed this time by the rubber
agent himself, who was accompanied
by 'sentries* and cannibal Â¦warriors."
In a charge of a sentry, a body of
men in the employ of the Abir who had
granted the concession wa3 dispatched
to enlighten the people of Bolima on ths
subject of rubber.

KILL. ELEVEN" NATIVES.
LONDON, Oct. 16. â Advance proofs
of letters reporting the atrocities in the
Congo region reach me just at the time
the honorary secretary of that distin
guished body known as the Congo Re
form Association is* preparing to set out
for the United States to ask President
Roosevelt to take a hand in stopping
the horrors connected with the Congo
rubber industry, managed by King Leo
pold & Co. Included in these reports of
responsible witnesses are accounts of
oppressions, tortures, maimings and
murders that would be well nigh in
cridibla If they had not been preceded
by so many similar instances well au
thenticated.
It should be understood that the poor
natives of Bollma had done absolutely
nothing to provoke an attack. It wa3
simply their misfortune to live in a re
gion where rubber trees abounded.
They had no particular use for rubber
themselves, and, after the fashion of
benighted heathen, saw no good reason
why they should make slaves of them
selves to gather it for others. But the
white aliens of the Congo Free State
coveted rubber, because they could
convert rubber Into money. To get it
on the cheapest possible terms it be
came necessary to convince the simple
Bolima folk that if they did not make
slaves of themselves to gather it â¢worse
things might befall them.

whole, I could not find that the fall

enough to affect the general results.
'The proportion of young men, or
new voters, who are supporting Roose

But, where organization has been ef

you know that that statement is false ;
and that ail of the Republicans from

ception d Metcaif, who, I think, was ;
absent and not in his seat when the

Beil replied: "'Yes, that is true."
Whereupon McLachlan said: "Bell,
you know that is sailing under false
colors, and why have you net corrected
such statements?"
. Upon which Beil changed color and
made no reply.
Further JdcLachian said to Bell:
"You and your friends are claiming
that you secured the appropriations for
the Sacramento and Napa rivers. Now,
you know that is incorrect. You know
that neither you nor any other Con
gressman from California secured any
appropriations for such purposes."
Bell replied that he did secure such
appropriations.
Whereupon McLachlan stated: "You
know that I was a member of that
committee, and that the only appro
l nation recommended by that commit- '
ttrir and passed by Congress was a gen
tral appropriation of 53,000,000, to be
expended under direction of the Secre
tary of War in emergency cases. And
you further know that the appropna
ticn of J40U0 for the Napa River and
J~.OCO for the Sacramento River was
upon suggestion of Major Heuer, and
that you had nothing- to do with it." I
Mr. Bell admitted such to be the '
truth.
WITNESSES PRESENT.
The conversation en the train took I
place in the presence cf several wit
nesses, among whom were J. W. Kava- Â¦
nagh. Thomas Dozier and the Repubii- '
(.an nominee, Duncan E. McKinlay.
The Republican State Central Com- j
'rr.itt^ has noted from time to time that
tie Democratic newspapers in the Sec
ond District claimed that Beil alone of
all the California Congressmen voted
against Cuban reciprocity and that Bell
v.as entitled to credit fcr obtaining ap
propriations fcr the Napa and Sacra
mento rivers. The Republican oratcrs
produce the record to show that the
claim cf the Democratic editors has no
: jundation in Justice. _
At the outset of the campaign The
Call stated the simple truthâ that the
>. nly measure cf legislation accom
plished by Bell was the amendment
abolishing the canteen at the State Sol
ders' Home, and for that achievement
the prohibition press of the country has
given tin all the credit he desires.
ROUND VALLEY BILL.
He introduced many bills, among
thÂ«?in the notcricus Round Valley bill.
Facts are coming to light which create
the suspicion that the bill as originally
presented by Bell was a monstrous
land grab- It seems that the Ukiah
Times had the temerity to publish the
bili for the benefit of Round Valley
readers, and as a result the Democratic
nominee fcr Congress ferociously as-
Bailed the editor cf the paper. Here is
the comment of the Times:

We' have had niany inquiries for small reui

prices from |200(Â» to $55W. IJulf the people

Our renting department is busy, but it woulil
be much more eo it we were able to find- more

There are very few of these to be had, although
many .".re vacant that rent at from |^0 to ?lf> a

Few large transfers of real estate
have been recorded since the beginning
of the recent heavy rains, but dealers
in all parts of Oakland, report a brisk
business in sniall residence properties,
the prevailing prices ranging from
$2500 to 54000. Local real estate men
rind no fault with the present condi

ia far better than they expected. AIt
most every dealer looked for a dull
season during the. Presidential carri'
paign, and they have been agreeably
surprised at the continued activity of
the market.
Two important building contracts
were filed during last week, one for a

the other for 120,00!) of construction

OAKLAND, Oct. lfi.â The combined
Sunday schools and choirs of the Epis
copal churches of Oakland,,. Berkeley
and Alameda celebrated the day of in
tercession for Episcopal Sunday schools
with a union service at Ht. John's
Church ihis afternoon, the service be
ing jointly conducted by the rectors of
all the Episcopal churches in the three
cities mentioned. The musical portion
of the service was rendered by the
choirs of Ht. Jc/hn's and Kt. Andrew's
churches of Oakland, Christ's Church
cf Alamedu and St. Mark's Church of
Berkeley.
Besides the members of the regular
Sunday schools ut the various churches
the eervue was attended by the tMU
dren of |hÂ« Mission qf the Goud Sa
maritan of Oakland, They were ad
dressed by the Rev. William Norman
Cluthrie. ructtr of Christ's Church of
Alaim rfa. who took &6 his subject "The
Work und Duty of Children." His serr
mon was readily understood, in part
the rector's address was aj follows:
Montgomery was arrested In New
Mexico for working h land-fraud
scheme and fraudulantly obtaining
about $200 from eight people of Ros
well. On the publication of his arre3t,
thirty men and women of this city
Kent the above named men to the Chief
of Police last night to ascertain
whether Montgomery could not be
prosecuted. Rothchild said that each
of the thirty had contributed from $25
to $40 to thtt crook.
Montgomery's scheme was to present
payers showing porfer of attorney
granted him by certain people, in the
taking up of land grants in Siskiyou
County of this State. He told his vic
tims that he was representing an East
ern syndicate which wanted to secure
a large tract of timber land in Sis
kiyou Countv. He said that one claim
was all that he could take up, and
that if he was given $25 apiece by
thuse who wanted to make some
money, he would secure the claims for
them and later, through his syndi
cate, purchase the grants at $1000
apiece.
Captain Burnett informed the vic
tims that Montgomery would not be
brought to this city unless the parties
who lost the money wished to pay
for his being brought here.
Rothchild. Shepston and Robinson
say they will swear to complaints.
Montgomery is alleged to have
worked ten or more people in Oakland,
and is said to be wanted in Kansas
City and Stockton for similar illegiti
mate operations. All of his deals were
consummated last April, and the land
was to be delivered the last day in
June. At that -time Montgomery dis
appeared and was not heard from until
arrested in New Mexico.
The apprehended man has a wife ana
a son living at 13 Twelfth street, Oak
land. It is said that he got many
thousands of dollars through bogus
land and minlns schemes.
Lew Rothchild of 409 Market street
and AJ Shepaton and A. C. Robinson
of 103:! Market street renorted to the
police last night that they, along: with
twenty-seven uthers, had been victim

You will also make such changes In the reg
ulations aÂ» are recommended by the commis
sion, and you will therefore call a special
meeting of the Hoard of Supervising Inspec
tor* for this purpose. You will also lay before
Ccpgress a request that the law bÂ« changed in
the various particulars recommended hy thÂ»
commission. I wish particular emphasis laid
upon the proposal of the commlsalon that ther<Â»
be created by law - speoial body thoroughly
t<> Investigate th* laws which are supposed to
provide for the safety of passengers on steam
boats, especially on excursion boats, where
the prime causes of danger are thÂ» overcrowd
ing and the flimsy an.! highly inflammable
character of the superstructures. Very truly
yours. THF.onORE ROOSEVELT.
The supervising inspector general has at
present no headquarters foree of speota!
agent?, so that it is undoubtedly very difficult
for him to exercise any adequate and direct
supervision over the various local divisions o."
the Inspection service. In each division he
must rely rhlefly on the fidelity and energy oS
the local heads; and If these fall to perform
their duty they muÂ»t be held accountable. Kb
must, however, exercise as thorough a super
vision as the nii-ar.s at his disposal altow. In
order that I may be informed as to the exact
condition of the service in all Its parts. I direct
you to order a searching Investigation In con
tinuance of the investigation of the commis
sion. Into the conduct of the central office and
of every outside cubdlvislon of the servtce save
that In New York.
So much for what the Department of Justice
has done In reference to the disaster. But in
addition to the men put on trial by the De
partment of Justice, action should bÂ« taken
againat thuse employes whose responsibility
for the state of things producing the accident
has been brought cut In the report of the com
mission. According to this report. It .appears
that in addititon to the two assistant inspact
tors who are now on trial, the supervising In
spector oi the Second District. Mr. Rodle. a.ml
the two local inspectors of the port of Ntw
York. Mr. Dumor.t and Mr. Barrett, should all
three be removed fnr laxity and neglect In
performlne their duties. As regards the con
duct of Mr. Rodie. Mr. ChlÂ«r dissents from the
conclusions of the four other Commissioners.
I agree with the conclusions Â»f the other four.
Laxity and neglect, where the consequence*
may be so terrible as they have been proved
In this case, cannot be passed over even wher<>
there has been good conduct in other respect*
by the present men Implicated. Accordingly,
the three officials named wit? be removed from
the service. Moreover, you will pleaÂ»e direct
their successors in offlvÂ» t.> at (inn conduct i
thorough examination of th? entire inspection
fcrce of the port of New York, with the ob
ject of weeding out all tha men whom sut-h
examination shall s^ow to bÂ« unfltt'd \o per
form tit.- very arduous and responsible duties
of their positions.
Lundberg had been appcinted merely on pro
bation in the service and has been dropped.
There can, of course, be no further action
taken against Fleming until his trial has been
finished, although it does not follow that an
acquittal would prevent the Department of
Juatlco from discharging him from the service.
In addition, the Department of Justice has
secured Indictment of the manager and three
employes of the Nonpareil Cork Works of Cam
den, N. J.. for putting upon the market com
pressed cork blocks for uae In making life pre
servers, each of which block contained; In Its cen
ter a piece of bar Iron weighing several ounce*.
This last ii ff â¢â¢:'..-'â¢ was of so heinous a character
that it is difficult to comment upen It with
proper self-restraint. It appears that the Na
tional Legislature haÂ» never enacted a law pro
viding in set terms for the punishment of thiÂ»
particular species ot Infamy, doubtless becaus*
it never entered the head of any man that so
gross an infamy, could be perpetrated. I sug
gest that you report this whole matter to Con
gress, transmitting these two reports and at
the same time calling special attention to the
needÂ« of imposing an adequate penalty for the
making or selling ul defective life saving appli
ances.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 16.â The report
of the United States Commission of In
vestigation on the disaster to the
steamboat General Slocum was made
public to-day. In connection with the
important findings of the commission
presented in the report. President
Roosevelt, to whom the report was
submitted, has written a letter to Sec
retary Metcalf of the Department of
Commerce and Labor briefly summai -
izing the report and directing him to
carry into effect the recommendations
of the commission. He also directs that
Robert S. Rodie, supervising Inspector
of the Second District, steamboat in
spection service, and James A. Du
mont and Thomas H. Barrett, local in
spectors in charge of the port of N>w
York, be discharged from the service.
the commission noiding them directly
responsible for the laxity of the steam
boat inspection to which the Slocum
disaster was directly attributable.
Appended to the report is a report
from the Department of Justice on the
criminal proceedings connected witTi
the disaster, and the life preserver
cases.
The President's letter to Seeretary
Metealf foHows. dated October 13:
I have received the report ef thÂ» "Commis
Â¦ion of the f'nited States on the Investigation
of the Central fc-Ioeum Disaster." an<} the re

Department of Justice in connection with thÂ«
criminal proceedings taken against various In
divldualc because of their connection with th*
disaster. I swnd herewith both reports.
Punitive action by the Government can. of
course, only take two forms: One, that of legal
proceedings asatnat these either within or
without the service, and. two, removal cf thoÂ»Â«
within the service from office. It appears that
the Dtpartment of Justice has already teeurÂ«<1
indictments against the master and captain of
the Slocum and against th; managing directors
of tho Knickerbocker Steamboat Company, to
which company tha Sloc-tim belonged, for mis
conduct, negligence and Inattention to duty by
the captain an-1 for aiding and abetting therein
by the managing directors. Furthermore, the
Department of Justice has secured Indictments

Informal addresses dealing with the
well-known ohjects of the Audubon Ho

scopo of the society's work was out
lined by Professor Hitter. He said that
literature would be procured from the
bird protection committee of the Amer

tion in California. This literature deals
with the economic value of birds, the
evils wrought by hunters and the in
centive bird-killers receive from wunir.

hats.
Literature is also to be received from
the Ujnlogtcal Survey of the Agricul

which will discuss lh<> influence? of
birds upon'; crops and other features of
bird life and activity.

Hunger likewise checked the enthu
siasm of the pilgrims and they stopped
in their pursuit after feathered vic
tims to forage for supper. This hav
ing been their first experience, food
was somewhat difficult to obtain. The
youngsters did not possess the, nerve
that older strangerg in the tramping
line acquire. Worn oiit and all thought
of ducks vanished, the wearied boys
sought shelter. In their slumbers
they of mighty sport only to
be uroosed by the stern call of the

County Jail.
In response to telephone messages,
a bunch of relieved relatives arrived
at the jail and escorted the juvenile
fugitives back to home and better

set out yesterday afternoon for the
duck ponds. Each had provided him
self with a pistol, 22-raliber size, and
between them the disciples of the
sport had 300 rounds of cartridges.
The journey in search of the succu
lent game went well enough until
nightfall overtook the plodding hunt
erg at the outskirts of the city's sub
urbs.

The assemblage was called to order
by Frances Griffiths, president of the
parlor, who in a short address ex
plained the reason for the visit. The
drill corps, in natty uniform of dark
blue with gold trimming and each
member wearing a Jaunty cap, was
then escorted into the hall by the Se
quoia drum corr>s. The first number on
the programme was the singing of
"America," followed by a violin solo by
Rose Manning, a member of the visit
ing parlor. This was followed by the
singing of "Astore" by Ruby Davis,
also a member of the parlor. For an
encore she sang sweetly "Annie Lau
rie," and during the singing it was no
ticed that quite a number of the old
people, who were most attentive listen
ers, Â£ave way to tears.
5 Then followed the singing of "The
Star-Spangled Banner," and with the
first notes nearly all the inmates rose
and joined in the chorus, proving that
I their love for the flag, notwithstanding
changed conditions, is still strong with
in them. Instrumental selections on
guitar and mandolin were played by
Dr. Broad and Frank La Torres.
Little Gracie Allen pleased the audi
ence with a song and dance, and then
four young pupils of Miss Allen danced
an Irish cotillonâ a number that de
lighted the aced inmates, who mani-
I fested the pleasure they felt by long
[applause. Mr. Kentzel of Sequoia Par-
I lor sang ballads, and the Kreig sisters,
members of La Vespero Parlor, ren
dered several musical selections. The
past grand president. Belle W. Conrad,
spoke on the object of the order of Na
tive Daughters and of La Vespero Par
lor's act in coming so far from their
homes that enjoyment might be fur
nished to those who were greatly in
need of it.
| The assistant superintendent of the
Almshouse thanked the ladies of the
parlor for their kindness. E. C. Stock
spoke of the unselfishness of the mem
bers in leaving homes and friends on
their day of rest that many might have
a few hours of recreation and divertlse
ment frt>m the humdrum of life in the
home and on the farm. The programme
closed with the singing of "The Red.
White and Blue," followed by an exhi
bition drill, in which the drill corps
gave a good exemplification of military
movements, each being executed with
precision.
The Pa.ra.iso Sorlnss are always oaeo. *
The inmates of the Almshouse were
pleasantly entertained yesterday after
noon by the members of La Vespero
Parlor No. IIS, Native Daughters of the
Golden West, assisted by the uniformed
drum corps of Sequoia Parlor No. 160 of
the Native Sons. The meeting hall
was crowded with the inmates of the
home.

ENTERTAINING
AGED INMATES
The German-American Union of
California held its first meeting' yes
terday at Eintracht Hall. It was
called German day, and was a success.
The object of this union Is to foster
the German language and physical
culture.
Over sixty German societies of this
State were represented. Delegates came
from every section and large numbers
of the different societies came from
the cities about the bay. The exer
cises began at 10 o'clock in the morn
ing and continued until midnight. More
than 5000 people participated? The
exercises opened with the convention,
the principal feature of which was
the organization of the union as a
State league. Following this came the
formal reception to the delegates from
the differnt sections of the State. The
afternoon session lasted from 2 until
6. It was made up of an interesting
programme, composed of musical se
lections and athletic features by
classes of youths and young girls. The
feats were all accomplished in first
class style, and received by the great
audience with thunders of applause.
Among, those who particularly dis
tinguished themselves were members
oi the Eintracht turn section, led by
Professor H. C. Stahl; members of the
San Francisco Turn Verein, led by
Professor Hans Goetz, and members of
the Mission Turn Verein,' led by Pro
fessor \V. Bach.
Between the afternoon and the
evening session a promenade concert
took place to the music of Louis von
der Mehden's Orchestra. The even
ing's entertainment began at 8 o'clock
before an audience that completely
filled the hall. The music was of a
very high class and the splendid sing
ing of a number of the German socie
ties was a great feature of the enter
tainment. Besides the German na
tional anthem, the "Star Spangled
Banner" occupied a conspicuous place
on the programme.
Frank J. Syrnmes, the president of
the Merchants' Association, delivered
an able address on the friendly com
mercial relationship existing between
this country and Germany. Next year
the union will probably hold its meet
ing in the Mechanics' Pavilion.
Following are the officers of the
union: Professor Hugo K. Schilling,
president; Dr. Julius C. Voje, first vice
president; A. Entzmann, second vice
president; F. Gessler, recording secre
tary; Carl W. Mueller, corresponding
secretary; H. Kessel, financial secre
tary: John Hermann, treasurer. Dr.
F. Kuckein. the ex-president, also
ts.kes an active part in the adminis
tration of the affairs of the associa
tion. "; ':Â¦':'.

WEATHER REPORT.
The British ship Acamas, Captain
Nelson, arrived yesterday, seventy
fcur days from Newcastle, Australia.
She experienced the usual bad weath
er and high seas, accompanied by
strong southwest gales, which appear
to fall to . the lot of all vessels in
those waters. August 29, while the
crew was trying to secure a sail,, Alex
Linquist, a seaman, was washed from
th<- jibboom. The ship was pitching
into the high head seas and as the
bcom emerged from the wave that
overflowed it, the seaman lost his hold
and was dragged from the footrope
into the sea. He was swept passed the
vessel and astern and it seemed that
he was a lost man. A boat was, with
difficulty lowered and the ship heaved
to. Linquist. being a good swimmer,
never lost his nerve, but kept on the
surface of the ocean and awaited the
rescue. For almost an hour the boat
searched for him and at last found the
sailor almost perishing on the waste
of waters. He was taken aboard and
after several hours' hard work row
ing over the wild waves the boatmen
succeeded in regaining the ship.
X<j dearth of activity besets ihe mind
â¢hese days and there is sufficient for
â¢ill the inclinations. The Imp of Ani
mation has begun his capering and
I tips slyly into holies that expect him
not, or mayhap he dons a mask â a false
face, as the children have it â but with
a.11 his roguishnefs he is given wel
come, for spirit is contagious and
waxxns the heart of those who receive
ii royally. Then. too. devotees are
bowing before the shrine of Hymen.
i>'ho woos and win? unceasingly as the
autumn d^ys are marching on to win
ter. Xt-ithor does the calendar in pros-
Ptct show a falling oft in converts to
his wiles.

lombano, Chiavari. Italy. What is
known as the "Domesday Book" or
"Doomsday Book" is a book of the gen
eral survey of England, commenced in
the reign of William I, 1080 (some say
1085), and completed in 1086. It was
intended to be a register to determine
the right In the tenure of estates, and
from it the question whether lands be
ancient demense or not is sometimes
still a question. The book, formerly
kept in the chapter house of West
minster, was transferred to the public
records office. It consists of two vol
umes, a greater and a less, wherein all
the counties of England, except
Northumberland, Durham. Westmore
land and Cumberland, are surveyed.
This dbmesday book was the textbook
of King William. The taxes were
levied according to this survey till
12 Henry VIII. 1522, when a more ac
curate survey was taken, called by the
people the "New Doomsday Book."

GREAT-GRAXDPA HENRY GASSAWAY DAVIS is reported ;
to be carrying on a Bourbon campaign in the States of West
Virginia and Maryland. He is likewise credited with some j
fiery utterances upon the present sad drift of the republic toward I
the iron grip of militarism and its obsession to the idea of an over- 1
whelming army and navy. In his recently delivered letter of ac- i
ceptance he makes some interesting comparisons between the
strength of the United States army to-day and that of the military
arm of the service in the good old days of President Buchanan. Upon j
these comparisons he is elaborating his campaign arguments.
In i860, according to the Democratic patriarch, the army cost!
Uncle Sam but $16,500,000: in 1904 the army appropriation was i
$115,000,000. "An army then (i860) was necessary to protect set
tlers from the Indians/' declares the hale and hearty candidate, "and :
to do other police duty in the unsettled portion of the country â con- ;
ditions which now do not exist."
Such conditions do not exist to-day â that is true. There are \
other conditions, however, which may have slipped the attention I
of Davis' mind. Back there in the late fifties when Davis' was only j
a mere boy, thirty odd, say, the United States did not know of the =
Hawaiian Islands save through the reports of missionary societies, 1
Alaska was indeed the Ultima Thule of any possible political aspir- '
ation, the Philippines had no more significance to us than Pata- j
gonia, and Porto Rico was known only as a nice place to seek !
during the winter. During Buchanan's administration the population \
of the United States was 31,000,000 and the army was employed in j
doing police duty. To-day our people number 82,000,000, exclusive i
of insular America, and an army smaller in proportion to the popula- J
tion than it has been since the war of 1812 is guarding a dominion
the third largest in the world. j
Of course the Democratic candidate for Vice President has the
advantage over all competitors in this matter of personal reminis- j
cence. He can probably tell offhand details of the fiscal administra
tion of President Zachary Taylor or cite revenue statistics from the
time of William Henry Harrison. But cannot some one touch up j
Great-grandpa Gassaway on facts of the present day and generation ? j

Editor The Call â The widespread at
tention centered upon the question of
divorce presents a very peculiar fea
ture. This is the fact that where two
parties agree to disagree there can be
no law enacted, much less upheld, to
bind them to the agreement. Yet all
this difllculty, and more of it to come,
arises through man's ignorance of cer
tain undeviating laws governing the
union of sexes. Christ, when asked
concerning marriage, stated "Marri
ages are made in heaven." Now hea
ven is a condition of the mind and
evidently he had reference to a law,
which was then, and is as yet, unknown
to the world. This law governs the
adaptability of one man to a certain
woman end is based upon soul quali
ties, or, speaking from the material
standpoint, upon chemical magnetism.
Man's body generates forces, which are
used by the individual in the manifes
tation of certain tendencies, habits and
inclinations, and unless they stand in
harmonious relation to those of the
woman, misconstruction of each other's
motives will arise, antagonism spring
up and in the end create incompati
bility and separation. T.his could be
avoided by a very simple method, a
comparison of each other's qualities,
which can be determined by each one's
nativity, not from an astrological
standpoint, but from a biological. Thus,
one possessing constructive scientific
tended' '3S will not be harmonious with
one who Is Inclined toward purely do
mestic proclivities; again, one disposed
to associate freely with the public and
delight in their company will not a^ree
with one who loves a quiet, retired life
In the Interior of home; and. lastly,
one whose habits are chaste will not
tolerate one who Is given to excesses
in that direction. The way society
travels toward self-destruction fore
shadows a time when this question of
compatibility of man and woman will
be the first necessity and the grooving
generation be trained to know exactly
what quality to seek In the opposite
sex, thus avoiding all lnharmony, Buch
as is exhibited in the marital relation
of the modern social organism.

THE DIVORCE QUESTION.
Nothing pertaining to the fashions
of past years is being used at pres
ent, and everything is quite new and
fresh. The heavier gowns and suits
are made of velvets and shaggy fab
rics and are extremely pretty in their
way. The coats with the vests are
all the rage and white seems to be
the popular color for them. They
are extremely fancy in effect and but
tons galore are used as the sole trim
ming. Much hand embroidery ap
pears on the latest models from Paris
and this shows that it is not con
fined alone to waists and undergar
ments. Handsome brown suits with
beautiful designs done with orange
colored silks 'are quite the thing, and
the many shirrs and puffs displayed
could not help but make a stunning
creation.
The shoulder capes of lace are a
new idea for cool evenings in October
and they are daintily decorated with
chiffon streamers and bows. The
opera coats and carriage wraps are
also exceedingly handsome and noth
ing Is left undone that might add to
the beauty of any garment. The
leather belt plays an important part
with the coats and they are worn five
and six inches wide.
Among the daintiest of garments
for winter wear are those fashioned
of taffeta silk. They are worn with
and without coats to match and noth
ing more becoming Is in vogue for
fall wear. Frills and fluffs are being
used on many of them and the auto
mobile veil â the inevitable â is the
main feature of the autumn girl.
Fringed taffeta made of the material
of the gown is used for the ruffles
on the skirt and very often the waist
is covered with them to form the yoke
part. The fancy girl, the elaborate
ly yet simply dressed maiden, is the
one for the coming season and she
will be prolonged Into the spring and
summer of the coming 'ear. The
mannish woman has had her vogue
and fashionable women hail with de
light the new awakening of Dame
Fashion.
Scotch plaid yarns furnish desirable
material for mldseason wear. The
peacock blue, green and black and a
rich Burgundy red, combined with
dark brown, are noticeable. These
come at 46 inches wide.
Dame Fashion could not possibly
have allowed the word Parsifal to pass
without first taking it for a name of
one of her ideas and the "Parsifal"
waist is becoming well known. Well it
might be. for it is a pretty affair, ex
tremely becoming to the woman with
the pretty figure, as it is tight fitting.
A vest is the feature.

TOOTHSOME DESSERTS.
"The honeymoon, as the term usually
Implies," says the Enterprise of Mu
tual, Okla., "is about as scarce in this
section as snowballs in August. "We
do not mean to convey that our people
never get married, for weddings are
getting of such common occurrence
that the boys forget to serenade the
contracting parties any longer.
"When one of our young couples get
married they do not spend a month
honeymooning, like it is the custom in
the East, but they settle down to the
routine of life with the one harmoni
ous purpose of building up a comfort
able and happy home. Instead of
'spooning' around over the country, at
tracting the attention of everybody,
looking sickenlngly lovable, and calling
each other all kinds of sweet little
'chestnuts,' the newly married may be
found at work the next day following
the nuptials. It may be the bride will
put out a big washing, while the other
half will be found plowing corn and
carrying water simultaneously."
Mrs. Emma Wynn was walking alons
Edgemont avenue, Chester. Pa., a few

THE girl who considers herself ir
resistible â is there anybody who
has never seen her? Impossible.
She is one of the dramatic per
sonae In the drama which every
; community Is playing on the well-worn
boards of Time.
It Is good fun to watch her. Like
Bottom in "Midsummer Night's
Dream," she thinks herself the star
performer in the cast. And she acts
consistently, whether she is arranging
her veil before the mirror, whether she
Is measuring her charms in a shop
window as, passing by, she sees them
there reflected, or whether she takes
a flower from off her gown to put 1*
In a young man's buttonhole, says
Dorothy Fenlmore in the Chicago
Journal.
When she walks down the street she
is deeply conscious of the men who
stare at her. Her haughtiness is meant
to blight any mere man who dares to
lift his eyes above the spot of court
plaster fixed upon her lifted chin, or
else her soft glance seeks to heal In
the self-same moment that It wounds.
"When she talks her conversation re
minds her hearers of a music box of a
single tune. She plays the same air
over and over â what Charlie said last
night, the attentions that she has re
ceived from Tom and Dick and Harry;
who called on her last week, and who
will take her to the theater to-morrow.
She is always speaking of love as of
an old acquaintance. And yet, 'tis
dcubtful if she would know him
should she see him. If he were to
stand right beside her, clad In his best
scarf, and his golden bow and arrows,
she would probably look right over
his head, unless somebody called her
attention to him. Imagine her, then,
absent-mindedly chucking him under
his ancient but saucy chin, with a
THE expansion in domestic commerce still continues, though
more irregularity marked trade last week. This was largely due
to warm weather over the greater part of the country, which
caused a lull in the regular fall demand for early winter goods. It also
checked the demand 'for fabrics in the South, though it was favor
able for cotton picking. In the West and Northwest it was very bene
ficial to the wheat and corn crops and stimulated the distribution
of general merchandise. So it was a many-sided condition, operating
in all sorts of directions.
But aside from the weather conditions the status of trade on
the whole was reported very satisfactory and full of promise. The
bank clearings of the country showed the excellent increase of 26.7
per cent over the corresponding week in 1903, and the aggregate
clearings were $2,456,000,000, with most of the important cities
ranged on the right side of the exhibit. The gain at New York was
44.7 per cent, due almost exclusively to the revival in business in Wall
street; at Philadelphia 20.5 per cent, at Chicago 10.2 per cent, at
Minneapolis 26.8 per cent, due to the increased demand for wheat
and flour there, and at New Orleans, the seat of cotton transactions,
23.8 per cent. Pittsburg, the center of the iron and steel industry,
gained only 3.8 per cent, but of the ninety-two cities reporting their
clearings, only twenty-five exhibited a decrease from 1903. This is
an excellent showing, as it indicates a general expansion of business
all over the country, irrespective of section. The failures for the
week were 206, against 208 last year.
The staples showed some irregularity. The wool market was
strong, but the warm weather was against a free demand for fall
and winter manufactured goods. Recent large purchases in hides
rendered this market firm, but less activity was reported. New York
reported a diminished call for dry goods. Lumber was quiet in the j
East, but active in the West, and building operations were reported !
larger in a number of large cities. The iron and steel industry !
is sending in reports of a steady but slow expansion. Provisions |
continue fairly active for domestic account, but the export trade
shows some shrinkage. General exports are irregular, the exporta- |
tion of wheat having shrunk to almost nothing, while flour ship
ments have also fallen off and current corn exports are also small.
The foreign demand for manufactures is gaining. Collections
throughout the country are said to be better than for twenty years. :
This is a rather broad statement, but it is made flatly, without any >
qualifications, by the recognized commercial authorities. The ex- j
ports of cotton for the season are extremely large.
The rosiest reports come from the New York Stock Exchange,
where everybody seems to be tossing up his hat and shouting "Good i
times !" The feeling in Wall street is actually exuberant. Every- j
body is apparently a bull on the stock market, and the result is that \
the public have again entered the market as buyers, the market has
started upward again, sales on the Exchange have greatly increased I
during the past few days and predictions of a coming bull market i
are as thick as leaves in Vallambrosa. Everybody has apparentlv
constituted himself a committee of one to hoist stock quotations. '
The bankers are patting investors on the back and advising them i
to buy standard stocks. Pools are once more floating, or about to ;
float, new issues of bonds and stocks. Foreigners have been at- i
tracted by this schoolboy enthusiasm and are again taking hold of
our securities as investors. Idle money is flowing out of the vaults j
wherein it has been taking a long rest and the whole sentiment of !
Wall street may be expressed by the single word, "Hurrah !"
This enthusiasm is all very fine and as long as it does not create j
an unhealthy boom is all right, perhaps. It certainly is better than 1
the pessimism which hung like a pall over New York for many Â¦
months. The New Yorkers say that it is genuine and fully justified '
by current commercial and financial condition*. They say that trade j
is certainly expanding and that another year of prosperity is as- j
sured. It is to be hoped that they are right.
On this coast activity still prevails in most classes of goods. ;
Farm products are particularly active, and what is especially gratify
ing is that they are bringing first-class prices. This is the condition
that gives the commercial reports from the Pacific Coast their con- 1
tinued rosy hue. j
FURTHER TRADE EXPANSION.

No. 1% high-heeled shoes.
It's a good enough game If you
know when it's finished. I used to
play one something like it myself when
I was a little girl, and I have not for
fotten how It feels. It did not mak?
an lota of difference to me that my
earrings were glass drops from a dis
mantled chandelier, that my whit*
satin slippers, much too big. had for
merly been worn by my aunt at danc
ing school, and that my robe of state
was made of paper cambric that cost '
cents a yard.
But this much I must say for my
self: I had the sense to play the gam*
in my own room, and, when I went
outside, I left my trappings packed
away with my other toys, discarded
my airs and graces, and faced the
world in my own image.
And I would advise the girl who ia
inclined to think she is irresistible to
do the same, if she wishes to know
life and love, to see both as they
really are.
careless "My, what a perfect darling!"
before she turned to some man stand-
Ing near to confess that she dearly
loved children.
GIRL WHO THINKS SHE IS IRRESISTIBLE
SHOULD FACE WORLD IN HER OWN IMAGE

"REvJCRADIO" never prescribes medicine, and
tha enly guarantee he will give is that if
first treatment falls to help you it is abso-
lutely "frea." Can anything be fairer?
"REXRADIfVS" very first treatment oftÂ»n
benefits, but the increase and permanence of
the benefit, if possible, depends on a few
further dally treatments regularly taken.
"REXRADIO" indorsed by "city physician"
at public meeting. He said. "I saw him
greatly benefit several ehronie cases In m/
offices. I strongly recommend him." (Name
at offices.)
" 'REXRADIO' In only 3 secondj made my 30
years' 'totally' deaf ear clearly hear distant
'whispered' sentences in view of audience.

by OHe. brief treatment caused "deaf mutt"
to clearly hear and intelligibly speak sen-
tences and numerous words. Over 2U at audi-

heard and repeated their werds. {Bring

"JJEXRADfO" rnada a second "deaf mute' 1

_above case) in a local "physician's" office.
"REXRADIO'S" first short treatment marvel -

"Frserrjasens.' 1 as thÂ« honored widow of
Cal. "Grand Commander, ef Knights Temi

greatly inflamed, immensely swollen. First

" 'REXRADIO" went with me sse sadly af-,
flieted 'bedfaaf man. full of pain, helpless,
couldn't rise from bed or move limbs several
years. I saw the (one) treatment and pa-
tient astonished me by rising (unassisted*

gained normal power; sevÂ«re pains suddenly
eeased. Chan-; was so great and qutek it

Japanese Minister Will Meet Prince
Fushimi on His Arrival From
the Orient.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 16. â According
to present plans Mr. Takahlra, the
Japanese Minister, will himself go to
San Francisco to meet Prince Fushimi,
1 special envoy of the Emperor of Ja
pan, who will arrive In this country
about October 29.
This unusual action is contemplated
because Prince Fushimi is probably
the most distinguished envoy Japan
has ever sent to this country. He is
one of the heroes of the present war
and was commander of the Japanese
forces at the battle of Nanshan Hill.
He will be officially entertained at the
legation at Washington and there will
be much ceremony to accord with his |
rank.
Takahira has not been absent from
Washington more than a few days In
two years and his trip to the Pacific
Ccast will be his first vacation.! If the
Minister is unable to leave the lega
tion at the time, one of the secretaries
â¢will. go to San Francisco to act as es
cort for the Prince and his party.
TAKAHTRA IS COMING

Fifteen Persons. In Addition. Ovem
come by Smoke From Blaze In
Tenement House.
NEW YORK, Oct. 17.â Four persona
were suffocated and fifteen were over*
come by smoke in a fire which ruined
a five-story brick double tenement*
house at 15 Moore street, Willlaxnsburg.
early to-day. Two of tne injured, %
boy and a girl, probably will die. In*
cendiarism is suspected. The dead:
EERTHA GLASS, 29 years old,
HENRY GLASS. 2 years.
SAMUEL RUBENOWITZ, 4 years.
MAX RUBENOWITZ. 6 years.
The fire originated in the basement
and ran up a dumb waiter shaft, caus
ing the crowded flats to fill rapidly
with smoke. The flames spread through
the flats on the fourth and fifth floors,
and escape for tiro persons asleep thero
was cut off.
Firemen and police did heroic work,
and soon rescued more than a score, fif
teen of whom were almost suffocated.
These were removed to St. Catherine's
Hospital. Two children amons? tha
number were in a dying condition.
One fireman, in attempting a daring
rescue, was overcome by smoke and
had to be carried out by his fellows.
The loss was only about $3000.
Several fires occurred In the neigh
borhood during the early hours to-day,
all of a suspicious origin. They ap
peared to have been started by the
same hand, as all were discovered in
the basement of tenements. Only the
one noted, however, was accompanied
by loss of life.

It was after the alleged assault and
robbery that Ryan entered the res
taurant and Harper says Ryan had no
appearance of having been assaulted
nor did he make any complaint.
The police discredit Ryan's story. C.
"W. Harper, proprietor of a restaurant
at 2723 Sutter street, says Ryan en
tered his place and ordered a meaL
Ryan was drinking. After eating the
meal he walked out of the restaurant
and directly across the street. When
ho reached the car track he stumbled
and fell, striking on the back of his
head. Two gripmen and a conductor
on the Sutter street line saw him fall.
They carried him to the sidewalk. Car
Dispatcher Kennedy rang for the
patrol wagon and Ryan was taken to
the police station, thence to the. hospi
tal.
Michael Ryan, a laborer, living at
675 Mission street, complained to tho
police early yesterday morning that
ho had been assaulted and robbed of a
geld watch and chain by three mea
who followed him from the saloon of
Frank Maestrettl, Commissioner of
Public "Works, at Central avenue and
Sutter street, where he had been
drinking.
Two men â C. R- Goetgran, marbla
cutter, 1628 Central avenue, and B.
Vito, a teamster, living: at 123 Saa
Carlos avenue â were taken before him
and he said they were two of the mea
who had assaulted and robbed him.
Lieutenant Anderson at the Golden,
Gate Park Station declined to lock tha
two men up on Ryan's uncorroborated
statement, but gave him their names
and addresses, and told him he could
swear out a warrant for their arrest.
Ryan was sent to the Park Emergency
Hospital, where a wound in the back
of his head was stitched and dressed.

The soldier football players of the

the Brooklyn team at the Presidio
athletic grounds yesterday by a score
of 6 to D. Cooper, who played left
half for the soldiers, got the ball on
a fumble in the first half. He ran
nearly the length of the field for a
touchdown. Pinto kicked an easy
goal. -
In the second half the Brooklyns
took a brace. They pounded right
through the boys in blue and in
straight line bucks worked the ball
over the line. Ziska had a hard chance
for the goal kick and missed, leaving
the soldier leading by one point when
time was called. The Brooklyns were
a little shy on team work, while the
Fort Miley boys showed splendid or
ganization. The teams were made up
a.s follows:
J;"v R-Â« Â«-4 l.Vir. in Hmlth-s favor; Marius
ilotchklss beat M. Lcp.r. 6-4. 6-.1. 6-3.

Hotchkiss also qualified for this round.
In the upper half. Griffin and Code
will fight for the other place in the
tÂ»=mi- finals. The fourth place in the
semi-finals lies 'between Whitne*- and
Smith. _ ;:.
The match between Grant fcmith
and R. N. Whitney was one of the best
ever played at the Park. Both men
were at their best, and the spectators
were treated to some great tennis.
Smith won the first two sets. After
but two points had been played in the
third set he was seized with a severe
cramp in the leg that made further
play out of the question. .
Smith played as well as he ever did
and Whitney drove in his old-Â«me
form. Both sets were close, but Smith
had a shade the best of it throughout.
He not only volleyed Whitney's terrific
drives but placed them to the corners-
In the third set. which was started
after 5 o'clock, each had won a point
when Smith was forced to retire De
spite the fact that Whitney and Smith
had agreed to cease playing at .5
o'clock. Whitney claimed he was (en
titled tb the third set by default. W ith
this agreement, which was a verbal
and not a written one. Whitnev, m
pressing his claim to the third set. lays
himself open to criticism. Only tuo
points had been played, and. as Smith
had won both sets, there is no reason
to presume that Whitney would have
won the third.
Fmith beat Herbert Long in straignt
sets. He was at his best, while Long
was off in his play. The latter won
only three games in as many set3. The
results:
Ssome of the best tennis ever seen at
Uulden Gate Park was played yester
day. All of the expert players, with
the exception of Murdock. performed

NEW YORK, Oct. 16.â Young Corbett
will depart for San Francisco with his
trainer, Harry Tuthill, to-morrow on
the Twentieth Century limited. He will
stop over in Denver for two days and
will then go on to the coast and begin
hard training for his bout with "Bat
tling" Nelson. He had not decided to
night whether to take "Kid" Broad
along with him as sparring partner.
Young Corbett takes the pledge to
morrow morning to abstain absolutely
from liquor, cigars, cards, betting on
races and other diversions until he fin
ishes his whirlwind fighting campaign.
This includes an encounter with Nel
son, a return fight with Terry McGov
ern, an invasion of England to meet
Jabez White and a siege with Britt.
In his training Young Corbett will
work with a set of apparatus designed
by Professor Sargent, the physical in
structor of Harvard, which tells just
how strong one is and just how fast.
With the aid of an ingenious electrical
contrivance the boxer will be able tc
tell to the one-hundredth part of a sec
ond how fast he is punching and
whether he shows improvement in
training In hitting over a given dis
tance from a given angle. He will know
to an ounce how many pounds of hit
ting power he is putting into his blows
and whether his work is developing
him.

Of Young Corbett
The last trotting meeting of the
Grand Circuit for 1904 will open to
morrow at Memphis track. In addi
tion to many purses and stakes of
value to be decided, there will be at
tempts on the part of Lou Dillon and
of Major Delmar to lower the world's
trotting record without the aid of a
wind shield or a runner in front, as
were uged last year in all the record
breaking performances. Lou Dillon
has shown faster work this year than
ever before, and should she find good
weather at Memphis the two-minute
mark will doubtless be reached and
perhaps lowered by the dainty Cali
fornia mare. Major Delmar holds the
technical championship, his mile in
2:01% at Lexington track recently
lowering the mark of Cresceus by a
half second. While the names of Lou
Dillon and Major Delmar appear in
the Year Book with the respective
marks of 1:58^ and 1:59%, opposite
them there is an asterisk which ac
companies the records in the cham
pionship tables. This indicates a wind
shield was used in the peformances.
It is to obliterate these stars that Mr.
Billings and Mr. Smathers will start
their great trotters at Memphis next
week, and every horseman is hoping
they will "knock the spots" off their
previous records.
Another big event to be decided at
Memphis is the race for the $5000 gold
cup, one race for which was won by
Mr. Smathers with Lord Derby in 1902
and the second by Mr. Billings with
Lou Dillon in 1903. These events are to
wagon with owners driving. No betting
is permitted on the race.
A feature of the great race in the
Kentucky futurity this year won by
the tiny mare Grace Bond, who trotted
the first, second arid fifth heats all
below 2:10, a feat never before accom
plished by a three-year-old, was the
removing of all her boots before the
last heat. Her opening mile in 2:09%
was easily done, but she tired percepti
bly at the finish of the second heat in
the same notch. Then Alta Axworthy
When the elbow boots were gone
Andrews added a pair of hind shin
boots with scalpers and hock attach
ments to the pile. Then he removed
a patent breeching that was more or
less of a burden for the little mare to
carry. What he had taken off her
made a weight just over five pounds.
This sort of common-sense treat
ment made a. 2:09^ trotter for the
fifth and deciding heat of the race out
of n mare that had tired after going
a little over five-eighths of a mile in
the fourth heat, in which the time of
the winner was 2:13. It won a race
worth $10,000 to the owner of Grace
Bond and it decided the ownership
of something like $250,000 bet on the
race.
Nominations to the Pacific Breed
ers' $7000 Futurity have closed. This is
the richest stake offered on the Pacific
Coast for trotters and pacers and has
been a successful one ever since its
inception. This will be the fifth re
newal of the stake.
won a couple of heats in time that was
relatively slow, 2:ll 1 / 4. 2:13â and prob
ably there was not one man on the
ground who thought Grace Bond had a
chance to win.
When Billy Andrews, the filly's
driver, suggested to J. T. Gatcomb, her
owner, that Grace Bond would. In his
opinion, have an outside chance if a
lot of her heavy boots and trappings
were removed, he showed a far deeper
knowledge of the effect of such para
phernalia on a tired horse than most
horsemen possess.
The move was a Napoleonic one.
Every man who will think the matter
over a little must admit that, to do
any good, elbow boots must be so
firmly fastened that thsy interfere to
some extent with the free action of
any horse that wears them. Conse
quently they are tiring in much the
same fashion, but to a less degree,
than hobbles. As a matter of fact
Grace Bond, a midget trotter, was
wearing elbow boots not because she
needed them, but for the reason that
Gatcomb was afraid she might some
time hit herself.

The coursing at Ingleside Park yes
terday afforded exciting sport for the
spectators. The hares were unusually
strong and many of them outran the
doga and made good their escape.
T. J. Cronin met with some poor luck.
His dogs, Vandal and Fair Tralee. were
beaten in the final of the open and of
the class stakes, respectively. In both
instances they were made strong fav
orites. They led and made the first
few points, but were outworked by
their opponents. Tom Hurlick showed
himself a clever dog by taking the open
stake. When he was placed on the
hare it was nearly impossible for his
opponent to score.
Vina proved the best in the postponed
Reserve stake and easily defeated Com
mercial Traveler in the deciding course.
The betting was unusually heavy
throughout the day and the talent suc
ceeded in getting the best of It, al
though in the finals they lost heavily
on Cronin's dogs. They freely laid 2%
to 1 against the winners. Following
are the day's results, with Judge John

Union Coursing Park yesterday the
bettors who like to take a chance on
a long shot saw visions of fat pocket
books and good cheer.
The talent installed Little Dainty a
one to ten choice over Glaucus for the
Reserve stake, owing to the latter hav
ing had severe running. To tne evi
dent delight of the pikers Glaucus
scored the first four points. He then
made a drive to kill, but missed and
stumbled. Before he could recover
Little Dainty took possession and
quickly ran up a winning sequence.
La Rosa beat Hudson pointless for

NEW YORK, Oct. 16.â The racing
scene shifts to Long Island to-morrow.
On its grounds at Jamaica the Metro
politan Jockey Club will begin its au
tumn meeting. The card which it pre
sents suggests midsummer In the class
engaged rather than the beginning of
the end of the season in this State. It
is one which not even the most enthu
siastic nor the most ambitious mem
ber of the young organization would
have dreamed of a year ago. It is add
ed testimony to the fact that in racing
as now conducted with its great public
patronage to recompense the associa
tions and the good purses \o reward
horsemen, there is neither spring nor
autumn,. as these terms were once used
to designate preparatory and waning
periods, but a continuous season ex
tending from April 15 to November 15-

curing a lead and winning by one run.
Graham began to get careless and er

'l lie Seals and the Cummuters fin
ished the reeling off of another series
yesterday afternoon at Recreation
Park, when Uncle's followers man
aged to win the second game of the
week, Bcore 5 to 2. The Commuters
played with a strong front on their
own battle grounds in the morning
and got away with that little engage
ment, 6 to o. The series ended with
four victories for Oakland, two for
JSan Francisco and one tied game.
An old-time rally with the bat after
two had been retired in the lifth in
ning put the Seals in lront and there
they stayed till it was all over. That
usual little miscue which wrecks ever
bo many ball games played a leading
part in the run getting and perhaps
Savo the Seals a game which they
were destined to lose.
The score was Oakland 2, San
Francisco 1 when Hildebrand bit off
a single in the fifth. The fans hardly
dared to hope, for two were already
retired and Buchanan was twisting
'em over fast, slow and otherwise.
Waldron raised a little hope by swat
ting: to center and when Meany as
eaulted the sphere right on the iÂ»iÂ«xus
and 6ent it out in Kruger's territory
the fans began to perform like ab
origines.
Kruger was anxious to wing the
ball straight to the plate and in his
haste he fumbled it and then tossed
eo wildly that it got away from
Byrnes. This let both Hildebrand and
Waldron ecore. Had the throw been
any place near the pan the side would
have been retired. Pat Dulled up
Â«t third and waited only a moment,
lor Irwln came through with another
wallop.
That was the game right there. It
made the score 4 to 2, for the Seals
got another one in the third, when
Joe Corbett lined one out over the
left field fence for the longest drive
seen at the park in years. Joe beat
out a bunt in the ninth and came
around on a sacrifice and another
drive from Waldron's club.
Boettiger. who served an appren
ticeship with Peter Lrohman, was re
ceiving Joe's offerings. His regular
hoodoo followed him. for he was laid
out with a rap on the finger in the
ninth inning. He made a bad start,
piling up three passed balls in the
first inning and letting Francks score
from second. The Seals were not in
condition in the next inning, for the
Commuters sent another one in on a
combination of bad plays.
When Corbett settled down he had
'em all looking backwards. Eight
fanned and the six hits were scattered
all along the line of action. Before
and after the fifth Buchanan was his
usual self and the Seals were buffa
loed to a certain degree. The field
ing- was erratic. Gochnauer being the
king of the erratic kids, with four
misplayp. The score:

with the good center of 280 points. His
nearest competitor was Chris Meyer,

who placed 348 to his credit.
In the medal shoot of the same club
Adolph Strecker was the leader of the
first champion class with scores of 225
and 224 rings.
Frank H. Bremer. in the cadet class,
proved he is carving his way to recog
nition in rifle circles by making the
good scores of 217 and 209 rings In his
medal string, a creditable score for any
marksman.'
G. M. Barley, the well known pistol
expert, is still in good form. He shot
four scores and made 92. 92. 91 and 89

Gladys Grey Says She Was Not En

Gladys Grey, an actress for love of
whom James Tavendale killed himself
in. this city Friday night, is employed
as a dance hall maid in the Casino
Theater on K street in Sacramento.
When interviewed last night concern
ing the young man's suicide Miss Grey
said that she had known him for some
time and that she had become ac
quainted with him in tha place where
she is at present employed. She de
nied that she had ever been engaged
to marry him, and expressed surprise
that he should destroy his life for her.
Tavendale was well known in Sacra
mento and lost his last position there

kept.

ing stunts up its sleeve.
Already the green room is becoming
a famous tea-table tryst, which will be
tripled in popularity by the Dixon ex
hibit of the week.
One of the vital functions of the
Sequoia Club is the greeting to famous
visitorsâ and a guarantee that they
shall not be bored goes with the invi
tation to be present. As a matter of
fact, the club is said to be an uncom
fort ble place for bores, be they men
or women.
The following excellent house com
mittee is serving for this term:
To-morrow night the Sequoia Club
will bid "how-de-do" to itself and Its
friends, who will foregather beneath
the club's own rooftree at the St.

ple will be guests at this first of a_
series of Tuesday "at homes," among
whom is Gertrude Atherton, the most
famous Californian of her day. The
night will be doubly auspicious, for
Maynard Dixon will exhibit his
sketches and drawings in the green
room, where the general public may
view them on Wednesday afternoon
and every afternoon and evening there
after until Sunday --.- ...
The exhibit will include the sketches
and paintings done recently by this
clever chap, who knows the desert and
its denizens- as intimately as does Mary
Austin, who paints in words the story
of the great gray waste.
Dixon's Indians are winning recog
nition in the critical East, even as in
his own big West, largely through the
posters done by him for Sunset Maga
zine, showing indisputable boldness of
treatment and a deep insight into the
aboriginal character. In his "Blanket
ed Navajo." drawn for a Sunset cover
some months ago, he won much atten
tion from Eastern folk. In this draw
ing is writ the whole tale of the red
man's wrongsâ his hopelessness and his
calm resignation to his fate.
O.VE OF MAYXARD DIXON'S DRAWINGS TO BE SHOWN THIS WEEK AT THE ST. FRANCIS.
Sousa. with a new march, a new
suite, the same old band and the same
old trick of conducting it, came back
to us last night. The AJhambra housed
a handsome crowd to hear him and the
applause was as lively as the conduct
ing. A lively handful of it met him
and continued until Mr. Sousa's swift
descent into the "William Tell." Only
the local respect for Rossini stopped it
there â one so hankered to applaud the
Sousa imitation! It was brilliant. All
the tricks that all the Sousa imperson
ators for all thÂ« time have spread
oxer the vaudeville bills were
there. He plays dumbbells with
his chords and makes pies with his
I-hrase with the best of his imitators.
He plays tag with the trombones and
pats lovingly the flute, as do they. And
he bangs out strings of notes and
scoops tfcein inâ Just as Herrmann picks
dollars out of the air â and all the rest,
vith the cleverest of tnem.
In fact, Sousa's conducting is as full
ef quotations as "Hamlet." One would
know it a mile away, anywhere â un
der the nose of the Sphinx at midnight
arid with only a donkey to conduct!
Ah. but it Is the result. There is no
other band quite like Sousa's. One is
sure of that every time one hears it.
And this year there Is to the full all the
irresistible dash and go, the rhythmic
magic, the tonal excellence for which
the band is famed. One got a rare taste
of these in the "William Tell," that
To-night the Majestic Theater will
contain one of the most fashionable
audiences that has ever assembled in
this city, the occasion being the bene
fit for the Outdoor Art League of Cal
ifornia and the attraction "A Japanese
Nightingale." The family circle will
contain as many richly gowned not
ables of society as the first floors, for
to sit in the "peanut gallery" 13 taken
as a lark for this occasion..
Mrs. -Lovell White, president of the
league, is much gratified with the re
sponse that has been made by the pub-
"Arizona" was revived at the Grand
Opera-house last night. The great
frontier play was appreciated by one
of the largest audiences of the sea
son. Its, popularity was attested at
every thrilling scene, and curtain calls
marked the end of each act. The cast
was a good one, though the perform
ers are practically unknown here. The
play affords each of the principals a
good chance to star. Escamillo Fer
nandes as Tony, the Mexican, made a
decided impression when his opportu
nity arrived. He Is admirably fitted
for the part, and his quaint actions
and still quainter ways of expressing
himself made a great hit with the
crowd. James Kirkwood as the master
of the great Arizona farm, acted the
bluff frontiersman to perfection, and
May McCabe, as his wife, had many
chances to please the audience. Carol
Arden. as Bonita, and Francis Justice,
as Lieutenant Denton, were the center
of admiration in every act. and both
carried off the honors well. The play is
billed for a run of two weeks.

Entertaining numbers follow one |
after another at the Orpheum this j
week. The new acts are all good and
the holdovers are the pick of last |
week's bill. The biograph picture which \
concludes the performance is a sur- i
prise in its termination and is one of i
the best ever thrown on canvas in this !
city. Five men "blow" a safe in a bank
and, after an exciting attempt to es- j
cape, during which they are closely i
pursued, lose two of their number. As I
a last resort they steal a locomotive j
and. while skimming over the rails, j
meet their fate in collision with anoth- j
er iron machine. The collision is en
tirely unexpected and the picture of it |
is perfect. When steam and smoke are '
cleared the scene of the two engines is j
shown, both masses of twisted steel
and splintered wood.
Josephine de Witt is above the aver
age as a violinist and vocalist. Her |
selections are good and she is heartily
applauded. Sinon and Paris open in a
novel act as "droll Greeks of olden Â¦
times," and introduce their work in a I
manner that wins them favor. A par- Â¦
ticularly well educated dog plays an '
important part in the act. Tec-how's ;
cats are just as popular as when they ;
appeared in this city two years ago. !
The little animals do marvelous turns !
and there is not a hitch in the act.
"A Xight in Venice," presented by !
three Italian vocalists and musicians; j
"Conversational Oddities," by J. A.
Murphy and Eloise Willard; "Twisted

sonator of stage favorites, complete the
show.

It is played by a company which j
brings to the whimsical comedy a flush :
of life and vim that would have de-|
lighted the lamented author, Hoyt, in Â¦'
his most exacting moments. Harry B. j
Emery is the Maverick Brander, and a
stronger or better portrayal of the part
could not be expected. Will H. Bray '
gives a splendid picture of negro char- j
acter as Christopher Columbus Jr. I
Fishback, the irrepressible colored poli
tician.
Bray created this unique character
years ago, and never has it been ade- ;
quately presented by any other actor, j
There is not alone the humorous side j
as given by Bray, but the actor with !
keen subtlety quickly turns from the |
ludicrous to so much genuine pathos as !
to set the audience a-thinking of the i
woes of poor political office-seekers in i
that great center of political life â i
Washington. D. C.
Miss May Stockton's Bossy is so clev- ]
er that one might rightly imagine the !
part had been anticipated for her by \
the author. The three terrors from Tex- \
as. Major Yell, Colonel Bragg and I
Colonel Blow, played by E. M. Kim
ball, Henry Brewerton and J. F. Maher,
were picturesquely Texan and formid
able. The quartet rendered its num
bers so weil as to receive no less than
ten encores.
"A Texas Steer" as played at the
California last evening well merited the !
approbation given by the amused audi
ence. Mason and Mason come to the
theater next week.
Miss Estelle Slebling, soprano, sup
plies this year the usual vocal back
ground for the band. She does a little
more than that, however, and used a
rather good voice rather well in
"Nightingale Air" from "Marriage of
Jeannette," by Massi. Miss Jessie
Straus is the violinist and possesses
agreeable temperamental gifts and
technical accomplishments. She gave
a clever rendering of the Hauser Hun
garian Rhapsody.
BLANCHE PARTIXGTON.
Another new number given last
night was the "American Character
Sketches," by E. R. Kroeger, pictur
esque and characteristic as to all but
the first "sketch." Grieg's "Parade of
the Dwarfs," written for the piano,
goes excellently with the band, as also
a transcription of Heller's A flat Taran
telle. The most interesting movement,
however, was the Wagner "Proces
sional of the Knights of the Grail,"
from "Parsifal," that was admirably
conducted and played. It lends itself
with large effectiveness to the resources
of the band.
After that came Herbert L. Clarke,
without whose cornet playing Sousa's
band would hardly be Sousa's band.
Sir. Clarke brings a "Valse Briliante"
of his own this year, and gave a beauti
ful and brilliant performance of the
piece. The new Sousa suite followed,
"At the Court of the King." in three
movementsâ a gavotte measure, a kind
of valse noble and a stately finale.
Rather of the made-to-order fashion
these sounded, particularly when com
pared with the "El Capitan" march,
still rattling good stuff of its sort, that
followed. Mr. Sousa's new march is an
other 6tory. "Jack Tar," as it is called,
will be on half the local pianos within
the week, and deserves to be. It com
pares with the best of the Sousa
marches.
swung to its spirited climax with the
fire of a Mascagni reading. And for the
encore Mr. Sousa did not keep us long
waiting. With his quick, courteous lit
tle bow he had "The Stars and Stripes
Forever" going in an obliging second,
ajid after it "The Dolls."
