Taotai's demand that the Russian gunboat Mandjur leave the harbor, â in; accordance with China's declaration of neutrality. Should the
Russian warship refuse to depart, she probably will be attacked in the harbor by the Chinese. vessels. A Japanese squadron is in waiting

"UNITED STATES SENATE. COM
MITTEE ON IRRIGATION, WASH
INGTON, Saturday, Feb. 20, 1904.
Hon. V. H. Metcalf, House of Repre
sentatives â Dear Kir: I desire to refer
to a statement contained in your re
cent letter, written by you to a gentle
man â who is also my friend, and which
is placed in my hands for reasons that
I have explained to you in conversa
tion with you this afternoon. The
statement is as follows
" 'Th<5 Republican members of the
House from California have met and
pone over carefully the question of
Federal patronage. We unanimously
came to the conclusion that, inas
much as the Senators claimed all the
Federal patronage in the State, we
would not, where there was a division
and the Senators could not agree, in
dorse any of the candidates, our con-'
tention being that the Federal patron
age should be at the disposal of the
entire delegation and not under the
control of the two Senators in this
matter, but let them fight it out be
tween themselves.'
OLD RULE DISADVANTAGEOUS.
"I confirm your statements that as a
rule, rarely infringed, the Senators have
claimed and exercised the right to
recommend for appointment to Federal
offices without formal consultation with
any member of the House delegation,
and that there have been several cases
where the Senators appear to be in dis
agreement in regard to certain appoint
ments. Indeed at the present time there
are four Federal offices occupied by in
cumbents whose terms have long ago
expired, and in Eomo of these cases no
urn*' appointments have been made be
cause the Senators could not agree.
"When I came to the Senate I learned
that the Senators from each State
claimed the exc?usive privilege of
recommending the Federal officers and
that California had been accustomed to
follow this rule. There seems to me to
be a good reason for the rule iii th%.
consideration that the Senators were
exclusively responsible for confirmation
of" the President's nomination, but I
could not understand, however, why the
Senators might not, with great pro

interests as well as of the welfare and
harmony of the party' in control, con-

-TACOMA, Wash., Feb. 23.â An un-*
usual storm of cyclonic fury swept over
Washington coast north of Grays Har
bor late yesterday afternoon. It came
across the Pacific Ocean from the
southwest, carrying destruction and
devastation for. an unknown distance,
its sweeping path being only fifty
yards wide. The greatest damage, so
far as reported, was done at Qulnault
Indian Agency, about fifty miles north
of Grays Harbor. Buildings there were
blown down and large fir trees were
uprooted. David Kerr was killed and
his wife and an old Indian known as
Sam were fatally injured. Several
other Quinault Indians were bruised
and injured. David Kerr and his wife
were in their house when the storm
struck it. The house was carried sev
eral yards and struck the ground with
such force as to demolish It.
A party left Quinault early this
morning for Hoquiam with the body of
Kerr and those injured. Their progress
has been slow, owing to the almost
complete obliteration of the county
road by fallen trees.
Great stretches of timber were laid
waste by the storm. Indians declare
that they have not known a storm of
such fury for at least fifty years.
The waves were blown high at West
port. Cohassett and other settlements,
washing away summer cottages that
weâ¢ built close to the beach.
Gr*.: t anxiety is felt for any vessels
that may have been in the path of the
storm. Residents of Hoquiam say that
it would be almost miraculous for any
craft to survive if struck with the fury
of the storm.
term to you, Mr. Needham, and Mr.
Loud, but I understood, nevertheless,
that this partial recognition of a cour
tesy supposed to be due to the House
members was not satisfactory, and that
therefore, as you have indicated, there
has been no disposition on their part
to offer or to give me the benefit of
their advice in such matters, and so It
has come about that we have been go
ing on with a rigid application of a
general rule, which I think turns out
to be disadvantageous to the public
service and the party to which we have
the honor to belong.
TIME TO MAKE A CHANGE.
"I am glad that your letter opens
the way for me to say to you that, in
view of the occasional instances where
the California Senators have failed to
agree in their recommendations, it is
in my opinion a proper time to make
a chang-e in procedure. There are two
steps by which an appointment is se
cured, namely: First, by a recom
mendation to the President, and next
by confirmation of his nomination by
the Senate.
"It is rarely that the President's
nomination is opposed, and it is to be
presumed that there will be no oppo
sition, except for causes grounded
upon conscientious scruples.
"But having in view that the recom
mendation to the President is the In
itial and important step, I have to
propose that hereafter all matters of
Federal patronage, except in the case
of postofnee appointments not con
firmed bv the Senate, shall be taken
up, for consideration by all Republi
can members from California in both
houses of Congress, at the call or sug
gestion of a Senator, with the under
standing that a decision of the major-

LONDON, Feb. 23.â Reports of a fresh, attack upon Port Arthur come from various
sources,. but the details are meager and contradictory. The capture^of several Russian torpedo
boats, the sinking of another battleship, a renewal of the bombardment of the town and the acci-.
dental destruction of a couple of destroyers are among- the reported occurrences. In several dis
patches from Chinese sources - two dates are given- for the battle/ but there is an agreement on
one point; namely, that the Russian torpedo [flotilla was in action and was not- well handled. --
Naval officers have expressed surprise v that the Russian flotilla was -not in better-condition

A pathetic incident of the robbery is
the loss of $1800 by a Mexican laborer.
He had accumulated that sum by care

carried his little hoard In a money belt
strapped around his waist. Down In

The laborers were sound asleep this
morning when the bandits entered the
car, which stands close to the railroad
depot. The robbers commanded the
men to line up against the side of the
car. Then while one of the robbers
kept his revolver pointed at the labor

forced each victim to disgorge what

were ripped open to get at the money

JAPANESE OFFICERS HANGED BY RUSSIANS AFTER BLOWING UP A RAILROAD BRIDGE
Members of Mikado's Gen

ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 23.â The
Japanese who were hanged by the Rus-
Eiar.s in Manchuria after partially suc
ceeding in an attempt to blow up the
railroad bridge over the Sangarl River
were disguised as coolies. They were
arrested just as they were about to
make the attempt. Inquiry revealed
that they were Japanese officers of the
general staff â namely. Colonel Assasi,
of the engineers, and Lieutenants
Zoneloiascja and Kaeurta, of the sap
pers. They were at once hanged from
the gJrderp of the bridge. â¢
The newspapers of Port Arthur, dated
February 4, reached St. Petersburg to :
day, indicating that they were less than
three weeks in transit. Troop trains
probably require a longer time, on ac
count of the difficulties at Lake Bai
kal, where provisions . and troops are
crossing: both on ice trains and sledges.
The coM is exceedingly severe. ' To-day
36 degrees below was recorded at
Irkutsk and. other places."
Ftories of the sufferings of the troops
in the crossing of the lake are persist
ent. Some reports say 600 men were
frozen, but these lack confirmation, of
ficial or otherwise.
WIKES ARE KEIT OPEN'.
The telegraph is working well. One
Hit?, devoted exclusively, to Government
business, runs direct to Irkutsk, whence
â with a single relay it connects with
St. Petersburg. The Czar recently stood
at the telegraph key and talked with
Viceroy Altxieff, practically uninter-
rupted.
Military men desiring to accompany
the Russian army have been formally
notified that they may proceed when
convenient, but it is added that accom
modations a.nd commissariat supplies
cannot* be guaranteed before March 15.
No authorizations have yet been issued
to war correspondents, and it is im
probable that anything in this direction
will b#> <lono until the concentration of
troops is completed.
The Chinese Minister here has pre
sented to the Foreign Office a note
similar in tenor to that handed to the
Government at Tokio. regarding
China's neutrality and the respect to
be. paid to the imperial tombs. It is
understood that Russia has not made
a specific reply, but communicated to
thf- Minister a copy of it? reply to Sec
retary Hay's note on the subject of
China.
PKOTKST TO THE -NATION'S.
Foreign Minister Lamsdorff yester
day sent the following circular to Rus-
sian representatives abroad:
"Since the rupture of negotiations
between Russia and Japan the attitude
of the Tokio Cabinet has constituted
open violation of all customary laws
governing the mutual declarations of
civilized nations. Without specifying
each particular violation of the laws
on the part of Japan, the imperial
Government considers it necessary
to draw the attention of the
powers to the acts of violence
committed by the Japanese Govern
ment with respect to Korea. The in
dependence and integrity of Korea as
a fully independent empire have been
fully recognized by all the powers and
the inviolability of this fundamental
principle was confirmed by article 1
of the Shimonoseki treaty and by the
agreement for this purpose between
Japan and Germany on January 30,
1902. as well as by the Franco-Rus
sian declaration of March 16, 1902.
"The Emperor of Korea, foreseeing
the danger of a possible conflict be
tween Russia and Japan, addressed
early in January, 1904, a note to all
the powers declaring his intention to
preserve the strictest neutrality. This
declaration was received with satisfac
tion by the powers and it was ratified
by Russia. \
"According to the Russian Minister
to Korea, the British Government
charged the British diplomatic repre
sentative at Seoul to present an of
ficial note to the Emperor of Korea
thanking him for his declaration of.
neutrality.
ACCUSATIONS IX DETAIL.
"In disregard of all these facts, in
epite of all treaties, in spite of its obli
gations and in violation of the funda
mental rules of international law, it
has been proved by exact and fully
confirmed facts that the Japanese
Government:
"First â Before the opening of hos
tilities against Russia, landed its
troops in the independent empire of
Korea, which had declared its neu
trality.
"Secondâ With a division of its fleet
made a sudden attack on February 8,
that is, three days prior to the declara
tion of war, on two Russian warships
in the neutral port of Chemulpo. The
commanders of these ships had not
been notified of the severance of diplo
matic relations, as the Japanese mali
ciousl3 T stopped the delivery of Russian
telegrams by the Danish cable and de-
Etroyefl the telegraphic communication
of the Korean Government. The de
tails of this dastardly attack are con
tained and published in an official tele
gram from the Russian Minister at

laws above mentioned, and shortly be
fore the opening of hostilities, the Jap
anese captured as prizes of war cer

MILITARY EXPERT'S VIEW;
Jeletz, a military expert who is to ac
company General Kuropatkin to the
front and whose opinions are conse
quently of increased value, predicts
that the Japanese will make their base
of operations along the line between
Pingyang and Wusan, Korea, relying
upon protection from their fleet against
a flank attack. The Japanese army
from this line will have to march 200
miles over mountainous country to the
Yalu River, where it will find the Rus
sians strongly intrenched. If it suc
ceeds in forcing this line back it will
find another strong Russian line ex
tending from the Yalu to Mukden. The
Japanese may then divide their forces,
using one-half to hold the Russians in
check while the other half goes south
to besiege Port Arthur. In this event
the Japanese will be liable to a flank
attack by the northern Russian forces
from Kirln
The appointment of Admiral Maka
roff to command the Russian Pacific
fleet has been published in the Gazette,
A Russian correspondent at Port Ar

of General Kuropatkin to command
Russia's military forces in the Far East
has been received with delight there.

MIKADO POSTPONES
HIS DEPARTURE FOR
TEMPORARY CAPITAL
TOKIO. Feb. 23.â The plan arranged
for the Emperor and the imperial head
quarters to move to Kioto has been
temporarily abandoned, and it is now
thought better not to move until after
the closing of the special session of the
Diet, early in April. The inconvenience
of removing the seat of government
and convening the Diet in Kioto is the
reason assigned for the change in plan.
Small interest is 'manifested in the
forthcoming general election. The war
overshadows all political questions Just
now. The country is united politically,
and it is expected that the new Diet
will fully support the Government and
cordially approve all measures concern
ing the war.
The Mikado to-day received in audi
ence Captains Lee and â¢ Paynter and
Lieutenant Boyle of the British navy
and thanked them for navigating the
Japanese armored cruisers Nisshin and
Kasaga from Genoa, Italy, to Japan.
The Mikado conferred upon them v the

take up the Russian note on the sub
ject -with the view of urging action by
the powers, and it is said that nothing
effective could be dene in this direction.
France was satisfied from the first of
the unjustifiability of the Japanese ac
tion, and is anxious that the other
powers should come to appreciate the
enormity of the offense.
In this connection attention is called
to the occupation of Korea by Japa
nese troops. It is pointed out that in
spite of the declaration of Korean neu
trality, which was communicated to all
the neutral powers as well . as to, the
belligerents, Japan has not hesitated to
throw troops into Korea and to estab-
lish a base there.
The tcne on the Bourse to-day was
exceptionally firm, with an upward
tendency, many securities regaining the
ground lost during the heavy decline on
Saturday.
FKANCE 3IAY PROTEST.
It is suggested In diplomatic circles
that France, which has been charged
â¢with the protection of Russian interests
in Korea, could properly make objec
tion to the Japanese action, but nothing
of this kind has yet been done. The
French legation in Jgeoul is in charge
of the secretary and interpreter, the
Minister being in Paris on leave of ab
sence, and the Foreign Office is show
ing no inclination to order his immedi-
ate return.
At the Korean legation here to-day
It was said that Korea had declared
her. neutrality from the outset and
that, therefore, if rW Japanese occu
pied Korean .territory and purposed
marching through Korea on their way
to Manchuria it was not with Korea's
assent, but because she was unable to
prevent it. The legation officials added
that the 50,000 stands of arms recently
ordered by Korea from France would
remain at Hongkong -for the present;
in order that they may not 1 ' be seized
by the Japanese.';. , âº
Nothing is known at" the French
Foreign Office regarding the report that
the Russian Embassador ,â  to ~;Great

ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 23.â General
Sakharoff, chief of staff of the military
district of Turkestan, has been appoint
ed to act as Minister of War during
the absence of General Kuropatkin.
whose appointment to command the
Russian military forces in the Far East
was gazetted yesterday.
"The war will end in August or Sep
tember, in the complete defeat of the
I Japanese," said a high authority in in
timate touch with the Russian war
plans, whose opinion can be taken
faithfully to represent the belief in the
highest official quarters. He added:
"How the Japanese can hope to suc
ceed when our army in the Far Ea3t
is strengthened to a point equal or
superior in numbers to that of our
adversaries we are honestly unable to
comprehend. It will not be difficult to
place two, four or even six hundred,
thousand additional men in the field if
necessary. When our forces are con
centrated and ready they will finish by
driving the Japanese Into the sea.
"Frankly, it seems to us that the I
Japanese either have utterly failed to
appreciate Russia's resources or have
counted on the aid of Great Britain or
the United States, neither of which j
powers ever contemplated becoming in
volved. So far as Great Britain is con
cerned, we do not believe any halluci
nations existed there. We think the
British statesmen who did so much to
push Japan into war realized that with
Japan's defeat they would accomplish
two things for Great Britainâ first, to
give Russia a checkâ for, of course,
the war must impede our progress tem
porarily; second, to cripple Japan'3
maritime power, which was beginning
to be greatly felt in the Pacific.
RUSSIA T9 BIDE IIER TIME.
"It can be said with the utmost pos
itiveness that Russia will bide her time
and will act on the defensive until she
is confident that her weight of numbers
will leave no doubt as to the result.
Reinforcements are going forward at
the rate of 3000 per day. Probably some
time will elapse before Russia feels
prepared to assume the offensive.
"The conviction is growing here in of
ficial circles that in spite of Japanese
denials the Japanese fleet was severely
crippled off Port Arthur in the engage
ment which began on February 8. The
Admiralty has no direct official infor
mation to support this except the man
ner in which the Japanese abandoned
the attack at the end of forty-five min
utes. It is pointed out at the Admir
alty that two weeks have now elapsed
without the whereabouts of the Japa
nese fleet being definitely reported, and
the opinion is gaining ground that it
has gone to a Japanese port for re
pairs."
He pointed out also that it had al
ways been the Japanese policy to an
nounce only, victories, adding:
"We know they sustained losses in
the China war which were never ad
mitted."
STATUS OF KUROPATKIX. ; V.
General Kuropatkin will not leav# for
another fortnight. In the meantime he
is going to his country estate to bid
farewell to his relatives. His status
has not yet been fully settled. By the
terms of his appointment the general
will command the Manchurian army,
subject to Viceroy Alexieff. but his
powers probably will be extended to
include the troops north of Manchuria.
The official view of the status is that
Viceroy Alexieft will remain in supreme
command, but the Viceroy being a
sailor General Kuropatkin will be ap
pointed his lieutenant for the army, as
Admiral Makaroff is for the navy.
The Viceroy's departure from Port
Arthur was not due to apprehension of
the possibility of its Investment, but
simply to the requirements of the
strategical situation, so as to enable
him to direct the operations now in
progress along the line of the Korean
frontier from a more central point. Pos
sibly he will not remain at Mukden,
but will go from place to place as cir-
cumstances demand.
Speaking on the subject of the pos
sible investment of Port Arthur, the
military authorities here do not be
lieve the Japanese will attempt to
make a landing in force on the Liao
tung peninsula. They say there is
nothing the Russians would like bet
ter, as such an attempt is doomed to
certain failure. The authorities here
assert that the southern portion of the
peninsula is strongly guarded and that
the northern shore presents insuper
able obstacles. The only chance for
the Japanese, it is claimed, would be
to march down from Korea, but to do
this, it is added, they must first de
feat the Russian army on the Manchu
rian side of the Yalu River and, even
if successful, they would be face to
face with an impregnable stronghold.
ALEXIS REMAIN'S AT HOME.
Grand Duke Alexis (uncle of the
Czar and high admiral) has reconsid
ered his determination to go to the
Far East. He Is extremely anxious to
go, but the Grand Duke felt that his
duties here would necessitate his re-
maining in St. Petersburg.
The Russian Government has no of
ficial confirmation of the report that
the foreign commanders at Chemulpo,
except the commander of the United
States gunboat Vicksburg, protested
against the Japanese entering the har
bor of Chemulpo. A preliminary re
port from Captain Roudnif of the
sunken Russian armored cruisr Va
rlag, the senior officer, says Admiral
Uriu served notice that if the Rus
sians did not come out he would "or
der" the foreign ships to leave the
harbor. Extended reports have been
mailed by Viceroy Alexieff.

WHAT TEA DOES TO
RHEUMATICS.
"When you next take tea, think of thla.
Tea contains 175 grains of Uric Add
In every pound.
Meat contains only &â¼â¢ to â even
grains.
Rheumatism is Uric Acid In the blood.
Uric Acid accumulates from food whea
the digestive apparatus cannot create
enough AlkaJlne elements (lik-> soda) to
neutralise it.
This Acid collects urea, or wom-Â«ut
â waste matter, from the system.
That Urea enters the blood when Alka-
line action has not previously dis-
solved it.
By and by the waste matter reaehe*
the joints and muscles, through circula-
tion of the blood.
There it gradually deposits in solid
particles, like granulated sugar.
These solid particles grind between
the joints and muscles at every move-
ment.
This grinding causes irritation mnd
pain.
These In turn may develop inflamma-
tion and swelling. That inflammation
jbestirs Nature to help herself.
' She proceeds to coat the hard Uric par-
ticle* over with cushions of pulpy mu-
cous, like the erst healing strata of an
outer sore.
This pulpy covering grows to thÂ«
bones, as well as to the particles deposit-
ed. There it hardens like- plaster or
sealing wax. Then we have "bony
joints, ' almost inflexible, and usually
fixed in a bended position, from the pain
and inflammation.
That is Rheumatism at Its worst.
It Is bad enough before It gets that
far.
There is but one sure way 4 of enrin<
Rheumatism. The first step is to neutral-
ize the Uric Add already tn the system.
Next, to dissolve, and carry away, tho
hard deposits that grind between the
Joints. Then get the digestive apparatus
into such healthy condition that it will,
unaided, produce less Uric Add. and
more Alkaline*.
This is what Doctors generally have
failed to do.
It is what I studied a lifetime to ac-
complish, and achieved only after man?
failures and thousands of experiments.
At last I found, in Oermany. a Solvent
which was not only effective, but abso-
lutely safe to use.
Few agents powerful enough to be ef-
fective In Rheumatism are safe.
â¢ My discovery, now called "Dr. Snoop's
Rheumatic Cure," acts directly, but in-
ternally, upon Uric Acid in the joints
and muscles.
It dissolves, and carries off. the pain-
ful deposits, producing an immediate Al-
kaline condition of the blood, and neu-
tralizing the Acid in it which would
have fed the Rheumatism and extended
the disease.
It won't restore bony joints to flexibil-
ity, and it can't undo, in a week, tha
damage caused by years of rheumatic
condition.
But it will benent every case, and it
will entirely cure most cases of Rheuma-
tism.
So sure am I of thjs. that I will supply
Dr. Snoop's Rheumatic Cure, to any side
one who writes me for it. on a month's
trial, at my risk.
If it succeeds, the cost to htm is only
J5.50 for the six bottle treatment.
If it fails. I bear 'the whole cost my-
self.
And â he alone shall be the judÂ»Â« â
shall decide who shall pay.
Surely you will not continue to suffsf

ADVERTISEMENTS.
â¢ AN UXPLKASANT i.:XPFJRIENXE.
Has it ever been your unhappy lot to
be told by your physician that you
must go to a hospital to submit to an
operation? I? so, you remember with
what dread and shrinking you awaited
â¢ the day when you must endure the
knife.
The present day surpeon appears to
bÂ«* possessed by a mania for operating,
especially ln cases of hemorrhoids or
piles, and while the greater number of
' the profession do not recommend this
â¢'last resort" unless they honestly be-
lieve it necessary, the fact remains
that much needless operating is done,
and the patient put to much expense
and sufferingâ for what?
To obtain a possible temporary re-
lief; these words are used advisedly,
because in nine cases out of ten the
affliction returns and the patient is
Just where he started from. Oftentimes
he could be cured much more simply
and easily by the use of such a remedy
as the Pyramid Pile Cure; this has
rome to be recognized as the best rem-
edy on the market for the painful dis-
rase named, and the druggists now sell
more of it than all ether pile remedies
combined.
The writer personally knows people
who were afflicted with the worst form
of bleeding -and protruding piles and
â who were permanently cured by the
use of Pyramid Pile Cure. In every one
of these cases the attending physician
had assured the sufferer that only by
an operation could he rid himself of
the disease; so much for the infallibil-
ity of the doctors.
This remedy, which is sold by all
druggists at the low price of fifty
â¢ rents, is in suppository form, is applied
directly to the parts affected, and per-
forms its work quietly and painlessly.
The Pyramid Drug Co., Marshall, Mich.,
will mail free to any address a book
telling all about piles or hemorrhoids,
their cause and cure.
A pugsestion is offered that if the
reader is afflicted, or knows any one
â¢uho is, this book be sent for, as it will
be found invaluable.

SUMMARY OF THE CALL'S WAR NEWS.
Russia has sent a formal protest to the powers against what she regards as Japan's
violation of the neutrality of Korea. She alleges that the attack on the Russian warships in
Chemulpo harbor before the formal declaration of war was 1 in disregard of all treaties and obli
gations and in violation of the fundamental rules of international law. Japan now having as
sumed the administration of Korea, Russia will ignore all actions of the Korean Government.
The Russian commander of the gunboat Mandjur persists in refusing to leave Shanghai
to fall into the hands of the Japanese, though under the law of neutrality China has ordered
him to do so. China has now ordered two cruisers to that port to eject the Russian. Japan
threatened to take decisive steps if China did not. The United States squadron is assem-
Japan places no credence in the St. Petersburg advices to the effect that Russia will be
in no hurrv to strike the first decisive blow on land. Tokio's tacticians believe that these
statements are given out to "deceive the enemy," while forces are pushing jnto Korea
and strengthening their positions in Southern Manchuria. Whether Russia wills it or not, ac
cording to Japanese advices, there will be land fighting very soon.
The Vladivostok squadron is reported to have returned to that port, whence it will
not venture again until there is an improvement in weather conditions, the four cruisers hav
ing encountered a terrific gale at sea.
Chefu advices report that trains earning troops are arriving at Port Arthur every, ten
minutes, and that reinforcements are being "hurried forward to the Yalu River d^ily.
It develops that the three Japanese hanged, by Russians in Manchuria for attempting
to blow up a railroad bridge were officers of the general staff disguised as Chinese coolies.
Reports of further fighting at Port Arthur have been received in London and Berlin.
PORT ARTHUR TORPEDO FLOTILLA
POORLY HANDLED BY ITS CREWS
Decisive engagements are expected in North Korea >vithin a few days, although the
deep snow has made progress much slower than was at first expected. The fact that the Russians
are indulging in lugubrious manifestos and otherwise feigning monetary helplessness, instead of put
ting the Japanese off their guard and leading them into rash experiments, is moving them to added
caution.
CHEFU, Feb. 23. â Trains of twelve cars, each with eighty soldiers aboard, are now arriv
ing at Port Arthur every ten minutes. Reinforcements are being hurried forward to the Yalu from
the station at Laicheng. The railway administration has stationed two trains, each of eighteen
cars, at Dalny, to remove to the north the hospitals, officials and workmen should the Japanese bom
bard the city.
Mines have been laid at Dalny seventeen miles from the shore. . Neutral vessels which ar
rived after hostilities began experienced great difficulty in clearing from that port. Their, captains
were not allowed to have charge of the vessels until they had entirely passed the mines, naval offi
cers doing the piloting. A Chinese steamship which cleared last night from Dalny was subjected to
a severe search on her arrival.
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 23. â Non-combatants who are reaching Harbin from Vladivostok
report that the fortress town is under martial law. Food is scarce"and high; .business is suspended,
and the civilian element is leaving the city. Everybody fears a sudden attack by Japanese.
Fugitives say that the Vladivostok cruiser squadron returned to port after a terrible experi
ence in a snowstorm and gale. It is doubtful if it will venture to sea again until the weather has
permanently improved.
Further evidence is at hand that the Chinese National, or Pan-Mongolian, party is organiz
ing a formidable campaign against the Russians, dependent mainly -on the expected defeat of the
Muscovites in the coming military struggle. The chunchus, the daring organized robber bands from
Mongolia, are daily harassing and often attacking and beating Cossack railway guards. The ma
rauders are equipped with arms*, which prove their indebtedness to the Japanese. The Russian au
thorities are yi fear of and are preparing to cope with a possible rising of the Manchurian popu
lation due to the stimulus of the chunchus.

Germany Regards
War in Balkans
as Certain.
Large Order for
Rifles Placed by
Bulgaria.
BERLIN, Feb. 23.â The conviction of
the German Government that war be
tween Bulgaria and Turkey is within
measureable possibilities increases. The
war In the Far East, it is asserted, has
changed the temper of the Turks from
acquiescence in the reform plans of the
powers in Macedonia positive In
tractability. The Bulgarian Govern
ment four days after 'the outbreak of
the war placed an order with Loewe &
Co., the Mauser rifle and cartridge
makers, of Berlin, which order was
doubled Friday last. Loewe & Co., as
usual with the German arms makers,
notified the German Government.
The preparations for Emperor Wil
liam's- Mediterranean trip continue, and
it was said to-day that the Empress
was so much improved in health that
she probably would go with him. But
even now the threatening Balkan situ
ation may require the sovereign's pres-
ence in Berlin.
PARIS, Feb. 23.â As a result of rep
resentations made to the Porte during
the past few days, it is asserted that
Turkey, as well as the Balkan States,
recognizes the Austro-Russian reforms
as being in force, and will aid in their
execution. It is added that Turkey
and the Balkan States expressed their
appreciation of the fact that the Far
Eastern war did not modify the Bal
kan situation with regard to the con
cert of Europe. No friction txists, all
the powers being impressed with the
importance of acting together in order
to prevent war.
The Temps this afternoon publishes
a special dispatch from Belgrade,
which declares that the Albanian re
volt has not been exaggerated and by
no means is suppressed.
According to a review of the situa
tion made for the Temps by a corre
spondent at Sofia, Bulgaria desires
peace, but is prepared for war, tha
country having been turned into an
armed camp and warlike proclamations
having been issued to the army.
ROME, Feb. 23.â The situation in the
Balkans is considered here to have im
proved to-day from the fact, among
other things, that Turkey has ordered
seven torpedo-boat destroyers from'
Italian shipbuilders. It is believed she
would not do this if she thought se
rious trouble in the Balkans to be im-
minent.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Feb. 23.â M.
Natchivech, the Bulgarian agent here,
who has returned to his post, brought
back the formal assurance to the Porte
that the Sofia Government intended to
maintain an absolutely correct attitude
with regard to Macedonian affairs.
There is now a more conciliatory ten
dency in the Turkish official world to
ward the Bulgarian demands, and this
creates the hope that the relations be
tween the two countries will be Im-
proved,
GENOA, Feb. 23.â The United States
cruiser Brooklyn, with Rear Admiral
Cotton on board, left here to-day, going
in an easterly direction. She leaves un
der sealed orders, which are to be
cpened only when she is at sea.
BEXSOX'S IiAWYERS SCORE
SOME STRONG POINTS
Testimony of Clerk Harlan Is Decid
edly Favorable to the
Defendant.
NEW YORK, Feb. 23.â At to-day's
hearing of the charge against Benson,
Harlan, a clerk in the land division of
the Interior Department, uncier sharp
cross-examination by Attorney J. C.
Campbell, confessed that he had been
instructed by Secretary of the Interior
Hitchcock, acting in conjunction with
Secret Service Agent Burns, to send
Benson a letter offering him a confi
dential report of the department. Har
lan admitted that he did not have such
a report, but merely followed the verbal
instructions of his superiors. He tes
tified further that the work he per
formed for Benson was done after of
fice hours and he did not consider that
he was doing any wrong and that Ben
son at no time asked him to perform,
any wrongful act. /.*'.â  1

HIGHWAYMAN AUSTIN HOOPER MAKES CONFESSION IN WHICH HE AVERS
HE KNOWS ALL CONCERNING RECENT ROBBERY OF THE COLONIAL CLUB
Detectives Find Discrepancies in His Story
and Are Inclined to Doubt
Some of It.
Austin Hooper, the young highway
nan and former convict, who was ar
rested with Charles Carson, alias
"Shorty." last Sunday night at San
Anselmo. yesterday confessed partici
pation in a long list of robberies and
gave the authorities the names of sev
eral criminals he claims participated in
the "hold-up" of the Colonial Club in
this city on the night of February 12.
The latter part of the confession is
discredited by the San Francisco de
uttives. and they claim to have war
rant for their skepticism. Authentic
information from Petaluma is to the
effect that -soon after his release from
Han Quentin. on January 18, Hooper
returned to his home in that town and
r* mained at the home of his mother
until Monday. February 15, three days
after the Colonial Club was raided.
Detective Wren, who interviewed
Hooper yesterday in the Marin County
prison, says the story told by the youth
is inconsistent in several particulars.
So it may be that Hooper's statement
vas inspired bv puerile desire to glorify
himself in the opinion of the criminal
world. Or it might have found in
spiration in a yearning to be revenged
or, some of his companions in the Sau
salito robbery, whom he accuses of
having treated him unfairly.
The confession states that Hooper
and Carson were leagued in crime with
"English Dick." "San Jose Blackie,"
Kd Fahcy and a sixth man, whose
rame the authorities decline to divulge,
bt cause they believe they know where
he is. Hooper says that Carson was
not in the Colonial Club affair, as he
vas not released from San Quentin
until February 15.
INCONSISTENT STATEMENT.
According to Hooper's story he joined
the gang when he left prison on Janu
ary IS. and they all went to Los Ange
les. This conflicts with the report from
Petaluma. After working in Los An
pcles, he says,. they operated in Fresno,
Santa Barbara and other towns, finally
coming to San Francisco, where they
planned and executed the Colonial Club
hofd-up. Hooper said that he was to
have participated in the Colonial Club
n bbery that night, but when ques
tioned by Detective Wren on this point
he equivocated and contradicted him-
self.
There are notorious criminals known
as "English Dick" and "San Jose
J'lackie" and Ed Fahey, the latter hav
ing served time in San Quentin. But
if the San Francisco police know of
th^ir recent movements or present
whereabouts they are keeping their
knowledge to themselves. And the
Colonial Club officers paid that they
knew the men that robbed them, hinted
that the police were inactive in their
pursuit and finally put the case in the
hands of a private detective agency.
That was the last heard of one of the
boldest crimes on local record until
Hooper's confession restored it to pub
lic notice.
But that the incarceration of Hooper
and ("arson has not stopped the prac
tice of robbery in this city is shown by
the police records of yesterday, when
several arrests were made for that
crime. And none of the men arrested
were of the alleged gang, described by
Hooper. .
Th<> detective department seems to be
in the shadow so far as the identity
of "English Dick" is concerned. No
record of such an alias has been regis
tered in any of the prison books and
t.'iileFS some other name can be pro
diiced the police will have little to work
on. Fahey, however, is well known,
having made his escape from San
Quentin during July of last year with
several other desperate criminals. "Pan
Jr>se Blackie" is W. P. Vroman, who
started life 8!Â» a sailor, and who was
â J-rPFted in Yuba City for a safe-crack
ing job on May 5, 1901. Fortune fa
vorM "Blackie." and while his two
companions, Phillips and Johnson, went
to prison for fifteen years each, he
managed to <Â«<H-ure an acquittal. On
August 3. 1901, Vroman was heard of
again. He was arrested in San Jose
for petty larceny and served a sentence
of F ix months in the county jail there.
DISCREDIT THE COXFESSIOX.
Police of This City Disbelieve Some
of Hooper's Assertions. .'**â¢
Thus fa/ the police of this city have
given small heed to the San Rafael
matter. Durinp the afternoon Captain
of Detectives Martin ridiculed the idea
"f any confession Hooper might have
made in connection with the Colonial
riub hold-up, but during the evening
became more reticent and referred all
Questioners to Sergeant Detective Ed
WARNER'S REMEDIES.

â Wren, who assumed charge of the mat
ter early in the day. Martin at first
persisted that Hooper's statement was
false. He said that Wren, upon his re
turn from San Rafael, had told him
that Sheriff Taylor's prisoner was at
tempting to gain notoriety and that
while he believed him responsible for
the other crimes he admitted having
committed, it was hardly possible that
he had any connection with the club
robbery in San Francisco.
When Martin was asked if he would
make any effort to apprehend any of
the men Hooper implicated, he replied
that he would not.
"This fellow is only trying to get a
little more criminal fame for himself,"
said Martin, "and we do not propose
to let bats frighten us. Detective Wren
gave- me to understand when he re
turned from San Rafael this afternoon
that Hooper was lying, and I refer you
to him. One thing I do know, and
that is that Carson could not have been
there. He was not released from San
Quentin until February 15, and the
date of the Colonial Club robbery was
subsequent to that."
Detective Ed Wren discussed the
matter of his visit to San Rafael. The
sleuth says he went there for the pur
pose of interviewing both of the men
arrested for the Marin County robber
ies. Wren is emphatic, in his asser
tion that Hooper had nothing to do
with the Colonial Club hold-up, but he
admits that the man behind the bars
intimated that he knew all about it.
Wren says that after ; a severe cross
examination he called Hooper's atten
tion to many discrepancies in what he
offered as a statement.
"In the- first place," says Wren,
"Hc-oper' declared that he -was the cus
todian of the diamonds stolen from the
clubrooms. I asked him if he had been
engaged in the actual theft, and he
replied that he had not. After a few
moments' conversation the prisoner
mentioned 'San Jose Blackie,' 'English
Dick' and Fahey. Referring to him
self as a principal In the crime, when
he was a little off his guard I. asked
him who the fifth man was,' and he
answered that it might have been him
self. When I asked him to explain his
many contradictory assertions he re
fused to do so. and from that time I
branded him as a fabricator."
Wren further declares that the men
accredited with the club hold-up might
have been with Hooper in his series
of other crimes, but their whereabouts
Is very uncertain at the present time,
and if the statement of Captain of
Detective Martin be true there will be
little effort made to take them into
custody.
Martin is of the opinion that the Co
lonial Club was entered and robbed by
men that were closer connected with
it thary the ex-convicts whose names
come from Marin County. Though no
arrests have been made nor clews se
cured, the idea of a confession on the
part of a daring criminal seems to bs
scoffed at, and, as Wren puts it, un
less Martin so orders him he will not
try to catch the three other men.
HOW THIEVES WORKED.
Hooper Tells of Incidents Relating to
His Last Crime.
This is a verbatim copy of the con
fession made by Austin Hooper yes
terday to the Marin County authorities
concerning his participation in the
crime for which he was arrested:
My name is Austin Hooper, and I reside In
Petaluma. There were four of us engaged in
this robbery â English Dick, from Seattle;' a
man named Blackie, Shorty and myself. Last
Friday I met English Dick in the Everything
for a Penny Place on Market street. He told
me he knew a place in Sausalito where there
was a game running, and that we could get,
I think. $8000 or $10,000. I agreed to meet
him at the ferry and take the 10:20 boat. I
met him there with Shorty and Blackie. At
Sausalito Dick told Shorty and me to ride as
far as San Anselmo and walk back to i=au-

salito. which we did. When we not as far as
a high turntable at Sausalito Shorty and I
met San Jope P.lackie anJ Knglish Dick. Then
they took the clothes thoy had in a bauket and
made me change. I had on a sweater, Uut
no mask. Ulackie. .cut . oft part of my pants
leg to make a mask for me. Dick and Blackie
showed us the place. Blaekio Btood at the lum
ber pile and Dick stood down the street, op
posite a livery stable. Shorty went Into the
saloon first and I followed. After we got all
we could find and left the saloon we found
Dick and Blackie right outside. They -went
up a hill road Into the residence part, and we
followed to where they stopped. Then' I put on
my decent clothes igain and threw- the others
over a bridge. They didn't change their?.
They walked down to a landing; we followed,
and Dick took a boat and went to* a launch.
He wanted me to run it aa I had made a study
of gasoline engines in the prison. I told them
the launch didn't have any steering gear, and
that there was no oil in the tank. We then
left the launch and Dick and Blackie went in
the small boat to beneath the ferry landing,
where I think. ' they threw their clothes away.
When I mi't them again they told me to get
a room,, which 1 did. At (i the next morning
we took the boat for San Francisco. The
other three went over on the same boat, but
none of uÂ« spoke; we all kept apart. At the
ferry in San Francisco Dick and I got on the
car together and got off at Kcarny street.
.Blackle took the 7:30 boat from San-Fran
cisco for Petaluma. We all planned, to go .to
Pctaluma Saturday night to rob the s=ho<Â» fac
tory. We expected that the men would ' -fee
paid that night between $500 and $700. 'â¢'
I met Dick at thÂ«* ferry again about hajf
past 10. Came over alone on the 11 o'clock
boat to San Rafael. Shorty and Dick came
over on the next. My Instructions were . to
hire a livery rig and meet them on the road
for Petaluma. I got the rig In San Rafael;
met them about two from the stable
and drove the two of them to Petaluma. At
Novato we tried to get another horse, but
could not. Near Petaluma. at the draw
bridge, Dick cot out and walked the reÂ«t of
the way. Shorty and I drove up to D street.
In town we met Iilackle and DlcU. We went
to the factory. Dick stood on one corner.
Blackle on the other; I stayed in the rig and
Shorty went Into the factory. He was to
hold up the cl^rk and get the money. Dick
and Blackie had their weapons drawn. Shorty
returned and Raid: "There is no money; the
men are not being paid off."
We then went to Sonoma, expecting to . be
able to rob a saloon that had three nickel-In
the slot machines full of money. On the road we
stopped at the saloon, but got no opportunity
to commit the robbery. At Sonoma Shorty
put the horse and rig up. I went to bed. '
Sunday morning, at half -past 7, we started
to walk for San Rafael. Dick and Blackle
kept about a mile ahead all the time. Shorty
and I arrived in San Rafael about 10 D. - m.
About ten blocks north of the brcad-gaupe 'de
pot we met Blackle and Dick. We then
agreed to go to San Francisco, Dick and
Blackle by the electric road. Shorty and I by
the steam road. Dick and Blackle left us for
the electric railroad, i Shorty went to the
broadgauge depot to buy a ticket and then
found out that no morÂ«* trains left for San
Francisco that night. When Shorty was com
ing back I noticed a man following him al
most alongside. 1 started to walk and kept in
the shade. I turned the corner In the shadow.
As I did so, I heard the strange fellow say:
"Is that you, partner?" Then I started, to
run. The fellow called me to come back. I
ran as hard as I could and the first thins I
knew I heard three or four ' shots and said,
"That fellow Is shooting at me." I ran about
a block and turned around and Shorty Joined
me and said he had lest his hat In a scuffle
with this fellow. We circulated around back
of the Hotel Pw&fael, down , the <- road â  that
crosses the creek to the electrle road; waited
up th<> track to the depot and again met Dick
and Blackie.- Thoy told us they knew of a sa
loon at the outskirts of the town, that <Ii<l* *
good deal of business and that the proprietor
wcmld scare easily and that we could get his
money. We then . agreed to rob the saloon.
We got to Shannon's place, passed the door
and went beyond the light cast by the lamp.
Shorty went Inside and I stood right across
the street, alongfide of Dick. We heard
Shorty keep telling a fellow to put up his
hands. Dick told me I had better go ' In, and I
went over and looked in the door. Dick had
given me two guns. - They never let me carry
the guns, and I went and helped Shorty. You
know what happened in there
After we left we all started for San An
eelmo. On the way we mw a fellow coming
with a bicycle and we jumped the fence and
ran^over a plowed, field. We got about a
hundred feet and then stopped to talk. Dick
and Blackie wanted us two to make another
attempt in Sausalito, as we had robbed the

here; and the others said: "What Is the
matter with you?. Tou want some money." I
said I didn't want any money; I was tired
and disgusted; I wanted to go home and be
decent ;. and â  Blaekie said. "No, I â  will be
if you go home." I started to run from
them. Jumped over the fence, commenced to
run up and climb the hill. 1 couid hear them
following. â¢ I fell. Blackie and Dick were
close behind. Shorty was shouting: "Cut it
out. Don"t hurt the kid. Let him go."
As I went to get up. I think, it was Dick
got hold of my hand as I lay on the ground,
and Blackie then threw his arm around my
neck, and then 1 struck out at Blackie, and
then one of the others ehot. The bullet struck
me in the leg, here (showing. place), then Dick
and Blackie ran down the hill and disap
peared. Shorty stayed there and helped me
bind up the wound. The rest you know.
English Dick is one of the hardest crooks
In the- United States. He Is an expert pistol
shot and carries these German automatic re
volvers. He knows the efficiency of every po
lice officer and Sheriff in the country; knows
the distance between every town and all th*
means of travel. He has. plenty of money,
Showing us as much as $500. He if> an expert
prizefighter I and la muscular. â¢ I believe ho
and some others are implicated In the Turk
street robbery. '
At a late hour last night Hooper
made the following -additional state
ment to a representative of The Call:
Now, let me tell you â don't be steered off by
any so-called confession I made to having been
In the Colonial Club hold-up. I might have
been and might not have been. If I had been
there In time, but It just happened that I was
not there and can prove an alibi. It don't
make any difference to me one way or the
other what you nay. My so-called confession
Is all right except the Colonial Club trick.
Carson of course, could not have been there,
as he. only got but of prison las. t week. An
other thing you will noticeâ I never signed
that confession. I don't mind telling evenT>
of the past week. I am up against It, any
way, and will probably do life, but don't ever
think I will plead guilty. I will give them a
ru-n for their money. Further, In regard to
the Colonial Club: I know about It and don't
mind Baying that Blackie and English Dick
â were there. Fahey was in on It. too, but
neither the "Kid" (Carson) nor I was there
at all. , ,
Detectlv? Wren was hore to-day and tried to
implicate me In the Colonial. Of course he
did not tell me his correct name. Said he was
Mr. Brown, a member of the club. That was
all right. When a . man thinks he is wise,
don't disturb hia thoughts. I recognized him
.just as soon as he came in the cell.
That is part of thlÂ» business, never to forget
faces and be acquainted with all of the offl-'
cere. I knew Sheriff Taylor well. I used to
attend Mount Tamalpals Military Academy
and. met him then. Why the other night he
drove by Shorty and me. He was In a buggy
and had a shotgun. I could have picked him
then dead easy, but murder Is not in m*. al
though I take no chances. A fellow in this
business has to be prepared to do anything,
and kill if necessary. I : knew Taylor was
after us and would kill us, but I let him pass.
I -. have good parents and ; have tried many
times to-be decent, but. I guess it's the ex
citement that kept me In the business. There
was good money In it. too. .33Â£Â£33jÂ§$Â£gK|
! ' Carson substantiated* Hooper's* ver
sion of the gang's . operations. He
stated that when Hughes called to him
/N the Marin County Prison young 'Austin Hooper, who was arrested at San Anselmo last
Sunday for the burglary of a saloon at Sausalito, is making confessions that arc so at van
ance with one another as to bring, discredit upon them from the detectives of San Francisco.
He staled that he participated tn the recent hold-up of the Colonial Club in this city, but zvhen
questioned by Detective Wren tie contradicted himself so flagrantly iJ.at the officer disbelieved
his entire story. At a late hour last night the young criminal sent for a Call representative and
said he ivas not directly implicated in the Colonial Club affair, but knew the men who did the
work and voluntarily gave their names. As they are the men who, he says, shot and othenvise
abused him Sunday night, it is logically inferred by the police that his narrative of accusation
was actuated b\ a desire to avenge his wrongs by having them arrested. Hooper's original as
severation that Ije was one of the five masked men that "held up" the Pozvell-street clubhouse
was weakened by The Call's discovery that at the time of that desperate crime he zixjs residing
at the home of his mother in Petaluma.
Sunday night he thought he was after
them, and took no chances. He said
her shot to kill, and titought he got his
man, as he saw him fall against the
fence. He then ran. Carson left San
Quentin on February 15, after doing
time for assault with a deadly weapon^
He is an old pal of English Dick, and
came west with him. Carson and Dick
made several hold-ups in Denver, Salt
Lake and Seattle. He met Hooper in
San Quer.tin and there their friendship
originated. Carson told Hooper of the
sang, heJsays, and when the "Kid" left
prison in January he Immediately
joined them in Los Angeles. This con
flicts with Hooper's 1 narrative.
HOOPER ROBBED HIS MOTHER.
PETALUMA, Feb. 23.â Austin Hoop
er came here soon after his release
from San Quentin on January 18 and
remained at his mother's home until a
week ago , yesterday, when he started
for San Francisco. After his departure
from the residence, his mother discov
ered that he- had taken her watch and
a diamond ring belonging to his sister.
The police were notified and they
caught the young desperado at the
railroad station awaiting the south
bound train. They found the watch
on his person, but the ring was art
fully concealed in the handle of a re
volver which he carried' in his valise
and he got away with it. His rela
tives were too pleased to get him out
of town to insist on his arrest.
A brother of Hooper visited San
Francisco a few days later and met
Austin, who told him that while jour
neying to that city he had fallen in
with several ex-convicts v from San
Quentin, with whom he finished the
trip and had "a high old time." He
bought lots of drinks for them, he said,
and treated them to dinner. He boast
ed to his brother that he had held up
a woman 'in San Francisco and got
quite a nice booty. ,The brother was
sufficiently interested in the story to
investigate It further, and found that
on the date mentioned a woman had
been waylaid and robbed, just as Aus
tin had' stated.
BOxVRDER SHOOTS BURGLAR.
Two burglars who broke into the
residence of Mrs. Lola Joakin, 341 Jessie
street, about. A o'clock yesterday morn
ing were captured after a desperate
struggle and one of them was shot in
the arm by James McMahon, a roomer
in the house. They are Joseph M. Wal
lace, 33 years of age, and George Lang,
18 years of age.
McMahon, who occupies a front
room, was awakened by the - nc-ise of
hi3 window being opened. He saw Wal
lace as he was stepping into the room
and asked him what he wanted. Wal
lace replied that he wanted his money.
"All right," said as he
jumped out of bed, "here's my clothes,
and I'll go into the other room and
get some more money from the old
\v e-man."
McMahon knew there was a shotgun
in a room occupied by Mr. and Mrs.
Eugene Wright and he hurried into
their room. He told them there were
thieves in the bouse and he wanted the\
gun. Unfortunately, there were no car
tridges in the house, but McMahon was
not to be balked. Clad in his pajamas,
he ran out of the rear door and along
Jessie street to a saloon on the corner
of Fifth street. He asked the barten
der if he had any cartridges and was
fortunate in getting two. He told the
bartender to blow his police whisfte
and ran back to the house.
â¢Policeman H". Wilson met McMahon,
who told the officer to watch the front
door, while he entered by the rear. As
McMahon entered the house he saw
Wallace coming from the dining-room
into the kitchen. Wallace raised his
revolver and McMahon Tespondcd by.
raising the shotgun and firing. Wal
lace threw his left, arm over his face
to protect It and received the charge
in the forearm. Wallace turned and

and $3 in coin. The watch was found
on the street, where it had been thrown
by either Wallace or Lang.
"BABE" CURTIX ARRESTED.
Anthony Curtin, alias "Babe." was
arrested at an early hour yesterday
morning by Detectives Taylor and Mul
cahey and locked up in "the tanks" at
the City Prison. He was out on 52000
bonds, awaiting his trial on a charge
of burglary in Judge Cook's court thia
morning.
The police have suspected that Cur
tin was implicated in the holdups in
saloons throughout the city, and par
ticularly the one at Thomas D. Mur
phy's liquor store at Tenth and Mission
streets a week ago last Monday night,
when the bartender was shot. Captain
Martin detailed Detective Taylor to
shadow Curtin, who had a companion
named "Dummy." For four nights
Taylor had been shadowing Curtin,
and from information he received hÂ«
was satisiled the suspect intended to
hold up the bartender in Neill & Simp
son's saloon at Seventh and Mission
streets about 3 o'clock yesterday morn
1ns.
Curtin had been in the saloon of
Meyer Cohn at Seventh and Market
streets on Sunday night, and the bar
tender saw him secrete a revolver in
side the top of hia trousers. He left
there, accompanied by his companion,
and went to Neill & Simpson's saloon
about 11 o'clock. The time was evi
dently not ripe for holding up the bar
tender, and Curtin and his companion
left. Taylor had been notified by
Cnhn'a bartender about Curtin and the
revolver and that Curtin and his com
panion had gone to Neill & Simpson's,
but while Taylor was telephoning to
police headquarters for Mulcahey. Cur-
tin and his companion left the saloon.
About 2 o'clock yesterday morning
â¢ Curtin, with hfs companion, dropped
I into Cohn's saloon, and something
j ma.de Curtin suspicious. He ran out
of the saloon and up Jones street, pur
sued by Taylor and Mulcahey. He
dropped a handkerchief in his flight,
which the officers picked >aip. Curtin
turned into Turk street toward Market
and Mulcahey ran down Golden Gate
avenue to head him off, while Taylor
kept up the pursuit. He was captured
by the two officers on Turk street, near
Mason. When searched two string3
could be used for tying a hand
j kerchief over his face and a revolver
were found in his pockets. He re
marked that he was sorry he did not
let Taylor "have it," meaning:, that offi
cer thinks?' that he did not shoot him.
The "Dummy" made his escape.
The crime for which Curtin will be
tried in Judge CooVs court this morn-
Ing is for entering the grocery and sa
loon of TV. G. Schroedcr, 923 Mission
street, on March 28 and attempting to
blow open the safe. He was accom
panied by Clarence Franklin, who has
been tried and convicted, but not yet
sentenced. At that time Curtin fired
a shot at Special Officer Maloney.SENATE RATIFIES THE PANAMA CANAL
TREATY AFTER REJECTING AMENDMENTS
Continued From Page 1, Column 7.
Standing the fact that the interests cf
Georgia called for the ratification of
the treaty the people of the State did
not approve recent occurrences on the
Isthmus. After stating his position
Bacon spoke of his amendment to the
treaty looking to a peaceful settlement
of all difficulties" between i.h<? United
States and Colombia by paying a sum
of money to Colombia in full compen
sation for the surrender and quitclaim
of all right of sovereignty over the ter
ritory embraced in the republic of Pan
ama.
Brrry of Arkansas said that if he
b'-iieved the defeat of the treaty would
restore Colombia's sovereignty over
Panama he would vote against the con
vention, but, he declared, the defeat of
the treaty would be unavailing in that
respect.
The p<vple of the South wanted the
canal, and therefore he thought it the
duty of the representatives of the
Booth to vote for the treaty.
Teller of Colorado said that the pres
ent conditimi of the finances of this |
Government vould not permit of the
taking of money from the treasury to
buiM the canal, and it would be neces
sary to borrow the money, and no one
knoTCs how great v.-nuld be the loan
we must negotiate. The expenditures j
by the French people of ?250,OOO,0OO. he
paid, built cr.ly about one-quarter of the
canal. Of the 540,000,000 which this
Government was nominally to pay for
the property, he said, he believed $20,-
OOtZfiOO wap for the canal and the other
S20.O00.O00 would go to the lobbyists who j
had put the deal through.

j ready for a revolution and he did not
believe the United States officials con
nived nt.it.. He refuted /the charges
that this Government could be made
to account for what had taken place
on the isthmus.
"I think the worst thing the United
j States has done," Simmons said, "has
been to maintain Colombian tyranny
on the isthmus for the last fifty years.
"The question of whether the Presi
dent did right or wrong on the isthmus
is not now before the Senate.
"The only thing to be considered is
I whether the treaty is a meritorious one.
All of those other questions may, and
I hope they will, receive further con
sideration."
The Senate then went into executive
session.
The amendments which were offered
by the Committee on Foreign Relations
and afterward withdrawn were again
offered and voted down. The Bacon
amendment, providing for a treaty
with Colombia, with a view to satisfy
ing any future demands of that
country on account of the secession of
Panama, also was rejected by the Sen
ate.
After voting down the amendments
offered Senator Morgan of Alabama

to the treaty in its present form.

NAVAL APPROPRIATION BILL.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 23. â Although
the House, devoted the entire day to
consideration of the naval appropria
tion bill under the five-minute rule,
smaU progress was made. Amendments
â were offered in profusion for the per
fection of the measure from a Demo
cratic standpoint, but all save an ap

The fight over the proposed Great

THE SAN FRANCISCO GALL.' WEDNESDAY, -FEBRUARY "24, 1904.
Bill Is Introduced to
Govern Canal
Territory.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 23.â Senator
Kittredge of South Dakota, a member
of the Interoceanic Canal Committee,
after the ratification of the canal treaty
to-day introduced a bill to provide for
temporary government of the Panama
canal territory and the protection of
I the canal works and for other purposes
'connected with construction of the]
canal.
The first section creates "the Panama
board of governors," consisting of three
citizens of the United States, not all of j
whom shall be of the same political j
party, to be appointed by the Presi- j
dent and confirmed by the Senate. !
Until Congress shall otherwise pro- |
Tide, according to the second section, !
the legislative, executive and admin-!
istrative powers possessed by Congress !
and the privileges of the United States :
on the isthmus of Panama shall be â 
vested in the board of governors. The i
powers so j vested shall include the
pewer to raise revenue.
Senator Kittredge say's some modifi
cation of the provision for the board of
governors may be necessary when th-i
duties of the Isthmian CanarCommls
sion shall have been determined. If
the commission is to have charge of
the work o^ construction and is to be
sometimes on the isthmus and some
times in the United States the board
will be necessary, but in case it shall
be determined that a sufficient num
ber of commissioners shall be residents
of the canal strip to constitute a gov
ernment the board of governors may be
dispensed with and the duties of the
board devolve upon the commission.
Section 3 contains the bill of rights
of the United States constitution, with
some additional restrictions which pro
vide that all moneys collected for a
special purpose shall be treated ' as a
special fund and paid out only for such
purposes; that the laws of the United
States, except such aa are expressly
made applicable to the territory, shall
not extend to the territory; that goods
not the product or manufacture of the
territory coming to the United States
shail pay the same duties as goods from
foreign ports; that the laws in force
in the republic of Panama on the date
of exchange of ratifications for the

THE DECISION
Action of United States Su
preme Court on Northern Se
curities Anxiously LookedFor
HILL HAS A XEW PLAN
President's^"' Friends Declare
That Under Xo Circumstances
Will the Control Be Changed
NEW YORK, Feb. 23.â While bankers
here do not generally believe that the
United States Supreme Court will ren
der its decision in. the Northern Securi
ties case immediately upon .the-recon
vening after its brief vacation, the near
approach of that event is causing much
discussion in financial circles. 7
J. J. Hill, president of the securities
company, has been actively engaged of
late in conferring with , the. various
bankers interested â¢ and it is now said
a tentative plan* has been agreed upon
for use in case the" Supreme Court de
cides adversely tor the company. Hill
has refused to discuss, the subject in
any way, but one of the bankers as
sociated in the enterprise is quoted as
follows
"WÂ£ do not in the slightest fear for
the fate of the Northern Securities
Company, no matter what the findings
of the Supreme Court. The two prop
erties, the Great Northern and the
Northern Pacific roads, will in no event
pass out of the hands which now con
trol them. How; this end will be
achieved I am not at liberty. to state,
but- it will be accomplished,' neverthe
less. If the Supreme Court; finds the
present manner, of holding the securi
ties of the two roads to be illegal it
will indicate what shall constitute a
legal manner of holding them and that
manner of retaining them will be pur-
sued. *
"If the decree of 7th e lower court
should be "affirmed. In all particulars
there would be trouble to some other
roads, but not so much to the "Northern
Securities Company, which has been
preparing to meet the outcome."
In a general way it is understood
that in the event of an adverse decision
and a swee:i!ng decree the: Northern
Securities Company will turn over thÂ»
control of the Northern Pacific stock to
other interests, either to a railroad cor
poration in- no way associated with the
merger roads or to a voting trustee
ship. The joint guarantee of the Bur
lington bonds by the Great Northern
and Northern Pacific will not be dis
turbed. It is presumed that this plan
contemplates the reduction of Northern
Securities stock by the equivalent of
the amount issued for Northern Pacilic
stock.

INVOKES LAW
TO FIND BEAR
Captain J. T. C. Nash Awakes
to Find His Gilded Orna
ments Gone From Pedestal
SECURES SEARCH WARRANT
c
Blames the Theft on Univer
sity Students and Declares
He Will Defy Yellow Signs
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center street, Feb. 23.
Somebody has goV Captain J. T. C.
N'ash's gilded bear and the captain
has appealed -to the law to help him
get it back. He lays the blame for
the theft upon the fraternity students
of the University of California and to
day he got a search warrant in Justice
Edgar's court, with which instrument
of justice he proposes to inspect every
fraternity house in Berkeley in the
hope of recovering: the ornament.
Captain Nash occupies the -house at
Cedar street and Lookout place. It
was once the home of Paris Kilburn.
the former harbor commissioner, and
the pilded bear was one of the first
pigrhts that met the gaze of the visitor
upon entering the handsome grounds.
The bear is a California grizzly that
was Riven to Mr. Kilburn and he
prized it so highly that he intended to
take it to his home in San Francisco
when he moved away recently. j
But when Captain Nash looked out
of his front window this mornin^ he
discovered that the prized art work
was pone from its pedestal above the
gateway. The captain could not be
lieve that the bear had walked off of
his own accord, so he investigated.
The inspection convinced Captain
Nash that Mr. Pear had passed in the
night with a band of head-hunting stu
dents. A chain that hung around the
animal's neck was broken off, and the
wooden pegs that kept him steady
against the elements were sawed off
dose to the paws. This evident dese
cration of his ground enraged Captain
Nash and he hurried off to the Justice's
court to get a search warrant.
"1 intend to search every fraternity
house in Berkeley," said Captain Nash.
"I think the bear was coaxed off by
students in search of ornaments for
their places. They teil me that a num
ber of the fraternity houses have put
'smallpox* and "diphtheria' contagion
signs from the health office in front
of their doors, but they w'ill not scare
me off. That bear is too valuable to
be given up so easily."
Captain Nash will ask the police to
help him in his search.

THE ASYLUMS
Board of Supervisors Is Noti
fied That the County Must
Care for Harmless Lunatics
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Feb. 23.
The Board of Supervisors was noti
fied to-day by John W. Stetson, attor
ney for the California State Lunacy
Commission, that two harmless luna
tics were to be returned to them from
Agnew Asylum, and that the State in
tends to put in force a law passed by
the last Legislature providing for the
return of persons hot properly subjects
of the State asylums to. the several
counties whence they came.
Many harmless indigents have been
consigned to the State asylums within
the last few years, whose proper homes
should be the county poor farms. Such
cases are to be weeded out of the asy
lums to make room for persons dan
gerous to t"he community.
Mr. Stetson stated to-day that this
was the first move made to reduce the
number of inmates in the State asy
lums and that other counties would be
served with similar notices later.
EVENTS IN SOCIETY

ized and that there gold would' be' found In
aLundance. His prophecy was fulfilled, but
not for many years later.
Miss Geraldlne Bcupham's paper on the Pius
Fund was excellent. Mrs. Crane followed with
a jxiDer on the Franciscan FTiars. and Mrs.
Krances H. Gray told of "The Missions." Mrs.
â William Helm cloeed the afternoon's pro

SLICE OF ISLE OF MAN WOULD
HEAL A WOUNDED HEART
Leona Bonne Sues William Lucien Drinkwater Garey for
Breach of Promise, the Defendant's Interest in Little
Land Off England's Coast Lends a Smack of Romance
OAKLAND, Feb. 23.â William Lucien
Drinkwater Carey of Beach House,
Castleton, Isle of Man, which lies near
the coast of England, has traveled sev
eral timps around the world, lived in
every clime to be found on the globe
and has established temporary abode
In half of the lands upon this earth,
only to be served with a $100,000 breach
of promise suit in the quiet and peace
ful city of Oakland. The suit was filed
In the Superior Court of this county
late this afternoon, it being brought in
the name of Leona Bonne, who does a
"Hying trapeze" act in Chicago theaters
that need that particular kind of at
traction.
It is true that $100,000 is a rather
fancy figure to place upon broken
promises and injured affections, but
Leona Bonne insists that- damages
should be awarded in proportion to the
amount possessed by the defendant,
and so she specifies in her complaint
that William Lucien Drinkwater Carey
is possessed of large estates and is
worth at least $250,000, with further
prospects, including a part if not the
whole of the Isle of Man.
In this high-priced document Leona
Bonne further declares that Mr. Carey
is the son of Colonel Henry Carey of
the British army, who served with
honor and distinction through the
Crimean war. and that the colonel's es
tate is large- and valuable.
The alleged broken promise of mar
riage was given in 1901 in the windy
city of Chicago, where the trapeze
artist still resides, and after tearful,
broken-hearted, but mature and math
ematical consideration she has come to
the conclusion that a $100,000 s\ice out
of that Isle of Man estate would be
about the proper balm for all the agony
she has suffered from the fact that Mr.
Carey now has another wife, who is
living peacefully with him in his Oak
land home.
SUED OXCK BEFORE.
Miss Leona -Bonne neglects to men
tion in her complaint that she once be
fore sued Mr. Carey for breach of
promise, at that time putting the sum
of her damage at $50,000. and Mr. Carey
says that he wonders if the price of her
affections will increase with the years
at that ratio and upset the theory that
time he^ils all wounds.
Miss Leona Bonne is still in Chicago
doing her trapeze act in order to keep
warm amid the blizzards of the Windy
City, so that she is not able to tell her
own story, but* between thfe complaint
in the case and her attorney, F. J. Rus
sell of this city, a little of her elevated
romance can be secured.
According to her . complaint, Miss
Bonne met Mr. Carey in Chicago in
1900 She was performing befo-re count
less thousands at a Chicago theater,
and out of those thousands (fame Wil
liam Lucien Drinkwater Carey to tell
her of a love that burned fiercer and
more deeply than the. usual Chicago,
practical, workaday love. They were
much together, she says, during which
times he told, her of the island that
he owned or was going to own and
wanted her to share the sea-kissed land
with him and take all of his love. She
thought the combination a good one
and accepted, and then, she claims.
Carey went to the island" to prepare
it for her coming." Somehow the love
got tangled on the - way, for Carey
married, and drifting "back to Oakland,
settled down.
It is true that the Carey story only
agrees with this torrid Chicago state
ment in the mere dates. Carey an
nounces that* he met Miss Bonne in
Chicago when she was "broke"; that
he helped her out of her trouble out
of mere sympathy, and then left her
to continue his journey to his old home,
where he was married.
PRODUCES LETTERS.
Miss Bonne would support her state
ments by copies of a number of letters
Bent to her attorney which she claims
were written by Carey to her. One
was written on board ship and appar
ently was mailed at Queenstown. It
begins with "My Dear Leona," and tells
of the writer's sickness and how lonely
he had been at leaving her. , He and
a friend had been singing "Bring Back
My 'Bonne* to Me"â a touching - play
upon her name. The letter was writ
ten In February and the writer said
that he would see her again in July..
The next letter was a business let-
WEALTHY ENGLISHMAN
WHO IS DEFENDANT IN
BREACH OF PROMISE SUIT.
tor, in which the â¢ writer tells her that
he had paid hi* former wife, from
whom he had neÂ£n divorced, $1000 due
on alimony, and^ that as soon as he
paid her $3000 more he would be clear
of her.
A third letter is written from Beach
House, Castleton, Isle of Man, Ens
land. In it the writer says he has
been singing, "Bring Back My -Bon
nie" ag'ain. But "absence makes the
heart grrow fonder," he writes, and he
will 'soon see her again.
Then a cloud appears on their hori
zon, for in the next letter the writer
states he has received a "horrid" let
ter from her, and any one that had
mentioned Ada Conger to her only
did it to make trouble. He assures
her there is nothing in it all and
wants her to write him n nice letter.
Ada Consrer is now Mrs. William L.
D. Carey.
There is plenty of sentiment but no
talk of marriage in the letters. Miss
Bonne, however, has assured her at
torney that she can show by the pro
prietor of the St. Charles Hotel In
Chicago and other witnesses that he
said he would marry her.
PROVES A GOOD FELLOW.
William Lucien Drinkwater Carey
came to Oakland during the year just
past and rented a handsome house at
477 Thirty-fourth street. He soon
proved himself a good fellow about
town, for he hnd traveled around the
world and had the ease and polish of
a man that had been in many places
and seen much. â¢ He had many good
stories to tell of his travels, and he
told them modestly.
He occasionally mentioned his owner
ship of "an island off the coast of Eng
land," but he did not boast that it
was the Isle of Man, nor did he claim
fortunes nor estate across seas.
In fact, he seemed more American than
English, and when he- heard' of Leona
Bonne's suit he swore some good round
American "swear words" that were not
imported and had never paid duty. Mr.
Carey's statement is as follows:
. "This is merely a blackmailing
scheme, but it won't work with me.
This is not the first time that this
woman has tried to make trouble for
me, for only a 'few months after my
marriage, three years ago, she began
a suit for breach of promise. I paid
no attention to It, and I suppose that
it was'simply allowed to lapse. At that
time. Miss Bonne valued her wounded
affections at $50,000, and I suppose if
the matter runs along for another three
years she will raise the amount to
$150,000, increasing it $50,000 for every
three years. At that rate, before I
pay her a cent the total will be a large
one.
"The truth of the matter is that I
met this woman when she was out of
work and penniless and, pitying her
condition, I paid, a bill that! she owed
at the hotel and paid her board for sev
eral weeks until she could get work.
This is a fact the proprietor of the
hotel she mentions can testify to."

MAKES A PLEA
FOR THE CHILD
Judge Lindsey, Notable in the
Juvenile Court Work, De
livers a Strong Address
EXPLAINS NEW METHODS
Tells a Story of Effort to
Check the Tremendous In
crease in Young: Criminals
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway. Feb. 23.
City and county officials, the judi
ciary of Alameda County and of Oak
land, Police Department officials and
several hundred members of the
School Department heard Judge Ben
B. Lindsey of Denver this afternoon
in an eloquent and illuminating ad
dress on the work in Colorado of '"The
Juvenile Court and Its Results." The
meeting was held at the Common
School Assembly Hall in Lafayette
Square and was under the direction
of the Associated Charities of Oakland.
Judge Lindsey was the guest of B. H.
Pendleton, City Councilman and
president of that organization.
Superior Judge Samuel P. Hall, pre
siding over the Juvenile Court in Ala
meda County, opened the meeting in a
brief address, saying:
The familiar adage. "An ounce of prevention
13 worth a pound of cure," appeals in its
truth to sense and reason. The principle has
been embodied In the law ofÂ»this State . by
which the . Juvenile courts have been estab
lished to prevent the youth from becomin*
crimintilts. The friends of the law and of our
youth have the greatest hope In its adminis
tration. We feel much encouraged after a
year of operation in California. It seems
to be the way to control the wayward youth.
We hope* that under the beneficent operation
of this law that we shall be able to reduce
the very larte percentage of crime among the
youth,.
Amons people who have followed this work
it Ir aerced that under Judtre Ltndsev's ad
ministration of the Juvenile Court he has
accomplished eminently successful results.
WELCOME BY MAYOR.
Mayor Warren Olney was presented
and gave welcome to the visitor. The
Mayor said:
In giving welcome to Judge Lindsey on be
half of cur city I desire to say that he will
speak to us on the most important subject
before the people to-fiay that relates to so
ciological improvement. Really and truly we
recognize the hopelessness of the adult crimi
nal. 1 take it that every one who has reached
years t>f experience and wisdom realizes that
you must besln with the children if you de
sire to make a civilized community. It is
of no use to attempt to reform the adult crim
inal 1 . You must bertn with the child, and
thus.'' you prevent the adult criminal. I am
particularly glad to sÂ« so many schoolteachers
here. They supplement the work of goo<l
mothers with the ch^lld and often do the work
for the child when it Is not done in the home.
Mayor Olney introduced Judge Lind
sey as one who would say something
to encourage others to do their duty
as good citizens in this important field.
At the outset- Judge Lindsey de
clared that the subject of youth hand
ling was close to the home, to the
hearts of fathers and mothers, and
should be close to the heart of every
good citizen. He quoted from Presi
dent Roosevelt's speeches declaring
that the future of the nation depend
ed upon the children and said the
President put the problem of their
rearing at the top of all. He added:
The children present the most important
problem, for the problem of the child is the
problem of the State. I am afraid we are
prone to neglect this important proposition.
Now the home makes the neighborhood, the
neighborhood makes the cities and cities make
the State. If there be complaints about the
rebellion of the boy against the law it is
no reflection on the boy, but it is a reflection
on the parents, the adults, on the State, if it
Is a reflection on anybody. The children in
the cities to-day cecelve less care than first
class livestock. ; That's a strong statement,
but we have got to put it strongly if we want
to wake up the people.
STATE AT FAULT.
Judge Lindsey declared that the
trouble with the child, that which
starts him toward criminality, must
be corrected by the State, by the Judge
on the bench and the officers of the
law.
"But you can't make a rule for
adults," he said, "that will control
children. Yet that is what the State
has been doing for hundreds of years."
Judge Lindsey quoted freely from
records of Eastern cities showing the
alarming increase in crime among the
youth. He discussed the relations of
the State and of parents, to the prob
lem and asked:
What about the shameful, criminal, carelesa
State? The State must meet this problem of
the child delinquent as a wise and lovins
parent. Now as to the Ju -enile Court, the
theory is -not how many does our system cor
rect, but does it correct more than the old
system does? This court is an effort by the
Btate to deal more intelligently with the prob
lem. It is to correct rather than to punish
In this work we must have the co-operation
of the parents and the schoolteachers. It
will be a miserable failure unless we wake
up from the Judge on the bench down through
the police to the parent.
Judge Lindsey enlivened his address
with much anecdote of his experiences
i with wayward youth and of the success
: in method, j He denounced the police
and criminal court operations as man
ufacturing criminals. In the end he
appealed for intelligent and earnest
co-operation of teachers, citizens and
officers of the law to advance the
plans for better control of the way
ward young.
After the address Judge Lindsey
was the guest at an informal recep
tion at the Nile Club. This evening
he dined with President Pendleton of
the Associated Charities, Miss C.
Anita Whitney, probation officer of
the Juvenile Court, and others who
are interested in the operation of the
law in this county.
Grand Jury Meets.
OAKLAND, Feb. 23.â The Grand
Jury was in session this morning and
had under consideration the matter of
the removal of certain fire hydrants by
the- Contra Costa Water Company
from the Fruitvale district. It is al
leged that they are not the property
of the water company. City Attorney
McElroy and Superintendent of Streets
Ott . were called and examined as to
the efforts they had put forth to keep
the, sidewalks clear in front of build
ings in course of construction.
Innocent Man Goes Free.
OAKLAND, Feb. 23.â By the con
fession of George H. Jackson, an ac
cused man, Edward R. Williams has
been exonerated of the charge of steal
ing a valise from the People's Express
Company. Jackson, a porter in the
company's employ, is, in jail and Wil
liams has been released.
HOPE TO SATE
CLARK'S SIGHT
Friends of Afflicted Young
Musician Prepare Benefit to
Raise the Necessary Funds
MANY OFFER SERVICES
Son of the Well-Known Choir
Leader Will Become Blind
Unless Given Greatest Care
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1118 Broadway. Feb. 23.
It is long since the warm sympathy
of people generally on this side of the
bay has been so thoroughly aroused as*
in the case of young Herbert Clark,
for whom a benefit is being planned,
to take place at Maple Hall next Sat
urday night. Young Clark is totally
blind, but the specialist, Dr. Adolph
Rosenthal of the German Hospital in
San Francisco, who is treating his case,
has hope that the sight of one eye may
be restored.
The case is especially sad, as the
young man became blind through the
ignorance or neglect of a physician in
Oregon, who burned the cornea with
nitrate of silver.
Oaklanders are taking a special in
terest in the coming benefit on account
of the unfortunate boy's father, Ben
Clark, who is one of the best-known
musicians on this side of the bay. He
was for years director of the First
Presbyterian Church choir here and
now holds the same position in the
First Congregational Church in Berke
ley.
He is also leader of the Masonic
Quartet.
Several prominent musicians of Oak
land have volunteered their services for
the benefit and they will be assisted by
a number of other clever entertainers,
including Al Hazard, the impersonator,
and Mrs. Carrie Fross Snyder, the read
er. Mrs. Carrie Brown Dexter is the
leading spirit in this most worthy
movement and she has arranged a
splendid programme, on which the
names, besides those already mentioned,
of Mrs. Carroll Nicholson, Miss Ida L.
Brooks, Miss Gertrude Hibberd. Alfred
Reed, Miss Florence Enery, F. H. Sew
ard. Miss Josephine Buttlar and Miss
Kstelle Drummond will appear.
Mr. Chapman has kindly given the
free use of Maple Hall for the occasion.
A number of society women are in
teresting themselves and will be pa
tronesses, the list including Mr3.
Thomas Crellin, Mrs. Isaac Requa. Mrs.
Will Havens, Mrs. Charles Webb How
ard. Mrs. Frederick Stratton. Mrs. John
Garber. Mrs. Oscar Luning. Mrs. J. Cal
Ewing, Mrs. George McXear, Mrs. H.
L. Whitehead, Mrs, J. N. Knowles and
Mrs. F. W. Henshaw.
The sale of tickets ha3 been unusually
large so far and everything seems to
indicate that Maple Hall will be taxed
to its utmost capacity. Seats are on
sale at Sherman, Clay & Co.'a store.
BEGIN INQUIRY INTO
WATER RATE FIXING
Council Takes Action to Save Legal
Complications Should Arbitration
Plan Fail to Consummate.
OAKLAND. Feb. 23. â In commit
tee of the whole to-night the City
Council decided to request the City
Attorney for an opinion as to the
proper procedure for the special com
mittee to follow in the selection of
the city's representative on the arbi
tration board, which shall fix a valu
ation of the Contra Costa Water Com-
pany's plant for rate fixing purposes.
The committee of the whole, in
compliance with the law, began the
required inquiry to-night in the mat
ter of fixing water rates. Councilman
Dornin explained that this evening's
move was taken that the Council
might not be caught napping should
the plan of arbitration fail.
In view of the explanation the com
mittee adjourned until next Monday
night after Councilman Dornin had
requested A. L. Adams, representing
the water company, to supply infor
mation concerning distribution of
water supply to the city of Oakland.

HATWARDS, Feb. 23. â E. K.
Ptrowbridge. son of J. H. Strow
bridge. one of the original contractors
for the Central Pacific Railroad, had
a narrow escape from death this af

attached to a wagon carrying five tons
of dried fruit over a small bridge on
his place in Castro Valley, when th*
bridge collapsed and the entire out
fit fell into the creek. The fall was
a dozen feet and the creek full of
water. The horses trampled young
Strowbridge into the bed of the
stream and he escaped by a miracle.
He was badly cut by the hoofs of thi
animals.

t^VLT LAKE, Utah. Feb. 23. â A
quantity of dynamite, sufficient to de
molish the building, was found in the
basement of the Dewey Theater at
Park City yesterday afternoon. At
tached to the explosive was a time ar

firmly beJieved by the police and the
managers of the theater that those re

of amusement while a performance
was beir.gr given. The discovery was
made accidentally. The janitor, who
seldom groes into the basement, went
there yesterday afternoon and in the
Femi-darkness stumbled over a large
box. As he arose he found that the
box had been placed over a bundle.
The Janitor carried the package up-
Ftairs. where it was found to contain
ten sticks of dynamite and the clock
work referred to. The explosive had
been carefully thawed out and other
wise prepared for its deadly mission.
The police were at once notified and
began work on the case. The matter
was kept quiet until to-day. The of
ficers now say that they have dis
covered evidence of a plot to blow up
the theater while a performance was
being given. They say that arrests
may be expected at any time.

The Popular
Vote of 1904
s Unanimously in Favor of Stuart's
dyspepsia Tabletsâ They Are
the Nation's Favorite.
No article on the market, whatever
be the purpose for which it was
created, can be a phenomenal success
and be universally popular unless it
possesses great and unfailing merit.
Inferior and worthless articles may
flourish for a limited time if their
praises are sung by sufficient clever
and catchy advertising; but their days
are numbered from the start and their
finish is a foregone conclusion. This is
an age of the survival of the fittest,
and only articles of true worth endure.
The unparalleled and phenomenal
Fuccess of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
from a business standpoint is not un-
natural nor surprising. It is due di-
rectly to their unparalleled and phen-
omenal success in curing multiplied
thousands of cases of dyspepsia
throughout the English-speaking
world.
The reason of the wonderful success
of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets is so
plain and simple that a child can un-
derstand. It is this and nothing
jnore; they are natural in their work-
ings and effects. They take up the
work of the worn and wasted stomach
and do it just as the stomach did when
it was well and strong and able. They
actually digest the food and do it thor-
oughly, completely and independently,
thus giving the weak and weary
Ftomach an opportunity to renew and
regain its wasted strength. You for-
get that you have a stomach Just as
you did when you were a healthy boy
or girl and nature restores and heals
that organ and makes it well and
Ftror.g.
A St. Louis business man says: "I
was a confirmed dyspeptic for years.
What I ate had to be forced down and
most of it soured or lay like lead in
nay stomach and did me no good. I
was in constant misery both in mind
end body and came to be cranky,
morose and irritable. My natural dis-
position, which was cheerful and
pleasant, left me and I was alienating
all my friends. Thedoctors did me no
good. I got so I h'ated the sight or
name of a doctor. My wife finally
worried me into buying a box of
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, which I
began taking under protest, as I had
no faith in anything or anybody. I
was sore on creation.
"I had not taken a third of that box
before I noticed a decided and most
welcome change. I could enjoy a good
meal and feel no bad effects following
it. I forgot my stomach and had a
t nance to think about something else.
I went ahead with my business in ease
and comfort. Six boxes of Stuart's
Dyspesia Tablets at a total outlay of
J â¢'â  cured me completely and I have
not suffered a pain from dyspepsia for
two years. I have an appetite like a
16-year-old boy. I wish every one
â¢who suffers from dyspepsia could
know what a change this great remedy
made in me."
Stuarts Dyspepsia Tablets are for
sale by druggists everywhere at 50
cents a box. All druggists. carry them
and the best doctors are prescribing
them. You need not fear that you will
ever be unable to get them; for, be-
cause of the gt>od they have done
mankind and the suffering they have
relieved and the happiness they have
caused, the fame and the success and
the popularity of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets from" generation : unto genera-
tion will endure. . . â .
FIXING BLAME
FOR EXPLOSION
Coroner's Jury Hears the Evi
dence in the Case of the Jack
son Point Disaster in Utah
LITTLE LIGHT IS GIVEN
Authorities Have Difficulty
in Placing Responsibility
for the Fatal Accident
OGDEN, Utah, Feb. 23.â As per ad
journment the Coroner's inquest over
the remains of those killed in the ex
plosion at Jackson Point last Friday
met in Ogden at 1:30 p. m. to-day and
continued hearing the testimony of the
witnesses.
Under the supervision of Justice of
the Peace William Horsley, who is
acting Coroner of Box Elder County,
the jury went to the hospital to get the
evidence of the injured, who are under
treatment there. The Greeks were un
able to understand English, so John
McCart and Arthur Mitchell, two
Americanized Greeks, were sworn in
a.2 interpreters. It was a rather slow
proceeding and not much information
concerning the accident could be elic
ited from the Greeke.
Besides these Greeks the testimony of
Sam Courtney, the conductor of the
water train, was taken. Courtney was
injured about the hips and back and
badly shaken up. He was questioned
as to the rules of the road in the make
up of trains in which there is a car
of powder and as to whether it was not
against the rules to place a car of
powder so near the engine.
Courtney was asked as to who. in
his opinion, was the person responsible
for the make-up of the train and fur
the accident, but he refused to make
any staiement. When asked if he had
any opinion in the matter he said that
he had, but did not care to state it at
present.
George Vosberg, being sworn, testi
fied that he was a brakeman on the
water train, going east. He was riding
on the engine until he saw that the
air did not work and Engineer Luna
whistled for brakes. He then got out
on the cars and set three brakes and
jumped off when he saw they could not
stop in time to prevent the accident.
In about five minutes after the
lision the explosion came. He thought
no one was to blame for the accident,
as the air did not hold,
A. H. Reed, the next witness, toid
about the same story. The jury then
adjourned until Thursday at 2 p. m.,
when they will meet in Brigham City
to hear the testimony of Engineer
Stanton and Brakeman Reid.
WOMEN ALMOST COME
TO BLOWS AT FUNERAL
3Iiss Groover and Widow of Percy
Calhoun Have Altercation at
Grave of Letter's Husband.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 23.â Because
the young woman In whose presence
Percy C. Calhoun blew out his brains
demanded that the coffin be opened and
she be permitted to take a last look at
the dead man, and because she tried to
place a floral wreath upon his coffin,
there was almost a general fight at
Calhoun's funeral to-day. The deceased
was married, but he had been associat
ing with Miss Pearl Groover. Yester
day at the inquest the dead man's
widow swore that the Groover girl was
the cause of her separation from her
husband. To-day at Evergreen Ceme
tery Miss Groover appeared just before
the coffin was lowered into the grave
and demanded that she be permitted to
look at Calhoun's body. Mrs. Calhoun
stepped forward and refused the re
quest, at which Miss Grover turned
upon the widow, and but for the inter
vention of others near by there would
have been a hair-pulling match. As it
was the young woman struggled to reach
the widow, but the latter stood her
ground. Then the girl demanded that
a floral offering she had brought be
placed upon the coffin, but the flowers
were hurled across the lot by a mem
ber of the funeral party. Miss Groover
was finally Induced to leave and the
funeral service proceeded.
BIG FIRE RAGES NEAR
IMMENSE GAS TANKS
Firemen Fight Flames Successfully
and Prevent Disaster at Their
Own Peril.
NEW YORK, Feb. 23. â In constant
danger of an explosion of three im
mense gas tanks, each containing
1,500,000 cubic feet of illuminating
gas, across the street, New York fire
men to-day fought a fire in a six-story
block on West Fifty-ninth street, be
tween Tenth and Eleventh avenues,
which was damaged to the extent of
$100,000. The gas remained in the
tanks throughout the fire, owing to
delay in finding the proper officials to
order it withdrawn, and a large part
of the apparatus called out by four
alarms was employed in drenching the
sides of the steaming reservoirs.
The fire had gained great headway
before the alarm was sent in and the
tall building was all ablaze when the
firemen arrived, endangering not only
the gas tanks, but adjoining tene
ments and a business block, but the
damage was confined to the one build
ing.
The front and rear walls of the
building fell simultaneously, several
firemen having narrow escapes.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 24, 1904.
HANNA GIVES
ALL TO FAMILY
Widow Is Granted One-Third
of Estate, Which Is Valued
at Three Million Dollars
ARE NO PUBLIC BEQUESTS
Heavy Life Insurance Is Not
to Be Considered in Set
tlement of Senator's Wealth
CLEVELAND, Feb. 23.â By the will
of the late Senator Marcus Alonzo
Hanna, probated to-day, an estate
valued at about $3,000,000 is left to the
family.
There are no public bequests.
The principal beneficiaries are the
widow, Mrs. Charlotte Augusta Hanna;
the son, Daniel Rhodes*Hanna; the two
daughters, Mabel Augusta Hanna Par
sons and Mrs. Ruth McCormick, wife
of Medill McCormick of Chicago.
A sister, Lillian C. Hanna Baldwin,
is given $10,000. aunt, Mrs. Helen
Converse, is given $1000, and each of the
grandchildren $5000.
The widow is given the homestead
property, all its furnishings, the stables
and the library in lieu of one year's
support.
Several years ago Senator Hanna
took out considerable life insurance
for the benefit of his three children.
The will provides that these gifts are
not to be taken into consideration in
the settlement of the estate.
The estate in the main is to be di
vided into three equal parts. The first
third was left to Mrs. Hanna, to re
main as her own during her natural
life, and at her death to be disposed of
by the trustees.
The remaining two-thirds is then to
be divided into three equal parts among
the three children, share and share
alike, the shares to be held in
trust for the children by the trustees,
who will conduct the affairs of each
and give to them the income from each
part.
In the event of the death of the two
daughters and that they have no chil
dren, then one-fourth of their shares
is to be given to their husbands and the
remaining three-fourths are to revert
back to Mrs. Hanna or her son, Daniel
Hanna.
The executors, Daniel Hanna, Mrs.
Hanna and L. C. Hanna, are not asked
to give bomls.
SELF-DEFENSE
WOOD'S PLEA
Declares That Rogers Fired
First and That He Was
Then Compelled to Shoot
WOODLAND, Feb. 23.â Cy "Wood,
who shot and killed his neighbor, Verne
Rogers, near Capay last Saturday, is in
the County Jail charged with murder.
Wood was brought down from Capay
Valley last night. According to his
story the shooting was done in self-de
fense. He declares that Rogers fired
first, and the subsequent statements of
Mrs. Wood, who seems to have been the
cause of the trouble, support this ver
sion.
Wood in his story says that he re
turned to^his home from Woodland last
Saturday afternoon and was told by
the men in his employ that his wife had
sent for Rogers, who lives about a mile
east. Wood says that he knew of an
infatuation existing between his wife
and Rogers and he was aware they had
planned to elope. Taking his rifle he
started to follow his wife, and soon
came upon her and Rogers sitting on
the edge of some bushes. As Wood
appeared his wife exclaimed, "There he
is now; you had best run." Rogers, ;
however, remained seated, but Mrs.
Wood arose and ran. Wood said that
he was wacthing his wife; but some
thing drew his attention toward Rog
ers. As he was turning he heard the re- i
port of a rifle and felt a sting in his |
right side. It was only a* flesh wound,
inflicted by the bullet from Rogers'
rifle. Wood then fired and the bullet
entered Rogers' face close beside the
bridge of the nose, causing instant
It was late Monday afternoon â two
days later â before any one other than
members of the family knew of the af
fair. Wood remained at his home, leav
ing the body of the dead man lying
where it had fallen in the brush. His
brother, John C. .Wood, had occasion
Monday afternoon to visit the ranch,
and when apprised of the facts advised
that the officers be immediately noti
fied. Wood was brought to the County
Jail in this city about midnight Mon
day. The Coroner left this morning to
hold an inquest
Later developments tend to compli
cate matters. There is little doubt that
Rogers was shot from behind. In the
back of the head just behind the ear is
a small bullet hole, while the front of
the face is horribly mangled, showing
that the bullet entered behind.
Deputy Sheriff Ernest Griffin said to
night that Mrs. Wood Is In Sacramento,
whither she had gone from Brooks,
Capay Valley, and had promised to
come to Woodland.

Kishenev Rioter Is Convicted.
KISHENEV, Russia, Feb. 23.â At

BULLET ENDS
LIFE'S BATTLE
Leroy E. Mosher, Weil-Known
Newspaper Man, Kills Him
self on Beach at Santa Monica
LEAVES PATHETIC NOTES
Wife's Sickness and Reverses
in ~ Business Affairs Cause
Him to Become Despondent
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 23.â Ruined
in health, his fortune depleted, his
wife slowly dying of an incurable dis
ease, Leroy E. Mosher. for many
years connected with the ( Los Angeles
Times and once 'Us managing editor,
ended the struggle of years this after
! noon by placing the muzzle of a re
; volver in his mouth and blowing out
his brains. The deed was committed >
on the beach half a mile north of the'
bathhouse at Santa Monica. No per
son witnessed it. A woman, whose
identity is not known, was walking
along the beach and came upon the
body, which was lying propped up
against a broad cement walk. She
gave the alarm and Dr. Fisher re
sponded, but death had ensued at least
ten minutes before.
In Mosher's lifeless hand was a re
volver and in his pocket a number of
notes, the text of which indicated that
suicide had long been premeditated.
Most of them were written to relatives
and others to intimate friends, but the
tenor of all of them is the same. They
are the last written effort of a man
who for years had been a ' forceful
writer and there is about their text a
touching pathos, j He considered life
a failure, said that there was no fur
ther use of his struggling, referred to
the popular disapproval of self-de
struction, but excused his action by
saying that greater men than he had
ever hoped to be had taken their own
lives.
He had nothing but kind words for
his friends and did not refer to his
enemies. Throughout the communica
tions there is a strain which shows
that he had long been struggling
against just what he did; struggling
to regain what he had lost and at last
growing weary had in an instant ended
the whole matter.
L. E. Mosher was a native of New
York State and was 55 years of age.
Early in life he moved to Kansas and
when but a boy he served throughout
the Civil "War as a member of a Kan
sas cavalry regiment. After the war he
became a telegraph operator and when
he came to California he entered the
employ of the Southern Pacific, ris
ing through the various steps until at
one time he was' assistant general
freight agent. Fortunate land invest
ments in this section brought him a con
siderable fortune. He acquired an in
terest in the Los Angeles Times and
several years ago greatly Increased his
holdings in that corporation and be
came an active factor in the manage
ment of the paper, bdth in the editor- -
ial and business departments. When
during the war with Spain General H.
G. Otis went to the Philippines, Mosher
was made managing /editor of the pa
per. Subsequently he went to New
York, where hft embarked in an as
phaltum business, which was financial
ly unfortunate, and there he left most
of his fortune. Then he returned to
Los Angeles and engaged in the plas
ter business, ' but that was not very
successful. A few months ago his
wife became ill of cancer, from which
a surgical operation gave only tem
porary relief. On one occasion to a
former associate on the Times, he had
threatened to commit suicide, saying
that his troubles were greater than he
could stand. The remains will be
brought to this city for burial to-mor
row.
WANTS HIS DAUGHTER'S
MARRIAGE ANNULLED
Petnlunm Man DecJAres That She Was
Only Sixteen When She Be
came a Wife.
SANTA ROSA. Feb. 23. â James H.
Williams began an action in the Su
perior Court here to-day to have the
marriage of his daughter, Maude, to
Edward Martin Kidd annulled. The
complaint recites that when the cere
money was performed the girl -was
only 1G years of age, and that the
consent of her parents was necessary
to a legal wedding. This not having
been obtained, the groom perjured
himself when he swore that his bride
was 18. The action is brought by the
father against his son-in-law, and it is
probable it will not be contested.
The couple were married on July 30,
1903, in this city, and resided here for
several months. Later they went to
Petaluma, the home of the bride's
parents. ' â u.'^r.
YE SIGN OF YE PEACOCK
IS NOW UNDER YE BAN
Police Commissioners Decide That
Ordinance Regulating Sale of
Liquors Is Violated.
The license of the restaurant at 229
Geary street owned by J. G. Kennedy
and known as Ye Sign of Ye Peacock
was revoked by the Police Commis
sioners last night. The place had
merely a restaurant license, but fre
quent complaints were made that a
retail liquor business was being car
ried on. Officer Reade was detailed
to investigate and had no difficulty
in procuring cocktails when he rep
resented that he was waiting for a
mythical "Mr. Johnson."
John P. Dwyer, who claimed that
his saloon on Seventh street was held
up on the morning of the 12th, was
also called before the board to show
cause why his license should not be
revoked. Two police officers testi
fied that on the morning in question
he was hopelessly intoxicated and his
place was wide open.' He was given
two weeks further, time in which to
prove he is fit to have a license. .
Officer John Crowley, charged with
reporting late and filing a false re
port, was fined $5. Peter Doherty,
accused of neglect of duty, must also
forfeit $5j of his salary. Michael
Whelton was found, guilty of unof
flcerllke' conduct and reprimanded.
James McMahon was appointed ex
tra patrol driver and Robert S. Cun
ningham a special. The Commission
ers, sitting as a pension board, placed
Augustus M. Caylt, who has been in
ill health, on the retired list.

POLICE SPOIL
HER HONEYMOON
LOS ANGELES. Feb. 23.â Charged
with having been associated with Carl
Anderson in the wholesale fraudulent
land deals, to which he has confessed,
Mrs. E. W. Allen, a bride of two days,
was taken into custody to-day in Pasa
dena and brought to the Los Angeles
jail. She confessed her guilt, but claims
that what she did was done without
guilty knowledge of Anderson's inten
tions. She was married on Sunday to
E. W. Allen, a wealthy oil man of Pas
adena. Before that her name was
Massey, and it was /mly by learning
that a woman named Massey had been
married that the detectives were able
to locate her.
According to the woman's confession
Anderson came to her last September
and asked her to represent herself to
be Mrs. Mary A. Grisvvold, with whom
he said he was in a real estate deal. He
offered to pay her $15, and for that sum
she went with him to the notary public,
signed a deed in the name of Mrs. Gris
wold, made affidavit that she was Mrs.

MARINE ENGINEER IS
ARRESTED FOR BIGA3IT
L. C. King Accused by G. W. McGloph
lcn of Having One More Wife-
Than Law Allows.
OAKLAND, Feb. 23.â Leonard C.
King was arrested here to-day and
lodged in jail on a charge of bigamy.
The charge was preferred by G. W.
McGlophlen of Seattle, who alleges
that King married his daughter in
that city a short time ago and brought
her to Oakland to live.
Recently, McGlophlen says. he
made the discover}" that King had
previously been married and had a
wife and child living in the East. He
immediately hied himself to this city
and with the assistance of the police
force and after several days' search,
located the couple in a lodging-house
here. King was promptly arrested
and wiU be sent back to Seattle for
trial and the girl will return home
with her father.
King says he is a marine engineer
by trade.

When learning to sing one must ac
quire the habit of holding out the chest
at all times, for nothing Is more detri
mental to a naturally good voice than
a cramped, inelastic chest. The breath
needs all the room possible if good
tones are to be produced, and the
lungs should be free to expand to their
fullest extent. They are nothing more
nor less than the bellows which blows
the air upward to meet the tone (as

explained in the previous lesson), and
there should be no restriction either
of tight clothing: or weak chest walls
if they are to do their work well.*
Let the pupil practice inhaling long
breaths slowly and as slowly exhaling
them. This may be done irrespective
of his vocal practice, and the best time
to do it would be on rising in the
morning and just before retiring at
night.
Let him try five breaths, one after
the other, as slowly as possible. While
doing this he should count ten (men
tally, not aloud) as evenly as the
Ftroke of a metronome, or better still,
let him use his metronome (alluded to
in a former lesson) for the purpose,
beginning to take his long breaths at
the count "one." starting to exhale it
at the count of "nix" :snd finishing
with the count "ten." This he should
do not more than five times on a
Ktretch at first. As soon as he finds
that he can increase the length of the
exercise without fatigue, however, he
must do so. gradually, until he is able
to take ten breaths in this way without
any fatigue.
This exercise, taken daily, morning
and night, occupies very littU time
and the benefit to be gained from it
is very great, both from a singer's
point of view and as an aid to general
health.
CHEST HELD OUT BY MEANS
OF "IMAGINARY STRING."
It is excellent training to practice
eway from the piano occasionally, for
it teaches the student to listen for the
"Intervals," and to become Independ
ent of the help of the piano. Let him,
for instance, sing an exercise through
from beginning to end and then, strik
ing the final note on the piano after he
has finished, he will see whether or
no he has been able to stay on the key
through the whole exercise. If not.
let him begin the exercise once more,
sing it half through and then, stop
ping, strike the note he has just sung,
on the piano. He will probably be
able to determine by this method
whether his voice began to fall (that
is, whether he began to sing'flat) In
the first half or the second half of the
exercise. This determined, let him
continue to hunt down the offending
note by dividing the exercise once
more.
The principle Is the same here as
in piano playing. If a mistake is made
do not co over and over the whole
thing. There is no advantage in that.
Find out just exactly where the trou
ble lies first and then rectify it, re
fraining from taking the exercise as
j whole until the little points that
need rectifying are all as they should
be.
Before we leave the subject of the
chest I wish to suggest one more aid
to the pupil who is trying to learn to
breathe and eventually to Bing prop
erly. It Is the "imaginary string"
again. I have brought it forward fre
quently in connection with finger
practice, and it will be found of just
as much help in regard to the chest.
Let . the pupil try to imagine that a
string fastened to the wall (across the
room from where he is standing) is
attached to the renter of his chest,
pulling it outward and upward, ac
cording to the illustration. He must
try to feel that this string is pulling
his lungs toward the oposite wall in
cessantly and is therefore causing
them to expand to their fullest extent.
If you try this yourself you will see
the material aid to be gained there
from.
i Now we will take up another singing
exercise. Standing as in the singing
exercise given in the last lesson let the
pupil first assure himself that throat
and chest muscles are all in a free,
relaxed, receptive condition. A little
tightening of even one muscle is enough
to spoil the whole tone. There should
be no feeling of confinement or re
straint anywhere. I cannot dwell too
emphatically on that.
Now let the boy take a deep breath,
and opening his mouth as wide as he
can (while still keeping the muscles
relaxed), let him sing "ah," beginning
on the note C (third space). The notes
to be sune in this exercise are C, D,
E, D, C. and the phrase must be taken
very slowly, holding the last note as
long as all the others together, that 16
four times as long as any one of the
other notes. One breath must do the
whole thing, and after the last note
has been sung the voice should die
away gradually, always as . long as
there is breath to sustain it.
In practicing the exercise just given
each note, while helping to make up
the entire exercise, must be a perfect
whole in itself. In sounding it the pupil
must think of the imaginary circle (ex
plained in the last lesson), and must
try to make that circle cover as large
a space as possible, as the tone follows
it. To aid him in this he may oc
casionally describe the circle with his
hand and arm, while singing the note.
This will help to keep tne voice free,
and will promote roundness of tone at
the same time.
The exercise may seem absurd to you,
but, believe me, it is not so. It is, on

four-four time) the final C is held four :
times as long as the other notes, as I !
: explained before. This enables the pu- i
pll's voice to traverse the imaginary !

beat it need not worry him at all. It }
will merely* denote a lack of strength |
in his muscles, and it is much better |
that way than to have him force the i
tone out by wrongly exerted strength.
As his strength Increases his power to
hold a tone will Increase in proportion,
! and It is quality we are looking for
Juet now. not quantity.
In practicing this exercise should be
repeated once as I have given it. After
this it should he sung in the next key
lower, taking B flat for the starting
note and finishing out the exercise as
before. It should be repeated on each
key and then moved* one key lower
after the exercise is completed. This
mode of practice should be carried as
far down the scale as can be done
without change of tone on the pupil's
voice. I mean by this.wlthout change
In the quality of sound. As I said- in
the last lesson/ we must be careful to
go neither too low nor too high in these
first exercises, particularly with a
child's voice! â¢
There is another suggestion I will give
for keeping a good tone when once it is
acquired. Take, for instance, our exer
cise of to-day's lesson. When starting
; on C tell the pupil to think of the note
\ D. This will elevate the tone and keep
, it where it should beâ In the top of
i the .head. Then, as in the course of the
; exercise the boy sings E, let him think
â¢ of C. This will help to equalize the
tones. It Is an excellent ruler and one
t that the pupil can apply. repeatedly In
> practicing either exercises or songs. It
i is only the old principle of getting
. ready beforehand in one more form.
â¢ The higher the note the longer ahead
â¢ one should prepare for it, and by so
Â» doing raise the tone of all the notes in
t terveninff.

HEAD TAX IN TRANSIT.
THERE is before Congress a bill for an act to im
pose a head tax upon all aliens entering the United
States for transit through the country. This bill
is said to be the work of the Federal Commissioner of
Immigration. If it become a law. all people from other
countries, entering the United States on tour, or for
transit from one coast or port to another, will be sub
jected to a head tax. Professor Bryce coming here to
study our institutions would be compelled to pay it.- So
also would Admiral Beresford of the British navy, if he
came again to visit our commercial bodies, and all of
the foreign visitors to the St. Louis Exposition would be
mulct alike.
We are not aware that any other country has such a
regulation. Europe seeks to encourage father than re
pel the annual influx of American visitors. Only Rus
sia puts difficulties in the way of foreign travelers, and
surely we have no desire to imitate her policy of exclu
siveness and isolation.
Just why the enactment of such a law is sought has
not been made plain. Granting the right of this country
to restrict undesirable immigration by imposing a head
tax on those who come to enjoy our institutions and op
portunities, as permanent settlers and intended citizens,
this new measure in no way responds to that proper pol
icy. As a revenue measure it is not needed, as we are
not in necessity for the money. In a large view this
country cannot afford to set up a policy of isolation that
will exclude the class of alien travelers that will be
turned away by such a law. We want them to come, to
use our facilities for travel and transit, to compare our
methods of transportation with those of the countries
from which they come, and to have free access to every
part of our country for the purposes of pleasure and
observation.
It may be said that the amount of the head' tax im
posed will not deter that class of people. But the
amount exacted does not figure in the matter at all. The
sentiment counts with the class of people who will avoid
us if the law pass. We boast, justly, of having created a
great country, with institutions which arc the admiration
of the world, with productive and industrial energies
that have given us the "primacy of the world's commerce,
and it will be a petty policy to charge an admission fee
to those who want to come and look upon what we have
done, to return to their own country and tell of the
wonders they have seen. The effect will be to exclude
all such people who will resent the regulation as an in
dignity, and we will be put in the same class as Russia
and Tibet. It is strange that any one should propose a
regulation that is but a modification of the isolation so
long maintained by China, Japan and Korea, which we
have aided in breaking down in those countries, bene
ficially to them and the world.
All American shipping and transportation interests
should protest against it. We are now on the highway
around the world. Our Atlantic and Pacific liners carry
great numbers of first-class passengers, who seek enjoy
ment of our facilities for travel and observation. They
contribute not only an important but a necessary 'part of
the income whicirkeeps these American enterprises go
ing. In respect of the facilities which they furnish we
have active and able rivals in the Canadian railways and
steamship lines on both oceans. These compete severely
now for such business, and get a considerable share pi it.
This competition is made sharper every year by the pos
sibility of combined rail and water rates, permitted on
the Canadian lines, but not in practice on the American
lines.
If the head tax be imposed it will mean the end of our
efforts to compete. The first-class transit business will
be diverted to the lines of Canada, and a blow will have
been struck at American shipping and transportation in
terests. It is a bad time to make such an issue. We are
reaching out for other markets and more foreign trade.
We have an annual surplus of the products of agriculture
and manufactures. We are being jealously watched by
our rivals in both. They are ready to seize upon any fact
and to appeal to any prejudice that may put us at a dis
advantage. Nothing can be devised that, will better
serve the purpose of our commercial rivals than this pro
posed law. It can be used all over Europe as an argu
ment against us, and as an appeal to prejudice that may
well countervail all of the advantages we now have in
resources and production.
Until some reasons are furnished for such a remark
able and injurious proposition, all we can do is to take
it for what it appears to be upon its face, and resist its
enactment into law. When the reasons for it are given,
they will be subject to impartial examination, but it
present it is believed that no theoretical benefits can off
set the practical disadvantages which are apparent.
An Oakland creature, misnamed a man because of the
poverty of the language, was sentenced to six months'
imprisonment the other day for brutally beating his
mother. What a pity it is that justice in cases like this
is circumscribed by civilized punishments. An animal
that beats its mother should be branded to warn all liv
ing things to beware.
A PURE FOOD EXPOSITION.
T ! HE retail grocers of San Francisco do themselves
much honor, and promise much benefit \o the
community, by their proposed pure food exposi
j tion, to be held here in April. The work of the Agricul
! tural Department has disclosed a'n alarmingcondition of
sophistication in imported wines and glassed 'and. tinned
goods. It is estimated that three-fourths of the foreign
j wines we take every year are adulterated. This adulter
i ation is not confined to such frauds as dried apple cham
pagne, and still wines treated with gypsum and anti
ferments, but includes the use of agents dangerous to
health. â¢- \.
California is vitally interested in the exposure of these
adulterations, and in establishing her own commercial
honor, because we produce and purvey a majority of the
articles which are the subject of adulteration abroad.
1 Other nations are as particular as we are about the
. sanitary conditions of their imports, and one necessary
i "precedent to finding a .market for our products is the
I establishment of their purity. .'â ';.'â -'.
;j Already it is reported that the proposed exposition has
â¢ fifty-seven applications for space, and as this was before
s the intention to have an exhibit was made public it
! shows an admirable spirit on the part of the projectors
! and exhibitors. We want it established that our wines,
r jellies, jams, canned goods, dried iruits, spices, syrups,
. brandies. and other luxuries and necessities are pure and
I 1 wholesome, so Jiandled and preserved as to make them
[ I fit for use, and beneficiahinstead' of risky and harmful.
I' The consumers cannot effect.this. . Itmust be done, by
the producers and dealers. The retail grocerymen stand
next to the consumer, between him and the producer and
manufacturer. When they show this excellent deter
mination to secure purity of the articles in which they
deal, and enforce it by refusing to handle goods that are
impure, a long and important step will be taken admoni
tory to the producer and manufacturer. Perhaps the
negative resistance to sophistication is the most power
ful. When the retailers combine to .sell only an article
that is pure, the same class of goods impeached for im
purity will be cut off from the means of reaching the
consumer, and to find a market -their producers must
conform to the sanitary standard.
One objection heretofore urged to the pure food
movement has been the supposed necessity of blacklist
ing and exposing noxious and unfit goods. This is ob
viated by whitelisting pure and fit products. In that
way the producers and manufacturers who strictly ob
serve the principles' of commercial honor get their re
ward and the adulterators get their lesson.
The general public will show a proper spirit of en
couragement of a movement that so intimately concerns
its welfare^ These retailers stand for the cradle and
0 m
against the grave, for a chance for children to grow in
strength unpoisonedby the food they eat, and for the
health of men and women, and for that vigor which
equips them for the duties of life. x
A young man of this city, who was draughtsman by
day, counterfeiter by night an<f professedly a Christian
on Sunday, has met the fate of everybody who tries to
be a jack-of-all-trades and a master of none. To have
been successful in any one of the three professions he
essayed would .have consumed all of his time and intel
ligent activity.
OCEAN SHIPPING INTERESTS.
AT a recent hearing before the House Committee on
Merchant Marine and Fisheries a number of im
portant facts were submitted bearing upon the
urgent need of legislation for the upbuilding of our mer
chant marine. To a large extent of course the facts were
essentially the same that have been so often repeated
during the campaign of education carried on by the
friends of American shipping, but some of the statements
concerning the personal experiences of shipowners and
shipbuilders were new and merit attention by reason of
the light they throw upon the obstacles in the way of our
shipowners when competing for trade against the subsi
dized ships of other nations.
One of the most interesting of these personal state
ments was made by Alfred Windsor, president of the
Boston Steamship Company. A report of the hearing-,
given by the Washington correspondent of the Iron Age,
â 
says:
"Mr. Windsor gave some practical illustrations of
present conditions in the shipbuilding industry. Several
years ago, when- the subject of aiding the merchant ma
rine was agitated in Congress, the Boston Steamship
Company began to build, a 5000-ton vessel, and another
new company was started which built two vessels of 12,
000 r ton's, capacity each. The original intention was to
run them to England, but the expected Congressional aid
did not come, and it was soon reen that there was no
opportunity in running to British ports against the sub
sidized mail steamers. Then the company made up
its mind that, as the United States had taken possession
of the Philippine Islands, there was a chance to build up
a line to Manila. The ships referred to were therefore
placed on \he Pacific Coast and were run from Puget-'
Sound and Seattle to Japan, Hongkong, Manila, Vladi
vostok and Port Arthur. But right alongside of these
vessels a line of British ships is running, that of the
Canadian Pacific Steamship Company, subsidized to the
amount of $.500,000 a year, while running directly into
Seattle is a Japanese steamship line receiving^ $800,000
per annum in subsidies in addition to a bounty of $10 per
ton for every ship that is built. There is not sufficient
merchandise moving to and from the Philippines to begin
to load the company's large ships and a heavy annual
loss is being made. Such a business cannot be carried
on indefinitely and the only end in sight is the hauling
off of those ships or placing them under a foreign flag."
The experience of the Boston Steamship Company is
not an isolated case. As a matter of fact the inability of
American ships to compete with the subsidized lines of
other countries is now so well recognized that the con
struction of deep sea vessels in American shipyards for
American owners has virtually ceased. It is stated that
since June, ioor, not a keel has been laid in any American
shipyard on either coast of the United States for one
steel ship designed for. foreign commerce. That is the
condition to which our once proud shipping industry has
been reduced. While our foreign trade is advancing by
leaps and bounds we are paying tribute to foreigners to
carry it, as if we were, incapable of maintaining a mer
chant marine of our own. .
With something of a spectacular flourish and a touch
of sentiment, that carries more than a suggestion of
sham, Japan has made known to the world that the
court jewels are to be pledged to increase the war
funds. In our stern matter of fact days, however, accu
racy of gun fire, not maudlin sentimentality, counts in
the game of War. A plethoric war chest is the most
vital element in war's success.
A United States lieutenant and six privates contrib
uted with their lives recently to our splendid scheme of
imperialism and expansion. The unfortunates were
murdered by the natives of Samar, who areTnow in the
process of civilization. Few of us even know the names
of the victims.* Fewer still even care who they were.
As our mass expands its individual components become
of less and less importance.
Perhaps the affair that most deeply concerns Oakland
as a municipality at the present time is a united effort
of her citizens to beautify their town. No worthier pur
pose can: inspire the people. We give too much to util
ity, too little to the ideal; too much to commercialism,
too little to that ultimate purpose for the success of
which commercialism should be only a means to an
end.
Having very thoroughly occupied Korea, Japan, it is an
nounced, is in.no haste to advance the operations of her
land campaign. Everything indicates at St. Petersburg,
however, that the progress made by the brown men has
been rapid enough to suit the most captious critic. Â«.':
'- Dr. Amador has been chosen the first President of
the new republic of Panama. Let us hope that he may
prove himself the great ruler of a small people and that
his introduction into the family of nations will never be
cause of regret for his sponsor and protector. \
TALK OF THE TOWN
AND TOPICS OF THE
TIMES
The Father.
Pietro wanted of all things in lifeâ a
goat. Every morning when he went
down the hill to his work in the smell
ing kitchen of Lotnbardo's restaurant
he would stoo off at the home of old
Gregorio. there* in the little green patch
on the edge of the quarry, and he would
look longingly at the little brown and
white mottled kid which skipped about
on the hill crest with its queer little
stiff legged hops, so near and yet so
far out of reach. For old Gregorio had
said that he would sell it for $2 if
Pietro could raise the money before the
end of the month; otherwise the gay
little animal went to the butcher.
So it was that every evening when
Pietro had climbed up the cleated
streets of the hill and fc-und himself
again in hi* cubbyhole of a room he
would go to the mattress on the floor 1
and pull out from under it the shiny 1
cylinder bank for dimes which he had
received from the good priest on
Christmas. Day by day the increas
ing pile of dimes within registered
nearer and nearer to the $2 mark, and
Pietro had already made arrangements I
with Beronio to allow his kid the run ,
of the little back yard up near where ;
the old castle use,d to stand. !
One gray night when Pietro had
climbed back to the dingy shanty he
called home he heard the familiar
sound of woman's walling and hoarse
curses within. The father was drunk
again. Pietro sneaked in by the back
way and was stealing to his room on
the top floor, when he sickened and
paused at the sound of the family
racket coming from his own room. He
peeped through the open door.
There was the father bending over

"It is really remarkable what same

the United States District Court the
other day.
"Now I know a printer who is em
ployed on one of the morning papers
here in town, who has to take a re
markable precaution against his love
for a little tipple on each recurrent
Saturday night. Just as regularly as
the end of the week comes around the
unfortunate printer starts out to for
get himself and dcas not come to until
Monday morning. Until recently every
Monday morning saw him 'broke' abso-
lately.
"But, finding that he was powerless
to abstain from his weekly period "of
gilded joys and the consequent impov
erished exchequer of Monday, this man
adopted a peculiar remedyâ against the
blue Monday only. I am sorry to say.
Every Saturday when he received his
week's pay he would go around to
the branch postofflce on New Mont
gomery street and there make out and
mail to himself a money order for all
of his salary save the $5 which he had
set aside for his 'bust.' Then on Mon
day the postman would bring to his
lodgings the money order and the prin
ter's purse would be saved for the re
mainder of the week."
Elm Tree or Palm.
OAKLAND. Feb. 23.
Editor Call: As a subscriber to your
paper and a property owner on Tele
graph avenue and an opponent of the
elm tree planting on said avenue, I
was much interested in an article in
your editorial of February 14, which
reads, "it goes without saying that if
a winter inonth picture of a Southern
California scene had no trees in It but
the leafless elm. sycamore and other
deciduous trees, it would attract no at
tention at all.
"As a start at pulling together we
advise Oakland and all cities in this
section of the State to pull up their
deciduous trees on the streets and put
instead palms, etc.
' r A professor in the university lifted
his pen against the palm and he is
from a wintry country; he desires to
give a winter aspect to our cities."
The professor has captured our city
government.
I have not heard of a single property
owner on the avenue who wants the
elm tree. Their objections to it would
take up too much space in your paper.
I have informed Mayor Olney myself
of the people's opposition to the elm,
but he Bays it has been decided upon;
that On the streets running north and
south it will be the elm or sycamore
and east and west the palm.
That is the way the matter stands.
Southern California will be all summer
in appearance and we will be half and
half â half summer and half winter.
This to please a professor of the uni
versity. Yours truly, i %-, 7

Pension Oddities.
The economists, for instance, mny !
find consolation in the statement made
here that the pension system was the
greatest as a burden to the people of
the United States in 1893, since which
time the burden has been constantly
decreasing until it has shrunk in ten
years from $2 24 to $1 32 per $1000 of
taxable wealth. In ten years more,
Mr. Ware thinks, the burden will cease
to be noticed, unless some new legisla
tion, is enacted, such as that recently
demanded by the Grand Army of the
Republic, in which case it may be
larger for a while instead of tesa. The
report places the total number of pen
sioners now on the rolls at 996,545, of
which 729.356 are soldiers and 267,189
are widows and dependents.
, It is interesting to learn that what
the Commissioner calls "the unknown
army," that is, the living soldiers of.
the Civil War who have not applied
for pensions, numbers about 200.000,
or. about 30 per cent of the total nuxn-
her of survivors, who are placed at
about 900.000. This "unknown army
is applying for pensions at the rate
of about 14,000 a year. Mr. Ware
estimates that if the pension laws re
main unchanged this army in five
years more will be reduced to about
60.000 and in ten years will cease to
be a factor. The Union soldier who
has the distinction of' being the first
to have a claim allowed at the Pension
Office appears to have been one Leo
pold chair a member of Company
G of the Twelfth Regiment, New York
Militia Infantry, whose claim was al
lowed August 12. 1861. Mr. Charrier.

Germany's Little War.
While watching the extreme Orient
with breathless concern the world haa
failed to realize that war on a smaller
scale, but of the most ruthless charac
ter, has been raging for months in Ger
man Southwest Africa. News from that
section of the globe Is obtainable only
in the merest driblets. But the meager
telegrams, that leave most of the story
untold, indicate nevertheless with ter
rible clearness that the white conquer
ors are fighting a hard-pressed battle,
not only for supremacy but for exist
ence. A small host of civilized men,
trusting to the power of higher intelli
gence and modern imp!ement3 of war,
have pitched themselves against the
overwhelming numbers of a barbaric
native population. And, as always
when such is the case, a struggle be
tween the invaders and the indigenous
threatens to bring with it that most
awful feature of warâ the massacreinjj
of women and children. Rumors have
already told of the slaughtering of
whole German families and the tortur
ing of captives by the rebellious blacks,
but so far they have remained unveri
fied.
The territory involved lies In the
southwestern corner of Africa, imme
diately north of Cape Colony, from
which it is separated by the Orange
River. It stretches itself some 900 miles
along the coast to the north, with an
average width of about 500 miles. Its
total area exceeds that of Texas by just
one-fourth. The coast districts are only
wastes, but the inland, which is moun
tainous, offers excellent chances both
to the agriculturist and the miner. The
total native population is thought to
number 200,000. while the whites do nut
exceed 7000.â Collier's Weekly.

Supervisors' Health Committee
Explains Connection With
Beef Contracts at Almsliouse
MAKES LONG STATEMENT
Says It Always Insists on a
Strict Compliance With Speci
licalions Regarding Supplies
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
reopivrd a statement submitted by Su
pervisor O'Anrona, chairman of the
Health Committee, relative to the po
sition occupied by the committee in
th<j matter of awarding contracts for
beef at the Almshouse. The state
ment follows:
As the action of the Committee on Hospital
and Health of your predecessors In awarding
contract* for b*-Â«-Â» at the AlmÂ«hcu*Â«Â» has been
C(jmmentÂ»d on in a report of a committee of
th<? Board vt Health as published, by the press,
I present the following Matement in <Â«rd^r
that jour honorable body may be advised of
tht- facts in relation thereto.
About three years ago the hospital commit
tee in oi*n session was- consider! nt the bids
fcr dry eix>ds, drugs, KUpplley. etc., for the
City and County Hospital. Representatives
of the various biddvri! were pr^nent. The bhlÂ«
for the Aim* house had already been opened
and contracts awarded by the Hoard, of Super
visor*. I called tlie attention of the commit
teÂ«? tÂ« the fa.u that the bids were higher for
several articles, notably coal and tx'ef. than
for the MOM article* on the schedule of the
Almshouse and afked the committee to con
sider the advisability of rejecting all Â»uch
hiils. it wan explained by one of the bidders
that t*>e coat of some rupiilire furnished the
hoKÂ£>lta1 would bo greater because under the
tornis of the <=i>eciflcaiions the contractor was
ro-.'jired to deliver the supplies at the hos
pital, whereas the Almi-house attended to the
delivery itself. Cine of the bidders stated that
while the then Kui-erlntendent of the Alms
house niii late Captain Ueddy) required first
class meat, the commiMary of the hospital de
mandfd meat that was not only flrst-claes,
but the choicest and best of the first class, re
jecting beef for the most trifling reasons. None
of the bidders and no member of thÂ« commit
tee xuBgefted cr Implied that meat or anything
else was to he supplied the hospital or Alms
hou*<* inferior in quality to the requirements
of the specifications. Considering that the In
mate* of the hospital are sick with acute di6
e&Ke the committee decided that the city
fhuuid be willing to pay a little more that
the patients at the hospital might .receive the
best obtainable supplier. During the last four
year* b<Â»ff furnished the Almshouse has cost
'.C-l'x*. 5:;-l<Â«i, :;ii- lini and .'IB-loo of a cent, re
spectively, 1Â»>fs than that furnUhed the hos
pital. M the F;>eclflcetions prepared by the
t^uiwrvipors calling for !Â«ef, frech, first quality
American steer, be enforced by the superin
tendent und commissary, the meat received by
the Inmates of the Almshouse must be fiatls-
Your Committee on Hospital and Health has
invariably informed the bidders at the time
twardf were made that no far as It was within
the power of the Supervisors contractore would
be required to meet the terms of the specifi
cations, and where the superintendent of the
hospital or AlmEhouse has complained that
contractors were offerins supplies that were
not !n accordance with the specifications your
committee has directed that the superintend
ent reject the supplies and make their pur
chases in the open market, charging the ex
eesf In price to the contractors. During the
four years that the undersigned was chair
man of your committee and during the two
months of the present administration there
has not been one case in which the commit
tee or any of Its members has allowed or agreed
trÂ» allow the acceptance of supplies except in
accordance with the terms of the speclfica-
As the superintendents and commissaries of
the hosÂ»iitÂ«l and Almshouae are not appointed
by the Supervisors and are not subject to their
direction, receiving their appointment and or
ders from the Board of Health,- the Super
visors cannot be held responsible for the man
ner in which they perform their duties.
During the last four yaers t* "^spital Com
mittee has taken the greatest pains to arrange
contract schedules that wo"uld include every
thing that the various Institutions would re
quire, to prepare specifications such that the
greatest possible number of bidders may com
pete for the city's business, and that con
tractors may be held to the terms of their
agreements. For the faithful execution of
these contracts the Supervisors are dependent
upon the Board of Health.

sors' Questions in Gas Inquiry
The Board of Supervisors yesterday,
sitting as a committee of the whole,
resumed its investigation into the
financial operations of the San Fran
cisco Gas and Electric Company with
a view to fixing the rates to be charged
for light and power during the next
fiscal year.
General Manager Lawless submitted
statements regarding the valuation of
the three olants absorbed by the cor

tail the various amounts- fixed as the
value of soeciflc items in the state
ments. So desultory was the inquiry
that most of it was conducted with
only eight Supervisors present, or two
short of a Quorum.
In his statement General Manager
Lawless said:
The actual cost and valuation of the entire
manufacturing gas plant we fix at $9,476,-

In lamps the Pacific Company has $336 70
invested, leaving $77,152 07 for the San Fran- .

of the Pacific Company on Hutter street and
the building at Third and Townsend streets,

BATTLE OF THE FLOWERS
IS STILL IN PROGRESS
Merchants' Association Recommends Adoption of Ordi
nance to Establish Free Markets in Central PlacesâRe
tail Dealers Say They Seek Protection Against Venders
Two communications were sent to the
City Hall yesterday concerning the satu
of flowers on the streets* in this city.
One of these, from the Retail Florists'
Association, thanked the Board of
Works for its action in ordering the
removal of flower vendors from thÂ«
street corners and making various
statements concerning the manner In
which the fiower selling on the street*
has been conducted. A communication
was forwarded by the Merchants' As
sociation in which the establishment of
free flower markets at certain desig
nated points was advocated. This was
addressed to the Supervisors, who are
urged by the Merchants' Association
to pass an ordinance naming certain
places to be known as "the free flower
markets of San Francisco." The es
sential part of the Merchants' Associa
tion communication is as follows:
Inasmuch as the difficulty heretofore seems
to be that the llower venders had no legal
permit to occupy any sidewalk, and that the
Board of Public Works cannot grant this priv
iUge except under authority conferred by a
general ordfnanop, and that the privilege here
tofore enjoyed by certain flower venders was
lestrlcted to them and was therefore a spe
cial privilege, which la contrary to the spirit
of our charter, we therefore suggest that the
correct solution of this problem Is for the
city to officially designate certain localities
in the most frequented parts of the city as
free public flower markets, open to all per
sons who comply with the rules and regu
lations governing the same. We believe that
such regularly established free flower mar
kets are desirable and should be established,
and therefore respectfully recommend your
honorable board to i>ass an ordinance desig
nating tho following localities as free flower
markets of San Francisco:
SUGGEST MARKET SITES. .
The outer portion of the sidewalk adjacent
to and surrounding Union Square, to be known
as the Union Square Free Flower Market; the
outer portion of the sidewalk surrounding toe
Donahue Fountain, to be known as the Dona
hue Fountain Free Flower Market; the small
triangular space formed by the Intersection
around the flagpole at the intersection of Cali
fornia, Dremm and Market streets, to be
known as the California-street Free Flower
Market; the outer portion of the sidewalk
suiTOunding Portsmouth Square, to be known
as the Portsmouth Square Free Flower Mar
ket: tlie outer Dortion of the sidewalk sur
rounding Washington Square, to be known
as the Washington Square Free Flower Mar
ket: the outer portion of each of the slde
v/alks at the Intersection of Market and Kearny
street*, Kearny and Geary streets, Geary and
Market streets. Market and Third streets, and
extend along each of said streets for a dis
tance of fifty feet from each of said Inter
sections, to be known as the Central Free
Flower Market.
The outer portion of each of the sidewalks
at the IntersectrSft of Market and Powell
streets, Powell and Eddy streets, Eddy and
Market Ftreets, and extending along each of
said streets for a distance of nrty feet from
each* of said Intersections, to be known aa the
Powell-street Free Flower Market.
That the following regulations governing the
use of these flower markets be provided: That
any person holding a flower peddler's license
Fhall. without further expense, be permitted to
sell flowets at any or all of said markets; that
the selling of flowers shaJl be confined within
a Foace of three feet from the outer edge of j
the cuib of the sidewalks designated; that no
permanent stands shall be placed at any of
these flower markets, and all flowers, baskets
and other materials used shall be removed by
the venders every evening before departure;
that on Saturday and holidays any person may '
sell flowers at aÂ«y or all of the free flowerj
markets without any license.
We believe that this plan Is the, true eolu- '
tion of the question and the fact that San
Francisco has officially established free flower
markets will be even a greater attraction and
advertisement Sot the city than the small
stands heretofore occupied on certain side
walks, which were simply permitted on suffer
ance, and known as flower markets.
With the letter was a draft of an
ordinance embodying the provisions
suggested in the foregoing.

CONTEST OVER THE CLARK .
liSTATE IS COMPROMISED
Sisters of Woman Who Took Her Own
Life at McXutl's Hospital Will
Divide Property.
As was announced a week ago at
the last hearing of the contest of the
will of Isabella D. Clark, who com
mitted suicide at McNutt's Hospital
last September, the contestants, Alice
Ann Hart and Mary E. Carter, sisters
of the deceased, have compromised
their suit with their sister, Grace E.
Strohn of La Grange, III. A dismissal
of the contest was iXiad yesterday and
when the case was called for trial in
Judge Coffey'8 court Carter P. Pome
roy, one of the attorneys for the con
testant, moved that the matter be dis-
missed. His motion was granted.
Although the terms of the compro
mise have been withheld from the
public, it is understood that the three
sisters have agreed to each take a
third of their sister's^$300,000 estate.
Under the disputed will the entire
estate went to Mrs. Strohn. She and
Dr. McNutt were named as executors
of the will, but have declined to act.
They have delegated that duty to At
torney C. P. Eells and the latter has
filed a petition to be appointed admin
istrator of the estate.

Slinson, Poheim and Hushes began
an investigation yesterday morning to
determine if the work of the food In
spection department Is being properly
done. Health Officer Ragan appeared
and presented the results of the inves
tigation ho had instituted. Dr. "W. C.
Hassler and Food Inspector Robert
son appeared and gave testimony as
to the conduct of the department, in
which it is charged that there has
been much laxity. The Investigation
will be continued this morning.
Would Care for Ferslow Boy.
Sister Julia Henderson of the Epis
copal Sisters of Charity yesterday ap
plied to the Superior Court for letters
of guardianship over the person of lit
tle Harold Ferslow, the boy : that was
placed upon a red hot stove by his
grandmother, Victoria Ferslow. A
similar petition was filed several days
ago by M. J. White, secretary of the
California Society for the Prevention
of .Cruelty to Children. The grand
mother was sent to the County Jail
for six months for her cruelty.
asphyxiation from the carbon-monoxide
in its composition. This would affect
the rate, as it might cost more to make
a.Dure gas and Lawless promised to
submit a statement on the point.
The Investigation ; will be resumed
next Thursday at 2:30 p. m.
C. Jaeger as secretary, opened with a
statement that justice had been done
by the Board of Works in removing the
fiower venders from the street corners
and that permitting them to remain
would have been an injustice that no
city in the United States would have
permitted. Credit was given to the
retail florists of San Francisco for the
high condition of floriculture in Cali
fornia. It was asserted that the flower
venders raise tht; prices for flowers in
the stores. Then the communication
went on to make these assertions:
During the last four months foreigners Who
reside in Han Mateo County And grow violets
formed themeelves Into an association and
compelled the retail stores to pay the same
price as their men sold for on the street-
Every %-ender eelllnar Hower* In front of the
Chronicle building was In the employ of this
Violet Association, and was paid
Jl r><> a day for his services. When a retail
etorekeejw objected to paying the same
amount es they could be bought for on the
strict the grower would say, "Po as you
please; If you don't want them I will jiut an
other man on the street twlllne them." So
they actually used the vender's privilege to
club the tetuilers into paying high prices tor
their stock,
Now come the Japs and the Chinese doing
the same thin*. They hold their prices up to
the storekeepers and dump what they have
left to the peddlers for what they can get.
Now if there are no venders on the streets
their prices mun come down and the public
set the benefit, as the competition among the
stores Is so sreat that prices will always be
low. . Aa a proof violets are selling in some
of the stores since your order took effect at
5 cents a bunch.
We only want protection, the same as other
business men have. We pay high rents; we
pay taxes; we are all citizens; we are Just a*
deeply Interested In the future of San Fran
cisco as any other business houses. . All char
itable and tMIkIouh societies make a business
when they want flowers to go to the retail
etore for their donations, and they have always
been freely given.
If at any time your honorable board feel*
like revoking your order we will pay you $100
rer month for the prU'ilege of selling flowers
in front of the Chronicle building, and pay a
license for each and every man selling there,
but we sincerely hope that the day has gone
by when the flower vender is permitted to In
terfere with legitimate business exclusively In
our line.
California fruit Is far more of a novelty to
Easterners and tourists than venders of bou
quets, and. U In your wisdom you decide to
retain the venders on the streets, then in Jus
tice to the fruit growers of this State allow
fruit, flowers and sunshine to mingle together
In front of the Chronicle office.
TO DISTRIBUTE
BEQUEST FUNDS
Supervisors Deckle on a New
, Plan for Disposition of Money
Left by Robinson and Windcl
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
adopted the following resolution relative
to the future disposition of the Robin-
sonand Windel bequest funds:
"Resolved, That the following persons
be and they are hereby appointed to
act as an advisory committee with his
Honor the Ma/or and the Board of Su
pervisors in the matter of the expendi
ture of the Robinson bequest interest
fund and the Henry Windel bequest
fund: "Mrs. William M. Pierson, In
fants' Shelter; Mrs. E. F. Preston,
Nursery for Homeless Children; Mrs.
Henry Payot, Children's Hospital, Vnd
Miss Kate Felton, Associated Chari-
ties."
"Nine-tenths of the money in this
fund is practically thrown in the
streets," said Payot, "and it is not be
ing distributed in accordance with the
bequest provisions made by H. E. Rob
inson."
The Finance Committee decided to
call a conference of City Treasurer Mc-
Dougald and County Clerk Oreif for
the purpose of taking steps to collect
the collateral inheritance taxes from
estates of, deceased persons. Deputy
Treasurer Whlteside informed the com
mittee that the sum of $300,000 of such
taxes remains uncollected, and it was
imperative that an additional clerk be
employed to collect the money.
Deputy Health Officer Levy appeared
before the committee In behalf of bills
presented by the, Health Board for car
fare and buggy hire expended in Janu
ary by subordinates. The bills' com
prised $10 for Dr. T. Rottanzi, Dr. G.
Purlenky $10, B. M. Hinkle $15, Dr. A.
P. O'Brien $10, Dr. J. G. Morrissey $10
and Dr. D. F. Ragan $20.
. The committee passed the demands of
the Civil Service Commission for ex
pressage of tables and chairs used in
an examination, but Informed Secre
tary Moran that hereafter no such bills
will be audited unless the .expense is
first authorized by the committee.
Chief of Police Wittman submitted
an ordinance prohibiting the obstruc
tion by meetings, crowds or persons in
the district bounded by Second, Mis
sion, Ninth, Larkin, Bush and Mont-

HOLDS BOND
ISSUE LEGAL
Judge Sloss Sustains Demurrer
of City to Suit for Injunc
tion Brought by Capitalist
DENIES LEAVE TO AMEND
Petitioner Will Immediately
Appeal. From Decision and
Take Case to Supreme Court
Whether the Supervisors have the
right to issue the bonds voted for at
the last election is a question that is
now up to the Supreme Court. Judge
Sloss of the Superior Court is of thÂ«*
opinion that the Supervisors acted
within tneir rights by accepting the
verdict of the voters on the question.
By sustaining yesterday the demurrer
ot the city to the suit of Capitalist
Herbert E. Law for an injunction re
straining the Board of Supervisors
from issuing the bonds he ended *the
matter so far as his court is concerned,
as he granted no leave to amend the
complaint demurred to. By his decis
ion Judge Sloss hastens a decision in
the matter, for even if he had decided
the matter in favor of Law an appeal
to the Supreme Court would have been
taken by City Attorney Long. As it
is now the case is up to the highest
State tribunal without the loss of time
that would necessarily follow a test of
its merits In the lower court. In view
of the fact that the Supreme Court
has already decided that the issuance
of bonds under conditions prevailing
1h a valid act it is expected that Judge
Sloss' decision will be sustained.
ATTACKS ENTIRE ISSUE.
In the suit filed by Law the entire
bond issue was attacked as Illegal. It
was contended first that the ordinance
calling for the issuance of the bonds
was void in that it mentioned more
than one subject -in its title. Another
contention made by Law was that the
purchase of land for any city purpose
should first be voted upon and the
bonds for its payment provided for at
another election. This contention, ac
cording to the attorneys for the city,
was satisfied by the bond election,
which generally provided- for a munici
pal indebtedness of $17,771,000. In otlier
words, they contended the voting of
bonds and the prescribing of the pur
poses to which they applied included
the purchase of land necessary to carry
those purposes into effect.
A third contention made by Law was
that the bonds for schools were illegal
because the establishment of schools
is a State affair. Money, it was as
serted, could not be set aside for school
purposes, except as provided In the
general law. The city's reply to this
was _that the Supreme Cdtirt has fre
quently held that the building and
equipping of schools is a municipal af
fair. In a case recently appealed from
Oakland the court held that provision
for schools could be made by a city
charter.
VOTING NOT REGULAR.
. The final objection raised by Law
was that the bonds for Telegraph Hill
Park were not regularly voted. It was
asserted that* each proposition should
have two-thirds of all the votes cast.
Less than two-thirds of the full vote
was in favor of Telegraph Hill, but
over two-thirds of the votes cast on
that proposition were in its favor. This,
Attorneys Long and Brobeck contend
ed, was sufficient to meet the require
ments of the law. In a San Joaquln
case the Supreme Court, they said, re
cently approved a bond issue made un
der a similar vote and only last week
in a Santa Rosa case upheld its former
decision.
Attorney H. C. McPike, who appeared
for Law. made but a short argument
in reply to the attorneys for the city.
When he concluded Judge Sloss at once
sustained the demurrer, rormally^ de
claring that the entire bond issue' was
fully in accordance with the charter
and the general law of the State.
The appeal to the Supreme Court will
be- advanced at*once by City Attorney
Long and will probably be decided
within the next six months. To obtain
an early decision the Supreme Court
will be asked to place the matter on
the calendar of its next term.

ROWING CLUB

Board of Pu'lilic Works Issues
Peremptory Instructions for
the Removal of Buildings
CLEARING THIRD STREET
Santa Fe Railroad Company Is
Ready to Begin Construction
of Bridge Across Channel
Acting on a communication from CiUr
Engineer Grunsky, the Board of Public
Works took action yesterday morning
that will result in the immediate re
moval of the obstructions ot the foot
of Third street and the construction
of a new bridge across the channel.
The Santa Fe Railway Company has
long been anxious to build a bridge at
this point, but the street is blocked
by the house of the South End Rowing
Club, a lumber yard and a brick yard.
All parties were long ago notified ttr
remove, but with the exception of the
South End Rowing Club no attention
was paid to the order. This organiza
tion requested an extension of time
and was granted until July 1, 1903. No
further attention was paid to the mat
ter and there it apparently dropped.
Now the railroad company is ready to
go ahead with its improvements and
finds the street still obstructed.
Officer Beach was started out yes
terday morning with formal notifica
tions to the persons blockading the
street to remove the obstructions forth
with. In the event o-f their failure to
comply with the mandate the Board
of Works will take matters In its own
hands and summarily eject them. In
a letter to the Board of Works City
Engineer Grunsky says:
In a letter Just received from W. D. Nich
olson, assistant engineer of the Atchison. To
peka and Santa Fe Railway Company, this of
fice is advised that the contract for the con
struction of the foundation of the bridge
across Channel street at Third haa been
awarded to the Thomson BrÂ«~^e Company, and
that work thereon Is to commence at once.
He calls attention to the necessity for the Im
mediate removal of the obstructions on Third
street, between Channel and Berry.
Resolution No. 2H2 of the Board of Super
visors, approved December 27, 1001, directs
the Board of Public Works to notify all own
era, occupants and persons In control or pos
session of any buildings on this portion of
Third street to remove buildings and obstruc
tions within sixty days, except that the South
End Boat Club was granted an extension of
time to July 1, 1003.
A subsequent resolution of the Board ot
Supervisors, No. 2SW6, also refer* to the mat
ter of the removal of these obstructions, mak
ing Inquiry as to the action which the Board
of Public Works had taken In the premises.
As the time within which all obstructions
were to be removed has long since expired,
the boathouse, aa well as all other obstruc
tions, should be now removed without delay.
Youthful Marine Saved.
Juhn Fuller of Menominee, Wig

is being unlawfully restrained of his
liberty by P. C. Pope, commandant of
the marine barracks at Mare Islam!.

TISOOPS TOIt PANAMA.
Iiif;iiiir.vimii to Kellcve the Marines
at Present Stationed There.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 23.â Everything
is ready for the speedy consummation
of thf> Panama canal treaty, and both
the War and State Departments have
made preparations for the next step,
the former by the dispatch of troops to
the isthmus of Panama and the latter
by the completion of arrangements for
the exchange of ratifications of the
treaty, which must take place in Wash
ington. There is no reason why the
ceremony should not occur within the
next forty-eight hours. 13unau-Varilla,
the Minister from Panama, was at the
State Department to-day in relation to
this matter, and very soon after he has
made the exchange of the treaties he
will lay down his mission, according to
notice he has already given. His suc
cessor as Minister here will be Pablo
Arosemena. the present head of the
constitutional convention and the
father of the secretary of the Panama
legation here. Arosemena is described
as a lawyer of ability and a man of
mfÂ»anÂ«s *
The adminiFlration intends to press
the canal project by all proper methÂ»
ods. As a Cabinet official expressed it,
the next step after the appointment of
the commission will be to. "scratch
dirt," and already such members of the
commission as are assured of their
places, like Admiral Walker and Major
General Davis, have been giving some
attention to the provision of the cler
ical force and the engagement of en
gineering talent to conduct the actual
work of canal digging.
The War Department to-day, issued
orders for the entire Third Regiment of
infantry to proceed to the isthmus of
Panama.
The Regiment will leave at the earliest
possible time on the transports Sum
ner and McClellan from New York.
The regiment is going to Panama to
relieve the marines stationed there.
The headquarters of the regiment is
at Fort Thomas, Kentucky, where are
stationed Companies C, D, I, K, L and
M. At Fort Sheridan (Chicago) are
stationed. Companies A and B, and at
Columbus Barracks Companies E, F,
G and H. The regiment will be com
manded by Colonel Woodbury.
The War Department has in the past
strenuously denied reports that it in
tended to send troops to the isthmus,
but It is now explained that the state
ment only applied to conditions as they
existed before the United States ac
quired vested rights through the acqui
sition of the canal zone by the ratifica
tion of the canal treaty.
As the department has not satisfied
itself that this ratification is only a
question of a few hours it has taken
the necessary steps to permanently, gar
rison the isthmus, which could not be
easily done with marines.
The department announces that none
of the families of officers or enlisted
men of the Third Infantry would be
allowed to accompany the regiment.
In* the future, when permanent bar
racks and officers' quarters are con
structed on modern plans, this restric
tion may be removed.
The thousand marines now on the
isthmus will be taken to Guantanamo
as rapidly, as their places can be filled
<by the troops. From Guantanamo at
leapt a part of this -force will be taken
to the Philippines, probably coming to
the United States and embarking from
San Francisco for Manila.
It is intended that an adequate force
of marines shall be kept at Guanta
namo in case of probable emergencies
in Central and South America. Espe
cially is it desired that there shall be
a sufficient force there for the Govern
ment to call upon If it should under
take to execute a drastic programme
in Santo Domingo.
NEW YORK. Feb. The' "shake ui> >Â§ In
the police department, which has been expect
ed since the advent of the McClellan adminis
tration, tock Place to-day when three inspect
ors, eleven captains, one detective sergeant,
one Fereeant and two patrolmen were trans
ferred.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 24, 1904.
RING IS TOUCHED UP FOR THOUSANDS
BY THE VICTORY OF FIVE FAVORITES
Lord Melbourne a
Winner in the
Handicap.
It will be several days before the
bookmakers forget yesterday's array
of winners at Oakland. Twenty-five
books laid odds, and in the scramble
and competition for business good fat |
prices were Quoted, and the victory of
five out of six favorites cost the ring
more than $60,000.
For the layers' attacking forces
Caesar Young led off by carrying the
price about Hagerdon from evens . to
7 to 5. He painted the figures up in
oil colors, and Hagerdon won off by
himself. The 8 to 5 chalked against
Diderot was stretched out to 3, and
that gelding came galloping in first.
Next Caesar tried to knock down Lord
Melbourne, and most of his brother
pencilers were forced to go with him
or stand idle. He gradually boosted
the odds from even money to 7 to 5
and took in such a raft of coin that
the alarmists imagined the hearse and
floral pieces were waiting at the outer
track grate. The bookies met with as
much success knocking down the
choices as George Gardner did put
ting old freckled Bob Fitzsimmons
away.
BOOKIES ARE HEAVY LOSERS.
Among the big losers were: Caesar
Young, $8500; Johnny Lyons and "Wally
Brinkworth. $6600; Joe Rose, $4500; Joe
Harlan, $3300; Bill Jackman, $2700;
Lenox Club, $2500; Johnny Coleman,
$2000; Star Club, $2400; Paul Hoffman,
$2400; Herman Hoffman, $2500; Barney
Schreiber, $2200; Riley Grannan, who
held out the first three favorites, $1000;
Henry Wendt, $1100; Billy Engstroni,
$1200; Frank Lanterman, $1500; com
bination book, $1200; Jim Neil, $S00, and
"One-Two-Three" Martin, $450.
Sidney Bender picked up the six and
a half furlong handicap with Lord Mel
bcurne. His Lordship opened at even
money and despite the heavy play ac
corded him went back In the betting
to 7 to 5. There were but four starters
and Oliphant had waiting orders with
the favorite. Ananias and Futurita
cut out the running, the latter having
enough when the stretch was reached.
Oliphant now ?at down on Lord Mel
bourne and in a pretty three-head
finish with Captain Forsee and Ananias
gained the decision and the approval of
the crowd, which gave him quite
a. reception.
DALY'S CLEVER RIDE.
Johnny Daly handled Bard Burns to
perfection, and at 7 to 5 the chestnut
horse won the opening event from start
to finish. Mr. Farnum was the runner
up for two-thirds of the route and was
then outgamed and beaten for the place
by Pierce J. Both Pure Dale and Anvil
received scattering support and both
performed to no advantage.
Barring Oronte. the five and a half
furlong sprint looked a certainty for
Hagerdon. Notwithstanding this the
Frank gelding's price went from evens
to 7 to E. Oronte showed an inkling of
speed, but was never dangerous, Hager
don splashing in at will. In a driving
finish Narra G led Rlesc* 1 out for place
honors.
With a more experienced rider in the
saddle Constellator might have beaten
Diderot for the seven-furlong selling
number. Gruwell, who rode the former
horse, did fairly well, but lacked finish
ing qualities. The odds against Diderot
drifted back from 8 to 5 to 3. Buxton,
who piloted him, went out in the lead
and stayed there, downing Constellator
nearly three lengths. The Fretter was
hard pressed to beat Polonlus for the
show. Pruewood gave it up badly in
the stretch.
Jerry Roach astride Red Cross Nurse
made a runaway affair of the six-fur
long selling run, for three-year-olds.
The mare was held at odds of 3% to 1,
and won in a big gallop. Et Tu Brute,
which opened favorite, ran second, a
length ahead of George Berry. Hulford,
the post, favorite, with Travers up,-cut
no figure in the race ar" any time.
First Chip, also ridden by Roach,
duplicated the feat of Red Cross Nurse
in the final mile selling selection. Four
to five around post time, Chip sailed
away in front, winning pulled up from
Scherzo and Fille d'Or. Bungannon re
ceived steady backing, and after a hur
ried sortie fell to the rear.
Jerry Roach piloted two winners.
Formaster will be shipped to Los An
geles to run in the Derby. It is not
likely that the four California Derby
horses will meet here again in a spe
cial.
Harry Stover has a difficult time
keeping Pierce J in his barn. Not long
ago he was claimed by Ed Tierney, but
Harry got the gelding back by paying
an increase of $175. Yesterday F. L.
Caughey, owner of Formero, claimed
him out of the first race for $725.
Harry Robinson boosted First Chip
$600 over his entered selling price
of $500. E. Fitzgerald retained his horse
with a $5 bid.

Entertaining description and mag
nificent pictures combined to hold the
attention of the large audience at the
Young Men's Christian Association
Hall last evening which heard Rev.
Dr. Edgerton Young of Toronto, Can
ada, discuss "Indians; Their Habits,
Their Sports and Their Homes." Dr.
Young is a well known missionary,
traveler and author, who speaks from
the experience of many years spent
among the Indians of British America.
His travels have taken him from the
Great Lakes to Hudson Bay, the
Rocky Mountains to the Arctic Ocean.
His lecture last night dealt "in .pop
ular fashion with the Indians of the
Northwest, its'main theme being the
progress they have made, under the
conditions of modern. civilization from
the condition of savages living wholly
by the ' chase to that of settled culti
vators of the soil and supporters of
schools and churches. He gave amus
ing examples of Indian l6gic and hu
mor, of Indian music and of the ab
origines' mental quickness in copying
the costumes and customs of the
whites. The lecture was illustrated
Wy ' beautifully colored stereopticon
views. Dr. Young v closed his enter
tainment with a few striking views of
the aurora borealis.
"Journeyings Oft by Canoe and
JOLLY PIPERS
ARE FEATURE OF
KILTIES BAND
The gentleman that howled with the
Kilties' bagpipe last night at the Al
hambfa had the courage of other con
victions than his own. A good many of
us would have howled had we dared.
Honorary Pipe Major Albert Johnstone
is by no means the least of the Kilties'
attractions. He plays the bonny "kist
o' whistles" with a tripping gayety
truly Infectious and a positively Pade
rewski execution. His totre, or rather
drone, is â but Mr. Johnstone should be
heard to be believed.
The band itself is in fine fettle. There
are some excellent players among them,
and some beautiful instruments. Wil
liam F. Robinson, the leader, shows
himself, as last year, a thoroughly good
workman â and no musician. It is
averred of Mr. Robinson that he takes
off his coat at rehearsals; one wished
he would last night occasionally, even
if it had spoiled the fetching scheme
of tartan, kilt and cairngorm that the
Kilties present. But one is indebted to
the leader for a fine, precise drill, a
pure, good tone and excellent intona
tion. With these the Scotch things go
pretty much themselves, so what mat
ter if the Robirfsoned Mascagni be un-
convincing?
The Clan Johnstone troupe, consisting
of two featly-footed lasses and laddies,
contributes the best reel it has been
my luck to see, and the sword dancing
of Tom Johnstone is a bit of pedal
magic worth going a mile for. Further
variety is furnished by the Kilties'
choir, a tenor, J. Coates Lockhart, and
the tallest drum major in. the world,
who may be seen at the door.
Concerts will be given by the band
every afternoon and evening of this
week, Clan Caledonia to be in attend
ance this evening.

Mrs. Emma Napp fell from the
third story of her residence, 328 Third
street, last night, a distance of thirty
feet to the ground and escaped with
only a bruised shoulder. She had
stepped out on her balcony, which
â was slippery from recent rains. She
slipped and fell with such force
against the railing that she broke it
down and took it with her in her fall
to the yard below.
Mrs. Napp's son,. Nicholas, rushed to
her assistance and with the help of
the neighbors carried her up the
stairs, where it was thought she was
dead. Dr. Purlenky made an exam
ination and found she had escaped all
injury save the bruise and in half an
hour she had fully recovered and was
able to sit up without any effort.
Mrs. Napp is about 50 years of age
and , quite stout.

BETTORS FAVOR
YOUNG CORBETT
Install the Man From Denver
a One to Two Choice Over
Sullivan, His Next Opponent
WILL MAKE WEIGHT EASILY
His Trainers Give Assurance
That He Will Be at the
Required Notch on Monday
Young Corbett has had such a
string of victories on this coast during
the last year that the bettors appar
ently believe the man of his inches
who can defeat him has not yet ap-
peared on the scene.
In what wagering that has been
done on his meeting with Dave Sulli
van in Mechanics* Pavilion next Mon
day night the little champion is a
1 to 2 choice. It is expected the odds
will lengthen, as the men who bet In
thousands will undoubtedly be behind
the Denver boxer.
Dave Sullivan Is not without ad
mirers. Quite a crowd went over to
Croll's Gardens, Alameda, yesterday
to see him in action. Among the spec
tators \t-ere Spider Kelly and Harry
Corbett, who took a fancy to Sulli
van's style of boxing. He has a clever
left, which he lands unerringly and
with great force behind it. This blow
is expected to cause Young Corbett
some trouble until he develops some
guard against it. Sullivan Is being
trained b^y Jimmy Barry, once the
bantam-weight champion.
Out at Sheehan's, where. Toung
Corbett is working, it is all business.
The only semblance of recreation Is
when the .members of the camt> sit
down to pick the winners at Oakland.
Corbett is in great form at this game,
having won again yesterday. Tim Me-
Grath vouches for the champion's
weight, saying he will have no diffi
culty in reaching the required notch.
Cyclone Kelly and Billy Woods were
matched last night to fight fifteen
rounds before the Sequoia Club In
Oakland next month. They have
agreed to weigh in at 160 pounds at
3 o'clock. The forfeits of both men
have been posted with Harry Corbett.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
How I Cure Weak, Puny Men
Give me a man broken down from excesses, dissipation, boyish folly,
hard work or worry, from any cause which has sapped his vitality. Let
hfm fol?ow my advice for three months and I will make him as vigorous In
every respect as any man of his age. â¢
I will not promise to make a Hercules of a man who was never intended
by nature to be strong and sturdy. Even that man I can make better than
he Is; but the man who has been strong and has lost his strength I can
make' as good as he ever was.
I can give back to any man what he ha? lost by abuse of the laws of
nature. I can stop all drains upon the vital power In ten days.
A man who is nervous, whose brain and body are weak, who sleeps bad-
ly awakes more tired than when he went to bed, who is easily discouraged,
inclined to brood over imaginary troubles, who has lost ambition and en-
ergy to tackle hard problems, lacks the animal electricity which the Dr.
McLaughlin Electric Belt supplies.
The whole force of vitality in your body is dependent upon your animal
electricity. When you lose that by draining the system in any manner my
Belt will replace it and will cure you.
Mr. Harry U. Jackson, Valleton. Cal., write* Oct. 1: "Althouth you are a
stranger to me, my heart warms toward you as a great benefactor and friend, and I
am more than grateful to you. Already I can feel the vigor of new life In my body;
no aches and no pains. I wish you every success In your work."
Letters like that tell a story which means a great deal to a sufferer.
They are a beacon light to the man who- has become discouraged from use-
less doctoring. I get such letters every day.
My Belt has a wonderful influence upon tired, weak nerves. It braces
and invigorates them, and stirs up a great force of energy in a man.
I make the best electrical body appliance in the world, having devoted
twenty years to perfecting it. I know my trade. My cures after every-
thing else has failed are my best arguments.
&tr. Roy Burks. McKlttrlcks. Cal., writes: "FTom the first night I wore the belt
I felt new life In every part of my body. The drain stopped Immediately and I am
now able to do heavy work without tiring. I am arlad I thought of the belt, for In
no other way. could the money bring me so much pleasure."
Give me a man with pains in his back, a dull ache In his muscles or
joints, "come-and-go" pains In his shoulders, chest and side. Sciatica in
his hip. Lumbago. Rheumatism or any ache or pain, and my Belt will
pour the oil of life into his aching body and drive out every sign of pain.
No pain can exist where my Belt i3 worn. J
Mr. J. I* Balrd of Orland, Cal.. writes October I3th: "My back la entirely well,
and I would not take $10O for my belt if I could not get another. It Is the best
thing on earth for a lame back."
They come every day from everywhere. There is not a town or hamlet
in the country which has not cures by Dr. McLaughlin' s Electric Belt.
Now, what does this mean to you. dear reader? If you are not what you
ought to be, can you ask any better proof to make you try It? Is there a
remedy which is as .simple, as easy to use, as sure to cure, and as cheap as
Dr. MeLaughlin's Klectric Relt^flatiave not seen one. You must try it. In
Justice to yourself, and to those wno look to you for their future happi-
ness, try it now. Act this minute. Such a matter ought not to be delayed.
It's as good for women as for. men. "Worn while you sleep, it causes
â  no trouble. You feel the gentle, glowing heat from it constantly, but no
sting, no burning, as in old-style belts.
Send for my beautiful book, full of things a man likes to read if he
wants to be a strong man. I send it, sealed, free. Cut out this ad.

CHICAGO, Feb. 23.â The Inter Ocean
to-day eays: Mme. Eleonora PetrelH,
once a world-renowned opera singer
and widow of Prince von Petroff of
Russia, a>d in an obscure hotel in Chi
cago, alone and in want save for the
charity of strangers.
Daughter and heiress of one of the
wealthiest Counts of Scandinavia, this
wonderful woman lived to see two great
fortunes melt away and to have her
title of royalty taken from her. Driven
by necessity to sing for a living in the
royal opera companies of the continent,
the singer won her way upward in the
profession, until at the Russian court
in St. Petersburg she became the wife
of Prince von Petroff, a Boyar noble-
JTian. Then began the series of misfor
tunes which eventually left her adrift
as a poor' teacher of music in Chicago
at the age of 87 years.
The singer had won fame under the
name of Mme. Petrelli in three royal
opera companies. The name was as
sumed for stage purposes and is Italian
for Petroff, the name of her royal hus
band. Her father was the Count Wei
gant of Sweden. Her mother was the
Countess von Schwerin. Mme. Petrelli's
name when a child was Eleanore Wci
pant. She was descended in a direct
line from the Grand Duke t>f Mecklen
burg and the Rev. Dr. Count von
Schworin. at one time the most noted
man in Scandinavia.

DOCTORS SWEAR
TO HIS SANITY
Medical Men Say De Labrousse,
Slayer of Miss Jordan, Was
Not Insane at Time of Crime
TESTIMONY IS ALL IX
District Attorney and Counsel
for Defense Close Cases and
Argument Begins To-Day
The trial of Edmond de Labrousse
for the murder of Miss Marie Jordan
was resumed In Superior Judge
Dunne's court yesterday. The whole
of the day was taken up by witnesses
called in rebuttal by District Attorney
Byin^ton and Assistant District At
torney Whiting.
Evidence for the most part was
forthcoming- to establish the san
ity of the prisoner, the witnesses be
ing nurses and medical men that had
attended De Labrousse after the com
mission of the murder and policemen
that had guarded him.
Mrs. Rose Kane, matron, Mrs. W.
E. Swett and Miss A. Hart, nurses at
the Central Emergency Hospital,
swore that De Labrousse was rational
while under treatment in the hospital,
and neither of the witnesses had
heard him scream or cry, and there
was nothing that attracted their at
tention to his case more than any
other patient. When they passed the
time of day he would reply.
Miss Hart said that the prisoner
_ i seemed to her to be perfectly rational.
J Policemen James Harrington. W.
; I Quarles. H. M. Owens. J. J. Farrell, K.
. J. Plume, P. Crowley. C. Francis,
; John McGee and P. J. O'Donnell tes
tified to having had the several
watches over the prisoner from the
| time of his admission to the hospital
until his removal to the City Prison.
They swore that De Labrousse was
rational and spoke not only to them
but also to the members of his family
while in the hospital. To the latter
I the conversation was in French.
SAY JlE WAS RATIONAL.
District Attorney Byington called
the medical men that attended the
j prisoner duriner his confinement in the
| Central Emergency Hospital, their
j evidence being- a direct contradiction
i to that given by Dr. Edwin Bunnell
I and Dr. Canac-Marquis.
Dr. W. P. Harvey, who was one of
j the surgeons at the hospital, swore
j that De Labrousse was perfectly ra
j tional so far as he could see. He
j never saw Dr. Bunnell present when
j the wounds were being dressed. Dr.
i C. F. Miller testified to the prisoner
i being rational while at the hospital.
j Witness had never heard him scream
I nor cry out.
! Dr. Thomas T. Maher said that the
j prisoner answered his questions co
| herently when he saw him at the hos
| pltal.
Charles C. Butcher, steward of the
1 Central Emergency Hospital, told of
,' having- dressed the prisoner's head
;' several times. To the witness he ap
\ peared rational. He was conscious
j when taken to the hospital.
The District Attorney called Dr.
; Charles C Wadsworth as an expert
I and put a hypothetical question to the
> witness, in which he reviewed some
i of the prisoner's actions up to the
! time of the murder.
In answer to the question Dr.
I Wadsworth said, decisively, "In my
j opinion he was sane."
GIVE EXPERT TESTIMONY.
The District Attorney then asked
; Dr. Wadsworth whether there was any
. such term as "madly insane," to which
â¢ the witness replied, "There is no such
I term."
Detective Reynolds was called and
i swore that Dr. Bunnell stated to him
j that 1t was a very serious wound, but
that De Labrousse did not feel it and
that he \vas unconscious when on the
j operating table.
Dr. D. D. Lustig told of the years he
j had devoted to insanity cases and of
his holding the position of examiner of
the insane. The same hypothetical
j question as asked Dr. Wads worth was
i put to Dr. Lustig by the District At
torney, and in reply the witness said
firmly, "In my opinion the prisoner waa
pane." Witness said also that he had
never heard the term "monomania mel
ancholia."
The District Attorney then read the
hypothetical question Mr. Roche, coun
sel for defendant, had asked Dr. Bun
nell and Dr. Canac-Marquis, and In re
ply Dr. Lustig said, "In my opinion he
was sane and would know the differ
ence between right and wrong."
A KEMAHKABLE ADMISSION*.
Dr. C. F. Buckley was called by At
torney Roche in sur-rebuttal, and in re- i
ply to the question, "Could a man at- j
tend to business of any kind while en- j
tirely insane?" Dr.- Buckley answered I
in the affirmative, and said further that i
he knew a medical man that had at- i
tended to his practice for a year during '
which time he was insane. i
District Attorney Byington asked the i
witness whether while fnsane a doctor j
cculd practice medicine. i
Dr. Buckley replied, "Yes, and prac- j
! tice law, too, and better t,han some that i
are sane."
The District Attorney asked Dr. '
Buckley for the name of the medical i
practitioner that practiced while in- j
sane, but the doctor replied, "I cannot i
give the name, for the reason that he
is practicing now."
The witness gave it as his opinion
that De Labrousse was insane before !
the murder. ;
Mrs. Elizabeth Schleber and Miss Ju
lia Anthus had met the prisoner at a
party at Mr. and Mrs. P. Bennet's. on
Larkin street, during the month of Sep- j
tember, at which time they considered :
him rational. W. Jackson, A. L. Bur- i
row, F. G. Shallenberg, R. W. Burke, I
Harvey Long and Paul Hay also gave j
testimony, in which they grave it as >
their opinion that the prisoner was ra- I
tional before the commission of the
crime.
The District Attorney and Mr. Roche
announced that all the evidence was!
in, and an adjournment was taken un
til this morning, when the argument for
the prosecution will be made.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. WEDNESDAY. FEBRUARY 24, 1904.
POLICE JUDGE HEARS TALE
OF BATTLE OF THE BREAD
Flinty Loaves and Stringy Spaghetti Fly in Restaurant
Where Men and Maidens Gather to Celebrate Birth of
Country's Father â Sacking of Troy Lived Over Again
Judge Conlan's court rang with the
tale of a fiercer battle yesterday than
any that is likely to occur on the Yalu.
It will go down into history as the
Battle of the Bread. Plowshares have
been turned into swords every once
in a while, but the stunt' of making
the staff of life into a munition of war
is an innovation and noteworthy.
This is the tale that Judge Conlan
heard from survivors: There were fif
teen men and maidens seated at a
table at Luchetti's on Washington's
birthday singing 'The Land I Love Is
Bohemia â la â ia." At a near by
festal board sat nine men and maidens.
While the fifteen were making
merry suddenly there rose the slogan
of "Abas le Bohemia!" from the nine.
The fifteen were as unprepared as the
Russians at Port Arthur and before
they could throw up hasty entrench
ments of soup plates or prepare an
ambuscade behind the celery the nine
made a flank movement. A volley of
petrified Latin quarter French bread
created havoc among the fifteen. They
went under the table unanimously.
Jack Rice of Judge Conlan's court
was close to the melee, but remember
ing the advice of Washington, refrain
ed frorr/ entangling foreign alliances.
He crawled into a plate of Roquefort
cheese, and secure in that strong de-
fense watched the battle from afar.
H. Mulhall of the unfortunate fif
teen, who was wounded in the head
by the first volley of loaves, emerged
during a lull and demanded apologies.
His comrade, Robert Jeffries, stood be
side him and seconded his ultimatum.
A bomb of Rissotto smote the gallant
Jeffries In the eye and spattered over
his uniform.
One of the nine then ran forward to
reconnoiter and Mulhall and Jeffries
fell upon him, rendering him hors du
combat with well directed firing of
pate de foie gras and macaroni.
At this juncture the powers, that is
to say, the police interceded. They

When Judge Conlan heard the ballad
of battle he summoned the battered
veterans before him. "It was certainly
befitting to celebrate the birthday erf

Tho Sixteenth and Mission Street Fur
niture House Seems to Be Doing
All the Furniture Business
in This City.
Since the great retiring sale started
at Pattosien's it seems all the furni
ture, carpet and drapery buyers are go
ing to that big store. Orders are coming
in from all parts of the State, even from
Oregon, Nevada and Washington, to fit
out beautiful homed. In this city there
is hardly a house which does not
either buy some odd pieces of fur
niture or fit out new the entire home.
The' public sees with Its own eyes the
wonderful reductions being made. Of
course there is a big stock to be sold in
spite of the big run the store Is having.
Every day new stock is replaced from
the warehouse for that which has been
sold. Just now the prices at other stores,
particularly Installment houses, are 50
per cent hipher. When Pattosien's store
will close the doors prices will at least
rise 75 per cent higher. This is the rea
son why the big crowds come daily to
Pattosien's. corner Sixteenth and Mis
sion streets. â¢
Slakes False Representations.
J. H. O'Connor was arrested yes
terday by Detectives Bunner and Freel
and charged with' obtaining money by
false pretenses. On February 17
he went to the Jepsen Bros.' Com
pany, â¢ harness manufacturers, at
1145 Market street, and : said he
had been sent by Nathan Dohrmann
& Co. for two whips. He got them
and returned next day and got a whip
and a duster. Last Saturday he got
other articles and when he made his
appearance yesterday the detectives
were on hand and arrested him. On
January 13 he got a lot of poultry from
Lemoyne & Co. by false representa
tion and was arrested, but the case
â¢was dismissed. .
Xapa Gets a War Relic.
NAPA, Feb. 23. â The steamer Zin,

partment at Washington.

"Go, take your murderous loaves and

The war of the bread is over."
It was a Grecian holiday. Whether
or not it was the sack of Troy they
were celebrating or the battle at Ther
mopylae does not appear. At any rate
twelve of them found themselves in
the narrow pass known as "Howard
court," which lies between Howard and
Xatoma streets. Deeply they drank of
Falernian wine and the old-time war
spirit was revived. Again they beat
Xerxes back from forbidden shores and
ruled an olive bearing sand dune,
"laughing tearfully," as Homer says.
One lone policeman took them in tow
for disturbing the peace. He was not
historically sane, but he knew his duty
when the neighboring tenement win
dows held myriad heads, wondering
what the trouble was.
All the defendants were discharged
by Judge Cabanlss yesterday with an
injunction that although Marathon
looks on the sea the children born un
der her shadow have no more privileges
than ordinarily accrue to the plainest
American citizen.
Roy B. Freeman is the "lookout kid."
When he gets his auger to work noth
ing is hidden from him. He rented a
room from Mrs. G. H- Horn, who con
ducts the Washington Hotel. When he
secured his apartments he proceeded
to bore holes in the floor so that he
might see what was going on below.
The landlady found shavings on the
floor and a keen eye glued to an apert
ure in the ceiling and she had her
lodger arrested for malicious mischief
because he defaced the floor of his room
with punctures. Judge Fritz found him
guilty and will sentence him to-day.
Cassius Crosby is in trouble again.
He is a notorious room-prowler, and by
virtue of a smug face and a moneyed
father has escaped conviction on sev
eral charges of burglary. His latest
escapade was to Invade a room on
Kearny street and secure the valuables
the obcupant possessed. For this he
was arrested and released on $25 bail.
When tho Judge heard the circum
stances he ordered the defendant into
custody and raised the bail to $2000.
REFUSES TO DECLARE
THE CONTRACT INVALID
Supreme Court Snys Selby Oppen-
Iieimer Jlust Stand by Hi* Agree
ment With Thomas Clunie.
The Supreme Court has decided that
Selby Oppenhelmer must stand by the
contract he made with Thomas Clu
nie to pay $550 a month for* five years
for the use- of the-Olunf* Opera-house
in Sacramento. The lease was con
summated in December, 1900. A year
later Oppenheimer was sick of his
bargain and commenced action to
have . the contract declared void.
He alleged that Clunie had misrep
resented the condition of the theater
to him. He asserted that the house
was not constructed so as to comply
with the fire ordinances and that the
stairways were rotten and unsafe.
The lower court decided in his favor
and appear was taken by Clunie..
The Supreme Court declares that
Oppenheimer had plenty of opportun
ity to find out all about the theater
and that therefore, he is not entitled
to any redress. The rental for five
years at the rate mentioned in the
contract is $33,000.

gone so far as to send back the pres
ents she sent the boy at Christmas
time.

Thjs Is the first announcement of the subdi-
vision of a portion of the well known Jordan
Tract.
Go and 6ee this block at once and secure
your choice. It is near ttte corner of First ave.
and California st. and can be easily reached by
taking either the Eddy-st. cars or the Sacra-
mentc-st. cars and get off at First ave.
Easy terms â one-flfth cash.
Kasy terms â one-flfth cash.
Balance in 1. 2, 3 and 4 years â one-flfth each
year.
The block is exceptionally handsome and Is
level. The streets are graded, macadamized
and fewered. and everything ready fcr the
builder. A new feature has been inaugurated
in the sale of this property in the enforcement
of the following restrictions, which are made
for the protection of all and which, we have
no doubt, will add much to the value of the
land and be appreciated by all real home seek-
ers.
No lot will be sold for any but residence
properties, including' not more than two flats.
No stores, churches, ctables. coal yards or
any objectionable buildings. The manner of
enforcing these restrictions will be- explained
fully at our office.
The Idea Is to make it possible for you to buy
a lot .and build a home without being ruined
or damaged by neighboring buildings. Thou-
sands of people in this city who have built de-
sirable homes have had them ruined by three-
story flats, stores, coal yards, etc. Owing to
the restrictions and the large lots, this block
will be built up into select residence property
and will become very valuable.
It will pay you to buy a large lot instead of
a 25-foot lot. as you can save the price of the
extra land In the cost of your building, and be-
sides this secure an abundance of light and
sun and build a more artistic home.
Our agent will be on thÂ» block Sunday with
diagram, cr you may call at our office for
more complete information. But take our ad-
vice and see the property at once.

QUARREL OVER CHILD
SETTLED OUT OP COURT
Mr. and Mrs. Wisdom AgrcÂ« That
Th< ir Little Girl Shall Remain In
Alameda Convent.
Judge Kerrigao was called upon yes
terday to decide who was the proper
person to have the care and custody
of- little Roberta Emma Wisdom, the
child of Ida E. and W. M. Wisdom.
The mother wants the little one and
the father, who has had her in his
care for the last nine months, would
Jike to have her also. He refused to
give her up and he was haled before
Judge Kerrigan on a writ of habeas
corpus.
The little girl was with him when
he entered the court. He also had a
large box of candy and to this the lit
tle one clung with almost as great a
display of affection as she gave to her
'ather. When her mother appeared
5he ran to her, remained a few min
utes and then returned to her father â
and the candy. Judge Kerrigan con
tinued the case until late in the after
noon, and when the couple and the
little one returned an order was made
directing that until the further order
of the court the child should remain
in a convent in Alameda and that the
parents were to have every oppor
tunity to visit her. The order was
made at the request of Wisdom and
his wife.

SEVEN FIRMS AFFECTED
Renewal of Trouble Between
Tallymen's Union No. 225
and Building Trades Council
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway. Feb. 23.
The Longshoremen's Union was
called out on strike to-day to enforce
the demands of the union relating to
the work to be done by the Lumber
Clerks' Union (tallymen). The long
shoremen claim that the tallymen* have
been doing work which properly 'be
longs to the members of the Longshore
men's Union, and they demand that the
tallymen sign an agreement limiting
their work to taljying and that they
affiliate with the International Long-
Ehoremen's Association of America,
The Lumber Clerks' Union, which is
affiliated with the Building Traded
Council, has refused to accede to the
demands of the longshoremen and in
consequence the latter were ordered
out on strike this morning to compel
the employers to force their men into
the longshoremen's organization. Busi
ness Agent- X. T. Nelson saya that the
union of which he is the representative
is in the right and that its members
are prepared to stay out until the Lum-
ber Clerks' Union is brought to terms.
Seven of the local lumber yards are
affected by the strike. They are the
E. B. and A. L. Stone Lumber Com
pany, the Bay Shore Lumber Company,
the Humboldt Lumber Company, the
Taylor Lumber Company, the Derby
Lumber Company, the Puget Sound
Lumber Company and the Pacific Coast
Lumber Company. T'r â¢ strike involves
nearly three hundred lumber handlers.

WORRY LAW OFFICERS
Alameda Police Kept Busy by Gang
of Housebreakers That Continues
Active Operations.
ALAMEDA. Feb. 23.â Burglars and
ihieves continue active here, despite
the efforts of the police to prevent their
illegal work, and reports of robberies
and housebreaking are of daily and
nightly record. During the last four
days no less than ten houses have been
entered and various articles stolen,
principally rings, watches, jewelry and
silverware. In most of these thefts
the work has been done while the mem
bers of the hcmsehold were absent. En
trance has generally been obtained
through the breaking of windows and
glass door panels, and it is the theory
of the police that the burglaries were
committed by members of an organ
ized gang of crooks.
Included in the list of places that
have been visited by thieves are the
residences of Mrs. R. B. Branch, 1713
Santa Clara avenue; Mrs. Gus Koch,
1315 San Antonio avenue; Peter Mar
tinoni, 1019 Railroad avenue; J. A.
Meyer, 1536 Verdi street; L. W. Spear,
1306 Sherman street; A. M. Lusk, 1617
Clinton avenue. In addition to the
house robberies there has been a night
hold-up within the last four days, in
which Miss Kate Cronin was attacked
and knocked down by an assailant,
who attempted to snatch her purse.

SAILORS IN GRIP OF FEVER AND AGUE
ARE UNABLE TO HANDLE THE VESSEL
British Ship Celtic Queen From Acapulco' for Wallaroo Sighted a
Month Ago Within 400 Miles of Destination With All Hands
Sick â Captain Refuses Help â Arrival Not Yet Reported
Not a little anxiety is felt for the
safety of the British ship Celtic Queen,
which left Acapulco November 12 for
Wallaroo and was last heard of Janu
ary 18 within 400 miles of her destina
tion with all hands suffering from fever
and ague. She was spoken on that date
by the steamer Lady Mildred fifty miles
east of Cape Otway. The windjammer
was under easy sail, and Captain Wil
liams of the Celtic Queen reported that
all hands were suffering from fever and
ague contracted in the Central Ameri
can port and for the time being were
unable to handle the sails or otherwise
assist in the navigation of the vessel.
The Lady Mildred's offer of assistance
was refused, but Captain Williams
asked that his plight be reported. It is
now more than a month since the Celtic
Queen was spoken, and no word has
been received of her arrival at Wal
laroo.
Sailor Discovers Leak.
The Norwegian bark Rokeby Hall, which
put In here February 2 in distress, is ready
to resume her voyaging. Since her arrival
marine surveyors and ship carpenters have
searched in vain to locate the serious leak
which let In enough water to keep the pumps
constantly busy, it was decided to drydock
the vessel for a further examination and this
would have been don? had not one of the
crew discovered that the calking had fallen
out of one of Ihe lumber ports and left open
quite a chink lor the inpouring of the green
salt sea. ThU was the leak and a handful
of oakum <lrivcn tightly home has put the
leaking Rokeby Hall into seaworthy condition
again.
Diver Finds One Blade Gone.
A diver made an examination yesterday of
the steamship Sierra's propeller and found
that one blade had been snapped off close to
the hub. So far as could be seen this Is the
lull extent cf the damage sustained by the
liner in her encounter with whatever sub
marine obstacle tshe struck on Sunday night.
The Sierra was taken to Hunters Point yes
terday afternoon and this morning, with the
hull clear of water., a careful survey will
l>e made, a rew propeller put on and what
ever else may be fou^d amiss will be repaired.
It is thought that clinging to hull or wheel
may be found seme clew as to the nature of
the obstacle that crossed the liner's path.
Whether log. derelict or whale, however, the
damage done to the steamer seems to have
been slight.
tVill Be a Total Loss.
The last report received from the ship Henry
B. Hyde, which went ashore February 11 at
Dam Neck, ten miles south of Cape Henry,
was -that the vessel was burying herself In
the sand and appeared to be a hopeless wreck.
The passing of the Henry B. Hyde removes
another familiar sailing vessel from the fl>et
having a home port at San Francisco. The
Hyde was built in 1884 at Bath, Me., and
had all the grace of hull and spar for which
the American built ship has long been fa
mous. She was owned by the California
Shipping Company, of which W. B. Mlghells
is president. This company carries Its own
insurance and no vessels are ' maintained In
Letter condition than those flying either the
private flag of W. B. Mighells or the bunting
Kign of the California Shipping Company.
AVhen wrecked the Henry B. Hyde was on
her way from New York to Baltimore to
load coal for this port.
Will Tow to Antwerp.
Ths British yhlp Matterhorn. which left here
September 1Â« for Antwerp and reached Dover
a few days ago, damaged through having col
lided with the steamship Lake Michigan, has
been surveyed and will be towed to her des
tination. Although extensive the damage was
all above the water line.

GOOD PROMISE
San Francisco and Interior
Hold Conference Which Has
.a Very Favorable Outcome
MONEY NEEDED FOR SHOW
All Commercial Bodies Will
Help to Raise Sum Wanted
to l Provide for an Exhibit
Representatives of the executive com
mittee of the Sacramento Valley De
velopment Association secured a prom
ise yesterday from presidents and other
representatives of commercial organi
zations in this city of support to raise
the money needed to adequately install
the collective exhibit of the Sacramento
Valley counties at St. Louis. What the
committee wanted was to get San
Francisco to contribute the sum of $6000
to have the Sacramento Valley counties
put in shape to place a great exhibit,
to publish 100,000 copies of a Sacra
mento Valley book descriptive of the
entire valley, to have representatives
at St. Louis for every one of the Sac
ramento Valley counties and to meet
euch other expenses as may arise and
are not already provided for.
It did not need much argument to
convince those that were present as
representatives of the San Francisco
commercial organizations that to ad
vertise the Sacramento Valley properly
at St. Louis was advantageous to San
Francisco. Action indicating this was
taken very soon after the meeting was
fairly in motion.
The first actual subscription to aid
the Sacramento Valley came from
Arthur R. Briggs, who agreed to put
up $25 personally. He said that the
California State Board of Trade, of
which he is the manager, could not do
nate any money as a body, but that it
would help all that it could. Before
the meeting adjourned it was voted to
have a committee of the secretaries of
the commercial organizations, who are
Messrs. Fletcher of the State Board of
Trade, King of the Merchants' Asso
ciation, Friedlander of the Merchants'
Exchange, Scott of the Chamber of
Commerce. Bancroft of the Manufac
turers' and Producers' Association and
Smith of the San Francisco Board of
Trade, go around with a committee
from the Sacramento Valley to call
upon San Francisco merchants to get
subscriptions. This Is â  to be done at
once. As soon as convenient the boards
of directors of the commercial organiza
tions of the city will be called together
to take such action as they may see fit.
GREEX GIVES FACTS.
General W. S. Green, president of
the Sacramento Valley Development
Association, said that he expected that
the co-operation of the commercial
bodies of the city would result in rais
ing some money. It had been con
sidered that $6000 was the share of San
Francisco. The Sacramento Valley be
gan only thirty-flve miles from San
Francisco and was therefore in the door
yard of San Francisco. The commercial
advantage of having the Sacramento
Valley known to the world aa well as
were Los Angeles and the counties In
the south of the State was apparent
and San Francisco would appreciate it.
What Los Angeles was to the southern
counties San Francisco ought to be
to the counties in this part of the State.
He promised to appoint a committee
to co-operate with the committee of
San Francisco secretaries mentioned In
the foregoing.
The initial motion to have action
taken by the San Francisco commer
cial bodies came from Andrea Sbar
boro, president of the Manufacturers'
and Producers' Association. An In
vitation was extended by Mr. Sbarboro
on behalf of the California Promotion
Committee to use the committees
rooms as' headquarters In the work to
be undertaken on behalf of the val
ley. Mr. Sbarboro said that he would
request of Mr. Jennings, the executive
officer of the promotion committee, to
lend assistance. Remarks were made
by A. A. Watkins, who presided; G.
W. McNear, General W. S. Green,
Secretary Beard of the Sacramento
Valley Development Association and
J. G. Martine, commissioner for the
city of Sacramento to the St. Louis
Exposition. '.-,â  .'.',' . 51
EXHIBIT IS EXTENSIVE.
Some of the facts that were stated
were already *of common knowledge.
It was set forth by the speakers from
the valley 4 that the city of Sacramento
had subscribed one-third of the fund
of $30,000 that it was found necessary
to raise; that tr>e valley show sur
passed any that had ever been at
tempted of a "similar kind, the bulk
being in processed fruits and vege
tables; that the counties that would
make the collective valley show at
St. Louis included Sacramento, Sola
no, # Placer, Yolo, Tuba, Sutter, Colu
sa, Butte. Glenn, Tehama, El Dorado
and probably Shasta.
Those present were W. S. Green of
Colusa, Secretary Board, C. F. Foster
of Tehama County, J. G. Martine of
Sacramento, John Relth Jr.- of Wood
land, R, M. Green of Oroville.i H. P.
Stabler of Yuba City, State Senator
Diggs of Marysville. Fred M. Buck of
Vacaville and, from the commercial
bodies of this city, Messrs. A. A .Wat
kins, Arthur R. Briggs, A. Sbarboro,
Rufus P. Jennings and G. W. McNear.

chase, giving the excuse that he had
found that the title to the property
was defective.

New York Stock Market
NEW YORK. Feb. 23.â A good start against
depression was made by the stock market this
morning, but the tone became nervous ana ap
prehensive as the day wore on, and in the
afifrncon there was positive weakness. The
relative share In causing this weakness be
tween the several factors In evidence v.as not
very clear. Some of the early improvement
ha<i its impetuÂ« from foreign sources, where
thÂ» success of yesterday in calming the
panicky conditions on the Paris bourse was
iullowed by some rebound. The concentrated
nature of the selling indued some fears that
large interests were liquidating their holdings.
The suspense fflt ever the coming Northern
Securities dcclrion was an important Influence
tn thi- market, and there i"-as room for the
opinion held by some persons that it was the
dominant. Influence. Wall strtet was entirely
at sea during the morning as to what to ex
ix-ct on tht- subject. London reported a belief
that the derision would bt- handed down to
day and wouiil favor the company. When the
rtjjort was recfived that court decisions were
lÂ»t-ing delivered thÂ«* market showed the great
'â¢Â«t weaknf-^s of the whole diy. In sympathy
with a br>rak of 2* 4 in Northern Securities it
self, vn th.Â± curb. Un'asinPFS over the foreign
j financial situation wag revived by the report of
j an Important banking failure in Berlin, and
j thÂ» strength in the local exchange market
1 gave color to the doubts felt. It is realized
! that Euror* is not stripped of American se
! curitief. however large the recnt reductions
I in thÂ» floating rapfdjr there may have been.
â  Extensive financial disturbances In Europe
I would be sure to precipitate pressure upon tlie
I wortS*a strongest financial point, which seems
I to be New Yr.rk at present. The influx of cash
I into New York, which is making it so strong,
\ Is viewed â¢OtneWhmt dubiously, taken in con
1 nection with the decline in railroad earnings
I anJ the shrinkage in the country's bank plear
inÂ»rs, pointing to a decrease in business activ
ity.' which If â  not wholly reassuring. The
pendency of the vote on the Panama canal
irppty pointed to an farly call by the Secretary
of th<Â» Treasury for a portion of Government
deposits in nHtional banks. A further cut in
thf Lake rate ]/Â»iU alive apprehensions over
the war of rate?. The market closed at about
thf lowÂ»6t of th<Â» day and showed losses rang
ing from 1 to l*i points. Southern Pacific '
was thf- moFt actively pressed for rale, and a
number of dormant stocks made violent de
cline*. .

Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, Feb. 23.â Wild excitement
marked trading in the wheat pit from the
very start. Buying orders appeared -to come
from all directions at the opening. The cause
v.'as sharp advances in foreign grain markets.
A rumor that the English neet had been or
dered to Intercept any attempt by the Russian
fleet to pass the Dardanelles furnished an ad
ditional motive to many traders. The May de
livery was In more active demand than the
deferred futures and as a result initial sales
on that option were at an advance of %c to
2%c over Saturday's closing figure at $1 00*4
to ?1 OHM. The wide ranse of prices showed
more plainly than anything else the excite
ment under which the market opened. Soma
brokers were bidding Jl 08^ a bushel for
wheat, while others almost . by their sides
were selling, that commodity for 2c a bushel
less. The volume of trading the last few min
utes was enormous. Hundreds of thousands
of bushels were sold on the advance and on
this heavy profit taking- the price of May fell
an even 4c from tile high point to $1 02Vi.
July declined to 94%c, or l%c from the top.
Many stop-loss orders were reached on the
way down, which added to . the weakness.
Shorts in the May j option took advantages of
the break to cover, and the buying from thU
pource caused a recovery to SI 06 >Â£. Within
the last fifteen minutes another flood of selling
orders appeared in the pit. The result of this
renewed attack was a break in May to
$1 03Vi. a decline of S&c from the high point.
July sold off to 92V&C, a loss of 3%c. Tha
close was weak, with May at $1 04. . July
closed at 93Hc
Corn was traded in heavily and prices moved

Oats were exceedingly nervous and the vol
' ump of business was somewhat restricted. May
opened unchanged to %c higher at 45Tic to
46c, and after ranging between 44%c and
4014c, closed at 44ftc. -
Provisions were excited In the same degree
as the grain markets. The opening was wild
with prices strong, but a general rush on the
- part of the holders to realize caused a de
cline. May Pork showed the greatest weak-
J ness and declined 45c from the top. mark.

were higher, supplies being scanty and
controlled by a few dealers. Same
j dealers were asking $1 20 per cental
j for choice river Burbanks on the wharf.

were reported at $1 35 per ctl. Two cars of

few dealer*, who were firm In their views, and
both Oregon and Nevadan were firmly held at
higher rates. The steamer clue from Oregon
to-day will bring 10S0 sacks.

declined sharply. Three boxes of Rhubarb

being no Western offering and the receipts of

WORK OF CHARITY BOARD IS FULLY
DISCUSSED AT ANNUAL CONFERENCE
Last Day's Sessions of* Third- Yearly. Meeting Brings Forth Number
of Interesting Talks and Papers on Subject of Juvenile Crim
inals and the Deplorable Condition of State Institutions
The third annual State Conference of
the California Board of Charities and
Corrections came to a close Jast night
at the First Unitarian' Church. A
more brilliant session, replete as
it was with interesting papers
on scientific subjects and subjects of
general interest concerning the State
institutions of California, has never
been held by the organization.
Some of the most eminent students of
medicine, heads of charitable and pub
lic institutions and Organizations, law
yers, ministers and members of the
bench took part in the convention, pre
senting to the assemblage addresses and
papers on subjects of wide interest. The
aim of the convention was to secure
information as to the best way in
which to govern charitable organiza
tions and institutions, yublic institu
tior*-f houses of correction, hospitals
and :>Iaces of confinement for the crim
inal classes. Much discussion was had
Â«n the subject of the child criminal,
how to curb the criminal instincts in
the young and how to reform them
after their incarceration resulting from
some criminal act.
Able papers, addresses and discussions
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 24/ 1904.
THREE OF THE LEADING SPEAKERS AT THE CLOSING DAY'S SES
SIONS OF THE ANNUAL STATE CONFERENCE OF CHARITIES
AND CORRECTIONS.
were given on the subjects of juvenile
offenders and juvenile courts. The City
and County Hospital came in for a
vigorous censure, and the condition oi
the jails of the State was the theme
for much discussion. The members ol
the conference listened to some instruc
j tive papers on these various subjects
and are now equipped with the neces
sary information to go forth and pre
vent or minimize to some extent these
evils as they exist in California.
AIMS OF ASSOCIATION'..
Yesterday morning was given over to
a discussion on "Associated Charities
Problems" by representatives of the As
sociated Charities of the State. Paulina
Wetzlar Dohrmann read an interesting
paper. In part it was as follows:
Our aim was and is to relieve all deserving
cas*s of destitution and. If possible, by en
couraging thrift and industry, raise the needy
above the need of relief; to prevent indiscrim
inate and duplicate alms-giving; to reduce pau
perism and vagrancy; to make employment the
basis of relief, so that, wherever possible the
needy may be made self-sustaining and eelf
rrsptcting, the children to work rather than
loaf and beg.
To sccomplisli this requires not only the
co-operatUn of the different benevolent so
cieties and the Board of Supervisors, but' the
Individual support of all who are - interested
in the work of relieving deserving cases' and
exposing and preventing relief of the impos
tors and undeserving.
Our field Is bread, our work one which re
quires constant watchfulness and energy. Our
methods are briefly as follows: , '
AVe investigate thoroughly all applications
for relief and in cases requiring immediate ac
tion grant BU'jh relief fittingly and promptly..
I3y investigation we ascertain the cause of
distress and, if possible, try to remove . the
samÂ«, to make thÂ» dependent Independent.
We keep a record of all oases Investigated,
showing result of such investigation and cause
of destitution, and expose deception and fraud.
That there be no misconception I In regard
to the distribution of the county, funds let
me state that we are not an organization of
consolidated, charities to divide the county,
money, but to control and oversee (by co-'
opeiation) 'Its Judicious distribution; : so that
the best result may be obtained with a'nitn-'
Imum amount, and the chronic . indolent" and
poorâ the impostorsâ exposed and denied.
Emma Ross Gilman of Santa Bar
bara andseveral other leading workers
for charity from different parts of the
State took part In, the discussion.
W. Almont Gates, secretary of the
California State Board of Charities and
Corrections, at the afternoon i session
delivered an excellent paper on "State
Boards of Charities and Corrections."
In part it was as follows: â¢
WORK OF CHARITY BOARD
Members of State Boards of Charities are :
appointed by ; the Governor, they draw no
Â«ali.ry and have no patronage, hence the places
are not sought for by politicians. For-, these,
reasons uninent men. willing to. give their
time in the interests of humanity, have .filled
these boards. Their duties are:
First â To investigate tne whole system of
char!Ue3 â¢ and corrections in the State.
Second â To inspect an penal and charitable
institutions of State, county and-citv..
Thirdâ To advise with the managers of
these institutions as to improvements in meth
ods, needs and abuses.
Fourth â To report to the Governor and Leg
islature the result of their Investigations and
recommend desirable changes. It ' Is not the
duty of the board to right wrongs, but to re
port them to Uie power that can right them
Kifthâ To publish Mich data, statistics and i
general information as will inform the pub- !
lie hp to the system of charities, the tnÂ«tltu
tlons ar.d their management; remove suspicions
where unjustly founded and publish â¢ abuses
when necessary. Their powers for reform are
education and publicity.
What have these boards accomplished? â¢
For the pauper: They .have secured better
care and treatment for the thousands who have
become helpless by Â«ge and disease. They have
placed in the way of self support thousands
of others who, from mental weakness were
improvident or unable to set themselves to
work.
For the insane: They have gathered the
insane from almtaouses, Jails and great 'bas-
> I tiles, and placed them in hospitals where
. 1 thousands haw been restored to their right
; ralnds. or in honits where they can receive
i r that care which their unfortunate condition
> ! demands.
For the feeble-minded: They have collected
!;the feeble-minded childrrn into schools, where
;i the little intelligence they have can be. drawn
! out and developed, and have segregated and
'; furnii-heJ care- for the feeble-minded adults
i j who uoulii otherwise be Increasing the mass
: of degmerate population.
'j . . . THE CHILD IX COURT..
: I For the criminal: . They have fostered those
: measures for stopping the' child at the thresh
. hold cf crime by juvenile courts and probation.
[ -They have besn influential in changing the
system of punjyhmsnt for crime, inherited
, ; from the '' dark ageÂ», ."a system which pro
; j)Os>ed to avenge crlrne", an tye for an eye, a
I tooth tor a tooth, which in practice was meted
; out in double measure, to a system which
j .treats a crfma aa a disease and has for Us
J purpose the protection, of. society only. Under
; this system the instruments . of. bodily tor
i ture have disappeared and in their place have
J come books and schools. - They, have estab
i lished training schools for Juveniles, reforma-
I tories on a graded -merit system for first of-
I fender?, a parole system for all classes, and
j the advisory pardoning board. They have also
j secured the indeterminate sentence and the
r habitual criminal act, whereby the criminal
i who h&s passed hope- can, for the safety of
I society, be held until his death, and yet the
door for the regenerated may be always opaned.
. For the public: They have economized the
expenditure of public funds and have increased
results; they,' have kdopted means for pre
venting the increase .of dependents by seeking
out and purifying the source of supply; they
have Improved tho service of county and city
charities, corrected the indiscriminate giving
at relief, and have in a large measure stopped
the pauperization of the able-bodied lazy.
In. general: State Boards of Charities have
collected masses ' of facts from many fields,
classified and reduced them to a science; have
ameliorated the sufferings of thousands of af
flicted- men, women; and children and ele
, vated -their moral plane; have opened the
well spring of .philanthropy, inspired a higher
j Ideal of civic duty. â¢ a stronger sense of moral
j responsibility, ii deeper feeling of the universal
brotherhood of man. . .
JAILS BREEDERS OF CRIME.
I . Rev. J. K. MfLean, D. D., of Oakland
spoke on "The County Jail." Dr. Mc-
Lean referred, to the county jails of
California as breeding places for crime,
saying in part: â¢
.The criminals' should be segregated. The
practice of placing all of the criminals in
touch with â¢ each other Is a bad one. % One
quarter of the criminals receive their educa
tion and acquire criminal instincts .â while,
confined In the Jails. | This Is particularly true
of ths boys. They are thrown in with a lot
of hardened criminals -and -learn to regard
them a3 Ideals, when they listen to stories
of crime. ! As Judge Llndaey hag. said, a ten
days' sentence of a boy -In an ordinary jail
is .tnouKb. to..flx..many a boy's destiny with
the criminal class. .It Is the congrenate sys
tem that ,1s so injurious to- the characters of
the prisoners. 'Most of the < Jails of California
are Hrst- class, schools for education in crime.
Jails are -dens, 'as they now' are kept; and
It Is not to much the fault of the Sheriffs and
Supervisors as It is â¢ the fault of the people
who do not- take enough interist in the welfare
of the community -to investigate and attempt
to curb crime* .... . , â ._ .
The subject of. jails was next dis
.cussed by Charles M. Finch. Osgood
Putnam then read a paper on "Proba
tion for Adult Offenders." In part it
was as follows:
At the last session I addressed you upon the
subject of the probation law for adult offend
ers, and this conference recommended ' the : pas
sage of such a law; In the Interim such a law
has been passed and now awaits enforcement
at your hands. The law is permissive and will
only be:i)ut Into effect where the community
ami the bench take It up. At present the only
court that has put this ' law ; into effect â¢ is : in
Alameda County. Funds must be obtained for
the salary of the probation officer, from chari
table persons or. Institutions, before the law
can be put. into effect elsewhere.
PROVISIONS OF THE LAW.
The provisions of the law are that the court
shall ' appoint a Probation Officer who, upon
the arrest of any personVfor crime, shall gather
careful records of his entire history, ready , to
present to the court. * If the person then pleads
guilty or Is; convicted the court. listens to the
recommendation of the 'Probation Offlcei/if toe
SEARCH MADE

Sergeant Major Henry F. Walls
Is Gone From Presidio and
Is Supposed to Be Drowned

Annual Inspection of Ninth
Cavalry Will Take Place on
Green Turf of Links To-Day
The disappearance of Squadron Ser
geant Major Henry F. "Walls, Ninth
Cavalry, from the Presidio Is causing
much uneasiness among the colored
troops at the post. Where he is or
what has happened to him nobody
connected with the squadron knows.
It is now nearly ten days since he
has been seen by his comrades. Pre
vious to that time he had been seek
ing the flowing bowl pretty freely, and
for the first few days after his dis
appearance it was thought he had
gone downtown to finish his spree. As
time wore on and he failed to show
up, a diligent search of his favorite
haunts was made, , but without suc
cess. Yesterday a rumor reached the
post that a fisherman had stated that
the day before, while he was coming
in from sea, he had seen the body of
a colored soldier floating in the bay
with some sort of yellow braid on
the arm of his coat sleeve, which, from
the* description, corresponded with the
chevron worn on Walls* uniform. The
fisherman stated that' the day was
rough and stormy and the light dull,
and that before he could . put about
the body had disappeared. This may
possibly be a solution of the mystery.
An examination of Walls' accounts
and effects showed everything to be
in order, the only thing missing be-
ing a pistol
Walls was very popular with his
company. He was in the battle of
Santiago de Cuba, where he fought
valiantly and was severely wounded.
CAVALRY TO USE LINKS.
Colonel Sedgwick Pratt, inspector
general of the division of the Pacific,
and Major J. P. Wisser, artillery in
spector, began their annual inspection
of the cavalry and artillery post of
the Presidio yesterday morning. The
day was devoted to inspection of the
records. I
The cherished Kea of Major Bigelow
that his troops should be allowed to
maneuver on the golf links will be
realized to-day, weather permitting. The
order has gone forth from headquarters
that the inspection of the cavalry shall
take place on the ground now occupied
by the golf links. Heretofore the ma
neuvers and drills have taken place on
the lower parade ground and on the
high grounds back of the point, neither
of which was fully adequate for the
whole squadron. The lower grounds
have been turned into a slushy lake by
the recent rains and the point grounds
are too small, hence the edict has gone
forth and the cavalry will prance over j
the soft green sward of the links. The j
cÂ«eÂ» fit to recommend a suspension of the sen
; ttnee. The i*-rson is then allowed to go back
! to his home surroundings under ihe amhorlta
i tive but kindly control of the Probation Ofrt
! c*r. He must reaort to that officer continu
! ously during such period a? the court sees fit.
If he fails from grace and returns to evil hab
' its or associatte the officer on his own motion
â¢ brings ' him into court and he is thbn sen
tenced. If. en the contrary, his conduct Is
i good, after the probationary period he is dis
: charged.
TUe real purpose- of law should be the re
formation of th? criminal and the protection of
society; the result of the present treatment i3
that the man is macie worse instead of better.
Kxpericnce shows that th? prr^ent punishment
! docs not act as a deterrent for MmseK' or
' others; that at his discharge he takes society
j by the throat more viciously than ever. The
; true object la defeated, and at an enormous
' expense to the state.
j ' Dr. Samuel G. Smith of Denver read a
j paper on "The Child as a Social Prob- ;
lem." Dr. Smith has made a wide I
, study of the child problem in regard to .
' crime, and enlightened the conference j
I' with a valuable address. â¢
"Juvenile Crime", was the subject of j
a paper by Herbert W. Lewis, superin- I
tendent of the Boys' and Girls' Aid So
ciety.
"Some Points Regarding California's
Aid to Dependent Children" was the I
last subject discussed before the con- I
ference. The paper was presented by j
W. S. Melick, secretary of the State j
Board of Examiners. ,

Chronic Kidney
III Â£Â» /\ n cy Â£j^
A WELL informed physician com-
presses a lot of information into this
short sentence that should be given wide
publicity â viz.: "All diseases of the kid-
neys are primarily inflammations â they
get serious as they become fixed or
chronic."
The Kidney trouble that is recent â of
a few days' or a few weeks' duration â is
seldom serious. "But if it lingers several
months it is becoming fixed (chronic),
and nothing but a cure for Bright's Dis-
ease will correct it.
Few know that. All ought to. Well in-
formed druggists do, and many of them
have given us direct certificates right in
point. For instance. Druggist N.
Schwartz of McAllister and Buchanan-
stated only last week: "Fulton's Com-
pound is the only thing on my shelves
that I can conscientiously recommend for
Bright's Disease. You have the or.ly
thing known that cures chronic Kidney
disease."
We have more letters every week than
we can publish, but here is a late one
that illustrates Schwartz's statement. It
is from E. E. Young, who writes from
112 Dearborn st., Chicago, under date
Feb. 19, 1904: v
- "The writer has triea your remedy for
Bright's Disease, purchasing it from the |
Colbert Drug Co. of State and Monroe i
sts. Ho knows from experience that it is I
the, most meritorious and effective rem- j
edy he has ever tried for Kidney trou-
ble."
This letter almost seems as if it was
written for this article, but it came in
due course, the same as dozens that are
received weekly. We do not invite testi-
monials except in purely chronic cases
known to be ; incurable by .all other
known means.
If you have any Kidney trouble what-
ever why not start right at first with the
only thing known that will cure it in all
its stages? .
Ask for Fulton's Renal Compound for
Bright's i Disease. At all first-class drug-
gists' in this city and at one leading
druggist's in interior cities. Jno. J. Ful-
