.*_ REDDING MASS MEETING
SALT LJVKE CITY, May 29.-Mrs. Min
nie Maddern Fiske, who was barred from
a professional appearance ,in Salt "Lake
City through her. inability to . secure a
local theater, hired a public hall to-night
and delivered "an address on what .she
termed "The Theatrical Trust' and Its
Effect on Salt Lake." Mrs. Fiske and her
company oJ players' arrived here to-day.
; In opening her address to the largeaudi
ence Mrs. Fiske said:
I am happy to say that the theatrical trust.
which excludes my company from your play
| houfes. is not sufficiently powerful to prevent
. us from stopping in your city on our way to
1 the Pacific CoÂ«st. Nor can It rob me of this
privilege of addressing you.
I Mrs. Fiske said she was sure the local
managers would be glad to. open the doors
of their theaters to her company. if they
dared, but they dared not, to do so, she
said. In the EaSt and on the -Pacific
Coast, she said, there were theaters. open
to. independent actors, but the, theatrical
syndicate had endeavored to block the
way to California, by holding the avenues
of approach, so that. lr would be Impos
sible- for ; an independent. actor . t<3 fill -a
tour-from Chicago to. San Francisco. . T"tie
, trust, she aaid, made it impo:-ible for-an
independent actor to play in Kansas City,
Omana, Denver, or SaltjLake. \u0084 . j
, ."You can readily understand," said Mrs.
Fiske, "that the expense entailed by the
journey of . a Jarge, dramatic company di
rect from Chicago to San Francisco would
be more than any degree of success in
San Francisco would make profitable."
Among other cities which she. said were
"trust ridden,',' Mrs. Fiske named Cincin
nati, Toledo, Washington, Detroit,.Cleve
land. : Toronto, Montreal, New Orleans,
Buffalo, .St. Paul and Sacramento. . ,-\u25a0
In conclusion, the speaker declared that
the patrons of the theater have the right
to demand that their theaters shall be
open to every werthy actor whose per
formance, they may desire to see. The
patrons of the theaters had' it in their
power, she said, to liberate their theaters
from an unfair and unjust domination.
Mrs. Fiske' s appearance was under the
auspices of the Press Club. A small ad
mission fee was charged and the proceeds
were donated to the orphanages of the
City. ; .:V -V- : ."- ' . \u25a0

tack on the special franchise tax law of

franchises of. the public utilities, such
as street "cars, electric light, gas 'and

The law was sharply, assailed by Root

as unconstitutional on "the grouh'd tliat
it. impairs the obligation of contracts
under which the * corporations acquired

CHICAGO, May 29.â Renewed aggresive
ness onthe.part of the employers in the
teamsters' strike ls'expected' on Wednes-'
day.- Takingr advantage of the legal holl-;
day which will come to-morrow plans
will be formed .-for .extensively. Increasing"
the volume. of deliveries to be made from
the lumber districts." The down- town
business houses where strikes exist have
at about 400 unemployed 'drivers.
These they" cannot use. on account of the
inability; of the police department to
.supply- protection for them, and on Wed
nesday these men will , be sent . to the
firms in the lumber districts i which are
in need' of drivers and a strong and de
termined effort will be made .to . Increase
the volume, of business done in that
section. The lumber dealers had 200 teams
in operation to-day. ." . . ,
Practically all of ' the teamsters em
ployed by the hardwood dealers in the
lumber district are now out and the soft
lumber: dealers are tied up. comparatively
speaking, with the exception of one firm,
which continues to do business with union
teamsters. Notwithstanding .the .shortage
in lumber, the -building contractors ex
press themselves as highly confident that
-there will be no strike among, their men
and no tie-up in the building industry. .
The Hay Grand Jury commenced to-day
an investigation into the strike, directing
its inquiry particularly to that feature
which is said to- involve the' payment-of
money for ah attempt I "to bring about a
settlement of the difficulty by a number
of the labor leaders. It was algo-pro
posed to inquire into' the existence of an
alleged blacklist against the striking ex
press wagon drivers. "The general agents
of the express companies were subpenaed,
but all of them informed the Jurors that
they had no , knowledge whatever of the
existence .of > a blacklist,- nor : - did ,they
knbw--"of any measures or methods that
had been adopted with the view -of pre
venting the employment of the striking
dflverÃ in other cities. , ' . '\u25a0 '.'*.,

, Therefore as much as we should
like to quote here the various
prices at which these pianos are to go
'(and. which we feel " almost confident
: would . sell the entire 71 in a single
day) we are obliged to withhold the
figures from publication at this . time
for the .reasons above stated. - But we
hope and believe it will prove sufficient.
when: the Wiley B. Allen Co. (who has
never yet Indulged In any extravagant
language or wildcat advertising to
sell a piano) addresses this statement
to his : friends and people of his own
home city, it .will be accepted fully for
all that It implies. And we here wish
to affirm that we not only believe? but
We know," that this is the grandest op-
portunity people of this city have ever
had to buy a piano and take. choice ot
71 splendid- uprights; from more than a
dozen different high grade makes, for
less money than they would ordinarily
have to pay for the mere pretense of- a.
piano. v .-. , . r
.We haye \u25a0 never before-ln all* our busi-
ness experience been in a position to
offer .piano bargains that could any-
where approach this." and which is only
made possible by the liberal â¢â¢ adjust-
ment, and \u25a0 large v lump sum in ' cash al-
lowed, us by the insurance companies
every dollar of which will be applied
pro.rata. and .deducted from the first
cost of .the various instruments offered
in this sale, and at which prices, they
can, be had to-morrow ,f rom . our re-
tail \u25a0?. wareroomsâ 931 Market- streetâ
on terni3 of, |25"down. and:ten. a month
;if = you are in the least Interested, re-
member there is nothingito be-gained
by .waiting,' and much may: be lostâ for
there's but â¢ seventy-one of these piano*,
while there are three hundred and fifty
thousand people in this city,- and should
one-half of, them- get their eye on-this
announcement (and it's in all the San
Francisco â¢ papers -. to-day) ;you- would
stand less than onÂ«-haif a chance in a
thousand to get one of these bargains^
even to-morrow â 71 pianos for 350.000
people .is; a very -'small per cent â just
one In five thousandâ and as these bar-
gatns i can never, be duplicated, if- you
a re ; the ; head ' of \u25a0th c house." and have no
piano in it.' it's your "move." Come to utÂ»
early, to-morrow, : at - 931 Market street,

mm; THE WILEY B. ALLEN CO..
931 -Market Street. .
Now \u25a0what we propose -to do Is just
this: â Throw our doors open at 931 Mar-
ket street to-morrow morning prompt-
ly, at nine o'clock, "and offer these sev-
enty-one pianos to the three hundred
and fifty thousand residents of San
Francisco, at exactly their factory cost
to -us-^-less 'the' amount the insurance
companies have allowed us on- each of
the various pianosâ which is a consid-
erable sumâ and so reduces , the actual
cost : to us ,'as | hey ' stand now; and at
which to a cent we propose to sell them,
that; it* seems almost recklessness, in
fact] if, we were 'obliged to publish the
prices; at which they, are to go, it .would
not [only, be" "reckless" but ruinous, for
they are all with one or two exceptions
from our regular fine line of high grade
pianos, brand new, and for all practical
purposes just as fine as "when 'they left
)the factory, and to publish a price far
,below their factory cost, and less than
half ;ltheir actual value, -would prove
disastrous to our outside agencies, and
so handicap us here at home in getting
a fair retail price for these makes in
the future. ; that It would be .better to
throw the entire 71 In the ocean to be-
gin with. ,
Not a single piano of the 71 we pro-
pose to offer In this sale â for practical-
ly, "nothing," as compared to their real
worth and actual value â has had its
keys, action, or any portion of its inte-
rior or working parts touched by either
â¢flre or water; and we guarantee each of
the .71 pianos offered here, to be in
every way a perfect piano of its class,
outside of what may appear' upon the
surface in the way of slight bumps and
varnish friction. â But as our repair
rooms, and workshop on the top floor
with all its tools and appliances were
totally destroyed, we are not in a posi-
tion to. and shall make no effort to re-
pair or cover up even., the slightest
scratch or mar, on any of these pianos,
butywlll dispose, of them Just as they
stand-^-and at a fearful sacrifice â in
accordance with the prompt and liberal
adjustment of the insurance underwrit-
ers, who treated us handsomely, and Im-
mediately settled our claims in fulL
"While our repair shops on tho top
floor of ;thi3 wholesale storage ware-
house- â including: 23 upright pianos;
two grands; and seven piano players â
were totally destroyed by flre on the
18th. there were 71 splendid new : , up-
right pianos on the lower floor of the
wholesale warehouse, which were nei-
ther touched by flre or water, but which
through the efforts of the flre and in-
surance patrol in hurriedly massing
them together In groups, in order to
cover them with tarpaulins and water-
proof covers, many of the pianosâ in fact
most all of them â got more or le3s
bumped into/ scratched, and varnish
damaged, through the hurried effort to
protect them from their greater foesâ
flre and water.
; This Is the ratio of the 350.000 people
In this city to the 71 pianos saved from
the recent flre that destroyed our entire
workshops, and a portion of our whole-
sale storage warerooms. just across the
alley, and back of our main retail store
â 931. Market .streetâ and in our great
fire sale to-morrow, what we propose
to do to' these 71 pianos that escaped 13
a caution; and if you're Interested read
on for we'll come to that In a minute.

MIKADO'S "MEN BEHIND THEGUNS" FIRING A B-INCH RAPID'PIRER OX I'HE FLAGSHIP OF ADMIKAL TOGO.
Baltic Meet already has been accepted,
for ll Is no longer a factor tn the war.
There was amazement \u25a0among naval
officers to-day when Admiral Togo's
report of his sweeping victory was
transmitted through the State Depart
ment. â¢ This was intensified this even
ing when the Navy Department re
ceived its own advices, telling of addi
tional Russian disasters. â¢ - . \u25a0:
The majority of American naval of
ficers are Russian sympathizers. They
were confident In the 'belief that,' even
if Admiral Rojestvensky were not vic
torious, he would inflict such serious
damage upon the Japanese as to leave
the result of the battle in doubt. They
expected that enough of his vessels
would reach Vladivostok to constitute
a prolonged menace to the. Japanese.
Eve n those officers who are most pro
nounced in their sympathy for Japan
looked for no such decisive .victory, as
tbst which Togo has won. They ex
pected him to win, but ex the loss of
many, of his ships. ..;
Friends of both Ruse fa and Japan at
tribute, the amazing result of .the great-,
est naval battle, the world has ever
known to the strategy of Togo, flrst'of
ail and. after that, to the accuracy of
his gunfire and to the superior morale
in the Japanese navy. Togo is pro
claimed as one of the greatest naval
strategists in history, if not. the very
greatest. He fought the battle accord
ing; to bis own plans' and be did not
move until conditions were such that
all of his carefully -laid plans could be
carried out to the letter. His strategy
was more than a match for the supe
rior force Against him and J the j over
whciTninK defeat of the flower of .. the
Russian navy is attributed much more
to the genius of the mighty Togo than
to the ships under bis command. \u25a0
American strategists do not doubt that
Togo has taught them some, new;: lessons
in 'naval warfare, but they say details
of the engagement must be received;be
fore, they can profit' by". His experience.
Champions, of the battleship and advo
cates of torpedo boats; are both claiming
that their arguments have been greatly
strengthened by the. battle, but neither
side, has any conclusive details. on which
to base "its claims. "' â¢' ' :
Ttoe "exponents of torpedo boats insist
that it is evident from the very nature
of . the result % that ; most > of.' the -'-Russian
lotoses were : Inflicted .in the torp'sdo* boat
attack' under cover of ; darkness' on *6at
urday night. The supporters of the bat
tles-hip as the most powerful 'and .im
portant factor Jn naval warfare "contend,
An the other hand,' that it is ;, much more
plausible ! that the Japanese' battleships
fctood off and hammered ': the " / Russians
with their heat'y guns, and that,the.re
eult was' due entirely "to" the* 'superior
csarkemanship of the Japanese, \ Instead
This latter report is credited at the
Navy Department not only on "account
of its trustworthy source, but be
cause it fits in with Admiral Togo's
report, which showed that bit*' ships
had .scattered in pursuit of the Rus
sians. It is regarded as-quite probable
that news of the " destruction or cap
ture of some of -the fugitives- may have
reached the shore, through unofficial,
but, none the less, reliable sources be
fpre.it could 'be communicated by Ad
miral Togo. " '\u25a0
la view of the vastly superior accu
racy of the Japanese gunfire, which,
,was attested to by the results of To
co's attacks on. Saturday and Sunday,
it is considered probable . that all of
the Russian ships l were so badly crip
pled that their comparatively, unJnJur-.
Ed pursuers will be able to overhaul
them before they reach Vladivostok.
For such of the ships, as reach , the
haven for which they are being driven
there can be no hope of escape, i The
naval experts agree that,, even, if _ali
the" "Russian ships which bTad escaped
destruction or capture up ,to the time,
the last report was sent to the Navy
Department should reach .Vladivostok,
they' w6uld not'.cio^stltutjs* a *Â° reÂ»r cÂ»

have been put out of commission, either
by sinking or capture, since Toko re
ported, and It Is supposed that one of

annihilation soon will he complete, and
Vice Admiral Rojestvenaky, Its brave
commander, haÂ« (one down to death
with hi* flasahlp, the battleship Knlas
SourareO. This U the '. belief In the
IVavr Department to-day, baaed on con
fidential reports which are regarded as
authentic.
Admiral Rojestvenskys message to
the Czar, sent when he entered East
ern waters, was:
â¢"If I am victorious, I shall inform
you. If I am vanquished, Togo will in
lorm you."
American naval officers who have
followed his course believed he would
make good his boast, and they ac?
cept as certain that as between death
and surrender he chose the former.
The source of the Information regard
ing the Russian flagship and the death
of the fleet commander is not divulged,
butÂ«the manner in which it was made
public indicates that It is fully
credited.
Another report received at the Navy
Department from *a source which,
while not official, is regarded as per
fectly reliable, states that Admiral
Togo's victory Is much more sweeping !
than was indicated by his official re
port, and that more than two-thirds of
the 3 Russian ships have been sunk or i
captured, while, the others are being
pursued with every indication that
most of them will be sent to the"bot
tom or added to the already long list
of prizes. . ,
Almost every officer of each service,
when approached for his opinion, de
clared that no expert could give an'in
telligent explanation until' the details
of the battle were known. There was
one-point, however, on which they all
agreed. It \u25a0was that the outcome of
the battle was, due to the preparedness
of the Japanese and to their superior
training. It U a carious fact that, at
the beginning: of the war, the \u25a0ympa
tbirs of the .'army and' naval officers
were with . Japan;, but there, has been
a. remarkable chance In their "views.
1 Privately most of them- explained
themselves *as being pro-Russian in
their leanings, and the deepest, sym
pathy and admiration ! was ' manifested
for Rojestveneky. While no officer
would consent to the use of his name,
a dozen or more declared that they
were deeply sympathetic with Rojest^
vensky. .who. was undoubtedly, a man
of courage and ability, and there is ex
treme regret that he met with such
overwhelming 'defeat. In fact, they
favor the white man as against the
yellow man, as one of them put it to
day, and while they have great respect
and admiration for the Japanese, they
would have been better pleased if the
Russians had- been the victors. Some
officers v of i high rank consented ito be
interviewed, but it must be said that
they did not indicate in which direc
tion their sympathies were extended.
Admiral Dewey, Lieutenant General
Chaffee and other leading army, and
naval officers manifested keen interest
in' the battle arid discussed what they
considered the. first real battle between
modern ironclads with perfect freedom
among themselves, but" they were
rather, reluctant to give their Views for
publication. President Roosevelt re
cently issued an order forbidding these
officers to discuss any phase" of the war
for' publication, but this did not ' pre
clude an informal talk among them
selves.
of the torpedoes. In all of the previous
engagements the Japanese relied upon
the accuracy of their fire, and stood oft
far enough to put 'them out of danger
from the Inferior marksmanship of ' the
Russians. These tactics,- the battleship
adherents beneve, have again been fol
lowed by Togo and with greater skill
than before. They think the Russians
became panic-stricken under the accu
racy of the fire which was poured in on
them; and that this contributed materi
ally .to the Japanese victory. They also
point to the destruction or capture of ten
of the thirteen Russian torpedo boats as
proof that the mosquito craft did not
play any important part in the ' battle.
Conditions which would have favored a,
Japanese night attack by. torpedo boats
would' also have favored the Russians,
and It 1s impossible to believe, they say,
that the little Russian boats: would- not
have .inflicted " s6me damage, at least,
while their own big ships were being
blown up by Japanese torpedoes.
Secretary Morton is convinced that the
prestige of the battleships has not suf
fered; In that belief he voices the opin
ion of the President ; and some of the
ablest strategists in the navy.
Unless the full report* cause a de
cided change In the present under
standing; 'of the manner In which the
battle was fbuBrht, there> will , .bÂ« no
change tn the policy of building* up an
American navy composed chiefly of bat
tleships and powerful armored; cruis
ers.*

WASHINGTON. } May 29.-Admiral
Dewey to-night expressed . the belief that
Admiral Togo has struck a powerful blow
for peace, which he declared to be Rus
sia's best alternative.
"It is the beginning of the end," he
said, "and I can see no other outcome
than that Russia will sue for peace. The
advices so far seem to show that the
J&pancse. achieved their victory by hurl
ing- torpedo boats against the Russians.
It Is not to be supposed, however, that
the Russian battleships would surrender
to the torpedo boats alone. Admiral
Togo's training and the . preparedness
throughout his fleet, I am convinced, are
responsible for his stupendous victory. If
some of the Russian ships escaped, we
still have' the record, for the victories at
Manila and Santiago were complete in
that all of the ships of the enemy were
either destroyed or taken."

ion that- the greatest damage was done^^

It Is said, that Togo was prepared to sac
rifice*, practically- the whole of his mos
quito fleet.' if .he could thereby destroy
Rojestvejasky's '. battleships "and "armored
cruisers. . .1- . - .
The same editorial recalls the fact that
the '"battles of Manila Bay and ' Santiago
did not cost the Americans a single ship.
and. indeed hardly a single life, and "it
would, therefore, not be surprising to find
that Togo had sained .a relatively blood
less victory."
In varying strains of eulogy all ."the
papers, pay tribute to Admiral Togo's
extraordinary success. They, say that the
son has set on Russia's naval glory, and
comment on possibilities of. peace. The
general opinion Is that it would be crim
inal for the Emperor of Russia' to con
tinue the war, but serious doubts are
expressed as to .whether even Saturday's
disaster will ; convince the .war party' in
St. Petersburg of the hopelessness of k
further:* struggle. The belief seems to
prevail ' that it ' will rather harden the
hearts of the war advocates to persevere
to the bitter end. '- .
Details of tin; great sea fight are anx
iously awaited, for beyond the press dis
patches and the . Japanese official ac
counts ' nothing : is' yet , available.

"Other official reports received, besides Togo's, show that 2

and 1 sunk; 5 unarmored cruisers sunk ; 1 transport captured and
2 sunk; 1 destroyer captured and 3 sunk.

Togo's combined .fleet. S _
The naval engagement and pursuit are still in progress" . so
that it will take some time before the final results" can be known.
Tokio's Account of the Combat
Beyond the results little is known here of Togo's stunning
victory. Rojestvensky reached Quelpart Island, off Korea, early on
Saturday and headed direct for the Tsir Islands. The exact
number of vessels in his fleet is not clear, but he had his main
fighting vessels, with a number of light cruisers and transports.
The disposition of the Japanese fleet appears to have been
an ideal one. Admiral Togo had waitedvfor weeks in the vicipity
of the Tsu Islands, refusing to be lured away and to forfeit his
advantage. The inner line was held by Admiral Togo with ; the
battleships and Vice Admiral Kamimura with the cruisers.
Rear Admiral Kataoka, with The light squadron, first at
tacked Rojestvensky. The order and circumstances of the attack
arc not clear. According to one report, Kamimura went outside
the straits and foiled Rojestvensky, preventing his retreat.
When Rojestvensky encountered Admiral Togo there ap
pears to have been a running fight to the northeastward on Satur
day afternoon. There were a series of desperate and successful
torpedo attacks on Saturday night and a resumption of the battle
on Sunday, Togo pressing the Russian fleet* toward the southeast
ern coast of Korea.
Mastery of the Sea Decided. \u25a0:\u25a0
Pending the conclusion of the Japanese pursuit and the iden
tification of the three vessels which Russian prisoners report were
sunk and the determination of the condition of the damaged ships,
which escaped to the northward, it is impossible to tell the re
maining strength of the Russians, but the most liberal allowance
leaves the Japanese overwhelmingly masters of the sea.
1 Only fragmentary tidings of the victory have been in circula
tion in Tokio since Saturday night. The people were confident, but
official confirmation of their belief and hope thrilled the people as
nothing has since hostilities were begun. The long voyage of Ad
miral Rojestvensky; the equality â on paper-â of the strength of
the fleets ; the irritation caused by reported violations of neutral
ity ; the apparent certainty that a formidable section of the Rus
sian fleet would reach Vladivostok;. the vital bearing of the con
test on the war, and, possibly, the future of the empire, created an
intense strain, which Admiral Togo's victory ends instantly.

BERKELEY.'' May 29.â A dreadful
plant disease has arisen to trouble the
fruit p-owerfi' of California . and the
Â«Â«rvlces,of Professor R. E. Smith, as
fe distant professor in' plant pathology,
have been enlisted -to cure the ill.
\u25a0 s*rofessor Smith announced . to-day
; that the Government at Washington
would co-operate with the Agricultur
al College here m an attempt to wipe
out the femon brovra rot, a disease
0 Is threatening' the destruction
, pf ttie, entire lemon growing industry
. "of California.- '
â¢.\u25a0 The brown rot in lemons constitutes
a "jiew problem for plant pathologists.
.. . Us character differing radically from
*my fungus or parasitic growths
'kpown.,to those who make tha expert
-study of such diseases a specialty. Its
effects thus far have been to partly
paralyze the lemon growing . business,
nearly 60 per cent of the crop last year
having been spoiled by the brown rot.
The disease spreads a brown moid on ;
the surface of the fruit, which event- .
ually shrivels the 16mon, making it un
fit for use.
Three years ago the first sign of the !
*brown rot appeared' in the lemon orch
ards of Southern California. It spread
and attacked nearly every orchard in I
the State. It is a pest not known in
other countries.
<. A Government expert is to come to
California during the next few weeks
to work on the problem. \u25a0 Professor ;
"Smith said to-day that the authorities
are considering a number of names for
this mission. The man chosen will
work with the Agricultural College
-stan*.
Professor Smith and his assistants
have four plant diseases to which they
are devotinp: especial attention, these
being the walnut blight, which is re- *
celving study at the bands of A. M.
West, Government expert, "at ; Whittier,
"' in Southern California; pear, blight,
lemon brown rot and sweet /potato
blight. . #
The college will have < much better
facilities for work of Jttols sort when
.the new pathological laboratory is es
tablished In Southern California, the
legislature haying appropriated $30,
000 for this purpose. A site will be se
lected in July and the building erected
at once. There is also $20,000 available
for pathological and .vitlcultural re
search work, Independently of the lab
oratory project, and this, money is to
be expended by the college as soon as
Is available In experlmehls~that are
now being pjanned In connection, with
tiie four plant diseases referred to.
Throe of Professor Smith's assist
ants are now at work near Vacaville
studying the pear blight. They will be
joined in August by M. B. Waite. a
Government expert from Washington,
who started this work oh . the pear
blight last year v and will come out this
*umm*T to pass upon the work done
since he left.. -\u25a0â¢-â¢\u25a0â¢//*--.

'^T^HAT war should result from the present crisis between "Norway.
I and Sweden seems almost incredible. Such a tragedy for such
â¢* a cause would be little less than a crime against humanity, and
we can but hope that'eouncils of moderation will prevail in gt>od
"time to prevent what* would be practically civil war.
The existing- <teadlock is, howeyer, distinctly dangerous. The
King has definitely refused to sanction the bill providing a sepa
rate consular service Tor the two countries. '.The' Norwegian Min
isters have thereupon tendered their resignations, which; the King
has declined to accept. The Ministers upon the other hand ihave
refused to sign the protocol of the proceedings and the royal {veto
has, therefore, no constitutional existence. The Norwegian press,
doubtless echoing the voice of the country, declares, the King's de
cision to show that Norway has no longer a sovereign willing to
.follow the national advice, and the Norwegian Cabinet has warned
the King in very plain language that his veto of the bill is tanta
mount to a dissolution of the union.
That of course; is very dangerous language. If the Norwegians
persist in their present attitude and if Sweden be willing to ac
quiesce, a basis of independence might conceivably: be arranged: 'It
: seems, however, more probable that Sweden will object to disso
lution for the same reasons that were urged in America before the
.civil war against a precisely similar movement. It is a very awk
ward impasse, and if grave difficulties are to be avoided it will only
be by the exercise of tact and statesmanship of which -fortunately
the King seems to possess a fairly full measure.

THE VALLEY OF, DEATHâ S..O. F.,
San Jose, Cal. The Valley." of Death on
the island of Java is a most remarkable
natural example of an atmosphere loaded

with -large stones. The surface is covered
less instantly and. die in a few, minutes.
No craters or fissures are visible on the
floor of this valley, and. it is thought
that the openings are near the base of

T -x rHI'LE the Â£ull measure of the action and of its -consequences
. \A/. may. not now be taken, enough is known of the fight in the
\ * Straits of- Korea to warrant the conclusion that Togo has
ixushed the Russian fleet, destroyed its preponderance over his own,
reduced it below equality with his, and has- held the mastery of
jthe sea for Japan. To have done this* is -the winning of a-very,sig
nificant victory. It was conceded by naval experts, claimed by Rus
sia and not denied by Japan, that the Russian fleet outclassed the
Japanese by 50 per cent. Under such circumstances the Japanese
admiral has accomplished that which from â¢ a naval standpoint
seemed to-be the -impossible.
. eOf course it* has been done by superiority of tactics and strat
egy, and the entirely superior drill and discipline and skill of the
Japanese behind the'guns. It is the greatest surprise in war known
since the Italian campaign of Bonaparte, that in the game of war
by land and sea, played according to the rules of the game, the
Russian generals and admirals have been distinctly outclassed tby
the Japanese, and that the Russian rank and file,, have ..been out
fought; by the Japanese rank and file in every encounter. Russia
entered upon aggressive war, Japan was put upon the defensive and
her movement rapidly became offensive. Neither in offense nor de
fense -has Russia justified her supposed military power and effective
ness. She has hung like a. shadow over continental Europe and her
imaginary power has justified the dreams of her statesmen of uni
versal empire.
No one can foresee what this last action may produce. Nor
mally it should cause a truce, a pourparler, a protocol and a peace
treaty* In the interest of humanity, and of international peace, it
' is to be hoped that these steps will follow. The grand army of
Russia, the drilled" and disciplined force that has been seen at the
annual reviews and parades, is destroyed. The population is being
sapped to send to the front raw, levies, who have to be whipped into
the troop trains and who take every opportunity to make a disor
derly demonstration 01 their unwillingness to fight. It is significant
that among the orders of the War Office it is enjoined upon officers
to keep these* ignorant peasants in order by teaching them to read
and write! That is a flashlight revealing the condition of the popu
lation ixom which the autocracy must draw the material to fight in
its defense.
At sea Russia has no naval history. Her naval commanders
no doubt are in possession of the school knowledge and seamanship
necessary to the management of a fleet, but Russia has little sea
"coast and .but little sea-going spirit. It is interesting that she owes
her present lack of skill and experience on the water to the awe
with which she has inspired all Europe. No nation has cared to try
conclusions with her, and her fleets have rotted at the docks or
have been used on spectacular occasions to. impress the world. She
is getting her naval experience now in the hard school taught by
I Japan.
In due time the Grand Dukes will announce the continuance
of -the war to the bitter end, the Czar will consult the skeleton
of St. Serafine and the beneficiaries of the autocracy will try to
make the world see the struggle as a conflict in the interest of Chris
tianity and the white race against paganism and the yellow. But all
that is a purely medieval view in which the Western world feels no
interest. It' is an index to the Russian policy of embroiling other
nations if possible. France has loaned billions of francs to the Rus
sian Government and to Russian enterprises. Having grub-staked
the autocracy it is to the interest of France that Russia should win.
The Franco-Russian alliance was to admonish the Kaiser,', but' that
monarch has ambitions of his own. He is not averse to entering
upon other campaigns of continental expansion. Russia on one
side and France on the other offer inviting fields for that policy
that has been dear to the Hohenzollerns ever since the family
started as Landgraves in the Black Forest.
The weakening of Russia means the weakening of France.
When o the Kaiser went a- roving on his yacht and took the op
portunity to call on the Sultan of Morocco and assure him that lie
. need not pay any attention to France and at the same time let the
Sultan of Turkey know that his rest need not be disturbed by any
thing done or threatened by France and her ally, he was revealing
his dreams. The defeat of Russia by Japan now will mournfully
impress popular sentiment in France, but' prudent statesmanship
looks forward to the immediate result of more crushing defeats in
the future, which may make both France and Russia the prey of
Germany." \u25a0 , '- ! *.-. - v v r ; V;
So many little considerations are involved in the prolonga
tion of the war that it may be hoped that the action in the Straits
of Korea will lead to a truce. If Russia ask a truce, it is the end.
'There will not be another action. If she do not, her internal trou
bles are sure to multiply. The misfortune to Rojestvensky . will
extend a clamor against the Government from Baku to Helsingfors.
Every illiterate mujik, every starving mendicant, every student that
has-been lashed with Cossack whips, every Finn deprived of his
liberty and language, and every Pole who remembers how order
.came to reign in Warsaw, from opposite motives will raise combined
voice and fist against the autocracy. With Japan at the circum
ference and domestic discontent at the center the grand ducal boast
of war to the bitter end will be vain words only.
JAPAN HOLDS THE EASTERN SEA.
One of the most unreasonable com
plaints ever-registered with the chief
steward came from 7 a . Chicago woman,
who had engaged the} stewardess to
dress her hair,.each night for dinner.
One afternoon^ a 1-' terrific; storm arose
and that night ; only.' fifty out, of some
four hundred and fifty -passengers ap
peared at the dinner" table. -After din

that the stewardess had failed. to keep
her hairdressing appointments and she
had been subjected-, to the* annoyance
of having to arrange her own coiffure
under \ most trying circumstances. And

was eating luncheon on deck, and an
Invalid who occupied' the next deck

TV HUMOROUS incident . with a church
L\ for a background ; has, by fall'the
*A rules of comedy/ twice as "^"^
humor as thefsame Incident in: any other
environment. One of u-e most dignified
edifices in a large city was the scene
last Sunday of ; an occurrence so highly
ludicrous that the -'"members' of-the'con
gregation who r witnessed it still laugh
over its absurdity.
The service.. was \u25a0 not -, quite half over
when a * well-dressed '. man ' sauntered
vfiM&k ;*â¢::<:\u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0 the aisle and seated
himself -in the front
pe w. As he threw
the ... p tan overcoat
that he .was carry
ing over the back of
the pew he ; revealed
to - the startled : be
holders that under
it he had concealed
two; ; toy . balloons,
one t red ' and ' the
other ;\u25a0 blue. * Care
fully ! \ twisting \^ the
strings t with which
they 'were attached
around.- his' finger,
he ;Vlet \ \ them soar
into -the air. In
stantly they swept
up above the heads
of \u25a0 the "congrega
tion. The . hymn that
had been in progress
faltered and . broke
and an audible
snicker followed.
The minister, en
tirely unconscious
of the cause of the
commotion, looked
Sown in i wonder- at
the people, Â§ never
thinking to seek for
the cause of the
merriment in the
air above him. His
puzzled frown only
added to the hilar
ity..
The ushers were in
despair. The man
who : was directing
the movements of
the floating balloons
might be a harm
less lunatic; again
he might be any-
Lhing but - a harm
less one; he might
be intoxicated; in
fact, after j a con
ference of all the
ushers it was de
cided that he cer
tainly was intoxi
cated. But how was
tie to be led out of
the ' church without
a scene?
One of the ushers
is a diplomat. / He
took it upon himself,
to approach the man
with the balloons.
The man was gazing
up at his toys with
apparent infantile
delight, when the
usher bent over him.
"You could man
age those balloons
very much better
from a place in the
back of the church,"
said he. "I am sure
that they would go
higher."
"That so?", asked
the stranger with
Interest... He picked
up his" coat and fol
lowed.the usher down the. aisle. Seating
himself in- the back pew, he continued
to toy with his' playthings until slumber
overcame him. Rolling up his overcoat for
a pillow, he placed it under his head and
In a moment' was in the land of dreams.
The balloons still soared above him. If
he let go of the strings they -would go
to the top of the church and there would
be endless difficulty in bringing them
down. The usher determined to prevent
such a catastrophe. He awakened * the
sleeper.
"I think that the air is very bad in
here," he whispered to him. "You could
sleep so much better outside."
"That so?" asked the man pleasantly.
"Balloons go. higher?"
"Yes, your balloons would go much
hfgTTer." '-' '\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0
With a gleeful smile radiating from his
face -he -followed his mentor. As he came
to the doorway, of- the church he let the
balloons go' with a sudden \ whoop. They
had passed the. spires in a moment. Their
owner waved them a farewell.
Then he turned to the usher. \u25a0
"Little boy," he said, "buy you some.
Lots of -fun. Next Sunday.". â¢ \
And -he sauntered down the boulevard,
leaving the "little boy" to wonder if he
will return next 7 Sunday and to dread
his ; appearance. " - Â»

Mrs. Nellie McGreevy's behavior left
open to him 'as^a conscientious peace

took. He had just stepped out of the
county 'prison I ;" and was v sauntering
along Broadway' when . Mrs. McGreevy,
whom he had incarcerated ere . promo

. Liouis and . Florence Delflno are . separ
ated by - interlocutory decree of divorce,
but. since the court half severed their
marital relationship they have dwelt in
propinquity near the intersection of Sixth
and Jessie streets, and every Sunday they
have gone together to Fruitvale and spent
a few hours with their two children. It
was while returning, from one of these
excursions that Louis appropriated and
disappeared with Florence's purse while
she was telephoning from the ferry sta
tion, and when the police found him he
was . in . bed at - his home with the purse
under. his pillow. "
; ','lt's a , funny ; thing," said Louis to
Judge Mogan, "that a woman seldom ap
preciates a joke.'.* '
When it \u25a0\u25a0 was j explained that only fifty
five cents was \ missing from the purse
when it was discovered in. the defendant's
possession, and as Florence appeared j re
luctant to prosecute, his Honor dismissed
the petty larceny Complaint to which she
had subscribed.

Twenty-two-year-old James O'Brien will
probably be sentenced-to eighteen months'
imprisonment when he reappears before
Judge Mogan- this morning., One day last
week it was testified in the Juvenile Court
that he ruined the character of two young
girls with deliberate intent to have them
earn . money \u25a0 for. him by working in a
; dance Kail. Last Saturday , night .he
snatched a purse from the hand of a
Pacific-street \u25a0 siren. , Later that same
night, when arrested by Patrolman Mills,
he blackened "one of his captor's eyes by
unexpectedly punching it. Still later that
night he grossly insulted some respectable
women who, while -.slumming,, were in
specting the City Prison. The two girls
whom ' he . ruined ' will be brought from
the I Magdalen Asylum to-day to testify
against him. - ,
"Don't , know de fairies at all," he" said

their mother, unless Dr., Hemphill chooses
to waive his rights : In their favor. " :
Mrs. Elizabeth P. Daniell, daughter of
the late Mrs. Lizzie J. Hemphill, wife of
Dr. John Hemphill. pastor of Calvary
Presbyterian. Church,, has won a signal
victory In her opposition to Dr. Hemp
hill's petition for, probate of a : copy of
the alleged last will of the deceased;
With very .little ceremony Judge Coff ey
refused to admit the copy to probate yes
terday and appointed Dr.- Hemphill ad
ministrator of decedent's estate.' , His bond
as administrator was rflxed at 52500.
When the matter of the petition was
called Attorney.: Louis Hoefler of the firm
of Bishop & Hoefler presented authorities
In support of his opposition to the admis
sion of the copy of the will. The author
ities were ' to the effect that the non
discovery of a will after the death of the
testator raises the presumption that the
will was destroyed by the : testator; and
that a copy; of the same is not admissible
unless It can be proved that -the instru
ment was In existence at- the time of the
death of ;the maker" thereof. As such
could not ' be ; proved |In the case at bar
Judge Coffeyi sustained the .opposition to
tho.copy-^and'it was denied' admission to
probate. Â«l;:l^f ; ; . '. -\u25a0'"'_

waive his j rights remains to . be [seen. I Dr.
Hemphill says, however, that -he 'has not

LAWYERS GET NO CHANCE TO TALKâ
The Holland. Drcxel and West trading stamp
cases were before the Supreme Court yester
day. The attorneys acting In behalf of the
trading ' stamp and tobacco people and those
representing - the commercial men who secured,
the passage of the disputed law made up a
small army. The Justices. . after glancing at
the Imposing array of attorneys, ordered them
tn submit their arguments on briefs, thus
avoiding a ten days' talkfest.
"Don't be any noisier, than you can
help, "boys,"' said Patrolman "Charlie"
Brown, by way of kindly warning,
"and don't interfere with folk who
don't interfere with you."
" ,'Rah f o' Togo !" was the responsive
shout..
Several hours later, however, the ad
monition had' evidently been forgotten,
for the celebrants were making night
so hideous at California andv-Dupont
streets that they were again cautioned
by the same "Charlie" Brown. And it
was the same "Charlie" Brown who, at
2 o'clock a. m. Sunday, saw M. Segana
and Grant K. Dei, leaders of the crowd,
AV'hen vague rumor of a great Jap
anese naval battle triumph wafted over
the Asiatic Quarter of San Francisco
last Saturday evening ,M. "\u25a0 Segana'and
Grant K. Dei were t among the little
brown men who prematurely plunged
into joyous celebration. With a host
of- compatriots triey "toured the dis
trict, imbibed Nippon ghi "in unstinted
quantity and charted the war . songs
of. their native land, nor did an in
dulgent Chinatown squad seek to curb
their ebullitionary patriotism so long
as it did' not seriously fracture the
peace of a locality where peace is- ever^
unstable.

'.'The prison has been a -college to
her," says" kindly Marsllllo.Vannl^ hus
band of the woman who has supplied
a- home for the . youthful wife, whose
husband, accused of being one' of the
most fiendish of murderers, j Is stealth
ily evading the officers of the law.
Mrs. Torturici was released on her
own recognizance by Judge Lawlor
because she is soon to become a mother
again. The- police will keep a watch
to see that she does not try to leave
the city prematurely, of which, how
ever, they have no fear. She has been
given a home by Mrs. Julia Vanni of 8
Prescott court, who knew her brother
and his wife and in. that way became
acquainted with her- upon her arrival
in this city two years ago. As soon as
her case is disposed of the Italian Mu
tual Benevolent Society will send her
to her mother in New Orleans. .
\u25a0 Mrs. -Torturlci, though in this coun
try thirteen 'years, could neither speak
nor understand English when .she. en
tered the. San- Francisco City Prison.'
Now she can understand quite well
and can make herself understood in a
small- way. . She says she has learned
all this during her ..incarceration.
; The pretty young mother's incarcer
ation of nearly .two . months had
brought a paleness to her cheeks and
a languor .that seemed, broken . only
when she caressed ' the black-eyed
child she has kept with her in the
prison â the child whose eyes the
prison 'gloom could 'not keep from
dancing. Safe with friends a few
hours after her release,, the. young
woman's face was again wreathed in
smiles and she was very happy in the
thought that she would soon be with
her mother In a far-away "State.
Mrs. Rosa Torturici is free again.
The woman who is accused of being an
accomplice of her husband in the hor
rible murder of Blaggio Vilardo walk
ed from the prison yesterday with her
beautiful baby girl that half of the
women of San. Francisco would want to
adopt If their eyes could rest upon it.
The programme of sports for to-day
is a varied one and embraces nearly

Bradrick and Holling carried off the. honors
yesterday In .the- second day of the trap
shooting tournament at bluerocks at the Ingle
side grounds. . Tho two experts mada the high
scores of- 106 out of ' a possible \u25a0 120 j targets,
which .are records' both gunmen ' should be
proud of. The team shoot (or. the Union Gun
Club. trophy was captured by the Union... Gun
Club, which beat the Golden Gate team a
point for the trophy. The Union Club made
82 breaks out of 100. - - r fi>
Manager Morris Levy of the Hayes Val-"
ley. Club created Quite a bit . of surprise
along the line last night when he an
nounced that he had signed Jimmy Brltt
for a match in July, with the winner or
tbe Hanlon-Corbctt fight. Brltt has been
considering ' the match for a long time,
and he Quickly came to Levy's terms.
Brltt stated that he was tired of ban*?
ing around when he might as well bÂ«
picking 'up some money by donning tfiÂ»
mitts. He says he felt that he was en
titled to fight some. Inasmuch am Nelson
went Cast to meet all comers. Ho avers
It will be just as fair for him to fight as
It will be for Nelson, and that there *ls
no more danger of Us getting beaten
than the Dane. . .
The details of the match were, not ar
ranged by Britt and Levy at their meet
ing last night. Brltt is the drawing card
for the fight, and he figures on dictating
his own terms. The matter of weight or
referee was not discussed. It Is likely that
Brltt will meet either Corbett or Hanloa
at 132 pounds at 6 o'clock. â¢
It now looks as though the Brltt-Nelson
contest is further off than ever. "When
the Dane learns of Britfs Intention to
fight another in July he will not be thÂ»
happiest young man In thi world. HÂ«
did not figure on Britt slgnicjc to boas
anyone else. It is not likely .that thÂ«
Dane and the Native Son will come to- ,
gether before next winter.
Hanlon and Corbett are about reads
for their meeting on Friday night. Eddie
has had little difficulty on getting into
form, but the weight has not been com
ing off Corbett as rapidly as he would^
like. However, the little Denverlte Is
fast rounding Into "shape, and If every
thing goes right, he should be fit when
the bell taps.
The sale of seats for. the fight will open
this morning at 10 o'clock. Interest In the
fight is berag awakentd, and a larga
house la looked for. â¢

At the next moment every steam ves
sel within a radius of five miles, tugs,
yachts and launches, began the screech
ing concert wlthUheir. whistles. The
sailors on Pfeil gave hearty cheers,;as
did those on the yacht Norseman,
which the Atlantic's crew returned
with a will as the schooner set off her
signal lights. While this was going on
'she was answered by rockets from the
signal station on the shore. The Liz
ard light; kept flashing- and the Bcene
j THE LIZARD^ M&y ,29.^-With all her
sails' set, but "with not enough wind to
keep them from shaking, Wilson Mar
shall's \u25a0 beautiful- auxiliary three-mast
ed schooner Atlantic crossed the out-
Bide line between The Lizard and the
German dispatch' boat Pf ell Just as
night settled ; down' on the , English
coast, establishing anew. yachting rec
ord; of twelve days across the Atlantic
Ocean and' winning the great interna
tional race and the Kaiser's cup.
Formore than. three hours the racer
had been in sight from the stakeboat,
but-, nearly air afternoon- she had been
drifting along in what was .almos: a
dead calm. Indeed,' It | looked at one
time as. If the strong ..ebb tide would
carry, her backward. Finally, however,
there came a little puff and the Atlan
tic's bow reached the bar of the stake
boat, passing on the outside of the war
vessel. At that moment the .revolving
3,000,000-candle power lamp in the Liz
ard lighthouse, fell athwart her. The
Pfell discharged one of her biggest
guns, : thus declaring the- Atlantic the
winner. As the Pf ell's shot rang out
over the water a mighty cheer went up
from the, vast multitudes that lined the
shore. ; . '

was Intensely picturesque. The Atlan
tic kept on without stopping, as her
owner was anxious to make a. record
to Cowes. , \u25a0
The Atlantic passed Wolf Bock with
every stitch of sail set. Her spinnaker
was rigged to starboard and the
American ensign was at her peak-
Shortly afterward the wind dropped
and the spinnaker was taken In.
- Captain Barr was hailed by the cor
respondents' boat. He said the Atlantic
had made an average speed of ten and
one-half knots since leaving Sandy Hook.
As the Atlantic keeled her hull. showed
rust, but there was no sign of seaweed.
The Atlantic was flying the Interna
tional code letters "K. S. R. B." The
wind continued to lighten, and the yacht
was unable to finish before darkness set
In. .
After passing Scilly, the Atlantic was
becalmed, and had twelve hours to drift.
At the Lizard she met a tremendous sea
swell and for some time drifted backward
and forward. \u25a0
Captain Barr and Wilson Marshall, the
owner of - the \ Atlantic, . agreed that ' they
had made a splendid passage,- without a
single mishap, only experiencing onÂ©
strong gale, through which the boat rode
admirably.
. The record sail for one day was 311
knots, on May 24, which Mr. Marshall
believes beats anything hitherto achieved.
The Atlantic reached Bishop Lighthouse
(qputhwest of the main group of the
Scilly Islands) on May 29, .having accom
plished the passage to that point In
eleven days, sixteen hours and twenty
two minutes, with an average of ten and
a half knots per hour. ...
None of the competitors of the Amer
ican yacht Atlantic has yet been sighted.

When the case was called , yesterday morn
ing A. G. .Hagedorn. a member of the. Grand
Jury that tridicted Rebstock. was recalled for
the defense and asked as to whether Foreman
Ulienfeld had told -Rebstock he. need not testi
fy unless he liked, but the -memory of the wit
ness was not clear as to just- what had been
said. This closed the evidence for the de
fense. Am Istant District Attorneys Weller
and \VhU<nÂ» were called for. the prosecution
and testified they had no knowledge of the
character'Of the case the T3rand"Jury was Jn
vestieeting except that it was about frauds 'ln
the Altnshouse booth. This closed .the case for
the proscutlon.
"" There 'was a brief "consultation between the
attorneys and the Judge as to the*tlme to be
occupied- in p addressing tht Jury -and as to the
order In- which -counsel * would follow each
other. Attorney John A. Hosmer. who opened
for the prosecution, said he observed two or
three ladies' ln the courtroom and as he would
have to refer to language that waa not fit for
them to htar he suggested that they be asked
to leave. On reauest the women left/ Hos
roer corflned'his argument chiefly to a discus
sion' of the law bearing on the case, but In
doing co made reference occasionally to points
1n the evidence. He closed about 3:20 p. m.
and -Attorney* O'Grady and Newburgh asked
to be excused for a minute and retired to the
corridor. When they returned Attorney O'Grady
addreuincr the Judge said: "We waive, argu
ment.'' The District Attorney appeared to be
greatly disappointed.
The Judge said he was not prepared to in
struct the jury and as to-day was a holiday he
would continue the case till to-morrow after
noon at 1:30 o'clock.

rnitteeafter D'Ancona had given notice
that the committee- may recommend
that the city bury 1 Its own iridigfent
dead, instead of awarding a contract
for the same.
Scott also submitted a 'proposed or
dinance imposing a license tax of $2
per annum on horses and mules in
stead of on the vehicles as the present
ordinance provides. . The latter ordin
ance is" impossible of strict enforce
menfawd-many'people are evading'lthe
vehicle tax. The proposed new 'ordin
ance repeals the .license tax on wagons,
and provides that each ' horse shall
have conspicuously attached to the'
bridle a metallic "tag to be furnished
By the- Tax Collector and numbered
consecutively showing that the license
has been paid. The proposed license
is also designed to reach the horses of
the wealthy claps who are now exempt
from the vehicle tax.
The ordinance also appoints Louis
S.- Stone as supervising architect of the
school at a compensation of 2% per
cent of the contract price, and author
ires the appointment by the ' Board of
Supervisors of an assistant at a salary
of $200 per month when actually em
ployed to examine all work of con
struction and equipment of the build
ing.
Tax Collector Scott recommended an
Immediate amendment â¢to the theater
ordinance providing that "the Tax Col
lector shall refuse to issue any license
for any performance In buildings used
as theaters until a certificate in writ-
I ing of such approval \u25a0 shall have been
given by the Board of Works."
Scott says that the" Baldwin," Unique,
Novelty, Mission and Midway are not
paying the theater license, the last
named place not having paid for three
years' past. The Board of Works has
refused to issue the required permits,
but has been enjoined jfrorn. interfer
ing with the performances. As the law
stands, theaters which do not comply
with the ordinance are exempt from
the license tax, while those that do
comply pay the tax. The amendment
is designed" to remedy the evil and
was referred to the '-License- Com
mittee. " â¢ - ' !

for the increase in their salaries under

"Now York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. May 29.â The market for
ftockg in New York to-day was made almost
viii-iiy from London. The amount of busi
ness originating on ibis side was insignificant.
The â¢â¢"alinge for London accour.t were of an
arbitrage character, except for some apparent
demand for European account for the Japanese
bonds. Advance in prices in London afforded
opportunity for selling Americans in that
market and repurchasing ia New York at a
profit before they advanced to a parity here.
London took a very, hopeful view of the re
sults to follow the decisive defeat of the Rus
elan fleet and prospects for peace were be
lieved to "be brighter. All financial markets
Â«rÂ» agreed ac to the benefits of their own ;
eftairs of the termination of the war. The
isÂ«ue of the enormous war credits and British
disbursements have a certain effect of stim
ulation on the industries affected, but war
is destruction of capital and the unproductive
expenditure Involved must be paid for at the
time. The advantage to financial affairs of
.*a early peace therefor*, does not admit
cf question. There was a momentary hop*
that the Improvement of prices would prove
the needed factor to etlr the securities marr
kets out of their apathy, but the hope was
ethort lived so far as the New York market
was concerned. The great naval event failed
tÂ» bring back to town the large representa
tion among the brokers who had left on Fri
day-night with the determination to remain
oxer the Decoration day holiday. The higher
lrvel of prices established in sympathy with
London failed entirely to attract any demand
and there was a languid pressure of long
t-tocks at a few points, which served as an
additional discouragement. Tha United States
Bte*l stocks were heavy at the advance and
there was realizing in Ontario and Western
en last w*ek'Â« large rain. Tb* decision of the
Buprem# Court in favor of the New York State
franchise tax had been quite positively fore
seen and its only apparent effect wa* to drive
m. Tew uncovered shorts in The public franchise
stocks to cover.
Railroad traffic 'Officials reported some
tendency to the cuf ternary midseason dullness,
but expressed themselves on the . whole aa
well satisfied with the volume of traffic offer
ing. The April net earnings of 'the Wabash
ehowlcg a decrease of upward of 60 per cent
from those of the preceding April vai dis
appointing and rather emphasized the effect
o^ the poor showing made by the Atchlton.
The result in both cases was due largely to
the enhancement of operating cost. News of
weather conditions from the grain crops wai
tnrtre favorable. Prices dropped from neglect
during the midday period, but rose to the
beet in the final hour, making the closing
strong.
Dealings in the Japanese bonds dealt in on
the New York Exchange were on a large
scale and the three issues chow gains ranging
from S*Â» to 4 points. The bond market gen
ersl'y was dull and irregular. Total sales.
per "value. $7,020,000.
United State* bonds were all unchanged on

The cotton market was reverish and higher
to-day, due mainly to the war news from the
Far East.. The active future positions ad
vanced as much as 10 points and middling spots
quickly showed a gain or 3-16 c. Some of the
more ambitious traders were up at 5 o'clock
and wired buying orders to their Liverpool
brokers.
When our market opened the rush of buy-
Ing carried prices uo. 22 to 24 points from
Saturday's close before the scramble to buy
subsided. .There was enormous profit- taking
by old bulls and very heavy selling on South
ern orders and spot ' dealers against ' balance
of old crop. This latter \u25a0 sent the market
off 10 to 14 points from the top. but \u25a0 fresh
bull support and more outside buying pre
vented any further slump of importance.

wheat was oft l%c. Cofn.lsup .%@%c.VOats:
and provisions are practically unchanged. -. "."/\u25a0'.
,'â¢ Weakness ! prevailed In 7 the .-. wheat ,
from start to finish. At "the opening July was
oft %c at S9'/i@SÂ»%c to 89% c. The
decline was due to a variety. of; circumstances.
One of the; factors that i influenced trading ear
ly in tiie session was the decisive defeat of the
Russian 1 fleet, the inference : being : that \u25a0 peace
would probably, follow -soon.', With' peace :de-.
clared. grain markets ' in America ..would lose
an element of strength i that, for more than- a
year, has helped to hold prices at a' high level.'
A further source of weakness , was a sharp de
cline at Minneapolis, following continued liberal
receipts at : that \u25a0 point. K ln ; addition, 'j. weather!
conditions in the Unted' States .were considered
more' favorable .to the : growing ; plant, ;:. There'
wsi no-great yolumo of offerings, but selling
, by.*' pit', trader^ was persistent throughout the
entire session. Liquidation by small longs in
advance:of the. holiday to-morrow-was one of
the features Â»f the day. While some crop dam
age news was received, messages from the
Southwest to-day told 'in general an â¢entirely,
different story about, the whole crop* than was
in circulation â¢ last week. Fields \u25a0which wei-e
said to have given no promise a short time back
were to-day . reported as .show ing a: great Im
provement. One i message from Kansas â¢ City
declared that traders who .were predicting half
a ' crop ten days ago admitted now I that - there
has been an Improvement equal to 20 per cent.
Kansas, It wae claimed, would . raise between'
75,000.000 and 50.000.000 bushels if predictions;
of some well posted grain men; In that section;
were realized. ", Late in the session the market
became decidedly weak, July ; dclinlng to;88U
Â©BS%c. The close was practically at the low
est point of the day. July finished at 88%Â®'
ssk-c. , > --;\u25a0 :- \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 .. \u25a0 -Â±i
Considering the weakness of. wheat, the corn
market was remarkably strong. The strength
was larjrely the 'result .of a. .persistent demand
trom several prominent commission houses for
the July option. ' The ' buoyancy of to-day
seemed to indicate that the market had been
largely oversold last week. Business ' on" the
whole was of â¢ small volume. July closed -at
49c. a gain of '<.<S>&c. May closed lUc higher
at Sic. ' , : - \u25a0 \u25a0 ' \.
Wet weather caused a firm undertone in the
oat market. July closed practically un
changed at .lOVjc. Xf'.i
Provisions were a trifle easier as a result of
a decline in the price of hogs: At the close
July pork was oft 2VaC. lard was off a shade
and ribs were ' unchanged. - â¢

' JOHN J. DOYLE. Auctioneer.The Ircquois Club filed resolutions urging
the board to waste no morÂ» time in vÂ«in ef
forts to acquire any water supply which has
been refused by the Secretary of the .^lnterior,
Geflrge E. Gray submitted a proposition (hat
omnibus automobile carriages be placed on the
Geary-i!treÂ»t lines instead of converting It Into
an electric system. Gray, who signs himself
as an honorary member of the Society of Civil
Engineers, says his suggestion, if carried out,
would result in A great saving in original cost
and maintenance. It was referred to the Util
ities Committee.
Owing to a clerical error In the lan
guage of the. municipal budget the
Board of Supervisors was- â¢ compelled
yesterday to pass the ordinance thereon
to sprint again, in order that it might
not be invalidated owing to a techni
cality. The errer arose under the head
ing of street, sweeping and cleaning,!
which designated that the work be
done by the ctty anil not contract. The
words "not by contract" were stricken
out so that it. will be possible to have
the work done by contract if found de
sirable. The ciyil service requirements
for the employment of subordinates in
that connection were abolished^ so far
as ; the teaming for "street' cleaning is
concerned. [Another amendment wiJI
permit the CJity Engineer to appoint an
additional draughtsman. Â« '

ferred to the Joint Committee on Judiciary,

impounded for being at large. The com

of extortion made by Mozetti to the effect
that he had paid money to Deputies Unger
and Edwards so his cows could graze. on
the hills surrounding his corral. The Joint
committee will take up the investigation
next Thursday at 2 p. m.
Action was not taken before some of the
Supervisors had engaged in a lively
wrangle on the subject; Rea claimed that
Secretary Holbrook of the" Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals which
conducts the -pound, had cast reflections
on hl3? character as a city official.
\u25a0 "Mr. Holbrook has insinuated that Mo
zoUi and his friends had been induced to
swear falsely, before the Police Commit
tee, which made a partial investigation
of the bribery charges," said Rea. "Hol
brook also said that $150 was paid to
Mozetti to make the charges against
Unger. I am without fear or favor in this
matter and I demand that the charges be
probed to the bottom. I will have some
thing to say,: then : that will cause sur
prise." ' \:;
Eggers thought that In view of^the
threatened scandal hinted at by Rea the
investigation should be ta!Â»en up by 'the

refer it to the committee named,

skin broke out with a humor. I took
her to a doctor, who said it was
eczema. He. gave me medicine to
give her, but she kept getting worse
all the time. Her little face and body
were so covered with sores and large
.scales, you could not tell what she
looked -like." No child ever had a
worse case.' Her face was being eaten
away; and even her finger nails fell
off. -Then it itched so she could not
sleep, and for. many \u25a0weary nights we â¢
could get no rest. . At last we got
Cuticura Soap and" Ointment,, first
bathing her in warm water with the
Soap, and then spreading on the Ointâ
" ment with soft cloths. . I saw a change
in a week. The sores began to heal,
and she could sleep at night, and in
