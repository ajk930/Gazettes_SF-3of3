"Code" Among Midshipmen
Calls for Encounter to Put
End to Disputes.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ANNAPOLJS. Md.. Nov. 22.âMidship
man Minor Meriwether Jr. of Lafayette,
La., a member of the third class of the
Naval Academy, was put on trial here
to-day before a naval court-martial on
charges that include that of manslaughter
in having caused the death of Midship
man James R. Branch Jr. of New York,
a member of the class above him, as a
result of a prearranged list fight which
took place on the evening of Sunday, No
vember 5, last.
The sad incident of the death of young
Branch under such circumstances has
been widely noticed and has called at- !
ttntion to the existence at the Naval
Academy of an unwritten code govern
ing the student body, but quite outside
the authoritative rules and generally In
violation of them. Under the "code,"
every detail of these fights is fixed, the
midshipmen on duty abstaining from re
porting them and excusing from forma
tion those connected with them. These,
facts were very clearly brought out in the
crcss-fxasilsaUOTZ- try7-il]Wtenant--*Â»onjr;
masder Robison, for the defense.
The witnesses to-day included Branch's
roommate, the referee, the timekeeper of
the contest and all four seconds. All
were examined in a more or less degree
about the circumstances of the fight, the
"code" and the ideas of the cadets as to
their duty under the regulations. The
"code" system was not directly put on
trial, although it was very thoroughly
ventilated along some lines.
Midshipman A. W. Fitch, who refereed
the fight which was followed by Branch's
death, stated that he had officiated in
nineteen such contests and Midshipman
McKittrlck testified that he had taken
part in nine. Detailed accounts were
given of the arrangements by which mid
shipmen on duty acquiesced in absences
without leave and other derelictions in
order that the fight might go on. The
testimony also showed that although fre
quently severe injuries resulted from
these fights and the recipients often had
to be taken to the hospital, nothing fur
ther was ever heard of them. This th<*
defense brought out on cross-examina
tion, it being evidently Intended to show
that the authorities also winked at the
code and the prearranged fights under it.
RULES OF THE "CODE."
Interesting sidelights on hazing: or
'Tunning-," as it is called at the acad
emy, developed from the testimony of
one of the midshipmen. Meriwether
has been generally disliked, he said,
because he was too "ratty." that is,
it was explained be did not abide by
the rules laid down for the govern
ment of the lower classmen. Some of
these were that he should never enter
"Lovers' Lane," an academy walk; that
he should turn all corners at right
angles, should not look at an - upper
classman, and should answer most re
spectfully when addressed by one of
them; that he must never touch the
table nor ask for anything during a
meal, and under no circumstances
"fuss," that is, be in the society of
young women.
These rules and many others are
contained in that part of the "code"
relating: to the government of under
class men. Branch had been one of
the midshipmen who, according: to the
testimony, determined to make life
**not worth living" for Meriwether,
because he would not abide by these
rules, and from that the enmity arose.
Midshipman Earl W. Prltchard was
the roommate of Branch and . is also
from Louisiana. His testimony' was of
the utmost Importance, covering the
whole facts in the incident that led di
rectly to the fight. Meriwether had,
he gaid, come to the room occupied
by himself and Branch, accompanied
by Midshipman Yeager. ' Meriwether
accused Branch of acting unfairly to
ward him by using his official posl-
Hon as midshipman in charge of the
floor to report him about the matter
of a dress suit case containing civilian
clothes, and charged Branch with
having a grudge against him. The
latter Branch admitted. Meriwether
then said that Branch was a "low
down sneaking coward."
Branch then told Meriwether that
his class could compel him to leave
the academy, and to this Meriwether
answered that he did not care if they
did. that he was not going to be used
badly by any one. ;
After Meriwether and Yeager had
left Branch asked the witness what
he should do, and was told that a
fight was necessary. Afterward Branch
had told him that he hart not
reported Meriwether. An upper class
man, Noyes, had spoken to him about,
it and he had come to the conclusion
that it would be a dirty trick to do so.
FIGHT TWEVn-TWO ROUNDS.
Midshipman Harold V. McKlttrick,
who acted as a second for Branch dur
ing the flght/ told of their engagement
and the Insistence of both . boys that
the fight should be to a finish. The
fight Itself, he-t estified,, lasted 'over,
twenty-two rounds of two minutes
each, with 'one minute â¢- Intermission.'

Miss Roosevelt attended the game be

DENVER BANK
HOLDS $30,000
IN HER NAME
Advertisement Conveys
News to a Belmont
Special Dispatch to The Call.
DENVER, Nov. 22.â Mrs. M. C. Dob
son of Belmont, Cal.. is believed to be
entitled to 530,000 awaiting a claimant in
a Denver bank. She is the widow of
Charles A. Dobson, who owned an in
terest in mining property near Aspen,
Colo. Recently this/ property was sold,
and, as her whereabouts was ' unknown,
the other owners advertised â¢ for her,
stating that her dead husband's share
was $30,000.
Mrs. Dobson has retained Charles D.
Hayt of Denver as her attorney and will
come to Colorado to establish her claim.
The advertisement was published five"
months ago, but she saw it only a few
days ago.
Dobson was killed by an explosion fif
teen years ago, and soon after the acci
dent Mrs. Dobson and her family, re
moved to California. However, both are
well remembered at Aspen. As, soon as
she arrives Attorney Hayt will go to As
pen with her to seek old acquaintances.
was closed, but he was holding his
own. At the end of the twentieth
Meriwether fouled by hitting in a
clinch and offered to forfeit the fight.
This Branch and hrs seconds would not
allow, insisting on a finish.
Another time Branch was on his
knees and* under the rules., could have
been hit, but Meriwether would not hit
him. Both of these were points in
Meriwether's favor. '
On cross-examination an effort, was
made to show by the witness that
fights generally had the effect of abro
gating the ill-feeling \u25a0 between the
fighters. The witness said that It was
always the custom to have a general
handshaking. at the close of the fights
and that this was done In this case.
Meriwether, he said, begged the par
don of Branch for .the ' insulting lan
guage he had used and the apology" was
accepted.
Earl \V. Pr 'chard, the roommate of
Branch/was recalled to tell all the cir
cumstances connected with Branch's
treatment after the fight. He said that
Branch' had been given' a hot; shower
bath and treated with towels soaked in
hot water and applied to his head and
body. Branch, he said, ha>l com
plained about soreness in one arm and
parts of his;. head, but 'bad' talked
nat"rally about the fight and other
matters. Prlchard had" noticed some
movement of the log during Branch's
sleep, but bad thought nothing about it.
The witness retired at 2 v a., m. . and
arose at" s:3o a. m. He then saw that
Branch was , unconscious and oneV leg
and Â» arm bad . a convulsive , movement;
He then notified the medical ' authori
ties. Midshipman Prichard; said that
when- Branch first' returned to his, room
in his weakened Condition he hod sug
gested a drink of wUlsky as a stimulant,"
but that Branch refused it, saying \ he
had promised: his father not to taste
intoxicants until he was 25 years of

So hopeless was the tangle in which
some of the inspectors found themselves
that it . was necessary to Insert figures
practically arbitrary in the returns where
figures were found to be omitted. In one
set of returns eight errors were found.
Hearst made a gain approximately of
twenty-three votes as a result of
the day's work. According to -the state

proportionate gain of a little- more than
one vote to an election district, which
means that, if continued, his total gain

means of guaranteeing the authority of
the Government, the pacification of the
country and the support of the people's
representatives,, are the immediate pro
mulgation of universal suffrage in elec
tions to the Douma, the transformation
of the first Douma into a constituent As
sembly, with the approbation of the Em-,
peror of a constitution for the Russian
empire and the organization of territorial
reforms.
"Measures for the realization of the'
liberties granted by the manifesto are re
garded as immediately Imperative.
"It must, moreover, devolve upon the
Douma to establish a fundamental basis
for land reform and to decidÂ© any mo
mentous Question In the domain of. labor
legislation."
The resolution concludes by enumerat
ing various measures which, it says, must
bo carried out before the Douma meets.
These include investigations Into the re
cent occurrences in various parts of the
country, the trial of local officials and
police who became culpably involved in
the disorders, the maintenance of public
security, the proclamation of full amnesty
for political and religious offense3 up to
the date of the Imperial manifesto, and
the abolition of capital punishment
SOCIALISTS ARE DISGRUNTLED.
M. Guehkoff and Count Hayden opposed
not only the demand for a constituent As
sembly, but also that for direct elec
tions, for they said Russia was not suf
ficiently developed.
\u25a0M. Guchkoff, who is regarded as Count
de Wltw's spokesman, defended martial
law, saying that extraordinary musurea
were necessary in extreme cases. He waa
continually interrupted by cries of
"EnoughÂ£%from ; the. Socialists in the au
dience "and the" extremist delegates. - j
.Prince Troubetskoy rebuked the disturb
ers.- He said he was opposed to martial
law, especially in Poland,- but the dole
gates ought to give a respectful hearing
to all opinions, especially if they werÂ©
unpopular.

gress saying the delegates had sold them
selves to the Government, but that the
Socialists would show them, up to the peo
ple as traitors and would continue to
prosecute the campaign for a democratic
republic.
The Socialists also created a scene m
the Congress of peasants, which opened
here to-day and to which they demanded
admittance, with the right to vote. The
Congress refused to grant the right to
vote, whereupon the Socialists left in a
huff after declaring that the peasants did
not know who were their best frlend3.

MOSCOW, Nov. 22.â The excitement
among the peasants in the central and
southeastern provinces Is spreading rap-
Idly, and It is feared that It will bo im
possible to suppress the movement, which
promises to develop into a general upris
ing, bringing devastation and untold hor
ror to the whole country.' The revolution
ists among the peasants are industriously
spreading the story that the Imperial
reform manifesto . really ' decreed : a di
vision of the lands, but that the nobles.
Intelligence and Jews distorted 7it and
took all the freedom, for themselves, and
the peasants, therefore, â¢ have the right
to possess themselves of the lands which
the Emperor granted them.
The ' peasant congress will , assemblo
here to-morrow. It is largely under tha
domination of men from the villages
who. during residence in the cities, hava
become Imbued with socialistic Ideas.
These men are preaching the expulsion ot
i the landlords and the division of the es
tates and are advocating the refusal o*
the peasants to pay taxes until . a con
stituent assembly la called. Some of th>j
radical member* of the Zemstvo" con
gress are in negotiation with leading
members , of the peasant congress.

Special Dispatch to The Call,
SACRAMENTO. Nov. 22.-Stephen Jt f
Neal, believed to be the largest benefit
ciar>' under the will of Mrs. Ora Runyon
Buckman, was denied the privilege to at
tend her funeral this afternoon. He twice
applied to Mrs. Runyon. mother of the
dead heiress, to be allowed to follow her.
daughter's body to the grave, butyeach
time was refused. . Then he resorted to
Judge Shields of the Superior Court for
an order 1 of court commanding Mrs. Run
yon, as special administratrix of the es
tate, to allow him to enter the residence
i hat he might for tho last time look upon
Mrs, Buckman's face. Judge Shields held
that he was without jurisdiction in the
matter. Xeal seemed lo master his grief
sufficiently, however, to utter' a roast of
a., the Runyon kith and kin. He prefaced
his statement by saying that unlike Mrs.
Runyon he. had waited .until after the
funeral before making a statement, and
then added: t
Mns. Runyon'g charges against me are based
en. the ctatementH of dissatisfied relatives and
othtr j>erronf> whose attempts to take ad
vantage of "Mrs. Buckman I had foiled.
For several years .Mrs. Runyon made no
settlement with her daughter In their joint
business deals although the latter had .re
)*atedl>v asked for a settlement. Finally, in
1004. Mrs. llurkman called upon her -mother
lor a settlement oi their partnership affairs,
which Mrs. Runyon put off from time to time,
until, through my efforts, a partial settlement
was effected early this year, af ter , the dis
covery of errors amounting to several thousand
dollars against Mrs. Buckman in* the accounts
submitted by Mrs. Runyon.
Ag the result of this settlement Mrs. Run
yon was forced to pay her daughter over
$10,000. â¢
Immediately after Mrs. Buckman became
critically ill Mrs. Rtmyon began to till the
house with her relatives. One by one they
came from far and near. Though I felt that
tIV presence of so many people in the house
would disturb Mrs. Buckman, and I bo in
formed Mrs. Runyon, ?he paid no attention
to what I said and day by day the number
of her relatives Increased until they . were
about twenty-nine - present.' occupying every
room in the house.
While Mrs. Buckman was in full possession
of her faculties she made a will.- Afterward
a most unseemly .gtrutrgle wa* carried on over
her bed.- on one side of which sat Mrs; Run
yon. on the other Mrs. Rlppon, each urging:
the dying: woman to revoke what she had done.
I do not know mypelf the contents of the
will. Since her death I have not tried to
ascertain. I have not attempted to do any
thing: In this matter before the funeral, prÂ»
ferring-to wait until Mrs. Buckman is buried
before determining- howto ascertain any rights

an ' annulment of the marriage ; and the
setting aside of 'a deed'to'l7s acres of val
uable farm land in this county which he
transferred to his wife immediately 'after
the bedding.- ,'. - , ' '}.
The complaint , sets forth' that LJctfau,
who is feeble andln""poor health, was "ap
proached by W. B. Stacknouse and coun
seled to marrjt the* woman, who was
recommended' as an honorable, virtuous
person who -would make -him a good

woman and . Staqkhouse -made - Lichau
believe that his' children were going* , to
have', a- guardian appointed for him and
take a. way hiss property. -To save' the
property -he was induced to deed the, 175
acres to . her/on . the â¢ promise that she
would "at once file a declaration of home
stead. She.has thus* far failed to. file the
homestead. \ " .. ",.-r-'. ....-,.;
* The "comDlaint 1 further, alleges' : that
while' Stackhouse liad /denied . that /-.the
woman: was j anything to- hinior- ever had
been, the 'fact is that ? he M-as' married to
, her November j 21, 1884, and that they
lived together.- as husband and wife up
to January, 1889, when .they w;ere di
vorced in Yolo â¢ County and that 'the de
cree of divorce awarded the minor' child
of the: couple to; the father, as. the mother
had. Vbeen for a. long. tim%jiast an;aban
doned woman, addicted' to ' the use of in
toxicating drinks^that she ls;a.i)erson of
character and : disposition, conduct, knd
temper, wholly unfit to have the care,
management and custody of said child."
, The plaintiff then avers, on information
and belief that -.the . defendant at ..the
time .of her marriage to him, and "long
prior thereto, was of immoral character,'
and that on. July. 11, 1899,' she was>arrest
ed at .^'oodland for consorting | with a
tramp. . .; >
The complaint closes with the state
ment that 1:'1 :' "on .no' account, or under no
circumstances can. the plaintiff permit a
woman of such vile character to longer,
bear his name," and he prays the court
to immediately annul, vacate and set aside
the marriage and declare him free from
the -bonds which unites him to her; also
that the deed to the land be vacated, set
aeide^arid.aiinuiled on, the ground that It
was secured 'by conspiracy and under the
grossest misrepresentations while he was
ill and feeble and acting under fear!

DECLARE WAR
ON HUMPHREY
AJ askan Delegates Will Now
Attempt to Prevent His
11 ecognition by Congress
FIOHT GROWING BITTER
Friends of Johanson Allege
Successful Candidate Is
â¢Not Eligible to Office
Special Dispatch to Tha Call.
SEATTLE; Wash., Nov. 22â Vowing
vengeance for the defeat of Carl Johan
son as a Delegate to Congress, a majority
of the delegates : to the Alaska Territorial
Convention left the city to-night for other
States on business and : pleasure. The
convention adjourned sine die at 3 o'clock
this afternoon, but not before a compact
had been entered into by the friends of
Judge ,\Vicker3ham ' that Omar.'J. Hum
phrey, who received ..the honor sought by
Johanson, . should never take a seat in
Congress as a representative of Alaska.
To start the' fight' it is" being published
broadcast that Humphrey, who is general
manager of the Alaska Commercial Com
pany at Seattle, is a voter In the State of
Washington and not entitled to a vote in
Alaska and . therefore not competent to
represent the district in Congress. As a
second'mbve^ against the will of , the con
ventton, Congress .will be asked not to~
break the established precedent of seating
more than one Delegate, which has al
ways been the rule regarding Territories.
It is pointed;out" that" Wickersham hav
ing the support of the President, in his
appointment, will be ,able to wield a
power or permit* such to be wielded by
his friends in the national capital, and
this faction is in a position to not only
seriously retard the execution of : the will
of the convention but leave Alaska prob
ably in a' worse condition than before
the meeting of delegates here.
The Fairbanks and Tanana delegations
are" not pleased with the outcome and,
while divided' against themselves, a ma
jority are credited with being in the ranks
to fight Humphrey. , - ,
De"piity United States 'Marshal Lathrop
of yaldez, who held .Wickersham's proxy,
together with several others pledged to
Johanson, and who failed to attend the
convention and deliver the" votes which
would/ have elected a Tanana man,
was. not hobnobbing with the delegates
to-day. He has left the city and reports
are current, which'it is impossible to ver
ify, that he willnot return to Alaska. In
the event of Humphrey being shut out it
is believed that Southeastern Alaska will
withdraw its Delegate, former Governor
A, P. Swinef ord. " and allow Richard S.
Ryan of Nome to be the sole representa
tive at Washington- of the district.' This
course will be taken if it will promote
harmony which the Southeast is anxloua
to secure or in the event of Congress re
fusing-to seat' the three Delegates.-
There were not more than half the dele
gates present at the closing session. The
principal business was hearing the final
report of the committee on resolutions.
Among those passed' was a resolution pro
vldingt "We recommend that a commis
sion' composed of two members of Con
grejs \u25a0 and one resident of Alaska, learned
lnithelaw and-'of-at least three -years* .
residence in Alaska and practice in the
district, be created for th^ purpose of re
vision otÂ» the .civil and criminal*' annotated
code_oÂ£ thetproCedureiOf: Alaska."; .
: Another -resolution provides that "The
Congress of the United States be and is
hereby requestexi to amend the municipal
incorporation" Jaw of the. district of Alas
ka and authorizes â¢;.. any municipality to
vote to extend its corporate limits. Re
solved; that the private corporation law
of- Alaska be amended so as to include
Alaska â¢be amended so as to -'include
banks."Â»- \u25a0 \u25a0 '
Tho last act of the convention was a
consideration of a report of the finance
committee.: This showed $50 lacking to
pay for getting out a report of the pro
ceedings. Delegate-elect Humphrey set
tled the matter by requesting that all ex
penses in connection with a report of the
convention be sont to him. , \u25a0 \u25a0 .

STATE MINERS
ARE IN SESSION
Meet in Annual Convention
at Nevada City to Dis
cuss Existing Conditions
GOVERNOR IS PRESENT
President Benjamin Delivers
an Interesting : Address
to Assembled Delegates
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEVADA, Nov. 22.â The fourteenth an
nual convention of the California State
Miners' Association was called -to order
at the Nevada Theater this morning by
President Edward \u25a0 J. Benjamin of San
Francisco, who spoke in part as follows:
We have again , assembled In annual conven
tion for the purpose of discussing existing con
ditions, and to, unite In a lurther effort to fos
ter and advance the Interests of the sreat basic
Industry of our State;'<the. industry to which
California owes Its * prominence In the past;
the Industry upon which her people must large
ly depend for future success, for upon the pros
perity of the mineral Industry permanently
rests the prosperity of the country. \
From the early history of California the
miner has had to fight his battles, alone. The
Government, both . State and Federal, has al
ways shown a very decided tendency to aid
the agriculturist in anj way, but the miners
hare actually had to tight for their rights am)
overcome their difficulties as best they might.
Whenever there have been contest* between the
farmer and the miner in the Land Office the
United States Court or the Federal depart
ments the miner has been given the "short
Â«nd." >-â¢.â¢â¢;\u25a0>
It seems to me that It is pretty near tims
that somÂ» consideration . should be shown us
when we esk for new laws or for Governmental
recognition. .
.."What other State or what other country can
show an average annual output- of gold of
$25,250,000 for nfty-stx consecutive years, and
what State can &how a yield in any single
year of over $81,000,000, or a production of
over $30,000,0C0 a year, for flve consecutive
years as California did in the fifties? And
what State or what- country or what petiple,
except California and her courageous 'miners,
can show- a total mineral production now of
nearly $44,000,000 annuallyâ and , that, too.
with the great Industry . of hydraulic mining
crippled and forced into idleness . for years by
adverse legislation? We often hear the : charge
that the California gold mines are worked out.
Does not our, present production of $19,000, 000
annually answer \ that ridiculous, statement?
And are we to he put off from â¢ year to year
In our .request* for- new laws, 'for new condi
tions and for a public policy that will meet
our requirements? I say' no! We want a
Government Department of Mines and Mining,
where we .can get a square deal. We want
our public land policy so regulated \u25a0 that . the
miner will have an equal : show with ' \u25a0 the
farmer. "As It Is now the miner is forced to
pay f 2 50 per acre for â¢ his land, and the
farmer gets his for $1 23. The miner is al
lowed to locate twenty-acre tracts and the
farmer 100 acres. \
Governor Pardee addressed the miners
on behalf of the State, making a short
but interestine address full of good
wishes 'for the miners. Fred Searls de
livered ," a short address of welcome on
behalf of Nevada City.
After; reading President Benjamin's an
nual report at -"the*- afternoon session.
Judge John F. , Davis, chairman of the
committee on legislation, filed a lengthy
report, showing, what the association has
done for the mining industry in the way
of securing favorable j legislation. \u25a0
. . Professor S. B. Christy, dean of thÂ«
College of Mines at the State University,
delivered an, address, "which conoluded
the afternoon session.
j A brilliant reception was tendered the
visitors to-night at the Nevada Theater.
The address : of I welcome^ was { made _' by.
City Attorney I.'- Â£._ LJndley. - Responses,
were made by President ' Benjamin, Gov-'
errior Pardeer Vice President' C M.~Dun
ton, Senator. C. M. Belshaw, Judge, John
F. Davis, besides a select musical pro
gramme. '.\u25a0\u25a0*. \u25a0
There will be â¢no session to-morrow.
The delegates will leave for Grass Val

tha. rpeople there for: one day.:

Plotters Captured in Uaid
at San Juan de Martinez
HAVANA, Nov. 22.â Sixty Remington
rifles were seized by the poiice last night
in a raid on a house near San Juan de
Martinez, province of Pinar del Rio, in
\u25a0which fifty anti-Government plotters were
meeting. A dozen of the latter were cai>
tured.
Colonel Julian Cruz, a prominent citi
zen of Pinar del Rio, and at present In
Havana, has been arrested in connection
\u25a0writh the anti-Government movement, and
will be taken to Pinar del Rio for trial.
The investigation of the evidence in con
nection with the finding of arms and am
munition at Cerro last Sunday is pro
ceeding with much care. The Govern
ment has intimated that it has no desire
that arrests be piade and prosecutions be
gxm unless very decisive evidence* is ob
tained, and in the event of this not devel
oping the matter will be dropped after
the election.
General Freyre Andrade. Secretary of
the Interior, said to-night that it had been
the belief of the Government that the
conspirators had other stores of arms and
ammunition In the provinces of Havana
and Pinar del Rio, but that after a thor
ough investigation the officials were satis
fied that no arms were secreted In any of
the other provinces. The Secretary said
that he had reason to believe that a few
rash loaders of the Liberal party were
Instigating petty conspiracies by con
stantly denouncing the Government to
Their easily led following. The Secretary,
while of the opinion that there would be
no ante-election trouble, said- he was
certain that two days would be the
limit of any attempt at Insurrection.

DUEL FOUGHT
ON YARDARM
Two Barkentine Sailors Set
tle Grudge With Knives'
While' a Storm Is Eagiiig
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Nov. 22.â Fighting a
duel on the yardarm with sheath
knives in a gale at midnight off Hat
teras, Ole Janssen, a sailor, was nearly
killed on the barkentine Minnie Swan,
which is berthed at the foot of Nine
teenth street, Jersey City.
Emilio Huelatta, a Porto Rlcan sailor,"
was held In $5000 bail by United
States Commissioner Lindsay to-day in
Jersey City, charged with attempted
murder on the high seas.
CajStain H. I. Higgins is the skipper,
of the barkentine. On a previous" trip
to Porto Rico Huelatta had been
shipped, and hardly had he come
aboard when he and Janssen, a Swede,
began to quarrel. From Fernandina
the Minnie Swan, lumber laden, set
out for New York twelve days ago. Off
Hatteras all hands were called at mid
night to shorten sail. Janssen was or
dered to take in the fore topgallant
sail, and. not thinking of the feud be
tween the men, an officer' \ ordered
Huelatta to help him.
What occurred aloft before blows
were exchanged only the two sailors
know. A minute later those on deck
heard the criÂ«s of Janssen, and in
flashes of lightning saw the two men
slashing at one another with their
sheath knives. \u25a0
Three sailors ran up the ratlines and
found Janssen.' clinging to the yard
arm, almost unconscious from a knife
wound in his breast. They took him
to the deck and then returned 'for
Huelatta, who was at the end of the
yardarm and fought off his captors
with his feet and brandished his knife.
Finally they threw a noose over his
head, broke his hold and lowered him
head foremost to the deck, when Cap
tain Higffins and his officers were
ready to receive him with revolvers
drawn.
Huelatta was put into Irons and
Janssen went into the sick bay. When
the vessel docked he was taken to the
Jersey City Hospital.

L,aws to Promote Honesty "Are
Suggested by Equitable Man.
Would Make Public All Trans
actions by Managers
NEW YORK, Nov. 22.â Aftei being
on the witness stand before the Arm
strong legislative committee on insur
ance investigation! for the greater part
of three days. Gage E. Tarbell, second
vice president of the Equitable Life
Assurance Society, finished his . testi-'
mony to-day and just before adjourn
ment submitted - a list of suggestions
for the remedying of. existing abuses
in the management of insurance com
panies and for legislation: designed to
give the State proper control over the
companies and to insure the confidence,
of the pqlicy holders. ' Prominent
among these suggestions was absolute
publicity. Admitting that â¢ wrong, had
been done by life insurance officials,
Tarbell said he had no â¢ apologies to
make for any of them and that he
hoped they would be punished.
Tarbell was on the stand the entire
day and was questioned as to the sys-'
tern of -'agencies and the commissions
and other 'compensations allowed them
for getting business. Just before the
recess the fact was brought out that
Tarbell had taken out insurance on his
own life and on members of his fam
ily, and had received the agent's com
mission on the premiums, as well as
renewal commissions. He said, that
since he became an officer he had taken
out $200,000" on his own life in the
Equitable. Besides , his .'policies in- the
Equitable he had taken out Insurance
in the New York Life, the arrange
ment being made with George W. Per
kins and on this, too, he received the
commission on the premiums. He also
had policies in the Aetna and the, Tra
velers, on all of which he collected /the
commissions. He said he â¢ carried
$400,000 on his own life and $100,000
on members of his family. j
DEi\OU.\CES REBATING SYSTEM.
Tarbell was emphatic in denouncing
the system of rebating by agents and
stated that any agent of the Equitable
who gave rebates to get business was
dismissed. When he told of having
got the commissions Assemblyman Cox
asked if that was not rebating, and
Tarbellsaid it was not: that he
thought he was entitled to it. .
Later, when Hughes took up this
same subject with the witness, the lat
ter justified the taking of the commis
sions as being similar to the case of a
merchant who purchased goods of^a
fellow-merchant in the same line, ;per-:
haps to fill an order, and got those
goods at cost, or of a professional man
treating another and : charging less
than the regular fees. -i \u25a0\u25a0 Tarbell. further?
said if he had done wrong he * was
sorry, *but that he had acted in good
faith.
Tarbell bore out in a measure the
statement of James H. Hyde when on
the stand relative to the fairness of the
Frink report. The subject of advances
to agents was under investigation, and
Hughes read some figures of the amount \u25a0
of advances to one agent in thisÂ»city.
Hughes asked where the Frick commit
tee got the figures/and Tarbell replied
with marked asperity that he did not
know. m ,
"They did riot get them from my de
partment or the auditor's. They made
their report' without ever* making an
investigation of the department," he
said.
TRAVELING EXPENSES NOT LARGE.
As to the expense incurred by the
oflicers of the Equitable, Tarbell said
he personally never had any expenses
except those that he turned in in an
itemized account. His traveling ex
penses last year amounted to $4675.
On one of these trips he had a private
oar. This was on a trip of n month
to the South and West to attend agency
meetings. . The total expenses of the
trip were $1959. On the trip with the
witness were Mrs. and Miss Tarbell,
Ur. Wells, H. R. Winthrop, Mr. Gorhani.
secretary to Mr. Tarbell. and T. A.
Woods.* The witness said the expenses
of Airs. Tarbell and his daughter were
not paid by the Equitable Life.
Tarbell said that a private car with
him is a workshop on wheels. His busi
ness is carried on In this way, and he
does not lose a day or get behind. His
car generally has ,free transportation,
so that there is a saving in expenses.
The free transportation also is extend
ed to the occupants of the car. Tlw
Kquitablc Society owns a private car.
The witness thought that the railroads
extended these privileges to life insur-'
ance companies because the ; latter have
been large. patrons in buying 'railroad
securities. . The railroad officials. I were
glad, he said, to have life insurance of
ficials go ovtr the roads and see the
conditions the roads were in. He also
took these trips In lieu of vacations. In
some Instances, the witness said, he
had free transportation^ even though
he had no private car. .
COST OP AGENTS' CONVENTIONS.
Tarbell was asked who paid the ex
pense of, agents' conventions, to which
he replied: \u25a0 '\u25a0 ' \u25a0 " â
"Some times the Equitable. pays half
and the general agent tho other half."
Ha said the convention -of, general
agents at Manhattan Beach last .Sep
tember cost the Equitable Society a lit
tle less than J50.000. A general agents'
convention iv the previous April â¢ cost
$15,000. ," '- .? â¢ ; ;
"It has been said that $45, 000, was "put
into the hands of one' agent for distri
bution among the others,": said Hughes.
"Thatis not'so. ;Not;ss; Not;$5 wasput into
any one's hands for distribution "\u25a0 said
Tarbell. . J ; ; â¢ \
He said, -that, he .did not believe the
society's expenses for- agents', conven
tions approximated '.$75,000 or $100,000
a year.; \u25a0"\u25a0.\u25a0. : . : * ; .? \u25a0 , A~~fii'\^'.
\u25a0 The statement of advances toagents

â¢â¢Where did the Frick committee get
this $39,400?" -
"I never knew anything about where
the Frick. committee got these figures.
They did not get them from Vmy, de
partment or the auditor's. .They, made
their, report' without ever making an
investigation of the department."
Toward, the- close' of .:hls. testimony
Tarbell took occasion to make a state
ment, in which he said: v "\
"I cannot believe that anything that
(has occurred in the life insurance busi
ness can be \u25a0 traced :10 a large \u25a0f^ plus
of a life Insurance company, bemuse if
a man is going to be dishonest he can
be dishonest with the^reserve dollar or
any other dollar as easily as with a sur
plus dollar. .
"I am inclined to believe 'that the things
- they have done, or that, the things that
have: taken place, occurred because a
great many people have : been jj afflicted
during the last few years with. If I might
be permitted to so term it, money: mad
nessâa desire to get rich perhaps too
. quickly. But these things can occur
anywhere," and they do occur everywhere.
In fact, while I have no apologies what
ever to make for anybody who has done
I wrong in i..s business, I thin<t that those
who have been derelict in their duty
I should be punished. I uo not know that
i it is to be wondered that some dirt should
have crept' into business in , some places,
and I am glad to see that there are. men
in this business who saw the dirt, men
who endeavored to cause it to be swept
! out and who are glad, to "see the house
cleaning that Is going on at the present
time. .1 could enumerate a great many
ways in which-life insurance has been of
incalculable good to the entire country
and even to the entire : world. ..'
' ADVISES COMPLETE PUBLICITY. \
"1 have one or two suggestions to make
along the line on which this committee is
working that I think would do much to
clarify the situation."
Tarbell then submitted, after reading,
a list of suggestions, among which were:

LETTERS FROM
BURTON VANISH
Destroyed at the Bequest
of the Accused Senator,
According: to a Witness
ST. LOUIS, Nov. 22. â Thomas B. Har
lan was the first witness to-day in the
trial of United ' States 'Senator Burton,
who is charged with illegally accepting
fees while a. member i of, the' Senate. In
recalling his conversation with Senator
Burton when arranging for his ser
vices for the Rialto^Grain and Securi
ties Company, Harlan said: ."He said
(meaning. Senator Burton), 'Now, you
must remember, that I am- a United
States Senator. I am not going to do
anything inconsistent with my duty as
a United States Senator.' ;
"I assured' Senator Burton that I did
not want him under any circumstances
to do "anything inconsistent with his
position as United, States Senator and I
was just as positive in my statement as
he was in his declaration, so far as that
matter was concerned."
y Joseph P. Carr, who was'enxployed by
the. Rialto Company, during .the period
between November . -1,; 1902, and April,
1903, testified that, on instructions of
officers . of the" company, he drew and
cashed a check for ?500 and took the
currency to Vice President William D.
Mahaney of the Rialto Company, in
whose private office Senator Burton
was seated at the time." . :
\u25a0 Mahaney was,placed on the stand and
testified that on March. 26, ".190*3, he had
paid Senator; Burton $500. in currency.
Witness also testified that he told Sena
tor Burton; that as, there : were no fur
ther, matters pending before, the Post
office Department at. Washington and
that.', as -Congress; had adjourned and
for the additional.; reason that it was
necessary for the- company to reduce
expenses he saw no reason for the con
tinuance of ' the . employment of Bur
ton.: Mahaney further, stated that upon
the suggestion of Burton he destroyed
two letters that Burton had written,
Burton; having said to' him that should
any of his leters fall Into unfriendly
hands 4 Burton's motives might be mis
understood.'/" ; ; \u25a0'-'': : -. .
Mahaney ' identified' a telegram . rer
celved from Senator Burton, which was
read to the Jury, In reply to a dispatch
from ; Maha"he>v telllng.'Burton that Jt
had -been learned â¢ that two , special In

SPEED" WAR BETWEEN
TWO BIG RAILROADS
Kock Island and Santa Fe
Fighting for California
3lail Contract.
CHICAGO, Nov. 22.â Fighting to se
cure a big mall contract between Kan
sas City and Los Angeles, the Santa Fe
and Rock Island roads began a speed
war at the beginning: of this week. The
spoil of the war is a cdntract, worth
$250,000 a year, to carry the mail be
tween Kansas' City and Southern Cali
fornia, sit-iijf
The profits of -this contract will be
equal to almost the entire sum received,
because both roads have to carry mail
cars r on their .California limited trains
to accommodate the local mails, and
the through mail. will amount to but
ten or twelve tons a day. Already
both roads have reduced the running
time between Kansa City and the coast
from thirty" to forty-five minutes, and
it is probable that before long faster
time will be. made.
The new time card, which took effect
November 12. schedules the "Sant.i Fe's
California train for thirty minutes
shorter time between Kansa City and
Los Angeles than heretofore, and to
meet this the Rock Island's train Is be
ing run as a special at a forty-five
minute reduction in time. This reduc
tion will become permanent when the
Rock Island's new time card goes into
effect on November 26.

JEALOUS LOVER
SEEKS THE LIFE
OF HIS RIVAL
Shoots Five Times #nd
One BulJet Wounds
Robert Kelly.
Robert Kelly, an electrician living at
1124 Vallejo street, was shot and serious
ly \u25a0wounded by Ernest . Godina last night
about midnight. The wayiayer jumped
out from behind a dark gateway and
fired five shots at Kelly. One of them
struck him in the head and cut a fearful
hole through his face. Kelly was taken
to the Central Emergency Hospital and
treated by l>r. Pinkham. He will prob
ably recover, although the wound is a
dangerous one. Jealousy over a woman is
supposed to have betn the cause of the
bhootlng.
The affair happened directly in front of
the house of Dr. Frederick \V. L.ux. 1214
VaJleJo street, ar.d was witnessed by
several men who were returning to their
home* after an evening spent at the
borne of Kelly. Police-man Cornelius,
who was passing near-by, heard the shots
and rushed after the escaping criminal,
but was too far behind to effect a cap
ture.
Kelly had given un entertainment at
his home yesterday evening' ar.d about
12 o'clock he accompanied Miss Ger
trude Wall, who had been n truest at
the party, to her home on th<i corner
of Hycie and Pacific streets. H* was on
h!s way back aaiJ had jost reiehed the
gateway of Dr. Lux when a rria.ii leaped
suddenly from the shadows and lired
live shots at Kelly in quick succession.
One bullet caught Kelly ju*t behind the
ear. crashing: out tlirougii his facial
The instant that the wayiayer saw
his man fall to the ground he ran up
Vallejo street and turned down LÂ«cav
enworth. Four men. also guests of
the party, were within a few feet of
Kelly when he was shot, but they
seemed powerless to interfere or to
oaten the criminal, v. C. Dearbam,
2108 Larkin etreet. fell to 'the ground,
thinking that he was shot, and the
others, J. C. Murphy, 1009 Green street,
and Bernard M. Powers. 1721 Jones
street, were too startled to act quickly.
Policeman Cornelius was on bo&rd a
Hyde street car and saw the shooting-
Bravely he leaped from the car and
gave chase to the wayiayer. i On LÂ»eav
enworth 6treet he met a milkman, P.
J. Green, 2006 Howard street, who said
he had just seen a hatless man run
ning down Leaven worth in the direc
tion of the city. Cornelius followed, but
was unable to catch the assassin.
An ambulance was quickly summoned,
and the Injured man. taken to the Central
Emergency Hospital, where an immediate
operation was undertaken. Dr. Pinkham
gave it as his opinion that Kelly would
recover, but that' the wound waa a very
dangerous one. The friends of Kelly fol
lowed him to the bosoltal.
A reprehensible feature of the affair
was the manner in which Lieutenant Col
by of the City Hall police station con
ducted his Investigation of . the shooting.
He lent his every energy to hushing up
the details, although be had no right to
do so.
He was insulting to several spectators
who were present and who made petite
Inquiries. His actions indicated that he
was exerting himself to prevent the de
tection of the offender and to thwart
prosecution for the crime.
At a late hour this morning it Is
learned that the murderous assailant was
Ernest Godina. a youth of 29 years,
whose home is near Montgomery and
Vallejo streets. He was a guest at the
party. His version Is that he mistook
Kelly for ef footpad.
Dlex I'rom Hemorrhage of Brain.
The autopsy made by Dr. Bacigalupl
on the body of Joseph Becker,* who died
on a Sutter-street car on Tuesday night,
showed that death was caused by
hemorrhage of the brain. As a mat
ter of precaution the stomach and sec
tions of the liver, kidneys and brain
were sent to the city chemist for
analysis. Becker was a bartender at 12
California street and lix-ed with his
family at 102 McAllister street. When
he died on the car he was accompanied
by Miss Louise Graves, 2233 Sutler
street, who told , IJetectlve Matheson
that she met him on the ferry-boat
crossing from Oakland, and, as he com
plained of belnÂ£- tick, she out of kind
ness went with him to the car. Beck
er's wife told Captain Burnett that he
was subject to bleeding at the nose and
to attacks of apoplexy.

MEXICAN TOWN

Eped&! Dispatch to The Call.
TUCSON. Nov. 22.â The town of Potam,
on the Yaqui River In Sonora, has beer,
almost wiped out by floods which swept
down that stream, doing damage to the
rich farming lands of which Potam Is
the center. The first disaster came about
a week ago, when what has proved a long
season of rain first began: Swelled by
ttorms in the mountains many miles back
the river was converted into a torrent,
washing away fields which had just.been
planted and doing great damage to the
towns and settlements along its banks.
Thirty-five houses In Potam were carried
down the river by. this" flood. and 'a' great
many narrowly escaped death. -Had: not
the town been advised of the approach of
the great tidal wave by a telegraph mes
sage from Buena Vista a large number of
persons would certainly have perished.
At Guaymas and Hcrmcaillo $3000 was
raised for the benefit of the sufferers and
the Mexican Government wired $4000 for
their relief, when on Monday . last the
river, swollen by continuous, rains, again
broke away from its banks, carrying
away seventy-five more hous^fe at Potam.
At last accounts almost the entire town
was under water and 150 families, had
been rendered homeless. I ' Some of r them
succeeded In": earning their, effects to
neighboring higher ground, but the resi
dents of the place are suffering great pri
vations. ' . \u25a0 â¢',"
At Alamos and : other, towns . in the dis

by the flood. -

MAY AGREE UPON
RATE MEASURE
Indications That Republi

.WASHINGTON, Novy\ r 't2.â Railroad
rate-making was again considered by s the
Senate Committee on. Interstate , Com
merce to-day, . but . in \u25a0an informal', way,
as Â»no measures>as~ yet have been pre
sented \u25a0" to the- committee* upon which it
can' base Its \u25a0 action. Views were . ex
pressed by . several 5 members which in
dicated a .sharp division as far as the
situation was developed. There Is fur
ther ;" indication .that; a majority of the
committee^ will favor;, a measure giving
the ' Interstate ~ Commerce ' :' Commission
more power,' which means Sin some form
control over rates. \u0084 It seems; to 'be 'quite
well â¢; understood, that 'three/ Republicans
and enough Democrats : favor ' such legis
lation to : insure a rate-malclng bill being
reported. '.'-,.' . ,:.-,; .
Informal discussions among the Re
publican members of the committee show
that apprehension ris . felt that if a v bill
should be "reported by -Republicans and
Democrats against the : wish v of 1. a ma
jority of the Republican .'members, "it
would create a division in : the" party that
will:, work disaster,', in I the ) future. Those
Republicans r who favor ; rate-making leg
lslation assert that the way rto avoid ; a
rupture is to support ,a , conservative
measure, in' line ;\u25a0 with- ttievrecommenda
tions: of the President. Some of the'op

MANSFIELD'S
HIMSELF AGAIN
In "Beau Briiinmel" Gr^at
Artor Shines With Splen
dor That Made His â¢ Fame
So far as Shylocks*go there may be
othersthan Mansfield's, but there is only
"one Beau Brummel. This; Mr. Mansfleld
demonstrated once again last night at the
Grand Opera-house. Once again as Brum
mel lie asked the immortal: "Who is
your fat friend, Sherry?" and once again
one shuddered \ to think ol another . nnger
and. thumb In the Beau's snuffbox. Pos-
when all Is said, it is as Brummel
that Mansfleld will; be longest remem
bered. The. characterization U of the
things perfect, exquisitely individual,
uniquely exquisite. An Immense audience
testified to the local affection for the fig
ure, almost 'every seat holding an old or
new adherent of t..e Beau's'." ;
But.here.it is that Mansfleld reigns
supreme. One had the ghost of, a fear
that! the actor's . Indulgence in .Shy
locks, Don* Carlos and such had ' per
haps" imperiled the jeweled delicacy
of figure. , Undoubtedly the .comedy
suffered last night from the unsuitable
surroundings. The great spaces of the
Grand, Opera-house <r are not more tit
to frame a "Beau . Brummel" than . a
Mozart. Its miniature beauties .some
times" languished in the colossal set
tingâsomething as the Intimate fun
of the "Weber and Field folk got
lost down, there. But -as to the
Beau," Mansfleld was at bis best, ele
gance incarnate, .the perfect parasite.
Never has his, art seemed more .fin
ished, more exquisitely adroit, more
finely polished. From "scene to scene
one followed him with -renewed .de
light,'to find throughout the perfect
satisfaction. The lines ' were* delivered
again with the same" delicious fastidi
ousness, eminently In the manner of
the men that, asked to "take . tea."
gently, said,'- "one? 'takes' medicine,
'takes* snuff, but" 'drinlis' tea. dear ma
dame." A .comedy: of manners, par
excellence, _. .Mansfleld,- remains Its
prophet, and victorious- in a'"versatil
ity that from such a Shylock as he
gave the night before turned: thus .to* a
gem of such different * kind. ' To-night
he; does "King Richard lll,*' a cun
nlngr;and..vital contrast.
\u25a0..The supporting company : did , n%t dis
tinguish itself only in Mr. Andrews, who

Brave Teacher Saves Twenty-
Five Pupils From Third
'Story of Burning School
LAWRENCE, Mass., Nov. 22.â A1l but
one of the 400 girls attending the paro
chial school of St. Anne's parish, whoso
lives were endangered by fire in the
building- to-day, escaped wlthoij* In-
Jary. Twenty-five of them were caught
in nets by flremen as they were dropped
from a third-story winfiow by a teacher.
Rena.Drouin, 12 years old. was taken
to a hospital, suffering from the ef
fects of fright and inhaling smoke, but
it is thought that she will recover.
; All the pupils, except those on the
third floor, who escaped by means of
the net, marched out' of the building in
good order when the alarm was given.
Sister Mary, one of the teachers, and
her twenty-flye pupils, who were on the
"third .."floor, 'could not get down the
staira on account of the dense: smoke.
Tber*teacber, led the' children ,-^to thÂ©
windows, beneath which * the' flremeu
stretched a net. Under the sister's di
rection the girls climbed out; over: trib
sill and were assisted to drop and were
caught safely in the apparatus held by
th 2; firemen. After the last child had
been cared for Sister Mary herself
reached the street by means of a ladder.
â¢ The fire was caused by an overheated
furnace." The damage to the building
was slight.

That the Waterway Should
Be Excavated Quickly
6p*dÂ«l Dispatch to The Call.
CAXL BUREAU. POST BUILDING.
WASHIXGTON, Nov. 82.â The Isthmian
Canal Commission will take adverse
action on tne sea-level project which
eight of the thirteen members of the
advisory board of consulting engineers
have favored. The commission consists
of T. P. Shonts (chairman), former
Judge Masroon, Brigadier Generals
Ernst and Halna. Rear Admiral Endl
cott and B. M. Harrod. There Is one
vacancy, which may be filled by the ap
pointment of John F. Stevens, chief en
gineer of the car.aL . .
Stevens Is opposed to the sea level
idea, toward which his predecessor,
John F. Wallace, Inclined. Generals
Hams and Ernst favor the lock canal
plan, end Â«o does Harrod. Shonts and
Macoon, not being' engineers, undoubt
edly will fall into line with the Uesire
of the President and Secretary of War
that a lock canal be built.
The foreign members of the advisory
board feel that they have been subject
ed to unfair criticism. Suggestions
have been made in various quarters
that, of course, the foreigners were fa
vorable to a eea-level canal because
they were spending American money,
not their own. and the further distant
thÂ« day of the completion of the Pan
ama, waterway the better for European
commerce. Some of the foreign mem
bers '.have been asked to reply to this
and have declined.
In the Canal Commission office there
are fears that the interests opposed to
early completion of the canal "will seize
oil the sea-level project in the hope of
delaying the work.
' Commission omcials were asked to
day what were the Interests engaged in
the campaign of obstruction referred
to by President Roosevelt on his South
ern trip and by Secretary Taft and
Chairman Shonts in recent speeches.
Bishop, secretary of the commission,
said these influences had not disclosed
their precise identity, but there un
questionably was an effort to create
doubt as to the success of the attempt
to build a canal.

the news that he had successfully

that both were 4 well and bad plenty of
provisions when they reached the Prov
ince of Ungava on October 16.
In 1904 Wallace went with Leonidas*
Hubbard's ill-fated expedition. Hubbard,
whose purpose was to cross Labrador,
lost his life from starvation and Wal
lace Was found by the rescuing party
after he had fallen exhausted in the snow.
Although' the most perilous part of
Wallace's trip is completed, he still has
before him a winter of travel by snow
shoes before he reaches civilization, i He
and Easton. at the time when the let
ters were, written, 'were planning to start
westward through Ungava for Georges
River post, and ; thence to reach Fort
Chimo, which is one of the most north

America. Here the two. will wait until
the coast waterways are- frozen over.
Then they intend to. start southward, to

Missionary I. C. Wickware
Gives More Evidence of
Outrages- on the African
Additional stories of .barbaric atro
cities.committed on the 'defenseless na
tives of the Congo Free State by rep
resentatives of the Belgian Government
'were 'told; last. evening by the Rev. Iner
C. Wickware before the Christian and
Missionary.- Alliance convention at the
Free Baptist Church.
They were a startling continuation of
the revelations of revolting outrages
describedrthe previous evening and re
ported exclusively .in yesterday's Call.
. Mr. .Wickware surprised his audience
when "he frankly admitted that he
would be ; subjected to persecution on
his return 1 to, his post in Africa oh ac
count of what he had said, but he was
willing to face it all If the publication
of the., horrors he described would
bring;.about humane conditions. , - . â¢
Inibeginnihg his address he said:;.'
If publicity .-were then iV certainly
should " feel icrateful' to â¢ the San 'Francisco
Call for having given to the world so full a
report. of the atrocities by King Leopold's rep
'resentatlves aÂ« told by iae.' â¢Â« -\u25a0 v . '. '

extent. of the horrors of ' the treatment of the
natives. â¢: \u25a0 . " . . <
RECEIVES WARXIXG.
. -In. Winnipeg I told something about It and
I* received a letter of warning â¢ from, â¢ I pre
sume, I an i official there of the Belgian Gov
ernment, "who wrote among other things: "You
speak against my King and my Government.
.Yqu, aire spotted and you will hear from my
Government." * ' '
At tirst . I was. startled, and seeing; that it
was in the handwriting of a foreigner I had
instant, visions of the stiletto.- for thousands
have signed their, testimony with their blood.
'When 'I found â¢ the people here' knew but
little of, the. true state of things I determined
to unfold -the facts of the revolting: atrocities,
as I have known them. . .' w-^:;;.
If : there .should be any doubt, for the mis
sionaries' statements have been denied, let any
one who "- would like- more evidence write to
Mr. ( Moule. editor of the West African Mall,
and' the greatest champion in England of the
Africans In the Congo Free State. He has
gathered- up evidence at enormous cost. Mr.
Morrison and others can tell the facts. .
"'I could * show you pictures of the results of
the 'atrocities. Kven If we' people tell lies, Is
it possible for the camera to tell lies? . \u25a0

SHOCKING MUTILATION.
\u25a0 \u25a0 The \ soldiers were ordered, according to the
usual command, to cut - off their right hands,
but, . through -an error, began to cut off the
left i hands, j and remembering, - left off, leaving
the : left> hands partly mutilated and then cut
off the right hands.' At a convention of mis
sionaries at' Leopoldville they told of cruelties
that; are unspeakable. - -
It.' ls awful for me to speak .of these ter
rible 'conditions and It means something to
find one's. '.words, in a paper .which goes all
around- the country, for. they do spot mis
sionaries .when they go back and one now- is
being -persecuted for telling- of the ravages
and i the': whippings by the soldiers.
;>The-; t ; Rev. Henry Wilson, D. D.,
Protestant Episcopal clergyman of New
York, 5 for years field secretary of ' the
alliance, ; closed - the convention -with a
powerful plea v for> prayer -for; the mis
sionaries, and natives of ; Africa. : ;He
asked -how many present were willing
to take-up missionary, work in. the far
off f > fields .and seven young men and
women- responded. -.
\u25a0 Dr.- Wilson .addressed ai ' body of
young 1 'Japanese at the Japaneso Meth
odist: Episcopal Church before coming
to the convention, which" prompted him
to;speak of -the 45,000,000 they" repre
sented.'..^ He \u25a0 said: that no American
could fall to see that God had lifted the
despised nation" of twelve. years ago to

Detectives Ryan. and O'Dea. who ar
rested Sargent on Tuesday afternoon,
have now recovered "$lO,OOO worth of
Jewels and loot that: their prisoner had
taken from different stores In this city.
The detectives are of the, opinion that
Sargent, is an ; accomplished criminal,
and that he has. operated In many cit
ies of the, country, stealing much more
than has been attributed, to him. To
day several, charges' of grand larceny
will be placed -against, his name at the
Central police station. He has con
fessed, and will probably plead guilty.
Yesterday Sargent accompanied the de
tectives to his place of business In Point
Richmond and, according r to his promise,
revealed the hiding place of the balance
of the. stolen property. On Tuesday the
detectives recovered nearly $7000 worth of
diamonds that had been stolen from
'Adolplv Eisenberg at: 126 Kearny street.
Yesterday â¢ they "found - over $3000 worth
of jewelry, watchmaker's supplies, valu

the' juice of raw vegetables
and fruits. . It seems that* the
treatment began by the use
of potatoes^ onions, < beets,
turnips, cabbages and celery.
Later there were added sweet
potatoes, apples; pineapples,
carrots/and ; parsnips, and still
later rhubarb, summer squash,
tomatoes, sprin ach,' radishes,
string beans *and green peas
in the pod. 'v \ . ; \u25a0
It would feem to be absurd -
on its' face that, such treat-
ment could be used to effectu-
ally combat consumption^ yet
so. high'an authority as far.
Rijssell of the above-named
hospital, who seems to have
made the" discovery ar|d, d,e?
veloped the treatment, states
that eleven cases^ of well-de-
veloped pulmonary tubercu-
losis have- been absolutely
cured while fifty others are
under treatment and progress-
ing satisfactorily. â¢ /'.'*
It. is to be hoped that the
long looked for cure of this
dread disease has at last been
found in this treatment, but
\u25a0 the medical profession will,
doubtless, be sceptical, as they
are and should be on all new
treatments until more. -than
eleven cases have been c^ired
*by a combination of simple
vegetable juices that contain
little, if any, of the nourish-
ment required by the con-
sumptive. As Dr. Russell
says he has been the principle
advocate of nutrition as op-
posed to medicine in the
treatment, of tuberculosis, he
seems to contravert his own
theory in the. use of these
vegetable" juices that possess
such a small percentage of
nutrition. t . ' \u25a0
Hygiene and nutrition of
the best sort are absolute re-
quisites in the treatment of
V consumption. If the laws of
health are carefully observed
and the body, is sustained
with nutritious, wholesome,
.easily digested food, the rav-
ages of the disease, may .be
arrested, even when the lung
tissue is involved. There is
little question that the best
nutrition in the world in such
cases is the old and much
abused cod liver oil; riot in
its raw state but in the form
best adapted for its immediate
absorption into the body, as
found in Scott's Emulsion of
pure- Norwegian cod liver oil
which contains^ in, addition,
the valuable - h vpophosphites
Â£oflime and soda and glycer-
ine. We hesitate to say that
it will cure consumption, biit
after thirty years experience
with it, the medical profession
knows that/it/.wfll. arrest the
progress ofithejdiaease and in
its earlier sfaLges^nerally ef-
fect a permanent xiire. So
certain areVwe^of^this that
we challenge a /comparative
dinical test in any hospital or
sanitariurarwHeje there are pa-
tients^aiSicted^with this mal-
ady. -If ijk\wiH not cure more

free for a-.year. There, is^no
doubtl that Scott!s \ Etniilsiqji
is the most concentrated form
of nutrition in existence, and
if consumption. can be cured
at all it will do ; it.. : ;

PLAN TO PBODUCE ?

University. .
BERKELEY. Nov. 22.â The collapse
of the plans for the production at the
university of Stephen Phillips' great
drama. "Paola and Francesca." was
complete to-day, when it became
known that four of the principal, actors
selected for the, cast are to leave col
lege it the end of this term. This cir
cumstance will make it necessary to
beg-in the work of preparing for the
production all over next year, and
may operate to prevent altogether any
attempts at staging the play.
Gcorgo Baldwin was to have been
the Paola of the cast. He will not re
main in college, nor will Florence
Parker, who was to have been Lu
crexUJi; Tom Ambrose, the Marko of the
play, and J. W. Fisk. who had the part
of Corr'ado.
A meeting of those interested Jn the
matter -was held to-Bay and it was de
cided to f?ive up attempts to resusci
tate- the affair until, nest term. The
production was originally scheduled
for last Saturday afternoon in the
Greek Theater. It wae proposed to
make it the most pretentious of all
the university's dramatic spectacles.
Profes-sor yon N'eumayer selected and
â¢ oached the cast. He declared that the
time allowed for preparation was in
sufficient and clashed with Professor
Armcs, head of the University Dra

Gang 1 Like "Jim Crows' 1
Assault Murphy
Brothers.
Fiends Have Lookouts,
Fleeing if Police
OAKLAND, Nov. 22.â A reign of terror
has .been Inaugurated in the western-por
tion of the city by a gang of young thugs,
similar to the East Oakland organization
known as the "Jim Crow" gang, three
members of which are .charged with the
murder of Thomas W. Cook last July.
So bold have the members of the gang
become that attacks on citizens and at
tempted holdups are of nightly occur
rence in West Oakland, and many of the
male residents of that portion of the city
who have never before found it necessary
to carry arms have provided themselves
with weapons, and declare that they will
use them if attacked by any of the crowd,
whose actions have mafic it unsafe to be
alone on the street after dark.
The latest outrage perpetrated by the
gang was an attack by a dozen of the
crowd on George H. Murphy, an employe
of the Southern Pacific Company, and
his brother, Edward Murphy, in which
the former was so brutally beaten and
kicked on the head that he may lose the
sight of his right eye. Edward Murphy,
while trying to rescue his brother from
his assailants, was struck on the head by
a stone thrown by a member of the gang
and was rendered unconscious, having a
deep gash cut in the back of his head.
Had it not been that the blow was a
glancing one the young man would have
been killed.
LOOKOUTS WAIIX GANG.
The headquarters of the gang is , in an
old warehouse near the corner of Eighth
and Pine streets and a system of lookouts
has been established. This makes it im
possible for the policeman on the beat to
approach unseen, and as soon as he
makes -his -appearance the members of
the crowd scatter, to reassemble as soon
as he has left the scene. The attack on
the Murphy brothers was made at the
corner of Seventh and Pine streets, as the
two men were returning to the home of
George Murphy at 939 Pine street. \ A
member of the gang walked up to the two
and made an insulting remark to George
Murphy, following it instantly with a
blow which staggered Murphy, and be
fore he could regain his feet he was set
upon by the others. Neither of the broth
ers knows of any reason for the attack,
except that they have refused to associate
with the crowd of thugs, and have on
several occasions declined to purchase
liquor for them.
Other attacks of a similar nature have
been reported to the police, one- of them
being that on J. B. Prentisg and Albert
Gibson, both railroad \u25a0 men, as they were
returning from worn. Both were badly
beaten and neither knows the reason of
the attack, as they say they have never
had any trouble with the members of the
gang, but have simply refused to have
anything to do with them. Peter Beck,
who says he is a machinist, but v.iio Is
given a hard name by residents of West
Oakland, has been identified as one of the
assailants of Gibson and Prentiss, and is
now in jail awaiting trial for his share in
the assault.
MAKE THREATS OF .MURDER.
Frank M. Halloran, a bollermaker, re
siding at 950 Campbell street^ is another
who has suffered at the hands of the
gang, being attacked because he refused
to give them money to buy liquor. He
was attacked and brutally beaten while
on his way home from' work, and yester
day a message was sent to him. telling
him that lf.be dared to make complaint
to the police he would be "done up for
keeps." \u25a0 \u25a0- . |
Reports of fresh outrages by members
of the gans: come to the police almost
every day, but owing to the fact that it, is
almost Impossible for the victims to: rec
ognize their assailants in tbe darkness,
the authorities have been able to > make
but little progress.,
It is believed by the officers who \u25a0 have
been investigating the record of Joseph
A. Wllley. -who was killed. while resisting
arrest at San Pablo, that he was a mem
ber of the same band, and that the rea
son, of hi* desperate battle with the offi
cers waa that he feared arrest on account
of complicity in outrages on citizens . of
West Oakland. .V
TEM.S STORY OF ATTACK.
When seen at his home this afternoon
George Murphy, whose head and face are
swathed in '\u25a0-* bandages 'covering -A the
wounds Inflicted by the fists and shoes*of
his assailants, gave the following account
of the encounter: \u25a0 ' '\u25a0
My brother and I were returning home, af
ter havinÂ«r\sone to the car with Frank Hal
loran, ,wlien. a' man came up and called me a
vile name, r Before I \u25a0 could-, defend , myself he
struck-' me ' a heavy blow, si&Kgerlng . me, . and
ttaen*th6 whole crowd jumped . on Ed and tny
tÂ«lf. . I. thought thÂ«y wouta?kill me before I
coma get awÂ«y. and when~Kd tried to help ire
one pi them knocked him senseless with a
rock. I am sore all over, and I am afrala
thy right eye Is badly hurt. I don't think I
could identify any of the crowd, .because the
attack was made about 6;30, after It was
dark, and I could not see - who they were. . I
know, however, that the man who calls him
ertf the leader- of the crowd is DennU Nolan,
.but 1 do not. know, where he lives.' .

MUSIC COURSE
AT STANFORD
Registrar of the University
Announces ; â¢ a Class AVil 1
& Be Formed Xext Semester
MAY BE PERMANENT ONE
Dr. B. C;-Blodgett. Organist
: of the" â¢ Memorial Chapel.
Will "Act as Instructor
Special Dlsrpatch to The Call.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Nov. 22.â
The registrar of the Stanford University
has announced that beginning with next
semester there will be a course In music
by Dr. B. C. Blodgett, organist of the
memorial chapel. It is undecided as yet
whether the institution will be perma
nent.
The subject is to be divided into two
main topics and the courses will be either
combined or separate as the -registrar
may decide. One branch is to be the
interpretation of famous composers like
Bach, Mozart, Schubert, Chopin and
Wagner. This will be assisted by consid
erable study of the piano. The other
branch la to be on the history of music
and will be devoted exclusively to lec
ture work and collateral reading.
Should the two divisions be combined
the entire subject will consist of three
university hours. If they are taken sep
arately two will be given to the in
terpretation and one to the reading.
The Institution of the course is favored
by many and will undoubtedly furnish one
of crowded classes. There is at present
a similar course at the State University.
Dr. Blodgett is an excellent instructor
as his experience has been extensive. For
the last two years he has been the or
ganist of the Stanford Memorial Chapel
and director of the student choir of 100
voices. Before â coming to Stanford, he
held a similar position at Smith's College
of Massachusetts for twenty-five years.

Before a Court - Martial
LIQUOH IS THE CAUSE
Charged With Conduct Unbe
coming His Position While
in the General Hospital
Captain Robert \V. Rose of the Twenty
first Infantry appeared before a court
martial at the Presidio yesterday morning
to answer to a charge of conduct unbe
coming an officer and a gentleman. The
trial was held behind dosed doors and
the greatest secrecy maintained among
the officers who were detailed to hear the
case. Nevertheless, the facts leaked out
that on October 17 Captain Rose was dis
charged from the General Hospital at the
Presidio under very peculiar circum
stances and a few days later charges
were filed against him with the depart
ment commander.
The Twenty-first Infantry left this city
fcr Manila on a transport on February 1
last. After a few months' service in the
Philippines. Captain Rose, who accom
panied his regiment, was taken sick and
ehortly afterward received orders from
the War Department to proceed to San
Francisco and report at the General Hos
pital for observation and treatment. He
arrived m this city on the transport
Sheridan and reported at the hospital
October 13, where he remained only four
days, when he was discharged.
The officers at the hospital disclaim all
knowledge of the affair, although they
admit that it is rather unusual to dis
charge a patient in four days, who has
been sent here from the Philippines for
treatment. It was hinted, however; that
Rose was addicted to the free use of in
toxicants and while under the influence
of liquor, which he obtained in some un
known way, he had created a disturbance
in the hospital which resulted in his dis
charge from the p!ace and the filing of
charges against him.
The result of the trial will probably be
made known in a few days in the report
to the War Department. The officers
who were appointed to hear the case are:

THE HUB'S
AXXEX CO3IPLETED
Public Inspection of Hand
some Shop To-Xight and
To-Morrow Xight.
Invitations have been freely Issued by
Messrs. Keilus and Alexander, proprie
tors of 'The Hub." for the inspection of
the new annex to their store that has
just been completed. It is said, and
with an excellent. -show of reason, that
the new "Hub" Is the most modern and
best appointed exclusive men's clothes
shop In the United States. After a
careful inspection of the premises it
would be hard to conceive a more cle
g-ant, modern or better equipped clothes
shop. Occupying: both stores at either
end of the Thurlow block, they have
been connected by a glass lens tunnel
thirty feet wide and thirty-five feet
long. The floor and celling- are both
made of glass that permits a flood of
natural light to penetrate every corner
of this large area and display the mer
chandise to the best possible advantage.
On one side of the tunnel is a series of
marble dressingr-rooms, each equipped
with running water, while on the oppo
site side extends an equal series of lava
tories. The workshop is located in the
gallery that extends from Sutter street
the entire length of the Thurlow block,
providing ample and comfortable quar
ters for a large force of workmen.
A novel feature of the Hub Is the
paneling of the ceilings, on which has
been produced, by the clever manipula
tion of aluminum leaf and lacquer, an
effect of frosted mirrors. Suspended
from each panel are two gilded hubs
that are emblematic of the store. The
decorative effects are very pleasing, be
ing consistently carried out in white
enamel and gold.
The growing business of the Hub has
necessitated this expansion of quarters,
and hereafter customers will be afford
ed every comfort and convenience In
pursuit of their shopping. Light, airy
and not crowded with everything upon
the ground floor, the new shop offers
unusual facilities to "dressers." Men's
suits and trousers will be carried In the
Eutter-street department and overcoats,
fall dress goods and Albert frocks in
the Annex.
Mother Sue* Children.
The Mission-street Cracker and Bis

that she Is owner of a half-interest In

been drlren from the premises by the
defendants, physical force being used.

WITH HUGGING
Army Officer Seizes Wrong
Woman and Husband Gives
Him Into Police Custody
First Lieutenant R. W. Adams, U. S.
A., is charged with a serious offense by
Mrs. Mary Bingham and her husband of
ISS4 O'Farrell street.
The "officer and gentleman" is accused
of accosting the woman in a familiar
manner and attempting to embrace her
and take liberties with her while she
was standing with her husband at . the
corner of O'Farrell and Market streets
Tuesday night.
The accused officer was arrested and
booked at the City Prison Tuesday night.
He was released on furnishing $5 bail, j
When the case was called in Judge ,
Conlan's court by Judge Cabanlss, act
ing pro tern, the lieutenant did not ap
pear.
Mrs. Bingham and her Indignant hus
band were there, however, and de- \u25a0
manded that Lieutenant Adams be prose- j
cuted. Judge Cabaniss issued a bench !
warrant for the absent army officer and j
he was . rearrested. Adams was not in
any condition to give his version of the
incident yesterday. He was released im
mediately after the second arrest on
producing bail for $100.
Adams Is passing through here on his
way to the Philippines. He Is attached
to the Ninth Infantry and Is on his way
to join his regiment in the Islands.
Though Mrs. Bingham is bent on; hav
ing Adams prosecuted, she is inclined to
be reticent about the disagreeable affair.
She declared that she was waiting for a
car with her husband when Adams
reeled by. â¢
According to the husband and wife,
Adams spoke to Mrs. Bingham and at
tempted to embrace her. The indignant
husband seized the army officer and
held him until the arrival of Policeman
Sheehan.
Adams enlisted during the Spanish-
American war- and won his commission
from the ranks. He was given his first
commission by President Roosevelt.

trunk on Tuesday and was astounded
that his savings of .years had disap
peared. Ott had left the house that
morning while Johnson was asleep, and
as he. failed to return during the aft
ernoon Johnson's suspicions were
aroused and he notified the police.

certained that. Ott .had -purchased . a
ticket at the Santa . Fe ofllce for Chi
cago on Tuesday morning and. had ap

and Chief Dinan at once Â«. wired to^all
towns and cities on that route to ar
rest Ott. Johnson told , Captain" Bur

FRAUD AVERRED
BY M'KINNON
Eemoval of \ Administratrix
Demanded on Ground That
She Has Deceived Court
ATTOENEYS ACCUSED
Lent & _\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 Humphrey- JCKarged;
With Making Iffls^eturn
of Sales of
Charging that she has \u25a0misappropriated
moneys placed in her ' keeping, : and that,
in conjunction with.* Lent; :& Humphrey,
her attorneys, she has -made fraudulent
returns of sales to: the Superior r Court,
John Louis McKlnnonv yesterday; peti
tioned for the -removal : of g Leonjde : M. ?
Mclvinnon as administratrix; of .the 'es
tate, of the late John ;J.'!McKinnon, who
died in 1896, leaving real ? and personal
property j valued at $50,000. > It Vls further
charged that since ShY was. appointed 'to
office Mrs. McKlnnon has wholly neg
lected her duties, refusing to furnish ac
countings and failing to -file reappraise
ments, after she had made various sales
of estate property. . ' ' v
Mrs. McKinnon's attorneys are said to
even now hold in their possession arti
cles of- jewelry which the return of sales
show to have been long since disposed of
at sums, the petitioner \ claims, \u25a0 much
lower than their real value.
John J. McKinnon died . Intestate, "i He
left real estate located eon - Post and
Geary streets and lots in Tulare County.
In addition were corporation stocks .val
ued at 115,000, diamonds and | jewelry. said
to be worth $2000. '-and $6500 in cash. Le
onide McKinnon was appointed adminis
tratrix in 1001. Some months afterward
she filed a return of sale in the Supe
rior Court, signed by herself and attor
neys, which, says the petitioner, pur
ported to give notice of -the sale of 1000
shares of stock in the Cypress Lawn'lm
provement Company to "A. \u25a0 C. Hampton
for $4500. : . ... .... .
ALLEGES MISREPRESENTATION. ""
This was a misrepresentation,- says -thie
petitioner, the fact being that the stock,
was sold to one George D. Perry, a clerk
in the. offices of Humphrey & Lent, who
acted asa-dummy. Hampton, it is as-,
serted, never knew, there i was such a
sale as reported- in j the return made * in'
the court. Later it is charged that 900 of'
the shares were sold at the rate of $5 a
share.) ''\u25a0 \u25a0 â¢ .<i
At another alleged pretended sale the
petitioner. _ claims, that George H.;
Lent of the firm" ' of Hooker" "&
Lent acted as auctioneer, and made
a false affidavit, , stating; that _ t he
had sold a gold watch' and chain ,to
Hampton for $20: This Jewelry, it is ' al-'
leged, like the . stock, was later ; sold at
private sale to one D. A. McDonald, who
paid $100 for it. Another charge Is that
Mrs. McKinnon obtained an order of the
court allowing $100 a month as a family
support for the decedent's widow, Sarah
McKinnon, the payments to date from
March 11.' 1597. .
This money, says the petitioner, never
went to the widow. 1 Instead, It is claimed,
a large portion of It was appropriated to
the administratrix's own use.
HU3IPHREY MAKES ANSWER.
Regarding the charges, William P.
Humphrey , of, Lent & Humphrey said:
These false and groundless charges are made
without even the remotest expectation of sus
taining them. There are six heirs of John J.
McKinnon, deceased; the .widow. Sarah Mc
1 Klnnon, her three unmarried daughters, two
sons and the widow and minor Â«hUd .of a" de
ceased- son. When' Mlsa Leonlde McKinnon
was ; appointed administratrix In 1901. -we were
employed as her attorneys. At that time tha
estate was practically insolvent, as it was in
1SV)O, when Mr. McKinnon died. The widow's
allowance had been stopped. . "I'^'S JvÂ»
The estate Is now valued- at about $100,000
and all the creditors are paid. .- Over J. Louis
McKlnnon's objection in ., November, 1903, his
mother was granted a family allowance of $100
per montk. Over his objection the accounts
of his sister Leonide M. MeKlnnon have been
settled and amroved by the court All the
matters mentioned In this petition for her re
moval were then passed on and approved. He
appealed from both decisions and his appeals
to the Supreme Court were dismissed. He rep
resents but one-twelfth Interest In the estate,
and Is opposing his mother, three sisters and
brother, all of whom approve all that has been
done.
His fancied ' grievances led him to employ
some of the best and most upright attorneys at
this bar. To date .he has had seventeen at
torneys. . The court records , show these facts.
No attorney would undertake to Initiate pro
ceedings such as "these until he found Nagle
& Nagle late of the estate of Elizabeth Boyne,
deceased*. Naffle & Najtle were removed as
representatives of that estate by Judge Coffey
for practices condemned by him. :Thls removal
was ~ based on a petition filed by us on behalf
of our clients, and â¢ Nagle & Nagle seek | vindi
cation by this malicious attack. '-. The stock and
Jewelry mentioned In the petition were sold at
public auction I and purchased by an agent . of
Mrs. . McKinnon, the petitioner's mother, as
he knew. She became the owner of this stock
and her husband's jewelry. ': : :v.: v .
George H. Lent had nothing to do with it.:
He simply acted as auctioneer. The sale took
plaoe -in April. 1902, almost four years \ ago, .
and although seventeen attorneys investigated
the matter.no one discovered any ground for
such a. petition until Nagle & Nagle came Into
the case. .' ;. \u25a0j' ' f '

That Oscar; EUinghouse

Story She Would Have Told
Her Other Children Never
/Finished, Lawyer Declares
The trial of the contest" of the will
of the late Mrs. Bertha Elllrighouse, in
stituted by. Mrs.. Emma G. ' Stone and
Edward, Ellinghbuse, children! of the
deceased, has â¢ been t concluded. The
charges of the. contestants \ that the
testatrix was unduly; Influenced while,
weak- in: mind rand: body *. have been
heard. and the defense of Oscar Elling
house.^brother'of the contestants and
"chief beneficiary under the "will, has
been exploited. 1 Naught 'now remains
but the decision of Probate Judge Cof
fey, before whom ; the trial was held.
Samuel M. Shortridge, counsel for the
contestants, closed the argument yes
terday morning and: in so doing dwelt
upon points /heretofore untouched by
the lawyers in their analysis of the evi
dence. . In part Mr. Shortridge said
One! point. I wish ti> : make clear to your
Honor la that the frail form of this old woman,
now at rest in -the grave, often trembled in
fear of her son. , Oscar; wny we can only sur
mise through facts disclosed during the trial
now drawing to a conclusion. Frequently, -af
ter first warning her daughter and Edward
not to disclose to Oscar what ' she was about
to tell them, she would begin to recite a story.
This story, however, whatever It may have
been, was never finished; -her courage would
fall her and she would cease to talk.
This record has further disclosed the fact
that Oscar was always hostile to his brother,
Edward; hostile to the Brother that laboieJ
and to the \u25a0 good sister j that worked that he
might have an education. Then when he grew
to manhood's estate ingratitude was his most'
predominant characteristic, but hardly less de
veloped was his avarlca and Ingratitude.
While testifying on the stand In this case he
was compelled to admit that he gave false
testimony as to his , knowledge, prior to the
death of his mother, of the provisions of his
will, and on this point was contradicted by his
own wife. Your Honor,- 1 -will 6ay to you that
when in a man you find cupidity, . avarice and
ingratitude;.- when I you' find , an" unnatural son
as we ; have found In Oscar E/Ulngnouee, you
will be | disappointed If In such a person you
look for veracity. As he nas admitted that he
gave false testimony on one point, I shall ask
that, he be distrusted in all of his testimony,
for to this day -we have recognized the wis
dom of the ' Latins aa expressed In their max
im : .."Falsus In uno, falsus In omnlbua."
â¢ Mr/ Shortridge then spoke of the
limitation that confronted the court
which prevented It from decreeing that
not ? only justice, but what would be
only right In thet case at bar, retribu
r've* Justice should be provided for. He
said:- : * 7L}l -
There should ba a law. that. would permit of
the punishment of a person 'who contrives by
scheme and 'device to steal an Inheritance that
by, right belongs to another; this would only
bÂ» retributive justice. - Should this court find
that we are entitled to Judgment In our favor,
all that the court can do Is to give these con
testants one-third each of the . estate and
award the proponent of. this will, Oscar Ell ing
house, the other third.
This should not be; the court should have
the right to punish this unnatural son for his
unlawful acts, take from him the right of In
heritance and divide that which would have
been his had It come to him honestly be
tween those he has eought to defraud. .

sault With Intent to Bob
SAYS HE .IS INNOCENT
Accused of Striking H. F.W.
Spreen, Hotel Proprietor,
and Demanding His Money
"Don't -shoot me: I. didn't know you
were an. officer,", shouted. J. B. Duff as
he* stopped suddenly in his night early
yesterday - morning : on Pine street and
threw up his hands. C. M. Donovan, one
of Morse's 1 patrolmen,* had fired a shot
in the air to intimidate him. Donovan
slipped the handcuffs over Duff's wrists
and turned him over to Policemen Duffy
and j Hems, who took him to the City
Prison and booked him on a charge of
assault with Intent to. commit robbery.
.H. F. WV Spreen, proprietor of a hotel
at 606 Geary street, says that while he
was walking along Stockton street, be
tween Pine and Bush, on his way home
shortly before 1 o'clock. Duff Jumped out
of a dark doorway ami struck him two
violent blows on the face with his fists,
at the same time making a demand for
money. Spreen grappled with him. he
says, and 'while they were struggling on
the sidewalk, Donovan observed them
and ran toward them.
As soon as Duff saw Donovan, he broke
away and ran along Stockton 6treet to
ward Pine, followed by Donovan. Duff
turned the corner of Pine and was half
way down the block when Donovan fired
a shot in thÂ© air. Duff stopped suddenly
and, throwing his hands up, shouted to
Donovan not to shoot. him. >
At the City Prison yesterday Duff, who
is 19 years of age, said he had been em
ployed for a few days as a waiter in a
restaurant at 12 Turk Btreet. He came
from Los Angeles two weeks ago! He
denied having attempted to rob Spreen.
He said he met Spreen on the street and
Spreen wanted him to go with him. While
they were walking along. Spreen made a
remark that Duff said he did not like,
and when Spreen repeated It, Duff struck
him on the face. He thought that Dono
van, who was In plain clothes, might be a
friend, of Spreen and that was why, he
ran away. He said he had never been
in any trouble before.
Fall* to Recover . -toek Certificate.
Justice of the Peace Daniels yester
day gave Judgment against W. H. Bar
ton, who sued Benjamin Boas for
$162 60, the value. of a stock certificate
of fifty shares issued -by the Central
Light and Power Company. In his tes
timony ' Barton stated that he had a
certificate of stock numbered 150,

i nder certificate No. 531. Boas went
on the witness stand and positively
denied that he had ever received the

JAPANNING KOREA.
KORiiA was the bone of contention between Japan and Russia.
In Russian bands Korea commanded and subordinated Japan.
The Hermit Kingdom was under the suzerainty of China fora
long time, and paid annual tribute at Peking 1 . "Otherwise it. was
independent Hi its administration, i As a \ result of : the \u25a0Chinb-Jap
ane'se war Korea cast off the suzerainty of China and immediately
became the -victim of Russian intrigue. :
The Russian aggression began in the shape of industrial con
cessions. In getting these coercion was used. When the late war
began Japan wisely lost no time in getting into Korea. It was
necessary to her purposes. Her armies were landed on Korean soil
to inarch into Manchuria. The resources of the country, were drawifc
upon to feed the army, and when the war ended the whole kingdom
was in-thc hands of Japan. , The peace treat)- admitted and confirmed
this Japanese supremacy, and now the overturning has been coin-.
pleled by the mission of Marquis Ito: The Emperor of Korea stood
out protesting, in fear of the spirits of his ancestors, but the wily
Ito had taken the precaution to secure his assent to leaving the
cjucstfoVfTor settlement to his Ministers, of whom he had seven. A
majority of these considered a good stun in hand of more impor
tance than ancestors in the ground, and with them the negotiation
was concluded;
The Emperor retired into his sanctum and tried to placate the
spirits of his ancestors by ordering his Ministers assassinated. But
i he. presence in Seoul of 30,000 troops of the ever-victorious army of'
]apan prevents the execution of this spirit placating decree.
â¢yapan follows the policy of Great Britain in India, by appoint
ing a Japanese administrator of Korea, to co-operate with the Em
peror in ruling. It is needless to say that the Emperor's part in
running the country will noj; keep him awake nights. ,In the usual
course of events in. such cases he will probably be the last of his
line* and the annexation of Korea to Japan, will be complete, and
the benevolent assimilation of the country will follow, with the
Mikado as its s,ole ruler. This will be satisfactory to the spirits, of
Ihe Mikado's ancestors, who will have a horse upon -the -ancestors
of Yi-Hiung, his Majesty of Korea.
The country covers 80.000 square miles, a little more than half
the area of California, and is credited with a population of 10,000,000.
The .climate is favorable, for the country lies between 34 and 42
north latitude, which implies the physical conditions 'which arc
found on this coast between Tulare, California, and the south Hire of
Oregon. The crops include rice, rye, wheat, millet, tobacco, cotton,
hemp and ginseng. The potato was introduced, but its cultivation
was forbidden by the Government, probably for fear of' offending
the spirits of ancestors. All the fruits of Central Europe are pro
duced, but of inferior quality. The domestic animals are small
horses, cattle, swine and dogs. The dogs are used for food, and
their skins are exported in considerable quantity. Only, the Em
peror raises sheep and goats, and lie uses them only in religious
ceremonies. The country is well watered and is known to be rich in
gold, silver, copper, iron and coal. The Government has prohib
ited mining, so that these mineral resources fall to Japan as a prize
that she will not be slow to take and use. The spirits of Koreans
long gathered to their forefathers were supposed to abhor ; , mining,
but the Japanese will not respect the objections of those disembodied
knockers, and will go on and develop the country.
The religion of the country needs straightening out as much as
its government and industries. It is a confusing mixture of Bud
dhism and Confucianism, boiled down in a syrup of singular super
stitions. The common people are convinced"" that the devil runs
things terrestrial and that he can be bought off. So the devil has a
profitable 'graft and does a big business. One feature in the reli
gious life of the people is of singular interest, since it is the survival
of a cult that was general among the ancient peoples of Eastern Eu
rope and was cherished by the Greeks and Romans. This is the
preservation of the ancestral fires, on the domestic altar. This
sacred fire is maintained at all cost, as the Vestal Virgins in Rome,
maintained it in the temples. That such a religious custom should
be found over the vast stretch from Italy to the Yellow' Sea is an
interesting evidence of the agreement of primitive man upon what
was held by them all as an essential in an early form of the 're
ligious idea. Among the finer characteristics of the people is the
strong affection of parents for their children and the filial respect of
children for their parents. This is the excellent contribution of Con
fucianism to their manners and customs.
As a part of Japan Korea is destined to be better known to the
world. The kingdom tried to get itself on a better basis some years
ago and employed the late General MacE. Dye and another Ameri
can officer to reorganize its army. It is of interest to Californians
that the late Clarence Greathouse, formerly a San Francisco jour
nalist and lawyer, was for years the adviser of the Korean Emperor.
TO ATTRACT TOURISTS WESTWARD.
SEE Europe if you will, but see America first,; is the appeal to
patriotism and common sense made by the Commercial Club
of Salt Lake City in their endeavor to obtain the western part
of our country a juster share of the many millions of dollars Amer
ican tourists spend annually in sightseeing,;, health- hunting and
amusement. It is estimated that during the season of 1904-05
American sightseers. spent the vast sum of $150,000,000 in foreign
countries. The Commercial Club has set itself to the task of.ob
taining a large share of this tourist travel by making better known
the advantages of the United States west of. the Mississippi to
the great number of Eastern people who rush off to see the well
advertised sights of Europe before they have examined and appre
ciated the glories of their own country. V? ?-Ji
â¢.The officers of the club are perfecting arrangements -for, a "con
ference of the Governors of the States and Territories affected, and
of representatives of the chief commercial bodies of the West and
of the railroads interested. The Commercial Club will then pass
from generals to particulars and present a "detailed, definite aniti
comprehensive plan of procedure." The date set for the- conference
is January 18, 1906. . .
It is, of course, absurd' to raise objections to Americans tour
ing Europe for pleasure and cultivation when they have; the means
to do so. The old countries have an immense ad vantage in. the way
of artistic, historic and religious interests, scientific progress and
music; but there are a great many who- travel just for amusement,
to. behold scenic grandeurs, to find health and to be on the watch
for investments. pTb these a Western trip -would be just as satis
factory'or more so. . â¢- â¢ - \u25a0 â¢ _-.v> . . v
Particularly to people who for the first time find themselves pos
sessed of "the leisure -and the .means of travel the attractions of
their own country should make the strongest appeal. They. should
know their own country, thoroughly and be prepared to -tell Euro
peans about its glories before they go abroad .to â¢learn -Europe.
Another class that should be persuaded are those who ;have the
leisure to make repeated trips. Those who have seen Europe should
consider the Rocky Mountains, the Columbia River, the \u2666 magnifi
cence of _ California, in planning their future" trips; .What they 'spend
in the West is much more likely to help build up the general-pros
perity, so as to add to their fortunes indirectly, than would expendi
tures on foreign trips. Particular attention should be paid to that
advantage there is in leisurely ' travel and- observationâ the watch
out for good, new and unmonopolized opportunities for investment.
Many an expensive plcasuretrip might thus -be f turned into a profit
able adventure, and the cost of the enjoyment be finally overcome
by a big sum on the profit side of the ledger:'
It. seems that Admiral Evans can crochet some too, or he wouldn't be
able to keep up with Prince Louis of BattenbVrg.â Detroit Free Press. .'

HIS WEDDING CARD.
SI. "William Busnach. a well known
Paris author, who is -73 years of age, has
just married /a young actress, Mile.
Yrven, aged 23, of the Folics Dramatlques
Theatre, says the London Mail, and he
has advised his friends of the marriage
by sending out the following postcard:
\u25a0*M. William Busnach. has the honor
io jntorm you of his marriage with Mile.
Miircelle Yrven. P. S.â Please send neither
flowers nor wreaths." . . .. .
O:i being interviewed concerning his
marriage, the author said: "In spite ; of
the fifty years' difference. between us we
ere both of us pleased at being marrfed.
I am an old. man who has fallen violently
In love with a young woman whom I saw
one. day by chance. Of, course, there
will be a lot of .satire at my expense, but
what does it matter? .
*'I am the first to make fun of myself.
I do not ask my wife for a love passion,
which, of course, I could not expect from
her, but merely for a good, honest affec
tion, such as a very young woman might
be expected to feel for a man old enough
to be her grandfather.
"My wife thinks me very funny," by no
means a bore, and ahe is pleased, to bear
a well known name, Mine. Busnach. That
is why we have married. . I am shortly
about to produce a new play, *Mme.

James .Branch Cabell, the 'author, has

has adopted a form of reply which he
declares to be efficacious. "I find I do
my best^work," so runs Mr. Cabell's
statement^ "lying at full length in a
marble tank filled with gold fish, with
the water at a temperature of 80 to less
en the hoat of inspiration." As a mat
ter of fact, Mr. Cabell admits that he
does not know his method of compo
sition further than that he rarely aver
ages a thousand words at a sitting and
that he works only at night.

GROWING OLD TOGETHER
A Few Lessons for Married I People Shown in Several
Touching' Life Stories.
DOROTHY FENIMORE
I LIKE to escape whenever I can from
" the hubbub of divorce court news and
'â¢'the % Bc'eries. of .'marital infelicity -with
which the horizon presented by' the; dally
press is usually disfigured, to let my'mind
dwell in the cheerful atmosphere of homes
where married life- is a sacrament and
not a travesty of sacred things. ; : '
Otherwise I could not at weddings listen
with any kind of equanimity to that sol
emn marrriage vow, ; "For better, for
worse; for richer, "for poorer, 'â¢ In sickness
and in health, so. long as we both shall
live." ' " . ." ' V /.
I erijoy thinking about the gentle acts
of marital devotion wherewith the pages
of personal historyâ o! the humble as well
as ':Â£ the stfeatâ are fall. It pleases me
whenever I see one ot a couple nmkJns
cacru'ees forw thi othtr. And to my eyes
jthere is nota. companionship in the world
irr.ore attractive to, look upon than thr.t Â«\u25a0>!
,a married pair who.- have grown old., to-
Igether.
Because this is my. taste and pleasure
I am. forever stumbling upon little Inci
dents of wedded romance which 1 , do . me
'good, and a few of them I shall relate
in tha hope that some of my readers may
'happen to have a predilection like my
!own. '\u25a0: ~
â¢ I wonder how many of you noticed that
'anecdote of the late; Prince Bismarck's
[wife, recounted at the time of the no
ibleman'3 death, which shows that her
llove was not born a twin* of jealousy.
\u25a0When, some time after her marriage, she
f found hidden away in the garret in an
old trunk of her husband's a picture of
the lovely Princess' Carolath, with whom
herhad- eloped a number of years before,
she '.'had -'-the picture . handsomely framed
and. gave it place of honor in her bou
doir." She loved her husband enough so
that all that he loved was precious to
tier. ' "'; . :. â¢- . ; ' ' .
; There was another story in the papers
this past year which caught my fancy.
It â¢ concerned one Samuel Savel, a mer
chant of the Newark ghetto, who on his
deathbed" underwent the fatiguing and
unusual ordeal of a divorce before, three
rabbis in order that his beloved wife need
not wed his brother when fhe became a
widow, in accordance with an old Mosaic
law, still observed by the orthodox Jews,
On the . ocean )ilner v which brought me
back from Europe last summer I had an
experience which moved me deeply, for
it gave me a glimpse into the tragedy
of a loving human heart and at the same
time offered roe a view through the gold
en portals of that infinite goodness -Which
Is atthe soul, of all unselfish living.
.One evening I was sitting on the wet
and windswept deck with an, elderly lady,
an actress, whose life had been uncom
monly full of domestic trouble. Her hus
band had wronged her to a degree that
most women would have considered un
forgivable, and finally for some years -be
fore his death had been as helpless and
irresponsible as a foolish child. Though
the burden of bringing up tho family was
thrown on her shoulders she stood brave
ly by the man whom 6he had married un-~
til death released hÂ«r. All this I learned
from another than herself.
In some respects- the years had harden
ed her, yet that night, as we sat eide by
side, watching the darkness closing in
upon the wide expanse of tho waters," she
opened her heart to me, Va stranger,"
sweetly and without bitterness, in spite of
all that ahe had suffered. '
"If only we could^nave grown old to
gether," she said. "That was always my
dream.- even as long ago as when we
were married. Have you seen that queer
little old couple who walk up and down
the deck? He is so good to her and she
leans on him so.. The tears come into. my
eyes .-when I see them, for. they are like
my dream come to lifeâ what I wanted
and what .was denied me." _.
/'Oh,. my child," she said, turning tow
ard me impulsively, and her voice, train
ed to eloquence, was musical with feel
ing: "There is nothing so beautiful In
married life as growing old together.'.'

this, men and brethren, let our halle
lujahs arise. "'
This feeling of bliss on my part is en
tirely altruistic; it moves me in behalf
of other sufferers than myself, for my
dancing days are practically over. To^be
sure, I never had much or many dancing
days, my good people having been con
vinced that dancing was a sin and that 1
the light fantastic toe tripped straight
away from heaven, but. in my wicked
way, -I took enough shies at it to walk a
few ball gown trains into something ap
proaching demolition.
I recall one sweet little girlâ bless her!
âwhom I escorted to a ball. I had known
her from her babyhood, and I am sure
that no purer or sweeter maiden lived
anywhere. On this occasion she wore her
first train, and as soon as I saw it I. felt
that Nemesis' had been spelled for me and
that my foiks were right in insisting that
he should abandon hope who entered a
dancing hall. I was right.
The trouble began and ended in our first
dance. Every fresh step I took brought
away another yard or so of' the train.
When I got done the dear girl was wear
ing no skirt worthy of mention and \u25a0 I
would. have given $5000 if. I had possessed
that sum to: have been 8000 miles away.'
Then that blessed I girl â¢ opened J her \u25a0 ruby
lips and uttered an expression such as I
am sure she never used at any other time
in her life. She said:
"Damn such clurasiâ " , \u25a0â¢'.\u25a0--> .'? v- *
She never completed the sentence, and
I did not ask her to do so, but in my
heart of hearts. l. felt that she was justi
fied. And yet I do not doubt that she
went home and breathed yards and yards
of virginal petitions â¢ for using words
which any right-minded citizeness might
have employed. Three times that evening
I asked her. to dance witn meâ this was
after the other girls had more or, less
pinned her skirt to her sylph-Uke form
but in every. instance she expressed the
deep regret she felt that she was already
engaged. Then she "sat out" those
dances, t \u25a0,\u25a0'\u25a0... : - -
It was the memory of a few such epi
sodes as tae foregoing that caused me to
lift my hallelujah, in behalf of dancing
men on receipt -of the news from Lon
don.' Doubtless I am not the .only -man
with the rare grace and, abandon of .a
cow, who has . worked havoc in a ball
room ere now, and so lots of men ought
to be pleased, while I should think that
the. women would be almost "tickled to
death." Let j the 'innovation come, and
the eooner the better.

"Tho Reconstruction of Religious Be

takes up the question of paramount
importance confronting: the tnifiker of
to-dayâ the necessity for finding some
intellectual solution of the contra
diction between science and religion.
Jli shows that while science, taken by
Itself, can supply man with no banis for
roliKion, yet it is only by closely follow
ing the methods employed by science and
by accepting; its conclusions that the
guide to the solution of the apparent con
tradiction will be found. The conclusion
thus reached is illustrated in a variety
of detailed and interesting ways. Mr.
Mellock is a prominent English writer on
political, economic and philosophic sub
lets, who has also published several nov
els anu two volumes *of verse. "Religion
es a Credible Doctrine" and "The Heart

achieved an immense success by his per
formance of "Hamlet" at the London
Lyceum Theater. His interpretation of
the part was so striking and unusual that
the play had a run unprecedented at that
time, continuing for 200 nights. (X his
exi>erience in playing this part Sir Henry
gave, some years before his death, an in
teresting account.
"I can always telt," he said, "when the
audience Is with me. It was not with me
on the first night of 'Hamlet,' which is,
perhaps, curious, considering my subse
cuent success. On the first nJjrnt I felt
that the audience did not go with me un
til the first meeting with Ophelia, when
they changed toward me entirely. But
as n!ght succeeded night my Hamlet
grow in their estimation. I could feel it
all the time, and now I know that they
like itâ that they are with me heart and

FORUM CLUB RECEPTION IS
A VERY BRILLIANT AFFAIR.
Five Hundred Smartly Gowned' Guests
Redolent With Odor \o1 l Blossoms aoGmn^hin^^ .
SALLY SHARP
In all the wide city, no gayer conclave
was there yesterday nor fairerâ than the
reception of the Forum Club, the annual
foregathering of the wit, the beauty, the
wisdom and the fashion of clubdom.
The reception hall was gay with the
sunny chrysanthemums, the woodwardla
and the caressing smilax flanking it fitly.
From a nook of woodland came the
soft strains of music, which struggled
bravely for a hearing in the buzz of 500
voices.
Quite the most interesting spot in the
room was by the side of the coffee urn or
the punch bowlâ as pleases your taste.
From tables daintily spread, buffet re
freshments were served.
No better proof that brainy women are
mostly women of tasteâ and consequently
heart womenâ could be found than the
function of yesterday: and our dear old
friend, Oliver Wendell Holmes, would be
forced to alter. hiÂ« admission that "we
love the heart women better than the
brain women" â because to-day the one in
cludes the other.
During the hours of receptionâ from 2
to 6â600 guests called, made their obeis
ance to the president and her receiving
party, and then toured the big hall to see
and be seenâ the latter the greater joy, if
the gown were getting its baptism. And
most of them wero.

made "a^demand I . that- th& petition of tho
'company filed. two years ago for a double

jtaken '.". up. ".â¢\u25a0 The., demand was made in
jVie.WiOf 'jthe fact that a subsequent ap
plication-was filed by : the- Southern Pa

lege^.on*Sixteenth' street jointly with the
Santa- f"e Railway Company.
.: 'Representatives 'of the Potrero" Im
provement ' Clnb ' objected to the laying
of any .' additional , tracks,*on Sixteenth
street 'on" the ground that the street is
the *only outlet for traffic between the
Mission -and ; the~wster , front- It was
stated that^ttia double track on the en
tire length of Sixteenth street would
damage property : in the vicinity, as the
public would be deprived of the -use of
tho "street. Slack -said the company is
rtady to pay all damages and. asked that
all necessary restrictions and conditions
bo imposed in â¢ the franchise under pain
of forfeiture. It was decided that if the
franchise of the Western Pacific Com
p;my is granted the spur track of the
Santa Fe Company wjll bo moved to one
side to make room for the double main
track.- Action on the petitions was post?
poned until next Wednesday, after Cap
tain A. 11. Payson stated to the com
mittee that the Santa Fe Company has
no objection to the Joint, use with the
Southern Pacific Company of the spur
track.
The protest filed last Monday by prop
erty owners against the ordinance de
claring Nineteenth avenue to be a boule
vard was withdrawn and the bill will be
finally passed next Monday. .
Relative to the communication of the
Works Board -requesting that the Santa
Fc. Company be required to pave Illinois
stretet under pain of revocation of its
franchise Captain Payson stated ttult the
company," according to the express pro
visions 'of its franchise, would pave tho
street when required by the Board of
Works. When tho latter -flrst requested
that the street be paved tho company
sent a reply, after an unavoidable delay,
to r the effect that Illinois street should
be 'graded and curbed before the paving
is ordered. Payson said the street needs
sewering in some portions and his re
quest that the question of the exact obli
gation of the company.be referred to the
City Attorney for /an opinion was
granted.

LOWELL BOXER HAS

O'Brien-Fitzsimmons Bout on December 20th
I CLEVER LOWELL BOXER. WHO IS I
A PRONOUNCED PUBLIC CHOICE ,
OVER BUI-LIV.VN.
Jimmy Gardner continues a pronounced
public choice over Mike Sullivan for their
fight to-morrow night in Woodward's
Pavilion. The odds quoted were 10 to 6,
but the backers of Sullivan were shy. and
but few tickets were written.
Gardner has a large following here and
it will require a decided defeat to shake
the confidence of his backers. Admirers
of the type of boxer who is at once clever
tnd a hard hitter find in him their ideal.
The opinion prevails that he lacks a bit
of gamer.ess, but he has shown no evi
dence of it in his engagements "here.
Sullivan fought Joe Gans recently, and
if the colored champion was trying it
gives the Twin a decided chance with
Gardner.
Gardner and Sullivan will each do a
little light work to-day at their training
quarters. Gardner will take a sharp
walk of three miles along the Alameda
roads, wbfle Twin will do some sprinting
over the hills near San Rafael this morn
ing, and in the afternoon about thirty
minutes at light exercise in the gymna
sium will finish the training stunt. Both
are in as good shape as four weeks of
faithful training will put a man and there
can be no excuses on that score. Bob
Fitzsimmons will be in Gardner's cor
ner.
Sullivan and Gardner are to make the
first battle between little men in this
city that has ever been fought at catch
weights. The usual weighing in on the
afternoon of the contest w}ll not be
necessary.
From the demand for tickets, which
were placed on sale yesterday at Cor
bett's, it is evident much interest cen
ters in to-morrow night's contest.
Advices were received in this city yes
terday from Manager Jim Coffroth in
which he set the date for the O'Brien-
Fitzeimmons fight for December 29th.
This will give the followers of the game
a chance to win some holiday money.
The prince of fight promoters announced
that he would arrive here . December 3
to take charge of the arrangements for
the big fight which will be held in Me
chanics' Pavilion.

SOUTH "N'ORWALK. Conn,, -Nov. 22.â
A team of girl football players from Mrs.
M. E. Meade's select seminary at Hillside
defeated the second eleven of the Mili
tary Academy of Xorwalk this afternoon
by a score of 12 to 0. The academy has
voted to take the colors and the letters
from its pupils for a month as a punish
ment.' ' â¢ - " A ' \u25a0" \u25a0\u25a0 .' * V
The game was played in ; accordance
with football rules accepted by all col
leges, and was witnessed by the Rev.
Drew Egbert of Norwalk Congregational
Church, -Edward S. Gumbert, Superin
tendent of Public Schools, and a profes
sor from the academy, who acted as offi
cials. The girls showed an inborn knowl
edge of the game. Basket-ball had tried
their nerves and strengthened their mus
cles, so that when they rushed the center
it was with surprising determination.
They were also fleet of foot. Miss Mary
D. Ider, the captain and the heaviest girl,
who played center, showed herself an
adept at kicking goals.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Nov. 22.
The thirteen men who played in the
intercollegiate football same against
California will be entertained by Cap
tain A. J. Chlamers at the ' Phi Delta
Theta fraternity house on Saturday
evening at an informal dinner. The
meeting: will serve as a reunion of the
squad. It will also be the occasion of
the selection" of captain for 1906. It ia
practically a foregone conclusion that
E. P. Stott 07, who covered himself
with glory both in the '04 and '05
fames, will be the man honored. The
only possibility is that Chalmers would
be re-elected. It is likeljf a precedent
would prevent an election of this sort
even if he would accept the nomina
tion. The men who are eligible to cast
a ballot are: A. J. Chalmers '07, R. A.

Mr. Sales of Colusa is the latest prod
uct of the bushes who came all the way
to the great metropolis to get his. The
up country pitcher- made a start like &
champion and a finish like a broken cop.
Everybody was clouting his best when
the battle waxed torrid and the young 1
man could hardly put one over that did
not go to the fence.
Sales is the young man Uncle had In
mind to transform into a Btar at the
opening of the season. A sudden injury
made it impossible for him . to bask in
the limelight when the race started. How
ever, he reserved himself for the finish:
It was a rapid one, being on the down
grade all the time with no sand on the
tracks and no fielders to linger where
the ball was wont to fall. Â»- ; \u25a0.. . \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0
Sales had an abundance of speed , when
he started, but it all seemed to dwindle
and fade away along about, the fifth In
ning. Up to that time, the game was
fairly interesting, the Tigers leading 3
to 2, with the Seals looking dangerous.
Mr. Sales seemed to lose a large quantity
of his reserve smoke in the fifth, and the
Tigers, quick to see this, began to pound
a bit and hammered two runs through.
It might have been all right had the
northern hosts quit there, but they had
a feeling in their bosoms lor more runs.
So when they all "got wised up in the
sixth to the kind Mr. Sales was passing
up, the climax was quickly reached. Five
runs, punctuated and aided by four solid
smashes, tell the tale of the overthrow
of the up country idol. It was a long
inning and a sad one and it broke up
that ball game. The score

PITCHER TOZER'S GREAT "WORK.
Xearly Equals Cheabro's Record for
Preventing: Scoring of Run*.
LOS ANGELES,' Nov. 22.â Pitcher Tozer
won his game to-day,- but failed to break*
the world's record for the number of
shut-out innings. , It was not his fault
that he did not surpass Chesbro's record
or forty-eight innings "of shut-out ball. Mn
the third inning Toman : threw the ball
into the bleachers and was responsible for
two runs, the only runs scored by Port
land. Tozer's record stands at tofty-six
innings without a run scored against him.
The: game went- eleven Innings "and "was
broken 'up when Cravath put the ball
over the center-field fence. '-As, there were
two base runners, ahead of ; him,' he will
receive credit for only a' single. Essick
pitched great ball for. ten innings. Tozer, ;
while hit more freely, was steady when
men were on bases. Score: ,

John Grace Cup Event to Be
Decided pn Saturday and

The one topic of conversation yesterday
among the owners "of greyhounds ;and
others who follow the fortunes of cours
ing: was the recent action of ihe San Ma

on thesport. â¢Â». . :"
The ortlcials of Union- Park, the only,
field affected, take a cheerful view of the
situation. .They announced at the weekly,
draw last night that they expected to be
able to continue -without interruption.
The John Grace Cup stake, the richest
event on. the coursing calendar, will be
run on Saturday and Sunday of next
week. The "ordinance does not become, op
erative until after that time. By a curi
ous coincidence this is the , event which
marked the closing of the park two years
since. That, the trainers are getting
ready for this \u25a0 event ' is shown by the
fact that' some of the fastest dogs are
out of the running this week. One stake
will be run on Sunday, the draw for

SAN NICOLAS EASILY WINS
THE EDDIE JONES HANDICAP
High GHancellor Sulks From
the Start, Rurining East. ; i
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
.Having, already, piloted two winners
over tfce line, W. Davis made it three
and out by capturing the JlOOO Eddie
Jones handicap with P. Ryan's black
horse, San Nicolas,, yesterday at Oakland.
The surprise of the race was the poor
showing made by the. favorite, : High
Chancellor, which finished last of the
five starters. , San Nicolas carried top
weight; and Davis took him out in front
at'the start. Reeling off the first mile in
I:4<H4,' he stalkd off the challenge of Lady
Goodrich, defeating the filly with ease by
a length. * Lubin experienced little diffi
culty in downing Bragg for the third
place. .; . -V.-.i--
The prospect; of viewing some good
sport drew \ another large attendance.
Four well : backed 'choices were bowled
over, the bookies having all the best of
the argument.
Rice, astride liUrene, the. contender, be
came lost in the discard, and Davis landrd
Lustig, the favorite, a handy winner at
the opening sprint. ' At the end Knupp
drove up with Metlakatla, a 10 to 1
chance, in time to nail "Entre Nous a neck
for place honors. \ . \
A number pt well defined cases of head
ache were treated at the track infirmary
after the defeat of Walter Jennings* Con
federate by Loyal Front in tho six-furlong
number for two-year-olds. It looked such
a certainty for the Jennings colt that a
crisp SlO-bill would Just about' win the
price of a full course dinner, at StevejSan
guinetti's, the closing quotation being, 2
to 9. Davis on Loyal Front got" his
mount "away sailing, while the odds-on
choice appeared to leave the barrier left
foot first. , On the stretch turn, Confeder
ate met with more ill luck and when later
Knapp forced him through on the rail he
lost the decision to Loyal Front by an
inch and a half. Sea Lad, a 150 to 1
shot, led both of the cracks into the
stretch, downing Equorum Rex a fneck
for the show.
Royalty appears to be a good hprse to
follow. All of those who strung with
him a year, ago now have splendid jobs
on the Salton cut-off at $2 50 "per" and
found. Harry Green's gelding looks des
tined to repeat his successes this season.
Blissful participated in a race on the
preceding day and it was not thought
that the mare would come back. So nine
out of ten bought some Royalty at evens,
and Blissful, with Washington' booting,
won all the way. Knapp attached him
self to the small end of the purse with
Iras. -

opinion aa to the probable outcome of thÂ«
five : furlong â¢ purse run. A gathering Of
speed from all quarters "of the globe
lined up. With everything finally set.
Fireball at 11 to 5 enjoyed the call. The
winner turned ' up lin Tocolaw. a 6% to 1
shot,- which beat Otto Stifel less than a
length in:i:oo%. < ;' Cloudlight. the early
pace maker, bore out all through the
stretch, ' carrying Andrew B. Cook . with
her. The fast filly ran third under such
adverse conditions.
Salable, a 11 to. 10 favorite, with LJoyd
Fountain on. his back, took the conclud
ing mile run. , The gelding was tiring
perceptibly at'the finish, only winning
by a neck. The show went to Terns Rod.
W. Davis in his present form appears
to be a good ono to stroll along with
when in doubt.
Lustig was boosted from 1400 to $900
by W. Collins after winning the first
race. Thu Williams stable -retained the
horso.
l.*m;i*ru.'y llros. lost Jolly .Witch from
thi! r owning event. 'xnv ttily was
claimed for $.725 by E. J. Hooper,
ownur of Dipper.
i Knapp, thu rider of Confederate,
lodged a claim of foul against Davis,
who hud the mount on Loyal Front.
Duvlh waa in no way at fault and the
Judges rejected tho claim. Confederate
seemed j out of luck altogether, for, be
sides this stumble he made on the
stretch turn as "Big Bill" took him
around Loyal Front, he made a mis
step Just after the barrier was released.
Bookmaker Billy Engstrom is a re
cent arrival from the Middle West.
Nineteen bookmakers cut in yester
day, a falling off of three from the pre
vious drawing. Tuesday's bombard
ment, when six favorites went through,
placed a crimp in several bank rolls.
C. F. McLean of Cincinnati, a former
well-known^urf official, was a visitor
at Oakland yesterday.
Charley Henschall's horses were due
to reach Ingleside track last night,
where stalls had been prepared for
them.
High Chancellor managed to get
mixed up in a. jam at the start and
would not extend himself thereafter.
Hfs owner, ll A. Bonsack, backed* the
horse heavily.
The chances are Andrew B. Cook
would have won the sprint, but for be
ing carried out by Cloudlight. The fast
filly has displayed an inclination to do
this sort of thing during morning'
workouts.

Steamer Eenders Aid When
Crew Was Exhausted From
Illness, Hunger and Thirst
NEW YORK,. Nov. 22.â A~ cargo; of
redwood, the fumes of which tainted
the food and spoiled the water, was re-.
eponsible for A terriblo adventure
which befell the German baric Werrain
In the South Atlantic Ocean and which
was reported ye3*erday by jojflcers of
the steamship Koranna. The Koranna
is in port here from Calcutta.
: While In midocean: the Koranna
sighted the bark becalmed and -flying
a distress signal for provlslqhs". Four
sailors In a boat purout from the bark
for the Koranna, and those on board
the steamship were shocked to see that
the four oarsmen reeled- In their seats
from exhaustion.. The condition of
those remaining on the bark was found
to be even more pitiful. - â¢Â«
, It was explained that a cargo of
redwood obtained, in South- America,
while still heavy. with sap, had tainted
both the food and /. water with Its
fumes. For six weeks previous to the
Koranna's app^jar&nce the twenty-two
men in the bark had drunk rain 'water
and eaten salt pork. The and
the first mate,, both /ill ' with scurvy,
had been carried to 'their bunks many
days before.-, and. the .command: of the
starving ship had, devolved upon the in
ferior officers. Every man of the crew
was ill. â¢â¢ . /- ,
Provisions and medicine were sup
plied to the bark by the Koranna, after
which the vessels parted company.
Since then the Werrain has been re
ported as safely in\port at Port Natal.
STAII KOUTE FRAUDS
TO BE SUPPRESSED
Postmaster Fisk Is Advised
; of Corrupt Practices by.
Certain Speculator's, v
Postmaster I'lsk received a communica
tion from the Postmaster General at
-Washington yesterday advising \him of
frauds In connection with bids for Star
Ruute contracts. The Postmaster' Gen
eral states that affidavits have been pre
sented to the department from which it
appears that -certain persons, through
agents, are attempting, to induce' men re
siding,upon certain mall routes that are
"to- be relet to enterinto an agreement
whereby proposals for carrying the mail
shall be submitted to the department in
the name of the local man at a rate per
haps higher than he would otherwise have
bid. In the event of his being awarded
the contract he is to share a part of the
compensation with the speculator. i
It:>s shown also by these affidavits that
the speculator through'his agent attempts
to discourage the local man from sub
mitting a bid solely in his own interest,
and to persuade him that it is to his in
terest to enter into an agreement with
4he speculator, the - speculator., setting
forth that he can furnish a bond through
a surety company, or. that he is in a po
sition before the department to- secure
S6me advantage over the local bidders.
The Postmaster General announces that
he will place such contracts in the hands
of responsible men living upon the routes
who will either perform the service in
person or give their active supervision to
its performance,' and who snail receive
the lull compensation palu by the Gov
ernment for the service, and shall' not
share any part df it with any speculator.
All contracts heretofore made or here
after to bo made otherwise than in the.
bona-tidc way ' will be annulled.

HOMA^ T IN CONTEOL
OF BELL THEATER
Euiiior That Harry Bishop
Had Secured the Manage-;
:> . nieiit Is Denied.
A report grained througrhout
theatrical circles yesterday that Harry
Bishop, manager of the Majestic The
ater and soon to manasfr the Central,
had ousted Ed Homan from the con
trol of the Bell Theater. The rumor
was laid .at rest by Homan, who ex
hibited ":- his lease of the 'new vaude
ville house and said that he is still
in active control of the theater.
Friends of Harry Bishop .made the
-statement that while in the East, re
cruiting a company for the Central
Theater, he was enabled to dispose of
bonds and stock in the Bell to a New
York theatrical firm, supposedly the
Shubert Bros., and that Homan was
practically frozen out. Incidentally, it
was given out that Homan had sold
his interest In the Midway Theater to
Mrs. John Hallinan.
Homan said that he and other local
men had shares in the stock of the Bell
Theater and that Mr. Bi3hop's interest
amounted to a fifth. . or 10.000 shares.
No other portion of the stock was up
for sale In the East and therefore
could not have been sold to the Shu
bert Bros. Homan said he sold out
his interests In the Midway of his own
will and It Is probable that the place
will closo in March of the coming year.
MAX WHO PLAYED PRACTICAL
JOKE IS IX THE HOSPITAL
Emll T. Johnson Receives Two Knife
Wounds When lie Tries to Be
Funny. â¢';Â»: Â»_^
What was intended as a joke be
tween clerks ; employed in the Union
Iron Works yesterday terminated seri
ously so far as Charles E. Lynch and
Kmll T. * Johnson are concerned.
Growing out of the affray. Johnson,
who is a married man, residing at 924
Fulton street, had two knife wounds
dressed by Dr. W. E. Buell at the Po
trero Emergency Hospital, while^Lynch
is being sought by Police Sergeant
John M. Lewis of. the Potrero station.
The trouble which culminated so
seriously had its origin in the office
where the- men, with other clerks, were
at work. Johnson, who complained of
a cold, desired the door leading into
the office closed. The others thought
it .would be a good joke to leave it
open. To finish the joke some one of
them tied a string to the knob and
made it fast, the better to carry on the
joke. This angered Johnson, who
rushed to the door and broke the
string, using uncomplimentary lan
guage to the man who tied it. From
this a small-sized row was started. In
which he received a slight cut on the
wrist and a more severe one near the
spinal* column. <
The joke ended as Lynch hurried
away without waiting to learn the re
sults of his knife thrusts. Hl3 resi
dence not being known at the office.
Sergeant Lewis was unable to place
him in custody.
To Aid St. Theresa's Church.
Mrs. M. Brady will give an "at
home" for the benefit of St. Theresa's
Church Tuesday evening:, November
28. Assisted by the members of- St.
Theresa's Institute No. 20. she will re

DR. WALSH MUST
MAKE A FIGHT
Coroner Leland Considering
Kesort to Legal Means %
to Eetain His Oilke
COURT BATTLE LIKELY
Investigation of Qualifica
tions of Other Officials-
Elect Quietly Going On
Dr. T. B. W. Inland - haa indicated
his Intention to fight for the retention
of his office against Coroner-elect Wil
liam J. Walsh, and It is likely that a
legal battle will follow. As announced
In The Call. Dr. Walsh does not pos
sess the qualifications required by tha
city charter for the holder of the of
fice of Coroner. Dr. Walsh says hÂ»
will take his seat and upset this prqs*^
vision of the charter by proving that It j
is contrary to the county government
act, which provides that a' county of
ficer need only be a resident and an
elector of the county, a citizen of the
State and have reached the ago of
twenty-one years. He possesses these
qualifications.
On the other hand. Dr. Leland places
his' faith In 'the enabling act passed by
the Legislature, which permits cltle3
the size of San Francisco to adopt
charters, which shall determine the
salaries, terms and qualifications of
their own officials. Under this act Dr.
Leland believes that If the matter be
taken to the courts Dr. Walsh will not
be given his seat and that he, the next
highest candidate, will be retained tn
office.
While Coroner Leland refuses to make
a positive statement, it Is known that
he has given consideration to the employ
ment of counsel to bring quo warrants
proceedings.
OTHER FIGHTS EXPECTED.
There Is likely to be another dis
pute over the election which will
probably find Its way Into the courts.
It Is an open question as to who will
serve as Supervisors In the places of
Andrew M. Wilson, Jennings Phillips
and J. J. Furey. provided these men
are not allowed to take their seats.
Secretary Keane said yesterday that
In such an event Mayor Schmltz.
In his opinion. had the power
of appointment, even though the
officials-elect had never been seated.
The three leading fusion candidates for
Supervisor believe that they will bÂ«r
seated because they received the next
highest number of . votes, and in case
the Mayor should Insist on making the
appointments contrary to the wishes of
the defeated candidates it is likely
that the battle will be transferred to
the courts.
CHARTER QUESTIONS.
The whole fight may center on the
question whether the* charter of
San Francisco applies to the coun
ty offices as ' well as to those
of the municipality. If the courts
decide that it does, then it will
stand and several of the officials-elect
will be ousted. The provisions of the
charter cannot be attacked where they
apply -to city officials, as was recently
decided by the Supreme Court in the
case of Sheehan vs. Scott. .In. this case
Abraham Ruef, who will probably be
the_legal representative or adviser of
those officials-elect whose seating will
be contested, was the attorney who
tried to defeat the provision of the
charter.
In the meantime a quiet investigation
of all the candidates recently elected is
being made. A thorough search of the
records is going on to show that oth
ers than those already mentioned are
disqualified from holding office. It was
stated. from reliable sources last night
that outside parties, not the" candidates
on the fusion ticket, would contest the
seating of the disqualified Supervisors
elect. The Election Commissioners
last night Issued election certificates
to; Walsh. Wilson. Furey and Phillips
along with the rest of the Union Labor
party ticket.

* NEW YORK, Nov. 22. â There was even
xr.ore Irregularity in the marktt to-day than
yesterday, when the realizing of speculative
j'l-oSt* nrst tx:Â£an to show a pronounced effect.
This process 01 profit-taking was continued oa
tin enormous 6cale to-day. The speculation,
j\ owever. .was very animated and embraced a
%^rje number of diftereat it-sues. The volume
Â«ii dealings rose to the largest aggregate of any
day en tfce movement. The action of tht
market suggested a shifting of a speculative
vtnturc on a jirodigious scale from cne set of
to another. Stlling out at som*
lninu vas accompanied by wholesale buying
st otluiis. Whether the two operations camt
fron the same sources, or sources acting in
â¢ onccrt. however, was not clear. There were
>ome indications to suggest that one powerful
speculative party was selling out, while an
othtr was making f rt-sh conamitmenUi in the
market. The profit-taking was conspicuous in
some of the etocks whicii had been the most
\u2666-ffective ]-<<<rcrÂ£ for come time past, and
whose advents were of proj>ortionate influence
on sj.*culatlve sentiment. Heading and Ameri
can were the notable examples in
this <-!ass. Tlie demonstration of the fact
thai â¢!â¢!\u25a0..â¢ was a limit to the possible extent
cf thÂ« rise in these stocks seemed to cause a
â¢ a:.-.: .;.. expressed sururise among a certain
portion of the speculative element and to dash
Ike speculative spirit accordingly. In the lat
l*r part of the day the innuenoe in \u25a0 these
stocks rather dominated the market. There
v:ns a not&bie frsnk disposition in the usual
utterances Eupi>o*t-d to represent the specula
tive views or inSuenUal leaders thai a sharp
rÂ»a<-tlcn in the market was to be looked lor
sixer ih<> violent advance, but that It was be
lieved Out hi* consummation would be de
ferred for some time. This was accepted in
f^Â»n.e quarters as an Indication that very con
siderable realization of speculative accounts
had been already acbleved, and \u25a0 that a back
turn in tip rrice movement would not be re
sanled With apprehension in such quarters.
B*t tl>Â« furious trading at new points in the
list revived the spirit of speculation in other
quarters. Brooklyn Transit was the center of
interest and the market methods employed In"
t:;* Â«Jay'Â« operations in that stock suggested the
rÂ» sum pi ion x>l a veteran speculative leadership.
The heaviest buying In that and In other
stocks which moved upward most rapidly 'was
attributed largely to houses having important
1 'hiladelpbia connections, while It was the com
mon supposition that large realizing sales were
made for account of various Western centers.
Amalgamated Copper became very active with
the ar.nouncement of an advance in the price
'-. crude copper. On the other hand, copper
ff. London was reactionary. Â» s also was silver,
land this seemed to have larger influence on
the movement la Smelting. It was not until
late In the day that a movement in Erie,
Atchison and Uclcn Pacific suggested* any
general attention to the railroad list- The
money market continued tranquil and reflected
no preparations for to-morrow" s offering of
f12,000,0G0 of New Tork City bonds, nor any
effect from the firmer tone of foreign ex
i-h&sge. The rise in. cotton was assigned as
the cause for firmer exchange rates.- The mar
ket maÂ£e some recovery from the active sell
ing tnovment cf the last hour, but the closing
was irregular.
Bonds were steady. Total sales (par value).
f5.330.000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
call.

THE COPPER STOCKS. .
A news bureau says: "It Is agreed by â¢â¢x
perts that Copper stocks above ground have
been pretty welj cleaned up and some of the
companies are selling ahead * the copper that
Is In", the mines. The present companies are
contracted for far into 3900. The price Tor.
Lake is now advancing and a quotation of 18e
a pound is considered a possibility of the not
distant future. Increased dividends have been
declared In consequence of large profits reaped
by the different companies. Under these cir
cumstances it Is predicted that the January
dividtnd on Amalgamated will be Increased â¢md
that the 0 per cent basts that Is expected to
be established will "be a permanent one. Moat
sensational advances have been scored by Ana
conda. No fact has come to light to explain
the great rise in the price of this stock this
week." - / â¢'
The Lake coppers seem to bs at a low ebb
just at present, all the grading being centered
In Amalgamated, Anaconda, North Butte and
the Utah properties. There { was good buying
of Copper Range, but the etock is still coming
out freely, and the close showed little net
gains. North Butte made a new . high recard
and closed fairly strong. .\u25a0
It (s reported that Amalgamated will ab
sorb North Butte. The par value of the latter
is $15 and it Is now selling at $75.
The buying of Daly West Is considered the
best ever seen In this stock for many months.
None offered at the moment\under 23. .

Nctt. York Cotton Market.
NEW YORK, Nov. 22. â Trading was large
and active. JThere was heavy buying by com
mission houses. Spot markets in the South
were strong and higher, with offerings light.
The movement of cotton .was not quite as
heavy as on the last few days antl operators
look for this to fall off now. We have had
an advance of 1c a pound in practically one
hour and this reaction is no more than due. ,
Hutton's Dally Cotton ..Review says: The
following telegram from Atlanta from R.
Cheatham has been received: "Juet back from
Western trip. Everything looks good, all
State departments hard at work. Belt will
be thoroughly covered. Pledges coming in so
rapidly been unable to count number bales
contained in them. Entire South, almost to
a man, In favor of the movement. ' Glnners'
report confirms our estimate. Enough, falling
off in Middle States to more than balance In
crease In Eastern States. Cannot see more
than 10,000,000 bales from any point of view."
We are in receipt of a communication from
a prominent bearish operator indicating that
false reports have been made by the ginners.
Theae same allegations were also advanced
before, but .the ginners' returns were always
verified at the end of the' sea s< in. If this is
the best argument, that the bearish operator
can advance for a large crop we think he
Is resorting to veryy weak methods of pro
cedure. \u25a0 \u25a0 . .

Supplies of .all. Feedstuff a are no more than

Hay, of which the circular of Somers & Co.
cays : . v .- â¢ . .
"Shipments of Hay continue along in about
.the lame quantities as has been noted during
the past two or three weeks. Arrivals for the
week ending to-day amount to 2SOO tons. As
usual, nearly oneâ half of the arrivals havÂ»s
been by water, and were It not for this thero
would be a famine on the market because th?
Southern Pacific Company is still unable to
furnish a* sufficient number of cars to keep
the market -supplltd. There Is' practically no
export demand, so present arrivals are suffi
cient for all needs.
\u25a0 '.'There- Is a.a '. growing Inquiry for. the lower
grades of Hay for. stock feed. The recent light
rain will hardly cause the grass to grow.
especially as rince the rain a dry. sharp north
wind has been blowing. The market remains
practically undisturbed in spite \u25a0 of weathe.*
conditions, for, with no outside, demand if
any consequence, the', fact that" country stock.V.
are very heavy is sufficient to cause every
one to feel easy, even If we should have a
shortage next year. .
."There is now a noted absence, of both Bar
ley Hay and Oat and Clover on the mark't.

with 'slow 'sale, in consequence. Onions and

HELMS LOSES JUDGMENT
Policeman Accused of Bur
glary , Must ; Pay . Wife for
Her Separate -Maintenance
After a most ' unhappy marital experi
ence of only tv/o ' months, Dr. Samuel
Zussman, whose residence is at 1042.P05t
street, filed suit J yesterday for divorce
from hl3 wife, ; Anna; . Prior ' to her ; mar
riage Mrs. Zussman was Miss Epstein;
.who resided at 1302; O'Farrell street.'.,
Dr. Zussman, who, is \ prominently
known; as a physician^ in this: .-city,'
charges his wife with extreme cruelty
and makes a most unusual series of alle
gations' against her.; He asserts' that al
most since the day of their marriage; his
wife has abused him \ roundly/ for .the
most trivial causes, cursinff him and ap
plying to him epithets showing striking
Inventive genius, one of her favorite
phrases being to refer to him as "the
low life." , â¢
Around his little six-year-old son Ed
mond, born of a prior marriage, he says
the hatred of his wife particularly ' cen-'
tered. He asserts that; when it was nec
essary for him togo out his wife. would
frequently insist upon accompanying
him, but absolutely refused ,to permit
the little fellow Sto : accompany them,
"saying that she did not purpose being
mistaken for a nurse girl," with the re
sult that the youngster; would be left'in
the home \u25a0 alone to amuse himself as
best he could or. wander the streets. , : On
various occasions,, alleges Dr. Zussman,
his wife would insist that the child be
given a beating, and upon. the refusal of
tho physician to obey her instruction she
would fly into a rage and abuse him.'.
On November 11, concludes Dr. Zuss
man, his wife deserted him and returned
to the home of her mother, and,notwith
standing his efforts to "cause her to. re
turn to him and conduct herself: as. a
wife should, she has steadfastly refused,
with the result that he asks a decree of
absolute divorce. \u25a0'.-'. : :'\< ,\L . ":

Tic Doloreux . "Queers M Matrimonial

"She winked." declared Policeman

was before Judge Mogan for disturb
ing the peace., "She winked at every
man that passed the corner of Powell
and Market streets last night Bhe
winked at me. the winked at the desk
sergeant, she winked at the captain,
and there she toes winking at you."

spasmodically. She was winking open
ly and irreverently. \u25a0
; "Make that - woman come to orderl"
thundered Judge Mogan.
"Please, your Honor." pleaded Dolly,
"I can't help It I've got tlo doloreux,
and I have to wink, whether I want
to or not"
And Bhe continued to wink vigorous
ly. "Honest, your Honor," she con
tinued, "If you knew all the trouble
this winking got me Into you wouldn't
be hard on me. Ever since I've been a
ohee-lld I've just naturally winked
myself Into hot water."
And Dolly winked some more.
"Whenever 1 asked for a job any
where this tlo doloreux knocked me
out of it I'd tell people that I was
honest. Industrious and sober/ then I'd
wink? Of course, 'people would think
that I was kidding, and I never could
get no Job. ;;.,^ : ):
"Once a fellow asked me to marry
him." Dolly winked vigorously. "After
he made his Bpiel I uaiU, 'Sure. Kid; I
never loved nobody but you.' Then I
winked. Of course, he got sore, and
I never had no use for my trousseau.
That perpetual wink knocked nae
again." i V">
"How about this charge that you
were ogling men on the street corners?"
asked Judge Mogan.
' "Honest, Judge, there's' nothing In
it,": replied Dolly with a, wink. "I was
perfectly innocent." .And Bhe winked
some more. .^
"I wasTwaitlnB T f6r."my car when the

a . lot |of fresh 'guys thought' that 1' was
winking at them. I told them. to skld

She Illustrated her falling with- in

".Let me go. Judge, and I'll wear a

-Herbert Khiron, the palmist and->as
trologer.i was permlted to depart;! by
Judge Mogan yesterday, after he: had
restored Jl6o,' " part of the money, out â¢of
which he had . swindled Robert. Gibson.
As Gibson had agreed to 'accept \u0084the
faker's note before he caused his arrest It
was'imposs.^.e to make a charge of fel
ony embezzlement stick "against the seer.
. Khiron obtained $SOO from Gibson by
advising him to Invest in bogus oil stock
handled by a confederate. Khiron has
been operating similar swindles . in this
city and In Los Angeles.
As Judge Mogan was about to adjourn
court yesterday an \ ejderly man with a
shaky hand, rose and asked to be'heard
for a moment. f.|
"I hate to delay you,- Judge," he
said, "but can't you give an old cust
tomer five days? I've been getting 1 my
sentences here for five year's,, and you
mlgrht do something: for an old
patron."
'â¢Why, It's Mr. Grler." Bald Judg-o
Mogan. affably. Isn't It a little early
for you to break out?"
"Well, It Is," your Honor," confessed
the old man. ."But I need tha five days.
I saw a red lizard chasing a blue bull
frog over the celling this morning."
"Are you sure that five will be
enouffh?" asked the Judge.
"I think five will do," said Grelr.
"Very well, then," said Judgo Mogan,
"don't, mention It,", and he signed an
order : committing Greir: to the munici
pal Ja* cure on Broadway.
Another instance of the awakening
of China was given In Judge Mogan's
court yesterday when 'Ho Tuck and
Ho Foo applied for warrants for the
arrest of two Chinamen who had held
up their \u25a0 restaurant "allee same Mell
can man." | *
\u2666 While Ho Tuck and Hoo Foo were
sorrowful over, the loss, of J5O, whicn
had, been taken by the Celestial thugs,
there was behind 'their grief a feeling:
of pride at the progresslveness of their
countrymen. The up-to-date Aslatios
burst into the restaurant; masked and
leveled revolvers at the two proprietors.
In a very, few .seconds they had emp
tied the till and disappeared.
"Allee same' Mel ican man," said Ho
Tuok, proudly. ;
/"Yes," chimed in HoFoo, "Chinaman
lobber. allee earns Melican man."
' Jeremiah Ahem had a birthday

"When Jeremiah appeared. In Judge
Mogan's court. he was repentant to the
point of weeping. "It was -my : birth

''That birthday plea_won't go/'^aald
Judge Mogan. "What's the use of'get

CHILDEEN OF BELL
SUFFER FEO3T MAXGE
Witness Tells HoW They
Contracted the Strange
" Malady.
."Tlie four children' of Mrs. Theresa
Bell were down with the mange," said
George R. 'â¢ Eaton, -while testifying yes
terday in the suit instituted by Dr. Pe
ter A. Kearney to recover $25,000 for.
medical services rendered the widow and
family of the late Millionaire Thomas
Bell. \u25a0 -;.;â¢
"With the mange?" said Mrs. Bell's
counsel, his voice denoting Incredulity.
"Yes, with the mange," answered Ea
ton. "They got it from a. pet dog, and
Dr. Kearney had to call many times to
control the strange malady with which,
the youngsters were afflicted.
"I should . think â¢ so," commented coun
sel. .
Eaton then continued his. testimony,
and said that when young Fred Bell was
bo terribly injured by a plunge over the
banisters at the . Bush-street home, the
witness,- at the suggestion of Mrs. Bell,
sent a : messenger for Dr. Kearney and
the ' physician treated Fred during " the
five months be lay In the valley of the
shadow.
Eaton, who formerly was Mrs. Bell's
private secretary, further testified that
Dr. Kearney frequently visited â¢ the So
noma County ranch and treated various
members of the family. By way of com
ment he'sald that the late Mammy Pleas
ant, the notorious negress of the Bell
household, ran things at the ranch, em
ploying and discharging the help and
doing as she pleased. ;
Conrad Herman, a nurse, who cared for
Fred Bell during his illness following bis
fall, also testified that Dr. Kearney con
stantly - attended \ the members " of . the
family, as alleged by the plaintiff. The
case goes on again to-day. \-y
