BERLIN, Feb. 23.â The Emperor of
Russia has elected to continue the war.
His position ia absolutely firm and the
German court has been advised in that
sens*. The war will be pressed with
the utmost energy, the domestic situa
tion being now within the control of
the authorities.
The Emperor's reasons for deciding
to continue the war are:
Firstâ The Judgment of the chiefs of
the army that Field Marshal Oyama
not only cannot defeat General Kuro
patkin, but stande in danger of defeat
himself. How cowardly therefore for
Russia to ask for mercy with all the
men and money essential to a success

Second â All the forces of criticism
now directed against the Government
for having fought rather than yield to
legitimate interests, and for having:
failed to win victories would be con
tinued with increased fury against the
Government. A Government that
would crave peace of Russia's enemy
while Elill capable of winning victory
would be given - the party of change

facts of the military situation, love of

SAN BERNARDINO, Feb. 88. â Ar
thur F. Thomas is in Jail in Riverside
for having attempted with a revolver
to frighten pretty Miss Clara Waite,
an inspector of singing In the public

appealed to the Sheriff's office and the
City Marshal for protection, saying
Thomas had been making life unbear
able for her by forcing his attentions
upon and frightening her.
The Sheriff and Marshal concealed
themselves In the young lady's room
and it was not long before Thomas
entered boldly. Taking a large revol

upon a table in the room, he reiter
ated his demand that she marry him.
"Do you see that^un?" said Thom

The officers were so close to him
behind the thin curtain that they
could almost touch his shoulders, but
not wishing to cause a scene in the

"I'll give you three days to decide

Jerome Denounces

Special Dispatch to TbÂ« Call.
NRW YORK, Feb. 28.â District At
torney Jerome, speaking before the
People's Institute Club to-night, said:
"There are some honest men on the
police force. But if the people knew
the truth about the bulk of the higher
police officials they would take the
law In their own hands, like the people
of Montana and California with their
vigilance committees, and annihilate
them. When you remember that the
collection of %l tribute for each saloon
In a precinct would in some of the
larger precincts amount to $12,000 a
year, you will have some idea of the
possibilities.
"More than this, even to-day there
is not a street on which cars run that
pickpockets are not operating under
a distinct contract with the central
office detectives. There is now a man
awaiting sentence in the Tombs â and,
even though he is a thief I believe
him, for I have corroborated much
that he told me â who says that the
police demanded 50 per cent as their
part of the proceeds."
Jerome declared that the corruption
of the police force .was largely due to
the existence of a liquor law that was
unenforceable, in the sense that the
community was against its* strict en
forcement, not that the officials w*-e
powerless to enforce it if they want

North Sea Commission Re
port Takes Middle
Ground.
PARIS, Feb. 23. â The International
Commission appointed to inquire into
the North Sea incident practically con
cluded its work to-night by finally
agreeing to the report, which will be
publicly announced next Saturday.
Concerning the general nature of the
report the following statement was
made:
"When the text of tne decision be
comes known it will be more accept
able to the press and public than they
have been led to believe. The semi
official summaries appearing, while
more or less accurate, tend too strong
ly to show Russian success, but as a
matter of fact the admirals have
sought a middle ground, and the deci
sion is not a pronounced victory for
either side. It is of such character as
to preserve Russia's self-respect and
at the same time give the British pub
lic much ground for satisfaction. If
anything, the decision is rather more
favorable to Great Britain than to
Russia."
On the other hand, the Havas Agen
cy to-night confirmed its semi-official
statement of last night. It says:
"The conclusions as a whole are quite
favorable to Russia, recognizing that
Admiral Rojestvensky could legiti
mately have considered himself in
danger and acted as he did. However,
the report contains reservations to sat
isfy British susceptibilities."
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 24.â The in
timation that the decision of the Inter
national Commission on the Hull af
fair will be favorable to Russia is re
ceived with much quiet exultation in
Admiralty circles and by the St. Pe

show the baselessness of "the senseless
clamor" against Vice Admiral Rojest

Continues.
Net Slump Since President
Ordered Investigation
Totals $41,000,000.
Price of Shares Depreciates Ten Points
on the New York Curb in a
Single Day.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
NEW YORK, Feb. 23.â Standard Oil
stock to-day continued the decline
which has been a feature ever since
President Roosevelt ordered an in
vestigation of the company through
the Department of Commerce and
Labor. This, added to the warfare
waged against the company by various
Western and Southern States, is held
solely responsible for the slump in
values.
Ten points more were lopped off the
price of the stock to-day on the Broad
street curb, the market issue selling
down from $600 to $590. This is equiva
lent to a depreciation of $10,000,000 on
the market value of the company's
outstanding stock of $100,000,000.
Standard Oil sold as high as $650
a share on February 14, but it closed at
$646 on that date, which was that on
which President Roosevelt's deter
mination for an investigation was an
nounced.
In the Intervening nine days the
stock was said ex. the quartely divi
dend of 15 per cent, so that the net
decline during the period, at to-day's
closing figure, has been forty-one
points, marking the tremendous depre
ciation of $41,000,000 in the market
value In a short space of time, or, at
this rate, of $4,555,555 a day.
The sales of stock are increasing
somewhat as selling pressure has de
veloped. Upward of 250 shares. In lots
ranging from one to thirty-five each,
were marketed to-day.
SWEEPING ANTI-TRUST BELL.
Measure designed to Drive All Monop-
olies Out of Illinois.
SPRINGFIELD, 111., Feb. 28. â To
prevent the formation of trusts In
Illinois in the future and to force the
dissolution of any that may now exist
is the purpose of a bill which has
been prepared by Atterney General W.
H. Stead and which will be introduced
in the Legislature within a few days.
The Stead anti-trust bill is more com
prehensive in its definition of what
constitutes a trust than any measure
heretofore passed in the Illinois Legis
lature, It also confers on the Attorney
General greater power with regard to
the prosecution of such combinations.
The bill follows, mainly, the anti-trust
act of 1593, which was declared uncon
stitutional by the Supreme Court be
cause of a clause exempting agricul
tural products from its operation. But
the definition of a trust is widened in
the Stead bill by a new clause, which
includes combinations among insurance
companies, banks or any form of busi
ness. His new definition reads:
"To combine in any agency or asso
ciation, or join In any contract or
agreement to establish uniform or non
competitive rates of interest, insurance
or compensation to be charged for loan
of money or guarantee of indemnity
for loss of life or property, but acci
dent, casualty or disease."
This clause would reach directly
organizations like insurance under
writers. The bill empowers the Attor
ney General to proceed by injunction
to prevent the formation, operation or
continuance of a trust. It is expected
that the measure will pass.
TOBACCO TRUST INVESTIGATION.
House Will Pass Resolution Calling
for an Inquiry.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 23. â The to
bacco trust Is the latest corporation
to be investigated by the Bureau of
Corporations. A resolution was intro
duced in the House to-day by Repre*
sentatlve Keho of Kentucky calling
for an Investigation. It is modeled
after that which was adopted in the
cases of the beef trust and Standard
Oil. Because of this, members say
it will be adopted without objection.
Every trust, they claim now, must
be investigated at once, that no charge
of inconsistency can be made.
Within the past year the House, by
resolution, has authorized the De
partment of Commerce and Labor,
through the Bureau of Corporations,
to investigate the beef trust, the
Standard Oil trust and the steel
trust. The department has power
under the organic act creating it. but
in each case it has been held that a
special resolution should be adopted
at once to have the Investigation start
ed immediately.
Condemns Standard Oil Company.
LINCOLN, Neb., Feb. 23. â The low
er house of the Legislature to-day
adopted the resolution condemning
the Standard Oil Company, but
amended it so as to eliminate that
part referring to John D. Rockefellers
gift to the University of Nebraska. Ag
passed, the resolution commends the
legislation in Kansas and indorses the
position of President Roosevelt.

Declared to Be
Unjust.
Interstate Commerce Com
mission Renders Lengthy
Opinion.
Holds Southern Pacific and Santa Fe
to Be Unlawfully Engaged in
Pooling Traffic.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 23.â The Inter
state Commerce Commission, in an
opinion by Commissioner Clements, to
day rendered its decision in the Cali
fornia orange cases brought by the
Southern California Fruit Exchange
and the Consolidated Forwarding Com
pany against the Southern Pacific and
Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Rail
road systems, in which it holds that
the defendant carriers are unlawfully
engaged in pooling the traffic in citrus
fruits originating â¢in Southern Cali
fornia and carried by them and their
connections to Eastern marker; that
the defendants, by compelling the ship
pers to pay icing charges as estab
lished by the car lines have made such
charges part of the cost of transporta
tion and subject to regulation under
the law, and that the rate on oranges
in carloads from Southern California
to points on and east of the Missouri
River are unreasonable and unjust.
The rate on lemons is held to be rea
sonable and present refrigerating
charges are held to be not unreason
able.
This decision by the commission is
on questions reserved in a former de
cision by the commission in the same
cases which prohibited carriers from
denying to shippers of citrus fruits
from California to Eastern markets the
right of directing over which of the
established lines the shipments should
be carried.
RULINGS ARK MADE.
Rulings are also made as follows in
the decision now rendered:
The carriers' minimum carioad
weight of 26,000 pounds on citrus fruit
In refrigerator or ventilator cars from
Southern California points to Eastern
destinations Is not unreasonable with
the forty-foot car In general use.
Whether or not the regulating statute
applies to refrigeration charges in all
cases, the defendants, by compelling
shippers to pay icing charges in citrus
fruits as established by the car lines
or do without necessary refrigeration
for the traffic, have made these charges
a part of the cost of transportation and
subject to regulation under the law.
The refrigeration charges applying
on these shipments of citrus fruits to
Eastern markets have been reduced
during the pendency of this proceeding
and the present charges for refrigera
tion are not found, on the record in
this case, to be unreasonable.
The defendant carriers are unlawfully
engaged in pooling the traffic In citrus
fruits originating in Southern Cali
fornia and carried by them and their
connections to Eastern markets, but
further action on that branch of the
proceeding is reserved by the commis
sion In view of the pendency in the
United States Supreme Court of an ap
peal from a like decision of the Circuit
Court for the Southern District of Cali
fornia in a suit brought by the com
mission to enforce its order as to the
routeing regulation above mentioned.
LEMON RATE IS FAIR.
The defendant carriers' present rate
of $1 per 100 pounds on lemons in car
loads from Southern California to
points on and east of the Missouri
River is apparently reasonable.
The defendant carriers' rate of $1 25
per 100 pounds on oranges in carloads
carried from Southern California to
points on and east of the Missouri
River is unreasonable and unjust, and
in the opinion of the commission i
should be reduced 15 cents per 100
pounds, but if the time of service to
Eastern markets should be restored to
the old basis as indicated by eight days
to Chicago and twelve days to New
York, a rate as high as $1 15 would per
haps be fair and reasonable.
Commissioner Prouty concurs in the
proposed order and recommendation of
the commission, but does not arree
with some of the facts found and con
clusions drawn in the majority opinion.
Such concurrence is based mainly on
the ground that the $1 25 rate on oranges
Is unreasonable because the time
necessary in transporting the/c fruits
to Eastern markets has been srreatly
lengthened. Chairman KnaPD dissents
from the decision. The chairman says
that in several important particulars
the findings in the majority report do
not accord with his understanding of
the proofs, while the inference therein
drawn is not warranted In his lude
ment, by due consideration of all the
facts and circumstances entitled to be
taken Into account; and further, that
even if the specific findings in the ma
jority opinion be accepted as a fair and
accurate summary of the facts and cir
cumstances entitled to be considered,
he still is constrained to hold that the
unreasonableness of the rate has not
been established.

by Widow of Late President of

The Western Pacific Railway project
is backed by the Huntington million*
and not by the gold of the Goulds, aa
as been generally suspected by the
public since that big railroad under
taking began to take definite shape.
From the coffers of Mrs. Coilis P.
Huntington. widow of the late West
ern railroad magnate, is coming the
bulk of the money used to carry out
the plans of the new overland road
between San Francisco and Salt Lake.
To the contributions ahe is making
there is being added funds mainly
from her nephew, Henry E. Hunting
ton, and his associates in several gi
gantic schemes. Millionaires B. F.
Yoakum, president at the "Frisco
System," and E. W. Hawley, who is
prominently identified with a number
of railroad enterprises.
This statement does not emanate
from street rumors or ' from stock
market speculations," but come
from a high authority, a prominent
financier of New York, who is now in
this city and Is close in touch wit
the men who are Interested in *th

statement â and it would â¢ hardly need
further ' substantiation than the sim
ple mentioning of his name, .which nÂ©
will not permit â the Western; Pacific
scheme -waa conceived in -th mind of
Henry 12. HirntinsrtoTi and made pos-
sible through financial assistance of
his famous uncle's widow and â !
Hawley and Yoakum. The Goulds
have a holding in the corporation,
but only in a nominal way. although
the founders of the enterprise have
permitted the Impression to grow that
the Goulds are really the backbone of
.the undertaking.
Huntingdon, Hawley and Yoakum
are not only planning a road to Salt
Lake City, but propose acquiring a
complete system from San Francisco
to the Mexican Gulf by way of the
Denver gateway and making traffic
arrangements with other roads with
a view to getting connections at Den
ver or Salt Lake for through passes
ger and freight business to tlv
souri River and Chicago. It was the
Galveston outlet to the Southern Pa
cific that gave the late Collis P. Hun
tington a Samson lock on the West
ern traffic situation, and It was the
realization of this fact that prompted
H. E. Huntincton and his associates
in the new enterprise to seek a sim
ilar outlet at the gulf port.
To that end they have been quietly
acquiring terminals at Galveston and
rights of way between that city and
Houston, with a view of soon building
from Galveston to Fort Worth, con
necting at the latter point with the
Colorado Southern, of which they
have already acquired a controlling
interest, and by that route getting to
Denver. From Denver they will reach
Grand Junction over the rails of the
Colorado Midland, in which they have
a half interest and hold the chief ex
ecutive positions. It will then re
main for them to decide whether they
will use the Rio Grande Western as
far as the proposed Eastern terminus
of the Western Pacific, or build their
own road between the two points.
It is claimed that no one interested
in the gigantic railroad project is
more enthusiastic over its achieve
ment than Mrs. Collis P. Huntington.

completed and the Huntington namÂ«
again conspicuously identified with
Western railroading. It has been

WASHINGTON, Feb. 23. â 'Uncle

his attention was called to Dr. Wil

While the barber tickled "Uncle

vievvs."
Senator Stewart of Nevada, who is
7 7 years old, remarked: "I am glad
the doctor has given us the key to his
numerous failures. 1 am sorry that a
crank of his type treated Senator Han
na, Speaker Reed, Postmaster General
Payne and other distinguished Amer
icans."
Senator Pettus of Alabama, 84 years
old. said: "I know Dr. Osier very
well, but I very much doubt if he
would subscribe to the chloroform
theory of putting an end to a lot of
youngsters like myself.
"Why, bless your soul, the best
work I ever did in my life was after
I was 50 years of age. I did not know
all of the law, but I managed to know
as much as the other fellows who op
posed me and I do not regard myself
as incapacitated for further active
service because of my age."
Senator Allison of lowa, 76 years
old. said: "I cannot subscribe to Dr.
Osier's views on this subject. Some
men are much better at 60 than they
are at 4 0."

AND GOVERNOR WILL SIGN IT.

Keeping of the Government.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 23.â The great;
Yosemite Valley and the incomparable
Marlposa big tree grove will be re- j
ceded t_o the Federal Government, i
| After a debate lasting the greater part
of the day, the Senate finally paÃsed
Ralstons bill providing the recession, ,
the vote being 21 to 13. The vote on
the quoetlon was as follows:
Ayes â Anderson, Bauer, Belshaw,
Broughton, Carter, Coggins, Greenwell,
Hahn, Hoskins, Irish, Leeke, Markey,
Mattos, McKee, Pendleton, Roweli,
Savage, Shortridge, Simpson, Ward
and Woodward.
Noesâ Curtin, Diggs, French, Keane,
Leavitt. LukÂ« i ns, Lynch, Nelson, Ral
ston. Sanford, Welch, Wolfe and
Wright.
The question came up as a special
order for reconsideration this morning.
The first to take the lloor in support of
the Tail! was Senator Ward of Chula
Vista.
Senator Ward spoke in favor of the
bill. He said it was a wise trust Cali
fornia accepted when it took the Yo
semite many years ago, but now that
the President of the United States has
said that the burden of the care of the
great park should be transferred to the
Federal Government, he believed it
should be. The millions of people of
this land, he continued, now have equal ;
interest in the valley and it would be
an act of wisdom to enable all to con
tribute to the valley's support and pay
for its development as a pleasure land.
He pointed to the Improvement!
that have been installed in Yellow- i
stone Park by the National Govern- '
ment. He said its streams had been
stocked with the choicest fish, its j
I forests stocked with game and its !
I accommodations brought up to the
standard of the finest resorts in the !
! world. All of this, he said in conclu
sion, would be done for Yosemite by
the United States should California i
surrender its trusi, which it should
! do, acting on broad principles of
'â  patriotism to the nation and to the I
State, which will be greatly bene- ]
: fited should re-cession be authorized. I
Senator Ralston said the question I
of re-cession was one that should be j
decided by all the people of the State
and not the Legislature.
"There is now before this body.'.' |
,he said, "a proposed constitutional
: amendment that will place this ques
tion fairly before %he people and en
able them to decide the question for
'â¢ themselves. Let us proceed on this
. plan and we can make no mistake."
Sanford spoke bitterly against the
bill.
"I have listened with considerable \
patience,' he said, "to the declaration ;
here that the proper thing to do is
to give away the grand, sublime Yo
semite. But out of all of this song
I find but one refrain, and that is that
California is too poor to keep the
valley. This I deny, and I ask you to
vote down the bill."
When Sanford concluded his remarks
a recess wag taken till 2 o'clock p. m.
This afternoon the opposition was
broken when Senator Charles M. Short
ridge took the floor in favor of the bill.
He announced that he had yielded to
the pressure of his con&tituents, which
was so strong that nc c^uld not in
Justice to them folly.v his own views
on the question and that in conse
quence he would vote for the bill.
Curtin spoke at length against i.hÂ»
bill, raising :he same points, legal anJ
! sentimental, he did when the bill first
came up. Roweli next spokt- 1n favor :
<>f the bill and the debate wan closed
by Belshaw, its- author, and the vote
was called.
The bill will be signed mmed'ately
by Governor Parade, who has strong
ly favored the measure from the begin
ning, and the United States can then
enter into possession at its pleasure.

SACRAMENTO, Feb. 23.â The As

great deal of business. The general
appropriation bill was passed. Stan
ton, chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee, said that his committee
had broken the record by getting the
bill in on the fiftieth day of the ses
sion. There is a cry among the As

their appropriation bills is resulting in
giving the Senators from the various

ing appropriations, as their bills will
get through first and be substituted
for the house measures.

DEATH PACKAGE
FOR A SENATOR
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Feb. 26.âAd
dressed to United States Senator Pen
rose at Waahin-ton, an ingeniously
constructed infernal machine was
found done up in an innocent looking
package in a private mail box in a
hallway at 1210 Market street this
morning. Archibald J. Williams, a
photographer, to whom the mailbox
belonged and who discovered the pack
age, turned it over to Captain of De
tective* Donaghy.
There was sufficient gunpowder and
nltro-glycerin in the package to have
wrecked the building. An attempt to
open it in the ordinary way undoubt
edly would have caused it to explode.
The outside of the package consisted
of a plain white pasteboard box, on
which was pasted the following in
scription, evidently copied from the
headlines of a paper or circular:
"For Senator Penrose, Congress,
Washington."
On a second wrapper was the inscrip
tion: â¢
"President Roosevelt, we are not in
any trust; time limited; Inauguration."
This inscription was constructed by
many who saw it to mean that some
thing would be done at the inaugura
tion, possibly an attempt at assassina
tion. One line on this wrapper read:
"A test of power of trusts run down."

Board.
SDeclal Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 23.âCondem
nation of the financial methods that
have obtained in the past and still
obtain in a measure at the University
ot California is contained in a report
filed to-day by the Senate committee
that recently investigated that insti
tution. The Regents come in for un
sparing criticism and the committee
recommends that, notwithstanding the
fact that they serve the Suite without
pay, their carelessness that enabled
former Secretary \V. A. McKowen to
embezzle more than $60,u00 was so
glaring thai theyv should be held liable
lor the entire loss diid that proper
proceedings be taken to obtain re
imbursement.
The committee further brings to
! light the startling fact that the univer
1 siiy is about to lose between $40,000
. t'nd $50,000 on a mortgage through
, the carelessness of a former attorney
I of the institution, not named, though
i it cannot be told at this time whether
, or not the loss will prove a total one.
The committee was composed of
I Senators Carter Lukens,
I I.eeke, Selvage and Sanford. After set-
I ting forth the details of the financial
system that prevailed at the univer
sity at the time of McKowen's de
falcation, it goes on to say:
LOOSE METHODS FOUND.
Secretary W. A. McKowen kept the books
ot the Board of Regents and so far as the
evidence discloses there was no supervision
exercised over him by the Regents or the
president of the university with reference to
keeping the accounts and the receipts of money
collected for the university except that the
Board of Regents employed John J. Herr to
make an occasional examination of the boofcs.
The testimony of Mr. Herr on this subject was
that he never examined the books except when
atked to by the secretary himself and that
It? was often delayed and put off In the ex
amination by the secretary on his excuse that
the books were not posted up Â»nd ready to
be audited.
Aftpr each examination of the books made
by the auditor he gave to the Regents a cer
tificate of his examination, naming therein
the books that he had examined, which, in all
cases, he reported he had found to be correct.
Auditor Herr made no report of shortage or
defalcation by the secretary.
The books were not audited for a period of
one year, extending from December. 1902, to
the time of the defalcation In December, 190-'!.
The testimony shows that Items appeared in
the minute books of the Regents of cash re
ceived by the secretary that were not entered
i:i the cash book in which entry should have
been made. In one particular instance, an
Item of ?r>oo. a donation to the university by
the Emanu-EI Fellowship in Semitic Lan
guages, was Riven to President Wheeler ana
by him reported to the Beard of Regents at
tlieir following regular meeting. The item
appeared In the minutes of the board as hav
ing been rereivpd by President Wheeler and
payment of the same, to the seorftary. A
pri per auditing; of the books would have dls
i losed the omission and put the auditor and
finance committee of the Regents upon In
vestigation of the accounts.
Another Instance in: which', the iryjri'aritks
of the - secretary could" easily . have- besn riis
covered v. is ; found in the- statement '.'received'
from the treasurer, of .the Regents- crediting
a donation by Claus > Sprrt-eKls to the univer
sity, amounting â  to , $11, S2. : The . It.-m Â»vas
eraacd by a pen mark through It andrchmiKcd
to : read: , "Medical department reer* Tho
changed words . were in different handwriting'
and different colored .'ink. : and. by the : testi
mony of Mr. Herr. proved to be in McKnwen'B
handwriting. 1 This .change, had the effect of
placing. $11,675 82 to the credit of the medical
durerinient . fund?.* from ;â  which the secretary
had been stealing for several months past.
In relation, to this fund tlte; secretary's books,
showed that .there was charged up to it a
.sum approximating $11,000 between the months
of January and March. 100.1, â¢ while there was
no money whatever; orr.^t- : to the fund until
the Claus Spreckels â  warrant was diverted to
meet payment of that -fund. .-.'
BOND HAD EXPIRED. â¢
The' above insularities are so, glaring that
the ' auditor , should - ha"Â« discovered the samÂ».'
and,' even had the Resents examined the books,
the irregularities would have been readily dis
covered. ' ". V - â . -\ : 1
: It "further appeared from â  the â  evidence that
the Board r of Regents had fixed the amount of
the bond of the secretary,, at only $50<JO as se
curity against, defalcation, but the hoarrl had
even allowed this ' bend to expire no July i;
inf.:;. without reno.val of the same. The -defal
cation ;of . the secretary was discovered in De
cember, of that : year. In other word*, the sec
retary, was ; without bonds: for about y six
months/ We further j find: that r upon' the dis
; covery Jof :â¢ the " defalcation the Board of 'Re
gents -recovered from McKowen â  certain real
and. persona! property * of .; doubtful â  value, np
uroximating $3000; that the Paclfl; Surety
Company.' which bonded th 1 secretary, has re
fused to pay the amount. of the bon-J. -, alleging
that it -Is -exonerated by, breach of the condi
tions of ' the v bond.*. Â£ 'â  ' , -â  ' . ',-â '.
It appears, further, that in auditing the ac
counts of the university neither the auditor
nor the Regents of the university made any
examination and have not to this day caused
an audit or examination to be made of the
tr^ayurer's book? or the hooks of the medical
department. It appears that it has been and
is now the custom for the treasurer to furnish
a monthly statement of money; received by
him and that former Secretary McKowwi used
this statement from which to post his books.
Your committee further finds that the
finance committee of the Board of Regents,
since 1900, gave ho time at all to a personal
examination of the accounts or personal su
pervision of the books: that they gave no in
struction whatsver to the auditor as to the
manner or how the books should be audited
and took no steps to ascertain whether or not
the system of keeping the accounts was effi
cient for the purpose.
" Tlie : committee . further finds that . lmmedlate

the i: Regents 'â  employed : exnert ' bookkeepers C to

LEGISLATURE DEALS DEATH BLOW
TO CAUSE OF WOMAN'S SUFFRAGE
Assembly and Senate Defeat Proposed
Measure After Sharp Debate.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 23.â Woman's
suffrage again went down to defeat in
the Senate this morning. Called up
on special order, the question was
again the subject of debate, but it
fell three votes short of the necessary
twenty-seven ballots. Senator Short- ;
ridge, upon whose motion the question
ot the proposed constitutional amend
ment granting the women of the State
the right to vote was reconsidered,
v.-as first to address his colleagues in '
behalf of the measure.
"It is not a question of policy that
here confronts us," said Senator
fcfhortridge, "but a question of referen
dum. At the time of the last debate
upon this question Senator Wolfe of
.San Francisco said he would like to I
leave the question of women's suf
frage to the women of the State. I
will leave it to the women; to the
shop girls that work for half the wages
lÂ»aid to men in similar positions, to the
girls in the canneries that labor
through the weary hours for a pit
tance. I will leave it to the toiling
women that bear the burdens of taxa
ticn without representation."
Senator Anderson followed Short
ridge, speaking in favor of the pro
posed amendment. Wolfe opposed rt.
The call for the vote was then made
and the measure was defeated by a
vote of 11 against and 2 4 in favor, 2*
being necessary to carry under the
two-thirds rule.
In the Assembly the debate on the
measure was heated.
"1 am not a married mao like many
of the other members of this house,
but 1 hope to be, and when I do get
married I do not want my wife run
ning around doing politics. The girl
I am going to marry doesn't want to
do politics and if she did I wouldn't
marry her."
This oublic announcement of his en
gagement by Assemblyman Espey, a
statesmanlike speech by Gus Hartman
of the Fortieth District of San Fran
cisco, and a split in the Fresno dele
gation over the subject were the main
features of the discussion of woman
suffrage that raged this morning and
resulted in a call of the house, during
which the unprecedented action of :
sending the sergeant-at-arms after the
Speaker, that his vote might be record- ,
cd. was taken. v
Treadwell championed the cause of ;
the suffragists. The matter before the ]
house was the passage of his consti
tutional amendment giving women the
right to vote. The Senate had Just
defeated the amendment by only two j
votes, he said, and he hoped the As
sembly would pay the women of Call- â¢
fornia the compliment of giving them
another chance.
Olmsted said he had the greatest re
spect and esteem for the ladies of Cali
fornia, but he did not believe that a
majority of them wanted to vote. Ex
perience elsewhere taught that the

TO COLLECT SHORTAGE.
Wherefore, your committee rasptctfully rec
ommends :
First â That the Board of Regents immedi
ately provide a system for examination and
auditing of the booKs of the treasurer and
medical department of the university, and pro
vide for a system of triplicate receipts, to be
given by the treasurer and persons receiving
feÂ«s for the medical department and for any
other officer or department or" the university
receiving money of the institution, similar to
the plan now adopted for the secretary, and
that the books relating to fiscal transactions
be experted at least seml-annually.
Secondâ Your committee, whtlo fully appre
ciating the fact that the Regents of the uni
versity are serving the State without pay and
purely out of a feeling of patriotic duty to
the university, yet rrcogniie that in doing so
the Regents have assumed an Important trust
â one that once undertaken should be executed
with care and diligence. The loss sustained
being one that could have been avoided by the
ordinary care and diligence that the Regents
would have exercised In their own business
leads the committee to the conclusion that the
Regents are under obligation to reimburse the
funds of the university to the full extent of
the defalcation by McKowen. "We therefore
recommend that the proper proceedings b*
taken to obtain reimbursement of the said
losses.
Third â Tour committee further recommends
that the Regents should use in the construction
and furnishing of all buildings the exclusive
product of the State of California in all cases
where the same is available and meets the
test required by builders and architects of the
same character of building In private work,
where the cost is not greater than the foreign
article.

TOOK A STRAW VOTE.
Interesting Experiment In a Restaur-
r ' ant.
,â¢ 'An advertising agent, representing a
prominent New York magazine, while
on a recent. Western trip, was dining
one evening in a Pittsburg restaurant.
While -waiting for his order he
glanced over his newspaper and no-
ticed the advertisement of a well-
known " dyspepsia preparation. Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets. As he himself
was -a. regular 'user" ol the tablets he
began speculating as ;to how many
of the other traveling, men in the
dining-room were also friends of thÂ»
poDplar . remedy for indigestion.
'^â¢fTfe says: "I counted twenty-thre*
men at the tables, and In the hotel
office I took the trouble to interview
them and was surprised to learn that
nine of the twenty- three made a
practice of taking one or two of Stu-
art's Dyspepsia Tablets after each
meal. â 
. One of them told me he had suf-
fered so much from stomach trouble
that at one time he had been obliged
to Quit the road, but since using Stu-
art's Dyspepsia Tablets he had been
entirely free from indigestion, but
he continued their use. especially
while traveling, on account of irregu-
larity in meals and because. like all
traveling men. he was often obliged
to eat what he could get and not al-
ways what he wanted.
Another, who looked the picture of
health, said he never ate a meal with-
out taking a Stuart Tablet afterward
because he could eat what he pleased
and when he pleased without fear of
a sleepless; night or any other trouble.
Still another used them because he
was subject to gas on stomach, caus-
ing pressure on heart and lungs,
shortness of breath and distress in
chest, which he no longer experienced
since using the tablets regularly.
Another claimed that Stuart's Dys-
pepsia .Tablets was the only safe
remedy â¢he had ever found for â¢ sour
stomach and acidity. He had for-
merly used common soda to . relieve
the trouble, but the tablets were much
better, and safer to use.
After smoking, drinking or other
excesses which weaken the digestive
organs, nothing restores the stomach
to a healthy, wholesome condition so
-effectually as Stuart's Tablets. -
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets - contain
the natural digestives, pepsin, dias-
tase, which every weak stomach lack.*,
as well as nux, hydrastln and yellow
par ilia, and can be safely relied on as
a radical cure for every, form, of poor
digestion. Sold by . druggists every-
where. ... * <

President Maps Out Pro

cutions on This Coast
WASHINGTON, Feb. 23.â As the re
sult of conferences held at the White
House to-day with President Roosevelt
further developments in the land fraud
cases in Oregon and California may be
expected at no distant day. Since the
first steps were taken looking to the
prosecution of the alleged offenders the
President has shown a keen interest in
the investigations which have been
made and in the indictments which
followed. With the view of acquaint
ing himself with the situation as it
exists up to the present time the Presi
dent to-day was in close conference
with Secretary Hitchcock. Attorney
General Moody and Special Attorney F.
J. Heney. who discussed with him the
evidence so far gathered.
Later he held a second conference, at
which were present Hitchcock, Heney
and Pf< ret Service Inspector William
D. Burns, who was active in bringing
about a number of the arrests. At this
latter meeting, it is understood, a plan
tion was manned out and the
â¢statement was made to-night that it
need not occasion surprise if further
arrests are ordered. To Burns, it is
understood, the President conveyed hi?
varm commendation for weaving
around the alleged offenders a chain of
evidence on which the indictments
were prepared.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Feb. 23.
âIf such a thing were possible to man,
it would be a work of great kindness
and pleasure for some one to call old
Ben Jonson's shade back to life and
escort him down to Stanford to witness
a revival of his own favorite comedy,
"Every Man in His Humor," acted b>
a company of twentieth century col
lege men and maids on a sixteenth cen
tury stage. He would appreciate the
copy of the old stage of the Swan
Theater, for the Stanford players,
dressed in eveiy detail like Will
Shakespeare. Richard Burbage. Theo
dore PoDe and other noted actors who
took part in the first presentation of
the comedy, have built an exact coun
terpart of the old London theater's
boards.
As on the opening night of the great
comedy, nearly three centuries ago,
when Queen Elizabeth, Sir Walter Ra
leigh and a score of handsome court
ladies and gay knights sat in the boxes
above the stage and applauded the
clever work of the famous actors, so
in a short time will a stately queen
and her constant attendants be found
in the boxes of the curious old stage in
the Stanford playhouse listening to the
words of Will Shakespeare mouthed by
his counterpart, a gay Stanford profes
sor. John Bonnell.
The production of "Every Man in
Hi? Humor"' at Stanford on March 8
and 11 is another step in the general
revival of interest in the early classic
drama that has found root here on the
Pacific Coast.
While "Every Man in His Humor" is
a comedy, it is entirely different from
"The Knight of the Burping Pestle."
In the latter play the fun was in the
situations and it was uproarious, broad
and burlesque. Jonson's comedy de
pends for its humor largely on the
cleverness of the dialogue. It is a
character study and the wit is of a
fine nature. Beneath its" apparent com-
I'kxity the main lines of the plot are
simple. The author has brought to
gether many characters of different
natures, whose characteristics are ox
pressed in their names. There is CaD
tain Bobadil, a bragging soldier; Kite
ly, the merchant; Cash, the clerk;
Brainworm, the wise man: Wellbred.
a gay young fellow of the time: Justice
Clement, who hates to convict, and
Knowell. the overwlee.
Tho leading part of Bobadil, made
famous by the fact that Shakespeare
took this part in the first production,
will be played by John Bor.nell. Kijely.
the jealous old merchant played with
such success by David Garrick. will be
taken by R. G. Barnett; P. C. Edwards
will be Cob; A. L. Trowbridge. Knowell;
and R. H. Baker. Brainworm. Unfor
tunately there Ik not a great deal for
women to do in this play. Miss Claire
Pedlar. Â«ho recently played Lvdia
Languish in 'The Rivals." will act the
part of Dame Kitely. the merchant's
wife. As Mistress Bridsrett. Mho be
comes the wife of Knowell. Miss Jeral
dine Brown has slight rhanre to show
what she is able to do. Miss Eliza
beth Buckingham has the star woman's
part as Tib. the wife of Cob. the water
carrier, who is the victim of many
severe beatings by her irate husband.
There are many minor parts taken by
student actors.

ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 24. â All
the members of the imperial family
who attended the requiem for Grand
Duke Sergius at Tsarskoe-tfelo re

restraints which were advised by the
police for her safety, rebelled against
the alleged necessity of remaining at

SENATE COMMITTEE AMENDS

Archipelago, Except for Med

WASHINGTON, Feb. 23.â The Sen
ate Committee on the Philippines to
day authorized a favorable report on
the House bill revising and amending
the tariff laws of the Philippine isl
ands. Only one amendment was nÂ»ade
to the bill as it passed the House The
provision providing a license system
with a view to deriving revenue from
traffic in opium has been stricken out.
In its place has been substitut3d a
provision that after March 1, 1908, :t
shall be unlawful to import into the
Philippine Islands opium, in whatever
form, except by the Government and
for medicinal purposes only, and at no
time shall it be lawful to sell opium
to any native of the Philippine Isl

WASHINGTON, Feb. 23. â The con

amendment regarded as most import

must evacuate Manchuria, regardless
of the outcome of the war.
If Japan and Russia should
conclude peace on the basis
that either nation retain the whole or
a part of Manchuria the situation
would be embarrassing to all the
peace powers, and especially to Sec
retary Hay. He then would be com
pelled to back down entirely or call
upon the other powers to carry out
their agreement, which might mean
war.
One thing is apparent: Whatever j
the outcome of the war, the integrity ;
of China is menaced. Japan, having â 
twice captured Port Arthur, will not
be disposed to surrender that strong
hold fnr the second time, and the faci j
that she named as one of the terms
of peace the cession of all the Llao- i
tunsr Peninsula indicates that she "in- â 
tends to hold at least part of the cap
tured territory. That which Secretary j
Hay scught to prevent Russia accom
plishing â the practical annexation of
the whole or a part of Manchuria â may
he achieved by Japan. In }.he role of
conqueror the Mikado's Government
threatens- to carry out the programme
which, With Russia as the aggressor,
raised such a storm of protest on the
part of the neutral nations.
Just how Great Britain, Germany
and France would regard a peace set

both Japan and Russia large slices of
Chinese soil, remains to be seen. It
is likely that Germany and France
would h&ve a finger in the pie. It has
been apparent since the war was be
gun that some understanding exists
between the Kaiser and Czar; and
Prance, as the ally of Russia, would
rot be overlooked.
In an Interview to-aay Count Cas
sini, the Russian Embassador, said
talk of peace was never more absurd
than now. The Embassador has had
positive information from the very
highest officials in St. Petersburg that
the war will be prosecuted with in
creased vigor. It is expected that Gen
eral Kuropatkin, with the opening of
the spring campaign, will accomplish
much, in view of the reinforcements he
has received. The Emperor has every
confidence In his military ability.

RICH CONTRACTS l\ SIGHT.
Americans May Aid in Rebuilding the
Navy of Russia.
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 24. â St.
Petersburg is the Mecca at present
of representatives of ship-builders of
various nationalities who have been
attracted hither by the prospect of
rich contracts in connection with the
rebuilding of the navy and the in
crease of the volunteer fleet. Then*
are good prospects of American cap
ital getting a good share of the con
tracts to be awarded, but up to the
present time the only contract let has

ATHENIAN CLUB

initial number.
As the Athenian Club committee promised, :
there was "something doing" from the start
at 6:36 p. m. until the finish at â but never
mind the finith. There was music, both suf-

Their Work Will
Be Greatest in
Years.
OAKLAND, Feb. 23.â The first serv
ice in preparation for the great evan
gelistic campaign to be held in Oak
land. March 5 to 19, was held at the
First Presbyterian Church this even
ing, when Rev. R. A. Walton. D. D.,
addressed the ushers and assistants,
who are to be the principal workers in
the great evangelistic services. At
this early date some 350 workers have
been selected and more will be se
cured by next week. Dr. Walton said:
The success of those meetings will depend
very largely upon the faithfulness, tact and
earnestness of the ushers and their assistants.
Not only will it be necessary for you to attend
the services in the five places appointed or the
principal meeting?, but you must be prepared
at a moment's notice to report at any place
designated for overflow meetings. \lt will be
nece**ary for the ashen to . make themselves
familiar with the seating arrangement In the
churches near their center and in the down
town districts, the theaters also, as the mo
ment the doors are open for overflow meetings
the people will rush In with such a Jam that
there will be no time to get the situation in
hand if you are not then familiar with it.
The assistants are really more the assistants
. ! the evangelists than of' the ushers, and will
be directed by them through the chief usher
of the district.
Dr. Walton will begin his work at
the Eighth Avenue Methodist Church
on next Monday evening, which is a
week in advance of the other evange
lists. The meetings will be conducted
on Monday, Tuesday. Wednesday and
Thursday evenings. There will be no
service on Friday evening, as all the
churches of Oakland will unite in the
rriass meeting at the First Congrega
tional Church to hear Rev. Robert
Coyle of Denver tell of the evange
listic campaign conducted in that city
so successfully by the evangelists who
are to work in Oakland. At this serv
ice there will be a large chorus choir
composed of members of all of the five
great choruses from the districts.
These will probably be directed by
O. F. Pugh, the chorister and soloist
working with Dr. Walton in the Eighth
Avenue district. Mr. Pugh is a noted
Welsh tenor. He is now in the city
with his family at the Albany.
Rev. Henry Ostrom, evangelist, and
J. P. Hillis, chorister and soloist,
are now engaged in work in Alameda.

PILOT AT SEA
IN LAW COURT
Witness Stand Is No Bridge
and Gallant Old Salt Is
Nearly J ridged in Contempt
REFUSES TO ANSWER
lie Declares Query Touches
Memory of Dead Friend
and Koars at the Attorney
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway. Feb. 23.
Captain George D. Korts of the San
j Francisco pilot service was on the
! witness stand here to-day to tell of the
I strang-e change of mind that came over
[ his old friend, Captain Leroy Fletcher,
I over whose will a contest ie being
I waged. Koris came near being judged
! guilty of contempt for the refusal to
:<r?\ver a pertinent question, which the
old captain thought reflected on the
I character of his dead friend.
Captain Korts is a veritable son ot
Ola Neptune. His sea legs are much
bowed by the rolling vof uncertain
craft. He could ill : brook the probing
of young Attorney Ryker and in his
first outburst, addressing himself as
though from the bridge of his ship,
ho said, "Young man, are you trying
to make me out a liar? If that's your
game you have gone up against the
wrong man."
A little later Ryker, wished to know
if Korts had told of everything upon
which he based his . opinion that
Fletcher was insane.
"Everything but an incident be
tween myself and the captain," , wai
the reply. .
The examination proceeded thus:
Q. â Well, what was It?
A. â will not tell unless the court makes
me.
Judge Captain, this court and Jury
is entitled to know everything upon which you
base your opinion and I shall have to direct
you to answer the question. â ' â¢ ' .
Captain Korts â Even if it traduces the name
of a dead man?
Judge Ogden â Yes, if the attorney insists
upon the question.
Captain Korts â Toung man, do you insist
upon my answering that question?
Attorney. Ryker â I want to know what you
base your Judgment on. ; . -
Captain Korts â You are base. base. Well, I
will not tell.
Judge Ogdenâ Captain, you are going to put
me in a very unpleasant position If you do
not answer.
Captain Korts â Well, exclude that woman
from the room and 'I will tell. /
Judge Ogdenâ Yes, we can do that. -.
The woman having hurriedly dis
appeared, Captain Korts once again
asked if he must answer the question,
and when it was insisted upon said;
"Sitting in the pilot office one day
Captain Fletcher asked me to take
him to have a good time."
"Was that all?" asked the attorney.
"Coming from him to me I consid
ered that an insane man's question,"
the captain replied.
- The bubble had suddenly burst, the
air of expectancy subsided as suddenly
as it had arisen and the captain was
excused. . .

CHINESE COME
TO UNIVERSITY
Seven Students, Proteges of
the Great Prince Sheng,
Now at Seat of Learning
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, Feb. 23.
Seven Chinese students, each a
protege of the great Chinese Prince,
Sheng Kung Pao, arrived at the uni
versity from the Orient yesterday to
begin courses of study that are ex
pected to fit them for important of
fices in the departments of the Chi
nese Government controlled by Sheng.
The Chinese Prince, deemed by
wise observers to be the most power
ful and influential personage in China,
has arranged for five scholarships of
$350 each, to be paid to five Chinese
students now in the university. He
is sending the seven new arrivals,
however, to be instructed here, in ad
dition to his scholarship benefaction.
The seven men are all graduates of
the Nanyang Government College at
Shanghai, where they have had a
full course of training under English
and American teachers. They come
now to California to receive advanced
instruction in branches that are only
partly familiar to them.
Mr. Wu, the leader of the party, has
had several years' experience as a
teacher in the Nanyang college and in
St. John's College at Shanghai. He
is to enter the college of commerce
here, making banking systems his
specialty. Three others of the Chi
nese students will study commercial
ideas. Mr. Teng will make chemistry
his principal study, Mr. Tv natural
science, and Mr. Chao mining.
The students are all Hsiu-tsal's, or
graduates of the first rank in Chinese
literature, with the exception of one,
who has the next highest degree, of
Chujen.

HIS NEPHEWS
THE BURGLARS
Grocer, a Victim of Thefts,
Traps His Own Relatives
by a Clever Contrivance
WOBKS BELL AND LIGHT
Keeps Vigil Over Store and
Is Rewarded After Two
Weeks of Watch by Night
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1016 Broadway, Feb. Zi.
J. W. Reed, a grocer at 1012 Clay
street, set a trap for burglars and bag
ged a pair of them in the shop early
this morning. To his amazement the
captured birds of night proved to be
Reed's nephews, Jesse and Lloyd Rus
sell, 26 and 21 years ' old, respectively.
The brothers were sent to the City
Prison. The uncle has not decided
whether he will prosecute the young
men.
Tho pair were caught by the success
ful operation of clever mechanical con
trivances which Reed employed to trap
the thieves, who 4ft months had been
helping themselves to hla money and
goods. The cash drawer in the office
had been the objective point of attack.
Money left in the till disappeared over
night with regularity. The grocer with
some ingenuity fixed up his trap. He
connected the rear basement door of
the store with an electric attachment.
Upon the opening of the door this ap
paratus would start a bell ringing in
a small room over the rear of the
store where Reed kept vigil after busi
ness hours. To that hiding place was
also run an electrical connection to all
of the lights in the store. By a pulley
device Reed could turn on the lights
without leaving his place of conceal
ment.
After waiting patiently for two
weeks Reed was aroused soon after 2
o'clock this morning by the burr-r-r-r
of the bell. The awakened shopkeeper
grabbed his pistol, set the lights going
and rushed to the store. He had
startled the two men, whom he plainly
saw standing among the pile's of
groceries, evidently alarmed by the
sudden flare of lights.
Reed fired two "Shots at the intruders,
who ran to the basement, trying to es
cape by the rear door through which
they had entered. But the grocer
headed off the trapped men and as they
started to run up the back stairs he
covered them with his pistol, shouting:
"Don't come up here or I'll kill you
both."
"Don't shoot." came the plea from
the cornered pair. "Don't shoot; we
will not move."
"Hold up your hands and go up
stairs into the store." demanded the de
termined grocer. The brothers obeyed
orders. Reed entered the warerooms
and telephoned to the police, all the
while keeping his prisoners under range
of the pistol. Captain of Police W. J.
Petersen and Patrolman Walters hur
ried to the grocery and quickly re
lieved Reed of his captives. The grocer
did not recognize his nephews until one
of them addressed him as "uncle" after
the police arrived.
At the City Prieon skeleton keys were
found on Jesse Russell. He has been
in trouble with the police before. In
1899 Russell was arrested on a charge
of selling a horse and buggy he had
hired from Gates' stable. Russell was
freed on a writ of habeas corpus.
Lloyd Russell had been in his uncle's
employ but was dscharged some time
ago. He was familiar with the store
and his uncle's business routine.
The thefts at Reed's had been in
vestigated by the detectives for weeks.
They reported that the. burglaries were
undoubtedly committed by some one
who well knew the ins and outs of
the place. In police parlance they were
"inside" jobs.

We stand In Oakland for the building up
of a great city. We believe that the Re
publican party has carried and will continue
to carry the banner of progress.
We believe In safe, honest, broad-gauged
administration of municipal affairs.
Such an administration means development,
commercially, industrially and socially. An
aggressive and progressive handling ot munici
pa! affairs means growth. Population follows
in the wake of good government. They pay
/for it and 1 stand for it. Good government
not only means the just interpretation and
execution of law. but the enactment of good
and wholesome ltws and the proper admin
istering- of all the functions of the municipal
curporation. It also means the proper use ot
the municipal powers along the lines of what
Is called the higher objects* of government,
such as the beautifying of the city. Oakland
la essentially a show city. We should con
stantly strive to put on and keep on our best
dress. We have already neglected too long
th'^ opportunity for making our city more at
tractive.

Ladies as to Proposed Laws
CLEAN STREETS DESIRED
Legislator Explains Impossi
bility of Getting Action
During the Present Session
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
Jl4B Center street, Feb. .;i.
The ladies of the Town and Gown
Club, who had hoped by acting in
concert with the Improvement Clubs
of Berkeley to procure legislation at
Sacramento which would insure clean
streets In the university town, and in
every other city of the State as well.
are doomed to disappointment. Their
plan must wait for fulfillment until
another session of the Legislature, ac
cording to Assemblyman W. H. Waste
of Berkeley, who has sent information
â¢ to this effect to Mrs. Charles R. Breck.
chairman of the civic section of the
Town and Gown Club. *
Assemblyman Wastes letttr is as
follows:
Dear Mrs. Breck: Permit mÂ« to acknowl
edge through you thÂ« receipt of thÂ» resolution,
adopted at a mass meeting of the citizens M
Berkeley held in the interest of clean streets.
1 have just received the resolution and regrÂ»l
that the matter did nut reach me sooner. 'Co
day is the last day under the law on which
bills' may be Introduced in thÂ« legislature
without the consent of wo-thirds of the mem
bers, had on roll call. Only them* bills will
hereafter be allowed to be Introduced which
present urgent features or which relate to
matters pertaining to the State government.
All bills alter to-day must first be referred
to a committee on introduction of bills and
the report or that committee Is practically
final. .
In view of this situation, it will, In my
judgment, be an utter impossibility tor any
thing to be done at this session of the Legis
lature. A bill giving municipalities the power
to keep the streets clean and to levy a. special
tax and- lien upon the abutting property as
suggested In your resolution must provide a
complete proceeding and should not only be
well considered but carefully drawn, other
wise the bill would not stand a teat in court.
It would be a meaaurt providing for taking
property under penalty and. must not contra
vene the constitutional requirement that prop
erty cannot be taken without due process of
law. r â¢ :â â â â â â  -â ..â â¢â¢â 
in order to ascertain the sentiment of some
of the leading lawyers in the Senate and the
Assembly In regard to the matter, I hastily
submitted the proposition to a number of the
members of the Judiciary Committee of each
house. They all agreed that It would be im
possible, without knowledge of th* like stat
utes now In force In the Eastern States, to
1 draft a bill in such short time. Knowing the
general sentiment 'of the property owners .In
California in relation to the . care of streets
by city authorities, It would be unwise to at
tempt any legislation at this late day. as a
hastily drawn measure would certainly Invite
opposition and possible defeat.
It would be very wise, in my opinion, that
the clubs represented on the petition which
has been forwarded to me form a legislative
committee with Instructions to the committee
to have prepared before the next meeting of
the Â» Legislature a complete measure bearing
! on this subject.' If the bill is ready to Intro
j duce at the opening of the next session I be
lieve " that a determined effort in its behalf
j would secure its passage. . â 
* I regret that the matter did not rea^h me in
time : for at least an attempt to be made 'to
! do something this session. ; I ' assure . you at
I my interest in matters of this kind and will
be pleased, if the occasion should require, to
give any committee you appoint the benefit
of my experience in legislative matters -Very
truly yours. . WILLIAM H. WASTE.

ANDREWS THREATENED
BY LETTER-WRITERS
Dark Warnings Sent
to Foreman of the
Grand Jury.
GRIM warnings have no dread for Foreman Andrews,
though the malls bring them almost daily from miser
able writers who sign no name. Threats of violence
because of the Grand Jury's activities against vice and
wrongdoing continue to be made anonymously despite tre
attitude of indifference on the part of the Inquisitorial
body's leading factor. He regards them lightly -and for
weeks has divulged to no one that cowardly attempts to deter
his work were being made persistently. On the other hand
the foreman has received many letters offering encourage
ment and even financial aid to prosecute the Grand Jury's
work. Andrews says $20,000 would be available within a
week trom public donation if the money were needed.
Thomas P. Andrews, foreman of the
Grand Jury, Is a target nowadays for
the anonymous letter "writer. His en
ergetic efforts to ferret out the wrong
doer have brought upon his head a de
luge of cowardly threats to do him
violence. The letters began coming
several weeks affo â 6ome in script that
was miserable, others indicating a
defter ,hand. A few were of grim
import and told of dark streets to be
avoided. There has been a deluge of
denunciation, both as to personal char
acter and public acts.
No one worries less about the shud
dery missives than does the foreman
himself. He laughs heartily whenever
they are discussed. â¢"Oh. they were
written by some Irresponsible cranks
or by the hangers-on about the dens
of vice that we have raided," says An
drews when it is suggested that the
letters ought not be treated too lightly.
Even the other members of the
Grand Jury have not been told of the
contents of the anonymous missives.
The foreman refuses absolutely to let
any one see them. "Too insignificant
a matter," he declares. He is preserv
ing them, however, and when the
Grand Jury and its work shall have
gone into oblivion he will make up a
scrapbook of the choicest ones for the
entertainment of his friends.
Xo attempt has been made to trace
down the writers of the letters. This
Is because Andrews has kept his own
counsel and ignored the threats. Had
he submitted the matter to his col
leagues they would undoubtedly have
taken tome action. It is only recent
ly that Andrews has divulged the fact
that he was being threatened.
TREATS LETTERS LJGHTT/T.
"Owing to my position at the head
of the inquisitorial body," explained
the foreman yesterday, "my name has
appeared more frequently In the pub
lic prints thaa that of any other mem
ber. It has looked possibly as if I
was doing all the aggressive work. Of
course, a Grand Jury is calculated to
stir animosities in its work of hunt
ing out evil-doers. Slander and threats
are to be expected.
I have all along treated these
anonymous communications as a huge
jcke. It would belittle me to give them
OUt for publication. The truth is that
we have been receiving so many
anonymous Â« letters here that we are
jrfciting tired of them and many go into
the waste basket without being read.
"1 am not to be frightened out of doing
my duty as long as lam foreman of the
Grand Jury. But all these letters I
have received are of so foolish a char
acter that I would not ascribe to them
the dignity of being an effort to de
ter me*
"The only unpleasant experience I
have had thus far with a crowd
of saloon bums, and they didn't worry
me at all. One evening during the raid
ing season I was standing in front of
1129 Dupont street. Lieutenant Conboy
of the Police Department was with me.
Evidently word had been passed into
a near-by saloon, for presently a gang
came out to the sidewalk, and they
muttered and pointed their fingers at
me. Their voices grew louder, and I
could hear epithets, directed probably
at me.
"I was feeling: rather brisk that
evening and was perfectly willing to
go a round with any of those fellows.
The gang seemed to come to the same
conclusion, for it became less boister
ous, gradually subsided and finally
withdrew into the 6aioon."
OFFER FIN'AXCIAJL AID.
All the letters that are received at
the Grand Jury rooms are not of a
fearsome nature, however. On the con
trary, citizens have not been remiss in
encouraging the public inquisitors in
their work. Many missives express
hearty commendation. The number of
such communications heap up evidence
of a widespread interest In the efforts
of the Grand Jury. The campaign
against places of vice, particularly 620
Jackson street and 1129 Dupont street,
haa brought forth hundreds of letters
of approval.
The words of encouragement are
backed up in many instances with of
fers of financial aid. Many have writ
ten that they would be glad to con
tribute to. a fund for Grand Jury ex
penses if money is needed. Thus far
the inquisitors have not been hindered
by want of funds. All that has been
needed has been available from the
city treasury through the court orders
of Judge Liawlor.
"We have not had occasion to accept
any of these offers," said Foreman An
drews yesterday. "Despite Mayor
Schmitz's protestations I do not under
stand that the Grand Jury has been
shut off from funds in the municipal
treasury. Judge Lawlor and Auditor
Baehr will continue to pass our de
mands for expense money.
"But if we were in need of funds I
am assured that we could raise $20,000
in a week's time from public subscrip
tions to carry on our investigations. It
would surprise you to know how many
offers of financial assistance we have
received from people who want to help
us if we are cramped by a shortage of
money. But I do not think It would
be good policy to accept the offers.
The provision made by law Is the prop
er source of Grand Jury funds. No
question can then be raised as to out
side Influences."
The Grand Jury â¢will meet this aft
ernoon at 2 o'clock In its Mills build
ing quarters. The report of Architect
Newton J. Than?, who has inspected
all the theaters and showhouses of the
city, will be ready for presentation.
Hardly any of them were found to
comply with the fire ordinances, and
at least one is regarded as a flretrap.
It Is possible that drastic measures will
be advteed in some Instances.
Morris Levy, secretary to the Board
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 24, 1905.
of Public Works, yesterday turned
over to Foreman Andrews the $100 that
he has kept on hand for over a year
without warrant of law, the Grand
JuryÂ» says. It was paid to him as a
deposit for the purchase of Confiscated
property at the "corporation yard,"
but forfeited by the man who came to
the conclusion that he had made a bad
bargain. Levy will resign his position
on March 1, having made announce
ment to this effect some time ago.
BYINGTON ANSWERS SUITS.
Alleges That Violation of Resort Or-
dinances Justifies Police Raids.
Diatrict Attorney Byington filed his
answer yesterday on behalf of the Po
lice Department, Grand Jury and
Sheriff, defendants m^the suit brought
by Elysa Malenolre and seven other
proprietresses of houses on Belden
place for an injunction restraining
raids upon their resorts. He declares
that the houses in Question are used
for evil purposes and are a menace to
the peace and good morals of the
neighborhood. Arrests, he asserts,
are being made pursuant to warrants,
of persons actually inmates or patrons
of the resorts.
Mr. Byington also filed answers to
the suits of Sebastian Ravani and Ed
ward Moran, which resulted in the
temporary stoppage of police raids at
620 Jackson street.
CRASHES THROUGH THE ICE.
Mr. Triplett confined to his bed with
pneumonia owing to an unexpected
plunge in the lake. It was thought at
first that his own weight was respon
sible for the ice breaking, but an in
vestigation of the matter disclosed the
fact that his small nephews had pur
posely weakened a certain portion of
the pond and then decoyed their un
suspecting uncle to the spot. Realistic
\lews can be seen in next Sunday's
comic.
REPORT ABOUT
WAR IN WINES
Shareholders Hear of What
California Association Has
Done During a Year
The shareholders of the California
Wine Association have received a re
port of the management, from which
it appears that the assets amount to
$7,997,589. The items include wines in
ventoried at $2,561,716 74; bills and ac
counts receivable, $1,142,784 20; stock
In other companies, $2,503,241; real es
tate, plant, machinery, etc., $1,721,122;
cash in banks, $42,667 33. Among the
liabilities are the capital stock of
$-i,054,200; special reserve against fur
ther sweet wine competition, $250,000;
bills payable, J2, 464, 680 24; outstanding
srape and wine accounts not due or
discountable, $182,587 40.
The matter of most general Interest
contained in the report relates to the
competition in eweet wines ana means
that the association took in this re
gard. Some paragraphs are as follows:
There was Inaugurated durlnf the year what
rr.'.eht fairly be characterized as a senseless
and most unnecessary cutting of price la
sweet wines and brandies by to-called Inde
pendents, principally vineyard proprietors and
wine-makers who. rendered prosperous by the
sheltering influence of your association's opera
tions, hoped thereby to extend their relations
with the general trade to the detriment of
the large distributors, little realizing that
while it Is easy to break prices It Is difficult
afterward to re-establish them.
Tour association refrained. In common with
other large wine houses, for several months
from lowering their price list to meet this
competition, until Inroads into their sweet
wine business became so serious that they
were forced to act, and in the early fall the
breaking of minimum sweet wine and brandy
prices became quite general, though your as
sociation has been able to maintain thÂ« list
on hich grade wir.es and standard brandies.
The upholding of conditions for all con
cerned, including grapegrowers. has thus been
rendered duncult by the action of people who,
having much at stake in the maintenance of
their vineyard values, should hare beÂ«n the
more loth to precipitate a breaking up of the
favorable auspices for all concerned, which
for several years have been created and main
tained through the Influence of your associa
tion.
Fortunately your directors, through a settled
policy of keeping down the book values of
wines to low nirures. have for several years
beeirfreparing against such a contingency, and
now find matters in excellent shape to meet
the Issue.
A new move was also reported as
follows:
Tour management realizes that It must en
deavor to minimize such fluctuations in the
amount of annual profits by the firmer estab
lishment of special brands, and to this end
plcns are being forwarded to bring closer to
the notice of the public the excellence of Cali
fornia wines by bottling and distributing the
better varieties In a manner which has hith
erto not been exploited. With the prestige
which such a campaign of publicity should
glvo the wholesale customers of your asso
ciation will doubtless find It greatly to their
advantage to closely patronize Its wines Instead
of purchasing, on the encouragement of a few
cents less per gallon, the immature and
roughly handled wines of those whose equip
ment and capital limitations render their
turning out of a finished article uncertain If
not Impossible.
For directory the following were se
lected: I. W. Hellman, J. W. Hellman
Jr., Percy Morgan, Daniel Meyer, Hen
ry Rosenfeld, E. Frowenfeld, J. J.
Jacobi, C. Schilling, P. C. Rossi, W.
Hansen and J. Frowenfeld. It was
voted to reduce the monthly dividends
from 60 to 42 dents.

fied before the investigating committee
that he had been handed a number of

names are being withheld by the com
mittee.
"I have known O. A. Baker for sev
eral years," said Hamilton. "I helped
elect him joint Senator from our dis
trict. I have known that this thing
has been going on for some weeks. O.
A. Baker has given me letters to mem
bers of the House with their names
written on them, and asked to see that
they were delivered. I know that these
letters reached the Representatives and
have given the special committee the
name of the page who delivered them.
I know that these men made speeches
against the anti-cigarette bill.'
"How many Representatives were
sent envelopes In this manner," he was
asked.
"I won't say."
"Eight or ten?"
"No, not that many."
The County Grand Jury will take up
the bribery case.

MayÂ«T Sehmiti yesterday made pub

lon Commissioners Roberts, De-
L^flingwell, Ma^uire and Voor

ly held. The Mayor declares the Cor
ns not guilty of the charges as
tiled. The decision says:
Having investigated all the conduct and
acts of said defendants and each of them as
tuch Election Commissioners and as compos
ing such Board of Election Commissioners of
tAin city and county in the conduct and man
agement of and in the appointment of pre
circt election officers for said primary elec
tion, . nd the law and facts being by me, as
rack Mayor, considered. I do hereby, as such
Mayor, by virtue of the power reposed In m*
l>v the charter of said city and county, de-
I rif- and find that the Bald defendants and
rtuch of them are not guilty of any of the
â¢ t srsrr-s co made and filed herein as aforesaid
end are not guilty of any misconduct in the
f-or.duct or management of or in appointing
pndact election officers for said primary elec

them are hereby acquitted upon each and all
<>: said charges aforesaid and of any miscon
duct as euch Election Commissioners or as
composing said Board of Election Commls
f loners in the conduct and management of
or In the appointment of precinct election
officers for f&id primary election.
Accompanying the finding? was the
following communication addressed to
the Election Commissioners:
I, Ff-b. 23. 1905
To the Board of Ejection Commissioners:
I have this day decided in your favor the
charge* brought against you involving the
conduct of the last primary election. I have
done co beoaufÂ« I find that in appointing the
election officers from the larce list of ap
j-.k-auts you have followed the usual customs
and practice prevailing in your department
under successive administrations for many
fail past and because I believe each and all
Â©i you to have been honest a.nd sincere in the
discharge of your official duties. Moreover,
1 agree with you and with all of your pre
d*-cessors in office that the property qualifica
tion required of election officers is in conflict
with th* constitution of the State and there
fore void.
At the came time I wiÂ»h to call your
esrnrpi attention to the absolute necessity of
exeiclslng the most searching care and caution
lv the beleotion of vucli election officers and
In the conduct of every election, primary as
well as general. The entire fabric of our
Government and the fundamental principles
of this republic must rest eventually on th"
parity- of our elections and I urge upon each
and all of you hereafter to exercise personal
end individual supervision over the selection
of all boards off election.
While the cases of Wyman and Bteffens
were before the trial courts I refrained from
making any official comment, because, know
ing nothing personally of the facts of their
cased, and believing In th* principle that
every defendant i* entitled to a fair trial, I
did not wish to say anything which might
prejudice their legal rights, notwithstanding
the Intense provocation to do otherwise 'arising
from the malicious falsehoods dally published
by the corrupt and corrupting editors of th*
chronicle and Bulletin, newspapers of this
city. In their vain attempt to connect the city
administration with those alleged frauds upon
the ballot. The administration had no Interest
â whatever in the last primary election other
than the Interest every good citizen should
have In protecting the Integrity of elections
snd never did and never will connive at bal
lot box stuffing or at any other crime against
the electoral franchise.
There is no offense more despicable, more
â¢Jeplorabls or more far-reaching in Its evil
results, none which tends iaorÂ« to sap the
vitalijy of our Institutions, and none which I,
as Mayor or . the city, will do more to prevent.
I shall therefore demand that In the appoint*
tnent of your next election boards and in the
conduct of election*, you shall take every
possible precaution , to prevent the occurrence
of such crimes as thosÂ» with which Wyman
and Steffens are charged.
I recognize that It may be Impossible to
have an election theoretically perfect, but as
lons as this administration shall remain In
power it should bÂ« our distinct and definite
aim and purpose to make our â¢'lections as
nearly perfect and as clean as human fore
sight and human power can possibly render
them, and we must all earnestly' co-operate
to that end.
I have deemed it proper on the occasion of
my dlsmlwlor the chanres against you to irlve
you my views on these matters, and I trust
Xf)fy will receive your matt rÂ»rÂ»fnl ~m.M.._

PHOTO BRIDALS
ARE ILLEGAL
Commissioner Sargent Rules
That Marriages by Picture
Have No Validity Here
"Photograph marriages" in Japan
and their validity in this country were
the subject of an opinion handed down
yesterdsy by Frank P. Sargent. Com
missioner General of Immigration.
There is a touching Japanese custom
which permits a Japanese subject in a
foreign country to send his photograph
to his fiancee in Japan and have tha
picture married to the girl in the pres
ence of witnesses. Many such photo
graph wives have rome to this port
seeking the huebands they have never
seen. The United States Immigrant of
ficials at this port have always re
quired the parties to bÂ« remarried in
this country before allowing the virgin
brides to land.
Superior Judge Carroll Cook handed
down a decision recently to the effect
that such photograph marriages, al
though recognized in Japan as legal,
are not legal under the laws of the
United States, because the husband
domiciled here is under the jurisdic
tion of the United States and may not
get married while he remains here ex
cept in aocordanc* with the laws of
the Stats in which he may be a resi
dent. Another reason is that such
photograph marriages have not been
consummated. Mr. Sargent follows in
nearly the same line of reasoning.
TEAMSTERS CRITICIZE
CORNELIUS' ACTIONB
Say Stand Taken by Labor Loader In
New Concern Is Opposed to
Union Principles.
The Joint executive council of tha
Teamsters' Union met last Monday
night and after a long conference ad
dressed communications to the Labor
Council and the Carmen's Union de
nouncing Richard Cornelius, president
of the latter union, for the stand he
has taken in the Workinfimen's Co
operative Commercial Company. The
teamsters say that Cornelius 1 move Js
directly In opposition to organized la
bor.
The teamsters declare that under
no circumstances will they lend their
aid to Cornelius and that they are in
no way affiliated with the scheme.
They say his actions are not in keep
ing with the principles of unionism
and that organized labor is liable to
suffer a serious setback through the
actions of the head of the Carmen's
Union.
The teamsters, after an investiga
tion, expressed their sympathy for the
members of the Milk Drivers' Union
and exonerated them from all
charges of standing in with the trust.
So far as the teamsters can determine
no milk trust exists.

BRITISH BOXER
TO FIGHT HERE
Lively Bouts Expected at
Hawthorne Club's Month
ly Exhibition To-Night
The flght fans who journey to Wood
ward's pavilion to-night will enjoy the
opportunity of seeing Jack McLauehlin,
who is hailed as the champion amateur
welterweight of Great Britain, match
his skill and hitting prowess with Joe
Thomas, the pride of the Brooklyn
Club and one of the best boys of his
class in the State. They are to furnish
the main event of the Hawthorne Club's
monthly exhibition.
McLaughlin helped condition Kid
Lavigne when the latter fought Burge
in England some years ago. He comes
with the reputation of being a fighting
fiend and should he defeat Thomas he
will issue a sweeping challenge to all
welters of the State. Thomas* ability
is well known here, and McLauehlin
will have to do some fast work in order
to lower the colors of the Californian.
Jack Murray, the champion bantam
amateur of New York, will be pitted
against Harry Tenny, the hard hitting
Southside wonder, in one of the special
events. Murray Is clever while his
opponent is a rusher and therefore this
mill should be worth viewing.
Low Powell takes on Gus Salisbury In
thp other special match. The latter has
been victorious in nearly all his con
tests, but in Powell he meets a lad who
has a punch as well as a block. Bob
Cairns and Nobby Otts, brother of Billy
Otts, are billed to meet.
The other events are all good ones.
Pete Sullivan and Joe Ward, two lierht
heavies, will meet in one. While George
Sanfranson and Young Dempsey are
billed in the other. Jere Dunn and
Young Mitchell will act as Judges, while
Eddie Smith, the popular Oakland
referee, will officiate.
SAM BERGER AGREES
TO FIGHT JOES LONG
Heavyweights Will Meet Before the
Bay City Club on Next
Friday Night.
Sam Berger signed with Sol Levin
son of the Bay City Club last night
for a go with big Joe Long at Wood
ward's pavilion next Friday night.
This means that his negotiations with
Rickards of Chicago are off for the
time being at least. Berger will start
to train at the beach immediately.
Long went over to Larkspur yester
day and promises to be in good eon
ditlon for the bout.
Long has always been considered a
formidable opponent for Berger and
tried hard to get a match with the
former Olympian. Long is a man with
a punch and in condition should give
a good account of himself. He never
trained for a flght before and his
friends say that if he manages to get
into shape he will give Berger the
hardest fight the latter ever had.
The Supervisors' Police Committee
did not meet yesterday, so the boxing
permit for March is still in abeyance.
E. R. Folger Wins Golf Trophy.
OAKLAND, Feb. 23.â A golf tour
nament was *ield yesterday on the
links of the Claremont Country Club
and first prize was won by E. R. Fol
ger. George E. de Golia of this city
and Mr. Adamson of San Francisco
tied for second place. Those who took
part in the tournament were:
W. P. Johnson, E. R. Folgrer. G. A. Whea
ton, Rev. E. E. Baker, Professor C. M. Gay
ley, F. B. Btratton, J. H. Ames, A. I* Higgins
Mr. Adamson, J. O. Cadnian, H. S. Sher
wood, Frank Kales. Carleton Curtis, O. E, d*
Oolla, Dr. A. M. Carpenter.
The sporting men who are known to
be good Judges of prices on boxing
bouts are being besieged these days for
their opinion as to the betting on the
CoTbett-Nelson bout. The general im
pression is that considerable coin will
be wagered at even money. As usual
in such cases the volume of money in
the market is expected to make itself
after the first day when the price will
settle down.
It is expected the heavy bettors will
string again with Corbett, while those
of smaller means will be seeking the
Nelson end of the betting. Corbett has
lived and trained for two months in a
rational manner and if he still has a
fight in him this is the time it should
be brought out.
He has had the good fortune to have
Joe Gans interest himself in his train
ing, and the Baltimore wonder is work
ing as hard as though it was his own
fight.
The closing of the race track for the
day, coupled with the pleasant
weather, attracted a large crowd of
sporting men to Billy Shannon's villa
to get a line on the form shown by
Young Corbett.
The little Denverite was feeling in
the mood for- working and he went
through his paces with a will. The
cozy gymnasium was extremely warm,
and before Corbett donned the gloves
the perspiration was rolling from him.
The work was of the hardest kind and
he scarcely paused to take a breathing
spell. A four-roud bout with Joe Gans
followed and the mill was certainly
fierce.
Trainer Frank McDonald, as usual,
had to caution his protege about
roughing it. The spectators enjoyed
the bout immensely.
If Corbett is successful in his com
ing battle Joe Oans will stay on tho
coast and will help prepare him for
the proposed battle with Britt. If Cor
bett loses Gans will return to Balti
more and will fight Willie LÂ«wls on
March 20.
Al Herford is spending much time
at Shannon's keeping a close tab an
Corbett's condition. Herford is keep-
Ing many Eastern bettors posted on
the little Denverite's condition. Among
them are George Considine. Honest John
Kelly, Dick Bernard, Bab Deady of
Philadelphia, M. J. Herford and Jim
O'Hara of Baltimore, Big John Nelson
of Washington and Buck Connolly of
Pittsburg.
The many flght fans and friends of
Battling Nelson who visited Smiling
Metzner's Tavern at Larkspur yester
day to watch the Dane go through his
training work were sorely disappoint
ed, as Bat changed his programme and
dispensed with gymnasium exercise for
the day.
Bat has hardly missed a day in the
gymnasium during this siege of train
ing and Manager Billy Nolan thought
a day off would do his protege good.
In the morning Bat, Billy Nolan,
Fred Landers and "Rawhide" Kelly
donned their road attire and took a
long tramp around the up^er bay.
Point San Quentin was reached at
noon, where the boys enjoyed a hearty
luncheon. An inspection of the prison
followed. Bat concluded he would
rather board at Metzner's. He was
promptly seconded by "Rawhide," who
didn't like the institution at all.
At 3 p. m. the party started for
camp and forty-eight minutes later
Nelson, closely followed by Landers,
with "Rawhide" a bad third, dashed
into the tavern. When the boys were
sighted by the large crowd at the quar
ters the cry went up, "Here he comes."
Bat was given a brisk rubdown and
chatted with friends fully half an hour
before Billy Nolan, looking rather
weary, arrived on the scene.
Nelson^ after his rubdown, looked the
picture of health. His skin glowed, his
eyes sparkled and the lightness of his
step clearly demonstrated his fine con
dition. Gymnasium work will be re
sumed to-day, when Bat will box eight
rounds with Fred Landers.

NOVEL FRAUD
IN CYCLE RACE
Oakland Wheelmen Charged
With Tampering With the
Mechanism of a Boiler
The executive committee of the Cali
fornia Associated Cyclists has one of
the most novel cases of alleged fraud
to investigate that has ever developed
In cycling annals.
C. L. McEnerney, chairman of the
racing and records committee, charges
the Oakland Wheelmen with having
tampered with the machine on which
roller races were run last Tuesday.
Some ingenuous mechanic had affixed
brakes, made of rubber hose, to the
rollers on jhe big frame on which the
bicycles were ridden.
On looking over the framework before
the races between the Terminal City
Wheelmen of Stockton and the Oakland
Wheelmen, Mr. McEnerney found what
appeared to be some superfluous fas
tenings. He had the frame removed
from the floor and the whole mechan
ism was exposed.
The man who assisted an Oakland
rider to start could place his foot on a
piece of metal attached to a spring
which, in turn, applied the brake to
the machine of the other rider. If two
members of an outside club were rid
ing both of them could be slowed down
by pulling on a cord which passed
down through a hole in the stage.
The case was presented to the presi
dent of the association, Orrin S. Hen
derson of Stockton, who has ordered an
investigation, which will be held on
March 5 by the executive committee.
This is made up of the president and
K. Belloli of the Garden City; H. L.
Newsom, Bay City Wheelmen; J. F.
Wright, New Century Wheelmen, and
Henry Kroeckel of the Terminal City
Wheelmen. It is expected the club will
be expelled from the association.
AN UNDESERVED ARRFST.
Mr. K. I. A. Jake, in attempting to
befriend a lady who was evidently in
trouble, is turned upon by the irate
female, who considers his attentions
insulting and finally has an officer ar
rest him. Details of this injustice will
be seen in next Sunday's comic.
Handicap Tennis for Ladies.
A handicap singles tennis tourna
ment for the Cochran cup will be

EVERETT PLANT
ALSO IN DEAL
Millionaire Bernard Barouch
Is Here to Take Over
Both Smelter Properties
Among the latest arrivals at the St.
Francis Hotel are Bernard Barouch.
a New York millionaire, who. with a
number of wealthy associates, is ne
gotiating for the purchase of the Ta
coma smelter, and Captain H. C. Da
vis, a member of the well-known brok
erage firm of Hausman Brothers of
New York, who is also interested in
the deal. The recent reports that the
smelter trust is buying the Tacoma
property is emphatically denied by Ba
rouch, who announced yesterday that
he and his New York associates are in
no way allied with the American
Smelting and Refining Company, but
are buying the northern property on
their own account. In support of this
statement he added that the negotia
tions now pending include the pur
chase of the Everett smelter as well.
The latter plant is the property of the
American Smelting, Company.
The deal is expected to be closed in
a few days, when Barouch will return
to the East by way of the northern
route. Captain Davis' connection with
the deal is simply through the fact
that he is a stockholder in the Tacoma
smelter and was one of its founders.
Controlling the bulk of the stock of the
Tacoma smelter are the Bunker Hill
Mining Company, Alaska-Tread well
Mining Company, Alaska-Mexican
Mining Company and the Alaska
United Company. Through their hold
ings in these companies Banker D. O.
Mills of New York and F. W. Bradley
of this city gained their control of the
Smelter. The Everett smelter is ex
clusively the property of the trust.
It was said yesterday that as soon
as the deal is completed General Man
ager Rust of the Tacoma smelter will
assume charge of the Everett plant
and run both smelters.
Tetrazzini Will Sing To-Night
Signorina Tetrazzini has consented
as a special favor to the Tivoli man

Thia will be the first occasion in

Svram<*r Berkeley in Collision.
The ferry steamer Berkeley was run Into

Ft earn echooner Point Arena. The Berkeley
was crowded with passenger* who rushed
wildly to the after end hen the Point Arena's
biunt bow began to crumble up the ferry
boat's rail. The Berkeley, with Captain
BlaJjeley in ".and, was on her first trip
from Oakland, fclhe was crowded with passen
Â£<rs. As few women were aboard there was
Â«n absence of hysterics in the panic which
followed the collision, but there was a panic
Just the same. The Point Arena, Captain
Sliller, was coming up the bay, having just
ei rived from Point Arena. She had twenty
two pa*wnjjprs and a big deckload of lumber.
This load made her formidable as a ram.
The Berkeley was heading for her Flip when
the Point Arena's lookout first caw the ferry
riat looming up In the fog big as a church.
There was no chance to bark, so Captain MII
1t rang for full pp*=**d ahead and tried to
jiaF* ahead of the Berkeley. In the uncertain
l!*;ht he tÂ»ul<l not judge th* distance between
tii*- boats and the Point Arena's spurt ahead
Â«^n!y made matters worse. The Point Arena's

x\Â«s carried sway and one of her boats was
una^hed. The RÂ«-rkp'ey landed her passengers
â w ithin a few minutes. The Point Arena's

Spring Valley Company's Officials
Testify, but Uttle Definite Infor
mation Is Adduced.
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
resumed its investigation Into the fin
ancial operations of the Spring Valley
Water Works with a view to fixing
water rates for the next fiscal year.
Trie inquiry was desultory in the ex
treme and was directed to ascertaining:
the amount expended for new con
struction in the last year. Assistant
Engineer Williams answered a num
ber of questions relative to the cost of
laying pipe lines, but little if any def
inite information was obtained on the
subject. Williams agreed to prepare
a detailed statement showing the cost
of labor and other items in laying
mains. Chief Clerk Booker gave some
figures regarding meters, of which
there are 11.637 in use. Secretary Pel
ham Ames testified as to the manner
of keeping the accounts of the corpo
ration.
The committee directed Booker to
furnish a statement showing the seg
regated operating expenses and re
ceipts from all sources during 1904

ceipts and expenditures of the com
pany will be gone into.

lude to an anticipated holiday, assem
bled on the college campus on Wash
ington's birthday around a portrait of
Washington, gracefully draped with
the silken folds of the star-spangled
banner. A tribute of honor was ren
dered to the national hero in an orig
inal poem from the pen of one of the
sisters of the college. This was well
recited by Miss Winifred Harney. class
of 1905. Genuine patriotism was
evinced in the singing of the national
anthem by a chorus of 300 youthful
voices, followed by a salute to the flag.
DISASTROUS HINTING EXPEDI
TION.
The Messrs. Onion and their friend,
Mr. Murphy, started on a rabbit shoot
the other day, but scared up a rab
bit of unusual size, which turned the
tables on the erstwhile ninirods, with
the result that Mr. Murphy and his
companions lost their heads, which
went rolling down the hill, and the
whole affair ended in a rabbit stew.

ITALIANS SCORE
MANAGER LEAHY
Refusal to Permit Tetraz
zini to Sing for Verdi Mon
ument Sharply Criticized
COMMITTEE'S VERSION
Says He Threatened to Shut
the Tivoli Unless Prima
Donna Withdrew Promise
The following tetter from G. Amalgia
and Andrea Sbarboro of the Verdi
Monument Committee explains that
committee's position in the controversy
over Signora Tetrazzinis withdrawal
from the programme of the Verdi con
cert this evening:
Editor Call: The daily newspapers have
been publishing these days contradictory news
with regard to the appearance of Signora
Tetrazzlnl at the concert to be given Friday
night, February 24, at the Aihambra Theater
by the Minetti orchestra for the benefit of. the
Verdi monument to be erected in Golden Gate
Park. Some newspapers have Maud that tbe
announcement of the appearance of tbe great
prima donna was not genuine. For tola rea
son the undersigned who dealt with Signora
Tetrazzlni, think it their duty to give a brief
statement of the whole matter.
As it is known, a few years the dally news
paper L' ltalia started a subscription for the
erection of a monument in San Francisco to
the great Italian composer, Giuseppe Verdi.
To help said fund for the last two years tha
Italian artists that have appeared at the Tiv
oli, with the permission of the management of
that theater, each season volunteered to give
an entertainment. Tha amount raised was de
posited by Messrs. Aimagla A Patrizi, editors
of the Dally L, Italia, in the Italian- American
Bank to bear interest. The bank book bears
the name of Verdi's Monument Fund, M. J.
Fontana trustee.
On the occasion of the present season at tbe
Tivoli Opera-house it was hoped that another
entertainment, following the previous custom,
could be arranged with thÂ« artists singing
there, but when the manager of the Tivoli.
W. H. Leahy, was consalted In the matter he
absolutely refused to gram any permission,
giving reasons which are not worth mention
ing. The idea was dropped. During the last
two weeks A. SbarborA. a member of the
Vecdl monument committee, was insistently
requested by several American people, among
whom was Henry Payot Supervisor, to make
arrangements for an entertainment to thÂ« ef
fect above stated. Mr. Sbarboro went to Mr.
Leahy to. ask the permission and the manager
of the Tivolt again answered with a refusal.
It was th-n that Mr. Sbarboro, knowing that
the Minetti orchestra was going to give a con
cert on next Friday evening, asked Mr. Leahy
If he would at least allow Signora Tetrazzlni
to take part in that concert. Mr. Leahy said
that if Signora Tetrazzlnl did not sing that
night at the Tivoli he would probably give the
requested consent. The following day Signora
Tetrazzinl was consulted, and as soon as she
heard that her contribution was desired for the
Verdi concert she most enthusiastically de
clared that she would appear, saying that for
courtesy's sake Mr. Leahy's consent should
be asked. She stated, however, that she was
sure no objection would be made aa to her
appearance, adding that her contract with the
company was over, and that she was at liberty
to do as she pleased.
After this cordial acceptance by Signora
Tetrazzlnl, Mr. Sbarboro informed Mr. Leahy
of the prima donna's willingness to sing on
Friday evening, hoping that on his part he
would have no opposition ln the matter. Mr.
Leahy answered that he positively objected,
and it was then that Signora Tetrazzinl, hav
ing been informed of said refusal, wrote a let
ter stating and confirming that she was not
under any obligations with her managers, and
that, with or without their consent, she would
appear in the Minetti concert, singing the
cavatina of "La Travlata." An announce
ment was then accordingly made In the daily
papers.
After this was done the manager of the
Tivoli frightened Signora Tetrazzinl. warning
her that if she were going to elng in the con
cert the theater would be Immediately closed
and thÂ» season ended. This threat put Sig
nora Tetrazzlr.l In a trying position, for. while
she wanted to be true to her promise, she dis
llkerj to be the cause <>f the abrupt ending of
the season, thus causing great damage to her
companions and her Italian Impresario. There
fore the lady presented this dilemma to the
undersigned. Taking everything Into consid
eration, and, above all, for Signora Tetrazzln'.'s
sake, who so enthusiastically showed her wlll
irKtiess. they thought it best to drop the mat
ter and relieve Signora Tetrazzini of her writ
ten promise.
Tills is> the true state of affairs of this un
pleasant occurrence, and we leave It to the
public to make its comments. We only Wish
to show by thl? statement that thÂ« announce
ment of Signora Tetrazzlnl's appearance was
made a.biÂ«olutely In good faith.

EDUCATION IN FRANCE.
WE are so accustomed to consider France as an effete nation,
its vigor exhausted and its fading vitality evidenced by a de
clining birth rate, that it is something of a surprise to dis
cover that we are mistaken. France may not show as rapid increase
in population as other countries, but it is not neglecting any of the
means necessary to make of its people formidable competitors in the
commercial world with nations that boast a larger birth rate.
The United States may learn some things of vast importance to
our future, by a study of the methods by which France promotes the
commercial and manufacturing skill of her people. As a result we
may be impressed with the importance of giving our common school
education a practical turn, and making it the means of training our
youth in ways that are rendered impossible by the limitation of ap
prenticeship which has followed the rise of organized labor in this
country.
In 1880 the French Minister of Commerce was authorized by
law to organize manual' instruction in special schools. Later on
graduates of the commercial high schools were exempted from two
years' military service and in 1891 the National School of Foremen
and Workmen was created at Cluny. By 1904 the number of these
commercial and manual schools in France had risen to 2921, sup
ported by the Government. The National Institute of Arts and
Trades in Paris was built in 1884 at a cost of $2,000,000. In it are
laboratories for the study of physical science, and there are lectures
on art as applied to trades and industries. Each trade is equipped
with mechanism of all kinds required in the study of physics, chem
istry and other branches of science applicable to dyeing, ceramics,
glass-making and decoration, metallurgy and metal working and
other trades. The number of students admitted each year is limited
to 240. The curriculum covers architecture, natural sciences, me
tallic construction, building of machines, electricity, mining, public
work*, railways and industrial legislation.
In the commercial high schools, which are in Paris and dis
tributed throughout the provinces, the curriculum embraces finance,
geometry, foreign languages, commercial, fiscal and economic legis
lation and history, chemistry applied to industries, technology, ap
plied physics and stenography. In the provinces there are schools
of arts and trades at Compiegne, Chalons sur Marne, Angers, Aix and
Lille. These educate workmen capable of becoming foremen in in
dustries and versed in the mechanic arts. The teaching is actual
practice in the workshops. The number of students is limited to 300
for each school. The method in these schools is interesting. There
are four special workshops for practice in fitting machinery, cabinet
making and modeling, foundry work and manufacture of hardware.
The pupils are distributed among these shops, but all, during the
three years' course, learn what is taught in each department, so f hat
they become all round mechanics. The school at Cluny is devoted
especially to educating men for foremen in the wood and iron in
dustries.
There are also numerous state schools that do preparatory work.
That at St. Etienne is an example of all the schools of this grade.
They are free, and boys can enter at the age of 13, if provided with
;. certificate of primary education. Here they q-ot instruction and
daily practice in weaving, modeling in wood, fitting, cabinet making,
the nature of textile fibers, hemp, ramie, cotton and wool, the rearing
of silkworms, treatment of cocoons, silk twining, the bleaching- and
dyeing of cotton and silk and the chemistry of the process, and elec
tricity. Gun-making has recently been added, in all its progress from
the steel billets to the finished gun.
The foregoing is a bare sketch of what France is doing for
the commercial and industrial training of her youth. After & thcy
have received it their right to apply their knowledge is also protected
by the Government. It is obvious that France does not intend to
depend upon imported labor and skill to maintain her standing in
manufactures and commerce, nor does she propose to educate' her
youth to uselessness.
v Vâ 1^ Â° f Â°P inion that the time is near when the school system
of the Lmted States must accept such reorganization as is necessaiy
to make education something more than book knowledge, and trans
form it into an actual equipment for the business of life.
THE WEBER VERDICT.
THE verdict of the Auburn jury, finding Adolph Weber guilty
J[ of murder in the first degree, for the killing of his own mother,
ends the second chapter is an unusual tragedy. Because the
evidence was circumstantial, it was expected by many that the jury
would reach the wholly illogical verdict of murder" in the second
degree, or would reach a mistrial.
r v The . defense was unexpectedly weak. The testimony as pub
fished failed to successfully attack the evidence of the circumstances
The end, however, is a long way off. There will be a motion to
set aside the verdict as not justified by the testimony, and for a
new trial and then will come an appeal to the Supreme Court and
a long fight before that tribunal. Judge Prewett is one of the fore
most judicial officers in the State, and his rulings are rarely re
versed by the Supreme Court. Of course in a case like this, where
a life is at stake under circumstances of the keenest interest to
Judges and lawyers, the condemned man has some advantages aris
ing in the general policy of courts to give an accused and condemned
man every opportunity . to prove his innocence and save his life
Much time has elapsed since the commission of the crime, and the
defense has had every opportunity to find circumstances and testi
mony to offset those used by the prosecution, but this has not been
In such a case time is a great factor with the defense While
an ap^al is being perfected and heard there may be a disclosure of
facts and circumstances which will strengthen the defense and Wke

"That's right," Mrs. Barton agreed;
"see your own country first an' heath
en lands afterward. An' whore your
bridesmaids to be, Bessie?"
Elizabeth hesitated miserably. Mrs.
Barton's words were like salt in a new

so happily, and now that it was all
over, she could not forget It. She
waited, like a coward, for Nick, but he
sat quite silent.
"Your sister, of course," said Mrs.
Barton.
"Oh, it's allâ" Elizabeth stopped.
"All undecided," the old lady sug
gested. "I s'pose so. But June is
only three months off now. Goin' to
housekeepin' afterward, or goin' to

"Housekeeping," said Nick curtly.
"The curtain is going up again,"
Nick added hastily.
Elizabeth sat in comparative peace
through the rest of the programme;
then the last performer came to the
front of the stage â a boyish-looking
man in the conventional evening dress
of the vaudeville songster. The or
chestra preluded softly for a moment,
and over the darkened theater the
man's voice rang out Infinitely rich
and deep.
"Oh, 'twas sweet of old, when our

"Asthore," whispered Mrs. Barton,

REAPER TAKES MAN
WHO GAVE DINNER
TO 100 WIDOWS.
After a lingering illness A. A. Hew
lett, one of Syracuse's wealthiest and
most famous citizens, is dead.
It was only three years ago that
Howlett, then 77 years old, startled
the city by announcing that he pro
posed to give a dinner for all the
widows of his acquaintance. When
he had gathered them together In his
handsome home there was an even
100 of them. Howlett was the only
man present at the dinner.
Although he was a friend of wid
ows, a widow was the only person
who ever sued Howlett in his long
business career. She as Mrs. Marie
Valleau of New York, who, upon the
death of Howlett's son, Alfred Ames
Howlett. demanded 57500 of the |80,
000 estate which he left She said that
the son had provided for the bequest
In a codicil to his will.
Howlett said that he had never seen
the codicil, and he claimed the en
tire estate on the ground that his
son cwed him. the money.
So Howlett had to go to court for
the first time in his life, and the case
is still pending. *

DUBOIS' FISH DOG
Somebody out in Idaho gave Sen
ator Dubois' baby a dog last sum
mer. It was a mongrel, but the at
tachment between the child and the
puppy was so great that it was
brought on to Washington. One day
the pup, which in its early dog days
shows more plainly than ever that it
is a cur, followed the Senator to the
Capitol. "What kind of a dog is that,
Dubois?" asked Senator Bailey.
"That? That's a fish hound." Sena
tor Dubois told him. "Why, that's
the finest breed of dogs we have In
Idaho. Every morning that dog goes
down to a trout stream and brings in
a trout when we are in Idaho. He
never fails." "He must be a wonder
ful animal," agreed Senator Burrows.
"Wonderful doesn't half describe that
dog." Senator Dubois continued.
"Why, one morning we had no flsh
in the house and what do you think
that dog did? Why, he went out and
brought in a can of sardines." â Chi

Association for Improve
ment"; and Adornment of
San Francisco's Ideas on
the Beautifying of City
(tRaDES QUESTION
RElN<t CONSIDERED
it.v Officials on Public
Boards May Be Able to
Render Organization a
Vast Deal of Assistance
A better system of streets and
boulevards for greater San Fran
cisco is one of the objec's that the
Association for the Improvement
and Adornment of San Francisco is
seeking to obtain. With the sug
gestioÃS of Architeot Burnham have
been coupled others in effect that it
is the desire of persons interested
in the improvement of the city
that the manic pal officials should
make greater efforts to remedy the
present deplorable condition of the
streets- The association members
say a city must bs clean before it
can be made beautiful
San Francisco will goon emerge from
the period of crudism and enter upon
one that will tend to smooth over its
rough points and make way for the
beauty doctor. The beauty doctor in
San Francisco's case is Architect D.
H. Burr-ham and his assistants are the
members of the Association for the
Improvement and Adornment of San
Francisco. There are several hundred
of these worthy nursers of a good cause,
and the capital operation under which
the city will soon be relieved of the
incubus of disease-breeding' sewers
and dirty, ill-paved streets . will make
"a new man" of us.
From his bungalow on the slope of
Twin Peaks Hr. Burnham is studying
nature and basalt blocks. He will make
the residence district blossom as th 2
roÂ«e and the highways and byways
will be straightened out and the city
asfced to compel dwellers therein to
"bey the law requiring that rubbish
be deposited in receptacles intended to
receive it and not flung: to the four
.vinds to make of thoroughfares that
b smells to heaven, and not very
pleasantly at that.
BURXnAM'S PROGRAMME.
According t-- tht; programme laid out
by the Association. undÂ«r advice of
Mr. Burnham. the system of boule
vards and avenues drawn upon pre
uminary plans is dt-vUed with the idea
of so distributing traffic on certain
streets that no one thoroughfare shall
be overcrowded or worn down by
heavy tiamin^. The paving of Mar
ket street and the raising of sunken
streets to the official grade is a serious
m and one that will be given
careful attention. It has been prac
tically decided among eminent local
engineers that to prevent the gradual
subsidence of streets in the east side
of the rity that weie laid on made
ground the piling system must be
adopted. Buildings constructed on
ground east of Sansome street have
been kept on the official grade by the
resistance afforded by piling, the spar
being held in place in loose, damp
soil by natural suction. The restrain
ing seawall, it is thought, will not ob
viate ths further sinking of Market
There are miles of streets in this city
that will have to be repaved, and. once
repavetl. must be kept clean. The bond
is*ue proving for a large part of the
contemplated improvements, but the
acceptance of street work bonds is said
to be exceptionally slow. However,
now that local banks have bid in many
of the street and sewer bonds, it is
thought that all of the issues will soon
be placed. But an enormous amount
of money will be required to plaoe the
street* in repair, as months of neglect
have caused them to v.ear down un
til In many places they are beyond re
pair. Nearly everybody interested in
the improvement of the city Is als-j
against the resetting of basalt block
streets unless the work is done with
concrete capping.
BASALT BLOCK REPAIRING.
The basalt block streets have, to a
certain extent, it is luarned by those of
the association, been repaired in some
localities by simply having a force of
men dig up the blocks and relay them
in the sand Where the grade has sunk
fand is> hauled to fill the street up to
the grade. After resetting the inter
- are filled by shoveling over the
blocks a mixture of dirt and gravel.
Water makes such a "repaired" street
a mass of mud. and dry winds turn it
into a stretch of fine dust.
Two claeaes of street pavement are
under consideration by the association.
Some ol the members favor such as is
laid on Third street, which is bnealt
blocks on a solid foundation and filled
in with cement- This method prevents
the earth from working up between the
block*, and provided the street is swept
and sprinKled it will always be clean.
Asphalt and bitumen will be used on
nearly all of the proposed boulevards
â¢where light traffic renders it prefer
able.
Secretary Thomas McCaleb of the as
sociation says that the street improve
ment scheme is one of the important
plans uf the organization, but as yet
Mr. Burnham has not got down to
specific Ideas in the matter. There is
a vajt deal of work to be done and the
association members naturally expect

W. Delano escaped with some severe
bruises and lacerations. The mishap
occurred yesterday on the steep grade

Mrs. Delano started from her home,
72 South Broderick street, in the ma
chine, â¢which she is accustomed to
handle herself. Just as she neared the
residence of William Corbin something
connected with the mechanism of the
car snapped and the ponderous vehicle
started to roll rapidly down the hill.
In vain Mrs. Delano tugged at the
levers. The automobile gained mo
mentum at every yard, and all that the
terrified woman could do was to cling
to the lever and pray that the car
would not plunge over a steep em
bankment that lined the road. Several
at Mrs. Delano's neighbors saw her
speeding to certain destruction (as
they* thought), but were powerless to
help her.
Almost in front of the Delano home
the rapidly moving: car swerved and
overturned. Mrs. Delano was pinned
undei it. Several women who saw the
accident hurried to the rescue, and,
â vith the help of Mrs. Delano's two
boys, raised the car and pulled her out.
Mrs. Delano was badly shaken up,
and it i? believed that her shoulder
hag been dislocated. The woman chauf

of \V. W. Delano of Delano Bros. The
automobile was a Christmas present

Boa Disappears Mysteriously.
The police are endeavoring to elu
cidate the mystery of the disappear
ance of a feather boa valued at tlo
and belonging to Mrs. Webster, 212
Ashbury street. Mrs. Webster was
one of a party that took a ride in an
automobile on Wednesday. She left
her boa in the machine- A. Young,
the chauffeur, reported to the police
that after the party left the mach'ne
he took "Jack" Johnson, the colored
pugilist, and a woman friend for a
ride and returned with them to a fca
leon at Kearny and Bush streets. He
saw the boa after Johnson and his
friend entered the machine, but T.hfn
he reached the garage on Market
street the boa was missing.
Eliminate from the blood the uric and
lactic acids that cause rheumatism by
using Lash's Kidney and Liver Bitters. *
for the purpose outlined, If the one
serious ploblem â clean, paved streets â
can be overcome.
The proposed park at the ferry depot
will have to be raised to the official
grade if its creation is ever undertaken.
In this event the State Board of Har
bor Commissioners will have to raise
the grade of East street several feet to
conform with the changed grade of
Market street.. This the board will un
doubtedly do if the city agrees to place
Market street on an unyielding founda
tion of piling from the waterfront to
Sansome The ferry building was
placed on a foundation of piling and
according to ex-Chief Engineer Howard
C. Holmes, under whose supervision the
building was constructed, there has
been practically no settlement in spite
of the immense weight of the building.
If the plans of the association can be
carried out successfully with the aid
of the city's official department the
fresh, healthy summer winds of San
Francisco will no longer bring with
them the curge of dust and sand and
the odor 3of caved In sewers.
AD VERTISEMENTS.
Mention Cooking With Gas to Him
When you're engaged. If he is favorable, take him ;
he's up to date, and he'll get there. But if he says
no, look for another.
THAT'S OUR ADVICE, GIRLS!
Always beware of the man who wants his wife to be
a houseljold drudge. We've had experience.
BUY A GAS RANGE FROM

Plunge Into Boiling Surf to SaTe
Little Girl.
Two modest boy heroes pulled a
little girl out of the 'surf at the Ocean
Beach yesterday. The brave little
men are Lyman Shaw. 13 years old,
and Arnold Davido. 14.
The little girl, whose name could
not be learned, was wading in the
water near the Olympic Salt Water
Company's pier. Suddenly the treach
erous undertow caught her and a
breaker overwhelmed her. She was
being rapidly drawn out to sea when
the two boys rushed into the surf
and caught her just in time.
For a while the strong undertow
threatened to drag away all three, but
the boys braced themselves firmly, and
after a desperate struggle drew the
girl to safety. She was sent home by
her mother and the two boys hurried
away to escape the congratulations of
the spectators.

WARSAW STRIKE
RIOTS RENEWED
Mobs Resort to Violence
and Government Is Power
less to Restore Order
DAMAGE TO BAILBOADS
Western Poland Entirely Cut
Off From Communication
With the Best of Europe
WARSAW, Feb. 24 (2 a. m.).â The
| strikers are resorting to violence. They
have destroyed the great switchboard
; station outside the city and out a num
i ber of telegraph wlrea.
WARSAW, Feb. 23.â The situation
here Is causing the greatest anxiety
lin all circles. The assistant of the
j Governor General, who was Interviewed
| to-day, frankly admitted that the Gov
ernment was at a loss to know what
to do. Alarming reports are current
concerning the intention and plans of
j the revolutionary party, and March 4
!Is awaited with much apprehension.
I The strike agitation Is spreading In
j every direction and bank clerks, Jour
j nallsts, office servants, printers, driv
j era and stationary engineers and mc
i chanics in general are all threatening
| to walk out.
Western Poland is completely cut off
I from communication with Middle and
j Western Europe, except by telegraph,
iNo malls are arriving or leaving. The
! city is threatened with a coal famine.
The Governor General has offered to
supply military men to work the
i trains, but it is Impracticable, as the
strikers have destroyed switches.
Many through passengers from Mos
i cow and St. Petersburg are detained
here, and great quantities of perish
; able goods from France and Italy are
being ruined by the delay.
BAKU, Feb. 23.â The town is now
j quiet. All the Armenian shops have
been closed, but the banks are doing
. business under military protection. Or
der has been restored at Balakhany,
'; but at Romany to-day strikers at
: tacked two factories and tnirty persons
â¢ were killed or wounded.
In Baku many murders have been
! committed. Manager Adamoff of the
i NaphtDa Refining Works, his wife and
children were burned to death.
A legal official named Tatasoff and a
i bazaar owner named Lalajeff and the
latter's family were murdered.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Feb. 23.âEx
| tremely alarming reports are current
' here concerning the situation at Ba
toum and Poti. It is alleged that some
vessels of the Black Sea squadron
: (Russian) have bombarded Poti. An
{ English merchant who has Just 'arrived
here says he was obliged to flee from
< Batoum, where his life was menaced
:by strikers and his office destroyed.
This merchant says the authorities of
! Batoum are powerless. The strikers
j are all Georgians and are estimated to
number 40,000.
FIRE FAILS TO CONCEAL
EVIDENCE OF MURDER
Body of Wealthy New Jersey Woman
Found in Charred Ruins of
Her Home.
MONTCKA.IR. N. J.. Feb. 23. â Fol
lowing the discovery of the body of
Mrs. Hannah B. Ross, a wealthy oc
togenarian, in the ruins of her home
in High street to-day, the police ex
pressed the opinion that the woman
had been murdered and the house
fired to conceal the crime. A Ger
man coachman, who was the only do
mestic employed by Mrs. Ross, has
not been seen since the fire. A search
of the ruins failed to reveal any trace
of his body.
Three adjacent houses were de
stroyed by the fire which started in
the Ross house, but the occupants had
no difficulty in escaping.
Mrs. Ross made her will last Sat
urday and it was witnessed by the
missing coachman. The house and
the large collection of valuable furni
ture which it contained she left to
her adopted daughter, a Mrs. Rupe of
Baltimore. When her body was
found it was completely dressed.
The police believe that if she was
murdered the motive was one of re
venge and not robbery. All the
woman's rings were found on her
fingers.

NO ALLOWANCE
FOR LEAKAGE
Wine and Liquor Importers
Must Pay Duty on All That
Is Shipped From Abroad
IMPOBTANT DECISION
Board of United States Gen
eral Appraisers Makes Bill
ing Affecting Many Cases
NEW YORK, Feb. 23.â Importers of
! wlnea and liquors must pay duty on
the full quantity shipped from abroad
' without regard to leakage or breakage
| "in transit," under a decision handed
j'down to-day by the Board of United
i States General Appraisers. The de
| cision Is considered of great import -
! ance, as there are many hundreds of
j similar cases which probably will be
' settled in accordance with the prlnci
; pies therein laid down.
The case Involves the construction
of a portion of the present tariff act
which provides that there shall be no
constructive or other allowance for
breakage, leakage or damage on wines,
liquors, cordials or distilled spirits.
The board says that the phrase "a
constructive allowance" for leakage
would seem to imply an allowance for
a leakage Which might be presumed
or implied, or which existed in con
templation of law rather than for an
actual leakage established by affirma
tive proofs. Therefore, should the en
tire contents of a cask of liquor leak
out "in transit," before the arrival in
the United States, the case would be
one of non-importation and no duty
would be assessable.
Where liquors or wines were import
ed in bottles, packed as required by
law, and a breakage of a portion of
the bottles occurred "in transit," no
deduction or allowance could be made.
ACCIDENTALLY ASPHYXIATED. âThomas
Pemberth was accidentally asphyxiated at his
room at 33 Sixth atraet last night. He was
revived at the Central Emergency Hospital by
Dr. Pawllcki.

"Mail advices from New Tori say:
"An active demand for Prunes from the re
-Â«.il tradt Is reported by jobbing grocery houses
&zA the latter are moving oat their stocks
quit* freely. The rather sudden and decided
increase in the consumptive demand Is not yet
rejected by any marked improvement in the
demand from Uw jobbers themselves. They
loaiinu* to buy on the hand-to-mouth order.
but are perhaps more frequently in the market.
On tbe coast the situation is reported to be
steadily gaining in strength, -the large sizes
beitc perhaps in better shape than any other
except 90*. and emalier fruit. The strength of
the market for the large ."izee is due to the
close concentration of coast Â«to<*s, as a cul
minatioo of a movement to that end, which Is
understood 10 have been in progress for some
time. According to the latest advices received
ere, there are now not over half a dozen
holders of 30s. 40s and 50s in the Santa Clara
Valley. Outside of the valley the stock of
these sizes is virtually exhausted. After a
period of extreme dullness, extending over
iomÂ« >-:rty Â£aya. the market for California
Kaifcna Is believed to be on the eve of an lm
i rovor.itct bo far at least as demand is con
cerned and possibly also in prices. There
have been sales of old coart seeded, which
were fancy when packed, as low as Be, but it
Is now acJd to be doubtful If any could be
found be-low &%c, and very little at that. Reâ
tailers' stocks are believed to have been worked
down and - ben are said to be carrying little.
Â«o that the spring demand is expected to be
E.orxÂ£al. With stocks on the coast relatively
tra&il and cor. trolled by the packers. It Is be
lieved that th* beginning of inquiries from
this quarter for forward shipments will be
the signal for an advance in t. o. b. prices.
In some Quarters it is thought that the pack
ers may not wait for the demand, but may
take the initiative by announcing an advance
of at least a quarter of a cent a pound. There
is only a limited demand for Currants and
fikk. prices are comewhat nominal, while
cables from Greece report an easy feeling due
to continued lack of business. .There con
tinues a very fair jobbing demand for spot
Apricots and Peaches, actual business in
which however. It kept within narrow bound*
by the paucity of offerings at prices buyers
are prepared to pay."

N<\Â» Stock Market.
.N KW YORK. Feb. 23.â There was violent
!-i -Â«cul&tive activity and excitement in stocks
it â¢ day and tome very feverish price move-
ments. The surmises to explain the move
nitntsi were so perplexed as to unsettle the
' ::..i! k. i from time to time. But Its resjstlng;
I pewter was impressive and the prioe level was
i'oi much impaired, even where the influences
v. ere on the side of doubt and depression.
This was the case in the railroad list when
pient-takim? on an enormous scale and an un
easiness aroused by a sensational movement
ia the specialties induced the selling to out
weigh the buying. The Southern Iron group
v*a* again the sensational feature and It -was
tiuring the raoet violent ebullitions in these
stocks that the general list was most inclined
to sell off. Another advance in Union Pacific
v.as the most effective sustaining influence.
tui. that stock also was unfavorably affected
at times by the rocket-like flights of the
iion stocks. Union Pacific recovered all of
iis 2 jier cent dividend, ... came oft to-day,
Â»incS allowing (or that made a new high record.
St. Paul was most Immediately in sympathy
vitfc it. although the Southwestern were
helped to come extent. The buoyancy of the
ttevthcro Iron stocks caused the advance in
tt.c Southern railroad croup, but was . of no
Kffcittance otherwise to -prices. Rumors and
- assertions ac to the stage reached in the at
tempt to effect a merger of the Southern Iron
Mocks were various, and many of them con
flicting. The convulsive movements in those
t-toclcs reaching many points between trans
a< tons. were of a kind which are msuiÂ«Jl>
made only under distress and excitement, such
a* are made by a corner. Sloss-Shef field
tteel rose 1Â«H. preferred 1Â«; Tennessee Coal,
HH: Republic Steel. 3%, and Republic Steel
preferred. 7. An additional factor In the in
fluence which these movements had upon sentl
r..-:-.; was the Jump of lÂ»\i In International
Power, a etock which is held In memory on
account of a sensational episode on the Stock
Exchange a number of years ago and which
is affiliated to the present movement in the
Southern Iron nooks by the Identity of some
of the active factors In the movement. The
existence of a situation or organization de
eigned to merge tne Iron properties was prob
ably the undisputed fact developed out of to
day's Â»verts. As to the achievement of con
, trol of the properties affected or as to the
t*rms offered for securing ths> object the
riporU current were hopelessly infused. The
rumors of peace which lifted prices abroad
yesterday during the holiday here helped the
< cr"y advance, but this Influence shifted to :
tfce eide of reaction during the Cnj m*en the
htlance of opinion shifted In favor of the con
tinuance of the war. The failure to reduce
thr- jofficTal discount rat* of the Bank of Ens- ;
!and and a .1 nine In the private rate for
discounts in London were disappointments.
BÂ» was the continuance of the war of rates
on export grain. Engagements of gold for
South America, although small, are given ad
d.tonal importance glnce the currency move
ment Is stilting In favor of 'be interior. Call
r?or.ey went to 3 per cent late in the day.
Tfcls it supposed to be due In part to prepara
tion fcr the payment of subscriptions to thÂ« :
Southern Pacific bond Issue, which are to be
paid in three daily installments of J25.0C0.C00,
the final payment to be made on Monday.
The rise in call money and the violent reac
tions in tbe iron stocks carried prices ,off
ffcarply during the flnal hour to an average
level considerably "below Tuesday, but the final
ra"!y on covering of shorts substantially re
rsired the prict level. The closing, however,
vas unsettled and Irregular.
Bonds were Irregular. Total sales, par
value, $6,756,000.

â¢Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
i The feature yesterday was the sharp drop la
Eggs, due to the heavy arrivals during the
past forty-eight hours, appearing below. Al
most every dealer in town had more than he
could take care of and some were heavily
; overloaded. The Tatter were offering ranch
down as low as 19c, but they did not sell any
better at thle price than at 20c. There were
i more Kgxs on the market than at any time
| eince last summer, and everybody was com
: plaining of the dullness of trade.
There was no further change In Butter, the
[ market continuing in good shape for sellers.
: Brokers were trying to get out a car for ship
ment to-day, but were finding some difficulty
In obtaining the grades wanted lor this ac
count.
Cheese remained as previously quoted.
Receipts for forty-eight hours were 94.700
lbs Butter, 1710 cases Eggs and 10,900 lbs
Cheese.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
Oranges continue to move freely and, al
though prices are no higher, the market has a
steady tone. There is very little strictly fancy
fruit available at the moment and stocks of
the lower grades are steadily decreasing. Ac
cording to advices from the southern growing
districts, there is very little fruit left In the
packing-houses, and it is not probable that
S shipments will be resumed on a large scale
: for some days. Three carloads of ordinary
i fruit were auctioned on Wednesday fancy cell
ing at $1 20@l 65. choice at $I@l 35 and
I standard at 75cÂ®$l. There were liberal ar
rivals of Mexican Limea by the Panama steam
ler and prices declined sharply. Stocks of Ap
: pies have been greatly reduced during the past
few days and the market is firmer for good
sound stock. There Is plenty of partially de
cayed stock on hand, which Is being pressed
for sale at the inside quotation, but there is
no sound stock available at less than $1 per
box. A carload of the Ben Davis variety came
in from Oregon yesterday and sold at $1 26<Â§

EXCITING MAN-HUNT
DRAWS CROWD.
WOMAN GIVES CHASE TO SUSPECT
UNTIL HIS ARREST IS EFFECTED
Mrs. Emma Hoffman, wife of Wil
liam C. Hoffman, a restaurateur at
417 O'Farrell street, was proclaimed a
heroine last night when she followed
a fleet-footed dishwasher, Harry Wil
son, who had been in her husband's
employ, and had him arrested on an
dieted charge of arson.
Seldom has the lower part of O'Far
rell street witnessed a man hunt which
began and ended so dramatically.
Harry Wilson had been engaged in
kitchen duties at the Hoffman restau
rant, and was deemed such a reliable
man that the fullest trust was reposed
in him â much so that the Hoff
mans went' out on the evening of
Thursday, February 2. leaving him in
full charge or ihe establishment.
The following day Mrs. Hoffman
missed her jewelry, valued at 5120,
which she had left at home the pre
vious night, and made a report of her
loss to the police. She says that Wil-
Eon changed Â«n disposition and took to
drink. He became nervous and her hus
band discharged him on Sunday, the
Bth insL Before leaving he expressed
a strong hope that the Hoffmans would
fail in business.
At 8 o'clock last night Mrs. Hoffman
was alarmed by finding that a fire had
broken out in an outhouse. It was ex- '
tinguished, but a little later an
other fire burst out in the same place.,
and or. going to extinguish it Mrs
Hoffman saw Wilson leaving the out
house, v. here a blazing oil-soaked cloth
and a box of matches were beginning
to do their work.
Mrs. Hoffman followed Wilson as he
took to his heels, and cried out to the
people in the vicinity to stop him.
At Ellis and Taylor sere^ts he
was brought to a halt by i.. E. Rose,
night clerk at the Clarendon Hotel. '
Post street. Rose thought him a foot- !
pad, and in the struggle that ensued 'â 
Rose was thrown down and sustained
an injury to ore of his hands. Wilson j
was marched back to the restaurant
by some men, followed by a great
crowd, but managed to escape from his
captors.
Again Mrs. Hoffman took up Che
chase, and kept op with the fleeing I
mantintil he v as caught by Policemen ,
J. B. Hurd, K. L. Smith and James
Peaii in the vicinity of the Tivoli Op- '
era-house.
Wilson was charged- with arson, but "
stoutly denied the accusation. ]

PANIC CAUSED
BY EXPLOSION
- An explosion of sewer gas sent the
cover of a manhole at Fourth and
Howard streets hurling through the
air yesterday afternoon shortly before
1 o'clock. The explosion was accom
panied by a noise that resembled the
boom cf a cannon and could be heard
for blocks. Fortunately no one was
hurt, though several persons miracul
cusly escaped death or serious injury.
The explosion was the result of a
gathering of sewer gas In fhe main.
The holes of the manhole must have
been stopped up and this caused the
gas to gather. Tho iron cover of the
manhole was hurled more than fifty
feet in the air and fell with a crach
or the sidewalk, breaking into small
fragments.
A vast crowd was attracted by the
unique spectacle and for a while traffic
at Fourth and Howard streets was
completely blocked. A man driving a
light buggy passed directly over the
manhole a few seconds, before the ex
plosion occurred. The . horse took
fright at the noise and but for the
timely action of his driver would have
dashed into an approaching car.
Several men wore standing but a few
feet from the manhole before it blew
up anc* how they escaped injury is
miraculous. When the manhole cover
flew into â .the. -air- it presented a queer
spectacle and men,, women and chil
dren ran for ' cover. Several women
became frightened, at , the explosion
and one. of them was nearly prostrated
by the shock: ...--â . ; .

BOX TRUST
FORMED BY
LUMBER MEN
Capitalists All Over the
Pacific Coajt Unite to
Raise the Prices on the
Producers and Dealers
LOCAL FIRMS WILL
BE HEAVY LOSERS
When the New Schedule of
Kates Is Fixed Combine
Will Profit to the Ex
tent of $1,000,000 a Year
Lumber mills and box manufacturers
of the Pacific Coast, from California to
British Columbia, have reached an
agreement which will soon result in an
increase in the cost of boxes to packers
of dried fruits, raisins, salmon, canned
fruits and vegetables and deciduous
fruits, oranges and lemons. The pro
ceedings have been kept as secret as
possible. Parties prominent in the pro
ceedings deny that any agreement has
been reached concerning the percentage
of advance in prices to be made, but
admit an increase is in view.
Canning companies have been in
formed that the advance will be 10 per
cent on this basis. The various puck
ing and shipping industries of the
coast will soon have to pay $1,000,000
more per annum for their boxes than
heretofore.
Great excitement exists among the
canners because of this move. One
concern in this city estimates thut it
alone will have to pay from $40,000 to
$50,000 more this year than expected.
Simultaneously it is announced that
the lumber mills and box manufactur
ers, during their recent deliberations,
caused an estimate to be submitted t,o
them concerning the amount of box
material that can be considered a sur
plus above the home demand, the rea
son being that the Southern â¢ Pacific
Company has made a rate of forty
cents on box shooks from Pacific Coast
points to the Missouri River, as against
a former rate of fifty cents. This new
rate was <?ffecti\e February 11. The
packing industries at Omaha and in
that vicinity make a large demand for
boxes. Lumber is becoming scarcer
in the East. Besides that consideration
is the fact that in making a rate for
shooks the transportation company
paves the way for new- business over
its own lines entirely. It appears to
the canning companies that this move
also contains a threat. Canners can
pay the price asked or not. If they
decline the surplus that is shipped to
the Missouri River will be all the
larger, fur there is a ready market for
boxes at the river.
While many box makers and lumber
companies are concerned, the leaders
in the movement to put up the price
f>f boxes are the California Pine Box
and Lumber Company and the North
ern Box Manufacturers' Agency. Of
the last named corporation C. F. White
is the president. He has recently been
in this city and worked hard for the
formation of an agreement. The head
quarters of his corporation are at Port
land, where White has gone. Connect
ed with the Northern interests of lum
ber mills and box makers are S. B.
Cobh, H. F. Padgham, S. E. Wrenn,
H. F. Prael, William F. McGregor, H.
L,. Bennett, J. C. Barline. George H.
Emerson and A. A. Courtenay. The
last named is the secretary and man
ager of the Northern Box Manufac
turers' Agency, a combination of manu
facturers and lumber interests.
One estimate of the boxes annually
consumed on the Pacific Coast is 2,500,
000. The output of San Francisco alone
is 50,000,000 feet of box shooks a year.
The value of the shooks is about $20 a
1000 feet. Ten per cent advance implies
$2 more per 1000 feet to be collected
from the canners and assessed^ either
to the canners or to the men who pro
duce the raisins, deciduous fruits, vege
tables, oranges, etc., for market. It is
probable that the announcement of an
increase in prices of 10 per cent will
be made in a few days.
In another direction the lumbermen
have moved to increase prices. At a
meeting of the Pacific Coast Lumber
Manufacturers' Association it was de
cided to make a general advance in
prices averaging about fifty cents all
along the line. With the exception of
lath, which were advanced twenty-five
cents per 1000 pieces, the changes were
for an advance of from fifty cents to
$1 per 1000 feet.

OWLS AND TREE TOADS

Vagrant Wooes Morpheus Amid
Branches of Park Forest
DARWINIAN IS DISAPPOINTED
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
When the policeman said that he
had arrested Gustave Bernson for
sleeping in trees Police Judge Mogan,
who is a Darwinian disciple, looked
long and earnestly at the defendant.
If his Honor expected to be rewarded
by discovery of rare prehensila qual
ity of limb he was disappointed, for
there was nothing indicative of elas
ticity, about the arms or legs of Mr.
Bernson. He was stockily and tur
dily built, slow of movement and slug
gish of intellect. A less ape-like hu
man being: would be difficult to find.
So the Judge sighed and requested
Patrolman C. E. Finney to taU him
more about it.
There wag not much of a story. For
three consecutive weeks the defendant
had haunted Golden Gate Paik,
perching in trees by night and forag
ing for food by day. He was clearly
a vagrant and as such had been ar
rested and booked.
"How did he manage to sleep and
avoid falling to earth?" his Honor
asked.
"He's a wonder," was the irrevjlant
answer.
Mr. Bernson's nativity was exposed
: by his dialect ere he informed \he
court that he was born and bred in
Sweden. From childhood, he sai<l, he
had a penchant for roosting in treus
and when he came to the United
States and went lumbering in the fr
forests of Washington he was urged
by prudence as well as desire to perch
aloft while his fellow toilers reclined
upon terra flrma. The ground was
damp and sodden and coyotes prowled
around the sleeping lambermen be
low, while he bafflel both malaria and
wild beasts by taking his forty winks
among the balsamic foliage. Had he
never fallen? Never. Even when
nightmare attacked him and ,he un
consciously thrashed and twisted to
escape its onslaught he did not tum
ble from his arboreal couch. He
couldn't explain his ability to cling
physically while he was inert mental
ly any more than he could explain his
preference for wooing Morpheus with
the birds and tree toads. ,
Of the trees in Golden Gate Park
he h.nd good words to say. They were
so varied of species as to give n>Â»w
zest to his desire to utilize them for
sleeping quarters. In the fir forest it
became monotonous to occupy the
same kind of tree night after night,
but in the park one could have a dif
ferent sort of leafy environment at
I will. He favored oaks because their
. branches were more horizontal than
those of any of their neighbors. Euca
lypti were all right for a lodger with
pulmonary complaint, but their pun
gent odor was disagreeable to the per-

"Well," said the Judge, "as you are

Special Policeman E. F. Behring
i testified that he was knocked down |

] he had no scars to show, while Mr.
I Bannon displayed a wound on the top
'of his head which, he averred, was ,
i made by a police club.
"Nobody clubbed him," said Behr
| ing to Judge Cabaniss, "he got that cut
, by falling upon the sidewalk."*
I "The location of the bruise indicates
, that he dived to the sidewalk," re
! marked the court dryly.
It was shown that Mr. Bannon be
1 came angered because he was not per
mitted to sleep in Charles Leonard's
lodging-house, 22 East street, and that
Special Behring was summoned to re
move him. For disturbing the peace
he was sentenced to twenty-four

Three little maids with auburn hair
were "doing the line" last Tuesday
evening when three young fellows
aroused their ire to such extent that
complaint was made to Patrolman
Parrell and two of the male juveniles
were arrested for disturbing the peace,
their companion eluding capture then
and identification which might lead to
it subsequently. Charles Augustus and
Joe Murphy were the names given by
the prisoners to the booking sergeant,
and to Judge Conlan they said they
"woiked fer a livin'."
Audible and annoying comment on
their ferruginous 'tresses provoked the
maidens to complain of the defendants.
It being the eve of a holiday, Market
street at 8 o'clock had a Saturday
evening aspect, the sidewalks being
thronged with folk who seemed to have
no palpable purpose other than to
walk, and as one of the fair trio in
elegantly expressed it, to "rubber at
each other." She and her chums were
sauntering, with arms interlocked and
not "rubbering" at all, the prosecu
tion alleged, when their ears were as
sailed by the following expressions ut
tered behind them: ,
"Mine is de inside brick."
"De middle brick fer me."
"I'll take de outside brick."
As they were evidently the subjects
of the allusionsâ the term "brick" be
ing employed because of the hue of
their coiffures â they were greatly an
noyed, especially as when they turned
around and looked at the commenta
tors they saw total strangers. They
subdued their anger, however, until
they met Patrolman Foley. The rest
has been told.
As the young: ladles did ntft appear
to prosecute, and &g the policeman had i
acted solely on hearsay, and as the de- ,
fendants were "woikin' fer a livln' "
and would be likely to lose their em- |
ployments if sent to prison, the Judge
dismissed the case.

Ernest Sponberg, a student at a Mis
sion-street business college, was pass
ing a Third-street apartment house
last Tuesday evening when he saw two
women at a second-story window, one
of whom, he thought, smiled at him
invitingly. He smiled in return, but
fearing that he was too far distant
and the gloaming was too dense to
make his response visible to the lady,
he ascended to her chamber and
rapped at the door, which was imme
diately opened.
"Veil, goils," he said, amiably, "here
I vas," and entered the unlighted
apartment.
Then, to his intense \ surprise, the j
two women ran out, screaming, "Po- |
lice!" and slammed the door behind |
them. He groped in the gloom to find
an exit, buf became entangled with !
various articles of furniture and was
wallowing in wreckage when Patrol- '
man J. J. Tillman' nabbed him.
The two women positively denied i
that either of them had smiled at the
defendant or noticed him at all and j
declared they thought he was a rob
ber when he entered their room un- '
invited. Judge Conlan dismissed him
with a warning against raising his eyes
to second-story windows after night
fall.

suspicion to Hi Bins Lo, who warmly
contended that his suey was entirely
destitute of quadruped of any kind,
but they declined to take his word 'or
it and tendered 60 cents in payment
for what they had consumed, whereas
the scheduled price was double that
sum. Hi Bing Lo refused the tender,
whereupon they laid it upon his table
and departed â to be overtaken a mo

Hi Bing Lo reiterated in court that

pressed readiness to withdraw his
complaint if the defendants would pay
h'm another 60 cents. On that basis
the case was settled.

selves on having such a wide
awake guardian. Thus it was that
the quartet visited a place of enter
tainment in the 300 block of O'Farrell
street, where Mr. Meany's sophistica
tion gradually succumbed to slumber.
When He awoke his friends were ab
sent and so was a $20 gold piece which
he had placed for safe keeping in an
inner pocket of his vest.
If the policeman who arrested Miss
Ida Lehman had charged her with
larceny instead of vagrancy there
would have been a better chance of
her conviction and a recovery of Mr.
Meany's double eagle, but the vag-
