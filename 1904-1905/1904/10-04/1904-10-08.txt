Investigation Of the Conduct of the Quartermaster's Department May Cause a Complete Change of Officials in the Local Transport Service
Vigilance of the Administration Is Demonstrated
by Its Action to Protect the Country's Interests
FIRST â Complaint has been made to Brigadier General Humphrey, quartermaster general, that irregularities exposed by the Chamberlain and
Maus reports two years ago still exist.
SECONDâ The War Department has ordered many changes of clerks and heads of departments, being determined that the service shall be con
ducted on a strictly business basis.
THIRD â A board of inquiry consisting of three officers has delved into the accounts of drsying cempanies and other concerns patronized by
the War Department with a view to determining whether the Government has been imposed upon.
COMPLAINT OF IRREGULARITIES AND APPOINTMENT OP BOARD OP INQUIRY.
HEAD OF WAR DEPARTMENT WHO HAS ORDERED AN INVESTIGATION OF
TRANSPORT SERVICE AT THIS PORT. CHIEF OF QUARTERMASTER' S
DEPARTMENT AND HIS LOCAL. REPRESENTATIVE.
A highly important phase of the
situation 13 that Manila is warning San
Francisco through Washington to be
more careful in sending: merchandise
to the islands. Imitationsâ -goods un
der spurious labels â have been forced
on the island markets and the result
has been that orders have been di
verted to foreign sources of supply.
The local board of Inquiry ques
tioned Chief Clerk H. W. Bennett, a
eastern stations; the game of. change
is still going on. The word was sent
forth from Washington that the better
policy would be to have the head3 of
the local depot transferred to outside
stations as the evidence presented to
the War Office was not pleasing to th^
Taft administration, which has been
doing much toward putting all
branches of the service on a strictly
business basis.
The first intimation that there was
laxity, if not criminal carelessness, in
handling the affairs of the Government
in certain branches of the quartermas
ter's department came through a cleric
of the local depot who made an es
pecial trip to Washington to offer evi
dence that the Government was very
glad to receive. The quartermaster
general sent word to th!s city that a
board of inquiry should be appointed
to look into the matter of, draying ex
penses for the army transport serv
ice, and other things of less import
ance. Repeated' complaints were re
ceived from Manila concerning the
quality of goods that were betrnc
shipped to the islands by the Commis
sary Department. Complaint was made
that goods shipped there were of an
inferior quality. It developed that the
complaints did not originate with the
Commissary Department, which has
tried to use care In buying goods, but
with private shipments that have been
received indirectly for Government
employes' uses.

The old days of the army transport
service tangles have their aftermath
In the recent change of officials of the
Quartermaster's department of Califor
nia, and in the subsequent develop
ments following two special secret In
vestigations of the service by officials
appointed as a special board of in
quiry by Secretary of War Taft
through Quartermaster General Hum
phrey at Washington. D. C.
The keynote of the policy of the
quartermaster was: "I want the truth,
and if necessary I will change every
man in the service who has been at
the head of a department that I may
assure the people a fair administra
tion of the services that has to do
with the sending out of ships and the
handling of commissary 'and quarter
master's supplies for the Philippines."
Since this declaration of War De
partment independence there have
been many changes In the depot quar
termaster's office in this city and
there are likely to be more before the
administration gets through with the
handling of evidence that Is now in its
possession.
Several months ago the first court
of inquiry was appointed to investigate
the alleged irregularities that are said
to have occurred through the negli
gence of heads of departments of the
Pacific Coast. This board was com
posed of Major Carroll A. Devol, .de
pot quartermaster; Captain ' Stanley,
now of the Department of California
but at one time the aid to General
Young, and Captain Charles T.' Baker,
assistant depot quartermaster.
"What is the result of the findings ?"
queried the quartermaster general.
"I will have forwarded all testimony
by mall," answered the local depot.

Such a note is beginning to be sound
ed throughout the country. It is the
Irirh Nationalist's reply to Chamber
lain's proposed determination to adopt
the Times' attitude of hostility to Irish
self government in any form.
DUBLIN, Oct. 7.â It has become clear
that if Chamberlain hopes to win the
support of the Irish party for his ns-,
cal campaign he would "better hasten
to conciliate Nationalist opinion with
reference to' home rule. To-day's
Freeman's Journal says: "There will
be a good many protectionists in
America this j'ear who will want to
know why Canadian wheat can come
free into the United Kingdom over
thousands of miles of ocean and yet
cannot cross the border between the
dominion and the republic except at
the price of heavy imposts.
"This situation is not one that either
the Republican party in America or
the Chamberlain party in England can
contemplate with enthusiasm. The toil
ing millions of England have reason to
congratulate themselves that they are
still able to get untaxed wheat and
ficur from foreign countries. It should
be remarked by Irishmen that Cham
berlain's proposed protection could In
no way benefit the agricultural inter
ests of Ireland, as in any event both
wheat and meat would be admitted un
taxed from Australia and Canada."
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON, Oct. 7.â King Leopold of
Belgium was assailed for his policy as
sovereign of the Congo Free State by
E. T. â¢ Morc-11 of England at a public
rreettiDB" this afternoon in connection
with the session of the International
Peace Congress. Morell charged that
the King was personally responsible,
in a large measure, for the cruelties
practiced on the natives of the Congo
Free State in the terrific endeavors of
monopolistic commercial organizations
to obtain from the country all the ivory
and rubber possible.
The King was defended by George
Herbert Head of Cambridge, England,
who submitted that King Leopold had
done all possible to stop the cruelties.
The Government policy in the Congo
was also bitterly denounced by Rev.
William Morrison, for seven years a
missionary in Africa.
The congress to-day accepted a re
port of the Committee on Propaganda,
recommending that the congress in
1903 be held at Luzerne, Switzerland.
One of the first things which the
congress did to-day was to adopt res
olutions, recommending that all na
tions enter into a treaty, insuring, in
case of dispute between countries, that
the differences would be submitted for
settlement to a court created by a
union of all the powers.
A dinner was given to-night at which
the foreign delegates were guests.
Speeches were made by Bishop Perci
val of England, Baroness von Suttener,
Booker T. Washington and others.
"The 1.10b there took nineteen chil
dren and placed them with American
people we know nothing about. They
if fused to listen to any explanation
.ind we are compelled to leave them
and bring the others. We will have
j to the law to get possession
<f them. The little ones we secured at
?.f-rÂ«Â»nci will be taken back to New
York via Houston."
"At Clifton the mob threatened to
lynch me and I did not expect to get
out alive. The babies brought back
fere in a bad way from the excitement
and traveling and the nurses are al
most prostrated. As for myself, I am
mad from head to foot. It is a dis
grace to America. I saw no peace
nfficers there, nothing but mob law.

veloped that he was only newly ar
rived in this country, having come
over from France eleven months ago.
We had the babies left at the homes
selected, which took three days between
the two towns, and were preparing to
leave, when both places were up in
arms over the matter. At Morenci. al
though we had some trouble, we man
aged to convince the people who were
ciamoring that it was a mistake, and
we went out and collected up the ba
bies again, placing them at the hotel.
At Clifton, which is a regular mining
camp, fully r thousand men armed
with revolvers and guns gathered at
the public library and held an indig
nation meeting. They afterward en
tered the rooms of the nurses and in
tuited the women, who have always

organization, told me that Tammany has no
hope of electing Parker. In fact, the organ

strength in the city for the purpose of cap
turing the municipal plums. There is no great
enthusiasm shown by either party, which I
attribute to the fact that the Republicans are
certain of victory and the Democrats know
they have no chance.
At the Republican national headquarters,
where I met Mr. Cortelyou, I found the great
est confidence. During my round* I was nut
slow in discovering that the big gnna of the

GREAT CONFIDENCE IX EAST.
We know very we il that all the steel re
quired In shipbuilding here has to be trans
ported across the continent, and we know that
fuel costs more in San Francisco than at New
port News and In Pennsylvania: and, for niy
part,, I do not wish to see all of the future con
tract work" of the United States navy executed
on the Atlantic seaboard. I think of the hun
dreds of workers. whose homes are In this city
and whoso employment depends on the business
of our private shipbuilding plants; and I think
of the capital invested in those plants; and X
think of the trade of our city In general.
The fiehi for an elsht-hour day in olants
such as the Union Iron Works will be carried
on In Washington until It Is won. So will be
the flaht for enlarging the naval sun factory.
So will be the fight for, establishing a Gov
ernment factory for the manufacture of armor
plate. So will be the fight for giving to the
navy yards the larger share of the Govern
menfe shipbuilding, go will b* the fight for
reasonable control of the trusts. I have Â» no
doubt of It. Time and persistent persuasion
will win- for ub.
Moreover, I have ardently advocated going
further, than the building and repair of our
naval .vessels In the Government's yards;, for
In and- out of Congress I have stood for estab
lishing a Federal armor place factory and for
enlarging the naval gun factory at "Washington.
1 have not been natlsfled to *ee al! the armor of
our .navy manufactured by unscrupulous non
union private concerns, as is now the case,
and I havo not bÂ«en content to Me the Gov
ernment turning over to extortionate ' privats
plants so much of the manufacture of our
naval armament as it has been doing.
I dd not wish to be understood as In favor
of crippling the Union Iron Works, the RIsdon
Iron Works or the Fulton Iron Works. It
has' semed to me Important that they receive
some of the Government's work, whatever may
be or. may become the resources of the navy
yards of the country; and I have stood and now
stand for giving them a fair Â«hare of what
ever contract work the Government withholds
from Its own plants. Accordingly, I spoke and
voted In the House of Representatives for a
return to the 4 per cent "differential"-equal
izing the difference between the cost of manu
facturing ahlDii on the Atlantic coast and the
cost- of manufacturing chip* on the Pacific
CoaÂ»t..
Congressman E. J. Livernash ad
dressed the workmen of the Union
Iron Works during the noon hour yes

In part he said:
The little tlnw we can be together Vo-day
will not liermlt an extsnded discussion of
public aflairs; but, as the men of thjs Union
Iron WorkK have a direct lmere*t in the use
made of the navy yards of / the country. I
shall devote most of my speech to the subject.
Xi.-ither as a mferober of Congress nor other-'
wise have I ever been opposed to the building
or the repair of ships in the navy yards of
the United States. On. the contrary, I have
at. all times been strongly in favor of giving
those yards the major part of the work of our
navy, under conditions preventive of the
abuses which In the long-ago characterized
some of them.

State Convention met here to-day and
nominated a complete State ticket and
Presidential electors, adopted a plat
form of principles and elected the
members at large of the Democratic
State- Committee.
Nathan was chairman of
the convention, and declared that the
prosperity with which certain indus
tries and sections of this country have
for some years been blessed is already
on the wane, and that there is a gen
eral and growing dissatisfaction with
the commercial policies which, with
other causes, are responsible for these
conditions. He said, in conclusion,
that at the present moment the com
mercial outlook for New England Is
darker than at any time since the war
of 1S12.

CHICAGO, Oct. 7. â "There is no
such thing as the 'yellow peril,* of
which we have heard so much," said
Rev. George B. Smythe, secretary of
the Methodist Missionary Society, at
the session of the Rock River Con
ference In the Evanaton-avenue
Church to-day. "The war between
Japan and Russia," he continued, "is
not a religious war. Japan la awak
ening and I would rather trust her
paganism than Russia's so-called
Christianity."
Mr. Smythe. who has spent a score
of years in China and the Orient as a
missionary, told of atrocities on thd*
part of foreign nations, particularly
scoring the Germans and the French.

The Fairbanks special train arrived
in Salt Lake City at 12:15 p. m., and
headed by a brass band Senators Fair
banks and Dolliver and the other mem-
'For my part." he said, "I think the
Republican party has everything to
pain and nothing to lose by the sys
tem. I trust to- the intuitive sense of
the women to catch and appreciate the
wisdom of Republican policies, for
these policies make for the improve
ment of the home as no other policies
can."
The party left here at 9:45 for Salt
Lake City.
SALT LAKE CITY. Utah, Oct. 7.â
As Senator Fairbanks' special train
was preparing to pull out of Brigham
a number of young women, employes
of an adjacent cannery, came up to
shake hands with Senator Fairbanks.
"'How many of you can vote?" asked
Senator Dolliver.
Only c-ne confessed that she was old
enough to exercise the franchise.
"Be sure you vote the Republican
ticket." paid the Senator.
"You can bet your life on that," was
the reply as the train left the station.
At Farmington Senators Fairbanks
and Dolliver made brief speeches from
the rear platform of the Edgemere,
and Senator Fairbanks shook hands
with the people there congregated. In
his speech at that point Fairbanks
spoke of the facility of the Republican
party for government, saying that it
amounts to genius, while he claimed
that, on the other hand, the Democratic
party is absolutely deficient in this re
spect. He urged the people of Utah to
stand by the party capable of best
handling the affairs of the Government,
saying that wise policies must benefit
all sections alike, while poor govern
ment must be equally hurtful to all.
MORMONS HEAR FAIRBANKS.
Senator Dolliver referred in his
speech to the fact that female suffrage
prevails in this State.
PAYS TRIBUTE TO WOMEN.
Senator Fairbanks made an appeal
for the f upport of the Republican ticket.
contending that only by keeping that
party in power could the highest de
gree of prosperity be attained. He made
no mention of the differences existing
among Republicans in this State, nor
did he refer to the question of polyg
amy. The anti-Mormon wing of the
party i?. however, quoting a sentence
from the Senator's speech at Ogden
last night as In support of their posi
tion. The passage is as follows:
""In the final analysis the American
home is the unit of the republic's
strength: that home wherein presides
one mother, where there is gathered
about the hearthstone faithful hearts
filled with love of the American flag
and with adoration for the institutions
of our fathers, which have been com
mitted to our highest and most loyal
keeping."
The Senator's speech here was cor
dially applauded, as were the speeches
of Congressman Smith and Senator
DoMiver.
BRIGHAM. Utah. Oct. 7.â Senator
Fairbanks spoke here this morning on
his arrival from Ogden, at which city
he spent Thursday night. He was ac
companied by Senator Dolliver of Iowa,
Senators Smoot and Kearns of Utah,
Congressman Smith of Iowa and a
large contingent of Utah's leading Re
publicans. The meeting was held in
the opera-house.
Senator Fulton rejoined the party at
Ogden. He had intended leaving for
his home in Oregon last night, but,
failing to get a train, decided to re
main with the Senatorial party for the
present.
A meeting was held in the opera
house here soon after 8 o'clock. Sen
ator Clark presided and speeches were
made by Senators Fairbanks, Dolliver
and Pulton and Representative Smith.
A conspicuous feature in the audience
was a body of forty young ladies, con
stituting, the Evanston Woman's Club
of first voters. The hall was crowded
and thÂ« efeeches were all received
most* favorably.
Senator JDolliver Bpoke briefly, and
speaking of President Roosevelt, Sen
ator Dolliver said:
"We are running a man for President
to whom we had been introduced be
fore he became a candidate. He was
born in New York, but he got away as
soon as he could, and he is the first
man born in that city I ever heard of
who amounted to anything."
He then referred to Judge Parker,
eaying:
"If the Democrats go on lying about
Roosevelt I propose to tell the truth
about Parker.". | / - ;j '
The audience cheered when the Sen
ator expressed the opinion that Utah
had recovered from its "delusion on the
silver question."
After the meeting the Fairbanks par
ty was entertained at luncheon at the
Knutsford Hotel, at the conclusion of
which they left for Evanston, Wyo.
EVANSTON, Wyo., Oct. 7.â This
little city on the extreme western bor
der of Wyoming to-night holds within
its borders six United States Senators.
They are Messrs. Fairbanks, Dolliver,
Fulton, Kearns, Warren and Clark.
This is the home of Senator Clark and
he and Senator Warren, with a num
ber of other Wyoming Republicans,
met. Senator Fairbanks and party in
Utah and came in with them on the
Fairbanks special, which arrived here
shortly, after 7 o'clock.
The meeting was adjourned with
three rousing cheers for Roosevelt and
the Republican party.
McKinlay and Congressman Mc-
Lachlin arrived in San Rafael early
this afternoon and. notwithstanding the
fact that it rained in torrents, they
made an inspection of the water front
of San Rafael Both men were strongly
impressed with the situation, and hope
in the near future to make use of the
vast waterway surrounding this city.
bers of the party were escorted to the
Salt Lake Theater, where Senator Fair
banks addressed one of the largest
crowds seen on the trip' Governor
Heber M. Wells presided at the meet
ing. Besides the immedate members of
the party, seated on the stage with
Senator Fairbanks were Apostles John
Henry Smith and Lyman of the Mor
mon church. In the audience were
many Mormon leaders from all parts
of the country, who are here in attend
ance upon the semi-annual conference
of their church.
In his address Senator Fairbanks
spoke of the stability of Republican
policies, saying they are the same un
der Theodore Roosevelt as they were
under Abraham Lincoln. Not only,
however, should a Republican Presi
dent be elected, but a Republican Con
gress as well. "We can't run the gov
ernment of this country on one wheel,"
he said.
The chairman of the meeting was E.
B. Martinelli. Many prominent citizens
of San Raf#el and Marin County were
seated on the stage as vice presidents.
McKinlay was the first speaker. He
discussed the political issues for an
hour, explaining the doctrines and prin
ciples of the party and recited the
splendid advantages that have accrued
to the nation under Republican ad
ministrations.
He was warmly received, and the
hearty applause given him proved the
sentiments entertained toward him and
justified the claim that Marin 'County's
majority for him next month will ap
proach the thousand mark.
Congressman McLachlan was then
introduced and spoke briefly but forci
bly in behalf of McKinlay. at whose
instance, the speaker said, he had come
up to the Second Congressional Dis
trict to make a personal investigation
of the needs of this section. He said
he had gained much information that
could not be obtained from any amount
of reading. He urged the election of
McKinlay to Congress, advancing un
answerable arguments to Bupport his
requests. McKinlay was given., the
closest attention throughout his speech
and made a deep Impression upon every
one present.
Notwithstanding a heavy downpour,
the people of San Rafael turned out in
large numbers to-night to hear the
political issues discussed by Duncan E.
McKinlay, the nominee for Congress
from the Second District, and James
McLachlan.
The Opera-house was well filled with
an enthusiastic audience, which hearti
ly indorsed the sentiments of the speak
ers, breaking into applause at the men
tion of the names of Roosevelt and
Fairbanks. The enthusiasm was en
hanced by the string music of the
Fifth Regiment band.
Republican sentiment is very strong
in Marin County, and the adherents of
protection and prosperity in San Rafael
took occasion to show their, devotion to
the party. Prior to the opening of the
meeting the streets were illuminated in
a brilliant manner.
United States Senator Thomas R.
Bard, who arrived in the city Thursday
evening, is quartered at the Occidental
Hotel. Yesterday, he conferred, with
BARD MEETS CITIZENS.
The meeting in the evening filled the
opera-house to overflowing, the throng
standing on the stairway to hear the
splendid addresses. <Ex-Congressman
Frank L. Coombs presided and paid a
tribute to the worth and ability of the
party nominee. Enthusiasm was at a
high pitch, and the splendid resume of
national issues given by the principal
speaker received the closest attention,
being frequently interrupted by cheers.
His arguments were clean cut and
forcible, his illustrations appealing to
the audience with striking effect. He
disclaimed any purpose of appealing
for support on his personality, and
placed his candidacy on the broad plane
of party issues and principles. . â¢/ .
Mr. McKinlay was followed by Con
gressman McLachlan, who spoke main
ly on the issue of the tariff and its ef
fect on the industries of the country,
and especially of California. -Facts
within his own knowledge were ad-'
duced to substantiate his claims, and
his able address proved very convinc
ing.
Sentiment in Napa County shows a
strong trend toward McKinlay, who
will poll his entire party strength there
and who will also receive many Demo
cratic votes. A wager of J1000 oh his
election offered by a prominent Demo
crat has been up several' days
without takers. The Democracy Is dis
heartened, as shown by the fact that
but one man from Napa attended the
Fifth Senatorial District Convention in
Vallejo Thursday. The Republicans/on
the other hand, are well organized' and
enthusiastic. Ben Rush, Jhe Republi
can nominee, will carry the district by
an overwhelming majority.
The McKinlay-Belshaw. Republican
Club was organized at Corte Madera
last evening, sixty-four members sign
ing the roll. The officers chosen were
George A. Dodge, president; Messrs. E.
C. Chapman.' J. C Perry and J.v-.W.
Do-lllver, vice presidents, and Charles
J. Wall, . secretary. Speeches.: were
made by Messrs. Dodge, Chapman and
Perry and the meeting adjourned at a
late hour with three rousing cheers for
Roosevelt and sound money. â¢
For the purposes in view the Repub
licans have rented two floors of the
Sacramento Pythian Castle in which
they will hold their meetings. At the
meeting of the 19th inst., one floor of
the castle will be given over to the
ladies of Republican affiliation and
there they will hold a merry social,
winning votes with womanly logic
while they entertain their guests with
a musical programme and refresh
ments.
At the same time their husbands,
sweethearts, fathers and brothers will
be doing politics^in the. good old-fash
ioned way on the other floor. A pro
gramme has been prepared, speakers
have been selected and all looks well
for the success of the venture. Bert
Cavanagh will preside at the men's
meeting and see that the enthusiasm
is kept at the flood. All indications
point to a Republican majority in Sac
ramento of 1000.
The reception tendered Mr. McKinlay
in Napa Thursday was a striking dem
onstration of the sentiment prevailing
at the home of his opponent and a fit
ting evidence of the appreciation given
the worth and ability of the Republican
nominee. Mr. McKinlay, accompanied
by his wife and James McLachlan, ar
rived in Napa before noon arid spent
two hours visiting the Napa State Hos
pital. Upon coming to town Mrs. Mc-
Kinlay Was tendered an informal re
ception by a number of members of the
Ladies' Aid Society of the Presbyterian
church. Mr. McKinlay made a tour of
the tanneries, factories and business es
tablishments of Napa, gaining many
friends during the afternoon.
MEETING IS A BIG ONE.
Interest in the contest in the Second
Congressional District is increasing as
the campaign grows on. Latest reports
show that there is a solid Republican
alignment for Duncan E. McKinlay
and that he is making steady gains.
Sacramento is going to inaugurate an
interesting series of meetings on the
19th inst. on behalf of Roosevelt and
Fairbanks and Mr. McKinlay. These
affairs will be unique in the history of
campaigning in California.
LADIES WILL LEND AID.
The Republican Congressional cam
paign will be enthusiastically opened
at the Alhambra Theater Saturday
evening, October 15. Julius Kahn,
candidate for Congress from the
Fourth, and A. E. Hayes, candidate
from the Fifth District, will address the
meeting, which promises to be not only
interesting from a political stand
point but entertaining as well.
The blare of bands and the crackling
of bonfires will tell the people that the
night for the meeting is at hand. In
addition to the speeches of the candi
dates and others there will be music,
songs and various entertaining feat
ures within the theater and a vote
winning night is anticipated. From
that evening on through the campaign
the Congressional fight will be carried
on with vigor and the Republicans are
confident of reclaiming the Fourth and
Fifth districts. On Wednesday, the
19th inst., Julius Kahn will address the
voters of the Forty-fifth Assembly
District at Steimke Hall. Other dates
of meetings at which the Congressional
nominees will speak have not yet been
announced.

The last vote on amendments took
place at a special election held in De
cember, 1902. Two years will not have
elapsed, therefore, when the November
election occur?.
The association makes no objection
to the amendments, but simply wishes
to have the vote taken legally.
The law provides that constitutional
amendments shall be submitted to the
people for approval not oftener than
once in two years. There is some doubt
as to whether this means the voting
shall not take place oftener than once
in two years or that the Legislature
shall finally ratify amendments only
biennially. The association feels that
the making of amendments to the char
ter is of such an important nature that
a vote should not be taken unless it is
clear that the decision of the people
will be final. 3
At a meeting of the Merchants' As
sociation held yesterday it was decided
that the organization should take a
stand against the submission of the
proposed charter amendments to the
voters at the approaching election. The
legal advisers of the association have
been canvassing the situation for sev
eral weeks and it is their opinion that
there is a doubt about the legality of
holding such an election now. A com
munication setting forth the position of
the city's business men in the matter
will probably be sent to the Board of
Supervisors at an early date.

The American Girl.
WHAT MAKES HER POPULAR.
Tbe American girl is admired and liked
at home and abroad because she is the
happiest, usually tbe healthiest and friend-
liest of girls. She is fond of life and is
alive to everything: beautiful and good in
existence. Mrs. Laogtry has said that the
Americas woman has little to learn from
her English sisters.
Dr. Pierce, the specialist in women's dis-
eases, of Buffalo, N. Y., advises simple ex-
rrcises for women, preferably is the out-
door air. But many_ women are confined
t.> the house asd their household duties or
Iheix business confine* them to poorly ven-
tilated rooms.
If a woman suffers from a headache, a
backache, a sensation of irritability or
twitching and uncontrollable nervousness,
something must be wrong with the head or
back, ste naturally says, but all the time
ihe real trouble very often centers in the
â¢womanly organs. In 9S per cent of cases
the seat of the difficulty is here, and a
woman should take rational treatment for
its cure. Tbe local disorder and inflamma-
tion of the delicate special organs of the
sex ebould be treated steadily and system-
atically. â¢ ,

The Board of Fire Commissioners,
sitting as the Pension Fund Board,
yesterday afternoon heard the claim
of J. D. Harrington, a machinist em
ployed at the Corporation Yard, for
a pension during the period of his ill
ness resulting from injuries caused by
falling from a ladder while at work in
the yard.
The Pension Board decided that al
though the claim might be a just one,
the status of Harrington as a mem
ber of the Fire Department was not
quite clear, so the case was referred
to the City Attorney.
Harrington showed that he was a
member of the relief companies or
ganized to supplement the main force
on the occasion of a general alarm.
This caused a joking refernce by Com
missioner Parry to "phantom compa
nies," whereupon President Boyne en
tered Into a tirade against one of the
afternoon papers, that had accused
him of organizing the so-called com
panies.
The widow of Edward F. Dougherty
was granted a pension by the Board
of Fire Commissioners. Dougherty
was the engineer on engine No. 37,
and was fatally injured while on his
way to a flre on August 13, 1902. He
died September 7, 1903, and a question
was brought up as to the reading of
the- law. The Commissioners decided,
however, to allow the pension.
Acting Lieutenant F. H. Kenny was
before the Commissioners on charges
of absence from duty without permis
sion and failure to obey orders. . He
left his post at a downtown flre, and
was not heard ; from for a week. It
was subsequently learned that he had

ST. PETERSBURG, Oct. 7.â The
question of sending the Baltic Sea fleet
to the Far East by way of Cape Horn
is advocated by a strong party at the
admiralty on the ground t,hat after
passing the Strait of Magellan their
progress could not be dogged and re
ported by cable. The colliers could
rendezvous in the South Seas at some
Pacific island. The main risk would
be that in the vast stretch the vessels
might be beaten off their track and the
danger of a serious breakdown of some
of the ships, although the transport
Kamchatka is equipped with ap
pliances for making extraordinary re
pairs.
The selection of this route would be
tantamount to a decision not to reach
Vladivostok in the spring, a long voy
age requiring economical speed for at
least four months.
New Route Is Proposed for Russia's
Baltic Fleet.

NEW YORK. Oct. 7.â Rumors that a
plot was on foot to destroy a public
school in the upper East Side to-day
caused a riot of several hundred Ital
ian mothers of the pupils requiring
a force of police reserves to quell the
disturbance. The women, who feared
that their offspring were to be de
stroyed, stormed the school entrance
and had not a policeman and the jan
itor slammed and locked the heavy
doors in their faces the mob would
have stormed the building! A dozen
did get inside and excited the pupils
with shrill cries. Those on the outside
joined in the uproar and the situation
was rapidly becoming serious when a
patrol wagon loaded with reserves
reached the scene. Finally the women
were driven away, end after the 1900
children in the school had been quieted
they were sent home.

BUTTE, Mont., Oct. 7.â According to
officers engaged in investigating tha
assassination of Robert Gates, the well
known Northern Montana trapper, who
was found dead on the shores of Swan
Lake with two bullet holes in hia
breast, the murderer 13 oelieved to be
Thomas O'Reilly, one of the alleged
assassins of Dr. Cronln. the Chicago
millionaire. O'Reilly, who was known
as an artist, was the only one of tha
alleged murderers of Cronin to escapa
the officers, and has been a fugitive
ever since.
Deputy Sheriff Jack Donahua no-w
declares his belief that O'Reilly, alias
Riley, is the fugitive wanted In tha
noted Chicago case. O'Reilly leads tha
life of a hermit, being suspicious of
strangers, and is always armed. Hla
artistic abilities are a matter of com
ment among his neighbors. Rlley had
a quarel with Gates over some fishing
tackle and swore vengeance upon thai
trapper.
Gates was shot from ambush as ha

YOUNG WIFE WHOSE BRIEF
WEDDED BLISS HAD A SUDDEN
AND PATHETIC ENDING.
Mrs. Modica is a daughter of J. B.
Carrington of 431 Bartlett street, this
city, and was a sister of the late Car
roll Carrington, well remembered as a
writer and editor. Frank B. Modica
was 30 years of age, president of the
Harbeson-Modlca Manufacturing Com
pany, and well known in Kansas City.
His mother and two sisters reside in
Chicago, and the body will be taken
there for burial. Modica was taken ill
at Salt Lake City while on his journey
East and died at the residence of E.
C. Minsener in Kansas City shortly
after his arrival there.
The story of the meeting of Mls3
Clorine Carrington and Frank B.
Modica, and their speedy courtship and
marriage was one of the romances of
Conclave week.. Miss Carrington, who
was but 19 years of age, was intro
duced to Sir Knight Modica on a Mar
ket-street car during the merry days
of the Conclave. They at once became
fast friends and the old, old story was
told again. Love at first sight it cer
tainly must have been, for each came
to the conclusion that without the
other this world would be a wilderness.
Cupid must have worked overtime, for
on September 19 a license was issued
and Justice of the Peace Dunn spoke
the words which made them husband
and wife. A wedding breakfast was en
joyed at the Palace Hotel, where the
couple spent their brief honeymoon.
It was but a few days after the mar
riage that Modica was called East on
business. His wife bade him good
by, arranged to m'eet him in the East
and with a parting kiss wjshed him
godspeed. It was the final parting.
The au revoir proved to be farewell
forever. When the bride of a few
weeks stepped from the train at Kan
sas City expecting to meet her husband
she was informed that she was a
widow.
Few brides have had the unfortunate
experience of Mrs. Frank B. Modica,
who met the man fate seemed to have
chosen for her, married him after a
brief courtship, was separated from
him owing to business engagements,
journeyed East to join him, and In
stead of being clasped in his loving em
brace was informed that he was dead.

"There are twenty gangs of riveters
working on the battleship, which is

the riveters late yesterday afternoon
must have dropped a hot rivet, or per

landed in the sawdust. A flre ensued
and continued to smoulder until dis

to the ship amounts to nothing."
It was erroneously reported last night
that the fire had occurred on the

last night on the battleship Kansas, in

"There was positively nothing sus
picious about the fire on the Kansas.
As a matter of fact, the blazes are not

The fire occurred in a lot of sawdust

DUE TO AN ACCIDENT
The first board of inquiry merely
went into the preliminary details, but
the second sitting resulted In an order
for sweeping: changes of employes. The
transfers do not necessarily mean that
every man assigned to another post is
under suspicion, but simply that the
administration is determined to have
the transport service clear of any
scandal.
The resignation of Harry T. Scott,
purveyor of the army transport ser
vice, was not due to the difficulties that
resulted 'from his recommendation of
certain men for deckhands on a trans
port. Scott had, several months prior
to the trial of the case, arranged to
become a partner in the Western "Ware
house Company. The true inwardness
of the employment cases lies in the in
vestigation that is soon to be con
ducted from Washington, concerning
which, however, nothing Is officially
known at the local army headquarters
or by the quartermaster.
Certain witnesses, perhaps reliable
and perhaps otherwise, have reported
that jobs on transports have been for
sale for months past and that the
money was not demanded by employ
ment agents, either. Another question
for investigation, and it is now In the
hands of the War Department, is the
bleeding of soldiers and officers by
transport employes, who have made a
practice of "holding out" food provided
by the Government to which the army
is entitled and selling it to the men.
Captain Charles Baker will have
charge of the quartermaster's depot at
Manila. Clerk Knox has been dis
charged,' ostensibly for Intoxication,
and a wholesale transfer of men has
been going on. Though not the slight
est shadow of suspicion can be cast
upon Depot Quartermaster Devol, in
the general shakeup that is to come It
is expected that he will be promoted to
an Eastern station.
An Eastern man is now on his way
here to take Captain Baker's place and
he Is said to have authority to 'ook
into certain papers purporting to be
copies of correspondence and books
that show a cleverly devised system of
"stand-in" and "graft" that may seri
ously affect the records of some of the
Government employes and which has
cost the Government hundreds of thou
sands of dollars. U'-.v
A clean sweep of the local transport
and quartermaster's service Is ex
pected.
PRELIMINARY QUERIES.
clerk named Knox and a third clerk
whose name is not given in the Wash
ington records, concerning the con
tract of the Morton Transfer Company
with the depot quartermaster and the
chief commissary for hauling. It ap
pears that when the contract was let
to Morton some time ago to haul mer
chandise, household goods and ma
chinery to and from the transport
deck at Folsom street to the Presidio
and elsewhere, there were several bid
ders, who put in figures for transpor
tation at a stated price "per ton." The
Morton figure was for so much "per
haul."
Bills for amounts, running well into
the thousands, accrued and are part of
the transportation records as compiled
for the first army transport Investiga
tion by Inspector General Chamberlain
and Colonel Maus. When the com
plaint was made to Quartermaster Gen
eral Humphrey at Washington it was
said that through the connivance of
certain clerks it had been made possible
for teams to haul and rehaul gocis â
light loads at thatâ for which good
prices were paid by the department.
Household furniture is said to have
been moved to the Presidio one day
and back the next and trucks that were
capable of carrying tons were not bur
dened with more than a few hundred
pounds.
Merchandise was carted from pillar
to post, so the report goes, and was
never allowed a peaceful stacking-up
for any length of time in any one stor
age place.

TSINGTAU, Oct. 7. â The German
steamer -Progress, which left here
twenty-six days ago with a general
cargo consigned to Vladivostok, re
turned from that port to-day and re
ported that she found It easy to elude
the Japanese ships in that vicinity. She
reported that a number of large ships
have been there recently with stores of
coal and ammunition. The city of
Vladivostok is Quiet, but the Russians
seem depressed over their land and se.a
reverses.
Vladivostok Is being heavily fortified,
the harbor Is being mined and repairing
of the damaged ships 13 going on. It
is believed that it will be impossible to,
put the armored cruiser Rossia in a
seaworthy condition.
It is reported in Vladivostok that
General Kuropatkin has been very ill
and unable to personally command his
army since the battle of Liaoyang.
Russian officers at Tsingtau are re
sponsible for the statement that ammu
nition and guns from the protected
cruiser Diana have reached Port Arthur
from Saigon. The Germans here do not
believe the story.
It Is claimed that the expected dash
of the Port Arthur fleet has been frus
trated by the terrific storms which have
prevailed this week.
The British collier Howick Hall is
here, discharging a cargo of coal to
the German ship Emma. The latter is
expected to make an attempt to reach
Port Arthur within a few days.

from a third-story window. The flre
started in the kitchen of the hotel,
which was a frame building. The
guests and boarders were aroused with
great difficulty. The three men who
lost their lives were boarders and un
married.
At a short session of the House of
Deputies the committee on the admis
sion of new dioceses recommended
that the missionary district of Mon
tana be admitted into union with the
general convention as a full-fledged
diocese. The recommendation was re
ferred to the House of Bishops. In the
joint session many missionary reports
were submitted regarding the work of
the last three years. All were gener
ally satisfactory, with the exception of
that part of the Board of Missions' re
port which stated that a number of
diocese had refused to contribute
their share of the fund assessed under
the apportionment plan.
The total missionary receipts during
the year from all sources, save lega
cies, were $657,000, an increase over the
preceding year of $19,000. The appor
tionment for last year was $630,000 and
the receipts to apply upon It were
$413,000, showing a probable shortage
of $217,000. The board, however, is not
that sum in debt, but merely fell short
that amount in its requests.
The Archbishop of Canterbury and
several American Bishops addressed a

The latest advices said that the fortress
had sufficient ammunition and provi

out nine months.

Up to this hour the War Office has

front.
The Admiralty continues -without
news or the reported sea fight on! Port
Arthur, as well as of the Toklo report
of the wrecking and damaging of Rus
sian warships at Port Arthur by the
Japanese land batteries. As a portion
of the squadron has been going: out
occasionally to bombard the Japanese
land positions, the possibility that some
of the Russian vessels may have been
damaged by the Japanese batteries is
admitted.
The Admiralty officially announces
that the Baltic rieet will be ready to
Ball as soon as the battleship Orel and
the cruisers Oleg, Zemtchug and
Izumrud, which sailed from Cronstadt
to-day, arrive at Reval. The Ice breaker
Ermak will accompany the fleet.

to send the fleet to the Far East by way
of Cape Horn has been decided nega
tively.
The Admiralty Is unable to furnish
information concerning the two Rus
sian ships reported to be cruising in

any Russian ships have been sighted
in Torres Straits, or if any Russian
ships are now there, they must have

IX>AN'S PILLS.
TO BE DEPENDED ON
Because It Is the Experience of a
San Francisco Citizen and
Can Readily Be In-
vestigate!
A stranger lost in a large city
would place far more dependence on
the directions given him by a local
resident than the guidance of another
stranger like himself. This is a nat-
ural consequence of experience. It's
like a ship in a strange port â a trusty
pilot, familiar with the harbor, is al-
ways called upon to bring her safely
to her moorings. So it is with in-
dorsement. We doubt the sayings
of people living at distant points be-
cause we can't investigate; but pub-
lic expression of local citizens can be
depended on, for 'tis an easy matter
to prove it. Evidence like the fol-
lowing is beyond dispute:
B. Edgecomb of 934 Mission street
says: "I knew from the condition
and the action of the secretions from
my kidneys that those organs were
not doing their work completely or
as satisfactorily as I wished. I
tried different medicines, but without
any effect, or, if any, it was so un-
appreciable that I could not notice it. 'â¢
It was different with Doan's Kidney
Pills. They do not act on the bow-
els, but act directly upon the kid-
neys, soothing, strengthening and i

Five years ago a brother, Halleck V.
Deming, who had been a life long asso- |
elate in business, was found dead in j
1 bed when a daughter went to call him :
! for breakfast one morning. But his
I ending was due to heart disease.
! Thursday evening Deming played
I cards in his room with his brother,
Joseph V. Deming, and was in buoyant |
j spirits when they separated at 10
I o'clock. While he was two years more
â¢ than three score and ten, his age did
j not weigh upon him. He was planning
i to build a new home near the park and
i have the residence at 748 Ellis street,
which the family has occupied many
years, refitted Into an apartment-house.
Tall buildings had arisen on either side
of the old home, and to Deming the
surroundings became undesirable. He
was warmly attached to his home life,
and with his brother happily discussed
idealistic plans for a more commodious
! house and a pleasanter environment.
In 1854 the three brothers came to
! California from Iowa and for some
years engaged in mountain packing in
! Northern California and Southern Ore
! gon, their headquarters being at Yreka.
I But in their youth, first in Indiana and
I then in Iowa, they had learned the
| milling trade, and they seized their op
j portunity in California. In I860 they
i started milling on a small scale In this
i city. Success followed their careful
S methods, and they next founded the
! great Capitol Mills. A fourth partner
i was at this time taken in, and the
j company was organized as the Dem
ing-PalmerMIllingCompany. Gradually
I their operations were extended, until
I mills were built in several cities â Fres
i no, Loa Angeles, Seattle, Tacoma and
'Â¦â¢ Portland. Palmer retired, and then the
concern, that ranked as one of the big-
I gest business institutions on the coast.
! fell into the hands of the three broth
| ers.
But the death of Halleck Deming in
1SS9, in breaking up the partnership.
j caused the surviving brothers to retire
! from active affairs. The mills were sold
, to the Sperry Company and stock was
| taken in that corporation. The last
! few years of Edwin Orr Demlng's life
â¢ were those of ease and enjoyment of an
i estate valued at over $500,000.
He married in 1866 Miss Clara Roh
ner. and besides the widow there sur
vive the daughters. Misses Alice and
Adelaide Deming and Mrs. Arthur H.
j Smith, and a son, Edwin O. Deming,
who is connected with the American
Milling Company.
The Coroner's inquest will be held
to-day and the funeral on Sunday.
Edwin Orr Demingr. one of the found
era of the Capitol Flour Mills, pioneer
and capitalist, was found dead from
asphyxiation when his wife went to call
him for breakfast yesterday morning.
The Jet. from which the deceased had
removed the tube of a drop lamp be
fore he retired, was wide open, and the
circumstances indicate that he forgot
to turn off the gas. Any theory of sui
cide is regarded as absolutely unten
able.

NEW YORK. Oct. 7. â R- G. Dun's
weekly review of trade will say to
morrow: With the crops almost b-e- i
yond danger, prices of securities at the j
highest point since May. 1503, acd idle ;
machinery resuming In factories and j
mills that have been closed for j
months, the business outlook grows i
steadily brighter. By far the best Â¦
feature of the situation is the confi- '
dence manifested by an increased di*- j
P'-sftion to provide for future require
ments. This Ls by no means general,
but it is noticed at pig iron furnaces. |
woolen mills and among dealers *at j
widely s-eparated points, particularly j
those located In the agricultural sec- j
tions.
Mercantile collections are also more j
prompt and railway earnings for the j
month of September were 3.S per cent ;
larger than in the same month last I
year, while foreign commerce at this \
pcint for the last week shows an in- i
crease of 11,501,208 in imports and ]
{410,748 in exports as compared with;
a year ago. Dispatches from the lead- 5
ing cities are almost unanimous in tell- <
ir.g of improved conditions.
Hides have shown unusual activity ',
at a generally higher level of prices-
Failures in the United States num- \
ber 222 against 223 las: week. 225 the j
preceding week and 23 S In the corre- :
sponding week last year. Failures in
Canada number 25 against 15 last j
week, 30 in the preceding week and ,
17 last year.
Bradstreet'a to-morrovr will say: j
Popular estimates of leading crop !
yields continue to enlarge. Corn has |
passed out of danger of serious frost \
damage in the West and distribution,
both at wholesale and retail, expands !
as cooler weather approaches. Addi- |
tional favorable features are the con- !
tinuance of the good tone In pig iron, |
freer buying by railways of material Â¦
and rolling stock, and heavy general i
crop movements helping collections â¢
North and South.
While the buying of dry goods, j
hardware, groceries, shoes and clothing j
continues of good volume, particularly j
in the West, conservative influences find j
reflection In small but frequent orders, i
calculated to meet necessities. The
transportation movement is heavy, and
railways earnings show an expanding I
tendency, the gain for September
promising to be 6 per cent over 1S03.
There are some flaws in the situa
tion which stamp this as 'an off year i
when compared -with previous periods!
of great prosperity. Relatively most j
activity in current distribution, wheth- '|
I er of dry goods, shoes, clothing, lum- j
I ber, hardware or building material, j
exists in the West and Northwest Â¦
; Cooler weather is needed In the South
to stimulate activity. Hides are strong- !
: ly held.

The Croton local was but 200 feet
away and the engine, about fifty feet
north of a block signal. Jumping to
the Hwitch mechanism, he dropped the
lever that worked the arm of the sig
nal which was showing the green light
and instantly the danger signal flashed
before the eyes of the locomotive en
gineer, who had Just caught the Â¦ red
glare as his cab passed the signal
post. At once he reversed his engine
and put down the air brakes, but his
speed had hardly slackened percepti
bly, when he struck the automobile.
The train came to a stop In a distance
of about Â£00 feet.
On the train was Health Commission
er Thomas Darlington, who took
charge of the work of caring for the
injured. The locomotive engineer was
arrested, but released on his own re
cognlzance.
Several persons. Including two po
licemen, saw the automobile rushing
down Jerome avenue. They shouted a
warning, but it was too late. With no
apparent slackening of speed, the big
car crashed through the fence, cleared
a dirt embankment, extending about
flve feet above the stone retaining
wall and then, clearing the wall, made
a sheer drop of twenty-five feet to the
railroad track. In its descent the car
half turned and several of its occu-.
pants were spilled out. When it struck
Noyes, Bella Perez and Madge Corco
ran were thrown on the track, the oth
*-t% failing to the side r>f the rails.
They were stunned and bleeding and
trying to recover themselves when they
heard the roar of the train and then
followed a frightful crash. Noyes was
caught in the wreckage of the car and
toseed up with it on the pilot of the
engine. His body was Â«till there when
th** train -.vas brought to a stop. Madge
Corcoran was dragged by her long au
tomobile coat, which caught on the
Kmaahed car, for a distance of 200 feet,
and when the cloth gave way she fell
to the track only to be cut in two
at the waist by the wheels of the en
gine. The whole train passed over her
body. IJella Perez was dragged about
fifty feet and then thrown to one side.
The tower man, about a hundred
feet north of Jerome avenue, heard
the automobile as it broke through the
fence, and. running to his window, saw
the car strike the track.
The Injured are:
Unidentified woman, severe scalp
wound. lac-irations of the face and body
and general contusions and possible in
ternal Injuries: Moses SpJess, fracture
f/i the ja-w, general contusions; Jean
nfrtte Davis, shock and slight contu
sions; Charles Doran, 23, shock and
Â¦light contusions; Emma Perez, sister
of Bella Perez, shock and hysteria;
Thomas Marpbr. injuries slight.
The party was returning to the Riv
erside Casino from a trip to Mount
VernotL. Allen Noyes, the chauffeur,
had intended turning from Jerome ave
nue into the approach of the McComb
dam bridge to cross to Manhattan.
Whether h* knew of the short exten
sion on Jerome avenue beyond One
Hundred and Sixty-first street or not
will never be known. The corner at
that point is brilliantly lighted, but the
extension leading to the edge of the
embankment above the New York Cen
tral tracks Is pa%-ed with brick and the
car tracks run down to a picket fence
ar the edge.

ing, published by the Federal Gov
ernment. In 1&02 there were in ex
istence in the United States 11*,6T1
wells and the gross output, reckoned
In barrels of forty-two gallons each,
was %5, 275,202 barrels, worth 171.237,
72Â». In 1302 there were drilled 615
unproductive wells, owned by 206 in
dividuals. The aggregate coat of thfrse
unproductive wells was 11,691,056.
Efnee 1900. according to the Fed
eral statistic*, the capitalization rep
resented by speculative oil companies
haji amounted to at least J600,000,000.
A large amount of stock has been Is
sued by such companies in Texas. Cali
fornia, Colorado, Louisiana and Ken
tucky. The capitalization of 2&S in
corporated companies was reported to
the Government.
The rtOcka of thÂ«? companies that re
ported amounted in total to tZ24,l^.-

had the largest outstanding amounts.
There were several 8tateÂ« that made
no returns. Of $C,71'J,2S6 of bonds is
sued $1,636,000 were credited to Califor
nia and \\,'*Z'j, f >'s\ to Texas. The pro
duction of crud* petroleum in thÂ«
United States in 1902, amounting to
Ki,275,?-02 barrels, was nearly equal to
the output of Russia and all other oil
producing countries of the world com
bined.
MILLIONS IN TANKS.
There was Invested at the end of
the year 1902 the very large sum of
$2^0,000,000 In wells and tankage. The
largest number of tanks In any StatÂ«
Is In Pennsylvania, the total for that
State being 20,223. Ohio has between
11.000 and 12,000 tanks; West Virginia
about the same number. A noteworthy
fact appears !n the report, which la
that the great numbers of small re
neries that formerly were scattered
through many Ftatea - have disap
peared and the business of refining pe
troleum has been transferred to hu^e
plant* at points near New York,
Philadelphia, Baltimore, Cleveland,
Buffalo, Whiting, Ind., Port Arthur in
Texas and Point Richmond on the
east shore of the bay cf Han Francisco.

REFUSES DEED TO FARM
TO THE MAX WHO WON IT
FRESNO. Oct. 7.â W. C. Wilkinson
of Laton has won a $7500 ranch from
A. H. Liese on a raffling scheme, but
he cannot get a deed to the property.
He threatens to take the matter into
the courts and have the property con
fiscated by the State. Liese, who was
formerly a Santa Fe conductor with
his home in this city and who is now
living in Oakland, sold tickets at $1
each for a thirty-five-acre ranch, sup
posed to be in Kern City, Monterey
County. It was advertised that the
person holding the number corre
sponding to the one winning the first
prize in the lottery drawing. August 13
would win the ranch. Wilkinson held
the winning ticket, but when he
claimed the ranch Liese "wrote him
that he had no rights in the courts as
it was a game of chance.
Wilkinson, however, has dug up an
old statute which provides for the con
fiscation of such property to the
State.

SEATTLE, Oct. 7.â At 2 o'clock this
afternoon, thirteen minutes before the
scheduled time, the battleship Nebras
ka left her ways at Moran Brothers'
shipyard in this city and slid gracefully
and majestically into the waters of
Puget Sound. The launching was en
tirely successful and no hitch marred
the proceedings. The only reason the
vessel was launched ahead of time was
that by a slight miscalculation the
poppet (a wooden brace) at the bow was
raising the vessel too high, and in the
opinion of experts it was better that
the supports be knocked away without
delay.
Fully 50.000 people viewed the cere
monies and saw the big vessel slip Into
the water. She created but a very small
wave as Ehe took her maiden plunge
and floated out gently and gracefully.
Naval men who viewed the launching
stated that it was the most successful
they ever saw. â¢
The Nebraska weighs more than any
vessel ever before launched for the
United States navy. Immediately after
the launching the big Alaska liners
that hovered about her, with decks
black with excursionists, looked dimin
utive beside her.
Miss Mary Main Mickey, the daugh
ter of Governor Mickey of Nebraska,
christened the vessel.

PORTLAND. Oct. 7.â Law officers of
two States are on the lookout for Lieu
tenant Thomas M. Boone of the Nine
teenth Infantry. While under arrest at
Vancouver Barracks. Wash., Boons
broke guard and fled, It Is believed,
across the Canadian border.
Whlla stationed at Fort Lawton. the
lieutenant was a frequent visitor at
Seattle. During a round of gayety he
created a sensation in a theater. Facts
concerning the trouble were sup
pressed at the time, as It was thought
Boone would be punished by the mili
tary authorities. He was brought to
the headquarters of the Department of
the Columbia, at Vancouver Barracks,
where it was expected a court-martial
would be held, but before the military
could be convened, Lieutenant Boone
made his escape.
It is believed the truant officer head
ed for Seattle, where he remained sev
eral days without being arrested.
While there he spent considerable time
In the society of a woman who left the
ctly shortly after he did. It Is believed
heÂ» crossed the line to British Colum
bia, where he would be free from ar
rest, as his offense, the principal feat
ure of which is desertion from the
army, is not of a nature to permit of
his being extradited.
Boone rose from the ranks, having
been commissioned three years ago.
He is said to have been a model sol
dier before his elevation to the dignity
of an officer.
WOODLAND, Oct. 7.â During an

pend upon electricity for power are
making arrangements to use steam and

The lightning was accompanied by a

age to grapes, which were already ma
terially injured by the September rains.
AUBURN, Oct. 7.â Six inches of rain

SANTA ROSA, Oct. 7.â Gil P. Hall, a
Petaluma attorney and hotel man, had
a lively scrap there this morning with
Officer Pat Mego.
The details of the fight differ, Hall
contending that the policeman attacked
him without provocation, while Mego
alleges that while he was passing Hall
on the streets the latter made a move
ment as if to draw a weapon. Fearing
an attack he clubbed Hall with the
butt end of his revolver, inflicting sev
eral scalp wounds. Hall's hat broke
the force of the blows and saved him
from severe injuries. The headgear
was battered to pieces.
Trouble had been brewing between
the men for more than a year and the
bad feeling that has existed has caused
the belligerents to watch each other's
every move. To-day when Mego saw
a movement that did not look right to
him he started in to secure an advan
tage. Hall was unarmed and finally
ran from his assailant.
Hall will take the matter before the
Board of Trustees at their next meet
ing. Mego has been engaged in fights
before in Petaluma, but has a good rec
ord as a policeman. He has been on
the force there a number of years.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 7.â Although an
official funeral, the services in St.
John's Church to-day over the body of
the late Henry C. Payne, Postmaster
General, were marked by impressive
simplicity. Official Washington filled
the nave of the church and brilliant as
were the uniforms of the representa
tives of the army, navy and marine
corps, the solemnity of the scene was
only enhanced by the sharp contrast
of color with the deep mourning of the
family and personal friends of the dead
Cabinet officer.
With Mrs. Payne sat President and
Mrs. Roosevelt, both in deep mourn
ing. The entire right side of the
church was occupied by the officials of
the Postofflce Department, headed by
Robert J. Wynne, the acting Post
master General. The diplomatic corps,
the chiefs of the bureaus of the Navy
Department, the commandant of the
marine corps, members of the Supreme
Court, Senators and Congressmen and
other officials filled the remaining
space.
The funeral party was met at the
door by the Rev. .Roland Cottonfalth,
rector of St. John's, and his assistants.
The procession formed at the tran
script door, the rector leading the way
and reading from the burial service erf
the Episcopal church. The casket was
borne to the chancel by eight uniform
ed postal carriers. After them walked
the pallbearersâ Secretary Hay, Secre
tary Hitchcock and Secretary Wilson,
the only members of the Cabinet who
were able to reach Washington for the
funeral.
Mrs. Payne entered the church sup
ported by Charles S. Jones and his
sister, Miss Louise Jones, the nephew
and niece of Mrs. Payne, and followed
by a few personal friends.
The service was read by Rev. Mr.
Smith and his assistant. Rev. Mr. Dun
lap, the only alteration in the regular
order of service being the offering of a
special prayer for Mrs. Payne. The
hymns sung during the service were
"Lead, Kindly Light," and "Jesus,
Lover of My Soul." For the reces
sional, the vested choir sang "Hark,
Hark, My Soul." The selections were
made by Mrs. Payne and are her fa
vorite hymns. -
The chancel was fragrant with flow
ers sent by friends from all over the
country. The only flowers on the cas
ket were those of Mrs. Payne, a largÂ«
sheaf of Faster lilies, a wreath of
white roses and carnations from the
President and Mrs. Roosevelt, and a
cluster of violets, gardenias and palms,
the offerings of Miss Jones.

UNKNOWN MAN SHOOTS
HIMSELF IN OAKLAND
OAKLAND, Oct. 7. â Denial is made
by the four daughters of Xelson
Bump in papers filed with the County
Clerk to-day cf the charge made by
their stepmother, Mrs. Sarah Bump,
of having unduly influenced their
father against the wife when he made
his will. Bump died a year ago. leav
ing an estate valued at about $50,000.
Mrs. Bump, dissatisfied with her share
of the estate, brought, suit to contest
the will and alleged that her husband
had been unduly influenced against
her by the daughters, her stepchil
dren. It Is this charge which the
daughters now formally deny.
Children of Xelson Bump Say He
Made Will Without Their
Assistance.
The death certificate of the Reese child was
signed by Dr. Brown, a reputable physician,
and on the strength of that document I issued
the burial permit. The certificate asserts that
death was due to phosphorous poisoning and
I am satisfied that that was correct. I did
not deem it was a case for the Coroner to
investigate, as the cause of the child's death
was apparent and there was nothing further
to investigate. Coroners are relics of past
agea and expensive to the poor man. Every
inquest costs the taxpayers no less than S25
and what are the resulting benefits? I do
not recall an Inquest in Alameda County in
Blv years that recompensed the taxpayers for
what it cost. Reputable physicians can be
depended upon to give the cause of death and
the Coroner accomplishes but little, if any,
more. I know of m6re than one instance
where verdict* were brought In that were not
In accordance with the circumstances attend
ing the death of the person upon whom the
inquest was held. If such things can be
what is the use of Coroners' investigations?
Deputy Coroner Fowler asserts that
he was acting within his sphere as an
undertaker when he buried the Reese
child. He affirms that after Dr. Brown
signed the death certificate and Dr.
Stidham issued the burial permit he
proceeded legally in conducting the
funeral. Dr. Brown is at present out
of the city. >"-.:'
ALAMEDA. Oct. 7.â Health Officer
Dr. L. W. Stidham believes that Cor

the physician in talking of the case of

died Tuesday from phosphorous poison

was buried Wednesday by Deputy Cor

OAKLAND, Oct. 7. â Attorneys rep
resenting Alexander Barrie cleared
the way to-day for a hearing of his
divorce suit without regard to tech
nicalities by withdrawing Barrie's de
murrer to a cross-complaint made by
his wife, who contests the action.
Barrie, a commercial traveler *j of
Berkeley, was sued for divorce a year
ago. His wife charged him with
making the home atmosphere such as
to corrupt the morals of their young
daughter. Fred "Wade, a nephew,
with also a niece of Barrie residing
in the home, was implicated in Mrs.
Barrie's charges of wrong doing
against her husband.
The woman declared that Barrie
and Wade procured her incarceration
in an asylum, when, as she alleged,
she was , perfectly sane. Judge Og
den denied her a divorce. Barrie
promptly brought suit for divorce, al
leging cruelty. . His wife responded
with a cross-complaint, charging him
with unfaithfulness. -His demurrer to
this cross-complaint was filed some
time ago, but was withdrawn to-day,
it being Barrie's purpose to permit
the case to be tried without giving at
tention to the technicalities.

WITHDRAWS DEMURRER
TO ITIS WIFE'S SUIT
SAYS CORONERS
ARE USELESS
Mrs. ' Eddy's order" has 'been! discussed by
our .members with relation | to Its possible ef
fect, on the club, \Of. course there, have been
resignations aince the, law was promulgated
but ' I irnist ! confess .; I . have not â¢ bt*>n Â¦ able to
trace the cause of withdrawal . to the - order
though it is quite -possible 'that if. has had
it* effect. on Â¦ 60me.. Christian Scientists' Our
membership is close to fiOQ and Â¦ there are
changes consjantjy. The subject has. been one
of considerable interest. ; however/ and no doubt
women's clubs generally, have given it thought.
This edict la a by-law of the church and
relates to men as well as to women; in fact,
the law includes all members of our church.
I have heard that; several members of tha
Ebell Club and- other clubs of have al
ready resigned. The "law 'of the church la
plain and each' member must 'decide for him
Â¦elf.
Mrs. J. B. Hume, president r of the
Ebell Society, said to-nightr- .
I find that the majority favor Mrs. Eddy's
'action. It has long been noted that the grow
ing interest in clubs and organizations outside
the church and home, and especially those
clubs which segregate the sexes, have sup
ported the growing tendency to disunion in
the church and home. â¢ ââ¢ â¢ The action of
the Christian Science ' Church Is not Intended
to depreciate in any degree the good accom
plished by fraternal orders, but simply points
to another way of doing It. The Christian
Science Church, however, does not propose to
dictate terms to other denominations- nor to
interfere In any way with the fraternal or
ganizations and clubs; it only asks the priv
ilege of accomplishing within Itself tha ends
for which .such .organizations are Intended,
thereby unifying the motives and efforts of its
members.
Elmer McBurney said:
That there h'as been &> resignation of
members from the Ebell Society is the
understanding of â¢, Elmer McBurney,
temporarily filling the place of the Rev.
F. J. Fluno, as head of the Christian
Science Church of Oakland. So far
: as the leaders are concerned they de
fend Mrs. Eddy's dictum and assert
that it is entirely consistent with the
general tendencies of the teachings.
McBurhey is borne out In his state
ments as to withdrawal of Christian
Scientists from \ interdicted clubs by
Mrs. D. C. Borland, a member of the
Ebell, 1 who says several members have
retired in accordance with the order
rather . than to stand against the
church " of their belief. ., i
The . direction to the Scientists ap
pears in a 'recently issued church man
ual as one* of the by-laws adopted by
the general board of directors. It is
set forth under a caption "Church Or
ganization Ample." The publicity
given the rule and the effect it must
have in compelling faithful members to
choose between their club or their
church has aroused wide discussion in
the church, and among the clubs where
Christian Scientists have been en
rolled. Here Is an opinion from Alfred
Farlow of Boston, Mass., touching the
much-agitated by-law:
OAKLAND. Oct. 7.â "Members of
the mother . church shall not be made
members of clubs or organizations, the
Freemasons excepted, which shall ex
clude either sex or are not named in
the manual of the mother church. God
separates the tares from the wheat to
garner the latter in his storehouses."
Such is the edict that has been Issued
by the % Christian Scientists of the
United States at the instance of Mary
Baker Eddy, acknowledged head of the
cult. Promulgation of the order has
stirred the women's clubs of this city
to the centers. Though the movement
toward withdrawal of members has not
been sufficiently strong to warrant se
rious consideration as to status, there
â¢has been no little discussion among the
club women, as it is known there are
many such who are affiliated with the
Christian Scientists.

Perhaps the moat diverting feature of thÂ«
performance is the skillful and consistent side
stepping of the issue which has gone on all
along the line. Each party concerned passes
the buck along to the next one, thereby pre
venting the responsibility from locating In a
definite spot. The* result of this system la
easy to see. The negotiations are In exactly
the position that they wera four weeks ago.
when application was first made; they have
traveled in a circle.
BERKELEY, Oct. 7.â -Editor W. T.
Hale of the X>aily Californlan has is
sued a statement in criticism of the
authorities of the university for caus
ing the postpanment of the senior as
sembly, the dance held annually in
Hearst Hall.
The editorial outlines the action
taken by the students in petitioning
President Wheeler for the use of
Hearst Hall, the reference of the pe
tition to the faculty . committee upon
student affairs, the failure of that
committee to consider the matter, the
repeated application, to Acting Secre
tary Henderson, who waited until
President Wheeler's return from the
East, and the final arrival of the date
for the - assembly- . without -the neces
sary permission having been granted.
It denounces the red tape used by the
authorities and concludes:
Now this Is not exasperating. The manage
ment may think so, but it Is not. It is highly
pleasant and diverting. We are Just begin
ning to realize the significance of the "red
tape" jokes cracked from time Immemorial.
If it takes this amount of the scarlet article
to determine the disposition of one university
building on a particular night, what tons must
be required to decide a really important
matter!

The police to-night searched the resi
dence formerly occupied by Mrs. Lane
and found the models that Sprague said
his landlady had shown to him. The
plaster outfit will be turned over to the
United States Secret Service for such
disposition as the Government authori
ties decide to make of the case.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Oct. 7.
After withholding for three months
information that might have led to the
arrest of a counterfeiting gang, or at
least the confiscation of an outfit, Spe
cial Policeman George Sprague to-day
admitted to Chief of Police Hodgkins
his dereliction. Sprague was summon
ed to police headquarters this after
noon and made a statement which in
volves Mrs. George Lane, formerly re
siding at 756 Harrison street, but whose
whereabouts is unknown to the po
lice.
Sprague told the Chief of Police that
Mrs. Lane, at whose home the special
officer had resided, several months ago
showed him a number of plaster of
paris molds for the manufacture of
counterfeit coins. The casts were pre
pared J for five, ten, twenty-five and
fifty cent pieces. Sprague asserted
that the paraphernalia had been In
Mrs. Lane's possession and that 6he
had explained to him In some detail
the purposes for which the molds were
intended.
But the â¢ episode did not strongly
enough impress itself on Sprague until
a short time ago, when the special po
liceman confided In A. McDiarmid, a
private detective, residing at 677 Sixth
street. Through that source knowledge
of the circumstance was imparted to
Harry Moffitt, a United States Secret
Service agent. Investigation was made,
but it was too late. Mrs. Lane had dis
appeared.
Not until to-day did the Chief of Po
lice get information of the affair. He
sharply Queried Sprague and demanded
to know why the officer had so long
withheld his knowledge of the
matter. Sprague was asked if It
were not true that he had kept the cir
cumstances a secret until after he had
had a falling out with Mrs. Lane.
This he did not deny. He ad
mitted to Hodgkins that hope of a
reward had also induced him to talk
about the matter, when he had finally
decided to disclose the incident to Mc-
Diarmid.
Chief Hodgkins will lay the case be
fore the Police Commissioners." -
I have not noticed any of the rivalry be
tween sections of California that is supposed
to exist. On the other hand, I have noticed
that "California" Is being made the great war
cry of all of those connected with the different
displays.
There Is one thine that I shall advocate at
all times and in all placesâ that the people of
Oakland do everything in their power to get
the other San Francisco papers to follow the
example of The Call. The Call, though a
San Francisco paper, has done a wonderful
work for Alameda County. Hundreds of San
Â¦Francisco papers are being circulated In St.
Laouis, but in only one can any Oakland news
be found, and that one is The Call. When
a man becomes Interested in California he buys
a California paper. If he buys a Call he finds
out that there Is such a place as Alameda
County, that we have here the State univer
sity, that we have a great city and great
prospect.'. If he buys any other paper there
is no reference to Oakland unless it be some
sensational story that does not reflect credit
upon the community. The people who are
working for the advancement of this side of
the bay owe much to The Call and It Is "only
when they go East that they fully realize it.
California is groin* to reap a great deal of
benefit from its exhibit at the St. Louis Fair.
Other States have good exhibits, but California
i3 the only one In the Union that has both a
State building and a separate display from
each county. California has really twenty
two exhibits and there are eighty people rep
resenting this commonwealth. The result Is
that California Is being advertised as Is no
other State In the Union.
Wilbur Walker, secretary of the
Alameda County World's Fair Asso
ciation, returned from St. Louis to
day filled with ideas about the ad
vancement of California and of Ala
meda County in particular. Mr. Walk
er made a complete and exhaustive
examination into the methods of
"booming," and he has some ideas
that he will advance to the different
commercial organizations of Oakland.
He especially praises the work of The
Call for Oakland and Alameda Coun
ty. This is what Mr. Walker had to
say:
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1016 Broadway, Oct. 7-
Erik O. Lindblom, a mining million
aire of Alaska, to-day alleged in a pe
tition for a writ of review that property
in Berkeley belonging to him worth
$15,000 has been sold to a collection
agency In satisfaction of a Judgment
against him amounting to $130. Lind
blom declares that no summons in this
suit for $130 was served, nor notice of
substitution when the original plaintiff
assigned his judgment against Lind
blom to the collection agency.
Judge Quinn's court is made defend
ant in Llndblom's proceeding, as the
acts complained of were done under
the authority of Justice Quinn. In this
court on May 1, 1904, C. B. Scofleld se
cured judgment against the millionaire
for $130. Scofleld assigned his judgment
to the Wellman-Robbina Mercantile
Agency. To the agency's attorney, J.
A. Taylor, was then sold Llndblom's
realty in Berkeley, at Warring street
and Dwight way, the alleged value of
the realty being $15,000, to satisfy the
Judgment.
Lindblom has "since been Informed of
the proceeding and desires that it be
reviewed and corrected In the particu
lars which he says are defective. - '-

Water Front Notes.
YeMeriay he started to unmoor ship and
h'ist the starboard anchor. As the cabK"
came slowly in, link by link, thÂ» jailors .it
the windlass wore rich, blue, deep-sea oath*
that thÂ»-y never pulled at an anchor of such
remarkable tonnage. As the chain came out of
the water it was seen that the port anchor wan
hrwik*-Â«1 into the starboard oable. The men (=aid
fomi" more picturesque ultra marine blue things
Â¦ nd bent their backs to the double burden. When
that anchor had reached its mate's haws?
pipe the other one was still on the bottom
of thr bay and no more anchor could be
lio;st*-d undr-r thopÂ» conditions aboard that
Fhip. Po the two crews are trylr.Â«? to cut the

The British ship Alice A. Leigii. which has
been mo lon^ ldla for want of a. charter, is try
ing to get away for Newcastle. Australia,
Â¦wher* there is a cargo of coÂ«d awaiting- her
comin*. The skipper expresses strong senti
ments to thÂ« mate, who coats them a little
thicker with sulphur and sends them along
the deck to the bo's'n. Thla salty mariner
touches a match to the message, as it were,
with a few choice words of his own, and kicks
the first able seaman within reach.
ThU is i.:i because the Alice can't pet
away fnr Newcastle for thoee "coals." She
can't (jet her anchors up. 'Tls remarkable,
but that brace of heavy mud hooks are still

NEW YORK, Oct. 7.â Owing to inter
ruption in the telegraph lines messages
from the island of Martinique have
been badly delayed. Between Cape
Haytien and Puerto Plata, in the isl
and of San Domingo, it is necessary to
send them by courier, involving twelve
hours' delay. Â«
It is believed here that Mont Pelee
is once more in eruption, as the entire
country on the Windward Islands is
covered with ashes.
FORT DK FRANCE. Island of Mar
tinique, Thursday, Oct. 6 (delayed in
transmission).â The report that there
has been a serious eruption of Mont
Pelee is not true. There has been great
activity on the mountain during the
last few days, and a week ago the vol
cano emitted enormous quantities of
steam and ashes. On September 29 the
mountain threw out steam all day,
forming a dense cloud SOOO or 10,000 feet
high. The activity grew less violent as
night approached, but after dark there
were two points on the cone that were
brilliantly lighted, while at the foot of
the dome was a hole from which fire
escaped into the valley below, but not
in sufficient quantities to occasion dam
age.
When arrested the man wore kid
gloves, patent leather shoes, a light
overcoat of expensive make and car
ried a silver-headed cane. When
seized he protested with indignation
against the arrest. The police were
puzzled for a few moments, but the
Insistence of the women pursuers con
vinced them, and Russell was taken to
the police station, where later he is
said to have admitted the robbery-
Burglars' tools and false keys were
fcund in the man's pockets. Several
pieces of Jewelry, supposed to have
been thrown away by the man during
the chase, were found in the street.
Russell is accused by the police of
nearly twenty robberies committed in
the Garfield Park district in the last
month.
CHICAGO, Oct. 7. â Pursued by two
women and a score of pupils of the
Marshall High School, Harry Russell,
whom the police call "the gentleman
burglar" and who has been sought for
weeks, has been captured after a
cliase covering several blocks. The
pursuit was along the streets of the
residence district about Garfield Park
and followed an attempt at burglary.

MAKES A CONFESSION
It is believed that Captain Kirkwood,
as he knew his ship and cargo were a
lawful prize for any Japanese cruiser
that might be in that locality, was
keeping close in shore to dodge possible
pursuers and thus got into dangerous
waters. This was the first large vessel
to carry a cargo from this port to Si
beria, and the result is discouraging.
The following are her officers: Cap
tain. Alexander Kirkwood; first officer,
J. B. Rohan; second officer, A. D. Cole;
third officer, A. McAlman; chief en
gineer, J. M. Spencer; first assistant,
C. Kineman; second assistant, E.
Swanson; third assistant, J. Elvin;
carpenter, Gus Lill. The crew numbers
fifty-eight all told.
Mrs. Kirkwood, who went to British
Columbia after the Mineola sailed for
Asia, returned a few days ago and has
since been watching the Golden Gate
from her residence in the Western Ad
dition to see her husband's ship steam
into the harbor, as the vessel is due.
The first news she received was of the
wreck, with the saving of all hands.
The vessel was built in England in
188S and came to this coast in 1893. She
was 275 feet long, 28 feet beam and 19
feet in depth. She had been provided
recently with new boilers and exten
sive repairs had made her almost a
new vessel. She was valued at about
$200,000 and was insured. Her speed
was twelve knots.
The Mineola was owned by the Pa
cific Improvement Company, George
Crocker president, of this city, and was
chartered by Roth, Blum & Co. to car
ry general merchandise to Siberia and
return with furs. She sailed from this
port June 27, and was on her way home
when the accident happened. Roth,
Blum & Co., upon whom the loss of the
cargo will fall, say they have no idea
how much freight was in the vessel.
She had on board an JSO.OOO cargo when
she sailed from San Francisco, and she
had two more Siberian ports to visit
before starting homeward.
The steamer was commanded by Cap
tain Alexander Kirkwood, a master
mariner well known in the Pacific. He
is skillful and experienced, and not the
slightest doubt is expressed among
shipping men that the accident was un
avoidable. The officers of the Pacific
Improvement Company said last even
ing that the firm has the utmost con
fidence in Captain Kirkwood's seaman
ship.
The boats headed for Kamschatka
and were shortly afterward picked up
by the British sloop-of-war Algerine,
which was fortunately cruising in those
waters and which landed all the sur
vivors at Hakodate.
The big steel steamer Mineola, which
came to the coast eleven years ago and
has passed in and out of this port many
limes, lies fathoms deep under the Pa
cific off the shore of Kamschatka. It
was an uncharted rock, that viewless
and unknown peril of the sea which
some stanch ship often finds and marks
the place of discovery with her own re
mains, that sent the Mineola to de
struction. A cablegram from Hako
date yesterday announces that the
steamer, while returning to San Fran
cisco from Northern Siberian ports,
struck a rock near Tigel Bar Septem
ber 5 and sank. The strong engines
drove the vessel with great force on the
rock, and she began to till immediate
ly. Captain Kirkwood ordered all hands
into the boats, and soon after they left
the steamer she rolled over, slid off the
rock and disappeared forever.

Shawls and fabrics so delicate that
they could be "drawn through a lady's
ring" is a type of luxury familiar in
old tales of Oriental magnificence, and
many of the new silks displayed on
the counters this fall are so thin and
supple that a width of the fabrics
might easily be threaded through as
small a circlet without leaving a
crease, says the New York Sun. Chif
fon weaves have invaded all the fa
miliar silks, faille and grosgrain , be
ing the last to fall into line. Rumors
that silks would take on more body
and rustle this fall have all been si
lenced by the appearance of the new
materials, which, as a whole, are softer
if anything than ever. Authorities as
sert that . the silks being woven, for
next spring's trade go even further' In
this direction. Chiffon faille, an old
friend with a new characteristic," : is
one of the most popular weaves with
both dressmaker and milliner. / It
comes in all the modish tones at $1 a
yard. All the season's silks have more
luster than for many seasons.

THE editor of a Southern California weekly journal asks: "Why
should any one like San Francisco?" Then he presents a col
umn of reasons, social, political and climatic, why nobody
should like San Francisco as a permanent dwelling place. He thought
he knew whereof he reasoned, for, as he says, he spent two consecu
tive unhappy weeks in San Francisco.
But his query is not devoid of interest to the several hundreds
of thousands of folk who like San Francisco well enough to make it
their home. Their reasons for preferring life here above life any
where else would probably be just as convincing as those adduced by
the Southern California framer of public thought. People like to live
in San Francisco because their residence enables them to find more
to gratify their personal comfort than they can find by residing else
where. They get more of the things they desire than they can in
any other city, town or hamlet in this or any other country.
The visitor from other Pacific Coast communities can never
quite understand the San Francisco attitude toward either San
Francisco or toward the other Pacific Coast communities. As a
matter of fact, the San Francisco resident seldom thinks at all
about other communities, and certainly is never jealous of them. He
is as indifferent to them as he is careless of their opinion of San
Francisco. The Seattleite or Portlander or Los Angelan can ex
press any opinion he chooses of San Francisco, and the average San
Francisco man will not wrangle with him about it. All that he
insists upon is that he prefers to live here.
The visitor who spends only two weeks in San Francisco cannot
comprehend the spirit of San Francisco life or understand the San
Francisco point of view. He is certain to fail if he has been a prom
inent figure in a smaller community, for he is so quickly absorbed
in the mass that he can never quite forgive the city for its utter in
difference to him. Which may be explanatory of the query pro
pounded by the journalist from south of the Tehachapi who spent
an uncomfortable fortnight here.
Professor Thomas Oliver, address
ing the Industrial hygiene section of
the sanitary congress in Glasgow, said
the system of "rushing" work Intro
duced Into Britain from America not
only caused unwholesome fatigue and
many accidents, but "predisposed the
individual to ill health and created a
taste for stimulants, unhealthy recre
ation and love of excitement such as
was offered by theaters and music
halls."

Here is a tasty dish that utilizes an
inexpensive cut of meat: Select a neck
of lamb, separate it into the natural
sections and cut the meat from the
bones. Have a casserole at hand, put
Into It two tablespoonfuls of butter and
saute in it a small onion. As soon as
the onion is a golden brown put In the
lamb, which has been rolled In salted
and peppered flour. Saute it until it is
nicely browned on all sides. Then add
two large slices of tomato, a table
spoonful or two of minced ham and two
cupfuls of seasoned meat stock or hot
water flavored with beef extract and a
little kitchen bouquet. Cover the dish
tight, put it in the oven and cook slow
ly for two hours. If vegetable flavoring
is liked, about twenty minutes before
the dish Is to be served diced carrot
and turnip and green peas may be con
tributed. Send to the table in the cas
serole.
The day of mitts is returning and
their popularity is due to the Marie
Antoinette sleeve. This Is a sleeve
which is tight to the elbow, where it
is met by a wide ruffle of lace which
falls oft! the arm. This sleeve is used
for dinner gowns and for evening
dresses. It has been worn more or
less all summer and will be the fash
ionable sleeve of the coming winter.
It is particularly handsome as an opera
sleeve, being neither too short for good
taste nor too long for elegance.
The mitt, be it black or white, is
leng, is made of silk, of course, and is
embroidered upon the back. The dainty
knitted silk mitt is affected by women
who can afford to hire the knitting
done by hand. It is open work, is done
in flesh color and is a mass of intri
cate stitches. The seed designs are
most popular and the openwork drop
stitches, so well known to the knitters
of bygone days, will be seen. At a din
ner given recently a guest wore mitts
of flesh-colored silk with a small con
ventional raised vine upon the back,
all in pink and green. Her fingers were
loaded with handsome rings and brace
lets adorned her arms. Another guest
present wore black silk mitts embroid
ered upon the back with pink roses.
These roses were raised and were re
markably pretty, matching the gown,
which was a shell pink voile, perfectly.

Editor The Call-in spite of the noble
work of the San Francisco Call the im
provement bonds have again been de
feated. Who is at fault, the people or
city official fakers?
Why were not the Improvement
bonds subjected to the people as the
interest of the city at large?
Over 7000 votes were cast. Over 4000
selfish people, unreasonably In the ex
treme, voted "yes" on somehlng to
benefit themselves and "no" on what
would benefit friends, relatives and
their children. Yet they all were sup
posed to wprk for the future Oakland.
For seventeen years I have known Oak
land and during: all of that period I
have observed the selfishness of the
people.
May God help us to stick together In
the future and think as one man of
the interests of our city and Its future
inhabitants. OLAF J. HANSSEN.

In special articles and facts, fads and fancies for women there
is a wide scope of entertaining reading matter. Augusta Frescott
writes of the return of the high shoulder puff for women, describes
the coming silk gown, gives some tips for prudent dressers, and a
half column of advice on how women can make their own trim
mings. Madge Moore writes on "Masculine Taste in Manners" and
answers correspondents: and Professor Miehling contributes the
last of his talks on "Physical Culture at Home."
There is a full page with splendid half tones on "The Newspaper
Artists' Exhibit," which is to be held in the Maple Room of the
Palace Hotel shortly; a page on the Greek drama, "Ajax," to be
presented at Berkeley; and the book page, by Robert W. Ritchie. In
addition there are shorter items of interest and storiettes sprinkled
throughout the sixteen pages, and of course, the puzzle page for the
children.
<<""pHE GRAFTERS/' by Francis Lynde, will begin in the Sun-
I day Call Magazine to-morrow. "The Grafters" is, as its
name might suggest, a political story. It is told tersely, di
rectly and forcibly; and throughout the author has shown a keen
insight into the motives that actuate men for good or evil in public
life, and a thorough knowledge of the subtle gradations^ by which
men of too little stamina succumb to the lowering of their princi
ples of equity and right until they are in purely for the "graft." As
befits a popular novel, there is a thoroughly enjoyable contest at
hearts between the young lawyer who throws himself heart and soul
into the struggle with the junta, and the girl who is his inspiration,
and who fears he in turn will become one with the grafters. In
view of the coining campaign the story is particularly timely.
In shorter fiction and essay matter the edition is, as usual,
graced with such celebrated names as Marie Corelli and Jerome K.
Jerome, the former having "The Madness of Clotfies" and the !atter
"On Being Introduced," both keen satires on social topics ; the reg
ular installment of the "Batch of Love Letters" series is contrib
uted by W. Pett Ridge, and Frank T. Bullen contributes a humorous
tale, ".Vat's Monlcev/?
THE SUNDAY CALL MAGAZINE.
TOM WATSON, the Presidential nominee of the People's party,
would do many surprising things if Judge Parker would only
get out of his way and allow him to control "the great militant
Democratic party from sea to sea.'' He is modest enough to admit
that even under these highly improbable circumstances he might not
actually whip the Republicans, but he would promise his opponents
a battle royal worthy of so great an occasion. The Populist candi
date "longs for and loves the thunder of the guns" nearly as much
as he seems to love the sound of his own voice, but inasmuch as
Judge Parker shows no inclination to abdicate in favor of his some
what noisy rival we may assume that the Democratic party has as
little use for Mr. Watson as has the country at large.
When Tom Watson detailed some of the labor misfortunes from
which the country has momentarily suffered he was simply utilizing
the well-worn stock in trade of the Democratic party, which seeks
its opportunity and its advertisement in human misery and social
lawlessness and strives to reap a political harvest in the fields of dis
content. The Democratic party knows well that national prosperity
means Republican success, and their dismay at the overwhelming
proofs of the country's progress is sufficiently evidenced by the zeal
with which they parade and exaggerate every transient factor which
can be twisted and distorted into an opposite indication.
The state of the country is, however, a matter of invincible sta
tistics and bank balances. For the month of September Government
receipts were nearly $4,000,000 in excess of expenditure, and this
points to a big surplus at the end of the fiscal year. The Democrats
had of course hoped for a deficit, which woultf have made them feel
once more at home. The expanding receipts, moreover, come from
internal revenue, and this again means increased purchasing power,
one of the surest indices of national wellbeing. The savings bank
returns are of an even more convincing nature. In 1896 the deposits
amounted to $1,907,156,277, while in 1903 they had risen to $2,935,
204.845. Such evidences as these could be multiplied almost ad
nauseam. President Roosevelt was not using mere terms of speech
nor figures of rhetoric when he said at Minneapolis: "We are now
in a condition of prosperity unparalleled not merely in our own his
tory, but in the history of any other nation. This prosperity is deep
rooted and stands on a firm basis because it is due to the fact that
the average American has in him the stuff out of which victors are
made in the great industrial contests of the present day, just as in
the great military contests of the past, and because he is now able to
use and develop his qualities to best advantage under our well
established economic system."
THE POPULIST CANDIDATE.
For this reason, probably, platonic
love does not thrive in our American
civilization, which has a cold-blooded
way of looking facts in the face and
calling: them by their right names. W*>
1 have friendships and flirtations; we
i have true love, strong and deep be
| tween betrothed and married lovers;
we have unrequited love, a painful
malady, a thorn in the flesh of the
lover; we have follies and infidelity of
thought and action, and we have di
vorce courts in plenty.
But platonic love, that ethereallzed
human passion, does not exist among
us. Such a colorless incense of one
soul before another belongs to a ro
mantic, a sentimental people. In our
practical world of every-day life there
is nothing in the notion â except the
heartache.
I have only Spartan advice to give
when a young matron writes to me
that a young; man, not her husband,
loves her, and she, a loyal wife and
fond mother, does not know what to
do. Should she try to influence him
through his love lcÂ±. her, and inspire
him to all that Is not>le and good; or
should she hesitate in such a course,
lest, if she allows his love to grow, it
vill make him unhappy In the end?
When suffering must sooner or later
be inflicted, a quick, sure pain is the
kindest to give, and the easiest to
bear.
A woman who is married to a good
man, and Is mother of his children,
must not play with fire. She cannot get
hurt herself without her family's
sharing in the disaster. And ten to
one some floating bit of her mental
drapery will catch the blaze and ignite
her mind and soul.
Then there is the other side of it,
the man's side. If a woman cannot
marry a man who loves her, for one
reason or another, there is one way,
and one only, that she can be his in
spiration â by letting him keep his
ideal of her as pure and high as it was
in its inception. Disappointment In
love never yet ruined a really strong
man, provided he was able to keep his
ideals unshattered; and no lasting
good will come from buoying up a
weak man, unless you can undertake
a life contract.
When a woman takes the trouble to
assure herself and others of her loy
alty to her husband and her children,
the time is a more critical one for her
than she imagines.
There is only one sensible course
when a married woman suspects that
a man friend has fallen in love with
her. She must end the relationship
as quickly and as tactfully as possible,
for his sake as well as for her own.
But when put In the balance
with common sense it is lighter than
wind-blown mist, writes Dorothy Feni
more in the Chicago Journal.
PLATONIC love is platonlc fool
ishness. It looks nice on pa
per. It sounds well in high
sounding, stilted sentences.

Ellen Waterman from Frederick J.
"Waterman, who was accused of com
mitting ' Innumerable acts of cruelty
during the entire sixteen years of their
married life.
A triple charge of neglect, cruelty
and inftdelity was lodged yesterday by
Elsie M. Cleary against George M.
Cleary, some time detective and mem
tloned In connection with the recent
Grace McXaughton case.
The McXaughton woman is named as
co-respondent by Mrs. Cleary, who al
leges that Cleary lived openly with her
at the Larkspur Villa, In Marin County,
from July 13 to 30 last. Grace Me-
Naughton was accused of burglary In
Oakland and was brought back from
Los Angeles to answer, but the charge
was not sustained and she was dis
charged. She then secured a warrant
for the arrest of Cleary for stealing a
diamond ring from her.
Mrs. Cleary's complaint says that she
married Cleary December 1, 1901, and
that he has neglected to provide for
her for more -than a year. In Novem
ber of last year she went to his room
to persuade him to return to her and
found another woman there. He threat
ened to call the porter to throw his
wife out, she says. In July last he came
to her room at 2930 Fulton street with
a diamond ring. He told her, she says,
that he had "been put on a case of a
stolen ring and had found it in the pos
session of a small boy, but had not had
time to take it to the Police Depart
ment." She told him jokingly that she
did not believe the story, and taking
the ring started to put it on. There
upon, she says, he choked her until her
neck was black and blue. On another
occasion when he had absented him
self she found that he was at the Cal
laghan building. She went there to see
him, but he told her he did not care
for her and would never live with her
again. Charles H. Hinckey is the plain
tiff's attorney.

Again, If their evidence contained some

their evidence should have been, how would
he explain the palpable error which he made
In the first page of his comments upon the
case by making the applicant, I-lm Fong, his
own uncle and a resident of Oakland for some
years last passed" We sincerely congratulate
the department of Injustice of this great land,
which has established a cowardly rule to ex
clude . helpless native Chinese citizens of the
United Slates when the country and the of
ficials do not dare to exclude the natives of
fighting and victorious Japan, who are be
coming a far greater menace to the laborers
of America than the Chinese were ever al
leged to have been.
As to the uncle's testimony, it must be clear
to any unprejudiced mind that It bears the
stamp of truth and veracity. He honestly
states he did not stand directly over the mother
of Lim Fong at the identical moment of his
birth, which birth has been absolutely proved
btyond the peradventure of a doubt to have
occurred in Chinatown In the city of Oakland
and the State of California, U. S. A., 26 years
a~o.
In view of the monumental error of the ex
amining Inspector in erectin* such a bugaboo
by laying- auch stress upon the inadmisslbllUy
or hearsay evidence, which we regret to see.

low citizen and distinguished legal light. Com
missioner North, who eo unjustly commented
upon the evidence of the unfortunate Chinese
who, without the protection of counsel, show
by their evidence the fear and trembling which
they felt.
M. M. Foote, an attorney, filed a
unique document yesterday in the
United States District Court as part of
a petition in habeas corpus on behalf
of Lim Fong. a Chinese laborer, who
arrived by the Siberia on May 27 and
wag denied a landing. Lim Fong claim
ed to be a native American and ap
pealed to the Secretary of the Depart
ment of Commerce and Labor. The of
ficial confirmed the action of United
States Immigrant Commissioner Hart
North. The appeal is appended to the
petition for the writ of habeas corpus
and is decidedly unconventional. The

For some time the San Francisco
Lacrosse Club has been endeavoring
to arrange a match between the play
ers of this* city and of Los Angeles,
but it Is not likely the match will come
off. The Los Angeles placers demand
ed a guarantee of their traveling and
hotel expenses and a share of the gate
receipts. The San Francisco club is
unable to accede to these terms. The
lacrosse championship of the State is
thus left in doubt. The San Francisco
team won a clear victory over the San
Mateo twelve, and the San Mateo team
beat the Los Angeles players in their
own city. A series of matches between
the San Francisco and Los Angeles
teams would have been Interesting,
and it is to be regretted it could not
be arranged.

The coursing parks are experiencing
considerable 'difficulty in securing
hares. Owing to the early season there
is an abundance of green feed in the
San Joaquin and the hares have taken
to- tho foothills. With a severe winter
these conditions will prevail for some
time.
The latest advices from the East
are to the effect that the American
Waterloo will be run at the meeting
which opens at Friend, Neb., on the
ISth instant. This will continue four
weeks. The Mississippi Valley Futur
ity will be the big event of the meet
ing. The Burke Cup stake and the
American Derby, for puppies, will also
be run. Only $300 will be added to
the Waterloo Cup, so it will be more
for the honor than for the value that
owners will send their hounds.
It is expected Ed Neeves, who spent
some time on this coast, will act as
judge.
James Sweeney will attend the meet

Though tho cricket championship of
1904 was won last Sunday by the San
Francisco County Club, one or two
more matches will be played before the
season is brought to a close. To
morrow, on the ground at Webster
street, Alameda, there will be a rally
of veteran cricketers. Henry Ward of
the Alameda Club and Taliesin Evans
of the San Francisco County Club will ;
select teams on the field.
The veterans from whom the sides
will be picked are J. Addison, A. E.

Ward and George Wiseman.
The members of both teams playing
for the championship last Sunday must
have been nervous, for the first nine
men of tho Alameda eleven scored only
27 runs in all, anil, though Harold Ward
added 2S runs off his own bat, he should
have beon given out by the umpire for
Obstructing a fielder. When tho score
had reached 45 runs the Alameda cap
tain bumped into K. J. Stratton, who
was in the act of catching the ball.
Of tho San Francisco team nine
scored only a dozen runs, the whole
score being mado by Captain Richard
son (C5) and E. J. Stratton (29). Henry
Roberts bowled well for San Francisco,
capturing seven Alameda wickets for 33
runs. Roberts has bowled conslstently
wcll throughout the'season, and, though
Davies has a rather better average,
Roberts has captured far more wickets.

The fine of $25 Imposed upon Poly
technic will undoubtedly have a ten
dency to make the teams live up to
the rules and be less Independent.
Stringent measures are needed and
that they will be resorted to was
proved at the committee meeting.
Lick and Polytechnic are undoubt
edly the best high school teams In the
city and that they are evenly matched
was demonstrated when they met two
weeks ago. Neither side scored and
neither had a perceptible advantage.
The game must be played off not lat
er than the 15 th Inst. It Is needless
to say that coaches and players will
do their utmost next week to put ths
strongest team possible In the field.
When these two teams coma together
probably the best academic game ever
played in the city will result. Neither
team has lost a game. Polytechnic
was scored against by Mission, but
won easily.
Lowell has lost twice and Mission
and "Wilmerdlng have withdrawn, so
that the game between Lick and Poly
technic will decide the local suprem
acy. Mission, although beaten only
once and then not badly beaten,
either, got enough and would not play
Lick during the week. The default
ing team should have been fined for
not sending word beforehand of the
Intention not to play.
Sensational Game expected When
These High School Elevens Meet.
The football atmosphere of the
Academic Athletic League has been
cleared and from now on there will
be less squabbling and more playing.
Lick's protest against Polytechnic was
not sustained and these two teams
will have to play off their tie game.
Lick will appeal, but in the meantime
the game will be played and the ques
tion of supremacy between them set
tled. The same thing happened last
year. Polytechnic protested Lick and
In the meantime played and lost to
the latter school. Subsequently tha
protest was sustained and Polytechnic,
although beaten decisively by Lick,
was declared champlan of the sub
league.
Polytechnic played Berkeley High
in the finals and was beaten. Tha
score was close and many figured that
Lick would have beaten Berkeley.
One thing was proved last year, and
that was that the best team did not
win. The rivalry between the city
teams is even more keen than that
between the teams from different
sides of the bay.
IJCK TO PLAY POLYTECHNIC.
The rumors that some men were
breaking training have subsided, and
with the close watch that is being kept
by the coaches little further trouble of
that variety may be expected. The in
juries suffered by the men thus far
have been slight, which goes to show
that their condition on the whole is
good. After to-morrow comparisons can
be made with the team that supports
the cardinal, and coaches and prognos
ticators will find their way a trifle
lighter. ; .?
Competition for nearly every place Is
keen, and that Is bound to raise the
standard of the team. Practice has
been going on regularly all the week.
Every aspirant with any kind of abil
ity is getting a show, and the line-up
for the supreme struggle will consist
of the eleven best men.
The men are getting plenty of falling
on the ball, catching punts, stopping
line and end plays and breaking inter
ference. Every day there are large
crowds of spectators, and none of the
men are allowed to forget that they are
working for California. During the
week the men who are most likely can
didates have been sent to quarters and
the training table, where they will get
all the care a good athlete needs.
BERKELEY, Oct. 7.â The football
players and enthusiasts of the Univer
sity of California are looking forward
with a great deal of interest to to-mor
row's game between the varsity and the
Olympic team. The eleven from the
club across the bay felt sure of winning
the contest scheduled to take place Sep
tember 24, and would surely have put
up a warm fight if the game had not
been called off. California will be much
stronger to-morrow than she was two
weeks ago, and if the visitors win they
will earn their victory well. The ground
will be wet on account of the rain, and
a considerable amount of fumbling may
be expected.
Last Saturday's game with the Sher
man Indians has raised the spirits of
every one who hopes that the blue and
gold will carry off the championship
this year. The varsity played admira
bly, and if the squad can continue im
proving as fast for the next five weeks
as It has for the last three Stanford
will have a run for its money. In spite
of the fact that several of the best men
of last year are not playing this season,
there are some new boys who are likely
to perform wonders before the last
game is over.
Sperry stands a chance of becoming
a splendid back. He has the strength,
bulk and speed which go to make up a
crackajack. Mead is another man who
will help make the scores look big.
Stern and Force are doing finely In the
line, and from present indications they
wlll not be so easy for Stanford as some
of the center men were last year. Oliver
is good for one end and Howard for the
other, although Caminetti or Henry
may crowd one of them out. Heltmul
ler is, of course, a tower of strength.
Gray is doing well at guard, and White
and Lassater have good chances to
start in the big game if they keep at
work.
The work of the freshmen through
out the season has been disappointing.
Coming out with the largest squarl that
has ever represented an entering class,
great things were expected, but little
has been materialized. The line, sup
posed to be the strongest, has shown
itself pitiably weak. The Belmont
halves sifted through it in the last
game at will. The backs were also
furnishing a poor exhibition of foot
ball, and, barring: one or two brilliont
individual plays, their work was a dis
appointment to the coaches.
With one more week's steady prac
tice. Coach Hauverman may be able
to put on the touches that are needed,
and on the final day send a strong
team on the field. Coach Lahagan did
the same thing last year and took
California by surprise. Freshman
games are all a gamble, the team that
gets the first jump generally winning
out, even though it be tho weaker. The
addition of Horton and Tomasini, the
two big tackles who have been play
ing on the varsity squad all season,
to the freshman line will add greatly
to the young team's strength, and will
give the men a new feeling of ag
gressiveness. The b.ocks will so
through strenuous signal practice all
week, and they should round into shape
in time for the game.
The varsity has been unfortunate this
week In the number of men injured,
and many substitutes have been play-
Ing on the big team. Weller, Chalmers
and Brennan, the three backs, have all
been laid up at different times. West
and Hyde have water on the knee,
and the other players are sore from
the hard training. The Olympic game
was a bad one, and the men have not
all recovered from the effects of it. Be
cause of this Coach Lanagan has spent
the week at signal practice and in de
veloping fast team play. He has only
permitted one scrimmage game.
The absence of Hyde at center has
necessitated a change in the line-up of
the first eleven. Shields, last year's,
tackle and one of the shiftiest men on
the team, has been moved from the
right tackle's position, and wiil pass
the ball from center. Tomasini, the
freshman player, is filling Shields'
place. This change should benefit tho
team, as it adds a strong player to the
center, the place which has been the
weakest.
"Savage" Dole will return to the
game. The followers, of college football
received the news from Coach Lanagan
yesterday. Dole is one of the best
half-backs the Stanford squad has
ever. had. He is not a spectacular
player, but he is wonderfully consist
ent, equally good on blocking 'Â¦Â¦Â¦ up a
play or running with the ball. He is
a first-class punter, and his presence
In the line-up will add strength to
the team.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Oct. 7.â
With the intercollegiate freshman
game with the University of California
only one week off, all the attention of
the cardinal supporters has been cen
tered on the'work of the Stanford baby
team. The fast work against Oakland
two weeks ago encouraged the coaches
and started a feelins of confidence
among the members of the young squad.
The tie contest with Belmont school,
when the "prep" boys both outplayed
and outgeneraled tne collegians,
showed' that any feeling of confidence
was sadly misplaced, and that the out
look for an intercollegiate victory was
far from bright.

In the upper section of the top half
Baker is expected to win out. Mac-
Gavin is conceded the- other place in
this half. In the upper part of the bot
tom half there are three men who have
about an equal chance. They are Whit
ney, Murdock and Smith. The latter
Seets the winner of the Whitney-Mur
Â»ck match and the winner goes Into
the semi-finals.
A new tournament committee has
been appointed at the California Club,
and in future there will be more tour
naments. The committee is composed
of Drummond MacGavin, C. J. Smith
and Dr. Lovegrove. They will meet
early next week and will arrange a
schedule for the winter months. Aside
from the handicap doubles tourna
ments for the Directors' cups, there will
be class, handicap and scratch events.
Many of the old-time players of the
club have again become members and
will figure in the tournaments.
In the lower section of the lower half
the best man seems to be Noble. He is
not a first-class player, but is expected
to win from Hotchkiss.
The best match of the day will be
that between Whitney and Murdock.
Whitney is playing in his old-time form
and Murdock will find him harder to
beat than when they met at San Ra
fael.
The Baker-Griffin match will be an
other interesting one. Griffin disposed
of Baker's younger brother last Sun
day quite handily. Baker was also in
fine fettle, as his match with Allen
proved. If Baker can play as well as
he did last Sunday Griffin can hardly
beat him.
Play in the first annual. tennis tour
nament for the championship of the
bay counties will be resumed to-mor
row on the r>ark courts. Owing to the
numerous defaults and. the fact that
the committee had about six courts at
its disposal the first and nearly all of
the second round was completed. When
play is over for the day to-morrow It
is expected there will be but eight of
the sixty-four players left in the com
petition.
From now on the best players will
come together and the matches will be
better than they were last Sunday. In
the third round Percy Murdock and
R. N. Whitney will meet, as will George
Baker and Clarence Griffin. In this
round Drummond MacGavin will play
George Janes. Despite the fact that
the latter beat Will Collier last Sunday
he Is not conceded a chance against
the coast champion. Grant Smith and
Herbert Long, the clever young player
from the California Club, will probably
meet in the third round. Long has two
sets love on Hotchklss and is expected
to win his match. Long always makes
a good showing against Smith in prac
tice.

TO BE RESUMED
Closing days are approaching: rapid
ly. The San Francisco Club will take
its closing cruise on Sunday, the 23d
inst., while the Corinthian and Cali
fornia clubs have their last cruises of
the season set for Sunday, the 30th.
Last Saturday night several yachts
of the Corinthian fleet cruised over to
Sausallto and dropped anchor there,
among them being Commodore T. Jen
nings' sloop Speedwell, the sloops NIx
le, Genesta, Aeolus. Edna, Emma and
Phoenicia. The yawl Emerald anchored
off Angel Island. During the evening
the yachtsmen went up to the bis hall
of the clubhouse, where Commodore
Jennings and Clarence "Ward sans so
los, Vice Commodore J. C. Brickell, F.
E. Schober, J. Briggs and "Bunty"
Short performing various stunts. On
Sunday the fleet, augmented by the
schooner Lady Ada, the yawl Frolic and
the sloops Neptune and Mischief,
cruised in the channel- The following
San Francisco yachts were under way
last Sunday: The flagship Challenger,
the sloops Minnetonka, Sappho, Ariel,
Curlew, Annie, Surprise and Thetis, the
schooners Chispa and Challenge, and
the yawls Royal and "Wave. The wind
was light off Sausallto, the yachts not
being able to get under way until 2:30
o'clock p. m. Off the San Francisco
water front^ there was a moderate
breeze.
As the power boat regatta set down
for to-morrow, on the programme of
the San Francisco Yacht Club will not
take place, to-day and Sunday are
open dates for the members. On Sat
urday, the 15th inst.. tTie fleet of tha
California Yacht Club will cruise over
to Sausallto and drop anchor there for
the night. On Sunday, the 16th Inst..
the combined fleets or the San Fran
cisco and California clubs will cruise
outside the heads.
The Corinthian fleet will cruise to
Paradise Cove to-nlgnt. where the
chowder will be served on shore. To
morrow a regatta for small sailboats
will be held over a course off Paradise
Cove.
Work on the new trotting track and
fair grounds at Santa Cruz began this
week. The track will be a regulation
mile and an effort is being made to
have the State fair held there in 1905.
There is no doubt but what popular
sentiment is against the use of hopples
and a close observer can plainly see
that this sentiment is steadily grow
ing. The only thing, seemingly, that
stands in the way at the present time
is how to accomplish the change with
the least injury to the owner of the
present hoppled horse. Several plans
have been suggested. Among the latest
and. it would seem, best, to the notion
of many, is one emanating from Secre
tary Knight of the American Trotting
Association, for it appears to be prac
tical in every way. His plan is to in
corporate in the rules a mandatory
provision that no horse can start in a
race In hopples excepting those that
have acquired a record while Â¦wearing
the "Indiana pajamas." They would
have the effect of immediately putting
a stop to the training of horses with
the pajamas while green and at the
fame time allow those who now wear
them to still use them. This would
also bring: the change and complete the
abolishment of their use without harm
to any person. As one writer says, re
garding this plan: "There would, of
course, arise a question of the handicap
that the unsteady, unhoppled ones
would have against the old hoppled
campaigners, yet this would not be any
greater. In fact would be much less,
than the other plan of setting some
certain date, say, two years hence,
when hopples would be barred alto
gether, which would practically end the
racing career of many of the horses
that now race with their legs tied. Al
together, Knight's plan Is worthy of
consideration and discussion with a
view to having a proper adjustment of
the question when the turf congresses
meet this falL"
It looks as if the 57000 Pacific Breed
ers' Futurity for foals of mares bred
this year will break all previous rec
ords Tor this stake, of which this will
be the fifth renewal. It does not close
for nomination of mares unjil next Sat
urday, October 15, but Secretary Kel
ley of the Breeders' Association has al
rrady received more than eighty en
tries. Last year one week before the
date of closing of stake No. 4 about half
this number had been received, yet the
stake received 403 entries. It is ex
pected the number will reach 500 this
year.
Monroe Salisbury has sent word to
the Pleasanton track management that
he will need forty stalls during the
tiaining season this winter, which
means his string will be larger than
that of last year. The "king maker"
will reach Pleasanton within a week
or two after the Memphis meeting
closes. The horses under his charge,
the majority of which are owned by
James Butler of New York, have won
close to $1*0,000 on the Grand Circuit
this year, and his is the largest money
winning stable.
One of the greatest trotters on the
Grand Circuit in years is the handsome
big gelding Aristo (2:08^), which won
the Occident and Stanford stakes at
Sacramento In 1902. One of his front
legs was severely injured early in the
season, and in all his races it looked
about twice its normal size. He started
in seven races, of which he won two,
was second four times and unplaced
once. As he met Sweet Marie (2:05),
Tivcrton (2:04^) and all the best ones
out this year his showing was remark
able. Ed Geers says he is the grandest
trotter he ever saw. Aristo's winnings
amount to 57175 to date. He was sired
by Nushagak, a son of Sable Wilkes,
and was bred by Alexander Brown of
Walnut Grove, Sacramento County,
who sold him to James Butler of New
York last May for 510,000.
The Woodland racetrack, where the
Yolo County district fair has been so
successfully conducted in recent years,
has been gold to Alexander Brown, pro
prietor of the Walnut Grove stock
farn, one of the few extensive trotting
horse breeding farms remaining in the
State. The sale of the property will not
make any change in the holding of the
annual fair there. Mr. Brown will re
move his stallions Xushagak and Prince
Ansel, together with his fine collection
of brood mares, to his new purchase.
Walnut Grove farm was partially un
der water last winter during the over
flow of the Sacramento River, and it
was to secure a place that is high and
dry that he purchased the Woodland
track.
California is to lose another of Its
great stallions. Two years ago an In
diana man raid $23,000 for McKinney
and took him across the mountains, and
now Sidney Dillon, sire of Lou Dillon
tliSS'i). the world's champion trotter,
is to be sold. He has been consigned by
the estate of Henry Pierce to the Old
Glory sale in New York in November,
and will be the star attraction of that
great annual event. Speculations as to
the price he will bring will be numer
ci-s now that this announcement is
made. La?t year the great trotting
stallion Bingen <2:06*Â«) sold for 532.000,
the largest amount any trotting stal
lion has brought since Stamboul sold

City Attorney Renders an Opinion off
Interest to Members of tha
Department.
City Attorney Long yesterday ren
dered an opinion to the effect that any
disabled employe of the Fire Depart
ment is entitled to full salary only on
condition that the disability Is tempo
rary and the result of Injuries racahvad
while in the actual performance of his
duty In the departmentâ
The opinion affects the eases of
John Cannon, a hoseman, who Is suf
fering from cancer of the face, and
William Fitzsimmons, who Is afflicted
with tuberculosis, said to be the result
of a cold contracted from setting wet
at a fire on May 7. 190S. Long ad
vises the Fire Commissioners to apply
the law in consonance with his opin
ion, which is as follows:
Under the charter, as I interpret it. a fire
man Is not entitled to his salary white off
duty unless hiÂ» absence therefrom is occasioned
by a temporary disability "by reason of la
juries received while In the actual perfonn
ancÂ« of bis duty." If the disability la per
manent and the result of such Injuries th*
only relief which he may expect is provided
In the pension provisions . of the charter.
"Whether the disability b*' temporary or per
manent the fireman can have no claim either
to a salary or a pension unless It *u th*
result of Injuries received In the actual per
formance of .his duty
You are therefore advised that, in the ab
sence of a showing that John Cannon ia
suffering f rom . a temporary disability result
ins from injuries received while in the actual
performance of his. duty, he Is not entitled to
his salary. If. on the other hand, a showing
is made that he is suffering; from such ijs>
ability so received hi U eaUtltd ti*r*u.

A rapid-fire revolver match, wherein

five shots within thirty seconds, is in
cluded in the programme of the shoot.
Incidental to the priate shoot there is a
special prize for the best "center made

sented by Theodore Kjftka, the well
known revolver enthusiast.
The next event of importance in the
shooting world is the championship

President Joseph McTigue of the
San Francisco Driving Association is
authority for the statement that the
light harness meeting at Tanforan race
track this afternoon should furnish the
best racing to sulky that has been seen
here in a decade. As this will be the
closing meet of the season, all owners
with eligible horses have entered and
three good races are to be decided.
The association divided the entries in
to 2:20, 2:30 and 2:35 classes after a
long session, and not a horse will start
but seems to have a chance for first
money.
The names of such equines as Even
Vale, N. L. B., Kitty D, Lady Fal
rose, Erosmond and King V in the
2:20 trot assures that event of a rous
ing contest Racing luck and stamina
fihould enter largely into the final re
sult, for a dash between any two of the
six would be in doubt, as many im
promptu brushes on the speedway
testify. The same condition obtains in
the other races.
Marshall Ben Levy will call starters
in the first heat on the track at 1:30
o'clock and the races will be run off
as rapidly as ciÂ»cumstances will per
mit. Ample car service will be provid
ed via the San Mateo electric line,
which runs directly to the park gates
and all details for the comfort of spec
tators have been attended to. The
latest announcement of the club offi
cials is that die meeting will be held
rain or. shine. . â¢

frame of the season. The Indians were
defeated by the University of Califor
nia a week ago In a close game. Since
then they have been practicing daily
with the determination to take Stan
ford's scalp home with them. The red
skins have been greatly strengthened
by the addition of Williams, who was
fullback on the Carlisle team last year.
Williams is said to be one of the great
est fullbacks in the country and his
presence on the team gives the In
dians a bright outlook for a victory.
The cardinal team is not in the" best
of condition owing to the severe prac
tice of the week. Shields, last year's
tackle, will be tried at center for the
first time, the idea being to strengthen
Stanford's weak center trio. The lineup

running up a big score. Bernard, the
first time up, was given Thomas' only
pass, took third on Flood's two-bag
ger and scored when Smith's drive
was jugr&led. After that only two
men reached second. In the seventh
Cravath, the first up, hit for two bases,
but the next three were out. "With
two down, Doyle beat out a bunt in
the first, stole second, scoring on Shee
han's hiL Eagan's single, Lynch's
two-bagger and an out scored the for
mer in the sixth. Three Tacoma play
ers were fielded out at the plate, one
on a great throw from the field by
Cravath. In the eighth Smith made
a splendid stop of JIcLaughlin's hit,
doubling Lynch and retiring the side
with two on the sacks. Eagan, Lynch,

PORTLAND, Oct. 7. â Umpire Jack
McCarthy chartg-ed his mind about quit
ting the baseball business, and the
score of this afternoon's game â Seattle
7," Portland 3 â was the result of his re
appearance on the diamond. It was a
mighty struggle between Pitchers Hogg
and Hickey until Â¦ close decisions j
changed the aspect. Hogg had the Si
washes at his mercy for seven innings,
while the Portlands had three to the
good in the outset.
With one out and two strikes on
Mohler, the "Kid" lifted one to the
right field that netted, him three bases,
and a single brought him home. In the
next inning, on a force, Smith dashed
home, and to avoid being touched by
Stanley leaped over the home plate. He
was called safe. The Siwashes then
opened ujÂ» on Hogg and kept hammer
ing in runs. The score:
Seattle â 1 Portland^ â

CHICAGO, ' Oct. â¢ 7.â Dr. Stephens,
which was nearly backed off the boards
in the third- race,. -the. feature event at
Worth track to-day," was driven out to
the last â¢ ounce to beat the long shot.
Easy Trade. iiVIth a better boy up the
latter .would no doubt have won. Seam
ster, who rode the winner, put it all
over Foy when the final test came.
Dr. Stephens opened at 9 to 5 and
was gradually pounded to even money,
finally closing at 13 to 10.
Chanterelle; attempted to make a
runaway race of it, having a lead of
five lengths down the back stretch.
Here Dr. Stephens commenced to close
on him and entering the stretch looked
a handy winner. Easy Trade, however,
came with a rush and In a desperate
drive all through the final eighth was
only a short. head behind Dr. Stephens
when the wire was crossed.
The track was deep and holding and
slow time was made in all the events.

MORRIS PARK, Oct. 7.â Rapid
Water took Dolly Spanker Into camp
easily In the Dixiana stakes to-day at
Westchester. Rapid Water was a slight
favorite. After the race the speculators
wondered why as good as even money
was quoted against him. Dolly.Spank
er had no excuse. Shaw got him away
well and. made the running to the
stretch, where Rapid Water moved up
with ease. Dolly Spanker then stopped
badly. â¢
The Manhattan handicap, at six fur
longs down the hill, nearly furnished
the biggest kind of a. surprise. Race
King, which went to the post at 60 to 1
and which was at one time at 100 to 1,
raced to the front and led by three
lengths. He held his lead until the last
fifty yards, where Broadcloth, the sec
ond choice, got up in time to beat' the
good. thing a scant length for first
money. Castallan should have been
second, but was badly fouled by Broad
cloth and had to pull up. Burns made
no claim.

In the field the local teasi outplayed
the Champions. There was no scor

up In this tailing. He sent a siizling
User to center field dat caused the
fetr Boston "rooters" to give their
Irngs exercise. In the fifth the local
boys n:ade a luciy ran. Dougherty
lifted a high fly that fell between Par
ent anfl Selbach and had to be scored
as a two-bagger. "BDry" Keeler fol
loirefl this â¢with a pretty bunt that Col
lins coald not get. This put "Long
Pat" on third- A fe-w moments later
Dougherty tallied on ElberfeJd's long
fly to Freeman.
Dossherty also crossed the plate
e^-atn with Xew York's third and last
run. In the seventh inning he reached
first on as error by La Chance, went
to second -when Gibson allowe-d Elber
felfl to "walk and raced home on Wil

NEW YORK, OoL 7.â Before a crowd
of tea thousand excited baseball en
thusiasts Griffith's team defeated Bos
tun this afternoon at American League
Park by a score of S to 2. They took
the lead from the Champions in the
race for the American League pennant.
The victory means thai New York
has more than an even chance to win
the championship, as four more games
remain to be played with Boston. It
was only after the hardest kind of a
battle that the local men won. From
the first inning there was continual
cheerily. After the last Boston man
ws* retired thÂ« "rooters" surged upon
the field and tried t3 surround Chesbro,
the victorious t\rirler. He started on
a sprint for the clubhouse, but he had
not gone far before he was caught and
raised on the shoulders of some of the
lxiFty lunged entnnsiasts. He was car
ried to the clubhouse door before he
XV2L* tHowed to escaj>e.
Opposed to Chesbro m the box was
jnimg Gibson, who has been particu
larly effective in all his sames against
New York. The two pitchers did splen
did \rork. Chesbro having a shade the
best of the Bostonian.

The referee will be "W. R. Vanderbilt Jr. He and the members of the com
mission will wear blue "brassards," or arm badges. The judges will wear red
"brassards," the timers green and the members of the press white, with the
name of the publication they represent in black letters.
Supplies must be taken on and tires mended outside of the control. If a
car breaks down within the limits of a control it must be pushed out in any
possible way. Just outside each control there will be an encampment of tire
men, supplied with inner tubes, shoes and everything of this sort. Tires will
be filled from tanks of compressed air or from heavy rubber bags, each bag
containing enough air to Inflate one tire. '
There will be three amateur drivers in the raceâ Frank Croker, William
Wallace and S. B. Stevens. Frank Croker is the least experienced of these,
having driven about five thousand miles only in a sixty-horsepower Mercedes
car. S. B. Stevens* car may not start.as a bad crack was found in the crank
case and it was necessary to get a new one out from Germany.
So great was the crowd already gathered at headquarters to-night that
many persons were heard to say they would sit up until morning for the
good reason they had no place in which to sleep.
The utmost care has been exercised to make the race successful. To ob
viate the clouds of dust which obscure the view of the contestants and the
spectators, about $5000 has been expended in oiling the road, which is In ex
cellent condition. To keep the course clear guards, deputy sheriffs and signal
men to the number of about 175 have been engaged.
The cars will be checked and the records kept in the manner adopted In
the Paris to Madrid race, which was found to answer well. Each car will
carry a polished copper box attached to the driver's seat. The checker at the
start will drop into this box a card bearing the record of the time of start
ing. The checker at each control will drop a record card in each time the car
passes his station. A man at the finish will add a card bearing a record of
the finishing time. The boxes will be sealed and at the end of the contest will
be turned over to the officials, who will find in them the data necessary to
make up the results. In this way records cannot be lost and the work of the
checkers will be rendered comparatively light and free from chance of error.
The boxes were made in New York City, one used In the Paris to Madrid race
being taken as the model.
The judges and checkers at each of the four turns in the course and In
the controls are provided with portable telephones, by means of which they
can set into Immediate communication with the officials at the starting point.
The latter will be kept accurately informed of the progress of events without
delay and can, if necessary, render decisions on matters requiring them.
Nearly five hundred miles of telephone wire has been used and expert tele
phone inspectors and repairers will be posted at the turns and other impor
tant points. They will be provided with motor cycles, so that they may be
able to reach quickly any spot where their services may be needed. â¢
Not even the officials will be permitted to cross the track in front of the
grandstand. The road from the starting line to a point several hundred feet dis
tant will be quite clear at all times. No one, official or otherwise, except the
driver and mechanician will be allowed to approach a car on the line.
Gratification was expressed in the Garden City Hotel when A. P. Par
dington, chairman of the racing board of the American Automobile Associa
tion, leaped from his chair and spread the announcement through the
crowded corridors. There had been no doubt among the racing enthusiasts
that a favorable decision would be rendered, yet the settlement of the ques
tion, even though temporary, came as a gTeat relief.
Mr. Vanderbilt, who spent most of the day in the Brooklyn court, tried
a part of the course on his way back to the Garden City, where he ar
rived about 6 o'clock. He was with a merry party and each member was
delighted at the outcome of the legal proceedings.
Throughout the day the broad, shaded lane which leads from the Gar
den City Hotel was the scene of gayety and animation. Machine after ma
chine, each filled with a lively group, rolled up to the steps. After mid
night glaring lamps gave added plcturesqueness to the view. Meantime the
lobbies and corridors of the hotel were so thronged that passage was al
most impossible-

FRIDAY. OCTOBER 7.
REAL. ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
Britons and Americans are concerned In the
propagation of the principles of civil and polit
ical liberty throughout the globe. England
and America may be rivals In trade and com
merce, but they must be cne when it comes to
the fostering of universal liberty.
Foreign Immigration alien to Anglo-Saxon
civilization Is in some degree responsible for
the absence of Intelligent Americanism. If I
read the history of the world arlÂ»ht the
English-speaking race is the only one whicn
has shown the true genius for self-government.
E. W. Maslin spoke on "The Making
of -the American," during which he gave
statistics showing the nature and nu
merical strength of the Immigrants ar
riving in the United States. He said:
As the genius of the Anglo-Saxon has mas
tered the problems of political democracy, we
may look forward with confidence to see Eng
land and America go forward to united en
deavor to meet and solve the problems of the
future In the interest of a higher civilization.
In America and the British empire we find
more than 210.000,000 English speaking peo
ple enjoying more freedom than has ever been
possessed by any people under organized gov
ernment since the world began.
We find where the> British domination has
been extended to alien races there Is the be
ginning of an evolution toward representative
forms of government and Hie rurther exten
sion of freedom, as in India, where native
rule Is encouraged as fast as the people are
prepared for It, as Is the policy of the United
States in the Philippines.
This predominance of the principle of Anglo-
Saxon freedom has not been by force nor Is it
upheld by the strong arm of power, but rather
because it Is Ingrained in the nature of man.
The Anglo-Saxon race has lent its adminis
trative renius even to the nations of the
Orient, where it* influence is seen in the
dawning self-consciousness of China and the
awakened asolrattons of Japan.
The British and American Union had
a large gathering in the Academy of
Sciences Hall last evening, when ad
dresses were delivered by A. A. Deni
son, managing editor of the Oakland
Enquirer, and E. W. Maslin of the
Naval Customs at the Port of San
Francisco; Courtenay "W. Bennett, Con
sul General of Great Britain, and Dr.
D'Evelyn, president of the union.
The subject chosen by Mr. Denison
was "The Administrative Genius of
the Anglo-Saxon," and In beginning he
said that a political campaign, as a
rule, Is a busy time for the newspapers,
but the present campaign was not quite
so busy, as there was "no twisting of
the lion's tail for political purposes."
After reviewing the close relationship
between the two English speaking na
tions Mr. Denison said in part:
Vaudeville second part â Song and dance act.
Bert Talbot; "The Dude Coons," Lavell and
Appleton. The roaring farce, "Mush." with the
following cast of characters: The Boss, Eugene
Richards; the boy Harry O'Day; the ghost.
Charles Norton; boy bootblack. Introducing
beautiful harmonica solos. Ed Burke.
The roaring original farce, "Skinner's Hotel,
Tallapoosa, Florida"; a night station on the
Chattahoochee. Tallahassee and Pensacola Rail
road. Cast of characters: Joelah Skin
ner, the proprietor, Â«n route to bed,
Sidney 8. Peixotto; Helnrlch Schwetzenbauer.
a brewery agent, en route to Dutch Guiana,
Eugene Richards; Isaac P. W. McC. O'Rourke,
a drummer, en route to Hades, Abe Appleton;
Irving Terry, an actor, en route to a new en
gagement, Jatries Rogers; Jehosaphat Snod
grane, a farmer, en route to sell his crop of
hogs, Harry O'Day; Lord Herbert Chauncy
boy. an anarchist, en route to the Florida
water baths. Charles Norton; Johnny, a bell
boy, en route to a new Job. George Hammer;
John, another bell-boy, en route to another
Job, Gus Conlan; suddenly awakened guests,
by the rest of the company.
The chief attraction was the minstrel
show by the Columbia Park Boys* Club,
the clever youngsters giving an en
tertainment which would do credit to
professionals. In the pavilion an ex
cellent programme of songs and dances
was rendered. Special mention is due
Misses Mabel Ordway and Cecile
Cowles, who have acted as accompan
ists at the pavilion during the week.
Their services, gratuitously rendered,
were highly appreciated by all.
The entertainment, which has been in
progress for five days, will net a hand
some sum for a worthy cause. The
grounds were thronged daily, but there
was no solicitation. Visitors came and
went. If they chose to spend money
they received their money's worth in
return. If they did not care to loosen
their purse strings there was no com
plaint. On the whole the benefit has
been conducted in a manner most cre'd
itable to the teachers of the public
schools of the city and the committees
selected from their number who worked
hard and long to make it a success.
The programme In the theater yester
day was as follows:
Old-time minstrel first partâ Bones, Abe
Appleton and â¢ Eugene Richards; interlocutor.
Sidney 8. Peixotto; tambourines â Harry O"Day
and Georsre Hammer; overture. "Medley of
Ethiopian Serenaders' Choruses," Columbia
Park -Boys' Club Minstrels; comic song, "Old
Zip Coon." Harry O'Day; ballad. "Poor, Old
Slave."* Charles Norton; ballad. "Old Dog
Tray." Joseph Bernard; comic song, "Walk.
Jaw-Bone. Walk." George Hammer; ballad
duet, "Old Cabin Home." Bert Talbott and
Adolf Muhelm; comic song, â¢ "Willie's Wishes."
Eugene Richards; comic song, "Keep In the
Middle of the Road," Abe Appleton: conclud
ing with an old-time "doo-dah" walk around.
Although the weather was unpropl
tious at least six thousand persons vis
ited the Chutes yesterday afternoon
and did their share to swell the Teach
ers' Annuity and Benefit Fund. Leaden
skies presaged rain and at the hour
when afternoon pleasure-seekers usual
ly leave their houses a light rain was
falling. This did not deter the friends
of the teachers from Journeying to the
Chutes and those who did not fear the
wrath of Jupiter Pluvius were well re
warded by the excellent entertainment
in the theater and the pavilion.

NEW YORK, Oct. 5â The salient fact in
to-day's stock market was that prices did not
po dov.n. as many wrrsons were led to expect
by the action of the late market yesterday.
There was a mumentary irregularity early to
dey, but nothing like the break that the bears
had pictured to ih.Â»msÂ«!ves as a result of a
decisive downward turn with its uncovering: of
etop lofs orders and rush to make profits. The
bear element had come to regard the market
t Â» top b^avy and ready to crumble away when
the etrcng lrcpetus of the upward movement
was lost. They became suspicious this morn-
Ing that the friends of higher prices had en
couraged the ehort e^llins yesterday on ac
count ot the support which would be assured to
the mexket when the shoru were covered. The
rositlve pressure on the market proved in
significant, and the bears retr^atr-d and covered
: : > r Â».\ori*. A fairly comprehensive advance in
prices followed. In the list of strong stocks
were found representatives of about all the
principal irroups cf stocks. The average gain
Â«u ircderate and tbe volume of transactions
fell considerably below those of yesterday. The
movement In Amalgamated Copper was di
rectly attributable to the active demand for
copper both hÂ»re and in Europe. The buying
cf stock W8s en a large scale, and Its rise was
<â¢*? Fome sympathetic effect on the steel stocks,
cwing to the sympathetic bond between the
two markets for the products. The advance in
some of the other industrials seemed to be due
directly to sympathy â¢with the movement In
Air.alcarr.ated Copper, and especially that in
sugar. St. Paul recovered sharply from yester
day's treak without favorable rumors regard
ing a Northern Securities settlement.
Revised Â«?*>ti mates In favor of larger grain
yield? were prevalent and helped the market.
The currency movement up to Thursday even

the situation Is not a strong one and prices
will, we think, ultimately go lower."
In this market futures were lower. The cash
grain was easier and quieter, with larger offer
ings, and moVe disposition to sell. The mar
ket has not declined with the Chicago and
North Pacific markets, ae it has been below
them right along, and they have now got down
to about our basis, which gives us a chance
to do business again, as all three markets
are now about o n a level. Futures recovered
from the early morning depression as the fore
noon advance, and closed firm with good
trading.

OATSâ The feature of the market at the
moment is the offering by Chicago of some 2000
tons of No. 1 clipped Eastern Oats delivered j
en this market, at ?l 60 per ctl. Samples of |
these Eastern Oats are now showing ,on |
â¢Change, and It is reported that some have*.
already been bought. To what dimensions
i tins- moNement will develop remains to be
I s-:in. Thest Oats came via Tacoma, and the
cÂ«uÂ«e t-t the movement Is the demand for cars
up north to move Northern Wheat to Chicago.
T'i~ ii:.roadB do not want to haul empty cars
from the West to Oregon and Washington, so
have g^en Oat importers a cut of *3 20 per
ten in ri.il rates, to enable them to bring their
cars loaded with Oats to the Coast. The Chl
capo warket is quoted heavy with large stock*.
and tftculative buying there ls not large nor
of a character to impart any prospective
strength to the market. Years ago we used j
! to import Oats from Western points, but npth
i ir.g ha* been den* in this line for a good many I
year* until now.
TliR lo^al situation shows no other new fea

etlll badly congested with rain-damaged stock,
however, which continued to drag at 25*f5oc
per small box or crate. Fine Muscats in large
boxes did better, selling up to *l 23 per box,
but for the general run of supplies %\ was
about the top. Wine Grapes were more
active than previously and wera held at a
higher range of prices, as most dealers were
of the opinion that the rain would lessen the
receipts. Orchard fruits were In good supply
and aside from a decline in Plums and Figs
there was nothing new to report, trade being
of lair volume and supplies ample. Melon*
wera dull owing to the Inclement weather and
only the fanciest Nutmegs showed any firm

The BfcW Tcrk circular of Henry Clews s*yÂ«:
'No adverse influences have developed In ,
th* situation. The crop killers have lost their I
vocation, and while the yield of corn, cotton
and wheat is below early estimates, which ls
the almost ur.broken rule, ttill a liberal sup
rly of com and cotton is practically assured, j
end so far as wheat is com*rm*d this country ]
is likely to f>cure compensation in high prices
tor the 100.000,000 bushels which it seems able
to Fpare for export. A very f ncoura*rlr.g fea
ture ls the continued growth of bank clear
ings. which is not entirely attributable to Stock
Exchange operations. Another pood feature j
is â¢the improvement in railruad -earnings. In I
the e^cond week of Srptember *3 railroads re
ported a gain of over 6 per cent, and in the
first WFfk fifty roads announced a gain of over
4 r*r cent. These returns, which have been
steadily graining, substantiate the hopeful
views recently expressed by railroad mana- |
Rers. besides demonstrating the increased ac
tivity of pcr.Â»ral bupin^ss. Of the latter there
is no question, although it is strictly confined
to moderate proportione. Iron and steel ma
terial* have been in much better demand eince j
the revision of prices, and while profits must j
bt- on a much srr.sUler scale j=till the advantage j
to producers lÂ« reflected in the. recent rise of
the steel issues.
THE MONETARY SITUATION'.
Â¦Â¦Thfre if nothing: in the monetary situation
to caus<? untia?inÂ«"e.Â« at pref<nt. While the
Gineiuuicst is facing; a. Treasurj' d^flnit. which
may eventually cause a reduction of deposits
with the d< po? itarj- banks, such action is not
yet in *:pbt. The national banks nf the en
tire country, which number about 5000. show
an increase in cash reserves for the year end
lOC S<;t>mbor "7 of $l(i7.000,Q0<J â almutst all
in pc\<l coin. Increased rold oertiflcates have
klao betn Issued by the United States Treasury
Â¦iuiir.jr the same period, amounting to $20,
â¢UU.000, thus makin* $i:iC.OOO.(XiO increase in
the gold money of the country in circulation.
In the local market easy rates prevail in Fjrtte
of crop demands and the expectation of a poor
bank taatement this week. The surplus re
â¢unc ha* betn cut In half, yet If 6tUl double
that of a ynar asa end tnor* than ample for
all probable* rÂ«o.uir*ments this fall. '
"The peneral soundness cf busine.Â«Â» and fin
an<:al conditions, as well as the almost com
plete abtmce of disturbing lÂ«ties. leaves the
market open to further manipulation; and
sin-, the interests of those in control are in
th- direction of higher price* the probabilities
are that the rite has not reached ita climax.
V t ;:r.:il the large holders have lightened their
burden, or until less favorable conditions de
\Â«i<!.. U the market likely to eee any eerlous
weakness. Moderate reactions may be expect
ed, followed, however, by substantial rallies
as long as rre*Â«ent forces govern. Purchaser!
therÂ«fore will still have to exercise much cau
tion and discrimination."

young fowls which were in limited supply,

up at the close. A car of Western was mar
keted, making the fourth for the week, and
the receipts of domestic stock were about
70 coop3. Game was unchanged.

CHICAGO, Oct. 7. â SiCT3 of weakness were
manifested in the wheat market at the imme
diate opening. Sentiment among pit traders
generally showed an inclination to favor the
bear side 01 the ' market. ' This reversal of
recent existing conditions was due chiefly to
a belief by many traders that the present lib
eral rate of wheat deliveries In the North
west was likely to continue for a month or
more. Additional incentive to sell was fur
nished by the weak tone of cables. Initial
quotations showed slight losses, December be
ing unchanged to Me lower, .at SiiO9iÂ£@l OB%.
May was a shade to %Â«f!ic lower at $1 <w>
1 09%. Large receipts in the Southwest start
ed active selling by houses with Southwestern
connections. This was followed by profit tak
ing on the part of numerous small longs,
who were afraid to hold lines over the holi
days. Practically the only demand came from
shorts. Buyinir to cover shorts" sales was
not of sufficient volume to absorb offerings.
In consequence prices readily declined. A re
port by a St. Louis trade paper, stating that
no complaints of consequence had been received,
brourht out additional selling. Late in the
day a rally of about a cent occurred on buying
by shorts, December closing at $1 0Sl4Â®l 08%.
Final quotations on May were at $1 0Â»@l 09VÂ».
Extreme weakness prevailed In the corn
market as a result of continuous liquidation
on the part of local traders. â¢ December opened
?ic to He lower and closed l^c lower at
48%c.
The weakness of wheat and corn had com
paratively little effect on the oats market,
prices showing only a slight decline. Decem
ber closed at 3OU@3O%c.
Provisions were affected by the break in
grain prices, the market becoming weak during
the latter part of the session. Selling by local
holders was the cause of the weakness. At the
close January pork was down 25<9 l 27i4c; lard
was down 12VjC.

The appeal case of Charles Buckley
and Arthur Murphy, deputy pound
keepers, convicted by Police Judge
Fritz of cruelty to animals and fined
$20 each, was argued before Judge
Cook yesterday. The Judge affirmed
the judgment of the lower court and
in doing so said: "A poundman
should know before he tries to capture
a dog whether or not it has a tag. If
he does not know, then he makes the
attempt at his peril. If in trying 'to
capture a dog with a tag on he should^
maim or kill the canine .he renders
himself liable for damages to the
owner."
On March 14 Captain W. C. Overton
of the Presidio was driving on Van
Ness avenue in a buggy with his wife.
His dog was running along- under the
vehicle. Buckley and Murphy made
several attempts to capture the dog,
although Captain Overton pointed out
to them that it had a tag. In so do-
Ing they injured one of the animal's
legs by striking it with the pole at
tached to the net. They were ar
rested for cruelty to animals and con
victed and fined on March 23.

It is only a few months ago that
three brakemen on the "north end,"
between Salinas and this city, were ar
rested for the same work and it is now
expected that an end will be put to the
looting of cars by employes for some
time to come.
John C. Weston and Frank Rixey,
Southern Pacific brakemen, are in the
City Prison waiting their transfer to
Santa Barbara, where three charges of
grand larceny will be preferred against
them. W. E. Lynch of the 'firm of
Lynch & Meyers, saloon-keepers, Santa
Barbara, is under arrest there on a
charge of receiving stolen property.
Weston and Rixey have been in the
service of the Southern Pacific - Com
pany since 1901. They were employed
as brakemen on freight trains on the
"south end," between Salinas and
Santa Barbara. For the last two years
the company has been receiving claims
for goods shipped but not delivered.
Two months ago Detective Peter Lewin
of the company's staff was detailed on
the case. He went to Santa Barbara
and procured the assistance of Chief of
Police Ross.
After a patient investigation suspi
cion fell upon Weston and Rixey and
it was discovered later that Lynch had
been acting as a "fence" for them.
Lynch employed a man named Theo
dore Butgenbach as a traveling sales
man to dispose of the goods stolen by
the two brakemen. Butgenbach was. a
salesman for E. Hillman & Co., a
wholesale tobacco house in Santa Bar
bara. The chief part of the plunder
consisted of cigars and liquors and of
these whole cases were stolen. Other
articles were silk goods, shotguns, cam
eras and typewriters.
Lewin and Chief Ross recovered a
quantity of the stolen cigars in Lynch's
house in Santa Barbara and in a saloon
owned by J. Frediani. A* thorough
search is still being made for more of
the stolen property. Lewin says that
Lynch has made a full confession.
Weston is a married man and lived
in San" Luis Obispo. Rixey boarded
with him. Weston opened a bank ac
count and has several hundred dollars
to his credit. It is estimated that the
total value of the goods stolen will
reach from JSOOO to $10,000. The way
they worked the scheme was to remove
the seal from a car with a pair of nip
pers. After opening the car door and
Â¦removing the goods they would again
carefully affix the seal.
Weston was arrested at Third and
Townsend streets at the request of. the
superintendent of the division on Oct
ober 3 by Detective Ryan of the local
police and Detective Kipdelon of the
Southern Pacific. Rixey was arrested
at the same place, on Thursday by De
tective Ryan and Detective Lewin.
Each when arrested had a suit case
containing stolen cigars and liquor.

Albert Mahony will not have to be
tried on the charge of presenting a
fraudulent salary demand when he
was County Clerk, according to a de
cision rendered by the Supreme Court
yesterday. His demurrer to the in
dictment of the Grand Jury is sus
tained and by reason of a technical
error he will escape prosecution.
The specific offense with which Ma
hony was charged* was the cashing of
,a warrant drawn in favor of A. Da
vidson, who is said by some to have
visited the City Hall years ago. but
by others it is alleged that he had
seen it only from Market street. At
any rate, he did not work in the Coun
ty Clerk's office, but was collecting
$100 a month.
The Grand Jury indicted .Mahony.
but he alleged that the complaint did
not state facts sufficient to constitute
cause of action. His stand Is upheld.

The following were present:
Newton J. Thorp supervised the dec
orations. The simple beauty of the
scheme was greatly admired. The cen
ter of the table was a mass of rose
chrysanthemums. Gold fish swam in
water contained in an elevated col
umn of glass. Softened light descended
from electric globes placed in an arbor
of oak leaves over the table.
A delightful dinner in compliment to
James D. Phelan, president of the Bo
hemian Club, was given last evening

"Nay. nay." he said: "I don't have
to work. The world owes me a living,
and I propose to collect the debt with
out descending: to toil."
He repeated the sentiment when
placed before Judge Ccnlan for trial
<^n the charge of defrauding an inn
keeper, and without hesitancy his
Honor gave him three months' impris
onment. "The taxpayers of San Fran-
Richard Fowler ate an expensive
dinner in the restaurant of John Chris
tian and then calmly pleaded inability
to pay for it. Mr. Christian consid
erately offered him menial employment
In the kitchen, but Mr. Fowler declined
without thanks.
Nor did G. A. Cummings display re-
Fpect for the law's requirements when
he started to build a block of fiats on
Sacramento street, near Spruce, wita
<>ut having legal permission to do so.
Between the times of his arrest and
his appearance before Judge Mogan
he obtained the requisite permit, and
he was dismissed with a caution.
Somewhat similar disregard for the
rights of citizens was exhibited by
John V>rs, who blockaded the Post-
Btreet car tracks for twenty-seveit
minutes and delayed no less than six
carloads of passengers, while he
calmly unloaded bricks from his
wagon. He ignored alike the anathe
mas and implorations of the car crews
and faithfully obeyed the instructions
of a hodcarrier who desired to have
the bricks placed where he could most
handily pet them. Mr. Vers was fined
?20 by Judge Mogan.
MIciael Santry, plasterer, also
showed a lack of respect for other peo
ple's rights by utilizing as a mortar
bed the entire sidewalk fronting a
house on Sacramento street, between
Laguna and Octavia, thus compelling
pedestrians to walk upon the roadway
until they passed the obstruction.
"I did It," Mr. Santo* explained to
Judge Mogan, "because the policeman
en that beat never told me that I
chould not do It."
"On the same line of reasoning,"
commented his Honor, "I suppose, you
Â¦would commit suicide if a policeman
tailed to advise you to remain alive."
Sentence to-day.

"Ton had no right to destroy this
complainant's property," said the
court. "I will sentence you to-mor
row."
"I didn't think it was unlawful." he
replied. "Before the fence was erected
1 used to go across the lot and thus
s&ve about a block of walking dis
tance, and when the graders blockaded
State street I found that I would have
to walk an extra block in order to get
to rny homa. Then I made the short
cut."
When the grading contractors
blocked State street and made it incon
venient fur Maurice O'Neill to pass to
and from his home. No. S7, on the ob
structed thoroughfare, he Uid not at
tt-miJt either to climb over or to re
inove the obstructions, but procured
an ax .ind chopped down portions of
the fence surrounding a lot leased by
Mrs. Hannah Scott, widow, of 4060A
Seventeenth street, and thus made
clear passageway for himself and fam
ily. Widow Scott then had him 'ar
rested for malicious mischief.
"Why did you do such an unlawful
thing?" Judge Mogan asked Mr.
O'Neill.
Patrolman Nelson, however, disput
ed the claim of sobriety and the case
went over for further hearing to-day.
Kittle Brown and Estelle May
chewed gum industriously as they
stood up before Judge Mogan to ex
plain their reason for loitering at Pa
cific and Kearny streets very early
yesterday morning. They had evident
ly taken especial pains with their
toilet, for fresh pinks nestled In Miss
Brown's frizzy coiffure and Miss May
wore'a corsage bouquet of mixed roses.
"We were just taking a walk." Miss
Brown informed the court, "and I
think this officer had very, little to
do when he arrested us."
"Me and Kittle are chums, you
know," Miss May explained, '.'and its
funny .â that sober ladies can't take a
walk without being arrested."
"Keep that $5 bail money," wrote K.
F. Martin, arrested for sleeping in
Union Square last Wednesday night.
"It's not worth bothering about. It
may Interest you to know that I sleep
out of doors because my doctor has
ordered me to take the fresh-air cure."
The bail money was accordingly for
feited.
Â« â¢ â¢ â¢
Disinterested witnesses proved the
complaint, however, and as their tes
timony trickled the eyes of Mr. Stev
enson showed only white.
Frank Stevenson, a negro, was pro
nounced guilty of disturbing the peace*
of William Marks, a 72-year-old white
man, with whom he lived in the same
house on Stark street, and Judge Mo
gan will sentence him to-day. The
complainant testified that the defend
ant persecuted him in various ways,
such as swearing at him.
"Fo* do lub ob hebbin, doan yo*
b'lieve no sech stoary as dat, Jedge,"
Mr. Stevenson exclaimed. "Ise a mem
bah ob <Je church, I is, an' nebbah
sweah at no pusson. Xo, sah; Ise
couldn't cuss eben ef Ise wanted ter."
Joe Mulhatton, charged with stealing
a coat from Henry Wantz, proprietor
of a Clay street lodging-house/ was sent
to the Insanity Commissioners by'Judgc
Mogan, before whom he proved himself
either a most unscrupulous prevari
cator or an accomplished portrayer of
human dementia. He disclaimed recol
lection of stealing the coat, and un
blushlngly declared that it was his own
coat, and not the one stolen from
Wantz, that he was wearing when a
policeman found him leading worship
at a Salvationist meeting, although
there was positive evidence to the con
trary. The coat which was found in the
place the Wantz garment was stolen
from contained in its pockets several
letters addressed to Mulhatton, yet he
ingenuously averred that he had never
seen the garment before.
"Your guilt has been clearly estab
lished," said the Judge to the defend
ant, "but your denials lead me to sus
pect that your mind Is unbalanced.
Were you ever in an asylum for the in
sane?"
"I was confined four months in the
lunatic asylum at Phoenix, Ariz.," was
the answer. "My head was injured in
a mine accident, and since then I have
had several relapses of insanity."
Two of the letters aforementioned
were addressed to Mulhatton's married
sister at Washington. D. C, and in
formed her that he was organizing
"The Soul-saving Soldiers of 'America,"
to work along the lines pursued by the
Salvation Army and its established riv
als. If the Lunacy Commission find
that he is not a fit subject for an asy
lum he will be sent to the Superior
Court to answer the burglary charge
on which he was arrested.
â¢ â¢ â¢
H. F. Martin, accused of vagrancy,
told such a convincing story to a couple
of shrewd Police Court lawyers that
they bailed him out for ?5, and then he
walked out of Judge Mogan's court
room and disappeared while they were
in quest of a mythical bank book which
he had said could be found at a certain
place. He has not since been seen, and
Bailiff Hickey offers odds of five to one
that the attorneys will never recover
their money. A bench warrant is out
for his capture.
H. J. Woods, arrested for vagrancy,
informed Judge Mogan that he recently
arrived from Australia, is a profession
al artist and makes a specialty of por
traits in black and white. His artistic
endeavor has been confined to sketch
ing the heads of ladies of the tender
loin, he added, and he found the noc
turnal hours most convenient for the
handling of his subjects. That's how
he came to be seen entering and emerg
ing from disreputable houses at all
times of night.
"If you are an artist." said Judge
Mogan, "the profession has no reason
to be proud of you. But my opinion is
that you're a shabby genteel loafer,
and it will afford me pleasure to send
you to jail to-morrow."
Charles "Wilson. Con Sheehan and H.
A. Hansen were promenading Kearny
street when the latter gentleman be
came involved in a dispute with Chin
Jim as to which of them had right of
priority to a certain portion of the side
walk. Mr. Hansen struck Chin Jim,
and some of the assaulted one's com
patriots went to his aid, whereupon
Wilson and Sheehan "mixed in." and
the racial war was a merry one when
the three Caucasians were arrested.
Judge Cabaniss fined Mr. Hansen, the
original aggressor, $15, taxed Mr. Wil
son $5 and discharged Mr. Sheehan.

DECEPTION
Â¦ #
Every city teems with unprincipled grocers
who recommend cheap counterfeits of high-
grade goods with the assurance that they are
just as good as the genuine. There is greater
profit in selling imitationsâ therefore the decep-
tion. Unscrupulous imitators are placing in-
ferior brands of chocolate and cocoa on the
market w.th the direct intention of misleading
the public. They are marketing their goods,
which they do not even manufacture, upon the
good name of tha D. Ghirardelli Co. These par-
ties, in conjunction with dishonest grocers, are
seeking to trade on the iifty years' reputation
of honest manufacturing and advertising of
D. Ghirardelli. Suit is now pending for the
suppression of these substitutions and the
protection of the public.
Insist upon gelling the .original and genuine
