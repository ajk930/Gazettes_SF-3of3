"It has been pointed out that the

United States, caused by war expendi
tures, have reached $28,000,000, and now
the United States has used this gold
to pay for American participation In
the Japanese loan floated in London.
But. as It happened, the London
market was in a position where It was
forced to send the gold to Paris, in
the course of exchange.
"To avoid drafts on its own gold re
serves, London, instead of taking for
itself the gold about to leave the
United States, directed it to Paris.
"The precise result is that, as Paris
was then establishing a Russian gold
credit on a basis of its loan. Japan's
gold has been placed at the disposal bt
the Russian Government."

A thorough sifting of rumors and re

there are 4000 Russians between here
and the Tumen River, about half of
' them mounted Cassacks. An unfound

\ are within twenty miles, and this has

j consternation and excitement. Such a

i seen, even at Pingyang.
Eight hundred infantry and no cav
alry or artillery whatever is the total
Japanese garrison at Gensan, and
these are the only troops Japan main
tains on the eastern Korean coast. The
lack of cavalry prevents effective
scouting. The infantry Is useless
against- the mobile Cossack bands

for 200 miles to the north.

LIAOYAN'G, June 12.â Ensign Marilo,
who has returned from . the battle of
Saimatsza. fought on June 7, says that
the Japanese lost about 300 men.
He speaks in the highest terms of the
work of the Red Cross doctors, Poosen
a.nd Bontesh, who attended the wound
ed under flre. When the order came
to retire these doctors refused to leave
the station until the last of the wound
ed had been brought out and attended
to.
After the battle a wounded Russian
was found with his tongue- cut out.
There Is a general disinclination to
attribute this mutilation to the Japan
ese, after the kindness which they had
previously shown to the Russian
wounded, and it is believed to be more
probable that it was the work .of Chi
nese bandits.
It is alleged that during the engage
ment the Japanese again misused the
Rod Cross by getting within 400 yards
urder its cover and then firing vol
leys.
Reports of the Siuyen fight of June
8 say that the Japanese lost 100 killed
and the Russians one killed and twen

On May 13 a party of recruits for
Dowle's Zion City, near Chicago, ar
rived fn Sydney from South Australia-
There were sixty-three men. women
aztA children, comin? mostly from Ade- â¢

several **ovÂ«rseerÂ«~ and pastors and
expected to tafl for Vancouver Is a
few days. They were apparently of the
Cape May Editor Drowned.
CAPE MAT, N. J., June 12. â E. A.
Streavig. aged about 20 years, editor
of the Cape May Wave, was drowned
In the ocean to-<lay while bathing.
His home was in Hanover, Pa.
Mr. Cole in speaking of wireless
telegraphy said:
"Our experiments to-day with Yerba
Buena were entirely successful. I should
have attempted ta have communicated
earlier with the harbor, but in the
heavy storm we passed through during
the last few days our aerial cage was
blown down, and the succession of gales
prevented us from putting it up again
until this morning. The moment it was
again in working order I began signal-
Ing, with the result as stated. The at
mospheric conditions on the California
coast are simply perfect for our demon
strations.
"In and about Panama, however, the
conditions are very bad. and our ex-
periment3 were thereby not what we
should have liked to have had them.
We have been talking from here to
Mare Island all the morning, and with
the greatest ease. "We are using the
Slaby-Arco system. Waves fronj tnis
machine travel at the rate of IS"* miles
a second. The transformer we are us
ing- is caoable of generating 130.000
volts. We can use both the Continental
and Morse codes."
Captain Dlehl will leave the Boston
on the 13th inst. He goes to Washing
ton to act as judge advocate general
of the navy.
Commander John Hubbard will re
lieve Captain Diehl in command of the
Boston.
The resolution, on being put to the
meeting, was carried unanimously, and
the gathering, which was a very or
derly one, dispersed.
One of the speakers made reference
to the employment of Chinse labor on
the cable steamer Iris. J. K. Kneen.
secretary of the Auckland branch of
the Seamen's Union, in supporting the
resolution regarding the Transvaal
question, said that New Zealand should
put her own house In order. There
was. he said, a vessel lying In the
Auckland harbor at the present time
which was manned in the stokehold by
Chinese, who were paid the wage of
30s a month, and yet this vessel re
ceived a subsidy from our government,
as well as from the commonwealth
ar.d .Canadian governments. He stated
that he had received a message from
J. C. Watson, the Premier of the com
monwealth, . stating that the employ
ment of these Chinese was contrary to
a clause in the federal constitution,
and that he intended to bring the mat
ter before the federal Parliament at
an early date, with a view to prevent
ing any 'further subsidy being paid un
der the present conditions. He moved.
"That this meeting protests against the
New Zealand Government giving any
furhter subsidy to this vessel while
It is manned by Chinese."
The resolution was carried unani
mously.
A Chinese merchant and his bride
arrived at Wellington from China, via
Sydney, by the Victoria on Friday.
The lady, who was handsomely attired
in her national, costume, attracted a
good deal of attention outside the Gen
eral Postofflce, where she- awaited in
an enclosed cab -the return of her
husband from the Customs. Fourteen
of her fellow countrymen, five of whom
were new chums, also arrived by the
same vessel, and the five had to pay
Â£100 each as poll tax before bets*; per
mitted to remain tn the colony.
Messrs. P. vE. Cheal, F. E. Baume.
M. H. R., R. F. Way. P. G. Andrew.
W. P. Black (a member of the Trades
and Labor Council), W. B. Fowler. A.
Rosser and J. K- Kneen made short
but forcible soeeches in favor of the
resolution.
Tha.t this macs vr.eetir.tr of citizens of Auck
land enters a most emphatic protest ajralnst
the importation of AslaUc labor Into the Trans
vaal, believta* that wr do Â«o endangers the
stability of the empire, and is unfair to the
white and colored subjects of the emsire al
ready ia South Africa.
The chairman, in opening the pro
ceedings, said that so long as the policy
of introducing Chinese labor into the
Transvaal mines was persisted in it
would always be competent for white
people to protest against it- G. Fowlds.
M. H. R-, made an address and then
submitted the following resolutions:
OPPOSED TO ASIATICS.
artisan class for the most part, though
there was a sprinkling of men used to
lighter occupations, such as clerks, etc.
All were vrell dressed and comfortable
looking, and the character of the crowd
was further Indicated by the quantity
and style of their luggage, which was
superior to that of the class to Trliion
one would take them to belong.
The public sentiment expressed in the
several cities of Australia against the
introduction of Chinese Labor Into the
Transvaal mines finds an echo in New
Zealand. On Saturday, May 14, an
cpen air meeting of citizens, called un
der the auspices of the Auckland
Trades and Labor Council, for the pur
pose of protesting against the introduc
tion of Chinese labor into the Transvaal
mines, was held at the Junction of
Queen and Grey streets on Saturday
evening. K. Boyd, president of the
Trades and Labor Council, presided,
and there was a good attendance
throughout the meeting, which lasted
for an hour and a half.

The United States cruiser Boston,
which arrived in port yesterday, again
proved the practical value of wireless
telegraphy. When i twenty-five miles
south of the Gclden Gate she sent . a
message to Yerba Buena announcing
her approach. It was promptly re
ceived, understood and acknowledged
by the station at that point.
The Boston came into port at 10:30

OP INTEREST TO PEOPLE
OF THE PACIFIC COAST
There is little chance of the company
receding from the position It has taken,
and many of the strikers are anxiously
waiting the result of the threatened
strike order "from New York to San
Francisco." They elaijn such an order
will benefit them greatly, as that will
tie up every road on the coast.
There are S00 union freight handlers
in San Francisco. Of that number 350
have been in the employ of the South
ern Pacific, and the balance with the
Santa Fe ar.d the local roads. The
Southern Pacific men are the only ones
on strike at present, but the union, men
gay that the freight handlers on other
roads will soon be called out.
EXPECT GENERAL TIE-UP.
The strikers also claim that their de
mands for the increase in wages are
based to aa extent on the work they
perform being expensive to those that
live at regular boarding-houses, owing
to the uncertainty of the hours cf la
bor. The strikers say they would be
willing to work for the 22H ce%ts an
hour if the company would furnish
their meals, as is being done in the
present condition.
'According to the rules of the com
pany no overtime ia allowed unless
twenty minutes of any, half-hour is
worked. The union men claim that in
many instances they have worked two
hours and fifteen minutes, for which
they would only be allowed twp hours.
In such instances men that were board
ing would be compelled to go to a res
taurant for their suppers, when In real
ity their meals were already paid for
or charged against them. This feature
is one of the particular reasons given
by the union for demanding the in
crease.
There was no freight loaded at the
Southern Pacific sheds yesterday,
though there were great quantities re
ceived for shipment on Saturday. The
non-union men that are employed in
place of the strikers were allowed to
stop wcrk at T o'clock Saturday night,
but will resume loading this morning.
At the union headquarters it was said
seventy cf the non-union men would
not return to work this morning, as
they had all of the Job they wanted.
The officials at the sheds say less than
thirty men have quit, and cf that num
ber the majority were undesirable
hands. There are sufficient men to
handle the freight, and the company
expects to have no trouble about keep
ing the sheds clear.
The Ainion men claim it is costing the
company fylly twice aa much to retain
the non-union m^n as it would to al
low the demands of the union and pay
the 25 cents an hour a?ked for by the
strikers. They base that statement on
the extra number of men necessary to
perform the work and the additional
cost of maintaining the dining- depart
ment and the sleeping quarters.
REASON* FOR STRIKE.
During the fire an ambulance surgeon
was stationed near by to care for the
firemen, whose eyes^ caused them in
tense rain after each rush into the
smoke.
The damasa to the restaurant wa3
S10O.0CO. The upper floors of the build
ing were occupied by wholesale mil
liners, and the loss on their stock, which
was practically ruined by the smok?,
is also placed at J1C0.C00.
NEW YORK, June 12.â Thirty fire
men were temporarily overcome by to
bacco smoke and fumes from alcohol
early to-day while fighting a fire la
Foul's cafe, on Broadway. The fire was
confined to the stsb-cellar, in which
liquors and cigars were stored, and the
fuinea and the dense smoke from the
burning cfsars hindered the flrecea to
such aa extent that they were com
pelled to wcric in two-minute relays.

* COUNCIL FOR DEFENSE.
When the question came before the
Senate last year Senator Dawjon was
strongly opposed to a proposal to es
tablish an Australian Council of De
fense. Since then, however, the Minis
ter for Defense has changed his mind.
He states now that he is favorable to
the establishment of a council, although
he had not yet reached any definite de
cision on the matter.
A statement prepared at the Instance
of the Postmaster General shows the
weights of the mail matter dispatched
from the several States in 1302 by the
ocean mail service, with the proportion
of subsidy. It la as follows:
International correspondence dis
patched:
It Is beccmisc clearer month by month aa
the artltraticn court extends Its jurisprudence
that the employer of lahcr ts nobody In par
ticular. He may fancy that, as the owner cf
mach machinery and the Investor of a great
deal ot capital, he has Tertaln freedom and
some rigtta and privileges. A particular ma
chin*. for Instance, may be Intended to do a
stateii quantity of work, and on buying It he
may assume that he wtU be entitled to say at
what sp**d It shall run and how many men
shall lock after It.
But this ts all a myth IT we may believe Mr.
Jostle* Cchen. The employer Is practically the
humble servant of the emplaye â with the Arbi
tration Court as timekeeper. Mr. Justice Co
hen remarited yesterday. In reply to Dr. Cul
l^n. who protested against an employer beimr
forced to employ mere men T*Â»n he required
on any machine, that It was all a mistake to
suppose that there could be freedom la the
mattpr. The Industrial history cf the last half
csntsry had altogether nesaxired thÂ« conten
tion that employers could control thelj business
as they liied. "In all parts of the world
unions of employes force-l the employers into
ail sorts cf agreements ...â¢< to conditions of la
bor." That wan held to settle the matter. Be
cause the uniona have been aWe to follcw a
certain coarse durtsff the last fifty yÂ»ars It
must be quite r-.ght, and noboiy Is to utter a
word. That Is t-j say. might is risht. and Mr.
Justice Coii-*n is i^.. rb:-i to advertise hlm.Â»Â»lf
as th* humble servant of miirht. On the same
principl* 't may happen that picketicc â per
sua?ivÂ» picSceting wtta revolvers and bludgwjnsi
â will be declared right during; th# nt?Â« hjjf
century; and. finally. thÂ» man with a pound
in his pocket will be declared aa enemy of the
State. It is auiTe eipiif-abie, cf course, now
that â¢â¢Socialism tn Our Time" Is the labor bat
tie cry. and "Down With the Capitalist" a

and until recently a resident of San
Francisco, died * alone to-day, in the
little house in. the rear of 819 Market

referred to the Coroner. Last night
she came home, cheerful and In ap
parently good health. This morning
her neighbor, Mrs. Laura Tyler, was
attracted by a rapping upon the wall
of the house. She replied and found
Mrs. Mitchell In great pain. Dr. Strat

larvae, that is. the larvae produced by
artificial treatment of the element In
which the animal lives, originates from
regularly segmenting, eggs.
Heretofore there was doubt upon

because of its small area.. There are
but "few tracts of land' nOw undivided
in the city from which a park could be
made and this is being urged as a rea

Some t>art of the money needed will
come from the members of the settle
ment themselves. A fee of 10 cents a
month has heretofore been charged the
children, but this may be raised to 25
cents, so that the settlement will be in
a measure self-supporting. In the past
the money received from fees^ was used
for monthly entertainments, e
There were 200 children connected
with the. settlement, and during the
college year forty students from the
University of California gave them in
struction without cost. The Influence of
the settlement for good cannot be esti
mated, and it has had a special value
in preparing and disciplining the chil
dren for the public schools in the dis
trict. Instruction was given the chil
dren in all the arts and crafts. The In
struction helped to bring out the
artistic side of their natures, as well as
to give them a preliminary training in
the practice of useful employments. A
gathering . place was provided for the
children, and mothers overburdened
with household duties. kpew of a place
of safe-keeping for them. In a word,
the settlement was a blessing to West
Berkeley families, and its ennobling in
fluence will be greatly missed unless the
movement to endow it with new life is
successful.
A movement has been started .to se
cure funds with which to continue the
work of the West Berkeley Social Set
tlement, from which Mrs. Phoebe A.
Hearst " withdrew a large part of her
support a week ago. Hart Greensfelder,
one of the resident workers at the set
tlement, is at the head of the effort,
and he has been promised the support
of a. number of well-to-do people.
It is estimated that it will cost $2500
a year to keep the work of .the settle
ment going. This will pay the salaries
of two or three people and purchase the
material used by the children. There
will be nothing to pay on account of
the buildings, as Mrs. Hearst has gen
erously turned these over to the people
In charge of them. Mrs. Hearst has
also said that she would contribute the
salary of the head resident worker,
Miss Margaret Sherwood, for a year,
besides paying all the necessary ex
penses incidental to the transfer of the
property, so that the people interested
in the settlement will be relieved of a
large part of the financial burden for
a while at least.
In order to secure the necessary money
it is proposed to make a systematic
canvass. Promises of money have al
ready ' been secured by Mr. Greens
felder from friends of the settlement*
and many' people are expected to con
tribute regular monthly sums to the
cause. If necessary the services of
well-known lecturers will be secured
and the proceeds from their efforts
turned over to the fund. . â¢Â¦>â¢

Miss Conners, who Is a beautiful

said that she was a native of San

tives living there now. The young
woman did not exhibit any indications
of a disordered mind until the train
pulled into' the mole. Before leaving
her car she attracted the attention of
the other passengers by declaring that
she was being pursued by Colorado
strikers. An officer was summoned
and ordered that Miss Conners be taken
to the Receiving Hospital, which was
done by Brakeman W. J. O'Neill of
the Southern Pacific Company. Prior
to being removed from the train the
yc-ung woman was presented with a
purse that had been raised among her
fellow passengers, who took pity on her
plight. â¢- : --'i~
Miss Conners probably will be ex

had beon in Cripple Creek and what she
was doing- there, the young woman
made no answer. She likewise refused
to state if she had any relatives or
friends in Los Angeles.

The interef-ts of the Republican party are
paramount to any personal Interests or de
sires, and I will support Mr. Ella for the posi
tion he neeks. G. E. MILXES.
Further. I desire to etate that under no cir
cumstances will 1 be t candidate for the As
sembly before the Republican county conven
tion. Mr. E!1f has served with credit and dis
tinction, not only to himself, but the people he
represents, and as the people of Richmond
claim Mr. Ells as their representative they
should have him.
It is my firm opinion that each section of
the county is entitled to recognition, and if the
people of the western end want Mr. Ells, their
request should be granted by the Republicans.
The best interest of the party should always be
looked at; this is the only way these matters
should be considered.
SincÂ« then the peojil* of the western end of
the county, including the towns of Richmond
and Stege. have asked that Mr. Ells make an
other run and serve a second term in the As
sembly, believing that he will be of still
greater value to the people of the county in
his eecond term than in the first. It is gener
ally conceded by every one that a member of
the State legislature increases in value to his
constituents ty each additional term he serves.
Some few months ago my name was being
talked by friends &e a candidate for the As
t;emb!y. A number of them came to me and
urged that I enter the contest, at that time
there being no other aspirant for the position.
I informed them that I would censider the
matter, but at no time did I agree to become
an active candidate. - Â» â¢
Mr. Ells comes from Stege, which is
the first town over the Alameda Coun
ty line, and therefore is the very last
town in the extreme southwestern part
of the county. He defeated William F.
Beldlng of San Pablo, the Democratic
nominee, two years ago by a majority
of 67S votes. Mr. Milnes is the editor
and proprietor of the Contra Costa
Gazette, published at Martinez, the
county seat, and one of the influential
Interior papers of the State. He also
owns the Point Richmond Leader, a
morning daily in the thriving terminus
town. He has always been a stanch
Republican, and has done much to keep
Contra Costa County in the Republi
can line when it threatened to break
away over Union Laborism.
And bo it happened that many Re
publicans thought that Mr. Milnes
should be rewarded with a nomination
for the Assembly. He never said that
he wanted to be a candidate, but while
he waited his friends worked up quite
a boom for him. Then Harry Ells
came out flatly and announced his can
didacy for a second term, and for a
while it looked as if there might be a
fight in the Republican party of that
section that would rend the organiza
tion. Mr. Milnes has settled the whole
thing with a statement as follows:
The political troubles that have
threatened to rend the Republican
party In Contra Costa County have all
been settled, and peace and harmony
reign. It all grew out of a possible
rivalry for the Republican nomination
for the Assembly between Harry Ells.
the present Assemblyman from that
county, and G. E. Milnes. Mr. Milnes
has come out in a signed statement in
his own papers and announces, in a
straightforward way, that he will not
be a candidate for the place, but will
support Mr. Ells.
Contra Costa County has the
Twenty-second Assembly District all
to Itself. It does not have to share the
Assembly District with any other coun
ty as it does the Senatorial District,
end consequently the contests for the
various party nominations are more
often tinctured with local affairs than
with affairs from the outside. So it
was In this case.

all of them are sold, although several have not
yet been entirely finished. I . built six of the
homes and disposed of them to persons outslda
of Alameda. I could sell or rent two dozen
more such cottages if I had them. There is a
demand now for a five-room . hous/* that will
rent for from $13 to |2O a month. Modern

ALAMEDA, June 11.â Realty dealers
here all express themselves as being
well satisfied with the prevailing con
ditions and unite in the statement that
not for twelve years has Alameda
property been appreciated as it now
is. Here is what some of the dealers
say concerning the local realty field:
The people of Oakland see in this ho
tel project something that will not only
attract visitors to the city, but will
keep them here when they arrive. Thia
is the big argument advanced by real
estate men. One and all say that it
would mean the opening of a larger
market for Oakland real estate if theie
was a place to which wealthy visitors
could be brought and kept.
All of the cities and settlements upon
the eastern bay shore are enjoying the
same degree of prosperity as Oakland,
despite the regular summer exodus to
mountains and seashore.
The plan was given new life and im
portance during the last week by the
voluntary subscription of $10,000 by
Julius Abrahamson of the firm of
Abrahamson Bros., dry goods mer
chants. This subscription was sent by
Mr. Abrahamson without solicitation.
It is believed that as soon as the com
mittee begins its work of soliciting
there will be no trouble In completing
the $750,000 reauired.
The proposition that is now attract
ing'the greatest attention and creating
the most interest in Oakland: is the
suggested new hotel. The committee
of citizens that was appointed to col
lect the funds for the new structure
has hardly got Its plans in operation,
and it is confronted with the summer
season when many people are away
and business is generally dull, so that
no organized work has been done. The
committee feels that it has about $250,
000 in sight* though not actually sub
scribed.

CUXARD LIXE ANNOUNCES
A REDUCTION IN KATES
mored cruisers of the Pennsylvania
class are to have two submerged tubes
and the battleships four, of which two
are above ! water. The aggregate esti
mated cost of the seven battleships is
$46,000,000, in round numbers, and that
of the eight armored cruisers $45,500,
000, which, with the $3,000,000 for the in
stallation- of torpedo tubes., brings- the
total estimated Â¦ cost of these fifteen
ships to over $34,500,000.
A CRUISER THAT FAILED.
The Navy Department has refused a
third trial of the cruiser Denver. Â¦ and
accepted; the .vessel subject to a reduc
tion in, price because of. its, failure to
make the required speed. The first trial
gave 16.5 knots, the second 16.75 knots,
which was j one-quarter â¢ knot short of
the, contract, and this . shortage will
cost the builders $25,000, besides, the ex
penses of two trial trips, otherwise paid
by the. Government when the. vessel
makes the required speed. When the
contracts for the six ships of the Den
ver class were awarded, in, December,
1899, five of the , builders accepted the
department's figures of 16.5 knots'
speed, but the builders of . the Denver
took the risk of : guaranteeing. 17 knots
at an advance in .price of $15,000 over
that of the next highest â¢ bid. The
Navy League, but has during the past
two years ceased the publication of the
"general information series from
abroad," the only concise and reliable
information on foreign navies that was
accessible to the public and which had
been published annually since 1SS3 by
the Navy Department.
The Board of Construction, composed
of the bureau chiefs in the Navy De
partment, has at last come to the wise
conclusion of putting submerged and
above water torpedo tubes in all the
battleships and armored cruisers under
construction. The five battleships and
six armored cruisers designed in 1900-1
were originally planned to- have two
submerged tubes, but subsequent
changes eliminated this armament and
contracts were awarded for- the con
struction of the ships in 1901. The cost
of installing torpedo tubes __ in these
eleven ships and four others since de
signed is estimated at close on to $3,
000,000, one-half of which amount would
have been saved If the original plans
had been. adhered to. As It is now, it
will become necessary to make many
alterations in the work already done,
for which contractors must Â¦ be paid,
and. in addition, a rearrangement -of
storerooms and . quarters will involve
considerable time and expense. Ar-
According to a recent report of the
German Navy League, there are eight
countries in which navy leagues have
been organized since 1S94. That of
Germany, although it was started In
189S â four years after the British
Leagueâ numbers 633.000 members and
has a cash balance in its treasury of
750,000 marks, or 51ST.200. The British
League has 20,000 members, while
France musters only 3900 and Italy
10.000. Spain organized a league in 1900
and claims 12.741 members. Even in
Belgium S00 people are navy leaguers,
although that country has no recog
nized navy. The popularity of the Ger
man Na\ r y League is entirely due to
the Emperor's untiring efforts to place
Germany second in the rank of naval
powers, and the Government Is fanning
the "patriotic flre started and has
aroused the interest of seaboards and
inland people in the subject. In the
United Stales contrary conditions ex
ist, for not alone does the Government
entirely ignore the existence of the
fined itself mainly to a recital of naval
history and description of vessels un
der construction. Unlike the British
Navy League Journal It is extremely
conservative and has offered no criti
cism on existing conditions.

Paymaster General Harris of the
United States Navy has obtained au
thority from Secretary Moody for a
Dew system of inspection of naval
supplies. It has been the complaint
of contractors for the past forty years
that there was an unnecessary quanti
ty of "red tape" and a great loss of
time in the inspection, acceptance and
payments of articles delivered at navy
yards, and many large firms have,
for these reasons, declined to make
bids for supplies. The new regulations
provide that inspections shall begin at
least by 10:20 a. m. on the second day
following the delivery of supplies and
be completed as rapidly as is consist
ent with the proper examination. All
causes of delav must be made the sub
ject of daily memoranda from the in
spection boards. The paymaster gen
eral proposes to establish the method

as nearly an possible resembling com
mercial practices.
The month of Ayril was prolific in
launching of war vessels, no less than
eeven ships taking to the water. The
United Slates led with the battleship
Virginia asd the armored cruisers
Colorado and California. On April 30
the French battleship Democratic the
British armored cruiser Devonshire aud
the German cruiser Munchen were
launched and a turbine torpedo-boat
v. as floated at Schiechau on April 2t.
An armored cruiser of 13,347 tons is to
be built at Brtst. She will be the long
est war vessel built for any navy, be
ing 515 feet, exceeding the British type
of Drake by 10 feet and that of the
California class in the United Slates
navy by 13 feet. The new French ar
mored cruiser is to huve triple screws
of 26,000 horsepower, giving a speed
of 22 knots, a bunker capacity of 2300
tcr.s and an armament of four 7.6-inch.
twelve B.4-inch. twenty-two 3-pounders,
two 2-pounders ar.d five torpedo tubes,
two of which are under water. The

A British ship of war recently ar

Rica two hours to answer the salute.
The ordnance consisted of one old mui
zlt -loader, which had to t>e allowed to
cool after each discharge, but the gun
r.Â«-rs. persisted and the salute was got
through ia the course of the day.
A new coast defense 10Vj-inch gun
was recently tried at Cherbourg, with
startling results. The concussion of the
discharge nearly shook the fort to
pieces. Dummies had been substituted
for live gunners, without which precau

NEW INSPECTION* SYSTEM.
Seine novel tests of the submarine
and destroyer flotilla* of tbÂ« Ports
mouth division took place last -month
near the Is'.e of "Wight. The object was
to ascertain the roost- advantageous
methods to be adopted by the subma
rines in repelling a eudden attack on
Pcrtsrr.outh harbor by a fleet of de
stroyers, and the first operations were
to discover the prospects of the subma
rines escaping from the fire of the de
efrcyerp' guns. Two substantial can
vass targets, representing in shape and
e:z<? submarine craft, shotting only the
conning tower and periscope above
Tvater. were towed by a torpedo-boat
at a speed of nine knots past the de
stroyers, which openÂ«-d fire with twelve
pounder Qulcli-flrers. Blfflcult as was
the target, some good practice was
made, and the canvas screen was pene
trated half a dozen times. In a fight
with destroyers, especially at daylight,
the submarines are at a decided dis
advantage, inasmuch as they have to
ccrae to the surface to make attacks
on the destroyers, while In operations
against heavier vessels, drawing from
twenty to twenty-eight feet of water,
no part of the submarine is exposed
above water when In the act of launch-
Ing her torpedo against the bottom of
the enemy's chips.
The entire fleet of fifteen Improved
torpedo-boats ordered in 1903 has been
delivered by the contractors and ac
cepted by the British Admiralty. They
ere all 225 feet in length, 23*Â» feet beam
and 10 feet draught, but their displace
ment varies from Â£50 tons to 534 tons.
Yarrow built four, Laird three. Palmer
five, Thornycroft two and Hawthorne
one of these boats, the guaranteed
epeeti of 2S knots being exceeded in all
from one to one-half a knot. They are
more substantially built than the type
of destroyers which they displace, and
the fictitious speed of 20 knots has been
reduced to 25 knots, with a better guar
antee sg-a'.r.st breakdowns. Fourteen
boats of this type are on the naval pro
gramme for 1504-05.
On May 15 there were eighty-three
British war vessels assembled at Pal
ma. Majorca, preparatory for maneu
vers. This fleet was composed of all
classes, from battle5hir>s of 15,000 tons
to destroyers of S00 tons, and carried
a total of over 33,000 officers and men.

Berlin's Marine Bride.
"The Marine Bride." one of the best
known characters in the streets of
Ltrlin, is dead. She was usually to be
Teen on Unter den Linden, between
Friedrichstrasse and the Brandenbur
gar Thor. She was a worn looking
woman, about fifty-five, shabbily
dressed, although of good family, and
always carried a heavy bag. Every
Berliner knew her, and no one molest
ed the poor, demented creature. Her
story Is tragic. Many years age she
was betrothed to a navy surgeon, and
shortly after her engagement she re
ceived news that he was drowned at
sea. Her mind became unhinged, and
since the day of the fatal news she has
tvandered along Unter den Linden, be
lieving that her betrothed would return
to Berlin, driving through the Bran
denburgcr Thor. In the heavy bag she
carried what she belived was a sult'of
clothes, for which her lover would ex
change his eea-stained garments. â

Origin of the Whitecaps.
The term "whitecaps" has come to
be synonymous with bands of men
united by secret ties for the purpose of
committing unlawful acts or for the
purpose cf taking the law into their
own hands and administering Justice to
offenders against public morals who
cannot be reached in the regular way.
But New England's earliest "white
caps" and thÂ«? first bearers of the name
*vcre organized for a different purpose.
Their oridn dated back to the days of
Rainsford R^srer?. an impostor and
vagabond, v Iioso villainies outdid all
the efforts of Henry Tufts.

"Rlncon" is Spanish for "Inside cor

now stands the Sailors' Home, once
the United States Marine Hospital,
was in the early days of San Francisco
called "Punta del rincon." or point of
the inside corner. The hill, which at
one time was the fashionable resi

rived Its name from the "punta del

HOLIDAYâ Subscriber, Oakland. CaL
This department has on several occa
sions announced that in the United
States there is no national holiday, not
even the Fourth of July, as Congress
has never declared a national holiday
for the Union. â¢-â¢-/
AS the chairman of the Democratic Congress com
mittee is named Cowherd, it is fair to assume that
one of his ancestors was quite successful as a
herder. The distinguished gentleman from Missouri,
however, is having a much harder time as a herder than
ever his ancestor had. Evidently it is much more diffi
cult to herd political asses than to herd cows, for in his
efforts to herd his party into some kind of orderly group
ing and making them keep to the road the Missourian
is having no success at all.
A recent report from Washington announces that Mr.
Cowherd has opened the campaign headquarters of his
committee, but is in great perplexity as to what to do
next. â¢ According to the report Mr. Cowherd says ;the
committee is* receiving a great number of applications
for speeches on this and that subject of current political
interest, but especially on the tariff. He thinks this is
going to be another campaign of education like that of
1896^ but is not sure whether free silver will be a plank
in the platform, whether advanced tariff doctrines will
be expounded by the party's declaration of principles, or
what attitude will be taken in regard to the trusts and
other matters.
Under the circumstances the perplexed campaign man
ager does not know what kind of literature to send out.
At present he is going slow. Perhaps in the end he may
decide to abandon politics and take to herding cows.
Such a course would not only enable him to be true
to the traditions of nis name, but would lead him into
paths both plcasanter and more profitable.

A Prince of Sivindlers.
It is noteworthy that for several
years past the police in various Euro
pean capitals have been seeking a
man who has swindled various people
out of thousands of pounds on the pre
text that he was possessed of the plans
of German fortresses, for which the
French Government were prepared to
pay him huge sums of money.
This mysterious individual was de
scribed as the "Prince of Swindlers."
He has lived in the most expensive
hotels upon the money obtained from
his victims and his society was much
sought after owing to. his -charming
manners.
"Morgan," "Ferguson" and "Baron
von Schelia" are a few of the names
under which he is alleged to have
made the acquaintance of many peo
ple in fashionable hotels and to have
swindled them out of sums of money
varying in amount from a few hun
dred pounds to thousands.
His system of obtaining money was
ingenious' and bold, but it varied in
details according to circumstances. It
was, in fact, a tfrilliant elaboration of
the confidence trick. Posing under one
of his aliases, he would confide In per
sons who believed in him that he was
in communication with a German of
ficer, who was prepared to sell him
the plans of the fortifications of Metz
or Strasburg, or both. Also that for
these documents a Marquis, acting for
the French*!Minister of War, was pre
pared to pay a very large sum of
money â sometimes as much as Â£320,

scretly meet the "Marquis." who
would offer large sums for the plans,
but not so much as the "Baron" de
sired and negotiations would hang fire.
In the meantime the mythical Ger
man officer would insist on drawing
some money, which the victim was
induced to hand over to the "Baron."
This would go 9Â«- until the credulity
or the funds of the "gob'tween" were
exhausted, and then the "Baron"
would fade Into space and the French
"Marquis" would disappear as myste
riously as he had appeared.
Five years ago the English police
held a warrant for the arrest of a
man believed to be the swindler in

of fraud upon an Austrian. Nearly
three years ago an English gentleman
complained of having been robbed in
a precisely similar fashion by. "Baron

to discover this man. Hotels were

Japanese Army Rations.
General Weston, chief of subsistence
of -the American army, has solved
what he believes to be the great secret
of the wonderful mobility of the Jap
anese army. It lies in the field ration,
a sample of which he has received
from Major W. B. Barker at Naga
saki, one of the American officers who
are watching the war. The ration
shows that the Japanese soldier can
live and fight for a month on a food
supply that weighs less than the dally
ration of the American soldier in the
field.
tion in weight
The fish received by General Weston
is about seven inches long and an inch
and a half thick in the middle, and is
dried until it resembles petrified wood.
It weighs only twelve ounces, but Ma
jor Parker says it will sustain a Jap
anese soldier for 6even days.
When soldiers are on the march
they eat the fish Just as it Is, biting off
small pieces, which are thoroughly
masticated, but when they are in camp
the fish is shaved off in small slices
and cooked with rice. The fish re
sembles a mackerel, but its Japanese
name Is "mamibushi."
The fish is about two feet long and
thick and solid before preparation for
the army ration. In preparing it for
army use it is cut in two and steamed
and dried alternately until it Is re
duced to about one-eighth of its orig
inal size, with a corresponding reduc-
Each Japanese soldier can carry
enough fish and rice to last him three
or four weeks and a whole army can
be made absolutely Independent of the
commissary trains that are indispen
sable in other armies. If the Russian
soldiers could live on as little as the
Japanese require the Siberian Rail
road would have little to do but haul
troops, for one trainload of dried fish
and rice would sustain General Kuro
patkin's army for weeks.
Dried ftsh^ is used only as a field
ration. The regular daily ration in
the Japanese army consists of one and
a half pounds of rice and half a pound
of canned meats. The daily ration in
the United States army weighs about
four pounds and the emergency ra
tion is not a great deal lighter.

generally granted only to distinguished
men either in the diplomatic or consular
services, the recent reception of Jacob

much discussion in society circles. Mr.

had but little to say regarding his
audience with his Majesty, but I learn
privately that it was secured through
the Influence of Sir Ernest Cassel, the
Jewish Baronet, who is on terms of
personal intimacy with the King, and
that the whole affair was arranged at
the last Newmarket race meeting,
vhcre Mr. Schiff came into personal
contact with King Edward for the i.rst
time. Mr. Schiff Is also said to have
contributed a good round sum to char

here is interested. The alien emigra

anxiety and they are doing all they
can to save their coreligionists from
repatriation. Mr. Schiff went alone

bt-en for lhÂ« St'.st two years the source

concession gave but scant satisfaction
to the innocent sportsmen and this
jear the Thames conservancy has been

vaited upon the lord of Cliveden a few
days ago only to find out that he had
decided to close the riverâ stream and
bankâ against all but his personal
friends-:. As the law stands he is per
fectly within his right in doing so, but
the Thames conservancy, in spite of the
fact that it is an absolutely fossilized
and conservative body, can get its
back up at times, and it is believed
that Mr. Aster has prodded it into do
ing so. If all other means fail to move
Mr. Actor the conservancy will apply
to Parliament to make new laws for
the government of the river Thames.
It 4s somewhat significant that

precautions were not taken without
need, for "Ferguson" did succeed in
escaping in a cab. and was not cap
tured until he had reached the Sercot
railroad stationâ four miles away. He
was about to go away by train when
the police motor car dashed up to the
station. He had 23,000 francs In his
possession, but the "Marquis." who
was to pay Â£320.000 for the bogus plans
in Mr. Harris" possession, had no more
than 17 francs in his pocket. On learn
ing of the arrest Mr. Harris crossed
to Paris to join Mr. Birkbeck In assist
ing the police in bringing "Ferguson"
to justice.
Between two and three years ago
"Baron von Schelia" ruined a London
doctor by Inducing him to part with
Â£1500â the whole of his fortune. Sche
lia, who then lived at a private hotel In
Bayswater, where the doctor with his
wife also resided, produced to him the
"secret plans" of Metz, Strasbarg and
Breslau, and the drawings of a new
German gun.
These, of course, were fictitious, but
he persuaded the doctor that he was to
receive 2,000,000 francs for them from
the French Government, and promised
him Â£6000 as his share.
Another gentleman living in the same
hotel was also victimized. The doctor
was taken to Holland and introduced
to "Count de Beville." who agreed on
behalf of the French Government to
pay 2.000.000 francs for the plans.
A final meeting was arranged to take
place at the , Lord Warden Hotel.

with all his money, waited in vain for

THE latest war news of significance is to the effect
that, with tire imminent fall of Port Arthur to spur
them to feverish activity, Russian military coun
cils have directed their attention to the defense oi iheir
own capital. News dispatches from St. Petersburg state
that the fortifications 'guarding the waterway to the
Czar's imperial city on the Gulf of Riga and at the en
trance of the Gulf of Finland are being' strengthened by
the addition of some new and high power guns, that the
approaches to Cronstadt are being mined and that the
fortress of that name has been made the center for a
chain of water batteries stretching along either shore of
the Gulf of Finland. St. Petersburg is being made im
â¢pregnable.
This news carries with it a weight of vital significance
disproportionate to the mere record of the , armament
of the protecting fortresses. Nobody believes that the
capital of Russia is in immediate danger of being be
leaguered, nor, indeed, that a direct attack upon it by
Japanese forces is even a probability. A Japanese fleet
in European waters would be met with as great a storm
of protest from non-combating powers as our own fly
ing squadron in the Spanish war had it carried into
execution the threat of a direct attack upon Spanish sea
ports. The meat in this situation for the diplomats and
strategists to digest is this: that Russia has awakened
to the fact that she is being whipped unmercifully in this
struggle with little Japan, and the fear that comes to the
wounded has made her show her teeth tq the rest of
the European pack which stands in eager anticipation
about her borders. .
These few months of fighting in the Far East has
brought a great surprise to the world, a greater surprise
to Russia. Even those who gave of their sympathies to
the brown men from. the first dared hope only for an
even break in the shares of victory between the two
antagonists; others who were bound by fear or favor
to the giant of the north could see in the hostilities
ahead nothing but a series of heavy skirmishes in which
Russian force would annihilate the upstarts from the
Mikado's land. Followed disaster after, disaster to the
Russian navy, the occupation of Korea without a strug
gle, the landing of Japanese troops upon the shores of
Manchuria. Still the pro-Russians urged that the world
should just wait until the Russian soldier got into action.
He has done so. has been terribly beaten on the Yalu
and on the Liaotung peninsula, and the Russian strong
hold in the East is about to fall from his hands.
All this has struck home to the Czar and his people.
All vaunted might and terrible strength conjured up by
fear about the grim shadow of the great Slav empire is
being shredded away by the bayonet strokes of the Jap
anese. Russia turns her eyes to her ally, France; France
leans nearer to the Dover cliffs than to the Neva's
banks. To Germany Russia looks; Kaiser Wilhelm,
never raises his eyes from his knitting now. A great fear
strikes home to the Russian heart. The road to St.
Petersburg, like the road to Moscow nearly a hundred
years ago. is hedged withfdefenses.
GUARDING ST. PETERSBURG.
by the pretense that through the agen
cy of spirits he could secure for them -a.
concealed treasure, -inen he disap
peared.
He was soor. depleting the pockets of
the people in several of the Southern
States by similar means. Under the
name of William Rice, with two con
federates, he reaped a rich harvest by
operating various schemes in Adams
County, Pennsylvania, making oft with
a considerable cum yielded by his con
fiding dupes.
It was soon after this, about 1800,
that he went to Exeter, bearing his true
name of Rainsford Rogers, which had
not acquired so bad an odor in Eastern
Xew England as in some other quar
ters.
In a short time he formed the ac
quaintance of a number of men of sub
stance in the town, who were found
sufficiently credulous to put entire faith
In him. To a dozen or more he con
fided his belief that a subterranean
treasure of great value existed in the
neighborhood which by his skill he
eoukl discover and appropriate to their
common benefit.
He repeatedly conducted them on
dark nights to out of the way places to
dig in the swamps with spades and
other implements, and frequently kept
them at work for hours delving for the
hidden prize. On these, expeditions he
insisted that all must wear white caps,
a circumstance that afterward gave
the name to the company.
On one of these night excursions there
appeared before the eyes of the awe-
Ftricken diggers a figure all in white,
representing a spirit, which uttered
tome words that none could under
stand. One "whitecap." anxious to
lope nothing, said: "A little louder, Mr.
Ghopt; I'm rather hard of hearing."
But the diligent diggers found no
treasure, and goon Rogers disclosed the
reason for 1 their want of success. The
golden deposit was there, beyond a
doubt, but they needed one thing more
to enable them to find it. That was a
particular kind of divining rod. It
must be made of costly materials, but
it would be infallible. It could not be
obtained this side of Philadelphia, and
would cost several hundred dollars.
So in/atuated were the deluded com
pany that they quickly raised the nec
essary amount and delivered it to Rog
ers, who mounted his horse, and, with
a saddle and bridle borrowed from one
of his dupes, rode oft to parts unknown,
never to return.
The "whitecaps" had been watched,
in their clandestine me'etlngs, however,
and soon they were the laughing stock
of the town, and the deaf man who
asked the ghost to "speak a little loud

Suing a Prince.
Prince Frederick Leopold of Prussia
has Just had a Judgment issued against
him by the Berlin courts In a suit
brought against him by his former
chief of the household, Baron von
Luck, and has been condemned to pay
the latter a pension of $3000 a year for
the remainder of his life. This is the
first occasion, I believe, of a Prince of
the reigning House of Prussia being
brought 'into court, and of having a
judgment rendered against him, and
the affair has attracted a good deal of
attention on the continent of Europe
just on that account. It would not
have been possible under the old laws,
but has been rendered so by the terms
of the new code, which is destined to
prove one of the principal memorials
of the present Emperor's reign. It is a
pity, however, that the case was ever
allowed to come Into court, for the
Prince is colossally rich and the sum
at stake was a relatively small one. ,
Moreover, Baron Luck had been for
many years an old and devoted servant
of the Prince and claimed, when forced
to sever his relations with the Prince,
a pension based on the whole time that
he had spent in the Prince's service,
whereas Frederick Leopold was only
inclined to rate his pension upon the
relatively brief period that he had
acted as grand master of his house
hold. Emperor "William declined to in
terfere, it being, however, generally
understood that he sympathized with
the Baron, and thus It is that the
courts have been called upon to deter
mine the issue, settling it, as I have
stated above, against the Prince and in
favor of the Baron.â La Marquise de
Fontenoy.
BUSINESS conditions showed some : change last
week. While quotations as a rule exhibited little
ilucÂ»iation, the feeling throughout the country
appeared firmer on the whole, with more optimism and
ineliraticn to do business. In these respects the aspect
of trade was better than for some weeks.
In iiÂ«j part ot the country was this improved feeling
more manifest than in Wall street. While trading con-
Uf.ued light, there was no selling pressure nor even any
pronounced tendency to liquidate, and, in fact, the pro
fessionals were not inclined to sell anything bearing a
standard brand. A better demand for good bonds was
apparent, and as a demand for bonds is almost invariably
followed by a better demand for the higher class of
dividend-paying stocks, the street became more buoyant.
Some well posted operators even went so far as to ex
press the opinion that a moderate rally in the market
might be expected after the two political conventions
were out of the way, though the wish might have been
father to the thought.
The fact is, everybody seems to want a rise in stocks.
There are few bears, while the bulls are numerous. But
nothing can be done in the way of a bull campaign with
out the active participation of the public, which still
hold aloof and cannot be induced to .buy on a large
scale. They watch the quotations day after day and are
apparently deeply interested, but they take it out in
watching, as the fox watched the grapes. Astute ob
servers in close touch with the stock market said a year
ago that the public had sunk more money in Wall street
tha/i anybody was aware of and that it would be several
years ere their pockets would be replenished to the
speculative capacity, and it looks as if their predictions
wore coming out true. At any rate, while good stocks are
unquestionably low and money is wonderfully plentiful
and cheap and readily accessible to solvent .borrowers,
and the leading financiers are employing all their blan
dishments to induce the investing class to take hold of
the market, they are turning a deaf ear to the siren song
and staying out of the arena.
The leading factor at present is the condition of the
crops. In fact, it is freely said that they will dominate
all trade conditions this year, as the effect of the "Presi
dential year" has been largely discounted. Prospects
for a bounteous yield of everything are excellent, and it
is probably this condition which imparts increased con
fidence to the commercial situation. Wheat, cotton and
corn bid fair to be very large crops, and the minor prod
ucts of the farm are not behind them, though thÂ£ season
is several weeks backward.
Gold exports have apparently ceased for tire time
being, at least, and as receipts of Japanese gold at San
Francisco are again offsetting the shipments of gold
from New York to Europe, and, indeed, exceeding them
at the moment, no more talk of the unfavorable effects
of a gold efflux is heard. The New York banks say that
with the regular production of the country, the receipts
from Japan and the Klondike, reinforced later on by
cotton and grain bills on Europe, combined with the
stock' now on hand, which in itself is abundant, there
need be no apprehension concerning gold exports from
now on.
Another favorable showing which is attracting con
siderable attention is the increase in exports of manu
factures from the United States, our shipments of manu
factured iron alone during the past ten months amount
ing to $89,000,000, or almost $10,000,000 more' than during
the corresponding' period last year. And this in spite of
the great falling off in the domestic demand for iron and
steel, which has done so much to depress stocks and
general trade and make the country bilious. It is quite
possible that if the vast steel combine had been managed
by conservative business men instead of a set of madcaps
and reckless plungers, who apparently labored under the
delusion that gold double eagles grew on bush.es like
blackberries and that, the crop was inexhaustible, the
current recession in trade might have been much less
marked and perhaps avoided altogether. Ten years from
now, when perspective gives us a broader and more com
prehensive view of this era, it will probably be found
that the iron and steel trust was the great rank weed,
the upas tree, that grew up in the financial and com
mercial garden and blighted all the cultivated plants in
the plat.
For the rest, business is quiet and devoid of especial
feature. R. G. Dun &. Co. report that the cost of living
has continued to decrease without interruption since
March 1. Stocks of food products and manufactured
goods have largely increased and are 'still increasing.
The markets of the West are full of provisions, and it
has been found, after many years' observation, that com
mercial inactivity is almost always preceded by a heavily
supplied and declining provision market, and vice versa.
The demand for cash wheat at Chicago and other West
ern points is extremely slow. The Minneapolis flour mills
found it necessary to close down several days last week
owing to the poor demand for flour. The textile mills
of Pennsylvania and New Jersey have lately been obliged
to do the same, and tor the same reason. The New
England footwear factories alone reported a fair demand
for their product. No further reductions in the staffs of
the great railways were reported, but all the railroads
arc retrenching, and their earnings continue to show a
small -decrease, say 2 or 3 per cent/ from the preceding
year.
i A significant commercial sign is the readiness with
which employers of labor find men to fill the places of
strikers. This has not been the case until quite recently,
and it goes" to show the, decreased activity in general
business. As such it is a most significant barometer to
current conditions. "I'
Turning from the country at large to the Pacific Coast,
we find conditions fully as cheerful as they have been at
Â«ny time. There is the same steady influx of home
seekers, the same cutting up of large land holdings to
accommodate these immigrants, the same plethora of
money, the same fine crop prospects, the same large
export and interior trade, the. same broad and sanguine
commercial smile. True, business is. quieter than last
year at this time, but then thisis the case all over the
United States, and we cannot expect to completely ig
nore nor to be immune from influences- that govern the
rest of the country. Besides, this is summer, when trade
is always more or less quiet.
The bank clearings of the country last week were 14.J
per cent below those for the corresponding, week last
year, but the clearings, themselves were larger than for
the preceding week by $200,000,000, being in round num

DAXCIXG IS A FEATDKE
Irish Festival
Hundreds of Pleasure
Seekers to El Caiupo
The sixth biennial having passed into
history, the qulnquinnlal convention in
Berlin now holds the stage of feminine
activities. From all accounts a merry
stssion must be In progress, for the
primal fight of suffrage was waged
furiously In preliminary committee
meetings before the formal convening
oT the convention. Now, we all know
what a merry chatter the clubwomen
can make in one tongue â what must it
be in a half-dozen? What a headache
for the gallery!
AVhile there are delegates present
from nearly all the civilized countries
where women have ceased "to be put
upon," as Mrs. Claudle used to say,
the recognized languages for public ex
pression at the convention are German
and English. Now, even in our own
land, the rock upon which clubwomen
split is the reef of suffrage. And while
It is true that in all clubs, civic, social
or cultural, women are found who
stanchly support the brave leaders in the
cause of equal rights, yet their convic
tions are not publicly discussed in the
club â lest indeed it be a suffrage club,
and of- these there are many in San
Francisco, due in a great measure to
the indomitable energy of Mrs. Eliz
abeth Sargent, Mrs. A. Sperry and Mrs.
John F. Swift. S/> It Is not to be won
dered at that the women of Germany,
who have for centuries been house
bound, should be panic-stricken when
confronted with the suffrage proposi
tion. What would their husbands say?
Yes, and their sons? Why, In the face
of the Emperor's promulgation of
women's limitations, mlgnt these fool
hardy women not be yanked up for lese
majesty? And so the merry war was
on, the suffragists led by Miss Anita
Ausberg, and the conservatives by Miss
Helen Lange. Uupretty things were
said to each other In thoroughly human
style, until dear, saintly Susan B. An
thony arrived on the scene, and a truce
vas declared â for who could quarrel in
the presence of this woman In whom
forty years of struggles have wrought
a divine composure and a dominant
power for peace?
Doubtless this stirring discussion of
the relative rights of women will be the
The Century Club will doubtless be
housed under its own rooftree by the
coming of winter. The old house on
the corner of Franklin and Bush
streets, which the club recently pur
chased for J30.GOO. will be remodeled
The report falls to relate what Misa
Anthony said in reply, but It is a safe
assumption that the Inn keeper retreat
ed under heavy fire â that Is. if all the
victims of his cupidity were on the
firing line.
And. by the way. could anything be
mcrre distinctly funny than the telegra
phic story Involving Miss Susan B.
Anthony. Mrs. May Wright Sewall
(presiding officer of the International
Conventic-n). Mrs. Carrie Chapman
Catt, Mrs. Oilman. Dr. Anna Shaw)and
Mrs. John F. Swift In Â«m imbrdglio
with a wretch of a hotel-keeperâ he of
the Palast Hotelâ who presented to
each a convivial bill for beer, cham
pagne and other agencies of hilarity?
Now, if you know the personality of
these women, you can grasp the Joke.
In fact. Miss Anthony Is, as the whole
world knows, an indefatigable W. C. T.
U. woman, lut the boniface bravery
broke the news to her that she cad

her apartments, and he would )ike the
cash equivalent for the same.
Apropos of discussions outside of
suffrage, topics relating to educational

subjects, and the arts and sciences will

Identified with the subjects at hand.
And, by the way. San Francisco has
sent an able delegate â Mrs. John F.
Swift, national president of the Coun
cil of Women, who may be relied upon
to say a few things in a manner that
will attract attention In that gathering
of 4000.
It Is said that even the Empress Is
an avowed enemy of the movement â
but perhaps the Empress, like a good
many of us timid women, agrees with
her lord for peace â sweet peace.
beginning of a stubborn campaign In
the German empire for suffrage, in
which the women will be reinforced
by the Socialist partyâ assuredly not by
the statesmen who look for royal
favors. O.U.
However, eoming on the heels of
this sanitary campaign, comes rather
a discouraging report from Ashburne,
Virginia, where Senator Stewart ot
Nevada has established a 600-acre
model dairy. Here cleanliness and
sanitary methods prevailed, but the
Senator failed to obtain a better price
for his product than the ordinary
dairyman, whose cows never got a
bath, and the statesman sold out. los
ing something like $100,000 in ths
deal. In discussing the affair the ven
erable apostle of free silver was heard
to remark that the public seemed "to
care Httle for a trifling detail like*
cleanliness" â those knowing the # Sen
ator being at liberty to supply the ad
jective.
And thus does it come to pass that
a famous statesman may make a poor
dairyman. V i s>
However, success to the Home Club!
Perhaps Oakland is keener to sanita
tion than the easy-going F. F. V.
At a recent meeting of the Adelphian
Club Mrs. Moore made a strong ap
peal to the club members and frlendu
in behalf of a sanitary dairy that Is
now in a nebulous state. If a suffi
cient number of subscribers for its
product be obtained, and the home
club is busily circulating subscription
blanks for that purpose, the project
will materialize at once.
At present student* are belcjr trained In thÂ«
method* cf sanitary dairying In thÂ« agricult
ural department of the university at Berke
ley. The mlli supplied by this model dairy
is mostly U3*d in farr.t'.les having sick or
delicate children, and Professor Jaffa report*
very satufaotcry results.
Tour committee believes that capital will bÂ«
easily available, provided there caa t>Â» as
surance of customers willing to ray the ad
vanced price necessary to furnish sanitary
milk.
Several men. re'labU and of good -tan !:-*.
are ready to estab:!sh a dairy on strtetly saal
tary rrlnciplea if they can be assured of cus
tomers.
Apropos of the milk question, the
Home Club has appointed a committee
to consider the .possibilities of a sani
tary dairy. In a circular letter recently
Issued by the committee the following
statements are made:
Scientific men have carefully studWd t!Â»Â»
question of a healthful m'.'.k supply, and havÂ»
d-cl<led that the greatest source of. disÂ»asÂ«
through milk has come tram its tmprojer car*.
Other cities have felt thÂ» need of sanitary
dalxie* and have established them on a scien
tific basis.
Have vou heard of the new Home
Club in Oakland? Well, you will.
Though but two months old It is uiÂ»

That was a famously interesting
meeting of the Hillside Club held last
week In Berkeley, when an exhibition
of relics and heirlooms was given at
the Hillside schoolhouse. Now these In
teresting relics of the days agone were
contributed by seventy-five families,
and included tapestries, embroideries.
rare bits of china and pottery and somÂ«
unique records. The exhibition was in
finitely more fascinating than an or
d'nary loan exhibition, as the element
of personal interest was infused Into
this affair of the Hillside Club, the
owners lingr-ring near the priceless
thingrs to tell their story. And therein
lay their greatest value. The following
committee, assisted by Charles Keelei,
arranged the affair: Mrs. William J.
Monro. Mrs. C. M. Perkins. Mrs. Joha

Mrs. Almeric Coxhead and Mrs. Bricker.
What an indomitable combination
Is woman's energy and men's money!
A demonstration cf the result was
made manifest on the 4th. when the
San Rafael Women's Improvement
Club unfolded to the public Its "Pony
Show." These women set about to
help the crusade against the musi
cal insect that loves to buzz about San
Rafael In summertime, and they con
ceived the plan of giving a minature
Wild West show to help â just by way
of variety. How well it took, and how
bravely the men lined up under the
oaks to applaud and spend their dimes
and dollars is a matter of local history.

WITNESS THE WONDERFUL DEMON-
STRATIONS of the NOTED LIVINGSTONE.
Kor a reliable and Intelligent clairvoyant
reading go to LIVINGSTONE. 42S Eddy St.
He asks you no questions, but tells you
Â¦ what you wish to know.
He does not mention all the ills and mis-
fortunes you are heir to. You are acquainted
with the facts In your case. Let PROFESSOR
LIVINGSTONE analyze the matters that are
troubling you, find the cause of trouble and
suggest the remedy.
He Is as conspicuous for his wonderful oc-
cult analysis as he is for his original ex-
pression and vivid truthfulness.
Would It not be a relief to know how you
will succeed, to be relieved of the matters that
arc troubling you and of the schemes of your
enemies, that you may meet with better success?
A test reading Is not a life reading. When
you call on PROF. LIVINGSTONE he will
give you u full life reading for $1. A test
Is of little value; when the mind is troubled
you need more substantial aid and advice.

A clipping in the pocket tells of a
man named Fulton being sent to the
asylum for entering the San Francisco
Gan and Electric "Works and delivering
a sermon to the employes.
"Started with $195. Lost $100 flat.
Balance $95, wheih I blowed in on a
stemwinding drunk."
"Santa Anaâ Lost a.t play in this
town all the coin I had. Sold wheel to
get out of town."
"No more race programmes for your
Uncle Fulton. At Santa Barbara by
the Sea."
"In case of accident there is no one
to be notified. Bury me In the potter's
field or give my body to the doctors.
It is all the same to me."
The landlady in the Raleigh building
in this city says she believes Fulton
belonged to the Kansas Volunteers who
served in jthe Philippines. He was a
heavy drinker, but orderly, and never
made any trouble.
The following entries showed that hÂ»
had gambled heavily while In Califor
nia:
PORTLAND, June 12.â Tha body of a
man about 30 years of age was found
floating In "the "Willamette, near Oregon
City, to-day. It haa been identified as
that of Frank Fulton of Kansas City,
who was last seen about a week ago
sitting on the edge of a dock, his feet
dangling over the river. In the pock
ets of the dead man were found a num
ber of letters and memoranda. One,
addressed to the Coroner, reads:
Special Di-patch to The CalL
The Pacific Mail Steamship Com
pany's steamship Algoa, which struck
the rocks Just outside Point Bonita
last Tuesday and was rushed^,to the
Greenwich street dock, where 2500 tons
of freight was removed from her. hold,
was towed around yesterday to the
Pacific Mail dock. The balance of
her cargo, consisting of 7500 tons, Â¦will
be discharged there. She will later go
on- the dry dock .to ascertain the ex
tent of her damage. Pumps have been
going night and day since her arrival,
but the lightening t/f her cargo has
considerably stopped the rush of water
into the hold. .
In spite of his views of Americans
as published, Mori, it is learned, would
like to marry an "American goddess of
refinement and education" and to that
end has asked friendly aid of at least
one young woman in this city.
The Rev. F. J. de Friest, an American
missionary in Japan and a Yale grad
uate, translated Mori's communication
and sent it to this country. It includes
an insinuation against the moral char
acter of American women, which
aroused Mr. de Friest's resentment.
De Friest's translation of Mori's com
munication is in part as follows:
Many of those who are studying sociological
problems. Fuch as those of labor and poverty,
look as If they might become leaders In strikes.
Students of literature mainly appear as quiet
fellows, but when it comes to theologians their
beggar-like faces are in the majority.
It seems to me that failure of their work li
because of missionaries, and their satellites are
nothing but vulgar fellows. Ignorant and with
out brains. It is my conviction that not until
â¢we drive out missionaries and their satellite
evangelists will pure Christianity flourish.
NEW HAVEN, June 12.â Jitaro Mori,
a wealthy Japanese who has studied
social science at Yale for three yearB,
has made such caustic criticism of the
American missionaries to Japan, al
though himself a' Congregationalism
that the American Board of Foreign
Missions has taken notice of his views,
which were printed. recently in a. Jap
anese journal which he sent them.
Mori paid his critical respects also to
the theological students of the uni
versity, saying that among them "beg
gar-like faces are in the majority."

Herbert Long and Frank Mitchell
furnished a good exhibition against
Macdavin and Collier, playing a slash
ing, driving game, which disposed of
their veteran opponents. Long has
broken into fast company of late and
13 proving he Is not out of place. The
fcilowing are the scores of the games'
played at the California Club courts:
There was no tournament tennis
play on either the California or the
Golden Gate Club courts yesterday,
the match for the San Francisco cham
pionship having been again postponed.
This is the first Sunday in many weeks
that has passed without a tjurniment
match of some class on these courts.
MacGavin and Murdock will meet next
Sunday, if both are in condition, for
the championship of the city, after
which there will be no further matches
until the annual tournament for the
Slate championship, nexi month.
The attendance was unusually light
at the Golden Gate Ciub yesterday and
while larger at the California Club
only practice matches were played.
Some of these were of a high class, the
best being that in which Frank Mitch
ell and J. D. MacGavin met William B.
Collier Jr. and Dr. Samuel Hardy in
doubles. The latter have not played
for several weeks, but judging by their
work yesterday the rest has improved
their game. Both played fine, tennis,
winning two good sets from their high
class opponents, who have kept in prac
tice by continuous play for months
past. Both in the back court and at
the net their game was strong. Hardy
made effective use of his cross court
short chop stroke, following it by tak
ing the net. Their steady game was
effective against the dashing style of
play practiced by MacGavin and
Mitchell.

Dr. L. V. Frates of the Shell Mound
Pistol and Rifle Club has made the
best bullseye of the year with a shot
that measures only 7% thousands from
a true center.
The organizations represented at the
range were the San Francisco
Schuetzen Verein. Germania Schuetzen
Club. Golden Gate Rifle and Pistol
Club. Independent Rifles and the
Norddeutscher Shooting Company. The
scores: . Â«Â¦
In the Germania Club contest Frank
E. Mason was far ahead of Â«Â»" com
petitors with an excellent score of
227 rings in his medal string, winding
up his effort by making a dead-center
shot.
August Jungblut, the veteran rifle
man, was high man in the San Fran
cisco Schuetzen Verein with the goojd
score of 221 rlnea In his 10-shot medal
string. George H. Bahrs of the same
club gave him a close call with 217 to
his credit.
The shooting ranges at Shell Mound
Park were not as well patronized yes
terday as is usual for the second Sun
day of the month. The reason is found
in that so many of the best marksmen
are tn New York attending the Bundes
festival.

Taoonia Wins First Game Handilv.
but Loses Second.
A couple cf hard luck errors started
The going. After Yerkes had been re
tired Miller was hit by a pitched ball j
and came in on Hildebrand's two-bag- i
irer to left. Waidrcn singled to right, j
and Hilde made a bluff at running for
the plate. G&Bley threw the sphere in I
and it just barely bounded over Byrnes' J
head. This let Hildebrand score and j
sent Waidrcn to third.
Meany brought Waldron in with a j
bingJe, and apain the ball was thrown j
around, in the mixup Meany regis- j
tered. After that Irwin hit and Town- >
send hit. and they both arrived when I
Jimmy Byrnes made a low throw to I
second base trying to catch Townsend |
rapping-. J
That apparently ended the strife: but j
not Quite, for in the seventh Oakland j
was coming strongly. The first three j
men up. Ganley. Francks and SchlaSty. ]
Fir-pled, filling the bases. Dunleavy j
rapped one past Reitz and Ganley was j
there. Devereaux popped to Leahy,
making the first out. At this juncture !
Mr. Yerkes executed a wild pitch, let- I
ting Francks score. Moskiman lined a
hot one at Miller, which the Rabbit
fielded nicely. While Schlafley was be
ing run down between third and home
the ball got away from Leahy after the
put -out was made and Dunleavy j
eneaked in. making the score 7 to 6 in :
favor of San Francisco, the locals hav
irg registered in their half of the in
ring.
It looked like a good chance for Oak
land to wfn out at any cost, but more I
Vad work happened in the eighth, when j
Terkes hit and Miller was again slapped
la the ribs. Waldron scored Yerkes
""ith a Ion? fly ani HHdebrand walked.
Both Miller and Hildebrand came in on
iteany's pop By to second, which no one
v.Â«ent after. The score:

vas a slide on the baseball toboggan.
For a few innings the Commuters were
â¢ ir.r.ing on their home grounds, but
the curtain was alÂ»out to be rung

Again the Commuters were the big

inning, however, there came a change.
The score was then 3 to 1 in Oakland's
favor, but before Fan Francisco got
through working in the fifth they
jammed five in and made it 6 to 3 in
iheir favor.
Munroe looked fresh as a daisy after
taking his bath in the ocean. His bat
tered nose is healing rapidly, as no one
had a chance to take any punches at
it yesterday. The talk of postponing
the battle does not seem to worry the
big minpr in the least. He will be fit
and readv on the important night, and
.hat is all he seems concerned about at
the present time.
Manager James Coffroth of the Yo
semite Athletic Club states positively I
that the Jeffries-Munrce flgrht will be |
held en next Friday nignt. All kinds,
of rurr.ors are being wafted about the J
town, some to the effect that the fight
is off. others that it has been post
poned for two weeks and others that it
will never take place, but in the face
of all these Manager Coffroth appears
confident and so expresses himself.
From indications the champion's In
jured knee is progressing favorably.
He rested all day yesterday and the
member gave him no trouble. The
swelling seems to have gone down
somewhat, and it seems the injury
should heal rapidly.
The big fellow insisted on having it
lanced yesterday, but the attending
physician refused to perform the oper
ation, stating that it was not neces
sary, as the wound would heal much
more rapidly of its own accord by ab
sorption. Jeff, while a little impatient,
is not vi3iblv worried over it and thinks
he will be ready for the fray Friday
night.
â¢ I have no fears." said Manager Cof
froth last night. ''The fight will take
place on Friday night and the big
champion will be in better condition
than ever before when he enters the
ring. I have information that I know
is reliable as to Jeff's condition, and
therefore can state positively that there
will be absolutely no hitch."
Just when the champion will leave
the springs is not definitely settled yet,
though in all probability Tuesday will
be the day. Delaney stated that the
party may remain a day longer, or pos
sibly postpone their stay until Thurs
day. He communicated with Manager
Coffroth to that effect, and the latter
told Delaney to use his own judgment
and leave when he thought best.
JeJf has two tempting offers to star
with minstrel trounes. one at the St.
Louis Exposition and the other on the
Eastern circuit. As the former Is the
more enticing it is likely the big boiler
maker will be taking his turn as an end
man and rapping the bag about should
he be successful in stowing the big
miner away.
It was vacation time at Munroe's
yesterday, and the only thing Jack did
was to take his customary spin on the
road and a plunge into the sea. He
lounged about the tavern all day and
thousands flocked to the place to get a
giimpse of the much-talked-of first
artist.
Tom King proved the best in the
open stake event, beating Golden For

of 11 to 5. The coursing in the stake

I will recommend that these young men come
to California or to Colorado, where they can
enjoy the same If not milder climatic condi

experience during their studies that Is not af

Truly Shattuck and Marcel's living
art studies and bas-reliefs are still
leading attractions on thÂ« Orpheum
bill. Of the wtek's new acts 'Mike,"
Foster's dog, and Mile. Louise Agoust,
with Charles H. Weston & Co., give
high satisfaction.
Truly Shattuck opens with a dainty
Irish ballad, and when the last of her
three numbers Is rendered the audience
offers applause without stint. Most of
the bas-reliefs and poses by the Marcel
combination are new, and one, "A
spartan mother receiving the body of
her son," is particularly striking.
Mile. Louise Agoust is one of the
famous Agoust family that has ap
peared on the boards in\this city, and
she does clever juggling. The comic
skits of Weston while she works
brighten up the act considerably.
"Mike" is a clever dog and offers an
example of extraordinary canine Intel

Comedy Four and Leah Russell com
plete the show.
The difference between the work of
the stage carpenter and tha.t\ of the
playwright must be evident, to every
one who saw the two war plays pro
duced by the Oliver Morosco Company
at the Californiaâ the somewhat life
less dramatization of Cable's "The Cav
alier," presented -last week, and Wil
liam Gillette's dashing, well-construct
ed drama, "Secret Service," in which
the caoable players opened last even
ing for their final week but onei Be
tween author and actor the spectator
had a goo.d time last night. Honors,
too, were evenly distributed, although,
as usual, the center of the stage was
apt to be where Amelia Gardner stood.
Her rendering of the character of Edith
Varney is full of sympathy and force.
But the piece was not written for the
heroine, and Howard Gould as Dumont,
the Union sj>y masquerading as the
Confederate Captain Thorne, had a
part wholly to his liking and won a dis
tinctly personal triumph. His work in
the tremendous third actâ the scene in
the War Department's telegraph office
at Richmond â was strong, simple, com
plete, and it won deserved applause.
Just behind these leaders two young
players merit much praise. Miss EtSle
Esmond's genuinely girlish Caroline
Mitford was the most winning frgure
in the performance. /Harry Mestayer's

<iDr. A. E. Salazar, professor of elec
tricity of the National University . of
Santiago,. Chile, who has been commis
sioned by his Government to visit the
prominent Institutions of learning in
this country, arrived in this city last
eveningandlsstaying at the Palace. The
professor has come. West mainly to visit
the California and Stanford univer
sities, with" a view of acquiring infor
mation regarding the methods of in
stiuctlon followed In their technological
departments. â¢ He has already visited
many of the universities of the East
and Middle West and carefully studied
the organization of technical education
in those institutions and on his way
West he stopped over in Colorado to
inspect the big power plants and later
he visited the big power plant at Col
gate, In this State. In discussing his
trip last evening Dr. Salazer said his
visit to the West had so far been
fraught with interesting surprises and
he added: j
At Berkeley and Palo Alto I expect to find
much valuable information, for I have read
a great deal about those institutions and have
been wonderfully impressed with what I have
learned regarding the advantages they afford
the young student for gleaning practical
knowledge. In Chile the Government is doing
a great deal toward giving Us young men
technical educations, but one disadvantage the
latter experience Is the fact that the Instruc
tion is all concentrated In the University of
Santiago. Your universities are marvels. In
my report to my Government, which will be
made after I have visited the California and
Stanford universities, I will make one sugges
tion to my people which I think will be keenly
appreciated by them.
