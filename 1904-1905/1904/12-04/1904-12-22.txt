NEW YORK. Dec. 2Lâ That "Wall
street is suffering from an attack of
"nerves'* was developed Jo-day when
the annual report of Commissioner of
Corporations Garfield was published,
severely denouncing present conditions
surrounding the laws governing cor
porations engaged to interstate com
merce. The language employed by
Commissioner Garfield shocked Wail
street's sensitive temperament and the
stock market had a fit of the blues.
Industrial shares, led by Amalgamated
Copper, became weak and timid ones
threw blocks of stock on the market
"Here is Secretary Shaw telling us
one day that there is not a cloud on
the financial horizon." said one eminent
broker, "and the next day we are in
formed "that governmental control of
railroads is necessary, while on the
third day we are confronted with an
announcement virtually stating that
the industrial enterprises of the coun
try should be regulated by the Federal
authorities. With these momentous
questions, affecting every security
holder in the United States, under dis
cussion, it is plain that there are a
great many ominous clouds hovering
around us."

they were over President Roosevelt's

The morning conference was attend
ed by seventy-five well known Repub
licans, most of them classed as being
in favor of Senator Depew, but there
were also not a few who are believed
to be opposed to his candidacy. The
speeches in the conference were almost
without exception strongly In favor of
Senator Depew's re-election. No vote
was taken and estimates of the numer
ical classification of those present vary
with the sympathies of those estimat
ing.
After the conference Senator Platt
declared himself as greatly pleased
with its character and personnel.
"I am proud of it," said he. "It was
truly representative and clearly showed
what I have all along claimed, that
the sentiment of the people of the State
is strongly for the re-election of Sen

be to tone down Mr. Odell."
Senator Platt himself called the con

LONDON, Dec. 22.â The Dally Tele
graph's Chefu correspondent says that
the steamship Lady Mitchell, which
sailed from Tsingtau with supplies,
ammunition and dynamita, reached
Port Arthur during a snowstorm four
nights ago. He also says that it is
rumored that the Japanese were com
pelled to evacuate their position on
Ktze Mountain owing to a flanking fire
from other forts and the explosion of
Russian mines, from which they lost
heavily.
The Japanese, the correspondent
adds, are employing thousands of
coolies in making strong forts at Dainy
and around Port Arthur. They ex
press a determination to capture Port
Arthur before the Chinese New Year.
An attack Is now being prepared that
will be on a hitherto unequaled scale
and it will mean either success or ter
rible disaster to the besiegers.
The correspondent concludes by say
ing that General Nogi has asked for
60,000 reinforcements from Japan.
The correspondent at Peking of the
Times telegraphs:
"China having consented to pay the
indemnity growing out of the Boxer
troubles, in gold, the Ministers of Rus

of the north fort of East Keekwan
Mountain on December 18 by the Japa
nese is of much importance, because
it opens a way up the gorge to the
higher hills and will -render easier the
capture of the mountain. It gives
much additional foothold for a general

TOKIO, Dec. 20.â Admiral Togo, who

the Sevastopol Is disabled. Great
weight Is attached to Togo's personal
observations and opinion, instanced by
the fact that when the Russian bat
tleship Petropavlovsk was sunk Togo
was one of the few officers of the en
tire Japanese fleet whose eye caught
the vision of speedy disaster. â 
Commander Yezoe, who was killed
while torpedoing the Sevastopol, has
been promoted and has been given oth
er posthumous honors.
The Japanese army besieging Port
Arthur reported to-day as followed the
trophies captured by the Japanese In
the fort of North Keekwan Mountain:
, "Further Investigation shows that we
captured five 8.2 quick-firing Held guns,
two 47-millimeter quick-firing guns,
one of them being serviceable; two 24
millimeter guns, one being serviceable;
four machine guns, all serviceable; six
teen rifles, 461 rounds of great gun am
munition; 250 rounds of 47-millimeter
ammunition; 240 rounds of 24-mllllmeter
gun amunition; 1160 rounds of machine
gun ammunition; 15,000 rounds of small
arms ammunition; 80 grenades and
nine star shells, all serviceable; six
cases of oowder and timber, sandbags,
clothing, etc.".
The following report from Manchu
rian headquarters was received last
night and made public to-day:
"On Monday at 5 o'clock in the after
noon the enemy's artillery east of Da
Mountain bombarded the neighborhood
of Slnlintung. At 1 o'clock in the
morning of Tuesday the enemy's infan
try attacked us south of Pleniuhung
pao and at Tatsupao. By 4 o'clock in
the morning he was repulsed. Simul
taneously the enemy's infantry at
tached Chinshanting. Heilintung and
Huangtia and made a most vigorous
attack in the neighborhood of Chln
sbantung. The fighting continued
about an hour, when the enemy was
completely reoulsed. We had no casu
alties."
The examination of the cargo, pas
sengers and crew of the British steam
ship Nigretia, which was seized by
the Japanese cruiser Tsushima on De
cember 19, is progressing at Sasebo.
Seemingly it is undetermined whether
parole-breaking Russian officers are on
board the Nigretia. The Japanese are
carefully Investigating this feature of
the case, because of the question of the
ability of the Chinese officials to "prop
erly conduct the internement of Rus
sians who seek refuge at ports in
China. It is considered vitally impor
tant.

Police Commissioner â¢ H. W. Hutton
sprang a sensation at the regular meet
ing of the board last night. In a signed
statement to the commission be said he
had proof that demonstrated to his sat
isfaction that every policeman who had
served in Bacon place for some time
past was. guilty of accepting bribes
from the unfortunates that frequent
the dens> of the quarter. They should
be dismissed from the force without
even a hearing, he said, and asked his
associates on the board to Join him in
a request to the City. Attorney for an
opinion as to the legality of .the charter
amendment guaranteeing to every po
liceman the right of trial on â  charges

remarkable point of -Hutton's request
ir. the fact that the details in Bacon
place are changed practically every
twenty-four hours and the' dismissal
of every man that has served therein
during "a reasonable time last past"
would mean the practical wiping out
of the police force as it is now con
stituted.
Hutton's statement in full Is as fol
lows:
BAN FRANCISCO, Dec 21, 1904.*
To the Honorable Board of Police Commis
sioners of the City an<5 County of Pan Fran
cisco â Gentlemen: Having been Informed that
money wÂ»Â» belnr paid to police officers for
protection at Bacon place, on the south side
of Pine etreeC Â«â¢ little easterly of Dupont
street. I conducted a personal Investigation
and ''alter diligent and Â«ecret research I have
proved to my own satisfaction that each pros
titute occupy Ins a crib therein pays the' sum
of 23 cents per day Into a common fund, which
I am informed Is handled by a woman who is
known as "BlÂ» Marie," and she has for some
time past paid to each of the patrolmen on the
morning watch at that place thÂ« ram of $2
per day and to each of the policemen on duty
from 3 to 11 p. m. the sum of (3 per day.
I am told that the money Is paid
as follows: There is situated on the east
erly side of Bacon place a . saloon
known as the "Klondyke." it has an en
trance en Pine street and one on Bacon
place. "Big Marie" at about a certain hour
enters It from Bacon place, and when the po
liceman stationed there sees her enter be
enters and roes to a small box In the rear,
where Maria has proceeded. The money Is
there passed to the policeman, and. Marl*
leavrs the way she entered and the policeman
does likewise. If there u any one present In
the saloon "Bis Marie" shakea hands with the
policeman In Bacon place and the money U
passed that way. ,
On Saturday the aggregate is $12, instead of
$10 per day. end on' Sunday $11 u paid. I am
aware that the policemen on that beat are con
tinually changed, but I believe it is an under
stood thing and the money is paid, and almost
every policeman going there knows what to
expect to do. â¢ â  . â¢
I state further to you that in my Judgment
It Is Impossible to secure legal proof of the
above matters; the policemen receiving the
money i wtU deny recelYlng It. the party pay
lag will deny having paid it and the girls
will deny they ever paid 23 cents to any such
fund, and the proprietor' of the Klondyke will
deny that Marie was ever in hU place but
that it Is paid I am sure, and I am satisfied
that It Is Impossible to trap any one.
In my opinion, the only way to prevent this
state of facts is to remove the detail; they
have accomplished nothing while 'there
Suppress Bacon place at any cost, and if we
can get an opinion from the City Attorney
that the provision of thÂ« charter requiring a
trial for police Is unconstitutional, as I bellev*
it Is, I think It would be beneflcJal to the de
partment to dismiss without trial every one
on the Bacon place detail within Y reasonable
time past. I will furnish sufficient proof to
satisfy you that such action is Justifiable. '
The above matters were given to me in con
fidence by parties interested, and under my
promise not to divulge their, names, and none
of the above information w t8 received from
any member of the , force, and I have di
rected no. member of the force in the receipt
of any of the above money. Very respect
fully. \- -.' H. W. HUTTON.
But Hutton was destined to be rap
ped over the knuckles by his associates.
Reagan said that he was opposed to
any: such measure as Hutton advocat
ed. He eaid it would not only' be un
wise but would be un American to deny
any man '), the \ right to a hearing and
that the moral certainty of any one
man as to , the guilt of any person did
not .wrcessarlly mean that;; such .person
was guilty. Again Hutton has used in
his report the | statement, that ' In \ his
opinion "almost every man" Was guilty
of receiving money,; from these fallen

THE THEATERS.
PRICE FIVE CENTS
NEW YORK, Dec. 21.â Thomas W.
Lawson's declaration of war has draws
fire from nai â quarters. James R.
Keene, master manipulator of the mar
ket, to-day made public a letter which
he had written to the Boston operator
relative to transactions in Amalgam
ated Copper stock. All Wall street Trill
be lost In wonder that such a communi
cation should be made public, but since
Lawson has threatened to publish the
communication and has not done so
Keene has taken the initiative and pub^
llshed it himself. V
In the letter Keene admita having
f ? fo JL^ H -' Rocera Â«"> hi3 asso
ciates $22,000,000 of Amalgamated Cop
per stock at between 90 and 96. and
tells of his refusal on the further in
stance of Rogers to put the price to a
higher figure in a subsequent move
ment, which, Keena said, would invita
a collapse in price. That the price was
advanced and the collapse came Is a
matter of Wall street history. Who en
gineered the later 111 starred movement
is left to conjecture.
Wall street has thriven on the mys
tery as to who made the market move
ments. The shipbuilding scandal
showed the employment of one manip
ulator to "sell our stock first" for a
banking firm. Keene's letter acknowl
edges that he was employed by Rogers
and his associates to work off Amal
raznated Copper at from 90 to 96, which
has since broken to 33.
OTHERS TAKE UP GAGE.
From other quarters has Lawson
drawn fixe. Former United States Sen
ator Hlj?glS3 of Delaware pauses to
make denial of certain statements. Life
insurance officials come forward to de
fend their position and the New York
Commercial, which Lawson said was
the personal organ and property of H.
H. Rogers, issues an editorial denial of
that charge while admitting that
Rogers has a small Interest In thÂ«
property.
Lawson apparently has nothing to
fear from the threats of criminal pros
ecution, as none will prosecute him for
bis "Frenzied Finance" articles. This
statement was definitely made to-day,
and * in the same breath it was an
nounced that two weeks ago District
Attorney Jerome refused to submit a
complaint to the Grand Jury at the re
quest of Samuel Untermyer. The Dis
trict Attorney said that Untermyer*a
complaint. would have to be made the
subject of an examination before a city
magistrate before it could be taken up
by the Grand Jury. Not wishing to go
through bothersome court proceedings,
all thought of a criminal prosecution
was dropped.
There seems to be some question as
, to Just how much money was paid to.
| settle the Delaware suit brought by
I William Buchanan and the discharge
j ol Dwight Braman as receiver of
Bay State Ga3. Elverton R. Chapman
said he carried $225,000 down to WI1
mineton and that he paid out all but
$15,000 to various claimants In the of
fice of Senator Gray. Roger Foster, a
lawyer, says he got the money in bulk
from Chapman and paid â  It over him
self.
WHO ADVANCED THE 3IONEY? :
From another source It was learned
that Buchanan got $75,000 and Foster
and Braman $2i.00O each, or a total of
S125.CCO. Fester admits there were ten
or more Interests that had to be set

$210,000 the difference of $35,000 must
have gone to others besides Braman
and their lawyers. It was said that

Loss of Hill Not
Regarded as -

ST. PETERSBURG. Dec. 21- â Mili
tary critics here do not attach vital
importance to the capture of the
north fort of Keekwan Mountain. They
declare it is not part of the main line
of defenses of Port Arthur and there
fore is without direct influence on the
late of ihe fortress.
Whilr declining to- give details, the
Admiralty admits that Russian advices
from Fort Arthur, sent by General
Stoessel, substantially confirmed the
Japanese advices of the partial wreck
ing of the Russian ships in the har
bor and the .censor has been instructed
to permit the publication of the dis
patches. It is claimed that several of
the larger ships ant! a respectable
Xiumber of torpedo-boat destroyers are
still seaworthy, but they are not being
considered as a factor in the coming
fight between Admiral Togo's ships
â¢ lid the Russian second Pacific squad
ron.
The whole series of misfortunes
vhiÂ«-h has attended the Port Arthur
squadron is a bitter chapter in Rus
sian naval annals, but since the ar
rival of the 2a lest advices there has
been 1^5* disposition to criticize Rear
Admiral . Wiren's failure to make a
â¢ortie. General Stoessel having decided
that further defense of the fortress
tvould be impossible if the guns of the
varships and the sailors landed were
re-embarked. Had the ships been able
to go out under the conditions exist-
Inr they would have been at the
mercy of the Japanese and have been
sacrificed without hope of inflicting
commensurate damage.
The mobilization announced yester
<!ay of the reserves in seven military
districts affects a portion of about half
of the military- districts of Russia.
"While some of the reserve men called
to the colors will be used to complete
the strength of the regiments" going
to the front, by far the greater num
ber will be formed into reserve units
to replace troops which have already
gone to the Far East.
Tills year the conscripts taken num

Slavs and Brown
Join-in Its
Pursuit.
ON THE FRONT LINE OF THE
RUSSIAN DEFENSE, BELOW MUK
DEN, Nov. 20.â We have just come in
from a ride around the front. It was
nearly a mile to the extreme front,
throughout fields of the giant millet
of Manchuria, which is being rapidly
burned for fuel. Whole villages of
Chinese â  huts" have been robbed of
every particle -of woodwork for the
same purpose. Nearly the whole of
the army is living underground, where
budy heat has to serve instead of fires.
j Toward noon we came to an exten
sive entrenchment and â¢ encampment,
where numero us -little fixes were burn
ing and big kettles swung from cross
sticks, showing that the soldiers were
preparing tea. Here the. general com
manding and a group of staff officers
welcomed us and in addition to the
tea one of them actually produced a
lemon to go with it. How a lemon
e\er got into that part of Manchuria
was a mystery that the lieutenant re
fused to solve.
There was a disturbance toward the
forward line of trenches that might
have presaged a Japanese attack and
wo rushed to a knoll that commanded
a view. There, from a seemingly de
serted Chinese hut rushed a half
grown pig â a shote of the Manchur
ian razorback variety. After it a
Cossack followed in hot pursuit. Other
Cossacks joined the chase, but the pig.
threading the trenches, gained the
open ground and headed for the Jap
anese lines, less than 400 yards away.
Reckless of death, or .anything else,
six Cossacks dashed in ' pursuit, . with
their long brown coats tucked around
their waists. But the pig headed across
the imaginary dividing line and
charged the Japanese position. The
opposite hill slope, to all appearance*,
had been vacant and silent as the
grave, but a hidden trench suddenly
gave up a party of Japanese, and away
they went after the pig. The Cossacks
stopped and the Japanese headed the
pig diagonally back toward the Rus
sian lines. They did not catch it, but a
fresh relay of Russians took up the
chase and the pig veered over again to
the Japanese.
Not a shot was fired in all this time
and the Japanese and Cossacks stood
within a hundred paces of one another
in the open, laughing at one another's
non-euccess and hurling mutual male
dictions after the pig. The- laet we saw
of it, the pig was keeping strictly to
the neutral strip between the forces
and holding westward in the direction
of the Llao River. = 'â¢â ". ;.â - â â .;. :.v
The general laughed, though he also
sighed at the thought of the vanished
pig, and Invited us over to have more
tea at his "palace."
â¢ "I do not patronize anything but pal
aces," he explained, as we mounted to
follow him, "and there being none here
abouts I had one built,"
It was down a steep trail, where the
horses fairly sat' down and slid on the
frozen ground. Overhanging the edge
of a narrow valley was "the palace, a
more than unusually commodious dug
out, and inside was a .stove 'cunningly
built into the wall with home-made
bricks. It had had a fire in it the day
before and was shut up tight and still
warm. Before It on the ground sat
Prince Radzivil, just: come in- from a
scout, and warming his red hands
against the brrcks.- There was a table
and a tiny window letting In a little
light from "a tunnel on one side. And
hot tea. without lemon this time, added
to the joys of living.

Although to buy or sell a ticket in

Prussia's most annoying competitor
by raising the capital prize and then

Scarcity of Water Threatens to

Special Dispatch to The Call.
PITTSBURG. Pa., Dec. 21.â The
Pittsburg Coal Company . has found it
impossible to run its mines, on account
of the three months' drought! which is
assuming alarming proportions, and to
day It announced that until further
notice there would be no work 'for its
unmarried men. All those who have
families dependent upon them will be
taken care of, eo far as possible,. though
it may be necessary to shift them from
mine to mine. About ten thousand un
married men were ordered off work to
day.
This Is the first time in the history
of mining in western. Pennsylvania
that so many mines have been ordered
closed through drought. " Little \ or no
coal has been" sent down the river since
late in the summer and it will now take
several days' , rain to start coal out
and open up the mines.
The scarcity of water also has caused
the coke ovens and the railroads to
partially suspend operations, and un
less relief comes soon the mills will be
seriously affected. "
The public schools of Wilmerding
and Wilkinsburg, near here, were dis
missed to-day on account of no water.
The production of the coke region is
demoralized. The output of the ovens
has been reduced one-third and the loss
is estimated. at $1,000,000 a month.
The Westmoreland Water Company,
which suplles Greensburg, I Jeanette,
Pennmanor and Irwin, announces there
is barely enough water to last through
the week and it will be necessary to
shut %>ff water to keep enough for flre
fighting purposes.
Eight towns in Turtle Creek Valley
were without water to-day and there
were great dread of fire and many un

ROMNEY CANVAS
BRINGS FORTUNE
ftoiiiaiitic Story Back of
Recent Sale of Picture
in London for $34,125
Special Dispatch to The CalL
LONDON, Dec. 21.â Behind the sale
of a Romney picture at Christie's for
6500 guineas ($34,125) lies a romance.
It opens forty years ago at the little
seaport and mining town of White
haven, on the Cumberland coast. A
small tradesman 4 had fallen into diffi
culties' and a sale was held of his
household effects, which wag attended
chiefly by frugal housewives in search
of bargains In the shape of pots and
pans and second-hand furniture. Their
interest slackened when the auctioneer
unrolled three grimy canvases, and a
local wight, who had strayed upon the
scene, bought the lot. for a. few shill
ings,, without the faintest idea that
among them was an art treasure that
would be worth a fortune some day.
In fact, he cared little for pictures him
self and bought them more as a joke
than anything else.
Among the women present was Mrs.
John Tomlinson, bent on picking up
cheaply some articles of domestic utiL
ity. Her husband was a civil servant
of sorts, being a "Government distribu
tor of stamps," and a man of some in
telligence, with a liking for pictures.
Thrifty Mrs. Tomlinson did not believe
in wasting money on such things her
self, but she told John of the incident.
The 'next day he sought but the pur
chaser, who gave himself credit for
displaying remarkable shrewdness In
selling them again for twice what he
had paid for them. â¢
â¢ .Tomlinson stretched . the canvases
and hung them in his house. He had no
idea at. that time. of the amazing value
of his find. Some "painter chaps" in
the neighborhood told> him. that they
were certainly good pictures, which he
regarded as a flattering tribute to his
own Judgment and cultured taste.. On
the strength of them, .as the years
rolled by, he acquired quite a local rep
utation as an art connoisseur. â¢ Artists
visiting; the neighborhood frequently
dropped in .upon him and admired his
little . collection. He received several
local offers for them; which he stub
bornly resisted. . .. :
One artist settled at Whitehaven re
peatedly tried to . induce him^ to .part
with the Romney canvas. He was not
quite certain that it was a Romney,
and the price he., offered was only a
fraction. of what it fetched at auction,
but it represented a prodigious sum to
Tomlinson. Still he declined. He had
enough to keep him in comfort in his
old age, and he did not hanker after
riches. Strangely enough, no news of
the Whitehaven treasure ever reached
the ears of the bis dealers, and. in con
sequenre none of the hungry roving
commissioners of the art world ever,
descended on the town of the under
sea mines. , i ~
Tomlinson- died intestate when near
ly 90. Some of the heirs wrote to Chris
tie's about his pictures. One of the ex
perts of the firm was dispatched north
and saw. at a' glance the richness of
Whltehaven's secret. Very '
was ;the scene at Christie's sale from
that other, sale forty years earlier. The
place was jammed. For two and a half
hours', the patient sightseers awaited
the appearanpe.pn the eas^l of the pic
ture, .w.hich -the Whitehaven house
wives had'eyed with disdain. :
At length the r unfranied canvas,, bo
lohgthe adornment' of Â»i humble man-,
.tel piece,*: was hoisted up. Hundreds of
v wedged elbows stiffened. -Hundreds of
enger^eyes turned to the picture. The
dealers; cleared their throats.

the eldest of them, and the battle had
begun.
The bidding advanced by hundred
guinea stages until an impressive pause
proclaimed that the limit had been
reached and the fall of the hammer
terminated the scene. Lockett Agnew,
the well-known London dealer, had se
cured It for $34,500 in American money.
The two other Whitehaven pictures
which were included in the sale â por
traits by Tilly Kettle and painted some
time prior to 178Jâ fetched $1285. The
lot that had been sold for a few shill
ings in 1864 realized $35,410 in 1904. Such
is the romance of picture buying!
The Romney picture represents two
little children, one a girl . carrying a
doll, and the other a mite of a boy, ap
parently her brother, walking proudly
by her side, as though intent on pro
tecting her with his toy gun. The paint
ing of the two heads, especially that of
the little maid, is of excellent bloom.,
But the canvas has been sadly neglect
ed and there are traces of village paint
upon it. After undergoing careful
treatment at the hands of the skilled
picture mender its appearance will be
greatly improved. When next sold it
may fetch several thousand dollars
more than Agnew paid for it. The
highest recorded price paid for a Rom
ney at an auction sale is $53,275.
How such a fine specimen of Rom
ney's work originally reached White
haven is a mystery that has not yet
been fathomed. But its discovery has
led to a lot of rummaging among dusty
lumber rooms all over the country, and
every mail brings dozens of letters to
Christie's requesting them to send ex
perts to examine pictures which the
writers are convinced are Romney'a or
Gainsborough's.

William Alvord came to San Francis
co In 1853. He was born in Albany,
New York, January 3. 1833. When he
was seventeen years old he began busi

New York City. Three years later he
arrived in San Francisco and followed
the same line of business two years In
the same capacity. In 1S55 he estab

THE VALUE OF CHARCOAL.
Few PeÂ©i-l2 Know How Useful It Is in
Preserring Health and Beauty.
Nearly everybody knows that char-
coal is the safest and most efficient
disinfectant and purifier in nature,
but few realize its value when taken
into the human system for the same
cleansing purpose.
Charcoal is a remedy that the more
you take of it the better; it is not a
drug at all. but simply absorbs the
gases and impurities always present
in the stomach and intestines and car-
ries them out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after
â¢smoking, drinking or after eating on-
ions and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and im-
proves the complexion; it whitens the
teeth and further acts as a natural
and eminently safe cathartic.
It absorbs the injurious gases which
collect in the stomach and bowels; it
disinfects the mouth and throat from
the j>oison of catarrh.
All druggists sell charcoal in one
form or another, but probably the
best charcoal and the most for the
money is in Stuart's Charcoal Lozen-
ges; they are composed of the finest
powdered Willow charcoal and other
harmless antiseptics in tablet form,
or rather In the form of large, pleas-
ant tasting lozenges. -the charcoal be-
ing mixed with honey.
The daily use of these lozenges will
soon tell in a much improved condi-
tion of the general health, better com-
plexion, sweeter breath and -^ purer
blood, and the beauty, of it is that no
possible harm can result from their
'.ontinued use. but, on the contrary,
preat benefit.
A Buffalo physician, in speaking of
the benefits of charcoal, says: "I advise
Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges to all pa-
tients suffering from gas In stomach
and bowels and to dear the complex-
Jon and purify the breath, mouth and
throat: I also believe the liver is
greatly benefited by the daily use of
them; they cost but 25 cents a box at
drug stores and although in some
sense a , patent preparation, yet I be-
lieve I get more and better charcoal
In Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges than in
â¢uqr of the ordinary charcoal tablets."
Francisco. This connection continued
until 1867.
Mr. Alvord went abroad on account
of poor health, in 1SG6.
Upon his return to this city, in 1S67,
he was elected president of the Pacific
Rolling Mill Company and continued as
such during twenty years. His tastes
were artistic. In 1871 he was elected
president of the San Francisco Art As
sociation, a position that he occupied
four successive terms. He was elected
Mayor of San Francisco in IS71 and
filled the mayoralty chair two years.
In 1S73 he was appointed a Commis
sioner of Golden Gate Park and served
until 1SS2. He was also a Police Com
missioner of this city from 1S78 to 1S&9.
CAREER WITH BANK.
His connection with the Bank of Cali
fornia began in November, 1871, when
he was elected a director of the bank to
fill the vacancy occasioned by the death
of William J. Barron. He became vice
president of the bank in October, 1S75.
On the resignation of D. O. Mills, Mr.
Alvord was made president.
In 1890 and 1891 Mr. Alvord was presi
dent of the American Forestry Associa
tion of Washington. D. C. In the lat
ter yearf he was elected president of
the . Alaska-Treadwell Gold Mining
Company. In many other connections
he was given the first place. He wag
made president of the Alaska-Mexican
Gold Mining Company in 1893; of the
California Academy of Sciences In the
same year: president of the San Fran
cisco. Clearing House; president of the
AlasKa United Gold Mining Company.
He was president of these several
bodies at the time of his death.
Mr. Alvord served as president of
the Pacific CIuo, the Loring Club, the
Astromonical Society of the Pacific and
chairman of the local board of direct
ors of the London, Liverpool and Globe
Insurance Company, holding the latter
office many years. At the time of his
death he was also a director of the
Selby Smelting and Lead Works, of
the Security Savings Bank, the United
Railroads of S.in Francisco, the San
Francisco Breweries (Limited), the
Spreckels and Western Sugar Refining
companies And the California Title and
Insurance Company.
A GENTLE MAN. '
While Â£e was prominent in these
varied capacities, he had a strong hold
upon the affections of countless citizens
of California by reason of his gentle
ness and purity of life. Whatever was
low or mean repelled him. To him con
sistently was given the title of gentle
man. He daily visited Golden Gate
Park and fed the birds. His charities
were many and unostentatious.
For some weeks prior to his death
Mr. Alvord had been ailing, but he was
at his desk as late as December 13.
lAst Sunday he. took a drive. When he
died his stepson, Dr. James W. Keeney,
was with him. Mrs. Alvord died some
time ago. Two stepsons, Charles M.
Keeney and Dr. James W. Keeney, sur
vive. There are relatives in the East.
Appropriate action in memory of Mr.
Alvord will be taken by the various
organizations to which he belonged.
The directors of the Bank of California
will adopt resolutions of respect at
their next meeting. The office of pres
ident of the bank will probably remain
vacant untilthe quarterly meeting of
the directors in the second week in
January.
Mr. AJvord evidently knew that he
was in danger of death. Yesterday a
letter was received by the Academy of
Sciences, in which Mr. Alvord had
written that he wished. to resign the
presidency of the academy and that he
bad resigned other positions. . He added
that he was likely to drop from his
chair at any time. Within half an hour
after the letter was opened in the
Academy of Sciences building . news
was received that Mr. Alvord was dead.

ARE DROPPED
Two Prominent Men of the
Rural Service Dismissed
by Postmaster General
POLITICS THE CAUSE
Executive Board of National
Association Soon to Meet
to Take Up the Subject
WASHINGTON. Dec. 21â Postmaster
General Wynne to-day removed two
more rural carriers for alleged efforts
to influence legislation, the employes
being H. E. Nivin of Berthoud, Colo.,
and J. W. Whitehead of Medina, Ohio.
Nivin is chairman of the executive
board of the National Rural Carriers'
Association. Whitehead also is a mem
ber of the executive board and is sec
retary of the Ohio State organization of
the carriers.
The plans for the campaigner legis
lation carried on prior to the' November
election by President Cunningham and
Secretary Tumber, both of whom were
recently dismissed as the result of an
investigation of their work, were, it is
charged by the postal authorities, ap
proved and indorsed by both Nivin. and
Whitehead.
The report on the investigation points
out that Nivln's plan was that the
rural carriers in each State should look
into the question of supporting the can
didates for election or re-election to
Congress in their State and to such of
these candidates as proved "true" to
the carriers the association would
pledge its support for any political
honors sought in the particular State.
It is expected that a meeting of the
executive board of the National Asso
ciation of Letter Carriers, comprising
the carriers in the city service, will be
called immediately after the Christmas
holidays to take action in connection
with the recent dismissal of President
Keller of that organization from the
Government service. This meeting is
made especially necessary by the fact
that Keller, having been dismissed as a
carrier, will not be received or recog
nized in any way at the Postofflce De
partment and his power as head of the
association thereby will be crippled. .
The question of continuing the pres
ent expense account incident to the of
fice of president also is to be consid
ered.

yard â that is, to cut out the appropria
tion of $200,000 recommended for that

yard will be furnished the equipment
necessary for the building of the col

that the collier will be built at Mare

Senator Perkins and Representative
Knowland had a long conference with
Admiral Capps after the action of the

the Pacific Coast with regard to naval
construction at the navy, yards in
such a light that it is probable the
admiral will revise his testimony given
before the House committee, which is
now before him for review. It was
shown that the bill providing for the.
building of a collier at a. navy yard on
the Pacific Coast had already been
passed by Congress, and that it could
not be carried out until the yard had
been equipped for the work.
Senator Perkins says the provision
will be Included in the naval appropri

TWO SITES FOR LIBRARY
FIND PUBLIC FAVOR.
Merits oM3otfi Are Under Discussion
One Lot Is That Recommended as "Civic
Center" by Architect Burnham.
To-morrow afternoon the Joint Com
mittee on Finance and Utilities of
the Board of Supervisors will, it is
said, finally consider the question of
the selection <>f<a site for the new Pub
lic Library. A discussion that has
arisen 3S to the merits of proposed
sites, two in particular, lends added
interest to the question, and it is prob
able that the body that must determine
between them will be overwhelmed by
the opinions of those most interestedâ
cpinions based in the main on civic In
terest, but some, undoubtedly, on the
motive of personal gain.
Eliminating properties that are weak
in public support but at the same time
have been seriously considered in the
j.ast as desirable sites for the library,
the forces that are seeking to bring this
Ciuestion to final decision are found ral
lied around two blocks, one body in
interest advocating the selection of
block G7 of the Western Addition,
bounded by Van N'ess avenue. Grove,
Polk and Fulton streets; the other urg
ing the purchase of Western Addition
block 73. bounded by Van Ness avenue,
Hayes. Feli and Franklin streets. Each
tide engaged In the discussion has vari
ous points to make that are worthy of
the fullest consideration, but, briefly
stated, the question seems to rest on
clashing interpretations of the ideas of
D. H. Burnham. the distinguished
Chicago architect, under whose direc
tion plans are being prepared for the
adornment of San Francisco.
The advocates of the purchase by the
city of block 67 lay the greatest stress
en the claim that in his plans to beau
tify San Francisco Architect Burn
ham, who is now in Manila, includes
this site In his proposed "Civic Center."
a district including and lying directly
west of the City Hall, from which mag
nificent buildings, dedicated to the pub
lic use, Bhall rise from the green of a
public park. But they go beyond
the claim that Architect Burnham has
decreed that the district described shall
be the "civic centef " of San Francisco.
Rnd cite specific cases of official action
they say rhould be permitted to pre
vail.
â¢ BOARD SPECIFIED SITE.
When the Board of Supervisors called
for a vote of the people on the question
of voting bonds for a new Public Li
brary, block 67 was specifically named
as the proposed librarv site, but, to
gnard against exorbitant demands, the
board inserted the additional clause,
"or upcyi a parcel or lot of land of simi
lar size and like value and in the im
mediate neighborhood of said block or
parcel of land hereinbefore described
(block 67), and the estimated cost of the
land to be acquired is $647,000." The
insertion of the provisional clause, the
advocates of block 67 say, was for but
one purpose, to hold the owners of
block 67 down to the figure named in
the call for the bond election, and in
no way contemplated the abandonment
of the site upon any other contingency.
The advocates of block 67 further
claim that the site has been officially
appraised and has come within the sum
allowed for the purchase of the library
eite; that the fact that block 67 was
named as the proposed site in the call
fqr election gives it the weight of pub
lic sanction; that It has been virtually
approved by the architect and by the
City Engineer and that It can be ac
quired within the amount of the appro
priation without the necessity of con
demnation proceedings, which, , they
Kay, would involve delay and uncertain
expenditures.
Continuing, they gay that block 67 Is
accessible bv four lines of street rail
ways, and that If accepted by the
Board of Supervisors would not only be
within easy reach of all the people, but
would establish at once a great struc
ture from which Mr. Burnham could
extend his plans and would supplv a
definite nucleus around which the new
and beautiful city of San Francisco, as
planned by that architect, could grow.
But to all this argument those that
ftror block 73 have an answer. Favor-

ceptable as an Xmas

ing the choice of this block are the
Public Library Trustees and the Asso
ciation for the Improvement
Adornment of San Francisco, at the in
stance of which Mr. Burnham began
his plans for the adornment of the city.
They say that the' assertion that Mr.
Burnham has definitely decided upon a
proposed '"civic center" is based upon
erroneous information. They say Mr.
Burnham has considered not one but
a half-dozen proposed civic centers;
that none of his plans have gone far
ther than a tentative state of prepara
tion and that he has committed him
self to no definite plan, but is working
out a half-dozen ideas that must be
passed upon by those that will pay for
their execution before the final work of
the architect can even begin.
Block 73, they further point out,
faces on the proposed extension' of the
panhandle â a proposed Improvement
once â¢ submitted to the people and
ratified by them by a two-thirds
maiority, but which subsequently
failed of execution through a legal
hiatus that occurred between the
dethroning of the old consolida
tion' act and the crowning of the
new charter. The extension of the
panhandle, they say, is bound to come
in time and point to the fact that in
his report Architect Burnham him
self said that no better highway to
Golden Gate Park could be devised
than to extend the panhandle, and
such proposed, extension would be in
cluded in his general plans.
PROJECTS ARE DISCUSSED.
The probability of the extension of
the panhandle and the question of the
establishment of a proposed "Civic
Center" were both fully discussed by
the library trustees and the Adorn
ment Association before they agreed
to recommend the selection of block
73. the advocates of that site say.
With a rough draft of the proposed
"Civic Center," including block 67, be
fore them they turned to block 73,
holding that as this parcel of land is
only one. block from Market . street
the erection of the library upon it
would furnish a magnificent monu
ment to grace the panhandle entrance
If the extension plan is carried
through. It would also eradicate, they
say, a number of shops that are any
thing but ornamental and If permitted
to stand would greatly detract from the
beauty of the splendid entrance to
Golden Gate Park that is contemplated.
It Is further asserted by the advo
cates of block 73 that block 67 was
never appraised; that it was an ad-
Joining piece of property that was
appraised and the figures subsequently
accepted by the owners of block '67.
The- further say that block 73 can be
purchased well within the appropria
tion and that the claim that block 67
can be purchased within the appro
priation without the expense of con
demnation proceedings is one not to
be considered, because the city would
insist upon such condemnation pro
ceedings for its own protection and to
definitely establish the value of the
site by means of expert testimony.
INTANGIBLE CONDITIONS.
â¢ As a further argument in support of
their advocacy of the purchase of
block 73 they say that as both the pro
posed "Civic Center" and the extension
of the panhandle are at the present
time intangible conditions" on which
to base an argument, the balance
should be in favor of block 73, because
even if both of the^e" projects fall
through, the placing of the library on
block 73 will insure it a conspicuous
position, while, on the other hand,
block 67 would relegate the library to a
position, unless the proposed "Civic
Center" materialized, as inconspicuous
as that occupied by the new postoffice,
which they describe as a "buried monu
ment."
It would be easier for Mr. Burnham
to shift his proposed "Civic Center,"
they say in conclusion, than it would
be to move the new library to a con
spicuous site In event the people re
fuse to gee the need of a "Civic Cen
ter" and reject all plans that make
block 67 the key of^a scheme that now
seems so picturesque â when the people
are not being asked to pay for the en
joyment of their contemplation. ,
However the question rests with 'the
Supervisors. Th,ey will determine the
merits of these arguments to-morrow.

LAWYERS HONOR
JUDGE PARKER
They Formally Welcome
Him to Ear of New York
at Well-Attended Banquet
VOICES. HIS PLEASURE
Ex-Secretary Root Pays a
High Tribute to Recent
Candidate for President
NEW YORK, Dec. 21.â Alton B. Par
ker, former Chief Justice of the Court
of Appeals of New York and Demo
cratic, candidate for the Presidency in
the last;- campaign, was (he â¢ guest of
honor to-night at a dinner at the Wal
dorf-Astoria. The dinner was given
by. the bench and bar of the city of
New YorK and Republicans and Demo
crats alike were present to honor the
Justice's return to the practice of law.
Among the 450 who attended were
many of the most prominent members
of the legal profession in this city.
Former Justice D. Cady Herrick was
also a. guest.
Justice Morgan J. O'Brien of -the
anpellate division of the Supreme
Court was the presiding officer. The
speakers included former Governor
Frank S. Black, former Secretary of
War Elihu Root, William B. Horn
blower and Judge Parker.
Judge Parker was the center of a
group of well-wishers during the
greater part of the evening. â¢ Before the
speaking began Francis B' Harrison,
the defeated candidate for Lieutenant
Governor, and M. Linn Bruce, the suc
cessful candidate.'approached arm and
aim to greet him. They had not met
before to-night. Judge Parker had
never met Bruce and they chatted
pleasantly together.
. When the Judge rose to speak the
diners arose, waved handkerchiefs and
cheered. . Judge Parker expressed his
gratitude to his hosts for the cordial
welcome extended to him in becoming
a member of the bar in this city.
The notable absence of Jealousy and
the readiness of Its members to recog
nize and applaud the worthy perform
ances of each .other were conditions,
he said, that, have always made the
practice of the profession of the law
in the city of New York exceedingly
attractive and many have come here
from other places, not only in antlcipa
ticn of the substantial rewards they
might meet with and in -the hope of
a wider sphere of active usefulness,
but also to be assoclated*wlth the tra
ditions of the bar here and with the
ambition to be enrolled In the ranks
of its members.
Elihu Root said In part:
"Upon the observation And experi
ence of a practice which must .seem
long to any but my leader, Mr. Par
sons, and out of a full heart and friend
ship and -warm regard for the guest
we honor, it is a pleasure to add my
voice to the expressions of esteem we
give him here. I can say that no in
terests when committed to Judge
Parker's hands have not had Just and
upright consideration. We welcome
him to our bar; we are proud of him
and proud of our bar."

Gould, the freshman student, who yes
terday thwarted the purpose of five
sophomores who sought to kidnap him,
by shooting a revolver over their heads.
An investigation will be made at once
with a view to suspending the hazers
of the young freshman. President But
ler, it was announced, had written, to
Professor Frederick R. Hutton, dean
of the school of applied science, asking
him to Institute a thorough investiga
tion of the affair and inclosing a list
of the names of the men President But
ler had thought had been most promi
nently identified with it. Dean- Hut
ton has requested these sophomores to
meet him at his office to-morrow.
Police Captain Nally was ordered to
day to investigate the shooting by
Kingdon Gould yesterday. Police Com
missioner McAdoo said: "I must take
cognizance of this case. Toung Gould
has no more right to carry a pistol
without a permit than any one else."
indignation at the action of Kingdon
Gould and the desire to secure a large
contingent of freshmen for the sopho
more dinner to-night Was the cause of
a remarkable display of Inter-class ani
mosity at Columbia University to-day.
More than 300 freshmen and sopho
mores engaged In a fierce struggle
about the subway station at Broadway
and One Hundred and Sixteenth streetl
Young Gould himself did not appear
at college to-day, but the sophomores
were determined to take revenge for his
action yesterday. A number of fresh
men, attempting to spirit away Presi
dent Holbert of the flrst-year class in
the sciences, were intercepted by the
waiting sophomores at the One Hun
dred and Sixteenth-street subway sta
tion, and the fight rapidly centered
about there. Surface' traffic was stopped
for more than an hour and the subway
station was wrecked, its glass doors be
ing demolished. Holbert finally escaped
from the crowd and boarded a down
town subway train, but the fight con
tinued, fiercely.

DARING GIBE
AT THE KING
Sir Wilfrid Lawson in His
Terses Takes * a Fling at

jg LONDON, Dec;-ar^Sir WUfrld'.Iiiw-
8op, the apostle- 'of..^temperance.and: |Qa
cial reform, in conjunctionTwlth F/Caf
ruthers Gould, the caricaturist, has : just
Issued a volume of illustrated verses
entitled "Cartoonsin Rhyme and Line."
It is dedicated "To the best of wives
from the worst of poets." So far as
the poetry Is concerned, It suffices to
say that Sir Wilfrid lives up to the
reputation which he gives himself.
But he does certainly put gall and
wormwood into his doggerel. And he
does not care a blt'whom he stings. Of
that the best example is this quatrain
headed, "From Lord Burton to the
King."
"Twas beer, your Majesty, strong beer,
Which, as you know, made me a peer;
If you will only learn to brew.
God knows what it will make of you!
The point of this reference lies in the
fact that when the King visited Lord
Burton recently he. turned a switch
that.set in motion the machinery which
brewed a lot of ale. The lines are as
daring a reference to the King as any
thing ever seen in print In England.
Sir Wilfrid inherited a baronetcy, and.
well content with his seat in Parlia
ment, has no desire to be elevated to
the House of Lords. Peerages have
been conferred on several rich brew
ers, but there is no instance on record
where any man attained to that lofty
honor by the advocacy of teetotalism. \
CURRENT FICTION IJIPROVING.
Richard Whiteing, of "No. 5 John
Street"! fame, has confided to an in
terviewer some Interesting opinions on
current fiction. â¦
"This is not an Augustan age of li
terature," he- says, "but in all our art
there is a far higher standard of me
diocrity than there ever has been in the
past. Our mediocre novel is better than
the old mediocre novel. Our time shows
a marked excellence in averages. The
sheer, force- of .competition has com
pelled novelists to make a serious study
of technique, and there are many
moderns who show a mastery of it
never attained by writers of the past.
I mean-more especially, that direct
study'of nature and character resulting
in the perfect conversation which you
find in our best novels. For down
right excellence of character-drawing,
for forcible likeness to nature, .: you
would find it hard to beat three or, four
modern novelists whom in certain other
respects ,1** cannot always admire.
â  "Of course, we are plagued with
titled heroes and social, snobbery and
irritating conventionalities, which
there is no getting rid of* The real
istic has succeeded the romantic age.
We have I been, brought clctaer to na
ture. Dickens* himself was not so
close to nature a"s Pett Ridge, for
example. This serious study of tech
nique â we have , learned a good deal
from the French â means that the
average novelist is a better novelist;
he is more workmanlike; he Is better
all-rcund than' he used to be.
But I think that . there Is one
defect In our fictionâ It . wants big
themes, it wants great subjects, It
wants lifting into a finer atmosphere."
With books excelling as never be
fore In "perfect conversations" It
would seem ' strange at; .first
thought to account ' for the decadence
of conversation, which > many declare
to be among the lost arts. But, on
second thought, perhaps, that Is the
very thing which most accounts for it.
Books contain such excellent conver
sation that we . no longer go to our
friends for it. And authors themselves
reeerVe their .witty observations and
biting epigrams. for their books.- They
don't give their, best away for nothing.

Carlyle's -books are' far "less ' widely
read than they were twenty.. years ago,
but .Interest â¢ in j the \ man "himself and
the things he said continues unabated. >
Sorrte delightful glimpses of him are \
contained.fn a volume of "Retrospects"
by Professor- William Knight, which
has juistVbe.en published.'- -What, for in
stance,. could 'be more characteristic of
tho most -Intolerant of sages than this:
r^He/was imce.'speakingr about Darwin
jn-the broad, Scottish -dialect. Into which
>he often relapsed Jw-hen conversing with
a Scotsman-. , .-He' said: ". 'I ithtnjc that
thejr'rfectGnteeflc men must'expeqt God
Almighty ' to come^to them some fine
mornin' and gle..them a patent to
make a warld, they seem so curious
to know how this one was made.'
"I humbly ventured to say that I
thought him unjust to Darwin and was
trying to explain what I considered
the chief point in Darwin's magnifi
cent theory. He at once interposed:
'Malster Darwin Is no better than John
Mull (Mill) or Maister Herbert Spen
cer; they're" a' magneeflcent asses!" "
When told that family worship was
less common In his native country than
It used to be, Carlyle remarked:
"So much the worse for Scotland."
He lapsed into a long praise of Cal
vinism and when Professor Knight
ventured to suggest that there might
be another side to the question he said
sterr.ly:
"There is no other. It's Calvinism
that makes heroes. It made Oliver,
and there nevÂ»- *â¢â¢ a greater hero
than Oliver." . -
SNEERS AT GLADSTONE.
It is well known that he entertained
a poor opinion of both Disraeli and
Gladstone, as well as of most contem
porary politicians, though it has been
observed that he never spoke disre
spectfully of the former after he had
offered him a title. Professor' Kniaht
quotes him as saying: ;
â¢ "I don't know that Dizzy has got a
conscience. Gladdy has a conscience,
but he Just turns it any way he has
a stomacn* to, , and immediately thinks
It a call from God!"
What an infinite pity It is that Car
lyle never had a Boswell! As'contain
ing an answer to Carlyle's sneer
against him these observations made
by Gladstone to the author are worth
quoting:
"People talk of a change' In opinion
as if it were a disgrace. To me' it is a
sign of life. If you are alive you must
change: It is only the dead who re
main/the "same, and of all charges
brought against a man or party, that of
inconsistency because of changed opin
ion, leading to a change of front, is the
most inept. As trumped up against a
political opponent, It Is usually a mere
party trick. I have changed my point
of view on a score of subjects and my
convictions as to very many of them."

GOVERNOR VAX SANT

Speech of the Sllnnesotan on Freight
Rates Taken to Indicate His
Candidacy.
ST. PAUL, Dec. 21. â Governor Van
Sant to-night addressed a large audi
ence at Hastings, Minn., on "Freight
Rates" and his speech la regarded here
as his entry into the Senatorial con
test for the seat In the United . States
Senate now occupied by Senator Clapp.
The Governor said:
"A freight rate is a tax on erÂ«rythinic
which enters into the life and com
merce of the country. Unreasonable
rates are charged and discrimination!*
are common. These evils exist and
should be remedied. To admit that we
are helpless Is to declare that constitu

ready to Join hands with 'liny man. or
any body of men. to carry on the con
test. Before joining battle, you. would
better take time for reflection. Do you
know the power of corporate wealth?
Do you fully realize the vast influence
it wields? Do you know how merci
lessly It punishes those who stand In
Its way and oppose its will?- I do. And
I enter into this fight wltn thÂ» full
knowledge of j these facts."

LONDON. Dec. 2Lâ London was en

dense than any witnessed during the
last two years. In many places the
traffic was almost completely stopped
and the greatest care was necessary to
avoid accidents, a number of which

As night closed and the density in

circle of a mile, with Trafalgar Square
as the center. It was so opaque that
foot passengers lost their way.
Some of the scenes witnessed were
pitiful, some were ridiculous and the

make the darkness visible. Torch boys
were requisitioned and they did a rush

EVERY BLADE WARRANTED
FIRE DEPARTMENT HEROES ARE PRESENTED
WITH MEDALS IN CITY HALL ROTUNDA.
Scannell Tokens Given Brave Men by Mayor
(HEROES OF THE MUNICIPAL FIRE DEPARTMENT WHOM MAYOR SCHMITZ YESTERDAY DECORATED WITH THE I
eCAXNELL MEDAL IN RECOGNITION OF THElR BRAVERY IN RISKING THEIR LIVES TO SAVE THE LIVES OF
OTHERS. THE BOY.'S RESCUER ALSO RECEIVED ADDITIONAL GIFTS. . UVh!i Â°* j
Two heroes of the local Fire De
partment who won- distinction during
the last year in battle to save human
lives from the flames were decorated
yesterday with the Scannell medal as
a reward for their bravery. August
Engelke and Claude Brownell were
the men thus honored, and, though
each was equally heroic, the fact that
Engelke risked his own life to save
a little child aroused greater sentiment
in his favor and In addition to the
Scannell medal he was presented with
a gold badge by the California Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Chil
dren and a gold watch by Colonel A.
Andrews, proprietor of the Diamond
Palace.
The presentation ceremony took
place in the grand rotunda of the City
Hall, In which a handsomely decorated
platform had been erected. Mayor
Schmitz presided and the families and
friends of the firemen and those that
had been saved from death through
their bravery crowded the floors that
reach far up Into the deme to applaud
his eloquent tribute to the men that
hud been summoned to accept reward
for the faithful performance of their
duty.
Prior to the delivery of the address
by the Mayor a quartet, composed of
Michael and Fred Scanlan, James E.
Donahue and Robert Davis, sang a
song dedicated to the Fire Department
heroes, especially to those whose con
spicuous acts of bravery had won them
public recognition. \ The song con
cluded. Mayor Schmitz rose and said:
WISHES OP SCANXELL
We have gathered trere to-<Jay to carry out
the wishes of our latt respected Chief Scannell
of the Fire Department, who. In his will, de
vised *20f.0 for the tmrchas? of a medal each
J'e*Â»", to be conferred Â«r*onth* member of the
department, occluding the Chief Engineer, that
shall be considered tbÂ» most meritorious In
the Derfcrmar.1-- of his duty, including gal
lantry and BervJees In Â«avln* human life. And
hereafter when we gather here it will be to
still frrther honor these brave nv?n, for I am
Jn ret-elpt of e. letter In which the news Is
contained that Raphael Welll, a public spirited
citizen of this city, -has placed a check for
12000 In the hands of thÂ« Fire Department with
Instructions that it shall- be Invested, as Is
the bequest of. the late Chief Scannc!l. and
that from the income a' medal, to be known
aÂ» the "Halllvan medial," after our present
efficient chief, shall be purchased each year
for presentation to some hero of the force of
fire flshters. , .
I hav* often thought of what it is that makes
the Fire Department of San Francisco superior
to that of. any other dly on the globe, but I
think you will aeree with .me when I say
that It Is because tt is made up of men of
courage and ability and because Us chieftain.
Mr. Sulllran. not only holds the respect and
love cf his men. but because. In addition, ho
holds the respect and love and has. the sup
port cf every cltlien oj San Francisco. Ht
never orders his men to precede him Into
places of damrer; he always tells them. to fol
low li!m and he will show them the way.
And lilÂ« courageous spirit inspires every man
of the deDartmest and such men cannot fall
to distinguish the branch of municipal service
they represent.
But I now -want to call upon Claude Brown
ell.-driver of engine company -17, to step for
ward that I may present to him the Scannell
med&l, which always stands for bravery, but
before placing It In his hands I want to tell
you of hi* act that has won for him this dis
tinction. â¢-
Brownell drove with his engine up to the
fir* which wit In the Unwood Hotel at IS,
Mason street, and quickly discovered a man
clinging to the window ledre of a fifth story
window cei the side of the building. To Jump
would have been certain death and It was
Impossible for him to co back Into the room
o& account of fire there. The window beinar
situated en the side of the building be could

tion. He secured a life line from his engine,
made his way ur> to the roof of the burning
building by means of the fire escape in front.
and crossinr over a tin roof, which had no
support but the tin Itself, the wooden frame
having been burned, away, he made, his way
to the fire wall and threw one end of his life
line to the man on the window ledge, who
was new almost enveloped in flames, and with
the aid of four oth?r firemen who had come to
his assistance In the meantime, drew the man
from his dangerous position on the window
ledge to a :>lace of safety.
MEDAL STANDS FOR BRAVERY.
"And," said the Mayor in conclusion,
turning to Brownell, "I take great
pleasure in presenting this badge to
you, because it always stands for brav
ery and you have bravely won it."
"I have only done my duty." said
Brownell, "but I wish to thank you
and all for the honor you have con
ferred upon me, and assure you that I
will endeavor to continue to do my
duty as I find It and bend every ef
fort to uphold the good name of the
department."'
Brownell was heartily cheered when
he took his seat.
"And now I want to tell you the
story of the heroism of August En
gelke." said Mayor Schmitz, "and I
know it is a story you all will ap
plaud." Continuing, the Mayor said:
At fc:40 o'clock a. m.. Jun* 11. 1001. August
Engelke responded with hlÂ« company, to an
alanr of fire. The fire was in a four-story
frame bulMinr at 29 Vandewater street. Upon
arriving at the scc-ne of the fire Kngelk* was
Inform<.-d that there was a small child locked
In one of the rooms on the third floor of tho
budding, it belnj the practice of Us parents
to lock It In raid room during thÂ« daytime
â while absent at their dally vocations. â 
Engejke ru*hed through the burning hall
way and reached- the door of the room in
which the child was. Finding the door locked
end unable to rain an entrance therefrom, he
broke dcr.-n the door of the adjoining room
and climbed out on the window ledge. He
crawled .-long the narrow ledge and, swung
himself to Uie Ifdge of ths window of the
room In which the child was and, entering
the room, rescued the ch!!d. Engelke's face
and hands were badly scorched and burned In
passing through the burning hallway. The
nara? of the child was Laurie llassa, a boy
about thrre and a half years old.
Turning to Engelke -the Mayor said
that as an example of ready and quick
wit and sterling courage Engelke' s act
in saving little Laurie Massa could
not be surpassed, and it was with plea
sure that he presented to him the Scan
nell medal.
EXGEL.KE IS CHEERED.
"I hope," said Engelke, as the medal
was pinned on his breast, "that my con
duct in the future ..will merit your ap
probation as It has i in - the past, and
after thanking you I will wish you all
a Merry Christmas and a Happy New
Year.". % . . .
Engelke was roundly cheered, but he
was not permitted to take his seat.
Fire Commissioner Boyne stepped
forward and- after, commending his
brave act presented to Engelke; ori be
half of the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Children, a gold badge
and voiced the regret of President
Newhall of the society that he â  could
not be present in person to reward En
gelke for his heroic act. -Then, on be
half of Colonel , Andrews of the Dia
mond Palace, Fire Commissioner Parry
presented Engelke^ with" a handsome
gold w"atch, I which bears l the following
Inscription: ; "Colpnel - A, Andrews to
August Engelke, noseman, for bravery
in rescuing a little boy from flames at
the risk of ; his life, June 11, 1904.';: .
Julius Kahn, , who . was present, "was
called upon to address the" gathering.
He said the heroes that ; had been hon
ored needed no encomiums from him;
their acts speak for themselves; but
in conclusion he said he would send
some books from the Congressional Li
brary at Washington to every flre
house in San Franciscoâ books that
would furnish a nucleus for a good,
substantial library.
Mayor Schmitz again spoke briefly
in conclusion, saying that such heroes
as the men of the Fire Department
deserved more consideration at the
hands of the people and instead of but
three days off a month, he was going
to see if he could not get each man of
the department a. full day off each
week, and also to get for them other
concessions that would make their
lives more agreeable.
The Mayor's announcement was
greeted with great applause. The ap
plause marked the end of the cere
monies and the fire laddies returned to
their houses to wait for danger to
again confront them. â¢

NAN PATTERSON
CASE IS CLOSED
Jurors Will To-Day Pass
Upoil Guilt or Inno
cence of Accused Woman
FINAL ARGUMENTS MADE
Eloquent Plea for Acquit
tal Is Answered With
a Scathing Arraignment
. NEW YORK, Dec. 21.â Judge Vernon
M. Davis did not deliver his charge to
the jury in the trial of "Nan" Patter
son, the former actress, to-night, but
sent the jurors home to rest after a
day spent in listening to the arguments
of counsel. It had been expected that
the case would go to the Jury before 6
o'clock, but Judge Davis put his charge
over until to-morrow.
Abraham Levyi chief counsel for the
defendant, occupied the time of the
morning session with his argument and
Assistant District Attorney Rand took
up the afternoon with his speech. Both
addresses were impassioned and elo
quent. Levy brought his listeners to
tears at times by his references to his
client and the homecoming in Wash
ington which he looked for.
PLEADS FOR IDS CLIENT.
Placing a Bible on the railing in
front of the jurors. Levy read the
eighth chapter of the Gospel of St.
John. He laid particular emphasis on
the sentence, "He that is without sin
among you, let him cast the first
stone," and then he said to the jurors:
"Will you say to her who sits before
you here, in the words of Him who
spoke at that time: 'Woman, go and
sin no more'?
"With the happiness of your own
home, before you and with the joy of
the Christmas festival in anticipation,
are you going to condemn this young
woman?
"Do not send her to her doom now
when the entire world is rejoicing. She
sits abandoned by all except that oia
man, her aged father. I leave her in
your hands, confident that you will ac
quit her and restore her to her devoted
old father at a time when everything
proclaims peace on earth and good will
to men. I ask that you allow her to
take him home to the aged wife and
mother who awaits them and give her
a chance to live a new life with them
in her home."
Levy impressed upon the jury the
fact that Miss Patterson was riot be
ing tried for immorality. No woman
became bad because of innate deprav
ity, he said. She became bad because
of the incentives of man and the weak
ness of <her nature. If a man took his
life because of love of her. why punish
her?'
"You cannot bring back the dead."
said Levy, "but if Caesar Younsr were
here to-day I think he would speak a
few Words for this poor Kirl he has
made his plaything."
RANDS PITILESS ARRAIGNMENT.
Rand's argument was a severe ar
raignment of Miss Patterson, a'nd when
the prosecutor pitilessly condemned
the woman as the murderer of the
bookmaker. Caesar Young, she galled
under his invective.
: "Actress, stony-hearted. cruel
mouthed avenger that she is.' the storv
she told, the manner of telling it. ought
riot tolie convincing to a child." he
said. ' "Every action proclaims guilt.
I have never seen a real murderer who
has not been distinguished by coolness,
calmness and unruffled demeanor and
conceit. T. never yet have seen a mur
derer who was not anxious to testify,
believing that his story could prove
convincing to the jury."
In -detail he held her character to
the 'jury and asked if a woman like
her was fit to have any love other
than that of the "beast."
"The beast in the woman called to
the beast in the man and the beast in
the man answered," he said.
. Miss Patterson's counsel were not
spared by Rand, who, after savins
that the defendant's testimony had
been typewritten and learned bv heart,
added:
I '"There are those among her defenders
who are capable of preparing testimony
which- they know to be false. I name
no names and I stand ready to prove
what: I say if there Is any question
raised on that statement."
i J. Morgan Smith and hia wife were
denounced by the lawyer.
SKELETON AGAIN USED.
Most impressive was Rand's attempt
to show, the jury that Young could
not have shot himself. The skeleton
which had already appeared during
the. trial. was brought forward and the
attorney, went over the details of the
entrance of the bullet and the direction
it took after entering Young's body.

During this recital Miss Patterson cov
ered her face with her gloved hands.
Rand used the revolver with which
Young was killed to prove that In no
position could It have been held by
Young to inflict the wound that caused
death. Facing the jury, with the pis
tol in his outstretched hand, the prose
cutor exclaimed:
"Gentlemen. I will give you this re
volver to take Into the jury room and
if any man among you can hold It as
the defense's theory of suicide would
require you to hold It in order to in
flict this wound and then pull the trig
ger. I will consent to your setting this
defendant free on the spot."
After Rand's speech. Levy said:
"That was the most wonderful ad
vocacy of any cause, the most master
ful speech that I have ever heard in a
criminal case in the courts for twenty
five years. In spite of that, I am con
fident that Miss Patterson will be ac
quitted." .

FOUR DAYS IN NILES;
HOW MANY IN JAIL?
"Doctor" Proctor's Excuses
OAKLAND. Dec. 2Lâ "Dr." WUliani
S. "Ptocxot shot across the firmament
cf Washington To^mship in Aiameda
County with a briniancy equaled only
by the flight of a meteor. It took him
only four days to land at Niies, seil a
lot cf eyerlassea, raise a lot cf money
and diamonds, promise marriage to aa
aged and highly respected widow, near
ly get lynched and finally land in the
Oakland jail with a charge cf felony
against him. The chronology of his
ccreer reads like this:
Saturday. T>tc 17.â He landi in Niles
with a young man claiming to be his
son, meets a Mrs. Emily Tyson, sold
her a pair of glasses.
Sunday. Dec 18.â Calls upon Mrs.
Emily Tyson and borrows J10S on a bill
of saJe for an automobile.
Monday. Dec- 15.â Calls upon Mrs.
Tyaoa again and gets possession of a
lot of her diamonds, promises marriage
and wants to trade a house and lot in
Oakland and a 2C#-acre orange ranch
in Los Angeles County for the famous
Tyson fruit ranch.
Tuesday. Dec 20. â Wants to buy sev
eral thousands of trees from the Cali
fornia. Nursery Company In. order to
ctock his ranch, is arrested ar.l a mob
threatens to lynch him if he does not
give uj> the money and diamonds. Is
landed in the Oakland jalL
SOME "FRENZIED FINANCE."
Even in this rapid age of frenzied
finance Thomas W. Lawson would be
compelled to admit that the only bit
cf modern slang that would cover this
case would be "that was going some."
The "doctor" dropped quietly into
Nile* on Saturday lasL His coming
was unostentatious and unnoticed. In
etriking contrast with his leaving. He
called at several places, purchased a
few qu'et drinks and asked about elder
ly and wealthy widows In the neigh
borhood. In some way he secured the
name of Mrs. Emily Tyson, who lives
a couple of miles outside of Niles. Mrs.
Tyson is one who Is respected through
out the entire township. She came to
that section in 1S5! with her husband
and is practically the oldest living
settler in that section and is nearly
eighty years of age. She is the pos
sessor of one of the finest fruit rancnes
of that section and a family of healthy,
hearty, strong- limbed sons, who are
guarding and caring for their mother
in her declining years. The family
wealth can "be counted to upward of
a hundred thousand dollars and no
one. ever goes away from their door
hungry.
Having acquired â  this Information
"Doctor" Proctor . hired a bueey and
drove out to see Mrs. Tyson. He in
ferred that in the afternoon the big
eons would be out looking after their
ranch interests, and be found Mrs. Tr-
Eon at home. He commenced the con
versation by offering to sell her a J 1 5
pair of gold glasses for J5. The day
was cold, and, with her characteristic
hospitality, she invited him- into the
warm house while the trade was con
cluded. He showed her a valuable Dair
cf glasses. - but when the deal was
made he palmed the good pair and
substituted - a pair which Mrs. Tyson
says is not worth a dollar. This, how
ever, was not discovered until later.
That was a fortunate start and the
next day he called again, it was a cold
day. also, and fa* had a young man
in bis bujrry who he said was his
eon- Both were Invited into the house
and they told of owning a .magnificent
bouse and lot in Oakland, and to Drove
thÂ«* ownership they showed a set of

house keys. The "doctor" also said
tha.t he had a 2W-acre orange zrove
near Los Angeles. and that he did
not like Oakland and wanted to eo
back to Los Angeles. He was (about
to trade his Oakland property for an
other cranes grove, but. unfortunately,
he a little "shy" on the trade and
h- needed about tlLO. In return for
this TL3) he had a VS.'Yt automobile that
he was wilifng to give as security for
the amount, and he would repay the
loan on January 15.
DOLLARS IX CORXERS.
The "doctor" was such a nice man
and llrs. Tyson did not want to see
him lose the trade fcr the want of such
a Email sum of money that she finally
dug up from odd corners of the house
a cbedc on the Bank of Alvarado and
enough cash to make up JI'j*. This he
assured her vrould do, and he made
cut a bill of sale, describing the auto
mobile in Its stable in Oakland.
ilonday he calied upon Mrs. Tyson
again and skillfully brought the conver
sation around to jewelry. He had a
ring or two that he exhibited, and she
brought oct some jewelry to show him.
Then he told her that he thought that
life on a Washington Township fruit
farm was preferable to that on a Los
Angeles orange grove; he told her
that he did not drink or smoke and that
she was ail that he loved In the world.
In the midst of all cf the flurry and ex
citement he talked off with the rines
and drove away with his so-called
"son."'
The next day the "doctor" called at
the California Nursery Company at
XCes and wanted to buy thousands of
trees, with which to stock his Southern
California ranch, meanwhile waiting
for a train tc take him out v* town.
But whiie the 'doctor" was waiting
for an opportunity to get away the
stalwart sons of Mrs. Tyson heard of
what was going on, and en masse they
went to Xiles to find the mar. with the
professional handle to his name. They
located him and took him vitb. his
â¢"son" to the XHes Hotel, where they
held them awaiting the arrival cf a
constable. The "doctor" at first show
ed f ght and some one shouted that he
had a pistol. Two of the Tyson boys
proceeded to take all of the fight out cf
him, despite his threats, and the other
two handled the younger man. *
Meanwhile word had gone out around
about the incident, and fully 200 people
gathered around the hoteL All of them
kr.ew the Tysons and respected them
all, particularly Mrs. Tyson,* with her
weight of eighty years. When the "doc
tor" ' showed fight open threats of
lynching were made, but everything
quieted down when Mrs. Tyson swore
to a warrant charging him with felony
and Constable Rodriguez brought them
to Oakland.
THE DOCTOR'S EXCUSE.
The Tysons do not discuss the mat
ter other than to say that Proctor took
advantage of their mother, who Is old
and of a trusting nature. On the other
hand. Proctor, has stopped talking en
tirely. He remains in his cell and re
fuses to say mere than he did last nirht
to The CalL Proctor trill be taken to
Centerville, before Justice Sandholt. for
arraignment to-morrow. He has em
ployed Tom Bradley as his attorney
and proposes to make a fight. He takes
refuge behind the statement that it was
ail a business transaction.
But whether business or not, during
the fight in the hotel at NHes the "doc
tor" turned over less than $89. all that
he had left of the J10S that he got from
Mrs. Tyson, and the younger man gave
back the rings. The taking of tfie dia
monds Js accounted for by the "doctor"
saying that Mrs. Tyson wanted him to
have them reset.
The boy who passed aa the "doctor's"
son at the Tyson home dow gives th*
name of Ray AFhberry and claims that
he was not a party to the four days of
"frenzied finance" In Niks..

protest against continued warfare. But
if the forces allied with the Christian
church were to array themselves
against the present practices and direct
their efforts toward converting the
pleasing theory of i&iversal p?ace into
a reality, even though complete success
should not crown their endeavors, there
is no question as to the beneficial re

charged with robbing the Placer Coun

at least tea pounds since his incarcera

Weber spends his time reading the
testimony presented at the preliminary
hearing and before the Grand Jury.
Last Monday his attorneys made appli
cation to the court for 5600 a month
family allowance. As Weber is only
twenty years old, this would mean
$7200 that his guardian and attorneys
would have the handling of before he
became of age.

the officers to-night.
"Will I be tried on all four of the
murder charges and for the bank rob
bery too?" he asked.
"Yes if you are cot hanged on the
first charge," replied the offlcer.
"It looks as though I will not have
much of an estate left, even if I do
finally get clear. The lawyers will have
it all." he remarked.

MORE CHADWICK
PAPERS MISSING
Small Satchel Follows the
Trunk and Grip That
Have Dropped From View
CLEVELAND, Dec. 21.â Still another
sctchel. one thought by Receiver Loe
&er to contain valuables belonging to
Mrs. Chadwick. was to-day found to
be missing. This developed in an ex-
amination of Mrs. Mary Londraville,
Mrs- Chadwick's former housekeeper,
before Referee in Bankruptcy Reming
ton. The discovery is in addition to
the missing trunk and grip that dis
appeared from the Holland House in
New York the day before Mrs. Chad
wick was arrested.
Mrs. Londraville told of having ac
companied Mrs. Chadwick to the Hol
lenden Hotel here at the latter's re-
Quest and of having taken two satchels
into a room. Judge Albaugh of Canton
and several men, the witness said, were
present in an adjoining room. She
heard no conversation. Asked as to
what had become of the satchels the
witness replied: '
"I "was instructed to give the large
me to D. L. Pine of this city. I called
him up by telephone and told him
about it and asked him to come for it.
He arrived after Mrs. Chadwick had
left for New York and I gave It to
him."
The satchel, she said, contained let
ters and papers. She did not know
what had become of the other satchel.
When the hearing was resumed this
afternoon Pine was present. He ad
mitted that he took the satchel and
kept it until Emil Hoover, Mrs. Chad
wick's son, called for it lasfSunday
night. Emil told him that his mother's
attorney, J- P. Dawley, wanted it. He
said he was not curious as to what
the satchel contained, but thought
there were papers in it.
Receiver Loeser said he would ask
tht attorney to reveal the contents of
the satchel. The hearing was then con
tinued until Friday morning.

ST. LOUIS, Dec. 21.â An incoming
Mobile and Ohio passenger train was
to-day stalled In the tunnel under the
downtown business section leading: to
Union Station as the result of an acci
dent that derailed the tender of the
engine. Nobody was injured, but the
paEser.geri and train crew suffered
from the clouds of smoke and gas
from the locomotive before the cars
could be taken out
The effect of the tender plowing
along the floor of the tunnel was simi
lar to that of an earthquake and many
persons in the big" buildings along
Eighth street, from St Charles to
Olive, fled to the streets.

physics at the Yerkes Observatory.
Plans for the establishment of a solar
r-observatory have been under consider
| ation by the trustees of the Carnegie
I Institute since 1902. In that year Dr.
I S. P. Langley recommended that an
observatory be built on a high moun
tain for the purpose of determining
whether the sun's heat is perfectly
constant in amount or undergoes,
changes observed in the sun spots and
! other phenomena of the sun's surface,
i and for other research of a similar na
! ture.
It is the purpose of the solar observ
atory to increase the world's stock of
knowledge of the sun and to apply
this knowledge in a general study of
stellar evolution. It will bring into
use for the first time various new and
powerful instruments, applied under
the best atmospheric conditions. One of
these instruments, a fixed reflecting
telescope about 200 feel long, is nearly
ready for trial. Another giant tele
scope is also under course of construc
tion. Parts of this telescope will weigh
as much as five tons each, and it will
be a difficult problem to transport them
to the summit of Mount Wilson. ThÂ«
height of Mount Wilson is about 6000
feet.

FEDERAL JURY
INDICTS MAYS
Prominent Oregon Attorney
Is Charged With Complic
ity in the Land Frauds
ASSERTS HIS INNOCENCE
Accused Says That He Acted
as 'Piter's Legal Adviser
and Was Drawn Iuto Casei
PORTLAND, Dec. 2Lâ Franklin
Pierce Mays, one of the best known at- I
torneys In Oregon and a member of a
respectable pioneer family, was this j
morning indicted by the Federal Grand !
Jury now in session on the charge of j
conspiracy to defraud the Government- !
Mays says he simply acted as attorney i
for S. A. D. Puter, but there is no doubt !
that the strongest possible attempt will j
be made to bring him into the land I
fraud case much more closely. :
The lands with which Mays is con- {
nected. six quarter sections, lie in a'
township close to the famous "7-11"!
land on which McKinley, Watson and 1
Puter were recently tried and convicted J
of fraud. Puter, it is said, told Mays!
that no claims in that township had J
been filed. If patents could be obtain- J
ed the land could be profitably sold. !
Puter agreed to furnish the necessary !
names of supposed settlers and Mays j
was to get the patents, Puter putting !
up the money. It is here that Senator i
Mitchell and Representative Hermann |
are brought into the case. A letftr j
from Mays to Mitcheil introduced Puter
to the Senator and Mitchell introduced
Puter to Hermann. i
After these six claims had been put I
through the Eugene land office through j
the influence of, Marie Ware, then
United States Commissioner. Mays, it
is said, tried to induce Miss 'Ware to
run eight more through. Miss Ware
became frightened and wrote to Horace
McKinley for instructions. He told her
to refuse Mays, who then became
angry.
The indictment of Mays has been
talked of for several days and it is
said it has great bearing upon the con
nection of Senator Mitchell and Repre
sentative Hermann with the great land
frauds. Mitchell is now hurrying from
Washington to Portland.
Extraordinary precautions are being
taken by the Government to prevent
any attempt to bribe the members of
the Grand Jury. Many secret service
men are in the city and a close watch
is being kept on the jurymen.

MURDER STILL
DEEP MYSTERY
No Light Shed on the Iden
tity of the Girl Found
Dead on Top of
COLORADO SPRINGS. Colo.. Dec.
21. â The police are as far from a clew
to the solution of the Cutler Mountain
mystery as ever, but their efforts are
beins redoubled.
The last clew that was in their hands
played out this morning when Ona D.
Hoyt, a pretty hairdresser, living in
this city, and who was reported to have
disappeared, was found safe at her
room in the Clinton Hotel.
The Coroner has in his possession no
less than forty hairpins that were
taken out of the coil of hair that re
mains on the head of the dead girl or
picked up at the scene of the attempted ';
cremation of the body. These hairpins j
are all of stiff wire, there being no j
small flexible ones and the number and
strength of the pins are taken to in
dicate that the growth of hair was un
usually heavy.
An increased number of officers is to
day engaged in the search through the
hills for evidence that may lead to the
discovery of the identity of the mur
dered girl or' of her slayer.
At their meeting to-day the County
Commissioners offered a reward of
$1000 for the arrest and conviction of
the murderer. -
Coroner Law burled the remains of
the girl to-day in Evergreen Cemetery,
in a lot provided by the county. The
body was put in a coffin and the latter
encased in a box, the County Commis
sioners offering to defray the expenses
of a decent burial for the girl rather
than permit her to be buried in the
grave of a pauper. â¢

FEDERAL IRRIGATION.
THE National Irrigation Association, which seems to be an alias
for Mr. Maxwell, is largely in evidence in an attack on Senator
Hansbrough of North Dakota, one of the authors and promo
tors of the Federal irrigation law. .Mr. Maxwell in his incorporated
capacity has memorialized Congress in a general attack on the
Senator, and belabors him with the same fervor he used in attack
ing the Modesto and Turlock districts in this State, to prevent their
completion of one of the finest irrigation plants in the world, which
is now fertilizing a quarter of a million acres of land.
The Federal irrigation fund now amounts to about $30,000,000.
it is lu be hoped that it will not come to be considered a companion
pork barrel to the river and harbor bill. It is growing at the rate
Â«Â»f $3,000,000 a year by the sales of the public land. Mr. Maxwell has
:ried hard to stop this increment by lobbying for repeal of existing
land laws, under which alone does the irrigation fund get additions
id its volume. Senator Hansbrough seems to favor not only the
enlargement of the fund, but its conservation, by putting its ex
penditure under proper official and professional supervision. To do
this he has proposed that a supervising engineer be appointed by
\he President, who under direction of the Interior Department shall
have general supervision and direction of the engineering work re
<mired by the law.
At present this task is assigned to an employe of the Geological
Survey, who has neither the time for the work nor the compensation
10 justify his giving the attention it needs.. It is easy to foresee
that under such circumstances the fund will begin to spring leaks.
The Government has a military engineer in chief, who has super
vision of the large -expenditures made under the engineer corps of
the army. That system deposits authority and responsibility in one
place. The authority is ample as the responsibility requires, and
the effect is to protect the public funds. It is doubtful if authority
and responsibility can be found hand in hand anywhere in the
administration of the. Federal irrigation law. Each work now in
progress seems quite independent of any relation to any other
work, and if there be any connection between them it is through a
subaltern of a subordinate of the Interior Department.
We submit that a work as great as this, presenting as many
complexities, and implying such ultimate risks to the national treas
ury, was never before left as slipshod in respect to oversight and
exactness in administration. Government, of necessity, does such
things wastefully and therefore there are safeguards, audits, coun
tersigns and all sorts of riffles established by law to catch things as
they flow and reduce to the minimum the inevitable waste. To say
that this stupendous experiment and enormous expenditure of money
shall go on under the normal conditions of Government waste, with
out the safeguards proved necessary by experience, is to utter folly
of the flathead brand.
It is not proposed to disturb in any way the present corps of
construction engineers, nor to revise or cancel existing contracts, or
in any way check the.progress of work now under way. But it is
proposed to put it alKunder the direction of a supervising engineer
of the highest qualifications, equal to those of the chief engineer of
the army, in whose office and under whose eye every plan made,
contract let, dollar expended, shovel of dirt moved and drop of
water impounded shall be focused.
Those who are to occupy the lands irrigated and pay back the
expenditures of the Government have rights in the matter and the
most at stake. It is already known that the cost of works under way
will be $20 for every acre irrigated. That has to be paid back by
ihe man who occupies the land. When it is known that the cost
per acre of the irrigation plant in the Modesto and Turlock districts
is $10 per acre, the interest of the land holder looms largely. The
Modesto and Turlock plant was not a Government enterprise, and
economy and efficiency went together in its construction. One may
easily see that it would be a blessing to the future landholders in
the Federal irrigation districts if the burden per acre could be as
low. It may not make any difference to Mr. Maxwell, \\vho is not
going to farm any of that land, but will gratify his agricultural heart
by farming the farmers, but it does make a great difference to a
tiller of the soil whether the Government mortgage on his land is
$10 an acre or $20. He has to take 'the risk of frost and wind and
weather, equip his land with buildings, teams and implements, sup
port his family and pay off a mortgage of $20 an acre in a limited
time. Farmers read this who have undertaken such jobs and they
wince at the recollection. Senator Hansbrough seems to be ac
cused of entertaining the malign purpose of making the mortgage
as light as possible. Whereupon the National Irrigation Association
is incensed and calls names and is afraid !
That association in its corporeal form, which preceded its cor
porate form, as the abalone precedes its shell, undertook for a
salary of $30,000 a year paid by the Western railroads to get ap
propriations for irrigation direct from the treasury. When Senator
Hansbrough proposed to derive the fund from the sale of the public
land the corporeal part of the association fought it. Finding it
would pass, the abalone acquired its shell by incorporation, in which
form it claimed a caveat on all plans for irrigation. There is a
suspicion now that it desires to stop accretions to the irrigation fund
and to use a bungstarter on what is already in the barrel, in order
to make good its contract to get direct appropriations. We shall see.
NO surprise can be occasioned by the news that Czar Nicholas
has decided that the interests of his empire cannot be ad
vanced by granting the national constitution and assembly
prayed for by the recently adjourned assembly of the Zemstvos'
Though dispatches from St. Petersburg give assurances that the
Czar is contemplating' granting a programme of reform, it is stated
with positiveness that this programme contains nothing so unheard
of as the toleration of an assembly of the people or a constitution for
the people.
The nature of this munificent concession which is to be made
to the desires of the people can be well guessed at after a review
vi former beneficent reforms that have sprung from the throne at
St. Petersburg. Probably it will provide that in case of bread riots
the knout may be supplanted by imprisonment for offenders; that
Tews may celebrate the Passover without fear of receiving any more
serious harm from local police than the breaking of their windows and
the insulting of their rabbis ; that army conscription will be waived
in the cases of all those bringing testimony to show that no less
than ten individuals are dependent upon them for support. It is
just possible that students will be allowed to choose their own uni
versity instead of being forced to attend the institution of their dis
trict. It is even within the bounds of probability that peasants may
have a hand in the disposition of local revenues.
Aside 'from these hypothetical reforms the wheels of Nicholas'
Government will assuredly find no hindrance to their grinding.
Mounted police will ever be ready to ride down on the crowd that
gathers to give sanction to a popular appeal. Bureaus and bureau
crats, installed in high places, will continues to conspire together, for
the maintenance of the close corporation on freedom and liberty
inviolate from the touch of the festering common people. The peas
ant remains a peasant; the aristocrat an aristocrat. And still Holy
Russia at the behest of her Czar fights the heathen Japanese as the
champion of Christendom. <
Some of the .States of the South have been seeding to attract white
laborers, but with little success. Although many of the Immigrants to the
ITnited States come from southern .countries and the South ought, to attract
them, yet the better'' class of them desire educational facilities for their
children and the assurance of equal opportunities with natives for getting on
in life and becoming citizens, conditions that do not exist in the South to the
degree they do in the.Xorth and West It is not to be doubted that* the
treatment of the negroes and social and political condition?, as they are
renerslly represented In the South, act as a deterrent to industrial settlers in
that section. â Omaha Bee. .;

< self to look at her the second time,
I though she was unconscious of his

i and there he had come to watch for
her.
The mother ar/d the beautiful sisters
never knew, any : more than they knew
her keen interest in the gloomy in
teriors visible from the elevated trains,
that their youngest was in the habit of
rushing through her shopping at the
high-class stores, where they had
credit, and then betaking herself pell
mell to a great Sixth-avenue depart
ment store, where, as she passed
through the revolving doors, she felt
with a shiver of delight that she
plunged into the stream of life.
The Jostling and crowding, the
teeming exhibits that overran counters
and were forever falling to the floor,
the near-silk, near-silver and near
gold commodities that filled the place
so lavishly, far from offending her
taste, stirred her fancy oddly, and she I
sauntered up and down the long aisles, j
alive with that suppressed excitement
that is one of the keenest emotions
life had to offer and indifferent to the
buffetings of the crowd which seemed
to her delightfully good-natured, if a
little lacking In form.
But the spot that she loved best
of all was the broad landing of the
marble stairaces that swirled grandly
upward from the center of the first
floor with a magnificence that was
dazzling even for a department store.
This landing formed a balcony, rich
with Oriental rugs and upholstered
furniture, and, most desirable of all,
it commanded a panoramic view of
the floor beneath.

The man â he was an artist and he
haunted the balcony o"n the lookout
for types â had noticed that she usual
ly came, out of her absorbed contem
plation of the scene below her with a
start, glanced in a dazed way at the
bold-faced clock near by and then fair

her absence since 9:30 by the pur

But the studies of her face and head
in his small sketchbook multiplied
and the oftener he drew her the more
dissatisfied he became. Always he
just missed catching the spirit of her,
the youth, the interest, the ardor and
the innocence of her glance, of every
line and movement, for it seemed to
his artist's eye that she was a very
marvel of expression.
It was about this time that the pub
lishers for whom he did more or less
work sent him a book for illustration,
and as he read the manuscript it
seemed the very girl of the balcony
who had wandered into its pages. By
some strange fate the lines that he
selected as the pictorial points told
a tale. "She stood looking down at
the throng below her, breathless, ab

ing her, recognized that of the thou
sands-she was the one," was another,
and the pictures composed themselves
in his brain with a precision that
could not be gainsaid.
He had watched for her before with
dreamy pleasure. Now his Watching
became eager, intense. His fingers
itched to tell the story â tell it, as he
knew he could, as he had never told
a story before. Once, indeed, she had
glanced toward him with a rfute in
terrogation that went from his book
and pencil to his face. But he had
quickly feigned an absorption that
must have convinced â¢ her, for she
turned away and glanced toward him
no more. V. .
It was not until after the pictures
had gone from him, not until the ab
sorbing work of weeks was ended,
leaving his mind temporarily as blank
as a room denuded of its furniture,
that any doubt of what he had done
assailed him. Then, with some con- !
sternation he realized that the world â¢
is very full of people, a fact that for
the past weeks had escaped him en- |
tirely. He had thought of it as peo- <
pled exclusively like the Garden of
*Kden â simply herself and him. Now
a sudden consciousness that his story
lay in an open' book, for others as
well as her to read, made him trem
ble. It had seemed the only way to
bring her out of the vague atmos
phere and into the circle of known
things. Now, he wondered if his I
method were not too blatant â if it
would not make her shrink farther
back into the crowded outer circle,
and with a sort of miserable, hopeless
patience he awaited the appearance
of the book.
"Who is the girl?"
Kendry. an artist friend, was look
ing at the proofs and he scowled and
narrowed his eyes in an effort to re
call the face in the picture before
him. Then a light dawned and his
brow smoothed.
"I say, it's uncommonly like that
little King girl â the sister of the
beauties. I, didn't know that you
knew them."
The maker of the pictures shook
his head with well assumed indiffer
ence.
"Never heard of them. I think.
Where do they live?"
His voice didn't sound natural to
himself, but Kendry was absorbed in
the pictures and apparently did not
notice.
"Farville," he answered absently,
and the other took courage.
"That's a mere face in the crowd,"
he tossed oft! airily. "Found it in a
Sixth-avenue department store." Ken
dry showed his disbelief.
"If they/ have that sort in depart
ment stores," he observed, "I think
I'll go to one of them to get me a
wife." To which his listener had the
temerity to answer:- "Do you know,
the same thought has crossed my
mind."
The next post carried an advance
copy of the book to Miss Katherine
King, Farville, N. J. As she glanced
at the pictures she tingled with de
ligrht. The great, swirling river of life
had caught -her up at last, no longer
passing her by as if she were but a
part of its smiling shore. She swept
into her mother's room without cere
mony.
"Mamma," she said breathlessly, "I
must, . I really must go to town to
morrow for a day's shopping."
Something told her he would be
waiting! j

$5000 BUTTERFLY
Schoolboys and children of larger

the news that Lord Rothschild had
paid no less than $5000 for a butter
fly. Collections hitherto .regarded as
worth a few marbles or a top suddenly
assumed a value hitherto unknown.
, Inquiry at the entomological branch
of the British Museum considerably
dampened the prospects of a boom in
butterflies.
"It is extremely unlikely," said the
superintendent to our representative!
"The highest price ever yet given for
a butterfly was Â£16. That was paid
by the Hon. Walter Rothschiid and
was thought to be very high. â¢ Of
course. Lord Rothschild may have
given Â£1000 for the whole expenses of
the expedition to get this specimen,
but I should say it was highly im
probable." â London Daily News.

Editor The San Francisco Call,
San Francisco.
Dear Sir:
I have noticed that The San Francisco Call
is offering as an inducement for new subscribers a
choice selection of roses, instead of the regulation
cheap chromos, or more or less useless trinkets;
The innovation ~ is to be highly commended.
Flowering plants improve and beautify the neigh
borhoods in which they are planted and add ma
terially to the brightest and best side of the lives of
those who learn to cultivate and love them.
I trust that The Call will extend its floral dis
tributing field to other classes of flowers.
With best wishes for the success of your cru
sade in behalf of culture and beauty, I am, .
Yours very truly,
EMORY E. SMITH,
President California State Floral Society.

SOME HOLIDAY VOLUMES PUBLISHERS OFFER
"The Greek Poets â an Anthology."
by Nathan Haskell Dole, is one of ihr
'best books of solid literature that thf
Christmas market affords. Thougr
most of ihe lovers of the classic pre
fer lo read their treasures in the
original Greek, to the many who have
not the command of dead tongues
translations offer the only avenue
back to the glories of the golden age
of letters. This anthology, ther.,
which embraces the best English
translations of every Greek poet
â whose work has stood the test of the
ages past, should fill an important
r.iche in the library of every broad
leader.
Mr. Dole has used careful discrim
ination in the choice of his transla
tions. In many instances he throws a
many-sided reflection upon the orig
inal poem by citing Quotations from
several standard translators. The
fourteen fragments of Sappho are
given in the various poetic concep
tions of such as Edwin Arnold, Dante
â¦iabriel Rosetti, Swinburne and Lord
Byron. For the Homeric poems
Chapman and Pope are, of course,
drawn upon heavily. Tennyson's trans
lations of fragments appear, Elizabeth
HarrerBrowning contributes and Wil
liam Maginn. discredited by some,
Iinds place. Under the head of Eurip
ides Shelley's "The Cyclops" and
Browning's "Alkestis" supplement the
translations of Gilbert Murray. Ed
ward Fitz-Gerald's "Oedipus at Co
lonos" furnishes the greatest material
for extracts from Sophocles.
"The Geek Poets" covers a wide
ia-nge and contains all that is of the
best in the classics of the Greeks. The
book is handsomely printed and
bound, suitable to the holiday season.

A holiday book that must find favor
with every one who has at home some
little folk to recall the days when life
was youngr and very fresh is "The Age
of Innocence" by "Walter , Russell.
Though many have been the books of
late that have sought to find the re
flection of childish joys and sorrows
and to mirror the soul of the little one
before the elders' fond eyes, no writer
has caught the spirit of the "age of
innocence" more aptly than this one.
"Remember the long, happy days of
summer before you ever dreamed of be
ing a grown-up? asks the author at the
very start; and before one has finished
the first chapter he remembers those
days as if they were yesterday and
the memory brings up something of a
longing â a half whispered wish that
those days might come again. But
best through Mr. Russell's eye can we
catch that vista of green woods, of
musty hay barns and flower dotted
meadows that lies behind somewhere.
To read of these things Is to envy all
little persons who are still cutting their
second teeth.
Since Mr. Russell Is as apt with the
brush as with the pen he has furnished
the illustrations for his own bookâ full
page miniatures of the most fascinat
ing children. They add greatly to the
book's worth.
(Dodd, Mead & Co., New York; illus
trated; price $2 00.)
"Flower Fables and Fancies" by N.
Hudson Moore is another attractive
holiday volume and one unique. In this
book the writer follows the course of
the various flowers through song and
story, recounting all of the legends
clustered about special blossoms and
detailing the part flowers have had to
play in the lives of many whom the
world has counted great. Mohammed
loved the violet, calling it "flower of
humility;" the lotus was the sacred
flower ordained by Buddha to be the
symbol of his authority on earth; a
red and a white rose once sank their
roots Into the best blood of England.
Thus are the significant histories of all
the common blossoms recited by the
author. Excellent illustrations from
photographs and artistic marginal dec
orations make the book a dainty gift.

A royal reception was given to Pad
erewski last night at the Alhambra,
The big theater was tested to its ca
pacity and the audience stormed with
applause when he - finished his pro
gramme* He was compelled to satisfy
three encores at the conclusion of his
work, finally ending with the "Min
uet," his own composition, which
made a deep Impression when he
played it during hls % previous visit
here.
The skill and feeling with which he
handled the works of the masters
seemed to hold the audience in en
chantment.
From the attendance and the recep
tion given to Paderewski last night it
Is evident that San Francisco holds a
warm spot for the talented virtuoso.
The following programme was given:

CHARITY BALL
AT ST. FRANCIS
IS BRILLIANT
By Sally Sharp.
A brilliant affair was the charity
ball at the St. Francis last night. But
why ( not, with the debonair Mr.
Greenway at the helm? Forsooth is he
a wonder at throwing a glad glamour
over functions that ofttlmes threaten
to hang heavy.
But the geniality of the ball last
night was not all of Mr. Greenway's
making â far from It, \ for a coterie of
kindly women have been lying awake
o' nights planning, for its success.
Among them are Mrs; Edgar F. Pres
ton, Mrs. George B. Sperry, Mrs. J. J
Spieker, Mrs. William Thomas, Mrs.
W. W. Van Arsdale, Miss Maud O'Con
nor, Miss Adelaide Pollock, Mrs- Homer
E. Osborne, Mrs. Jacob Bertz, Mrs. "W.
S. Leake, Mrs. Frank V. Wright, Mrs.
William U Gerstle, Mrs. J. J. The
obald, Mrs. Guy E. Manning, Mrs.

Mrs. Eugene Bresse, Mrs. O- B. Burns.
Mrs. Albert Dernham, Mrs. Henry
Dernham, Mrs. James Elder, Mrs. Her
bert E. Law and Mrs. A. H. Martin,
most of whom assisted in receiving the
hosts of men and women who thronged
the white and gold ballroom-
Sweet was the sentiment that brought
them together under the spell of music
and the danceâ 'twas not the mere love
of either, but the love for little children.
By the kindly efforts put forth last
night the San Francisco Nursery for
Homeless Children will be richer by
many shekels. And badly 'tis needed
for the maintenance of the beautiful
new home at Lake street and Four
teenth avenue, where more than a hun
dred little tykes â otherwise without the
dear shelter of home â are tenderly
cared for.
Blessings on the good women who
have made this home possible! And
blessings on the' red-cheeked tykes
who find beneath its hospitable roof
the one gift that God intended each
little soul should have..

NEW COMMITTEE
Nine Republicans Appointed
to Consider Party Measures
at Session of Legislature
LEGISLATORS LS T CITY
Holiday of Monday, January
Second, Will Not Preclude
Organization on That Day
The constitution of the State of Cali
fornia, Article IV, Section 2, provides
that the sessions of the Legislature
shall commence at IS o'clock m. on the
first Monday after the first day of Jan
uary. Monday, January 2, 190S, will
be observed generally as a legal holi
day, but It is understood that the Leg
islature will meet at noon on that day
and begin the work of organization.
It Is probable that both houses will
organize on that day, so that ballot-
Ing for the office of United States Sena
tor may begin on Tuesday, January
1O.> Failure on the part of either branch
of the Legislature to complete- its or
ganization on the first Monday of Jan
uary would postpone the initial bal
lot for Senator until Tuesday, January
17.
The Republican members of the As
sembly comprise more than a majority
of the two branches of the Legislature,
and this majority in joint convention
of the Senate and Assembly could. If
so minded, elect a Senator without the
assistance of the Senate.
The advisory body of the Republi
can State Central Committee at a Bes
sion recently held In this city author
ized General- George Stone, chairman
of the general organization, to appoint
a committee of nine on legislation. The
appointment of the following- Is an
nounced: Senator Thomas -H. Selvage,
Humboldt; Senator E. F. Woodward,
Sonoma; ex-Senator Robert T. Devlin,
Sacramento; John A. Britton, Alame
da; Lieutenant-Governor Alden Ander
son, Solano; W. 8. Wood, San Francis
co; Senator H. W. Lynch, San Luis
bispo, and L. A. Wright, Ban Diego.
General Stone, by virtue of the resolu
tion creating the committee. Is a mem-,
ber thereof.
It is understood that the committee
will deal only with legislation pertain
ing to political subjects, and will not
offer any suggestions whatever con
cerning the prerogative of the Legisla
ture in the election of a Senator of the
United States. In the Senatorial con
test of 1S99 a branch of the Republican
State Committee In the Golden Eagle
Hotel, Sacramento, was used quite
freely by the supporters of one of the
leading aspirants for I the office of
United States Senator, and such use
evoked considerable comment.
State Senators. Chester Rowell of
Fresno and Samuel H. Ratnbo of San
ta Cruz and Assemblyman W. D. L.
Held of Mendodno were In the city
yesterday. Colonel A. G. Gassen of
San Diego left the city for the south
yesterday. John Gaffey, the hope of
the Democratlo party In the southland,
is In town. W. F. X. Parker of Los
Angeles was in the city early this
week, on his return from a trip to
New York.
Souvenir of Golden Jubilee.
A beautiful souvenir book, entitled
"Oak Leaves," has been Issued in com
memoration of the fiftieth anniversary
or the founding of the Presentation

tains many historical and valuable
articles that will interest the reader

BIG FIGHT
STIRS UP MUCH DISCUSSION AMONG SPORTS
WHO END A LOT TO GOSSIP ABOUT IN THE AFTERMATH
THREE WINNERS FOR W. DAVIS
Ananias Leads From
Start to Finish
in Handicap.
Red Cross Nurse Is
Overlooked at
Long Odds.
BY F. E. MUUIOLIiAND.
TV. Davis cisplayed exceptionally
good form in the saddle at Oakland
yesterday, one of his three successful
mounts being on Ananias, winner of
the $1000 handicap at one and an eighth
miles.
Johnny Schorr's colt looked comfort
ably situated with 104 pounds to nego
tiate, and he won from start to finish,
ehowing Mike Daly's Elliott the way in
by three and a half lengths in 1:52
flat. The betting about the winner
around post time had lengthened to 16
to 5. Military Man. the favorite, fin
ished a dose third. Divina had quite
n following, which forced her price
down from 10 to 6. She acted sour at
the post, breaking half a dozen lengths
behind the others, and was not prom
inent.
THREE FAVORITES SCORE.
As the card had an attractive look,
it drew a large attendance, the betting
ring being crowded- Favorites held
their own, capturing three of the
purses. Baker and Red Cross Nurse
were the surprises, each dropping in at
long odds.
An "eagle bird" first rattle out of
the hox put the bookmakers in goqd
humor, especially those which "bump
ed" the two favorites. Golden Buck
and George P. HcXear. It was a Fu
turity course sprint for two-year-olds,
and the colts mentioned were each
quoted at S to 5. Golden Buck met with
poor racing luck, and when it looked
:ib if Bullinan would place McXear
over the line first Michaels brought
Baker, a 15 to 1 shot, from behind, win
ring by a length. Robert Mitchell led
to the stretch. â  -
Sad Sam attended a Christmas tree
recital in the five and a half furlong
run following. He met an inferior col
lection of platers and at scant odds
rolled in a couple of lengths before
Silent Water. Batidor, a 200 to 1 shot,
ran third.
Mimo, the favorite, was awarded a
nose decision over Troy at the finish of
the six and a half furlong event, with
a big cluster of thirteen going to the
post. Bronze Wing cut out the early
pace and then quit as usual in the
stretch. Davis, astride the first choice,
did some extra heavy booting the last
sixteenth and received the verdict over
Troy. It was a close thing. Bronze
Wing; managed to beat Sugden out of
the show.
DAVIS PILOTS THREE WINNERS.
Davis made it three straight by fin
ishing first in the mile selling fixture
on Red Cross Nurse, against which 9
to 1 was laid. The filly cut out the
running from the jump, winning with
out difficulty from The Lieutenant,
another outsider. Larsen, on Minda
nao, the 6 to 5 favorite, was third.
Mocorito received considerable support,
I rut her chances of getting inside the
money were ruined by McBride getting
the mare pocketed. Anvil and Budd
Wado cut no figure in the race.
Charley Henshall had a good-sized
bet down on his colt Head Dance to
win the final mile purse fixture for two
year-olds and Kunz got him to the
wire in front. Jenkins made the run
ning for nearly three-quarters of the
journey with Downpatrick, a 40 to 1
shot. It resolved down to a drive the
last part of it between Kunz on the
favorite and Bullman with the mount
on Ara. Head Dance stood the drive
gramest, scoring by half a length. Car
dinal Sarto found the route too far.
S TRACK XOTES.
Tweijty-flve bookmakers made the
weight again yesterday. Bob Lloyd
cut in under name of the Golden Gate
Club.
Walter Jennings^ released W. Davis
from his contract yesterday, as the
owner and the jockey could not agree
on matters pertaining to the stable.
Willie Harris said he would not al
low Davis to accept any mounts for
a time. The boy displayed good form
yesterday, and the former may change
his mind.
Red Cross Nurse, now owned by
Molera & Josephs, was bid up $400
over her entered selling' price of $600
by ; George Wentworth, former
trainer of the mare. She was retained
with the customary $5 bid.
Ed Galnes. a well-known Eastern
bookmaker, arrived from New York
Tuesday night.
The first. two-year-old race of the
coming year will be decided on Jan
uary 2. at Oakland.
The valuable stakes of the New
Memphis Jockey Club will close , on
January 2, 1906. Blanks may be ob
tained at Oakland from Harry Kuhl.
The association across the bay will
endeavor to arrange a special at a
mile, which will bring: together
Dainty, Honlton, Claude and one or
two other of the cracks. Of course
Garnet Ferguson's colt Bearcatcher
would be Included but for the fact
that the brown flyer's Illness has
placeH him on the retired list for a
spelL The association will hang up a
$1000 purse, idth $600 added If the
California record is broken, and $1000
more if the world's record should be
shattered, or $2500 in all.
Beginning with MJmo. W. Davis
landed three winners In a row. Red
Cross Nurse, one of them, reached
9 to 1 In the betting, it belns gener
ally supposed the mare was a mud
lark only.

cate which purchased the sloop De
troit and had it shipped from Lake
Michigan to this city to enter the
Lipton cup races last summer has
announced that the vessel will be-dis

STREET CAK TOSSES WAGON
AND HORSES INTO DITCH
Hnrry Ordway, the Amateur Fighter,
Badly Injured in the
Mixup.
Pierpont Ordway, generally known
as Harry Ordway, a well known ama
teur lighter, came within an ace of
winding up his earthly career yester
day. He was driving a team attached
to an express wagon up Ellis street
just east of Powell at 6:30 p. m.
yesterday when street car 1309, in
charge of Gripman Morton, ran into
the outfit.
Ordway; wagon, horses and all went
flying into the air and came down with
a crash into the excavation that is
being made along 4 V> north 'side: of
Ellis street at a point opposite Harry
Corbett's cafe. The struggling horses
kicked frantically and in the mixup
Ordway was hurt. It took about an
hour to extricate the outfit from its
position, during which time car traffic
in, that street .was, entirely suspended.
Ordway's injuries were painful â a kick
in the groin and 'â  a laceration of one
earâ but he declined to go to the* hospi
tal, preferring to stay by His team. .
Partners Fall Out.
Bart.no Hessel considers that he has
been misled and mistreatedby Ferdi
nand Jung and has sued for a dissolu
tion of their copartnership in the
Standard Bottling Company. , Hessel
alleges that they agreed on November
IS to go into business together, each
to contribute a half ; of the capital.
When the contract of partnership was
presented it provided that Hessel
should . put up $5000 and Jung $2500,
but I Hessel says was induced to
sign upon Jung's" explanation that the

BOXERS SHOW NO MARKS
AFTER DESPERATE FIGHT
Nelson Complains That the Referee Re
duced His Effectiveness bv His Actions.
After all their desperate fighting on
Tuesday night Jimmy Britt and Bat
tling Nelson were on the streets yes
terday, showing slight evidences of the
encounter through which they Wd
passed. Britt had a slight cut over his
left eye. which the majority of the
spectators at the fight thought was
caused by Nelson butting him with his
head. When Nelson's attention was
called to this injury he said he distinct
ly remembbered hitting Britt with his
right-hand and, that he hurt one of his
Knuckles when he delivered the blow.
Nelson was unmarked save for an un
natural pufflness about the hose. Britt
went to the matinee in the afternoon,
while Nelson strolled .about the sport-
Ing resorts discussing the fight with his
friends.
Nelson has had the experience of
many other bdxers who held out for a
particular referee i and then "thought
they were given the worst of^Jt. Nel
son ; is sure he- should have had no
worse than a draw decision, but it Js
not on this score that he feels the most
aggrieved. "Why dldnt Roche referee
this fight as he did my fight with Cor
bett?" asked Nelson. "In that fight he
let us go at it and made no attempt
either to pull us apart or to step be
tween us. On Tuesday night he gave
me the worst of all the breaks, and I
must have hit him forty times in my
efforts to reach Britt ,while he was in
my way. I think he should have dis
qualified Britt for hanging on. as the
Queensberry rules Btate explicitly that
a man must not hang on. If we had

POLICE MAKE RAID
ON BELDEN PLACE
Twenty-Six Women Are Taken Into
Custody by Captain Duke and
Ills Squad.
Captain of Police Duke took initial
steps last night toward the permanent
closing of Belden place, a notorious
alley running from Pine to Bush
street, between Kearny and Mont
gomery. Assisted by. Sergeant Shaw
and sixteen patrolmen in citizens'
clothesi he raided eight houses locat
ed on the thoroughfare and arrested
twenty-six women. All were taken to
the Central police station, where they
were charged with vagrancy.
When the women arrived at the
prison Duke announced to them that
it was the intention of the police to
close the alley and that the houses
could be rio longer. used for their pres
ent purposes. He stated that arrests
would be made nightly and urged the
women to seek other quarters. Soon
after the women were booked an at
tornf-; arrived at the Hall of Justice
and the prisoners were bailed out at
the rate of $25 apiece. Several other
attempts have been made to close the
place, but after each raid the police
were prevented from going further on
account of the issuing of injunctions.

VERMONT HILLS STRIPPED

of .these: trees have been cut in the

Throughout . the .'rest , of the . Green

NELSON* DISCUSSES REFEREE.
"It .was agreed upon and announced
that we would break at the order of the
referee.' The latter must have had a
different idea, as his first act was to
take off his coat, vest, collar and neck
tie, apparently prepared to struggle
with us. There never was a time during
theflght thatl was dazed or in any dan
ger of going out. In order to draw
Britt's fire I deliberately dropped my
hands, on a couple of occasions and
feigned grogginesa in order to tempt
him into mixing with me. The moment
I started to punch he went back to his
holding tactics and reduced my ef
fectivejiesp. Britt is not a hard hitter,
ns there was no steam In any of his
blows. As an evidence of this there
is not a sore spot on my body to-day."
The* friends of Britt saw many
chances he overlooked. He paid a lot
of attention to Nelson's head after he
found that the Dane could not be hurt
there. He had many chances to send
in a right to the heart, but he seemed
to overlook them entirely. lie worked
his way out of a % corner once in clever
style, but several times after that he
let Nelson corner him and did not try
to sidestep the Dane as he rushed in
head down. Britt fought from the
start like a man who had made up his
mind to stave off defeat by every
means in his power rather than take
a chanc" of scoring a decisive victory.
RECEIPTS ARE DECEPTIVE.

not come up to the expectations of the
fighters. Tha tickets when counted
thowed gross receipts of $26,900. Of this
the fighters' share was $14,795. Of this
Britt received SS877. while Nelson re
ceived $5918. The club's share was

nffair was about $2000, leaving a net
profit to the club of about $10,000.
The club managers are already figur
ing on fights for January and Febru
ary. The application of the San Fran

Britt does not want to fight next month
the Hayes Valley Club would like to
handle a fight with him as principal in
February.
Young Corbett's popularity with the
public was attested by the reception
given him in the ring on Tuesday night.
In view of a possible engagement he
will settle down to-day, probaBTy at

will go through a severe course of train
ing under the direction of Frank Mc-
Donald. He expects to work so hard
this time that he will bring himself
down to 1?R pounds, a notch he ha.i not
reached in many years. He figures
that the amount of work he will do to
bring himself to, that figure will put
him in condition to fight for his life.
He is willing to meet Britt or Nelson at
1"2 pounds, the weighing to be donÂ»

the Oceanic Steamship Company's
Uner Ventura, Captain Ha>T\*ard,

time lost in waiting will be made up
on the journey across the Pacific and
the Ventura's schedule will be in tune

This making up of time lost by the

Ventura and her sisters, â  Sonoma

Alameda and Mariposa carried the
mail bf-lvret-n here and the Antipodes

thai the run from here to Australia

itu- San Francisco-Sydney service has
!"Â«K been pointed out as the nearest

transportation. The Ventura and her
Fis-ters not only have kept faithfully
if their schedules in all kinds of
weather, but have done it when handi
capped by delays at this end caused by
lardy Atlantic liners and slower over
land trains. The service contributed
by these three boats is accepted all
over the world as the standard of per
fection in mail carrying and the one
line which never causes the postal au
ihoriiies a moment's worry.
Many prominent Australians will

; City Must Pay Debts.
ji Judge Hebbard yesterday declared
'from the bench that he could never
! understand why individuals should be
J required to pay their debts and the
I city and county evade them. There
i fore he decided that the city and
county should pay $2200 to twenty
one men who were employed as extras
in Tax Collector Smith's offlce during
the month of JMay. The suit was
brought by James A. Code, who, with
eighteen others, was employed as an
extra clerk in the office at a salary of
5100 a month, and at. the same time
an acting cashier and acting, searcher
were employed at $150. The city ad
mitted that -the men had been regu
larly employed, but pleaded -that ! the
$36,000 appropriated for %xtra help
in the tax office had been previously
expended.

POWDER TRUST
MAKES DENIALS
Says It Has Not Conspired
Nor Threatened to Wreck
Peyton Chemical Company
LOANS LARGE v SUMS
â  â  f -<--:â - .. â¢
Du Pont Affidavit Shows Ad
vances of Nearly a Half
Million for Local Plant
Thepowdor trust had its day in court
yesterday with a showing in refutation
of the charges of the Peyton . Chem
ical Company and in support of its
demand for an inspection of the books
before determining whether or not it
shall pay a $30,000 assessment upon its
shares of Peyton stock. The hearing,
before Judge Kerrigan, occupied all of
the day. It will be resumed on Friday
morning.
At the opening yesterday Attorney
E. S. Pillsbury asked for a continu
ance, which was denied. He said that
the California Powder Company, of
which he is practically the executive
head, had been Charged with being a
party to a conspiracy to wreck the
chemical company, and he wanted an
opportunity to deny the charge. The
president of the concern. Captain John
Birmingham, is now on his way from
Washington. Garret McEnerney, at
torney for the Du Pont Company in the
original litigation, also asked that he
be permitted to participate in the final
arguments. Both Pillsbury and Mc-
Enerney asking for delay pleaded that
they had been busy with the Dolbeer
case.
A half-dozen counter affidavits for
the E. I. Du Pont de Nemours Powder
Company were then read to the court,
the principal one being that of Pierre
S. Du Pont, treasurer and assistant
secretary of the big New Jer
sey corporation. He admitted the
company's purchase of. stock in
the various California powder com
panies, excepting the Judson Dyna
mite Company, but said that the pur
chases had been made in Delaware and
that the company had done no business
in this State. He denied that there had
been any conspiracy to wreck the
chemical company, but admitted that
a proposition hed been made to acquire
control of the local corporation, the Du
fonts believing that a change in man
agement would be for the best interests
of all the stockholders.
LOANED LARGE SUMS.
His recital of the financial transac
tions between W. C. Peyton and T. C.
Du Pont, president bf the trust, threw
&r. interesting light upon the relations
between the companies. He declared
that In January, 1901, Peyton represent
ed that $300,000 cash was all that was
needed to start the Peyton Chemical
Company, and upon his representations
the Du Ponts subscribed and paid for
$300,000 worth of stock. Du Poni ex
pressed the belief that the remainder
of the stock, 2500 shares, was issued to
Peyton without payment. Afterward,
it is said, Peyton represented that more
money was needed, and the Du Ponts
loaned him $75,000. and thereafter he
borrowed $75,000 more from the Bank
of California. In 1902, it is said, Pey
ton said $45,000 more was needed to
complete the works. He got that, and
returned for another loan of $60,000,
saying that it would not all be needed,
Â»5S the earnings would be sufficient to
meet part of the debt.
When the SfiO.000 loan was made, It
Is said, it was ugreed that there should
bÂ£s no more demands for money, and
the assessment of $10 a share on . the
Dil Ponts* 3000 shares is considered an
evasion of that agreement. The ex
planation of the California Powder
Company's breaking of the five-year
contract for acids, on which the Pey
ton Company has sued for $572,000 dam
ages, is trlven in the statement that
the Peyton Company failed for three
years to deliver any acid under the
contract.
CHANGE NECESSARY.
Du Pont says that the situation has
Kone from bad to worse, and it was
considered that a change of manage
ment was imperative, so it was ar
ranged to transfer part of thÂ«> Du Pont
stock to R. S. l'enniman of the Califor
nia Powder Company, in order that
he might inspect the books and get on
thÂ« boerd of directors. It is declared
ihat $4SO,000 of the Du Pont money has
been used up in three years, the inter
cat on which would amount to $60,000.
and there has been no return in the
way of profits. .
Other affidavits, chiefly those of F.
D Madison and P.. S. Penniman. went
into the qutstion of good faith in de
manding the transfer of stock and in
spection of the books and of the regu
larity of the litigation. Attorney J. J,
Barrett argued the Du Pont side and
Judge Allen spoke for the chemical
company. _
DESERTED BY SHIPBUILDER
ON DAY OF MARRIAGE
Nellie Cuhlll's Reason for Getting
Divorce â Author's Wife Given
Decree.
Nellie Cahill told Judge Kerrigan
yesterday that she had married Ed
ward Cahill. a shipbuilder, at San
Mateo on November 29 of last year
and that he had deserted her on the
same day. He had since refused to
accede to her demands for support
and upon this showing the court
granted her an interlocutory decree of
Irma B. Bolce, wife of Harold Bolce,
magazine writer and holder of a de
partment position in Washington,
convinced Judge Kerrigan that she
was entitled to a decree of separation
from the author on the ground of his
habitual intemperance. She testified"
that he had been addicted to excessive
drinking for three years pa-it.
Judge Hunt granted a divorce and
the custody of two children to Irene
M. L. Floyd, who charged Jefferson
Davis Floyd, owner of a restaurant on
California street/with cruelty. Other
divorces were granted by Judge Ker
rigan to Nevada C. Thornton from
Clarence W. Thornton, for neglect and
desertion: by Judge Hebbard to James
H. Eulcy from Mary E. Euley, cru- |
elty; by Judge Sloss. to William Birch |
from Minnie Birch, cruelty; by Judge
Graham to Mary Garrigan from Mich

vorce were filed by Annie Low Met-;
calf against Edward B. Metcalf. cru
elty; Johanna Hearne against Joseph
He'arne, cruelty, v i
. a dismissal of the suit of Bertha
Lavinburg against ' Samuel Lavinburg J
was filed yesterday. It is evident'that ;
the bondholder who, in the wisdom of
his seventy years, required his wife to
sign an agreement not to sue him for J
sfipport, has Induced her to return to |
him. â¢ â " . !

WANT TO P AVE
DIRTY STREETS
Board of Public Works
Anxious to Put an End
to Disgraceful Conditions
WOULD SELL THE BONDS
Orders City Architect to
Prepare Plans for Engine-
House on 26th Avenue
There is a possibility that the rap
idly degenerating streets of San Fran
cisco will at least be repaired to a
fractional extent in the near future.
The desire of tlm Board of Public
Works and the Board of Supervisors
is that some relief be afforded at the
earliest opportunity and that at least
a portion of the bond lssuÂ« for the re
paving of accepted streets be made
available. . The Board of. Public
Works has ordered a resolution pre
pared that requests that the Board of
Supervisors sell bonds in sufficient
sum to permit of the paving of prin
cipal streets designated in the report
of the City Engineer.
A gr^at deal of complaint haÂ« been
made by property owners of th<Â»'de*
cadence of the city streets and the
failure to sweep them. There la also
a failure on the part of the police to
enforce the ordinance prohibltliig the
sweeping of refnse of shops into the
gutters. The story is extant that
never in the history of the city hav9
the streets been in such a disgraceful
condition and that now is the time to
take steps to have them properly
cleaned and kept frÂ«e of health-pois
oning debris.
The streets that the Board of
Works proposes to repave with bitum
inous rock or asphalt on a concrete
foundation are: Market street, from
Second to East; Mission street, from
Fifth to Ninth; Sixth street, from
Market to Howard; Valencia street,
from Eighteenth to Twenty-sixth;
Sutter .street, from Stockton to Lar
kin; Kearny street, from California to
Montgomery avenue; Bush street,
from Powell to Taylor; Larkin street,
from Hayes to Turk; Van Ness ave
nue, from Fulton to Geary; Seventh
street, from Market to Harrison;
Ninth street, from Market to Folsora.
There are many streets in the down
town district proposed to be repaved
with basalt blocks on a concrete foun
dation and with basalt blocks on sand,
and these will also be improved, the
idea being to stimulate interest In the
purchase of the bonds.
It is proposed to deal similarly with
the construction of other streets, pro
vided for by the bond issue, it being
intended to proceed with those for
which there exists an immediate ne
cessity.
The board referred to President of
Board of Works Schmitz several pe
titions for permits to sell flowers In
the free markets at Kearny and Mar
ket streets. Schmitz stated that he
would prepare rules governing such
permits, among them being one pro
viding for the laying out of a certain
space for the market and requiring
baskets to be kent three feet apart.
The board decided to bituminlze
and Dut sidewalks down on , Scott
street, between Fulton and Hayes,
fronting Alamo square. The appropri
ation of $2750 is insufficient to improve
Hayes street in front of the park.
The contract for repaying Eleventh
street, between K and L, was awarded
to McHugh & Sheerln.
The City Architect was directed to
prepare plans for an engine-house on
Twenty-sixth avenue, near Point Lo
bos. The streets In the vicinity will
be improved 'if there are any funds
available.
The plans for a safety station at
Market and Powell streets were ap
proved and referred to the Supervis
ors, as it will cost $1400, and only
$750 was appropriated.
The Mutual Gas Company was re
quested to restore the pavements on
Market street which it tore up to lay
mains, the San Francisco Company
having secured an injunction prevent
ing the continuancÂ» of the work.
Olson Bros/ Failure.
There were no- new developments
In the Olson Bros.' and the Olson
Company's failure yesterday. The
creditors have taken charge of the af
fairs of the firms and it will be several
days before an inventory of the stock
will be taken. Business was continued
yesterday at the stores with which
the Olson brothers are associated.

FALSE REPORT OF HUSBAND'S
DEATH FATAL TO HIS WIFE
Although Separated From Him for
Three Years, the Shock Kills
Her.
NEW YORK, Dec. 21. â An un
founded report of the death of her
husband, from whom she had been
separated for three years, cost the
life of Mrs. Catherine Shaffer at her
home in Union Hill, N. J.. to-day.
Shaffer had" been ill with pneu
monia, but is recovering. A child of
the couple, who lived with the
mother, was told on the street that he
was dead. She ran home with the
news. The mother became hysterical,
passed from one convulsion to an

Opportunities for Dairymen.
Last year England- imported 219,000
tons of butter. The United States ex
ported about 4000 tons. These facts
leave a fair inference that England of
fers an open market for more than fifty
times as much butter as we are in the
habit of exporting. England's purchases
of this article from foreign countries
and from her colonies amount to about
$100,000,000 a year. Our export sales of
it approximate â¢$1,500,000. England pur
chased last year about '136,000 tons of
cheese. Our total exports were in the
vicinity of 8000 tons, worth about $2,v
250,000. Canada, whom we are prone to
regard as an economic inferior, export
ed ten times as much as we did. This
leaves a fair inference that there is in
England alone a possible market for
some $40,000,000 ' worth of cheese every
year. â New York Sun.

tention ward of the Central Emergency
Hospital. The attendants are looking
for the man who brought him there
last June. Smith arrived here on the
Sheridan June 35 from Manila, hound I
for his home In Ohio. The stranger !
notified the officials that Smith was not j
Just right and asked to have him cared '
for for a few days, when he would '
have him sent to his home. It has been |

has also $250 coming to him from the j

money.

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, Dec. LM. â The wneat market at
the opening lo-day was somewhat Irregular,
May being a nhade higher to J 4c lower at
$1 10?i to $1 10*601 10Â»4. For a moment of
ferings wc-re slightly In excess of .the demand.
Almost immediately; â  however, sentiment
changed, and It became difficult to get re
sponses to bids. TJie result was a quick ad
vance in prices. Liverpool advices were of a
bearish tenor. Quotations on future' deliv
eries at the time of ' opening here were from
â¢ic to %c lower. The apparent reason for
the decline was favorable news received there
from Argentina, together with offerings of
Argentina wheat at 3d decline. As an offset
to theue advices, a local commission house had
a cablegram lrcm a Chicago crop expert now
in Argentina, giving a much less favorable
account of that country's crop.. The claim
was made by this authority that with 2,000,W0
more acres seeded to wheat this year, appear
ance indicated that the total yield would be
somewhat smaller than last year. This was
one causa of the fairly, active demand from
commission houses and shorts that developed
soon after the opening.- Later in the session
the market was further strengthened by a
liberal decrease in primary receipts, arrival's
to-day being only half- as many as on the cor
responding day a year ago. : The "superior
strength of the -December option, -as evidenced
by an advance of over 2c, gave indication that
the cash wheat had been in strong hands, and
also of there being some outstanding shorts
In this month's delivery. ..Shortly before the
close May reached the highest point of the
day. at $1 12.' The market' closed strong
with May ll t c higher at $1 11*4. - ".
- The corn market was strong, partly in sym
pathy with wheat. May closed %c higher at

i Strength In wheat and corn - was . the - main
cause of a firm cats market. May closed

Tne circular of â  Somers . & Co. says : ,
"Receipts of â¢ Hay for the past week havÂ«
been rather light, but 2300 tons having been
brought ,to â¢ market in comparison with 3700
tons -for. the week preceding and 3300 tons for
the -week before that. 7,: In spite of "this de
cline .. In . arrivals we - can report no change â¢ in
market conditions, . for trade' still continues dull
and â  we â  may expect It â  to ; remain so.", at. least
until 'after the : holiday season. . Shipments to
points : outside of San Francisco continue light,
alth >Cgh Southern â¢ California' Is still ' drawing
on our sources of . supply to some extent.
"Reports of large order* being placed here,
presumably for. Oriental shipment, have been
circulated during . the past few days. â¢ As yet
no such shipments have been made from the
port of ' San Francisco, and, â¢ although It is
generally conceded an order has been placed,
market conditions <Â«how no change as a result.
Rumors have been started that eight ox ten
thousand tons of Hay weTe to be shipped In
a very few. days, but It seems quite Impossible
that such an amount could be taken in so
short a period. However, should such exports
become a factor In shaping our local market,
a great deal will depend on the amount of Hay
taken and whether it be drawn gradually, or
In one or two large., shipments. â¢'
"Demand for all grades of Hay remains prac.
tically as before, with the possible exception
of tame oat, which sells fairly well, but at no
Increased figure."- â  â 'â¢

Harrison's circular says: Since the steam
ship Sonoma left there have been but two ar
rivals of Australian Coal from Newcastle. N.
S. W.. viz.: Canrobert. 244B tons: Androme
da, 1856 tons; total, 4302 tons. - The liberal
arrivals during last month have fully supplied
the market for all immediate requirements of
Australian Coals, still the quantity on hand
should be largely consumed by the end of
January next. There are at present chartered
to load at Newcastle with Coal sixteen vessels
with a carrying capacity of about 40,000 tons,
and a large portion of this amount will not
be delivered here for four months to come.
As soon as our rainfall commences the demand
for all the Australian grades now in market
will be very generous and stocks will be freely
eaten Into: selling prices are steady and thwre
is no probability that any reduction will be
made before next summer. The present rates
of freight on Coal . from . Newcastle are very
firm, with no probability of any marked re
duction for several months to come; the de
mand for steam Coal Is almost entirely sup
plied by fuel oil. which Is being freely pro
duced 'at very low prices to the consumers.
The total amount of Australian Coal received
here this year Is about one-half thÂ« quantity
which was delivered here In 1903 and this
will show conclusively the falling oft* of con
sumption of colonial fuel, which Is mainly to
be attributed to tbe free shipments of British
Columbian products, which are very popular
in -this market, and leave a generous profit
to the Importers. ' 0

FRITZ IS CITED
FOR CONTEMPT
In the legal game being played in the
courts between the Police Department
and the Chinese gamblers three moves
were made yesterday en behalf of the
Orientals. Superior Judge Sloss cited
Police Judge Fritz to show cause why
he should not be punished for contempt
for violation of a writ of certiorari; an
application was made to Judge Cook
for a writ of habeas corpus for the re
lease of Yee Gong, who was let out on
1100 bail; Yee Gong sued Chief of Po
lice Wittman for $25,000 damages for
false arrest.
In the matter of Judsre Fritz's alleged
contempt, the affidavit was made by
Chin Kim You, cne of the eighty-three
Chinamen who were arrested in the po
lice raid of the gambling joints in Chi
natown. The prisoners deposited $8300
in bail, which Judge Fritz declared for
feited upon their failure to appear
personally in his court. Then, on De
cember 17, Attorney George D. Collins
secured a writ of certiorari from Judge
Sloss in which Judge Fritz was pro
hibited from proceeding further with
the cases pending the hearing on the
writ to-morrow. When the writ was is
sued bench warrants for the arrest of
Ihe Chinamen were in the hands of
Chief Wittman. and it is declared that
Judge Fritz refused to recall them
and the Chief said that he would make
service regardless of the prohibition.
The citation against the Police Judge
for contempt was made returnable on
January 6. Yesterday afternoon Mr.
Collins had not had it served, and said
that he understood that Judge Fritz
noukl revoke the bench warrants, in
which event the contempt proceedings
mav not be pushed.
Yee Gong, the plaintiff in the dam
age suit, was arrested on one of the
bench warrants on Tuesday by Offi
cers Ellis and Minnehan upon the
statement of two members of the Chi
nese Educational Society that he is one
of the men taken in the raid. Judge
Cook released him on $100 bail and
made the writ of .habeas corpus return
able Saturday.

MRS. MONNIER
OPENS DEFENSE
After many postponements and de
lays George D. Collins, counsel for the
defense in the Monnier will contest,
opened his side of the case yesterday
morning in Judge Graham's court.
The first witness was the daughter of
Mary E. Darling, who said that her
mother adopted George Monnier Jr.,
then known as Charles D. Dewey, and
that she did not believe that George
was in any way related to the elder
Monnier. Dr. J. Albert Bourne gave
expert testimony as to the cause or
Monnier's death and ascribed it to
mental excitement causing cerebral
apoplexy.
At the beginning of the session
Judge Graham overruled three mo
tions made by Attorney Collins and
submitted the issues involved to the
jury. One was the request by Col
lins to strike out all testimony relat
ing to the illegitimacy of George Mon
nier, as the adoption record introduced
by the contestant precluded the testi
mony. Collins also moved that all tes
timony regarding the alleged state
ments of the elder Monnier as to what
he Intended doing for his son be
stricken irom the record.
Jessie Frances Siblette, the daugh
ter of Mary E. Darling, was the first
witness called by the defense. She
proved very aggressive when cross
examined by Attorney Sullivan, mak
ing several sharp retorts and from
time to time appealed to the court to
protect her from answering the ques
tions asked by Sullivan.
Mrs. Siblette testified that her
mother brought the contestant, then
known as Charles D. Dewey, to her
house when he was 2 years 6 months
old. She admitted that she had left
her employment in Los Gatos to come
to the court to prevent falsehood, as
she characterized the testimony that
young Monnier was the illegitimate
son of the elder Monnier. She also
admitted that her mother was known
as Mrs. M. E. Meecham at the time
she signed the adoption record as
Mary E. Darling and that later she
addressed letters to her mother as Mrs.
M. E. Ferrea.
In the afternoon Mrs. Monnier was
called to the stand by Collins and told
of the early life of George Monnier Jr.
and his adoption into the family. She
said that at no time had the elder
Monnier told her that George was his
illegitimate son.
Sullivan attempted to prove that
Mrs. Monnier had taken letters, sent
by her to George while in Europe,
from the son's trunk at the time she
had the young couple ejected, but the
witness denied any. knowledge of the
whereabouts of the letters. The case
will be continued this morning at 10
o'clock.

ART DISCO URAGEMENT
DEPLORED BY HAWKER
A r%ested for Selling Clay,
Images Without License'.
Derides Spirit of Materialism Re
flected by Ordinance.
BY JAMES C. CRAWFORD.
Signor J. Palechi's hair flicked lila
velveteen shoulders as with head
aback he derided the public lack of
art appreciation reflected by his ar
rest for hawking clay statuettes with
out license. It was a sad commen
tary on the vaunted culture of this
community, he averred; that no dis
crimination is shown as between the
peddler of fish or vegetables and the
vender of articles promotlve of esthet
ic taste.
"Whatta da use," he demanded, "of
da artist trya ta maka da leev if he
peenched when he no hava da lice?
Ha, ha! Itta maka me seeck."
It was Signor Palechi's second ar
raignment on the charge of violating
the license ordinance, the first one
having resulted in his dismissal with
a warning, a fact of which he was
gently reminded by Police Judge Mo
gan.
"Malatesta," was the rejoinder.
"Whatta da diff, eh? Sella da stat
no maka da mon lack sella da feesh.
Catena da feesh â maka da stat, eh?
Paya da lice an' be brok alia da time,
eh? Ha, ha!. Notta mooch! No,
sare!"
.The Judge explained that; his func
tion was not to make laws or repeal
them, but to aid in the enforcement
of such laws as were operative. Re
grettable as was the non-exemption of
art works from taxation by license,
such taxation must be obeyed by the
court until it Is wiped from the or
dinance book.
Inquiry developed the information
that Signor Palechi's endeavor to ele
vate the art standard of this mater
ialistic city consisted of his manufac

Case continued till January 6.

i Aftermath of the Britt-Nelson com
bat and its effect upon a mercurial
public' temperament was visible in
three of the departments, Judge Con
lan being the only member of the
magisterial quartet rriio was not re
minded of the great battle.
Judge Fritz had the cse of Michael
Alden, a little Swede, who bet and lost
on Nelson and then was twitted on
his lack of discretion until, he as
sailed two of his tormentors. "Ay
ban feel-an sore," he informed the
court, "an' two fel-lahs yust talked at
may till ay yumped them an' was
pinched." He was fined $5 for fight
ing. '
Frank Johnson, also of Scandina
vian birth and predilection, was fined
a like sum by Judge Cabaniss for dis
turbing the peace of a Market-street
car on which he was riding ferryward
after the fight. So provoked was" he
by the exultation of certain Britt par
tisans that he smote one of them and
was in a fair way of being slaugh
tered when the policemen rescued
him. "Ay ban one fole toe bet," he
said, "an' ay bay one odder fole toe
fight."
Nels Nelson lost this month's wages
because of the great little Dane's in
ability to beat the native son, and then
he borrowed $2, which . he spent for
intoxicants until he was so drunk that
he offered to tie one hand behind his
back and with the free member en
gage Patrolman Curtis in any style
ot boxing the officer might nominate.
He was dismissed by Judge Mogan.
"I had a hunch that Britt would
win," said Miss Nora O'Connor to
Judge Mogan, "and had $20 ready to
bet on him when Lena Larsen told me
the fight was fixed for Nelson to get
the decision. Well, Judge, you know
how the scrap ended and I guess you
can Imagine my feelings. I may have
taken a few. drinks, but I was not
looking for Lena and telling everybody
I was going to kill her. Anybody who
was in the dance hall before this 1 po
liceman came in can tell you that I
was feeling too sore to say anything."
Miss O'Connor was permitted to
wear off her sickness of spirit In free
dom. .
Robert Erskine was watching the
newspaper bulletins from the ringside
and commenting thereon, his criticism
being freely punctuated with expec
torations upon the bystanders as well
as the roadway, when Patrolman
Krack snaked , him out of the inter
ested throng and booked him for vio
lating the anti-spitting ordinance. Dis
missed by Judge Fritz.
Thomas Brennan, a race horse
fancier, went out to the ocean beach
to ascertain how Britt looked and felt
on- the eve or battle and found; the
shifty lightweight 'â¢ splashing in the
surf, while a great throng, divided as
to sex, stood and admired. Disrobing
on the spot and neglecting to don a
bathing costume, Mr. ' Brennan ; leaped
intoi the billows to an accompaniment
of feminine screams | and >waa disport
ing . in a way that ; eclipsed James â¢ Ed
ward's best natatorial stunts when a
policeman happened along, and, for ob
vious reasons, arrested him. Mr.
Brennan did not appear when his
name was called in Judge Cabaniss 1
court and the $50 bail which he had
deposited has gone to the municipal
ity's enrichment.
Mrs. Rose Belletti, about 40, buxom
and decently dressed, was accused .of
shoplifting at the Emporium and the
arresting policeman told Judge Mogan
that her digital dexterity might be en
vied by Herrmann the Great or any
other professional prestidigitateur. She
had 'been detected in the act of palm
ing a ring in Hale's, the officer said,
before she visited the Emporium and
palmed a silk handkerchief. Her at
torney asked for a jury trial and its
dcte will be set to-day.
Charles Reynolds and Lester Selig,
young fellows, had "lifted" a number
of gloves and silk handkerchiefs in
the establishment of Caspar Rainer.
811 Market street, when they were
caught and turned into custody. Judge
Cabaniss gave them five months
apiece..
John Keenan's brother Pat swore to
abstain from the touching, tasting or
handling of intoxicating fluids for a
period of sixty days, the oath being
suggested by Judge Cabaniss and ad
ministered by Clerk "Barney" Conlan
in open court. Pat apparently did not
relish the pledge, but accepted it as the
lesser of two discomforts, as it was the
prescribed alternative of his serving
two months in jail, where he would
be obliged to practice total abstinence,
anyway.
It was for rudely invading John's
shoer*Â»J<er shop, at the Potrero, that
Pat found himself accused of. disorder
ly conduct, Including battery. John
was quietly pursuing his vocation
when Pat burst in upon him like a
whooping cyclone and began to cast
implements of his brother's craft and
boots and shoes left for repair through
the door to the street. John arose from
his stool and ventured expostulation,
whereupon Pat picked a lid from a hot
stove and hurled it with accurate
aim at John's eye. What other out
rages he would have committed if a
policeman had not fortunately arrived
in time to prevent them John was un
able to surmise.
"I have already sentenced you to one
thirty-day term and one,, fifteen-day
term, both for peace disturbance," said
the Judge to Pat, "and now I suppose
it is my duty to double the largest pre
vious dose by giving you sixty days."
Whereupon the complaining brother
expressed hope that the court would
try some reformatory experiment other
than imprisonment, which seemed to
have no deterrent effect upon Pat's
penchant for drinking to excess. "Why
don't your Honor make him take a
pledge of temperance?" John sug
gested.
"'Tisn't a bad idea," responded the
Judge. "Barney, swear him off ' for
two months."
After the ceremony John and Pat
shook hands and left the courtroom to
gether. .

dict. -;/ ..
In his closing appeal yesterday after
noon Garret \V. McEnerney soared into
eloquence in describing. ;the>. affection
felt by Bertha Dolbeer for Miss Etta
Marion Warren. He said that the tes
tatrix was actuated ' by sane and
worthy motives in , bestowing her
bounty on the woman' whom she de
scribed in> her testament as "mv de
voted friend," and whom John Dolbeer
solemnly designated in his will as "a
member of my family." Miss Warren
gave way to tears when the attornev
spoke his feeling words. Reflned
womanhood had fortified her manv
days during the ordeal of the trial and
through the words of reproach by op
posing counsel. But she could contain
herself no longer when McEnerney
touched the depths of the affection for
the girl now dead, whom she had cared
for from childhood and reared throueh
the years to womanhood.
To drive home his point that there
was every consideration (ft proDrietv.
of love, of reasonable impulse, and of
the motives that usually go to the
making of bequests, 'McEnerney very
effectively quoted from the transcript
the declarations that the witnesses
said Bertha Dolbeer had made to them
concerning Miss. Warren.
OVERWHELMING, TESTIMONY.
To Harry Holbrook she said: "I hope
I shall live long. enough to pay back
in some small way Miss Warren for all
her kindness and all of her goodness to
me." . â 
To Miss Helen F. Wagner Miss Dol
beer declared 'that Miss Warren would
always be well provided for bv her. â¢
To William P. Horn, who called on
her after the death of her father. Miss
Dolbeer said "she still had Miss War
ren."
To Mrs. Horace Blanchard Chase
Miss Dolbeer had said, in speaking: of
herself and Miss Warren. "We are like
two sisters in one family." "
To Redick McKee Duperu the testa
trix said she thought Miss Warren was
the best friend she ever had in the
world, except her father.
To Miss Ethel Hager: "Miss Warren
went a-wooing Miss KIttie O'Connor at
the Ferry Hotel on East street, and
after an agreeable tete-a-tete and a
tender leave-taking he missed three $5
gold pieces which were in one of his
vest pockets when he commenced
courting. With reluctance, he arrived
at the conclusion that Kitty had pil
ft-red the coins, and his suspicion was
verified when two of the golden disks
were found concealed In her back hair,
which was arranged in a Maxlne Elliott
puff. The third V could not be dis
covered by the searching policeman,
however, nor would Kittie furnish him
with a clew to Its whereabouts, so she
was arrested and charged with petty
larceny. More testimony will be heard
to-morrow, by~ Judge Mogan.

has been mother, sister and brother to
me. She has been with me since I was
a little girl and has always looked out
for me. I consider myself most for
tunate in having her."
To Miss Alice Hager: "I am more
fortunate than any' one will ever know.
I can never thank Miss Warren for
what she has done for me."
Miss Grace Spreckels testified that
Miss Dolbeer and Miss Warren were
like sisters.
To Addison G. Mlzner, Miss Dolbeer
said at the time of her father's death:
"I do not know what I should do with
out Miss Warren. She has been moth
er, sister and brother to me, and now
she Is to take the place of my father
as well. Miss Warren is the only one
who is near and dear to me in the
world." .:.\
And to Mrs. Phillips, Miss Dolbeer
had declared: "Well, auntie, I am used
to Miss Warren and she Is used to me."
McEnerney named the long list of
witnesses that had been called by pro
ponents to tell of their observations of
Bertha Dolbeer and to give the opinion
that she was of perfectly sound mind.
It would have been impossible, he as
serted, for any signs* of melancholia to
escape all of them. To offset the ex
pert testimony adduced, the proponents
had brought Dr. Herzstein forward,
who conversed with the testatrix for
two hours in Paris and never noticed
a sign of failing mentality. . V-i
MISS WARREN'S ATTITUDE.
As to the fact that Miss Warren was
not called as a witness, of which con
testant's . counsel had declaimed much,
McEnerney said the proponents did not
wish to place her on the stand to be
baited for several days by Johnson.
There could be no other outcome than
charges that her testimony was un
worthy Of belief if it was not favor
able to the cause of contestant. Furth
ermore, the way for admission of a
flood of depositions taken In New York
would be opened if her testimony were
allowed and the trial would be inter
minable.
The policy has been pursued as was
the juridical system in this country till
1865 of closing the witness stand to any
party in Interest. The case could be
proved all the more satisfactorily by
disinterested witnesses, declared Mc-
Enerney, and as such testimony was
abundantly available the proponents
chose this course.
McEnerney did not pay much atten
tion to the testimony of Mrs. Elizabeth
C. Phillips, the most important witness
for the contestant and the only one
who testified that Bertha Dolbeer was
of unsound mind. The showing that
had been made as to her efforts to force
Miss Warren to disgorge $15,000, to be
added to her bequest of $10,000, was
sufficient for the jury, he said. Mc-
Enerney continued as follows:
No . man can say whether Miss Dolbeer's
death was ; accidental or a ruiclde. She left
no evidence of a purpose to take i her own
life. ' She had - written to San Francisco that
she would soon return home. She started from
Paris with the intention of returning home.
In New York she drew $S0O on a letter of
credit to pay for the tickets to San 'Fran
cisco. She called the morclna: before her
death at the' railroad office to engage reserva
tions on the train. The day of departure had
been fixed. In every way did Bertha Dolbeer
sanely make arrangements for ' the trans
continental trip to San Francisco.
The only evidence produced to show that
this younK woman committed suicide Is the
belated testimony, of Alfred Armand. who
deposed that he saw her "walk out of the
window of the alrahaft. appearing to him as
If making her way out upon a roof garden."
The contestant in his opening statement said
he would prove that Bertha Dolbeer suffered
from insomnia continually, but when the wit
ness stand was opeced not a bit of evidence
to this â¢ effect was. flrthcominff. On the con
trary we have proved sufficiently by the evl
dfnee of Miss Grace Spreckels alone that
Bertha Dolbeer did not so suffer. You will
remember that Miss Spreckela told of the visit
of a oarty to Menlo and of the days of ex
citement. ,Yet Bertha Dolbeer slept soundly.
says Miss ; Spreckels. â  who occupied the same
room with i her cne night. The following night
they slept>m separate rooms and on , Inquiry
by the witness .the next morning Miss Dolbeer
said she had passed a restful night. -
This failure of the contestant to prove! the
assertion' made in the. open tng : statement . la
but' one of the many pretensions that have
flimsy foundation In his case. â  .
L Johnson's final appeal to the jury
was ] about an hour long and he went
over ground largely covered in .his
opening address. He again made much
of the allegation that powerful Influ
ence aided and abetted Miss Warren
in the case.. .
