question is to be left to the employers
individually, the association agreeing to
withdraw the demand for the elimination
of the union emblem. As the button
proposition has been the chief stumbling
block during the latest efforts to reach
a peaceable settlement of the difficulty,
it is the general belief that the trouble
is drawing to a close, as all the other
terms of settlement made by the employ
ers have been accepted . by the officials
representing . the strikers. '. During the
meeting with Farwell, the 6Ub-committee
of the Teamsters'y Union assured: the em
ployers* representative that his terms- of
settlement would be satisfactory _to . the
men, but~that~the result "of t the meeting
would have to be reported to the general
committee before any official action could

"The words pronounced by the Emper
er during the. reception or the members
of the Zemstvos of municipalities have
been Incorrectly interpreted by a portion
of the periodical press, and several news
papers have gone so far as to deduce
therefrom the arbitrary conclusion that
the Emperor's words implied an exten
sion of the imperial rescript of March 3
to the Minister of the Interior in the
sense of a convocation of representatives
of the people on the basis of the existing
constitutions of the countries of' Wes
tern Europe, when it was clearly shown
by the Emperor's words that the con
ditions of such a convocation were to be
based on an order of things responding
to Russia's autocratic principles 1 and his
Majesty's words contain absolutely not
the least Indication of the possibility of
modifying the fundamental laws of the
empire.
"Consequently the central administra
tion" of press affairs, by order of the
Minister of the Interior/informs all pub
lications - appearing without censorship
that the Emperor's words; can be pub
liÃhedl only in the form .In which, they
were reported in the Official Messenger.
without additions or â¢ abbreviations, â¢ and,
in orfier^ to prevent distortion of the sig
nificance of the imperial .words, â¢it < is

cord with the direct and clear meaning
of the Emperor's 'utterances."
LODZ. Russian-Poland. June 23.â Eince
â¢arly this morning this city has been
the scene of several bloody encounters
between the troops and the strikers. Sol
diers stormed the barricades erected in
the rtrcets by the strikers and at least
fifty. persons were killed and 200 wounded.
Martial law has been declared. "The
strike is general and all the factories
and shops are closed. Rifle volleys and
revolver shots are heard continually. It
is impossible at present to ascertain t^e
total number of dead with any exactl
tuÂ£e # owing to the general character of
the disturbances. The mob sacked a
number of liquor stores and broke the
street lamps. Street railroad traffic is
interrupted.
WARSAW, Russian-Poland. June 23.â A
man carrying a bomb was arrested this
morning in front of the Malewki police
station. He refused all information re
garding his identity. Disturbances are
anticipated here in consequence of the
shooting of workmen at Lodz.
ST. PETERSBURG. June 24. 3:ls'p. m.â
According to advices received here the
situation in Poland is again exceedingly
serious. Censored dispatches from Lodz,
â though, giving few details, indicate that
fierce street righting was in progress yes
terday (Friday) between the military and
the striking workmen. The latter barri
caded the thoroughfares in various quar
ters cf the city and offered resistance
which the troops met with volleys. The
list of dead and wounded presumably is
large, but not even an estimate has been
received here, Russian correspondents
telegraphing that the streets are entirely
in the hands of the military and the mob
and that it is unsafe to venture out to
obtain details. It is not known whether
the fighting was continued last night,
but it is feared that order can be restored
only at a heavy, sacrifice.
Lodz has been in a turmoil for the past
three days. The strike; which embraces
60.000 workers, appears to have entirely
lost Its economic nature and Is now a
vast political manifestation. All forms
of public business activity have been sus
pended, the peaceful inhabitants remain-
Ing Indoors In fear of their lives. The po
litical zeal of the strikers has become
inflamed by intoxicants from the vodka
shops, which were broken Into and pil
laged.
At Moscow a strike has commenced and
disorders are looked for. The trial of
Okrjey, who threw a bomb at a police
station on March 26, will probably result
In other bomb outrages. A man was ar
rested yesterday morning armed with a
bomb, which was evidently intended to
be used In court during the trial. "
In the meanwhile the Government has
publicly disclaimed all designs as to the
Jtusslncaticn of Poland, the committee of
Ministers in its deliberations on the so
cialist question, which were published
yesterday, saying:
'The committee considers it absolutely
necessary to establish the fact that the
RussiScation and denationalization of the
Poles cannot possibly lie within the in
tent of the Russian Government. The
aim must rather be the amalgamation of
the Polish Government with the Russian
administration and the welding of the
Polish people with the general body poli
tic of Russia by peaceful ties, which will
preserve Polish individuality, culture and
language."

SAN JOSE, June 23.â The annual grad
uation exercises of the 'â¢San Jose Hfgh
School was held, this morning, when the
largest class in the history of the school
was graduated. Assembly hall was beau
tifully decorated with flowers and plants
and the class colors.
This unofficial view is strengthened by.
an Intimation from German diplomatic
quarters that Germany is likely to de-,
cline to give details of the proposed con
ference, insisting that acceptance of the
conference be not conditional upon any
limitations of Its scope. This firmness
on the part Germany Is chiefly respons
ible for the renewal of the excitement on
the Bourse and the widespread uneasi
ness among the public. ;
PARIS. June 23.â An official communi
tion issued fifter the meeting of the
Council of Ministers to-day says Premier
Rouvifr acquainted his colleagues with
the status of the negotiations with Ger
many. These follow the normal course
without change since the delivery of the
note of Prince Radolin, the German Em
bassador. The note was simultaneously
communicated to the French Emba&sa-.
dors abroad for the purpose of informing
the powers.
L'neasinese continues to prevail in par
liamentary circles and among the public
generally concerning the outcome of the
negotiations.
In f^pite of the reassuring tone of the
official communication issued after tTje
Cabinet council, public uneasiness was
accentuated over the strained relations
between France and Germany. .
A geml-offlcia! statement appeared this
evening summing^, up the main feature**
of the French note. It said that instead
of seeking to avoid a conference the note;
invites an exchange of views, thus dis
tinctly showing that France docs not
reject the principle of a conference. The
note further er*?!ains French policy in
Morocco, thug meeting Germany's com
plaint that she had heretofore been de
prived of information relative to the de
velopment of Morocco. The statement
?t tics to show that the . Government
course has advanced a settlement of the
difficulties. Notwithstanding* this Gov-.
eniment witii a large element of the pub
lic In convinced that Germany .will not
accept the note as tending towards an_
adjustment. - Â«
Whi'e the newspapers plainly show dis
ai'Pcir.tmcnt, they all maintain a calm
tone. The situation is not. threatening,
anu nothing is said which Is calculated
to wound French sensibilities.
U.VEASIXESS IX FRANCE.
The National Zeitung, in an evidently
inspired statement, calls attention to the
warlike taptct which the British press
Â«ttcrcj)ts to give to the. situation, whereas
Gfrffiany does not believe that the pres
ent complications are such as to Justify
thoughts of v.ar. â¢ This newspaper fore
! r.udoxvs Germany's rejection of M. Rou
vitr's suggestion that France and Ger
many reach a separate agreement on cer
tain points before submitting the Moroc
can question to a conference, asserting
that Germany maintains her opposition
to any separate arrangement.
The nev-spapt r' emphaties the fact that
the Frtnch note leaves the differences
Viieixi they were before regarding their
bearings upon the projettd Moroccan con
ference. It'te remarked that M. Rouvier
bÂ«Â»= juet succeeded In leaiing room for
an ecceiJtance of the conference If this
ber-mes abt-oluttly necessary.
The Poft remarks that the French Pre-
Crtcr takos a Ftand that lookÂ« strikingly
likt a poIHe but shamefaced refusal, and
tile Vossische Ztitung arrees with the
Post In taring that the answer comes
nearer a refusal than an acceptance of
the conference.
The evening: newspapers frankly ex
press their disappointment at the
French note. Mucn had been staked
upon Premier Rourier's ostensible wtah
to come to an undemanding with Ger
many, but the Vossische Zfltung. dis
cussing the note, says M. Rouvier is
continuing M 7 Dclcasses policy without
11. PHca*se.
DISPUSA&IXG TO CERMA.W.
Gcur.anys answer to Premier Rou
vior has net jiÂ»t boen considÂ«reu. It
will reQuire considerable time in order
to meet all the points raised. While
the d^lay might under ordinary cir
cumstances be of advantage in afford
ing time for the excitement to subside,
German Government circles note with
some concern tfmt powerful intrigues
are eoinp on. having for their object
war between Germany and Prance.
Germany's intentions remain thorough

.PORTLAND. June, 23.â Judge Albert H.
Tanner*, 'chief .witness for the prosecution
in th^ case of -the United States against
.United^ States -Senator Mitchell/occupied
the. witness-stand all day to-day. The
'examination was' concluded late
'this afternoon,' after which' court was ad
journed Â« until | to-morrow, when the de
fense will, begin its cross-examination.
S ,Qnly^nce\tq-day did 'anything occur to
break the' mbnotonous^piling up of docu
mentary- evidence." by \u25a0 the . ( prosecution.
This was whÂ«n=*the \u25a0 court ruled that it
was proper *to 'introduce" evidence tending
to show that Senator MitcheH i *h'ad know
ingly fees In ..other but,- similar
cases' to \u25a0 the one at issue, . for 'the purpose
of proving a: lack of ; probability .'that an
acceptance of *a." fee in -'the'- case 'at ? issue
had .been by inadvertence -or carelessness.
The disagreement arose. over, the"offer of
a r ;letter j and testimony from Judge Tan
ner*"; showing that Tanner and Mitchell
had made 1 an agreement-" with Kribs to
expedite'- certain claims? in December, 1903.
:The j def ense~ objected on the ground
that the.. agreement ;came,:'.outside those
alleged in the. Indictments Attorney Heney
contended that the rules of evidence ad
mitted such â¢ testimony '\u25a0\u25a0 in ?'; certain cases
ascending to prove knowledge and intent
where its lack was set out as a defense,
as im-rthis:';' case.-* .The '\u25a0-' court. .-held with
Heney, ' and Â£ as â¢ a result the testimony of
Judge Tanner .was, admitted In relation
to, the work done for. Benson * and Hyde
of Â« California, "W., E. Burke jof Eastern
Ojpgon, and Le.aiSue, v a* Portland Chinese,
as' well as- other transactions 'before j the
Department' of Commerce and Labor, in
all^f which, it .was contended. Mitchell
haa received his share of the' fees paid.
.Letter after letter, and; telegram after
telegram which had passed ; _between Sen
ator Mitchell arid Judge Tanner were of
fered''in evidence, despite", the efforts of
the defense to stem the flood. In some
of "the letters the Senator asked if his
name had been used in filing papers,
warning the Judge that he could not ap
pear as an attorney before any of the
Government departments; in others
Tanner referred to the matter, stating
that he had not^allowed . the Senator's
name to .be placed to any papers. A
letter from Tanner to his partner told of
a conversation had with Benson, who
was then in Portland, in which jhe had
cautioned Benson that tne Senator could
not be in any of the transactions.
After court had adjourned, Heney said
that he expected the Government^ would
complete its case next Monday afternoon.
A story Is current in the city that the
day -before Grand Duke Alexis resigned
the post of high admiral, be received a
formal warning from the terrorists in
forming him that unless he retired with
in twenty-four hours a sentence, on him
would be passed and 'executed. \u25a0. â¢
The Minister of the Interior has pro
hibited the publication of the Russ for a
month. The Russ was suspended upon
the recommendation of Assistant Minis
ter of the Interior Trepoff.^ The Russ,
which enjoys an immense* circulation,
lately has -been the Government's most
severe critic, waging unceasingly a war
against the bureaucracy and printing ex
posure after exposure. ; " "
The Slovb, M. Wltte's organ, attributes
the origin of the war to the late Interior
Minister yon Plehve and concludes:
"The black page which preceded the
bloody pages of the book of our Far
Eastern affairs has at last been torn
out by the Emperor and all Russia will
rejoice." '.
After the labor disturbances pf. Jan-,
vary 22. , v.'h'ch . resulted in mudh blood
shed in St. Petersburg, it was reported
that Grand Duke Alexis had been con-,
demned to death by the terrorists. It
wbb further at?ertcd that for a longtime
after the murder of Grand Duke Sergius
on February 17, Alexis did not leave his
palace, &s he had again been notified that
the terrorists had placed his name on the
list of those who were to be executed.;
The announcement of Admiral Alex-:
left's retirement was not accompanied by
the usual rescript of praise, and it bears
all the tarmarks of imperial disfavor.
The retirement of .Grand Duke. Alexis as
High Admiral, and of Alexieff as Viceroy
Of the Far East and .the .suppression of
th* Far Eastern committee in quick suc
cession are the best evidence .that Japan
could need that the Emperor has washed
bin hands of the whole Manchurian ad
venture. The Liberal press greets the.
demise of the Far Eastern Committee
wish a howl of exultation as being, the
final blow to the policy which led to the
present war. â¢ \u25a0 v .-
BT. PETERSBURG. June 23.â The Vice
royalty of the Far East having been abol
ished by the imperial ukase of June 21,
Admiral Alexitff hag been appointed a
member of the council of the empire and
vill continue to hold his position as aide
de-camp ceneral to the Kmperor.
The . claims of . the Commissioners for
pay for work already performed hayÂ»
been held vp k by the Sttae Board of Ex
aminers upon the ground that under tha^
constitution State officials cannot draw
two salaries. They will not bÂ« paid until
the courts decide on the point.
Assemblyman H. F. McCartney of Los
Angeles, who Is a member of the commis
sion, has written a statement to the Ex
aminers In which he contends that the
commission does not come under the head
of the law providing that officials shall
not draw two salaries. He holds that
hold-over members of the Legislature
have the right to take pay for special
work performed upon a commission.
SACRAMENTO. June # 23.â At tha last
session of the Legislature an act was
passed providing: for a joint commission
of two members of the Assembly and
two members of the Senate, with tha

3. A. Worthlngton, recently elected
vice president of the Wheeling and Lake
Erie road, may soon return to California
as vice president and general manager
of the, Western Pacific Railway. He has
been offered the latter position by the
Goulds, but Is carefully considering the
proposition before giving his answer.
From a local authority on Western Pa
erSc affairs it was learned yesterday that
ttie matter of Worthington's selection for
the responsible position with the new
-transcontinental line was discussed by
ihe financial backers of the road several
months before the company was reor
ganized, and It is said that he received a
flattering offer from the Goulds about the
time that they began negotiating with
him to accept the position of vice presi
dent of the Wheeling and Lake Erie road.
The appointment of Worthington to the
vice presidency of the Wheeling and Lake
Erie road Is now said to have been part
ot the plan of the Goulds to permit him
to remain In Pittsburg long enough to
acquaint himself with the traffic business
of thS Gould lines, then send him out to
thus coast as the chief executive of the
Western Pacific at this end of the road.
FRIEXDS ARE ADVISED.
Friends of Worthingtcn here and In
Sacramento have already been advised of
the opportunity offered him to return to
San Francisco, and they are confident
. that he will not ignore it. That George
Gould and his associates in the trans
continental railroad system appreciate the
ability of Worthington was plainly evi
denced in the appointment they gave him
in their system. He was unwilling 1 at
first to leave the Harriman lines, where
he made his reputation as a railroad ope
rator, and did so only after the Goulds
had several times increased their orig
inal offer of salary.
When be went to Portland as the gen
eral manager of the Oregon Railroad and
Navigation Company, Worthington, writ
ing to several of his friends in this city,
remarked that he would have preferred
.to have made a sacrifice in order to re
turn to San Francisco and had only taken
the Portland position in the hbpe that his
future services with the Harriman lines
would be rewarded with an appointment
in San Francisco, presumably the man
apemtmt of the Southern Pacific. ~ -
It was generally conceded yesterday by
local railroad men. who discussed the
probability of Worthington's returning to
this city, that no man at present in "the
employ of the Goulds and available for
Ihe position of general manager of the
Western Pacific is so well informed on
conditions in California, and for that
matter, Nevada and Utah, as Worthlng
ton. His many years' association in the
offices of the chiefs of the Southern Pa
cific gained for him knowledge that would
be most valuable to the projectors of the
Western Pacific in their construction
work.
APPOINTMENT SOON DUE.
While Vice President Bartnett of the
nev.- road is not yet prepared to say any
thing about a general manager, it is well
known that one will be appointed at an
early date. Worthington's knowledge of
the territory of the Southern Pacific
would materially aid the Goulds in deter
mining on branch lines, which, as already
announced in the press, they propose to
build while the construction of the main
line is under way.
It was common gossip at the Southern
Pacific offices yesterday that a prominent
official of the operating department ot
tSat road has received a letter from
Worthington, in which he refers at length
to the possibility of his coming back to
California and strongly intimates that if
he accepts the position of general man
ager of the Western Pacific the friend
may expect a lucrative and responsible
place under the general manager.
Yesterday Vice President Bartnett filed
for record in this city a certificate of the
bonded indebtedness of the company, as
covered by the newly executed mortgage.
The filing of the document was a legal
formality required by law. To-day the
directors of the road will continue their
deliberations, and early next week it is
understood that they will take up with
Chief Engineer Bogue the awarding of
contracts for the construction of the main
line at various points in Utah, Nevada
and California.

While* it may be shown on the official
surface that the Cabinet is in harmony
on the subject of modifying the exclusion
act, there has been an effort to prove
that the claims of the Pacific Coast of a
"yellow peril" are unfounded. Secretary
Metcalf has attempted to qualify this
impression, so he says, and \ make the
East understand that California is not
fighting . immigration from Asia on any
other ground than that upon which -is
fought the battles against immigrants
from, the lower classes of Europe.
The President made it clear at the
meeting to-day that he was determined
the Chinese should have fair treatment
under the law, whenever they applied for
admission to this country at any port.
He believed this was not only in the in
terest of American manufacturers and
business men, but ho more than just to
the Chinese. While no definite decision
was reached at to-day's meeting, it was
the generally expressed opinion \u25a0 that . the
amicable diplomatic, and trade relations,
which this country has always main
tained with China, should be continued If
possible. To this end Secretary Hay will
take, action on behalf of this country.
The report that the commercial; guilds
of China have entered into a hard and
fast agreement to boycott American
made goods has had a disturbing effect
on. American producers interested . in the
Chinese trade. It/ will be the effort of
this Government to endeavor..to correct
any misunderstanding- that may ; exist, In
China as to 'the enforcement of the Chi
nese exclusion laws. There is no dispo
sition to exclude from the country any
of the classes'of Chlnesewho are~Â«xempt
from the operation of the exclusion law.

WASHINGTON, June 23.â There seems to
be a decided difference of opinion be
tween President Roosevelt and Secretary
of Commerce and Labor, Metcalf.^ Al
though it has been repeatedly denied that
the President has asked Metcalf, with
some degree of severity, to use his offi
cial prerogative to lessen the evil of "un
just* discrimination" against Asiatics, It
was emphasized to-day at a lengthy Cab
inet.meeting that the administration does
not think that the immigration bureaus
of the country have shown as much di
plomacy as is necessary.
The Cabinet discussed the situation for
nearly three hours. Prior to the confer
ence. Secretary Taft said:
"This is a very serious question. The
President is inclined to modify the ex
clusion laws, but only to that extent that
will permit of fair and impartial treat
ment to students and merchants. \u25a0 He has
not deviated from his policy of legislat
ing against the coolie."
Secretary Metcalf said: â ,
"I am in favor of following to the letter
the provisions of the Chinese exclusion
act. I am really in no position to* talk
of tÂ».c matter."

Hyde said he was anxious for an imme-'

.the 'ownership of this fund, for "if he is
right, as he believes himself to be, the
decision will relieve him from the criti

BERLIN, June* 23.â Over sixty policy

Society held a , meeting here j to-day un

and on which the report*is based."
-He was of the opinion that separate
actions would be taken,- one for^the resti
tution of funds wrongfully taken and an
other for -the debarment .proceedings
against officers of the- society. He said:
"This is a novel action, and it is the
first time In the history of. the State of
New York where debarment proceedings
against officials of an insurance company
will have been 'taken. Under the insur
ance laww the application .of which nas
never yet been put in practice, the Attor
ney General has power, to debar officers
of an insurance company who have been
found derelict in their duty, and this de
barment not only precludes them from
holding positions as officers, but also de
bars them from acting as directors, not
only in the company \from which they
have been -debarred, but from any other
insurance company doing business within
the confines of the State, and the Attor
ney General . Is the one to enforce the
action." â¢ l â¢'\u25a0\u25a0 ' -

soon he would begin action against
the FJquitable officers scored in the
Hendricks report, Mayer replied:
"It is; unusual for the Governor to
address a -letter such as'-I have re
ceived to the District Attorney, and it
focuses . public attention upon me. I
have made arrangements j with Justice
Davy of the criminal branch of the
Supreme Court and he will, continue

At the regular meeting of the Board of
Police Commissioners last night the
names of Policemen Percy Smith, Frank
Wratten, P. Kissane and Hiram Hutch
ings were ordered placed on the meri
torious book as having shown unusual
bravery in the attcrpted capture of
Lobb, the maniac who shot ten 'people
from the third story of the United States
Hotel last Wednesday morning. Captain
Duke, in his report of the affair, paid a
special tribute to the bravery of Hutch-
Inps. "The chief hero of this heroic
band," he said, "was Officer . Hiram
Hutchinss, who descended a fire escape
to a position "opposite tne maniac's win
dow and there prepared, In midair, to
engage with this man in a. duel, with
every advantage on the side of the lat
ter. I believe that Hutchings* appeal ance
at the window was the sole cause of this
man's suicide, and the police were re
lieved of the unpleasant duty of killing
him, in doing which it ie hard to esti
mate, ihe number of our brother officers

Starting I'olnt.
Arthur t- Adams, consulting: engineer
of the Contra Costa Water Company,
occupied the witness stand yesterday in
Unitod States Commissioner Heacock's
courtroom, testifying as to the value of
the properties of the Spring Valley
Water Company. He estimated thepres
errt value of. the property at $50,000,009
arid its actual cost at $35,000,000; but.
he said, if the income allowed to the
company were based on the $50.000,00<Â»
,\'alustion the rates would be unfair to
the consumer, and If allowed on tho
$35,000,000 valuation it would be unfair
to the company. He suggested that the
two Rims should be added together and
the total divided by two, making a new
biifis of $42,600,000. and to allow the
water company I per Cent on that sum.
He stated further that the Spring
Valley Company had a monopoly of all
the sources of water supply within a
radius of twenty miles from" this city.
Thp hearing will be resumed next Mon
day In the water company's offlce.

During- tho campaign Governor Car
ter issued a signed statement declaring
that the supporters of Brown, if suc
cessful, intend to use Brown's election
to discredit the Territorial administra
tion. It Is believed here that President
Roosevelt will urge Governor Carter to
remain In office. Governor Carter is
said to favor Speaker Knudson as his
successor. i ; '
Considerable" surprise is manifested
hero in relation to the resignation. and
regrets have been expressed by promi
nent citizens, some of whom tried to
prevent his action. The resignation is
believed by some to "be ' due to the
strong vote that replaced Arthur Brown
in the office- of Sheriff after Governor
Carter had removed hlm.~ .' :\u25a0
"I have advised President Roosevelt to
accept my resignation, and have urged
him to select my successor," said Gov
ernor Carter to The Call representative.
"My mind is made up and my worries are
over. I have not been led to take .this
step because of the. election of A. W.
Brown to the Shrievalty of the courts of
Oaku. My action is the culmination ot
a long series of events not necessary to
recapitulate at this time. My resignation
was written on June 6.- I- showed it to
one or two of my friends, and they asked
me to take time for reconsideration be
fore acting finally, to be sure that it was
not an impulse. I have taken time, and
have only been the more determined to
take the course that I had marked out
for myself. In accordance with that de
termination I wrote; to the President by
the last steamer,- enclosing (my resigna
tion, which. I begged him to accept." I
will leave on the- next Alarrieda and go
directly to -Washington."
The resignation -was the culmination
of a long series of . events which led
Governor Carter to ' the' conclusion that
he could.be of more service to the Ter
ritory of Hawaii outside the Guberna
torial chair than.in that position. "',
Territorial Secretary Atkinson 'ar
rived to-day from China. He has been
regarded as likely, to succeed Governor
Carter, but this has been found to be
impossible, as he is only 34 years old,
while the law requires the Governor to
be at least 35 years of age. Among
those mentioned as possible appointees
to tho ortice are H. E. Cooper. W. O.
Smith. Edward Tenney, H. P. Baldwin
and Scnntor Dowsett, ' Â»
HONOLULU, June 23.â Governor Carter
has mailed bis resignation to President
Roosevelt, and will leave here on June 28
for Washington; to discuss i the matter of
his retirement from the Governorship. He
has been in cable corresporjience with the
President regarding it, } ariH has received
permission to â¢ go to the^ capital for a
personal interview.
Governor Carter declares that he has
had this step In contemplation for a long
time. The resigriatlon~itself was actually
written on June 6, but it was held back
in deference to the advice of some of the
Governor's friends who were told of his
intention and begged him to reconsider
his intention before taking the final step.
Special ! Cable to The Call.
The committee . on laws; had the floor
all day, and submitted many propositions
affecting the policy and the relations be
tween unions. The committee . will finish
its. report at the morning session. There
are still' several" committees ; to be -heard
from, and it may require an afternoon
session to completethe work of the con-
"Yesterday morning' opened with a de
bate that lasted practically all day,* with
the r exception X of : the ;: . time .given the
speechmakers.- '.The debate' was over the
demand of the flat-bed pressmen or feed
ers sto be allowtd! the; privilege of work-
Ing, on .the web -or' newspaper presses,
providing .the men* adhere to the web
men's schedule of .wages and hours' To
this was added an amendment that pro
vided /the stipulation - that the flat-bed
pressmen, must -have -received the web
men's scale of -wages 'for two months
prior , to i working jon web j presses. \
The debate was cafried, oh heatedly, by
both sides for. arid against the'proposi
tion or its amendment, and for a time the
hall was a -pandemonium while the dele
gates hurled personalities at one another.
In . the midst -of the excitement, and to
allay ;. the -- heat 'of the 'combatants, O. A.
Tveitmoti /; permission \u25a0 to ad
dressy the* convention on -the Japanese
exclusion questiori. : This permission was
granted and the argument, was closed

Asiatic on this coast and the purpose of
the' Exclusion League in defending Amer
ican labor, from cheap competition. Ha
spoke -of the work and imitative faculties
of 'the brown .men, and also of their
standards, of living, as compared with
whites. He closed with an allusion to the
race problem the United Sttaes already
contends with- in the South, and urged
the delegates to do all in their, power to
prevent Asiatic immigration.
James Grant of the Sailors' Union also
addressed the meeting in a like manner.
He told of the opening up of Japan and
the arrival here of Japanese first^ln'the
guise of .sailors, then "as fishermen 'and
farmers, and their, successful competition
with whites, owing to their cheap way of
living^ Both \u25a0 speakers were heartily ap
plauded, but their, remarks were soon for
gotten in the : rent wal of the debate on
the pettion of the -flat-bed pressmen. /
The noon hour was near when the ar
gument ended, and .voting by. rollcall be
gan. .The vote upofu the amendment- was
first taken upland! the amendment was
lost. ' \u25a0' /Then,"* he; original proposition was
submitted N and; by. an oral vote, was car
ried. The* matter : appeared settled until
the. afternoon, when another proposition.,
In Itself harmless, was submitted. To it,
however, was added an amendment that
Included the Vtwo^inonths"."-, phrase, arid
the argument-it aroused lasted nearly, all

One by one the Doric's officers picked
out the three fugitives. That night or
the next day a Japanese officer boarded
the Doric, thanked the officers for the
information and said he was *rlad to
report that the Japanese had taken all
three of them. The Doric's officers do
not remember the names, but a cable
gram received May 30 from Nagasaki
said: "The three war vessels sighted
by the Doric were the Izumrud, also a
cruiser of the Aurora tj^pe and the gun-
Doat Kazarasky. the latter leaking"
W T hen the Doric arrived here If was
supposed that the vessels they saw
were the three cruisers which after
ward reached Manila.
The Doric's officers say that the three
Russian ships which they helped to de -
Hver mto the hands of England's ally,
the Japanese, were painted so as to
make them ideal targets. Hulls, upper
works and spars were almost invisible
under a lead colored coat of what is
now officially recognized as war paint
01^ E if Cks ' howeve r. were sharply
outlined in black and white stripes and
as each vessel had three funnels the
Japanese gunners did not have to be
fcigher mathematicians to know where
to flnd a place for their big shells
The Doric's officers said they thought
they would. Within half an hour a
Japanese official came on board with
an album, in which was an excellent
photograph of every warship that
flies the flag of the Czar. - b-
The thoroughness of the Japanese
preparations for the undoing of Rus
sian power in the Far East is. illus
trated by an incident which occurred
upon the arrival at Nagasaki of the
Occidental and Oriental Steamship Com
pany's liner Doric. The Doric arrived
here tbe other day and her officers tell
the story.
About 2:40 p. m. of May 28. the sec
ond day of the battle of the Sea of
Japan, the Doric, on her way to Naga
saki, about 100 mi]es away and 140
miles south of the battle-ground,
sighted three Russian war vessels. One
of them was low in the water and evi
dently in dire distress. Her pumps
were going and an immense stream was
pouring from her side. In spite of the
pumps, however, she seemed to be
sinking lower and lower.
The Russians, when the Doric passed,
were circling about in an apparently
aimless way. evidently anxious to keep
secret their Intended destination. One of
the Czar's ships dipped her ensign in
acknowledgment of the Doric's salute,
but no other signals were exchanged,
and the Doric proceeded without find
ing out the names of the ships of war.
Early next morning the Doric
reached Nagasaki. The liner was
boarded by Japanese 6ecret service
men, who inquired as to whether any
Russian ships had been sighted. Cap
tain Smith told all he knew. He gave
the Japanese the posrtion in which he
had left the Russians and informed
them of tbe almost helpless condition
of at least one of them.
"What were their names?" the secret
service man asked.
. "We could not make out their
names."
"Would you know the ships If you
should see them again?"
At a meeting of"the executive commit
tee of the San Francisco Republican
League at 63S Market 6treet last evening,
delegations from the Twenty-eighth,
Thirty-third, Thirty-fourth, Thirty-sev
enth, Thirty-eighth, Forty-second, For
ty-third, Forty-fourth and Forty-fifth As
sembly, districts were present. The at
tendance at headquarters of the league
was large and in the throng were many
well known and active citizens of Re
publican faith.
The preliminary work of district organ
ization is very nearly finished. To-night
the lists of district committeemen will be
given to the public. During- the present
week there have been conferences at
league headquarters of the citizens select
ed to manage district work or organiza
tion for the campaign. It is reported
that harmony prevails in all the Assem
bly district committees, except those of
the Twenty-eighth and Fortieth. It. is
common gossip that Henry Ach of the
Fortieth prefers to train with Ruef and
Schmltz. Last night Peter Kelly and
Walter Larson, who were named as mem
bers of the committee of ten from the
Twenty-eighth Assembly District, with
drew and threatened to make an inde
pendent fight. The executive committee
would not allow Kelly and his followers
to name a majority of the district repre
sentatives.
It \u25a0is expected at league headquarters
tliat the Ruef press will spring a story
to the effect that Peter Kelly and Walter
Lai&en would not stand for Martin Kelly
and therefore pulled out. The real facts
are that Martin Kelly cuts no figure
whatever in the. affair. Owing to his
troubles in Sacramento and the critical
illness of his daughter ho is out of poli
tics for this campaign and, more than
that, he frankly says that he Is out. The
presumption is very stiong that Peter
Kelly expects assistance from Abe Uuef
and John Lynch in his fight against, the
league.
Larsen is a saloonman on Steuart
street. The fact is noted that the retail
liquor dealers are fighting shy of promi
nence in the fight to. down the grafters
of the Schmitz administration. They be
lieve that active work for the better
ment of local government would lead to
revocation of their licenses to do busi
ness.
The space given in the Ruef press to
misrepresentation of the league's work
of organization is accepted as proof that
tho grafters are alarmed over the increas
ing strength of the forces of good citizen
ship. There is gossip v that Ruef's fol
lowers will endeavor to create trouble in
Republican ranks by advisii;g \he Repub
lican County Committee to engage in the
work "of Assembly district organization
along lines different from those adopted
by the San Francisco Republican League.
lln conformity with law the Republican
County Committee will meet at 121 Eddy
; street next Wednesday evening to adopt
a cail for the local nominating conven
tion and to fix the apportionment of dele
gates to said convention to be voted for
at the primary election on August 8. The
call for the meeting of the county com
mittee is signed by Charles Sonntug,
acting chairman, and T. E. Atkinson, sec
retary. The call is regular and timely.
A strong sentiment in favor of a large
convention prevails in the Republican
camp. The Ruetltes may endeavor to-put
through a scheme of organization to di
vide the forces of the party, but as a
majority of the county committeemen
are members of the organized Republican
League, the play is not likely to win.
Major C. W. Kyle and Assemblyman
Coghlan addressed a meeting of Thirty
fifth Assembly District Republicans at
Twenty-second and Bartlett streets la*?t
Wednesday evening. The speakers ad
vised the citizens to .send an able and
honest delegation to the Republican nom
inating convention.

NEVADA COUNTY STIRRED/"
A, strong: effort is being made 'in Ne

the Carhlnetti law.. Some extracts frorri"

herewith. The Miner-Transcript says:
If any one will note the coincidence that the
interference with mining by the hydraulic pro
cess and the departure of a large part of our
population were closely connected in

with our opinion that the latter was
due to the - former. Go up- to the Coun
ty Courthouse some day when In Nevada City
and look at the fac simile of a month's gold
output fiom the North Bioomneld. That gold
Is not coming out of the ground any more, al
though its like Is still there to the value of bil
lions of dollars. Quartz mining cannot wholly
take the ' place of such a productive force as
that. - That output was due , to the hydraulic
process â now,* with neither - right nor reason,
barred by. law." â¢:'\u25a0.<â¢-- ;
(The man who owns property has the right to

The Los Angeles Herald gives .particu

ern California to join oil producing in
terests that " are hot under * the control
of the Standard Oil Company.' People at
this end of the State are not sanguine
in the view that the Standard Oil. after
what has happened, can easily' be beaten.
The Herald says:
With the Incorporation of the Union Provi

a paid in capital of $102. 000, prominent oil men
see the beginning of a plan which, when con
summated, will mean the amalgamation of the

possession of the Standard Oil -Company.
Tbe articles of incorporation were filed with

deposited with the "Wickersham Banking
Company as security for a loan of
$30,000."
"That will do for this . time," inter
rupted Judge Graham. "The point I want
to determine is whether or not you are
willing to support your children."
'.'I certainly am," answered ; Paxton.
"How much are you .willing to pay;
can you continue to pay $100 a month?"
'"Well I would first haveto;look fully
into my affairs. They are in" such bad
shape j that I cannot tell at this time
what I will be able to do in the future.
It is alleged here that I am worth $100,000,
but this is not true. If I were sold out
to-day I wouldn't be worth a cent."
! At this point the witness^ was released
from the stand and his brother, Charles
Paxton, was called forward.
Charles Paxton testified that his broth
er, Blitz, had been left $185,000 In his
mother's will and was of the opinion
that Blitz's unincumbered, share in the
Madrona Knoll Ranch, Sonoma County,
was worth easily" $40,000. Stock - claimed
by Blitz In the Sonoma County Bank,
valued at $32,535, was- claimed by the
heirs of the late Mrs. Hannah Paxton,
mother of the witness, but Charles was
of the opinion that . Blitz was fui*y
solvent. -' â¢;"'â¢ -\u25a0'- -i* V
"Well," said Judge Graham in con
clusion.;"! will continue this hearing until
September- 22. At that time the agree
ment under which Mrs. Paxton is-receiv
ing $100 a month for the maintenance of
her children will expire. Until then Mr.
.Paxton can look into his affairs and
while assuring the plaintiffs here that an
allowance will be granted them I do not
care at this time to'flx the amount. It
will be better that -it be fixed , at the
time named." \u25a0/... \u25a0' \u25a0
During the hearing Mrs. Paxton watched
every move of her former husband. . He
did not look at her, but glanced once or
twice at his children. His glance was
one of curiosity, that's all. ,
Paxton 1 was ordered, to the stand and
was Interrogated at length as to the con
dition of his estate.
Though yet "in the breast of the court,"
to be uttered in the i future, Judgment
stands against Blitz W. Paxton, the So
noma capitalist,' who sought on a plea of
poverty to evade'a decree compelling him
to maintain . hi 3 blind son and invalid
daughter. \ln obedience to \an order <etf
court ; Paxton appeared before Judge
Graham yesterday to show cause why he
should . not- / maintain his offspring.
Toward him were turned . the sightless
eyes of his son, and holding the lad by the
hand was his mother, ever watchful of
his ; interests : by her side was her frail
and . pretty daiighter, Roma. s - fy
Edwin : Sweeney was . ordered to pay
Henrietta Sweeney. $33 a - month alimony.
Johanna Gorman abandoned her attempt
to get some money out of her former hus
band, Thomas F. Gorman. "Let the case
go. Judge," she said. â¢ "You can't get
blood out of a turnip. Every time I
come here to try, to collect from him I
lose time/ and time is money to me. - Let
him go." The order to show cause was
dismissed.
Thomas B. Eagen is in the Broadway
Jail for refusing to pay. his wife alimony,
as ordered by Judge Kerrigan. His wife,
Mary, had him in court, and when she
had concluded her story Judge Kerrigan
ordered Eagen to pay her $35 forthwith.
"Well, she will wait -a long time before
she gets it," replied Eagen impudently.
"Mr. Clerk, raise that to $50," said Judge
Kerrigan, "and, Mr. Bailiff, take Mr.
Eagen into custody- and deliver him to
the Sheriff for confinement until such
time as this order is obeyed." So Eagen
went forth to Jail.
Decrees of divorces were - granted yes
terday to Katie from Angelo Bertola for

JOHANNA GORMAN DESPAIRS.
\u25a0."Well, Just to show my good faith and
to prove that I will give my wife all I
can," said Jesse Russell, bell boy at the
Lick House, in Judge Graham's . court
yesterday, "I will tell you a story. A
little while ago I met May on the street
and she told me she needed some money.
I only* had $1 20 with me. but I slit it
and gave her 60 cents to buy stockings
with. There, that shows my good inten
tions."
The foregoing was Russell's defense to
an order to show cause why he refused
ta_pay his wife alimony as ordered by the
court. After. he ".had told this story the
court concluded that it at least entitled
him to a short respite, and continued the
case for. a week to enable Russell to
rustle up a little money.
"Yes, I* did buy some beer and took it
home, but, upon my word. I didn't drink
a bit of it," said John Kleiner, who was
before Judge Graham on an order to
show cause . why he refused to pay his
wife, Minnie, alimony as ordered. Mrs.
Kleiner testified that her husband re
fused to work, and was a frequenter of
saloons in their neighborhood. His pro
testation of Innocence concluded with the
statement regarding the beer. Judge
Graham also gave him a week In which
to mend his ways.
The boy, "Wayne, also testified in an
other affidavit that his mother fre
quently beat him and' often entertains
Mike Cummlngs, a butcher, at her home,
at which times she locks him and his
little sister out of the house. In another
affidavit it is set forth that Mrs. Batch
elor admitted that she was intimate with
many married men of her neighborhood,
and compelled each of them to pay her
a monthly, allowance under threats of ex
posure. -
BUYS WIFE STOCKINGS.
"My mother frequently choked me and
knocked -my head on the floor," says the
daughter, "and one day after she had
beaten me my father, who is good to me,
gave me $1 50. I - put the money on a
rafter out. ln an old house, and I Intended
to take it should my mother beat me any
more and pay my fare and that of my
brother to some other town."
A pitiful condition existing in the
household of , L. D. Batchelor, a promi
nent farmer of Sonoma "County.+was re
vealed I yesterday: wnen he filed several
affidavits in support of his petition for a
divorce from Susie Batchelor. In one af
fidavit the little daughter of the couple,
Alvina, testifies that her mother fre
quently entertained men at their home,

brother. . r ; - "

Aged Merchant Dies After
He Gets Favorable De
cree, but Feud Goes On
Though Solomon A. Kusel is dead tha
fight to obtain possession of his estate of
$45,000 still goes on. His wife, whom he
has been fighting in the courts for nearly
tor. years, will contest his will, in which
she has been left only 55.
â¢ Ten years ago the aged merchant be
came estranged from his wife. She in
stituted suit for dtvorce and a bitter legal
battle ensued. The old man gave up his
business and devoted his entire time to
the contest. ~ V--
Judgment was finally rendered In favor
of the wife and she was granted an al
lowance of ttO.COO. Through his attor
neys, Rlordan and Lande. Kusel ap
pealed to the Supreme Court. On July 7
of this year the judgment of the lower
court was set aside and Kusel was
granted a new trial. This restored tha
woman to the position of his wlfa.
A few days after this decision in his
favor Kusel died. A will was found hi
which he left the wifa he had been fight
ing only $5. Thejwill comes up for pro
bate on July 7.
The value of the estate vu $45,000.
What It is worth now is hard to say, as
Kusel neglected his financial affairs .to
further the bitter fight against his wife.
His aversion to her in his later years was
so strong that he published a pamphlet
denouncing the Judges who bad decided
against him.
A contest against the will is to be filed
within a few days by Attorney Lande.
Some sensational charges will be made
against relatives of the aged man. H.
E. Monroe is attorney for the estate.. -

His undoing was brought about by the
temerity and nimbleness of a Caucasian
peace guardian, who trailed him Into a
seraglio chamber which proved to be a
cul de sac.
sigh of relief went up from Waverly
place, and when Judge. Mogan" sentenced
Wong Kee to six months' imprisonment
there was talk among the pig-tailed
bench-warmers of celebrating the event
with" pyrotechnics. 80 intense was the
satisfaction conveyed by the sentence to
one full-skirted Celestial that he handed a
cigar to Clerk "Pat" Grey, who said he
appreciated the gift so_ highly, that he
would never smoke it, but preserve it as
a souvenir of the joyous occasion.
Wong Kee had long been a nocturnal
annoyance to the reiÂ».wents of Waverly
place ere his arrest was effected. It
was his wont to travel over house roofs
and drop through skylights and scare
harem Inmates nigh to death and pilfer
such articles as he could safely get away
with. So elusive was he that a hundred
traps set for - him were unproductive of
desired result. His agility was phenom
enal, for report had it . that he . experi
enced no more difficulty in making his
exit through a- lofty skylight than in
dropping through It, and rumor oft de
picted him clambering up steep walls
and along ceilings as if he were a fly.
Thus it came that the women regarded
him as a "devil," and the men hesitated
to regard him as anything else. <

Judge Mogan released, on her own
recognizance, Mrs. Annie Smith of 12 &
Tefcama street, against whom a' charge
of attempt to do great bodily harm has
been pending ever since she thrust
Mrs. Moore through the window of a
house on Third street. Mrs. Smith has
spent the interim in jail, and so ema
ciated did shÂ« become that the Judge
Mrs. Ellen O'XeHI of 1312 Harrison
street, objecting ?to one of her two
stalwart sons, a policeman, bringing his
bride into the family, manifested her
displeasure by battering the young
woman, and to Judge Cabaniss it was
explained' that the assault was In
spired by ., radfcernal jealousy purely.
The old lady's sons said they were will
ing to do Anything within their power
tba.t might contribute to her happiness,
but feeling it was impossible for their
respective wives to dwell in amity with
her. they suggested she be sent to a.
borne for aged ladies and kept there at
their expense. Then it was disclosed
that Mrs.. O'Neill could get along com
fortably without their pecuniary aid, as
she had $700 in bank- The Judge, after
advising her to do as her big boys de
sired, continued the case thirty days.
Sixteen-year-old Josie Mfller, who
eloped from Tennessee with sixty-year
old William Etubbs and then trans
ferred her affection to a young private
soldier, has asserted her feminine pre
rogative to undergo a change of mind,
and this afternoon she will be married
to her aged admirer by Judge Cabaniss.
She was en route to a reformatory in
stitution via Judge Conlan'a court
when she decided to wed, but bin Honor
Conlan declined to unite May and De
cember, and Judge Cabaniss gallantly
promised to tie the knot. As the girl
Is under the age which permits a fe
male to become a wife without the con
sent of parent or guardian, one of the
court attaches will be sworn to act In
the latter capacity and give away the
bride. It was suggested that the jilted
son of mars be enlisted to give her
away, but the court spurned the sug
gestion.
Mr. Lehmann, who is a baker at 1153
Market street, was charged with may
hem, but the woman's testimony sufficed
to satisfy the court that she was as
much to blame as he for the amputation
of her finger Joint, so the case was dis
missed.
"Take it away," shouted the Judge,
thrusting the package into the hand
from which he had unsuspectingly re
ceived It.
Patrolman T. J. Kavanagh handed to
Judge Mogan a small paper parcel, and
when his Honor unwrapped it there
lay disclosed to his view the first joint
of a woman's little finger. The grew
some exhibit had been detached from
Liberta Aguillar's left hand while she
was resisting S. K. Lehmann's attempt
to enter her "crib" on Plnckney alley
at 11:45 o'clock last Thursday night.
The sudden and unexpected withdrawal
of his pressure caused the door to shut
with euch force as to slice off the por
tion of her finger there presented in
evidence.
Mr. Laymance is at Howard Springs,
of which he is the owner, and if he de
clines to return to this city and face
the chauffeur's charge an effort will be
made to effect his arrest where he Is.
Not very long ago he posed as com
plainant In Judge Mogan's court against
a tenderloin Eiren, who was charged
â¢with having pilfered some valuables
belonging to him.
feathers from a peacock perched on a
lofty tree branch. Near by was an
automobile, in which 6at a man and
woman, both of whom were orally en
couraging the climber, but they dashed
away in the machine and left him to
his fate when the policemen ap
peared. The prisoner stoutly declined
to disclose their identity, and not until
J prisonment starÂ«?d him in the face
did he yield to the advice of Park Com
missioner Reuben H. Lloyd, who had
prosecuted the case, and tell who they
were. Nor is it likely that he would
have done so even then if Laymance
had made good his pledge to promptly
pay whatever fine might be imposed.
So after swearing to the complaint
against Laymance the youth was al
lowed to go tree on his promise to ap
pear !n court when wanted.
The woman in the auto was Lillian
"Winters of the underworld, and it was
her love of fine feathers that led to
the plucking of the peacock. When
she saw the bird of gaudy plumage
roosting on the tree limb she expressed
yearning to possess a portion of its
caudal appendage, and her gallant
escort commanded the chauffeur to sat
ify her desire. The boy 6ald he had
been engaged to steer the machine, not
to denude peacocks of their only
charm, whereupon Mr. Laymance de
clared that he would cheerfully pay
the prevailing market price for what
ever feathers his fair companion might
receive. Then and not till then did the
chauffeur consent to climb the tree.

Such was the offense written in the
complaint sworn to before Police Judge
Cabaaiss by Floyd Free, a youthful
chauffeur, who had Ju^t been pro
nounced guilty of the same misde
meanor and given the alternative of
spending fifty days in jail or paying a
fine of $200. He was arrested early one
morning in Golden Gate Park by Pa
trolmen Dow and Hicks, who caught
him in the act of plucking some tail
"That said J. Walter Laymance did
willfully and unlawfully chase, catch,
injure and destroy, and cause to be
chased, caught, injured and destroyed
a certain bird, to-wit, a peacock."
When a member of the vigilant China
town squad captured Wong Kee aya v great
Mrs. Letha Jost 121^ Oak street, ap-
p eared before Judge Cabaniss as com
plainant against G. G. Unsworth. whom
she accused of disturbing the peace by
attempting to remove doors and win
dows of her dwelling, of which he Is
the lessee. Incidentally she informed
the court that he had stolen some of
her table cutlery, but she would be
satisfied If he were punished for peace
disturbance alone. It was hinted by
the prosecution that Mr. Unsworth's
act was prompted by desire to oust
Mrs. Jost from the house, she being ir
regular in her payments of rental, but
the defense intimated that he was'
simply starting to make some needed
improvements on the property, which
he had a perfect right to do, when she
interfered and had him arrested.
It was at 7:10 o'clock last Monday
morning that the alleged invasion of
the domicile occurred. Mrs. Jost aver
red that Mr. Unsworth's entry was
forceful, and that after throwing her
furniture around he detached an in
terior door from its hinges and chucked
it out o* window. He was still disar
ranging things when she hastened to
inform the police.
John 11. Rayborn, father of the com
plainant, heard Mr. Unsworth say to
her: "Have you got your rent?" and
then declared that he did not have to
show her the authority under which he
had undertaken to wreck her home.
"He also said," Mr. Rayborn testified,
"that he would throw the whole d â d
push out, and he did throw out the
safe, four doors and one window." Mr.
Rayborn also went for police aid. and
when he returned with Sergeant Green
and Patrolman O'Connor the outer
doors were locked, so he clambered
through a window to admit the peace
preservers.
Mrs. Ida Manning of 123 Oak street
visited the Jost residence at 11 o'clock
that same morning and saw "every
thing upset" and the floors covered
with plaster that had been knocked
from the walls, presumably by Mr.
Unsworth.
The defense will be given its Inning
next Monday. Mr. Unsworth resides at
63S McAllister street. !
feared continued incarceration would
terminate her life. Mrs. Moore, whose
thigh was broken by the fall from the
window, remains in hospital, and her
survival of the injury is doubtful. The
women are of advanced age, and they
had been drinking together prior to the
quarrel which resulted so disastrously
to both of them.

SEEKS WRIT OF PROHIBITION. â Attor
ney George D. Collins filed a petition in the
Supreme Court yesterday for a writ of pro
hibition restraining Judge Lawlor from trying
him on the charge of bigamy. It is alleged
In the petition that if an offense was com
mitted it took place outside the State and
would not therefore be within the Jurisdiction
of the local courts. It Is also alleged that
the Grand Jury Is an illegal body on the
ground - that one member is not on , the as
sessment roll \u25a0 and that five ; members did not
hear the evidence upon which the indictment
.was returned against Collins. The court will
probably consider -the matter to-day.

That the neighbors fear the violent
temper of Marks was shown to-day by
tfoelr reluctance to discuss tbe case., but
only one was willing to tell the reason
for this anxiety to avoid the subject.
This was Mrs. F. McDpnough." who
after saying that she did not want to
talk about thÂ« way in which Marks had
treated h.is wife, said:
"Thi* man has often made threats
that he would kill any one who tried
to - interfere witu him,, and has driven
people from Uis front steps and yard
with a gun. and I do not know but that
if he should bear that I had told any
thing about him, tie might try to do me
or some member of my family some
barm in revenge," 1
Mrs. Charles Anderson said:
"There is no doubt that Marks has
treated his wife badly, but I do not be
lieve that he bas.been as bad as has
been reportedl I know that he has
worked all the time, and he has told
me that he was willing to eend his wife
to a hospital, but that she had refused
to go. There is no doubt that he. Is
violent when any one interferes vsrita
him. for UÂ« has several times driven
people away from his plaep with his
gun."
Besides tbe house in which ne liver.
Marks owns two lots in Golden Gate,
all of which are fully paid for. ItÂ«is
reported that both he and bis aged wife
denied themselves the necessities of life
to save the money to purchase this
property.
Mrs. Charles Anderson, who for more
than fourteen years has lived in the
house next to that occupied by Marks
and his w}fe. said to-day that Mrs.
Marks had been ill since the latter part
of. last year, and in all that time the
only care she bad received, besides that
of her husband, had been rendered by
the neighbors, Mrs. Anderson's state
ment was corroborated by Mrs. F. Mc-
Doncugh, residing at 247 Hannah
street, and Mrs. I. Wall, who lives at
2SB Hannah street, both of whom have
often aided Mrs. Anderson in caring for
Mrs. Marks.
. NEIGHBORS FEAR VIOLENCE.
"1 am going to stay at home all day
te-morrow, and the first one who tries
to enter this house will be filled full
of lead, so you had better look out."
The visit of the secretary evidently
frightened the husband, for hÂ« sent for
Dr. Frank L. Adams this morning be
fore going to work, and then gave the
keys of his. home to Mrs. Anderson, that
she might admit the physician. Be
fore leaving the house he made an ef
fort to remove some of the evidence
of his neglect, but in spite of his care
everything within, the dwelling shows
that it has been used for years rather
as a storehouse than as a human habi
tation. Dirt and sciualor were on every
Bide, and the furniture is piled up in
heaps in every room except the kitchen
and the bedroom occupied by Mrs.
MarK* - Dr. Adams found tha woman
almost in a, dying condition from the
effects of .sickness and privation, and
said that even with tbe best of care
she woul<J 'not live more than three
months at the most.
When the secretary entered the
dwelling, she found the object of her
search lying in bed. too weak to speak
alx>ve a whisper, and the only food in
fight was a dry crust on a table within
roacb of her hand. Shocked at the con
dition of the woman, who is near
ly seventy years old. Miss Whitney told
the husband that such treatment of his
wife would ho longer be permitted, and
informed him that she would at once.
s**Â»d a physician to attend the sick
woman. Without making any answer
to the reproach of the secretary, Marks
asked her to follow him into another
room of the dwelling, and leading the
way Into the kitchen, lie pointed to two
heavy rfles and a. shotgun standing be
hind the stove, and said:
"Just let any one try to come into
"this house unless I ask them to. and
tliuy will get a. dose of lead from those,
and if that isn't, enough I'll use this,"
and opening a trunk in the room he
displayed a loaded revolver.
The man's threat was heard by Mrs.
Anderson, who had followed Miss Whit
ney into the house, and she once more
warned the secretary to, be careful.
Realizing that she was 'powerless to
deal with Marks unaided. Miss Whitney
left the house. Marks saying as sho
went down the steps:
TURBATS ARC MADE.
FOI.M) m\rVl>G WOMAX.
OAKLAND, Juno 23. â Slowly starving
to death because Bhe is too weak to
prepare her own food, and neglected,
it Is cbarged, by a husband who has
often declared that h<Â» would kill any
one who dared to interfere with him
in the management of his domestic af
fairs, Mrs. Mary Marks, the wife of
James Marks, an employe at the Jud
pori Iron Works, residing 1 at 241 Han
nah street, wsÂ« found last night by
Miss C. Anita Whitney, the secretary
of the. Associated Charities, lying help
less !n her home, with only a crust of
dry bread to satisfy the pangs of
hunger until her huslÂ»an& should come
horn,e. from his work.
Miss Whitney's attention had been
called to the case by some of the neigh
bors, who feared that Mrs. Marks
would die of starvation If left any
longer in charge of her husband, and
investigation proved that these fears
were well grounded. When the.secre
tary arrive^ at the liouse, she found all
the doors locked, and the back yard
guarded by a largo and savage dog.
While sho was at the house of one of
the neighbors, where she learned that
Marks had been absent since an early
Jx>ur in the morning", the man whom
Bhe sought returned from his work, and
entered the house. Miss Whitney at
one* summoned him to the door, and
telling him that she was a friend of his
wife, induced him to allow her to enter.
She had been warned by Mrs. Charles
Anderson, who lives at 243 Hannah
street, to be cautious in her dealings
with Marks, as he had often made
threats to do harm to any one who
dared to interfere with him.

AliE WELL ENTERTAINED
HAVE COURTESY
OF THE NATION
The German fourth-class cruiser
Falke, Captain Behncke, which has
been cruising In leisurely manner
along the South and Central American
coasts, arrived here yesterday after
noon and will remain in the harbor for
about tyro weeks. She is on her way
to Alaska. This is the tirst time in
seven years that a ship of the Kaiser's
navy has dropped anchor inside the
Golden Gate. The authorities at Wash
ington are anxious to show the visitor
every courtesy. Th.c ships of the Pa
cific squadron are away, but the War
Department has requested the army
representatives here to play host for
Uncle Sam and to give the Germans a
good time during their stay at the
metropolis of the Pacific. And the or
der has been issued to the military of
ficers stationed here that for the next few
weeks "Hoch" must be substituted for
"Here's looking at you." Army poet 3
will be kept under strict surveillance
in order that there may be no jangle
such as was caused by tbe jingle that
resulted from Admiral Coghlan's fam
ous ride on Pegasus.
There is nothing new in the way of
naval architecture about the Falke.
fhe is a clean, trim-looking vessel,
manned by smart looking officers and
a crew of sturdy Teutons. ; The after
noon breeze gave the visitor rather an
inhospitable reception, and as she came
In without a pilot it was with some dif
ficulty that Captain Behncke brought
hjs vessel to anchor. She will move
this morning from off Vallejo street to
a more peaceful anchorage near the
Union Iron Works.
, The Falke was built in IS9I and it is
five years since she last went into com
mission. Four years of that time she
was stationed on the Atlantic. She has
been on the Pacific about twelve
months.
She is a vessel of 1762 tons and can
make about sixteen knots. She carries
elgrht four-inch gruns, five 1%-inch and
four. Maxims. She is equiped with two
torpedo tubes.
Here oncers are: Captain Behncke;
executive*- officer. Lieutenant Command
er Bcndemann; navigator. Lieutenant
Gluer; Lieutenants Gleis, Schroder,
Assman and Callisen; Surg-eon Seiffe.
Engineer Marx and Paymaster Lipp
mann. She carries a crew of 162 men.
The Falke will receive visitors on
board between the hours of 11:30 a. m.
and 2 p. m. and between 5 and 7 p. m.
Martposa Arrives From Tahiti.
The Oceanic Steamship Company's liner
Mariposa, Captain Lawless, which arrived
yesterday from Tahiti, brought twenty-six pas
eongers. '-. every one of whom from now on
will be a committee of one for the. purpose
of enlightening the rest of the world as to
the charms and benefit* that go with thia
trip to the South Seas. Fine weather was
encountered both going and coming, and at
Tahiti climatic conditions were perfect One
of. the passengers remarked as he greeted his
friends at thÂ» gangway: "I took a month
off to go to Tahiti and have added years to
my life. Sounds queer, but it's true. And
the Maripora's all right."
During her stay in port the Mariposa's pas
senger accommodations will be increased to
accommodate the numbers booked for the next
voyage. She leaves here July 1 and will be at
Tahiti for the celebration in the French col
ony of the Fall of the Bastile.
Among the Mariposa's passengers were
Dr. A. Baessler. Mrs. H. Ball, A. Vollraer.
Mtse A. Nelson. Mrs. J. F. Coope. Miss E.
Ball, Mrs. A. Vollmer. H. Schwartz. Mrs. H.

Schooner Academy la Christened.
There was no waste of wine at the chris
tening of the schooner Academy which will
rail to-day for the coast of Mexico on a sci
entific expedition.' When the schooner's name
was changed from Earnest to Academy the
only ceremony attending tbe operation was
the mixing of the paint necessary to obliter
ate the cognomen by which Uncle Sam had
designated the little vessel and to substitute
the selection of her new owners, the Academy
of Sciences. Before she sailed, however, it
was deemed only fitting t*Â» give the schooner
an official christening. This was done \'<s
frday at the Mission-street bulkhead, where
tbe "Academy is lying. Miss Dickie, daughter
of Trustee W. Dickie, recited a poem written
for the occasion by her brother. Senator Per
kins and other trustees Bald a few words, and
then, to quote one of the trustees, "we wasted
no wine in splashing tbe hull of a vessel al
ready in the water, but, like good Californians,
we all went on board and drank her health in
California champagne."
Among thoee who attended the christening
were: President E. J. Molera; secretary, L.
H. Foote: Trustees George W. Dickie. W. H.
Crocker. Senator Perkins and L. M. Loomis.
C. Hart Merriam, head of the biological sur
vey of the Department of Agriculture, was
also there, accompanied by his wife and two
daurhters. .
With tbe exception of the captain, mate and
cook tbe Academy's crew is made up of sci
entists who will help to work the ship to
wherever their researches may take them.
Tbe Academy la provisioned tor an eighteen
months' cruiee.
May Vlalt tbe Dakota.
The Great Northern Steamship Company
kept open bouse yesterday afternoon on board
the b!c liner Dakota, and nearly ten thou
sand people took the opportunity to visit the
vessel, which has the distinction of being
one of the largest ' In the world. Along the
water front from the ferry to Broadway wharf,
where the Dakota is lying, two streams of
humanity poured all the afternoon, and the
big liner was gay for hours with the flutter of
many colored cklrts. The throng on board
was at times uncomfortable,' but the police
kept the people moving, and the visitors saw
aa much of the big thlp aa they could in the
tft-n of oce short afternoon. The Dakota, will
leave for Seattle probably on Sunday.

fixed in mind the different pointrini his
speech by; first drawing! little figures or
pictoriarrepresentations., If part of his
speech ; had !to do , with -/a bridge he
would make" a^ little \ sketch/ of such ' a
structure, or, if with ' Cuba or the i Phil
ippines; he '. would sketch \a v small / map
of these; islands.;- He-; could remember
these little figures or! pictures/:./ When
he rose to, his \u25a0 feet jhe,; could k see) them
in imagination , and ; select! them 5 one /by
one as he proceeded from point to point
in the address," not -having any. note or
manuscript by him >at sail.! J.That! was
the method! best suited to^him. ;

MANY persons complain of. havlngf
a poor memory, and yet.that,fac
'ulty ' can be ; developed as easily
as can the biceps muscle. Nor is/* it
necessary to. go .to any professor of
memory or to ! master any elaborate
Ss'stem in order, to accomplish this re
sult. One does not have to go -to a
grymnasium to strengthen the -arm .or
back. Chopping . wood . or rowing , a

be! cultiyated by "an effort and-" amid
ordinary pursuits. .: .
One man made. the Sunday, service of
his church .serve as a' memory exer
cise. After the service he would enf
deavor to call the: numbers of all. the
hymns sung, > the chapters and verses
of the ! lessons, words of the anthem,
the text and points of the sermon." This
required paying close attention and a
conscious effort to impress these^things
upon his mind;* By, this and. other

BAB A BHARATI, who was vice president for. India at the Bos
ton Peace Congress in 1904, and c who has written" -a book '
called "Krishna: a History of the Universe," /contributes an :
article to Public Opinion in which he is very caustic in his criticism
of American and Western civilization. The paper is to put the
<juery, "What Can the East Teach the West?" and while the writer
holds that the beef-fed brain of the Westerner cannot grasp the
subtleties of the Orient's higher mentality, he endeavors to en
lighten us a little. He deems us to be mainly materialists and thinks
that while physical things make much impression on us, the force;
of the moral and intellectual does not influence us. The thing that
strikes is a material manifestation of power. Togo has awakened
the West to. Oriental power by just such a needed hard physical
blow, and Oyama showed that power exists on land as well as sea.
These stern physical facts give Baba Bharati a. starting point from
which to suggest to the West that there may be other Oriental
powers as surprising but not demonstrable to dull Western intel
ligence as the physical blow.
THis Eastern scholar imagines the West as putting the ques
tion: "Is not our notion of our superiority over, Asiatics a fallacy
after all?" He sees us in the light of his Oriental training as having
the inferiority of lacking high ideals. We are bent as a people/on
material gain and on sensuous pleasure. He says the American
home shows this, or rather, the prevalent absence of high ideals in
home making. He thinks our scientists are the cause of it-^they
are* teaching materialism. He believes we are going the i gait, of
commercialism and physical grandeur which; will climb to a certain
height and. fall, as history has told of such falls for like cause in the
past. He regards the moral power of our church as almost nominal;"
and he informs us that our missionaries sent out to save the souls
of Asiatics are regarded by those they call "heathens 0 as : the/big
gest.jokes, "being studiously kept unconscious of ,the? fact that -if
Christian be that Christian does, then the average Hind,u or Chinese
or Japanese is a born Christian." ;; *
So much for our faults. As for the remedies,' what the East can
teach the West is to develop conscience. To do this \ye must adopt
the East's ideals of life. "First and foremost is the attainment of
harmony in the mind's forces by the daily practice- of .concentration
upon the basic principle of. life, love itself. This canriot.be: induced
without the conviction that life has sprung from love." We are to
study the Vedas and learn that this universe is one whole throbbing
life. He proceeds to explain that Oriental philosophy which West
erns cannot accept, namely," progress by. the .individual soiil,! : through'
the experiences of repeated reincarnations, until a" stage of perfec
tion is reached and it is merged in the absolute. He comes i closest
to Western comprehension when he puts] his exalted iphilosopriyl this
way; that the fatherhood of God argues^the brotherhood; of riot
merely man, but of fall the universe. He; reminds us that to the
Easterner religion is the very breath of his being,- and -that; the for
mulas of daily, conduct he must go through generate, a "faith" and
force of mind which -the Westerner^well /mightenvy."
AS OTHERS SEE US.
This country will not subject the people to oppression by the
railroads nor the railroads to oppression by the Government. But
it will establish, and maintain justice and a square deal for all. A
rude hand cannot 'be thrust into our delicate industrial
at any point without inflicting damage and doing.. harm. to" the Ayhole
system. AH this is perfectly well understood by the President and
his policy means just what he stands for,, a square ..deal for all.
TTj|re is only one kind of real prosperity, and that is general, in
which all have a share, and to secure that is the business of Govern
ment as far as Government can concern itself at all with industrial
conditions. This should be the only purpose of Congress in deal
ing with the railroad question, and as far as the President is con
cerned, that is the policy that will secure his indorsement and noth
ing else will. :
K|O one must mistake a movement for equality, of treatment
\r and cessation of rebates on American railways for an im
* peachment tliroughout of railway policy, for it is not. Trans
portation controls entirely production and consumption. The power
to fix its rates is the power to impoverish the producer or bring
famine to the consumer. Therefore it is a power justly subject to
control by the Government. Rebates are antagonistic to equality
of treatment, and it is the business and proper function. of. the Gov
ernment to prevent inequalities.
* The best statistics on English roads show a freight rate on
minerals of 1.93 cents per ton mile, on merchandise and livestock
of 2.94 cents, on ail commodities of 2.32 cents. On American roads
ihe average on the same classes of freight is 0.58 cents per ton
mile. On German roads lit is 1.42 cents, on French roads 1.55 cents,
on Austrian roads 1.16 cents, on Hungarian roads 1.30 cents.
In 1903 the average passenger rate on American roads was
2.-01 cents per mile; this was an increase, due, it is claimed, to the
transfer of the cheaper passenger rates to the interurban electric
"roads, and not to an actual advance in passenger rates on the steam
- roads. The foreign passenger rates on same classes were, in Eng
land 4 cents, in Germany 3.45 cents. Taking the miles that a laborer
can travel on an average day's wage, the American laborer for a
day's pay can travel 65 miles, the British 35 miles, the German 53
miles, the French 40 miles, the Belgian 36 miles, the Italian 38
miles, the Russian 38 miles, the East Indian 21 miles.
- On American roads the pay of locomotive engineers averages
$4 per day, English $1 62, Belgian $1.01. American firemen get
$2 28 per day, British 91 cents, Belgian 72 cents. During the last
four years American roads have paid for new locomotives, cars and
equipment, $874,000,000. The capitalization of "283,821, miles s of
American railroad track and equipment, depot buildings, etc., : is
$12,794,806,023. The capitalization in 1903 was $61,369 per mile.
The same year it was on English roads $277,474 per mile; on Ger
man roads, $104,725 ; on French roads, $143,053 ; on Russian,
095; on Austrian, $110,475; on Belgian, $167,898. At the; same
lime labor employed in the construction of American roads is paid
from two to four times as much as on foreign roads. Comparing
the division of gross earnings on American roads between labor and
capital, 40 per cent goes to labor and 23 per cent to capital. In
England labor gets 27 per cent and capital 38 per cent. In Germany
the division is equal.
These figures, taken mostly from the reports of the Interstate
Commerce Commission, serve to emphasize the conservative policy
of the President as against the radical policy of Government own
ership effected by partial confiscation. . Trie railroads have the
power of a giant over the prosperity of the people. A conservative
policy of Government supervision means only that they will not be
permitted to use this rxnver like a giant. When conservative super
vision-is conceded and is in operation it will be seen to have been
the best for railroad property, as well as best for the shippers and
the public. Any one who runs amok at the railroads is unwise and
imprudent. Any one who pretends that their offensive use of power
can be prevented only by Government ownership is one who dis
believes in government at all. . ,

FATHER URHAM'S ADVICE.
When the late Dr. Fredric Upham, fa
miliarly known throughout Southern New
England as "Father" â¢ Upham,! was pastor
of ;. â¢ the Matthewsbn ; . Street -\u0084. Episcopal
Church in Providence, R. L, he ; preached
one Sunday j morning on the 'eternal pun
ishment of \u25a0 the wicked, and as :\u25a0 he was
known f or / a rigid orthodox it is safe to
say that the sermon was somewhat
strong.
- As he was about to take a train for
Boston \ the ", next morning a young man
approached him In the station, saying: "I
was : in ~ your ; church f yesterday morning,
Mr.\Upham,' and heard s . that ' hell fire ser
mon of yours.ll want! to tell you I don't
believe a 'word * of ; it. M '- don't - take j any.
stock in ; the idea v that" a â¢ man 'will go to
hell forever for bis * sins in a~ : short life
here." ' \u0084 ;'\u25a0' .'."\u25a0-." ' .â¢_ . .\u25a0 '. /; . ;\..."; \..."
"So you don't believe in future punish
ment' for sin?" \u25a0 asked "Father" Upham.
: "Oh, - well," -'replied the .critic, "I
wouldn't < say i just that. There . may be
punlBhment'for some for aya v time, but the
Great â¢ Father will bring all In .'at last.'.' \u25a0
: "Young man," - said "Father" Upham,
"I haven't time' to argue with you, as
my train is about to ' start, but let me
give you ' Just Ta ; bit of advice. If . you
don't expect to stay in hell more' than ; a
fortnight, - Just : keep \. out."â Boston Her

The ISOS class of the Wilmerding School
of Industrial Arts received diplomas
amid tf.e hearty app ause of schoolmates
and friends yesterday morning. The as
sembly haJl was profusely decorated with
Cowers and school colors. The class,
the largest in the history of the institu
tion, consisted of eleven ooys from the
architectural-drawing. cabinet-making,
1 bricklaying, carpentering and " plumbing
departments.
The architectural branch graduated Abe
Appleton of San Francisco, "William D.
Efe-genhoff of Ventura, Edward J. O'Con
nor of San Francisco, Oliver B. Raoer Jr.
and Ernest F. Reese of Humboldt.
Charles William Heidenrelch was award
ed tha bricfclaying diploma: Jewett M.
Johnson, that for the cabinet-making
course; Herbert I* Belton and William
A. Layers were graduated as masters of
carpentry, and Henry J. Dolclni and Otto
V. Sorcnsen of plumbing.
Tirey I* Ford, former Attorney Gen
eral of thÂ« State and at present the
head of the iaw department of the Unit
ed Railroads, addressed the students as
follows in part:
"It is a privilege to graduate from the
"Wilrperdlng School. Mr. Wilmerding per
formed a gre*at public service when he
endowed this institution. Thus is an in
valuable opportunity placed in the way
of young men. It is in strong contrast
to older conditions, where young men
were compelled to start from the bottom
aiid work up.
"Young men in California are in a place
where the development of Industry will
be far in advance of that of any other
part of the United States or of the world,
because of its natural resources and the
proximity of Asia. Graduates from the
AVilmerding School, upon entering the
world, are equipped with mental ability
and power to use their hands intelli
gently.
"It is up to you. This is the young
man's age. The captains of industry all
started at the bottom, but Wilmerding
etudents are ahead of them inasmuch as
they are equipped in mind and hand.
The captains of industry suffered depri
vations. While using one hand to work
they used the other to hold a book.
Whatever your walk or life, be always
at its head. You must be honest. Be
honest in your work. Ine dishonest man
seldom succeeds. Be brave. Look the
world in the face. You are as good (as
any man. Be - loyal. Above all be a
good citizen. Upon this rests all."
The diplomas were conferred by Ru
dolpli J. Taussig. chairman of the Wil
merding School committee of the board
of ecgenta of the University of Cali
fqruia. Mr. Taussig addressed the stu
dents briefly, saying that the school had
<}one its part and that it now depended
upon the boys whether they would -be
successful.
Following the presentation of the diplo
mas A. Appieton, as the graduate of the
highest standing, received the generous,.
IÂ»r;ze offered by Mr. Taussigâ an order
upon a local firm for a handsome se<of
drawing instruments with which to start
the bright young architect upon his ca
reer.

Slebe and W.- W. Richards fished the
Big in Colusa County recently.
; The water was unusually high, but- the
i sport afforded was first-class, and the re
sults satisfactory. Mr. Mansfield took
one fish on a four and a half ounce Leon
ard rod which tipped the scales at two
and a quarter pounds. The contest be
tween the cleverest and most sportsman
like of flycasters and the gamest of flsh
must have been Interesting. Mr. Everett
took several flsh averaging more than
one pound. Each . member of the party
returns with a well filled creeL - These
trout seem to rise to a big fly like tha
number six better than to^ the ordinary
number ten or twelve fly of the Trucked
or the Big Meadows. A number one spoon
is also a killer for those who fancy that
kind of flshlng. A fortnight hence, when
the water is lower, this stream will af
ford as fine fishing as the most enthu
siastic angler could desire.
James Watt, Del ; Cooper and Colonel
Kellhor have i returned from Ca3tella on
the Upper Sacramento. They report good
fishing with the spoon. -while taa.fly
yields fair sport. * :-\u25a0"" -; '

Trout fishing conditions are unusually
favorable on the big streams at the pres
ent time, and anglers . who are on their
vacations are having excellent sport. The
warm weather which has been belated
this year has developed the insect life
along the streams which makes the fish
change their food. Instead of- the grub
and willow worms at the bottom of the
streams they seek the files and other in
sects at the top. In thek- quest for food
the ., highly colored artificial flies look
good to them until they feel the sting
of the tiny barb.

STREAMS YIELD
FINEST TROUT
FAMILY CLUB
TO PLAY BALL
ROWING CREWS
FULL OF LIFE
Fred Adams played a remarkably good
game on -the - park- courts last Sunday.
His defeat of Baker and Griffin was un
expected and marks him as a player, of
considerable class. In the Griffin-Adams
match foot faults* were called after the
flrsi set. This affected the play "of both
contestants considerably, but particular
ly that of. Griffin. If foot faults are
called at San- Rafael, as they should be,
many of 4lhe players who never, observe
the rule from one year's end to the other,
will find themselves up against it. It is
to be hoped the -scorer will enforce this
rule, as otherwise: it increases the serv
er's advantage, which is a' big one.'
Miss Hazel Hotchkiss, the present
champion, is in Englanc and a new State
champion will be developed. The tourna
ment will be devoid of class this year
| and the title will in all probability go to
a player of the second or, third class.
The final match of the ladles'^ tournament
will be played on the morning of July 4,
and the men's finals on the afternoon of
the same day.
Three tournaments will be played on
the courts to-day and to-morrow. On the
park courts this morning two events will
be run off." They are the tirst annual
tournament for the Grammar, School
championship and a ladies' handicap dou
bles for the Olds Cups. Of five
teams entered In the latter event three
have won the trophies twice and it is ex
pected one of them will score the third
and final win. The tournament was
scheduled* for to-day in the hope the cups
would be finally disposed of, as many of
the contestants are about to leave town
for the summer. One of them is. going to
Honolulu to live.
The three teams that are tied In the
race for the trophies are Miss Weed and
Miss Van Vllet, Miss Vodden and Miss
Myer and Mrs. \Vattson and Miss Wege
ner. . The drawing favors Miss Wegener
and Mts. Wattson considerably. They
drew in the first round and if successful
will probably meet one of .the other two
teams in the 'finals. If Miss Weed and
Miss Van Vllet win their preliminary
round match they will be opposed to Miss^
Vodden and Miss Myer in the first
tound. ... *
Eight schools entered players in the^
Grammar School event and it should
prove an interesting one. As most of
the contestants are members .of ~ the
Junior Club, M. McLoughlin, the cham
pion of that' organization, is expected to
win the first. championship. He; has al
ways beaten his elubmates easily and
unless one of the outside players upsets
calculations McLoughlin will carry off
the honors.'. '
A handicap doubles tournament for the
Dhe*ctors' Cups will be played on the
California Club courts to-morrow. . All of
the crack teams of the club will be in
the competition and some good tennisils
anticipated.
Several of the cracks will cross the
bay to-morrow to practice on the San
Rafael courts. '.;\u25a0â¢ ;
While the tournament will start on
Friday, few matches in the men's tour
nament will be played that day. The
ladies will also meet for the State cham
pionship. Their tournament will be
played on Friday and will probably be
finished down to the finals.
Murdock and Gardner are by no means
the only players with a chance to win.
George Janes, Fred Adams, Clarence
Griffin, Harry Rolfe, Herbert Schmidt,
Charles Foley and Herbert lÂ»ng are a
clever lot of youngsters, and one of the
s<:ven might upset calculations. They are
by no "means outclassed and each has a
chance to win the coveted title.
The fifth annual tennis tournament for
the championship of the State will com
mence en the Hotel Rafael courts at San
Rafael next Friday. The first event of
the kind, 'played In 1901, was won by
George Whitney, who successfully de
fended his title in 1902. Whitney did not
defend in 1503 and was succeeded by
Grant Smith, the \u25a0 tournament-winner.
Last year DrummcJnd MacGavin won the
tournament and defeated Smith in ;the
challenge match. MacGavin will not be
here to defend on the ith of July and v .the
question of who. will be the new cham
pion is the one that is interesting the
local tennis cracks. As neither Whitney,
Smith nor MacGavin will -be among the
contestants the title will go to a player
who. has never. before held it.
Percy Murdock. the Alameda County
crack, is the only veteran \entered and,
although ne lost the San Francisco
championship to Gardner on" May 30, the
majority. expect to see him carry off the
honors. ., Gardner has also entered and is
consideied Â»"Murdock's most dangerous
rival. Murdock will be in better shape
than he was in the last tournament' and
will not be bothered by the wind. Gard
ner will also be playing a stronger game
than he did in the last .tournament. He
is improving constantly and has come to
the front with a rush. Quite a number
of the entnusiasts are confident Gardner
will again defeat Murdock. The latter
is an unreliable player, while Gardner is
steady and can always be depended upon.
Murdock has unquestionably played ten
nia that outclasses Gardner's best game,
but he probably does not average up any
better than the latter. In . a practice
game on Tuesday Murdock defeated
Gardner easily, taking four sets out of
live.
The Grand Circuit is Just a month off.
It will open on July 24 at Detroit,
which Is always one of the most suc
cessful meetings beldlduring the year.
Following Detroit comes Cleveland,
with 327.000 hung up for racing at the
historic Glenvllle track. Buffalo comes
next, and so as not to be outdone by
any other meeting, offers the magnifi
cent sum of $37,000 in purses. The
week following Buffalo was refused by
the Empire track people and Pough
keepsie will step Into the breach. The
order of towns is then as follows:
Ileadvllle. August 21-25; Providence.
August 28 to September 1; Hartford,
September 4-8; Syracuse, September
4i-15: Columbus, September 18-22;
Cincinnati. September 25-29, and Mem
phis, October IC-26.
There will be good' purses to race for
over at Missoula, Mont., In September.
Four 11000 stakes are offered for trot
ters and pacers. Entries close July 10.
California owners who race at home
this year will have time to ship to
Montana after the State Fair at Sac
ramento closes and race their horses at
MJssoula. There will be several weeks
of good racing at other points tn Mon
tana and Idaho.
The directors of the Pacific Coast
Trotting Horse Breeders' Association
will meet at the office of the secretary
next Tuesday to decide upon the place
to hold the August race meeting of the
association. Propositions have . been
received from both Santa Rosa and
San Jose.
The showing made by the James
Madison mare Confier.za. which won
her race, the 2:20 trot, in straight
heats, gives evidence that she will fulr
fill the promise of her three-year-old
form when she was expected to be a
coming champion. She got out of sorts,
however, and has failed to be much of
a money winner for her owner. Edward
Gaylord, the popular Denver sportsman.
Her new record made in this race is
2:14 4. She is yet several seconds be
hind the mark of her full sister Tuna,
2 :os \i. the fastest four-year-old trotter
last season, which is owned by J. de la
Montanyu of this city.
A wonderfully fast mile for a green
horse to pace was made at Pleasanton
last Saturday by C. L. Griffith's five
year-old stallion Bonnie Steinway.
This young horse has never been reg
ularly trained until with the past two
rronths. He was worked some last fall,
however. On Saturday last he paced
a mile in 2:OS, the first half in 1:05%
and the last half In l:o2>i- Bonnie
Steinway, as his name indicates, was
t-i:-fd by John R. Boyd's stallion Stein
way, which died a few months ago.
His dam is Bon Bon, the $10.00.0 mare,
which produced Bonnie Direct ( 2:os hi)
and Bonsilene <2:14Â« i- Mr. Griffith
will race Bonle Steinway on the Grand
Circuit next year in all probability.
The popular and conservative rÂ«ins
'man, Ed Geers. does not expect to see
any horse beat Lou Dillon's record in
his lifetime. Â»lle is quoted by the Mem
phis correspondent of a Cluveland
paper as saying: "I do not believe I will
Â«?ver live to see such another wonder
ful mile as Lou Dillon stepped when
she took her record."
This does not mean that Mr. Geers
thinks the limit of trotting spÂ»jed has
been reached, but that it will take a
longer trme than he expects to remain
on earth to produce a horse that can
beat 1:58%. and that Is the general
opinion amon? horsemen, as Lou Dil
lon Is a wonder.
There are an even dozen swift side
wheelers named In this event. More
than half of them have shown better
than 2:15 in their work, while the
others are almost unknown quantities,
having been in training back "in the
bushes." Touts and railbirds are un
able to exist there and consequently the
speed of a horse is known only to his
trainer. Among those known to have
"in the money speed" are J. D. Spring
er's Argyle, which has worked a mile
in 2:09 *i; E. A. Servis' Dr. J., which
reeled off a mile in 2:12 recently: Wal
ter Trefry"s Little Joe, which paced in
2:14 in his work last year, but has
never started; Cresco Wilkes, a young
son of JCutwood Wilkes/ which took a
three-year-old record of 2:17 last year
and is expected to pace into the 2:10
list this season; Frank Wright's Pearl
Sinclair, a green mare which is a half
sister to his fast pacer Kelly Briggs,
"rOS I,*,1 ,*, and Nellie R. a mare bred at
liureka, Humboldt County, and owned
by Joseph Long. There is not one of
the foregoing but can pace a mile bet
ter than 2:12, yet the owners of the
others believe they can beat them, so
the race should be a corker, especially
as the purse is the largest of the meet
ing.
Some fast trotting and pacing have
been done at Overland Park track.
Denver, since the meeting opened there
last Saturday. As predicted in these
columns the pacer Harold D by Dex
ter Prince won the tirst facing race of
the meeting. He did not have to beat
2:18 to secure first money, 'and this
must have been *>asy for him as he
worked miles in 2:12 at Pleasanton be
fore he was , shipped to the Colorado
track. v
An average of a little more than nine
entries to each race makes the Fresno
programme of harness racing for the
Breeders' meeting, which opens there
July IS. have a healthy look. The best
race on the programme from the stand
point of a contest with fast heats and
the winner hard to guess is the Kaisin
City Stake of $1500 for pacers of the
2:20 class.

Amateur boxing: promoted for Private
gain is dyins of inanition. A handful
of spectators went to Woodward*B*Pa
vilion last night to see a bunch of bush
amateurs in four- round bouts, manr
aged by the Hawthorne Clulj. .. Seven
fights were carded, but the managers
of the club bunkoed the spec
tators out of the promised star
j event of the night, the . Stan
i ton-McLaughlin affair. The spectators
! responded with volley after volley of
-hisses. The crowd left the place- vow
ing - never to give the management/ a
chance to bunko them again.
The rights were of the uncouth order,
as hardly any of the boys could box.
Billy Christie, the rough-house kid from
San Mateo, hammered- and rushed
Jimmy McClalr around the ring for four
rounds and earned the verdict. Christie
knows nothing about the game.- whil*
McClair Is as foul ~ a fighter as ever
donned a mit. The go was nothing but
a clumsy: mix-up of fists, both men
wrestling and lugging about thÂ« ring
while the mill was on.
Joe Leahy picked up a little easy
money In beating Dick Murray.* The
latter would wade into. Leahy's straight
left continually and had; no 'chance ~to
win.' He started to mix in the : third
round, but Leahy beat 'him at that
game also. Frank Fl o res â¢' made Joe
White quit in two rounds. Flores c has
a way of 'sticking' his right and left out,
and 'White, after running up against
his opponent' 3 fists a few times, went
to the carpet and stayed there patiently
till he was sure all was over/
Jack Rodney "was declared the win-,
ncr over Bob Ritchie in four long
drawn'out and tedious rounds. Nettner
man knew ' how ,to fight and Rodney
-won '\u25a0 simpXy " because he v made ' * more
passes \ than his "opponent.. Tom WII.
llams. â¢\u25a0: a lanky lightweight.; earned the
verdict over; Tommy Ryan, a Sharkey^
like ; youth, ,who: fought himself out In
three rounds. Ryan ; had Williams all
but counted out In the first, two rounds.
\u25a0 but the ' tall : youth began ?. to use a little
strategy and easily won.' Jack Murphy,
a (wee- bantam, "waded In and knocked
\u25a0 out Eddie Duffey in the 'curtain-raiser

"la every large city," said Mr. Harri
son, "public gymnasiums have been es
tablished with success. Boston has
seven, Chicago 15, and New York, Phil
adelphia and Baltimore hare them. I
Eue&*Â« that when the city purchases
playgrounds there be built a gymnasium
thereon. I would empiiaslze the fact
that this proposition Is for the boys who
would thus be taken off the streets and
be made good citizens."
Supervisor Braunhart stated that the
unused portion of the money available
for the perch&se of playground sites
could be utilized for gymnasiums. This
applies especially to the North Beach
playground, the appropriation for which
is. largely in excess of the actual value
of the property to be acquired. The com
inittee advised Mr. Harrison to file , a
petition on the subject with the Board of
Supervisors.
Wiliiam Greer Harrison, president' -of
the Olj-mpic Club, appeared before the
Supervisors Joint Committee on Finance
and Utilities yesterday and. urged that
provision be .made for the establishment
of public gyranasfems In connection with
the children's playgrounds proposed to be
constructed -under the " oond Issue. ' :

along far two hours and a half, with the
Tvind blowing at a higher averajre than
Truck Eagan ever batted. The Seals
cowld make all kinds of hits, but the runs
never came through for some reason, or
other, mostly bad work and dummy plays
with men on bases.
The game might have been broken uy
in half Lh# time but for a bad decision
by Mr. Davis,- and a worse error by
Wheeler. Davis* ruling in the sixth was
absolutely the limit. Spencer started the.
round. with a double sack"er and stole
third. Waldron scored him with a souse
lÂ»*s=t short and Wheeler walked. HUde
brand laid down a bunt which Goodwin
raided to thlr"d. The fans nearly "dropped

Then in the seventh. Brasheer lined out
a clean single to left center, which Hilde
t>rand scooped on the first bounce. Again
I*avis" glimmers failed him and he called
Brash out. Of course, the Angels made
an outcry at this ruling, and tbe fans ail
felt hurt, because they thought they were
'.- .r.i: busked.
The game passed the nmth and tenth
round stages and entered upon the elev

wide ones at Hildebrand when Cap.

Hitt- pitched good enough ball to win a
game for anybody, but had neither luck

passed ten men. The Seals might have
wen the game in an inning had they
bunted, for the butfber could not field a

. Prince Henry of Prussia with Allison V.
"Armour on board was to have sailed the
Orion over a 33-mile course with no com
petitor In, her class. The Ailsa. although
not regularly entered, was invited to, sail
against the Orion and the representative
of the A lisa's owner did so. The All'sa
crossed , the line too soon, had to come
back, and did something, frequent
enousrh in America, but which _gave the
Judges a scare. She made a turn around
the starter' 3 boat, almost touching her
spars and came up to windward. \ In the
meantime the Orion was getting away
fast. The Allsa' at the first turn was
two minutes behind. At the second turn
she* was about even and at the third turn
was fifty seconds ahead. She finished
one minute and ten seconds ahead of the
Orion. .â¢ â l
The Emperor's Meteor 111 was a min
ute behind the Hamburg at the start and
was thirty-four seconds behind at the
first stake boat. She passed the Ham
burg near \u25a0 the second turn, was \u25a0 one
minute and fifty-four seconds ahead^at
tfie last turn and finished something over
three minutes ahead, or one minute and
two seconds corrected time.
â¢ Emperor -William was at the wheel, of
the Meteor 111 much of. the time and was
In good humor. . He, had Emfcassador
Tower, Wilson Marshall, owner of .the
yacht Atlantic, and George Lauder.
owner of the yacht Endymlon. who were
among his guests on board the yacht,
hauling on ropes and assisting in trim
ming sails.
The Meteor 111 has been sharpened at
both ends and her keel has been deep
ened ! Â«lnce last season, with the object
of Increasing her speed. Some of the
English crew, who have sailed* In her
both before and since, said they did not
believe the alterations had helped her,
and' that is understood to be Skipper
Barker's opinion. But others regarded
the Meteor Hi's performance to-day as
rather better than her previous work.
' The Ameiican-bullt Navahoe beat the
Comet over the same '33-mile course by
thirty-one minutes.
The schooner yachts Suzanne- ana
Clara, owned respectively by O-^Huld
schinsky and Max Gullleaume. . had ;. a
luffing match all the way. They were
practically even alHthe time, the Suzanne
winning by scarcely more than ten feet

came In third. Time. 4:13:45: course, 22

to tha dlsposkicn to take profits In stocks, which
have led the previous advance with the advan
tage offered by pushing up new stocks to euÂ»
taln the market. The rotation through the list
was also Ictb complete than yesterday. . The
day's gains as a consequence are lets widely
distributed and "the high prlceÂ« of the day were
less evenly maintained. The weight of selling
to realire eeems to enow a progressive Increase
the further prices advance and proved lessr easy
to absorb to-day than* heretofore. The con
ductors of the movement, however, showed con
siderable confidence In taking over the stocks
made necessary In order to hold the .advanced
level of prices an& were evidently disposed to
proceed m-lta th<i movement. It was said that
there were cases where selling orders, placed
above the market had been withdrawn, owing
to the better feeling inspired by the upward
movement. Obstacles of this nature are neces
sarily met In suo-ting a market out of the pro-,
loured Inertia wfeich has served to discourage
f-peculatire lor.g holders and . to make them
watchful for the first opportunity to get out
and E*ve a loss. The withdrawal of such or
ders is evidence of tbe success which Is -designe-l
by a professional and manipulative movement,
euch ac The prefect haÂ« been to Incite inception.
The same spirit which dlseuades present holders
from selling their stocks Is expected to "lead
new buyers to ccme Into the market. New
buyers thus far have 'not made their presence
coEopicaoui. The selling for London account
was a special burden to-day, tbe foreign-mar
kets feeing unsettled by renÂ«we4 anxiety wer
the Moroccan situation. Operators in stock*,
however, showed tbe same -disposition to ignore
unfavorable factors as for several days paat.
The prospect or criminal. MIU la the Equitable
Life aSalr was cited even as belpful to the
market, owing to the thorough going nature of
tbe reform thus indicated. Both Uie wheat and
corn markets were d<Â»cidÂ©dly unsettled by re
ports of conditions against the crops. Never
theless tbe granger etocks were prominent In
the day's advances and were resorted to In thÂ»
ehlftlng of the Pennsylvania group, in which
there was selltufr to realize on yesterday's ad
\-ance. Tbe market showed some of 3ts former
**risltlvecess to the reiteratlcn of the Presi
dent's views on control and regulation of cor
porations contained In his speeches yesterday.'
The deiasnd lor the Pacifies was accompanied.
by renewed rumors of a coming dividend on
Soutfce*x ~Â«r:flc. The principal buyer cf the
etock pArciklmed his willingness to wager large
turns as to the early declaration of a dividend,
but no official information -on the subject was
to l>e bafl. The week's currency movement has
resulted in a large accumulation here, eed
mates running as high as $7.Ow).O00, Including
routine exchanges with the Interior, transfers
through, the nib-treasury from San FrancJsco

The New York circular of Henry Clews says:
"'Turning to the more Immediate Influences,
\u2666'c find a Jecifiei2!y favorable harvest promise
for both winter *nd fprtng wheat. The Gov
ernment report, eijonlng tse \u25a0 condition as of
Jur.e 1. is -figured by experienced trade etatisti
claxjs as Indicating a totai yield of 727,432,000
bushels, or 175,000.000 bushels in excess of the
â¢mount harvested last year. Ebould thit prom
ise t* taalatained unUl harvestâ and the
chances are It will be somewhat modifiedâ this
5 will give the lar(?ert yield ever turned out by
American wheat fields with the one single ex
ception ef the harvest of 1901â746,460,000 bush
els. The Government makes no estimate cf the
acreage or condition cf corn until its July re
rÂ«rt. but th* present outlook la certainly not as
tavorabio aa in the ease of wheat, there being
very general complaint of late planting and In
sufficient heat tor germination, which will
rr.sKe early froEts as Important factor In the '
vltimare production. It seems safe to assume
that official aad other reports concerning the
progress of com will become increasingly im
portant .as a etock marEet factor during the
tiext few weeks.
"The (J ecu ion by Secretary Shaw to defer un
til July IS his call upon banks throughout the
country for Goi-ernmertt deposits has delayed a
moderate adverse lnfiuene* over the money
rltuatlon. la all. undT the current call. New
York backs will T*y about 112,000,000 over to
the Governmect; but es the July disbursements
viil In large measure nave returned to circula
tion fey the middle of the month the with
drawal of Government funds should be made
without substantial influence on the basking
situati'ia. Tbe present outlook seems one for
lavorable prices, and consequently a good trad
ers" market; and en important factor that
should not . be lost sicht of Is that we have
now reached tbe eeaaca when professional op
tratore usually purchase etandard investment
stocks for thevpurpose cf selling them when
the Ist of July dividend and Interest disburse
ments eater the market ror re-employment.
These payments are largest in January and
Ju!y. "and quite frequently prove the wisdom
ef anticipatory purchases made for the express
purpose of supplying this usual eeml-enmiÂ«l
demand." . ' . . ... 51 . 181 l Ml Ifill ITT]

â¢ This company proposes to ' put \u25a0in an up-to
date nlant and ; to construct conduits. Poles
will be used in the outlying districts only. It
has been . frequently stated that the Horn?
Company 'would sell out.. That is why it has
put a clause in- tlw franchise binding itself not
to sell out. \u25a0 If will always maintain a com

Brooding over an expected separation
from her husband. Mrs. Ida Munford.
wile of a chauffeur, sent a pistol bullet
through her heart yesterday. John Mun
ford. the husband, who had left her only
an hour before, returned to find his young
and pretty wife still in death.
As he entered the dimly-lighted room
where he had left her sleeping peace
fully he called to her softly. There was
no reply. He walked up to the bed and
shook her gently. She did not stir. In
terror he tried to raise her and called her
name. But her voice was stilled . forever.
She had fired a bullet into her breast
and death must have come instantly.
The pistol lay beside her on the bed.
The husband had left their home at
1416 Post street shortly before 10 o'clock
yesterday morning. Munford. who is
chauffeur for James D. Phelan. was to
have gone to Europe with his employer.
He left his wife, Intending to make prep
arations for his departure. The wife was
to remain with her parents until his re
turn.
The husband und his younp wife were
decj.ly attacliod to each other and grief
over the coming separation is supposed to
have unbalanced her mind. They were a
model young couple according to all who
knew them.
A few days ngo Munford found a bottle
of chloroform in his wife's possession. He
asked her what she had the stuff for,
but she passed the subject off in a jest.
He dues not know where she got the re
volver. ' He is certain that he never had
one or saw one in the house. It is an
old and rusty weapon, but she must have
purchased it recently.
It was ascertained that there has been
insanity in Mrs. Munford's family for
several generations. An "nele of hers
