Â» BAN DIEGO, July 23. â In a. great
trench, on the eastern slope of Point
Loraa, overlooking the blue, waters of
Sari Diego Bay. the nation has buried its
sailor dead. On the summit of a sun
kissed peninsula 400 feet above the sea,
two score and seven new-made coffins
are sepulchcred to-night. Two score
and seven graves beneath one giant
mound, decked with withering flowers,
beneath the solemn stars, the Ben
nington dead are at restâ dreamless
their slumber, perfect their peace. The
wails of the anguished, sobs of the
broken-hearted and bereaved, are hush
ed from their ears forever more;' no
hymn of funeral surf or starlight winds
adds aught to their repose; the flag is
their winding sheet, beneath the sod.
If simplicity is the emblem of a na
tion's grief, then, indeed, are they re
gretted. No pomp of circumstance
marked their burial path. Sorrow en
shrouded, but of melancholy grandeur
there was none. No soldier guard, no
roll of muffled drum or mournful dirge,
wont with them across the funeral hills.
Dutt took the place of glitter and for
music thero was the creak of endless
wheels. True, some soldiers and sailors
went with them out of town; true,- a
hollow square of these faced the gaping
trench. But from the city's gates to the
great grave on the distant slope they
.iourneyed unattended, in rude cofllns
stacked one upon another on dras"s, fol
lowed and pressed upon by half a mile
of varied vehicles filled with sorrowing
civilians.
It was the wish of the commander of
the Bcnuington that a spirit of simplicity
should govern the obsequies. With a
llteralness verging on shabblness this
wish .was carried out. Tenders of bands
of music by tbe Mayor of the city were
by Captain Young declined. The'opera
house was offered for a subllc service
and declined.
Hearses could not undertake ; the nlne
raile drive to the. lofty cemetery grounds,
because of the evil condition of the road.
It was deemed proper not to require the
Bennlngrton survivors or the naval re
serves or the Fort Rosecrans artillery
"men to tramp that weary distance.. and
vans to convey them \u25a0were not requisi
tioned. So forty-nine of the heroic vic
tims of one of the most deplorable. Â«J is-,

DANIEL LAMONT
DIES SUDDENLY
Former Secretary of War
Stricken by Heart Failure
at His Millbrook Home
ILL OXLY A HALF HOUR
Seemingly in the Best of
Health Until Just Before
the Unexpected Attack
6j>eclal Dispatch to The C*lL
POUGHKEEPSIE. N, V., July 23.-
Daniel Scott Lamont, Secretary of War
during the second administration of
President Cleveland, died suddenly at his
home at illllbrook. Duchess County, to
night at 9:15 o'clock. Heart failure was
the cause of death.
Mr. and Mrs. Lamont were out driving
this afternoon and Mr. Lamont appeared
to be enjoying the best of health. After
dinner he comitlained of feeling ill, and
Dr. Stewart, of New York, who is a
guest at the house, immediately went to
his aid. The physician diagnosed the
case as an attack of heart failure, and
in sr>lte of heroic treatment, Lamont
passed away within a half-hour. At his
deathbed were Mrs. Lamont and two
daughters, Frances and Bessie. Several
guests at the Lamont home were also
present when the end came.
NEW YORK. July 23â Nothing but the
bare announcement of Mr. Lamont's
death was made public by the family
to-night, and this was contained in a
brief press message. Intelligence of the
approaching death of Mr. Lamont was
sent earlier in the evening to Dr. Joseph
D. Bryant, of New York, a lifelong friend
of Mr. Lamont, and summoning the phy
sician to Mlllbrook. Dr. Bryant had been
called out of town for the night, how
ever, and could not be reached by Mrs.
Bryant, who later received a second mes
eage announcing Mr. Lamont's death.
Mr. Lamont was vice-president of" the
Northern Pacific Railroad and a director
and trustee in many railroad and finan
cial corporations. He is survived by a
widow and two daughters. He was a
member Of many New York clubs.
NORTH SANDWICK, N. H.. July 24.â
When informed early to-day of the death
of former Secretary of War Daniel S.
Lamom, former President Cleveland, who
is spending the summer at his country
home here, was deeply affected. Mr.
Cleveland said:
"No death outside the circle of my own
family could have affected me more. My
relation to the dead man. in public sta
tion and in private life and in the most
affectionate friendship, taught me to
know him as an able, conscientious and
true man."
Daniel Scott Lamont was born at Mc-
Grawville. Courtland County. N. V., on
February 1!Â». ISSI. He came of Scotch-
Irish ancestry, who emigrated to this
country and became farmers. His father
was successful and the boy, after study
ing at the normal college of his home
town, was sent to Union College. Sche
nectady, but did not graduate. He left
college to take tip newspaper work, for
which he had both an inclination and
talent. He purchased an interest in the
Democrat, a paper published in the
county teat of Curtlandt County, and be
came its editor, at the same time inter
esting himpeif In politics. \u25a0
In ISTO he was appointed engrossing
clerk of the New York State Assembly
and was chief cleric in the office of the
Secretary of State with John Blgelow.
For a time he held a position on the staff
of the Albany Argus and he thus became
well known to many of the most in
fluential politicians of the State.
When Grover Cleveland was elected
Governor of New York he met young
Lamont. and having had occasion to use
his knowledge and ability in the prepar
ation of his fir?t message, offered him an
honorary position on his military staff,
\u25a0which gave him the title of colonel.
Governor Cleveland next appointed Mr.
Lamont l-.is private secretary, in which
position the latter made himself po useful
that when Mr. Cleveland became Presi
dent he took Mr. Lamont with him to
the White House. '
At the beginning of the second Cleve
land administration. In March, 1893, La
mont was appointed Secretary of War,
"giving up extensive interests to serve in
"that position. At the request of William
C. Whitney he had gone Into the Metro
politan Traction Company in 1889. He
served through the second Cleveland ad
ministration as head of the War Depart
ment.
Mr. Lamond married Miss Julia Kenney
â¢of Courtland. N. V.. in 1871. Three chil
dren were born of the union.

When you feel languid, tired)
nervous and irritable, your vi-
tality is low â -your supply of
nerve energy exhausted, â¢ and
your system running down for
lack of power,
The organs of the body are
working poorly, or not at all,
and you are not getting the
nourishment needed. This soon
impoverishes the blood and in-
stead of throwing off the im-
purilies, distributes it all
through the body. This brings
disease and misery.
Feed the nerves with Dr.
Miles' Nervine, a nerve food, a
nerve medicine, that nourishes
and strengthens the nerves, and
see how quickly you will get
strong and vigorous.
"lly wife suffered \rlth nervousness
previous to a recent attack of typhoid
fever, but after her recovery from the
fever, ehÂ© was much worse, and could
hardly control herself being: exceed-
ingly nervous when tho least excited.
She xras very restless at night, and
never red a cood nicht's rest. She
r.Jso suffered much from nervous head-
aoke. Dr. Miles' Nervine was "recom-
mended by a friend. After the first
three dose* rhe had a good night's
rest, and at the end of the first week's
treatment ehc "was wonderfully im-
proved. Continued use of Nervine. has
completed her entire cure."

of them different from the rest. . On each
oblong, stained pine box was fastened a
wreath of flowers, offerings from the San
Diego Chamber of Commerce. Over each
somber drayload a huge 'American flag
was flung. On â¢ the high seat of each
wagon beside the driver sat an under
taker's- attendant, his lap and : arras
heaped with brilliant flowers. '
J Precisely at the hour of noon the
I strange- procession* set out from j; the
sunny plaza. At every cross street^ as
it wound its way with measured pace
through the" little seaside ,cfty, vehicles
of almost every sort, from the natty
"turnout" of private stables down
through, the unassorted rigs of public
liveries *to the antiouated : carryall of the
farming class fell "in behind, until when
the hills outside the town were reached
the cortege had. grown to the half of a
, mile in length, moving silently in an
I unending curtain of dust, -beaten Upon by
; the rays of a mid July sun.
At the city limits the Bennington sur
vivors, fifty-two in number, with nine
tars from the government tug Fashion,
all jinder command of Ensign "Lacey and
the* men of the 115 th company of coast
artillery from Fort Rosecrans, led by
Commandant Scott, and the San Diego
Naval Reserves, together iv-Ith Captain
Lucien Young of the 111-rated gunboat.
Captain Drake of Mare Island navy yard;
Captain Rolfe of the coast artillery and
ether army and navy officers turned from
the procession, leaving it to make its way
unescorted to the reservation cemetery.
The men and officers marched to the
wharf.' where the" government launches
and chartered craft took them across the
bay to the Fort, thence to proceed by a
hill-windins road to the bu::al ground on
the heights aboveâ a hot, weary, dust
choked march for all but the officers, but
one whlfih -the men endured with will
ing though heavy hearfs.
A serious road in places is that which
runs nine miles ur> hill and down to the
seaward crest of Loma promontory. The
dust lies ankle deep,' often concealing
chucks that threaten felloes and springs.
Twice or thrice one or another of the
coffin-laden drays stalled oh^ a grade in
these treacherous, sinks. Then above the
silence of hill places sounded .the swish
of a driver's lash as he stood on his
footboard and beat his trembling- horses.
People far behind in the procession
stopped in forced obedience to'the'uni
versal halt, and peering ahead through
the dust drift they -discerned a patch of
bright color, the flowers and a flag, and
towering above it the head and shoulders
of a ; . -driver,-, his arm -rising an/L-tallUig;
powerfully as he plied his merciless whip.
It was cruel and shockingly; discordant,
but there was no other way. . Then the
topmost summit, of . the . nine-mile road
was approached. The whole dust-coated
cortege was halted throughout Its length
by the stopping of the coffin-heaped
trucks at the cemetery gate, much as a
string of freight cars comes to an un
willing standstill, one after another.
The narrowness of the road making It
impossible for. teams to turn out and
drive forward, the people drove ! their
horses Into the brush, hitched them to
the root branches of greasewood clumps,
and themselves trudged the last eighth
of a mile through the heavy brush to
the place of burial. Hundreds of them,
old men, panting women, young men and
girls, and even children, they swarmed
afoot up the hill. .
A whitewashed paling fence encloses
the insignificant burying ground that
does grim duty for the fort 400 feet be
lov. At its gate a private and a sergeant
of artillery stood on guard, the crimson
braid on their blue uniform glaring in
the sun, the polished ; steel of their arms
glinting showily. " . ' .â¢ :
Only certain privileged , persons, such
as friends of officers,' newspaper corre
spondents, staff photographers and some
others, succeeded in meeting favor in the
eyes of the red-trimmed sergeant and
getting by the stiff-backed sentry through
that rate. All others, and there were
very many of them, were turned aside
and ranked themselves four-and five deep
around the outside of the low fencp.. All
heads were bared. -
Then tht paling was a medley of uni
form and of color. In a hollow square
were drawn up at "attention" the fifty
two Bennington survivors, facing north
with a khakled collection of Tingley the
oscphical students In their rear, the men
of the 115 th Coasi Artillery faong east,
the naval reserves facing south. The
east side of the square was open.
Traversing a. portion of the width of. the
little cemetery from east to west was a
great p'.t or trench, perhaps fifteen feet
wide and thjrty long and ten deep, the
grave. From the eastern wall the bottom
of this excavation sloped gradually up
ward to the surface at its western end.
an earthen runway, down which "the liv
ing survivors of the . wrecked . gunboat
would presently bear the encoffined forms
of their dead mates.
At the approach to the literal "pathway
to the grave" were grouped the ' Ben
nington's commander; who wore no sword,
and other navy and army officers, belted,
epauletted. wearing their arms, j One by
one the great drays came thrgugh the
narrow gate, were driven to 'the edge of
the trench and there halted, Jackies from
the Bennington springing 'forward and
clutching the wheels, for there was
danger in that spot of a- sudden overturn-
Ing with all Its dreadful possibilities. â
One by ono the', flower-wreatned
boxes were lifted from their tiers by
sun-bnjn-ned, sinewy hands, with now
a muttered, "Bring her aft, matey," and
now a murmured, "Steady." Then the
coffins were carried by the sailor lads
down the road that has no turnlnsr and
ranged side by 'side in two cverexten<l r
ing parallel rows on the runken earth
en floor. When they . had finished
forty-seven plain brown coffins reposed
evenly in the bottom of the trench. On
the lid of each a square of cardboard
firmly tacked bore the name, .of | its
silent occupant. .' Beneath the lid ,of
each a hermetically sealed glass bottle
contained for future identification the
same. ; v
Forth from the group of uniformed offi
cers stepped the rÂ«ctor of St., Paul's Epis
copal Church, the Rev. "J. A.' M.\ Ritchey,
in his long surplice of white with purple
shoulder- cape, -and, without, further
pause, the reading of the Episcopal burial
service be jan. \
<, With me recitation of its world, old
ending ' "earth" to ' earth; dust * to s^ dust,'
ashes to ashes,",! the minister paced
slowly down : the slanting floor iof the
grave, and having stopped : and stooped,
cast from him a handful of pebbly earth.'

An unearthly rattle came from the depths
of the trench as the-bits of. hard dirt

.The utmost discretion hap been ob

De Witte appears to be satisfied with
Rouvler's assurances that France will
adopt every possible means. to assist

the' French Government with Great

discussed during the conversation at

PITTSBURG. . July 23.â According to
plans which are now being matured, a
general strike of all coal miners in Penn
sylvania, embracing: both the anthracite
and the bituminous fields, will be called
before winter sets in. This action ua3
been, decided upen during the past week
by officials of the United Workers
of America. .
President Patrick Dolan of the Pitts
burg district admitted to-day that a great
ttrike was being planned. The action is
being taken to forestall any action of the
operators in the anthracite region to
force a general lockout. A strike of this
character, according to President Dolan.
would bring out every union miner in the"
State and a number of miners in other
States, who might declare sympathetic
strikes, and would practically cut off the
coal supply of the country.
National Vice President Lewis of the
Mine Workers has been in Pittsburg dur
ing the past week, having been deputized
to come here and act by. President John
Mitchell. The decision to bring out the
bituminous miners was reached after a
consultation with the local leaders, a '
The strike is really a revival of the old
conflict " of several years ago, when the
miners were compelled by the Reading
Railroad to accede to the demands of
the operators. Vice President Lewis said
that if the men kept together, as he ex
pected them to : do, it would mean the
greatest conflict between organized capi
tal and labor that the world has ever
known.
All of the Eastern railroads are erect-
Ing great bins, which will be filled with
coal, in anticipation of the strike.
While the local "officials of , the Mine
Workers are loath to discuss the pro
posed strike, they do not hesitate to ad
mit that they have decided to Join in a
fight with the anthracite miners. Dolan
said to-day:
"The present is hot a time for us to
discuss the matter. We fully appreciate
the fact. However, if the miners ever
get recognition, now is the time that it
must come. The miners are prepared for
a fight, and, with the stockholders of at
least one of the great coal companies
fighting among themselves, we do not see
how we can lose. At least, we are willing
to take a chance with the Western min
ers and do our best to win." ,

GOVERNOR'S AID
FOR A FUGITIVE
Utali ? s .Executive Eefuses
to Issue a Requisition
for John Q. Cannon
WILL NEVER BE TRIED
Alleged Forger Under Arrest
in Northwest Territory
Cannot Be Brought Back
Bseclal Dispatch to ThÂ» C*lJ.
SALT LAKE, July 23.7-Governor John
C. Cutler has refused to issue a requisi
tion for John Q. Cannon, former brigadier
general of the Utah National Guard, who
is now under arrest in Lethbridge. >T. W.
T. The ; application of thÂ« County' At
torney was returned unhonored. with thÂ«
Indorsement that "the interests of tha
State do not demand that the requisition
be issued."
This action by " Governor Cutler has
caused ., little surprise among those fa
miliar with his position and the circum
stances surrounding the present case.
Cannon is a member of a prominent Mor
mon family, the. son of a former Mor
mon - leader and was at one time editor
of the church newspaper; He has some
powerful connections, being related by
marriage to ex-Governor Wells, and has
many blood relatives who occupy influ
ential business positions. Through his
relatives Cannon has been able to bring
strong pressure to bear in his behalf by
Gentile interests, while his religious af
filiations give him a great "church pulL"
The latter connection undoubtedly did
most to help him in the present case.
Since the news of Cannon's arrest a
strong sentiment against bringing him
back for trial has been carefully nurtured
by leading Mormons.
Senator Smoot has been pronounced la
his declaration to the effect that it
"would be better all around" to let Can
non alone. Governor CCutlerr r although he
belongs to a faction that has been fought
by Cannon and his friends, is a devout
Mormon. " ' I ' 'fl 3
It is believed here that this ends the
matter, although the County Attorney
is anxious to bring Cannon to Utah to
face the charge of forgery that stands
against him. Sworn testimony by for
mer Governor "Wells and others before
a legislative committee last February was
to the effect that Cannon had confessed
his guilt to members of the Louisiana
Purchase Commission, of which he was
secretary when the commission's funds
were diverted by means of forged checks.
This - testimony was corroborated by
Cannon's precipitate flight during the In
vestigation and it is believed here, that
his "conviction would be Inevitable If he
were brought within the jurisdiction of
the Utah courts.

woman, 1 who was captured in a raid on
a poolroom for women in Eighth ave

is greatly exercised because she has
been charged with being the backer of
the establishment. She declared with
emphasis, to-night that 'she had noth

there making a bet. I put '5 on Chal

morrow If I got a good tip . and I
vouldn't care a rap for 'all the. police
and detectives; of New York. I gen
erally went to the track, but Brighton
is too far. away for me, so I went'to a
poolroom. I wouldn't have been caught
in the raid if the woman detective
hadn't fooled me.
V'l am sure that my husband paid
that detective to watch me and caused
the raid to humiliate me. If he doesn't
stop saying things about me, I will
-use- Kentucky style on him. I am
strong ' enough to thrash him.. That
woman detective sent me word to come
down .on 4 Saturday, rain or shine, -.as
she had a 'good thing.' and that was
why I was caught- in -the place. I am
suing Mr. Ring to get possession of the
Mount Vernon j Opera-house, valued at

either of these places who desire to at
tend a high school go to San Rafael or
San Francisco. . \ !
\u25a0' r County Superintendent of Schools James
B. Davidson Is strongly in favor of anew
high school in, this district and feels tÃat
it should be built at an early date.. Ac
cording to the school census of this year
Sausallto has 477 *' children. Miss > alley
379 and Reeds nineteen, / a total of 891 1
children in the district. This year Reed
had one -graduate. Sausallto seventeen
and Mill Valley, nineteen. .Next year
Reeds will have three. Sausalito twenty
one and Mill Valley twentjj-slx.
According to these figures. Supenntend
1 ent Davidson says, a feign school accom
modating 150 pupils should be built. The
approximate cost of the building, f ujly
equipped, wouid r be about $20,000 and the
annual cost of maintenance would be
$5000. Of this amount the. State would
contribute $1200 and the district $3SOO.
Davidson advocates a commercial de
partment as well as a ; polytechnic, so
that the boys would be better trained for
their struggle in life.
The Mill Valley Board of Trade will
take the matter up as soon as they hear
from '\u25a0' Sausalito. /It is proposed, also, to
confer with: the railroad people with
regard to securing a low fare for the
pupils. - tfÂ£C*i;K.

PROBLEMS TO COME
v UP AT/EXTRA SESSION
Congress Will Consider Tar
iff, Canal and Railroad ,
. Rates.
Special Dispatch 'to The Call.
\u25a0WASHINGTON, ; JuIy 23.â 1t is stated
in Washington that the purpose \u25a0of the
extra session .is the consideration of
Panama . Canal legislation first, then the
tariff and : the â¢ railroad situation. '. It is
assumed that the decision to have an
extra session followed the visit of Secre
tary' Root to Oyster' Bay. While it is
not at all certain that the : President in
tends to place the Panama Canal work
under â¢ the Department â¢of \u25a0 State, there Is
no doubt that he has consulted Root on
the situation in ; which the administration
finds Itself r respecting the canal. Secre
tary Root Is 'strongly of the opinion 1 that
Congress owes it to the President., to the
country \u25a0 and to the great- work which is
under way .on the isthmus to take tis
share of -the. burden and give the Presi
dent legislation under which he can work
without resorting to" such subterfuges as
he was compelled to adopt in getting rid
of ; the Walker . commission and placing
a governor, a; business man and an en
gineer in : absolute charge.
; As to railroad rate legislation, the gen
eral impression is - that hlt will be im
possible for the President t<> make any
more headway in the new Congress than
he did in r.the last." The railroads have
been working very, hard i and they have
succeeded in enlisting, not only a larsre
number, of â¢ shippers but also , railroad em
ployes, who are becoming convinced that
to lodge in v the hands sof the Interstate
Commerce Commission the power to reeu

OUTING CO3IES TO END
NinthjEncampment Is Voted
One "of the Most Successful
in History of . Organization
Special Disratch to The Call.
j CAMP CULLEN, SANTA CLARA. July
1 23.â The â¢ ninth "encampment of the
Leagtfe of the Cross Cadets Â«nded this
afternoon and at 4 o'clock the members
of the regiment departed for tteir
homes on a special train. The encamp
ment jost ended was one of the most
successful ever held. The attendance
I has been good, the whole eighteen com
panies havlpgr been represented In camp.
Never before has such an orderly body
' of young 'men been In Santa Clara and
; they made many friends during their
stay. The Santa Clara people wlsa they
would come again.
During the encampment not all has
been pleasure. The drills under the su
pervision of Sergeant Henderson of the
United States army were instructive
and did the cadets much. good. . Colonel
power, and his staff conducted- the camp
in true military style. The League of
the- Cross band has been a feature of
the encampment, the daily concerts giv
ing great enjoyment to the people. :
Many cadets came d"own from San
Francisco this morning and accompa
nied their, companies home. There was
also a large number, of visitors at Camp
Cullen to-day. . -
At 9 o'clock this morning Rev. Father
O'Ryan, chaplain of the League of the
Cross Cadets, celebrated military mass
at the old Santa Clara Mission cross, In
front of the college, which was erected
there in 1777. The full regiment was In
attendance. Music wasj furnished by the
band. An altar had been erected near
the cress. A sermon followed the mass.
â¢Aftex dinner at noon a gun gave the
signal tor breaking camp. The tents
were struck with military precision and?
the cadets busied themselves packing
up. --'-\u25a0> - â¢ >
Shortly before ,- their departure the
League of the Cross -Cadets, -headed by
their band, marched through the streets
of Santa Clara and then counter-march
ed to the depot. As the train pulled out
the band played and there was a wav
ing of handkerchiefs by the girls tho
cadets left behind them. .. i
I,auErhcfl and Lost Her Cola.
. Mrs. Elizabeth Rlley, who says she"
works for a family of the name of Le
casse on Woolsey street. West Berke
ley, accused Daniel Burke, a teamster,
and Henry Johnson, a laborer, of rob
bing her. last, night of $5 in gold.' The
woman, who was very much under the
influence of liquor, says she held the
coin in her mouth and that when she'
laughed Burke saw it and seized It.
When she attempted to recover , the
money." Johnson .interfered; and- site
called -Policeman. James .Ward and ..Spe
cial â¢ Daggett. Both -men were taken
into f custody. The robbery is alleged
to .have happened In a Kearny-street
saloon, where all were drinking. .
Badges for Clergymen Advocated.
Not infreqnently we read of an acci

city, where a Roman Catholic priest ap

fort \u25a0' to the stricken or dying. ..It .is
seldo'n? - that wÂ© read of a Protestant
minister in similar . - circumstance?. A
priest will be easily recognized and ' readily
admitted to an injured man. A minister
is not so easily recogmlzed.> -Some may
wear a. cut of clothing : that will con
firm their claims -to be, clergymen; .but
others do not. Why should not Protes
tants ministers who wish to improve ev

themselves with badges, which they can
always wear, though concealed, but which
they can display when the emergency
arises, thus securing access to the cen
ter of a crowd where lies . a " prostrate
man, or to a burning building where

FUNSTON'S AID
IS BADLY HURT
Lieutenant Burton Mitchell
Narrowly Escapes Death
in Accident at Monterey
NOW LIES IN HOSPITAL
General and Both Officers
Leap From Dougherty Con
trolled by Runaway Mules
The accident to General Frederick Fun
ston and his aids at Monterey seems to
have been of far more serious : import
than at first reported. Gene/al Funston
and his aid. Lieutenant E. ,t. Long, re
turned on Saturday evening. ' Lieutenant
tturton J. Mitchell, who was In the acci
dent, was not able to come and is now In
tne hospital at Monterey. Lieutenant
Long, in speaking of the accident, said:
At the time of the smashup General Funston.
Lieutenant Mitchell and myself were return
ing to Hotel del Monte from the small arms
practice at the Presidio of Monterey. We were
In an army doughertj'.' *hlch was being pulled
by two mules. As we arrived at the railroad,
crossir.g jon Alvarado street, ; we noticed an
electric oar approaching. . The car stopped be
fore the crossing and our driver, Morris Smith,
in order to mak-e way for a . team that was
trying to pass, touched up our team to cross
the track. ' -
Apparently the instant that we started the
electric car got under way. Of course, being
in the closed dougherty we could not see its
approach. The car gave us a tremendous
jolt, which threw our driver off from the seat
and about twenty feet across the road. As he.
fell he dropped the lines, and at the same
minute th-e mules broke into a run. Wo
were utterly helpless. When General Funston
saw the plipht that we were in. he gave the
order to jump. General ' Funston , and
Lieutenant Mitchell leaped -, out through
the doors on each side, and landed vio
lently on the roadway. They were rolled t
over and orer before they, finally landed in
some bunches of shrubbery- For a moment I
waited, as being in the front seat I 'thought
there might be a slight possibility of my re
gaining the reins. When I saw that this
was out of the question I juniiÂ«ed myself. The
mules at this time were running at full speed
and occasionally landing a kick. It Is
a great surprise to me that we were not
badly hurt. Of course. General Funston re
ceived a great jar 'when he struck the road.
He, however, fortunately escaped with only
slight bruises to his legs.
\u25a0 Lieutenant Mitchell, however, was badly
hurt and Is now in the hospital at Monterey,
wh->re he will probably be for some time.
When he Jumped from the dougherty he landed
on his right shoulder, which forced his arm
out or its socket. The -impetus of the fall
turned him over; and a protruding rock In the
road struck him a blow in the left eye. He
was also badly scarred on different por
tions of his body, and received several severe
abrasions about the head, though none of them
were of a socially serious nature. . He was
Immediately carried to the hospital. I fortu
nately escaped with only a few trifling bruises
and scratches.

MILITIAIO&'S JOKE
MAY "END FATALLY
Soldier Tossed in Blanket by
Comrades Dying in a
Hospital.
Special Dispatch jto The Call.
PORTXÂ»A^.D, July 23.â Louis Spangler,
a private of Company A, Oregon National
Guard, is unconscious and probably â¢is
dying as the result of his being tossed in
a blanket late to-day by the comrades at
the company camp Just outside of the
exposition grounds. Notwithstanding re
peated orders several members of the
company which was allowed to . remain
here for a few days to attend the fair, on
its way back to: Baker City from a regi
mental camp, were engaged in "tossing"
those of their comrades whom they "could
get hold . of. According to cine of the
members of the company \ Spangler ex
pressed a desire to be "tossed." Ten
militiamen had hold of the blanket; and
after Spangler had been thrown Into the
air several times, ; one of \ the men acci
dentally slipped his hold on the blanket,
allowing Spangler to fall to the ground.
He fell on a projecting root.
He did not move after, striking the
ground and the frightened militiamen
bore him to. the Emergency Hospital,
whence he was taken to -St. Vincent's
Hospital. The physicians state â¢ that
every indication points to his having:
sustained an injury to the base of tho
brain and that while there is a possibil
ity of his recovery, it is very doubtful.

But La Belle Estellita dances, and real

sways through her dance like a Spanish

called the "poetry of motion." :

TRADE CONDITIONS STILL BRIGHT.
\u25a0|â<XTREME heat reduced the volume of business materially
H throughout the Eastern and Western States last week, which
-" probably explains the drop in the bank clearings, which
showed a gain of only 12.8 per cent over the corresponding week
last year, against a recent weekly gain ranging from 25 per cent to
50 per cent. The aggregate clearings also fell off to $2,450,600,000.
The exhibit, however, was very favorable, only six of the fifty. more
important cities and towns showing a loss.
Other figures affirm the current encouraging condition of trade.
The railroad earnings thus far in July are 7.4' per cent larger than
during the same time last year, and the failures last week were only
193, against 231 in 1904. As long as the bank clearings show a
steady gain and the failures a steady decrease, week after week, the
business of the country is all right.
The staples continue quiet and with several exceptions without
especial feature. Persistent reports of black rust in the Northwest
ern wheat States have sent the price of wheat up at Chicago, and
fears that the widespread damage to the crop from this source. last
3'ear are to be repeated this season are prevalent. The damage thus
far, however, is not very serious, and the scare is as yet more one of
dread than of actual occurrence. The possibilities, though, are suf
ficiently grave to send quotations up and create a strong bullish
feeling in speculative and consumptive quarters. The weather
over the cotton belt** on the contrary, has lately improved, which
partially offsets the unfavorable developments in the wheat crop.
The corn crop is stilllooking very well, hence .the general crop con
ditions of the country are promising.
With these favorable crop prospects, upon which the prosperity
of the nation is largely based, the general sentiment of the country
continues one of confidence, and, as money continues plentiful and
cheap, trade activity is still the rule. The N close of * the .Chicago
strike is another favorable development of the past week, for nor
mal trade conditions in this great grain, provision and distributive
center will now be restored.
Manufacturing is reported more active than usual at this time
of the year, and summer shutdowns are less frequent than usual.
Labor, too, continues fully employed and is reported scarce in the
South. Manufacturers of clothing and footwear report liberal or
ders from drummers. The textile mills are running on full time,
barring the usual summer suspensions, and the raw materials, such
as cotton, wool, hides and leather, are bringing very good returns
to the producer. The farmers of the whole country have enjoyed so
many consecutive years of prosperity that they are not as a class
obliged to press their products on the market for sale.
. Lbnditions on this coast continue bright. The crops, while not
as large as expected several months ago, are still sufficient for our
own use, with more or less of a balance for export, and the loss in
quantity is more than counterbalanced by the increase in prices.-
The markets for fresh and dried fruits have thus far been exception
ally good, the 1905 pack of canned fruit has already been largely
sold, the wool clip is- meeting with an urgent demand which has
kept the market bare for months, and hops, while lately suffering a
steady decline, are still almost 100 -per cent over the cost of pro
duction. The farmer, whether a grain or fruit raiser, is thus doing
unusually well, and as long as he continues to reap fine returns from
his land prosperity will abide with the coast.. The dairymen, too,
have been making money beyond their most sanguine expectation^
of a few years ago. \
These bright rural conditions are being reflected in pronounced
trade activity in the different cities and towns. Wholesale and re
tail business are both lively, building operations are remarkably ac
tive, real estate is being sold and resold at advanced prices, and the^
colonist rates offered by the railroads are rapidly increasing the
population. This State is full of strangers from the West looking
for homes, for most of the newcomers come to stay. If the present
rate of increase from this source be kept up the census of 1910 will
contain some surprises. All of these newcomers add something to
the money and trade activity of the State, and their importance as a
factor in the prevailing prosperity can hardly be overestimated.
California and San Francisco have no cause to complain of the
year 1905 thus far. It will probably prove a record-breaker as far
as trade is concerned.
GUARDING CROP REPORTS.
INVESTIGATION into the dishonesty in the Agricultural Djf.
partment in the matter of selling to speculators the information^
gathered by the Government as to the prospects of crop yields/
is a subject in which the farmers of the country should take a keen
interest. That the (President is determined this evil shall not escape
examination and punishment is much to the credit of his energy
and sense of justice. His direction that the charges made by Mr.
Cheatham of the Southern Cotton Growers' Association, be given
to the Department of Justice, and that criminal action be taken if
warranted by the evidence, was a wise move.
It Is of vital importance to the welfare of the farmers that the
speculating gamblers be prevented from ascertaining the summing
up of the crop reports in advance of the public. It is by knowing
the truth about the amount of agricultural products that the pro
ducers are able to get all they are entitled to for their harvests, and
it is mainly out of the farmers' ignorance that speculators are able
to manipulate the markets so as to leave to the agriculturists but I
the bare cost of production. To guard against that is 011 c of the
most valuable functions of the Agricultural Department. That it is
fully equipped to do the work and is very capable at performing it
is evidenced by, the remarkably close prediction of the cotton. crop
of 1963. The department estimated there would be 9.962,000 bales,
and it was fully ascertained ten months later that the crop was 10,
002J000 bales. For the practical purpose of enabling the farmers to
decide upon their price as based upon the supply, the information
thujs given them may be considered as/exact. It would take ? almost
'supernatural prescience to get closer 'to the mark than that. For^
speculators to know in advance of the public v as large a /fact as
that gives them opportunity to so operate that their profits are cer
tain.
The dismissal of Mr. Holmes, the assistant statistician, for his
disclosure and sale of this kind of information to speculators is not
enough to satisfy the country. It is at least likely that an investiga
tion will implicate others, and the condition shown up proves that
the department, needs, a, hous,e-cleaning. The assertion' by Field
Agent White that, his returns had been tampered with in" former
years shows that the investigation should extend into some back
history- He made figures for the South western cotton States, and
they were lowered after he sent them in 1903 -' and 1904. * Such. a
statement indicates that* there may have been a systematic standing
in with the speculators, and that the frauds are not altogether new

THE SAN FRANCISCO; -GALL. MONDAY./ JTJuY-24; 1005:
FRANCE IS HAVING LOVE TROUBLE
Dorothy Fenimore
PARIS, July 5.
The very fact that France. has been
so much amused ; by M. Paul-Her
vieu's suggestion made a short time
ago that "In the revision of the civil
code "love" .be inserted among; the
other"*obligatloris of "matrimony there
in defined, is enough to show what
will be the outcome of the discussion
which resulted. and which still engages
the popular mind.
The French sense of humor is too
keen for It to permit-in the marriage
laws of , the land a clause which would
make them a target for ridicule at
home " and abroad. ;...''
When the -three, dramatic 1 - authors,
MM. Paul Hervleu, Brieiix and "Marcel
Prevost. were, appointed to make /to
the Parliamentary Commission charged
with reforming Ihe Napoleonic code a
report on the clauses' in the code re
ferring to marriage t their statement
was, awaited with general interest be
cause of the reputation whichvthey hold
as authorities on feminine psychology
and marital Infelicity.
The public 'bail,' however,- been edi
fied beyond its expectations by M. Her
vieu's stand that matrimony would: be
bettered , If love were, recognized legally
as an obligation of the marriage con
tract. ...~> 'â¢;â¢; -,: '.'\u25a0..
The matter was argued in boudoir
and cafe, and the press, not content
with editorial comment, held symposl-'
urns of lawyers and writers, in order
that the question might be debated
fairly. v " , .
Two factions arose, one contending
that love should not be materialized
by too close contact with law and , the
other insisting that the law should not
be cheapened by too close association
with I so liprlU a thing as love., i
M. Hervleu was accused oor/ r trying
to poetize the code.' His suggestion
was treated by manyâ among other 3
by the celebrated \voman lawyer, Mlle^
Chauvln â as a sentimental Idea. be
longing to the realm of literature, a
mere idealistic creation of jx romantic
brain.
There were nevertheless a few who
took it serlously^nd saw fit to discuss

HUSBANDS ARE PUT UP AS PRIZES
Lotteries and Contests Between Women Who Wanted

Kansas City, U. S. A., was lately the
scene of a' lottery whereof the first prize
was an eligible young ".Vlrtrnlan," named
Arnett, who stood on the platform/ durâ

stepped forward amid the plaudits of
the crowd. "Do you; want to be mar

on September 2$ last at a ' vllkage . near

j*6ung farmer named Coslhe, for whom
several local beauties had- long sighed in
vain, determined to sacrifice his freedom
by offering himself. 'as a prize to her who
should be successful in a bullock race. /-.:
Seven handsome peasant girls appeared
at the starting post, riding barebacked on ;
bullocks with decorated horns and tails. |
A capital start was effected, but ere half
the distance had been traversed .the
favortte was thrown,- and ; displayed her â¢
chagrin by t slezing the tail of- the second
bullock in'an endeavor to impede a rival's
progress. This resulted in an unpopular
competitor coming in first, whereat the ;
onlookers were so disgusted that they
ducked the judge In anend.
New Brunswick .was the- scene, four
years since, of a bicycle race, over a

that he did not wish for a divorce,

A CHIC LITTLE BOLERO.
The all-over embroideries lend themselves delightfully to the ex
tremely cbbrevlated garments that do dutyâ or the semblance of Itâ for
the summer wrap. A. very simple but chic little bolero Is illustrated,
the back hanging loose and free, the side seams fpllowlnÃ the curve of
-the figure, and the fronts rolling: back In reveres that reverse the usual
order7>f things and are.narrow at the top. to widen out gracefully
; toward the bottom. The sleeve, too, is short and loose, slit ~p the cen
ter, so that the full puff of the blouse sleeve is not crushed or mussed.
A border of the same embroidery Is used to edge, the little garment all
around, the new plcot edge being observed on this, making a very dainty
finish.
LAND DIVIDED INTO COLOR ZONES
foor Chance for Blondes in the Domain of Uncle
Sam, Says Scientist.
Dr. Charles E. Woodruff, surgeon in
the United States army, in a scientific
study of the color of the hair, divides
the United States in color zones, corre
sponding to those in which the races
became accustomed in the old world. In
their proper zones immigrants to this
country receive just the amount of short
light rays that their pigment allows
them to withstand. If any race over
steps Its zone,' degeneration must result,
as It Is already resulting.
" Between" JS and 30 degrees, from the
equator is the lowest color zone, includ
ing the peninsula of Florida and a bit
of Southern Texas. Tills is the same zone
as Nubia, and is suitable to the black
man. only. The negro, he says. Is tend-,
lngtoward his proper belt. The center or
population ha* moved 478 miles, from
Virginia to Northeastern Alabama, since
1790. * i'\- ->>\u25a0\u25a0
The color zone, where, only brown, red
and yellow men . can thrive, lies between
the thirtieth and fortieth^ parallels. It in
cludes the southern tierof States, and is
about the same as Lower Egypt, where
negroes must eventually die out. This
belt las wholly, unfit for whites of any
complexion. " Southern white families
who do no? leave it and 'go North every
summer become enfeebled. Indeed, de
generation and extinction is the rule
among them there, he -finds. ,-
The zone for only dark, brunettes and
people -arlth olive skins lies between ithe
thirty-fifth and fortieth parallels.? This
embraces the States where the negro dot; 3
not flourish and was : not- profitable in
slavery days.- He is. the zone of Southern
Spain. Southern Italy and Greece.- *.
North of the fortieth parallel is the re
maining northern half, of the United
States, whose, boundaries reach only to 43
degrees. In this. zone. only the brunette
immigrant from Central Europe can
flourish. ' â¢/
Outside of the forest-clad mountains,
with their misty, air and '. foliage. " which
combine to filter -out the short rays bom
bardingall men in sunny climes, there is
but one' possible xefuge for the golden
haired, blue-eyed people within the United
States. This; is the northwest corner, of \
the Pacific Coast, including Seattle, Ta
cbma and ". Portland. The region ;' offers i
almost the /same dark, cold conditions
as the cradle of the blonde " race" Itself."
The, winters are cooj to cold, and there
Is an average of only one sunshiny "day
a/week.' The white peopleXthere are
"absurdly healthy!, and - the children al
most burst with -rugged health." "They
should 1 thank '1 God } that they are pro
tected from hts sunshine," says the sur
geon. -"Seattle. Tacoma and Portland are
fairly -bristling * with brilliant blondes,
with complexions which the Eastern^ peo
ple/envy." "Blondes will thrive - also In
Southwestern /Alaska, and even In the
Adirondack and Green Mountains/but In

have a, quieting effect on the neurotic
peoplyof Denver, who"* should have the
complexions of Tibetans to withstand
their bombardment of short rays.
The Armenians, Slavs, 'Greeks, Huns.
Servians. and Bulgarians now Socking: to
this country are the people who will
flourish here, because not deserting their
zones, yhereas the blonde immigrants are
too far south even in Boston. New York
is perfectly suited for the Jews of Po
land and Central Europe.
The blonde will, however, continue to
steam over here from Europe, and may
learn to avoid the dangers of light. But
to reduce his mortality so that his disap
pearance will be only gradual he must de
vise some artificial protection from light.
To accomplish this his outer clothing for
a summer day should be white, or at least
gray or yellow, to- reflect heat rays. His
underclothing should be black or yellow,
preferably the former, which will shut
out the short violet or ultraviolet rays
not reflected with those carrying heat.
The hat should be broad-brimmed and
might well be lined with tin foil, opaqw
to all solar rays. The hair should be
long during the summer, when the short
rays are brighter.â Chicago Chronicle, "fi

MENTAL ACCURACY
Greatlr Improved hy Leaving Off Con>Â«\.
The manager of an extensive cream-
ery In Wisconsin states that while a
regular coffee drinker, he found It Inju-
rious to his health and a hindrance to
the performance of his business duties:.
'"I cannot say," he continues, "that I
*-\-<rr used coffee to excess, but I know
that it did me harm, especialy during
the past few years. -
"It impaired my digestion, grave me a
distressing sense of fullness lv the re-
don of*>Â«he stomach, causing: - a most
painful and disquieting palpitation of;
the heart, and what is worse, it mud-
dled my mental faculties bo as to seri-
ously is4-r-~. my business efficiency. ,
"I concluded, about S months 350,
that something would have to be done. ;
I <iuit the u^e of the old kind of coffee,
f.hort off. and began to drink Postum
Food Coffee. The cook didn't make ii
right at first â ehe didn't boil it long
enough, and I di^ not find it palatable
and fluit using it and went back to the
old kind of roltÂ»B and to the stomach,
trouble again. Then my wife took the
matter It) hand, and by following th<Â« dl- i
rectiocs on the box., faithfully, she had
me drinking Postum for several days!
before I knew it. W-hen I happened to
remark thnt I was feeling much better 1
than I had for a longtime, she told me j
that 1 had bÂ«en drinkhig Postum, and \
th;it accounted for it. /Vov.vwe have no ';
other kind of coffee on our \ab!e.
"My digestion has been*' perfectly ce-
stored. :ind with this improvement has
come relief from the oppressive sense
of fullness and palpitation of the heart!
that used to bother me no. and I note
such a gain in mental strength and
ar.utenesiS that I e?n attend to niv office

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, JULY. 24, 1905;
ADVANCES VIEWS
ON AFTER LIFE
Key. Ford Siiys Not Space but
Exact Line Divides Tem
poral From Immortal Body
i; DISCIPLESHIP" SERMON
Congregation Gathers for
the First Time in Newly
Fitted House of Worship
A congregation that filled It to the doors
gazed last night for the first time; since
its rehabilitation on the interior /of the
First Christian Church on Twelfth street,
near Mission. The pretty church has
been "done over" from ceiling to base
ment, and the members were proud of it
New furniture and new . carpets have
been placed In the auditorium and the
ladies' parlor and lecture hall have been
made attractive with new fittings and
decorations.
Rev. Frank S. Ford, the pastor, who is
one of the most forceful young men of
thÂ« cloth in San Francisco, delivered the
concluding one of a series of sermons on
"Desdipleship." The church has been
filled each time one of the series has
been delivered, and interest has been es
pecially lively eversincethe delivery of
the fifth one on the subject "The Disciple
at .Play," in which the Rev. Mr. \u25a0 Ford
spoke directly to the .old folks of. his
congregation on, the subject of recreation.
He told them that it did not do to be
too. puritanical In the matter of amuse
ments and that it. was all right to attend
theaters and-enjoy kindred diversions as
long as the moral fiber was not allowed
to degenerate. The pastor said, the _ the
ater had endured ever since the time of
Shakespeare and that it could not have
done so haC it been wholly bad. He even
fixed the percentage of plays in. San Fran
cisco that a good Christian could attend.
His estimate was 30 per cent. He said
there was no harm in dancing so long
as the moral fiber was not attacked. All
the Christian needed to look out for was
that his recreation did not master himâ
that it did not fill instead of merely re
lieve his thoughts.- . . :
The speaker said there were three con
ditions--to discipleship: One must re
nounce all he possesses, must renounce all
that possesses him, and must take up a
life of devotion, â¢ with the cross as a
symbol, for the Savior had said, "Who
soever does not bear his own* cross and
come after me, .cannot be my disciple."
It was necessary to give up every ma
terial end social tie that acted" as a
hindrance, he said, and continued:'^
Why are such conditions made? Of the flrtt
it Is the condition of learning. If you are to
learn any lesson you have to give up.every
thing that Is a hindrance to it. Ortho second,
all that possesses you, thourh alluring, is
Eiven up in this life to bo returned to you
as blessedness, also In this life. Whatever ot
material .wealth or social ties Is given up,
or whatever of self sacrificing service is taken
on, tends to make all relatfonshlps In this life,
as an individual or in church or state, blessed.
As to the third, dlsclplesnip presupposes an
afterward. It Is, a process of preparation of
one whose citizenship is m heaven. We are
called upon to give up all thlnga that per
tain to tho material â the body and that which
is possessed by the body, which In reality aro
not ours, that they may be ; returned to us
for our very own. The boay which we receive
for our own possession *ill be perfectly fitted
to the life and position we receive after
death. There is no Interval between these
bodies. It is not a space that divides this
temporal from the immortal body, but a mathe
matical line. Death anrl resurrection are bl
raultaneous.' When I ,dle I shall find, that I
am still alive and not in a disembodied con
dition, but embodied. Death Ehall be Swal
lowed up In life. .- _. â¢ â¢ .
\u25a0 I, am called In becoming a disciple to give
up all social ties, that they may l>e returned
lorn; sanctified, perfected and made my own.
Too church is tho type of ldÂ«al society here.
It is tli9 only society with a principle of life.
The reason of the downfall of merely ' human
societies Is' that their bond of union is one of
Felflsliness. â¢ The new testament Ideal of. n
perfectly- organized .society is represented In
Revelations by a city, the New Jerusalem,
perfectly organized, coming down from God
out of heaven, so that when to become a disci
ple I am asked to srlve up all social ties and
obligations, it is that I may b<J made "a fit
ting member of perfect social conditions.

cisco--and a -warmer welcome was never

â¢On their arrivl t the ferry they, were
met by Mrs. E. L. Sargent, long a lov
ing friend and an advocate of The Cause,
and were driven to her home at 1630 Fol
som street. Here they were greeted by
many personal friends, who had borne
thither a prodigal lot of flowersâ the glad
dest \u25a0 greetings a Calif ornlan knows. And
these have been daily replaced with fresh
flowers, the privilege of placing them fall
ing tot fond friends ' among the members
of the Susan B.; Anthony Club.
- The reception on Friday afternoon at
the Sequoia Hotel was a triumphâ an
honor to the \u25a0well-beloved leaders, and a
tribute to the cause fot equal rights.
As to the personnel of that . reception,
It was in Itself a revelation to the Un
believerâtp him who. still .clings to an
cient belief that suffragists are a short
haired, pantalooned, swaggering set,
making up the oft-discussed the third
sex.
At that affair at the Sequoia Hotel
there wasn't one mannish womanâ which
is. woman caricaturedâ among the 1500
guest* at the reception. - ,
And as for pretty gowning, a desire for
which is essentially feminine, there were
hundreds of women. , in .-me., smartest
frocks, and with soft voices, and pretty
personalities :to matchâ none of â¢ which
seemed to interfere with their being true
blue suffragists, working: to win; though
not by nagging and preaching, but by
educating, and by making friends among
men who can be Induced to think with
out prejudice. When; a man of. ordinary
intelligence can be Interested to the de
gree of talking of suffrage without preju
dice, there you have- a convert to .- equal
lights, for the justice of the thing appeals
to himâ although he sometimes hates to
admit it. â¢ .
This is the plan, however, upon which
the suffragists to-day are working, and
the strength they are gaining with each
year is evidence of the wisdom of the
policy. - "
at , the last I Legislature ; the suf
frage bill was beaten, but only by a: small
majority, and by the . smallest men, too,
by the way. All the really big men-the
acknowledged men of brain and ability
voted for the submission of the : amend
ment to the people. '.
And it might not be amiss to state
right here, that of the 6000 suffragists in
San Frnaclsco every one has her eye
upon the men who talked so stupidly
against the bill at Sacramento, and "has
him on her list"â the women standing
pat against Senator Eddie Wolfe, whom
they claim to have been the spokesman
for the opposition. Poor little Senator
Wolfe!â l am so sorry, for him, if he
really cherishes .a. desire to sit .In the
Mayor's chair, with. those 6000 women af
ter him. He'll have a swell chance to be
happy, won't he? "Â«"'â¢ > - '

SMELTER TRUST AGENTS
STILL LOOKING FOR SITE
Make Anothe* Trip Around ttie Bay ai
Guests of yEdvrnrd Chambers of
â¢ the Santa Fe.
E. L. Newhouse of New. .York and
other representatives of the smelter
trust, who are at present in this city.
were the guests of Edward Chambers
of the Santa ;Fe , road yesterday aboard
a tug on a trlpup the east side of the
bay, made. for thejpurpose of . viewing
prospective sites for the new smelter
plant,- "which the" Guggen helms pro
pose . building near San Francis
co. | .As was announced last week
in The Call the smelter people
are desirous of selecting a site
that will be convenient to the rails of
the; Southern Pacific and the Santa Fe
companies,; and they are still clinging
to the hope that a suitable site will be
found somewhere below Port Costa. â¢
It was learned yesterday that the
sriielter. people have under considera
tion the abandonment of the Selby
Works in the event of a new plant
being erected on the bay shore. Agents
of the trust have been engaged for sev
eral months, according to the latest re
port, endeavoring to get options, on
farming land adjacent to the low land
along the bay shore, with the evident
purpose of providing against possible
litigation nhould the company carry
but its plans for a new s -elter and the
smoke from its refiner proceed to de
vastate,the, surrounding country.

NEW LIGHT UPON
EQUITABLE LOAN
Mjsterioiis Slim Is Said to
Have Been for Use Among
tlie New York Politicians
SUDDENLY DISAPPEAES
Galled Dog Pund"
\)f Those on Inside in So
ciety and Mercantile Trust
Special Dispatch to The Call.
' ALBANY, X. V., July 33.âSuperinten
dent of Banks , Kllbiirn will return- to Al
bany to-morrow and will.be asked to do
a lot', of explaining about that mysteri
ous loan ; of Jtfts.Coo to the Equitable So
ciety by} the \u25a0\u25a0 Mercantile"; Trust Company.
The , loan, 'which was of long . and i gradu
ally 'increasing " proportions, was known
inside the; trust company; and the Equit
able . ring as the - "yellow, dog ; fund."
/What ' It \u25a0 was : used - for; ' wby it should
growjfrom ?;JlOO,OOO, to $685,000* In seven
years; why no attempt was everjnade to
take it i up: why the . State ' Insurance De
partment/did not know 'â¢ of -its existence
until less^than two weeks ago; why the
superintendent of banks did not show It
up :in the ; books of the trust company
when he ' made the \u25a0 examination of the
books as : required by law; who first ne
gotiated the original - amount and in
creased^ it; and who ; finally . paid it re
mains to be seen by direct evidence that
should not be difficult : to ' secure.
\u25a0 '\u0084 From a reliable source have been ob
tained answers to some of these ' ques
tions.The first and most Important is
that the "yellow dog f und\' . was intended
tOy'-take" care- of"-* matters that could not
legitimately show in the books of the
Equitable. Some politicians, both in New
York and Washington, are said to be in
a position; to throw light. upon this point.
The legislative investigation committee
will probably have no trouble In clearing
up the mystery and smoking out the men
who shared In the "yellow dogr- fund." if
they probe deep enough. -
Another Question that can be answered
authoritatively is that Superintendent of
Insurance Hendricks did not discover the
existence of the loan during his investi
gation, nor until' long afterward. â¢ As a
matter of fact, the superintendent did not
know anything about It- until his attention

it accidentally.:
-Another }_ one " of .the multifarious ques

is that "the ' yellow ' dog fund" was not

MORTON VISITS PRESIDENT.
Spends the Night as Guest at the Roose-
velt Home.
OYSTER BAY, July 23.â Chairman
Paul Morton of the Equitable Assurance
Society was a guest to-day of President
and Mrs. Roosevelt at Sagamore Hill.
Mr. Morton arrived at the President's
home from New York last evening:. He
returned': to -New York this afternoon.
As a former Cabinet officer and a close
personal friend of the President, he vis
ited him to obtain a brief rest from his
labors in connection I with . the . readjust
ment of Equitable affairs. Assurance is
given that his visit was not of serious
public significance. ':
While he excused himself from a gen
eral discussion of Equitable affairs. Mr.
Morton admitted, in response to a direct
inquiry by a representative of the press,
that a proposition to discontinue the
pension of ' $2 5,000 , a â¢ year, now paid to
Mrs. Henry B.- Hyde," .widow of -the
founder of the Equitable Society, was
under consideration. The pension; how
ever, has not been discontinued yet.
.It was.made clear by Chairman Mor
ton tfcat Mrs. Hyde's pension is to be
considered^.with~ other, pensions now
paid by the society, that is, her pension
will not be discontinued, if at all, as an
exception.': The whole . matter " of i pen
sions by the .Equitable! will be consid
ered ' purely as a : business proposition.
Chairman Morton will present the sub
ject to, the directors of the' society at a
meeting to be held next Wednesday, but
there Is no â¢ assurance that the matter
will \u25a0be definitely settled at that time.
The \u25a0\u25a0 payment of \u25a0 the ' current .; vouchers
for Mrs. . Hyde's pension,: as well as for
the: pensions of others, - will remain in
abeyance 'until a final decision, of the
general '< question of pensions shall have
been' made. 1 ","\u25a0\u25a0 --

lir. Hitfs southern wing was the
Bideshow as well as the main event at
the Eighth-street lot yesterday after
noon. He had everything in it that a
pitcher ever dreamed of possessing, and
the Commuters kept swinging away alj
the '.time and hitting nothing but
bunches of atmosphere. Joe Nealon
ranked next to Hitt as hero by cutting
loose a double cushion wallop In the
fourth when the Seals had a full house,
scoring every man on the sacks. In the
morning game at Oakland, Jimmy
Byrnes took all the .fight out of th*
Seals in the ninth with a triple.
Hitt never slowed up from the mo
ment the umpire told the kids to wade
In and play balL Kruger managed to
bite off a scratchy hit in the second
spasm, and that one wallop held the
Oaks for the* rest of the day. Besides,
the young busher winged nine of 'em
out on strikes and passed but two to
first. ââ-
Neither team could cut in with a run
till the fourth, when Dunleavy booted
Waldron's drive and Mohler pushed one
out to the 6core board for two stations.
Hildebrand bit at a floater and p/oduced
only a pop fly to Devereaux, but Charley
Irwin made it a full house when he
waited for a pas 6. and they all came
home as Joe Nealon tapped the leather
for a two-cushion drive to the flagpole.
Shea beat one to short and he and
.Nealon worked a double steal while
Jimmy Byrnes was lost in thought.
Things were also breaking right for
the Seals in the next period. With two
down, Mohler soused one through sec
ond, and ran all the way to the plate on
Hildebrand's - two-base shot along the
Irft field foul line. Irwin produced a
simple fly to Dunleavy. but Dun had no
glue on his mitts, and. as the ball rolled
away from him. Hildebrand tore right
through to the pan.
One of Bill Devereaux's Lodi admirers
presented the red one with a big fat
watermelon when he approached the
plate in the first spasm. It was deco
rated with a bunch of red ribbon and
made Bill blush and feel .hungry. But
the rest of the bunch beat him to it,
for while lie was being retired Dun
leavy. . Byrne*, and othÂ«rs grabbed the
delicacy and put it away in Jig time.
The score:

TRIES TO BURN
HIMSELF ALIVE
Demented Chinese Eesorts
to Fire Route and Life Is
Saved by Parting of Queue
Wong Lung, a Chinaman living at 903
Dupont street, last evening attempted to
burn himself alive by placing his head
over a lighted gas jet and kindling a
lire of shavings under his -feet. Lung is
undoubtedly crazy and this is the second
time he lias attempted self-destruction
by the fire route. He was discovered by
his uncle, Fook You, .who had a desperate
fight to prevent the destruction of life
planned by the incapacitated Celestial
brain.
It is but three weeks since Wong Lung
vras sent to the Detention Hospital for
insanity after having attempted death
by the same manner he sought last night.
All of the unfortunate heathen's hair is
bunted off the top of his head and the
once cherished queue is but a burned
and charred relic. But Lung- wots not.
His one desire since his gray matter
ceased working is to join his fellows in
the happy land where life is one long
fcmoke of the poppy extract.
As Lung twisted his queue arouqd the
gas pipe he tied a sailor's knot about the
Iron tube, struck a match and awaited
developments. When the hot flames be
gan to scar his face and head he uttered
an uncouth yell that reverberated
throughout the narrow alleys of the yel
lcw quarter and spent its force on the
car drums of a thousand terrified Chinese.
Lung's 4-year-old boy ran into the room
and clapped its little long nailed fingers
in- baby glee at the sight of papa Lung's
pyrotechnic queue.
Swarms of chattering Chinamen gath
ered about the hou?e. while others sought
cover in rat holes arid on roofs to escape
the stray .bulJrts cf what they divined
was the outoreak of another bloody tong
\u25a0war. Special Policeman William King
tore into the house with drawn revolver.
As he crossed the threshold Lung's queue
parted with a rasping sound and "the in
fane Chinaman fell groaning to the floor.
Dr. Kur Him was summoned and when
he finished swathing Lung with walrus
tooth oil and other peculiar dark-looking
infusions, the injured man was taken to
the Central Emergency Hospital, where
the white doctors took a hand in the
treatment, soothed the burns and lodged
Lung in a padded cell. His uncle. Fook
You. cays that he will swear to a com
pjaisit of insanity and hopes to have his
fire-loving relative transferred to a place
where people do not play with matches
or secure -means' for self-destruction.
Keeping' boarders is often the begin
ning of successful hotel management.
The man who has made money with
boarders, who has learned how to keep
the tables filled with guests â how to
advertise â has, learned more than half
of the art of hotel-keeping.

MAGNIN'S JULY SALE

STEPHEN WOULD
BOYCOTT PRESS
Chief Surgeon of Emergency
Service Consults With
Dr. Ward and Physicians
Chief Surgeon J. I. Stephen, of the
Emergency service, is still 'seeking to
compass his desire to eject the news
paper men permanently from the city hos
pitals. Using the words of the chief, the
newspaper men "see too much and know
too much for the good of the service."
During the last week Dr. Stephen, who
has been the prolific subject for many
newspaper stories, has been conducting a
general consultation bee. Each surgeon in
the service hag been asked to offer, his
opinion as to the restriction of the re
porters.
Dr. Ward, president of the Health
Board, is said by Stephen to stand "heart
and hand" with the elusive doctor's pro
position of excluslveness. If Stephen, wno
Hays he already has the backing of the
Board of Health, can get the co-operation
of Mayor Schmitz and Abe Ruef. the day
will soon come when he can run the
Emergency Service in his peculiar man
ner without fear of exposure 'in the
press.
. Mayor Schmitz has already said that
he does not coincide with Stephen's views,
and under no circumstances will he allow
the taking of any such action as is con
templated by Stephen ar.d his "support"
in the Health Board. Although Stephen's
"support" in the Health Board is be
lieved to consist only of Dr. Jules Simon,
proprietor of the Maudsley Sanitarium,
Stephen says he has the co-operation of
the entire, board, with the Mayor and
Ruef included.
Not one of the surgeons who do the
work in the Emergency Service listened
favorably to the chiefs proposed plan
of secrecy, and none would commit him
self in the -slightest degree In favor of
such a move. One of the physicians in
the service said that Dr. Stephen had
instructed two nurses at the Central
Emergency Hospital, and one of the stu
dent nurses to "look after his interests"
and learn, if possible, just where the
newspaper men got their information re
garding him. The chiefs action in employ
ing spyfhg nurses is disliked and severely
censured by the rest of the attaches
about the hospitals. The nurses' who are
assisting In the drawing up of the chief's
code of. procedure to exclude the press,
are shunned as vipers by the doctors and
other attaches.
Ever since the night when two people
died, probably because the chief eurgeon
could not be /ound In the city. Stephen
has spent little time at the hospitals. His
orders are given in whispers to the head
nurse, Mrs. Cannon, who diffuses them
throughout the service. >.
Drs. Ward and Stephen, according to
the chief, held a long consultation on the
restriction bill Friday night, which Dr.
Stephen reports as having been very fav
orable to the ridding of the service of
the presence of newspaper men.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, JUL^i 24; 19O!5;
VICTIM OF HOLD-UP MEM
AT POINT OF DEATH.
SHERIFF mRNETT MAXES ARREST
Assault on Grocer
, Gook Garef ully
' .Planned.
Pieces of Lead Pipe
Used in Crime
Found.
OAKLAND. July 23.â Further investiga
tion of the assault on and, robbery of
Thomas \V. Cook of 1805 Fruitvale avenue
last night shows that it was one of the
most diabolical attempts at murder ever
perpetrated in Alameda County. The vic
tim, a portion of whose skull was
crushed. in by blows rained upon him by
the thugs, is lying unconscious at a sani
tarium in' Alameda, and death may. oc
j^ur at any moment.
w Sheriff JJarnett to-day took into cus
tody James Crowhurst, a clerk at 1192
East Twenty-first.. street, -and- is holding
him in the County Jail under suspicion
pf knowing- the perpetrators of the as
sault and robbery.. The Sheriff then went
to. San Francisco, where he had reason
to believe that the murderous ruffians
had fled. . Crowhurst protests that he
knows nothing of the affair. < .
Only for a brief moment since, he was
struck down by the men who beat him
into insensibility and robbed him has Cook
recovered sufficiently to say a few" words.
The robbers did their worklwith pieces of
lead pipe wrapped in clot:i, tied on with
stout cord. Last night one piece of pipe,
Si inches long, was found near the scene
of. the robbery. To^iay men employed by
Sheriff Frank Barnett found a similar
lilece of lead pipe, evidently a section- of
the other, and wrapped up precisely as
the first piece was, in a vacant lot within
Two hundred feet of the Cook home on
Fruitvale avenue.
STAINED WITH BLOOD"."
Both pieces of pipe were covered with
blood stains, , the cloth otherwise being
white and clean, showing that they were
prepared specially for the dastardly deed
which was carried intu execution. It
is evident that the robbers had planned
exactly when and where to attack their
victim.
The victim â¢of the cruel crime is 20
years old. In the absence of Fred. B.
Cook, his brother, who is visiting in Can
ada, he has been In. charge of their'gro
cery at - 12S8 Twenty-third a.venue.
It has- been, his custom on Saturday
Rights'- to take all the week's receipts of
cash home in his pockets rather than
risk leaving it over Sunday in the store
safe. Evidently the robbers knew of this
practice. Young Cook has been im
mensely popular among his acquaint
ances, and he. became imbued with the
idea that nobody in the world would
do him any harm.
Last night he closed the store about 9
o'clock, placed $200 in gold and $50 in sil :
ver coin in his pockets, and started to
ro to his home on Fruitvale avenue, half
a niilG froni the store.
ATTACKED IN DARK PLACE.
Along the highway known as the old
Redwood road the sidewalks are uneven,
trees at intervals cast shadows, lights are
few and it is altogether an ideal place,for
holdup men. ' But the thugs who beat
down young . Cook took no . chances of
detection. 'Jnjey attacked h:m from both
In front and behind. With pieces of
lead pipe as bludgeons they smashed in
his skull, struck him down within a
block of his home, robbed him and left
him, as they thought, deaa.
Dr. J. H. Callen, who has had charge
of young Cook's case, said to-night:
"Cook began to so into convulsions this
morning, and I had him taken to the Ala
meda ' Sanitarium, where an operation
v-as performed this afternoon by Dra.
Lum. Crosby and myself. We re
moved the clot that was upon the brain,
but the fracture of the skull is very bad,

Sunk to the lowest depths of degrada

of promise, was arrested vy Policeman
Cornelius yesterday morning just as the
starving man was about to steal a can
of milk f/om a doorway. An inordinate
passion for gambling and drink lowered
him to the gutter.? . \u0084 ; , "
Like the Prodigal Son,". McHugh lived
on refuse for weeks while, slinking about,

McHugh Is 0n1y .^22 .years old. ; Before
drink and the gambling , fever ..'turned
his brain he was a surveyor. He. earned
marked praise for t work !he did ; In : gov
ernment service^ in 'Alaska./ Everything
promised him a brilliant career.
\u25a0 He came tb: thls ; city x several months
ago and the false glamour'of>the tender
loin stirred his blood;?: He found :plenty of
friends while his money lasted and his
course on the downward path was rapid.

McHugh wakened one morning to find
himself penniless- and friendless. He felt
that ho could win back all that'hehad
lest. The luck' had to turn, he .thought.
Ho pawned what few. trinkets hehad, but
the pitiful sum with which' he. was to re :
coup his fortune at cards was- lost. ' ;
For days jhe i walked about jthe streets
too proud to beg and^ he : muttered to
himself firmly, too honest -to steal.-
Hunger / \u25a0 tortii'red him". /With slinking
gait and hanging head he wipuld - hurry,
past the restaurants; where the ;'sinell of
cooking food tantalized him. ,Qne night
he passed v a row of 'garbage 'cans over
which ; a pack â¢\u25a0 of hungry .; mongrel .'dogs
were .quarreling.' Famished, â¢ McHugh
strode over, and .fighting: off the dogs
seized some of the scraps over which they
were snarling. On j another^ night ho re
turned to the same place and the?outcast
man ate ravenously like the outcast

Nominations of delegates to the Re

of the league tickets will be ready to

keen interest in the work of preparing

It is understood that the Ruef forces
will put; up .-"strong, fights against the or

that Ruef will; detach forces from the La

purpose of ' electfhg independent delega

graft programme in the Republican nom
inating convention. ' The boss has no

OLD MAN IS FOUND
STARVING ON STREET
Policeman . Takes Harry
LloycUto Hospital. Prob-~
; ably Tod Late.
Harry Lloyd, an aged man, was found
in a condition of acute starvation by
Policeman Bruce atthe corner of Tenth
and Mission r streets last night and
taken to the Central Emergency Hos
pital. At the hospital Dr. Herzog
found that Lloyd was suffering from a
general emaciation, induced by starva
tion. Lloyds chances for; recovery are
considered slim.. - .
At the hospital, the old man told a
pitiful tale of. sickness and starvation.
He said that 'for days he had wandered
the streets of the city-sick, unable to
procure work. All that he had to fill
his stomach was a few bits of bread
that he -begged at the kitchens of
restaurants. He slept in the gutters,
and sometimes .when passing pedes
trians were goodrhearted he managed
to get 5 or 10 cents, with which he
bought a. bed for the. night in one of
the cheap* lodging-: houses -that" abound
down by th<T Barbary Coast. Lloyd is
afflicted with heart trouble and his long
stage of starvation has , so , run him
down that he has reached the critical
period where life is but a question of
hours. V \u25a0'-* A -
Every care was extended tne suffer
ing man and under the motherly hand
of Mrs. Swett. the matron.' he was made
more comfortable than he had been
perhaps since he left his mother's care.
Tears came to tho unfortunate mans
eyes when the nurse .with soothing
hands smoothed out his pillow and gave
him food and drink. -. If Lloyd recovers
he will-be scnt^ to the' Almsnouse. .
