MILLIONS IN SECURITIES ARE SAFE
DESPITE FURY OF BALTIMORE FLAMES
Financiers of the Stricken Monumental City Are
Relieved by the Discovery That All Was Not Lost
and Are Busy Preparing for Work of Reconstruction
BALTIMORE, Feb. 9. â The Gover
nor, the Mayor and various municipal
officials had a conference to-day, at
which it was decided that Baltimore
for" the present needs no outside help.
At this conference also was developed
the machinery for an advisory legis
lative committee to act in conjunction
with the Legislature.
The Stock Exchange chambers met
and decided to rebuild as soon as pos
sible. The same story can- be told of
practically every commercial house,
while on every hand is, evidence of
private effort toward rehabitation. Old
buildings, long used; private residence
near the business section, in fact every
available structure, bears the an
nouncement that within is the tempo
rary office of a firm. Â» Labor is in de
mand and the newspapers already
contain display advertisements for
men to begin the work of plearing the
ruins.
A great cloud was lifted this after
noon when it was discovered that
practically all of the vaults and strong
rooms and safes of the financial con
cerns, whose buildings were destroyed^
were unhurt. A tremendous loss in
securities had been anticipated, but
vault after vault yielded up its treasr
ures unharmed. From one trust com
pany's safe alone papers to the
amount of more than $200,000,005
were recovered.
SMALL BUILDINGS ESCAPE.
Another surprise was the discovery
that two financial concerns whose
homes were directly in the path of
the flames were practically unharmed.
These were the Mercantile Trust Com
pany and Brown Bros.' Bank. The
escape of these buildings is their lack
of height. They do not exceed four
stories and as they were surrounded
by lofty structures the flames swept
over them.
As yet no figures oh loss and Insur
ance that can be regarded as official
are obtainable. A careful report of
expert builders and business men
places the loss at $125,000,000 and the
insurance from $80,000,000 t/> $90,000,000.
It 'is probable these estrmates will
stand with slight changes when the
final figures are written.
To-day gave opportunity for a care

WASHINGTON.' Feb. 9.âThÂ£*Wash

with applications for appointment to
the office of Assistant United States
Attorney" made vacant by the death of
E. J. Banning. The Senators have de
cided to allow United States Attorney
Woodworth to name his own assistant
and 'have given notice to him and all
applicants to that effect.
Senator Perkins to-day visited Sec
retary Wilson in response to a tele
gram from Governor Pardee asking the
influence of the California delegation
for intervention in behalf of the owners
of cattle in Southern California, now
quarantined because of prevalence of
Texas fever. The cattle referred to are
upon the ranges of the forest reserves,
and it is found necessary to remove
them to new grazing grounds. The
message of Governor Pardee states that
the Federal authorities refused to per
mit the starving cattle of Southern
California to be moved out of the State
unless dipped in Beaumont oil. It de
clares that there is no Beaumont oil in
the State and further that dipping
would doubtless kill a large percentage
of the animals. Much of the stock, it
says, is free from Texas fever, and. the
belief Is expressed that removal should
be allowed after inspection.
In response to the expressed wish of
the Governor, Senator Perkins called
the delegation together and himself
went to Secretary Wilson. The Secre
tary went into the wh61e matter fully
and pointed out the great danger that
lay in moving the cattle. He finally de
clined to change his prohibition order.
Senator Perkins and Representative
Gillett called .upon the President to
day in company with Senator Voorheis
of California.
Senator Ankeny of Washington led
a party of Yakima Indian chiefs upon
a visit to the White House, the Sena
tor acting as Interpreter for the red
men in a sharp and cordial talk with
the President. The Indians are here
to take up the disputed boundary ques
tion with the Interior Department". .One
of the party is Chief Eneas, the, head
of the Yakimas, who was in the Indian
war of 1856-57 in Washington, and who
signed the treaty made between his
people and Governor Isaac Stevens.
â  United States District Attorney Mar
shall B. Woodworth was interviewed
at his residence Jast night. He refused
to make the statement as to whom he
would appoint to fill the vacancy left
by the death of E. J. Banning, his
late assistant.
Mr. Woodworth said that he would
consider the candidates, of which there
were many, and make the appointment
in about ten days. The most promin
ent candidates in his mind, he said,
were: S. Duryea of Placerville, Lug
ger Brown of Los -Angeles, T. Hutch
inson of Napa, and John McKenna.of
San Francisco. The appointment will
in all probability be made from one of
these four candidates.

of the firm says there was no gasoline

electric lights were turned off by a

originated in the Hurst building, but
how it started is yet to be learned.
Outside the flre, area this afternoon

with tramping thousands. Multitudes
of people, residents as well as the out

wrecked buildings. Solid lines of spec

blocks all along the line surged, such
crowds as Baltimore has seldom seen.
Along Charles street, back from the

dle the travel that ordinarily Is-dis
tributed among half adozen streets, now

Broadway, in New York, at the height

it was an orderly crowd and gave no
trouble to police or soldiers.

One of the most . remarkable freaks
of the. flre was the escape of the big

wrought destruction on all sides of this

ONE DROWNED;
OTHER IN CELL
Dramatic Escape From Military
Prison on Alcatraz Island Re
sults Fatally for John Cole
A dramatic escape from the confines
of the United SattesTnilltary prison on
Alcatraz Island occurred last evening
and as a result Andrew J. Allen occu
pies a cell in the City Prison and John
C. Cole is beneath the waters of the
bay. The story of the desperate chances
taken to gain freedom is unequaled in
the history of escapes from the island.
Allen was turned over to the_ police
of this city by the captain of the ferry
boat Encina!, who picked him up off
Lombard street wharf in a state of ex
haustion. His narrative of the escape
from Alcatraz on a raft, the subsequent
death of his companion and his own
sufferings is replete with sensational
features. r ',\tl '
â¢When seen after being transferred to
the City Prison Allen was still shiver-
Ing from his battle with the waves and
was averse. to discussing the case. He
finally consented to make a statement.
His story is to â  the effect that about
6:30 o'clock, after the first, verification
of the prisoners had been made by the
guards. In company with Cole and a
convict named Pratt, he made a break
for liberty. Owing to the fact that he
was employed in a clerical position it
was not necessary for him to answer
to his name. His two companions. like
wise were so situated that their ab
sence would not be noticed for some
RAFT IS LAUNCHED.
They cautiously made their way to
the water on the westerly side of .the
island. Four planks were secured and
firmly lashed together and the impro
vised raft was successfully launched.
The three then climbed aboard and
shoved off from the island, j Pratt, who
was serving a sentence for a slight In
fraction of military rules, at the last
moment decided to return, and accord
ingly jumped into the water and swam
back. -
The tide soon had the raft in its
clutches and carried it towai'd this city
and freedom. Cole and Allen lay pros
trate on the lumber, desperately clutch-
Ing the sides. Several ferryboats passed
them "and the swell caused washed
them off the raft, repeatedly. Miracu
lously they managed to regain the ratt
each time. They were rapidly becoming
benumbed by the cold and death stared
them in the face.
At this juncture the ferry-boat Encl
nal hove in sight and then was enacted
the tragic feature of the escape. The
swell caused by the approaching
steamer Ditched the raft hither and
thither and the lashings'-which held it
together finally broke under the strain.
Both of the men were cast Into the wa
ter, but Allen managed to grasp a
pUink, with which he buoyed himsitZf
up until ; rescued. Cole sank beneath
the waves. â¢ 5,
ALLEN IS RESCUED.
Allen, realizing that all hope of es
cape was gone; shouted lustily and the
captain of the Encinal heard his cries.
A boat was lowered and the exhausted
man- taken on board. When questioned
he revealed his identity, and upon the
arrival of the steamer at her slip in
this city Allen was turned over to Pa
trolman F. F. Bean, who took him to
the Harbor station.
Allen was not at all exercised over
the death of his companion and spoke
lightly of the matter. He was some
what depressed by his lengthy .emer
sion in the water, but after being sup
plied with. dry garments recovered his
spirits. While in the Philippines he
was sentenced to two years' imprison
ment for -drunkenness and indecent
conducj. , , . / . . .
On April 15,' 1901, while confined In a
guardhouse in Manila, aided by several;
other desperate characters, he tied up
the sentry and escaped. He was cap
tured three days later and sentenced to
three years at Alcatraz, fifteen months
of which he has served. Cole, who was
undoubtedly drowned, was . serving ' a
sentence of twelve years. Allen will be
taken back to Alcatraz by the Govern
meftt authorities tc^-day.

threatened the postofflce every package
was removed from the building and put
in the vaults. Postmaster Warfleld di
rected the efforts of Federal employes
in saving the building. Every window
was kept wet inside, and while a num
ber were cracked by the heat, none
was broken sufficiently to cause a
draft.
For a time It was feared that a food
scarcity with an acompanying advance
in prices would occur, but It is felt this
apprehension has no grounds. Supplies
are short, but railroad facilities have
been unobstructed, and merchants be
lieve they will be able to meet
demand.
"REMOVAL OF DEBRIS.
The ruins of the fire have been cooled
sufficiently to permit the handling of
debris. Work of clearing some por
tions of the ")urned district began to
day. Hundreds of laborers engaged by
the Department of Street Cleaning
were put to work at the eastern end of
the ruins. The task is a hard one and
the work will necessarily be slow.
Many weeks will elapse before all the
streets within the fire territory will be
open to traffic. Bricks to the depth of
four feet, large marble and granite
blocks, great girders, bent or broken,
and networks of telegraph, telephone
and electric light wires cover the
streets. On both sides of the thorough
fares in many places are towering walls
that will have to come down before any
attempt can be made to clear the
streets at those points.
There are still scores of small fires
burning and many great heaps of
smouldering ruins that are sending up
clouds of smoke. No effort has been
made to extinguish these after they can
do further damage. The only places
where the fire departments are at
work are at the boundary lines of the
ruins where they are drenching with
water every pile of debris which emits
flames. Out of town fire companies,
which rendered such valuable service
in stopping the progress" of the fire,
have returned to their homes.
Mllltary^regulatlons to-night were of
the strictest sort.
CZAR COMMANDS WAR

MANIFEST TO PEOPLE
ST. PETERSBURG. Feb. 10â The
Official Messenger this morning con
tains the following "supreme mani
fest:"
"By the grace of God we, Nicholas
II, Emperor -and autocrat. of all the
Russian, etc., make known to all our
loyal subjects:
"In our solicitude for the mainte- I
nance of peace, which is dear, to our i

solidate tranquillity in ..the Far East
In these peaceful .alms we signified
assent to the proposals. of the Japa
nese Government to revise agree
ments regarding Korean affairs exist
ing between the two Governments. !
However, the negotiations begun upon
this subject were not brought to u
conclusion and Japan, without await- '
ing the receipt of the last responsive
proposals of our Government, de- â 
clared the negotiations broken off and
diplomatic relations with Russia dis
solved.
"Without advising us of the fact that !
the breach of such relations wtiuld in it- ;
self mean an opening of warlike opera- .
tions, the Japanese Government gave
orders to its torpedo-- boats to suddenly
attack our squadron standing in the
outer harbor of the fortress of Port
Arthur.. Upon receiving reports from
the Viceroy In the Far East about this, ;
we immediately commanded him to an- j
swer the Japanese challenge with

WHAT TEA DOES TO
RHEUMATICS.
â 
"When you next take tea, think of this.
Tea contains 175 grains of Uric Acid
in every pound.
Meat contains only five to seven
grains.
Rheumatism is Uric Acid in the blood.
Uric Acid accumulates from food when
th* digestive apparatus cannot create
enough Alkaline elements (like soda) to
neutralize it.
This Acid collects urea, or worn-out
waste matter, from the system.
That Urea enters the blood when Alka-
line action has not previously dis-
solved It.
By* and by the waste matter reaches
the joints and muscles, through circula-
tion of the blood.
There it gradually deposits in solid
particles, like granulated sugar.
These solid particles grind between
the Joints and muscles at every move-
ment.
This grinding causes irritation and
pain.
These in turn may develop inflamma-
tion and swelling. That inflammation
bestirs Nature to help herself.
She proceeds to coat the hard Uric par-
ticles over with cushions of pulpy mu-
cous, like the first healing strata of an
outer sore.
This pulpy covering grows to the
bones. ajÂ» well as to the particles deposit-
ed. There it hardens like plaster or
sealing wax. Then we have "bony
Joints."' almost inflexible, and usually
fixed In a bended position, from the pain
and inflammation.
That is Rheumatism at its worst.
It is bad enough before it gets that
far.
There in but -one sure way of curing
Rheumatism. The first step is to neutral-
ize the Uric Acid already in the system.
Next, to dissolve, and carry away, the
hard deposits that grind between th*Â»
joints. Then get the digestive apparatus
Into such healthy condition that it will,
unaided, produce less Uric Acid, and
more Alkalines.
This is what Doctors generally have
failed to do.
It is what I studied a lifetime to ac-
complish, and achieved only after many
failures and thousands of experiments.
At last I found, in Germany, a Solvent
which was not only effective, but abso-
lutely safe to use.
Few agents powerful enough to be ef-
fective in Rheumatism are safe.
My discovery, now called "Dr. Shoop s
Rheumatic Cure." acts directly, but in-
ternally, upon* Uric Acid in the joints
and muscles.
U dissolves, and carries off. the pain-
ful deposits, producing an immediate Al-
kaline condition of the blood, and neu-
tralizing the Acid In it which would
have fed the Rheumatism and extended
the disease.
It won't restore bony joints to flexibil-
ity, and It can't undo. In a week, the
damage caused by years of rheumatic
condition.
But it will benefit e%-ery case, and It
will entirely cure most cases of Rheuma-
tism.
So sure am I of this, that I will supply
Dr. Snoop's Rheumatic Cure, to any siclc
one who writes me for it, on a month's
trial, at my risk. . . .
If it succeeds, the cost to him Is only
$5.50 for the six bottle treatment.
If It fails. I bear the whole cost my-
self.
And â he alone shall he the Judge â
shall decide who shall pay.
Surely you will not continue to suffer
! when you can thus get well, at my risk.
I have written an important Treatise
on Rheumatism, telling of Its relief and
cure.
It is free to Rheumatic people.
Write me a post card for it to-day.

A PLEASANT SURPRISE
la Store for Those Who Doubt.
When you read that a sufferer of
many years' standing has been com-
pletely restored to health by using
Smith's Cure-all, you are inclined to
doubt the statement and, in fact, have
r.o belief in It whatever. The reason
for this is that so much is claimed for
the Cure-all it is Impossible for any
one to believe it; if the advertiser con-
fined his claims to the curing of one
aisease. as do th* proprietors of Pyra-
mid Pile Cure, readers would' have
much more faith in published testi-
monials. Those familiar with this
great .remedy know that testimonials
as-to its merit may be relied upon im-
plicitly, also that the cures brought
about by its use are little short of
marvelous. The genuineness of the tes-
timonial here {riven is vouched for and
Is but one of thousands received:

and Arm in a Hay 3Iow
VICTDI OF THE ATTACK
TELLS STRANGE STORY
Officers Believe Woman Is
Withholding Facts and Young
Man Who Made Threats a
Short Time Ago Is Suspected
CHICO. Feb. 9. â Miss Eva Moak.
a young woman 22 years of age, a grad
uate of the Chico Normal School, was
seriously wounded to-day by being
twice shot by an unknown person at
hÂ«*r home about five miles southeast of
Chico. One of the bullets grazed the
top of her head and another passed
through her left shoulder blade and the
upper part of the left arm. According
to Miss Moak, she had gone into a hay
mow of the barn to feed a horse and
while standing on the top of. a bale
of hay a gun seemed to go off at her
feet. A moment later another shot was
fired, the bullet wounding her in the
shoulder. 'She then Jumped from the
hay into a shed part of the barn, and
while running toward the door another
f-hot was firad. While trying to open
the door a fourth shot grazed the top
of her head. She ran into the housa
and fainted immediately upon entering
the room.
Officers from Chico spent all the aft
ernoon in investigation, with the re
sult that they feel that the injured
young woman has not told all she
knows of the affair. It is a fact that
about a year ago a young man, who
had become infatuated with her. made
threats of sufficient gravity <o warrant
the officers in suspecting him of doing
the shooting.
Miss Moak will probably recover,
though the wound in the shoulder may
be more serious than a hasty examina
tion would indicate.

The New York, being in danger, there

hour.- after which the gunboat sailed
for Puerto Plata. She was hit twice by
rounds and apparently by hundreds of
bullets, for she stopped and lowered
boats, evidently to plug up the holes
made in her hull. The failure to land
thr ammunition is a serious blow to
General Jiminez, for whom it was in

pride and weakened the authority of
the Ottoman empire In Europe and are
looking for a chance to retrieve their
position and incidentally to chastise
Bulgaria.
SOFIA, Feb. 9.â In high official quar
ters it is believed. that. Turkey is has
tening preparations to attack Bulgaria
the moment the international situation
seems favorable. No doubt is enter
tained that the TurksKuill strike when
Russia is well involved in the Far East
war.
The opinion is known to prevail in
Constantinople that the Russo-Japan
ese conflict would so preoccupy Eu
rope that no considerable opposition
would arise to a reassertion of Turk
ish power in Macedonia- and even be
yond its borders in the direction of
Sofia and Belgrade. Meanwhile.insur
gents are resuming hostilities in Mace
donia and planning a general campaign
when the weather moderates. Their
leaders declare . that the Macedonian
misery already is indescribable and
they conceive no developments they
need fear.
HOTEL PORTER MAULS
BELLIGERENT COLLECTOR
Fighting Results From Attempt to
Force Occidental Guest to Pay a
Night's Bar Bill.
C. G. Spencer^ a young Hawaiian,
who recntly registered at the Occi
dental Hotel and has since been cut
ting a wide swath along the line, was
the cause of a Jjvely scene in the lobby
of the above mentioned hostelry yes
terday afternoon. During the night
previous, so the story goes, he visited
a saloon on Grant avenue and when
he was prepared to leave after several
hours of drinking the* proprietor re
minded him that he owed $86 50 for
liquor.
Being without the necessary cash
and having enjoyed credit in the place
before. Spencer was permitted to de
part without making a settlement.
Yesterday afternoon, however, the
saloon proprietor sent a tough looking
fellow, apparently a prizefighter, to
the Occidental Hotel to interview the
young Hawaiian regarding his bar bill.
The collector persisted in annoying
Spencer, who complained to the man
agement of the hotel and a porter was
delegated to subdue the belligerent
saloon representative.
The latter was ejected from the hotel
and when he reached the sidewalk he
challenged the porter to combat,
which immediately ensued, resulting,
however, in a quick victory for the
porter, who rapped his antagonist
several times on the head and face
and finally, put him hors de combat
just as a policeman arrived on the
scene and placed the collector under
arrest for disturbing the peace of
Spencer and the rest of the guests of
the Occidental.
While the row was in progress Spen
cer, who had concluded that it was
getting to warm for him around the
hotel, hurried up to his room, and,
gathering together his belongings,
moved to more secluded quarters in
another portion of the city.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
FIFrY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT
â OF THE-r â
Connecticut Mutual Life
Insurance Company.
To th* Members: m ,
From the point of view of life insur-
ance companies as investors the most
striking incidents of the year 1903 were
the great shrinkages In the nominal val-
ues or prices of the stocks of the railway
systems, with a corresponding though
much slighter shrinkage in the prices of
their mortgage securities.
In only one point was the Connecticut
Mutual affected by these events in com-
mon with all investors in securities of
the highest class. The present market
value of its corporate and municipal se-
curities shrank during the year about
$770,000 on a par of $25,586,570. costing
$25,906,461. with a present market value
of $26,339,694. Of this $99,460.25 is In
bank stocks: $729,616 in railroad stocks
($250,000 of which is held as collateral),
which have changed little: the $25,077.-
384 of bonds are of the best class for se-
curity, and having as a rule many years
to run. more favorable market conditions
are likely to restore more or less of for-
mer higher prices: bttf meantime the ap-
parent gross assets afid surplus are just
so much less than if prices had been
maintained throughout the year.
GENERAL RESULTS.
' The Company's experience â¢ for the
vear 1903 in the several other features
incident to its business may be briefly
stated as follows: An Increase in its
premium income; an increase in Interest
Income: an Increase In net assets; the
usual persistence in its policies: an in-
crease in the business in forcei'the same
low rate of expense as in 1902; a mor-
tality loss very considerably -less than
that expected, with a saving thereby of
$482,510;. a decrease in the holding of
foreclosed real estate of $773,920.9.1. The
details of the year's operations will be
found in our financial statement.
That we have beon able to maintain
our traditional low rate of expense and
yet keep good the amount of business In
force is due to the faithful zeal of our
agents for the true ideal of a mutual life
insurance company; the best service for
their clients at least expense to them;
and this in face of the high commissions
and bonuses paid to agents aritl rebates
given to insurers by other' companies,
very difficult to withstand by the one or
to overcome in the other.
The death rate Inevitably varies some-
what from year to year, and that for
1903. while very favorable. w#s some-
what less so than in 1902. The care with
which our risks are selected and the
healthful character of the limited terri-
tory, in which we operate have given us
a very favorable experience throughout
our history and are the reasonable assur-
ance of Jts continuance.
INVESTMENTS.
The additions and improvements upon
thÂ«Â» Home Office properties have been
substantially completed. We have a
building which for durability, conven-
ience* and attractiveness as a business
structure is nowhere surpassed and Is
proving a good investment at its cost.
Ever since the panic of 1893, and due
in some part also to the flood of stocks
and bonds of corporate enterprises of all
sorts of quality since offered to the pub-
lic on more or less attractive represen-
tations, the market for real estate has
remained in the quiet state into which it
then' fell. During the last year. how-,
ever, we sold properties that cost us
$8S8.339; 54 of these Sold at some profit;
15 sold at a loss: the net loss on these
sales was $186,039.49. due principally to
that incurred on three pieces which came
to us from some loans made many years
ago. upon properties the conditions of
which changed unfavorably afterward.
In this connection it will be of Interest
to state that during the year the Insur-
ance Commissioner .of Connecticut has
made the examination of this company
required of him by law every four years.
In the course of which he valued the
foreclosed real estate remaining after
deducting the sales of that on which the
loss was made as above noted at $349.-
742.39 less than its cost. As his valua-
tion is but an estimate and we have
sold several pieces since at considerably
more than his estimate, and as our
whole experjence in these matters has
shown that such valuations have been no
guide to the outcome, we have made no
change on our books further than to take
up as a possible future loss the item of
$349,742.39 as a liability under the head
of "Contingent real estate depreciation
account." thus giving practical present
effect to a loss which may or may not be
incurred.
We shall pursue the same course with
our present real estate which has given
us good results in the past; hold until
local conditions favor pales at fair
prices. â¢
The only bonds on which interest Is In
default are those of the City of Galves-
ton. payment having been suspended in
consequence of the flood of 1900. The
city's liability Is unquestioned.
REDUCTION OF DIVIDENDS.
One of the principal events for us Jn
the past year lias been the decision of
your Directors that in consequence o?
the conditions wuich have been progres-
sively developing for tlie past ten years
and more it was no longer expedient to
draw so heavily on past accumulations
of surplus In order to maintain the high
scal*Â»- of dividends which has obtained
since 1881. and that It was expedient to
reduce dividends to conform more nearly
at least to the present ability to earn
surplus. Since 189S we have used current
accumulations and have also drawn upon
the then surplus to a very large amount
in order to postpone as long as might be
any reduction in dividends. The princi-
pal cause of our inability to earn as
much surplus as during the years from
18S1 to 1S98 has been the slow but
steady decrease in the rate of interest
realized on Investments, which would
have caused a much earlier reduction of
dividends, as was the case with other
companies, but for the economies prac-
ticed in the management.
The circumstances of this reduction,
which has been foreshadowed in our re-
ports for several years, are set forth in
full detail in a communication addressed
to our policy-holders which is being
placed in their hands for their full Infor-
mation. It is. therefore, not repeated here
except to say:
"While we have always striven, and
always shall 3trive, by every legitimate
means, to make the current cost as small
as possible, wÂ« must never lose sight of
the fact that insurance which is not se-
cure is r.ot worth payinp for: .and that,
while wj? strive to make It cost as little
as may b?. we must be certain to make it
chst- enough to keep It indubitably se-
cure against all foreseen contingencies
incident to a business and to the invest-
ment of funds during Ions periods of
time."
. * ; *-f; â¢â â¢''.-â  â¢ â â¢ ;â â '.* i â¢
"It is proper, under the circumstances,
to repeat: the Company's business con-
tinues to be conducted upon the same le-
gitimate lines and by the same stand-
ards which have made its long history
as a mutual- life insurance company a
record unequaled in beneficial results to
its memhors and beneficiaries. The same *
conservatism, prudence and unequaled
economy are maintained: and Jts condi-
tion warrants the assertion that It will
be able to iftilize to the full all future
conditions favorable to the earning of
surplus: while In the "distribution of it
your Directors will have always In view
the two-fold purpose: to make the an-
nual payments of policy-holders as small
as possible, and. in any event, to care-
fully and certainly maintain that
strength which has always been one of
Its distinctive features."* .
EFFECT OF INTEREST. /
Tn this connection it may bÂ» well to
call attention to the fact that any
change in the average rate of interest
takes effect much more slowly In a life
insurance company than in a bank. Tbe
latter, having to be prepared for the
contlns*ncy of sudden and -great .de-
mands from Its depositors, keeps its as-
sets in short-time paper, which being
frequantly changed at current rates
speedily reflects their changes. The life
insurance company^If managed on
sound lines â is subject to no such con-
tingency, and Is able to secure the best
results by long-time Investments;, so
that its assets as a body change but
slowly and can reflect only the general
tendency of rates over long periods. The
effect of the downward tendency, which
we foresaw In 1SS2. has corns but slowly
to its present development; and it flnd-i
us prepared with a reserve some $3,000.-
000 greater than it would have been had
we continued to take new business on the
old basis, as others did.
The present surplus by our own high-
er standard of solvency is $1,629,312.55.
after allowlnp the contingent deprecia-
tion Item of $349,742 already mentioned.
By the usual 4 per cent standard of
solvenev It Is about $3,000,000 greater, or
say $7,500,000.

NATURE OF PRESENT COMPETI-
TION.
The competition for public favor in
life insurance continues to travel largely
on three distinct abnormal lines: First,
a postponement of ail dividends for ten
to twenty years, whereby the effect of
extravagant expense in concealed till the
end of the period, and whereby the sav-
ings on thÂ«Â» premiums and reserves of
those who drop out in the meantime (ex-
pected to be about two-thirds of the
whole in twenty years) are to be di-
vided among thos^ only 1. ho remain
through; a speculatwi for the few lucky
at the expense of the many unlucky
"mutual" policy-holders:
Second, by the so-called incontestable
policy, which puts upon the honest pol-
icy-holder the payment of the loss on
the dishonest one. to whom alone such
a feature would presumably be at-
tractive:
Third, by giving every policy-holder
by way of an "annual cash value" tho
right .to withdraw his contribution t>Â»
the reserves in any year, which thus
gives all the policy-holders the right ta
demand all the reserves in any year to
the complete destruction of the Com-
pany: and this demand is a first Hen on
all the assets and a first obligation 011
the part of the Company, to which thÂ«s
insurance feature is a mere temporary
and easily defeasible incident. The pre-
miums paid in ostensibly for life insur-
ance 'nave a "string" to them, to be used
at will, which converts the Company in-
to an actual Savings Bank, without the>
interest on deposits which makes it to
the personal advantage of the depositor
not to withdraw his deposits under ordi-
nary circumstances: and with the fur-
ther and great difference, that whatever
one deposits in the bank suffers no sub-
traction from its facÂ«?. and receives in
addition all the interest earned less a
relatively slight expense account. whil>-
the premiums paid to the life Insurance
company must annually contribute t->
losses and to relatively heavy expenses;
so that the reserve which can he with-
drawn is as a rule much smaller than
the sum of the premiums he has paid In.
and his privilege costs him out of all
decent proportion.
And r.ot the least mtschlef of this
practice is the fact that in reality anil
in the resulting attitude of mind of the
insured it subordinates the duty of pro-
tection tpr . which alone life insurance
exists ana without which It would never
be used and could never have b#en con-
ceived to the changing personal Inter-
ests of him on whom that duty con-
stantly rests. Under a multitude of con-
ditions, he is frequently- tempted to usb
for himself the fund which alone se-
cures that protection to others which is
still his duty, and his most serious duty,
because of their necessity and their con-
stant danger. He no longer repards his
payments as a fund permanently with-
drawn from the exigencies of his busi-
ness and sacredly devoted to the per-
formance of his unse:fish office toward
his own. Ills contract at once and al-
ways prefers his claim to theirs.
And it will not be many years before
the great mass of the life insurance
business of the country will stand on
this basis, its continuance and not only
the welfare but the existence of the
companies contingent on the non-exer-
cise of the right of withdrawal of any
and all funds at will.
In the midst of this sort of competi-
tion, which brings an enormous business,
but with enormous waste, at an ex-
pense which is as reckless as It is un-
necessary, and which contradicts every
principle and method by which proper
and adequate results as to the security
of contracts, the cost of Insurance,
equity between members, and the In-
tegrity of the Company Itself can be as-
sured, the Connecticut Mutual holds
steadfast to the truth which, be it never
so widely or lightly disregarded, can
never be denied, that the paramount pur-
pose of life Insurance, the one and only
peculiar service It Is contructed and
fitted to render, which it alone can ren-
der, and tlife only one worth its neces-
sary cost even at a minimum, and the
one spring of Its high motive. Is "to d<Â»-
fÂ«nd and provide. for" fnose whose wel-
fare depends on the continuance of one's
life and who must suffer in all their fu-
ture by its loss; that Mutual Life Insur-
ance Is the equal co-operation In good
faith of those on whom rests the sacred
privilege and duty to protect, to the enrl.
that the needed protection may be most
certainly and effectively given, and that
by such equal co-operation the cost to
each may be made as small as possible:
that the Company which undertakes to
become the instrument of such co-opera-
tion 13 therefore bound to shape its
every plan and practice to conform teÂ»
those conditions which enable It to ful-
fill those ends In the highest degree and
with the greatest certainty in that far
future to which Its contracts extend.
That beneficent function of Mutual
Life Insurance. In that view of its in-
trinsic morality, the ConnÂ«cticut Mutual
has fulfilled with an unequaled success
for fifty-eight years; and it moves to-
ward its future of beneficent uses ade-
quately prepared. .

Points for Which St.

Charges Japan With Re
sponsibility for the
War Outbreak.
ST. PETKRSBURGH. Feb. 9. â A
lengthy official" communication Issued
to-day gives the Russian account of
i he negotiations which Jed to the rup
ture.
"Last year." says this Foreign Office
note, "the Tokio Cabinet, under the
pretext of establishing the balance of
power and a more settled order of
things on the shores of the Pacific,
Mibmitted to the imperial Government
;i proposal for a revision of the exist
ing treaties with Korea. Russia con-
Bented and Viceroy Alexieff was
charged *o draw up a project for a
new understanding with Japan, in co
operation with the Russian Minister in
Tokio, who was entrusted with the
negotiations with the Japanese Gov
ernment. Although the exchange of
views with the Tokio Cabinet on this
subject were of a friendly character
Japanese social circles and the local
and foreign press attempted In every
way to produce a w;irh'ke ferment
.-tmong the Japanese and to drive the
<jo\vnunent into an armed conflict
with Russia. Under , the influence
thereof the Tokio Cabinet began to
formulate greater and greater de
mands in the negotiations, at the same
lime taking most extensive measures
to make the country ready for war.
All of these circumstances of course
disturbed Russia's equanimity, but
they induced her to also take military
:;tjd naval measures.
JAPAN'S RIGHTS IX KOREA.
"â >>"<?verllie!fcss, to preserve peace in
the Far East. Russia, so far as her in
lontestable rights and interests per
mitted, gave the necessary attention
to the demands of the Tokio Cabinet
and declared herself ready to recog
nize Japan's privileged commercial
and economic preponderance In the
Korean peninsula, with Xhe concession
of the right to protect it by military
force in the event of disturbance in
that country. At the same time, while
rigorously observing the fundamental
principle of her policy regarding Ko
rea, whose independence and integ
rity were guaranteed by previous un
derstandings with Japan and by trea
ties with other powers, Russia in
sisted on three points:
"1. On a mutual and conditional
guarantee of this principle.
"2. On an understanding to use no
part of Korea for strategic purposes,
as the authorization of such action on
the part of any foreign power was di
rectly opposed to the principle of the
independence of Korea.
"2. On preservation of the full
freedom of navigation of the Straits
of Korea.
'The project elaborated in this sense
did not satisfy the Japanese Govern
ment, 'vhkh. in its last proposals, not
only declined to accept the conditions
vhkh 3nj,eared as the guarantee of
'.he independence of Korea, but began
m the same time to insist on pro
\ ihior.s to be incorporated in a project
r*-ssrdiTÂ»s the question of Manchuria.
TREATY RIGHTS RECOGNIZED.
"Such demands on the part of Japan
naturally m*r* inadmissible, the ques
tion of Russia's position 5n Manchuria
<oncerr:inc, in the rtrst place. China,
but also all the powers having com'mer
ciil interests in China. The Imperial
Government, therefore, saw no reason
tc include in a special treaty with
Japan regarding Korean affairs any
provision concerning territory occu
pier! by Russian Troops. The Imperial
Government, however, did not refuse,
so long as the occupation of Manchuria,
lasted, to recognize both the sovereign
ty of the Emperor of China in Man
churia and also the rights acquired
th'rrc by other powers through treaties
with <"Mna. A declaration to this ef
fect had already been made to the for
eign Cabinr-ts.
"In view of this the Imperial Govern
ment, after charging its representative
at Tokio to present its reply to the
Ifist proposal of Japan, was Justified in
c\pecting the Tokio Cabinet lo take
into account the considerations set
forth above, and that it would appre
ciate the wish manifested by Russia
lÂ«- Â«:omo to a r**aceful understanding
mth Japan. Instead of this, the Japan
ese Government, not even awaiting
this r^ply. decided to break off negotia
tions and to suspend diplomatic rc!a
tior.f.
"The Imperial Government, while
laying upon Japan the full responsibil
ity for any consequences of such a
course of action, will await the de
velopment of events, and the moment
it becomes n?cessary will take the
most decisive measures for the pro
lection of its rights and interests in
the Far East."

Italian Oflieer Comments on the At
tack Made by Japanese.
ROME, Feb. 10.â The Patria to-day
publishes comments on the ' first en
gagement in the Far East, supposedly
from tho pen of Admiral Bettolo. who
has twice filled the post of Minister of
Marine. The writer says:
"The result of this first attack is ex
ceptionally grave and shows that the
Russian commander was not prepared.
It points also to a possibility of future
catastrophes. The Japanese showed
notable perspicacity and foresight, and
the fact that the Russians were sur
prised at night proves that thev were
not vigilant. If the Russian ships had
been surrounded by metallic nets, as is
prescribed in warfare, if they had em
ployed searchlights, and, especially, if
their torpedo-boat destroyers had been
active, this 'surprise could not have
brought such disastrous consequences.
The Japanese have proved their water
scout service to be excellent, as, in the
darkness of night, they knew exactly
where to strike. As the. Russians have
no dockyard facilities In the Far East
to repair the damages inflicted on tr.eir
shipe. it follows that the three vessels
struck by torpedoes are useless for ser
vice in the present war."

MUSCOVITE RAGE AROUSED.
Sullen Populace Stirred to Patriotism
by Japan's Coup.
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 9.â The
news that Japan had duplicated her ac
tion at the opening of the Chinese war
by a torpedo attack on the Russian
ships off Port Arthur created intense
excitement. Extra editions of the
morning papers printed early in the
forenoon, after the appearance of the
Official Messenger, conveyed the intel
ligence to the population of the capital
and dispelled any lingering hopes that
war could be averted. The Czar and
his Ministers, who had been informed
immediately of the receipt of Viceroy
Alexieff 's telegram, accepted the gage
and prepared to face the reality of war.
Feverish activity reigned at all the
ministries and war preparations were
pushed in all directions.
The Russian Red Cross Society al
ready has sent 2000 beds to the Far
East and Sisters of Mercy are leaving.
The temper of the people which was
indicated in the great personal demon
stration accorded to the Czar and Czar
ina In the Imperial Opera-house yester
day evening, the audience rising and
singing "God Save the Czar and Give
Him Victory," was further manifested
this morning after the arrival of the
news from Port Arthur In the crowds
of volunteers that besieged the general
staff offices.
The naval reserves have been called
out.
The action of the Japanese in attack
ing the Russian fleet without a decla
ration of war is denounced as an out
rage by the Russians generally and the
result. Instead of discouraging them,
seems to have been to supply the spark
necessary to fire Russian patriotism.
From the large centers throughout Eu
ropean Russia comes information that
the country Is already aroused by the
Japanese action in breaking off the ne
gotiations.
Commenting on the address of loyalty
ace at 4 o'clock this afternoon. At the
command of the Czar a great concourse
of Ministers, court officials, high state
functionaries, ladies of rank and mili
tary men assembled in St. George Hall,
all of the men arrayed in full uniform.
After some delay, which became almost
oppressive because of the feeling of
solemnity plainly apparent, the doors
of the Imperial apartments were opened
and the Czar entered, wearing the uni
form of the First Guard Regiment of
Russia, with the Dowager Czarina on
his arm.
The Dowager wore a costume of pearl
gray and no Jewels. The young Czar
ina, wearing her favorite white and sil
ver, followed, escorted by the Grand
Duke Michael and heir presumptive.
The entire Imperial family followed in
order of precedence.
Approaching a group of naval and
military officers his Majesty turned
gravely and greeted them with the cus
tomary Russian phrase. "I wish you
good health, gentlemen."
The officers responded with a loud ac
claim, shouting vigorous hurrah3.
The scene became one of wild en
thusiasm, amid which the Imperial pro
cession moved forward, entered the
chapel, advanced to the altar and stood
with bowed heads while the choir and
clergy intoned an impressive interces
sory service of the Greek church. An
intensely religious spirit pervaded the
entire assemblage, which crowded thtf
little palace chapel to its utmost capac
ity. During the recital of the litany
many knelt and even bowed their heads
to the chanel floor.
The court chaplain, attended by the
deacon, reverently approached the Czar
and sprinkled him with holy water
from the chalice and presented a cruci
fix, 'which the Czar kissed fervently.
At the conclusion of the service the
Imperial party slowly retiree? A.3 they
re-entered thepalaee another service
was enacted. The Czar made an ad
dress. Darkness had fallen before the
service was finished.
Serious differences have arisen in
high quarters over the command of the
Russian land forces in the Far Ea*t.
v. ne faction favors placin both land
and sea forces under Viceroy Alexieff.
while the generals and other high of
ficers of the army believe that the
prestige gf General Kuropatkin. the
War Minister, is essential to achieving
success with the land forces and they,
therefore, urge a division of authority.
In any event it is understood that
Viceroy Alexieff, as the Czar'a repre
sentative in the Far East, will have
general direction of operations.
As the passage of Lake Baikal by
train across the ice appears to be too
dangerous, the Russian reinforcements
wfll i ross the ice on foot and the war
material will be transported over a
temporary line.
A despatch to the Novoe Vremya
from Port Arthur says:
"In consequence of Korea's neutral
ity, it is assumed here that Japan will
be obliged to withdraw her infantry
arid artillery from Seoul. Much un
easiness is reported from Seoul, owins
to the arrival there of Japanese sol
diers, who Intend to build barracks.
The Korean r.oblemen who have been
residing in Japan have received per
mission to return home."
A rigid censorship is exercised on
all telegrams from Port Arthur and the
public is still completely in the dark
as to the result of the fighting there.
. The report given out by the Admiral
ty this afternoon as to the sinking of
eleven Japanese warships in the Far
East traveled over Russia and Europe,
and St. Petersburg was besieged by
telegrams asking for confirmation.
Later in the day, when doubt was cast
on the accuracy of this report, public
anxiety became more active. Inquiries
for'an official statement were met with
the response that in accord with the
circular issued last Sunday all official
reports would first appear In the Offi
cial I.Iessenger.
The statement published in London
that Kurino, the retiring Japanese
Minister, presented the note from hla
Government on February 5, is not true.
The note was received here on tha
evening of February 5, but it was not
presented until February 6.
from the provincial council of Taro
stave, the Xovoe Vremya says It indi
cates the sentiments of the whole RusÂ»
sian people, adding, "Woe betide Ja
pan."
The effect on the Bourse, where it
was rumored the full extent of the
fighting at Port Arthur had not been
made public and that the engagement
was still progressing, was that a re
sumption of the panic seemed abso
lutely inevitable. The market had no
support. Imperial 4s falling another
point. Lottery bonds were quoted at
38 roubles and bank stocks at 26.
United States Embassador McCor
mick was notified this morning that
Russia had no objection to the United
States looking after Japan's Interests
in Russia. No current business will
be left by Kurino, the retiring Japan
ese Minister. McCormick's principal
duties will be to protect the few Jap
anese who reside in European Russia,
There are only twenty of them in St.
Petersburg, and five in Moscow, but
there may be difficulties in Asiatic
Russia.
It is learned that Kurino recom
mended to his Government that, in
stead of the action taken, it suspend
negotiations with Russia and to offer
to submit the controversy to The Hague
arbitration . tribunal, but It is be
lieved here that the Japanese feared
that on account of the excited con
dition of the people they would not
support the Government in such a
course.
The Russian authorities declare that
the Russian response was Jn Baron
de Rosen's hands in Tokio and was
being translated when Japan's notifi
cation of the severance of diplomatic
relations arrived.
The latest returns of Russian, war
ships in the Far East total ninety-four,
including eight battleships, sixteen
cruisers, seven gunboats and fifty-six
torpedo boat destroyers and torpedo
boats.
Three more battleship and nine tor
pedo boats are to go to the Far. East
in the spring.
The vast square In front of the Win
ter Palace was crowded this evening
with an immense assemblage. Among
the excited, cheering crowds the wild
est repor 4 of occurrences in the Ear
East were circulating.
Those who attended the religious ser
vice in the palace to-day asserted that
the Japanese had attacked Port Arthur
and that the fight was still progress-

the sky was clear. There
was a light southerly breeze
and a hazy horizon. Deep
silence settled down.
Explosions Under Water.
1 was going to bed at
1 1 : 30 o'clock when I heard
three distinct but muffled
explosions, -one after an
Â«Â»iher. Apparently they
came from under the wa
ter, for the Columbia vi
brated violently. Instantly
firingwiththe 12-pounders
and 3-pounders began.
Searchlights were placed,
but without much method.
1 watched the operations,
thinking they were only
maneuvers, till midnight,
when the firing had almost
ceased, entirely ceasing at
* in the morning.
At about 1 o'clock two
battleships, the Retvizan
and the Cesarevitch, and
one large cruiser passed us,
coming toward the harbor
entrance. The battleships
soon lav across the nar-
rows at the entrance,
where both are now
aground and helpless.
They are very close to
gether and are not block
ing the entrance, except
for ships of heavy draught.
The Retvizan had been tor
pedoed forward, the Ce
sarevitch aft.
The cruiser listed to port
is aground outside of the
entrance of the harbor.
She also was torpedoed.
Excitement of Russians.
At 2:40 some Russian
naval officers came to the
Columbia in a state of
great excitement, saying
the Viceroy had ordered
us not to attempt to leave,
their object apparently be
ing to prevent us giving
information to the Japan
ese concerning the extent
of the damage.
Up to 4iis time we
thought the operations
were only maneuvers or a
scare, but now we began
to suspect something ser
ious, especially when at
day we saw the strange,
pathetic appearance of the
l wo torpedoed battleships.
We suspected a collision, but
soon learned that these battie

torpedoed. Jt seems strange,
for though flashlights were whirl

The sun arose very red, dis

zon of three two-funnel cruisers,
on whose masts we. afterward dis
tinguished the flag of the rising
sun of Japan. They came boldly
within long-distance range and
both remained watching for two
hours after daybreak.
A strange apathy seemed to
possess the Russians. Crews of
white-faced, gaping men crowd
ed the forward decks of the dam
aged vessels.
I saw. through a glass, the
cook of the Ratvizan calmly
throwing out slops and men in
the other vessels carefully wash

the anchor was weighed no ves

the Japanese or to fire a single

was at 8:20 o'clock. They were

which proceeded toward Dalny.
At 9:15 o'clock the Russians

red. Then again came silence,
everything having passed off with
less noise than an ordinary naval
review.
SECOND BATTLE BEGINS.
The Russians had now outside
the harbor five effective battle
ships, live effective cruisers, one
volunteer cruiser, one gun vessel,
one training ship and seventeen
torpedo-boats and destroyers.
The latter were grouped near; the
entrance of the harbor.
It was almost 11 o'clock this
morning when a section of Jap
anese ships, including five battle
ships, appeared along the hori
zon. They were in fine order.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY J.O. 19.04.
At 11:15, say, came a flash
from a' Japanese vessel. This
landed a 12-inch shell near the
torpedo-boats and disabled a bat
tleship. The aim was splendid.
Owing to the confusion of
quarantine officials or perhaps be
cause the Russians thought the
Japanese would dislike to fire
near the British flag, the Colum
bia had been lying close to the
Russian fleet and in the line of
fire, so that^the Japanese shells
aimed at the battleships fell thick
ly around her. Several, bursting
near her stern, strewed her deck
with splinters and water.
CARRIES OFF HIS GUARDS.
Captain Anderson then got un
der way, although ordered by the
Russians not to leave, and despite
the protests of the Russian
guards aboard, who were event
dally conveyed to Chefu. On
one occasion, when shells were
bursting around us, the captain
called:
"Boy, get me some cigarettes."
Officers Wright and Nicholson
and Engineer Smith were cool
ness personified. The vessel was
brought out of her excessively
dangerous position by running
near shore and then making full
speed for Chefu. The Russian
guards were praying fervently
and the Chinese crew was fright
ened, but worke<J well. We feared
the Russian batteries would sink
us for disobeying orders or send
a torpedo-boat in pursuit. The
captain had repeatedly signaled
for permission to proceed, but his
signals were not answered.
The bombardment of the fo?ts
lasted till about 12, the Japanese
shooting with good aim. Two
shells burst on the summit of one
fort and numbers on the face of
cliffs and along the beach. All
of them were heavy shells.
Owing to the length of range
VIEW OF "THE ENTRANCE TO
THE FORTIFIED HARBOR OF
PORT ARTHUR.
all shells burst on contact with
water or land. Some threw out a
yellow smoke, but generally it was
a cjense black smoke, temporarily
concealing the ships. The rate
of fire on both sides was slow and
many Russian shells fell short.
The Sevastopol jvvas hit by a
heavy shell near the base of her
forward funnel. Another three
funneled battleship was struck
amidship on her armor plating.
A third, also a battleship, was
struck abaft her armored section,
near the stern.
We could 'not ascertain the ex
act damage done. The fleets
were about three miles apart. Ap
parently no ship on either side
was disabled.
The Russian cruiser Xovik
fought pluckily, keeping by far
the closest to the Japanese. All
of the heavier fire was concen
trated on her and compelled her
to retire on the battleships. The
other Russian cruisers fought at
first outside the line of battle
ships.-
The Russians seemed to fight
with little formation, probably
owing to the cramped space, be
ing never more than a mile and
a half fronvshore. They remained
all the time under the guns of
the forts, which fired over them,
but not frequently. The heaviest
shore batteries fired over us aild
the air vibrated strong and there
was a great crackling around us.
Before the action' we saw the
Russian battleships throwing
beds' and other lumber through
the gunports, and Chinese sam
pans were busily engaged in pick
ing up these articles, including
ping pong tables, until the shells
began to fall.

BRITISH EXULT OVER JAPANESE
VICTORY AND RUSSIAN DISASTER
Believe the Mikado Has Already Obtained Com
mand of the Sea by His Bold Stroke.
LONDON, Feb. 10.â The . dispatch
from Major General Flug, Issued at St.
Petersburg, on the engagement of Port
Arthur has not yet reached the Eng
lish newspapers, and the various ac
counts of the Port Arthur fight pub
lished this morning leave much to be
desired on the point of exactitude. It
Is the general opinion of .the British
press, however, that Viceroy Alexleff's
dispatches conceal the extent of the
damage that the Japanese onslaught
inflicted upon the Russian fleet and
that when the actual facts become
known it will be seen that Japan, by
her pluck and energy, has practically
secured command of the sea.
In an editorial article the Daily Tele
graph says that, unless all signs are
astray, "the Far Eastern fleet which
Russia built up with extraordinary ex
ertions during the last five years is in
its death agony."
The Times says the moral effect of
the blow which Japan suddenly de
livered can 'hardly be exaggerated,
and that the immediate strategic con
sequences are scarcely second in im
portance to the moral effect. All of
the daily papers express the greatest
satisfaction at such a catastrophe to
Russia and unexpected initial success
on the part of the Japanese.
COMMENT ON HAY'S NOTE.
Secretary Hay's note to the powers
on the integrity of China created great
interest at the Japanese legation here,
where it was characterized as "a seri
ous blow to Russia."
Beyond this statement, however, the
ese kept a splendid formation, re
tiring:'slowlv in line to the south

The Columbia escaped with a
small hole in her deck, caused by
a splinter from a shell, and some

STOCKHOLM, Sweden, Feb. 9.â The
legation officials refused to b* quoted.
The daily papers publish the note with
great prominence, but while admitting
its extreme importance, and urging the
careful consideration of the proposal,
they comment upon it in a tone of con
siderable caution. The Times says It
hopes It will meet with general support,
as It would limit the danger of the dis
turbance of the world's peace.
The Morning Post points out that the
difficulty is to define what it meant by
"China." but says it thinks that Great
Britain would readily assent to Secre
tary Hay's proposal.
The Daily Chronicle. and the Stand
ard are equally in favor of the idea If
it can be put into execution, but these
papers think the proposal requires close
scrutiny, owing to the difficulty ofvear

German Naval Comment on the Re
' :U- ; ' [verse at Port Arthur.
BERLIN. Feb. 9.â Japan's Initial suc
cess in the first attack with torpedo
boats on the Russian fleet off Port
Arthur produced a deep impression,
both upon the people and upon miji
tary and naval critics here. Groups
gathered around the distributers of the
extras in the streets and read the news
almost with exclamations of gladness.
The comment at the Marine Depart
ment was that eveji the temporary dis
ablement of three warships placed the
Russians at a great disadvantage in
the future operations. It was added
that the torpedoing of the enemy's ves
sels lying under powerful land batter
ies must have been carried out dar
ingly and skillfully. As Viceroy Alex
leff did not mention any Japanese
lossc; in his first dispatch, the common
talk of the naval officers was that the
Japanese had shown that they could
handle their. ships better than the Rus
sians.

PARIS, Feb. 9.â As the day wore on
a great wave of pc-pular sympathy for
Russia was brought out by the news
of the engagement off Port Arthur.
The newspapers without exception se
verely arraign Japan. The Temps,
semi-official, says:
"Japan's brutality In making a night
attack before a declaration of war i3
her second offense against the rules of
international law."
The Journal Des Debats declare? Ja
pan's action was contrary to rules of
international law. giving promise th;it
Japan proposes to conduct the war
without regard to modern usages of
warfare.
The Patrie gives sensational promi
nence to its assertion that Japan com
mitted an act of International treason,
compares the attack on the Russian
Meet of Port Arthur with the blowing
up of the Maine, and asserts that Eu
rope will hold Japan responsible for
thta treason.
The authorities expressed the belief;
that Japan committed a breach of in
ternational law.
Notwithstanding this bitterness, how
ever, universal recognition was given
to Japan's audacity and it was evi
dent that Japan's naval prestige had
been materially increased.
The press was informed by a his;!*
Russian authority that, now that Ja
pan has begun war. the Russian Gov
ernment, following the manifesto to be
issued in St. Petersburg, expects that
the various states will issue proclama
tions of neutrality.
In Russian diplomatic circles the suc
cess of Japan's attack last night nat
urally aroused the greatest regret. It
was frankly- admitted that Russia ex
pected to be defeated upon the sea. but
it was added that she would certainly
conquer on land.
PARIS. Feb. 10. â The newspapers
this morning unanimously denounce
Japan's action in attacking the Rus
sian ships at Port Arthur before a for
mal declaration of war as a trait
worthy of savages and contrary to the
laws of nations. Pro-Russian sympa
thies are universally expressed, but an
equally conspicuous note is the sat
isfaction with the probability that
hostilities will be localized to the pres
ent belligerents.
ATTITUDE OF FRANCE.
Will Give Russia Xo Assistance in the
Far East. y
PARIS. Feb. 9.â The news of the first
Japanese attack with torpedo-boats on
the Russian fleet off Port Arthur cre
ated consternation here. The officials
of the Foreign Office were among the
first to receive the information and the
advices were similar to those of the St.
Petersburg Official Gazette, showing
that two Russian battleships and ona
cruiser were damaged and also Show
ing that four torpedo-boats made the
attack. An official of the Foreign Of
fice said:
"It Is profoundly to be regretted that
such a decisive step has been taken, as
it terminates the efforts the powers
might have made to avert actual war
fare."
Information has been received here
showing that the British Government
will issue a declaration of neutrality
within a few days, perhaps immediate
ly, and that France will take the same
course within a day or two.
At a conference of Ministers held at
the Elysee Palace to-day under the
presidency of M. Loubet. Foreign Min
ister Delcasse communicated the news
of the first Japanese attack w"ith tor
pedo-boats on the Russian fleet off Port
Arthur, and announced that the French
Minister in Toklo had been instructed
to assure the protection of Russian sub
jects and their interests in Japan.
The attitude of the French Govern
ment in view of the war Is now deil
nitely determined upon. France will
maintain neutrality under any and ail
circumstances, the Franco-Russian al
liance being construed as not requiring
France to intervene in behalf of Russia,
even should Great Britain or any third
power intervene in behalf of Japan.
The naval engagement off Port Ar
thur Is understood to have mainly occu
pied the attention of the Council of
Ministers. The impression prevailed
that the three Russian ships torpedoed
were so disabled as to be unserviceable
for the remainder of the war. thus
placing the Russian fleet in a state of
manifest inferiority. It is said that
members of the Council of Ministers
expressed astonishment at the alleged
negligence of the commanders of th*

UNITED STATES COMMENCES A MOVEMENT TO PRESERVE THE INTEGRITY OF CHINA
REPORT A RUSSIAN WAR VESSEL
WATCHING FOR JAPANESE LINER
Anxiety Felt as to Safety of Toyo Kisen Kaisha's
Steamship America Maru Owing to
Recent Incident on Ocean.
According to information that came
to hand in this city yesterday, a Rus
sian warship is supposed to be hover
ins somewhere between the Hawaiian
Islands and Japan in order to inter
cept the America Maru of the Toyo
Kisen Kaisha steamship line, which is
en route to Yokohama.
The information concerning a Rus
sian warship reached the " Japanese
Consulate yesterday. The information
was based on statements made by
some of the crew of the collier Hero
which is lying off Port Ix>s Angeles.
Some of the crew of the Hero are
Japanese and their statements made
yesterday were telegraphed to this
city.
The men claim that while the Hero
â¢was about nine days off Port Los An
geles, after leaving Honolulu, a
warship bore down, upon them, but
kept out of speaking distance. The crew
of the Hero assert that the stranger
was flying the Russian flag and that
ehe was heavily armed. ,
When the Hero displayed the Aus
trian flag the warship changed her
course and disappeared in the distance.
Others of the crew of tfie Hero, in ad
dition to the Japanese, corroborate the
story concerning- the Russian warship,'
but the officers have so far not made
any official statement of the incident.
In shipping circles in this city
many rumors have circulated in the
last two weeks that a Russian war
ship had been sighted in the track of
vessels plying from San Francisco to
Japan. No official report has been
made in the past month of any Rus
sian warship calling at Honolulu.
The capture of the America Maru
would be a valuable prize for Russia,
as the vessel is carrying a quantity of
war material for its home Govern
ment.
The America Maru left her on. Jan
uary 25. after being delayed for some
days by the rumor of war between
Russia and Japan. She carried twen
ty-three cabin priEsengers and a cargo
of foodstuffs, guns and ammunition
for the Japanese Government. She
railed at Honolulu six days after her
departure and is due at Yokohama at
the end of this week.
It is pcss-ible that she may have been
followed from Honolulu by the report
ed Russian warship. The America
Maru. with her sister ships, the Hong
kong Maru and the Xippon Maru, have
been acquired by the Japanese Govern
ment in order to be converted, into
cruisers, in accordance with the con
tract of the Tovo Kisen Kaisha Com
pany and the Government of Japan.
The Nippon Maru and the Hongkong
Maru are now in Japanese waters,
having arrived at Yokohama in Jan
uarv.

U. Yossioka, secretary to Uyeno,

patriotism that will send them all to

In speaking of the present situation
Yossioka said: "Up to the present

They will leave on the Gaelic, which

It is believed that there are a large

Consul Fowler Says Interests in Orient
Will Be Affected by War.
John Fowler, Consul General from
this country to Chefu, China, who has
been at the Palace for two days await
ing the departure of the steamship
Gaelic for the Orient, whither he is
bound to resume his duties, regards
with deep concern the outbreak of
war between Japan and Russia. Ow
ing to the friendly feeling existing be
tween this country and its warring
neighbors across the Pacific he de
clined to discuss the situation last
evening from a political standpoint,
explaining that a statement from him
might be regarded as indiscreet by
the Washington authorities. As to the
commercial interests involved the
Consul General said that the United
States would lose a great deal. Upon
this subject he said:
"Russia and Japan have been buy
ing largely in the American markets
and it is very likely that this trade
will now be shut off, for purchases by
(-ither of the belligerent governments
would be prohibited by the authori
ties of this country. We have been
doing a business of about $20,000,000
with Northern China through New
chwang, Chefu and other ports sit
uated on the same gulf as Port Ar
thur. Through Chefu alone there
passes annually about $4, 500.000
worth of commodities from this coun
try destined for consumption in
Northern China.. - It is natural to ex
pect that if -the -war continues there
will be considerable fighting through
out Manchuria and importers of our
â goods will not care to take chances of
shipping to various points within the
disturbed territory. Chefu is likely
to. figure as very important in the war,
for it will be through that city that
many of the dispatches will pass.- I
would not. like to discuss for publi
cation my views as to what stand Chi
na may take % in the event of being
forced to take' a hand'irt the war, but
I will state that the Chinese have been
looking forward to the present . trou
ble for many months and her. states
men have no doubt carefully consid
ered every issue and. are already pre
pared to announce what side the em
pire will take."
Consul General Fowler's leave â  of
absence does not expire until April 1,
but he decided to cut short his visit
to this country and hasten back to
Chefu, where his services as the rep
resentative of, the United States may
be needed at any moment.

Presidio Officers Make
Careful Study of.
War Ground/
The news of the commencement of
hostilities in the, Orient caused more
or less commotion and excitement, at
army headquarters yesterday and war
*was practically the entire subject of
conversation there during office hours.
General MacArthur and his staff
spent a large part of the afternoon
poring over maps of every kind, size
and description in order to become
.familiarized with the scene of the
present action and the surrounding
country and waters contingent there
to, over which the conflict will proba
bly take place. Major West, aid to
General MacArthur, and Colonel
George Andrews, adjutant general,
were much interested in the little isl
and of Tsushima lying in the -channel
midway between Japan and Korea,
as from indications this little spot may
play a most important part in the
naval portion of the war- This island
is so located as to practically com
mand the channel, with the assistance
of a small naval force, and the war
vessels of Russia from Vladivostok
would find it no easy task to get
through the channel should they
wish to pass through the straits in
their desire to get into ,the Yellow
Sea.
Tsushima, or Tsuslma, as it is
sometimes called, consists of two lofty
wpoded volcanic islands in the strait
of Koiea, about midwav from Korea
and Kiushin. It . is about thirty-five
mils long and about twelve miles
broad. Its capital/ is Izunohara, sit
uated near its southern end. On the
west shore in 34 degrees 20 minutes
north latitude is a magnificent inlet,
nearly landlocked, with several minor
inlets, each capable of sheltering
whole fleets in deep water close to the
shore aitd communicating by a nar
row channel at high' water with the
east coast. The area of the islands
is about 270 square miles and the
population of 31,000. From Ko point,
its most southern extremity, to the
main island of Japan, it is about fifty
miles, and from its most northern
point to Korea it is about thirty miles.
From Nagasaki it is barely distant
100 miles. Being in this position,
Japan could use this island as a sort
of place to center troops . and then
with ease jump them into Korea, only
thirty miles distant, when opportunity
offered.
The fine harbor has*. been a sort of
way station in the commercial rela
tions between Japan and Korea.
It is rumored . that the Japanese
have been quietly fortifying the splen
did harbor there and that they have
practically an impenetrable fortress
there now.
Major C. A. Devol, quartermaster
of the transport service, in speaking
of the Japanese soldiers, said: "They
are a very tenacious lot, quick, active,
hardy and splendidly drilled. They
are cohesive and are certainly pos
sessed of great mobility. They re
quire very little food and a diet of
rice and dried fish is fully sufficient to
met their needs. They are . great
walkers and can easily march four
miles an hour without any exertion.
They may be small of stature and few
in numbers compared with the great
forces of the Russians, but in disci
pline, alertness and endurance they
will certainly give the soldiers of the
Czar a good tussle."

Meanwhile, as pointed out in Mr.
Bishop's article on "War Risks,' re
cently printed in this paper:
During times of peace a transfer of prop
erty may be made while the goods are In
transit, but In times of war this Is not the*
case, tor this would lead to fraudulent trans
fer of the enemy's property to neutrals In
order to avi>:<! capture. The ownership of
the property Is. therefore, deemed to continue
as It wan at, the time of the shipment until
actual delivery. Property shipped from a neu
tral to the enemy's country, under a contract
to become the property of the enemy on ar
rival, may be taken . In transit an enemy's
property, for capture Is considered as delivery.

"The Coptic, British steamer,* sailed
from this port January 15, with,.' as

LONDON, /Feb. . 9.â The Japanese
Minister, Baron Hayashi, said this aft
ernoon:
"Russia is making desperate efforts,
through the various embassies, to have
the powers intervene. Russia is now
willing to concede everything, but the
offer comes too late."
Baron Hayashi says the Japanese
fleet is not likely to blockade Port Ar
thur. His knowledge of the Japanese
naval plans, as tentatively reported,
leads him and others here to believe
that the Japanese fleet is now lying be
tween Chcfu and the Yalu River,
screening the landing of the troops
one arm:' corps at Fusan and two at
Penyang, Korea.
Night torpedo attacks on the part of
the Japanese fleet will, it Is believed, be
kept up so long as the Russian . fleet
maintains Its necessarily open position
outside of Port Arthur. This will be
done in the hope of breaking the Rus
sians' nerve..
The troops landing at Penyang will
be pushed toward the Manchurian fron
tier. Those at Fusan will proceed to
Seoul.
Unless Viceroy Aloxieff assumes the
aggressive no serious naval battle is
expected until the disembarkation of
the Japanese troops is completed.
â¢â  A disnatch from Rome saying that
the Japanese Government had pur
chased the Chilean battleship Capitan
Prat, the cruiser Chacahuco and the
gunboat Almirante Condell was pro
nounced untrue by Baron Hayashi. .
The Nippon company's London agents
have heard nothing of the alleged cap
ture of the steamship Inaba Maru near
Hongkong by Russian warships, as re
ported by a news, agency in the United
States to-day. It is asserted here that
Russia has no warships in x the vicinity
of Hongkong, and that, therefore, the
Inaba Maru cannot have been captured.

CRUSHING BLOW TO RUSSIA.
Consternation on Czar's Fleet After
the Japanese Attack.
LONDON, Feb. 9.â In a dispatch from
Chefu. dated February 9, a correspond
ent of the Da^ly Express says:
"The Japanese have dealt the Rus
sians a crushing blow at Port Arthur.
An advance squadron of the Japanese
fleet under command of Vice Admiral
Togo, and comprising sixteen battle
ships and cruisers, with a numerous
torpedo flotilla, left the main fleet off
Shantung Peninsula on Sunday, imme
diately when the news of the diplo
matic rupture became known. This in
formation was conveyed to the Japan
ese admiral by a destroyer dispatched
from Tsushima on Saturday evening.
"The Japanese scuuting cruisers had
given accurate information of the pre
carious situation of the Russian fleet
outside Port Arthur. The squadron
steamed slowly in battle formation on
Sunday at midday toward its goal and
came within sight of Port Arthur un
der cover of darkness. It continued
slowly outside without showing lights.
The Russians were lying in the road
stead, apparently, feeling secure from
attack. Nearly all the Japanese tor
pedo-boats were dispatched on their
dangerous and daring attack. They
rushed full steam on the enemy, who
were completely surprised.
A great rattle of small arms greet
ed the invaders, who. however, es
caped unhurt and the Retvizan. Cesar
evitch and Pallada were almost im
mediately torpedoed. The Japanese
dashed along the entire line of the
Russians exposed- now, to a terrible
fire from machine guns â¢ and small
arms from both the ships and the
shore. There was the utmost con
sternation among the Russians, which
probably accounts for the Japanese
torpedo-boats escaping practically un
scathed and rejoining the admiral
butside.
The admiral's fleet during the at
tack kept out of the range of the Rus
sian searchlights. Line of battle was
formed and the Japanese fleet moved
in within a range of two and a half
miles and opened fire on the Russians.
. The booming of gun3 was heard far
out to sea by the officers and crew of
a Japanese ship which has arrived
here. The battle is understood to be
still raging and the wildest reports
arc current. The Chinese population
of Chefu is in a frenzy of excitement
at the reports that the Japanese, who
they now regard as their friends,
scored the first victory.

ADMINISTRATION TAKES A HAND
IN THE FAR EASTERN SITUATION
Asks Powers to Join in Action to Prevent Either
Russia or Japan From Reaping the
Fruits of Victory.
WASHINGTON*,. Feb. 9.â Secretary j
Hay has addressed an Identical note
to a number of European powers to
ascertain if they are willing- to Join in
a notice to Russia and Japan that
during hostilities and thereafter the
neutrality and integrity of China must
be recognized.
Details of the note are not obtain
able in advance of the receipt of re
plies. It is known, however, that ex
changes already have taken place
which justify the State Department in
expecting favorable responses .to its
note. The matter has created a great
sensation in diplomatic circles here.
It is further learned that the propo
sition of the United States contem- i
plates a restriction of hostilities and I
the consequent hardships of war to j
the smallest possible area. Just what
this means is not made eleifr to the
public, but the determination may
have the greatest effect upon the [
struggle between Russian and Japan, j
It is almost certain that neither will t
be allowed to invade China proper. |
meaning by that that they may not i
with hostile intent go southward be- 1
low Shanhaikwan, on the border line!
between Chili and Manchuria. It is
a grave question whether or not it will
apply also to Korea, which is striving
desperately to preserve neutrality and
preve,nt invasion, but the general
opinion is that It is too late in that
case to do more than seek to preserve
Korean Independence after the war.
No explanation is accorded as to
whether Manchuria itself, already the
scene of the first battle off Port Ar
thur, is, being part of Chfna, regarded
as being within the scope of the prop
osition, but here, as in the case of Ko
rea, it is believed that the determina
tion will not be reached before the
close of the war.
The exchanges* referred to. as pre
liminary to the issue of the note, have
been going on for several weeks in
anticipation of an outbreak of hostili
ties. It was at first supposed that the
intention was to do no more than to
open the door in Manchuria, but it is
apparent that there is a deeper pur
pose and that from the original
thought the proposition has grown in
to one that will conserve the territorial
Integrity of China. It Is pointed out
that some such outcome followed the
Chino-Japanese war. so that, after all,
the present action is within the line of
precedence.
It is understood in regard to restrict
ing warlike operations to the narrow
est possible limits that the .proposition
took the form, of a note to Russia ana
one to Japan suggesting snme such
limitation. In addition, the powers
were called on by the United States to
address themselves in the same fashion
to Russia and Japan, and it is intimat
ed that these suggestions have been
well received.
PARIS. Feb. 9.â United States Em
bassador Porter called at the Foreign
Office to-day and conferred with Del
casse, the Foreign Minister. The prin
ciples of Secretary Hay's note to the
powers are identical to those which
have been the features of France's Chi
nese policy, but in view of the out
break of hostilities it is believed here
that Delcasse will want to Inform .him
self of the views of the other powers,
especially Russia, on this question be
fore definitely committing the French
Government.
SUPPORT FOR HAY'S PLAN.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 9.âAnnounce
ment may be expected from the State
Department, probably to-morrow, of
the hearty indorsement by the Euro
pean powers of the note of Secretary
Hay calling on them to take concurrent
action with the United States in its ef
forts to insure the neutrality of China
and to confine' the Japanese-Russian
war to these two combatants. A suf
ficient number of governments already
have been heard from, including Great
Britain, to insure the success of Secre
tary Hay's latest diplomatic move.
Japan, it can be stated on the highest
authority, welcomes the action of this
Government, and while up to a late
hour to-night the Russian position has
not been ascertained, officials of the
State Department feel confident the
representations of this Government will
be received with favor at St. Peters
burg. It is felt that any official word
on the subject would be imprudent at
present, but it can be said that unof
ficially it was known in advance that
Germany and Great Britain and France
and Japan were all anxious that the
neutrality of China be preserved.
Unofficial pourparlers on the sub
ject were exchanged and it was pointed
out by European diplomats that the
United States held the key to the situa
tion, being free from entangling alli
ances. At the Japanese legation the
principle for which Secretary Hay is
contending is heartily indorsed.
NEUTRALITY ' OF AMERICA.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 9. â A*t the
Cabinet meeting to-day long and care
ful consideration was given to the sit
uation developed by the Russo-Japan
ese war. It. is not expected that tha
United States Government will be
drawn into the conflict, although- Its
progress will be watched closely and
anxiously by this Government. Early
to-day the President and Secretary
Hay^fas well as Secretaries Taft and
Moody, were placed in possession of
the news carried by the press of the
naval conflict near Port Arthur. Prior
to the Cabinet meeting this was the
only information concerning the bat
tle which had been received by the ad
ministration. Dispatches from Minis
ter Allen at Seoul, Korea, received
this" morning, did not mention thÂ«>
naval engagement.
It was decided that the United States
should preserve absolute neutrality be
tween the combatants, but It is scarce
ly likely that a proclamation formally
announcing that decision will be made
until official advices ot the actual be
ginning of hostilities have been re
ceived. Admiral Evans' cruiser squad
ron will observe the naval operations
of the war.
The Cabinet also . discussed brjefly
the Panama canal situation, but no
Ir.f6rmtT.tion concerning the details of
the discussion were disclosed. ' *
Secretary Hay, who attended the
meeting to-day, is much improved In
health, and took an active part in the
deliberations.
Pleiades Safe In Port Arthnr.
CHEFU. Feb. 10.â The American
steamship Pleiades, . which sailed from
Seattle on January 2 with a cargo of
flour, has arrived at Port Arthur.
OKDEKS TO "FIGHTING BOB."
WASHINGTON, Feb. 9.â Orders were
cabled to-day to Rear Admiral Evans
to send his cruiser squadron, consist
ing of the Albany, New Orleans". Ral
eigh antl Cincinnati, from Subig Bay
to some point in Chinese waters yet to
be determined, for the purpose of ob
serving" the naval operations. It is ex
pected that the squadron can coal antl
get under way within two days.
Admiral Evans is expected fo keep
the battleship squadron in Philippine
waters throughout the period of hostil
ities between Russia and Japan. This
decision was reached at the Cabinet
meeting to-day after long considera-'
tlon. . It ha3 been definitely settled
that the cruiser squadron will not go
to Port Arthur.
Admiral Kvans is not instructed re
garding hip own movement, but it is
believed in naval circles that he will
transfer his flag to the Albany. -and
proceed northward with the squadron.
It is understood to-night that the
squadron will proceed from Sublg. Bay
to Hongkong and will not go farther*
north for the' present. In case no ex
ception is taken by either of com
batant powers, the feeling in naval ctr
cles is that the squadron should go on
to Chefu, so that the officers mav be ia
a position to observe the naval opera
tions. In case this is decided on sup
plementary orders will be cabled to>
Admiral Kvans.
McCpRMICK SENDS ADVICE.
Minister Finds Difficulties, In 'Getting
Accurate News.
, WASHINGTON. Feb. 'Xâ The Stata
! Department to-day received a cable
j gram from Embassador McCormick at
I St. Petersburg, confirming the press re
â  ports that three warships of the Rus
sian fleet had been damaged in an at
tack in the roads of the harbor at Port
Arthur by Japanese torpedo-boats.
The extent of the damage to the ves
i sols, it is said. Is unknown. This was
the first official information received
concerning the engagement."
McCormick suggests to the depart
ment that a complete telegraphic re
port of events in the Far East re
ceived in Washington will be of ma
terial assistance to him in interpreting
] the situation in St. Petersburg. He
j says that in the circumstances at St.
! Petersburg he is not able to comply
â  absolutely with the department's in
! structlons to keep it posted regarding
j developments of war in the Orient and
j indicates that it is impossible for him
j to obtain early and accurate news of

of foreign governments even for in

CAPTURING FIVE EVENTS AT INGLESIDE
Hildebrand Pilots
Three of the
Winners.
First choices in the betting display
ed no signs of bashfulness at Ingleside
yesterday, but Just helped themselves
to everything in sight.
There was one upset, when G. W.
Trahern defeated the odds-on favorite
P'erce J. ana this was the one occa
sion in which the slate was broken,
short-priced om-s annexing all the
other purt;es. The track was heavy,
and Murcsca, Eduardo. Ulctma, El
Piloto and Bombardier showed the con
fidence reposed in them was not ill
advised.
If Muresca could not win the open
ing six-furlong selling sprint it look
ed as if she should be consigned to the
tin can contingent. The mare out
classed her company shoes to plates in
the muddy groincr, and at odds of 4 to
5 won going away at the finish. Ad
irondack ran an indifferent second, a
ceck before Emily Oliver.
EDUARDO IS THE BEST.
Eduardo. from the Burns & Water
house stable, looked far and away the
l>est of those starting in the two-year
old scramble, and was installed a 4
to 5 choice. After a stormy passage,
during which be was cut off. bumped
and scared by a shadow, the son of
Kddie Jones won easily from Edith
Vice. Steel Wire was third.
Hildebrand spent no idle moments on
Ulctma, favorite for the five-furlong
Felling affair. The "Seattle Interur
ban," a 3 to 4 investment around post
time, made all the running, and was
straight as a Seattle sport at the wire
to beat Amasa a neck. Rustic Girl
downed Rollick for the show. This was
a pretty race throughout, and the as
sociation should see That some more
like it .are placed on the menu every
'day.
After Hullmans ridiculous ride on
Pierce J. the 4 to 5 favorite for the mile
and fifty yard run. that rider should
tit himself down on the ground for a
fortnight at least. At the start Shee
han went away in the lead with <J. W.
Trahern. a 20 to 1 shot, the favorite
and supporting company trailing. En
tering the stretch. Sheehan made a
wide turn, but Bullman astride the
favorite not to be outdone, went even
wider. On the better horse Bullman
finished second, beaten a length by the
rank outsider. Hildebrand saved near
ly a dozen lengths on the stretch turn
with Norford finishing a good third.
HILDEBKAND IX FORM
Simply by outfir.ishing Kunz on
Mimo. Hildebrand was enabled to put
El Piloto over the plate first in the
seven-furlong selling: number. At the
start, El Piloto, an even money fav
orite, was cut off, and this gave Kunz
an opportunity to steal away in the
lead with Mimo. Hildebrand hugged
the rail with the favorite, and finally
getting up on even terms with the
leader in the stretch, earned a nose
decision. LJyronerdale ran an improved
race, finishing a good third. Prince
Blazes ran as if he had never seen a
muddy track.
Ebony was reported to be coughing,
or coffin, one or the other, and his price
went from 6 to 5 to 8 to 5 in the bet
ting in the final Futurity course sprint
f<Â«r three- year-olds. The report must
have had some foundation, for Ebony
ran last, iust where all good 6 to 5
changes ought to run from a book
makers standpoint. The smart set un
loaded on Bombardier and with Hilde
brand up. the gelding scampered in
ahead of Red Bird and Riesca.
NOTES OF THE TRACK.
The $1000 handicap at one and a six
teenth miles is the feature event of the
card this afternoon.
G. W. Trahern, owned by Joe Quin
lan. winner of the fourth race, was bid
up from $400 to 1700 by E. Tierney. On
Monday Quinlan claimed Albemarle
from a race, and Tierney was simply
retaliating.

NEILL YIELDS
IN ONE ROUND
The Boxer Is Beaten by the
Dixie Kid in Oakland After
Two Minutes of Fighting
Al Neill was knocked out at the Se
quoia Club. Oakland, last night after
two minutes of fighting with Dixie Kid,
the colored boy from Los Angeles. Neill
might as well have been a bag of beans
for all the showing he made. The
fighting game is apparently not for him
any more.
The colored man opened the battle
at once and in a minute drove Neill
to the ropes with a couple of smashes
to the head and body. Another pair
of swings drove Neill again to the
ropes. The white man got out from
under and backed across the ring only
to be hurt with body smashes that
sent him to the floor. He stayed down
nine seconds and got himself together
lc-ngr^nough to withstand a bunch more
of driving rights and lefts. One terÂ»
rifle left to the stomach was followed
by a pair of drives that ended the flght
and settled XeiU as a fighting man.
The first blow landed by the "Kid" set
tled the fight. Neill appeared out of
condition. He was drawn, haggard
and lean.
Th^re was no excusV of an even
match between the men. "Spider" Kelly
was Neill's chief coach, but the long
second did not have, a, chance to say
a word or to make a motion. It was
over too soon.' "Biddy" Bishop second
ed "Dixie," who did not have to flght
hard enough to warm up. The crowd
was not sure why Neill was allowed
to go into the ring after seeing the
wretched showing he made.
Followers or the upon look for more
evenly matched contestants. One-sided
events of the character given last night
always leave. the doi/r open for doubt
and suspicion. This is not the first
fight conducted by the Sequoia club
that has been free from the showing
that causes Justifiable criticism of the
contests. The betting yesterday after
noon was at even money, but last night
the "Kid" was backed down to 6 to 10
favoritism. Phil Wand was referee of
the event. \
Spike Foley gat the decision over
Paul Crump in four rounds. Patsy Ho-
Ranand Joe Reilly fought a six-round
draw.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, .WEDNESDAY,: FEBRUARY 10, 100*.
HOBART PLAYS
IN GOOD FORM
Although Out of Practice and
Overweight He Shows to
Advantage on Polo Field
The English pbloists appeared on the
Burlingame Country Club field yester
day for the first time, but not In a
tournament match, as was expected.
They wanted an opportunity to -try out
their ponies before entering upon the
severe work which tournament play
involves. The game was fast, how
ever, and was full of desperate gallop
ing.
In order to accommodate all the
players the teams were changed three
times, each being allotted two periods
of play. The first lineup was:
REDS WHITER.
C Garland Captain Chaplin
T. A. Drlpcnll t N'ell Haig
W. K. Hobart F. J. Mackey
E. Ezra L. McCreery
Richard McCreery. referee, and Cyril Tobln,
timekeeper.
Basil V.Iliams, E. W. Horrard! Peter
D. Martin and W. A. McCreery appear
ed later In the game. At the end of
five periods of play the score was four
to four. â  %
Chief interest centered in the appear
ance of Captain Neil Haig and of Wal
ter Hobart. Although the latter waa
overweight and out of practice he
showed he was still in the game and
that with a little practice he will play
his old time game. He was unusually
well mounted.
Captain Haig filled all expectations.
He is the hardest hitter ever seen on
a California field and, despite his
weight, seems to take but little out
of a pony. His strokes are as sure and
as clean cut as those of a tennis player
and the ball is sent' a great distance.
The veteran F. J. Mackey comes back
this year a little ruddier of complexion
and a trifle more rotund of form, but
he is still the same desperate player.
Lawrence McCreery furnished the
surprise of the day. He picked the ball
out of a scrimmage in midfleld and ran
it across the field. He finally placed it
between the posts by a most difficult
shot at an odd angle. He was roundly
applauded by the players and the spec
tators alike.
The tournament game scheduled for
yesterday will be played this afternoon.
The second game will be played to
morrow as originally scheduled and
the deciding game on Saturday morn
ing. '
It was announced yesterday that
Charley- Dunphy, who, is the best Amer
ican player in the number one posi
tion, will not be able to play this year.
He collected a grand stable of ponies
and the disappointment both- to him
self and to his friends ls*.keen. He
would be pitted against Neil Haig in
a game and there is a general desire
to see him oppose the clever English
player in at least one match.
Chinese Substitutes Sentenced.
Lee Sing Gee, Yee Lee, Wong Sang
Quong and Lee Gun, who pleaded
guilty last Monday to having allowed
themselves to be substituted in the
Gamble-Dasha-Dempsey-Burnett case,
were sentenced yesterday by United
States. District Judge de Haven to
ninety days' imprisonment * in- the
County Jail and to pay a fine of $100
each. . .
There is something crooked in the
conscience that insists only on eccen
tricity. Hit^ .---;

Sir .Hugh, the favorite, came .through
and' vvon, Milas finishing -second and
Hotaage third. Flourish will not be al

The qualifying round, over eighteen
holes, medal play, of the competition
for the Council's Cup for women of
the San Francisco Golf Club was not
played yesterday morning on the Pre
sidio links. The ladies are just now
so much engrossed with, social gay
eties that a tramp over the links at
9:30 a. m. does not look good to them.
The competition, which is the. third
to be held for the trophy during the
present season, has been postponed to
a later date not yet fixed.
When you shut the eyes in prayer
you open the heart on heaven.

Harry de Windt Delivers Vivid
Lecture on His Attempt to
Find a Patli for Railroad
SUFFERS
PARTY
â¢'From Paris Jo New York, Over
land," Interestingly Pictur
ed, Pleases a Large Audience
Harry.de Windt. the well-known ex
plorer and traveler. lectured last night
at Lyric Hall on Eddy street. The sub
ject of the lecture was "From Paris to
New York Overland."
De Windt was one of six men who,
al'out three years ago, started from the
French capital in the interest of several
railroad promoters. The party con
fisted of six adventurers, who sought
to find the most feasible route for an
overland railroad between the two
cities that were the subject of his lec
ture.
Wh^n they started from Paris they
took the most northerly route through
Russia and th'en proceeded in almost
a direct easterly line through frozen
Siberia. The aim of the explorers was
to traverse the most northerly section
of Russia's territory. From' the time
of the entrance into Siberia, the party
suffered untold privations.
The provisions ran out and for weeks
at a' time the men existed solely on a
diet of frozen fish. Oftentimes the
r>h found would be in such a decayed
condition that it was almost sure death
to pat it.
The men suffered greatly from the
cold, but, kept doggedly on in their
march to the Bering" Sea. The journey
was one of the longest ever taken by
any explorer in the frozen north. De
AVindt and his men traveled up the
L.Â»na River, one of Siberia's Rieat ice
streams, for 'J000 miles. Horses and
sleighs were used. When the horses
could no longer be provided with food
th^y were discarded, and 1200 more
milfp was traveled with reindeer.
Fodder for the native animals of the
north became exhausted and for nine
days the parly traveled with dogs.
Several of the ni^n became sick and
at. Irkutsk, in the eastern part of Si
beria, three of them died and were
buried by their fellow travelers.
When the three remaining men. De
Windt. De Clinchamp and a English
man named Hardy, reached the Bering
Sea. they waited for days, seeking sijtnp
means of traversing the ice-blocked
sea. so that they might continue their*
.iournpy down through Alaska and
into the United States*. Finally a
revenue cuiter ,\vas sighted and the
three men were oarrk-d over the water,
to Alaska, from which point they made
tlipir way to this country and civiliza
tion.
Thp lecture was largely attended and
â¢Dp Windt held the audience, with his
narration of the hardships the party
endured. He told of the Siberian pris
ons and the manner !n which tho Rus
sian fxjles were treated. The lecture
was illustrated with a number of ex
cellent ster^opticon views taken by one
of the party.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY. FEBRUARY .10. 1004.
LINER GAELIC WILL CARRY FIVE TONS
OF SHOE NAILS FOR JAPANESE ARMY
Occidental and Oriental Steamship Sails To-Day for
the' Far East With Many Passengers and a Big
Cargo, Which Includes Quantity 'of American Flour
MUCH
The Occidental and Oriental Steam
ship Company's, liner Gaelic, Captain
Finch, will sail to-day for the Orient
with SSOO tons of cargo_ and a full list
of passengers. The cargo includes 1100
tons of flour and 400 tons of lead. The
lead'is consigned to Shanghai. Among

live tons of shoe nails for the quarter
master's department of the Japanese
army.
Amons the Gaelic's passengers will

flict as free lances.
Will Take Stores to Guam.
The *sh!:> Mary L. Cushing will sail to-day
for Guam with supplies for the naval station.
The store* will be llrhtered ashore on the
barge Emerald, which haÂ» been purchased
from Thomas CrOWl*F, ar.ti w*ll be carried to
the Fur Kast on the Cunning's deck. The.
Emerald Is something: of a looal marine
celebrity. She was the star attraction at the
na\al parade given on thÂ» bay In honor of the
First California Regiment when that organiza
tion returned- from the Philippines. L'nder
Crowley's deft direction the Emerald's box
like lines were hidden under artfully arranged
drapery and the Chlnepe lantern display, sus
pended from a couple of Jury masts, gave the
Emerald ' tlie aDnearance of an elaborately
decorated yacbt. The only drawback to the
yacht illusion was the Emerald's lack of
motive power; but. even towifcg behind a noisy
gasoline launch, the decorated lighter gained
an honorable mention In th? accounts of th.>
demonstration. One patriotic enthusiast went
so far as to charter the Emerald. He aban
doned ship, however, when he discovered liT
lack of motive power and climbed Telegraph
Hill to *ret a better and steadier view of the
parade.

DELAWARE WITNESSES IN
â¢BOTKIN" C.\SE ALJi HEADY
Question of Compensation for Two
Only Thing S:cnclius "Â» Way of
Their Departure.
District Attorney Byington received
a letter from Attorney General
cf Delaware yesterday informing him
that all the witnesses there in the case
of Mrs. Cordelia Botkin. charged with
th<? murdÂ°r of Mrs. Elizabeth P. Dun
ning at Dover, Dela.. by sending her
a box cf poisoned candy thioujrh the
mails, were in readiness to start for
California. Professor WolfT. who marts
an analysis- of the poisoned candy, and
Dr. Dowries, one of the physicians who
attended Mrs. Dunning prior to her
death, were still insisting, however, on
being guaranteed $1000 compensation
each besides their traveling expenses
and expenses at the trial.
In speaking of the letter, the Dis
trict Attorney said: '"I have not yet
heard from Governor Ilunn of Dela
ware in answer to my letter suggesting
that hi3 State should .bear a portion of
the expenses, as it did not contribute
one cent to the cost of the former trial,
even in view of the fact that Delaware
was as much interested in the convic
tion of the woman, charged with a most
atrocious crime, as California. Lntu
I hear from the Governor. I will not be
in a Dosition to know when I will bo
ready for irial and I hope that under
the circumstances a continuance will be
granted next Monday when the case 13
called for trial."
Garnett Writ Dismissed.
$ The application for "a writ of habeas
corpus for the release of Alexander Y>.
Garnett, charged with the murder of
Major J. W. McCIun-r. came up before
Judge Cook yesterday. The JudsÂ»

the ground that he had no jurisdic
tion. The application had been made
to Judge Seawell and assigned by him.
to Judge Cook, instead of by the pre
siding Judge. The arguments before
Judge Lawlor on the motions to dis
miss the information and appoint a.
t-ommicsion to take the deposition of
Mrs. LilliiMi Hitchcock-Coit in New

Wool Clip of 1903.
The faUcwios review of the wool trade fcr
trie year V*CZ '.s jriverj, by the National Asso

rerÂ».rt. just it-EUHl: 'The estimates of the

quantity of v.-ool produced this year as com

a shortage of 3o.u0G.CO0 to 40.000,000 i*>unds.
while come estimate It. to be a much greater
sjnount. All agree that the wool? In general
are ligrhu-r, poorer crown and more uneven
than last year, owing to lack cf forage and
f*verÂ«? weather. These conditions are reflected
in our estimate of average weight of fleeces
and thrir.kage. The average weight for the
who!Â«- country show* a rr-duetion from 6.50
pounds in 1902 to 6.25 pounds in 19<tf. The
falling off is mewt noticeable in the territorial
fctate*. and it Influences ir fome degree the
Quantity produced In most of the States and
Territories. On the basis of 39.284.000 sheep,
the quantity of wool produced, not Including

The Weather and Crops.
The weekly report of A. G. McAdie. section
director of the climate and crop service of the
Weather Bureau, is as follows:
GENERAL SUMMARY.
ThÂ« wealiier continued clear and froety dur
ing the *-arly part of the week and was followed
bv cooler, cloudy â¢weather, with rain In all
parts of the State and fairly heavy snowfall In
thÂ« mountain districts. High winds prevailed
In Â«oiae sections, but caused no damage.
ThÂ« precipitation was the heaviest of the
â¢eason In all the southern districts, and will
rrcbably improve conditions to such an extent
that with the customary later rains fair crops
cf rra.ln and hay will be harvested. Plowing
and seeding will be resumed Immediately. The
eattla range* had become dry and barren, and.
while the rain may rive a start to pasturage.
morÂ« moisture will be needed to make feed
plentiful. In the central and northern portions
of the State rÂ«ln wa* not fo badly needed, but
Its ocmins* will result In vastly Improved condi
tions of the soil. aÂ« well as of grain, hay and
paeturatre. The early nown irraln Is in pood
rendition, but Its growth has bÂ«en clow during
the cold weather, and the later sown has not
made e. satisfactory ehowlng for the wme rea
tna. Both would now be greatly benefited by
warm weather. The grain acreage In the Sac
ramento Valley Is reported considerably larger
than the* of la^t seaurn, and prospects are good
for heavy <~rcr>* cf wheat, oats and barley.
Work continue* In orchards and vineyards.
Â»nd deciduous fruit prc*r*Â»ct* are good in all
thÂ« central ar.d northern sections. The tree
Â«ad vine acreage Is being Increased In many
place*. There are no reports of damage by
frost to oranges cr fruit tree*. Almonds are
In blocra at Belmor.t.
Sacramento Valley. â Clear, warm weather
prevailed at the beginning of the week, followed
by cooler, cloudy weather and rain, with heavy
Â«now In the ! mountain districts. Frosts oc
curred frequently but caused no damage.
The early rain will prove very beneficial to
hctb early end late sown grain. The noil In
most places ie saturated to a good depth and
Is Ioose on the mirface. Early grain continues
ta excellent condition, but Its growth Is slow,
oV.-ing to cold weather. The acreage Is report
ed considerably larger than last season's, and
prospects are bright for excellent crops. Green
feed was becomii* scarce In eorne places, but
the rÂ«ln will *oon give it a new start. Hop
roots have withstood tbe cold very well and
are In good r-ond'.tlon. Deciduous fruit pros
pecu are excellent.
Coast and IJny Sections. â Clear. frosty
Tieaihtr continued in the flrÂ«t part of the week
and vet followed by cloudy weather, plente
ous rainfall In the valley?" and heavy enow in
the mountain districts. The rain will be of
Immense benefit, particularly In the southern
districts, where much of tbe early 6own grain
was rotting' In the ground and green feed was
tcarce. In the central and northern sections
rain was nr.t Â«Â«a<!ly needed, but It will Improve
:he condition *>f grain, pasturage and orchards.
Crops are nuking *>low growth, and warm
weather would be beneficial In all sections.
Plowing, teed ing and orchard cultivating are
progressing. The development of fruit bud*
has beed checked by the cold weather.
San Joaquin VaJley. â The weather was clear
anil cold during thÂ» fore part of the week and
clo-jfiy, with light rains, during the latter.
The rain w-sis badly rÂ«-#*ded and will be ' very
be:i*flcial. It was light In most portions of tbe
valley, but much heavier In the foothills. More
rain and warm weather are badly needed for
prasp anS grain. Early sown grain looks well
*n the northern portion of the valley, but has
made tlow growth, owing to the cool weather.
Plowing and teedn g continue in the northern
portion, atie. sinre the rains, summer fallowing
is progrcKFliis In the central and iwuthern sec
tions. Pruning and (leaning orchards and
vineyard* Block are in poor condi
tion. <mins> iÂ» -hÂ« scarcity of feed.
Southern CÂ»;ifornl*. â Clear weather contln-
OPd in The early part of the week, with fre
<juent tr-j**' la most places. HaJn commenced
fxlUr.r as the 4th and continued at Intervals
thfjuerh Â«noÂ«t of the week. Light snow fell in
the i:cur.'.r.:n CittActa. Tue rainfall was the
heaviest of the season, amounting to over an
Inch In nearly all sections, and if followed
by favorable weather and later rains will
probably .Insure fair crops of grain and hay
in many places. Plowing and seeding will be
resumed at once. Pasturage will be improved
ty the rain, but more Is needed soon, as the
ranges were very dry and barren. Citrus fruits
are In fair condition.
Eureka Summary. â Cold, rainy weather the
greater portion of the week. Feed is abundant
and grain very promising. Stock in good con
dition. Deep snow in the mountains and some
low down 'on the foothill?.
Los Angeles Summary.â Steady, gentle rains
the latter part of the week put the ground in
good conditicm for farm work, and will start
grain and feed growing. Should seasonable
rains follow good crops will be made.

EASTERN MARKETS.
New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Feb. 9.â The stock market
; went beyond the partial resistance to the de
pression which characterized It yesterday and
developed cositlve streneth to-day. In face cf
the continuance of depressing factors. The
lack of news of a favorable character to ac
count for the advance In prices drove observ
ers back to the conclusion that yesterday's
fall, comparatively cilght as it was consid
ered, was greater than was warranted by the
concurrence of the Baltimore fire with the
rupture between Rucsia and Japan. The violent
break of rtate fund* in foreigrn markets was
again accepted as a demonstration this morn-
Ing that there was a considerable element
abroad which had still clung to a slender
hope of nc-acc. even after the severance of
diplomatic relations, and whose hope was
blasted with the outbreak of active hostilities.
The effect on our market was scarcely percept
ible from the outset of the trading. The con
clusion has been reached apparently that no
harm to American Interests is to be feared,
directly or Indirectly, from the war. But a
more potent influence was a revulsion from
the fears caused by early extreme estimates
of the money loss from the Baltimore calamity.
The measures taken to postpone Baltimore's
settlements and .to extend credits promised
opportunities for arrangements to be made.
The share of Baltimore's reconstructive ex
penditure likely to flow Into the steel trade was
the explanation of the special demand for
United Statta Steel preferred, which carried It
nearly three points over last night, with a
noticeable effect on the whole market. The
stock market seemed equally Indifferent to
' the movements In the cotton market, thus
offering striking evidence of the change in
the terooer of speculation. The tone to the
moner market was firmer. There was a late
rumor of the placing of a $300,000,000 Russian
loan, and foreign money markets showed a
rising tendency. NevertheleE*. prices of the
leading active stocks here made gains of one
' to two points. _
Bonds were as free from pressure as stocks
and werÂ» disposed to advance. Total sales,
par value. *2.565,000.
United States bonds were unchanged on call.

Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO. Feb. 0. â The active speculative
demand which caused the sensational demand
in May pork came largely from shorts, who
had become alarmed at the seriousness of the
war situation. Commission houses, however,
were also heavy purchasers, several prominent
houses taking, 'On lines of. from 2500 to 5000
barrels. r&ckÂ«-rs reported an improved demand
for meats for foreign shipment. Higher 'prices
for live hogs at the yard* caused a firm open-
Ing in provisions". May pork being up 24c to
â¢ 4c at $13 7oÂ«?13 724- May lard was 5@74c
higher at $7 574Â©". 60, while ribs were 24c
higher at $6 85. On the placing of a large or
der for May )Â»rk by a prominent commission
house shorts staried to cover. Offerings were
extremely bmall, however, and in efforts to
supply their needs the price was forced rapidly
upward until It had touched $14 90. There
was some profit- taking at that figure, and a
reaction followed, but the close was at $14 70,
a net gain of .$1 024' for the day. May lard
closed 25<ff274c higher at $7 774*?7 SO, after
selling between $7 60 and $7 80. Ribs were up
30c at $7 12'/i. after ranging between ?6 8.*Â»
and $7 1'2'i. One feature of the sudden and
terteational a-.Iyanco In prices in May pork is
Frnall Ktocka of? barreled pork, which rendered
the market nervous and exceedingly suscepti
ble. There are only 20.000 barrels or pork In
Chicago. It -Aii.-! all sold here to-day, and
probably 35, COO barrels mow were disposed of
In the pit.
Opening of hostilities in the Far East had a
buoyant influence on wheat from the start.
Initial vales of May were Ut- to ?sc higher at
91 VsC to 94%c. with July at 84%Â®S4%c. Trad
ing was quiet in the early part of the session
and the i volume of business was much smaller
thfiji for some time paat. The quietness, how-,
ever, was due more to scarcity of offerings than
to* any lack of disposition to buy.
Commission houses had buying oÂ«tlerÂ« iand
the denl.ind from this source gradually forced
prices upward. The market became more act
ive later In the day and prices showed further
advances. An Improved foreign demand was
reported from the seaboard. The late market
wa* decidedly strong. After selling at 954c
May closed liftl^c higher than yesterday at
(P5QQ51&& Final figures on July were -at the
top at N6%c, a net gain for the day of 2140.
The feature In trading In corn was the act
ive demand from the principal bull leaders,
who wtrc heavy sellers yesterday. May corn
ranged between 52!ic and 54%@544c, closing
at the top. y
Oats afeo made a good advance In price, al
though the volume of trade was not large and
without significance. Closing prices were
strong and at the high point.

There was a rumor floating about the market
yesterday that Japan was making Inquiries as
to Hay purchases in this market, but there
was nothing definite about it. The disposition
was to pay as little about it as possible, for
some reason or other. If there Is anything in
It. It will probably develop In a day or so.
The market rules firm at the. high prices,
with a good consumptive demand, and 100 toris

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
Trade In Burbank Potatoes was quiet and
the market had an easier tone, as Jobbers were
well supplied and buyers were holding off In
anticipation of lower prices. The market, how
ever was otlll controlled ! by speculators and,
desu'lte- the light demand, there was no dis
position on their part to force sales and pre
vious prices "' were asked .for; all descriptions.
The steamer which was due from Oregon yes
terday was delayed and is net expected before,
to-morrow. River Reds were in good request
for export, and, as stocks were somewhat light,
prices had a sharp advance. â  It Is estimated
that fully 20,000 sacks of that description . havs
been shipped to Manila during the last two
months. Dealers reported a fair demand for
Early Rose and Garnet Chiles for seed, and
prices ' cf both were firmer. Sweets were ' In
clined to easiness and a freshly arrived carload
was offered at a decline.' Onicns were well
cleaned out of first hands and ruled firm at 2c
per pound." 'â  .
As UHual < on, Tuesday, receipts - of Los An
geles vegetables were very light and offerings
consisted largely of carrled-over stock. Peas.
Beans and Egg Plant were Jn limited supply
and ruled firm, while Tomatoes and Sumoier
Squash were plentiful and rather weak. There
were no Green Peppers or Wax Beans received.
Two boxes of Asparagus came in from tne
river and sold at 40c per pound. Rhubarb was
more plentiful and price* were shaded. Tne
Rhubarb growers across the bay have formed
an association and have decided to market
their crop* â¢ without the assistance of &fÂ«"Â»

among the Chinese fcr the approaching noii
days. Western was selling to arrive, and a
car which falls due to-day has been practically
sold out. A few case* of dressed Turkeys came

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
Receipts of Butter were considerably larger
vesterdny. being 503 boxes, and the market
was slightly lower again and quiet. There was
a demand for shipment to Interior points,
however, which has not heretofore existed,
and the decline In prices has made this out
ward movement possible. Dealers say that
they could do considerable shipping If tne
market were a cent or two lower.
There was a shipping demand for EÂ«gs, too,
the north being In the market for "ore or
ranch, according to price, the orders being
filled at 24Â®25c. This tended to neutralize the
unfavorable effect of the very heavy receipts
of 1343 cases, which Is about 200 cases more
than the previous high record this season.
The higher priced ranch trere not as active as
the lower grades, as they were not taken for
shipment, and they were quoted somewhat
The depression In Cheese still continues and
the market is still overstocked. Exporters say
that the Russian-Japanese war will probably
not affect the Oriental demand for Cheese on*
way or the other.
Receipts were 50.300 lbs Butter. 134o cases

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
The low prices of Oranges seemed to stimu
late the demand for that fruit nnd trade was
more active yesterday than for some weeks.
The demand was confined chiefly to the large
sizes of Navels, particularly 90s and 112s, and
turn offerincs of extra fancy fruit were firmly
held. There was the usual pressure to sell
small nnd medium sized fruit, but there was
very little doing '.n that line of goods. Tan
gerines were steady and the large sizes of
Grape Fruit were firm at the maximum quota
tion. Mexican Limes were firmer, as stocks
were closely cleaned up and there were very
few on the way to this market. Ten cars of
Oranges are announced for to-day's aucttan.

Meat Market.
There is very little chang* In the market.
The local butchers say that Beef and Mutton
are likely to bÂ« ecarce In thirty or sixty days.
They have lately been rushed Into market on
account of the dry weather and short pas
turage, which haa kept prices down for thÂ»
past three weeks, but as soon as these Cattle
and Sheep- are gone advanced quotations will
be^ apt to rule, especially if the pasturaga
proves sufficient to enable the stockmen to
carry the animals along.

SECRETARY'S ORDER PUTS
CUSTOM-lIOl'SK IX BLACK
Half Holldav on Saturdays Is Abol-
ished and Races Must Be linn
Without Federal Spectators!
Mourninir, symbolical mourning,
draped the Custom-house yesterday.
The corridors and stairways were
filled with gloom. The clerks retired
behind the black shadows of their
desks and swore softly, for the. fiat
had gone forth that they should work
henceforth from 9 a. m. until 4:30
p. m. every day, with a half hour for
lunch or luncheon, whichever they
might prefer. The half holiday <on
Saturday afternoon has been abolished
and instead of closing at noon on. Sat
urdays as heretofore the Custom
house must be kept open until 4:30
p. m. Â«.Â»n Sundays and lejjal holidays
the Custom-house will remain closed.
There is a ray of hope, however,
and that is that the unwelcome order
that came yesterday from the Secre
tary of the Treasury provides that in
States wherein Saturday has been de
clared by law to be a half holiday the
Federal force shall also take a half
holiday. There will be a combined
.movement on the part of the Federal
employes to secure the passage
through the next Legislature of a bill
making Saturday a half holiday, as is
the law !n several other States.

Wheeler and Attorney Charles E.
Snook attended a session of the Board
of Regents at Mark Hopkins Institute
yesterday afternoon. Regent Earl was
called to the chair. Lieutenant (Govern
or Anderson called attention to the fact
that A. G. Fisk had resigned the office of
Speaker of the Assembly and asked if
Assemblyman Henry E. Carter, Speak
er pro tern., was a Regent. Mr. McEner
ney suggested that the question be sub
mitted to the Attorney General, and
such reference was made.
President Wheeler advised the board
that many illustrious educators would
attend the summer school at Berkeley.
The list includes Professor Fred
erick J. Turner of Wisconsin. x Dr.
Archibald Coolidge of Harvard and
Professors Bernard Moses and H.
Morse Stephens of California.
AN KXTEXSI VK* TRAVELER.
Professor Cooiidge is the- foremost au
thority in the United States on the
Eastern qutfetion. Dr. Coolidge, though
still a young man, has traveled exten
sively in Europe and Asia and has held
seme important governmental posi
tions. When the trans-Siberian Rail
road was opened last year he was the
first traveler to make the entire trip
across the Asiatic Continent. After
reaching the terminus of the line he
crossed through Korea and went to
Peking. â¢
Dr. Coolidge is preparing a book on
the Eastern question and one of the
inducements which brings him to Cali
fornia is the library on Russian ques
tions in the possession of Jerome B.
Lanfield. instructor in history at the
university. His course of lectures will
treat of the European aspect of the
Eastern question; also of Russian ex
pansion and the extension of Russia's
control over Central Asia.
Professor Turner is an authority on
American history and will devote him
self to the exposition of that subject.
He has had great success in teaching
history and for six years the Justin
Winsor prize of the American Histori
cal Association has been annually
awarded to one of his pupils. lie has
written a number of short studies in
American history.
Professor Stephens will give a sen- j
eial course on the teaching of history'
and another on the Elizabethan peUod.
Professor Moses will give a general
course on government and a special \
course on Philippine institutions.
A provision in the report of the ft-]
nance committee authorizing an ap- ;
propriation of $4000 to enable thc,unl-|
versity to make an exhibit in the-pal- I
ace of education of the St. Louis Expo- 1
sition was debated at some length and ;
finally approved. j
Regent Slack expressed a desire to. :
hear the president's version of the. pro
posed exhibit. Dr. Wheeler said the v
exhibit wduld consist of relief, maps, ;
Lick Observatory photographs, J
The astronomical work at Lick Observ- :
atory was recognized by the eminent
experts as the best in the world. j
APPROPRIATION" FOR EXHIBIT. <
In the general discussion Regents Me- !
Enerney, Ellinwood, Britton, Wheeler, !
Taussig, Waymire, Dohrmann and An- .
derson participated. Mr. McEnerney j
remarked that the Legislature had ap- !
propriated $130,000 for making aCali- j
fornia exhibit at the St. Louis Exposi- ;
tion. The commission proposes to al- '
low $1000 for transporting and install
ing an oxhibit and the university is to j
give $4000. He doubted whether the
regents had authority in law to ex- |
pend $4000 for promoting immigration, â¢
as the money provided for the admlnis- j
{ration of university affairs is a trust j
fund.
The fact was mentioned in remarks
by Mr. Dohrmann that San Francisco
was raising m(vney for an exhibit. It
was a topic of comment that the com
mission having an appropriation . of
$130,000 could give San Francisco noth
ing and could allow the University
only $1000.
Regent Slack, after a reflective survey
of the situation, came to the conclu
sion that the appropriation of $4000 by
the Regents, could be justified on the i
broad proposition of spending money |
for the enlightenment of the world. j
It was incidentally mentioned in the [
discussion that the Governor of the â 
State favored the university exhibit.
When the roll was called all the Re- |
gents present, save McEnerney, voted
to appropriate the money. !
John A. Britton of the finance com
mittee was authorized " to sign < for
President Wheeler during the latter's
absence from the State.
Regents Earl and Britton were added
to the committee on buildings and
grounds.
The finance committee was author
ized to go ahead with the work of re
covering money due the university by
reason of tho McKowen defalcation.
A motion made by Regent Britton. re
questing the treasurer to file a report
of receipts ar.d disbursements at each
regular meeting, was withdrawn when
the information. was elicited that a re
port up to January 31 had been filed
and was in the hands of the secretary.
The finance committee asked for fur
ther time in. the selection of a secre
tary and the request was granted.
Chamber of Commerce Meet*.
At the monthly meeting of the
Chamber of Commerce, held yester r
day. F. W. Zeile, R. Onffroy, J. F.Hal
loran and the . California Canneries
Company were elected to membership.

ment . to the Alaska fisheries law, the
retention of Goat Island as a naval
training station, the construction of a

YOUNG MATRON
ENDS HER LIFE
Only a Year Married, 3Irs.
Lola Chambers Becomes De
spondent and Inhales Gas
Despondent because she believed her
husband to be untrue to her and ren
dered desperate by his threat to aban
don her, Mrs. Lola Chambers, who had
just passed her twentieth year, made
an end to her existence yesterday
morning at her home, 84 Harriet
street.
When the body was found several
hours later a note was clasped in her
riKht hand. It was in her own writ
ing and rend as follows:
My Dear Husband: You will no doubt bs
surprised when you arrive and flni miÂ» a
corpse, but 1 will pay I have gone the limit
and can't stand any morÂ«\ I hope you will
always be happy, but rfmember thÂ» onÂ» jou
have put In misery. Your once lovlns wife,
LOL.A CHAMBERS.
The room was full of illuminating
gas, that had escaped from an open
burner. â¢
The man to whom the note was ad
dressed was Frederick Chambers, who
is employed by his brother, the pro
prietor of a cigar stand at Jackson
street wliarf. He had married his un
fortunate wife a year ago last Decem
ber. He said to Deputy Coroner
Brown yesterday that his wife was
jealous of him. because he used to
dress himself in his best suit and go
out in the evenings; that she accused
him of being unfaithful to his mar
riage vows; that after a quarrel be
tween them last Monday night they
agreed to separate and that he left the
house and did not return until after 9
oMlock the following morning, some
time after his wife's body had been
found in her room.
When asked where he had snent the
night he refused to answer.
The couple lived with Mrs. Nellie
Font, a sister of Chambers. Mrs.
Font told the Deputy Coroner that
Mrs. Chambers came to her for the
key of her room at 1 o'clock yester
day morning and then locked 'herself
in her own apartment. She had left
the house shortly after her husband
had gone away on Monday evening
and she did not return until between
midnight and 1 o'clock In the morn-

GETS NOTHING
FROM ESTATE
Xatqrai Son 6f Jose Maria
dc Laveasra Is Defeated in
the Struggle for a Fortune
A. J. M. de Laveaga is not entitled
I to any share in the $2,000,000 estate left
by Jose Vicente do Laveaga. according
' to a decision rendered by the Supreme
Court yesterday. The case has been in
: the courts for about eight years. A. J. I
; M. de Laveaga was the natural sen
of a brother of the deceased capitalist,
and, asserting that he had been legally
adopted and acknowledged by his fa
ther, claimed a quarter interest in the
rich estate. The lower court decided in
favor of the claimant, but that judg
ment is reversed. The two slaters and
a brother of the decedent presented the
appeal.
Jose de Laveaga, the elder, brought
his family to San Francisco from Ma
zatlan, Mexico, in 1867. His children
were Maria Josefa Cebrian. Maria C.
de Laveaga, Miguel A., Jose Vicente
and Jose Maria de Laveaga. The pa
rents of the claimant were Jose Maria
de Laveaga and Basil ia Sanchez, a ser
vant t)f the family.
,The Sanchez woman returned to Ma
.zatlan. where the claimant was born in
1868. His mother died four years later
and he was brought to San Francisco
through the instrumentality of his fa
ther in ISTS'and placed in the care of
Dr. Wilhelm Dohrmann at 535 Bryant
street, rz-^'
Jose Maria de Laveaga died in this
city in 1SS7, leaving a will. In which he
declared that the claimant was his son.
Jose Vicente de Laveaga, whose estate
is involved in the case at bar, was the
executor of his brother's will, but never
published the acknowledgment of the
parentage of the claimant. It apr-.ars
from the evidence that the boy had
been known as Jose Sanchez, Jose
Dohrmann and William Dohrmann. He
based his claims for a share of the es
tate on the assertion that he had been
formally recognized as son the
brother of the deceased. /
The Supreme Court declares that the
boy was never publicly acknowledged
by his father. It is pointed out that if
no distinction is made between legiti
mate and illegitimate children a terri
ble blow will be struck at the family
and the marital relation. It is said that
had the claimant ever. lived in his fa
ther's family or had he been commonly
known as the son of his father, a dif
ferent conclusion might have been ar
rived at. . -
Thfc opinion is written by Justice Van
Dyke, with whom Justices Shaw. Hen
shaw, Angellotti. Lorigan and McFar
land directly concur.
The court particularly refrains from
deciding whether a natural . child
can inherit from collateral kin. If for
mal acknowledgment of the offspring
is made by the parents.
Miss Redmond Sues Her Father.
Kate L. Redmond yesterday filed a
suit for an accounting against her
father, Dennis Redmond. She alleges
that in December, 1902, while she was
in Honolulu, her father took advan
tage of her absence and secured a lease
of propertyin which for -years ho had
held a leasehold interest. She siy.i
that since that time he hns enjoyed
the rents, issues and profits of tlio
premises,' which are located on Sixth
street, near Harriet, and refuses to uc
count to her for them.-
