Â£p*cl*l Dispatch to The Cm.ll.
NEWARK, N. J.. Feb. 19â "I bore my
children no malice," was the statement
to-day of Mrs. Alice Grover Lioux, who
deliberately killed her two beautiful
little girls by gas asphyxiation in their
tome' in Eloomfield a week ago. She
la now physically restored by treat
ment in the Mountainside Hospital,
whither ehe was taken unconscious
from, the room where her children lay
dead. t
Alienists will examine Mrs. Loux and
meantime an investigation is being
made of her antecedents, to ascertain
if a taint of insanity afflicted the
family. To those who have talked with
her, her astounding confession relating
to the murder of her children seems
incredible. In her own words, it was
her love for Minnie Augusta, aged four,
and Elsie May, eighteen months, which
impelled her to kill them. She is re
signed to paying the death penalty for
her crime. . â¢
Thrice she snatched the little ones
from the very gates of death, but each
time she returned to the self -applied
sacrifice, Impelled by what she had
convinced herself was her awful duty.
.When the charge of murder was read
io-Mre.. Loux and â¢*â â¢*â  â wwdsâ^with
xnaiice'* were pronounced, she inter
rupted:
led them, but it was not through
Ul-wUL It was because I did not want
them to live and suffer as I have suf
fered."
Mrs. Loux says she had long had in
mind the death of her children. When
her husband left her alone with the
children to stay two days at Atlantic
Highlands, she set out to accomplish
her plan. She bathed the children and
put them to bed and at 11 o'clock at
night turned or. the gas in their room.
She declared that the sight of their suf
fering impelled her to repeatedly turn
off the gas and open the windows.
Finally, "in order that the children
might not suffer when I again turned
on the gas, I gave to each a large dose
of paregoric and they soon fell asleep,"
ehe said. "I turned the gas on full. I
did not dare to glance at my darlings
for me time for fear I might again
falter. When the clock struck 11 I
â¢went to the crib, and I could see that
my loved ones were dying. I was be
6ld^ myself with grief, and a desire to
take them up and save them over
powered me.
"That moment I became faint. I fell
â¢upon the bed and can remember star
ing at the celling, powerless because of
the deadly gas fumes, to save my
darlings. I knew nothing more until I
awoke in the hospital."

NEW YORK, Feb. â The mate

It is of an entirely new design and
new shade. Mrs. Roosevelt suggested
the new design and shade, and it will

President's daughter.
While admiring the new shade,
which comes near to an electric blue,
Mrs. Roosevelt conceived the idea that

the design was completed according
to her ideas it represented a flock
of doves flying diagonally across a

a little larger than two Inches from

LOS ANGELES, Feb. 19. â O. C. Tsh,
a chauffeur in the employ of the
Worthington grarage, was the victim
last night of a murderous assault by
two robbers, who, believing they had
killed their victim, made their escape.
Yesterday afternoon two well
dressed men entered the garage and
engaged a public automobile. They
â were taken by Ish to the country
south of the city, where they stopped
at a roadhouee and pretended to
transact some business. It was dark
when they started to return. When
five miles south of Los Angeles the
man upon the rear seat struck Ish
upon the head with a blackjack and a
moment later the other man struck
him with the heavy crank used to start
the machine.
Realizing that he was about to be
robbed and fearing that the men
might ruti away with the machine, Ish
turned it into a ditch. He remembered
no more until he regained conscious

Class.
Special Digpatch to ThÂ« Call.
NEW YORK, Feb. 19. â The pupils
of John D. Rockefeller Jr.'s Bible class
in the Fifth-avenue Baptist Church to
day learned from Rev. R. P. Johnson,
pastor of the church, something about
the value of oil, the minister taking
for his text the parable of the foolish
virgins. His references to oil led to
considerable suppressed mirth.
"In this class," said the minister,
"we try to teach spiritual truths by
business and commercial examples,
and, taking this parable as a lesson
for every day business life, you must
bear in mind that a man should have
some oil in his lamp. The man who
har no oil is not ready. You may have
ycur own views about what oil means
ir. this parable. There is no favoritism
about this â it is natural law. So I im
plore you all to get ready If you are
not now so, and. like the five wise vir
gins, have enough oil in your lamps
so that they will be ready for use when
the time comes."
There were present 137 members of
the class. A letter from John D.
Rockefeller Jr., dated "Cannes, France,
January 29," was read, in which the
writer praised a sermon he had heard
in a French church. The minister
urged his hearers to attach themselves
to Christ.

Fifteen Russian navy officers who
Bhared in the defense of Port Arthur
and who left that stronghold as pris

once despised as foes unworthy of Rus

terday on the liner Siberia. They are

to the gracious courtesy of the Jo.p

According to the disoatches Russian
officers on their way home by other

Senator Clark Has
Bout With Slot
Machine.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. Feb. 19.â United States
Senator W. A. Clark of Montana won
a victory over a stubborn penny-in
the-slot machine at the Fourth street
station of the Subway this afternoon.
Senator Clark was first noticed at the
station when he was trying to jam a
nickel into the machine. The nlcktl
would not go, of course, and an alert
station attendant informed him of the
fact, adding:
"You can get pennies at the window.
Senator."
The man called "Senator" went at
once to the ticket window, procured
the necessary coppers and returned to
the slot machine. A few minutes later
an angry protest came from him.
"This thing Is a swindle." he com
plained to the guard. "I have put in
my penny and it does not work. It is
out of order. It is not right to have
such things here."
The guard ran to another guard, who
told a special policeman, who informed
one of the ticket office men. In another
moment the four men were anxiously
working the little drawer, shaking the
entire mechanism and trying to kick
the post out of plumb. All the time
the Senator stood to one side, declaring
it was an outrage. One northbound
train after another passed, but the
Senator heeded not. At last, after ten
minutes, the machine was induced to
disgorge one attenuated piece of gum.
which Senator Clark received with
great satisfaction.

warehouse, where a seasoned stock of
fireworks was located, several serious
explosions occurred.

Within a few minutes the east wall
fell across Meridian street, completely
blocking traffic, but no one was hurt.
The first intimation of a fire was
received when a watchman saw the
windows on the second and third floors
of the east front of Fahnlev & Mc-
Crea's building burst open, allowing
sheets of flame to escape into Meridian
street. A general alarm was turned in.

FEAR HOLDS THE RUSSIAN GRAND DUKES
CAPTIVE IN THEIR SUMPTUOUS PALACES
Afraid to Venture Forth to Attend Services
in Memory of Sergius, ,
Assassinations of
Minor Officials
Continue.
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 50.â 1t has
now been definitely decided that the
remains of Grand Duke Sergius will
rot be brought to St. Petersburg for
the present, but will be placed in a
temporary receiving vault of the clois
ter of the Chandoff monastry to await
the completion of alterations now in
progress in the Romanoff mausoleum
in the fortress of St. Peter and St.
Paul. On account of lack of space in
the mausoleum it was decided last year
to bury only rulers of the dynasty in
the old mausoleum and a new se
pulchre in the new wing of the cathe
dral is being built for other members
of the imperial family.
So grave is the danger of a repeti
tion, of the Moscow tragedy that sev
eral t>f the Grand Dukes have not
stirred out of their palaces since the
murder, and. Instead of going to
Tsarskoe-Selo to attend the requiem
there, they have participated in spe
cial services held in the chapels of their
own palaces.
Dispatches from the interior say that
requiems for the Grand Duke have
been held throughout Russia.
The public is greatly concerned over
the developments of the immediate fu
ture. According to reports many cit
ies and towns are in a condition of po
litical ferment and several officials
have been assassinated â¢in Southern
Russia. According to a telephone mes
sage from Moscow the students there
are afraid to appear on the streets in
their uniforms.
In addition the strike situation has
again grown menacing, especially in
the matter of the railroads, three of
which entering Moscow are almost en
tirely tied up.
In St. Petersburg the strike has as
sumed the form of a lockout, the Puti
loff Iron Works, the Franco-Russian
Works, the Russo-American Rubber
Works and a few smaller concerns
having discharged all their employee
with the notice that the works will be
shut down indefinitely. Consequently
there are many alarming reports afloat
as to what the men will do.
With 30,000 to 40,000 men out of work
for an indefinite period, even if no
more join the ranks of the idle, rioting
and collisions with the police are
feared.
The closing of the Franco-Russian
and the Putiloff Works is a serious
embarrassment to the Government, as
the former is engaged exclusively on
navy work and the latter in manufac
turing guns and munitions of v,ar for
the army. More than 25,000.000 projec
tiles and shrapnel are being prepared
tA th^ Putiloff Works and the Gov
ernment has been compelled within the
last ten days to Dlace orders in France
and Germany for $135,000,000 worth of
munitions.
At the Government-own"d Nevsky
Works the Minister of Finance has
been able to hold the men onJy by con
ceding: everything they hay- 5 'lemanded,
including the eight-hour day.
TOKIO PRESS COMMENT.
Kii--i;ui Autoorary to Blame for Era
ul Vssassinations.
TOKIO, Feb. 19. â Commenting on
the assassination of Grand Duke Ser
gius in Moscow the Jiji Shimpo ex
presses its horror at his cruel death,
but declares the action is attributable
to the high-handed manner of the
Russian Government In suppressing
the recent labor demonstrations. The
paper says that oppressive measures
against expression of national wishes
invite such outrages from the op
pressed.
"The war in the Far East resulted
from aggressive action of the Rus
sian Government, with which the Rus
sian people have little sympathy,"
thp Jiji Shimpo adds. "In one sense
Japan is waging a war against the
Russian nation arising from oppres
sion by the autocracy, but Japan iÂ»
fighting the Government and not the
people of Russia."
The paper predicts a better under
standing, with increased sympathy beÂ»
tween the two peoples, after the war
has ended, and, after lamenting the>
crime which resulted in the death of
Grand Duke Sergius. expresses the
hope that it will be fruitful of good
results.
Other newspapers comment in a
similar strain on the assassination of
the Grand Duke.

MURDERER'S
IDENTITY NOT
ESTABLISHED
MOSCOW! Feb. 19. â A thin layer
of snow to-day has dimmed the blood
stains in the Senate square. The win
dows of the Palace of Justice have
been reglazed and other hasty efforts
havo been made to obliterate traces
of Friday's tragedy. Evidence, how
ever, is being found in most unex-
pected places. Soldiers this afternoon
discovered rnahy pieces of the car
riage in which Grand Duke Sergius
was riding when he met his death, and
fragments ol ilesh were found on the
top of the twelve-foot parapet of the
arsenal, among the Napoleonic guns.
Until tiie funeral, which has been
fixed for Thursday, February -3, the
remains of Grand Duke Sergius will
rest in the ancient dining-room of the
Chaudoff, Monastery, to which
throughout the day the people of
Moscow have been ad,mitted in parties
of one hundred to pay their last re
spects. This precaution was taken
because it Was thought necessary to
avoid the possibility of demonstra
tions.
The assassin remains persistently
silent. His identity has not yet been
established, and although the police
have been trying diligently they have
been unable to find any clews to any
possible accomplice.
The assassin's papers and clothing
offer no means of identification, and
his pass evidently was forged and ap
pears never to have been issued. His
photograph has been taken, to be dis
patched to all the universities, but it
th*- assassin is actually a workman
and not a student the police may find
themselves at sea.
Grand Duke Sergius' coachman,
who was believed to be dying at the
time of the affair, is still alive and

DENOUNCES THE ASSASSINS.
Russian Pastor Says They Retard
Liberal Tendencies in Fatherland.
NEW YORK, Feb. 19. â In the Rus
sian Cathedral of St. Nicholas a "pan
n:chida," or requiem mass, for the
Grand Duke Sergius of Russia was
celebrated to-day. The scene was
most impressive, as the great congre
gation, holding lighted candles, re
sponded to the chants of the black
robed priests officiating at the cata
falque, which had been placed in the
center of the edifice.
Rev. Alexander Hotovitzky, the pas
tor, in his sermon said that the assas
sination of the Grand Duke Sergius
was a sad blow against the real free
dom of Russia; that the act of the
assassin would not bring about a bet
terment of conditions, but that vio
lence would retard the liberal tenden
cies of that country: that the act fur
thermore was not perpetrated by Rus
sians or by men who had the welfare
of Russia at heart, for no real patriot
would throw a mob into the Kremlin,
which is a sacred place.
Russia, said the preacher, was
maligned and calumlnated throughout
the world. Many of the infamous
charges against the Russian Govern
ment were wholly untrue and other
occurrences were exaggerated for po
litical purposes.

MEXLO PARK, Feb. 19.â Dr. Ira G.
Hoitt â  hI to-day at his residence in ;
Menlo Park. He was born in Lee,
N. H.. seventy-two years ago.
In the passing of Dr. Hoitt Cali- '
fornia has lost one of her veteran edu
cators. Dr. Hoitt graduated from
Dartmouth in 1860. He left the Boston i
English High School in 1864 and came '
to San FrtinciÃCO, where he immedi
ately entered the School Department.
He was the first principal of the :
Lincoln School. He gathered a well ,
equipped library for the use of the
school and established the Lincoln ;
School medal fund. In 1880 he was
elected to the State Legislature and as
chairman of the Conn.iittee on Educa- !
tion did much to improve the school '
laws. In 1884 he was elected to the
San Francisco Board of Education and i
served as its president for two terms. !
In 1886 he became State Superintendent j
of Public Instruction and during the ;
four years of his incumbency the
schools throughout the State felt the !
impetus of his remarkable enererv and
enthusiasm.
Eighteen months ago Dr. Hoitt suf- i
fered a slight stroke of apoplexy. It !
was the beginning of the end. for he j
never rallied from the shock.
The funeral of Dr. Hoitt will be held
to-morrow from the First Unitarian |
Church, San Francisco.
PRISONERS MAY
BE EXTRADITED
WASHINGTON. Feb. 19.â The De
partment of Justice has received a
copy of the decision of the Judicial
Committee of the English Privy Coun
cil in the Gaynor-Greene case, ren
dered on February 8, the main points
of which were outlined in the press at
the time. The decision was favorable
to the United States and will result in
a reopening of the extradition pro
ceedings in the Canadian courts
against Gaynor and Greene, who are
technically charged with obtaining
Government money under false pre
tenses.
The judgment of the Privy Council,
as understood here, after a full perusal
of its opinion, is that the two Judg
ments of Justice Caron dismissing the
motion of the United States to quash
writs of habeas corpus in favor of
Gaynor and Greene were erroneous;
that the writs should have been
quashed because the prisoners were
held under proper arrest and detention
by a competent tribunal.
The Privy Council does not agree
with Justice Caron that, because the
United States charges a conspiracy
which is not an offense within the
extradition treaty, the prisoners were
entitled to discharge. The Privy
Council points out that the indictment
for conspiracy covers the acts of lar
ceny which is an offense under the
extradition treaty. The United States
could therefore treat this alleged lar
ceny as a distinct and independent ex
traditable offense.
Justice Caron, the council holds, in
effect should have allowed the extra
dition proceedings and particularly the
question of how much evidence there
was of larceny to be duly and prop
erly investigated under the British
statute without interference by him.
About half of the opinion rendered
by the Privy Council deals with the
proceedings in the case up to the time
that Justice Caron took a hand In it.
The opinion speaks in rather caustic
terms of Justice's Caron's action, say
ing that he ultimately discharged the
accused from custody upon grounds
which their lordships have some diffi
culty in following

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 19.â T0-morrow
at 11 o'clock the special Senate com
mittee that has been Investigating the
charges of bribery against Senators
Emmons, French, Bunkers and Wright
will report its recommendations. Upon
the best of authority it is said that the
committee will recommend that all of
the accused be expelled from the floor,
never again to hold an office of public
trust. That the Senate will carry out
the recommendation to the letter there
is no question, but a furious debate is
sure to xirecede this action.
Senator Savage has announced that
under no circumstances will he vote
to expel the accused. "I do not care
if the whole world is against them,"
he said yesterday, "I will not vote to
expel them because I do not feel that
they have been given a fair oppor
tunity to defend themselves. Had they
been sworn and failed to clear them
selveÃ it might have been different."
Senator Selvage, who defied the press
and public opinion in his last speech
in favor of the boodlers, will also make
another address on behalf of the ac
cused. He took copious notes during
the argument in Judge Hart's court
yesterday and it is said he will use the
points made by defendants" counsel in
his last effort to save them from the
fate that seems to be inevitable.
The investigating committee held its
last meeting to-night for the purpose
of preparing its findings. Chairman
Belshaw and Senators Simpson and
Diggs were present, Ralston and Row
ell being absent, but they had already
voted upon the matters to be con
tained in the report, which will be
unanimous. The report will contain
about 600 words.
"Well, we are glad we have con
cluded our work," said Senator Bel
shaw after the adjournment of the
meeting late to-night.
"But we are not through yet," said
Simpson. "There is no question but
that queries will be hurled at us thick
and fast to-morrow and that we will
also have tV take an active part in the
debate on our recommendations."

POPE TO USE
AN AUTOMOBILE
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ROME, Feb. 19.â 1t is the intention
of the Pope to equip the Vatican Ob
servatory with the Marconi system of
wireless telegraphy, and it is known
that only recently Pius X sent word to
the wireless inventor that a visit from
him would be very acceptable. Pius X
is much interested in recent inventions
and has made a special study of the
telegraph and its recent improvements.
The interest that Pius X takes in mod
ern inventions was distinctly exempli
fied when he recently ordered linotype
macines tor- the Vatican printing of
fice.
The latest study taken up by the
Pope is that of the automobile. Sev
eral companies recently offered to sup
ply him with costly machines, but he
refused to lend his name for advertis
ing purposes and instructed Cardinal
Ferrari to send to the Vatican the
manager of a well-known automobile
factory of Milan. With him the Pope
placed an order for two of the latest
type for his personal use in the Vati
can gardens.
DISPERSED BY POLICE.
NEW YORK. Feb. 19.â Police re
serves were called out to-night to dis
perse a crowd collected to express sym
pathy with the Russian revolutionary
party. Eight men were arrested, all
giving foreign names and charged with
parading without a permit, collecting a
crowd and holding an unlawful meet-
Ing.
The trouble started when two police
men came upon a crowd cheering and
applauding a speech made by one of
their number. The policemen were un
successful in dispersing the people and
called for the reserves.
It was said that a red flag was being
waved and later a sergeant of police,
who assisted in the raid made the
statement that on one of the men ar
rested was "inflammatory and revolu
tionary literature." This man's name
was given^as Albert Argentier, and the
police found on him a subscription list
for the Russian revolutionaries. All
the men arrested said they were tailors
and protested against being taken into
custody.
Argentier demanded to know if this
city was to be like Moscow and honest
workingmen denied the right to meet
and denounce tyrants.
"You can meet all right." said the
sergeant in charge, "but not in the
street where the meeting might turn
into a riot and a lot of people get
broken heads. Obey the law and we
will not molest your meetings."

DESTRUCTIVE
RODENTS MAY
CAUSE STRIFE
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 19. â If an
anti-gopher and squirrel bill now be
fore the Assembly becomes a law the
busy little rodents that will persist In
being numerous and irrepressible will
start an epidemic of litigation among
the farmers of the State that may
cause the wrecking of fortunes and the
breaking of friendship bonds that
have been stout and strong for years.
The bill i s fathered by Burge and
Stanton. Under its provisions prop
erly constituted inspectors may enter
upon any land, kill off the gophers and
squirrels and charge the bill up to the
land invaded.
The measure provides that it shall
be the duty of every person owning,
claiming or occupying land to keep
such land clear ot gophers and squir
rels and that failure to do so shall
be sufficient cause for the public,
through its authorized agents, to en
ter upon such land and exterminate
such rodents and that all costs of
doing so shall be a lien upon the land,
vhich may be sold to satisfy judgment,
the surplus to go to the owner.
Provision is made for the appoint
ment of gopher and squirrel inspec
tors by Boards of Supervisors upon
petition of twenty-five or more tax
payers. It shall be their duty to in
spect all lands to find out their wealth
us gophers and squirrels and order a
clearance of the rodents. Upon failure
cf the property-owners to obey, the in
spectors or the County Board of Hor
ticulture Commissioners may eradi
cate the pests. It is made mandatory
upon the Horticultural Commissioners
to keep all public roads and highways
cleared of the rodents.
The bill has strong support among
the interior members and the San
Francisco delegation will support it
after making a mild effort to have
sewer rats included. There is going
to be opposition from owners of large
uncultivated tracts, though. It is from
uncultivated land that the rodents run
over to the cultivated. The annual ex
pense of keeping them killed off on
these large tracts will be heavy. Dif
ferent farmers grow different crops,
too, and some do not find it as neces
sary to keep their property as clear
of gophers and squirrels as do those
bordering them. Some, too, are more
careless than the others. The man
who is steeped in an anti-gopher sen
timent is going to force his neighbor
to keen his land undeflled also. With
the bill a law there is a splendid
chance for heartrending instances of
the breaking off of neighborly rela
tions from one end of the State to the
other, and the era of the "gopher
feuds" may form a sad page in Cali
fornia's future history.
SORRY PLIGHT
OF AN EDITOR
Special Dispatch to The Call.
OXNARD, Feb. 19. â Editor Train
of the Oxnard Courier is fighting off
a threatened attack of pneumonia,
which resulted from an enforced bath
during the tremendous rain, storm
here on Thursday night. The news
paper man had occasion to attend a
lodge function. He put on his "other
shirt" for the occasion and sallied
forth between showers. The hour
was late when ha started homeward,
the clouds leaking freely and the night
as black as a coalhole. After leav
ing the main streets of the town, Train
started on a short cut across lots for
home. He finally reached his prem
ises, and was edging around the side
of the house to reach the back door.
The lodge festivities had made him
forgetful and he failed to remember
that he had set a huge hogshead in
the ground to catch the rainwater.
After unlacing his shoes he steered for
the back door. He didn't reach it.
Instead he went splash into the hogs
head. Neighbors, aroused by his
cries, rescued him half dead and he
has not yet recovered from the shock.

tion that cheaper money will soon

CALL* BUREAU. POST BUILDING.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 19.â The Inter
; state Commerce Commission will soon
[be called upon to investigate th*
charges accusing the Santa Fe Rai
way Company of rate discrimination
in favor of the Standard Oil Company
in Kansas. In additional charges filed
; with the Secretary ot Commerce anl
! lÂ«ibor yesterday by Representative
i Campbell, the direct assertion is mad
i ttiat the rate given th* Standard I I
! Company by the Santa Xl- road ha.-,
prevented others from buying or selling
! crude oil or petroleum in the 3t
I Kansas.
The present Secretary of the Navy,
Paul Morton, was vice president ot
; this railroad at the time of the mak-
I ing of the objectionable rate, and as
vice president in charge of traffic mat
ters, he must have known and sanc
tioned the favorable rate granted the
Standard Oil Company. The Preside n:,
is averse to taking Morton to tar
any of his actions while eonr.
v ith the railroad company. He rt
that Morton was devoting his best
forts to securing business for his road,
and feels that any criticism of his ac
tions would be unjust.
The Bureau of Corporations will re

agents of the Bureau of Corpora
have already arrived in Chanute ami

seasion of many letters, telegrams and
other written communications which
will be of benefit to the Government >"
the event of insufficient evidence on

the Standard Oil Company.
Members of the Kansas delegation
charge openly that a system of re 1
existed between the Santa Fe and th-
Standard Oil Company modeled after
that which existed between th^
trust and the Pennsylvania Railroad,
and by reason of which it was enablt-d
to crush all competition In Ohm,
Pennsylvania and Indiana..
Secretary of the Interior Hitchcock,
with whom the charges were filed, will
not discuss the matter.
The Bureau of Corporations has re
ceived offers of assistance from all
sections of the country In the investi

repel!ed many attacks. At last, how
ever, they got me. It was during a
thick fog and in a snow storm that
they managed to explode a torpedo
under the Sevastopol's stern. A big
hole was torn in the hull and the
steering gear rendered useless. The of
ficers' quarters were flooded out, but
the ship, although unmanageable, still
floated. We were short of men, food
and ammunition.
"When it was decided to surrender I
determined that the Japanese would

but enough men to run the engines and,
steering by the propellers, steamed out
until my lead line showed thirty
fathoms of water. There I sank her.
She turned over just before she disap

her now they are welcome to her. The
Petropavlovsk lies in twenty-five
fathoms and they'll never get her
either. All the other ships in the har

United States. The Chinese Govern
ment issued to Mary a passport, just
as big and formidable looking an affair
as ever traveling mandarin carried to
foreign parts. Mary is the youngest
individual to whom such a document
was ever issued.
In spite of the passport, however,
little Mary will not be allowed to land
until Immigration Commissioner
North gives his approval. She has a
Pennsylvania name and an American
guardian, but there is Chinese blood Jn
her veins, and on that account, tiny,
pretty and well vouched for as she is.
Uncle Sam's door is closed in her face
until Commissioner North decides
whether or not little Mary's admission

bear influence on the labor market.

bottom. Captain N. A. Saxe, who com
manded the naval transport Yermack
and who helped to mine Port Arthur
and was also a passenger on the Si
beria, witnessed the destruction of the
flagship from the shore.
The other Russian captain who
came from the Orient on the liner was
E. Schensnovitch, former commander
of the battleship Retvizan. The Retvi
zan was built by the Cramps and Cap
tain Schensnovitch, who superintended
her construction, says that the three
years he spent in Philadelphia made
him a pretty good American.
The Russian ships at Port Arthur,
according to the officers who arrived
{ere yesterday, were undermanned and
hort on ammunition, especially for the
big guns. The damage done to the
ships in the early part of the war was
repaired with great rapidity, they say,
but ships without heavy ammunition
were useless and all idea of venturing
outside and engaging the enemy was
abandoned before the war was very
old. Many of the smaller guns, for
which there was ammunition, were sent
ashore and added to the land de
fenses.
â¢â¢If it had not been for this addition
to the land batteries," says Captain
Saxe, "and for the men sent ashore
from the fleet to aid the land forces.
Port Arthur would have fallen last
August."
The Russians deny the reports that
many vessels succeeded in running the
blockade into Port Arthur. From the
time the blockade was in effect, they
say, until the surrender, only one vessel
got into Port Arthur. That was the
British steamer King Arthur from
Bombay with 60,000 sacks of flour. A

False Checks Issued Until

Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
HONOLULU, February 19.â John P.
Spaulding, assistant postmaster at Ko
loa, Kauai, who has been arrested and
placed under $10,000 bonds, in connec
tion with the huge shortage of $27,356
in the Koloa postoffice funds, is a
young half-white of intelligent appear
ance. Postmaster Rego was arrested
last week.
The method by which the postoffice
was successfully robbed of $27,356, if
not of more than that, was delightfully
simple, and amazingly stupid if inevit
able results are taken into account. It
has been generally assumed that the
operations were successful because a
large business had been done by the
Japanese in remitting money by the
postorlice order system. Thfs, it now
transpires, is not in accord with the
facts. The Koloa office did a big post
office order business, it is true, but
most of it was utterly fictitious. It
was necessary for Postmaster Rego to
make his returns every week, and this
Ihe did. The return sheets, typewritten
!by Spaulding and signed by Rego,
i came forward regularly enough show
i ing certain balances. Checks on Bish-
I op & Co. and on the Bank of Hawaii
j would accompany the statement each
I week, but immediately before the send
! ing irf the statement Rego or Spaulding
j would send to one of the reputable
! firms here bunches of postoffice orders
1 in payment for goods, leaving a large
! balance over, with instructions to have
'â¢ the balance so left over deposited to
the credit of Rego in one of the banks.
Then, when the check sent the postof
fice people here was presented there
! would generally, but not invariably, be
j funds enough to cover it.
To what extent these operations were
carried on may be understood from the
1 fact that on December 3, 1904, no less
I than $10,650 4n fraudulent postoffice or
j ders was sent from Koloa to Honolulu.
Of course the end was bi/und to
I come. The amount of the shortage
' kept growing and growing, and the
I system of covering up could not be
pursued indefinitely. The names of
! both Rego and Spaulding are affixed to
j fraudulent orders now in the hands of
i the Federal authorities. Rego claims
j that the books of his office have not
been examined for two years. He has
made a complete confession to District
I Attorney Breckons.
Two Honolulu men. J. C. Abreu, for
j merly a clerk employed by Rego in his
i store at Koloa, and Guilherme Pereira,
j called also Brilhante. who is a stone
! mason and Rego's brother-in-law, have
I also been arresfed and placed under
! $10,000 bonds. The warrants upon
: which they were taken into custody
I charge them with presenting for pay
â  ment to a disbursing officer of the
' United States money orders that had
i been issued by collusion and fraud.
CADET AT NAVAL ACADEMY
DROPS DEAD IX THE LJXE
Midshipman Samuel Battle of North
Carolina Stricken With Heart
Failure.
ANNAPOLIS, Feb. 19. â Midship
man Samuel Westray Battle of the
second class at the Naval Academy
and a son of Surgeon Samuel W. Bat
tle, U. S. N., retired, of Asheville, N.
C, dropped dead as the brigade of
midshipmen was called to dinner for
mation shortly after 12 o'clock to-day.
Young Battle had just taken his place
as third petty officer of the second bat
trJion when he was stricken with heart
failure. He fell before any one
reached him and was dead when pick
ed up by his mates. He was 21 years
of age.
i few Chinese junks got In, but the sup
! plies they brought did not amount to
i anything.
NO MORE HORSE MEAT.
None of the Russians will ever
' knowingly and willingly partake again â¢
of horse meat. Even horse flesh be- i
came scarce as the siege advanced. â 
: There were not more than enoueh
horses in the town to perform the haul-
Ing for the garrison. When one of 'â 
these overworked steeds, through sick- \
â¢ ness, the enemy's fire or sheer weari- i
I ness, laid down to die, the commissary i
i department was notified and the day
; after choice cuts of meat were served i
I at the officers' mess.
Of the state of affairs ashore the I
â  Russians have little to say. "We were
I busy with our ships. What went on
ashore was the affair of the army." j
| The vessels at Port Arthur when the !
j fortress was surrendered were the bat- i
! tleships Peresviet, Poltava. Retvizan
and Pobieda, cruisers Bayan and Pala
da, mine transport Amur, four destroy-
I ers and half a dozen smaller vessels.
Six destroyers escaped from Port Ar- i
thur on the night of January 1.
The naval officers speak highly of
General Stoessel, but without any par
ticular enthusiasm of anybody. Of
Admiral Wiren, the naval commander
at Port Arthur, they have nothing to
say. They all agree that neither the
army nor the navy at Port Arthur was
j prepared for war with such a foe as the
Jap proved himself. Of the treatment
received at the hands of the Japanese
! after the surrender they make no com
j plaint, except that the sleeping quar
ters provided for them at Dalny were
not so clean as they might have been.
In Japan at present there are about
30,000 Russian prisoners, most of whom
j will be kept in the Island kingdom un
! til the end of the war.
The officers who arrived here yester
i day will proceed to St. Petersburg: with
;as little delay as possible. They are
| glad to be away from the boom of Jap-
I anese guns and other discomforts of
' Port Arthur and are not sorry that
I their word of honor as officers and gen-
I tlemen stands between them, and any
\ further hostile association with the
I pugnacious little brown men.
The Russian officers who came from
i Japan on the Siberia are as follows:
i Captains N. O. yon Essen, E. Schens
! novitch and N. A. Saxe; Lieutenant P.
j P. Ostelezki of Admiral Wiren's staff;

CONTEST NEAR
END IN DENVER
w <
Hearing of Testimony Con
cludes and Briefs and Argu
ments Remain to Be Made
DENVER, Feb. 19.â Hearing of tes
timony in former Governor James H.
Peabody's contest for the office of
Governor closed this evening. Briefs
will be submitted to the contest com
mittee this week by both sides and the
committee is required under the rules
adopted by the General Assembly to
present its report and recommenda
tions on March 1 to Lieutenant Gov
ernor McDonald, president of the joint
committee of the Legislature, by which
the contest will be finally decided. The
joint committee will receive the report
on March 2 and will then determine
how much time shall be allowed for
argument.
Thirty days have been consumed in
hearing evidence in the case and the
expenses of the contest, to be borne by
the State, will amount to more than
$60,000.
On the face of the returns as can
vassed. Governor Adams' majority was
9774. Peabody asked to have the en
tire vote of 104 Denver precincts and
several precincts outside the city
thrown out in consequence of frauds.
Handwriting experts, testifying for
Peabody, claimed to have found 7327
bogus ballots among those in the Den
i ver boxes which they examined. Nine
ty-eight voters have appeared in per
1 son before the contest oommittee and
identified their ballots among those
: classed as bogus by the experts and
i Adams' attorneys ojaim to have proven
about 4DOO such ballots genuine by the
depositions of the persons to whom
i they are credited on the poll books.
Should the contest committee decide,
\ however, to reject the 104 Denver pre
i cincts, Adams' attorneys will endeavor
to have similar action taken as to a
number of precincts in Las Animas
and Huerfano counties, which were
carried by Peabody.
Governor Adams, who expresses him
self as confident of, the result, disap
proves of the demonstration in his
favor at the Capitol on March 2, which
has been proposed by the Building
i Trades Council of this city and in def
erence to his wishes the labor organi
zations may decide to hold mass meet
ings elsewhere instead of assembling
at the Capitol.

Neglected and abandoned, by his

years old, was turned over to the Ju
venile Court authorities by the police.
The child, who was picked up in the
6torm of Friday nig-ht by Patrolman
Feely, has been given temporarily into
the care of Warden James Page at the
Receiving Hospital. The little fellow
(* unusually bright and tells with
much directness the story of his ill

Albert's mother is dead. His father,
Edward P. Henry, has-been living at
1741 Seventh street, but the police have
been unable to find him since the little
waif was found wet to the skin, cold
and half-famished.
At the hospital this afternoon the
boy said his parent spent most of his
time in saloons and had left the child
to shift for himself.
For once in his life the boy was well
provided for. That was to-day, when
he reveled in a Juicy chicken dinner
that the hospital people prepared for
their little guest.
With much enthusiasm and boyish
appetite Albert assimilated the tender
succulent morsels, remarking senten
tiously:
'â¢This Is the be meal I ever ate."
As soon as the absent father can be
located the police purpose to make an
example of him if they substantiate
the boy's charges.

OAKLAND, Feb. 19. â The airship
California Messenger, which was
wrecked in Berkeley yesterday, has
been brought back to Idora. Park,
and is undergoing repairs under
the direction of its inventor, George
E. Heaton. The bamboo frame of the
car was badly shattered and the silk
of the balloon was slightly torn. The
repairs will be completed by Tuesday
and the task of filling the balloon with
gas will be finished by Friday.
While holding the airship close to
the ground yesterday, in order to have
some photographs taken, the knots
slipped suddenly and Mrs. Heaton, who
was on board alone, took an involun
tary trip to Berkeley, where the ship
landed.
The ascent advertised to take place
to-day from Idora Park may take place
next Sunday.

ifornia Messenger. Within the week
it has had two mishaps; the one of
yesterday and also of last Sunday,
when Heaton landed in the bay near
the Key Route pier.
When seen at Idora Park to-day Mr.
Heaton said:
1 was all ready to make a successful trip
to-day, but the unfortunate accident of yes
terday' causes this to be postponed until next
Sunday. We were getting ready to take a
photograph of the Messenger, and for this
purpose had brought the ship within ten yards
of the earth, when the guy rope broke and the
ship, 'with my wife In the car, escaped.
We are now filling the balloon with air to
look for leaks and will be ready for practice
flights by Friday. On next Sunday I hope to
make the most successful trip ever made in
an airship.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 1905
OUTLINE PLANS
FOR CAMPAIGN
Republicans Are Sanguine of
Success for the Entire
Ticket of Their Party
Oakland Office Ran Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Feb. 19.
The plans for the Republican muni
cipal campaign have been outlined by
the city committee of that party.
There will be one big meeting in the
center of the city and an effort will be
made to have one meeting in each
ward, but it is unlikely that the cam
paign will depend entirely upon these
gatherings. As a matter of fact the
members of the committee are inclined
to take the stand that the public
meeting as a political factor is a little
passe. This position is intensified by
the fact that many of the Republican
nominees are also nominees of the
Democratic, Municipal League and
Union. Labor parties, so that some of
the candidates would be talking from
a different party platform every night.
There will be one big Republican
gathering, probably on the evening of
March 10, which would be the Friday
evening before the municipal election.
This meeting will probably be ad
dressed by Sam Shortridge or by Con
gressman D. E. McKinlay or Senator
Frank P. Flint if they are in San Fran
cisco.
There is a growing sentiment In
Oakland for a straight Republican
ticket and a completely harmonious
administration that will support Mayor
Frank K. Mott in all of his efforts for
the city of Oakland. This sentiment
is in complete accord with the wishes
and desires of the Republican City
Committee and they feel that with a
few well directed efforts they will
be able to produce a complete Repub
lican victory at the coming election.
The Republicans have set two posi
tive dates, both of them on Washing
ton's birthday. In the First Ward at
Pezzola's Hall there will be a series
of addresses by the candidates of the
Republican party, and on the same
evening there will be a meeting at
Alcatraz Hall on Peralta street in the
Fourth Ward. Other announcements
will be made later.
John L. Davie to-day filed his peti
tion as an independent candidate for
Mayor. The petition carried 795 names
and will entitle Mr. Davie to a place
upon the ticket.
A story has been in circulation that
George E. Randolph, the Union Labor
candidate for Mayor, would withdraw
from that nomination and that John
L. Davie would replace him. Mr. Ran
dolph said to-day that he would re
main upon the Union Labor ticket and
Mr. Davie Baid tha*t he would only
seek election as an independent and
would not try for any party nomina
tion.
During the week L. N. Cobbledlck
has resigned from the Municipal
League ticket as Councilman-at-Large.
The Union Labor party held its first
meeting of the campaign last even
ing. The audience was addressed by
various nominees on the party ticket.
The Portuguese Republican Club has
been organized with the following of
flcere: President, J. T. Renas; vice
president, J. M. Alves; secretary, J.
Valladao.
Most of us expect better obituary
notices than are coming to us.
GIVES BATTLE
FOR HIS LIFE
Patrolman Fahy Victor in a
Desperate Encounter With
Drink-Maddened Prisoner
FIGHTS TO GET PISTOL
Former Yardmaster Tries to
Kill Bluecoat After He
Has Been Put Under Arrest
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Feb. 19.
With a loaded pistol pressed against
his body, Patrolman John T. Fahy
fought for his life this morning at
West Oakland against Lindsay S.
Hackett, formerly a Southern Pacific
Company yardmaster, who snapped the
weapon several times In his attempt
to kill the oolicenian. Hackett was
prevented from committing murder by
merest chance. Fahy managed to jam
his hand under the revolver hammer
and check the discharge of the cart
ridges. In the battle that ensued for
possession of the pistol, Hackett was
beaten into submission and was sent
to the Receiving Hospital.
There a scalp wound and several
ruts and bruises about his head were
treated. Afterward the belligerent
railroad man was sent to the City
Prison, where charges of drunkenness
and assault with a deadly weapon
were registered against him.
The encounter occurred at Seventh
and Chester streets at 3:30 o'clock this
morning. An hour before the battle
Fahy found Hackett asleep in front
of a store near there. The policeman
escorted the man to his home, 865
Chester street, around the comer, and
departed on his rounds. Shortly after
3 o'clock the lusty blowing of a po
lice whistle attracted the patrolman,
who ran to Seventh and CJiester
streets, only to see Hackett in front
of a restaurant, abusive and intoxicat
ed. Fahy placed the man under ar
rest. Hackett, with an oath, sudden
ly drew the pistol from his pocket,
jammed the muzzle against Fahv and
pulled the trigger. The policeman was
quick enough to force his hand be
tween the hammer and the chamber.
The metal point tore into Fahy's hand
and inflicted a painful wound.
Then followed a desperate fight for
the revolver. The men are powerful
and Hackett was inflamed by strong
drink. Back and forth across the side
walk they struggled until the bluecoat
managed to get his club into action.
With one hand Fahy kept a firm grip
on the pistol, while the other one
worked quickly and effectively the
baton on Hacketfs head. In a few
minutes the railroader was ready to
cry "quits."

SOONER THAN EXPECTED
Liner Brings Many Passengers
and Very Valuable Cargo.
TRANSPORT DIX IS IN FROM MANILA
The Pacific Maii Company's liner
Siberia, Captain J. Tremalne Smith,
arrived yesierday from the Orient two
days ahead of her schedule and sev
eral hours before Bhe was exuected.
She left Honolulu at 4 p. m. February
13 and was not looked for here until
l&te yesterday afternoon. Bright and
early in the morning, however, she
loomed up through the smother of the
southerly gale which was romoinK
along the coast and soon after sunrise
was In quarantine, waiting for the Fed
â¢ral doctors.
The big liner had great difficulty get
ting alongside the Pacific Mall wharf.
The tide was ebbing and the strong
southerly wind did ail It could to blow
her away from her berth. Persever
ance, the tug Arabs and some stout
hawsers, with the assistance of the
Siberia's own twin screws, finally over
came the resistance of wind and tide
and down a steep gangway the liner's
passengers were soon clambering.
The Siberia was In fine weather all
the way across the Pacific and came
into port looking as clean and trim as
when she went away. She brought
Â«i 46 tons of freight, which Included 725
bales of raw silk. She brought 416 pas
eengers, of whom* about 300 were
Asiatics.
Among the passengers was Louts
Eppinger, one of the best known hotel
men in the Orient. Dr. Gates, sur
geon; George E. Chap in, purser: Alex
ander Morphy, freight clerk, and W. G.
Thompson, chief steward of the liner
Gaelic, returned on the Siberia. They
left the Gaelic at Hongkong, where she
Is waiting for somebody to buy her or
for orders to return to England. Dr.
Gates, who is the senior sure-eon of
the line, will to-day Join the liner Cop
tic. Following Is a list of the, Siberia's

B'NAI B'RITH
MEMBERS MEET
Delegates From All Parts
of Coast Attend Annual
Convention of the Order
IMPORTANT MOVES MADE
Portland Men Would Abolish
Secrecy, but the Motion
Is Unanimously Defeated
The annual convention of the Grand
Lodge of B'nai B'rith opened at the
hall of the order on Eddy street yes
terday morning. Delegates to the
number of more than 250 from all over
the Pacific Coast and Arizona were
present. Much important business was
transacted and several heated discus
sions arose during the progress of the
meeting.
The gathering was called to order by-
Grand President M. H. Wascherwitz,
after which twenty-five past presidents
were initiated. The grand president
and grand secretaries delivered their
annual reports, which were ratified by
the executive committee. The society
has gained nearly 300 members during
the last year and is stronger financially
than ever before.
The delegation from Portland was In
favor of renouncing the secrecy con
nected with the order and was pre
pared to make a fight to carry the
point. The matter was taken up and
resulted In a long discussion. Several
speeches were made and the motion
was finally defeated unanimously,
after an eloquent address by Dr. Voor
sanger.
Several important amendments were
adopted and turned over to the com
mittee on legislation for ratification.
It is likely that some changes will be
made In the by-laws of the order.
They are under discussion by the com
mittees.
It was decided byea unanimous vote
to take "no further action in regard to
the property on Van Ness avenue
owned by the order. At the meeting
last year a committee was appointed
to investigate the details. This body
reported in favor of selling the prop
erty and Investing the money in some
other portion of the city. The mem
bers last night voted in favor of grant-
Ing this committee another year's
grace in which to complete the trans
action.
This Question was also a much-de
bated one. There were several prom
inent members who took opposite
stands on the issue and nearly the
entire evening session was taken up
in discussing the project. Many
speeches were made and various opin
ions offered. A liberal donation was
made to the Hebrew Orphan Asylum
of this city. It was decided to estab
lish libraries of the order in Portland
and Los Angeles.
The session will be resumed this
morning at 10 o'clock. There is much
business of importance before the ex
ecutive body and it will probably take
several days to complete the details.
The election will take place on Tues
day afternoon at 2 o'clock. At that
time eight delegates will also be chos
en to represent the Pacific Coast body
at the national convention soon to be
held at New Orleans.

NINE THOUSAND
DOLLARS GIVEN
California-Street Methodist
Episcopal Church Members
More Than Lift Debt
WORSHIPERS REJOICE
Bishop Hamilton Extends
Praise to Parishioner for
His Indefatigable Work
The large sum of $9033 was raised
at the California-street Methodist
Episcopal Church yesterday morning
and evening with which to raise the
debt of the splendid structure.
But $8500 was required, yet so en
thusiastic was the congregation that
Bishop John W. Hamilton, who
preached the sermon at both morning
and evenins services, was readily ten
dered the subscriptions over the needed
sum.
The rejoicing was so great in the
church last night when the handsome
total was announced that the whole
congregation, which numbered many
soldiers from the Presidio, some of
whom, too, were among the generous
subscribers, sang hymns / of thankful
ness, and the choir followed with the
grand anthem "From Egypt's Bond
age."
Bishop Hamilton expressed his great
happiness at the result and Dr. W. S.
Matthew, presiding elder, was highly
elated and so expressed himself. The
Bishop paid the Rev. George A. Hough,
the new pastor of the church, a great
compliment for the life he had brought
to it. It was only a few months since
that Mr. Hough came to San Francisco
from Los Angeles and since that time
he has worked indefatigably to gain
the results of yesterday, said the
Bishop. Another thing that pleased
Bishop Hamilton was the determina
tion of 100 young men at a banquet in
the church hall last Friday night to
aid In raising the debt.
Following members of the official
board were diligent workers for the
cause:
J. W. Wetmore, George Scovel, M. B. Scho
fleld, Mrs. E. Lewis, 11. W. Lewis, H. E. Bea
eett, Mies Myrtle Baker, B. F. Magrgart. Rev.

BODY OF MAX DISCOVERED
FLOATING IN THE BAY
From Papers in Clothing It Is Sup
posed to Be That of Joseph
Hobl, Jamestown.
The body of a man was found float
ing in the bay at the Lombard-street
slip yesterday afternoon by John Wil
son, who notified the Morgue. Dep
uty Coroner Fennell took charge of
the body, which, he thought, had been
in the water for about two weeks.
The body Is supposed to be that of
Joseph Hobi. In the pockets of the
clothing were found two checks, each
for $22 60, signed by the secretary of
the Twenty-eight Oil Company of
Fresno in payment of dividends on 150
shares of stock. One was dated Jan
uary 16 and the other February 1.
Each was made payable to Joseph
Hobi and an envelope was addressed
to Joseph Hobi, Jamestown, Cal.
A note was also found addressed to
Joseph McDonnell, Sunset Supply Com
pany, Sunset, Cal., bearing date of No
vember 23, 1903, and signed R. L.
Cheney, which read: "Try and get Mr.
Hobi some work." There was no
money In the purse found in the
pockets.
TELLS THE POLICE THAT
THREE MEN ROBBED HIM
Louis M. Frank Is Found Lyine on
Sidewalk at Grant and Union
Squnre Avenues.
Louis M. Frank, who lives at 1353
Post street, was found lying on the
sidewalk at Union Square and Grant
avenues shortly after 1 o'clock Sun-
day morning by Sergeant Coogan and
Patrolman Connors. The man was
apparently dazed when the officers
found him. k
Frank told the policeman that Tie
had been held up and robbed by three
men. He said they took a diamond
ring from h!m. which he valued at
$2FO, and they also took several dol
lars from his pockets. One of the
men. he said, struck him on the head
with a club, rendering him uncon
scious, and he did not remember what
happened then until the policemen
found him. The matter was reported
at police headquarters, and Detectives
Wren and Dinan were detailed to In
vestigate the matter.
"Plum Pudding Tommy" Dying.
Thomas Brennan, better known
among the sporting element as "Plum
Pudding Tommy" or "English Tom
my," was taken to the Central

noon as a result of a prolonged spree.
Hemorrhage of the lungs ensued, and
at an early hour this morning he was
reported to be dying. He lived at
114 Ellis street.

STREET FIGHT IX MISSIOX
ENDS IN CUTTING SCRAPE
Adolf Aasnes, a Carpenter, Is Arrested
on a Charge of Assault to
Commit Murder.
Adolf Aadnes, a carpenter, living at
106 Eureka street, was arrested yester
day afternon by Policeman T. J. Con
nell and booked at the City Prison on
a charge of assault to murder. The
complaining witness against him is
Michael Whalen, who had a cut on
his face attended to at the Central
Emergency Hospital.
Aasnes and two friends, O. B. Olson
and S. Svarnas, who also live on Eu
reka street, were going home about 2
o'clock yesterday morning and as they
turned into Eureka street, from
Eighteenth, six young men began to
use insulting language toward them
and to throw rocks at them. A fight
followed and Aasnes was knocked
down and kicked. There were cries
of "Shoot him!" and it is alleged that
Whalen, who was on top of Aasnes,
put his hand in his hip pocket, when
Aasnes opened his pocket knife and
cut Whalen on the face with it.
Policeman Connell says that Whalen
and his gang do not bear a good char
acter in the neighborhod and that
Aaesnes and his two friends are re
spectable workingmen.

"Bloclf' Light
The "Block" is really a marvelous light â the brightest,
the simplest and most e,asily managed of any. It burns eight
parts of air to one of gas, thereby reducing your gas bills
one-half and giving at the same time over four times the light
you get from any other burner. Every "Block light" is guaran-
teed to produce, with a single mantle, a light equal to Three
Hundred Candle-Power, exceeding in brilliancy any other light
on the market. It makes reading, writing or any other occu-
pation of the evening a pleasure and saves the eyes as well.
The vital principle of the Block Light lies in the com-
mingling of gas and air, producing perfect combustion. Its
construction is simple. There Is a check which regulates the
flow of gas, and an air chamber of an accurately gauged ca-
pacity. The gas passes through a patented gauze, is broken
into particles, which mix with air. The degree of brilliancy of
the light depends upon the perfection of this mixture. An air
shutter regulates the flow of gas to the burner.

CLEVERLY DUPED
Angelus Hotel Is Out $800
as Result of Graciousness
to Two Supposed Guests
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES Feb. 10.â Within
plain sight of scores of guests and al
most within arm's reach of two clerks,
two professional thieves looted the of
fice safe in the Angelus Hotel to-night,
secured $800 and made their escape.
The men were well dressed and to
the telephone operator behind the
counter they posed as guests of the
house. The hotel telephone exchange
is in a small enclosure near the main
office, just inside the door of which
stands the safe. Engaging the tele
phone girl in conversation, they asked
permission to examine the switch
board. She admitted them behind her
railing. One of them called her at
tention to another telephone and asked
her to show him how by operating
that telephone the signal was given
upon the switchboard. She complied
and went to the other end of the coun
ter and showed the agreeable fellow
all the workings of the various tele
phones.
She was gone perhaps two minutes,
but in that time the other thief
stepped into the office and secured a
roll of bills which was lying in plain
sight in the safe. The two thieves
then thanked the girl and departed.
Ten minutes later the theft was dis
covered.

BUSINESS STILL ON A STABLE BASIS.
TRAD]-: was featureless all over the country last week, if we ex
cept the cold and stormy weather, in some respects the worst
of the winter, as far as the greater part of the country was con
cerned. Snow and low temperatures over two-thirds of the Lnited
States chocked transportation and kept people within doors, and thus
operated against general distributive trade. Nevertheless, the bank
clearings showed the marked increase of 32.4 per cent over the cor
responding week of IQO4. and only rive cities out of the first seventeen
in The list exhibited a loss, the largest being 30.1 per cent, at New Or
leans.
Renewed activity on the New York Stock Exchange ran the
clearings of the metropolis up to a gain of 50.2 per cent, and Pitts
burg, whose clearings are considered an index to the condition of the
iron ana steel trades, was a close second, with a gain of 47.1 per
cent. But the aggregate clearings themselves fell off to $2,296,234,
000, which is below recent aggregates, and indicates a decline in
general business, for which the bad weather is doubtless more or less
:isiblc. Philadelphia showed a gain of 27.4 per cent, which looks
well for the textile industries," though it is noteworthy that most jf
the Gulf cities, which are affected by the condition of the cotton mar
ket, shows a loss from last year. Chicago, the center of the grain and
provision trades, and Bo6ton, the distributing point of the footwear
and leather industries, show gains of 10.0. and 12.3 per cent respec
thely. The failures for the. week were 258. against 287 last year.
The show ing for the week, as far as these figures go, is excellent,
and had it not been for the repressing effects of the bad weather
would probably have been even better. The statistical position of
business, therefore, is very satisfactory. If the great producing and
distributing centers of the country show gains in the volume of com
merce over a year ago it is reasonable to infer that business through
out the whole country is larger than at the corresponding time in the
preceding year.
A very good sign of the times is that the talk about trust, traffic
and tariff legislation, which the Wall street bears are industriously
vising as a handle to depress the stock market, is really producing
very little adverse effect, either on stocks or business. Xor has the
export oi $70,000,000 of gold to foreign countries during the past
five months caused any disturbance in financial quarters. This point
is valuable, as showing the inherent soundness and stability of trade.
"Were conditions strained or unsound this legislative talk and these
gold exports would l\ave caused more or less demoralization. The
great factor in the maintenance of buoyancy and confidence is the
knowledge that the supply of money in the country is vast. Every
financier and merchant who keeps at all posted knows that we have
plenty of money to meet any contingency which is likely to con
front us. and there is nothing like a large bank account in the maii>
tenance of credit.
The condition of the great staples, upon which the country's
trade also so largely depends, continues satisfactory. While there
abnormal activity in any particular line, the whole group is
prog- smoothly. A squeeze in wheat at Chicago has runlet)
parfcet during the past few days, but that is a local and specu
lative condition and therefore transitory. Cotton is gradually point
ing upward, with the Southern planters indisposed to let go of their
holdings as a rule. Tf they were poor and in need of money they
would be throwing their goods on the market. This is another good
sign. Hides stand about the same and the leather trade is reported
>d condition. The Eastern dry goods trade reports an excellent
demand i n fabrics for export to China and other foreign
countries. The woolen trade is also in very fair condition, though
some ease in the market for foreign wools is repotted. Iron and
steel show continued activity, and the mills are still sending in cheer
ful reports, many of them having their books full of orders, sufficient
to keep them running several months without any new business.
The crop outlook, both on the Pacific Coast and in the Western
wheat belt, continues excellent. In fact, a close scrutiny of the finan
cial, commercial, industrial and agricultural interests of the country
fails to reveal any adverse conditions to produce apprehension as to
the future, and it is reasonable to presume that with the exercise of
ordinary conservatism the present stable business status will con
tinue indefinitely.
ST. LOUIS COMMISSIONERS' REPORT.
WITH the filing on Tuesday in the office of Governor Pardee
of the final report of the California Commissioners to the
Louisiana Purchase Exposition there should come to the citi
zens of this State a sense of gratification upon the satisfactory com
pletion of so noteworthy an undertaking, and also a sense of happi
n the realization that the right men were chosen for the trust
imposed in them.
The opportunity given this State to show its splendid possibili
ties, through the medium of the St. Louis Exposition, cannot but re
sult in material benefit. California exhibitors were there enabled to
show their wares and products to millions of people, who came from
the four corners of the earth, and the receipt of seven hundred awards
attest? the merit of their display. An uncommon feature lav in the
great diversity of the exhibits. They came from more different sec
tions of the State than ever before, and in consequence there was not
only more variety, but the benefit of the advertising will be more
evenly distributed.
The financial showing made by the Commissioners in returning
t" the State treasury over six thousand dollars in cas'i and credits,
still having <>n band a twelve-thousand dollar exhibit for the Lewis
and Clark Exposition, is very commendable. The people of Califor
nia should not forget that the success of the display was largely due
to the business sagacity and experience in exposition work of the
Commissioners, who may rest from their labors confident of having
merited the thanks of the people they represented, and with a sense
of a work well done.
THE MURDER OF SERGIUS.
THE ? c vaÂ«sination of the Czar's uncle is another Russian horror
pttributabie to the repressions of an autocratic government
When hundreds of people were shot down and sabered by the
â¢ h;le on their way, unarmed, to peacefully petition the
;â¢-:-.; â¢-:-. it was sure that there w6uld be reprisals that would touch the
circle of Grand Dukes.
It is a savage picture, thai of the Military Governor of Moscow
blown asunder and staining with his blood the snow within the walls
of the Kremlin. But it was also a savage picture thai Sunday when
the people knelt in the mow in St. Petersburg and wailed their
dead, shot down by the soldiers of the Czar. These make the somber
background of that system which holds Russia as the personal prop
erty of the Grand Dttkvs. with the life of every man and woman held
at the will of the Czar. It throws into high relief the position of
Japan, fighting to prevent the extension of that kind of government
over Eastern \sia.
The world has made up its mind that such government should
not be extended over more territory and more people, for wherever
it goes will be reproduced the massacre of St. Petersburg and the
tansi nation in the Kremlin. This will be as surely as effect follows
cause. Japan is making the fight for better government, and all the
influences of liberty and humanity inspire her armies.

THIRTEEN young women have
been found in Brooklyn wh->
dare to defy superstition. For
two years twelve women who had
pledged themselves as members
searched for a last nnd thirteenth. She
was found recently in the GrcenDoint
school, where she is a teacher.
A few iays later the XIII Ciub was
organized at the home of Mrs. Alic:
O'Hara of 336 Jay street. Thirteen
by-laws were passed upon, the nature
of which is secret.
The next thirteen minutes were given
over to the serving of refreshments.
Mirrors were given as favors, and as
each guest left the room she was com

a prize.

SPOILING A STORY.
A lady newly arrived in Washing
ton was at a dinner a few nights ago
and amazed everybody by telling the
brand and vintage of a rare wine
without seeing the bottle.
"Hdw can you do It?" she was
asked.
"Oh," she replied, "I was born in
New Orleans, you know, and was
raised there. When I was a slip of a
girl my father used to take me down
into his great wine cellar under the
house and show me all about wines
down in those gloomy caves.
After the dinner the hostess said to
her husband: "Wasn't it interesting to
hear Mrs. So-and-Ho tell about her
father's wine cellars?"
"Great!" repeated the brutal hus
band. "Absolutely great! It was
simply fine. You know, there isn't a
cellar in New Orleans."â New York

THE IDEAL WOMAN.
"An ideal woman, according to a
[ member of her sex who has devoted
j considerable time to studying the
! characteristics of her sister?, is not
I only easy to live with, but worth liv
j ing for," says a writer. "She wears
! a reasonable hat at matinees. She is

I not insist upon her husband eating up
I the cucumber sandwiches left over
from one of her parties; she eats them
herself, and suffers in silence.
"She is not such a fool as to fancy
that any one is ever convinced by ar

t loving many. She knows that every
j real woman is the ideal woman, the
i fact being that every ideal of the ideal

FINDS NEW USE
FOR POSTAGE
STAMPS.
"I've found a new Ã¼Ãe for my postage
stamps," said a Harlem pater-familias
the other day. "I was left at home to
take care of our ten-month-old boy
while nay wife was out bargain hunt
ing. It was my plan to put the little
fellow to sleep, then get at the pile of
unanswered letters on my desk. My
plans miscarriedâ for a while. The lit
tle chap persisted in staying awake and
clamoring for my attention. I devised
many forms of amusement for him.
but none lasted long enough for me to
get really to work.
"In looking about for something
which shouTd insure me more than a
breathing spell I caught sight of a
bright, new two-cent postage stamp.
I thought of the little fellow's love for
colorâ took the stamp and pasted it
securely on the palm of his hand. It
was a grand success. He played with
that newly decorated hand for an hour
âthen relief came in the return of his

ONE OF THE OLD GUARD
When the Empress Eugenic arrived
on Tuesday night from the Hotel Con
tinental and stepped from the electric
coupe which had been sent to the sta
tion to meet her, a tall and soldierly
old man of some seventy years stood
with bared head and saluted in mili
tary' fashion, says the Paris corre
spondent of the London Express.
In the brilliant days of the second
empire the old soldier formed part of
the Empress' bodyguard, and it is said
that he conceived a strong platunic love
Â£01 his sovereign, which made him the
butt of his comrades.
The Empress frequently visits the
city over which she once reigned so
brilliantly, but even the newspapers |
hardly notice her comings and goings.
The old soldier, however, never fails ,
in his fidelity, and stands in one of the
corridors through which the Empress
is bound to pass, so that he may salute j
his former sovereign as she passes at ;
the Hotel Continental. He lnvdtiably j
brings a magnificent bouquet of violets I
or roses, which are placed in the Em
press' drawing room.
TEETHANuitwirERAMENT
"I don't suppose many people stop to
think that the formation of their teeth
is an indication of their temperament,"
said a dentist the other day.
"Did you ever see a person with long,
narrow teeth wh,o had not a very n^r
vi us, highstrung temperament? Did
you ever see a person with short, broad
ttelh who was not somewhat phleg
matic and cheerful? I often wonder
when the pretty girl opens her mouth
to show her ivory white teeth if she
realizes that some of us are sizing up
her disposition.
"I unconsciously fall into the habit
Of looking at the teeth of the people I
meat socially and choosing my acquain
tances accordingly. That is one of the
reasons why false teeth ought to be
mode exactly like th? original set.
They have to fit the temperament of
thi wearer." â Philadelphia Record.
DADDY'o LARLING.
She comes to me when I'm at work
And rumples up my hair;
She plays among the papers which
I've just arranged with care;
She chatters, too. yet. all the same.
I love to have her there.
Shi' spoils my pens, upsets the ink,
And makes a dreadful noise;
The table that I write upon
Is covered with her toys;
Yet. all thfÂ» same, she is to me
The greatest of my joys.
She shows me all her dollies, too,
And when she tumbles down,
'Tis I who always comfort her
And kiss away the frown;
Yet. all the same, she is to me
A queen without a crown.
'Tis sweet to hear her baby voice.
That calls me by my name;
She's such a little darling, how
Can anybody blame?
She is a teasing pet, but. still.
I love her all the same.

Anyway, she was trying to keep up

ever the motive behind the deed, or
however great the resentment, what is
known as "a scene" is a mistake which
reflects discredit upon the person who
is directly responsible for it.
If engaged or married people want
to quarrel, let them do so behind closed
doors. A curtain lecture may help
even an unwilling audience if the lec
turer is qualified for the position, but
to x air private grievances in public is
an error of judgment as well as a so
cial blunder.
This is" a fact which it is well for
girls to bear in mind, for too often,
out of sheer caprice or thoughtlessness,
they humiliate unnecessarily those
whom they love.
There is never any excuse for "mak
ing an example" of the man whom
you have promised to marry. "When
you hold him up to criticism you are
making' a target of yourself.
If your fiance does something that
you do not like when you are out
somewhere with him, let It pass until
you two are alone together. An ex
hibition of bad temper or of offended
pride will' not help matters any, but
will only furnish a handle for gossip.
"Whether your feelings are hurt or not,
you must consider his dignity, for if

It Is not stern correction that most

Rarely Is it woman's part to be Just.

THE LOCK SYSTEM â H. S. H.. De
coto, Cal. The lock system on canals
is an arrangement that consists of two
pairs of gates, opening upon the
stream, and offering when shut a
salient angle to the stream or upper
pressure. The effect Is that the weight
above only ten.is to close the gates still
tighter. When a vessel is to be
brought from one level to the other
it is floated into the "pound." as the
space between the upper and lower
gates is called. The gates are then
shut and a sluice In the lower part of
the upper gate raises the surface of
the "pound." or the sluice in the lower
gate depresses it in a few minutes to
the level of the upper or lower reach,
as the case may be. These sluicea are
â¢worked by racks in the gates and th
ponderous gates themselves are moved
with the aid of long and heavy levers.
One pair of gates must always bÂ« shut,
or the two reaches would speedily as
simlate their levels. The system is ex
tensively used in Holland, in Italy and
in the United States as well as in Eng
land.HOME FESTIVITIES FILL

Faith. The society was organized by
Miss Eliza O'Brien Lummis to fight di

visited Rome, and gaining an audience
with the Holy Father, asked him for
official approval of the society. The
Pope grave her a papal brief, conced

the brief, which has Just been made
public, follows, In part:
To our beloved daughter in Christ, Eliza
O'Brien Lummis, moderator of the Society of
Filiae Fidel: Health and apostolic blessing.
It is with a reeling of sweet consolation
that we have learned what you have made
known to us concerning the society which
you have founded, its organization and its
excellent results.
â¢Airing the duties we mention particularly
that protecting the Christian marriage against
tlit? disgraceful stain of divorce; of providing
for proper education within the domestic walls
as well as In the schools; of checking: those
pests of human society â namely: The shamf-
Icss iicenss of spectacular representations, of
Immoral books, of idle, wanton conversation
at gatherings, and of shameful extravaguni*.

the work you have Inaugurated, not without
divine inspimtmn and guidance, which you
have prosT-iuted with the approbation of the
head of your diocese â that work \vÂ» wish you
to continue lunceforth with greater ardor,
while relying on the support of our authority.
As aii augury of the assurance of divine
Mewing and a token of our paternal benev

DINNER TO CELEBRATES
CLUB ANNIVERSARY
Veterans In Bohemia to Be Guests
of Raphael WelU To-Mor
row Night,
The annual dinner of the founders
of the Bohemian Club will take place
at Marchand's Tuesday evening, Feb
ruary 21. On this occasion the vet
erans of Bohemia will be the guests
of Raphael Weill. There are indica
tions that the attendance will be large,
embracing several old-timers, who
have not for some years attended the
annual function in the red room of
the club. Joseph H. N. Irwin, who is
a charter member of the club, has sig
nified acceptance of Mr. Weill's invita
tion. Edward Bosqui, who was one
of the most popular and progressive
members when the club had its home
on Sacramento street, advises Mr.
Weill that he will be "present next
Tuesday evening.
On February 15, 1872, a number of
journalists and other writers met and
resolved to establish ft club. The con
stitution was adopted March 4, 1872.
On March 9 twenty names of charter
members were subscribed to the con
stitution. The club was formally or
ganized April 1, 1872, and incorpor
ated May 17. The first president of
the club was Thomas Newcomb, then
city editor of The Call. He left San
Francisco in 1876 and has resided ever
since in Albany, N. Y.
Colonel Alex G. Hawes and Edward
Bosqui, who served on the first board
of directors, 1872-73, reside in Cali

John Connctt Makes Several Tests
AVith Apparatus on Merchants'
Exchange Structure.
The new life line, which is invented
to be shot to the tops of buildings in
case of fire, was given a trial on the
hiph Merchants' IGxchange building
yesterday morning. The apparatus
did not work as well as its inventor,
John Connett, expected. The line
reached no farther than the twelfth
story in its best test, but a strong wind
â was blowing at the time and inter
fered with the experiment.
The test attracted a crowd. Among
those present were Chief Engineer
Sullivan of the Fire Department and
several of the battalion chiefs and
other officials. Connett tried several
times to shoot the line over the top
of the building, but the cannon was
not possessed of sufficient force to turn
the trick. The inventor is not yet
satisfied with his experiment and says
he will give the machine another trial
soon and feels confident that his next
efforts will meet v/ith success.

SUFFRAGISTS BRAVE
UNDER LATE DEFEAT
BETTER LUCK TWO YEARS HENCE
Senators Who Declaimed About "Women's
Sphere" on List of Doomed.
LAURA BRIDE POWERS
Alas! Alas! That California must
keep on going to smash for another
two yeaijs.
And all because Senator Sanford and
Senator Wolfe and a few other mental
relics of ye olden day got up in meet
in' and declared that "women's spere"
was inside the house â not out; that
the male population was quite capable
of handling the ballots without the as
sistance of women, and that women
wouldn't know how to vote if they
were enfranchised.
Unhappy Senators Sanford and
Wolfe, where have you been these
last many years, that women have
been accomplishing so many intel
ligent things? Likewise many things
wherein self-interest was not a fac
tor. You are mistaken about wo
men not knowing how to voteâ you
surely are. That intricate art has been
acquired in the clubs, good friends.
Are you gentlemen aware that the
Australian ballot system is in vogue
in many clubs? And if it is the per
sonnel of the vote you are grouchy
about, why, my dear fellows, it is not
of record that men always vote right.
Recent developments In your own
little set look somewhat to the con
trary.
Come now, be honest. You will ad
mit, if you're big-minded enough to
admit the truth, that it's not the spirit
of a free nation to exclude intelligent
native-born citizens from the right to
participate in the government or that j
nation, simply because, by decree of j
nature, a portion of its citizens hap
pens to be born females.
True, there are a lot of fool females
â even as are there a lot of fool males.
Recent history proves that. Therefore
the right to vote â to say what shall or
shall not beâ should not be governed
by sex, but by intelligence and respon
sibility.
This separation of rights and duties
according to sex is a heritage from the
days when women were the ( toys of
men. the mediums whereby to perpet
uate the race; when they were thought
to possess no souls; when they were
"unclean things," unfit to enter the
temples to worship. But Christianity
wrought the change. Women gradually
became man's companionâ not only his
physical mate, but his mental and
moral comrade. And while tha growth
has been slow, owing to the lack of
opportunity, though the lack of educa
tion and the broadening influence of
responsibility, women are growing.
We are not such foola as we look!
And if legislators are not big enough
to recognize in the women of to-day at
least as much intelligence as in the
V>ulk of the foreigners who vote, then
they prove the statement that men
make some mighty queer choices for
the Legislature. Women couldn't do
worse, silly Â«s they are.
This antediluvian talk about sex in
matters relating to personal worth as
manifested in ability, integrity or gen
eral fitness is absurd.
The whole subject centers on per
sonal worth, NOT upon sex, and the
day is not far when even legislators
(even those not picked for their per
spicacity) will see the absurdity of
putting up a barrier of sex against the
right of American-born citizens to
have a voice in the government, to
the support of which she pays an equal
share of the tax.
To be sure, it takes sortie-men a long
time to change the style of their hat,
the cut of their coat, the shape of their
$le, but it takes infinitely longer to
change the cut of their ideas. Inas
much as their grandmothers had no
voice in the government, nor their
sainted mothers, why should their
wives or sisters or sweethearts desire
it? And herein is the logic of right
and justice lost sight ofâ logic, that
boasted possession of man. Person
ality again, as opposed to sex.
The veto of the constitutional
amendment eliminating "female" from
the constitution happened upon the
auspicious day of St. Valentine. And
some clever coterie of wags â could it
have been the suffragists?â sent ap
propriate valentines to each opposing
Senator. They were mighty funny,
some of them, these pen-and-ink
sketches.
But after all is said and aone, equal
rights will come some day, with the
gradual dawning of Justice upon *he
general masculine mind. And not un
til men outgrow the idea of natural
mental and moral supremacy will the
change come. And they do hate so to
share honors! t
But it will come, in its own good
time, as a natural result of education,
Senators Wolfe, Sanford, Curtin and
the rest of the fellows who said nay
notwithstanding. Meanwhile let the
suffrage clubs get busy.
No! I wouldn't advise assassination.
Russia seems to have a monopoly of
that. But I would suggest, if the suf
frage^ clubs are in earnest about secur
ing suffrage for California, that they
quietly assert their activities before
the next primaries. And California
must keep on a-going to smash for two
years more!
Meanwhile, why not set out to ob
tain an educational and property qual
ification for enfranchisement? If in
telligent women, manjr of whom are
large taxpayers, cannot have a voice
in the government, why should illiter
ate and indigent foreigners? Will the
gentlemen at Sacramento who glibly
discoursed upon "woman's sphere" ex
plain?

Frank and Malcolm Johnson and
Misses Amelia Bliss and Anna Wood.
They 'gave the history of the "'Trojan

Last Thursday the Jewish Council of
Women, Mrs. Louis Hertz president,
held an interesting session. Miss Kate

of the afternoon.
The California Club will have a busy
day to-morrow, as the much-discussed
amendments will come up for disposi
tion. The amendment providing for
the Australian ballot system seems to
be in a fair way of winning. The pro
vision making admission to the club
more of a ceremony will probably pass,
as the club is already quite large
enough. All the provisions herein con
tained are eminently sane and logical.
The Clionian Club, whose meeting
day fell upon Tuesday, February 14,
held a merry vigil with the patron
saint of hearts. Mrs. J. H. Robertson
caused the members to bring original
valentines, each of which was read by
other than the "poet" â with very funny
effect. Chatter over the tea cups
about the clever "hits" continued till
the shadows began to fall.
This afternoon the Women's Press
Association will give an informal re
ception to Mrs. Gertrude Atherton at
Century Hall â a pretty compliment to
the association, since the gifted writer
abjures public entertaining.
The Outdoor Art League recently re
ceived a letter from the committee of
residents of the Oceanside District,
asking co-operation in protesting to
the Board of Police Commissioners
against the issuance of licenses for
liquor saloons in that neighborhood.
The various women's clubs throughout
the city were notified by the league
and asked to unite in support of this
protest.
At the meeting of the Commissioners
on February 15 a number of club wom
en were in attendance and several
Â«poke in behalf of the residents near
the beach. It was stated that hereafter
the residents of Oceanside would be
notified as to applications for licenses
for saloons in that locality.
The leaf, c is in receipt of an invita
tion from Mrs. Charles F. MHspaugh,
president of the Outdoor Art League
department of the National Civic As
sociation, asking that the San Fran
cisco organization be represented at a

Chicago on February 24. In response,
there has been forwarded a bound copy

TESTIMONIAL TO
L. M GIT.T.l^rrS BARBER SCHOOL. 'Â«
611 Commercial St.. San Francisco.
Thie is to certify that 1, the undersigned,
have attended the largest and seemingly . best
equipped barber college In Ban Francisco; for
some time I was Instructor for the largest
barber oolleÂ« in this city and by far the
largest on the Pacific Coast Notwithstanding
thiÂ» I felt inefficient and not what I thought
a barber should be. therefore I left the po- '
tion where I was emnloyed and took up a
two weeks' finishing course with Professor L.
M. Gillett, giving full credit to the other col-
leges which I attended for their Instruction
erl the practice afforded to me. I. must say,
however, that I have received more expert In-
struction from Professor L. M. Glllett in the
past two weeks than I did during the six
months spent In other colleges. The cause Is
very simple; no other college In San Francisco
has an expert Instructor In the tonsorial art;
they are not even first-class barbers,

RIGID ENFORCEMENT OF
THE IMMIGRATION LAWS
Sargent's Order Turn Back Many
Russians Seeking Refuge in
This Country.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 19. â An inves
tigation of labor conditions in New
York, conducted by Commissioner
General Sargent, has caused him to
direct the rigid enforcement of the
Immigration laws, with the result that
many Russians and Russian Jews who
are seeking refuge in this country will
be shut out. No further leniency will be
shown and only those who have the
necessary amount of money or who
have relatives who will guarantee that
they will not become public charges
will be landed.
By order of Sargent Inspectors were
sent to the headquarters of a.ll of the
New York tailors' unions. They
found that thousands of tailors were
out of work and that newly arrived
tailors were struggling for work at
from $3 50 to $5 a week. Other labor
markets were reported similarly over
stocked.
Some arrangement may be made to
divert the unprecedented rush of im
migration to the South, where men
are needed, but until this is done only
those who can comply with the letter
of the law will be landed at New York.

BERNARD GLAD
TO BE IN TOWN
Tells Large Orpheum Crowd
-Df Trials of Yiddish in
Far Away Australasia
FAVORITE IS WELCOMED
His Jokes Are Funnier Than
of Oldâ "Uncle Tonrs
Cabin" at the California
San Francisco's loyalty to her stage
favorites was demonstrated in prema
ture applause for Barney Bernard last
night at the Orpheum. Ere a welcome
curtain had completely shut out a
pain-conveying effort on the part of
Mistah Cole and Mistah Johnson to do
what neither Inherent nor acquired
talent qualified them to do in a pleas
ing way, there was anticipatory pat
tering of many hands, and when the
little Hebrew impersonator shuffled
into view a great storm of greeting
burst and raged for several minutes.
Then, to an accompaniment of giggles
that frequently developed into mirthful
roars, he told stories and sang paro
dies. His "gags" were intrinsically
funny and cleverly narrated, and his
paraphrases of popular songs carried
the charm of local application. Per
haps the best of his ditties was a wail
of regret that he had ever attempted to
introduce the Americanized Yiddisher
to an unappreciative Australian public.
The tune, "Back to Baltimore," was
admirably adapted to emphasize the
singer's gratitude at finding himself
again on O'Farrell street.
Josephine Sabel also scored heavily.
She is as "gingery" as ever, with the
same facility for taking the audience
into her confidence and keeping it
there. A tall man billed as Hayes and
a short man programmed as Healy
present a sketch that is dependent for
acceptance upon their physical diver
gence, and they make the most of that.
Bert Howard and Leona Bland do a
skit treating of life behind the scenes,
and If the lady were as artistic as her
partner the piece might be closer to
the Cressy standard of entertainment.
Delmore and Lee, aerial gymnasts,
would be worth witnessing even if they
were not aided and abetted by a wealth
of scenic, mechanical and lighting ef
fects. Nothing is lost by waiting for
the moving: pictures.
The Binging and dancing specialties
constitute the principal attraction in
"Stetson's original big: double spec
tacular production of "Uncle Tom's Ca
bin," which opened at the California
last night. Most of the members of the
company are "not colored, 'out were
born that way," and their cakewalks.
buck and wing steps and darky melo
dies consequently bear the stamp of
the genuine.
- The house was filled with people who
came to recall pleasant memories of
other years, when the deaths of Little
Eva and Uncle Tom brought tears to
their eyes and the brutality of Simon
Lpgree made their hearts palpitate
with wrath.
Tom Davis in the title role was very
good. Parnell Johnson and Hattie
Oarland were both Topsys and with
Ed Mack as Marks -created much
amusement. Don Frank caUsed shud
ders in the part of Legree. The others
of the cast performed their duties
mode-rately well. â¢
The "Creole Lady Quartet." as billed
on the programme, proved to be a trio,
but although short numerically was
loner musically. The "Lone Star Quar
tet" of the masculine gender saner
creditably. The hit of the eveniner was
the cakewalk.
The Chutes.
The circle swing 'now in operation
at the Chutes promises to be one of
the most attractive features of that re
sort. It is a unique contrivance that
whirls carloads of people round and
round over the artificial lake. The
swing is stoutly constructed of good
solid steel and passengers are strapped
to the seats to insure their safety. The
circle swing was well patronized yes
terday.
FATE SETTLES
TRI-COUNTY ROW
Chinese Commits Suicide
While Districts Are Fight
ing Over Expense of Trial
MARYSVILLE, Feb. 19.â While the
counties of Yuba and Sutter were try
ifig dally for more than a week to shift
the expense of declaring him insane
and committing him to an asylum, Ah
Lung, a demented Chinese from Chico,
jumped into the Feather River to-day
from the Yuba side of the county line
and was drowned. The body washed
down stream into another county.
The expense of dragging the river
will fall upon Yuba and Sutter coun
ties. The county into which the body
of the Chinese drifts will have to bury
it Fate seems to have settled the row,
dividing the expense.

MEN IN PRISON
Harry Silverberg's Arrest
Deprives Him of Half-
Million Dollar Clean-Up
HIS KECOKD AS FOEOER
Most Widely Famed for His
. Impersonation of J. Cole
man Drayton of New York
Special Dispatch to Tha Call.
NEW YORK. Feb. 19.â After rubbing
elbows for -three months at the fash
ionable Ansonia apartment-house with,
such towers of finance as Vice Presi
dent Gage E. Tarbell of the Equitable
Life Assurance Society and Colonel
William C. Green, the wealthy copper
magnate, Harry Silverberg, interna
tional swindler, most widely famed for
his impersonation of J. Coleman Dray
ton, has been arraigned in the Jeffer
son Market Court and remanded to po
lice headquarters for twenty-four
hours. Meanwhile the police are mak
ing every effort to present a formal
complaint against Silverberg to-mor
row in connection with the floating of a.
mining project, by which, under the
alias of J. S. Young, Silverberg boasted
he would clear $500,000.
Silverberg Is 35 years old. In the
past fifteen years he has been caught
in swindling operations in America,
Europe and Japan. His father was a
Jewish rabbi and gave him a good ed
ucation.
Among the crooked affairs In which
Silverberg Is said to have figured was
the swindling of the Bank of Mexico
of $50,000 by forged drafts, for which
he was thrown into prison, escaped and
returned to New York. He also ob
tained, it is asserted, $30,000 from a Chi
cago firm of builders, under the name
of C. Whitney Jr. His forgeries at the
German npa are said to have been
enormous.
In Budapest he obtained 40,000 marks
by fraud. He fled to CaJals and when
in the act of boarding a boat for Lon
don was arrested and taken back to
Austria. At that time Silverberg was
married and his devoted wife effected
his release. Later he parted company
with her and appeared in Baltimore,
where he eloped with a prominent soci
ety girl, whom he deserted an the
honeymoon after having robbed her of
all the money she had.
In 1901, at the Waldorf-Astoria Ho
tel, he prevailed upon a wealthy widow
to marry him. Aided by her money he
made a tour of the world and It was
upan this trip that he met and duped
Lord Curzon. He represented himself
and the woman as "J. Coleman Dray
ton and wife," and in his honor there
were garden fetes, ending with a great
elephant hunt. Before leaving India
he deposited $50,000 worth of fraudu
lent drafts.

Reckless t Acrobat Wins the
Reserve Stake After a
Series of Severe Trials
The greyhounds in the running at
Union Coursing Park yesterday earned
the dog biscuits and other dainties
which me their way after their day's
work. Th trials throughout the day
averaged fully one minute, a number
lasting nearly three minutes.
The stake was won by Reckless
Acrobat, which defeated Frank C in
the deciding trial. The winner was
led in his last three trials by Duhallow,
Renegade Apache and finally by Frank
C In each instance he then outworked
his opponent and won. . ..
In the deciding course Prank C
showed a lead of a length soon after
the greyhounds were slipped. He in
creased this to three lengths when he
took the first turn. Reckless Acrobat
was placed for two turns when Frank
C drove past him and fell. There were
several exchanges and the score was a
tie when Reckless Acrobat killed,

IRFRHMEV MAKING READY
FOR ST. PATRICK'S DAY
Committee Hold* Ita Second Meeting
and Discusses Plans for Coming
Celebration.
The second meeting: of the St. Pat
rick's day committee was held yes
terday afternoon at Knights of Red
Branch Hall on Mission street. The
executive committee reported favor
able progress on the plans recently
evolved. "The afternoon was taken
up in discussing ways and means by
which to carry on the celebration. It
is proposed to make the event the
most successful of its kind ever held
in this city. The day will be observed
5n the usual manner with patriotic ex
ercises, a ball and athletic sports. The
committee will meet again next Sun
day afternoon at. 2 o'clock.

â¢topped by the police.
tj watch Battling Nelson work, but
yesterday*! attendance was a record
breaker. Hugo Metzner was so busy
trying to accommodate Nelson's many
Hiends that he forgot to smile.
The Battler started his afternoon's
work by pulling the weights, throwing
the medicine ball and using the other
paraphernalia peculiar to a gymna
sium. Twenty minutes of this work
was indulged in without Bat pausing a
minute vo breathe. The perspiration
rolled from him, but otherwise the
strenuous work seemed to have no
affr-ct on him.
Rawhide Kelly, after performing with
the punching bap for the benefit of the
ladies present, wrestled three fast
rounds with Kelson. The work was ex
tremely rough and Rawhide was more
1 1 ;u. willing to quit.
The spectators had a run for their
money when Bat hooked up with Fred
Landers for six rounds. Landers is a
shifty boxer, baring defeated Jack
11. Ho is just the right kind of
a sparring partner for Nelson, as he
i^ constantly after the Dane. Billy
Nolan had to caution his protege many
times during the bout for fear he would
injure his hands.
Willie Britt and a number of friends
were interested spectators. Willies
visit was mainly to negotiate a match
for Jimmy in case the' Battler brings
home the money in his light with Cor
b<tt. An effort is being made to tie up
both the boxers as it is thought easier
to get th^ir signatures to a contract
now than to wait until after the fight,
when the winner would probably have
a better opinion of himself as a draw
ing card.
ANNIE RYNE
IS A STAYER
Despite Some Severe Trials
Young o'Shea's Greyhound
Takes the Reserve stake
Young Jerry O'Shea's greyhound,
Annie Ryne. scored a popular victory
at Ingleside Coursing .Park yesterday
b> winning the forty-eight dog reserve
stake. The little black daughter of
Rock Island King had some severe
trials during the day, and in each
round the talent expected her to blow
up. She upset all calculations and ran
through the stake, "defeating Sunny
South in the final, in a trial which
lasted nearly four minutes.
Sunny South did noi have nearly the
running Annie Ryne had, and in the
final he scored the first four points.
Annie then took the hare and never let
her opponent score thereafter. Sunny
South expired after the course.
Foxhunter defeated the Southern dog,
Agile Spurt, in the final of the class
event. The latter was unfortunate in
having a severe trial in the preceding
round which ruined his chances. The
hares were probably the strongest ever
seen at this park. The results follow
with Judge John Grace's official scores:

ASSOCIATION FOOTBAIiIi
TEAMS POSTIÂ»ONE GAMES
<i rounds Are Too Wot to Permit of
Playing the Championship
Matches.
Both matches set down on the
schedule of the California Association
Football League to be played yester
day for the 1904-1905 championship
were postponed. At Freeman's Park,
Golden Gate, the Independents were
announced to play against the Pick
wick eleven, but did not put in an ap
pearance. Though the ground was in
a wet condition, the Pickwicks en
gaged in a practice game.
At Idora Park. Oakland* the Oak
land Hornets were to have met the
Eagles, but the management of tho
park considered the ground too wet
to play upon. Both these matches
will be played on some later Sunday,
as they are necessary for the comple
tion of the schedule. Some of the
matches that have been postponed
will be played next Sunday, which is
an open date, and others as prelim
inary to the matches for the Union
Cup. Â«
OIiYMPIC HANDBALL PLAYEHS
TAKE TWO MORE GAMES
Cory and Levy Defeat Skelly and
Collins at the Occidental
Club.
Messrs. Cory and Levy owf the
Olympic Club handball team added two
more games to their credit yesterday
by defeating members of the Occi
dental and St. Ignatius Athletic clubs.
The games were played at the Occi
dental Club before a large 1 crowd of
handball enthusiasts. Cory had little
trouble beating Frank Skelly. Cory
did not extend himself and won as he
liked by a score of 51 to 20.
Levy had his hands full with Al Col
lins of the St. Ignatius Club. Had Col
lins been in better condition the game
might have been closer. Collins had
17 points to Levy's one and it seemed
the St. Ignatius Club man would win,
but Levy pulled himself together and
evened the score and then ran up the
score to 51. while his opponent made 28.
Collins suffered from a bad hand which
handicapped him in the game.
Eddie Antron of the St. Ignatius Club
defaulted to George Cunningham of
the Olympic Club. The tournament is
near an end. James. Cunningham and
Cory each have a game to play. So far
the Olympic Club team won 26 out of
30 games played.
Many a train of thought carries no
freight.
After his victory in the Ascot Derby
at Los Angeles last Saturday, Dr. Legr
go is sure to be favorite for the Cali
fornia Derby which will be the main
attraction at Oakland on Wednesday,
Washington's Birthday. Big Beach,
also in the Wilson stable, is an elig
j ible, but Dr. Leggo will naturally be
j the main reliance. Pasadena and Ox
ford, the colts which finished second
and third to Dr. Leggo, represent
James McLaughlin and- should he de
cide to send them up there will be
much interest added to the race. Dr.
Leggo will have to carry 127 pounds,
which would make him have equal
weight with Oxford. Cigarlighter,
Pelham and Sir Brillar, also at Ascot,
are eligibles.
Among the other three-year-olds

COLLEGIANS SEE
EVIL IN SPORTS
Many Objections Are Raised
Against Athletics by the
Presidents of Universities
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ANN ARBOR, Mich., Feb. 19.â From
thirty letters Bent to college presidents
of the Middle West Professor Victor
H. Lane of the University of Michigan
has replies condemning the "evils" of
college athletics. Professor Lane is- a
members of Michigan's board of con
trol.
These letters from men in authority
form a sort of pre-election canvass, in
dicating, among other things, that the
proposed rule barring freshmen from
athletics will not only pass the West
ern conference next June, but Is likely
to become a law throughout the entire
Middle West.
"I am persuaded," Professor Lane
says, "as is every <.-ther person with
whom I have corresponded who has
discussed the question at all, that the
rule recently adopted by the inter
collegiate committee at Chicago re
quiring a semester's attendance before
participation in college contests will be
almost a panacea for the unwise re
cruiting practices which now exist."
A classification of all the complaints
received by Professor Lane Includes,
besides gambling, objections that the
system trains a few students and ne
glects the rrlajority; that too much at
tention is paid to making money out
of athletics, and also- professionalism,
poor scholarship and laxity about en
forcing eligibility rule-
As remedies various educators would
"abolish game of football," "abolish
all proselyting and recruiting prac
tices" and "abolish gate receipts."
For Michigan, Professor Lane speaks
as follows about general charges that
eligibility rules are not enforced:
"In the half-dozen years I have been
a member of our board of control of
athletics there have been but one or
two cases in which a man has been
permitted to play on a varsity team
who had failed in his work, and then
by reason of peculiar conditions which
were thought to justify it.
"I am satisfied that one reason for
violating the rules for amateur stand-
Ing is found in the fact that a student
is not persuaded of the justice or the
reasonableness of some of them. A
rule that students should be disquali
fied because in a village celebration he
ran a foot race for boys under 14 has
something in it to make it difficult of
enforcement."

MARKSMAN RAHWYLER OUTSHOOTS
HIS YOUNGER OPPONENTS.
BOISTEROUS WEATHER FAILS
TO DETER THE RIFLEMAN
Th>; rifle range at Schuetzen Park
was well patronized yesterday by
marksmen. The boisterous weather
did not dampen the ardor of the many
enthusiasts who took part in the dif
ferent contests. The principal attrac
tions of the day centered on the bulls
eye targets and the rivalry was keen
during the entire proceedings.
Abraham Rahwyler, the veteran, who
so successfully upheld the honor of
California in fhe centennial contest of
1876 at Philadelphia, when the Cali
fornians won against the world, carried
off the honors of the day with the good
score of 162 points in the bullseye shoot.
His nearest competitor was Max Ko
lander with 233, which was also a good
center.
August Studer, with 404 rinirs. won
the champion medal of the Grutll Club.
The second champion medal was cap
tured by Thedore Simmen. In the first
class Ori Imdorf led his classmates.
The second class medal fell to Charles
Mueller, who was also the lucky win
ner of the Reubold trophy.
A. J. Brannagan, a new addition to
the ranks of the marksmen, surprised
his fellow members of the California
Schuetzen Club by making four bulls
eyes in the first six shots and won one
of the prizes of the contest. The re

JANES LOSES
TO GARDNER
Tennis Experts Play an Ex
citing Practice Match on
California Club Courts
The wind and sun dried the courts of
the California Tennis Club late in the
afternoon yesterday and a few of the
enthusiasts enjoyed a little practice be
fore darkness set in. By far the most
interesting match was the singles be
tween George Janes and Carl Gardner.
These two players, who rank one and
two in the continuous tournament, met
last Sunday, when Janes carried off
the honors. Yesterday's match was a
practice game and as was expected
Gardner played a better game.
In the tournament match he had such
a big lead In both sets that It hardly
looked possible for him to lose them.
Janea won both sets and kept Gard
ner in No. 2 position. When they meet
again in the tournament it would not
be surprising if Gardner should take
a fall out of his rival. Many of the ex
perts figured if Gardner could once
beat Janes the ice would be broken
and the No. 1 would not be secure in
his position at the top of the tourna
ment.
The two cracks played a fast game
from start to finish. Gardner won the
first set, 6-3, and Janes the. second.
6-4. Gardner outplayed his opponent
in the third set and won quite handily.
Janes fought hard at the finish and
almost won the last game. He pulled up
from 0-40 to vantage, but there was
nothing at stake and Gardner won.
Dr. Younger and W. S. MacGavin.
two of the club's oldest players, clayed
a spirited one-set match. They were
so evenly matched that neither could
get two games ahead. Finally when
the score stood 11-11 they decided to let
one game settle it. Dr. Younsrer won
this game, which gave him the set.
Both players are base line experts and
as a result the rallies were exception
ally long.
Paul Jones and Herbert Bchmidt won
three sets out of five from George
Janes and W. G. Knowlton. The latter
won the first two sets, but in the next
three Jones and Schmidt played most
of the balls to Knowlton. which en
abled them to win out by a small mar
pin. Knowlton was In faster company
than usual, but played well. The score
was 4-6, 4-6, 7-5. 7-5, 6-3.
Dr. Noble and William Murphy
played a four-set tie. The doctor won
the first two sets, but Murphy took the
next two. The score was 6-0. Â«-4,
4-6, 4-6.
On the park courts this afternoon
Miles McLaughlin and R. Strachan
will play the final match of the handi
capped singles tournament for boys.
The match was started last Saturday,
but was unfinished. McLauehlin will
give Strachan a handicap of "owe 15."
The winner will receive the handsome
Reed & Barton cup.
On Wednesday there will be a handi
cap doubles tournament on the Cali
fornia Club courts. Entries close to
morrow afternoon at 5 o'clock, when
the drawing will be held.
Model Yachts on Spreckcls Lake.
The threatening weather yesterday
did not keep the model yachtsmen
away from Spreckels Lake. Eight en
thusiasts Had their models out, but the
trial races held were unsatisfactory.
This was due to the freaky wind which
prevailed. It was a difficult matter to
get the boats away from the shore and
the wind, which was strong shifted so
often that it was almost impossible
to get a course.
The following boats met in im
promptu races: W. Johnson's Spreck
els, Genung's Witch, Peterson's Stella.
Brown's Surprise, Jurgen's Zampa.
London's Cricket, Brannon's Sophie
and Roeckner's Annie.
Next Sunday there- will be a regatta,
the winner of which will meet the
Cricket and Apache for the Dickie cup.
On Wednesday there will be practice
races.
Some automobiles are called run
abouts and others should be known as
stupabouts.

GOES TO COURT
TO LEARN CRIME
San Jose Man Hears Testi
mony of Counterfeiter and
Immediately Becomes One
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 19.â Evidence
which he heard at the trial of James
Hlckok Carey, the San Franciaco at
torney accused of shaving 120 gold
pieces, suggested to James Mallet
Hawkins a means of earning an easy
living. Following Carey's example he
proceeded to extract gold dust from
coins. To-night Hawkins was arrested
by United States secret service officers.
Sufficient evidence is said to have been
found to leave no doubt as to his guilt.
Hawkins, who is a young man, says
his home is in San Jose and that he is
a member of a reputable family.
For some time many short-weight
$20 pieces have been in circulation here
and the number was increasing. The
Federal authorities began working on
the case and the arrest of Hawkins to
night was the result. The officers
found coins in his possession from
which as much as $4 had been taken.
Hawkins told the officers that he
heard the evidence at the trial of an
attorney who was accused of similar
crimes, and that the ease with which
the work was done suggested the crime
to him and resulted in his downfall.
English Poloists Go South.
There was no polo game at Bur
tingame yesterday, the English players
making a hurried pilgrimage to River

games. F. J. Mackey has offered a

ers are expected back here about
March 1. They did not take all their
ponies south.

WITTMAN STILL
HAS A CHANCE
Should He Be Deposed as
Chief He May Return to
the Position of Captain
COMMISSION'S QUANDARY
Police Board at Loss to
Understand Inference in
Report of the Grand Jury
Even if George Wittman is removed
from office as the head of the Police
Department by action of the Police
Commissioners there is doubt in the
minds of his friends â and those who
have given the legal situation in his
case some study â whether the verdict
will mean his permanent separation
from the force. When Wittman was
appointed Chief by the board that
superseded the Poheim-Reagan-Drink
hcuse regime he was not seeking the
position. He was a captain by rank
a.nd satisfied with the position that
had been assigned to him.
Ex-Commissioner Newhall, it is said,
first made the proposition to Wittman
to take command of the department,
but Wittman replied that he did not
think it would be a good move for him
to tnake as he was getting along very
nicely in his capacity of captain and
that the worry and trouble attaching
to the chieftancy would more than off
set the difference in salary. Wittman
had done fair and impartial service in
the position of captain, according to
the ideas of Mr. Newtyill and his col
leagues on the Police Board, and he
urged Wittman to accept the offer,
even if he should elect to retain the
position for o;ily a brief period.
Then it was that Wittman stipulated
that if he accepted the responsibilities
of the head of the Police Department
he should not lose his opportunity of
retiring to the most modest position
of captain if he saw fit to do so. In
this way Wittman has never tendered
an official resignation to the board and
ft! the judgment of many this means
that he has all along served simply as
a substitute Chief.
The charges of "incorrfpetency and
dereliction of duty" as Chief of Police
would not necessarily mean that he is
not competent to be a captain. The
natural conclusion under the circum
stances is that should the Commission
ers remove him from office, and his
contest for reinstatement should fail,
hÂ« still has the department to fall back
upon with the rank of captain as his
goal.
ELLIS' FATE IX BALANCE.
Sergeant Thomas Ellis' trial will
come to a finale this evening, when
Benterice will be passed upon the ac
cused officer. EUis has had consider
able support in his fight for retention.
The uncertainty of the Grand Jury re
port and its evasions in the matter of
failing to present definite evidence of
just where the fault for the corrup
tion in Chinatown may be placed has
caused the Police Commissioners to
study very seriously as to whether
Ellis should be made the scapegoat of
the nasty scandal or not. The pack
age of money that Ellis turned over to
the Grand Jury was in its original
covering of paper and it is not known
to any degree of certainty whether it
was taken by Ellis at the instigation
of the grand Jurors for the purpose
of acquiring evidence against the real
boodlers or whether it was surrend
ered by the accused sergeant because
of inability to stand up against the
severe â¢ cross-examination of the in
quisitorial body tending to establish
his guilt.
It is reported that ex-Chief of De
tectives John Seymour told Ellis that
the jurors had evidence that tended to
incriminate all members of the China
town police force and that it was
known that the corruption fund was
passed along the line from the patrol
men to "the high office," whatever
that may have meant. Ellis, so the
story goes, was told to act as if he
was in on the old policy of graft that
har been in vogue for twenty-five years
in Chinatown and to get possession of
the mysterious "sack" that for years
had been known only in astral form
and not in actuality so far as the pub
lic and the press were concerned.
SERGEANT EVADES QUESTIONS.
Ellis is said to have followed in
structions, but he caused a pang of
sincere regret among the grand jurprs
after having "delivered the goods" he
failed to be a party to proving that
th<- sack reached any one in particular
other than minor officers of the police
force. Of course it went somewhere,
but who got it Ellis couldn't or
wouldn't tell and the jurors said,
"Well, we have part of the evidence â
he took it, and we will condemn him
and go after the other fellows in spite
of the protection that he is trying to
afford them."
Following this came the report of
the Grand Jury in abbreviated form,
as was outlined in The Call the morn
ing prior to its delivery for publication
that afternoon. The report was an ab
stract of a mass of shorthand and
lenghand notes taken by the Grand
Jury stenographers and reporters and
contained an inference that the sack
had spilled its golden contents in the
laps of other than men who wear the
blue cloth and the silver star. The infer
ence was resented by the Commission
ers and they postponed judgment upon
Ellis until to-night, hoping to gather
further information as to just what the
Grand Jury is driving at.

PAYS TRIBUTE
TO THE DEAD
Ancient Order of United
Workmen Honors Memory
of Departed Brethren
HOLDS SOLEMN SERVICE
William H. Barnes Delivers
Eulogy Telling the Good
Deeds of Those Mourned
Most solemn memorial services in
connection with the Ancient Order of
United Workmen took place yesterday
afternoon at Golden Gate Hall. C. T.
Spencer, grand recorder, presided and
the audience included numerous well
known and active members of the or
der. The exercises were under the
auspices of the Past Master" Work
men's Association of San Francisco,
and to the veteran member, William
H. Barnes, P. G. M. W., fell the duty
of delivering the eulogy.
He spoke feelingly of those who had
been called from their great organiza
tion by death and made touching ref
erence to John Jordan Upchurch, whu
founded the order in Meadville, P^.., in
1867.
Ninety-six members had passed
away, he said, in San Francisco in 1904,
and during his membership 75,000 of
the brethren had been called to their
rest. They had devoted their lives to
principles, principles which were like
sparkling gems, for they were princi
ples which led them to do good for
their fellow man, to wipe away the
tear of the widow and aid the orphan.
He told how little things well done in
life tended to bring happiness to those
in sorrow, and how a word of kindness
often soothed a broken heart.
Those members who had been called
by death had accomplished a great
deal by the "little things" they had
done and their acts had refreshed the
earth. They had been faithful and
the world was the better that such
men had lived.
D. S. Hirshberg, P. G. M. W., deliv
ered a stirring address in which he also
paid honor to the dead.
The service was as follows:
Invocation, Rev. Louis J. Sawyer; organ
voluntary "March Funebre" (Chopin), Chafles
S. Hoffman; introductory remarks, C. T. Spen
cer, grand recorder: Knickerbocker Male Quar
tet, "When the Mists Have Rolled Away";
address, D. S. Hirshberg P. G. M. W. ; solo.
"Abide With Me," Miss" Klla V. McCloskey;
recitation, "Oh Why Should the Spirit of Mor
tal Be Proud? 11 Miss Olive Pearl Miller;
Knickerbocker Male Quartet. "Crossing the
Bar"; eulogy, William H. Barnes, P. G. M.
W. ; Knickerbocker Male Quartet. "God Be
With You Till We Meet Again"; congregation,
"America," first and last stanzas; benediction.
Dies a Slave to Morphine.
George Long, a well known mor
phine "fiend," was found lying on the
sidewalk on California street, near
Kearny, early yesterday morning by
Policeman Keohane, who thought he
was drunk. He was sent to the City
Prison, but his groans a few hours
later attracted the attention of the
prison officials and he was sent to the
Harbor Emergency Hospital, where he
died in about an hour. Dr. Bacigalupi
made an autopsy and found that death
was due to morphinism and tuber
culosis. Sergeant Moffltt thought Long
was the son of "Dave" Long, a well
known clown forty years ago, when
there was a circus on Jackson street,
but after viewing the body he came to
the conclusion that he was mistaken.
Long was about 45 years of age.

good milling wheat the manufacture of fluur
on a much larger scale -may add' to the pros
perity of the region. In a. similar way 'the
success of Indian corn culture may develop
manufacturing ? possibilities.
Among the most common articles manufac
tured from wheat ' and corn are starch, mac

made into starch -and various other products
of the farmland garden are manufactured into
articles of everyday use. but few of the facto

. : A few years ' ago it was discovered that
prusslc ; acid may be .extracted from apricot
pits. The pits are now saved, but are shipped
elsewhere for manufacture. -;
Hemp has been produced with great success,
but the extension of hemp culture Is retarded
by the necessity of sending the fiber East for
manufacture. Flax Is grown successfully and
profitably, but only the seed is saved, owing
to . the fact that there -is: no market here for
the fiber., - Tests have been made i with cotton,
that seem to demonstrate the suitability of cli

reason to believe the production and manufac

duced successfully and profitably. â  â ,
Among, the most promising of industrial op
portunities are those afforded by the deposits
of many <" minerals. Including building stone,
pottery, clay, lime, cement and ochre. These
deposits are' capable of sustaining giant enter
prises, the t existence of which will cheapen
building operations, employ thousands of peo
j ple, provide a home- market for the products
of orchard and garden and handsome dividends
to those who establish the enterprises. Op
portunities for profit to investors and com
munity alike exist in many deposits of Iron,
asbestos, gold, silver and. copper. -
The forests provide a wealth of manufactur
ing opportunities. Heretofore lumbering j op
erations have been confined to the production
of rough lumber, sash, doors, molding and
building material of larger kinds. With the
erection of i the Diamond Match ' Company's
plant . at Chico the era of manufacture oC
smaller wood products will be inaugurated.
â¢ The plant introduction garden of the United
States Department .of Agriculture, j located at
j Chico, ;. is experimenting j with a | rush which
; may prove suitable for manufacture Into car
j pet matting. Many roots have been planted
1 at the Chico garden and a careful effort will
be : made to determine the possibilities of the!
plant for matting manufacture. â¢ /
.There- are Immense possibilities of Indus
trial growth in the successful culture of this
plant. A concern which now manufactures
matting in Maine from grass imported from
Japan has signified a desire to construct
looms for the purpose of manufacturing mat
ting from the plant found growing -wild in the ,
Gutter Basin .of -the Sacramento j Valley. All
the matting used in the United States is Im- !
ported or is manufactured from imported ma
terials. 'Millions of . : yards of , carpet â¢ matting j
are used annually. It is a cheap floor covering I
rapidly growing in popularity. . . y
The growing of this grass must result in j
the building in the valley of a great matting '
manufacturing industry. The logical place for â 
establishing these factories Is near the point
of production and therefore Sacramento Valley
factories \ will certainly ! follow the success of
the experiments now being carried on at

PLEADS CAUSE
OF EX-CONVICTS
Mrs. Ballington Bootli of
Volunteers of America
Makes Eloquent Address
Mrs. Ballington Booth, head of the
Volunteers of America and also known
as the "Little Mother of the Convicts,"
addressed a large assemblage at Cal
vary Presbyterian Church last night
on "After Prisonâ What ?"
She knew her subject. For nine years
she has worked among the convicts in
prisons East and West with wonder
ful results.
"The time to begin reformation is
within the prison cell." declared Mrs.
Booth. "Let the prisoner begin to
drill and train for a better life while
he is yet behind the bars, and when
the prison doors swing open and he is
free the world will be ready to receive
him. 'Begin now,' I say to them, or
you will be swept away by the old
tide. 1 "
The speaker introduced many anec
dotes of prison life as graphic as pages
from Dickens. These were tales that
rang true, tales of broken hearts, of
good resolutions battered down by the
suspicions of those who should have
helped, of intense suffering and wo
men's devotion stronger than disgrace
or death.
Mrs. Booth's views on the habitual
criminal differ from those of eminent
psychologists. She said: "I raise my
voice against branding the habitual
criminal as a hopeless pervert. As
one who has given nine years to this
study I maintain that the habitual
criminal in this land has been manu
factured. The chance of reform wai
denied him."
She drew a pathetic picture of the
ex-convict vainly striving to overcome
the prejudices of the world. Up till
the time the Volunteers took up the
work, she declared, there was little
chance for the ex-convict. He waa
driven back to the" prison, she said,
and the tale of his unsuccess embit
tered those behind the bars.
The speaker spoke for better and
more sanitary prisons and declared
that prisoners should be permitted to
work. "You have the right to pun
ish." she said, "but you cannot break
down or brutalize."
Colonel and Mrs. Duncan of the Vol
unteers were on the platform with
Mrs. Booth.
Civil War Veteran Dies.
ALAMEDA, Feb. 18. â William H.
Pixon, who served through the Civil
War with the Massachusetts volun
teers, died last night at his home. 17 27
Union street. He was 61 years of age
and is survived by his wife. Dixon
was a member of Lyon Post. Grand
Army of the Republic, of Oakland.
His funeral will be held to-morrow
afternoon under the auspices of the
G. A. R.
Store Entered by Burglars.
The grocery store of John Van
Arsdale at 428 Sixth street was en
tered by burglars yesterday morning
between midnight and 6 o'clock. The
thieves broke the lock on the door.
Once inside they searched all the cash
drawers in quest of coin, but were
only rewarded by finding sixty cents
in the telephone bcvx. The matter
was reported to the Southern Police
station.
Recovers Stolen Property.
Property consisting of a typewriter,
a raincoat and some billiard balls
stolen out of the Building Trades
Council quarters at 927 Mission street
a few nights ago, waa recovered yes
terday by Detectives Reagan and
O'Connell of the Southern district.
They arrested Frank J. Harris and
charged him with burglary. Harris
is an old offender and when the burg
lary was reported to the police the
detectives suspected him of being the
culprit.
There have been unearthed at Bury
St. Edmunds. England, traces of a Ro
man villa, yielding fragments of 9a
mian and Romano-British pottery.
