CITY OFFICIALS-ELECT MAY BE DISQUALIFIED.
WIDE INQUIRY IS SET ON FOOT
According to the records of the registration office,; Dr.; J: -Walsh;
Goroncr-elect, has not been a qualified elector of -this^city ; for; the five years
next preceding his election as the charter of San -Francisco- requires
a' niinor five years ago. Besicies this case : there are- under. dnquiry those of
Su^cryisbrs-elect Andrew M. Wilson,/ Jennings Phillips; and; John J. Furey.
Contests are to be filed before the ;first of the new-year.

the succcEEful candidates at the municipal
election of November T. For several days
a quiet investigation has been in progress
&s to the eligibility of several of the men
\u25a0who stand elected on the face of the re
turns. The result of the Inquiry is that
the right of Dr. "William J. Walsh to take
h's seat in January as Coroner is not only
disputed, but. It is claimed, he is ab
eolutely disqualified tinder the provisions
of the charter. The same condition is de
clared to exist In the case of Jennings J.
Phillips, one of the Supervisors-elect, and
Andrew M. Wilson and John "J. Fure^,
also Supervisors-elect, "are among the men
whoee records with regard \to eligibility
are under further investigation.
Tha fact that an, inquiry was on foot
which went to. the legal qualifications of
many of the. elected nominees to serve lr
the various capacities to which* they had
aspired became public yesterday, and
caused a hurrying and a scurrying among
the candidates who were " said \u0084 to be
affected.
How far the results of these search-
Ingrs will go cannot be determined, un
til aM of the records have* 1 been , exam
ined. The trouble appears -to .-be -that
nominations were made by the Union
Labor party convention without thor
ough examination Into the legal quali
fications of some of their candidates.
The rock upon which the candidates
appear to have struck' is in a provision
of the municipal charter \u25a0 which â¢ re
quires that certain city and " county
officials ehall have been electors of the
city. and county for. at. least, five years
next preceding their election. "','.

SENATOR J. RALPH BURTON
ONCE MORE ON TRIAL.
His Hearing Begun
in Court in
St. Louis.
Receipt of Money
Admitted by
Defense
ST. LOUIS, Nov. 20.â For the second
time within two years. United States
Hc-nator J. Ralph Burton of Kansas to
*lay was called upon to defend hims*l l
in the United Statfs Circuit Court
against an indictment which charges that
.he was offered and accepted compensa
tion from the Rjalto Grain and Securi
ties Company, now defunct, for using his
Influence while a, member of the United
BtatPs Senate in behalf of that concern
in certain matters j*endiug before the
Postoffice Department at Washington.
Senator Burton was tried and con
victed on the rirst indictment in March,
1904. He appealed to the United States
Supreme Court and the case' was r**
versed. A new indictment was returned
last spring, and about a month ago de
murrers filed by counsel for the defense
were sustained by United States Circuit
Judge Vandevanter, who immediately or
dered thai a new grand jury be s=um
xnoned to consider the evidence in the
possession of the United States District
Attorney.
On November 10. eight days before the
etatute of limitations became effective,
the third and present indictment against
Senator Burton was returned. Demur
rers to this and a plea in bar filed by
Senator Burton's attorneys were over
ruled by Judse Vandevanter and the case
went to trial. .5/ -
The salient point of difference between
the first and third indictments is that in
the former Senator Burton was charged
with receiving the alleged compensation
in Washington. D. C. and one of the
points* on which the Supreme Court re
versed the conviction was that the St.
Louis court did not have jurisdiction,
\u25a0while the present indictment alleges that
Burton agreed to accept and did accept
compensation for his influence in St.
Louis.
SENATOR BURTON IX COURT.
When court convened at 10 o'clock this
morning Senator Burton was present, ac
companied by his attorney, Frederick W.
Lehmann of St, Louis. The Government
is represented by Colonel D. P. Dyer.
United States District Attorney, assisted
by Charles H. Robb, assistant to the
Attorney General of the United States,
and Horace Dyer, assistant to the District
Attorney.
The jury was sworn before noon, and
Colonel Dyer, the District Attorney, de
livered the opening statement > of the
Government's case. Attorney Lehmann
followed and outlined to the jury the
position that will be taken by the de
fense. He admitted that Senator Bur
ton had been employed by the Rlalto
Grain and Securities Company, but laid
stress upon the fact that the president
of the company. Major Hugh C. Dennis,
now dead, was at that time under in
dictment by the Federal grand jury, and
contended that the principal reason for
Senator Burton's employment was that
lie was expected to assist at Dennis* trial.
That he did not do so. Lehmann said,
was due to the fact that Major Dennis
was advised that he had already such
en array of legal talent that the pres
ence of Senator Burton and the mem
bers of a St. Louis firm of attorneys
â¢whom he was about to engage would
overwelgh his case with counsel.
ARGUBIEXT OF DEFENSE.
Lehmann contended that the visits Sen
ator Burton paid to the Postoffice De
partment officials were not for the pur
pose of influencing action in regard to
the matters in which the Rialto com
pany itself was interested, but for the
purpose of investigating the case against
Major Dennis.
Attorney Lehmann admitted the pay
ment to Senator Burton of $500 In the of
fices of the Rialto company In St. Louis
on March 26. 1903. but declared that it
vas simply the last of the monthly, pay-

WITHOUT NAME
Important Discovery Made
by Several Miners and an
Assayer Xear Salt Creek
Special Dispatch to The Call,
REDDING. Nov. 20.-Several miners in
the Salt Cr*ek district near Redding and
one assayer in Redding believe they have
discovered a new metal. Chemists have
long claimed that fourteen varieties are
lacking to com^te the circuit In the
mineral kingdom. About five years ago
when radium was unearthed the missing
sorts were reduced to thirteen. The new
species found near Salt Creek is com
posed of grains about the size of flax
seed, it glitters like polished silver, is
considerably heavier than , gold, and
where it is found the yield of the yel
low metal invariably ends. The metal
is malleable also, and Is a puzzler to all
who have 6<?en it. A. H. Sprague, who
has mining Interests north of Shasta,
says he has often come in contact with
this unknown metal. In the. washing pro
cess he says the gold always horns upon
It. Mr. Sprague proposes to gather to
gether enough of the curious species to
make a respectable sample when a chem
ical analysis will be made of it.
ments agreed upon when Senator Bur
ton was engaged. Mr. Lehmann said
that In regard to the charge that Sena
tor Burton had used his influence while
a member of the United States Senate
to prevent the Postoffice Department
from issuing a fraud order against the
Rialto company. Lehmann said:
We will prove that while it is true that! the
affairs of the Rialto company were under) In
vestigation by postoffice inspectors 'at Wash
ington, recommendation from United States
District Attorney Oyer was received that I a
fraud order be not issued, and that this was
approved by Assistant United State* Attorney
General Robb. assigned by the Postoffice De
partment.
In tact, gentlemen, the fraud order was not
issued upon the recommendation of the very
officials who are now prosecuting Senator Bur
ton on the charre of using his Influence for
that result.

KANSAS CITY. Nov. 20. â Secretary
of War William ILTaft. 'who wa|?guest
of honor here to-niffht. at the annual
banquet of the Commercial Club. In
responding tV the toast, "The Philip
pines," said:
"The Philippine Islands are ours, and
must be ours- for' a generation. ,It is
quite â¢ probable- that-'; those /called ; upon
to act as legislators will not live to
see the day when. separation consistent
with the welfare of the Philippines
can be made." . . "' L . :
The occasion; of .the banquet was
the anniversary of the signing of the
John Jay, commercial treaty. Thou-,
sands of persons greeted Secretary Taft
during the day, and everywhere! he was
given . the most enthusiastic reception.
After the dinner he; left for Chicago on
a special train over the Chicago and
Alton.- Secretary Taft was given' an
ovation when he arose to speak. He
said in part: v -*>
In all the lPglstlatlon for which Congress is
responsiblo affecting the Philippine Islaiifls
thero are. bat two acts which can be .criticized
as- bavins a tselflsh motive. One Is what we
might call the coastwise act, the ' effect ' of
which is to require that after July 1. 19CW, all
freight from the Philippine Islands to thÂ»
United States and the reverse shall be carried
in American bottoms. '.And the other Is. the.
law by. which there Is imposed on products of
the Philippine Islands coming Into the United
Statee 75 per cent of the Dingley rates. If
the coastwise act Is ptrmitted to come info
effect and the, tax upon Philippine jiroducts is
not removed, we have. Congress assuming the
utterly indefensible position that fcr the pur
pose of the sale ot the Philippine products l.v
the Filipinos. the Philippines shall bÂ« regardfid
and treated aa a foreign country, while for the
purpose of furnishing business tfÂ» the Ami-h
can merchant marine they shall be treated aÂ«
a domestic country and shall bo made to pay
the higher rates of freight which .euch a coast
wise provision necessarily .entails and implies.
The object of my. coming to Kansas City ia
to enllet your sympathy In an \u25a0 effort co to
amend the ' laws on . our statute books
that we shall be consistent in our conduct . of
the Philippines and. shall repeal laws which
Will give the He to every assertion of disinter
estedness and good faith in our dealing with
our wards of the Paciflc.
The legislation proposed for the relief of the
Philippines is an act postponing the applicu-'
tlon of the coastwise trading laws to the trade
between the Philippine Islands and the United
States until' l9oll,-- the reduction, of the . tariff
on sugar and tobacco from 75 per cent to 23
per cent of the Dingley rates and on othÂ«>r
products of the Philippines free trade until
1900. when there shall be complete free trade
in the products of either. v :-

interest.

IN LIVE STOCK CASE
OLD RATES WILL STAND
CIRCUIT JI7DGB OF CHICAGO. WHO RULED THAT THE ACTION OF THE IX
TERSTATE BOARD IX ORDERING THE RAILROADS TO MAKE A LOWER
RATE ON LIVESTOCK WAS ILLEGAL. .-.::
CHICAGO, Nov. 20.â Judge Bethea, in
the United States Circuit Court to-day,
decided that the order issued by the In
terstate Commerce Commission directing
that the railroad rates on livestock be
tween the Missouri River and Chicago
be lowered to conform with the rates
on dressed beef was Illegal.
The Chicago Great Western and seven
teen other railroad corporations were the
defendants In two suits brought by the
Interstate Commerce Commission. The
first related to the decision of the com
mission, in which the lowering of rates
en livestock to a point where they would
conform with the rates on dressed beef
was ordered. The second was an appli
cation on the part x>t the cornimss. ( <jn for
an Injunction against" the railroads 4 , pro
hibiting them from refusing to lowtr the
rates.
In summing up the case. Judge Bethea
declared that there was no evidence of
collusion on the part of the railroads and
that the rates on livestock were not. a
discrimination. He held further that the
Interstate Commerce Commission decree
\u25a0was not binding on the railroads and that
the commission had not the power to
compel the railroads to obey their rulings.

Menace to the Lives of
American Children;
At a recent meeting of the executive
committee of the National Association
of State Dairy and Food Departments
the secretary of a State board made the
assertion, and produced figures to prove
it, that the death of nearly half a mil-
lion little children in America last year
was due to poisons administered in lm-
jmre foods. aÃlMÃÃqpÃ^BM^jaMMMfllJsiqajj
Think of this! Nearly half a million
children sacrificed to the murderous
greed of food adulterators! It behooves
us all to have a care in selecting the
food that comes into our. homes. The
health and li\-es of our children and
our own health are at stake/nQsli
Welcome. Indeed,, is a food that is
known to be pure and 'wholesome, rich '
in nutrition and frooa to catâ co good
ihat no other food can take its place.
We refer to Malta-Vita, that â¢ delicious i
crisp, whole- wheat food. Among' all
the cereal foods we believe we are war-
ranted in saying that Malta- Vita is the !
only food that is simply and wholly ;
pure " grain product and nothing else,
except a little salt. It Is free from any
foreign" sweetening agent or, other
adulterant, and is made in 'absolute
cleanliness
A perfect breakfast is impossible
without Malta-Vita, and it's Just as

NO CONCESSIONS
TO UNITARIANS
NEW YORK, Nov. 20.â The Interchurch
Conference on Federation to-day changed
the wording of the phrase, "Jesus Christ,
Our . Lord and Savior," in the preamble
of the constitution of the Federal Council,
to read "Jesus Christ, Our Divine Lord
and* Savior."- It is understood that this
change will exclude from membership in
the Federal Council the Unitarians, jon
the ground' that they do not accept the
theory of the divinity of Jesus Christ;
The addresses delivered to-day concerned
themselves chiefly with discussions of the
prospective practical benefit of the con
ference. An amendment to allow other
churches to join the Federal Council pro
posed by Professor James Q. Dealey, pro
fessor of social and political science of
Brown University, was defeated- Profes
sor Dealey is the head of the Rhode Isl
and Federation of Churches and Christian
Workers, a body which Includes both
Unlversalists and Unitarians. .
A plea for Roman Catholics to Join the
federation was made \by Rev. L. C.
Barnes of Worcester, Mass. He began by
speaking in favor of the Unitarians
UnlvcrsalisLs, . saying:
"I would be glad to see. the few who do
not respond to the full divinity of Jesus
Christ come into the assembly. I have
no fear that the millions of Methodists,
Baptists and Presbyterians would be in
the least harmed, by the thousands of
Unitarians and ', Universalists. '_\u25a0, I should
regard it as a splendid advance If they
did come in. ' .x'-j'j'.'lf
"But there are other bodies which I for.
one should like to see have : representa
tives. I would like to see the door opened
to the Roman Catholics, who certainly be
lieve enough."
Rev. Dr. Roberts, the permanent chair
man, said that Roman Catholics were not
excluded by the terms of the proposition
of federation. .
Rev*. N. Dwight Hillis, chairman of the
evangelistic work' of the National Coun
cil of Congregational Churches of ; the
United States, told the preachers not to
break their hearts If they had large con
gregations in the morning and but a few !
In the evening. He said . if they would
only hire theaters, they could get the peo-'
pie to attend service.
-"There were two theaters open last
nlght/v he said, "and If you and I do not
use the forty theaters on Sundays, there
will soon be a time when the theaters will
be open from the Atlantic to the; Pacific
on Sundays." .
At the evening' session Judge P. 8.
Grosscup of. the United States Court of
Chicago ; contributed the first paper^n
"The Popular Conscience" in a discussion
of the un.Â«.ed church and the national life.
Justice, David J.: Brewer of the Supreme
Court of the United States read a paper
on "Law ' and Justice.'/ : He said :'-.\u25a0.,, \u25a0'\u25a0
I look "and hope for a federation closer than
that adopted , by. the conference. \u25a0 , Very ' likely
it was tetter to take a short step forward
than â¢to ri*k failure by going: too ; far. The
man who cannot . work ~ with Edward . Everett
Hale and Cardinal Gibbons has no clear con
ception of . the ' goodaess ; of i God. . . I gay \u25a0 that
if all cannot* admit the dK-lnity \u25a0 of* Christ
they are yet ail followers of bis leadership.
Law and Justice, should : coincide;; unfortu
nately they do not. \u25a0" If this were brought about
there woild be no need cf supervision of banks
or Insurance, companies. The" church; would
be a sort; of mutual insurance company,- whops
salaries â¢ Jind policies would only be payable
by the cwhler up yonder. ;There would be no
tainted tfioney; the law of injunction would
drop Into* harmless "desuetude; ; the Chinaman'
would lew-n a new/idea of American r Justice.
.What grtater. power Is there to accomplish
this tkan a federated church? \u25a0 Such a body
could reform New York and make Philadelphia
pood nnd Chicago clean. -\u25a0 , " "

Persons of Note in Great
Britain Included Among
the First-Class Passengers
LONDON, Nov. 20â One hundred and
twenty-eight pentons lost their lives In
the wreck of the London and 'South
iretitern Hallway- Company's steamer
Hilda off the ' northern coast of France
Saturday nist:t, according to an-offi
cial estimate given out to-night by the
official* . of - the . company. This roll In
cludes twenty-one "saloon passengers,
eighty French onion and potato sellers
and twenty-scveu of the crew. - '
ST. MALO, .France,- Nov. 20.âReali
zation of the full extent of the disas
ter to the. Cross Channel steamship
Hilda- came to the people of -St.; Malo
as reports of v the- finding of bodies were
received from different . points -along
the nearby coast. In air more than
sixty bodies liave been washed up, In
cluding that of Captain Gregory, the
commander of the wrecked ship, whicli
now lies In the hospital here, and as
fast as other bodies arrive they will
be placed in a room prepared : for their
reception.
.Thirteen bodies of saloon â¢ passengers
have been identified.'. These are Mrs.
Rook, her two children and \u25a0 their gov
erness; Dr. Stanley, his wife; and two
daughters and a maid; Major and ;Mrs.
Price, Mr;. Wellesley and Mr. Grindle. \u25a0.-_-â¢'
The survivors are rapidly recover
ing.
James Gunter, the only seaman
saved from the wreck." says there was
no panic on board. Attempts were
made to lower the boats,; but the rough
sea rendered it -impossible. ;Gunter
clung to the fittings of 'the: topmast
with nine others below him, including
the chief mate and three Bretons, who
died of .exposure during the night.
The Hilda struck at 10 o'clock on Sun
day night. She was going very slowly at
the time. .' Rockets were sent \u25a0 up, but
there was no^ response.' Seven minutes
later, the * ship broke amidships and her
decks were swept bare, with the (excep
tion of the few survivors who clung to
the mast. They were , rescued by â¢ the
steamship Ada at \u25a0 10 j o'clock this 9 morn
ing, after having endured twelve hours
of agony. . ..." - '
In response to the - captain's 'appeal,
when he found it would be useless to at
tempt to launch the boats, all the women
and children mustered oh the main hatch
and the stewardesses" .fixed -life belts
around each of them, < the French onion
sellers assisting in the work. Every
body was very quiet
Gunter says there were about twenty
persons in the rigging, when the vessel
foundered. lie describes ,. ; pathetically
how the men gradually dropped off, . ex
hausted by the terrible cold, : and says
the roar of the elements was. awful. As
the men fell off they ejaculated ;.
"We have had enough of. this."; It does
not matter how we die. Good-by." '
Gunter himself fought 'against. a- strong
inclination to sleeD and says that at the
time of. his rescue '. he 1 cared little what
became of him. \u25a0-.â¢-â¢ ..- i . , .
\u25a0 PARIS, . Nov/ 20.â -^Special reports re
ceived here of the wreck ,of the-steam
ship Hilda give , a graphic description, of
the disaster. Owing to the; rough; sea,
together with a thick snowstorm, the
captain of the Hilda probably . took , the
buoy light of the rocks for the St.Maio*
lighthouse. He gave signals which \ were
not seen by. harbor employes, and. then
the steamship proceeded : slowly toward
the light When the Hilda struck the
rocks, her boilers exploded and she was
cut in two, giving the passengers no
time to save themselves.
\u25a0'\u25a0. Seven bodies wearing life, belts were
stranded off the. village of St. Cast yes
terday evening. The coast. near St. Malo
is covered with wreckage and the car
casses of \u25a0 cattle.
Two-thirds of the Hilda's passengers
were French farmers returning to France
with heavy "sums of gold for the yearly
harvest'; ; of " potatoes. The others were

Catholic/ evangelical /and, Hebrew
churches," which came to Petersburg to
nlead the cause of Poland, to make
known the attitude ; of that country to

the demands which ought to be ; immedi

quillity, issued a manifesto to-day to
the Russian people, "reviewing the sad

The assertions recently made in; a
Government communication .regarding
the cause which led to" the "declaration
of martial law in Poland are" categori
cally denied. It is insisted" that the
country is not in a state of revolution
and , that the acts of violence "which
formed, the pretext for the "imposition
of martial. law were not the acts. of the
Pollsh : people as a whole, but of the
same revolutionary elements /which
were' to be found throughout 'all Russia.
Count Kraszinsky, the leader; of the
delegation, who Is .. a grandson vof the
famous - Polish poet, . declared to-night
not only that the Polish parties, recog
nized that the restoration of Polish in
dependence was a dream impossible of
realization, but that! the "economic j fu
ture of the country was bound up with
that of .Russia, : and if 'given , autonomy
and freedom' from the dominion of Rus

FIREMEN OF NEVADA
HANDICAPPED BY ICE
Unable /to Subdue Flames
Because Water Freezes
in Pipes. ;
Special Dispatch to The Can.
RENO, Nov. 20.â A thawing water pipe
was the cause of a serious fire this aft
ernoon at Virginia City. During a fierce
blizzard which reigned in that city, the
water pipes in the Meacham residence
became frozen and the water supply of
the building was completely shut off. The
people of the house attempted to thaw
out the frozen pipes by the use of candles
and torches. The surrounding woodwork
became ignited } and in a moment the
house was a mass of flames. The Fire
Department attempted to combat the
flames with wet blankets, but the in
tense cold soon made the blankets a sheet
of ice and all- attempts to extinguish the
flames were futile. They were finally
compelled to cease their efforts and tho
building was completely destroyed by
the flames. By heroic work the firemen
succeeded in keeping the fire from spread
ing to any adjoining buildings.

which the President took exceptions.

BY MANSFIELD'S ART
Foremost Actor
Sheds Luster
on Play.
Presentation Is
an Honor to
Schiller.
Story of Prince
Unfolded bj-
Genius
In him "Don Carlos."* last night pro
duced at the ' Grand Opera-house for the
first time herÂ© by Richard Mansfield, the
actor honored equally Schiller, himself,
hla audience, and the cause of the high
est and best in dramatic art. Outside and
inside the theater looked like grand
operaâ outside, the flashing, plunging
lines of carriages; Inside, everybody that
uses them and the rest of us. There were
no shoulders, which looks . like a pity, but
eowns were frequent and lovely. The
house was Immense and the move from
the Columbia to the Grand Opera-house
evidently a most fortunate one.
Mansfield has again done the big thing,
the biggest of big things. In the big way.
Of him it Is expected that he shall hitch
his tragon to a star, and this now fore
most of the English-epeaking actors in
"Don Carlos" ha<T surpassed even the
highest expectations. The production is
the first in English of this noble Schiller
drama. The translation is by R. D.
Boy land, Esq.â the programme insists on
the "Esq."â the adaptation by Mansfield
himself, \rhich the programme curiously
omits. One hundred and eighteen years
ago the drama was first produced in
Hambourg. and last month for the first
time anywhere in English. Nothing short
of genius has gone to the adaptation.
Artist, Mr. Mansfield has seized the pic
ture with infallible judgment; poet, he
gives you the wonder-word that is the
life-blood of the play; dramatist, from
the ponderous movement of the original
drama he has made a clear-running and
incisive play of action that ranks with
the best of the classic repertoire. One
regrets the omission of some of the
scenes^ â that between Posa and Eliza
beth, that also between the King and
Posa, and that of the King's prayer, for
example, but it must be granted that
Mr. Mansfield's adaptation is throughout
singularly able, admirably sympathetic.
The necessities of the story involve a
somewhat "busy" act in act 3, but there
seems not a line too much, not a super
fluous moment. l
Piteous as Hamlet's and like Hamlet's
is this story of the Crown Prince of
Spain, loving, gentle, fine, weak of will,
despised of his father, in love with his
father's wife. One finds him at the court
of his father, Phillip 11, surrounded by
spies, helpless in an ever-closing web of
hatred and suspicion. "Not one can I
call my friend," says the poor young
Prince. This one learns in the first act,
in ihe Royal Gardens at Aranjuez. It is
here one learns of his lpve of his father
that has been swallowed up in fear. Here,
too. one learns of the unhappy young
man's passion for the woman whom his
father had married six years before.
And forward the drama moves. from this
on with the simplicity and inevitablenecs
of an old Greek tragedy.
Possibly there are roles better fitted to
Mr. Mansfield than**that of Don Carles,
but in the light "of last night's brilliant
performance it was not easy to remember
them. Possibly the most extraordinary
phase of the performance was the atmos
phere of youth Mr. Mansfield contrived
to create for the part. Twenty-three years
Don Carlos numbered, and not_ a day
moreâ even to the curtain bows^id the
actor appear to be. He" runs the gamut
of emotions in the part. There is a tre
mendous thrill in his accusing speech to
the king, over the body of his murdered
friend; "Murder is now the word!" and
the audience lost not a thread of it. But
Mr. Mansefild in his light, satiric, cynic
comedy with the Duke of Alva, in his
boyish colloquy with Posa. aye. and Mr.
Mansfield In the love scenes with Eliza
beth, is equally deiightful. His embarrass
ment with the Princess Eboli, who be
lieves Don Carlc^ in love with her, is
another charming bit. In all he is the
prince, distinguished, dignified, eminently
graceful, but It is the youth of the
portrait that is its most astonishing
phase.
Admirably 'In contrast is Fuller
Mellish's sinister figure of Philip, In
carnate cruelty, suspicion, determina
tion, and admirably Mr. Mellish fulfills
the demands of the role. ' He looks like
a Velasquez figure, and through all
the meanness and cruelty of the "king
yet contrives to picture the royal dig
nity of the 4 creature. . His facial ex
pression is encyclopedic, his gestures
as eloquent as Salassa's. Posa, -again,
is comfortably, if not yery distinctive
ly, played by A. G. Andrews, and Duke
Alva looks well, but counts lightly in
Leslie. Kenyon's hands.
The women include Miss Florence
Rockwell," a sweet and pleasing Eliza
beth; Miss Eleanor Barry ditto ditto as
the Princess Eboli, and Margaret Kil
roy, a clever page. This is not to for
gret Doming-o, capitally done by Clar
ence Hardyelde. \u25a0
The Bettings of the play are In the
best Mansfield manner,, quiet splendor
reigning- throughout. These are matched
by a beautiful selection of costumes.
But those desirous of enjoying Mr.
Mansfield in one of his happiest moods
will not fail to see "Don Carlos."
To-night is "The: Merchant of Ven
ice," "and the first time the actor has
ever appeared here in this or any
Shakespearean production.

Altogether, the house â while hardly,
a grand opera-house â was distinctly
smart. \
- Rarely have I seen prettier gowns; at
a mere dramaâ loads of square necks
with white throats showingâ and they
are pretty throats; typical of our olive
and orange clime.
Somehow, as at" our opera, bur towns
folk have not yet ; learned how, to , thaw"
out at a big night as was last night. They
freeze to their seats or 'boxesâ 'tis, un
necessary to mention I* refer to the fem
inine folkâ and wiggle their.' fingers v. at
friends elsewhere, and smile sickily, but
never would they venture .' between acts
a visit in their: friends' boxes. Distinctly

shaking up as they ran. into the turn

and its tracks lay at right angles with
the tracks upon which the approaching
car.was running.* The car was only go

STUDENTS TOLD
ABOUT BOYCOTT
Horace DaTis Addresses Uni
versity Men on Subject
of Trade With Orient
KELATIOXS WITH CHINA
Possibilities That Lie in
Commerce Are Described
by San Francisco Citizen
BERKELEY. Nov. â¢{>.â The boycott of
American-goods in China was declared
by Horace j Davis to-day. In . a lecture
on Oriental trade before the college of
commerce, to be a menace to American
Interests â¢ In, the Orient, creating a sit
uation so serious that the Chinese Gov
ernment' finds . itself powerless to con
trol it. - ,' '
\u25a0' :\u25a0'\u25a0\u25a0 Mr. Davis is a former, president of
the State University and now at the
head of the Sperry Flour Company of
California. His remarks regarding the
reality of the I boycott in Csina came
at the conclusion of a lecture: Intended
to show the greatness of the Oriental
trade, and Its sJgulnc&nce to. any coun
try that might snare in its division.
Speaking of the boycott, Mr. Davis
said:
I declare to r>u that Us* boycott of Ameri
can goods ' in Cfcica is effective, asd effective
now. Tbe Govermifiithas so-sat to check it.
bet flndE itself powerHse to ccniros"|he great
merchant \u25a0 guilds* of Shanghai aÂ»3 Ebneiors.

American made goods. \u25a0â¢ \u25a0
- While :t is true that ship* lea.viaÂ« these
Ehoresfor the Orient now carry rail cargoes.
dÂ» set thlsk' that the carjoe* are. for Caiaa.
Thty are mainly for Japan, srhtch cocntry is
rn^vjrt^ up tot- the lack oJ importation durisg
tn-s recent war. "Our commerce with China has
fallen o2 enormocsiy In the las* few month*.
The canae U found in the harsh administration
cf oar ejtelusion'law. The climax came when
a Urge nnniber of high-ciass Chinese, students
and others frcm China, were mistreated when
they came to au*n4 the St. tools fair. ; Forced
to - life- â¢ fcr week* in detention -'- sheds -with
coolies, eating coolie fare, they * returned to
China and -issased .the;Â«4iident guiids and
rzerehast gnllda \u25a0 with tales. t:as trje and
tana imaginary, about their treatraent' In
America. â¢-/. " ..\u25a0,":;;".
GUILDS ALL. POWERFUL.
C The guilds began, a propagan<-a . against the
oÂ»e of â¢ American, goods * and . the * result was
Â»ren at once. â¢ The guilds are ail powerful. 1
know of one : instance where , during the last
year the master of one rcoast "schooner was
Zzl*4 *3Â«X> "because be had violated the boycott
order, and he paid the fine, too." He had to or
<rait business There are seventy-two guilds
in Hongkong aione : that are behind the boy
cott. " The Chinese Government yardered X the
Vioeroy of Canton "to stop the Doycott. The
Viceroy- is tfl. ' anti-foreigner official, however.
ana he rsÂ«rety advlssd everybody to be | good.
He made no attempt to ' stop the propaganda.
What the oatcotne wiil be it is impossible U>
cay. bot one thing is certain â the Chinese Gov
ernment is not powerful enough to put a stop
.to. this -boycott -.of American goods. .
| Horace â¢ Davis gave the university
men a graphic description of the. part
tuat Oriental trade has played in mak
ing cities rich- Ancient and modern
Tyre, Babylon and AntiocTi were made
wealthy by it-. Always that trade has
been a bone of contention and Is to
day. The tide* by; which ltÂ»ls carried
has varied, and the .variations have re
sulted in , the rise or downfall' commer
cially of cities. ' ',
When the first _ voyage . was made
around the Cape of Good Hope it meant
the participation in the Oriental trade
of Trieste, Constantinople, Marseilles,
Venice and was. the foundation.of Lon
don's greatness. Steam I revolutionized
things in 1542, It's use m vessels giving
America its opportunity to take part
in the /pactolian stream, typified by
trade with the Orient.^
FUTURE POSSIBLES.
The speaker continued:.. \u25a0 :
Now we have overland : route* in America,
each commanding a steam^ilp line to .the
Orient, competing for this great Oriental trade,
and making it- possible to . send goods from
New York u> China on through bills of lading.
Now the opening of the. Panama canal must
b- figured on as a factor wtoee effect upon
Sur fortunes Â« so far a. \u25a0\u25a0*Â»'?*%Â£&**Â£ !i \
concerned. Will it alter, the conditions? _ I
think it " will â¢ come, but not ... much.^ It Â« will
lessen the distance between New York and
Chinese pone north of Hongkong. : but all ports
Â»outh of Hongkong will always ,use the Suer
route. The Panama canal : will help lie Gulf
Elates greatly, because it wUI shorten the dis
tance between their porta, from which_cotton
gees to Japan. Also * &in Francisco : will^ Ue
within 100 mCes ' of I the shorust .route which
steamers coming through the Panama canal
can take to the Orient.;- -L. .'
To appreciate- the importance of the Oriental
trade, let " me tell you ; that â¢ the { Chinese I now
have a foreign eommesce . amounting to about
SI 25 c head per ; year.. Japan baa in forty
years developed a commerce, .running up from
nothlagto about *5 50 per person, a year, cr
about Â«2ti0.000.0CÂ«0 per year \u25a0 altogether..- If
China can be made to develop such a trade
as this in the same time, it would amount to
about J2.M0.000.0W). >- Now ; China's . V. foreign
commerce ts J333.000.000. / .What ; this great
growth would mean to all the countries taking
part in supplying Chinas- needs, can: easily
be understood.' If China could. ever be made
to develop a foreign commerce â¢ equaling per
capita the commerce of this country it would
amount to the stupendoas total -of 113.000 000.
000 a year, an amount a mast Sncon-.elvabe.".
It 19 when these great possibilities are con
sidered that the - matter la â¢ seen in its proper
llghU and it la because of these possibilities
that such features | aB the; present boycott of
American goods -. in : China \ rightfully command
our serious thouf ht acd most sagacious action.

of disinclination to eat or ; to mingle
socially with his ordinary companions.

GOVEIIXMEXT HELP
FOE EOADS ASKED
Beport of Committee Named
by. Body Approved .-.by the
r Delegates Who Have Inter
ests of Far North at Heart
Special Dispatch to TbÂ« Call.
SEATTLE, Nov. 20.â The Alaska Ter
ritorial convention this afternoon adopted
unanimously the report of the resolution
committee on a memorial' to the people.
Congress and the President embodying a
fctateroent cf Alaska's needs and a re
spectful demand for recognition of her
rights. E"he preamble sets forth the con
\cntlon represents 60,000 Americans, and
outlines the conditions as they exist to
day, commercially, naturally and 'as fle
vc loped.
Those sections abolishing all powers of
attorney and limiting the locations on
any one vreek to two claims caused a
row in which it was stated on the floor
that such a law would make It impossible
for women to operate in the north, as
they could not go personally to the
claims .to locate. Mrs. John McKaught
replied* to this statement as follows:
"It has been said that women haven't
the- physical strength to go out in the
wilds of Alaska and stake claims. And
I say. speaking from years of experi
ence, that a woman who is not strong
enough, to go out in the public domains
and stake her own property has no busi
ness owning mines in Alaska."
This statement ended all discussion and [
* ihe section was adopted. The needs of
Alaska as set forth, in the memorial are:
fc First and foremost â A statute 'applyiD* to
.Maska eione. amendatory of and supple
mentary to the Federal etatute on mines and
mining making it Impossible to locate placer
mining claims by agent of attomey-ln-tact
â¢with cr u-itbont power of attorney or In any
manner to locate euch claims otherwise than In
person; makinc it imc>ossiblÂ« to locate mor*
than twenty ecres of placer mining ground In
one claim, thus abolishing: Utfc ground claim
cours*; making it impossible for any one pÂ«r
eon to locate more than two placer mining
claims on any one creek, or on any one of Its
tributaries: declaring that the bona Sde finding
tif ko\A in any Quantity whatever abywhere
within the boundaries of a placet- mining claim
constitutes discovery; substituting a cash as
sessment of 5^5 per annum on each placer min
ing claim for the annual labor assessment of
SIUO now required by law with the penalty that
failure to pay such cash assessment subjects
the claim to relocation, the moneys so paid to
be expended in the construction slid main
tenance of wagon roads and trails in Alaska;
and linaily. declaring the law cf water rights
In connection with iilacer mining claims. .
Second â A direct appropriation of $1.0C0.000
by Congress for the building of wagon roads
Â»nd trails under the eupervisicn of the Alaska
Road Commission.
Third â The application of the earning* of the
Government cat ie and . telegraph system In
Alaska U> the extension end betterment of the
cable and land lines and the wireless stations,
more particularly extensions of the cable f rom j
Kitka to Wrangt'l and Ketchikan, . and from
Seward to Illi-imna. Ihitch Harbor and Kaska.
Fourth â Legislation relieving United States
Ju<igâ¬3 in illaska of administrative duties and
the appointing of United States Conynission
crs. by transferring such" duties to the Gover
nor or ot*fcr civil officials.
Fifth â A redistrlcting of the present Judicial
divisions, an Increase in the number of Judges
and the creating of an appellate court In
Alaska. . * '
Sixth â The abolishing of the antiquated fee
system la all offices and the substitution or
adequate salaries. \
Seventhâ The removal of the restrictive^ tax
of $100 aÂ» mile on railroads in Alaska. ' \u25a0
Eighthâ The establishing of bases, lines and
meridians In tht vast and fertile valleys of"
i Southern and Central Alaska to the end that
| homesteaders now located and locating there
*i:i large numbers may occupy and Improve the
public domain of Alaska on terms of equality
â¢with homesteaders on the public domains else
where in tbe United States.
Ninth â The providing of more lighthouses on
the coasts of Alsiska, where a, fleet of Ameri
can steamships Is engaged In the merchant
marine exceedinc In numbers the American
fleet engaged in one field on any other ocean.
Tenth â Better postal tacllittes. with special
reference to assistance for postmasters .in rap
idly growing towns.
Eleventh â The erection of suitable buildings
for the transaction of public business in the
several divisions cf Alaska.
Twelfth â Tl> favor placing the care and
jirotectlcn of the natives of Alaska, und^- tbe
direct supervision of the Governor, In accord
affce with the recommendations of the Presi
dent in his annual me.Â«sa*e of 1904.
Senator . Piles addressed the conven
tion, stating he considered himself the
Senator . from Washington and Alaska,
â¢ and promised to do ail in his power for
the district along the line of harmonious
recommendations which he hoped to see.
He also spoke for Senator Ankeny. who
promised the same thing.
The convention adopted resolutions
promising" support "to the Alaska-Yukon
fair and giving thanks to the .Washing
ton â¢delegation for interest taken in the

Eumor Has It That a New
Line Proposes to Try to
Get Some of Up-Bay Travel
FERRY ACROSS STRAITS
East Shore and Suburban,
Running Out of Point Rich
mond, Planning Extension
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VALLEJO, Nov. 20.â Never in ,the
history of this section has there been
so much railroad talk as is now going
the rounds and, if half of the roads
talked of are constructed this sec
tion, which has , been fairly well
equipped with transportation facilities
in; the past, will be gridironed with
steel rails. The latest road coming to
Vallejo, according to. rumor, is* the
East Shore and Suburban, reaching
out- from Point Richmond. It is stated
that this line is quietly securing rights
of way from San Pablo to Vallejo
Junction and that a ferry will be put
on to cross the straits* to this", city.
That would give the road that now ex
tends from Berkeley and Oakland
through Richmond to San Pablo a
share of the big traffic between Val
lejo and Mare Island.
The offices of /the Vallejo. Benlcia
and Xapa Valley Railroad Company
have been transferred from Los An
geles to Napa. The Napa and Lake
port Railroad Company also has es
tablished offices in Napa.
â¢*It is given out that the work of
construction of the new line will start
on this line on March 1, 1906, and the
road will be completed In nine months.
Two parties, each containing fifty men,
are now employed in surveying the
route of the new road, one working
south from Lakeport, near Butts Can
yon, and the other near Rutherford.
It is stated that a third crew, running
a line from Napa to the bay, will be
put on this week.
Dr. George R. Harris will remove his offices
from 6 O'Farrell to rooms 106 and 10S. Phelan
building, about November 15. â¢

stone, died . October 16, -1900,*" and \ Gray
was named in her will as executor, theref
of, the /estate being : devised: to , Mrs.'
GraY arid her 'two children.*. In 'Febru
ary, 1903, , continues the * plaintiff,; the
property . was ', appraised I at * $45,000.;'. On
May; 22 : of the same year, Goldstone \ filed
his claim against ) the estate, ''and it was
allowed, he says, . but never, paid. "Upon

tinues" Goldstone,' it was shown" that' the
value of . the realty I was , only ! $34,000/ /- ;â¢Â«-Â»\u25a0â¢
This fact, he asserts, goes, to; establish

lowing allegations: ;? ;-y . :'-...
' \ln IS9S Marsaret E. Gray secured a '-. decree

lime Gray paid jlt&O back alimony/ and agreed
to pay thereafter a monthly; sum of ?75 to his

Invalid son, Harry W. Gray. *- .
Upon . the - flllne of . the. last : account of . the
executor some nineteen months -ago/ he' an
nounced to the court that his reasons for;fall
ing to pay the claim of Goldstone were thai
he was paying interest on a mortgage upon tha
property ;of the "; estate and that' Jhls and the
allowance to Mrs. Gray took' .all; of ;tha funds
of the estate.." '.'.'-'\u25a0{ N r '''".
V How it was that ' the court s did not dis
cover, at that time that J\lrs. r - Gray had
received no order for allowance \ from : the
estate, : Goldstone : does r not> , say, -\ but
nevertheless he asserts J that no ! such [or
der j was made, .but . that r.Gray has " paid
his : former 1 wife â¢ more than v $3000 out of

STILL FOR GRAFT.
THE organ of the municipal administration is "projecting war
tactics into the time of political peace that always follows an ex
citing campaign and an election. The people of San Francisco
have said their say, the majority has spoken and the minority takes
the verdict, American fashion, hopes for the best and goes about its
business. There wouM seem to be no further need to spill large type
and squander battle cry headlines over an event that is past. The
election cannot be won again, immediately, and speculations as to
what brought about the result, or what the effect will be upon the
political future sf the State, are waste of ink. .Even abuse of those
who had the misfortune to differ from the majority is unfruitful,
since in politics there must be'such differences, and people are not
to be clubbed into agreement nor kicked into unanimity.
Zeal in a campaign is good. It is evidence of sincerity, some
times, and is always the spice of a contest. Those who play the
game of politics in this country do it with energy. They often over
do it by foreseeing the general ruin, of the country if their side is
beaten, and they never see their prophecy come true. Some men
get so wrought up that after defeat they commit suicide,' the last
resort of a lunatic or a fool. It is not often; Jio we ver, that the winner
persists in chewing as large a rag as is being wallowed in the mouth
of the administration organ. The people who are aware 01 its evi
dent misery begin to marvel at it. Some think that it accumulated
more campaign ammunition than it used before the election, and is
now using it up firing salutes. It surely has a heat on and perspires
epithet and invective from every pore.
The victim of its wrath is Mr. Francis J. Heney, the noted pros
ecutor of the land grafters. It accuses him of a long line of offenses,
strung between homicide and changing his name. Inferentially Sec
retary of the Interior Hitchcock is a part of Mr. Heney's offenses,
with the President as a probable accomplice. Now all this is alleged
to be provoked by a speech made by Mr. Heney during the city
campaign, in which that gentleman declared his mind about matters
with considerable freedom. But others made speeches on the same
side, usiug equal freedom and perhaps more. Why should Mr.
Heney be picked out of the crowd for all this post-election blud
geoning?
If making a campaign speech is an /offense to be punished / by
large black type, there are others who should be among the prisoners
at the bar. But only Mr. Heney is arraigned, pulled into the dock,
metaphysically handcuffed and, with an Oregon boot on, compelled
to listen to the daily rereading of the indictment charging him with
denying the immaculate purity of the municipal administration. The
fact that he had the misfortune to differ from the majority, which
voted for the administration, instead of winning for him that com
miseration which even politicians feel for the fellow who guessed
wrong seems to add to the rancor and inspire the virulence with
which he is pursued.
Perhaps it is the force of habit. Mr. Heney has been entrusted
with the professional duty of prosecuting the land grafters in several
States. In the discharge of that duty he has laid the mighty low
and the proud hath he rebuked. The most powerful combinations
and most ingenious devices have been raised to obstruct him,- all in
vain. But his work is not finished. He is after more land grafters,
and as he goes for them the wrath of his_ victims pursues him. The"
organ of the municipal administration is the talking machine which
utters their fury. Mr. Heney is not attacked because he made a
campaign speech. The attempt is made to break him because he
is a distinguished prosecutor of land grafters. ,
It may occur to some people that this projecting of the cam
paign for graft and grafters far into political peace has for its mo
tive the desire to raise the siege against the pirates who have sailed
on the public domain, gaining much gear by their profitable freeboot
ing. No others have any interest in the undoing of Mr. Heney. The
attacks on him are in the interest of the numerous and widespread
"Order of Grafters," and all of them, fromihe low muckamuck to
the high, find music in the organ's roar.
THE BELATED RAIN.
THE extension of the dry season to an unusual length admon
ishes the people of California to economize the water supply for
irrigation. If this is done the agriculture of the State will riot
suffer from drought. By resorting to winter irrigation, which stores
water in the ground at the season of low evaporation, the supply that
is present will carry all of our leading crops over without loss.
Over a very large part of the irrigated area of the State artesian
wells are used. Numbers of such wells are flowing to waste. In
Fresno, Tulare, Kings and Kern counties this is especially the case.
These waste wells squander the ground waters of the artesian belt to
the injury of the wells whose waters are utilized in the irrigation of
crops. We have called attention to this waste before, and the pros
pect of a dry season makes it necessary to do so again. The law of
the State requires the capping of all such wells, and we believe it is
made the duty of the District Attorney in each county to enforce
this law. The Supreme Court of the State has decided that a land
owner may not lessen the pressure of water in his neighbor's wells,
except for the beneficial use of water from his own well on his own
land.
\u0084 .The law and this decision are intended to protect the ground
waters"of the State in their beneficial uses in irrigation, just as
various laws and decisions protect! the surface and flowing waters for
the same uses. It is a recognition of the necessity of irrigation from
these two sources. Upon such irrigation depend the food supply
and prosperity of the State. The conservation of surface and ground
waters is, therefore, one of the highest duties of public administra
tion. On the deserts, in the artesian belt, are some of the most fertile
lands in the State, needing only the water supplied by the artesian
wells. These lands produce fruit and forage crops in abundance, ami
add appreciably to the wealth and resources of the State. But their
fruitfulness is endangered by the waste of the ground water. from
flowing wells that were mistakenly bored on land* made barren ?by>
alkali or underlying hardpan. Such wells have caused great ponds of
stagnant water. The water has released the soluble salts in the
ground, and is too brackish for stock to drink. Thewaste has no
redeeming feature. This and the waste of flowing water should be
rigidly prevented. If this be done, California will feel but little- even
a prolonged drought.
It must not be forgotten by other parts of the State that our
raisin and much of our deciduous dried fruit output is produced en
tirely by surface and ground water irrigation, ilv parts of the -State
where the dry and hot atmosphere are necessary to the perfection of.
such crops, in conjunction with irrigation. Such being the -case it
is strange indeed that a prodigal waste of water should be anywhere
permitted.

voyage. President Roosevelt fired the boilers with one hand while /reaching
up his other hand into the air after 'wireless messages. â Chicago News.*

MIRROR OF DAME FASHION

THE vogue ; of the two-piece costume, coat and' Bkirt, still maintains, al
though the separate wrap hasencroached somewhat upon its "domain.;
The one illustrated shows its distinctively Parisian touches In ~ the , cut
and the manner that the trimming is "applied.:. The" coat is. of . three-quarter .
length, a comfortable one for winter wear; arid follows the; lines of the figure
closely, with the straight front line considerably emphasized. The . material |
is a satin-face broadcloth, of a* medium 'green in coloring, and the fronts
are thrown back in reveres and trimm.ed with black velvet ribbon -strap- I
pings, each strap held with a fancy button.- The sleeve is; a plain tailored!
"design, with just a trifle more of ; fullness f at ' the too than , usual ; with a
plain pattern; -while- the cuff is elaborated 'with strappings. The vest, with :
this season's characteristically, high collar, is of white satin, - cascaded all.:
down the front with, a creamy , lace jabot. The skirt is of extreme circular
cut, interlined with a princess haircloth for several inches above the hem, 1
falling in fluted folds to a full ten yards wide, at the hem.

The high-chair is the highest still.
Lolled in his office-chair, there sits
The master of a thousand mills;

Men failor prosper as, he, wills.
Perched on the polished bench, where
strife
Cries tocondemn or pleads to save,
Sits one, and blots the light from life,
Or. nods another to the grave.
Squat In'-jjis place of power, behold
The monarch of a mighty land!
And destinies are lightly tpld,"

DIVINE IS SHOWN HONOK
Dr. Matthew Is to Attend
General Conference of
the Southern M. E. Church
\u25a0 t*r. George C. Adams, pastor of the
Firet Congregational Church, spoke In an
optimistic mood before the Congrega
tional Ministers" Union yesterday morn
ir.g as to present conditions. He notes
that the influence of Christianity is visi
ble outside as well as within the church.
He sees au increase of sympathy and
Be!?-control, proving that there Is a leav
ening of the religious world everywhere.
This sympathy and self-control are be
ing shov.n in the city of Ban Francisco,
where the police force, he said, is Ineffi
cient and the administration not what It
should b*. With all these - drawbacks,
said the speaker, things are not so bad
as they ivculd have been In the past.
Dr. Adams was of the opinion that rep
resentative people not attached toÂ»or at
tending the church nevertheless ex
presed themselves In accora with the ef
forts cf the church.
The Rev. A. J. Hanson, D.D.. of San
Leandro spoke before the Methodist Min
isters' meeting yesterday* at Central

vfvaJ." He held that the true revival Is
the direct result of the outpouring of the
holy spirit on a community in answer to
the earnest, persistent prayer of any
number of God's consecrated children.
Dr. Hanson laid emphasis, first, on the
manner of preaching the word of God;
eecond, the honoring of their profession
as ministers and Christians by right liv
ing in the discharge of their- ministerial
duties, and third, honoring the spirit of
God in their prayers.

ALLEGES LAWYER
HAS FALSE DEED
Mrs. H. A. Looinis Files Peti
tion Charging Fraud by
Attorney JL E. Eagland
FIGHT FOR AN ESTATE
Property Is Old Homestead
Over Which There Has
Been Much Litigation
Mrs. Hannah Ann Loomis, an aged
widow living at 2738 Bryant street, yes
terday filed a petition and affidavits in
the office of the County Clerk in which
she alleges that' if her former attorney,
R. E. Ragland, has a deed to her home
stead in his possession, he obtained her
signature to the paper either by forgery
or by Inducing her to sign under false
pretenses. The petition is a reauest to
be allowed a change of attorney in a suit
against E. H. Loomis, her brother-in-law,
to set aside a trust. In this case she
joins Attorney T3. A. Brldgford, who was
associated with Ragland In the case.
She swears " that any representations by
Ragland that she either sold or conveyed
her preperty to him are false and that
neither Ragland nor Bridgford have ever
had any interest in it. She asks that M.
Casey be appointed her attorney.
R. E. Ragland, who is now cashier of
the Citizens' State Bank, claims that he
was deeded the property by Mrs.' Loomis
in return for attorney's fees due. He
says that she deeded over the property
to him in time of litigation, when her
rights were in question, and that after
ward a decision of the Supreme Court
made her transfer legal. He says that
she was to have been taken care of for
her life and that at her death the prop
erty should pass to him and that when
he accepted the property it was of little
value, but that Is has since appreciated.
It is now worth about $7000. '
STORY OF SUITS.
The history of the Loomis estate has
been one of almost ceaseless litigation.
When Barney Loomis died a few years
ago he told his wife on his deathbed that
she should have the property, but that
she should see that it went to his brother,
E. H. Loomis, at her death. She prom
ised faithfully to obey instructions and
after her husband's death she wrote to
E. H. Loomis and told him of the com
pact. There was a mortgage on the prop
erty and many debts t,o be paid. A
nephew of E. H. Loomis' came out from
lowa and advanced money to pay the
necessary bills _ and these two, with a
neighbor, Mrs. Mary Hawley, appeared
before Attorney Joseph Hutchinson, who
drew up a trust, appointing Mrs. Hawley
trustee and manager of the property,
Mrs. Loomis to live on It and reap the
benefits during: her life and the whole to
pass at her death to E. H. Loomis.
After a little time Mrs. Loomis be
came dissatisfied at the way the prop
erty was managed by Mrs. Hawley and
werit to R. E. Ra&land, who acted as
her attorney in a suit to have the trust
broken. This was done by a decision
made in the Fair case after the trust was
drawn up. but the court held that there
was another trust because of the letter
written 6oon after Barney Loomis 1 death,
in which she repeated her promise to her
husband. The Suyreme Court later re
versed this decision because the property
was' '-a homestead and handed the case
back for a new trial. This is the condi
tion of affairs to-day and it is in this
suit that Mrs. Loomis has joined the at
torneys. ' X ~
SEES REPORT IX PAPER.
In the meantime, she alleges, she was
surprised on October 17 by her neighbor,
Mrs. Catherine Felvey, approaching her
and saying, "I see that you have sold
your property." A hurried look at a daily
paper showed that R. E. Ragland had
recorded the deed. In astonishment Mrs.
Loomis hurried to Ragland's office and
asked for an explanation.. He said that
he held the deed, that she had signed it,
and when she burst into tears, according
to the affidavit of Mrs. Felvey. told her
she "might as well go home and get over
it, for the deed Is going to stay."
The deed was dated . January 25," 1902.
It was acknowledged before J. L. Jacobl.
While Jacobl will not Bwear that Mrs.
Loomis was there and signed the deed,
yet he eaid yesterday that he was sure
that she appeared before him. His rec
ords show the date of the acknowledg
ment. \u25a0 \u25a0
Now Mrs. Loomis has deeded the prop
erty to E. H. Loomis and has taken a
life Interest in It. She will fight the al
leged rights of Ragland.

DENOTED MARINER SIGNALS

Sailor Is Despoiled
of His Clothes
by Burglar.

Clad in a ralnbarrel, which he had
taken from j the roof, Alexander Horgan
of the good ship rAberdeen stood on the
balcony of 22 East street waving dis
tress signals with : an undershirt at
tached to a walking-stick. The afore
said garment was all that, was, left of
an extensive wardrobe formerly owned
by the- mariner. * _/.., ,-'..,...
The chill north wind whistled
through the 'whiskers ;of : the "sailor,
moaning plaintively -as It tossed them
about. The breeze nipped at his tarry
toes, it bit at his carmine hose, and his
teeth chattered. * â¢
â¢ "Ahoy!" he shouted. "Heave a line.
They looted my slop chest. Lay to,
somebody, and heave me a blanket.
I'm marooned on a blasted pirate's Isl
and. Ship me a pair sof . trousers for
the love of heaven." .. i
But the crowd .that cruised -along
East street was not sympathetic. The
breezes bit. deeper into the unprotected
hide of the mariner and. he began to
turn purple.
Suddenly he bethought himself of the
telephone in his room. He seized the
receiver. "Give me ] the Admiral of
Police," he shouted. \
"Nickel, please," demanded the girl.
"I would If I had one, lass," he
pleaded. . "But I'm marooned and a
crowd of land sharks have, shanghaied
my slop chest. Give me the Admiral."
"Nickel, please," repeated the .In
exorable voice. \u0084 â¢
"Lass," pleaded the.. mariner. "I'm

and some sails." : ,;
Two detective* were sent out from
the Hall of . Justice. :, No clothes could
be obtained, so, clad in his wooden
garment, Horgan t was rolled down the
stairway and loaded- into the patrol
wagon. His modesty caused him to
shrink into the firkin, and. the crowds
that , gathered were unable to see the
contents.
Most of the multitude still clung to
the delusion that the policemen were
burglarizing^ the: lodging-house. .At

some garments. , ,; I
Horgan tells a doleful tale. He hired
a room at 22 East street Sunday night.
When he awoke yesterday morning his
purse and his entire wardrobe, with the

shirt would have been taken if he had

DUFFEY LOSES
GOOD STANDING
â¢Amateur Athletic Union Dis
covers Famous Sprinter
Received Expense 3loney
BARRED OUT FOREVER
Trio of San Francisco Men
Are Placed on Governing
Board of the Great Body
NEW YORK. Xov. 20.â A1l QiÂ© sprinting
record* of Arthur Duffey were declared
void by the Amateur Athletic Union of
the United States at Its meeting to-day.
President Joseph MacCabee, in presenting
his annual report, said in part:
"The man who deliberately accepts ex
cessive expense money is a professional
of the worst type and the eeal of amateur
condemnation should be placed upon him
forever. In the case of Duffey It is rec
ommended that ail mention of him be
expunged from the records of the Ama
teur Athletic Union, commencing from
the day when he admits he received ex
cessive expense money. It is also recom
mended that further legislation be enacted
to the end that the paying of expense
money be regulated in a more systematic
ihanner, and if possible that a limit to
such payments by clubs be established.
"Another evil which demands immedi
ate attention is the training and the so
called training rendezvous. Criticism has
also been made of certain organizations
because of the holding of professional
and amateur games at the* same meet.
The advisability of discontinuing this
practice is submitted with the urgent re
quest for action which will eliminate the
evils, if evils there be incident to such
conditions."
The new board of governors elected in
cludes: Pacific Association. W. G. Har
rison, 11. L. Rosenneld and N. A. Wood
son, San Francisco. A resolution was
adopted annexing the James Bay Asso
ciation, Brocton Point Association and
all other British Columbia athletic clubs.
Walter Eckersall, quarterback of the
Chicago University football team, who
was suspended on the charge of having
played professional baseball on the
fipaldlng team of Chicago last summer,
asked reinstatement from the national
body on the ground that he had played
purely for recreation and exercise, and
was allowed only his expenses. The
board allowed him to be reinstated, but
moved that he be warned against repeat
ing the offense.
President Joseph MacCabee of East
Boston was elected president and William
Greer Harrison of San Francisco was
chosen a vice president. James E. Sulli
van of New York City was elected Sec
retary-treasurer. â¢;i V,

FORM PLAYERS HIT HARD ONCE MORE
SULLIVAN WILL
HAVE HARD JOB
Gardner Sure to Give Twin
a Brisk Argument When
They Meet Friday - Night
BOTH IN GOOD SHAPE
Local Sports Like Lowell
Boxer and He Probably
Will Be Strong Favorite
Mike (Twin) Sullivan, the gritty
Irish lad, will undertake the hardest
job of his fighting career when he
steps into the ring with Jimmy Gard
ner at Woodward's Pavilion Friday
night. Sullivan has boxed two I draws
with Gardner back in Massachusetts,
and he has aiso defeated Jack Black
burn, who in turn defeated Gardner,
yet his contest Friday night is looked
upon as even harder than any . of his
i previous ring engagements. Sullivan
has devoted the past several years to
training all the '28, '30 and '33 pounders,
and the past year or two to whipping
the best '35-pound men in the country,
and now he is to meet Gardner at
catch weights and to many the contest
is believed to carry the welter-weight
title.
So great Is the confidence of those
who bet on boxing matches In Gardner
to lick almost any one in the .world at
his weight that it is thought he will
sell a strong favorite over Sullivan be
fore the men start for the ring. It is
hardly the fighting form of the men
that is making, or will make, this
price, but it is simply because Jimmy
has been seen in a local ring on two
different occasions, and they believe
he is invincible. It is strange coinci
dence that four out of every five short
enders win In local rings, and who can
tell the long shot on this occasion may
cross the wire ahead.
From the time Referee Jack Welch
calls the men to the center of the ring
people are expecting to see a great bat
tle. The aggressiveness that Gardner
is known to employ in the ring and the
old-time cleverness Sullivan is pos
sessed of should result in some good
sport.
Morris Levy reports fan extremely
large demand for seats. The advance j

MANY FAST PLAYERS
IN ACADEMIC LEAGUE
All Star Team Picked From
. the Rival High School
Elevens.
The Academic Athletic League tro
phy, which has rested in the hands of
the Lick School students for the past
year, will now go Dack to the Berke
ley High School after an absence of
twelvemonths. -;-' V,
By defeating the Lowell. High School
â¢at football last Saturday, the Berkeley
lads are credited with the cup, making
two out of the last three years that
this school has annexed the champion
ship. If Berkeley can turn the trick
once more in the next two years the
cup can rest in the school for keeps.
The exact men who would make up
an all-academic team this year would
be hard to pick, as most of the play
ers, particularly the guards and halves,
have all played about on a par. With
out doubt Barkan of Lowell deserves
first consideration as an end, with
Jackson of Alameda a ; good second,
uieb of Lick also looms up strong. Al
though it was his first season in high
school company, the record he made for
himself perfectly justifies his being
classed with tbe'cop-notchers. " . -
Undoubtedly the best tackle would
be Main, Lick's captain, with Al Sollns
ky of Berkeley a good second. Where
guards are concerned all the schools
had average men for these positions.
But the best pair .would probably be
Boxton and McNeil of Lick. Doane of
Berkeley would make the star center
of the league.
The position that seems to have the
best men on all the teams is that ot
quarterback. The way in which Miller
of Berkeley ran his \u25a0 team and handled
punts in the tack field would place him
first among the quarters. Roncovierl
of Lowell, "Sara" Hall of Lick and
Saunders of Polytechnic are the cracks
that are left, each being about as good
as the, other, although Roncovieri and
Hall are more valued men to have in
the back field than Saunders.
For the halfback positions Garibaldi
ot "Poly" ' would ' probably come first,
were it not for the fact he was profes
sionalized. Giberson of Lowell - and
Merrltt* of Berkeley would have the
next call for the job. \u0084
Peck ranks first among the fullbacks,
with Edwards of Polytechnic and To
xnosini of Palo Alt<v substitutes.

The massacre of favorites was made
complete at Oakland- track yesterday,
when Celeres,- a 9to 20 chance, . finished
third in the concluding seven I furlong
purse event Previous to "thlÃ, ""'.horses
quoted at all ! sorts of fancy prices had
been tramping, home -in front and those
who usually string .;: with \u25a0< the public
choices unloaded on Celeres.' The ; three
year-old, while looking fit, is apparently
far from being at his best. Knapp kept
him in front almost to \u25a0 the paddock,
where he save it up. , . . . ' \
Then Cholk Hedrick. a 40 to 1 shot, dis
posed of Albert Fir, the second choice,
In a hard drive. If the bookmakers had
accepted all of the wagers offered them
they could have cleaned up a -fortune. >
A fierce northerly wind swept the
course, making it â¢ disagreeable for both
horses and riders. - The attendance â¢ was
large.
A very ordinary lot of sprinters started
in the opening scramble, and there were
tips enough in circulation to keep a per
son broke the balance of his natural life.
For some unexplainable , reason 7 E. " C.
Runte, the cheapest sort of a plater, was
installed favorite. He finished â¢ fifth.
The winner turned up in Dr. Sherman,
which Davis landed an easy first ' over
Metlakatla. Instrument, a 10 to 1 chance,
ran third.
James Nealoh's Royal Rogue was far
and away the best of the ten starters
in the Futurity course \u25a0 selling ' : run,
which followed, but he lost; to Sir
Preston, a 30 to 1 shot. ; Royal Rogue
closed an even' money chance, and
Wright had orders to rate the chest
nut until the stretch , was reached.
Wright . waited too/ long, " for, at : the
wire, the long shot beat his mount a
neck. Old Matt Hogan finished third,
at 15 to 1. Cousin Carrie," though well
supported by stable money, lacked
speed." j
I'm Joe, at 9. to 10, was the third fa
vorite to take the count. ,The little
fellow could not negotiate the six
furlongs, falling easy prey to Comilfo,"
a 6 to ,1 shot from Jack Keene's barn.
Barney Schreiber's Nealon secured
shew honors.
Next came the disastrous defeat of
Watercure, the 4 to^ 5 favorite | for the
mile and a sixteenth! selling number, by
Dlvlna." The first choice, .might have'
scored If ridden with/ better, judgment
by W. Smith. . Entering the stretch
Smith swung very "wide with .his
mount, permitting of. McÃrlde on Di
vina saving an acre of ground. .This
told at the -..end, .for , the.El Priinero
stable's mare led the favorite out near
ly a length. Akela >an third, a head
in advance of Christine A.
Cloche * dOr, favorite r> for jj the [ mile
selling affair, looked one hour the best,
but she got beaten." Cr6sswalte ; man
aged to get cut off early,; at one stage
bringing up'at the tail end of the.pro
cession with the Coffey entry, which
was played down to 8 to -5 favoritism.
He then threaded his way- through the
field, and only dropping the: verdict to
Sherry by a neck. The;; winner had
Loague in 'the saddle and was backed
from 20 down to 6. Tramway, the
mount of . Reed, ran' lnto the show; .

GREGGAINS LOSES OUT
Mechanics' Pavilion .-! Will
Once More Be Scene of
Some Lively Engagements
, The : Tosemlte- Club is, in the "field

Goffroth and : Eddie ;Qra^ney will do
business at' the same old stand and
the : sports 'will v gather Vat ,' Mechanics'
Pavilion,-, the* place -that Â» has 'not seen
a prizefight : since I the Supervisors put
Coffroth out -of the running' many
months ago. â¢
i Coffroth and Graney;. achieved their
triumph ' yesterday afternoon when the
Board * of ; Supervisors granted them a
permit -to . pull 1 - off a V boxing â contest
during the month of December. It
did. not even go; to a vote, because the
honest little -horseshoer managed to
make the , rounds and get the signature
of ten of the Supervisors to his petition
praying for the -permit. Everything
went along lovely, and Graney left the
place swelled up like a hot biscuit
after "wiring to Coffroth that the
Yosemite Club was a live one again.
-'"It has been known for some time that
the Yosemite Club would land the palm
this time, but ; still there was some
doubt, for Alex Greggains was hot af
ter the permit for the San Francisco
Club. ~ Alex thought he would bring
It home, too, and was making a hard
fight .'to get the paper till he saw his
chances had fled. However, he was on
hand at the Supervisors' meeting yes
terday, but could do" no good.
-Shortly before he , lost his standing
with the Supervisors Jimmy Coffroth
paid hla license of 91200 for the fight
privileges for a year. This money was
never refunded to him, though he only
pulled off one fight after paying it into
the -city treasury. He is entitled to
two more after this one before he has
to dig down in his Jeans again.
Now that the Yosemite Club has se
cured: the piece of paper, it is an as
sured fact that the . Fitzsimmons-
O'Brien go will be pulled off in this
city, on December 15. Had Coffroth
lost out he would have been forced to
go back to Colma again, and he was
already getting \u25a0 ready to take to' the
woods in case the Supervisors turned
him down. '
â¢ The Supervisors also granted a per
mit to : the Hawthorne Athletic Club to
hold lan amateur boxing - exhibition on
the evening of Friday, December 8. A
similar permit was granted . the Occi
dental Club ' for November 28.

William : White. \u25a0 prof essor of Bursary
at "the "University, of Pennsylvania and
a member ; of the university committee.
on . athletics," returned to-night from
Washington, where he had been sum
moned by President Roosevelt to dis
cuss matters relating to f ootbalL In
an Interview to-nlgat Dr. White said:
"The President did me the honor of
asking* me to lunch! with him "at the
vv tiite House to-day for the purpose* of
discussing with him the situation as
to American football. An article of
mine published. in last" week's Outlook
wa3 the occasion of the invitation. As
to' "what took place during: my visit,
the President has .permitted me to say
that we are in complete accord as to
the need of permanent abolishment of
brutality and foul play; of the increase
of the powers of the officials and of
the severity of the penalties as neoea
sary to bring about such abolition;
as to the desirability of careful â¢ con
sideration of any changes 'in 'the rules
that may be. required to minimize dan
ger while preserving the essential,
manly and vigorous characteristics of
the game and as to the urgent need
of earnest effort to secure a simple
and uniform eligibility code for all
American colleges ; and universities.
The President said he 'emphatically be
lieves in continuing the game.'
"! **The President added: 'Brutality and
foul play should receive the same sum
mary, punishment given to a man who
cheats at cards, who strikes a foul
blow in boxing. The umpire must have
the widest .latitude In enforcing this
principle, even to the extent of order
ing not only individual, players, but
whole teams . off the field and college
presidents should hold to the sharpest
accountability the umpire who permits
foul or brutal football in any game. _.
" 'We want simple . rules, not com
plicated rules, because complicated
rules offer too many loopholes. Tha
responsible. authorities of the several
colleges whose teams ' play together
should have what may be called a gen
tlemen's agreement among- themselves
that these rules shall be enforced in
spirit as well as in letter, each being
held responsible for what goes on in
hla own college and each seeing to
the permanent removal from the same
not only of . the foul or brutal player,
but of the man who is not a bona fide
student and amateur." It would be - a
real misfortune to lose so manly and
vigorous a game as football and to
avert such a possibility the college
authorities in each college should see
to it that the game In that college 13
clean.' ** â¢*
"He spoke more than once of the de
sirability of continuing the frame and
of extending to as many as possible
iÂ£s advantages with the safeguard al
ready mentioned. 'He said that the
live or six leading colleges should get
together and agree to play one another
under such an agreement as he pre

greater relative danger of many other

JOHN AND WINTHROP ARRIVES FROM" THE FAR NORTH
Broadway Wharf Is
Threatened by
Fire.
Waters of Harbor
Swept , by a
Norther
The vrhaJlng bark John and Winthrop,
Captain W. T. Shorey, which left here
January 18 last, returned yesterday from
a â¢whaling cruise with 3000 pounds of bone
and 230 barrels of oil. This means profit
for the owners, fair pay lor the skipper
and some of the officers and Jl for the
preen hands. Among tbose who earned
tl for ten months* hard work on the John
and Winthrop. is E. M. Llvernash,
brother of former Congressman Liver
rash.
It Is feared by those on the John and
Winthrop that -some harm may have
befallen the schooner Gotama. She was
epoken September 29 and then had four
whales. She was In sight October 3.
when a terrific gale swept her out of
sight. For eleven days the John and
Winthrop fourrht for her life. When the
weather cleared, there was no Gotama
and the schooner was not sighted again.
The John and Winthrop was nearly driv
en ashore In Shanter Bay a few weeks
earlier in a storm almost as severe as
the later one. She dragged two anchors
and only when a third mudhook was
dropped, was the grip on the ocean floor
strong enough to overcome the rush "of
wind and wave.
Harry Shelton and Joseph Ready, mem
bers of the crew, enlivened a few hours
of the long voj-age by engaging In a
<3ueL Shelton carved a ptrip of flesh from
Ready's Jaw and before Ready could re
taliate with the harpoon he had grabbed,
Captain Shorey called it a draw and put
both men in irons. Two days on bread
and water cooled their ardor and when
the belligerents were turned loose, they
showed no Inclination to resume hostil
ities.
. George Allen, another member of the
crew, fell overboard, but was promptly
rescued.
The Gotama, if she escaped the storm
in which she was struggling when last
seen by the John and Winthrop, should
be here this week and that will be about
all of the whaling fleet until the ice
Fives up the vessels Imprisoned In the
Tar North.
Fire on Broad war Wharf.
What tnlg-ht have been a. very serious fire
w&f discovered yesterday afternoon on Broad
m-ay wharf No. 2. occupied by the Pacific
Coast" FU-amsiiip Company. San FraneSseo is
one of the few big ports in the world wheni
the wharves are constructed of wood and is
about tha oal> port In the world where smok
ing is permitted Indiscriminately pn and
about the docks. Somebody dropped a lighted
clear or tigarette on Broadway wharf. It
dropped between two flanks and set ftre to the
loose rubbish accumulated there. When dis
covered the fire had covered a wide space un
derneath the wharf and the stiff northerly wind
had fanned It Into alarming proportions before
thÂ« firemen were able to reach it. The City
Fire Department turned out with Its usual
r-rorapwess. but it wan nearly an hour aftfir
the <.:.':rm had s:j-j:.Â«< C before the State fire
tups pat in an appearance. :Xo freight was
ilimacK) by the fire and the cost of repairing
the wharf will not be great.
Nortber Mir* Up Harbor.
A lively norther swept the waters of the
harbor yesterday afternoca and the ferry boats
trot the first tumbling about they have had
in many months. The bteam schooner Signal,
the State Dlle driver and the quarantine
steamer NcÂ»tune had to be moved from the
reawall to less exposed positions. Vessels an
chored m the t*ay let go additional anchors and
In the tug boat of aces, extra lookouts will be
maintained until the weather moderates.
The steamer Edith, which arrived yesterday
from the north, had a regular submarine *oc
pt-rtence coming down the coast in the teeth of
a stiff southeaster. Captain Crdskey reports
that his vessel was under water during the
entire passage.
The fcuslc M. Plummer, coming in from sea
over the breaking bar. shipped a big sea which
ewept one of her boats from the davit*. The
boat was not damaeed and later was recov
ered. â y,.
Abandoned Off Cape Horn.
\Tord was received from London yesterday
of the abandonment of the British ship Gars
dale last September off Cape Horn. The ves
sel was dismasted and helpless and the crew
*rw taker, off by a homeward bound vessel.
Â»hlch Janded them at Greenock. Th* Gars
dale, which was bound from Shields for Ore
gon, was well known at this port. She was
built at BeUurt in IKSS and was a vessel of
1775 tons register. She was owned in Liver

COMPANY ASKS
FOR A HEARING
Home Telephone Corporation
Urges Supervisors to Pass
on Petition for Franchise
MEETING TO BE CALLED
Ordinance Providing for "the
Lease of City Lots to the
Highest Bidder Is Adopted
William Thomas, attorney for the
Home Telephone." Company, appeared
yesterday before the Supervisors' Utili
ties Committee and urged that the pe
tition !of the corporation for an inde
pendent telephone', franchise be r taken
up at an \ early date. Thomas | said j his
client ; : was entitled- to have a report
made ;by,s the : committee, , the \ petition
having been, filed on June 12 last. Su
pervisor | Box ton stated that* the matter
had ; been put over at > the request /of
the .company itself, \ and the sickness of
Chairman Braunhart had further de
layed the hearing. .D'Ancona Said the
hearing would certainly be granted, but
the company could have the privilege
of submitting! .briefs regarding : its
claims for a franchise. Thomas said
he would like to present . verbal argu
ments also.i which would not take long.
- "We ' took up your time at former
hearings," said Thomas, j "by reading a
lot -;of stupid letters, which did not
seenvtohelp our case any, but we will
not: make that' mistake again."
It was decided . to communicate with
Braunhart. to fix a date for the hearing,
and if he is too ill to take part in' the
proceedings . a meeting, will be called
without him. . . , â¢
Tho Mayor was authorized to sell at
public auction, ten horses unfit for fur
ther use In I the j Fire Department.
The Ordinance ordering the repay
ing \u25a0 and widening .of . Fourth . street
between Howard and Townsend at a
cost of : $5Q,000 was finally passed.
Similar action was taken, on the or
dlnancoc authorizing the lease of the
Market Place arid Produce Exchange
| lots to the highest bidder. The South
: tern Pacific; Company desires to lease
the lots for terminals In connection
! with its bay shore cut-off road. v
The board adopted a resolution, di
recting tho City. Attorney not to prose
cute an: appeal- in the suit of former
Surveyor Charles S* Tllton, .who dur
ing his lifetime secured a judgment for
$13,500 against the city for surveying
work done while in office. The original
face value 'of the claim amounted to
$8500, exclusive:- of interest, and the
Finance Committeo effected a compro
mise on that basis with Tilton's heirs,
and the claim will" be paid out of the
surplus fund. . ;': ' ' ._ .
\u0084" The claim of Policeman J. 1 J. Dow
of $50 as reward for the; arrest and
conviction of '.W. â¢ J. Laymance . for' in
juring birds In Golden , Gato Park was
denied on the advice of the City At
torney that a policeman is not entitled
to any extra compensation other, than
that provided' in the. charter.

desirable ' suburb. It has as good a climate as
can be found anywhere in the world. Land is

ital expended", for -the- past : 25 years. ; This

GOLD OUTPUT

Entire Yield of Magnesite

Out in This Section
WASHINOTOX. Nov. 20.-A report U
sued by the Geological Survey says that
the production of gold In the United
States durins 1904 amounted to 3,910.72)
fine ounces, valued at $80,635,646. This
represents an increase of $7,423,943 over
the production of 1903. The largest pre
vious output, which was in 1902. amounted
to $80,000,000.
The production of silver in 1904 amounted
to 55.999.5frJ fine ounces,, valued at
$32,035,378. This represents an increase of
1.639,861 ounces over the production of
1903 and an increase in value of $2,713,373.
The record output of silver in 1592.
amounting to 63,500.000 fine ounces, the re
port says, has not been reached in lata
years, nor has the commercial value at
tained the figures of that year, which,
amounted to $52,101.000.
The principal sources of the increase of
the gold production compared with that
of 1903, the report says, are easily trace
able. . Colorado added; nearly $2,000,000 to
her production of 1903, most of this
amount coming from the mines of Crippl*
Creek. Nevada's output increased about
the same amount, chiefly by reason of
the phenomenal yields of the Goldfleld
mines. â¢ Greater progress Is reported in
California, whose production exceeds that
of 1903 by $2,800,000, the Increase being
due partly to a strong development of
the quartz mining industry and to the
activity of the dredgers. jjggjÂ§
Alaska and Arizona show increased
yields, amounting respectively to $475,893
and J745.705. A number of Statea show
smaller increases, while Utah. Montana
and 'Washington have less gold to their
credit In 1904 than in 1903.
The increase of value in the production
of silver of $2,713,378 is somewhat evtnly
distributed among the various States and
Territories, but is to some extent due to
the better price of silver obtained. Col
orado leads w,ith an increase of $970,320.
California, . Idaho, Montana, Xevada, and
Utah also added considerable value to
their stiver production.
California is the only State, according
to the report, that produces magneslte,
which is a native magnesium carbonate
composed of 47.6 per cent magnesia and
52.4 per cent carbon dl-oxide. During
1904 the quantity of crude magnesite pro
duced was 2550 tons, valued at $9293. For
ISO 3 the quantity reported was 3744 short
tons crude valued at $10,595. equivalent
to 1361 tons calcined, worth $20,513. The
demand for both crude, and calcined mag
nesite on the Pacific Coast is limited and
prohibitive freight rates have thus far
prevented shipments to the East. Ore
gon and California consume the entire
native production. Other States. are de
pendent on imported magnesite.
THEY. SUE TO ESTABLISH
IXTEItEST IX THE ALCAZ.VR
Children of ' the Late â¢ .Mark Thall De
mand Accounting of Profit*
or\Theater.
Charles M. Thall and Ella A. Thall
Risbrough, children of the late Mark
Thall. filed suit yesterday against Mau
rice E. Mayer and Frederick Belasco
for an accountins of the pronta of the
Alcazar Theater, In which, they allege,
they have just discovered their father
held a partnership interest at the time
of his death. , .
Plaintiffs- assert that after their
father's death they instituted an in
vestigation to establish his interest In
the Alcazar, but upon being assured, by
Mayer and Belasco that his Interest
expired with his death and upon their
promise that they would give the
plaintiff, Charles, a steady position
and the plaintiff. Mrs. Rlsbrough. *40
a month, they abandoned the investi
gation. HHBBHBfI&KBHHI
Charles. - they say. was given a posi
tion, and the payment was made regu
larly to" Mrs. Risbrough until Thall's
estate was finally settled. Then, say
the plaintiffs, Charles was discharged
from his position and the payment to
Mrs. Risbrough was stopped. Since
then, say the plaintiffs, they have in
vestigated , the affairs of thÂ© Alcazar
, and have -discovered that at the : time
of their father's death . he was an ac
tual partner and that his interest was
worth $20,000. . â
Hence they, pray that the
;be compelled .to account to them
and that pending the settlement of the
partnership affairs a receiver bo placed
in charge of the theater. Tha plain

"It is particularly noticeable that Europe
now holds about 3.000,000 bags less Brazil cof
fee than two years ago, and when we consider
that her consumption of Brazils is 5.750,000

that Burop* will yet have to buy millions of

Violent movements in individual (stocks . not

to be a characteristic of the market. Tbe

Het tAt no time thi* season has the market

faiorlu* had their place in the leadership. of
the market, but there was substantial show
ing of standard railroad and Industrial stocks
added to the movement. The renewed strength
in the Pacifies was of notable effect on senti
ment. Southern Railroad stocks continued
prominent, apparently la sympathy with . the
â¢xtaordinary movement ta the Southern steel
. industrials The inciting factor In the latter
group was the discussion of a probable merger.
Other iron and ste*l stocks moved In sympa
thy, but the United States Steel' stocks proved
notably laggard. American Smelting continued
readily responsive to the operation.! which ;
rushed It up to a new record price. OthÂ«r I
metal and 6melting stocks were helped by this
and by the increased dividend declared by the
Calumet and Hecla Company. Tim speculation
in Reading was also actively pushed, although
that stock failed to reach its highest record
price, and Brooklyn Transit was an active
I feature. The special features in the specula
â¢ tion will account for gains running all the way
from 2% to over 11 points. Money rates
worked easier and this was the prime stimu
lating factor in the srpeculatlon. The more, re

twelve and fifteen miles per hour In cer
tain designated districts, with no limit

more than eighteen tons to be
equipped with both air and hand brakes.
Supervisor Lunstedt suggested that an
ordinance be framed regulating the size
of the street cars, as well as their speed.
eayir.g that the entrances to some of thr
ear* are so low that some people are hurt
In going through them.
The proposed resolution awarding the
contract for printing Civic Architect D.
H. Burnham's report for the adornment
ct San Francisco to H. S. Crocker Com
pany at JIS3I for 1000 books and 529S for
additional lots of 500 books was deferred
\u2666ne week. The Printing Committee, in a
report, states that the Commercial Pub
lishing Company was the lowest bidder,
but it recommends that the bid be re
jected en the ground that the public in
terest will be subserved thereby.
George F. Neal of the Commercial
Publishing Company objected to the
â¢.ward being made on the ground that
his bid was $600 lower than Crocker"s.
Chairman Booth of the committee stated
that the samples furnished by the Crock
er Company were superior to the others.
The resolution rescinding a previous
resolution selecting fifty vara block No.
177, bounded by Mason, Taylor, Chestnut
and Francisco streets, for a children's
playground as an alternative site to
block 129, bounded by Powell, Stockton.
Filbert and Greenwich streets, was in
definitely postponed. This leaves block
177 as the choice of the joint Committee
Â©n Public Utilities and Finance.'
The petition of the Mount Vernon Im
provement Club that sufficient bonds be
â¢old to build a sewer system from Cayuga
avenue, along Onondaga avenue to Ocean
avenue, \u25a0to ' San Jose avenue to * Howth
sjtreet; also from Ocean avenue .along San
Jcse avenue to Unadilla avenue, was
referred to the Street Committee. The
petition states that the system is. needed
in view of the big improvements pro
jected In the district.
The City Attorney was directed to so
licit offers for the sale of a lot in the
block bounded by Clay, Sacramento," East
and Davis streets, on which to construct
a pumping station in connection wtyh the
sewer to be constructed in Mission street
from Second to East, under the bond
Issue.
The sum of $450 was allowed to build a
cement sidewalk along the concrete para
pet on the Cliff House road, which will
complete the improvement.
Boiler Inspector Porter was directed
to investigate the dangerous condition of
the boiler on the 'Fourth-street bridge,

OFFERS LANDS

Public Spirited Citizen to
Donate a Lot on Harrison

BOTTLE VABD IB OPPOSED
Ordinance Prohibiting Rail
road ;â¢ Along Nineteenth
Avenue Meets Opposition
At yesterday's ' meeting of the Super
visors' .Finance Committee, , Brandensteln
stated that Charles S. Griffith of Pleas
anton, Alameda County, had offered to
donate .a lot at . the southwest cor
ner of Harrison street and Stanley
place, between First and. Second streets,
as a site for a children's playground. The
lot is 120x100 feet in area' and Griffith de
sired to know if , the city would accept
the land, on condition, however, that it
should be used for the purpose specified
only. The committee lost no time in ac
cepting the generous offer and paid a
tribute to the j intending donor for his
public-spirited act. It was said that Grif
tfth's sisters are associated . with him in
the ownership of the lot and join with
him in the laudable offer to provide a
breathing space for children in a district
where it la sadly needed.
The Griffith family home was formerly
located on the lot that Is now offered to
the city.' ' ,
When the lot has been formally con
veyed to the city it will be turned over to
the Board of Education for . handball
courts and other athletics.
: The ordinance declaring Nineteenth
avenue from Ocean avenue \u25a0' to H street
to be a public boulevard along and upon
which no i railroad shall ever be con
structed was referred to the Street Com
mittee, the following protest having been
filed by property owners:
We, the unders'urned. interested and owning
property on Nineteenth avenue, most respect
fully protest ajcainst making said . avenue a
boulevard for the following reasons: -
That when the property owners graded and
macadamized Nineteenth avenue at a great
expense they bad no Intention of having It .
declared a boulevard, but hoped and expected
that the railroad would be extended from In
gloside along said avenue to Golden Gate ParT;
so as to make It available for building homes
thereon. Should it be declared a boulevard, it
will prevent this belnsr done, as the distance
from the cars will surely prevent settlement.
Supervisor Connor said it- was usual
for protests to be referred to the Street
Committee and while he did ,' not think
that the protest would avalluhe property
owners are entitled to a hearing.' -
, The following bills were p&ss'ed to print:
I Providing- for the full acceptance of ' Eighth

In the testimony of S. S. McCurdy.of
the Equitable Society before' the~New
York investigating committee' the' fact
was tiiscloscd that his company, through
its alegar representative^ in California,
E. S. Pillsbury, enjoined, Clunie: from
revoking its license. ;; This action; fol
lowed upon Clunle's. demands^-for ;in
formation about. the company's affairs,,
which," the insurance people: contended,
he was hot . entitled to. In , that Tsame
connection was related the story that
Pillsbury had employed the late-Thomas
J.. clunie^ as 'special counsel/ for.; the
company at. a salary of $250]ia-month,
Thomas being a brother of Com
missioner. Also 'did it develop that

Tracing the ramifications of the Com
missioner's office and following along
the* same general line. of inquiry, the
records ' were - discoyered^yesterday
which show conclusively tliat*the*flre
insurance . companies-:. were , given as

The^ lire insurance companies were
given' special' attention by Clunie, the
court documents reveal,, sometime be
fore he turned to the life corporations. ,
It' appears that' in' 1898 Clunie', made
a demand upon all of the .'fire insurance
companies -that,' they should "comply
with, an act of the; Legislature,* which
required them. , to pay v l;per . cent of
their gross annual, premium collections
into* the treasury "of .the 'city . or -the
county in which the business was done.
This demand was asserted upon the-'au
tnority of a'legislatlve measure passed
In 1885.. Butthe^flre insurance compa
nies-resisted payment jj on. the ground
that I the Supreme i Court;had 5 declared
the act" to be â¢ unconstitutional i and -that
the Commissioner bad \u25a0no authority -to
enforce'liis demand.' It was also set forth
that Clunie had acknowledged-Mhe^de
cision of the Supreme ; C9urt,' ; but per
sisted in his demand./offering.the alter
native of a revocation of the companies'
licenses." '\u25a0-' : \u25a0'..â¢\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0'\u25a0'.-.â¢\u25a0\u25a0:,.\u25a0â¢:â¢..''-:.'/\u25a0\u25a0'-'"' '-"I â¢

Following closely upon the -heels of
this controversy iwith: the fire" insurance
companies, .'a^second: dispute arose ".be-r

This time the. question lof their bonds
\u25a0 was ' raised.' -. Each company, : under the
law, was compelled to iflle ; a^bond". In
$2000 .whenV. its license ,"was i Issued.
These bonds,- prior to" the time- Clunie
became Commissioner," had; beenj given
by- personal â¢ sureties.'"" They"' v were ." ob-'

to be \u25a0insufficient: , The fcompanies.vso

Two Lots V Are Available
: There was a hitch, yesterday In the
matter of the 'selection . of , a site for the
car and power house for the proposed
municipal Geary-street road, which may
delay the construction of . the . road, in
definitely. " City: j Engineer Woodward
threw .a. bombshell Into "the -camp, of
the joint; Supervisors'- Public Utilities
and : Finance Committee when -he flatly
declined j t* . recommend the two sites at
the corner of Geary "and 1 Baker streets
and at. Josephine street and Point Lo
bos avenue, "which are under alterna
tive consideration *by, the committee,
. "I desire to .."call^ your 'attention to
the irregularity of your proceedings,"
said Woodward, fin" the selection* of a
site. There has beÂ«n no pretense of
consulting- the City Engineer in the
matter. '.I; would not recommend either
of the, sites; before, the. board; as I.con
siderthe power-house should be placed
at and Geary, streets, -in view
ofj the fact 'that' a cross-town -line will'
be built in the near future which would
not be possible.'if the.' other sites are
chosen." â¢'â¢' '.".' v"' 'â¢ ' â¢ \u25a0--\u25a0â¢â¢ â¢ ..'.\u25a0
.When \ Woodward was asked if En
gineer Stut,: who had: recommended. the
Baker-street site _â¢ in â¢ preference - to . the
one on 'street, -had not been
appointed "\u25a0 consulting engineer - for the
plans at his (Woodward's) request,
Woodward said : this was. not soÂ»in so
far, as the selection" of*a power-house
site is concerned. "."., .' . -.
Stut .testified that it would tost thY
city $4000 to sewer, grade and do the
streetv-work lon the Josephine-street
site and $1500 to build a retaining wall.
Attorney. .Mcc, \u25a0 representing, the owners
of the- latter site, contradicted Stut's
statement, c saying, that Engineer Roe
had, estimated, that It would cost but
JSSO to put the lot in condition. Mcc
charged that Stut had not considered
the cost -of power, and .foundations' in
his preference . for .the .Baker-street lot,
and' that ne was "wholly and unquali-"
iiedly,: In ! error ; in" his figuring." Mee '
said his engineers 'could never secure a
hearing belore. Stut. â¢ " .'\u25a0
S It: was brought out that former ' City
Engineer . Grunsky. .had, recommended
the -Broderiek-street site, -but Mcc said
his engineers '.had informed -him that
the '"-. Joaephine-street site.w as fetter
suited for Â«the "power-house. ..
".Stut said he' had, eiideavored^ to.ar
range i a meeting : of Mee'a engineers
with the'Clty Engineer, but -the former
had not ] responded." Stut 1 said-, it -was
the first time" he had been accused .of
figuring, too high! several railroad con
structors having told him his estimates :
were too 10w. .;/ â¢ \u25a0
H. M.Wooley said' that the Geary
street road could not be run:with.6so
kilo watts' of 'electricity, as claimed by
Stut. Wooley asked that Professor Co
rey or Engineer Babcock be engaged to
pass on the statement - made by Stut
and he would pay the bill if 'they de
cided 7 against hla: contention. ..' i, ;
-. D'Ancona ' said the Baker-street . site
had everything in its favor, and he ob
jected to having. Stut's estimates passed
upon," as engineers .might giye>aryihg
estimates on -the same proposition.
D'Ancona said ; that ' while -the- Broder
ick-street.lslte .would be more advan
tageous if a'crAss-tpwn line "were built,
the 'board .would 'm ot be., justified in
purchasing it/owing to Its greater cost.
D'Ancona; urged; the 'purchase of/.the
Baker-street lot at ;a.prlce approxi
mating^ its appraised; value of $16,500,
lri; order that condemnation proceedings
would not'be resorted, to. ''The owners
offer the lot f0r517,600. . â¢ ,
. . The committee finally,- decided to rec
ommend that either the Baker />r. the
Broderick ; street \u25a0 site jbe selected, and
that the City Attorney, enter- Into nego
tiations" with the owners of the latter
site for its , purchase. Engineer, Stut
was.thea directed 'to prepare plans and
specifications for. the Geary-street road
on .'the- assumption that the Broderick
or Baker : street 'i site will -be selected,
and he agreed Uo file; them, next "Mon
day '', ; The â¢ Broderick-street -site has
been appraised at, 528,000, and has been
-already offered f or J $30,000. *
. During the* debatevthe friction exist
ing between Woodward and Stut was
apparent at several stages. Once, when
Stut was testifying, as' to the grades; of
the \u25a0 ; Josephine-street Woodward
snapped.out: .' â¢ .''â¢" .'*" '.\u25a0'"\u25a0 . ..;,.-..
â¢â¢Why do you say. these things here
and talk differently, to .me?" to which
query: Stut vouchsafed no reply.
