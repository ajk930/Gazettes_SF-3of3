MINNEAPOLIS. Dec. 14.â Three men
â¢were killedâ two firemen and one citi
*en. the latter by a live wireâ and
four million dollars' worth of
property was destroyed by a fire in
the business district of Minneapolis,
which started at 10 o'clock last night.
At 2 o'clock this (Wednesday) morn-
Ing the conflagration was only par
tially under control.
The firemen seem to have the flames
confined to three burning buildings,
two of which are ruined and a third,
the Powers department store, the larg
est in the city, damaged by water and
fire to the extent of one or two million
dollars.
Because cf the dense smoke, it was
almost Impossible to gain access to the
burring buildings. The heat is intense,
despite the zero weather prevailing.
The fire will, it seems, burn itself out.
as the firemen are confining their ef
forts to the surrounding and adjoining
property, -vhich is still in danger.
In the front of the burning Boutell
Brothers' building there stands a street
car totally demolished by a falling
electric light pole, from which several
live wires were burned. Only one man
was reported killed by these wires,
though several were stunnedâ how se
riously is liOt known. '
Without do-ubt the conflagration is
the mcst disastrous that has ever_i'isiLT
ed this city, in the loss of life and
property, striking the rirhest and larg
est firm? of the city. All business was
suspended in the newspaper row when
it seemed the entire block would be
consumed, but now that the fire has
been placed partially under control
work has been resumed and the morn
ing papers will appear as usual.

Erxclk." D:er>at^Â»i to The Call
RENO, Dec. 13.â A party of men
passed through this city yesterday en
route to Tonopah and Goldfield, where
they will endeavor to organize a com
pany to capture the camels upon the
deserts in Southern Nevada and use
them in packing freight between Tono
pah, Goldfield and other mining campa
In that section of the State. There
are no railroads and very few teams in
the mining districts and it is thought
the camels will supply the means of
transportation better than anything
else.
There are a large number of camels
running wild near Tonopah and could
easily be captured. The camels were
brought to Nevada in 1S54 by Major
Henry C. Wayne, acting under orders
from the United States Government. It
was thought that they would be bet
ter than horses and they were used
for years in carrying wood from the
mountains to the Virginia mines and
ealt from Washoe City to Virginia
City. It Is said that they would carry
half a cord of wood at a time and that
in carrying ealt from Washoe City
they would carry 800 pounds twenty
miles a day for a distance of 200 miles.

ARIS, Dec. 13.â Although the inves

of Deputy Eyveton has not been com
pleted, facts have leaked out which
render it certain that Syveton commit
ted suicide owing to private trouble
wholly unconnected with politics.
The San Francisco Call.
Assistance was obtained to-night
from St. Paul, ten miles east, that city
having sent over all Its available fire
apparatus. The strong wind blowing
carried the flames to buildings blocks
away, many small fires being started.
The fire was discovered in Peck's
store at Fifth avenue south and Fifth
street. It soon got beyond control and
attacked Boutell Bros.' store. The big
store, filled with draperies and rugs
hung from display racks, was easy
prey for the flames and the store was
hopelessly ruined.
"With the firemen still working on
Bcutell's building the walls fell with
a crash. Two firemen were seen in the
glare that lighted the whole city to
be buried beneath the avalanche of
brick and mortar. One of the men
caught by the falling walls was a
member of the salvage corps. The
other was a fireman from one of the
engine companies.
* The fire spread to the New England
House furnishing- establishment, acros-s
the street from the Boifcell store. Then
it leaped to the Powers Mercantile
Company's great department store.
The district in which the fire oc
curred Is closely built, most of the
buildings being substantial brick and
stone structures.
The Northwest Bank building, thft
Phoenix office bitfldinr, Uhe- National
Bank of Commerce, the New York Life

Pickering of Harvard Says
He Has Known for Years
Moon Has Cracks in It
irÂ«o â¢Â«u, <n tjojwiBKi rÂ«pÂ»<:s
BOSTON, Dec. 13.â According to As
sistant Professor William H. Pickering
of the Harvard Astronomical Observa
tory the moon is cracked In 1000 places.
Professor Pickering made the state
ment to-night in connection with the
press report from Berkeley, Cal., an
nouncing the discovery by Assistant
Astronomer J. D. Perrine of the Lick
Observatory of a great crack or rill ex
tending lengthwise through the v.alley
of the Alps for a distance of eighty
miles. â¢ ' : .'\
"Why," 'he said, when shown the ar
ticle, "that is nothing new. I remem
ber observing that crack in 1S92, but I
never embodied it In any of my re
ports because it was so unimportant in
comparison with others I have seen. I
should say the moon had at least 1000
cracks. They are scattered indiscrim
inately over its surface except that
there are few of them near the poles.
The one in -question is in latitude 50.
They are caused by a contraction ef the
moons crust."

similar feelings, of respect with regard
to artistic relics."
The press and public applaud the

President Gives the
Plan His Sup

Tribunal to Have Charge ol

Proposed Measure Greatly Enlarges
the Powers of the Present
Commission. ,
Special Diepatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU. HOTEL BARTON,
WASHINGTON. Dec. 13.â President
Roosevelt has agreed to accept rail
road rate legislation in the form of a
court, of .interstate commerce. Har
mony between the White House, and
Senate leaders has been established
and efforts have already been jj begun
to accomplish something at the pres
ent session of Congress. Whether the
bill can be finally passed is still prob
lematical. . The President, his cabinet,
and. legislators interested in the ques
tion find it so. large and far reaching
that nothing can â¢', be .done In ' a hurry,
but t be desire of the .administration is
to', Have the queston settled on â  a j per
manent basis at the earliest possible
moment, v This means' the nek t session;
if not the, present orit.
The Call is able to present the text
of the bill which will be used as basis
of. legislation. It will be the frame
work of the discussion and conferences
at the White" House and In the Sen
ate and is now in the hands of Attor
ney General Moody for consideration
and perfection.
It establishes a circuit court. of in
terstate commerce in each of the nine
judicial circuits of the United States
now existing and a circuit court of in
terstate, commerce appeals, with pro
vision for final review by the Supreme
Court of the United States. The Judges
of these interstate courts are to be ap
pointed for life and Jrora both politi
cal . parties, thus establishing a non
partisan b?nch.
ADDS TO COMMISSION'S POWER.
It also is in contemplation, but not
yet embodied in the bill, to give mem
bers of the interstate commerce com
mission certain powers of United States
district attorneys, that they may bring
suits.
President Roosevelt had a conference
to-day with Attorney General Moody
and Senator Spooner and expressed his
willingness to listen to the lawers of
the administration and the Senate. At
torney General Moody is a firm advo
cate of the circuit court of interstate
commerce idea and so is Secretary
Morton. Morton is to be retained in
the cabinet largely for the purpose of
assisting and advising the admlnistra
ton in the matter of railroad legisla
tion.
Another, important advocate of the
circuit court of interstate commerce is
Judge Grosscup of Chicago, who sat
in the npef trust case and whote views
have been -made known to the Presi
dent Senator Elklns, chairman of the
interstate, commerce committee of the
Senate,, is advocating such a court and
has recently been in conference with
Judge Grosscup, whose assistance in
framing the projected legislation was
requested.
SENATE DISPLAYS INTEREST.
Since , ft became known that the
President would not insist upon legis
lation giving the' Interstate, commerce
commission power to revise and estab
lish'railroad rates and would accept an
interstate commerce court, there has
been a decided change of tactics in the
Senate. Senator Elklns * has called a
meeting of the â¢ Interstate commerce
commission for next Friday, when the
question will at once be taken up.
The proposed bill is almost word for
word the measure drawn up by Rich
ard Olney, former attorney general,
and Introduced by Senator Sawyer, of
Wisconsin,. in January, 1893. The origi
nal bill had a section which repealed
the act establishing the interstate
commerce commission, but this is not
contemplated now. On <the contrary
this commission is to be given some
additional power, but not to the ex
tent of revising or establishing rates.

RENO. Dec. 13.â Two Indians were
attacked by a large black bear on Ber

flght they succeeded in killing the en

was unequal and the Indians were torn
and cut in a^terrible manner by the

The' bear was sleeping in the willows
along the bank of the stream when the
Indians, who were fishing, came upon
it. The animal rushed at them with an
angry, growl and succeeded in knocking
one of the Indians senseless with a
blow of its paw. The beast then closed
with. the other redskin and endeavored
to 'draw him within reach of Its open

BOSTON. Dec. 13. â President Wil
liam C. Greene of the- Greene Consol
idated Copper Company published
here to-day his half-page of bitter de
nunciation of Thomas W. Lawson for
the latter's methods of advertising
and raiding Amalgamated and other
copper stocks. Colonel Greene de
nounced Lawson as a faker, a charla
tan, a liar and a robber of the poor
widows and orphans. ! He announced
that he was coming to Boston to tell
Lawson to his face in Lawson's of
fice the very same things.
Lawson has replied to this attack,
saying he will continue in hi3
course despite Greene, the Standard
Oil, "the system" or any living: being.
He declares that he is not responsible
for the losses of Colonel Greene
(amounting to 55.000.000, it is said)
in Greene Consolidated stock or for
the drop in that stock thi3 week.
Lawson says that Greene Consolidat
ed was one of the stocks he exempted
from attack in his recent drives at the
market.
Everything is tense excitement here
to-night, as it is believed that Greene
will make good his threat and appear
before Lawson to-morrow, bent upon
a personal encounter. It is said that
Lawson's rooms at Young's are close
ly guarded by detectives and that
Lawson sits at a desk with a six
shooter In an open drawer at his el
bow.
Lawson's reply to-day was most pa
cific, and spoke of Colonel Greene in
the highest terms of praise and ap
preciation, while it also breathed de
fiance.
GREENE'S ENORMOUS LOSSES.
Greene is said to have organized a
pool recently to "bull" Greene cop
per stock, and to have lost $3. 000.000
in the last few days. Several time3
attempts have been made by Amal
gamated interests to secure control of
the property, but Greene has always
defeated them. It was rumored to
day that they had at last wrested con
trol from him In the recent slump, but
he declares that he and his associates
still hold the fort, he himself owning
252.000 shares out of 864.000.
Clarence W. Barron. publisher of
the Boston News Bureau, has taken
a hand azaln and deals less gently
with Lawson than the latter does with
the Arizona copper king. Barron
says:
"He has sagacity enough to attach
to his lies connection with persons or
fact*, statements of policies, generally
known or believed to be in existence.
Now, it the evidence has not been de
stroyed â and mysterious fires have al
ready burned many books â the . dis
tance between Thomas W. Lawson
and the penitentiary may not be so
great a3 he imagines. He can hood
wink the public for a time, but' ha
cannot hoodwink, bribe or frighten
me. for he has tried it over and over
again. Some day I wiil tell all. If he
survives? the strainâ mentally, physi
cally and financially â through which
he is now passing."

After the first three-quarters of an
hour of trading the market was ap
parently much firmer, pahic conditions
had practically disappared and there
was every indication that prices would
not only recover from yesterday's close,
but might even go above them.
Meanwhile Wall street was ina hil
arious mood over the long distance war
of words between Colonel Greene, presi
dent of the Greene Consolidated Copper
Company, and Lawson. Lawson wait
ed in vain for Colonel Greene to show
up in his Boston office and whiled away
the tedious hours in occasional hot
wires to his rival. A few excerpts are
interesting.
"You know you're a liar," wrote Law
son. "You brought me your Consoli
dated company and said, 'Lawson, you
are the only man on earth to whom J
w&uld trust it.' I took it and for five
months ran it and paid all its expenses
to an amount of, I think, over $100,000."
"I know if you had been in your
right mind you would never have
signed the dirty document, probably
written by others who had not the
manliness to do what you do, and
which you published this morning."
"Now, for your threatsâ for I read
clearly your meaning when you re
peated three times you would come to
my office. I know you are a brave
man; I know not only because you
have told me, but because I have veri
fied it, that you have notches on your
gun to mark where you went up
against bad men in Arizona and Mex
ico. I know you have made some of
the leaders of the 'System' in New
York give over their schemes to ruin
you, simply by calling their attention
to the fact that you were going to call
upon them at their offices; but let me
say to you you have picked the wrong
customer; you or any of those who
have egged you on, or any of the dirty
curs of the 'System.' may come to my
office or any other place that is con
venient or accessible, and when you
come I will be there to meet you."
HARD WILL NOT YIELD.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 13.â After sev
eral days of study and discussion of
the Statehood bill by the Committee on
Territories, Senator Beveridge, the
chairman, expects to report the bill
favorably to-morrow. Senator Bard,
v.^ho has been alone amonK the Repub
lican members of the committee In op
position to it, declares his intention of
carrying his fight to the floor of the
Senate, although he fears it will be
hopeless. â  , , .
Bard opposes the bill on the ground
that Arizona Is almost unanimous
against being forced Into the Union
coupled up with New Mexico, and on
the other and broader ground that the
West is handicapped, in Congress and
always will be by the few number of
States as compared to the East and
the consequent loss in representation
In the upper house. It. was on these
grounds that Nedham, almost alone,
fought the bill in the House. Bard
wants Arizona and New Mexico to
wait until sufficiently populous to be
admitted as two States. .
BALL IX PENSION OFFICE.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 13. â In the

the use of the Pension Office building
for the inaugural ball also was passed.
Barley expressed^ opposition to It. The
House resolution for an adjournment
for the Christmas holidays extending
from December 21 to January 4 was
adopted.
On motion of Long, the Senate fixed
the date for the reception of the
statue of former Senator John J. In-
B-alla, contributed to Statuary Hall by
the State of Kansas, for January 21
next.

JUDGE SWAYNE
IS IMPEACHED
House After, Sharp Debate
Calls Him to Account for
Misbehavior in Office
SITS AS A- GEAND JURY
Gillett of California an
Active Participant in
the Unusual Proceedings
WASHINGTON, Dec. 13.â Sitting as
a Grand Jury, the House of Repre
sentatives to-day, with almost a full
membership, adopted a resolution pro
viding for the impeachment of Judge
Swayne of the Northern District of
Florida for. "high crimes and misde
meanors." Throughout the session in- ;
tense interest was shown* by the mem
bers. Following the adoption- of the
impeachment resolution, . provision was
made for the appointment of five mem
bers to % notify the Senate of the im
peachment and for a committee of
seven to present the case to the Senate.
To-day's proceedings , were the first
of their kind since the impeachment in
1876 of General Belknap, who was Sec
retary of War in General Grant's Cab
inet.
In support of the charge of misbehav
ior, Palmer of Pennsylvania said the
evidence showed that out of each year
Judge Swayne spent on am average 212
days somewhere else, without holding
court. Judge Swayne, he said, never
voted in Florida, never registered there
and never lived there in any proper
sense of the term.
As Palmer detailed the various
amounts paid to Judge Swayne as nec
essary expenses he was subjected to
a fire of questions by several members.
A* question by Adams of Pennsylvania,
if it was the custom of other Judges
to accept the maximum of $10 a day
for expenses, roused Palmer, who an
swered with an emphatic "No!" adding
that if it was the custom it would be
no evidence in this case.
"We are," he said with emphasis,
"trying the case of Judge Swayne and
not all of the Judges of the United
States."
Replying to Lacey of Iowa, Palmer
said the committee did not look into
the question of whether or -not the
rate of $10 a day was a fixed allow
ance, not thinking it relevant. The
charge against Judge Swayne of
swearing that his expenses were $10
n day, when in fact these expenses
were proved considerably less, he said,
stunfo unexplained and undefended by
the Judge.
After concluding his resume of the
evidence, Palmer said that if Judge
Swayne had done well he ought to be
vindicated and sent out with the
commendation "Well done, thou good
and faithful servant." If Judge
Swayne had done ill, he ought to be
sent to trial, "where his excuse and
apologies may or may not receive con
sideration."
If the House was of the opinion that
Judge Swayne's conduct had been
commendable, "let him go scot free."
He added, amid impressive silence, "In
my Judgment- it .will be a sorry day
for the republic; when such, behavior
is commendipd. by. the representatives
of the people." ; - ' ' *
Clayton of Alabama was â  particu
larly severe in his arraignment of what
he characterized as Judge Swayne's
excuses and testimony regarding his
failure to acquire a residence in Pen
sacola.
Ah," he said, striking his desk,
"when he studies the case and the
report he sees that he did not swear
lar enough and now he tip-toes on
this question of residence."
Judge Swayne's amended testimony,
he declared, amounted to nothing.
When the Judge took steps to acquire
a residence in his district, "he had
wind of these impeachment proceed
ings."
The' question of Judge Swayne's
residence was also discussed by Gil
lett of California, who insisted that
Judge Swayne had distinctly shown
an Intent to make Pensacola his
home. All the effort and industry of
the parties making the charges against
Judge Swayne, he said, had not pro
duced a single witness who said
Judge Swayne resided or had a home
in Delaware. It made no difference,
he contended, if Judge Swuyne was not
in Pensacola over twenty days a year,
because he might have been some
where else "doing business for his
country." The record showed that
Judge Swayne went to Florida, Ala
bama and Texas to hold court.
' "There was no evidence." he main
tained, "that anybody suffered injury
'by reason of the fact that Judge
Swayne was not in Florida.""
The judicial acts of Judge Swayne
were next taken up by Gillett, who
justified them on the ground that
Judge Swayne not only had the legal
right to act us he did In the several
cases complained of, but also had ju
risdiction so to do.
While he admitted, in reply to a
question by Palmer, that traveling
over the country by Judge Svvayne in
a /private car of the \ Jacksonville,
Tampa and Key West Railroad
(then in the hands of a receiver ap
pointed by Judge Swayne) was a thing
that ought not perhaps have been
done, he contended that' it did not in
volve that turpitude that \ should
cause hl3 impeachment.
The subject of the amounts charged
by Judge Swayne and sworn to as
having been expended by him for
reasonable expenses, said Gillett, was
a serious accusation. If the $10 a day
was collected by Judge Swayne with
wrongful " intent, its collection should
not be excused.
Mann of Illinois provoked laughter
by calling attention to the fact /that
Gillett; had made a report in the'ease
one way; and had made a speech the
other, and he tried to secure a cate
gorical: answer as to whether or not he
thought the resolution should pass.
."When the roll call . comes," said Gil
lett, "the gentleman from California
will tell you." -
"Then." retorted Mann, "I shall be
compelled to,yote after the gentleman."
, "If you: will follow the gentleman
from California," quickly replied Gil
lett," ; you may vote ? correctly." ,
Lamar of Florida, who filed the. orig
inal charge against Judge Swaynei
closed 'â  the discussion , by denouncing
the Judge; as "tyrannical and unjust."
The 'previous question was orderedâ
198 to 91. The resolution was " then
agreed on without division. â¢
..Immediately after the adoption of
the ; impeachment resolution ; Palmer, of
fered a resolution ' for- a committee of
seven' to notify the Senate of the action
of the House," and it was , adopted.

WYNNE DISMISSES TWO
LEADING CARRIERS.
LEADERS AMONG LETTER CAR
. RIERS, WHOSE ACTIVITY IX
POLITICS CAUSED DISMISSAL.
SECRETS HELD
DEAR AS LIFE
. WASHINGTON, Dec. 13,â Five wit
nesses ..were examined to-day by the
Senate Committee on Privileges and
Elections in the investigation of pro
tests against Senator Smoot. The first
witness described the .obligations as
sumed by persons who pass through
the endowment house and declared
that every one agrees to submit to
mutilation of the person If he or she
reveals what takes place during the
ceremony.
Two members of the Brigham
Young University testified that they
have maintained polygamous relations
since the manifesto of 1890, and a
teacher asserted that the church has
had religion taught in public schools.
Mrs. Margaret Geddes, a Mormon,
testified concerning her plural mar
riage and broke down on the stand.
The hearing wiH be continued to-mor
row. . 'â¢:â ;.'
J. H. Wallis Sr., a Mormon from
Salt Lake City, .who has had three
wives, was the first witness. He said
he never believed fully in the celestial
marriages to the dead, but four times
had stood as proxy for four marriages
of living women to dead men. He
married his present wife in the tem
ple. Explaining the marriages in the
temple, Wallis said It is 'necessary to
take the endowment before marriage
and In this way he ' had passed
through the endowment house twenty
times at least. The ceremonies, he
said, had always been substantially
the same and each one consumed
about two hours. \
Wallis said he had a distinct recol
lection of the ceremonies within the
temple. He was asked to give the
oaths. taken by those who participated
and this he did, together with a de
scription of the secret signs executed
by each person. Nearly all of ob
ligations were that those who took
part would not reveal anything they
saw or heard on peril of mutilation
of the person, and every one who passed
the temple, said the witness, was com
pelled to asree to the conditions laid
down by the priests.
The penalties agreed to were given
by Wallis as follows: That the throat
be cut from ear to ear and the tongue
be .torn off; that the breast be cut
asunder and the heart and vitals be
torn from the body; that the body be

JOHN DUNCAN'S SONS, Agents, NEW YOK.C
WASHINGTON, Dec. 13. â Post
master General Wynne to-day re
moved from office Frank H. Cunning
h&m, of South Omaha, Neb., who is
president of the National Association
of Rural Carriers, and James C. Kel
ler, of Cleveland. O... who. is at the
head of the National Association of
letter Carriers.
The dismissals are the result of an
investigation of charges of insubordi
nation, of beinjr absent from duty
without leave and violation of the
President's order of January 31. 1902.
prohibiting individual , or organized
attempts of Government employes to
influence legislation or to solicit in
crease of pay.
Cunningham applied last October
for a leave of absence. The Post
office Department declined to approve
the application. Cunningham, however,
ignored this action and came East.
Thenceforth, it is announced at the
Postoffice Department, he apparently
devoted his entire time to efforts to
secure pledges from candidates for
election or re-election to Congress to
support the bill approved by the car
riers' association for an increase of
their pay. . .~. v â 
His methods. It is charged, were in
distinct violation of the executive
order, which expressly forbids "all
Government officers and " employes,
either directly or indirectly, individu
ally or through associations, to solicit
an increase of pay or to influence or
attempt to influence in their own in
terest any other legislation whatever,
either before Congress or its commit
tees or in any way save through the
headquarters in or under which they
are serving, on penalty of dismissal
from the Government service."
The association sent out circulars
to Congressmen lrr an effort to secure
pledges. These letters, it is stated,
were signed by Secretary Tumber, of
the association, who is also a rural
carrier at Rockport, N. T., and his
case is under investigation.
Cunningham submitted his resigna
tion yesterday, but the department
declined to accept it.
The case of James C. Keller, of
the Cleveland, O., Postoffice, who is
head of the National Association of
Letter Carriers, also reached a climax
to-day. His activity during the cam
paign has been under investigation
and some days ago he was ordered to
return forthwith to his duties at
Cleveland. He sent a reply t<\ the
Postofflce Department, which was in
terpreted as insubordination, and he
also was dismissed.
'* At the meeting of the Cabinet to
day. Postmaster General Wynne re
ported to the President the action he
had taken in the cases of Cunningham
and Keller, and explained the nature
of the charges against them. Presi
dent Roosevelt practically indorsed the
Postmaster General's action.

bowels cut out; that if demanded we

The next obligation was one o/
chastity, In which the obligator agreed
not to cohabit with any person not
given him or Her by the priests.
Another obligation, said the witness,
was one that "we would never cease to
Importune high heaven to avenge the
blood of the prophets upon the na
tions of the earth, or the inhabitants
of the earth. This was followed by a
quotation from the Scriptures, I think
Revelation vi:9: 'The souls of those
slain cried aloud on the altars* for
vengeance.' " '
Josiah Hickman, a teacher in Brig
ham Young University, testified that
he was married first in 1884 and again
In 1890. The first wife died In 1900. For
ten years he said he lived with two
wives and had children by both of
them.
The witness said he went through
the temple with his second wife, two
or three vears ago, and they were
sealed, but no legal marriage had
taken place. He said he had taken no
steps to conform to the law in relation
to marriages. *
"Then as you understand it you are
not legally married to your present
wife?" asked Taylor.
"No, sir; not so far."
* "You said 'not so far," " said "Van
Cott. one of the attorneys for Smoot.
"What did vou mean by that?"
Hickman explained that he had been
a little negligent, but that he and his
wife -had decided that they should be
married. He said of the fifty or sixty
teachers in the university he was mor
ally certain that only two were polyga
mists.
Mrs. Marsaret Geddes of Salt Lake
City said she was born In Glasgow,
Scotland, where she was converted to
the Mormon faith and went to Utah
twenty years aso. She became the
plural wife of William Geddes In Lo
gan, Utah, the same year. \She said
she did not live with her husband
much, as he remained in Oregon, his
other wife living In Blaine City. She
had four children. Her husband died
in Oregon. She then went-to her hus
band's first wife and there a baby was
born. She broke down cryingr as she
gave this evidence.
It was brought out that her husband
died thirteen years ago, and that her
youngest child Is now five and a half
years old. She said she had not been
married a second time and refused to
give the name of her youngest child'3
father. She broke down again as shs
told the committee she had no one to
look after her. and that she sat in the
waiting-room from 2 o'clock this morn
ing until daylight after arriving In
Washington.
The politics of many an orator de
pends on the party offering the highest
price for wind. .

PITTSBURG, Pa., Dec 13.â The name of J. W. Friend,
vice president of the Pressed Steel Car Company, has been freely
used to-day in connection with the unidentified Pittsburg man
who loaned Mrs. Chadwick a sum of money placed at from $500,
000 to $800,000. In this connection a strange story of a meet
ing in New York is repeated. It is to the effect that last Wednes
day Friend, Mrs. Chadwick and Andrew Squire of Cleveland met
in New York at the Holland House, and that at that meeting
Friend, covered the lower part of Mrs. Chadwick's photograph
with his hand and commented upon the remarkable resemblance
to Andrew Carnegie.
"We will get our money," he declared, confidently.
The story was shown to Friend this afternoon. He refused
to deny or affirm its truth.
N*EW YORK. Dec 13.â Mrs. Chad- j
wick started for Cleveland on the Buf
falo limited train, which left the Grand
Central station over the New York |
Central at R o'clock to-night. Before j
leaving she made a statement in which j
Jthf declared rhe would pay her obliga- j
tlons and that her sole purpose in go- j
ins -was to face her creditors. She said j
fchf could have obtained bail here if
fche wished to and that one of the most
prominent men in the country had !
offered to-day to go on her bond. j
Mrs. Chadwick left here in custody !
of United States Marshal Henkel and j
two deputy marshals. Marshal Henkel i
raid he would leave the train at i

â¢t(.ur;sel. consented to an interview j
with the newspaper men, who were :
waiting.
It was shortly before 7 o'clock when
thÂ» reporters were admitted to Hen
kel's ofTice, where Mrs. Chadwick was
awaiting them. She was reclining on a
couch and seemed particularly alert.
she was the obsoJute mistress of her
â¢ celt, and either smiled as she gave her
statements or gave way to an ex
pression of bitterness.
"Many statements that have appear
ed are absolutely false." ehe began. "I
have read statements in one cr two pa
â¢ j'ers that are -Absolutely false. I am
physically and mentally broken down-
I am not in any condition to make a
statement.
â  It is not true that I cabled to Dr.
Chndv ick this morning. Dr. Chadwick
cabled me this morning, and that cable
. Ri-Â«m will appear in the Cleveland
Plain Dealer to-morrow morning.
GOING HOME VOLUNTARILY.
" 1 am going home for the sole pur
pose of facing my creditors and the
<.har?res they have irA.de against me. I
am going home voluntarily and not be
cause I could not obtain bail. Since
ii. y arrest I have had offers of bail
from many prominent persons. Isn't
that so, Mr. Carpenter?" she asked,
turning to her counsel.
"Yes. that's true," he replied.
"To-day bail was offered to me by
one of the most prominent men in
. Cleveland, by telegram," said Mrs.
Chadwick. "He said that a wire
would bring him here to furnish any
unocnl of bail that would be wanted.
I have had at least half a dozen prom
inent persons offer me bail to-day. As ;
I said before, I am a wreck. The way
my son and maid, have been harassed
by you young men is absolutely em
barrassing. I want it understood that
I am going home simply because it Is
the place where I should be. I shall
not give bail when I get to Cleveland.
I have the best motive in the world
for not doing so. The history of this,
case from beginning to end will soon
be published in a certain newspaper."
"You will call names, won't you?"
interrupted Carptener.
T shall use no names." corrected
Mrs. Chadwick. "I promised to give
out my story an( i It may take weeks
to get it out. It may be, however, that

she continued with a smile. "When
you young men thought that I was
sick at the Holland House I walked
out right by you and went to the
Fifth Avenue Hotel and afterward
took a cab back to the Holland and
went to bed. I left the Holland
House one night and went out walk-

"Even on the night that it was re

went out, didn't you, Mrs. Chadwick?"
asked Carpenter.
"Yes, I left the Holland at 8 o'clock
and went to the home of one of the
most prominent men in New York and
stayed there until 11:30. When I re
turned to the hotel the elevator man

and whispered: 'The newspaper men

JN'O. J. FULTON'. CO.
ERSONAL
William H. Maneely of 1904 X. Seven-
teenth street, Philadelphia, a prominent
Mason of the Quaker City (member of
the famous Mary Commandery), was in
this city recently, the guest of his
nephew. J. E. Adams, the well-known
merchant of 325 Front street. Fifteen
months before h!s visit his death was
anticipated daily. He was in the last
stages of Brighfs Disease, combined
with Diabetes, and to cna.ble him to sleep
his temperature had to be reduced with
ic*. The phypJcians looked for his death
from day to day. Â«Â«.Â».Â«
One of the most prominent Dhvulrlnn*
in Philadelphia at this juncture did a
most unusual thing. He sent word to
lUaeely that he could probably recover
if he would change his treatment to a
diuretic made In California, called Ful-
ton's Compound, as he had himself lust
gotten recoveries In cases he was treat-
ins wjth It. His suggestion was fol-
lowed and the result was Maneely's re-
covery and visit to California. Mr
Maneely pave the names of several cases
of Bright's Disease and Diabetes who
had likewise recovered, including Ricard
Filbert and Mrs. E. T. Snow of that city
and Ftated that there were now fifty-two
physicians in the Quaker City savlne
lives* with Fulton'* Compounds. If any-
body questions this remarkable recovery
we would refer thom to Mr. J. E. Adams
of 225 Front street.

about Mr. Carnegie and nothing to
say about any one else. I want to say
emphatically that I have not been
compelled to return to Cleveland. If
the Grand Jury had indicted me fifty
times I would have gone back Just the
same. I was ready to go back a week
ago last Saturday. I had all my
things packed, but they wanted me to
Â£o down to Wall street."
Mrs. Chadwick would not say who
"they" meant.
"The result was that I did not get
away." she continued. "I feel a little
better than I did a week ago, but am
still nervous and I can hardly stand
on my feet."
Mrs. Chadwick was taken from the
Tombs in a carriage by Marshal Hen
kel shortly before 4 o'clock. An hour
earlier Carpenter had gone to the of
fice of United States District Attorney
Burnett in the Federal building and in
formed him that his cleint would
waive examination. Marshal Henkel
and Commissioner Shields were noti
fied at the same time.
BECOMES HYSTERICAL.
At the Tombs, in deference to the
protests of Mrs. Chadwick. Warden
Flynn permitted Henkel's carriage to
be driven into the courtyard, in order
that the prisoner might avoid the bat
tery of cameras. The party drove rap
idly to the Federal building and the
woman was taken to the Marshal's
office, no one but herself and Marshal
Henkel being permitted In the eleva
tor. Arriving in the Marshal's office
the woman almost collapsed. Commis
sioner Shields was notified and came
to the office, cancelled the commit
ment and formally delivered her over
to the Federal authorities. She was
then taken before Judge Adams of the
United States Circuit Court, who
signed an order for her removal to
Cleveland.
Mrs. Chadwick was hysterical when
she returned to the Marshal's office,
and it required the combined efforts of
the Marshal and Carpenter to soothe
her.
After her meeting with the reporters
Mrs. Chadwick waited in the Mar
shal's office until time to leave for the
Grand Central station, when she came
out leaning heavily on Marshal Hen
kel's arm and that of Carpenter. With
Deputy Marshals guarding them, the
party walked to the elevator and de
scended to the street. There Mrs.
Chadwick was assisted into the car
riage and was at once driven away.
When the carriage reached the Hotel
Breslin, at Twenty-ninth street ana
Broadway, the party stopped and Mar
shal Henkel went into the hotel. He
returned in a few minutes with the
maid, who carried several bundles.
She. with Marshal Henkel and one or
the deputies, accompanied Mrs. Chad
wick to the station. The maid accom
panied Mrs. Chadwick to Cleveland.
JUDGE OLCOTT A "LAMB."
Tells How He Was Deceived by Cassic
L. Chadwick.
NEW YORK, Dec,. 13. â "I was a
lamb and I regret to say that for fif
teen days I believed in Mrs. Chadwick
and was one of her many victims,"
said ex-Judge William H. K. Olcott,
of a law firm of which ex-Governor
Frank S. Black is a member, to-day.
He continued: ,
My connection and the Arm's connection with
MrÂ». Chadwick Is In about this way. Mrs".
Chadwick came to "our office on March 2. 1904.
and faw ex-Governor Black and myself. She
toid the Governor that Â»he wanted him to go
to Cleveland; that his position as former Gov
ernor of the State of New York would help
her to settle her affairs, and ehe drew from
her reticule $1000 and laid It In front of Gov
ernor Black for his expenses to Cleveland.
The Governor concluded not to fro, and It was
flnallr decided that I should go and for my
fee for one day In Cleveland she paid $500.
The object of her visit to uÂ» waa to have
us relieve her from a threatened attachment
apalnM her home on Euclid avenue Cleveland
which waa to fcave been levied upon by Ober-
Un College for a claim of $78,0QO. This claim.
I understood, waj later paid but not through
thla firm's autplce*. .
Mr*. Chadwick. In that slow, impressive
manner of hers, said to Governor Black: "I
am a very rich woman. I have $5,000,000 In
a trust fund." We were naturally impressed.
In order to make good her statement she pro
duced Irl Reynolds' certificate for the $5.000,C00
of securities held by him. This .naturally led
us to believe that the woman spoke the truth.
I went to Cleveland that nichtâ the night of
March 3 â and remained there all of March 4
returning on March 5. On my arrival in Cleve
land I asked .Mrs. Chadwick to show me her
securities, but under one pretext or another
ehe evaded the proposition and did not enow
them to me. Her excuse all the time was
that In Reynolds was out of town, and finally
after banking hours. 'when I Insisted upon see
ing either the securities or Iri Reynolds she
got Mr. Reynolds on the telephone. I talked
with him and he acknowledged to me having
these securities In his possession. At that
time I believed that they were all right.
Armed with this Information I saw the law
yers of the Oberlln College and Treasurer Sev
erance and inquired about a settlement. They
wanted to know from me If I had any aa
rurances of settlement other than what Mm
Chadwick had given me. I told them that i
had not. They replied to me: "Why you do
not know any more about this caae than we
do.
I had to admit the soft Impeachment As
far as my accomplishing anything with Mrs
Chadwick and the Oberlin people was con
cerned, my visit was futile.- and my trio to
Cleveland ended right there. P
Olcott said that before he left
Cleveland Mrs. Chadwick borrowed
$1500 of him, making out a check for
that amount. She promised, he said,
that the check would be sent or the
money paid not later than March 6,
but she did not do so. He continued:
. I then became somewhat suspicious but not
entirely bo. I still had confidence in her and
probably would 'have believed her to this day
were it net for the fact that I heard from
Cleveland that ehe bad been representing It
about town that I was Mr. Carnegie's repre
sentative, letters to this effetft, asking me
If I were really Mr. Carnegie's representative
c&nie to me and then I lost faith In Mrs. Chad
wick and determined to get my money back.
On March 15 I went to Cleveland and de
manded from Mrs. Chadwick Immediate pay
ment of the $1500 I had loaned her. She re
plied: "Why. . I am a sick woman and. I
cannot pay you to-day." I told her in reply
that I came to 'Cleveland to -get that money,
to get it that day, - and that I should not
leave without it: that if I did not get the
money I would take legal steps against her.
Ehe said that If I Insisted ehe would have the
money Inside of two hours.
At the expiration of two hours I returned
and she paid me $1500. That terminated this
firm's connection with Mrs. Chadwick. Since
then Sin. Chadwick has made repeated efforts
to again retain thla firm to help her out of
her difficulties, but we have always refused
to have anything more to do with her. In
spite of these repeated refusals on our part,
Mrs. Chadwick persisted in her efforts to se
cure the firm's assistance and even on the day
of the arrest of Mrs. Chadwick nhs, sent her
lawyer Edmund W. Powers, to me â ' to retain
us. but we refused* And even no later than
yesterday we were again asked to bs her
counsel and as usual we refused. "*.'â 'â¢'â  *

BAIL OR IMPRISONMENT.
Alternatives Confronting Mrs. Chad
wick in Cleveland.
CLEVELAND, Dec. 13.â The pros
pects to-night are that when Mrs.
Chadwick arrives here she will be
compelled to go to jail, unless she can
give bail in the amount of $40,000.
United States Marshal Frank M.
Chandler said that Mrs. Chadwick
would be taken before Judge Wing,
who would be sitting in the United
States District Court, where, if she
could give bonds, she would be re
leased. Failing to do so, she would be
placed in the county Jail.
The County Grand Jury to-day re
sumed its investigation of the affairs
of Mrs. Chadwick, but returned no in
dictment against her. It is under
stood that an indictment relating to
the uttering and forging of the $5,000,
000 note on deposit in the Wade Park
Bank, which was the principal matter
considered by the investigating body
to-day, had been drafted.
The Grand Jury will meet again to
morrow and if no indictment is brought
in the Inquiry into the affairs of the
county may be considered as ended for
the present.
District Attorney Sullivan to-nieht
received word from Andrew Carneele
that he was suffering from lumbago
and would not be able to attend the
investigation to-morrow. Carneeie.
however, will attend the trial of Mrs.
Chadwick.
Herbert W. Bell, who was appointed
received for Mrs. Chadwick by the
Common Pleas Court, caused excite
ment this morning. He announced that
he had found the Chadwick securities
that had been deposited with the Wade
Park Bank to aggregate $28,000,000, or
nearly double the amount orieinally
supposed. Bell made, this announce
ment before entering the Grand Jury
room to testify as to the nature of the
papers in his possession.
After going over the papers with
County Prosecutor Keeler and the
members of the Jury. Bell altered his
statement, saying that he had over
estimated the amount by $10,246,000. the
face of the trust agreement. There
were two copies of this agreement
among the papers, neither of them be
ing marked as a duplicate, and he had
considered them as separate docu
ments. It was the opinion of both the
receiver and prosecuting attorney that
the second trust agreement was in
tended to be a copy and not a distinct
asset in itself. The amount of securi
ties is. therefore, the same as previous
ly published.
HINTS AT NEW SENSATION.
Clergymnn Intimates the Carnegie
Signatures Are Genuine.
PITTSBURG, Pa., Dec! 13.â Rev. A.
H. Jolly, who united Mrs. Chadwick in
marriage with his cousin. Dr. Leroy S.
Chadwick, in an interview to-day ad
mitted that he was in possession of
several important secrets in connection
with the famous case, but could not
talk for publication. He made a plea
for fair play for Mrs. Chadwick and
said she was a grossly wronged wo
man.
Questioned as to the truth of the
rumor that Mrs. Chadwick had suc
ceeded in negotiating a loan for $800,
000 in Pittsburg he declined to confirm
or deny the report. Continuing he
said:
"It is claimed the paper held by Mrs.
Chadwick is forged- Do you know
that it was forged paper? No one else
does. It remains for the court to prove
that."
At this Junction Jolly was inter
rupted.
"Do you mean to convey the mean
ing that the securities are not worth
less ; that the signatures. on the notes
are genuine?"
"I have not said so," quickly replied
Jolly. "Watch developments â ' in this
case. It is a peculiar affair. I know
of several interesting points in the case
and I could answer the majority of
your questions, but I will not do it- I
am determined to remain silent in con
nection with all the troubles of the
Chadwick family."

HALL WRECKED
BY DEPUTIES
Interior of the Parliament
House Torn to Pieces by
the Opposition in Hungary
FIGHT WITH GUAKDS
Violent Scenes Enacted in
the Endeavor to Prevent
Opening of the Session
BUDAPEST, Dec. 13.â Violent as
have been the scenes at past sessions
of the Hungarian Parliament, they
have been entirely overshadowed by
the wreckage effected by members of
the Opposition party this morning in
their successful efforts to prevent the
opening of Parliament. A quarter of
an hour before 'the time appointed for
the commencement of business the Op
position mustered in full strength. Not
one of the Government's supporters
had arrived, and the Opposition had
the house to itself with the exception
of the personal guard of forty men pro
vided for the protection of the presi
dent, of the house. The presence of
these guards, who occupied the apj
proaches to the presidential platform,
seemed to inflame the Opposition Dep
uties, who in opprobrious terms shouted
at the "Hungarians who could perform
such shameful service."
The Deputies then approached the
platform and a scuffle with the guards
ensued. The Deputies fought their
way to the platform, tore it to pieces,
scattered the debris over the house,
tore to atoms the codes of law on the
president's table, smashed the tables
and chairs and destroyed the platform
and . distributed the broken pieces
among the Deputies, who, thus armed,
attacked the guards arrd after a brief
flght drove them from the house.
The desks were then torn down and
the interior of the house^, was almost
completely wrecked. None of the Lib
eral members ventured inside the
house, and the Opposition members,
after completing the ruin, established
themselves on the site erstwhile oc
cupied by the presidential rostrum.
The Liberals have been summoned to
a conference to decide on their course
of action. The sittings in both houses
of Parliament arranged for to-day
were postponed until to-morrow.
Minister of Justice Plosz had a con
ference to-nighrwith the Public Pros
ecutor and arranged for the prosecu
tion of the offending Deputies. It is
rumored that the troops will be held
in readiness provided with ball cart
ridges near the Parliament building
to-morrow and Premier Tizsa is said
to be determined to hold the sitting
under the protection of bayonets.

the Government, the indictment was
read and the prisoners were arraigned,
pleading Justifiable homicide, after
which the witnesses were examined.
BasonefC's apologia is declared to be
a remarkable document, showing the
prisoner to bÂ« a man of superior in
tellect and learning. It nils several
closely â¢ written pages, was drawn up
while he lay in the hospital and sets
forth the alms and purposes of the
Social revolutionary party, and the
fighting organization, the reasons and
motives for the murder of Minister von
Plehwe, and also his version of the
crime himself.
Toward night, when the shops and
factories were closed, the size of the
crowds increased and there were â¦oc
casional shouts of "Acquit them!" but
there was no attempt at an actual
demonstration. Only a few arrests
were made.

RESOLUTION A SURPRISE
Directs That Sufficient Men
Be Detailed to Insure
the End of the Traffic
The Board of. Police Commissioners
iaoved against the fortunes of the
white man last night by declaring that
he ffca'.I not do that which I*' denied
the </hine*e-pumie wealth through
the medium of lottery. A resolution,
well embellished with "whereases
*iated first that as Chinese lotteries
have been driven to the wall it is now
time to take up the fight against tne
whiu> lottery companies. After mak
ing thiF statement the resolution di
rected the Chief of Polite to ascertain
the addre.cÂ«s of all lottery companies
f.perating in this city and then to > de
tail sufficient policemen to insure their
FuprÂ»re5?ion. The resoluton came
without a warning with the result that
there will be a *curryinp for the shelt
er of the woods to-day.
It was stated by the commissioners
that th" lottery ticket peddlers have
become a nuisame and the companies
a menace to the rmÂ»ralsÂ»of the city.
Affentg of the companies*, it was said,
annoyed business men at-their labors,
stalked through the hotels and button
holed the pedestrian on the public
streevf. until now they must seek new
vocations.
Chief of Police Wittman said that ne
hart two detectives regularly detailed
rounding up the white lottery operat
or? Arrests were made every day. ha
continued, and the lottery people had
become Â«"> wen' that it was difficult
to prove a case against them.
TICKETS IX VAULTS.
Instead of maintaining regular
headquarters many of them now keep
their tickets in safe deposit vaults,
vhfir ivy canuct be reafb*d/ocly :â¢ -
moving enough each d^y to keep their
peddlers supplied and the peddlers took
care never to offer a ticket for sale in
the presence of an officer. To-day,
however, the raid on the white lotteries
will begin and interesting developments
ar^ awaited.
Patrolman John Edwards, who was
accused of arresting Andrew Bahrs
without cause, on a charge of disturb
ing the peace, while the latter was
walking down Powell street with his
wife, trail acquitted of the charge. It
was shosvn that the patrolman had act
ed properly. Bahrs' proved to be an
unwilling witness and asked permission
to withdraw the charge, but the com
mission was abdurate and insisted that
he proceed. He then told his story,
giving as his opinion that Patrolman
Edwards was drunk when he made the
arrest. Edwards denied the charge that
he had acted without warrant and
called several policemen to 'testify as
to hu; sobriety. The commission then
found in his favor.
COMMISSION" DIVIDED.
3n the matter of the charges that
Jtihn B. Morgan, proprietor of Morgan's
cafe, Eddy street, near Powell, was re
sponsible for the fact that a woman
sold iiquo-r without a license in the flat
on the third floor above the cafe, the
commission was divided. Commissioner
Howell said that he knew Mr. Morgan
conducted his cafe in an orderly man
ner and had always complied with the
rules of the commission. Hcrw, he said.
Mi. Morgan could be held responsible
for the acts of other tenants of the
building he could not see. The vote on
revocation was then abandoned, but the
question was put in issue on a motion
to renew the license of the cafe, which
expires on the 19th inst. Howell and
Drinkhouse voted in favor of the re
rewal of the license, but Reagan and
Hutton voted againet it. The question
will be taken up again at the next
meeting of the commission.
Robert Lass, who conducted a saloon
Et 8 Clay street and lost his license
through playing practical jokes on pat

New Library- and Museum and Agricultural
College to Cost a Big Sum. .
A marked advance toward the con
struction of the new University of
California was made by the Board of
Regents of that institution at a meet
ing held at the Hopkins Institute ol
Art yesterday afternoon. !
The Committee on Buildings and
Grounds filed a report with the board
recommending that work begin imme
diately on the construction of a library
and museum in accordance with the
plans of John Galen Howard, the uni
versity architect. These plans, it was
stated, were found to be highly satis
factory and In conformity with the
general scheme for the reconstruction
of the university buildings.
Though the library when completed
will cost in the neighborhood of $2,000.
000, only one wing will be constructed
in the immediate future at a cost ot
something over $600,000, of which more
than $100,000 is on hand and the rest
promised for the purpose. After some
discussion it was, decided to , resubmlt
the question of the construction of this
wins of the library to the Committee
on Buildings and Grounds . for the
further determination of the merits oi
the details of the Howard plans, and
then to place ite second report in the
hands of the Finance Committee for
definite action. From the statements
of members of the board yesterday it
is evident that this great work will
soon commence. .
Another recommendation was made
l.v the board that action be taken to
secure in the near future a building for
the agriculture department and the
purchase of a farm for the carrying on
of the practical work. that attaches to
this department.
PAKDEK PLACES L.1M1T.
Though it was stated that Governor
Paruee. in view of the many other
needs of the State, would not sanction
an appropriation larger than - fft>OjM0
for this building and farm. -thÂ« -com
mittee recommended that an appro
priation of $200,000 for the coj?. 4 "" 11 ""
of the building and one of tto 000 for
the purchase of a farm be applied for.
It was stated that the building will
be constructed on J.he university
grounds in conformity with the general
Plans, but just where a suitable farm
can be found remains to be determined.
The entire question was referred to the
Finance Committee.
The Finance Committee also naq
placed in its hands for final determina
tion a recommendation thaf $5000 be
appropriated for the construction of
suitable buildings at the forestry sta
tion at Santa Sionlea. The buildings
on the station lands, which were pre
sented to the university by ex-Senator
John P. Jones of Nevada, were recent
ly burned. It was also stated by -a
member of the board that if the laryls
now heia by the universary were not
satisfactory for the purpose .Senator
Jones will donate other lands in the
immediate vicinity. In view of this
new offer of Senatpr Jones . It . -paa de
cided that the question of,^appropria
tion should be put over until such, time
as the question of location can be de
termined. '. V ; â 
Another important question taken up
by the board was as to whether or not
the university should send its educa
tional exhibit from the St. Louis Ex
position to the Lewis and" Clark Cen
tennial Exposition, which will open at
Portland. Or., next year. â¢ President
Wheeler said that the exhibit had been
awarded -four grand prizes, one gold
medal and one silver medal by the St.
Louis Judges and he recommended
that the exhibit be sent north. After
some discussion it was agreed to sub
mit the question to the finance com
mittee, which will ask the Legislature,
which meets next month, to make an
appropriation for the purpose. . .
QUESTION OP SECRETARY.
The question of the appointment of
a secretary to thÂ« board waÂ»i next
taken up, and at the recommendation
of the finance committee, notwith
standing the protest of Regent Budd,
was allowed to remain as it now
stands. The finance committee . -said
that it thought it inexpedient at this
time to make any recommendation
and that the " present situation, with
an acting secretary doing the work,,
be permitted to prevail. Regent Buda
said that In his opinion it was illegal,
when the board had authoritv to ap
point a secretary at will, to permit
a so-called acting secretary to draw
the secretary's salary. His protest re
sulted in the auestlon being put to a
vote with the result that Budd was
supported by only one of hi* col
leagues, Elllnwood. It now ' looks, as
though the new year will be growing
old before this question is finally set-^
tied. . -â¢" ;
Regent Budd asked that the board
make an appropriation of $500 to carry
on experiments in flax culture in Cali
fornia, J-Jr. Budd said that â  experi
ments conducted at Stockton had de
termined that it could be grown here,
and that' If experiments demonstrated
that it -could be grown on a cqmtner*.
cial basis it would open a hew indus
try that would mean millions to- the
State. Professor HllgaM, he said,
had stated that flax was indigenous
to the State and could be grown any
where within its borders. The ques
tion will be finally determined at the
next meeting of the board. '.- \ ;
CAN' ESTABLISH HOSPITAL).
A communication from the attorney
of the board was received stating that
the desire of the faculty of the College
of Medicine of the university to re
ceive a fund for the establishment of
a hospital within; the, grounds of the
Affiliated Col'.Â«ges was entirely within
the law and that the board might ad
minister etich fund. As donations .for
such a purpose have been offered "it la
probable that within the near future
a hospital. will be established that will
enable the students of the college to
secure practical experience under the
direction of ' the . physicians that com
pose the faculty of .the college. : ;
In accordance with the recommenda
tion of President Wheeler the resigna
tion was. accepted of Dr. . Martin ,Â» H.
Fischer as assistant. professor of physi
ology, and Dr. John ,Bruce . MacCallum
was appointed assistant prof essor ., of
physiology in his place. '.'. â¢ â¢
R. E. Mansell, who has had much ex
perience as a landscape gardener In
England, was appointed gardener of
the collets of agriculture at a salary of
$75 per month, and was plven the use
of one. of the university cottages. .
Mrs.' Zelia Nuttall .was; appointed
fleld director of the Crocker-Reid re
search in Mexico, a work of anthro
pological Investigation. , which issup
ported .through , the aid -of -.Mrs. â¢ Wllr
Ham H. Crocker. of San Francisco . and
M rs. "SVhltelaw Reid of New 7 York. ;.
Resolutions were presented from 'the
farmers' institutes' at Willits, Napa

. thanking the university for farmers'

tion of institutes.
At his request -the title of Professor
E. H. Twight was changed from as
sistant professor of viticulture and
fermentative industries to lecturer -in

PRIVATE' SCHOOLS TAXED.
Upon the recommendation of Presi
dent Wheeler the board decided to
amend its code bo as to provide that
every private school of the State shall
be charged a uniform fee of $3 for
examination by the university authori
ties as to its right for a place on tha
list of accredited schools. Heretofore
the private schools of San Francisco,
Oakland and Alameda have been ex
empted from the payment of this fee.
This fee is apart from the expenses ofÂ«
the examiner, which will also ; be
charged against the school examined
for listing:. The attorney of the board
was directed . to draw up an- amend
ment of the code in accordance with
thhi decision.
In order to conform with the recent
ly adopted code of the Regents, a com
mittee appointed for the purpose rec
ommended that the standing commit
tees be reorganized .and recommended
that thpy be appointed as follows:

J. E. Bolger, cashier of the Shipown

was- held up and robbed last night bv
two masked men just inside the Pre

him of a gold watch and $7 In coins.
One of the robbers held a pistol to
Bolger' b head and ordered him to hold
up his hands. The other, who wore the
cap and blouse of a eoldier. searched
his pockets. ' Bolger had a good look at
the thief in civilian's clothes and is cer
tain that he could identify him.
Bolger was walking along Fourth
avenue to his home near the Golf Club
when the command "Hands uo!" ran*
out. Two men stepped out of the shrub
bery ' and a big revolver ' was leveled
at Bolger's head. He obeyed the order.
The man in the soldier's uniform
quickly stepped* behind him and ,uro
ceeded to turn hia pockets inside' out.
"Shall I take- his watch?" aaked the
man In uniform. '
"Take everything he has." said the
man. with the revolver. Bolsrer asked
them to leave his fob, which j was pre
sented to him by the Olympic Club.
"Well, all right," said the man with
the pistol. "We couldn't do much with
that."
5 "I'll leave the. fob in your overcoat
pocket." said the thug in uniform.
After a thorough search of the pock
ets both robbers disappeared Into the
Presidio forest.
As soon as Bolger reached home he
called up Captain of Detectives Burnett
and made a report of the matter. At
first it was understood that the-hold
up had occurred in the club and Detec
tives Bell and Armstrong were detailed
to investigate. After reaching the
Presidio the officers were Informed of
the location of the hold-up and started
their Investigation. Though the offi
cers searched the neighborhood until
a late hour last night no arrests have
been made. -

They consist of massive rocks with
huge spires jutting up hundreds of
feet. These rocks In comparison with
their great height are narrow and are
in reality gigantic pillars of storie.
The /'Pinnacles" are gorgeously/col

BROUGHT DEAD
BACK TO LIFE
Ifather Ignatius in London
Tells of Miracles He Says
He Has Performed in Past
POWERS OF A RELIC
Claims^ Part of Original
Cross" Has Aided Him in
Bringing About Wonders
Special Cable to The Call and New. York
Herald. Copyright. 1004, by the New Torli
Herald Publishing Company.
LONDON, Dec. 13. â Continuing his
avowal, of the faith whereby all things
are possible with God to-day as they
â were In the past, even to the healing
of the sick and the raising of the
dead, Father Ignatius to-day proceed
ed to recount to a representative of
the Daily Express various occasions
upon which he has performed what
he, calls miracles. â¢ One notable occa
sion was in the year 1862, when he
and a fellow' worker named Redman
were awakened one night by a wom
an, who earnestly besought Father Ig
natius to come out and save her
daughter,, who was dying of typhoid.
"Suddenly," said Father Ignatius, "I
felt the command of our Lord upon me
and I rose up. All I said to my ,f riend
was/ 'Do bring your relic With you.'
He had a wonderful, beautiful relic,
a piece of wood of the true cross.
."When we reached the house the girl
was dead. She had been dead two
hours and her body was already com
posed for. burial. Upon an involuntary
impulse, however, which I felt _to be
inspired, I took the relic of the cross
from my friend and laid it upon the
dead girl's, breast. Then I cried, 'In
the name of Jesus Christ, I say unto
thee, arise.' â - ,
"Slowly and stiffly the^corpse arose
in the bed and Redman, turning to me,
cried, 'What have you done?'
" 'I have done - nothing,' I â¢ replied,
'but the Lord, hath done great things,
indeed.' " â¢ . . .
After this Father Ignatius harked
back to the first time when the word
of the Lord came upon him. This was
at Plymouth, where a mother declined
to allow her children to be baptized.
Father Ignatius told her the curse of
God would fall upon her and wilnin
an hour the curse fell. Suddenly, with
out warning, the woman's fourteen
year-old daughter was stricken with
idiocy and her whole body broke out
from head to foot with most loathsome
sores. But Father Ignatius cured her
at the Lord's command.
At another time, he says, he
sprinkled water on a man crushed be
neath a falling stone and the/ man
walked to his home. ,.'
FIGHT BETWEEN NEGROES
AND WIIITES IN PASADENA
Colored Man Tears Down Sign Posted
by Easterners and Incipient
Race War Results.
PASADENA, Dec. 13. â A small race
war was precipitated here to-day when
the Tourist Club, composed of
"sporty" Easterners, posted a sign,
"These grounds are for white - mem
bers only." Ben Holmes, a negro,
tore the sign down, claiming It was an
insult to his race. 1 A free fight, which
the police stopped before blood was
shed, was the result of Holmes' action.
The negro was heavily fined In the
Police Court.
Rumors of. Naval Disasters.
LONDON, Dec. 14.â The Dally Tele

and of the sinking of two Russian tor

FEARS ASSAULT
ON ORIENTALS
Placer County Farmer Says
Eoseville Ranchers Intend
to Disturb Tenants' Peace
APPEALS TO GOVEKXOK
Complainant Declares That
Japanese and Chinese Are
to Be Driven From Lands
Special Dds^ateh to ThÂ« Call.
SACRAMENTO, Dec. 13.â L. L. King,
a rancher of Roseville. Placer Count,y.
called on Governor . Pardee to-day to
complain of the alleged intention of a
number of residents of Roseville to ex
pel the Japanese ' renters from his
ranch and to drive all the Japanese and
Chinese from that section. King said
the Japanese on his place had armed
themselves and were prepared to fight.
Governor Pardee told the rancher he
would urge the Sheriff of Placer Coun
ty to protect the lives and property of
the Orientals. It Is said the Japanese
Consul in San Francisco has been ap
pealed <4o by King.
The ranchers of Roseville recently
held a large and representative meet
ing. It was orderly and not at all
warlike. It passed a single resolution,
one denouncing the employment of Jap
anese or Chinese as Inimical to the
welfare of Roseville, and appointed a
committee to present the resolution to
employers of Japanese or Chinese and
ask their support to the movement.
Another meeting Is called for Friday
night. Roseville people say there is
not the slightest cause for Kln^s fears
and are astonished that he should have
appealed to the Governor.

â¦HELP ME OUT
This is My Last Day, and the
Prices I'll Give on a Piano
Will Run Your Hand
Into Your Pocket.
/ V
Have Several Specials Held Out
for My Last Day as
Teasers.
Among Which is an Elaborate
Steinway for Next to
Nothing.
How on earth can I sell twenty-
pianos to-day? I have failed to sell ail
of the 130 pianos of the "Weber line"
turned over to me to dispose of in
thirty days. Twenty new ones are left
yet. and this Is my last day. It would
be easy, awful easy. If the good people
: of San Francisco only knew, or could
; be brought to realize the exact situa-
tion as it Is here in this sale.
No fairer deal was ever attempted,
or lower prices ever given, than I have
made and maintained throughout this
sacriflco bale.
I have sold "Weber" pianos 1325 bÂ«-
low their fair worth, and regular re-
tail price. I have sold "Wheelock"
pianos (belonging to the "Weber line,
and built by the Pianola' Weber con-
cern) |l?0 below their standard price
everywhere. I have sold the "8tuy-
vesant" piano as much as $137 below
their average retail price. The beaut: -
tfful "Scheffer" piano (than which
there Is mighty few its equal) has suf-
fered likewise, and went at $160 to $213
below what they are worth, and regu-
larly sell for.
Tha "Bradford" shared the samÂ«
fate, and were sold $160 below their
standard price everywhere.
All these, and others, were cut right
down practically to cost, and soma
even bflow it, which means much
more than individual piano buyers who
have not investigated can possibly
realize. t
I have about twenty very fine new
pianos of the above makes â mostly of
the higher-priced styles â at the same
; desperate rates to-day; in fact, soma
will be hacked even more. I want to
make a clean sweep â but it would seem
Impossible; still, there's hope. I can
only say that any man or woman who
buys a piano of me between this ar.Â«l
11 o'clock to-night (at which time this
sale ends) will have saved at least $160,
and in many cases as much as $240, on
their piano.
I have several piano bargains to-
day: even better than that on pianos
that show some Â«light mar on varnish
through handling, or unboxing, and on
those I'll know no cost; they've simply
got to go.
Terms on anything in stock to-day â
: outside of a few of the costliest Webers
' â will be $2"Â» down and $10 per month
; (except two secDnd-hand uprights, and
they can go at most any old priceâ $1>
down and $6 per monthâ ho room for
these). Webers. $50 down and $1>
monthly â at cost. Don't hesitate or
delay, but come at once to 126 Geary
street (opposite the City of Paris dry
goods store), for it is your last chance
to buy a piano without lining up some
dealer's pocket with a good round
profit. ", ,- -
Store open till 11 o'clock- to-night, at
which time I don't want to see an un-
sold piano in It. A- A. FISHER.

INDIAN WOMAN
UNDER ARREST
Carlisle Girl Accused; of Burglarij
"With a charge of burglary against
her, Mrs. Minna Parpltt, a half-breed
Cherokee Indian and a graduate of the
CarllEle School for Indians, is held at
the City Prison. She is accused of en
tering a room at 827 Howard street and
after extracting $35 from a purse that
â¢was placed under the lodger's pillow,
turning on the gas to asphyxiate her
victim. The roomer >vas Peter Kou
louritis and he was rescued frern the
improvised death chamber in an un
conscious condition.
Koulouritis was taken to the Central
Emergency Hospital, where he fought
death from the effects of the deadly
fumes for an entire day. "When he re
covered consciousness he asked a friend
to go to his room and get the $35 which
he had left under his pillow. The money
could not be found.
Two fellow lodgers, Labrcs Voulgarls
and Peter Pagonis. claim that they saw
Mrs. Parpitt hovering near the room
where Koulouritis was found asphyxi
ated and afterward they say they saw
her in the man's room.
The Indian woman was pointed out
to Policeman J. A. Ryan yesterday by
the two men. She was arrested and
booked at the Southern station for
burglary. Koulourl is is certain that
she robbed him and then tried to cover
up the crime by turning cm the gas and
leaving him to die.
At the City Prison the woman was
at first communicative and conversed
freely and intelligently. Later she be
came sullen and lapsed into the dogged
sullenness characteristic of the Indian
nature. She stalked back to her cell
with the light stride of a true daughter
of the tepee.
The prisoner gave the following ac
count c-f herself: "I was born in In
dian Territory. My father was an
American, my mother a Cherokee. I
graduated from the Carlisle School and
went to Los Angeles, where I married
Manuel Pan Itt. I did not rob this man
nor did I try to murder him. It is a
plot against me."
The husband was arrested on a
vagrancy charge and the police are
looking up the record of the pair. Mrs.
Parpitt has been employed at a Pacific
street music hall.

HALF BLOOD CHEROKEE WOMAN, A
GRADUATE OF CARLISLE. WHO IS ,
CHARGED WITH BURGLARY.
CHILD SUFFERS
FROM NEGLECT
Starving to death, her little body torn
and bruised from continual beating,
four-year-old Margaret Connors was
taken to the Central* Emergency Hos
pital last night in a precarious condi
tion. To Dr. Glover, the wan little
child told a pitiful tale of abuse and
mistreatment.
The child's mother died a year and a
half ago.
The baby, up to a few days ago; was
in charge of her aunt, Mrs. Emma Con
nors pf Vallejo. Her. father, Henry
Connors, a teamster In this city, took
her from his sister last week.
Connors placed his little girl in the
care of Mrs. Mamie Clark of 314 Third
street. Last night Mrs. Clark became
alarmed at the child's emaciated ap
pearance and weakened condition and
sent for the ambulance.
When the pale little waif was exam
ined at the hospital Dr. Glover discov
ered that Margaret was suffering from
tuberculosis and a debilitated condition
of the system. Her body from the waist
up was denuded of large spots of skin.
On quizzing the patient the surgeon
was told a pitiful tale, the child declar
ing that some one in Vallejo had con
tinually beaten her with a board
studded with nails. The marks on the
girl's body appeared to bear mute evi
dence of her pathetic story. Little
Margaret said that she was hungry.
When given food she ate it ravenously.
Her hunger satisfied, the child turned
to the strangers around her and called
for her aunt.
Later in the evening another aunt,
who had accompanied Mrs. Clark to the
hospital, took Margaret away, saying
that she would see that she was prop
erly cared for. The father lives at 303
Third street, but could not be located
last night. The aunt who took the
baby said that she had knowledge of
the mistreatment the child had received
in Vallejo, but refused to discuss the
subject.
Dr. Glover says the child is In a
serious condition and its recovery Is
doubtful. â¢ T- ;v *C

FARWELL TALKS
ON MUSIC OF
THE NEW TIME
Mr. Arthur Farwell, who last night
lectured at Century Hall oh - /'Ameri
can Music and the Development : of In
dian Melodies." brilliantly proved his
point as to the large musical! value ' of
the- Indian . themes. ' Mr.i Farwell's Jtalk
took in the consideration of music as
it is now made in America and^the
possible Indian sources, for. its 'future
inspiration, and was admirably illus
trated by.Jthe lecturer ,bbth. on -the
piano and . the . violin: Mr. Earwell was
introduced by Mr. Frank < P. j Deering,
who invited particular, attention to the
lecturer as the founder' of the Wa-Wan
Press, "which is rapidly - earning fame
as. the publishing channel of a new and
vigorous school of the younger Ameri
can -composers, f 'â¢â -*â  .,..,_ ;.
"The lecturer began by expressing his
belief that we now , at the begin
ning of the creative -epoch in Ameri
can â¢ music. Heretofore .the musical
expression-, has been imitative, . but
there is now a strong body of young I
composers doing the thing revolution
ary and at the same time significant
and beautiful. That this; new expres
sion should find, its way to. the people
the Wa-Wan Press was founded, and
has already published many important >
compositions. Some striking examples!
of, the Indian ' folk-songs were . then j
given, with most picturesque- stories of'
their origin. Songs of love, of war, of
death were all exampled, richly Illus
trating a literature that seems prac
tically unlimited in .Its suggestion to
the musician. One wonders, Indeed, so
striking Is the resemblance. If one of
the' themes did not wander, over to!
Bayreuth while Wagner was at work
on the "Rheingold!" The particular
song is the "Love Song of an Old I
Man." once sung by an old Indian I
every morning at dawn from a hill top. J
It is plainttveness. longing, gentle sad
ness incarnate and charmingly me- 1
lodious. The "Ghost Dance." the "Song j
of Peace." the "Song of the Leader."]
a chorale sung to the departing spirit, j
and others were given, an proving
beautiful in the largest sense and thor- I
oughly characteristic. They were |
played by Sir. Farwell on the piano i
and on the violin, in which latter case |
the lecturer was accompanied by Miss
Hulda Andersen. . !
The third part of the lecture was
given over to the rendering of four
compositions for piano, founded upon
Indian themes, by Mr. Farwell. Much i
the most interesting of these is the!
"Domain of Hurakan," the Wind God. '
In which there are many passages of
remarkable beauty and originality.
Chopin is somewhat , suggested, Wag
ner also, but there is notable original
strength, much native poetry and pic
turesqueness to be found therein. In
dian, thoroughly, and that way fas
cinating, are the Ichlbuzzl "War Cry"
and the Navajo "War Dance." The
"Dawn" again has strongly the poetic!
quality, is full of color and is firmly j
built. The composer shows a rich har- ,
monic sense throughout. To-morrow ,
evening the following programme will j
be given at Lyric Hall, representative ;
of the younger American composers. ;
None of the works have been given â 
here before. Mr. Farwell will be as- i
sisted therein by Miss Helen Colburn 1
Heath, soprano; Miss Hulda Andersen, j
piano; Mr. Frederick Maurer, piano; i
and Professor Carlos Troyer, piano. |

BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
Fnrland | Shows Genius.
Somebody leaving Stelnway Hall
last night softly hummed "De banjo
am de Instrument for me," and all
who attended the recital by Alfred A.
â¢Farland heartily â¢ indorsed the senti
ment. His was not the banjo of the
plantation, coupled with black-face
minstrelsy, rag-time and knock-about
turns, .but from the once-despised in
strument he drew forth genuine
music; delicate tones which held the
audience breathless, and louder vibra
tions which made one almost wonder
if an orchestra were not concealed
bfhlnd the curtain. .
Mr. - Farland's repertoire included
classical selections, popular mefodies
and some lively airs. Farland holds
the title of the. world's greatest banjo
ist. He" is certainly a wizard with his
favorite Instrument. Many of the
numbers rendered by Farland last
night were especially arranged by him
self and in them he showed the hand
of a master.
Mr. Farland was ably assisted , by
Alice Kellar-Fox. who not only accom
panied him with "the banjo in Instru
mental selections, but also rendered
seme choice vocal numbers. , 1
Mr. Farland I? billed to appear at
thf- Orpheum next week and it Is pre
dicted-that .'he:' will make a great hit
there. .

Stranger With Plenty, of Time and
"; ''â  3Ioncy Sees the. Sights and
â¢ ' Pays Good Price.
â¢ â , The fame of; San Francisco's at
tractions Jj for sightseers is likely to
be enlarged by the victim of;a prac
tical 'if somewhat expensive joke per
petrated jtwo years ago by the owner
of a' small steam launch. The story
came out yesterday in Judge Hunt's
court 1 during the trial of the case of
Robert' ' Farrelly against Joseph and
Louis : Parente for 15150- damages for
malicious' prosecution.- Farrelly was
on lV -e;stand and was being examined
as to certain, payments he had made
to the-builder of his launch, Robert F.
He said that on one date he paid an
installment of-J35.
j "Where did you get the. money?"
asked -the attorney. '

NEWS OF THE COUNTY OF ALAMED A
CONTRA COSTA COMPANY
OUT OF POLITICS.
William J. Dingee Says
This Is Verdict.
NO LONGER LOCAL ISSUE
OAKLAND, Dec. 13.â William J. Din
gee, .president of the Contra Costa Wa
ter Company, said to-day that his com
pany was completely out of politics,
and that It would do nothing to in
fluence the approaching city election.
Ab the Contra Costa Water Company
has been the storm center of politics in
Oakland for twenty years,* and as its
attorney_ stated in San Francisco only
yesterday that Oakland was composed
entirely of politicians, this statement Is
of interest.
This it what Mr. Dingee said to-day
about politics and the campaign that
will open next month:
"The Contra Costa Water Company
will have nothing to do with politics.
TRUSTEES MOVE
TO STOP CRIME
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call
2148 Center street, Dec. 13.
More than a score of applications
h&ve been made to Marshal Kerns for
the positions created by the Town
Trustees last night, when they author
ized the Marshal of Berkeley to appoint
four new deputies. The new men are
to go on duty December 15, but thus
far Marshal Kerns has announced no
et-leetions.
Crime in the college town is expected
to decrease materially when the force
of peace officials is thus augmented.
During the last two weeks citizens
have been startled by a succession of
reports of outrages perpetrated by
tafe- breakers, hold-up men and such
degenerates as the stranger who as
saulted Bertha Condon, a schoolgirl,
last Friday and dragged her for three
miles along the Santa Fe Railroad
track.
Ordinarily the college town is peace
ful, with little to disturb its academic
calm. There are no saloons in the
place and the jail is not usually popu
lated. Gambling is not permitted and
there are no disorderly houses.
Marshal Kerns exercised diligence
and is considered Â«to have done all that
his office with its staff of three men
cculd be expected to do. When he de
clared to the Town Trustees that more
men should be employed to suppress
and prevent crime In the city he was
conceded to be reasonable in his re
quest for assistance. The Town Trus
ttes" action followed and with this en
larged staff patroling Berkeley there
will no doubt be less of crime.

ALAMEDA DOES
NOT LIKE BILL
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1016 Broadway, Dec. 13.
The county division bill, as pre
pared by a committee of the Merchants'
Exchange, was the subject of a con
ference to-night by the exchange direc
tors, members of the State Legislature
and residents of Oakland and of Ala
meda. George W. Arper of the ex
change admitted that the purpose of
the proposed act was to open the wajl
for a campaign for consolidation off
Oakland, Alameda and Berkeley, bur
he denied that any attempt was to be
made in this direction at once.
Among those at the meeting were
State Senators F. W. Leavltt, G. W.
Lukens and M. W. Simpson and As
semblymen W. H. Waste, P. M. Walsh
and J. J. Burke. These legislators sat
discreetly silent while representatives
from Oakland and Alameda discussed
what they wanted. Alameda was rep
resented by former State Senator E. K.
Tayior. Major C. L. Tilden. C. R.
Smith, U. C. Hanks. George Renner.
H. G. Mehrtens, D. J. McCarthy and
Rev. Dr. Brande*.
The exchange presented to all pres
ent copies of the proposed bill for coun
ty division and then C. R. Smith of
Alameda asked that his district- be
heard from. Major Tilden and J E. K.
Taylor both said that Alameda had no
desire to join with Oakland; that they
could carry their bond elections, while
Oakland could not; and If Oakland
wanted to be a city and county gov
ernment all by itself, Alameda was
perfectly willing, but it was not will
ing to be drawn into a distasteful al
liance.
Senator Leavltt asked what benefit
the passage of the bill would be a'nd
stated that so far as he could see the
mere dividing of the county would be
of no value, for after that was done
another law would have to be passed
allowing the city to form a city and
county government or for several cities
to consolidate and form a city and
county government. This was the only
expression made by any legislator.
Director George Arper stated in ex
planation that a general discussion of
the bill had not been contemplated at
the present time, as it was not pro
posed to ask the members of the Legis
lature any questions but to lay before
them their views upon the matter as
far as they had gone, but if the pro
posed bill passed there would be a
campaign for county division begun at
once.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Dec. 13.
The trial of the suit of the Niehaus
Bros. Company of Berkeley against
the Contra Costa Water Company for
8141,050 S2 damages as the result of
a fire which destroyed their planing
mill In West Berkeley in August, 1901,
was begun to-day before Judge Ells
worth. The plaintiffs allege that there
was no pressure in the pipes on the
night of the fire and that owing to a
lack of water the mill was destroyed.
The basis of the action is the claim
made by Niehaus Bros, that they had
seven hydrants placed in different
parts of the mill, known as the West
Berkeley Planing Mill, under special
arrangements with the water \ com
pany that a pressure of at least fifty
pounds would be maintained in the
pipes, and this was considered to be
sufficient to protect the mill. Each
night the water ,was turned on by the
night watchman from a hydrant in
the street so as to.be ready In case of
need, but on the night in question it
is alleged that the water would bare
ly run out of the end of the hose.
Maps of the building and the gen
eral location of it were introduced by
Attorney W. S. Goodfellow, represent
ing the plaintiffs, to-day, and this af
ternoon the night watchman took the
stand and told of the discovery of the
fire by him and the giving of the
alarm. The water company is repre
sented by Attorney Knight of the
firm of Page, McCutcheon & Knight
of San Francisco and M. C. Chapman
of this city. '

over the arch of the plattorm garlands
of smilax were woven into love-knots
and graceful festoons.
At the back of the platform twenty
eight waxen tapers blazed and in the
center of the room a huge birthday
cake, in a wreath of .poinsettias and
bearing twenty-eight tiny red candles,
occupied a post of honor.
Mrs. E. J. Cotton was chief hostess,
and under her direction was given a
fine musical programme, preceding
which Mrs. J. B. Hume, the club's
president, made a few introductory re-"
marks that were heartily applauded.
Mrs. Hume is eloquent at all time*,
and her references to the high aims of
the club and her appeal to the mem
bers to keep ever In view the high
standard they had raised â the standard
of pure womanly worth and culture â
were marked by characteristic grace
and force.
Amon Cain, a barytone formerly with
the Castle Square Opera Company, fa
vored the assembled clubwomen with
a varied selection of songs,' including
an aria by Donizetti and another from
"The Barber of Seville." Mrs. Nunan
of San Francisco sang two beautiful
songs, one being by Dr. H. J. Stewart,
whose pupil she is. Mrs. Nunan was a
vision in a rose pink gown and big
white picture hat. Her voice is a so
prano of rare ' sweetness and purity.
Another pleasing musical number was a
CLERK MISSING
AND COIN GONE
Thomas.. Breham, chief clerk of the
Hotel Auditorium, disappeared Satur
day night, and with him are missing
funds belonging to the hotel. Playing
the races Is alleged to be the cause of
his downfall. Breham had been for
two years the rusted employe of
Laurence McKenna, the proprietor of
the hotel.
McKenna first went into the hotel
as night clerk. He soon proved hlm
selt so efficient that he was promoted
to chief day clerk, where he was given
much responsibility. ' He became pop
ular with the guests,^ especially the
members of the racing contingent who
lived at the house. About two
months ago McKenna found that
new interests would occupy his time,
and he practically turned over the
management of the Auditorium to
Breham. He, however, came to the
hotel every morning to check up- the
cash. Gradually it dawned upon him
that the receipts were falling off. .
Last Saturday . morning McKenna
noticed there\was a big falling off, and
v;hen he returned at 10 o'clock at
night, Breham had disappeared. So
far examinations of the books show a
shortage of about $500. 'How much
larger the amount will be cannot be
.ascertained- until the books have been
: thoroughly examined.
McKenna says that Breham seldom
went to the race tracks,' but that he
has discovered that he haunted the
resorts where pools were sold.
Breham had been quietly removing
his effects' from the hotel for some ten
days before -his departure, and when
he finally took hlB leave he carried a
dress suit case and an overcoat, which
he told the night clerk he was taking
to the ferry for a friend.
The police have beeit notified^

BERKELEY. Dec. 13. â Work was
begun to-day under the direction of
Manager Jules Kuester upon a project
which, eventually is to change the tel

subscribers, instead ' of being obliged
to call for "Danas" and "Stuarts" and
"Derbys" and other prefixes when
asking for a number, will simply ask
for- "Berkeley." The change is ex

SHIPPING BILL
TO BE URGED
Special Dispatch to The Call,
CALL BUREAU. HOTEL BARTON,
WASHINGTON, _Dec. 13.-A final
agreement on the. ship-subsidy bill has
been t reached by the commission of Sen
ators and Representatives who investi
gated this question' during the recess
of Congress. The report of the com
mission is also nearing completion and
both the bill and the report will prob
ably be presented before the adjourn
ment for the holidays.
In spite of the stamp of disapproval
put on this measure by Speaker Can
non and other House leaders, who were
urging economy, the friends of the
measure are planning to make a vig
orous campaign in its behalf and de
clare that Democratic opposition in
Senate and House has very largely dis
appeared.
The principal features of the bill In
clude mail subventions and rebates of
tonnage taxes. The new bill elimi
nates the question of preferential or
differential duties. The commission,
after an investigation of this feature,
decided that It was not practicable. It
was found that there could be no plan
for a direct subsidy drawn up that
would not conflict with from thirty to
forty commercial treaties, which would
be likely to arouse retaliatory legisla
tion. It is on the new mail routes,
with a very generous speed maximum
and an alternative subvention, that the
new bill is founded. The vessels which
do not care to undertake mall contracts
are allowed the alternative of the em
ployment of a certain percentage of
American sailors belonging to the navy
reserve â about one-eighth.
It is not certain just what will be
the amount of money involved. It is
estimated that the rebate on the ton
nage tax. may reach 55,000,000. In the
case of the Pacific lines running to the
Orient and the Pan-America mall sub
ventions it may amount to between
$1,500,000, and $2,000,000. iNo estimates
have yet been made for the Atlantic.
It is expected that the Pacific Mail,
with its lines running to China and
Japan, will get about $500,000 and prob
ably $250,000 on its lines to the Isthmus.
It Is purposed to raise the rate of the
tonnage tax. That now being charged
by the United States Is lower than any
other countjy charges on foreign bot
toms. This sum, which is now turned
into the treasury and is going to the
marine hospital service, the lighthouse
service and the like, will thus be gVeat
ly Increased and will be equally dis
tributed among American ships. >-â¢-

ARE YOU SICK?
If so, where?
Headache?
Dry. hacking cough?
Foul tongue?
Less of appetite? â¢
Lcck of energy?
Pain In stomach?
General weakness?
These are but a few of the signs of
lr digestion.
Some others are: Wind In the stom-
ach cr bowels; comUpaUon or dlar-
rr.ea; pale complexion; spots before the
*->es; dizziness; loss of flesh; irritabil-
ity; sleeplessness; nervousness.
All these symptoms will plague and
torment you. -and will never perma-
nently leave you, once you suffer from
them; only are sure. In time, to get
worse, if not treated by the best known
scientific method of cureâ Stuart's
dyspepsia Tablets.
These curative tablets are composed
of ir.grredients which modern knowledge
of the true inward processes of diges-
tion approve of. as forming the best,
safest, surest and most scientific com-
bination of medicinal drugs that can
be used to relieve all the conditions of
l!'-health brought on by this much-
dreaded disorder.
A disease so "protean" or changeable
la its manifestations, assuming so
many forms, characterized by so many
different symptoms that, more times
than not. it is mistaken for s'ome other
â  disease altogether, and the poor patient
may die, or at best allow the seeds of
. permanent, chronic sickness to germ-
inate and take root in his system.
. So it ls a real danger we ask you to
avoid, when we say: In case of doubt,
take Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.
Even if disordered digestion ls not
the real cause of your sickness (which,
probably, though, it ls), yet your di-
gestion is nearly certain to be out of
order, and If allowed to remain so will
seriously complicate your sickness for
you.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, then, will
bÂ» sure to do you good, and will not
interfere with any other medicine you
may be taking.
They will help to make your food
make you strong, and thus, if in no
other way. help you back to health by
helping your system to throw off dis-
ease like a healthy duck shakes water
off Its back.
Shake off your sickness with Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets.

He Shocks Dance Hall Usage
i
Objects When Taxed for Liquids
Which He Did Not Consume
BY JAMES C CRAWFORD.
When he started from his native
town, Columbus, O., to tour the west
ern seaboard young Byron Collier had
been warned to 'ware breakers and
shoals along the Barbary Coast of San
Francisco, which forewarning may
have been explanatory of his posses
sion of a Etout club when he sauntered
into a Pacific-street dance hall last
Saturday night. Ke was also equipped
with reliable Information anent the
*â¢ !â¢
tricks and devices employed in such
places to dissociate the unsophisti
cated traveler from his ready money
and It was with the confidence of a
seasoned habitue that he Ignored alike;
the blandishments of the sirens and
the rougher overtures of their mascu
line consorts, firmly declining either to
trip a two-steD or purchase liquids.
But not until the man behind the bar
began to regard him with baleful eye
did Mr. Collier realize that the estab
lishment was not maintained for the
purpose of providing inquisitive tour
ists with gratuitous glimpses of the
under world and that his refusals to
spend money actually put him in the
light of an intruder.
Shocked by the realization he has
tened to order for himself one glass of
beer, in payment for which~he tendered
a J3 gold piece, having no coin of
smaller denomination. The foaming
beverage was placed before him, the
golden disk withdrawn from his gaze,
and as he sipped and waited for his
change he was rather surprised to see
how suddenly the business of the bar
picked up. Every one in the place
seemed to have been abruptly seized
with a thirst that would not be denied.
Men and women flocked from all parts
of the house and ranged themselves
along the counter until they were lined
up two deep, and the mixologist sum
moned an assistant to aid him in serv
ing them. Even the orchestra, com
posed of piano, cornet and snare drum,
ceased torturing the atmosphere and
augmented the bibulous throng. What
also struck Mr. Collier as somewhat
remarkable was his meteoric rise in
popularity. Ere tipping their glasses
the thirsty ones favored him with
friendly nods and drank to his per
petual retention of good health. The
ladies, as a rule, said: "Here's happy
days, kiddo," while the men varied the
toast by exclaiming: "How. young fel
ler" and "Lookin' at ye, kid."
When the crowd had been served
and the barman was leisurely washing
and wiping glassware Mr. Collier ex
pressed desire to get the J4 95 for
which he had courteously waited until
the rush subsided, but, instead of the
money, he was given an intimidatory
glare accompanying the Information
that beer equivalent in value to the
entire V had been consumed by those
whom he had invited to drink with
him. Mr. Collier endeavored to explain
that he had not invited any one, but
his explanation went for naught, and
he was requested to walk out and thus
avoid being thrown out. A hostile
demonstration with his club brought
upon him like a pack cf wolves the
very folk who a few moments pre
viously had pledged him in white
topped beakers, and he was compelled
to smite several of them to the floor
ere he could make his exit. With the
pack in full cry at his heels he ran
down the street and was probably
saved from serious bodily Injury by
Patrolmen Skaln and Holmes, one of
whom held the mob at bay while the
other arrested the pursued one for car
rying a deadly weapon, the same being
a club.
"I have discovered," said Mr. Collier
to Police Judge Mogan, "that Just as
soon as I placed the $5 on the counter
the bartender surreptitiously touched
an electric button that summoned all
the people in the place to step up and
drink."
He was given till next Saturday to
make and report further startling dis
coveries.

as more in accord with the majesty
oJ the court. This opinion was warm
ly contested by Mr. Conlan, who held
that grreen without trimmings has
boen the hue universally accepted as
emblematic of justice since time im
memorial. To which Mr. Carmichael
retorted that in this progressive nation
and age the dispensation of unadulter
ated Justice is not dependent upon
recognition of any accompanving
color.
"An* sae far as thot gangs," he
added, "theer's nae gude reason why
green should be chosen ony mair thon
red or blue."
"D'ye railly think so?" Mr. Conlan
inquired.
"Xae gude reason at a'," Mr. Car
michael repeated.
"Sure an' it's a wondher," said Mr.
Conlan. with fine irony, "that you
don't ricommend a bunch o' thistles
with your Macgrigor plaid."
"Aweel. mon," sighed Mr. Carmich

"Ye don't, don't ye? Well, that's
not all ye dlnna ken," Mr. Conlan
exclaimed.
The debate was waxing acrimonious
when Judge Cabaniss. uninfluenced by
racial predilection and striking for
peace, asked the carpet dealer if he
could obtain a pattern showing this

and the dealer surprised all present
by declaring that he could and would.
He- did, and that's how. the carpet in
Department Xo. 4 came to be alluded
to as "the Cabaniss compromise."
Judge Fritz dismissed the felony
embezzlement charge against Miss
I-ena Walton, recently of Alaska, who
was accused by Max Gutter of having
sold to him for $1000 an interest in
a gold mine'which she had previously
disposed of. The testimony against
the woman was insufficient to warrant
her commitment.
Judge Mogan continued till to
morrow the preliminary examination
of Joseph Smith, who shot and" killed
Joseph HcGoTan about three weeks
ago. The continuance was granted on
motion of District Attorney Byington.
who desired to lead the prosecution in
person and was engaged in another
murder trial in the Superior Court.
Attorney D. J. Murphy, for the de
fense, interposed no objection.
"Katie Synfy!" shouted the bailiff,
and instead of the female person ex
pected to respond there was placed be
fore Judge Conlan a stout and heavily
bearded man of swart complexion.
When asked his name he displayed two
glistening rows of molars and said.
"Katie Synfy." Then it was explained
that he first saw light in Turkey and
since his arrival in San Francisco,
about two years ago, had peddled
fruit and vegetables for a livelihood. It
was for driving his wagon at excessive
speed on Market street, near Second,
that he was arrested by Patrolman
Galloway after he had given that ener
getic policeman a long chase and a
fierce combat.
When the policeman saw the ped
dler whipping his horse while- the ani
mal was approaching a thronged cross
ing: at a high rate of speed he raised
an admonitory club and shouted
"Halt'" But the command was ig
nored and the stped dashed onward.
The officer caught and clung to the
tailboard of the vehicle until he was
enabled to scramble aboard, when he
laid a restraining hand upon the driver
and asrain ordered him to halt. In an
instant the wagon was transformed
into a theater of active conflict. The
policeman pulled the driver backward,
and both fell to the wagon-bed, where
they wrestled amid fruit and vegeta
bles until they were thickly covered
with vari-colored pulp, and the terrible
Turk was finally subdued. It is doubt
ful, however, that Galloway could have
conveyed his prisoner to the Central
station If Patrolman Roach had not
aided him.
"You gave the policeman quite a
fight," said Judge' Conlan to defendant.
"Eef it haf been een my countray I
haf keeled heem," was the reply.-
He will be sentenced to-day.
Sadie "Williams nnd Hattle Mason,
neither of whom is over 17 years of
age and each of whom has a decent
home and a widowed mother, were be
fore Judge Fritz on a charge of way
wardness. He confessed himself at a
loss to decide what he would do with

YOUNG MONNIER
ON THE STAND
Yoiing Man Tells of His
Life Up to and After His
Marriage to Violet Henry
WIFE EtfDS TESTIMONY
Testifies in Detail as to
\ Alleged Poisoning and of
Quarrels in the . Family
The counsel for both sides In the
Monnier will contest in Judge
Graham's court yesterday finished
the examination of Violet Monnier, the
wife of George Monnier. the contest
ant. The wife has been on the stand
for the last four days of the trial, and
during that time furnished some highly
sensational testimony. The contestant,
George Monnier, was called to the
stand during the afternoon session and
told of his boyhood and school days,
his meeting with Violet, his marriage
and subsequent separation from her
for various lengths of time. â¢
â¢The morning session began with the
resumption of the cross-examination
of Violet Monnier by George D. Col
lins, counsel for the proponents. Col
lins continued his probing into the
marital relations of the witness â¢ with
George Mcnnier, with Attorney Sulli
van for the contestant continually ob
jecting. ,
The witness then* went on to describe
two quarrels that had occurred be
tween her husband herself, during one
of which she drew a revolver to
frighten her husband ,and then at
tempted to take poison. She said that
these quarrels were caused by George's
apparent belief in the scandal she said
Mrs. Monnier Sr. had 'circulated about
her.
Violet Monnier further described In
detail the alleged attempt by Mrs.
Monnier to poison herself and her chil
dren in 1902 and harrowingly described
the agonies of the. children. - Dr. O.
Laist, who was summoned at the time,
.was placed on the stand and testified
that he treated the Monnlers for poi
soning. Under Collins* cross-exam
ination the doctor admitted that the
poisoning might have been caused by
bad food or an unclean copper cooking
utensil.
Violet Monnier again took the stand
and attempted to show that the elder
Monnier had two serious quarrels .with
his wife. The witness- also said that
Monnier had accused his wife of the
theft of some deeds, but was forced to
admit that this was at a time directly
preceding the period of his alleged
insanity. The case will be continued
this morning at 10 o'clock.

STEAMBOAT MEN
OPPOSE BRIDGE
STOCKTON, Dec. 13.â The steamboat
companies operating between Stockton
and San Francisco will to-morrow pre
sent protests to Colonel Heuer, United
States Engineer on the coast, against
the proposed;M ibridglng-i: of '.Carquinez
Straits by the Southern Pacific-Com
pany. -
The steamboat managers have been
advised that the Sacramento Transpor
tation Company and the California
Transportation Company, both operat
ing on the Sacramento River, will
protest against the bridge as planned.
The local companies protesting are the
California Navigation and Improve
ment Company, which operates twenty
tvfa vessels on the rivers, and the
Union Transportation Company, oper
ating dally steamers between Stockton
and San Francisco. Manager C. D.
Clark of the first-named company went
to San Francisco to-night to present
the company's protest in person.
The Stockton Chamber of Commerce
has taken a strong stand with the
transportation companies and all com
mercial interests will be with the pro
testants. It is asserted that a bridge
other than a suspension construction
will interfere with navigation and
cause a serious rise in the flood plane
of the San Joaquin River, endangering
millions of dollars worth of property
every year. They say that the admit
ted rise of six inches which railroad
engineers say will follow would last
year have flooded the richest section
of San Joaquin low lands.
WILL- EXACT liEXTAIi FOR
STATE XOIIMAIj SCHOOL
Board of Education Serves Notice on
Principal Burk That It Has Use
for the Building.
On and after the first day of July
the State will be compelled to pay
rental for the building now occupied
for the uses of the State Normal
School, on Powell street. A commu*
nication to that effect was sent yes
terday to Professor Burk, principal of
the Normal School, bv the Board of
Education. The building was for-
merly used by the Public Commercial
School, but when it was abandoned
some five years ago it was turned
over to the Normal School authorities
at the nomina^rental of $1 per year.
1 The reason assigned for the exac
tion of a substantial rental for the
building from the State ls that the
Board of Education ls at present pay-
Ing $120 per month for the rental of
the Chinese Primary School, around
the corner from the Normal School.
The board is desirous of discontinuing
the paying of rental for schools in
view of the paucity of Its funds and
wants to eet back the Powell-street
building.' If the State pays rent for
the latter building the same results
will be obtained and the Chines*
school continued in its present loca
tion. The action of . the board, is
timely, in view of the proposed appro
priation of $300,000 for a new State
Normal School by the next Legisla
ture. A similar appropriation was
passed at the last session, but fo>
some reason it failed to obtain the
Governor's signature. The fact that
rent will have to be paid for the build-
Ing to the city may be an incentive
to the passage of the appropriation.

THE FOREST BILL.
THE new forest bill, drawn by. the members of the Federal Bureau
of Forestry in conference with members of the Waters and For
ests Society, has some features that suggest discussion. The for- 1
estry affairs of the State are properly to be in charge of a'chief for- .
ester, who is to be nominated by the Federal Bureau of Forestry and |
appointed by the Governor. Yet this position is to be a State office, â¢
paid by the State.
We question the constitutionality of a provision which restricts j
the eligibility of a citizen to office by inviting a nominating power \
foreign to the State. It is also of questionable constitutionality be-!
cause it is a limitation upon the appointing power of the Governor. ;
If the nominating power choose not to act, the State has no power j
to compel a nomination, and the appointing power of the Governor :
is destroyed, although the office is a State office and its necessity is f
certified by its creation. Of course the purpose i3 laudable, to se- ;
cure co-operation between the State and Federal authorities. But ex- ;
pediency and laudability do not make a proposition constitutional, â¢
and this matter needs to be investigated, since the proposed law j
will require large expenditures and the State Controller would with- |
hold his warrant if there be any doubt about it.
The law proposes to confer . certain powers upon the forest I
guards. They are made semi-judicial officers, with power to make ar-#
rests and issue some forms of writ. They are also empowered to \
enter the public schools and there by teaching and other means to j
inculcate a knowledge of forestry and to promote the same through ;
the public press. Here again it may be that the law will conflict
with existing laws. For instance, the school laws and regulations I
provide a course of study for the schools, and it would not be com- ;
petent for an officer, unconnected with the educational department \
of the State, to interrupt the regular course of study.
It is provided that when the forest is on fire the forester may
issue a requisition in the nature of a subpena upon citizens to bring \
them into service as fire fighters, their compensation being 20 cent3 j
per hour. This well intended provision will be found to work badly â 
in practice. The woods are full of people who will highly esteem ;
that sort of sen-ice at that rate of compensation, and there will be .
no lack of forest fires. In a terrible forest fire not far from San j
Francisco fire fighters were paid $10 per day by property owners |
whose homes were imperiled. The next year fires arrived in the
same region on time and the same high pay was exacted. Then
the people eaw that they had put a premium upon forest arson, and
they refused to employ anybody and fought the fire with volunteers |
or let it burn out. Since then there have been fewer fires in that j
section.
It will not be wise to pay a sure salary for fire fighting. Such
a policy will burn up the State. Corporations understand the ten
dency of a policy that offers a rich reward for detection of an of
fense. The man that wants the reward will see that the offense is
committed. So corporations are now abandoning the policy of offer
ing standing rewards for anything. When a man has really de
tected an intended crime, such as derailing a train or sawing a
bridge, he*is always rewarded well but privately, lest publication of
it tempt others to create the reason for such reward and then claim
it themselves. All woodsmen know that if forest fires offer sure and
well paid employment there will always be forest fires, set by those
who want the employment and the pay. Not many years' ago the
Yosemite Commission found this very thing done in the Mariposa
Big Tree Grove, It will be unwise therefore to make such provision
in the law.
The bill should be as simple as possible, and be drawn rather
with the view of beginning a system of forest projection, to be per
fected and extended as experience is gained. A ponderous* and costly
plan, while perhaps excellent in the end, is not good in the beginning
of a new public policy. We should dislike to see the bill break down
of its too great weight, and advise that simplicity, directness and
efficiency be studied in drawing it.
IMMIGRATION AND ITS EVILS.
r T**HERE is probably no section of the nation, certainly no in-
I dustrial section, that does not feej the question of immigration
to be one demanding very special legislative consideration. The
aece&sary action would certainly not be for long delayed if there was
any adequate and general realization of the extent to which the
gates of the republic are choked day and night by the army of new
arrivals.
Every rational mind will of course agree with the President
when he says that there is no danger of having too many immi
grants of the right kind. So long as human nature remains what it
is there is no fear of any such superfluity. The country was built up
by immigration and there is always room and a welcome for energy,
for intelligence and for character. America is the last country in the
world to undervalue such qualities as these, or to turn them from
her doors. We are, however, confronted with the fact that the na
ture of the immigration has radically changed. In the early days
the European immigrant was usually the man of enterprise, of cour
age and of resource, who left his own country the poorer for his
loss, and who enriched the land of his adoption by his labor and by
his thrift. In some instances that is of cpurse still the case, but the
reverse is onlv too often the fact.
A very large proportion of those who come to America from the
countries of Europe confer, by their departure, a benefit upon their
native land. License is their only conception of liberty and they
transfer to their new homes all those unenviable characteristics
which they have neither the will nor the inclination to change. They
do not come as guests, nor as those who worthily seek for a new
home, but rather as an invading army entering the country for the
purpose of possessing it. They know little of free institutions and
they care less, preferring to herd together in their own communities
where they may preserve the most undesirable features of their for
mer life, and where they will be entirely free from the contagion of
cleanliness, sanitation or social and political progress.*
How far this state of things constitutes an increasing menace
to American integrity must be left for executive decision, which
alone can check the human flood, which is no longer composed of the
enterprising and the frugal, but rather of those who do not promise
to be more ornamental to the country of their choice than they
have been to the countries of their origin. That the President has
included in his message a matter of such vital import will be a mat
ter for widespread congratulation. Under no circumstances can we
allow the prevailing standard of life to be lowered, nor the present
level of citizenship to be degraded. Remedial measures must be
found and we need not doubt that they will be found. Undesirable
immigrants must be returned in larger numbers, the qualifications
for admission must be raised, and it may eventually be found ad
visable to enlist the aid of the American consular service in order
that the embarcation of undesirables may be hindered. Fraudulent
naturalization is the direct outcome of indiscriminate immigration
and they would disappear together. \,:\ Â«
The President points out that, according to the constitution, it
is in the power of Congress "to establish a uniform rule of natural
ization," and this being so there should be no delay in the matter.
That conditions of naturalization should vary in different States and
that even the certificates should differ in wording and appearance
is not consonant with national unity or national dignity, and we can
hardly wonder that such documents should be viewed with distrust
in foreign countries. Evidences of American citizenship should be
like Caesar's wife â above suspicion. -
Even Boston draws tlje color line somewhere. The * tenants of a high
priced apartment house in the Back Bay are in high dudgeon because a
colored woman has secured a lease of one of the flats. One of them goes so
far as to protest that her admission constitutes "one of the greatest outrages
that any Boetonian has had to stand for." What more could ; even â¢ Charles
ton eay? â Providence Journal. : T â 'â  - '

untary compliment Betty Sylvester
hurried toward the kit- -;n. leaving
Dorcas blushing and irightened â
blushing at the unusual compliment
and frightened at the prospect of her
first journey on the cars.
For a number of years Dorcas had
had a suitor. At first he had confined
his attention to stolen glances across
the fields and across the church, and
on rare occasions, when his manhood
had asserted itself, to elaborate toilet
and a half hour's leaning against the
Sylvester front fence, admiring Dor
cas' posies and talking crops. Later
he had .braved the front gate, gener
ally with a straw in his mouth, to Bit
on the steps for an hour in the gloam
ing talking with Betty, but looking at
Dorcas. On cold evenings the hour had
been passed in the cozy sitting-room,
playing checkers and popping corn.
Not a word of love had been spoken,
but it was understood in the house,
and in the whole neighborhood, that
John Baldwin waj, waiting on Dorcas
Sylvester, and that some time in the
future, as they should determine, the
two good old country families and the
two well-tilled farms would be united
â provided, of course, John Baldwin's
diffidence ever allowed him to get that
far. it
As she ran lightly down the steps to
the farm â wagon Dorcas gave 'one
quick, shy glance up the slope to where
the big Baldwin house stood half hid
den by Ita towering elms. Yes, there
was John's buggy standing in the road
before the house, and bis fast horse
could reach the.etation in one-half the

SUNDAY IN TOWN
THE sun Is misty yellow and the sky

Near and deeply, fair and faintly.
Each one following Its fellow In an echo

Many feet make haste toward pleasure.

Oh. the scarlet maples burning
Like a torch at every turn In g.

"Where from the quiet, distant
meadows.
Dim beneath the mountains' shadows.
Came the clank of swinging cow-bells
down the softest wind that blew.
Oh. I wish I were a-walklng in the au

We have had our fill of roving where
spring blossoms bound the view.
We have played in your Romances,
Danced the nymph-and-shepherd

Now the summer of our loving glows
and throbs about us. too.
In our eye the light yet vernal.

NAN PATTERSON
FACES WITNESS
NEW YORK. Dec. 13.â A dramatic
situation developed to-day in the crimi
nal branch of the Supreme Court when
"Nan" Patterson, on trial before Jus
tice Vernon M. Davis for the murdw
of Caesar Young, stood up in the
courtroom and faced Pawnbroker
Hyman Stem, the man who sold the
revolver with which Young was killed.
Stern was unable to identify the pris
oner as the woman who accompanied
the man to whom he sold the revolver.
He was not certain whether this man
had a smooth face or wore a mus
tache. He was not asked to identify
the photograph of J. Morgan Smith.
Police Captain Sweeney was re
called and identified the photograph.
He said that he saw Smith on June 8
last and gave him a Grand Jury sub
pena. Objection was made to the In
troduction as evidence of a copy of a
cubpena served by the witness, and
the Jury was excused while Justice
Davis listened to argument of counsel.
Rand Informed the court that the
theory of the prosecution was that
Emith and his wife were co-conspira
tors against Young, although they had
not planned to kill him.
The prosecutor further said he was
prepared to prove that Smith and his
wife, with the active connivance of
the defendant's father and also with
the connivance of the defendant's law
yers, had fled to parts unknown.
"When I say the . defendant's coun
sel." continued Rand, "I do not mean
you, Mr. Levy."
Justice Davis reserved decision on
the question raised.
Much of the testimony to-day was
given by experts as to the result of
their examination of skin taken from
Young'* fingers. Dr. Ernest J.
Lederle said that a microscopic ex
amination of the bits of skin , had
failed to discover traces of powder.
Dr. Charles P. Phelps said the direc
tion of the bullet that killed Young
fced been from left to right and that
the revolver was held from three to
five inches from the bodv when the
fchot was fired. â¢"-.,â¢;
STOPS DEPOSIT OP OIL
DRIPPINGS FROM MOBILES
Ordinance Recommended j Requires
Attachment of Device to Catch
Leaks From Machines.
The Supervisors' Joint Street and
Electricity committee yesterday rec
ommended a proposed ordinance pro
hibiting the deposit of oil drippings
on the public streets from automo
bile*, whether in motion or not. Tes
timony was adduced that the oil ac
cumulates in pools on certain streets,
especially on the block on Golden
Gate avenue, between Scott and De
v'sadero. streets, making It impossible
for horses to keep their footing. The
committee thougtu some device should
be placed on automobiles to catch the
drippings, it being suggested that a
pan or leather boot be used. The at
torney for automobile dealers object
ed to compelling the use of any par
ticular device, as it would not entire
ly stop the dripping when the automo
bile is in motion. The committee
thought the device would do away
v<ith most of the nuisance complained
of and added a new section to the or
dinance requiring a suitable device to
be attached to automobiles for the
purpose of preventing leaks.

WOULD UPROOT
NEW BILLETS
Merchants' Association At
torneys Make Attack on
Health Board's Appointees
TRY TO VACATE PLACES
Counselor Ruef Strongly
Contends That There Are
No Grounds for the Action
Argument was begun before Judge
Sloss yesterday morning on the suit of
J. E. Qulnn, backed by the Merchants'
Association, for an injunction pre
venting: Auditor Baehr from paying
the salaries of Deputy Health Officer
Louis Levy and Inspecting Physicians
Goodale, Hannah, Walsh and Glover.
The argument was opened by Abe
Ruef. representing the employes of
the Health Department. He wu fol
lowed by H. Wright and Franklin K.
Lane, representing the opposition. At
the hour of adjournment Lane had
not concluded his argument. It will
be resumed to-morrow morning.
Ruef contended that the men ap
pointed by the new Board of Health
last January were not employes, but
under the State constitution were of
ficers, and as such could not be placed
under the classified civil service list.
Wright and Lane, on the other hand,
attempted to show that these men
were appointed to take the place of
employes, did the duties of employes
and should accordingly have been se
lected from the civil service eligible
list. They further sought to show
that the appointments had not been
made in good faith, quoting from the
testimony given in court and before
the Supervisors to show that the
members of the board knew neither
the men they were discharging nor
those they were employing.
Ruef contended that the inspecting
physicians, by reason of their being
appointed as physicians, their medical
knowledge and the peculiar work re
quired of them by the Board of
Health, were exempt from civil ser
vice, as the charter expressly provides
for such exemption. He also showed
that the Civil Service .Commission
took this view, as it approved the ap
pointment of Drs. Glover, Goodale,
Hannah and Walsh.
LEVY'S STREXUOUS WORK.
He presented figures to show that
previously there had been six sanitary
inspectors, and this number was cut
down to four for the sake of effi
ciency and economy; also that the
appointment of Deputy Health Officer
Louis Levy effected a saving of ' su
pernu. 3rary salaries of $6300, and
that the city had been by the change
saved Jld.OOO a year, the deputy
health officer having taken the place
of five men, and, further, when the
Supervisors made out the last budget
it had by reason of this saving with
held that sum from the Health De
partment.
Mr. Ruef argued that there was no
charge made that the Civil Service
Commission was corrupt or had con
spired, and since it was not made the
court must be bound by its action, as
it was a quasi-judicial body estab
lished by the charter.
Attorney Wright quoted the char
ter to show that the Civil Service
Commissioners and they alone have
the right to classify places. If this is
not the case, he said, you might just
as well cut out the portion of the
charter relating to civil service, as any
department may establish unusual
qualifications for an office in order
that a favorite will get the appoint
ment. On this line he used as an in
stance the position of Deputy Health
Officer, which was created almost a
year ago. but for which no examina
tion has ever been held.
RUEFÂ»S PLEA ASSAILED.
So far as Levy was concerned
Wright stated flatly that he was not
performing the multiferious duties
which it was said he would perform
when the appointment was made, that
he was nothing more nor less than the
secretary of the board, and as such
should have been appointed from the
civil service eligible list. â¢
Franklin K. Lane opened his argu
ment by contesting the right of any
board to specify the qualifications of
those to be employed by it. "This
Board of Health," he said, "created
new places before it knew what the
duties of the men they were employing
would be. One of its members had
been appointed but a few hours be
fore he Introduced' the resolution dis
charging certain men and appointing
others, giving new names to the posi
tions. Let the board hold a competi-

"Acting as the Health Board did,
the Board of Public Works mij^ht re
quire aJl street inspectors to be sten
ographers and all side-sewer inspect
ors to be civil engineers. This scheme
would break down civil service en
tirely, and if perpetuated there would
not be a civil service man remaining
in the municipal employ."
In reviewing the work "of the in
specting physicians, Lane said they
did little but tack up signs in reÂ»

LONG DISTANCE
DIVORCE SUIT
Husband Is in Panama and
Wife in Australia While
Their Attorneys Try Case
DEPOSITIONS ARE READ
Doctor and Chorus'Girl Do
Not Tell the Same Story.
Troubles of a Contractor
A seafaring medico on board a
steamer at Panama, and a chorus girl
helping to amuse the public In Aus
tralia are the widely separated par
ties to a divorce suit, the trial of
which was begun yesterday before
Judge Kerrigan. Their absence may
detract from visual ' interest in the
case, but their lawyers are affording
ample entertainment for the ear In
the way of spicy depositions.
The plaintiff is Dr. W. B. Bates, a
ship physician who formerly practiced
medicine and dentistry in this city.
His wife was. Myrtle. Scott, who trod
the boards at Fischer's and went with
the Kolb-Dill troupe to the antipodes.
He charged her with cruelty. She
entered denials, set up a recriminatory
defense, and filed a cross-complaint
accusing him of mistreatment. Her
croBs-complaint was withdrawn by
Attorney Martin Stevens at the open
ing of the trial yesterday, but he will
fight the case to the end.
Attorney Roy Hudson read Estes'
deposition in which . the allegations of
hie complaint were elaborated into de
tails. They were married November
1, 1902. Some months afterward they
separated, but on occasions made up
and lived together for brief â¢ periods.
In October, 1903, when she was living
at the Winchester, she telephoned him
en invitation to accompany her on a
yachting trip. The yacht was to leave
early in the morning. Shortly after
that midnight she summoned two men,
had him bound and handcuffed and
t&ken in an ambulance to Mrs. Atkin
son's sanitarium on Sutter street.
There he was placed behind bars. The
night following she had him removed,
as a dangerous case, to the California
Hospital, where he was soon given his
liberty. He says she took this method
of blocking the divorce case which he
had filed. On another occasion she
locked him in a room at Keswick, in
Shasta County, because, he says, he
would not give her a patent medicine
which he had compounded.
INJURED HIS PRACTICE.
He declared that she spent the
whole of her time in his office and
injured his practice by making derog
atory remarks about him to his pa
tients. He charged her with wrong
fully accusing him of immorality and
said that she would visit the officers
of the battleship New York, dine with
them and accept presents from them.
Of three men paying her attentions he
said one was a naval officer, one a
newspaper man, and the third a hard
ware dealer. He denied her specific
charges of cruelty and said he did not
live with her after the divorce suit
was filed.
Estes' mother, Mrs. Rebecca Estes,
disclosed the fact that he is in Pan
ama and, under cross examination, a
letter from her to him was read advis
ing him to stay away and get a
divorce from "that woman."
F. C. Hawes, might clerk at the
Winchester, testified as to the circum
stances of Estes being handcuffed and
removed In an ambulance.
Attorney Stevens began the reading
of the wife's deposition and may con
clude it to-day. She says that Estes
had the morphine habit and was under
the influence of the drug when she had
him sent to the sanitarium for his own
good. She was afraid he would take
an overdose. She told of an incident in
his office regarding a woman named
Mrs. Tighe, with whom the doctor was
said to be very friendly. There was a
scene and Mrs. Tighe is reported to
have said: "I have a good notion to
smash your face into jelly; you are
only a" low chorus girl," 'Estes was
abusive, she said, and once threatened
to cut her. throat. After he began his
suit he would visit iier rooms, take her
to dinners and the theater and try to
induce her to withdraw her defense.
He is said to have dragged her by the
arm to his attorney to- get her to sign
papers for dismissal of her opposition,
but she declined to sign. Mrs. Estes
denies the accusations regarding the
naval officers and others and she gives
many interesting details of her excit
ing encounters with her husband.
THEY SUE TOGETHER.
Louis N. Vazlna and his wife Lau
rita-decided yesterday to go to court
for relief. His complaint for divorce,
charging cruelty, was filed first by
UNION LEAGUE

AMENDMENT TO BY-LAWS
Nominating Committee to
Select Officers for the
Ensuing Year Is Chosen
A general meeting of tho Union
League Club last evening was largely
attended. A nominating committee as
follows was chosen to nominate officer*
for the ensuing year: W. C. Van Fleet.
Carroll Cook, A. H. Vail, V. W. Gas
kill, William Macdonald, A. W. Spear.
W. H. Gordan, Thomas Kirkpatrick,
Dr. C. T. Deane and J. W. Carmany.
The committee will meet during the
coming week. It is trie impression in
the league that Colonel George H. Pip
py, under whose administration the
club moved into the superb clubhouse
on Post street facing Union Square,
will be nominated for another term, and
it is also gossip that the committee will
recommend only a few changes in tho
directory. The members are highly
pleased with the ne'w quarters. There
are so many applicants for admission
to the club that an amendment to the
by-laws increasing the membership
from 1000 to 1500 was proposed last
night and will be acted on at the an
nual meeting on the second Tuesday of
January, 1905.
A proposition to increase the admis
sion fee for city members to $50 and
for visiting members to $25 will also be
considered at the annual meeting.
It is predicted that the measure to
Increase the membership to 1500 will
be adopted without dissent, as tho
limit of 1000 is. already attained, with
many applications for admission pend
ing.
Early in January on the occasion of
the opening of the Ladles' Annex a
reception in compliment to the ladies
will be given. The annex, consisting of
a reception apartment and grillroom, is
being fitted up in excellent style. The
decorations' and general equipment
wiU involve an outlay of $5000.
Pleads Guilty to Burglary.
John Blgley, alias Henry Stahmann,
alias Frank Wilson, an ex-convict,
pleaded guilty to a. charge of burglary
in Judge Dunne's court yesterday. He
will be sentenced on Saturday. He
broke Into the residence of Mrs. Mary
G. O'Kane, 2001 Broadway, on Aug
ust 31 and stole a quantity of silver

tenance, followed an hour later, charg
ing desertion. She says' he has $5000
worth of realty, $600 in bank 'and an in
come of $300 a' month; of which she
wants $60 for alimony. His complaint
i3 a rare recital of feminine persecu
tion and he exhausts an inventory of
household goods in naming the articles
she threw at him. Culled from the list
are furniture, stove lifters, 1 shoes,
hair brushes, rolling-pins, Â» stewpans,
stewed fruit and knives. She is said to
iiave threatened his life with gas and
a knife. She threw his best clothes in
to the basement, burned hia contracts
and destroyed his architects' specifica
tions, according to the complaint, and
all of her acts he traces to the use of
liquor.
Mrs. Vazina's attorney, A. B. Tread
well, went to Judge Sloss for an order
restraining Vazina from disposing of
his property, but the double complaints
caused the court to defer action.
Treadwell, however, obtained . from
Judge Kerrigan a writ of habeas
corpus for the ., possession of an 8
months-old babe of the couple which
Vazlna "kidnaped" from the mother's
home, 47 De Long avenue, last Sunday
night. A year ago last summer Vazina
sued for divorce on the same grounds
alleged in this case, but they made up
and lived together, again.
Divorces were granted yesterday by
Judge Kerrigan to Frederick H. Kidd
from Hannah Kldd, j desertion; Annie
M. Lawson from Marshal Lawson,
neglect; by Judge Graham to John E.
Paul from Susie Paul, infidelity; by
Judge Murasky to John Connell from
Jennie Connell, cruelty.
On the grounds of neglect and deser
tion .Sophronla B. Strickland sues for
divorce from Doyal B. Strickland, a
hackman, who has $2000 worth of prop
erty and an Income of $150 a month.

BARNEY OLDFIELD SHATTERS AUTOMOBILE RECORDS ON THE FRESNO RACECOURSE
ANDREW B. COOK IS AGAIN DEFEATED
Romaine, Piloted by
Helgesen, Wins
Handicap.
STROLLERUNPLACED
Dr. Sherman Finishes
Second to Fast
Alice Carev.
BY FIIED E. MULIIOLLAND.
Honiton declined the issue in that
â¢ix and a half furlong handicap at
Oakland yesterday, and Romaine, a
plebeian sprinter, captured the special
feature of the menu. .tomalne
polished off everything in the plater
division and was sent after harder
ganie. Sea Voyage, Ilo\\Â«?na and Ish
lar.a. other absentees, pruned the actual
number of starters down to half a
dozen.
Stroller, assigned 103 pounds, closed
a Blight favorite over Is'lgrette, Jhe
Jennings entry. The track was too
heavy fyr Stroller and Davis could
nut prevent Xigrrette from bearing in
toward the rail, and becoming an
chored in the deep footing.
Andrew li. Oook, â  ridden by Ander
â on, performed his customary sky
rocket turn out in the lead, and as
there was nothing to carry him along,
came close to getting the coin. Had
Helgeiren not exercised the best of
Judgment on Romaine. Cook wouid
havt- won. As it was, the bush horse
only lost the decision by a neck in a
hard drivo. Judge ran third, on the
rail. The winner went to the post at
odds of 7'i to 1.
Favorites held their' own by annex
ing three purses. The fields were well
balanced, and. considering the heavy
conditiou of the track, the horses ran
remarkably well to form. The attend
ance and betting were up to the stand
ard.
Marie J., which was installed fa
vorite for the five and a half fur
long scramble for 2-year-olds, the cur
tain raiser, could not untrack herself.
The winner turned up in Fay Temple
ton, a T to 1 chance, ridden by Ander
son, which, in a hard drive, led Baker
out a neck. Melar ran ;hird.
Willie Daly, astride his father's geld
ing Canonicus, took the mile event for
maidens. The big son of Indio re
ceived stanch support at 13 to 10,
and passing Darksome in the run
home, downed Serenity a couple of
lengths. The show fell to Darksome.
Sammy Greenfield piloted Bob
Itagon, winner of the next race, a
five and a half furlong spin for two
jet.r-o!ds. Opening a 9 to 5 chance,
the colt's price lengthened to 2*4 to
1. He disposed of Gallant Cassie by
four or>en lengths. Jerusha, the pace
maker, was third.
Alice Carey, cocked and primed for
a killing, landed the six-furlong run,
fifth to be decided. Backed from 9 to
6 and piloted by Alarie, the mare
early outfooted Revolt and at the
close led the favorite. Dr. Sherman,
out three lengths. Revolt dbwned
Sugden for third place honors.
Travers assuredly selected a tortu
ous route for Briers, the 6 to 5 favor
ite In the betting on the final event.
-*fter being pocketed on half a dozen
occasions, Travers made a sweeping
turn into the stretch and just did suc
ceed in defeating Inspector ilunro a
rose-. MoFketo at 40 to 1 ran third.
There was a cord attachment on the
bit of Xigrette to prevent her from
bearing in toward the rail, but it
availed nothing. The black mare is
used to running there, and. despite
Davis' efforts, gained her point.
Stroller, it was always figured, was
at his best on a sloppy trae!:. . â¢>?
Sam Greenfield rides a good enough
race to suit almost everybody. When
It comes to a drive Sam is usually
there on time.
After investigating the race won by
Komombo on Monday the stewards
find nothing to indicate that any care
fully planned coup was pulled off. The
filly was not played in the out-of-town
poolrooms, and her owners. Parkei
and Thwaites. are held blameless of
any attempt at fraud.

BBITT ADOPTS
ROUGH TACTICS
That Jimmy Britt does not think it
will be a parlor entertainment he is to
attend next Tuesday night in Me
chanics' Pavilion with Battling Nelson
is evident from the work he is doing in
training.
There is a terrible earnestness in his
boxirÂ«r with Frank Rafael and in his
rough work with Tiv. Kreling to show
what he expects when he meets the
Dane. There Is not a moment devoted
to fancy boxing. It is all slug, slug and
wrestle with a chance always of one of
those fierce blows reaching a vital spot.
Britt went three rounds with Rafael
yesterday before the usual large gal
lery, including a number of ladies, who
watched the mir-tc warfare with bated
breath and bulging eyes. Spider Kelly
kept time and coached Britt when he
saw an opening. Britt led with his
right repeatedly, something he has not
done in recent fights. From his tactics
in training it is evident he expects to
wear Nelson down with his body blows
which have been so effective with other
opponents. If Nelson can assimilate
these he is, in truth, an iron man. Britt
y ill waste no blows on the hard rhead
of the Dane. He is hitting with won
derful precision, timing his blows to a
nicety and seldom missing the mark at
which he aims. .'.-..
Britt boxed three rounds with Roach,
a clever little 100-pounder from the
Olympic Club. Britt contented himself
with countering and his weight proved
too much for his aggressive little spar
ring, mate. . j "â¢".-? u;
After the. boxing came the wrestling.
The casual spectator gains the impres
sion that â¢ Kreling is trying to pull
Britt's head off his shoulders from the
manner in which they go tearing
around the gymnasium. After pulling
and hauling for some time they fall to
slugging, taking the precaution to hit a
spot protected by a glove, thus follow
ing the tactics pursued "by boxing in
structors.
Kreling is the passive, instrument" In'
the hands of Britt, allowing the latter
to do all the work. All these : signs
point to some lively milling when. Britt
gets into action. He will* be 'more
speedy .than Nelson or any one the Iat-
tÂ«r has met and how the Dane will off
set this advantage remains, to^ be seen.
Britt is taking so kindly to his work
that he will keep It up throughout the
week. While he is within easy distance
of the required weight he perspires
freely, showing he is not drawn dawn
too fine.
Yesterday morning about the time
the residents of Larkspur were yawn-
Ing and thinking it about time to rise
Battling Nelson, attired in an oilskin
and covered with mud, . returned : to his
camp at Smiling Metzner's tavern after
having hit the high places of Marin
County for; twelve miles.
As he neared camp he was singing
"Out in the hail and the rain and the
enow.".- As his mud-covered clothes
were being removed the Dane' explain-
THE SAN- FRANCISCO r CALL, ..WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 14, 1904.
WITCH HAZEL IS A WINNER
Starting at Odds of Thirty* to One Leads
Out the Favorite, Fireball.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 13.â Three
favorites, two second choices and an
outsider were the winners to-day at
Ascot. The outsider furnished the
sensation of the day. It was in ithe
second race, in which Fireball, holder
of the track record for four and a
half furlongs, was made a 6 to 5 fa
vorite. Tyrolean, Tramotor, Cutter
and Hilona were also well played.
Witch Hazel was coupled with Revel
in the betting at 25 and 30 to 1. The
race looked to be Fireball's until the
last fifty yards, when Witch Hazel
came like a rocket on the outside and
won by a nose from Fireball, with
Hilona third.
The flrst hurdle race of the season
was won by the favorite, Milas, with
Mrs. Grannan a close second and Dr.
Long third.
The best race on the card was the
fourth at one mile and went to Prin
cess Tulane after a gallant struggle
with Hans Wagner. Emperor of In
dia was third. Flo Bob, the favorite,
ran last. Escalante beat High Chan
cellor, the favorite, in the fifth in the
fast time of 1:09^ for the Slauson
course. Kenilworth was third. Cloche
d'Or, Dutiful and Iras were mixed up
ed : "This j . running in s, the mud Is
dandy. It reminds me of the days
when I fought around Chicago." After
a brisk rub-down Bat took his gun and
went into the foothills in quest : of
quail. - . . ,
An hour's hard work was accomplish
ed in the gymnasium during the after
noon, when the Dane went through his
usual stunts. After going four short
but fast rounds with Eddie Santry,
Bat hooked up with Stockings Kelly.
It was curtains for Stockings in. two
rounds, as he received a love tap on
the point of the. jaw. Kelly says he
distinctly saw his. future home. A
young amateur from this city lasted
about a round and a half.
Nelson tipped the beam at 132%
pounds. N '.'? r^fe v .

Judges Award Against Joe Carroll 'in
a Boxing Contest.
Jack O'Brien, the south side
featherweight: boxer, was given an un
merited decision over Joe Carroll, the
champion amateur featherweight," at
the Hayes Valley Club's exhibition last
night at Woodward's Pavilion. \ â  The
spectators showed their/ disapproval
of the decision by roundly hooting the
verdict of the judges. Referee. Roche
was surprised at the decision, but it
was not within his . power to change
it. Carroll outfought and outboxed

AUTO RECORDS BROKEN
'â FRESNO,' Dec. 13. â Barney Old
fleld in ji his automobile, the Green
Dragon, . smashed every record from
fifteen "miles to fifty this afternoon on
the Fresno Fair Grounds racetrack.
In 4 8 minutes 39 1-5 seconds he tore
round the mile oval over fiftv times,
reducing the world's record of 55:42
for fifty - miles, \ held by Charles
Gorndt, by 7 minutes and 2 4-5 sec
onds. The record for every mile un
der the fifteen to fifty was; slashed.
The terrific pace heated the engine of
the dare-devil's machine and he had
to quit at the end of the fifty miles,
or else he would have torn minutes
from every record between fifty and
sixty miles as well.
Three thousand people stood with
their hearts in their throats while
Barney Oldfleld flew "around the track.
There was no wind, but the air was
heavy.
- Charles Burman in his light-weight
touring car. Blue Streak, made two
runs of four miles each. The second
was not phenomenal, but the first was
run in 4:13 7-10. the last mile being
clipped oft in 1:02 1-5. which tied the
world's record for a mile, held by
Burman himself in this type of ma
chine.
All Interest centered in the great
Oldfield. Until the fifteenth mile was
finished no record was broken. That
distance was covered in 14:02. which
lowered Barney's own record of
14:05. Then up to twenty went the
records. The twenty-five mile record
made bv Charles Kaiser at Cleveland.
Ohio, was finished in 23:39 3-5, which
was exactly 20 seconds better than
Kaiser's time. Gorndt's thirty mile
record of 28:47 was taken down to
28:38 4-5. Barney's fastest mile was
the sixth. The time for that mile was
56 1-5 seconds.
Barney declares the Fresno track
is one of the fastest, if not the fastest,
in the United States. He said he
would return here for another try as
soon as possible. He believes he can
break every record he goes after on
it. The turns are perfect and the
earth packed for speed. To-day he>
said it was too damp for the short
distance records.

Wrestlers In Hnrd Training.
Tom Jenkins, the American, and
Buzayell, the Algerian, who are to par
ticipate in the revival of wrestling at
Woodward's Pavilion on Friday night,
are two entirely different types of mar
velous muscular manhood. The skin
of one is white and the other black,
and as marked does the difference ap
pear in figure. Jenkins is tremendous,
ponderous, massive. Buzayell is lithe,
sinewy, powerful. Of the two types
Jenkins has the ideal wrestler's form,
the bull-like neck measuring nineteen
Inches and denoting enormous power,
but the Algerian has a trunk that
shows force in every breath and he
moves with the agility of a panther.
Buzayell is an Algerian, not a negro
as many have imagined. His English
tongue has riot been cultivated enoueh
to make conversation easy, but his
French is fluent, and he speaks pure
Arabic, according to a linquist who vis
ited him at the Hayes Valley Club yes
terday morning. There is a merry
twinkle in the black's eye most of the
time, but a scowl may be discerned
when things do not go right while on
the mat. He handled three bulky sons
of France yesterday. One of the chaos
was a 200 pounder and no novice. The
scowls were for him. Buzayell would
be a bad man to arouse If his features
tell the tale aright.

BOB RAGON won. on the bitsky. My message said:
"NEXT BEST BET, BOB RAGON. BOB RAGON Is an Immortal
cinch, bar bad ride only. Is much the best on class and fitness and should
have no- difficulty whatever In winning. PLUNGE TO WIN!"
INSPECTOR MUNRO, 7 to I, 2d
The INSPECTOR got beaten * snute. My message said:
"NEXT BEST BET OF THE DAY. INSPECTOR MUNRO. INSPEC-
TOR MUNRO was not shown up until his last race, which he won gallop-
Ing. He Is at least 10 pounds better than rated; likes the mud. Should
come home on the bit. Figures Just as good as WHOA BILL would herÂ©.
Go as far as you like.
SERENITY, 5 ti I, 2d
. My wire said of SERENITY: ~
"NEXT BEST BET. SERENITY. SERENITY Is my advertised
'Sleeper* No. 2. Has only a bunch of pigs to beat. The boy went to sleep
on him In his last two races. Has speed to burn. Is fit as a fiddle. Bet
the works on SERENITY to win!"
Plenty of 5 to 2 was laid against INSPECTOR MUNRO for the place
and all the 2 to 1 you wanted against SERENITY for the place. A $20
play straight and place on my four "babies" yesterday netted $283 clear
profit.

If Not Sold at Hongkong
Steamship Will Return,
to Home Port in England
C03IPLETES TWENTY
'. YEARS OF SERVICE
Starts on Ninety - Fourth
Voyage With the Largest
Cargo She Ever Carried
The Occidental and Orientnl Steam
ehip Company's liner Gaelic, looking
as hsjnSsome as on the day she started
on her first voyage across the Pacific
twenty years ago, sailed yesterday for
the Orient on her ninety-fourth and
last voyage. She has made her last
appearance in this port as an O. and O.
liner. "Whether or not she ever enters
the Golden Gate ajrain depends upon
vrtial happens to her at Hongkong.
The famous old liner is for sale, and
if she changes owners in the Orient the
fortunes of trade may brim? her back.
If ehe returns to England, she will more
than likely be placed in honorable re
tirement and maintained as an ex
ample of careful living and faithful
service for the benefit of the giddy
leviathans now carrying the world's
commerce.
Sailing on the l*th of the month and
carrying thirteen cabin passengers
might disturb some eailormen, but no
body on the Gaelic seemed to be op
pressed yesterday by any superstitious
dread.
""VVot's thirteen?" asked a grizzled
Quartermaster; "writ's Friday for that
matter, or rats leavin', w'en you 'ave a
boat as is lucky as the Gaelic Wy,
â we've carried more missionaries than
any other packet on the bloomin'
hocean, an* we hain't never missed a
Bailln* day. Thirteen ain't the best
o' numbers, and Friday ain't Jack's
favorite day, but *oly Joes is the worst
luck afloat and we's carried 'em by the
dozens. Aye, aye, sir. All clear."
In addition to her thirteen cabin pas
sengers the Gaelic carried about 150
Asiatics and nearly 4000 tons of cargo.
She carried a large shipment of treas
ure for Japan. Her cabin passengers

Park" racetrack's stake book, with full
announcement of stake conditions,
purses and so. on, including those of
the American Derby, will be issued

This positive announcement, was
made to-day by one close'. .< to
the men ruling the- southslde
club and one interested in many con
ferences which have followed the clos
ing down of the track last June. The
statement gives the impression that a
strong effort would be made to run
off the 1905 Derby./ It Is known that
at the Western Jockey , Club's recent
meeting, when racing dates were as
signed to clubs controlled by that or
ganization, Washington Park, as usual
in past years, drew the so-called
"plum" 'date*.
These range ; from June 24 to July
25 â twenty- five racing days in all. It
has been customary. In the past to run
the Derby on the opening day of the
meeting, which is always on Saturday.
Secretary Howard, -it* is announced,
will personally visit the coast and
New Orleans soliciting: entries for the
stakes. â¢

"HE 8AVKD MY LIFE" LAST WEEK.â
Through eating tainted meat I suffered the
most awful, exerutiating torments from
PTOMAINE POISONING. Every moment
eeeir.ed as if it would be my LAST. 1
writhed In exquisite anguish all the time.
There was constant violent vomiting and
purging with inconceivable, intolerable tor-
ture all over my body especially in stom-
ach and bowels. I felt 1 must surely Vliu
unless speedily helped, but nothing relieved
me in the least. 1 was collapsing from the
most cruel agonies and exhaustion. Then
came Rexradio. whose "first" treatment (in-
stantly) gave me extraordinary relief. It waa
like passing trom hell to heaven. The second
treatment fully and permanently stopped all
the dreadful pains, vomiting and purging,
with no return* since. That night I slept
soundly and ever since have felt like a new
man, entirely painless, easy and hearÂ»y, an-1
able as ui?ual to attend to my business. 1
cannot speak too highly, of Rexradio and hU
truly "marvelous" humanized radium treat-
ment, which I earnestly recommend to all
sufferers. Before I was a "skeptic." but now
Rexradio has not a more enthusiastic, grate-
ful advocate than I am. He healed me as
if by magic, and undoubtedly saved my
life. Call on me any time. â Richard J.
Keneflck. 7 Fourth st. f

These gentlemen are here to perfect
themselves in the sport of polo as

ca. They will spend the season herÂ©
and on their return to Germany will
put the game into more general prac
tice in the Kaiser's domain. Among
the players to-day were George Mes
seroy of New York, a friend of Georg*
J. Gould, who wore the scarlet colors
and acquitted himself superbly. F. J.
Mackey waa also in the match and
played in hia usual fine form, scoring
three goals for his side. Cyril Tobln
also played a matchless gam?, and
added additional laurels to his grow
ing fame. The sides were as follows:
"Whitesâ W. S. Hobart. F. J. Mackey,
Charles "W. Clark, J. O. Tobin Jr.
Redsâ Cyril R. Tobin, George MeÂ»

with t!r.Â« general llet showing advances. In

The Weatlicr and Crops.
The weekly rei>ort cf A. G. McAdle, section
director of the climate and crop service of
th# Weather Bureau, is as follows:
GENITRAL SUMMARY.
la the central and northern sections the
weather vu cool and frosty at the beginning
c! the week and warmer toward the cloie.
â¢with rain on the Â»th and 10th in most places.
i>ivj- foes were frrquent in the coaet dis
tricts. In the southern section the weather
rts generally warm ar.d clear, with dry winds.
Early eown craln has not been injured by
the heavy frosts and lc In excellent condition,
though its growth has been somewhat re
tarded by cool weather. Plowing and seeding
are progressing rapidly in the central and
northern sections, and the acreage in grain
â w"l be large. Very little farm work has
bÂ»en done In the routh. owing to thÂ« scarcity
of rainfall, and thÂ» outlook for a grain crop
la not good. PÂ£5ti:rage is plentiful and of
excellent quality in all places except the
* juth. Stock continues in good condition.
The correspondett at Cloverdale reports that
oranges in that vicinity have not been in
jure by the heavy frosts and are in excel
test condition; the email Japonete oranges
fere rip* and other varieties are coloring rapid
ly. Orange picking is progressing in the oihei
olstricts and heavy shipments are beins made
for the holiday trad*. In the Orovine and
.Porter-rill* districts tfce crop is about aver
age and most of it has b*en harvested. In
Southern California the yield is considerably
1*Â£S than last ntton'f and the fruit is color
ing slowly. All reports agree as to the ex
cellent quality of the oranges. Olive pick
ing i s *till in progress in some sections, and
st Cloverdale the crop is unusually large.
. VruniriK Is rrosressinE in orchards and vlne
jards.
SACRAMENTO VALLEY. â Cool weathei
.with heavy frosts prevailed during the first
cf the week, and wa* followed by higher
-temperature and rein at the close. The frosts
reused tome damage to olives on the trees
and tender rarden truck, but did not injure
oranrrr nor grain. Conditions were somewhat
unfavorable for the growth of train and grass,
but both are looking welL Plowing and seed
ing continue. Green feed is plentiful and
Ftock is doing well. Orange picking and ship
ping are in progress and the crop is reported
nry rood. Olives are yielding an excellent .
crop " in eome places. Orchard pruning hat
commenced.
COAST AND BAY SECTIONS.â The weather
was cool and frosty at the beginning of the
week, but warmer toward the close. Rain fell
In the central and northern sections Friday
and Saturday; in Fanta Clara and Sonoma
<*oonties the rreciDitation was about one inch.
Heavy foes were frequent In the coast dis
tricts. Grain and feed continue in good con
dition except in portions of the southern dis
tricts. Plowing and feeding are progressing.
The correspondent at Cloverdale reports:
'Treats have not been heavy enough to dam
sse orange?. Japanese oranges are ripe. Some
seedlings are colored, but are not sweet. Other
varieties are coloring rapidly. Olives are ;
â¢ ready to pick." Pruning in vineyards and
orchards contir.ues.
SAN JOAOUIN VALLEY. â Generally cloudy
and cool weather prevailed during the week,
with light showers ia the northern portion of
the valley on Thursday and Friday. Plowing
and reeding continue in the northern portion
of the valley and good progress has been
rr.a<!le, but the ground Is too dry for cultiva
tion in the central and southern portions.
Ksrty town train Is making good progress,
but rain Is badly needed in all sections. The
greater portion of the orange crop has been
marketed; the fruit is of good fize and ex
cellent quality. Large shipments of potatoes
â¢ ami hay to Southern California point* continue
from Stockton. Pruning vines has commenced
in some localities. Frosts have been frequent?
but no daicace has resulted. Green feed 1h
plentiful and stock Is in good condition and
healthy.
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.â Warm, clear
weather prevailed most of the week, with
dry!=g wlnrts in some sections. Oranges were
â¢benefited by the warm weather and are now
coloring mere rapidly in most place*. Pick
'.nr for the holiday trade Is progressing and
â even! carloads were shipped during the week.
The oranges are generally excellent in quality,
but th* yield in mort sections will be below
average. Grape fruit Is smaller than usual,
â¢â¢â¢mirjr to the scarcity of water. Lemons are
in fair condition, but show lack of moisture.
Farm work is at a Ftandstlll and creen feed
has failed In nearly all sections.
Los Angles Summary. â Oranges are ren
crcMy ripening nicely and of good rize and
Quality; crop less than last season. In the
southern sections the fruit is not ripe enough
for the holiday trade. Lemcas in some sec-'
tier* are the finest ever handled: Kenerally
an averace yield. A carload going out dally
/T<->m r)ace5. J
Eureka Summary. â Clear, with some frort
the fore part of the week. The present rain
caused cassation of farm work. Grass and
prain growing rapidly. Stock doing excep
tionally â well. Apple shipments continue.

it waa perceived that' it would' not yield bcljw
that the market advanced. This stock again
demonstrated its effective dominating power on
the market in the last hour. At that time a
levei of prices had been attained for the prin
cipal market loaders from 1 to 2 points above
last night. Amalgamated Copper itself had
riÂ«*n 5% over the nnal price -of yesterday. It
was its abrupt relapse over 2 points which
gave the market Its sudden chill again. When
the sudden reversal in the movement of Amal
gamated Copper v.-as ae^n to be a false start
there were recoveries almost as sudden as the
reaction. But this was not entirely convincing,
to sentiment and the closing evinced much hes
itation and uncertainty. The break at the
opening cost the price level generally from 1
to 3 points. There â¢ were much larger declines
in some stocks, but they Â»w not representa

restored by the subsequent rally. Lack&wanna

American Express 5. These were generally
recognized as due to the rellnqulshment of
measures used to force a few stocks of this
class to an unwarrantable high level for effect
on the speculation in the general market. The
morning break had the result of making some
prices lower ..than thoee en the low point on
Thursday last, but it could not "be said thai
the averaxe levei of the market was below
that point. It was evidently the intention of
the Fupportera-of the market that it should not
be. as that would hava the effect of exhaust
ing margins and uncovering stop-Ions orders
which were not disturbed by last week's raid,
and thus bring an additional avalanche of
liquidation upon the markot. General news
features revived little attention, although the
continued rise in . sterling exchange caused
some djscuseion of the probability of further
gold export". Money was very easy and was
not a factor in the market.
Bonds declined early, but showed some re
covery. Total sales (par valpe). $7,240,000.

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, Dec. 13. â Wheat traders were in
clined to hold off for Secretary Shaw'a final
decision with regard to the proposed draw
backs on' Canadian wheat mill-eJ in bond. The
decision the traders expected would be an
nounced to-morrow. Uncertainty as to the
effect Impelled cautious longs to unload and
resulted in a loss of %c to >/4c at the opening,
the inilial price of May being $1 CO^gÂ»l 0&%.
Large Northwestern arrivals were also a fac
tor in producing weakness. A report that the
yield in Argentina was blighted to a consider
able extent and the cold weather was retarding
growth caused enough buying to advance the
price of May to $1 10Vi. 'J*he betterment from
this source, however, soon passed and on' the
reaction May sold off to $1 0S%. One of 'the
most important causes of the downward .ten
dency â¢' of prices waa lack of support. The
close was easy. %<S'%c lower, at $1 08% for
May delivery, 94c above the low point of the
day.
Corn was firm at the opening, but later be
came even weaker than wheat. December
broke sharply, closing l%c lower at 45%c.
May closed Uc lower at 44%c.
Oats were firm. May closed unchanged at
30% c.

The desirability of having a Pacific
Coast man app<iinted by President
Roosevelt as a member of the Inter
state Commerce Commission led to' the
adoption of a. resolution yesterday by
the California State Board of Trade, in
which the commercial organizations of
Ban Francisco were requested to ap
point a committee In conjunction with
the State Board of Trade, to take
proper action.
W. H. Mills suggested that the com
mittee ought not to Indorse any partic
ular person for the commisslonership
and this idea was adopted by the board.
Mr. Mills Bald that he had been in
formed that President Roosevelt fa
vors representation for this coast in the
commission.

ELUDE GUARDS
AND GET AWAY
Ten military prisoners made their
escape from the stockade at the Rodeo
rifle range on Monday night. It was
a daring act, well planned, and suc
cessfully carried out.
The prisoners who made the bold
dash for liberty are: Donald Thome,
Clyde Smith, Thomas Mills, Richard
Wells, Claude Paumapeer, George L.
Perry. O. F. Smith; Charles Stuart,
Sam Stevens and William Clark.
At the time of the escape the prison
ers were guarded by men of the Thir
teenth and Tenth Infantry. The night
was very dark and a dense fog was
over the valley. The stockade In which
they were confined consists of a large
inclosure surrounded by a double fence
of barbed wire, fifteen feet high. This
was cut through with some sort of an
instrurhent.
Rodeo rifle range is sltuate&Jn a val
ley about two miles back of Fort Bak
er and a short distance from Bolinas
Bay. The range was constructed early
this year under the supervision of
Lieutenant W. H. Patterson, Twenty
eighth Infantry, and has been in con
stant use all summer. This fall it was
decided to make some improvements
on the range proper, and new roads
are in course of construction. To ac
complish this work the Government or
dered that 100 prisoners be sent from
Alcatraz, and Major Alexis R. Paxton,
Thirteenth Infantry, commander of
that post, was told to select the men
for the detail. This he did about
three weeks ago and the prisoners
were sent to the. range. Major Paxton
says the men selected were those that
were in for minor offenses. Since they
have been at Rodeo they have worked
hard. 'No complaints have been made
by them, and in fact they all seemed
to like the place.
The guard sent to watch the prison
ers was composed of Companies C and
G, Thirteenth Infantry, and Company
M, Tenth Infantry. ' in command of
Captain Arthur Johnson, who was
also in- charge of the camp. .Captain
Johnson is at a loss to understand
how the escape was effected. At the
immediate point where the break was
made there happened to be a recruit
on duty, and it is probably due to^a
lack of vigilance on his part that the
men got away. As s&on as the escape
was discovered, a provost guard of
twenty-flve men was sent In pursuit
of the fugitives, but no trace of them
was found and late yesterday afternoon
the provost guard returned to the
camp." . . * . ' . . â  ; â¢ . : '*.

DAVIS. FEARS
AMES' PISTOL
When Thomas Davis left the United
States District Court room yesterday
his way to liberty he was closely
guarded by United States Marshal
Shine and Deputy Dingley until he had
boarded a horse-car for the ferry.
Davis had just been acquitted of the
charge of making a brutal attack upon
Mrs. A. H. Ames in her stateroom on
the steamer Alliance on October 15 of
last year. This was his third trial, the
former juries having disagreed.
* Mrs. Ames is the wife of a farmer re
siding at . Marshfleld, Or. The indig
nant husband "paced the corridor out
side the courtroom during the trial. He
is a determined looking man, and to
prevent him from' 1 assaulting the pris
oner Marshal Shine took Ames into
his office last Monday evening and dis
armed him of a large revolver. At 3:45
p. m. yesterday, when the Jury, after
having been out since noon, reported
In favor of acquitting Davis, Ames was
at the Winchester Hotel obtaining
medical assistance for his wife, who
was on the verge of collapse.
Beads of perspiration stood on Davis"
face as he stepped out of the
Appraiser's building, at the corner of
Sansome and Washington streets and
looked about him, while his guards
stood about twenty feet on each side
of him on the watch for the vengeful
husband. Not more than a half min
ute elapsed before a horse-car bound
for the ferry came along. Davis
stepped quickly upon the front plat
form and heaved a sigh of relief at his
escape.

SLOW TO BRING
ABOUT THE END
Attorneys in Dolbeer Case
Busy in Final Effort to
Strengthen Contentions
MISS WAGNER ON STAND
Incidentally Gives Defini
tion That Enjoins Use
of Term "Society Girl"
The proponents did not close their'
case In the Dolbeer will contest yes- '
terday, as was expected. It is not cer- I
tain they will conclude to-day, for in |
taking the last survey they may de- '
cide to call one or two more witnesses, ,<
whose testimony* would probably hold
the attention of the court till to-mor- i
row. !
The attorneys for the contestant
were unable to say yesterday how
much time they would take for testi
mony in rebuttal. . While the end is
Impending, the lawyers are slow to re
linquish' their open way to the witness
stand.
To expedite matters Judge Coffey re
fuses to hear argument on the more
trivial objections raised by the attor
neys. "I don't want to restrict coun
sel unfairly, but I do want to finish
this trial some time in the present gen
eration." he announced yesterday.
More testimony was offered to prove
the sanity of the testatrix. The most
important witness of the day was Miss
Helen F. Wagner. Other than Miss
Warren, she was Miss Dolbeer's most
intimate friend, and a bequest of $5000
in the will attests this close friend
ship. The witness was in almost dally
company of the testatrix until the day
of Miss Dolbeer's departure for Eu
rope. . The relations between them
were such that confidences were mu
tually exchanged.
In revealing some of these on the
witness stand much light was thrown
by Miss Wagner on the estimable
character, of Miss Dolbeer. In one of
the numerous confidential chats matri
mony was discussed in a general way.
"I couldn't care for" a man because of
his money," Miss Dolbeer had said. "I
would never marry a title, for I think
that is foolish. Nor could I marry a
foreigner: I would marry none but an
American. Social position has no at
traction for me. The man whom I
would marry must' have a work to do â
he must be a man of active affairs
and accomplish something in the
world. He must have the quality of
earnestness in life. Social position and
money are not enough. I care too much
for the life of k happy home and the
affection in it."
Miss Wagner also described the
many automobile trips, social affairs
and other diversions from which Miss
Dolbeer derived much enjoyment.
In all the intimate relations of their
friendship the witness never detected
a sign of failing mind in the testatrix.
At the time the' will was executed.
Miss Wagner declared, Miss Dolbeer
was undoubtedly of sound mind.
DEFINES "SOCIETY GIRL.
The cross-examination was some
what severe. Among other things,
Miss Wagner denied that Miss Dolbeer
was "a society girl," and when called
on gave the following as her definition
of the term:
"A society girl is one who goes out
all the time, is frivolous, has no serious
thought in life, cares nothing for home
or for love and affection, and is with
out deep feeling or emotion." â â¢*
Miss Dolbeer was not such a girl In
any particular, said the witness.
"That's not my. life either," she fur
ther declared, when asked what part
she took in society. 1
Miss Dolbeer wrote several letters to
Miss Wagner after leaving San Fran
cisco â¢ in April, but witness presented
only one of them. It was t written in
Paris a little over a month previous to
the death of the testatrix In New York.
To show that Miss Dolbeer was then
in happy frame of mind and as indica
tive itself of a rational and sane mind
the missive was introduced in evidence.
In the date line the testatrix made a
facetious use of French, with which
she was struggling during her stay in
Paris. The letter tells in a happy vein
how she was enjoying herself and goes
far to deny the contention that she
was in ill-health and disturbed mind
while participating in the gayeties of
the French capital.
William W. Carson, cashier for Dol
beer & Carson Company, told of the
intelligence and good ' judgment ex
hibited by the testatrix in looking aft
er her business affairs. The witness
is a son of William Carson, one of
the heads of the firm, and had been a

since childhood. For some time he
lived at her home on. Pacific avenue.
Young Carson was a witness to the
first will the testatrix made in 1903. He
knew nothing of the second will, which
was executed In April of the present
year. In March or April, the witness
couldn't remember which, Miss Dolbeer
one evening asked him how to spell
the plural of executrix, which request
he was not able to comply with. ; :â :;
NEW USE OF PHOTOGRAPH.
The proponents introduced a pho
tograph of Miss Dolbeer and It was
scrutinized by the Jury. It Is some
what new in legal practice to employ
photographs to supplement the testi
mony of witnesses as to the appear
ance of a person and the portrayal of
character. Fortified by a New York
decision Judge Coffey granted the re
quest of the proponents.
The opinion of J. Stanley Foster, as
sistant cashier of the Bowery Bank,
New York, that Miss Dolbeer was of
sound mind was added to the heap of
cumulative testimony on this point.
In the deposition read to the jury. Fos
ter, said he was a passenger* on the
Deutschland. on which the testatrix
and Miss Warren crossed to Europe.
Deponent had many conversations
with Miss Dolbeer and she was at all
times rational and coherent.
William G. Mugan. one of the ex
ecutors of. the will, was recalled and
asked if he did not say to Arthur H.
Barendt, then a reporter, on the re
ceipt of the news from New York of
Miss Dolbeer's death that he feared it
was only "too true," Is intimated in
the dispatch, that she had lost her
mind. The witness made emphatic
denial.
The trial will be resumed this morn
