CHEFU, Aug. 11.â According to the
latest information from Part Arthur
the Japanese bombarded the town on
August 9, placing their batteries in
dense kaolin fields, where they were
effectually masked. The shells drop
ped mainly in the western basin, where
the squadron was anchored. Many of
the shells fell upon the battleship Ret
vizan, but no serious damage was done,
either to the town or to the fleet. Later
the forts got the range of the Japanese
field batteries and drove them out from
their shelter. In the kaolin..

strangers and fairly tore him away
from her husband, whom she supposed
to be dead. She succeeded also in
wrenching the revolver from his hand.
Then the dog took part in the scuffle
and the two men turned In flight and
escaped in the darkness.

It is denied at the Admiralty that the
squadron left Port Arthur because the
situation of the fortress was desperate.
The Admiralty authorities say, it Is
more than likely that, with the Japan

fortress, the warships were unable to
The family of Lieutenant Smirnoff,
an, officer of the battleship Cesarevitch,
this evening received a telegram from
him, dated at Tsingchau to-day. The
message contained only two words:
"Alive; embraces."
Tsingchau is 160 miles southwest of
Chefu, in the Province of Shantung,
and is at the entrance of Kiaochau
Bay. The receipt of this telegram
might be construed as partial confirma
tion of the rumor that the squadron
had reached the open, sea beyond Shan
tung. .In no other way can Lieutenant
Smirnoff's family explain the message
from Tsingchau.
It is hardly believed that the squad
ron itself put into Kiaochau. It is re
garded as more likely that one of the
torpedo boat destroyers was sent there
with official dispatches and filed Lieu
tenant Smirnoff's telegram.
The news of the dismantling of the
torpedo-boat Ryeshitelni at Chefu has
not caused surprise. It is understood
that she was deliberately sacrificed so
that Vice Admiral Skrydloff might be
apprised of the departure of the Rus
sian vessels from Port Arthur, in order
that he might start out with the Vlad
ivostok squadron for the purpose of
meeting them.
ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 12.â Public
anxiety regarding the fate of the Port
Arthur fleet, which had reached the
highest pitch, remained unrelieved
when the people of St. Petersburg re
tired to-night. The reports from Toklo
and Chefu of the sea fight which fol
lowed the departure of the squadron
are so conflicting and inconclusive that
a strong hope exists that the Russian
Fhips succeeded in breaking through
the Japanese fleet. Indeed, it is rumored
late to-night that the Admiralty had
received information that the squadron
had passed beyond the Shantung
promontory (which, would bring the
squadron at least 150 miles to the
southeast of Port Arthur and into the
Yellow Sea).
The persistent report that Lieutenant
General'** Llnevitch . is moving from
Vladivostok toward Mukden with from
20,000 to 30,000 men lends color. to this
version. It also is pointed out that, if
tho Russians took" such care to fortify
Llaoyang,' itwas'with a' .view to'hold
ing it against" a superior force.. .'.Â¦
; Notwithstanding these considerations
of a purely military character, .the be
lief is : very prevalent outside as well
as , inside the War" Office . that ; General
Kuropatkin has made up\ his mind to
ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 12, 2:25 a.
m.â Even with the absorbing topic of
the escape of the Port Arthur squad
ron, the question' vhether General
Kuropatkin will accept or refuse a. gen
eral engagement at Liaoyang continues
to be a subject of the"" liveliest interest.
Opinions differ In military as well as
civilian circles, and the prof bund ignor
ance* regarding General Kuropatkin's
plans is v shown in the different views
held by 'the members of the general
start*. Experts of the Bureau of Opera
tions : incline to the belief that a col
lision between the main forces is in
evitable., Colonel Dbororlaky, assistant
chief of the bureau, said:. -.
Â¦ "Speaking from a \ purely . military
point of viev/, I do not see how a com
bat can be avoided at this stage. Per
sonally," I am not inclined to attach
credence to the. reports that our army
is already moving northward. - The
withdrawal of a large force In the face
of; a: superior .foe, closely .pressing our
position to the eapt and south, would
involve the risk of an * immediate at
tack, which would find us in a position
jbf still greater inferiority. " ,
"There are' two other conditions re
maining: Firstly, .there is at Liaoyang
kri, enormous . accumulation of stores,
which it would-vbe" necessary to sacri
fice; and, secondly, the Russians- are
in possession of fortifications of excep
tional strength, ' which discount the
numericahsuperiorlty of, the" foe!"
; If Colonel .Dbororlaky's view be cor
rect, Generai : Kuropatkin might reason
ably expect- to hold out' at Liaoyang
for some. time, 'and he could even stand
a siese and 'be ablu- to depend on -his
enormous stores to feed his a.rmy (in
case the' Japanese cut off his communi
cation) pending the arrival" of rein
forcements from the north.

. '"A small expedition of about 200
men under Eieutenant Colonel Van

Alaland3, parts of North Sumatra.
The Alalands were well armed, but
their guns do not carry as far as those
of our troops and in order to over
come this disadvantage their leaders,
being well aware of the disinclination
of our men to harm women and chil
dren, placed them in front of their
fighting line as a living screen. The
women and children are sometimes
armed and have often fired ct our
troops.
"Sheltered by this screen the natives
often allowed our men to approach
within point blank range of their posi
tions. Then they discharged an over
whelming' fire. In almost all engage
ments they have followed the same tac
tics, though repeatedly warned by our
officers. As a rule our troops withhold
their fire as Ions as possible, but they
dare not run the risk of being over
whelmed by a sudden rush of the na
tives from behind their living wall, and
are often forced to fire regardless of the

CHEFU, Aug. 12. â It now appears certain that the entire Port Arthur fleet, with the exception of several torpedo-boats, which were left to defend the harbor entrant
the battleships Retvizan and Pobieda, which'were damaged during the fight with Admiral Togo's ships and returned to the protection of the forts, has succeeded in eluding the Japanese
cordon. A portion of the fleet put into the German port of Kiaochou last night and other vessels have been sighted' at different points. Apparently the Russians, after cutting their way
through the Japanese fleet, scattered and took different directions in ord^r to render pursuit more difficult. It has been learned that the reason for the fleet's exit from the harbor was
that the Japanese had got the vessels' range from the Wolf Hills and were dropping explosive shells into the harbor.

CHEFU, Aug. 11.â Officers of the
Russian torpedo boat destroyer Rye
shttelni. express the opinion that Port
Arthur cannot be taken. They said
to-day that the' surroundings of the
town were covered, with corpses, but
the Russian losses were small.
The Russian fleet that left the har
bor consisted ; of six battleships and
four cruisers. Four .gunboats and half
of the torpedo flotilla remained behind.
The Russians intend to proceed to ;
Vladivostok, where, it is hoped; the
fleet will be reinforced by some cruis
ers purchased from Argentina.
Three days ago the Japanese at
ta'cked" the" main line of fortifications.
The infantry made recklessly brave
bayonet charges and the Russians rer
plied in a- similar, manner. . Steel to
steel conflicts took place and whole
regiments were annihilated.
STOESSEJj CHEERS HIS MEN.
The Russians were worn out from*
their heavy duty, and men dropped
from exhaustion by the side of their
guns. GeneralStoessel rode along the
line, urging them to be brave' for God
and their fatherland.
At daylight the Japanese concentrat
ed their reserves and made one final
attack^ irr which they swept the Rus
sians back arid captured Taku Moun
tain. In one fortified position, out of
a force of 200 men only two survived.
More than half succumbed to exhaus
tion. | k
On Tuesday last the Russians made,
a stealthy attack, crawling among
rocks and up mountainsides. The first
line' rushed the Japanese outposts and
fighting ensued at close quarters.
Simultaneously the Russian fleet
opened fire with its guns. Finally Taku
Mdantain was recaptured by the Rus
sians, who now hold the main line.
The carnage is described as ghastly.
FIGHTING IS TERRIFIC.
LIAOYANG, Aug. 11.â A refugee
from Port Arthur says the defenders
of the fortress remain all day at their
posts in spite of the awful heat, the
women heroically carrying water to the
parched soldiers, although not a sin
gle space within the perimeter of the
fortress is free from bullets and burst
ing shells. Sometimes the whole fort
ress seems enveloued in smoke from
the countless shell explosions.
There was a memorable sight from
the Wolf hills when the Japanese at
tacked the Russian positions there on
July 25. Five Japanese divisions moved
across the plain to the assault, under
cover of their guns. The onset was
so desperate that it almost verged on
frenzy. It was 6aid at Port Arthur
that Field Marshal Oyama commanded
the Japanese forces in person and sev
eral Princes of the blood and veteran
generals led the attacking forces, giv
ing surpassing examples of courage.
The Japanese artillery received a fresh
supply of ammunition â¢ the . previous
evening, and never before was thÂ«Â»re
such a terrific; hail of projectiles, but
the efforts of the Japanese were . un
availing against the determined stand
of the Russians, who proved them
selves worthy suns of the defenders of
Sebastopol, and the attack was re
pulsed with enormous losses. The refu
gee gives the Russian losses at 1500
and those of the Japanese at 10.000.
After the battle General Stoessel or
dered out every availablo surgeon to
dress the Jpp?jnese woundefi, but the
F.i'ssians vure unable to brins then

tions are being completed here for the
reception and protection of the Port
Arthur squadron. The departure of
the squadron from Port Arthur is gen
erally interpreted to indicate that the
siege of the fortress is entering on its
final stage. The smaller ships. probably
were left behind on account of their
slow speed and Inadequate fighting
power, while the torpedo-boat destroy
ers would constitute a constant men
ace to the Japanese fleet outside.
It Is believed the purpose of the Rus
scian torpedo-boat destroyer Ryeshi
telni In going to Chefu was to notify
Admiral Skrydloff of the sortie of the
Port Arthur squadron, in order that he
may dispatch the Vladivostok squadron
to meet the squadron from Port Ar
thur.

The result of the battle was not known
in Port Arthur and nothing definite
had been learned regarding either
squadron, except that the Russian ves
sels did not return.
Wednesday is said to have been
chosen for the escape of the Russian
warships at Port Arthur because- the
Japanese fleet was then exhausted by
the constant bombardment of the two
previous nights. The fleet left Port
Arthur in response to imperative or
ders from Vice Admiral Skrydloff.-
A semi-official telegram reports that
the -Russian battleships -Pobieda amV
Retvlzan have returned damaged, to
Port Arthur.
An official source here reports the
sighting of sixteen Russian warships
last night in. the vicinity of Chefu. It
is alleged that the Russian hospital
ship Mongolia, carrying women and
children, which left Port Arthur with
the squadron, will go to Shanghai. â¢
The Russian. battleship Revizan was
hit seventeen, times during the recent
bombardment of Port Arthur, but was
only slightly damaged.
The Japanese fleet has been direct
ing its flre against the dockyards, at
Port Arthur. One hundred shells
dropped on a spot from which a pow
der magazine had recently been re
moved.
The Japanese are reported to be lack
ing'in sufficient large guns. The pres
ent supply is mostly from the fleet.
Captain Shestakovsky, of the Rus
sian torpedo-boat destroyer, which ar
rived here this morning, reports that
a Japanese cruiser and a gunboat were
damaged during the past week. He is
not positive, however, that they sank.
It is reported that the Japanese pro
tected cruiser Kasaga was sunk off
Round Island in the recent engage
ment. Round Island is forty-eight miles
east of Port Arthur.
The Russian ships before leaving
Port Arthur took on board heavy
stores, machinery and materials for
ship repairing.
WTLTj SAIL WITH CONTRABAND.
Tremont to Ijeave Seattle With a
Large Cargo for Japan.
SEATTLE, Aug. 11.â When the
Boston Steamship Company's liner
Tremont sails from here on Saturday
morning she will carry 14,000 tons of
freight for the Orient, including a
vast amount of foodstuffs for Japan.
In the cargo now being loaded are
280,000 sacks of flour, of which 100,
000 sacks are going to China and the
remainder to Japan.
The vessel also will carry about
400 tons of field supplies for the
army in the Philippines, but no arms
or ammunition.
Russia Will Not Recede.
ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 11. â At
the Foreign Office here the question of
revising the list of contraband is not
under, consideration and there is little
likelihood of any modifications being
made in the Russian declarations at
present. Nevertheless the Novostt
urges the acceptance of the American
and British views in order to prevent
causes for discontent among neutral
powers.
TORONTO SUITS
THE PRINTERS
Canadian City Is Selected
as Next Meeting Place of
the Typographical Union
ST.. LOUIS, Aug. 11.â The Interna
tional Typographical Union convention
to-day selected Toronto, Canada, as the
place at which to hold the next annual
convention.
During to-day's session it was voted
to increase the annual salaries of the
president and secretary-treasurer from
$1800 to $2500. The matter was then re
ferred to the referendum for final ac
tion.
The report of the committee on re
ports of officers showed the growth of
the International Typographical Union
during the past year. The report also
declared the^Tmion officers unalterably
opposed to open shops.
The report was unanimously ac
cepted.
A sharp tilt occurred between Dele
gate William A. Greene of Indianap
olis and President Lynch over the pub
lication of a letter reflecting on a can
didate during the last campaign.
Delegate Greene accused President
Lynch with having resorted to some
alleged questionable methods to secure
the defeat of a candidate for president
during the last campaign.
President Lynch took the floor and
denied that he had resorted to the
measures charged.
Delegate Greene charged President
Lynch with falsehood.
Instantly the convention was In com
motion.
After considerable discussion the mo
tion was referred back to the commit
tee on laws for .further consideration.
Duties in Canal Zone
In connection" with the report from
Panama of dissatisfaction with the
requirements that steamers clearing
from La Boca must receive their
clearance papers from the American
authorities, it is stated by the Pana
ma Canal Commission that there can
be no" possible misinterpretation of
the. canal treaty Involved in thaV or
der. La Boca, it is pointed out, la
about a mile back from the ocean and
is clearly within the canal zone. The
Panamans also complain ; of the diffl
culty v of replacing the revenue lost to
the republic by allowing goods from
the United States to enter the; canal
zone free of duty, which they fear will
be smuggled into the Panama republic.
The provision for this free entry was
made so as to conform to other ports
of American territory. ' All goods
whether free or dutiable entering the
canal zone in any way. must come
through the custom house of the_re
spective collection districts, and the
governor of the canal zone is already
authorized ' make an agreement with
the President of Panama for co-opera
tion of the customs services of "the
two governments to prevent frauds
and smuggling. . - - â " '

a hurried order in a low tone, the words
not being distinguishable to the inter
preter. Immediately, it is alleged, the
captain seized the Japanese lieutenant
and jumped overboard with him.
Meanwhile the Japanese destroyers
had their searchlights turned on the
Russian ship. From the deck of the
lightship observers could see this act,
which was followed by the. shooting of
rifles and saber strokes and Russians
jumping overboard.
JAPANESE HOIST THEIR FLAG. .
The fighting had lasted ten minutes,
when an explosion followed. The ex
plosion blew away the Â»main bridge,
but did no damage to the hull. The
Russians by this time were mostly all
overbtrard. The Japanese at once
hoisted- -their flag.--
Presently a searchlight from the
Chinese cruiser Haichi disclosed a
Chinese cutter alongside 'the Asashio.
It remained th'ere only -a -minute and
then went alongside the Kasumi,
where it stopped an equal length of
time. The- cutter then returned to the
Haichi.
The inaction of the Chinese fleet is
unexplained so far. It is believed seri
ous international complications will re
sult from the incident.
There are unconfirmed stories in cir
culation, that the Japanese fired at the
Russians when they were in the water
and that they refused to rescue any of
them. ' . '
The Japanese Consul claims that the
Japanese ships were ignorant of the
dismantling of the Ryeshitelni. An As
sociated Press representative, however,
informed the Japanese naval officers of
the fact when he visited the two Japa
nese destroyers at 2:30 o'clock this
morning, soon after Admiral Sah's visit.
The passengers brought here aboard
the Ryeshitelni include two women, one
of whom is believed to be the wife of
General Stoessel, commander of the
military forces at Port Arthur.
The disarmament of.the Ryeshitelnl
was completed last night and her fla&
was hauled down, the crew singing
the national anthem. Tears coursed
down the cheeks of Captain Shesta^
kovsky during the ceremony. It was
evident all the preceding day that the
necessity of abandoning his ship,
which had served him so well, greaU
ly affected the captain, who won conÂ«
siderable renown while at Port ArÂ«
thur. It is thought that when he dis
cerned the purpose of the Japanese
he gave a hurried order to blow up
the ship, intending to end his life and
that of his assailants with the ship.
CHEFU, Aug. 12. â Japanese naval of
ficers have committed a grave breach
of international rights that may at once
Involve their nation in difficulties with
China, or, if China fail to act, with the
ally of Russia. They have attacked,
captured and towed from the harbor
of Chefu a dismantled Russian torpedo
boat ; destroyer that had been placed
under the protection of the Chinese
Government. The seizure of the vessel
was attended by a fierce fight, in which
the Russian commander was killed. -
Immediately after the arrival here of
the Ryeshitelni with news that the
Russian fleet had escaped from Port
Arthur, Chinese Admiral Sah boarded
her and demanded that she either dis
arm and disable her engines or leave
port. The captain of the Russian ves
sel accepted the former alternative.
The Ryeshitelni was dismantled and
was assigned by Admiral Sah to a per
manent anchorage, where she was to
have remained until the end of the war.
During the night two Japanese tor
pedo-boat destroyers which had fol
lowed the Ryeshitelni from Port Arthur
stole into the harbor under cover of
darkness and showing no lights. When
their presence was discovered, soon
after midnight, they were visited by
the Chinese admiral, with the same de
mand that had been made to the Rus
sian captain.
RUSSIAN VESSEL ATTACKED.
Ignoring his demand, at 3:30 o'clock
this morning the Japanese destroyers,
which were the Asashio and the Ka
eumi, sent a boarding party against the
Ryeshitelnl. After a fierce fight the
boarding party hoisted the Japanese
flag on the Ryeshitelni and towed her
out of the harbor in a northerly direc
tion.
Of her crew of forty-seven,' seventeen
have been accounted for. Captain
Shestakovsky is reported killed. Seven
swam ashore, landing near the Ameri
can Consulate. Some were picked up
by sampans, and three, including a
lieutenant, were rescued by a light
ship.
The Japanese claim that they sent In
a gig to the Ryeshitelnl, under a flag
of truce, a lieutenant and interpreter,
who made a demand that the Russians
come outside and fight.. The Russian
captain replied that his ship had been
disarmed, .her engines disabled and
that the vessel was in the hands of the
Chinese. The Japanese were asked to
investigate the disarmament.
The Japanese interpreter claims that

ONE WOMAN'S STRANGE
POWER OVER ANOTHER
The refusal of the steamship lines en
fcaged in the carrying trade between the
port of San Francisco and the Orient
lo accept freight consigned to a mining
company in Korea has led to a call for
A conference of the directors of the
Chamber of Commerce, the Board of
Trade of San Francisco, the Manufac
turers' a-nd Producers' Association and
the Merchants' Association, to be held
In the rooms of the Chamber of Com
merce this afternoon. The purpose of
the conference is to discuss the situa
tion as it relates to the commerce of
the Pacific Coast with the Orient and
to take such action as may be neces
sary to call to the attention of the
l>epartment of State at Washington
the needs and wishes of the people of
this coast. Important results may fol-
Jow. Representatives of the steamship
lines may be present at the conference.
This action is reported to have orig
inated with Andrew Carrigan of the
Dunham, Carrigan & Hayden Com
pany. The goods for Korea which
were denied transportation were
supposed by this firm to be non-con
traband. When it was discovered that
there was no way to semd them directly
from San Francisco. Carrigan prepared
a communication that was sent to the
commercial bodies, in which he setfa
forth the facts as they appeared to
him.
" '"If." says Carrigan, "this condition
'of affairs Is allowed to continue for
even a short period of sixty or ninety
days a large portion of our trade with
Japan and Korea will undoubtedly be
diverted to other channels, to the seri
ous and possibly permanent loss of San
Francisco. The history of trade shows
that it is difficult to build up with for
eign countries, and that to maintain
and increase such trade calls for con
stant and careful attention, and if such
trade be diverted into other channels
"the greater portion, if recovered at all.
vill be recovered only after years of
hard work. In other words, the fabric
of our foreign trade can be pulled to
pieces in a very short time and can be
rebuilt only by years of exertion."
The presidents of the commercial
bodies have called their directors to the
conference of to-day, at which issues of
great concern will be discussed. Mr.
Carrigan declares that the merchants
and manufacturers of San Francisco
ehould immediately recognize their
danger. He insists that the steamship
companies explain the issuance of such
drastic orders, also that the conference
go further and appeal to the Govern
ment for such jirotection of non-con
traband cargoes as will enable the or
dinary commerce of this port to pro
ceed undisturbed.
â¢At the conference to-day a Bpecial
committee may be appointed to secure
protection for- the manufacturers, car
riers and merchants of the entire Pa
cific Coast, from San Diego to teattle,
by clearly defining their rights Â«nd ob
ligations in the premises in order to
preserve the foreign trade, which has
been built up to its present condition
by years of hard labor and large outlay
of capita), and to permit and foster the
extension of. euch trade.

Sirs. Cords SaJd to Have Borrowed
Large Sums From Mrs. Clark
on Unsecured Xotes.
A suit was begun in the Superior
Court yesterday for the recovery of
$18,225. alleged to be due on seven
promissory notes executed in 1901 and
1:902 by Mathilde R. <J*ords in favor of
Ann E. Clark. The /notes are unse
cured and represent money borrowed
from a woman now dead. Mrs. Clark
died January 21\ 1903, and her estate
is being administered in Sacramento
County by Mrs. Rose M. Biggs and
Mrs. Addie Clark Norton, Mrs. Clark's
daughters, who are the plaintiffs in
the action for the recovery of the
money. Their attorney is J. C. Bates.
The first note was dated March 8,
1901, and was for $5000. Another
one for the same amount was dated
July 17, and the others were for from
$125 to $3500.
Attorney Bates declares that Mrs.
Cords was a stranger to the woman
from whom she succeeded in borrow
ing such large sums and that Mrs.
Clark, although more than 70 years
old, was apparently in her right mind.
Mrs. Cords obtained the large loans
and gave her unsecured notes there
for. Besides getting all of the money
Mrs. Clark had on deposit in a local
bank, it is said that the old lady bor
rowed between $6000 and $8000 from
D. O. Mills & Co in order to accommo
date the demands of Mrs. Cords. The
borrower is the secretary of the Pine
Needle Company at 364 Sutter street.

Warrant Out for Arrest of George E.
Bosworth on Charge of Defraud
ing an Innkeeper.
Mrs. Margaret Adams, who keeps a
lodging-house at 29 Eddy street, se
cured a warrant yesterday for the ar
rest of George E. Bosworth on a
charge of defrauding an innkeeper.
She was accompanied by Bosworth's
wife and his mother-in-law. It is
claimed that Bosworth represented
himself as a wealthy mining man and
invited the young lady* who subse
quently became his wife, and her
mother, to live at 29 Eddy street,
where he had a room. They contin
ued to live there after the marriage,
about a month ago, until Bosworth
disappeared a few days ago without
paying his room rent. He is supposed
to have left the city.
"I found," said Mrs. Bosworth, a.
tall, willowy brunette, "that my hus
band was nothing but an adventurer.
He paid the clergyman who married
us with a check which was fictitious.
He borrowed my . gold watch and
pawned it and* also borrowed as much
money, as he could from me and my
mother. I hope he is caught."
The Tiniest of 3Ianuscripts.
One of the tiniest manuscripts ever
recorded is a little Bible in a walnut
shell the size of a small hen's eee, an
account of which has been preserved
among the Harleian manuscripts by
Peter Bales, an Englishman, and a
clerk of the .chancery. It contained as
many leaves as a large Bible and as'
much reading matter on each page. 1
With a powerful glass it could be read
easily. The author of this tiniest book 1
on record lived in the time of Queen
Elizabeth, and in 1575 presented her
Majesty with the Lord's prayer, the
creed, ten commandments, two short
Latin prayers, his own name and
motto and the date, all written on a
bJt of paper the size of a finger-nail,
and set/ in a ring of gold covered with
a crystal. In this case also a magni
fying glass made the writing quite

ATASCADERO, Aug. 11.â From early
dawn the camp has been a scene of
life and action. There has not been
a moment in the day that evolutions
of one kind or another have not been
going on. On the great camp field the
review and parade of the Fifteenth In
fantry, Lieutenant .Colonel Pratt com
manding, at sundown to-night was a
beautiful sight. It was thrown into
bold relief by the oak-covered hills,
which made a stunning background for
the troops in their khaki uniform. :
General MacArthur made another
detour to-day of the country sur
rounding the camp and on his return
said: "I am more than pleased with
this place for these maneuvers. The
more I see of the topography of the
ranch the better I like it. The supply
of water here Is so far more than suffi
cient for our needs and shows no signs
of diminution. I am looking forward
with great interest to the battle exer
cises which are now on the eve of be
ginning."
The main feature of the day was the
hospital drill at reduced distances un
der command of Colonel A. C. Girard.
The entire corps of the medical depart
ment of over, 100 men took part.. It
was divided into two brigades, Major
William Stephenson cpmmanding the
first and. Major Kendall as commander
of the second. The wounded were first
conveyed on stretchers from the scene
of theÂ»supposed conflict to, the am
bulance station, thence to the dressing
station and afterward to the field hos
pital. . . - â¢ .
Everything was carried out as is ob
served in actual warfare. The drill was
a great success, being realistic in the
extreme.
General MacArthur has under con
sideration taking the entire division
out to bivouac for one night. This .will
be the real thing in the way of army
battle exercise and will give the mili
tia a taste of going'over a rough coun
try and at the same time packing their
blanket rolls, rations, haversacks and
canteens. ' . - : .;
This morning the provisional regi
ment went through battalion and regi
mental extended order drill, Colonel
W. L. Pitcher commanding. Major

That portion of , the building, to
which the fire was confined is occupied

establishment was gutted by fire about
a year ago. She says that the origin
of the . fire Is a mystery to her. . Ac
cording to her statement she was In
one of the rooms and upon discovering
the flames crawled through a window
to a neighboring roof. The damage
will exceed 51000. Miss Dean carried
$400 insurance on her furniture.
Mystery and suspicion cloud" the
origin of a fire which last night badly
gutted the second floor of the two
story frame building at 1055 Market
street. An investigation -by the au
thorities may result in a criminal
prosecution for arson. From Informa
tion given to the police by. John Soder
qulst. quartermaster of the lighthouse
tender Madrona, the fire appears to
have been the work of an incendiary.
Soderquist and a companion named
Gustafson were walking past the
building about 9:45 o'clock and de
tected smoke issuing from the door
way. Soderquist rushed up the stair
way and found the steps blazing with
oil. A quart can of kerosene was
blazing furiously near the top of the
stairs, and, seizing this he rushed to
the street. Conrad Michel of 313

of the ' river steamer T. C. Walker,
who were, standing on the sidewalk,

An alarm was turned In from box

the , flames were found i shooting
through the roof, but the fire was soon
brought under control. An Investi
gation showed that the flames had
started in the rear of the building and
swept . through the hall, doing con
siderable damage. This seems to in
dicate that' it may have been started
in two places at the same time. .

Secretary Taft lo-day addressed the
largest audience that has gathered at
ihe summer assembly for years, his
subject being: "Our Duty in the Philip
pines."
Secretary Taft said the English stu
dent of colonial government thought
much more popular control had been
conferred on the people of the Philip
pine Islands than was wise, while the
American critics, who, he said, "like to
style themselves anti-impeiialists, con
demn the course of the United States
in the Islands on the ground that suf
ficient self-government has not been
'xtonded to the Filipinos." He be
lieved that the course taken was some
what near the golden rule.
The problem before this Government,
he said, v.as lio*,v best to educate the
Filipinos for self-government. The
first step taken was the education of
the present generation in the primary
rr.d secondary schools and in Knglish.
It was a matter of conjecture how long
the process of education of the people
will take, but it should be continued
long enough under American auspices
to insure its continuance under the
auspices of the Filipinos, if they should
pee fit to establish an independent gov
ernment.
Continuing, he said:
"'If the government were now turned
over to the Filipino people without
American guidance, then we can be
sure that the whole fabric of the edu
cational system . established by the
American Government in the islands
will fall to pieces."

The statement has recently been made
by an English firm that they were no

because they could not compete with
the rice growers of Texas and cither
Southern States. The first five months

rice imported Into Germany, all of
which was received from India or Ja

"It had something to do with the

By this time Peter was slightly
groggy, but the commissioner was

"What's the constitution?" he was
asked.

NATIVE SONS TO GIVE
LARGE THEATER PARTY
ALAMEDA, Aug. 11.â Home, sweet
home, with good board and lodging,
family style', beats riding- on a~brake'
beam when one's stomach is empty. So
thinks 11-year-old Ernest Collinge, son
of Dr. and Mrs. J. E. Collinge of Ninth
street and San Antonio avenue, and the
little fellow knows from experience, for
he has just returned from a three days'
trial of "hittins the road."
"With Victor Suennan, who lives in
the same neighborhood and who is 17
years of age, Ernest went to Oakland
and acting under the orders of his com
panion secreted himself beneath a box
car attached to a freight train bound
East. At Port Costa they were detect
ed and driven away by brakemen.
What happened to young Collinge from
the time he left his happy hearthstone
until he returned unhappy is here given
as told by himself:
Victor and I first went to Oakland, where
I gave him all the money 1 had. $1 50. Then
we foun-J a freight tr-ii:i and Victor &nd I
climbed under a err an 1 .aui nurielvM ncusa
the brak<Â»beam.j '"A hÂ«?n i he irnlM s:amd Vic
tor said. "All aboard 'or the S*. Louts Tnlr
and Chicago." When the train was going fast
the gravel kept flying In my face, so that
I had to Shut my eyes and mouth.,' I told
Victor about it and he eald, "Spit out the
rocks. Ernis and turn your head th* other
way." Then I wished I was at home with
my moth-r anO had never heard of the St.
Louis Fair.
When the Uam 'Ktoppel at Port Coati *vo
were chased. fi:m under the cat. I didn't c.tro,
as I'd rather be ct ased a* mile than rlilo an
other foot on ihat Kiakebeam. ' The tint nlgl't
after we- '.eft .iome Victor <rnd Icrawln! into
a haystacx an! went to sle-T It was prctiy
cold and felt different from sleeping in
blankets. About the middle of the night three
hoboes came to the same haystack and kicked
us out of bed. Then we walked around in the
dark, and I tell you I was lonesome.
The second and third nights Victor and I
stopped in a lodging-house, where he rented
a bed. I was caught by a detective near Port
Costa and sent back home .on a passenger
train. Victor skipped and I don't know where
he went. I don"t think I will go to the St.
Louis Fair this year as Victor wanted me
to do.
Young Colllnge's mother says her boy
had never been away from home be
fore and that he was induced to leave
by young Suennan. The latter has
given his mother considerable trouble
by reason of his wild actions, and she
says that when she reprimanded him
and threatened to have him placed in a
reform institution he decided to run
away. He is supposed to be > beating
his way to St. Louis, and his parents
are in fear that he will meet with ac
cident on the road. The police of the
larger cities along the railway lines
have been asked to keep a lookout for
young Suennan.
"Parents had ample warning that
they must heed the law before the
present school term began. I think
that within a few days thlngrs wlfl have
settled down and we will be run
ning In our accustomed harmonious
yay."
OAKLAND, Aug. 11.â Parents who
cpject to compulsory vaccination of
their children have appeared at the
offices of the Board of Education and
threatened to institute mandamus pro
eeedlngrs to force the board to admit
the children, unvaccinated. to the pub
lic schools. Concerning this aspect of
the situation. City Superintendent of
Schools McClymonds said:
"Although we have been threatened
â¢*ith mandamus suits, there is abso
lutely no legal ground for them. Three
times the State Supreme Court has
affirmed the validity of the vaccination
law. I realize that enforcement of the
law has caused friction, but in view of
th* decided stand taken by the State
Board of Health no other course could
be taken.

NO CHANCE TO -WIN
Accidents to "Expert Horsewomen."
It Is surprising how constantly these
"expert horsewomen" are damaged by
runaways and carriage accidents, for
scarcely a day passes that we do not
hear of some young woman who la
counted a skillful whip being tossed out
of her trap, with the steed going on to
where the woodbine twineth. But It 13
no joking matter, for the fair driver's
friends and family, to have her picked
up for dead, with some Injury to her
good looks past repair. Can it be that
simple recklessness is the cause of these
many catastrophes, or Is It Ignorance
of the science of managing a horse? It
Is as much the fashion nowadays for
girls to ride and drive as it is for them
to play the piano and belong to a thou
sand and one classes and clubs of so
cial standing, but It does not fall to
every girl's lot to be a good and safe
driver. Granted there Is not a prettier
tableau vlvant than the well-mounted
equestrienne, and after that the well
turned out handler of ribbons over the
backs of prize winners; but she should
know her business and have a cool a3
well as an ornamental head on her
shoulders unless she wants to come to

In a short but interesting and witty little
talk Mrs. Scott gave a description of her
recent visit to Tahiti. She brought back a
fine collection of curios, which were inspected
with eager interest by her guests.
The decorations were also suggestive of the
islands, great stalks of green bamboo forming
an effective background for,. the clusters of
growing' cocoanuts, which were brought from
Tahiti by the Scotts and which formed a
very unique and artistic part or the decoration.
At the conclusion of Mrs. Scott's recital a
delicious repast was served, which proved to
be quite as original aa the rest of the after
noon's programme. Dainty concoctions of
frultfl, native to Tahiti, and cocoanut milk
were part of the menu served, a delicious brew
of native coffee concluding the unique collation.

TAH1T1AN TEA.
Little Willie was prolific with expla
nations when taken to the City Prison
to await the coming of his foster par
ent. He stoutly denied at the outset
that he had been away from home.
Later he amended that tale by an
nouncing that two men had driven him
out of the house about 9:30 o'clock last
evening while Massie and his wife were
absent. The boy insisted that this
was the reason why he had disappear
ed. He likewise said he had remained
all night in the lot where he was found
to-day. At all events, Massie was glad
enough to have the missing boy re
stored to him. *
In a vacant lot at Twelfth and
Chestnut streets, two blocks from his
home, Willie Massie, 10 years old, who
disappeared strangely last night from
the residence of his cousin and guar
dian, John A. Massie, at 1015 Linden
street, was found this afternoon by
Policeman Thomas Pardee. The boy
was not abducted and his reappearance
absolves Mrs. Nellie Massie, his moth
er, from suspicion that she knew any
thing about the youngster's absence.
John A. Massie declared last night
that his ward had been kidnaped.' He
linked his aunt's name with the disap
pearance because there had recently
been a contest in the courts over the
guardianship of the boy. Massie, who
has cared for his little cousin for sev
eral years, won the battle. He believed
that his aunt, the boy's mother, had
taken her son.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway. Aug. 11.
The growth of the agricultural or In
terior portion of the county has not
kept pace with the manufacturing sec
tion along the bay shore and the coun
ty will have to be redlstricted at some
time. Richmond wants a Supervisor
and is going to get one if It can.
The second district has for its cen
ters of population Walnut Creek and
Danville and the San Ramon Valley.
It is now represented by J. M. Stow of
Walnut Creek. He is the only Repub
lican on the board, though the county
is Republican as a whole. The third
district has E. J. Randall of Concord
for its representative and includes a
small section at the western base of
Mount Diablo. The fourth district Is
represented by Paul de Martini of
Clayton and comprises that town and
Black Diamond. The fifth district com
prises the eastern part of the county
and Antioch. It is represented by J.
D. Wightman. The present members,
except Stow, are all candidates for re
nomination by the parties to which
they belong. Stow will not again be
a candidate. Torney and Randall are
holdovers.
The redistricting of the county came
before the board upon the petition of
C. A. Odell, who asked the board a
week ago to take such action. At this
week's meeting the board decided to
drop the entire matter until after elec
tion. Odell is believed to represent a
desire upon the part of the growing
section of Richmond to have the su
pervisorial lines so drawn that a Su
pervisor would come from that city.
The present supervisorial districts of
Contra Costa were arranged when the
agricultural portion of the county con
tained the bulk of the population. But
the extensive water front along the
western shore, particularly, from Point
Richmond to Port Costa, has grown so
rapidly that now it contains fully one
half the population of the county. All
this coast, including the towns of
Richmond, .Stege, San Pablo, Pinole,
Hercules, Crockett. Port Costa and the
county seat, Martinez, are in Super
visorial District No. 1, which contains
more voters than the other four dis
tricts together. This district is now
represented by Patrick Tormey, who
still has two years to serve. In this
district a total of 2177 votes were cast
two years ago, -while the second dis
trict only cast B65 votes, the third dis
trict 454, the fourth district 308 and the
fifth district 759/ ?
The Board of Supervisors of Contra
Costa County has finally decided not to
redistrict the county before the coming
elsction. The Supervisors take as their
ground the fact that to make any
change now would cause confusion at
the coming election. They assert that
the present supervisorial district lines
are well known by the voters and that
to make a change upon the eve of an
election when three Supervisors are to
be elected would put both voters and
candidates to needless trouble and
confusion.

Dr. W. W. Allen, president of the
Board of Education; Dr. F. Oberg, J.
G-. Wright and the Rev. J. Stitt Wilson
attacked vaccination on the ground
that It is not a positive preventive of
smallpox, that it is fatal to many pa
tients and that it has affected human
health In many cases, particularly in
Increasing the tendency toward tuber
culosis.
C. F. Van Luven of Oakland and
Wilbur Walker of Oakland related
their experiences with vaccination and
the struggle that followed their efforts
to evade what they considered an un
just law. Van Luven said that he had
been compelled to take, his children
from the schools on account of the
law. Walker disclaimed any desire to
quarrel with those who advocate vac
cination, but did not deem it justice
that children should be excluded from
the schools because they were not vac
cinated. "It doesn't seem consistent,"
he said, "to exclude children from the
public schools and allow them to go
to private schools or to Sunday schools
or to mingle on the streets. There is
no question that the law is in force
and perhaps the only thing to do is
To seek its repeal. Tiut in my judgment
There 5s a legal remedy, even If the
courts have upheld the law.". .
That there Is a strong senti
ment among the people of Berkeley
agraisst vaccination was manifest to
night," when 300 of them met in Odd
Fellows' Hall and after listening to
stirring speeches pledged themselves to
protest with all their might before the
next Legislature against the compul
sory vaccination law. The opponents
of the measure banded themselves in
an anti-vaccination society and plan
to make this the nucleus for a great
association, composed of societies all
over the State, organized specifically
to fight for the repeal of the law. Dr.
W. W. Allen is president of the society,
Mrs. Eugenia C. Campbell the secretary
and "the Rev. J. Stitt Wilson treasurer.
'. Odd Fellows' Hall was crowded to
its capacity with men and women when
Chairman Thomas Harm called the
meeting: to order. A series of speeches,
directed against vaccination, met with
the approval of the protestants, the
feeling against the practice being in
tense.

Both victims of the accident are
members of Local Union No. 31, Bridge
and Structural Iron Workers. They live
in San Francisco.
The breaking: of a scaffolding plank
this afternoon at the new Hearst min
ing building on the university campus
precipitated two workmen to the
ground and perhaps fatally hurt one of
them. John Connolly was frightfully
bruised and was injured Internally.
Thomas Fay escaped with a severe
shaking up. The doctors say that Con
nolly may not live.
The men were at work painting the
steel structural work of the mining
building and were forty-eight feet
above the ground when the accident oc
curred. Their fall was caused by both
Btepping on the scaffolding plank at' the
same time. Under ordinary circum
stances the plank would not have
broken with their weight, but this one
happened to have a flaw In it.
In falling Fay went clear to the
ground and landed on a heap of cin
ders, which lessened the force of the
concussion. His comrade was less for
tunate, however, for in his downward
flight he struck a crossbeam and thus
received his injuries.
. The men were picked up a few min
utes after their fall by the other work
men, who at once sought medical aid.
Drs.'A. M. Carpenter and T. C. Mc-
Cleave treated Connolly temporarily
and then had him removed to the East
Bay Sanatorium, where he lies in a crit
ical condition. Fay was able to go home
with assistance.

Attorney. Perry is authority for the
statement that his client, Clark, will
Immediately sue the insurance firm
for $100,000 damages for defamation
of character.
Clark's attorney is G. H. Perry and
his complaint is -irected against J.
E. Bell and A. D. Harrison, doing an
insurance business as Catton, Bell &
Co. Clark avers that for ten years
prior to March 21, 1903, he was em
ployed ns general manager of the con
cern on a promise. of $7500 a year, be
sides a percentage of the proceeds -of
the business. He alleges that the firm
has failed to account for the percent
age due him and he sues for $18,000
upon the basis of his information as
to the amount of business done.
The suit against Clark is brought by
the firm through its attorney, Francis
J. Heney. They recite that they em
ployed Clark on June 30, 1899, at a
fixed salary and that his services ceas
ed March 31. 1903. They declare that
he has been in their debt, since De
cember 31, 1902. for $768148 under
a running open account agreed upon
between them, whereby the firm
loaned him money, paid his debts to
other persons and bought | goods for
him. When the account was balanced
the firm owed him $300 for services
and he was indebted for the difference
named.
There is a wide difference In the
opinions of W. F. Clark and Catton,
Bell & Co. as to the amounts of money
due from each to the other. Clark
says that the firm owes him $18,000,
and the firm declares that Clark is. in

NEW YORK, Aug. 11. â The strike
of the United Garment Workers
against the open shop, which began
about two months ago, Was declared
off. It is claimed by the employers
that the ranks of the strikers had
dwindled from 32,000 to 5000.
The strikers have made individual
agreements with the employers, but all
on an open shop basis, though in
many cases all the men taken back
will remain union men. It is esti
mated that the strikers lost between
$1,500,000 and $2,000,000 in wages. .

H. T. Scott said the Union Iron
Works would help out by launching the

vide them with transportation down

Admiral Whiting, commandant of the
Yerba Buena training station, said vis
itors would be taken to^Goat Island
and shown how the Navy Department
educated its sailors.
General Passenger Agent T. H. Good
man of the Southern Pacific Company
mentioned the preparations made by
the railroads all over the country to
handle the great crowds coming this
way next month. Many who had al
ready engaged transportation would
extend their visit to the State for
weeks.
FOR CONVENIENCE OF VISITORS.
Rolla V. Watt suggested that a cir
cular be prepared containing all infor
mation necessary for^he assistance of
the . strangers, as this had been done
with advantage when the Christian En.
deavorers were here.
Jacob Neff promised that an Interest
ing mineral exhibit would be made. In
reply to a question Colonel Pippy said
that arrangements had already been
made to lodge 16,000 visitors.
Mayor Scbmitz, called on for a sug
gestion, answered by promising his
hearty co-operation in every way In
any preparation the committee might
make.
* That no minor detail for the recep
tion of the visitors might be over
looked, a number of prominent citi
zens of San Francisco meet in the
Maple room of the Palace Hotel yes
terday afternoon to prepare a pro
gramme of entertainment. Colonel
George W. Pippy, as chairman, said
that the welcome for the strangers
must come also from the people of
this city and State and not alone from
the Knights Templar. No one could
begin to estimate, the chairman con
tinued, the benefits that would come
to San Francisco and to California
with the thirty or forty thousand
strangers, not alone in the vast sum
of money that would be spent by the
visitors on this coast, but in the
greater good that would spring from
an exhibition of this State and her re
sources. The local members of the or
der had prepared for the care of the
guests while In this city, but there
would be visits to other j parts of the
State and arrangements must be made
for these.'
It is probable that every civilized
state on the globe will contribute to
this conclave.
Hospitable San Francisco will meet
the great army of strangers at her
gates next month and their reception
will be splendid and thorough in its
cordiality. During the great Chris
tian Endeavor Convention here it was
estimated that 40.000 visitors lodged in
this city that week. The twenty-ninth
Triennial Conclave of the Knights
Templar, which will convene here from
September 5 till the 12th, Js expected
to bring quite as large a number.
Unlike the conclave held here years
ago, this meeting will be attended by
Templars from all over the world.
The Knights of foreign lands are even
now traveling toward the great meet
ing by the western sea. Several parties
have started from different points in
Europe and Asia and the first to leave
England will set out from London to
morrow. This company of eminent
Britons is headed by the Most Eminent

the Earl of P^uston. They will leave
England August 13 and will arrive in
Chicago August 2 4, when the foreign

When the strike leaders were in
formed of the determination of the
packers to refuse to enter into further
conferences with the unionists, j they
began to form plans to. force the hand
of the legal department of the United
States Government in an endeavor to
bring about a settlement. ; This move
ment was decided upon by the legal
advisers of the strikers after they had
received what they considered reliable
information that the 'Attorney General
would not make a move to bring into
operation the perpetual injunction now
held by the Government against com
binations among the packing firms un
less ordered to do so by President
Roosevelt. The plan in effect is this:
To-morrow or next day an action
will be started in the Federal Court in
the name of a striker who holds stock
in one of the biggest of the packing
concerns, demanding that the injunc
tion be put into operation, on the
ground that the illegal combination
still exists and. through it, the share
holders are suffering loss. This, it is
expected by the strike leaders, will in
duce President Roosevelt to take up
the fight and force the packers to pro
duce their books, contracts and agree
ments in open court. Such a step, it is
believed by the strikers, will bring the
packers to terms and end the struggle.
While standing on his doorstep to
night John Schuman, a strike breaker,
was attacked by rioters and severely
kicked and beaten.
"We were courteously received, by a
committee representing the packers
and were informed that considering all
that had passed and present conditions
no good reason existed why any fur
ther conference with the strikers would
be beneficial."
CHICAGO, Aug. 11.â The stock
yards strike to-night seems ho nearer
a settlement than it did the day the
struggle began. The efforts of a com
mittee composed of retail butchers and
grocers to bring about a conference
between the packers and strike lead

tailers' committee was in conference
with Edward Tilden, John Maurer,
Thomas Wilson and Thomas J. Con
ners, representing the packers, for
three hours this afternoon and at the
end of the meeting the following state
ment was given out by the committee
of business men:
By that time the Sheriffs deputies
besan to appear and one shot was fired
from the courthouse. Gravelle then
' van one block eastward, where he tried
to mount a horse that happened to be
hitched there. He was too hotly press
ed, however, and continued down an
alloy and across a lot to Fifth avenue,
<lnw n which he was chased by Raab,
who had joined in the pursuit. Turn
in? down Sixth avenue a moment later
â¢ Gravelle took refuge in the alley beside
Governor Toole's house, from where
' hb emptied his revolver at Raab. Raab
and Deputy Sheriff Spurzcm fired six
j-.hots at Graveile there and the escap
â¢ ing prisoner, wounded, ran into the
basement of the Governor's house,
where he blew out his brains.
The escape took place at 2 o'clock as
Omvelle was about to be led from the
jail to the courtroom in the county
building across the street. Deputy
Sheriff Korizek and Jailor Jones were
iti the ofiiee when the former led Grav
â¢viie out of his cell. Suddenly Gravelle
drew a revolver and pointed it at the
â¢ deputy. The latter made a move
toward his weapon and Gravelle fired
â¢twice at him, both bullets taking effect.
One struck Korizek in the breast a
few inches from his heart. Jones was
'uoi armed and threw up his hands.
/JravelJe ordered the jailor to open the
'door of the jail, which he did. He
;ihen deliberately walked out of the
jail and to the street corner, thirty feet
ii \\ a y.
After an exchange of shots Gravelle
ran into the basement of the Govern
" or's house, where he shot and killed
'himself. He had been wounded by bul
lets from the revolvers of his pur
suers.

JEFFRIES IN SEVERE MOOD.
Writes to a New York Friend as to
His Intentionf Toward Mnuroe.
NEW YORK, Aug. 11. â Writing to
Frank Turner, a lifelong friend, now
resident in New York, Champion Jim
Jeffries says he is going to tear after
llunroe for all there is in him, some
thing he has never done before with
any antagonist.
Jeff says further: "Munroe has talked
so much and made so many mean
cracks that I think he deserves Just
as hard a beating as I can give him.
You know in all my fights I have held
a great deal in reserve. I have never
had to cut loose with a punch with
every ounce behind it because I never
had to go so hard as that.
"I never wanted to be brutal and
my record shows I have never taken
advantage of a weakened man to hurt
him any more than I could help. I
hammered Sharkey harder than any
one else, for Tom was a "glutton for
punishment, but even then I did not
hit as hard is I might have for fear
of possible consequences. I have al
ways had a horror of being mixed up
with a killing in the ring. With Mun
roe I will feel no compunction about
slugging him. He has accused me of
drunkenness, of being chicken-heart
ed and of being physically afflicted.
He has acted in a low down way for
several months and I purpose getting
good and even when we get together
In the ring."

Twin Sullivan was feeling lively
Â¦when he started to warm up with
Munroe, the big miner, yesterday af
ternoon at the Beach Tavern. He com
menced to mix it and became good
and gay. The miner felt just like go
ing some himself and after a clinch in
the last round, he brought over a
choppy little right and down went the
Twin.
He was not out, but he was groggy.
He landed near the roDes and lay
there a few seconds. The bout was
then stopped in a hurry. Munroe did
not use much force in doing the little
trick, all of which goes to show he has
the wallop when he feels like using it.
Before putting Sullivan down, the
miner went a couple of rounds with
Harry Chester, the big Olympian. He
did not land hard on the amateur, but
contented himself with blocking the
latter's leads and Bhooting over an
easy one every once in a while. Andy
Gallagher was not feeling right so he
did not don the mitts.
When Munroe woke up yesterday
morning he complained of a stiffness
in his left arm. Tim McGrath brought
out the electric battery and the arm
was feeling all right when Jack had
finished his day's work. As usual, a
big gathering of sports was there to
watch the proceedings and all were
satisfied with the miner's showing.

TROPHY FOR SCHOOLBOYS AND
OFFICIAL WHO HAS DONE
MUCH FOR PARK TRACK.
Joe Corbett was there again yester
day at Recreation Park to baffle the
renowned Siwashes at every turn. He
had some twisters which were truly a
revelation to the gentlemen from
Seattle. They were swinging their
heads off all day long and then kicking
at the umpire, not out of malice, but
elmply because Joe's bends were so
wide they could not comprehend.
Score. San Francisco 1L Seattle 1.
' Meanwhile Mr. Shields was getting
his. It was a beautiful walloping he
came in for. The best he had was
hammered for fair by the locals Just
as soon as they got their glimmers set
on the right parts of the field. The
parade commenced in the second
round. After that, 'twas the same old
Story cf a bunch of Hank's warriors
rounding third base and coming direct
to the plate.
Corbett started off wildly in the first
inning by walking one man and mak
ing a wild pitch. His erratic streak
v.as checked right there. He steadied
suddenly ar.d was his same old self
once again. Frisk's double to right
Held ar.d a pair cf infield outs netted
a mark for Seattle in the seqond, but
after that the northerners had no li
cense to come near the pan.
Fifteen hits was the sum total for
the day for San Francisco. Every man
on the team, with the exception of An
derson, had one or mc-re nicks in his
bat. To add to this Shields was wild
just when he should have been steady.
He started on the downward course in
the second round by passing Irwin and !
Anderson after Van Buren had singled, j
Y.'har Uncle's stars did then was pain- j
ful to Parke Wilson.
The whole San Francisco team play- I
ed good baseball ar.d the errors were
pot at all costly. Uncle wants every :

VALLEJO, Aug. 11.â The second
day's meet of the harness horses
brought out a larger crowd than the
day before to witness the t^iree events
on the programme. The weather was
Ideal for racing, a light wind blowing
along the stretch.
The first race, for trotters of the 2:16
class for a purse of $500, the Board of
Trade stakes, brought out a field of six
horses. The first heat showed the race
lay between Briney K, the favorite,
and Princess. Each heat was hotly con
tested by these two, Briney K taking
the first heat and Princess the second.
Briney won the next two and the race.
The 2:24 class trot for the Solano
County stakes, with a purse of $1000,
attracted a field of eight starters. The
race was hotly contested, five heats be
ing required. The first heat was won
by H B D, which took the lead from
the start and was never headed. In the
second heat Little Babe led until the
home stretch was reached. Here she
was challenged by Lady Madison,
which won the heat. The third heat
was a repetition of the second, Lady
Madison nosing out Little Babe at the
wire. The fourth heat was won by Mo
rosco, which trotted neck and neck with
H B D to the wire. This was the most
exciting heat of the day. The fifth and
final heat was won by Lady Madison in
2:14 1-3â the best time of the day.
The pony race, in which a good deal
of interest was taken, proved to be
quite easy for Dr. F. T. Bond's Topsy,
which won both heats from Eugene

SARATOGA, Aug. 11.â For the sec
ond time since this meeting began the
purple and gold stripes of John San
ford were In front to-day at "the finish
of two races. The more Important was
the Delaware Handicap, in which Mr.
Sanford's Molly Brant was an odds-on
favorite. While she had no such easy
task as when she defeated Reliable
and Dalesman here a few days ago,
she won with plenty to spare.
For five furlongs Light Brigade set
a fast pace, but soon afterward Molly
Brant showed In front, followed â¢ by
Graziallo, Stalwart and Flying Ship.
The Sanford mare easily came away
in the last furlong and the only real
contest was for second place, with Stal
wart, Graziallo and De Reszke all
heads apart, De Reszke closing strong
ly at the end.
Mr. Sanford won the two-year-old
handicap with Burnt Hills. At one
stage it seemed he would never get
up to the pacemaker. Dandelion, which
had obtained a long lead on the far
turn. After entering the stretch Burnt
Hills cut down the lead of Dandelion,
which began to stop at five and a half
furlongs. Running on like a really
high-class filly, Burnt Hills won easily
from the long shot, Cigar Lighter,
which finished resolutely, while another
good "rater," Merry Lark, came
strongly in the last furlong. The time,
six furlongs in 1:15, marked a good
performance, as the track was "dead."
Africander won the one and an
eighth mile handicap from Palmbearer.

"MR. SHIELDS GETS HIS
School Director Alfred Roncovlerl
will have personal charge of the
school boys' relay race at Ingleside
track on the 21st for the Shreve trophy.
He has volunteered to obtain the en
tries and will give this attractive event
his support in every manner possible.
It is expected that ten teams
from the public schools will try for
the handsome prize that will become
the property of the winning school
without the right of challenge. Great
interest is being taken in the race by
the lads because the affair, of which
this is to be only one feature, is for
the benefit of the Golden Gate Park
amphitheater fund. The field, when
completed, will give a free training
ground for these same lads and will
provide a place where future field
events of the public school league may
be held.
A rousing meeting of the committees
in charge of the sport carnival \vas
held last night in the Palace Hotel
and all details were arranged. Liberal
entries have been made to the handi
cap sprint races. It was announced
that handsome prizes had been donated
for each event. The bicycle races have
also filled well and heats will be nec
essary in the mile novice race. For
the ten-mile team relay all the local
racing clubs will have teams ready to
start and both Oakland and San Jose
have forwarded their entries, with
Stockton, Sacramento and Los Angeles
to be added to the list.
All the money taken at the gate will
go to the park fund, as the work being
done in getting up the pogramme is
gratuitous. The New California Jockey
Club has given free use of the track
and all the officials will donate their
services. Prizes for all events have
been procured in the same manner and
it is hoped to nearly complete the $50,
000 fund at the meeting.
Frank J. O'Kane. the treasurer of the
park fund, has* been indefatigable in
his efforts to raise the fund, which will
add a lasting attraction to the public
playground.

others his children, represented by
Henry Treukamp, have petitioned the
Superior Court to remove him fr'om
his position as administrator of the
estate of his deceased wife, A. E. C.
Bernardina Klumpke, who died No
vember 1. 1902. They allege that the
old man Is feeble and has not looked
after the estate, which more than a
year and a half ago should have been
settled. They say. too, that Charles
Bergeson and Frank Bergeson brought
fraudulent claims against the estate
for $2336 and $1781 respectively,
which Klumpke allowed, and they de
clare that he Is hostile to the heirs
and will make the expense of adminis
tration as heavy as possible. Mrs.
Klumpke left the husband the home

The Columbia Theater manage

production of Bernard Shaw's play,
"Candida." This created a furor in
New York all last season as staged
by Arnold Daly and was for many
weeks played to crowded houses. By
many It is said to be the greatest of
all the remarkable Shaw plays and it
should prove one of the most inter
esting attractions of the season at the
Columbia.* The engagement will be
gin Monday night, August 22, and will
continue for two weeks, after which
Mr. - Daly and his company will leave 1
for New York, where he will again j
appear in the piece. The advance
sale of seats begins next Thursday

OREGON CITY, Aug. 11. â Driven
out of their mountain homes by forest
fires, all kinds of wild animals have
entered Clackamas County towns.
Yesterday Louis Maxon and K.
Kieinsmith killed a full-grown black j
bear in the middle of the Highland j
settlement. A panther was shot and j
killed within 100 yards of the general
store of Highland. A smaller bear was
killed last week by a settler, who j
found the animal roaming about <
within a short distance of his home. j
Farmers' herds in the valley have |
not yet been attacked. The animals !
appear dazed and offer little resist- j
ance when discovered. It is supposed i
that the constant smoke from the for- i
est fires through which they have
passed has rendered them purblind. ;
Special Dispatch to Th* Call
General Frank C- Prescott was re
nominated for the Assembly. It Is wired
that the delegation to the Senatorial
district convention will elect W. T.
Leake of Ontario, a Bard man.
In the Bard camp it is claimed that
this indorsement by San Bernardino
places the Senator ahead of all his com
petitors in Southern California, without
counting San Luis Obispo and Kern as
belonging to the south.
The official count of the votes cast
at the primaries has been completed
up to the Ninety-fourth Precinct of
the Forty-second District. Up to date
no changes have resulted, but In the
tally books of the Forty-seventh Pre
cinct, Thirty-fifth District, a condi
tion was discovered that is hard to
attribute to honest error. One hundred
and five votes that should have been
counted for the local ticket headed by
John Partridge, which was put up In
opposition to the Republican organi
zation, were not tallied. This whole
sale burial of votes did not change re
sults, however, for even this formid
able number of ballots was not suf
ficient to overcome the lead of the op
position ticket. The votes for delÂ£
gates to the State convention contained
or. these ballots were all counted. How
the election officers came to overlook
the local ticket In the matter of theso
ballots is a question they alone can an
swer, especially in view of the signifi
cant fact that on such lapse was dis
covered in regard to the ballots cast
for the local organization ticket.
Nothing has been disclosed In the
official review of the returns to justify
the expectation that the Horses and
Carts will get anything more than a
"look in" when the. Democratic con
vention assembles. Gavin McXab will
have a sufficient number of delegates
to elect the chairman and nominate
the entire ticket. The leaders of the
Democratic organization assert that
proper measures have been taken to
arrest and convict several of the men
Â¦who committed fraud- and perjury on
the day of election.
The time for holding the Demo

Messages were received by wire last
evening to the effect that the San Ber
nardino Republican County Convention
yesterday adopted resolutions strongly
commending Senator Bard's course in
the Senate. After referring to his rec
ord In general the resolutions specified
his position as chairman of the Irriga
tion Committee, which It is declared
"furnishes additional reason why he
should be continued as one of the rep
resentatives of California, in the Senate
at Washington. We therefore believe."
the memorial continues, "he is the
choice of the Republicans of this coun
ty as his own successor."
Further than this the legislative nom
inees were not instructed, but the reso
lutions are understood to bind them as
long as Bard is in the contest with a
show of winning.
Nothing more was heard of the mat
ter until the arrival in Port Town
6*nd yesterday of Miss Leiter. She
called upon the Wrights. He refused
to have anything to do with her and
Mrs. Wright No. 1 helped him to keep
away. jj rs . Wright No. 2 called on
the Prosecuting Attorney, but on learn
ing that she would have to prosecute
Wright for crime if she did anything at
ell. she . told the attorney that she
loved him too much to do anything

away.
It i* said that he has cince made a
trip to Victoria with the original Mrs.

attempt had been made by him to get

he married in Seattle.
' Judge Hatch recognized Wrisrht as

The couple went to a Justice in Seattle

charge of the store in Port Townsend.
Ehe was soon in communication with

Sv*ci*l DUcatch to The Call
It Is hoped that with the co-opera
tion of other libraries, not only may a
new center for scholarship and re
search in the subjects covered by it be
established in the West, but that it
may be possible ultimately to provide
In Chicago such an equipment, cover
ing the legislation, jurisprudence and
customary law of the entire world, as
will render unnecessary a resort to
other centers for the materials of legal
learning and practice.
The working benefits of the Gary col
lection are not to be confined to- the
bar of Chicago, all of whose members
may make unlimited use of it for a
nominal annual fee. Any member of
the bar outside of Chicago, or any
other person desiring- legal advice upcra
foreign law, may write to the law
school of Northwestern University,
Chicago, stating his case or question
of law. The communication will then
be handed for reply to some local legal
adviser, having the privileges of the
library and recommended by the ap
propriate Consul as skilled in the lan
guage concerned, who will consult the
library and return an answer, charg
ing such fee as may be agreed on be
tween himself and the correspondent.
For this service the school will charge
nothing.
It Is also arranged that any member
of the faculty of any other university
may without charge consult the col
lection, or, on proper guarantees, bor
row certain volumes.
"What are the objects to be accom
plished in the establishment of such a
department In a law school library?
One is to suggest ampler courses of in
struction in comparative legislation, to
promote broader legal thinking and to
increase the knowledge of international
law. Another, inasmuch as American
Jurisprudence is rooted in the history
of the Teutonic nations, is to induce
students to investigate thoroughly the
early legal ideas of Germany and Scan
dinavia. Thirdly, and of paramount Im
portance, dairy legal practice will be
continually helped by this collection.
The vast Immigrant population of
the Central "West and Northwest de
mands much aid. In Chicago alone the
foreign born population numbersâ not
including British born and those of
foreign parentage â 152,000. There are
Bc-hemians, 36,000; Dutch, 19,000; Poles,
60,000; Danes. 10,000; Hungarians, 5000;
Germans. 170,000; Italians, 16,000; Rus
sians. 25,000; Norwegians, 22,000;
Swedes, 43,000, and various other na
tionalities, 40,000. Legal questions con
stantly arise concerning inheritance,
marriage, commercial rights, military
service and many other interests upon
which the resident attorney needs to
obtain a thorough understanding of
existing European law without con
sulting a foreign attorney. Time and
expense are thus saved and a more
Intelligent handling of the case be
comes practicable.
COLLECTION FOR ALL.
This collection is of unequaled scope
and value among the libraries of the
country, the only other library equipped
with Continental codes and decisions
being that of the Harvard law school,
which contain decisions of Beven coun
tries. In the Gary collection there are
twenty-one independent countries rep
resented â Austria-Hungary, Belgium,
Bulgaria, Denmark. France, Germany,
Greece, Italy. Luxembourg, Monaco,
Montenegro. Netherlands, Norway, Por
tugal, Roumania, Russia, Servia, Spain,
Sweden. Switzerland and Turkey, being
the entire continent of Europe.
Already the purchases number 6000
volumes. The contents of the collec
tion for each country include the codes,
or systematic legislation, and the stat
utes, all in the original language, with
their translations into other languages,
decisions of the highest courts, leading
law journals and legal and historical
treatises. A preliminary catalogue has
already been printed, to be followed by
one that will be more complete.
Generous aid in the formation of this
unique collection -has been given by
Continental editors, publishers, libra
rians, professors and by the foreign
Consuls in Chicago and their legal ad
visers.
WHAT CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED.
The law school of the Northwestern
University of Evanston, near Chicago,
has within the last year received a re
markable grift. It is known as the Gary
collection of Continental lawa and juris
prudence, and was given to the school
by Judge E. H. Gary, class of 1S67. now
of New York.

In a torpedo boat recently con
structed in England a striking inno
vation has been made in combining
steam turbines -with an ordinary recip
rocating engine, the object being to
secure enconomy at low' speeds, and
high efficlecy when-the maximum speed
Is demanded. In the vessel, which is
of the ordinary design otherwise, there
are three shafts; .to each of -.vhich one
propeller is fitted. The reciprocating
engine, which has an indicated horse
power of 250. drives the center shaft
at a speedy of about 450 revolutions
per minute, a rate sufficient to obtain
a soeed of about ten. knot-* per hour.

Cal. Water in ordinary cases freezes
at the degree of 32 Fahrenheit, or 0
Centigrade or Reaumur, but If kept
perfectly still it may be cooled to
nearly 22 Fahrenheit below freezing,
and still remain liquid. The least
shake, however, or the throwing In of
a solid body makes a portion of it
freeze instantly, and its temperature
rises v immediately to 32. Still water,
if the temperature remained below
freezing for three successive Tveeka,
would probably freeze solid, but thÂ»*
depth to which water freezes depends
upon conditions.
WHEATON, who is an accepted authority on
international law, says that if a prize be a
neutral ship, ho circumstances will justify the
captor in destroying her before condemnation by a prize
court, and if destroyed full compensation must be given
her owner. Moreover, he lays down the rule that in
ability to put a prize crew on the captured neutral ship
does not justify sinking her. since such inahility h the
belligerent's misfortune and in no way affects the rights
of the neutral.
Hall, another modern and very high authority, goes so
far as to say that if for any reason a neutral prize can
not be taken to port for adjudication by a prize court,
she must be released. Lord Stowell, who wrote into in
ternational law the most important of its principles
touching the rights of neutrals, said: "When a ship is
neutral thcact of destruction cannot be justified to the
neutral owner by the grave importance of such an act to
the captor's own state. To the neutral it can be justified
under such circumstances only by a full restitution in
value."-
There is no principle laid down. in international law
that contravenes this. If a neutral be destroyed at sea

to $45 a month, and that of privates $13

DEATH VALLEYâ A Constant Read
er, City. The famous Death Valley of
California is in Inyo County, between
the Panamint Mountains and the
Amargosa Range. It is forty miles
long by about eight broad. In its
deepest part Its bed is 159 feet below
the level of the sea. Its rocky sides
rise fr"om 1300 to 3000 feet above its bed.
THE Landmarks League publicly files a complaint.
The league was organized to acquire and preserve
the ancient landmarks of California, romantically
and practically connected with its history. It had the
sympathy of the Native Sons and Daughters, and of the
Pioneers, and was successful in raising money to buy
old missions and forts and restore and preserve them.
When it got sufficient momentum to be in the public
eye, Mr. Hearst appeared in the midst of it and took
charge of the movement as a means of advertising him
self and his business. He made himself the custodian of
the money collected, and as fast as properties were
bought took the deeds in his own name. The league and
other organizations interested appointed an able Advis
ory Committee to advise Mr. Hearst. Now it appears
that one of the most interesting of the old landmarks,
one of the earliest mission buildings, needs a roof to pre
vent its destruction; and money is needed for the other
purposes of the movement, and- Mr. Hearst refuses to let
it be devoted to the purpose for which it was collected,
although advised by the Advisory Committee that its
use is vitally necessary. Hence the public complaint
that the preservation of the ancient landmarks is at a
standstill, and that property acquiredis going to ruin
for need of money that is on hand for use but can't be
used because Mr. Hearst objects.
The various organizations concerned seem to have
made a mistake. Their Advisory Committee is all right,
but they omitted,to provide that Mr. Hearst should take
its advice. The! committee is" full: of advice, and emits
it like sparks from the fur of a cat. Its advice seems to
the public to be wise and timely. But it does not im
press the party who was to be advised. We can sug
gest no solution to the situation except that the Advis

"Sir John Millais once showed me

it. He said that as he sat painting
one gray afternoon among the reeds
and rushes of the Tay a voice from
behind a hedge asked: 'Man, did ye
ever try photography?' 'No, never,'
said Sir John, and he continued to
paint slowly. 'It's a hantle quicker,'
said the voice.. 'Yes, I suppose so.*
the painter agreed. Then the , voice
said bitlngly: 'An' it's mair like the

speak, of one people, displaying the

long lived and tenacious of life; he

Judge Parker may be said to be a
man free from eccentricities, unless in
tellectual integrity and a sound moral
imagination are to be considered
abnormal in an age of weak demo
goguery. He listens well, patiently
searches for facts, makes up his mind
slowly and aims at general and per
manent rather than particular or tem
porary results. â From "Alton B. Par
ker: A Character Sketch," by James
Creelman, in the American Monthly
Review of Reviews for August.
The Chief Judge of the Court of
Appeals of New York is a man of im
pressive stature and handsome ap
pearance. He is s'x feet tall, weighs
19C pounds and has the proportions
of an athlete, lie was 52 years old on
May 14. He has a large head and the
face of a country-bred gentleman â
strong, fresh colored and unwrinkled.
There is a singular suggestion of
pewer, courage and good nature in
his personality. The eyes are large,
brown and luminous â sincere and di
rt ct. The nose is aquiline, the jaws
large and curved, and the chin round
and massive. The teeth are big and
white, the lower lip heavy and pro
truding and the thick mustache
coarse and tawny. The Judge has a
wide, high forehead. The top head
indicates penetration, energy, benevo
lence, reverence and firmness. The
hair is reddish brown. It is a head
devoid of eccentricity in its lines â
full, even, symmetrical. There Is a
simple unpretending dignity about the
man that fits his massive physique
and easy, upright carriage. He is
sober, sincere, unselfish, decent. Men
in every walk of life turn to him in
stinctively with confidence. There is
neither exaggeration nor self-con
sciousness in his speech or manner. He
does not boast. He has a hearty scorn
for heroics. Firm in spirit, even tem
pered, charitable in his judgments of
others, loyal in friendship, loving work
for its own sake, seeing in law only
the means of justice and order, he
unites the virilities and the sobrieties
in his strong, modest character. He
has, too, a native sense of humor that
will never permit him to become pom

At a children's party at Buckingham

with considerable amusement.
One of the small people present, a
3-year-old son of Lady Lurgan's, has
a passion for soldiers and was show

coated military bandsmen who v.ere
playing in the garden by picking dai

pass by and graciously asked the small
boy to give her a daisy.
The youngster looked her Majesty
over and compared her quiet gown
with the gay uniforms he admired,
then firmly replied:
"No. Grass for you," and handed
the Queen a tiny handful of grass.
The Queen went off laughing at the

show that he preferred bandsmen in

Now, truly, the United States by its recent foreign
policy has demonstrated to the worhl, with sufficient
conviction, that it is not an exponent of war; that in the
interests of peace it is willing to go to all lengths com
patible with its national dignity. Of recent years only
has it been that this nation has risen to the place it now
holds in the respectful estimation of the other great
powers. In questions of acute interest Washington is
now heard with as great a deference as that paid to
Berlin, Paris or London. If Mr. Jarquhar would seek
the reason, let it be apparent by the contrast offered be
tween the status held by our nation fully protected and
our nation utterly unprotected. Let him review the for
eign relations of this country, say in the latter eighties
and early nineties.
When the efficient war fleet of the United States
could be numbered on the fingers of one hand and we
had a smaller standing army than Norway and Sweden,
there occurred the Barrundia incident in the harbor of
San Jose de Guatemala, when the right of asylum under
the American flag was violated by a company of gringo
soldiers. In 1891 we were the recipients of an ulti
matum from Italy, and the European nations looked to
see New York blown out of existence by the ships of
King Humbert. In the same year Chile flaunted us with
the Baltimore incident. The Bering Sea disputes con
tinued to offer Great Britain opportunity for persistent
nagging and backbiting. Yet all of that time our re
sources were as inexhaustible as they arc to-day and
our readiness and alertness, which commend themselves
to the notice of Mr. Farquahar, were certainly in active
operation.
It has been the incorporation of this potential energy
into something tangible, into a navy of power, an army
of efficiency, which has brought the respect of the na
tions to our doors.' A nation armed is in a far better
way of leading: the way to international peace than one
unarmed and open to insult from every bristling gov
ernment. The United States as an exponent of inter-,
national arbitration and disarmament in 1890 would
have been the scorn of Europe. To-day, not because
she should not be armed, but for the very fact that
armed she is. this country may lead the thought of the
world toward a rational international peace programme.
IN an article recently contributed by A. B. Farquhar
to the publication of the Massachusetts Commission
for International Justice, disarmament of the nations
as the absolute prerequisite. of international arbitration is
urged upon the notice of the reader. Declaring .that the
United States is best fitted, both by its potential strength
and the aloofness of its position, to assume the lead in
this movement, the writer endeavors to indicate how a
reduction of our own army and navy would have the
salutary effect of good example. .
"Who could better lead," queries the author, "than a
people whose power is recognized as matchless, whose
resources are inexhaustible, whose readiness and alert
ness are an unfailing defense, making them completely
secure against aggression from without so long as union
and concord continue within?" '
"A small army may continue to be needed," admits
the writer, "to preserve the peace in case of local dis
order; a few war vessels may properly find occasional
use in dealing with the less civilized foreign govern
ments; but for these purposes our demands are not
large and should not be exploited as though they were."
ARMS AND ARBITRATION.
HEADQUARTERS OF THE CALL*
5 HENRIETTA STREET, COVENT
GARDEN. LONDON. July 2S.âAl
though, when Rider Haggard wrote to
the Times the other day about his
queer dream concerning a dog and the
dream's surprising sequel, he said that
he rather expected to be ridiculed
about it, little disposition has been
shown to treat the novelist's narrative
lightly, nor to deride his somewhat
startling suggestion that it tends to
prove that animals survive after death
and may then communicate with hu
man beings. Indeed, the account has
been accepted generally as opening up
an interesting field for scientific inves
tifration which may lead to an entire
reversal of the popular view which
denies a future life to dumb animals.
Briefly this is Mr. Haggard's story.
He went to bed at 12:30 one Saturday
right recently and suffered from what
he took to be a nightmare, from which
he was awakened by his wife.
"As I awoke," he says, "the night
mare itself, which had been long and
vivid, faded from my brain. All I could
remember of it was a sense of awful
oppression and of desperate and terri
fied struggling for life such as the act
of drowning would probably Involve.
"But between the time that I heard
my wife's voice and the time that my
rcmsciousness answered to it, or so it
seemed to me, I had another dream.
"I dreamed that a black retriever
dÂ«'g, a most amiable and intelligent
beast named Bob, which was the prop
erty of my eldest daughter, was lying
nn its side among brushwood, or rough
growth of some kind, by water.
"My own personality in some myste
jitrus way seemed to me to be arising
fiom the body of the dog, which I
knew quite surely to be Bob and no
Â«Â«ther. so much so that my head waÂ»
against its head, which was lifted up
at an unnatural angle.
"In my vision the dog was trying to
speak to me In words and, failing,
transmitted to my mind in an unde
. fined fashion the knowledge that it
v.as dying! Then everything vanished
and I awoke to hear my wife asking
me why on earth I was making those
horrible noises. I replied that I had
had a nightmare about a fearful
struggle and that I had dreamed that
old Bob nas in a dreadful way and
was trying to talk to me and tell me
about it."
Mr. Haggard told other members of
his family of his dream at breakfast
next morning, but it was not until
that Sunday night he discovered the
.dog was missing. Inquiries were set
on foot Monday morning to ascer
tain what had become of him. The
results Mr. Hagpard sets forth at great
length in the form of signed state
ments by various witnesses. They
F.eem to prove conclusively that the
dog, while on an openwork railway
bridge near the house was run over
by a train, either at 10:23 or shortly
after 11 o'clock on the Saturday night
that the dneam occurred and fell from
the bridge to the brink of the water
where the reeds grow.
"Here," continues Mr. Haggard In
his narrative, "if It were still living
and, although the veterinary thinks
that death was practically instantane
ous. Its life may perhaps have lingered
for a few minutes. It must have suffo
cated and sunk, undergoing, I imagine,
much the same sensations as I did In
my dream and in very similar lur
roundlngs to those that I taw thereinâ
namely, among a scrubby growth at
the edsre of the water.
"Both' in a judicial and a private
capacity I have been aocustomed all
my life to the investigation of evi
dence and. If wt may pat aside our
familiar friend 'the long arm of coin
cidence," which in this case would
surely be strained to dislocation, I
confess that that available upon this
matter force* me to the f olio win r con

myself there existed a mutual attach

probable, about three hours after that
event, did succeed in calling my atten

placing whatever portion of my being
is capable of receiving such Impulses
when enchained by sleep into its own
"terrible position. That subsequently
as that chain of sleep was being broken
by the voice of my wife calling me
back to a normal condition of our
human existence with some last de
spairing effort, while that indefinable

dream I seemed to rise from the dog),

of my own tongue, and falling therein,
by some subtle means of communica

ing me that it was dying, for I saw no
blood or wounds which would suggest

"I recogrfized further that if its dis
solution took place at the moment when
I dreamed, this communication must,
have been a form of that telepathy

to represent the most efficient method
of using the steam turbine on a tor

it is thought to be an open question
whether the superiority of the turbina

tests of the arrangement are expected
on the trial of a new French torpedo

An interesting foreigner, poor in everything except
assurance, tried to borrow $100,000 from Reginald Van
derbilt recently and met refusal with "the astounding re

The idea struck the Emperor that If
his royalty was cut off he would de
clare war, which he did in this way:
At the time that General McDow
ell 'was in. command of the division of
California the army headquarters was
on Kearny street, where Emperor
Norton hied himself one morning and,
stationing himself at the entrance, he
patiently waited the arrival of the
general. When the genial command
er was about to enter he received a
sharp command to halt.
Norton had drawn his old crescent
shaped saber and ordered a surrender
there and then. General McDowell
complied and on asking: the terms he
was informed of the rebellious char
acter of the Emperor's subjects and
notified that the strong arm of the
military must be used to enforce obe
dience. The Emperor was invited up
stairs and with a $5 piece a truce -was
declared.
But that was noi the end. For, as
the courteous monarch was about to
depart he spied a pair of gold epau
lets which the general had discarded.
These he demanded and as a matter
of course they were handed to him
by order of McDowell. Displacing
the old faded ones that he had on,
Norton adorned himself with the bet
ter ones, which he wore with pride
until the day of his death. This vic
tory he proclaimed to his subjects
with considerable pride, after which
he duly received his royalty and had
no more trouble with, the government
of Uncle Sam.
It Is not In United States history
that General McDowell surrendered
to a foe. yet it Is bo, and this, too, to
an Emperor. The incident was one
which the general himself loved to tell
when confronted with the story, espe
cially at a banquet where a promiscu
ous gathering of civilians and military
men might be congregated. _'V :
The surrender was to Norton I, Em
peror of all the United States and Pro
tector of Mexico. To the old time
citizens Emperor Norton was one of
the best known men that ever lived In
San Francisco. He was a man of good
education, refined and polite, and for
that matter as courteous as any mon
arch might be. In his earlier career
he was a prominent merchant on
Front street. "Without any known
reason he suddenly became demented
and Imagined himself to be the Em
peror of these United States and pro
tector of the republic of Mexico. La
boring under this hobby he levied a
tax on the downtown merchants,
ranging all the way from 25 cents to
whatever they saw fit to give, but he
never hoarded up any wealth and only
applied when the exigency compelled
him to collect for the bare mainte
nnce of life.
Taking an advantage of his vaga
ries, the merchants conspired to de
cline to contribute to him on his next
visit. This was In the nature of a.
joke to see what he would do when
pinched for money, although every
barroom In the city gave him free
lunches. Yet his spirit was above
"bumming" and money he needed and
must have.
McDowell's Surrender.
"It seems to me," she says, "that a
love like that of a dog â a love tnat is
capable of sacrificeâ must have its re
ward in the achievement of an after
life, possibly in reincarnationâ who
knows? I feel that all life is intercom
municative â that even the trees and
flowers have a life that is, -after all,
"never destroyed, and has its part, like
ours, in the scheme ol the Creator."
W. T. Stead, the editor of the Review
of Reviews, who is an authority on
ghosts and psychic phenomena, says
that he has never heard of an instance
in which an animal, living or dead, has
been able to communicate telepathic
ally with a human being, and puts
forth this theory to account for Sir.
Haggard's experience:
"It seems more probable," he says,
"that while Mr*. Haggard himself was
asleep his subconsciousness â his other
self, which never sleeps â found itself
where the dog lay dying and was able
to impress its physical consciousness
with a sense of suffocation or drowning
in connection with it."
Mrs. Campbell Praed, whose story,
"Nyria," has created such a stir in the
psychical world, accepts Mr. Haggard's
narrative and deductions without any
reservation. She says that even as a
child when wandering among the gum
trees in the Australian bush she was a
firm believer in an after-life for ani
mals, and all she has learned and ob
served since has only strengthened that
view.
"It does seem to suggest." adds Mr.
Haggard in conclusion, "that there is
more Intimate ghostly connection be
tween all members of the animal world,
including man, than has hitherto been
believed, at any rate by Western peo
ples, that they may be, in short, all of
them different manifestations of some
central informing life, though inhabit
ing the universe in such various forms."
tion happened, as I believe, over three
hours previously â what am I to say?
Then it would seem that it must have
been some non-bodily but surviving
part of the life or spirit of the dog
which, so eoon as my deep sleep gave
it an opportunity, reproduced those
things in my mind, as they had al
ready occurred I presume, to advise me
of the manner of its end or to bid me
farewell.
President Roosevelt's action in the enforcement of
existing law stands in plain' contrast to that of Mr.
Cleveland, whose Attorney General, Mr. Olney, decided
that the same laws which President Roosevelt has en
forced were a dead letter and it was useless to bring suits
rnder them. President Roosevelt did not find any fur
ther legislation necessary, but only "the disposition and
courage to enforce existing law," and he had both and
used them, and for that was covertly accused by the
Democratic members of the. Supreme Court of usurpa
tion!
The speech of Judge Parker adds no new element to
the campaign. It is derived from the minority attacks
made in the House, and as a whole is marked by great
care not to tread upon the toes of the friendly interests
represented by Messrs. Belmont, Lamont and J. J. Hill.
The party misses in it the vigorous statement in which
Mr. Cleveland asserted himself and achieved his leader
ship. Judge Parker leaves upon the country the im
pression that he is some other man's man, while Cleve
land left no room in the focus for any personality but his
own.
As to the Philippines, there is no discernible difference
between Judge Parker and the Republican platform. He
admits that the islands came to us by the accident of
war, that we* cannot at present avoid their administration
and that we must eventually permit to them self-govern
ment. As that is the purpose of the present probation
ary period, there is nothing upon which to hang an
issue.
The speech leaves the country not expectant of what
Judge Parker may further do or say, but curious as to
the subsequent proceedings of the man who runs him.
It would have been more dignified and direct in Judge
Parker had he indulged in a bill of particulars, giving
specific instances of unconstitutional usurpation, and
backing the charge with proof. From this, however, he
carefully refrains, preferring to indulge in very general
ities, and to draw visions of the consequences of consti
tutional disobedience on the part of the President. The
country is familiar with these general charges. The De
mocracy has made them against every Republican Pres
ident, including Lincoln. In his case he was savagely
and persistently attacked for destroying the constitution,
because he was trying to preserve it as the organic law
of an undivided Union. The same style of attack has
befcn adopted against all of his successors. Now, if the
charge be true as against President Roosevelt, the mi
nority of the last Congress should have reported to the
House a resolution for his impeachment.
The constitution provides a way to test the conduct
of a President in respect to his official limitations. Why
was that way not acted upon by the minority? In de
fault of specifications, and, in the absence of the authori
tative test by impeachment, provided by the constitu
tion itself, the country is warranted in assuming that the
accusation is partisan and false, used to impress the
sensibilities and affect the votes of the people, who arc
intelligently sensitive to the maintenance of their or
ganic law and observance^of its wise distribution of the
powers of government. While considering this matter,
it is not forgotten that Democratic leaders made exactly
the same charge against Mr. Cleveland, who was alleged
by his own party to be a usurper and a tyrannical dic
tator.
Impinged upon this part of his speech is Judge Par
ker's rather fervid denunciation of a second term in the
Presidency. It reads like a criticism of Mr. Cleveland,
who was three times a candidate and twice elected, and
who was undoubtedly the choice of a large clement for
a fourth nomination and a third term in the Presidency.
The reader of the speech is impressed with its gingerly
treatment of issues that have been declared by the party
to be burning questions. He puts the tariff foremost as
the cause of trusts and suggests that tariff tinkering is
the proper remedyi He affirms that against their ag
gressions there is a common law remedy of which any
citizen can avail himself. Upon this point he says:
"What is needed in addition to the -passage of a statute
revising the tariff duties to a reasonable basis is not so
much other and different laws as officials having the
disposition and courage to enforce existing laws."
We have to suggest to the Judge that on that point
he inquire of his political friend and supporter, the Hon.
Dan Lamont. vice president of the Northern Pacific and
associate of Hill and Morgan in the formation of the
railroad/trust. Mr. Lamont can inform him that he and
his associates in that gigantic trust complain of too
much disposition and courage on the part of President
Roosevelt in the enforcement of existing law. If he will
read the opinions of the Democratic Justices of the Su
preme Court of the United States, dissenting from the
court in that case, he will find that they strongly insinu
ate that President Roosevelt's course in enforcing ex
isting law was one of his alleged violations of the con
stitution. In like manner, if the Judge will consult Mr.
Eelmont and others of his supporters, he will find that
in their opinion the President was a usurper for order
ing and winning the other six great suits against the
trusts that have been won by the Government during his
administration.
THE committee has notified Judge Parker that he is
a candidate for the Presidency. The information
was conveyed in a speech by Champ Clark, who in
dulged in much unction and in some prophecy. The im
portant part of the ceremony was Judge Parker's speech
in reply. It was carefully prepared and read from man
uscript. Its keynote is the charge that the constitution
is being violated by the Executive. Thi/5 appears in
every part of the speech as the prevailing theme. The
cue for this is taken from the cry of the party in'Con
gress and in its press. _
by a belligerent, no .matter what the character of her
cargo or any part of it. the belligerent assumes at once
the responsibility of full restitution, and this responsibil
ity is not voidable by a subsequent decision that there
was contraband in the cargo, made by a prize court of
the belligerent.
Great Britain has a complete case against Russia for
sinking the Knight Commander, and so has Germany for
the Thca. They may enforce it or not Their failure to
do so will not change the law of the sea for other neu
trals. The nations must finally establish and enforce the
rule that the. high seas are free* and that belligerents
must proclaim and sustain an actual and effective block
ade, and seize only such neutrals as approach the block
aded coast with the obvious purpose of running the
blockade.

I Shipping men are wondering what the Brit
ish ship Brodlck Castle, which was supplied
wljth provisions by the navy transport Solace,
was doing nearly 1200 miles to the westward
of Honolulu. She was bound from Iqulque for
the Hawaiian port. Insurance men are won
dering why there was only one chronometer on
board, and sailormen declare that even with
out a chronometer the skipper of the windjam
mer should not have strayed 1200 miles oft his
course. According to the cablegram received
from Honolulu, the Brodlck Castle, short of
provisions and with her chronometer broken,
was spoken and relieved by the Solace in 20:38
north, 178:35 west. The officers of the Solace
also told the skipper of the Brodick Castle ex
actly where he was.

provides that all promotions from pa
trolman to corporal be made from the

provides for an increase in the pay of
lieutenants from $140 to $160. The
fifth amendment provides for the ap
pointment of an inspector of police,

The Spring Valley "Water Company
3 r esterday filed an answer to the suit
be.gun..lAsÂ£ March by Emma, XT. Mer
ritt, as executrix of the estate of
Adolph Sutro. to prevent the company
from running flumes from Lake Honda
over lands belonging to the Sutro
estate, between the coursing park and j
Corbett avenue. After alleging that
the water company had begun the
construction of a flume over the prop
erty without right, Mrs. Merritt al
leged that the Sutro estate had been
damaged In the sum of $3000.
The Spring Valley Company answers
that its right of way was granted over
the lands by F. L. A. Pioche, Lev! Par
eons and 'John B. Felton In 1861 be
fore the property was transferred by
them to Sutro. It says, too, that the j
flumes have been maintained by the
company along the line in question for '
thirty years and the construction com
plained of was merely in the way of i
rebuilding the waterway. After such !
a long possession it Is pleaded that the
action is barred by statute of limita
tions, and furthermore it is asserted
that the flume is a public utility in
that a third of the inhabitants of San
Francisco receive their water supply
from the Lake Honda reservoir.

The whaling schooner Monterey,
smallest of the blubber-hunters, is
meeting with success in the northern
waters, and if Captain Foley harpoons
not another whale between now and
the end of the cruise, he still will be
a goodly pile of dollars ahead of his
venture.
Word was received yesterday ' from
Dutch Harbor that the Monterey waa
there and that she had taken four big
whales. The Monterey r eached the
Alaska port July 24 and .three days
later Was to leave for a hunt in the
Arctic before bringing her bone and
blubber to market.
The Monterey was the first of the
whalers to use a gasoline engine as
auxiliary motive power. Whalemen
shook their heads and declared that
Captain Foley was making a sad mis
take. The "choo-chooing" of a gaso
line engine's exhaust, they declared,
would stampede the most conservative
whale that ever chewed up a boat or
assimilated the # bombs, harpoons and
other deadly weapons and hardware
with which whalemen sometimes fail
to kill their monster quarry.
If the Monterey's exhaust did make
a noise, Captain Foley did not follow
its example. He said nothing, but went
ahead installing the engine. The ma
chinery behaved badly on last year'3
cruise, which was the first cruise of
the gasoline engine. In spite of break
downs, however, Foley satisfied him
self that there was nothing the matter
with his idea, and before starting 'on
his present voyage he equipped the
Monterey with a new engine.
The little schooner Abbie F. Morris,
from Seattle, for whose safety some
anxiety was felt, arrived at Dutch Har
bor July 26. The revenue cutters Thetis
and Perry were also there on July 24.
the early morning tides are given in the left

a series of poker games, at which he
and Schmitt were interested player.".
Hirschman besides pleading the stat

Schmitt could not recover because the
loan was in reality a gambling debt

law.

The Board of Education yesterday
took the Board of Supervisors to task
for having neglected to make provision
for lighting, the public schools, an
omission which resulted, says President
Roncovieri, in the charges therefor be
ing increased during the present fiscal
year. Director Boyle stated that he
had withheld payment of two bills of
the San Francisco Gas Company be
cause the Drice had been raised from
2.9 cents to 7 cents for arc lights and
from 43 cents to $1 per 1000 feet for gas.
The board also held up the bills of
certain lumber dealers who charged for
cartage of lumber furnished, whereas
the specifications provide that cartage
shall be included in the bid. .
Resolutions appointing Pedro Espina
supervisor of penmanship and Miss L-
E. Freese assistant supervisor of pen
manship were postponed for one week
to give Superintendent Langdon an op
portunity to be consulted on the mat
ter.
California enthusiasm and hos
pitality will mark the tour through
â¢the and San Joaquin val
'l^ys of the board of engineers re- j
tained to grapple with the problem of
t*he floods that yearly inundate- these I
districts. In order that the cities and
â¢ towns at which the board will stop on
.its tour may have time to prepare re
ceptions and gather facts and figures
tt> present to the board, the start from
. this city has been delayed until next
Monday evening and the following

Owing to the fact thru Major Dab
r><-y of the board of engineers whs in
riisposed. no meeting of the commis
sion was held yesterday morning.
William H. Hall, who is interested in
property in the Sacramento Valley, ap
.7>*\ired to make a statement. He was
r^QUfsted to return this morning, when
he will be heard.
Herman Schussler, ch!?f engineer of
the Spring Valley Wtter Works, again i
occupied the stand yesterday in the !
proceedings brought against the city to '
have the water rate fixed by the Super- |
visors set aside. The hearing promises I
to occupy a great length of time, as ex- j
perts will testify on both Fides. Com- j
missioner Heacock is merely taking the j
testimony, and no time is wasted in)
arguments over disputed points of law.
Schussler's testimony yesterday was i
a continuation of that of Tuesday, con- i
sisting chiefly of a description of the
water works, their capacity and the
presentation of maps showing the av
erage rainfall during the last fifteen j
years, the amount caught in the reser- |
voirs and the wastage by overflows and
evaporation. Attorney Partridge for
the city objected to the introduction of
this map, also to a great deal of Schuss
ler's testimony.
Upon questioning by Attorney Kel
logg for the company the witness gave
his opinion regarding the establishment j
of a water system to be supplied by j
the rivers and mountain streams, such j
as has been suggested for a municipal ,
plant. "Owing to the vagaries of the j
climate," he said, "it makes ho differ
ence who supplies the water to the city
or from what source it is drawn; a
largre storage reservoir is an absolute
necessity. The rivers all have their
hiph and low seasons, the low season
usually being about the end of sum- j
mer. For this reason the natural flow j
of the rivers cannot be relied upon. |
The Sierra Xevadas have few lakes or j
natural reservoirs, and the slope is so j
great that unless artificial catch-basins
are provided the water rapidly runs off
and is lost."
The witness then referred to the plans
for increasing the resources of the
Spring Valley Company, among these
being the enlargement of the Alameda
Creek system. If these plans are car
ried out, he said, the resources on the I
peninsula, plus the Alameda Creek sys- '
tern, will yield 110,000,000 gallons a day, j
which, according to careful calcula- ,
tlons, will be sufficient to supply the j
wants of the city fifty years hence. ]
Very little water has been wasted by !
the company in the last fifteen years, j
During one very rainy season there was ;
a big loss owing to an overflow of the i
then uncompleted Crystal Springs dam. j
No water has been lost from the Pilar
citas Creek system except by evapora
tion.
The hearing will be continued to-day.

. Deputy Sheriff Frank Bartlett of
San Mateo County last 'evening arrest
ed John D. Tomkins In San Mateo as
he was taking the train for San Fran
cisco. Tomkins had passed a bill that
had been raised from $1 to $10. He
has been leisurely journeying from
different points in the State toward
this city, passing his bills all along
the line. He was shadowed by H. M.
Moffitt and Thomas B. Foster, secret
service agents.
These officers were in the vicinity
watching Tomkins when Bartlett
pounced on the man. Bartlett was on
the point of arresting the secret ser
vice men, who were strangers to him.
and whom he thought to be confed
erates* of Tomkins until they declared
themselves.
When the prisoner was brought to
this city he was readily recognized by
Chief Hazen of the secret service. It
was not the intention of the service to
arrest Tomkin.s at present, but let him
run loose till his partners were found
and arrested.
Tomkins is an artist in his work
and his bill raising is nearly perfect.
The engraved figures "10" are cut
from some old imitation or Confed
erate notes and carefully panted over
the figures on a $1 bill. The other
telltale figures and devices are daubed
over with green ink and the whole is
eo skillfully done that it is an easy
matter to deceive with them. "Jack"
Tomkins, as he is known, did a good
business in Alameda, Stockton and
Sacramento and the secret service
men have many of his bills. He de
clares he did not know they had been
raised. He is 35 years old, an elec
trician and telegraph operator, and
has been identified with crooked work
in this city. for about two years.

PERSONAIi.
PHILADELPHIA. Aug. 11. â^ Joe
Goddard, the "Barrier champion." has
not been allowed to rest in his grave.
His remains now lie in the pickling
vat of a Philadelphia Medical Col-
Such was the rumor that agitated
the sporting fraternity to-night. Pos
itive information reached Ben For
rest, a Merchantville. N. J.. saloon
keeper, who was Goddard's warm
friend in his declining hours, that the
body had been seen in the vat within
the last twenty-four hours. /
Goddard was a man of almost per
fect physique. He was able to live
for months with a bullet hole in his
brain at a point which would have
meant almost instant death to an or
dinary mortal. These things would
have made Goddard a particularly
interesting subject for a dissecting
table.
Friends of the Former "Barrier
Champion" Make a Grewsome
Discovery in Philadelphia.

NEW TORK. Aug. 11. â There was a period
of great strength and animation in the stock
market to-day, while the first interpretation of
the Government crop report was the\ dominant
inf.uence In the market. -The confidence with
which the buying of stocks was conducted was
materially Impaired later in the day. The wild
upshoot of prices in the wheat market was a
serious unsettlement to the optimistic views
deduced from the reading of the Government
crop report. The strength of the corn market
also caused grave misgiving over the seeming
promiiÂ«e of a record crop of that cereal hf-ld
out by the Government crop report. But be
sides these influences it must be borne tn mind
that an enormous amount of profit- taking was
accomplished during the active and rising mar
ket for the morning. This had the effect of
.distributing stocks from stronger to weaker
hands and of diminishing the motive for sup
porting the market by tbe powerful speculative
operators who had been reducing their hold
ings. The reactionary tendency of the Metro
politan Tractions because of selling to take
profits on yesterday's violent rise was a drag
on the general market. An attempt was made
to remedy this by forcing Metropolitan Securi
ties to a higher level. But the stock failed to
hold and the movement was most effective In
curing the skepticism which had developed
In the prevailing sentiment. The disturbance
aroused in the steel trade by the discussion
over the steel billet cut has developed a suspi
cion that the conditions In that trade art not
as tranquil as have been reported In the main
tenance of agreements for sustaining prices.
United States Steel preferred showed a very
slight response to the strength of "the market
a u . la iÂ£ drcp he 'ped much to unsettle thÂ«
market. Tht? engagement of gold for ship
ment to London had rather less than Its usual
sentimental Influence against the market, as
the week s receipts of gold here on account of
Japanese and Australian arrivals at San Fran
cisco have been liberal, and the morning's ca
bles reported another shipment of $1.750 000
during the morning had every appearance of
important buying, and it was taken for granted
"Â»V large commitments were being made that
had waited on the Government 1 * report of the
August 1 ccndlUon of the crops before making
a determination. It was held that the corn
prospects therein Indicated were brilliant and
that tho reported damage to spring wheat
had been much exaggerated. The movement
In Southern Pacific and Union Pacific and the
character of tbe buying In them wens esDe
dally imposing. But the grain and cotton
carriers enjoyed a good demand for all sec
tions of the crop region. Northwestern made
a special response" to the favorable annual re
port. The rise of a point In Reading was not
very effective In helping tbe other coalers and
trunk lines, and the industrials, which were
conspicuous yesterday, fell .Into the back
ground. After the grain markets had closed
for the day It. was found feasible to rally tbe
stock market, IÂ«d by Southern Pacific, which

CHICAGO. Aug. 11.â Wheat prices broke
the record for the present crop to-day by an |
; upward whirl of 4 Vic to '494c a bushel. The |
motive was the Government report, . which, j
without taking Into account rust damage with
in the last ten days, estimated the yield of j
winter and spring wheat at 47,000,000 bushels 1
less than promised a month ago. At the j
close September, as compared with yesterday's
final figures, showed a net gain of 2%c. .Corn |
Is up 7 ic Oats are %c higher. Provisions J
closed 2Vjc higher to 2Cc lower. i
The wheat market, keyed up to the highest !
pitch of nervousness, seemed to need only the I
official declaration of the deficit Indicated by!
the Government report as a cause for a paroxysm
Of bullishness. Quantities of long wheat
thrown on the market at the. start by un
suspecting longs with profits produced a mo
mentary easier tone and a loss In the opening ;
figures. Further than that the effect of Â»uch
celling was practically nil. September values
suffered lc to Uic under the opening pressure,
the first trades being at. 99?4c to $1. The
stimulus of the Government report became at
once apparent, although the culmination of Its i
Influence aid not come until the last hour j
Of trading. Successive Valns In the price of ;
September were recorded with the demand
becoming more and more general as offerings
became lighter. When the $1 02 mark had
been passed the desire to possess wheat seemed i
to feeize upon all alike. Individuals who had \
been inclined to bearishneas became frantic
bulls, while others who had sold short ap
peared to have become nearly panic-stricken.
Almost a sheer Jump to $l'04ft was the re- j
suit. Fortunate holders of long lines were j
tempted by the high prices and their sales
checked the adva'nee and brought about a
partial reaction. September receded to $1 03%,
but eloped strong at $1 03%. .
Corn for September delivery opened at a loss I
of %(fftc at 53e53ftc. September later sold j
up to 54%c on the wheat bulge, declining to
&4%c, the closing figure.
Oats opened lower, but the close was firm
at 34%c, a lose of ftc from the top.
Heavy receipts of hogs had a depressing ef
! feet. September pork at the close was down

The Chicago letter of R. Brent Mitchell says:
"The Government report is fully as good as
expected and caused a little easier opening.
The confirmation of the previous rumor that
Austria-Hungary has prohibited exports of
corn and barley Is considered a very bullish
Incident and contributed greatly to the
strength. Temperatures are a little lower.
Country offerings are little larger than yester
day. Induced probably by the advance In price.
There la. however, a pretty good cash demand
and the demand seems equal to the supply.
The Price Current speaka of a less confident
view of the corn crop because of the dry
weather. It Is a broad and active market and
its general tone and actions are strong."

CASH WHEAT.
This market continued quiet and easy as to
the cash grain, but futures were higher tn
sympathy with Chicago. Trading was rather
better than on the preceding day, but was not
active.
Chicago ran up 3Uc to $1 04^i,but fell back
a little at the close. Â¦Â¦
E. F. Hutton & Co.'s Chicago wire3 said:
"The advance was i caused by further crop
damage reports. The sentiment, however,
seems to be changing a little. Northwest ad
vices, while still bad. are more conservative
and the tendency now Is to modify the esti
mates of damage. The cash situation Is:
Large receipts and a poor demand. The pit
crowd are buying on Snow's bullish crop re
port. The' Cincinnati Price Current saya that
conditions hare not Improved, but gives a crop
of 600.000.000 bushels. The Michigan State re
port gives a crop of 5.500,000 bushels, against
15,500,000 last year. Minneapolis wired at the
close: "Looks like rain for the Northwest this
afternoon and to-morrow. This will fix the
crop/ "
The letter of R. Brent Mitchell said: "Mar
ket opened rather sharply down on the Gov
ernment report but soon turned strong and
advanced rapidly. It was on the same in
fluences as heretofore. The Northwest con
tinues to send crop damage report*. A great
many conservatives In touch with the condi
tions In the Northwest are of the opinion thai
the damage Is being overestimated, but from
the nature of the cause of the damage It is
pretty hard to have a satisfactory opinion as
to- Its extent at this stage. Market Is ex
tremely nervous and with "the light stocks ad
vances readily' on a moderate volume of buy-
Ing. Cash situation Is perhaps a little better.
Foreign markets do not follow our advance
and to-day's closing prices are higher than in
Liverpool. The whole situation is unusual and
we think Invites very conservative advice and
action." -

The question of Mrs. Walls' holdings
of .valuable stock and dividends was
later sumbitted to Eugene W. Levy as
referee and It was brought out that
when the Walls t^re married in 1896
the wife had about ?1000.. About five
years ago she was presented with 51$
shares in the Grain and Stock Exchange
Company, of which her husband was
head clerk. The gift was made by W.
E. Baines, president of the company.
Mrs. Walls declined to answer the
questions of Attorney Tauszky before
the referee.. Baines was equally reti
cent, but admitted that he had Riven
the stock to Mrs. Walls at a downtown
restaurant in the presence of her hus
band.
It appeared in the examination that
Mrs. Walls had taken the stock out ot
a safe deposit box and taken it home.
In her testimony before the referee the
iady said that she clothed herself and
bought her own Jewelry out of the divi
dends received, usually giving her hus
band the money with which to make
the purchases.
When Otis commenced his suit Walls
answered that he would not pay the
claim because it represented a gam
bling debt in connection with transac
tions on the Pacific Stock Exchange.
The. pleading failed to -find sympathy
with the jury.
The efforts of John A. Walls, broker,
to resist payment to Stephen Otis, a
broker, of a judgment for $1*507 50, prom
ises to make an Interesting story be
fore,the litigation is ended. Otis sued
Walls for money said to be due and got
a jury verdict in the Superior^ Court
Walls had no assets subject to judg
ment, and Otis attempted to collect
from money In bank in the name of
Mrs. Walls. Yesterday Judge Carroll
Cook gave Otis permission to sue Mrs.
Walls for the amount and issued an
order restraining the disposition of 518
shares of stock in the Central Grain
and Stock Exchange owned by Mrs.
Walls. She has received $41,000 in divi
dends on the stock and has the money
on deposit in various banks.
Very little cash was found in Bies
fpH'f room. Among his 'possessions was
a document making him agent for the
Jackson Typewriter Company of New
York. Numerous letters from his
father and two cousins, Charles and
L. B. Bissell, tobacco dealers of Suf-
Eugene V. N. Bissell, a retired army
officer, was found dead in his apart
ments at the Grand Hotel yesterday.
The fact that his room was filled with
gas, escaping from two wide-open Jets,
indicates that' Bissell committed sui
cide, though he left no statement to
thet effect.
Grief over the loss of his beautiful
wife, who died svaddenly last spring at
Chicago. Is believed to have driven the
former soldier to end his life. A little
packet containing a tress of dark
brown hair, found near the body bears
out this belief. It bore this writing:
"A lock of my beloved wife's hair. She
died April IS. 1904." Beside th>e packet
lay a phrÂ»iograpli of the dead woman.
Tho life of .Eugene Bissell was full
of cction. Until 1SSS he was In busi
ness with his " father, Eugene Bissell
Sr.. a .' commission merchant of New
York. .In that y*?ar' he. was appointed
captain in the Forty- fÂ«urth Volun
teers and went with his regiment to
the Philippines, lit was later trans
ferred to the Second Cavalry and made
e second lieutenant of regulars. He
obtained his discharge in 1901 and went
to China. Early in 1902 he came to
Ban" Francisco and married Miss Sara
â¢Elinor Hudson of Cariia<5a_
The -svedding -otsls the outcome of a
prettjiSsomance. He met Miss Hudson
shortly before he became a soldier.
She was then taudyaig at a convent
in Ottawa. Miss Hudson, a pretty girl
in her teens, dropped a bool^ Bissell
ricked it up for h*r and from that
Incident a friend^ilp w.as formed that
ripened into love. The most touching
letter in the dead man's effects was a
little scrawl from M^ss Hudson re
minding him of the Incident and speak
ing of the happiness it "would bring
both. The happiness was short-lived.
Mrs. Bissell died suddenly on April 18.
From that time Bissell seems to have
lost any real desire for Hfe. Provided
with letters from influential frlnds, he
came to San Francisco ostensibly to
enter Into business here ajid to try to
forget his gTPat loss, but this was evi
dently impossible. Thowgh only 34
years of age, he seems to have lost
ambition. From his correspondence it
was learned that he tried to obtain
a commission in the ChiDese army. He
probably believed that he might be able
to forget his sorrow in the rush and
excitement of active service. But his
efforts were unsuccessful. Attempts to
secure profitable employment here were
also fruitless.
After passing this last milestone In
her career Mrs. Layman has been liv
ing quietly in Los Angeles, biding her
time for bringing the suit just institut
ed. She charges desertion on the part
of her husband, which it is believed
she will have no difficulty in proving.
Mrs. Layman Is an attractive wom
an of the bloude type and has at dif
ferent times evinced a strong taste
for literary work.
Mrs. Layman is the daughter of the
late Millionaire SneU of Chicago. Snell's
mysterious murder in his Washington
boulevard mansion in Chicago twelve
years ago is yet to be solved by the
police of that city, who have long been
searching for William Tascott, a man
supposed to have been implicated in
the crime. For years after the death
[ of her father, the millionaire's rela
tives were engaged in a bitter litiga
tion over his estate,- and the final dis
tribution is yet to-be made.
Scarcely had the girl reached her
majority when she entered upon a
series of unhappy matrimonial entagle*
ments. She was first â¢ married to a
young man named Coffin, but their
love soon cooled and a decree of di
vorce in favor of the young wife paved
the way for her marriage to Henry
Walker,- a man of considerable promi
nence in Waukesha, Wis. They soon
quarreled and again the wife went to
court, where the bonds of wedlock
were severed.
| A few months later the friends of
: Mrs. Walker were surprised to learn
| that she had remarried Coffin, but they
i Avert slowly recovering from their sur
: prise when t the news came that Mr. and
Mrs. Coffin' had a second time been le
gally separated. Later Ehe married
again, but once more the union was
disturbed by divorce proceedings, and
soon after effecting her freedom Mrs.
Grace Snell - Coffln-Walker-Coffln-etc.
had packed her trunks and' started for
California.
Establishing herself in a cozy cottage
in Pasadena two years ago the still at
tractive and interesting divorcee fre
quently found pleasure in journeying
to Los Angeles, where she first met
Perkins Layman, then a popular clerk
behind the Van Nuys desk. A short
acquaintance resulted In a quiet wed
ding and friends of the young man be
sieged him with congratulations for his
successful "catch." But Layman's fate
was destined to be not different from
that of his predecessors in the affec
tions of the young. Eastern grass
widow. It quickly became known that
husband and wife were at outs and !
this report was one morning confirmed
by the news that Layman had disap
peared.
LAY3IAX SOOX TIRES OF WIFE.
Layman was easily traced to San
Diego and unhesitatingly confided to I
his more Intimate friends that he had I
done with married life.
Mrs. Layman came to San Francisco
several days ago in company with Mr.
and Mrs. H. J. Woollacott of Los An
geles and announced that she would
accompany them on a visit to Lake
Tahoe. Hardly had she arrived here,
however, when she placed herself in
communication with attorneys. They
prepared a complaint for divorce,
which was hurriedly dispatched to the
south to be filed. Desertion is charged
against Layman.
DAUGHTER OF MILLIONAIRE.

Francis Hotel for several days, busily
preparing to separate herself from her
latest husband. It transpired yester
day that she filed a suit in Los
Angeles against, Perkins Layman, for

whom .she was married a little over
a year ago. This, is the fifth time Mrs.

Monday afternoon and early Tuesday
morning he was greatly startled by
the Information that cash bail of $5

free to go at large. Never before had
he been released pending trial and he

clarified the situation. He worked so
valiantly all that day at the polls that
on the following day he was too tired
to go to court. Yesterday morning,
however, he stood before Judge Fritz,
who punished his tardiness by send
ing him to jail for twenty-four hours.
"I'll waive everything and . plead

John Connors went to visit John Ry

cock street, one evening about a month
ago and made his presence so objec
tionable to Mr.. Ryan that he was or
dered by that gentleman to leave "the
house and never again darken its
portals.
"Ha! ha!" laughed John Connors, de
fiantly; "I'd like to see you or a dozen
like you attempt to put me out."
Mr. Ryan s forthwith obtained police
aid, but when he returned with two
officers he discovered that during his
absence Mr. Connors had. firmly fas
tened the door by nailing it to its
frame, also to the floor. The united
strength of v the sturdy trio -was re
quired to burst the fastenings. And
after entry was obtained Mr. Connors
proved himself a formidable opponent
against heavy odds.
That's how the story was told '"by" tha
prosecution yesterday to Judge Con-
Ian, who continued the hearing till
next Saturday.
Manuel B. Gonzales and his wife,
both colored, occupy one-half of the
house numbered 1218 Point Lobos ave
nue, the other half being the residence
of Mr. and Mrs. John Collins, who are
of pure Anglo-Saxon blood. Mr. Gonza
les, who is a barber, missed from his
belongings one "Montague bang," to
which he attached great pecuniary
value, on account of its wonderful nat
uralness of shade, and he accused-Mrs.
Collins of having purloined it to en
rich her coiffure. , To the accusation,
Mrs. Collins, baptized, Mollie, retorted
by calling Mr. Gonzales a double
adjectived."nigger," and supplemented
the epithet with an insinuation that he
was not strictly faithful to his marital
vows, but had .a penchant for white
women. . Then, as reported to Judge
Cabaniss, Mr. Gonzales assaulted Mrs.
Collins, for which she had him arrested
on the charge of battery.
-After hearing both sides of the case
his Honor continued it until September
12, and hoped that when the parties
again appear before him the "Monta
gue bang," primal cause of the con
tention, might again be in the" custody
of Mr. Gonzales. .--, \ -',Â¦. Â¦'.-.' ~2.<

Judge Fritz decided that his court

case of Leila Estella Wllley, a nurse
at the United States Marine Hospital,
who is charged with manslaughter. By
accidentally giving a patient, Franz
Johnson, a poisonous compound instead
of a medicine prescribed for him, she

pott, "and as I felt tired and thirsty
after a hard day's toiling and moiling
and thought that a little beer would
do .me lots of good, I took the can
along with me. When he came up to
me I says,. 'Papa, I want you to give
me a little change and get
me a little beer; and be sure,
papa, that you hurry, for I'm
going to' waik homeward slowly-*
we live at 523 Twenty-sixth avenueâ
so you can catch up with me.' Papa
took the can and I started to saunter
along when three men Jumped out
from a fence or somewhere and began
to ask me all sorts of questions. Well,
maybe you don't think I was scared.
When they asked who papa was and
what he went to Callahan's for I
thought I'd faint, for how was I to
know that they did not wjmt.papa for
some awful deed? So when papa came
along I told him to go at once and
see what the men wanted and papa
gave me the can and went and talked
to them like a perfect gentleman. Then
one of them, the biggest one, choked
papa and pulled out a club and all that
papa did was to ask him to show his
star." ' . -
Much more was Mrs. Philpott ready
and willing to tell but the court un
gallantly held her down to a bare nar
ration of the facts that came within
her actual observation. Mr. Philpott
denied that he attacked Policeman
Fairweather, or even addressed him
"sassily" and the policeman swore pos
itively that Mr. Philpott did both those
things. Then, after an attorney for
the defense had argued eloquently and
at length on the subject of an Ameri
can citizen's right to "rush the growl
er" freely and untrammeled, the Judge
dismissed the case.
The charges against Mrs. Callahan
will be heard before a jury.
Mrs. Ellen Callahan's barroom,"at
i tached to her grocery at Clement street
and Twenty-sixth avenue, seems to be
r'a source of trouble for th*at neighbor
hood. It was the cause of Mrs. Calla
han's arrest on two distinct ! charges â
selling liquor without a license and
keeping a disorderly houseâ and' it alBO
indirectly led to the placing of F. T.
Philpott, a carman, before Police
Judge CabaniEs yesterday on a charge
of assaulting Patrolman Fairweather.
Three police officers in plain . attire,
of whom Fairweather was one, had
Mrs. Callahan's saloon under espionage
one evening last week, their object be
ing to obtain evidence sufficient to as
sure her conviction on either or both
of the charges above mentioned, when
they saw a woman meet a man and
hand to him a tin pall of the conven
tional "growler" pattern, with which
vessel the man went to '. Callahan's.
Then the human sleuths Interrogated
the woman, who proved to be Mrs.
Jane Philpott, wife of F. T., and who
told them a much longer story than
she was permitted to repeat yesterday
for the enlightenment of his Honor
Cabaniss. Indeed, the court experi
enced much difficulty in restraining
Mrs. Philpott from launching into an
autobiography beginning with her
marriage to Mr. Philpott twenty-three
years ago and concluding with that
