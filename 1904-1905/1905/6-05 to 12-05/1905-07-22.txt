SAN DIEGO, July 21.^â Broken and blackened, with her flag
flying at half-mast and her hold filled with fifteen feet of water,
the United States gunboat .Bennington lies" beached; upon -the
shores, of SaiiJDjeffQ,har J tor._Thirtv : nine. of her crew lie dead at
aty morgues, the fate of a dozen more is yet undetermined and
three-score are stretched upon beds of /pain in various x hospitals.,
This is the result of the explosion which wrecked the trim 'little:
naval craft and wrought such terrible havoc among her crew at
half-past 16 o'clock this morning.
The placid waters of San Diego Bay have never before been
the scene of such a disaster, and San Diego city has never before
been stirred by such scenes of death and suffering as those wit-
Twenty-one dead bodies lie ranged with grewsome precision
at Davis & Anderson's morgue. The ! stark forms are outlined in
immaculate winding sheets. Thirteen victims are stretched upon
improvised biers at Johnson & Connell's morgue, while five others
are to be seen at Woolman & Bradley's. The face of every victim
is scarred and scalded, in many cases almost beyond recognition,
Defective Boilers Said to Have
Caused the Terrible Disaster
At Agnew Hospital to-night are many injured, suffering in
almost every instance from scalded bodies. Several are expected
to succumb to their injuries before the night is over.
On board the Bennington the unharmed members of the crew
are working under great difficulties to reach the boiler-room and
coal bunkers, where it is believed a dozen bodies are lying wedged
in the wreckage or submerged iii the water, which fills that part
of the vessel.
The cause of the explosion, which, so far as ascertained, in
cluded boilers B and D on the port side, has not yet been deter
mined. There is talk among the crew of weakened and leaking
boilers, but until a thorough inspection of the wrecked boilers can
be made no definite official statement is obtainable.
Deep Intonation Accompanies
the Explosion on the Gunboat
The Bennington, which arrived at this port from Honolulu
last Wednesday afternoon, was preparing to leave port at half
past 10 o'clock this morning, and only awaited the arrival of Com
mander Lucien Young, who had gone ashore on official business.
With steam up and every preparation for sailing completed, the
vessel swung at anchor half a mile off the Spreckels wharf, opposite
H street \u25a0
Officers and crew stood idly about awaiting the arrival of the
commander and the order to heave anchor. Numerous small craft
swarmed about the bay, and the big ferry-boat Ramona was leis
urely churning its way across from, the Coronado side ot" the bay.
Suddenly there was a deep-toned, rumbling intonation, like a
distant explosion of dynamite,\and the Bennington was seen' to reel
and shake from- stem to stern ; a dense cloud of white steam shot
skyward, and the entire upper deck appeared to lift and then settle
back with a crash.
Before persons on shore and aboard the moving bay craft
awoke to the catastrophe enacted before their eyes men Avere leap
ing over the sides of the Bennington.
Commander Young Immediately
Orders the Vessel Beqcheci
First a fisherman's rowboat, then the. launch McKiriley, upon
which Commander Young had just embarked to 'board His "vessel

SAN DIEGO. July 2Lâ Thirty-nine dead

on the deck of a ruined vessel of tha
United States navy, scores -of men are
lying ; painfully Injured in sanitariums
and hospitals, and fifteen sailors ara
missing and probably have found death
in the waters of the harbor, as a result
of the explosion of a boiler on* board thÂ»
United' States gunboat Bennington at 10:10
o'clock this morning. .
V The Bennington' at the time of the ac
cident was lying In the stream just off
the 'Cotnmercial wharf; at -the foot of H

fronvthe Navy Department ~at Washing

where she was to meet the injured moni
tor "Wyoming" and ' convoy that : vessel to
Mare Island 'Navy 4 Yard. Steam waa up
and everything , was in readiness for sail
ing when ' suddenly, and without any
warning -whatever.' the starboard for
ward ' boiler exploded with a deafening
roar. ,
' " explosion was) a terrific one. Peo
ple - standing on the .m. m shore saw -a ) huge
cloud of .white steam rise above the"Ben

Into the air for a ".. distance of "nearly

coming across the" bay at the'' time of the
accident. Captain Bertelsen of the Ra

immediately and went to render, assistance. . \u25a0.- - -â¢ '\u25a0. >*> \-\u25a0 ~.
Commander Young boarded the Beimington but a few min
utes after the explosion. While there was much confusion among
those who escaped unharmed, the officers had already set about to
care for the injured arid look for the dead.
The Bennington began to settle rapidly, listing 'heavily to
starboard. Fearing she would sink, Commander Young ordered
the vessel taken in tow by the tug Santa Fe and one or two smaller
craft \u25a0\u25a0; . \u25a0 â¢\u25a0.V ',\u25a0 - .
Heading directly for the shore at the foot of H. street, the
Benningtcn was run into shallow water, where she lies to-night,
not more than 200 yards from the shore. She leans heavily to star
board, her bow upon the bottom and about fifteen feet of water
beneath her stern.
Terrible Spectacle Meets Gaze
of Rescuers on Stricken Ship
Steam still poured out of the ventilating funnels. and. through
every other aperture that gave an opening, from the lower regions
of the ship, and it was some time before rescuers ; could, venture
below. â¢ â¢ : . . . ; ; , : .
Xews of the .explosion spread throughout the city ; \vithin a'
few minutes. In response to calls:, ambulances, were hurried bay

city.. Besides these there were scores of volunteer carnages, : de
livery wagons and even more humble- conveyances hurried upon

extent of a fire engine, which was:* loaded .upon a. Hghter)ahH* run -
alongside the Bennington, where it is to be used to pump out the
vessel's engine-rooms. < :
The rescuers faced a terrible spectacle beneath the main deck ..
in the forward part of the vessel. Here the crew's "quarters are
4 located, and here, too, the greatest loss of life occurred. Many of-.,
the crew were in quarters, some swinging comfortably in their
hammocks. Dead and injured were taken out of this section to the *
number of almost two-score â just how many no one took the time
to count. - â¢ \u25a0 â¢
With remarkable promptness the victims were conveyed ashore
in launches and turned over to the waiting ambulances.

As boat after boat discharged its cargo of dead, dying or suffering sfamen/ :
the throngs, gathered at a respectful distance, stood in silent awe at the Bight "'
of death and heroic and patient suffering. Men there were whose bodies were
almost flipped by the terrific force of scalding steam, whose flesh was Â«woll6nÂ«'* :
and wnitened from the awful blast that swept up from 'the bursting boiler and
whose features were in many instances almost obliterated. There were- brave
men among the Injured, braver than the ordinary run of men, for few were the

Jury finished its : "<he&rihgVbf tHe^matter
and failed to^jr^tuni an '\u25a0Jndietmeht'

that the evidence was not sufficient- to
show that murder had been committed.
The rnembersCdecided that ,\t Â»new cvi-;

again take up tho case. 'When District
Attorney. Campbell was informed of the
jury's action, he ordered Sheriff Boss to
release Mrs. Hueter. 1
The hearing before the Grand Jury this
.morning was short. But two- witnesses
Vefe examined, Albert Hueter arid* Sheriff
"Sheriff. Ross told of his visit to the Hue
ter ranch the morning after the' killing
of Hueter. He told of the position of
the dead body as It lay on the bed, and
explained some photographs that had
been taken. He repeated the story Mrs.
Hueter had told him ofthe hilling of her
husband in self-defense. It is the same
as has already been published, .briefly,
sue said Hueter came . home * from San
Jose, and a quarrel ensued, during which
ho threatened to kiil her, and believing
her llfs wasin danger she s^ot him.
â¢ Albert' Hueter followed the Sheriff in
the jury room. : He told of *fiis stepmother
calling him oyef the telephone andtelllng
him that his' father had been- kilied. He
had hastened to the house, and, riding to
Alma, hud summoned physicians :. from
Los Gatos. '"â¢ H6 was. not "an eye-witness,
and could give little testimony in. regard
to the killing. Albert Hueter was ques
tioned in ;rogard r to the story -he. told his
father-on the day of the shooting about

WRECKAGE COVERS SHIP.
On bdard the Betinlngton was presented
a ' terrible scene. . \u25a0 ,\u25a0, \u25a0 1 . ** force of the ex
plosion had torn a great hole In the star
board side of the ship and the vessel wa*
already commencing to list. A section of
the upper deck was carried away from
stem to stern. Blood and wreckage cov
ered the entire ship, the After cabin and
the vicinity of the. snip adjacent to the
exploded boileri resembling a charnel
house. Over It all hung the great cloud
of * white smoke, which drifted slowly
toward the Corona do shore.
, The newa of ; the explosion spread over
the city like -wildfire. Hurrying am
bulances, hacks, carriages of every de
scription, which had been summoned,
added to the/ excitement. Every phy
sician who could be reached by telephone
was called to the water front. Within a
comparatively short time nearly a dozen
physicians were on the scene and tend
ing the wounded. -
A dozen Or fifteen of the men were
blown overboard by the force of the ter
rific explosion. Captain Wentworth. who
was looking at the . Bennington from th*
shore when the disaster occurred, say*
he saw human bodies hurled over a hun
dred ,feet upward. The air wm black
with smoke, which enveloped the ship.
When.'lt 7 cleared : away only a few men
could be seen oh the decks, while a. num
ber were floundering in the water. A
boat was lowered from the vessel's side
and most of them were picked up and
taken on board.
The shock of the explosion penetrated
to every section of the ship, blood and
ashes being found as far in the stefn
of the* captain's cabin. Portions of the
upper deck were carried away -and great
damage was done in alk sections. _ .
MAGAZINES FLOODED.
All the available power launches hasten-:
ed to the wreck, while most of the row
b'Sats laTbng^tfie bay^wtte Brotfghx into
.user. Most .of the deadend injured were
taken ashore? where the undertakers and
jphyslclans were assembled, the former to
takecharge of. the dead and the latter to
minister to .the needs of the. Hying. ;
The bodies of many' of th* meti takefl"
from' the wrecked Interior *of the 'ship
were mutilated almost beyond recogni
tion. -The faces of many were covered
with blood and ashes.
. Commander Young, as soon as he
reached the ship, gave orders that the
airtight. compartments be closed to keep
thfe - listing ship from sinking and that
.the magazines . be flooded to avert fur-,
ther explosions.,... ;: . . . ' '. "..?."
Temporary \u25a0 quarters- ashore .were. art.
ranged for the wounded. Sixty 1 citizen
volunteers hurried in launches to the re
lief of those on the ill-fated ship. : Some
of the volunteers were unable to' stand
the sickening sight which met .their gaze
on the Bennington. and. strong men grew
faint. As fast as the wounded could be
removed they were hurried in am
bulances, carriages, wagons and automo
biles to the hospitals. For a long time
the hot steam -prevented access to the
space between decks, , where inodt of tiie
dead bodies lay. and it was not until late
in the afternoon that thÂ«y were removed
from the boiler rooms. Several bodies _
were Â»o tightly. wedged in by a, bulkhead',
that the woodwork 1 had to b* -hewftdj
away to free them. Most. of the bodies
yet unidentified are mangled, almost be
yond hope oX recognition..
BOILERS DEFECTIVE. â¢
The Roller which exploded, it la iaid,
was regarded aa unsafe. Commander
Young stated that during the recent re
turn from Honolulu. the steam pressure
was kept reduced in that particular
boiler. When "the explosion ...occurred

IN THE DARK
AS TO CAUSE
OF DISASTER
Chief Engineer Eae of Navy,
Believes That the Boilers
Alone Are Not Eesponsible
for Great Loss of Life
Â»
CALL BUREAU. POST BUILDING.
WASHINGTON, July 2Lâ With the de
tails of Commander Young's reports fresh
in his mind. Charles W. Rae, engineer
in-chief of the navy, to-night said:
"Even with this inforamtion the cause
of the accident on the Bennington re
jpams a mystery to me. I cannot con
trive how the explosion of these boilers
could h&ve been sufficiently -severe to
cause the great loss of life sustained.
Commander Young's report Bays that the
top of the lower furnace, boiler B, burned
and exploded, forcing that boiler back to
contact with boiler D, which was In turn
exploded. I do not believe that the shell
of boiler E was bursted. lam unable to
conceive how that boiler could have been
forced aft; what force could have started
in that direction.
"Then, the report speaks of persons on
deck being blown overboard. This is
another thing which it Is hard to recon
cile with any of the ideas of the strength
of pressure In these boilers. This leads
me to believe that there must have been
something exploded besides the boilers."
"Are the magazines in proximity to
these boilers?"
"I am not precisely aware of the loca
tion of the magazines of the Bennington.
but believe that they were separated from
V the boilers by the fire room, which is
Jfnrward of the boilere. The ammunition
is stored aft in most of these chips, but
no report that we have heard anything
of mentions any explosion of ammuni
tion.
"The last log of the Bennington which
v.-c have received her e shows that the
eafety valve was , set to blow off at a j
' pressure of 145 pounds. The boilers were j
built to sustain a pressure of 160 pounds.
Now, when the top of the , furnace in
boiler B exploded, as it is reported to
have done, the pressure in the boiler
above was relieved."
Admiral Rae said he did not believe
there was any chronic defect in the boil
ers.
"Was there any recommendation made
for the immediate installation of a new
boiler which was overruled by higher au
thority?" was aEked.
"I do not believe so," replied the engi
neer-in-chief. "When last inspected it
was realized that the boilers would soon
' have to be replaced; but It wu decided
that repairs could be made which would
place . the ship in excellent cruising con
dl&m. Within a short time it would
have been necessary to put in ntw boil
ers.
"The boilers were built fifteen years
ago by the Quintard Iron Works of New
York for T. N. Palmer of Chester, who
built the Bennington, and are known as
the locomotive gunboat cylindrical
â¢ straightaway boiler. They are somewhat
different from the Scotch boilers, but
they have always given fairly satisfac
tory service and have not been suspected
- of defects."
FEAR LOSS OF LIFE.
Kantass Warned of Danger From Im-
V" pending Floods.
T GALENA. Kan., July a.â The flood con
ditions along Spring, River Valley, north
of this city, are more serious than ever.
Most of last night Spring River came up
at the rate of a foot an Jiour and to-day
Is still rising. Much mining ' land has
been flooded and mining operations have
been suspended. The St. Louis and San
Francisco Railroad bridge west of this
city is six inches out of line and has
been abandoned. To-day service was
blocked both east and west of Galena.
At- noon to-day a message from Pea
cocH Valley, a little mining camp sltu
*Â£tÂ£a east of Badger and on higher
[ground, stated that the water had just
commenced running into the mines . there.
People all along the river valley through
the Indian Territory have been warned
of the impending danger. It is ' feared
that there will be loss of life. The flood
district is close to the Indian Territory
line.

SAN DIEGO, July 2Lâ There are ugly
rumors floating about among the sur

sailors had declared that their death
was due to a boiler which has long been
known to be defective and should have

was inspected by the inspector
at Honolulu " only a short time before
the gunboat left for this city.
Fireman Top, who was on watch Just
shortly before the accicent, said the
boiler was leaking somewhat and he had
sent, to the boiler-maker to have it fixed,
but before it; could be attended to the
accident happened. From many members
of the crew, who were not willing that
their, names should be mentioned, it, was
learned that -it had long been expected
tliat the boilers would send them all to
"Davy Jones' locker" before long.
The bravery of the crew was comment
ed on, by all. Men who were themselves
injured and scalded worked hard to aid
those who were worse . off than- them
selves, and the special instances of hero
ism of the day probably will never be
fully written.' There were many self-sac
rificing I efforts on the part of the physi
cians and the army of nurses, for hun
dreds fof women of this city volunteered
to act as nurses/
All who could be made useful at the
hospitals were put to work, and those
who could not were asked to return and
relieve those who were accepted, g
Major Kneedler came over from Fort
Rosecrans to take charge of the work
on the wharf and handled the injured In
a manner to cause comment on all sides.
He was on the -Lerussy Â«hen the ex
plosion occurred, and as sodi aa.he went
on board he took personal- charge of the
case of Lieutenant Perry who was so
fearfully scalded that he died late this
afternoon at the â¢ barracks hospital. ; At

with those . of the Bennington, burst at
one time, killing two men.
Acting Secretary Darling and officers of

NEWS EAGERLY SOUGHT
BY ANXIOUS RELATIVES
Wife of Ensign N K. Perry Leaves San
Francisco for Scene Before Hear- ;
ing of Husband's Death.
The news of the Bennington disaster
was a , great shock to the men of the
navy stationed in San Francisco. All day
lcng the offices of Rear Admiral Henry
Glass, commandant of the United' States
Pacific Naval * District, and Paymaster
Richard T. M. Ball, In" charge" of .the naval
pay office, were besieged by anxious rela
tives and friends of â¢ those on board the
ill-fated vessel; for news of the disaster.
The; gloom. that naturally fell over army
circles here, due to the ~ frightful loss
that had fallen upon thel^brothers in
arms, was deepened ; byi the 'knowledge
that a son of Colonel Morris, the com
mander of the post at' th"e Presidio, was
among the number, who ' received severe
injuries. <
; The public at large felt v the disaster
keenly, as the Bennington has been so
long on this coast* that she 'is known
practically to every one having a knowl
edge of navy and army affairs.
At the' Merchants' Exchange the em
ployes were kept busy answering tele
phone calls from people. with anxious in
quiries for. the welfare of those on board
the unfortunate warship. No event of its
kind since the; loss of the _ Maine has
caused such deep interest, and such pro
found expressions of grief as the awful
disaster of yesterday. *
Mrs. Perry, wife of the young ensign
who was killed by being scalded, has
resided here for ' several months past at
the Hotel Cecil. Soon after the explosion
she received a telegram * from, her hus-

Come at once."
It was the first intimation that Mrs.'
Perry had received that any accident
had happened on board the Bennington.
She was naturally greatly alarmed. With
the assistance of her friend 3 in the hotel
she was made ready to proceed on the
Owl train last night for San Diego. The
youthful wife left here without knowing
that her husband had succumbed to his
injuries.
Colonel Morris and his family were
shocked when the first news came of
the awful disaster. It was several hours
after the explosion before news came
stating that young Morris, although hurt.
was not seriously Injured. Until the ar
rival of this message Mrs. Morris and her
daughter were nearly frantic with grief
and excitement.
Nearly all the officers at the post called
at the Morris home late in the afternoon
wifli expressions of congratulation that
young Morris has escaped with his life.
The Bennington sailed from this port
on May 17 for Honolulu, at which port
she arrived on May 27. She remained in
(he harbor there until July 9. when she
set sail for San Diego, where she ar
rived on last Wednesday, July 19.
At the time of the accident the Ben
nington was on detached duty. She had
been ordered to proceed to San DJego
and from there go to Port Harford and
convoy the monitor Wyoming to Mare
Island. - '.\u25a0 â¢'

Treasurer Dunn Called Upon
to Explain Discrepancies
in Accounts. . .
SACHAMENTO, July 21.â State Con
troller E. P. Colgran to-day filed in the
Governor's office the report submitted
to him by Deputy Controller D. A.
Moulton and C A. Root, who examined
the books and accounts of the State
Board of Dental Examiners at the re-
Quest of Governor Pardee. The report
does not charge "grafting," but some
clerical errors were found, all of which
were easily straightened out.
The report states that Dr. Dunn,
while Treasurer, came into possession
of $2827 belonging to the board on Sep
tember 15, 13V4. On October 21, 1904,
he deposited $2972 10 with the Crocker-
Woolworth Bank. The retention of this
money caused some comment, the re
. port states, but there Is nothing in the
,l&w. creating the board making imme
diate deposit of money obligatory. , One
part of the report reads: r - _. \u0084
We were unable to obtain the bank books
of former Treasurer Dunn, but ue'.ng a trans
cript o' the accounts as shown in the books
ci the beaks we found that there had been
at time* a Ciscrepancy In balances between
the oecretarr and the treasurer. The atten
tion of Dr. Dunn was called to this matter,
and be denied that any shortage had at any
tlmÂ« existed and explained the condition by
sitting that there was at the time the apparent
shortage was shown a balance to the credit
al the board In a Los Angeles bank,' an
amount sufficient to cover the seeming deficit.
The Los Angeles bank bock was requested of
Dr. Dusn. but he was unable to submit it,
etatln* thst it was in the possession of his
attorney. Senator G. R. Lukens.

MAYOR Â£CGEXE E. SCHMITZ. CHARGED BY THE
GRAND JURY WITH GROSS NEGLIGENCE OF HIS
ADMINISTRAY WITH GROSS NEGLIGENCE IN HIS .
Mayor E. E. Schmitz sat before the Grand Jury for two hours yesterday
afternoon and there suffered himself to be ceaselessly grilled with sharp,
stingir.gr questions concerning his personal administration of public affairs.
% report, presented in court later, of his alleged negligence in office and his
failure to keep sacred the high trust imposed on him by the people of San
Francisco was slowly and plainly read to him. At the end of the merciless
flaying for maladministration of the municipality he was allowed to go, and
although he would make no statement to the newspaper men who crowd
ed around him, yet it was plain to see from his excited manner and the
crimson flush of his cheeks that was only partly hidden by the black whis
kers that the snapping of the Grand Jury whip had roused his ire and that
the smarting of his wounds would last for many days.
The Mayor is accused by the Grand Jury's report of gross negligence in
the administration of public affairs. It is alleged that instead of turning city
money over to the treasurer within twenty-four hours -after collecting it, a*
the charter provides, x the chief executive fell behind in one Instance over
two years. It is charged that his delay in the report of investigation of the
affairs of Defaulter Smith cost the city large sums of money. He is accused
of failure to provide for the collection of the moneys owed the city, of failure
to carry out the theater ordinance, of violating the city charter by ap
pointing one public officer to another public office, by allowing Abe Ruef,
Lhroujrh his lieutenants, to collect money from civil service employes to
light civil service, of protecting houses of prostitution and of much other
lesrlcct of dntv. . \u25a0 - â¢ -â¢â¢
MAYOB TLEADS AVOEK AS AN EXCUSE.
To most of the charges the Mayor stated to the Grand Jury that he was
innocent. To some Schmitz said that he had done the best he could under
the circumstances and pleaded that the immense amount of work in his office
kept him so busy that he did not get the time to see personally' that all of
his subordinates carried out their duties exactly as the charter provided. He
stated thru he had not tried to collect moneys due the city because the
cost would be too great. Foreman Andrews then showed him the offer of
County Clerk Greif that with one extra clerk he could collect 75 .per cent
of the whole and the offer of another to this money for" 25' per cent
commission.
To the charge thaj $530 collected from the Widber,, property _In , rents was
lost to the city the Mayor stated_that this was lost through the failure of Easton,
Kldridge Co. He admitted that the city officials had not' turned in money as
poon as It was collected, but paid that he did not consider that this provision
of the chazter was to be strictly lived*up to and that he had. been too busy to
attend to those matters.. . -'\u25a0\u25a0::;\u25a0."- '"\u25a0*
He said that the investigation of the Smith defalcation took time and that
his rp:>ort was a mere technical matter and that he- waB not responsible . if the
surety companies were not forced to pay the bond. In the matter alleging that
he appointed Thomas F. Boyle to the Board of Education contrary to the pro
visions of the charter the Mayor said that he did. not consider a member of
the Board of Education a city official and that he acted upon legal advice. He
would not' give the name of his counsellor. '" . . , â¢ .
THEATERS WILL NOT OBEY CITY OBDINANCES.
The Mayor said that he did the best that he could to make the theaters
come up to the requirements for safety that have been prescribed, but that it
was impossible to keep them strictly to the law. He said that he had tended to
the case of the Baldwin Theater. \u25a0'
It was shown the Mayor that when the lessee of the Terrace Gardens applied
for a permit to conduct the place as a theater the request was denied, but that
the next day the license was granted on the application to run the place as a
restaurant and that it was in the same condition then as when the first permit
was denied. This Mr. Schmitz said he would look up. He also promised to look
up the alleged collections for. the Schmitz Club and the failure of presentation
to the city attorney of all contracts for his approval.
Police Commissioner Drinkhouse was also examined by the Grand Jury. tHe
was questioned in regard to the disposition of the remnants of the Sullivan es
tate. He had, charge of this estate when he was Public Administrator eight
years ago and" then he deposited the money in the Union Trust Company. Re
cently the Grand Jury heard that Jake Raver had obtained part of the cash and
th^t he was claiming the real estate in his own name on the Assessor's' books.
Dririkhouse stated that. the money was still' ln the bank and that his responsi
bility had ended in the matter. He was excused after a few minutes' ques
tioning.
The report of the Grand Jury, concerning the .administration /of 5 Mayor
Schmitz follows in its entirety:

REJECT OFFER
OF TYPOTHETAE
Pressmen Ecf use./ to Accept
Eight-Hour Day, Because
Printers Are Not Included
HIGGINS IS SCOEED
Favors the Terms That Are
Presented and Is Taken
to Task for It Warmly
After a stormy session of the Printing:
Pressmen and Assistants' Union held last
night -In the Alcazar building the propo
sition of the Typothetao for an eight
hour day for the pressmen but not for the
printers, as presented by International
\ President Higglna, was unanimously re
jected. The pressmen absolutely refused
: to co . back to work unless the compos
itors so with them.
'.This attitude on the part of the union
was taken because it was seen that the
object of the Typothetae In offering the
concession of an elxht-hour day to the
pressmen but not to the printers was for
the purpose of causing \u25a0 a contention In
the - unian ranks ' and by | this means de
feating the demands for which all had
been laboring. -
Organizer F. J. . Bonnlnyton, who cen
sured President Hijslna for the. stand ha
took In favoring the return of the press
men on the eight-hour schedule, read the
telegrams he bad received from Presi
dent Lynch of the Typographical . Union.
Lynch was strongly against the accept
ance of the offer in favor of the press
men, and sent a telegram to Bonnlngton
that if Hlggina refused to hold out for
the demands of the union the Typograph
ical Union would pay the pressmen strike
benefits. Last night's action in rejecting
the offer of the Typothetae will make
benefits necessary.
The meeting was stormy, there being
strong feeling expressed against those In
favor of accepting â¢\u25a0 any offers which
would not hold good 'for the two organ
izations. A committee from the Labor
Council was present, and Arthur Mac-
Arthur impressed it on the minds of the
men that if the pressmen went back with
scab printers a rupture would be opened
in the ranks of the two unions that would
take years to heal. He denounced Hig
gins in very strong terms for favoring
the terms offered by the Typothetae.
Hlgglns answered these denunciations
with the statement that he was only ac
ceding to the wishes 'of the men and got
them the eight hours that were asked
for. He placed the proposition â¢ before
them to act upon and said that if they
rejected it then a settlement for. both
would be attempted. "When the meeting
arose as one man and declared themselves
for rejection Higgins said. "I am game
and â¢ will . stay with you till the end."
At the regular weekly meeting of the
â¢ San Francisco Labor Council last night
President Will J. French stated that," the
Eign painting firm of Swan. & Co. had
signed on union terms with the executive
committee. The privilege of the floor
was accorded to A. Goldman of the firm
of Goldman & Co. to state his side of the
i controversy now existing.

told Relss he would turn the â¢ watch
over to the police, but he has failed. to
do so. The watch belonged to Chxlste

SAYS "HOLY JUMPERS"
TOOK WIFE FROM HIM
R. B. Hinton Will
Fight Divorce
Searches in Vain for
Woman He
Loves.
OAKLAND. July 2Lâ In x quest of his
runaway wife, who- he says was led away
from him two years ago by the erratic
sect of religionists known as "Holy
Jumpers," Roger B. Hinton of San Ber
nardina is in this city. He says he has
spent a fortune seeking her. Incidentally
he has employed counsel, to defend him
in an action for divorce- begun here on
June 4. Mrs. Hinton charges extreme
cruelty as ground for divorce, specifying
alleged acts of more or less remote dates.
Hinton and wife- were married at: At
lanta, Ga., in May, ISSB. They have no
children and the wife doeÃ not ask for
alimony. But Hinton, despite, the fact,
as he states, that she left- him to follow
the Holy Jumpers, seems to entertain a
feeling of strong affection for the wom
an. He has been Industriously seeking
her both in this city and Berkeley. He
has visited several houses reputed to be
occupied by Holy Jumpers, lettered about
the streets and followed every clew he
could get as to her whereabouts, but
thus far without success.
The trouble between Hinton and wife
seems to have begun In, faraway Ber
mingham, Alabama, where the wife be
came Imbued with a strong desire to fol
low the Holy ' Jumpers' teachings and
mode of llfe^ Â»One day, Hinton states, he
came home from hl3 duties as a railroad
employe to find his home deserted by
hfs wife. Then he discovered that she
had gone to another city. He followed,
hoping to find and win her back. He was
disappointed.
Through Georgia. Texas and into Red
lands, San. Bernardino and other Southern
California towns Hinton chased after his
fleeing spouse. But the Holy Jumpers
were always Just ahead of him. He lo
cated at San Bernardino more than one
year ago and has since continued to spend
time and money trying to locate his wife.
Service of summons In her action for di
vorce Informed him. that she was m Ala
meda County. Hinton hastened here.
Since his arrival he has haunted the
streets and places where Holy Jumpers
are supposed to have their habitations,
vainly seeking his wife. Last night he
for awhile thought he had her located
In a store In a local building, but if It
was Mrs. Hinton she got away without
her husband having an opportunity to
speak to her.
Hinton Is a tall, llght-complexioned
man, apparently of Scandinavian origin.
He will ask -the court here for a change
of venue in the divorce trial to San Ber
nardino, where he resides. Meanwhile
Hinton saya that he will continue â¢to
search for his errant spouse and spend
his last dollar seeking her.

Surfaces." The author said to-day, ex
planatory of the 1 ! work: "Geometry may.
be ; classified, from several points of
view. The first division that- it Is cus
tomary to make is between projective
geometry and metric* geometry. Anoth
er classification that might be adopted
Is between differential and integral ge
ometry. The subject of differential met
ric is well' known. The purpose of this
new work Is to develop the cognate
subject of differential projective geome
try."
The work of Professor- Wilczynski Is
to be printed by the firm of B. G. Peub

â¢ ATTACKS THE TREATY. -:,
VICTORIA, B. C, July 21.-George';D.
Collins^ on : trial . . for 33 extradition .on . . a
charge '.ot perjury committed >in Sari
Francisco, continued his" technical objec
tions this, morning' before Judge Lamp
man," fighting vigorously against being
surrendered. He contended" there could
be no extradition without a treaty and :
an ,; extradition , act going 1 J beyond /..the.
treaty\,was void, that there.can be rio ex
tradltable' offense unless ; ; it , was enumer-i
ated' in | a treaty "and* a â¢ statute * by<the'
Legislature- : is necessary .; to enforce* the
treaties. . '
He held that Canada went beyond the
scope of the treaty by the extradition
act- of 18S6 and that the act., in .which
perjury is made extraditable, is null be
cause^ it went beyond ; the" limits â¢of the
treaty, wmoh did not Include extradition "'
for perjury. The act of 1889 .omitted per
jury from it 3 list of extraditable offenses
and this act was consistent with the
Ashburton treaty of 1842, which omitted
perjury. He quoted numerous authori
ties in support of his technical objections,
not only to the scope of the treaty but
a3 to whethet. the affidavit made by him
in San Francisco in thÂ« maintenance suit;
constituted perjury. - \u0084:..* *-.'
Frank .-* Higglns, . counsel for the -San
Francisco' police, ; said that Collins jj had
failed ,to speak of the. Pauhcef ote-Hay,
treaty of : 1900, which was the last treaty
upon which an extradition act was based.
The acts of 18S6 and 1889 were to be' con
sidered together and ( they held that an
extraditable crime ; may be any described
In the schedule of the act. â¢ This,' argued
Hlggins, disposed of Collins' contention."
His contention, said Higglns, was "not
new.-; A case had - been decided * several
years before and ; upheld in an appeal
at Quebec by Judge Wurtele. in which
the sams-; points as have been raised by
Collins were presented. Although it was
contended that perjury was not an extra
ditable crime -because it-was omitted
from the schedule of the act of 1889, the
judge , held ; that . perjury was an extra
ditable* offense. : .. ; . . .
POSITION NOT, TENABLE.
Higglns \u25a0 said that* as this effectually
disposed of Collins' -contention,- there was
no use discussing it further. Collins, how
ever, went on to argue, that this ruling
did not cover the point and continued his
objection..'-.
. : Higglns â¢ argued that Collins, to swear
ing to the false affidavit In San Fran
cisco,- had committed, perjury within the
meaning: of the common law of Canada*
and quoted authorities to support his con
tention. As to the objections of Collins-,
they ..were - mere technicalities,, said ;Hlg
glns, k which ; were absurd when followed!
tola logical conclusion, as all. matters of
procedure : could not be Identical, in Cali
fornia and Canada. - For j instance." a man
may be , married by a- Justice of the, peace
In\Calif ornia, -but not In i Canada, and it
would : be'j absurd to '! contend \u25a0\u25a0 if i bigamy
were ".'; an }[ extraditable offense that the
California ceremony -did not 'constitute a
marriage In ; Canada, and â¢ that the ac
cused , would, ; i therefore, ':â¢ not .be' guilty.-of
bigainy^^; ; J. " ; ""-".V . ' ': ;^"'
: Higgins quoted numerous authorities in
support.' ; mcludlngr j a "case * tried Â« f n Call-;

the presiding; judge had decided ' against

BOYS MAY LOSE
THEIR EYESIGHT
An after-Fourth of July celebration on
a vacant lot off Henry, street between
Castro^ and . Church, in which dy
namite was the agent of explosion; - re
sulted seriously for three boys yesterday
afternoon. â¢ John Kavanagh, 13 years' of
age. residing at 212S Fifteenth street, and,
Robert Fisher, one year his senior", and
living at 111 Castro street, were seriously
injured and: may lose their eyesight.
Frank Cur rid, -also 13 years old, and re
siding at 151 Henry street, escaped more
fortunately, but he lies in the hospital
with his face and body badly burned and
torn. ',
, It appears from the report made by
Detectives Graham and Harrison that
several boys living in the' neighborhood
entered the quarry buildings ; of Qulmby.
& Harrelson at 105"'A*Â»den street and car
ried; off about seventy-five sticks of dyna
mite. ; This was shortly .before July A and
the boys, â¢ headed- by Edward Steengrafe,
planned an elaborate celebration on the
national '}. birthday. . The ' explosive was
hidden away in a sack, but the lads. had
too much to occupy their attention on the
day the feast- of- noise had been arranged
for and the deadly stuff lay in its place
of seclusion since that time.
Yesterday. 1 ; shortly after the noon hour,
that sack was . resurrected by several . of
the Juvenile : element, among ' them ' being
the . three boys who were Injured." There
were several other, boys nearby in a tent
but none of : these . suffered i Injury. â¢ Five
sticks of dynamite were", taken from the
original j package and : an \u0084 attempt was
made, to explode one of. them. The.pow
der, would not; go off and the lads started
to * work *on ;a â¢ second ', piece: " â¢ With fuse

PACIFIC MAIL COASTER COMES FROM SOUTH
Is Not Received at
Guatemalan
The Pacific Mail Company's little coast
er City of Panama,' Captain S. Sandberg,
arrived yesterday from Panama. She
reached port only a day late. This un
usual punctuality, however, was not due
to any sudden increase of vitality among
the cranks and rods of the Panama's
engines, but to the fact that she did not
call at any port uorth of La. Llbcrtad. On
account of the plague reported at the
isthmus neither Guatemala nor Mexico
would receive the City of Panama.
The Panama brought twenty-six pas
sengers, â¬77 tons of cargo and treasure
valued at $5950. J Among the passengers
from the isthmus was John Jenkins,
whose brother Is American Consul at
Salvador. There had been no fresh cases
of plague at Panama when the steamer
left there and the dread of an outbreak
was diminishing.
Â« The City of Panama reports that the
Mexican steamer Culiacan .was disabled
in heavy weather encountered off the
coast and was obliged to jettison 100 tons
of cargo. She was picked up and towed
into Mar.zanillo.
William Pascoe. a cabin passenger from
New York, died on board July 17. of old
age. He was buried at sea. Pascoe was
a forty-niner and a resident of San Jose.
He was 76 years old.
Captain B. Tilton, who once was in the
Pacific Mail service, was a passenger on
the Panama as far as Corinto. He was
returning from Europe, where he had
been buying a gunboat % for the N'icara
guan Government.
The ship Elwell was at Panama dls
-frarging the lumber she took there from
the Sound for the canal construction
work.

Red Rock Is Overdue.
The British ship Red Rock is once again
on the overdue list. She is bound from Ant
werp for this port and is out 176 days, fche
U quoted at 8 per cent. Much money was
cleared on the Red Rock a year or so ago by
reixunxuee speculators. bhortly after she
Jeft the Sound for Europe cases of salmon
were found on the beach of Vancouver Island.
According to the marks these cases had been
Mowed in the Ked Hock's lower hold. Long
t^iore she reached her destination speculators
were able to play her "to arrive at 9V per
cent She turned up in first-class condition.
*he had 'nst a few cases of salmon from
1' 'mall lot the carried on deck. There always
has been a suspicion of sharp practice in con
nection with the reports sent out from the
iK.rth about the marks on that Â«Â»Â»Â«Â»â¢\u25a0*
though investipation failed to fix the blame.
Bne was heavily played and much money was
gathered in by the speculators when the cable
reported "Red Rock arrived."
The French bark Lafayette was placed on
the board yesterday also at 8 P"** ll^: , **Â«

Pcterson's Whale Story.
Henrj . p e terson. the pioneer of all the water
front faunchmen. who is now located at the
Mission-street vharf bulkhead. has been
adopted by the whales that of late have been
seen In the bay and off the Cliff House. One
of Peterson's launches is engaged for daily
eerviee at the Mile Rock Lighthouse and Cap
rain Jack WriEht. who operates the launch.
is reÂ«'K>nsible for the statement that the whales
ate k'ndly disposed toward Henry Peterson,
champion oarsman, actor and launch magnate.
Every day. while Henry's launch has been
lying off the rook, whales, big and little, have
bobbed up in 'the close vicinity. Wright de
clares that one whale saved the launch frora
destruction. A sudden swell threw the boat
foward the rock. She would have struck, but
suddenly between boat and reef there arose
Â» whale's tail. "And it made the finest
fonder you ever saw," said Wright yesterday.
â¢â¢That whale just damped there and every
time there came a swell up came the tall.
and not even the P^nt on the boat was
â¢cratched."
May Have Be*n a PrUoner.
Anton Domingo, a fisherman, dragged out
of the bay yesterday morning a man who
had tied himself to a plank, on which he
was trying to paddle ashore. He told Domingo
that he belonged on Angel Island and was
on bis way to town to make a few purchases.
He voJunteered no further Information about
himse'f and declined to tell his name. Do
mingo landed the man at Sausallto and saw
r.o more of him. . . .

Government Will "Give a
Valuable Concession as a
s Bonus for Proposed Line
Among the recent arrivals at the St.
Francis Jiotel is E. C. Pomeroy of Mad
ison, N. J., who is interested in the
Nicaragua "\ Finance and '"â Improvement
Company, a newly incorporated con
cern that' has secured valuable conces
sions' from the Nicaraguan Government,
among them a right to build and oper
ate 450 ' miles of railroad in the Central
American republic. Pomeroy has come
here for the purpose of conferring with
others who are interested in the com
pany with him. Among the local stock
holders are Banker W.H. Crocker and
Frederick Greenwood, the well-known
young capitalist. Another prominent
factor in the company is Joseph D. Red
ding, the well-known lawyer and club
man of NNet York,w t York, who formerly lived
in this city, and who is president. of the
company. .'-.â¢â¢-
Attorney Redding came here from
New York several months ago'ln con
nection with the Nicaraguan- company's
affairs and has been in conference with
Pomeroy and others at the St. Frapcis
Hotel. Although the promoters of the
enterprise are maintaining a great deal
of secrecy regarding their venture, it
has been learned that they have been
assured a bonus of 2,420,000 acres of
land, which has an estimated value of
5148,900 in gold. It is said that the
greater part of the-,* capital.! necessary'!
to inaugurate work on the railroad has |
already been subscribed and that sur- j
veys are now being completed for the !
line. The latter will have a terminal
at Nicaragua's sea ports and will fur
nish a much needed means for develop-,
ing the interior of the Southern repub
lic and facilitating the handling of the
native products.
Disappears on Eve of Marriage.
', Edward Johnson, an electrician, . has
disappeared on the eve of his proposed
marriage, and his fiancee and her moth
er are conducting an industrious search
for the young man. Miss Gertrude
Burnham of 915% Natoma street was to
be his bride and the wedding was to take
place next week. Miss Burnham sus
pects that Johnson has met with foul
play. Her mother does not think that
such is the -electrician's fate, and be
lieves that Johnson has found another
girl. The police have been notified and
are aiding in the search for Johnson.

PROTECTING THE FORESTS.
THE CALL recently inquired about the operation of the law
passed by the last Legislature for the protection of California
forests from fire. Since then we learn that the State Board of
Forestry, consisting of the Governor, Attorney General and Sec
retary of State, has elected Mr. E. T. Allen State Forester. -From
an interview it seems that the new forester has been living in the
East, and applied for the position as a relief from the confinement
of office work, having had, in the 'past, experience in forestry.
He intends to first interest the county authorities in the estab
lishment of forest patrols and brigades in the mountain and forest
districts, and will visit the State forest parks and perfect plans for
their protection. But it seems that no money is available for the
work and Mr. Allen hopes to interest men to serve as fire wardens
ar}d get a sufficiently organized force to enable him to inform the
next Legislature as to the amount of money necessary to make his
scheme of protection available.
The fire wardens are to have police authority, which is good as
far as it goes. What is needed is ; such organization and as
will compel the careless or the criminal incendiaries who start forest
fires to respect the law and those who administer it. The firing of
the forest should be treated more seriously by the law by making it
an oifense with penalty so serious that a few convictions will ad
monish others that setting out fire, or permitting it to escape, bounds
by carelessness, is no light matter, but is to be punished as a serious
public crime. It will be economy for the StaÂ£e to appropriate
enough money to make Mr. .Allen's work effective.
The Board of Forestry, it will be seen, consists of ex-officio
members, with the exception of the State forester. As a rule it is
a ,mistake to constitute an ex-officio board for such purpose. The
Governor, Attorney General and Secretary of State have about all
of the legitimate official work they can attend to, and without fault
of their own may find but little time left to give to this important
work of protecting the forests. Under such circumstances, however,
good results may be obtained by putting authority and large dis
cretion in the hands of the Chief Forester, who is the executive
officer of the board.
We are just in the midst of the season of forest fires.; The
risk increases with the movement of mountain campers. and live
stock herders, and becomes acute when the open .season for hunting
comes. Guarding the forests is new work for the State. Fighting
fires is an old and painful experience. In every county that isin
terested there should be found one or more seasoned fire fighters,
willing to be appointed warden, with police powers, authorized to
impress fire fighters into service if need be, and qualified to detect
and arrest and bring to punishment all parties responsible for a fire.
The State loses enough merchantable timber in one season's fires
to pay for protecting the forests for many seasons. This season
the losses in ranch property have been serious, probably' more so
than ever before. Ranch buildings, fences, crops and pasture have
been destroyed? inflicting very serious losses.. As the settlements
extend in the mountains such losses will increase every year.
Cities maintain a paid fire department for the protection of
buildings, and it is just as much the duty and proper function of
the State to maintain a force to protect forests and other property
in the country from destruction by fire.
Mr. Allen will have the hearty co-operation of the people in
doing what he can with the very insufficient means which the law
seems to have provided. As up to this time there has been no pro
vision whatever, it must be admitted that we have at least taken a
step in the right direction. The ex-officio members of the Board of
Forestry are all men capable of judging the work laid put by Mr.
Allen, and they all have official access to the Legislature, in their
reports, by the Governor's message, and in person. Under such cir
cumstances the State will be fully informed in this important matter
and the Legislature can act advisedly. Meantime this and another
summer and season of fire must pass, and the Chief Forester will
have a chance to prove his mettle.
THE HINDOO AND THE MOSQUITO.
pvROFESSOR KOCH of Berlin has been investigating the dis
r"^ ease-spreading insects of Africa. The terrible tsetse fly of
*\u25a0 that country has the power to exterminate all four-footed ani
mals of certain races. Koch now indicts the tsetse of the crime
of spreading that form of dropsy called the "sleeping disease," which
kills thousands of the African natives. He also found a small sand
tick that spreads a fatal fever among men. He says, however, that
the tsetse can be rendered harmless by simple means, and ; from
Afric's sunny fountains comes a cry for the means.
These discoveries of the great German bacteriologist are given
to the world concurrently with the discovery at Criton, East Indies,
of a bulletin issued in Sanskrit 1500 years ago by a nameless Hindoo
medicine man, who had investigated the agency of the mosquito in
spreading malaria and other diseases. He found sixty-seven differ
ent kinds of mosquitoes, and forty of them breeders of malaria.
After the Hindoo fashion he did not explain how he reached ,this
conclusion, but merely stated it dogmatically. The good Hindoo
has been in Nirvana many years, waiting for modern science to
vindicate him. We had to declare war against Spain to find out the
evil doings of the mosquito and prove, scientifically, his conclusions.
Now there. is no. room for doubting that ticks, flies and mosquitoes
are the enemies of the human race, as well as the destroyers of its
comfort. It is time to put aa end to these small torments.. Science
has demonstrated that no mosquito no malaria. Now let science
rid us of the mosquito so that our teeth may chatter ho more
forever.
But why does not some one investigate the flea? He feeds on
the dog and cat, and then jumps that game and attacks man. What
does he bring with him, besides his. appetite and agility?. If other
insects carry germs, why not the flea? We can't exclude him with
wire' screens. We are not informed as to his life history. We only
know that he is a holy terror in church, school and theater. He
shares our couch and disturbs our sleep. A bas le flea!
DOUBLE-BARRELED CONSCIENCE.
S-> CORPORATION ATTORNEY JAMES B. DILL of New
( ' York delivered a strong address at Oberlin College, Ohio, in
N-*. which he stated that the cause of to-day's evils is not that
our theories of corporation law, of finance or of politics are wrong.
They may be wrong in these, but that is not what he calls "the"
wrong. He throws the blame on personality and says we are not
honest. A result of this common lack of honesty is that men of
power, financial or political, develop a double-barreled ;cohscience.
Men try to do corporate business upon one basis and have another
kind of a conscience -for individual life. It is not so much doing
wrong things; it is permitting such things to be done in syndicates
and corporate aggregations which the -individual would not -do' in
private life. This results in the total * suppression of individual
morality. > \u25a0 ; ':\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0'-.\u25a0
In the stress laid upon the necessity of. personal honesty; the
speaker did not forget to point out that. after the first duty of re
forming self is worked on, the' next step is. to insist on the,. reform
of others. "We want men and women who not only; .will not lie,
nor steal, nor cheat, nor bribe, but who will make crimes criminal
arid fraud and graffa disgrace, even though they be successful, even
though the wrongdoers live next door, belong to our club, go to bur
church." His cry is "back to the beginnings," and he means by
that the ten commandments. ; It is evident from his , study of life
that Attorney Dill has noted the evil of the mob spirit, the weak
ness of being imitative, the willingness to follow the crowd of seem
ingly reputable people into unscrupulousness, though we might be
too much afraid, or too conscientious, to initiate the graft.

REFORMING A MAN THROUGH LOVE
There Is No; Limit to Its Power to Trans

I /jilove?" ,ts a question iltam asked to discuss.
m^"; The other day I heard a -company; of \u25a0people debating the
' 'came questjon and was interested to note how earnestly all ot
therai^ entered into 1 the'arigum'ent. '];' _4 : ) *. ; . -
The emphatic opinions .of one man, who seemed rather 'to glory in
. his pessimism" than to be ashamed'of it, held my attention" particularly be
.cause they were io completely at variance with the advanced thought of
. to-day. He, said in substance:, = .
'.'Any -woman 19 a' !fool";who beiieves love, or. . any. -other. , lnfluence^can,;
transform a man's nature. The man who leads a dissipated life does so
because: he :prefers that ;sort of existence. It is In his nature to care for it.
He can't be anything else. A man of "pronounced evil tendencies, one^
whose tastes have -become/ coarsened through contact with' the "grosser
side of; life, whose ..very thoughts have become soiled by the past life he
has led, cannot.be changedibylQve or any other process into a person of
cleahi habits, pure ' tastes and-hign alms. '* No . matter how hard a mans may
try to reform, he canhot^uproot propensities that. have become permanent.
All the forces of nature are against him in his struggle. When you at
tempt to combat nature you hght a losing battle.".. ~
I: have laid stress upon this man's utterances because they represent so
accurately "a phase of human belief that belongs to a vanishing. era. This
belief is; directly opposed to the new era of optimistic thought that recog
niaÂ«s no conception of "life not based on the principle of evolution. .
It is ignorance to contend that nature Is against any human being who
strives to overcome his lower' propensities. In the light of to-day's dis
coveries we may decidedly assert Instead that Just the reverse of this Is ,
true." ' '' a \u25a0
The clearer thought of the times recognizes evolution as a fact not
only of the physical world, but of the spiritual as well. Listen to this
splendid ; statement by. Henry Prunimond: \u25a0\u25a0'\u25a0 {\u25a0>.
j- \u25a0"Wvolutioh has ushered a new hope into the world. .The supreme message of
scienco to this age is that all nature- is on the side of the man who tries to rise."
And this: "An ascending energy is In the universe and the whole moves. on
with^one mighty idea and' anticipation."
This divine impulsion In, nature is so invincible that the rnan{wno leagues his {
hilrid with it has absolutely nothing to fear. He can not 'help" but evolve.' It is
impossible' that he should ever be lost or damned.
â¢ This is the sort of salvation I belfeve in, : The world has been held long
enough' by the old concept of manâthat he Is by nature evil and has all the
powers to'fight ; if he would'becqme good. - , .:.
; -In 'the light of the higher discovery we may declare that there Is no such
thing as a nature hopelessly: bad; There is no Â«uch fact: as a^pernjaaently evil
character. v No man is bound , to his lower, nature... No man has sunk to depths
from which he can not rise.' - ' ,V
;_ Low tastes, base propensities, weakness, sinâ all these are transient. The
only permanent act' about any; human' being, the*oPly>verlaBflng truth concern
ing him is that this mighty law/of growth and change Is pushing him on up
through, sin r and suffering and ignorance to the knowledge of his high destiny.
"Does 1 a woman ever really succeed in reforming; a man through love?'.'. :
* Most emphatically, yes. Love Is one of the eternal forcesâ a very factor in
evolution; It is im-lnclble and Irresistible.' There i la i no limit to the transforma r
tiorr'lt can effect In the character and nature of a human being.
;;; But the man who would outlive his past must take a ! definite stand for the
goodâ must consciously co-operate with the nigher energies.
"Oride he hafe positively Joined 'forces with the right, there is no power In the
earth) nor under the earth, nor anywhere ; in this vast universe that can keep
him from his goal. He Is bound to arrive. '
KNOWING ONE'S LIMITATIONS.
YOUTH is confident and pushing; age grows doubtful and cautious. If a
wise combination of the two states of being could \ be made to last
throughout life, it would be bettter for the world.
The only manner in which such a course can be devised is by making a
careful study of one's capacities and limitationsâ a difficult thing to do in youth.
In the spring of life there is so much to see and learn outside "of one's self that
few thoughts remain to flow inward; in age the process reverses again.
T~But 'one should begin learning just how far hia will j and, talent will take
him as early 'tin-- life as possible. It prevents "scattering and gives him the beat
chance to v center his ambitions on definite objects.""' :: v
â¢ While- It is* perfectly true that one cannot tell what one will do until
the time, comes, equally true that increased responsibilities frequently bring
increased means for bearing them, the world" is" too- likely .to forget that fail

people ever ventured to address to him
remarks bordering on a personal na

were, every one, feminine women, even

Altogether, the Susan B. Anthony Club

JEWISH HAMLET,
THOUGH ODD,
IS INTERESTING
Hamlet . as a young Jewish student.
King Claudius as a comedy rabbi, Polo
nius as the village villain, the Ghost as a
headâ something like a property John the
Baptist's but â¢ ghosting it under the
ten " r commandments of the Jewish
home altarâ are some of the features of
the "Jewish Hamlet," last night enacted
at the Grand Opera-house by Mr. Gllck
man and his players. The "Jewish Ham
let." too. settles the question of whether
Hamlet was mad. Stoned In a riot in
cited by the Rabbi Tudros (King Clau
dius) Hamlet, accused of nihilism, rushes
in with bloody face and goes temporarily
mad, In the hero of "Ghost's" fashion.
The curtain falls on him gibbering over
his mother's corpse; she has been stoned
by the mob. He marries the dead Esther
(Ophelia) In the last act, in order to save
her reputation among the ladles of
heaven.
It Is all very naive, yet reverent. Shake
speare faithfully reduced to the terms of
modern Polish Jewish life, and interest
ing no end from every side- Mr. Bernard
Schoengold is the Hamlet. He Is force
ful and picturesque in the role, tremen
dously In earnest and convincing through
the eheÂ«r sincerity of his work. Mr.
Gllckman himself Is the Polonlus, In red
beard and curls, and amusing as he is
intended to be. Miss Clara, Raff alo has
little" to do as Esther, but is pleasing In
that little, and Dvorah (the Queen) Is
well interpreted by Mathilda Flnkelsteln.
Morris Goldberg is the Itabbi Tudros. The
rest filled in well, and the audience gave
large token of enjoyment. The play will
be done again to-night. "Kol Nidrey"

VLSIER MEETS DEFEAT IN
TRYING TO RESCUE MONEY
Excites . Officials"' ot Local Banks, but
Modified Injunction Finally
Stops Him.
Moses Ulmer was defeated yesterday
in an attempt to evade the injunction
issued on complaint of his wife." Car
rie, restraining him from drawing
$40,000.' Â«he alleges is community prop
erty, out of the German Savings and
Loan Society. Atrs.v .Ulmer asks
for a division of the money, alleging
that her /husband has mistreated her
and will squander the whole amount if
given an opportunity.
As Â»oon : as Jthe" Injunction .was served
on Ulmer fte hurried to the California
Baf e Deposit and Trust Company and
after depositing. s9ooo in.. v cash pre
sented a certificate of deposit on the
German Savings and Loan Society' for
130,000, receiving in return'a certificate
of deposit for $39,000. When, the trust
company went to cash Ulmer's order, on
the German Bank, however, It was re
fused payment, as the German 'Bank
had been served with the injunction.
Then i there was some great scurrying
on the part of the trust company to
prevent Ulmer from negotiating- the
certificate of deposit Finally Mrs.
Ulmer's attorney went before Judge
Troutt and got a modification of the
injunction, permitting the German Bank
to pay the trust company, but restrain
ing the trust company in turn from
paying Ulmer the amount of his de
posit. -.
The banks have all been notified and
Ulmer will not be able to repeat his
experiment In evading the injunction.
Furthermore another attempt will ro
sult in his citation for contempt.;

Fairfax Wheelan delivered a straight

exist in some of the large cities of; this

the example, and he was sure the rest
would follow. :In past years, he I said,
only about 40 percent of the, voters of

NATIVE BOXER RETAINS
LEAD IN EVERY ROUND
Washington Lad Fights Like a Trojan,
Always Wading In and Trying
Plumber Boy Us.s Both Right and Left
and Lands Without Effort.
Jimmy Britt last night demonstrated
that he is every inch a champion. For
twenty rounds he hammered and punched
Kid Sullivan, of Washington, around the
ring at Woodward's Pavilion and emerged
from the fray without a blemish, and
as fresh as when he entered it. In de
feating Sullivan. Britt beat one of the
toughest and gamest boys who ever
donned a mitt in thi* oily. tÂ£very one who
caw the battle admitted that the native
eon fought the fight of his life, and that
he showed class no other man of his
weight ever displayed here. '
From the moment the b-li brought the
rival gladiators together in the first
round till Referee Jack Welch placed his
hand on Britfs shoulder, the naCtive son
was doing the fighting. He used rig Jit
and left at will, ducked, blocked, danced
away and roughed it. In fact, he per
formed every feat known in the moaern
prize ring and proved a better man than
Sullivan at them all.
Sullivan made a showing that caused
the members of th e sporting fraternity
to open wide their eyes and wonder.
Never for a moment did the strapping
little Washington lad stop In his effort
to land a telling punch. Time and time
again Britt would whip his unerring left
and terrific right into the stomach ana
on the point of the. jaw. yet the game
little man who was taking them all did
not hesitate, but came back for more
all the time, always willing to mix it and
fight.
There was not a dull moment in the
fuil twenty rounds of the go. The fight
\u25a0was not so sensational as others in which
Briu has starred, yet it was intensely
inti resting and full of action for the
reason that both men were milling their
hardest all the time and looking for a
chance to land a punch that would bring
home victory.
Britt Inflicted enough punishment on
Sullivan to beat two ordinarj* men. On
several cccaslons it seem-, d that the
stranger was about to sink to the floor
and allow the ten fatal seconds to be
tolled off. But Just when he seemed
gone, tho Washington scrapper would
raliy and come back with as much steam
and vitality as before. He was always
dangerous and Britt knew it, consequent
ly he was kept continually on his guard
in order to evade tho mad rushes and
mean swings aimed at him.
BRITT SCORES KNOCKDOWN.
Britt scored the only knockdown of the
fight in the eighth round. It came about
after a hot :nix-up in which Britt shoveil
in two wicked jabs to the .law, then
brought over a right hook that took the
Washington boxer off his teet and sent
him to the floor dazed and groggy. He
stayed down for eight seconds and when
he arose was forced to clinch in order to
save himself from being knocked com
pletely out. Britt was trying to land the
final punch, but the wonderful recuperat
ing powers of his opnonent saved him.
The usual mob was present when the
men entered the ring. A noticeable fea
ture of the evening was the cool recep
tion tended to Battling Nelson. When
the Dane entered the ring and announced
his intention of meeting the winner he
was greeted with cries of "Knocker,"
mingled with hisses. True, he had his
friends who cheered, but the general pub
lic seemed dissatisfied with the attitude
of the Battling one and were not slow to
chow It. It was a vast conrast to the
rousing welcome Nelson received at the
Wftite-Britt fight.
Britt was very effective in the early
rounds and was practically doing all the
work for the first part of the figiu. Then
Sullivan began to rally a bit and put in
the only blows that counted. Britt was
evidently figuring on a knockout In the
first ten rounds and many times tried
hard to land the decisive punch.
When Sullivan refused to slow up a
bit after taking a world of punishment
Britt displayed the good judgment of let
ting him rush for a while, always meet
ing him. however, with his unerring left
jab to the jaw. During the fourteenth,
fifteenth and sixteenth the Native Son
adopted this plan and though some of
the hoodlums In the gallery Jeered and
euggesed that he go In and fight Jimmy
only Emiled and pursued his wise course,
landing all the time with telling effect.
When Britt came up and fought hard
er than ever In the last three rounds the
knockers caw that he was still there and
out to win by the knockout route if he
wanted. He forced Sullivan all around
the ring In these periods and had the
milling Just as he wanted It. He took
chances, but got away with them and
there was nothing to it At the finish.
SULLIVAN LOOKS GOOD.
When the bell brought the two to
gether Britt fiddled around a bit and
landed two lefts to the Jaw as a starter.
He was there with his usual crouch,
while Sullivan also struck an attitude
something similar, though not as grace
ful or effective. Britt loomed up like a
wejl trained athlete, while his opponent
wss shefcthed in muscle and brawn, and
bespoke the fighter in every particular.
Britt had his own way in the opening
round. He was quick to land with his
left, sending it into the head and body
several times. Sullivan proved a clever
blocker and warded off many blows that
would have made him wince. He laid a
couple of light ones on Britfs body, but
they did not count. < 4 . ;
The second round was fast, and Britt
had It a mile. Sullivan continued to
block cleverly, surprising both Jimmy
and the crowd by the way in which he
kept wardinc off the jabs and hooks
Britt aimed at him. Britt was sizing up
his man in this round, and when it came
to a close he seemed to know just about
what to do. Sullivan opened up the
third by rushing Britt Into a, corner, but
the latter very cleverly ducked out of it
and repaid Sullivan with a few stinging
lefts to the Jaw. Britt followed up his
advantage by bringing in a couple of hard
rights Vo the body that made Sullivan
wince.
In the fourth Britt took a commanding
lead. He began to use bis right with tell
ing effect, bringing it into the body true
&s a die after first leading to the head
with his left. Sullivan was unable to
block any of these punches and the
plumber boy just kept showering them
In. Sullivan landed a light left to the
jaw, but it did not count.
Britt continued to* force the millinc In
the next period. He was there with the
right as well as the left and jabbed Sul
livan all over the ring. He danced
eround In clever fashion, and when Sul
livan showed a tendency to rush. the go
ing Jimmy always met him half way and
shot m his left. The plumber.' boy adopt
ed the same tactics in the sixth, whipping
tn some terrific rights to the stomach
that did not do Sullivan any good. Sul
livan was bleeding badly about the nose
and Britt never missed a chance. to shoot
In his left to the'lnjured bjxH. -
- SEVENTH â¢ UOI7ND HOUGH.
The seventh was a rourh round. ; Both
BRITT EARNS THE VERDICT OVER SULLIVAN
men were fighting hard. Britt thinking
he had a chance to finish Sullivan. The
â¢ latter was advised to wade lii and - take
it chance, which he proceeded to do.. He
rurhed Brjtt around," but the latter was
as clever as ever and, after getting out
j of the corners, he would invariably Jab
Sullivan and then bring the right .into
'the stomach: Entt landed a light left
to Sullivan's jaw after the gong sounded
and the Washington boy w.ni at him
like Â£ bulldo**. The seconds of both men
separated them and sent them to their
coiners.
\\ hen they came up for the eighth
round the boxers snooze hands and went.
\at it again. Britt began to force the
| milling and overlooked no chance to shoat
| in that unerring left a;id counter with
j the right to the stomach. After hooking
Sullivan a couple of times on the jaw
\u25a0 after a cinch, Britt brought- the right
i over and Sullivan went to the carpat,
i the only knock-down of tr-e go.
Sullivan rushed in during the ninth and
I landed a fairly good left to the jaw, fol
i lowing with a right that did little nam
! age. Sullivan waded in again and landed
j anoth< r to ihe same place. In the mean
; time Britt kept jabbing away, but Sulii
j van manage to get in the most effective
; blows. Britt punished Sullivan fiercely
. In the tenth round, swinging rights and
' lefts to the jaw and boring into ,the
: body. Sullivan was fighting hard and
i came back at Jimmy, with a couple of
i gcod suft ones to the head which shook
J the plumber boy up a bft.
In the twelfth and thirteenth the milling
was fast and furious. Sullivan kept up
his rushing tactics, while " Britt jabbed
and swung in with his right when he saw
a chance. In Â»he clinches, Sullivan tried
to work the kidney punches, but Jimmy
very cleverly guarded himself, keeping his
arm low so that Sullivan was compelled
to hit over it and, therefore, he could
not strike an effective punch in the
mix-ups. Britt worked this scheme all
through the fight and he got away with
it so well that Sulnvan was unable to
whip In his favorite blow.
EASTERN -MAX FIGHTS. .
Althougn bleeding and apparently in a
dazed condition, Sullivan was right at
Bntt In the fourteenth and fifteenth,
fighting furiously. Jimmy saw that the
chances of knocking out his man were
slim, so he let the latter rush around,
meeting him with that jab and dancing
away when the kid rushed. Jimmy rested
up in these rounds, while Sullivan tired
himself chasing around the ring and hit
ting the wind.
britt continued to stall around in the
sixteenth and Sullivan : began to get wor
iled. He was tiring of the chase, and
Britt kept smiling and jabbing away with
his left on that sore nose. Occasionally
he would whlr> In a right at-close quar
ters, but took good care that Sullivan did
not bring that haymaker any too near
his head. Jimmy was fighting cautiously,
as he knew he had the battle won and
did not want to take any chances, for
Sullivan had a punch left.
Jimmy cut loose a bit in the seventeenth
and landed a few that v rocked Sullivan
from the bottom of his feet. It looked
like the champion would bring in the
knockout > but Sullivan managed to
weather the storm and came up strong
when it locked bad for him. He kept
rushing and kept after Britt till the bell
rang.
Britt cut loose in his old time form dur
ing the eightenth. He wanted to show
the gallery gods up and let them know
that ne was still in the going as strong
as ever. He ducked a few of Sullivan's
wild rushes ana always repaid the lat
ter with a few jolts and jabs to the jaw
and they counted. Sullivan was getting
tired and slacked up. When Britt saw
this, he rushed in and. varied the game
by whipping his right Into the pit of the
stomach.
Britt was even faster in the next round.
Sullivan, as usual, came with a rush and
seemed intent on bringing one over on the
jaw. Britt kept his left working like a
piston and shot the rJght into the. stom
ach whenever he saw the chance. Sulli
van again tired and seemed to waste a
lot of energy in aiming swings that Britt
always got under while the crowd ap
plauded. â¢ \u25a0 . 'â¢.-...
Britt did all tae work in the last round.
After the men shook hands Britt put his
left to the jaw and whipped in a terrific
left hook to the stomach. He. kept this
up continually, not allowing Sullivan a
single chance to get at him. The latter
was still in the running and thought he
had a chance with that haymaker. But
Britt only smiled and peppered with both
hands. He ended the fight by whipping
three hard lefts into the stomach.
CROWD CHEERS WILDLY.
The crowd cheered like mad- when
Referee Welch placed his hand on Britt's
shoulder. The plumber boy came over
and shook the hand of his game little
opponent. Sullivan knew he was beaten
and did not' expect any other verdict.
He was applauded by the spectators for
his wonderful showing and took his de
feat like a man.
Sullivan was outclassed, but proved a
willing boxer who Is able to take a punch
and come back for more. He was slow
on his feet and unable to lead. He
showed up best in the Infighting, but
Britt managed to guard himself so well
in the clinches and mix-ups that the
Washington" boy was unable to chow his
true worth as an Inflghter. Britt devel
oped a system of blocking last night that
was the most marvelous ever seen here
and' every one admitted he put up the
greatest battle of hla career.
While waiting for Britt and Sullivan
to enter the ring. Announcer. "Billy" Jor
dan presented "Cute" Eddie Hanlon, who
challenged the winner. He also read a

Owing to a lack of resin in Sullivan's
corner, there was some .delay. Pictures
were taken of the men and then the gong
sounded, sending tlfe pair' on their
twenty-round journey.
FAIL TO STIR BEAM.
Both Britt and Sulllvnn Slightly Un

The usual large crowd watched
Britt and Sullivan' weigh in at Harry

fighters stripped and stepped on the
scales and neither man budged the
beam, showing! they were 1 under the
required weight, 133 pounds. *J . ,

fing his overcoat, 'the Olympic' Club's
pride stepped on .the scales and
weighed 130% pounds with his clothes
on. This satisfied Jimmy and he ; kept
up an animated chat with Nat Goodwin
and the newspaper representatives. - \
Sullivan came in with Al Herford,; his
manager 'and trainer, and both boxers
shook hands and sized each other up.
"Shall we weigh in now?" asked
Britt < \u25a0- !

Easy to Decide.
1 Brttt outclassed â Sullivan all
the way. There vran not a round'
I conld kl vo to Sullivan, although
he made it close in many rounds.
Sullivan bad nothing; to his. credit ,
but ffanieness and ability to take
a grueling;, j He was a danger
ous i fellow and had his right I
hand ready .at all times tor use,
but he could not land It, an Britt:.
\u25a0was too- wary for.- him.â Britt .
fought a great battle . and j | de- '
serves all the oredlt-for his show
ing. He is a clever, tiro-handed,
fighter and has a great-head. :. He : .
is a grrnt ring general and used
superb judgment. The condition'
of both men ims perfect. Both',
fought dt-anly " and * it was an.
Ideal ' fis;ht to referee, r "They *"
broke Instantly when; I told them
to and ' never attempted fouling. *
Sullivan is an "Iron man." He'
certainly can take a punching;. I
heard lie broke his left hand J'la'
the tenth round.' In my opinion
he could not beat -Britt if he \u25a0

DEFIES RACING STORY THAT
t\ \V*.S SENT FROM SEATTLE
Horace I'srhert Declares Emphatically
He Ilai No Interest Whatever In
the Hone Horatlua.
Recent stories emanating from Seattle
to the effect that Horace Egbert and
Frank Skinner of this city, who acted
es judge and associate Judge of the race
meeting that closed there a week ago
Wednesday, are Joint owners in the
horse Horatius, which won an impor
tant handicap In the last day's racing,
has brought an emphatic denial from
Eg^bert. It was charged In the dis
patches from Seattle that while Hora
tius was being raced In the name of
Tobey Ramsey he really was owned by
Egbert and Skinner, and that the fact
was likely to cause an Investigation.
In & dispatch to The Call last night
Egbert brands the story s-s a falsehood
and positively Insists that he had no "In
terest in that or any other horse that
was racd at the Seattle meeting.. Egtert
cuid Skinner have been close friends for
many years and the latter, ror a time had
an interest in Horatius. Skinner, how
ever, finally announced that he had dis
posed of his racing Interests. Egbert
says he has at no time been associated
with Skinner with the horses mentioned
in connection with the Seattle meeting.

Frank Gorgan, a newcomer in the fistio
game fought ten gory rounds with Frank
George and won because tha , latter shed
more blood than himself. It la true that
G organ spilled blood every round ; and
took a terrific beating, but his gameness
and willingness to battle won him the de
cision. Early in the fight Georga: landed
a right on Gorgan's eye , and j the blood
trickled down his cheek. George/ kept
playing for" the eye ' and before . many
rounds had been fought both' men were
red. The sight was sickening \u25a0 and many
spectators begged Referee :\u25a0 Shaughnessey
to ' stop the " bout, | but " Shaughnessey. re
fused, as Gorgan, despite the loss of
blood, was still full of fight In the tenth
round Gorgan bumped George v ; and :. the
blood flowed in quantity down George's
face. An artery must have been severed
as the gore rushed out and blinded the
fighter, but he fought on. It resembled . a
shambles and Captain of Police Anderson
started to enter the ring to stop, the .fight.
Referee . Shaughneesey ; saw him i coming
and sent George to lus corner, and gave
the contest to Gorgan. \ George 'certainly
had the better of the fight up to- the tenth
round and -might have: won, if he had es
caped the heavy right handers of his big
ger opponent. â¢

Poor Showing Made
'by Patched-Up
;J Commuters.
- Mr. Piarca from the buÂ»hesigave the
Seals a. start in the first inning. yesterday
that entitled them to the game :bef ore it
was half .over. Mr. Pierce did not seem
to know where the home plate waa lo
cated" and" after three men had* been
passed and one of them, had scored. Papa
Van Haltren ordered Pierce chased to the
bench -and Hogan trotted out.
: Hogan made an . awfully good start,
striking out Nealon. Hildebrand was
doubled up trying to go to third on the
play and everything gave promise . of a
rattling good ball game. But the prom
ise, did not come through, as the contest
dragged itself along and none of the play
ers seemed to care how it all ended.
] The Commuters began to , wade Into
HHt's offerings in the opening round and
it looked as though they would make a
bunch of runs and break up the game
without further ceremony. But the best
they got was a run' on three hits. Oscar
Graham brought that in with the bases
full when he was retired from short to
first, Francka beating the play at the
plate.
[ - Jimmy Byrnes and Buck Franeks had
i their wings working too strong and bad
I throws by them were responsible for two
:of the Seals' runs. With two down in the
second -Hitt, Spencer and Waldron all
blngled safely, bringing a run over In
jig time. Hildebrand scored -the last one
j for the day !^n the seventh wnen he got
; to second on Francks* wild peg; advanced
ito third when Irwiri sacrificed and ar
rived on NealonV long, fly toKruger.
JMohler was back in the game again and
his lame wing- seemed to. work as fast aa
of yore. He was on the end of one of the
fastest double", plays seen on the lot for
a long time.',' Kelly is laid up with a bad
finger, so the. Commuters had rather a
patched-up looking layout with Graham
jin left field and Dunleavy on second. The

S*ir York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. July 21. â^The extreme apathy
of to-day's stock market served to eliminate
another cf the explanations which have been
advanced from time to time to account for
the lethargic rut into which the trading has
fallen. It was supposed that the market was
\u25a0waiting for dtfinite news on dividends which
vtre confidently expected to be increased. The
most imj>ortant Of these were Union Pacific
&nd Amalgamated Copper, but the market
ebowed as little stimulation from those causes
to-day as when they were announced yester
day. The explanation of thia eeeming Indif
ference, of course. Is that the declrÂ«d buying
was accomplished before the dividend action
was actually announced. The action of to
day's market until the last half hour eeemed
to warrant the assumption that the discount-
Ing process bad been carried a step further
end that much of the distribution of holdings
to take profits had alno been duly perfected
before the event. Where the movement of
prices attained any Important Cimension was
In the list of usually inactive specialties. Out
â¢ side news was of little effect.
The large placing of foreign funds here dur
ing the week would operate to relieve the de
mand upon the New York loan account. The
offerings of foreign ! rands here came to A
pausf^o-fiay ana th*' foreign exchange market
ehr-wed a recovering tendency In consequence.
.The closing tone of stocks was decidedly

Futnre Grain and Provision".
- CHICAGO. July 21. â The wheat market was
extremely strong, throughout the entire ses
sion. Under urgent demand from ehorts . the
.opening.^ on the \u25a0 September option was *up
% to %C at 57% to SSc.' Black rust In the
wheat fields In Minnesota and the Dakota*
was the burden of numerous messages re
ceived here, not from Minnesota alone, but'
from all over the- Northwest. Fear- of a repe
tition of last year's devastation : in the spring
wheat territory was the sole reason, for the
general demand for wheat which started
prices in a. wild scurry upward. .AIL other
influences were apparently Ignored. As the
session advanced additional advices, were re
ceived telling of the spread. of the crop-in
fection. The fresh .. advices, gave more
specific .information, .than was -\ contained
in the 'review -dispatches. 1 I The result was
a' still more urgent demand for .-wheat. The
weather In the Northwest was reported, as.
favorable to . the . spread of the blight, raina.
having fallen in numerous-localities-through
out the-Dakotas. Excitement in. the,. pit was,
at white heat from start, to finish. Longs,
. with haridÃome profits in sight, were about
the only sellers. A sensational . advance of
nearly s,!x cents in the price of .the Septem

Potatoes* Onions and Vegetables.
* v There were some orders on the : market for
Potatoes for shipment to Puget Sound, but
buying for that purpose was not of sufficient
volume to relieve the market, which' remained
very weak,, with* supplies burdensome . ana a
good portion or the" day's arrivals were added
to the already heavy -i accumulation \u25a0on the
wharves. Some dealers were , trying to. get
an advance for Yellow Onions, .but there was
no business reported "above .previous prices.
Prices of vegetables showed considerable re
vision. ! Green Peas were scarce and hlcn and
.Tomatoes less plentiful and firmer. Occasional
sales of the latter were reported at $1 per
box. but .there was not : sufficient business at
that figure to Justify such a quotation. The
other vegetables were In good supply" and
generally weak. . â¢

Receipts of Poultry from domestic . points
continued large and fully 75 per cent of the
arrivals were small young Chickens, which
were difficult to dispose of even at round con

natter, Cheese and Ekss.
Dealers gave widely differing quotations for
Butter yesterday. - Those who had to buy to
supply their trade quoted higher than the
quotations below in order to make their profit
on the resale, but others who had plenty were
weak and trying to sell. There was no lack
Â§f Butter on the market, but it was unevenly
istrlbu ted. hence the difference In quotations.
Receipts were heavy, being 991 cases.
There was no further change In Cheese.
Stocks continued heavy and the demand slow.
- Eggs remained about as before quoted. Re
ceipts and stocks were ample far all current
needs. .
Receipts were 99,100 lbs Butter. 1133 cases

Decldnona and Citrtu Fruit n.
-The usual' Friday dullness prevailed in the
"market for fresh fruits, local trade being of a
light hand-to-mouth character because of the
unfavorable weather. Quite a Quantity .of
packed stock was sent | north on the Portland
steamer, but there, was not. enough movement
in . that direction to relieve the market to any
extent. Apricots In ! bulk did better tinder
decreased receipts, but there was no improve
ment in small . packages, which, continued to
arrive freely from various sections. The Apri
cot growers In Alameda County are drying the
bulk of their fruit and the crop In that sec
tion Is said to be pretty well gathered. Packed
Offerings of Plums, Prunes and Peaches re
mained weak under heavy supplies. Peaches
being the weakest description. The .'leading
canners were buying loose Plums at" the qtrota-
tlons and were . also purchasing freely of
Peaches, paying $25 per ton. for yellow Free
stones and $40@50 f Or . Clingstones. No. 1
Bartlett' Pears ruled firm In the open market,
there being very little stock offering. -.' The
lower grades were neglected by the regular
trade, but sold \u25a0 for canning - account 'at
$20^30 per .'ton. Cantaloupes , and Nutmeg
ilelona of good .quality were, steadier,
while Watermelons - and Graphs " | were In
clined to easiness. â¢ Nectarines .were offering
again, but met with slow. sal*, being mostly
poor. Figa were suddenly scarce and what
little stock was available sold readily at higher
prices. - The Apple market was In very poor
shape, with trashy stock steadily accumula
ting. Fancy Gravenstetns In 4-tiar boxes were
still quoted up to $1 25 per box. but that was
an extreme figure. In ' fact, the bulk of the
available supplies were selling at 50@75c per
box. Berries and Citrus goods stood about as
previously quoted.

cution Given at Trial ; of
Rudolph Schultze's Slayer
DEFENDANT ..TURNS PALE
Brother of the Victim Says
He Would Have Been Shot
Also but for Interference
Two witnesses testified strongly
against the defendant yesterday at the
trial of Gustave Scherf. charged with
the murder of Rudolph W. Schultze.
shipbuilder, on Fifth avenue South on
August 24, before a ury in Judge Law
lor's court. They were William P.
Schultze; brother of the murdered man,
and E. F. Shumacher. While they were
testifying the defendant changed color
several times. His aged mother, who
sat beside him with bowed head,
seemed deeply affected.
William F. Schultze testified that he
ran out of the shop with Rudolph to
save the dogs. He turned hiÃ attention
to the larger dog. while Rudolph ran
toward his daughter, Ethel, who had
her pet dog In her arms. "Witness saw
one of the pound men throw the net
over Rudolph's head, who was thrown
over some, planks. Witness saw the de
fendant stand up from his seat on the
wagon and pull somethihg out of his
pocket. Defendant said something and
Just then witness happened -to turn
round when he heard a shot. He looked
toward the wagon and saw the defend
ant putting, a revolver In his pocket.' '.
"I saw my brother lying on the
ground," continued the witness, "and
I ran toward him. I picked him up and
carried him to the steps of his house
and laid him down. I walked toward
the wagon and told the defendant that
he was a cowardly dog to shoot a man
like that, and the defendant pointed the
revolver at me and said with an oath
that if I moved another step he would
shoot me- One of the other pound men
yelled to the defendant: .'For. God's
sake, Gus, don't shoot them both' Then
the two other pound men Jumped in
the wagon and drove away."
vShumacher testified that he kept his
eyes on the defendant all . the time-
While Rudolph Schultze was trying to
get out of the net witness saw the der
fcr.dant stand up from "his. seat on the
wagon, pull a revolver oiit-of his pock
et, take deliberate aim at the strug
gling man and fire at him.-
Corporal George W. Russell of the
Police Department explained to tho
Jury a diagram of the scene of the
murder. Dr. L. D. Bacigalupi testified
as to- tlie result of the autopsy^on
Schultze's body. The trial will be re
sumed Monday morning.
The Chinese Exclusion nine-
- The ,6an Francisco News Letter this week
prints an interesting and able editorial con
cerning the Chinese exclusion act. The Newa,
Letter was the first paper having the courage
to discuss this subject, and has been rewarded
by the act of President Roosevelt In demand
ing fair play. The \u25a0 criticisms of Constance
Trevelyan are \u25a0 attracting considerable atten
tion. . ,An article by Thomas. B. Wilson on
"Polities- is an able essay on political science.
The regular departments of the News Letter
are unusually bright this week, and thn stories
and Epecial articles are quite Interesting. *

Rue de Folsom, Mrs. Mary. Carroll lives
downstairs in the same maison; Mr.-Des

It. Mrs." Carroll is from . Tipperary and
proud of it. That is why Mr. Desmond
has a shanty on the side of . his head that
he could very easily ; hang his hat : upon

honorable body that, owing to the ac
tions of the Union Labor party's county

end as far as the United Labor League is
concerned, and 'there will 'be no further

clare positively that the wage-earners

Mayor's conduct in recruiting a gang of

disgraceful in. the extreme. The league

til next July,, when' the company would
be prepared to furnish .machines that
could handle more than eight party
tickets. â¢
Frank Jordan, representing the
Standard Company, offered to loan 100
additional voting machines to the city,
but, the commission hesitated about ac
cepting the offer, aa Jordan said the
commission would be held responsible
in case of Â» any damage. It developed
that the offer was made to the Super
. visors' Finance Committee, which had
accepted the offer to loan the machines,
and .had cut down the budget appro
priation for elections by $16,000 on that
understanding. .
.-.The .commission: held . that . it should
have been consulted by Jfae Finance
Committee before action was taken on
the offer. Leffingwell said the offer
was ridiculous and "the Supervisors
had an immaculate gall to take it upon
themselves to Ignore t ho Election" Com
mission^ In ' making the arrangements."
'Jordan agreed -to telegraph to his com
pany. asking If It would agree to re
lieve the commission from 'all personal
liability and. look to the city for com
pensation in case the machines loaned
are ; : damaged. Jordan said the ma
chines would have to be Insured and
Leffingwell said the city made no pro
vision for Insuring any property. Com
missioner Voorsanger | urged the ac
ceptance of the offer, but It was agreed
