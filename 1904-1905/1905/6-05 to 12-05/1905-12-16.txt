Alleged Swindlers Drop
Out of Sight After
Conviction. :
Government Hopes to Secure
Them as Witnesses in
Oregon Case 3.
"WASHIKGTOX, Dec 15.â ThÂ© Depart
fnÂ«nt of Justice and the State of Oregon
pre much concerned regarding the where
abouts of S. A. D. Puter and Horace G.
McKinley, both of whom were convicted
In Portland in connection with the ex
tensive land frauds in Oregon. In their
cases sentence was deferred on condition
that tbey furnish the Government with
all the information possible concerning
others Involved in the land swindles. It
elso was agreed with them that if they
withheld nothing the other cases against
Them would not be pressed.
According to special Assistant Attorney
General Francis J. Heney of the Depart
ment of Justice, who is now in this city,
\u25a0they were needed particularly in the case
Â« gainst Representative Binger Hermann.
Hcney further says that through infor
mation imparted by them the Govern
ment would recover more than $700,000
v. orth of lands disposed of by the. various
parties to the alleged frauds. Since their
trial and conviction, however, Puter and
McKinley have been charged with being
implicated in the frauds in State school
land?, by which Eajstern bankers were
*wiTj<JlÂ«"d_out of thousands oÂ£. dollars. And,
that en account of these later indict
ments their apprehension is likewise de
eircd by the State authorities.
The last heard of either of the men was
about the middle of September. Puter
reported himself as being in Chicago, and '
McKinley sect word that he and his wife
were in Seattle. About that time the
c ase against Hermann was coming up
for trial, and Puter wired Heney asking
if he could not postpone the trial until
September 20. This was agreeable to the
Government's attorneys, who, however,
Jn the meantime had decided still further
to put off Hermann's trial. All trace of
the two men since has been lost.

SALEM. Dec. 15. â R. H. Goddard, son
t>f Hiram Goddard. banker and timber
jnan of La Crosse, Wis., arrived here
to-day from the East to make investi
gation of the numerous fraudulent cer
tificates of sale which his father holds
for Oregon school lands. Goddard
"brought with him certificates covering
7000 acres of land, nearly all the paper
being fraudulent. Goddard also lias
\u25a0with him .- certificates covering 7000
ecros- of land which S. A. de Puter,
bow a fugitive from justice, sold to H.
,\. Salzer o' La Crosse through a Chi
cago attorney for $IS,OOO. In a pre
vious transaction with Salzer the swin
clers obtained about $12,000. Just how
much of the fraudulent paper was pur
chased by Goddard and Salzer has not
been ascertained, but it is thought that
most of the paper now in Goddard's
ropsepsion is forged. R. H. Goddard
expressed great surprise when in
formed that Kay McKay, who was ar
rested in Seattle in connection with
the land frauds, had been released on
instructions from his father. Further
developments are expected within a few
days.

CONFESSION
AMAZES THE
SPECULATORS
Lawson's Story of
Heavy Losses
Doubted.
Many Believe Finan
cier Is Only Playing
a Deep Game.
Think He Is Forcing the
Oil Trust to Invest in
Amalgamated.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON, Dec. 15.â State street to-day
confessed Its amazement . at the public
announcement of Thomas W. Lawson that
every dollar of his private fortune is be
hind the bear campaign in Amalgamated,
the total amount of his own and his
friends' money involved being $15,000,000.
One-third of this great sum Lawson put
into the pool within the last few days, and
he admitted Thursday night losses of $3,
400.000. The Lawson pool is said to be
short 170,000 Bhares of Amalgamated, and
if this is true the losses would amount
to-night to about $3,453,000. What the
street cannot understand is why Lawson
should advertise his impending bank
ruptcy if there is any danger of his finan
cial collapse, and those who think they
know his methods are . extremely skep
tical.
Opinion is divided as to Lawson's deals
of to-day, and many think he saw a
chance to execute a quick turn, and that
instead of sustaining a further loss to
his pool hec leaned up a tidy sum. These
observers call attention to the fact tha"t
wnife- Lawson -arfwxtiset...* loss of :"3,40Cr,-.
000, he makes no mention of his profits in
Amalgamated and other coppers. A care
ful" reading- of \u25a0 Lawson's announcement
regarding' his Amalgamated pool shows
some important things. A rise of about
twenty points has cost the pool $3,400,0d0.
according to Lawson. He says he still
has $11,000,000 left. It will jrequire a rise
of nearly seventy points to*wipe out this
sum. When Amalgamated sells at 170
State street and Lawson's close friends
will believe he is broke, and not before
that time. ...
One significant fact came out to-day
which is believed by many to point to the
meat in the Lawson cocoanut. A Boston
banking firm which six months ago was
carrying many thousand shares of Amal
gamated for itself and its customers to
day had less than 2000 shares in its safe,
the balance having gone to New York.
The deduction from this is that Lawson
has for weeks been compelling Standard
Oil to load up with Amalgamated in sus
taining the advance in its price. This i 3
thought to be just what Lawson wants.
He has repeatedly said that the only way
for people to get even with the "system"
is to compel it to buy its own stocks at
higher prices than it sold them for.
ADVANCE IX AMALGAMATED.
Report That the American Smelting
Company Is Heavy Purchaser.
BOSTON, Dec. 15. â A story is cur
rent on "the street" that the Amer
ican Smelting and Refining Company
has secured control of Amalga
mated and United Copper through
heavy purchases of stock in the open
market. A controlling, ownership in
these ' two concerns would make the
smelting company the leading factor
in the copper world. The Helnze propo
sition, through the acquisition of the
Lexington group, which will be in
operation next month, is destined to be
as big a one as the Amalgamated, as ex
perts believe the ore bodies are a con
tinuation of the North Butte's rich
veins and predict that they will prove
the richest in the Butte camp.

Railway King Tells of
Political Power at -
Says He Gave ; OdeU His High
. Standing and Takes Rap
at^Ryan.
â¢ â y
NEW YORK, Dec 16.â Before the leg
islative investigating committee" another
chapter was added to-day to the 1 chrdni-'
cles 'of what Thomas A. Ryan called
"strenuous" interviews "between himself
and E. H. Harriman. Ryan ' gave * his
version of the conversations to the com
mittee a few days ago when he said that
Harriman, at the time of the acquisition
of the James H. .Hyde stock in the
EaultabJe Life Insurance Company, de
manded an equal share and "threatened \u25a0
to use his political influenoe against Ryan
if he did not surrender It. -To-day Har-"
rlman ' recited to the committee his ver
sion and added some- interesting state"
ments affecting his relations with former
Governor B. B. Odell Jr., chairman of the
New York State. Republican Committee,
and also as to a request to watch legis
lation affecting the Equitable Society
which he had made' upon Governor
Francis W. Higglns and the late S.F red
Nixon,;, Speaker .of 4 the New York ,â A
ssembly. . \u0084" . .'.'.
. . In substance Harriraan. testified .to-day
' that. rwhenj Ryan bought: the .Hyde" stock;*
carrying control Tof the -KQuitable Society,"?
he asked. Harrlirian:' to co-operate*"* with'
him in saving the " property ,â¢ that} HarrtV
man\ agreed to -do it if satlsfled ~ that
I Ryan was acting from pure and "unselfish
motives; that Ryan did not satisfy him
as to the" purity of his motives, and that
Harriman then informed - Ryan that he
would use his influence agf'nst him. The
test which Harriman said ac applied to
determine Ryan's purity of motive was
an offer to take one-half of- the Hyde
stock and to name * two trustees of the
society. Ryan refused to agree to that.
Harriman' testified that Ryan should
have assumed that he would use his po
litical influence against him. ""â¢ He was
not certain whether he said anything
about legislative action as a warning to
Ryan, but declared that he had nothing
to do with starting the present insurance
investigation.
HIS POLITICAL FRIEXDS.
Charles E. Hughes, counsel for the
committee, informed Harriman that it
has been charged that he got his.politi
cal influence through his relation with
former Governor 8.J3. Odell. Jr. . .
Harriman said: "Well, I should, think
Mr. Odell had his .political influence **e
cause of his relation with me." Laughter
followed the remark. Later Harriman
said to the Dress that- .the remark was
meant in a Jocular sense.
â¢ LastgSprlng, Harriman said, /when the
management of the Equitable Life As-^
surance Society, was divided into two fac
tions, one headed by President James ."W."
Alexander and. the other by James H.
Hyde, an attempt was made by ; the Alex
ander \u25a0 faction to induce the Legislature
to mutualize the society. Harriman said
he asked members of the Legislature to
watch out for any legislation favorable
to the Alexander faction and to report
to hiny If It appeared.
. He was averse, to disclosing, the names
of the men to whom he made this re
quest, and only consented to do bo after
repeated urging. He then stated that it
was Governor , Higglns ' and Speaker
Nixon. whom he had. asked to watch out
for the legislation. ' He added that, no
suoh legislation was introduced and that
he took no steps through Governor Hlg
glnÂ« and Speaker Nixon to prevent it
<lU ESTI OX S RYAN'S MOTIVES.
Harriman "was called to the stand, when
the insurance . Investigating: committee
opened' its session to-day. He i said. he
learned of the sale of the Hyde stock on
the day that Ryan bought it. He tele
phoned to Ryan and asked him if he had
\u25a0bought' it. /. ' â¢\u25a0- : ' " :- :yi<, \u25a0\u25a0'\u25a0\u25a0.
"Ryan said the purohase \u25a0\u25a0 was . condi

wanted ito see me and talk . with â¢; me and
that he wanted my /help.- I criticized his
plan and wanted to know what he meant
by it. Ten or fifteen minutes later I went
to Ryan's office.- He told ma he had de
cided "to buy the " stock and said it was
time for 'him to make: a' name' for himself.
He said he ; bad .'decided to â¢ buy Hyde's
stock* provided- he: could get his nominee

he had made a 'good deal of â¢ money and
never had done anything to make a name

"The next interview with Ryan wa*
on the Monday following the purchase
of the Hyde stock," sakl the witness.
"First, however, I told Mr. Ryan I had
helped to elect President Morton, and
Ryan said he wanted to meet me, and
after Morton was elected Ryan called
me uj- and said he appreciated my help
and wanted me to continue, and said he
would do nothing: further \u25a0without my
consent. I made an appointment to

said Ryan was sorry he had to, proceed
without me, I told Mr. Cravatti I con
bidered this an act of bad faith, turned
itiy back on Cravath and walked away.
Mr. Ryan later asked me to his office
on Monday to meet Mr. Hoot.
"In that interview with Cravath he
told me that Mr. Root had Insisted on
the appointment of the trustees of the
Kquitable at once and. the announce
ment in the morning papers. That was
the first intimation that Mr. Ryan had
asked the trustees to act. I want you
all to understand that I have something
besides life insurance to do and think
of. My mind was on the 25,000 miles
cf railroads and 35 to 40 steamships
which I have to think of. I wanted
only to safeguard the Equitable. Mr.
Ryan did not tell me at the first in
terview what he had paid for the Hyde
stock.
"At the next interview Root and Cra
vath were present. I said to Ryan: 'You
want my co-operation?* He said: 'Yes.'
I eaid: "I will take half of your stock
provided you will agree to the appoint
ment of two additional trustees who will
be absolutely independent.' Ryan refused
and told me I had promised to help him
if I was satisfied. 1 said this was my
way of beins satisfied. I do not remem
ber what else I said. I may have said
what yiese eentlemen say 1 did. I -in
tended,' unless 1 was satisfied of his mo
tives, to oppose his control of the society
and thought it ought to be. stopped. I
knew whom he had selected as trustees,
but did not know his plan to divest him
self of control of the stock."
"Why did you object?" asked Hughes.'
"I wanted two trustees independent, of
Mr. Ryan. I think that any trustees
named as Ryan named them must be to
a certain extent under his control, espe
cially as he had named a man out of his
own organization as president. I did not
demand a right to name two trustees,
but merely that they should be inde
pendent of Ryan. I offered to turn my
stock over to the society If air did. I
don't tee why he should not make the
trustees number a hundred, if his mo
tives were . pure. I was not a philan
thropist and did not consider It such for
him to pay $2,500,000* which he was going
to gel back when he got control of the
society. It was because of ray interest
in the Equitable that I warded a share.
There was no possibility of a panic. No
one but Ryan had sucti a view. I doubt
whether he had it."

"Did you tell Ryan if he did not give
you a share of the stock you would op
pose whatever he did?" asked Hughes.
"No, sir. A wrong interpretation has
been put on what came out of this. I
have no recollection of having said so to
Ryan. I did not intend to let anybody
control that stock unless I had a share
in it. I cannot say positively that I did
not say it."
"Did you tell him he would have your
help if he gave you a share?"
'T made no demand for the stock, but
insisted that he should satisfy me of the
purity of his motives, which he could do
by giving me a share.*'
"Did you tell him he could not succeed
without your help?"

center the . control of the Equitable in
himself and I told him that my influence
would be thrown against him. I told him
I would use every effort I could; It was

EXECUTION INEEBRFMIY
Condemned Murderer Loses
His Self-Control When He
Learns Last Hope Is Gone
CHICAGO, Dec. 15.â The Supreme Court
of the State to-day affirmed the verdict
of the lower court which condemned Jo
hann Hoch to death for the murder of
his.wif*. Mrs. Marie Weleker-Hoch, and
the date of his execution has been set for
February 23. . .â¢', ;
A messenger was sent to Hoch with
the* news and found him in the visitors'
cage of the jail talking- with the last ot
his many wives, Mrs. Fischer-Hoch, the
sister of the woman for whose murder he
was sentenced to death. \Vhen he received
the news Hoch became ' greatly excited,
and pressing his face against the wire
netting he shouted:' "You are *a liar, a
liar. It is not true. I do not believe it."
He quickly became more composed and
asked for a verification of the report.
When the messenger came back a second
time Hoch took it very quietly. He did
not betray the slightest emotion and said
in his ordinary tone: "I have nothing to
sayâ nothing at all. If it must comt,
then it must. I have nothing more to
say."
The specific charge against Hoch and
on which he was convicted was the. kill
ing of his wife by the administration of
arsenic. He fled from the city and was
arrested In New York and brought back
to Chicago. He was placed on trial on
April 19 and convicted on May 20. Sen
tence of death was passed on him June S,
the date of June 23 being set for his exe
cution. ; \u25a0-\u25a0\u25a0:'.-'-\u25a0\u25a0--\u25a0-:*- . \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0!>. .- -: â¢ â¢
Governor Deneen granted him a re

granted . him a supersedeas to allow of
the consideration of his case. Th,e action
of the court to-day destroys his last hope
unless Governor Deneen interferes.
Hoch has always denied that he. killed
his wife by arsenic or otherwise. He has
admitted that he committed bigamy re

has who has never asked anything im

seems to be beyond question that bloody
collisions have occurred between troops
dnd the united peasantry and workmen in
the streets of Riga, during which machine
guns were used. The situation is most se
rious in the -country, which is practically
abandoned to the revolutionary bands
owing to the concentration of the troops
in the cities and towns. Against some of
the estates where the landlords, aided by
a few faithful adherents, are attempting
to > protect their property the revolution
ists are conducting regular military op
erations. They reduced the garrison of
the estate of Baron yon Loewis to sub
mission after a majority of the defenders
had been killed, and plundered and
burned the buildings and carried off the
Baron, . The . survivors were made pris
oners." .
The reports from the provinces indicate
that the country generally remains close
to the boiling point.. The situation' in the
Caucasus is again serious. The Tartars
and Armenians- are murdering each other
as of yore. At Ellzabethpol there has
been a savage exhibition of race /hatred.

of the' establishment of a republic there.
He says the military forces have gone

\u25a0 A private and reliable report from Mos

In a short speech his Majesty said he

that which he had' traced In his mani

Should Be; Sent to] Jail
\u0084 WASHINGTON, Dep. .15.â The -House
to-day devoted 'four and ' threV-quarter
hours jto " a'.jjllv'ely debate on. the possibil
ities' of ;= controlling insurance companies.
Two set speeches were the features. V One,
by SherleyV at' Kentucky, was based on
the doctrine ; of State's rigfits, arid:the
other, by; Cpckran: of New. York, related
to the actions of the officers who manage
the big life l.ir:surance companies ' his
State, | Cockran proposing j that Congress
through'its, taxing power should confine
all insurance . companies to the State in
which , they' are organized. '
Cockran made a vigorous attack on the,
officers of the three big life insurance
companies of New York. i*e denounced
the system* under -which the companies
had grown; up and was appalled thatthe
confessions' 'of the officers of the com*
panics had not landed them in . jail.
Cockran maintained that the power of
legislation . was a legitimate weapon* for
the control "of privileges and of "com
merce. \u0084 The reason the Senate was stead
ily increasing in power, he said, was be
cause 'It . constantly exercised - every
vestige of its power. Emphasizing the re
lations of ..the ; two houses, 'he-.. asserted
that powers unused would decay and that
the House-, now -"possessed ' all \u25a0 the power
necessary , to establish its predominance. -
TAKES SHOT AT RYAN.
"There is- not the need-, of .paying a
salary of $150,000 "a" year by an' insurance
company, to protect Its policy holders,"
said; Cockran, "but it is necessary . to get
a man to swindle them."
It was an awful spectable, he said, to
see these men mount; the' .witness stand
and boldly confess their misuse of the
people's funds. / Tfiere Is j now the spec
tacle in New. York, he sald.-O'f the Dis
trict Attorney working day and night
to prosecute: those guilty, of violating the
purity of. the ballot box, which was com
mendable^ â¢ But at the same. time the in
surance officials did not go to Jail, but
back to their, offices alter their confes
sions. \u25a0 He said it was a deplorable con
fession.''to make, but he would, assert
that It would ,be absolutely -Impossible
to put the possessor of $1,000,000 in 'Jail In
,this country... '
"The Equitable company was organized
on a' 'somewhat peculiar basis," he con
tinued. A very rich gentleman whom we
all have the';' right, I suppose, to call a
philanthropistâ for he himself has said it,
and it is greatly to his credit (laughter)â
purchased the control of this company
giving $2,500,000 for stuff that can pay him
but $3500 a., year. That is to say through
his philanthropy he has given an earn
ings power;jpf $125,000 ' f or^ $3500. ,He is too
good a business man to have done that as
a matter of course. There is no explana
tion for/ , it, except philanthropy
(laughter);* '
REFERS TO CLEVELAND.
; "Now,, in .order, to appease the popular
mind on the. philanthropic enterprise what
has he done? Has he gone to the insur
ance world to find this talent that Is
worth $150,000 a year or $75,000 tt year?
By no means. â¢, He has gone outside. and
appointed .'a king of a; financial vigilance
committee; and not one of the vigilantes
has ever had anything to do with an In
surance company except that possibly one
of them may have borrowed money from
it. A, -very eminent statesman, one of
the most illustrious of our time, has been
called from the classic shades of Prince
ton, where he has been spending the de
cline of an illustrious life In composing
philosophical contributions to the thought
of the country, and placed In the chair of
an Insurance company with which, so far
as I know, he has never had the slightest
acquaintance whatever..
'^"Another gentleman, who may. have
borrowed money from an insurance com
pany,: but certainly never had anything
tojio with the administration of one him
self, a' financier of no mean distinction. Is
associated with him. And the third is
a Judge, an eminent kludge, a/ Judge
whose motives nobody will ever question,
but who In taking on this peculiar func
tion of a vigilante has been compelled to*
disqualify himself from sitting in a great
number of cases which the State of New
York had expected him to adjudicate.
V "And : In order to make, effective this re
form ; a gentleman Is selected | who may
have beeji a good railroad manâ l believe
he wasâ and we have the authority of the
President for it, he who was an excellent

In the walks of life where he had proven
his efficiency. I do not believe could com
mand more than $25,000 or $30,000 a year,

WAR ON REBATES
ON IN MISSOURI
Fourteen Indictments Are
Returned Against Railway
Companies and Shippers
PACKEKS ABE INCLUDED
Concessions Alleged to Have
Been Made to Business
Eirms > by, the Carriers
"KANSAS CITY," Mo., Dec/ 15.â Fourteen
indictments were returned by the Federal
Grand Jury here to-day against common
carriers, | railroad j officials, shippers and
freight agents, charging .the giving of
rebates and conspiracy- to gain rebates.
The fourteen indictments were returned,
as follows: George H. Crosby of Chicago,
general traffic, manager of the Chicago,
Burlington and Qulncy Railroad; Geo. I>.
Thomas; broker, of 320 â¢ Broadway, New
York; L.-B. Taggart, New York, Crosby's
chief clerk; the Chicago and Alton Rail
road Company and John N. Falthorn and
F." A. "Warm, f ormerlyi viee 1 " president and
general freight agent, respectively, of the
railroad company: the Cudahy Packing
Company; Swift Co.; the Armour
Packing Company; the Chicago, Mil
waukee and St. Paul Railroad Company;
Nelson .Morris, Edward Morris and Ira
N. Morris, comprising the partnership of
Nelson Morris & Co; D. H. Kresky, Kan
sas City, freight broker.
The charges 'against the Chicago and
Alton and Messrs. Falthorn and Warm
are identical with those made in the in
dictments returned by the Federal Grand
Jury at Chicago on December 14.
The indictments- against the packing
companies charge that Hhey entered into
a contract with the Burlington Railway
to acceDt concessions on shipments of
their_ products -from East St. I*mis to
New York for export. The Grand Jury
charges that the agreement thus entered
into provided for a rate of 23 cents a
hundred' pounds on these products. This
was in. July,. 1905. -The agreement was to
continue in force until January 1, 1906.
The .local rates applied on these ship
ments between Kansas City and St.
Louis. '
In August, 1905, the joint rate on pack
ing-house products was raised by the
joint traffic association to 35 cents be
tween East St.. Louis and New York.
The Burlington, nevertheless, it is de
clared, lived up to its 23 cent agreement
with the packers in Kansas City and
under which agreement it practically
carried all the packing-house products
from this city except those of the
Schwarschild & Sulberger Packing Com
pany.
Two Indictments were returned against
George 1* Thomas of New York, who is
alleged to have had a contract with the
Burlington, by the terms of which he was
to receive a j certain percentage of the
freight rates paid on all shipments more
than a specified tonnage from New York
to Kansas City and vice versa. The in
vestigation made by the Grand Jury re
vealed the fact that Thomas had agencies
at Kansas City, . Omaha, Chicago, St.
Louis, Atchlson. Milwaukee and other
cities.
The specific charge against the Chicago,
Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway is that
of granting a rebate . of . seven cents a
hundred pounds to the "Howard Mills
Company of Wichita, Kan., on a ship
ment of flour from Kansas City to New
York. X
CHICAGO," Dec. 15.â 1n an interview
here to-night regarding the Indictments
returned by the Federal tourt at Kansas
City J. Ogden Armour, head of the Ar
mour Packing Company, said:
. I understand thÂ« charges relate - entirely to
shipments from Kansas City to Europe. In
each case the packers have paid the full rate
established by 'the railroad on such ship
ments. This rate was open to anybody mak
ing such shipments, and there was not any
rebate., concession or discrimination whatever
to the shipper in respect of this transaction.
It has lons been a question between the
Interstate Commerce Commission and the rail
roads, whether the transportation of property
from Interior cities of the United States upon
a through rate over railroads and ocean steam
ships to foreign countries is within the pro
visions oC the Interstate Commerce act or the
jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Com
mission. I â¢ understand that the Burlington
Railroad has consistently maintained th 3 posi
tion that it is not and so has refused to file
such tariffs with the . Interstate Commerce
Commission. So far aa I can see, the ques
tion raised by these indictments Is whether
the railroads are required to file with the
Interstate Commerce Commission and publish
the through tariff on such through shipments
to Europe. "With that question, the shippers,
like the packers here, would have no control

HOLIDAY TRADE
AT HIGH MARK
detail Sales Surpass All Kec
ords and Supplementary
Orders Are Coming In
STAPLES ARE L\ DE3LVND
Eaihvay Earnings Steadily
Show Gains Over Figures
â¢ for December Last Year
NEW YORK, Dec. 13.â Dun's weekly
review of trade will say to-morrow:
Holiday trade has been the principal
feature commercially, retail sales sur
passing all records, while it ha 3 been nec
essary to liberally supplement orders.
Yet this activity in specialties detracts
little from the steady movement of
staples, and in jobbing and manufactur
ing departments there is unprecedented
preparation for the spring season. Little
machinery is tdle, and the outlook for the
future is brightened by several announce
ments of higher wage scales to become
effective January, 1. Building activities
are scarcely retarded by the advancing
season, new points being constantly
granted and dealers in some materials
find their stocks nearins exhaustion.
Railway earnings steadily show gains
over last year's figures for December
thus far exceeding those of 1904 by 4.4
per cent. Foreign commerce returns for
November made a much better exhibit
as to exports than was expected partly
because of the outgo of breadstuffs,
which surpassed all monthly records for
two years. At thi3 port for the past week
all exports were valued at $3,424,342 mora
than a year ago. while Import* decreased
$1,406,099. ,
Hides are remarkably well sustained,
considering the seasonable deterioration
in quality and the liberal receipts of
cattle.
Failures this week number 239 in the
United States against' 256 last year, and 27
; in Canada compared with 23 a year ago.
Bradstreet's to-morrow will say:
Holiday trade 'has absorbed attention
this week and reports from all over the
country are unanimous that all records
for this stage of the season have beea
surpassed. * -
In raw - wool buying Is moderate but
prices are strong and about at a par
with last year at this time. Much depends
on the coming heavyweight season. The
, lightweight season showed demand most
active for worsteds. If, as is hoped,
woolens find . flavor, shorter clothing
wools, which are in elaborate supply,
will be stimulated.

HOW YOUNG MAN DIED.
At the Coroner's inquest in the John Rush Baird case yesterday the conspicuous figure was Miss
Ruth Brown Neil, who had been Baird's companion and fiancee. The funeral was held from the
family residence, 2513 Pacific avenue. Though Miss Neil was not welcome at the funeral, she
went to the cemetery after the interment and sorrowed alone at the tomb.
Miss Neil Proves
Chief Figure at
Inquest
Sobs and Says She
Tried to Save
Fiance. â¢
The Coroner* Jury held its Inquest over
the body of John Rush Eaird yesterday
eftemoon and oecided that he met his
dcatU by the accidental turning over of
Â£U e.utomobi'e which he was attempting
to guide d"wn the hill near the Corbett
road on Tuesday night. No blame was
lidd against any one. although Coroner
Iceland and the jury probed every wit
ness to Snd out whether any of the facts
of the accident had been hidden from
the public. The machine evidently turned
over through a break in the steering
gear.
The little jury-room at the Morgue was
crowded with the curious, who were anx
ious to see Mi?s Ruth Brown Neil, the
companion of Baird on that fataf night,
the girl to whom lie had been secretly
<>:i!caged for months. She was.
of course, the" star witness of the morn
ing, and the onlookers listened to her
every word with hushed breath. There
vas something dramatic about her ap
pearance. She wore a gray dressed topped
with a gTay coat of the same material
reaching almost to her ankles. Her hat
tvas black and her face was covered with
Â£ light pray veil. Her eyes showed the
fearful strain she had been undergoing
e'.nre the death of the man she loved, but
DO amount of sorrow could mar the beau
ty cf h^r features.
Quietly and simply she told her story.
J\rr voice was a triflo broken by her ef
fort? to keep calm while she recited the
entails of the wreck. She faced the jury
most of the time, turning now and then
toward Coroner Lelar.d, who was ques
tioning her.
TELLS OF ACCIDENT.
There was not much that was new in
her story- She told how she and Baird
had gone to San Mateo in the afternoon
to sret the automobile from the repair
shop, where it had been left since it got
out of order on the day of the Stanford-
California football game at Palo Alto; of
the trip back to town, and how the ma
chine behaved badly most of the time;
of their ride down the brach, their at
tempt to climb the hill just off Corbett
road, the breaking Gf the speed lever and
the stop by the roadside; of her climb
in? out of the machine, her attempt to |
tiart it by pushing, and finally its sudden
rush" ahead up the bank until its equilib
rium watt lost, and then the fearful upset,
\u25a0which pinioned Baird beneath the weight j
of the powerful machine.
She told how she ran to him and called
his name, then kicked out the lights as
hÂ«Â» directed: how s!ie cried out when she )
tid not ep^ak to her ajrain and madly 3
c -ized his hand to know by its warmth j
that he etill lived. It seemed like the j
I Uying of some terrible tragedy. With !
this li*-year-cld girl as the cast, the on
'\u25a0â¢\u25a0jkers being the audience, as she told of
her frantic run down an unknown road
i Tying aloud for help; yet this was no bit
<\u25a0 f acting. The girl was telling the trag
edy of her life. Every man in the room
pitied her.
John Gomereol, a plumber, living at 421.
Corbett road, told the jury how he had j
Been the girl running down the road and
h*>&rd her cry for help. He ran to her 1
and helped extricate the dead man. He
told hew Miss Neil kept crying that

automobile. John S. Partridge appeared
for the Baird estate, but asked no ques
tions.
The verdict was given about noontime
yesterday. Miss 'Neil walked away with
Percy Pike, manager of the Federal Can
Company, a friend of the dead clubman.

IN LANE CASE
Objections to Selection of
Califoriiiaii on Interstate
Board Will Be Presented
WASHINGTON. Dec. 15.â The Senate
Committee on Interstate Commerce to
day considered the nomination of
Franklin Lane of California to be a
member of the Interstate Commerce
Commission. It was known to members
of the committee that there was opposi
tion to tho confirmation of Lane, and
therefore it was referred to a sub-com
mittee, which will hear all objections
and report to the full committee.
formal protest against the nom
ination has been made, although it has
been declared by certain Pacific Coast
Senators that they believe that the ap
pointment should have been given to a
RepubUcan. The same view is held ,by
many Eastern Senators, and it is pre
dicted that the nomination may be held
up for some time. It was stated to
day that Senator. Cullom desired that
no action be taken until he could con

TILLMAN GRILLS
ADMINISTRATION
Severely Criticizes Methods
of President in the Santo
Domingo and Canal Affairs
HE ALLEGES TRICKERY
Senator Asserts That Kaiser-
Like Ways Have Been Im
ported From Philippines
WASHINGTON. Dec. Qs.â The Panama
canal was again under consideration by
the Senate to-day, and Ttllman occupied
the most of the time given to that sub
ject, except when he gave way to ques
tions or interruptions by other Senators.
He did not Indicate "any intention of op
position to the passage of the'appropria
tion bill, but he criticised the methods of
the Canal Commission in many of its
transactions.
He raised the question as to whether
President Shonts is still In the employ of
the Clover I/eaf Railroad, and said that
the railway register still carried his name
as the head of that road. He also sharply
criticised the | employment* 'of Secretary
Bishop as a press representative, and
Hale joined in this censure, saying thai
Bishop's employment in- that* capacity is
a reflection not only on Congress, but on
the press.
A part of Tillman's remarks was de
voted to a criticism of the President's
policy in Santo Domingo, and Spooner de
fended the President's course.
CALLS IT TRICKERY.
Spooner declared that the President has
not done anything to carry the unratifled
treaty into effect and insisted upon THI
man specifying anything. In reply, Till
man reiterated that our fleet was kept
in Dominican waters. He said that
Spooner was a supple acrobat in the use
of words.
"Is not our present attitude the same
as it would be if the. treaty had been
ratified?" asked Tlllman, and Spooner
replied: "Not at all," adding that If the
treaty had been ratified the United
States would have its own revenue agents
In Santo Domingo,, whereas the present
agents were the result of appointment by
President Morales.
"Who suggested their " appointment?"
Tillman a*ked, and Spooner replied that
the President of the United States had
done so. Tillman contended that this ad
mission justified all that he said.
"It is beating about the .bush; the ac
complishment of what is wanted by trick
ery. It is play on words, to justify the
usurpation." he paid.
Spooner insisted that there had been
no ' trickery and defended the action of
the President. Trickery was not a nice
thing to imDUte. he said, and Tillman in
terrupted to say that "when a man ac
complishes by unlawful methods what he
cannot otherwise accomplish I call It
trickery."
Spooner responded that the term was
"nasty and undignified and should not be
used in speaking of the head of a jeo-or
ordinate branch of the Government."
Tillmanâ "Let the Senator suggest a
better one then." ,
Spooner â "The Senator's whole idea is
so wrong that it cannot bo made right-"
Tlllman then asked what exense the
President had for not entirely wlthdnrw
ing from Santo Domlngd and leaving the
situation alone, and Spooner replied that
the Senate should not have adjourned
without acting on the treaty as to rati
fying or rejecting it, as the failure had
had the effect of leavlne the President in
a position of embarrassment. It was the
duty of Santo Domingo to maintain the
status quo to the end of preventing the
seizure of '.her custom-houses or the
segregation of her revenues.
Money spoke disparagingly of the Presi
dent's disposition to participate in the af
fairs of Santo Domingo without the con
sent of Congress..
" 'Walk softly, carry a big stick and
you will go far.' says the President."
said Money, "and I interpret this expres
sion to mean that the' President means
to walk softly in dealing with the big na
tions, and to use the big stick in 1 dealing
with the weak when he sets asidr, the
law of thd land and substitutes for It his
own judgment."
"KAISEU-LIKE METHODS."
A resolution by Carmack instructing the
Senate Committee on Naval Affairs to in
quire into reports of brutality practiced
by hazers upon students at the Naval
Academy of Annapolis, with a view to
putting a stop to such practices, was
adopted.
Proceeding to discuss the adverse criti
cism of the Panama Railroad manage
ment. | Tillman provoked . protests from
Galllnger and Allison, the former calling
attention to preparations to double track
the railroad to relieve the blockade and
the latter saying that more than half of
the money to be appropriated in the pend
ing bill is to be used for improvements to
the railroad and wharves.
Tillman asserted that the issuance of
bonds by the Panama Railroad is-illegal,
declaring it amounted to an issue of
bonds by the Panama Canal Commission.
He declared that the whole thing was a
"hocus pocus" and that the railroad and
Panama Canal Commission are one so far
as ths actual conditions are concerned.
"Technically." said Tlllman, "I sup
pose they were all right. Technically
Taft was a king in the Philippines, but
we are degenerating far away from a
self-governing people in our management
of these affairs. I think I shall use a
former phrase of mine, that Kaiser-like
methods have been imported frem the
Philippines. Of course Taft has been
used to having his own way."
Tillman argued finally that Congress
should say whether this debt should be
created. He thought the money was
needed but said he did not like the way
it was being obtained. He protested
against what he called" a Dominican or
Morales way of doing business, declared
the whole procedure to have been a
usurpation of power. Tlllman nad read
a newspaper publication alleging importa
tion into the canal zone of women from
Martinique for immoral purposes, that
the Government ship had been used and
that canal officials in the zone had sanc
tioned the transaction. Lodge interrupt
ed to; say that he had considered the
charge that a Government â¢ vessel â¢",. had
been used "a matter so monstrous" that
he had talked over the telephone with
the Secretary of War and that official
had authorized him to say "that the
charge was ! a lie."
Tlllman replied that he would be will
ing to accept the Secretary's statement
concerning a case in regard to which he
has personal information, Dut. as : he, has
no such information In this 'case, he
thought there should be an investigation.
When the I Senate -adjourned the canal
bill was . still pending, ? but \ there was an
agreement for a vote ' to-morrow. - â¢

the immigration officers Is strengthened,
making It absolutely the duty of the
masters of vessels to prevent such land-
Ing. Exceptions are made In the cases

opened at the Insular Bureau of the
War Department to-day for concession
ary grants to be made by the Philip
pine Government for the construction,
maintenance and operation of railroads
in the Philippine Islands, as provided
by act of Congress.
"Among other bids, Morris McMicken.
G. Gresskens, G. Poncln, Jacob Furth
and E. C.Hughes of Seattle offered to
build 100 miles of railway in Southern
Luzon, designated in the circular as
larid Xo. 6, under a 4 per cent guar

of the cost of construction. They

length of about 1333 miles. Lines are
to be constructed on the islands of
Luzon, Panay, Negros, Cebu, Leyte and
Samar. ,
The railroad lines to be constructed
are to be post routes and military
roads, subject to the use of the Philip

Philippines. This shows a decided in
crease above previous years.
The value of sugar imported from
Cuba this year is also far higher than
the value of the amount Imported last
year, though the quantity was about
300.000 pounds less. In previous j^ars

PALACE IS GAY
WITH FRIDAY
NIGHT DANCES
SALLY SHARP
Say what you will about personality as ;
an asset, It Is nowhere more needful than i
in a social leaderâ so thought a dozen of
us at last night's /ball at the Palace,
where Mrs. Ynez Shorb WhitÂ© was sover
eign over a triple hundred of men, maids
â¢irjd matrons.
Personality and tactâ this tails tha tale
of the popularity of tha new leader and
her dances, .and the popularity of both is ;
no longer debatable.
Though the second of the winter's se
ries of ballsâ end sandwiched in twlxt a
Ecore cf othersâ the ball laet night was
gay, crisply smart, and as pretty to look
upon ac a tote garden In June.
True, there were few decorationsâ tout
what need for soulless flowers with such :
a garden cf American beauties, quick with j
life and allurement?
As the former Friday Xlght Cotillon,
the dance was an early affairâ that is,
mostly.
Of course, there are always a coterie of ,
guestsâ mostly men, who prefer dining to
dancingâ defer arriving until nigh to sup
per hour.
Not good form?
Perhaps not, but there are a few young
men hereabouts who assert that thus pop
ularity and position permit them social
libertiesâ that they are needed, really
needed, end the dear girls and the host
esses dare not complain.
Sweet things, these! Good dancing men,
but bad timber for husbands.
A stunning lot of cirls danced at the

CLEVER AMATEURS ARE TO ESSAY
INTERPRETATION OF MASTER.
"MERCHANT OF VENICE" WILL FACK -MAJESTIC -MONDAY .-NIGHT
SALLY SHARP
Last week George Ade was the man.
This week It's William Shakespeare, the
good old reliable. And it all came about
through the appeal of the Doctor's
Daughters and the response from a lot
of good people who wanted to help, with
just a little fun thrown in for embellish
ment.
And now the fun is onâ such fun as a
lot of intensely earnest and intensely clev
er folk get out of planning a play, study
ing it, rehearsing it, costuming it andâ
quibbling over it.
And now, at the Seventh hour, it's all
over but. the performance. And Monday
night will bring that, while the town is
a-quiver with expectancy.
Of course you have your seats.
If not, then lose not another golden mo
ment.
And if the seats that are left don't suit
you then get them for the matinee on
Tuesday, for that, it is thought by some
prophets, will be the -smoother perform
ance by virtue of the overnight produc
tion:
As a matter of fact, however, Richard
Mansfield had not a smoother rehearsal
when he came to town than that which
joyed in the ears of Richard Hotaling
yesterday at dress rehearsal.
The followingâ each one intelligently
cast and none better than Dick Hotaling
in Shylock, as you will seeâ is the person
nel of the play:
Shylock Richard Hotaling'
Portia , Miss Hilda Clough
Nerissa 31iÂ»s Olga Atherton
Antonio John J . H out-man
Bassanlo J. Allen Ixinn
Gratiano , H. E. de Las Faux
Solanio Kmerson Warfleld
Lorenzo J. J. Rosborough .
Halarino William Melander
Launcelot Gobbo Alfred J. McKlnnon
Old Gobbo C. B. Sloan
Balthaear E. Courtney Ford
In the matter of costuming nothing
more sumptuous has been vouchsafed us
in a dozen yearsâ at least since Dick
Hotaling and Judge Frank Murasky trod
the boards in "Richard III" and Riche
lieu.
And there are many survivors of those
performances who will tell you, If you
ask, what great stunts these were.
A smart house â a gayly caparisoned
house, a pastel house, If you will â will
greet the players, when the Majestic
curtain reveals the Strollers.
And especially smart will the boxes be
â every one of which is sold out, lhe last
two going yesterday to Mrs. Abby Par
rott and Mrs. Horace Pillsbury.
Did you say you wanted a "Doll's
House"â not Ibsen's, but â¢ Reid'sâ for a
Christmas gift to somebody's baby gicl?
Then put a dollar or two in your vest
pocket for a "chance" upon the most
sumptuous doll's house' that e'er- was
builded. There will be a bunch of charm
ing Doctor's Daughters in the lobby to
accommodate you, and if you think you
need a talking machineâ just to keep
things going when your wife is silent
just step up to Miss Jennie Blair or -Miss
Susanne McEwen and tell them so. They
will put you in the way of winning one
of themâ one of the machines, of course
âfor the ridiculous sum of one dollar. â¢\u25a0;-.
Programmes, too, will be sold by the
tireless Daughters, who thus- far have
demonstrated what a lot of earnest wo

TROUBLE AHEAD
FOR THE CADETS
WASHINGTON, Dec. 15.â Whether the
superintendent of the naval academy or
the Secretary of the Navy, both con
jointly, have the power summarily to dis
miss from the naval academy without
trial by court-martial a midshipman
guilty of hazlns, and whether such action
if taken would prove a bar to proceed
ings In the civil courts for assault or oth
er criminal elements involved in the of
fense, are two questions upon which the
Attorney General, at the request of the
Secretary of the Navy, will render an :
opinion to-morrow. The character of this
opinion will shape the future action of
the Navy Department on the recom
mendation of Rear admiral. Joseph H.
Sands, superintendent of the naval acad
emy, for the summary dismissal of Mid
shipman Trenmore Coffin Jr. for hazing,
and of Midshipman Warren A. Vandervere
for countenancing the practice. If Attor
ney General Moody rules that the Secre
tary has such power these midshipmen
will be summarily " dismissed from the
academy. Jf such power is lacking, then
immediate trial by court-martial will be
ordered. Otherwise Secretary Bonaparte
wiji direct that action be brought against
the dismissed midshipmen in the courts
of Maryland.
The doubt in the mind of the Navy De
partment regarding the limits of Its
Jurisdiction arises from the apparent con>
fliet between an act of June 23, , 1874,
which calls for the trial by court-mar
tial for cadets found guilty of hazing
and that of March 3,-1903, which provides
that "any cadet found guilty of partici
pating in or countenancing such practice
shall be summarily dismissed."
Hazing at the academy was the sub
ject of two conferences . to-day between
Admiral Sands and Secretary, Bonaparte.
The admiral informed the secretary that
the cadet officers and cadet petty officers,
at a conference which the admiral hela
with them several days ago,' voluntarily
pledged him their support In his insis
tence upon a strict obedience to all rules
of the academy.'
The ooinion is expressed "at the depart
ment that hazing has existed at the.
Naval Academy for. a long time'under'
cover. Admiral Sands returned to' Ann
apolla this afternoon, where a thorough
investigation of the, conditions 'there-af
ana of Midshipman Warren A. Vendervere
A search is being made ; for 'evidence
against midshipmen who \ have J hitherto
a^en guilty of hazing, and these, as well
as any; hereafter , apprehended", will be
recommended for dismissal.

Witnesses in Humniel Case
Eefuse to Beply to the
Questions of Prosecution
CONSPIRACY IS ALLEGED
Attorney Said to Have Ee
ceived Fifty Thousand Dol
lars From Captain Morse
NSW YORK. Dec. 15.â The prosecution
opened Its case to-day In the trial of
Abraham H. Humniel, the lawyer charged
with conspiracy In the celebrated DoAge-
Morse divorce case. Assistant District
Attorney Rand, In opening- the case, said:
"In this case the act of conspiracy a3
described In law waa committed and the
goods were delivered and paid for. This
particular project vu a very bold one.
It was aimed not only at ths law* of the
State, but its object of attack was nothing
less than the Institution of marrtare and
thÂ© administration of Justice.
"Captain James Morse of the city of
Boston, a ship ownÂ«r. had heard Mrs.
Morse was a divorced woman. He started
to work to see if he could not break up
the marriage. He went to the offlce of
Hummel, this defendant, and a- few daj-3
later Hummel telegraphed to MoraÂ© in
Boston that ho had found such clear
traces of fraud In the case that he would
take the matter up If Captain Morse
would pay him $15,000. Captain Morse
paid Hummel the $15,000 to upset his
nephew's marriage.
"In January. 19W, the Grand Jury pre
sented a charge of perjury against Dodge.
On the same day Dodge was at the St.
Charles Hotel, New Orleans, on his way
to Mexico. Ha knew about it before the
District Attorney. Why should Hummel
want to get Dodge across tha border?
But Dodge was pulled off the train in
Texas.
"Hummel telephoned to Captain Morse:
They've got our man; send us money.*
.There was a constant demand by Hum
mel from Caotain Morse, and n<# less
than $50,000 was paid by. him."
The first witness was Abraham H.
Kaffenbergh, a member of Hummel's law
firm. He was asked whether he had em
ployed counsel in Texas to prevent the
extradition of Charles F. Dodge and also
whether under Hummel's instruction he
attempted to keep Dodge in a perpetual
state of intoxication, but to this and to
other questions he replied: "I decline to
answer on the ground that it might de
grade and incriminate me." He was ex
cused after a short questioning.
Alleged payments of (saptain James T.
MoreÂ© of Boston to Hummel were then
taken up with Nathaniel Cohn, a member
of Hummel's firm, in the witness chair.
He was asked whether he did not receive
sums of money varying from $1500 to $21,
250 at a time from Captain Morse. Cohn
declined to answer all these questions.
The court then adjourned until to-mor
row, after a mass of documentary evi
dence bearing on the divorce and annul
ment proceedings had been introduced.
TEY TO HIDE CRIME
BY BUENIXO BODY
Grewsome Evidence of a Foul
Murder Is Found in
Nevada.
SDeefel Dispatch to The Call. /
RENO, Dec. 15.â A party of_hunters
yesterday discovered the partly burned
skeleton of a man partially concealed by
rocks and ashes at a point on the Trucltee
River known as Sixth Crossing. The
skull had been crushed in at the top, and
the supposition is that the man was mur
dered and an attempt made to burn his
body in order to destroy all traces of the
bloody work. Who the man was is not
known, nor is there any trace of the mur
derers. It Is the opinion of the Coroner,
however, that the man was an employe
on the Government canal and that he Is
a victim of the "Derby Thugs." The re
mains are those of a large man. The
crime was evidently committed some time
ago. The discovery near the- body of a
brass Instrument known as a "wireman's
comealong" gives rise to the belief that
the man was a lineman.
Death of Broker Kullmnn.

Sev. Dr. Toorsanger Founds
an Organization to Assist
Oppressed Co-Eeligionists
EXPLAINS ITS PURPOSES
Holds That Time Has Come
for Jews toVake Initiatory
Steps Against the Outrages
"The International Society for the Pro
motion of Jewish Rights" has Just been
founded by the Rev. Dr. Jacob Voor
â¢angcr. It is the outcome of the dreadful*
persecution to which the Hebrew com
munity of Russia has been subjected.
The object of thi* society is to actively
assist oppressed Jews throughout the
world to secure their civil rights and to
begin a political propoganda looking to the
elimination of all class legislation from
the statute tx>oks of civilized nations.
f Speaking of the objects of the society to
* representative of The Call. Dr. Voor
e&njrer said:
The tl~e hzs cocn* for thÂ» Jowlsh, comxnu-
Bity to tako EomÂ« Initiatory steps lookint to
the prevention of there repeated outrage*. I
s-ra aSmli xvÂ« r.ave relied too much upoa tbe
world's sense cf Juetlc*. We are grateful.
profoundly erateTul. for aZI the sympathy and
leafier centlmÂ«tit we have received on behalf
our unfortunate co-rellfcioniets In these
Jaieful days, but unhappily whole mountains
of sympathy poured into Russia will not deter
one mob from exercl&lnr itÂ» bloody avocation.
"V\"Â« cannot expect from th* governments of
d'villred cations euch actl%-e co-opc-ratlon- as
determined International Interference on be
fcalf of persecuted Christians; at thie very mo-
Snest an international fleet is aÃsemblln* at
tfaÂ« island of Lennos to exercise control over
the Turk and enforce the Independence of
Macedonia.
Israel unhappily is nobody 1 * ox, and when
he 1Â» gored the odor of the running blood
offends nobody's nostrils, consequently we must
â¢Â£t for ourselves.
But our weapons are not the weapons of
anarchy. The idea that a scattered commu
nity can make war upon any Government â¢ is
the rankest nonsense, but we believe it fea
Â«lble by legitimate^means and eyatematlo or
ganization to achieve tbe great- object of as
Â«lst!ne in the elimination of class legislation
against Jews In all countries where such leg
islation still exists, and aa a, consequence Â£ls
criminates against them.
Dr. "Voorsaneer will call a mass meeting
pf the eociety within thÂ© next two weeks
and authorizes the statement that in all
probability the coming spring will witness
the assembling of an International Jewish
Congress to deliberate upon this question
â¢ of securing civil rights of Jews living in
lands where such rights have not yet been
secured to them.

Detective Bailey, who was detailed
en the case, found that the three men
who entered the saloon with Donovan
â¢were also Morse's patrolmen, but hÂ«
tvas unable to Bee them, as they would
cot report for duty till midnight.
Bailey did not believe that chloral had
been administered to Donovan and said
he was subject to long fainting spells.
Donovan's mind was still wandering
last night. He is in the care of his fam
ily at 3 Pine place. His relatives
declare that as Eoon as he regains hid

were conveyed to the railroads:

Mexican Central for rough roadbeds and fresh
roadmasters, and especially thankful that we
got around their loop, - the loop curves and
lived. We must be thankful to the Santa Fe
system for not killing us and for handing us a
little gold to repair our bruises. We must be
thankful to Mr. Murdock for the sending of
our party to Cuernavaca and then forgetting
they were there and leaving them until an un
earthly hour in the morning; also from the
handling of our letters ' we believe he should be
appointed Postmaster 'General at Queretaro. '
Variety, is 'the spice of. life in the new
home of the league. . To-night In the la

to the company. Judge Graham said
that- while the attorneys had done good
work, he would' have to. adjust, f heir
fee to the extent of Rumble's assets in

VICTORS FIND
AMERICAN GUN
There was unloaded yesterday from; the
army transport Thomas, which arrived
Wednesday night from the Orient, a piece
of artillery which has given rise "to some
interesting speculation. It is a war-worn
field piece closely enveloped . in sacking
and with the barrel carefully wrapped
with rope. . -.-' \u25a0-:\u25a0 . \u25a0
â¢It was made In the United States ar
senal at Watervllet, and is now on its
way to the arsenal at Benlda. It was
made by Uncle Sam for : use. by Uncle
Sam's soldiers and Is now in .Uncle -Sam's
possession.' , \u25a0 â¢ '--.;')
According "\u25a0> to" the story 1 told \ on P ,the
transport, however, the field piece was
found in -Port Arthur by the Japanese,
who took' that stronghold. It formed; part
of j Russia's flattery* of "defense and^ pre
sumably.was responsible' for the death of
many Japanese. â¢ ' '
From the inscription engraved Inside the
barrel the Japanese discovered that the
gun was the property of "the United"
States, and the Japanese Government,>so '
goes.the yarn, turnedthe piece of artil
lery over to United States .Minister Grls
com, who sent it to Nagasaki for ship
ment to | the ..United States.
. All the transport records show- Is. that
the gun comes from the â¢ depot quarter
master at Nagasaki and is going- to the ,
commanding - officer at Benlcia j arsenal. .
Inside the barrel is the following leg
end: "Watervliet Arsenal. ; 1898. , ,829
pounds. > No. 209: \u25a0 J. : W.âJ." \u0084 â¢- ' i;
Civilians, who . suppose that- Uncle Sam
manufactures artillery exclusively .for his
own use, are wondering how- this particu
lar bit ofJflghting equipment ever got into
the hands of â¢ the Russians and" whether.
Japan's action in returning- it Is' not an

Former City Councilman Is
Arrested and Says Judge
Ogden Accompanied Him
OAKLAND, Dec. 15.â Did a Superior
J v Jge- Â©t Alameda County ai;d an ex-
Councilman and former candidate for
Mayor Join the "scorchers" who violate
:h<j ordinance lixlng the speed limit for
automobiles? Walter G. Manuel, the
tx-Counciltnan and candidate for th^
Mayoralty, who was driving the nia
thine, says they were not violating the
speed law when he was arrested on
JJaet Twelfth street several days ago.
i'oliceman Feely. who made the arreet,
however, declares that trie machine -was
traveling at least twenty miles an noun
li is now up to Manuel, Superior Judge
1\ B. Ogdcn and their wives to show
l'olice Judge Samuels that Feely was
:..isia.kc:i.
Policeman Feely stood at the corner
ot X&&1 Twelfth street and Tenth ave
nue and watched the 'scorchers"
for two hours. When he left his post
he had the names of twelve persons
who. he ullesed. had violated the
spetd ordinance. One of the urst to
be arrested was Manuel. When Man
uel appeared before l'olice judge Sam
uels this morning hÂ« was in a quan
dary.
"I don't know what plea to offer," he
told the court. "1 believe 1 am inno
cent of violating the law, but rather
than have Judge Ogdcn, Airs! Oeden and
my wife subjected to the inconvenience
uftd unpleasantness of coining to testify
bcre 1 would pay whatever line tho
louit imposed."
Judge Samuels stated that the evi
dence so far was all on the side of the
policeman who made the arrest, and
said he must tine Manuel unless he
could produce evidence to support his
contention. Judge Samuels thereupon
continued the case until December 22,
to allow the other autoists. if they so

HINDU SAVANT TALKS
UN HYPNOTIC FORCE
BERKELEY. Dec. 15.â The myste
rious forces of mind or soul that are
supposed to be responsible for such
phenomena as hypnotism were dis
cussed this morning by Dr. Satthia
iiandhan, an eminent Hindoo scholar,
president of the University of Madras,
In India, during his lecture at the First
Presbyterian Church, under the au
spices of the Pacific Theological Semi
nary.
The distinguished scholar declared
his belief in hypnotism as a moral force,
Inasmuch as the part of man's con
sciousness which is susceptible to hyp
notic effect is the subliminal self â that
deeper layer of self which is in touch
with the infinite, the well spring of all
our moral and spiritual activities. The
lecturer cited the fact, in demonstration
of his theory, that a moral man cannot
be compelled to perform an immoral
action while under hypnotic influence.
Tbe students of the Pacific Theologt
Cal Seminary, with most of the minis
ters of Berkeley, were in attendance
upon the lecture. Following Dr. Sat
thianandhan'B address came question*
from theologians, inspired by the nov
elty of the Hindu .scholar's assertions.
Two more lectures are to be deliv
ered by the Oriental scholar, one on De
cember 19 and the last on December 20.
both .it night, in the First Congrega
tional Church. All will deal with the re
ligions of India and the East.

BRADLEY SAYS ROLLINSES
HAD A DISAGREEMENT.
Arrested Auto Man
Reveals Secret in'
Artist's Wife Says
\ a Reconciliation
Was Effected.
Declares Name Was
Mentioned Out
of Revenge.
OAKLAND, Dec. 15.â As a result of the
arrest of Hiram T. Bradley, an automo
bile agent, on a charge of felony embez
zlement preferred by Mrs. W. E. Porter,
tho accused has made counter charges, in
which he mentions the name of Mrs. W.
E. Rollins, the wife of the well-known
artist, who resides at 592 Thirty-sixth
street. \u25a0 These chargcÃ by Bradley have
led to the discovery that divorce proceed
ings were -Instituted about two months
ago by Attorney Cary Howard on behalf
of Mrs. Rollins, but that a reconciliation
has since been effected.
Bradley, according to his attorney, H.
W. Pulcifer, hinted, that his arrest had
been caused by Mrs. Porter because of
the latter's Jealousy of Mrs. Rollins. He
intimated that Mrs. Porter had become
angry at him because he had Introduced
her husband to Mrs. Rollins, and had
taken this method of revenge.
Mrs. Rollins, on the other hand, de
clares that Bradley was actuated in his
attack on her by a disagreement over a
picture painted by her husband, and for
which Bradley, arter taking it away with
him, refused to pay. She also says that
his resentment against her was height
ened by the fact that after he had called
at her home in an intoxicated condition
to- visit Mxe. E. A. Balsbury, a boarder at
her house, she closed her doors to him
and forbade him to speak to her on any"
pretext whatever.
DRADLEY IS AIIRESTED.
The trouble began yesterday, when
Bradley was arrested on a charge of hav
ing appropriated to his own use two au
tomobiles belonging to W. E. Porter and
his wife, which were placed in his care
"at his garage at 364 Fourteenth street. It
was alleged that he had' refused either to
return or pay for them. Bradley secured
hi? release on bail. He declared" to-day
that his arrest was caused, not for hav
ing appropriated the automo~..es, but as
a means of revenge.
When seen at her. home to-night Mrs.
Rollins, who is the niece of A., H. Glas
cock and is a popular member of theij
artistic and musical set of Oakland, ex
pressed great surprise that her name
should have been brought into the trou
ble. She said:
.Thai roy name has been dragged Into this
case proves that my estimate of -Mr. Bradley
was not far wrong when I ordered him out
of mv house. I first met this man through
Mrs. E. A. Salsbury, a stenographer, who for
six weeks was a boarder at my home. . Brad
ley visited her here, and It was through. her
that I was introduced tp , him. This wsts in
the early part of September. " \u25a0â¢â¢ '. \u25a0'
TAKES PICTURE AWAY.
About September 1 29 Bradley secured /rom
me one of ray husband's paintings,' a street
scene in Oralbi, on the promise that he would
pay- fur it the .next day, which promise he
f&Ued to keep. When I was preparing , to go
on R-.vislt :tÂ«jmy hiisband,/ I gave my grocer
an order on Mr.' Bradley for the amount of
my claim against him., and the next day he
telephoned -me. abusing me- for having given
the order, and repudiating the bill for the
picture, which he refused to return. A day
or two later he called at my home in an intoxi
cated condition to see Mrs. Balsbury, and then
I ordered him never to attempt to enter my
house again.
As for the divorce proceedings instituted by
me. they were simply brought during a time
when my husband was not affording me proper
support, and we have since adjusted our dif
ferences, and the proceedings will be dropped.
As ' for Unking my name with that of Mr.
Porter, that is absurd, for I never, saw him
but once In my life and that was long after I
had brought the divorce suit.
Rollins has attained much repute as a
painter of Hopi Indian life. He is among
the tribe in Arizona making studies for
new canvases. Porter, who it. is said en-
Joys remittances from wealthy relatives
in Canada^ is . with his wife at Lindsay,
Tulare County. , .
DRAWS THE COLOR LINE.
OAKLAND, Dec. 15. â Samuel Evans

uty Sheriff Pftrcy White qn a charge
of battery, alleging that lie had un
lawfully ejected them from L B. Mor
ris' saloon, 1037 Broadway. The negroes
say they went to the resort and called
for liquor and offered to pay $1 a drink,
which was demanded. In a dispute
which followed the pair were put out
of the saloon by White, who had been
summoned by the bartender. Warrants
were refused on the ground that White
was within his rights us a peace of

JUDGE SCORES
AN ORDINANCE
Declares Measure Defining
Duties of Poundmaster
of Oakland Is Ambiguous
OAKLAND. Dec. 15.â The ownership of
a valuable Llewellyn setter caused all
sorts of complications in '-Department; No.
2 of the Police Court this mornlng*and
called forth a sharp condemnation of the
present - ordinance ' regulating the city
pound from Pclice Judge Samuels. ] Inci
dentally .the'ease may cause considerable
trouble for Pcundmaster Julius Zabel,
who is alleged to have sold the setter for
$50 and to have failed to turn in . 20 per
cent of that amount to the city treasury,
as required by the ordinance.- V
About six months P. N. Dean of Point
Richmond lost the dog and despite his
efforts to recover the animal he could
find no clew to aid him in his search un
til recently, when he found the Canine in
the possession of Leo Herbold. Dean de
manded _ his dbg. Herbold showed a re
ceipt proving that he had paid 150 for the
dog to Poundmaster Zabel. Herbold
agreed to deliver his. prize to. the owner
if he were reimbursed, and Dean resorted
to proceedings, which
were heard - to-day and dismissed by
Judge Samuels
"The ordinance defining the duties ., of
the Poundmaster is so ambiguous thatHt
is difficult to ascertain the Intent of the
measure," declared the" Police Magistrate
in dismissing the proceedings. Judge
Samuels held that the ordinance pro
vided that the Poundmaster must kill all
animals not sold or redeemed within
three days after impounding. He de
clared the ordinance could be Interpreted
in several ways and decided that he was
without Jurisdiction in the premises. A
search of the Treasurer's records later
proved that Zabel had not turned in the
20 per cent of the money received from
Herbold. A civil suit for the possession
of the dog was suggested by Judge Sam
uels and will probably follow.

changed and a heavy fail of "rain put a stop
to the work, while there were still many car
loads of flour on the wharf waiting to be
slung aboard the steamship. Under the pro

JAPANESE WAGE
MORALITY WAR
They Bequest Assistance
in an Efforts io Suppress
Gambling iii a Chinatown
. .-. ALAMEDA, Dec. . lÃ.âManager John
H. Hartog of the Alameda ' Advance
ment Association has been taken for a
reformer by the Japanese Young Men's
Christian Association and. the Japanese.
Association. These organizations have
in a joint written request asked Hartog
to assist; them. In their movement; to
abolish gambling among Japanese, and
Ch!nese-in the local Chinatown. The
Japanese say that they . have . appealed
to the police to- suppress the games of
chance, but -with unsatisfactory re
sults. .', â¢ " â¢- -\u25a0 ' ' -
i. In the letter to Hartog, which is
signed by S. Tasaki for- the two Japan
ese-associations, .the writer says: :' , â¢:
' We 'have been 'trying very hard for > a long
time to break ud the Barnes and to prevent
the - JaDaneae from . attending ; them, \ but in ,
vain. Sometimes the games have been stopped
for a week or two. but as soon as our vigi
lance"'lessens they take up their disreputable
business on a greater siale. At first therÂ« |
wÂ«re : but twe - tables for gambling In the
whole of Chinatown. . Now there are fifteen, I
which shows the increaee in the number or I
gamblers. Until " about two years ago the
I Japanese in Alameda were in general honest,
diligent people/ and we had few cases â¢of
fighting. But since gambling has become so
general lam sorry to say that there has been
an Increase "of bad,- lazy Japanese and fight
ing and stealing are often heard of. Through
.gambling they lose everything, economically
and morally, that enables them to live as
bpnest people should. We have apnealed. to
the police, but it my judgment Is not â¢ mis
taken, they seem not to take enough interest
in gambling to break It up. I. don't know
why the police are indifferent to It. I be
lieve . they- could stop gambling here If they |
wanted to. "â¢ . â¢. |
There itre a great many rumors reflecting .
en the officials, but I don't like to believe j
them true.: A certain policeman. Brown by
name, .called on me a few weeks ago and
asked "what was our Intention, to break- up
the gambling -itself or to prevent Japanese
from . playing the games. I told him that it
would be enough for us If he could stop the
Japanese from, going to the gambling houses,
but I added that I did not think he could
do so, as U Was very difficult for any man to
repent of his sin and follow a new course of
life if the temptation to sin was always near
at hand. Some months ago I called -on the
Chief of Police and he agreed to .stop It If
I showed 'him where gambling was going on.
That very evening gambling stopped of Us
own accord, but It was only -temporarily.
Manager Hartog in his reply to the
Japanese, associations assures them
that he will refer their communication
to the City Trustees, and in his answer
says in part:
Allow me to emnhaslre that the Alameda
Advancement Association Is not an antl-vlce
committee, but its purpose is to promote the
interests of the city, and we must be careful
not to go beyond our purpose. However,, the
way you put It, you are â¢ probably right i In
appealing to the aid of our association, for.
If the quiet and diligent Japanese are turned
Into thieves and rowdies. It seems to com* |
within our sphere of action. What you say j
about the reflections on the police I 'trust are
unfounded. I believe lhat you will agree with
me that Chief of Police John Conrad would
not for a moment countenance any , connivance
on the Dart of his force with lawbreakers.

CARRY BATTLE
INTO COURTS
POINT RICHMOND. Dec. 15.â The bat
tle between the annexationists and the
anti-annexationists took a new turn to
day, when the a'ntis, represented by Pills
bury, Madison & Sutro of San Francisco,
procured an injunction against the City
Trustees to restrain them from holding
an annexation election on December 22.
The hearing was set by Superior Judge
Wells for December 21 at Martinez, the
day before the election date. The ques
tion is whether the proceedings taken to
annex all of San Pablo school district to
tho" city of Richmond are according to
the statutes governing the annexation of
"uninhabited lands."
The issue is between the townspeople
and the five big land owning corporations,
whose holdings were not included within
the city's boundaries when the city of
Richmond, was incorporated. These cor
porations are the Pacific Coast Oil Com
pany, East Shore Company, E. S. Tewks
bury estate^ John* Nlchqll Company: and
the Point Richmond Land and Canal
Company. Their properties extend from
Point Potrero to Point San Pablo, along
the bay shore, and cover several thousand
acres. They are opposed to being an
nexed on the ground that they do not de
sire to . pay city taxes on unproductive
holdings. \u25a0 *
A mass meeting of citizens in favor of
annexation was held to-nlgnt, at which
former State Senator E. K. Taylor of
Alameda, father of the annexation law,
delivered an address. The City Trustees
will resi3t the petition of the opposition
for a permanent injunction to prevent the
holding of the election.

With Stories of Graft
BERKELEY, Dec. 15.â W. K. Weir,
president of the Board' of Education, Is
sued a statement to-day denying Archi
tect Charles Faff's charge that irregulari
ties have marked the work of the School
Board In the matter of awarding con
tracts and spending public money. In hU
statement President Weir defies Architect
Paff to prove his allegations and invites
him to appear before the Board of Educa
tion next Monday night, where opportu
nity will be given the architect to make
hl3 charges publicly. Mr. Weirs state
ment follows: ' -.
' TbÂ«f statements of Architect Paft aro exceed
irffly Indefinite and. as far aa I am concerned^
are absolutely false. I challenge him to bring
his proof before the Board of Education. L*t
htm make his charges there in open meettns
and bring hla proof. TaerÂ« will bÂ« an ad

At that time Mr. Paff will be Â«WÂ«n all tha

M* has said that tha beard Is full of gran.
LÂ«t him produce the evidence to support this
statement. - ,â¢- ';' : \u25a0- . ."
Mr. Weir's challenge to Mr. Paff is the
sequel to a story of School Director
Haseltine beingr offered a bribe of sev
eral hundred dollars^ to use his influ
ence to havo the architect's plans
adopted for some of the school build
ings the School Directors are to have
constructed. Haseltlne informed his
colleagues of the alleged attempt to
bribe him. and Paft's name, it is re
ported, was stricken from the list of
competing architects. Haseltine has
refused to discuss the matter, neither
denying nor a.*hrralnff the story of tho
attempt at bribery. Paff has resented
the use of his name in connection with
ths story, denies that'he sought to
bribe Haseltine or any one else, and
voices his belief that if any crooked
work was done in the Board of Educa
tion the Directors them3elve3 are re
sponsible.

Coy ran afoul cf an o!d order of arrest
fcr nonpayment of alimony yesterday,
&sd before he kntw it he was explaining
to Judge Graham how it happened- More
thaii a year ago McCoy was divorced by
Hose McCoy and he was ordered to pay
her JSII a month fcr the support of their
children. .
McCoy only paid Jl9 a month under the
order, however, and finally left the city.
Recently he returned and went to the
family home to see his youngsters. Mrs.
McCoy refused to permit him io see the
children, with the result that he applied
to Judge Graham for an order. Then the
court informed him that an order of ar
rest in his case had long been awaiting
\u25a0 service and that unless he paid Mrs. Mc-
Coy the full sum due her he would be
severely dealt with next Tuesday. McCoy
agreed to obey the court, and went away
announcing, however, that after he has
paid the alimony due he -wrili renew his
appeal for permission to see his children.

to be free of it. The baby was very fair

THE PRESIDENT'S LETTER.
*-pÂ»HE letter written by the President in response to the Mer
| chants' Exchange is a restatement of his well-known position
* on the admission of exempt Chinese. A settled and determined
effort has been made here to misrepresent the President and Sec
retary Taft in this matter. It has been used as local political capi
tal, and men who do business as agitators have taken charge of
public opinion on that subject, and have improved the opportunity
offered by the seeming indifference of the community.
The President is of the opinion that the boycott was caused
by the unjust infliction of pains and penalties upon exempt Chinese.
The proof of this is believed to be found in the maintenance of a
different standard of humiliation for such Chinese. For a long
time official opinion seemed to be that treatment that would hu
miliate an American was not humiliating, to an intelligent Chinese.
This course of conduct, long persisted in, finally roused in China
a resentment that is not at all discreditable to that people.
Xot only was provocation given in the case of the exempt
classes, but the terms of the law and treaty in relation, to Chinese
laborers have been persistently and flagrantly violated. By the
supreme law of the land Chinese laborers who were here when the
cct for registry and exclusion passed have the same rights as aliens
of any other race, with the sole exception of the right to naturali
zation. Notwithstanding this, we read with complacency that in
towns in California and other States Chinese are ordered out and
their property is burned. Since the President's letter was written
a mob in Redding attacked a party of Chinese laborers and drove
them away under threat of murder if they remained. That is in
violation of our treaty and of our national good faith. If Americans
are attacked by a mob in China this country is profoundly stirred,
and demands are made for action by our Government, because Chi
nese have violated the treaty. But American mobs attack peaceable
and orderly Chinese, and if our Government act in their defense
by request of China it is made a reason for abuse of the national
administration.
China is sending a large number of students to the schools and
universities of the Western nations, to equip them for the parlia
mentary and constitutional government which that empire intends
to install within the next ten years. It is of special interest and im
portance to us that China shall have such a Government, and that
it shall be influenced by the American education of a large number
of those who will administer it. Yet in our university "city of
Berkeley a determined effort was made to make it impossible for
Chinese students to live. Xot long ago a large party of Chinese
students, on arrival at one of our Pacific ports, were treated with
such extreme harshness as amounted to brutality, and finally, indig
nant at the cruelty they had to endure, they voluntarily, abandoned
their enterprise, saying they had no desire to seek education in a
country that had such official representation. They returned to
China and subsequently went to European universities.
It is time that our people who are interested in commerce witl?
Eastern Asia began to comprehend what such things mean. It is
time they understood that we cannot harry, abuse and mob unof
fending Chinese and at the same time enjoy our share of their
trade. Our Government has laboriously sought to gain and protect
trade in China. Mr. Hay planned and executed wisely and well to
that end. But all the wisdom shown by the Government is nullified
by the mistreatment of Chinese lawfully here, if it is winked at by
public opinion.
Since,the regeneration of Japan it should be apparent to every
body, especially on our Pacific Coast, that if we are to' get across*
the Pacific the same commerce in volume that our Eastern seaboard
has across the Atlantic we must be prepared to give China' and
Japan perfect equality of treatment with other nations. Chinese
coolies are no greater and no less peril to American labor than the
excessive immigration of the lowest classes of Southeastern Europe.
Labor Commissioner Sargent has expressed the opinion that ex
clusion should apply to all if to any. If immigration of labor is to
be limited to our absorbent capacity, let the limitation apply to all
races alike. It is undignified in our Government to open a wide door
to the ingress of one class of aliens, who immediately upon landing
join the hue and cry for total exclusion of another class of aliens.
The President is eternally right when he declares to our mer
chants that we have no right to exact justice from others unless
we do justice to them. He is right, also, in appealing to public
opinion in California to move itself aright in favor of justice to the
Chinese by protecting them in every right they have under our laws
and treaties, which are the supreme law of the land.
It must be remembered that China has been slow in resent
ment of mistreatment. The cause has been accumulating for many
years. That nation may be expected to recede slowly from its at
titude of antagonism to our trade. That process will be accelerated
by a proper manifestation of public opinion in support of the efforts
of our Government. We are perfectly well aware that there are
those among us who continually cry that the declaration of our
Government that justice shall be done to China is taken in that em
pire as an evidence of weakness and fear. This is a vicious and mis
leading suggestion. There are Chinese who have as clear a con
ception of personal and national ethics as we have. Every friendly^
act of our Government has been fully appreciated at Peking, not as
an expression of weakness, but as evidence of a desire to do right,
offered by a nation amply able to protect itself against wrong.
THE TREASURY REPORT.
rpHE report of the Secretary of the Treasury is issued and con-
I tains a mass of interesting and useful information. The revenues
\u25a0*\u25a0 for the fiscal year ending the 30th of last June were $697,101,
269 95, and the expenditures were $720,105,498 55, leaving a deficit
of $23,004,228 60. Of this $15,065,257 was to cover the usual an
nual deficit in the Postoffice Department. If the Government were
able to carry on that branch of business on a paying basis, the
deficit for the year would be only $7,938,971 60. As it is, the total
deficit is much less than was feared at the beginning of the year.
The customs receipts continue to lead those from internal reve
nue, being $261,798,856 91 to $234,095,740 85 from the excise taxes.
The Secretary reports that all payments on- the Pacific railroad debts
are made promptly on maturity. The total receipts of revenue in
creased, over those of 1904 by $12,886,896 21. The Louisiana Pur
chase Exposition has fully repaid to the Treasury the Federal ap
propriation of $4,404,942 96 given in its aid by Congress. It is grat
ifying that with an increase in revenue there was a decrease of
$5,879,447 10 in expenditures.
Since the national banks went into operation there have been
438 failures in forty-three years, and the. total loss caused thereby
is only 22 per cent, which isa most creditable record that certifies
the soundness of the. system, and the excellence of its official over
tight. It is an argument for putting the insurance business of the
country under similar oversight and restraint.. Since 1900 twenty
four national banks have been chartered in California. Our total is
now sixty-six banks, with a capital of $7,637,800, which exceeds the
total national bank capital of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Utah,
Nevada, Arizona and Alaska. It is not exceeded by any State until
we get to Illinois, which has $9,000,000, while New York has only
$9,722,000. Our national bank capital per capita of population prob
ably exceeds that of any other State. The total condition of the
5757 national banks of the whole country shows a surplus of three
times the amount required by law. The surplus and undivided
profits are 77 per cent of the paid in capital. This is a very pros
perous condition and shows very careful banking. During the year
individual deposits increased $362,465,045, which is nearly equal to
the entire money of the country in iB6O.
. The Secretary recommends some provision for an elastic cur
rency.* The need of this is shown by the fact that money in mid-

summer commanded only 1 per cent interest, and in November call
loans reached 25 per cent. The high rate was the reaction from the
low, and both -were dangerous. It is recommended that national
banks be permitted to issue Government guaranteed currency equal
to 50 per cent of their bond secured currency, but subject to a tax
of 5 or 6 per cent. It is strongly advised that no new or unguar
anteed form of currency be injected into our system, and it is be
lieved that the tax on this elastic issue will abundantly protect the
Government in its guarantee. Such money would not be issued
unless the interest rate exceeded the tax, â and .it would promptly
retire when interest rates became' normal, that is to say, 'when they
became less than the tax. It is believed that this plan would prevent
interest exceeding 10 per cent, and as it involves no element of dan
ger and would relieve the Treasury of the responsibility of easing
the market at the crop moving season or other demand for in
creased currency it should be tried, and if it justify itself it will
stand. :â¢\u25a0\u25a0;. ;.^
Not the least interesting part of the report is the statement of
the amount of money in the country'; and the' per \ capita for the
last forty-four years. In iB6O, when, the shadow;of the panic of 1857
was met by the signs of profodnd political disturbance, the total
amount of money -in- the United States was $442,102,477, or $13 85
per capita. The expulsive effect; of the Civil War in 1801; reduced
the. per capita to $10 23. It rose gradually\by gTeenback* inflation
to $20 57 in 1865, and then under the, prospect of specie' resumption
declined to $15 32 in 1877. hen .:** r Â°se tp;s24 52 in : 1894 arid fell
again to $21 ' 41 ; in 1896: ;. From that point it has . risen' steadily, until
now the total money in the country is the largest T volume in pur
history, being $2,587,882,653, or a per capita of $31 08. Of this sum,;
let, it be noted that; $2,031,296,042 is in coin and' bullion,: almost
satisfactory showing:. Every dollar is worth-ioo cents in cold.'

Board Finds That Incor
rlgibie Miss Was Not Badly
Treated by Superintendent
-LOS ANGELES. Dec. 15.â The investi
gation by the trustees of the Whittier
State Reform School into the charges
cf cruelty to Inuiates was finished to
cay. and Dr. Walter Lindley, chairman,
gave out the following resolution
adopted by the board: . *
Resolved, first. That hereafter no male of-
shall Inflict corporal punishment upon
f^r.y pirl la the school.
Resolved, etcond. That the hair of no girl
ehail be cat off as a matter of punishment.
Resolved, third. That the superintendent
Jnake once a week in writine a reiKirt to each
trustee, giving in detail all punishmÂ«nt-
The investigation was the result of
charges of cruelty to Mabel Sylva, an
inmate of thd Whittier institution, who
was punished for insubordination. The
findings in the Sylva case were as fol
lows:
That on or about September 15 Mabel Sylva}
received corporal punishment by means of a
eirap with rounded edges, three inches wide
tnd twenty-tour Inches In length, and received
first, four stroke*, and she continuing her mis
cenieanor, received five or six strokes more.
That the said punishment was administered
by the assistant superintendent, by order ot
the euDenntendent, after a Judicial hearing
and In his presence and that of the matron,
and that the eace was not excessive or cruel.
The evidence was conclusive that there was
r.o tolood draAvn itnd that there were no lacera
tions.
That the Immediate cause of said punisfa
ir.ent was the continued rebellious conduct of
two or three rlris, of whom said Mabel Sylva
â¢was cue. who had got beyond the control of
the women in authority over the girla' de
j.artrn*nt. Ir. consequence the superintendent
was sent tor and the punishment administered
as a last resort after other measures had
i*ilcd.

Groves in the Golden State
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN BERNARDINO, Dec. 15.â Z. Var
ner, of the Senate Hotel in Johnstown,
Pa., has written to Chief of Police Shay
of this city directing him to arrest his
son, C. Varner, and a female with whom
young Varner left Johnstown several
weeks ago. The young man had $360 with
him when he left.
The woman, who is stopping at a first
class hotel in this city, seems to have se
cured the cash, as Varner is out in the
cold and waiting for his father to send
him money on which to go back to the
East. As the couple are not charged with
any crime, the Chief of Police will be
unable to follow out the senior Varner's
wishes.
Young Varner says he was deluded
into bringing the young woman to Cali
fornia by her story that she had a
wealthy aunt living near this city who
owned a banana grove and who was
yearning to leave her niece all her
wealth provided she would come out and
visit her.

After His Eegular Work
O'BBIEN STILL FAVORITE
Cornisliman's Showing With
George Gardner Believed
to Be Behind the Price
As the tljnÂ© for the gxmg to Bound
draws nearer. Bob FitsimrnonÂ», Jack
O'Brien's next opponent, looks happier
md feels livelier. Fitz has never ex
perienced the rt&ge fright sensation and
tn the midst of thÂ© hottest hail of gloves
he always has his thinking machinery
â¢well under control. Fitz engaged in Â»e
Â£ret gymnasium work yesterday after
fcoon, boxing with Billy Bates and Harry
Chester. He was somewhat put out be
6ause It rained, but as his training spell
is about over he does not think the
Weather will have ajiy marked effect oo
&â¢ stamina and general good condition.
Fitz expressed great sa.tlsfaction at his
condition yesterday after he had com
pficted his work. This was particularly
â¢tvere as he went six rounds with each
of his 6parring mates and then spent
forty minutes In shadow boxing, eome
thi:ig he has never trieÂ£ to this extent
)>cfore. Ho showed no signs of weariness

On Thursday night Fitz created some
what of a ripple by making a short talk
at the meeting of the West End Alame
da Improvement Association. He hap
pened to drop into thÂ© hall where thÂ©
organization convenes weekly, the hall
being tbe camÂ© where Fitz exhibits when
he has a largo audience. The president
of the Improvement club, noticing Bob In
the crowd, invited him to Bay a few
\u25a0words. Fitz blushed rlgh* out in meet-
Ing, but, after recover! g his second
wind, made a solar plexus hit with a
brief address on the beautiful streets
*nd avenues of Alameda. To-day and
to-morrow Fitz will resume his public
training work.
O'Brien is still a 7 to 10 choice in what
little betting le being done. This Is con
sidered a false price by many people,
especially as Fitz has -withstood his sieg-e
of training fo well. Some of his friends
offered to bet yesterday that the Cornish
znan will be favorite when the men en
ter the ring Wednesday night.
O'Brien does not like some references
Fitz has made regarding their last fight
at Philadelphia. His version Is:
"While I was training- my manager
came to camp one day and said that
matters had been arranged and that
Fitrslmmons and myself were merely
to box a fa6t exhibition. I was quite
eatlsfied with the arrangement and Im
mediately ceased training. A few days
before the contest reports came to me
that Fitz was working his head off to
get into shape. I thought it strange
and I told my manager that it looked
â¢A 6 if Fitzsimmons was trying to dupe
me. I tried to nee Fitz, who simply
avoided me. I asked him on the night
of thÂ© flg-ht what he Intended to do.
ntz said I would have to look out for
myself, that he would get me If he
could."
The Kale of eÂ«ats will commence this
morning at the Belvedere on O'Farrell
Street The advance orders received by
Manager Jim Coffroth indicate that there
xs considerable interest In the fight and
that It will be witnessed by a large at
tendance. Fitz Is always spectacular and
Cives the ppectators a run for their
fnoney.

KID HERMAN DEFEATS EDDIE HANLON
VICTOR PROVES
GREAT FIGHTER
Herman Outgenerals Hanlon
in One of the Fastest
Bouts Seen in the South
LOSER GAINS IN FAVOR
His Gameness and Aggres
siveness Throughout the
Twenty Rounds Applauded
Special Dlipatch to Tha Call.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 15.â Punched into
a pulp, his face systematically ham
mered with every blow on the pugllistio
books for full twenty rounds, gamÂ© little
Kiddie Hanlon met his Waterloo last night
at the hands of Kid Herman, whose
showing stamps him aa one of the olever
est, fastest lighters who ever boxed here
at any weight. Outclassed and outpoint
ed from the firÂ»t. battered to the red
ness of a pickled beet, swollen of mouth
and puffed of eye, Hanlon took his modi
cine liko the man he is. He acknowl
edged the corn without a murmur, grasp
ing his opponent's hand warmly at the
olosÂ© and mustering up a wan, pitiful
remnant of a smile, perhaps the gamest
thing he did in a whole evening replete
with brave bearing up under a rapid Are
of uppercuts, Jabs, jolts and full arm
smashes that would have put out ten less
sturdy battlers than himself:
Standing up for once, cutting out the
crouch that was fast making him un
popular, Halon, though beaten, quit with
more friends than he had two hours be
fore. The spectators with one voice
cheered him and will be glad to pay good
money to see him go another time.
Beaten by one of the most finished ar
tists in the business the native son had
at least the assurance that some who
rank higher In the fistic scaje would have
fared no better. Kid Herman is likely to
prove the rock upon which more than one
pugilistic ambition Is cast away. Game
as they grow, strong as a little bull, long
on endurance and a free punishing hitter
from any position, he conducts a battle
with consummate generalship and Is as
hard to hit as a ghost. In and out of the
clinches Incessantly pumping in hard
right-hand uppercuts with occasional
smashing crosses flush upon the mouth
and face, the Chicago boy had Hanlon
guessing from the first, fire.
One round was almost a repetition of
every other with Hanlon aotlng as re
ceiver general throughout.
No cleaner cut decision ever was given
and no one could find fault with it, not
even the beaten man himself. Hanlon
was an 8 to 10 favorite. There was not
a moment from start to finish of every
round that the two lightweights were not
in action, and every gong found them
fighting. Hanlon forced the pace and
made It a terrific one from thÂ© start and
never for an instant gave ground.

There was a long discussion at the
meeting of the San Francisco Labor Coun
cil last night over the action taken by
the Typographical Union in its advocacy
of fair dealing with an evening newspaper

egate present had expressed his views on
thÂ© subject the council declined to Indorse
the resolution presented by the Typo
graphical Union as against a co-ordinate
branch of the Labor Council whoso body
caw fit to declare a boycott.
In support of the stand taken by the
Typographical Union, the City Front
Federation went one better at Its last
meeting and adopted a strong set of reso
lutions Indorsing the stand taken by the
Typographical Union and thÂ© Allied

against the use of a boycott, thus dlvid-.
ing the unionized forces of labor on the

GREGOR X RETURNS TO FORM,
BEATING HIS FIELD EASILY
Gossiper Leads Gut
a Cluster of Fast
Ones.
Prominence Scores
at a Lengthy
Quotation.
BY FRED E. MUIHOLLAM).
Qresor X, whose Itinerary has included
nearly ail of the Southern and Middle
Western tracks for the past three years,
became revivified yesterday by the rain
and sloppy footing:. He made a small field
look -foolish in the concluding: mile run at
InÂ«leslde. The dockers had him .touted
from Steve Bansuinetti'B to the life-saving
station on the beach, and at odds of 11 to
6 the gelding won by as many splashes
as he wanted to. Teddy Robinson, who
piloted him, scraped the corners olosely
without losing- any ground or twisting a
pedal. St. George took the place and
Blue Eyes ran third. At the last minute 1
the money was shoveled into the books
on Gateway, making the Burnett entry
an 8 to 3 favorite. He ran with a decided
list to the starboard, and if his showing
was a true one mud is not his forte.
FIELDS ARE DNWIELDV.
Large and unwieldy fields caused bat
tors to be wary and inclined to choke up.
Favorites more than held their own at
that, capturing four events.
The colors of "Boots" Durnell were seen
for the first time at the meeting on Prom
inence, in the opening two-year-old dash,
and thÂ© filly was returned a winner. Her
price receded from 8 to 8 and 10.- Wiley
got the outsider home more than a length
before Abe Meyer, another long one. Le
gal Form, the post favorite, finished back
in the ruck.
Just because he possessed some early
speed, the aged campaigner Olympian,
from Johnny Schorr's stable, picked up
the first mile purse. A 13 to' 5 choice,
Knapp kept him going Just long enough
to beat Love's Labor a nose. Leash
was a close third, after being badly
interfered with in the stretch.
Loague finished third on HI Caul Cap,
favorite for the second mile selling affair.
The big gelding requires strong handling
and Loague's efforts were entirely inade
quate. Crosswaite astride Cloche d'Or.
after looking hopelessly out of it, mowed
down his field and finally defeated the
pacemaker, Tarn OShanter, more than a
length.
Gossiper with Tommy Clark up and a 2
to 1 favorite led her field from start to
finish in the Futurity course selling
sprint. The filly went to the post
favorite and splashed in a couple of
lengths in front of Escamado, the Bald
win entry. Show honors went to The
Roustabout..
It was fortunate indeed for Briers that
she beat the eate in the mile and fifty
yard run, decided under selling condl
tions^ The advantage "thus gained at the
start served her in good stead at the
end, for Rey Dare closed strongly, losing
the decision by a scant half length only.
Royalty, the runner ud for seven fur
longs, finished third.
NOTES OF. THE TRACK.
Tommy Clark piloted two winners â â¢
Gossiper and Briers.
The Keene brothers, with their big
string and Jockey Herman Radtke,
will not leave California for New Or
leans just yet. Jack Keene started for
the railroad office to secure a car yes
terday, but at the last moment changed
his mind and will stay. This will be
good news for turfgoers. The Keene
stable horses are always out for the
money, and Radtke has become a public
idol.
While the Pacific-Union handicap will
attract a pplendld field of two-year-olds
to the post this afternoon, it is over
shado\Â£d by the interest displayed in
the meeting- of Bearcatcher and Cruza
dos. Trainer Tom Cook of the Bald
win stable thinks no horse In Califor
nia can beat Cruzados at five and a half
furlongs. Mud, too, is the bay sprint
er's trump card, but fog is barred,
owing to a wind affection. Garnet Fer
gxiÃon stated that mud would suit his
brown whirlwind all right, although he
would have preferred to see a dry
track. As neither of the cracks ,is a
particularly good actor. Starter Â« Jake
Holtman will possibly send them away
to a flying start.
Harry Beck broke down hopelessly on
the far turn in the third race, and a
few minutes later a kindly bullet end
ed the old gelding's career. V
Owing to a. death in the family of
Charles Kerr. the Antrim Stock Farm
yearlings were not sold last evening.
Instead they will be led into the ring
at Chase's salesyard on Monday, night
next The yearlings from Rulnart
Stock Farm and Paplnta Ranch will be
disposed of at the same time.
Barney Schreiber offered Keene Bros.
$1000 a month for a second call -con
tract on the services of Radtke yester
day. This applied to the California
season.

SEEKS DEATH
AFTER FAILURE
Grieving over the loss of the savings of
a lifetime, Benjamin D. Rice, aged 34
years, attempted to end his Ufa yesterday
by Inhaling illuminating gas in a lodging
house at 1049 Market street.
The attempt was frustrated by treat
ment at the Central Emergency Hospital
by Dr. Tillman. Rice wrote a number of
letters accusing his associates in a scheme
to acquire a fortune quickly of "legally
robbing" him. From the tenor of these
letters he had evidently contemplated
killing his associates.
The men whom the old man imagines
have wronged him are: E. TV. Conant,
Treasurer of Santa Clara County, and E.
C. Stowe and H. Ray Fry of San Jose.
They were associated with him in the
Golden State Mining Company, which cor
poration is also promoting a scheme to
pit and candy prunes. \u0084.'.:.
Rice came here from Kansas about four
months ago with $2000 which he was anx
ious to swell into a fortune. The prune
candying scheme Interested him and he
invested all his money in it. Rice was
elected vice president of the concern. He
says that no work was done by the com
pany and he sought to get control and
push the scheme. In this he failed.
"I cannot get my money back." reads
one of the letters of the would-be suicide,
"therefore I am going to step down and
out. For the money Is all that I have,
and the trouble has started me to drink
ing, which I have not done for some time.
I have found out that even if the business
did succeed that they expect to freeze
me. out so that I would get nothing any
way."
SAN JOSE, Dec. 15.â County Treasurer
E. â¢W. Conant, who is charged by Rice
with complicity in a scheme to swindle
him out of $2000, emphatically denies
Rice's story. He states that Rice saw an
advertisement in the papers offering stock
of the Golden State Mining Company for
sale and Invested his money after coming
here to investigate. '
The Golden State Mining Company is a
corporation in which a number of well
known San Joseans are interested. The
company owns the patent rights in a
process for candying prunes, as well as
for a prune pitting machine, which was
invented by Colonel Rickert of this city.
Conant said:
"In my opinion Rice was not . In . his
right mind when the attempt at suicide
was made. He had been drinking hard
for some time and his actions have been
very erratic. There is no truth in tne
story that we robbed him. He is in the
same position as the rest of us who have
put money up to promote the prune can
dying enterprise."
Young Choynftkl Kaocked Out.
STOCKTON. Deo. IB.â ln one of thÂ»
fastest fights ever held In the West
Kid Krant of Seattle knocked out
Young: Choynski of San Francisco to
night in the first minute of the tenth
round with a right swing to the Jaw.
Krant was quite badly punished, but
his blocking was of a high order, and
he saved himself many times by his
clever footwork. Kid Bell of Denver
knocked out Hock Morallls In the first
round. Hopper made Moffatt stop In

LOS ANGELES, Deo. 15.â The Los

by defeating Tacoma, 3 to 1. This gave
the home team five out of the nine
post-season games to bo played with
Tacoma for the championship, each,
team having won half of the divided
season. Gray was the principal factor
in to-day's game. He pitched in great
form throughout and allowed Tacoma
but three scattered The visitors*
only score was made when Mohler
stole home. One of the spectacular fea
tures was a triple play by Tacoma In
the eighth inning. Dillon had singled
and Cravath doubled, advancing Dillon

REDUCE RATE ON FLOUR
WHEN COMPETITION THREATENS
North Pacific Steamship Line* Knock
Oil Half a Dollar on Freight
Charges.
PORTLAND, Dec. 15.â The North Pa
cific Oriental Steamship lines have de
cided to maintain the rate of $4 a ton on
flour from North Pacific points to Japan
ese ports after January 1. At a meeting
of the lines a month ago a rate of $4 60
for the first part of 1906 was announced.
The chartering of an independent steam
er at $4 by shippers to load on Puget
Sound and the threat to engage more at
the same rate was followed by to-day's
action. The tariff to Kongkong and Ma
nila of $4 60 and to Shanghai of J3 will
remain as formerly fixed by tho regular
lines.

NEW YORK, Dec. 15. â A cable dis
patch to the Herald from Caracas,
Venezuela, says:
President Castro withdrew "Wednes
day, not only the objectionable phrase,
but his counter protest, thus avoiding
the necessity of answering the reply of
France to the Venezuelan memoran

This act is a confirmation of the an

Sonoma Sails Late
for the Anti-
Rain Impedes the
Manchuria's
Loading.
May Be Unable to
Leave on Sched
ule Time.
The Ocear.ic Steamship Company's liner
Sonoma, Captain Herriman, sailed last
r.iÂ«ht for Honolulu. Paeo Pago, New
Zealand and Australia with a lull cargo
and many passengers. Among the latter
are a number of prominent Honolulu peo
l''tc returning to the islands for the
Christmas festivities.
The Cunard Company's new turbine
liner Carmania was responsible for the
late departure of the Sonoma. The Brit
ish-Australian mails were on board the
Cannaxia. when she made her maiden trip
across the Atlantic. Like all new vessels,
the Os.rmar.ia did not "2nd herself right
away, and when heavy weather was en
countered all hope for record breaking,
cr even average speed, vanished. She
t:iade a long trip and landed the Austra
lian mail In New York too late for con
nections to be made with the Sonoma by
Thursday at 2 p. m., the Oceanic liner's
echeduled hour for departure. So the So
noma's sailing was postponed and the So
noma's engines will be called upon to
make up for the Carmar.ia's tardiness.
Although late in New York and late here,
the colonial mail will bo rushed ashore
et Auckland on schedule time.
Among the Sonoma's passengers were
the following: â¢

, NEW YORK. Dec. 15.â Tfcs wars of proflt
'Wlnx sales which swept thÂ« ls.U stock ro*r
j4Â» :-t yesterday was carried orer into the early
n^iiitipri te-<iaj-. and during the first b<Â« r Â°i
the irlilÃg prices ranged cons , ! , d , erab , ly ( ,
Jast night. The course of the seeing hsd spent
ir^elf bj' that time *ud there were recoveries
eird later eon:e rer^mption of the agfrressive
*iidinÂ« v-o of orices. Tie market was the
dullest of tbe week, however, and was decid
edly iecklSK in animation and variety. Tne
1; recast of the bank statement gave premise
t' Â«a improved condition to bs reflected to
Â»r.3.rrow. But this has been the factor in the
Â«/r*nrth of the market all through the week.
Lr-\ to-dar eentiment tv inclined to a for
ward cast to factors beyond. Tbe call Â»poney
market iuelf was otlffer and revealed the
f&ct tbat ar.y resources aided to the toanK
SiOldings in the week had been fully availed
of. Tbe movement toward New York from
domestic centers setms to have been heavy.
and it is estimated to have been sufficient to
yield a rain of cash in the neighborhood cf
jr. OOO.iCy. after allowing for the loss of $l.i<s,
000 on the week's subtreasury operations.
3P*reient was also begun to-fiay of the antici
pated Jannarr 1 Government tot * re "> n 'f"-^ 1
amcuEts in the aggregate to Botne $4.200.CÂ«j0.

*3.000.<X<0 <llr*ctly to the New York money
market. Furtfcenxiore the dividend of *10 per
share on Standard -Oil rtock wa Â»Â»V/?^^
<aÂ»y, calling for the disbursement of f10.000.000.
<Â£ht fact tfcat call money was hither again
*n snite of these sources of recuperation was
attributed to the approach cf thÂ« yÂ»ar-Â«nd
P<Miod with its large requirement*, and eet>e
cJally to the marked developments in forelrn
money markets. The open market discount
rste in London rose abruptly to about the
*.ar.k rate in reÂ«>onÂ«e to the measures of the
Sank of Enriand. including borrowing from
Ti.e market and the raiein* cf its actual lend
lnjr rate. The price Of gold was also' ad-
VincttJ These are the usual prelim! nariee
v* making effective an intended advance In
the official discount rate. There were more
'.vithdrawals of gold from the bank for Bouth
.America. Â»'\u2666*â¢ â¢ 'â â ' *Â» <rth *' A^nmnA indi
cated for thÂ« Fame cestinetlon and with an
*xi*cted arrival of $2,000,000 in gold on Mon
<*sy secured for Part*. The sterling rate at
BÂ«iin slso contlnuod to decline. The rewjlt of
Thes^ developments was of far-reaching effect
in all the world's money markets. Our own
'oreien exchange market advanced In response.
.*â¢'' eolte of tbe rise In the money rate. In
a!Â«o of the improvement in the Novem-
V*r bÂ«lÂ«nce of trade in our favor, the ex
<Â»Â»= of mercantile exports orer impc-rts for
the month having risen to $17.â¬77,630, com
pared with $62.KJ5.455 in November of last
year. Corn exports for tbe week rose a mil
lion bushels over those cf last week. The
effect of the strong financial showing made in
Ecutfcern Pacific's annual report was some
what m'^diStd upon the. minds of cpeculative
J old^re who had looked to dividend Â©respects,
r'v Â»be etress laid upon the importance of hold
i-jr"thÂ» resources of the company in reserve
r^ndlnir the effect of acgrressive buying of
c rrpetit've !inÂ«. The Â«rfect of the Rock
l-'and meetiac was also regarded with some
erprebensicn, as the belief was quite general
that the dividend on the preferred stock would
l',r. passed. The market became extremely Ir
*-ftrular in the latter part of the day and closed
vita movements much confused, but with
beÂ«t uric** considerably reduced. -

Butter, Cheese and Ksrcs.
Tha only change yesterday was in Esr^s,
which declined owing to signs of , increasing
supplies. Quite a number of dealers hitherto
carrying no stock of selected ranch had some
to sell and were willing to' let them go at
concessions to work, them > off. especially as
the weather was warmer, with indications of
rain, which were realized after the exchange
hour.' A warm., soaking rain now would alter

As usual on Friday, local trade in fresh
fruits was of a quiet routine character and
quotations showed but little change. - Large
sizes of Navel Oranges were flrmly held, being
in extremely light supply. The medium and
email sizes were abundant and in several in
stances buyers were able to shade the quota
tions for the latter. Mexican Limes, fancy
Lemons and big sizes or Grape Fruit ware
eteady. with stocks comparatively light, while
small Grape Fruit, seedling oranges, Tanger
ines and Japanese Mandarins were In free
supply and dull. - The situation in Apples was
unchanged. Fancy offerings of all varieties
were firmly held at stiff prices and a firmer
feeling prevailed among, holders of the lower
grades. A few cheats or Strawberries were
offering at easy prices, but found few buyers,
owing to the unattractWenesa of the fruit.
Cranberries were firm and a carload that ar
rived yesterday was held at -the flat rate of $18
per barrel. * '

Sydney yesterday, had about 6CCO boxes of
Oranges and more than 20tsO boxes of Lemons

PRISON HOLDS
TWO BROTHERS
T. Gilmore Anderson, Who Is
Wanted in Los Angeles on
Forgery Charges, Arrested
T. Gilmore Anderson, a cigar dealer,
was arrested yesterday morning by De
tectives Taylor and Braig and taken to
the City Prison. He is wanted in Los
Angeles on five charges of forgery. The
authorities there were notified of his ar
reat.
In JCovember, 1902, Anderson, who was
then 20 years of age, passed several fic
titious checks in this city and went to
Los Angeles. Detective Taylor was sent
there with a warrant for Anderson's ar
rest. Anderson was found in a hotel by
Detective Ritchie, from whom he broke
away. Ritchie fired three shots at him,
one of the bullets striking him on the leg.
He jumped into an excavation,, where he
was recaptured.
Taylor brought Anderson back to this
city, and owing to his youth and the fact
that his friends in the East had taken up
all of the fictitious checks the case was
placed by Judge Dunne on the reserve
calendar and Anderson allflwed to go on
probation.
It was discovered after Taylor left Los
Angeles with his prisoner that within an
hour one day Anderson had passed five
forged checks on five different merchants.
The authorities here were notified, but
through some blunder when Anderson
was released by Judge Dunne he was
not rearrested on the Los Angeles
charges. >
Anderson had left the city, and hia
whereabouts remained a mystery until
yesterday morning, when a note sent to
him by his brother, A. C. Anderson, who
is under arrest on suspicion of stealing a
diamond scarf pin, gave a clew to his ad
dress, whereupon Taylor and Braig ar
rested him. The scarf pin the brother is
suspected of stealing was taken from the
Olympic Club rooms and belonged to A.
W. Armstrong- of 530 Golden Gate avenue.
Charles Lyons, the London Tailor.

The petition of G. F. and H. X. Gray
of Gray Bros, for a writ of prohibition
to restrain Police Judge Fritz from
sentencing them under a conviction for
a violation of the order prohibiting
blasting within certain limits was de
nied yesterday by Judge Sloss and the
writ discharged. This means that the
brothers will be sentenced for their
violation of the law unless they can
defeat the case on habeas corpus before
the Supreme Court. *Â§'..\u25a0

Watchman Fills Costa Bica's
Hold Instead of Coast
er's Fresh Water Tank
The mistake of a night watchman
cauÃed a delay of twenty-four hours in
the departure of the San Francisco and
Portland Company's steamer Costa Rica
for the Columbia river and resulted in
damage <o cargo which will keep the
Harriman claim accnt at Portland busy
for some time to come. Incidentally, the
corporation will be a good round sum out
of pocket.
The. Costa Rica, formerly of the Pacific
Mail's Panama fleet but now running In
connection with the Columbia in place
of the St. Paul, was to have sailed on
Thursday morning. At 2 o'clock a. m. of
that day, the night watchman undertook,
as was Dart of his duty, to "fill the fresh
water tank with sparkling Sprink Valley.
Unscrewing the brass stopper from
what he supposed was the pipe leading
to tb<Â» watftr tank, he inserted the hose,
unscrewed the faucet and turned loosÂ© a
four-inch stream of water. The watch
man then went about the other duties
that Mr. Harriman's corporation had in
trusted to his care.
At 6 o'clock a. m. he concluded that the
water tank ought to be about full. ' He
sounded the tank well and was surprised
to rind no water there. He could hear
the water rushing through the hose/ He
knew it had been rushing unchecked for
four hours. Yet the sounding rod showed
an empty tank.
As he puzzled over the phenomenon
there came a voice from the engine
room.
. "Where in is that water coming
from?" â
And then the problem solved itself.
Instead of putting the hose .into the
aperture leading to the water tank, the
night watchman had opened. up the bilge
pipe and the four-inch stream of Spring
Valley had for four hours been pouring
its destroying dampness among the
pianos, groceries and other sensitive odds
and ends that made up the Costa Rica's
carso.
The water was turned off. A sounding
of the well showed six feet of water in
the hold. Pumps were rigged and in a
few minutes a stream of cargo-tainted
drinking water was pouring into the bay.
It was not deemed advisable to dis
charge the cargo, so the full extent of
the damage will not be known until the
freight is laid on the wharf at Portland
and the claims of the consignees all ad
justed.
The Costa Rica sailed yesterday
morning. â¢ >i : :^

HETEROGENEITY OF HASH
BRINGS GRIEF TO COOK
Railroad Tunnel Borers Object to Queer
Substances [Disked J TJp as Food.
CHEF GRIE VOUSLY WO UNDS AIDE
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
" Hash waÂ» the piece de resistance of
the dinner served to <, the men boring" a
Southern Pacific tunnel at South San
Francisco, and no sooner did they ex
plore ,it than they rose eh ; masse and
pronounced it ultra miscellaneous. ; -
"While variety may be the spice of
life," quoth one critic, holding ; forth
for the* inspect jon; of Mb fellows an
infant's well-worn shoe, which he had
extracted from; the contents of his
plate, "variety can be overdone in the
matter of hash." .
"If "you eat that stuff you'll feel like
everything," ! said the wit of the j gang
to a comrade who was ruefully survey
ing his allotment of the steaming mess.
; Grim silence rebuked the joke,; but
failed to crush the joker."- Fishing a
leather glove from | his platter, : he
plaintively complained,: "If a stingy
corporation -wasn't running this com
missary ' department -there'd be a pair
o' these things in this plate."
When -the : promptly appointed | com
mittee laid- its grievance and samples
of the- hash before Chief Cook Frank J.
Martin he . sidestepped \u25a0 responsibility
for the heterogeneous quality of the
viand, stating that its preparation had
been entirely entrusted -to his next in
command, Frank ;Elllott.-:; Elllott. - : "When I in
structed Frank to make hash." said
Mr. Martin, :"I : expected that he would
confine- the components, to left-over
meat and ;other second-hand grub. If
It had occurred to me that he imagined
he Was told t6 sweep up the camp and
book thfe sweepihgi I .woiild have cor
rected his error. However, he shall
be reproved." / ,' \u0084- *
Mr. Elliott warmly resented the re
proof which Mr.' Martin 'sought to ad
minister. "Hashis hash," he contend
ed, "an" folks that are; so dumgasted
particular about what -their; hash is
made of shouldn't tackle hash at = all.'-'
"Conceding that hash. Is hash." the
chef rejoined, "haÂ«h ; intended ; for\ hu
man consumption should .not Include
hardware and' camp -furniture and
cast-off articles of clothing. â¢ There's
a- limit to most things, and the. compo
sition of hash is one of ; 'em."
Thus, to quote. Mr. Elliott's state
ment to""Pollce Judge Mogan,! "one word
borryed another" until Mr. ', Martin
picked up a- meat cleaver and violently
swung its sharp-edge against his sub
ordinate's head, inflicting, a wound
both dieep and dangerous. .. >
The charge lagainst Mr.. Martin was
that of having 'committed an assault
with a deadly weapon, but the defense
claimed that as it was' a â¢\u25a0: .whetstone,
and not a cleaver,- with which said as
saiilt was committed.^ the, weapon
could not reasonably V be ; classified ;as
"deadly"" and" therefore the 'complaint
was defective. " Mr. Elliott,'^ whose head
was encased in a thick bandage, of
fered to prove *by Surgical
that his wound could not; have been
made by such a blunt- Instrument as a
whetstone and he'was given until this
morning to bringr in .the t ' gentlemen of
science who, dressed..' the!: cranial injury.

Mrs. Ella Hickey's face and voice were
expressive; of both anger : and determina
tion when; she poised aloft a heavy sugar
bowl and threatened to hurl it at a mas
culine waiter's head, which was, directly
in front of " her and only a , few feet i dis :
tant. Smiling derisively, he requested her
to "flre ( .away,',' and then hastily supple
mented'the" request with an "admonition to
the folk behind ; her .V. to be - prepared , to
dodge when the bowl left her hand. Nor
did he flinch, when she executed her
threat to the ' extent of projecting the
bowl, but seemed to be sincerely alarmed
for the safety of the people he had
warned. Fortunately the missile hit the
ceiling almost directly over Mrs. Hickey's
head,' and she was deluged with sugar
and crockery fragments. \u25a0 , â¢â¢'â¢
"You ; are; either phenomenally fearless
or reckless . to> a fault," said. Judge Ca

"No, I ain't eyether,". was tlje response,
"but I've seen ray wife throw rocks at
her chickens.". .
It was in John Mortegea's restaurant,
211 Eddy street.: that Mrs. Hlckey dis
turbed the peace and smashed the j sugar
bowl. The provoking cause of her disor
derly behavior was variously explained
to the court, the lady averring that never
in : all' her; life had she been treated 'with
such outrageous discourtesy as was dis
played by the cafe attaches, while , they
unanimously swore that,she was .trucu
lently inebriated^ As she did not seem to
be. responsible for what she said or did,
they added, and as a person in her condi-,
tion was not desirable: as a patron any
way, her requests to be served with food
were ignored, the object being to induce
her to depart the| shop after she became
wearied of giving" orders which brought
no response. It was to compel the atten
tion of the waiter hereinbefore .alluded to
that "she attempted to menace ..him -with"
the sugar bowl. , -
, "I. ain't no reg'lar rounder," said ; the
lady to the Judge, "an' if ye let me go
I'll pay for all I broke."
"Sometimes a volunteer rounder is as
bad as a regular," his Honor remarked,
"but you don't seem to be- even, an en
thusiastic \u25a0 volunteer. Your, proposal -is

PEACE IN
STREET CAR
SITUATION
United Railroads Plan :to
Anticipate the Demands of
I Men by New Time Schedule
: Giving ifem Satisfaction
REASONABLE .MI^OFF,
; AT THE^tMMMALS
Fear of : Strike r Allayed and;
Further /Revision of the
Routes to Be Agreeable to
"the Public, V Officers Say?
The street-car situation, which was.,
tense : and â¢ promising of war. Thursday*
night after the 1 meeting of the Carmen's'
Union, relaxed ' yesterday. 'The dove of
peace Is t>Qsy. : - It seems that the r United
Railroads, " very -dextrously and grace
fully, are preparing^ to anticipate the de-;
mand of â¢ their men and to _ change the^
tipe- schedules which are the source, of,
the threatened trouble.'.
"At a late hour last night the resolu
tions, of the ,. carmen, with their cate-^i
gorical demand; for a change of the time
tables, \ had not 'been presented to ~any- :
of the 'officers of the company." But;al-^
ready the company,', whether spontane
ously or spurred by the news of the
meeting Thursday night, were preparing'
changes which they say will satisfy both
the car", men- and ; the public. - ' y '-
fcjj H. Handlbn, : . the chief clerk of the
United ; and the .spokesman of
Manager 'Chaprnan/'said last night that
the new arrangement of routes had de
veloped some faults which would be rem
edied by further, changes, and that these
changes would be -calculated so as to give
the men a reasonable time of rest at the
end of each round trip.- That- this rea
sonable time would be . the ; five minutes
demanded by theY car men he did not
say, but : he emphasized' the word "rea
sonable." '\u25a0 } \u25a0 ; \u25a0 \u25a0*.i.3:".^ :
What is reasonable to the officers of the
company and what is reasonable to the
men that work, the cars may differ, sev
eral degrees, but it seems .probable that
a\ satisfactory compromise will,' be
reached.
"The new. schedules," said Mr. Hand
lon, ."were made necessary by the new
routes created, and these new routes
were 'instituted to > give the public more
direct and efficient service. -By the new
arrangement, for instance, jj the public of
the . Masonic-avenue line; of \u25a0 the Eight
eenth-street \u25a0 Twin Peak line and of ' the
San Bruno lines are given direct j service
into the heart of the' city, something
which they did. not have, and which they
wished. The new routes, however, seem
to have confused the publlcr with the re
sult of friction and a slowing up of the
traffic. Under, these conditions It has
been decided to revise our new schedules.
To-morrpw and Monday revised schedules
will go into effect, and all schedules will
be revised in the course of a 'few days.
We are surethat'the final changes, will
be agreeable to the public. The new
schedule will* also allow the carmen, a
reasonable time at terminals." \u25a0
â¢When asked what the reasonable time
allowed the men at terminals would be,
Mr. Handlon was unable to give a defi
nite answer. He said that the whole mat
ter was a very complicated one. but Was
being deeply, studied. He was inclined to
think, however, that the: fixed five min
utes , demanded â¢by the carmen at the
outer terminals was impracticable, on
some of the lines, especially on those
such as the ferry lines, running, a great
number of cars | at close" intervals.
-It is evident that- the United Railroads
do not mean to be inflexible in the matter
and that the men of the cars will: be met
half way. Their grievances, in fact, may
be remedied before they present the reso
lutions voicing them.
The San Francisco Labor Council, at a
meeting^held last night, passed resolu
tions giving the carmen of this city assur
ance of their; sympathy and. moral sup
port in their fight against the new sched
ules. â¢\u25a0 In .addition" the resolutions pledge
the council to oppose the granting of any
new franchises |or -the extension of old
ones to railroad companies. ..'-'. ":'.;;*

Frank Freeman Gets Posses
sion of Money- at Shop of
William Kelm"by Kuse
Frank Freeman, a butcher residing at
1143 Mission street, entered the butcher
shop of William A. Kelm, 1655 Mission
street, yesterday, afternoon and after giv
ing the proprietor 10 cents and telling him
ito buy a drink, .walked away with the
money sack which had been left outside
the cash register and which contained be
tween $70 and $75. He then paid several
bills and took his wife and son to the
Alcazar for an evening of pleasure, but
was arrested and charged with grand
larceny before the play was over.
When Kelm returned from buying the
drink Freeman was gone and shortly af
terward the money, was "missed from the
register. J. C. Christie, the. clerk in the
shop, was immediately called and ad
mitted that he had carelessly left the bag
lying on the counter.
The police were notified and Detective
T. P. Riordan was detailed on the case.
Riordan soon located his man at the Al
cazar Theater with his wife aJfd aon and
placed him under arrest. Freeman then
confessed his guilt and produced several
receipted bills and $32 50. He explained to
Riordan that he had been out of em
ployment for; some time and urfpald bills
were beginning to worry him consider
ably and when this opportunity . afforded
itself, he thought only, of the unpaid bills
and not of what might follow. After the
bills were â¢ paid, he he would
give his wife and son an evening of pleas
ure and purchased three gallery seats at
the 'Alcazar. Tha'; evening was marred,
however, by his arrest, which occured be
fore, the entertainment was over.
Freeman was identified at. the Hall of
Justice, by Christie and booked for grand
larceny. Ac \u25a0 Christie was leaving thÂ«
prison/, he pulled a revolver from his
pocket and \ remarked to Riordan that he
"guessed - there was no use; in carrying it
loaded -any longer," as his man was be
hind the. bars. Riordan- immediately took
charge : of the gun and arrested Christie
for,carrying a concealed*. weapon. He was
later released on $23 bail.
