ST. PETERSBURG, Dec liâ Two
messengers who arrived here from
Xlisa to-day, bavins walked about 150
miles to catch a train at Poloclc, not
only conflrm the report that a IÂ»ro

troops have cone over to the Insurrec

The messengers add that the Provis

throughout Livonia and part of Cour
land. The nevs- Government has de
clared the separation of the Lithua
nian people from the Russian Empire.
They have chosen new local officials
end" have decreed the closings of the
spirit shops and breweries and the an
nulment of contracts between the
peasants and the land-owners.
There is a general rising of the na

majority are fleeing In terror. The
peasants forbid the owners to sell
frr.-ui or lumber, and formally declare
that the forests and estates of those
â¢who have departed will be confiscated.
RISSIAX OFFICIALS EXPELLED.
The position of the peasants in these
provinces has been the most deplor
able of any hi the entire empire. Con
ditions almost approaching those of
the feudal system have been continued
down to the present time. They prac
tically have kept the peasants in a
Etate of vassalage, placing them at the
mercy of the German Barons from
whom they rent land and purchase the
right to cut wood and fish in the waters
of the gulf.
The Russian officials are being ex
prllrd from the provinces and many of
them have been killed in the streets

There is a reign of terror at Riga.
"Women and children are living in the

merchants are closing up their business
or abandoning everything in order to

It is doubtful whether the local self- :
government contained in to-day's im

least for the present, but it furnishes
ample proof that the Government real

Details of the Duquesne
Club Dinner to Be
Revealed.
Noted Names Linked With
Those of Anna Held and

Special Dispatch to The Call.
PITTSBURG, Dec. 13. â W. Ellis
Corey, president of the United States
Steel Corporation, is in Pittsburg and
very busy, though in a quiet way. He
reached here yesterday and went into
seclusion at the Duauesne Club, meet
ing only a few close friends. He has
made several short trips from the club
on "private business," according to
friends who have seen him.
If an effort be made to depose Corey
from the head of the steel combine
there will be trouble and lots of it. To
get ammunition for this trouble -has
been the object of his visit to Pitts
burg â that and the silencing of J. ; B.
Corey, his uncle, who has threatened
through 'the public press to divulge
something rich and rare regarding the
case of his nephew and the steel trust.
President Corey promises to take ,a
hand himself in "showing up" certain
residents of Pittsburg and New York
j If he be pressed and if there "be dan- <
. jrrr ;Â«f, nirr -bMnÂ«r=> .force* "c E fr<pjfÂ«"; i if
*10Â«,000 job because of;hW Yamlly.'troa*
bles. lie, according to friends >.who '
have talked with . him, proposes to
make it rather warm for many, ' in-J
eluding H. C. Frlck. by laying bare the*
hitherto. unwritten history of a certain
dinner at the Duquesne Club, years ago;
also the inside workings of Cassie
Chadwick with Pittsburg millionaires
â all this if he be forced to do so to
save his job.
Last week there arrived from New
York two smooth-looking, easy-work
ing persons, who set on foot a shrewd
inquiry about the 'Trick dinner" of
seven or eight years ago at the Du
quesne Club, the full history of which
was never printed, and which. ac
cording to the Corey people, nover !
reached the outside world. Anna Held, <
who had been given $500 to sing at
the dinner, however, reached the out
side world that night through a win
dow or a back door In a rather "be
draggled state and in tears.
Those in the confidence of W E.
Corey here declare that he knows of
this dinner and that the doings there
would have put to shame the innocent
little dinner given by Corey to Miss
Gilman at the seashore a year or 'so
ago. and that the names of the guests
at the Pittsburg dinner and their do
ings may be made public to good ad
vantage. .
The story of the > Duquesne Club
dinner, as made public at the time-was
that in her abbreviated stage costume
Miss Held had started to sing her fa
vorite little song. "Oh. Won't You
Come and Play With Me," when some
thing happened. Some of the guests, it
appears, showed a desire to accept the
tuneful invitation literally and the
song was never finished, for Miss Held
was rescued by her manager and
rushed from the club.
The manager started to raise a row
afterward, but was quieted in some
way and no more than the foregoing
facts were ever made public. Corey's
friends claim, however, that there were
other and more startling facts, others
besides Anna Held to entertain and
names and Incidents that would make
rich reading.
< T Â£f* , adventur Â«s of Cassie Chadwick
in Pittsburg are being looked up by
those connected with Corey and this
may be another reason for asking that
certain' people do not press Corey so
that he will have to resign. That
there were others besides James W
Friend In the toils of Cassie, but that
they fought their way-out, has been
frequently alleged here and If any O ne
knows all about Jt It Is Corey He ac 1
I cording to his friends, is ready to 'talk
if he has to. to save his job.
"All Mr. Corey asks is to be let
; alone," said one of his friends to-night.

Southern Pacific Is
.to Build a New
Line.
Plans to Run Electric

to San Jose.
Old Corporation Arranging

Scecial DlSDatch to The Call.
SAN MATEO, Dec. 13.â There is now
no longer any question that the South
ern Pacific Company has decided, not
only to connect San Francisco and San
Jose with an electric railroad, but that
it will give battle to the Ocean Shore
Railway for an equal share of the rich
patronage that is to come from the
coast district between San Francisco
and Santa Cruz. When' the. Ocean
Shore Railway developed into some
thing very much more substantial' than
a project it' was thought': that the
Southern Pacific had let slip a golden
opportunity and that it had lost -the
entire trade of that section of the coast
which tor many years had been beg
ging for transportation facilities.
It is clear now, however, that the
officials of the Southern Pacific have
not been caught napping. Thty have
already surveyed a route for, an elec
tric railroad;, from San Mateo to San
Jose., and. they have also found an easy
avenue? oti;- access : to '^the ] coast' ; upon
KSXi*, *"' ;'ftTtxJtA^T. t Jfj-scyjirt i^m a y : <\u25a0 be *x> p^t ;
ated.Tiq^ advantage. V'l'hctiiioyernents of
the company, in ;securlngr the necessary
rights of way. and in making- surveys
have been quietly, almost secretly,
made, but observers who are also in
the confidence of the company, have
said enough to expose the plans of,tnÂ«
railroad builders. .-
ROUTE IS SELECTED.
William F. Herrin has given his per-
Eonal attention to the" matter^ and in
company with H. H. " Lynch, who di
rected the construction of the San Ma
teo electric railroad, has -gone over, the
ground and has given his -Indorsement,
it is announced, to the route selected.
Surveyors have been in the field for
some time and the route has â¢ been
agreed upon. The road as now planned
will leave San Mateo for the south at
a point not yet determined. The road
will -run through the Hay ward prop
erty, which for many years has been a
barrier ' to progress in that direction.
The route will be up to the Hay ward
home.
At that point the county road will be
crossed and the route will be main
tained through the property of An
tone Borel and others westerly until
the foothills are reached, at the ex
treme west of the Murray ranch at
Laurel Creek. That point on. the new
road will be a most important one in
connection with the tapping of the en
tire coast-side district.
" From the Murray ranch the road will
take its way through a pass in 1 the
mountains back of the Mills ranch.
The road will continue in that direction
until it emerges at Belmont near the
site of the Reid school. The old Ala
meda de las Pulgas, , which is back of
San Carlos and near. the Brittan ranch,
will then be followed. In that direc
tion the road "will take a practically
straight course until it skirts the west
erly "boundary of ;Wellesley Park. At
that point the way, will be clear to
meet the railroad which Is now build
ing from Santa Clara to a point on the
grounds of the f Stanford University
west of the main buildings. Here the
connection will be made, and the elec
tric railroad from Santa Clara to San
Mateo will be complete.
SEVERAL, SURVEYS MADE.
- While several/ surveys have been
made, the one outlined is the one that
has been : chosen. Stakes have been
driven and the expectation ; is .tnat ac
tual work on the road will, not long be
delayed. \u25a0'-' Property, owners are being
approached yin reference -to rights of
way and all the necessary preliminaries
seem to have been arranged.
. TheÂ« point at ; which the coast-side
district-is" to be tapped-is at. the Murray
ranch, where r the avenue;, to the coast
is comparatively -an easy one through
the Laurel Creek \u25a0 canyon. grade
is not a heavy one and an ejectrlc rail
road may be operated on it without
great difficulty. - This .will give, to the
Southern Pacific. Company an entrance
to the rich district which is now the
objective point: of the Ocean Shore
Railroad. . :

Soccial Dispatch to The ' Call,
' NEW YORK, Dec. 13.â Abraham M.
Hummell, the attorney, was placed on
trial to-day before Justice Rogers in
the criminal branch of the .Supreme
Court on the charge of conspiracy and
subornation of perjury in "connection
with the Dodge-Morse divorce case,' and
when court adjourned- this afternoon
only four jurors had been selected.
Counsel for the accused lawyer made
an effort to have the trial delayed, but
Justice Rogers overruled all thu vari

Tile ; conspiracy; and perjury charges
were made* after an 'Investigation by
District 'Attorney/ Jerome of -allegations
that "the courts ; had been . made use "of
in an Improper manner in'an effort to
procure an annulment of the decree , of
divorce obtained 'by Mrs. Clements
Dodge, a former California girl, n gainst
Charles F. Dodge. After, this divorce
Mrs. Dodge was married to ' Charles W.
Morse, a- capitalist of this city, who
is. prominent- in- banking and .business
affairs. The real object of the desire
to obtain* an annulment of the Dodge
divorce was; said : to -be to thereby in
validate the marriage of, Mrs. Dodge
and '-.*\u25a0 :'??,
Why it was sought to invalidate this
marriage has never been definitely
learned, but the most sensational 'stories
have" been in circulation on the, subject,
the most persistent- being that a declara
tion of invalidity instead of -a divorce
was desired in order that another mar
riage might take place- with a wealthy
member of the Roman Catholic church
under the rites of that church.
Hummell appeared in the proceedings
as attorney for Charles F. Dodge and pre
sented a claim by . Dodge" that he never
was properly served with the summons in
Mrs. Dodge's suit, that he was not repre
sented by -counsel at the trial and that
he knew nothing of ; the- matter until he
was Berved with a certificate of "the. de
cree. :
Former. Justice Fursman then came into
the case as counsel for Mrs. Morse, and
the legal proceedings; continued up to the
point where, on . January 4, 1904, the
Dodge-Morse annulment was entered In
the Supreme Court. Then an attorney
nemed " Sweetser, who had served' . the
papers on .Dodge and .who . had- been at
.work on the case to save his professional
reputation.; discovered letters from podge
to . Portlmer, Ruger, also an ', attorney,
saying Dodge, had been served with pa
pers In a divorce suit and authorizing
Ruger to act as his attorney. Ruger had
died before the latter proceedings.' .
Dodge was at once indicted' for. perjury,
and after, a long, and ; bitter legal ' battle
was brought -back from Houston,' Tex. A
member of Hummell's law firm repre
sented Dodge in Texas :In .his efforts ..to
prevent extradition' to New York. "After
Dodge. was brought back here' he made
a statement In ".which" he accused Hum
mell of having dictated 'to him' the i false
affidavit. He; said he: had been ;plenti
fully supplied with, money, the source of
which ahe did not ' question, ; and that _ all
the efforts to prevent his return to New
rYork were " made under the direction of
Hummell.

Behind the. death. of John Rush Baird, the young clubman who was killed by

automobile on Carmel road at : midnight
on Tuesday death carried with It a
double tragedy. It brought to a sorrow
ful end a. pretty secret romance between
the young capitalist and Miss Ruby
Brown Neil, his companion on that fatal
ride. Baird fell desperately In. love, with
her three months ago, so the story goes,
and his wooing had been successful. They
had nurtured- their love for each other
quietly arid kept it secret from the peer-
Ing eyes of the public. The. marriage
was to have been celebrated soon after
the beginning of the new year, and it
.was to have been made a surprise to the
many friends of both.
The story iof the \u25a0; romance was told
brokenly to Chief of Detectives Burnett
yesterday by Miss Nell, -who 'was \u25a0 called
before him to give a detailed account of
the accident. /Her \ eyes Â» filled with tears
as she' told of the; death, of Balrd, and a
soft blush : overspread her cheeks when
she said, "We loved each other and were
to' have been married 'soon." A Â« hush fell
on v the newspaper men and .detectives
standing about the room, when she ; told
of their secret wooing, for they realized
that they .had i touched the saddest chord
of the , ;\u25a0 tragedy. Down deep In their
hearts they pitied the ,- Woman. , and : every
man of them believed what she said.
CRIED OUT IX HER ANGUISH.
What wonder, then,! that this brave lit

she saw the : automobile turn over and

What wonder that she tugged desperately
at the powerful machine in " her : frantic

NEW YORK, Dec. 13. â It was stated
on good authority. ' to-day that . all
Trunk Line: Association railroads have
agreed to abolish * all forms of free
transportation" after, January 1- This
step is the, natural consequence of the
announcement ,* made .by the Pepnsyl

systems ' that . they will ' no \u25a0 longer dis
tribute passes. It Is expected that the
Western roads will follow suit before
the meeting of representatives, of the
Trunk Line Association in this city to
morrow.
Of all the roads entering this city.. it
Is. generally. .understood that the, Ce
ntral, .the. Erie and. the .Ontario: .and
Western have been, the mostUavlsh dis
tributors of free transportation. . Offi
cials of the Erie practically, admit that
the management of r the road "has de
cided to abandon the custom.
r In, addition, to, the I, roads mentioned,
the /abolition of the pass system will
be indorsed by the Lackawanna. the
Lehigh Valley, the Baltimore and Ohio,
the "Jersey*. Central, the West' Shore, the
Delaware Tand Hudson and other con
trolled and affiliated lines.*
. ': While -this ' determination' upon the
part* of the railway officials has been
Influenced by the continued agitation in

Human "Steam!"
: Keeping it Up
This Is The Secret of That S emihgr-
!y Tireless Energy Possessed
by Some People.
There is another kind of steam than
that In which the boy James Watt,
-watching his mother's tea-kettle, first
saw the great possibilities that lons
elnrc have become realities.
This other kind of steam is human
''etcam." And it is a most important
factor In our afiialrp.
. Some people call this human "steam"
by other names. They call it 'push
sometimes, or "hustle," or "get-tip." or
-life." Well, it's all of these, but after*
all it's Just "steam." It's the powei
to do things â a seemingly tireless
power which some people possess.
.; You can c.-ill to your mind right thin
minute somo men and women, boys anÂ«l
ijirls. perhaps, who always go about
their work or play "with full steam
\u25a0up." They can accomplish more and do
thinjfs bolter than other people. It>
their "steam" that gives them increased
power.
f Malta-Vita, the perfect malted whole-
wheat food, fills men and women and
children with the power to do things.
It ir.ak*B them strong: in body and
jnind. It keeps up their â¢â¢steam."
When Malta-Vita comes from the
ovens, every flake baked crisp and
brown, it isthe most delicious and most
healthful food In the world, containing
only one per cent of moisture. The
01 her 99 per cent is nutrition. And all
tliis nutrition is digested most readily.
*yen by the weakest stomach, because
the gelatinized starch of the thorough-
ly cooki d wheat has been converted by
line malt extract into maltose, or malt
sugar. nS^9
: And Malttf-Yita is so good to eat!
There's no other lood like it; none "just
as good"; none that can take Its place.

Emperor and Grand

Quarrel
Eye-Witness Tells
of Tarskoe-Selo
Episode.
Soeclal Dlepatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Dec. 13.â The Dally News
publishes a St. Petersburg cablegram
dated yesterday, as follows:
"From an eye witness the corre
spondent of the Daily News has "ob
tained an authentic account of the In
cidents which recently gave rise to the
report that the Czar had been wounded
in a personal encounter with Grand
Duke Boris.
"On Thursday, November 30," says
this informant, "the Czar ordered that
from his private purse an asylum be
built for the orphans of the victims
of 'bloody Sunday,' when many peace
ful workingmen were shot down by
troops In St. Petersburg. Grand Duke
Vladimir, who was in chief command
of the troops, regarded this as a per
sonal slur upon him. The same day
Vladimir's son. Grand Duke Boris, re
proached the Cxar for having; sacri
liced family interests for his own po
litical Interests, adding: 'The Grand
Dukes are now ruined.'
"The Czar replied that the misman
agement and malfeasance of the Grand
Dukes, together wfth the notoriously
scandalous lives they led. had brought
about the present troubles, while
Grand Duke Vladimir's, order to the
troops on January 22 last to shoot
down worklngmen under Father Ga
pon's leadership had precipitated and
was the actual cause of the revolution.
"Grand Duke Boris retorted angrily,
calling the Czar a backboneless crea
ture. Thereupon Grand Duke Michael,
the Czar's brother, who was present,
struck Boris. The latter, in a furious
rage, drew his sworfl, but Grand Duke
Nicholas, who has succeeded Grand
Duke Vladimir at the head of the St.
Petersburg 1 garrison, stopped the me
lee.
"The â¢ matter ended by Grand Duke
Boris being ordered out of Russia."
STRIKERS FIGHT COSSACKS.

MOSCOW, Tuesday, December 12. â A
veritable panic prevails on the Bourse.
The complete collapse of business in
the provinces has been attended by
many bankruptcies.
The agrarian disturbances are ex
tending almost to the gates of this
city. The country mansions of many
nobles have been burned.
Strikers fought with a Cossack band
in the outlying industrial village of
Gorcditch. The strikers stood their
ground with revolvers, emptying fonr
saddles and forcing the Cossacks to
retreat.
The Workrilen's Council of Moscow
has adhered to the decision of "the SC
Petersburg Council in deciding against
a general strike. The Council's funds

At the same time the Government
recognizes that crushing the growing
rebellion by force will not sufflceand
that some sort of local self-government
will alone quiet the population. There
fore It has ordered- the convocation of
representatives of various classes of
the provinces, including the peasants,
to work out a scheme for the creation
of "a Zemstvo to control local affairs.
The workmen's council yesterday
sent a demand to Count de Witte for
the release of Krustaleff, its leader.
Later the workmen's delegates called
on Procurator Kamishansky ; and de
manded his release, but the Procurator
refused bluntly, saying that the case
must be tried in court. To this the
spokesman of the delegation replied:
"Then we will declare a general
strike." " l
"I will not release him if the whole
world strikes," answered the Procura
tor.
Krustaleff is understood to be im
prisoned in the St. Peter and St. Paul
fortress in order, it Is said, to prevent
any possible attempt at rescue, which
would only lead" to bloodshed.
The disappearance of the danger of a
general strike seems to' assure the Gov
ernment a certain period in which to
vindicate itself and demonstrate that it
is striving tc establish the new order
of things, and if, as its friends hope, it
will be able to show this by deeds it
will cut away public sympathy from
the proletariat and place the work
men's organization, when the \ time
comes lor a strike, in the attitude of
deliberately provoking a struggle. to
overthrow the Government and estab
lish a democratic republic.
HAS FAITH IN THE ARMY.
De "Witter Says Great Mass of Troops
Will Remain Loyal.
LONDON, Dec. 14.â The correspondent
of the Daily Telegraph at St. Petersburg,
in a further installment of his interview
with Count de Witte^ the first part of
which was published on Tuesday, says
the Premier declared that the army would
remain faithful; that the finances of the
country were sound and that it was not
his Intention to resign.
The correspondent, in a series of ques
tions, 'presented ' numerous instances" of
the disloyalty of the troops and sailors.
The Premier, answering these questions,
insisted that In all cases the disloyalty
so pointed out was either temporary or
exceptional, and that it had never devel
oped into actual infidelity to the Em
peror. It could be denied/ he said,
that the revolutionary propaganda was
being"/ Industriously^ "amlrr assiduously
worked In the army and in the navy, but
it was not and could not be successful,
because theoiatlonal character^ was. fixed?
arid the national traditions .were;. tod deep,
rooted. So far as he knew, the ' de
mands of the malcontents were alto
gether of an amicable character. The
iroopa were accustomed to obey the Em
peror implicitly, and the Premier was
unable to conceive any transference of
that allegiance.
The correspondent suggested the possi
bility of a sudden "coup by which the
Republicans would seize the reins of gov
ernment, to which Count de Witte replied
that the members of such; a party , would
be ruthlessly cut down by the imperial
troops. The idea' of such a republican
government existing for even three days,
the Premier - said, could be entertained
only by foreigners who had never had an
opportunity to study the Russian national
character, or by thoughtless Russians,
who were incapable of interpreting that
character.
â¢'Russian national life." said Count de
' Witte, "is pivoted on loyalty to the Em-.
j peror, and how deep-rooted and ' wide
! spread and fruitful is this principle will
be seen if the revolutionists should be
foolhardy enough to build upon a con
trary assumption.*'

BOSTON, Dec. 13.â Leon Jacob Zloro
tln, an educated Russian Jew, -who has'
arrived here from Odessa, iaya that 15,-,
000 Jews were killed there In three
days, with most horrible mutilation and
torture. Cossacks and police aided the ;

i women and children were among; < the
victims. 'â¢ '\u25a0
t Zlorotin, with his wife and nine-year
1 old daughter, escaped by night from
| Odessa. They reached Libau by train,
where they took ship for ' Liverpool,
thence coming to New York and Boston.
He attributes his escape to the fact, that
i he bears little resemblance to a Jew., Of
hla experiences he said:
"On November 15 I was in my house,
when a murmur arose as if from a mob.;
My wife and girl and myself .waited, and :
expected' every minute that the mob'
would break into our home and kill us.,
We looked out of the window and saw,
children thrown from the tops of,: build-,
ings, and then, after the mothers',' ears;
or noses were cut off, they were alsoi
thrown to * their death. v \ v : ' .
. . rOLICE DIRECT THE MOBS. w
"The police had changed their uniforms:
for civilian dress and went around with;
the* Cossacks and Christian rndbsTandi
pointed out the houses of the Jews. "Alii
of the Jewish people ran to their cellars,
and were afraid to go out into the streets.
As it grew dark I took my wife and child.
1 and went into the street. All-around
were bodies of our people, some \ d ylng. :
and In various parts of the city- soldiers,
were killing more people: '"Altogether;
there were 15,000 Jews killed in three |
days'. ,-.â¢â¢.'\u25a0; =\u25a0.. \u25a0; \u25a0 -â¢
"Nobody in the mob took me for a Jew, , :
so I; was able to pass through the crowd.
1 left all my property behind me; having
only $180, and took a carriage. ; . . ; - \u25a0
"The students and Jews" could have pro
tected thmeselves, If 'lt-had not been 'for
the interference of the ' Cossacks. "One
man, with his familyof slx.dhildren, was
taken into the street,; and,, after. the chil
dren were killed in front:' of their father,
the mob made the father'^ut,on the talix
(a shroud used by the > orthodox -Jews
when praying) and made him kneel down""
and pray while they put him to death...
"After passing all these terrible sights
we tried to gret a train to St. Petersburg,
but there was none running there.'so we
boarded one for Libau-x"-: ;... ," ',\u25a0-\u25a0'
"On the train we heard o^- terrible atro

"There occurred he're>the 4nost terrible
scenes. There are 30,000 families that
paved absolutely nothing -but the clothing
oil their backs and are ''now huddled to
gether In .the open streets. There were
20,000 wounded and 15.Q00 murdered. Li t
tle.children were hurled out of windows

"On October 17 a manifesto came from
St. Petersburg, giving.us a constitution.

"But on the same night mobs . congre
gated on, the outskirts;. of: the. city and
started to beat the Jews. On the follow
ing day a crowd of marauders, with the
assistance of the police, started to 'march
through the streets, with the national
flag and Ikons of the church and also the
Czar's portrait. As they went they cried,
'Bey Szidov,' meaning 'Beat the Jews.' ,
JEWS HORRIBLY TORTURED.
"After they sang and yelled they threw
stones at the houses and destroyed homes
In the center of the j city. If any Jews
were found. in the streets they, were hor
ribly : tortured ' and murdered "â¢" outright.
Houses were robbed one after the other
and the large stores and warehouses were
pillaged.
"In one word, it looked like a veritable
and awfql war. Merchandise was carried
away from the stores in great loads. The
doors : and windows of homes and build
ingsn gs \u25a0of all kind s were broken in , and we
all thought we would be'kllled. . \u25a0
"On account of these deathly scenes I
am too weak to give you anything like a:
true description. All I can ; tell you Is
that we are all Bick from the happenings
and our nerves cannot bear it any longer.
This same story *we hear from all \u25a0 the

Little more developed : as to the acci
dent. : The -' car turned over on Carmel
road just below the 'water, tank. Baird
found that the machine could not make
the ascent and had started, down again.
It seems that the steering gear was out
of, order. At one spot he/ barely missed
going over the . embankment. The ma
chine was completely j .wrecked; Miss
Neil .told clearly every detail of the acci
dent and. of the trip from the time that
they left San Mateo. Th?y had had trou
ble-with the brakes and the steering gear
all the: afternoon, and had made nearly
fifty stops to, fix defec.ts. At the time of
the accident she had . stepped from the
machine to .push, it enough to' enable
them to ! coast | down .the . hill. "Suddenly
it started from me," she said, "and in a
moment^t had run up. the bank and over
turned." . .. - v- - '<\u25a0'. \u25a0â¢â¢- :

aaddened yesterday and plainly showed
the awful strain under which she has la
bored since the V tragedy. She left her
room at the -Princeton shortly after
reaching it yesterday . morning, she ex
plained, and walked the .streets in her
anguish. At noontime she tried to eat,
could not and then returned to . the
Princeton. There Detective T. ;J. Bailey
found her and took her' before Captain
Burnett.
According to the girl's own story, she
was born- in San Francisco, her parents
died long ago and she .was then taken
Into the home of Mr. and Mrs. E.rD. Neil
of Sonora. There sle lived until nearly
a year ago, when she came to. San Fran
cisco to work.' She. found employment in
Tilmas* studio, where she met Baird. It
was, she confessed, a case of love at first
sight, and he- soon won her promise to
marry him. He did not wish her to work
longer, so he placed her in the Prince
ton. Not a soul knew of the engagement,
although the two. were together much of
the time. .

quiring that he be "publicly reprimand
ed by the Secretary of the Navy." Sec
retary Bonaparte has addressed the
following- letter to Midshipman Meri

\u25a0 Sir: . Youhave been 'duly, convicted. of vio
lating clause three of article -VIII of the,ar

Insulting and subsequently assaulting- on* of
your fellow-midshipmen and of conduct to the
prejudice of good order and discipline by en
raging in a . flstflght , with . the same midship
man. These offenses on your part have led
to a calamity sio clearly unforeseen by you
and ' so distressing that no words of reproach
can be needed to make you feel their gravity.
Tour disobedience to the laws of your coun
try, your forgetfulness of the full import ot
your oath, your yielding to fiery and angry
passions when tempted by a sense of. wrong
have borne fruits so bitter that your worst
punishment has been already suffered. The
merciful sentence of the court which tried
you leaves ypu a member of the honorable pro
fession you have chosen. In that great school
of self-sacrifice and obedience a life useful to
your country will, it is hoped, atone for grave
faults which have clouded the early years
of your service.
You will acknowledge receipt of this letter
and It will be entered on your official record.

HIS CONTEST
Ballot-Box Case Decided
in Favor of McClellan by
New York Appellate Court
[ALBANY, N. V., Dec. 13. â The court
of Appeal?, in a decision handed down
to-day in the New York City ballot-box
case, sustains the contention of counsel
for Mayor McClellan and denies that

The courts have, no" power,' under the
election law to order by mandamus the
opening of the ballot-boxes and a re

Of the' utmost importance in Hearst's
contest for the Mayoralty of New York
City and is fundamental in its effect
upon the electoral system of this State.
The decision was rendered by a di
vided court, five to two, the majority
comprising Chief Judge Cullen and
Judges Gray. O'Brien. Haight and \VÂ«r v
rer. Judges Bartlett and Vain dis
eemÂ«>d.
The pist of the majority opinion is
that the courts are "without power or
authority to order a rreount of the bal
lots cast in the election districts," and
that, therefore, the' candidates defeated
on the face of the* returns are "left to
Â«uch action -at law or otherwise as may
be appropriate.". "]
Judges Bartlett and Vain, in their
dissenting opinion, imply that the de
cision of the majority involves "a con
struction that emasculates the ballot
law and, as it seems to us, ignores its
plain provisions."
The dissenting Judges thus conclude
their opinion:

that an appeal would be made to the

Pioneers
Ruled Nevada Bank
After It Was
Founded.
Louis McLane. former president of the
Nevada Bank and one .of California's
most successful business men in the
early days, passed away yesterday at his
home in Baltimore at the ripe old age of
S6 years. Ho was still well remembered
by many business men of this city, though
he had not resided here for many years.
Mr. McLane was born in Wilmington,
Del., in ISI9. When but 16 years of age
he left his class at Newark College and
was appointed a midshipman in the navy.
He served as a soldier in the Mexican
war under General Fremont, and soon
after the war started out to make his
fortune. In- ISSO he arrived In California,
and from the day of his arrival fortune
, seemed to smile brightly upon him.
Mr. McLane started in the steamboat
and traffic business, and his genius in
this line, was recognized at once, for in
1855 he was appointed head of Wells, Far
go & Co.'s Express- He moved to New
York and made that city his headquar
ters, holding the position until I&6S, when
he decided to retire to private life.
While engaged in managing the affairs
of the express company his business tal
ent was realized, and he, was one of the
original founders and stockholders of the
Bank of California, the Pacific Insurance
Company, fhe California Drydock Com
pany the Pacific Stage Company and the
Overland Milling Company.
When he retired as head of the express
company Mr. McLane went to live In Bal
timore, but when the news of the great
Comstock discovery was made known it
was a signal for his return to the Golden
State, and In 1575 he came to California I
at the urgent request of James Flood
and other great capitalists and was made
president of the famous Nevada Bank.
He held that responsible position for a
number of years, and was known as a
great financier from one end of the coun
try to the other.
Mr. McLane left California, for good ~ ln
1573 and took up his residence in Balti
more. While there he established a large
financial institution and was a power in
the Maryland city till a few years ago,
when he retired from all active business
affairs and led a quiet and secluded life.

MAY PROSECUTE
BLACKMAILERS
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Dec. 13.â Some time to
morrow an attorney for the late Robert
Ballantine of Newark, who killed himself
on Saturday night, will confer with the
members of the Ballantine family con
cernlngr the prosecution of the alleged
blackmailers, who : are being hunted by
the Virginia authorities.
During several months Ballantine had
been under, the influence of the band he
was mulcted of $70.(M0 in money, and
notes. â¢ Payment â¢on the notes has been
stopped. It is believed that Ballantine
gave the blacmailers no more than $20,
000 in cash. BfIBIBRBMi
-It is now known that Ballantine was
pursued relentlessly, after an episode in a
hotel in Charlottesville. "Va. \u25a0\u25a0 He was a
free drinker. One night he met 'three
menâ persons who had often relied upon
his generosity. He became intoxicated.
It is declared that pistols were drawn to'
force him to sign papers, which the black
mailers threatened to expose unless he
gave them money.
; From a ,few hundred dollars the de
mands of the \u25a0 band ran Into thou
sands. .Ballantine was in a fair/ way to
.be*. robbed \u25a0; of ! his large fortune when he
came to New York several weeks ago to
consult wlth^ his counsel, \u25a0 Carl Fi3cher-
Hansen.
-Ballantine returned to Charlottsville
determined to expose the blackmailing
plot. \u25a0' He communicated "with'the police of
Virginia, who were to' have remained si
lent until .the negotiations .were completed
in i the -District 'Attorney's office in this
city. to; investigate the standing of a New
York man .who" was "an' outside member
of -the 1 band and who, it is said, framed
the plot.
On Friday afternoon Ballantine came to
New York and with his - attorney pre-"
pared statements to be presented to Dis
trict Attorney Jerome the next day. When
he} learned that Jerome vwas in \u25a0 Ijakeville.
Conn., he^ became disappointed. He went
to > his home., in . Newark.. A few, hours
later he" killed himself. \u25a0 1... "..~ ." :
' Ballant ine's counsel says he has state- ;
3
ments which will be presented to the Vir
ginia court should the family" after a
consultation decide to prosecute the men
who, it is alleged, drove Ballantinc to
his death. The family. It is understood,
is divided on this point.

C The first of the 19C6 styles of the Peerless
Knabe Piano are now on display. * The instru-
ments pictured above, designated as Knabe
Piano, Style â¢* W," is beyond question the
most artistic creation of this famous factory.
Its case, "Old English" in designâ of the . â¢
richest of mahoganies â is considerably small-
er in dimensions than former models and is
finished without polish, or in the New Art
style.
d In tone, the new Style "W" is a revela-
lation. Full and powerful, it possesses all of
the-character of thatof the grand piano, meeting
every requirement ' 'of) the heaviest fortis-
simos, retaining at the same time that purity
and liquid sweetness; that living, singing
quality so abundantly present in Knabe crea-
tions "and without which no piano can be
truly great.
<L The action of the Style "W " is the per- ,
fection of elasticity and responsiveness. In
its mechanical construction it is the scientific
adaption of the Knabe Grand action applied
to the upright piano. The same perfection
of touch, rapidity of repetition and delicacy
are present, making it ideal in every detail.
CL The Style " W f V Knabe is particularly
adapted, by reason of its size, to small homes
and apartments where the question of. space
is of importance. The elegant simplicity of
its architecture, the satin-like finish of its
case, insure a perfect harmony with the
surroundings of the modern home.
C The price of the Style "W" Knabe is
$525.00. Easy payments may be arranged.
G. Store will be open evenings until after
the Holidays.

Ine that he be given nn opportunity to

Ryan, to share In Ryan's holdings In
the Equitable Life Assurance Society.
The committee replied that this re
quest would be granted and Mr. Ilarrl
nian may testify to-morrow.-
NEW YORK, Dec. 13.â Two incidents
affecting the life insurance situation in
New York to-day overshadowed the leg
islative investigation! While the commit*
tee was inquiring' into the conduct of the
Prudential Life Insurance Company and
the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company
George W. Perkins resigned as first vice
president and chairman of the finance
committee of the New York Life Insur
ance Company. He was succeeded as vice
president by Alexander E. Orr, president
of the New York City Rapid Transit
Commission, and as chairman of the
finance committee by John Claflin, - head
of the H. B. Claflin Company.
Another important move in the situation
was the election by the trustees of the
Mutual Life Insurance Company to-day
of Charles A. Peabody to succeed Rich
ard A. McCurdy as president of that
company at $60,000 a year. McCurdy'e
salary was $150,000. Peabody is a lawyer,
the American representative of William
Waldorf Astor and a director in several
banks and other corporations, of which
one is the Illinois Central Railroad Com
pany. Peabody also was nominated as a
trustee of the Mutual Life Insurance
Company to succeed Justice Rufus W.
Peckham, and Emory McClintock was
nominated to succeed Elihu Root. They
cannot be elected as trustees until the
next meeting of the board.
United States Senator John P. Dryden
of New Jersey, president of the Pruden
tial Life Insurance Company, again tes
tified before the investigating committee
to-day and made a statement to the com
mittee, giving his reasons for favoring
Federal supervision of life insurance com
panies through a national insurance de
partment, which, he said, should have au
thority over them. This, he said, would
benefit both the companies and the in
sured. â .
The tendency of the holders of indus
trial policies in the Prudential and Met
ropolitan Life Insurance Companies to
lapse was examined in great detail by
Charles E. Hughes, counsel for the com
mittee, who read a statement by the Pru
dential that ' 37 per cent of its industrial
policies lapse within five years of their
Issue. Senator Dryden declared there
-ras much to be regretted,, from the
\u25a0.tandpoint of the company as well as
that of the insured, and that the ten
dency now, was toward a greater persist
ency* on the part of the Industrial hold
ers than formerly. The Senator asserted
that industrial insurance, even with high
rates and the tendency to lapse, was the
greatest economic force now in operation
in this country.
Just before adjournment to-day Haley
Flske, vice president of the Metropolitan
Company, told of an incident in which
that company commissioned William A.
Read to buy 3333 chares of railroad stock
for the company. Flske said that Read
the same day sold n the stock to a com
pany of brokers at>slo a share less than
it had been sold for to the -Metropolitan.

I believe it could pay $1 per barrel more for
this oil than it is paying and ' still make a

the people of ?CO,OOO a day. or $22,000,000 a

; Leader I of the Minority
SEQUEL TO REJECTION
OF RAIL RATE BILL
Quarrel Begun at Last
Session of Congress Gives
the Republican Members
Four Hours of Amusement
"WASHINGTON, Dec. 13.â Tho "washing
of t Democratic linen for the amusement
of Republicans," as Williams, the minor
ity leader, put it on ; Monday, occupied
the attention of the House for more than
four hours to-day. The result accom
plished was a "den" thrown at the minor
ity leader by Representative Laraar of
Florida and another by Representative
Shackleford of Missouri. The complaint
of. both resulted from the failure of ..Wil
liams to recommend their appointment as
members of the Committee on Interstate
and Foreign Commerce. Both made long
speeches, in which Williams' leadership
was assailed from many points. â¢
Williams replied to Laraar at pome
length, and briefly to Shackleford. His
defense was that at the last session the
Democrats on this committee were divided
and he deemed it necessary for the good
of the party and the country that a
united minority report should be made on
the subject of railroad rate legislation..
At times there was' high tension in the 1
debate. Lamar was particularly bitter in
his criticism and openly declared that his
personal friendship for Williams was for
ever at an end unless the criticism, of him
self were retracted. He, however, would
recognize Williams as the party leader.
Shackleford denounced all bosses and
placed himself entirely independent of
party leadership in the House.
LAMAR BEGINS THE\ ATTACK.
Lamar said that he did not agree with
Williams that Republicans would enjoy
personalities between Democrats. . Em
phasizing this, he referred to the personal
debate of \last session between Sullivan
of Massachusetts and Hearst of New;
York. At that time, s he charged, the
minority leader . had made ;no objection
to the procedure. ._
Lamar said that he considered his re
moval from thp Commerce Committee an
act absolutely* untenable and an asper
sion upon his private character.. It had
gone to the country through the press
that the minority leader . would not tol
erate followers of Hearst. \u25a0 , â ,
Williams was at once recognized to re
ply. * '
"I am," he said, "about to perform a
very unpleasant duty, and one as to the
wisdom of which I have serious doubts.
The gentleman takes himself too serious
ly. He thinks he can make a national
issue out of a committee assignment, but
he cannot do it. He thinks he was re
moved, but he was not. There was.no
committee."
Williams asked if he w6uld not have
been lacking in moral couTage, in every
essential of a floor leader, if he had
made up a minority membership of the
Commerce Committee .which would
have been divided four to two on the
question of railroad rates.
"My brother would have 'gone off
that "committee under similar circum- !
stances," said he, and he added. that if
the Hearst bill received tha minority
support in committee he would have
supported it in caucus. Conversion to
the Hearst bill he likened to the con
version of Saul on his way to Damas
cus, It was inspired, he declared.
HOUSE APPLAUDS WILEUMS.
Applause followed Williams when' he
Baid he had not allowed personalities
I 'to influence his transaction of public
service. He referred to : the committee
appointments of Hearst â Labor and Ir
rigation of Arid Landsâ and admitted ]
that he did not love Hearst.
"Why should I love a millionaire
who owns many newspapers which he
seems "to be devoting to tearing me
down?" he asked. \
Lamar at once asked for recognition,
as did Shackleford. Lamar was rec
ognized. He spoke with feeling and
charged that the minority leader had
called the rate bill caucus of last ses
sion because he was angry at being
turned 1 down by his colleagues on the
Miles amendment. ;
"It was not a caucus; it was a gold
brick," he said.
Williams interrupted to caution La
mar and"""to prevent unpleasant things
from happening," . adding that "the
gentleman is not permitted to use in
sulting language on. the floor of the
House."
Lamar referred to a letter of criti
cism of Hearst by Williams. The lat
ter denied the criticism. During this
denial Shackleford commended Hearst
personally and for his rate bill. He
said he was glad to see .that President
Roosevelt in his message had "come
around to the Hearst bilL"
"The word of one Missouri Democrat
is equal to that of two leaders," was a
retort of Shackleford to a statement
of Williams denying the use of certain
language at the St. Louis convention.
.."In Missouri we have raised the cry,
'Down" with the bosses/-" declared
Shackleford, who insisted that the
wishes of his constituents were much
more to him than the leadership of
Williams.
DEN'UXCIATIOX OF BOSSES. 3
{Continuing his denunciation of bosses,
Shackleford said it was the McCalls
and McCurdys who prevented the ejec
tion of W. J. Bryan as President and
that H. H, Rogers and J." Pierpont Mor
gan would be delighted - to . have the
Democracy of ; the 'country under the
control- of' one: boss. I :
Williams said he had enough and did
not desire to reply. The past had gone.
He looked to -the future and believed
that ' this; year r there 'would i be foand
six Democrats' , on , a committee who
would agree. , He , was of discord.
"We Jare represented 3 now lin all the
funny papers of the country as a 7a 7 don

to the Republican* side' of \u25a0; tho chamber,
."that,? the - people " ; of the country.^! are

it is partially on account of such things
as ; happened here this morning that it
is afraid of us." " \u25a0

Back of thia party opposition there
is understood, to be a protest on the
part :â of strong: railroad influences
which, hold that Lane, though a clever

it is to -haye v the power which the
President is; asking. â¢
.It is said President Roosevelt, in his
talks with . has displayed no
very great interest in Lane. Hemade
the appointment because of a promise
he had given President Benjamin Ide
Wheeler" of the University of Califor
nia. This promise was given some time
agoâ indeed, before the railroad . agita
tion became -acute. The close personal
relations between the President and
Dr. Wheeler made it impossible for an
escape from' adhering to the pledge,
but the President has no strong per
sonal interest- in' \ Lane himself.

STEALS TO PAY
MONEY SHARKS
CHICAGO, Decv- 13.â William J. Smith,
for twelve years confidential tookkeeper
for the Robert SUvenson Drug Company,
was yesterday arrested for forgery. Al
though he had taken almost J3OOO from
the funds of the company in less than a
year, little or none of It was spent on
himself, as was evidenced by his appear
ance when arrested. His clothing was
old and worn and his overcoat was not
warm enough to protect him from, the
cold. Smith lived with his wife and two
children in a cottage.
"The money all went to the loan
sharks." he said. "They kept threatening
to garnlshee my wages, and I knew if
that happened I would lose my Job and
be able to-do nothing for my children.
"My first false step was taken about
three years ago. when a friend of mine
invented a candy slot machine." Smith
added. "I borrowed $200 from the money
lenders and signed a note for $33), which
he borrowed to put the machine on the
market. Well, It fell through. I lost my
$200, , my friend disappeared and I yas at
the mercy of the money lenders. All the
money I took was paid to them.- I did
not get any of It, neither did my wife and "
children..
"I shall make a clean breast of it," aaid
Smith. "I guess I can do my family as
much good while in the penitentiary as
I have in the last year." _ .

COLLINS DENIES
EVERY CHARGE
Says Statements of Witnesses
for the Prosecution Are
False and Documents Lie
FOURTH WIFE APPEARS
Entry on Yendome Hotel
Register in the Defendant's
Writing Brings in No. 1 4
"The testimony of Thomas E. Cur
ran regarding the marriage ceremony
before Father Connolly Is absolutely
false. The testimony of William New
man, Henry Newman and Florence
Newman regarding that event la un
true. The statement contained In the
application for a marriage license Is a
lie, the marriage certificate is a lie,
the marriage memorial Is false, arising
from a mistake In the marriage li
cense. The testimony, of Dr. Kahn and
Dr. Rogers Is false and so is the tes
timony of Josephine Angele. 1 never
married Cbarlotta, associated with her
or had improper relations with her,
and she never bore me any children."
Such is the startling statement made
by George I>. Collins on the witness
stand in Judge Lennon's court yester
day. It contains the defense of Qeorge
D. Collins. Denial upon denial flowed
from his lips as the testimony against
him was quoted by District Attorney
Byington. For a greater part of the
day he was on the stand under the,
direct examination of Attorney Me-
Pike, telling the story of his relations
with the Newmans. When Byington
I began the cross-examination almost
every word from Collins' lips was a
denial or impeachment of a witness
for the prosecution.
A misstep was taken by the defense
In the introduction of Dr. S. F. Long,
who attended Agnes during a severe
illness and who signed a certificate
for the death of a child of Agnes. The
questions of Collins to the witness
brought from the dootor the informa-.
tion that the woman \u25a0he attended at
the Collins home was Introduced to
him by Collins as Mrs. Agnes Collins.
Collins' questions left the matter of
the husband in doubt.
Under cross-examination the witness
placed the defendant In so bad a light
that Collins later, under oath, said that
he had been misinformed or he would
not have called the doctor to his defense.
Upon questioning by Byington, Dr.
Long said that he visited the home of
George D. Collins in 1898 and there was
introduced by him to Mrs. Agnes Collins
and was told by the defendant that she
was the wife of tys brother, John C. Col
lins, who was a marine fireman on a
whaling ship then in northern waters.
Upon this information Dr. Long made
out a death certificate for a child of John
C. and Agnes Collins.
TRY TO STOP TESTIMONY.
In vain did Jhe attorneys for the de
fense attempt to stop x the,: tide of testi
mony by frantically interposing objec
tion upon objection. Byington's questions
brought out the most important testimony
so far elicited. Even on redirect' exam
ination the defense,., failed to avert dis
aster. The deeper the probe ran the deep
er the defendant sank in the mire. The
testimony of Dr. Long was positive and
conclusive. Upon [ his .leaving the - stand
District Attorney Byihgtoa's face' wore
''the. smile that won't come, off.'.' . - > , V
Collins immediately resumed the wit
ness stand and characterized every state
ment made by Dr. Long regarding his
brother, John C. Collins, as false. He ex
claimed loudly that he had no, brother of
that name, never had one, and that no
such story was told by him or ever oc
curred to him.
During the cross-examination of Col
lins the register of the Vendome Hotel of
this city was Introduced, showing a reg
istration made by the defendant on March
25, 1905, at the time Collins claims to have
been a widower, showing that George D.
Collins and wife stayed at the hotel. Ac
cording to the evidence this introduces a
Mrs. Collins number four.
DEFENDANT'S HARD DAY.
It was a weary day for Collins. He
took the stand at 10 o'clock In the
morning to resume his defense against
the perjury charge. He adhered in the
main to the declarations of his open
ing statement to, the jury regarding
his plan of defense. , He explained in
detail his flight to British Columbia
to. avoid "the mob of newspaper men,
camera men. and others who were
hounding and harassing" him until his
health gave way. He also added that
owing to aroused public sentiment he
knew he^ could not . get justice at . that
time in San Francisco. He criticized
the actions of the press and its repre-"
sentatives in harsh "terms that brought
delight to the criminal portion of the
spectators in the courtroom.
Collins' cross-examination began
late In the afternoon. He \ entered a
general denial of the statements of
the: prosecution's witnesses and par
ticularly the statements of Dr. Long.
He claimed that the Newmans "scooped
up" all of Agnes' effects and probably
had her marriage contract that he
drew: up for her. When asked as to its
location he proclaimed that he was
not a Sherlock Holmes, and the spec
tators laughed.
'â¢''Collins maintained that he was out
of the city at the time of the birth. of
each. child and that he does not know
the doctors in r attendance. He failed
to remember \u25a0- the ages of George, Con
suelo or, May and resented* Byington's
Imputation that he was throwing
"dirt" on Charlotta throughout : the
trial. ; He said that he permitted May
to remain in the house with . Florence
and Charlotta only upon the pleadings
of the latter. ;.; /; -
j Judge Kirby Mahon of Sutter County
was an interested . spectator "of the
day's proceedings. , The case will con
tinue this morning at 10 o'clock.

SCOTT'S EMULSION.
RIGHT NOURISHMENT.
: \u25a0-. We think of nourishment
as food â meats, soups, vege-
tables, etc., but that's onlyJialf.
It's not the food alone that
counts -but the good that we
get from food that furnishes
nourishment. A pound of
steak is of less value to a
\veak stomach than a crust of
bread is to a strong digestion.
But - weak stomachs can be
made strong. Begin by eat-
ing less; have regular hours
for meals ; avoid fancy things
and about' a half hour after
eating take a tablespoonful of
Scott's Emulsion. It's a fact
of medical history that people
have lived on not much else
but Scott's Emulsion for a
-iong time â not only lived but
gained . flesh and recovered
their strength and health.
From the pure Norwegian-
cod liver oil to the last drop
of glycerine, Scott's Emulsion
contains just the strengthT-
giving and health-building
elements needed forlow vital-
ity, weak digestion and poorly
nourished bodies.

or old, there must be forces for good
and forces for evil and that no city
can be perfect.
Touching directly 1 , upon the aspect
of what has been termed a "carnival
of crime" in .this city, Mr. Walkley
said that it was most unwise and un
fair, to condemn this or any oth<rr city
for crimes which occurred oultlde its
limits. In speaking of the Police De
partment as a corrective force in the
community, Mr. Walkley said:
Most abused, last to be t>ral6ecl, ever cari->
<-at ureÂ«i and maligned, the pclice are in Tact
a etronc corrective force. 'The mere fart that
authority walks about our streets with the
garb and eign of authority in plain view is of
its-elf a strong factor in preventing and correct
ing evil.
There in no city that is wholly protected.
The garden of Kden was not properly policed
and evil, that subtle and cunning enemy oX
society, eludes the best of police and detec
tive*. It is folly to accuee the police of Oak
land for a murder in Fruitvale, where no po
lice protection is provided. It is equelly falla- .
clous to make an outcry against Oakland for a
crime committed in Berkeley. It Â»is always un
wise to take Isolated cases and condemn a
community. ' ' - * -!"â¢ f.b
This is not an application of whitewash on
my liart, nor is It a display of complimentary
fireworks. It is my honest conviction that
many who are ready to condemn are not ac
quainted with the forces to be overcome. Think
of the frailties of human nature, the depths of
degradation, the organized forces of evil which
are Ftrlkln? at every "home in Oakland,-and i
you will have Just an inkling cf what an ad
ministration has to. combat.

SAYS LIBRARY
IS VALUABLE
ACQUISITION
BERKELEY. Dec. 13.â Professor Reuben
Gold Thwaites, secretary of the Wisconsin
Historical Society and a member ot the fac
ulty \u25a0of tha University of California summer
school of last year, in a letter sent to Presi
dent Wheeler to-day, compliments the State
University en the acquisition of the Bancroft
historical library. This library was recently
purchased by the Regents of the university
at a cost of $150,000. Professor Thwaltea
thinks it is a priceless historical possession.
In writing to President "Wlieeler lie gives his
views os follows:" ' . V
"The purchase "of the -Hitbert Howe Ban
croft . library by the University, of California
Is a long step in advance tor that institution.
The large public or semi-public libraries of
the Pacific Coast, while admirably adminis
tered, have been inadequately equipped with
: iriipb:rtant -American history sources, particu
larly noticeable. being* the scarcity of material
for' firet-hand investigation of the history â¢ of
the coast and mountain -States themselves.
The reason for this latter -condition has long
been recognizedâ the lcciilns up of very much
of the material in the private collection of
Mr. Bancroft. - Knowledge of this ifact ; has
resulted in partial paralysis ' of research work
IYi "Western "history at the great centers of
'learning on the coast. Scholars have been
waiting for the opening of the Bancroft
ttectures before undertaking important mono
graphic enterprise* of this character.
"The long hoped-for event has at last hap
pened, and we can -new confidently expect
that research work in Western history will
at once be vigorously undertaken, not only
by graduate students at' Berkeley and Stan
ford â for the proximity of the two universi
ties' renders the new collection almost -as
available to Stanford men. as: it !Â» to those
ot the State University â but by scholars gen
erally. Berkeley will' now become a Mecca
for "historical students from all parts of West
ern -North America. â¢ Canadians and Mexi
cans will tlnd the collection quite as important
t9 them as to ' the - people ot . 'the States. I
look to see speedily established there^one of
the most important graduate schools in Amer
ican-, history known in this country.
"There. Is' every reason for proleund. con
gratulation upon - the result. \u25a0 By it tlÂ» Uni
versity of California gains renown and Amer
ican I historical scholarship at large Is bene
fited most materially. Now that the transfer
ha? been made, the surprising thing- is that
s<> obvious a purchase was not undertaken
many years a so."

WORKS BOARDS
WINS VICTORY
Court Believes Commission
of Liability for Violation
of the- Building Laws
HUNT DECIDES THE CASE
Holds Owners and r. Con
tractors ; Are
ior i: Safety of Structures
Superior Judge Hunt has decided that
the Board of Public Wjorks cannot be
held liable for injuries resulting to per
sons through -accident directly, attrib
utable to . violations of â¢ the / building
law. Those persons guilty of the tort,
or conduct, are the .^ ones re
sponsible, holds .-.'the court, -.for the
Board of Works : cannot supervise all
building operations and* to hold:- that
they should and be j held -responsible
for a -violation" of the law "would Im
pose upon them a burden too onerous
to bear." \u25a0 .; â¢
â¢The decision was reached in the case
in which. Dennis Horgah sought $1109
damages.for injuries sustained through
the collapse on July 8, 1905, of a build
ing at Ninth" and Tehama streets.
Coupled with Charles Stockholm; the
builder, as defendants were j the f mem
bers of the Board of Works and their
sureties. The Board of Works . has
been exonerated, however? and as to its
members, the court has sustained a de
murrer without leave to amend. In the
opinion the court says: *.. [j
The complaint states that Stockholm did
not, use proper skill In "the construction of the
bulldins in question, but that dlsreKarding
the' terms of the ordinance he placed therein
supports, Umber and other material Insuffi
cient to safely carry the weight placed thereon,
and -in consequence the building collapsed- and
tho- plaintiff sustained Injuries- for which dam
ages are sought to be recovered in this action.
The complaint also charges that the defend
ants," the members of the .Board of Public
Works, - violated their duty in the premises by
failing: to stop the construction of said build
ing or to notify the owner thereof of its dan
gerous and unsafe condition.
H Is the Dlaintlft'B contention that if the
contractor owner engaged in the erection of a
building violates any single detail of any of the
numerous provisions of the building law and
injury to another results therefrom, the mem
bers of the Board of Public Works are liable.
. Such a contention cannot be sustained. The
liability ' of members of the Board of Public
Works In cases of this character is entirely
different from that which exists In resoect to
their obligation to keep the streets and high
ways of the city in proper condition and or
der. The charter does not require that they
shall supervise the ' construction, alteration,
raising and repairing of every building in
the city. To hold otherwise would be to main
tain that under the ordinances whenever a
smokestack, oven or furnace connected with
any building becomes defective or unsafe the
Board of Public- Works would be re?t>onslblu
for' any injury thereby occasioned.
.Such a construction of- the statutes would
impose upon' them a burden too onerous to
bear. For these reasons I am of the opinion
that as to the Board of Public "Works the de
murrer should be sustained.
THE VALUE OF BEER.
The EÂ«*t>nlnlÂ» of Quality and Health
fulnrss.
\ \u25a0>\u25a0
Experience ban shown that the prime
requisites of a really C|ood Beer aro
three in numberâ superiority of .the
materials, treatment in the. brewin&and
proper maturing or ageing before mar
keting." ,
Perhaps first of importance is the na
ture Â»and character of the materials*
used. The Anheuser-Busch Brewing
Ass'n, whose product. BUDWEISER,
has come to be considered, as a stand
ard from which Beer-Quality is to be
judged, have found that" materials of
the very highest quality only can be
used, if really Good Beer is to result.
They have found also, that of all mate
rials-permissible in brewing, only the
best quality Barley-Malt, the choicest
grade of Hops, superior quality Yeast,
with perhaps a small percentage of the
best Rice, can be depended upon to pro
duce a Beer of the highest degree of
quality, flavor and palatability.
This Association confirms what is
generally admitted among brewers,
that to produce a Beer of excellence,
expensive modern methods of brewing
must be followed and the most rigid
sanitary precautions observed at all
stages. Cleanliness, Purity and careful
Sterilization are considered vitally es
sential by them In common with all
good brewers. â¢ ' _ "â¢ '
Anheuser-Busch also contends that
the exquisite flavor and acknowledged
healthfulness of Budweiser is to be at
tributed, to a. great extent, to their ex
treme care In maturing and ageing.
Their storage capacity of over 600.000
barrels makes it unnecessary for them
to market their product until properly
aged and in consequence it possesses to
the greatest degree the quality, mel
lowness and flavor which has caused
Budweiser to be termed by those, who
know, "The King oÂ« Bottled Beers."

NO PARK POLITICS.
r pHE original park reservations in this city were procured largely
I by the efforts of the late Frank McCoppin. He left a perma
*\u25a0 nent impress upon San Francisco, the city that he had faith
fully served as Supervisor, Mayor, Senator and Park Commissioner.
In its primitive condition Golden Gate Park was a vast expanse
of sand, blown in from the ocean beach. When it. was .reserved
for park purposes the task of its conquest from the sand seemed so
difficult that the city sought expert advice.
Frederick Law Olmsted, the creator of Central Park in New
York, had lived for some time in California and was connected, in
a professional capacity, with the administration of the Mariposa
grant. His celebrity as a landscape architect caused his selection
as an expert to pass upon Golden Gate Park. After a long survey
he reported that it would be impossible to make a park on that, lo
cation. As a substitute he advised that Van Ness avenue be ex
cavated and curved toward the ocean beach so as to furnish a pro
tected boulevard, below the surface, as a driveway between the
city and the sea.
In defiance of that expert opinion the development of Golden
Gate Park was undertaken. As that delightful* pleasure place ex
ists to-day it is the work of the creative genius of John McLaren,
the superintendent. The sand drift has been stopped by Norwegian
sand grass and lupine and acacia. The sand has been filled with'
humus and made fertile. Groves and belts of coniferous trees have
risen like islands and archipelagoes Qn the sea of sandy. Lawns
cover the free spaces. Flowers and illuminated borders give the
charm of form and color and aroma to the scene, and Golden Gate
Park is one of the celebrated parks of the world. The space it
covers was once an unsightly waste. Its broad river of sand seemed
to flow irresistibly toward the city, threatening an inundation more
sinister than a flood of water. Its conquest seemed hopeless, and we
can excuse Olmsted for his despair in the face of a condition that
was novel to him.
Every corner and cranny of the park bears the .impress of John
McLaren, gardener, florist, botanist, landscape engineer, naturalist
and gentleman. Every bloom and blade of grass is in testimony to
his skill and devotion. The spicy foliage of the conifers is incense
in his honor. The children who shout at play upon the velvet lawns
are the beneficiaries of his toil. The whole great park is a monu
ment built. to his stubborn persistence. He has lived out a saying
of his Scotch race, "A stout heart to a stey brae." No man ever
confronted a steeper hill nor climbed ut with a stouter heart. In
his office he has lived through, and outlived all changes of adminis
tration. When the Park Commissioners were appointed by the
State, party politics rolled to Ms feet and stopped, as he had stopped
the sands of the sea. When the city took control of the park, under
the new charter, party politics found him at work and left him
among his gardens and groves and lawns. Indeed it is only now
that rumor has been able to whisper of a change. Rumor, some
times right and often wrong, is busy now with the position of
John McLaren, only because the place he holds is exceptional and
he is an exceptional man, and rumor is mistaken. John McLaren
may grow old, but to the end of his firm faculties he will be super
intendent of Golden Gate Park. His position is one that politicians
cannot touch without a loss of prestige that will be greater than
any gain they get by a change.
It must be said in justice to the motives of the. municipal admin
istration that it has given.no sign of such vandal use of power as
would be shown in overthrowing John McLaren. .The city -is about
to make other parks and playgrounds for children. When they are
finished San Francisco will be full jeweled, with Golden Gafte Park
as the great brilliant, the Kohinoor of her park system. Standing
at the beginning of park expansion this city needs John McLaren
more than ever. Whom else have We who carries in his mind so
clear an image of what can be brought out on any given park tract?
Who else knows so well the grouping of copse and grove, the effec
tive association of plants and foliage?
He has so associated the planting of Golden Gate Park, an-1
with such knowledge of physical conditions, that its beauties have
the same blush in January as in July, and it blooms every day, in
eternal luster. Instead of dismissing him, San Francisco will cher
ish him for what he has done and for what he can do in the further
development of beauties that can be created by his skill, and the
kindly climate, which permits a summer park all the year.'
KINDLY DEATH.
A GREAT statesman said that the leader of men who left
death out of his plans and estimates was neglectful of a main
and certain element in human affairs. In the history of na
tions death has often come with timely and kindly touch, but never
with a more healing hand than in the case of Senator Mitchell of
Oregon. His career had "been long and checkered: It had its seamy
side, but it had also its days of glory. That he had capacity for
leadership is attested by his long control of his State. . That he had
the gentle art of making friends is proved by the many who abided
with him in shame and adversity, and by the throng that made a
mourning bower, hung with chaplets, of his death chamber. .
One need ndt be suspected of passing lightly what was wrong
in him because due credit is given to what was strong in him. He
led men, dominated policies, wrought mightily for 'others and for
his own ambitions. From a lowly station he rose high, and when he
fell it was far. The fall, in his enfeebled age, was fatal. He drank
humiliation to the lees. But before- the awful -judgment of men
was a finality, before the appalling sentence touched him, death
came like evening to the weary, afid with all his sorrows upon him
he rested. Living he incurred harsh judgment by missteps for
which there is no explanation consistent with a proper sense of
duty, but public morals take no harm by saying for him dead that
he "had qualities, and that many features of his career were far
better than its close. Even in the Senate where he served so long,
and where his death has been passed by unnoted, there might be
some genius that could do him justice and draw out from his career
a lesson that would admonish his countrymen, and yet leave the
THE PRESS OF THE NATION.
It has been much the fashion to evade the civil service law, and Presi

THE WIFE WITH A PET
A Woman With an Abnormal Love for Animals Is a
.- Poor Matrimonial Investment v \u0084 .
DOROTHY FENIMORE
A RECENT divorce case in which
the wife was willing to let her
husband keep the children, pro
vided she could retain guardianship of
the family poodle provoked me to the
cogitation: "Should a young man pick
out for a wife a girl who is fond of
pets?"
A dimpled darling of a girl playing
with a love of a kitten is a cozy sight.
An \u25a0 up-to-dato Diana 'with/ a giant
mdstlff by her side is a fit subject for
a i>ainter.
Kindness to animals is an outward
sign of inward grace. All this I freely
grant. But is it wise to choose for a
life partner. a girl who loves her Bos
ton terrier with an imitation mother
love, who kisses "Dandy's" moist and
smutty-colored nose, and treats . him
like a canine idiot?
In the case of David Copperfield and
his child wife Dora, the little dog Jip
was undoubtedly a boon, to them both.
But that was because Dora was Dora â
dare I say, one of the- mo^st adorable
children in fiction? Furthermore, an
English novel needs a dog in it for the
sake of local color. And a lively, self
respecting dog is different from a pam
pered, wall-eyed poodle. . \u25a0'-â¢ ! \S,
.Butâ trying not to be too cynical â
are -pets, even pedigreed ones, a good
matrimonial investment?
It doosn't follow that a man is going
to love his sweetheart's dog as he loves
her incomparable self. I have known
the book of romance to become dog
eared for a couple and love's poetry
to be turned to doggerel because the
sweetest girl in the world asked the
dearest man on earth to take care of
her bulldog for her while she' left town
for a fortnight.
The tale is as short as the dog's was.
For^ two days the young man cared
for the pet entrusted to him as ten

Americans what they are slow to learn,
the sanctity and permanence of home."
To have in your home a living lesson
In domesticity is worth the price of a

into account when they made licensing
of cats compulsory In the State on the

that compared with dogs they were,
useless luxuries.

So well did the young wife and her
stepdaughters pel along that affection
was soon iirmly established among them

before Judge Graham as an applicant for
a divorce her stepdaughters came to help
her out. All testified that Baker had
cruelly treated the plaintiff, physical in
juries inflicted by him being among the
grounds for the decree that was urged.
Judge Graham granted the young wife's
prayÂ«*r. The family has been living at
11 62 Washington street. Oakland.

NEW READING
FOR CHILDEN
OF THE COAST
Young people will rejoice to learn
that a new juvenile magazine, called
"The Golden Age." is to make its ap
pearance just before the holidays. It
Is to be the size and style of St. Nich
olas. It will be, to amuse, of 'course;
but. something 1 much more than that,
for the Intention is to publish, a really
pood class of literature. A number of
school men are i/iterested in the pro
ject, and the magazine will ' provide
matter that will be useful for supple
mentary reading In the schools. This
periodical reading: Is a much-desired
thing, and the schools have difficulty in
finding lAateriaJ of the right sort.
It will be a magazine that will please
both by its appearance and its contents.
The California writer. Miss Adeline
Knapp, is assisting In the preparation
of the first number, and this will cause
its, issuing to be watched for with
eager expectation on this coast espe
ciaJly. There is abundant need of a
new juvenile magazine, as the growth
of this class of literature has not kept
pace with the abundance of reading
matter provided for adults. The au
thor of that recent frank, first-hand
study of the j'outhful toilers in New
York and other big American cities,
called '"The Long Daj-," attributes
much of both incompetence in work
and immorality in conversation and ac
tion to the lack of training young
people to read good literature; and she
says the only way to create a taste
for the best is to begin early in life.
The best of reading was philanthropic
ally provided for the work-girls of New
York, but they could not take an in
terest in the books lent them, and
went back to reading the sensational
trash, cleverly given a local setting
to bring it in close resemblance to
their own lives and environment.
Margaret Sangster is also authority
for the assertion that if juveniles are
early accustomed^ to ' fine literature,
when they grow Vf </fder they will not be
satisfied with the inferior. A maga
zine that will add to the taste of ju
veniles for the best reading will have
an ample field of usefulness; and we
trust "The Golden Age" will find it 3
work, its reward and an assured self
satisfaction that it is aiding to make
the age golden in every gt^ad sense of
the word.

Lafe insurance, really to insure, should
be conducted by the Federal Government,
as it is in more enlightened countries.
With tile credit and the resources of the
whole nation behind his policy, the in

with absolute certainty that they would
not be wasted by extravagant managers,
and that when he died his family would
get what was eomlne to them. And he
wou!d not have to pay more than half
as much as he pays now to private com
panies, if the experience of State insur
ance in New Zealand is a fair test.â

The high quality of its serial stories
has always been a notable feature of
Harper's Bazar. Probably no other
magazine devoted mainly to the inter
ests of women can show so fine a list.
In the past two years alone three re
markable successes have first appeared
in its pages: "Memoir of a Baby," by
Josephine Dodge Daskam; "The Mas
querader," by Mrs. Thurston, and now
Mary E. Wilkins Freeman's "The Debt
or," which will conclude publication
with the December number. Following
"The Debtor" a new novel by Robert
Hichens, author of "The Garden of Al
lah," will begin with the January num
ber. This^novel. entitled "The Call of
the Blood," Is a remarkably dramatic
tale, the scenes of which are laid in
Sicily, where Mr. Hichens has lived for
the past year. It will be fully illus
trated by Orson Lowell.
Maeterlinck proclaims his belief in the
immortality of the soul in an^essay pub
lished in Harper's Magazine for Decem
ber. His arguments will appeal to think
ing people, and may serve to arrest the
conclusions of the doubtful mind said to
be so prevalent now. Maeterlinck, having
proved his assumption, says: "It is now
a question ... of knowing what part
of our intellectual and moral require
ments will pass into our eternal and uni
versal life. This Is not the work of to
day or to-morrow; but it would need no
incredible miracle to make it the work of
some other day."

The men who took the money of
policy-holders in life insurance com
panies and gave it to party campaign
managers took what did not belong to
them and gave to men who had no
shadow of right â legal or moral â to re
ceive it.
.The receivers are equally guilty with
the givers, in a deal which both knew
to be plain theft â a deal which both
parties denied â proving their sense of
guilt â until one of them, the insurance
group, was forced to confession under
the lash of a legislative inquiry. The
fact that others had done the same
thing before, does not, cannot excuse
the act of the insurance managers, and
the apparent fact that they are unable
to feel the wrong in their act' stamps
them as moral idiots, unfit: further to
be trusted with anybody's * money. â

Miss May Sinclair, the author of that

In America. While she does not belong to
our country by birthT we have two
Btrongclaims upon her, for it was in
an American periodical, the New World
of December, 1693, that her first prose
article appeared. It was entitled "The
Ethical Import of Iflealism." Probably
our greater claim is that we first rec

thrngs' theatrical, and finally Belasco
â¢aid: "Fitz, I will give you Jl5OO for a
week's engagement at the AJhambra The
ater during Chrietmas week." Bob asked
for $2000. The upshot- of the discussion
was that Bob is to play at the Alhambra
during Christmas week in his drama, "A
Fight For Love," by Hal Reid, and is to
get JISOO for bis services If he Is defeated
by O'Brien. If Fits Is the winner Belasco

â¢ Possibly' in an effort to influence the
betting a report has been put in circula

fHE SAN FRANCISCO CALD, THURSDAY; ; DECEMBER 14, 1905;
SPEEDY CALLAGHAN IS NEVER HEADED
IN THE MIDLOTHIAN HANDICAP.
Graziallo, the Heavily Played Favorite,
Loses the Place to Rightful
Toupee Changes Hands.
Callahan, the cannon ball special, fly
ins the colors of James Nealon. and
with Sammy Greenfield at the throttle,
scampered oft with the $1000 Midlo
thian handicap over one and a sixteenth
miles yesterday at Insleside track.
The chestnut colt performed the feat
so strikingly that one finds himself ask
ing the question "How did Fireball ever
come to beat him at Oakland?" The
only explanation is that on the day he
met the "Williams sprinter Callaghan
must have had a Hat tire. .
"Look him in the eye," trainer* have
said referring to the Nealon horse, "and
he'll quit." The only opportunity af
forded any one of the other four starters
In the Midlothian /of accomplishing; this
trick came, as Callaghan cantered back
to the stand, after winning "easily by
four lengths in 1:47%. -[ . ;â¢" ; ,
GRAZIALLO A DISAPPOINTMENT.
Wondrous things were expected
of Graziallo. the 7 to 10 favo
rite, with 114 pounds to handle, and
the Columbia stable representative lost
the place to Rightful. His downfall
placed a frightful crimp in the talent.
Otherwise spectators had a banner
day, flve favorites returning with the
coin. Delightful weather drew another
large 'attendance.
Isabellita, a 13 to 10 choice with
Knapp up, put It all over her field in
the opening mile and a furlong selling
fixture. Knapp waited with the mare
the first part of the race, then won at
leisure. Iras nosed Expedient out of
the place,
grasscutter Wins cleverly.
It looked as if everybody unlimbered
on Grasscutter to win the two-year-old
sprint. The filly went to the post an
even money chance. She disposed of
Avonalis and Succeed in hollow fashion.
Keene Bros, started their patched
up three-year-old, Clandestine, in the
third, a flve-and-a-half-furlong spin, 1
and the gelding closed a slight favorite
over The Roustabout. Patsy Phillips
started off to make a flying getaway
of it with the St. Louis sprinter, Jake
"Ward. His attempt looked promising
for a time, when Radtke brought Clan
destine up, winning easily by more
than a length. Knapp finished third on
The Roustabout.
A rank outsider, Instructor, gave the
favorite. Toupee, a stiff argument In
the six-furlong selling affair. The

HUNTERS' RACE
IS PROPOSED
E. M. Tobin Offers a Cup to
Ec Competed For at
San Mateo New Year's Day
COKONADO CLUB ACTIVE
Officials Plan to Make
San Diego the Center
,of Polo in the South
The California Polo and Pony Racing
Association will start the new year well
with a meeting at San Mateo on the pri
vate track of Charles W. Clark on Janu
ary L The full details of the programme
will be decided upon at the annual meet-
Ing of the association next Monday.
R. M. Tobin, who Is an ardent huntlnr
man, has offered a cup for a three-mlla
flat race for hunters, four to start. The
weight would be 173 pounds. It has been
suggested that if the race be made a
hurdle affair, with three jumps to each
mile, the interest would be largely
Increased. A number of sportsmen, in
cluding J. Downey Harvey, Mr. Clark,
John Lawson, Lieutenant Lopez and oth
ers, have thoroughbreds which are quali
fied hunters and which are eligible to
start.
Paul Clagstone is at San Mateo with a
string of twelve ponies, three of which
he will ride In- the races, while the re
mainder will be played on the polo field.
The Coronado Country Club is prepar
ing to make San Diego the polo and "pony
racing center of the south. The club has
joined the Southern California Polo and
Pony Racing Association. Its first polo
tournament and races, an ambitious af
fair, will commence on March 1. Teams
are expected from Riverside, Los Angeles,
Santa Barbara, Santa Monica and possi
bly from Burllngame. The English play
ers who are coming with Mr. Mackey will
also probably take part.
A fine tournament polo field has been
built and a practice field is also to be
constructed.
The programme of races arranged by
the Southern California Association
contains some inconsistencies. There
are contradictions In some of the con
ditions which have been pointed out
to the framers by the officials of the
parent association in this city.
The southern officials contemplate
mixing amateur and professional riders
at their meeting. This is considered
ill advised as there will be plenty of
clever amateur riders among the polo
ists.
The big race of the meeting will be
for the John D. Spreckels challenge
cup over a distance of one and one
quarter miles. The cup must be won
three times. Each time it is won the
owner of the winner will receive a dup
licate of the cup in a miniature. The
rider of the winner will also receive a
cup each time to commemorate his vic
tory.
Cleanse and renovate the vital fluid (or
blood) and healthfully stimulate every
bodily function with Lash's Bitters. *
PRISON OFFICIALS REFUSE
TO HAJVD OVER A PRISOXER
Constable P. A. Glllln of Santa Cruz may
loee his job and incidentally be brought be
fore the Police Commissioners of this city to
answer for his conduct, as he Is drawing a
pension of $50 per month as a retired member
Of the department.
Glllln arrested "Walter E. Bamber in this
city on Tuesday evening on a . warrant from
Santa Cruz charging him with obtaining money
by false pretenses. Bamber was taken to the
City Prison to stay over night and yesterday
morning Glllln ' called to take him away. Ser
geant Bldwell declined to hand over the pris
oner on the . ground that Glllin was Intoxi
cated. Glllln telephoned to District Attorney
Knight of Santa Cruz that the prison authori
ties refused to part with Bamber. Knight
telephoned to headquarters for an explanation,
and when It was given he answered that hÂ»
would send a deputy sheriff for Bamber and
If Glllin appeared again at the prison to lock
him up.
Gillin Joined the force here in 1596 and was
retired on a pension through disability on
November 18, 1902. -He was running after a
thief when his .revolver fell out of his pocket
and exploded, the ball striking his foot. -

FOSTER SAVES
ON HIS WELCH
Secures Marin Landscape for
$322.50 Less That Schus
sler Bros. Had Demanded
SEAWELL DECIDES CASE
Holds That Salesman Junior
Overcharged the Well-
Known Eailroad President
"While casting no adverse reflection upon
the merit of the artiÃtic achievements of
Thad, Welch, Judge Seawell decided yes
terday" that A. W. Foster, president of
the California Northwestern Railroad,
was compelled by Schussler Bros., Geary
street art dealers, to pay $322 60 more for
a' Marin landscape from the brush of the
painter named than was just. ' The deci
sion is against Schuasler Bros., who,
after agreeing to supply Foster with a
.Welch for $350. presented him a bill: after
the delivery. of the same calling: for the
payment of f760. . â¢
While a great admirer of Welch's work,
the price demanded by Schussler Bros,
did not appeal to Mr. Foster, who values
his millions as highly as any othÂ«r mil
lionaire. A. representative of the firm, of
Schussler Bros, delivered the picture at
his residence, and professed to be over
joyed with the thought that so jnreat a
masterpiece had been executed for the
life-long pleasure of. its fortunate pos
sessor. With eloquence born of a desire
to connect with that $760, . in lieu of the
$350, this representative of the firm point
ed to the beauties, of the canvas. He
pointed to the drowsy herd bathed in the
warm light of the setting sun, and told
of the repose that would come to the soul
of the man that could look upon its beau
ties and drink in, along with his spark
ling wine, the peaceful inspiration that
seemed to radiate from the canvas.
So there was set up in the soul of Mr.
Foster two sharply conflicting' emotions,
the one born of his artistic temperament,
the other of his business experience. He
paid the $760, but made it understood that
the payment was under protest. Then hÂ«
went to court. He brought suit against
Schussler Bros for $410, the difference be
tween the agreed and tha actual cost of
the canvas. The suit was heard by Judge
Seawell.
During the trial it developed that Welch
was paid but $300 for his work, which was
executed at the request of Frederick Ju
nior, agent for Schussler Bros., who ;
struck the bargain with Foster for the
delivery of a Welch to him. for $350. In
his opinion Judge Seawell said that it
was patent that Junior had told Foster
that the picture would be delivered to
him at a cost of $350, and that this view
was fully borne out by Junior's state
ment to Foster when that price was
agreed upon, in which he said: "You are
entitled to .the best picture Welch can
paint, because you own so much land and
are president of a railroad." In conclu
sion Judge Seawell said:'
It is evident that the money received by Mr.
Welch for his painting was paid out of the
money of Mr. Foster. I believe that the de
fendants acted merely as agents In the mat
ter. In regard to the expense attached to the
trips Junior was obliged- to. make to San Ge
ronimo to commission^ Welch to paint the pic
ture, I am of the opinion- that $S0 will amply
cover It. 'The visits were made on Sundays
and did not take Junior away from his busi
ness. Certainly the salesman was of.no as
sistance to Welch while the latter was paint
ing the . nlcture. In view of. theso evident
facts I will order judgjnent for the plaintiff
in the sum of $322 SO. .. .
The difference between the sum of the
judgment and the sum demanded by Fos
ter, the court held, was represented in
the difference in value between the frame
originally selected by Mr. Foster and that
finally accepted by him.

It Is Accused of Giving
llebates to Packing Firm
OEEICLVLS INVOLVED
Said to Have Made Conces
sions to Schwarzschild &
Sulzberger, Beef Barons
CHICAGO, Dec. 13.â The Federal
Grand. Jury to-day returned an Indict
ment against the Chicago and Al
ton Railroad \u25a0 Company, John W.
FaJthorn and â¢F. A. Warm, tor
merly â¢ vice prÂ«Â»ident and general
freight agent respectively of the
railroad ; company. The railroad
company' and '.the two officials are in
cluded In one indictment, in which there
are ten counts against the company and
against caoh of the two men. The
charge is that the railroad company
with the sanction of the two officials,
paid' lllegal rebates to the packing
house firm of Schwarzschild & Sulz
berger for the purpose of procuring
shipments from the concern and also
with the name object gave free trans
portation to tho employes of the con
cern. :.-;''>
The indictment is based on testimony
given to the Grand Jury by B. S. Cusey,
traffic manager for Schwarzschild A
Sulzberger, who has appeared before
the Grand Jury on two separate oc
casions. Cusey. was one of four em
ployes of the packing house firm who
were indicted some time ago for solicit
ing rebates. All of them pleaded guilty.
,Cusey. with two others, was fined
$5000 each and Samuel Weil, one of the
vice presidents of the company, was
flnÂ»;d $10,000 by Judge Humphrey.
Tnrce specific violations of the law
against the granting of rebates are
mentioned in the indictment. The rail
road company is charged with having
refunded $1 per car on forty-four cars
of dressed beef shipped from Kansas
City to various Eastern points in De
cember, 1908. A similar rebate Is al
leged to have been paid on 23 cars of
dressed beef .shipped from Kansas City
in January. 1904. The railroad com
pany is also charged with having re
funded jn.",00 in. passenger fares paid by
the packing company between January
1, 1903, and September 1, 1904. for trans
portation of its officers and agents.
Neither Falthorn nor Warm was ar
rested, but they were informed of the
fact that an indictment had been voted
against them, and were notified to come
into court and give bonds.
United States District Attorney Mor
rison declared that he .would ask each
man to give bonds to the \ amount of
$5000. The railroad company will be
asked to enter an appearance through
one of Its general officials.

SINGAPORE, Straits Settlement. Dec.
13.â The Chinese dock laborers at
Tangjon^- Pagar to-day refused to aid
In repairing the Standard Oil Com

THE COPPER STOCKS.
BOSTON. Dec 13.â T0-day witnessed the
moet wild and erratic movement that we have
yet had. North Butte opened at &6 and sold up
rspiuiy a point at a time to 83. with a subse
quent reaction to &OH. The books are closed
ca the stock and odd lots are very scarce, so
that to-day dealers had to refuse to execute
order* ia less tfcaa 60 shares. Copper Range
Is again very active, with an advaace of five
point* over lut nljat. New York appeared
as a big buyer cf Greene Copper and the stock
ahewed a three point advance.

Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO. Dec 13.â Trading in wheat was
well under way to-day before weakness devel
oped. During the first hour feeling in, the pit
was bullish. May opened 14 Â§?ie higher at
83VsC?S9iJc, and on demand from pit traders
and short* the price rose to S9Â«ic. A report
from Argentina that weatner was not entirely
favorable for harvesting uras one reason for
the firmness. Another was reports of drouth
in India. As the session advanced offerings
Increased In volume. Much of the selling was
done by commission houses with Northwestern
connection*. This celling was due to a belief
that the railroads would be able to furnish cars
In the near future which would result In a
largely increased supply. * later the market
was further weakened en reports that export
demand was very light. The market closed
weak with May %c off at SSHc.
Small local receipts held the corn market
steady early in the day, but selling by cash
bouses and pit traders soon caused a decline.
May opened a ehade to He higher at 445&
44fic. cold off to 43}Â»Â©44c, and closed lig'&e
lower az 44c.
In oats the demand was less brisk and local
receipts were larger. May opened a shade to
>4c higher at 32HÂ©32Â»ic declined to 32Uc and

Hay and FeedstaSft.
Bran is easy owing to the -current large ar
rivals from the north, but quotations remain
unchanged. Dealers report a better feeling ia
Hay owing to light receipts, but say that, al
though there is a heavy feeding demand In the
country due to the lack of grass, stocks there
are so large that they can satisfy that demand
for a long time yet without disturbing the
market. The circular of Soroers 4 Co. 6ays:
"There is practically nothing new coneem
lrg tha condition of the Hay market during
tha week, receipts amounting to 2530 tens,
about the same quantity that .arrived last
week. All the country Hay districts are doing
their bÂ«et to market their Hay, but arÂ» still
prevented from doing so only by the continu
ance of the car famine, which is '\u25a0 rather un
usual for this time of the year. If the pres
ent conditions continue it wfll be impossible
to marktt all the Hay stored in the country
warehouses before next year's crop Is ready
to be stored. -
- "General trade in Hay still continues rather
dull; stock Hay rules firm, bowtver. as Is also
the cas* with strictly fancy, of which there
is bat little offering. The bulk of the ship
ments are the medium grades, which may he
said to determine the market at present. Tha
demand for Hay in the outside country points
still continues to Increase and undoubtedly will
continue to do co, for we are beginning to
hear the talk of 'dry year,' and most cer
tainly, unless we have : rein before a very
great while, the market will ba affected, even
though there is a vast amount of Hay stored
In the publlo warehouses throughout the State.

day. Really fancy Burbanks are= very scarce
atxl pass l out of first hands as fast as , they
esine- in. â¢ but there : is very , little doing jin
cheap stock. Similar-conditions prevail ln:the
market for Sweet Potatoes, fresh arrivals of
choice stock v being ; in good . demand at $1 25
per \u25a0 cental, while : trashy > lots ' are slow f of j sale
at 50ce*l:. Onions were a Uule easier yes
terday and ' the top quotation was shaded. : . ;
The market was amply, supplied with, south-
em vegetables and changes in prices were
slight.- - Cabbage. Carrots and Winter Squash

â¢ There was continued firmness in all kinds
of Poultry, notably in Chickens, and close
clearances o' desirable stock - were readily
effected at stiff prices. Receipts for the day
were about 90 coops and consisted chiefly of
Chicksns. Thirty-Â©nÂ« cases of drassed Turkeys
came in and were promptly disposed of at
satisfactory prices- . Game remained weak, al
though the receipts were comparatively light.

Bsgs" were again advanced on the exchange
yesterday, as will be seen. Ranch Bggs con
tinue as icarce as ever, and some houses are
receiving none at all. As long as the rain
holds r.rf and the cold weather continues . the
production will probably continue light. Butter
was also advanced' half a point., with a sale
at 30c There was no change In Cheeee^ but
supplies are still light and thÂ« market, like
those for Butter and Eggs, rules firm.

Deciduous and Citrus Fmlts.
The market for fresh fruits reflected the
conditions which prevailed on the preceding
day. The large sizes of Navel Oranges, 9Cs
to 2165, were scarce' and ia good demar.d at
full figured, while small sizes, that Is. 150s ta
2165, were abundant and slow of sale at un
even prices. The ether Citrus goods showed
no change worthy of note, there being no par
ticularly brisk demand for anything. Fancy
Lemons and big sizes of Grape Fruit vere
rather fcarce. The Apple market was In good
shape, with trade of good proportions, and the
best offerings of the most favored varieties
readily commanded firmer prices. Persimmons
were plentiful and easy and Pears rather dull.
Stocks of Grapes consisted chiefly of old stocK
for which there was practically no market. A
few chests of Strawberries came in and sold
slowly In a peddling way at easy rates.

SEASON OF GENEROSITY
BRINGS FAMILY JAR.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
After she had crooned the fretful
baby to sleep Mrs. Olive Poletz whis
pered to her husband Charles that the
Yuletide yearning to give away things
possessed her and she would like to
have the money necessary to gratify it.
"Chrlstmas'll be here before we know
where we are," she softly murmured,
"an* I haven't a blessed cent to buy a
blessed present for anybody."
"This annual swapping of merchan
dise makes me tired," responded Mr: !
Poletz, looking up from his newspaper
to emphasize his seriousness.
"But. everybody does it an' we must
be like other. people if we don't want
to lose every friend we have on earth,"
the lady rejoined- in- tone acidulous and
slightly elevated." . '
"You needn't get mad about it,"
growled x Mr. Poletz, "an' you'd better
lower your voice if you don't want to
have another time puttin' that kid to
sleep."
He resumed perusal of the newspa
per, thereby intending to notify Mrs.
Poletz that the debate was closed, but
she ignored the hint. *.
"If you don't want to have friends
I do," she announced, bravely trying
to repress inclination to shout the
words.
"If I can't have friends without
loadin' 'em up with store goods once a
year I don't want to have 'em." Mr.
Poletz declared. "Besides/ I ain't got
no money to squander, an* I won't
have, none till I get that $30 the Gov
ernment owes me."
"You won't get that $30' before
Christmas, . but we can buy* what "'we
want on the installment plan," Mrs.
Poletz suggested.
"We don't want nothin' on the in
stallment plan," was Mr. Poletz's. re
sponse, "an', what's more, we don't get
nothin' on the installment plan." â¢
"M-i-s-e-r \u25a0" hissed Mrs. Poletz. and
so loud was the sibilant-jsound that- It"
awoke the infant, who celebrated its
return to consciousness by emitting a
prolonged wail. . \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0
â¢ "You went an' done it â didn't you?"
thundered Mr. Poletz, 'addressing his
better half, and ere she could frame
reply he administered a stinging slap
to one of her cheeks.
When she had rehushed the babe to
slumbor Mrs. Poletz caused her hus
band's arrest on the charge of battery,
and to Police Judge Mogan the story
of the assault was told in piecemeal
as it is above narrated in coherence. ;
"With Christmas so near^at hand I'd
hate to have him sent to Jail," said
Mrs. Poletz to the Judge.
â¢ "All right," quoth . his Honor, "I'll
dismiss the case, but I would advise
you, Mrs. Poletz, to abstain from re

Conjecture as ta how Frank Perley
I (colored) managed to carry the plun
der he was accused of having: stolen
from the dwelling of Mrs. Dollie Whit
ney, 2975 California street, remains
j rife, for Mr. Perley himself declines to
' settle it.
"Doan esk me no sich ponpostus
queskin," he haughtily said to an in
quisitive officer of Judge â¢ Mogan's
court, "fo" I'se gwine teh prove en al
bany." , '
' Said plunder consisted of one suit of
clothes, eighteen cans of preserved
salmon, twe'ity-one yards of carpet and
a large and heavy rocking-chair. The
canned salmon was subsequently found i
in Mr. Perley's bachelor apartment at 736
Pacific street, and his explanation of its
presence there may be a portion of his
promised "albany." That all the loot was
taken at- one time is the opinion of its
owner and also that of . two detectives,
which unity of opinion serves to ac
centuate the mystery that la the most
interesting feature of the case. 1 â¢
"Was there a fire in the kitchen range
when the marauder was there?" Judge
Mogan asked the detectives, the object of
the query probably being, to elicit enlight
enment as to why the .Article mentioned
was not also feloniously carried away.
But. the detectives were unable to convey
the desired information.
'.'Wen Ise ready teh spring mah al
bany," Mr. Perley notified the court,
"Ah'U want a 'tohney, ob mah own s'lec
tion teh do de talkin*. En Ah doan mine
sayin' right' heah dat w'en de talkin' kim
mences Ise gwine teh mek some ob dese
smaht cops wish teh gracious dey'd neb
bah bin bohn."
"All right," said the Judge; "we'll set
December 15, which is next Friday, as
the date on which . you shall be afforded
opportunity to make these detectives re
gret their birth."
"On dat yah date," Mr. Perley declared,
"dah'll sholy be suffln' doin'."
Undeterred by knowledge that eight
of their brethren in vagabondage were
recently arrested ana punished for'
haunting the Chicago Beer Hall at
Third and Howard streets and thus an
noying the- proprietors thereof, eleven
full-blown "hoboes" committed the
same offense at the same place last
Tuesday evening anu -were scooped in
by Patrolmen Sequin and. Nolan. When
placed before Judge Fritz the hapless
eleven were given, opportunity to ex- \
plain, but only one of them was dis
missed, the remainder getting terms
of Imprisonment'' in accord , with their
respective records. "\u25a0 â¢ â¢\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0-'
The heavily -muscled young man,
who was employed to alternate his vo
cation of bartending with,the task of
ejecting ngn-purchasing loungers from
the Chicago Beer Hall, appeared in
court with a disabled right arm, the
member having been severely wrenched
by one of the gentlemen undergoing
expulsion suddenly twisting in his cap<
tor's grasp. It was' announced that an
equally brawny substitute is keeping
the tattered procession moving while
the regular human catapult is inca
pacitated for such arduous labor.
W. G.Robblns, who accused Miss
Kate Jones of having robbed him of a
diamond pin valued at $200,/ was so
deaf - while on .the witness", stand in
Judge Conlan's court that his Honor
ahid two 'attorneys wejre made hoarse
by endeavoring to make their ques
tions I intelligible to him.
"Is your name Bobbins?" the Judge
yelled at him. ,
"No," was the. reply, delivered in high
key; "I didn't do the robbin". She
did." .
Then with hand placed behind right
ear, he told".the court that he is a race
track habitue and dwells at 359 O'^ar
rell street, the apartment adjoining
that rented by him having been occu
pied by the defendant at the time of
the alleged robbery. While dressing
himself that fateful morning he found
that a necktie, which he had Just pur
chased, was too narrow to conveniently
hold his diamond pin, * so ; he dropped
the treasure into- a side pocket of his
pantaloons, intending ;to buy a wider
cravat when he w.ent forth. Then he
noticed that his mustache was in need
of curling and it occurredto him that
his fair next-door, neighbor, with whom
he had more than once "passed the time
of : day." might have af? curling iron
among her possessions, '; so \u25a0he went to
her chamber door and . inquired ; if . his

Police of Three Cities Are
Yet in the Dark as to
Motives That Led to the
Murder of Sausalito Man
SHERIFF ADVANCES
A PLAUSIBLE THEORY
W. P. Taylor Believes That
Crime Was Committed vto
Avenge Killing of Sail
or on the Cutter Bear
The remains of Francis Hall McGrath
that were found lying dead on the
rocks of the Oakland mole last Thurs
day will be Interred to-day. The po
lice authorities of three cities have no
solution of. the mystery. All that is
known is that he was last seenÂ«in this
city on Wednesday, December 6, and
that he was Francis Hall McGrath of
Sausalito. 'â¢ .
Effort's have been made to discredit
the identification of , McGrath's body,
which ' was made " b^' Poundmaster
Charles Bright of Sausalito. It is now
asserted that McGrath had some faint
tattoo marks on his left arm. r
Sheriff Taylor of San Rafael, vrho bad
McGrath In custody twice on charges
of manslaughter, Maid yesterday: "I am
positive that â¢ there were no tattoo
marks on McGrath's person.' I saw him
stripped to the waist KCveral time* and
am certain that if there were any I
would ' have noticed them. I believe
that the body In that of McGrath and I
shouldn't wonder that be was killed
by friends of George Taylor of the
Rear. Threats were made at the fu
neral by friends of Taylor that they
would 'get' McGrath." -
One of McGrath's Sausalito friends de
clared yesterday that McGrath had a
tooth filled with gold In this city only
a few months ago. A left upper incisor
in the dead man's mouth had been re
cently filled with gold. This was a point
that puzzled Charles Bright, because the
work was done after he lost track of
XO CLEW OX BODY.
"No clew to the murder was found
on the /-body, nor was' there anything
left in the clothing to identify the man.
The motive .was not robbery: the Oak
land police are satisfied of that. There
remains but one theoryâ the one held by
Sheriff Taylor, that it was revenge.
I^ast Monday a letter was received by
thg local police authorities which de
clared that the body of the man found
on the mole was that of Francis Hall
McGrath. Yesterday some one tele
phoned to Captain of Detectives Burnett
that the body was not McGrath's, and
that McGrath had tattoo marks on his
arm.
The man refused to give his name^and
declared that ho would "ring up. later."
He did not do so.
Who wrote that letter? Who, tele
phoned that message? These are two
problems for the police authorities of
Oakland. San Francisco and Sausalito

to solve. No progress has been made

' When the letter was received by the
local police. Sergeant Tim Bainbridgo
went to Oakland and saw .the body. He
could not recognize it. Bainbridge did
not know McGrath. That night Pound
master Charles Bright of Sausalito saw
the remains. Tie recognized the body as
that of McGrath with whom he had
been very Intimate.
'McGrath had been threatened. He told
Bright so when he left Sausalito. Friends
of George Taylcr, a sailor on the revenue
cutter Bear, whom McGrath had kill
ed in a fist fight over a dog, had threat
ened to "get him." When McGrath left
Sausalito last December he was in fear
of his life.
While he was in Sausalito he was be- |
friended by Mrs. Lena Welk. a pretty
candy girl employed at the Haas candy
store. The day before his body was
found on the mole he called at the store
and asked for her. That was the last
that was seen of him alive.
Mrs. Welk admitted that she knew him,
but denied that she .had seen him of
late. This is contradicted by a girl who
works with her in the store. McGrath
visited her at the store about 10 weeks
ago. He called to see her on the day
that he was murdered.
SLOW* TO SEE THINGS.
Reluctance to accept the McGrath
identification Is probably the reason,
that no progress has been made toward
clearing up the mystery. There is' no
dVubt that it was murder. A man who
has shot himself through the head can
not conceal a pistol. There was no
pistol found near the body of McGrath.
The inquest will be held to-day.
Poundmaster Charles Bright, who
identified the body.' will be one of the
chief witnesses.
The funeral of McGrath was to have
taken place yesterday, but it was post
poned until to-day. It was thought
that some of McGrath's former friends
In Sausalito would go over and more
thoroughly establish the identification.
, Mrs. Welk did not appear at Haas'
candy' store yesterday. When inquiry
was made for her at her residence, 1454
O'Farrell street, last night It was said
that she was not at home.
â¢Late last night it was decided by the
Oakland' Coroner to hold the body of
McGrath another day, though It has be
gun to decompose. -A strenuous effort
will be -made to have Bright's identifi
cation of McGrath even more substan
tially v corroborated.
