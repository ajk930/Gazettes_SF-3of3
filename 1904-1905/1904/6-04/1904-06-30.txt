ST. LOUIS, June 29. â Some one. has
drawn a keen blade across the folds of
M. F. Tarpey's hot-air balloon, and the
craft that has been bearing the Hearst
Pacific Coast boomlet is hanging tail
upward somewhere in the jungle west
of the Rockies. A message received
to-day by the management of the Jef
ferson Hotel from Tarpey canceled .the
engagement of all rooms but the head
quarters and five sleeping apartments,
each of the latter to contain- three -cots.
In view of the fact that the, weather
here is noted for its r.lsorption >and
retention of caloric, it is safe to assume
that but one Democrat will . occupy
each of the cots. Thus, by a calcula
tion that goes no- farther, than plain
multiplication, it is plain that but fif
teen of the faithful from California
and Arizona are expected.- The craft
,that carried .Tarpey's vision of imperial

GREAT DAY AT HARVARD.
NEW YORK. June 29. â Wall street
is beginning to take an interest in the
national political situation. In the
dullness which has seized stock spec
ulation interest in market develop
ments has given place to discussion as
to the Democratic nominee at the; St.
Louis convention. To-day the prevail
ing differences of opinion found . ex
pression In the curb market, where a
score or more. of bets were made.
Grover Cleveland's name anjjeared
with surprising persistency in the
terms of the wagers. There is at
least $16,000 waiting to be wagered at
odds of 1 to 2% that hi* will be the
Democratic nominee. Those who dif
fer on the point, hor*>ver, are willing
to concede only 2 to 1 that Cleveland
will not be named.
Six or seven bets were made indi
cating that in the event of Cleveland's
nomination it. was an even chance be
tween him - and " Roosevelt. C. M.
Minzesheimer said he had $10,000 to
wager that Cleveland would defeat
Roosevelt in case the former were
nominated and consented to run. A
customer of Sjternberger, Sinn & Co.
placed $400 even money on Roosevelt
against Cleveland. W. C. Moore, a
curb broker, bet $100 even with Louis
Heineman on Cleveland. . Another in
teresting bet was $100 even that either
McClellan or.Cleyeland jwould be the
nominee^ -
One of the matters most commented
upon in â¢ the . financial district was the
force of the Cleveland boom. The
warehouses had it that the ticket
would be Cleveland and Francis.

It was believed by the delegates
after the send-off at Reno last even
ing that that probably would exhaust
the Hearst shouting In Nevada, but
when the little village of Wells was
reached this morning things broke loose
again. Some enterprising Democrats
of that town had gathered some fire
works together and gave the train a
full Presidential salute of twenty-one
bombs as it pulled in. The crowd was
small in number but large in noise and
enthusiasm.
It was expected that the Utah dele
gation would join the train at Ogden,
but the delegates from the Mormon
State failed to materialize." It r -was
stated at the station that they haÂ«l
concluded to flock by themselves and
go on a day or so later.
Chairman of the delegation M. F.
Tarpey this morning announced - the
following committees, which he was
authorized to name at the meeting of
the delegation in San Francisco on
May 4:
XOISY WELLS DEMOCRATS.
Sheriff James A. Keys probably whl
be selected to act on the committee on
credentials. There will be a good deal
of "scrapping" on that committee, but
the Sheriff says that is what he likes.
Handsome "Joe" Simons of Los An
geles is being urged by his friends for
a vice chairman of the convention.
"Joe's" friends say he ought i to look
well upon the platform, and .there
seems little doubt that he will be se
lected. * \ .-'..*
R. H. de Witt, the genial delegate
from the First District, is mentioned
for California's member of the commit
tee on notification of the Presidential
nominee.
Messrs. Delmas, Tarpey and Senator
Newlands of Nevada were closeted to
day for some time with Carl Hayden,
the probable chairman of the Arizona
delegation, who is making the journey
with the Californians. Hayden is par
ticularly concerned about a plank in
the platform dealing with separate
statehood for his Territory and New
Mexico, and supplies these gentlemen,
already quite conversant with the sub
ject, with additional data so they will
be in a position to aid him in. the com
mittee on platform and resolutions.
The friends of D. W. Carmlchael,
delegate at large from Northern Cali
fornia, say that he will be made a
member of the committee on rules.
As none, of the delegates from South
ern California are on the train no for
mal meeting of the delegation will be
had until the convention city is
reached. It is conceded on all sides
that Tarpey will again be elected na
tional committeeman, and that D. M.
Delmas will be California's representa
tive on the committee on platform and
resolutions.
GREEN RIVER, Wyo., June 29.â
Things are warming up on the Hearst
special from Californiaâ not on account
of the weather, which has been re'ally
pleasant for the alkali wastes the train
has been passing over, but an under
current of "things doin* " in the dele
gation politics is decidedly noticeable.
M. F. Tarpey, Mr. Hearst's Western
representative, seemingly has the sit
uation well in hand, and the McNabites
are apparently debating whether it
wouldn't be wiser to follow their chief's
illustrious example and give their whis
pering boss the double cross and pos
sibly thus succeed in breaking in on*
some of the good things the delegation
has to give out. Tarpey has too vivid
a recollection of recent trusts reposed
in the wily Scotchman, and his follow
ing, though. _to be easily persuaded to
take their promises to "deal fair."
After Santa Cruz, he is convinced
that the only kind of a McNablte who
can be trusted on a programme is one
by proxy, and it is said he isn't any too
sure that wouldn/t be revoked if the
telegraph service were a little cheaper.'
So. W. J. McGee, who is said to be Mc-
Nab's candidate for Governor in 1906,
and McNab'8 messenger, "Treasurer"
'Louis Mooser, are not running very
strong in their effort to get important
appointments from the delegates. It is
rumored that Mooser may announce
himself . for treasurer of the National
Committee, but li so his fight has taken
no more- definite shape than a wild
longing on his part.
TARPEY TO SUCCEED HIMSELF.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Just theh a tug passed, sending "a
heavy wash against the boat. As soon
as the water splashed into the sub
marine boat's interior it created a panic
among the novices and one of them
tried to get out of the manhole, which
the older hands were screwing dowr.
preparatory to the descent, the sub
merging department having already
been opened. The water rushed In and
as the submerged vessel sank like a
stone the officers and ?ome of the men
were only saved by being blown up
through the manhole by the rush* of
escaping air.
The Delfin shortly afterward' was
raised. Lieutenant Klagsuin, who was
one of the officers saved, said:
"The tragedy was like a dream. I
remember a sickening' sense of suffo
cation from the fumes of the storage
batteries and then a rush of air and
water. The next thing I knew was
that I was ashore."
The Delfin is Russia's best submarine
boat. She was designed by Naval
Architect Boubnoff apd Captain Bek
lemlsheff and underwent a successful
trial in 1D03.
The officers and men detailed for
submarine boat instruction had as
sembled at the Baltic yard and three
officers decided to go down in the Del
fin, although her captain was not pres
ent, relying upon the experience of her
skilled crew. A score of novices were
anxious to go with the three officers.
The Delfin's nominal capacity is ten
men, instead of which thirty-two en
tered the boat, bringing: her manhole
in dangerous prox.inity to the river
level.
ST. PETERSBURG, June 25.â The
submarine boat Delfin sank at her
moorings in the Neva, off the Baltic
Shipbuilding Yard, at 11 o'clock this
morning, with the loss of Lieutenant
Cherkasoff and twenty men. The ac
cident was due, partly, to the exces
sive number of the crew, mostly inex
perienced men, and chiefly Ur the un
fortunate attempt of a man to escape
while his comrades were screwing
down the manhole.
Parker's friends were., first on the
p round here. Representative John
fcharp Williams, one of the delegates
at larpe from Miseissippi and at the
head of an tastnx&ed Parker delega
tion, says no doubt there will be a land
elide to the New York jurist.
The Parker tide is rising higher and
higher in the T'est. The Illinois, dele
gation, which 's instructed to voteÂ«ror
Hearst, is seeking some way of escapt
ing these instructions, so that it can
eolidly vote for Parker on the 'first
ballot.
The theory ol the Parker men is that
their candidate w'Jl get npt only the
tzi votes Â£iver. lÂ£ the table, but Z?A
votes controlled by Gray. Olney, Gor
man, Cockrci! a.i..1 Wall, which will
make: his total vote 754, or S7 more than
the necessary two-thirds. â¢
This libt dots not include the full con
servative strength of the convention by
no votes* It excludes from the Parker
column the 6 votes of Delaware, which
will be cast for Judge Gray, olthough
he is personally in favor of Judge Par
ker.. It :uJ;es no Account of the sixteen
votes of Maryland and fourteen of
West Virginia, which are suppo,Â«?Â«u to
be ne!d by Gorman, although Senator
Gorman says he is not opposing Parker.
It does not take into account thirty
two votes from Maes; 7:husetts. which
ere instructed for Olney, yet it is said
Massachusetts will support Parker iu
eecond ballot, if not on Â»he first! It
leaves out thirty-six votes for Senator
CockrtH in Missouri, though in ail
probability Parker vlll get. them on the
teoond ballot. It dues no? c take in t u .e
twenty-six votes of Wi&xeisin. which
are instructed for Wall, but vÂ«hich are
conservative and are relied o on for Par
ker at the proper time.
Spsc.a! Dispatch to The Call. .
ST. LUU1S. June 29.â It would seem
that there is no doubt about Judge Par

ported that Chikwanshan; Chitanshan
and Sochoshan,. three forts on the south
east part of the Port Arthur. defenses,
were captured by the Japanese on Sun

number of their wounded has not been
ascertained.
j The Japanese force consisted of all
branches of the service. The Japanese
lost three officers and one hundred men
killed' or' wounded, and captured two

j KAICHINjG, June 29.â The Japanese
are continuing to advance from Siuyen
and Fengwangcheng." General Oku "also
is moving north- from Senuchen. Gen
eral-Samsonoff Is contesting his pro
gress, but is not offering serious re
sistance." The Japanese force advanc
ing from the Motien pass is composed
of at least three regiments and ten bat
teries of artillery.
The Russian fleet is now reported
to consist of six battleships, five cruis
ers and twenty-four smaller vessels.
On June 23, the day on which the
Europeans left, the Japanese were re
ported to be trying to .capture Wolf
Mountain, a -strongly fortified position
fifteen miles from Port Arthur.
A Frenchman, who has been in Port
Arthur since the siege begun, says
that there are 50,000 fighting men there,
including soldiers, sailors and volun
teers; 500 women and 130 non-combat
ants. The women and non-combatants
are waiting for asteamsnip on which
the Russians will take them out.
The food supply is good. The only
sufferers are the Chinese Inhabitants,
who are without money.
CHEFU, June 30.â Fifty Europeans
who left Port Arthur on June 23 ar
rived here to-day from Pigeon Bay.
where they embarked on June 28. They
report that in the naval engagement
of June 23 the Russian battleship Se
vastopol was slightly damaged. Fif
teen days will be required to repair
her. The torpedo dispatch-boat Amur
also was badly damaged.
When the Russian fleet went out of
Port Arthur the hopes or all the resi
dents were high and there was much
disappointment when the fleet returned
to anchorage. It is said that the Rus
sian sailors have no confidence in Rear
Admiral Wlthoeft, but think that if
Vice Admiral Skrydloff were in com
mand the fleet could successfully en
gage the Japanese.

being stampeded to or from any man.
If; it is right that this convention
choose the grand old Indian fighter
(prolonged applause and cheers) who
Â¦was turned aside by the hero of San
Juan .Hill with a sneer although no
mark stood against .him, well and good.
If we do not choose to do that, we need
not confine ourselves to military men."
At the opening of the evening ses
sion several singers were heard, one
song, advocating putting General
Miles in the White House, and this
brought 'an enthusiastic demonstra
tion. About one-third of the delegates
stood and cheered,. .waving flags and
hats- for several minutes.
The convention was called to order
by National Chairman .Oliver W. Stew
art of Chicago.^ In presenting the Rev.
George XV. Peake of Sandusky, Ohio, to
make the opening prayer, he said:
v.ould be fatal to the party, as he was
a. Democrat and would not control
the entire party vote. Those opposed
to him will fight the nomination to
the last ditch.
The resolutions committee was in
session from early in the afternoon
until a late hour to-night without
coming to n. final agreement.
The convention opened to-day in
Tomblinson Hall with 2000 delegates,
alternates and visitors present. The
hall was decorated with the national
colors. Over the platform was hung
pictures of Abraham Lincoln, Clinton
IS. Fiske and Frances Willard. Around
the hall were pictures of Hale John
son, Samuel B. Peterson, Sheriff of
Cumberland County, Maine, who gained
a high place in the estimation of the
Prohibitionists by his vigorous enforce
ment of the law. ' *

Spec.a'i Dispatch to The Call
Haven was considered rich, but de
velopments show his financial affairs
to be in a bad state. The first news
the Rampart public had of this was
when his widow told her friends that
she was penniless and wanted assist
ance in securing work.
Charles Birchler, administrator of
the estate, believes that Haven inten
tionally left his affairs in a mixed up
condition. His iron box, deposited In
the Northern Commercial Ce-mpany's
safe, was believed to contain gold dust,
but nails were found in it. In securing
credit for a lot of goods,- Haven had
exhibited a big roll of bills a few weeks
beibre his death. Investigation showed
that this roll comprised a large num
ber of dollar bills, which Mrs. Haven
subsequently turned over to the ad
ministrator for the payment of debts.
Haven is thought to have created a
false impression regarding his wealth
as the basis for securing credit while
conducting a large mining enterprise.

of a fortune in gold dust, Robert Hav
en's strong box was found to contain

SAN JOSE, June 29. â An excursion
train conveying 1500 members of the
St. Francis de Sales parish of Oakland
to Sunset IJark was wrecked near
Alma, in the Santa Cruz Mountains,
this forenoon. Almost miraculously
none of the passengers were injured.
In some unaccountable manner two
cars jumped the track and the engine
went over an embankment. The
twelve other cars, that were heavily
laden with women and children, re
mained on the rails.
The accident occurred just above
Alma, at the old tunnel. The engineer
and fireman saved themselves by
jumping. For a time there was almost
a panic among the passengers. Rev.
Father McSweeney, ~ pastor of the
church, was present and he quieted the
parishioners. The track was blocked
by the wreck. An engine pulled the
excursion train back to Los Gatos and
the picnic was held in Bunker Hill

483 and 485 Broadway, extending

building and the "damage inflicted by
fire, water and smoke was estimated at
between $150,000 and $200,000. The fire
was so situated that it was difficult to
fight until It had burned over an hour.
The material was so dense that the
firemen could work . In it only for a
few minutes at a time and many of
those who braved it fell prostrate where
they stood. Some who fell lay un
noticed on the floor for many minutes
and one man remained for nearly an
hour before finally discovered and
dragged to the open air to be cared for
by a large relief force which had been
summoned. The breaking of gas mains
inside the building and the consequent
filling of the burning structure with
thousands of cubic feet of illuminating
gas added greatly to the difficulty and
the danger. \ ' . .â¢> â¢, =

By Sally Sharp.
A stunning maid was Miss Rose Ellen
Ilecht! As a bride in her nuptial trap
pings she was exquisite.
Enshrined in a bower of pink bebe
roses and blue chiffon, the fair bride
plighted her troth to her chosen one,
Simon Walter Frank.
The ceremony was performed at the
Hecht home on Washington street by
the Rev. Dr. Voorsanger, a hundred
friends witnessing the joyous rite.
The Parisian color scheme of pink
and blue, a blending so often seen in
the summer sky, was borne out in the
hall, the drawing-room and the dining
roomâa pretty setting for some very
smart gowns.
The bride wore an exquisite robe of
soft shimmery satin, with a bertha of
old point lace. She * wore a veil and
bore a shower bouquet of orchids In
her arms. She was attended by her
sitter, Miss Grace Hecht, who wore a
fetching frock of sheer batiste and va
lenciennes and carried maidenhair and
mignonetteâ a refreshing departure
from the usual floral adornment of the
honor-maid.
Mrs. Mark Gerstle and Mrs. William
Gerstle, sisters . of the bride, were
smartly gowned, the former in white
batiste, embroidered in pinkâ a color,
by the way, suiting her dark beauty
wellâ and' the latter wearing a whltft
lace robe.
The young folk left soon after the
congratulations for the southâ the
Mecca of loversâ where they will re
main for a few weeks, going thence to
the home of Mr. Frank in Baltimore,
where a joyous reception awaits them
from the relatives and friends of the

BERLIN. June 2*. â The German
gunboat Panther, now at Newport
NÂ«Â»ws. has received orders by cable to
sail for Port au Prince to-day. The
sailing of the Panther for Port au
. - Â¦ Â¦
Prince is due to the decision of Ger
many t<; ir.Fi.st on the punishment of
the palace guards, who recently threw
Ftones nt the German and French Min
isters while the latter were driving
past the palace.
POUT AU PRINCE, June 29.â The
French cruiser Jurien de la Graviere
will arrive here on July 1.
WASHINGTON*, June 29.â The State
Department has taken note of the press
reports of the dispatch of warships by
France and Germany to Hayti to com
pel reparation for the attack upon
French and German Ministers recently
in Port au Prince. The department
has not been formally advised of the
intentions of France and Germany, but
assumes that those reports are per
fectly correct. Following its invariable
rule in such cases, the department will
not intervene unless some act is com
mitted that appears to be beyond the
bounds of strict justice.
It is said that the State Department
never has taken the ground that the
smaller republics ought to be protected
by the United States as against re
clamations by European . powers for
violated contract obligations or against
proper demands arising out of viola
tions in international obligations, such
as it is alleged are involved in this at
tack on the foreign Ministers.
Developments will be watched with
keen interest to see that, the line is
properly drawn and undue punishment
is not afflicted. It is not doubted that
the Haytian Government will supple
ment its inadequate letter of apology
by punishing the guilty guards when it
realizes that It cannot look for inter
vention by this country.

That newspapers sometimes engage in un
warranted criticism of the courts cannot be
denied. 1 .In some Instances they construe the
liberty of the press as a license to authorize
them to engage in wholesale abuse of the
courts, but these Instances are rare and do not
warrant a departure fr6m the well-settled
principles of the law- as declared by Con
gress and construed by the courts. If a Judge
charged with the administration of the law
Is not to be criticized on account of his
official conduct the liberty â¢ of the press Is
abridged and the rights of individuals Im
periled.
There may be Instances where- the publica
tion of editorials or other matter In news
papers would bring the. author within the
limitations of the statute. For Instances. If
a newspaper should publish an article con
cerning a trial which was being considered
by a jury and. should send a copy of the paper
containing such article to the jurymen thereof
during the progress of the trial for the purpose
of Influencing them In their decision, it would
present a question whether such conduct would
not be misbehavior In the presence of the
court, or so near thereto as to obstruct the
administration of justice.
It appears that the distinguished judge who
adjudged the petitioner to be In contempt of
court exceeded the authority granted In the
act of 1831 and that the court was without
jurisdiction. Such being the case, the judg
ment ! of the court Is void and therefore a
nullity.
In view of the foregoing the court finds that
the petitioner Is unlawfully restrained of his
liberty and It Is therefore considered and or
dered by the court that the said Josephus
Daniels be discharged from the custody of the
Marshal of the United States and that he go
hence without delay.
ASHEVILLE, N. C, June 29.â Judge
J. C. Pritchard of the United States
Circuit Court to-day filed his opinion in
the celebrated case of Josephus Dan
iels. Daniels, who is editor of the
Raleigh News and Observer, had been
fined $2000 for contempt of court by
District Judge Purnell. / '
Judge Pritchard's opinion will be re
cognized as an authority in regard to
newspaper .utterances that might be
construed as contempt of court.
The text of the decision in part fol
lows: ' ' â¢
The force of public opinion in this country
In favor of the freedom of the press has
rertralned the free Â¦ exercise of the power to
punish this class of contempts and In many
jurisdictions statutes have been enacted de
priving the court of the power to punish them.
It was taken from the Federal courts by act
of Congress of 1831, which act deprives those
courts of the common law power to protect
by this process their suitors, witnesses, officers
and themselves against the libel of th* press,
though published and circulated pending the
trial of a case therein.
Amid the illuminations lighting up
the entire harbor black lines of smoke
indicated that the British vessels had
left their moorings and were slowly
steaming out of the harbor. As the last
cruiser swung Into the line the
illuminations on the Victoria and Al
bert were extinguished. A rocket from
the German flagship signaled "lights
out" and instantly the harbor was in
darkness, as evidence that King Ed
ward's visit had been brought to a
close.
King Edward left the Hohenzollern
at 11:20 p. m., and proceeded to the
Victoria and Albert through a double
line of boats, which were illuminated
by torches.
The most picturesque episode of the
King's visit followed. All the ships in
the harbor had been illuminated with
the exception of the British cruisers,
which were getting up steam prepara
tory to their departure. The night was
perfect and the harbor was bathed in
moonlight. The prevailing quiet was
suddenly broken by the roar of cannon,
which was taken up from ship to ship
all down the harbor in honor of King
Edward's leave-taking. The firing con
tinued until King Edward reached the
Victoria and Albert, and as he stepped
on board a blaze of red fire burst forth
from the royal yacht.
Early this morning Emperor William
went on board the Victoria and Albert
which, escorted by British and. Ger
man torpedo boat dest/oyers, proceeded
to sea to meet the yachts.. The weather
was fine. All the warships and yachts
in the harbor dressed ship in* honor of
the last day of King Edward's visit.
In the racing to-day the course was
from Eckernfoerde northward fifteen
miles and return, thence around the
lightship into Kiel harbor, a total of
fifty-two miles. Prince Henry of Prus
sia sailed the Orion and Crown Prince
Frederick William was on board the
Meteor. The Ingomar led until she had
passed the northern approach of the
course when she fell back as the wind
diminished. The old yachts then piled
on sail, the Suzanne winning the gold
cup.
KIEL. June 29.â King Edward's visit
was brought to an end by a farewell
banquet on the German royal yacht
Hohenzollern to-night. The British
royal yacht Victoria and Albert with
his Majesty on board will sail for Eng
land at daybreak to-morrow escorted
by the British cruiser squadron.
King Edward and Emperor William
to-day witnessed part of the racing
from Eckenfoerde to Kiel on board the
Victoria and Albert. Luncheon wa3
serwd during the race.
The German yacht Suzanne won the
gold cup given by King Edward. The
Empress 1 yacht Iduna was second and
Morton B. Plant's Ingomar was third.
The victory of the Suzanne greatly de
lighted the German yachtsmen. The
Emperor's yacht Meteor III did not
finish" and was towed in by a torpedo
boat. ~

Judge Gilbert's decision granting a prelimi

that no opinion concerning the valuation or the
Contra Costa Water Company's properties ob

Without passing upon the merits of the main
case Judge Gilbert found that there had been
a previous adjudication on the value of the
plant and that this was sufficient for the pur

company has been ordered to give a bond in

Judge Gilbert exonerates the City Council
from the charg<5 that it has been arbitrary in
fixing rates. He also declares that the Council
Is not bound by the action of Its predecessor
in fixing a schedule.
From this decision on preliminary injunction
an appeal cannot be taken, as It Is merely a
temporary matter. In fact, the city should
not want to appeal." but hasten to trial as rap-.

Anburn Loses Prominent Citizen.
The defendants and the inhabitants of the
city can suffer but little Injury in this case
from the enforcement of a temporary restrain
ing order, since all the consumers of water
will be protected by a bond furnished by the
complainant. On the other hand. If the In
junction were refused and It should be finally
determined that the ordinance complained of
does, in fact, establish rates which are con
flscatory and violative of the provisions of the
constitution. It is apparent that the complain
ant would suffer irreparable loss and be sub
jected" to great Inconvenience by reason of Its
Inability to collect Just rates from a consider
able portion of. the consumers of the water.
All the questions Involved In this litigation
ought to bÂ« speedily and finally determined.
No reason is perceived why all the evidence
bearing upon the issues involved may not be
presented within the time permitted ' by the
rule of the court. A preliminary Injunction
will be al'owc-d as prayed for, restraining the
defendants pendente lite, or until the further
order of the court, from enforcing the ordinance
of March 7, 1904. and the complainant will be
required to give a bond irv the sum of $175,000
to answer for all damages which the defend
ants or any person injured by reason of 'Â¦ the
injunction may sustain, if upon the entry of
a final decree herein the said ordinance shall
be sustained. ;..â¢Â¦".;:'Â¦Â¦
It is urged that since the hearing of the
former case the defendants have, at great ex
pense, carefully examined, Investigated and
estimated the values of the properties of the
complainant and have demonstrated by the af
fidavits which they have presented that large
portions of such properties are not actually in
use In furnishing water to the city and county
of San Krancisco, and that a state of facts is
now shown to the court different from that
which was shown on the hearing of the former
case. Without attempting finally to pass upon
the new evidence, or to prejudge its effect when
it shall bo submitted on the final hearing, when
all the matters therein Involved shall be fully
investigated, â¢ â¢ â¢ it Is sufficient, to say
that the showing made at the present time Is
not convincing- that the property so specified
is not In use and Is not necessary to the con
servation of the water supply, the protection
of Its purity and Us delivery to the city, nor
does It convince me that the estimate placed
by the court upen the value of all the prop
erties in the former case was erroneous, or ex
ceeded the Ir actual value.
If, to the estimate of gross earnings fur
nished by the complainant, there be added on
account of Increased population the sum of
$100,000, or $200,000, it is still clear that upon
the flcures submitted the net Income derivable
from the complainant's property would, under
the new ordinance, be less than 4.40 per cent
per annum.
The opinion goes on to say that in
the case of the Spring Valley Water
Works vs. San Francisco, decided a
year ago in the United' States Circuit
Court by Judge Morrow, the total value
of the water plant was fixed at $26,752,
500, and five per cent per annum was
declared to be a just compensation for
the use of the water by the city and its
inhabitants. The opinion proceeds:
Sine* the date of that decision the property
of the complainant Invested In the water
system exceeds that which was shown to be
invested in the former case by $080,767 01* that
its taxes for the coming year will be in e'xeess
of those shown In the fprmer hearing by S1SO -
610; that its operating expenses will exceed
the opt-ratlng expenses of that year by $5+ 000
i^eJiu^ tts J ncom Â« fron > hydrants wlli be
|4S,6. J Â« less than Its Income from the same
source under the ordinance of March 1903
On thÂ«- fate. of thene figures It Is apparent at
a glance that the net income of the complainant
will bÂ« less under the new ordinance than the
4.40 per cent which the court in the former
ca?e adjudged to be less than Just compensa
tion for the public use of the complainant's
property, and to be such a taking of the prop
erty of the complainant for public use In vio
lation of constitutional provisions as would
Justify its temporary .injunction. â¢ â¢ â¢
The opinion reviews the affidavit of
A. Wenzelburger, a public accountant,
who had been engaged in expertlng the
water company's books and who found
the total of tangible properties of the
complainant as shown by its trial bal
ance on December 31, 1903, to be $25,
558,100. The expert found also certain
Items charged to operating expenses
which, in reality, went into part of the
permanent improvements of the com
pany and that the amount so errone
ously charged to operating expenses for
three consecutive years was $217,337 87,
and that other items which should have
no place In operating expenses brought
the aggregate to $236,759 66.
JUDGE MORROW A MODEL.
United States Circuit Judge William
B. Gilbert yesterday handed down a
decision granting the temporary in
junction asked by the Spring Valley
Water Works against the City and
County of San Francisco to restrain
the Board of Supervisors from enforo
ing the water rates ordinance of March
7, 1904. The amount of the general re
duction in rates was shown to be seven
per cent except in the hydrant rate
which was reduced, fifty per cent,
thereby reducing the monthly revenue
from hydrant â¢ service from $3 per
month to $1 per month. Tho water
company alleged that its plant was of
the .value of $50,000,000, and that the
rates as established by the ordinance
would not afford the company a just
or reasonable compensation for Its ser
vices.
Judge Gilbert also granted the tem
porary injunction asked for by the Con
tra Costa Water Company restraining
the Oakland City Council from putting
into force the water rate 'ordinance
adopted by that body for the ensuing
fiscal year. The water company claims
that its plant is of the value of $8,500,-'
000, and that the rates should allow an
income of seven per cent over and
above operating expenses and taxes.
The defendants deny that the plant is
worth more than $4,000,000, and aver
that the rates complained of will allow
six per cent net upon $4,700,000. In the
Contra Costa case Judge Gilbert said:
There â¢ Is nothing: in the facts shown to
Justify tint chargo that In adopting thÂ» reso
lution the Council acted arbitrarily or were
actuated by improper motives, or by any pur
pose save to do what In their Judgment was
right between the complainant and the city
and its inhabitants.
REMARKS OX SPRING VALLEY.
Judge Gilbert, however, did not pass
upon the merits of the case. He re
quired the water company to furnish
a bond of $130,000. The following are
extracts from Judge Gilbert's opinion
in the Spring Valley case:
It appears that the Board of Supervisors
took pains to obtain all the Information avail
able to it, and gave free opportunity to the
complainant to present its evidence' and to
examine the witnesses on whose evidence the
board acted. Nothing iÂ» disclosed In these
proceedings, nor is anything shown in evidence
on this hearing which tends to Indicate that
the board acted otherwise than in good faith,
and with an honest purpose to arrive at a fair
valuation of the complainant's property and
to fix a reasonable rate of compensation for
its water and service.
The next view presented the chapel
cleared of the debris â tons of It; then
cam? the picture of the chapel with the
scaffolding in place and the men at
work rebuilding the walls that the win
ters rains had disintegrated; and lastly
the walls completed, all save a small
bit in the west wall, and thirty feet of
the roof laid. This picture told the
tale! And the league Is proud thereof,
for the walls of San Antonio are once
more rear* d to their wonted height,
and by next San Antonio day the roof
will have been laid that will join them.
The. speaker threw several more in
teresting views upon the screen, show
ing the bronze tablet placed by the
league upon Fort Gunnybags a year
ago; views of the Mission La Purissi
ma, which the league at some remote
day hopes to save from complete ruin:
Colton Hall, the Custom-house and
many structures that are now in proper
har.ds and being saved from destruc
tion, thereby redeeming the name of
our State from the stain of apathy.
The lumber lies without the mission
doors. Where Is he who is willing to
help lift it to root the sacred place
wherein lie the rounders of Western
civilization?
The next picture showed the Interior
of the once beautiful old chapel piled
high with debris, the beams from the
roof lying Upon the graves of the found
ers, the whole grass grown and the
habitat of the lizard and the birds of
the night. .
The business dispatched, Senator
Knowland presented upon a screen the
old mission San Antonio de Padua,
showing it in the days of its prime, its
dusky children wandering through its
corridors, its gardens, fair to gaze, upon,
its tile-roof over the cloister and chapel
unbroken, to the elements. Then came
a picture of ten years later, when lo!
the children have wandered away, the
roof has fallen in. the garden has with
ered, save for the pomegranates and
the roses, and the vandal has wrought
his havoc. Sadness and reproach creep
over one as the conviction comes that
thisâ this pitiful ruinâ need not have
been. And the conviction comes strong
upen tne that in no civilized country
in the world, save our own, would such
despoliation grow unhinderedâ with no
hand raised to stay it.
The election over, a communication
was read 'from James D. Whalen, grand
president of the T. M. I., announcing
the determination of that body to pre
sent a joint entertainment at an early
date to augment the funds of the
league.

BERKELEY, June 29.â All the
trouble over the cutting down of five
elm trees on Center street in violation
of a town ordinance has been settled
and the women of the Town and
Gown Club have called off the dogs
of justice they threatened to put ou
the .trail of the man who plied the
ax. In a signed statement to-day
Lewis A. Hicks of the firm of LJndgren
& Hicks, who was popularly supposed
to be the culprit, explained that it was
all a mistake. Mr. Hicks admits that
there was a technical violation of the
ordinance, but says official permission
had been obtained to carry on tha
work - of removal and everybody
thought he was acting within the let
ter of the law. Mr. Hicks' communi
cation is the result of a meeting with
some of the ladles of the Town and
Gown Club, who accepted h!s expla
nation of the affair and decided to
proceed no further.

OAKLAND, June 29, â Nearly fifty
years ago the sparsely settled district
along the Salt marshes of Mount Eden
was startled und the tongue of gossip
wns net n-going by the disappearance
of four men. One by one they dropped
out of sight, leaving no trace behind
them. All had money; all were going
to take the stage for San Francisco; all
disappeared at ths stage station and
saloon at Mount Eden and none evei
arrived in San Francisco.
â¢One by one the skeleton^ of the miss
inÂ»i men are being dug gut of ground
upon which the old stafte station once
stood, and now. after half a bentttryj
ihu mystery is being cleared away.
The suspicions of the old settlers of
this districts are being confirmed by
the find.: but the ones suspected have
long sin4^ disappeared as completely
as dhl their victims.
The fUst find was made some weeks
ago. It did not attract much attention
until a second skeleton came to light
a few ditya ago. Then investigation was
mud! and the story has come to light.
MITKDKK WllOi OUT.
The murders of early days came out.
as the old saying declares that they
always will, when Henry Crocker, who
owns the Mount Eden store and saloon,
recently started to build a cellar in
which to keep his beer. He turned the
work over to hi? brother-in-law. Wil
liam Gall, who went at it with the aid
of several men.
Two weeks ago the first skeleton was
found, and two days ago another came
to light. They were found within a few
feet of each other, and the position of
the bones showed that the bodies had
b<Â£n burled in small, shallow* holes, evi
dently in haste, and that there was not
the least possibility of " their having
been In regular graves.
Each body was in a sitting posture
with the knees doubled up under the
chin, arid the arms around the head or
the kne*s. Every indication went to
show that the bodies had been doubled
up in the. smallest space possible and
Jamhed down into shallow holes about
two feet square. /The bones were in
gcod preservation and were those of
white men.
Inquiry among the old settlers
brought to light the mysteries of fifty
ytars ago.
A HOUSE OF MYSTERY,
la those day* there was but one
building where now stands the thriv*
Insr settlement of Mount Eden. That
building was used as a stage station.
More and saloon. It stood at the
Junction of the roads from Haj-warda,
Ccnterville, San Lorenso and the salt
marshes. The store and sta^re station
were conducted by a family 'by the
name of Peterman. The saloon was
kept by a woman named Schweea, who
waÂ» the possessor of a husband known
in that district as "Yankee Frtta." He
bore an unsavory reputation as a good
for-nothinsr that eren , to . this day
hangs, iU odored, about Mount Eden.
This couple rented frC.ni ' the" Ptterman
f. vrr.il y and sold refreshment* to tho? e
who stopped on the stages from San
Jose to San Francisco, Rru - to such as
drifted Ma' from tls* surVoundteg sali
marsfces and ranches. There were
many stories around Mount Eden In
those days to the effect that those who j
lmd money and got into this saloon |
never came out with it, but people j
hardly thought the owners would re
sort to murder. t
But one day a man named Cook
started from Mount Eden for San
Francisco on the stage. He had been a
partner with some others In a salt
marsh, and was known to have sold his
interest to his partner for $300. He con
verted clt of his other belongings into
cash, and had. in all. about $1000. With
this he started for San Francisco, but
no one could ever find that he got be
yond the Mount Eden saloon.
OTHERS DISAPPEAR.
It was not customary in those days
to Inquire too closely into the actions
of a man. and if he had no family to
take up a search he might disappear
without attracting much attention.
But the time came when another man
was lost to sight^and he, too, could
not be traced beyond the Mount Eden
saloon and stage house. The name of
the second man was King, and he was
a partner of Barron, the owner of Bar
ron's landing, on Mount Eden Slough.
He, too, became tired of life at Mount
Eden, sold out. and started for San
Francisco. He also stopped at the
Mount Eden saloon while waiting for
the stage, and no one could ever find
that he got beyond that place.
The people of that section began to
wag their heads and whisper that all
was not right at the roadside house.
But men were free in those days and
It did not get beyond the whispered
story, for there was a fear of a burned
barn in the night or stampeded cattle
or damages to property or even life,
fcr In the ways of darkness "Yankee
FritÂ«" was known to be an adept.
Then one William Robertson went 1
the way of the others, and after hln:
George Bain. Of thes* two men but
little is known. The/other two were
better known and their connection with
the development of the early salt in
terests of that section has been car
ried down more than fifty years. But
to-day all that can be found in Mount
Eden' about Robertson and Bain are
their names connected with the famous \
mystery of the early days of the little ;
hamlet. ?*^
FOUR ARE LOST.
By the Ura4 four men had dropped
out of sight feeling becarcr so strong
against the IH-sarored couple that one
day they sold their place and went to
San Francisco. It was jrood news to
Mount Eden and the people were glad
they had gone. Mount Eden was satis
fied with their 'deoartare to drop but
not forget the story that hung over
their place. * It was said that the coup!e
came to Mount Eden without a dollar
and that they took with them thou>
sands, but how this came to be known
the Mount Edenitts cf the present day
are unable to say. The Petermaa
family ateo left asd nothing has beÂ«n
heard of any of them since.
When the railroad was built from
San Jose to Oakland the old stag? lins
and it* station were abandoned, * The
building, was old and of .little, value
and when MoUht Â£&?n bfreaxae "a larger
settleraesst the old place was torn down.
OAKLAND, June 29. â After a hear
ing lasting two days Judge W. E.
Greene this afternoon approved the
accounting of Helen A. Dunning and
Annie A. Barton as trustees of th*
estate of W. A. Aldrich, deceased. He.
however, cut down the allowance of
the trustees from $750 each, as aiked
for. to $500 each, and the fees of At
torney Leicester from $600 to $500.
This is the annual accounting of thÂ«
trustees of the estate, which Is valued
at J232.846. George A. Aldrich. who
was once adjudged incompetent by the
court, appeared at the hearing to-day
and made a long series of objections
to the proceedings of the trustees.
OAKLAND. June 29. â Accidental
death from extensive burns was the
verdict rendered by a Coroner's jury
to-night jn the case of Mrs. Hairy D.
Danforth. who was f fatally burned
yesterday noon at her residence, 1257
Filbert street, , by ignited coal oil.
Testimony of Charles G. Reed, Mrs.
Danfonh's father: Mrs. Katherine
F. Haw trey, the housekeeper; E. A.
Collins and Charles Valpey, express
men, who broke into the room where
Mrs. Danforth'9 body lay, was taken.
Collins said he found the body close
to the room door. It appeared as if
Mrs. Danforth had tried to make her
way out of the room after her gar
ments were set afire, but had been
overcome by the smoke and the
shock. None- of the witnesses could

Promise Their Support
to Across thW Bay
HELP OAKLAND
TO CELEBRATE
The Republican Committee of the
Third Congressional District held a
meeting in this city to-day, but did
nothing toward the appointment of
delegates from the outside districts.
This action will be left for the meet'ng
to be held Friday, fwhen all the com
mitte'emen will be expected to hand In
their list of names. The only business
transacted to-day wds the adoption of
the legal calls and notices of primar
ies and convention as, required by the
new election laws.
The indications are that there will
be very little friction in the Republican
party upon this side of the bay over
any of the nominations to be made this
year. Whatever opposition there was
to J. R. Knowland for the Republican
nomination for Congress has dropped
and it looks now as if his nomination
would be made unanimous.
There was a conference in Alameda
last night over the question of a suc
cessor to Mr. Knowland' as State Sen
ator. It was decided that City Attor
ney W. M. Simpson should be given
the general support for that place and
that J. Clem Bates, present Assembly
man from Alameda, should again be
returned. R. B. Tappan has announced
himself as a candidate for State Sen
ator, but It is not believed that he will
enforce it. Alameda County has three
State Senators to elect this year. As
semblyman J. G. Mattos Jr. has no op
position in the new Thirteenth Dis
trict; \V. M. Simpson will probably go
from the Fourteenth, serving out the
unexpired term of J. R. Knowland, and
G. R. Lukens has no opposition as a.
successor to himself in the Fifteenth
District, while F. "W. Leavitt js a hold
over in the Sixteenth District.
â¢ There are some uncertainties in the
Assembly fights. J. Clem Bates in the
Forty-seventh and W. H. Waste In the
Fifty-second District are about the only
certainties, though the incumbents In
the other districts are all candidates
for re-election and naturally have a
little the best of the contests, if con
te*ts there are.
County Assessor Dalton denies that
he will run for Congress against Mr.
Knowland. - . " *

DJRY. GOODS CLERK IS
\- ACCUSED OP FORGERY
Theodore Frank, pursued by his
7. t,ung wife Alf reida and his mother-iu
law. Mrs. August Holland, of 459 Geary
street, rushed into the Central Police
Ptation yesterday morning carrying
his two-year-old son. in his arms.
He complained to Sergeant Moffitt
that his %vife and mother-in-law were
to leave yesterday morning for St.
J_ouis, taking the boy with them. He
had gone to his mother-in-law's rooms
at 459 Geary street, where his wife was
living, and had taken possession of the
boy.
Mrs. Frank and Mrs. Holland as
sured the sergeant that they were sim-
I>!y going to St. Louis on a visit and In
ttnded to return, after which a suit for
divorce would be instituted and the
custody of the child determined. The
sergeant told them that he could not
Interfere as the father had a right to
have possession of his child.
Mrs. Frank demanded the return of
the child, but Frank refused to part j
with him, and the mother-in-law in-'
Fisted that he should go to Attorney
I>ouderback's office- and have the ques
tion of possession settled.
"This woman." said Frank, pointing
to his mother-in-law, "has been the
cause of all our troubles. I was mar
ried to her daughter more than three
years ago. At that time I was a florist
on Telegraph avenue, Oakland, and for
a few months we lived happily to
gether. Then came the mother-in-law
and discord. Two weeks before the
child's birth she compelled my wife to
]*ave my home and we have not lived
together since. She has threatened
that she would not die " till she had
wrecked me and had seen me behind
the bars of San Quentin. I sold out my
business about two years ago and have
made every effort to get my wife to re
turn to me but all in vain."
Mrs. Holland denied that she had
d<<r:e anything Â¦wrong. She accused
Prank of neglecting to support his wife
property and said that was why she
had advisod her daughter to live with
her.
Jiy th" time thoy had finished their
explanations the train for the East had
o^part^d and they left the station with
the intention of going to Attorney
!x>ud?rback*s office.' Frank retained

Another Russian warship has gone to the bottom and
another Japanese victory has been added to the credit
of the fighting sailors of the Mikado. If for no ether
reason than to relieve the monotony of this sort of thing
to a patient reading world our Russian friends should
make a desperate effort to record at least one lonely
triumph on sea or land.
What seems mostly to have im
pressed the negro Alake, or King of
Abeokuta, In the western part of
Africa, on the occasion of his recep
tion the other day, by King Edward
was the gorgeousness of the gold laced
liveries and knee breeches of the royal
fcotman, and on taking his departure
he explained that while he himself
was going to wear In future on state
occasions a uniform exactly similar to
that of King Edward, he intends to
dress his retainers In liveries "Just like
the King's family at Buckingham
Palace."
This dusky King has been one of the
successes of the London season, driv
ing about in royal carriages and tre
mendously cheered by the public when
ever they caught a glimpse of his gor
geous apparel.
What Clothes Mean.
PUBLIC SPEAKING â Subscriber.
City. WhÂ»n a person at a banquet or
meeting Is called upon to respond to
a toast or say something for the good
of the cause such person should re
spond and not try to avoid making an
answer by saying "Excuse me, but I'm
no speaker." While it Is not probable
that every citizen of the United State*
can attain the standard of Daniel
Webster, Henry Clay or J. C. Calhoun.
it is both proper and expedient that
ail, whatever may be the vocation or
position In life, should occasion re
quire, be able to acquit themselves
creditably in a public utterance of a
formal character.
Let us be thankful for the news in a recent dispatch
from Italy that the last of the brigands that made the
lives of the traveling public uncomfortable and thepen
insula picturesque is dead and with his unworthy fath
ers. We may find now some relief from the impossible
comic operas in which these old rascals have figured so
ingloriously and unmelodiously.
CLASS PERIODICALSâ M. S. P..
City. The monthly periodical called
Good Government and another called
Municipal Journal and Engineering,
both published In New York, devote
much space to municipalities and mu
nicipal works. Poor's Railroad Manual
and the Railroad Gazetteer of New
York are authorities on railroads.
Maximite differs from dynamite, lyd
dite, nitroglycerine, guncotton and
other highly explosive compounds in
that It is less easily exploded, and,
therefore, much safer to handle and
carry aboard a war vessel. It is also
more deadly in Its work, for a shell
loaded with it does not explode until
after it has penetrated or become im
bedded in the object at which it was
aimed. By very thorough tests at
Sandy Hook, the United States Govern
ment testing and proving ground, max
imite has excelled everything thus far
discovered. as a powerful explosive for
projectiles. In every detail It met the
requirements of the Governmentâ for it
had very high explosive power and did
not lose this force by being kept a long
time; yet it could be safely handled, as
it would not explode from any shock
except that of the cap made especially
for that purpose. Moreover, the shell
loaded with maximite could be safely
fired from big guns at high velocity
and would withstand the far greater
shock of piercing the heaviest armor
plate before exploding.â St. Nicholas
Maxim it e.

he saw a woman in a lot who was
having a bad time with a sick cow.
The animal had eaten too much green
alfalfa and had a severe case of colic.
The woman was afraid the cow would
die, and none of the neighbors who
had gathered about knew what to do.
"I can fix that all right," exclaimed
Melick, as .Joon as he grasped the sit
uation. His air of confidence made an
impression on the owner of the cow,
who consented that he should try his
hand as veterinarian.
"Go and get me a bucket of salt
and a rope," said the would-be Assem
blyman, and in a few minutes they
were brought to hjm.
He then forced s open the cow's
mouth, and, putting the rope in to
keep it open, he tied the ends around
her horns. Next he took a handful
of salt and threw it on the cow's
tongue. A cow does not like salt in
such quantities and this one began
gagging and trying to free herself of
the unwelcome mouthful. Her strug
gles in so doing had the effect of re
lieving the animal's pain, and then
Melick opened the yard gate and
led her up and down the road in
order that the activity of movement
might help on the process of cure. A
few turns up and down the road and a
few more handfuls of salt worked
wonders and before long the cow was
restored to her owner as well as ever.
During the time all this had been
going on a crowd had collected and
Melick had a better audience than he
had had in the masa-meeting and a
good deal more enthusiastic one, so
that his â¢ good deed in curing the
widow's cow did not lack advertise
ment.
When the returns of that precinct
came in it was found that Melick led
the ticket by twenty votes.
THE 'findings of the last census as tb illiteracy are
interesting. The total number of persons in the
United States Â¦ of 10 years' and over unable to read
or write was -6,180,000, of whom 3,200,000 were whites,
the negroes supplying 2,980,000. While the percentage
of negro illiterates to the whole negro population is
large, still, all thing* -. nsidcred, the showing is rather
nattering to that race.
Among the whites it is evident that most of the illit
erates are foreign immigrants, but how can one account
for the fact that in the State of New York there are
47,000 native born illiterates? With our public schools
in operation it seems impossible that any native born
American should be unable to read and write. New
York has a population of 7,268,012. The native illiter
ates are a small percentage, but why should there be
any?
In. 1899 our population of school age was 21,830,774;
the enrollment in. the public schools was 15.13S.715. and
the average daily attendance was 10,389,407. From
this it appears that only half the school population was in
attendance, and about five millions of the enrollment did
not attend. Our total expenditure on the public school's
was $197,281,603, of which $128,662,880 was for the sala
ries of teachers. It would seem that such an expenditure
should secure better results in the average attendance,
ana that there should be no native illiterates. The cen
sus dissections are not at hand to enable the location of
the native illiterates. When they are furnished it will
illuminate the subject by tracing the 'items of expendi
ture, population of school age, enrollment and average
attendance, to see what relation they bear to the location
of illiteracy.
California stands very well in the list of States, having
253.397 enrolled in the public schools, with an average
daily attendance of 203,248, and 8157 teachers. That is a
small army of teachers, but the proportion of teachers
to pupils in attendance is not large enough. It implies
too many pupils per teacher to get the best results. If
we are to educate in the public schools, it should not be
at this expense of the health and strength and sacrifice
of the teachers, but at the expense of the State. If a
teacher have twenty more pupils than should be allotted
to one instructor, they are being educated at the expense
of the teacher, who is caring for twenty more than the
State pays for. Over 8000 teachers are contributing
more in that way to public education than any similar
number of average taxpayers.

The St. Louis Exposition has had its first experience
with fire, and by the kindness of the fates has escaped
without serious harm. As might have been expected, the
conflagration started on the "Pike." If reports from
the exposition city even measurably reflect the truth,
the "Pike" must be about the warmest spot on the Amer
ican continent to-day.

help get him "off the island." There

a man to come here and engage In a
questionable occupation without being

New York may be lenient with some
nuisances, but the city beggars have
certainly been subdued. It took years
and years of wrestling with the ques
tion before this shiftless, good-for

any manner of subjugation, but beg

severe punishment. Of course, there
is still a tremendous amount of beg

California producers stood ready to show the thousands
at St. Louis just 1 what their State can bring forth from
its fertile soil. That the -eye might not be the only

evidence of our wealth of vine and f-ee in the form of
fresh fruits distributed with lavish hand and claret punch

Californians have every reason to feel pride in the

of pamphlets, reports of trade boards and commercial
bodies, county bulletins and private cahiers, all of
which have gone to enlighten the world at large upon

Yerkes tube and tramway interests in
the metropolis have now assumed such
colossal proportions that the erstwhile
Chicago magnate wishes to â have an
other representative there who can be
trusted to keep a friendly eye on hi_
schemes.
This has excited Mr, John Sharp Williams, who ex
hausts hi3 stock of invective in calling it "unsafe, in
sane, reckless and incredible." But why is it either)
Now, and for an indefinite future, the international is
sues of the greatest interest of this country are tb bt
found, in Latin-America. In order to clearly compre
hend them and our duty and relation to them, it is
necessary to know the conditions in the sixteen inde
'perident states of that. part of our hemisphere. Â¦ Thej
are nominally republics and as such command the senti
mental sympathy of our people; but, unhappily, in near
ly all of them government is republican in form only,
while absolute in substance. â¢*
Administration is unstable, subject to revolutionary
change, and violent- transfer from one usurping dictator
to another. Their judicial processes partake of the
willful character of their executive administration, which
is usually defiant of the rights of person and property.
Under such circumstances the ownership of property
has fallen to the few who are strong enough to defend
it against their predatory government, and the masses
are without property or enterprise. Most of those
states are rich in natural resources, but their develop
ment by their own citizens means the placing of wealth
within the lawless reach of irresponsible government,
and so they remain unexploited, except by the energy
and capital of the nationals of the United States and
Europe.
These conditions are not new. They existed when
Edward Everett as Secretary of State made the treaty of
1851 with Peru to secure the rights of our citizens in
the development of that country by the navigation of
its waters and freedom of its seaports, and when Secre
tary Marcy contended for similar privileges on the
Amazon, declaring them to be a necessary means for the
development of its watershed. They, like their prede
cessors and successors, at the head of our Foreign Of
fice, contended for the security of private intercouse be
tween, nations as essential to commerce and to the spread
and growth of civilization.
The conditions oÂ»' executive instability and judicial
wantonness which existed in their day have increased,
and the need of foreign enterprise and capital has in
tensified throughout Latin-America until it- is esti
mated that over one billion of dollars of capital belong
ing to North Americans and Europeans is invested be
tween the Rio Grande and the Straits of Magellan. The
activities and institutions incident to the social state and
national life are founded upon that capital. Mining,
transportation, manufactures, banking, insurance and the
factoring of the products of the soil are all dependent
upon it.
The usurping dictators, who grasp executive power to
misuse and finally surrender it to other revolutionary
usurpers, having impoverished their own people, look
lustfully upon the property of the foreigner. It is a
tempting spoil. Though usurpers they are the wards of
our Monroe doctrine, which protects the integrity of
their soil and sovereignty, and which we will never sur
render, for it is as necessary to our national safety as
the constitution itself. Its nature and function are mis
construed by them to shelter their violation of all inter-
I national obligations. Such violation is an act of war,
but the finality of war is the loss of soil and sovereignty,'
and they are the first group of states in the world to
have both made forever inalienable by the hegemony of
a power like the United States.
Therefore, it is that we must look to Latin-America,
to sixteen independent states, a majority of them under
irregular government, in chronic revolution, impoverish
ing \heir own people by robbery, and existing at all by
foreign investment of capital, for the source of our seri
ous complications with Europe, and the only part of the
world, where our own nationals are recklessly robbed,
humiliated and oppressed. We have just passed through
the first experience in the Venezuelan incident, and in
the use recklessly made of it in our domestic politics
we may measure the consequences latent in the Latin-
American situation.
To our people is due a sane and frank discussion of
that admonitory event. The ways and means of spolia
tion of the nationals of Europe and the United States in
Latin-America are numerous and ingenious. The issue
has been presented to our people as the collection of
ordinary debts .by war, and, an impeachment of our ad
ministration is attempted for permitting the concerted
powers to blockade the ports of Venezuela in such an
enterprise.
An ordinary debt is one that arises in every day busi
ness, in the exchange of commodities or the use of
credit. A defaulting debtor may be judicially pursued
for collection, and if judgment and execution follow, ac
cording to the principles of either the common or the
civiMaw, the creditor, if domiciled abroad, has no cause
to apply to the state of which he is a national for re- I
dress by diplomatic act-intefvention. If his debtor
have property to respond to execution the finality is
satisfactory. If not, he must stand the loss as he would
at home.
How then can an ordinary debt, due in Latin-America
to the national of a foreign state, become properly the
subject of diplomatic .intervention? The answer to this
is important, for it is in that the critics find the opportu
nity to ground a complaint against their own country,
and even to demand that it abandon our own citizens
their persons and their property, to the criminal cupid
ity of the amorphous governments ; which disfigure
much of Latin-America. Â¦
When the courts palpably deny justice to the foreign
creditor, or executive power interferes to prevent the
execution of the judgment, a case for diplomatic inter
vention is created.
Secretary William L. Marcy, explaining that our-citi
zens offending against the laws of another country must
submit to their penalty, said:
"This principle does not at all interfere with the right
of any state to protect its citizens abroad from wrongs
and injuries, from arbitrary acts of oppression or de
privation of property as contradistinguished from penal
ties and punishments." V.' "
If we take any other position than that stated by the

Commissioner North declined to
state what were the recommendations
in his report mailed yesterday to the
Department of Commerce and Labor
at Washington. Ine company was
represented by the law firm of Strat

presented that the clerks, being reg

college, should be considered as pro

ban of the contract labor provisions
ci o the immigration laws. United
States District Attorney Marshall B.
Woodworth was served with a copy
of the report and he said yesterday
that he could not take any action in

Mayor Schmitz yesterday signed the
municipal budget covering the expendi
tures of the next fiscal year as adopted
last Friday by the Board of Super
visors. The charter requires that the
Mayor sign the ordinance designating
the budget appropriations before it can
become a law. The document was for
warded to the Mayor, who is now at
the Yosemite, and it was then returned
by him. The only veto not sustained
by the Board of Supervisors was that
cutting down the appropriation for ex
penses of litigation in the Spring Val
ley Water Company's suit from $25,000
to $10,000. The other vetoes of $5000 for
maintenance of minors in non-sectar
ian institutions and $1475 for the pay
ment of premiums on bonds of certain
city officials were withdrawn by the
Mayor, who sent a telegram to that ef
fect from the Yosemite, but the vetoes
were formally overruled by the Super
visors so there could be no technicality
in the matter.

"Whether or not contractors can per
form street work under a permit which
has lapsed was the subject of discus
sion by the Board of Works at its
meeting held yesterday. The matter
came up when some property owners
appeared before the board to urge a
delay of six months in the proceedings
for the paving of Church street, be
tween Twenty-third and Twenty-ninth.
They stated that the City Street Im
provement Company was engaged jn
getting signatures for the doing of the
work under private contract. Flinn &
Treacy objected to the delay, claiming
to have secured a permit for the work
on two blocks one year ago. The per
mit, however, had lapsed and Attor
ney J. B. Gartland advised the board
that proceedings could not be inaugu
rated under the permit. Tie board
rather took this view of the matter but
postponed formal action for one week.
The board appointed J. Boxton and
J. Rebstock inspectors of street clean
ing at $4 per day.
The petition of the Knights Templar
for permission to erect grand stands on
Van Ness avenue at Fell, Hayes, Cut

C. J. Coyle appeared before the board
and urged that the granite around the
City Hall be cleaned by day's labor In
stead of by machinery. The matter
was referred to Commissioner Maes
tretti for investigation as to the results
of both methods.

Many and varied have been the
amendments proposed for the curing
of defects in the city's charter, but the
one which Supervisor Braunhart will
shortly submit to the Board of Super
visors will no doubt meet with the
approval of the taxpayers. Braun
hart's amendment is designed to modi
fy the dollar limit of taxation, as pro
vided in article 3, chapter 1, section
II of the charter, relating to the mak
ing of the tax levy on the last Monday
in June, so that ninety "cents of the
levy will be applied to the payment of
all demands for the current expendi
tures of the city government and the
remaining ten cents will be specifically
designated for the carrying out of pub
lic improvements.
The fact that the assessment
roll for this year will aggre
gate a sum greater than $515,
000,000 has Impelled Braunhart to
submit his amendment. In all likeli
hood the roll will be increased next
year to an amount in excess of that re
turned this year and this makes it
apparent that the city will have
abundant funds to pay all expenses
and also to make large improvements
with a dollar tax. Of course the seven
cents allowed outside of the dollar limit
for the maintenance of parks as fixed
by the charter will continue in opera
tion.
The tax of ten cents for improve
ments would next year produce a sum
in excess of $500,000. This would be in
dependent of any other improvements
that could be inaugurated by the Su
pervisors under its tax rate of ninety
cents. The rate adopted for the next
fiscal year was $1 12 on every 5100 of
assessed valuation, of which 7 cents
is for parks, 12.54 cents for redemption
of bonds and interest thereon and 92.46
cents for running expenses. Out of
this last rate the board found it pos
sible to set aside the sum of $450,000 for
big public improvements, such as the
widening of Fourth street, the paving
of H street, the opening of Fulton
street, the partial construction of a
salt water system and other projects.
Add to this the sum of $500,000 de
signed to be raised by a specific tax of
ten cents within the dollar limit and
there is a total of nearly $1,000,000 for
alone.
With such a sum it would be pos
sible, if the assessment roll warrants
it, to levy the tax for bonds inside of
the dollar limit instead of outside as
is done at present under the charter.
Braunhart's amendment will provide
for this alternative course when the
funds are adequate for the purpose.
The amendment will in all likelihood
be submitted to the people at the end
of- the year so that it may be ratified
by the next Legislature and become
operative during the fiscal year 1905
1906.

WILLIAM K VANDERBILT JR. TROPHY. "WHICH WILL BE CONTESTED FOR
IN OCTOBER OVER LONG. ISLAND ROADS FOR THE FIRST TIME BY THE
REPRESENTATIVE MOTORISTS OF THIS CQUNTRY AND EUROPE
William K. Vanderbilt Jr. has offered
a valuable trophy for a long distance
automobile race which is expected to
develop into a sensational international
contest.
The first race will be run on October
8 of this year over a course on Long
Island. The race will be held over a
course of not less than two hundred
and fifty miles nor more than threa
hundred miles. It will be open to the
motorists of the world, but it is speci
fied that not more than ten men from
one country will be allowed to com
pete.
The race must be held in America
during 1904 and 1905. Subsequent to
1905 it may be held In the country in
which the cup is held. It is expected
that having the race in America the
first two years will give marked impe
tus to the sport of long distance racing.
The race must always be run on the
public highways and never on the
track. France will probably send her
most daring operators to compete in
the first race. American manufac
turers were unprepared to start ma
chines in the recent international con
test for the James Gordon Bennett cup,
but they will be strongly represented in
the Vanderbilt cup race.

As Hopper has just returned from
the East, where he had a chance to
observe the way the game is played
there, with all its up to date accessor
ies, he will be invaluable to the Cali
fornia eleven. "While in New York he
had an opportunity to study the game
closely, so that he is in touch with the
latest style of play.
Hopper is one of the idols of Cali
fornia football history. During his col
lege career he played football every
year. He did not make the varsity
eleven until '99, when he was quarter
back of the famous team that beat
Stanford SO to 0. In 1900 Hopper coach
ed the eleven of the University of Ne
vada that defeated Stanford that year
and in 1901 assisted Dr. Frank Simp
son in coaching the California varsity
eleven.
James Hopper has accepted the in
vitation of the executive committee of
the Associated Students to act as head
coach this year for the football eleven
of the University of California. The
final arrangements were made yester
day when Hopper met Colonel George
C. Edwards, Graduate Manager Ezra
Decoto, Football Captain Ben K.
Stroud and James K. Moffltt of the
executive committee and discussed
terms that were accepted by the ath
letic diplomats.
The consent of Hopper to coach the
team was not obtained without a good
deal of persuading. Hopper had his
heart set on returning at once to the
Philippines, there to gather material
for magazine stories. Such flattering
inducements were held out to him by
the committee that he decided at last
to forego the trip until after the big
intercollegiate game in November. Just
what kind cf an offer decided Hopper
to yield Is withheld by the parties to
the transaction, but it is understood
to be quite substantial.
Hopper was hit upon as the man for
the place after Harry Hudson of last
year's eleven had declined the offer of
the committee. Hudson holds a posi
tion with the Southern Pacific Com
pany at Bakersfleld and was disin
clined to give up the opportunities that
go with such a place to figure in the
short-lived glories of the footAall field.

In the toss for position late this after

NEW LONDON. Conn., June 29.â
The annual regatta of Harvard and
Yale oarsmen will be rowed over the
Thames River course to-morrow. Fair
weather and smooth water are ex
pected. During the early hours of to
night practically no bets of importance
were made. The prevailing odds were
on Yale at 2 to 1. At one of the hotels
a slate of results that seemed to have
some supporters had it that the four
oared race would surely go to Har
vard; that there was every prospect
of a fairly stiff fight' between freshman
eights, with probabilities in favor of
Harvard, and that the Yale varsity
eight would win the big race. However
good this forecast may prove to be, it
was remarked that, the reports from
up-river, were strikingly alike to the
effect that the two big crews are prob
ablyTthe best that ever represented the
two universities.'

UXCLE'S 3IEX SHCT OUT.
PORTLAND, June 29. â When Port
land scored in the seventh inning the
baseball fans went wild with delight.
Jot the wise ones saw with prophetic
eyes the game won by the home team.
Nor was their faith in vain. Ike
Butler, with perfect support back of
him, shut out the San Francisco men.
The final score was 1 to 0.*
It Tras one of the prettiest pitchers*
battles of the season. Butler's delivery
â¢was above criticism, while Phil Knell,
for the men from the south, pitched
a brilliant game. The bunching of
hits by the Browns in the seventh won
the game. In this inning Drennan sin
gled and was sacrificed to second by
Beck. He went to third on Raymond's
out and scored when Irwin failed to
*=coop Castro's infield hit. Ike Fran
cis played short and Raymond third.

TACOMA, June 29. â After having
the game won to-day the Tigers al
most lost in the last two Innings.
While at bat in the seventh St. Vrain,
who had pitched shut out ball, had
to retire, being hit on his throwing
arm by a pitched ball. Toman sin
gled and Flood tripled off Thomas,
who was then replaced by Keefe. The
latter was not warmed up and on
Â¦Wheeler's single a second run came
In. Although Chase doubled after this
no further damage was done.
In the last inning Egan went out at
first and Newton, who batted for
Gray, fanned. * Toman hit safely for
a base and Flood scored him with a
double. Flood tallied on Smith's sin
gle. Wheeler was unable to get the
ball out of the diamond and the An
gels failed to tie the score. St. Vrain
may be out of the game for some
time. Shechan and Nor^yke did some
splendid fielding. Gray was in good
form, but his battery errors coupled
with timely hits gave the Tigers their
runs. Score:

this afternoon from Oakland. With
the score a tie In the sixth Inning and
one man on base, Smith drove the ball ;
almost to the rlghtfleld fence for a
home run. It was the longest bit ever
made In Seattle and Smith reached the
plate elx feet ahead of the ball, which
was fielded perfectly by Ganley and
Schlafley.
The Oakland men started as if they
intended to make mincemeat of Charley
Hall, but the farther the game went
the stronger the youngster pitched.
Opposed to him was Buchanan. With i
three men on bases and none out In the
eighth. Hall retired the side on Infield

SHEEPSHEAD BAY, June 29. â The
Cricket; was much the best horse" in the
first race to-day, defeating South
Trimble by two lengths. The unavail
ing: effort of Hurst Park to snoulder
129 pounds and concede thirty-four
pounds to the three-year-old colt,
Spring, in the second race was the
theme of conversation among observing
turfmen. On the track, which was still
damp and somewhat heavy. Hurst
Park was beaten a little over a length
by his younger opponent, Spring, which,
in the opinion of many, must have been
overlooked by the handicapper.
BT R. Thomas' St. Bellane won the
Pansy selling stakes, although Merry
Lark, the second horse, was an 8 to 5
favorite.
Ort Wells carried the high impost of
130 pounds easily to the front in the
fourth race. He had little opposition,
Mercury being the best of the three
which" opposed him. Ort Wells 'again
showed he is much improved over his
form of five weeks ago.
"More reversals," said one of the
best-known bookmakers at the close of
the fifth race, which was won by, Agile,
with the 7 to 10 favorite. The Claimant,
in fourth place.

, Q. Rednark, agent for Wells-Fargo at
; Toano, Nev., testified that E. % S. Sproat
came there and wanted to get a rig to'
take him to his brother's ranch. He
had a dress suit case with him. On
his return from his brother's ranch he
opened the suit .-.ease? in the presence
of. Rednark and took out two cigar
boxes, each containing $1700. which
he shipped to himself at Los Angeles.
There were two other cigar boxes in
the suit case. Clyde Rippey, a livery
man at Los Angeles, told of E. S.
Sproat hiring a rig from him to go to
San "Diego. They picked up Sproat's
sister and a boy and later Sproat's
mother and his brother Sam joined
them. Each of the Sproats had suit
cases and there was a lot of baggage.
Rippey's instructions were to avoid all
the main streets and frequented roads.
When nearing San Diego the Sproats
were arrested. s Â§
Miles. McClennan Robinson, who
looked as if he had just stepped out
of the cast of one of Denman Thomp
son's rural character dramas, told
Judge Fritz how he lost $225 and why
He suspected Annie Brown, middle
aged and buxom, of having stolen.lt.
He came down from his farm near
Stockton to have a good time in the
city while his money lasted, but it
didn't last long.
- In accordance with the traditional
custom of .the agriculturist just ar
rived, Mr. Robinson hastened to the
nearest .bootblack stand and had his
footgear polished. So pleased was he
with the work of the brush wlelder
that he Jproppsed a drink and it was
in Â¦ the Pacific-street saloon to which
they adjourned that he saw and was
Instantly smitten by the charms of
Miss Brown. She condescended to
drink with him and in a short time he
had spent $5 and all his loose change
wa^ gone. Then he plunged a hand
Into the rear pantaloons pocket in
which, he had deposited a purse con
taining $225 in. gold, and to his dis
may found nothing.
"I accused- .this here wdman of hav
in* took th' money," Mr. Robinson
testified, "and she said she had it and
intended to keep it, because she could
take better care of it than I could.
She said she was afraid I might get
into bad company and be robbed."
Instead of feeling flattered by the
solicitude thus displayed, Mr. Robin
son went outside and told his trouble
to a policeman. "Then," he contin
ued, "another policeman drove up in
a bus and gave us a ride."
Miss Brown stoutly denied having
taken or even having seen Mr. Rob
inson's pnrse. The hearing will be re
sumed to-day.

James Fitzpatrick and Joseph Stone
stole a bolt of calico from a Stockton
street clothing store last Monday and
so easily did they get away with the
goods that the following day they re
turned to steal another * bolt â and
were caught in the act. They will be
sentenced to-day for petty larceny.
Roma White pleaded guilty to a
.charge of selling liquor without a li
cense at 2808 Greenwich street and
declared his intention of getting out
of the wet goods trade Immediately.
Then he was fined $40 by Judge Mo
gan.

M. S. Cook, the Los Angeles blood.
who spent three consecutive days and
nights in hired automobiles and tried
to dodge payment of the $525 indebt
edness thus incurred, effected a set
tlement on a 50 per cent basis with
the chauffeurs, who had him arrested,
and the charge against him was dis
missed.
So copious was the flow of tears
from Louis Swanson's eyes that his
gray. beard was dripping as he stood
before Judge Mogan and heard him
self accused of having had lottery
tickets in his possession. He blub
bered and bawled and Wrung his
hands when the policeman produced
the tickets in evidence and he fairly
shrieked his terror when Judge Mo
gan remarked that the case for the
prosecution seemed to be clear.
"Shut up!" commanded Bailiff
Hickey, Shaking the defendant'3
shoulders.
""What are you weeping for?" asked
the Judge.
"For my family in Wisconsin," was
the sobby answer. "When they hear
of this awful disgrace that has be
fallen me $hey'll die of shame."
The ear-splitting wail that followed
the explanation was plainly heard
down in the Chief's office and prompt
ed sarcastic inquiry as to whether
some other poor prisoner was being
abused.
"Take him away â the case is dis
missed!" shouted the Judge.
"Get out quÂ»ck!" said Hickey.
With saturated handkerchief press
ed to his mouth the emotional actor
from Wisconsin made a hasty exit.

Eugene Goodwin, . director of the
Commercial Museum, has Just received
inquiries from far away Bolivia for
dairy machinery, machinery for the
manufacture of vermicelli, for . oil
engines, i'.our. furniture and leather.
The importers, so says Mr.
Goodwin, have b'een buying in
France and Germany, but write that
they desire to give the United States
exporters and manufacturers art oppor
tunity. This is considered to be an op
portune time, in view of this inquiry,
to try to open up relations from this
port to Bolivia.
It is also reported that inquiries for
book and news paper, clothing, woolen
shirts and blankets, cotton yarns and
l<Â«ather in large quantities have been
received from Japan. New Zealand has
inquired about wines. Manila importers
are asking about clothing, haberdash
ery, underwear, hats and other articles..
A large English house seeks to procure
barrels to be used in the exportation of
Chinese oils from Shanghai.
Inquiry for goods that can be advan
tageously exported from San Francisco
Is livelier than at any time in recent
years. This is largely, attributed by
merchants to the efforts of the Pacific
Commercial Museum, which, some
months ago, sent to the countries-bor
dering on the Pacific Ocean a publica
tion in. which all the facts about San
Francisco's trade facilities were duly
set forth, together with a list of ex
porters of San Francisco and much
other information of the same sort.

Some . sensational testimony was
given at* the trial before a jury in
Judge Fritz's court of E. S. Sproat,
charged with defrauding his creditors.
J. D. Harrington, who was employed
as a clerk In the Saratoga MarkeCtes
tifled that for'several days prior to De
cember ' 2 9, when trie Sproats left the
city, they kept their coin in . cigar
boxes, and the day before their dis
appearance they carried out five sacks,
each), containing more than $2500, I*
John Grey (colored) came over from
Oakland, where he is employed as a
head waiter, to book cakewalking
talent for the terpslchorean function
which Is to wind up the Fourth
of.' July celebration arranged by
the select set of Alameda County's
Afro^Amerlcan society. While scour
ing Pacific street in search of ,the best
artists that money could procure he
collided with Joseph Larnleu, a French
gentleman, who went down and took
the count, while Mr. Grey ran, but was
soon overtaken and arrested. He had
a swollen Jaw when he faced Judge
Mogan and explained that it was
caused by a ulcerated tooth, which, he
feared, would Incapacitate " him from
participation In the coming patriotic
festival, even If the Judge should dis
miss the charge of battery against him.
As there was no appearance * for the
prosecution, as the ulcerated tooth was
undoubtedly raging, and as Mr. Grey's
detention In custody might play havoc
with tho arrangements for the cake
walk afore mentioned, dismissal of the
case was ordered.
Y. "W. Casteel, a young man 'from
Tennessee, who shot R.L. Durham in
arm and lung about a week ago, was
arraigned before Judge Mogan on the
charge of assault with Intent to com
mit murder, and Attorney Albert John
son asked that he.be admitted to bail
in the sum of $1000. Mr. Durham, who
appeared with his wounded arm In a
sling, objected to bail being 'accepted,
as he feared* that the defendant, if
liberated, rftlght take another shot at
him, to which the Judge replied that
under the law he could not refuse to
accept ball, as the charge was not
murder, so he fixed the bond at $2000
and set the hearing for July 9.
M. P. Douglass of Oakdale came to
the city to visit relatives and at Fourth
and* Townsend' streets ran afoul of
Timothy Nyhan, who was drunk and
combative. Although Timothy Is a
longshoreman and not directly con
cerned In thq strike of the railroad
freight handlers, he accused Mr. Doug
lass of being there for the purpose of
"scabbing" and followed up the ac
cusation with a blow that blackened
one of -Mr. Dfeuglass' eyes. The man
from Oakdale resented both the ac
cusation and the blow by grappling
Timothy, and they were down and hit
ting In the clinch when the policeman
cut in. Timothy will be sentenced to
day for battery.
"Special rights to all and equal privi
leges to none," muttered Clerk Grey
as Mrs. Kugal retired.
Inability to make both ends meet by
means of retailing groceries alone was
Mrs. Ernestine Kugal's excuse for sell
ing liquor wlthoqt a license at Noe
and Twenty-third streets. Questioning
by Judge Mogan, however, developed
the fact that Mr. Kugal Is employed in
the Eagle Brewery and draws a salary
of $25 a week. .
"Unless you must have more luxuries
than the ordinary wage-earner and htu
family can afford, I see no reason why
you should swell your Income by
breaking the law," said the Judge to
the defendant. "You are guilty as
charged and I will -sentence you to
morrow."
The unnatural mother did not return
to her home until yesterday morning,
and then she was far gone in intoxi
cation. In court she did not seem to
realize the enormity of her offense, but
advanced the specious plea that she
had been visiting relatives and had
aided in the. consumption of one bottle
of beer and no more. The Judge In
formed her, that in all his experience
on the bench he had never been con
fronted with a complaint more clearly
proved or a defendant less entitled to
leniency. She will be sentenced to-day.
The little ones are In custody of the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Children. Mrs. McCarthy is about
thirty-flve years of age.
\ There were tears in the voice of Pa
tiolman Maloney as he told of the
shameful way in which Mrs. Elizabeth
McCarthy had neglected her live small
children, and the corroborative testi
mony of Patrolman Colemah was also
delivered in tones that reflected deep
feeling. A more distressing story had
seldom been unfolded Â¦ in the Police
Court. - "A Â¦
Mrs. McCarthy resides at 533 Eliza
beth street, and as her husband is. a
deckhand on a rlvev steamboat, he is
seldom at home. Neighbors give him
credit for being ignorant of the cruel
way in which his children were treated
through the drunkenness of their moth
er, as he appeared to be very fond of
the little ones and spent- most â¢ of his
time with them when he was ashore.
It was during his absences that they
were left to suffer starvation or expo
sure while the woman thAt- bore them
was either helplessly mtoxicate'd at
home or reveling elsewhere.
The two officers testified that at 9:30
o'clock Tuesday evening they met an
eight-year-old girl on the street, and
she was crying bitterly. In response to
their questioning she said her mother
had been gone- from home since morn
ing, leaving a nine-months-old babe in
a cradle and locking out her four other
children, of which she was the eldest.
She led the officers to a sandlot where
two little ones lay asleep in each
other's arms, and then she took them
to where she had left her four-year-old
brother propped against an abandoned
building, where he slumbered. Gath
ering up the tiny unfortunates the po
licemen went to the house on Elizabeth
street, where they found the door
lock, as the little girl had stated. A
shove of two sturdy shoulders removed
the obstacle, and from a cradle in a
rear room came the weak cries of an
infant. No time was lost In conveying
the five children to the Receiving Hos
pital, where they were fed and put to
bed.

The Acapulco, Captain Russell was 20
days IS hours coming from Panama.
She brought 28 passengers, 1537 tons of
cargo and treasure valued at $29,400.
Her passengers, most of whom were
from New York, included the. following
named:
Narciea Palaslas, Mrs. Elizabeth Heals,
Miss Maria c;u<?rra. Miss Mary K. Leavell,
Miss Anna M. Wood. Miss Mercedes Guerra,

transit to Hongkong.
There was a brisk demand "for labor
at Panama when, the Acapulco sailed.
Work on the canal has not been begun
but quart*- rs, built on the hiils for the
laborers to be employed on the hercu
lean task, are already under construc
tion.
Although the people who arrived here
yesterday from Panama en the Pacillo
Mail Company's liner Acapulco report
everything qulvt along the coast, the
general belief is that trouble is immi
nent in Nicaragua. President Zelaya,
they say, has acquired the enmity of
the wealthy cltliens of the republic
and they are scheming to overthrow
him. He has ruled the republic for
jnany years. He rose from a lowly sta
tion in life and since he attained h!s
present position has shown -undue fa
voritism, It is said, for the class from
which he. sprung.
Zelaya â¢ dislikes foreigners and is
said to be doing all he can to drive.ail
aliens, Americans particularly.' from
within the borders of Nicaragua.
"We will have ali the foreigners driv
en out in two years," he is quoted as
having ea.id on a recent occasion,- "and
thtn we will have good times."
When the Acapulco was at Corinto a
British commission was there trying to
collect snme of the Â£125,000 indemnity
that England demanded from the Nica
raguan Government for the violation of
a franchise granted a syndicate of
English banTfers. , ,Â¦

He Is no Imitator. His work is upon original
lines: Pure thought, clear vision. He tells
you what you de6lre to know and works in the
open light.
He Is as conspicuous for his wonderful occult
analysis as he Is for his original expression
and vivid truthfulness.
A test reading Is not a life reading; when
you call on Prof. Livingstone he will give you
a full life reading for $1; a test is of little
value: when the mind is troubled you need
more substantial aid and advice; this Is Just
what Prof. Livingstone gives you when you call
on him for a first-class clairvoyant reading.
He asks you no questions, but tells you what
you wish to know.
Would It not be a relief to know how you
will succeed, to be relieved of the matters
that are troubling you. and of the schemes of
your enemies, that you may meet with better
success?
He does not mention all the Ills and misfor-
tunes you are heir to; you are acquainted with
the facts In your case; let Prof. Livingstone
analyze the matters that are troubling you.
find the cause of the trouble and suggest the
remedy.
His only reason for giving your name In full

Is that he does this Incidentally as a chain to

SLOCUM CASE WILIj GO
TO FEDERAIi GRAND JURY
CLEVELAND, June 29.â Tha Mer
chant Marine Commission continued
its hearinr to-day ajid adjourned, to
meet at Milwaukee July 15. H. O.
Colby, manager of the Pittsburg: Steam,
ship Company, which operates 112 large
vessels on the Great Lakes, said:
"I want to see tho Chinese throw
away his chopsticks and take up an
American, knife and fork to eat Ameri
can buckwheat cakes. That's what It
will mean, too, when our shipping In
terests have been rehabilitated.
"The revival of the American ship on
the ocean means the extension of our
markets. Transportation is the magic
wand between the producers and the
consumer and we must not forget it."
Reviewing the lake carrying business,
with which he has been so intimately
associated, Mr. Colby took exceptions
to the expression of the commission
that lake freight carriers have been
subsidized by the Government
He said that all people have received
as much benefit* as the vessel owners
themselves from the marine improve
ments at the various ports. As an in
stance he cited the fact that it is now
possible to carry a ton of coal from here
to Duluth as cheaply as the same
amount can be shoveled from the side
walk into the cellar of a Cleveland resi
dence.

There were heavy receipts of 666n sacks of
Bran from Washington, but the market showed
no change.
Receipts of Hay were lighter and the mar
ket continued unsettled. *
The circular of Somers & Co. said of Hay:
"Shipments of Hay have been increasing dur
ing the past week, the total for the week Just
ending amounting to 3400 tons, an increase of
600 tons over the week preceding. There is
Ktlll quite a quantity of old Hay -coming, al
though each day brings an Increase In the
proportion of new crop. As Is generally
known, the 4th of July is the date for changing
over to the new crop with many consumers.
Therefore, although there Is some difference
in the price between old Hay and new at pres
ent, yet we believe that within a week or ten
days there will be practically no distinction
between the tw o kinds.
-"The most interesting matter to be con
sidered at present is that of the prices to be
established on new Hay for the next two
months. Many farmers seem disposed to hold
for high prices, and it has been reported that
meetings have been held In some districts for
the purpose of e-tabllshing a price at which
the local crop shall be held. We fear that
with the comparatively light demand and the
rather bountiful crop that all such 1 arrange
ments will be useless this season and that Hay
must sell this year at somewhat lower prices
than it brought last season.
"Good new Wheat Hay Is coming quite
freely, and. although some choice grades have
been bringing from $12 to $12 50. yet the pre
vailing price on good quality Is from $10 50
to $11 50. Tame Oat Is bringing from $9 ftO

NEW TORK. June 29.â The principal in
terest attaching In to-day's stock market was
the question as to vrhether it would score a
new low record for dullness, but while it \*
possible to point out isolated occasions when.
tor a tir.g'e day, there was less business done
on the ttock Exchange than on any^day in
the current dullness, it U undeniable that the
lack of interest in the stock market and the
dullness of the average business for a given
period gtemt to have been achieved at small
outlay. The regular attendance in Wall street Is
6triki*ngly depleted, which is manifest not only
to a casual observer, but also in the reduced
requirements for ordinal y service and also
for office room. An ingenious calculator points
out that the total sales of stock for the present
average of business would yield in full con
missions only a few dollars a day to each
cf the members of the exchange. Of course
much of the business yields only part cotn-
Hiissions from one member to another, while
the room -trader, who operates on his own ac
count, yield* no communion to any member.
Dieec'seion is heard among the .less serious
minded of the advisability of closing the ex
change entirely on Saturdays, the recees prov
ing a futility to the mtnds of those eager for
holiday privileges. Such considerations, little
sÂ»ricus as they eeem. give the only adequate
conception of the little importance attached
to taÂ» present market. It Is scarcely fair to
â¢ ttrlbiite the sluggish fluctuations In suchi
narrow trading tr. consideration of such vast
issues as the country's crops, the course of
business ar.d pi asperity as a whole and ns a
: barometer cf events of so prodigious a char
j after to ccrce. The present market can only
' be aeoÂ«Tt<Â»d 8S an Index of profound uncer
tainty and !*rk ot conviction over the future
rouiVe of event* anl developments are awaited
to dissolve the uncertainty.
Bonds were dutl and irregular, but with an
Investment drmand for many dormant issues.

EVAPORATED APPLES â The market for "
Receipts of deciduous fruits, while more
liberal than on Tuesday, were not excessive
and prices for most descriptions were well
maintained under a good call for export pur
poses- and a steady demand far local consump
tion. Good hard Apricots, wrapped Peaches
and choice offerings of Plums, Prunes and
Apples were wanted for shipment on the
Pugtt Sound steamer and cleaned up well,
with occasional lots selling at a slight advance
over the maximum quotations. The canners
were still In the market for Apricots and were
offering from f20 to S35 per ton as to color,
eize and quality, but dealers held firmer views
and the bulk of the receipts were hauled to

ket 2^c per pound was an extreme figure.
Flfrs were still abundant and ruled weak,
while Cherries and Currants were well cared
for at the previously quoted rates. Berries
were plentiful and easy except for the very
best offerings. Receipts of Strawberries were

' CHICAGO. June 29. â While sentiment In th-!
wheat pit at the start was quite bearish,
reports of additional rains in the Southwest
prevented any great selling pressure. Initial
quotations on September were a shade lower
at 80V4c Considerable liquidation soon de
veloped In July. There was also much chang
ing from July to September, affecting bearishly
the nearby delivery. The weakness of July
had a depressing Influence en the distant fu
tures, causing September to sell off to SOÂ«fce.
An absence of outside speculative interest em
phasized the heavy tone prevailing. Toward
noon, however, rumors of adverse reports re
garding winter wheat were elrc&lated. Buy-
Ing by houses supposed to have thexe reports
started the market on an upward course. News
from the Southwest was especially bullish. A
Minneapolis crop expert's crop report told
of damage by rain to wheat in Kansas and
Missouri. The Â«?tatement3 of this authority
were rartially confirmed by the report of an
other expert, who stated that from a recent
survey of conditions in the Southwest a big
reduction In the winter wheat yield "must be
made. An additional bull factor that Influ
enced traders during the last half hour was
a report from Kansas City to the effect that
a severe rainstorm was In progress in Okla
homa. The market closed strong and near
the high point, final figures on September being
at SI He
A feature of trading In corn" was liquida
tion of July and the changing from that month
to later deliveries. September opened un
changed to a shade lower at 4S\4@4S%c, *old
between 4SHc and 49%@4$%c and closed at
thÂ« tc;>.
A steady tone prevailed in oatst September
opened unchanged at 31 %c. sold between 31*,e
and 32Vic and closed at 32Â®32tt&
Provisions were easier on general liquida
tion. Commission houses were on both sides
of the market, and there was a fairly large
trade. Covering by shorts caused a moderate"
recover}-, but closing prices were lower on
all products. September pork being down 7&C.

FUTURES.
CASH WHEAT.
WHEATâ Paris futures were higher, but
Liverpool futures were weak and the spot
market was neglected. The English decline
waa caused by rains in Argentina and Russia
and heavy selling orders from Europe. Rain
was reported in Roumania. Broomhall states
'that the Roumanian wheat crop Is estimated
at 44.0CO.00O bushels, against "4.000,000 last
year.
Chicago was higher on unfavorable crop re
ports, and the pit crowd was buying on Snow"s
report, which was considered bullish. There
were continued rains in the Missouri Valley,
which were doing damage. The Kansas rivers:
were out of their banks and the bottoms were
overflown, it being the third flood ot_the sea
son. Bad reports were coming In freely, and
it looks like a wet harvest in the winter wheat
belt. Jones' estimate corroborates these report*
and gives a winter Wheat crop of 344,000.000
bushels, against 401.000.000 last year, a loss of
57.000.000. 1 He gives Kansas 72.000,000 bushels
and Oklahoma 19,000.000. The Ohio Valley
will be very short and will have to buy
throughout the year.
This market was dull and easy, though fu
tures were somewhat higher.

The spirit of boom Is on the Butter market
and It is without rhyme or reason, as receipts
are liberal and there is a large stock here.
The situation is developing many absurdities.
Even thÂ» boomers admit that the advance Is
unwarranted by current conditions and that
the rise is to say the least Injudicious. Some
houses ara putting up prices . to- make others
"siefc of it" and to give them "all they want. \
and do not hesitate to say so. Others, as
said before, want to import Eastern Butter
and use the advanced California goods as an
umbrella to permit them to work off their
Eastern goods, no matter whether stocks of
California are heavy or not. Others ask the
advance because they are compelled to follow
the procession, though they make wry faces
over It. The whole trade is growling over the
situation and each house apparently ha* Its
knife sharpened for its neighbors. Out of this
chaoa normal conditions may be suspended for
some days but the sooner this foolish business
Is over the better It will be for the trade.
Some houses have stopped storing and have or
dered their Butter to be sent in in cases in
stead of cubes hereafter, which will lncreaae
the supply of fresh just so much.

plenty coming In. Strictly fine ranch are not

The land involved Is located in Santa
Cruz and was acquired by Mitchell a
short time ago. Later Devine and
Lahusen undertook the disposition of
the tract on the raffle plan and sold
tickets at 50 cents apiece. The winning
number was to be decided by the suc
cessful number in a lottery drawing
this month and Jones proved the lucky
holder.. When Jones went to claim his
prize Mitchell refused to turn It over
to him and the bookbinder is looking
for somebody's scalp. Mitchell says
that the two firemen took an option on
the property for $1500 and agreed that
he should receive that amount. Just
previous to the drawing he received
about $635 and, he avers, until the de
ficit Is made up he will refuse to trans
fer the property.
Devlne and Lahusen say that Mitchell
asked them to assist In disposing of
the land for him. Both are positive
that no specified consideration was
stated, but that Mitchell was willing to
take whatever the lottery plan would
realize. A few days before the draw-
Ing $635 had been raised and the fire
men Bay they called upon Mitchell and
asked him If he was willing to part
with his 160 acres of land for that
amount. They state that Mitchell told
them he was and thereupon they noti
fied Jones to come and receive his re
ward. â¢ Mitchell's sudden change of
mind is. a matter that they cannot
fathom, but they have hopes of settling
the matter amicably. Mitchell still re
tains the $635 and although demands
have been made for the cash he re
fuses to release it.
Jones says he will wait until Satur
day for the belligerents to come to
some understanding. Yesterday he vis
ited President George Boyne of the
Fire Commission and though no com
plaint has yet been officially filed, both
Devine and Lahusen are likely to find
themselves in difficulty unless the mat
ter is adjusted.
FTeot'L. Jonev* manager of the book
bindery department of H. A. Crocker
& Co., "won 160 acres of land In a lot
tery scheme last week, but he has yet
failed to receive his prize, and the
Board of Fire Commissioners will prob
ably be called upon to probe a scan
dal, owing to the fact that two mem
bers of the department appear as pro
moters In the matter. The firemen In
volved are Lieutenant John Devlne and
Hoseman George W. Lahusen of en
gine 37. Thomas Mitchell of 1339 Utah
street, father of ex-Senator Thomas F.
Mitchell, owns the property In dispute,
but refuses to release it on the ground
that the firemen who sold the tickets
and handled the cash have not acted
in good faith, and Jones will ask re
dress from the Commissioners. Both
Devihe and Lahusen deny Mitchell's
accusations and say that the latter
was given all that was coming to him
for the property.
Yesterday morning -Mies Carrie
Sewell, the mirse in charge of ward J,
carried breakfast to- the two men at the
regular time. Shortly after Miss
Sewell left the room. Dr. W. A. Mor
ton passed along the hall and heard,
screams coming from room J. He en
tered and found Maranta crushing the
life out of Allen. Without any weapon
except his bare hands and feet Maran^
ta had mangled the old man beyond
recognition. Dr. Morton cried for help
as the young Italian sprang J at him,
crying in broken English that Allen
XUKSE SAW PATIENTS.
The body of Robert Allen lifs at the
Morgue and his murderer is strapped
to a cot in the insane* ward of the
-Emergency Hospital. Allen, who was
72 years of age, was killed by Buonorno
Maranta, a young Italian, who became
violently mad yesterday morning at
the City and County Hospital. Insan
ity is given as the cause of the mur
der and the condition of the murderer
bears out that couclusion.
Robert Allen was a laborer living at
712 Front street. A stroke of paraly<?is
on June 20 necessitated, his removal to
the City and County Hospital. Prior to
Allen's arrival at the county institu
tion, Maranta had : been admitted' for
lung trouble, assigned to the general
ward and placed among theopatients In
charge of Dr. Dunn.
Allen was in the same ward, but
Tuesday afternoon he became deliriou?
and was removed to room J, so * that
his noise would not disturb the other
patients. Shortly after the transfer of
Allen, Maranta became noHy and was
put in the room with Allen. \
Maranta is about 25 years pf age
and has an athletic frame. He weighs
about 185 pounds, though small of stat
ure. Nothing can be learned of, his
antecedents. At 423^ J Broadway,
where \ he resided before >Â£oing to the
hospital, little or nothing-Is "known of
him. He 'has been in San Francisco
for about four months, having j come
fr<>m New York direct after landing
from Italy. His effects show that at
some time he has been a sailor, but
when asked by the interpreter how he
came to San Francisco he said he had
.a horse and buggy. 1
Maranta had" evidently dragged Al
len from his couch and . pounded his
head .on the floor while applying his
fist on the old man's features. Scream
after scream he voiced and with each
cry he struck the old man either with
his fist or Jumped on him with his feet.
Some idea of the. fury of the insanity
which controlled the young Italian can
be surmised from the fact, that both
of Allen's shoulder blades were broken,
the left leg fractured and the head
jammed almost to a pulp:.' Death must
have enshrouded Allen long before the
insane man completed his work oÂ£ an
nihilation. An examination of the body
shows also that the jaw was broken
and. three ribs fractured.
" The attention of the Board of Health
has been called to the fact that the two
men were left alone in the room. An
Investigation .will be. held.
MARANTA IS STRONG.
Rrrbert Allen was 72 yeajs of age.
He "has resided in San Francisco for
several years, but he, has no' known
relatives. At different .times he worked
along the water front Jas a laborer "but
had no steady occupation. At his late
Residence nothing is known regarding
his prior life beyond the fact that he
was a Scotsman. . .Â¦ g
had been causing spirits to hound him
and give Him pain.
Attendants "responded to Dr. Mor-*
ton's cries and after a neree struggle
Maranta was placed in a straitjacket.
An attendant of the hospital ques
tioned Maranta as to why he had kill
ed the old man. "Spirits and .spirits,"
was all" the murderer would say.
Prayer after prayer he uttered while
his eyes rested on the battered corpse
on the floor. t>nce he smiled as he
sazed on his ghastly work and mut
tered a prayer of thanks for having rid
himself of the cause of his supposed
troubles.

LAND LOTTERY
MAKES TROUBLE
Little was done in Judge Lawlor's
courtroom yesterday aside from read
ing the entries of receipts and ship
ments of wheat from the books of Ep
pinger & Co. Sheriff Veale of Contra
; Costa County was placed on the stand
with a view to impeaching the testi
mony of James Deming, but after a
few questions he was withdrawn. W.
W. Topping was then subjected to a
' rigid examination regarding certain en
1 tries in the books and his methods of
bookkeeping.
.. He was in the habit of balancing
from the stock list about three times
a year, but could not remember as to
any balances made between June 1,
1902, and June 1, 1903. â¢
When asked why an- increase of
about one- third had been made in the
amount .of - wheat after it passed
â¢thro'ugh the grader he said the greater
weight was due to swelling from
moisture. ' ; "
'"How did you estimate thls?'Vwaa
asked.
"I had no method of estimating It."
"How then did you come to make
those entries?"
"I made them from the warehouse re
ceipts."
"How do you know that there was
an Increase in the weight of grain by
cause of moisture?"
"I do hot know It."
The examination of Topping will be
continued to-day.
TOPPING TESTIFIES.
The summons thus issued at the re
quest of the defense stated that after
the failure Henry Wadsworth as re
ceiver came into possession of certain
books of the firm, among them being
a cash book, a check book and a num
ber of papers. This property, it is
stated, the defendant Jias reason to.be
lieve was turned over to J. C. Campbell
and Lewis F. Byington. Demands had*
been made for the possession^ of this
property or at least an opportunity to
inspect it, but they had been denied.
"In answer to the summqns Campbell
and Byington appeared" before Referee
Oreen yesterday afternoon and secured
a continuance of the hearing untfil 1:3*
p, m. to-dav. In the' cqurse of the
argument for a continuance Attorney.
Ach denounced the â¢ attorneys for the
prosecution; stating that they had, with
the assistance of Detective Thomas
Gibson, procured the books from "Wads
worth by misrepresentation. He alleges
that Wadsworth, before delivering up
the books, had been informed by the
prosecution that they were already ad
mitted* in evidence. ; . , â¢
FRAUD IS ALLEGED.
T..e legal battle for the possession of
the books of the defunct grain firm of
Eppinger & Co. was begun in earnest
yesterday morning when the attorneys
for the prosecution were served with an
order summoning them to appear be
fore Milton J. Green, referee in bank
ruptcy, and show cause why the books
should not be given to the defense.
The serving of the papers, which was
made by an attache of the office of
Henry Ach, created considerable diver
sion in the corridors of the H.all of Jus
tice. Mr. Campbell was served while
District Attorney Byington was in his
office. Immediately upon his receipt of
the papers Campbell gave the cue to
Mr. Mansfield, one of his assistants, and
Mansfield and the server of the papers
sprinted down the corridor to Bylng
ton's office. Mansfield had the start
and was first over the tape, or
rather into the door, and the District
Attorney was warned to keep under
cover until the books were introduced
in evidence. This he did, and the
papers were not served on him until
an hour later. Meanwhile the contents
of the books, showing the amounts of
grain owned by Epplnger & Co., were
being read into the record.
It is further provided: "Should there
be more than the per cents indicated
above I will it to be divided equally on
the second and third bequests here
of.' Under this clause about 85 per
cent of the estate, or a sum approxi
mating $1200, goes to Michael Maloney
and Mrs. Peterson. This disposition
of the property was made by will on
September 26, 1903. shortly after he
Â¦was taken from th<Â» Veterans' Home
and at the time that the petition to
declare him incompetent and in need
of a guardian was on file.
Thomas McDonald, it is acknowl
edged, had no living kin. It is pos-
Eible that the Attorney General of the
State may take note of the proceed
ings in Napa County. If the money
in the McDonald estate does not go to
the home, a* the art of Congress pro
vides, or escheat to the State of Cali
fornia, the State Legislature at its next
cession may demand an accounting.
Fourth, that 10 per cent shall go
to Father Conwuy, acting pastor of
the Catholic church at Xapa. for the
benefit of the orphan asylum of the
church.
The old man was taken to Xapa City
for shelter and solace under the aus
pices of the interested parties, but
he did not long survive the change of
EurroundingF. He died, leaving a will,
and now the somewhat astonishing
fact is disclosed that the will is dated
about the time th:tt the court declared
that he was not competent to man
age his own affairs and the same court
admits this will to probate.
The will provides first that a sum
not exceeding 5100 shall be expended
for a monument to mark his grave.
Second, that 10 per cent shall go to
Michael Maloney.
Third, that 10 per cent shall go to
Mrs. L. C. Peterson.
The order of the Superior Court of
Napa County admitting to probate the
Â¦will of Thomas McDonald adds an
other chapter to a remarkable story.
McDonaJd was an old soldier, who
died at the age of 82 years. He en
listed in the United States regular
army in 1S44 at Newport. Ky. He
â¢was admitted to the Veterans' Home,
Yountville, fourteen years ago and
dwelt in peace and contentment there
until last September, when it was dis
covered that he had f 700 in a savings
bank and $1000 to his credit with the
treasurer of the home. Immediately
after this discovery a remarkable in
terest in the old veteran's welfare was
manifested. It was the judgment of
his new advisers that he was not cap
able of managing so large a fortune,
therefore the f unerior Court of Napa
County was petitioned to declare him
Incompetent and to appoint a guardian
for him. Th<> petition was duly pre
sented by Bell. York & Bell, attorneys.
The court adjudged him incompetent
and appointed Robert C. Little as his
gnardian.
All the money to McDonald's credit
with the treasurer of the home was
demanded in legal form and it was
paid over to the guardian. The old
veteran's discharge from the home was
demanded, and, of course, could not
be denied.
The legal time for hearing the orig-^
inal case would have expired on June'
10, that being within the twenty-day;,
period prescribed by the law for dls T
posing of such charges.
On Judge Cook's return from vaca
tion, says Collins, the action will be"
started anew.
Because of the above entitled' matter fcaving
been Irregularly transferred frpm department
No, 12 to department No. 3, $.nd in renion-
Btranca against said irregularity." the above
entitled matter is hereby dlsmtnsed. but*with
out prejudice to a new and similar proceeding
when the conditions which induce this dis
missal no longer operate to prevent an orderly
administration of the law. â¢ s
Attorney Collins appeared before
Judges Graham and Troutt yesterday
and objected to the transfer, alleging
that Judge Cook had arranged to hear
it on July Ja. He then wrote the fol
lowing letter to Commissioner Hut
ton:
Dear Sir: I am In receipt of a letter irom
you, dated yesterday and delivered 'to nf* this
morning:, evidently pne day late. I positively
refuse to permit Judg^ TrÂ«utt to hear the'mat
ter to which you refer. I will also ask the
presiding Judge to vacate the order of trans
fer upon thÂ«Â» grround " that" it was irregularly
made. Judge Cook" will be here July 0 prox.'
and will then hÂ«ar the case, and- I do not
propose to have the convenience or purposes
of yourself or your attorneys interfere- with
the orderly administration of the law. I will
make known my objections to Judsre Troutt at
one*. I do not propose to. submit to" any
questionable manipulation 4n any litigation in
which -1 am ' Interested Respectfully,
GEO. D. COfaLINS, â¢
. -Attorney fer Prosecution.
After explaining to Judges Graham
and Troutt.that he would'object to the
transfer Collins filed the following dis^.
missal and says'he will beg\n the case
anew on Judge Cook's return:
This complaint was filed In the Su
perior Court during the middle of
June and Judge Kerrigan assigned it
to Judge Cook's court on the ground
thajt Cook was familiar with the crim
inal suits out of which grew the pend
ing litigation.
Judge Cook had the case set for>
trial on July 6, arranging to return
from his vacation and hear it on that
day. So the matter stood yesterday
forenoon.
Yesterday afternoon, however, At
torney Gavin McNab, for Hutton.
made an ex parte application to have
the case transferred to Judge Troutt's
department. This action was agree
able to Attorney Riordan and McNab
on' behalf of the accused Commis
sioner.
There is pending in Judge Cook's
court a suit that questions the" Police
Commissioner's right to act as "spe
cial chief of police for Xo. 1129
Dupont street," and that would Im
peach him for assuming unlawful
powers.
Each chapter of the legral battle
directed by Attorney George D. Col
lins against Police Commissioner Hut
ton grows more spicy. The last case
is really a fight to remove Hutton
from office.

The land involved Is located in Santa
Cruz and was acquired by Mitchell a
short time ago. Later Devine and
Lahusen undertook the disposition of
the tract on the raffle plan and sold
tickets at 50 cents apiece. The winning
number was to be decided by the suc
cessful number in a lottery drawing
this month and Jones proved the lucky
holder.. When Jones went to claim his
prize Mitchell refused to turn It over
to him and the bookbinder is looking
for somebody's scalp. Mitchell says
that the two firemen took an option on
the property for $1500 and agreed that
he should receive that amount. Just
previous to the drawing he received
about $635 and, he avers, until the de
ficit Is made up he will refuse to trans
fer the property.
Devlne and Lahusen say that Mitchell
asked them to assist In disposing of
the land for him. Both are positive
that no specified consideration was
stated, but that Mitchell was willing to
take whatever the lottery plan would
realize. A few days before the draw-
Ing $635 had been raised and the fire
men Bay they called upon Mitchell and
asked him If he was willing to part
with his 160 acres of land for that
amount. They state that Mitchell told
them he was and thereupon they noti
fied Jones to come and receive his re
ward. â¢ Mitchell's sudden change of
mind is. a matter that they cannot
fathom, but they have hopes of settling
the matter amicably. Mitchell still re
tains the $635 and although demands
have been made for the cash he re
fuses to release it.
Jones says he will wait until Satur
day for the belligerents to come to
some understanding. Yesterday he vis
ited President George Boyne of the
Fire Commission and though no com
plaint has yet been officially filed, both
Devine and Lahusen are likely to find
themselves in difficulty unless the mat
ter is adjusted.
FTeot'L. Jonev* manager of the book
bindery department of H. A. Crocker
& Co., "won 160 acres of land In a lot
tery scheme last week, but he has yet
failed to receive his prize, and the
Board of Fire Commissioners will prob
ably be called upon to probe a scan
dal, owing to the fact that two mem
bers of the department appear as pro
moters In the matter. The firemen In
volved are Lieutenant John Devlne and
Hoseman George W. Lahusen of en
gine 37. Thomas Mitchell of 1339 Utah
street, father of ex-Senator Thomas F.
Mitchell, owns the property In dispute,
but refuses to release it on the ground
that the firemen who sold the tickets
and handled the cash have not acted
in good faith, and Jones will ask re
dress from the Commissioners. Both
Devihe and Lahusen deny Mitchell's
accusations and say that the latter
was given all that was coming to him
for the property.
Yesterday morning -Mies Carrie
Sewell, the mirse in charge of ward J,
carried breakfast to- the two men at the
regular time. Shortly after Miss
Sewell left the room. Dr. W. A. Mor
ton passed along the hall and heard,
screams coming from room J. He en
tered and found Maranta crushing the
life out of Allen. Without any weapon
except his bare hands and feet Maran^
ta had mangled the old man beyond
recognition. Dr. Morton cried for help
as the young Italian sprang J at him,
crying in broken English that Allen
XUKSE SAW PATIENTS.
The body of Robert Allen lifs at the
Morgue and his murderer is strapped
to a cot in the insane* ward of the
-Emergency Hospital. Allen, who was
72 years of age, was killed by Buonorno
Maranta, a young Italian, who became
violently mad yesterday morning at
the City and County Hospital. Insan
ity is given as the cause of the mur
der and the condition of the murderer
bears out that couclusion.
Robert Allen was a laborer living at
712 Front street. A stroke of paraly<?is
on June 20 necessitated, his removal to
the City and County Hospital. Prior to
Allen's arrival at the county institu
tion, Maranta had : been admitted' for
lung trouble, assigned to the general
ward and placed among theopatients In
charge of Dr. Dunn.
Allen was in the same ward, but
Tuesday afternoon he became deliriou?
and was removed to room J, so * that
his noise would not disturb the other
patients. Shortly after the transfer of
Allen, Maranta became noHy and was
put in the room with Allen. \
Maranta is about 25 years pf age
and has an athletic frame. He weighs
about 185 pounds, though small of stat
ure. Nothing can be learned of, his
antecedents. At 423^ J Broadway,
where \ he resided before >Â£oing to the
hospital, little or nothing-Is "known of
him. He 'has been in San Francisco
for about four months, having j come
fr<>m New York direct after landing
from Italy. His effects show that at
some time he has been a sailor, but
when asked by the interpreter how he
came to San Francisco he said he had
.a horse and buggy. 1
Maranta had" evidently dragged Al
len from his couch and . pounded his
head .on the floor while applying his
fist on the old man's features. Scream
after scream he voiced and with each
cry he struck the old man either with
his fist or Jumped on him with his feet.
Some idea of the. fury of the insanity
which controlled the young Italian can
be surmised from the fact, that both
of Allen's shoulder blades were broken,
the left leg fractured and the head
jammed almost to a pulp:.' Death must
have enshrouded Allen long before the
insane man completed his work oÂ£ an
nihilation. An examination of the body
shows also that the jaw was broken
and. three ribs fractured.
" The attention of the Board of Health
has been called to the fact that the two
men were left alone in the room. An
Investigation .will be. held.
MARANTA IS STRONG.
Rrrbert Allen was 72 yeajs of age.
He "has resided in San Francisco for
several years, but he, has no' known
relatives. At different .times he worked
along the water front Jas a laborer "but
had no steady occupation. At his late
Residence nothing is known regarding
his prior life beyond the fact that he
was a Scotsman. . .Â¦ g
had been causing spirits to hound him
and give Him pain.

LAND LOTTERY
MAKES TROUBLE
Little was done in Judge Lawlor's
courtroom yesterday aside from read
ing the entries of receipts and ship
ments of wheat from the books of Ep
pinger & Co. Sheriff Veale of Contra
; Costa County was placed on the stand
with a view to impeaching the testi
mony of James Deming, but after a
few questions he was withdrawn. W.
W. Topping was then subjected to a
' rigid examination regarding certain en
1 tries in the books and his methods of
bookkeeping.
.. He was in the habit of balancing
from the stock list about three times
a year, but could not remember as to
any balances made between June 1,
1902, and June 1, 1903. â¢
When asked why an- increase of
about one- third had been made in the
amount .of - wheat after it passed
â¢thro'ugh the grader he said the greater
weight was due to swelling from
moisture. ' ; "
'"How did you estimate thls?'Vwaa
asked.
"I had no method of estimating It."
"How then did you come to make
those entries?"
"I made them from the warehouse re
ceipts."
"How do you know that there was
an Increase in the weight of grain by
cause of moisture?"
"I do hot know It."
The examination of Topping will be
continued to-day.
TOPPING TESTIFIES.
The summons thus issued at the re
quest of the defense stated that after
the failure Henry Wadsworth as re
ceiver came into possession of certain
books of the firm, among them being
a cash book, a check book and a num
ber of papers. This property, it is
stated, the defendant Jias reason to.be
lieve was turned over to J. C. Campbell
and Lewis F. Byington. Demands had*
been made for the possession^ of this
property or at least an opportunity to
inspect it, but they had been denied.
"In answer to the summqns Campbell
and Byington appeared" before Referee
Oreen yesterday afternoon and secured
a continuance of the hearing untfil 1:3*
p, m. to-dav. In the' cqurse of the
argument for a continuance Attorney.
Ach denounced the â¢ attorneys for the
prosecution; stating that they had, with
the assistance of Detective Thomas
Gibson, procured the books from "Wads
worth by misrepresentation. He alleges
that Wadsworth, before delivering up
the books, had been informed by the
prosecution that they were already ad
mitted* in evidence. ; . , â¢
FRAUD IS ALLEGED.
T..e legal battle for the possession of
the books of the defunct grain firm of
Eppinger & Co. was begun in earnest
yesterday morning when the attorneys
for the prosecution were served with an
order summoning them to appear be
fore Milton J. Green, referee in bank
ruptcy, and show cause why the books
should not be given to the defense.
The serving of the papers, which was
made by an attache of the office of
Henry Ach, created considerable diver
sion in the corridors of the H.all of Jus
tice. Mr. Campbell was served while
District Attorney Byington was in his
office. Immediately upon his receipt of
the papers Campbell gave the cue to
Mr. Mansfield, one of his assistants, and
Mansfield and the server of the papers
sprinted down the corridor to Bylng
ton's office. Mansfield had the start
and was first over the tape, or
rather into the door, and the District
Attorney was warned to keep under
cover until the books were introduced
in evidence. This he did, and the
papers were not served on him until
an hour later. Meanwhile the contents
of the books, showing the amounts of
grain owned by Epplnger & Co., were
being read into the record.
It is further provided: "Should there
be more than the per cents indicated
above I will it to be divided equally on
the second and third bequests here
of.' Under this clause about 85 per
cent of the estate, or a sum approxi
mating $1200, goes to Michael Maloney
and Mrs. Peterson. This disposition
of the property was made by will on
September 26, 1903. shortly after he
Â¦was taken from th<Â» Veterans' Home
and at the time that the petition to
declare him incompetent and in need
of a guardian was on file.
Thomas McDonald, it is acknowl
edged, had no living kin. It is pos-
Eible that the Attorney General of the
State may take note of the proceed
ings in Napa County. If the money
in the McDonald estate does not go to
the home, a* the art of Congress pro
vides, or escheat to the State of Cali
fornia, the State Legislature at its next
cession may demand an accounting.
Fourth, that 10 per cent shall go
to Father Conwuy, acting pastor of
the Catholic church at Xapa. for the
benefit of the orphan asylum of the
church.
The old man was taken to Xapa City
for shelter and solace under the aus
pices of the interested parties, but
he did not long survive the change of
EurroundingF. He died, leaving a will,
and now the somewhat astonishing
fact is disclosed that the will is dated
about the time th:tt the court declared
that he was not competent to man
age his own affairs and the same court
admits this will to probate.
The will provides first that a sum
not exceeding 5100 shall be expended
for a monument to mark his grave.
Second, that 10 per cent shall go to
Michael Maloney.
Third, that 10 per cent shall go to
Mrs. L. C. Peterson.
The order of the Superior Court of
Napa County admitting to probate the
Â¦will of Thomas McDonald adds an
other chapter to a remarkable story.
McDonaJd was an old soldier, who
died at the age of 82 years. He en
listed in the United States regular
army in 1S44 at Newport. Ky. He
â¢was admitted to the Veterans' Home,
Yountville, fourteen years ago and
dwelt in peace and contentment there
until last September, when it was dis
covered that he had f 700 in a savings
bank and $1000 to his credit with the
treasurer of the home. Immediately
after this discovery a remarkable in
terest in the old veteran's welfare was
manifested. It was the judgment of
his new advisers that he was not cap
able of managing so large a fortune,
therefore the f unerior Court of Napa
County was petitioned to declare him
Incompetent and to appoint a guardian
for him. Th<> petition was duly pre
sented by Bell. York & Bell, attorneys.
The court adjudged him incompetent
and appointed Robert C. Little as his
gnardian.
All the money to McDonald's credit
with the treasurer of the home was
demanded in legal form and it was
paid over to the guardian. The old
veteran's discharge from the home was
demanded, and, of course, could not
be denied.
The legal time for hearing the orig-^
inal case would have expired on June'
10, that being within the twenty-day;,
period prescribed by the law for dls T
posing of such charges.
On Judge Cook's return from vaca
tion, says Collins, the action will be"
started anew.
Because of the above entitled' matter fcaving
been Irregularly transferred frpm department
No, 12 to department No. 3, $.nd in renion-
Btranca against said irregularity." the above
entitled matter is hereby dlsmtnsed. but*with
out prejudice to a new and similar proceeding
when the conditions which induce this dis
missal no longer operate to prevent an orderly
administration of the law. â¢ s
Attorney Collins appeared before
Judges Graham and Troutt yesterday
and objected to the transfer, alleging
that Judge Cook had arranged to hear
it on July Ja. He then wrote the fol
lowing letter to Commissioner Hut
ton:
Dear Sir: I am In receipt of a letter irom
you, dated yesterday and delivered 'to nf* this
morning:, evidently pne day late. I positively
refuse to permit Judg^ TrÂ«utt to hear the'mat
ter to which you refer. I will also ask the
presiding Judge to vacate the order of trans
fer upon thÂ«Â» grround " that" it was irregularly
made. Judge Cook" will be here July 0 prox.'
and will then hÂ«ar the case, and- I do not
propose to have the convenience or purposes
of yourself or your attorneys interfere- with
the orderly administration of the law. I will
make known my objections to Judsre Troutt at
one*. I do not propose to. submit to" any
questionable manipulation 4n any litigation in
which -1 am ' Interested Respectfully,
GEO. D. COfaLINS, â¢
. -Attorney fer Prosecution.
After explaining to Judges Graham
and Troutt.that he would'object to the
transfer Collins filed the following dis^.
missal and says'he will beg\n the case
anew on Judge Cook's return:
This complaint was filed In the Su
perior Court during the middle of
June and Judge Kerrigan assigned it
to Judge Cook's court on the ground
thajt Cook was familiar with the crim
inal suits out of which grew the pend
ing litigation.
Judge Cook had the case set for>
trial on July 6, arranging to return
from his vacation and hear it on that
day. So the matter stood yesterday
forenoon.
Yesterday afternoon, however, At
torney Gavin McNab, for Hutton.
made an ex parte application to have
the case transferred to Judge Troutt's
department. This action was agree
able to Attorney Riordan and McNab
on' behalf of the accused Commis
sioner.
There is pending in Judge Cook's
court a suit that questions the" Police
Commissioner's right to act as "spe
cial chief of police for Xo. 1129
Dupont street," and that would Im
peach him for assuming unlawful
powers.
Each chapter of the legral battle
directed by Attorney George D. Col
lins against Police Commissioner Hut
ton grows more spicy. The last case
is really a fight to remove Hutton
from office.
