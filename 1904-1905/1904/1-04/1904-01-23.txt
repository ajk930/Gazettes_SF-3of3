WASHINGTON, Jan. 22.â The State
Department, has received information
within the last twenty-four hours that
makes war, in- the East look far more
imminent than it did forty-eight hours
ago. The War. Department, is; taking
a very, pessimistic view of existing af
fairs, and, according to reliable reports,
the situation' is assuming a serious as

REVIVE FEAR THAT WAR IS AGAIN IMMINENT
WASHINGTON, Jan. 22.â The State
Department confirms the report that
Buchanan, the American Minister to
Panama, "is about to return to the
United States, starting in a few days
from Colon. . Important private busi
ness is assigned as. a reason for the
Minister's return to the United States.
The department is not informed that
his visit is anything more than a leave
of absence, but itknows that' Buchanan
consented to assume the Panama'mis
sion only on the understanding that his
appointment be temporary, and as af
fairs on the isthmus are regarded as
being in. excellent shape from an ad
ministrative standpo^it it Is possible
he will consider that he has carried out
His full understanding when he returns
to Washington.

says 6000 Russian soldiers entered Newclnvang January 19.. The municipal affairs of Newchwang
are managed by a Russian commissioner and' acting on his orders the Chinese merchants displayed
Russian colors when the troops marched into the city.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 22.â The situation in Korea is arousing fresh apprehension of re
newed trouble in the Far East. It has been the, opinion -of military experts that in* the event of war
between Russia and Japan Korea would be made the battleground, at least Â¦ in the beginning. Mr.
Allen, the American Minister at Seoul," cabled the State Department to-day. from Seoul as follows:
"Considerable disturbances throughout Korea. ;' The Japanese ; have ) been : attacked in many
places. ?'}s'' 1 ~'-'-; * 'Â¦Â¦...'Â¦ /':;Â¦.Â¦Â¦Â¦Â¦'Â¦,Â¦â¢'Â¦" * -
"It is learned that in view; of the possibility of Korea being unable to afford proper, protection
to Japanese subjects the .Tokio authorities have dispatched a Japanese military officer of, the highest
rank, namely major general, to Seoul, where he.will be in a position^ to direct any military opera
tions that Japanese troops may undertake. The Korean Government has: -3560 menunder arms, but
they have not been trained in a moctern school'of war, and resemble constabulary^ rather u than sol
diers. It is anticipated here, that japan in 'Korea; will, repeat ,the;perforrnance , of Russia in Man
churia and make the disturbances on the Japanese; railway. theground : for a. military occupation of
the'line in great force, corresponding to the;Russian occupation Jof the Manchurian â¢railway."
Freight cars were torn to splinters,
the trucks from them being hurled
hundreds of foet from the track. The
depot, the hotel, warehouses, gins,
thirty, homes, seven storehouses, to
gether with their stocks, were de
tsiroycdJ "Where they stood it !s impos
sible to find even the pillars upon
which these structures rested. Â¦
Bales of cotton which were stored
in warehouses were torn to atoms, the
fragments of lint lodging in trees, mak

had been visited by a snowstorm. "
Heavy Iron Eafes, the doors of which
in some instances were torn from their

TUSCALOOSA, Ala.. Jan. 22.â A dis-
CFtrous tornado swept over Monnd
villc. Ala., a town of 300 inhabitants,
fifteen mil^s south of Tuscaloosa, early
to-day, and as a result thirty-seven
persons were killed and more than a
hundred were injured. Every business
house, with the exception of a small
leading, Â«tonÂ». was completely de
stroyed. The tornado struck the town
from the southwest and mowed a path
a quarter of a mile wide through it.
FuTgeons were rushed to Moundvillc
from Greensboro and TuEcaloosa, and
all possible was done to alleviate the
sufferings of the injured. By the force
â¢cf the storm persons were blown hun
dreds of fert from their beds.
Through terror a father, mother and
thrrc children fled from their home to
seek refuge and in their excitement
loft a five-year-old boy In bed. To
night he was pulled from beneath some
timber and thus far it Is impossible
to find any other member of the

WASHINGTON, Jan. 22.â Chief Jus

cause he and his associates of the
highest court ot the land were kept
waiting until members of the diplo
matic corps had all passed in line and
had been greeted by the President.
It was a repetition of the dispute
over precedence which frequently came
up before at judiciary receptions. Ac
cording to the rules of procedure laid
down by the State Department, the
diplomatic corps takes precedence over
everybody else.
Count Cassini, the Russian Embas

arrive until after the corps, headed by
the Mexican Embassador, had* started
through the blue room, and greeted the

Chicago Surgeon In
vents Wonderful-
Instrument.
CHICAGO, Jan. 21. â Dr. Fenton B.
Turck of Chicago has devised a scien
tific appliance by which the inside of
a human stomach or any other of the
internal organs may be seen with the
eye and examined for the presence of
disease.
The new instrument, which Dr.
Turck has described for the benefit of
his fellow-surgeons in the Journal of
the American Medical Association, is
based on a system of lenses put to
gether in so small compass that the
whole mechanism can, be used like an
ordinary stomach pump. In the arti
cle, which is accompanied by photo
graphs, Dr. Turck gives much credit
for. invention to Leube, Mikauliez,
Kwald and other European scientists,
but omits to say that " their- instru
ments all failed to work and contents
himself with the statement that In
many tests of his own Invention he has
been able -to obtain clear views of all
parts of the stomach.
"I. have been able with this instru
ment to inspect the pylorus (that is the
farthest extremity of the stomach be
yond its .great curve)," he says In de
scribing its possibilities, "and under
the$ direction of the eye watch the
gyromele ' (a long curved director) pass
through the pyloric orifice into the
duodenum. Moving it back and forth
one can readily watch the distance it
passes Into the intestines."

PITTSBURG. Jan. 22 (midnight.) â
The Allegheny and Monongahela rivers
are rising steadily. The Allegheny is
-three .feet higher than h*r consort
stream and as a consequence a dan
gerous Ice gorge is now forming be
tween the "Wabash and Smithfleld
street bridges Just above the conflu
ence of the rivers.
Early in the day, owing to the warn
ing sent out In regard to the danger
from the Allegheny, all of the coal
barges and steamboats were sent into
the Monongahela to gain the better
protection of the pools and conse
quently stiller water.
Already a barge containing 40.000
bushels of coal has been sunk and the
whole fleet with nearly 275,000 bush
els on board is in danger. In the Penn
sylvania avenue mi U district many of
the mills have their fly pits below
flood level and were compelled to shut
down, throwing 7000 men and boys
out of work. The Big and Little She
nangoes, which meet at Greenville.
are higher than for many years. A
gorge in these streams has backed the
water over the town, causing much
damage.
STREETS 'UNDER WATER.
South Race and Water streets ars
under water. Many families were
taken from their homes In boats,
while others have moved their house
hold goods to the second floors. The
Bessemer railroad shops and the
odge manufacturing plant, both built
above the highwater mark, have been
abandoned. To-night these plants are
under water two feet deep and much
machinery has been ruined. The en
tire Bessemer yards are flooded and
the main line Is being used as a stor
age for locomotives and coaches re
moved-from flooded shops.
At Osgood, two miles north of here,
there is six feet of water on the
Bessemer tracks. The water in Mercer
Is higher thftm it was ever known before
and some stores are flooded. Both the
Neshanock and Shenango rivers, at
Newcastle, have risen more than
thirty-six Inches since morning, and
are at flood stage, with the water
coming up rapidly. The tin plate and
steel mills are closed, and the main
thoroughfares are Impassable.
CREW L.EAVES IN TIME.
During the afternoon Captain Mc-
Kinley of the transportation depart
ment of the Monongahela Coat and
"Coke Company received a telegram
from Sistersville, announcing that the
Hornet No. 2 had sunk in about
twenty-four feet of water and would
probably be a total loss. The crew saw
the impending da'nger In time to es
cape. The boat was valued at about
$10,000.
About 5 o'clock this evening news of
,the sinking of the Volunteer at Browns
Station reached the local headquarters
of the coal combine. The officers and
crew were saved. The Volunteer was
valued at $13,000.
One' river man stated to-night that
the extent of the damage wrought by
the ice to-night could not be. estimated
until to-morrow, .but it will amount to
high into the hundreds of thousands of
dollars. This, coupled with the Ios3e9
sustained by railroads, business
houses, manufacturing, street com
panies and residents will likely put the
less at about $1,000,000. Â¦ ' > " v

WIDOWS.
2,720,000 in the Xation.
105,000. of Them In Xew York City
A Chicago mathematician announces
that Chicago, with 60,396 widows, has
a larger number than any other com
munity in the country. It is added that
the number of widowers in the city is
only 23.0U7. .
As a matter of fact, the State in
which widows are the most numerous
is New York, in which they number
320,000. The city in which they are
most numerous is the city of New York,
where there are 103,000.
There were by the last Federal cen
sus 2,720,000 widows in the whole United
States, of whom, it is worthy to re
mark. 88,000 were in Indiana and only
6000 in Utah.
There were 128,000 in Massachusetts,
less than the total number in the two
States of Alabama and Mississippi,
though the view pretty generally pre
vails that the number of widows is dis
proportionately large throughout New
England. -
There are nearly 2000 in Hawaii and
1700 In Alaska, a proportionately larger
number than in the city of Chicago.

lay, coupled'with d>rpatches from'To

renewal of public nervousness, which
was reflected by' the weakness on the
Bourse to-day. This alarm is seeming

circles, where it is insisted that the
Czar's pacific declarations were not
idle words. The worst that is now an

Special Pis-patch to The Call.
SALT LAKE, Utah. Jan. 22. â Ru
mors that negotiations were pending
for the sale of two of the biggest pro
ducing mines in Utah to the Federal
Mining and Smelting Company were
confirmed to-nisrht. It is now ac
knowledged that within a short time u
sale is probable of the Silver King and
the Daly West, both of Park City and
both heavy producers of silver lead
ore. If the sale is effected, as now ap
pears to be certain, it will be one of
the largest mining transactions ever
recorded in the West. Exactly what
figures are being considered is not
stated, but it is understood that the
consideration is close to $17,000,000.
Confirmation of the negotiations
comes from Charles Sweeny, presi
dent of the Federal Mining and
Smelting Company and the man who
amalgamated, the big silver lead mines
of the Coour d'Alenes last fall. Sweeny
now admits that negotiations looking
lo the purchase of the famous Park
City mines have been under way for
some time. He states that the mines
have been examined by his experts and
that from their reports he has formed
a very hijrh opinion of the properties.
The ore bodies have been carefully ex
amined and found to contain an enor
mous reserve. The Silver Kins: mine
now pays regular monthly dividends
of $100,000 and the Daly West con
tributes Jllf.000 a month m dividends.
Owners of the properties would not
consider a proposition to sell at an
enormous figure a. year ago and it is
stated that they are held with a valua
tion of $10,000,000 for the Silver King
and $7,000,000 for the Daly West.

Assistant Trainmaster of the Northern

Not Heed Signals.
PORTLAND, Jan. 22.â To determine
the efficiency of the employes and to
learn to what extent the rules are
obeyed a series of secret tests are be
ing made over the entire system of
the Northern Pacific Railroad. Several
nights ago Assistant Trainmaster Coyle
of the Pacific division came to Portland
and watched the men running out of
Portland. He stationed Himself at
Scappoose, to ascertain v.-hat attention
the trainmen paid to the signal lights.
His investigation resulted in showing
that the carelessness that had been
demonstrated by similar tests on the
Eastern roads also existed in the West.
Running' out of Portland on the Pacific
division are some of the oldest and
most careful conductors and engineers
on the road, but the majority of them
violated the rules applying to the sig
nals. ' Where a white light is displayed
at a station the track is clear. Where
a red light' is in sight or where no light
shows it is the duty of the trainmen to
await for a clearance". The only train
that obeyed the signal was the north

CLEVELAND, Ohio, Jan. 22. â The
flood situation in - Cleveland and
vicinity is brighter at midnight Friday,

flowing about fifteen miles. an hour and
is slightly lower than during the day.
Three great lake vessels that broke

BUFFALO, N. Y., Jan. 22.â With a
continuous fall of rain for nearly
twenty-four hours, the immense quan

part of New York was rapidly turned
into water, which soon, to-night, sent
the rivers swirling out of bounds, flood

In Northern New York and places in
Canada, where the temperature was
lower, the rain turned into sleet and
snow, prostrating telegraph and tele
phone lines and demoralizing railroad
traffic. Trains on the Grand Trunk and
Canadian Pacific to-night are reported
at from twelve to twenty-four hours
late. The Chicago express, on the
Grand Trunk, arrived at Toronto
twenty-four hours late, after spending

FAMILIES RUN FROM FLOOD,
PARIS,' Jan. 22. â The Chamber of
Deputies was the scene of much ex
citement to-day in connection with the
case of Father Delsor. the Alsatian
priest who -was expelled from France
recently on the ground that he was
a foreigner seeking 1 to foment agita
tion against the Government. His ex
pulsion has revived the animosity
growing out of the Franco-Prussian
war, a considerable element of the
press and public asserting that the ex
pulsion of Delsor as a foreigner
marked the final abandonment of Al
sace to Germany. Premier Combes
declared the agitation had' the same
theatrical character as Boulangerism.
After a long and heated discussion
Premier Combes Intimated that he
would accept a motion made by SI.
Sarrlen as the order of the day pure
and simple, with the understanding
this should be taken to imply approval
of the Government's action.
The division resulted in a Ministerial
victory, the vote being 259 to 243.
During the sitting of the chamber
there was a noisy pro-Alsatian demon
stration in the Place de la Concorde,
which resulted in the arrest of about
sixty persons. Order was restored la

LINCOLN, Neb., Jan. 22.â Chief Jus
tice Holcomb of the Nebraska Supreme
Court to-day granted the request of
Deputy State Auditor Pierce for a tem
porary receiver for the Bankers' Union
of the World, an insurance order with
headquarters in Omaha, and Sheriff
Powers of Omaha was appointed. The
Deputy Auditor alleges that the order
Is insolvent; that all the liabilities
have not been reported; that the
amount due policy-holders and unpaid
is $30,000, and that the assets are only
$2437. E. C. Spinney of Omaha Is pres
ident of the union and his wife is vice
president.
OMAHA, Neb., Jan. 22.â The Bank
ers* Union of the World, for which the
Supreme Court to-day granted a tem
porary receiver, was originated five
years Pgo by Dr. E. C. Spinney, who
has been its president since the charter
was granted; Judge E. P. Holmes oi
Lincoln is* vice president; Elmer II.
Packard, secretary, and M. T. Swartz,
banker. The company has been doing
business in twenty-five States and has
in force about $25,000,000 of insurance.
Its sross receipts for 1S03, according to
a statement just issued, were $135,3S7,
and the claims paid during the same
period amounted to $32,000.
President Spinney stated that the re
ceivership came as an entire surprise
to him, although he admitted that
there had been some difficulty between
the State officers and the company, as
a result, he said, of his declining t<Â»
pay certain" alleged excessive charges
for examination.
He says that on January 1(> the con
cern had $12,000 in cash on hand and
owned other assets worth $35,000. The
allegation that the State Auditor
makes, he said, that $20,000 was paid
him for salary for 1003 was untrue. Re
stated that his salary had been $6000;
that he had been paid about $7000 com
missions, which represented five per
cent allowed him but never drawn on
business for three former years; $1000
paid his wife as salary for editing th*
official paper, and $3000 in stock which
he had placed in the treasury and
which was returned to him by order of
the directors.

The inroads on British commerce
that are being made by foreign ship

tonnage from the great South Waies
docks of London. In 1897 at five of
these docks there arrived 10,122 Brit
ish ships with a tonnage of 10,741,000
tons, and 2640 foreign ships with an
aggregate of 1,875,400 tons. Thus the
Uritish tonage >vas about 85 per cent
of the whole. In 1902 the correspond
ing figures were 13,969 British ships
of 9,745,200 tons, , and* 4017 foreign
ships of 3,607,500 tons. Thus the-

BERLIN, Jan. 22.â Under the presi
dency of â¢ Duke Ernst Guenther zu
SehleswigHolstein, Emperor William's
brother-in-law, th'e Middle European
Economic Society was formally found
ed here last night. It aims to procure
the ; establishment of a middle Euro
pean alliance on the lines proclaimed
by Count Goluchowski, the Austro-
Hungarian Minister for Foreign Af
fairs, several -years ago. The \ presi
dent declared the society was formed
to defend Germany from an overflow
of foreign goods, to strengthen Ger
man capacity in the markets of the
world and above all to meet American
competition. Professor Julius Wolff of
Breslau, the economist and intellectual
founder of the society, explained that
the Idea originated from observation of
American progress, which was due to
the "boundless possibilities opened to
that energetic race by its large unified
domestic market."
It was quite feasible to Introduce a
greater division of labor and special
ization, both in this country and . be
tween the countries embraced in the
plan of the Middle European Economic
Society, with the *view of cheapening
production. A further step would be
a reform of the most favored* nation
principle, which must be brought. info
harmony with reciprocity. Probably
the greatest task of the society, how
ever, will be the creation of economic
alliances between nations with com
mon interest*.
The /society adopted as a cardinal
principle necessity for directing the at
tention of the peoples and governments
of Central Europe to their common eco
nomic interests. â¢ ; .
The meeting was attended by 150
leading economists, politicians, manu
facturers, merchants and land-owners.
It is intended to include in the scope
of the 'operations .of -.the society the
powers forming the Triple Alliance-
France. Switzerland, The Netherlands
and Scandinavia.
MANILA, Jan. 22. â Manager Jours of
the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank,
during thÂ£ public discussion now going
on, prior to the passage of the supple
mental currency act, decided that ,the
banks had a letter from General Mer
ritt,' upon the strength of which the
importation of Mexican dollars was re
sumed after a twenty years' 'proposi
tion; that the importation of this
coin , was not voluntary, he said
upon the part of the banks, but
was forced upon them by the
military authorities practically at
the point of the bayonet. American
soldiers entered the banks, demanding
local currency for gold, some even go
ing to the length of enforcing their de
mands at the muzzle of a revolver.
There were 23,000 troops landed within
three months, to pay whom the quar
termaster and paymaster drew letters
of credit for half a million sterlings,
which Jours on his part found himself
unable to convert into coin, and con
sequently closed the bank. General
Greene then issued an order that un
less the bank opened and changed
these drafts Into money for .the' troops'
he would place Jours under guard, and
threatened to lock him up. The dis

WASHINGTON, Jan. 22.â A confer
ence which, though brief, was pregnant
with significance, was held at the White
House to-tlay between the President
and Senator Foraker. The Senator re
turned yesterday from a sojourn of
several days in Ohio, where he con
ferred with many of his friends re

to irfoim tho President of the result

attempt to relegate Senator Foraker to

might imperil the Integrity of the Re

made.
To-day's conference lasted but a
short time, but the .situation was dis

understood that the President will not
permit himself to be drawn into any
factional trouble, either in Ohio or in
any other State. Senator Foraker
understands the President's position
in this regard. The conference to-day
was not prolonged because the Senator
had an engagement for a committee

CANALS IMPORTANCE.
Dolliver, at the afternoon session,
eafd that since our intervention in the
Cuban war the canal rjuestion had in
creased vastly in importance, and he
predicted that fume of the Democratic
Senators who wore opposing the canal
treaty would find it to be a "burning
question." He deprecated criticism of
thr President in connection with the ,
.Panama revolt, referring to him as k ',
"God-fearing, patriotic man." i
As a precedent for the President's '
recdgniU6a of Panama Dolliver showed
that President Pierce had recognized
five revolutionary governments within
four months.
Patterson of Colorado interrupted to
state that these recognitions were in
accordance with international law;
lhat it was a reebgnition of de facto
governments, and in no case one of
secession. /
"Will the Senator say why twenty
rations of Europe have recognized
Panama?" Queried Dolliver.
"Because the United States set the
pace," replied Patterson. "They rec
ognized that the United States had
created that government, and, wish
ing to continue !n good favor of this
country, they followed its lead."
/'Does international law in Europe
consist of following the blunders and
crimes committed by the United
States?" retorted Dolliver.
Continuing Dolliver declared vehe
mently that the Panama \ revolution
' had been going on for twenty years.
"Talk to me," said Dolliver, "about
the Unitod States interferingn to aid
the insurrection in Panama; the Unit
ed f ites could not have stopped the
insurrection if it had desired to do
so."
Dolliver declared that all that had
been done by the United States in
Panama was "done in obedience to the
requirements of our treaties. I accept
the Secretary of State as my authority
en this Question, for, much as I may
respect the opinion of Senators, I
would accept John Hay's opinion on
such a subject in preference to the
opinions of any of them.. Therefore,
I do not apologize for any of the orders

SAN JOSE, Jan. 22. â There was a
clash between officials and employes of
the Interurban electric railway and <he
San Jose and Santa Clara electric rail
way, on North Market street late this
afternoon, and for a time it looked as
though there would be a riot. As it was
James "W. Rea, president of the Inter
urban company, gave Manager Hugh
Center of the San Jose and Santa Clara
line a good shaking and threw him and
several of his employes off. the track
of the Interurban company. Detective
James Prindiville then drew his club and
threatened to use it upon Rea. Fully a
thousand people gathered, and the ar
rival of a squad of police prevented a
free fight. Â£v'.v
A row has been on between the Inter
urban railway and the San Jose and
Santa Clara line for two months over
the laying of a third rail on North Mar
ket street for use of the latter line.
Monday an injunction tying up the
Interurban road was dissolved. #
Thursday night President Rea had
his men remove the trolley wires that
the San Jose and Santa Clara line had
strung, and this -.afternoon Manager
Center put his men to work placing
the wires again In position, starting
from the broad-gauge depot. Rea also
beg3n placing the Interurban trolley
from the southern end of the line. At
about the same time, Center had a
force tearing up the Interurban's track
at the Santa Clara street crossing to
lay a third rail, which he had by In
junction failed to cause the Interurban
to do. ' Rea and Manager Granger hap
pened on the scene about that time,
and Rea made Center's men stop^the
work. Center came along soon after
ward and ordered the work to proceed.
He took his place in the center of the
track. Rea then grabbed Center and.
after shaking him, threw him to one
side. Detective Prindiville started for
Rea, and threatened to club him,
whereupon some one cried "If you club
him I'll kill you." Rea stood his ground,
and for a time a^flght was imminent.
Rea claims the detective struck him
with his fijt.
Center's men then went to work dig
ging up the cement under police pro
jection. Contractor Elder, hearing of
â¢ the trouble, rushed his men up from
j the other 'end of the road, and they
j brought with them carload of big,
I cement blocks, which* they piled in the
j way of the Center forces. Seeing that
! it was useless to longer battle, Center
withdrew his men.
Rea was served with an injunction
to-night that restrains the Interurban
company from interfering with the
trolley wires of the San Jose and Santa
i Clara road. The Interurban had a gang
| of men stringing trolley wires on the
; rest of its, line to-night, and they also
strung a wire on North Market street,
over the section where Center's men
cut the wires. Contractor Elder to-night
had a gang of forty men armed with
pick-handle^ on guard along the track.
The Interurban company will try to
| have its line in operation to-morrow.
; Shortly before midnight the Inter-
I urban Company sued out an injunc
i tion restraining its rival from inter
i fering with the operation of the road.
There is no more engrossing: question than
that of the relation between labor and capital,
which seems the paramount issue to-day. The
instinct cf working men to band together to ;
protect themselves Is no more to be wondered j
at tha'n the same instinct on the part oC cap
ital. Now, ray plan !s to have organized union !
labor Americanized in the best sense and j
thoroughly educated to an understanding of j
its responsibilities, and in this way to make j
it the ally of the capitalist, rather than a foe
with which to grapple.
It is often asked what is to become of the
non-organized consumer If an amicable alli
ance is made between labor and capital. But
every I man belongs to the one or the other i
group; for that matter he Is likely to belong
to both. Â¦ ,
/ LIKES GOLDEN RULE.
I took lome time to consider the work of;
the Civic Federation and am firmly convinced |
that it la the object to which I desire to!
consecrate the remaining years of my life. I |
fully appreciate that It Is a long struggle,
but the progress already made under the motto
of the Civic Federation â the golden rule â has
, surpassed even my most sanguine expectations, f
1 and 1 am sure that the American people wiil
i sustain a policy based upon the highest moral
and social impulse, which will eliminate the .
Passionate prejudices that new exist between '
eapital and labor. I
Discussing: some of the objects of
the Civic Federation Senator- Hanna \
says:
Until within a comparatively few years b!u
capitalists or the employing Interests have
had the advantage because there were mor.'
Â¦workmen than there was work. But condi
tions have changed, and for every workman,
on an averas-e, there are two Jobs now In the j
heyday of our prosperity, and ,it is expecting
too much of human nature to suppose that
workingmen shall not desire a larger share
of the profits.
MAKES STRONG APPEAL.
Labor organizations may be open to sharp
criticism at times, but It cannot be fairly
stated that they are always wrong. If every
man Is treated as a man and an appeal made
to his heart as well as his reason it wiil
establish a bond of confidence as a sure foun
dation to build upon. While labor unions may
have been a curse to Knglahd, I believe they
will prove a boon to our own country when
a -proper basis of confidence and respect Is
established.
The menace of to-day, as I view it. is the
spread of a spirit of socialism â one of those
things which Is only half understood and Is
more or l*ss used to Inflame the popular mind
agafnsl all individual .initiative and persona!
energy, which has been the very essenct of
American progress.
NO "ISMS" WANTED.
There is a spirit of co-operation or communi
ty of interests, which tome people may con
found with socialism, that is making headway
I with us; but when any one attempts for po
litical or financial reasons to advocate the
whol* programme of European socialism he
will find little prcspeet of the seeds taking root
in American soil. This. I think, was demon
strated very conclusively In. the Ohio cam
paign, . where higher socialism was brought
forth as an issue.
Fairness and prejudice will never agree
to the confiscation of the products of
one man's toll in order to Insure
comfort to the Idle and worthless. No
"Ism" Is wanted by the American people that
will take from any citizen the just and eqnlt
able reward of his labor. Both capital and la
bor must yield In time to the great law of
fair dealing, man to man. I wish I could im
press upon every American the Individual re
sponsibility that rests upon each one of us.
Every year of experience, every dollar of ac
cumulated capital, every talent we possess,
should be regarded as a sacred charge for the
good of the nation, to help in uniting the in
terests of rich and poor, learned and un
learned. . _
BOSTON, Jan. 22. â Senator Hanna
contributes to the February number of
the National Magazine of this city an
article pn "Socialism and the Labor
Unions."
After expressing his belief in the
power of education over the American
people and declaring that the basis of
right success is fairness and justice,
Senator Hanna writes: _ -
Justice Pritchard discharged the
rule issued yesterday against Post
offlce Inspectors Mayer and Gregory,
charged by the defense with coaching
witnesses, -being satisfied with their an
swers as contained in affidavits pre
sented by them. An adjournment un
til Monday was taken.
The disputed transcript of Machen's
account with the Union National Bank
of Westminster, Md., then was admit
ted on the express understanding that
only such items as were shown to relate
to Machen in the transactions between
him and the other defendants should
be considered.

tal trial to-day several witnesses were
led through a tedious line of question-

most of which, as counsel explained,
was for the purpose of showing a per

in the introduction of the Groff fasten
ers. The Government announced that
it was nearing the completion of its
case.
After counsel for the defense had
briefly touched on the statement made
at the close of yesterday's session by

of $3300 a year, had managed to make
$20,000 & year, Mr. Conrad secured per

â¢-
TO the Editor of the San Francisco
Â¦ -Call: Having discovered a new
rtmedy which I believe will revolution-
ize the practice of medicine. I must earn-
estly ask that you assist m? in Its intro-
duction by announcing a free distribu-
tion from a newspaper office.
I want the public to know the truth â
know it as I know it.
I believe there is a cure for every dis-
ease â I believe that human life can he
prolonged â I believe that people should
die only from old age, and \ also believe
and know that my Paw Paw remedy will
not only relieve much suffering, but add
many years to the average life.
In my opinion dyspepsia and indiges-
tion are the cause of most ailments. In-
digestion means nervousness, sleepless-
ness, impure blood, catarrh, sluggish
liver, kidney and heart affections. Nr>
person can be happy â no person can see
the beauties or life and enjoy its pleas-
ures, who suffers from any form of
stomach trouble.
An eminent actor called my attention
to the wonderful benefit he had derived
from eating the Paw Paw fruit, telling
me that it had made almost a new stom-
ach for him. I 'began to experiment
with this fruit and found it to be a most
powerful aid to digestion.
I have taken the medicinal qualities of
this fruit and combined it with othei
medicaments and have made a prepara-
tion which is called "MUNIOX'S PAW
PAW."
I cannot recommend this remedy too
highly for all- forms of indigestion and
nervousness. This remedy also acts
wonderfully well on the liver, blood and
kidneys, but I believe its greatest o{Bce
is in its marvelous effect upon the stom-
ach and nerves. It Is really a nerve food
and vitalizer.
It fiives exhilaration without intoxica-
tion. It does what whisky nor be-T can-
not do. It rcliex.es the nerve tension. It
stimulates every fiber and puts into act-
ive force every tissue of the body. It
lifts one into the altitude of hope and
holds him there. , It is a bridge that en-
ables the weak and sickly to cross dan-
gerous places. ? It feeds and nourishes
the nerves, so that the blood corpuscles
will be constantly revitalized, and thsÂ»
losses of the vital forces will be almost
imperceptible. In. other words, it wiil
supply a sufficient quantity of life mat-
ter to take the place of the waste.
Instead of irritating the nerves arid
stomach Â¦ it soothes and strengthens
them.
Almost every human being some tim<Â»
requires a stimulant. NOT AN ALCO-
HOLIC STIMULANT, not a stimulant
that will buoy him up for a moment and
then cast him down to lower depths of
depression, but a stimulant that will
give an abiding strength and lasting
force.
lly Paw Paw aids the stomach to di-
gest hearty foods, and to make good,
rich blood, which again in turn strength-
ens the nerves, vitalizing all the tissues,
and soon produces muscle; tissue, bone.
It is my opinion that tho clergymen In
this country could do no greater service
to the cause of temperance than to ad-
vocate the general use of my Paw Paw.
for by its . use drunkenness would bÂ»
lessened and the morals and health of
the community greatly improved.
A wife whose husband is addicted ;o
drinking can do nothing better for her-
self or family than to get a bottle of this
Paw Paw, and whenever her husband
feels the need of a tonic give him a ta-
blespoonful of Paw. Paw. She will find
that he will soon lose all cravings for
strong drinks â that his appetite will
soon become natural; that his nervous-
ness and longing for excitements wJli
disappear, and he will be perfectly satis-
f.ed without alcoholic stimulants and
harmful beverages.
I have so much confidence in this
rsmedy, that I propose distributing trial
bottles free from the leading newspaper
offices throughout the country. I want
everybody -to try it. feeling confident
that it will bring relief and happiness.
Trusting you will aid me in this In-
vestigation. I beff to remain.
Tours faithfully. ,

There is considerable speculation over tho

in the vicinity of Ramona. â¢ The, reports, are
many and. mostly exaggerated. Mr. Wilson of

spection qf tha "â¢Â¦various ledges and secured
specimens",. of the gems. After making - thor
ough tests of the stone in the company's lapi
dary "Wilson founcl , it to be the genuine white
topaz. The ledges are of a pejematyte forma
tion. Â¦ consisting of quartz. - feldspar and . mica.
Besides the' topaz are found zircon, garnet and
very good indications of tourmaline. The best
prospect discovered so far was by Mr. Booth
at the stage station four miles cast of Ramona.
Only white topaz. has so far .been found, but
if the gre*n and blue ' varieties ' can be . found
it will become the richest section of San Diego

SAN DIEGO, Jan. 22. â It was
learned to-day that Homer H. Peters
has undertaken to finance, 'under a
consolidation plan, the entire proper
ties of the four corpcyrations - known
as the Cheney holdings in San Diego
County and that it is contemplated to
re-establish the Sweetwater reservoir
so as to provide a liberal supply of
water both for irrigating and domes
tic use. It is also planned to electri
cize the National C/ty and Otay Rail
road and equip it with up-to-date cars
and extend the road to meet the
wishes of a large area in Chula Vista
territory.
The aggregate value of the Cheney
property is several' million dollars, it
includes the Sweetwater system: the
National City and Otay Railroad;
about 30.000 acres of land, including
1500 in orchards; also about '2200 lota
In San Dieso and 3700 in" National
City, besides an acid factory at Na
tional and various other properties,
both real and personal.

cerning the contemplated improve
ments he declined to enter into details.
SANTA ROSA RESIDENTS
FAVOR BONDING THE CITY
t -
3Ierchants and Financiers Discuss
With Councilmen Advisability of
Raising Improvement Funds.
SANTA ROSA. Jan. 22. â For some
time past the members of the Com
mon Council have been discussing the
advisability of bonding Santa Rosa to
secure municipal improvements. This
discussion crystallized last night at a
largely attended meeting of the Coun
cil, at which representative citizens of
Santa Rosa were present. Speeches
were made advocating the proposed
bond issue. The meeting then ad
journed until Saturday night, after de
termining the amounts to be: raised
for water and sewer purposes. For
the former $40,000 will be required,
and for the latter $25,000. On Satur
day evening the matter of providing
funds by bonding for street improve
ments and for a, municipal lighting
system will be determined. ' t
Among those who addressed the
Councilmen urging them to take ac
tion in the matter of the proposed
bonding: were merchants and finan
ciers, who believe that within five
years Santa Rose will double her pop
ulation.
Escnped Convict Eludes Pursuers.
. LOS ANGELES, Jan. 22. â Edward
Parker, the convict under sentence of
two years' imprisonment, who leaped
from a train in the Tehachapi Moun
tains while en route to the peniten
tiary, has succeeded in getting away.
Sheriff White and Deputy Cleveland
returned here, to-day and acknowledg
ed they had abandoned the chase.". A
close watch, -however, will be kept at
all avenues leading from the vicinity
and it is hoped that Parker may yet
be recaptured.
"The committee decided to continue
hearings during this session, and also
to meet frequently for the consideration
of river and harbor legislation and the
demands of such localities as are re
questing improvements. The necessity
for giving undivided attention to the
framing of the bill will prevent hear
ings at the next session."
'It is expected that the committee
will present a bill at a very early date
in the next session, certainly not later
than when Congress reconvenes after
the .holiday recess. In the meantime,
some legislation will be recommended
by the committee for' the necessary
maintenance of existing public works,
for such general legislation as may be
desired, and perhaps also for the ex
amination and survey of new projects.
"The main reason for this action was
the very large balance appropriation
for river and harbor improvements
which Is now lying in the Treasury,
unexpended. This balance at the end
of Â«last year was somewhat in excess
of S3S.000.000. In addition to this, it is
expected that $8,000,000, or thereabouts,
will be appropriated at this session in
the sundry civil bill for the continuance
of work on rivers and harbors where
improvements are progressing under
continuing contracts.
"A considerable number of com
plaints have been lodged with members
of the committee because of slowness
in prosecuting improvements. In some
cases appropriations were made several
years ago, but nothing yet has been
done. In others which were provided
for in the bill of June, 1902, the work
is scarcely commenced. The inade
quate number of Government engineers
engaged in this branch of the service,
the delay and difficulty in preparing
plans and securing sites for Govern
ment works and the high prices which
have prevailed for several years past,
are all, in different degrees, responsi-
Ble for this delay.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 22.â The House
Committee on Rivers and Harbors to
duy decided that there should be no
river and harbor appropriation bill at
the present session of Congress, al
though a few surveys may be author
ized. In explanation of the postpone-'
ment of a bill until next session. Chair
man Uurton made the following state
ment;

The auction sale of the Parnassus
Heights lots, held by Baldwin & How
ell on Thursday, attracted a large
crowd and the competition for the
lots was spirited from the opening of
*the sale.
This news was circulated about the
University Club yesterday. It was ar
gued by some of the graduates that
there was a moral obligation on the
University of California to take part
in the exposition, as the size of the
appropriation' as appears by the text
of the law adopted by the California
Legislature was based upon the prop
osition that all the State's institutions
would take part and so render unnec
essary a larger appropriation that was
finally approved of. The State Library,
the public schools and other branches
of public service have already provided
for co-operation.
Some graduates say that it would be
ridiculous for the university, after
making so strenuous a fight for lead
ing place at St. Louis, to fail to be rep
resented and acknowledge to the world
that the' only reason for failure was
that in the opulent State of California,
that boasts justly of its wealth and re
sources, the principal public institu
tion of learning should take the back
track publicly and be. subjected to ridi
cule because of the Jack of only $5000.
It is possible that a committee of
graduates of the State University will
be appointed to devise means to
raise the amount necessary to insure
a worthy exhibit by the university at
the exposition.
GRADUATES TAKE XCTIOX.
Yesterday it was rumored on the
street that the California Commission
ers to St. Louis had, since the meeting
of the Board of Regents of the State
University, also turned down an appli
cation for an appropriation of $5000.
This on investigation was found to be
true. In Berkeley, where the corre
spondence that has passed is kept on
file, it was learned' that President
Wheeler wrote to the Commissioners
and in his letter gave information that
the commission was the only source
through which money might be pro
cured for the much desired university
show at St. Louis. As soon as possible
thereafter an answer, signed by Com
missioner J. A. Filcher, was received
from the California Commissioners.
In his letter Commissioner Filcher
said that he was compelled to deny the
university's request, although person
ally he desired that the work of the
great institution of learning should be
placed in evidence, at St. Louis before
the millions of spectators that will be
in attendance during the exposition
season. Butâ and the denial hinged on
that "but"â the money that was ap
propriated by the State, amounting to
$130,000, was all apportioned, and there
was no chance for any revision.
COMMISSIONERS REFUSE.
Graduates of the. University of Cali
fornia may take concerted action to
provide,' the necessary funds to have
the University, of .California represent
ed adequately aiNthe St. Louis;Exposi
tion. Such is the ; talk about 'the Uni
versity Club, and a movement to help
the university may take form directly
in that quarter. .There are thousands
of .students that owe their education
and success to the State institution at
Berkeley. They are chagrined at the
present attitude the university, by
force of circumstances, is compelled to
occupy: J A petition to the authorities
having in charge the â¢ distribution of
university space in the Education
building at St. Louis met with a favor
able response after some time and la
bor^ had. been devoted to deliberation
at St. Louis. A corner has been set
apart inthe Education building for the
University of California, and the uni
versity has accepted the offer of the
location assigned. .
Now the university has no money
with which to provide an exhibit. The
Board of Regents of the university re
cently denied an application for an ap
propriation of 55000 to provide for get
ting up the university exhibit. The
reason given was that the large short
age in the university funds occasioned
by the defalcation of Secretary Mc-
Kowen had left the institution without
ready money to pay for anything ex
cept absolutely unavoidable expenses.
Tl. G. Dun & Co.'s Weekly Review of
Trade to-morrow will say: Weather
conditions have furnished the chief in
fluences in the general trade situation.
To some extent traffic has been hin
dered, especially at the Kast, but the
latest returns of railway earnings for
January show an increase of 4.9 per
tent over 1903. Wholesale business is
fairly active, traveling salesmen send
ing in about average orders, and jobbing
trade is normal. Manufacturing plants
are more active, with little change in
quotations, and the outlook for spring
trade is considered favorable. Collec
tions are somewhat more prompt.
Leading staples have risen to new
maximum prices for the crop year.
Iron and steel plants that resumed at
the turn of the year have obtained
sufficient business to continue oper
ating and thus far the adjustment of
wages has not produced the threatened
strike. Increased activity and strength
is reported in the domestic hide market.
Failures this week numbered 358 in
the United States, against 265 last year,
and 33 in Canada, compared with 27
a year ago.
Wheat, including: flour, exports for
the week ending January 21 aggregate,
r.23?.lo2 bushels, against 2,771.210 last
nreCk and S,-3S,737 this week last year.
Business failures in the Unite*! States
numbered 2CC, against 315 last week and
253 in the like week in lfÂ«03. In Canada
the failures Dumber 25, against 39 last
week and 22 last year.
The Iron trace is irregular as a whole
and variously regarded, optimistically
or the reverse, according as the point
cf view shifts from crude to finished
jroducts or the obverse is located Kast
or West. Among the other metals **op
per and. tin are lower, while lead is
higher. Lumber and building materials
arc naturally rather up at present,
Â¦when outdoor work is at a minimum,

as promising.

NEW POINT OF VIEW.
The Mother Lode Banner editorially
says: \
He who has gold to se|l may not add one iota
U- Us value to get even on increased expenses,
nor can he cut his price in an effort -. to ' de
stroy competition. The price of gold; is abso
lutely fixed ami all calculations must stand on
this figure, therefore every increase , in ; cost of
production comes out: of the profits. In gold
mining tho , percentage of dividend payers is
email and if none but paying mines .were
worked thousands of miners would ; be ' com
pelled to turn to other , branches of industry.
Investors in sold mlnlnK . expend thousands of
dollars in machinery and labor,, all on a pros
pect of future returns, and miners,- ' by op
pressive demands, may embarrass managers
' The mines that are combined are the Pioncer-
Iilaclc Oak 'group, tiow< embracing ten claims
and eighty acres of timber; land; the Trinity
Consolidated, with ten-stamp mill and equip
mentâthis property embraces six claims; the
Bacchus mine of two claims; the: Laconla.
comprising three claims, and the - RICkard
with .'. tw<j claims. The" Delta mine, with two
claims and- a two-stamp mill, and several
claims - belonging to Messrs. Sanderg and
HveemÂ» will sin all probability be included
when' the' titles have been perfected. In all,
over tftlrty claims are embraced in the con
solidation and nearly CCOO feet of work has
been pi-formed on eight or ten parallel veins.
The most extensive work has been done on
the Pioneer- Black Oak mine. _ Â»
Amador City is thriving. / The Key
stone mine is^ reported to be the lead
ing cause. A large amount of ore has
been blocked out and the mine plant
will be remodeled. Something has been
done in this line. The*' Amador Ledger
reports that the skips have been re
placed with appliances of larger capa
city.. New receivers for compressed air
will be. Installed. A new pump, able to
lift 70,000 gallons every nine hours,
has been added. Continuing, the Ledger
says:
. The Redding Free Press reports that
the. mining 1 district' west 'of "Djelta is
about to be developed largely. All the
properties o,f the "South, Fork, so M. E.
Ditmar tells the Free- Press, have been
consolidated in one ' ownership. The
Press says: V. ''.''.
LARGE CONSOLIDATIONS
If at the annual meeting the stockholders
do rot arrange to settle the bills the lien
holders will immediately proceed to foreclose.
Mr. Baldwin granted an extension of time
for the company to pay the balance due on
the Potosi-Orleans. This property and the
Federal Loan are operated by a different cor
poration from that of the Gold Tunnel, al
though many of the same people are Interested
in all three. The Orleans and Federal I-ioan
claims will be settled by next Wednesday,
states Mr. Vick, and the company will then
proceed to resume operations at both mines.
The debts against the Erie mine near Granlte
ville are comparattvejy small .and those who
have money coming will - undoubtedly receive
what As due tlienv'as most' of the bills were
settled about a month ago. â¢;' â¢' â¢ % .
In addition to the above sections good quartz
properties are found on Eastmans Gulch. Junc
tion City, Indian Creek, Hay Fork and Hyam
jiom, tlie steady development of which Is show
ing up large bodies of dividend paying ore.
As an illustration of our older and productive
mines we will take the Enterprise mine on
the East Fork of the North Fork. The mine
consists of thirteen full claims containing 323
acres of mineral and timber land, with ample
water power appurtenant to run 100 stamps
for the greater portion of the year. From.thls
property over $500,000 has been taken in 'the
past, notwithstanding the fact that the ealier
owners were hampered by lack of capital to
properly open up and work the mine. As yet
the main work has been done on the Enter
prise and I^one Jack claims, leaving the other
eleven practically virgin territory.
In conclusion the assertion is' made
by the Journal that Trinity County
has produced $200,000,000 in minerals,
and that far greater values are in the
ledges and soil than, have been taken
out, concluding with > the following
statement: "The county contains more
than. 100,000 acres of .mineral land bear
ing ground, a large portion of which is
unprospected." /
According to the Grass Valley Union,
the affairs of the Gold Tunnel mine are
unsettled. The Union says that it is
probable that the claims against the
Pc-tosi-Orleans and Federal Loan mines
will be paid soon, while the Gold Tun
nel claims are doubtful. A meeting
recently was held and, according to
the Union, Mr. Vick, who represented
thp Eastern stockholders, asked the
miners not to press their liens until
after the 26th inst., when a meeting of
the stockholders will be held in New
York. While the matter is left open
the duiuds at the Gold Tunnel mine
will be kept running. Continuing, the
Union savs:
SOME OTHER MIXES.
The quartz mines of the county follow the
Trinity River from it? head nnd that of its
tributaries to its mouth. The whole water
shed of the river is traversed with paying
ledges and ribbed with auriferous quartz. The
ore lor the in</st part is free milling, with
Concentrates easily reduced, and differs, in
the widely distributed mining: camps, chici.y
in eold vulues i>er ton.
At the head of Coffee Creek the Dorleska
produces betweon $20,nOO and ?.J0.000 a month.
The Yellow Kose of Texas adjoining carries
one of the largest, richest and best denned
ore bodies in the State. At Minersville the
Fair View, thoroughly equipped. Is steadily
crushing rich rock and yielding handsome re
turns. At Carrville the Strode has yielded sev
eral hundred thousand dollars and is atill
working the same pay chute.
At liullychcop the Bullychoop mines are
equipped with mills and a gravity tramway
and carry an Immense ore body. They are
worked at a lfcinimuin of expense and return
handsome profits to the company.
At Deadv.ood the Brown Bear group has
yielded over $10,000,000 and has years of use
fulness bofore it. The J^appln mine adjoining
has shown up a hp.ndsome body of ere.
On the East Fcrk of the North Fork of the
Trinity the Enterprise group of mines, with a
record of an output of over $500,000. and the
Yellowstone *roup. with its splendid record
us a producer, sland first. On the mineral
ised belt between Kast Fork and New River
BrÂ« Golden Chest. Bob's Farm and Schwartz
mines, carrying high values.
At the latter place the Toushnut has yielded
many thousand <lollavs and its crushing ca
pacity !.<= hoir.g stendily' increased.
T):Â» Sherwood adjoining has yielded hand
somely during tho past season. On" Cannon
Crerk the Chloride-Bailey, with thirty claims
r.iuipped with every scientific appliance, in
cluding- two mills dropping thirty stamps and
a chlorfnation plant. Is second in reputation
only to the Brown Bear. The Globe adjoining:,
thoroughly equipped, ranks as one of the best
mines In the State. In their vicinity the de
velopment work on the Mason & Thayer group
and th? Ralston -nines have proven these prop
erties of merit.-
Much attention has been attracted
to the mining interests of Trinity
County by some Judicious publications
of facts. The mining counties t are
awakenins to the idea that, no matter
how good their mines are, it is neces
sary to call attention to them that
outsiders with capital to invest may
be interested. The Trinity Journal has
performed a good service for the ec-un
ty in which it thrives by giving, in
connection with <a history of Trinity
mining, certain informaton that is of
interest. Among the leading statements
are the following:

Until quite recently one of the
smallest and most woeful of the hulks
at Bonny was all that was left of a
vessel which in her prime was one of
the most popular ships sailing from
New York in the trans-Atlantic trade.
She was the old Adriatic of the Col
lins line. . .' â¢ â¢
The Adriatic was for years very
popular with passengers as- one of the
best and most comfortable boats on
the line, and many a traveler would
book no other .vessel, preferring to
wait until the sailing day of the Adri
atic came' around. After the service
was withdrawn the Adriatic became
one of a new line of vessels, with-Gal
ivay,: Ireland,' as the home port.
This venture was not successful, and
after the Adriatic had been laid up at
Birkenhead for a number of years and
was about to be knocked to pieces for
old iron, she- was finally bought for a
song and taken to Bonny as one of the
storage hulks^for the? African Steam
ship .Company of London. '
The/day^ came at last when the old
vessel was ; worthless 'even 'for storage
purposes.* She would scarcely hang to
getherv'and the work - of pumping her
out had become, too arduous; so (She
was towed up the river a; little. way,'
her'nose was poked into a swamp and
there she was left to fall; to pieces at
her >leisure.-âNew; York Sun.
In the deck-houses are the quarters
of the agents of European trading
companies which barter goods with
the natives tor these articles. When
steamers come into the ports they tie
up to the hulks and load with the ac
cumulated freight.
One of the most important of these
ports is .Bonny, on a branch of the
Niger delta. It has long been devoted
to legitimate trade, but was once the
most frequented station of the slavers.
As many as 320,000 captives were sold
in the market of Bonny in the first
twenty years of the nineteenth cen
tury, , Bonny is to-day one - of the
greatest markets for palm oil, and 20,
000 tons are'sometimes shipped to Eu
rope in a year.
Worn out and dilapidated, their
years of sea service ended, they are
moored near the- mouths of rivers, in
side the bar, and take the places of
warehouses. The palm oil, palm ker
nels, groundnuts, rubber, ivory and
other commodities â¢ which those re
gions have to sell are stored on board
these old vessels.
. If you were to visit some of the
ports on. the coast of West Africa
which are not yet provided with docks
and other facilities for shipping, you
would \ see the hulks of many steam
ers, some of them formerly7 well
known -in New York harbor, that in
the day of their decline are playing a
very humble role.

Beach came across two hoboes en
camped a mile southeast of Woodburn.
They had just exchanged their old
clothing for new suits, which the Mar

goods.
At first the thieves mistook the officer
for tho farmer who owned the place,
but when he attempted to place them
under arrest they attacked him, threw
him down, took his revolver away and
were choking him when the approach
of a rancher caused them to desist and
hurry off. The Marshal made a stub
born fight while on his "bacHc, kicking
one of his assailants several times and
leaving finger-nail marks on the face
of the other, who was on top and chok
ing him. When the news of the as

was organized and started in search of
the thieves, but they could not be found
on account of the darkness, and this
morning the Marshal, notwithstanding
that he was badly used up, started forth
with a new posse, word having been
brought in by children that the robbers
had been seen east of here.

. TRAMPS WHO BEAT MARSHAL
PENDLETON, Or., Jan. 22. â The
failure of C. B. Wade, formerly cash
ier of the First National Bank, whose
liabilities are some $500,000. is taking
on a sensational form. Creditors have*"
petitioned; the Federal Court at Port
land to declare Wade a bankrupt. On
the arrival! of a deputy marshal here
to serve; the papers Mrs. Wade, for
merly president of the Federation of
Women's Clubs, announced that her
husband [would leave at once for Eu
rope in search of health. In view of
recent disclosures it would seem that
this trip .may also obviate Wade's ar
rest on serious charges.
Wade .was administrator of a num
ber of estates and $14,036 is said to
be missing from that of Charles Craig,
deceased. Twenty widows and orphans
are pressing for an accounting- of
funds aggregating $65,000, which
Wade held, as trustee. An illiterate
stockman thought he had $50,000 on
deposit, but finds that the bank's books
show him' owing the bank $7000 on a
note which: he says he never signed.
All these things have turned the tide
of public , feeling strongly against
Wade, who at first was believed to
have erred only in judgment.
Charges Are Made That Estates of
Which He was Administrator Are
in a Muddled Condition.
FAILURE OF BANKER WADE
IS TAKING A SERIOUS TURN
"I have always contended and have
long worked toward proving the claim
that Alaska can produce almost any
thing if the proper farming methods
are applied. At my place In Sitka we
raise all kinds of vegetables, and this
year we enjoyed a splendid crop of
potatoes, of which I think I gathered
nearly 300 bushels. Farther north you
find rich lands for grazing purposes,
and under proper treatment I am cer
tain that all kinds of vegetation can
be cultivated.
"On Â¦ the Â¦ Seward peninsula there are
large areas where grass grows In re
markable abundance. Strangely, while
this is yearly going to waste we are
importing hundreds of tons of meat for
consumption among the people of the
Territory.
"Alaska Is a great expanse of land,
rich in varied resources but-lacking. In
population. If we can convince .people
that we are able to produce necessary
commodities for general consumpt : cn
we will have no trouble in populating
the Territory and. building up a gov
ernment that ;the United ' States may
be rightfully proud of."
The- Governor stated that better
roads are needed in the Territory." but
Governor Brady is enthusiastic over
the agricultural display the Territory
expects to make at the exposition. He
is an experienced fttrmer and during
his many years' residence in Alaska
has made a close study of the agricul
tural possibilities of that country, and
expresses great confidence in its future
ability to produce its own hay and
grain and ample quantities of vege
tables for consumption throughout the
entire Territory. He rejects - with : a
grea't deal of earnestness the conten
tions made by the Senatorial Commis
sion, that recently visited the Terri
tory, that its soil is not adaptive to ag
ricultural purposes.
"To me nothing in Alaska appears
more promising than the agricultural
possibilities, " said the Governor, "and
I think I have a right to differ with
the Senators, for I know more about
the country. They did not pay a visit
to the valleys of the Copper River, the
Tanana and the Kus-Ko-Kv.'lm, nor
penetrate the Kenai nor the Seward
peninsulas, where agricultural possi
bilities have been demonstrated by va
rious methods of farming. We hope
to show our agricultural products . to
advantage. Our exhibit will include
grain, fruits, -berries of a native qual
ity, beets, turnips and cauliflowers
MORE POPULATION" NEEDED.
AGRICULTURAL PROSPECTS.
"I regret to say that we are some
what behind in our display of furs and
fishes â a. fact that may, in a measure,
be attributed to differences that arose
over the question of commissionerships
for these particular departments, but
the matter has finally been straight
ened out and we hope to Improve these
displays. While in Seattle I conferred
with a^ number of the representatives
of the concerns that are engaged in
fishing in Alaskan waters and received
from them assurance of assistance in
making the fish exhibit a good one.
Most of last year's furs have already
been shipped to London, and it is pos
sible that those that are being taken
now may arrive at the exposition a lit
tle late."
John G. Brady, Governor of the Ter
ritory of Alaska, arrived from the north
yesterday and is registered at the Pal
ace Hotel. He has come south to con
fer with Mrs. Mary E. Hart of Nome,
who has been appointed lady, manager
of the Alaskan exhibit at the St. Louis
Exposition, and who, as secretary of
the Alaskan Academy of Sciences, has
done much toward aiding the territo
rial residents in perfecting their plans
for a representative display.
"I am satisfied that Alaska will make
a very creditable display at St. Louis,"
remarked Governor Brady. "We. have
a notable mineral collection to exhibit.
It is being prepared by J. G. r^avis of
Juneau, and will include, in addition
to a care- full j' selected lot* of ores, an
interesting model of ! the famotfs.
Treadwell mine, showing the interior
workings of that property, especially
its excavations up to the present time.
"Our wonderful copper and tin de-'
posits and anthracite coals and the
products of our rapidly developing oil
districts will also be represented in
Alaska's exhibit in a manner that is
bound to attract attention. We have
already shipped a large quantity of
ore specimens in boxes to St. Louis,
and our agents are now collecting
quartz .samples from Prince of Wales
Island.

â¢ant Armstrong, who murdered Minnie
Knsmingcr near llaines, in this roumy,
on Christinas morning, 1902. was exe
cuted in the jail yard here this morn
1 ins. His r.Â«?ck was broken by the fall.
'3"he execution was perfect as to de
Â¦ tail. Armstrong maintained his iron
nerve until the last. He made a brief
fd'lrr'ss to the assembled crowd, say
ing that he was sorry for his crime,
Â¦but that he v.-as to meet his
victim.
â¢ At the close of his address Arm-

(n-t&w, Joseph Henner, near Haines.
Or., on Christmas night, 1902. Miss
Unrminper had broken her engage
ment with Armstrong, who sought her j
life in revenge.
SHERIFF FOOLS LVNTHEHS.
At the conclusion of a dance, which
vaÂ« held at the ranch. Miss Ensminger,
in company with others of the party. |
started from the house to the barn- ]
yard. v. here the t earns had been left-.;
Armstrong was lying in trait, and when j
the girl rassed him ho dre'.v a re- |
- volver and shot her twice. He then;
turned thÂ»Â» weapon upon himself and j
f red. the bullet grazing his forehead, j
Ftunninj? him temporarily. The male !
nieoihers of the party immediately j
prized Armstrong and prepared to j
. . lynch him. Tho Sheriff had in the
r?cantime been summoned and arrived
en th** scene l>ofore ihe lynching could
take place. Armstrong's captors were
persuaded to surrender their prisoner
under the plea that it would be wise to
defer hanging him until after the death j
â¢<.f Miss Ensmingrer. the Sheriff hold-!
ir.sr out hone that the young woman
would survive her injuries. Miss Ens
minger died the following morning.
Anr.strors was convicted of murder
in the first degree and sentenced to be
hanged the following May, under a law
then in existence, which provided that
hangings should be conducted by the j
* Sheriff of the county in which the
< rime was committed. A few days
} rior to the date set for the hanging a
new law w^nt into effect providing that
hangings should take j>l?jee at the
State penitentiary, under the* direction
of the Warden.
MAKES HARD FIGHT FOR LIFE.
After his conviction, Armstrong's at
torneys appealed the case in the Su
preme Court, and a stay of execution
: was granted, pending a determination
of the question involved, by that
tribunal. The Supreme Court affirmed
the cape and the date for the execution
Â¦was reret for January 22, 1001. Arm
strong's attorneys -immediately at
tacked th*Â» validity of the death war
- rant, contending that Armstrong was
u rider sentence to be hanged by an
â¢ Â¦flicial. who, under the new lav.-,* was
lacking authority, and appealed to th*
Supreme Court. Before the Supreme
<"urt could hoar the case, the Legisla
ture, In extraordinary session, amended
thr- new law so as to provide for the
hancing of condemned murderers pen
t*nced during the life of the old law.
Ab the date for ihe execution drew
n^ar Armstrongs attorneys applied for
nnd were refused a stay of execution by
â¢ the Supreme Court. An appeal to the
Federal District Court on the same
grounds resulted in a ruling that as
it was only contended that the place
nnd executing officer had been changed
by the new law, the rights of the con
demned man had not in any way been
affected. The State Supreme Court, on
Thursday, rendered Its decision to the
effect that the death warrant was valid
and that the law should take its course.
It is announced that the loss to the
stockholders of the company by reason
of the failure will be in the neighbor
hood of $200,000. O. R. Stratton, a
prominent local capitalist, is said to
be the financial head of the concern,
but other local men are interested with
him. It is= also stated that the com

EUREKA, Jan. 22. â A daring holdup
occurred at Eugene Emerson's sa
loon, about a quarter of a mile outside
of Scotia,~ the headquarters of the Pa
cific Lumber Company. Two thugs,
with red handkerchiefs tied over their
faces and each carrying a revolver^
walked into, the saloon Wednesday'
night; and "lined up" twenty-five pa
trons of; the resort. While one of the
robbers covered the victims with his
revolver the other went through their
pockets. . About 5225 was secured from
them and 525 from the saloon till. To
insure their safe retreat, the robbers
compelled /the men to "bunch up," as
they termed it, and, with hands in the
air, precede them out of the saloon and
down the railroad track for a distance
of 100 yards. Then the victims were
halted and faced about and told to go
quietly up the track toward Scotia,
with the threat that if any of them
made an outcry or a false move bullets
would be sent speeding after them.
"You may.go your way and we will go
ours," said one of the robbers, and with
that the desperadoes and their victims
separated.
The Sheriff's office was notified and
Under Sheriff Terrill is working on the
case. . â¢

On the day of the alleged suicide
Coroner Smith was called and found
the woman dead,- with rope marks
around her neck, indicating that she
had been strangled. The family told
the Coroner that the^body had been
found In the cellar by her son. Wil

rope. But on investigation it was found
that there were no signs of congestion
such as always accompany strangula

the organs of the body to be in normal
condition. Nobody outside of father
and son reports to have seen the body
in the cellar of the house. The son is
the only one who says he saw his
mother suspended by the rope. HÂ«

the cellar and to have cut the body
down. He then called his father. Cor

Mr. Walsh said to-day that the epi
sode had not been dropped, which is
taken to mean that something else is in
the air. There is, however, only the
unsupported evidence of Walsh that
there was bribery attempted, and he is
not willing to swear that Pickett took
the money he says Fisher tendered, so
the chances for the prosecution are
slim.
Another controversy was indulged in
between the opposing counsel in the
case this morning. It was precipitated
by Walsh's request to reopen the ex
amination of C. B. Gage, who had al
ready been accepted as a juror. The
ground for the request was the alleged
bias cf the juror. After a squabble
that occuDied most of the morning ses
sion the attorneys compromised by per
mitting Walsh to excuse Gage on a
peremptory challenge. Ten Jurors have
been secured. The case will go on to
morrow.
Nothing was said about yesterday's
sensational charges when the case of
"Sam" Fisher, the West Berkeley sa
loon-keeper, charged with disturbing
the peace of E. E. Newton, was re
sumed this morning in Justice Edgar's
court. This silence as to the accusa
tions of Philip M. Walsh, the Deputy
District Attorney, that Fisher at
tempted to bribe Deputy Marshal
Pickett, leaves it to be inferred that
Justice Edgar does not intend to take
any further steps in the matter. But
it is understood that the District At
torney's office will call it to the atten
tion of the Grand Jury.

"Had he come to the spot where this
church now stands, the Bishop would
have found a \ veritable field ; populated
only with the':oaks ; . from>- which .this
city, takes its name. ' Some time before

had resulted in the building: erf Grace
Church, and, strange as it ,"* may seem
now, it was erected opposite

"After an eventful voyage, down the
Atlantic coast he crossed the isthmus
of. Panama and tookthe steamer Gold
en Gate for San Francisco. He reached
San Diego after the wreck of the Gold
en Gate, and taking another steamer
he reached San Francisco on Sunday,
January 29, and was met at the land
ing by Augustine W. Hale ' and a
Mr. Thompson and was taken" to the
home of the:latter, and less than three
hours' after leaving the ship he con
ducted his" first Sunday morning ser
vice at Trinity Church, then situated
where the Pine-street market now
stands. Sj ' vv.V
"Strangely enough shortly after
ward he did receive a call to the rec
torship of Trinity Churclv in : San
Francisco, which he determined to ac
cept. Immediately afterward he re
ceived a call from St. Peter's Church
in Baltimore. He went to Baltimore
and called upon the Bishop of that
diocese, to whom he . told his deter
mination to go to California. The
Bishop said: 'I have it. You should
go, not as the Rector of Trinity
Church, but as the Bishop of Califor
nia,' and at the general convention at
New York In 1853 Mr. Kip was nomlÂ«
nated and elected Bishop of Califor

CALLED TO WEST.
OAKLAND, Jan. 22. â The Episco
pal churches of Oakland united this
evening in a memorial service at St.
Paul's Church to commemorate the
fiftieth anniversary of the arrival of
the late Bishop Kip in San Francisco.
It was half a century ago that the di
vine landed upon these then unsettled
shores and the churches of Oakland
decided that to-night they would hold
services that would do honor to that
event. The Right Rev. Bishop Nich
ols was Dresent and delivered .the ad
dress of the evening, while the various
Oakland rectors participated in the
services. Those who took part were
Rev. C., T. Walkley of St. Paul's
Church, Rev. Edgar F. Gee of St.
John's Church, Rev. Clifton Macon of
Trinity Church, Rev. William Carson
Shaw of the Church of the Advent,
Rev. James Hulme of St. Paul's
Church and Rev. O. Scott of St. An
drew's Church.
Bishop Nichols delivered the ad
dress of the evening from the- topic,
"The Call of Bishop Kip to California
and the Field that He Found Here."
During his address Bishop Nichols
said:
"The thoughts of Bishop Kip, then
the Rev. Mr. Kip. were first turned
to California through the correspond
ence of Mr. Augustine W. Hale, a
brother-in-law of Mr. Kip's family
physician. In the meantime a call to
California had been extended to an
other clergyman in the East, who was
hesitating as to whether or; not he
would accept. While discussing this
call at the home of his physician one
day Mr. Kip was asked by the doc
tor's wife, 'Why don't you go to Cali
fornia?' and he said that should a call
be extended to him he would accept.

HIS Broadway, Jan, 22.
LETS BRIBERY
CHARGE REST
In this letter Mr. Friend reminded
President Wheeler of that glorious
time in 1S96 when the whole student
body answered the summons to build
the path that now leads from Center
street entrance to North Hall. They
turned out, all of them, and laid the
path in four days' time. It was a hard
job, but those intellectual laborers
stayed with it. There were blisters and
backaches and bruises, but the result
was worth all of them.
Nov/ Mr. Friend wants to see Stu
dent Labor Day done over again. He
thinks it ought to be made an annual
institution, forming a precedent for all
ether colleges. President W r heeler
thinks so, too, and that Is why he re
tailed Mr. Friend's suggestipns to-day
to Max Thelen, president cf the As
sociated Students, and i~ J. E. Road
houre, who promised to take them up
with the student body.
There is a good deal that a btudent
Labor Day could accomplish just now
In the way of improvements on the
campas. Most Important, of course, is
the p-oposed football field, for which
an inrr.ense lot of grading is necessary.
It will be expensive if done by a con
tractor and inexpensive if done by stu
dent labor. In three or four days the
students could save probably $5000 by
performing a portion oÂ£ the work.
The co-eds are to have a share in
the" n-ork if it is undertaken. Jhey will
r;t only be expected to look pleasant,
but to serve the workers with lunches
while they are toiling their young lives
away.
' Student Labor Day, that one day in
the year when a thousand, more or
less, brawny students roll up their,
sleeves and heave with the pick and
shovel, is about to be revived at the
University of California. It has been
in a mummified state now since the
last leap year eight years ago, but was
prodded into life again to-day by the
Rev. William Nat Friend of Golden,
Colorado, an alumnus of the univer
sity, who wrote a letter to President
Wheeler.

EVENTS IN SOCIETY
Leaves Instructions Also as
to How He Desires That His
Epitaph- Should Be Worded
ALA1IEDA. Jan. 22.â Bruno K.
Funke, politician, money broker, bar
ber and philosopher, prepared his own
funeral oration, and, in accordance with
his dying request, the oration was de
livered to-day by his old friend. Judge
R. B. Tappan, as Funke's body -was
about to be consigned to the flames at
the Oakland Crematory. The details
connected with the final disposition of
the body of the deceased had been per
fected by him when he realized that
his hours were numbered. He stipu
lated who should officiate as pallbear
ers and mourners, and arranged that
every hack driver should receive a
package of tobacco, two cigars and a
silver dollar. In compliance with an
other wish of the dead philosopher, the
mourners assembled in Oakland after
the incineration and partook of a din
ner, one vacant chair and an empty
glass being stationed at the head of
the table. The only toast offered was
to the dtnarted.
In the course of the eulogy Judge
Tappan said: "Having met my friend,
Mr. Bruno K. Funke, almost daily far
many years, I am in a position to say
that he was an intellectual man and
a loving son. \ He desired to live, as
he told me a few days ago, for just
five years more, not for his own but
for his mother's sake. In his dealings
with his clients and customers he was
straightforward and honest and never
exacted a cent more than his contracts
called, for. When they desired his
money in urgent cases all that he asked
of them was that they live up to their
contract. He had a keen mind that
was constantly in action digesting the
writings of the masters. During the
last of his life he discussed religious
matters and studied the Bible constant
ly. He never urged any one to accept
his belief. He said he could not ac
cept the Bible as the word of God and
have an orthodox minister speak of the
immortality of his soul .after he had
passed out. He asserted that he could
not embrace a reliclon that was not
in touch with reason. He could not
believe that it was necessary that a
whale should swim along in the water
and swallow Jonah; because- he;consid
ered that an all wise Providence could
attain the desired results with means
less absurd." " ! *>U3ti*'Â»iailÂ»V-Â«x <: Â»
His epitaph was. another matter that
Philosopher Funke did not .overlook.
He expressed to his friends that the
common phrase, "Gone to rest," was
objectionable to him, and he wanted his
epitaph to read. "Gone with the rest."

Thomas D. O'Brien is having trouble
with his mother-in-law. His wife is
dead and three little children survive
her. O'Brien claimed, before Judge
Fritz yesterday, that the custody of the
children by his mother-in-law was dis
tasteful to him and he refused to con
tribute to their support. The mother
in-law was in evidence, bearing trhe
name of Catherine Dobrogoishl. She
told of the care she lavished on the lit
tle ones in such a strenuous manner
that the Judge remained unimpressed.
Still the children were entitled to sup
port, and an order was made that
O'Brien would have, to pay $8 weekly
for their support. As he earns $21 a
week, this willnot be a great hardship
on him, despite the fact that he has a
mother-in-law.
A junk-dealer named B. *Axelard,
who docs business on Third street,

readily f purchased copper castings
from them, which they stole from the
Western Brass Foundry.

Policeman Ruggles early yesterday
morning that he had been held up by
four well dressed young men in front
of 710 Market street. One of them,
he said, had pointed a revolver at his
head and told him to keep quiet, while
another went through his pockets,
taking $30 in gold and silver coin.
Tiien warning him not to mako an
outcry, they ran down Third street.
Ilugrgrles visited several saloons on
Third street, accompanied by Murphy,
in the hope of finding the footpads,
and in the saloon* at 93 Third street
Murphy pointed out Charles King aÂ£
one of the men who had robbed him.
King was' arrested and .booked at the
City Prison on a charge of robbery.
Ruggles and Murphy continued their
search, but were unable to find any
trace of the other three. Murphy,
who was under the influence of liquor,
was detained as a witness. , %

Benjamin Michaels was held in $6000
bail to answer to the Superior Court
yesterday by Judge Fritz, on the
charge of grand larceny by trick and
device. He is one of the two defend
ants arrested on an alleged charge of
bunkoing Wade W. Copenhaven out
of $1500. Ap narrated by Copenhaven,
who once occupied the honorable posi
tion of an Oregon farmer, the scheme
was to create, out of his crude metal,
a manager of a theatrical troupe. He
had visions of a diamond studded shirt
front and the regard of every blonde
beauty who wished an engagement.
It took some time for Michaels to re
lieve the crafty farmer of. his coin.
There was real estate to be transferred
and various objections were made by
Copenhaven to parting with the wad
of green governmental promises which
the Treasury Department issues.
Finally he was separated from his roll
through the instrumentality of a man
named Stanton, on whom the police
have no line. Stanton, is still wanted
to clear up the peculiar v case.
William Harvey, a codefendant of
Michaels, was discharged because there
was no further testimony against him
than that his photograph, in four dif
ferent poses, was In tÂ£e possession of
the Police Department, and tha^t he
was generally rated as a bunko man
who had mixed some with Michaels in
the alleged stripping ot Copenhaven.

Attorney W. W. Foote objected and
insisted upon the case going to $rial
because the prosecution had not made
a sufficient showing for a continuance.
The Judge heard evidence as to the
woman's having been admonished to
be in court when the case was called
for trial and as to the inability of the
police to locate her, and then de
cided to discharge the jury and grant
a continuance till January 30.

WILL PITT NEW COURSE OF
DRAWING INTO EFFECT
Superintendent Langdon Greatly Sim
plifies the Study on Recommenda
tion of Principals of Schools.-
Superintendent of. Schools Langdon
yesterday completed the new course
of drawing which he was empowered
to do by resolution of the Board of
Education. The new course is greatly
simplified and has been so. reduced as
to make it much less burdensome than
the old, and Is founded on recommen
dations made by principals and teach
ers.
Miss Katherine Ball, supervisor of
drawing,, was shown the course by
tangdon, who explained to her its
details. Langdqh ysaid It was desired
to^ prevent in future, any controversy
among principals* and ' teachers which
had resulted In disagreement some
months ago and threatened to disrupt
the School. Department.
Miss Ball expressed herself as sat
isfied with thecpurse. and will carry
out its provisions.. Her powers have
not been changed In any way, and she
will continue supervising-' the study
with -the assistance ."'off* Miss Murray.
The salaries of both teachers will be
left undisturbed. ..',:Â¦'
The taking of depositions in the case
of Hannah E. Nelson and others vs.
Theresa Alice Oelrichs and others, the
object of which is to set aside the
agreement entered Into between the
heirs of Mr. and Mrs. Charles L. Fair,
was resumed before Ccrurt Commis
sioner John A. Hosmer yesterday after
noon in the presence of attorneys rep
resenting both sides to the controversy.
James W. Bollen, who Is employed
by 'the undertaking firm of Porter &
White, took the stand. He testified
that he was' employed by Porter &
White in September, 1902, and that he
knew both Charles L. Fair and Mrs.
Caroline D. Fair by sight, but was not
personally acquainted with either of
them. Under the direction 'of Samuel
A.. White, he assisted in receiving the
bodies and caring for them. The re
mains arrived here in a private Pull
man car in charge of a porter.
The course of the coffins from Oak
land mole to the undertaking parlors
was then traced, the testimony being
similar to that given by Mr. White at
a previous hearing. Bollen corrobor
ated the statement made by White that
the metal shells inside the coffins were
reversed, the face caps covering the
fe^t instead of the heads ot the bodies.
He could not tell whether the coffins
had" been opened or not after first be
ing sealed.
Witness found upon opening the cof
fin that the head and neck of Charles
Li. Fair were- wrapped in bandages such
as are ordinarily used by physicians,
and so far as he could judge the band
ages had never been tampered with.
Witness then testified as to having
prepared the bodies for an autopsy by
Drs. Williamson and Galwey. The head
of Mrs. Tair was thoroughly bandaged
in such. a. manner as to protect it from
any ordinary jar, shock or blow to
â¢which it might be subjected in travel
ing. Witness had removed the band
ages and noticed a large wound on the
left temple and *a similar one on the
opposite side. The bones could readily
be moved under the scalp; the jaw
bone was broken and the skull seemed
to be crushed. The, right eye was en
tirely missing. He "could not recognize
the face.
As resarded the head of Charles L.
Fair, \vitnes3 #>nly noticad a flesh wound
on the side of the face, but there was
no evidence of fracture of the skull.
As an undertaker, he stated that the
embalming in both cases was very poor
ly done. '
This concluded the direct examina
tion of the witr.ess and an adjourn
ment was taken until 10 . o'clock this
morning, when he will be cross-exam
ined.
Spring Valley Water Company Tells

Spent In Three Months.
The Spring Valley Water Company

Mrs." Reeves Still a Tenchcr.
Mrs. Irene Doyle Reeves, who was
consolidated out of her position as
teacher of English and history at the
Polytechnic School a few months ago,
was restored to her position yester
day by Judge Hebbard. Attorney
Stephen Costello, her legal represent
ative, secured from Judge Hebbard an
order annulling an order setting
aside the injunction Costello secured
restraining the Board of Education
from dismissing Mrs. Reeves. Â« This
restores her to her position untiksuch
time as the suit for a permanent in
junction is determined.
Daughter Accuses Parents.
Kate L. Redmond is the plaintiff in
a suit filed yesterday to set aside a
deed. The defendants in the suit are
her father and mother, Dennis and
Esther Redmond. She charges that in
September, 1902, her parents plied her
with liquor and then took advantage
of Her^muddled and helpless condition
to prevail upon her to deed to them
a piece of property on Folsom street,
near Twelfth, given to her by her hus
band, recently deceased.
A bold burglary was committed by j
three youths early yesterday morning j
v. jthin a b'.^ck of the Southern police â¢
siaticn. Policeir.cn Tiilman and Tracey j
were on duty at the station and short- Â¦
ly before 2 o'clock heard cries of "Po- :
lice! help'." coming from the dSrectic*n )
of Fourth street, near Folsom. j
Tiilman axd Tracey ran out of the
ftation and saw three men sprinting j
al^r.g Clara street from Fourth to ,
Fifth. They cave chase, aiid Ti!lman !
toon overtook one who fs knov.n as
John McCormick, alias B. Stanley, 23 ;
years of ase. The other two ran Into |
& cellar on Clara street and Police- j
men Shir.kwin and Draper, who had i
also heard the cries whiie on Harri- ;
*on street, joined Tiilman arid Tracey. j
Shinkwin and Draper made their way }
ir.tw the ceiler and emerged with Harry
Cunningham, 1* years of age. Tiilman
turned McCormick ovÂ«r to Tracey, and j
poinjr into the cellar found R. Martin, |
IS years of age, hiding behind the door, j
The man who shouted for the police I
was Joseph C Platz, who occupies a J
rofim with his two sons at 3tS Fourth i
Ftreet. He had been awakened by some ,
one prowlins about in his room and I
paw three men going through the pock- |
fts of his clothing. He jumped out of i
h*d and men ran out of the room.
Platz evened the window of his room
and made his voice heard in the still-
Tjess of the nisht.
The three youths arrested were taken
back to Piatz's room Â«ind he identified
thÂ«*m- He said that two nickel watches j
and a pocketknife had been stolen, and !
when the prisoners were searched the
knife was found in McCormick's pock- ]
The stolen watches were later J
discovered in the garden of a house !
on Clara street, where they had been ;
thrown by the burglars in their flight, j
The men were boeked at the City Pris- i
en on a charge of burglary.
; During the trial it was shown that
Â¦ both had previously been convicted of
Â¦ petty larceny in Stockton. Their' at
| torney objected strenuously to the
J burglary charge but to no avail. The
' criminals were convicted and sentenced
: to long terms of Imprisonment. An ap
| peal was taken to the Supreme Court
j immediately.
The attorney for the defendants ar
i gues that Rosenberg's store was open
I for business at the time the clothes
| were stolen and that therefore his
clients could not be convicted of bur
! glary particularly as the article taken
j was not worth the sum of $50.
The court says the evidence shows
! that the men entered the store with
I the intent to steal and that they are
i therefore guilty of burglary just as
! much as if they had forced the doors
1 during the absence of the owner. The
i law on the subject is quoted and clear
â¢ ly defined so that shoplifters on the
j one hand and the authorities on the
'other cannot mistake the meaning of
1 the dscision.
The Supreme Court gave a definition
of burglary yesterday that will strike
terror to the hearts of criminals and
that will undoubtedly further the
prompt administration of justice in the
courts of California. Any person that
may entrr a house, room or store with
the intent to commit larceny or other
felony is held to be guilty of burglary.
It is expressly stated that it makes no
difference whether the criminal enters
with or without the consent of the
owner.
If a person enters a store during
business hours with the intent to steal
a handkerchief It is burglary Just the
same. Shoplifters, under the new in
terpretation of the lav;, are burglars.
It has long been the general belief that
breaking and entering alone constitute
burglary. It must be shown, however,
that the guilty person or persons in
tended to commit petty larceny, grand
larceny or other felony before they en
tered the premises. Otherwise the
crime must "be considered apart from
the act of entering.
Frank Brittain and J. P. Johnson,
alias Thomas Hollister, entered a store
owned by a man named Rosenberg in
Santa Rosa. They asked to be shown
some cheap suits. "When they left a
suit of clothes was missing and they
were arrested for theft. The crime was
fastened upon them without diffliculty
and they were charged with burglary
instead of petty larceny as Is usual in
?uch cases.
Person That Enters House or
Store Intending to Commit
Theft Is Really a Burglar
J ames W; Bollen Corroborates
Statement That Unfortunate
Woman's Head Was Crushed
Judge Cabaniss dismissed them both
for lack of evidence, tyit he took oc
casion to warn them and all other ne
gro soldiers within the sound of his
voice that the first time there was
sufficient proof before him that any one
of them transgressed a civil law, espe
cially In the way of offering personal
violence to a citizen of San. Francisco,
he would forget all the mercy that his
tender nature teaches him and visit
the extreme penalty of the law upon
them. .
It was a dark day for Judge Caban
iss yesterday. He had on hearing com
plaints against twa negro soldiers, who
were accused of stabbing a negro por
ter named James Parker during a
rough house in a dance hall on Pa
cific street. I. his was conducted by an
other negro, one Lester Mapps. When
alj the witnesses had gathered in the
courtroom ihe bailiffs turned on all the
available lights in order to brighten up
the oppressive darkness..
The case was utterly devoid o-f
"sweetness and light." A.11 of the par
ticipants were negroes, varying in
shade from umber* to the deep black
of a moonless night. One of the de
fendants was familiarly known as
"Pork Chops." Judge Cabaniss did a
little christening on his own account,
and when a witness of a particularly
somber color appeared on the stand he
asked him if his cognomen was "Mid
night."
The complaining witness was stabbed
in the shoulder, during one of the live
liest saloon rows that has ever gone
into a court record. ; Bottles, chairs,
tables, in fact nearly everything in
the saloon except the license>came into
play during the fight, in which forty
or fifty negroes participated. G. C.
Adams, a black spldier of the Ninth
Cavalry, and Charles Heard, ocher
tinted and of the same regiment; were
jointly accused of having Inflicted the
knife wound on Parker.
The witnesses all admitted having
taken Dart in the affray. When the
policy .arrived on the scene Parker was
found* to have received a deep stab in
the shoulder, and Adams was pointed
out as the man who did the cutting.
Heard was arrested jointly as one of
the men who had started the interest
ing proceedings. No weapon -of any

There are thousands of women
to-day praising the celebrated
Hostcttcr's Stomach Bitters.
When they were run down and
in need of a health restorer and
regulator they were persuaded to !
try the Bitters with the result i
that they now enjoy perfect'
health. All sickly women should j
try it at once. Besides curing all j
Female Complaints it is also un-
equalcd for Indigestion, Dyspep-i
sia, Insomnia and Constipation.

THE PARCELS .POST PROBLEM.
AT the Alhambra meeting of the California Postal
Progress League resolutions were adopted urg
ing Congress to take such steps as shall insure
the speedy establishment of a domestic parcels post Sys
tem as rapid, efficient and cheap as any extant in the
world, and calling upon the President and, the Postmas
ter General to enter into parcels post conventions on the
same terms as other members of the parcels post union.
The arguments of the speakers of the evening amply
justified the resolutions. The United States lags behind
other great nations in this important respect* It is
moreover a matter that concerns well nigh every citizen,
for they are few indeed who would not be benefited by
the adoption Â¦ here of some such system, as' that which
prevails in Great Britain and in continental Europe.
By the adoption -of. the resolutions a considerable, body
of representative men have virtually pledged themselves
to support the efforts now being made to bring; about a
speedy establishment of the desired service. It remains
to be seen how far the pledge will be kept, "^ff the reso
lutions be sent . to our; Representatives in Congress and
Enough has been told of the story of the quarrel in the
Far East, in which countless lives and fabulous treasure
have been trembling in the balance, to show that thevic
tory for peace has been won by the Czar without loss'oÂ£
prestige in national dignity or of sacrifice of any of the
vital demands of Russia in her gigantic policy of en
croachment.
The railroad man is a politician in
business and a business man In politics.
Railroad politics requires the highest
order of ability. " This is especially true
now when concentration of control has
brought the railroads of the country
into the hands of a few men. and the
remaining competition consists, for the
ir-ost rart. of the snarrinc for positions
between the heads of these systems.
The situation is not unlike that in Eu
rope between the great powers. Each ife
etrH-Jng: to secure an advantage here
Â»Â»<S aa opening there, without upset-
As this is written the announcement
is made that L. F. Loree, president of
the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, has
been elected to the presidency of the
Rock Island. As the head of that im
mense system he will receive a salary
one and one-half times greater than
that of the President of the United
States, and fifteen times larger than
that of a Senator. His power and dis
tinction will exceed that of even the
Governor of New York, or any member
of the Senate. If he should spend all
his time traveling at the rate of forty
miles an hour for twenty-four hours a
day it would take him eighteen days
to make a complete tour of the entire
system of which he is now head, a sys
tem covering fourteen or fifteen States
and whose gross revenue In a year' is
nearly sufficient to defray the cost of
the Xew York City government. The
system makes no vain boast when it
advertises itself as 'The Rock Island
Slates of America."
The railroad manager, is, in fact, an
executive, a jurist, a legislator and a
diplomat all in one. There is no other
profession that calls into play so many
different qualities. He is both business
man and politician. He enjoys the de
lights of the successful politicianâ those
delights which attend the conduct of
campaigns and the achievement of vic
tories, and at the same time he secures
the great jrains whiÂ«h are the reward
or success in business.
Senator Depew received ninty-nine
votes for the Presidential nomination
in the Republican convention of 18S8,
but he has himself declared that no
railroad man could be nominated for
President. As a matter of fact, how
ever, General MeClellan. who ran for
President in 3 864, had been, just be
fore the Civil War, president of the
Illinois Central Railroad.
There is another reason, however, for
the absence of railroad men in the Sen
ate. There was a time when politics
presented the most attractive career
for a man of ambition, but now the
railroads are strong enough to secure
the best talent in the country. Even
the Senate, distinguished as it is. does
not contain the same amount of brains
as is engaged in the railroad business.
The commercial career now presents
attractions to ambition superior even
to those of politics, and no department
of commerce contains so many oppor
tunities for distinction and gain as that
of transportation.
Now. considering the prominence of
the railroad business in this country,
the immensity of its interests and the
brains engaged in its direction, it cer
tainly seems strange that the Senate
of the United States contains only
two men who have been in any way
connected with the railroads. There
must be some reason for this. One
reason mav be that Senators who in
fact have had some connection with
railroads, as directors or counsel, or
active managers, do not care to ack
nowledge the fact in their biographies.
r.s it might prove embarrassing to
them in political campaigns. A rail
road connection is not a valuable asset
to a politician in a popular sense,
however powerful it may prove as a
secret influence.

fry appointment of President Cleve
land. Senator Ciark says he is ex
tensively engaged in banking, min
ing, manufacturing and various other
business enterprise?. Other Senators
seem to be proud of their connection
with different branches of business,
but out of the entire eighty only two
appear to have now, or at any time in
the past, any connection with rail
roads.
One of the two is Senator Overman
of Xorth Carolina, who, several years
before his entry into the Senate, was
president of the Xorth Carolina Rail
road. The other is Senator Depew,
who takes ninety-one words to tell
of the various positions he has held
in the Vanderbilt system. Senator De
pew is, in fact, the director of more
railroad and other large corporations
than any other man in the United

Railroad Politics.
To learn it correctly requires a little
practice and considerable accuracy.
When Fitzsimmons taught me the trick
it costume a half hour's steady work
and a sprained wrist' before I could
thoroughly master it. â¢ , Â¦
Here it is: Stand on guard. Feint
for j'our opponent's face with your left;
then bring the right foot forward in
front of the left far enough to bring
you close to your opponent. As you
take this forward step with the right
foot swing with your right arm for
your opponent's jaw. Swing and step
must be in perfect accord. Now, if this
swing lands on his jaw (impelled as It
is by the motion of your body and your
quick forward step) you need ask for
no better luck.
Among the many correspondents who
have written to request additional ad
vice concerning this series I. have re
ceived one or two letters- from boys
asking what I thought of prize fight
ing as a profession. Let me say here
for their benefit and for that of others
that prize fighting is a degrading, bru
tal and unprofitable trade, which no
white man ought to adopt. It is better
to work in a trench or a subway than
to enter tho ring. Keep away from the
crazy notion of becoming a pugilist. A
good boxer deserves respect. A prize
fighter too often merits only contempt
He would lead a straight left for his
opponent's face. The other would
guard the blow, throwing it outward.
As he did so McCoy would allow his
left arm to go in the direction in which
the opponent's gesture had started it,
and would bring the arm around in a
sort of downward semi-circle, at the
same time opening his left hand and
holding it rigid. The left "edge" of
his left hand would thus strlke.hfs op
ponent's right side Just over the liver.
The blow would contain momÂ«num
and speed and the sharp. outer side of
the hand would hurt cruelly. A few
such blows on the liver would often
wear down and conquer even a strong
opponent. In a former lesson I showed
you. McCoy's back hand swing for the
jaw.
This 'brings me to one of the most
intricate and effective blows ever in
vented, namely, the famous "shift," in
vented (in its present form) by Fitz
simmons. This "shift" won ' Fitzsim
mons the championship. of the world,
when, at CarÂ«on City, in 1S97, he used
it with such terrific effect on Corbett.
Keep the jaw "in" as much as pos
sible. Let the neck muscles enforce
and protect it- Keep the face turned
slightly to the right, that the area
exposed may be lessened, and that the
left shoulder may partially defend the
jaw from hooks and swings.
In the mix-ups one cannot always
follow this advice. In such an event,
take your chances, and minimize those
chances by clever boxing.
I once nicknamed McCoy "the logi
cian of the prize ring," on account of
the many plans for attack and defense
that he would invariably reason out
before a fight. Sometimes these plans
came to nothing. Sometimes they were
good. Here are two of his best blows:
Leading (straight) with the right or
left, the fist being so turned that its
back was inward and the palms out.
he would land his blow, and as it land
ed he would sharply twist his hand
outward, using the center knuckles as
a pivot, until the palm was inward and
the back of the hand out. This he
called his "corkscrew blow," and he
claimed that the twist thus given added
greatly to the force of the impact. It
is certain that he struck very heavy
blows at close quarters, and the "cork
screw" motion, scientifically performed,
may have been the true secret of it.
The second of his blows that I shall
take up now was as follows:
One of the most important items to
remember in a quick bout is the de
fense of the Jaw. The man who stands
with chin and neck thrust forward or
who allows himself even momentarily
to assume such a posture is taking a
great and unnecessary risk. He is
making his most vulnerable spot un
duly vulnerable.
I do not recommend this "looking
away" unqualifiedly. I merely sug
gest that you occasionally try the ex
periment.
Your adversary cannot then dis
cover so easily what you are about to
do. He will, moreover, be confused
at not meeting your eye. For any
thing unaccustomed tends to confuse
the average boxer â the absence of a
return gaze, the fact of his foe's shift
ing the right foot and arm to the
front, etc.
Now, taken as a* .general rule, this
advice is good. From your adversary's
eye you cap. often determine his next
move. More especially when you have
reached the point in proficiency where
you are able, by some occult sixth
sense, to read the other man's inten
tions.
Rut. on the other hand, he can also
read yours in your eyes, which is more
or less of a disadvantage to you.
Some professionals glare continu
ously at their opponent's eyes. Oth
ers watch tho opponent's gloves, while
still others watch his feet. Both of
these latter classes of pugilists are, of
conr.se, aware of the expression on
their antagonist's face and the dispo
sition of his hands; both (by that
stninge semi-telegraphy known to
good boxers) have a certain "line" on
his probable actions, yet they seldom
Jnok him square in the face.
A boxer must be very sure of him
self before venturing to ]et his eyes
stray from those of his opponent. Yet,
once having mastered the trick of
gauging the foe's actions without the
exchange of glances, the custom of
seemingly looking down while boxing
may at times prove useful.
O!d-time books and masters- of self
defense united in the maxim. '"Always
look your opponent in the eye."

BT ALBERT PATSOJJ TEBHUNB.
Individuality in Boxing.
What England found so difficult in Africa may not be
easy for Russia in Eastern Asia. Russia came near being
destroyed by Charles XII of Sweden, who lost Pultowa
by an accident, and it was winter that whipped Bona
parte. The Russian advance has not been by arms, but
by intrigue. Her long and slow march by which she
emerges into Eastern Asia is the progress of the Ana
nias of nations. Every step of it is marked by bad faith
and by cruelty that would have appalled the Mongol
conqueror?. Now that march encounters patriotism, in
telligence, knowledge of the art of war, a persistent ad
herence to good faith, and every high quality in the
Japanese that Christendom professes and respects.
The Muscovite faces a different problem from that of
the knanates, which have been overrun, one by one. and
quite different from that of China and Manchuria. Dur
ing the Boxer war when the walls of a Chinese fort had
to be breached with dynamite, and those who placed it
would surely die, the Japanese general asked for "vol
unteers who would go and die." The number offering
was so great that he had to select the heroes who were
willing to die for their county's prestige. Taking the
dynamite they went, jocund, to death, and their com
rades who cried "Sayonnara," farewell, envied them the
In fighting such people it will not do to put too much
trust in numbers, especially when the numbers are ignor
ant, brutal and without patriotism. Russia has impressed
the military world more by the display of her armies in
the annual parades than by handling them in battle. Her
prestige as a military power has been achieved at re
views rather than on the field. In the Bdxer war her
soldiers were distinguished by bestiality of the lowest or
der, rather than by conduct in battle. The world, look
ing on at the- prospective struggle, hails gallant' little
Japan, and commends her to the favor of all the gods of
battle. Â¦ W% ..
In addition to these soldierly qualities the Japanese are
patriots. They are educated. While Russia is ahead of ]
Japan in population Japan has a long lead of Russia in
the intelligence of her people. The percentage of illit
eracy is so low that Japan is ahead of some European
nations, but she is farthest ahead of Russia. In the clash
that is coming, then, we will have patriotism and intel
ligence pitted against ignorance, brutality and numbers.
It is by no menas sure that in such a struggle numbers,
will win. We have just seen in the Boer war the value
of patriotism as a sustaining force. England is as much
superior to Russia as Russia is to the wild tribes of the
Lena delta. But, though she conquered the Boers, she
lost her prestige, and is now thoughtfully taking steps to
better a military establishment that was found structu
rally weak in a war with patriots, in which every man
was his own general. There is ever}' reason to believe
that only the anxiety of King Edward to be crowned
with his empire at peace ended that war, by giving the
Boers such liberal terms that they voted to stack arms.
For five years past she has been accumulating^ powder,
manufactured by herself. and imported from the United
States, and the equipment of her army and navy is up to
date. She probably has the largest stock of smokeless
powder in the world for use on her ships. The superior
ity of this explosiblc was shown in our brief war with
Spain. Ships that used the old powder Were soon so en
veloped in *smoke that service of the guns was difficult
and the ships were endangered. At the same time those
that used smokeless powder were fighting in the open
air, and their guns and gear were under proper control,
and capable of effective use. -
To say that Japan is well equipped for a fight is not
denying the equal readiness of Russia. By. deception
and broken promises she has made this war possible, but
by the same cause that brings it in sight she is on the
ground. She has three times the population of Japan and
many times the area aad overmatches her in resources.
But that does not make it sure that she^can hold her
prestige in a fight with the island empire." The Russian
soldier does not know the meaning of patriotism. . He is
a conscript, densely ignorant, driven to fight unwillingly
and without a spark of patriotism. ' His pay is less than
seven cents a month, and he is in all respects a slave as
signed to fighting as a task and his officer is his master.
Only a few of the Russian soldiers know the .name of
the Eastern Asiatic country where they are now. Dur
ing the Boxer war in China they proved themselves the
most ignorant, degraded and brutal troops that ever
wore the uniform of a civilized nation." Their acts were
so abhorrent that they cannot be characterized. At the
same time the Japanese troops in China proved to be the
equal of the best in discipline, in courage and fighting
quality, and far superior to any European troops in ab
stention from, the stealing, murder and other awful
crimes iwhich were committed by the Russians. . -
IN the war with Japan Russian prestige will be tested.
It will be the first military struggle of importance
between Emope'and Asia since the battle of Plassy.
But much has happened since Clive's gave In
dian empire to Great Britain. While China has not
much advanced, Japan has moved up and stands in line
with the Western nations. Whatever Asiatic â¢ grit she
has is aided by the training: of her land and marine
forces in the art of war.

by Betsy Ross was displayed for the
first time on a man of war then lying
in the Delaware. It was subsequently
used as a camp flag of General Wash

strange as it may ssem, not a shred

"At Waterloo the legion won special
laurels by the magnificent way in which
they held the farmhouse of La Haye
Sainte. All day long that Improvised
fortress constituted the center and most
important point of the Duke of Wel
lington's army and was the object of
vigorous attack by- the French. The
defense of the farmhouse of La Haye
Sainte by the German legion has al
ways been regarded as not only one
of the most gallant feats. of^ that his
toric day but as, likewise, having been
a determining factor in the victpry
since, if the French had managed to
storm and take the farmhouse, the cen
ter of Wellington's line would have been
broken and the fortunes of the day In
all probability turned. No Englishman
who knows anything about the battle
of Waterloo ar.d about the farmhouse
of the La Haye Sainte has ever dream
ed of denying the importance of the
defense of the latter or of depreciat
ing the services of those of the legion
who held It from early morning until
darkness set in, when their ammuni
tion gave out and nearly every pne of
them was either killed or wounded."
Now that the British press is still
raging over Emperor William's recent
disparaging allusion to the part played
by the English at the battle of Water
loo it is interesting to read what the
Marquise de Fontenoy says of the ac

A REPORT from London announces that Scot
land Yard, the police headquarters of the city,
has just been provided with telephones for police
purposes. The report goes on to say: "All the impor
tant metropolitan police stations are to be connected
with the postoffice system. The public will not at pres
ent be able to telephone to the metropolitan stations,
but it is understood that this further advance is only a
'matter of time."
To American ears such a report at this late day
sounds curiously illustrative of what Americans regard
as the characteristic sluggishness of the British people.
It is probable, however, that the long delay in furnish
ing the police with telephones has been due mainly to
the excellence of the'government telegraph system and
its well nigh universal use. Where telegraphy is' so
cheap and so ready at hand, there may well have been
considerable opposition to going to the expense of sup
plying telephones in addition. When any human need
is served Well -by some long established means, it is not
> easy to get people to make a change to a new form of
service, . and consequently a thing good in itself very
often retards the adoption of an improvement.
By contrast with the slowness of the British to equip
the London police stations with telephones, there seems
something remarkable in the further announcement from
Europe that the administrative board of railways in
Sweden has recommended to the government to adopt
electric traction on all the state rajlways. Sweden has
such vast and well distributed resources in the way of
water power, it is believed a great economy can be ef
fected by converting it into electricity and using it on
all railroads in pjace of steam. The report goes on to
say: "The present Wention is to convert the suburban
lines running into Stockholm early next year, when a
substantial appropriation on account of cost will be made.
The transformation of the remainder of the system will
proceed gradually."
If we, feel inclined to boast ourselves over the British
because of their slowness in the extension of the use of
telephones, we must lift our hats and do kowtow to
Sweden, that leads : us in the use of electrical energy.
That is the way civilization progressesâ lagging here
and leaping there. No people leads the van along the
whole-length of the line, but each, it seems, has a right
to .boast of leadership somewhere.

to go down again. The tall man had
grasped him by the ankles as he
started to run away and upset him.
.The struggle that then ensued was a
fierce one. First the tall man was on
top and then the short one possessed
the advantage. The fight only ceased
when, completely exhausted, they fell,
side by side. The little fellow's left
hand was still in his vest pocket, while
around his wrist were clasped, with
Jalon-like tenacity, the long thin fingers
of his big opponent.
"Give me the gun; give it to me, I
say!" cried the taller of two men stand
ing in a. dark, ill-smelling alley off Pine
street. "D n you, give it to me."
The short man made no response, but
rammed his hand into his inside vest
pocket and raised his right in a threat
ening manner. With another oath the
tall man leased upon him and bore
him to the ground. :â¢;,;.,

The elevation of General Chaffee to
the rank of chief of staff i3 occasion
for telling an anecdote recently
brought to Washington from Manila.
During the campaign of the allied
forces in China the climate was flllins
the field hospital with victims. General
Chaffee's sympathies were moved by
the sufferings of his men. He entered
the hospital one morning to see how
theâ soldiers were cared for. As he
passed along a row of bunks a tall,
lank soldier arose with apparent weak
ness from his bed. The soldier. stood
at attention while General Chaffee ap
proached.
"How are you feeling, my man?" in
quired General Chaffee.
" "A little better this morning, sir,"
replied the soldier, in a feeble voice.
"What has been your trouble?" in
quired the general, full of thoughts re
garding the Chinese climate.
"Kicked by a mule, sir."
"Oh, you'll recover." said General
Chaffee, curtly, as he hastened down
the line of hospital bunks.
Hopeful.
The. Democratic call leaves the Various States and
Congressional districts free to choose, delegates to the
national convention in any way they prefer, but the Re
publican call states specifically how the choice snail be
made. Delegates must be elected not less than thirty
daj's before the meeting of the* national convention.
Delegates at large are to be elected by popular State or
Territorial conventions, while Congressional district
delegates arc to be elected by conventions called by the
Congressional committee of each district.
There is a world of difference between the tones of the
two documents. The Republican call sounds clear and
definite in every particular. It summons the supporters
of well-known principles and long established policies.
The Democrats call is vague. It seeks to rally men not
??> any definite political creed over which parties may di
vide, but to the general support of purity, economy and
the constitution. Of course all American electors are in
favor of "a pure, economical and constitutional govern
ment." Republican leaders can guarantee that kinfl of
government much more effectively than Democratic
leaders', and the fact that the official call of the latter for
a national-convention has to run in that vague way is a
striking proof of the confusion that still prevails in the
party camp, and the lack of anything like party princi
ples or party policies to which the leaders can appeal.
. Bad as is the situation in the Democratic camp, how
evef, the national convention of the party will probably
prove one of the most interesting in our political history.
The very vagueness of the call will carry to the conven
tion men of all shades of opinion from Clevelandism to
Bryanism, and when the rival clans meet the fight will be
lively. It will also be an important convention, for
should conservative Democracy be beaten this third time
in national convention it would probably pass out like
Whiggism and vanish from our politics, leaving the field
free to the Bryanites to rally all elements of opposition
to the Republican party. Under such circumstances the
campaign would be something like those of 1896 and
IQ02, but ominous of even worse campaigns to come.
FROM the headquarters of each of the two great
parties of the country^ the official call for a na
tional convention has been issued. The Repub
lican convention is to assemble at Chicago on June 21,
and the call runs to "Republican electors of the several
States and Territories, the District oÂ£ Columbia, Alaska
and Indian Territory, and all' other"" electors, without re
gard to party affiliations, who believe in the principles of
the Republican party and indorse its policies." The Dem
ocratic convention is to be held in St. Louis on July 6,
and the call runs to "all the Democratic citizens of the
United States who can unite with us in the effort for a
pure, economical and constitutional government."

"What's the matter with your pres
ent job y ? Suppose I could get you this
commission, what good would it do
you?" asked the Senator.
"You know how it is in the trans
port service. It hurts a sailor's pride
to be compelled to report to a soldier
who probably has only just discovered
that the hulls of ships are hollow,
who calls the bow the thin end and
speaks of upstairs on the balcony
when he means the bridge. I think
the quartermaster captain has the
better job and I want a commission."
"Better stick to navigation, cap
tain. If you got this commission, what
do think the War Department would
do with you?"
"Why, assign me to a ship, I sup
pose."
"Thafs where your sailor simplicity
runs away with you. No, captain. If
you got this commission you would
more than likely be detailed to pur
chase horses or mules; You can serve
your country better where you are.
Better stay."
One of these dethroned sailor kings
had a friend who stands high in the
councils of the Federal Government.
.. "Senator, I want you to get me a
commission as quartermaster cap
tain," was the request the master mar
iner made.
A master mariner in the merchant
service is absolute king on board his

gurated his transport line and placed
army captains in supreme command
of the vessels there was a roar from
the sailormen who received appoint
ments to the position of master. Dur

In May, 1903, complains Mrs. Dunphy,
while they were visiting the Dunphy
ranch at Laposa, in this State. Dunphy
tried to strangle her, and in June, 1903,
while they were staying at Paraiso
Springs Mrs. Dunphy alleges he amused
himself by throwing dishes at her.
From Paraiso Springs the couple
went to Laposa again, arriving there
in July. While there, avers Mrs Dun
phy. her husband took particular de
light in showing his dislike for Benja
min Sunderhaus, her ten-year-old son
by a former marriage. He called both
her and the boy all sorts of names, she
says, and wound up by ordering them
off the ranch. They refused .to go and
he gave orders to the foreman of the
ranch to put them off and to facilitate
their going fired two shots from a dou
ble-barreled shotgun into the walls of
the house where they were. Later on
in the same month, says Mrs. Dunphy,
he absented himself from the ranch for
a whole week and she alleges he was
drunk during the entire time he was
away.
Mrs. Dunphy's complaint closes with
the allegation that on the 18th instant
Dunphy arrived home in the early
morning gloriously drunk and showed
his authority by pulling her out of bed
and compelling her to stand exposed to
wind and weather in her nightclothes.
Mrs. Dunphy says that Dunphy is,
worth 5200.000 and she asks the court to
award her sufficient monthly alimony
to keep her in reasonably good style.
She also wants permission to resume
the name of Sunderhaus. Sullivan &
Sullivan are Mrs. Dunphy's attorneys.
James C. Dunphy. son of the late
William Dunph>\ the cattle king, is
the defendant in a suit for divorce
brought yesterday by Edith Dunphy.
to whom he was married but a few
days more than a year ago in this
city. The separation is sought on the
grounds of cruelty and infidelity, and
if the allegations in the' complaint are
true the Dunphys have had a merry
time of it ever since they became one.
The complaint recites acts of cruelty
alleged lo have been committed by
Dunphy in this city, on two different
ranches, one in this State and one in
Xevada, and at Pdraiso Springs.
According to Mrs. Dunphy, her hus
band, who is well known in club circles
and along the line, commenced abus
ing her in tie month following their
marriage. She pays that in February
of last year he struck her and called
her all sorts of names. This was while
they were living at the Hotel Garlan.
Two months later, while they were
domiciled on the Dunphy ranch in Ne
vada, the plaintiff alleges, Dunphy
atjain abused her. She says she was
compelled to leave the ranch and take
refuge with a neighboring blacksmith.

When Mis. Josselyn secured a divorce
from the attorney more than three
years ago the court directed him to
pay .ier $10 a month toward her sup
port and that of their two daughters.
He failed to do so and a short time
aro narried again, his second wife be
ing a Miss Carrie Andrews, who

In the future Jones, who pleaded that
5T5 a morth was excessive, will pay
$40. As the bicycle man was leaving

LAWYER IN COXTEMPT.
Captain John F. Madden, the crmy

.-er. npainst K<Jith Partello Madden,
vhioh wa? filed some months ago, led
to the dismissal from ILe service of
Lieutenant Hector Rubichon. the co
respondent in the suit, scored a signal
rictory in Judge Hebbard's court yes
terday. The court overruled the de
murrer to his fompiaint. interpÂ»5ed by
his r.ifo on the ground that it did not
stat<Â» sufficient cause of action, and
also denied Mis. Madden? motion to
.dismiss tho complaint on the ground
that the allegations in thÂ«* complaint

also Mrs. Madden's motion to strike
out from the complaint such portions
of !t as referred to the custody of the
one child cf the couple that is now In
thÂ«Â» custody of Jerome Madden, father
of the plaintiff.
Judge Hebbard further refused to
consider the affidavit of Mrs. Madden
filed in connection with her efforts to
have her husband adjudged guilty of
contempt of court because he had not
paid to her the alimony ordered by
the court. It was shcr.vn by Charles

consideration of her receiving $200 a
month for the rest of her life.
"When did you first see these pa
pers?" he was asked.
"The day my brother died," was the
response.
"Did you know anything of the sep
aration of Mr. and Mrs'. Clunie?"
"Not until he died," answered Clunie.
"Mrs. Clunie spoke to me about it then,
and I believe informed me that she had
a copy of these papers." Â¦
- "That's our case," said Attorney Ga
routte. . -'Â¦-. ...
Attorney Slack cross-examined
Clunie for a few minutes,, but did not
materially change his evidence. The
case was then put over until next Fri

evidence for 'he widow. .

Clunie and his wife, Florence. It is

"When did^ you first see it?"
"Shortly -after my brother died," was
the answer. "Mrs. Clunie was present

the will, but would claim half the es
tate under the law governing com
munity property. In other words she
will do battle with the other heirs un
der the will for $500,000 or more instead
of the realty valued at $200,000 be
queathed to her in the will.
After Slack had admitted that the
widow intended to fight the will, An
drew J. Clunie was placed on the wit
ness stand by the petitioners in the
proceedings on hearing, which is an
action to secure for him a partial dis
tribution of his legacy under thfi Clunie
will. His testimony was. intended yÂ»
prove that the Clunie estate was not
community property, 'and that his
brother's wife had waived her inter
est. , ,
He was shown a' paper writing' by
Judge Garoutte end asked if he had
ever seen It before. ',
Mrs. Florence Clunie, widow of the
late Congressman Thomas Clunie, does
not intend to abide by. the provisions
of her iiusband's will. For the flr_t
time sineV the commencement of the
Plymouth Congregational Church on
Post street, in the Western Addition,
is planning to have a full-fledged or
chestra in regular attendance -at , Its
Sunday school every week. As a con
sequence there is a lively flurry among
the young musicians that live in the
part of the city near the ehurch.
Not many'blocks away a full brass
band is maintained by the boys of St.
'Dominic's Catholic Church and it per
forms very creditably on occasion. The
interest the boys take in their band
is, something quite remarkable and
while they . do not play to rival the
famous aggregation " ; headed' by- Sousa,
they have been trained well and are a
creditable body of^young musicians.
Some years ago a Sunday school or
chestra was â¢ organized "In* the First
Congregational Sunday ;school in Oak
land that grew to large size and ren
dered music that was quite . intricate
and ambitious for young amateurs to
undertake. With these demonstrations
of skill among young perforrners oji In
struments when they are properly-dl
recteJ, it is confidently' beloved that
another musical combination; in^febn
nection with a Sunday school can; be
made.
The boys and girls connected*. with
the Plymouth Church Sunday * school
have been invited (all that can play)
to belong to the Sunday school orches
tra and .also to invite '.heir musical
acquaintances to join. No rehearsal
of the young musicians has yet been
held. ' Several quite, clever, amateurs,
in and out of the Sunday. school, have
signified their willingness to attend the
rehearsals and to play regularly. every
Sunday morning as an attraction in
the Sunday school rooms of the church
as a part of the exercises, accompany
ing hymns and occasionally, it is pos
sible, playing some of the lighter mu
sic of the writers of oratfirios like the
"Pastoral Symphony."
The orchestra will undoubtedly do
much to Increase the Interest in the
Sunday school. All orchestrial Instru
ments will be included in the combina
tion.

Some years ago the old Vampire Club
sent an eleven once in each season to
play an association football match
against a team made up of employes at
the Mountain Copper Company's mine
in Shasta County. For two or three
years past no team from San Francisco
has visited Shasta County nor has any
Shasta County team come down to this
.city. Xow, however, the Keswick men
i^have a football eleven and arrango
ments will be made for a match against
a. .California Association Football
League team, the match to be played at
Redding.

The handicap doubles tournament
which was commenced at the Golden
Gate Park courts about a month ago
will be completed to-morrow. The six
teams left to compete are Brabant and
Palmer. Drolla and Gabriel, Bates and
Finnegan, Mann and Finch, Code and
Ambrose and the Hotchkiss brothers.
The finals v.ill be played at 2:30.
There will be a match between Clar
ence Griffin of ttfe Golden Gate Club
and Herbert Schmidt of the California
Club on the latter's courts to-morrow.
This match was arranged for last Sun
day, but the courts were wet. These
two players are-the most promising in
the city, and the match will undoubt
edly be interesting to all tennis fol
lowers. Griffin, is one -of the cleverest
players at the park. Schmidt is the
youngster who recently won the second
class at the club without losing a set.
He is rather erratic in his play, but
liis clubmales think he will bsat Griffin
without much difficulty. The park
players are equally confident that Grif
fin will win and will be on hand, to give
him encouragement and support. Â¦
The biff event for next week .will. ba
the interclub tournament between nine
teams from' .the" California -CJub arul.
nine from the Golden Gate Tennis Club.
It will be played on the courts of the,
former club. This event attracted but
little attention at first, as the Califor
nia Club men cc-nsidered -they ."but
classed their opponents too . much *to
make much of a contest possible.- -ft
has developed that the park players
consider they have as good'lf notta
better chance of winning than the Ca'li
fornla Club men. The Golden -Gate*
Club members concede the first four
matches to the rival club, but" claim,
they can win the next four. " / ,'"
The Golden Gate Club will be rep
resented as- follows: ; Baker brothers.
Carl Gardner and Charles Dunlap.

trifle below scratch. Miss Bessie Val

Smith and Chester." Smith, Miss. Ellen
Page and Ray Cowell will be placed
either at scratch or a little above. Miss
Alicia Mills and Harry Rojfe will prob
ably receive 2-6 from these teams. It
is expected that Miss Hunter and
Frank Mitchell will enter, in which
case they would in all probability play
on the mark with Miss Ratcliffe and
Stringham
About a dozen teams have already
entered and several more are expected
to do so this morning. The tourna
ment committee will nave its % hands
full when it undertakes to handicap
the teams. Much thought has , been
given the matter and it is expected. the
matches in most cases will be close. -
The inclement weather has interfered
with the schedule of the tennis play
ers and they have many, matches and
tournaments to play. The most im
portant event this week is the handi

played on the California Club courts
at Scott and Bush streets this after
noon. Play will be called promptly at

ON THE COURTS
There will '<e an opposition ticket,
which will be headed by. W. G. Morrow
for commodore. As owner of the sloop
Challenger, which he steered to victory
over the sloop Harpoon in the race held
in 1902 for the San Francisco perpetual
challenge cup, W. C. Morrow will com
mand many votes. He has for several
yearÂ«= d .st ben an active and promi
nent member of the club, having filled
the o^ces of port captain and financial
secretary and has been a member of
the regatta committee. He was largely
instrumental in setting the plans for
the *-'oop Challenger and in procuring
the funds necessary for her construc
tion and equipment. As a r: ' lent of
Sausalito he has Interested many of the
Tvell-known people of the town in the
prosperity and welfare of the club.
Â¦As it is probable the opposition ticket
will coniprise several names on the reg
ular ticket, the principal object of con
test will be the office of commodore.
Many yachtsmen think that the com
modore's flag is a proper reward for a
man who has been attentive to his
duties as vice commodore and is ambi
tious to attain the highest office in the
gift of a yacht club.
The annual meeting of members of
the Corinthian Yacht Club and the
election of officers to serve during the
coming year will take place next Wed
nesday evening in Red Men's Hall,
Bush street. The regular ticket, as
made up by the nominating committee,
will be elected, as it is the custom of
Corinthian nominating committees to
name candidates upon whom the mem
bers will unite. Occasionally a show is
made of putting up an opposition candi
date or two, b-Jt this is done with the
Idea of creating a little fun and keeping
things alive rather than with any
cerious intent. The practice of lntro-_
ducins amendments (which had no
chance of being passed) to the constitu
tion and by-laws has fallen into well
deserved desuetude.
Nearly all of the foregoing candidates
on the reprular ticket are yacht owners
or well-known members of the club.
A. C. Lee, now vice commodore of the
San Francisco Yacht Club, was former
ly vice commodore of the California
Yacht Club. He owns the small sloop
Furprise and is part owner of the sloop
Ariel, one of the largest single-stick
pleasure craft on San Francisco Bay.
11. H. Jenness, candidate for the office
cf vice commodore, ".as recording sec
retary of the club several years ago
and is part owner of the large sloop
Nellie. W. H. Gray, candidate for re
cording secretary, sails on the sloop
Halcyon. A. G. A. Mueller Is the pres
ent holder of the office^of financial sec
retary and has been exceedingly active
in improving the clubhouse at Sausalito
end a hard worker for the success of
entertainments given for the benefit of
the club. F. A. Rbbblns, candidate for
treasurer, is the owner of the launch
Rob Roy and the incumbent of the office
for which he has been nominated. Dan
Miller, candidate for port captain, is
owner of the launch Kitty M. F.
Raisch, candidate for the office of
measurer, is owner of the fine gasoline
launch Edwinna.
Dr. T. I* Hill, James Logan and F.
II. Andrews, the committee recently
elected to prepare the regular ticket
for the annual election of officers of the
San Francisco Tacht Club, which will
take place on the second Wednesday In
February, have completed their task.
The following candidates for the va
rious offices have been chosen: For
commodore, A. C. Lee; vice commo

tary. W. H. Gray; financial secretary,
A. G. A. Mueller; treasurer. F. A. Rob

Tim Sullivan has -announced that

For the first time in years the
coursing at both parks will be limited
to one day this week. The entries at
r-'.i parks include 136 greyhounds,
less than one-tenth of those owned in
this district. This means that there
will be a decided improvement in the
quality of the sport, as the entries of
only the higher class coursers will be
received hereafter. The running at
Ingleside to-morrow will commence at
10 o'clock. The likely winners look,

six candidates. E. M. Kellogg names
three of these. John Sutton two and
J. T. McCarthy one.
From the advance proofs of volume
nine of the American Greyhound Stud
book now being compiled by Peer Tif

stands out as the world's greatest
courser. The son of Emln Pasha-LJt
tle Wonder is credited with having
won eight stakes, or about forty-five
individual races, during last year.
Had coursing been promoted on the
same scale as In former years nÂ»
would undoubtedly have rolled up a
sensational list of victories, as he was
winning at the rate of two stakes each
month, these 'being his only starts.
Palo Alto and Sacramento Boy each
won eight stakes in a season that ex
tended over eighteen months Instead
of the twelve in which Pocatelli's rec
ord was made. No English greyhound
has ever equaled these performances,
the sport being promoted there only a
few months in each year.
Full Moon is second on the list of
winning hounds, having placed seven
stakes to the credit of his owner.
Rubber Ankles la third with five vic
tories.
Four Futurity stakes for greyhounds
will be run in the West this year. One
will be promoted In this city by tha
Interstate Coursing Club. There will
bj similar stakes at Los Angeles and
Butte in addition to the Mississippi
Valley Futurity. There have been an
unusual number of January litters

Mr. Kolb was but 40 years of age and
leaves a wife and five children. The
oldest of these is a boy of 14 years, and
the youngest a baby of 10 months.
Mr. Kolb was the leader of the
Olympic Athletic Club for several years
at the time the organization had the
greatest collection of both indoor and
outdoor athletes in Its history. He
came to the club from the Eintracht
Vereln, and at once took a. prominent
part in its exhibitions. He was a bril
liant performer on the gymnasium ap
paratus, but gained the highest honors
as a wrestler. He succeeded Jules Tib
bets, who retired undefeated, as the
coast heavyweight champion, us Un
gerrnan was his most formidable rival,
and they engaged in many memorable
battles on the mat.
About a year ago Mr. Kolb suffered
a nervous collapse, brought on by too
close application to business. Although
he abandoned the active life to which
he had been accustomed, the rest did
not bring him the wished-for relief.
r. -Edward * A. Kolb, one of the most
kno\yn.-,bf the younger genera
tion of merchants of this city, passed
away unexpectedly yesterday at his
country home, in Palo Altoi Although
much concern was felt for him by his
family for many months, both they and
his host, of friends were inexpressibly
shocked by his untimely death.
As a member of the firm of Kolb &
Denhard, the title of which was
changed to E. A. Kolb (Inc.) about a
year ago, Mr. Kolb was known through
out the State. He was an expert on
wines, and built up a big business by
his untiring energy and by his big
warm-hearted manner. He was first
employed as a cellarman'by Kohler &
Van Bergen, and worked himself up
until he had mastered the business.
Sixteen years ago he formed a part
nership-with his brother-in-law, Her
man Denhard. at 422 Montgomery
avenue. The place at once became a
rendezvous for yachtsmen and other
sportsmen. The business thrived, and
some years since Mr. Kolb was able to
gratify a long cherished ambition. The
store in which he had started as a boy
became vacant through the removal of
Kohler & Van Bergen, and his firm at
once moved in.

NEILL- WILLIAMS FIGHT
Referee McDcvltt Declares it "Xo
Contest" nnd Then Decides
In Fnvor of Xeill. .
STOCKTON, Jan. 22.â The best and
fastest fight ever seen here was marred
to-night by the tangled decision Ref
eree James McDevitt of San Fran
cisco rendered. Al Neill of San Fran
cisco and Kid Williams of Stockton put
up a hurricane fight for eleven rounds
before the new San Joaquin Club. For
about seven rounds it was give and
take, but Neill finally floored the Kid
and had him going. Suddenly Wil
liams cut in and all but put Neill
away. For two rounds it seemed a
case of which would fall to the . floor
first, they fought so fast and were so
groggy. In the tenth round the bell
saved Williams and he was in bad

Powers placed the responsibility for
the n-anajfement of the theater upon
Davis, who was the active manager,
while he was but passive in the conduct
of its affairs. The blame for fhe fire
and the consequent lose of life, he put
upon employes who, he said, did not
perform their full duty.
"When U came the turn for Davis to
testify he refused to place the blame
upon any particular person, but said
he had confidence that the employes
of the. theater would attend to their
business properly and he also believed
that the Fuller Construction Company
would erect the building in compliance
with the ctty ordinances. Personally,
he said, he knew nothing whatever of
what the laws demanded In the con
struction of a theater, although he had
been managing theaters in Chicago for
twenty years. He had a general
knowledge of. what was necessary, but
he had never read the city laws cover-
Ing the construction and operation of
theaters.
CHICAGO, Jan. 22. â Will J. Davis

provide proper fire protection.

Two or three more rides like those
on Lady Kent and Lady Bimbo and
the judges should ask Jockey Kunz
from whom he is receiving hiÂ« in
fetructions. Kunz should be yanked
up on the carpet and told in plain
language that he is no longer riding
In "the bushe?," where anything and
everything goes. He is now under con
tract to C. T. Henshall and if that
horseman cannot see the boy's faults
then they should be pointed out to
him alpo.
Hildebrand rode two winners and
three times finished second. His han
dling of Young Pepper, though, threw
a damper on all of his good work. It
â¢uas an effort of which a novice should
be ashamed.
NOTES OF THE TKACK.
A 13 to 20 chance in the betting, Sti
licho, with Hildebrand on his back,
was returned a comparatively easy
winner of the final mile selling run.
Harry Beck ran second, a length or
more in front of Flaneur.
Hildebnind should be presented with
a hand-painted diploma for his ride on
Young Pepper, favorite for the seven
furlong selling affair for three-year
olds. It was not quite so startling as
liis exhibition on Prince Brutus, but
It was good. He got away none too
well with the O'Rourke entry and then
got cut off as many times as he could,
finishing: unplaced. The Cure got away
Quite as badly as Young Pepper, but
Larfen lost no time in getting to the
front. Larfen set a good pace, and
at the wire beat Celebrant, ridden by
J. Daly, a head. Coroner Kelly even
Jed the favorite out for show honors.
Dell suffered a relapse and really rode
a winner in the -six furlong event fol
lowing. Olcnarvon was made favorite
for this number, but cut no figure in
the running, pulling up lame. Bell
.piloted Oro Viva, a 5 to 1 shot, and
taking things quietly to the stretch
passed th<? i>ac* maker. Fair Lady Anna,
scoring easily by more than a length.
MareHo dropped from the clouds, fin
ishing fourth.

just in time to spoil an awful good
thing in th<? first race. Rustic Girl was
played frcm $ to 5 to 9 to 10, the edu
cated coin going into the books by the
carload. Amasa had but 99 pounds up
a/id played" from 23 down .to 16, and
ridden by C. Smith, he jumped away in
the lead" and was never headed, beat
ing out th*> favorite a neck. Lady Kent
ran an indifferent third.
o Another favorite was ftowled over in
thÂ«r mik? and a furlong selling affair.
Frank "Woods, on the strength of his
Â¦second to Royalty in a previous race,
looked" good enough for anybody and
vas installed a 6 to 5 chance. But the
martsmen with . medals would have
none of him. They wanted Illilouon,
the 2 to l second choice, with Hilde
brand up. and Illilouon went out and
made an fixerdse gallop of it in 1:54U.
The favorite was second and Filfe
d'Or third. Eda Riley ran a delightful
last.
With the exception of Stilicho, the
favorites all met defeat, and the books
had a "profitable day. The track was
fast, and there was a large crowd in
attendance.

tfever better than fourth at anv stase
*â¢Â£ Ihe running.
* Futurita! a i'O pounder, piloted by
.Hildtbrand, was the best played one
of the six starters, the Eastern mare's
odds dropping from 5 to 9- to 5. She
ran an cxoMIcr.t race, but was never
r.ble to overhaul Irid^us, the Jennings
entry, which made all the running,
and won cleverly by more than two
lengths. O'Ha-jen, whose odds soared
from â¬ to 20, ran a close third. The
winner ran loose, his odds receding
Irom 2\i to 1 to 7.

Grim of 'Philadelphia won the purse
hung up by the Eureka Athletic Club
In a ten-round bout to-night and an
additional $100 from Joe Gans, who
thought he could put out "the human
punching bag" in â¢ six rounds. Gans
weighed about 138 pounds.- Grim
seemed to- be '; twenty-five pounds
heavier. ; The lightweight champion
cleverly ducked many -..vicious swings
of the Italian. whoVfalled to land a
telling blow. . Gans played throughout
for the. face and .landed enough right
and. left hand blows to have put any
man.in.his class to sleep in the first

Billy Delaney will make a pilgrimage

NEW ORLEANS RACE RESULTS.
LOS ANGELES. Jan. 22. â Changes
of considerable importance have been
made in the minority ownership of
Ascot Park as a result of negotiations
consummated to-day. Thomas Fitz
gerald and George Rose have been
elected directors to succeed the late
John A. Mulr and W. G. Kerckhoff,
who is absent in Europe.
Fitzgerald and Rose have acquired
the holdings of. the men whose places
they take in the management. Both
were already large owners In the new
race course and it is understood each
has more than doubled his original
holdings. Their new investment in
the property is said to represent in
excess of $60,000. Both are interested
in the books at the track.

OAKLAND, Jan. 22. â The San
Francisco, Oakland and San Jose
Railway Company has planned to dig
a tunnel between Broadway aryl Pied
mont avenue,, south of Fortieth street,
to overcome the heavy grade at that
point and to provide level tracks for
its projected connections between UÂ»Â«
Piedmont district and the new ferry
service. The Oakland Transit Con
solidated has petitioned the City
Council for leave to abandon ita
franchise on Fortieth street, between
Broadway and Piedmont avenue. Th!s
is preliminary to the filing of the fer
ry company's application.
The projected tunnel will be 600
feet long and its eastern portal will
be at Howe street, the western level
being at Broadway. The cut will be
dug through property of the Realty
Syndicate and will be wide enough for
two tracks. By the tunnel cut the
company will greatly facilitate opera
tion of its trains into Piedmont.

The overdue Frenchman is a vessel of
2333 tons, and was built in. 1900^ at
Nantes. She is commanded by Cap
tain Guevet.
The British bark Shakespeare, rein
sured at 20 per cent, arrived yesterday
at Valparaiso, 88 days from Newcastle^
Australia. The Martaban is quoted at
80 per cent: Robert Rickmers, 15 per
cent; Loch Brevan, 90 per cent: Castor
and St. Mtrren. 10 per cent, and Alder
grove, 15 per cent.
The French bark' Paris "was quoted
for reinsurance yesterday at 90 per cent
net, ithe highest rate offered since the
lost German ship H. F. Glade figured
on the overdue list. The reinsurance
game is purely a matter of speculation
to the majority, foF few who risk their
money on these particular chances of
the sea have any insurable interest in
the missing vessel. To these, there
fore, the rate at which the Paris is
quoted means that $100 played on the
vessel "to arrive" will net $1000 if she
shows ud.
The Paris was played heavily "not
to arrive" when the rate of reinsur
ance stood at a lower figure. Many of
these early investors sold out as the
rate advanced and some of them yes
terday planked their profits on the
Paris "to arrive," more because of the
percentage than that there is any great
hope of the vessel turning up.
There is some hope for her, however.
She left Hamburg Â£or Honolulu May
10, or 25S days ago. She was spoken
June 26 in 20.03 south, 39.31 west. Other
ships making the same voyage about
the same lime encountered terrific
southwesterly gales off Cape Horn, and^
it is possible that the Paris may have
abandoned the Horn route after a long
struggle and sailed toward her desti
nation by way of the Cape of Good
Hope. The French bark Edmond.Ros
tand, which arrived here the other day,
was 45 days off the Horn. The Wills
cott, now at Port Stanley, put back
to the Falkland Island port after vainly
trying for a much longer period to
weather the stormy headland. The
Kennebec, also being repaired at Port
Stanley, was twice sent to port in dis
tress by the very storms that may^be
responsible for the tardiness Â¦ of the
Paris.

OAKLAND, Jan. 22. â In investigat
ing: the claim of Stewart C. MacMuIlan
for $21,790 80 for discovering "unas
sessed" property. County Expert Sabin
figured out to-day that out of $43,
581 32 worth of taxes, if MacMullan'a
claim is allowed, the county will re
ceive but $7384 32.
In his report to be made to the
Finance Committee of the Board of
Supervisors it will show that on prop
erty claimed to have been discovered
by MacMuIlan there were taxes to the
amount of $43,581 32 collected. He
claims 50 per cent or $21,790 80. The
State gets its full share or $14,406 4S
and the county is left the balance, or
$7384 32, about half of what the State
gets and a third of what MacMuIlan
claims.

REAL ESTATE THANSACTIOXS.
"This matter of the appoi-tment cf
appraisers is now looked upon as a
mere formality, but from now on no
suggestions as to who shall be ap
pointed will be received by this court "
The strictness with which Judpe
Greene has inaugurated his advent in
the prolate department gives attorneys
visions cf a year of enforced adherence
to the rv-les of the court. The appoint
ment of appraisers, the filing of ac
counts and the entire procedure of
settl":-:ent of estates is receiving his
Urictest attention.
The entire practice in regard to the
probating of estates received an over
hauling to-day at the hands, of Judge
W. E. Greene, who took charge" of this
department at the beginning of the
year. Last week he i romulgated an
order that no reports of appraisers of
estates should be filed by the County
Clerk until he had examined them.
This morning he read a lacture .*
forty or fifty members of the Alameda
bar that were present In his court
room, it being calendar day, stating
that the old practice of attorneys sug
gesting who should be appointed ap
praisers of estates would be tolerated
no longer.
The matter was brought up by At
torney J. M. Havens, who presented
an order for Judge Greene to sign ap
pointing appraisers in an estate with
the names of the appraisers already
filled in. The Judge took the order and
then said: "I wish to call the atten
tion of the bar to a rule of the court
in regard to the appointment of ap
praisers. I have had an order appoint
ing appraisers in an estate presented
for me to sign with the names of tt.2
appraisers already filled in.
"I do not wish in any way to reflect
on the integrity of Judge Havens and
would be willing to sign an order blind
folded that he presented. I have the
highest regard for the honesty of the
members of the bar of this county and
State and believe as a whole that they
are not surpassed even by the minis
try. But while I can say this of the
bar in general there are members I
cannot trust and to enforce a rule I
i ust do so regardless of who is the
petitioner.

1118 Broadway. Jan. 22.
Constantio Gratiano. 10 years old,
a witness to the ambuscade and mur
der of his father. Luigl Gratziano,
swore to a complaint this afternoon In
the Police Court which accuses Louis
Orio oi the crime.
The child was with his parent three
weeks ago when the shooting occurred
at Forty-fifth street and Broadway
shortly after a quarrel which Orio had
at the Gratziano home, where he had
been a boarder. Gratziano and the
boy were walking along Broadway
when the father was shot down. His
wound caused pneumonia and paraly
sis and the injury ended fatally' last
night when Gratziano died at Fablola
Hospital.
Gratziano made a dying statement
declaring that Orio was his assailant.
The boy bears out his father's story
and has told the police that he saw
Orio do the shooting.
Dr. George H. Derrick held an au
topsy on Gratziano's body this after
noon, Dr. J. P. Dunn and Dr. O. D.
Hamlin attending. Coroner Mehrmann
will hold an inquest to-morrow even
ing. Orio has been formally charged
with murder.

NEV\ Jan, 22â Another day of ac

â up. in the last re w days. The manner in
which enormous blocks of stock in thousand
. fhare loia were hurlt-d trorn one Krtlon of
the market to another was sufficient evidence
;tr.at leadership of the market was in daring
krÂ»d .powerful hands. About the only news
c from a stock markr^ standpoint was made up
Â«f surmises as to the personality of the newlv
active speculative "arty and the identity of
their operation?, whether on the buying or
'.jtfce â¢Â¦elling side. Some of the Bel*' â¢ was
done in the interm of the principals
.'In the leadership, while their brokers were
also buyir.g at other points with ostentation
: *nd vociferation. The usual difficulty in
ftr. -ing skillfully conducted e;x-culative opera
. tions wae therefore felt on the part pt the
Â°;Â»nxiotis board-room traders who sought to fol
'low the movements of the larger operators
. The popular rupposition was tfcat the newly
: active tarty in the stock market included
: Â«peeulative elements that have been prom.
Â¦ Inent In cotton aud in grain during the rÂ»cer.t
activity la those markets and that something
like 1 pool has been arranged by which these
various elements were acting in concert to
Mft the jtr;ces of stocks to their own profit
The trading presented all the characteristics
*><' the period of activity of euch organized
*pecu!aik,a. The 1 lying and bidding up of
rrices was skillfully shifted from one to
anpther* <juaÂ«f-r calculated to affect opfnon
cr the market pjf a whole, and seiing at
, <ilfcer points ru carried on in the realizing
Â«. profits. Late in the day the reactionary
ten<iency became fairly general binder the
.weight of the saline to rfaiiie. and the level
of prices receded materia!!y from the highest.
The laic seiiir.g was somewhat aggravated by
â¢ tnr reran of a banking failure in Cleveland

CHICAGO, Jan. 22.â On account of crippled
wire service outside tradlnj was light in the
wheat Dit to-day. The market opened .weak,
' largely because of lower cables and large Ar
' gentlne shluments. Another factor was a'
report of additional rain in the Southwest,
effectually . breaking the long drought In that
section. May wan a shade to Â¦'XtJrVic lower
at 01 Uc to Â»lT4c at the opening. The sintl
ment among Dit traders seemed to be de
cidedly bearish and they were inclined to sell
freely. During the first half hour prices de
clined ranidlv and May was soon Felllnc at
91>ic. " Ope-nlng buyinc l>y the bis bull opera
tor terr.Durarlly checked the downward ten
dency and some recovery was inaiie. On every
break the prominent lore would send in buy-
Ing orders ip an endeavor to upport the mar

Conditions and prices In the fruit market
showed but little change from . the previous
report. The cold weather continued to discour
age trade in Oranges and other Citrus fruits,
and most dealers found It Impossible to effect
sales of ordinary stock, even at liberal con
cesBions. The large sizes of fancy Navels
were still in comparatively light supply, -but
there was lees disposition on the part of deal
ers to hold such stock at high figures. Stocks
of Japanese Mandarins are entirely cleaned up
and th--: quotations are withdrawn. There was
a fair attendance at yesterday's auction sale,
but the bidding was slow and fruit went at
rather U*v prices. Four cars of Navels, in
cluding the car of fancy Redlands fruit that
was withdrawn on Wednesday, were sold as
follows: Extra fancy. $1 C0@2 40; ordinary
fancy. $101 50; choice. Â»0c@$l 25; standard
50cfi$l 10. The top price for extra fancy was
obtalnrd only for six boxes of !>6s. $1 00 being
the highest for the other sizes.

Martin Foley, a waiter, was found
dead in his room, 7G5 Market street,
last night. On a table beside the bed
v.aÂ» a paper containing a powder re
sembling morphine. Until an autopsy
is performed the cause of death will
iiot be known. Deceased was a suf
ferer from insomnia and may have
taken an overdose of the. drug toquiet
his nerves. The body was removed to
the Morgue.
Waiter Found Dead in Bed.
On the morning the body of Joseph Blaise, bearing the marks of the
assassin's Made, was found a. gray suit belonging to Leon Soeder, now in
j.iison accused of thÂ« murder of Blaise, was taken to the Native Sons
Cleaning and Dyeing Works. 430 Bush street. That Soeder himself did
hot take the <lolhos to the cleaners was learned yesterday, when *Mrs.
A. de Lareuelle. clerk at the cleaning establishment, positively identified
;i photograph of Joseph R. Xriblas. Soeder's landlord, as that of the man
that took the accused man's Vlit to the store.
The day after the murder was committed it was found that Soeder
llKd sent the rhiv suit he wore on the night of the murder to the clean-
Ina establishment named. It was at first thought that the accused mur
derer took the suit there himself. On subsequent investigation by the po
lk" it was found that it had been delivered at the cleaning works by a
small man of slight build, wearing a dark mustache.
At the time she was interviewed by the police Mrs. de LareueUe
frave them a vivid description of the man that save her the suit to be
cleaned. The police looked everywhere for the man, but were unable to
find him. Every one on whom suspicion fell was interrogated without
avail. Some da2*s after the woman was interviewed by the police she
saw the picture of Xeiblas in "a paper and immediately recognized him
hs the man that went to the store early on the Monday morning: follow
ing the murder.
She at once telephoned for Detective Gibson, and failing to locate
him at the Hall of Justice left word for him to call. It was not until
yesterday that Gibson was able to see her again, not knowing the impor
tance of lier evidence. The police consider the new evidence of great
vslae. Inasmuch as it show* that Soeder was not alone in the disposition
of the traces of the crime with which he iÂ« charjjed.
Mrs. de Lareuclle was seen at the cleaning works yesterday and made
the following statement:
"I am positive that the man that brought Soeder's gray suit here to be
cleaned was his landlord, Neihlas. As soon as I saw his picture published
I immediately remarked to my employer that he was the man the police
were looking: for. Of course, I have not seen the landlord yet, but Detective
<Jil)j=on showed me a picture of him and said that it was a good one. If he
is not the man that brought Soeder's suit into this store on the Monday
morning following the murder of Blaise he certainly is his twin brother.
FACE OF PATKON" I'KIGIiTICNKD THE CLERK.
"1 am skills; to meet him face to face to-day. Gibson is to Wring him
here to UiÂ« store, and if he is anything like his picture I shall certainly iden
tify him. as 1 remember him very well. He was a small man, short and of
Flijrht buikl, and had a fact? that frightene-d me. He had a dark mustache, and
liis Bkln was of a dark hue, leading me to believe that he must have been a
Mexican, a Spaniard or of some other dark-skinned race.
"The rtapon that I noticed him particularly was that he came in a hurry,
about S o'clock in the morning, and did not wait for the usual numbered
ticket which we give on the receipt of any article. This man seemed to be
in a Ricat hurry. He deposited the bundle on the counter and said: "Here's
a suit to be cleaned.' When I told him to wait until I could give him a
ticket he replied that the name was on the package and rushed out.
"I looked on the package for the name and found inscribed thereon the
words 'I^eon Solder." There was nothing unusual about the occurrence, and
I thought no more of it until the police visited me the next day. Detective
Gibson was here two or three times to-day, and seemed to think that what
I told him was of great importance."
ThÂ»Â» positivencss of Mrs. de Lareuelle's statement on viewing the picture
of NHblas, which was a particularly good one. leads the police to believe
That she must have seen Neiblas. Xeiblas has been interviewed several times
by the police, but up to yesterday they had never connected him with the
case in any way.
Joseph Xeiblas was seen last night at his house at 827 Jackson street
and indipmantly denied that he had taken Soeder's clothes to the Xative
Sons Cleaning and Dyeing Works on Bush street. He said:
"I never had much to do with Soeder. He once approached me to go
out to Miss Flatley's house and try to get her to return the jewelry he
had {riven her. I did not take readily to the proposition and he dropped it
for a couple of days. Then he came again to me and I Inferred that he
wanted me to break into the woman's house and get something out of
his trunk, which he said he must have at once. When I did not seem to
enthuse over the proposition he left me. As for taking his clothes down
to th*> cleaning-place, I know nothing about that.
"There was a man here one day looking in the window, and whom I
afterward saw Soeder and Blaise talking to, that looked very much like
me. He wore a cap and overalls and had a bad face. This may have been
the man whom Soeder got to take his clothes to the cleaner's."
DENIES YKEVIOUS ACQUAINTANCE WITH SOEDER.
Neiblas was closely questioned in regard to his previous acquaintance
with Soeder, prior, to his taking rooms at his house with Blaise. He de
nied that he had ever met Soeder before Soeder went to his Jackson-street
house. Xeiblas said he had lived in the house he is at present occupying for
one year, and prior to that lived on Broadway, near the Latin quarter.
To-day Detective Gibson will give Mrs. de Lareuelle a chance to see
Xeiblas and further complete her identification. He would have done so
yesterday, but Neiblas was at work at the Vermont Marble Works, where
he Is employed as a marble polisher.
The police are still working in the Barbary Coast section of town and
expect to show that Soeder was not in his room, as he has stoutly main
tained, on the night Blaise was murdered on the side of Russian Hill. The
new piece of evidence supplied will be followed and If Neiblas is the man
whom Mrs. de Lareuelle saw he will be given a chance to explain why
he has kept quiet the fact that he delivered the , gray suit that Soeder is
known to have worn on the night of the murder. Although Xeiblas has
Ueen interviewed many times In regard to what he knows about the move
ments of Soeder on the night of the murder he has not given the police
any definite knowledge as to whether Soeder was in his room at the time
he says he was or not.
He has said that he was upstairs hammering and -working on some new
fixtures and would not have heard Soeder if he had come in between the
hours he claims he did on the night of January 10.
Further evidence showing the criminal nature of Soeder was found yes
terday by Detective Gibson. A man named C. Webster, a sea cook, residing
at S28 Fremont street, called at the Hall of Justice and told Gibson that he
had worked with Soeder in Alaska for several years.
"Once while we were on shipboard." said Webster, "Soeder was working
as a cook and the captain asked him to make his, the captain's, wife, some
biscuits. Soeder had a lot of morphine, chloroform, cantbarides and other
poisons in his trunk and remarked that if the captain's wifewanted biscuits,
â¢she would eat them in hell.' I met him on the street a few days before the
murder of Blaise and remarked to him that he was looking fine. I asked
him if he was going to Alaska this year again, and/he said that he was not,
as he was going to have all the money he wanted In a few weeks."
The police regard this as good evidence, as-it helps to verify that of a
similar nature already obtained. : *>-,
A letter from Blaise's wife written January 10, the day~Blaise was mur
dered, arrived at 827 Jackson street yesterday. The police took it in charge.
It is a pathetic incident, as it was written on the day Blaise met his death.
Mrs. A. de Lareuelle Supplies Important
Link in the Blaise Murder Case.
MRS. A. DE LAREUELLE, clerk at the Native Sons
Cleaning Establishment. 430 Bush street, told Detective
Gibson yesterday that she was almost certain that the
njan that took Socder's gray suit to the establishment to be
cleaned on the morning- of the Blaise murder was Joseph
Xeiblas. Mrs. De Lareuelle received the suit that Soeder sent
to be cleaned the morning after Blaise was murdered. She
positivelv identiried Xeiblas bv his picture. Xeiblas is landlord
of the house at which Soeder and Blaise roomed. (

Yesterday it was rumored that some
turn had been reached In the salt war
now raging in this city by. which re
conciliation was about to be effected.^
Large buyers of salt that have been
holding back notwithstanding the pres-'
ent low price for salt having^in ;View
the possibility that a still lower; level
might be reached were interested, be
cause the return of harmony between
the warring salt companies would cause
an immediate rise in the market. ' .
Inquiry led to the fact that there
is no compromise in slgnt nor is there
any chance of a near settlement of dif
ferences. Ton salt, which is the col-'
lective way of describing several
grades, was going freely yesterday to
any one that wanted it for $4 a ton,
or perhaps lower. Yet there were not
many buyers. The fish companies that
have immediate need of salt have laid
in their winter stock, but jtheir greatest
need is in the spring. Then, naturally,
the heaviest buying takes place. ,-. It is
not supposed by any of the salt'buy
ers that the war. now in progress can
be maintained until spring.
On the other hand, the companies,
the Amalgamated and the Imperial,
while they agree that some settlement
eventually will be reached, deny that
the situation Is liable to change for
some time. There are at least 120,000
tons of salt that are in the hands of
the companies now. This vast bulk- is
a sufficient supply in itself for the Pa
cific Coast for quite a long period.
Rather than to have outsiders break
into the market some of Jhis salt will
be practically given away. The
ample of the shipload of salt imported
