JAPANESE AROUSED
BY THE REPORTS OF
RUSSIAN BRUTALITY
TOKIO, Feb. 16.â .The Government is
receiving' additional circumstantial re
ports of the alleged cruelty of Russians
toward Japanese refugees from Man
churia. The Japanese Consul General
at Tientsin has just telegraphed to the
authorities here giving a recital of the
story told by thirteen women who had
just arrived at Shanhaikwan. The
thirteen "were" residing at Harbin and
started south on February 9 with 300
companions. One-haJf of these, with
the women, reached Mukden on the
10th and were ordered to leave the train
by Russian soldiers, who cruelly abus'ed
them and detained the party, which
tfcey divided, the men being ordered, to
proceed ' to ' Port "Arthur. The women
SAN FRANCISCO, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 1904.
were sent to Newchwang, where United
States Consul Miller provided food and
transportation, for 'them to Shanhal
kwan.
The women say they saw several
Japanese refugees cruelly beaten and
wounded. They say that the Russian
soldiers robbed" them < of money and
Jewelry. Some of the Japanese escaped
punishment by bribing the soldiers.
The Japanese Government people
are â¢ deeply stirred by these reports.
They point to their own correct attitude
toward the Russians in Japan and de
nounce the Russians, as barbarians.
The sinking of the Nakamura Maru
arjd the treatment of the. refugees are
creating a feeling which betokens a
bitter and relentless war. It Is im
probable that â¢ the Japanese will re
taliate in kind whatever excesses the
Russians commit. .
The Japanese are unable to under
stand Why the men and women refugees
from Harbin were divided. It is sug
gested that Russia Intends to hold"-the
men at Port Arthur in the hope of
avoiding a bombardment. This, how
ever, appears. extremely improbable.

Attacked by Diseases Due to Cold, Exposure and the Terrible Strain of Their Work, Motormen

The daily work of a motorman is enough to break down a constitution of steel. He must face cold and storm day and night.
Cooped up on his narrow platform, he must stand, while bitter winds pierce him to the bone, no matter how heavy his clothing. Every
minute he must be on the alert, and in the midst of suffering his judgment must be quick and sure, for an error may cost a human life.
Tired and hungry after hours of work that keep his nerves tense as fiddle-strings, he sits in the corner of a car to devour a cold, hasty
meal from a tin pail. These brave men aresexposed to risks as great as those of the battlefield. Fortunately, when nature can stand the

Almost every one, from personal experience, knows that the effects "of any kind of severe physical strain are felt, first of all, in the
small of the backâin other words, in those Vital Organs, the Kidneys. This is as true in the case of the very powerful mamas it is with one
of less strength, and it is especially true whenever^ the kidneys are weak. Weak and unhealthy kidneys are responsible for more sickness
and suffering than any other disease, therefore, when through neglect or other causes, kidney trouble is permitted to continue fatal results
are sure to follow. - ' " : â
SWAMP-ROOT STRENGTHENS THE KIDNEYS and through them helps all the- other organs. When this wonderful medical discovery
can put the human body into condition to the hard work and th$ tremendous strain of the motormen/it is easy to understand how
it has cured thousands upon thousands in the more ordinary and less strenuous walks of life.
No matter how many doctors you have triedâ no matter how much money, you have spent on other medicines âyou really owe it to
yourself and to your family to atleast give Swamp-Root a trial. Its strongest friends to-day are those who had almost given up hope of
ever becoming well again. . \

WASHINGTON. Feb. 16.â The rebels
In Santo Domingo have committed an
other breach of international law, which
added to those preceding Is making
up a formidable case that may justify
the United States Government In inter
vening to restore order and protect the
property in the distracted island. To
day Minister Powell reported to the
State Department that he had received
belated advices from Jean Villaine, the
vice consular agent at Samana, dated
February 9, to this effect: -
"Insurgents entered our consulate at
Samana with armed force and took
two refugees out." ',
The State Department promptly com
municated this information to the Navy
Department, with a request that proper
action be taken by the naval authori
ties to protect the United States con
sulate. This was promptly transmitted
to Admiral Wise, and it is the belief
that he will not only protect the con
sulate, but will demand the. punishment
of the perpetratoÂ«s Of this outrage, and
If the , provisional , government is not

NATION'S NOTABLE MEN
TO HONOR DEAD SENATOR
Impressive Funeral Services Which the President and a
Multitude of Dignitaries Are to Attend Will Be Held
To- Day in the Chamber Where Hanna Had His Seat
WASHINGTON, Feb. 16.â The House
will convene at 11:45 a. m. to-morrow,
when s the members will march in a
body, with Speake^ Cannon at their
head, to the Senate, there to render
honor to the memory of the late Sen
ator Hanna. The official order setting
forth the order of the services at the
funeral has been prepared by the Sen
ate committee in charge of the arrange
ments, as follows:
The Senate will meet at 12 o'clock
noon. The body of the late Senator M.
A. Hanna will be placed in the Senate
chamber prior to the assembling of the
Senate. The President of the United
States and his Cabinet, the Chief Jus
tice and Associate Justices of the Su
preme Court, the House of Representa
tives, the diplomatic corps, the admiral
of the navy and the lieutenant general
of the army have been invited to attend
the services in the chamber and will
occupy the seats on the floor of the
Senate assigned by the sergeant-at
arms. Upon the announcement of the
Senate President pro tern, the clergy
will conduct the funeral services. All
the Senate galleries will be reserved
for this occasion, admission being by
special cards only.
MRS. IIAXXA PROSTRATED.
Mrs. Hanna is feeling the effects of
the strain on her strength incident to
her ceaseless vigilance at the bedside
of the late Senator during his illness of
two weeks. To-day for the first time
she was very much prostrated. She
rallied again, however, and during, the
latter portion of the day saw friends
who called to express their condolences.
Sh'e expects to attend the funeral cere
monies in the Senate to-morrow and to
accompany the remains of the late Sen
ator to Cleveland to-morrow night.
At the White House to-day the Presi
dent and all the attaches shared in the
general sorrow over the death of Sen
ator Hanna. President Roosevelt, the
members of his Cabinet, Senators and
Representatives in Congress and callers
of all classes sadly paid tribute to the
memory of the dead statesman.
Representative William Alden Smith
of Michigan related at the White House
a touching incident of a recent conver
sation he had with Senator Hanna. He
went to Senator Hanna in the Senate
chamber one day and invited him to at
tend as one of the distinguished men of
the country the semi-centennial cele
bration of the founding of the.Republi
can rarty, to be held at Jackson, Mich.,
on July 6 next.
PREMONITION* OF DEATH.
"I don't know where I will be then."
was the Senator's pathetic reply to the
invitation.
"Why, you will be right here, of
course." returned Mr. Smith, reassur
ingly.
"No," replied Mr. Hanna, "I am
afraid I won't."
"I walked to the rear of the Senate
chamber," said Mr. Smith, "and looking
back at the Senator wondered if he had
a premonition that he might not live
long. The Impression mads by his
word3 never left me." _
At the meeting of the Cabinet to-day
the death of the Ohio Senator was la
mented deeply. All the members enter
tained for him the profoundest regard
and respect. The opportunity afforded
by the "meeting was embraced by all
t-re c vnt to pay personal tributes to their
dead friend. Little business was
transacted. The members decided to
assemble at the White House at or
about 11 o'clock to-morrow to accom
pany the President to the Capitol to at
tend the Senate funeral services.

EULOGY OP LABOR LEADERS.
President 3Iltchell of United Mine
Works and Others Deplore Demise.
INDIANAPOLIS, Feb. 16.â President
Mitchell of the United Mine Workers
of America has sent a personal tele
gram of condolence to Mrs. Hanna. say
ing that in Senator/Hanna's death la
bor'has lost a sincere friend.
Mr. Mitchell said to-day:
"The death of Senator Hanna Is a
distinct loss to the cause of industrial
peace. The latter years of his life were
given to the promotion of the work of
reconciling the interests of employes
and employers. I enjoyed the friend
ship of Senator Hanna and his confi
dence in matters of this kind, and I
know of many things he has done, of
many sacrifices he has made in the in
terest of organized workingmen^ for
which he neither souarht nor received
credit. His efforts as chairman of th*
National Civic Federation brought, him
into close relationship with nearly all
the trade union movements, and he had
the respect of all men."
William Huber, president of the
United Brotherhood of Carpenters and
Joiners, said:
"In the death of Senator Hanna I
feel that this country has lost one of its
greatest statesmen and leaders, one
whose loss will be felt among all men.
one who dared to do and say what he
thought was right, irrespective of what
the opposition might contend for."
President Lynch of the International
Typographical Union said:
' "Occupying such a commanding posi
tion in public life Senator Hanna
wielded an Influence that was prolific
in results, and his tolerant and reason
able attitude on the questions that are
causing strife between capital and la
bor created a better feeling and a bet
ter understanding on the part of the
disputants and the public generally.
The sentiment thus created will not dte
with Senator Hanna. It will live long
er than the remembrance of his political
victories."

WASHINGTON, Feb. 16.â The Na

Members of the committee asked th*
several women speakers from Colorado
as to thi> reason of Shafroth's action
in resigning his seat in the House yes
terday because of fraud at the polls.
Miss K'lis Meredith, wher made the
first answer to the question, said the
fraudulent vote on this occasion was
confined to certain Denver precincts.
She exonerated the women voters from
participation. She said that 55 per cent
of the voters of the State were men
and 45 per cent were women, while 42
per cer.t of the actual vote was the
vote of the women.

On the Sutter County side and in the

there is no danger. The levee system
around the city is perfect and a rise of
many feet could be experienced without
any uneasiness. The levee on the Linda

WOMEN, WEARY OF LIFE,
SEEK TO END THEIR DAYS
Julia Lowe, Domestic, Shoots Herself Twice and Tells
Weird Tale of Battle With Burglarsâ¢ Mrs.- Driscoll
Drinks Carbolic Acid and Dies in Her Husband's Arms
YOUNG DOMESTIC WHO SAID SIIE HAD BEEN SHOT BY BURGLAR.
AFTERWARD CONFESSING SHE HAD Till ED TO KILL HER
SELF, AND WIFE OK PHYSICIAN WHO COMMITTED SUICIDE.
Two women, feeling that life was no
longer worth the living, attempted sui
cide early yesterday morning. Both
attempts were evidently cases of ex
treme despondefney, resulting from
physical ailments. As a result, one
woman is dead and the other lies in
a precarious condition at the City Re
ceiving Hospital. One used a cheap re
volver of small caliber and the oth.er,
the wife of a physician, took carbolic
acid with fatal results. Both were still
youthful enough, in the ordinary course
of nature, to have had many years of
happy life before them, but they chose
a direct plunge into eternity to an un
known future in this world and a nat
ural ending.
Julia Henrietta Lowe, a divorced
woman employed as a domestic at 2440
Jackson street, attempted to end her
life at an early hour yesterday morn
ing and incidentally had the police
scouring the neighborhood for hours in
search of an imaginary burglar. At the
Central Emergency Hospital, where she
now lies hovering between life and
death, the woman appended her naiiie
to a romantic story of a midnight
struggle with a burglar, which she aft
erward confessed was pure fiction.
About 2:30 o'clock yesterday after
noon the occupants of the house were
aroused by screams for help. Mrs.
Lowe was found lying on the floor Of
the dining-room, bleeding from wounds
in each breast. When questioned as
to how she had received her injuries,
she told a sensational story of a strug
gle with a burglar, who, after â wound
ing her, had fled from the house.
3IA1LES CONFESSION'.
The woman was removed to the
Emergency Hospital and the police at
once notified, Detectives Coleman and
Braig being detailed on the case. At
the hospital it was found that the
wounds had been inflicted with a pistol
of small caliber at close range, as the
woman's clothing was powder burned.
To the detectives she stated that she
was aroused during the night and
found a strange man in the dining
room. She did not scream, but at once
grappled with him. He fought des
perately and finally, drawing a revol
ver, fired two shots. Sc- vivid was the
imagination of. the woman that she
even described the man's appearance
and dress.
Her tale, however, lacked the ring of
sincerity and the detectives made a
second visit to the house. After a care
ful search they found the revolver hid
den under a cupboard. It was taken
to the hospital and shown the woman,
who admitted that she had purchased
it Saturday night and had attempted
to- commit suicide. She further stated
that she had been despondent for a
number of years and was tired of life.
She wrote the following note of apology
to her employers:
Air. and Mrs. Bishop â Will you pleas* for
give me and lorset me and all the trouble I
liave made you. 1 thought to end It all, for
life is too hard for me to live. 1 may die yet.

Effie May Driscoll, wife of Dr. E. P.

o'clock yesterday morning. The only
witnesses in the case are Dr. Driscoll

ened to commit suicide. A few months
ago she procured a bottle of carbolic
acid from his office and secreted it in
their apartments. It was discovered by
her son. who brought it to Dr. Drisfoll.
From time to time during fits of de
spondency she had reiterated her de
sire to be out of the world. The recent
deaths of several of her friends, who
were suffering from troubles similar to
her own, had added greatly to her de
spondency.
Early yesterday morning Mrs. Dris
eoll entered the doctor's office, at 16J5
Polk street, and secured a bottle con
taining about two ounces of carbolic
acid. Returning to her apartments she
drank a portion of it and fell scream
ing to the floor. Miss Hughes respond
ed and at once summoned Dr. Driscoll.
He worked for an hour and a half, but
was unable to save the life of his wife.
He attributes her speedy demise after
swallowing a comparatively small
quantity of the poison to the fact that
it was taken on an empty stomach.
Mrs. Driscoll leaves a son 14 years of
age, the result of her former marriage
to a man named Hitchcock. She had
been married to Dr. Driscoll about six
years, and. he says their family rela
tions were always amicable. She was
33 years of age and a native of Missouri,
but came to this State with her parents
when a child and was reared in the
vicinity of Hanford.

DECIDE ARREST
WAS JUSTIFIED
Police Commissioners Pass on
Case That Threatens. Compli
cations With Chinese Nation
KEP0RT BEADY FOR MAYOR
Say Tom Kim Yung, Consulate
Attache Who Killed Himself,
Was'Not Unjustly Treated
The Police Commissioners of this city
and county have rendered a decision
exonerating Policemen John Kramer
and Joseph Brodt from all responsibil
ity in connection with the death of
Tom Kim Yung, an attache of the Chi
nese consulate, who committed suicide
about four months ago. A copy of their
decision will be forwarded to Mayor
Schmitz to-day and it will eventually
be presented to the Chinese Govern
ment by the authorities in Washing
ton in response to its request for an
investigation. 1
The case is one of importance, inas
much as it bids fair to create interna
tional complications. Though a deter
mination has been arrived at by the
Police, Board, it may by no means be
conclusive, and much conjecture is in
dulged in regarding its disposition by
the Chinese Government when it is re
ceived bv them.
Tom Kim Yung was arrested by Po
licemen Kramer and Brodt for a se
rious offense. He offered resistance,
but was taken to prison, charged and
brought into the Police Court. Before
the case was concluded his lifeless body
was found in the consulate one morn
ing, he having committed suicide by
the use of opium and gas. A note left
by him stated that he could not bear
disgrace and proclaimed his innocence.
Soon afterward the Chinese Minister
a,t Washington requested the Secre
tary of State to institute an inquiry
and to place the blame where it be
longed. - The Secretary of State in turn
forwarded the request to Governor Par
dee and the Governor turned it over
to Mayor Schmitz. The Mayor, after
due deliberation, ordered an investiga
tion by the Police Commissioners and
the. board heard the case on three dif
ferent afternoons.' At each session por
tions of the testimony were taken and
the incidents leading up to the arrest
thoroughly sifted. The commission re
served its decision until last night,*
when a written deciston exonerating
the policemen was ordered sent to the
Mayor.
During the meeting of the board last
night James S. Hester, formerly of
Texas, applied for a liquor license at
the corner of Pine and Laguna streets,
and his request was granted. As he
passed out it was discovered that he
carried a large revolver in. his pocket,
and instead of going back to his busi
ness he was taken to the City Prison
by Sergeant John Green and booked on
a charge of carrying concealed weap
ons. The case of Alex J. Truman,
â¢whom the board claims has been in
possession of a special policeman's star,
but who has not attended to his beat,
was put over for one week. The same
disposition was made of the case of
Policeman Peter S. Chappell. who. it
is alleged, owes Judah Boas $420, which
he refuses to pay. The license of Clar
ence L. Lucky, a chauffeur, was re-

RUINS TOPPLE
IN THE STORM
BALTIMORE. Feb. 16. â To-day
was. one of the severest of the winter.
The temperature was as low as seven
degrees above zero, and all day long a
gale blew through the ruins in the
fire district at a forty-"mile gait, mak
ing conditions dangerous for all with
in the lines. A number of tottering
walls were blown down and bricks, tin
roofs and debris were sent flying in
all directions. The workmen and
militiamen on guard suffered keenly
from the piercing blasts.
The extremely cold weather has
also had the effect of freezing up the
whole devastated area, and most of
the streets, which were only recently
cleaned of debris, are now covered to
a depth of two or three inches with
ice.

Russia Awaiting
Excuse to Pass

Special Dispatch to The Call
LONDON. Feb. 17.â France, says
the Paris correspondent of the Times,
has decided to charter the steamship
Cbolon to transport to the Far East
St'O men, with officers, of the Forty
sixth Colonial Regiment.
The Government asked the Com
pagnie Nationale the exact number of
vessels that could be plated at its dis
posal for the conveyance, in case or
urgency, of new troops to the Asiatic
colonies.
â¢ The Brussels correspondent of the
Times says the Dutch Government has
dh-ji.-tiched three cruisers to guard the
poit of Subang. Sumatra, which lies
on the direct route for the Far East.
Although international law admits
the theory that warship* may obtain
sufficient coal from R neutral port to
reach the nearest home port. Holland
evidently is resolved to avoid compli
cations by a literal enforcement of her
declaration of neutrality.
BERLIN. Feb. 16.â Although it is
denied In Constantinople that Russia
luis :tsked for permission to pass her
ships through the Dardanelles, it is
known here that, a? soon as England
takes any steps to change the present
position in Egypt and the Mediterran
ean Sea in violation of the Berlin con
gress. Russia will pass her vessels
through the Dardanelles.
The newspapers of the world are ac
tive in discussing Germany's policy in
the present struggle, without hitting
the truth. Chancellor von Bulow is
following; the lesson learned by his
master. Bismarck.
The late Chancellor's idea is made
clear by a timely article just published
by Dr. Chrysander, formerly physician
to the Chancellor. To him Bismarck
onoe paid:
"The greatest foolishness of my dip
lomatic- life was the Berlin congress.
I should have allowed Russia and
England to eat themselves up like two
lions in a forest. Then we would now
have more influence than the rest and
less danger. I made politics that time
like a city Alderman."
1 learn the unpublished fact that
Bismarck also declared he regretted
that at the Berlin congress he had
not allowed Russia to go to Constanti
nople.
TRILL OF LARK
IN HER THROAT
By Blanche I'artinston.
It does not surprise to learn that
Mme. Lillian Blauvelt, the charming
soprano, who made her local debut
last night at Lyric Hall, was a violinist
before she became a singer. She swings
that way â in the fashion of a roundly
cultivated musician. Possibly most
Jike the regretted Mrs. Henschel in
her methods is Mine. Blauvelt â a Mrs.
Henschel with a voice be it said.
There is the same exquisite accuracy
of reading, the same unerring taste,
the same polished detail. Like Mrs.
Henschel's, too, Mme. Blauvelt's is a
completely conscious art. Nothing
quite sings itself with her, and one's
hat staye quite decorously on one's
head â if it belongs there â while one
listens. Yet this accomplished Amer
ican, who comes to us with the adula
tory scent of Covent Garden t>ouquets
Btill about her, is one of the most thor
ougrhjy charming: singers we have had
here. No one interested in songs or
Einging â and a very lovely young
woman â should -miss hearing her, and
there will be two more concerts for
opportunities.
The Blauvelt voice is delightful.
There is a comfortable plenty of it. to
begin with, and its volume in the upper
range is peculiarly full and its quality
almost throughout fine and pure. The
lowest notes thin out noticeably, but
as these are discreetly seldom used. It
matters little. But the whole vocal re
source is used in a faclleand musieian
ly manner that constantly delights.
Mme. Blauvelt's trill wan â¢ probably
born, not made â it is a liquid and
larklike wonder, almost absolute In
its evenness. But there is the same
fluent and delicate precision In her
eealemakingr. in her arpeggl, at every
need of flexibility. The singer's enun
ciation, too, is admirably clear and
her phrasing most intelligent. There
â¢was observable last night a tendency
to flat â perhaps a passing trespass.
With the exception of some indif
ferent examples in her English group.
Mme. Blauvelt's programme was a
chjoice and pleasing 1 one. It is not
easy to understand, however, why the
banal Randegger "My Heart" and the
equally unnecessary "'Stolen Wings" of
Wlllcby should have been chosen.
Surely with MacDowell, Oscar Weil,
Footc, Chadwick, right at home, the
einger need not have gone so far to
fare so ill. Possibly the singer was at
her best in the "Fruhlingslied' of
Mendelssohn, sung with enchanting
gayety. The pretty "Will Xleman
Singen" of Hildach also found her in
charmingly responsive mood. One re
membered the singer's Covent Garden
laurels with her "Una voce poco fa,"
rendered with delightful technical
adequacy and no little dramatic ac
cent. The rarely heard "Les Vepres
Siciliennes" of Verdi gave us the
Blauvelt trill and several other sorts
of satisfaction, and the "Comin* Thro'
the Rye" encore that evidenced it the
engaging naivete that Is the peculiar
Blauvelt charm. The singer was
greeted throughout in friendly and ap
preciative fashion by a fair audience.
To-morrow evening's programme is
as follows, and the third and last,
equally interesting, will be given on
Saturday afternoon:

SINKING OF THE BOYARIN
HEAVY LOSS TO RUSSIA
One Hundred and Ninety-Seven Officers and Men
Perish on Cruiser Blown Up at Port Arthur.
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 16.â The re
port that the Russian cruiser Boyarin
Mas blown up last Saturday at Port
Arthur and that all of her officers and
crew, 197 in number, were lost, is con
firmed from a private source.
The Boyarin "was 348 feet long, of
41 feet beam and 16 feet draught. She
was of 2200 tons displacement and her
trial speed was 25 knots. Her arma
ment consisted of six 4.7-inch guns,
eight 1.8-Inch guns, two 1.4-inch guns
and three machine guns. She also wa.s
fitted with six torpedo tubes. The
Boyarin took part in the engagement
of February 9 at Port Arthur.
Information has been obtained at the
Foreign Office that Secretary Hay's
proposition to limit the area of war
operations is considered "practicable"
and that a response will soon be forth
coming. Viceroy Alexieff is being con
sulted and the authorities are doubtless
awaiting an indication as to how the
proposition will be received by Japan.!
The sympathetic reception given by
the powers to Hay's note and the rep
resentations the powers have made here
have undoubtedly had a good effect
upon official opinion and'the Russian
Government shows a more friendly
spirit toward the direct representations
made by the United States.
The American Government is now
pressing for an answer, to the request
that United States army officers be al
lcwed to accompany the Russian field
operations, | but it is explained that
Viceroy -Alexleff, to whom the request
was referred, has not yet replied.
WAR MARS CARNIVAL WEEK.
Carnival week, usually the gayest of
the year in Russia, opened yesterday,
but under the shadow of war the mer
ry-making was only a ghost of that of
former years. In St. Petersburg all of
the festivities, including balls, public
and private functions and fashionable
weddings, planned months in advance,
have been abandoned. Business, how
ever, is as usual suspended and thou
sands of little Finnish sleighs, with
tinkling bells, which for this one week
are allowed to compete with the regular
drosky drivers, whisk people through
the snow-covered streets at cut prices,
although their occupants evidently are
not possessed - by the true carnival
spirit.
The rush of crowds to buy extra
edftions of the newspapers, the intense
activity at the War and Marine Min- 1
istries and the -crowds about the ad
miralty, anxiously inquiring regarding
the fate of relatives, are grim remind
ers of where the thoughts of the peo
ple are. Instead of the customary fes
tivities the theaters gave double per
formances for the benefit of the Red
Cross, and last night the artists' ball,
one of the biggest events of the social
season, which it was intended to aban
don, was held in a hall decorated to
represent the feast day of Benares.
The artists were attired in the garb of
Hindoos, with the object of swelling
1 the Red Cross Society's funds.
ISSUE OF CREDIT NOTES.' â 
An issue of 50.000,000 roubles credit
notes, secured by gold, was made on
February 13. The- comparatively small
Influx of circulating credit notes Into

and the Increased withdrawals for the
Far East are assigned as the reasons
for this operation. The total of the
credit notes in circulation oh February
14 was 680,000,000 roubles.

"It has been decided to hold the Rus

now in the Red Sea and bound, for the
Far East, at Jlbutil. French Somali
land, until further orders. Admiral
Rojdostwenski, chief of the marine
staff, is going to assume the naval
command at Port Arthur. The stop
ping of the Russian squadron at Jibutil
may lead to international complica

port. It is understood that France is
not likely to ask the squadron to leave."
ATTACK ON GERMAN SHIP.
PORT ARTHUR, Monday, Feb. 15.â
The firing on the German cruiser Hah
sa by Japanese warships occurred
while she was proceeding to Port. Ar
thur to take away, the German resi
dents and not when the latter were
on board of her. The Hansa was not
damaged. On her arrival at Port Ar
thur she took on board a number of
wives of Russian sailors and left the
port without/ further incident.
The work of repairing the damaged
Russian battleshlpsjs. progressing rap 1
idly. The Chinese workmen were
panic-stricken by the bombardment,
but they are now working well, regard
less of the "approach of . the Chinese
New Year.
Investigation shows that the city and
fortress were not damaged in the
slightest byMhe. Japanese attack. The
people naturally" are anxious and busi
ness Is at a â¢ complete* standstill, but
the utmost tranquillity prevails.
After the religi6us services on Sun
day there was a military review before
the Viceroy. Admiral Alexieff, who de
nounced the action of the Japanese In
attacking before declaring war" as bar
barous, and expressed confidence that
the Russian soldiers would fully avenge
themselves.
Reports from the interior indicate
that the Cossacks are mobilizing with
great enthusiasm. In the Amur dis
trict they are riding in squads from
village to village, waving Russian flags
and demanding an early chance to meet

D. J. MILLETT CAUGHT
AFTER LONG SEARCH
Man Who Robbed Telephone Com
pany in Columbus, Ohio, in 1902,
Confesses Guilt.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 16.â Since Au
gust, 1902, at the request of the police
department of Columbus, Ohio, peace
officers all over the country have been
looking for D. J. Millett and Katie
Alexander, both, of whom are wanted
on felony charges of embezzlement.
S Millett was captured In a cheap
lodging-house on East Fifth street to
night by Sheriff ,White and admitted
that he was the man wanted and stated
that the woman, whose downfall he had
caused and who fled from .Columbus
with him was In San Francisco. Later
a telegram was received here by the
Sheriff stating that, Katie Alexander
had been arrested there.
For more than eighteen months this
couple had been wandering from city
to city subsisting upon what they had
stolen. Both were employed in Colum
bus by the Citizens' Telephone Com
pany, Millett as assistant cashier and
the Alexander woman as an operator
in the cashier's office. ,
In August, 1902, they suddenly disap
peared, and the information of the of
ficers here Is that he stole $2000, while
the woman took $7300 of the cash be
longjng to the company. All efforts on
the part of the Ohio officers to find
them failed, and the American Bonding
and Trust Company of Baltimore of
fered a reward of $300 for the capture
of the man.
It* was through the efforts of the
Chief of Police at San Jose that the
captures were made. That official
learned. that the couple had been in
that city and that they had separated
there, the man coming south and the
Alexander woman going to San Fran
cisco. Some message passed between
them which was intercepted and
which gave the officers a clew as to
their whereabouts.
Millett arrived here two days ago and
has been spending most of his time in'
his room. He confessed his guilt to
night when arrested, and expressed the
hope tflat the woman would also be ar
rested and gave the officers her San
Francisco address. Later the news of
her arrest was received here. Millett is
willing to return to Ohio without a
requisition.

UNITED STATES MARINES
TO SAIL ON THE BUFORD
War .Department Orders Transport in San Francisco
Harbor to Be Prepared for Immediate Service.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU. HOTEL BARTON,
WASHINGTON, Feb. 16. â The War
Department has instructed Major De
vol, quartermaster of the transport
service at San Francisco, to arrange
to receive on board the transport Bu
ford 600 marines, with accompanying
officers, twenty-two in number. For
what objective point they are intended
has not been given out here. At any
rate they will be landed at San Fran
cisco by the time the Buford is ready
to sail, which will before the end of
the month. Authorities here positive
ly decline to state whether the marines
are intended for the Orient, the
Philippines, or Panama. The orders
are imperative, however, and the Bu
ford is to sail as soon as the marines
can be put aboard.
The transport Buford. which has
been in San Francisco harbor for the
past year or more, was recently com
pletely overhauled and put into sea
going condition. She is now ready to
go to Portland to load lumber and
may sail for that port at any moment.
Major Devol says that the lumber is
intended for Manila, but whether the
marines would board the transport at
Portland or the Buford would come
back to San Francisco to receive them
he was unable to say. The Buford's
capacity will be taxed to the utmost,
both in the cabins and the hold.
The transport Dix, which is loading
5500 tons of oats at Portland, prop
ably will be back here before long, as,
she is to be fitted up to receive 230
mules, which have already been pur
chased and will be received here ready
for shipment on Saturday.

Russian Passports.
A journalist, Prince Metchersky.
sent by the Czar to investigate certain
agrarian troubles, has demonstrated
the absurdity of the passport regula
tions of Russia.
Prince Metchersky crossed to Rou
mania and purposely obtained one of
the permits of the sort required for
taking livestock over the border. He
then went to a Russian frontier post
and presented the document to the
official- in charge as his warrant to
pass. Like many others in similar
positions, the man could read no Rou
manian and little Russian, but he was
duly impressed by the* big. official
looking 'paper! with *its coat of arms
and seal, arid he, readily stuck the
Russian vise on it.
At the end of his investigations
Prince Metchersky returned to Mos- V
cow. When, the opportunity came he
presented the document to the Gov
ernor. "My passport," said he. "I
entered Russia and traveled there five
months on the authority of the doc
ument, Which describes me for, pur
poses of identification in terms which
I think, you will admit are neither
flattering nor true." . . _ .. . â¢ -

Metchersky figured there as a "black

Sixty Thousand

Frontier.
Bar Russian Ad
vance Into
Korea.
LONDON, Feb. 17.â According to spe
cial dispatches published here this
morning from Tokio, the Russian
squadron has returned to Vladivostok.
The Tokio correspondent of the Daily
Mail says in a dispatch that two Rus
sian warships appeared off Okl Island,
in the Southern part of the Japan Sea.
on Sunday.
The correspondent at Chemulpo of
the Dailv Express makes the astonish
ing statement that Japan has already
landed 120,000 troops in Korea, 60,000 of
which are extended along the fighting
front south of the Yalu River.
The London press attaches the great
est significance to the departure of
Viceroy Alexieff from Port Arthur, and
comments upon the sudden throwing of
Russian troops into Nevvchwang as in
dicating Russian apprehensions that
Port Arthur is in danger and that the
Japanese attack may not. after all. be
made where it is expected, on the Yalu.
All reports tend to confirm the impres
sion that Russia has little or nothing to
expect from sea operations.
SUPPLY OF TORPEDOES LOST.
According to a dispatch to the Paris
edition of the New York Herald. 400
torpedoes, being two-thirds of Russia's
entire available supply of these arti
cles, were, destroyed on board the Rus
sian cruiser Variag.
The Tckio correspondent of the Dally
Chronicle cablÂ«Â»Â«> that it is said officially
that several thousand Russian troops
have reached Antung and that it is ru
morea that 20,000 Russians have arrived
at PIngyang, on the Tatons River, in
Central Korea. The Chronicle, how
ever, regards this rumor as improb
able, unless the invasion of Korea pre
ceded the outbreak of hostilities.
The Seoul correspondent of the
Daily Mail, in the course of a descrip
tive narrative of the Chemulpo battle,
says that before the fight the captain
of the Russian cruiser Variag had a
conference with the British, French,
and Italian captains aboard the Brit
ish cruiser Talbot. in which he asked
for the protection of a foreisn war
ship on leaving the harbor. The re-*
quest was refused. The British launch,
delivered ?i protest to the Japanese
admiral immediately before thÂ» ajcp
tion.
AMERICANS HOLD ALOOF.
The Americana present refrained
from attending the naval conference
or partaking in the demonstration, al
though some of the Russian wounded
were received on board the United
States gunboat Vicksburg.
While the Variag was being sunk
her captain, fearins the Japanese
would rearh the vessel before she set
tled down, requested the captain of
the Talbot to fire at her waterline.
This request also was refused.
It is said Great Britain is about to
appoint Consuls at Mukden and An
tung.
In a dispatch, dated Port Arthur.
February 13. a correspondent of the
Times gives a description of seven
Russian warships, which, he says, are
lying disabled there. They include
the battleships Sevastopol and Petro
polavsk. which have not been named
in previous reports of the action. The
correspondent says that altogether
eleven Russian ships were put out of
action at Port Arthur. Continuing, he
declares that the Japanese were
driven from the neighborhood of
Kinchow, near Newchwang, after a
skirmish, in which 150 Japanese were,
taken prisoners and 170 Russians killed.
In an editorial article the Times re
marks that, as this correspondent
does not mention the injuries sustain
ed by the battleships, and as the Kin
chow story has not been reported from
any other source, it would be well to
accept his report with some reserve.

OPERATIONS A FAD.
Public Gradually Awakens to the Fact.
The latest fad in operations has been
the appendicitis fad; before that the
fad for rectal operations (piles, etc.)
held sway. Hundreds of patients were
frightened and hurried into hospitals,
operated upon and robbed of their last
dollar, when the trouble was a simple
case of hemorrhoids or piles only, easily
cured at home with a simple remedy
costing but 50 cents a box.
"I procured one 50-cent box of Pyra-

intention of buying a larger box later.:
but was happily surprised when I found ;
that I was cured, and still have six]
â¢pyramids' left out of the first and only I
box. I â¢have not had the least sign of
piles since I used this one box, which
has been about two months; previous
to using Pyramid Pile Cure I had the
worst kind of bleeding and protruding

the piles, the pain and misery I suf-
fered, u*
"1 am a poor man. but have often said
I would give a fortune, if I had it, tq

"yepepsia destroys all the agreeable
Quaiiues that enter into a man's or
woman's make-up. It is almost a hu-
man impossibility for any one with a
Ke\ere case of dyspepsia to look pleas-
ant. The continuous, miserable, cast-
Â«own feeling is bound to make itself
snown in the appearance and conver-
sation.
iituarfs Dyspepsia Tablets are the
sufferer's certain cure. They are so
recognized all over the world. The
cures they have brought about and
the happiness they have caused and
the suffering they have relieved has
ma.de their name a household word in
all the English-speaking world.
The reason that Stuarts Dyspepsia
Tablets are a certain cure is that they
are a natural cure. There is nothing
to prevent them curing. They con-
tain the essential ingredients of the di-
gestive fluids of the stomach and
simply do the identical work of the
stomach, relieving that weakened
organ and permitting it to rest and
recuperate. Could anything be more
eimple or natural ? They are bound
â¢to cure. They cannot help themselves.
It is just like putting a new stomach
into a man â if that were possible â
and letting the old one go off on a
vacation. Rest is what it needs. Xa-
ture will do her own work of restora-
tion, never fear.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are for
sale by all druggists at 50 cents a box.
Â£1 dru Â£ff is ts means all druggists.
They have become so necessary to the
People that the druggist simply has to
keep them anyway. There are other
remedies that he can make much more
xnoney on if he could sell them, but
he can't. He will not tr.ke chances on
losing his customers by not always
having on hand a BOppljr of Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets.

DESPITE STRONG PROTEST
YOUNG BOY IS RELEASED
Judge Mogan Refuses to Send Lad to Jail as Long as
There Is a Chance of His Becoming Honest â Cabaniss
Has Diogenes Faded â Painful Moment in Fritz's Court
Judge Mogan yesterday positively re
fused to send to Jail 17-year-old Mario
Gorganilo, who pleaded, guilty to two
charges of petty larceny. On two occa
sions he stole brass to the amount of
$17 from the foundry of W. T. Garratt
& Co., at 138 Fremont street. The firm
was exceedingly anxious to have the
t>oy given a severe sentence and pro-r
tested strongly at his release.
Mrs. Raymond, the probationary of
ficer of the juvenile court, requested the
Judge to allow the lad to go on proba
tion. She said that she had thoroughly
Investigated Gorganilo's past record
and his family connections, and as a
result she was satisfied that if the boy
were given another chance he would
lead an honest life. She said that she
had ascertained that the prisoner was
steady and sober and for several years
past had been working and devoting all
his earnings toward the support of his
mother and four younger children.
On this representation the Judge put
the lad on 'probation for two weeks,
and if the reports of his conduct are
satisfactory at the end of that time the
charges will be dismissed. Judge Mo
gan gave the boy some good advice be
fore getting him at liberty.
"If you are a thief," he said, "you
will commit another crime and be back
here, when these present charges will
be considered against you. 1 am un
willing to make a criminal out of a boy
by sending him to jail as long as I
think there is a chance for him to lead
an honest life. I believe this is one of
those cases where the defendant will be
honest In the future. If he is reported
behaving properly at the end of his
probationary period I will dismiss the
charges in order that he may have no
court record against him to affect his
future life."
Judge Cabaniss has beaten out Dioge
nes under a heavy wrap in finding an
honest man. He didn't need a lantern,
either, because across from his resi
dence is a brilliant electric light.
Monday "William Hurley, one of the
toilers of the sea, was before him on a
charge of disturbing the peace. Hurley
was boisterously drunk on the water
front, and when a policeman tried to
quiet him he tried to quiet the police
man. The Judge found the sailor guilty
and fined him $10. Hurley said he had
some money coming to him, and if he
were allowed to be at liberty he would
surely appear in court the following
morning with the amount of his fine.
Judge Cabaniss was awakened from a
deep dream of peace Monday night by a
ring at his doorbell. When he an
swered it he found Hurley without,
holding a glittering $10 piece in his
hand. He had signed to sail early the
r.ext morning, he explained, and would
be unahlo to be in court as agreed, so
he had traveled in the pouring rain
nearly out to the Presidio in the dead
of night to pay his fine. On the strength
of this the Judge cut the fine in two
and gave the honest mariner $5 back.
There was a painful pause in the
grind of justice in Judge Fritz's court
yesterday. Mrs. Abbie Buttermore, who
runs a little grocery on Shipley street,
was on trial for selling liquor without
a license. Policemen Smith and Thomp
son purchased a small bottle of brown
liquid from her and had it in court as
evidence.
"Have you ascertained that this
liquid is whisky?" asked- the Judge.
"No, sir." answered one of the police
men. "I would suggest," said his Hon
or, "that Prosecutor Harris test it and
thus make out his case." Harris pro
tested with tears, because he said he
had promised his dead grandaunt
never to monkey with the demon rum.
Clerk Duffee refused because he said
he was spiritual director of the W. C.
T. U. branch out in his district. Bailiff
Dougherty asked to be excused because
he and Father Mathew had been
schoolmates in Ireland and he was a
charter member of the Temperance
League. Bailiff Jack Conlan took a
long drink of water, choked and said
that water was the strongest he ever
tasted.
The court was finally compelled to
make the policemen taste the contents
of the bottle. They pronounced it
whisky, but of a poor quality, and the
defendant was found guilty. In view
of the fact that she is supporting a
large family she will probably get oft
with a light fine and a heavy scare.

Stella Lester is an actress on the Bar

She was arrested by Policemen Skein

yesterday that three times within a
week she had been on a whizz. "At 5
o'clock yesterday morning," said one

and brought her in. She nearly ran
over Coroner Leland."
"Do you mean to say," asked the

"Oh, no," said the policeman; "that

Pat McKeon, who is director of

Fourth and Fifth streets, near Harri

terday, charged with assault with a
deadly weapon. Liego G. Bacigalupi
avers that McKeon refused to fee4 the
complaining witness' team and when
remonstrated with struck him over the
head with a pitchfork.
The defendant displayed a fine rich
biogue when he testified in his own
defense. "1 wouldn't give him any feed,
yanner," said McKeon, "because he
wouldn't pay up. Then he abused me
shamefully. Why, a man wouldn't use
that kind of language to a gun-dog.
I didn't hit him with the steel part of
the fork, but only gave him a rap with
the handle."
Judge Cabaniss took the matter un
der advisement and will probably see
his way clear to reducing the charge
to simple battery.
George Sprengel, the sea captain,
who shot two French sailors about a
month ago on Drumm street in the
belief that they were attempting to
hold him up, was given a preliminary
hearing yesterday before Judge Con-
Ian. The two wounded men testified
that the shooting was without the
slightest provocation, i
Sprengel, in his own defense, said
that a week before the occurrence his
mate had been attacked by footpads.
As he attempted to pass four men, two
of whom were the complaining wit
nesses, he imagined they were at
tempting to surround him and he fired
upon them accordingly.
His attorney, Tom O'Connor, stated
that at present his client was without
means, but if he could regain his
liberty he could secure command of a
vessel bound for the South Seas. On
his return he promised to make satis
factory money compensations to the
injured men for his fict, which, the at
torney said, had been shown to be
more of an error in judgment than a
premeditated crime. The Judge took
the case under advisement until to
morrow.

BASSETT TAKES
GAS FOR LOVE
Streetcar Conductor Leaves
the World Because His
Sweetheart Had Jilted Him
Disappointed In love, John B. Bas-
Bctt, alias John Bentley, a conductor
on the Ook-stfeet car line, suffocated
himself with illuminating gas last
Monday night in his room at 351
Pierce street. His landlady, Mrs. F.
Steen, discovered him dead in his bed
yesterday forenoon, with one 'end of a
rubber tube In his mouth and another
affixed to the gas burner, the stopcock
of which was fully turned on.
Several notes written in pencil by
Bassett were found on a table. One,
addressed to "Fanny," reads as fol
lows:
February 15, 1904â My Only Sweetheart: I
have irrieved these last two weeks until my
heart Is broken, and to-day, when I heard the
news, put the finishing touches on the whole
business. Don't believe I ever said one wrong
word against you, for I never have. Forgive
my soul, Fanny, for all the harsh things I
'ever said to you. It was only because' I
loved you and because the good Lord told me
there was somethlnjr wrong. Tou told me
when I was at Handley'Â« you could not live
without me. But It Is different now, and I
i can't live without you. Well, good-by, my
darling, and roy last wish Is, Go home and
never come to Frisco again.
>ACK BASSETT.
Fanny, get the watch and remember me
by It.
The following was addressed to a
man named Ray:
2â15â04: Well, Ray. I suppose by the
time you receive this note you will have ac
complished something that Is my death. But
I forgive you, Ray, and may God bless you
both. Carry out my instructions, and as
long as you have done it, be good to her. for
she Is the best little woman In this world.
BASSETT.
Another note, evidently intended for
"Fanny," was addressed to Hammer
smith & Field and was an order to de
liver to the bearer Bassetfs- watch.
But it was signed J. B. Bentley. On
the back of a young woman's photo
graph were these words: "Sweetheart
Fanny â I love you more than you will
ever know." . .
Bassett was 30 years old.
Mrs. Phillips' Will Is Filed.
The 'will of Mrs. May E. Phillips,
who died recently at 2004 . Gough
street, was filed for probate yesterday.

neighborhood of $100,000. To her
husband, J. "W. Phillips, she leaves
$20,000 and a life interest in the fam
ily residence on Gough street; to her
sister, Anna J. Breed, $10,000, and to
her brottier, D. F. Blunt of Llvermore,
Me., $10,000 and the ranch he nov.'
lives on. She also leaves $5000 eaÂ»h
to her five nephew^ and nieces, 1\ E.
Drew of San Jose. Laura Whitaker of
Ferndale, Lillian M. Moore of this
city and Leon, Guy and Gladys Blunt
of Livermore. Me. She also ; leaves
$6500 to a number of friends and dis
tant relatives. After the payment of
the legacies the residue of the estate
is to go to her brother and the neph
ews and nieces.
Makes Grave Charge.
In an affidavit, filed yesterday by
Eliza A. Button, administratrix of the
estate . of D. R. Thomas, who is the
plaintiff. in a suit against L. P., H. G.
and W. B. Thomas and Alice and W.
M. Swett, she asks that the trial of
the suit be delayed for r a month or
until such time as .her husband, R.
W. Button, .returns from Milwaukee.
She says he is a material witness in
the case and that she can prove by his
testimony that at the time mentioned
in her complaint Thomas had himself
declared insolvent and that for the
purpose of defrauding his creditors he
had transferred to the defendants his
property.
Bunko Steerer Sentenced.
The motion for a new trial in the
case of George Roberts, convicted of
grand larceny, was denied by Judge
Lawler yesterday and the prisoner
was sentenced'to serve nine and a half
years in San Quentin. Last March
Roberts got $S0 from W. A. Perry,
who was enticed into a room at 1044
Market street, where there were sev
eral bunko men. The door was lock
ed and Perry, in fear, gave the pris
oner the money demanded.

OREGON CORONER TELLS
A VERY PECULIAR STORY
Says the Rody of Charles Fellows
\V:>s Delivered on Order of Two
Total Stranjjers.
J. P. FMnley, Coroner of Multnomah
County, Or., complained to Coroner
Leland yesterday that he had" been
shabbily treated by Undertaker Suhr,
who had obliged him to pay $30
charges on the body of Charles Fel
lows, who died on January 20. Fel
lows' parents reside In Oregon and are
unacquainted in San Francisco. Their
son came to this city on his way home
from Los Angeles, whither he had
gone to be treated for consumption,
and died here. Mr. Finley telephoned
the Coroner to hold the body of Fal
lows until he should arrive hereto
take it back to Oregon. He was sur
prised to find that Suhr had it ami
when he demanded to know how Suhr
came to have possession he was in
formed that the body had been de
livered upon a written order signed
by "J. R. Richards" and "Mark
Strouse," room 26 Mills building.
Coroner Finley said that those per
sons were total strangers to the fam
ily and had no authority to give an
order for the body. Suhr charged
Finley $30 for having embalmed and
cared for the corpse, which sum Fin
ley paid, taking Suhr's receipt.
Neither Richards nor Strouse could
be seen yesterday afternoon. Coroner
Leland has begun an Investigation of
the matter.

CLAIMS THALL. WAS NOT
INTERESTED IN ALCAZAR
In an affidavit filed yesterday by
Maurice E. Meyer, executor of the
will of the late Mark Thall, in oppo
rition to the motion made by Thall's
son and daughter to reopen the estate
on the ground that they had discov
ered evidence that their father had an
interest in the Alcazar and Central
theaters, which was not credtited to
his estate, he states that the claim of
the Thall children is not based on
facts. He denies that Thall was a
partner with himself and Fred Belasco
in the Alcazar and Central theaters.
Meyer avers that the motion to re
open the Thall estate is not made in
good faith and says there exists no
ground for the charge that Thall was
cheated out of any interest in the two
theaters. He says that during the
time the Thall estate was being pro
bated he frequently consulted with
the attorney for the Thalls and says
that the latter knew the theatrical
man was not interested in the Alcazar
and Central.

MAKES STRANGE
USE OF CURIO
AlanuMfla Magistrate Affixes Of
ficial Seal of Filipino Gen

LEXGTHY DEMURRER FILED
Justice Tappan Fails to Make
Distinction Between. Proper
State Insignia and a Relic
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
111S Broadway. Feb. 16.
The sending out of a freak copy of a
summons in a divorce action by Justice
of the Peace Tappan of Alameda is the
subject of a three-page demurrer filed
with the courts to-day. Opposing coun
sel to Tappan seriously objects to hav
ing: his client summoned into court un
der the seal of some defunct Fili
pino magnate, whose coat-of-arms has
fallen a prey to the curio hunter.
The document speaks for itself and
only needs the demurrer of Attorney J.
Meyer to point out the glaring incon
gruity of the alleged paper through the
process of which Tappan was attempt
ing to do business in the courts here.
Meyer states that the copy served on
his client does not bear the seal of the
Superior Court of the county of Ala
meda, nor of any court of the United
States, but, on the contrary, bears a
seal purporting to be that of the "Capi
tania General de Filipinas Estada
Mayor."
The unusual summons promises to
upset the gravity of the bench when
called to its attention. It begins with
the usual formal printed greeting of
the people of the State of California to
George Molitor and commanding him,
under the seal of the court, to appear
upon a certain date and answer an ac
tion begun against him. Then comes
the seal. Instead of being round, as
State Nseals are made, it is of oval pat
tern. Around the border is the insignia
of the captain general of the Philip
pines. On its face there is a shield sur
mounted with a crown, and on the field
of the shield are lions rampant, with
ostrich feathers in its center.
Meyer has given notice that he will
make a motion to quash and set aside
the service of the summons on account
of its irregularity.

DECIDE PISTOL
WAS HARMLESS
Jury Acquits John Carlson
for Making a "Gun Play,"
as Weapon Was Unloaded
MIGHT HAVE. BEEN- -SHOT
Frank Fa "â¢an, the' Complain
ing- Witness, Files Two More
Charges Against His Assailant
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Feb. 16.
A jury to-day acquitted John Carl
son of Berkeley of the charge of as
sault to commit murder, the evidence
going to show that the weapon was not
loaded at the time the accused was
making his "gun play." Two pther
charges, one of carrying a concealed
weapon and another of disturbing the
peace, have been lodged against him,
and he is not yet free from his entan
glement with the law. .
Carlson was accused by Frank Fa-
Ran, who conducts an electrical shop in
Berkeley, of attempting his life. The
men Quarreled because Fagan was do
ing some work that under union regula
tions should have been done by an ap
prentice. As a union man Carlson ob
jected and was discharged by Fagan.
A quarrel then ensued, and Carlson
took a pistol out of his pocket and won
a temporary victory.
The Judge in commenting on a cer*
tain portion of Carlson's trial said that
a man who was fool enough to draw
an unloaded weapon and take the
chance of being shot was probably not
resourceful enough to get the cartridges
out of the pistol without detection.

ACCEPTS PLAN
Consents ; to â¢ Meet and Con

BEAKS ON: THE FUTURE
People of Oakland^ May Look
'' for an Official Statement
. Within the Next Few Days
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Feb. 16.
Mayor Warren Olney has consented
to act with the. special committee from
the City Council in selecting a board
of appraisers to pass upon the value
of the plant of the Contra COsta Water
Company, at least for the fixing of wa
ter rates. -Whether the action of this
board of appraisers will be used beyond
the mere fixing of water rates will
have to be determined in the future. ';
There was a meeting of the special
bond and water committee of the City
Council with Mayor Olney on Saturday
evening, at which the committee sub
mitted to the Mayor the report that
was presented to the Council last even
ing. At the same time the Council com
mittee requested Mayor- Olney to act
with it in the selection of an expert to
appraise theÂ«value of the plant of
Contra Costa Water Company in behalf
of the city. Mayor Olney to-night out
liticd his position with regard to this
very delicate question:
I have consented to act with the special
committee from the City Council in the con
sideration of an expert who will represent â  the
Interests of the city of Oakland. I consider
that the plan proposed Is an excellent one as
far as the fixing of the water rates for the
present year Is concerned, but whether it will
go beyond this to the plan proposed by the
Council committee will have to be determined.
As I understand the proposition, this board of
appraisers is to fix a value upon the plant of
tlje Contra Coata Water Company for the es
tablishing of water rates for the present year.
If it is decided expedient to po beyond Jhis It
can be done, but no definite decision has been
reached upon this point. I shall issue a full
statement in a few days, and until that time
comes you can say that I am In favor cf the
plan for the fixing 1 of water rates for the pres
ent year. .
SAYS LIFE WAS
ALL A FAILURE
Well-Dressed Stranger Takes
Koomat Pacific House and
"Commits Suicide by Gas
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Feb. 16.
After writing a note'stating that his
life had been a failure, a well dressed,
unknown man last night, committed
suicide at the Pacific Lodging-houBe,
869 Washington street, by inhaling Illu
minating gas through a tube attached
to a gas jet. He was a man of appa
rent education and refinement. He took
the room last night, and was not discov
ered until 5:30 o'clock this evening,
when he was found by Mrs. E. Price,
proprietor of the house. The prepara
tions for the suicide were taken with
much care. There were no marks on
the clothing or elsewhere which would
serve for identification. In the note the
dead man asked that his remains be not
held for identification. Save for the
fact that he confessed that his life had
been a failure there is no explanation
of the suicide. He was a man about
five feet six inches tall, weighing prob
ably 150 pounds. His hair was dark
and inclined to curl. His nose was
straight, but gave the impression of be
ing slightly turned up. The clothes
worn by the deceased were of good ma
terial. The coat was dark. The vest
was a pepper color. His trousers were
dark striped ones.
On a thin watch chain there was a
small locket shaped like a heart. It
was set in the back with a diamond.
The locket did not open. This is the
best mark of identification found on the
dead man. In a memorandum book
were found these names: S. J. Mc-
Kenny, W. H. Short, Co. H., Cater
Novelty Company, Kokomo, Ind.

UNIVERSITY EVENTS
BERKELEY. Feb. 16.â There is a hitch In
the Labor day plans and it will take a tele
gram to President Wheeler, who Is now In the
East, to straighten out the tangle. It seems
that when he went away President Wheeler
told the students that they could draw upon a
certain fund for. any necessary expenses at
tendant upon Labor day. But when Max The
len, president or the Associated Students, went
to lock for the fund the other day he could
not find It. Now he Will have to dispatch a
telegram to President Wheeler and await a
reply. There will be some delay, but It Is not
expected that the whole affair, plans for which
are almost complete, will be blocked.

J. Gustav, White, editor of the Dally Cali

the presence of women. In an editorial this
morning. the editor says: 'There Is some Just
ground for the complaint against the way men
smoke about the campus. Such seems to be a
quite prevalent sentiment among' numerous
women students who read 'our good mother's"
criticism. Laying aside the question as to the
harm â or the good, one. should say â of the ex
cessive emoklng. let us aek another quenllon:
Does It show a lack of. good breeding for men
to smoke in North Hall corridors, when those
corridors are used by women students as much
as men? We ask' for Information."
The building and grounds committee of- the
Board of Regents has* awarded the contract

Arrangements have been made by which

WITNESSES TELL. IIOW THEY
FOUND MISS CIjARK'S BODY
Say Room Was Orderly When Dis

Her Life Was Made.
At the hearing of the contest of the
will of the late Isabella D. Clark yes
terday in the Probate Court Margaret
Whitlow, Mattie Schmidt, Henry J.
Kessel and Dr. W. H. McNutt were the
witnesses examined. The two first
named testified that they, while em
ployes of the McNutt Hospital, where
Miss Clark committed suicide, found
her Jbody. They said the room was in
a very orderly condition when the dis
covery was made that the patient had
taken her own life. Kessel's testi
mony was to the effect that he, while
employed at the hospital as a man-of
all-work, saw Miss Clark frequently.
He said he took particular notice that
she always had a stare in her eyes and
that she answered his inquiries and
those of other persons with a simple
"yes" or "no."
, Dr. 'McNutt ...was not put on the
stand until late in the afternoon, just
a few minutes before the case was
put over until this morning. He tes-
tlned simply to the location of Miss
Clark's room. : .

PLAN CAMPAIGN
FOR THE BONDS
Citizens' Civic Committee
Proposes to* Educate Popu
lace Upon - Needs* of Town
TChVX TRUSTEES TO DECIDE
People Will Vote Separately
Upon the Items in the Pro
posed Issue for Municipality
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call.
2148 Center Street, Feb. 16. .
Now that the citizens* bond commit
tee has completed its report and taken
steps to present (t to the Board of
Trustees the campaign for the election
of the bonds will begin. Chairman J.
W.' Richards was authorized last night
to appoint an executive committee,
consisting of one committeeman from
each ward, with authority to call
meetings and gather subscriptions to
pay for them.' A campaign of educa
tion will then be waged for at least
a month before the bonding issue
comes to a vote.
It is not expected that the people
will give a two-thirds vote to all of
the items included in the proposed
bonding issue, calling for the expendi
ture'of $317,000. The people will be
permitted to vote upon such things as
they believe necessary for the town
and naturally a number of the items
will be rejected. It is generally con
ceded that the items caliing for $7000
for street improvements, $35,000 for
Fire Department and $125,000 for
schools will carry- Such items as
$10,000 for parks,, $20,000 for manual
training, $45,000 for West Berkeley
wharf and $75,000 for a Town Hall
may be looked upon by the voters as
not altogether necessary just at this
time.
It rests with the Board of Trustees
to say whether an item calling for
$160,000 for sewer reconstruction
shall be inserted in the proposed
bonding issue. As the work could be
done with more facility and less hard
ship upon the taxpayers by the district
plan it is likely that the work will be
done that way. The most telling argu
ment against incorporating it into a
bond Issue is that it would amount to
double taxation for the people of
South Berkeley, who only recently
paid for a sewer for their district.
Victor Robertson of the sub-com
mittee on Fire Department -suggested
a way to do away with the extra cost
of maintenance, while the bonds for
the department were being discussed
last night. His pjan is to purchase
automobile apparatus, so that there
will be no bills for feed, horses and
repairing.

WORKMEN FIND
POT OF GOLD
Rusty Tomato Can, Dislodged
From Foundation of House,
Yields $1500 in Yellow Coin
DIVIDED AMONG THKEE
Some One Remembers That
' the Strncture Was One Time
Inhabited by an Aged Miser
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
HIS Broadway. Feb.- 18.
A mass of bright $20 gold pieces pour
ing from an old rusty tomato can
which had been dislodged from beneath
the foundation of a house that was
being raised was the sight which greet
ed the astonished gaze of three work
men In the employ of Housemover
Walter Suell this morning while they
were at work on a Bouse located at
1420 Eleventh street, which is owned
by John Pateus.
The Instant that the men realized
that it was not a fancy, but that the
coin was actually before them, there
was a wild scramble for the gold, and
the housemovers fairly fell over each
other in their efforts to secure a share
of the money. When all the gold in
sight had been recovered the work
men compared notes and it was found
that the can had contained $1500. How
much each of the men got is not
known.
John Pateus, the present owner of
the house, recently purchased the lot
and -building from James Qulnlan and
knows nothing of how the money came
to be hidden where it was found. He
says that as the men found it he is
not going to bother them, as he ha3
lost nothing. The house is occupied by
H. R. Dill, who has only lived there
a short time and knows nothing of the
previous owners.
James Quinlan. who formerly owned
the house, is an ex-police officer of this
city. He could not be found to-day,
but some of the neighbors say that
before he bought the house it was
owned by an old man named King,
who was of miserly habits, although
he was reported to be wealthy, and it
is supposed that, fearing to trust his
money in the bank, ha concealed it
beneath the house and &a he was-~very
old forgot it when he left. The truth
of the matter will probably never be
known, as no one knows what has be
come of King, but It is thought he is
dead.
It matters little -who hid the canful
of gold, as the workmen who dug. It
up are probably the only ones who
will receive, any benefit fron. the
hoarded wealth.

Glitterinp Decora
tions Charm the
Eye.
Mimic Royalty Re
ceives Its Due
Homage.
The Mardi Gras of 1904 has passed
into history, and it will stand out
among its fellows as the smartest ex
travaganza that smart San Francisco
has ever gaped at.
When in the history of the Temple
on the Hill was it ever robed bo gor
geously, or bejeweled so prodigally?
The house galleryâ the shrine of the
acblest art we know â was studded with
sepphire, emerald and ruby lights;
Turkish rugs that bore the breath of
perfumed harems hung from the walls
between the pictures, and garlands,
pr^en and fragrant, hung from the
noble arches. From the center of the
dome hung a huge ball of gold, and
upon it hovered queerish things of the
t-crth and of the sea â butterflies and
poppies, lizards and creepy things â
things that belong to Hobgoblin land.
The Maple room, in which the grand
march fell into form, was alluring as
a woodland glen with ferns and palms
and pink begonias. Here Bacchante,
Earland-wound. smiled a seductive
smile to the motley crowd, as it surged
toward the Searles gallery â the Mecca
of the merry maskers.
In the gallery, under a canopy of
violet and gold, begemmed with count-
Ws lanterns â red and yellow â its walls
of foliage studded with huge red pop
pies of Munchausen growth, hen?, ah,
here, was the picture â a picture that
lurks in the mind as a passing pageant
of the world's strange peoples.
There! the lights go down. The
trumpet blows a gladsome note, and
Henry Heyman raises his little stick.
The ball is on! Behold, the rainbow is
loosed from somewhere In the gallery,
when streams of ruby light, then green,
then violet, fall upon the moving
figures, grave and gay â mostly gayâ
f"r even the monks were unseemly gay.
and then the dance â the swerving,
swirling dance â was on.
The Egyptian pageant, with its
mighty Pharaoh at its headâ (what a
stunning king Newton J. Tharp really
would make) and its beauteous god
do?.Â«. Isis. she who feeds the sacred
stork? â that was the feature of distinc
1 ion. Isis was portrayed by Miss Klaine
'-ioodrich of Jx>s Angeles, who, be it
known, sat goddess-like on her gilded
throre, while yet it lay upon a trem
bling basi?; the bearers of the fajr Isis.
however, bore her safely to her sacred
1 1; rone â and with no bones broken â
where she proceeded to hold high court
with her devotc-d subjects.
Egypt Lives Again
ar)d Iris Is pair
For a tim<Â» Egypt lived again. The
sob of the Nile was near, but silently
','ortrayed in oils. But her men and
maidens, how brave they were, and
how fair!
Isis, the lovely goddess, far out
shone her lesser sisters, they who
were not born of the fuii; but when
Fhe had stepped from her dais then
it was that her rivals closed in around
her and her glory became one with
theirs.
Mrs. Peter Martin undoubtedly was
thr> regnant daughter of the Xile. Who
will forget those luxuriant braids en
twined with pearls that framed her
laJr face?
As for the king, Pharoah I â to-day
)i|HJn Newton J. Tharp â his splenflid
lobe befitted his rank; but some un
imaginative scamp was heard to re
mark that the king's headpiece was
built like a stein, which remark made
the king and his courtiers very thirsty.
Miss Ethel Hager burst upon the
startled vision of the onlookers in a
black gauzy gown of a toe dancer,
which, by the way. she is in truth, and
made one of the sensations*of a sensa
tional night.
The splendor of the Egyptian pa
grant was due largely to the indefat
igable efforts of Captain Fletcher, A.
Altmann, president of the .Student's
Association of the School of Design:
Jiobert Sprague. Mr. Duncan. Mr. Tur
ner. Mr. Cummings, Mr. Xahl, Miss
McElroy, Miss Mount and hosts of
other artist workers.
The decorations, so marvelouslv
well planned, were in sole charge of
John M. Gamble and Harry W. Sea
well.
Gay Parties pill

The boxes were gay with stunning
women and their men folk when the
bugle sounded the note for the dance.

Kidney Trouble
WHEN* BECOMES CHRONIC AND
SERIOL'S; up to the discovery of
Fulton's Compounds the kidneys were
very little Influenced by medicines. This
is susceptible of proof. Let us explain:
Kidney diseases may be divided into two
great classes, viz.. those that get well
of themselves and those that llr-jrer
(chronic), the latter being declared in-
curable. â  /â¢-
Durinsr the first few weeks kitlr.-.-y
disorders commonly get well with caret
both with and without treatment. Cut
in the second or chronic stage they r.rrO
incurable, resisting all known trc:stÂ«
ment. It is in the first class in which
they often get well of themselves that
the records of cures have been made Ly
popular medicines. Uut in the great
second class or lingering form (com-
monly referred to by physicians aa
Bright's disease) there was no record of
cures till Fulton's Renal Compound wa.i
discovered. Tnder its influence about $7
per cent of the chronics now yield.
The question here arises in thr read-
er's mind, "Is my kidney trouble in tlie
first or second stage?" This is the test
â if the kidney trouble is found to havo
continued after the cold, sickness or tirst
exciting cause has disappeared it is in
the second or chronic stage. In many
cases where lingering kidney trouble
cannot be traced to any causo it is
chronic with the very first symptom, the
real cause being so remote thu.t it can-
not be connected.
If you have any kidney trouble what-
ever start right. Treat it seriously be-
taking Fulton's Renal Compound for
Bright's disease. People are sending
across the continent for this compound.
Some late reports from supposed in-
curable cases are as follows: J. . J.
Sehott & Co. of Galveston. Tex., report
the recovery of D. R. Hawkins of l.Vi3
Twenty-second street, that city. Dr.
Emily Noble reports from the same
city a patient of hers as recovering.
Charles A. Newton, yardmaster of the
S. P. R. R. Co. of Sacramento, reports
the complete recovery of his son after
the doctors said he could never be well
again. K. T. Snow of 1S15 Columbia

sicians putting cases on it.

In our last lesson the starting point
of the breath in singing was the sub
ject of my explanation. Now (taking
It for granted that the pupil has been
practicing his breathing exercises
faithfully in the meantime) we will
take up an exercise by means of which
he is to accomplish his first singing
tone.
Go to the piano, and, -with the boy
IMAGINARY CIRCLE DE
SCRIBED BY TONE.
Standing beside you, play the note D
that is to be found on the fourth line
of the "FtanV I choose this note be
cause it is neither too high nor too low
for the ordinary child's voice. It is
w ell to train a child to sing moderate
ly high, in order to avoid so-called
â¢throaty" tones, and yet one must be
tareful not to strain the vocal chords
by taking the voice too high at first.
Now let the child sing ""ah" on the
rote D. In doing this he should first
inhale a breath slowly, then as slow
ly let it out again, and as the breath
Marts upward and out he must use it
to make the sound "ah" on the note D.
Just as soon as the pupil is able to
do this with eaFe, that is, to start the
breath invariably from the proper

STARTING POINTS OF
BREATH AND TONE.
place (as explained in the previous
lesson) and to give forth a clear, free
tone w hen he says "ah." we must make
the exercise a little less simple. This
tÂ«me his breath is to come from the
rilaphragrm in just the way that it did
before, but he must turn his thought
to the height of the tone and start the
pound mentally from the top of his
head.
The higher a note is "placed" the
sweeter and more round it will be,
and the pupil must, as he studies these
exercises, try to "think" the note as
high a.s possible. In this way a free,
clear, relaxed passage will be made
from the diaphragm to head, through
which the breath and resultant Found
can travel unimpeded.
It is most desirable to obtain this free
1 ai-sage, for nothing is more unpleas
ant to listen to than a ' # throaty" voice â
in other words, a voice where the tones
brgin and end in the throat, and a flat,
choked -up tone fs the result. A
â¢throaty" voice is, of course, very lim
ited in its capabilities, and any ten
dency on the pupil's part to sing in this
way must be corrected at once. It is
nothing more nor less than rigid mus
cles instead of the perfect relaxation
so necessary if happy results are to be
expected. Every muscle, from the pu
pil's diaphragm to the top of the head,
should be absolutely relaxed. To aid in
this let him try to imagine that the
tone he emits describes a circle â the
larger the better. <You will understand
what I mean by the illustration.) This
circle starts as his mouth opens, and
the tone is carried up, up, up, coming
down gradually on the other side as it
follows the line of the circle. This is a
simple exercise, but ft will be found of
preat use in placing a child's voice, for
the imagination plays as important a
I part hero as it does in the study of
piano technique.
The pupil must now begin to place
the tone at the top of the head at the
same moment that he places the breath
at his diaphragm. One smarts up as the
other starts down. They meet at the
front of the mouth (just back of the
front teeth), and by their meeting a
musical note is made. Instead of stand^
ing still on the threshold, so to speak,
the sound is borne out into the room
I by means of the imaginary circle just
described, and the wider the circle the
! better "placed" will be the note. In
other words, the more freedom the pu
pil is able to acquire the better, clearer,
sweeter tone will his vocal chords give
forth.
The pupil must be careful not to push
the breath, but to let it come naturally,
oven if the sound is very small and
thin at first. That is of very little mo
; ment, for the voice will strengthen rap-
J Idly with practice, and the only Im
j portant thing at first is to acquire
' sweetness and purity of tone, letting
j the rest come afterward. If the pupil is
' forcing the breath you can easily detect
1 it. for as he starts to expel the breath
j he will probably say "ha" Instead of
' '"ah" in that case, and the difference in
I tone will be apparent at once. Remem
ber, too, that the voice must always
j come out and never go toward the back
j of the throat.
We will now take up an exercise de-
I signed to promote freedom and flexi
i bility of tone. The pupil must start on
; D once more, but this time he is to sing
: three notes in one breath, instead of one
; as before. He is to go from D to E and
i back to D a painâ in other words, he is
'< to sing D. E, D.
The moment he has struck D his
i mind must travel to E: in other words,
! he must "think ahead." as he has been
' taught to do when reading piano music.
i The method is the same in both cases,
i but the Idea in singing is to "place"
! the note before it is actually struck;
j that is, to find out as soon as possible
j where the note is to go. to place the
i tone in the mind, and so to be ready :
; for the voice when the time comes to
actually strike the note.
After a short time this will all hap
pen naturally and without any con
i scious thought whatever on the part
! of the child. It is merely mental
i "reading at sight," and requires no ef- :
I fort whatever, as soon as the pupil
: becomes accustomed to singing in this
: way.
Now we will take up a third and more
lengthy exercise. This begins, as did
! the others, with D. The pupil must
1 sing first D, then E. then D, then E
again. After this he should take a
: breath and repeat the exercise. Next
'he does exactly. the same thing on the
j two notes C and D. repeating this part
! of the exercise as he did the first part.
I Next he must try it on B and C, then
A and B, and finally on G and A,
I thus going through the compass of five
j notes and so completing the exerclae.
'â¢ Between each group of notes the breath
] should be taken, but as lightly as pos
â  sible, so that the exercise may run
I smoothly from beginning to end.
As the exercise descends the pupil
â  should endeavor to keep "thinking
\ high" â in fact, the lower the notes go
! the higher he should try to think to
i keep his tones high and pure. The idea
j is to gradually bring all his notes to
j the same level, so that one shall be in
quality exactly like another, as are the
notes of a violin or piano. I hope I
make mvself perfectly plain. When I
! say that one note should be just like
I another I do not of course refer to the
differences In tone required to bring
out the proper amount of feeling and
expression â of course there are "head"
tones and "chest" tones, "covered"
tones, "crying" tones, and so on, ad in
finitum; but with all these (with the
j exception of the head tones) we havo
i nothing to do just now. We are merely
j getting the voice ready to sing, as we
] prepared the fingers for playing, and
I the first and most necessary thing of
ail is to teach the' pupil to know how to
manage his voice so that one note shall
be just as good as another, and so that
that which is the quality of his best
note at the beginning shall become the
quality of all his notes as time goes on.
The "thinking ahead" process will
help him to acquire a legato, singing
j tone in just the way that It does when
i playing the piano. If he wishes to
j take a note an octave higher than the
one he has just sung, his mind,
brought first to the note in question
and firmly placed on it, will place the
tone thereon twice as easily as it
could be done in any other way.
Another point to remember is this:
The higher the note is the deeper the
breath should be. The pupil should
strive always to start the breath deep
er and deeper, the tone higher and
j higher, and to widen always the clr
i cle of sound, as explained earlier in
j the lesson.
The last exercise that I described
is in its complete form D, E, D, E, D,
then C, D, C, D, C, then B, C, B, C, B,
then A, B, A, B, A and finally G, A,
G, A. G.
This should be sung as given In the
Illustration, and as the pupil tries it
strike a chord occasionally on the
piano, to be sure that he is keeping
exactly on the key. Do not play for
him all the time, howaver, as he must
learn to carry the different "inter
vals" in his mind and so acquire a true
sense of pitch.
After each trial of the exercise let
him rest a bit, bo that he may begin
operations with perfectly relaxed
throat muscles. Do not keep him at
voice practice more than five or ten
minutes at a time at first, as the vocal
chords are extremely delicate and eas
ily strained. :*>;; *-

OAKLAND BONDS.
OUR â¢ lively arid ambitious neighbor, Oakland, is
awakening to her opportunity. The City Coun
cil has decided upon a bond issue of $3,500,000,
of which $1,110,000 is for additional schoolhouses. That
item is not only creditable but significant. It shows that
the population has far outgrown existing school accom
modations. The public schpols of Oakland enjoy a dis
tinction beyond those of any other city in the United
States. - They possess a completely equipped astronomi
cal observatory, donated by the late Anthony Chabot, in
which physical and mathematical astronomy may be
studied, with the use of telescopes and other instru
ments.
The Bond issue also devotes $150,000 to the equip
ment of a polytechnic school, which is in line with the
latest developed necessity of the school system. In it
pupils will be taught the essentials of all mechanical
training, and may learn the handicrafts in all their de
tails. The progress of juvenile incorrigibility in the
country is traced to the lack of training in the handi
crafts. To that lack we owe the creation of the juvenile
courts and other devices for restraining the tendencies of
youth which have their origin in idleness. A polytech
nic school has become a necessity in all large cities, and
Oakland will get most favorable results from trie one
which the bond issue will create.
In another respect the Council has been mindful of the
health and good order of the city. It is proposed to
create a park system in the foothills, supplemented'by
plazas and children's playgrounds in different parts of
the city. One of these is located on the filled ground ( in
West Oakland, where it is in sight from the main line of
the railroad. That part of Oakland has for years done
much harm to the whole city by its unsightliness. It is
to be hoped that this new playground will serve as a
nucleus for the transformation of the whole marsh into
a park, causing the removal of the garbage dumps and
every offensive feature.
No city in the Union is as favorably situated as Oak
land to receive the adornments of art. The climate
leaves nothing to be desired, and the good taste shown
by private citizens in architecture and the adornment of
lawns and borders has always been most commenda
ble. It has long been a proper subject of complaint
that public enterprise has lagged behind. The determi
nation of the present city government to catch up with
the procession in that respect will cause it to be long re
membered by the people.
San Francisco appreciates the function of Oakland in
aiding this larger city to retain here the commercial su
premacy which is of so much importance to California.
There is a limit to the capacity of our water front to
accommodate trade. Though that limit has not yet been
reached, it may well be. Then will arise the question of
diversion of trade elsewhere. San Francisco should give
to Oakland all support necessary in securing harbor fa
cilities and dock room, to the end that our ample bay
may continue to attract the fleets of the world. We are
sure that the municipals-authorities of Oakland appre
ciate the importance of this view, and if need be will
show in that respect the same awakening enterprise^ that
is in the bond issue for the purpose of enlarging school
facilities and securing parks.
Another important feature in the bond issue is the ap
propriation for a ne>v City Hall. A man is known by the
house and its surroundings in which he lives. He owes
it to the community to make these the best he can, in
proportion to his means. If this be a private duty, how
much more is it a public duty, in the government of a
city, to house its administration well and properly. The
Oakland City Hall has long been an eyesore. It looks
like the stepdaughter of the San Francisco custom
house, and with such a stepmother what could be ex
pected? In the basement is' a noisome jail that affects
the Board of Health, and violates the constitution by in
flicting cruel and unusual punishment upon prisoners-
The building is blistered like the lips of an ague patient,
and its exterior would be improved 03' painting it over
with patent medicine and tobacco signs, after the fashion
of country barns. The amount proposed in the bond
issue for a new City Hall will erect a proper building,
with nobility of architecture suited to a city of the rank
and dignity of Oakland.
In all of these proposed improvements San Francisco
takes as lively and friendly an interest a^ if they were
her own. In this there is no disposition to treat Oak
land as a suburb of this city. We salute her as our com
ing equal in all things. Her progress in no sense im
pedes ours, but is an essential part 6f it. San Francisco
wants no dead neighbors, but requires that they all be
alive and strong, working for the general progress by
working for their own. In the bond campaign it will
surely be the pleasant duty of The Call to urge its read
ers in Oakland to go forward, with the assurance that the
experience gained by the proper expenditure of the
avails of the issue now proposed will incite them to fur
ther efforts until they secure for themselves the most at
tractive, healthful and impressive city of its size on the
continent.
A San Jose woman wedded her deceased husband's
brother the other day in order not to risk losing in a
$1000 breach of promise suit which he had instituted
against her. The man in the case can now certainly fix
at least his maximum monetary value in the eyes of his
spouse.
AN HONEST MAN.
THE whole country is 1 impressed and the public
morality is vastly improved by the highly honora
ble course pursued' by Mr. Shafroth of Colorado,
who voluntarily surrendered his seat in Congress, after
himself discovering that his election was tainted by
fraud. His seat was contested pn the ground of fraud.
His Republican opponent agreed with him that the bal
lots should be sent to the House Committee on Elections
and Privileges for examination. After Shafroth had ex
amined a portion of them he assured the House that if
he were sitting as a judge on the evidence of the ballots
he would be compelled to decide against himself, there
fore without waiting for action or report by the com
mittee he gave up his seat.
Mr. Shafroth has been in Congress four terms. Though
in the minority he has commanded the respect of all/ He
was one of the working members and rendered valuable
public service. The committee and the House exoner
ated him of any privity to the frauds which were com
mitted by his party. Indeed it was satisfactorily shown
that he had done everything , he could to have a fair
election. He leaves his seat with the profound respect
of the House and of the country.
This very dramatic episode raises a collateral question
of more than passing interest. It was charged in Colo
rado-that the same ballot frauds extended to the election
of members of the Legislature, but investigation in that
respect was prevented, and hence it was believed that
the re-election of United States Senator Teller was
tainted by fraud and illegality. But he was elected and
holds his seat. It remains , to be seen whether hewill
follow the highly honorable course of Mr. Shafroth, and
demand an investigation of the ballots cast for the mem
bers of the Legislature who elected him.
While Senator Teller's political course has been sinu
ous, hfe has always ranked both in the Republican and
Democratic parties as an honest man. His. public ser
vice has been long and yaried. , He was one of the first
Senators from Colorado, and was still a Senator in 1882
when he resigned to succeed Governor Kirkwood as Sec
retary of the Interior under President Arthur. Upon the
termination of that service he was returned to the Sen
ate as a Republican in 1885, and was still a Senator when
he walked out of the Republican National Convention in
1896, and has held his seat as a Populist, Silver Republi
can and Democrat.
Such a man cannot afford to be the beneficiary of. the
frauds of his party, and it is clearly his duty to purge
himself of all suspicion of benefiting by corruption of
the ballot-box. Like him, Mr. Shafroth entered public
life and Congress as a- Republican. They were both
well brought tip, and it will be good for public morality
if each "show his_raising" by refusing to hold a seat that
is smirched by illegality.
The authorities at # Washington have taken late steps
but wise ones to place American Consuls upon a proper
plane of dignity in the many foreign cities where they
serve Americans and should reflect the prominence and
power of the United States. "Our Consuls should be well
housed and well paid.
RAILWAYS AND WORLD POLITICS.
RUSSIA'S menacing advance upon China, precipita
ting war with Japan, is generally spoken of as
another march of imperial ambition not essen
tially dissimilar to the conquests of former ages. So,
too, the annexation of the Dutch republics in South
Africa to the British empire has been lookeH upon as im
perial aggression ; a like view will be taken of the expan
sion of the German colonial system in Africa as soon as
it becomes sufficiently aggressive to attract public atten
tion and occasion comment.
Such views of the progress of the white man's con
quest in our time, however, are not wholly correct. It
was' not imperialism, but railway construction, that has
set the nations marching so aggressively in all parts of
the world in these later years. Britain would never have
coveted the Transvaal, nor even Orange Free State,
had not Cecil Rhodes pushed his railway enterprises to
the north and projected the famous line from the Cape
to Cairo. Russia would not now be tightening_her grip
upon .Manchuria, in defiance of the powers and in viola
tion of solemn treaties, had she not first constructed a
railway across Siberia. What she is now seeking is not
so much a military conquest as a commercial port neces
sary to the best use of her great transcontinental line.
The important part that railways are now playing in
the world should not be overlooked, for a clear under
standing of it is essential to a right view of the menaces
of war to-day and the possibilities of future war. It is
to be borne in mind that the Siberian road and the
Cape to Cairo road are not the only great enterprises of
the kind under way. There are several other roads
hardly noted now, whose construction may force an issue
of battle in future just as the Siberian road is, forcing
battle now.
Of the new lines that are almost certain to have a po
tent influence on world politics in the immediate future
perhaps the most notable is the line that is to be con
structed under German control from the Bosphbrus
to the Gulf of Persia down the valley of the Euphrates
or of the Tigris. A considerable part of the line is al
ready constructed and concessions for the whole route,
so far as it lies through the Turkish empire, have been
obtained. The road of course will need an outlet to the
sea, and the only outlet possible must be found some
where on the Persian Gulf. It happens that both Russia
and Great Britain are keenly interested in the gulf ports.
Russia has railway lines tending to the sea in that quar
ter, while Great Britain will watch with no little jealousy
the establishment in those waters of any power able to
maintain there a naval force strong enough to threaten
the route between India and the Suez Canal.
Another line that carries with it a menace of war h
the projected extension of the British Indo : Burmah
Railway to the head of navigation on the Yangtse-Kiang.
The road if completed would open up middle China to
British trade through India. Its construction, however,
would compel the establishment of some form of British
control over the terminal in China, and as a consequence
Great Britain would probably find herself compelled to
play a role similar to that now being enacted by the Rus
sians in Manchuria. .
Finally it is to be borne in mind that there are lines
which sooner or later must be constructed in our own
hemisphere that will be very apt to involve war issues.
The much discussed line connecting the railway systems
of South America with our own may some day be under
taken, and then will arise the question of maintaining
peace along the route. Another element of danger lies
in the fact that German interests in Brazil are already
large and in the end will^demand railways across the con
tinent. Such lines will be likely to disturb the existing
order of things and lead to" international disputes; so
that in the new as well as in the old world there axe pos
sibilities of railway wars looming up over the future as
far as human foresight can reach.,
In short the twentieth centuryjs likely to be a century
of wars caused mainly by the extension of industrial and
commercial enterprises. Railway influences will be felt
in international as well a* in domestic politics, and the
railway projector will be as potent in conquest as any of
the military adventurers of the past.

TALK OF THE TOWN
AND TOPICS OF THE
TIMES
The Unknozvn God.
Down In one of the old rookeries on
Montgomery street, the office rooms of
which are now given over to penniless
artists and slaves of the pen. there
live~s a newspaper man whose sense of
humor is larger than his purse. After
a little incident that occurred several
nights ago he feels that, humble as his
station may be, he is yet an unknown
god in the eyes of at least ene of the
nameless wretches whose haunts are
the alleys and wine shops of the old
quarter down back of the hall.
After the *paper had gone to press
and the newspaper scribe had tramped
his weary way down the deserted street
to his room he was endeavoring to fight
away insomnia by leaning out of his
window and sucking on his old briar
while he idly watched the scampering
rats in the dimly lit alley below. His
attention was attracted by the zigzag
tacking down the alley of the huddled
figure of a drunk. Hardly had the be
sotted toper come directly below him
when a black figure darted out from
the shadow of the fish market, dealt
the shambling drunkard a blow on the
jaw which felled him and then began
to disrobe him.
Overcoat, hat. jacket and vest came
off in a twinkling and then with a final
tug the shres were gone, too, and the
sudden apparition was off down the
alley with his bundle tucked under his
arm. Those clothes safely represented
50 cents and that would buy "the dope"
for several days.
From the despoiled one lying below
in the dark street there came a jum
bled roar of oaths and protest which
trailed off into a whimper as the cold
mc-rning air began to nip. Four stories
above in his window the reporter was
enjoying it hugely. Then a merry
thought came to him.
He ducked into his room for a min
ute and then returned to the window,
arms full of old clothes. First he pep
pered the thing below with a choice
assortment of c-ld socks, tightly knotted
in pairs. Then a pair of veteran trous#
ers went gyrating down through the*
gloom; a jacket fell like a lump of lead,
and finally an old mackintosh swooped
and sailed like a vampire down to the
bewildered creature.
He looked up; there was no light â
nothing but the walls rising cheerless
in the dim morning half light. Then
he laughed like a loon and, gathering
up the clothes, cavorted down the alley
singing lustily.
Her Anszi.'cr.
She sat modestly and quietly in a
corner on the upper deck of an Oak
land ferry-boat, one of the first of the
afternoon throng of homeward-bound
commuters. A book engrossed her at
tention and she was not aware that a
bold pair of eyes were staring at her,
the owner a dapper . and bit over
dressed man with a pair of grips, for
the world like a drummer's outfit.
Some of the passengers noticed the
ogling and pretty soon she raised her
glance from the pages and caught the
stare. She blushed and fidgeted in her
seat. The eyes continued their insult
ing stare.
As if he thought there was response
in her sudden, shifting glance, he
moved closer to the woman, then still
closer. She nervously felt the ad
vance. There had been no intentional
move of encouragement on her part.
The situation became very embarrass
ing, for he turned to her with a
"Good evening; you seem to be en
joying that book, miss."
The demure little creature flashed
anger and was all excitement in an
instant. She had avoided the scene,
but with one rousing swing she struck
that impertinent fellow full in the
face- with open palm, the slapping
blow being heard by many passengers.
Then the girl, her face red with sup
pressed emotion, settled back in her
seat. The man, all in a heap from
surprise, gathered himself together
and escaped to the lower deck, with
the jeers of a bunch of women echo
ing behind him.

confess the quotations you gave on.
Friday from a South African corre
sponded strike me as quite a novel de
parture in the way of unctuous recti
tude. After a series of violent asser
tions, none of which he attempts to
prove, the writer appeals to "the blood,
the misery, the tears' that will follow
the arrival of the Chinese In my ex
perience the blood, the misery and the
tears have been entirely on the side of
the unhappy Chinamen whom the
hooligans and their backers have felt
at liberty to assault, to rob and to
murder at their sweet will. The China
man, to whom the early prosperity of
California was so largely owing, is a
singularly laborious and law-abiding
citizen, and for that reason he was
hated, ill-treated and ultimately pro
hibited in the Qolden Stateâ whose
prosperity, by the way, 'hereby suf
fered a lasting check."
Now, Just wherein has California
suffered a 'lasting check" from the ex
clusion act?
Word Blindness.
Some curious instances of the physi
cal defect of "word blindness" are
given in the Lancet. The disease is.
fortunately, uncommon. In one case
the sufferer, an Englishman, 34 years
of age, who knew Greek, Latin *\nd
French well, suddenly lost all knowl
edge of English, though he could read
and understand Greek perfectly, and
Latin and French in a rather smaller
degree. Another and almost more cu
rious case was that of a man who lost
the power of reading at sight. Thi3
patient was able to write accurately
from dictation, but was completely un
able to read what he had written.
World blindness is apparen !y akin to
color blindness, but i3 certainly attend
ed by much more inconvenient conse
quences.

REPUBLICANS
TO THE FRONT
Chairman Cutter Ready to
Send Out Notice for Meet
ing of the State Committee
William M. Cutter of Tuba, chair
man of the Republican State Commit
tee, is in the city conferring with
Charles E. Snook, secretary, and Jacob
Steppacher, assistant secretary of the
committee. To-day notices will be sent
out advising members that a general
meeting of the committee will take
place at Golden Gate Hall, San Fran
cisco, on Saturday, March 12, at 2 p. m.
The executive committee will meet
at the Union League Club at 8 p. m.,
March 11. In line with the preliminary
precedents, the call for the State con
vention will be discussed by the execu
tive committee. Decisions of the ex
ecutive body respecting the time and
place of meeting and the appointment
of delegates to the several counties of
the State are usually confirmed by the
general committee.
It is already indicated that the State
convention will consist of 738 delegates.
The basis of representation is one dele
gate for every 200 votes cast for Gov
ernor Pardee In 1902, and one delegate
for each majority fraction of 200 votes.
INTEIUOlt WILL DOMINATE.
ft Is clearly foreshadowed that the
cÂ»untry delegates will dominate the
convention, and party leaders maintain
that this domination Is just, as the
country supplied the voting strength
for the achievement of Republican suc
cess in the gubernatorial campaign in
1902. San Francisco will enter the Re
publican State convention with dimin
ished prestige. The number of dele
gates accredited to the metropolis is
121. or less than one-sixth of the whole
body.
Los Angeles will come to the conven
tion withf increased power. The dele
gation from that ccilnty will be ninety
strong. In the last gubernatorial cam
paign Los Angeles cast an exception
ally large and San Francisco an un
usually small vote for the leading nomi
nee on the Republican ticket. The dis
tricts south of Market street in this
city, which gave Lane such an over
whelming vote, will have but a slight
representation In the Republican con
ventions of this year.
Sacramento- County will not cut
much of a figure in the convention,
as the Republicans of that county in
the last State election failed to sus
tain the head of the ticket. San Joa
quin and Solano will have to be satis
fied with small delegations.
The national convention of the Re
publican party will meet in Chicago
June 21. and delegates thereto must
be chefn thirty days prior to that
date. The primary election for choos
ing delegates to the State convention
must be held, according to law, on the
first Tuesday of May. Therefore the
State convention cannot be held much
later or earlier than May 18.
XEW RKGISTRATIOW
It is the general impression that the
first Republican State convention of
the campaign will meet in Sacramento.
The chief business of this convention
will be the election of four delegates
at large to the national convention,
the confirmation of Congressional dis
trict delegates and the selection of a
new State Central Committee. A State
convention late in August or early in
September will nominate Presidential
Electors. At -the same time Congres
sional nominations will be made by the
respective district conventions.
George P. Adams, Registrar of Vot
ers, San Francisco, is sending out a
general notice advising all citizens
that, pursuant to law, a new and com
plete registration of all voters is now
in progress at the City Hall and that
such registration is good for two years
and will cover al! elections held in the
years 1904 and 1905. All previous reg
istrations have been canceled.
The Registrar Is anxious to impress
upon the minds of the voting public
that all registrations prior to January
1, 1904, have been canceled. The first
primary election of the year will take
place Tuesday, May 3, and If an early
awakening to the importance of this
event does not occur the vote will be

PROMINENT SWEDISH
AMERICAN PASSES AWAY
Prof. Carl A. Svvensson, Head of Bethany College in Kan
sas and a Well-Known Divine, Is Stricken Suddenly
With Pneumonia and Dies at Hospital in Los Angeles
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 16.â Professor
Carl A. Swensson, D. D. and Ph. D.,
president of Bethany College, Linds
borg, Kans., one of the foremost
Swedish Americans In this country,
died of pneumonia at the California
Hospital this morning after only two
days' illness. He was caught in a rain
In San Francisco a few days ago, and
when he arrived here Saturday night
he was suffering from a severe cold.
Sunday the cold developed into pneu
monia and he was taken to the hos
pital, where he was given the best pos
sible medical attention. Despite all that
the phj'siclans could do the solidifica
tion of his lungs continued, until death
occurred before daylight this morning.
The remains were shipped East to
night to the home of the deceased in
Kansas, and were accompanied by
those who had come to California with
Dr. Swensson. They areiliev. Dr. Abra
hamson of Chicago; Abel Anderson,
president of the Northwestern National
Bank of Sioux City. Iowa: Albert J.
Coleson of Kansas City and N. J.
Thorstenberg. Mayor Lindsborg.
Information of the death of the found
er and president of Bethany College,
Kansas, will occasion profound regret
among the Swedish Lutherans on this
coast. He came to California a few
days ago Jn response to an invitation
from Manager Briggs of the California
State Board of Trade to inspect lands
in the San Joaquln Valley., The clergy
man had been for some time in corre
spondence with the California^tate
Board of Trade in reference to Cfte lo
cating of Swedish colonies in this State.
Finally he came to the State, in com
pany with the Rev. Dr. L. G. Abraham
son of the Princeton-avenue Lutheran
Church of Chicago, who has the reputa
tion of being the leading Swedish Luth
eran clergyman in the United States.
Last week these clergymen, in company
with Manager Briggs of the California
State Board of Trade, toured the San
Joaquin Valley and inspected various
localities.
Mr. Briggs says that the Rev. Carl
Swensson was In perfect health seem
ingly last Friday when he started on
his homeward journey by way of Los
Angeles. He was 48 years old. weighed
240 pounds, was over six feet tall and
looked to be in the very flower of health
and strength.
Bethany College, of which the Rev.
Dr. Swenpson was the head, is located
at Lindsborg, Kans. It is one of the
largest and best established institu
tions of learning in Kansas. It was
founded in 1881 by the Rev. Dr. Swens
son. The following year the Smoky
Valley district of the Kansas confer
ence of the Augustana Synod took
charge of the institution and appointed
POSTUM CEBEAL.
THE OLD PLEA,
lie "Didn't Know It Was Loaded."
The cDffee drinker seldom realizes
that coffee contains the drug caffeine,
a serious poison to the heart and
nerves, thereby causing many other
forms cf disease, noticeably dyspepsia.
"I was a lover of coffee and used it
for many years, and did not realize the
bad effects I was suffering from its use.
"At first I was troubled with indiges-
tion, but did not attribute the trouble
to the use of coffee, but thought it arose
from other causes. With these attacks
I had sick headache, nausea and vomit-
ing. Finally my stomach was in such
a condition I could scarcely retain any
food.
"I consulted a physician; was told all
my troubles came from indigestion, but
was not Informed what caused the in-
digestion, so I kept on with the coffee
and kept on with the troubles, toa,
and my case continued to grow worse
from year to year, until it developed
into chronic diarrhea, nausea and se-
vere attacks of vomiting, bo I could
keep nothing on my stomach and be-
came a mere shadow, reduced from 159
to 128 pounds.
"A specialist informed me I had a
very severe case of catarrh of the stom-
ach, which had got so bad he could do
nothing for me, and I. became convinced
my days were numbered.
"Then I chanced to sep an article set-
ting forth the good qualities of Pos-
tum, and explaining how coffee injures
people, bo I concluded to give Postum
a trial. I soon saw the good effects;
my headaches were less frequent, nau-
sea and vomiting only came on at long
intervals and I was soon a changed
man, feeling much better.
"Then I thought I could stand coffee
again, but as soon as I tried it my old
troubles returned and I again returned
to Postum. Would you believe it, I
did this three times before I had sense
enough to quit coffee for good and keep
on with the- Postum. The result is I
am now a well man, with no more
headaches, sick stomach or vomiting
and have already gained back to 147
pounds." Name given by Postum Co.,

the post yesterday. It gives a careful
and serious review of the gallant of

While in a measure , complimentary,
still, in the words of Othello, it is a
"round, unvarnished tale" of his expe
riences since he entered the army in
18G1. It was read with much inter
est by his brother officers at the Pre
sidio.
General MacArthur, accompanied
by his aid, Major Parker W. West,

When Silver Dick, Becky and

Struggle Is Sure to Ensue
The cScials of the California, Polo
and Pony Racing Association were
overwhelmed yesterday with entries
for their initial meeting, which opens
to-morrow at Del Monte. More^ than
100 ponies will be on the ground and
the question of transportation, became
a eerious one during the day. It was
finally decided to charter a epecJal en
gine, which will take down the cars
containing the remaining ponies this
morning.
There are an average of twelve en
tries for each of the races on Thursday
and Saturday. Some of these minia
ture race horses have been in training
on the <juset and a number of sur
prises will be sprung when the saddling
bell sounds. The colors of several new
espirants for racing honors will be seen
for the first time.
Paul Clagstone has brought the pony
MJss Miller down from the north and
much Is expected of her, as she has a
big reputation as a sprinter. When
the hooks up with Silver Dick and
Becky the spectators will see a con
test eeldom presented by ponies.
T. A. Driscoll, secretary of the asso
ciation, sent word from Del Monte yes
terday that Monday's rain had not
reached there and that both the track
end the polo field would be in excellent
condition for the meetings J. A. Cody,
an experienced track man from the
touth, is assisting in placing it In good
order.
The majority of the poloists leave
tor Del Monte to-day in order to get
us much practice as possible on the
field and to work out their ponies.
There is a scarcity of good gentlemen
Jockeys and the services of the best
riders will bo in strong demand.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY IT, 1904.
PRINCESS TITANIA IS FIRST,
A NOSE AHEAD OF FUTURITA
Favorites Capture Two
Purses at Ingle
side.
In a finish that was so close and so
exciting: that not until the numbers had
been flashed on the indicator from the
judges' stand were any tickets torn up.
Princess Titanla waB awarded a nose
verdict over Futurita In the Bix and a
half furlong handicap yesterday at In
gleside.
There were only four starters, and
the Princess, with Johnny Daly up.
was a pronounced favorite in the bet
tingr. "Big Bill" Knapp, on Futurita,
succeeded in parting: company with the
others on the far turn, reaching the
etretch with a commanding lead. Had
Knapp not lost a world of ground on
the bend the finish would not have
been close. But he did, and when nabbed
by Daly after passing the paddock
gate his mount lost the decision by a
short nose. Arabo finished an ordinary
third. -v
TIIE TRACK IMPROVES.
The track had dried out remarkably
fast over night. It was, of course,
heavy, but little or no mud was flying,
and the weather turned off clear and
cool. El Piloto and Princess Titania
were the only winning favorites.
Harbor was there in the opening
six-furlong run with a varied assort
ment of speed, and, well played at
7 and 8 to 1, won rather handily from
Rlesca. The latter mare, backed from
15 down to 6, might have won had
Cross made a closer turn into the
stretch, when leading the bunch.
Travers finished on the inside with
Harbor, saving considerable ground.
Serenity, the favorite, received a de
lightful going over at the hands of
Foley, finishing third. Red Bird led
for three furlongs and then died away.
Pruewood. piloted by Hildebrand
and at one stage of the betting 25 to 1,
captured the next, a six and a half
furlong spin, decided under selling
conditions. Suburban Queen, the fa
vorite, led almost to the stretch, where
Pruewood took the lead. In a hard
drive Hildebrand landed the outsider
first, less than a length before Adiron
dack. Willie See, on Possart, a 12 to 1
shot, was a close third. The first
choice died away to nothing.
FAVORITE RUNS FOURTH.
Although Velma Clark never showed
to much advantage over a heavy
track, Hildebrand had the leg up.
which served as sufficient excuse for
the books to chalk her up an 8 to 5
choice. Her price later on in the bet
ting touched threes and she ran fourth
in a five-horse race. El Piloto, with
Foley in the saddle, finally closed fa
vorite and downed Flaneur without
much difficulty. Pierce J was third.
Trainer Tobe Ramsey did not think
Bombardier good enough to win the
mile and fifty-yard selling purse. . It
so happened that on this special occa
sion G. W. Trahern was the only one
of the other four starters possessing
any speed. The latter horse made all
the running and in a long driving fin
ish enly lost the decision by half a
length. Foley rode the , favorite, Ax
minster,* which ran third. His effort
in the saddle was assuredly a brilliant
one. "Big Bill" Knapp piloted Dun
gannon, which opened favorite, and he
lost ground enough to win a dozen
races. Caronal, another heavily backed
one, finished strong on the outside, but
got nothing.
It looked like forcing matters a bit
in starting Mr. Dingle again, notwith
standing which he was Installed favor
ite for the concluding mile and a six
teenth recital. He made a game bid for
the money, but after leading through
out Expedient beat him half a length
at the finish. The winner was well
ridden by Jack Martin. Chickadee ran
third.
NOTES OF TIIE TRACK.
Hildebrand landed Bombardier
first and then left the track in order
to catch the Owl train for Los An
geles. He departs with^the satisfac
tion of knowing that he leads all of
the riders in the number of winning
mounts.
Saturday will be the closing day of
the season at Ingleside. Many of the
horses are coughing and as Oakland
appears to be more popular with the
horsemen the California Jockey Club
has decided to transfer the scene of
racing operations to the track across
the bay. The California Derby will
be decided o"h Monday next.
President Thomas H. .Williams and
wife returned yesterday from a visit
to our sister republic. While in the
City of Mexico Mr. and Mrs. Wil
liams were most hospitably enter
tained by Fred Finchler of El Paso,
Ignacio de la Torre, son-in-law of
President Diaz of Mexico, and by Al
berto Tarrazas, son of the Governor of
Chihuahua.
Foley left for Hot Springs last
night, where he Joins the stable of his
employer, Paul Miles.
Johnny Schorr started Olympian for
the first time at the meeting in the
handicap. He bled and was pulled up
by Reed.

BURTON MUST
GO TO TRIAL
United States District Court
Overrules Demurrer of Kansas
Senator in the Fraud Case
ST. LOUIS, Feb. 16.â Judge Adams,
in the United States District Court,-to
day overruled the demurrer of United
States Senatdr Joseph R. Burton of
Kansas to the indictment charging him
with accepting money for using his in
fiuence in preventing the issuance of
a fraud order, against the Rialto Grain
a.id Securities Company.
The trial of the Senator was set for
March 22. A panel of sixty jurors has
been ordered for that date.
In reading his decision Judge Adams
consumed twenty-five minutes, giving
each point raised by the defendant
careful analysis. Both Senator Burton
and Major Hugh C. Dennis of the
Rialto Grain and Securities Company
were in court. The indictment grew
out of the troubles of the Rialto Grain
and Securities Company, when that
concern ran afoul of the United States
Postoffice Department and further use
of the mails was denied it. It is
charged that for $500 per month Sen
ator Burton was to use his Influence
to have the embargo removed.
In filing the demurrer to the indict
ment the defendant contended that the
postmaster did not have the authority
to forbid the Rialto Grain and Securi
ties "Company the use of the mails or
to issue a fraud order. Also that there
was no substantial charge of fraud
at the time. Both of these questions
were dismissed by Judge Adams with
the remark that he was not Impressed
with them. The question as to whether
the United States was interested in
the case called for a more extended
opinion, but Judge Adams held that It
was interested. He then ordered the
case to be tried March 22.

FLOATS DOWN
RIVER ON LOG
Unknown Man Observed in a
Perilous Position in a Storm-
Swollen Stream of the North
REDDING, Feb. 16.â According to re
ports from points north, a man shout
ing for help is riding down the storm
swollen Sacramento River on a- log.
He is said to have passed Kennet at
dusk, and "was seen at Central Spur,
farther south a short while later. The
stranded individual must have passed
Redding during the night. This morn
ing, unless dead, he must be far down
the valley.
The sun was shining this morning
after the fiercest rainstorm experienced
in the northern counties in a long while.
The Sacramento River was twenty-one
feet above normal last night, the high
est point attained In many years. All
creeks are running bank full. Mail
stages due here last night from Bieber,
Lassen County; Weaverville, Trinity
County; Delmar, Shasta County, and
Harrison Gulch, Shasta County, have
not yet arrived. Nothing can . be
learned about any of them this morn
ing. Railroad traffic is also seriously
crippled by the storm. A landslide six
miles north of Dunsmuir held trains
all day yesterday. It was just cleared
last night and trains passed through,
when the mountain side again slid
down, covering the track twenty feet
deep for a hundred yards. So the trains
are again tied up to-day.
Richie Knocks Out De Coursey.
SAN DIEGO, Feb. 16. â Johnnie
Richie of Brooklyn and Billy de
Coursey of Los Angeles fought twelve
rounds of a scheduled twenty-round
contest to-night before the San Diego
Athletic Club. Richie won and proved
himself a clever ring general. He
went after De Coursey from the start
and kept him on the run continually.
He landed many heavy blows, but was
not able to knock his man out until
the beginning 6t the thirteenth round.
De Coursey showed himself a glutton
for- punishment and put up a game
fight. -.He was outclassed by a better
man and a veteran fighter.
Kelly Makes Peculiar Charge.
In a suit for 1 $50,000 damages for
breach of contract filed yesterday by
John Kelly, a milkman, against the
Bay Counties Commercial Company
he makes a Deculiar charge in support
of his allegation that he has been
hurt by the actions of the defendant.
He says the defendant agreed to fur
nish him first-class milk and then
gave him such a poor quality that one
of, his customers, whose little child
died, told his other customers that the
milk had caused the death of the lit
tle one. .Kelly says the rumor ef
fectually ruined his business and
caused him great pecuniary loss.

ADAMS TO CAPTAIN TEAM
The Man Who Succeeds 0v
1 erall as Leader Will Fill
the Position of Shortstop
BERKELEY, Feb. 16.â Now that the
captaincy has been fixed by the elec
tion of "William W. Adams to command
the baseball men of the University of
California, the players . have settled
down to hard, consistent work. Nothing
bothers them now except the rain, and
all they have to attend to is the educa
tion of their catching fingers and bat
ting eyes.
Despite the fact that there are only
four of last year's varsity men left on,
the team and that the loss of Overall
has pierced a big hole in the pitching
department, there still seems a good
chance to win the intercollegiate series.
In the two games the team has played
It has won with consummate ease. Un
practlced as it Is, it has gone out and
beaten the alumni team with its com
bination of former stars and captains,
among whom were Overall, with his
swift, unerring twisters. In the first of
these the -score was 11 to 5, in the sec
ond 6 to 2.
These games demonstrated that the
pitching material is not going to be so
inadequate as was first thought.
Hughes, a youth from the Oakland
High School and a freshman, pitched
against the redoubtable Overall in the
first game and acquitted himself well.
The only trouble about Hughes is that
he may not be eligible to go into the
game, as he has something to make up
in. his studies before he will be a full
fledged member of the university.
Hughes promises to correct this trou
ble, but his colleagues say he will have
to hurry up if he wants to get in.
"Heine" Heitmuller of last year's
varsity, and Hadley^a recruit from the
Los Angeles High School, pitched in the
second game. Hadley officiated the first
three innings and Heitmuller the last
six. The alumni batters found Hadley
pretty often with their bats and rather
discouraged him. Heitmuller held them
down to a few scattering hits. He has
a ball that he shoots across the plate
like a cannon ball and confuses the
batters.
There is an interesting contest on be
tween Hatch and Bliss, both last year's
varsity men, for catcher. Hatch played
in the place last year and acquitted
himself well. Bliss is tired of second
base and wants to catch, and as he is
bigger and stronger and more ag
gressive than Hatch he may win out.
In that case Hatch will go either to
first or second base.
Graham, a sophomore, is playing first
base in good style. He is well ac
quainted with the game and knows
how to field as well as bat.
Second cushion is being played by
Gillis, formerly of Belmont. and Rob
inson, a Berkeley High School boy.
Gillis seems to have the best of ittand
fields the position like a man used to
it all his life. Robinson will be good
for the field in case he does not make
second base.
â At shortstop Captain Adams is all
alone in his glory. Nobody is likely to
disturb hiat there, because he knows
the position and fields well. His bat
ting is his most telling weakness, and
if he fails to make the team it will be
on that account.
For third cushion there are Strub
and Gunn, b/5th freshmen, who have
been bearing" up nobly under the re
sponsibilities and disappointments of
that hardest of jobs. This duo plays an
even game.
The fielding positions are all more or
less uncertain. It depends much upon
who'makes good on infield places. Ken
neth Hamilton. Spencer, Graham.
Hatch and Robinson are all eligible for
the left, center and right gardens.
"It's a little bit early to size up the
men." said Jack" McCarthy, the Cali
fornia coach, to-day. "We've only been
practicing a week or so. Judging from
the material and the way the men have
gone at their practice I don't see why
we can't ge.t up a winning team. There
are five new men to develop and fit in,
and that is no easy job. I must say I
am surprised at the work of some of
the freshmen who have just entered
college. They play the game very well
Indeed.
"I am inclined to think the team will
be weakest in batting. That is a usual
fault with college teams, and it will be
my work to overcome this defect as
much as possible. Heitmuller, Bliss,

In nc-tifyinp the Board of Works that
the charges aprainst Murphy had been

too severe a penalty and recommended
that he be simply reprimanded. The

prr.Tr.ptly dismissed Murphy because he
had been found guilty of the charges.

LABROUSSE'S ATTORNEYS
SHOW PLAN OF DEFENSE
Introduce a Witness to Prove That the Defendant Had Been of
Unsound Mind Several Months When He Shot and Killed Marie
Jordan â Mother and Sister of Slain Girl Tell Their Stories
MRS. CAROLINE JORDAN. MOTHER OF MARIE JORDAN. WHO WAS KILLED BY EDMOND DE L.A
BROUSSE, AND LITTLE GENEVA PORTIER, BOTH OF WHOM TESTIFIED AT THE TRIAL OF THE
ACCUSED MURDERER IN JUDGE DUNNE'S COURT YESTERDAY.
To convince the Jury that Edmond do
Labrousse was mentally deranged when
he killed Marie Jordan is the purpose
of Attorneys W. H. Alford and T. J.
Roche, who represent him. Their plan
of defense was prematurely exposed
yesterday when they put Attorney J.
H. Creely, a life-long friend of the de
fendant, upon the witness stand and
obtained from him a positive opinion
that for several months prior to the
tragedy Labrousse was insane.
Another interesting feature of the
murder trial, which is being conducted
in Superior Judge Dunne's court, was
the appearance as a witness of the vic
tim's aged mother. When her name
was called the defendant was staring
Into vacancy, his chin resting upon his
hand, and as she advanced to the stand
he covered his face with his fingers,
bowed his head and remained in that
attitude until she was dismissed. Mrs.
Jordan never looked at him, however,
even when asked. "Do you know the
defendant at the bar?" Labrousse sat
between his two sisters, who lookM
steadily at, every witness as the evi
dence for the prosecution was adduced.
Miss Lillian Jordan, whom Labrousse
had accused of responsibility for the
estrangement between himself and her
sister, also testified, and nine-year-old
Geneva Portier told her story of the
killing with much more directness than
was shown by most of the adult wit
nesses.
LiABROUSSETS SANITY*.
After Autppsy Surgeon Bacigalupi
and Gripman Jackson had repeated the
testimony they had given at the in
quest and the preliminary hearing and
held it unshaken through rigid cross
examination. Attorney Roche asked the
prosecution's permission to introduce a
witness for the defense who could not
conveniently be In the city again until
after this week expires. The requested
leave was readily given and Attorney
James H. Creely took the stand. He
stated he had known Labrousse for
twenty-six years, since they were boys
together, and had always found him
of a dutiful and lovable disposition,
though of nervous temperament, until
October, 1898. when he had some dif
ference with his family and left home.
Then his manner began to undergo a
change, which, the witness believed,
developed lunacy. Shortly before the
homicide the witness and the. defendant
met on Sansome street and the latter
talked Incoherently, had a wild glare
In his eyes and started away suddenly,
swinging his arms In an imbecillc way.
. "I was then satisfied that the man
was of unsound mind," said the wit
ness, "and many times afterward he
gave additional reason for that belief.
He could not tell me where he worked.
When I heard of the shooting I won
dered why he had not been placed un
der restraint some time before It hap
pened. I believe the young woman's
life was lost through the man being
allowed his liberty."
"Didn't you try to have him' placed
under restraint when you became satis
fied he was Insane?" asked District At
torney Byington, in cross-examination.
"No," wau the answer; "I did not tell
any one of his condition."
"Didn't you discuss his condition with
his attorneys after the shooting?'.'
"Yes, I mentioned It casually to At
torney Roche one day in Judge Sloss'
court"
A POSITIVE .AVITXESS.
Very positive in his testimony was
Arthur Long, the carpenter who was at
work across the street from the Jordan
home and saw the.entlre tragedy. So
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 17/1904.
severely did Attorney Roche try to
shake his testimony, however, that Mr.
Long more than once plainly showed
irritability. As he told of how La
brousse had fired two bullets into his
victim's breast, the defendant's heav
ing shoulders expressed the emotion
that was convulsing him, but he did
not raise his head.
The line of questioning suggested by
Alford and voiced by Roche was appar
ently to disprove Long's assertion that
Labrousse's right hand was in his* coat
pocket from the time he came within
Long's range of vision until the shoot
ing began, and so hard was the ques
tioning adhered to that the witness at
last blurted out: "When a man don't
know a thing,- he don't know it, does
he?"
At the afternoon session John Sulli
van, who was a witness of Labrousse's
attempt to kill himself after he had
killed Miss Jordan, told his story, and
Fred Martin's narrative was some
what similar. All the witnesses of the
shooting , testified that Labrousse's
hand trembled as he held the pistol
against his own head.

. Mrs. Caroline Jordan told of her

and of the family conference, at which
the girl said she would not promise to

told he owed his sister $400 or $500,
and she felt offended because it had
been insinuated that he was spending
money on her and her family. . Mrs.
Jordan was very considerately treated
by the attorneys and the court and it
was apparent that the tragedy had se
verely shaken her nervous system.
Dr. George Herzall, .who was the

DEFINES STATUS
OF A TEACHER
City Attorney, Long Renders
Opinion Affecting Tenure of
Probationary Pedagogues
FORMAL ACTION REQUIRED
Board of Education Must Adopt
Resolution Electing Them
Regular Tutors in Department
City Attorney Long advised Superin
tendent of Schools Langdon yesterday
that the election of a teacher in the
public school deDartment for a. proba
tionary term of -three years does not
make her a regular teacher unless a
formal resolution to that effect is
adopted by the Board of Education.
The opinion affects the tenure of a
large number of teachers, who having
served their probationary period of
three years in a satisfactory manner
were continued in their positions as
regular teachers without any further
formal action of the Board of Educa
tion. In his opinion Long says:
You are advised that a resolution of the
Board of Education is necessary at the expira
tion of the probationary term to constitute tne
teacher a "regular" teacher In the department.
Upon such election the teacher can only bo re
moved In accordance with the provisions of
section 1793 of the Political Code after con
viction upon charges properly preferred.
The Supreme Court of the State has con
cluded In ' two leading cases that the power
conferred by the statute upon boards of educa
tion in cities is without restriction as to the
term of employment and that under It a
teacher may be employed for a definite term
to be fixed by the board. When the board has
employed a teacher for .a year the court says
"It would 1 b absurd to say that It could not dis
pense with the services of such teacher at the
end of the year."
In the light of the statue so construed the
conclusion is forced upon us that the employ
ment of teachers by the Hoard of Education
of San Francisco under the terms of its rule
on the subject must be held to "be a limited
employment to continue for three years, dur
ing which time the teacher is on probation. If
at the end of that time th? teacher shall have
satisfied the board of her ability to discharge
the duties of a teacher in the department she
may be elected a regular te.1cher therein, other
wise she is subject to discharge. Judge Sea
well haa held In the case of Ar&ueilo versus
the Board of Education that "nothing in sec
tion 179.1 of the Political Code shall be con
strued to prevent the Board of Education from
removing teachers holdtng only special cer
tificates or serving a probationary term."
"There are about 150 teachers," said
Superintendent Langdon, "who will
have to be elected by resolution of the
board. After the charter went into ef
fect a large number of probationary
appointments was made, but of these
only sixteen teachers were formally
elected at the expiration of their proba
tionary terms. The same action must
be taken with the others to make their
tenure secure."
"The effect of the opinion," said Pres
ident Roncovieri of the Board of Edu
cation, "will be that after a teacher has
served her probationary term she may
be dropped from the department if in
the opinion of the board she has been
found unsatisfactory in the perform
ance of her duties. In other words,
electing a teacher for a probationary
period is tantamount to making a con
tract with her for a stated period,
which contract ends unless the board
desires to renew it."

her what Labrousse had done with the
money he had borrowed from his sis

THE SAN FRANCISCO GALL, 'WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 17, 1901.
ALAMEDA MAKES ROUND TRIP
IN CONTINUOUS RAIN SHOWER
Oceanic Steamship Company's Liner Arrives From Honolulu With
160 Passengers â Encounters Very Wet Weather and Captain
Reports Precipitation at Honolulu 7 1-2 Inches in 12 Hours
The Oceanic Steamship Company's
liner Alameda, which arrived yester
day from Honolulu, brings a story of
rain which might well sound incredu
lous to Southern California ears. She
left here January 30. and ever since,
until yesterday morning, has been in
a constant downpour of rain. She ran
into the rain shortly after passing out
through the Golden Gate and in driving
squalls and torrential showers made
her way to Honolulu, where the down
pour changed to the solid, tropical kind.
During the Alameda's stay in Hono
lulu the rain poured down continuous
ly. In the space of twelve hours -800
tons of water fell cm the Waikiki estate
of W. R. Castle. The park was con
verted into a lake and eanoeins parties
explored the waters under which lay
the lawns and flower buds of sunnier
days. Near Kilihi during the same
twelve hours the registered rainfall
was 7 '.o inches.
It was raining when the Alameda left
Honolulu and on Monday night pas
sengers were lulled to sleep by the wa
ter patter on deck. The wind changed
to the northwest during the night, how
ever, and yesterday morning Captain
Dowdell discovered the sun^doing bril
liant work in its accustomed position.
Advantage was taken of the gener
ous supply of soft, fresh water to give
the decks a course of holystone mas
sage and in yesterday's sunshine the
planks looked white as bleached linen.
The Alameda brought 1G0 passengers.
In the steerage were 119 Japanese. Her
cargo of 17S0 tons included 16,285 sacks
of sugar, 5350 bunches of bananas and
11S2 sacks of coffee.
Among the passengers were the fol
lowing named: W. A. Bryan. S. M.
Lillie. B. T. MeCullough. Mrs. P. Owens
and child. H. S. Smith. J. "Wagner, Wil
liam Walsh, E. B. de Golia and wife.
Hiss Carey, Mrs. Herokda, E, Koons
and Mrs. Davey. '
Martaban is Uninsurablc
The British ship Martaban. on which 90 per
cert reinsuranco has been paid, was posted at
Lloyd's yesterday as uninsurable. She is out
15S days from Java for the BarbadoeB. The
Martaban is a new ship and this is her maiden
voyage. She is commanded by Captain Hcarn.
Little hope is experienced for her safety. The
other ovcniues are quoted as follows: Theodor.
.".0 per cent: Robert Rickmers. 15 per cent: w!
K. Babcork and Kangalore, 20 per cent; Gen
eral Mellinet, 10 per cent.
Much Susar Arrives.
Enough susar arrived yesterday from the
Hawaiian Islands to counteract the acid ln
the juice of all the lemons grown in California.
Of the K5.W1S sacks of sticky sweetness carried
through the Goldon Gate, the steamship Ala
meda brought from Honolulu 16,285 sacks: the
schooner Aloha, also from Honolulu, 2-'!,S25
sacks;_the bark Amy Turner, from'HIlo, 10,7t>8
sacks, 'and the bark Edward May, from Maka
wcli, 32,800 Backs.
Head Winds Delay 'Her.
The steam schooner Coquille River, which
arrived yesterday from Crescent City, encoun
tered southeast gales which considerably re
tarded her progress. Instead of making the
trip in 40 hours she was 74 hours from port to
port. She had a' heavy list to starboard, but
in fpito of this ard the high seas which con
tinually broke over the little vessel, ehe
brought hcrvicckload to port Intact.
French Bark looses Royal Yard.
Tlie steam schooner Rainier, which arrived

Three-Masted Schooner Emma
Utter Meets With Disaster
While in Barclay Sound
INDIANS SAVE A SAILOR
Lmnber-Ladeiu Craft on a
Voyage to San Francisco,
and Is a Total Wreck
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C, Feb. 16. â Two In
dians rescued Seaman Henry Byndall
this afternoon from the wreck of the
three-masted schooner Emma Utter
as she drove on the rocks at Leonard
Island, Barclay Sound, and began to
go to pieces under heavy seas.
The Utter left Grays Harbor Febru
ary 7 for San Francisco with 360,000
feet of lumber. The tug cast loose too
soon and the Utter struck the Aber
deen bar heavily, causing a serious
leafc. By the 10th instant she was
waterlogged and unmanageable. Cap
tain Hansen and five of the crew
abandoned the schooner on the 11th,
Byndall refusing to go with them.
Since then gales dismasted and dis
mantled her. ' She drifted helplessly
along the coast until a southwest gale
drove her among the reefs of .Barclay
entrance. Ocean tugs at Cape Flat
tery saw her and went to the rescue,
but the Indians grot there first in a
canoe. Byndall suffered severely from
exposure, hunger and thirst. He was
taken to Clayoquot and cared for by
the lighthouse-keeper. No word ha3
been received of the fate of Captain
Hansen and his men who left the
schooner * on the 11th inst. Heavy
weather has prevailed off the straits
for ten days past.

The Weather and Crops.
. ' The weekly report of A. G. McAflie, section
director of the climate and crop service of the
Weather Bureau, is as follows:
GENERAL SUMMARY.
Cool weather prevailed during the first of
the wwrk, with heavy from in many places.
. 'ibe latter j>Â«Â»rt of the wnk was warmer and
â¢ fc'tneraily cloudy, with heavy rain in the cen
tral ana northern fectlons and light rain in
the south. The precipitation In the coast and
Lay sections and i>ortlona of Northern Cali
lurnia was the heaviest of the Â»eaÂ»on, rangir.s
!ivm two to nine <.:.â  :..* for the storm of the
11th and :;.:;. Heavy snow :d in the
mountain districts. Rivrrs and creeks were
running bank tull. bridges and railroad track*
T*trÂ«Â» washtrd out and overland tratfic was
blockaded by the heavy enuw in the mountains.
There are no reports of damage to fanning
lands or .Tops by the heavy rain, but farming
ci^rations were suspended and in some places
cannot be resumed lor several days. Although
tfat precipitation in the southÂ«-rn districts was
comparatively light, its coming immediately
aftt-r ;ht rain ot the preceding week was very
bt-npficiai and farmers have become more
hopeful. Karly eown grain and grass have
made a good start end are growing rapidly,
tmncg and 5Â«-Â»*dlnB are in progress in ell the
couthern district*. In the ceatral aaii northtrn
ttctione grain continues In excellent condition
. an*i ,_.:.....,. i v making Â«rool xtvirtb; green
:e*d Is ,-h r.tiru: in most places end ca.ltle are
do.ng well. Tbe gruin acreage is reported
,
Orchards ar.d vineyards are In good condi
tion and pruning is nearly completed In pome
eectione. The cold weather has been beneScial
to de-.-iducus fruits in checking the too early
development of blocm, and prospects are good
*for large crops. Cltrcis fruits llave not Lt*n
fL-rioutiy daxaaged by frost.
COAST AND BAY SECTIONS.
Cool v.Â»*ith<-r continued during the firet of
thÂ«- wrrek. lollowed by cloudy, warmer weather
tn<J rain. The precipitation was the heaviest
> of the Beason in the central and northern sec
tions, amounting to 5.11 inches in Oakland
' "and vicinity, SÂ».l<> at Ean Harael. 3.00 at LÂ»an
\ ilk-. 4.10 at V*oavi:ie, U.<O. at Healdsburg and
2.7> in San Francisco. The rain extended to
the southern districts, and. though much
lighter than Â»bove noted, wu very beneficial
to irraSn and paeturaee. and ir followed by th
urual spring ruins there will probably be fair
crops or grain and hay. Karly sown grain and
i-- â â â â¢- *rc making rajild grewth and orchards
are in excellent tcndition. Tbe h^avy rainfall
in the northern districts flooded railroad tracks
tn.l cauwd a RUFjK-iifcion ot farm work. Rain
' commenced ecain on Sunday and is still
falling.
SACRAMENTO VALLET.
Cool, cloudy weather prevailed mott of the
%1-e^k. becoming somewhat warraÂ»-r at the close.
Heavy rain fell on the 11th and 12th, varying
:.'â .:. two to four inches, with heavy sr.ow in
the mountains. Rain ccmaieaced falling again
Sunday *nd continued until to-day. No dam
kge hiu* resulted Jrom the heavy rainfall except
in retarding farm work, but the heavy fall of
'<.:â ;â  enow in the mountains caused great
carnage to railroad property and blockaded
traffic for some time. Gram and pasturage
were benefited by the rain. The grain acreago
this *eaÂ«on will be large, and prospects are
pood for neavy crops. Orchards and vineyards
are in excellent condition and pruning is nearly
completed. The cool weather has prevented
the too early blocming of deciduous fruits.
SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY.
Clear and cool vreaXher prevailed during the
fore part of tbe wwk and cloudy, warm weath
er with showers during the latter. The rain
wax fairly heavy in the north portion and
hills with heavy enow in the Sierras, but in
the central and southern portions it was light.
It was very beneficial in all Factions and has
gr*At!v encouraped the farmers and orchard
iÂ»tÂ». The warm weather and rains have started
the erain and grass, and u-ith ordinary condi
tion* creea feed will soon be good. In the
northern portion summer-fallowed grain is
thrifty and looks fiae. and late sown grain is
c-zrAng up and is a. good stand. Pruning aad
Waning orchards and vineyards continue.
I>'tcJj*-Â» are l*>:ng cleaned and pomplng plants
put la condition. Young alfalfa is making
good jrrowth-
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.
â¢ The veathf-r was slightly warmer than dur
ing the preceding week, with considerable
cloudiress and light rain. At Santa. Maria the
mintall on the 12th and 13th was .75 of an
Jnch. but it was much lighter in Los Angeles
and "vicinity, and in Â»ome sections there was
non* Tbe rain of the preceding week was
vrry beneficial to erain. irrars and orchard*.
*ut more i* need#d Boon to insure crops. In
â¢ome actions tbe early sown grain 1* Â«p and
maki~E fair growth and pasturage has made a
pood etart. Plowing and Â«e*-d!ng are in
progreee and some farmer? will sow the usual
Ic^agr in praln. Orchards and vineyards are
generally in pood condition.
LOS ANGELES SUMMARY.
Grain and grass are beginning to sprout.
Vain at this time would do much goodâ eoften-
Srtbe top crust and helping young growth to
"me through. Green feed is starting in Xhe
â¢mountain sections and will Boon be good.

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Feb. 1G.â The amount of busi
i\pfz done in stocks to-day was slightly larger
than yesterday, but the character of the mar
ket was unchanged. All of the increase In
business was done in the first hour of the
market, the tales in that time reaching- al
most na many .-hares as for the whole day.
This business was a buying movement largely
confined to the Nt-w York public utilities, and
which was without explanation in any new
1 development. It was regarded as an effort
of the party leaders to awaken the market
into some animation and to start prices mov
ing. One or two railroad stocks were included
In the movement. It failed entirely to attract
any following and was abandoned, prices be
ing allowed to drift slowly back to last nights
level, or below it. when the traders took their
profits. United States preferred was heavy at
all times, and this helped to discourage the
attempts to lift prices. The selling of that
stocks had no other explanation than the
supposition that a rpeculatlve line was being
disposed of. Amalgtmated Copper teemed
also to suffer from some speculative profit
taking, but hardened after the announcement
of the declaration of a dividend of 510 per
share in Calumet and Hecla, which is double
the rate declared in the corresponding period
of last year. Wall street has an abundance
of war news, but the extraordinary military
and naval activity indicated In these market.-
see-ms to have little effect on prices. The
declining tendency of railroad earnings is a
subject of much discussion. Gross earnings
for the first week in February show declines
on the average .ind complaints by railroad offi
cials cf a continued Ftorm blockade point to
the continuance of this tendency. The fact
that the decrease from last year's, level is
more than accounted for by the decline in
earnings cf the trunk lines and EaFtern rail
roads Is a point in corrobcratlon of the conten
tion that storm blockades are the explanation
rather than a falling off in available traffic.
But the fact that the ratio of declines in earn
ings has shown steady progress elnee it began
last summer makes the subject one for mls-
The bond market was dull but steady. Total
sales. $1,295,000. United States bonds were
unchanged on the last call.

Chicago Board. of Trade.
Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, Feb. 16. â A change 4n rules gov- j
ernlng deliveries was largely responsible for :
heavy liquidation in wheat to-day, resulting :
in July closing 2<R2%c- below the final figures
of yesterday. May wheat closed ltt&l'/ic
down.
Demoralization was rampant in the wheat pit,
starting with confusion caused by the inaugu
ration of a new rule in reference to the de
livery of No. 1 and No. 2 hard wheat on fu
ture contracts. :. Until to-day No. 2 red and No.
1 and No. 2. hard winter wheat had been de
liverable on contract at 5c discount, but the
board voted to make the rate after July 1 at
2c discount. Announcement of this . decision
brought heavy realizing In the July and Sep
tember options.' Prices declined throughout thÂ«
day. The opening was comparatively steady,
influenced by the early Liverpool cables, which
showed a blight advance, initial quotations on
May being unchanged to y,c higher at B7%Â©
OSc. July was unchanged to %c lower at Â«Co
to 90tic Large quantities of July and Sep
tember wheat came out during the first hour"
on liberal Belling by commission houses and
local long*. Tnere was very little support to
the maTket and a decidedly weak tone soon de
veloped. T.*here was I ncthing ! apparent in the
general news to bring outside heavy selling or
ders.. Foreign advices .were still bullish on
the cash situation. Moreover, the cash demand
in all domestic markets was a noticeable fea
ture. Cold weather in the Southwest was also'
a bull factor. I In the face of these favorable
circumstances, however, 'long wheat continued
to come out in the entire day. The weakness
in the outside markets and in the corn and oats
Cits undoubtedly* had tome effect. It was also
claimed that a natural reaction from tha bull
ishness accounted for a considerable jiart of
th$ deprefcsion. The. close was â¢â , Â»ak and near
the bottom. After selling dotoii tp OttUc. or
l%c. below the high point. May closed at 9(iV4Â«j>

Corn met with a good demand at the open
ing from local â¢ traders. May closed ?iÂ«14c
lower at C6%<S5G%c. .
Oats were very nervous. May closing l%c
lower at 42", t.
There waj early strength In provisions, with
good buying of pork and ribs. Thb advance,
in prices, however, brought out heavy realiz
ing sales, which were increased by the ex
treme weakness in grains-. â¢ May pork closed

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
Although receipts of Potatoes were light,
being less than 500 sacks, the market was lib
erally supplied with all descriptions, which
have been accumulating for some time. Trade
was more active than for some little while
back, as the report that prices have advanced
at shipping points caused a better demand
%mong small dealers. Prices, however, were ;
unchanged. Garnet Chiles and Early Rose
were in good demand for seed and prices of '
the latter had a narrower range. Several :
cor Imk's of Burbanka have been received from
Â»< nila lately and they are selling at $1 Wi
1 15 ;-or cental, but are moving slowly, as
they do not compare favorably with the Ore
gon article, which can be had at almost the
same price. Sweets were unchanged and
rather dull. Strictly fancy Onions were firm
ly held at full figures, but the recent arrivals
of Oregon Included some off lots, which were
being offered at a decline.
As usual on Tuesday the receipts of VegeÂ«
tables from Los Angeles were light and of
ferings consisted chiefly of carried-over stock.
Peas and Tomatoes were still plentiful and
rather weak, but all other kinds ruled firm at
steady prices. Mushrooms were slightly weak
er under continued heavy receipts. A box of
Asparagus from the river sold at 50c per
pound and a box of extra fancy stock from
across the bay sold at 75c per pound.

Poultry and Game.
There was no Western Poultry received and
the receipts of domestic stock were unusually
light for Tuesday. The market ruled firm
and all kinds of Chickens were quoted higher,
supplies being insufficient to satisfy the de
mand. Old Pigeons and Ducks were In good
request and cleaned up. quickly at higher
rates. Receipts of Western stock are expected
to be light during the balance of the week,
and as there will be none in before Thurs
day all Indications point toward a continued
firm market. There were no dressed Turkeys
received.
The open season for wild Ducks and Doves
closed on Monday and the quotations are drop
ped. A few sacks that came In yesterday were
seized by the Game Wardens and what was
carried over from the preceding day had to
be dumped. Geese. Snipe and Rabbits ar
rived freely and were readily, marketed at
firmer rates. â . ' ' . . -

Butter, Cheese and Eggs, s
--.There was no'noteworthy variation In Butter.
The question of price was largely a question of
stock. If a dealer was heavily, supplied he
offered his floor at 25c; another, carrying light
stocks, asked 26c, and even 27c tn Â«. Â«maJl wÂ»v ]
for preferred brands. But the great bulk of I
the Butter selling to-day ts at the quotations j
below, and the market is top-heavy at them.
Tht-re Is no further change of consequence In j
Cheese, stocks being; as large and cumbersome
as ever and the demand as light.
Eggs are coming In more ireely. as will be
seen below, and the situation is as stated for
a week or two past, the cheaper descriptions
being Jn lively demand for local and shipping
use, \rt-.Ue the fine ranch are given the go-by.
They are accumulating and are beginning to
weoken off again in consequence. ,

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits. "
There was a little better feeling in the
Orange market owing to clear.' sunny weather
and trade was moderately active. Stocks,
however, were still very heavy and prices werÂ«
without quotable variance. Occasional small
lots of large Navels, that is. 06s and 112s. sold
up to $2 25, but the top quotation was con
sidered an extreme figure for the general mar
ket. Six cars of Navels are announced for to- â¢
day's auction. Tangerines are in free supply
and weaker now that the Chinese New Tear
festivities are abcut over. Grape Fruit is
easier under increased receipts, while Lemons i
and Limes are unchanged. Ripe Bananas are !
in good supply and move fairly at previous
prices. The steamer Alameda, which arrived !
from Honolulu yesterday, brought up 525D
bunches Bananas and 33 crates Pineapples.

products being lower. Lard, pure and com- t

Hams. Bacon and barreled goods is dull, with |

Hops 6how no further change, but are quiet
er and featureless, with stocks of the 1903 crop
reduced to a .small quantity, and this in lots
scattered here and there.
Wool is dull and nominal. Last year's clip
is pretty well cleaned up and the new spring
clip will not appear until next month, so there
is practically no market at present.
Hides are steady at previous prices. The
Oriental war has had the effect of Imparting
a steadier tone to the situation without, how

STUDIES CULTURE OF
RUBBER TREES ABROAD
IT. C Pearson, a Recognized Author
ity. Returns From Plantations of
Ceylon and Straits Settlement.
Henry C. Pearson, editor and pub
lisher of the India Rubber World of
Xew York, is at the Palace, having
just returned from the island of Cey
lon and the .Straits Settlement, where
he inspected the comparatively new
rubber industries of those countries.
Discussing his trip yesterday Mr.
Pearron said he was much impressed
with the development of rubber cul
ture there.
"In Ceylon." said he. "the coffee bug
has played havoc with the coffee plan
tations, and many of the planters, as
well as tea men, have gone into the
rubber industry with considerable suc
cess. The industry is still very young
there, but the quality of rubber being
produced is of a high quality. The
export of the product last year was
about 40.000 pounds and the bulk of
it went to the Liverpool market."
Editor Pearson Is regarded as one
of the highest authorities on rubber
in this country. Last year he in
spected the rubber plantations of Mex
ico and through his paper he has fur
nished the American people much val
uable information regarding the pro
duct and the development of the in
dustry in various parts of the world.
He is now en route to New York.

DECLARES BOND
ISSUE ILLEGAL
Herbert E. Law Claims the
Supervisors Have No Right
to Raise Funds in Such a Way
The threatened suit to test the valid
ity of the action of the Board of Super
visors in providing for the issuance of
518,000,000 worth of bonds to raise funds
for the improvement of the city, voted
for at the last election, was commenced
yesterday by Herbert E. Law, one of
the biggest land owners in the city.
It is in the nature of a suit for an in
junction restraining the board from is
suing the bonds on the ground that the
issuance of bonds is beyond the powers
of the board and therefore illegal. With'
the filing of the complaint a temporary
injunction was issued by Judge Sloss.
returnable before him Friday.
The complaint contains ten different
causes of action, one being directed
against each particular purpose for
which the bonds are to be issued. It is
claimed that the bonds for the hospital
and the nine other objects are invalid
for the reason that ordinance No. 1114
violates the provisions of section .21,
chapter 1^. article II of the charter, be
cause the ordinance purports to legis
late on ten different subjects, whereas
the title embraces but one subject.
It is also charged that there is a dis
crepancy between ordinance No. 1114
and the notice of election, in this: that
the ordinance provides for a certain
number of bonds of a certain denom
ination, and the notfrce of election pro
vides for a different number of bonds
of such denomination.
QUESTIONS SCHOOL BONDS.
Law complains also that the issuance
of bonds for school purposes violates
the general law of the State, because
the Political Code and the statutes, of
the State each provide a full and com
plete scheme for the issuance of bonds
for school purposes, and education be
ing a "State affair." and not a "local
affair," the charter is in conflict with
the general law of the State, and there
fore void in that respect.
It is further charged that all of the
provisions for the purchase of real es
tate for hospital, for County Jail and
additions to the Hall of Justice, for
public parks and for school purposes
being more than $50,000 in value are
void, as violative of that section of the
charter which requires such a proposi
tion to be submitted to the electors
after the passage of the ordinance pro
viding for their purchase. The portion
of the charter claimed to be violated
by these proceedings is section 21, chap
ter I, article II.
The complaint closes with the charge
that there is no provision of law or
warrant in the title for the purchase of
parks for children's playgrounds. Also
that the purchase of Telegraph Hill
park did not receive the proper num
ber of votes. ' ;
SLOSS WILL HEAR CASE.
All of the proceedings of the Board
of Supervisors, by ordinance and by
resolution, as well as those of the Elec
tion Commissioners, are set forth at
length as exhibits to the complaint,
they being thirty in number.
Judge Kerrigan assigned the case to
Judge Sloss, and on application of the
attorneys for the plaintiff Judge Sloss
issued an order to show cause', directed
to the city and county of San Fran
cisco, the Board of Supervisors and the
Mayor, requiring them to show cause
before him, in Department 8, on
Friday next why an injunction should
not issue according to the prayer of the
complaint, and in the meantime he is
sued an order restraining the Board of
Supervisors and the Mayor and the city
from taking further steps In the prem
ises. The Board of Supervisors, the
Mayor and the City Attorney were all
served promptly.

Law. and associated with him is Edgar
C. Chapman, Law's regular
A similar test was made in 1900 of the
bond issue voted upon Just before the
new charter went into effect. In that
instance the amount of the bond issue
was $11,000,000. Eugene N. Fritz was
the plaintiff in that case and Arthur
H. Barendt was his attorney. The Su
preme Court held all Jhe bond issues
illegal.

EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF
THE CITIZENS' ALLIANCE
OF SAN FRANCISCO.
Herbert George, the originator of the
Citizens' Alliance, has accepted an of
fer to come to San Francisco to act as
the executive officer of the Citizens'
Alliance in this city. An item* was pub
lished yesterday to the effect that Col
onel John P. Irish had been invited to
hold the position of executive officer,
but that he had declined. This is con
firmed by Leon Sloss, who also says
that Herbert George has accepted a
proposition that has been made to him.
He will assume his new position as
soon as he can make his arrangement".
Herbert George has been recently In
San Francisco. He conceived the idea
of forming the Citizens' Alliance, so
he has publicly stated, as the result
of a controversy between striking min
ers and the owners of mines in Colo
rado. He proceeded to form a new or
ganization on the basis of methods that
had been adopted by trades unions,
with individual membership.cards, etc.,
as described by him in interviews for
the newspapers and as he also has as
serted in public speeches. He organized
the Citizens' Alliance in San Francisco
and has also formed branches of the
same body in other localities in Cali
fornia. He. is th.e principal stockholder
in the Union Mining and Fluxing Com
pany, having quarries in Colorado
Utah and Wyoming. He It. the pro
prietor and editor of a weekly paper
that is published by him in Denver
the majn purpose of which appears to
be to give information publicly about
the Citizens' Alliance.

Why the Store Is Continually Crowded
Since the great retiring sale in furni
ture, -carpets, draperies, etc., has com
menced at Pattosien Company, corner Six
teenth and Mission streets, the store has
been and is continually crowded with bar
gain seekers. Some cannot understand
why it is so, considering the dull times
just now. The fact is. people are now
saving $40 on every $100 invested. They
therefore deem it advisable to buy now,
even if they cannot use the articles for
a few months to come. â¢

SAYS HIS FINE
WAS UNLAWFUL
Angelo Brizzolara Sues the
Justice of the Peace and
a Constable â¢ of Sausalito
The suit of Angelo Brizzolara, an
Italian laborer, against Justice of the
Peace J. H. Prior, and i Constable J.
Hannon of Sausallto, which has been
commenced in the United States Circuit
Court, is likely to develop into interest
ing litigation. Brizzolara was sum
moned as a juror in a trial pending
before the Justice and refused to at
tend, informing the constable that he
was not a citizen of the country. A
bench warrant brought him before
Prior and the latter imposed a fine of
$3 for contempt of court. Brizzolara
paid the money and now wants the
Justice and the constable to pay him
$2000 damages. .
According to the complaint filed by
the plaintiff in the case he was ap
proached by Constable Hannon on De
cember 22 of last year and ordered to
appear for jury duty in an action that
had been brought in the Sausalito
township. He informed the official that
he was a citizen of Italy and conse
quently disqualified as a juror in this
land. He failed to attend the case and
Justice Prior issued an attachment, on
which he was arrested and taken into
court. After being found guilty of con
tempt he was given the alternative of
paying a fine or remaining ten days
in jail. He paid the cash and now
alleges that he was unjustly fined and
asks that monetary restitution be made.
Attorney Charles A. Garter, who ap
pears for the defendants, filed an an
swer yesterday, saying that malicious
prosecution, as the complaint would in
dicate, could not be proven. It Is his
contention that Brizzolara should have
obeyed the . spmmons and made what
ever explanation he had to make to
the Judge himself. Instead of parleying
over the matter with the constable.
