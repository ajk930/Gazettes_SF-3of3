NEW YORK, Nov. 7.â A letter writ

in London to Dr. Homer Gibney of this
city, in which she said she was "enjoy
ing herself immensely," was read at to
day's taking of testimony for the con
test over Miss Dolbeer's will. Counsel
for the contestants objected to the ad
mission of the letter as evidence. The
examination will be continued to-mor
row. ' ; Â¦Â¦Â¦:.-.Â¦ WS8S8BBB&BBK&
Tho opening statement ended, Mrs.
Millie Scott Biven of Oakland was
called as the first witness and she tes
tified as to- the insanity of Miss Dol
beer's mother and the fact that Mrs.
Dolbeer was afflicted with a peculiar
pain in the head, insomnia and mel
ancholia at the time of her daughter's
birth. The mother had been taken to
Stockton by her husband and later, on
her return home, procured a pistol and
shot herself dead. Bertha was two
years of age at that time.
The decree of distribution of the es
tate of John Dolbeer was Introduced in
evidence, showing that Miss Dolbeer
inherited property valued approximate
ly at $1,100,000.
Raymond H- Sherman- was next
called to pfove that his wife was out
of the State, having departed last
Thursday after a subpena had been
served on her by proponents. The con
testant was then allowed to read Mrs.
Sherman's deposition. The burden of
her testimony was that she had noticed
a great change in her cousin's condi
tion in her last year. Miss Dolbeer
was unusually listless, became very
thin and was* much depressed. Her
eyes were heavy and wholly without
animation, she "had little to say for
herself, looked sad," and "displayed no
feeling in taking leave to go to Eu
rope."
Mrs. Mary Ribbey, who answered
that she was employed as foster
mother for Bertha Dolbeer. in 1878 and
1879, told of the Insanity of Mrs. Dol
beer and of her suicide.
The trial will be resumed to-morrow.

she sailed on. Johnson said, would tes
tify that during the voyages she acted
strangely and talked irrationally. And
finally, after Miss Dolbeer, while suf
fering from aberration of mind, ended
her life by tragic suicide. Miss Warren
herself told the Coroner of New York
that her ward had been Insane for
some time, and to the detective detailed
to investigate the case made the state

that the derangement of mind would
l^ad Miss Dolbeer to take ner own life.
MOTHER SHOT HERSELF.
Mrs. J. L. Moody, an aunt of Miss
Dolbeer. Johnson proceeded, would tes
tify that on April 24. the day after the
will was made, the decedent was seized
with a paroxysm and uttered cries of
despair, that clearly indicated that the
mind was gone. It was plain that her
intellect was clouded, that her view of
life and things was distorted and that
she' was utterly incapable of executing
a will.
Mies Dolbeer then took the trip to
Europe, accompanied Â¦ by | her constant
companion, Miss Warren, on - the ad-
The opening statement for the con
testant was made by Hiram Johnson,
who ft forth his case with clarity and
conciseness. He said the contestant
would show that Miss Dolbeer was of
unsound mind when she made a will
wherein the closest of her kin were not
mentioned and the greater part of the
estate she had inherited from her
father was bequeathed to Miss War
ren; to whom she was bound by no tie
of consanguinity. It would be proved,
he declared, that her insanity was
hereditary! for her mother had com
mitted suicide while insane and mem
bers of her father's family had. been
committed to asylums. Then the death
of Miss Dolbeer's brother, resulting
frcm a runaway accident, her father's
death and other circumstances of her
life had aided to bring on melancholia,
frcm which she was suffering in acute
form when she executed her testament
and wh?n she flung herself from the
window in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel
in New York four months later. Â¦
AFFLICTED AS WAS HER MOTHER
It would be proved, the attorney
continued, that Miss Dolbeer was suf
fering from a peculiar pain in the back
of the head, with a falling of the eyes,
insomnia and all the symptoms of mel
ancholia, such as her mother suffered
before her death. Early in the present
year it had become necessary to pre
scribe opiates for Miss Dolbeer that she
might sleep. She had become more and
more depressed, indifferent to the
world, absolutely indifferent to life,
grown thinner and thinner, a pallor set
tled on her countenance and melancho
lia, the most insidious form of insanity,
had developed in strong degree.
glances of the audience. Her refined
face told plainly of her recent illness.
Her nervousness was apparent and she
could not repress a few tears. She was
dressed in mourning, giving emphasis
to saddened though comely features.
The modest, shrinking woman seemed
far out of place as the center of the
war the lawyers were waging at the
bar with loud voice and many an angry
quip.
MISS WARREN* TIMID.
Miss Warren, lifelong companion of
Mies Dolbeer and chief beneficiary in
the testament; was in court yesterday,
UÂ»e first time she has appeared since
the suit which seeks to deprive her of
about $850,000 was instituted. She was
accompanied by her nurse. Miss Alex
ander of New York, who came to San
Francisco with her when the remains
of Miss Dolbeer were brought across
the continent for interment. Seated
on the other Bide was a half-sister
MIsb Stuart, of this city. The experi
ence of coming to court was a new one
for Miss Warren and it was with dif
ficulty that the courtroom was found
among the dark corridors of the puz
zling City Hall.

â¢chander's attorneys announced that
BOTT.e of their most important evidence
would be declarations by Miss Etta M.
Warren herself as to the insanity of
Miss Dolbeer, but when it came to the
reading of the deposition of a New
York detective who says they were
made to him, Judge Coffey refused to
admit the testimony.
One of the strongest witnesses for
the contestant, Mrs. Raymond H. Sher
man, who is a daughter of Mrs. J. L.
Moody, left last Thursday for the East,
but her testimony had been taken in a
deposition and this was read to the
Jury. Unlike Schander, who scarcely
ever held a conversation with Miss Dil
beer. and to whom th*Â» testatrix was
virtually a stranger, though he was h?r
ur.cle, Mrs. Sherman was on terms of
intimacy with her cousin and was in a
position to speak intelligently on her
condition at the time the will was ex
ecuted. But Mrs. Sherman's evidence
T.-as hardly of a strongly convincing
character. The most she could say was
that "a change came over Miss Dol
beer in the last year, she looked sad
and appeared indifferent to anybody or
anything or to life." The witness had
never seen any act or heard any^words
that v.ould firmly establish the fact of
an unbalanced mind.
The battle over the $1,000,000 estate
of Miss Bertha M. Dolb<?**r began in
earnest yesterday. The array of legal
talent at last settled down to the com
bat before jury and court and the at

ticket that Judge Herrick will be
elected and that a situation will be
disclosed on election night similar to
that, of 1888, when Harrison, Repub

his own administration and the record
of Higgins and declared he would make

the polls close. While the Democratic
managers profess to be equally con
fident as the Republican managers of
the State for their; national ticket, the
stock market failed to show a tremor
of uneasiness at a prospect of a change
in the national administration. The
business interests of the. country all
appear to regard the election of
Roosevelt as a foregone conclusion
and as a satisfactory outcome. The
market showed considerable advances
and great strength. This was more
marked than in 1900 and different
from the condition which prevailed In
1^96, when so much was at stake in
the business world in the East that
many persons desisted from trading
and waited with bated breath for the
announcement of the returns. The
market, however, has advanced before

NEW,: YORK, Nov. 7. â There ' is
every prospect of a tremendous vote
being cast at to-morrow's election in

was little evidence of the close of the
political campaign, unless it. might be
found ;in the' absence of familiar faces
about, the national and State head
quarters and hotels. There was noth
ing that indicated any excitement or
undue interest, and. in fact, the politi
cal headquarters, both national and
State, showed little of the activity that
has been noticeable up to the end of
last week. Nothing that either cam
paign committee could do at this late
day, it was recognized, would affect the
result; and this accounted in part for
the quietude, it being well known that
the case had been closed and had gone
to the great American jury.
The extreme quiet of headquarters
was apparent also at the hotels â and
those haunts where politicians often
congregate to discuss the prospects of
the different candidates were- deserted
nearly all day by the men who are
most interested in the elections.
âElection returns will be received at
all the headquarters. Chairman Cor
telyou will go to Hempstead, Long
Island, to vote and upon his return will
remain at the committee room
throughout the evening.
Vice Chairman Nicoll, Chairman
Sheehan of the executive committee
and Secretary Woodson will receive the
returns at Democratic National Com

Chairman Cord Meyer and other
Democratic State committeemen will
be at the Hoffman House. William

CHICAGO, Nov. 7. â Betting on the
result of the election was quite brisk
to-night in some of the downtown
hotels. The largest wager of the even
ing was made by a number of Board
of Trade men against James O'Leary,
a bookmaker, the brokers offering $50,
000 on Roosevelt against $7500 on Park
er. H. Dryer of New York made a bet
of $5000 to $1000 on Roosevelt. The name
of the taker of the Parker end could
not be learned. These were the largest
bets made during the evening, but
many small ones were made, the pre
vailing odds being on Roosevelt at 5
to 1. A number of wagers were made
on the result in New York at 2 to 1 that
it would go Republican on the vote for
President.
A good deal of money was put up in
$50 and $100 bets in Considine's place,
with odds on Roosevelt carrying the
State at 10 to 7. This was the price
wherever there was any betting in the
tenderloin. There was little Higgins
money in evidence, the odds on Herrick
being 10 to 6. Betting continued active
until the close and was attended by a
good deal of excitement.
A. G. Wood offered to wager $1000 to
$1200 that Roosevelt would not carry
New York, New Jersey and Connecti
cut. He could not find any takers. Late
this afternoon there was a great deal
of Parker money offering at 1 to 6, but
the Roosevelt backers were offering
only 5 to 1, although some small bets
were made at 6 to 1.
Up town little money was wagered.
Old-timers declared on Broadway and
Sixth avenue that a duller election was
never remembered.
Money was freely offered at odds of 2
to 1 that Roosevelt would carry the
State, while the betting on the Gov
ernorship result opened at 2 to 1 ' on
Herrlck, bets of varying amounts be
ing closed later at odds ranging from
4 to 10 to 6 to 10 on Herrick.
It is estimated that J5.000.000 has been
placed on deposit by bettors. One trust
company holds $2,500,000. One big bet
was closed before noon at odds of 6*4
to 1. The $5000 Roosevelt money in this
bet was offered by Frederick H. Brooks.
It was covered by Sheffield & McCul
lough, who put up $S0O on Parker.
The betting ring in the curb market
was an exciting place to-day, as out
side brokers deserted business in stocks
to get down, as far as they were able,
belated wagers.
NEW YORK. Nov. 7.â Excepting at
jthe longest of odds â odds that have
never before been witnessed in' Presi
dential betting in Wall streetâ no Park
er funds were forthcoming in to-day's
closing betting on the campaign. The
length of the odds, however, tempted
some bettors to try "long shots" upon
the Democratic candidate.
The Socialists have held more meet

to-night were more optimistic than any that have heretofore reached the President. The party man
agers are confident that Roosevelt will sweep the entire North, and that he will receive a record
breaking popular vote. Not a single State outside of the South is conceded to Parker. The one obstacle to
Republican success â the danger of over confidence â has been removed by the energetic efforts of the cam
paign committees in the past few days, and the full strength of the party will be voted at the polls. It is no
longer feared that control of the House of Representatives will be lost; in fact, the Republican majority in the

SAN BERNARDINO, Nov. 7.â Word
was received here to-night that the
body of Roy Jeffers, the â¢ young man
who disappeared from Highland, near
this city, a few weeks ago, has been
found in a lake near St. Louis, Mo. The
body bears marks of violence.
Jeffers had been in the employ of the
Brookings Lumber Company here for
some time, and when he had saved up
several hundred dollars he left, with
the avowed intention of returning to
his parents at Greenville, Ky. Some
days later an inquiry was received
from the parents in Kentucky asking
what had become of the young man.
This county was searched from end to
end, but no trace of him was found.
Jeffers was one *bf the most popular
young men of this section, and the
news of his untimely death has been
received with general sorrow. The tele
gram conveying the news of his death
does not go into details, simply stating
that the body bore evidence of foul
play.
NEW YORK. Not. 7.â When Presi

Island Railroad Station to-morrow, hÂ«
may meet with the same difficulty In
reaching his home at Oyster Bay that
those who live In the suburbs In Long
Island did to-day. The entire Long
Island system was tied up for several
hours this afternoon and lats at night
the trouble had. not been overcome.
The new switching device that re
cently had been Installed was out of
working order and the railroad officials
endeavored to get the 100 or more mm,
who had been relieved from duty to
return to their switches. This they re
fused to do and the result was that
thousands of Long Islanders were com
pelled to remain in the depots or to
seek their homes by some circuitous
route.
President Roosevelt on his war to
Oyster Bay will have to pass through
the yards which to-night were badly
blocked. One of the officials of the
road said, howevtr: "The President

Taggart Continues to Profess Con
fidence of a Parker Victory.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Nov. 7.âUn
usual quiet prevails throughout In
diana on the eve of the election. The
Republican leaders refuse to change
their prediction that Roosevelt and
Fairbanks will carry inaiaiia by plu
ralities variously estimated at from 20,
000 to 35,000. Democratic leaders con
fidently assert their belief that Parker
and Davis will be successful in Indiana
but refuse to give figures.
The Democrats are also of the opin
ion that John Kern, their gubernator
ial candidate, will run ahead of the na
tional ticket; that there will be much
change in the complexion of Indiana's
representation in Congress and that the
next Legislature which, if the Repub
lican national ticket is successful, will
elect two United States Senators, will
be Democratic.
Republicans scoff at such opinions,
contending that the next Indiana Leg
islature will be overwhelmingly Re
publican and that two Republican Con
gressmen from the Sixth and Twelfth
districts will be added to the present
number of nine. J. Frank Hanley, Re
publican candidate for Governor, is
sanguine in his expectation of election.*
He is of the opinion that his reported
connection with legislation Inimical to
labor has not influenced his candidacy
adversely. At Republican State head
quarters it is believed that Hanley will
poll a vote equal to that of the national
ticket.
When asked to-night for a last word
concerning the outlook Democratic Na
tional Chairman Taggart replied:
"Indiana is reliably Democratic and
the vote will so show."
Republican State Chairman James P.
Goodrich sees a Republican majority of
30,000 and the re-election of a Republi
can Legislature.
It Is conceded that the Prohibition
vote in Indiana will be increased this
year, but this contingency is not ex
pected to give either the Republicans
or Democrats an advantage. The Popu
list vote is expected to exert less influ
ence than previously.
Harry S. New returned to-day from
Republican Western headquarters at
Chicago. He will vote to-morrow and
return immediately to Chicago, where
he will receive the returns. In an in
terview to-night he said:
"I' honestly believe that we shall car
ry Indiana by a majority equal if not
surpassing that of 1900. We shall elect
the entire Republican State ticket and
carry both branches of the State Leg
islature. We shall certainly elect nine
Congressmen, and I am confident of
electing two more. I think Gilbert has
got Robinson beaten in the Twelfth dis
trict.
"I think Roosevelt will not have few
er than 315 votes in the electoral col
lege, and I shall not be surprised if he
gets 320. He will surely carry Connec
ticut and New Jersey. Chairman Cor
telyou has left Nevada out of his cal
culations as a Republican State, but I
am convinced that Roosevelt will carry
it. Thevchances are In our favor in
New York. If Parker ever had any
chance he destroyed it by his actions
in the final hours of the campaign.
There never was any doubt that he
would be beaten, but he let all of the
wind out of his balloon when he made
his bitter attack on President Roose
velt."

COLORED CITIZENS MEET.
I want to impifss it on the
minds of all Republicans that
to srivc me the full powers to
carry out the policy of the
Republican party, they must
give me a supporting delega
tion hi Congress. What Is the
use of electing me If my hands
are to be tied by a Demo
cratic House? Why two
years from now, if I have not
the full control of that house,
it will be Impossible to carry
out the policy for the reason
that the appropriations for
Improvements for the army
posts and to the navy may be
cut down, as well as appro
priations'for our fortifications.
Then there is the Philippine
policy, which will be af
fected. Everj- man who wants
to see me in the chair should
vote for a Republican Con

RENO, Nov. 7.â The hardest fought
campaign in the history of Nevada
closed to-night with speaking in near

Republicans have for the first time in
ten years more than an even chance of
winninjj the whole State ticket, while
the Democratic leaders admit that
Roosevelt will carry the State. The
election of United States Senator and

at the meeting held on October 31, 1004. At
that meeting there were present fifty or sixty
members of the membership of 1400 men. The
statement that the resolution was passed over
whelmingly is utterly false. It was strenu
ously opposed and carried In the face of strong
opposition, even from the ranks of "the picked
meeting. The members of the union had no
knowledge that such a resolution was to be
passed, and if any fair proportion of the mem

never have been introduced, much less car
ried. The persons who railroaded its passage
compose a email clique made up of men who
have resided In our city for a few years, and
have been solely responsible for the dissen

In their resolution. The statements that Julius
Kahn is an enemy of union labor and the

the Citizens' Alliance by sending strike
breakers to Sacramento to take the places of

an act of malicious politics, accompllehed on

Rev. Mr. Burleigh called the atten
tion of his hearers to what the Repub
lican party had done for the colored
people in the past, dating his remarks
from the time of Lincoln to the pres
ent administration. He urged his
hearers not to forget the fair and
liberal treatment accorded them.
Julius Kahn in his address touched
briefly but pointedly on the race ques
tion: "The Republican party," he
said, "has always stood for protection,
sound money, sound morals and equal
opportunities to all men, regardless of
race, creed or color."
Touching his own candidacy, Kahn
had little to say. He pointed to his
record, which he deemed sufficient evi
dence of his capability to represent
the people of a great State in the halls
of the governing body of the nation.
"In politics as in law," he said, "three
things are resorted to: First, we use
facts if we have them; failing in facts,
we use law, and if we have neither
facts nor law we abuse our opponent.
The Democratic party, having neither
facts nor law, is abusing its opponent.

McKIXLiAY GIVEN OVATION.
On the eve of the election the Re
publican leaders claim Tolo County
for Roosevelt by a small margin.
The county gave Bryan 260 plurality
and Congressman Bell a plurality of
355. The latte'r's vote, they claim,
will be reduced in proportion to the
slump on the head of the ticket. The
Republicans also claim the election of
an Assemblyman and two of the three
Supervisors. The Democratic leaders
are exceedingly reticent regarding the>
head of the ticket, but claim Bell's
majority in Tolo will be as large as
that two years ago. With equal con
fidence they claim the election of the
Assemblyman and all three Super
visors.
WOODLAND, Nov. 7. â The Repub

paign here to-night with an enthu

V. Eddy of San Francisco was the prin
cipal speaker. Local candidates also
made addresses.
Republican Leaders Claim County by
Small Margin.
This concluded the speeches and the
last Republican meeting of the cam
paign came to an end with cheers for
the candidates from Roosevelt down the
line. * **
And in concluding I .want to ask you to
think of the dark hours of Cleveland's second
administration. Think of that and then look
forward to the unclouded promise of the fu
ture. Think of the leaders that led. you from
the darkness of despair into the light of prog
ress; think of the policies that have enriched
the nation. Democratic prophecies and prom
ises are as substantial as the fabled gold at
the rainbow's end; as substantial as the pal
aces the mirage rears on the waterless des
ert. Be- guldfd alone by the light of expe
rience. This will lead you to the right path
and you will cast your vote for the Republican
party.
Every man in this district is interested in
the candidacy of Mr. Hayes, because he ie the
only candidate in the district whose politics
would lead htm to uphold the hands of the
next President of the United States, Theodore
Roosevelt. The Interests of California are en
twined with those of every State in the Union,
and none is more vitally interested in the per
petuation of Republican policies than Is the
great, imperial State of California.
Republlcpn success means business success;
solid, solvent banks. Increasing deposits, sound
currency and a continuation of that "great pol
icy of protection (not for tariff alone, but pro
tection for the American manufacturer and
American workman) which is responsible for
the present unprecedented prosperity of the na
tion.
ing had been the scene of many a gory

after the referee has given his decision,

lican, E. A. Hayes, and the entire Re
publican ticket of the district will be
declared the victors in this great con
test." Cheers greeted this remark-

These remarks of Mr. Hayes oc
casioned prolonged applause. In con
clusion the speaker made an exhaustive

pledged himself to work tirelessly,

nese exclusion but to stay the tide of
Japanese emigration into the United
States. 'Â¦Â¦V' : i
Turning a moment from national to local
questions, I wish to tell you of a condition
that has attracted my attention. I notice that
at the Iron works of this city there are no keels
of new war vessels being laid. Notwithstand
ing the fact that new ships are constantly be
ing built by the Government, it is evident that
San Franclcco is being neglected In the award
of the contracts. Why is this? The reason is
that during the last session cf CongreBS San
Francisco was represented by men not in sym
pathy with th<Â» administration. San Francisco
had no Republican Congressmen to work for
its interests and hence they suffered. Get one
big ship to build here and It means that most
of her cost will go into the hands of the city's
workmen. I will promise you that if I am
elected I will do my best to see that San Fran
cisco gets one big ship. If not two or three, to
build.
I have not spent my time abusing my oppo
nents, but In appealing to the sober sense of
my fellow men as to what they should do to
uphold the great principles of the Republican
party and continue the era of prosperity we
have known during the years of Republican
administration.
NO TIME FOR ABUSE.
While it is true that I have been wantonly
assailed during this campaign, I have full con
fidence In submitting my candidacy to the peo
ple that they will rise above the petty abuses
that have been heaped upon me and will vote
as men, unswerved by charges against me
which they know to be false. I know that
the people do not believe that I am such a
monster that I would say one thing and do
another, and I know they will accept as false
the assertion that this is my practice.
After a strenuous campaign we meet here to
night a few hours before the battle of the bal
lots to have a final talk on the Issues of the
campaign. Some may think that this Is a late
hour In the campaign to continue the fight, but
it is never too late, if the voting places have
not opened, to try to lead eome voter to accept
the right view of the condition that con
fronts us. ...
John W. Rogers, chairman of the
Fifth Congressional District Commit
tee, presided. The principal speakers
were E. A. Hayes, Republican candi
date for Congress in the Fifth, and
Samuel M. Shortridge, whose eloquence
is known wherever audiences gather.
After a song by the Stanford Repub
lican Quartet Mr. Hayes was intro
duced, and he made a very effective ad
dress. In part he said:
The meeting was the most enthusi
astic of the campaign. Shortly after
the speakers arrived, but before the
meeting was called to order, the Greek-
American Republican Club, hundreds
strong, headed by Felix Paduveri and
preceded by a band, from which rolled
the majestic strains of "The Star-
Spangled Banner," marched into the
hall. The demonstration had its effect
and the crowd rose and fitted the hall
with cheers for the organized legion of
loyal Republicans.

This hi doubtless only one of a number of
schemes to which the opposition may resort in
a final effort to affect the result. Without
doubt there will be the usual number -of false
stories circulated too late to be denied or coun
teracted. While the American people are to
an extent prepared for such methods, it Is, of
course, necessary that we should be on the
alert. It Is rate to assume that any stories
put into circulation during: the last few days
of the campaign are intended to mislead the
people and are promulgated at the last hour in
the â¢ hope that Â¦' we will not have the time or
the opportunity to prove their falsity.
We wish to bring this matter to your special
attention. Very truly yours.

Secretary Republican National, Committee.
He next spoke of Hearst's efforts to I
suppress trusts and the Republicans' j
evasion of their responsibility. After f
talking for several minutes on trusts '
he switched back to attacking Julius
Kahn and ridiculing his personal char
acteristics. Following a particularly
slurring remark he added that he "did ]
not think Julius Kahn was in any way i
corrupt." j
William J. Wynn, candidate for re- |
election to Congress from the Fifth
District, next spoke. In a few words
he asked for the support of the Demo- j
cratic voters at the polls and prom
ised that he would do all in his power
to further their interests.
P. H. McCarthy then followed with
a description of a supposed attempt by
two Republicans In a buggy to run j
down Livernash and Wynn at an open :
air meeting on Market street. He ac
ciTsed Presidential elector U. S. Grant j
of being the instigator of the attack. ;
His speech was mostly confined to the :
discussion of the labor relations with ,
the Democratic party.
Edward J. Livernash was the final
speaker of the evening. He began with
an attack on Julius Kahn, Republican
nominee in the Fourth Congressional
District. He said that his opponent
had descended to depths of infamy
never before reached, and far lower
than the level of the last campaign.
He spoke of the principles that "he
would fight for in Congress in spite
of the assaults of hired thugs and
against votes washed down with "can
didate" beer, and in spite of the Citi
zens' Alliance or even of a- dastard
press, always a purchasable quantity.
The next few minutes were devoted
to an attack on Abraham Ruef, the
Congressman alleging that an agree
ment had been made* between Ruef and
E. A. Hayes, Republican nominee in
the Fifth Congressional District, to
defeat Wynn. Livernash closed with
an appeal for the party's support at
the polls to-day.
James H. Budd was the first speaker
introduced and began by arraigning
Kahn in mud-flinging terms for fling
ing mud. He branched out, however,
with figures and predictions of to-day's
voting. He also claimed that the Dem
ocrats did not desire to abolish the
tariff, but regulate it, and that the
reason why the Democrats were in the
minority was because men after boodle
would not stay with the minority. He
then referred to 1 trusts' and said that
they were the result of Republican ad
ministration and that hard times were
inevitable' during Cleveland's adminis
tration after Harrison was out.
Campaign issues, the affairs of the
Â¦nation and clean politics were forgot
ten last night at Pioneer Hall, where
the Democrats held a rally meeting at
which ex-Governor Budd and Congress
men Livernash and Wynn were the
chief speakers. Budd and Livernash,
together with P. J. McCarthy, who is
a Democrat by the grace of union
labor, descended to vituperation and
Invective and discussed the character,
manners and alleged immorality of
their Republican opponents, while the
questions of trusts, expansion and tar
iff were given but brief courtesv.
The presiding officer was Walter
Macarthur, who occupied many min
utes with an introductory address and
later, during a lull in the proceedings,
while waiting for the Democratic Con
gressional candidates, came bravely to
the rescue with, a 'talk on legislation.
He asserted that this was a party, not
a class, fight and was soon contradicted
by a subsequent speaker, who appealed
to the audience to support Democracy
as the champion of the poor against
the rich.

. ST. PETERSBURG, Nov. 7.â The
necessity for officers for service at the
front has resulted in the mobilization
of all officers in St. Petersburg,. Vilna,
Warsaw, Kieff, Odessa, Moscow, Kazan
and the Caucasus. The loss of officers
at Liaoyang and below Mukden was
about 1300. The mobilization, while
intended to supply the deficiency, is
necessitated also by the grand scale
on which the war in the Far East is to
be prosecuted.
The news from the front indicates
that General Kuropatkin is devoting
his attention chiefly to keeping the
Japanese busy along the line of their
fortifications below the Shakhe River.
The Russians apparently are enjoying
some superiority in the matter of artil
lery, as many of the' heavier field

NAGASAKI, Nov. 7.â Edward Emer
son Jr., correspondent of the Chicago
Daily News, is the latest war writer to
have run the Japanese blockade and
enter besieged Port Arthur. Emerson
has Just returned and.gives an interest
ing description of conditions in the be
leaguered stronghold, which he left Just
previous to the recent general assault.
He says:
"After having arrived, ; along with a
companion, at the lighthouse on Liao
ehan promontory, close to Port Arthur,
the boat in which we had sailed from
Miaotao Islands was picked up by a
small Russian torpedo-boat attached to
the battleship Peresviet and towed to
that vessel, which lies two miles out
side of the harbor. The Peresviet is as
badly battered by Japanese shells as
the Cesarevltch. Both ship and crew
were in a filthy condition. From the
Peresviet we were taken to Admiral
Wiren, who was on board the Bayan,
outside of the Tigers Tail. The Bayan
also was badly damaged and dirty.
HIGH HONOR FOR DEWEV.
Later in the night the advanced posi
tion of the Japanese was taken and re
taken twice. The besiegers succeeded
in holding the approaches and con
structing trenches connecting them
with the army's front parallel. At
dawn numbers of dead were visible on
the slopes. Fort. P. north of the new
and old batteries In the left center of
the line of defenses, was captured by
severe fighting on that night. . Â¦
These operations have driven an ef
fective wedge into the Russian center.
Severe explosions and extensive fires
have occurred in the fortress within the
last few days.
The total casualties of the Japanese
in the late attacks were 1100- The spirit
of the men is magnificent. The firing
of all the guns is wonderfully effective.
The climax to the late bombardment
came between 4 and 6 o'clock on Sun
day afternoon. It was a superb spec
tacle. Every . fort of the enemy was
engaged and the fighting in the
trenches was constant and severe. The
outposts of the contending forces were
only forty feet apart. \
At 1 o'clock this morning one of the
Japanese trenches collapsed into a
Russian gallery. The enemy, being
surprised underground, fled in con
fusion.

Special Diepatch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA, Nov. 7.â By an explo
sion of gas last night in the mines of
thp Great Eastern Quicksilver Mining
Company, located about four miles from
Guemeville. four men were injured, two
perhaps fatally. Should they recover
they will owe their lives not only to
medical skill, but to the heroism of one
of their number, Fred Sicotte, who,
though seriously injured and suffering
Intense pain, managed to tell to fellow
workmen the story of what had hap
pened and bring aid to the injured.
The four men, E. J. Leslie, Rollo
Heeten. Peter Vander Straten and Si
cotte, were sent into the mine to "blow
out" an accumulation of gas, which
was considered dangerous. While they
were at work the gas in some manner,
possibly through the striking of a
match, became ignited. Instantly the
men were enveloped in flames, from
which there was no escape.
Just how the accident happened the
men themselves do not seem to know.
All the sufferers can tell is that while
hard at work they were suddenly blind
ed by a fla-<=h. heard the thunder of an
explosion which' threw them to the
ground and found their clothing burned
from their backs and their skins
scorched and blistered. For a time
none of the four was able to move.
His appeal for aid was readily re
sponded to and the other three sufferers
were removed to the outer air, where
medical aid was given them.
Of the four Leslie and Hooten are the
most seriously injured. Leslie was not
only burned from head to foot, but also
had inhaled flames. His recovery is
considered impossible and his death is
expected at any time. The doctors say
Hooten may linger for several days, or
possibly twÂ£ weeks, but it will be im
possible for him to recover from the
shock attending the burns. The other
two men, while suffering excruciating
pain, are expected to recover.
Leslie and Hooten were taken to San
Francisco and are now at St. Luke's
Hospital, where everything possible is
being done for them. On the long Jour
ney over the rough mountain roads to
the railroad station and from there to
San Francisco by train they were ac
companied and attended by Dr. Byron
and Superintendent Abbey of the mines,
both of whom express sincere regret at
the accident.
but finally Fred Sicotte. although se
verely burned and suffering Intense
agony, volunteered to go for aid. With
hands, face, legs and arms scorched, he
painfully climbed 115 feet almost per
pendicularly to the 500-foot level and
summoned assistance.

Mietrasch's sympathy was aroused
and he opened his safe. He had noth
ing but $20 gold pieces, so he gave the
stranger three of them, telling him
that George might need the other ten.
Neither George nor the Chief's alleged
friend has been heard of since.
"Has George come yet?" he asked.
Mietrasch said no, . and. his curiosity
being aroused, he asked the stranger
if anything was wrong. The stranger
muttered that it was too bad and
finally said: "Well. I'm a personal
friend of the Chief of Police, who tells
me that George has been gambling and
lost $50. The Chief has given him to
midnight to make the loss good, other
wise George, poor fellow, will be ar

Schrieber, who is 75 years old, says
he had so much faith in the lawyer
that in March, 1902, they made an
agreement whereby Schrieber was to
sell his claims to Murphy for
$250,000 â $500 down and the
balance out of 25 per cent of
the proceeds of the mine. The plain
tiff says Murphy agreed to* raise
$25,000 to get the mine under opera
tion, but has been unable to interest
capital in the enterprise. He has not
paid the $500 and declined to give up
the bargain, says Schrieber.
A suit to annul an agreement for
the sale of mining property on the
peninsula of Lower California and to
recover the deed and patent to the
claims deposited in the Western Na

This gave the Chinese gamblers
about an hour and a half of grace and
they made good use of It. Sergeant
Ellis and his squad had received in
structions from Chief Wittman to en

and if need be break down the doors.
The squad started promptly on time,
but when they entered the resorts they
found that everything of a gambling
nature had disappeared except in one
place on ist. Louis, alley. There they
found gambling paraphernalia and the
five inmates of the room were ar
rested for violating the ordinance
which makes it a misdemeanor to ex
pose gambling paraphernalia to view
in a barricaded room. They were
promptly released on ball.
The injunction had been in force
since January 26 and all these months
the hands of the police were tied. It
was shown by the evidence of Kim

Roncovieri said the resolution recit
ing that it is "against. sound public
policy to submit the amendments at a
special election" was equivalent to the
Supervisors setting themselves up above
the State constitution, which makes
mandatory the submission of the prop
ositions in view of the fact that 20,009
electors had signed the petitions there
for.
"The argument â¢ that only a small
number of voters turned out at the
last special election is not a good one,"
said Roncovieri. "Give the voters a
chance to express their preference on
the proposals. The amendments will

Mrs. J. L. Buraslde and Miss E. Moors

action by the board.
Supervisor Braunhart argued that
the alleged evasion of the constitu

thought the Supervisors could use
their t judgment.
Supervisor Lunstedt thought the peo

Supervisor Brandensteln rose to a
defense of his colleagues. He said the
real issue was whether the control of
the schools should be taken from the

Bill was in the midst of his per
formance last Saturday evening when
the policeman â a new one on ' that
beat; "of courseâ shattered time-hon
ored usage by escorting him to prison
instead . of to his ; domicile. Judge
Mogan, however, dealt more consid
erately, with the maker of innocent
merriment ' for a neighborhood by dis
missing him with a reprimand.
Neighbors testified that Bill O'Brien
worked in a coalyard six days a week
and invariably celebrated the eve of
his rest day by getting drunk and
playing such pranks as to make him
a creator of much entertainment as
well as a source of considerable an
noyance to the vicinage of Eighth and
Brannan streets. Little boys espe
cially look forward with pleasurable
anticipation to Bill's Weekly inebriety,
and never fail to, derive much amuse
ment from his antics. "Here comes
Bill O'Brien," they gleefully shout
when he/hoves in sight each Satur
day evening, and as he tacks . un
steadily toward his home. 8 Kate
street, his comical bellowings and
grotesque cavortings keep them in
convulsions of laughter.
Peter Johnson beat his wife, was
arrested, save bail and failed to ap
pear when his case was called in De
partment 1. A policeman reported
that Mr. Johnson was. drunk when"
he provoked .arrest and had remained
in that condition until yesterday
morning, which led to the inference
that he had forgotten his engagement
in court Bail was forfeited and
bench warrant issued.
"That's right, Judge," was her in
dorsement of the officer's story. "This
town of yours is too gay for me. Af
ter the trouble I got Into, goodness
knows what has become of my hus
band. I suppose he's murdered or
something. But they'll find him a
tougher proposition than I ever knew
how to be. Why, he licked four po
licemen and three bartenders all in a
bunch just before we left Toledo.
When he's poked up there's things
doing, sure."
She received the Judge's order of
dismissal with less gratitude than
might have been expected. "It has
cost me two nights in jail and twen
ty dollars for a lawyer that was of no
earthly use," she said, "but thank you
just the same."
She was arrested for disorderly
conduct on Kearny street last Satur
day, and to the policeman she con
fided that she had started out with
her husband to see the town, but had
lost him somewhere, and was seeking
him when she was provoked to un
ladylike behavior by the jeers of some
persons who apparently regarded her
as a fit subject for coarse badinage.
Ella Myrtle Wilcox rrore a crimson
Tarn O'Shanter hat and a military
Jacket heavily freighted with gilt but
tons as she promised to return to
Toledo, Ohio, and remain there till
the close of her earthly career. .
"Just to think of it," she mur
mured, reflectively; "after living
twenty-seven years, nine of them mar
ried, and never being 'pinched' till I
struck 'Frisco. Goodness knows what
my friends in Toledo will think of me
when I tell them about It."
When a belated passer-by told her
that he whom she sought had depart
ed an hour previously on a street car
that was headed in a direction oppo
site to that in which she was to meet
him, faith fled, patience succumbed
and she was obsessed by the rage of
a woman scorned. The window
smashing ensued. Her arrest was fol
lowed by restoration of reason, and
she found that her love for P. J.
Murphy had turned to loathing. No,
indeed; she would never trouble him
again. She was glad. In fact, that
the man's character was revealed to
her ere she became indissolubly at
tached to him. He would never cost
her another thought â not even if she
were to meet him face to face. The
Judge could depend on her for that.
The Judge evidently did depend on
her, for he issued an order of dis
missal. ,
Miss Josie Murphy declared it was
P. J. Murphy's failure to keep tryst
that provoked her to smash a window
of his wetgoods emporium at Eighth
and Harrison streets last Saturday
night. "If he hadn't broken his
word," sÂ«he informed Police Judge
Mogan, "I wouldn't have broken his
glass."
Despite the similarity of their sur
names, the lady went on to explain,
there is no blood He between Mr. Mur
phy and herself. For some time prior
to her arrest they were sweethearts,
and she gauged his faithfulness by
her fealty, which was tenacity Itself*
It was this unquestioning trust of
her's that made his recreancy so bit
ter. He suggested that they fore
gather at a certain place after his
day's work was finished and he could
indulge in dalliance without sacrific
ing business. At the prescribed min
ute she was on the appointed spot.
He was not there, however, nor did
he appear after she had made more
than reasonable allowance for his
absence. Then she went to his store,
hoping to find he was detained there
by reluctance to refuse money. To
her horror, the place was in darkness
and the doors locked. Still declining
to believe he had willfully Jilted her,
she rapped the door panels until her
knuckles were as sore as her heart.
F. H. Huber, who manages a book
store on Kearny street, could not prove
that/ Edward Perry victimized him by
working the "change trick." and Judge
Cabaniss dismissed the case. The prose
cution tried to show that Mr. Perry's
failure to obtain some dollars to which
he was not entitled was entirely owing
to Mr. Huber's vigilance and obduracy.
James V. Miller (colored) also pro
nounced his arrest an Invasion of per
sonal rights. He^ad a loaded pistol in
his hand and was wandering in the
ferry station when a policeman over
hauled him. Asked what he meant by
displaying the deadly weapon, he said
he was seeking a Democrat.
"How about this charge. Mr. Miller?"
Judge Mogan inquired.
"Dis yah chawge am flxtlshlous," was
the answer, delivered with warmth.
"Ise no assasslnatah, sah, but a Pull
man pohtah, an' carry de gun fo' mah
pussunal proteckshun on de road."
"The policeman says you were drunk
and seeking the life-blood of a Demo
crat."
"Ah'll confess dat I hed sumfln ter

mus' kenterdick dat statement 'bout

Remanded for sentence to-day.

J. A. H. Umbach, accused with
George Farmer of robbing G. A: Glock
er at an early hour the other morning
in the latter's apartment, waxed indig
nant when the prosecution moved fora
postponement of the hearing. ;
"I desire to be tried right now," said
Mr. Umbach. Then, pointing a right
index finger at the complainant, he ex
claimed dramatically, "It is a shame
that a rascal like that should be al
lowed to injure a man's reputation by
having him brought into court."
Despite the protest the case was con
tinued till to-morrow, when it will be
trl^d in Department No. 1.

R. P. Hale of 411 Minna street ao
cused Miss 'Alllene Hill of having pur
loined from him one diamond ring and
presented it to a rival for her affection.
She is charged with grand larceny, and
the man^to whom she gave the ring is
also in prison, but the police do not
know what to do with him. as he did
not participate in* the actual theft of
the bauble, which, by the way, he Is
supposed to have hidden somewhere.
The case will be heard to-morrow by
Judge Mogan.
Noah Flood, who once served this
city and county as Assistant District
Attorney, was arrested for sleeping in
Union square at 7 o'clock- yesterday
morning. He pleaded that he went into
the park in order to obtain an unob
structed view of the sunrise and while
seated upon a bench awaiting the day
orb's appearance he dropped into slum
ber. Patrolman J. Maloney, however,
testified that the extinguished jurist
was drunk. Judge Mogan dismissed
the case with a reprimand to the de
fendant.
For cruelly beating John Oleson's
horse Mrs. Laura Becker will be sen
tenced to-day by Judge Fritz. Mr. Ole
son testified that the woman hammered
the animal's head with a heavy rake,
inflicting several deep cuts. The de
fense claimed that the horse not only
trespassed on Mrs. Becker's property,
but also chased her little daughter. The
court thought that the attack was not
warranted by the alleged provocation.

Her Love Has Changed to Scorn
Deputy Registrar Zemansky explained
to the committee that J. G. Ramsey had
been appointed caretaker of the voting
machines, which he had put in condi
tion for election day, pending the certi
fication of a civil service eligible for the
position.
The committee postponed action on
the proposed ordinance regulating side
walk elevators, and directed the in
spector thereof not to enforce the exist
ing ordinance.
The committee decided to investigate
the status of the claim of the city
against ex-Treasurer Widber, who mis
appropriated $116,000. On Monday morn
ing the Investigation begins.
The committee began an inquiry into
the question of whether or not the
State or the city has the right to assess
the San Mateo road, but desisted when
Informed by City Attorney Long that
the matter would come up in court on
November 14 next. The attorney for the
road said he did not know whether the
taxes would be paid under protest.
The Geary Street Railway Company
paid $736 46 into the city treasury, be
ing 6 per cent of its gross receipts for
October.
Michael Casey, John E. McDougald
and J. Copus urged that the dome of
the City Hall be lighted for five nights
during the convention of the American
Federation of Labor, to be held in this
city beginning November 14 next, and
the committee acquiesced. The flag
poles will be erected on Market street
from Second to Sixth and decorated for
the occasion.
Tax Collector Edward J. Smith ap
peared before the Finance Committee
and urged the printing of a form of
protest against the payment of the tax
levied for the redemption of and inter
est on the new bond issue. Smith stated
that the legality of the tax was before
the courts, and he thought the small
taxpayer should be afforded every
facility to file formal written protest
against the tax in order that it might
be returned in the event that the tax
is declared illegal. The committee or
dered that the forms be printed. As
sessor Dodge will also furnish the legal
form of protest.
â¢ The question of accommodations fur
nished by the company to the public
the Finance Committee decided was
within the province of the Street Com
mittee, and the matter of sanitation
was referred to the Health Committee.
At this point Chairman Connor of the
Street Committee agreed to take up all
phases of the inquiry, and It was so
ordered.
The committee agreed to this line of
inquiry, but refused to go into thre sys
tem of accounting used by the com
pany. . .
"The company should also answer as
to what, If any, franchises they claim
to hold under which they are not op
erating cars," said Troy. "Then it
should be compelled to tell whether it
claims any franchises on Post street
from Taylor to Kearny, ;on Stockton
and Bush streets and on Grant avenue,
and also as to the number of cars op
erated."
"The point has been legitimately
raised as to whether the United Rail
j-oads has forfeited any of its fran
chises by reason of nonuse," said Bran
(Jensteln. "The right to use curves at
Post and Kearny streets and at Fulton
street and Eighth avenue are subjects
of legitimate inquiry, and the company
should make reply on all of these
points."
The Supervisors' Finance Committee
yesterday arranged for the holding of
an inquiry by the Street Committee into
the operations of the United Railroads
relative to Its franchises and the char
acter of its service, upon which E. P. E.
Troy has propounded a long list of
questions to which he wants the cor
poration to reply. Troy wanted the in
quiry to take In the alleged overcapi
talization of the company's properties.
Supervisor d'Ancona said the question
of fares and finances would be a sub
ject that would take a long time to look
into, whether it would be justified or
not.

LOS i ANGELES, Nov. 7.â Rev. E. E.
Plannette, whose arrest here one
Sunday night a year ago, after his
church service, y for stealing potted
plants, and subsequent commitment to
the Southern California State Hospital
for the Insane at Patton resulted in a
tragedy and sensation, has again come
before the public. He was released
from. the institution as cured; but has
now been committed to an asylum at
Marshall, Iowa. He had preached twice
there and his strange pulpit manners
led to comment, which made him vio
lent.
At Patton Plannette's wife alleged he
received cruel treatment. at the hands
of Dr. Doland and this brought about
the recent investigation which led to

in the accounts of J. F. Danforth, local
disbursing officer of the United States
Geological Survey, who has been miss
ing from his home in this city for sev
eral days, and for whom the Federal
officers are supposed to be searching.
Danforth's known shortage up to the
present time aggregates $1672, most of
which amount was secure(T*on a check
signed by himself and drawn on the
United States Sub-Treasury at New
York, Three other checks are missing
from the order-book, and these could
have been filled out and signed by Dan
forth for any amount he chose. The
Sub-Treasury has been notified of the
numbers of the checks. and they will
be refused payment when presented.
So far no trace of them has been found.
Danforth is secured in the Aetna In
demnity Company in the sum of $25,000,
and the officer in charge of the local
office of the survey expressed confi
dence that the amount would more
than cover any shortage that could
possibly develop.
Danforth, who was a young man and
unmarried, had been in the civil serv
ice for several years, and was fully
trusted. Nothing has been iearned of
his whereabouts since the ( day of his
disappearance. â¢'

ordered the City Attorney to draft an
ordinance to prohibit the bringing of
outside waste and filth into the muni
cipality.
Fritz Boehmer appeared on behalf
of the scavengers and asserted that the
garbage was being utilized , to improve
the Bay Farm Island without cost,
and that -the material dumped along
the highway was not unsanitary. Trus
tee W. M. Bowers. replied to Boehmer
that It was not a question of cheap
road construction, but a matter that
concerned the general health of the
community. He alleged that the
former dumps on Webster street had
been the cause of several cases of ty
phoid fever. Bowers moved and Trus
tee B. E. Combs seconded the motion
instructing the City Attorney to pre
pare a prohibitive ordinance against
the carting of outside garbage into the

OAKLAND, Nov. 7. â To have a

of age, and yet not know it, was the
fate of Deputy Sheriff White to-day
while out hunting for Arthur Fred
erick, who succeeded in spreading
the bars of the County Jail here Sat
urday night and getting away.
White's chagrin was increased by the
fact that the family dog tore a new
pair of trousers.
White picked up a lad in his
search whom he asked to take him to
the Frederick home. The b'oy hap
pened to be the one he was looking
for, but he gave a false name, and
then when the Sheriff went into the
house he ran through the yard' and
over the back fence. The mother
pointed to the disappearing form of
her young hopeful in answer to
White's query and the deputy went
in pursuit. The bulldog in the back
yard then took & hand in the matter.
White came out second best and lost
all trail of his quarry. <Â¦> ;

Attorney A. V. Mendenliall Addresses
Kntlihsiastic Audience.
ThÂ« Democratic party consists of three sep
arate wings; the Northwestern radical Demo
crats; the South, and the Northeastern Demo
crates represented by Tammany. The party
at present consists only of the Northeastern
and Southern elements, which were joined by
Hill, an adroit politician and a crafty and
dangerous man. -Theoretically the Democrats
have a strong case, but Parker made two se
rious mistakes when he eald that the trusts
should be treated under the common law, and
that the tariff could not be changed, even if
he were elected. The charge of Imperialism
eeeme to be their strong point. Their last
charge is one against Cortelyou of dishonest
pressure on the corporations. Roosevelt has
denied this, and his word is as good as Â»4d.
I have met Mr. Parker, and he is a mar. of
m&rnetlo personality and a clean, old-fanh
loned Democrat, but not a fighter and not a
man of deep convictions.
Our two great partiei have really become
parts of the constitution, though they are not
written down as such, and It Is only through
their agency that all parts of the government
can run smoothly. Every patriotic citizen
Bhould affiliate with one or the other. While
we should not blindly follow a party In local
elections. In national elections It should be
the party, the doctrine, and not the man, for
Which we should vote,. . .
The Republtpan party ,haÂ«. not, been very
strong in theory. If has often tended to rep
resent the well-to-do class. But it has al
ways been able to do things and do them
right. â¢ .
It Is generally thought extremely dangerous
to talk about either religion or politics In a
Bute university. But I think that a Kudy
of practical politics Is entirely in place In a
university if we put aside prejudice and par
tisan passion. If our college men are not
trained to take part In government what ben
efit has the State derived by educating them?
Our institutions are based on the presumption
that patriotism exists, and they will work
properly only when there is patriotism to guide
them.
In hlÂ» weekly lecture before the Col
lege of Commerce Btudents to-day
President Benjamin Ide Wheeler made
a good campaign epeech on the sub
ject of to-morrow's election. He told
what should be an educated man's
duty. He urged all the students who
were of age to vote and those who
were not to take an interest in poli
tics as soon as they should be of age.
He Eaid parties were both necessary
and valuable in carrying on the Gov
ernment and that every man should
affiliate himself with one or the other.
President Wheeler then gave his
personal estimate of each party, saying
first that he did not feel himself free
to be allied with any. He character
ized the Republican party as a party
without many theories of government,
but at present the greatest party the
country ever had in getting things
done and in getting them done right.
The Democratic party, President
Wheeler thought, was too broken up
and divided within itself to have any
definite policy and simply represented
the opposition to the Republicans. The
Socialist party, he said, should not be
condemned by an educated man with
out a hearing; the Prohibitionist he
did not deem national, and he did not
regard the Populist as of any value
whatever.
President Wheeler said in part:

Dr. Collinge is endeavoring to locate
relatives of Mrs. Eitten in Los Angeles
and expects to hear from them to-mor
row.
Coroner H. B. Mehrmann has set the
inquest in both cases for "Wednesday
evening at 7 o'clock. The crew of the
train which ran down the women will
be summoned to give evidence, as will
also Dr. Collinge, his son and daughter,
who narrowly escaped meeting the fate
that befell the two women. Dr. Col
linge is at a loss to explain why Mrs.
Matheson and Mrs. Eitten did not hear
the train rushing upon them from be
hind. The women were walking close
to the track and engaged in conversa
tion when the bumper of the locomo
tive struck them, hurling them both
from ' the track and fracturing their
skulls. Percy Collinge, a son of Dr.
Collinge, was close to the women when
the locomotive struck them, and it was
the impact of their bodies that knocked
him to the macadam, causing him to
sustain a fracture of the nose and a
sprained ankle.
Deputy Coroner James Fowler and
Dr. J. A. Colllnge, the latter of whom
was with the women when they met
death, got into communication to-day

Election and Speaks From
Unprejudiced Standpoint
Crew of Train That Killed

B. Eitten Will Be on Stand
OAKLAND, Nov. 7.â The campaign
has closed here and Alameda County,
which has gjven to the country a Cabi
net officer, a Governor of this State, a
United States Senator, a Congressman
and many other able servants of the
people, is preparing to give the largest
vote for Theodore Roosevelt and the
Republican ticket that It has ever
polled in a long and honorable history.
The voters of Alameda County have
not a great deal to vote for this year.
Outside of the ten Presidential electors
there are only a few district officers
to be chosen â three \ State Senators,
seven Assemblymen, three Supervisors
and one Congressman. . So few officers
are there to vote for that in some
districts there is only a Congressman
and an Assemblyman to ballot for,
aside from the electors.
The night before the battle Is always
one for predictions, and a conservative
estimate of the situation assures that
Alameda County will elect every one of
the Republican nominees, and give an
unprecedented majority for the Repub
lican electors. The Democrats have
made no fight at all for the^ leaders
of their ticket, and the only contests
that have made their appearance on
the political horizon are purely per
sonal ones and involve salaried offices.
An effort has been made to displace
all the three Republican nominees I for
Supervisor, but even this is not a party
fight, for in two cases the Democrats
have indorsed disgruntled Republi
cans. Even the Democratic County
Central Committee, as already reported
in The Call, has been compelled to
come out over the signature of its of
ficers and denounce one of its party
nominees for withdrawing from the
fight at the last moment in the inter
ests of a disgruntled Republican.
In spite of all of this kind of work
the three Republican nominees will be
electedâ C. F. Homer in the First Dis
trict, H. D. Rowe in the Fourth Dis
trict and John Mitchell in the Fifth
District.
There is not even a shadow of a
contest in the matter of the three Re
publican nominees for State Senator,
and the following candidates will carry
their respective districts: J. G. Mattos
Jr., Thirteenth District; Captain W. M.
Simpson, Fourteenth District; G. R.
Lukens, Fifteenth District. Captain
Simpson will succeed J. R. Knowland,
who will be elected to Congress to sue-
Clarence Crowell, chairman of the
Republican County Central Committee,
has issued a statement in which he
calls upon every Republican to vote
to-morrow. He urges them all to save
any confusion and difficulty by stamp
ins a cross at the head of theaicket
and voting for everybody who has the
indorsement of the Republican party.
Just a shadow of a fight has de
veloped In one Assembly district.
County Assessor Henry P. Dalton has
turned loose upon Assemblyman Phil
M. Walsh. Dalton, who lives in the
Forty-eighth Assembly District, now
represented by "Walsh, to-day flooded
the town with personal letters asking
his friends to vote for W. S. O'Brien,
the Union Labor nominee. Dalton is
possessed of great influence in his dis
trict, but it Is not believed that he will
be able to defeat Mr. Walsh. Dalton
charges Walsh with attacking Gover
nor Pardee at the last session of the
Legislature. Walsh to-night issued a
reply in which he shows that he was
a consistent supporter of the adminis
tration, and supported every bill the
administration favored.
ceed Secretary Victor H. Metcalf. Mr.
Mattos represents the newly created
district. Senator Lukens will succeed
himself. Senator Leavitt is a hold
over and has two years more to serve.
Faculty regulation No. 17 provides
that all accused students shall be al
lowed a hearing before final action is
taken In their cases, and in accordance
with this regulation the letters to the
seniors have been written. .
A committee from the graduating
cla.es, led by Gustav "White and Joseph
L<oeb, prominent seniors, attempted to
reason the matter with Captain Nance
to-day. They found the captain cour
teous, but like granite. He refused to
discuss the case, informing the men
that it was all official business and not
of the sort that could be properly made
the subject of oral discussion.
"If the class has any statements to
make," said Captain Nance, "let them
be In writing and placed on file with
the other papers in the case."
Just how many seniors have received
President Wheeler's letter is not known.
7t Is believed that more than half of
the class is affected by the order.
President Wheeler said this morning
that the letters that have been sent out
are merely routine affairs. He regrets
that the students were ignorant of the
faot that in rebelling last Wednesday
against Captain Nance's order they
were dealing with a War Department
order. This he deems unfortunate, as
there can be no yielding-.
Captain Nance declines to discuss the
affair In any way. He has the regula
tions of the War Department at his
back, which he followed in issuing his
order, requiring students to march into
his class room in military style and In
perfect order. Secure in the fact that
he is well within the army regulations.
Captain Nance remains cool, apparent
ly fancying that it is his place now
merely to "stand pat" and permit
others to worry.
IN A MILITARY VISE.
It is explained that If a man Is drop
ped from Military JA It will be Impossi
ble for him to procure a diploma. . That
Is what distresses the seniors and that
is why the entrance to Captain Nance's
office to-day was darkened by the
forms of various upper class men
bearing typewritten explanations of
their conduct on last Wednesday.
lutdy unlmpaseloned, preserves an un
ruffled front,, while seniors are busy
hastening to his office with the written
statements required of them by Presi
dent "Wheeler.
The men breathed easier when Presi
dent Wbaeler was quoted In that fash
ion, fancying that all was to be serene
and that no unpleasant sequel would
attend the big riot of the day before.
That they counted without their host
is evident from the following missive,
signed by President Wheeler, which
seniors found in their mail this morn-
Ing:

"1 thought I would write you what
Pyramid Pile Cure has done for me. I
had a most aggravated case of bleed-
Ing piles; indeed I dreaded when I had
to go to stool. One 50-cent box cured
me. I feel . like a new man. I . have
recommended it to others as being the
most wonderful remedy known. It is
indeed a great blessing to suffering
humanity. You are at liberty to use
this for all It Is worth, and I hope It
may do good.'.' Rev. W. E. Carr, 356
North Holbrook street, Danville,' Va,
Clergymen (like all professional men
who lead sedentary lives) â¢ are espe-
cially addicted to piles. In various
forms, and are continually on the look-
out for a remedy which will give re-
lief, with" little or no idea of obtaining
a cure.
Recognizing this fact. Rev. Mr. Can-
consents to the use of>hls - name in or-
der that other BUfferers may know
there Is a cure called Pyramid Pile
Cure, which is sold by druggrists every-
where for the low price of 50 cents
a package, and which will bring about
foi every one afflicted with piles the
same beneficial results as in his own
case. Be careful to accept no substi-
tutes and remember that there is no
remedy "Just as good."
A little book describing the causes
and cure of piles is published by Pyra-
mid Drug Company, Marshall, Mich.,
and will be sent free for the asking.
All sufferers are advised to write for
it, as It contains valuable information

WHY?
Because It Is
the best!The farcical play entitled "Prince
Karl," written for Richard Mansfield
by Archibald Clavering Gunter, opened
to a crowded house at the Alcazar
Theater last night. The piece is full
of amusing situations and the risible
faculties of the audience were kept In
play from the rise to the .fall of the
curtain. John Craig in the title Â¦ role
was artistic and made the most out of
the part of the impulsive and love

Madeleine Lucette Ryley's sparkling
comedy, "An American Citizen," with
which the Majestic Stock Company
opened the week last night, furnished
sufficient â¢ merriment for - a large au

the best points of the play could not
fail to be brought out Being the first
night, long waits between the acts
were unavoidable and thÂ» curtain did
not fall upon the reunited husband
and wife until 11:20, but the spec
tators, in the presence of such acting,
felt that they had not waited in^vain.
The leading characters, . Beresford

The Central Theater put on "Her
Marriage Vow" last evening, and it
was received in, such fashion, with
frequent cheers and continued de
mands for the leading people at the
end of each act, that it is a certain
winner. Myrtle Vane, formerly at the
Central, was welcomed back with
enough flowers to start a wholesale
florist In business. Herschel Mayall
and Ethel Clifton" were at their best.
Benny Halifax, Henry Shume and
Edna Ellsmere scored. The scenic
effects were all they were advertised
to be, and a little more. In the third
act two trains rush across the stage
at express speed, the locomotives
throwing out sparks in abundance.
Coupled with the exciting Incidents
that immediately precede this rail
way realism, the scene brought out a
boot heel and vocal fusillade that
jarrod the building. There are thrills
enough in "Her Marriage Vow" to
outfit half a dozen melodramas and
not make the excitement scanty in
any of the lot. At one place the
heroine Is bound and placed on the
railroad track by the villain. At the

WASHINGTON. Nov. 7.â Enckes
comet was seen at the United States
naval observatory Sunday night and
again to-night with the twelve-inch
telescope. Its radiance, however. Is so *
feeble that aa yet the comet Is barely
visible. It appears through the tel
escope as a patch ol light and several
days perhaps will elapse before ac
curate observations can be made of its
position which, however, follows clearly
the path predicted for the return of the
comet.

courier his enforced restraint and scorn
of doing the work of a flunky were
admirably portrayed.
Miss Lillian Lawrence was charming
as the dashing young widow, Mrs.
Florence Arhmien Lowell. Miss Adele
Belgarde as her mother-in-law, Mrs.
Daphne Dabney Lowell, also in love
with the prince, gave a finished repre
sentation of the part and helped
greatly in keeping the fun going- Miss
Elizabeth Woodson was chic and clever
as -Alicia Euclid Lowell, a product of
Vassar College. George Osbourne had
a congenial role as Markey Davis, the
deaf hotel-keeper. Harry HUIiard,
Luke Conness and John B. Maher were
excellently suited to their parts. The
piece is well staged.
CENTRAL THEATER'S NEW LEAD
1 ING LADY. NOW PLAYING IN
"THE MARRIAGE VOW."
The women are Just as good as the
men. Most charming is Florence
Smythe as Lucy Rigby, the heroine;
Grace Romine excellent as Mrs. Rigby
and Florida Klngsley deserves a half
column or so for her stunning bit aa
the orphan girl "Chic" Elzey. The
whole production, in fact, suggests

the best to be had, and you can, on no
count, afford to miss "The County
Chairman." ,' . â¢ â¢
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
He tells his man: "You can't stick
to boxing gloves when your opponent's
fighting with a meat ax."
Again: "The last week of a cam
paign's no time for bird shot. You've
got to get out the artillery."
And so on, the comedy bristles with
dialectic wit and sense. Greatly the
Hackler part gains by being in the
capable hands of Theodore Roberts,
who is simply "presented" with the
rest of the company by Mr. Savage.
But Mr. Roberts needs no large type
here. His work, from the time when he
was of the old Frawley company â
stranded, now, alack! in South Africa
â has been favored of his San Fran
cisco brethren. Well with the best of
it stands his portrait of the shrewd,
kindly country politician. He gives
most ably the genial goodness of the
man. his capable scampishness in poli
tics, and when Hackler tells the man
he has been hounding for twenty years
tho reason for his pursuit Mr. Roberts
rises to a high level of power. All
of those with him of their kind are
equally convincing.
George Thatcher â once of the fa
mous Thatcher. West and Primrose
Minstrels â does a lazy negro, who
"doesn't know what's the use of be-
Ingr free If you has to work hard all
the time," in rare fashion. William
Lamp, once the "beauty man" at the
Alcazar, returns as a full-fledged
leading man of ample conviction, giv
ing a virile and sympathetic study of
Tilford Wheeler, the candidate. Jef
ferson Briscoe, the store-box ora
tor, is capitally assumed by , James
Bradbury, his shrewish lady as clev
erly by Florence Gerald.
He describes the nomination meet
ing: "We agreed upon a harmony pro
grammeâand then started in to fight."
The politics must be quite persuasive.
The campaigners who had turned in
last night laughed, grunted and sym
pathized in every possible key. Jim
Hackler, the "county chairman." said
most of the things that amused them.
They amused every one. Why
shouldn't they? Jim â he's "Jim" to
every one â says to his man, who ob
jects to his method of electioneering,
"What have you to do with it? You're
only the candidate. Your place is to
lay low and follow Instructions."
Not at all new is the human' or other
furniture of the piece â there's a pump,
a general merchandise store, the fresh
drummer that whistles himself in from
New York, the train the town turns out
to meet, the lazy stump-speaker with
the shrewish wife, the village miser and
all the other first aids to the tooral
rural drama. But these Mr. Ade has
vitalized and strung together into most
persuasive story, punctured with much
laughter and a tear or two. of which
none need feel ashamed.
That is not usually the person-who
has-seen-it-in-New York's story. It
will be found true, however, of mosfof
the productions Henry Savage sends
out here; and it is Mr. Savage who in
troduced '"The County Chairman" to us
last night. Better cast one could hard
ly picture for the piece, nor â for the
moment â better piece for the cast.
It is the first George Ade effort to
be seen here â and the best possible
drummer for the next. The "com
edy-drama" is the first of anything
outside of the musical comedy genre
with which the humorist first burst
upon the theatrical public, and there
fore more lately representative of a
singularly interesting figure in Â¦ the
American drama. Nor was it only
George Ade's and Mr. Savage's "fu
neral" â as Jim Hackler says â last
night. The performance was given in
aid of the Girls' Club, and there was
not a single uncitizened seat in the
house to shame the fair lapses that
held you up for 25-cent programmes.
It was worth every cent of it!
Inevitably Mr. Ade will be compared
with Charles Hoyt. He refuses, I be
lieve*, the mantle of the dead humorist,
with which some have invested him.
But he has the same keen eye for a
type, the same lively sense of the ridic
ulous, the same shrewd nose for the
current absurdity. Yet it Is a humor
more genial, more human, deeper
planted. Horseplay is a little in evi
dence â it is less horse, more play â the
fun springing naturally from the clash
of his characters. Politics, county poli
tics, the playwright has made his
theme, the 'art interestâ as Teddy Webb
says â deftly interwoven therewith.
The "man behind" was In large evi
dence last night. He had seen 'The
County Chairman" in New York. Liked
it. Hoped fearfully that the company
that brought It to the Columbia was as
good as the one he saw, still playing in
the East. Thought it was, as the even
ing went on. In fact, modestly crow
ing â evidently as the recommender of
the comedyâ he thought the company
might be even a little better than the
other.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 7.â The Su
preme Court to-day affirmed the deci
sion of the Surreme Court of the State
of Wisconsin in the newspaper boycott
case arising from the alleged business
combination of the Sentinel, News and
Evening Wisconsin, all published in
Milwaukee, asair.st the Journal of that
city, affecting advertising rates. The
Â©pinion upheld the validity of the Wis
consin anti-trust law so fax as it ap
plies to this case.
The case came before the Supreme
Court on writs of error to set aside con
victions and sentence* of A. J. Aikens,
Albert Huegin and M. H. Hoyt, pub
lishers of the three' newspapers in the
combination. The ground of the writs
was that the croceedings violated the
rights cf the plaintiffs in error under
the fourteenth amendment to the con
stitution cf the United States. The in
formations were brought under the
Wisconsin statutes, which impose irn
rrisonnient or fine on any two or more
persons who shall combine for the pur
rose of willingly or maliciously injur
ing ar.cther in his reputation, trade,
business or profession by any means
whatever. The plaintiffs in error were
severally charged with unlawfully com
bining together with the intention of
willfully and maliciously injuring the
Journal company by agreeing as fol
lows:
"If arj- r>erscn should agree to pay
the increased advertising rates charged
by the Journal company then he should
not be permitted to advertise In any of
the ether three newspapers except at a
corresponding increase of rates, but if
he should refuse to pay the Journal
corr.pany the increased rate then he
should be allowed to advertise in any
of the other three papers at the rate
previously charged."
It was alleged that this conspiracy
â¢was carried out and that much damage
to the business of the Journal company
ens-aed.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 7. â Chief Jus
tice Fuller of the United States Su
preme Court to-day announced that
the court has refused a writ of cer
tiorari in the case of the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company vs. Sarah Guyon.
The case involved the question of
damages on account of the wreck of
the passenger steamship City of Rio
de Janeiro, which sank off the Golden
Gate at San Francisco in 1901, carry
ing down 120 persons, including Con
sul 'General Wildman.
The case was a test one. and it
was charged that although twenty
minutes' time elapsed after the signal
to lower the boats before the catas
trophe occurred, only one boat was
floated. This, the steamship company
claimed, was due to the fact that
many members of the crew were Chi
nese and could 'not understand the
orders given them, but the court re
fused to limit liability on this ac
count.
The purpose of the petition for a
writ of certiorari was to bring the
case to the Supreme Court for re
view, and the denial has the effect of
making final the decision of the Cir
cuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuif, which was favorable to the
passengers.
The previous affair referred to above
was organized on the occasion of the
requiem in the Kazan Cathedral on the
anniversary of the death of Alexander
III, the students making a demonstra
tion in memory of the death in the
Peter and Paul fortress of one of their
number, named Borski. On this occa
sion Fulton, the prefect of police, or
dered the police home and personally
spoke to the students, asking them to
desist and disperse, which they did.
These two incidents, small in them
selves, have created much talk in St.
Petersburg owing to the methods of
dealing with student disturbances,
which is attributed to the initiative of
Prince Sviatopolk-Mlrsky, Minister of
the Interior. The demonstrations were
neither more nor less serious than
many which in recent years were put
down by charging Cossacks with low
ered lances. Much pleasure is also ex
pressed with the -announcement of the
resumption of Prince Sviatopolk-Mir
sky's public receptions.
ST. PETERSBURG. Nov. 7.â There
was a small student riot at the univer
sity to-day, but It was handled in the
same rational manner as was the one
at the Kazan Theater about ten days
ago, and as a result the whole affair
passed off without serious consequences.
About a thousand university students
divided into two groups, one sing
ing the Russian national anthem and
the other the â¢'Marseillaise." The police
appealed to the latter group to stop,
and they agreed to do so if their op
ponents stopped. This was done, and
the affair ended with a hearty laugh
all around.

COCKROACHES â Subscriber, City.
Borax is said to be one of the best of
cockroach exterminators. There Is
something peculiar either in the smell
or touch of .borax which is certain
death to the pests. They will flee from
it and will never again appear whare
it has been placed. It has also the
great advantage of. being perfectly
harmless to human beings; hence there
is no danger from poisoning. The bo
rax, pulverized, should be Â¦ sprinkled
around the infested places. It Is said

given to this question, explaining like

negroes black. . Originally every . one

it had become brown. As for. the

It Is related that a certain family,
the Browns, had given an .Impertinent
maid notice and in consequence were
obliged to assume the duties that she
pointedly neglected. On the last day
of Katy's stay, as one of the women
of the family was hastening to answer
a ring at the front door, she was ar
rested by an explosive whisper from
the rear of the hall, where the Ir

follows relative to the gender of ship:
Inanimate objects are often represent

remarkable for power, greatness or
sublimity are spoken of as masculine â
as the sun, time, death, etc. Things
amiable, or prolific, are spoken of as
feminine â as the moon, the earth, etc.
Figuratively, gender is indicated only
by the personal pronouns of the singu

THE MARRIAGE OF COLLEGE GIRLS.
MISS ABBOTT hasi compiled statistics which show that but
few of the graduates of Vassar marry, and that perpetuation
of Vassar traditions in the second generation is imperiled by
the fact that in the families of such as do'marry the children average
only one and one-half.
Perhaps those who assume that a college education indisposes
women to domestic duties and' makes them averse to marriage
po too far. In spite of all the instructions of prudence and pawkish
ness, romance is the leading element in marriage. But' romance,
with its rainbow and bloom, its enthusiasm and optimism, its dis
regard of butter and of bread, has its period of adolescence and
decline. If the years of romance be passed by women in the se
clusion of college life, and its knock at the door of the heart be un
heard in the ambitions and scholastic interests of the classroom, the
rainbow vision seldom comes again.
The Prince on a white horse is not seen by the eye of fancy, and
man is looked upon in his natural shape as a rather uninteresting
animal, who feeds like an ox, and smokes and chews, sometimes
drinks, and seems to hs.vc his pleasures in .wading to his girthy mid
dle in trout streams, or in gunning for game. All things have their
time, and if the time of romance be spent in the workaday occupa
tions of college, in learning the relations of the hypotenuse to the
other sides of a triangle and in gazing through a telescope at the
twinkling stars and steadfast planets, the incentive to marriage has
no existence, and the bachelor maid, panoplied by her parchment,
Â£oes forth not fancy free even, for she has no fancy. She is a mat
ter-of-fact person, not subject to illusions.
But what of man! Poor, devil, youmay tie him to a whirling
wheel, immerse him in business, or boil him in oil, and you cannot
kill romance in him. It disturbs his dreams before he is twenty
and it flashes like the aurora borealis in his winter skies when he
is eighty. In his case neither age nor occupation can safeguard him
against it. If he isn't watched and tended he will; run. off -and get
married when he' has lost all his teeth and all his hair. A college
education does not" cure him. No education at all does not impair
the iridescent vision. Jack will idealize Jill, and Darby will invest
Joan with sweet and angelic attributes, world without end.
If all the ladies choose to indurate the romantic spot in their
hearts by going to college man will lose his interest in life and pine
and die. Then what will Vassar do?

FEW LEAVES FROM
FASHION'S NOTEBOOK
QUALITIES OF THE
GOOD HOUSEKEEPER
The choice of Mr. Kahn and Mr. Hayes was a wise choice, for
â¢they are fitted to the aspirations of the city and State. The cam
paign against them has been revolting and repulsive to a degree.
It has been characterized by calumny and falsehood and by appeals
to passion and prejudice, that are unbecoming in the politics of a
tree people. Let men soberly reflect that a result secured by such
appeals is always disastrous. The everlasting equities force a moral
balance, in which error is punished, and that punishment in politics
cuts the innocent down with the guilty.
San FYancisco has a great duty on hand to-day. This city by re
electing Judges Murasky, Seawell, Troutt and Kerrigan can compel
a most necessary reform in the whole State, in the election of our
judiciary. Such opportunities are infrequent and the present one
should be improved. San Francisco can give the seawall proposition
such a majority that the ill-starred opposition that has developed in
Southern California cannot overcome it. San Francisco can widen
her commercial horizon and make the most of her matchless seaport
facilities by giving the exemption of American shipping from local
lax a majority that will carry it against all opposition. It is unbe
coming in a great seaport and maritime State like this to put a
penalty on the American flag, to degrade it below the untaxed flags
that fly over foreign ships. This is an issue in which pride, patriot
ism and interest all unite, and San Francisco should vote to remove
the ban from the Stars and Stripes.
The election of two working Congressmen, the building of the
seawall, the reform in choosing Judges and the exemption of Amer
ican shipping from taxes that foreign shipping does not pay afce the
matters of keenest local concern in to-day's election. They appeal
to the intelligence, the prudence and the sentiment of self-preserva
tion of the people of this city. This is a metropolis ; let it be met
ropolitan in doing what is demanded by its dignity, its welfare and
its progress.
The Call has uttered its conscience in these matters throughout
the campaign, and its voice has been for the guidance of all citizens,
irrespective of party. Others may differ from # us in their view of
local policy, but none can dispute the sincerity of motive with which
we have desired to do the best for the future of San Francisco and
California. . â¢ . â¢"
%elopment
T^HE national campaign has been the- most peculiar that the
country has had since the second election of Mr. Monroe, which
is caHed the Golden Age of American politics. The party con
ventions this year roused but little interest. The common sense of
the country- seems to have concluded, at the beginning, that there was
nothing in the condition of the country that required a change, and
that a change was therefore to be avoided by the re-election of a
Republican administration, which has glorified itself by con
spicuously beneficial achievement.
So plain was it that this was the will and purpose^)/ the country
that men who had determined what their duty is went about their,
business, waiting with patience for election day to record their ex
pression. This feeling was shared by the independent vote, that
large body of citizens who consider it a solemn and patriotic duty
to vote at Presidential elections, even though they leave local poli
tics to take care of itself in the intermediate years. These conditions
have resulted in a conspicuously unexcited campaign. There have
been no marching processions, no impassioned gatherings, no fiery
discussions on the streets between individuals, no straw votes on
the railway trains.
The last week was enlivened by Judge Parker's reiteration of a
slander involving the President and Mr. Cortelyou ; by the Presi
dent's vigorous and manly' reply, which was conclusive of the issue,
and by Mr. Cleveland's interview, in the manliest way indorsing
Mr. Cortelyou *s honor and honesty and career, though singularly
lamenting that he had taken the chairmanship of the National Com
mittee, as if honest men, as he declares Cortelyou to be, were not
wanic-d at 1hc head of party committees. These closing incidents
have only increased the volume and momentum of the movement
toward President Roosevelt, so that his supporters can say With con
fidence, on ;his morning of the day of battle and of ballots, that
the country is with him. , }
Hen- in San Francisco we owe certain duties to our city and
ourselves v.hich we cannot snub nor avoid. This city, not any party,
but the city, owes it to itself to secure two working members of the
next House of Representatives, in place of the two non-working Rep
resentatives who were elected in a reactionary spasm two years ago.
It will be amazing if this city do not back up the majority it will
give President Roosevelt by sending Kahn and Hayes to support
the President in the House, and do something for San Francisco.
We cannot believe that our people will falter in this duty, because
the natter totiches the vitals of our business and goes to the inter
ests of every citizen. We have presented it throughout the cam
paign as something that goes beyond party politics, and concerns
bur position among the cities of the country, our place in commerce
and our step with the great procession of American progress and de-

The Southern Pacific Company was
advised yesterday from Chicago that
the Transcontinental Passenger Asso
ciation' has fixed the period for the
sale of colonist rates during the year
1905 from March l'to May 15 and
from September 15 to October 31.
According to the data now being gath
ered by the passenger department of
the Southern /Pacific Company the
colonist traffic- of the present year haa
been the heaviest during any period
of the business. Although complete
returns from Eastern points have not
yet been received by the company, the
figures already gathered show that the
sale of westbound colonist tickets dur
ing the thirty days ending October 15
averaged 800 a day. , -;. Â¦.,â¢,â¢;Â¦'
Colonist Traffic 1 - Very Heavy.

The time allowed for the keeping
unburied of the unidentified dead in
the case of the body of the young man
found on the ocean beach last Thurs
day expired last night. Mrs. Bertha
Conness of 618 Post street, who had
given an order to Undertaker Metzler
for the, burial was engaged in gather
ing the fees necessary for \that pur
pose. She invested about $15 in flow
ers, the latest contribution by her be
ing a beautiful floral. pillow.
She said yesterday that the name of
the dead man was McGinn; that he
was a race track tout and that he
was murdered on the ocean beach by
race track sharps for betraying their
secrets. Mrs. Conness talks queerly at
times and the police do not place
much credence in her story.
Says That. Young Man Found on
Ocean Beach on Thursday Was
Murdered by Sharps.

PILLOW FOR THE DEAD
That family, no matter what part of
the world any branch of it might be,
or no matter what the different lan
guages the branches might speak, pre
served Its own literature, religion and
genius and maintained the associa
tions of olden times, together with its
moral and intellectual attributes.
Rabbi Voorsanger delivered an in
teresting lecture last night at Emaou-
El Sisterhood, 1248 Folsom street,
dealing with Jewish people, race and
nationality. With an intimate knowl
edge of the world's history from the
most remote ancient period the rabbi
traced the Hebrew, and, while to-day,
he said, the Jews were not a nation
because they were not endowed with
a country or political sovereignty, they
were remarkable in that hey are the
"only ancient family preserved in the
world."
Rabbi Voorsanger Says Hebrew Is the
"Only Ancient Family Preserved
in the World.
GIVES A LECTURE ON
1 JEWISH INDIVIDUALITY
The effort of Emily Fritz to obtain
a legal severance of the galling bonds
which bind her to John R. Fritz,
money lender, . was futile. Judge
Graham yesterday denied the wife's
prayer. Last spring Mrs. Fritz sued
for divorce on the ground of cruelty,
but after hearing the case Judge
Graham persuaded the couple to make
up. Soon afterward ehe renewed her
suit, again charging cruelty and al
leging that Fritz had struck her be
cause she stayed out too late visiting
a friend. The wife's evidence was
largely about her husband's penu
riousness. He got big returns by
placing some of his $20,000 at 4 per
cent a month, but only allowed his
better x half $7 a month to spend. It
was said that he measured the ham
and sugar to keep track of how much
she used.
On October 4 a final decree of di
vorce was entered In Judge , ; . Gra
ham's court for Richard F. Dawaon
from Elizabeth Dawson, and the man
was about to take another bride when
it was discovered that the interlo
cutory decree granted September 22,
1903, had not been docketed. This
necessitated the setting aside of the
final decree, and to straighten the
records the interlocutory decree was
entered on November 6 as of Sep
tember 22 of last year, and yesterday
another final decree was given. Daw
son may now marry again.
Divorces were granted yesterday by
Judge Murasky to Lillian V. Haed
rich from James Haedrich, desertion;,
by Judge Sloss to Sylvia A. Martin
from. Louis E. Martin, desertion; by
Judge Graham to Richard J. Curtin
from Mary Curtin, infidelity.
A suit for divorce on the ground of
cruelty was filed yesterday by Mrs. E.
M. Robinson against Thomas P. Rob
inson, a salesman for Brown &
Power, stationers. She says he earns
$250 a month and she asks. for $125
alimony and- $250 for counsel fees^
His abuse, according to the com
plaint, began a month after their mar
riage, In 1896. and continued until the
fourth of the present month, since
which time she has not seen him.
His favorite act of. cruelty was to
threaten to cut her throat with a
carving knife or a razor.
Other suits for divorce were filed
by Jennie. Olson against John Olson,
cruelty; Â¦ diaries GIbney against
Adelaide GIbney, "cruelty and deser
tion; Ella de Joia against Matteo-v de
Joia, Infidelity with May Thornton;
Alice Elizabeth Roberts against Ed
ward F. Roberts, cruelty; Dorrls D.
Ulrlch against John F. Ulrich, who Is
said to have received loving letters
from other women; Maggie Pitt
against W. J. Pitt, desertion; Calvin S.
Smith against Lottie Smith, desertion.
The birth of a posthumous child has
given Mrs. Minnie Kramm ' another
chance to bring an action against her
mother-in-law, Mrs. Augusta Simons,
for a share of her late-husband's estate,
and yesterday she began suit to recover
for the child what would have been its
father's share in the old Kramm prop
erty had he lived until he was 30 years
of age. '
The plaintiff in the case is the widow
of the late Henry C. Kramm, who at
his death disinherited her and left his
interest in the estate of his father to
his mother, Mrs. Augusta Simons. Mrs.
Kramm began a contest of the will, but
the proceedings were dismissed through
a compromise, whereby she -relin
quished her claim' for a sum exceeding
$2000. Her husband's interest in the es
tate of his father was valued at about
$14,000. '
Since the dismissal of the action, how
ever, a baby girl has been born to her,
and. she has now begun suit against
her mother-in-law on behalf of the
child. As the baby was not born at the
time of the compromise, she, of course,
was not included in the agreement, and
it is contended that she lost none of
her rights by the agreement made by
her mother.
The Baptist Ministers' Association
met yesterday and was addressed by.
the Rev. C. H. Cook of Bloomfleld, N.
k J., â¢', on- "Stewardship in the Local
Churches."
It was 'announced that the General
Baptist Convention of Northern and
Central California will meet in the
First Baptist Church, San Jose, from
November 9 to the 13th, inclusive.

fore the Presbyterian Ministers' Asso
ciation'yesterday on the question of
the proposed union of the Presbyterian
and. .the._ Cumberland Presbyterian
churches, as framed by the last Gen
eral Assembly.
Dr. Bush thought that the assembly
had allowed a momentary enthusiasm
on the abstract idea of union to blind
them as to certain Important consider
ations which made actual union un
wise.
The Rev. W. W. Case. D.D., of Sac
ramento attended the Methodist Min
isters* Association yesterday, and dur
ing an address on; aggTessive evangrel
istic effort he said the .work should be
pursued by the young members of

her signature to the following letter, praises
Lydia E* Pinkham's Vegetable Compound*
" Deab Mrs. Pet kiiaji : â There are but few wives and mothers "who
have not at times endured agonies and such pain as only women know.
I wish such women knew the value of Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound. It is a remarkable medicine, different in action from any
I ever knew and thoroughly reliable.
" I have seen cases where women doctored for years without perma-
nent benefit, who were cured in less than three months after taking your
Vegetable Compound, while others who were chronic and incurable
came out cured, happy, and in perfect health after a thorough treatment
with this medicine. I have never used it myself without gaining great
benefit. A few doses restores my strength and appetite, and tones up
the entire system. Your medicine has been tried and found true, hence
I fully endorse it." â Mks. R. A. Axdebson, 225 "Washington St., Jack-
sonville, Fla,
Mrs. Re<?d, 2425 E. Cumberland St., Philadelphia, Pa., says t
j&rÂ»&> u Deab Mks. Pikkdam: â I feel it my duty

iMwfiial W no b. enell k Two years ago I went under

lg|Â§a3Ha Â«==*Â» / condition. I had stomach trouble, backache,
|Ppa||Â§|3v / headache, palpitation of tbe heart, and was very
*S*^~&*zh**^ nervous; in fact, I ached all over. I find
K-'v"^ yours is the only medicine that reaches
' 9W i\ I\] Mv*/ WW*v sucl1 troubles, and would cheerfully reo-
PJ tin '/Mil V o^mend Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
*i Â« f:W, % 1 * Compound to all suffering women."
When women are troubled with irregular or painful menstruation, "weak-
ness, leUKorrhaea, displacement or ulceration of the womb, that bea.ring'-down
feeling 1 , inflammation of the ovaries, backache, flatulence, general debility,
indigestion, and nervous prostration, they should remember there is one tried
and true remedy. Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound at one*
removes such troubles.
The experience and testimony of some of the most noted
women of America go to prove, beyond a question, that Lydia E.
Pinkham's Vegetable Compound will correct all such trouble at
once by removing the cause and restoring the organs to a healthy
and normal condition. If in doubt, write Mrs. Pinkham at Lynn,
Mass, as thousands do. Her advice is free and helpful.
Xo other medicine for women in the world has received such wide-
spread and unqualified endorsement. Xo other medicine has such a
record of cures of female troubles. Refuse to buy any substitute.

BOSTON, Nov. 7. â The success of
the Roosevelt electors in Massachu
setts is conceded by the Democrats.
The Democrats claim the election of
William L. Douglas for Governor.
The influences which are expected to
bring this about are Governor Bates'
veto of . the overtime labor bill, the
increases in the Commonwealth's debt
and the sentiment in favor of a more
pronounced form of Canadian reci
procity than has been put forward by
the Republicans.
Republicans concede the Ninth and
Tenth Congressional districts to the
Democrats. The Democrats hope to
win in the Third, Fifth and Eleventh
districts.

TRENTON, N. J., Nov. 7. â The New
Jersey ' political campaign, which
closed to-day, was the most aggressive
since '1892, when the Democrats car
ried the State for Grover Cleveland.
The Republicans are confident of car
rying the State by from 35,000 to
40,000. The Democrats are claiming
that Parker will have a small plur
ality. . . J
The Democrats have made a strong
fight for Charles C. Black, for Gov
ernor, on a platform for the greater
taxation of railroads and are confident
of winning. The Republicans admit
that Edward C. Stokes, the candidate
for Governor, will run considerably
behind Roosevelt, but claim, that
Stokes will have from 10,000 to 20,000
plurality.

The man in the box was William
Armiger. He had imbibed "a little too
freely of the cup that cheers and also
inebriates. When he appeared in court
some hours later he took the pledge.
"I've had all I want," he said, with a
And there was reason for this quiv
ering of limbs, the blanching of cheeks
and fearful expression in the eyes of
the crowd. From out the black wagon
came uncanny sounds, sounds strange
to the ear and yet familiar. From a
safe distance the people craned their
necks and listened. This is what they
heard:
"Let me out. Let me out
let me out."
Curious looks were turned upon the
drivers of the wagon, Deputy Coroner
Ward and an assistant. They became
still more curious when a force of burly
bluecoats came running out of the po
lice station, grabbed the grewsome
looking black box that rested in the
wagon, dumped it out upon the ground
and with a lack of care that brought
gasps of awe from the crowd knocked
off the lid and unceremoniously emptied
its contents into the street.
Another gasp came from the crowd
when the "contents," after lying stiff
and prone upon the ground for a min
ute or two, displayed signs of life.
Then came a yell of dismay, for the
figure upon the ground Jumped to its
feet and made a rush at the crowd,
which scattered in every direction.
Explanations which turned the fright
ened crowd into a laughing 'one and
exposed the deputy coroner and his
assistant to unmerciful chaffing came
later. It appears that Ward was sum
moned by a woman to go to^the north
eastern part of town to get the body
of a dead man she said was lying in
the road. The deputy went and saw
what he took to be a corpse stretched
out upon the road- A cursory examina
tion satisfied him that the. man was
dead and the body was picked up and
dumped into the dead wagon. Hardly
had they gone half a block on the re
turn trip when Ward was startled by
a muffled yell from .the closed wagon.
Several, other yells followed in quick
succession, each being accompanied by
language that was unmistakable. "To
the Jail and not the morgue with this
load," said Ward to his assistant, and
he whipped up his horses and drove
like mad to the station.
SAN JOSE, Nov. 7.â The sight of the
morgue wagon ' being driven madly
through the streets of this city,yester
day caused a commotion. The unusual
spectacle attracted the attention of
hundreds and when the wagon was
pulled up in front of the police station
the entrance to the place was packed
with a crowd of the curious. Suddenly
the crowd melted away like chaff in the
path of the wind. Faces that a minute
before were flushed from the exertions
of their owners In following the dead
wagon became blanched. Eyes that
glittered with excitement became eyes
In which only fear was expressed, and
limbs that had carried their owners for
blocks at top speed without being
taxed became weak and quivered like
aspens.

Coach Lanagan is grieved over the
feeling of confidence that pervades the
Stanford campus. "Fe'w people realize,"
he said to-night, "the tremendous prop
osition which we have to face. The
talk that Stanford will defeat Berkeley
by a large score is all bosh. While we
have our strong points, we also have
weak ones that California is sure to
find. We will be excelled In the punt
ing game. There is not a natural punt
er on the squad and there has not been
time to develop" a first-class man. At
the end of the week, when the team is
finally picked, I can tell you more about
our chances."
The final team will not be picked un
til Friday. The men who are playing on
the varsity now and who seem quite
likely to maintain their positions are:
Captain Clark;, left end; Sprott, left
tackle; Thompson, left guard; Hyde,
center; Roosevelt, right guard; Shields,
right tackle; Smith, right end; Bans
bach, quarter: Dole, left half; Chalm
ers, right half, and Weller, fullback,
Treasurer Barrett received a telegram
to-day from the Western Maryland
College asking for a game. The request
will not be granted.
During the rest of this week Coach
Lanagan will devote all his attention
to the development of perfect team
work. It is the head coach's idea to put
forth a team so thoroughly drilled that
no sudden surprise sprung by Califor
nia will rattle the cardinal players and
allow the rival team to score during the
confusion. It is for this reason that so
many players have been used in the
preliminary games. This system enables
the substitutes to learn as much about
the game as the varsity players. There
are new formations to be learned, new
signals to be taught and new ways of
defense yet to be drilled into the men.
All this must be perfect, for the slip
of a signal is likely to turn victory into
defeat.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Nov. 7.â
Stanford's big football squad went into
secret practice to-night for the first
time this season. No one was admit
ted to the grounds, and great precau
tion was taken to prevent prying eyes
from watching the plays. Hereafter the
men will be taken into the gymnasium
every night and put through a rapid
fire signal practice for an hour or two.
On Friday afternoon of this week the
varsity will give an open practice, when
for a few minutes the successful candi
dates will go over their signals for the
last time before the intercollegiate
struggle with the eleven from the Uni
versity of California. On Saturday
morning the players will go to Berke
ley, and at 2:30 o'clock the fourteenth
annual football game will take place on
the California campus.

Young Corbett and "Battling" Nelson
have begun training for their battle-be
fore the Hayes Valley Club during the
last week of this month. Nelson is in
fairly good shape, as he has been ac
tively fighting during the last year. It
is nearly a year since Corbett has en
gaged in a battle and during this time
he has taken on many pounds of su
perfluous flesh, which will require some
hard work to get off.
In Nelson Corbett will meet one of
the strongest fighters he has ever en
countered. It will not do for him to
enter the ring in the same condition
as when he met Hanlon the first time.
Nelson is unusually game and has a
hard blow. Though he is regarded as
an awkward boxer he has a style in
which his opponent finds hard to guard
against.
The Yosemite Club has not decided
the attraction It will give the public
in December. The winner of the Cor
bett-Nelson fight and Britt would make
a strong card and it is likely that they
will be matched.

In the other races to-day there was
reasonable adherence to recent form
except when Fleur de Marie won the
first race. Sha was well backed.
When she last ran Cochran rode her
and she went up from 4 to 8 to 1,
finishing fourth. Among those who
beat her then was Cairngorm. who
to-day was beaten by her at the same
nlaT.rc difference in weights. Fleur
de Marie was off in front in that
race. To-day she was off second, but
went right on in punrjit of the leader
and. assuming command on the far
turn, was not again headed, though
she interfered with Austin Allen,
besides bumping Cairngorm. No
claim of foul was made.

a race to-day. With a bit of luck to
day's winner, Thespian, might have

case of Catarrh, and took a great deal of
medicine withont any benefit.
I bad a continual headache, my cheeks
had grown purple, my nose was always
flopped up, znyoreath had a sickening and
disgusting odor, and I coughed incessantly
I heard cf your S. S. S. and wrote you.
I commenced to use it, and after taking
several bottles I was cured and have
never since had the slightest symptom of
the disease. Miss Mary L. Storm.

I had Nasal Catarrh for years for which I
used S. S. S. with very gratifying results.
' I tried local applications for some time,
1 and getting no permanent relief I came to
Â» the conclusion that the seat of the trouble
was in the blood. Knowing S. S. S. to be
a good blood medicine I began its use,
and after using it for some little while it
did away entirely with the offensive mu>
cus in the nostrils, and I did not have to
hawk and spit, especially in the morning,
to dislodge the catarrhal matter.

Cook Ilns a Hot Ship.
Captain Cook cf the whaler Bowhead. now up
north, is. by all accounts, the terror of the
Arctic. Nearly every blubber hunter that sails
home brings a runaway from Cock's crew.
TY-.et*: human d*reilctsÂ«firiftlng out from among
the bergs in the upper reaches of the frigid
f*M tell tha same stcry of needless hardships
Â«r.3 s*nÂ«eleÂ»s brutality caused by the Bowhead's
fkipper end hip rr.ates. In the whaling fleet
It is reported that Cock's stock boast in that
no skipper In the Arctic can catch a runaway
Â«a!lor on the Jce quicker than he.
Walter Welle, who Jumped the Bowhead and
lived asicr.g. the Indians for some time, finally
corning, home on the Narwhal, pays It !.Â« Cap
tain Cock's delight to abuse his crew. Wells
slipped away from the Bowhead. he says, to
keep from being beaten for some trivial of
l*nÂ«e. He suffered great hardships treklng
o%-er the ice and frozen tundra, but this was
preferable to life on the Bewheud. Wells nays
he saw two young men â mere boys â put down
In the cold, empty ho!3 In irons and beaten by
Captain Cock. They had tried to desert and
were caurht oflt en the lee. Cook declared he
saved their lives by bringing th*rn back to
thÂ« ship, fo says Wells, and possibly the cap
tain rewarded hlÂ» own humane act by thus
abusing the runaways. So Captain Cook of the
whaler Bowhead is known among the blubber
hunters es the ekipper who has a hot ship even
in the bitter cold oi a frigid Arctic winter.

SAN FRANCISCO IN IilNE.
The Governor's plan Is undoubtedly
to house all the California exhibits at
Portland under one roof. While the
exhibitors here are almost unanimous
in the qpinion that the State can secure
the most effective representation in
this way, there are some who will op
pose the plan because they want their
counties to have full independence and
show whatever they wish and snow it
in their own manner. *
Frank J. Symmes while here said
that it was San Francisccfs duty to
make a display at Portland and help
the exposition there in every way.
"Not only is it a duty on the part of
San Francisco," he said, "but it is good
policy, tor the benefits we have derived
from the St. Louis Fair show us that
there Is much to be gained by exhibit-
Ing at Portland. "We cannot erect a
building there, but we can get space
and make a good exhibit with what we
have here. The committee will take up
the matter at once."

With SCOO barrels of lime burning in

er Challenger made a race along the"
coast for this port. She sailed from
iloche Harbor. Washington, a few days
:igo. bound for San Francisco. She
liso bad 155.000 feet of lumber in the |
and on deck. A few hours out
r.eated air was noticed coming up
:hrough the hatch and an examination
I 'roved that the lime in some of the
tiarrels had become damp and was
apidly slaking. The heat engendered
: Â¦Â¦>â¢ the chemical change was beginning
o make things torrid about the decks
md the schooner was /put to her best
-peed.
A coal cargo will burn slowly and the
iiroir.pt scuttling of the ehip will
quench the flre and possibly save the
reeaeL Lime heats rapidly and the
hemical change, once begun, cannot
e checked till the cargo is all slaked
and ruined. So the Challenger was
loomefl and the only course open to
he captain was to get the schooner In
port before she became too * hot for
habitation and then sink her in shallow
r.tter, let the lime burn itself out and
s^riouEly damage the vessel, as it was
ocund to do. and thus save the lum
ber.
All tall was kept on. even when half
-. gale was blowing. The schooner
with all four of her sticks straining in
:heir steppings fairly flew over the
wave* for the Golden Gate. Hatches
A-ere fastened down. but nothing
i ould be done to cool the furnace be
low. The decks over the heating bar
rels v.-Â£re becoming hot and threaten
ing to buckle, but Captain Nelson told
the men to keep off the hot planks
;<nd save their shoe soles, while he
watched the water rushing astern and
wished he could make torpedo-boat
epeed.
Quicklime is not a misnomer, even
when it is eating up a ship, and yes
terday morning when the Challenger
was ofT South Bend, Washington, the
crew left the hot hull and came ashore
in one of the boats. A tug was sent
out from the port and the schooner
towed into the harbor, where she was
hastily scuttled on a mud flat. She
will lie there till the lime ie slaked.
Captain Woodside of the Pacific
Stevedoring- a.nd Ballasting Company
said last night that the lime was a
total loss, of course, and the vessel
was ruined. He had learned that
i"aptain Nelson was stripping the
schooner of sails and gear, and would
; ave all the lumber possible. Captain
Woodsio> v.-ill start for South Bend
this morning and after completing the
Ftripp'ng of the wreck will dispose of
It for what it will bring.
CALL BUREAU, PRESS BUILDING,
ST. LOUIS, Nov. 7.â Studies of the
Louisiana Purchase Exposition are be
ing made by San Francisco business
men who are interested in the project
of holding a world's fair in that city
upon the completion of the Panama
canal. Several leading citizens of San
Francisco have devoted much of the
time occupied by their visits at this fair
in making observations and gathering
data to be used in conneotlon with the
proposed San Francisco exposition.
Two points these observers have all
agreed uponâ that any exposition in
San Francisco must be smaller than
this one, and that it must have novel
ties that will give it a distinct interest
over the last two American World's
Fairs. There are general lines that can
not be abandoned in giving a fair, but
those who give one after this must
search the world and inspire the mind
of genius to secure at least a few nov
elties if a great success Is to be
achieved.
SHOULD ELIMINATE GRAFT.
â¢R. B. Hale, who has been one of the
most prominent men in the movement
for a San Francisco exposition, was the
first to study the St. Louis Fair In con
nection with that project. He visited
the officials* of the Louisiana Purchase
Exposition and obtained a good gen
eral idea of the workings of the various
departments and the benefit of the ex
perience of the men he visited. An
drew Davis, vice president of the Mer
chants'. Association, accompanied him.
Later-Messrs. Symmes, Jennings, Bbar
boro and others took notes here for use
should San Francisco decide to give a
fair, and the variety of knowledge
gleaned by them will make the next
meeting in behalf of the suggested ez
position an interesting one.
They all agree that if San Francisco
gives a fair she can and should make a
record by excluding abuses practiced
at world's expositions up to date,
through which both exhibitors and vis
itors suffer. There has probably never
been given a fair at which there was
not a laxity regarding the throttling of
"graft." , ,- .. : , ..
CALIFORNIANS: NEED FURS. '
It looks as if the Louisiana Purchase
Exposition promoters forgot that the
weather grew cold In Missouri In win
ter time when they decided to run the
fair a month longer than the Chicago
Exposition. The big exhibit buildings
are" beginning to get chilly inside, and
November has not begun to do its
worst yet. The California exhibitors
are beginning to long for a few in
voices of their salubrious home climate.
In the Palace of Agriculture, where
most of them are, the problem of keep
ing warm when the thermometer takes
a still greater drop is becoming a seri
ous one.
Oil heaters are not allowed in any
building and gas is not practical in the
larger ones. There is hardly any sort
of a fire, anyway, except an eruption
of Vesuvius, that would have much ef
fect In a shell-like building covering
twenty-two acres. The Calif ornlans
will either have to establish a running
track around their -exhibit or wrap
themselves in furs if they remain to
show their oranges and grapes to the
hardy Norwegians and Danes who go
into the building. They are hoping that
the majority of the November days will
be fairly comfortable.
NO SALE FOR BUILDINGS.
States and nations that have erected
buildings on the fair grounds are try-
Ing hard to get something for the
structures at the close of the fair. It is
surprising how little an exposition
structure is worth after the season has
ended. The highest bid that has been
made for the California f building is
$150. One contractor made an offer of
$30 for it. The fact that it took a medal
doesn't seem to make it one bit more
valuable. It can't stay where it is, and
the man who pulls it down will not get
much more than a plla of plaster and
some doors, mantels and ' grates.
No offer has yet been made for the
San Francisco building, though it has
been .offered to any one who will buy.
The contractors who erected It will not
give a cent for it, nor for any other
building they have put up on the
grounds. It Is possible, however, that
a few hundred dollars may be obtained
for it, as it contains some good lumber
and some redwood doors and casings
that are of value. The smallness of
the bids offered indicates that St. Louis
has some secret kindling supply, that
she never told exhibitors about when,
she induced them to come here and
erect buildings.
A gold medal banner has been hung
over the entrance to the San Francisco
building reception room and San Fran
ciscans who call at the structure and
see It will have occasion to feel a
pride in the exhibit made by their
home city. ' ; â¢' .'
"TURNING TOWARD PORTLAND.
It 'seems that Governor Pardee has
well defined Ideas as to what sort", of
a building California should have at
Portland during the Lewis and Clark
centennial, and that he Is already well
Into the matter 'of establishing Cali
fornia's/exhibit there. A member of
an Oakland firm of contractors, which
has already ; done some construction
work at the Portland fair, has. writ
ten here asking information - concern-
Ing the California State, building at St.
Louis and as to what exhibits' that
State has here that. are most worthy
to go to the Oregon metropolis. An
excerpt, from the letter, which shows
something of the style â¢ of structure
contemplated for the Portland fair Is
as follows:* . jfsHSI
"I am trying to .aid the Governor to
plan a California building suitable for
headquarters and at the same time for
a',- large part of California's exhibits.

Uricsol,
the only cvre for
Rheumatism.
If you ere suffering from rheuma-
tism there is a chance for you to be-
come absolutely cured. You may
cure yourself and do it quickly if you
will lay aside your prejudice and
skepticism.
Every San Francisco druggist sells
Uricsol, the well-known remedy, and
we hereby authorize them to guaran-
tee a cure. v _/
Uricsol cures rheumatism in the only
possible way it can be cured.
Uric Acid and Urates are the cause
of Rheumatism. These are deposited
in the ; tissues, blood vessels and joint3
of the body.
These deposits must be dissolved
and eliminated from the system be-
fore a cure can be accomplished.
Uricsol is a solvent of these and
tones up the system, stimulates the
kidneys, liver a.nd bowelo and thus
drives them from the system.
Uricsol is harmless, and no injuri-
ous results can possibly come to any
part of your body.

taining recommended diet for "rheu-
matics.

This Is quite a good picture of Miss
Kate Erhardt. who lives at 518 Fie; ave-
nue. Santa Barbara. Cal. Miss Erhardt
had suffered for years with distressing
asthma. It is needless to describe
asthma to the unfortunates who Â»uffer
from this awful disease. All sufferers
from asthma realize what It means to
smother and cough and flght for breath
as the majority of these sufferers have
to do when a bad paroxysm of asthma
comes on. Miss Erhardt suffered from
the worst form of asthma for years,
was taking all kinds of medical treat-
ment, which did her no good. She cam*
to the Electro-Chemic Institute. IIS
Grant avenue. San Francisco, and took
Just six weeks' treatment. In that time
she was thoroughly cured of her asthma
and has now returned to her home in
Santa Barbara thoroughly and perma-
nently cured. Such cures as this is con-
stantly adding additional proof that the
Electro-Chemic treatment does cure
diseases which In the past have been in-
curable under the ordinary medical
treatment used for them. Any one is at
liberty to write Miss Erhardt and she
will be only too glad ta.subgtantlate this
statement in every particular. Such
cures as this explain why the Electro-
Chemic practice is now the largest spe-
cial practice on the Pacific Coast. It ex-
plains why other, physicians with a few
electrical Instruments are trying to imi-
tate Electro-Chemistry. Such rures
should make it plain to all sufferers if
they desire an absolutely reliable treat-
ment they should try to go to the orig-
inal Institution, the ElÂ«rtro-Chemie In-
stitute, which Is meeting with such un-
qualified success. The specialists of the
Electro-Chemic Institute Invite all suf-
ferers to call for free consultation, ex-
amination and advice. The afflicted
should remember that the Electro-
Chemic practice is the most successful
treatment known for the cure of Ca-
tarrh, Consumption, Asthma. Bronchitis,
Deafness, Ringing Ears. Rheumatism.
Paralysis. Locomotor Ataxla. Neuralgia.
Cancers. Tumors. Old Sores. Eczema,
Dyspepsia, Liver Trouble. Kidney and
Blarlder troubles, Bright's Disease.
Piles. Fistula. Constipation. Headaches.
Dizziness. Insomnia, Epilepsy. Stricture.'
Prostatitis. Female Irregularities. Mis-
placements, Ovaritis, Pain in Back,
etc. The Electro-Chemic Institute is
centrally located at US Grant ave-
nue, corner of Post street. San Fran-
cisco. There are private apartments
set aside for ladies and gentlemen, and
the office hours are daily from 9 in the
morning until 6 In the afternoon, and 7
to 8 at night, and Sundays from 10 in
the morning until 1 in the afternoon.
The Electro-Chemic treatment is abso-
lutely painless. Small children and
even babies are now taking it without
the least complaint. It is the most won-
derful treatment known for shattered
nerves, and in those bad cases where
the physical strength is all gone the pa-
tient is built up and made stronger and
thoroughly cured so quickly that it is
almost Impossible to realize the change
in the sufferer. All are welcome, but no
Incurable eases are accepted.

PUBLIC "FREE HEALING"~before audience
TO-DAY. 2 and 8 p. m. (Office hours 2 to 7.)
RADIUM HALL, 783^ Market and 1 Fourth
(corner Market and Fourth.) _____
"NON-MEDICAL" humanized Radium power ia
(solely) used In Rexradlo's treatments; no
medicine, no medical Instruments used.
"NAMES" and testimonials of patients al-
luded to BELOW shown at offices.
"DEAF MUTES"â Several k recently made to
hear and SPEAK what they heard. Numer-
*ous witnesses, one being Mr. Butler, well-
known S. F. CHRONICLE representative.
"TOTAL DEAFNESS" Rexradlo finds to be a
mere BAGATELLE; nearly every case ."be-
gins" to hear "whispered" words after 3 sec-
onds' treatment. (Deaf .mutes the same.)
"OSSIFIED >r LADY7 Mr^KnowiesTlm Bart-
lett. by (one) treatment had her locked AN-
CHYLOSED Joints made freely "movable"
several weeks ago; no "relapse," but still
Â¦ further progress to date.
"BUNDXESS" eeemed Imminent; within 3
u&ye Rexradlo restored good sight.
"LEAPING" CRIPPLE; paralysis; dragged
foot, limb nearly "powerless"; 10 second*'
treatment and I LEAPED before audience."
"LONG DISTANCE^ HEARING. My ear to-
tally deaf from childhood; by 1 treatment
heard (whisper) af 70 feet."
"FEMALE WEAKNESS"â My trouble waÂ»
quickly removed by Rexradlo.
"â¢CANCER" disappeared In one hour after
Rexradlo's (one) treatment.
"UP IN THE AIR" In elevator with man
having "crooked" arm. Couldn't straighten
It. Rexradlo was there, too, and by "mo-
ment's" touch straightened It before descend-
ing elevator stopped. Editor of TOWN TALK
was pre!Â«ent. Witnessed by me â WILLIAM
ORMSBY.
"BEDRIDDEN"â I saw Rexradlo treat man
for years "helpless" In bed. had to be
"lifted" in and out of bed: Instantly rose
(unaided) from bed. Other similar cases.
"REXRADIO'S" (one) treatment straightened
1 my "bent" limb (rheumatism).
"TYPHOID FEVER" overcome by only two
treatments; no RELAPSE.â Knott. 112 Fell.
"LOCO'dOTOR* ATAXIA"â Couldn't stand un-
supptrted; 1 treatment Tuesday and Instant-
ly stood, walked "unsupported." - >..J '~
"ANCHYLOSIS" of knee; couldn't straighten
leg or move knee; did both Instantly. ,-.*,,
"HE SEES" objects (outlines) at 80 feet;
eyes "blind" 7 years (I treatment Tuesday).
"REXRADIO'S" 1 treatment entirely removed
my "dropsy" and straightened limb.
"SUICIDE" avoided; protracted disease ren-
dered life a burden; orten thought of sui-
cide, after spending largely, vainly, for re-
lief; then Rexradlo made quick, complete
cure, months ago; no RELAPSE. .-.- ;',Â¦Â¦
"REXRADIO'.' rescued me quickly from the
fiery purgatory of "neuralgia." Â¦ :Â¦'Â¦â¢
"ANCHYLOSIS of Joints, knees, ankles, hips,
toes, fingers, wrists, elbows, shoulders, neck,
etc., which others deem 'Incurable,' have
often yielded to Rexradlo' s very nrst treat-
ment.' " Testimonials shown.
"PAINS" Of all kinds (neuralgia, sciatica,
rheumatism, gout etc.) usually have been
expelled by Rexradio's "first" treatment.
Proofs â Numerous testimonials. --~-yv
"RESURRECTION" excepted. BROKER, one
of our leading citizens, recently (publicly)
said: "I have seen Rexradio do nearly in-
credible healing wonders -In my office. I
verily believe he can do almost anything but
RAISE THE DEAD. I am ready to put up
my money on it" ' Â¦'Â¦'<â¢Â¦--
"$1000 FORFEIT' if above digests w cases are
not "genuine." Stacks of testimonials.
"NOTE THIS" â Names of all above patients
given at offices to persons similarly afflicted;
we object to "publication" of their, names.
Above "digests" of cases refer to results of
"first" treatment, which benefits usually be-
come, perfect and permanent after a few
"further" treatments.. ,
"REXRADIO" can and does DO ALL HE
CLAIMS TO DO. HE FEARLESSLY CHAL-
LENGES COURTEOUS (CRUCIAL) INVES-
TIGATION. .

The most remarkable contest was In
the district of Castel-Franco. compris
ing the birthplace of the Pope. Count
dl Macola, who killed Signor Cavallot
tl, the famous Radical leader, in a duel,
has always been re-elected on the first
ballot, but yesterday, although sup
ported by the Clericals, the Count, who
is a personal friend of the Pope, did
not receive sufficient votes in his con
test against the Democrat and Minis
terial candidate, Slgnor Pellegrini, a
stanch advocate of divorce, and Ma
colo must try to win on a second bal
lot. As
signor Masl, former minister of pub
lic instruction, and a fugitive from
justice, accused of peculation, was re
elected unanimously by his fellow
townsmen at Trapani as a protest
against the charges brought against
him, the people of Trapani not believ
ing him guilty.
Signor Paloizzolo, who is considered
to be the head of the Mafia secret so
ciety, was a candidate at Palermo, but
he received only 289 votes to 125S votes
cast for his opponent, who was elected.
ROME, Nov." 7.â Definite returns show
that all the members of the Cabinet
have been re-elected. Former Premier
Rudini, Baron Donnlni, leader of the
constitutional opposition, and Prinet
ti. the former Foreign* Minister, and
Ferri, the Socialist leader, have also
been re-elected.
Summing up the result it is estab
lished that the Government has been
victorious over the Extremists, who
lost twenty seats. Turin, Naples, Pa
lermo and almost all the large towns
joined Milan . and Genoa in defeating
the Extremists, as a manifestation
against the general strike. This really
was the predominant note in the elec
tions.

expectation, so far as It was regiMTed in

conr~Â»rt in the leadership of the market for

while they did not fully retrieve their posi

Cheese remains firm, with stocks light.
The situation in Eggs, like that in Butter,
is very much at sea. It li doubtful whether
anybody can quote an accurate market at pres
ent, for there are no fine ranch of -any conse
quence here. Some dealers said if they had
any they could get anything they had the face
to ask â even five or ten cents higher than the
top quotation. In fact, there are really no
quotations. Tho.re below are about as close as
can be given under the circumstances.
Receipts were 35,200 lbs Butter, 475 cases
Eggs and 0100 lbs Cheese.
The situation in Butter is very mixed. It Is
briefly this: .Most houses are steady at the
recent decline, but several, who are excessive
ly overloaded, are doing their best to smash
the market down to 20c, so that they can sell
sundry cars for shipment to the East and thu?
clear off their holdings. They are in a minori
ty, however. The ruling price for fancy cream
ery yesterday was 22c. Anything over was a
premium price and anytJling under 21>4c was
a bear drive to hammer the market down.

being very little demand for anything, and
prices of all descriptions were largely nom

late on Saturday was on sale, and more than
half of it was still unsold at the close. Re

there was plenty of held-over stock on hand.

Trade in Potatoes was of a light Jobbing
character, being confined entirely to the filling
of small orders for ordinary local want*.
Strictly fancy lots of Salinas Burbanka ware
held at a alight advance, while common of
ferings of that description continued weak at
irregular rates. The market was still badly
congested with river Burbanks, which con
tinued to arrive freely, and the top quota
tion was shaded. There was another sharp
break in Sweet Potatoes, 5 carloads of fresh
stock being thrown upon an already over
loaded market. Onions were firm and un
changed.
Changes in miscellaneous vegetables were
slight, stock* of everything except Summer
Squash being well up to requirements. There
was' quite a large supply of intermediate crop
Rhubarb received from acrose the bay. which
met with a good demand at 60@75o per box.

The Coffee Situation.
The New York circular of Henry Nordlin*er
R <_Â¦Â». taj-E:
â¢The most important factor governing the
*>rt>rct crop sea*on is that the world consumes
tnoTv Brazil o.ftee than is being produced.
Eot a mere matter of a Itw hundred thousand
taj-s a* uat the cat* last year, but at least
J..^iO.twO to 2.OOO,<K0 bags more. Thts" Ftate
tuent on our part at the present time may ap-
Jxrar strange when we are face to face with the
r:*rgf-M visible' supply the world ever had.
Che causi-s which brought about this etate of
â¢ ffalrs are that Brazilian crops have t*en
rushed forward to eh!;pir.g port* during the
pas=: four months at an extraordinarily rapid
r*i*: altogether about 6.200,000 bags Brazil
CoSVe (including Victorias and Bahias) have
come icto eight duricg that time, being an
Â«r.usuaJ:y lar^e jh rcentage of the crop. Con
Â«'jir.ptlon although somewhat backward, has
tak>n its usual quantity of about 3.S50.000
bags of Brazil cufftf. The difference of 2.-
S5c.iiOO 1j&<:s. no small item, having been
Biici to the visible supply. Had the Bra
i;:;an crops not come forward at euch an ex
traordinary rate, we wouid not have the big;
visible supply which U now staring us in the
Sao*, bui the coffee would have existed on
the plantations Just the same, although un
counted, and It would have come into right
later in the yeai. It would then not have
fc*-en felt to the same extent, however, because
h longer period of consumption would ha\ - e
Acted ax a. fair ctso;.
"The period cf hea\T receipts Â»t Braxillan
â¢hipping ports lc now at an end. and a con
â¢iaera.ble falling off will be experienced this
month, becoming more acutÂ« later on. The
monthly increases in the \iaible Eupply of
the world have likewise now come to a close
Sor the present crcp year, and continuous de
creases win occur from now on in a more or
ksp accentuated degree.
â¢ There ar* to come- forward at Rio and
Cantos during thÂ« next eight month* about
S.ikiu.OOO bags, and pofaibly 3,500,000 bags
(the latTer a maximum figore), agalnft a
Srosj>ective consumption of Braxtl Coffee for
that j*-riod o? abuut 7.75O.O00 bags. It must.
therefore, appear clear tttit the time for a
*u :*:ar.;;el uplifting cf values Is near at
hand, if it has not already arrived.
'"The United Stales more than anr other
country has bocjrl.t freely o? the current crop.
while Europe has been very backward this
your in making J.rr pufchases. The time is
now approaching when the Brazilians will be
able to take rare- of the remainder of their
crop without aselFtance from. consuming
countries. Purchases of large blocks will
th<rrtfore not be so readily effected from now
or.. European port stocks of Brazil Coffee at
thp pre^M writ:r.g are about 1.250,000 bags
err:a!ler than they were at the same time last
year and the afloats to Europe are about half
& miMion b&R* l*rs; both of which, we think,
ar<^ strong f<-aturee for the market.
"When we come to consider the prospect*
Icr the 1VCS-0S crop indications are that the
Santos crop will not be any larger and poÂ«-
BiMy a good deal smaller than the present
or- : while the Rio crop, that is, the crop pro-
Cuced in the statf* of Rio an-1 Minis, prom-

Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO. Nov. 7.â Reporu of unfavorable
weather were the principal cause of the firm
tone in wheat here to-day. At the dose both
the December and May deliveries werÂ« up
%Â©%c. Corn is up %@%c. Oats were- un
changed. Provisions are-2%@15c higher.
Strength in the wheat pit developed early
in the session. Under the Influence of liberal
world's shipments and lower cables thÂ» mar
ket opened easier, December being down y t c
at $1 11%. May was off a shade to %c at
$1 11>4@1 11% ho $1 11%. Pit traders were
the principal tellers at the start. Offerings
were taken quite readily by commission houses.
As a result of continued dry weather in the
Southwest sentiment in the pit changed
quickly to the bull side. Many of the early
sellers became buyers, the result being a
eudden advance, December selling up to
$1 12%. Meantime May advanced to $1 12%.
Part of the rain wu lost later in the day on
profit -taking 1 , but a firm undertone was mani
fested throughout the remainder of tho ses
sion. Advices from Argentina Indicated that
the weather there was too wet. These ru
mors induced realizing by shorts and were
largely responsible for the firm tone of the
market. On the whole trading was of light
volume, the holiday to-morrow being a drag
on the market. The close was firm, with-De
cember at $1 12KÂ©1 12%. May closed at
$1 11%61 11%.,
Higher cables and the strength of wheat
caused a firm tone In the corn market. The
volume of trading, was small. December
opened %CHic higher at 48%c. sold between
48%c and 48%c and closed at 48%c.
' There was a fair demand In oats, but prices
showed practically no change. December
closed at 28%c.
Provisions were strong on a fair demand
from packers. At the close January pork was
up 12%@15c ' lard and ribs were each un

for grading purposes in the Po

pleted and a locomotive and several
cars were being backed into the yards
for the night. Spicer should have
thrown the switch to a side track,. but
instead he left -it on the main line
and the train, . which was moving at
a fair rate of speed, -crashed Into,sev
eral empty cars. Spicer was caught
in the jam and killed. The cars were
thrown from the track and several
hundred dollars' worth of damage
was done. Rpicer was 27 years of age,

Two years ago Dr. Stinson was "ap
pointed a member of the Board of
Health as the successor of Dr. Wil
liamson, and is now the senior member
of that body.
When asked yesterday concerning his
resignation the doctor said he had been
considering it for some time, and he
added that he regretted severing the
friendly, business relations that exist
between himself and the other members
of the board. Lately he has missed sev
eral meetings of the board, and he
considers it his duty to resign in order
that his place may be filled by some
other. physician who can give the proper
attention to the city's affairs.
Dr. J. Coplln Stinson has resigned his
position as a member of the Board of
Health. His letter of resignation was
handed to Mayor Schmitz yesterday
and was accompanied by a request that
It be acted on . at the earliest conve
nience of his Honor. Dr. Stinson at
tributes his retirement from the board
to two reasons, one being that his pri
vate affairs prevent him from devoting
the necessary attention to the business
of the board, and the other that he is
contemplating a trip-abroad and is anx
ious to free himself of all local respon
sibilities.

Frank Barry, the 3-year-old son of

Shipley street, was knocked down and
killed by an electric car early last
evening on Fourth, street, near Fol

tured and his body was badly
mangled.
According to the story told by the
boy's parents, he had been missing
from his home " but a ' few; moments
when news of the Â¦ accident was
brought to them. It appears that the
lad was attempting to cross the track,
when he stumbled and fell directly in
front of a north-bound car. Before
Motorman George M. Eaglin could ap
ply the brakes the child was killed.
Eaglin was later arrested and charged
with manslaughter, at the Central po
lice station.

Within the 'last month 2500 circu
lars were distributed in Sacramento
and a great number of these brought
results. The company announced that
a friend of the lady to whom the cir
cular was addressed had won a prize
In its "guessing contest" and that this
friend wished to tender the prize to
her. It requested that 30 cents b<*
forwarded for the purpose of paying
postage. In this way the concern
made its profits. Jurgens admits that
but few premiums were ever sent and
that the concern was not legitimate.
He says he was j employed by a man
named George H. Marshall and that
he had no other interest in it than
that of an employe. Marshall, he
says, left for Â«St Louis last Friday.
Captain Burnett is Inclined to dis
credit Jurgens' story and thinks that
Marshall is only a myth.
W. F. Jurgens, the agent of the "G.

REVERED MAN
PASSES AWAY
AT GREAT AGE
Unger is a popular man about town,
being a member of the Olympic and the
Family clubs. Race track gambling Is
given as the cause that led him to, go
wrong. He Is living at 1416 Fell street
and had been in the Custom-house ser
vice for nearly thirty years. He was
in hiding yesterday. To all inquiries
made at his residence the answer was,
"Xot at home." He was not to be found
at the clubs. He has disappeared from
I all his old haunts. Meanwhile the clos
! est reticence regarding the affair is ob
served by the Federal employes.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 7.â Seizure
Clerk Cress Unger of the customs ser
vice at' San Francisco has been report
j ed here as 6hort in his accounts a few
I hundred dollars and has been suspend
ed pending an investigation. Unger was
formerly chief clerk, but was found
faulty, principally on account of
carelessness in the conduct of his work,
j and was taken from his place and
j given a less responsible position. In his
I new position Unger \ had considerable
opportunity for defalcation or diversion
of funds.but his shortage, so far. as yet
appears, does not amount to a large
sum.
In February, 1902, Unger was elevated
from the position of seizure clerk in the
Collector's office to the position of chief
clerk in the customs service. In June,
1903, he resigned, giving as the cause
that the duties were too arduous. He
then resumed the. duties of seizure
clerk, and the real cause of the change
in the service was kept quiet.
But it is now said that when Unger
left the position of seizure clerk in
February, 1902, he was short in his ac
counts about $2000. This, it is alleged,
he attempted to make good by turning
in payments of from $200 to $300 a
month. Unger's successor, Henry Farm
er, reported the shortages to Collector
Stratton, and it is now given out that
Unger was forced to resign his position
as chief clerk. Whatever money was
stolen was made â¢ good and the crime
was kept quiet. Farmer succeeded
Unger as chief clerk, and the stealings
would not have been discovered had
not Unger continued his peculations.
But Unger found the temptations of
the seizure clerk's position too strong
for him. For several months It has
been suspected that valuable articles
of jewelry have been stolen from the.
mails! Investigation showed that the
stuff had been turned over to Unger. It
could be traced no farther.
When the seizure clerk learned that
his doings had been discovered he re
signed. Collector Stratton declined to
accept the resignation and suspended
Unger until- the situation can be sifted
to the bottom. . .
Regarding Unger's troubles, Stratton
declines to be interviewed.
"I must refer you to the authorities
at Washington," he said. "This is de
partmental business and I am not per
mitted, to discuss It. I can say that
Mr. Unger is suspended for cause."
As soon as the discovery of Unger's
second offense was made" Stratton
placed the case in the hands of Special
Treasury Agents West* and Channing.
They referred the . facts to the United
States District Attorney, who is absent
from the city. His return is expected
soon and then the charges will be taken
up. '
It is rumored that this is not the first
time that Unger has been under a
cloud in the same office. The other, his
accusers say, was smoothed by the in
fluence of friends.
cause their contents are deemed of lit
tle value.
EEIZURE CLERK IN THE CUSTOM
HOUSE WHO HAS BEEN SUS
PENDED.
Though a record of all packages
turned over to the seizure clerk is kept
by the Custom-house clerk who has
charge of foreign mail matter at the
ferry postoffice. the authorities are not
prepared to say how many people have
been fleeced in this manner. Some of
the parcels are not recorded at all, be-
The extent of Unger's peculations is
not known, but it exceeds $1500. The
seizure clerk handles all parcels from
European and Asiatic ports suspected
to contain dutiable goods. Some of
thepe are examined at the postoffice j
building at the ferry, others, sealed j
packages especially, are marked "bus- !
pected" and referred to the office of i
tho Collector of the Port. _ The charge j
made against T'nger is that he received
the dex>osits made on valuable parcels
and kept the money.
Cress Unger, seizure clerk in the of

BEAUTY OF SKIN
PURITYOFBLOOD
Ancient and Modern Ideas od
These Interesting
Subjects.
UP-TO-DATE METHODS
For Purifying and Beautifying
tbe Skin, Scalp, Hair
and Hands.
Socrates called beauty a short-lived
tyranny, Plato a privilege of nature, .
Theocritus, a delightful prejudice,
Theopbrastus a sliest cheat, Carneades
a solitary kingdom, Homer a glorious
gift of nature, Ovid a favor of the
gods. Aristotle affirmed that beauty
was better than all the letters of rec-
ommendation la the world, and yet
none of these distinguished authorities
has left us even a hint of how beauty
Is to be perpetuated, or the ravages of
ege and disease defied. Time soon
blends the lily and tbe rose into the
pallor of age, disease dots tbe fair face
with cutaneous disfigurations and
crimsons the Roman nose with unsight-
ly flushes, moth, if not rust, corrupts
the glory of eyes, teeth, and lips yet
beautiful by defacing the complexion,
and fills the sensitive soul with agony.
If such be the unhappy condition of
one afflicted with slight skin blemishes, Â¦
wh&t must be the feelings of those In
whom torturing humors have for
years run riot, covering the skin with
scales and sores and charging the
blood with poisonous elements to be-
come a part of the system until death?
It is in tbe treatment of torturing,
disfiguring humors and affection* ol
tbe skin, scalp and blood, with loss ol
hair, that tbe Cuticura remedies have
achieved their greatest success. Orig-
inal in composition, scientifically com-
pounded, absolutely pure, unchange-
able in any climate, always ready, and
agreeable to the most delicate and sen-
Eitive, they present to young and old
the most successful curatives of mod-
era times. fflffSfij
