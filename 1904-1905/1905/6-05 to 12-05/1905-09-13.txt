tricts participated in the caucus. It was
Â£-roply demonstrated that the leasne
forces will have a' majority of sixty votes
in the convention and be able to nominate
the ticket throughout.
Ruers efforts to break the league col

cates of a clean" administration did not
yield to threats, intimidation or blandish
ment. Every inducement known to poli
ticians was held out to prevent a majority
of the delegates from entering the antl
liuff caucus, but the boss of the Schmitz
administration was outgeneraled and de
feated at every point of contact.
The caucus of the majority was called
to order by George D. Clark, chairman of
the league, at 9:15 o'clock. The roll was
called and 224 delegates responded in per
son. Later four more delegates took their
respective places in the hall.

hive Authorized by the Delegates.
Continued from Page 1, Column 1.
Leagrue knowe that a majority of the (people
of San Francjfcco are honest and do not stand
for mls-g-ovtrnment ; and
Whereas. The San Francisco Republican
League knows full well that If this ma
jority of the people If not torn apart by
partisan fee. lng and deceived by clouded is
sues !t will vote to put in office only clean
ar.d fconitt men; and
Whereae, H> misrepresentations and false
itporte our citizen* have been deceived and
misled so that only a \u25a0coalition between the
Republicans and the Dernocratf of San Fran
<-leco can hope to save the day for the cause
of Justice, -decency and honesty: therefore.
b? it
Resolved. For the welfare of San Francisco,
for tier sood namÂ«. and for her destiny, that
It is the sense of this caucus that the
municipal Republican party unite with the
municipal Democratic party in a fusion ticket
that will give the citizens who hold their
city's best interests ut heart an opportunity
tv unite for the redemption of San Francisco;
and be it further Â«
Resolved, That In order to carry out this
purjKÂ»se a committee of five be appointed by
the chair to confer with a like number to be
appointed by the delegates elected to the
Democratic local convention.
On motion of John D. Daly, the caucus
adjourned until this evening.
TO MEET POUR .VIGHTS.
â¢Alhambra Theater has been engaged for
four nights for the Republican conven
lion. The following official notice has
been mailed to every delegate:
"San Francisco, Sept. 12. 19%.
"Dear Sirâ The tielegates to the Repub
lican local convention elected at the prim
ary election on August S. 1&05, will meet

Committee. City and County of San
Francisco."
The organization committee of the San
Francisco Republican League will meet
at 4 o'clock this afternoon at headquar
ters, C 36 Market street, to consider sub
jects which may come before the. caucus
to-night.
The session of the committee at head
quarters yesterday at noon was decidedly
Sntere^ting. Harry Baehr and Daniel A.
Ryan had each strong supporters for the
Mayoralty nomination. Up to 1 o'clock
the impression was almost general that
the way would be cleared for Mr. Baehr's
Indorsement, but when it was found that
agreement was not possible, the name of
John S. Partridge was suggested.
The suggestion met with immediate fa
vor, and without much delay he was
made the unanimous choice of the com
mittee. , As he had boen previously se
lected for chairman of the local conven
tion the committee recommended that the
honor of presiding be accorded to Daniel
A. RyanÂ»
I'ntl! his name was mentioned Mr. Part
ridge had not the slightest intimation
that he would be called to the responsible
duties of leadership. He is a young man,
35 year? of age. being a year younger
than Mr. Pfcflan was .it the time of his
first nomination for Mayor. Mr. Part
ridge fs :i native son of California and a
praduate of the university of this State.
He was chairman of the Republican local
convention of 1903 and won much praise
for his ability as a speaker and his fair
ness and judgment as a presiding officer.
He is regarded as a man who represents
the highest type of citizenshipâ a clean,
honorable, industrious man of high char
acter and splendid ability.

BRITAIN TRYING
TO AVERT WAR
Brings. Pressure to Bear
Upon the Governments
of Sweden and Norway
Special Disratch to The Call.
LONDON. Sept. 12.â There is reason to
believe that the British Government is
actively endeavoring to prevent a rup
ture to-morrow between the Swedish and
Norwc-glan Commissioners at Karlstad.
These efforts for the present the
form of friendly counsel to both* sides to
exercise the utmost moderation at this
critical time, but the advice is coupled
with a firmer intimation that Britain
could not regard with equanimity* "a
forcible settlement of the northern ques
tion." "?-;.*â¢"-\u25a0 '\u25a0- --',: \.[
This means that Great Britain feels it
cou!d not afford to remain a passive ob
server of a war on - the Scan
dinavian peninsula, which would wreck
the power .and the prosperity /of
both belligerents, leaving them at the
mercy of their mighty and ambitious
neighbors to the east and the south.
The diplomatic pressure which the- Gov
ernment is bringing to bear at Stockholm
and Christiania to influence both sets of
negotiators is supplemented by timely ar
ticles by British military critics on the
"fortress incubus." These articles are
intended to convince the Swedes, on the
one hand, that they are cherishing a de
lusion if they think an invading army
cotiid successfully establish a base for
itself at Kongsvinger or Fredrikssteru
while on the other hand the Norwegians
are assured that it is folly to believe
fortifications erected at a cost of $750,000
coulu be of much avail In checking the
advance of a modern army.
STOCKHOLM, Sweden, Sept. 12.â The
delegates of Norway and Sweden appoint
ed to discuss the dissolution of the union
of the two countries wiir reassemble at
Karlstad to-morrow and. as it is, declared
here that the Swedish conditions, are un
akerable. the outcome seems to depend
on tht Norwegian acceptance Tof these
conditions. Th tone adopted by the Nor
wtgian newspapers this morning was very
threatening and was considered to be
specially significant, coming after yester
day's meeting' of the Norwegian delegates.
It is recognized that a breach may fol
lcw the reassembling of the delegates and
the Swedish authorities are preparing for
such an eventuality.
CHRISTIANIA, Norway, Sept, 12.â The
newspapers continue to somewhat heated
ly discuss Sweden's refusal to agree to
an arbitration treaty. The Morganbladet
says Norway is prepared to dismantle
her new fortifications in order to show
her love for peace and desire for a set
tlement with Sweden; but not a gun or
a Etone shall be moved until the arbitra
tion treaty is signed. . . .
MISSL\a 3IOTOEMAN
A STMKE BREAKER
NEW TORK, Sept. 12.â Detectives con
tinued to search the city during the
night for Paul Kelly, motorman of the
Ninth Avenue elevated train which
jumped the track yesterday at Fifty-third
street Junction and caused the death of
a dozen passengers in the second car and
severe Injuries to a large number. To all
appearances Kelly has made good his
escape. A story reached the police last
night that his sweetheart had managed
during the afternoon to draw Kelly's
money from a savings bank.
The motorman was a strike breaker
who entered the company's employ six
months ago. He came hejre from St.
Ixiuis.
According to some of the passengers
on the ill-fated train things went wrong
with the motorman from the . beginning
of Tils trip down town. At One Hundred
and Twenty-fifth street. It is said, he
started 1 the train with such a Jerk that
a woman carrying a baby was thrown
down the aisle of the first car and the
baby was hurt." Kelly came out of the
motor box to see whether she was badly
injured, and a number of men passengers
Epoke to him with some roughness, which
he resented. The passengers assert that
the train continued Its course down town
with- sudden stops and starts which
caused much alarm long before the acci
dent. Â»

R. H. Countryman \u25a0 in seconding the ;
resolution said it was one ; of '.the: most j
important documents ever, presented to a
Republican gathering Jn this : city. If j
the Republicans ; gaye I ;. up to the Demo- j
crats the. offices contemplated .' in the j
fusion plan they would also give up the .:
hope of carrying, San Francisco for, the j
Republican party in the ; next gubenia- . ;
toriaT election. \u0084 i
P. McGushin had a. resolution to intro
duce and before presenting it he said: '-'
BacK !n Kurope there are monarchs yam.
enough and crazy enough" to believe that they
rult by divine right. > I'd like to know by
what/d ivine right *lsht men of fhe Republi
can League rect-ive their credentials. It must
be. humiliating to cur Democratic friendsâ and
we all of us have Democratic friendsâit must
be humillatinsr to that old party that has
ruled the city so long and might ,rul* againâ
to bury Us destiny and sacrirtce its future on
the altar of srlte. â¢-
Mr. McGusnin's resolution was as fol
lows:
Whereas. It is apparent that the executive
committee of the San Francisco Republican
Leagu r is dominated by the Influences which
control the Citizens' Alliance, : and that to
serve the purposes 'of the Citizens' Alliance,
the eaia commltu-e" is willing to abandon : the
local Republican party and its organization to
the â¢organization' of the local Democratic
party wuich is dominated by. the same Influ
ence â under /the pretense of "fusion," and ,"_
Whereas, said executive committee is seek
ing to impose upon the deltgates . of the Re
publican local convention a candidate for
Mayor who will. If elected, carry out the ob-i
Jects and plans of the Citizens' Alliance as
against the wage workers and the plain I peo
ple of San Francisco, and \u25a0
Wh ereas. The nomination of such a candi
date would mean certain defeat for the Re
publican party, while his election would mean
disaster to the city and a retarding of its
prosperity for many years; therefore b? it \u25a0,
lte*olved. That we. a majority of tho dele
gates elected to said local Republican con
vention, do hereby pledge ourselves unalterably
agiin.-t the nomination of such a '"candidate
tor Mayor and against the proposed fusion
with the Democratic party.
KUEF SHOWS PLEASURE.
Chairman Morris asked if there were
any present who wished to speak,
and before -any loquacious and
aspiring spellbinder who did hot
understandâ if there ; were any in
such a gathering who do- not understand
â could turn loose, Daniel G. Coleman
moved that Abe Rucf be added to the
caucus and given the privilege- of- the
floor. The faithful ones inside the ropes
cheered valiantly and Ruef swept the
space with bows, undeniably pleased at
his prominence. He climbed to the plat
form and delivered a speech much the
same as others that have preceded it
during thi3 campaign. He roasted the
newspapers that opposed him and the
people that write for them, and declared
that he and his followers would organize
the Republican convention. He said in
part: â¢â¢ v.'
I know there are delegates of the Republican
League here, but they do not answer to th*>ir
namts. The reason is not hard to see. I knew
these delegates are hero, but under the fear of
abusive and blackmailing newspapers they ate
afraid to answer |to their names. .They, am
afraid of being abused for coming out and
giving their opinion? like free American citi
zens. The question will come whether this is
to be a government by the people or by th*
blackmailing newspapers. I am glad to say
that I am one Republican of this city who is
not afraid to arise and hurl defiance' at ihÂ«
corrupt and venal newspaper proprietors and
editors.
The Republican League is bound together by
a elimy cement manufactured by theee editors
that will dissolve when the moment of battle
Comes. I see around me . many . Republicans
who are afraid to get up and say that "which
would well from their hearts. , This means a
majority of the convention on September 19,
and If Indications are right It will bu a real
majority: 1 hear an Ã¼Ãieament has: been
reached by . the minorityâ -that is, -those- who
represent' fewer votes than the IGSâ or ' rather
by their- leaders, to give away the most Im
portant of Sees, virtually \u25a0'\u25a0 in \u25a0 exchange â¢\u25a0 ffa a.
gold . brick. I do not want to be understood
as supporting any other man than the one who
has been my friend through all â who has suf
fered unjust abuse- and vituperationâ but Mn
regard to all other matters I am as good a
Republican as liveÂ»*ln the State of California.
RESPECTABLE ELEMENT.
When you find that not a single corrupt poli
tician has been omitted' by the 'Republican
League In making up the district committees â
when you see these men creeping In under the
banner of reform to do their dirty work â then
It is time that you, the respectable element,
take hold and try to purify matters.
Ruef referred to the Citizens' Alliance
by saying that an effort was being made
to bind the city hand and foot to an
organization sworn to throttle labor. He
said that eight men "like the Chinatown
squad" ruled the league delegation. The
Flsk and Herrln or Wheelan and Herrin
combination had agreed that not one of
the delegations before him should" have
a county committeeman." ;.
In 'conclusion Ruef appealed to his
hearers to stand as a unit and 'brought
out- the only genuine applause during his
speech,, which nearly all | before him had
heard previously in some form or another,
by saying that If 16,000 Republicans, repre
sented by 231 . delegates, : could make a
fusion with 3000 Democrats, it was just
as easy for 16,500 to make a fusion with
25,000 Labor Union men. Tne remark was
taken as prophetic of the future action
of the Ruef "end. - ; ; - . '\u25a0â¢.-"
Countryman t,hen moved that a caucus
nominee for chairman of the convention
be chosen, and Coleman was selected.
He made a speech, saying he would- be
fair' to all if elected /and denounced the
Leaguers as scccders.
A resolution by D. Reilly'- that t^he dele
gates recommend a'man from each-dis
trict for Supervisor was adopted.

the setinion of the lecrlslatlve Insurance
investigating; committee. The fact naÂ»
drann from Kdmund D. Randolph,
treasurer of the Xew Yorlc Life, late
in the day, after Attorney Charles 12.
Hashes, of connnel to the committee,
bad' labored for more than an hour to
Set a direct answer from Randolph to
a direct queKtlon.
The inquiry dragged through a mass
Â£>l figures during almost the entire day.
.-^bi; t it was not until near the hour for
ending the session that the sensational
feature was brought. out. _ . -Z
t Earlier in the day Randolph had
handed Hughes a schedule of syndicate
underwritlngs and transactions of the
New York Life for the last ten years.
This statement was to show, and a
footnote to the schedule so stated, that
the company had participated in no
syndicate transactions that had been
closed out \u25a0with a loss. Among these
syndicate transactions \u25a0was the under
writing of the navigation syndicate, or
International Mercantile Marine.
THE $800,000 SALE.
' Hughes drew from the witness that
there was an aggregate of $4,000,000
fthe New York Life paid J. P. Morgan
& Co. on this "Joint account." Hughes
then took up a sale item dated Decem
ber 31, 1903, of JBOO.OOO of International
i Mercantile Marine stock. Randolph
replying to Hughes, said this sale was
made to J. P. Morgan &. Co., and that a
purchase of $Â£00,000 was made on Jan
uary 2, 1904, from J. P. Morgan & Co.
After failing for some time to get
a direct answer, Mr. Hughes finally
asked Randolph:
"As a matter of fact there was a re
port to the Superintendent of Insurance
on December 31. 1903?"
"Yes."
"Then tbe sole purpose of the trans
action -ii a* that you 'might be able to

Witness hesitated and tried to evade
a direct answer, but Hughes repeated
the question, until finally Randolph
â¢aid:
"Yes."
There was a momentary hush, fol
lowed by a murmur of suppressed ex
citement.
Following the navigation syndicate
transaction Mr. Hughes referred to an
item on the schedule of syndicate
transactions under date of December
30, 1904, by which $800,000 of bonds !
were sold to J. P. Morgan & Co." of ]
London -for $720,000. Randolph ad- j

rmitted that this was an outright sale,
I and the loss of $80,000 was charged
off to the profit, and loss account.
Hughes left the point and took up an
association known as "Nylic", with the
New York Life Insurance. Â» He got from
' the witness the admission that on April
111, 1904, a sale of $50,000 worth of
! stock to "Nylic" was made.
',-'_:, i COLLATERAL LOAA'S.
The usefulness of the New York Se
| curity and Trust Company to the New
York Life came out when it was testi
fied that while the insurance company
was not taking collateral loans, it
made a practice of lending its money
to the trust company, which made the
collateral loans.
Hughes took up the accounts of the
money deposited with the New York
Security and Trust Company in 1902,
which was called account No. 4. It
ran- from $6,750,000 in May and -June
up to $12,531,000 in September, \ and
ended -at well over $10,000,000 in- De
cember.
"Now," said Hughes, "why did you
reduce the amount deposited with the
New York Security and Trust Com
pany in July, 1904, to $2,500,000 and
keep it at that even figure to the end
of the year? Your balance "at the be
ginningof 1904 was $8,000,000?";
Randolph .professed Ignorance, the
impossibility, of remembering every
transaction and interrupted again and
again.. "', ';?\u25a0\u25a0+/â¢*>,
Hughes begged the witness to re
frain from "general conversation" and
repeated the question.
Randolph finally, said:, *->\u25a0 '
"There was a question at this time
whether our relations would continue
with the company. The consolidation
of the New York Security and Trust
Company was taking place at this
time."
"Now, prior to the end of 1901, the
trustees of the New York, Security and
Trust Company held 5005 shares, that
is, a majority of the 10,000 shares?" ...
"Yes."
"Well, in March, 1904, when the. total
stock of the company was increased
J to 30,000 shares, were the holdings .'of
the trustees increased?"
FRENZIED FINANCE. |
Witness was then - led through the
change of the name \u25a0of " the trust," com- '
pany and admitted that three accounts
with the old, company were : closed , and
four opened with the" new /one. When
the money was withdrawn from the New
York Security and Trust Company it, was
deposited with the First National Bank.
This admission r was elicited from the
witness after much pressure.
In reply as to Interest paid by the
j various banks where the insurance com
pany had deposits, Randolph said all 1 of
the banks paid 2 per cent, except the
Bank of Montreal, which paid 2& per
cent In > discussing the syndicate' to
handle the New Â£>rleans Railroad securi
ties,; which transaction was closed'out in
1904, Randolph referred to. a receivership
being -' appointed, which , was unforeseen
by the New, York Life, when the securi
ties, were taken up. Witness also- said
that some, parties In the company had
expected to Join In. handling the securi
ties,* but "failed to do so, but when asked
the names; refused , to giv c , them.
This closed ;the inquiry, but Assembly
man Rogers, who was in the chair, said
to'the witness before adjourning : the
sitting:
. . "Some , of; the ; committee are â¢ not > satis
fied with your refusing to give the names
of those who participated In the Joint
profit deals." . Sh@SBBSBHH<
.. "In \u25a0/ answer.; I would say, 1 ' answered
Randolph,^ "that it is an ; entirely rconfl-'r confl-'
dential . matter;/. there was > ho intimation
;on the^part , of anybody .: .'of bad; faith."
After adjournment; Hughes .said the ex

'be continued - to-morrow.' '\u25a0.< \u25a0 ::, *." V

tifled Friday that j when the time had
come to remove the stock from its assets,
it was turned 1 over to the "New: York
Trust â¢ Company as collateral for a loan,
for' which' notes ~were given- by; George
Marshall, the colored messenger employed
in the - office of the company ; at - $600 a
year. The'trust company was owned by
officials of the insurance company. .
Hughes endeavored to r ascertain "who
authorized the transaction. Randolph was
asked to point out in' the finance com
mittee of the New York Life Company the
record'of the sale of the stock. The com
pany had no record o( any "dummy"
notes given by Marshall or -any 'otner
messenger employed -by, the company. 3
Randolph declared : â¢ "It is a recognized
custpm in financial concerns to have dum-*
my bonds: I am sorry the name of George
Marshall has been ' brought \ into ridicule.
On this transaction ; we â¢ carried it . along
for the- company and made an additional

There > was imminent danger,; in \ his '. opin
ion, of a general strike among the miners
in the anthracite coal , region?- of Penn

cipation of the Jews In Russia and their par
ticipation ;ln the government "of the empire
in the same degree and proportion that other
Russian subjects are allowed to participate.
Mr. de Witte made no pledges: he spoke for
himself as an indlridual. but it is well known
that,; while not in power; now. he will ba
soon. ;. The Jews In Russia will again enjoy
civil rights. Discrimination prejudicial to the
Jews, .the injustice of which Mr. de Witte ad
mits freely, will be ended, and they will be
placed on an equal footing with the rest of
the Emperor's subjects.

President Says the Russians Won
Great Diplomatic Victory.
PARIS, Sept. 12.â The Petit Pa
risienne will publish to-morrow a strik
ing interview with President Roose
velt, who gave its correspondent an
audienec at Sagamore HIIL
I "If I felt forced to make peace," said
the President, "it was simply in tha
cause of humanity. I remembered the
battle . of \ Santiago, In which I fought.
I remembered the horror and sadness of
war, and I: said to myself,. 'It must
end.' "
The correspondent hinted that \ the
President's Influence had chiefly
brought about the. abandonment of the
Japanese" demands for a war indemnity,
to which President Roosevelt replied:
v "That may be true, but ~ the diplo
matic, victory must rest with De! Witte.*
It iwould never.; have been * so : great a
victory had the Japanese realized more
quickly that' Russia never ; intended ; to
pay war indemnity. 1 I knew this and
repeated it many times to the Japanese
envoys. 'If you were at Moscow,' I
said "'indemnity would be a matter of
course, but you are not.' Supposing, af
ter; another year's struggle, you take
Siberia?..' It' will 'cost you threes or four
hundred thousand men ; and millions of
dollars, and, when you have it. 1 It would
be only a white* elephant with which
you would not know what to do.. You
had much better "give in on these
points.' But ; they remained obdurate,
in the hope that De Wltte would weak
en. When I did , not believe success
possible they relented." ~X*~' '\u25a0* 1

How Is M
Your Heart?
Is your pulse weak, too slow,
too fast, or does it skip a beat?
Do you have shortness of
breath, weak or hungry spells,
fainting, smothering or choking
spells, palpitation, fluttering,
pains around the heart, in side
and shoulder ; or hurt when
lying on left side?
If "you have any w of these
symptoms your heart is weak
or diseased, and cannot get
better '--without assistance.
Dr. Miles' Heart Cure
strengthens weak hearts, and
rarely ever ; fails to cure heart
disease. Try it, and see how
quickly you will find relief.
"About January Ist. 1902. I too*
down with weakness and dlropsy.
and gradually ffrew worse. I was told
by my family physician that my case
was hopeless. My neighbors and fam-
ily had given me up- to die. My "
limbs and body were swollen to one- .
third larger than normal size.' and
water had collected around my heart.
For at least three months I had to sit
propped up in bed to keep from smoth-
ering. â¢ I , sent for five bottles of - Dr.
Miles" Heart Cure, * and by the time I .<\u25a0
, had taken them all I was â¢ entirely
"' cured. â¢ I feel better than I have for \u25a0
twenty years, and I am able >to do .
any kind of work on mjr farm. -My
' ; attending, physician told <me that if It
hadn't been for Dr. Miles* Heart CurÂ«
I would now be in my rrave."

The five best reasons I know
of why Buck's - Stoves ; and
Ranges are superior to all oth-
ers are as follows : â¢ y
Istâ Every Buck Ranee will
burn either. wood or coal, .one-
; side of the grate being for wood
and the otheri for coal, makine
it convenient for: a- family who
wishes to ? get' a : quick 1 meal -
without . making a bie. fire.r or
for localities where wood j is
used in place of coal. >-
2dâ That every ; Buck Ranee
or Stove has a ventilated oven. \u25a0
. thereby enabling one to . cook
pastry almost immediately after
taking out a roast. :
3dâ That . every -. Buck Ranee
'\u25a0\u25a0 or ' Stove has - 1 " a white enamel '
â¢ door, which . reflects the i heat, \u25a0
enabling one .to cook . a \ large-;
roast .without; turning.;,: - .
j 4th-â That i every Buck '\u25a0, Range
or Stove has a hot blast firebox.

At I a meeting ; of the railway . officials
there was little discussion as to ,what.the
action of the railroads should be. .The

before adjournment the officials of ; the

deal individually with any committee of
the freight handlers. -
The railroad officials are .going ahead
with preparations for a strike. Cots are
being hauled to the freight houses and
hundreds of men have been tentatively
hired to take ;the places of the union
men should they vote to; strike. Chief
of Police Collins has been communicated
with and he will supply police protection
to the freight houses.
The agreement, which expired last June
and which the ' : union" is seeking to re

the Trial.
SACRAMENTO, Sept 12.â The. arrival
of. Jcseph Jordan ' from Tonopah ,at an !
earlyrhour this morning gladdened the!
prosecution in. the case of E. J. Emmons,*
on trial ' before Superior Judge Hartr t for.
bribery. Jordan came In onithe overland
m the best of health and wearing | the
tan of the Nevada mining camp." But his
mind is â¢ not at '\u25a0 ease. If goes
against him to testify against the men
who were associated with him. in the
great crime of the ' last session of ! the
Legislature. ' But J he has come back to
give his testimony in answer |to the ; dic
tates of the first law of natureâself-pro
tection. \\u25a0: '
- "I ; did I not want to coma | baqk." he eaid,
."but circumstances compelled me. I must live,
and to live I must work.'. -.My 'employers gave
their pledge to District Attorney Seymour thai'
I would be back to testify, this in return for
his permission that I be permitted to leave the
Stata. Something / within- me? called upon me
not : to g-iva testimony; against the men under
indictment for bribery, ' but I had to i look out
tor my' family and myself.*.^ The result Is that
I am back. \u25a0 It is my purpose to tell the whole
truth and nothing but ime truth, -a* 1 \u25a0 have
done since thÂ© day I told all to the Senate in
vestigating committee. I shall go to San Fran
cisco this afternoon at- 3: 40 o'clockto confer
with my â¢\u25a0 employers regarding some " business.
But- 1 will be back within a day or so. lam
sorry they. * this - case \u25a0 is bo long drawn oul
The whole affair is bitter enough to be short,
but' the | ways of the i law are slow and therÂ«
are three men that remain to be tried. How
ever, I must be patient, hoping that my ordeal
will be over by. the end of the year." I .
Eleven jurors were selected to-day ,to
try the case, the selection of veniremen
being, unusually fortunate. A
of the men called to serve were taken
from 'Channels having ,no -connection
whatever with the legislative scandal,
with the. result tnat a majority of the
talesmen called were acceptable to both
sides. I The work of completing the jury
will be taken up at 10 o'clock to-morrow
morning, and it is believed 'that within
half an'; hour- the first witness will be
called by the prosecution. Those who
have been selected to try Emmons are:
G. W. Stocking, freight handler; P. H.
Hanrahan, lumbfr handler; F. J. Gieseke,
contracting plasterer; A. Johnson, retired
contracting- carpenter; Felix Sermonet,
grocer; Louis J. Weil,- merchant; A.
Popert. grocer; ( J. -Kromer, tailor; A.
Macy, carpenter; "W. H^Sherburn, auc
tioneer, and A. Dittmar, uhpolsterer. â¢ "
The first clash of the Emmons trial
came this morning during the examina
tion of veniremen. Grove L. Johnson,
for the defense, was probing around to
determine the state of mind of the men
under examination, when he asked this
question:
, â¢-â¢ W<>uld you convict a Senator charged
with*bribery~ because the District Attor
ney sought to impress you that it was
your duty to convict these men just as
an example to evil-doers and to legislators
in particular?" . .
\u25a0'Toa.would be Insulted, would. you not,"
interjected the ' District Attorney, "if any
such appeal were made to you and you
were _ asked to condemn a man solely to
frighten -all criminals?"
-"Well, that's what you, did In the Bunk
ei3 case," retorted Johnson, "and you are
goinp to do it in this."
"That is not true," roared Seymour,
"and youâ "
"Go on with the examination;" com
manded Judge Hart. V "This hearing must
not ..be delayed, by. bickering." The at
torneys obeyed. . , '".;- :
" District Attorney Seymour ' gave the
first Intimation this 'morning: that he in
tends \u25a0to call convict Bunkers to the
stand. This was evidenced by his ques
tions .to-, the ". veniremen, â¢ asking them if
they. would give full* consideration to the
testimony, ot. accomplices- that would be
called^in the trial. .There was some ques
tion'; 1 as to -whether Bunkers would be
called,; but, these questions seem to dls- \
pose of all ; doubt -\u25a0". .â¢'*\u25a0":." .'" - -\
.When; the case was called this morning
the prosecution - challenged Venlreman
W. J. j Hogan and; the Â£ defense dismissed
George , Middlemas and John ; Duflfy. .
"During 'the afternoon . sessloii nine ven-.
iremen were excused* from service for va
rious reasons." Simon Ash, John E. But
ler and > A.,A. > Turpl'e were "challenged by
the defense for cause," consisting of unal
terable opinions as : to the guilt" or Inno
cence ;of the defendant, ( they did not say

tragedy at Granite Hill camp, near here,
last TfcurÂ«day is developing into the most \u25a0\u25a0
perplexing as well as horrible crime ever
committed In this section of Oregon. Since
old man Jennings, the miner, was found
dead In his cabm with a bullet hole" in
his head the Coroner and officers- have
made s. thorough investigation and have
fixed the crime upon members of the
family. Sheriff Lewis and Deputy Lister
left this morning to make arrests. -
It Is no longer believed that the old
man killed himself. It is now positively
known that he was murdered, and the
mysterious feature of the crime Is the
fact that It was committed while â¢ Jen
nings' four children were in the - house;
in truth, the oldest daughter, aged 18
years, occupied a bed in the room In
which the murder was done and but a
few feet from that in which her father
slept.
- either the daughter, her younger" sister,
or the two boys appear to know any
thing about the, crime. They say they
heard absolutely no noise during the night
âno shot, no groans, nothing that would
give indication of trouble. Yet a shot
was fired, and the upturned condition of
the beddothing proves the murdered man
must have made a struggle.
Another feature of the case that adds
to the likelihood of the oldest daughter
knowing something of the crime was
the finding of a revolver on the shelf
over her bed. One shot had been fired
end the bullet in the pillow is of the
same caliber as the pistol. The weapon
has finger marks on itâ bloodstained fin
der marksâ proving further that it was
the weapon from which the fatal shot
was fired.

OAKLAND. Sept. 12. â The Immigra
tion problem was the subject of an ad
dress this evening by Representative J.
R. Knowland before the Men's League
of the First Congregational Church, the
occasion being the monthly supper of
the league, at which Representative
Knowland was the guest of honor. The
Congressman was warmly welcomed in
an introduction by Harry Benner. presi
dent of the league. In opening his ad
dress Representative .Knowland said
that the active life of business and pro
fessional men in their private ; affairs
had left few of them free to study
great questions of state now before the
American people. Of these he declared
the problem of the restriction of for
eign immigration to be not the l^st
important. He quoted that during, the
month of April of this year 137.094 im
migrants entered the various ports of
the United States.

SORORITY GIRLS
IN DEEP GRIEF
Result of the -Pan-Hellenic
Agreement Is Distressing
to the University 3laidens
BERKELEY, Sept. 12.â There is grief,
wailing and lamentation to-day in the
sororities of the University of California
as the result of the new agreement which
the sororities entered into, at the begin
ning of the term In regard "to the matter
of "rushing" the . freshmen , **co-eds." 1.5'1 .5 '-
"When the answers of the freshmen "co
eds" who had been] lnvited- to join? the
various sororities of the - university were
opened to-day it was found i that . two
sororities, the Kappa Kappa Gamma and
the Kappa Alpha Theta, j had secured
practically a monopoly of the most promi*
neut â¢ women students, and the other
sororities, which bad hoped to get their
share of 4be invaluable new material; for
membership, had been treated | even as
the proverbial deuce in the deckâ they
were overlooked.
Ordinarily these freshmen ' women, who
are regarded as the most desirable ma
terial for membership in the . exclusive
sororities, are pretty evenly divided
among the sororities. .Tlie. monopoly
which the Kappa Kappa Gamma and the
Kappa Alpha Theta societies have now
secured Is regarded as a direct result
of the pan-Hellenic agreement entered
Into between all the sororities at the
opening of the college as ' to "rushing 1 :
freehmen women students. and. ; so the
pan-Hellenic agreement la being cursed
to-day with feminine' curses high and
daintily shrill. -
Hitherto the sororities have always en
gaged In a ruinous competition at the be^
ginning of college to secure the talented,
rich and otherwise most desirable fresh
men girls for their societies. Costly en
tertainments, have been given to the
young women desired, lots of money, has
been spent in other ways and the wear
and tear on the sorority personnel has
been "something terrible."
Wise, thoughtful girls proposed last
summer that all this competition be done
away .with and that 'no arguments be
used to entice , promising "co
eds" into the sororities. \u25a0;.* Each * sorority
was to stand on its, merits, invite fresh
men girls to its quarters, show the beau
ties of sorority life, but refrain from oral
arguments, " "knocking" or any sort .of
persuasion. , , ... .; .
; The humbler sororities and the richer,
more fashionable- societies all entered into
the agreement. . It has now developed, as
a resell, that the- fashionable sororities
have captured practically all the plums.
The formal invitations ; to the freshmen
girls who were most desired by all the
sororities have produced answers, opened
to-day, favorable to the bids of the
Kappa Kappa Gamma- and the. Kappa
Alpha Theta, richest and most exclusive
of the sororities. - - - \u25a0 - -.;<- : . ..-', '.' '\u25a0'.- 3
The freshmen girls, dazziedy by the
splendor of \u25a0 tbe appointments In . these
two sororities, have v . succumbed, ;; not
counting the cost, perhaps, as the. other
sororities say.- but falling easiJy into the
net of the two sororities in question. *
It is because of . this that the pan-
Hellenic agreement is being cursed, in a
feminine way, with : the prospect <\u25a0 of . its
rejection by ' the" disgruntled^' sororities
almost certain - when next year cornea.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Sept. li-
The Stanford Sequoia, the literary maga
zine 1 of -the university, appeared for sale
yesterday/on the. VQtiad."- The issue con
tains among its articles 'a" 'treatise on the
athletic ' problem of \u25a0 the , university, i The
article is by Professor Colbert 'Searles and
is entitled "Athletics and Hero Worship."
; "This , article* contains .* statistics on the
numbtr. of students who are "flunked" out
of college .and "also the number who were
engaged: in \u25a0 any . branch' of university ath
letics. ;. The figures : . give college athletics
al black eye,*, but according to the author,
it is not altogether, the â¢ athletic work
.which has , been detrimental to the* acad
emic standing; but tne "Worship."
By this phrase Professor Searles means
that j the enthusiasm of the" students after
the athletic work is over interferes with
the r studies of the - athletes. ' This is the
cause i of " the deficiencies and this must
therefore be the point at which the rem
edy must b* applied. , The author is of
the opinion ' that . if after the" football,
baseball or any "other branch of athletic
practice is -over,' thÂ«" student was allowed
to study instead "of being ? interrupted by
classmates "who being overwhelmed by
their worship of the hero flock to the ath
letic . comrade aad take hi* time by dis
cussing various situations in the athletic
trend of affairs,' he would not find It dif
ficult to keep up In his studies. *
Professor. Searles is a member of_ the
faculty committee on student athletic af
fairs and his solution. of the problem is
therefore doubly interesting.'

STANFORD UNIVEKSITY. Sept. IXâ
The annual "nlgiit-govri" parade of let
traditions of the Stanford University vu
held last night upon the campus and was
participated in by 400 ttndents mainly
from Encina Hall. . The exarch was bÂ» -
gun at 19 o'clock, and before. the students
returned to the- donaltory, they had pal 4
a 'visit .-.to every fraternity house ; and
dornoltory of the cnireraity.
The parade Is a. function, unique, 'and
having iL3 cri^ion at Stanford. It con
rists of a lctk step a^^ serpentine march
beginning on the upper floor of'-th*
dormitory, and traversins the haCs of
the bdldlng until' the formation Is com<
pletett and then Journeying to the girls*
dormitory, Roble HalL At this point the
entire number' of - "gawners"* engaged la
fantastic dances and sung college songs
for the benefit of the fair eo-eda who ad
miringly crowded to. the windows to ap
plaud the serenaders.
After the visit was completed at Robl*
the throng wended its way. to the "Bow,*
the homes of the faculty and fraternities,
where another serenade was forced upon
the Inmates of the houses. At many of
the dwellings the visit consisted of mere
ly tramping up one side â¢of the veranda
and down the other. At several of , thÂ»
*frats," however. - the entire crowd of
shouting and singing students were ih
vlted to enter and sins their songs. This
Invitation was In every Instance accepted
and as the foremost men crossed the
thresholds the word was invariably passed
along, "scrape your feet" and leneei
down."
The garb worn on this auspicious oeea-.'
slon Is either a suit of pajamas, a &rtaÂ»'\
ins gown or a ni^ht robe of any deserts?
tion flipped over the student's "other
clothes and. surmounted with, .a wblta
head covering of any son. usually a
towel or a white bag. The more, ridic
ulous the costumes the better ; it
suits the occasion. The parade of
last night arose from the .en-;
thusiasm aroused ty the fart that \u25a0 the
first football practice of the season was'
engaged In earlier In the day. *^

DRINK AND PUBLIC OWNERSHIP.
A T the recent meeting of the municipal officers of cities in this
Z\ country, held at Toledo, Ohio, public ownership of public
*\u25a0 *â¢ utilities was discussed. That policy was advocated by Mayor
Dunne of Chicago, and was opposed by Mayor Woodward of At
lanta, Ga. Now Mayor Woodward is given to conviviality. The
* cljnk of the cannikin is music unto his ear. He looks upon the
wine when it is red and giveth the color in the cup. He also looks
â¢ upon other red liquor, frequently and favorably.
During the debate on public ownership he was drunk and saw
things through a glass, darkly. The proponents of public owner
ship were wildly gleeful over his condition, and its opponents did
not care to train behind a leader so uncertain and filled- with liquid
joy, so that side went by default. Before the Mayor left town he
was so full that he lost his money and his way, and had to have his
head soaked and put in repair. This is not the first time that thirst
has led him astray, and yet it is said that he is, when not outside
his cups, a good man, honest and upright, and Atlanta has borne
with him for what he is when sober. It was a grievous fault that
he got blear-eyed and fitful in his perpendicular while away from
home and officially representing his city, and his town feels duly
humiliated.
Mayor Dunne preened his sober feathers after his victory over
the whisky contained in the Mayor of Atlanta, and some advqeates
of public ownership have seemed to think that their cause is estab
lished and cannot be resisted any more, because a drunken man at
tacked it. The Examiner evidently takes this view, and out of the
surplus of its own virtues tears oft a large piece and identifies the
cause to whose defense the Ma}*or of -Atlanta staggered with his
condition when he went to bat. It makes no difference to that
newspaper champion that a drunken Mayor may be after all an hon
est man, the victim of an unfortunate infirmity. If he had been a
sober, alert and scheming grafter and an advocate of municipal
Ownership, his performance would have been headlined and her
alded in the same columns where he is now condemned.
Principles neither gain nor lose by the temporary condition of
those who advocate or oppose them. Municipal ownership is not
established as a right policy and principle because its advocate at
Toledo was cold sober and its opponent nearly* dead drunk. All
that is established by the Examiner's statement is its own lack of
logic. Municipal ownership is favored by municipal officers, who
graft and steal, who have under their official protection the vices anrl
infamies that go with the crowded life of a great city. It is favored
by such officials as promote and excite riot and public disorder
and. having the power, make the police idle witnesses of crimes
which the taxpayers pay them to prevent and to punish. It is
used as a vote-getting plank in platforms by the scheming and sin
ister scoundrels who lurk in the shadow of official power, ready to*
steal everything from the ooze of a garbage can to- the contents
oi the city treasury. It is advocated by ballot-box stuffers even
'after they wear prison stripes, and by boodlers who brazen through
trials for bribery. It is the dream of municipal robbers and politi
cal junk men, who know that 'their dishonest opportunity is en
larged by expansion of the area of governmental control.
The Examiner stands in the midst of this motley crowd of
the dishonest and dishonorable, advocating public, ownership and
feeling no taint from the contact. But wise men will neither con
demn nor approve a principle because of the moral quality, of its
advocates or opponents. Public ownership neither gained nor lost
anything at Toledo because the Mayor of Chicago -was sober and
the Mayor of Atlanta was drunk. It is the introduction ofj'socia!
ism into government. If the principle of socialism is right, if it be
"workable and better for mankind than our system of representative
government, then it will finally come, whether its advocates get
drunk as Bacchus or are sober as Father Mathew. Its entering
wedge will be public ownership and. operation of public utilities.
From that start it will proceed to grasp every resource of produc
tion and distribution. Its motto, ''Everything is everybody's," will
be enforced by the expropriation of private property, and the am
bition to earn something in order to own something will have no.
motive and will disappear. Not until then will it be possible to
weigh and estimate the effect of socialism upon man.
The present system is called competitive. Whatever it is it is
4iie product of the sense of self-interest and self-preservation. It
seems to find its illustration not in man alone, for it is seen through
out the physical universe. The strong tree does not halt in its
growth for the weak to catch up. The rose does not hold back its'
* Moom because the mullein cannot equal it. Nor does the strong
brute among the animals wait and disuse its power in favor of the
weak. If evolution is a science, socialism is a fad, no matter who
drinks whisky or who drinks water.
THE BOARD. OF WORKS DECISION.
THE Supreme Court' decides that members of the Boarci of
Works of this city are personally responsible in damages for
injury arising in the \u25a0 condition of the streets arid sidewalks.
It is a sweeping decision and probably applies to the elective Board
of Works in Oakland as well as to the appointive board here. It
strongly enforces official responsibility and makes membership of
the Board of Works desirable only for men who intend to work at
it and do their duty.
The decision seems to make it necessary that the board shall
know of dangerous . defects in the streets or sidewalks, in order to
be responsible, but it also makes it the business of the board to
know, which involves a system of inspection and report. Hereto
fore the city itself has been held responsible in damages in such
cases. But the court takes the proper view that the city employs
high salaried officers to protect it by their vigilance. If they are
neglectful they must stand the consequences and pay' for their neg
lect. They cannot put in their time doing politics, running a sa
loon or stuffing ballot-boxes.- They must do the work for which
they are paid. The crying need of the time throughout officialdom
in this country is for personal official responsibility. Given that
and graft and politics in office will be less rampant: â¢
â¢ In the case of the Board 6? Works responsibility may usefully
go farther than its members. It should project to the Mayor who
appoints them, and is charged by his oath to see that they do their
duty. To every personal suit brought against these for neglect of
duty* the Mayor should be made t a party defendant.- This would
carry all responsibility to the source of public authority, where it
belongs. Then if the Mayor promote a riot of newsboys causing
the injury of person and property, he can be instantly hauled* into
court to respond in whatever damage he has caused. : *

Brave Philadelphia Girl Sucks Venom
From Rattler's Bite and Saves
Life of a Young Man.
HEROINE AND YOUNG MAX \VHOSE LIFE SHE SAVED.
FROM Porter's Lake, â¢ Pike County,
comes the story. of an odd social,
which was held in the Porter's
Lake, Hunting and Fishing Club,, house
for the purpose of making public ac
knowledgment of the bravery of Miss
Lucy K. Ernst, a daughter of. Mr. and
Mrs. Bernard Ernst of this city, says
the Philadelphia North American.
. The social was given last Sunday by
Mr. and Mrs. A. Schoenhut, also of Phila
delphia. Miss Ernst recently saved the
life of their son, Harry E. Schoenhut.
With a jiarty. of other young men and
women belonging to the club, theÃe two
were in a grove near the club housel
Schoenhut felled a birch tree. > "
He stocked down to' cut a piece from
it with his pocketknife, when a rattle
snake struck him on the right arm,
above the elbow.
Miss Ernst was the only one of. the
party who retained her presence, of
mind. Quick as a flash she caught up
the pocketknife and cut the ' sleeve
from Schoenhut's. coat. â¢ Then she cut
out the flesh where the snake's fangs
had entered, and applying her mouth
to the arm, sucked out the venom.
This is the only sure antidote for the

specialty of modeling animals.'
"Every one has an idea that' elephants
become tame and even fond of people,
but this is altogether wrong. They are
easily trained, but are 'never" tarried.
They are docile just so long as the
keeper has his goad in his hand or

had proof of this one day while model

with any modeling stand, not . knowing
that on certain days he was given an
extra allowance of chain. . Suddenly, he
flung his trunk around with such force
that it smashed the stand' to bits' and
sent me a dozen feet outside the, stall.
"He never forgot his failure to finish
me, and soon afterward ;he expressed
his dislike in- a more vulgar if less

bite of. a rattlesnake, but it is also very
dangerous to. the one who applies: tne
treatment, for if the person .who sucks
the wound has a broken tooth or the
slightest abrasion in the mouth or lips,
the chances are nine out of ten that the
life of the person who has been bitten
will be saved at th'e'expe'nse of the life
of the person who sucked the wound.
Miss Ernst's act was particularly he
roic for the I reason that she had a
slight cut on her lip at the time, but the
fates . .seemed to protect her, arid . she
suffered no ill effects from the -poison.
Schoenhut did not have the least trou

arm has now healed perfectly. " . \u25a0
Invitations to the social were written
on birch bark, rolled up and tied with
ribbon. .
Schoenhut's father made a' formal ad
dress of thanks to Miss Ernst' and pre
sented her with a gold locket and chain.
The locket was set with seven dia
monds, and on the inside was a gold
medal bearing the following inscrip
tion: 1
"Presented to Lucy E. Ernst -by the
parents of Harry E. Schoenhut for her
heroism and bravery at Porter Lake

This sculptor and ; other .artists agree
that the cat animals-, have a different
mode of- attack. There seems less of
spite and more of real hate in their
method. Sculptors usually place their
modeling stands as close to the bars
as possible. This same one was once
working close to a tiger's cage, with
the beast insidft lying very "quiet, ap
parently asleep. 1 ; 1 Without even raising
his eyelids the big cat struck between
the bars with his heavy \ forepaw,
splintering the stand and sending the
clay in wads on the floor. The artist,

those who are much about animals, had

Stillâ well/ won't' you tell my wife?" .
"Certainly not."
"Nor anybody so's it will git to her?"
."You may be' sure that I will not."
"Well, then." I'll resk : it. When I
married" your aunt Naomer she V was
one of these tender, gen tle^ affectionate,
sweet young icreechers, and I didn't use
to .think them was half adjectives
enough to' fit her case^ And clingln' 1 .
I don't s'pose ; they ever was. anything
clingin'er. The habits of a vine is cold
an', distant in^ comparison. I -used to
s'pose I'd x have to keep her in a hot
house of affection. Well, I built the
hothouse,- but I've been.usin' it consid
er'blefer, a refrigerator, sence then. I
yit reckernize that : she's clingin', but
she sort o' overdoes it at times. ' .
"First time I noticed, that she was
more clingin' even than I'd s'pected
must have \u25a0been 'bout three or four
months after '\ we was married. I said
I'd got to go downtown to see a man,
and s,he doubted, my word, which is
hard fer. any man to stand. : Still, I
hadn't learned to lie graceful and
skillful at that time, bein' new. to mar
ried bliss, and I reckon I kind o' give
myself- away. Anyway, the plot thick
ened, ,and she took to clingin'. .The
place she | s'lected fer. her. clingin'
operations was my. hair, and seems to
me that. l feel It yit. ; The brief >and
beautiful treatise that you wanted to
spring on me says that women has
clingin' natures. Fur as my experience
goes, they certainlyhave. It also says
that they are gentle and.tender. So's a*
leopard yellerâ between its spots, but
they's considerablemany spots. .
."Sence I stayed to home that time
I've freely admitted that women is
nacherly .clingin', but when I come.' to
beautiful passages 'bout It in book 3
and papers I skip them. I'm willin'
to resk my experience to tell me all
'bout it. -They ain't no firmer adherent
of the doctrine than I am, but my feel
in's'onthe subjec' is. too deep to stand
much "advertisin*. . S'pose T'll have to
go now, fer your Aunt Naomer said I'd
better .hurry, and 313 1 \u25a0 have an inklin"
that she was right."
Old man Polycarp walked some dis-^

"Rigoletto" Charms
Big Audience
at Tivoli.
"Kigoletto." the opera that Introduced
Pol&cco to San Francisco and in which
we discovered Tetrazzini, was given last j
night for the second of the season's
operas} " Politely Signor Polacco was i
hailed by the audience. The overture, j
brightly read, got a lively hand. Signor j
Bazelli, who makes love as beautifully as
Mr. TVhittlesey. was warmly greeted.
Signor Gregorettl was welcomed as
should be the best Figaro ever heard
here. Dado, the magnificent, in magnifi
cent trim, bowed to a handsome ealvo.
But the audience, less by a cold thou- '
sand than wanted to get into the Tivoli
"ast night, still waited. Even after the
stunning climax of the first scene. In
which Signor Polacco simply let things
loose into a shout of Joy, the audience
-.eserved it* final hand. It was waiting
for the little Tetrazzini, the home-made
prirna donna, the willful, electric little
person who brought the star system to
the Tivoli. and put up a Lucia under
Melba's very nose last season.
The pause after the first scene may
have been accident, may not. Accident
or not. It was distinctly dramatic
Some of the timid brethren were be
ginning to wonder how long It would
take to get their money back at the
box-ofSce. For never before did Rigo
lettos garden take so long to set. At
least two of Mr. Conried's long dis
nnee injunctions were suspected. Fear
i^zzed about the house, an impatient
i.and or two clapped at the ominous
curtain, and then Signor Polacco ap
peared.
It was not to say that Mr. Conried
had corralled our song-bird, nor to say
that the song-bird had a throat. It was
to take up the baton he came, and the
audience leaned back to its sigh of re
lief, v- '\u25a0:: ::
Good, good work from Gregoretti,
two years more of an artist than he
w-as when last here, in noble voice, and
then came the lady. One wondered, a
little fearfully, if the voice could be so
beautiful as one remembered it. Was
it? One waited breathlessly.
The house rained a discreet applause,
but in the face of the discipline of the
conductor did not dare to interrupt the
progress of the opera. Bowing, smiling
tJenan^e at a thousand Conrieds and in
junctions and things. Tetrazzini stood
there, modestly keeping the picture.
Then came the first crystalline note.
pure as a pearl, and the Tetrazzini spell
was about us again. The voice Is all
on* remembers it, dazzlingly pure, per
fectly flexible, fresh as the morning. It
is In marvelous trim, not a thread of a
thought of fatigue being suggested.
Weaving In and about the barytone it
wfnt â in a delicious bit of ensemble
â and then came Tetrazzini's
chance to take the welcome the house
was there to give. . â¢
All the noise that every pair of hands
there could make was made, and the lit
tle woman stood there smiling at It. She
looked over at the near few of us a good
American triumph over silly things like
injunctions, and then walked up stage to
pive an absurd, delightful little giggle at
her triumph.
And the wine of ft was in the love
<h:<?t that came next. Bazelli. the Duke
sar.g like one possessed, ardor incarnate.
After this, the "Caro Nome." Then one
forgot everything but that here was one
of the beautiful voices of the world, and
an artist sheerly lovely. So. too. does
Tetrazzini here forget. The aria was, of
t curse, repeated, and sung again with the
same triumphant, brilliant freshness.
Kven bettor than the Tetrazzini of the
first "Rigoletto" she seemed, and at least
here the season again triumphs.
Gregorettis best part Is n.<n Rigo
letto, but he is a notable singer any
where. The sea .son is remarkable In
its barytones. Signor Moreo" on Mon
day night showed himself a-consum
mate artist. If Sigrnor Salassa is In the
fine form one hears there . is an artist
possibly the finest ever heard at the
Tivoli. And Gregoretti, - Gregoretti
*vho in some things yields none to Sa
lassa, and in some otners does what
f?alaÂ«>a cannot do. He has gained.fine
n^ss and breadth In the two years of
his absence, and his voice has gained
fl*pth. I have heard him happier in his
ringing than last night, but heard him
only in the earlier Â«part of his work.
Dado, again, in the little part of
Monterone. counted heavily. His big,
beautiful voice is rounder than ever]
thundering out in th- most satisfying
fashion. Gravlna as Sparafuclle again
showed himself an artist.
Perhaps BazelH's Duke was not I
Caruso's, but It was a quite dashing,
ardent affair nevertheless. The voice

It was about as long a drop from
"Caro Nomei" to "The Pit," over at the
Columbia, as could -. well have been
taken.- I found there Mr. Channirig
Pollock s dramatization of "The Pit" at
the close of its second act and was
plunged right into the heart of the
romance of American business.
For almost three years the play has
been running, its opening marking the
making of a new star, Wilton Lackaye.
beforetlme the best character actor on
the American stage. There has always
seemed adequate reason for ' making a
star of Mr. Lackaye. They could do no
other, It would seem, when the want of
a Curtis Jadwln came to. be felt. * Mr.
Lackaye Is made for the part, the part
for him. W. A. Brady was the man who
recognized this, and "The Pit" has been
playing almost three years. One recog
nises that Mr. ' Lackaye' s Jadwin Is the
raison d'etre of the play's success. One
scene, perhaps unparalleled in/ its pecu
liar thrillâ the panic In "the Pit"â the
play has, but on Mr. Lackaye's powerful
characterization of the wheat speculator
"The Pit' 1 depends for its chief success. '
Virile, forceful, vital -as always
Lackaye's portraiture here has been, he
has In this play more of subtlety, fine
ness, than poslbly he has ever before
brought to anything. Jadwin's gradual
and deepening absorption in his business,
the growing strain of it, the Aladdin-like
imaginations of the deranged speculator,
his careless tenderness to his wife, and
then the powerful, pitiful fall, when, sur
rounded by yelling brokers, his hat, coat
gone, Jadwln Is howled from the floor
of "the pit." ruined, all Is magnificently
pictured.
The scene before in Jadwin's office Is
fine preparation, fine drama â the whole
a strong personal triumph for Mr.
Lackaye.
The scene of the "pit" alone Is worth
seeing, with its hundreds of howling
speculators â a rather wonderful piece
of realism. Mr. Lackaye is. well sup^
ported in chief by Miss. Jane Baker as
Mrs. Jadwin. and "The Pit" should be v
seen by every one.

clared his : Honor -emphatically. ' : " ; '. V
. The declaration was made "during the
trial of the 'suit of . Frank^E: 'Gold for a
divorce v from:his wife,, Nora; J. Gold. .The
man objected strenuously to paying $50; a
month for the support of; the four minor
children. This roused the ire of Judge
Hebbard. .- . \u25a0â¢.\u25a0\u25a0-. '\u25a0â¢:. ..\u25a0:.\u25a0 \u25a0-..\u25a0 \u25a0'..: ; .
\u25a0 ,"You ought. to be glad to contribute to.
their support," said the Judge. ."There
are many people sin this city ; who .would
be : more than 'pleased \to \u25a0 support .- four
children if they had them. 1 am one of
them." '/ -â¢ \u25a0;â¢ ... :'.*.- .' -.'\u25a0 ' ':\u25a0\u25a0 .'. - i ;.â¢ : ' \u25a0\u25a0'.-\u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0'.-. '
Gold sayÂ« his wife on ' divers occasions
pursued him with: various weapons,; such
as pistols, butcher knives and cleavers.
Had he'not ; been a good'runner, ;he' de : .
clared.V she would have 'i stopped ,, the ' di
vorce suit 'during one of, her: man -hunts.
-. "She is half. Indian, your Honor,", he
pleaded Ito ,j help back up hli * uncorrobo
rated testimony regarding his wife's habit
of taking ; the war , path.
"You knew that . when you married her,
did you nor?" asked the Judge. Gold
admitted that he did.
"Well, you took her. for better or
worse,"- declared his Honor. *;-. ! .
Gold muttered something that sounded
like, "I certainly, got the worat."
His suit for divorce upon; the "ground of
cruelty was denied, and he was ordered
to contribute $50 monthly 'to, the support
of the children. The unwilling martyr to
the Roosevelt idea went away dejected.

Cattle Thieves in Oregon
LEADEES NOW ;IN JAIL
Special ' Dispatch to . The Call.
Sept. 12.-^After years of
'â¢outlawry : In ; Wheeler >\u25a0â¢ County, stealing
cattle -and -horÂ¥es""and''irti6otingr sheep,
(.T.( .T. H. jEdmondson . and his "two aonu
have been captured and convicted, by
the cool "daring:: of a man ' known 'to
stockmen as Jesse' Selkirk and -'anVex-.
perienc'ed cattleman,%but'who'iri reality
it is said ',1s a San Francisco detective.
i For more '.'than" three; years Wheeler
County -ranchmen "have ..." been ; preyed
upon by a cold-blooded 'enemy, and fre
quently .when a round-up' failed to ac
count for* many.: missing '< sheep/ . they
were found piled in secluded gulches,,
where they had been shot by the ranch
men's enemy. , Often .as | many \u25a0as 300
sheep ; were found â¢ killed In .'a single
spot. . Numbers of .- horses . and "cattle
were also | stolen and never accounted
for. Plnker'ton.men were employed by
the score by the Stockmen's Associa
tion, but the gang-, could spot the city
men miles away, and. no arrests resulted.
Eighteen; months' ago a man 1 named
Jesse Selkirk made his appearance. He
was ; a : typical cattleman in appearance,
at first-rate ; ranchman and Bs physically
the.superior of :any one In; the county,
as a number . of hard-fought bouts soon
indicated. He, roped and branded horses
and broke a number to ride and work In
harness. He was rough and taciturn in
his manner and was looked upon* with
suspicion by. many of the ranchmen.
; Soon after Selkirk took up his abode
with Edmondsona and lived as one of
them, and rumor said he, was enamored
of : Edmondson's ; daughter.. About a
month ago Bob Edmondson went- into
the; woods alone, and failed to return.-
Llttle thinking his brother l had been
marched to-ja4r at the point ef Sel
kirk's "gun, Jim, the other brother, ac
companied Selkirk to a secluded spot/
where he met his ; brother's fate. Arch
McKay, the gang's leader.S and another
member of .the gang were captured in
like manner. \aese two afterward
broke-Jail. Then Selkirk took old man
Edmondson to - Jail at Fossil, thus com
pleting:, the capture of .the entire gang. 1

GRANEY'S FEE
IS DEDUCTED
Manager Coffrotli Withholds
$1000 When Settling
With the , Battling Dane
BRITT PAYS JEFFRIES
Heavy-Weight Champion Is
Recompensed for His
Pilgrimage to This City
When Manager Nolan received a check
for Battling Nelson's share of the pro
ceefis of last Saturday's fight at Colma
the figures did not look familiar to him.
He called Manager Jim Coff roth's at
tention to an apparent discrepancy of
51000 between the check and the amount
he expected to receive. It was explained
to him ttiat he had overlooked the matter
of Eddie Graney's fee of $1000. for referee-
Ing the fight.
Xolan stormed about, but Manager
Coffroth stood his ground. After losing
a half-dozen decisions on the referee
Question In the last ten days he deter
mined to win at least one. He explained
to Xolan that had the latter ac
cepted Graney at any time up
to the day of the fight the
little horseshoer's fee would have been
$500. But as the selection of Graney
was postponed until the last minute
through the stubbornness of Nolan Man
ager Coffroth decided he was entitled to
the fee which Jeffries would have re
ceived had he officiated.
In discuesing the matter last night
Nolan said: "I have charged up $666
against Coffroth and Britt, this amount
btfing what I consider their share of the
referee's fee. If either of them ever
wants to talk business with me again re
garding a match with Nelson he must
pay his share of that amount." "
Coffroth has maintained from the start
that the fighters and not the club had to
pay the referee. The Britts selected
Jeffries and they paid the big fellow $1000
for his pilgrimage from the south. They
accepted Eddie. Graney as a last resort,
but they did not name him. that duty
devolving upon Nolan.
Jimmy Britt leaves the city to-morrow
morning for a trip through L^ke County
on horseback. He will be accompanied by
Tiv Kreling and William Pratt, Britt
intended to be gone two weeks, but judg
ing from the many theatrical offers Slan
ager Willie Erin has received, Jimmy's
ride will probably be cut short. Britt
is apparently one of the most popular of
defeated fighters.
An expert showman said yesterday, in
discussing Britfs relations with the
public: "Jimmy is a better card.' than if
he had defeated Nelson. He can' without
a doubt make more money than he could
before he lest. He put up a game fight
in as great a battle as was ever fought
in the prize ring, and he Is as game
a loser as be is a fighter. There will
undoubtedly be a return match between
\u25a0the pair. It Is one victory each now.
Britt is a good theatrical card and in my
judgment all he needed to bring his
ability to please the public to a fcead was
a glorious defeat."
Manager Britt said last night that he
and his brother had not made up their
minds what to do just yet. "I have sev
eral good theatrical propositions to con
sider, and we may take one of them,"
said Willie.
Manager Coffroth is still undecided re
garding where he will show the moving
pictures in this city. It is possible they
will be displayed in Mechanics' Pavilion.
Five thousand four hundred feet of films
were exposed during the fight. As there
are sixteen pictures on each foot of film
there were a total of 86,409 separate and
distinct pictures taken of the fight-
It will require one hour and fifteen
minutes " to run the pictures through the
machine. Coffroth and Britt will have a
private view of the pictures probably to
night. Later in the .week there will be
an exhibition for the press.

ALL THOROUGHBREDS
Are Registered With the
Jockey Club Which Es
tablishes Their Breeding
J When the annual <sales of thorough-
I bred yearlings are. held at Sheepshead
Bay, New York, next 'spring, there will
I be one consignment of older thorough
| breds from California which Is .\u25a0\u25a0;,ex-
I pected to create a stir among amateur
Uhorscmen.
j For the first time a consignment of
! miniature thoroughbreds suitable for
I polo will be sent on to determine
I whether there is a- market for such
I horses. The consignors will be Captain
W. H. McKittrick and Rudolph Spreck
els. The horses of the former "will be
the product of his Bakersfleld breeding
farm, while Mr. Spreckels' are from his
Sonoma County establishment.
Mr. Spreckels has demonstrated to
his own satisfaction that thoroughbred
ponies which have been raised can be
successfully broken for the polo field.
This Is contrary to general belief.- At
the close of the pony racing: season last
March Mr. Spreckels turned over a
number of his ponies to a competent
man to be prepared for polo.<
Contrary to the expectations of polo
experts, the ponies lost all their desire
to. run away and they are now ready
to play thefgame at any time. The
highest compliment one can pay a pony
is that it can be played in a plain snaf
fle bridle. All Mr. Spreckels' ponies
can be so played and they can turn on
the proverbial blanket.
Tiie instrument which worked such
marvels in the high-strung ponies was
the hackamore, a Spanish device, for
use on saddle horses.- It resembles a
halter .in appearance, and, when in
tended for breaking, horses, it is us
ually made of hair. The reins are
also of hair. No bit is used, the horse
being controlled by pressure [on the
tender part of the nose.
It has proved so effective on the
ponies intended for polo that ; Mr.
Spreckels v:ill have all his racing
ponies broken with it hereafter. The
hackamore is in use in England now,
some of the Hurlingham poloists hav
ing taken samples of it. over there last
winter.
Among the best known ponies Mr.
Spreckels has had .broken . for polo
are Cacahaute, | Brown Peggy and Lot
rix. They have all shown a marked
turn of speed and an ability to pack
weight. All the ponies a-re registered
â¢ with the Jockey Club. This means
they are as blue. Wooded as Sysonby or
Ormondale, otherwise they could not
be registered. 1
Captain McKlttrick's ponies are by
Grandee, which died recently, and by a*
son of Kismet. F. J. .Mackey played (
some Grandee ponies last- winter at
Burlingame and they ran ' like grey
ghosts.
This has been the greatest polo sea
son ever known in the East and fast
ponies have been in great demand. As
the California ponies will be shown
with ball and mallet and between- the
bending poles, the Eastern experts will
know what they are buying.
WOMAN IS SHOT
BY A BURGLAR
3lrs. C. W. Morrell, Daughter
of Steel Trust Man, Victim
of Marauder's Revolver
GREENWICH, Conn., Sept 12.â Mrs: C.
W. llorrell, daughter of E. C. Converse
of New York, an officer of the United
States Steel. Company, was shot by a
burglar, who entered her residence here
early to-day. IJ*t bullet struck her. chin,
shattering the' jaw bone and imbedded
itself in her shoulder.
At 2:30 o'clock a nurse was awakened by
a flash from the burglar's lantern. ' She
screamed and the man attacked her with
the butt of a revolver, bruising her arms
and shoulders, and breaking ' two of her
fingers. A woman guest of Mrs. Morrell
heard the screams and when she -entered
tho nurse's room the burglar, who was
still struggling with the nurse, fired a
shot, 'but the bullet went wild and struck
the ceiling." At this/Juncture, Mrs. Mor
rell appeared on the scene and the man
aimed a shot at her, the bullet taking ef
fect as described. The burglar .dashed
through the door and made his escape.
Several hours later a man was arrested
at the Greenwich railroad station on sus
picion of being tne burglar. He said he
hdd been at the : Morrell residence to see
the cook last evening, -but denied- any
knowledge of the assault.

William Greer Harrison's
Annual Report Discloses
an Extraordinary' Advance
WOULD GIVE UP CHAIE
President Wishes to Eetire
From Active; Labor, but
Members-Oppose the Idea
The annual meeting, of the Olympic
Club and the installation of officers took
place in x the Post-street clubhouse last
night, William Greer Harrison, the presi
dent, presiding.' â¢_".
' In presenting his annual report Presi
dent'Harrison said the. present assets of
the club amount to $510,000 and the liabili
ties to $1C5,550, showing a surplus of $401.
4Â£o in exces3 of. all liabilities. The liabili
ties are: Outstanding bonds, $95,000, and
other liabilities, $13,500.
In this statement no accounting was
made; of the furniture ' nor apparatus,
which, the ; president said, would add
$40,000 to the .value of the assets. During
the past five years; the club .expended
$100,000 in ; permanent improvements and
retired:bonds amounting to $130,000.
Some question having arisen as to the
actual value of the. building, the valua
tion as: it -'appears -in the financial state
ment, presented by .. President Harrison
as $230,000, was mentioned. Harrison ex
plained that the experts appointed by the
insurance companies to make a detailed
report for insurance purposes valued the
building at $260,000. and report the condi
tion of the building ; as ; being practically
perfect, j
: He said the members were now in pos
session of . a property of the value .of
more than $500,000, and in a short time it
would be absolutely, free of the $95,000
i bonded indebtedness.
In "congratulating the club upon its
high standing and firm financial condi
tion Mr. Harrison 'expressed his desire to
retire , from active work at the end of
the 1 year, having served two periods, one
of eight^and'one.of seven years. He ex
plained "that .when he i first took . hold of
the .reins twenty, years ago the club was
in difficulties, and again, when recalled
by ' the ,' wish iof 1000 members, he again
found, the club ; in: a condition of stress.
During the past seven years it had been
his aim to place the club in such a posi
tion that it could never, be again drawn
into difficulties, thus making it possible
for a -younger man to step Into his place
without any risk to the club.
He announced that the building was to
be materially improved." ; There is also
contemplated the establishment of out
door, grounds at Half moon Bay, a coun
try clubhouse and bathing place, all of
which will be - taken hold* of by the new
board. ."\u25a0
The sentiment expressed at the close
of Mr. Harrison's . report was that the
club desired " that -he retain the position
of its president for life. The j same com
plimentary ; sentiment was . extended to
Secretary. John Elliott.
; On motion it ,was decided to 4hank the
retiring directors. 'Dr. Washington .Dodge
and William, Shea.J ' """ ' : /'-- ;â¢
. A gracious .compliment was paid the
memory of the late treasurer, H. B.
Russ. , By , request the new board indi
vidually addressed the members, each de
claring that the utmost harmony pre
vailed in the directorate. The officers for
1905-06 are: -
William Greer Harrison, president: J. C. B.
Hebbard. vice president: John Elliott, sec
retary; H. V. Rwnsdell. treasurer; John J.

False Entries In Racing
Transactions.
CINCINNATI. Sept. 12. â Mrs. Anna
A. Madden, wife o>. John E. Madden,
tho prominent turfman, was on the
witness stand all day in her suit for
alimony. She will resume the stand
to-morrow. Former United States Sen
ator Lindsay of Kentucky, one of Mad
dens counseir said to-night the case
would continue at least two days
longer. 1
Mrs. Madden was frequently In. tears
during her recital. Eddie, her 12-year
old son, sat at his father's* side most
01 the day and seemed intensely inter*
ested in all his mother said. .At the
I noon adjournment she called him and
he ran to her. She hugged him and
cried for several "minutes.- Madden, at
this, flushed and seemed much dis
tressed at the turn of her testimony.
She said he was cruel and a chronic
fault-finder. Twice she had fled from
him to escape, as " she believed, being;
struck. Madden objected to her recelv-*'
ing any visitors or company. He taught
their two boys to box and hired stable
boys to come to the house and box with
them. The two lads were often aa
"bloody 'as pigs"', after these encounters.
Mrs. Madden testified that Madden had
compelled her to make many false en
tries regarding transactions connected
with the turf. He had ordered fal3e rec
ords made to the Jockey Club. In ona ,
instance one of. his horses. Applause,
was recorded as a foal, when tn reality
it was a yearling. SjJBI

% 1 rSTEAMSHIP CENTENNIAL TO MAKE
ANOTHER RUN TO VLADIVOSTOK.
AGED VESSEL CLEARS FOR RUSSIAN PORT
Ship Lismore Ends
a Very Long
Voyage.
Sardomene Goes on
the Overdue
List
. The ancient but still actively employed
steamship Centennial, one of the few
blockade runners to evade the vigilance
of the Japanese, will make another
voyage to a Russian port. She cleared
yesterday for Vladivostok. The war be
ing over there will be none of the ex
citement about this trip that attended her
if-6t venture. Captain Gllboy will be
master of her for this voyage.
The Centennial, as a link with the past,
is one of the most Interesting vessels that
comes Into this harbor. She was built
half a century ago for the Peninsular and
Oriental Steamship Company. She had
side wfc'eels In those days and was one of
the smartest liners In a crack fleet. Pad
dles went out of use and the Centennial
was shorn of her side wheels and fitted
with a propeller. Since then she has been
In many hands and many trades. During
the war with China she was used by the
Japanese as a transport, and as a trans
port she served Uncle Sam during the
Epanish war. â¢
She has carried mules to Manila and
miners to Alaska. In spite of her years
her hull Is still stout, and, although not
epeedy, she gets about In the world of
waters with fair expedition. She will sail
probably to-day.
Ends Lone Vojape.
The BrltlFh ship Lismore, which for 6ome
days has been a candidate for reinsurance, ar
rived yesterday evening, aner a long passage
from Liverpool. She was 176 days on the voy
age. The average British skipper nowadaya is
chary of risking canvas or spars for the sake of
making time, and the result is a record of
many long voyages. In contrast with the con
servative â¢â¢llmejuieer" is a sallorman like Cap
tain Thompson of the American bark Hornâ
TÂ»rd Bound, which recently completed a record
run from England to this port. While rou.id
lr.Â£ Cape Horn the Homeward Bound overtook,
and passed two British ships, both larger ves
sels. The Britishers were Jogging along under
lower topsails. The Homeward Bound had
' - r. her royal staysails set and was humming
f alone at a steamship gait. Captain Thompson
I ioÂ»s more sails than the average British skip
per, but in the merchant marine. In a paying
trade, time is money and the Homeward Bound
saves enough time to compensate the owners
for far more than Thompson's canvas bills.
The Homeward Bound will soon gall for Aus
traiia and the shipping world is waiting with
interest lor a new record between here and the
Antipodes.
Pacific Mall Lilnerx.
The Pacific Mall liner Manchuria. Captain
Saundera. is due here to-morrow from the Ori
ent. It was on the Manchuria that the Taft
party sailed to the Far East. The Korea left
Nagafcaki yesterday, homeward bound, and _ the
Mongolia, from here, arrived at Yokohama.
The City of Peking left Mazatlan for this port
September /V and en the same day the City of
Panama *lfft the - -isthmw. homeward bound.
The Peru, bound for the isthmus, left Acapulou
I he Ovrrdne JLIhI.
The British uhip fiardcrmene, _ aow out IUS
duys from " Rotterdam for tn:s port, was placed
on the overdue list yesterday at 7 i>er cent.
The other voy&els on the overdue lict are quoted

WILL REPRESENT
THE VATICAN
Pope Sends Bishop William
H. 0 ? Connell of 3laihe on
Special Mission to Japan
TO EE3IAIN. IN OEIEXT
Head of the Catholic Church
Hopes to Christianize
Nipponese by Diplomacy
PORTLAND. Me.. Sept. 12.â Bishop
William H. O'ConneH, of the Roman
Catholic diocese *of Maine, announced
to-day his Intention to leave here for
Japan on a special mission on behalf
of Pope Pius IX. Bishop O'Connell de
clines to state the purpose of his visit,
but it is believed to be an Important
mission from the Vatican to the Em
peror of Japan, decided upon about tha
time' of the conclusion of peace' be
tween Japan and Russia. It is under
stood in Catholic circles here that tha
Blahop will present to the Emperor the
personal congratulations of the^Pope
on the magnanimous manner in 'which
Japan yielded to Russia, and also to
thank the Emperor for his kindly in
terest in the Catholic subjects of Japan
and to express the hope that this in
terest may continue.
ROME. Sept. 12.â 1n connection with thÂ«
forthcoming visit to Tokio of Bishop
William 'H. O'Connell of the dio
cese of Maine as special envoy
of, the Pope to the Emperor of
Japan it Is now known that the ap
pointment of such a representative has
been in contemplation for a long time.
It was thought that the Japanese people
could never be converted individually,
but would nave to be Christianized, if at
alt. by diplomatic methods. â¢
At the present time u.e Catholic church
In Japan is suffering from the Imputation
that it Is a' French institution, and
France being the ally of Russia, the
church^ comes in for a share of popular
disfavor. To counteract this it was sug
gested that the Pope should come for
ward as a sovereign and appoint a repre
sentative at Toklo, at the same time re
questing the Japanese Government to
send a Minister to the Vatican. The sug
gestion was well received by his Holiness.
It was at first believed that Archbishop
Ireland of St. Paul would be sent to
Japan, but the honor has fallen on
Bishop O'Connell. who is in high favor
at the Vatican. Bishop O'Connell's stay
in Japan Is likely to be a protracted one.
The selection of an American for such
a mission is considered evidence of the
friendship" entertained by the Pope for
the people of the United States, such
missions being usually entrusted to
Italians.

rrSV." TOSK. Sept. 12.â The lefponse of
s'.ockÂ» to the Â«nÂ«a.gemÂ«nx of gold for import
vrss testimony to the ltr.porlanre attached to
lhÂ« question of reMcf from a possible etrin
e nc% c' rroncy. The advance was decisive and
coiKprvhcneive. following: promptly upon Â»he
c-rour.eorr.tnt of the engairennent. It was the
eo.-r.:non tcUcf that to-day's engacÂ«sent of 41,
200.000 wkÂ« preSirainsry to 'an extended inward
movement cf ec.ld. It iras at ?. symptom of
conditions which rr.a<*.iÂ» tn:s poc^lble that the
develrprr.ent wm effective raihir ihan from the
amount Involved. Tlie fear " wes paining
Crcund In stock . nsrket circles ;hat lasup-r
â¢ifcle obstacles would be opposed to the relia
.;ui_hrr.cnt of fold beid an banking reserves in
' th* preat foret/ni Â»oney centers. The obvtouc
Indention cf the Russian Government to float a
iurxe loan, the possibility of additional .bor
row ir.ss ty Japan and the announcement cf -a
larje number cf ra>aller financial underÃtand
,ngs-which, had evidently delayed until ' tfce
-â¢^nlnjr r***e. pointed to the pozKihlilty that
.:-.<se claims for credit* would have priority
svtr others. 'The course 'â¢ of our own money
markets for the last few weeks ha* made it
: r rf sctly evident that without iomÂ« addilldna.l
?< source* the extraordinary dercand for funds
Mould exhaust the banking reserves to an ex
tent that would .cause great tension in the
raonÂ«Â»y market and possible disaster u>'over
extended epecuiation. -It â¢ Js now determined
the outward . course of our commodities
r %* -Mublithtd a sufficient volume of credits
ft.rved co that* the domestic : money markets
have c resort for relief In case of urgent nte
etnelty. The effect upon Â«yÂ«cutattve eentlraent
was pronounced- The fold seems to have been
Btcored upon its arrival from ; South" Africa In
London, after rather active competition, and
the present supply available fcr import seems
limited. The- outgo of currency from New
1 in other directions uiso continues very
large. The Sub- Treasury has absorbed alreauy
s.nce the last bank statement. .Â».J,r>lt,tK!U.
ments by exporter are st;)l, K oing to the inte
rior and $500,000 was deposited at the Sub-
Treasary to-day for teiegraphic transfer to San
irancisco. Time money rates continue to ad
vance in ,\sw York, and borrowers on call are
paying off their c-blieations and taklnp out Ume
loans. Discount ratte in London rose again
to-day, but in Berlin th?rc was a light rec*4
sion. in ppite cr yester.taj-r advance in the
Imp-rial B.ir.k ratr. Thr> volume of tiealings
to-day expanded somewhat, but wae attributed
vtry largely to pro'e-ssiunal sources. Commis
eion houses complained of the lifeless outside
demand in . stock*.- The XVeathtr Bureau's
weekly crop report bulletin confirmed the pre
vailing confidence over the grain crop, especial
ly the corn crop, and the ccrn carriers wore
relatively stronger than the rest of the list.
The special movement In Sloee Sheffield | Stf-el
was du^ to the declaration of a stock dividend.
Prices touched th* highest in the final hour,
when the market broadened considerably, and
Union Pacific. St. Paul, Pennsylvania. Erie and
the United States Steel Mocks were in large
demand. The close was steady at about the
best of the day.
Bonds \u25a0 were firm. Total \u25a0 sales, par value,

was granted a divorce yesterday on the
ground of crufty. Their only child,
Gladys, 13 years \u25a0 old. was the principal

custody of the child.
-Webster did not appear to contest the
suit. -In his absence the complaint was
read to the. little daughter. As the in
stances of the father's cruellies to the
mother were read the child sorrowfully

AGED HUSBAND
SUED BY WIFE
J ames Thompson, . Capitalist;
Is Eestrained From Using
Property by Court's Order
CHARGED WITH CRUELTY
Woman Says That Her Angry
Spouse Set Private De
tectives to /Follow; Her
Because aged James; Thompson, capi
talist, employed private detectives, to
shadow his wife his affairs ; are tem
porarily tied up": by- a* restraining order,"
and she is suing him for a divorce on the
ground of cruelty. Judge Hebbard 'al
lowed the wife' $50 per., month' temporary,
alimony and $200 for counsel^ fees. \u25a0
Thompson is over; 70 years old and his
wife is comely and 40. \ The couple have
been living at 228 Liberty street. 4n which
section, of the city the-'defendant owns
considerable real estate.
They had been married a little over a
year when Thompson seemed to ; become
suspicious of his" wife. He had her sha
dowed ;by private detectives. When Mrs.
Thompson discovered that she .was being
watched she became indignant and*, left
her husband. She filed suit for divorce;'
and immediately afterward got out a tem
porary restraining- order to keep -ThompÂ£
son from transferring any of his wealth?.
The case came before Judge Hebbard on
an order ' to show 'cause why. the restrain
ing order should not. be -made permanent.'
The court decided that the order should
remain in force pending the decision : of
the divorce suit. Thompson's
objected, maintaining that it would entail
great financial loss to his client by stop
ping him from making certain real estate
transactions. , The~ order .was" granted;
however. \u25a0 and the capitalist's affairs are,
completely tied: up.
