IN SWEDEN

Are Opposed to
Strife.
Demands Upon Norway
to Be Supported
by Force.
King Oscar Unable to Stem
Tide That Is Carrying
Nation to Combat.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKHOLM, July 17. â One week*
careful sounding of Swedish opinion
Juxtlnett the statement that Sweden la
prepared to employ force to support her
demand that dissolution of the union be
effected on legal and honorable terms.
There is nothine to warrant Dr. Svent
Hi din's assertion that the nation is
asleep. On the contrary, it Is wide
awake. When the country has fully
made up its mind, Norway will discover
that Sweden's dellberateness has been
neither cowardice nor lndesclsion. All
classes cf the communityâ members of
the Riksdag, editors, lawyers, bankers,
merchants and professorsâ ardently de
sire a pacific solution of the crisis, but
they do not want peace that will cause
Sweden to hang her head for shame be
fore the whole world. Such a peace the
Swedes would consider worse than war.
This sentiment prevails in Stockholm, I
except among the Socialist workingmen,
but it is even stronger in the provinces,
which are live with warlike enthusiasm.
The pe&eant classes are especially eager I
for armed chastisement for the insult {
Norway offered their adored King.* !
Although there is. no mistaking
Sweden's readiness to resort to force in
thÂ» last extremity, it Is equally certain
that the Swedes sincerely prefer peace
ful settlement.
RIKSDAG MAY RECOMMEXD DELAY.
That would be; the meaning of a. post
ponement of the negotiations for six
months, which many believe the Riksdag
committee will recommend. The delay.
It is believed, will allow the Norwegian
passions to cool and at the same time
crystallize public opinion in Sweden.
Postponement or no postponement, how
ever, it seems improbable that Sweden's
determination to secure a settlement
\u25a0which will satisfy her pride will undergo
alteration. The Swedes are confident
that, when their conditions are known,
the world will consider them moderate
and legitimate and place all responsi
bility for bloodshed in Scandinavia, on the
Norwegians.
Count oyldenstolpe authorizes a denial
of the statement published in the United
States to the effect that the, Kaiser and
King Oscar discussed the preliminaries
of a Swedish-German alliance. He says
the idea is a fantasy. Inquiries among
leaders of public opinion here show that
the Swedes shrink from such an alliance
because they feel that it would cost them
dearly, some way or another.
Kl\<; FORGIVES NORWEGIANS.
BERLIN, July 17.â Dr. Hugo Ganz, cor
respondent of the Frankfort Zeltung. has
had an interview with Kins .Oscar of
Sweden at Stockholm, during which his
Majesty said he admired the way In
which the Norwegians won to their' side
eH the European publicists.
\u25a0 "The wrong remains wrong, said the
King, adding that the Norwegians had
surprised him by the suddenness of their
act.
King Oscar denied that he had precipi
tated the crisis by declining to accept
the resignation of the Norwegian Cabinet,
for the -Norwegians themselves had de
clared that whoever accepted a portfolio
would cease to be a Norwegian.
The correspondent remarked that he
cad heard only words of respect for the
King In Norway, to which his Majesty
replied: .
"For my part, I have forgiven the Nor-
Veigiar.s and hope to God that the Swed
ish people also will remain calm, for It
â¢â¢*,woul.d on iy be hanging a millstone about
to restore the union forcibly."
The King also said that the appoint
ment of a Swedish Prince %o the Nor
wegian throne would : certainly be the
simplest solution of the difficulty, but the
result would be distrust in Sweden or in
Norway. Every time public opinion,
either in Sweden or in Norway, was dis
pleased with the sovereigns' acts the cry
would be raised that "the son does this
to please the father," or, "the father
does this to please the son."

Has One Meal in Eight
Days and Sleeps
Out at Night.
Helen Coulter Leaves Home to
Find Work, but Encounters
Terrible Hardships.
Special Dlupaich ' to Tbt Call.
SAN JOSE, July 17.â "1 started out to
look for work in the country. \u25a0 I couldn't
get any and I just kept on walking,"
said Miss Helen Coulter of 1608 Geary
street, San Francisco, in answer to the
inquiries of the deputy Sheriffs who were
present when the giriÂ» nearly dead from
starvation and exposure, was taken to
the County Jail last night as a common
vagrant. The woman was found early
in the day wandering, famished, dusty
and travel worn, on the King road near
this city. Residents in that section ob
served her and telephoned to Sheriff
Ross. Deputy Sheriff Ray Starbird was
dispatched to bring the woman In. and
for the first time in eight weary days
Miss Coulter saw friendly faces about
her and was accorded the shelter of a
roof. â¢ . . .
Sixty ' miles she traveled looking for
work. For eight days she walked along
the dusty road In search of a chance to
make a living. In this time she had ! but
one good meal.J.,The' remainder^f^the
time she subsisted on such fruits' affthay
be found at this period of the year. For
eight nights she slept- by, the roadside
without shelter or covering.
She tells her story, â¢modestty^and;-con
vincingly. There pa '&'_ frankness â¢In â¢ her
manner that compels | belief and " there 'Is
no reason to doubt the correctness of her
story. "' ''':;â¢; \u25a0 * \u25a0'
"I lived with ray r aunt at 1608 . Geary
street, San Francisco," she .said, "but
my aunt did not treat me very well and
I decided to leave home and seek work
in the country. I thought I could easily
find work on some ranch. 1 have found
that jj this was a mistaken idea. Every
place in which I called seemed to have
all the help necessary. Refusal after re
fusal met me and I kept wandering
south, walking by day and sleeping by
the roadside when night came on. I had
nothing to eat but the fruit that grew
by the roadside and no covering to pro
tect me from the cold."
Only once in her conversation did she
show any signs of a mind affected- by
the hardships she underwent in her long
tramp. . . , ..
"I was not able to find â¢ work because
none of my friends belonged to the j Ma
sons," said she pathetically. "No one
told me that. I found it ; out from my
own experience.
"The first night out, I. slept at. Gum
Hill. San Francisco. The second night
was spent at Cypress Lawn . Cemetery.
On neither of these nights did I have
anything to eat. The third night I slept
in a San Mateo lot. This day I had a
good meaL The next ffive. nights I slept
in a San Mateo lot, by - the roadside, in
the Empire school grounds, in the Alum
Rock canyon and in the Alum Rock
hills. In this time I had only one cup of
coffee, two glasses of beer and' a sand
wich." -
The woman, who appears to be about
25 years of age and of more than ,the
average Intelligence, was taken to / the
Red Cross Hospital last night. Despite
her long fast, she was unable to eat and
was satisfied with a cup of coffee.. To
day she shows the effects of a good
night's rest.
LEAVES TO VISIT FH.IBXD.
Relative- TÂ«|| of the Girl's Departure
From Her Home.
Mrs. A. Coulter, -.the- mother "of ..Miss
Helen Coulter; who was . found nearly
dead from starvation in San Jose, when
seen last night at her home* at -1608
Geary street, said the girl departed last
week to visit a friend and she , was
thought to be safe with some of: her ac
quaintances. :An older daughter and
the mother are the' only members of the
family in the city, the father having be
come estranged from the home. None of
them knew of the sad plight of their rel
ative until told of the fact by a news
paper man" last night.
"She bid me good-by on Thursday,
saying she would return in the even
ing," said Mrs. Coulter last night. '"She
said that she was going to the house of
a friend and When she did not appear at
bedtime we thought that she .was safe
with some of her acquaintances. She
was a very religious girl and had few
friends â and they were of only^the bet
ter class. I; know 'of ; no ; reason 'for.' her
being found in that condition and can
not imagine what would take her so far
out of the city." V

NEW YORK, July 17.â A1l books of the
Town Topics Publishing Companyâ check
books and canceled vouchers and partic
ularly accounts showing ( receipts anrt dis
bursements in connection with "Fads and
Fancies," for which wealthy persons
have subscribedâ will be thrown open to
the inspection of Assistant District At
torney Krotel to-morrow. This decision
to give all the information desired by
the District Attorney was a very sud
den change on the part of Edward Lau
terbach, counsel for the publication.
As W." L. Daniels, secretary and treas
urer of the ' Town Topics Company, had
been, until a few days ago, treasurer of
the Society Editors' Association . and as
Charles Stokes Wayne is editor for- both
"the weekly and the association, Krotel
was anxious to. learn if there was
ther and more-; intimate r connection be
tween them. , To this end he. ordered. Dan
iels to .produce the' Town Topics books, \u25a0\u25a0
but Daniels was"advised by Judge Deuel
vat] ttÂ» tSpeclal sSessions - Court,' who â¢ ifi^one
of 'the'directbrs of the Town Topics Com
pany, to consult with Lauterbach before
delivering the. books asked for.' The law
yer talked with Krotel over', the j tele r
phone, 'and^siild'he Kad" lnstructed Daniels
not. to produce the books.*"-' He said there.
was no authority for delving into the pri
vate . affairs of the company, especially
as' Colonel "W. D. Mann, proprietor of
Town .Topics, would be .. here in a few
days, returning from Europe.
There was some prompt action when
District- Attorney Jerome was Informed
by ; Krotel of the lawyer's defiance.' At
once an ' "information," "as it is called,
or a complaint, was drawn up in John
Doe proceedings .. to be instituted -before
the Grand Jury and then subpenas for
Daniels 'and Judsre Deuel" were drawn up
and served on these officers of the Town
Topics Company. They were commanded
to appear before the Grand Jury to-mor
row morning and to bring with them all
of I the company's books and 'accounts
and especially those .'which Â§ will show
what disposition had been made of .the
$150,006 -' received as" subscriptions , for
"Fads and Fancies."
â¢ .Lauterbach then yielded and promised
that all books and papers should be sub
mitted for examination.
Krotel, assisted by an expert account
ant, will begin his Inspection to-morrow
morning. While the. subpenas command
ing. Judge Deuel and Daniels to appear
before, the Grand Jury are still in force,
it is not likely they will 'be asked to ap
pear until the examination is ended. * \u25a0""â¢
. In his endeavors to reach the wealthy
men: and women of. ' society who sub
scribed for either "Fads and Fancies" or
"America's ' Smart Set," Krotel has met
wlthlittle success.
He : received- many letters to-day, how
ever, telling of persons who had been
forced \u25a0; to pay for one or the other by
threats similar to those employed in the
case of Mr. Post - /
Charles Ahle, who : passed several > days
in the , Tombs, charged with attempted
extortion by Mr. Post, was released to
day, on bond. Before the week is ended
the Grand Jury. will indict Ahle. '

WILLIAMSON HAS
UNPLEASANT DAY
Congressman Takes Stand
in His Own Behalf in Land
Fraud Cases in Portland
HENEY MAKES A POINT
Gains an Admission From
the Witness Which Injures
the Side of the Defense
PORTLAND, July 17.â Congressman
John Newton Williamson was on the
uitneFs stand in the United States Cir
cuit Court in his own behalf* in the land
fraud cases to-day. The defense has con
tended that Williamson was at Prineville
only for a short time in July. 1902, and
when the Fame thing was affirmed on the
etand \u2666)>â¢ Williamson to-day, he was con
fronted by District Attorney Heney with
the rrplstor of the Poindextfr Hotel, in
which, under date of June 15, 1902, was
found the signature "John N. William
eon." The Congressman said the signa
ture was not his own, but he admitted
that the word "Prineville" following his
name, appeared to be in hi? handwriting.
Moreover, he was not prepared to swear
that he was not in Prineville at that
time.
This point fits in with the theory of the
Government that V.'illiamson was in
Prinevilie two weeks before the filings
were made, that there was a perfect
understanding between the defendants,
that he arranged with his wife to file and
that *Â«? then went back to The Dalles
and negotiated a loan to make payment
6a the claim and caused his wife to file
shortly after his departure.
1 fro
Heney offered in evidence a letter m
Congressman Williamson to Binger Her
manr., then Commissioner of the General
Land Office, In which Williamson sought
to influence the Commissioner to enlarge
the Blue Mountain forest reserve, so as
to furnish lands for a further extension
of their sheep rang/; and to crowd out
the cattlemen grazing in that district.
The defense objected to the letter and
the enurt ruled against its admission.
In testifying !n his own behalf, the
Congressman merely entered a general
denial of the allegations of the Govern
ment and on two occasion*. In answer
to questions by his counsel, declared that
he. had no part In or knowledge of any
conspiracy to suborn perjury and that he
knew of no violation of the law. He de
nied having seen two "of ths entrymen
who have appeared against him until just
recently and at no time before the filing.
The defense introduced the testimony
of a few witnesses to show the good rep
utation of the defendants and had called
another one, wTie.n Judge E>e Haven
asked Heney if the Government intended
to offer any evidence counter to this.
The District Attorney said it did not.
Judge* De Haven then ruled that no more
witnesses would be heard on the ques
tion of reputation. The defense pro
tested, but the court would not yield.
Judge De Haven said that inasmuch as
the Government was not going to try
to provp a bad reputation, he would in
struct the jury that a good reputation for
the defendants had been established.
The defense was not satisfied and of
fered to show that it would call about
twenty witnesses, among them Senator
Fulton. Circuit Judges Ellis and Brad-
Fhaw and a number of prominent Port
land people to testify to their good -rep
utation. The court gave them leave to
make the record show as- they wished.
The Government will have but little testi
mony to offer in rebuttal.

SAN JOSE. July 17.â The Grand Jury
has I been, summo.ned.. by._the..l3istrjct*. At
torney to meet on Wednesday morning to
take up the case of Mrs, Gustay Hueter,
who phot and killed her husband on Sat-
urday' night." When asked to'-Vlay Vhat
action the authorities intend to Â«, take, the
District Attorney was 1 non-committal.""*
"The Grand.. Jury has -been. summoned,
to meet on Wednesday and you can draw^
yonr o*arn- ronctusmna -frum" that â factr*^
said he. "None of jthje relatives have
made any complaint so " fat, although I
understand that there have been, several.,
consultations - between . the . members of
the family relative to "the .position,' to be
taken by them in this affair. So far as I
can learn, the relatives. accept the story,
told by Mrs. Hueter in Its entirety.
"I may say that there Is absolutely no
new evidence in the case. We have fol
lowed up every rumor to Its source, but
have found nothing that goes to disprove
Mrs. Hueter's story of the tragedy. The
rumor that she was infatuated with a
ycung physician remains a rumor and we
have no reason to think that there is
any truth in" it."
Attorney E. E. Cothran, counsel for
Mrs. Hu-eter. stated that no application
for a writ of habeas corpus would be
made unless his client was detained in
the County Jail for an excessive period.
ThÂ« attitude of his client, he said, was
to put nothing In the way of a full and
free investigation of the case.
Mrs. Hueter has expressed her willing
ness to endure all the privations of life
in the jail until the matter is cleared up
to the satisfaction of the authorities.
The District Attorney is in possession
of several photographs which show the
position of Hueter's body after the fatal
shot was fired. The body is lying near
the edge of the bed, partially uncovered.
It is In the position naturally assumed
by a man in sleep. The face is turned
down toward the pillow, the hands are
crossed, the right hand over the left and
hanging loosely by the side of the bed.
The shotgun is lying parallel with the
bed and the revolver is shown resting on
the bed clothes about a foot behind the
body.
The whole attitude of the body is
strongly indicative of sleep and this im
pression, conveyed to the minds of those
t ho were the first to enter the room af
ter the shooting, has probably given rise
to many of the rumors set afloat since
news of the tragedy became public.
Hueter's body was taken to-day to San
Francisco, whence it will be removed to
morrow to the Odd Fellows' Cemetery for
cremation.

ORGANIZED CHARILY
UNDER DISCUSSION
Convention 3egins
Its Work in
Portland
Miss Felton Takes
an Active Part
in Session. .
PORTLAND. July 17.â Trains yesterday
and to-day brought delegates. to the con
ference on chanties and ; correction by
the hundreds. The conference both in
the general session. and the several sec
tions got -down to business to-day pre
liminary to a hard week's work. The
general session to-day considered state
supervision and administration," the topic
being introduced by the report of the
committee on State supervision- and ad
ministration, read by. Miss. Julia Lathrop
of Hull House," Chicago. .
The' report says, in part, that the great
essentials of State supervision and ad-"^
ministration, as they appear to us, are:
Firstâ Absolute independence of the ex
ploitation which we know as "political
inlluence" on the one hand and on the \u25a0
other hand strict accountability to â¢ ' the
proper Stale authorities. ,
Secondâ The enlistment of the finest
trained ability in the public service.
Thirdâ v sustained intelligent "public in
terest.
Miss Lathrop followed the reading of
the report by a paper on the subject.
The discussion of the subject was opened
by Thomas Nj Strong, of Portland, chair
man of the general convention. He was
followed by Ernest "Blcknell of Chicago.
"What right has the public to know
about the 'public and private charities,
and how shall it learn about them?" was
the topic treated by Miss Frances Greely
Curtis, a member of 'the State Board of
Charrties of Massachusetts and by Ens
ley Moore, a member of the Board of
Public Charities of Illinois. "The juve
nile, courts in the small city and town"
and "The girl offender and probation
and causes of and remedies for delin
quency" were the topics under discus
sion In the Juvenile cour.t section. The
discussion was oarticipated in by proba
tion officers of several of the larger cities*
of the country. The section in charge of
the committee on needy families- and
their homes discussed "The charities en-,
dorsement committee and investigation."
The first of these subjects was intro
duced by Miss "Kajtherlne C. Felton, sec
retary of the Associated Charities ot
San Francisco, and the latter, by A. W.
Gutridge, superintendent of the. Asso
ciated Charities of St. Paul.
The,re:>ort of the committee on needy
families and their homes -.was delivered
to-night by Chairman James â¢F. Jack
son. He said in part:
The change of emphasis in the principles of
organized charity has j come in \u25a0 the direction
of a more positive, constructive and thoifiugh
polng- policy. Organized charity no longer
stops at remedying 1 . Individual needs; it In
quires into the general causes which produca
them. The evils, for example, of overcrowd
ing' in tenements lead to the . housing problem
and' sanitation and to tha anti-tuberculosis
campaign, to fresh air work and public "play
grounds. In thus striving to deal with pri
mery causes organized charity, while no less
individualistic in treatment, has acquired civic
responsibilities. Though not neglectng in
dividual needs, it has' become more radical
In its endeavors to prevent them. On such
grounds â¢ charity claims to be a living, grow-
Ins movement. \u0084.'.'
After a general discussion , of ,this re
port-an interesting paper was read by
Mrs. , Clara P. ,' Bourland of Peoria, 111.,
on "Co-operation Between Women's
Clubs and Organized Charities." This
subject, like its predecessor, was followed
by a general discussion)

'pT. PETERSBURG, July 17. â M. de

so-Japanese alliance and to present the
Mikado with carte blanche In China

Kanitchatka and North Siberia. Ru>
iÂ»ia will offer to assume part of the
Japanese debt and Trill avoid loan*,
cession of territory or anything likely
to hurt her prestigre at home.
De Witte's popularity abroad is re
lied upon to gain foreigii support tor
this programme, while the bureaucracy,
which is strongly antagonistic to him,
looks upon his departure from Russia
as good riddance of a formidable op
ponent.
De Witte accorded an Interview to a
press representative to-day. The con
versation gravitated quickly to the high
mission with which the Russian states
man is charged and the - disposition of
the foreign press lo interpret his ap
pointment as an indication that Russia
had decided to make peace at any price.
"No, no!" said he, straightening up in
his chair and speaking slowly and dis
tinctly, as if weighing the value of each
word. "In the^first place, I have been
designated by the Emperor as his Em
bassador Extraordinary for pourpar
lers with the Japanese plenipotentia
ries to ascertain whether it is possible
to conclude a treaty of peace. My per
sonal views are of secondary impor
tance, but my ideas are in entire accord
with those of my friend, Count Lams- I
dorff.
"I have received express instructions
from his Majesty and shall follow them.
"The ultimate decision remains in the
handÂ» of the Emperor and it Is for him
to decide the destinies of Russia. The
Emperor is the friend of peace and de
sires peace, but I very much fear that
the Japanese terms vtill be such that
tve Tt-ill be unable to reach an accord.
"Secondly, the world should disabuse
its mind of the idea that Russia wants
peace at any price. There are two par
ties in Russia. One of them favors the
continuation of the war a l'outrance â
this is a large and Influential party. The
other, to which I belong, favors peace,
I avow it frankly, because telling the
truth has always been my rule in poli
tics. I was for war before the war be
gan.
"K\"en though there are those two
parties, both would be united if the
Japanese demands wounded the amour
propre of the Russian people or Jeop
ardized our future as a nation.
"1 cm sure If I report that the condi
tions of Japan cannot be accepted, Rus
sia will accept the verdict and the Rus
sian people Trill be ready to continue
the tÂ» ar for years* If necessary.
"Thirdly, Russia is not crushed, as
the foreign press has led the world to
believe. The Interior situation Is, very
eerious, I do not deny, but in Europe
and America the true significance of
what is occurrips is" not, understood.
Correspondents come here' and talk
with a few people In St. Petersburg and
Moscow, misinterpret what is occur
ring and fill the world with false im
:- .-vEs!ons % as to Russia's future.
has little resemblance to
"Western countries. To know Russia, to
understand the soul of the Russian peo*
pie, it Is necessary that one should have
been born here or lived many years in
Russia. The customs and history of the
people are entirely different from those
of Western , nations and Russia cannot
be judged by-Western standards. It' ls
such an immense country, composed of
divers elements and interests, yet the
Russian people are like a great family.
At present - they ' are torn by internal
dissensions, but these divisions would
disappear should the people really- feel
that the Integrity of the country and
its future destiny were at stake.
"Russia is not on the verge of disso
lution as a great power \u25a0 and Is not
obliged to accept any conditions offered,
in spite of the military reverses she has
sustained.
â¢'We are passim? through an Internal
ciisiM. which has been marked. by many
grave events, nnd rrhioh may . have
others wtill In store; but the crisis will
pas*, and In a few years Trill
aesin take her place as a preponderant
power in the European court."
It Js said that Bouligin's successor as
Minister of the Interior will be the
notorious General Ignatieff.
The lull in the revolution, ls due ro
the strong repression of all disorders
by the Government and to the vigorous
measures taken to .prevent ,*aT renewal
of the disturbances. Wealthy, mer
chants and bankers subsidized the rev
olution, harbored rebels - and storod
bombs. German' Socialists assisted.'
German frontier villages served .is â¢; V
basis for the campaign. Now all thla
has been stopped. The resources of the
revolutionists have been cut off. sym-'
pathizers have been banished 1 and .the
German Government is now^watshirt;?

stored the Czar will undertake reforms."
CHINA PATTERXS AFTER JAPAN.
Sendlnc Four. Missions Abroad to Study'

PEKrNG, July 17.^-Aii" edict' was'is

abroad of four missions; to study for
eign political methods. The missions
wlil.be headed respectively by Prince
Tsal -Tche.'Vwho fs of royal' blood; Tai

Fhu Shie Chang, chief assistant to

The edict, which is vaguely worded,
0.-ders the envoys to visit all countries
in the East and West and study for
eign methods generally. None of the
men named speak any foreign lan

separately 'on dates yet undecided.
The idea is generally regarded as a
Etep in the right direction, though it
may prove futile. ,
fAPAA" KEEPS TERMS SECRET.
De Routkowski Says' They Are as Yet
Unknown to Hcssia.
, LONDON', July 17.â M. de Routkowskl,
the Russian financial agent in .London,
said "to-day that he. had not received his
appointment, to- the peace commission,
though he expected to accompany the
plenipotentiaries to Washington. > Since
De "Witte's appointment as chief pleni
potentiary De Routkowski has been
sounded by the Government and has sig
nified his willingness to act- De'Rout
kowskl said:
"Japan has not yet intimated her, terms
and the reports of her alleged terms are
generally speculations. Hints have been
dropped to Russia from time to time,
through British and other sources, but
nothing . positive has yet been proposed
and we have been Informed that Japan
will lay her definite propositions only be
fore the Washington conference. The
Japanese have great confidence in M. de
Witte and 11. de Wltte has great admira
tion for them. The personnel of Rus
sia's commission should convince the
Japanese that peace depends on the rea
sonableness of their terms. I believe Rus
sia's acceptanca of peace proposals is a
greater show* of strength than a contin
uation of the struggle for the sake of
pride. Ending the war and turning her
attention to internal improvement and
the development of her industries will en
hance U*e prestige of Russia more than
a continuation of the conflict until Japan
Is finally overcome."
M. de Routkowski said he. thought the
arrangement for a Russian loan probably
would be made in Paris prior to M. de
Wltte' s departure from that city.

Russia can consent only to such a peace as

plenipotentiaries: must .'remember that they
must defend the Interests not only of - Russia,

Action Will Be Taken
Against Prominent Men
PHILADELPHIA, July 17.â As a result
of advices received ; from Elihu Root,
special counsel for Mayor Weaver, it is
probable that the Mayor will Initiate
criminal prosecution against certain per-^
sons who are ; prominent in municipal af
fairs. .; Root ;â¢: advises .the : Mayor that in
face of ; the , refusal of the District At
torney, "J. C. Bell, to take the initiative
in bringing further prosecution, the.May
or should " exercise" his right . to go" before
a magistrate; and t carry , the prosecutions
as far- as the law will permit him. 7 . This
opinion was sent to the Mayor, to-day and
was .the result ,of a held in
New, York last Friday. Those who par
ticipated â¢in ' the ; conference were former
United States ,, Attorney General Wayne
MacVeagh," who is special counsel for the
committee of | nine . of this city; -former
Judge , Gordon, private j counsel . for Mayor
Weaver;. Julian T. Davies and Joseph S.
Auerbach of counsel for the committee
of seventy.
The purpose of the conference .was to
decide" whether the Mayor should take
the initiative in further prosecutions, \u25a0 the
District ' Attorney :.. having refused !to ;do
so. Mayor Weaver and Judge Gordon
last week requested that the District At
torney, in drawing up indictments against
Councilman Caven and Hill should bring
the" charge" of " conspiracy with certain
other persons to defraud the city. Caven
is under bail for violating his council
manic oath in being interested . in city
contracts, and former. Chief Hill is under
bonds to answer charges of forgery and
falsification of records in "connection with
the of the Tcity's alteration
plants. At the hearing ? given both men
before "the" magistrate, the name of the
contracting firm of D. J. McNichol :/ &
Co.; which is constructing the greater
part \u25a0 of the , filteration system, was fre
quently brought in by witnesses. The
members of the firm are former Insur
ance Commissioner "Israel W. Durham,
the leader of the local Republican organi
zation;'State'Senator J. P. McNichol and
his brother, Daniel J. McNichol. \u25a0;"",,:
The ;; District Attorney j. in refusing , to
add the charge , of . conspiracy to . the in
dictment - drawn . up \u25a0. against Caven and
Hill and to initiate criminal proceedings
against '.'certain other persons," said that
such'charges based on the evidence taken
at the I Caven and' Hill hearings could not
under /the 3 law \be made. r \ii He ; suggested
that the Mayor, take the initiative. Mayor
Weaver and Judge Gordon insisted that
it was the District Attorney's duty, to be
gin prosecutions. â¢ \u25a0'} Bell fi persisted in his
refusal and the^New York conference fol
lowed. \u25a0 â¢. â¢'â¢'. "1
SECRETARY ROOT'S LETTER.
Root's opinion of the question was sent
in a letter to Mayor Weaver to-day.' It
is as follows: ' .
"NEW YORK, July 16. â My Dear Mr.

prosecutions for: such crimes either be
fore the Grand* Jury, or before a com
mitting magistrate and that. he v "has
practically: declined to do either, sug
gesting .that you should proceed before
a magistrate as a private prosecutor.
"The'reasons which led the prosecut
ing officer to take this course I shall not
discuss. The resulting fact alone la im
portant for political consideration.
"It is your duty as Mayor firmly to
see that the laws are enforced and when
you find that they are being set at
naught by criminal combinations it is
your duty to bring the facts to the
knowledge of the officer who is elected
by the people to prosecute the crime.lt
then becomes his duty to prosecute, and
not yours.
'-\u0084"1 think you have done what the law
requires of you in this instance, and
that if the prosecutions so clearly indi
cated -by the evidence in your publica
tion and in the possession of the prose
cuting officer fail for want of a further
action," no one can , justly say that it is
through any, failure* of duty on your
part. Ido not think,. however, that this
settles the question as to your future
action. Although the law does not re
quire you to prosecute, it permits you
to do so up to the' point where the re
turn of the committing magistrate goes
into the hands of the District Attorney.
"I think in default of the action which
â¢ ought. to be taken' by the public prose
cutor that you should, nevertheless 'ex
ercise your right to, go before a magis
trate ; and' carry 'these* prosecutions as
far as the law, permits you to.
"In doing this . you should, I think,
invite the aid of and co-operation of
the District , Attorney, - giving him
every : possible opportunity to take the
prosecutions and ito perform -the duty
for/which he was elected.
THERE . IS MUCH AT STAKE.
"Crimes committed by men .who have
political. power are often sheltered be
hind official Indifference and' Inac
tivity, and then some one has to
do more /than his duty to secure
justice and you will ' not be the
first /.public -/officer who has done
a; great: public service against. the re
sistance'^ of ' : those from whom: the ser
vice [outjhti to come. There is more at
stake here than ..the; mere/ punishment
of isolated offenses. There is the
question whether your city shall con
tinue to be governed by criminals or
shall take its place on the list of Amer
ican cities - capable of honest self-gov
ernment. To secure the right solution
of :thls question a you cannot .omit any
proper and ; lawful effort.
"When you have carried^ the prose
cution through the bands of the com-
mitting magistrate you will hayÂ« dona
everything within your power, and If
the prosecution then fail after coming
within the . exclusive power of the Dis
trict Attorney and the -Augean stables
remain uncleaned, the people of tha
city cannot doubt who is responsibla
for failure. .'JEM
"It is with very great regret that I
find myself unable to proceed further
with you in these cases. The assump
tion of other official duties, of which
you aro aware, will prevent me. I have
taken very great interest in the cases,
because I have acquired absolute con
fidence in the sincerity of your pur
pose and In your pluck, and I have a
strong desire that the city of Philadel
phia, whose history and good name are
so dear to every American, shall be re
lieved from the strain, which a cor
rupt and criminal combination mas
querading under the name of Republi
cans have put upon her.
"I wish you godspeed in your fur
ther efforts. Very sincerely yours,
"ELIHU ROOT."

WEDDING
HAS TOUCH
OF ROMANCE
Mrs. Henry Mc-
Lean Martin a
Bride Again.
Marries J. B. Dahlgren
of Washington, D. C.
at St. Francis.
Match Is a Great Surprise to
Friends of Daughter
ofD.D. Colton.
Ban Francisco society received a genu
ine surprise last evening when the tele
phones transmitted about town the news
that Mrs. Henry McLean Martin, the
widowed daughter of the late General D.
D. Colton, and John B. Dahlgren, a
young attorney of Washington, D. C,
had been quietly married at 9 o'clock in
the St. Francis HoteL That this bit. of
news should cause more than an ordinary
ripple of excitement is easily explained
by the fact that not the slightest intima
tion of the approaching ceremony had
been given to any one beyond the mem
bers cf Mrs. Martin's family and her at
torney, and even the management of the
6t. Francis Hotel was kept in ignorance
of it until the last moment.
The wedding ceremony was performed
In the apartments of Mrs. Martin and
was devoid of all display, beyond a few
floral decorations, the simplicity being
due probably to the fact that Mrs. Martin
burled her mother In this city only three
weeke ago. Of the few who attended the
wedding, the most conspicuous were:
Mise {Catherine Martin, Mr. and Mrs.
Frank J^ Grace, John F. Boyd and Mr.
and Mrs. W. J. Bartnett. Bride and
groom were unattended and Immediately
after the wedding the bridal party ad
journed to private apartments in the ho
tel, where a wedding supper was served.
FIRST MET IX WASHIAGTO.V.
Last evening's affair was the culmina
tion of an Interesting romance, dating
back several years to the formal intro
duction of Mr. and- Mrs. Dahlgren at one
of Washington's social functions, at
which both were favored guests. Dahl
gren, who is many years his bride's
Junior, athleticaliy built and of pleasing
manners, is a grandson of the late Ad
miral Dahlgren and follows the profes
sion of law in the national capital, where
he has been engaged for several years
directing the legal affairs of the estate
cf an aged relative.
Dahigren'6 first meeting with Mrs. Mar
tin was followed by subsequent meetings
fn Paris, where his future bride was
wont to epend a great deal of her time,
but. notwithstanding the fad that they
were often seen together, their friends
little suspected that the acquaintance
would eventually ripen into a love affair.
Three weeks ago Mrs. Martin returned to
Ban Francisco with the remains of her
late mother, Mrs. Colton, who died last
February in Washington, leaving an
estate estimated to be valued at about
$750,000. The interment of Mrs. Colton's
body had hardly been accomplished be
fore a sensational suit was filed against
lire. Martin in Santa Cruz by Seigfried
Bacher of Paris, husband of the late
Helen Eaeher, Mrs. Colton's granddaugh
ter.
RECALLS UECEXT SUIT.
The plain tilt's action was brought on
behalf of his daughter, Helen Marquerlte
Beatrice Sacher. the 6-year-old great
granddaughter of Mrs. Colton, and al
leged that undue Influence had been ex
erted by Mrs. Martin over her feeble
mother to persuade the latter to draw
her will In favor of the married daugh
ters and to omit provisions for Sacher
and the great-grandchild, except in the
cam of tIOOO bequeathed to the little girl.
In this suit John B. Dahlgren" s name
was conspicuously linked with that of
Mrs. Martin and her attorney, W. J.
BartnetL The complaint boldly charged
that W. J. Bartnett drew up Mrs. Colton's
will and with the Â«onsent and knowledge
of Mrs. Martin inserted his own name as
executor for the benefit of himself, John
B. Dahlgren and the other legatees.
Bacher further alleged In his complaint
that Mrs. Martin had wrongfully repre
sented to Mrs. Colton that his child had
been amply provided for in Its mother's
will, which had bequeathed her $60,000,
whereas the father asserted that the
daughter had only received $8000.
BRIDE'S THIRD ADVEVTURE.
When John B. Dahlgren arrived here
Sunday and registered quietly at the St.
Francis Hotel, to which Mrs. Martin
had preceded him, and where, strangely
enough, Sacher Is also staying, it was
generally supposed by the few who
knew him and had* noted his presence in
the hotel â¢ that- his coming was In re
sponse to tho suit brought by Sacher.
But once eince Sunday did the vaguest
hint go forth of a possible marriage and
that was early yesterday forenoon,
when a prominent clubman, more 'in
Joke than seriousness, suggested that
Dahlgren was acting the part of an ar
dent suitor, whereupon one of Mrs. Mar
tin's friends promptly denied that there
Vere any grounds for such an insinua
tion and the joking clubman apologized
for his remark.
' These same clubmen were seated to
gether in their, club last evening, when
the first news cf the marriage at the St'
Francis Hotel was conveyed to them over
the telephone, and ' the man who had

SWIM NIAGARA'S
LOWER RAPIDS
C. D. Graham, Who Lives
Near Falls, and W. J. Glover
of Baltimore Perform Feat
NIAGARA FALLS, July 17.â Carlisle D.
Graham of this city and William J. Glov
er Jr. of Baltimore successfully swam the
lower r&plas of the Niagara from the
American side of the whirlpool to Lewis
ton this afternoon. The distance of four
miles was covered in twenty-six minutes
by Glover. The start was made at 4:02
p. m. from Flatrock, which is on the
American Bide. The swimmers did not
venture in the uppftr rapids, where Cap
tain Webb lost his life.
Both men wore life belts and Inflated
rubber rings around thÂ«lr neck 9. From
thÂ« starting Glover took the lead. He
entered the rapids & minute ahead of
Graham. Until the Devils Hole was
reached the swift current and roaring
rapids had the swimmers in their grasp.

Glover and he was down nearly two min

by this time had gained on Glover and
when the two men reached the end of the
rapids just above the suspension - bridge
at Lewlston there was but a little dis

swlft/smooth current was hard for
Graham, but evidently easy for Glover.
At 4:23 o'clock Glover was pulled up on
the dock at Lewiston. He was dressed

Graham had swam the lower rapids

NEW YORK, July . 17.â More than 100,
000 Italians to-day congregated, in the
"Little Italy" of Harlem to celebrate the
feast of "Our Lady of Mount Carmel."
They came from as far east as Boston
and as far west , as Plttsburg. From
thirty miles around New York Italians
came on foot, many of them barefoot as
a still great penance.
All day was spent In seml-rellglous fes
tivities. About the colony were scattered
altars of wood and tinsel before whicn
Italians knelt in the streets and on which
many of them laid wax . reproductions
of fingers', limbs or other parts of the
body which the prayer to the saint
would heal. At a street parade the rear
end was made "up of ' barefooted women
and children carrying candles, melting
under the combined heat of their own
light and the sun. Candles, many of
which were expensive , importations from
Italy, were an important part of the fes
tival and It is estimated that more than
seven tons of them were used to-day.
Hundreds of pilgrims from out of town
were forced to- live in the streets and 300
patrolmen were detailed to preserve or-

Of a sensational nature was offered to
day at the hearing which 1b being con

The evidence presented to-day consisted
of sixty-seven expense bills taken from
the local offices of the Southeastern Mis

had been altered and the rest duplicated
and even triplicated with the result that
the Louisville shipper was given an al
kged advantage of 3 cents per hundred
pounds over competitors selling grain in

The hearing was instituted on complaint
of shippers of grain from | St. Louis and
other Mississippi and Ohio river points,
who charged. that Louisville shippers, by
manipulating expanse bills, either with or
without knowledge on the part of the
railroads were securing lc-wer rates to
southeastern territory than "other points

the nature of this" communication,
which is regarded in the light of a con

them. They relate in minute detail the
precise manner in which the official re
port was tampered, with; who took

ing a common plane of understanding.
Their opinions as , to the best methods
to be pursued differ materially In cer

DROWNING GIRL SAVED
BY THREE PUGILISTS
Corhett, Attell and Shay Fig

~ . ;. hattan Beach.
Special Dispatch to Ths Call.
NEW YORK. July 17.â Ref. Henry
Newy of New Rochelle and his daughter.
Agnes, visited Manhattan Beach this aft
ernoon and the young woman went in
bathing., Abe Attell. Young Corbett
and Willie Shay were strolling along the
beach when suddenly Miss Xewy cried
that she could not ,swim and. was sink
ing. The men . were some distance from
the water, but there, was no mistaking
call for aid. Corbett was first to reach
the young woman, who was then strug
gling in the water over -her head. He
did not even remove his coat and as soon
as he reached her side, he was grabbed
around the neck and the pair sank to
gether.
It was then that Attell and Shay took
a hand. They went into the water with
all their clothes on and In a few min
utes succeeded in getting the other two
ashore. A great crowd gathered on the
beach, and Miss Newy and her father
were profuse in their thanks to the trio.
The Rev. Mr. Newy even invited the three
to visit him in New Rochelle.
Attell, .Young Corbett and Shay took a
closed carriage to the city and made some
quick changes into dry clothes and to
night they were looking as fit as ever. .
Missouri's Lead and Zinc.
Missouri claims in its zinc and lead
deposits more niineral wealth than the
gold deposits of -California or Colo
rado., While $700,000,000 worth of these
materials has been, taken out, it is as
serted'that their development has only
begun. .The State's yield- In these
minerals... ulone is claimed to have
: been greater than the total 'product
of; Colorado. It produces 80 percent
of all the zinc and 90 per cent' of all
the nickel mined In the United States,
while its relative position as to lead
is nearly the same. In addition to the
Joplin district, in Southwest Missouri,
a ne.wjfleld is being developed in Wash
ington County, within sixty miles of
St. Louis, which is claimed to be quite
as rich, if not more so, in zinc and lead
than thÂ« former. Notwithstanding the
largÂ« output of these minerals." the
demand for them seems to grow stead
ily with tha supply. This should stim
ulate the development of the fields in
Southwestern Kentucky, which grive
promise of being both rich and widely

JAPANESE SECRECY ABOUT
HOW THEY BEAT RUSSIAXS
Tueir Attitude Indicates That They
Expect More Pltrhtln? In
the Future.
Naval experts have awaited with more
than common interest the additional de
tails of the Japanese attack on the Rus
sian fleet in the Korean Strait. Nothing
has come through the newspaper dis
patches to enlighten them, and it is be
lieved that the officers will have to con
tent themselves with whatever may leak
out and come by way of the mail. There
is the hope, also, that our naval officers
en tl\e Asiatic station will be able to
pick cp information, especially those who
come in contact with the Russians at
Manila. There is much curiosity as to
how the Russian ships were sunk. It is
nothing short of a revelation to the
world if the Japanese succeeded in doing
this by gun fire, although it now ap
pears that the Japanese have been for
â¢erne time in the habit of going to north
ern waters, ostensibly for cruising pur
poses, but really to fire their guns. Lit
tle or nothing has been known of this
work. While other nations have been
comparing notes as to the percentages of
hits, the Japanese have been maintaining
an unbroken silence respecting their own
achievements with the heavy guns. This
jrust have been the cause of the Jap
anese success, say some of the experts,
though it is also held by others that
nothing short of submarine attack could
feave sunk vessels planned as were some
-'.i" the largest of the Russian battleships.
There is little faith In the suggestion
that the submarine boat was used. It
Is believed that the most damage was
wrought by the submerged mine and the
torpedo. The effect of gunfire can be
estimated more accurately when the in
juries of the Japanese are known. This
information will not be forthcoming for
come time. If ever, In the Interest of the
cause of naval warfare. The Japanese
are understood ,to have a policy which
refuses Information to those who may
gome day profit by It in the disadvantage
of the Japanese.â New York Tribune.

B AKER'S NIPPON HEROINS
CAMILLE IN KIMONA.
"Heart of Geisha" Is
Presented at the
; Alcazar.
Juliet Crosby Very
Charming in the
Title Role. :
Morals Are Better
Suited to O.ther
Glimes.
And now "Camllle" in a kimono. Such
Is Mr. Colgate Baker's, play, "The Heart
of a Geisha," produced la3t night for the
first time anywhere at the Alcazar
Theater. Camille becomes a Japanese
geisha and Papa Duval a redhalreJ and
bluo-eyed sister of the American Ar
mand. The sister offers Camiuo San
money for the release of her brother, and
in the same old Gallic way Kohamma
San says: "Take batfii your gold." In the
same old way she also goes back to the
Comte de Vauville bar.dv. to .. save her
lover from herself. However, she much
more decently dies. It is not a cough that
carries her off, for Kohamma San, even
as Madame Butterfly, kills hersexf.
One la constrained to thin* what will
becomo of tho family here. Kohaxnma
San has embraced what Mr. Baker insists
upon as the "profession" oi a geisha in
order to save her people from want. One
Is never allowed to forcet this. In the
second act the brother of the lady comes
in. Kohamma San has done what Ca
mllle did and retired with her American
lover to the exclusion of the honorable
Nipponese. Master Arima Shintaro, a
small Japanese Jingo, otherwise a cadet
in a military school, comes in to rebuKe
her.
Says he: "You are getting too much
fond of the foreign style." -
Modestly Kohamma San replies that
"she likes foreigners."
Says t brother, virtuously indignant,
"You must remember that you are the
only support of the family."
' Kohamma replies that she gives all
her money to mother.
The brother says: "You could cer
tainly have made more money than you
have done this month if you had been
kind to your countrymen. We are the
coming race!" â he nourishes his cap
here. \u25a0\^>
"Why, Arima, what does this mean?"
says Kohamma.
"It means that I have become a manT
says the young gentleman.
Possibly the Japanese gentleman
spends more than the Japanese boy.
Certainly it was rather hard on him
that the "sole support of the family"
should be so oblivfous of the needs of a
naval cadet Possibly â but where In
topsy-turvydom is one among ethics of
this sort? And this happens to be fun
ny. From its very un-Amerlcanism and
upslde-downness it "happens to be funny.
But Mr. Baker's picturing of Japanese
immorals does, not always happen to
be funny. Morality Is a matter of lat
itude, some one has said. Given the
Japanese eye the first act of "The Heart
of a Geisha," say, would perhaps not
offend. Possibly It Is no more Immoral
than tho first act of "Zaza." But it has
the unpardonable misfortune to look
that way. It has the serious misfor
tune to look very much that way.
There are ways of handling: the Jap
anese teahouse and geisha festivals
with poetry and delicacy. These are
not the ways of Mr. Baker. The first
act takes place in a famous teahouse,
its chief characters, the famous geisha
Kohamma San â that a naval cadet In
forms one is as famous as General
Oyama, Admiral Togo â a senile old lib
ertine Professor Nottingham, a Japan
ese roue. Baron Sanda, and the hero,
Charlie Horton. . -
The hero's visit to the teahouse is
his first, and is made the subject of
raillery as delicately pointed as a shil
lelagh. But as I said before this may
be all right in Japan. It should stop
there. Sympathy is impossible in the
connection, and as undesirable. >
Teahouse life has before been pic
tured, as in "The Geisha." and with
something of the external poetry and
romance that all writers, from Pierre
Loti to Lafcadio Hearn, give to it. It
is claimed that Kohamma San is a fa
mous geisha of that class that most
nearly approximates to the Greek he
taira of the class from which three
of the Cabinet Ministers at Toklo have
married their wives. Miss - -iiet,Cros
by, who .has the role, has eminently
the refinement and esprit, necessary, to
its best exposition. So: far" Kohamma
San becomes convincing. . '' â¢
But where are the statesmen, the poets,
the warriors supposed to be the constant
associates of her kind? Not a glimpse of
the splendor and possible poetry of the
situation is afforded one.' The geishas
pictured are' a rude and noisy crowd on
the whole, lacking wholly in dignity and
llkeableness. It is a play that s'houll
please the Russians!' ' _'\u25a0 '
On the other hand there are,' as - in
"Camllle," plenty of effective dramatic
situations. Interesting- incidents." and
genuine humor. The pictures ;of the
play are charming;, the'. lnterest*- holds
to the end; -the actors give a perform

Aged 3rrs. Irwin Is Felled
by Mnrderous Blow : and
Her Skull Is Eractured
STEALS UP BEHIND HER
Victim Crawls to a Saloon
arid Falls in Faint, With
Blood Flowing From Gash
Mrs. "; Ellen Irwin, aged 60 years, was
assaulted by a robber last night in front
of her^ home; nears Harbor View as_ she
was .returning ,: from the grocery, r ahd
her skull was fractured, , so seriously that
little hope is entertained for her recovery.
"When; she -was struck from behind by
the cowardly thugs she cried out several
times and 'her assailants fled without get
ting-any plunder. "She had $12 75 on her
person. The injured woman, bleeding
from a huge gash in her scalp, crawled
on hands and; knees to Duffy's saloon at
thb . corner \of c Beach and Baker streets
and there fell in a faint on the floor,
tlit re fell jin a faint on the lloor.
Mrs. Irwin, who conducts a small chick
en business at 231S Ueach street, left her
1 ouse , about i> o'clock to '\u25a0. go -to a grocery
five blocks away, i; As she reached
the sidewalk in trent of. her house on
her ; return, she was felled from , behind.
She was struck by some blunt Instrument.
She heard r no' one approach her and did
not realize sha was about to be assault
ed. As she fell bleeding to the ground
the fiend or fiends struck her again, f uli
in the face, fracturing the malar bone."
The malar bone,, or ""cheek bone,", ;i3
one of the strongest bones in the body
and only by a very hard, blow can. it be
fractured. Dr. George Herzog, who at
tended her, expressed grave doubts of her
recovery on account of her age. Mrs. Ir
win) rallied and regained consciousness
after being placed in bed.*
From" Duffy's saloon Mrs. Irwln was
sent to the hospital. " No, search was made
by the North End police for the assail
ant. '\u25a0\u25a0 The. detective station was notifkd
by Corporal Adams some time after the
assault, giving the thugs ample time to
make. their escape.
Mrs. Irwin is reputed to have consider
able money,' profits from her chicken
ranch, and this is thought to have been
the incentive for the J murderous assault.
Mra. Irwin is a widow. '
WONDERFUL MONSTERS
OF THE OCEAN DEPTHS
Unfamiliar Marine Giant* of -Im
mense Slxe and Hideous
Aspect.. -
Of all the' big game of the deep' sea
that have been taken by. man, the cutue
fish are the moat diabolical In shape and
general appearance. I have handled and
measured one that was thirty-eight feet
in: length, a weird, spider-like creature
with; two antennae-UXe arms tthifty feet
in , length.*; Specimens of these animals
have been caught seventy feet in length,
the" captors fighting 'them with an ax,
cutting the arms which seized and held
the boat: Off the coasts of California and
Alaska there is a deep sea ally of this
animalâ a big, spider-like octopus thai
haunts the deep banks, preying upon the
fishes most esteemed by fishermen. It Is
found" off the Farallpnes on ;the rocky
bottom, and at timea the fishermen haul
in' their, lines, thinking that they have
fouled a st(*ie or rock, so heavy Is the
weight ; but when the surface [ Is reached,;
long, livid I arms shoot j above the water,
seize the ; boat and the men are forced
to fight. '/with knives and hatchets the
weird, uncanny game that has a radical
spread of thirty feet, its eight sucker
lined- arms : being fifteen feet In length
and possessed of extraordinary power.
A specimen taken off the Island of San
Clemente had a' spread of about twenty,
feet, and gave the' boatman, a hard bat-,
tie to sever Its flying arms. Nothing
more diabolical can be conceived than
this spider-like giant of the deep sea,
living among the rocks 600 to 1000 feet
below the surface. Ah Individual of mod
erate -size v which I kept alive , displayed
the greatest pugnacity. '. The moment I
approached it would literally hurl Itself
at ray arm, winding "Its long, tentacles
about it In a manner suggestive of what
a large Individual might do; indeed. Dr.
A S. Packard, professor of' zoology- at
Brown University,, says: "An Indian
woman at Victoria, Vancouver Island, In
1877. was seized and. drowned by an octo-;
pus * probably of this species, while bath
ipg on the shore. : Smaller specimens on
coral reefs sometimes seize collectors or
natives, , and .fastening to them with
their ' relentless suckered ; arms,- tire and
frighten -to death the hapless victim."â

AVHICII WOULD YOU,
r -;.V . RATHER PART WITH
Relative alnen ot Thumb and Flncen
, am . Figured in- Various
\u25a0 .; . .Countries.
The Thumbâ The different fingers arÂ«
far from having the same value with
reference to* their functional utilization.
Much. the most important te'the thumb,
for without It prehension would be very
Imperfect. ; The hand Is no longer pin
cers, but merely a claw, when deprived
of the thumb. It may be estimated that
the thumb represents fully, a third of the
total value of the -hand. The total loss
of the thumb Is estimated by Brouardel.
secretary of the Boclete le Medecine
I-egale, as 15 to 35 per cent for the right
and 10 to 15 per cent for the left hand,
except for.- workers in art,' when he esti
mates 40 to 50 for the right and 25 ' to 40
per cent for the left hand. The Austrian
schedule gives 15 to 25 per cent. * In Ger
many 20, 23 and up to 33.5 . per cent has
been awarded.; On account of the great
difference resulting in our opinion from
the u?o of both hands, we prefer, In' the
professions not requiring special hand
skill, 30 per cent for the right and 20 per
cent for the left: ~ The percentage la
based on 100 as the total industrial value
of the hand . previous to the accident,
a loss of 60 per cent representing half of
that Value and^a. loss of 25Der cent one
fourth, etc.
The Index Finger.â The total loss of
the index finger causes an Incapacity es
timated at 10 to 15 per cent in Austria:
16 to 20 per cent; in Germany; 15 to 25 per
cent by Thlersch; 20 per cent for the
right and 15 per cent for: the left by tha
Italian courts; 15 per cent by the French
tribunals; 10 to 15 per cent for the right
and '<\u25a0 5 ti> \ 15 : per cent for \. tho left by
Brouardel. . except, for -workers in art.
These figures difTer but Jlttle from one
another.: and the figures from 10 to 20
per cent, according to the side, may be
adopted.- SsesÂ«fcÂ«-Â«*'
The Middle Finger.â The total loss of
the middle finger Is regarded by Gole
blewskl as often ;- more prejudicial than
that of- the' Index; this Is an Isolated
opinion; almost all the authorities ascribe
less Importance to the middle finger than
to the Index. Yet a great loss of force
Is observed In the hand when the finger
Is amputated. The following .are esti
mates: The Austrian tariff. 5 /to 10 per
cent; Brouardel. 5 to 15 per cent, except
for workers In art; Thlersch. 1 10 to 20 per
cent ; the , Italian law. 5'5 ' per cent. The
figures 8 to 12 per cent often are nearest
the truth.
The annular s (ring) finger is the . least
Important. Its total loss often does not
cause Incapacity. The Austrian tariff as
similates this \, finger to . the middle one.
Brouardel estimates the loss at 5 to 10 per
cent; the \ ltalian law, \ 8 per cent. The
French and German Judicial decisions are
often In accord in refusing Indemnity,
considering the Incapacity resulting from
the loss as very. slight.
The auricular (little) .finger may be
compared to the -annular, except In . the
professions tn' which it serves as a point
of support for. the hand.â New York Sun.

MUST BEGIN
OVER AGAIN
ALBANY, N. T., July 17.â ThÂ« Assem
bly to-night spent nearly the whole even
ing in coming to the conclusions that its
proceedings In reference to- the allega
tions in the New York Press of "a "big
lobby." "Boodle" and improper political
Influences in the Hooker case had thus
far been in excess of the joint session. The
final decision was that the case of Editor
Wardman and his assistants on the New
York Press moat begin all over again
under at least a new form of subpena.
Interest centered In the report that the
Legislature leaders would attempt the
punishment of Editor Wardman for his
refusal to answer 'questions for the ex
pression of his belief that Improper In
fluences were at work In behalf of Jus
tice Hooker. No such attempt was made
for the very Jurisdiction of the session

RECE3TT ART PURCHASKS
BY J. PIERPONT 3IORGAS
He la Said to Intend Acquiring; a Mil
lion Dollar*' "Worth Before
Brtnstnff Any Home.
The recent purchase In England by J.
Plerpont Morgan of a single canvas for
$45,000 was a portrait by Raeburn of his
wife. The picture Is no doubt genuine,
but unfortunately . his sitter was an un
prepossessing woman of over S9 and the
canvas is not a striking one. Edlnboro
In Raeburn's time was a place for
portraiture. Raeburn painted most of the
men â and .women â of his time and hard
ly an eminent Scot but sat for him, and
his work may be said to have mirrored
over a quarter century of the nation's
life. 9
The modern American may learn this
lesson from this olden time Scotâ he was
content to paint what he knew and he
went not far afield for either subject or
enthusiasm.
The portrait Just bought will be placed
In Mr. Morgan's London gallery, and will
not be brought to America until tho tariff
be lifted. Â»
It has been said that Mr. Morgan was
waiting to purchase $1,000,000 worth of
pictures before bringing 'any home and
to then endeavor to get them by the
Custom-house free of duty on the ground
that the pictures are to be hung In a
gallery where the public will be invited.
But Mrs. Jack , Gardner of Boston has
tried this same scheme, and has paid
nearly half a million dollars to the Gov
ernment for duties-- During the last year
her personal check- was drawn for $195,000.
So there seems lttle likelihood \u25a0of tha
plan working, In Mr. Morgan's : favor.
.The exportation of ostriches from South
Africa has practically been prohibited by
an export tax of $48? each. Intended to
preserve In that country far as possi
ble the monopoly of the lucrative trada
of ostrich farming.

CLEANING PLAN
Mayor Inaugurates Scheme
for Permanent Repair and
Renovation of Highways
DISTRICTS ARE FORMED
Explains That 'for Thirty
Days or So Work Will Be
Along Experimental Lines
OAKLAND, July 17.â Mayor Motts"
plan for permanent street repair and
cleaning: by a district system was put in
operation to-day under direction of the
Superintendent of Streets.
For experimental purposes two districts
hayÂ« been created. The first lies betweeji
Broadway, Lake, Merritt. Seventh street
ar.d the northern boundary of the city.
The second is bounded by Sei .nth,
Broadway, Twenty-second and Adeline
streets. Each district is In charge of a
foreman with a force of twelve men and
two carts.
In view of the many inquiries made by
residents concerning the district plan,
Mayor Mott to-day issued the following:
Tfcer* wni to bÂ« a tittle misunderstanding
by Â»(*nie of the property owners of the city In
rerarti to two combination repairing and clean
ing panes that hayÂ« been put to work this
morning on the streets. The two crews In
question are merely an experiment In order to
ascertain the number of men that can be used
to the best advantage In a certain given area,
and the coet of keeping the sane clean and
in repair. It ia estimated that by August 1
the Board of Pobllc Works will have suffi
cient data on the subject to enable it to intel
ligently lay the whoie city out into districts
and to know Just how many men will be
needed tn each, particular one, which will re
sult in the work I* ingr done econonilcally and
satisfactorily. It will thus be seen that every
section of the city will receive *<]ual attention
under this eyetem, and the mere ejection of
two Rnall districts of the city in which to In
augurate the same and test Its efficiency does
not meaa that come particular parts of Oak
land will be favored.
Malcolm Lamond, Superintendent of the
Bureau of Public Works, has decided to
begin work at once on the improvement
of Independence Square, a long neglected
plaza in East Oakland. The plat at Sec
ond avenue and East Eighteenth street
will next receive attention. Following
that will be the improvement of Bush
rod Park in North Oakland.

BERKELEY. July 17.â Gianni Oreno.
a shoe merchant at 3214 Adeline street,
whose shop was the ccene of attempted
arson yesterday morning, was arrested
this morning at his place of business by
Town Marshal Vollmr after a search of
twenty-four hours for him. â¢
Oreno was taken to the County Jail,
but late this afternoon was escorted to
Berkeley, where he was under Inves
tigation by Vollmer and Fire Chief
Kenny. ; After a conference with the
insurance agents, who bad placed an
TSOd policy on Oreno's stock several
weeks ago, the suspected man was re
leased. The officials said the evidence
was insufficient to warrant the swear
ing out of a warrant against Oreno, al
though suspicion very strongly pointed
toward him. Oreno denied all knowl
edge concerning the fire. He declared
ttoe left his store Saturday evening and
Remained In San Francisco over Sunday,
returning to Berkeley this morning.
The officers were unable to find evi
dence that would break down Oreno's
statements as to his whereabouts. The
case will be further investigated.

MAT OPEN A PRIVATE
SCHOOL TO EVADE LAW
STOUTLY OPPOSE VACCINATION
Parents in League Look on Project
in Very Favorable Light.
| BERKELEY, July 17.â Citizens of Berke
| ley who oppose the compulsory vacci
\u25a0 nation law are thinking of opening a pri
vate school where the law can be ignored
and respect enforced to the desires or
parents who will not permit their chil
dren to be vaccinated. The plan has the
informal sanction of the Anti-C6mpulsory
Vaccination League of Berkeley. This
league was organized a year ago at a
mass-meeting held in Odd Fellows' Hall,
v.hen the . following officers were elected:
President. Dr. Woodson Allen; secretary,
;Mrs. E. C. Campbell; treasurer, J. Stitt
Wilson. (
S The nucleus for the proposed anti-vacci
nation school is found in an institution
which Mrs. Mary T. Wilson has organ
ized. She was a tetcher iÂ»i the Lincoln
School until a few months ago, when the
Board of Education dropped her from >the
department. No reason was assigned,
but it was reported that Mrs. Wilson's
viewÃ on the subject of vaccination did
not please the majority of the board.
Mrs. Wilson has opened a private school
where no vaccination regulations are en
forced. It is understood that she will
have the backing of the Anti- Vaccination
League in her project.
J. Stitt Wilson said to-day: "I believe
an anti-vaccination school will be a great
success in Berkeley. The tuition fee
would be nominal, if the attendance was
large. I know that in the last year the
sentiment against vaccination has grown
in Berkeley. It is probable that most of
the 300 children excused last year upon
presentation of physicians' certificates to
the effect that the child should not be
vaccinated because of physical disability
will not come to school this year, now
that the Board of Education has decided
that such certificates will be void. They
vTAI have to be educated in some insti
tution, of course, and it is reasonable to
suppose that private anti-vaccination
schools will be favored by the parents of
such children."
HAPPY PAIR
WED 'NEATH
FLORAL BELL
OAKLAND. July 17.â Tha wedding of Miss
Ruth Bruce and Edwin Wold was solemnized
this evening In the chapel of the First Pres
byterian Church In tha presence of a hun
dred or more friends of the two families. The
young people of the Christian Endeavor So
ciety, of which the bride is a member, took
unto themselves the task of decorating the
marriage place and many a loving wish for
the happiness of their associate was woven
into the garUnds that gracefully draped the
walls. The ' rmall platlorm was a mass of
green, s-nd against the dark background an im
mense horseshoe of pink blossom besought good
luck for the young couple. Depending irom
the celling, a huge bell, at least four -feet In
diameter, was enwreathed with vines and pink
geranium blooms. Floral pillars outlined the
aisle throuÂ£lj which the bridal party passed.
The brld^^rvas gowned In a dainty, lacey
affair of white point d' esprit, trimmed with
elaborate ruchlngs of white ribbon and her veil
swept over all to the very edge of the round
ed train. A tiny wreath of orange blossoms
confined the veil and a bouquet of white rose*
formed the bridal bouquet, â¢ â¢'
Miss Winnie Bruce, the bride's sister and
her maid of honor, was becdmlngly attired In
pink organdie and carried sweet peas to match
her j-'own. Another and younger sister. Miss
Florence Bruc*. was flower bearer and, wear
ing a pretty frock of white dotted, swiss and
!&co, carried a basket of pink blossoms.
Little ' Ruth Bruce, all In white, bore the
ring on a white satin cushion.
Charles de Wolfe attended the groom and
the ushers were: Premiss Bee, Frank .Harris,
Koss Weit, Fred Scheirner, Chester Newell
and Harry Mills. Rev. E. E. Baker read the
marriage service.
The singing of the bridal march from Lohen
grin by Mrs. Alverson, as the wedding pÂ»rty
entered the chapel, was most effective. Men
delsohn's triumphant strains were played by
Miss Helen Wold as the newly married couple
made their way out. The ceremony waa fol
lowed by a email reception at ttre Bruce home
on Eleventh street, the two families and their
Immediate friends only being present.
Mr. and MrÂ«. Wold will sptnd their honey
moon in the south and on their return will re
side in Oakland, where the groom is engaged
in business. . , . ,\u25a0\u25a0..

BERKELEY, July > 17.â Announcement
was made at the university to-day that
its library has come into possession; of
the extensive and valuable manuscripts
of the late -Dr. Washington Matthews,
who was one of the foremost ethnologists
of the country and noted especially for
his work on the Nava jo and Hidatta
traditions and languages. The high
standard of his "Navajo- Legends" and
his "Night Chant, a.Navajo Ceremony,"
perhaps his greatest and best known
works, brought him wide recognition
among anthropologists and those inter
ested in the pre-history.of America every
where. During long years of residence
in the Navajo country he accumulated : a
large amount of Information; on the
language, ' religion, ceremonies and be
liefs of those Indians, which has never
been published/This includes a diction
ary of about 6000 words.
During the last few years Dr. Matthews
was connected .with-, the -.University.:: of
California through the liberality of Mrs.
Phoebe A. â¢ Hearst. By his death i. the
university has now come Into possession
of his Invaluable manuscripts.'. These

possible .published. The Navajos - belong
to the great Athabascan linguistic " : fam
ily, one of the most important and wide-,
spread in North America, to ; which the
Hupa of California and other; tribes also
belong. Dr. P. E. Goddard of the -uni

BARONET OFFERS TROPHY
FOR FOOTBALL MATCH
Yankees Given Chance to Meet Britishers
Special Dicpatch to The Call.
LONDON, July 17.â Sir Ernest Cecil
Cochrane, who has just offered to do
nate a hundred guineas ($525) cup to
be competed for by representative foot
ball teams from Great Britain, Ireland,
Canada and the United States, Is the
only titled representative of the great
temperance drink industry In f the
United Kingdom. He is the chairman of
Cantrell & Cochrane, the great Irish
firm.
"My object in offering this cup." he
said, "is to promote that healthy rivalry
in sport between the great branches of
the Anglo-Saxon race, which, I am con
vinced, counts for much in making them
6tanch friends. Whichever side wins, it
leads to a better acquaintance and a
growth of mutual appreciation. "We* 1
have international yacht races and row
ing matches and contests in various
branches of athletics, but football, one
of the healthiest and manliest of games,
which is played with great keenness on
both sides of the Atlantic, nas no place
as yet in these international competi
tions."
"That Is becayse the American and
English games are played In different
fashions," was suggested.
"Undoubtedly, but I don't think that
need constitute an insurmountable ob
stacle. A committee representing both
Etyles should be able to draw up rules
and conditions that would be fair to
â¢ach. We might get a combination of
the rules, or an arrangement to play a
eeries of games in which the two styles
alternate. But, of course, Ido not my
self lay down any conditions. There
\u25a0will be no string attached to the cup.
Two association teams are going to
Canada this autumn 'and later will
probably visit the United States and
give exhibition games there. That will
convince our American cousins, I hope,
that our game* relayed under what are
known as association rules, is by no
means so slow as it is commonly regard
ed in America. The fact that two teams
are going over affords an excellent op
portunity for. mooting the question of
an international football contest, and I
could think of no better way to start it
than by offering a cup to be played
for."
Sir Ernest is 32 years old and a grad
uate of Trinity College, Dublin. He
made a business tour of the United
States several years ago. He served in
a militia regiment for eleven years and
attained the rank of captain. He also
.etudled law and was admitted to the
tsar, but haÂ« never practiced the legal
profession. Recently he started a racing
Etud In Ireland and had the satisfaction
of winning the first three races for
which he entered. He has political am
bitions and will probably contest a
Parliamentary seat at the next general
election. In September he expects to
visit America, on a business trip, but he
\u25a0will not be too busy to talk about his
International football scheme.

JACK WELCH TO REFEREE BRITT SULLIVAN GO
BRITISH SPORTSMAN WHO HAS ]
OFFERED TROPHT FOR INTER
NATIONAL. FOOTBALL. MATCH.
IXTEREST IS COLMA FIGHT.
Kyan-Peterson Comteat Promises to Be
/ a Lively Affair.
The flght for the welter-weight
championship of the world, which will
be fought to-morrow night at Colma
between George Peterson and Buddy
Ryan, gives promise of being one of
the best the local "sports "have seen in
many a moon. Both men are the sort
who wade in and mix it when the bell
taps, and this sort of milling always
takes here.
Ryan rules a 2 to 1 favorite over the
champion of England and California.
He holds the world's title at the welter
limit now, and for this reason is looked
upon as outclassing the. local boy.
Ryan's long suit is an awful punch,
which generally brings home the coin
when it lands on the jaw or the solar
plexus.
Peterson will have the advantage of
reach, but that will be about all for
him. He has only fought two profes
sional contests in his life and there
fore will be lacking in experience. But
still* he managed -to make a chopping
block out of Clancy a few weeks ago,
when all the wise ones were' willing to
bet 2 to 1 that the English champion
would wade through the "terrible
Swede.
A big crowd is expected to
make the trip to Colma. The
advance sale of tickets has been large,
and the accommodations will be just
as good as in the last two contests
there, when the 'fans were whisked
back to this city by midnight * The
management has arranged for a whole
line of extra cars, which will be wait
ing outside when the fight is over.
Billy Roche will referee the mill, be
iner the official judge for the Golden
State Athletic Club. The preliminary
should be a good one. .\u25a0*
\u25a0 Jimmy Gardner, who is carded to flght
Ruf e Turner at Colma in the middle of
next month, ' did not arrrea. in this city
last night, though he was due. A dis
patch was received from him in which he
says he will be on hand this evening.' He
intends to get busy at his' training quar
ters Immediately, so he will be in shape
for the hurricane Stockton negro.
EXEAK THIEVES. AT WORK.â The pollcw

QUICKLY NAME
POTRERO MAN
Al Herford Gives In Without
More Parley and Conies to
Terms of Britt and Levy
FAST FIGHT EXPECTED
Plumber Boy Promises to; Be
a Heavy vFavorite in the
Bout Next Friday Evening
Jack Welch of the ;Â» Potrero was J last
night' named to reteree!the Britt-Sullivan
contest at Wood>vara's Pavilion next Fri
day night. ' Al Heriord knew- he nad tÂ«
give In, thoughup to the eleventh" noui
he stahed ana ( keu t' asking , for additional
lime. Welch seems agreeable lo^ ail par
ties concerned and aa jj he ,is the ottlcial
referee or the Ha^es Valley^Club|he
should ! prove satisfactory.
When the T matter of naming: the third
man in the ring came up last night Wil
lie Britt said Welch* si-i'ted :hinu and he
would like to" see : the Potrero , man in the
ring on Friday evening. Herford* smiled
and said Weich .looked awful good ; to
him and the matter was closed without
any undue ceremony on the part of the
rival managers.
It was a foregone conclusion on Sat
urday â¢ night that Welch would get, the
job of judging the bout.* HerfordV prob
â¢ably knew that there was no chance for
another to land, yet he stalled around
and asked for time in which to consider
the proposition/ Morris Levy, manager
of the Hayes Valley Club, was anxious
that the third man Jn the ring be named
several days ago and did hot like the
postponement a bit.
BOTH [CLEAN BOXERS.
Welch has not yet been asked whether
or not he will accept, -but it is a foregone
conclusion he will take the job. The task
of judging the coming bout should prove
an easy one, for both men are clean box
ers and used to doing what the referee
is wont to tell; them. Welch is as good a
man for the job as couid be secured and
last night's choice should certainly/ suit
every one interested in the nstic game."
Interest in the coming fight is beginning
to be awakened' rapidly as the contest
draws near. The training, quarters of the
rival boxers have been thronged .with
interested sports .during the last. week.
Sullivan is an unknown quantity in this
city and for that reason a big house will
probably turn out to see him perform
here for the first time. â¢*-
There 'has been little or no. betting on
the outcome of the contest thus far.
Britt's record stands out in bold relief
alongside that of the Washington lad,
offering quite a contrast. The ; price
opened up the other day at 10 -to B,< but
only a few wagers were made, at ' these
odds. It is likely the real betting will
start at 10 to 7 and.be hammered down
to 10 to 6 or 2 to 1 when the men enter
the ring. _ \u25a0..â¢\u25a0â¢\u25a0'â¢.-\u25a0. . â¢â¢ ' â¢ \
SULLIVAN GROWING SPEEDY.
That Sullivan has improved in his work
since he took up the burden three weeks
ago is admitted by V every one ' who has
seen him perform. The lad managed '.to
develop quite a burst of speed lately and
his handlers say he will surprise the local
sports by his cleverness when 'he puts \u25a0up
his mitts against Britt '- 4 â¢"'*
Britt's work Is â¢as good as \u25a0 completed.
He can make the weight any time he
chooses now. The plumber boy never did
experience any difficulty in rounding Into
shape and this time things were as easy
as ever for him. During 'his present
siege of training Jimmy has paid more
attention to doing a lot: of ! rough work,
such as wrestling and pulling his ' train
ers about. He saw the value of this sort
of thing when he met Nelson and as Sul
livan is reputed to be one of those rough
fighters, Britt intends to ". be prepared to
stand a long and tiresome grueling. â¢ \

A UNIVERSAL DISEASE
.Catarrh nsnally begins" with fa cold in .

the ears have a ringing or buzzing noise,
the throat becomes sore, "and as the un-

rates the blood a general feeling of des-
pondency takes possession of the system.

ri'BLICATION OFFICE THIRD AND MARKET STREETS. BAN FRANCISCO
TUESDAY â¢..JULY 18. 1905
ATTACKING A PROFESSOR.
AT the Taft banquet Professor Moses of the Berkeley Uni
versity and former Philippine Commissioner sat by Senator
Patterson of Colorado. The two conversed and after it
was over Senator Patterson informed a reporter that Professor
Moses had said that American workingmen get too high wages.
At least that is what Patterson was said to have told the reporter,
and it was promptly published and was as promptly followed by a
number of very hot attacks upon Professor Moses.
It is not necessary to characterize the conduct of Senator
Patterson if he repeated to a reporter any part of a gentleman's
conversation had under, such circumstances. True, there is no
clement of the confidential in the talk that goes on at a banquet,
but it has that freedom which exists in the belief that only gentle
men are present and that only the speeches are to be reported, and
that the conversation is under the same rules as that between the
guests at a gentleman's table. - -\u25a0\u25a0 ~-
When Professor Moses felt the heat of the roasting that fol
lowed the publication he explained that in conversation with the
Senator a certain well-known economic law was stated to the effect
that a high-wage country attracts immigrants from .the low-wage
countries, and if this continues long and the number of immigrants
be large enough the effect is to raise wages in the countries they
desert and lower wages in that, to which they go. This results in
bringing about an equalization of wages. - Inasmuch as this is the
statement of a natural law that any one can comprehend, it is
strange that Senator Patterson found in it only the statement that
American wages are too high and hastened to blow his own horn
that it might be heard in far Colorado by repeating his construction
of what the professor said. ;
The Call has been pointing out that same law for the benefit
of those interested. The labor organizations have published that
a large number of our people are out of work and those affected
by this are variously estimated to number from five to ten millions.
Into such an industrial condition we have received in the last year
one million immigrants from Europe. Does any one believe that
wages can be maintained under such circumstances? Already the
effect is being felt.
There are two ways in which the economic law stated correctly
by Professor Moses works to its end. One is by gradual reduction
of the money wage and the other is by decline in its purchasing
power. The latter is already in operation; high wages means high
cost of production, and that means high rent and an advance in the
price of the necessaries of life.
At the banquet Senator Flint announced himself opposed to
free trade. Granting that he meant free trade in merchandise, his
attention is invited to the problem involved in the attempt to hold
wages up by obstructing the introduction of the products of cheap
labor and at the same time admitting the cheap labor itself. If
admission of the products tends to equalize the world's wages, so
will admission of the labor. Senator Flint also opposes Chinese
immigration. Last year 259 Chinese entered the country, against a
million European immigrants. Why strain at 259 Chinese and swal
low a million of Southeastern Europeans ?
We notice that the affair has been seized upon by certain ele
ments in the State that oppose the university, and volunteer spokes
men are decrying the institution. The great trouble that afflicts
this world is that so Sew seem to know what Dr. Jordan says
is the sum of human klowledge, that a straight line is the shortest
distance between two points. That means that natural law is the
supreme law of the universe, and railing at Professor Moses because
he has stated a natural law is about as sensible as to scour a kettle
to remove the spots on the sun.
SUPERVISION OF LIFE INSURANCE.
THERE is a brief study of life insurance in the latest number
of the North American Review, made by S. Herbert Wolfe,
who is a consulting actuary in New York, a frequent con
tributor to technical papers and magazines and a fellow of the
Royal Statistical Society and of the American Statistical Associa
tion. The great importance of this institution to civilization is
*ho\vn by him and the necessity of Government supervision is
pointed out from the standpoint of an expert. /
The wide publicity given to the internal troubles of the New
York Equitable makes this a timely paper. It is good as giving
emphasis from an authoritative source to the magnitude and use
fulness of the institution of life insurance and to the reasons for
supervision, but its chief value is to indicate the great responsi
bility attaching to the head of an insurance department.
Supervision we already have, but he would make it more thor
ough. He says that to expect a man trained in other walks of life
to develop suddenly into a competent supervisor is to ask the im
possible. He wishes the elimination of anything like political pull
in selections for the responsibility. The administration of insur
ance departments should be in the hands of men equipped by
training and education to protect the millions of policy holders.
This he looks forward to to be accomplished before another decade
passes. When the time of alert and competent supervision comes
"the funds of a life insurance company'will never be regarded as a
means whereby one group of financiers may profit at the cost of
another group."
The evil complained of, namely, the putting of insurance com
.missioners into office and the removal of them from office for
political reasons and consequent on elections, thus making tenure
and experience short, is said to be found in nearly every State in
this country. The exceptions are the New England States, where
many of the commissioners have held their positions for long
periods and thus by experience are able to betjter safeguard the
interests of the policy holders. In speaking of tne details of good
management of insurance companies he mentions that one of the
safest and most desirable investments a company can make is loans
to its policy holders, not exceeding the reserve which is main
tained on their policies. : , ;*^s : /.

There have been many suggestions of variations from the traditional
champagne used in christening American warships ranging from spring
water to beer, but popular opinion in Vermont seems to be gravitating to"
a common focus upon maple syrup as the right beverage with which to
christen the battleship Vermont. Maple syrup, it seems, is the most typical
beverage which the State produces, and there is a local feeling that the
State should furnish its christening fluid from home resources. â Baltimore

VIEWS OF REST
AND SLEEP.
"I am told. Mr. Edison," said an ac
quaintance to the great inventor one day,
"that you sleep but five or six hours out
of the twenty- four. How do you do so
much work on so little sleep?"
"So little sleep?" isked Edison, whim
sically. "Why, sir, I iget lots of sleep.
In those five or six hours I get all the
sleep I've paid for, and that's a good
deal."
It is due partly to this view of rest and
sleep that Thomas' A. Edison has been
able to do so exceptional an amount of
valuable work for the world, says a
writer in the Chicago Tribune. A prom
inent lecturer, speaking In Chicago re
cently, made the assertion that every
man, woman and child should spend one
third of his or her time in" unbroken,
dreamless sleep. A vigorous old gentle
man in the audience was heard to whis
per to his neighbor, "That's an eight
hour law I'm agin." So has many an
other vigorous old gentleman, including
some of the world's greatest men, been
agin" the taking of sleep according to
the rule of three.
In contrast to this type Is the young
man who, when roused from a nap by his
employer In an hour of duty, tried to
guard against reprimand by saying, with
a painful effort to control his thick
tongue: "I just thought I owed a little
something to myself, you know." Yes,
every man does owe something to him
self, but that something Is hardly the
taking of sleep in the hour of work.
I once knew two delicate I old women
whoj being advised by their physicians to'
take as much sleep as possible,* gradually
cultivated the art of sleeping about six
teen hours a day. So faithfully \u25a0 and
hopefully did they follow their doctor's
Instructions in regard to the "rest cure.
that within a year one. died of heart
trouble and the other of softening of the
brainâ diseases which they were not
known to have at the beginning of the
treatment. The fact that they required
broad coffins and were heavy burdens
for the pall bearers is no recommenda
tion for the "rest cure."
A false theory leads many a man into
the evils of the "rest habit.". A certain
overworked business man, believing he
was on the verge of nervous prostration;"
fled to the coast for a vacation and rest.
After a two weeks' stay he felt as well
as he ever had, but decided to^stay a
v.-hile longer "to put on the
touches," as he told himself. After two
weeks more, having , gained five pounds,
he conceived an* ambition to grow fat, so
he wrote to his partner that he would
stay a month longer and "store up en
ergy for the year's business." "Confound
your stored up energy," wrote his part
ner in reply. "The business don't need
stored up energyâ it- needs more- energy
that's on tap, and, needs it quick." The
vacationer returned, but it took him sev
eral days of blundering work to get the
cobwebs out of his brain.
The scientist who announced not long
since that he had discovered the germ
which produces the disease of laziness
may not have been wholly In error. But
doubtless the symptoms often come first
and the microbes afterwardâ by invita
tion. An educated hobo said to me once:
> "It takes a philosopher to understand
a man "like me. I want to do things, but
I just can'tâ the wires are cut. It'sVhell,
sirâ yes, hell." And the look of abject
melancholy in the - man's face lent con
viction to his "words. Hamlet was neither
the first nor the last character^ to cry
out in despair over his own Impotence.,

THE POET TACKLES SOCIETY.
//â ,HE society reporter is sick to
1 day," said the Managing Editor
, to the Office Poet, "and I guess
that' you will have to tackle her stunt.
Can you do it?" \u25a0 "
"Sure!" the Poet replied.
"You can see her," the Editor continued,
"and get her regular list of efflorescent
tributes and scintillating descriptions,
and after that It will be easy, andâ say!"
"Well?"
"If you would mix in a few of those
Inimitable little quatrains of yours they
probably would add to the attractiveness
of the report."
The Poet went away, and late that
night the City Editor hunted him up.
"How you getting along with those so
ciety reports?" he asked.
The Poet lifted his careworn counten
ance, and replied:
"Iâ well, I'm at work on the second
one." ;
"Got one done, have you?"
"Well. Iâ that isâ no, not exactly,
but- â " \-;i
. "Let me see what you've got."
The Poet handed over his manuscript,
and wiped the perspiration from his brow
while the Editor ran his practiced eye
over the account of the Blinks-Winks
wedding:
"The afternoon wedding of Miss Mac
Edythe Winks, whose papa's liquor em
porium is largely attended by the true
haut ton. and Mr. T. Augustus Blinks,
whose captivating form and lahdedah
mustache have been extensively admired
by the patrons of a well-known dry goods
caravansary, was an exclusively recherche
and tutti-frutti affair. All who have but
ted into" society were there, as well as
several who are merely trying to do so.
"As the young couple approached the
altar !t was generally noticed that^the
brides spirituelle countenance- waa light
ed by a winsome smile and the very best
complexion purchasable in the city. ,
"As when the dawn creeps down the land
To paint the skies with brightness o'er.
Or when a firefly lights his lamp
To show a skeeter where to bore.
"The lovely bride wore a dream of a
costume made of some sort of white
stuff,, with a kind of knob. of something
different standing out on it every once in
a while. There, were bars of something
darker down the front, with little dinky
Buffings along the edges of them. If was
generally agreed that it was a perfect
love of a gown. She wore a handkerchief
to match it. a very dainty , affair that
was much? admired until the groom
breathed hard and blew it away. The
groom was attired a good deal as men
usually are. Thus the fascinating young
couple stood before the altar:
"Two souls with but a single thought.
Two hearts that take the bun.
To prove a cipher and a naught
Wrun added may make one."
The City Editor paused in his reading,
and reached for a paper-weight.

COLLIXS READY FOR TUSSLE.
From all the reports from Victoria Col-
li:\3 is working desperately to prepare a
<Jefens<? to save himself from being
brought back to his native city to face the
chprge of perjury. The runaway lawyer
has made a careful 6tudy of the law of
Canada and he is prepared to take ad
vkntage of every technicality that the
cod** affords him. He has also studied in
every detail the indictment that was
brought against him at the last meet-
Ing of the Grand Jury in San Francisco.
and It is not unlikely that be will allege
tome flaw in that document and try to se
cure his freedom on the strength of the
possible mistake there. As a last resort
Collins has the appeal to the Privy Coun
cil and it is not unlikely that he will re-
Bon to this slight chance of freedom.
A telegram received from Victoria late
last night indicates that the witnesses of
the perjury will be required at the pre
liminary hearing in the north. It Is even
possible that Collins will be freed if those
witnesses 60 not reach! the border line In
time to testify to the alleged crime. The
telegram reads as follows:
WITNESSES MUST BE SEVT.

were gamboling about beyond.

"Wife MaAc Wise Chance lo Food.
Change of diet is the only way to
really cure stomach and bowel trouble.
A woman cays:
"My husband had dyspepsia when we
were married and had suffered from it
for several years. It was almost im-
possible to find anything: he could eat
without bad results.
"I thought this was larg-ely due to the
use of coffee and persuaded him to dis-
continue it. He did so. and began to
drink Postuin Food Coffee. The change
<31d him good from the beglnlng, his di-
K^stion improved; he suffered much lees
from his nervousness, and when he
added Grape-Nuts food to his diet he
was coon entirely cured.
"My friend, Mrs. - â - . of Vlcks-
burg (my former home), had become a
nervous wreck also from dyspepsia.
MeUkiuv-s had no effect, neither did
travel help her. On my last visit home,
so:r>.e months ago, I persuaded her to use
Grape-Nuts food. She was in despair,
and consented. She stuck to it until It
restored "her health so completely that
she is now the most enthusiastic friend
of Grape-Xuts that I ever knew. She
eats it with cream or dry. Just as it
tomes from the packageâ keeps it in
her room and cats it whenever she feels
like JL
"I began eating Grape-Nuts food my-
bcU when ray baby was two months old,
and 1 don't know what I should have
done without it. My appetite was gone,
1 was weak and nervous and afforded
but very little nourishment for j^ the
child. The Grape-Xuts food, of which I
soon grew very fond, , speedily set all
this right again, and the baby grew
healthful, rosy and beautiful as a moth-
er could wish. He is two years old now
und tats Grape-Xuts, food himself. I
wish evÂ«Â»ry tired young mother knew of
â¢the good that GrapeÂ»Nuts would do

Talk in Labor League Camp
of Nominating Michael
Casey for Mayor of City
To-morrow night registration will
close for the primary election of Au
gust 8. All citizens of San Francisco
who were not registered for the gen
eral election of 1904 and all who were
registered for that election and have
since changed their place of residence,
should register now. The main office
of registration, City Hall, McAllister
street entrance, will be open until a
late hour at night. Citizens who can
not conveniently call at the City Hall
during regular business hours may
register in the evening.
The number of voters registered yes
terday approximated 1200. It Is prob
able that 2000 will> register to-day and
3000 to-morrow. It is estimated that
the registration will reach 87,000. There
is a firm belief at headquarters of the
San Francisco Republican League that
the list ought to be corrected by cita
tions to 7000 persons who do not reside
at the places designated on the register.
The Republican League Club of the
Thirty-third Assembly District will
meet to-night at â¢ Silk's Hall. Precita
avenue, near Mission street, for the pur
pose of considering nominations for
delegates to the Republican municipal
convention. The committee of ten ap
pointed by the executive committee of
the league desire that the Republicans
of the district should suggest names In
order that a representative delegation
may be chosen at the primary election
on August 8. The meeting to-night
will be open to all Republicans of the
district.
The Union Labor party of the Thirty
first Assembly District organized a
Schmltz Club oaÂ» the 15th inst. J. B. Wil
liams was elected president. There is
talk in the camp of the Labor League in
favor of the nomination of Michael Casey
for Mayor. It is claimed that the tri
umph of Casey In the>Labor party would
relegate Ruef to the rear. Moreover, the
story goes that the Socialists, who are
organizing for the municipal campaign
and predicting that they will cast a
largely Increased vote, are ready to en
dorse the candidacy of Casey. It is
obvious to the wage workers that the
Union Labor County Committee is
dominated by Ruef.
Independent Republicans of the Thirty
eixth Assembly District met at 1909 Mis
sion street last Friday night and organ
ized a club, Charles H. J. Truman was
conspicuous at the meeting. Charles E.
Thompson was elected president of the

BUSINESS MEN" TO SERVE.
Election Board Appoint* Prominent
Cltlxrnn aa Officers at Primaries.
In. the effort to cause annoyance to the
leading â¢ citizens who are fighting the
grafters the Schmitz Election Board last
night appointed a number of San Fran
cisco's prominent business men to serve
as election officers at the coming prima
ries. With much gusto the commission
gave out the statement that these men
should appear before the body next
Thursday afternoon at 4 o'clock and then
and there give reasons why they, should
not serve. Should they be able to show
no good cause and refuse to act, it was
further stated, they would be subjected
to criminal prosecution as provided for
In the election laws of the State.
The action of the board will undoub
tedly be welcomed by the men chosen to
serve as election officers, inasmuch as it
gives the better element of citizens a
voice In conducting the primary election
and the chance to check the frauds the
push is so ready to commit.
The men who were selected by the
Election Board are Frank J. Symmes,

construction." The manager was asked
to await until Thursday afternoon for

DPt. THOMAS AREESTED
Startling Developments Are
Expected in Connection
With a Mysterious Demise
. The strange. deathof a frail, 19-year-,
old San Jose girl in-' this city last night
has been made the subject, of a .rigid
police examination, and startling facts
in connection with, criminal practice
are likely to be brought to light.. Dr.
Frank Thomas, In whose offices the girl
had been kept since last Thursday, has
been arrested and several more arrests
will follow to-day. ; The girl's name is
unknown, and had it not been for the
Interference of the police and Morgue
officials, sho would probably have been
buried and few would have. known her
fate. -' i-";
' When an attempt was made to take
the dying- statement of the girl yester
day afternoon, she gave two; names â
Emma-Camjpbell and; Gladys; Cunning
ham. She would give but little infor
mation and was dead a short time aft
erward. Just as death came Detective
Cody arrived at the place and soon, as
if by magic, an undertaker's wagon
drove up to take away the remains.
Cody called a halt to this proceeding,
summoned the Coroner and took ' the
physician into custody.
Thomas says he does not even know
the girl's name. She was brought to
his offlce irr the old Supreme Court
building from San Jose/by Dr. H. J.
Nims of that town last /Thursday. Dr.
Xlms waÃ vouched for by a Dr. Bean,
and on the strength of this Thomas al
lowed her to be placed on a cot on" his
premises, although be says he has
never taken patients of this, sort be
fore, nor does he conduct a sanitarium.
Xo name was registered and Thomas
says he did not even know where his
fee was coming- from.
At first Thomas says he was not
aware that any operation had oeen
performed and it was not until Drs.
McMillan, McLain and Van Meter were
called in that he ascertained the \u25a0 girl's
condition "and found out what was thi?
matter with her. As soon as Van
Meter was called yesterday he found
the patient rapidly sinking and' at a
glance saw it was a case for the po
lice. He communicated with Acting
Captain of Detectives Reynolds and an
Investigation was made.
Just who the girl Is has not yet been
learned. Several communications wore
sent to the San Jose police last niarht,
but as yet they have sent no reply.
Thomas blames the San Jose doctors
who sent the girl to him for anything
that may hav^ happened and it re
mains to be seen just what reply,. they
will make to his accusation. Detective
Cody will leave for the Garden City
to-day and will make a thorough .in
quiry. He will immediately bring his
pr"-?oners to this city and the. truth of
the matter will probably be disclosed.

WOMAN INSANE
Mrs. Crane of San Diego Be
comes Mad on Street at
News of Daughter's Death
DOCTORS HAVE HOPES
Say Dementia May Be Tem
porary and Reason May
Eeturn With Proper Care
A pathetic scene was enacted : yester
day afternoon on Montgomery street,
when a woman was suddenly taken vio
lently .Insane over ; the telegraphic news
that her daughter was dead. Mrs. , Crane,
who registered at the \ Russ House from
San Diego on her ; way to Seattle, was
leaving: the hotel to buy a railroad ticket
when a telegram was handed to her,
telling of the death of her only daughter,
Minnie, by . drowning, in Lake Washing
ton.
Mrs. Crane rushed down , the street,
overcome with . grief and wringing her
hands. A coupe was procured and she
was conveyed back to her hotel, 'where
doctors were working on her last I night
It is thought that the Insanity \u25a0 is only
temporary and that treatment will re
lieve her mind.

ANNUAL TOBACCO CHEWING
.; TEST FOR NAVY SUPPLY
Boards of Officials and Enlisted Bfea
Have Recorded Judgment on \
\u25a0 Merits of Samples.
'The annual. tobacco chewing contest has
taken place at Itie Brooklyn Navy Yard,
and 'i the contract r -j for tobacco has been
awarded for^the next .fiscal year. The
tests -of tobacco are by far the most In-:
teresting; that take place in any depart
ment of the "Government service. ,
All firms which desired .to supply the
Navy I with tobacco submitted samples
with their Ibids. Each bidder had the
privilege of submitting four samples at
different' prices.-. The samples were in
boxes bearing the name of the bidder and
his individual '\u25a0 sample mark on the out
side. After thp v r bids had been opened,
and the . names of the bidders and the
prices made public,. the* samples were re
marked by the letters of the alphabet, as
A, 8./ C. D, etc. The, names of the bid
ders and the . trademarks were locked up
in the Navy Department. \u25a0\u25a0< Then the letter
marked Bamples were:; shipped to the
Broklyn Navy Yard.- : .;-
A; board of officers sat in solemn Judg
ment, chewing, smoking and criticizing
the weed. The , Navy J Yard chemist an
alyzed It. [ Then the enlisted j men on | the
receiving ship , had . a chew and a 1a 1 smoke,
and passed their opinions. Finally a full
report was sent to Washington, and there
can be no doubt that it, was a; report on
tobacco and nothing else. - ;
The Government does not buy the to
bacco, as Is sometimes understood. .To
bacco purchases stand on a : , different
footing from other supplies. , The; Gov
ernment merely handles , the weed under
an appropriation from Congress, and
sells it to the bluejackets and officers at
cost price, plus, a very small charge for
the expense of handling.â Broklyn Times.

Although the gold fish; occurs in a wild

reported that in feudal days, even ; when

MISS YOUNG DENIES
SHE BEARS ILL WILL
Actress Says Miss Woodson
VI Is Not an Object of
Eny y. 11l
Actor John Craig and his wife; known
on the stage as Miss Mary Young, have
taken exceptions to reports regarding
the ill feeling existing at. the Alcazar
Theater between Miss Toung and Buss
Woodson. Mr. Craig was not home yes
terday, but his wife made the following
statement:
"There has been no auarrel and no
tempest Involving my husband and myself
with the other members of the Alcazar
company. Mr. Craig and I received an ex
cellent offer to go to Boston, and we re
signed from the Alcazar company to ac
cept the engagement. So far as I am con
cerned, I will say that the management
saw lit to Ignore me during the cloning
week of my engagement by keeping me
out of the bill, but at the same time they
paid me my salary. It was advertised that
last Saturday would be the last matinee
at. which my husband would appear at
the Alcazar. Many of the audience evi
dently expected to Bee me on the stage
and had brought flowers for me. , I, was
not in the cast, so I sat in a. stage box
to see the farewell my husband would
get at his ; closing matinee.
, "At the end of the second act, when the
audience was through applauding the fa
vorites on the stage, it turned to me and
threw bouquets up to my box, at the
same time calling upon me |to make a
speech. I stood ud , and responded with
a few words of thanks. It is true that
up to that time Miss Woodson had not
received any floral offerings, although the
other members had been profusely fa
vored. There was no Intention on my
part to 'take it out* on any member of
the company, as has been stated. slt5 It is
true that during the first two acts many
flowers were sent to my box. These
came from | the j audience and not^from
any personal friends, as my acquaint
ance in the city is limited to about twelve
pepole.
"The v applause and flowers coming
from the patrons of the theater alone
made the little manifestation all the more
delightful to me. The reports that I have
any 111 feeling toward Miss "Woodson
are entirely erroneous." '
. Mr. and Mrs. Craig will go to Monterey
for a few days at the end of this week
and then start East. Mrs. Craig haa
been engaged to play a three weeks-eng
agement tn Providence before she begins
the regular season In Boston, with her
husband. '

Little Victim Is
Wasted by Long Illness
EpÂ«d&l Dlap&tcb to Tfca Call.
DEXVXB, Julr 17Â«â With ft nail em
bedded In her left lung for nearly a
year, little four-year-old Thelma Thorn
ton baa been Buffering excruciating
agony, while physicians have been
treating her for pneumonia, bronchltla
and similar ailments. She Is now In a
critical condition, with half of her lung
destroyed, although relieved of the nail
by a peculiar circumstance.
Altixoush littla Thelma told her father
cad taÂ« physicians that she had swal
lowed a nail, they would not believe
her, How was It possible, tho physi
cians aslied, for her to have swallowed
It? It would have eons to the stomach,
and it was not there then.
The little girl was right, however,
and experienced physicians found all
their knowledge set at naught when an
abscess which had formed oa Thelma'e
lung broke oa Friday afternoon, Min
gled with the quantities of blood that
shÂ« coughed up was a small nail, so
rusted and crusted with deposits that it
was hardly recognizable. It was origi
nally of the size of a cigar box nail.
The case, according to the physicians
\u25a0wao have treated Thelma, stands with
out a parallel in science.
The nail was swallowed last October.
Instead of slipping down the throat, it
fell down the windpipe and lodged in
the lower part of the left lung. Dur
ing the xxlno months that it was lodged
therÂ« It destroyed the lower part of the
Inns, giving risa to a hacking cough
like that of a consumptive.

caee6 against the company. Argumnts

row. '
A- J. Birot, as revenue agent for Jef
ferson County, brought three jsuits
against the Southern Pacific, alleging
that the j company failed to make re
turns on personal property for. five
years. The alleged taxes are claimed
to be due on bonds, stocks, locomotives,
rolling stock, etc., of twenty- two cor
porations In various States from Louisi
ana to California. It Is claimed that
the Southern Pacific has an office at
Beechmont, Jefferson County, and the
agent of the company In this State is
John B. Weaver and that he has never
made any return of personality re-
quired by law.
County Judge Gregory will devote
the remainder of the week to hearing
the case If necessary, provided counsel
are ready to proceed with the trial. '
Revenue [Agent Blzot said to-day,
after the motions had been made in the
county court, that the back taxes, with
penalties, would amount to about $21,
000,000, but he did not expect to col
lect all the penalties. He would be sat
isfied with the principal, which amounts
to about $12,000,000.

STEAMER HERE
Appalachee | Flics "Britisk
Flaff, but She Belongs to
Bockefeller Just the Same
HELD IX QUARANTINE
Liquid Fuel Carrier Is Di
rect From Moji With a
Cargo of Tainted Ballast
The oil stpamer Appalachee which ar
rived here yesterday from the Orient flies
the British flas, but is owned by the
Standard Oil Company just the same. In
theso \u25a0waters John D. Rockefeller's fleet
is becoming quite a factor.
The Appalachee is a tank eteamer and
â¢would pass for a twin sister of the Da
kotah. which also flics the flag of one of
the Standard Oil offshoots and which now
makes San Francisco her home port. The
Appalachee was twenty-three days coÂ»
injr from MoJL She is in ballast which
will have to be discharged v at the quar
antine station. She will not be released
from Quarantine until this morning.
This Is probably the only port of its
size in the world where the quarantine
station is not equipped with that neces
sary adjunct of modern business, the tele
phone. The doctors who boared the Ap
palachee yesterday did not feel justified
in granting the vessel free pratique with
out first consulting with Dr. Cumming,
the surgeon In charge. To do this they
had to make a trip to the quarantine
station on the General Sternberg. The
Ration is far from the quarantine anchor
age and the Sternberg moves slowly
enough to qualiry as a great body. In
ihe case of the Appalachee the delay is
not particularly serious, but the same
trouble -frequently occurs with passenger
liners ahd in other cases where the extra
hour or two of unnecessary delay may
inflict great hardship in many quarters.
Once upon a time the quarantine sta
tion did have a .sort of telephone which
was operated through a strand of the
military wire. More thai a year ago the
War Department made other arrange
ments which cut off the quarantine sta
tion. The first application for an ap
propriation for a telephone cable to the
quarantine station was knocked out in
Congress by Representative Livernash,
who deemed it a needless expense. Since
then money has been appropriated, but
this is not yet available and in the mean
time, while the restof the world transacts
its hurry-up business by wireless the S~an
Francisco quarantine station Is depend
ent for its communication with the main
land upon one very slow steam tender.
It is not convenient for Surgeon Cum
mir.g to visit every incoming vessel and
there are certain conditions, which, when
found, must be referred to him. before
pratique is granted. In most cases a few
\u25a0words over the telephone would settle the
matter one way or the other. As it is
now, referring anything to the surgeon
in charge means a delay of from two to
three hours.
Thirty Days From Honolulu.
The sdwoaer Alice Cooke, which arrived yes
terday from Honolulu, iiad bard luck in the
way of weather from the time she left the
island port until the passed in through the
Golden Gate. Heavy rains, squalls and calm*
alternated with aggravating r*raiÂ£t<3cy . until
July 3 when an easterly gale demoted its
attention, to stripping the. -schooner of her
wir.gs. Two Jibs were split and the spinnaker
was blown away. She was thirty days from
port to port, one of the longest passages made
in some time. She brought 21,653 sacks of
euÂ£ar.
Battle Abbey Makes Quirk Run.
The British bark Battle Abbey arrived yes
terday from Eureka, where she has been load
ing lumber for Fremantle. She came from
the Iluraboldt port in two days, and the wind.
which er.abled her to make almost steamboat
fpeed. held fair for her passage through the
GoMen Gate, and with everything set and
drawing ehe sailed Into the harbor and up to
her anchorage. She has called here to finish
fading.
Fire Destroys Salmon Plant.
Tht Alaska Packers' Association received
word yesterday that two buildings of their
Kussiioff p!ant were destroyed by fire July 14
and that 8000 cases of salmon were consumed
by the fames. The other buildings were un
injured and no harm befell the principal part
of the reason's pack, which was safely etowed

MANY PRINTERS
ARE DESERTING
Several Shop Foremen and
Strike Breakers From
St. Louis Leave Work
DISCUSSION OF FIGHT
Union Meeting Brings an In
dorsement \ of Stand for
Eight Hours to the End
Desertions still continue among the
strike-breaking printers and those
brought out from the East by the local
Typothetae are gradually leaving the
non-union camp with charges of misrep
resentation expressed . against the em
ployers. The foremen of the Dettner-
Wilson and Payot, Upham & Co. shops
have quit working for nine hours and
Â«ay r - that they will remain out as long
as the v employers persist in their de
mands.
It is understood around union head
quarters that an Easterner, who was
brought out as a strike breaker, has vis
ited Secretary Maclntyre and demanded
transportation home, saying that condi
tions here were misrepresented to him
when he joined the car at Kansas City.
Printers claim his fare will be paid.
"Stand by your colors to the end," was
the motto announced by the Printing
Pressmen's Union at the meeting last
night, when the question of the printers'
fight for an elght-fiour day was' under
discussion!'
At the meeting of the Union Printers'
Mutual Aid Society last Sunday the'fol
lowing officers were elected for the ensu
ing term:
President. John Collins; first vice president,
O. J. Treat: second vice president, F. S. Car
mona; recording? secretary, J. P. Spencer; finan
cial secretary. G. H. Branch; treasurer, H. V.

Kelly, J. A. Snell, R; Sleeth, R. Hamshar and
John Collins; physician. Dr. A. B. McGill;
druggist, H. F. Dugan.
An increase of S6OO in the fund of the
society was reported by the auditing
committee which examined the secre
tary's books and accounts. This Increase
leaves a net bank account of $8465 70.
This good showing justifies the society in
raising the death benefits from $60 to $100.
Preparations are being made by Local
64 of the International Steam Engineers
for their convention, which is to assem
ble here on July 29. .
President J. J,. Franklin has resigned
his position with the Journeymen Bar
bers. It is possible that Vice President
French will succeed him. Franklin says
that he is going into business for him
self and as an employer cannot be ' a
member of a union, his resignation nat
urally follows.
Business Agent A. Gorfinkel reported to
the Barbers' Union _ that certain shops
persisted In keeping open after the time
for closing. A watch will be kept for
violators of the rule. '

the audience and made a short speech.
She said that she had been in tha Peat

seven : years, ago. ' In : the society oC
which she was a member there were
six trustees: â five men. and herself.
She '.-thought it was a good thing to
have a' woman in a society of this kind.
She thought that many times a woman
could get f appropriations from the city
government where men would fail in
the same request. Her remarks were
loudly, applauded.

Fire Startles Audience.
A short . circuit - coming - in: contact
with a Mm of a picture machine caused
a flame to shoot skyward from the gal
lery of the. Central Theater last night
and for, a moment, it looked as if a
panic would result. The coolness and
advice of Herschel Mayall and William
Brrtt allayed the alarm of the audience.
The house was filled to its capacity and
the ? picture machine was showing on a
curtain the pictures of a prizefight,
when, suddenly' from the little wooden
house from where the ' operator was
stationed, flames" appeared. Herschel
Mayall; from the; stage, and "William
Britt from a box shouted to the audi
ence that there was no j danger, and it
remained quiet. The flame was quickly
extinguished and no one was injured.

Prune* Advanced in !Vctt York.
Late rnsLil advices from New York cay:
"The market has a quiet appearance, and
new features are, as usual at this time of the
year, very few. Advices received from the
coast yesterday reported sales of Santa. Clara
prunes for October shipment on a. 3c basis.
While in the aggregate quite a number of cars
have been sold at that price, the individual
transactions rarely exceeded one or two cars
&nd the largest eaJe mentioned was of four
cars. The demand appears to have come from
other sections of the country than the East, aÂ«
buytVs here who have bought some prunes
against early probable wants, when prices
were on a lower level, are now Inclined to hold
eff, . apparently expecting history to repeat it
self. Not a great deal of interest is mani
fested in future peaches. Some brokers re
ported that they would be able to do some
business for Auffust-Se-ptember shipment if
they could get shippers on the coast to name
pilcet. The latter, however, are Indifferent
sellers pending more definite crop developments
end pnets that are quoted eeem.to be merely
r.orr.inal. When it comes to business, sellers
do not sÂ«m to be willing to confirm orders on
the basis of mail Quotations, but made no
counter offers to bids. Apricots are quiet. No
change in the raisin situation is noted. There
js a. moderate demand for spot currants and
the market Is firm under light stocks."

NEW YORK July ,17.â The 'narrow and
.professional character of the day's market
>Â«'.Â« not obscure thÂ« firmness Of Its undertone.
Jibe demand was unimportant and centered on
" only a few etocks influenced by epecUl causes,
but the demand was still sufficient to absorb
the tcanty offerings for guch stocks as enjoy
enythlng like ej) ordinary degree of activity.
In son* of the more obscure stocks the lethargy
d the day had larger effects : where â¢ any^ at
tempt was made to market ' stocks, wide de
clines rÂ«su!ilr.g In some Â»ucb .cases.' The
moderate strength shown In a few. cases, and
which was the sustaining Influence on the
rest of the market, was due mostly to divi
dend rumors. Union Pacific Southern Pacific.
Erie and Amalgamated Copper were ": all In
thÂ» list. So far as the restraint on the mar
ket wac doe to ary apprehension of a closer
money market it was not' Justified by. any
immediate development, although" the sub
treasurv operations reflected the . payments on
account of Government deposits recalled for
Saturday last. The total ct- the 1 Installment
railed amount* to about $11,000,000 for all
the natiosal banks of ~ the country. As a
matter of fact the Government - has expended
since the Ist of July aod of - the new - fiscal
year In excess of Its receipts $12.438.158, , thus
more than offsetting the withdrawal from the
market under the call for Saturday. : Banker*
{ aJco expect that the Government bond* , held
tc secure the deposits In the banks' and now
released wUI promptly go Into use for taking
out additional circulation. Some, of . the', pro-,
ceeds of the new Japanese . loan - subscription
also are likely to be restored to the market
shortly. Applications were to be accompanied
with S per cent, and the oversubscriptions
may be employed to the extent or another- 5
per cent to discount the second installment of
the rubscrlptlons flue on \ AagUft 3. â¢ This
would absorb $5,000,000 of the $10,000,000 of
V bonds. The excers would .be \u25a0 returnable .to
Jl})-Â» subscribers on the allotment, which was
In London to-day and wm .be made la
- New York on\ Wednesday. Bat It Is felt that
whrn the remaining Installment Is \u25a0 paid ; In
fkrtober .it' Is. likely to be' remitted abroad
shortly. Any prospect of a Russian Indemnity
loan belnr offered would probably 'disincline
the Japanet* Government to leave large euins ,
on deposit in the banks of the western world
for the benefit indirectly of a Russian | loan
flotation. Demand for time loans was re
ported good but the supply ample. Railroad
olficials spoke of the increasing demand â¢ for
all lines of commodities owing to growing
confidence In the grain crop, and to-day's
weather reports were favorable. The day's
occasional strong spots were not well held,
and as the heat wave became aggravated the
market drifted into the doldrums and closed
at small changes from last week"s level.
Bonds were Irregular. Total sales, par
value, $2,415,000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
call.

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO. July 17.â Perfect weather. caused
prices in the -wheat market to' sag "here to
day. ".-/" . . â¢
The market was weak from , start , to the
finish. i'At the opening the September, delivery
was off to lc at S3%@S3%c. The ' factor
that exerted the greatest \u25a0 influence was . the
continuance of ths ideal weather for crops â¢in
the Northwest and Southwest. -. Clear skies and,
warm temperatures prevailed everywhere
throughout the wheat growing ' districts' of
Canada and the United States. .' Soirthw?stern
grain markets \u25a0 were to-day deluged . .with > a
flood of new wheat, arrivals' at Kansas City
and St. Louis -, being 557,036 < bushels compared
with 142,279 bushels- the (corresponding day -a
yenr ago. The free marketing , of ' the : new
crop .was an additional reason for \u25a0 the selling
pressure ; that was In evidence . here during, the
entire session. A liberal decrease.: In the
world's shipments' seemed to be wholly. Ignored.
Likewise a decrease of 2,888,000 bushels â¢ on
passage had apparently no effect..' Interest of
traders manifestly centered â¢ in 1 conditions that
surrounded the,.han - estlpg ;of the fall-*own
crop and in the maturing' of the sprlngfcrop.
With these conditions favorable 'the only. supV
port practically was from shorts.: . Fresh 'dÂ«^
cline In thÂ« price of cash wheat, at all_j^rge
centtrs helped to depress option pricwjfnere.
For September the lowest point of : the day was
reached at S2^c. | The market closed extreme
ly Weak with September at 82TSc. ."\u25a0
.^.Minneapolis; Duluth: and' Chicago 'reported
receipts 0f, 241 cars against 222 cars last week
and 3t'O cars a year aso. \u25a0 - "â¢
Considerable activity was manifested in the
corn market. â¢As a result of the congested con
dition of the July delivery, sharp advances oc
curred In the advance of that ; option? early In
the B*-EslorÂ« resulting In a strong > market - for :
the more distant months. A few of â¢ the bull
-leadere \u25a0 were .. actK'ij* buyert during the/ first
hour. : : Later, the 'in..rk*t Â«lumtÂ«ed \u25a0 off as sud

profit-taking * being - responsible ;f or: the " reac
tion. Weather; conditions wer* favorable for.

In the price of wheat was another "reasons for:

LIVING TOO^ HASTILY
AMERICANWOMENBREAKDOWN
Irregularities and Female Derange-
ment* Result â Cured by Lydia B.
Pinkham 1 s Vegetable Compound.
Owing to our mode and manner of
Hring, and the nervous haste of every
woman to accomplish just so much
each day. it is said that there is not
one woman in twenty-five but what
suffers with some derangement of the
female organism, and this is the secret
of so many unhappy homes.
No woman can be amiable, light-
hearted and happy, a joy to her hus-.
band â¢ and children, and perform â¢ the
duties incumbent upon her, when she is
suffering with backache, headache,
nervousness, sleeplessness, bearing,
down pains, displacement of the womb,
spinal weakness or ovarian troubles.
Irritability and snappy retorts take.
! the pla.ee of pleasantness, and all sun-
shine is driven out of the home,- and
lives are wrecked by woman's great
enemy â womb trouble.
Head this letter:
Dear Mrs. Pinkham:â

FRANCIS MEN ACES
FREE LUNCHES.
Chicago's Champion Gobbler Ren
ders Lunch Counter Barren..
New Arrival Downs .All Edibles;
but Declines to Buy. â¢ -
The bartender at 1053 Market street had
Just put the finishing touches on the
lunch counter. "Vun more clam in der
clam Juice, shoost for goot measure," he
said generously. Just then Francis Me-
Quaide arrived.
Francis had Just come from Chicago,
where they mix their free lunches under
a microscope. He had a vacancy like
the Colorado Canyon in his interior. His
digestive organs were rumbling- like a
volcano. . . .
Without waiting to say grace he waded
into the lunch.
A plate of sliced bologna sausage van-
lshed like the pea under the other wal
nut shell. The pork and Wienerwurst
lasted ' about as long. The pickled
anchovies tumbled into his voracious
maw In three gulps. x
"Gott lm hlmmel," gasped the barten
der. "Did you say beer or whisky?" :
But Francis was gnawing the last ear
of the pig's head and reaching for the
sauerkraut bowl with the other, hand.
The kraut went like grass before a
prairie fire. f
"I pelief you said steam," remarked
the bartender pointedly. |
But Francis said nothing. He had. his
mouth to the clam juice tureen and the
appetizing fluid was gurgling down his
throat. Meanwhile a disengaged hand
was coyly fingering the cracker bowl.
"Ach. himmel," pleaded the bartender,
"Dink of the other gustomers vat must
go hungry." -\u0084 ':.
Francis took the corned beef in both
hands and gnawed at It. His eyes rolled
in ecstacy as the prepared horse, meat
faded like a summer twilight.
"Vill you gif your order again, blease?"
hinted the bartender. "I didn't shoost
catch it."
Francis dipped into the schmeerkase
sandwiches, three at a time, varying the
course with an occasional half dozen
pretzels. /
"Say." shouted the bartender, loosing
his temper. "Are you going to puy a
trlnk or ain't you?"
. The celery and water cress were wilt
ing away before Francis' appetite -and he
was eying the raw hamburger expect
antly. In his haste to reach the delicacy
Francis overturned a couple of plates.
"Gott lm hlmmel," moaned the bar
tender. "Don't eat der silverware. It's
a bresent from meln mutter.",
Francis did not hear the plea. He had
reached the cheese sandwiches.
' "Donnerwetter!" shrieked \u25a0 the barten
der. "Are you going to puy a trink?"
Francis reached over and. hit the bar
tender In the eye. When Policeman Mar
tin arrived nothing was left but the clam
juice tureen and Francis, had bitten into
the top of it.
"What's your occupation?", demanded
Judge Conlan. when the case came be
fore him yesterday.
"I'm a champion eater,", replied Fran
cis. "I had several medals, which I
would produce to prove It. only I got
hungry on my trip here. Consequently
they are gone.".
"Shudge," pleaded William. Schartin,
the bartender. "I pelief him yen he
says he . is der schampion eater." But
mem Gott, if he is durned loose, der
Saloon Geepers" Assassination ; vill pc
gompelled to omit der free lunch.".
"That will never do," said Judge Con
lan.. "The free lunch is la distinctively
American | institution and must be pro
tected* at any cost* Prisoner,*, you are
found guilty of malicious mischief and
battery.:. l do not like to encourage In
temperance,' but I maintain : that after
eating this man's * crockery ware: and
spooni, the least you might have done
was to buy a drink." , - ; â¢
Francis is at the .City; Prison, await
ing; sentence. A trusty : is detailed to
guard him, for Francis Is still: hungry
and might eat his .way out of the jail.
"I have a widow and seven starving
orphans at home," pleaded ; John Rod
gers to a crowd of Chinatown tourists.
"On !de Fourt' dey had nothin' to eat
but firecrackers dat â¢ had been shot : off."
The paper put their digestions on the
bum. The mortgage is foreclosing and
me landlord's got a \u25a0 pull wid s de . Sheriff.
For de love of Gawd ship me a dime"."'.
The tourists unloosened' and Rodgers
moved to the next block- \ He spotted a
stout man': who; looked like a disguised

with a can of easoline. - 1 -V- /.-\u25a0
Flames spurted a -hundred feet into

managed to rescue .the off . hind -wheel
of the automobile. "The rest went up

George Hodson, a deep sea mariner,
reached the musical stage of a- Jag
when he arrived at Steuart and Mar

would easily permit him 'to stand on
Mount Diablo and" tell., his wife out at
Twin . Peaks that he would not be home
for dinner. Consequently, when he .be

around corners^ wondering what "circus

pathetic theme that he chose. - He sang
it with variations.- y. ; .;-"; .; ; ;

Only One Corporation Asks
for Eeduction on Fran
chise and ;That Is Denied
The ..Board of ; Supervisors, yesterday
completed its labors as a Board of. Equal
ization", In -the 'matter; of ."petitions for re
ductions' in assessment values. A resolu
tion was adopted approving the . roll for
1903-1906. as revised " by the Assessor.
4 The added" 20, per cent as a penalty
which was imposed on the arbitrary as
sessments of Icnati Steinhart and Wil
liam McDonald was withdrawn, they
having made , satisfactory explanation as
to their neglect 'to appear In answer to a
summons. " ;â¢*: - ;
-The Occidental Hotel assessment was
I reduced . f rom SIGO.OOO to 5120.000 and
charged to clerical error.- and the "Asses
sor will revise the assessment . on Clay
street, between Drumm and East streets.
The board refused to reduce the valua
liom assessed on "City Hall' 1 lots bÂ«-.
longing to . Henry W. Morris and Morris
Hyman, and allowed the figures to stand
at J13C.340 and $139,570 respectively. Three
City,- Hall lots belonging to Julius
Platshek were reduced to J40.000 each.
-A r number of applications for reduc
tions-were referred to the ; Assessor-
Among these *, was an arbitrary assess
ment of $100,000 "on the bonds' and money
belonging to the "estate of William Mack.
'P. . A.' Bersrerot. attorney for executor,
agreed to file an affidavit that" Mack. wa3
â¢ not a resident of this State when he died.
' There were pnly 206 applications for re-
J ductions" filed, against 705 for last year.'
But one application was filed by a cor
poration, that of the Bank of California,
which' wanted the assessment on its
.franchise reduced from 5750,000 to $10,000.

to Scott's Demand for Li
censes on 804? Street Cars
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
referred to the Judiciary committee a
proposed ordinance Introduced by Braun
hart, setting apart space for and direct
ing the construction of a Memorial Hall
In the New Public Library building, to
be occupied by the Grand Army of the
Republic during the existence of' that or
ganization ] and thereafter to .be mai^U
talned as a depository for military flaga^
and mementoes.
The City Attorney was requested to
solicit offers from the- owners of tho
lands \u25a0 necessary to be acquired for the
opening of Hampshire street and the Im
provement of York street. The sum of
(15,000 has ' been set aside in the budget
for. the eradication of the Preclta Valley
swamp.
The Mission Federated Clubs petitioned
the board to take steps to acquire at
least twelve parks for that section lying
south of Twentieth street, tho parks to
have an area of not less than one hun
dred acres each.
'The same organization petitioned the
board to acquire a complete water sup
ply for "this city on the alleged ground
that recent developments in the courts
have shown that the Spring Valley Water
Company is a grasping, soulless corpora
tion, whose existence is- a source of po
litical corruption and only limited by
the ability of the helpless people to
pay their demands." .
Property owners filed a protest against
the granting of a permit to Alva B.
Clute to build a stable on Jersey street,
between Chattanooga and Church sts.
The Market Street Improvement Club
called attention to the deplorable condi
tion of. Shipley street between Fifth and
Sixth.
Tax Collector Scott referred to the
board the protest of the United Railroads
against his demand that the corporation
pay a quarterly, license on SO4 street cars
and asking what action to take in the
matter. The company says . that It al-^
ready pays $404,000 yearly In taxes ' to thaW
city and it would be unjust to Impose thei^
license on 804 cars, when many of them
are in the repair shop or used only on
certain warm days. -The company claims
its franchises provide for licenses on cars
In actual use only.

" My left hand was almost covered ;
with a large red sore which would itch
: terribly. I doctored with it four
months, also tried everything I could
think of, but I would only have tem-
porary relief. A competent physician t
of Kansas City shoolc his head ar.v'Jl.
said, "lt looks . bad." Then a f riencf*
told me of Cuticura, and as I had tried
so much, I thought I might as well try
" that too, and I bought a set of Cuti-
cura Soap, Ointment, and Resolvent.
' Just three days and nights after I had
"- taken the first dose, the } inflammation
'had all gone from the sore; and when
. I had taken three bottles and a half of
Resolvent, my hand was all well.
- "It gives me pleasure to tell you of
this, and if any one wishes to write
to me personally, I shall be glad to
