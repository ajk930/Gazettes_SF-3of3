CHINESE COOK SUSPECTED OF POISONING MRS. STANFORD
DETECTIVES ARE HOLDING AH WING IN CUSTODY
AT MANSION ON NOB HILL PENDING THE INQUEST
SPECIAL CABLE TO THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL
HONOLULU, March 2-Miss Bertha Berner, who was Mrs. Stanford's secretary, has named Ah Wing, a Cninese
cook employed at Mrs, Stanford's San Francisco home, as the person whom she suspects of placing the strychnine
in the bicarbonate of soda. Advices received here are to the eff^t that Ah Wing is in the custody of detectives
in San Francisco. More arrests are expected to follow at the conclusion of the investigation into the cause of death.

c mystery attending the death 'of Mrs. Jane Lathrop Stan
ford at Honolulu is beginning to unravel. Once convinced that
bad been poisoned, the police in this city were not slow to fol
low up clews and fasten suspicion.
One person is already in custody. Ah Wing, a Chinese cook
had been in the employ of Mrs. Stanford for almost a quar-
I a century, is being held by the detectives at the mansion on
Xob Hill. The outcome of the inquest, which will take place to
day in Honolulu, is awaited before a formal arrest is made.

several persons are involved, as seems likely, there will be con

known to have be*-i provided by Mrs. Stanford's will and jeal

Mrs. Stanford in this city in January is now verified by the posi

hours after it was suspected in Hono

a statement made by Miss Berner, pri

Wing was put under strict surveillance
yesterday. According to advices re
oplv*Â»d from Honolulu by Acting Chief
Spillane, Miss Berner has made a
statement to High Sheriff Henry and
other officials of the Territory that she
â strongly suspected Wing and that
even Mrs. Stanford, after her recent
experience in. San Francisco, talked
with Miss Berner,. durfng the trip to
Honolulu, that Wing might have

ANOTHER COOK IS WATCHED.
While the detectives were preparing
to place Wing within certain bounds,
another detective was sent into 'China
town to find Yeng, another cook, who
had worked in the California-street
mansion and at the Palo Alto home of
Mrs. Stanford up to her departure for
the Islands. Yeng was found with Ht

: ! '..; The other theory is the .stronger
â¢' with the detectives. : It is the opinion

. . .der to get a lump sum of money. â¢ ,
- : If. Mrs. Stanford's death is shown to

â¢ made careful search of Mrs. Stanford's
'" ; CaiiforhiaVstreet home and her place
Ir. Palo Alto. At. both they hay*. found â¢
'.a;.piie-i>ound can of imported blear
. bdirate of soda. The can at the Palo
"Alto home had: not been opened, but
'-.frbttT the one discovered in the Cali- :

is= claimed, were close enough to Mrs.
Stanford to srain the opportunity to

statement in Honolulu Wednesday and
that of Miss Hunt, the maid, was

1Â»OLICE ARE CONFIDENT.
Thf- circumstances are so positive in
so far as th? soda is concerned that if
a murder was really planned, as the
report of the autopsy surgeons will to-
day determine, the local detectives en
jraeed in the case feel certain they
will hayÂ»? no difficulty in narrowing the
crime down to at most four persons,
all of whom might hare been a gainer

DETECTIVK AT BERNER HOME.
Acting Chief Spillane, Detective
Captain Burnett and Captain Callun
dan of Morse's Detective Agency,
which was the first to be employed on
the Stanford poisoning mystery, w^re
in conference at the Hall of Justice
for several hours yesterday, but just
â what plans they discussed is a mat
ter they are keeping secret.
Captain Callundan was also in con
ference with Charles Lathrop, brother
of Mrs. Stanford, for some time daring
the day, but later refused to make any
statement.
When Charles L/athrop was asked if
there was anything new in the case he
politely referred his interviewer to At
torney Wilson, and the latter then
shrewdly gent his visitor to Callundan,
who promptly excused himself with the
explanation that whatever information
he had belonged to those who had en
gaged his services, and the privilege of
making it public devolved wholly upon
them. He wae again appealed to last
night, but refused to give out any in
formation further.
' From other. sources, howevÂ«r, â¢it was
learned that one of Morse's agents had
been sent to Palo Alto In the afternoon'
to. talk with Mrs. Berner, mother of
Miss Bertha : Berner,- Mrs. Stanford's
private secretary. Earlier in the day
when Mrs. Berner was asked jif her
daughter, before .groins to the. Orient,
had expressed to her any .suspicion as
to .Who might have .'placed poison in
the mineral water, taken by -Mi's, Stan
ford, she admitted that Miss Bertha,
had strongly intimated that she and
Mrs. Stanford â at that - time . strongly
suspected that the . crime might be
traced, to Ah Wing. . ' - â :-.; 'â â¢ 'z*.
Later yesterday, however, after Mrs.
Berner had received a call from the
representative of the Morse detective
agency, sho grew rxtremely reticent
and refused to make any ' Statement re
garding the case or even reiterate the
statement made earlier.
According to advices received last
evening from Palo Alto the detective
was still at the Berher home, whU-h
IH " built for its mistress by Mrs:
Stanford, and was assisting Mrs. Ber
ner m avoiding interviewers. Another
report that reached this city late yes
terday was to the effect that a man,
supposed to be a San Francisco de
ttctive. was shadowing Elizabeth Rich
mond and Albert Beverly, the former
maid and butler of the Stanford home,
who are living at Beverly's house on
San Mateo Heights.
Iri the early reports of the death en*
Mrs. Stanford. in Honolulu her maid,
May Hunt, who accompanied, her mis
tress to the islands; was described as
a newly employed servant. As a mat
ter of fact Miss Hunt was In the em
ploy of Mrs. Stanford for many years,
but about fouf years ago she received
financial assistance from the kind wo
man and opened a lodging-house in
this city. Recently she abandoned that
business and returned to the employ of
Mrs.' Stanford, whe had always shown
a kindly interest in her welfare.

ROBERT BERNER
IS INTERVIEWED
Denies That His Mother
Suspects Any One of
the Poisoning.
STANFORD. UNIVERSITY, March 2.
What Mrs. Berner, the aj?ed mother of
Miss Bertha Berner, secretary to Mrs.
Stanford, might say in regard to the
alleged poisoning of Mrs. Stanford, her
son does not wish her to tell. Late last
night she declared to a reporter that
her daughter and herself had direct
suspicions against a "certain individ
ual." Mrs. Berner also eald she be
lieved this Honolulu poisoner was the
same person who attempted to murder
Mr?. Stanford in San Francisco last
January, but she refused absolutely to
name that person.
To-day Robert Berner, the son and
brother, has guarded the doors of the
Rerner residence a.t Monte Verde, just
above th<* university, and declares that
he will shoot any reporter that at
tempts to see his mother. He angrily
said:
Th?y would never have Been my mother last
night but for the fact that 1 was away. I
have^ guarded her cluFely ever since the mid
dle of January to keep her away from you
newspaper men. and the minute I leave you
swoop down and she tells the very .thing that
I riidn't want her to say.
Â» .My mother 1b 75 years of age and she did
not know what she was talking about last
nipht. She Is prostrated to-day over thÂ«
effects of that" interview.
1 do not know whether Bertha will ever
come back alive to us or not, there seems
to be so much poison floating around every
where. The statement that Mrs. ' Berner is
re-ported to have made a remark that she could
place her hand upon the person who committed
thf crime Is entirely without foundation. It
Is horrible to have these Insinuations cast
â¢ bout 'my mother and sister. I don't know
what we will hear next. .Mother Is terribly
grieved over tii" situation of affAira. It Is
an appalling blow to us. Mrs. Stanford has
been such a good friend to Bertha that we
cannot express the terrible grief -we feel at
her death.
Mr. Berner has been away from Palo
Alto much of the time. He returned to
his mother's home here last January
and has been with her continually ever
since.
Mrsi Berner has received several
letters from her daughter since h<jr de
parture with Mrs. Stanford for Hono
lulu. In one of them, written three
days out, Miss Berner says: "The
storms are terrible, but we do not
mind, because they are less terrible
than the things we left at San Fran
cisco. Mrs. Stanford worries all the
time. It is terrible to see the face that
is so dear to me grow so suddenly old.
Except for this feeling of depression
Mrs. Stanford feels quite well." This
was the last heafd from Miss Berner.
The mother of the secretary was in
great fear lest the daughter also be
made a victim of the poisoning.
SAYS MISTRESS
WAS POISONED
Miss Berner Describes
Scene at Death of
Mrs. Stanford.
Special Cable to The Call.
HONOLULU, March 2.â Miss Bertha
Berner, private secretary to the late
Mrs. Stanford, is positive her mistress
was poisoned. "Yes," she said, "I
believe she was poisoned, but by whom,
or how, or why, I have not the slight
est idea. Mrs. Stanford herself be
lieved she was poisoned. She said so
repeatedly while we were working over
her before she died. She exclaimed
almost as soon as I entered" her room:
'Oh, Bertha, I believe I have been
poisoned.'
"When the doctor came she told him
to get a stomach pump, she be
lieved she had been poisoned. He said
she must be mistaken, but she re
peated it and certainly believed she
had been poisoned. Mrs. Stanford told
me to tell the doctor what had hap
pene.d before, meaning the previous at
tempt on januaiy 14 to poiÂ§on her at
her home in San Francisco. She real
ized that unless she could vomit she
would not recover. Her mmd was per
fectly clear.
"While we were working over her
giving her hot water to drink and
bathing her feet she was in convul
sions, but her mind was clear until the
last moment. She did not say any
thing as to â  who had poisoned her.
"I erot the medicines out of the trunk
for her just before she retired to bed
Tuesday right. I- got a cascaret
capsule and about a half teaspoonful
of powder from a bottle marked 'bicar
bonate of soda.' She told me to get
them, saying she would take both.
She told me to take some soda. I re
plied I was going to take a capsule
and would not take soda. I have seen
the bottle marked 'bicarbonate of soda'
for some time. It had the label of an
Adelaide (Australia) druggist, but I do
not ' recall the circumstances of its
purchase.
"For some reason she kept that bot
tle. My mind isn't clear as to the
bottle, but I am under the impression
that as fast as its contents were used
by Mrs. Sanford she either sent It out
to have â¢it refilled at a druggist's or
got powder in quantity to have the,
bottle filled at home. I never had any
thing to do with that. I am at present
unable to recall anything about it.
Mrs. Stanford was .in the habit of tak
ihg bicarbonate of soda when her stom
ach did not feel well, but she didn't
take it regularly or in any large quan
tities.
"The bottle which is believed by the
police to have contained the strychnine
that killed Mrs. Stanford was packed
in a steamer trunk' by Miss May Hunt,
Mrs. Stanford's maid."
RELATIVE SEES NO MOTIVE.
NEW YORK, March 2. â "I am ab
solutely at a loss to understand why
any one should have wished to take
Mrs. Stanford's life," said Colonel
George Perkins Lawton, Mrs. Stan
ford's nephew-in-law. "I am also un
able to understand how such an en
emy could approach her. She was
always a careful woman and was
guarded by her servants and attend

sensational developments surrounding
Mrs. Stanford's tragic death will ensue.
This information was given out late
this afternoon by one high In author
ity, and indicates that the detectives of
San Francisco have the strange case
well in hand and are ready to act
promptly. From the same source it
was learned to-night that the authori
ties in San Francisco, who have been
carrying on a voluminous correspond
ence during the last twenty-four hours
with the officials here, have their sus
picions directed toward at least four
persons, who were closely connected
with Mrs. Stanford in her private life..
Of this number it was learned here to
day that one is already practically un
der arrest in San Francisco and that
his detention was the result of Miss
Berner's open accusation that she had
reason to suspect him. Although the
authorities refuse to discuss the case
for publication, having been advised to
take this stand by the Police Depart
ment of San Francisco, it was learned
that the man now under arreat in San
Francisco is the Chinese cook, who had
long attended Mrs. Stanford.
MISS BERNER IS RETICEXT.
When asked to-day if she had reallj
made an accusation against the cook
or had been in any way responsible
for the suspicion directed against him.
Miss Berner refused to make any an
swer, explaining that she did not mean
to conceal anything that might ma
terially aid in sifting to the bottom the
mystery that surrounds her mistress'
death, but had been instructed, in the
interest of justice, to refrain. from dis
cussing the matter.
Keenly appreciating that they are.
involved in solving one of the greatest
criminal cases in the history of the
Hawaiian islands, the detective force
of Honolulu is to-day exerting every
DR. BOERICKE
GIVES OPINION
Says Strychnine Might
Have Caused Illness
in January.
Dr. "William Boericke, the physician
who attended- Mrs. Stanford subse- 1
quent to the alleged poisoning of Jan
uary 14, said last night that although
he treated Mrs. Stanford for grippe,
she told him on the occasion of his last
visit that she had been poisoned. At
the time Dr. Boericke made his three
viaitii Mrs. Stanford was in bed and
seemed- very weak.
Dr. Boericke said that although she
manifested all the symptoms of grippe,
such" as coughing and high tempera
ture, which was 103, the fever and
high temperature might have been the
after effects of strychnine.
In telling the doctor of the effects of
drinking the mineral water Mrs. Stan- ]
ford laid great stress on her belief that J
an attempt had been made to poison
her and despite the doctor's reassur
ances nothing could change her mind.
Mrs. Stanford, however, made no men
tion of taking bicarbonate of soda
with the mineral water and the doctor
says he did not recommend eft forbid'
her to take the harmless combination.
At that time Mrs. Stanford spoke only
of the mineral water and declared that
poison was undoubtedly placed in it.
One of Mrs. Stanford's friends is the
authority for the assertion that Dr.
Boericke prescribed medicine for his
distinguished patient in little candy
jujubes to do away with the unpleasant
taste of the drug, but Dr. Boericke de
nies that he made any such prescrip
tion. If Mrs. Stanford had such me
dicinal pellets in her possession they
were Without his recommendation or
knowledge, he says.
Prior to his call on Mrs. Stanford on
January 21, the first of the three vistU
he made after the attempted poison
ing. Dr. Boericke had not attended
upon Mrs. Stanford for nearly two
years. In fact, during that interval
she was not attended by any physician,
1 having a strong disinclination to eon
suit doctors except in extreme sick
ness. The fact that Dr. Boericke wan
rammoned seems therefore to point to
the idea that Mrs. Stanford deemed
herself in serious danger, whether
from grippe or from the effects of
strychnine.
On his second visit the t doctor still
treated her for grippe and the condi
tion of his patient was about the same.
There seemed nothing in her condition
to arouse suspicion of poisoning, and
after prescribing simple remedies and
cautioning her against exertion, he de
parted.
It was not unUl the third visit that
Mrs. Stanford spoke of the poisoning.
She related to him how, after drinking
from a bottle of Poland water, she was
taken deathly sick and despite the
doctor's attempts nothing could shake
from her mind the idea that she had
been poisoned. One of the things that
bothered Mrs. Stanford wmm to account
for any enemy who would want to
effort to gather together valuable clews
that will aid their felloe sleuths in San
Francisco in running to earth the
poisoner or poisoners, should to-mor
toWs results of the autopsy clearly
suggest that a crime has been coqa
mitted.
Although the detectives have not
given the slightest Intimation to Miss*
Berner that shÂ« is being carefuyy
watched, it is nevertheless a fact. A
watch is also being, kept upon May
Hunt, the maid. Both wompn seem io
realize that some suspicion is directed
toward them, and Miss Berner, tearful â¢
at times, complains that public oplrwr.
is upjuatly questioning her loyalty to
her dead mistress..
WOMEN' CLOSELY WATCHED.
While there is no- chance of either
woman leaving the island wijhout the
knowledge of the poitce, the latter,
taking, a precaution that their official
position demands, have bÂ«th women
under their eyes, thus Insuring them
selves against even the remote possi
bility of one of the women falling off
a cliff or destroying herself during" a
fit of nervous excitement, which
would mean a loss of a valuable wit
ness to- the prosecution in the event <>t
a charge of murder being preferred
against any one in the mysterious case.
To-night it was announced that t;he
next steamer from- San Frsmcisco, the
Alameda, which leaves there on Sat
urday, will have among her passengers
one or more of San Francisco's clever
est detectives, sent here to malee a
hurried investigation of the facts lead
ing up to and following Mr Stan
ford's death. It is expected that tiie
Alameda will arrive, early on
March 19. The steamship China is
due here the following day and will
convey back to San Francisco the re
mains of Mrs. Stanford, unless in the
meantime the detectives here are able
to show that the commission of th^
crime: was here and the guilt is
charged to some one here, a â¢prob
ability that no one at present offers
much hope for. The China w}fl ar

against any one and despite the doc
tor's questioning- she declared that tha
motive was inexplicable.
Mrs. Stanford seeir.M much worried
and the condition of her-hea'th not im

change of scene. It is said that when
he mentiÂ«ned going away Mrs. Stan
ford exclaimed that such action mighS

country- Dr. Boericke tried to reas

seek fhe warmer climate of tfle south

HEADS OF THE! POLICE AND DETECTIVE DEPARTMENTS OF THIS aiT WHO ARE WORKING ON IMPORTANT CLEWS
THAT MAY SOON SHED SOME LIGHT ON THE SUDDEN AND MYSTERIOUS DEATH OF MRS. STANFORD AT
HONOLULU LAST TUESDAY NIGHT.
DETECTIVE MORSE
SAYS CASE ELUDES
ALL HYPOTHESES
. Harry X. Morse, head of the Morse
Detective Agency in San Francisco,
who has been investigating the matter
ever, since Mrs. Stanford's departure,
had the following to say in regard to
the matter: -. ..':.'â¢ â¢ '
This whole â¢ business is an amazing mystery
to me. So f(U- we have -not. been able to
unearth a clew that points to any one or even
co>iflrm " the Â«tory- â  When this .case was re
ported to me by Attorney- W-ilson some." weeks
ago. we- took hold of the matter and my men
bare worn themselves out In their hunt.
. Every drugstore In San Francisco has been
visited in the hope that we might run across
come trace of the person who bought the"
poison. ' We ;found that considerable strych
nine had been sold, but we could not trace
any of it anywhere: near the Stanford home.
We â aW went- to San -Jose and took in the
way stations. " â¢" - â¢ .
While Mrs. Stanford believed that her Illness
here - was caused by '" poison she seemingly
was all right .that nest morning and- neither
her brother nor Attorney "Wilson took much
etock la It, but they did come to me to have
the matter given . & thorough investigation.
Attorney Wilson and Captain Callunden of my
office questioned all Mrs. Stanford's. attendants
and "could find nothing that gave them any
clew that everything- was not all -tight with
them. If there had been anything at all
suspicious we should have acted . on it. The
fact." is that When -she left here none "of her
family- believed that there had been- any crime
attempted. - ...
The aspect of the case has been changed
by developments" In- Honolulu arid- I do not
know what to think about It, I am waiting
anxiously for to-morrow "In the hopes that the
analysis of the stomach will show conclusively
whether strychnin* was -.taken; So far we
have been unable to discover any motive.
Mrs. 'Stanford's eecretary hid been with her
for twenty" years. She had everything to lose
and nothing to; gain. The. same with all the
rest- of .them.. â¢ Mrs. Stanford seemingly had
Do . enemies. . " . -
Then again' the amount of poison- said to be
found in the bicarbonate would .make it ap
pear as rf some, crazy person- had done" It.
We '.hive redoubled our efforts since the news
.of Her death, and last night I hardly slept
at .all, .'I got thinking so much* about It.
The -whole thing, however, at present Is â  a
perfect blank.- ti*ok. at H. as" 'you will there
seem to be many conflicting circumstances
connected with the affair. . .
I have no theory. I try to- keep my mind
-dear from drawing any conclusions until I
get- facts to go on, There' "evidently Is some
connection between Mrs. Stanford's illness
"here and her death -at Honolulu. If her. death
there iras caused by poison .it was put In
here -and ire must find where It came from.
There ' was strychnine spoken of . here ' and
strychnine came Into . the -case down" there,
â and it certainly" has the appearance. of intent.
I do not 'believe- thai Mrs. Stanford, did â¢ it
â herself. It It was done it was a crlnie. . To
morrow; however, will tell the.taje and if It
.'turns out that she died from strychnine poison
ing I don't know' what I shall do about it. I
shall certainly be stumped. - *<â "'â¢â¢','.

OLD FRIENDS SAY
MRS. STANFORD HAD
NO HALLUCINATIONS
Many of Mrs. Stanford's oldest
friends declare that her mind was
clear, bright and absolutely free/from
hallucination on any subject. They em
phatically scout the idea that Mrs,
Stanford ever entertained the slightest
fear of being poisoned by ajiy one or
that she abnormally dwelt on the sub
ject of death.
Mrs. J. A. Fillmore has known Mrs.
Stanford for many years, since the
â¢early days of the State, when they
were associated in Sacramento. She
declares that her old friend was un
mistakably of sound mind. Mrs. A. N.
Towne, also associated with Mrs.
Stanfond for a period of thirty years
or more, voiced sentiments of a simi
lar order, saying that recent conversa
tion and acquaintance with Mrs. Stan
ford d,id not disclose any symptoms pf
aberration.
. Judge T. B. MacFarland's statement
that Mrs. Stanford's mind was per
feotly normal was made with the great
est earnestness, he repudiating the in
sinuation that she harbored any
thought of poisoning.
Mrs. Stanford was hostess at a large
dinner on January 20 at her home on
California street, arid among the guests
â¢ were those mainly who were connected
with the early days and had followed
the career of Governor and Mrs. Stan
ford. Judge MacFarland, Mrs. Fill
more and Mrs. Towne were among the
invited ones, the hostess favoring the
friends of long standing. At this date,
according to those present, she was
bright, cheerful, active, taking pleasure
in the reunion of so many pioneers
with interests in common, and in every
way a natural and healthy woman,
barring the fact that she was troubled
with a -slight cold. But her mentality
was unimpaired in any slightest par
ticular. . .
FIGHT TO BREAK
RATE COMBINE
TOPEKA, Kans., March I.â The
Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Rail
road Company is to be included in At
torney General Coleman's suit for con
spiracy against the Standard Oil Com
pany. Coleman said to-night that the
Santa' Fe was left out of the original
petition by an error of the stenog
rapher. He will at once file an amend
ed petition to include the Santa Fe.
The suit will thus be brought against
all the railroads in the State.
The strongest feature of the suit,
according to the Attorney General, is
that relating to the failure of the Stan
dard to pay charter fees, thus having
no authority to do business In the
State. To fight the Standard Is the
real object of the suit. The action
against the. railroads is brought to
dissolve the freight rate combination.

PRESIDENT JORDAN
SCOUTS THE IDEA
OF HER SUICIDE
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, March 2.
President Jordan acknowledges that
the mystery of Mrs. Stanford's death
is more than he first would allow him
self to believe.
"I can't understand it," he said this
afternoon. "Poison has been found in
her medicine bottle. "Who could have
placed it there? In the many years I
have known her I have never known
Mrs. Stanford to have a single enemy.
The murderer, if there is one^niust
have been criminally insane. Mrs.
Stanford's mind was as clear and
strong the day of the departure as it
ever was. No doubt the attempt to
take her life in San Francisco on Jan
uary 14 weighed upon her mind, al
though when I saw her on January 15
she appeared to take the matter
lightly." .
Dr. Jordan read letters from Mrs.
Stanford dated January 18 to 20 from
the Hotel Vendome, San Jose. In these
letters she declared that her health
had in no way been benefited by her
trip to San Jose and that she had giv
en up the proposed trip to Los Angeles,
but would probably go somewhere. She
never mentioned the attempted poison
ing in any of her letters to Dr. Jordan.
"The theory qf suicide is absurd,"
continued the president. "Mrs. Stan
ford had always had a very strong
mind and, although it is asserted that
she was terribly depressed at the time
of Leiand's death, it never affected her
mind."
At the Palo Alto residence to-day the
few remaining servants were reticent
concerning the sudden death of Mrs.
Stanford. C. L. Wooster, the aged
coachman who had driven for Mrs.
Stanford for thirty years and who
came out with the party from New
York, said that the relations between
Mrs. Stanford and the servants were
of the most friendly nature. "She rare
ly talked to us," said the coach
man, "and there were few times when
I ever held what might be called a con
versation with her. Yet we all felt
that we were closely bound to her and
it never entered our heads to think of
any one harming her."
DEATH UNDER
WHEELS OF CAR
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, March 2.â Mrs. Ira
P. Smith, wife of Ira P. Smith, 'super
intendent of the Pacific Lumber Com
pany at Scotia, Humboldt County, was
struck by an electric car on the Long
Beach line this afternoon and instant
ly killed.
Mrs. Smith had been to Wlllowbrook
to look at a lot which she purchased
yesterday and was about to return
home. She stationed herself near the
electric line, but upon the wrong side
of the northbound cars. As a south
bound car approached Bhe stepped to
the other track, but seeing a car ap
proaching on that track also she Step
ped back. The southbound car struck
her with such force that her body was
hurled to the other track in front of
the approaching car. It dropped to the
track, rolled under the fender and
the wheels passed over it. Mrs. Smith
was about 30 years of age and was
a handsome woman.

PALO AXTO, March 2.â Miss ElU
abeth Richmond, who was maid
Mrs. Stanford on January 14, the time
that the first poison was administered,
is visiting Albert Beverly near Bur
llngame. She is practically prostrated
with excitement and grief. She said:
"I left Mrs. Stanford's employ of my
own accord on January 27, notwith
standing the reports that I waa dis
charged. They are utterly false. I am
only too willing to give my time and
services to help unravel this terrible
mystery. It places all those in Mrs.
Stanford's immediate household under
a terrible position. I came down here
at the invitation of Mrs. Beverly, be
cause I was followed by detectives in
San Francisco. There is considerable
money left by Mrs. Stanford, and this
should be used to employ detectives
and lawyers to unravel the mystery. I
hope it will be solved to the very end.
I was maid to Mrs. Stanford one year
and nine months.

residence, all under police guard.
Several attempts were made by a
Call representative to reach the house
or communicate with the inmates, but
all were frustrated by the guards.
When the mansion was twice called up
by telephone the response was pre
sumably by the same man, who said
his name was Lee and later Ah Wing.
There was barely a trace of Chinese
accent in his talk.
In response to a request at the gate
to see Mary Gaffney, the housekeeper,
the reply ,was that she was asleep, al
though it was but 9 o'clock in the
evening. It was also averred that the
four Chinese, Ah Wing, Lee, Ah Young
and Ah Ying, were not in the mansion
and that no restrictions were placed on
the- freedom of the occupants. A tele
phone call immediately after estab
lished the fact that at least two of the
Chinese were in the house.
The statement that no restrictions
are on the five inmates is denied by
employes, who say that they have posi
tive orders to allow no one to leave
the premises. This is In accordance
with the detention of Ah Wing by the
police.
The manner of the employes was
polite and respectful, but any attempt
to enter the iron gates of. the east
driveway was prevented.

Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
SAN BERNARDINO. March I.â A
warrant has Just been Issued for the
arrest of M. F. Thomas, a well-known
pioneer resident of this section, charg
ing him with the murder of Colonel
John N. Doyle, a hermit, who waa
found dead in his cabin in the Cajon
Pass near this city, on February H-
Thomas has not yet been found. Doyle
was shot through the abdomen with, a
charge from a shotgun, the weapon be
ing found on the floor near the body.
To-day the body was exhumed for fur
ther examination.
Thomas, for whom the warrant has
been issued, claimed that Doyle had
made a will in his favor. This will
was compared with specimens of
Doyle's and Thomas' handwriting, and
the examiners unhesitatingly pro
nounced Thomas its author. The will
was strangely lost by the attorney for
the public administrator, when the
Sheriff demanded It.
Evidence in the Sheriff's possession
Indicates that Colonel Doyle was shot
while in bed, the body being carried
to the kitchen and. so arranged beside
his shotgun as to point to the acci
dental discharge of the weapon while
he was In the act of drawing It across
a box. The coroner's Jury accepted
Thomas' version of the shooting, but
the appearance of the will and Doyle's
frequent expressions of fear that he
would be assassinated aroused the sus
picion of the Sheriff, whose unrelent
ing investigations scared Thomas oft
before the Sheriff was prepared for his
arrest. He is still a fugitive*

unfortunately they did and that they

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL. FRIDAY. MARCH 3, 1905.
TO PAY BILLS
OF THE STATE
Measure Carrying General
Appropriations Goes to
Governor for Signature
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, March 2â The gen
eral appropriation bill f<">r the main
tenance of the State government
passed the Senate to-day at noon and
was pent to the Governor for ,hls sig
nature. Th* 1 bill was passed without
debate, all changes suggested by mem
bers ot the upper house having been
made last Monday night.
Senator Ward introduced a bill this
afternoon . designed to amend the law
now existing relative to the assess
ment of the franchises of national
banka. The purpose of the amendment
Is to make the law conform to the
recent decision of the United States
Supreme Court, which is done by
amending section 3608 of the Political
Code and providing that from the gross
value of the stock of the banks in ques
tion there shall be subtracted the value
of the visible assets, the difference rep
resenting the value of the franchise
liable for assessment.
Among the bills- passed by the Sen
ate to-day was one appropriating $3000
for the purchase of lands to be added
to the grounds of the Veterans' Home
at Yountville.
Two measures that have been dls
.cussed more or less during the session
were finally defeated in the Senate.
One, designed to cover tly& Weber case,
provided that a person convicted of
murder in the first degree be barred
from inheriting through law or taking
through will any property of his vic
tim. A majority of the Senate held
that the bill, if passed, would amount
to a bill of attainder, a bill prohibited
by the federal constitution.
The other bill sought to fix the mini
mum rate of compensation for labor on
public works' at $3 a day. Senator
Rowell pointed .out that the time might
come when the State, to relieve dis
tress, might want to employ a great
army of men, a thing It could not af
ford to do if compelled to pay each man
$3 a day. This settled the question
and the bill was voted down.
Governor Pardee received a telegram
from United States Senator Perkins to
day to the effect that he had included
In the sundry civil service bill an ap
propriation of $26,000 for the mainte
nance ot the Yosemite Valley for the
coming fiscal year. Senator Perkins
also informed the Governor that the
Federal Government would accept the
regrant of the valley and would forthr
with undertake its improvement. The
members of the Legislature that fought
so hard to pass the Yosemite recession
bill are gratified at the quick action
taken by California's senior Senator
and point to the same as evidence of
the fact that the State has done a wise
thing in receding the great scenio spot
of the State to the care of the National
Government.
McCartney's bill providing that a
wife may sue for separate maintenance
or. In other words, may obtain a decree
of separation with maintenance with
out the necessity of obtaining a final
decree of divorce, thus enabling the
husband to remarry, was finally passed
by the Senate to-night, and sent' to the.
Governor for his signature.
REMODELS THE SESSIOX.
Btanton*s Bill Debated and Amended
in the Assembly.
SACRAMENTO, March 2.â The con
stitutional amendment changing the
law relative to sessions of the Legis
lature that Stanton has had on the
Assembly file for . tome weeks was
called up this morning for passage.
As submitted by him it provided for
a ninety-day session, to begin on the
same date as now, 110 a day for the
members and a limit of $600 a day for
the expenses of each house, which
would Include salaries of attaches.
Houser, chairman of the committee
on constitutional amendments,, has
been uncompromising in his conten
tion that: the expense limit should be
fixed at $450 a day and Stanton, when
he called, his amendment for passage,
offered an amendment substituting
Houser's figures for the original. The
amendment was concurred In.
Before the measure could be placed
on final passage Drew submitted
another amendment providing that
after the first thirty days of the session
the Legislature may adjourn for ten
days, during which the various oom
mittees shall visit the public institu
tions for which appropriations are de
sired and that the transportation com
panies shall furnish them transporta
tion free for euch purposes. He argued
that the* adoption- of his amendment
would do away with the soandals and
newspaper criticism* now arising from
the so-called Junketing trips. There
was no opposition and this amendment
was also adopted.
Drew said he favored fixing the sal
aries of members at a flat $1000 for the
session, as he did not believe the
people would object to paying that for
I the eighty days' work of their repre
sentatives if the latter kept the ex

BATTLING FOR MASTERY
SIXTY KILLED
IN AN ATTACK
ON LAMUTING
Czar's Infantrymen Are
Worsted in Sharp
Engagement.
GENERAL, OKU'S HEADQUAR
TERS, Feb. 28, 6 p. m. (Delayed In
Transmission). â The Russians have
been very active for several days, evi
dently expecting the Japanese to move.
That portion of the Japanese line lying
west of the railway has continuously
bombarded night and day with heavy
guns as well as field guns.
The left wing, following the example
of the extreme right, moved forward,
driving in the outposts and occupying
a line running from Shottemun to Ka
lama on the east bank of the Liao
River, twelve miles north of the Shahke
River. This completely blocked any
attempt of the Russians to turn the
Japanese left. It is probable that the
commencement of a general battle is
only a matter of hours.
The Russians are spending the days
heavily bombarding the Japanese lines
and at night making small attacks on
many points, sending out detachments
of one or two companies. All the at
tacks are easily repulsed by the Jap
anese, who are suffering no serious
loss. The most serious attack occurred
last night, when five companies of Rus
sian infantry desperately assaulted
Lamutlng, which has been attacked a
score" of times since the battle of the
Shahke. After a desperate fight, last
ing one hour and a half, the Russians
were repulsed. They left behind sixty
dead and some prisoners.
A severe bombardment Is continuing
to-day, the Russians using additional
heavy guns, but firing blindly. The
Japanese are responding lightly. There
is every evidence that both BideÃ are
preparing for what may prove the de
cisive battle of the war. Probably
fully one million men will be ready to
move when the battle is Joined.
The battle must be fought before a
general thaw comes, making the roads
Impassable for several weeks. The
Japanese troops are in excellent health
and spirits despite the long winter of
unaccustomed cold. A few Russian
soldiers are surrendering daily, the
number being largely increased the last
few days.
WITTMAN CASE
IS CONTINUED
Testimony Is Introduced to
Show Chinese Gamble, but
Chief Is Not Implicated
The trial of Chief of Police Wittman,
charged with dereliction of duty and
lncompetency, was continued before the
Police Commissioners at the Hall of
Justice last evening. Little testimony
of a nature that would tend to prove
the charges against the accused Chief
was introduced. Some of the evidence
would have served better in the case of
Sergeant of Police Bills, already con
victed and awaiting his fate. At the
hands of the board.
When the meeting 1 adjourned Com
missioner Reagan, In response to a
question from Attorney Kahn, an
nounced that the witnesses for the
prosecution were like "sands of the
sea," many in number, and the pros
pects are that the case will continue
several sessions.
Hugo Huedner, a guide, was the
first witness called. He stated that the
appearance of Chinatown, so far aB
gambling districts were concerned, had
changed considerably since Ellis was
removed and. Cook assumed charge of
the detail. No Chinese entered any of
the clubs and the lights in front of the
places had been extinguished. James
Lambert, a watchman employed by a
club at 41 Ross alley, followed Huedner
to the stand and, after describing his
duties and . the furnishing of the
"clubs," proceeded to make a state
ment that was injurious to the case of
Sergeant Ellis.
Lambert said that about the middle
of November Efllia approached him
while he was on duty and told him
to warn the members of the" club that
Chief Wittman was In' Chinatown.
Bills also enjoined him to close, the
place for a time. Lambert lost no tinie
in communicating with the "lookout"
and soon a stream of Chinese flowed
into the alley.
SAIiOMON TALKS.
Attorney Salomon then took the
stand and revealed the contents of a
letter he had written to Chief Wittmaa
in . November, 1903. Salomon had for
clients two Chinese, who desired to start
a gambling Institution at 630 Jackson
street. These men were warned by
other gamblers that they would hay?
to contribute $200 a month to a fund for
police protection and Salomon advised
them not to do so. When they started
. thÂ« club they were raided by : Sergeant
Campbell and his squad twi.ce within
one week, and it was not until after
they had informed the attorney that
they had concluded to pay the money
that they wpre allowed to run without
police interference. Wittmari removed
Campbell from Chinatown and Cook
WW put in his placo.
Stephen A. Byrne, a well-known col
lector for the gas company in that sec
tion, also noticed a change in China
town since Ellis and his- men had left,
and Henry B. Osgood, a guide, realized
the same condition of affairs. Osgood
was always conscientious in taking
parties through Chinatown and when
asked concerning the gambling dens he
designated them as "clubs and benev
olent associations," because hÂ© had

SHAKHETDN, Manchuria, March 1
(Wednesday).â A stubborn fight is
waging on the left wing. Vigorous at
tacks of the Japanese on the village
of Kudaza have been repulsed and the
Russians maintain their position,
thanks to the intervention of a relief
column which attacked the: Japanese
from the west after two passes had
been occupied. This column was hard
pressed by the Japanese and suffered
great losses. It advanced In detach
ments to the neighborhood of Obentu
pusa and was attacked thrice during
the night, at 11, midnight and 3 a. m.,
but repulsed all the Japanese on
slaughts.
To the westward the Japanese made
a night attack on Kutal Pass. Some of
the assaults were repulsed, but at 8 a.
m. the Russian advance guard vacated
two outworks which had been de
stroyed by the Japanese artillery and
retired to adjacent and better fortified
positions.
The Japanese attacked Nanshanpu
in Khandlensan district at â¢ a. m., but
were repulsed.

REGENTS WILL ESCAPE.
Attempt to Approve Oommlttee . Re-

SACRAMENTO, March 8. â By a
vote of 18 to 14 the Senate refused
this morning to reconsider the vote
by which the University of California,
investigating committee report was
defeated and the question is now fin
ally disposed of. Senator Snortridge
led the attack on the. report and Car
ter, chairman of the investigating
committee, defended It. When the
result was made known Carter said
that the Senate's action In sustaining
a systeaji of finance that had resulted
in such great loss to the university
would cause him to oppose the appro
priation of any moneys for the main
tenance of the college and that he
would vote against all bills providing
for such appropriations.
Shortridge, in his attack on the re
port, said the board of regents repre
sents the very flower of the best cit
izenship of California, whether con
sidered from any. standpoint, intellec
tual or moral. Tha adoption of the
report, he said, would Justify every
member of the board fn handing in.

said in conclusion, "and the greatest

gambling.
Sergeant Ellis was called to the stand
and Attorney Mogan was on guard to
protect his interests. Ellis admitted
that gambling was conducted fn some
of the clubs, but when asked what he
.did when he received such information
he declined to answer, on the ground
that It would Incriminate himself.
Attorney Kahh, for Wittman, stated
that he had no objection, but the
board did not insist upon an answer.
When asked about the Lambert mat
ter-Ellis said that it was possible he
mentioned the matter to the watch
man, but- not .wfth the intention of
warning the inmates of the club. El
lis said he once informed Wittman
that gambling was going on and that
the chief replied "I guess so." Then
came a stunning question for Ellis.
He was about to leave the stand when
Commissioner Reagan addressed this
remark to him:
"Sergeant Ellis, I want to ask a ques
tion. You may' nnswer it or you may
remain silent, jrst as you please. If
you decide to answer you may take as
long tÂ© consider as you desire. Will
ynu swear that to the best of your
ability you tried to suppress gambling
in Chinatown?"
There was a silence In the Commis
sioners' room for many seconds and
finally Ellis lifted his head and said,
"I decline to answer."
He was told to leave the stand and
he paÃsed out Â£o the corridor. . Joseph
A. Kelly and George Downey both spe
cial watchmen In Chinatown, testified
that the Chinese regarded Sergeant
Cook as possessed of supernatural pow
ers and that they had a superstitious
dread of him. For that reason he has
b^een able to suppress gambling. Dow
ney said that the heathens believe If
Cook touches one of them dire results/
wi.U follow and he related several inci
dents in support of his assertions. The
case was then postponed until next
Tuesday afternoon at 2 o'clock, and the
prosecution will continue its case.
Fierce Fighting With Heavy Guns About
Mnkden Brings Death to Hundreds.
â¢
RUSSIAN LINES ARE FORCED BACK TWO MILES
ST. PETERSBURG, March 8. Â«10
p. m.â The position of General KurÂ«
patkin's army is regarded as being
more or less critical. The real turning
movement which General Kuroki is op
erating in the mountains forty miles
eastward of Mukden seems to be mak
ing progress and at the same time
Field Marshal Oyama is also rolling
back the Russian left, while pounding
away at the Russian center with heavy
high-power guns. Poutiloff and Nov
gorod hills have been subjected to a
continuous three-day bombardment,
followed by an infantry attack, the
main Russian lines being forced to re
tire two miles to their sheltered
trenches. Some of the Russian news
paper correspondents anticipate an at
tempt to take the hills by storm.
General Kuropatkin is making des
perate efforts to cheok Kuroki, one of
whose columns has succeeded in work-
Ing around the extreme Russian left,
and reinforcements have been dis
patched in a northeasterly direction.
General Rennenkampf Is slowly retir
ing, fighting, taking advantage of the
broken, hilly country and contesting
every inch of ground.
While the Japanese are evidently
making progress there 1b nothing yet
to indicate that Field Marshal Oyama
will succeed in inflicting a decisive
blow, even if he forces Kuropatkin to
abandon Mukden. According to the re
ports current, which are not, however,
confirmed by the War Office, the with
drawals of stores and supplies north
ward from Mukden is already well un
der way. The War Office Insists that
no matter what the result of the re
mainder of the action, the Japanese
have again been too slow and that Ku
ropatkin has made sure of his line of
retreat. Except the moral effect of an
other retirement, the War Office offi
cials declare that the abandonment of
the present winter quarters eliminated
a great danger to the health of the
army as soon as the warm weather
sets in.

Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets give it both

bottle or Jar containing warm water
heated to 93 degrees (the temperature
of the body) and keep It at this tem-
perature for three and one-half hours '
ai the end of which time the egg will
be as completely digested as it would
have bean in the healthy stomach of a #:
hungry boy.
' The point of this experiment Is that Â»
â what Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets will

WASHINGTON. March . 2;â Among
the investigations; which the Federal
Government has on hand, and contem
plates 1b how . included . the manage
rrent of -. the -St; â¢ Louis Fair. â  Some
jrrmvÂ« complaints have been heard here
in the last-, few. days, and they will be i

which the Government commission, o.t ;
which. Senator-elect Thomas H. Carter ;
of Montana. Is chairman, is now; work-
Ing and which will be completed by j
June 1. The most serious of these com- \
plaints, are:: That the manager of the
Louisiana Purchase Exposition recent
ly sold property In which; the Govern
ment has a. third interest ; for â¢ about ;
one-quarter cf what it was-, worth;
that while the sale of the. property was]
to be made in the open it was. in real- ;
ity a secret transaction: that the prop- :
erty 'erred includes much more" '
than was advertised. . . . '-â  "_ ;-.
The : United States Government : has
one-thlfd Interest ; in the property of
the exposition company, the city of St.
Louis one-third and the company one-
third. 'â } When the fair was closed . the
plans were drawn up by the manage
ment for selling the buildings, which
had ; been, erected with the money an
propriated. by Congress, by St. Louis
and by the stockholders of the expos!-,
tion company. v Among the charges Is
one that the stock of the company was
not all paid in. but this "is . Indefinite,
and an expert Is now at work on the
bopks. which are eaid to be in a badly
mixed condition. The ground on which
the buildings are located was leased..
The buildings 'which the company had
a right to: sell Include all of the. great
exposition â¢ structures except . .three
erected by foreign Governments and
the States and buildings in which tHe
Government exhibit was housed. . The
machinery and a large part of the oth
/cx furnishings of these buildings^ were
to be included In the sale. .The sale
was advertised, and it . was the plan,
a? announced to the Federal commis
sion, to have the property go to the
highest bidder. It was all sold to the
Chicago Housewreckirig Company for
$400,000, and the assertion now : made by
other concerns who were willing to bid
Is that the sale was made in secret and
that there was no opportunity for open
bidding. Experts who have examined,
the reports have reported to members
of ..the Government commission that
they estimate the property to be worth
nearly . ' '00.000 and that : the Chicago
House wrecking Company will make on
the transaction at least 11,250,000. ".;;v
Carter would not discuss the skua- !
tion except to say that the Govern- â¢
ment commission was at work on the
report. .' The commission has not yet
lormuJated its charges because it feels
â¢hat the managers of the exposition
should first have an opportunity to
make a full explanation. The commif=-
Fjon report will first go to Congress,
because it was that body that author
ized the appropriations for the fair. ' '

OFFICERS HANG
INNOCENT MAN
Confession of Brother of
the Deceased Reveals Aw
ful Mistake of Authorities
Special Dispatch to The Ca.ll.
WASHINGTON. Perm., March 2.â
Crying and beating his head against
the walls of his cell, Adolph J. Bloch,
formerly of Philadelphia, is in the
county Jail to-night, having confessed
to having committed a murder for
which his brother was hanged in Allen
town two days ago.
Bloch, who for three months has
worked In a mill at Canonsburg under
the name of John White, this after
noon asked that the Sheriff of the
county be called to take him in charge.
He was given a preliminary hearing
before Justice Magill this evening and
committed to the county jail to await
orders from Allentown.
Eugene. B. Bloch was hanged last
Tuesday at Allentawn for the brutal
murder of a Mrs. Falsezinger at Allen
town. HÂ£ died proesting his inno
cence, declaring that a man whom he
did not know had cut the throat of
the woman and that he tried to save
her and was found by her body.
While in the mill this afternoon a
fellow workman was reading the paper
aloud and came to the story of the
hanging. Bloch cried out that he alone
had killed the woman, not his brother,
and collapsed utterly, saying that he
had not known his brother had even
been arrested for the crime, much less
convicted and hanged. He made a full
ennffspion.

MAKES DISPLAY
OF LIBERALITY
Senate Passes Sundry Civil
Appropriation Bill, Which
Disposes of $68,000,000
SEVERAL AMENDMENTS
Acceptance of Yosemite
Park From California Is
Provided For by Perkins
WASHINGTON, March 2.â The Sen
ate to-day passed the sundry civil
appropriation bill, carrying about 568,
000,000. Various amendments were
offered to the measure and most of
them were debated at length. There
also was discussion of the pure food
bill and Dolliver made a brief speech
in support of his resolution providing
for the appointment of a joint Congres
sional committee to investigate the
question of railroad rates. The reso
lution was referred to the Committee
cm Interstate Commerce.
At the night session the general de
ficiency bill, the last of the supply
measures, was considered by the Sen
ate. An amendment appropriating
$100,000 for the purchase of a site for
an army general hospital in Washing
ton was agreed to. The amendment
authorizing the assignment of retired
revenue cutter service officers to active
duty went out on a point of order by
Patterson.
A provision for the acceptance from
the State of California of Yosemlte
Valley as an addition to Yosemite
Park, which was presented by Perkins,
was incorporated in the bill.
Patterson presented an amendment
increasing from 5175,000 to 5200,000 the
appropriation for geological surveys.
The resolution was. antagonized by
Lodge, who said that notwithstanding
5100,000,000 had been spent on surveys
we have not yet secured a decent sur
vey of the country. He said the direc
tor of the Geological Survey was the
most successful money-getter in Wash
ington. The Geological Survey amend
ment was agreed to.
Other amendments were inserted, in
cluding one providing 59500 for mark
ing the spots where American soldiers
fell in China and Cuba. The bill was
then passed.
A conference on the river and har
bor bill was ordered, with Senators
Gallinger, Nelson and Berry as con
ferees.
Heyburn immediately called up the
pure food bill and addressed the Sen
ate on Its provisions. While talking
he was interrupted by many Senators
desiring to pass bills. Dolliver called
up his resolution providing for the ap
pointment of a commission, composed
of members of both houses of Con
gress, to investigate railroad rates, and
spoke in advocacy of it. The resolu
tion was referred to the Committee on
Interstate Commerce.
Senator Platt (Connecticut) offered a
number of amendments to the pure
food bill and discussed the general
provisions of the measure. He con
tended that the theory of the bill was
to punish the retailer, which was
wrong. His amendments were intended
to remedy these defects. He admitted
that if they were accepted very little
of the bill would be left.
Spooner also opposed the bill and was
still speaking when Hale interrupted
him to report the general deficiency
bill from the Committee on Appropria
tions.
The Senate at 5:52 p. m. went into
executive session and at 6 o'clock took
a recess until 8 p. m.
MONEY FOR INDIANS.
Senate Conferees Reach Partial Agree-
ment on Appropriation Bill.
WASHINGTON, March 2. â The con
ferees on the Indian appropriation bill
reported an agreement to-night on all
but three amendments. The first
strikes out the House provision re
moving the restrictions upon the alien
ation of lands of all allottees of any of
the five civilized tribes of Indians who
do not appear upon the rolls as full
blooded Indians, except minors and
except as to homestead. The second i 3
a Senate appropriation of $1,100,000
to carry into effect the treaty with the
Indians residing on the Colville Reser
vation in the State of Washington.
The other disagreement is the amend
ment appropriating $150,000 for the
irrigation of the lands of the Pima In
dians in Arizona.
The Senate receded from the Bard
amendment prohibiting the use of In
dian funds for the support of sectarian
or denominational schools and it goes
out of the bill.
STATEHOOD BILL.
Numerous Conferences Fail to Bring
About an Adjustment.
WASHINGTON. March 2. â Numer
ous conferences on the statehood bill
to-day again failed to bring about an
agreement by which legislation for
either one or two States may be had
af the present session. The onferees
adjourned until to-morrow at lla. m.,
without any proposition having been
advanced during the day that even ap
proaches promise of ultimately com
promising the difficulties.
For several days the Senate con
ferees have been proceeding on the
icea that it might be possible to set
an agreement for the acceptance of in*
House bill for two States, wnn tHe
amendment by Senator Foraker, maK
ing it possible for either Arizona or
New Mexico to reject the constitution.
Now this plan has been practically
abandoned because of opposition in
both houses.
SANTO DOMINGO TREATY.
President Will Send Special Message
to the Senate.
WASHINGTON. March 2. â Presi
dent Roosevelt will send to the Senate
next Monday a special message relat
ing to the Santo Domingo treaty,
which is pending before that body.
The nature of the message has not
been divulged, but it will present in
conrise form the circumstances of the
negotiations of the convention and the
arguments on which its ratification is
urged by the administration.

Discussion of Armor Plate
Investigation in House
Results in Serious Charge
WASHINGTON, March 2.âGovern
ment participation in the exposition to
celebrate the first permanent settle
ment of English-speaking people on
the western hemisphere in the vicinity
of Jamestown, Va., orv v the waters of
Hampton Roads, was provided by the
House to-day when, by a vote of 192
to 91. the bill for that purpose was
passed under a suspension of the rules.
The amount appropriated is $250,000.
To put the bill through by a two-thirds
vote was necessary, and this was ob
tained only after a spirited debate.
Conference reports on the fortifica
tions and agricultural appropriation
bills were agreed to. The conference
report on the naval appropriation bill,
after being partially agreed to, was
sent back for further conference, after
a lively debate over the question of
investigating the cost of armor plate
and the building of an armpr plate
plant. Amendments by Vandiver of
Missouri designed to have the investi
gation conducted by a special naval
board were voted down, as was also
a motion by Rixey of Virginia to con
fer in the Senate amendment to have
the investigation made by the Secre
! tary of the Navy. In supporting the
amendment Hughes of New Jersey as
j serted that 'in the last six years $22,
â  000,000 had been stolen from the Gov
! eminent by the Carnegie and Bethle
! horn plants."
Among other items still in dispute is
the one providing for an increase of
1200 officers and men in the marine
corps.
Shortly after 5:30 o'clock the House
rested until 9 p. m., the evening session
being devoted to conference reports
and bills of minor importance

HOPE TO FIND
M'KOWEN BOND
Pacific Surety Company's
liability Is , Involved in
This Lost Document
ITS TERMS IMPORTANT
Instrument May Enable the
Univei-sity^ to Recover
Several Thousand Dollars
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, March 1.
When the case of the Regents of the
University of California against the
Pacific Surety Company to recover
$5000 on the bond of the former secre
tary, W. A. McKowen, came np for
trial this morning before Judge S. P.
Hall, the statement was made by At
torney C. B. Snook that he had been
unable to find the bnd and that he
had been greatly hindered in the prep
aration of the case in consequence.
It was said by Attorney F. P. Deer
ing for the surety company that the
main point of disagreement between
his client and the regents was that the
company was not responsible longer
than three months after the expiration
of the bond, while on the part of the
university it is said that it was stipu
lated' in the bond that the time limit
was pix months.
At this juncture former Expert J. J.
Herr made the announcement that Mrs.
A. S. Hallidie he thought can tell
whore the missing document is. Her
husband was the chairman of the
finance committee of the Board of
Regents and he had the bond. On his
death Mrs. Hallidie turned it over to
some person, from whom she took a
receipt. McKowen's defalcation was
discovered about five months after the
bond had expired and if the bond can
be found the State may be gainer to
the extent of $5000. Court was imme
diately adjourned and Attorney Snook
was given opportunity to try to re
cover the missing document.

by the club, which holds under a lease.
Adjoining the building on the west

the Birthplace of the University
of California.
OAKLAND, March 2. â College Hall,
Twelfth and Harrison streets, one of

ALAMEDA'S
NEW SHERIFF
IS BARNET
FRANK BARNET. APPOINTED
SHKRIFF OF ALAMELIA COUNTY
BY THE SUPERVISORS.
Popular Native Son Wias
Position Created by
Deatu.
OAKLAND. March 2â Frank Bar
net, former deputy clerk of the Su
preme Court, was to-day, by unani
mous vote, appointed Sheriff of Ala
meda County by the Board of Super
visors to fill the vacancy caused by
the death of John N. Bishop.
Baraet qualified at once by filing a
surety company bond, which was ap
proved by the Judges of the Superior
Court. The new Sheriff this afternoon
temporarily reappointed all of tfte.pres
ent force of deputies, ' except John
Simons and Fred Murdock. George
Wales of Newark, a deputy under for
mer Sheriff Oscar Rogers, gets one of
these places; the other will be offered
to City Councilman W. J. Baccus.
Sheriff Barnet announced that he had
not considered any other permanent
appointments. It is understood that
Under Sheriff J. J. Hanifin Jr. will be
retained, and possibly Chief Jailer
Harry Clark.
Two petitions for the appointment of
Sheriff were read at the special meet
ing of the Supervisors this morning.
The first was that of Barnet, the other
was from Harry A. Borchert, steward
of the Receiving Hospital. A resolu
tion naming Barnet was introduced
and the roll call proceeded with Super
visor J. M. Kelley first for Barnet.
Supervisor Rowe's vote was passed
until after Supervisors Homer and
Talcott and Chairman Mitchell had
voted for Barnet. Then Rowe made it
ununimous.
Sheriff Barnet is a native of Oakland,
the son of John Barnet, a retired po
liceman. He is a past president of
Local No. 131, Painters and Decorators
of America. In politics he has been
active and is a strong Republican. He
was engrossing clerk of the Assembly
during the session of 1897. He served
two years as Deputy County License
Collector from July 1, 1897. Barnet re
signed that posi to become deputy
clerk of the Supreme Court, a position
he held until November 1, 1900. Later
he was appointed stenographer in the
District Attorney's office, and he gives
up that post for the important one to
which he was appointed to-day. Sheriff
Barnet has been a leader in the Native
Sons of the Golden "West. He is mar
ried and resides at 49 Eighth street.
Councilman Baccus said to-night
that he had been offered the naming
of a Deputy Sheriff, but should not ac
cept a position himself.

be asked to suspend exercises for the
two lower classes on the Saturday the

ceding Charter day, so that the men
of both classes can build the big "C.

the Associated Students will write at
once to President Wheeler, who is now
in the East, for the desired permission.
The women of the lower classes wiH
be expected to furni3h luncheon for the
men after their labor of mixing and
carrying the cement up to the top of
the hill and there putting it in the form
of a "C." On | Charter' day the fresh

MINERS SCORE
GREAT SUCCESS
Memorial to the President
of United States Meets
With Favorable Response
GEEAT WORK PLANNED
Geological Survey to Make
Study of Sedimentation
by Bivers of California
President Benjamin of the California
Miners' Association has been notified
by Secretary Hitchcock of the Depart
ment of the Interior that the United
States Geological Survey will assist in
carrying out word in this State that
was suggested in a memorial addressed
by the association to President Roose
velt.
In the memorial referred to the
California Miners' Association de
clared that many millions of dollars 1
â worth of gold are idly buried in an
cient river channels in this State, under
such conditions that they cannot be
profitably worked either by dredging,
by drifting or by any other process
than hydraulic mining; that restrain
ing the hydraulic mining in this State
has enforced idleness on property to
the value of more than $100,000,000;
that the unavoidable effects of natural
erosion and sedimentation have been
ignored by courts and by farmers,
who have charged all the injury hy
draulic mining; that a rational appli
cation of the laws governing the depo
sition of sediment from torrential
streams will permit hydraulic mining
and agriculture to be carried on, not
only without prejudice to each other,
but with advantage to both; also that
the question of erosion and sedimenta
tion is primarily a geological one.
The Miners' Association requested the
President of the United States to have
the following matters investigated
through the United States Geological
Survey: *
First â The most favorable sites for reser
voirs for water, whereby destructive floods
may bo averted and the waters stored and
utilized for the benefit of agriculture, mining
and other industries.
Second â The selection of suitable tracts of
waste lands and of the most suitable means
whereby the detritus from torrential streams
may be deposited on such waste lands, so as
to reclaim them and convert them gradually
Into lands suitable for forestry and other ag
ricultural purposes, and at the same time to
remove from such streams their burden of
detritus so that they may cease to be a men
ace to the navigable waters of the State.
President Benjamin has carried on an
extensive correspondence relative to
this topic, the leading one before the
recent convention of the California
Miners' Association. Secretary Hitch
cock's letter contains the statement
that "the director of the Geological
Survey and his assistants will endeavor
in all practical ways to assist the asso
ciation and will try to bring about,
particularly through the reclamation
service, the attainment of the desired
ends."
WESTERN ADDITION
SHROUDED IN DARKNESS
Remarkably Quick Work of
Electricians.
The residents of the Western Addition,
from Devisadero street to the ocean and
from Geary street to the bay, were
ehrouded in absolute darkness last night
for a' little over one hour. As soon as
the gloomy darkness fell like a pall over
the district every telephone in the sec
tion affected was set in motion to ascer
tain from the office of the electric light
company what the matter was.
As soon as this news was conveyed to
headquarters all the available men con
nected with the electrical branch of the
city's lighting plant were called into ac
tion. To the credit of the workmen con
nected with the gas and electrical light
company, the cause of darkness was as
certained to be the burning out of the
principal feeder on California street,
near Fillmore. The thorough knowledge
of the men connected with the electrical
light company soon had the damaged
feeder repaired and light restored to the'
9000 lamps which were in a black condi
tion a few minutes previously. The first
glimmer of light disappeared exactly at
6 15 p. m.. and inside of one hour they
were made to glow as before. The re
pairing of the defective feeder, in addi
tion to locating the same in the short
space of time allotted to the staff, is con
sidered to be of the highest merit of j
workmanship by the officials of the com- '
pany. â  â¢ i
Dies of a Fractured Skull.
An elderly man, who gave his name
as Frank Smith, died in th^ Alms
house yesterday morning from the ef
fects of a fractured skull. He came
there February 8 to have a lacerated
wound of his head dressed. He rap
idly became worse and soon lost con
sciousness. On arrival at the Alms
house he. explained that he had been
struck by a street car. On his person
was found a contract between At

in which Pratt agreed to prosecute the
railway company on a contingency
fee of half the damages recovered. It
is believed that the name of the de
cedent was Sheridan.

Clever Actress
to Appear at
California.
The California Theater announces
the engagement of Margaret Anglin
and her complete New York company
for an extended season here. The deal
was negotiated by Manager Ackerman
and provides for what promises to be
one of the most remarkable repertoire
seasons ever played in this city. Her
manager, '""Mr. Perley, has equipped
Miss Anglin with a cast of unusual
excellence and a repertoire of wide
range, including eight plays that are
new to San Francisco theater-goers
and all but two of them new to the
American stage. Miss Anglin will also
give Wednesday matinees, at which
she will present an entire change of
bill at each performance.
The season will open on Monday
evening, March 20, with a new emo
tional drama, entitled "Zira," by J.
Hartley Manners and Henry Miller.
The piece has been staged in New York
under the personal direction of Mr. Mil
ler. Mr. Perley is authority for the
statement that it affords Miss Anglin
greater opportunities than even "Mrs.
Dane's Defense."
The other plays include "Mariana,"
a strong emotional drama from the
Spanish of Jose Echegaray, played
with great success in London last sea
son by Mrs. Patrick Campbell; "The
Marriage of Kitty," a bubbling French
comedy, adapted by Cosmo Gordon
Lennox, which ran for two seasons in
Paris, three hundred nights in London
and seven months last season in New
York; "The Eternal Feminine," a
quaintly original comedy, in which
Miss Anglin has been starring this
season; a new play by the prominent
Irish playwright. Desmond O'Hara; a
new emotional drama by an American
authoress and a new comedy by an
English authoress. It is rumored that
Miss Anglin will produce, during her
engagement here, a special dramatiza
tion of Miss Miriam Michelson's strong
novel, "In the Bishop's Carriage."
The special bills for the Wednesday
matinees will include the following
plays: A new and very modern ver
sion of "Frou Frou," freely, adapted
from the original French; a. magnifi
cent production of Shakespeare's
"Cymbeline," "Magda," "Adrienne Le

WOULD HONOR
BARD'S MEMORY
Shakespeare Lovers All Over
World to Be Asked for
Contributions to Project
TO ERECT AN INSTITUTE
It Is Proposed to Build in
London a Fitting Monu
ment to Greatest of Poets
LONDON, March 2. â Shakespeare
levers the world over are about to be
i asked to contribute toward a memorial
to the bard, which it is planned to set
I up in London and which it is hoped
' to make really worthy of his memory.
At present there is not even an ade
j quate statue to Shakespeare in the
1 English capital and about a year ago
j Kichard Badger, the philanthropist,
f offered a substantial sum toward the
erection of a monument on condition
that the London County Council would
grant a suitable site. This the Council
agreed to do, but declared that it j
could not undertake to collect the ad- |
ditional funds necessary to build the
statue. So a few .veeks ago Shakes
peare lovers in London got together
and formed a provisional committee to
consider ways and means of rousing
interest in the project. This commit
tee, of which Israel Gollancz, univer
sity lecturer in English at Cambridge,
is honorary secretary, has held several
! meetings, as the result of which it has
I been decided to attempt much more
I than the mere erection of a statue in
; London. Accordingly the provisional
' committee is about to give way to a I
j general, one which it is hoped to make '
! up of leading men and women of the
day in all parts of the empire, the
United States and of other countries.
This general committee will be con
stituted at a public meeting at the j
Mansion House, London, on the last j
day of this month. Regarding the
form of the proposed memorial. Pro
fessor Gollancz says:
We aim at the establishment of a great
Shakespeare house, to be devoted primarily to
the furth -ranee of the study and interpreta
tion of the poet's works, and also to serve as
a recognized center for humane learning gen
erally. Therefore, if the response is adequate.
it is hoped that there may be erected in Lon
don a Shakespeare house or institute, with a
Shakespeare library, a lecture theater and a
central hall to receive a fitting statue of
Shakespeare, statues of other famous men be-
I ing added from time to time.
MUCH MONEY NEEDED.
Of course to carry out this ambitious
plan large funds will be necessary and
the organizers of the project hope that
the appeal may come home to every
one, not only to the rich, but also to
those of limited means. Say the com
mittee: "The memorial should repre
sent the world's homage to the poet,
the world's tribute to his genius."
To begin with, Richard Badger has
made a subscription of $15,000 to the
fund, and one of 52500 for the general
working expenses of a public appeal.
;In order to encourage further dona
tions it is planned to organize a
"Shakespeare Commemoration," to be
observed In all parts of the world dur
; ing Shakespeare week, which com
mences with the poet's birthday, April
23. One of those most interested in
this movement is Lord Avebury, the
former Sir John Lubbock, who has
consented to act as treasurer of the
memorial fund.
"John Strange Winter," who most
people know to be Mrs. Arthur Stan
nard. has just told how she came to
choose her pen-name. This disclosure
has been made in the course of a dis
cussion on the "feminine note in fic
tion," in which Mrs. Stannard has
taken part. It had been asserted that |
the choice by many women writers of
masculine names was proof of the
sex's "memetic quality." But "John
Strange^ Winter" denies this. "My
very burdensome nom-de-guerre," she
says, "was forced upon me by men.
I wrote tales for years under a femi
nine pseudonym, but when I aspired to j
volume issue the astute publishers ab
solutely declined to publish my first
book unless I chose a masculine name â
'the more real sounding the better.' It
was not pleasant to me, but I was
practical enough to give way on the
pomt â and have suffered ever since."
RUSKIX'S HOUSE DOOMED.
' American devotees of Ruskin will re
gret to learn that the house he occu
pied for many years in the London
suburb of Herne Hill, is in danger of
being demolished to make way for a
modern villa. The house which long
stood opposite it, a fine old place with
mullioned windows and slate roof,
whose sole crime was that it was old
fashioned, has just been pulled down.

Special Dispatch to Tba Ca.ll.
NEW YORK, March 2.â A cargo of
wild animals destined for a circus ar
rived by the steamship Lugano from
South America to-v4ay. Animal food
aboard ship gave out before this port
was reached and the animals were rav
enously hungry-
A reporter incautiously brushed close
to a cage wherein two leopards were
penned and in an instant a paw shot
out and the reporter's overcoat hung
in ribbons from shoulder to pocket.
Before he could realize what had hap
pened there was another lightning-like
stroke from the cage and this time the
animal's claws became entangled in the
coat.
Several attendants flung themselves
upon the newspaper man and tried to
drag him away, but the leopard was
stronger than the lot and was pulling
him nearer to the cage, when the keep
er seized an Iron bar and brought it
down with such crushing force on the
animal's paw as to compel it to release
its victim.

IGNORING INTERSTATE LAW.
op HE l Eterstate. Commerce Commission has decided apinst the
I ! Sacta Fe Railway in the. question, of orange freights t>om Cali
"â â¢ fornia. .TTic decision also includes the Southern Pacific, and is
to the effect, that "the" rates are too high, and that the shipper and
not the railroad should control- the routeingjof the fruit. This comes
st. the end. of a long' fight in tvhich both sides have been heard by
the commission. ...-'.' .'â¢â¢"
...The Southern . Pacific has not yet declared what course it will
pursue, but the Santa Fe is- more prompt. President Ripley of the
latter road fn.an. interview in. Chicago says: "Of course we shall
ignore the decision of the commission, and rely on the courts for
justice, for we desire. to be just.*'. .
,: There iÂ« more in this than appears in the lines. It is. perfectly
safe to :gr-ore .a. decision of the commission, for its powers are lim
ited. It may hear and decide- such cases, but the proceeding is
hardly rr,ore than academic,, for the .body has no power to enforce its
decrees. . The commission was an experiment. It was not originally
clothed with' power to enforce its decisions and has. remained merely
a tneahs of securfrrg publicity. â¢_ In that respect it has done good
service, and has put many issues in shape to be considered by the
courts. But issues cannot go from it to the courts by the ordinary
incidents of appeal. Parties interested must reach a judicial finding
by. beginning iri <t court of original jurisdiction from which they
may reach, the Supreme. Court. of the United States. It will be
seen, then* that both the railroads and the citizens who complain
of ihiir rates of . policy have to stand all. of the expense of a trial
before the commission, the cost of witnesses and the fees of attor
neys;' to- present and prove a case before a tribunal whose decisions
are not a finality, and which cannot put the parties a single step
irearer to a finality than they were before they joined issues.
V It is to the interest of the railroads and of the people to change
all this.- The spirit of the Jaw is against compelling any one to do
a vain. thing, and that spirit is violated when corporations and citi
zens are compelled to stand, the expense of a trial that cannot end
in- anything useful. It should be seen that the Interstate Commerce
Commission has accomplished all that ft can as* an experiment. It
has accustomed the corporations and the country to the processes of
an examination by one authority, representative of the National
Government j. and . has trained everybody in the preparation of a
case'\arid thr presentation of evidence. All of this is a foundation
â¢upon which to buijd a tribunal suggested by the deficiencies and the
usefulness of this, ' â  - . .
. â¢ . When the recommendations of the President are examined it
will be seen .that they run to the creation of such a tribunal. It
should be a court of first instance, with its procedure denned in the
act creating it. It should also be a mixed tribunal. in its member
ship^ \ A majority of its members should be. skilled lawyers and their
associates "-should be skilled in -transportation and the general me
chanics and mathematics of the railroad business. An appeal should
lje â 'â¢'-direct from this court of first instance to the Supreme Court of
.the .United States, and every process from the filing of a suit to
perfecting, ail appeal should.be safeguarded against technicality and
delay. .â ':.â¢â¢â â¢â .' ' . â  . â¢*â¢"..â 
'Th*. railroads: and the' people by this time understand that the
property of both is 'touched in the making of rates and that property is
put 'under judicial protection by the fourteenth amendment of the
â¢Federal .constitution. It is :thjs. knowledge that inspires President
Ripley's decision to submit- to no decree affecting the property that
he- represents, except a judicial decree. He is perfectly right and
within .his, rights. If he, representing property, assent to. a control
affecting it seriously, that is not judicial, he would weaken the safe
guards of all property and would be transferring it from judicial to
executive or legislative control, depriving it of the judicial protection
guaranteed by the constitution. His purpose is no less protective of
his "own- property than it is of the property of the contesting fruit
growers; [ His conclusion, is in line with the spirit of American law.
however rrruch it. may be a present disappointment to the orange
growers.' The incident. is of. vast. importance, not only to California
but' to .the whole country. It .is. the beginning of an end which will
bring order, out of chaos and make straight that which is crooked.
It will finally appear to everybody that the President saw far into
this great question. On one side of it is socialism,- as may be plainly
seen- in the- declarations of Senator Patterson. Mr; Hearst and Mr.
Bryan. If it be. left for a socialistic solution all of the wisdom of
the law and all Of its safeguards of property will be thrown to the
winds and, in the language of Mr. Jack London, "All property will
.be confiscated." Against this is the wise projection of legal princi
ple* to cover the new problems that inhere in the system of trans
portation, power to make rates, and in the combinations of capi
tal. This is the policy of the .President, and the country must choost
between the&e two, for there is no middle ground. The orange rate
case may well prove to have been an*epoch making contest. â¢
OUR KORMAL SCHOOL.
*THHE. people of San Francisco are well pleased by the offer of the
Board of Supervisors to give a site for the Normal School build
ing. or to contribute $50,000 in addition to the long delayed
:>rovide a thoroughly modern normal school
-
B Francisco is growing rapidry in many ways and unless bur
school facilities keep up with the march of progress they will be left
hopelessly in the rear. In no respect do they require betterment
more than in the perfect equipment of this normal school. It is en
tirely proper that the city contribute a site or money. The State
was presented a site at Chico for that normal school, and we be
lieve that similar assistance was given by the communities where
our other normal schools are located. This city should not be less
public tpiritcd than Chico and other places. When the school asks for
more money from the State its case will be strengthened by the
contribution made by the city. The people would willingly stand a
larger donation than Is proposed. The faculty of the school have
done noble work, beneficial to the public schools, under great diffi
culties, and they are entitled to a jubilee.
The State appropriation bill will reach the Governor this week,
and if there be any doubt of his attitude in the matter it will be
helpful to ih* school that San Francisco leaves no mistake possible
about her position and helpful purpose. We have no doubt that
Governor Pardee will act for the interests of the public schools and
sign the bill, and he will be glad to know that this city, by its
Board of Supervisors* stands with him and gives a substantial addi
â¢ to the amount appropriated by the State.
It is exceedingly difficult to understand the obstacles which confront those
who advocate the creation and enforcement of laws restricting and regulating
the iaoor of children. Upon rio ground in the entire realm of morals or
economic* can the system of child labor be Justified. The moral objections
to It seem self-evident. The economic objections should be only leas so. â

CAPTURED
FRANK H. SWEET
.â¢ â |âHROW up your hands, j
* * j quick!"
I Brad obeyed the command
" promptly, without looking to
*cc whence it came. That
much he had learned from his life in
the West. But as bis eyes found the
beautiful face beyond the firmly held j
rifle barrel, bis hand Cropped Involun
tarily to his hat to remove it. As it
did m there came a sharp report^ and
a stinging sensation in his ana.
That will convince you I mean
â what I say." cam* sternly from the
girl. "Now up with your hands again,
quick! The next time I shall not aim
to fire between your arm and head, j
but to hit." )
Brad smiled grimly. Evidently the j
sudden motion of his arm had caught :
the bullet which was merely Intended :
to graze It; and from the excruciating' j
pain and his inability to raise the arm j
from Its limp position at hie side he ]
realized that the bone was shattered. j
"Throw them up, " repeated the girl i
Impatiently, "or I ?ha3l shoot."
No need for that." drawled Brad. '
"for I could have drawn and used my
revolver before this. Just you tell me '
what to do, and I'll do it. No use ,
monkeying with the -hands up' busi- i
cess any more."
He waited stolidly, half expecting j
another shot. But it oid not come, j
The girl was looking at him unde
cidedly.
"WpII," she conceded at length. "I !
don't know as it is really necessary i
for your hands to remain up. I am I
not afraid. In spite of what you say !
I could kill you half a dozen times be- j
fore you could draw and level a 3
weapon. In all fairness, I advise you!
not to make the attempt. Now "re- I
move your revolvers carefully, - with )
the muzzles toward the ground, and 'â 
drop them beside your rifle. There, !
that is right," as the weapons were
slipped from the belt and dropped to
the ground. "Now walk twenty paces
down the valley and remain standing
with your back toward me. I will
pick up your weapons and restore
them in due time."
"Too much for you to carry all of
them." remonstrated Brad. "My rifle
Ik mighty heavy. Better fire -It off
and hand it over to me."
"I will attend to them," sharply. 1
"You are talking too much. Walk
forward now, twenty paces."
As he started to obey there came a
savage growl and he half turned. In
stantly the rifle muzzle was looking
hfm in the eyes. "None of that," the
girl admonished; "and let me add that
I shall not give you much more ad
vice."
"But the bear "
"Th- bear is in a trap and perfectly
safe." curtly. "And "
"Then let me kill him for. you and
tr.ke off the pelt," urged Brad eagerly,
and he turned half around.
The girl's eyes were as steelly as the
barrel of her rifle. "I shall not par
ley with you any more," shÂ£ said.
"If you do not turn instantly and obey
my orders I shall fire. I understand â !
your wish to take off the skin. You |
had already planned that, but did not \
expect to find me here to mar pre- :
vious successes. Now turn." I
Brad did so promptly. â¢ .
A moment later he heard her gath
ering up the weapons, then: "Now
walk straight toward that house you
can see among the trees."
Half way to the house Brad called
over his shoulder:
"Would you mind explaining that
remark about previous successes?"
The girl was silent.
"Struck me as sort of mysterious,"
Brad went on reflectively, "seeing
we're strangers and I've never been in
the country before. Though, of
course" â after waiting a few mo
ments â "you are not believing much I
say. just now; But there's another
thing I'd like to ask"â after a long
pause â "did you ever hear of a man
shooting through his pockets
Receiving no answer to this, he
continued coolly: "You see, folks out
this way have to get into habits like
that. Why, I know persons who could

Hrawing and taking aim. And that
reminds me, did you notice after I
dropped my hands that the right on<Â»
has been In its pocket most of the
time?"
What do you mean?" sharply,
'that you have a revolver there?"
"Sometimes I meet up with cases
like this when I do not have time to
draw in the regular way," said Brad
reflectively. 'Then it is convenient to
have a â¢weapon lying loose in the
pocket. I have ruined a lot of clothes
practicing: that way."
"Have you a revolver lying there
now?"
Yes, and had you been a desper
ado I might have used it. Here it is."
And he half turned, tossing the re
volver at her feet. Involuntarily the
muzzle of her rifle lowered.
"Why did you not shoot me if you
could?" ehe demanded.
Shoot a girl like you? Oh. LÂ»ord:"
They walked on for several rod*?,
then he railed again over hi? shoul
der. "Would you mind repeating that
remark about previous successes ?"
"Why, you have been coming to
the mouth of the valley and removing
ekins from the bears we caught in
ottr trap?. This would have made
filx, only as poon as I found the griz
zly was caught I went up there to
watch." The girl tried to speak stern
ly, but Brad fancied he could detect
dooÃt in her voice.
"The grizzlies caught our cattle,"
th<* girl added after a few moments,
"and they all seemed to enter the val
ley through the gully. That's why
we set trace there."
"And are there no men here for such
work?"
She hesitated, but only for a mo
ment. Apparently the voluntary Pur
render of the third revolver had dis
turbed her self-confidence.
"My father was thrown from his
horse last week and had his leg
broken. ' she answered, "and the only
man beside him is a half-breed we
hire. He is busy elsewhere to-day."
"You are taking me to your father?"
"Yâ es, that was my intention: but
I don't feel quite as sure now. If
you will tell me you had nothing
whatever to do with the bears, IâlI â I
suppose you could go back. I would
not like to make -a mistake."
"It Is impossible for me to go back
now," said Brad decidedly. "You see.
DO ANIMALS
THINK?
"Animals don't think, eh?" remark
. | Ed a gentleman the other day, speak- ,
; ing of the statement of a well-known j
i authority to that effect. "Well, when ;
1I1 I was a kid down on the farm I saw j
indisputable evidence that they not J
only think, but scheme, connive, elect
delegates, hold conventions, order
j strikes and all that sort of thin?.
"On our farm was a big white goat- \
On the farm adjoining was a large
black goat. Both could jump fences j
like a fox hunter and It wasn't long |
before they came together in one of j
the greatest head-cracking contests j
you ever saw. Our goat finally won I
out. and the black, cast down but not 1
dismayed, took a hustle back over the j
fence to his own domain. ;
"A few days after that a magnificent 1
bull on our farm got into an argument j
with the white goat. The bull made a
I few remarks in his lingo, the goat j
called him a snoozer in his and then j
they squared off for strenuous action. J
Those who were watching the coming j
t contest expected to see the smaller I
animal gored up into a mangled goat
steak, but they didn't know the stay-
Ing powers of Whltey. The black goat
was looking through the line fence
with a feeling of satisfaction, for he
{ figured it out that he was about to be
] avenged.
i "Weil. that white goat was as light j
.'â  es a dancing master on his feet and j
j hefty of head, and while the bull was ;
j porting out a soft spot to place his j
hookers the goat landed between his
I eyes with a crash that made old Beef j
! Trust howl. Billy quickly followed up j
{ his advantage and landed again and
{ again, while the bull hadn't got in a j
"j single hook. At the end of ten mm- I
{ utes Beefsteak had business in some
other part of the field..
"Here's where the thinking part
i comes in. As soon as the battle was
over the black goat called to-the white
goat and a moment later they were in
earnest conversation through the nine
l rail fence. The blkck goat patted the
1 white goat on the back, so to speak,
and told him he was the best ever. He
| also told him how the bull on the ad
[ \ Joining farm was always picking a
; fight with him and chasing him all
i j over the pasture. The white goat
shook his head knowingly, evidently
;! entered Into some sort of an agree
i ment, and walked away.
j j "Two or three days later the goats
! I met again at the line fence, and. to the
I astonishment of the farmhands, the
j black goat Jumped into our pasture j
I ] and our white goat Jumped over Into i
â¢; the pasture of the farm adjoining. No '
;j sooner had the neighbor's bull set eyes
' on our goat than he came -for him
,<! like an Atlantic City flyer. But Billy j
; ' was ready and waiting, and in just ten j
1 minutes he was the worst walloped
â  1 bull in ten counties.
"I "Billy did not return home at once,
1 j but- remained nearly a week and kept
'. the bull licked day and night. Finally j
' I the goats again met at the line fence, j
1 when our goat received the undying j
; gratitude of the black goat and both, j
â¢ returned to their respective homes.
'j â  "Oh. yes, animals think some, for
' you notice, that our Billy didn't tackle j
1 the Job of whipping the neighbor's â¢
bull until he had recovered from the]
; first battle and was fit for the fray." â j

LOVELY WOMAN AND HER RIGHT TO VOTE
One Says State Solons Should Enact a Law Providing: That
All Women "Shall Have Husbands and Littie. Children/'
and Another Comes Out for Woman as "The Proposer'"
To the Editor of The Call:
The president of the State University
at Berkeley has been giving the club
men and bachelors some very emphatic
talk. Now it Is a well known fact
that the public press has more Influ
ence as a maker of public opinion than
all else. And now it has a great work
before it. The State solons have de
cided that woman cannot vote, but
that 1b a small part of a woman's life,
while every woman loves a home of
her own. where she can be the head of
the domestic life. It is her natural
place. Her Creator fitted her for it. 1
and when she is not there she is out ;
of her sphere. No woman likes to have'
her holiest feelings ridiculed, or made
the butt of coarse jokes.
If public opinion would Rive her the
liberty of selecting her own husband,
and the liberty of proposing- to the
man whom she loves and desires to
wed, there would not be so many
bachelors and clubmen for President
Wheeler to condemn. ,
So many of the men of to-day are
so much occupied in the chase for
wealth that all else is forgotten until
the habit of living without a home be
comes so fixed that when leisure comes
to them in later years they have no
idea of what a home is like, or the
comfort or pleasures of a fireside. In
addition they have lost their courage,
or are broken in health, and feel that
to ask a woman to share their life
with them would be to thrust a burden
on the woman. 1

ACTOR SIDESTEPS CASHIER
DURING HIS "REST."
EVADES PAYMENT OF
TWO BITS FOR MEAL
TELLS TALE OF GOLD THAT VAXISHED
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
"With a propitiatory smile wreath
ing his classic countenance, Victor
Sterling, histrion, pleaded not guilty
to the charge of defrauding an inn
keeper. Police Judge Mogan ignored
the kowtow to his personal and magis
terial dignity and coldly instructed the
prosecution to go ahead.
Charles K. Blender, restaurateur at
3^ Fourth street, was the complaining
witness. He swore that the defend
ant, after consuming 25 cent*' worth
Qf viands in the Cafe Blender, at
tempted to evade paying for the same
â¢caking past the cashier's desk
and to the street. But a vigilant chief
waiter observed the strategic move
ment and checkmated It. The foiled
actor, having no money, was forth
with consigned to th. custody of a
policeman.
Mr. Sterling's tall and shapely figrur^
was In charming pose as his misde
meanor was recounted. "With shoul
ders and head thrown back and arms
foldedâ a la the opulent villain who
stands "up stage" and mockingly in
forms the humble heroine that he
holds the mortgage on the old home
stead and will surely foreclose if she
refuses to be his wife â harkened
to the recital and then put in his de
fense. His wealth of black and glossy
hair waved in consonance with his
denial* that he Intended to defraud,
and his right hand stole into the
bosom of his tightly buttoned raglan
and nestled there as he unfolded his
version of how the unfortunate affair
came to pass. Before adducing ex
planation of his Inability to meet a
demand for two â ha: ha! the
paltriness of the sum was laughable â
he would like to inform the court that
he had Just concluded a highly suc
cessful engagement as a member of
the company headed by Miss Blanche
Bates and that since the severance of
his connection with the Justly famous
aggregation of legitimate mummers he
had been "resting." If the court were
cognizant â¢ of â¢ those facts, he opined,
his part in the incident of the cafe
might appear less discreditable.
When he entered the rotisserle, Mr.
Sterling narrated, he had in his pos
session two five-dollar gold coins, con
tained in a purse which was confined
in a rear pocket of nis pantaloons.
While he wag seated at the table the
purse by some means opened and as
he shifted about in his chair the coins
rolled out and into the pocket, which,
alae! contained a hole sufficiently large
to permit of their egress. His
modest meal finished he arose and
sauntered toward the- cashier, draw
ins; forth his purse as he did so, and
then he discovered he was penniless.
The coins had trundled down the in
terior of a trousers leg to the floor,
where they were found and kept by
seme dishonest personâ maybe a
waiter. That was the plain, unvar
nithed truth of how he came to be
caught in such an embarrassing, not to
say humiliating, predicament. Surely
the court could not suspect him of be-
Inc a deliberate swindler?
Then the restaurateur spoke again,
saying that if It had not been the
fourth time Mr. Sterling had at
tempted to e^ade payment for his food
he might have been less harshly dealt
with. Indeed, no longer ago than last
Saturday eveningr, he ate 40 cents'
worth and then sidestepped the cash
counter. However, the prosecution did
not desire to send him to Jail. All it
wanted was ths money he owed it
Would a dollar be accepted as pay
ment in full? Sure.
Dollar paid by defendant's attorney
and case dismissed by order of bench.

For several hours of Wednesday aft
ernoon the telephone at police head
quarters was kept busy conveying
complaints from bartenders who had
been defrauded by "Garibaldi" Flynn.
veteran vagabond. All the messages
were to the same effect â that Mr.
Flynn had ordered and consumed a
drink and hastened away without pay
ing for itâ and each supplementary re
quest that a shrewd and trusty po
liceman be detailed to capture the
daring miscreant was promptly com
plied with. Half a dozen of the bright
est and best men on the force were
seeking Mr. Flynn in the region east
of Montgomery street, when no less
distinguished a man-hunter than De
tective Captain Burnett collared "Gari
baldi," then very much under the in
fluence of the libations which he had
obtained by false pretense within a
stonethrow of the Hall of Justice.
Judge Conlan gave him six months â
the maximum penalty for vagrancy.

quitted Thomas G. Morris, a barber,
who was accused of having illegally
practiced the art of healing by giving
Detective Mathewson electrical treat
ments for an alleged ailment. An ad
ditional shock was conveyed to the de
tective by the announcement of the
verdict.
Frank J. Cuneo and Nellie, his wife,
denied that they willfully stole the
purse of Miss Adeline Birchler, a pro
fessional vocalist, while she was tem
porarily absent from the apartment of
an Ocean Beach cafe, In which she had
been partaking of a tete-a-tete Bupper
with F. D. Ogden, a Southern Pacific
claims adjuster. The policeman who
was notified of Miss Birchler*s loss
overhauled the Cuneos In another cafe
near the beach and the man at once
produced the money, $62. His object
In picking ud the wallpt, he Bald, was
to hold It In safe keeping for its own
er, whom he was seeking when the po
liceman met him. The cash was re
stored to Miss Birchler, who declined
to file formal complaint, and Judge
Cabaniss perforce dismissed the two
Cuneos, Frank and Nellie.
As Miss Birchler informed the court

When the policeman responded to the
cries of alarmed neighbors of Jeremiah
and Mary Hurley he found that ill
mated couple in the small yard back
of their abode, 34 Natoma street, and
on all sides were evidences of recent
fierce conflict. Amid a heap of shat
tered boxes Fat Jeremiah, ruefully rub
bing his cranium, while over him stood
Mary, with a heavy club In position to
swing. She was tauntingly challeng
ing her recumbent spouse to rise and
accept some more of the discipline to
which she had apparently been sub
jecting him when he went down to
avoid punishment, and he was unques
tionably unwilling to take up the deft.
The policeman, Goff by name, once
upon a time held a pugilistic champion
ship, and his winning of it necessitated
but little more physical exertion than
he was compelled to Invest In the dis
arming and subjugation of Mary. With
commendable prudence Mr. Hurley re
tained his seat until the policeman was
assured of victory. Then the belliger
ents were conveyed to prison and
charged with peace disturbance.
Jeremiah appeared when the case
was called before Judge Conlan, but
Mary, who had been admitted to bail,
sent word to the court that her
strength had been overtaxed by the
double event of defeating her husband
and resisting the officer. So the trial
of Jeremiah was proceeded with. Af
ter several ladies, neighbors of the
Hurleys, had testified that their days
and nights were made hideous by the
interminable wrangling of the de
fendants. Miss Mary "Wofforth ascend
ed the witness-stand and informed
the Judge that, In her opinion, Mr.
Hurley was no less deserving; of pun
ishment than his absent wife.
"Why?" Inquired the bench.
â¢"Cause," replied Miss Wofforth, "I
seed him soak de cop."
His Honor seemed mystified,
and the young lady blushlngly has
tened to explain that by laying "cop"
she meant to say policeman.
"Oh, 'cop' is intelligible," said the
Judge; "it's 'soak' that puzzles."
After "slugr" s-nd "lam" had been re
jected Miss Wofforth happily thought
of "strike" as a synonym for "soak,"
and the court stood enlightened.
Mr. HuTley was found guilty of
peace disturbance and will be sen
tenced as soon as Mrs. Hurley's case
has been disposed of.

ERROR DELAYS
STREET WORK
Paving of Mission Road Is
Blocked, as Wrong Ordi
nance Was Sent to Major
WANTS HOUSE VACATED
Grand Jury Says Walls of
620 Jackson Street Are
Xot of Legal Thickness
Owing to a technical error In the
proceedings of the Board of Supervis
ors authorizing the paving with as
phalt of Mission street between Onon
daga and Porter avenues at a cost of
$80,000, the Board of Public Works was j
compelled yesterday to delay the per- i
formance of the work until the error i
can be rectified. The Barber Asphalt
Company, in response to Invitations for |
proposals, was prepared to file a bid j
to do the work, but when its repre- i
sentative was apprised of the nature |
of the error he decided to withdraw j
the bid, for the added reason that no \
provision was made for the building
of a sewer In the street.
President Maestretti said that the
first ordinance passed by the board au- j
thorizing the work contained a clause
specifying that a contract was to be
entered into for the paving of the
Ftreet except on that portion required
to be kept in repair by the railroad
company. This was a mistake, as
there are no tracks laid on the portion
of the thoroughfare proposed to be im
proved. A new ordinance was passed j
which specified that the contract was
to cover the paving of the street with
the exception of a strip twenty feet j
wide in the central part, reserved as a
rlgrht of way for the company which
has a franchise therefor. This ordi
nance was duly passed, but the first '
ordinance by some oversight was sent
to the Mayor, who affixed his signa
ture thereto. Now the proceedings '
must be begun over again so the work ;
can be legally performed.
The City Streef Improvement Com
pany was awarded the contract for the
repair of bituminous pavements in the
district bounded by Post, Lombard and
Devisadero streets and Van Ness ay- ;
enue; Eighth street from Mission to
Folsom; Folsom street from Ninth to
Twentieth: Thirteenth street from Fol
â Otn to Harrison; Guerrero street from
Market to Twentieth; Shotwell street,
from Fourteenth to Twentieth; Market
street from Van Ness avenile to Cas
tro.
The City Engineer was directed to '
prepare an estimate of cost of building
i a sewer in H street from Seventh to
l Twentieth avenues.
G. H. Roundey wanted to know what
had been done regarding the removal
1 of alleged obstructions on Thirty-sixth
' avenue and X street. Commissioner
Eagan stated that after a personal in-
I spection he had failed to find any ob- ;
; structions.
The board received t, communication
from the Grand Jury calling attention
to the alleged fact that the walls of
the building at 620 Jackson street do
not comply with the building ordi
nance in that they are only nineteen
inches In thickness Instead of twenty-,
one inches. The Grand Jury desired
the board to do police duty and clear
the structure of the inmates. The City
Architect was directed to detail an in
spector to accompany the members of .
the board in an investigation of the
actual conditions. "When the Commis
sioners arrived at the place they were
served with an injunction by Attorney
Mack and prevented from entering the ;
building.

Pancratius, and his brave and stalwart
friend, Sebastian, during; the bloody
persecutions In the reigrn of the Em

cuing friendless children from the
deadfalls of the city and making them
useful and respectable men and

11 Before I wrote to you, telling you how 1
felt, I had doctored for over two years steady
and spent lots of money on medicines besides,
but it all failed to help me. My monthly pe-
riods had ceased and I suffered much pain,
with fainting spells, headache, backache and
bearing-down pains, and I was so weak I
could hardly keep around. As a last resort
I decided to write you and try Lydia E. Pink-

thankful that I did, for after following your
instructions, which you sent me free of all
charge, my monthly periods started ; I am
regular and in perfect health. Had it not
been for you I would be in my grave to-day.
" I sincerely trust that this letter may lead
every suffering woman in the country to

Bernardino in Wagon Which
Was Her Hpme.
SAN BERNARDINO, March 2.â
Mrs. Eliza Escovera, a Mexican
woman, diea last evening at the age
of 106 years. She was born in Mex
ico in 1800. In 1810 she witnessed
iho assembling of the patriots under
Don Miguel Hidaigo at Guanajuanato
and thirteen years later joined in the
popular welcome to General Iturbide,
when Mexico's independence was for
mally recognized by Spain. Her death
occurred in an old wagon in which
she and her son, now 83 years old,
traveled from Mexico to this place.
TbÂ«7 had lived in the wagon for about
fifteen years.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 3, 1905.
ST. FRANCIS, A SON OF RUBICON,
BEATS ACHELITA A SCANT NOSE
Big Beach, the Heavily Supported Mount of Bonner,
Cleverly Defeated by Downpatrick.
Talent Select the
Winners and the
Ring Loses.
When five first choices take the mai:
for the count, the general supposition
is the bookmakers that night rent it
larger box in the safe deposit vaults
But not so at Oakland yesterday.
Although Ruby, from the stable ot
Walter Jennings, was the one success
ful favorite, the winning horses were
all so well backed that the major por
tion of the layers added nothing to
their bank rolls. Flaunt closed at 10,
while St. Francis, Mogregor, Best Man
and Bownpatrick were all second
choices in the ring.
Achelita, the Napa Stock Farm en
try and a 13 to 5 favorite, was nosed
out for the 2-year-old scramble by St.
Francis, a strapping son of Rubicon.
The latter had shown well in morning
trials and was well played at 4 and 5
to 1. Bonner rode the favorite and got
his mount away in the lead. The fast
clip told on the filly and under Mc-
Eride's vigorous urging, St. Francis
Just nailed her at the wire. Chief
Wittman ran a good third.
RUBY WINS IN CLOSE FINISH.
In an exceedingly industrious finish,
a neck and a nose separating the three
leaders, Ruby took the purse for maid
en 3 and 4 year-olds from Celeres and
Phalanx. The Jennings filly closed a
9 to 20 choice, but did not win like the
airtight certainty she was supposed to
be. Phalanx made all the running and
was only nabbed the last few yards.
"Big Bill" Knapp, without a bat, pil
oted the winner.
Golden Buck, a 13 to 6 chance from
the Schorr stable, made a poor favorite
for the futurity course selling number.
Mogregor received steady and scientific
support, and defeated Grenore with
apparent ease. A. Lady, which cut out
the running, led the first choice out for
show honors. Edrodun is of no use on
a fast track.
Tom Ryan's Flaunt was brought
from an outlying district by Birken
ruth and downed Montana Peeress a
neck for the mile and seventy yards
selling fixture. The aged gelding went
to the post a 10 to 1 shot and, standing
a long drive, won by a neck. Bonner,
astride the 2 to 1 favorite .Budd Wade,
infused plenty of ginger into his work,
but was unable to do better than finish
third. Profitable ran fourth after
making all the pace.
SON OF TENNY IS BEATEN.
Toupee has moved into the hard luck
zone. The little Tenny gelding with
Larsen on his back had first call in the
betting in the six-furlong selling event
and, without a mishap, couldn't land.
Out in front and looking all over a
winner, Travers got up with Best Man
and beat him a length. Jimmy Coffey's
Ocyrohe snatched the show from Hul
ford by a head.
Charley McCafferty's Big Beach fell
short one position in the final mile and
fifty yard purse run for three-year
olds. He closed favorite and led for
more than seven-eighths of the route.
Then Birkenruth cut loose with Down
patrick. winning cleverly by about a
length. Fisher Boy dropped from the
clouds, finishing third.
TRACK NOTES.
Birkenruth piloted two winners.
Ed Lanigan, the well known poli
tician, was much pleased over the
victory of St. Francis, as he Is the
owner of Rubicon. Chief Wittman,
also a son of Jtubison. finished third
in the same race. In defeating Ache
lita the coast record for three and a
half furlongs of :41Vfc was equaled by
St. Francis.
Mogregor was bid up from $400 to
$500 by James Neil and C. C. Mc-
Cafferty let the three-year-old go.
An employe of Charley McCafferty
later on bid up Best Man from $400
to $700, but Dr. Rowell retained the
sprinter.
The probable starters for the Wa
terhouse cup over two and a quarter
miles to-morrow are Schoolmate
(114), Horatius (111), Veterano
(110), Barrack (106), Flying Tor
pedo (106), Rio Shannon (105) and
Colonel Anderson (105).
Bonner, who piloted Achelita, was
fined $50 for rough riding.
James McElroy, a director of the
Kings County Fair Association of Se
attle, was a visitor at Oakland yester
day.
Jim Neil purchased Ethel Abbott
from M. D. Miller yesterday for $900.
Harry Stover traded off his two
year-old George A- Knight to "Kan
sas" Price for Edlnborough â and
some boot.

mixed doubles tennis tournament,

dies' Annex and by the Golden Gate

RICOH GOLD STRIKES
NEAR MOUNT McKINXEY
New Discoveries Cause a Stampede
of Miners From the Fair
banks Region.
> TACOMA, March 2. â Reports of
gold strikes in paying quantities in the
neighborhood of Mount McKinley are
causing a stampede of > miners - from
Fairbanks. The new fields are said to
be reached by good trails. ;â¢ Accounts
of the new diggings were brought here
to-day by miners returning from
Valdez. V
v "There are no extraordinary big
nuggets .or ' heavy, pans," said one
miner, "yet claims which give promise
of much richness are â  being worked.
All the creeks prospected in the Mount
McKinley neighborhood are tributaries
of / the ; Kantshna *; River and on the
east side of that stream. - I passed a
large number of prospecting parties oh
their way to the â¢ district j and believe
the rush will be heavy before the sea
son Is over. All \ the i available claims
must be staked by this time."

FIGHTING MEN
TAKE AFFRIGHT
Powerful Lobby Descends
Upon Sacramento to Pre
vent Adverse Legislation
BOXING BILL MAY PASS
Proponents of the Measure
Claim They Have the Re
quired Number of Votes
Special Dispatch to Th* CalL
SACRAMENTO, March 2.â The prize
fight lobby came to town to-night In
force, but filled with fear and trem
bling lest the bill that will stop the
game be passed by the Assembly.
There was in the party nearly a score
of men who are more or less well
known In the San Francisco sporting
world. Their spirits were dampened
when they reached here by news that
the bill would be passed by the As
sembly unless a great change cajne
over the face of affairs. Its propon
ents claim there are at present 46
votes pledged for It and 41 will send
It to the Governor.
The delegation of sporting men was
led by Harry Corbett and Eddie
Graney. There were also In the party
James E. Britt, the elder; Theodore
Lunstedt, Jack yTelch, Morris Levy,
Billy Gallagher, Jack Wolf, Kid Lewis,
Charles Mitchell, Billy Nolan and sev
eral others whose names are sometimes
heard in the realm of sport.
Led by Harry Laurenzen and Colonel
Martin Brady, who has been doing
what he could against the measure for
some days, the delegation descended
on the Assembly and in the anteroom
made things buzz for nearly two hours.
Every one of the sports who had a
friend upon the floor sent. for him and
the liveliest scene witnessed in the out
er chamber this wesslon was the result.
The lobby from the bay was fearful
that the measure would be taken up
for final passage to-night, but Assem
blyman Amerlge, who is the author of
the duplicate to Ralston's measure in
the lower House, said he would not
take It up until to-morrow or Satur
day, more likely the latter day. It is
on third reading and ready for final
passage.
MAY BE IjAST BOXING SHOW.
Berger and Long Will Meet To- Night
In Woodward's Pavilion.
Joe Long was seen at his Larkspur
training quarters yesterday,, and his
healthy appearance proved beyond all
question of a doubt the reports of his
conscientious work while preparing
for his match with Sam Berger at
"Smiling" Metzner's. Joe has sud
denly acquired a disposition to work
all the time, and his trainers had
their hands full making him under
stand it is poor policy to do any stren
uous labor on the day preceding the
fight. Long said: "This being in
condition is an altogether new expe
rience to me. When a fighter gets
into the shape I'm in at present it's
much harder to sit still and do nothing
than to go out on the road and grind
off eight or ten miles. I feel as
though I could go twenty rounds Just
as easily as four, but I figure on beat
ing Berger before that time."
Berger's work for the day consisted
of nothing more than a stroll through
the park and a plunge in the ocean.
As. a matter of fact Sam haa been in
good condition since the Casey fight, j
and is fearful lest he become stale.
His trainers, however, have exercised i
splendid judgment and have suc
ceeded in keeping the big fellow on
edge without working him too hard.
There Is a possibility that the show
offered by the Bay City Athletic Club
at Woodward's to-night may bÂ«^ the
last entertainment in the boxing line j
to be witnessed in this State. The
boys who are to furnish the sport all j
realize this fact and intend endeavor
ing to make this show a memorable
one.

OLDEST CHILD
TELLS SECRETS
Mrs. Levy's Testimony a
Series of Sensational
LVvelations of Trouble
BBEAKS SISTER'S NOBI
Herbert Yoell Is Alleged
to Have Disfigured the
Countenance of Mrs. Dunn
Toell familr troubles, pome of the
deepest secrets of the dead pioneer" at
torney, dropped yesterday in startling
succession from the lips of Ycell's first
daughter, the administratrix of his es
tate and the chief beneficiary under
his contested v. ill.
The session in Judge Kerrigan's court
\va.= important for the proponent?. Mr.
Delmas had infrequent need to ques
tion his witness and Mr. Hoefier took
rare occasion to offer objections. That
Mn. Evylyn Amelia Levy was not re
luctant to tell all she knew was ex
cused by her statement that her father
had confided his affairs to her and left
her his diaries with the instruction to
use them "'as the voice of the dead"
If she should be called into court to
defend his last wishes.
First in the examination of Bin
Levy, came the production of family
heirlooms and an explanation of
Yoell's veneration for his father and
mother. Among the exhibits to tht
jury was a miniature painting of
Abraham Yoell, grandfather of the
witness, and a lock of the 1 grand
mother's hair. There was another
heirloom, a ring worn by the grand
father. Yoell had" given it to hie son
and taken it away from him to give to'
Mrs. Levy, with the explanation that
no one as dishonest as John Yoel! was
fit to wear the ring "of the grandest
man I ever knew."
SAVED PROM PRISON.
The matter of John Yoell's dishonesty
led to an inquiry regarding the young
man's alleged defrauding of his fa
ther's client, Marie Rogers. Mrs. Levy
told the story. Pat Hannon, on Mi.-.
Rogers' behalf, had threatened to
nroreeute the son criminally. When
the father heard of it, in his anger and
disgrace, he said the boy should be
"sent to prison, where he belonged."
and- refused to pay Hannon. Mrs.
Yoell. stepmother of the witness, said
that she would commit suicide if her
son was arrested. Yoell was obdur
ate. His anger lasted for a day and a
night, when Mrs. Yoeli asked Mrs.
Levy to plead with him.
Mrs. Levy agreed on condition that
she be permitted to ask John if he had
committed any other thefts. John said
that the Rogers case was the extent
of his misdoing. She reported to the
father, -who agreed to pay the amount
on condition that Mr?. Yoell would
agree not to give John any more money
and that Mrs. Dunn, her daughter.
should receive less of his estate. Mrs.
Y--eU agreed, but her husband was
doubtful and asked Mrs. Levy to re
mrmber every word of the conversa
tion, "because you will have to testify
to it some day."
Next was introduced a letter from
father to daughter, saying that the
writer was confronted by the most ter
'.]â :â  sorrow cf his life. The witness
said the letter had its beginning in the
act of a fishmonger, who stopped
Yoell on the steps of the church and
demanded payment of his wife's fish
bill. Yoell investigated and found the
bill owing, notwithstanding that after
the separation he was paying his wife
?500 a month. The father told his
daughter that he had been informed
that Mrs. Yoell was gambling with her
income and had not paid her house
hold expenses. Bills came in from
many tradespeople and coachman,
gardener, maid and cook. were behind
on their wages. When Yoell had set
tled all his wife's accounts, as shown
by the receipts in evidence, he had
paid out more than $11,000 to "keep
the finger of scorn from being pointed
at him as a man who did not pay his
bills."
STOLEN DEEDS.
Mrs. Levy told in detail of the "suit
over the deeds," which was decided in
Yoell's favor. This involved the charge
that his wife had stolen undelivered
deeds from his desk and had "hawked
them on tlte streets of San Jose in an
effort to get money." Mrs. Levy said,
too, that Mrs. Yoell brought her first
suit for divorce "because she was des
perate for money and that was the
only way she could get it."
There was another suit in San Jose
wherein the creditors of Mrs. Y'oell
opposed her discharge from bank
ruptcy. Genevieve Yoell Parkhurst
had then testified that her father had
advised her mother to go Into bank
ruptcy. Mrs. Levy says that when he
heard this Yoell ejaculated, "rank per
jury." When Mrs. Yoell testified, Yoell
had risen from his seat, exclaiming.
"May God have mercy on your soul! I
wish I could testify." John Yoell, said

WANTS PLANS

Committee of Architects Ob
tain Consent of Board of
Education to Competition
KKiHT TEACHERS NAMED
Vice Principals Appointed
and Classes Restored in
the Lick and Xoe Schools
A committee of the Pan Francisco
Chapter vl the American Institute of
Architects, consisting of WHlia-m Mo
ser, A. Schultz, S. Schnaittacher. K.
Kollafrath, Clarence Ward and Mat
thew O'Brien, addressed the Beard of
Education yesterday in support of the
petition of the chapter that a public
competition be held for the getting of
plans for the buildinc? to be erected
under the b</nd issue. Moser said that
the I'nited States Government found it
much cheaper and more satisfactory to
have a public competition, aa a savin?
of 3^3 per cent was effected and the
architecture of the buildings is more
diversified. â¢ .
The Board of Education expressed
itself Jr. favor of competition f--/r the
school building p^ans and the commit
tee declared its intention to wait on
the Board of Works, the Board of
Supervisors and the Mayor in behalf
of its petition. Under, the charter th-
Beard of Works prepares the plans
and the Board, of Education approves
th>=m if satisfactory.
The board adopted the recommenda- ,â¢
tlon of Superintendent Langdon that L
the action taken January 13 transfer- !
ring the primary classes of the James
Lick to the Not Valley school and the !
grammar classes of the Noe Valley to [.
the James Lick be rescinded, thereby
restoring the conditions that obtained
in the schools named prior to January
13. * â¢
The Richmond and Bernal primary
schools were designated as grammar P
schoc-ls on account of increased attend- j
ance in the grammar grades effecting i
an increase of $30 monthly in the sal- !
aries of Principals Regan and Keat- â

"It's a mighty good thing for you. that ;
I can't, you thief," the old man re-.'
torted; "I'd land you in State's pris
on." Sft^w
Then came evidence about Yoell's
opinion that his son John was the evil
genius of the family and this was fol
lowed by inquiry into â  Mrs. Lev>*'s
knowledge of the will made in , her
favor. She denied the testimony of
her half-sister Gertrude on this point"
and said her father told her that John
Kay. his valet, had been told by John
Yoell that "he (Kay) would be a gold
mine to him John Yoell) In the fu
ture" by helping to break any unsatis
factory will his father might make."
BROKE her NOSE.
The domestic relations of Herbert
Yoell and his wife Dottle, who had
just sued him for maintenance, were
the next subject of inquiry- Mrs. Levy
said Herbert had demanded $500 from j
his father and. shaking his fist in the
paternal * face, , had declared if the !
money was not forthcoming he '"could
disgrace him more than Johnny had."
On another occasion Herbert, accusing
his sister. Mrs. Dunn, of saying that
his wife as not good enough to as
sociate with, had "with one blow,
broken his sister's nose. " It was re
lated that ; the ' "poor girl suffered ter
ribly." and the surgeon who set the
member made such a bad job of it that
â  the nose had to be rebroken and set
again.
Upon cross-examination Mr. Hoefler
went into the secrets of Yoell's first
marriage. He asked Mr*. Levy if her
own mother was present on an occa
sion of Mrs. Levy's illness. .
"That's a strange question to ask
me." she replied. J
"Nothing is " sacred here," retorted
Mr. < Hoefler, while Mr. Delmas was of
fering his objections.
"Well, then, she was not present. She
1 had no right to be. I had not seen her ;
for years, because Mrs. Yoell forbade
me seeing. her." aBEâ¢

CONTEST TO-DAY
Colorado Assembly Adjourns :
Out of Respect to Memory
of Late Edward 0. Wolcott
. Â«Â« â â !
FOO BEPOKTS FILED
By 3lajority of One Republi
cans on the Committee
Favor Ousting of Adams
DENVER, Colo., March 2.âConsider
ation of the reports of the committee
which heard the evidence in James H.
Peabody's contest for the office of
Governor was postponed to-day by the
Joint convention of the General Assem
bly in consequence of the death of Ed
ward O. Wolcott, former United States
Senator from Colorado. The General
Assembly appointed a committee to
draft resolutions in memory of the
late Senator and adjourned until 10
o'clock to-morrow forenoon.
Four reports were filed with Lieuten
ant Governor Jesse A. McDonald toy
the Gubernatorial Contest Committee
to be presented to the joint conven
tion of the General Assembly, which
will decide, after hearing arguments,
whether or not Governor Alva Adams
shall surrender his office to former
Governor James H. Peabody, who con
tested the election.
Fourteen Republican members of the
committee, a majority of one, finally
signed the report in favor of ousting
Adams and seating Peabody, which
was prepared by counsel for Peabody,
but six of these committeemen de
clared they reserved the right to vote
as they saw fit after hearing the argu
ments in Joint convention. They said
they signed the report merely to get
the matter before the Assembly.
The nine Democratic members made
a report recommending the dismissal
of the Peabody contest, because no
case had been made by the evidence.
The minority Republican report rec
ommends that the contest filed by
Peabody be dismissed, as he did not
receive a plurality of the legal votes for
Governor.

decline -at â  Liverpool . being partly responsible !
for the bearish sentiment. â Liberal receipts in |
the Northwest formed an additional factor at
the/ opening. Later the â â¢-; demand improved ,
somewhat. - The moderate decline brought out i
covering by shorts and purchasing by commis- i
sion houses. The . market ' soon â  rallied â  from |
the Initial weakness. May advancing to $1 15%. I
July sold up to OS 14 c. : Som* reaction followed i

AH kinds of seed Potatoes and fancy table
Burbanks were in limited supply and tirm at
steady prices, with trade moderately active,
but low-grade offerings, particularly those from
the river districts, were hard to move, although
offered at easy rates. â¢â â¢ There was practically
no market for Sweet Potatoes. There were
no new arrivals, and old and deteriorating
stock was Belling down to 10c per sack, while
a few small lots of picked-over stock brought
75c per cack. Onions were firm at the flat
rate of $3 per cental and there was very little
stock left in first hands. Jobbers were ex
acting a premium of 25c per cental for their
holdings and it was generally expected that the
market would advance as soon as the two
carloads that are now overdue from Oregon
come to hand. Five sacks of new Potatoes
came In from Niks and sold at 3Hc per pound.
Receipts of Asparagus were lighter than en
the preceding day and the market was slightly
firmer, with extra stock selling at 12^c per
pound and the lower grades at s#loc, accord
ing to quality. There was a decline in Rhu
barb, caused by competition between the com
bination of dealers who are handling the as
sociation's shipments and independent receiv
ers. The association established a flat rate of
$2 per box. f. o. h.. San Lorenzo, while the
outside stock is shipped on consignment, and
the result is that the association* agents are
obliged to sell at or below cost in order to
compete with the independents. Southern
vegetables were scarce and generally firm. A
car of Rhubarb started East from San Lo
renzo. '=-:-v -

Butter. Cheese and Kggft-
I There were several pronounced features to
; the markets under this head yesterday. One
! was a . further advance in Butter. It was
partly legitimate and partly fictitious. It was
I legitimate as far as it mm due to the C m
\ paratlvely bare condition of the market and
the law of supply and demand: and.it was
fictitious as far as it wag due to the irritated
action of some houses, who, not heretofore in
favor of advancing quotations at all. are now
proceeding upon the theory that a3 long as the
market lias pone up the .best way to get it
back is to unnaturally boom it to the point of
Inflation, when it will drop of Its own accord.
| "The higher it goes the sooner and lower it
will fall." they say. so they are pushing it
jup as rapidly as possible. The' northern or
! ders continue, but it is a question whether
they will stand much mops, of an advance.
Another feature was the large and active
demand for store Eggs ' both here and in the
country, The bakers are taking in large lines
for storage in lime, and under this demand
this description is firm. .Ranch, on the con
trary, are quiet and in excessive supply,
' though they. too. are moving off better ?ince
prices went down to a point where the re
! tailer can sell them to the public at 20c. At
! this figure Eggs are a cheap and economical
: article of food and the consumption has visibly
increased at it. â¢ . -
The third feature was a further advance in
Cheese, which Is well cleaned up and in brisk
1 demand. Most houses have comparatively bare
i shelves.
Receipts were 68,800 lbs Butter, 1103 cases
! Eggs and 10,lC0 lbs Cheese.

I . The Orange market ruled firm under con
tinued light receipts and a steady demand and
stocks of all grades Were steadily decreasing.
The small sizes of Navels, that is, 150 a, 17ns
: and 21fts had the most call and â¢ were rela
| tively : firmer than the larger : sizes. â â¢ The
steamer Al&meda. out to-morrow for Honolulu,
will take at least 1000 boxes, : most, of which
i were purchased at the recent auction . sales.

in a manner M vivid and lucid as to
win the rapt attention of the learned

'â  Another rai^. speaker who journeyed
to be handsome seminary overlooking
"one" of -the most picturesque spots in
â¢Npfthern California ' was â  Dr. K. A.
. Walton, the eminent evangelist now en
gaging the attention of Oakland, .who
stayed long enough to give, the younger
students of theology advice drawn- "from
his years of pulpit experience.'
tf peaking of The Use and Abuse of
Benevolences." the Rev. Mr. Eldridge
shoM-t-d that he had given the subject.
of promiscuous alms-giving careful
study. He praised the Associated
<"ha.ritjes for its systematic Work . in
dispensing relief to the worthy. Pro
miscuous givmg. In his opinion, made
perpetual beggars, and the Associated
f'harities was the corrective. He be
lieved that out of 1000 beggars who re
1 spontaneous assistance on the
asking not one per cent were worthy
cases. He related instances of impu
dent fraud which were only encouraged
by- indiscriminate giving.
President John S. Macintosh declared
the old system of indiscriminate piving
a.- tremendous mistake. The Christian
church, he added, must organize its
charity and see that God's poor had not
k civic charity or the charity of
th*> work. Tlje hardest cases to reach
werf r. There were starving
gentlewomen in all cities and starving
gentlemen. The women, said President
Macintosh, slipped behind the screen,
but the men sometimes bumped against
those wh<-> found out trreir plight.
Mr BMiidce felt thai the Christian
< hur<hep >ught to care for all their
poor, and declared that he would never
take one nickel from the Associated
< 'harities for his own people.
Ng Poor Chew stirred his hearers by
tiis statement that a great part of
china was ready to receive Christian
'lraphically he told of the Boxer
uprising and other massacres where
Christian Chinese had given up their
for Christianity and died as truly
martyrs as had the carry Christians.
na's Government had cent more
than 200 eof her young men to America
and Europe to study Western accom
plishments and receive a modern edu
cation. He denied that China was the
same to-day as yearfe ago. Heretofore
China had gloried in the impression
ttiat she possessed all the knowledge,
but n<nv *h<- felt differently. Both the
Chinese Government and the Chinese
people, th^ speaker said, had great
faith in the Christian missionary.
The conference adjourned sine die.
Before departing the whole assemblage
congratulated President Macintosh and
the fatuity cm the great success of, the
deliberations.

LEAVES BOARD
Governor' Pardee Is Asked
to Appoint Charles Sonntag
a State Prison Director
XAPA INSANE ASYLUM
Influences For and Against
Retention of Dr. Hennessey
on the Board of Managers
Word comes from Sacramento that
the S.in Francisco delegation in the
Legislature has indorsed Colonel
Charles Sonntag for the position of
S;ate Prison director. The term of
R. ML Fitzgerald expired in January,
1904. but the Governor has not ap
pointed his successor. The story goes
that Directors Felton. Wilkins, Devlin
and Ray -are so deeply impressed with
Mr. Fitzgeraid'B ability and experi
ence in the direction of prison man
agement that they have advised against
his retirement from the board. More
over, it is hinted that at least two of
the directors ;tre not In sympathy with
Colonel Sonntag's ambition to be ap
pointed to the board. In order to pre
serve harmony in the prison directo
rate the Governor may be guided by
the judgment of a majority of the
board. It is common gossip in pol
itical circles, however, that Colonel
Sonntag, shortly after the guberna
torial election in 1902, received some
kind of assurance that he would be
recognized when the time came for
filling the first vacancy on the board
of directors. It if also reported that
he has not improved his chances of
success by procuring indorsements for
the position. It is said that the exec
utive asks this question: Why is
there so much importunity for ap
pointment when there is no salary at
tached to the position?"
In Napa County there is a strong
factional fight against the reappoint
ment of Dr. E. Z. Hennessey to the
board of managers of the Napa State
Hospital. Dr. Hennessey's term ex
pired last July. Next June there will
be two more expirations. Hence it is
reported that the Governor will wait
4.nd make the three appointments at
the same time. While Dr. Hennessey
has a bunch of political enemies in
Xapa County he has also a strong fol
lowing of political friends. The Gov
ernor is giving representatives of each
faction a hearing. The politicians in
the valley assert that he is not giving
out the slightest hints In regard to
Dr. Hennessey. The latter, however,
i? said to be confident that his politi
cal adversaries cannot get his scalp.
Efforts to induce the Republican
State Central Committee to participate
in the controversy in behalf of either
faction have not been successful.
SUE FOR THE INSURANCE
ON CONTRABAND OF WAR
Getz Brothers Want Payment for
Beef Cargo Which Was Seized
Before Reaching Port Arthur.
A second suit for the recovery of
insurance on contraband of war
shipped to Russian ports in war time
was begun yesterday by Getz Brothers
against the St. Paul Fire and Marine
Insurance Company. The former suit
was based upon beef shipments to
Vladivostok, which were protested
against by the insurance company
after the steamer China sailed.
Yesterday's action grows out of a
shipment of 12.240 barrels of beef on
the steamer Korea in February of
last year, billed for Port Arthur. The
Korea reached Nagasaki on March 2
last, and on March 19 the cargo was
seized and condemned by the Gover
nor of Nagasaki as contraband of
war. The plaintiffs demand the pay
ment of $15,900 on the policy, which
insured against seizure in war.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 3, 1905.
SAYS HIS WIFE
IS A DRUNKARD
President of Oil Company
Makes Ugly Charges in
Complaint for Divorce
BUYS WINE ON CREDIT
Document Gives Instances
of Her Weakness, Dating
Back to Their Marriage
Thirteen typewritten pages are used
by W. E. Holbrook, president of the
American Oil and Refining Company,
to give a chronqlogical history of his
wife's alleged intemperance, upon the
ground of which he sues for divorce.
They were married at San Rafael on
February 5, 15 96, and his first charge
is that in June of that year, when he
returned from a business trip to New
York, he found her at the home of her
mother, 123 Steiner street, under the
influence of liquor and hardly able to
speak or walk.
He also found himself obliged, he
scys, to pay an unauthorized wine bill
of $1950. There are allegations of
"gross intoxication" and "drunk and
maudlin" behavior, which later at
tracted the "neighbors on both sides of
the street." His complaints are said
to have been met with vile epithets
and orders to pack his grip and go,
and when he refused to provide more
money with which to buy drinkables,
he was, he says, subjected to abuse
and a threat that she "would get some
fellow who had the money." During
their life at the St. Nicholas there was
a bill for extras, "chiefly whisky,"
amounting to $182 in a month. Wine
bills were sent to him from all quar
ters.
The divorce case of Emily W. Dixon
against G. A. Dixon, in which the hus
band's default had been entered, was
called before Judge Graham yesterday,
but the court decided to try its hand
again at reconciliation and postponed
the trial until next Wednesday. It
appears that the parties have been
married for twenty-two years and the
husband struck his wife in a quarrel
over the presence of his mother-in
law in the home.
Other divorces were granted as fol
lows: By Judge Seawell to Mary Coret
from Emil Coret, a special policeman,
for cruelty; to Nellie Taisen from John
C. Taisen, cruelty; by Judge Kerrigan
to Margaret H. Trimble from Edward
A. Trimble, desertion; by Judge Gra
ham to Sarah E. Matthews from
James E. Matthews, cruelty; to Jo
seph F. Miller to Lottie Miller, deser
tion.
Suits for divorce were filed by Al
bert Taylor against Maggie Taylor, de
sertion; by Katherine Hathaway
against James E. Hathaway, intemper
ance; by Thomas Woodward against
Frances Woodward, desertion; by
Ruby M. Carberry against David J.
Carberry, desertion and cruelty; Wal
ter H. Crelghton against Margaret P.
Creighton, desertion.
ERROR IX INFORMATIONS
LEADS TO COMPLICATIONS
Attorney Takes Advantage of a Print-
er's Mistake to Ask for Dismis
sal of His Client.
It developed yesterday during an
argument on a motion to dismiss the
information charging Peter Willems
with an assault with a deadly weapon
before Judge Cook that all the infor
mations for about a month back con
tain a fatal printer's error. In the
words "contrary to the form, force
and effect of the statute" a "t" had
been left out In "statute," making it
"Gtatue," and a dismissal was asked.
The Judge denied the motion,
whereupon Attorney Hoff Cook for
the defendant promptly interposed a
demurrer to the information and after
argument the Judge reserved his de
cision till next Monday,
District Attorney Byington said that
if the demurrer was sustained it would
simply put him to the trouble of fil
ing a new information. No advantage
of the error could be taken after a de
fendant pleaded. New blanks had
now been provided by Brown & Pow
er, the printers, and only a few infor
mations had been filed containing the
error.
HARBOR COMMISSIONERS
TALK ON BELT RAILROAD
Members of the. Board Diecnss Vari-
ous Plans, but Take No Definite
Action.
The Board of Harbor Commission
ers held its regular weekly session
yesterday afternoon. The meeting was
brief and was taken up mostly in dis
cussing the extension of the belt rail
road. The members of the board con
sidered the project of extending the
line farther along East street. Many
of the business men in the vicinity of
Market and Mission streets object to
this change. The board took no ac
tion. The board audited many de
mands. The last week was rather a
lively one on the front and conse
quently the financial business of the
board was heavy.
Selby Case on Trial.
The trial of Isaac Selby, charged
with assault to murder for shooting
at Judge J. C. B. Hebbard on Novem
ber 28, was begun in Judge Lawlor's
court yesterday. Judge Hebbard and
other eye-witnesses testified to the
shooting and the Judge's chair was
introduced as an exhibit. A number
of witnesses were called for the Se
fense, including Judge Sloss, Police
Judge Fritz and Attorney Boardman,
who testified as to the defendant's pe
culiar actions and religious beliefs.
The case will go to the jury this af
ternoon. Several times the defendant
attempted to question the witnesses,
but he was forced to keep silent. It
was intended to delay the trial till
depositions were received from Aus
tralia as to the defendant's mental
condition, but as Judge Sloss is to
leave soon it was decided not to wait
for them.
GOUCHER PANEL EXHAUSTED.- Only
two more jurors were accepted yesterday to
try the case of Allen Goucher, charged with
the murder of Policeman Eugene C. Robinson,
when the panel was exhausted. They were
Jeremiah O'Leary and Thomas Brady. Other
four have yet to be accepted. A new venire
Â«m issued returnable this morning.
BROTHER TO GET
HUTTON'S JOB
Herbert Schmitz Induces a
Surety Company to Bind
Acts in Police Commission
SUKE OF APPOINTMENT
No Formal Announcement Is
Made Other Than Naming
of Two Surest Candidates
The fact that Herbert Schmitz yes
terday got a bond from a local surety
company in the sum of 55000 to bind
him in his acts as a Police Commis
sioner leaves no doubt that the Mayor's
brother will be appointed to the post
within a day or two. The appoint
ment may be delayed until the fate of
suspended Chief of Police Wittman has
been disposed of by Commissioners
Reagan, Poheim and Drinkhouse.
Schmitz's appointment as Police
Commissioner will preclude the carry
ing out of the original programme to
have Secretary De Succa of the Park
Commission make room for Schmitz
by being transferred to the store
keepership of the Board of Education.
De Succa will therefore stay where he
is. John G. Fitzgerald stands a fine
chance for the storekeepership.
The appointment of a Police Com
missioner has been held in abeyance
because Herbert Schmita was unde
cided as to whether he desired the
place or that of secretary of the Park
Commission. His friends have been
importuning him to take the Commis
sionership, and that he has finally con
sented x the securing of his official bond
for the place would indicate. The
Mayor has made no official announce
ment of the appointment, contenting
himself with saying that his brother
and Alexander O'Grady were the two
candidates who were most seriously
considered for the appointment.
Town Talk.
The Saunterer tells why the Walter
Martins posponed their European trip;
also, of the registration of prominent
citizens in French restaurants; of an epi
sode of a rehearsal for the society vau
deville that engendered friction be
tween two matrons. The Saunterer
has discovered a famous poet who
won't be lionized. He publishes an
excerpt from a letter from Ambrose
Bierce concerning a local novelist; also a
rebuke to Gertrude Atherton on the score
of her Anglomania. He also gives more
of the details of that offensive Phelan
cartoon. This week's open letter is ad
dressed to John D. Rockefeller and it Is
deliclously satirical. The paper also
contains complete details of the plans for
the Conried opera season, and among the
illustrations is a full-page half-tone
group of the English opera company.
The paper abounds in news of absorbing
interest and in critical comment.
Will Make Debut aa Dancer.
A feature of much interest will at
tract many toward the Alhambra to
night, where an entertainment in aid
of Sacred Heart College will take
place. Miss Manellta Winchell will
make her debut as a Spanish dancer,
her talents in this line carrying her
from the circle of society to the pro
fessional boards. Having often ap
peared at private affairs, Miss Winch
ell finally came to the notice of John
Morrisey, the Orpheum manager, and
through his advice the young dancer
has accepted an engagement with a
big New York vaudeville house and
will soon leave for her new work.
Beautiful costumes are used In the
dances by this artist, adding greatly
to her natural beauty. She comes
from a Spanish family and has much
grace and piquancy.
Rapid Growth of Charming Suburb.
Burlingame is coming to the front
very rapidly. New buildings are spring
ing up on all sides. Every day, especial
ly Sundays, one may see a large number
of homeseekers and speculators looking
at land. Prices for lots are not high.
$500 will buy a fine large lot near the
station, 50x150. $100 cash, balance
monthly, are the terms asked by Lyon &
Hoag, the agents. â¢
"Boccaccio" for Benefit Night.
The San Francisco Maternity Hos
pital will be greatly benefited by to
night's production of "Boccaccio" at
the Tivoli. Society will be out in
force, all the best seats being already
taken, and several boxes will be oc
cupied. James D. Phelan, Mrs. M. H.
de Young, TJiomas Williams, Mrs.

MAKES APPEAL
TO THE MAYOR
Health Board Resents Hold-
Up of Salaries of Em
ployes by Auditor Baehr
CENSURES SUPERVISORS
Says Finance Committee
Is Imbued With Anxiety
to Do Petty Politics
The five medical members of the
Board of Health yesterday filed an ap
peal with Mayor Schmitz that he take
steps to reverse the action of Auditor
Baehr in refusing to audit the demands
of certain employes in the food and
laboratory departments by order of the
Supervisors' finance committee. The
communication says in part:
The policy of your health commission has ,
been to conscientiously carry out for the wel- '
fare of the citizens of San Francisco an in- ;
quiry Into the foods and beverages that are '
used In this city and county. To this end I
and wholly under your sanction they have ;
sought the advice of Professor Rising of the I
University of California and Professor Still- j
man of Stanford University, heads of the â¢
department of chemistry, and have received ',
their suggestions as to organization, manage
ment and selection of chemists to perform tha .
technical work that the analysis of food pro- !
ducts necessarily requires.
In the organization of the pur* food de- \
partment we have, sought only such advice
as Is unimpeachable from the standpoint of i
scientific accuracy and unbiased citizenship. I
H. D. Gibbs of Cornell University has been
placed at the head of this department. As- '
sociated with him are chemists chosen from the '<
two great universities and approved by their '
leaders. The food inspection as carried out \
prior to our establishment of this department
of our work was of the most superficial char- |
acter and we have therefore desired to bring ',
all food Inspection to the laboratories wherein
only accurate and exacting conclusions cam be
drawn.
To every fair-minded citizen it must appeal
as a direct attempt on the part of the Finance
Committee of the present Board of Super- ;
visors to wreak out an Injustice upon this
State and city and to prevent the accomplish
ment of this good work by holding up tha
Mtaliea of these well-known scientific men.
We appeal to you to know if there Is not ;
some way by which this action can be re
versed, this Injustice redressed and the Im
portant work of this department allowed to
proceed. We are most zealous and earnest in
the fulfillment of the highest purposes to !
which our office has called us and we earnest- '
ly hope that you can suggest some means by
â which this may be taken from the grasp of ,
those who are apparently imbued more with
thw desire to do small designing and artful
politics than to subserve the material and
senltary Interests of the people of San Fran
cisco. Such acts as these, based upon such
manifestly impure motives, would have seemed
almost Incredible and impossible to us had
we not from an official station witnessed and
observed their actual accomplishment. They
can spring but from only petty and narrow
impulses, the desire to discredit and prevent,
wherever possible, the food work of your ad
ministration. We regret, as professional men
serving without compensation, not only to have
our earnest work thus impeded but also to
learn the degradation to which municipal pol
itics may drive antagonistic political faction*.
"CARMEN," NOT "OTHEUjO,"
AT COLUMBIA SATURDAY
Special Matinee Bill Is Changed
Owing to Numerous Requests
for the Spanish Opera.
A special matinee of "Carmen,"
with Marlon Ivell in the title role, is
announced for Saturday at the Co
lumbia Instead of "Othello." The
change in operas was made on ac
count of the many requests made
since the immense success of the florid
Spanish opera on last Tuesday night.
On that occasion Miss Ivell was cred
ited with an Instant and startling
achievement in the role previously
made famous by the greatest artists
that have sung in this country. This
change in bill will necessitate the
singing of three performances in suc
cession by the talented contralto,
something that would no doubt be
extremely wearing on an artist with
a less luxurious and powerful voice.
The cast for the matinee will be fur
ther notable on account of the appear
ance of Gertrude Rennyson as Mi
chaela. Miss Lane Brooks having the
role of Elsa in "Lohengrin" in the
evening. Of course Mr. Roberts will
be the Don Jose and Mr. Deane and
Mr. Boyle will have their respective
roles. This will leave Mr. Goff in his
impassioned portrayal of Telramund
in "Lohengrin" for the Saturday even
ing performance, with Mr. Wegener
as the White Knight and Miss New
man as Ortrud. Mr. Emanuel will
conduct the "Carmen" matinee.
Seats are now on sale for the sec
ond week's repertory, beginning with
"Tannhauser" on Monday evening.
The great Wagnerian opera will start
promptly at 8 o'clock under Conductor
Schenck. "Tannhauser" will be re
peated Thursday night, and at the Sat
urday matinee, with "L#a Boheme,"
sung in English, onÂ» ' Tuesday and
Thursday nights. Verdi's popular
"II Trovatore," that has not been
heard here in several years, will be
the attractive bill for Wednesday and
Saturday nights.
Last Sons Recital of Blspham.
The last Bispham concert will be
given by the famous barytone in the
Alhambra on Sunday afternoon. Thia
will orobably be the last time that
San Franclso will ever see the artist
in purely musical work, aa it is Mr.
Bispham's announced Intention to
turn his talents to the dramatic stage
and he will be seen the season after
next in a musical and dramatic play,
in which he will enact the character
of Beethoven. .
Circus Parade To-Night.
Market, Kearny and Bush streets
and Grant avenue will be visited by
the Norrls & Rowe circus parade to
night. All arrangements have been
completed for the big Illuminated
street display and the spectacle will
prove an imposing one. Everything
is new and costumes, cages, tableau
floats and wagons will prove very at
tractive. At frequent intervals fire
works will be discharged and colored
lights illuminate the line of march.
The cavalcade starts from Mechanics'
Pavilion promptly at 7:30 p. m. and
will proceed down Market street,
headed by a platoon of mounted po
lice and brass bands. Following will
come the bareback riders, a display of
blooded ring and racing stock, clowns
in their motley, long lines of open
dens displaying the large menagerie,
100 Shetland ponies, elephants,
llamas, elk and deer broken to har
ness; then more bands and fireworks
and the steam calliope will close the
first circus parade of the season.
WOULD SETTLE WITH CITY.â Mrs. An
nie Tarpey yesterday made an offer to settle,
for $350 a Judgment of $558 obtained against
the city for destruction of personal property
and Injuries to her husband, since deceased,
