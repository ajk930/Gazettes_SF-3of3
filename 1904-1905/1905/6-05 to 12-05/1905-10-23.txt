BABY IN ARMS VICTIM
OF DRUGGED MILK.

Edith Hey, sixteen months old, infant daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Ernest Hey,
residing at 1334 Turk street, has been critically ill for days frcrh the, effects
of drinking poisoned milk. So serious was the babe's condition that her
stomach could not retain even pure milk. The Heys' milkman was Charles
Haufe, proprietor of the Oakland Dairy, who was arrested last week and charged 5
by the State Dairy Bureau with selling cream containing formaldehyde. '-. '

Milkman lender
Charge in
Court.
Wasted to a shadow from long suf
fering, moaning- and topsing for days in
a 'fever and so stricken by disease that
\u25ba even pure milk could not be assimi
milated, little golden-haired Edith Hey.
eisteen months old, a victim of poisoned
milk, lies under the watchful eyes of
her mother at their home, 1334 Turk
street.
The chiM is the daughter of Mr. and
ltrs. Ernest Hoy. That she is a sufferer
from the drinking of a dairyman's
sophisticated wares is the opinion of
Dr. Harold JÂ«. Hill of 2325 Fillmore
letreet, who has be*n attending the in
fant. That the child's condition had
become so serious. that she could not
even take an infant's natural diet of
milk is the testimony of the mother,
who demands the prosecution of the
man whom Â«=he .charges with having
furnished the stuff that laid low her
baby.
By something that savors more than
mere coincidental with little Edith \u25a0
II e;-'K .'serious . 'Charles ~"Hauf e,
proprietor of the Oakland Dairy, who
supplied milk to the Heys, was ar
rested Thursday on complaint of
inspectors of the State Dairy Bureau.
Haufe has been tried and his case is
pending decision on a charge of having
t=old cream which contained formalde
hyde.
Mrs. Hey said yesterday she stopped
taking milk from Haufe as soon as she
learned of his arrest. But the injury,
I>erhaps permanent, to her infant's
health had been done before the dairy
Inspectors had discovered the adultera
tion.
Little Edith Hey was stricken with
in a few days after her mother had
â¢weaned the baby and had 'begun to
feed her from the bottle. The mother's
narrative of her bitter experience
opens with the child taken ill a short
time ago. She became feverish and
fretful, the' fever becoming very high
and a.ll of the symptoms of gastritis,
the form of disease which the irritant
formaldehyde produces. The baby's
mouth was badly broken out with a
Class of sores. Dr. Hill was called and,
after an examination, ordered the baby
fed nothing but milk. For five days
the infant took the milk diet until the
conditions became so serious that Dr.
Hill ordered this food stopped at once.
He had traced the cause of the trouble
to the milk and so explained to Mrs.
Hey.
The baby, who should have been
able to take such a natural food as
"milk, has been living on barley gruel
as the only item in her diet, because
. tier condition has reached such a
point.
The mother declared the baby, up
to the time of weaning, had been in
perfect health, a happy, growing child,
\u25a0without a day's serious illness since
birth to cause a setback.
BAUV ILL FROM COWS 3IILK.
'But almost the first time the dairy
man's milk was given Edith she com
menced to grow ill," continued Mrs.
Hey yesterday as she related the cir
cumstances of her baby's case. "We
had been taking milk for several years
from the Oakland Dairy, and I did not
think the milk was causing the trou
ble. When Edith was first stricken
the fever was so high I did not think
It could be controlled." The mother
continued her narrative as follows:
I lock her to Dr. Hill, who was able to
control some of the symptoms, but he thought
at the outset there might have been trouble
on account of some other food I had given
her.
After she was weaned I save her cow's
milk diluted one-third with lime water. This
vat the standard regulation for baby's milk.
Within forty-eiKht hours alter she was strick
en, the faleh fever seized the baby and she
foecan to slowly fade away. I verily believed
the had not many days to live. We kept her
on milk as the doctor had ordered until he
stopped it altogether on the opinion that the
milk was responsible for the Illness.
The ether symptoms were brought under con
trol, but the rever continues, and she is suf
fering now from the til effect* of the lone
siege. So debilitated was the child that she
caught a severe cold and 1 am compelled to
have the doctor visit her daily. .
It v. as ; after she was put on the milk ex
clusively that the real cause was disclosed.
I>r. Hill watched the symptoms closely and
tbtn. when he stopped this diet, declared:
â¢â¢The milk is responsible for this."
It was so eetious that the child could not
retain the \ milk on her stomach an instant.
Bhe would expel It just as she drank the
rtuff. Before that conditipn arose her milk
would not remain to be digested properly.
The baby was Just as healthy as she could
possibly be until she began to drink this dairy
milk. At once It seemed as If she were strick
en. There wasn't a minute, day or night.
It seems, that I wasn't at her bedside nursing
tier lam worn out by this constant strain,
and the baby Is so. far from well that I feel
great alarm over her condition.
It all seems so horrible, this . poisoning of
Innocent, helpless babies with adulterated milk.
As a mother who bas passed through a siege
of trial, distress, fear and anxiety, I appeal
to the authorities to help us and to protect
cur children from this doom of suffering.
DENOUNCES -THE OATRTMAX.
If this man whom I bold responsible for my
baby's illness had not been already arrested I
should have sworn out a warrant myself. .1

he has had no right to use the degree
of "M. D." | after his name. He has
claimed to have graduated from the

have answered in sworn . statements
that this is untrue.

He came to Boston in 1892 from New

he was in trouble over his relations

following him from Russia, he obtained
a rabbi's decree of separation from the
Molin girl. His Russian wife died in
1898 and was . burled in the Jewish
cemetery at Dedham.

of ' Daniel J. Ames of Lasalle County.

she is of age it is not known just what
steps the Ames family will take to en

that measures of the, most vigorous

KAiSKK LEGISLATES
AGAINST OUR FKUIT
Extreme Tariff Provided for
Oranges From the United
\u2666States.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 22.â A statement
of the German customs tariffs, comparing
the rates of import duty levied in Ger
many under the old and new customs
tar.fft respectively wa? given out to-day
by the Department of Commerce and LÂ»a
\u25a0bor. A table has been compiled express
ing the difference between the old and
new tariffs in ad valorem amounts based
upon the German import value of the
article in l'X3. the latest year for which
figures are available.
The specific duty on wheat is advanced
114 per cent on wheat, flour 57 per cent,
corn 212 per cent, dried fruits 150 per
cent and fresh oranges 2tM) per cent. The
conventional tariffs are tome what lower.
Thus, while oranges coming- from fa
vored nations will be subject to a dut^' of
Zt pÂ«er cent ad valorem, those imported
fmm other countries. Fuch as America,
v.ill have to pay about 89 per cent ad va
lorem. The rates on provisions also have
bo*Â»n advanced greatly.
The new tariff will be the subiect of
serious negotiation between this country
and Germany and the matter probably
will be taken up soon after the return to
America of Baron Speck yon Sternberg,
the German Embassador.

DENVER, Colo., Oct. 22.â Jeremiah
Murphy, a pumpman and stationary en

breaking and wrecking -.the engine. He
invented ah' attachment so that any jar

it on the Resurrection mine pump at
Leadville and It worked perfectly on 'two
occasions when he was not near the ma

"There was. a compound pump in the

helped, for they escaped. with^only cuts'
on the face arid bruises of their .bodies.;
Among the -witnesses to the > accident:
was Leon L. Roos of Roos Brothers." He
was a block away in. his automobile..
He speeded to the scene and offered to
take the injured to the Emergency
Hospital,' but Dr. E. G. Frisbie of 1610
Van Ness- avenue, who had- hurried,
from his nearby. residence to help the
party, said nothing could be done for;
Mrs. Planz. the younger.^ She was dead.]
Planz pulled himself together and.
with the help of bystanders carried his'
wife into the physician's residence.;
Quickly the capsized auto was -righted
and the old. mother was assisted; out of
the wreckage." The children, as soon
as they partly recovered from the stun-;
ning effects of the blow, were taken to
the Frisbie residence.- The mother was
sent to McNutt hospital, where whe was
attended by Dr. Frisbie and Dr. 1 Max.
Magnus, the "; Planz.' family physician.
Planz arid his. wife occupied the front
seat of the "car, which was a. Ford
model, 1905, a two-seater. In the back
seat were r , Planz's mother and _ his;
nieces. The upset was , so; unexpected
that Planz had not a chance to. avert
it. Just as the ear went over, he." grab-/
bed at the lever, but it' was. too \u25a0\u25a0> late.
He and his wife we.re fairly catapulted,
out of the machine as it went over. The ;
mother, Instead of trying to clear. her-,
self in the spill, clung to the back of
her seat:
UTI'LE GIRL A HEROINE.
Little Theodora, with a. remarkable
presence of mind and display of heroism
and judgment which would have done old
er heads proud, used her fragile form as
a shield for her younger sister. Theodora
said the auto ran several feet before; it
upset. She was bound her sister should
not be injured if she could prevent it.
So she gathered Irma tightly in her arms
and waited for the shoctf.': It found them
both in the street, but safe from serious
hurt.'. â¢". '\u25a0'\u25a0 _' "
The" half-crazed husband rendered
every assistance he cdlild to the
injured persons. His wife's ' body
was tenderly placed In an apartment at
Dr. Frisbie's, and then with Mrs. Schaert
zer, who had been called, Planz took
his mother to the hospital. She had re
tained consciousness through the acci
dent, and despite her Injury was able
to move about until after the hospital
was reached. There she gave strong In
dications that the pressure on her brain
was due to a fracture of the skull. The
surgeons were hopeful, as the aged wo
man rallied from the shock, that she
might not be fatally Injured.
So violent was the crash that the auto
mobile was ripped and torn as if a hun
dred axes had been used on It. The
searchlight was smashed into splinters
of .glass, the brass work being bent,
twisted and broken. The tonneau was
stripped â¢of its fastenings and the wood
work about .the seats was splintered.
The seats \u25a0â¢ we ha" Horn off- the body l " of the
machine,, although they were built of
compressed paper. The wrecked auto
was -towed to the Ford Company's gar-,
age." ' ' *
Planz bought the automobile the first
of this year. He and his wife had found
a great deal of enjoyment in its use. It
had been their custom to ride on fair
Sundays. There had not been an acci
dent until yesterday's fatality. But for
various reasons Planz had decided to dis
pose of hi 3 machine. He had received
an offer for it and he made up his mind
that yesterday's trip to the military res
ervation should be his last In that car.
PLANZ' WORDS A PROPHECY.
When the trip was settled upon Planz
and his wife drove out to the Schaert
zer's home In the Mission yesterday
morning and invited the mother and the
Schaertzer children to make the tour
Planz said as the party started:
"This is the last ride we shall take in
thÂ«> machine ana we might as well micy
ourseives while we can. I am Kolng to
sell the car this week, "and I will want
to lmvc k put In first-i'lass order. So
â¢no more runs after today."
A few hours later Planz's announce
ment way- verified as If It had been the
word of a prophet. As to the accident
Itself, Planz was unable to explain.
He said:
It all took place so quickly that- I -hardly
know what happened. We were running along
smoothly enough down Van . Ncsb avenue, on
the inclined grade between Clay and Sacra
niento streets. "\Va had slowed up just before
striking Sacramento street. Mrs. Planz Bwung
the machine over so as not to strike an ob
struction in tho street and ran In toward the
sidewalk on the east side of Van Ness 'avenue. \u25a0
She must havo been afraid the car was going
to strike the curb or a telegraph pole, for she
made a turn In the other cirectlon and the car
upset. It ran a short distance before toppling
completely over. I could not dofa thing to pre
vent the capsizing , of the machine, for It all
happened so quickly.
! Little Theodora was quite lucid concern
ing her experience/She relates the narra
tive without an idea that the role of a
heroine had been . revealed. ~Th9 child
said:
" I felt sura something was going to happen
when we turned into the curb. , My aunt tried
to get out of the way. of the telegraph pole,
and the machine, when, lt turned, ran a short
distance on two wheels. Just as it was about
to spill'' us out I grabbed Irma and pressed her
to me as closely as, I could. â¢ I thought that
'she ' would bÂ« j safer in* my ? arms If ' anything
happened:- We were thrown out of \u25a0 the seat
hard to the street, i My grandmother went un
der the machine. My ' aunt ' and uncle were
pitched out in opposite directions. % Both Irma
and myself were stunned â¢ and cut" some, but
we did net need the doctor. ,

After the wreckage had 'been cleared
nway, planz was taken to the residence of
Schaertzer, his brother-in-law. The grief
strlcken husband was beside himself fr.>m
the horror of thetragedy. He was placed
under a physician's care, /his relatives
fearing his reason might be dethroned by
the tragic experience. vBcnae-tzir, who
took, charge of affairs for. his .bereaved
brother-ln-Juw, said last night:
Planz was very devoted tq his wife. They
had been the closest of, companions, In domestic,
and in business affairs. Two years ago, when
Planz's father died, fit was a long time before
the young man recovered ; from s the blow, i In
this event .the circumstances only, enhance the
grievance" and sorrow. I know Planz will take
the accident to < himself,' .; although - he : 1b as

POPE TUTS UEGES
CIVIL MAEEIAGES
New Catechism Said to Con
tain Departure From â¢
Tradition.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Oct. 22.â A cable to the
World from Rome says a new departure
from the long standing. traditions of the
church is to be found in the . new cate
chism, which has just seen light here and
which will eventually be adopted as the
only text of Christian doctrine in every
diocese of the world. While in the past
the . church authorities were opposed to
the celebration -of the' civil. marriage cer
emony by Catholics, claiming that it was
not- necessary, as In most countries the
Catholic ceremony was recognized as
binding before the civil authorities, the
new catechism explicitly inculcates the
necessity for Catholics to contract a civil
as well as religious marriage, "in order
that the contracting parties and their
children ; may ; enjoy the civic rights of
the marriage state." :
In the same catechism, which is the
personal work of Pope Pius X, it Is. also,
stated that the Pope intends to- call to
gether an. ecumenical council "as soon as
the troubles now affecting the church are
past, in order to complete, the providen
tial work of the Vatican Council, which
was interruped by .the events of 1870."
This official and, personal statement of
the Pope has caused a sensation in Rome,
as it indicates, that -Plus X is determined
to \u25a0 prosecute to the end the work of re
form h& has begun throughout the church.

GRITTY BOY TESTS
A FLYING MACHINE
Soars Over Hudson Clinging
to a Mere Web of
': 'Wire: .
Special Dispatch to The Call.
â¢ " NEW YORK. Oct. 22.â Clinging like a
spider to ' a web of wire 500 feet above
the surface of the Hudson River with no
other support than a stout rope, from a
tugboat, a boy from Texas, with red hair,
freckfes and grit, took his life in his
hands this evening In an effort to prove
that Lawyer Israel Ludlow's aeroplane Is
the best ; thing" yet devised In flying ma
chines. \ " '
More than a thousand persons gathered
In the" western end of Seventy r ninth
street, which the ascension' was
made, and watched the daring _ "flight,
.and becamip so hvjvexl' with enthusiasm
that cheers rose in volleys. One of the
spectators, in sheer" exuberance of spir
its, plunged overboard and had to be
dragged ashore by a policeman. \u25a0 ;
Five minutes later an Intrusive ferry
boat got in the way of the tug that was
convoying the aeroplane, causing It to
change its course, so that the machine
lost the wind and dropped* to the stream
about . half- way across, and there the
aeronaut, wet only to his knees, was
picked up by a launch. â¢
This was considered a misadventure
by those interested in the enterprise, and
Ludlow. who was aboard the tug, was sat
isfied that the practicability of his inven
tion had been thoroughly demonstrated.
He added, that all it required to make It
the best of airships was motive power.
In to-day's experiment, as In the previous
ones, it was sailed In a kite fashion.

Reports are current that several

course has been very distasteful. The
administration of Economic Corpora
tions is made up of all tlie leading
commercial and financial associations
on the island and has been called upon
to act only In rare instances, as In the
present emergency. Thus far It naa
Invariably met. with success.
"The Economic Corporations com
prise bodie3 far stronger than any
combination of politicians on the
island." said Senor Francisco Oamba.
"I do not believe the present adminis
tration will continue to act for the
treaty when it thoroughly understands
that all of the business interests are in
line against it. In 1891 we were strong
enough to compel Spain to - make ";i
treaty with the United States, even
though Spanish interests were Injured.
In 1301 again we met and showed our
power, suspending all business for
three days and holding in Havana tho
largest parade ever seen in Cuba, and
without bands or uniforms created
such excitement that we then got all
the concessions we asked for. We will
win this time.

THE INSANE
A MYSTERY
Sensation Threatens in the
Dell Incompetency Case in
the Contra Costa Court
and Judge Investigates
OUTSIDE ATTORNEY
IS VERY ACTIVE
Judge Wells Orders the Old
Man Before Him and Starts
a Thorough Examination
of Odd Appearing Methods
OAJCLAXD, Oct. 22. â A case Is on
trial before Judge Wells in the Su-
PÂ«rlor Court of Contra Co3ta County
wMoh Is expected to develop a sensa
tion that may reach to other parts of
thm Suite than the cuiet town of Mar
tin**.
The case Is over the competency of
Walter K. Dell, an old-time and aged
resident of Contra Costa County, but
behind the technical legal proceedings
there Is said to be a scheme to get
control of the estates of a large num
ber of people who have been committed
to asylums In this State.
Dell has lived near the town of Pa
eheco for many years. Some time ago
he 'was declared Insane by the Superior
Court of Contra Costa County and sent
to the Stockton Asylum. I* C. Whit
tenxneyer was appointed the guardian
cf his estate. Whittenmcyer died some
time since and Mrs. Isabclle Dell, the
wit*, was appointed guardian and man
aged the property very successfully.
Suddenly an application was made by
C W. Eastin, a San Francisco attorney.
In the Superior Court of San Joaqufn
County for a writ of habeas corpus for
Dell. The application was not made
upon behalf of any nicmbor of the
family or any of the friends of the
man in the asylum. Kastin demanded
that another examination fae given the
old man and the court at Stockton ad
judged him sane.
Then Kastin begran proceedings in
Contra Co^ta County before Judge
Wells to set aside tjie guardianship
proceedings iind to have the old man
restored to the management of his
property. The heiiriMg; upon this came
up before Judgre Wells on Monday las=t.
Judge Wells wanted to know some
thing of the reason for the interest of
Kastin in the matter, and he questioned
the San Francisco attorney very care
fully from the bench.
"Where is^ Dell now?" demanded the
Judge.
"T'nder my care in San Francisco,"
replied .Kastin.
"I order you to produce him in court
for a further examination," said Judge
Wells.
It has been stated in connection with
this case that a list has been made in
Ea.iÂ» Francisco of all thÂ£ inmates of the
different asylums in the Slate who are
not violently insane and who have
property, and thai proceedings like
those in tlie Dell case will lie com
menced in each one of those other
cases. Habeas corpus proceedings will
be resorted to and the control of the
property will be secured through
guardianship proceed in grs. The friends
of Mrs. Dell assert that Etie Is the
proper r><?r.son to have control of the
estate, and there is no reason why he
should be under tiie control of any
stranger in Kan Francisco. They also
say that Dell has bt*cn worked upon
by strangers who have secured a con
trol over him by persuading him that
they were responsible for securing his
release from the asylum.
Judge Wells is going to make an in
vestigation into this '-asf: and will have
Dell before him. together with the wife,
who is still her husband's guardian. The
Interest that has been shown by Eastin
in the case of a stranger will be in
quired into.
The case has only reached a stage of
legal technicalities up to the present
time, but the next hearing is likely to
develop sorai thing more. Eastin has
merely made a motion to have the in
sanity and guardianship proceedings
set aside upon the ground that the peti
tion upon which Dell was declared in
competent was not verified. But the
rumor that this is but one of a great
many cases of a similar nature that
will "be taken up all over the State is
under the surface of the proceeding and
is likely to come out at any time.

NO ODOR OF OIL
AT UNIVERSITY
Faculty of Chicago's Great
Institution of Learning
Declares Dolliver Errs
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Oct. 22.â That there is no
taint of money in the teachings of the
University of Chicago professors and that
Senator J. P. Dolliver of lowa is alto
gether wild in his statements was the gen
eral opinion expressed to-day by midway
faculty members. This reply came in
answer to the attack made on the uni
versity by the Senator in speeches deliv
ered last night at Sedan, Kansas, in
which he said that the influence of John
D. Rockefeller's millions permeated the
teachings of " the university until the
campus smelled like a "Kansas oil town."
The university pro.'es^ors aisj deny
that a man who comes to the university
to teach ever has to change his views to
correspond with the so-called Rocke.'eller
influence.
Senator DclJiver. who based his charge
on a book written by Professor Myers of
the University of Wisconsin, tavoring the
regulation of railway rates, claims tha*.
the professor was forced to change his
views when he took a position as in
structor at the University of Chicago, as
shown by his last b-^ok In opposition to
the regulation of rates.
The mistake lies with Senator Dolliver,
pay, the University profts^crs, for the
Professor Myers he mentions never held
any position on the midway faculty. It
was Baltasher H. Myers, they say. who
wrote the book at Wisconsin Unive.si y
favoring rate regulation: but it was Hugo
R. Slyer of Harvard, who spent twelve
or fifteen years .in research, who v/rite
the book !n opposition to rate regulation.
This Professor M>vr was instructor at
tho university for six months last year.
but has not been in residence since that
time.
CITY OF ANTWERP
TO BE FORTIFIED
Twenty-One Millions May Be
Spent to Make It
Impregnable.
BRUSSELS, Oct. 22. â The autumn
session of Parliament, which opened
Wednesday last, promises to be an
eventful one. The question of fortify
ing Antwerp and making that city
practically impregnable against a na
val attack ifc the lirst important mat
ter to be considered.' The plan of the
Government for a new advanced line
of fortifications will entail an expendi
ture of $21,600,000, and in conjunction
with the building of these fortifica
tions, it is proposed to enlarge the Ant
werp docks to about twice their pres
ent size. The Government bill prob
ably will pass, notwithstanding the op
position to the heavy expense involved.
The auestlon of the definite status
of the Congo Independent State will
also be considered. The impression
prevails in diplomatic circles that the
Governments of Great Britain and Ger
many wish to terminate the reign of
King "Leopold as absolute sovereign of
the Congo Independent- State and to
oblige Belgium to definitely annex the
state. It is probable that .if asked to
take final action, both houses of Par
liament will give substantial majori
ties to the annexation' of the Congo
as an integral part of the kingdom
of Belgium.

Grand Officers and Members of Catholic
Order Exemplify Its New Ritual.
SANTA ROSA. Oct. 22.â Rev. Father J.
M. Cassin, rector of the Church of St.
Rose in this city, addressed the visiting
grand officers and many members of the
Young Men's Institute, who attended
high mass this morning. The visitors
were here to initiate a large class into
the order, and included some two hun
dred or more members of the order from
San Fancisco, Oakland, Alarneda, San
Rafael, Petaluma and Sonoma. and the
surrounding country as well as the grand
officers. . - . .
The visitors arrived on a special train
at 10:30 and were met at the depot by
Santa Rosa Council, No. 308, with a band.
There was a parade through the principal
streets of the city, after -which all went
to the church for the service. There was j
special music of a high order provided J
by the choir, consisting of Mrs. 'J. P.
Berry, leader, and Mrs. A. T. N^oodward,
Mrs. A. S. Rodgers, Mrs. D. R. Gale,
Mrs. J. D. Davis, Frank Carroll Glffen,
Paul Clary, W. E. Woodward and J.
C. O'Donnell.
i Father Cassin in his address spoke of
the peculiar circumstances and'unusual
ness of his facing a strange audience In
his own church, but declared that where
ever one went of the Catholic faith he
was sure to find the same religion and
modes of worship. The same was true,
he said regarding the time, whether 500
years ago, to-day, or 500 years hence.
j "This is the age," said he, "when the
; church needs energetic laymen. This
gives you young men a great field of
labor. Some think the priest should do
all the work of the chuich. This is not
soÂ» There is a place for every layman
in his sphere. Your society was organized
for the* purpose of training the young
men for the work of the church and its
spread all over this country and to Alas
ka, and the islands of the sea proves
how much it. was needed and how well
it is doing its work."
This afternoon ihe grand officers and
the visiting degree team initiated a class
into the membership of the order, using |
the work of the new third-degree ritual
for the first time in this part of the State.

SAILORS SCARCE
IN THE NORTH
Mariners and Railroad La
borers Are Badly Needed in
Sound Ports and Alaska
&I*clal Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Oct. 22.â 80 th sailor^ and
railroad laborers are very scarce in
Washington and Oregon. This is the' nat
ural result of the great amount of rail
road . bujlding now in progress, together
with the employment of the. maximum
number of sailing vessels to carry away
the grain and lumber products of the Pa
cific Northwest. Frank Kelley, employ
ment agent of the Alaska . Central Rail
road, has arrived from Seward to engage
300 workmen, who' will be sent north as
fast as possible. They are to replace 300
laborers who have left railroad work to
stampede to the Yentna gold-diggings,
recently discovered soy th of Mount For
aker, in Susitna Valley. The exodus to
Yentna started in: September, when one
miner arrived at Seward with $400 in gold
as the result of five weeks' work.
Sailers are so scarce on Puget Sound as
to cause difficulty in securing crews for
every departing vessel. The ship John
Currier, sailing yesterday, spent nearly
two weeks at Port Townsend obtaining a
crew. The ships Glenalvon and Helens
burg have had difficulty ... in obtaining
crews in Tacoraa. Sailor boarding-house
keepers offer no hopeof improvement,
since incoming fleets comprise tramp
steamships, whose crews will not leave
for sailing vessels. " ; .

anos will be selected in the different

make money easier than by saving it?
True, we have a large number of pianos

OAKLAND, Oct. 22.â Not only has 1.
B- Small of Oswego. Oregon, lost his
wife but, he claims, some of his children
have deserted him since the woman who
ewore to honor and obey him ran off with
another man.
Small is still in Oakland, and he says
that he intends to stay here until the
rat; who disrupted his home Is brought
to justice. For the daughter who fol
lowed in her mother's footsteps, he has
no fear, for she is now in an institution
in San Francisco. According to his
friends. Small's love for his wife is gone.
Mrs. Small and her paramour, John
Giant, are in jail at Martinez and neith
er seems sorry for the 6tep taken in 1903 ,
that broke up the home of the Smalls.
"My husband treated me cruelly," said
Mrs. Small to-day, '"and when Grant
came to our house he offered me sym- .
pathy. 1 was tired of my husband's
abuse and finally, in despair, I decided to
join Grant.
"I went from Oswego to Seattle, where
Grant joined me later. Finding that my
husband was on our track, we went to
Monticello, in California, where we re
mained four months. When we learned
that my husband knew of our where
abouts, we moved to Point Richmond
end lived at the Golden Gate Hotel and
later kept house on Tunnel avenue. It
was while we were in Point Richmond
that my husband overtook us.
""1 do not think that Small cares for
me. He wants my property. In fact, he
pent me word that if 1 would deed to him
property valued at $2000 in Oregon, he
would not prosecute me for living with
Mr. Grant. 1 know that I have sinned
before heaven and before man, but I was
simply trying to avoid my' husband and
his cruelty."
Grant takes his arrest philosophically
and has little to say. He quietly admits
that he ran away with Mrs. Small, and
cays he did it because he knew of the
aluse her husband heaped upon "her and
btcause he was sorry for her.
Small denies that he was ever cruel to |
his wife. He was a man of considerable
property In Orrgon, owning a hotel itt
Oswego and farming property adjoining
the town. When his wife left him two
years ago he sold considerable of this
property and began a systematic search
for her. He brought, his three children
to Los Banos and left them" there while
he roamed about the country in search
of the erring pair. To add to his family
troubles, his eldest daughter, Emma, a
giri of 16. ran away from home last De
cember. She was caught in Oakland and
Ie now in a school in San Francisco,
where her father had her placed.
Small has sent for his other three chil
dren and they are expected to arrive here
to-morrow. He expects to use their tes
timony in prosecuting his wife and her
paramour.
"It is true that I made overtures to my
wife," said Small to-day. "I told her
that I would drop the prosecution against
her if she would tell the truth about
Grant and deed her property to her chil
dren. It was not in the nature of a
threat. I think I would take her back
now if she would come to me repentant.
She owns property in Oregon valued at
about $3000, and I want her to give that
to the children she has borne. I ask
nothing for myself. If this woman who
has piayed me false and for whom I
have been searching for two years will
do the right thing by the children I shall
be satisfied, so far as she is concerned,
but 1 shail still prosecute Grant. It is
he who wrecked my home.
"Emma, my daughter, declares that she
has not eeen her mother since we left
Oswego. I believe, however, that the
child kept her mother informed of my
movements and prevented me from find-
Ing her before. My boy Tom has aided
me in every way. alhough he is now little
over 15.
"I have spent $1200 already in this
search and I shall expend my last cent
to see Grant suffer for his transgressions.
If he is turned loose at Point Richmond,
look out for me. Our family was one of
the most respected in Oswego before my
wife ran away. The respectable people
we entertained little knew of the internal
strife until that woman cast conventions
to the winds and ran away with a sec
tion hand."

Woman Wh o Passed as Wife
of Milton Andrews Identi
fied as an Adventuress
BETKAYED BY ACCENT
Colorado Police Send to Mar
shal Vollmer a Descrip
tion of Much Wanted Girl
| BERKELEY, 'Oct. 22.â Following close
â¢ upon the heels of . the dispatch from
{ Denver to-day, which proved that Milton
I Andrews' female companion, as yet un
'. Identified, Is not Julia Ward, came to-day
.& letter to Marshal. Vollmer from W.S.
, Reynolds, former chief of police of Col
j orado Springs, providing new information
j with respect to the past career of Milton
j Andrews' present "wife." v .
' Reynolds says that Andrews, who was
J sought for by the police of Colorado
, Springs for the fiendish murder of Bessie ,
I Bouton last October, had with him when :
j last heard of, in Michigan, a woman com-
I panion whom he picked up in Michigan.
I a French-Canadian girl, named Nulda
Petre Olivia.
| This information tallies with William
Ellis' description of Andrews' female
'partner, for Ellis says she was always i
I called Nulda, and In other ways the two !
descriptions of the woman, given by El- I
Us and Chief Reynolds of Colorado j
Springs, tally. Marshal Vollmer is con.,
vinced that Andrews' wife is not ; Julia
Ward, of Denver, that identification
never having been positive here, and be
ing made quite worthless by the appear
ance of Miss -Ward In Denver at this
time.
The letter received by Marshal Vollmer
from Chief Reynolds of Colorado Springs
is as follows:
Dear Sir â The description of the man want
ed' in your city for assault fills thÂ« bill of
Mtlton Franklin Andrews, wanted here for
the murder of BesÂ»lÂ« Bouton. You mentioned
tn your letter that he had a number of fancy
vests. Franklin was a great fellow for vests
and .had several made in Denver. Will you
look up the makers' names and if you can find
any send me a list of them. Did you find
any laundry marks on his clothes? If so, I
can tell by them if he is Franklin.
The; last trace I had of them waa up in
Michigan and he was heading for Boston. At
that time he had a woman with him whom he
had picked up in that State. The descrip
tion I got of her was follows: The name she
gave was Nulda Petre Olivia. I see the woman
tn your circular was named Nulda, which
makes . me think she is the iame party. Her
height was five feet- two inche?; weight, 115 to
120: age, about 18; dark eyes; very black hair;
medium build; dark complexion. The party
who furnished me with her description said
she looked like a French woman and talked
with a French accent. She had a larue tur
quoise ring, surrounded with about twenty
small diamonds, and I see in your description
the Brush woman had a ring set with dia
monds. The Bouton woman had a ring of thts
description.
William Ellis, now in the hospital here,
convalescing from his injuries sustained
when Andrews attempted to murder him,
a fortnight ago, was shown Chief Rey
nolds' description of Andrews' female
companion and said:
That description fits the Andrews woman
perfectly, and is precisely the sort of descrip
tion 1 gave the police the night Andrews tried
to kill me. Her name, Nulda, is peculiar and
\u25a0O far as I know she has never .changed it.
She was short, black hatred, yo years old, worÂ»
the ring this Colorado Springs man writes of,,
and also she spoke with a French accent. She
talked often of Montreal and other Canadian
places, and seemed to regard them as homo.
I know, too, that she had been in Buffalo,
and had been married thereto a proprietor of
several saloons, a man named Steele. She
used to say that she had been with Andrews
lor about eighteen months, and if that is true
she must have been with Andrews when he
murdered this Bouton woman in Colorado.
Ellis' deposition, embodying , all the
facts that relate to Andrews' and the
woman's murderous assault upon him a
week ago last Wednesday, will be taken
before District Attorney Allen as soon
as Ellis is able to leave the hospital,
which will be during the coming week.
With the deposition intact, there will
be comparatively little demand from Ellis
at Andrews' trial, in the way of direct
testimony, assuming that Andrews ever
is captured b%- the police. Ellis, accord
ingly, will find himself free to leave for
Australia whenever he desires, after his
deposition is taken. - \u25a0 \u25a0

BUYING TRACTS
IN THE COUNTRY
Section Between Oakland and
San Leandro Is Given At
tention by Speculators
BIG BOOM IS EXPECTED
Construction of the Western
Pacific and the Key Route
Doubles the Value of Land
- OAKLAND. Oct. 22.â The fact that
work upon the Western Pacific Railroad
has all but begun has turned the atten
tion of speculators to, the country between
Oakland and Hay wards, and there is ev
ery indication' that there will be an ac
tivity In that direction this winter equal
to : the activity that followed the con
struction of the Santa Fe through Ber
keley into Oakland. \u25a0
"The conditions south of Oakland are
â¢similar to the conditions that existed
a few. years ago between Oakland and
Berkeley. There is the : promise of the
construction of another overland railroad
through this section, and the Oakland
Taction ( Company Is preparing to recon
struct its Hay wards line so as to ulti
mately r carry> Key Route cars right
through Fruitvale, Fltchburg. . Elmhurst.
San Leandro and Into Hay wards. When
these are accomplished facts it is expected
that there will be a boom in real estate
similar to that which followed railroad
construction . In Berkeley.
There Is. a movement, more in tracts
of land than In small lots in this sec
tion. i f Speculators know that there Is
money to bo made tn purchasing tracts
and sellng them off In lots when the
railroad construction begins, and acre
age Is in demand. "
The only thing that Is delaying a defin
ite boom in this section is a little uncer
tainty about the exact route of the West
ern Pacific between Oakland and Nllesi
Surveyors are working In every direc
tion, and no less than half a dozen routes
have been surveyed, but none selected.
When the exact route is chosen there will
be a scramble to get in at bottom prices.
Land could have been purchased two
years ago in this section for about half
the figure that It is now held at since
the Western Pacific has become an as
sured fact. \u25a0
Fred A. Campbell has succeeded S. P.
Meads in the real estate firm of Meads
& Bell, the firm now. becoming Bell &
Campbell.- Mr. Campbell is thoroughly
acquainted with Oakland real estate. He
has lived here ever since 18C5 and has
been a witness of the wonderful develop
ment upon this side^of the bay; he Is
very well known in Oakland.
The Fruitvale Garage. Company will
construct new quarters in that section,
and will begin to operate upon an elab
orate scale.
The Rudell Real Estate Company of
Fruitvale is issuing a weekly sheet known
as the Fruitvale Bulletin, devoted to the
advancement of that section, and giving
a list of real estate that can be pur
chased In that neighborhood. They es
timate that more than $25,000 worth of
real estate has been sold In Fruitvale In
the last month, and that building con
tracts amounting to $60,000 have been
placed.
Charles F. Lee has purchased from Otto
A. Petersen the northeast corner of
Fruitvale avenue and Washington street,
and will erect thereon a three-story gran
ite building.
The Fruitvale Board of Trade will hold
a meeting during the first week in No
vember to discuss incorporation. Dele
gates will be present from every improve
ment club or organization of similar char
acter between the Oakland city lino and
San Leandro, and the matter of- turning
this unincorporated section into a city
will be thoroughly gone over. The north
west corner of Telegraph and Du
rant avenues In Berkeley has been sold
by the Mason-McDufne Company for W.
E. Knowles to Charles H. and E. M.
Wall of Alameda. 1 The sale price was
$17,500, and the purchasers will erect
thereon a building to cost $30,000.
The Berkeley Real Estate Exchange
held its annual banquet during the last
week. The â¢ meeting appointed a com
mittee consisting of Dr. Lyman Allen,
Oliver Youngs, Philo Mills, P. F. Brad
hoff, Walter Woolsey and M. P. AJ
beeto confer, with the local Board of
Trade about forming one central organ
ization that would take in hand the gen
erar advertising of Berkeley. Many im
portant suggestions were made by the
different speakers. It was Dr. Lyman
Alton's idea that caused the appointment
of the above committee. \u25a0 Oliver Young 3
spoÃe upon the necessity of high stand
ards In the. real estate business. P. F.
Bradhoff made several suggestions about
beautifying Berkeley and utilizing
the many , natural advantages of
the . town. . George Sully wanted a
booklet issued about Berkeley for general
circulation. M. P. Albee advanced the
very excellent Idea of a union depot for
both the Key Route and the Southern'
Pacific. ln the heart of Berkeley.
The Oakland Board of Trade has com
municated with : the City Council about
relieving the congestion of travel at the
corner of Fourteenth . street and . Broad
way. They want a portion of the Play
ter property bought by the city before
the new building Is erected thereon. A
committee consisting of C. J. Heeseman,
Hugo Abrahamson and C. L. Smith was
appointed to confer with other organiza
tions about running excursions into Oak
land from outside towns.

MOSCOW IUILROAD
TRAFFIC PARALYZED
Cit.y Shut Off From Commun
ication With the Rest of
the World.
MOSCOW, Oct." 22.â Traffic on seven of
the nine main trunk arteries of com
merce radiating from Moscow was com
pletely paralyzed to-day by the railroad
strike, and the commercial heart of Rus
sia has been shut off from all communi
cation with the rest of the Empire, ex
cept with . the narrow section to the
Northwestward, Including St. Peters
burg and the Baltic 'provinces. Though
the government has ordered the railroad
battalions of the army to proceed to Mos
cow and take . the places of the strikers
for the' purpose of. restoring traffic, the
revolutionists, by 1 a sudden and unexpect
ed blow, have shown their, ability to lay
their hands on the throats of the na
tion's commercial life.
The employes, of four railroads struck
to-day, and only the lines running over
the - Nlcholal road . to St. Petersburg and
over the Windau and : Rybinsk road to
Riga and other Baltic ports are open.
Traffic is at a standstill on the .Kazan
line and on the line to Yaroslav ' and
Archangel. The strikers ~. to-day forced
the employes , of the general offices and
financial departments of .three lines, the
Windau and Rybinsk, ; the Moscow and
Brest-Lltovsk and.the-Kieff and Voron
esth to quit work. *
The city . Is already feeling .the effect
of a milk and meat famine, and a few
days' continuance of .the "strike : will
cause serious embarrassment and '. even
suffering. to the population. The renewal
of the factory, strikes Is not Improbable. '-:

. Completion of the Work
Special Dispatch to The Call.
1 PALO ALTO. Oct. 22.â Befora an excited
meeting of local residents with the Board
of Trade last night, Dr. J. C. Branner,
the geologist of Stanford University, said â¢
that if the Spring Valley Water Company
wa3 not prevented from boring: wells
along the bay, the water supply^ of Palo
Alto, Stanford University, Mayfleld and
Leal's addition will be stopped. .
The magnitude of the danger was
further explained when it was assarted
that no reservoir site In the hills is pos->
iible to furnish this locality. The sols
source of supply Is in the artesian wells
and their value to Palo Alto 13 becoming
less each day.
Charles and Hall, who investigated the
operations cf the Spring: Valley Company,
reported that they were thrown off the
premises near Cooley'a landing by a
guard. They said admittance was strict
ly prohibited and that the boring of wells
was being carried on in greatest secrecy.
Cooley, owner of some of the land near
the scene of operations, told of the lower
ing of water In the wells oh his place
from one to three feet since the wells
were bored by the Spring Valley Com
pany.
The Indignation of the people present In
creased with the recitation of Impending
danger. All were in favor of recourse to
law in order to prevent the work. The
Stanford University trustees will ba en
listed to support the cause, and the May
field people will be asked to co-operate
when the time comes to act.

Tugs to Meet Miss
Roosevelt and
Harriman.
~ There was a great deal of guessing
and discussion along the water front
yesterday regarding the time of the ar
rival of the Siberia from Yokohama,
and what speed she would make across
the Paiclflc.
Ab she Is reported to be making a
record run, all kinds of guesses were
hazarded. She lias Mr. Harriman and
family and Mi*s Roosevelt and party
en board, and naturally with these dis
tinguished personages as passengers a
double Interest Is taken In her arrival
here. In order to make the same time
as the Korea'made when she brought
Secretary Taft across she should ar
rive here by 9:50 .this morning. This
would make her time of run ten days
and eleven hours. It is expected, how
ever, that she will beat this time and
come In early this morning. On her
trial trip the Siberia steamed twenty-one
knote an hour, whereas the Korea only
made nineteen knots an hour on her
trial trip.
The tues Slocum and Arabs had
r?am ut> last night, ready to go / to.
meet her at daybreak this morning, or
as soon thereafter as the quarantine
officers had finished their examinations.
The Slocum will bring Miss Roosevelt
find party ashore, and the Arabs will
land Mr. Harriman and family.

PASTOR DEFINES
UNITARISM
Rev. B. Leavitt Discusses
the Exclusion of His People
From Church Federation
LEADERS LIBERAL MEN
Darwin, Huxley; and Spencer
Given as Samples of the
Future Seekers, of Truth.
"Unitarians Not Wanted" was the sub
ject of the Rev. Bradford Leavitt's-ser
mon at the First - Unitarian - Church,
Geary and Franklin streets, yesterday
morning.
Among other things Mr. Leavitt said:
Unitarian. ism is the religion' of common
sense. It lays down no creed. It proclaim*
everywhere that opinion In religion is perfectly
free and that there Is no moral quality In
herent in belief or disbelief. Everything in the
more popular creeds of, Christendom whioh
makes hard demands on reason, which.' seems
harsh. Incredible, repulsive, - Unitarians put
aside. Yet this religion, ao human, so rational,
so simple, is of all the most unpopular, not
co much with the laity as with thÂ« clergy of
the creed-bound churches. The last manifes
tation of hostility is the exclusion of the
Unitarian delegates, E. B. Hall, ex-Secretary
Long and President Eliot, from the National
Church Federation.
We have no resentment. TVe are not sur
prised. The action is perfectly, consistent. If
assent to certain dogmas is necessary to sal
vation, and disbelief should be cut out root
and branch, then we should be excommuni
cated, for we do not accept the dogmas of the
fall of man, of original sin, etc.," nor believe \u25a0
that any dogmas are essential. .
We have one distinct and definite aim â to
find out the truth, and welcome it from what
ever source It come. We accept the teachings
of science. We hold that truth is so safe that
nothing can harm it and that God Is behind It
pushing it forward. Who have we In our fel
lowship outside the <ence? Nearly every one
of the strong, masterful men who created this
nation, and the group of \u25a0 literary mÂ«n who
made the last century of America famous.
They say we are not Christians â that de
pends on your definition of Christianity. In
any case we are not on the defensive in this
matter. Those who deny us â¢ the name may
answer for their denial. The reason the church
is losing its hold on the educated mÂ«n and
women of to-day Is not to be found In Chris
tianity, but in the church's presentation of it.
The old dogmas are not large enough to hold
the steadily advancing knowledge of the world.
All the leaders in the world's thought are
liberal men; and the church of the future must
be big enough to contain devoted truth seekers
like Darwin and Huxley and Herbert Spencer.
Xo one who studies modern science can ac
cept the. theology of the Middle Ages or the
Genesla storiea of the creation of the world
and the fall oilman, things of which Jesus
never epeaks but upon which the church's
whole theology is based. And our business
now should be not to try to discredit the the
ology of the priests, who seem to be firing
dynamite under their own windows, but to
proclaim to the great mass of men and wom
en outside the church garrisons that though
theologies are discredited religion remains and .
will remain; and that whatever Is found to be
true. Is a part of God's great Bible.
Crazed Cook Wields Knife.
Crazed by liquor, Thomas Berry, a cook
residing at 464 First street, wielded a
small knife in a wine resort on Sacra
mento street, near Kearny, last night.
Kerry attacked William P. Hemingway,
of 3720 Twenty-third street, and in
flicted a wound across the latter's
throat. F. J. Widman, of 634 Sacra
mento street, then attempted to disarm
Berry and was cut in the arm. J.
Buckanmier, who conducts the resort.
Interfered and received a cut on the
face. All three men were treated at
the Harbor Receiving Hospital: Police
man Jack' Stelzner, who was attracted
by calls for help, rushed to the place,
and after a short struggle gained pos
session of the knife, and arrested Berry.
The dlsnute arose over the Question as
to who should pay. for a round of
drinks.
Sorcetimes you feel that you need a
"third hand"; and that's what a want
advertisement will be to you in most
any emergency of daily life.
Perils of Cutting: Misnouri Corn.
Allan Jamison had a trying experience
while cutting corn for Rev. M. A. Wolf
in the Osage Bottoms the /other day.
He was working away when suddenly
something struck him, knocking him to
the ground, where he remained for some
time in an unconscious state. He finally
recovered, and although badly v bruised
up was able to get home. The next day
he went back to the field in Â» the hopes
of finding what struck him and was re
warded. There were two ears of corn
that had fallen from the stalk he was
cutting on. The torn-up condition of the'
ground indicated that he had struggled
hard to get from under the big nubbins
that held him down. The above incident
was not reported by Rev. Mr. "Wolf, but
comes from a more reliable source â
namely, Allan himself.â Metz Times.
Character aa Collateral.
It is worthy of note <hat all financial
institutions of any responsibility regard
good character as the best basis for suc
cessful business operations. It is the fun
damental basis of present business meth
ods and of all commercial Intercourse.
Integrity and confidence are necessary
to modern dealing. In fact, It Is by in
tegrity and confidence that the great
volume of dally transactions la carried
on. Paper is accepted whose. value de
pends wholly on the Integrity of^lti
maker. A system of checks enables busi
ness men and banks to pay a vast amount
of obligations every day with a corres
pondingly small use of actual money.
All of these transactions, are based on
integrity and confidence.â Seattle Post-
Intelllgencer.
CtTTS HIS THROAT.â James Hart, an &*ed
man, despondent from adverse conditions, tried
to end his life yesterday by severing the jugu
lar vein with a razor. That he was unsuccess
ful was - due to the dullness of : the razor, as
he clashed his throat several times. Hart waa
treated by Dr. Kuclch at the Central Emer
gency Hospital and has a good chance of re
covering.

MACK PICTURES
POET HAPPILY
Tom Moore Fares Well in
Comedy of the Name Given
at the Columbia Theater
SUPPORT IS; EXCELLENT
Much to Enjoy in Perform
ance That: Abounds- in
bright Lines of Sayre's
/Poets have fared worse in a,good many
plays than Tom" Moore in Theodore Burt
Sayre's comedy off the .'name at the Co
lumbia this week. And poets have fared
worse at many hands than Tom Moore
fares f at Andrew Mack's. 1 -. The first â¢ act
of the comedy is unhopeful. It Is rather
like Chaunoey Olcott without Chaufacey.
That is, it lugs in a lot -of Impossible
children to be-^sung at and otherwise
made into scenery, and introduces â¢ one
into more or less trustful company gen
erally, the kind of folk you meet in Ol
cott'B Ireland only. '"But Mr. Mack is not
Chauncey when ho sings. You' wish he
were. But then Mr. Mack Is not Chaun
cey when he acts, and there Is reason to
be grateful for that.
The play goes, on pleasantly after the
first act. Moore is first - found |In the
little Irish schoqlhouse making love to
the BChoolma'am,' Bessie Dyke. The vil
lain also,' Bir Perclval Lovelaco, real
nice and bad. la also engaged in thÂ» same
occupation. He plots to set Miss Dyke
to London by offer, of- patronage for
papa, a minor poet, and by the offer of a
position in Drury Lane Theater for her
self. :;;- : : :
ThÂ» next act finds Miss Bessie leading
lady at Drury" Lane â never mmd â and
Tom Moore starving in his garre^ In Lon
don, twelve months afterward. HÂ© has
here an attractive and familiar scene with
his landlady. She wants the rent. Land
ladies always do. Moore hasn't it.
Geniuses never have. Moore sings "Dove's
Young Dream" and she gives him 'until
Saturday to pay. She always does. But
'tis pleasantly done, and Moore's faithful
servant is as good as Beau Brummel's
man In helping things along.
The third act finds Moore arm in arm
with the Prince Regent at a reception,
feted, successful, still in love with Bes
sie, who has flouted him. There the vil
lain gets Bessie into his power, by threat
ening to throw her father Into Fleet street
prison for debt, with Tom Moore to thÂ«
rescue and it all ends happily. Besides
Moore one Is introduced to Sheridan, to
MacDermott, the publisher, and Lord
Alorra, Moore's patron. .v
Mr. Mack gives a very pleasant picture
of the poet. He gives Mr. Sayre's many
witty lines with point and drollery and
brings a rarely genuine note of pathos
Into the portrait. Mr. Mack once proba
bly sang very well. Sympathy and taste
are still apparent in his singing. But
there *is not much else. He has some up
stairs notes that are still almost good,
the Dick Jose kind, but vocally that is
about all. Luckily there is not much
singing, and that judicious. For the rest,
Mack's Moore is thoroughly likable, thor
oughly attractive, and made many friends
last night.
Josephine Lovett, a San Francisco
girl, was the Bessie Dyke. She has at
tractive .moments, but as a whole the
performance lacks color and charm.
Another San Franciscan, Philip Walsh,
lent individuality to the small part of
Lord George Wynne.
The rest of the cast, offered Mr. Mack
unusually .effective, support, beginning 1
with Edwin Brandt's 1 excellent Lovelace
and Eddie Heron's Capital Buster. < .-W.
J. Butler again distinctly makes him
self felt as Sheridan, 'and Albert An
drass Is quite royal as the Prince of
"Wales., George W. Deyo is useful as
Bessie's father and John Robertson is
not to be forgotten as Terence Farrell.
But "Tom Moore" should be seen, if
only to see faithful through four acts

How happy could I be with either

BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
Grand.
"In Old Kentucky" began Its second
week last night at the Grand Opera
house, before an audience that filled the
auditorium to Its utmost seating ca
pacity. The musicians were obliged to
give up their places in the orchestra and
take to the stage, and their seats were
filled with spectators. Hundreds were
turned- away long before the curtain rose
for the first act. .
. The play went with great snap and
vim. The music of the "Woodlawn Wang
doodles was encored again and again. . "In
Old Kentucky" will run all the week,
closing on Saturday night. The picka
ninnies of the company have been chal
lenged by a number of local dancers for
a contest to-night in champion buck and
soft-shoe dancing. A large number .- of
handsome prizes have been put up for
this contest by local firms. . The event
will take place in the second act.
Next Sunday, both matinee and even-
Ing, "Peggy From Paris" will be given.
These will be the only performances of
George Ade's comedy-opera in . this city.
Orphenm.
The most attractive thing at tho Or
pheum this week is a dozen or so of as
sorted girls in a, ballet. The funniest
thing Is a trick mule. The rest of : the
bill Is hardly worth postponing your
evening at home to see. . .:v \u25a0' '
The dozen damsels who share the hon
ors with the mule call : themselves the
Twelve Broomstick ' Witches. They sing
a little,' kick a great, deal, but the best
thing they do is to move around and look
pretty. They are j fairly successful in
this. - â¢ . : :
The mule, which comes for his oata
when called by the name of Jasper, is,
with Clayton and Jenkins In the "Dark
town Circus." One of the pair has a
make-up and some gags that remind one
of -Slivers; the king of circus- clowns.
O'Brien and Buckley do a mixture of
freak \u25a0 musical* turns and some lively di
alogue. . Sbme.of their; gags are old. but
they have some good new ones that make
"up for the- several chapters of ancient
history they, spring.

PRESIDENT HAS
DIP IN THE SEA
Goes From St. Augustine to
Anastasia Island, Where
He Dons a Bathing Suit
SPENDS A; QUIET DAY
Attends Chu rch in Morning
and in tlie Evening Takes
the Train for Alabama
""ST. AUGUSTINE. -Fla... Oct.; 22.-Pres
ident Roosevelt 'started .'to-night for his
tour. of Alabama, He .leftist. -Augustine
at 9 o'clock to-night and 1b not scheduled
to make a stop of v any length Y until he
reaches ',, Mobile '\u25a0 to-morrow afternoon at
4:30 o'clock. '
His day In St. Augustine was a quiet
one. He attended; services In, the Presby
terian j Memorial Church at 111 o'clock.
The pastor, " Rev. : James CofHn-Stout,
preached .from the text "Worthy, the
Lamb That Was^Slain." He made no ref
erence to the President in his sermon.
The church was.orowded. At the con
clusion of the services the President was
taken for a short drive about the city..
After luncheon the ," President, accom
panied by Secretary Loeb, Surgeon Gen
eral Rixey. John Mcllhenny . and John
Greenway, the last two of whom have
been his guests on the trip South, drove
to Fort Mertion, where they, boarded a
launch and went to Anastasia Island.
Here the party donned bathing suits and
had, a swim in the salt water. .
The President greatly enjoyed the bath
and seemed In excellent condition to
tackle the hard work which lies before
him this. week. -.
When the party .., left ; the hotel for the
fort the mounted policemen of St. Augus
tine, who had been waiting in front of the
hotel, started ahead as an escort. The
secret service man, . who was on the box
with the driver of the President's car
riage, said to one of them: "We don't
need you now.".
."That's all right." responded the offi
cer, "we will go along."
They galloped to the fort, .where they
stood at attention while 'the President
boarded the launch and steamed away. ;
Dinner was served at the hotel to-night,
after which the President drove to his
train.
St. Augustine was full of strangers to
day, attracted by the President. A large
crowd lingered around his hotel all day
anxious to catch a glimpse of him. He
received but few visitors, however, and
got the rest of which he stood In need.
This week will see the end of his trip.
After visiting. Mobile to-morrow, he will
spend Tuesday at Tuskegee, Montgomery
and Birmingham. Wednesday he will de
vote to Little Rock, Ark., and Thursday
he will . visit New Orleans, leaving that
evening on a Government vessel for
Washington.
TALLKST CONCRETE - STACK
'_'. EVER CONSTRUCTED
It Is Over Three Hundred Feet High
and Ist Built In Tyro
Farts.
Tacoma, "Wash., claims to include
among Its objects of interest the lofti
est concrete chimney In the world. It
belongs ,to the Tacoma Smelter Com
pany and has just been completed.
From the base of the foundation to
the top of the chimney is 307 feet 6?i
Inches, and the cost was $28,000. -The
stack was built to carry away the
poisonous fumes "from the smelting
works at Tacoma. In Its construction
1225 barrels of cement were used, in
addition to Which the structure con
tains 105,000 pounds of T iron, 705
cubic yards of sand and 231 cubic yards
of gravel. Towering more than 100
yards from the- earth, and without a
supporting guy, this chimney, because
of its relatively narrow base, presents
a very striking appearance.
1 The concrete foundation Is 86% feet
square and 6 feet thick. For the chim
ney proper the mixture was one part
cement and three parts sand.
The chimney is constructed In two
parts. From the foundation to a
height of 90 feet there are two distinct
shells, one built within the other, while
for the rest of Its height It Is built
with a single, shell. ,
The purpose of the double shell is
to protect the structure from cracks
and strains due to extreme variations
of temperature. The inner shelly which
is separated from the outer one* by an
air space of flve * Inches, is designed
to shield the outer shell from the direct
effect of the Intense heat at the basa
of the chimney, while the outer serves
as a like protection to the inner shell,
by shielding from cold weather, which
might cause It to crack by cooling too
suddenly. â Scientific American.
Readers In Cigar Factories.
He Is a : singular , figure, this paid
reader, found in virtually every one of
the large Havana cigar J factories and
many of the smaller galeras. When an
American corporation acquired one of
the famous Havana brands some time
ago and^housed it in a great new build
ing at 10 \u25a0' Zulueta it was decided
that no reader would bo permitted to
practice his calling In the galeras.
"Within la, few. months all the clgar
.makers In this feaderless factory be
came mutinous and went upon a strike,
and assoon as the difficulty was set
tled the readers were' admitted. The
factory at 10 Zulueta now has three of
them.
"It keeps the tabaqueros quiet," ex
plains the Spanish foreman. The
American superintendent adds that
clgarmakers in Cuba cannot talk unless
they use their' hands, so reading In
creases the routput of the plants. But
i the tabaquero works wholly by the
piece, bo that time wasted Is his own
loss. Reading Is. ."quieting," In that It
gives active minds something whole
some to think about. U ,
The reader sits aloft In n*mall railed
box resembling a pulpit, placed at the
center of the workroom, so that his
voice may carry to all parts of the
galera. -.He reads three hours daily,
commonly In the afternoon. By
long custom half of this time is given
up to^newspapers, chiefly those of Ha
vana, though some readers of more
than average, education ;read from
American ;. papers, translating .as they
go. The .remaining hour, and a half is
given up to novels.â -Bookman.

the Hiding Place of the
Remainder of His Loot
PITTSBURG, Pa., Oct. 22.â Edward G.
Cunliffe, the express robber, In a long In
terview in a local paper. - denies that he
took , the odd ~*looO with which he Is
charged, in addition to the $100,000 Adams
Express -Company package, and states
that his * object "in going to Bridgeport,
Conn.,:, was to - obtain employment on
one of the oyster boats^of the Bridgeport
fleet, a plan that was frustrated by the
fact that the j boats were not working "on
account of ; some labor trouble.
He ; Indignantly denied that he ad
vanced to a Bridgeport | woman money
to rent a fiat, saying he spent his time
in 'walking about and- listening to com
ments on the- robbery instead of roistering
around the tenderloin s district. â¢
- Cunliffe shipped the $80,000 In a suit case
to Bristol, he said. In care of the ex
press company, figuring on that as the
most unlikely place' the detectives woqld
search. When , questioned as to the $11.- '
000\ still .'missing he evaded reply by rail
ing, against the fates which led to the
discovery of the $80,000.
â¢ Cunliffe denounces James Missett of
Birdgeport, who informed the Pinkertons
of his whereabouts, as a "knocker.' 1 He
said he had made preparations to flee
immediately after meeting Missett. but
was detained by an attack of cramps.
HÂ« vigorously denied having offered De
tective Arnold $40,000 or "even 40 cents."
as he put It.
Eisenman, to whom he intrusted ' the
bundle containing $9500. also came In for
a scoring from CunJinTe, who concluded
by remarking:
"Well, they can't hang m&." |

POPE PIUS TROUBLED
WITH A LIGHT COLD
False Rumor Is Circulated Abroad In
Rome That the Pontiff
Is 111.
ROME, Oct.- 22. â A rumor spread
through the city this morning: that the
Pope was 111. Dr.-Lapponl. his physi
cian, authorizes the press to announce
"the . statement is Inexact," the Pops
merely having- a cold, so slight that it
oould scarcely be called an Indisposi
tion. Since his last attack of gout In
January, his Holiness, the doctor said,
had enjoyed perfect health.
To-day the Pope received more than
200 persons. The fact* that these audi
ences have not been suspended Is the
best evidence of the Pope's good health.

TRADE AGAIN IRREGULAR.
THE distinctive feature of trade last week was the sudden fall
ing off of the business of the city of New York, which, as in
dicated by the bank clearings, showed a decrease from the corre
sponding week in 1904 of 3.4 per cent.- This sharp loss brought the
record for the whole country down to a trivial gain over 1904 of
only 1.3 per cent, by far the smallest for a long time. Just what
this means is not yet apparent. It can hardly be due to a falling off
in stock speculation, for that has remained about, the same .in vol
ume for some weeks, hence the natural inference is that the loss
must be charged up to business in general.
The record for the whole country, however, was fully up to
the recent exhibit as far as individual cities and towns were con
cerned, for the aggregate clearings amounted to $2,787,689,000,
while the only important cities besides New York to show a loss
were St. Louis and New Orleans. But it is noteworthy that all the
gains of these other cities were much smaller than heretofore this
year, and were insufficient to offset the loss in New York. The log
ical conclusion, therefore, is that the country at large is not doing
the business that it has been doing for a year past. The failures,
too, again showed an increase over 1904, being 233, against 215 in
But against this rather unfavorable exhibit is the extraordinary
demand by the great railroads for increased rolling stock to meet
the expanded internal traffic of the country. It has just been an
nounced that the Pennsylvania Railroad has placed orders for 21.500
more cars, in addition to 16,160 ordered in August. These railroad
orders have practically pre-empted all steel car-building facilities for
the year 1906. In fact, the car-building companies all over the coun
try are so crowded with orders that they cannot fill them, one com
pany alone having unfilled contracts for 60,000 cars.
These orders for cars and locomotives break all previous rec
ords, and do not indicate any falling off in the movement of mer
chandise, but rather a large increase. The exhibits of the locomo
tive and car works, and those of the failures and bank clearings,
therefore, are paradoxical and somewhat confusing. The only ready
explanation is that business in general has slackened throughout the
country, but that the immense crops of wheat, corn and other grains,
and cotton demand for their transportation to market more rolling
stock than the railroads now possess.
But if the crops are so heavy the business of the country will
naturally be proportionately large, as the farming element will re
ceive enormous returns froiti the crops, and its already great pur
chasing power be continued for at least another year. It is this con
dition that maintains the current confidence and optimism up to
their high plane. Everybody banks on the crops. The financiers
base their operations upon them. Wall street is daily bawling them
through its might}- megaphone and the merchants in city and coun
try are buying more goods and extending their credits upon them.
"Give us the large crops and the current wave of prosperity will
continue." they all say. Very well â we have the big crops.
The money market is coming to the support of the enthusiasts.
When the interest rates advanced so sharply in New York a fort
night ago, the leading financiers immediately sent out circulars stat
ing that high money would rule the rest of the year. But money is
a perverse thing. It does not always do what one thinks it will.
Instead of the .rates ruling high, the flurry was shortlived and the
rates have been falling irregularly ever since, getting down to 3@
4V4 per cent on Friday, with the tendency downward at the close.
Stocks, meanwhile, have remained about stationary, the daily fluc
tuations being narrow and of an individual rather than a general
character, while trading has been light and largely professional.
As far as the staples are concerned, there have been no radical
changes during the week. Dry goods have been rather quiet, though
the action of the Fall River manufacturers in advancing wages indi
cates increasing activity and profits in this important line. Some
slackening in the demand for corn, hog products, general provisions,
raw silk and some other necessaries and luxuries is noted, but hides
and leather are stiff and shoes were advanced 50 cents per pair on
many grades at Chicago during the week. The distributive trade is
showing some irregularity, being excellent in some sections and
only fair in others. No complaints of collections are heard, and
prices for the different farm products are still above the normal,
with the farmers all ofer the country in good financial condition and
generally indisposed to sell their products except at top market
\ All these conditions show more irregularity in general trade.
Many of them contradict each other, as has been shown. Evidently
business is less uniform than it has been. Whether -this tendency
will become more pronounced or soon cease to exist, as has been
the rule for half a dozen years, when the occasional lulls have
proved shortlived and resulted in more activity later on, remains to
be seen. :: i .V^fc
ASSESSED WEALTH OF THE STATE.
WE have published the Controller's statement of the assessed
property values of the State for the purposes of taxation.
The amount is $1,624,991,742. Of this there is, in the three
counties of San Francisco, Alameda and Los Angeles, $873,639,994,
or over one-half. More than half the wealth of California is con
centrated in these three counties. The total State and county rate
of taxation in each is, in Alameda, $1.80; in San Francisco, $1,654;
in Los Angeles, $1.70. This seems to vindicate the consolidation of
city and county government, since the largest and wealthiest of
the three, San Francisco, with such consolidation, has the lowest
tax rate. The highest rate in the State is Yuba, with $2.90 on the
$100. Perhaps there is a special reason for this, in the maintenance
"of levees against floods in the Bear and Feather rivers. The lowest
rate in the State is Si. 55, paid by Contra Costa, Modoc, Sutter and
Yolo.
The total assessed value of railroads is $69,820,186. Of that
Los Angeles has -the most, $5,389,415, and San Bernardino the next,
$5,191,891. It is a surprise that Fresno has. $3,836,267. Of course
San Francisco has but little, only $161,111, for the mileage is small.
The table is an interesting study. If_the proposition of the
Â£tate Grange to divide the objects of State taxation from those sub
ject to local tax prevail, as it ought, the railroad assessment of the
State, when reinforced by State licenses and other corporate prop
erty, furnishes a fine basis for the total State revenue.
Of course the assessed valuation of the State does not repre
sent its total wealth by a large percentage. . This is due to causes
well known to assessors, and to the failure to include all the per
sonal property of the State. Under a more enlightened revenue
system the valuation would be twice what it is and the rate would be,
only half as large. The result to the taxpayer would be the same,
but the showing would more nearly do justice to the State's re-

In view of Mrs. Mills' many English af

she should act as his hostess during his

IF you do the thing that you wish,

When our books are closed and our

What credit for ac and you?
Why, I sometimes tnlnk that .the gods
; must> grin, -
And their merriment never tire.
As they say, "He fancied a prize to win
By seeking his heart's desire!"
But here Is a tale of a soul I knew
That buried Its dreams, its duty to do.
A plodding little woman of a plodding
'\u25a0' _ % little way.
Yet mem'ry holds her fairer than the
. . daughters of the day.
I And though you missed in her for aye
the beauty I have seen.
More regal she in calico than any
i earthly aueen.
Into her. hard and toilsome life came
dreams of art and grace.
; But she buried all her visions with a
â¢ sweetly smiling faceâ
Of castle, dome and minaret in lands
where favored roam â
As she turned to humble duties in her
humble little home.
AH dreams of beauty unexpressed her
, secret longing knew.
She buried, ever smiling, that she
. " might her duty do.
The great suns shed their roses in
crimson o'er the West.
And their dying glory thrilled her,
but the nurslings in her nest
Were calling still for "mother," so she
\u25a0i turned where skies were gray.
Just to do her plodding duty in her
plodding little way.
Clad in her homely garments, with
; on her face.
I know quite well you ne'er had seen
her beauty and her grace;
But even as she still refused her ar
tist-nature's plea.
She sung the lullaby of love to bairns
about her knee:
And as she sung her sweet face shone;
- 'the song was like a prayer â
No Princess on this rounded earth was
ever half so fair.
She was your mother? Nay, but mine,
or haply mine and yours.
For still such women â God be thanked!
â are found while life endures.
In homely little homes they go their
homely little way.
And oft-the "line of beauty", miss, and
oft are worn and gray:
They bury many a vision fair 'mid
homely, sordid scenes.
But from .the dust of perished hopes
they rise, our fairest queens:
We meet them here and pass them by
and, "Commonplace!" we say.
For we are blind and ever blind, upon
our earthly way.
But we, whose . baby feet they led to
paths, the best we trace,
Smile through a rain of loving tears at
memory of their grace.
If you do the thing that you wish, my
friend.
And the thing that I wish I do.
When our .books are closed and our ledg
ers end.
What credit for me and you?
But here are the ones "that "count," I
know.
The ones that their duty do,
Though their dreams are dead and their
hopes lie low,
And their ashes their sweet lives
strew â
And If you doubt there are lives like
. these.

WHY ARAMINTA WAS DISPLEASED.
"I do not think â " said Araminta.
"I've noticed it," her fair- friend re
marked.-
"As I was about to say when you so
rudely interrupted me," Araminta con
tinued. "I do not think that' a man has
any right to attempt to kiss a girl
against her will."
"Her lips would be better, I should sup
pose." her, friend murmured.
"You shock, me," said Araminta, - "but
as I was about to say, if he docs attempt
It he is a wooden chump if he does not
succeed." .. *
"I think so, too," her friend gurgled.
"And between ourselves," Araminta
concluded, as a coy blush resolutely
mounted to her maiden cheek, "that Is
why I refuse to have anything more to
do with young Dumleigh."
"You have done just right," said her
friend.
Then they began to discuss the fall
A LITTLE PARABLE.
Hatred and Selfishness fell in love with
each other because they saw that their
deeds were alike evil.
\u25a0 So they sought Beelzebub, and asked
him to marry them.
"I will, do It," he said, "but it must be
on one condition." .
"What is the condition?" they asked.
"That the two of you, then legally made
one, shall take a new name."
"It. is agreed," they'said.
So they were wedded with much pomp
and ceremony. â¢
"Now. what is our new name?" they
Immediately Inquired.
"Human Folly," was the answer. "That
name hereafter will Include the both of
you, as, indeed, it practically, has done
heretofore."
So the united two wander over the
earth, covering it with unhappiness and
frequently we refer to them by their
former names, but not the less does their
wedded name apply to either or both of
them. .

A BE'i ./EEN SEASONS STREET COSTUME.
THE school girl, with the hard wear that Is entailed upon her clothes
at all times, finds the need of a between seasons street costume fully
as imperative as does her mother, if indeed not more so. This simple
but effective design. 'in a rather heavy quality sicilienne. has a clever
touch of velvet at collar and cuff, the ceinture likewise of the same
flattering material. The little coat follows loose Eton lines, standing
well away from the figure, and hanging loosely above the belt. This
item is separate from both coat and skirt, strongly featherboned at
front, back and sides, so that It serves to support the Immature figure
well. A touch of style is added to the full sleeve in the upturned flar
ing cuff of velvet that appears above the wrist. The skirt has &
gored upper part, the fitting over the hips acompllshed by means of
darts that are run on the outside of the skirt, and add to Its smart
apearance. A shaped Spanish flounce Is applied halfway below the
knee, inverted pleats appearing at intervals and adding to the fulness.
Laughter Is the Thing.
Angela Morgan
LAUGHTER'S the thing. To be
fashionable nowadays one should
cultivate cheery smiles and fre- |
quently indulge In that health
stimulating expression of mirth known
as a laugh.
This is the latest dictum of London's
smart set, and it is declared that the
medical fraternity indorse the fad as
most beneficial to one's health and gen
eral well-being. .
Not only is'the indulgence in open
cheerfulness regarded as an aid to
health, but it is pronounced far more
efficacious in making women beautiful
than lotions and powders and dyes.
As a result the women of London are
spending less time before the toilet
table and devoting more to the cultiva
tion of smiles and cheerfulness.
Accustomed though we are to ridicule
fads, let us , be glad of this one and
pray it may become universal; not as
an affectation, but as a steady habit, a
genuine practice of cheer. For surely
. nothing could have a more salutary
effect upon the race than the continued
habit of happiness.
This is getting at the core of health.
This is getting at the soul of beauty.
Health does not long remain Â« health
unless fed by springs of gladness within.
Beauty is not beauty that is unil
lumined by the flame of an inner joy.
-The adoption of the cheer creed by
fashionable London is only one of the
innumerable indications that crowd
close upon one another to-day, showing
the swing of the world toward opti
mism and its recognition of mental
stone at a sinner. Perhaps, however,
it is because he (or she) realizes that he
is without sin.
Then, again, how can anybody be. cer
tain that he threw the first stone? As
likely aa not. some other fellow shied
a stone at some 'previous time.
I knew a man who said we should not
be too charitable, and I am free to say
that he was not. He didn't seem very
lonely, either.
Some people who cry in church, "Lord,
be merciful to me. a sinner." appear to
be mightily anxious to give the Lord an
opportunity to continue being merciful.
The "dying thief upon the cross" was
forgiven, but the fact does not justify
anybody in endeavoring to live so as to
be forgiven In that way.
I am middling loud in condemning thosÂ«
who have been convicted of their of
fenses, but I want to extend a hand of
fellowship to those who have not been
caught at it.

Humanity Is beginning to see that
pessimism does not pay. Time was

as an indication of superior brains,
of uncommon reasoning faculties. It

clever to be bored and tired of life.

promote our health.
The new psychology Is demonstrating
that pessimism, gloom, despondency,
fear, are poisonous fn their effects upon

one finds a veritable storage battery of

No matter how blue you may feel: how

Smile! Don't wait to feel like smiling
before you make an effort. Smile any
way! Get your lips into an upward curve
and keep them there. Create the habit.
After a while you'll begin to find rea
sons for smiling. It's a law. Be cheer
ful and you'll start all the cheer vibra

about you.
Find something every day to laugh
about. And when you laugh, laugh hear

Smiles and laughter are auto-sugges

A HIT.
What Sbe Gained by Trj lnc Aeain.
A failure at first makes us esteem final
success.
A family in Minn, that now enjoys
Postum would never have known how
good it Is if the mother had been dis-
couraged by the failure of her first at-
tempt to prepare it. Her son tells the
etory: ;
"We had never used Postum food cof-
fee till last spring (a year ago), when
father brought home a package one even-
ing Just to try it. We had heard from
our neighbors, and in fact every one who
used it, how well they liked it, and that
besides taking the place of coffee as a
beverage it furnished a most nutritious
and healthful article of food. So we
were going to give It a trial.
"Well, the next morning mother brew-
ed It about 5 minutes, just as she had
been in the habit of doing with the other
coffee, preparing it, I fear, without pay-
ing special attention to the directions
printed on the package. It looked weak
and didn't have a very promising color,
but nevertheless father raised his cup
with an air of expectancy. It certainly
did give him a great surprise, but I'm
afraid it wasn't a very pleasant one, for
he put down his cup with a look of dis-
gust, and said. 'Mother, are you sure this
Isn't your dish water?'
"Mother wasn't discouraged though,
and next morning gave it another trial,
letting it stand on the stove till boiling
began and then letting It boil for fifteen
or twenty minutes, and this time we
were all so pleased with It that we have
used it ever since, and though we had a
quantity of the old coffee in the bouse. 1
fear it will all be spoiled before we can
get it used up.
"Father waa a confirmed dyspeptic and
a cup of coffee is to him like poison. So
he never drinks it any more, but drinks
Poetum regularly. He isn't troubled
with dyspepsia any more, and is actually
growing fat, and I'm sure Postum is the
cause of it. AH the children are allowed
to drink It and they are perfect pictures
of health." Name gU'en by Postum Co.,

LAURA BRIDE POWERS
The restoration of the famou3 old; Mi
ssion of San Antonio in Monterey Countyâ
the most valuable and picturesque posses
sion of Northern Californiaâ is now prac
tically assured. The ancient adobe walls,
rebuilt and safeguarded last year by the
Landmarks League, * will soon enjoy the
luxury of a roof, and the beautiful old
sanctuary will have thus been saved to
our children's children as a heritage of
a picturesque past, and a heritage that is
not measured by sentiment and ehthu- 1
siasm alone, but by the latter-day stand
ard of dollars and cents.
Speaking commercially, every old mis
sion saved from disintegration in Cali
fornia is an asset of the State and of the
nation. The historic old spots are a sourca
of infinite interest to 60,000 tourists who
annually visit the State, arid furnish the
traveling folk with an inexhaustible
amount of romance and history while
wandering about. With a passing of these
old missionsâ unquestionably the most In
teresting helrlcoms, not only of Califor
nia, but of Americaâ a financial less to
the State will be sustained that wlil hit
hard after the harm is done. And as the
loss to" the State from the standpoint of
art, architecture, poetry, idealism, history I
and romance, there is no"' gauge by which
such a deprivation can be measured. j
With these truths fixed in their minds, '
the Daughters of California Pioneers are |
patriotically doing their .. part to help)
save one old missionâ San Antonio de
Padua, the most important structure of
its time north of Santa Barbara, save San
Juan Bautiste and Mission Dolores, both
of which are in a fair state of preserva
tion.
To-morrow night, at Pioneer Hall, fit
rendezvous for such a purpose, the
Daughters have prepared a stunning pro
gramme of things to hear and things to
do.
Congressman Joseph R. Knowland will
present his lecture upon "California His
toric Landmarks," using by way of illus
tration 125 slides, including the San An
tonio Mission before " the Landmarks
League began its work of restoration; the
laborers at work upon the great adobe
walls, and the walls completed. Every
noted spot in the State has a place in the
collection, and it is a part of the educa
tion of every intelligent Callfornian to
familiarize himself with them, and the
story that is woven round them.
Following Mr. Knowland, Mrs. Kathryn
Hilke, the famous New York soloist, will
give some of the songs that won her
fame in Gotham: and latterly the Pre
sidio band will play for dancing.
Under the leadership of Mrs. E. P.
Schell a whist and' a 500 tournament will
be conducted in the reception room, with
a band of pretty girls to scoreâand-inci
dentally some mighty pretty prizes to
capture.
And if you don't dance, and you don't
play cards, perhaps you smoke. For such
as you there will be a cozy corner, with
comfy chairs- and good cigars, and a
bowl of punch just over the way.
For these allurements the price of ad
mission is fifty centsâ and no further tax
is levied, lest you need a smoke or sigh
for a drink.
Tickets are on sale at Sherman &
Clay's, and at the door to-morrow
night and give yourself up to the pleas
or business cares, . lay them by for the
night and give yourself up to the pleas
ant relaxation offered by the patriotic
Daughters. ,
Besides, you will thus have proved your
patriotism to bo more than "as hollow
brass and a sounding cymbal."

Quite the biggest thing in clubdom
during the week was the suffrage con
vention that adjourned on Saturday.
Re.ports read proved that the State
is awakening to the injustice of tax
ing a part of its people without di
rect representation â that "Taxation
without representation was tyranny In
1776; taxation without representation
is tyranny in 1905."
It wouldn't make nice reading for
tho legislators who vetoed the suffrage
bill at Sacramento to hear the com
ments upon them, their intelligence
and their motives. And it might in
terest thorn to know that .the leaders
cf the cause have preserved the names
of tho men who voted "nay" â who con
fessed themselves afraid to present the
right of equal suffrage before the peo
ple because they were afraid the cause
would win.
Afraid?
Yes. The possession of the ballot by
women is feared by the gangsters,
boodlers and grog-shop keepers. Eight
thousand clubwomen in San Francisco
are known to stand behind the high
license movement now being agitated,
and if those 8000 women could cast a
ballot according to their convictions
the lesser grog shops would go to the
wall, and that wouldn't be relished by
a large part of the voting constit
uency.
But nevertheless In the fullness of
time It will come, for the biggest men
In the. country are open advocates of
the cause from the President of the
United States and the Governor of the
State down the line. But these men
have nothing to fear â It Is different
with the others.
The California Club has put Itself on
record Â»as the most useful club in San
Francisco. It has accomplisher much for
civic betterment, for education, within
and without Its confines, and has made
itself a factor in the activities of the
city.
It Is now pursuing a well-denned policy
of education, -presenting a series of lec
ures by men famous in these lines be
yond the Rockies.
- The first of these will be given in the
new auditorium of the California Club
on Wednesday evening, by Charles Zueb-
Un, Ph. 8., B. D., on "The New Civic

TO PURCHASE ANCIENT AVAR
FOR DISPLAY PURPOSES
Huntlngton Road Considers Proposition
of. Securing Old AVar Vessel '
From Chinese Government.
The section of the Huntington rail
road that runs between Los Angeles
and Long Beach may, purchase from the
Chinese Government an old fashioned
Chinese war junk for exhibition pur
poses along the Pacific Coast. M. W.
Milne, who left yesterday for Los An
geles, will soon depart for the Orient
to secure the ancient man-of-war. The
railroad intends to make the craft an'
attraction at Long Beach and it will
probably be taken to other Pacific
Coast ports.
Milne figures that the Chinese Gov
ernment will ask $17,000 for the craft,
\u25a0which means that It will probably be
bought for $2000 after considerable
haggling. The vessel has already been
selected and will be brought here un
der-her own sail.
The junk is. made of teakwood, is
180 feet long, and has the typical low
stern and high prow of the style that
has existed in China for two hundred
years. Her sails are made of fine bam
boo, and she Is elabdrately decorated
with the Indispensable .eyes painted at
her bow with which to see her way.
The Chinesecrew will be selected here
with which to man the ship and train
the old muzzle loading guns. They will
also be useful In explaining the various
Chinese arms and strange devices. A
curio shop will be established on board,
where purchases of Chinese knick
knacks may be made by visiting tour
ists.

cab horse, may from time to time bo
bought at TattersaH'p. and the auc
tioneer has a hammer which is said to
have knocked down over Â£1,000,000
worth of horses.
There was much that wai romantic
about the beginning: of Tattersall's
nearly a century and a half ago. In
1766 a certain Richard Tattersall. a
Yorkshire wool comber, who had lost
his fortune during the Jacobite rebel
lion, obtained a ninety-nine years' lease
from Lord Grosvenor, one of the ances
tors of the present Duke of Westmin
ster, of a p!at of land near to St.
George"3 Hospital, where he built an
establishment for the sale of horses and
hounds.
Tattersall had many influential con
nections, and was on friendly terms
with the Prince Regent, Lord Boling
broke, and others, whose patronage
and good word greatly helped to make
his business a huge success from the
beginning. Such was the friendship
between him and the Prince that the
bust of George IV on the top of the
fountain in the present sale yard was
placed In the original yard at the
Prince's own recuest.
The Prince constantly sat at Tatter
sail's table, and such was the horse
vender's deference on these occasions
that, notwithstanding the Prince's pro
tests, he always refused to sit down
at the table until the arrival of. the
port. However. It is said that when
driving- back to Newmarket after one
of these functions, when the post-boys
had had too much to drink, the Prince
and a friend would ride postilion with
Tattersall and a guest inside.
In due course a huge Blice of luck
came the way of Tattersall. Lord Bo
lingbroke fell heavily into his debt,
and by way of settlement passed on to
Tattersall his famous racer Highflyer,
which became the father of three Der
by winners, and whose progeny in
eighteen years won races to the value
of no less than Â£100,000 on one race
there, and it was said that it was quite
a common thing for that amount to
change hands on one of the settling
days at "Old Tatt's," or "The Corner."
as the place was variously called.
All classes of sdciety frequented it,
and dukes and stable-boys were mixed
together in the excited crowd, all of
them prepared to bet on anything and
everything. The state of affairs be
came such that eventually, when the
lease expired, the Marqufs of Westmin
ster declined to grant a renewal of it,
and the firm moved to Its present hand
some premises at Albert Gate, where
no betting is now carried on.
Nowadays Tattersall's maintains its
reputation chiefly- by the enormous
prices that are occasionally obtained
there for celebrated racehorses. It was
at Tattersall's that Flying Fox was sold
to a French owner for 37,500 guineas,
and Ormonde to an American for 30,000
guineas. Here also Sceptre, as a year
ling, was sold for 10,000 guineas, La
Fleche for 12,600 guineas, and Blair
Athol for only 100 guineas less.
A feature of Tattersall's is the oc*
casional sales of .yearlings or little
baby racehorses, those of high-class
parentage often fetching four or five
thousand guineas, although they prove
such distressing failures that they fin
ish up as common hack or cab horsee. â

POLECATS CLOSE SCHOOL
TO DISMAY OF TEACHERS
Boys Stoned Them In Basement, Then
Retired tor Necessary-
Repairs.
Polecats put the entire Murray School
to rout this week, forcing it to close down
for two days until the rooms, were hab
itable.
The boys discovered a polecat with two
kittens in the basement of the school
house. The animals were stoned, but
offered no resistance until one of the
young was made captive. Then the pole
cats opened warfare. Within a few mo
ments the boys were put to flight, and
most of them hurried home, where their
clothing was quickly removed and buried.
The parents took the children in hand and
bathed them in disinfectants.
Soon aiter the polecats began defending
themselves the effects were noticeable in
the two schoolrooms above. So sudden
and offensive was it that school was im
mediately adjourned, the teachers fleeing
with the pupils.
So penetrating was the odor that sev
eral girls fainted before they could reach
the doors, and it was necessary to carry
them outside. The building has been
thoroughly fumigated during the enforced
vacation. All three polecats were killed.

DELAXEY IXDIGXAXT WHEX
KAUPJIAJfX IS- MISQUOTED
Veteran Manager Denies Story to the
a Effect that Vouneater Is n
Ulowhard.
The sporting public was doubtless
dumfounded yesterday morning in
reading a statement in a local paper
to the effect that Al Kaufmann stated
he could mow Hart down in two' rounds
and also figured on beating Jeffries.
The article proved to be the rankest
kind of a fake, as proven by a letter
from Billy Delaney, Kauf manh's man
ager.
Delaney has always made It a point
to restrain his charges from doing any
unnecessary talking, and those who
know him felt sure he would not allow
Kaufmann to start out as a blowhard
before he had a chance to display his
ability against a first-claSs man. Fol
lowing is a copy of Delaney's letter:
ALAMEDA. Oct. 22.
Sporting Editor Callâ Dear Sir: A San
Francisco paper quoted Al Kaufmann as saying
among other things, that llarvln Hart would
be a pushover for him and that he would not
last as long as Jack Monroe lasted with Jef
fries; also quotes him as saying he is going to
try to get a match on with Jeffries. Those
thatâ know Kaufmann know that he would
never make such a talk as that. In fact, he
never claimed he could beat anybody, nor did
he or myself ever say he would be the next
champion. Ha would be a blowhard to speak
that way about Marvin Hart and a coward to
talk about fighting Jeffries at this stage of the
game. At present he has fight enough on his
hands without talking about beating Marvin
Hart or fighting Jim Jeffries, who, by the way,
could beat O'Brien, Kaufmann and Hart In
the same ring, and no one knows this better
than Al Kaufmann. Yours,
BILLY DELANEY.

Missouri Great for Frogs.
The United States Fish Commission
has begun an investigation concerning
the best method to propagate frogs.
For years Inquiries from all parts of
the country have kept coming In for
Information on how to ral3e frogs for
market, and so it was decided to ap
point experts. to study frog propagation.
As soon as the experts can- obtain a
reasonable amount of material thescom
mission will issue a bulletin on^ow to
operate a frog farm.
The principal, market for frog legs In
this country is found in New York City,
where in Fulton Market alone, from
75,000 to 100,000 pounds of frogs' legs
are sold annually. The information al
ready obtained, by the experts shows
Missouri to be the greatest : frog pro
ducer in the United States. ; The ex
perts will confine their ; labors , mainly
to the swamp lands of Arkansas and
Missouri, which are reported -to be the'
finest frog growing areas on the con
tinent. . :
Anglers for black bass, pickerel,
perch and muskellunge are also great
ly interested In* Uncle Sam's new work
owing to I frogs having . been found to be \u25a0
the best bait for . catching the Vfish

lies in the fact that the winner may be
the champion heavyweight' of the world

* "Philadelphia" Jack played to a
crowded house at his ocean beach
training- " quarters yesterday and those
who were lucky enough to get into the
little gymnasium saw the shifty East
erner at his best. He punched the bag
and went through a course of work on
the pulling machine that brought a
round of applause from the big crowd.
After this a whirl at the heavy swing
ing-bag was done and. he hit with his
hands, elbows and shoulders, excellent
exercise for a fellow preparing -for a
hard battle. O'Brien then went through
about ten minutes at shadow sparring
and he gave an exhibition of foot work
at this exercise that has never before
been seen in this neighborhood. .This
was followed by three rounds of box
ing with Joe Gorman. \u25a0
Kauf mann did no work at his Alameda

pointed, although Billy Delaney took
pains to announce that he would lay

MANY OLYMPIANS ENJOY
A CHOSS COUNTRY RUN
Member* of the Winsed O 'Tramp
Over the Hills to El
Campo. "
Seventy members of the Olympic Club
participated in the monthly cross coun
try run yesterday, starting from their
boathouse at Belvedere at 9 o'clock a.
m. Headed by their captain, Max L.
Rosenfeld, they set off at a merry clip,
through Tiburon and over % the Bay
Shore road beyond El Campo. The run
soon developed into a long distance
race, and the athletes wearing the
winged O were soon stringing out in
single file along the hilly road. At El
Campo a halt was called to give the
stragglers a chance" to catch up and the
return route over the hills soon showed
that the club was developing among the
younger members a fine set of long
distance runners.
'Returning to their boathouse the
athletes donned their bathing suits and
indulged in a swim in the. bay. A splen
did luncheon was served at the Hotel
Belvedere, where mine host Allen
spread himself to give the athletes a
good time. After luncheon speeches
were made, good stories told and popu
lar songs taken up by the boys and all
started back for the city feeling that
they had passed a splendid day and en
joyed an invigorating outing.
In the evening the leading members
of the outdoor set were entertained at
dinner by Al Coney, an enthusiastic
member of the club and founder of the
branch known as the Dipsea Indians.

SURGEONS MAKING USE
OF THE BLUE ' LIGHT
Doctors of Geneva Pronounce It Valu
able na an Anesthetic. '\u25a0'â¢"{
A rather new use of blue light has been
reported from Genevaâ namely, its use as
an anesthetic in dentistry. In the course
of some. experiments to ascertain the ef
fects of light of different colors upon the
nerves professors Redard and: "Emery
found that blue light was very soothing.
The somewhat remarkable . statement is
made that a sixteen-candle-power blue
light, directed upon the eyes of a patient
for three minutes, caused him to lose sen
sitiveness to such an extent that a' tooth
was painlessly extracted, without after
effects of any kind. "Whether the anes
tesia was general or only local is not re
ported.
It is probable that had General Pleas
anton been a true scientist and a skillful
experimentalist he might have made some
discoveries of value to the world, for, as
Dr. Finsen himself has said, "The general
was on the right track." In 1877 Pleas
anton published a book with the following
explanatory title, "The j Influence of the
Blue Ray of the Sunlight and of the Blue
Color of the Sky in Developing Animal
and Vegetable Life, in Arresting Disease
and in Restoring Health in' Acute and
Chronic Disorders to Human and Domes
tic Animals, as Illustrated" by thÂ« Experi
ments of General A. J. Pleasanton and
Others, Between the Years 1861 and 1876."
The book is printed on blue paper and
abounds in fallacious and dogmatic state
ments. One of his dicta is, "Light is the
great source of terrestrial electricity,
magnetism and heat "> QuitÂ© a large por
tion of the book is devoted to testimonials
from physicians and various others * re
lating to the efficacy of the blue-ray
treatment , in cases of general ill | health,
rheumatism, etc. Pleasantonâ believed
that the results claimed by him were due
to I the "Juxtaposition of | plain uncolored

Tta seldom, indeed, that Papa Van Hal-
Lrett'A flo^k of Commuters play the game
as they did against the Siwashes yester
day afternoon at the Eiphth-Ptreet lot.
y.cery man on the payroll made a DoiM
. 'ike a ballplayer and never for a mo
\u25a0'i*Mit did the northern hosts figure. In
yr;t. they did not corae within whistling
/.-"\u25a0lance of the pan. though they got one
i.-jore hit than the Oakland brigade.
Every fan who watched the perform
:mce was positive all the Oaklanders were
â¢l^roes. but Brick Devereaux and Ham
ibcrg were in a class higher. Bill earned
hie title with a two-cushion swipe with
a couple of men waiting to come in and
Ham was great because he pitched shut-r
out ball.
The game sparkled with startling in
cidents and quick, enappy plays which
tended to make the fans like it. Only
x.n hour and twenty minutes were re
quired to rip oft the nine spasms. Neither
I berg nor Vickers gave away any free
parses and outside the booting tactics
of Bennett the 'contest came pretty near
bticg a perfect exhibition, as far as the
error column cut In.
If a man begins to boot a ball you
. never can tell when he is due to stop.
Benaett was afflicted with an attack of
the jimmies yesterday and to him the
Commuters may give thanks for victory.
In the fourth, after Moskiman had hit to
right with two in the cellar. Bennett
fumbled Hogan's grounder and Bill Dev
ereaux immediately became a great man
by clouting out to the flagpole for two
sacks. Bill was restless and slid into
third on the next ball pitched. Blank
enship heaved the ball wide and the
brinrtle one immediately tore in with an
other run.
The game progressed very smoothly
and without accident or incident till Julie
Streib made a comic-opera stop of Iberg's
? rounder and got his man at first in the
making the second down. Then
Bennett got bad again and let Kruger's
gcuunder get away after Van Haltren
had hit and pulled up at second on Kane's
fumble. Kruger stole and when Dun-
Icavy whisked a hot one to the right
garden both men came tearing through,
swelling Oakland's grand total to five
for the afternoon.
Beginning to-morrow there will be
cames at Recreation Park every Tues
Â«lay afternoon. For the balance of the
season Oakland will play on its home
grounds every day except Monday. There
will be Sunday-morning games both
here and across ihe bay hereafter. The
score:

FAVORITES FAIL
TO SHOW CLASS
Talent Gets a Knockout Blow
During* the Last Few Days
of the Jamaica Meeting
GOOD CARD FOE TO-DAY
High-Class Fields Are Carded
to Eun in the 'Lynbrook
and Two Short Handicaps
Â£l ecitl Dispatch to The Call.
NEW -YORK, Oct. 22.â Although favor
ites have been sufficiently disappointing
of late at Jamaica to affect the attend
ance at any racetrack, the extra good
card offered to-morrow will help matters
and many bright prospects are held out.
The Lynbrook and two handicaps have
high class fields anu with good horses
there is no excuse for failure to run to
form.
Although iuonacodor ran a dull ' race
last time, his chances in the handicap at
six furlongs cannot be denied. Only 88
pounds^ to carry is truly a leather for
him, Snd if he gets a good ride he should
! never give up tne lead.
As Zienap ran "a really improved race
last time, she seems to nave a grand
chance in '"the Lynbrook., She showed
more speed in her race on ' Saturday, and
her second to Tiptoe some time ago is
still fresh In our memories.- She might
even have beaten Tiptoe in that race had
she met with clear sailing. Inquisitor,
with 103 pounds up. should be the con
tender.
Ormonde's Right has too much class for
his opponents in the last race and he
should bo able to handle them any way
he chooses. He can gallop along behind
them to the stretch and then come away,
01 he can make his own running and
there is not one of them that can take
the track away from him. Jocund ran a
fair race with an apprentice boy up last
time, so if Shaw rides he shgu.- get the

SACRAWENTO BOY
IN FRONT AGAIN
Veteran Dog* Shows Old Form
by Defeating Homer Boy
in Three Straight Kaces
Sacramento Boy sustained his repu
tation as the "honest greyhound" by
defeating Homer Boy in three succea- I
sive trials in the match races yesterday
at Inglesido Coursing Park before the <
largest crowd of the season. The, bet
ting wns nearly even on the three
courses, and severaL thousand dollars
were played, on both f dogs in each race.
The talent made Homer Boy a 2 to 3
favorite in the first course. The Sacra
mento delegation had plenty of money
to, play their favorite and they bet the
local contingent to a standstill at these
odds. -In. a long- sIJd Homer Boy
showed the way to the hare by a scant
length, but through slight favor
; Walsh's dog took the turn. In a rapid
i succession of turns Sacramento . Boy
j outworked his opponent.
I In the nÂ«xt course even money pre
vailed. This time the Sacramento dog
led and. proved the better worker. The
talent switched to Sacramento Boy In
the third trial and Installed him a 4
to 5 shot. Their judgment was sus-
I tamed, as the good old. dog led and beat
his opponent decisively. The winner
was roundly cheered as he was brought
off the field. . .

EDITED BY
R. A. SMYTH
Before the largest crowd ever gathered
about the park tennis courts, Charles
Foley, oC the Golden GatÂ© Tennis Club,
defeated Percy Murdock, of Alazneda,
yesterday in the finals of the second an
nual Bay Counties Championship tourna
ment. The best the Alamedan could do
was to win one set out of four. Foley'a
victory was In no sense a fluke, the local
boy outplaying his opponent from start
to finish. The score was 7-5, 8-2, 7-9. 6-L
In the opening set Murdock unfortu
nately broke his racquet. This undoubt
, edly affected his play, but not the out
come of the contest. Foley was much
steadier than Murdock and this Quality
accounts for his victory.
The first set was close and Murdock had
a splendid chance to win the last game of
the set. When it was 6-5 against' him.
Murdock had a lead of 40-0, but could not
win the point that would have made it
games all.
The third set was the closest and most
interesting of the four. After 5-5 had been
reached both contestants played, brilliant
tennis. At 6-5 Murdock led at 49-15, but
Foley got back everything and the Ala
medan lost the came.
Foley also won the next game, but Mur
dock took three In a row, giving him the
set. In the last game Murdock led at 40-0,
but Foley brought the score to deuce.
After having vantage half a dozen times
Murdock won the point on a clever volley.
After a seven-minute rest the fourth set
was commenced. Murdock started oft lik*
a winner. He passed his opponent thres
times In succession, taking the first
three points.
Foley. however, pulled out the gam<Â»
and from this time on the outcome was
I never In doubt.
At the conclusion of the match. Foley
received a great ovation from hla club
mates. H. .L. Tlckner presented the.
prizes' to the winner in singles. Foley
received the Lloyd challenge cup. which
was held by i>:ummond MacGavln, and
the first prize cup. Second prize went tv
Percy Murdock, and the two third prizes
to Clarence Griflln and Neil Baker. Fol
ey's victory was a popular one. as he 13
a modest chap and one who will wear his
laurels gracefully.
Only one match was played In doubles.
The contestants were the Baker broth
ers and Carl Gardner and Charles Dun
lap. After failing to win a game In the
first set, Gardner and Dunlap won the
next two easily. In the first set tha
Bakers, as usual, lobbed everything. In
the last two sets Gardner and Duc'.aj> re
sorted to the same style of play and beat
the brothers at their own game. The
score was <M, 6-1, S-2.
A round robin tournament will probably
be arranged between the four different
chainp!onsÂ« tc settle the question pÂ£ s:i
\u25a0\u25a0 premacy between them. Those who would
participate are Coast Champion Janes,
\u25a0 State Champion Adams, Bay Counties
Chtunpion Foley and San Francisco
I Champion Gardner.
3-1; Tlppecanoe beat lodine, 7-5: Little Plunger
beat Tne Old Peach. 8-3.
Third round â The Earl beat Peerless Beauty

took as the basis of his remarks the
words of the Prophet Amos, "Hate the
evil, love the good; and establish judg
; ment in the gate." He said in part:
This sermon needs no apology, thoutth it
calls for an explanation. The sentiment and
work urced by the prophet is .needed every
where and at all timrs. It is not partisan
among good people. We are passing through
a crisis In thÂ« history of San Francisco. Who
ever is :o blame, it is clear to sec that
\u25a0While the rabble with its thumb worn creeds,

Blt-Ci'S,.
Xo one can charge this pulpit with being
i aubservient to the rich or to the poor. Both
classes are ' in this chuich. and i' have not
j tailed to warn against- the selfish sreed of
\u25a0 the rich and the selnsh hate of the poor. And
I would have been spurned by these people
! as a coward had 1 not done so. . 'iV-jniKht 1
am to disc-u&s not political policies, but polit
; n-al righteousness. It It a duty I owe the
; public. Silence- would be . misunderstood at
thir time.
There are tome thines upon which we ate
i all aerefd. We all believe in civic fidelity.
j Faithtulneiw to our civic duties is demanded
' of alt. Without It our liberties will soon be
! come a myth, afcd we will be the dunes of
I demlcocuee and tyrants.
The weliare of the city Is even more im
i portant to the poor than to the rich. If the
j schools are poor the rich may sen^l their chil
i dren to private schools, .tout the poor must
i surter. If public sanitation is bad. the poor
I suffer most. Epidemics always are '*-orse in the
i sections of the cities where the pfor live, be
' cause sanitation is a matter of expense which
j the poor cannot provide for themselves. Neither
can they afford the necessary care in times
| of sickness which is always possible to wealth.
Bad officials are always of mor<! danKer to
' the Door than to the rich. The rich can buy
| their favor and they will not cease to plun-
UÂ«r the ix>or. - -i-.
If the court* are corrupt, justl:e is made
impossible to the poor. In our present crisis
there is no policy Involved. It is simply a
question of honesty and dishonesty, a choice
between the evil and the good. "Hate the
evil, love the good and establish Judgment
In the gate."
AHE NOT IN THE DARK.
What are we to expect of Mr. Sohmitz after
four years of public service? We are not in
the dark as to the policy and character of
his administration. Has he proved himself
worthy of our trust and our vote*? V c are
not here to pick flaws and to throw fire
brands, nor to engage In the use of language
which borders on slander. We simply call your
attention as thoughtful people to racts which
cannot be controverted. .
When Mr. Schmitz took his oath of office
four years ago. he had the indorsement of the
Methodist ministers of this city. In February.
1902 I was chairman of the Ministerial As
sociation. I welcomed the newly installed
Mayor to our platform, and he spoke words
which received the hearty Indorsement of all
present, and it was my privilege and duty to
extend to him our thanks. He spoke strong
words and we had great hope for the moral
welfare of the city. How has he fulfilled the
prophecy ot that address? Let me call atten
tion to the simple facts of the administra
tloa as an answer. . '
When the Ingleside "Job" was put through,
he utterly betrayed his trust knowingly. Every
moral element In the city protested against that
iniquity. The people several years before had
expressed their disapproval by ballot, and the
institution was kept closed through the veto
Â° We* Â»ad" every reason to believe that Mayor
Schmitz was on the side of morality and de
cency. But no one will ever forget, who was
present that day. when twelve, of the Board
of Supervisors, abetted by the Mayor, fell
down at the feet of the president of the
jockey club.
It was indeed a humiliating sight. And no
one interested in the welfare of our city will
ever TorÃet that this same Mayor, over the
petitions of the people, went Into a room alone
with that same president of the Jockey cluo
and signed the Iniquitous billâ a, bill that
produced -a most shocking reign of violation
of almost every command of the decalogue.
SVRRCVOER TO GAMBLING.
And I must not fcrget those who were re
sponsible with the Mayor for surrender to the
gambling element of our city.
When Mr. Brandensteln, as a member of the
Board of Supervisors, stated that we are not
the conservators of thÂ« -morals of the com
munity and voted for that bill, he surrendered
his right to the votes of moral pecple. For ;
that is neither good ! law nor good morals.
When the following men voted for that bill
they also forfeited their fight to cur fran
chises, viz: Alpers, Bent, Boxton, Braunhart,
Connors. Curtis, D'Ancona, Eggers, Loughery.
Lynch and Sanderson. â¢ And these men should
learn from the ballots of the people that they
do not always forjet.
Some time ago I epoke in this place on "Our
City's Shame." -It was at a time when the
administration was trying to fool the people
with Bpectacular reform. Wagonloads of
gamblers were carried through out city: later
Indecent penny arcades were raided and duly
advertised. But dlfl any one ever hear of the
conviction and punishment of these law break
ers? Two days were spent by a large number
of reputable citizens before* the Mayor's Po
lice Commission to stop tne licensing of more
ealoons on the boulevard. After the whole
question was examined the people were prom
ised' that no license sv-ould be granted. Later
It wm discovered that the man was allowed
to carry' on his place without a license for
three months and then without notice a li
cense was granted. ,
I* that what you call good government?
The actions of the Mayor and his boss dur
ing this campaign should turn every honest
man agalMt him. The attempt to place the
names of the party on the ballot three times
Is a trick' that a good man dare not lndors*.
The attempt for a man ! vrho !s notorious In
the management of the/Union Labor party to
walk Into the convention of another party and
try to control It in the interest of another party
Is demagoglsm that should be rebuked by an
honest citizen. The recent attempt to know
ingly violate the law of the State In placing
an amendment In an Illegal form !â¢ too atro
cious to receive the silent acquiescence O f any
decent man.
APPEALS TO LABOR UNIONS.
Do labor union men wish an administration
of such a man? Do labor union men wish It
to be understood that they wish their way so
badly that, they are .willing to countenance
such dishonesty? You must remember the man
who wlll.rjob your neighbor will rob you when
it 1Â« to his advantage to do so.
We have been placed in a dilemma by Mr.
Schmitz and hie advisors, r. We are forced to
the conclusion that he Is a knave, a hypocrite
-w a fool, any one of which disqualifies him
for our franchises.
Our only alternative Is Mr. Partridge. He
has not been a public official. But he is a
man irell known in' this city. We know the
manner of his life from a boy. We know
not what he Trill do. but we know what we
may expect of him.. His character is above
reproach. He* Is absolutely free from leading
! irtringE. Tbe fanner of his nomination makes
' him a free man. and we know that . the other
rran has allowed his hands to be tied. I ap
peal to you as American citizens, that you
sell not your liberties for the promise of Il
legal administration in your favor. I appeal
to you in the name of the American Federa
tion of Labor, do not tiÂ« your hands In favor
of this mess of potasre promised you by men
who hive tetrayed their public trust. Give
yourself in -abandonment to the right, and

CITIZENS FIRST;
THEN UNION MEN
Reverend A. C' Bane Declares
That Labor Organizations
Ought Not to Be in Politics
Rev. A. C. JBane, D. D., pastor of the
Howard Street Methodist Episcopal
Church, addressed his' congregation on
"The Relation of Labor Unions to Civic !
Righteousness In This Campaign." ) He
said that, labor unions had no right to
take up politics, and impressed upon the
, congregation that they must be; citizens .
j-flrst and union men afterwards. After the
i meeting many of the union men stated j
that they had changed their ideas in ;
regard to the unions and in the coming \
election they would vote for good \u25a0 gov- !
ernment.
During the course of his address the
Rev. Mr. Bane said in part:
My sympathies are with the toiler; hie in- \
teresta are mine. My church is made up of
toilers. My Ssvior was a toller. The true
' Christian is always on the side of the weak
I and jioor. â¢ \u25a0 ' !
Toilers have a right to form unions. I be
lieve labor unions have curbed .the sxlndlng
pewer of wealth and given better traces and
better hours to the laborer. In this 1 rejoice.
But remember - you are citizens first and
union men afterward. You should seek a good,
clean city government before you seek the po
litical advantage of jour union or your per
ponal advantage.
No man is a good citizen who encourage*
bad government, even though It puts money in
his pocket. Patriotism sinks personal Interests
for the public good. Won't your interests be
better served by an honest city government,
administered my men who won't offer nor
take a bribe than by an administration that
thrives on Â«raft?
HEIiP DEFEAT UNFAITHFUL.
\u25a0 You ought as good citizens for the % pubHc
good and for the tollera' good help defeat
men who have been unfaithful . to . the city,
and made ug a moral stench In the nostrils
of the decent world.
You union men are good citizens, but your
leaders are men the city can't trust. You
ouKiu to repudiate such leaders before the
people think you^are like them.
Where does the city's bOBs get his Interest
in the laborer? He 1b not one of you. He haa
nothing in common with you men who toil with
your hands. He is simply using you and the
unions for his personal gain. \u25a0
Labor unions are industrial organizations.
Your greatest mistake is going into politics.
That has made most of your enemies. The
American Federation of Labor and your most
conservative leaders oppose uniona going into
politics. It makes a clas9 fight. It arrays
men who toll against the men for whom they
toil. They pay you union wages and give you
union hours. Why shoi'M you set yourselves
against them in politics?
Labor and capital ought to be friends. You
are mutually dependent.
Candidates ought to be such that the em
ployer in his white shirt "and the laborer in
his blue overalls -xould go to the polls and
vote the same ticket for good government, and
you could in this city if the city's boss was
not making gain out of putting you into poli
tics and stirring up class hatred and strife.
For if there were no labor union party how
could Schmitz hold office end who would Ruc-f
boss? The old parties have cast them out.
DO NOT OPr-sE UNIONS.
But if you foolishly insist on having a party
and putting a class ticket in the field why
don't you select men in whom the people have
confidence? We do not oppose you. We do not
oppose labor unions. We oppose the men who
have misjrverned us and whom you have
chosen as your leaders. We would like to sup
port the laboring men, but we can't support
Mayor Ruef and his servant Schmitz.
I would oppose any man, combination or
i party that would undertake to injure the la
' boring man. I consider Schmitz and Ruef do
more to injure organized labor than any one
else in this city. If the Citizens' Alliance or
employers should organize an' employers' party
If the Citizens' Alliance under an assumed
name should undertake to injure the laboring
man. I would be the first man to oppose,. it as
contrary to the genius of American institutions
and as a breeder of etrlfe among those who
ought to be friends. But the Citizens' Alliance
is not running the fusion campaign. It is not
undertaking to injure labor in this fight. Mr.
Partridge does not represent the Citizens'. Al
liance. That is a false cry raised by the city's
toss to blind the laboring man to the real issue
graft â and make you laborers think your
unions will be destroyed If Partridge wins.
Partridge represents all classes of men and
trades, rich and poor alike, who want a clean
city. How could he Injure the toller? Could
he cut your wages or lengthen your hours or
prevent labor unions? No, it is nonsense. Mr.
Partridge. ! a poor man, honest and Just, will
be a better friend to you, controlling himself,
than will Mr. Schmitz, controlled by a selfish
political bo>;s.
While the present corrupt administration
is in power many capitalists refuse to invest
here. We can't sell our bonds for public im
provements. This works injury to the laborer,
for much of this money would go into 'your
pockets for honest toll. '
Can union men of families and Christian union
men support a man for Mayor who is supported
by all the low saloons, the gamblers, the ten
derloin, the thugs, the grafters, the boodlers
and hoodlums of the community? Ask your
selves why this crowd supports him. Is it not
because they are expecting favors from him?
Is not that bad company ror you? Schmitz is
the saloon candidate. They have indorsed him
ar.d work for him. That Is the best reason
why you should oppose him. The saloon is the
laboring man's worst enemy and eeems to be
Schmitz' s best friend.
Sai Francisco's reputation at home and
abroad Is bad. Rumors of scandal attach to
the administration. Immorality stalks abroad.
Crime seeme to> be encouraged and protected.
Who is responsible for the city's bad reputa
tion? .1 honestly believe it is, the man you.
have nominated for Mayor and the boss that
controls him.
I call on laboring men to help redeem our
city and restore .her good name, and throw
protection around your humble homes by voting
on November 7 for honest John Partridge.
GERMAN OFFICERS
AND CREW WORSHIP
Commandant Bahnke of the German
cruiser Falke and officers and crew wor^ 1
shlped yesterday morning at St. Markus
Lutheran Church, O'Farrell street, near
Frajiklln. They were escorted to the
church by the German Consul, F.Bopp,
and more than 100 members of the Ger

The church was crowded and the ser
vices, conducted by the Rev. Julius Fuen
delingr, the pastor, as usual followed close
ly the worship of the Evangelical
churches of Germany. :
As the visitors entered Johannes Raith,
the organist, played Bach's profound fuga
and the splendidly trained choir followed
with the hymn, "Thou Shepherd of Is
rael (BortnJansky), rendered without or
gan accompaniment. . '
Three of the most renowned German
hymns, "Come, Holy Spirit," "Put Your
rTrust in the Lord" and "Praise. the Lord,
ihe Mighty King of Glory," were taken up
by the full congregation..
The Rev. Fuendellng, during: his
sermon, said he felt Inclined to have a
plain, friendly, heart-to-heart talk with
his German brethren and cited the words
of Chancellor { Prince _ yon Buelow, who
had said: "The rising of, the new star in
the West was, alone welcomed at the' time
by Frederick the Great; and I wish as the

SCHMITZ SPEAKS
TO TEAMSTERS
Mayor Addresses Large Sun
day Afternoon Gathering
in Central Park Yesterday
Fully 2500 men and women gathered at
Central Park yesterday afternoon to hear
Mayor Schmitz and the other candidate of
the Union Labor party ticket discuss the
issues of the present campaign. The gath
ering was conducted under the auspices of
the International Brotherhood of Team
sters of San Francisco and was presided
over by Senator Frank Markey. George
Dillon was secretary. .
Mayor Schmitz discussed the questions
of the campaign along the lines which he
laid out in his first speech. He pointed
to the peace and prosperity of the past
four years and laid the credit at the feet
of the labor administration. He Insisted
that the coming election was a fight be
tween classes, claiming that the .Citizens'
Alliance was aligned against "the plain
people." He told of the organization of
the Union Labor party growing out of
the teamsters' strike and foretold a wage
earners' war and direful conditions should
the ticket bo defeated at the polls this
year. His estimate of his plurality was
20,000.
Carl' Browne, who marched with Cox
ey's army on Its wonderful journey to
Washington, was present at the .meeting
and drew off-hand sketches of prominent
public characters. He caused almost aa
much Interest as the Mayor's speech.
, The other speakers of the day were
Thomas Egan and George B. Benham. A
resolution condemning the Citizens' Al
liance and pledging the support of the In
ternational Brotherhood of Teamsters of
San â¢ Francisco to the Union Labor party
ticket was passed.

TO NAVAL OFFICER
Key. Evaiis Eesents Kude
Treatment of Captain
MaJian.
"Trafalgar day" was observed at
Grace Church, California and Stockton
streets, yesterday evening when the
Rev. David Evans, the rector, preached
on the significance of the celebration.
The church was filled and among the
great assemblage of worshipers were
liis Britannic Majesty's Consul General
Courtenay Bennett and members ot
the following British societies: Pick
wick and Burnaby lodges of Sons ot
St. George, Britannia and Victoria and
Daughters of St. George. The pulpit
was draped with the stars and stripes
and union jack. -
During his sermon Mr. Evans took
occasion to deplore the insults offered
Captain Alfred Mahan by some roughs,
who had evidently purposely entered
Tremont Temple in Boston on Satur
day, where the distinguished American
naval officer and author was a guest
of the Victoria Club and was deliver
ing an address on the significance of
Lord Nelson's great victory.
The rector designated the disturbers
as ignorant because they, in their hat
red of England, Imagined that the cele
bration was simply nationalâ for the
glorification of John Bull alone. They,
he said, lost sight of the true inward
ness ofMt, the fact that Trafalgar
saved not only England, but' Europe.
Speaking of President Roosevelt the
reverend gentleman said:. ,\
"The President of the United States
is a righteous man, eminently that.
'Righteousness and square dealing are
the very marrow of his bones. He
stands for doing the right thing, there
fore bis life bears fruit. He can't help
it any more than a tree planted by the
waterside can help bringing forth fruit
in due season." â¢
THREE MEN ARE INJURED
DV STREET CAR ACCIDENTS
James Sullivan, Frank Morris and
Michael Moore ' Are Victim*
of Fate.
Three men met with serious acci
dents yesterday from street' cars.
James Sullivan, who lives at 242 Twen
ty-second street, fell off aÂ£j Potrero
bound car at Twenty-second street and
suffered a fracture of the right clav
icle. ~ \u25a0 . . -.'\u25a0-.
A similar mishap befell Frank Morris
of 405 Capp street while riding on a
Kentucky-street car. He accidentally
fell off the car and was seriously in
jured. His skull was deeply lacerated
and it may be fractured.
Michael Moore, a teamster living at
1204 Folsom street, suffered a deep
laceration of the scalp by being struck
by a Market-street car opposite
Eighth. Moore was under the Influ
ence of Intoxicants and while trying
to board a moving, car was knocked to
tho ground. Several inches of flesh
was torn from his scalp. Dr. O. C.
Kuclch of the Central Emergency Hos
pital did some surgical grafting to
cover the wound.

COMMISSIONERS TO
MEET THIS MORNING
Mu s t Receive Positive Guar
antee From Suspended Con
cern Before They Will
Let It Resume Business
To-day's events in the matter of the
United Bank and Trust Company, Mills
building, whose doors were closed Satur
day morning by order of the Bank Com
mission, will be watched with interest by
the business and flnr.ncial element In San
Francisco.
Whether the bank shall be permitted
to reopen, whether a receiver shall be ap
pointed, rests with the commission. From
statements made by a member of that
board, it does not seem that the Insti
tution will be permitted to resume with
out an almost complete revision of its
methodÃ and a strong guarantee that it
will not again lapse lnto_the way of do-
Ing business that the commission object
ed to. >
On the other hand the officers of the
bank declare that they are within the
law, that they have plenty of money and
that the institution will resume. At a
meeting of the depositors and stockhold
ers yesterday President Meyers practical
ly hurled defiance at the commission,
saying that if the stockholders would
stand by the officers the commission
could do the bank no harm. There was
talk of making a national bank out of
the institution.
A committee of seven was appointed
at the meeting to take chr.rge of the
money left by depositors who had agreed
not to withdraw their funds from the
bank, until the trouble was settled.
'MEIERS' FEEL.IXC.J HURT.
The depositors and stockholders of the
suspended bank held another meeting in
the offices of that institution yesterday
afternoon and about twenty additional
depositors signed agreements not to with
draw their, deposits until the bank could
pay its oustandingr bills, provided the
Bank Commission would allow the bank
to continue. r'A suggestion was made that
should the commission refuse to allow
the bank to reopen under the State laws
arrangements would be made to make it
a national bank and thus take it out of
the hands of the State authorities.
President Meyers addressed the stock
holders and again told the history of
the bank for the benefit of those who
were not present night before. : He
said that the only bone of contention was
the promissory notea accepted for stock,
which were payable on the building and
loan plan. None of these notes will reach
$1000 and most of them run from $100 to
$750. He said that the Bank Commission
believed these notes were good and had
Issued a license upon them.
Last Friday, says Meyers, Commission
er Blackstock informed him that the
commission would ask the Attorney Gen
eral's advice about the matter. "When
Meyers went to the bank at 9 o'clock
Saturday morning he found the commis
sion-in charge. He said he felt hurt to
think the commission had taken the step
it had without giving the officers warn
ing, and in conclusion said, "If you will
stand by us, we can go ahead and they
cannot stop us."
' STATEMENT OF FINANCES.
At the conclusion of Meyers' address one
of the stockholders suggested that. In
case the commission should refuse to al
low them to go ahead, they could apply
to the Government for permission to be
a national bank. The suggestion was
Immediately taken up and the officers
stated that, .in their opinion, such a
thing would be possible, as they i had a
sufficient amount of money on- hand to
establish a national bank.
According to the figures given out at
the meeting yesterday the . finances of
the bank are as follows: Total amount
of stock subscribed, $206,618; stock fully
paid, $62,105; notes given on stock, $117,
760 60; amount paid on notes, $28,342 60;
amount to be paid to .date, $90,507..
A committee of seven was appointed to
take charge of, the funds left there by
depositors who have signed the agree
ment , not -to' withdraw until all matters
are. finally settled. The committeemen
are Colonel J. B. Fuller, L. H. Moise, C.
H. Sherman, W. F. Helbing, Captain E.

been given the fullest warning, but had
shown no disposition to 'change its
methods.
OTHER BANKS WERE WARNED.
Other banks throughout the State had
been found pursuing the same methods,
the Commissioner said, but upon warn
ing had changed their ways and had not
been Interfered with. The methods most
complained of were extremely dangerous,
he said, and could not tfe allowed to con
tinue, as they menaced the interests of
every one whose money was held by the
banks pursuing them.
The statements of the Bank Commis
sion make It appear that the suspended
bank was carrying on business after the
fashion of the big life insurance compa
nies of New York that were found, upon
investigation, to have loaned money to
officers and directors and to companies
whose directors also served \ upon the
boards of the insurance companies mak
ing the loansâ passing around in the fam
ily the money the people turned In, as
it were.
One of the most serious charges made
openly by the Bank Commission against
the United Bank and Trust Company is
that in regard to the subterfuge it is al
leged to have ! adopted when told by the
commission that it could not accept
promissory notes as payment for stock
Issued. It Is then alleged to have loaned
the purchasers of. stock money with
which to make these purchases and then
taken notes in security, hoping thus to
evade section 560 of the Penal Code,
which .says: "It shall be a misdemeanor
for a director of a corporation to receive
any note In payment of any installment
actually called in and required to be paid
on the corporate stock."
OAKLAND, Oct. 22.â Bank Commis
sioner C H. Dunsmoor, when seen to
night at his home, 656 Thirty-fifth street,
said: "At this time I am unable to say
whether or not the United Bank and
Trust Company will be allowed to re
open for business to-morrow, and I will
not know until after the meeting between
the Commissioners and the officials of
the bank, which will be held at 9 o'clock
to-morrow morning. At that time final
action will be taken. The' commission is
prepared to consider any proposition sub
mitted by the officials of the bank which
will ' insure the payment of depositors,
and If the bank officials are prepared to
offer, any. settlement which is reasonable
favorable action will be taken. There
has been no meeting of the commission
and the offlcen of the bank to-day and
the affairs of the institution are In ex
actly the same condition, so far as the
Commissioners are concerned, aa they,
were when the bank was ..ordered closed.
I "There Is no doubt that the bank peo
ple will 'submit some proposal to \u25a0 the
Bank Commission to-morrow, but I am
in absolute ignorance as to their plans.
I have seen none of the officers of the
bank to-day, and have r-ceived no mes
sage from any of them rÂ«garding an ad
justment of the difficulty. No matter
what the final solution of the trouble
may be, the commission will see that .the
interests of the depositors are amply
protected." j .
