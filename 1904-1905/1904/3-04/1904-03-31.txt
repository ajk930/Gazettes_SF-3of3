reason for the non-payment up to the

(CTV HE dismissal of the present Botkfn Jury. will make a lot of
JL work for tlie Sheriff's office. To secure the present jury xve
summoned more than 350 talesmen. Their memories had been
blunted by five years of forget fulness. Since the case has been
opened again It Is apparent that nearly crcry one who reads the
newspapers has formed an opinion as to the guilt or Innocence of
the defendant. To secure another jnry will nndonbtedly require tb,e
summoning of a large amount of talesmen and it is doubtful
whether or not n requisite amount of jurymen who are totally on
prejudiced can be secured In the city and cbunty of Sun Francisco.

Conserative Wing of the Party Is

The conservative wing of the party
as distinguished between the radical
Cleveland wing and the extreme
Bryan-Hearst wing, has been pledged
for months to abide by the choice of
New York. If New York should not
Instruct Its national delegates for
Parker and bind them by the unit rule,
all will be chaos in the conservative
ranks as well as in the other two ranks.
That would be taken to mean that New
York had no Y:hoice. and the issue
would have to be fought out on the
floor of the national convention.
A genuine landslide to Parker is held
back only by the fact that the conven
tion is not to meet until April IS; that
there has been a bitter ontest in New
York State between Hill and Tammany,
and the Democrats of the country will
not take Hill's word in advance. They
want "the goods," not a promise. IÂ£
New York instructs for Parker on April
18, that will be taken to mean that
Parker is New York's choice.
This is the keynote of numerous other
Interviews given to The Call corre
spondent to-day by Democratic Sen
ators and Representatives who were
asked the significance, in the national
sense, of the news from New York that
Hill would control the State conven
tion by more than 100 majority and had
pledged himself to instructions for
Parker.
WASHINGTON, March 30.â "If New
York keeps its word and instructs for
Parker he will be nominated and the
contest is over," said Senator Teller of
Colorado to-day.
"Let New York first Instruct for
Parker and the conservative Democ
racy of the South and West will do the
rest.. But New York must first In
struct."

Apparently during the trial Goetjen was composed, but when he was taken to the "Palace Hotel last night he \ developed | such pronounced symptoms of , dipsomaniacal aberrations that the other jurors became alarmed. They told the Sheriff's
deputies of Goetjen's condition and a physician was summoned. At that time Sheriff Curtis came into the hotel and- remained untile he had ascertained that the condition of the juror, was not serious. All the officials concerned refused

opened again It Is apparent that nearly crcry one who reads the
newspapers has formed an opinion as to the guilt or Innocence of
the defendant. To secure another jnry will nndonbtedly require tb,e
summoning of a large amount of talesmen and it is doubtful
whether or not n requisite amount of jurymen who are totally on
prejudiced can be secured In the city and cbunty of Sun Francisco.

Conserative Wing of the Party Is
Ready to Throw Its Votes to
Distinguished Jurist.
The conservative wing of the party
as distinguished between the radical
Cleveland wing and the extreme
Bryan-Hearst wing, has been pledged
for months to abide by the choice of
New York. If New York should not
Instruct Its national delegates for
Parker and bind them by the unit rule,
all will be chaos in the conservative
ranks as well as in the other two ranks.
That would be taken to mean that New
York had no Y:hoice. and the issue
would have to be fought out on the
floor of the national convention.
A genuine landslide to Parker is held
back only by the fact that the conven
tion is not to meet until April IS; that
there has been a bitter ontest in New
York State between Hill and Tammany,
and the Democrats of the country will
not take Hill's word in advance. They
want "the goods," not a promise. IÂ£
New York instructs for Parker on April
18, that will be taken to mean that
Parker is New York's choice.
This is the keynote of numerous other
Interviews given to The Call corre
spondent to-day by Democratic Sen
ators and Representatives who were
asked the significance, in the national
sense, of the news from New York that
Hill would control the State conven
tion by more than 100 majority and had
pledged himself to instructions for
Parker.
WASHINGTON, March 30.â "If New
York keeps its word and instructs for
Parker he will be nominated and the

rest.. But New York must first In

way cleared for the military, but their
efforts Were ' only partly successful.
Several hundred persons, including the

Socialists' criticisms of the army and
the colbnial policy of the Government,
hustled the police, even covertly at
tacking them.
The efforts of former Sergeant of
Police Reuben Wolf, who was dis
missed from the Police Department by
the Police Commissioners for accept

streets, to secure a rehearing, came to
naught in Judge Seawell's court yes
ttrday. The court rendered a decision
in Wolf's suit for a writ of review of
the action of the Police Commissioners
on the ground that the Civil Service
Board and not the Commissioners
should have heard the charges pre
ferred against him and en the fur
ther around that Police Commissioner
Drinkhouse was disqualified to try him
because he had assisted Simpson in ef
fecting the scheme to entrap htm.
Judge Seawell decided that Wolf had
no rpdresa on the first point
because he was neither deputy,
clerk nor employe. but a po
liceman and therefore under the sole
supervision of the Police Commission
ers. In regard to the charge against
Drinkhouse Seawell held that tho
Commissioner in getting evidence of
Wolf's crookedness simply performed
his duty as a Police Commissioner and
was therefore not disqualified from

TELLS OF PLOT
TO KILL POPE
thej' were privy to the fact that some
of the Jurymen had disqualified them
selves.
COURT SPRINGS SURPRISE.
It was after a long wrangle between
the attorneys for the prosecution and
the defense that the big event came
off. When Carl Eisenschimmel had
teen dismissed aftfer a rigorous and
profitless cross-examination, the Dis
trict Attorney notified the court that
the prosecution had two more wit
nesses, who were 111 in bed. He of
fered either to read their testimony
taken at the last trial, to have deposi
tions taken, or to allow" the defense
to proceed and then later to introduce
the testimony of the two missing wit
nesses. To all of these Attorney
Knight objected.
'The defense in this case.", he said,
"will refuse to introduce a single word
of evidence until the attorneys for the
State say 'We rest.* " y* '~'Z :.
On top of this declaration he moved
that an adjournment be taken until
Monday morning, when the missing
witnesses could be brought Into courL
"If I grant this motion," said Judge
Cook. "I shall feel it incumbent on
me, as a result of certain information
received by this court, to order the
jurymen into'The custody of the Sher
iff."
*At this declaration there was a flut
ter in the courtroom and Knight was
on his feet "in a second to demand
some explanation of the remark. â¢
"Your Honor .will readily realise,"
protested Knight, "that a statement of
that character might readily work
*rave injury to .the defendant in this
case. We demand an explanation."
"}Ven." paid Judge. Cook, "it has
come to my notice that an attempt
has been made to tamper with a jury
man now en the, panel."
If the Hall of Justice had com
menced to slide into the bay the sur
prise of the spectators, jurymen and
counsel for the defense could not
have been greater. Only one of the
twelve jurors failed to look a ques
tion into the eyes of his nearest neigh
bor. He was Jacob Goetjen, who
keeps a grocery at Fifth and Folsom
streets. Beforehand he knew'that the
sensation was to be sprung and he
bore it with Teutonic placidity.
SHERIFF TAKES JURY.
"The defense demands that the re
marks of the<jcourt be explained," said
KniphJ, recovering from his surprise.
"If Ihtre has been an attempt to tam
per with this jury we demand an In
vestigation."
"The court." said Judge Cook, "is
inclined strongly to any investigation
that counsel may desire. I will state
that the court is in possessioit- of cer
tain information that tends to show
an attempt has been made to influence
at least one juryman In this case. I
Fhall refuse to develop the matter fur
ther in the presence of the jury, but
if counsel will agree to hear in my
chambers or otherwise the statements
brought to my attention regarding the
jury I will be very glad to present
them. In the meantime I -will place
this jury in the custody of the Sheriff."
At this Juncture Sheriff Peter J.
Curtis came into court and went im
mediately to the Judge's desk, where
he was sworn to care properly for the
jury, allowing the members recreation,
Â¦where all went together and^ guard
ing them from contact with any one
unauthorized to communTCate with
them. Two deputy sheriffs took the
Jurors in charge and led them to the
Jury-room, where they could not hear
the further developments of the in
vestigation. V 'V-
When the last juryman had disap
peared Jodge Cook announced that he
was ready to show why he had taken
Buch precautions. â¢
"Does your Honor intend to hold this
investigation in open court?" asked
Assistant District Attorney Ferral.
â¢â¢Certainly." said Knight. "We want
Knight and' McCfowan, attorneys for
the defense, held a long whispered con
versation and then there was a lull. In
a few words Judge Cook gave it as his
opinion that the bare fact of indiscre
tion on the part of Juror Goetjen in
discussing the case with an outsider
was ground for a disqualification.
Knight arose and .turning to those in
side the bar, said in an audible tone:
'.'The pro'secution is showing the
white feather.' 1
Byington caught " the speech and
flared up. "We are not showing the
white feather to you, Mr. Knight," he
exclaimed warmly." Then he mumbled
something not audible, except the
words "unfair" and "bought."
JUDGE COOK'S* OPINION.
1 Judge Cook was busy in the mean
time in explaining the position of the
court in the matter: }'T-'.O
"From the testimony adduced in re
gard to tampering with this jury I am
free to state that there is nothing In
my mind that reflects on the defense.
Admitting that the statements made
by the two police officers are true it Is
not apparent whether or not it is an
attempt on the part of friends of the
defendant to influence the jury. in her
behalf or a deliberate plot on the part
of her enemies to prejudice her. case.
Either interpretation is justifiable un
der, the evidence adduced. In any case
I feel that this present jury is not
qualified to try further the issues in
volved in this case."
Again long conference resulted be
tween Attorneys Knight and McGowan
for the defense, while counsel for the
prosecution sat immobile. Finally
Knight arose and said:
"Under the existing circumstances
the defense does not feel that it can
submit further to a trial of this case
by the present Jury. The action of this
court in ordering the jury into the cus
tody of the Sheriff Is an aspersion on
my client. It means practically that if
a Jury returns a verdict of not guilty
in this case the community will not.
stand for it. We only desire a fair
trial and not by a Jury prejudiced in
any way. Under the showing of facts
adduced by the court I could not and
would not accept a verdict^ of acquittal
on behalf of my client because the pub
lic might think it was obtained by un
fair means and the verdict would' not
be a vindication. On the other hand
if a verdict of guilty were found I
would always feel there was' something
wrong about it. .Therefore I concur
with' the court that Â¦ the jury should
be dismissed.". ," vv?^ V$^'-
AGREE TO DISMISS JURY.
"We are willing that the present jury
be dismissed on the showing "made,"
said Byington, "and if the attorney for
tVie' defense puts this"" in "the form 'o*
a motion we, shall not object." ,.â¢- â.*\.
*"I move then," saidr Knight, "that
the jury be dismissed." Â° '.
"We wish an agreement that no plea
of being once in jeopardy will be urged
at a further trial," interjected Assistant
Attorney Ferral.
"We are willing to make a stipula
tion as regards that," said McGowan
for the defÂ«nse.
Notwithstanding the unanimity of at
torneys, on both sides as regarded the
dismissal) of the jury Judge Cook held
backtthe formal order until this morn
ing. While he clearly indicated his in
tention of making the order of dis
missal he explained that he wished
until to-day to look over the Involved
points and to. issue his order in proper
form.- In view of "the fact that the
procedure of discharging a Jury in a
famous case while the trial is only half
finished is an incident of legal note
and needs research there was no ob
jection to his order.
In the meantime the jury was placed
in the custody of Sheriff Curtis, with
instruction from the court that the
members might be taken for a walk
or to places of amusement, but that
they must not be separated at any time.
Last night Curtis quartered them at
the Palace Hotel, and under guard of
two deputies they took a post-prandial
stroll up Market street, but no theater
was graced by their presence. They
were given permission to send home
all . these', proceedings above board.
There' must be no star chamber doings
to this -trial.-:-. Â¦
"Very well,?' said Judge Cook, as
Byington nodded assent to an open
Investigation. "Call the officer who
has this information."

Detective Stephen V. Bunner stepped
to the stand and Judge Cook ques
tioned him. The detective said that
Tuesday afternoon, after the adjourn
ment of the Botkin trial, he had fol
lowed Jacob Goetjen, one of the
Jurors, and- kept track of his move
ments.' The juror went into a saloon
at Clay and Kearny streets and took
a drink. From there he walked on
the west side of Kearny stret to Bush
and werit up Bush street about twenty
feet, where he waited. Within a few
minutes a well-gowned woman in a.
blue tailor-made suit and wearing a
heavy black veil, which concealed her
features, crossed Bush street on
Kearny and Goetjen went to meet her.
They conversed for a: minute or two
and the women continued on in the
direction of Sutter street.
According to the detective th*
woman continued on her way toward
Sutter street, while Goetjen retraced
his steps up Bush street to a small
alley leading to Sutter street. Down
this he Btarted and before he reached
Sutter street he broke into a run. At
Sutter street he saw the woman in
blue across the street and both walked
on opposite sides of the street as far
as, Grant avenue, where they rejoined
one another and crossed, entering a
lodging-house at 309 Grant avenue.
Goetjen remained there nineteen min
utes and then came out alone. He
boarded a green car on Kearny street
and the detective left him.
"If your Honor please." said Knight,
"and I am speaking without the hear
ing of.the jury, there does not appear to
be any proof in this statement further
than to show that a juryman, who is a
married man, as far as my recollection
goes, has committed adultery. Doubt
less this same offense could be estab
lished against others on the panel."
"Let us hear further statements in
this matter," said Judge Cook irritably;
He had voluntarily confined Detective
Bunner to what he actually saw and
had refused to allow him to repeat any
conversations he had held with the
juror in question.
GOETJEX TALKS TO CHIEF.
Chief of Police Wittman came next
to the stand. He said that on Tuesday
evening, after the adjournment of the
Botkin case, he had been followed. into
the main office of the Chief of Police by
Goetjen, who took him" to one side and
informed him that on the previous
night he had been aproached by a man
in reference to the verdict he was to
render after the trial. The'Juror stated
that the man was -of ; medium: site;
wearing a brown mustache and was
well dressed. The proposition was
made just after adjournment of court
and while the juror was walking up
Kearny street. The proposer told the
juryman that four t>f the panel had al
ready been secured, but a fifth was
wanted and offered him $50 to aid in
hanging the Jury. Goetjen told the
Chief that he refused the offer and the
man walked off, saying that he would
see him out at his store the .following
night. Immediately Chief Wittman de
tailed Detective Bunner to shadow the
Juryman, and later sent him out to
Goetjen's grocery at Fifth and Folsom.
After Chief Wittman, Judge Cook
asked for further testimony from De
tective Bunner. and the latter detailed
the incidents of his visit to the Juror's
shop. He said : he .introduced himself
as a police officer sent by Chief Witt
man, and asked for some place pf se
clusion where he could hear unobserv
edly the conversation between the at
tempting briber and Goetjen. when the
former called. Goetjen finally said he
did not expect the man with the brown
mustache would ever show up, and
after waiting" over an hour, Bunner
left. He returned later and the Juror
told him his tempter had not been
around.
When all this testimony was in,
for whatever wearing apparel they
needed.. .' â¢, ..'Â¦
HANDWRITING' EXPERTS.
- Until the springing of the sensation
regarding the jury the proceedings were
as flat as the water in a, horse trough,
when compared to the proceedings -of
lively-days gone .before. The usual at
tendance was there, but for the most
part it yawned under the testimony of
experts on handwriting. No matter
how convincing they may be, these ex
perts always fail to touch a chord in
the heart' that 'vibrates to interest.
Even the assaults of Attorney Knight
on the decipherers of human emotions
as expressed by handwriting failed to
revive the lagging interest.
Daniel T. Ames, who admitted under
cross-examination; that he had confer
red the Â¦ title of â¢ "professor" on him
self, was questioned by Attorned Mc-
Govvan for- the defense regarding his
capabilities as a handwriting expert.
He admitted he had been mistaken in
his testimony in the Davis will, con
test. He said his first testimony was
"a thought," and i that he afterward
revised it to the other side, in which
latter case.it was "an opinion." Alto
gether. Ames was not nearly so,im
pressive a witness as Kytka had been
the. day before. *
At this juncture the District Attor
ney called for John P. Dunning, but
the bawling of the bailiff in the cor
ridors failed to produce the witness.
Later he appeared, but was not called
to the stand.
Carl Eisenschimmel, a handwriting
expert,. was next called. He gave it as
his opinion, based on a scientific deduc
tion of facts, that the handwriting on
"the wrapper of the box" of poisoned
candy, the note contained in the box
and the anonymous letters received by
Mrs. Dunning were written by.the same
hand as that which indited other writ
ing which is admitted to be by Mrs.
Botkiri. .
â¢ MR. MEYERS OF TEXAS.
Eiserfschimmel was clear and cool and
during a long " cross-examination . he
frequently scored points over Knight
and at the same time avoided unneces
sary argument. Once Knight handed
hinvUwo paDers -bearing the words
"With love to yourself: and baby," the
second of which the expert threw . on
the floor, after an objection had been
sustained to their introduction. Knight
was mad in a second.
I "Where were you born?" snapped'.the
attorney.
"In Vienna." was the response. 1
"Did you ever live in Texas?" -
"I did." 0
"Did you go by the name of Meyers
there?" - v K . ..... . , : l,-r.:> ;
"Maybe I did; I may have." ._
â "That's "-wttitv -L.-thought/' *- said
Knight. "Now, don't throw any more
papers on the floor. ''<>,
Once KnighVweht blackboard
and wrote '.'Sari Fraiicls'co" in his
usual hand.' , Then he printed the two
words entirely J'out-of style .he
writes and- asked the expert" by, what
he could identify the authorship of the
two writings, 1 aside from the fact that
he had seen' them written by: the same
hand. Eisenschimmel grabbed a piece
of chalk and pointed out so many, simi
larities between the two writings that
Knight abandoned that line' of ques
tioning. Eisenschimmel managed to re
buke Knight for his thunderous tones

After him came Professor -Wolfe,

never heard of it being put to such a
use. Attorney Knight 'took the wit

Foss Explains His Arbitration Bill.
WASHINGTON, March 30.â Arbi T
tration, as proposed in the Foss bill,
drawn by Volny W. Foss of Chi
cago, and providing for a permanent
national board of arbitration in labor
disputes, consisting of seven members,
of >vhlch the Secretary of Commerce
and Labor shall be an ex-offlcio mem
ber, was discussed to-day by the House
Committee on Labor. Mr. Foss ex
plained the provisions of the bill.
' WASHINGTON*. March 20.â The Ben
ate to-day began consider&tloo of the
pestofflre appropriation bill end It was
the signal for a renewal of the Demo
cratic demand for an Investigation of
the charges of corruption in the Post
office Department.
The debate was Initiated by Gorman,
Â¦who spoke for almost two hours In
criticism ef the course of the Repub-
Ikan party in the Senate In refusing
en inquiry and at the same time charg
ing the Pestofflce Committee with un
due haste In reporting the bill, as he
did the Republican party with a desire
to adjourn Congress at an exceptionally
early date in order to meet the wishes
of the President. Clay contended that
there should be a Congressional In
quiry, saying the charges against
Heath, ex-First Assistant Postmaster
General, were such as to demand In
vestigation. Penrose and Lodge spoke
for the Republican side of the cham
ber, defending the Committee on Post
offices against the charge of haste and
also the administration. Lodge con
tended that Congress could not makÂ£
an inquiry that would be as thorough
es that already made by the Postofflce
Department. He charged the Demo
cratic attack to a desire to find a po
litical issue. Scott quoted District At
torney Bear* and Assistant Attorney
General Robb as saving that there was
r.ot sufficient evidence upon which to
Ir.dict Heath.
GORMAN OPENS DEBATE.
When the postofflce appropriation bill
was taken up Gorman addressed the
FÂ«nate. e&yfng that notwithstanding
the bill carried $170,000,009 the Senate
Committee on Postofflces had spent
only two days in its consideration, and
that note, -srtien only four days have
lapsed since the bill carne from the
House, the Senate was asked to pass
tipon it. He could not comprehend th
haste displayed. Indeed, he asserted,
from the beginning of the session there
apparently had been some mysterious 1
influence at work In connection with
th* pogtoffice matter. He did not mean
to b^ understood that either the Post-
r.aster General or any of the principal
Assistant ''Postmasters General had
been untrue to their trust, but so far
is information had been allowed to
"iZÂ« oui ifc had shown that there had
to-pn laxity, in the department. He also
paid that there # had been persistent
Cf nial at the privilege of Investigation
of the affairs of thr Postoffice Depart
ment and c he urgred that it was not yet
too late t c o take, steps to prevent
"further robbery and thievery in the de
partment"* .
He thÂ»n 'reviewed the eJforts to se
cure authority for a Senatorial inves
tigation . into* postoffice affairs. Citing
the varjo.us resolutions introduced to
that e-od. hg said: *
Â¦"I doubt -whether under similar cir
cumstances a similar resolution has
ever tÂ»een fought so v-gorously." In
deed, he said. "iir. Pcnrese, chairman
of the Â° Committee, on* Postofiicfcs, was
the ce!r Republican who had not stood
out against an Inquirj;. Xor had the
denia* been confined to investigation,
for h!s c ov#n simple resolution asking
fpr the report of the Fourth Assistant
F^sTtrsagter General, anfl that of Messrs.
Corrrad â¢ zayl Bonaparte had been re-
Kitted and the resolution passed over
for the time. In view of the fact that
the reports had already been printed
h? ha<l not been able to 8ee the reason
for thÂ«se tactics.'
"It .is said," he went on, "that Con
gress must. adjourn speedily: that from
one source a.' request amounting to or-
tiers has genÂ© out; that it is incon
venient for on o e branch of the Govern
ment to- have Congress on its hands:
that If there is delay there are likely
to be disagreeable inferences from what
has already been developed."
In face of*]VJr. Lincoln's greatness, he
Bald, She Senate had Insisted on in
vestigating the conduct of the Civil
War. After the close of the war there
had been much corraptlon, and then
the Republican majority In the Senate
did not hesitate "to authorize an Inves
tigation.
"So," he said, **yom may follow It
through all administrations to McKin
ley and /there will be found no denial
of the right of inquiry."
McKinley, he continued, was glad to
afford opportunity for examination of
the conduct of the Spanish war. "He
was a wise and. patriotic man and had
nothing to conceal," said Gorman, "and
he knew that the honesty and fair deal
ing of his administration should be
subject to examination. " We have
reached a time when there is much
preaching of honesty and high-mind
edness, but corruption bubbles out. It
came like a fog and has not yet lifted
and we cannot tell whether all the in
formation Is yet out."
Gorman said the charges made by
the Postofflce Department he believed
had been made for the purpose of. di
verting attention from the guilty ones,
who had filched money from the treas
ury and abused their trusts.
For himself he was of the opinion
that members had not done more in
the matter than their duties required.
In this connection- Gorman called at
tention to the habit of criticizing men
engaged in legislative work and he
concluded that this criticism grew out
of a well-directed effort to build up a
one-man, Czkr-Hke government.
POWER OF PATRONAGE.
The power of patronage is great,"
he went 'on. "The Commissioner of
Pensions is relieved and sent out of
the country and another man brought
to Washington and given a place. But
that is not enough. The pension roll
is increased by an executive order to
the extent of from $5,000,000. to $15,
000.000." He (Gorman) had never made
an objection to liberal pensions, but
his criticism was that Congress was
becoming a mere recording body.
"We are now told." he continued,
"that, having approved the plans of
the executive, we must adjourn and
go home because of. the fear of damag
ing disclosures. There are jnatters
which it is almost criminal not to give
attention to. Yet we are not to be
allowed to stay," He th<?n referred to
pome of the pending legislation and
included in the list Foraker's bill for
the amendment of the anti-trust v law
regarding transportation. He referred
to Attorney General Knox's statement
regarding the bill, saying that it was a
derwirtinental measure. â¢ â¢ â¢â¢
Senator Foraker said the Attorney
General "had not given out this state
ment until challenged to do so by the
Democratic press.
This remark, Gorman retorted, was
the utterance of a true soldier in the
ranks. Discussing the anti-trust law
and Foraker's amendment, Gorman
said the effect of the law was to re
quire the publication of rates like
those given by Hill on his trans
continental oceanic lines with the re
sult that competing nations got the in
formation. Amendment therefore was
necessary and Foraker's bill had been
intended to meet that demand. But
with this, as with other matters of
legislation, said Gorman, the executive
interferes and notwithstanding the
need for legislation the mysterious
order is sent out that Congress must
adjourn Â¦without taking up the ques
tion. "How long," he asked, "are we
to submit to such a system?" The
idea was, he said, that all should be
left in the hands of the executive and
that nothing should be done until after
November next. In the meantime, he
continued, the law would be suspended
and the matter controlled by the exec
utive order, with the result that trade
conditions would be so disturbed that
the farmers of the Northwest would
go in enormous bodies to the country
across the line.
HONEST HEX NOT RARE.
The American people do not want
one-man control, Gorman continued,
but they would have the law -itself
changed and then would have the law
obeyed. He hoped that such action
would prevent one-man control in the
next four years, whosoever might fill
the "White House. ' It was not enough
to say that the President was honest,
lor honest men are not rare. "Occasion
ally a dishonest man may creep in, but
he is soon disposed of," said Gorman.
Judgment and good discretion also
were necessary In the conduct of pub
lic affairs. It was not so much a ques
tion of honesty, of the chief executive
or his immediate advisers. Gorman
said he did not hold Roosevelt or his
Cabinet officers responsible for the
"thievery in the department." Gorman
said he did not believe ex-Postmaster
General Smith had been cognizant of
the bad condition of affairs In the Post
office Department, as Bonaparte had
charged. Bonaparte was of the class of
reformers who believed that almost all
men in Congress and other places. were
corrupt, and he (Gorman) knew Smith
too well to follow Bonaparte in the
charge of corruption made against
him.
.Still he felt that sufficient has been
shown to demnostrate that an investi
gation should be had. He closed by de
claring that the Postofflce Department
was "honeycombed with corruption
and inefficiency."
Penrose. chairman of the Committee
on Postofflces, said that while originally
he had favored an Investigation he had
now reached the conclusion that none
was necessary. Penrose challenged the
accuracy of Gorman's statement that
extraordinary haste had been exercised
by the Committee. on Postofflces in the
preparation of > the bill.
LODGE MAKES REPLY.
Lodge also replied to Gorman. There
had been no undue haste in . bringing
the postoffice bill into the Senate, and
he declared all suggestions made to the
committee had been thoroughly consid
ered. "The party In power." he pro
ceeded, "the party responsible for the
Renews Demand for an Investigation of the Oharges
of Corruption in the Postoffice Department and
Opposes an Early Adjournment of Congress
conduct of affairs, has deemed It best
to bring about an early adjournment if
It can be done. So far as I am aware
there have been no instructions received
from anybody in. any quarter. It was
not onvthis side of the chamber that
the expression 'cuckoo* originated. That
word Is chargeable to the Senator, fram
Alabama and applied to his side of the
chamber." â¢
Lodge declared that the. Democrats
had criticized the early meeting of Con
gress and now was criticizing the pros
pect of early adjournment. It could not
possibly be that their vain' efforts to
secure a campaign issue after their fail
ure to secure it in the efforts alreaSy
made by the navy and pensions could
be a new departure.. Nor was it reason
able to believe that such an opporunlty
was wanted to review the anti-trust
law, in view Â©f Cleveland's explanation
that he had failed for wants of time
to put the anti-trust law In force while
he was in office.
So far as 'the postofflce investigation
was concerned Lodge said no general
inquiry was necessary after the ex
cellent work Â£one by Bristow and his
corps Of trained detectives.
TAKES ISSUE WITH LODGE.
Clay took issue with Lodge's 1 state-j
ment that the Democratic party h'ad
opposed the called session of Congress
last fall. On the contrary, he said, the
opposition had come from the Repub
lican party. He charged that the early
adjournment of Congress was sought
to prevent the opening of the books
and the getting at of the truth. He
declared that if Bristow's accusations
against ex-First Assistant Postmaster
General Heath were correct he was
as guilty as Machen. He was pro
ceeding with mentioning Heath speci
fically, when Mallory Interrupted to
ask If he meant the present First As
sistant Postmaster General. Clay re
plied that he did not, that the meant
the ex-First Assistant Postmaster
General, not Wynne, "whom I esteem
most highly as an upright man."
Clay referred to the charges against
Heath In the matter of the employ
ment of J. H. Livingstone, O. H. Smith
and M. W. Louis, superintendent of
supplies, saying that the charges had
been made that Heath had escaped in
dictment only because of the statute
of limitations.
Scott read a letter from Assistant
Attorney General Robb of the Poat
offlce Department, saying that the evi
dence did not warrant the indictment
of Heath.
Clay replied by saying that Scott xas
the only champion of Heath that had
appeared on the floor of the Senate,
and Scott replied that it was Mr. Robb
and not himself who was the cham
pion.
"Then," responded Clay, "he has not
a single champion here to defend him."
Scottâ According to Mr. Robb's state
ment, he does not need any defense.
CHARGES AGAINST HIM.
Clay replied by giving the details
of the employment of Mr. Louis as
superintendent of supplies for the
Postoffice Department, which he said'
had been accomplished by Heath by
first appointing Louis as cashier in the
Kansas City postoffice and then hav
ing him proceed with the work here
without ever having seen the Kansas
City postoffice. Heath, he said, had
been anxious to secure a rn^.n in sym
pathy with himself in the purchase of
supplies, and the appointment to Kan
sas City had been made because of
Louis' inability to pass the civil ser
vice examination. Reviewing Louis'
career In the department. Clay said
that he had increased. prices paid for
supplies from 20 to 75 per cent.
"All this," said Clay, "is interesting.
You may pick on Bristow If you wish,
but he has done a work that I appre
ciate."
He then proceeded to give specific
instances of the charges against Louis,
including in them the one that he had

pound, and Instead had contracted to
pay 30 cents. Nor would he concede,
he added, as Scott suggested, that this
had been done because the 16-cent ink
was not adapted to the purpose to
which it was put^
He urged an Investigation as the
only method of determining the truth
of the charges made. The 'President,
Bristow and Messrs. Conrad and Bona
parte had all said that Heath should
be investigated, and he thought they
should be taken at their word. If Bris
tow's charges against Heath were not
true they constituted .a slander, and
Heath should have the right to defend
himself against them.
Scott said it had never been his pur
pose to believe a man guilty until he
had been proven to be, although Heath
may be all the Senator from Georgia
had charged hinvlvith. He read from
a statement by MKBeaoii, attorney for
the District of Columbia, to the effect
that all of the evidence was before
the Grand Jury, and that it was re
garded as Insufficient to warrant the
indictment of Heath.

Japanese military and naval officers
who are familiar "with Sanshantao de
clared that the quarantine station there
did not exist before the war.' .
Responding to the protest Baron
Komura, Minister of Foreign Affairs,
informed the French Minister that tne
Japanese Government has received no
report from -Vice Admiral Togo con
cerning the destruction of the quaran
tine station: but, whether the station
had been destroyed or not, the article
of The Hague convention - quoted re
lated only to land. battles, 'the 'conven
tion having left the question of naval
bombardments unsettled.
The Russian Government, througn
the French Minister here, has lodged
a protest with the Japanese ' Govern -
ment against the destruction o.f the
quarantine station at Sanshantao dur
ing the fourth Japanese attack on Port
Arthur. The protest is based on article
twenty-five of The Hague international
peace convention, a copy of which Is
submitted with it.
The special Diet concluded its labors
yesterday, finally* passing the series oÂ£
war tax and financial measures pro- !
posed by the Government. Almost the
entire financial programme submitted
by the Cabinet was approved, although
several changes were made. The
amount to be raised by special taxation
was reduced from $34,000,000 to $31,000,
000. The Government plans to make
up the deficit thereby created in the
estimates by cutting down the ad
ministrative expenses. Another change
in the programme s was the refusal to
sanction the creation of a salt mo
nopoly. (-. e '
An interesting feature of the financial
legislation is the passage of an act
authorizing the banks to issue savings
prize debentures. . The total issue of
these debentures is limited to $15,000,000
per- year. The rate of interest* the
amount" of the prizes and a lottery
drawing scheme are limited. The whele
plan ends when the war is over. The
Government has the ' right to borrow
the money realized by the sale of the
savings prize debentures, but the man
agement, sale - and redemption of th f :
debentures is entirely in the hands of
the banks.
The changes in the customs tariffs
become effective after six months. The
articles affected include confectioneries,
preserves in sugar, silk fabrics, alcohol,
kerosene, sugar, molasses, syrup, crepe
de chine, satins, manufactured to
bacco. Chinese spirits, ordinary sake
and all alcoholic beverages containing
more than 50 per cent of alcohol. Con
sumption taxes are levied on woolen
fabrics and kerosene oil. . .
The tobacco monopoly was passed.
The compensation to be paid the man
ufacturers will be a sum ecjual to the
amount of their sales for three years.

of Kyte and the order of the Rising
Sun on Commander Hirose, who was
killed during the attempt'to "bottle up"
the Russian fleet. A movement has
been instituted to erect a monument to
the memory Gf Commander Hirose.
WAR TAX BILLS PASSED.
"The following torpedo-boats and de
stroyers participated in the movement:
The .destroyers Shirakamo, Kasumi,
Asashio, Akatsuki, Akebono, Oboro,
Inazuma, Aodaka, Tsubame, Ikatouchi,
I'sugumo, Sazanami and Shinonome;
torpedo - boats Karigane, Misasas 1 -.
Manadzuru and Hato."
"The crews aboard the Chiyo Maru
and the Yahiko Maru were taken .on
board the destroyer Tsubame. The crew
of the Yoneyama Maru escaped in three
boats and were rescued by the destroy
ers Misasagi and Karigane. The crew
of the Fukui Maru was taken on board
the Kasumi.
"Commander Hirose, after causing
his men to take to the boats and not
finding Sugino, searched through the
ship three times for him. Finding his
ship gradually going down. Commander
Kirose was compelled to give up the
search and enter a boat. As he was
rowing away under fhe enemy's fire a
shell struck him on the head. His head
and part of his body were blown away.
Only a piece of flesh in the boat w.as
all that remained of the brave officer's
body. Commander Hirose was always
a model officer and he leaves a meri
torious example, the memory of which
will be everlasting.
TOKIO, March 30. â Admiral Togo's
report of the attempt to block the en
tranofe to Port Arthur harbor last Sun
day gives the following additional de
tails:
"Commander Hirose and Boatswain
Sugino, who were killed, displayed re
markable courage. Boatswain Sugino
was just going down to light the maga
zine on the Fukui Maru when the ship
was struck by an enemy's torpedo,
which killed him.
HAMBURG, March 30. -At the an
nual meeting: to-day of the stockhold
ers of the Hamburg- American Steam-
Fhip Company a plan was formed by a
number of stockholders to ".r.terpellate
Herr Ballin, the director general of the
line, in regard to the reported sale to
Russia of vessels belonging to the com
pany, but it was explained to them
that oolitical reasons rendered such a
question Inexpedient. The interpella
tion therefore was withdrawn.
Secrecy Cloaks Sale of Ships.
SEOUL, March 30.â The Japanese ad
vance columns occupied Haiju, a port
south of Anju.'on the 27th inst.
The Korean Progressionists claim to
be disappointed at Marquis Ito's action
in discouraging radical government
changes, which in reality checks the
alleged reformers' speculative schemes.
The Japanese legation retracts the
statement made that Marquis Ito was
proceeding to Chenampho. They claim
that when he departed he intended go
ing there, but that, the naval authori
ties did not approve of it, so he re
turned to Japan.
JAPAN'S ADVANCE

"The Americans wish to convert the
Pacific into an American Mediter
ranean. Would that be to the . ad
vantage of England? . Does England
not understand in her blind policy and
hatred toward Russia that she is turn
ing this ocean into an American Medi
terranean? Sooner or later the Euro
pean countries will recognize that
America is their mutual enemy. Why
should not Russia, and England, in
view of their possessions outside of
Europe, combine?
"Some one will do England a great
service by warning: her of the econ
omical and perhaps political Sedan
which will be effected by the Japanese
and Americans. Russians and Eng
lish do .not clash. Russia does not
want India, but only access to the open
sea from Vladivostok and Port Arthur.
They are like two planets, which, by
combining and supplementing each
other, could dominate the world." *
"Remember that that nation, in the
person of the commander of one of
its men-of-war at Chemulpo, refused
to join in the collective protest of
the other foreign commanders before
the Japanese destroyed the Variag and
the Koreitz. Remember whose flag
alone among all did not. take on board
the crews of our perishing ships. To
the honor of England, the ally of
Japan, it was not her representative,
but the commander of an American
ship.
LIST OF GRIEVANCES.
"All Â°this," says Hanotaux,' "points
to the fact that on account of business
interests the United .States is willing
to risk the peace of the world."
The foreign critic of the Echo says:
"If the Russian bear should show his
teeth j both English and Americans
would soon think it pest to be good.
It is otherwise certain that the day
will come when Russia will interpret
anew the Monroe doctrine as meaning
that Americans must not put their feet
outside of America." â¢ .,-. Â¦â¢-Â¦:
ST. PETERSBURG, March 30. â The
Novoe Vremya to-day executed a face
about, strongly supporting the idea of
a Russo-British understanding in an
editorial entitled "The Blindne.ss of
England," in which the paper argues
that the success of Japan would be
more injurious to Great Britain than
to any other European nation, and.
points toi*' the United States as the
common rival of both. It describes
Japan as "America's- sharpshooter"
and says:
IIAXOTAUX'S DEDUCTION.
For a moment the fury of the press
against England seems to be abating
and to be directed against the Govern
ment and people of the United States
for their alleged desire to mix in the
conflict. Â» Even Hanotaux, the former
Foreign Minister, believes the main
danger of a widening of the war cen
ters in Washington. He points out,
in confirmation of this opinion, the
series of pinpricks administered to
Russia at the opening of the war â
Secretary Hay's note, the incident of
the Dainy and Mukden Consuls, the
talk about the Mandjur's refusal to
leave Shanghai, the protest against the
placing of mines in the harbor of
Inku and the English and American
Consuls* protest against the .declara
tion of martial law in Newchwang.
PARIS. March 30. â As an indica
tion of the restless, nervous state of
public opinion here may be men
tioned the ready acceptance of a state
ment wired from St. Petersburg to the
effect that Japan has been promised
secret support by the United States in
exchange for the island of Formosa-
Even the Temps credits to a certain
extent this wild rumor, in spite of the
indignant denials of the Japanese le
gation.
Special Dispatch tfc The Call
"In such conditions no prediction
about the war seems -isafe, except that
it will.be long and obstinate. Many
newspapers were very much too pre
vious in treating the opening of the
first phase of the war as if it Â»ere
the beginning of the end. Even if every
thing should go favorably with the Jap
anese arms, it will take them a year
or so to catch up to the forecasts made
after the first attacks on Port Arthur."
miral : Makafbff," on his" side, will en-Â»
deavor to entice the enemy to an en
gagement against the Russian forts,
plus the* Russian ships.
"In such maneuvers personal In- 1
itlatlve and resource may count for
much and the advantage here seems
no .longer to be all on;' the Japanese
side. ; ;
Another expert says: "With every
day's delay the Russians are bringing (
up men and they have had time to
recover from their first demoralizing
surprise, to revise their plans and
strengthen, many of the wÂ«yik points
in their position. They were in con
siderably numerical inferiority when
the war began. They have something
like equal forces now."
.The Daily Chronicle points out that
the war has entered upon the second
.phasa, and says: "Japan's command
of the sea is not now quite so certain
as it seemed a little time ago. The ar
rival of Admiral Makaroff bn the scene
has, as the Minister of Marine admit
ted in the Japanese Diet, infused new
spirit into the Russian. defense, and
the Japanese command of the sea is
now perceived to be comparative and
precarious, rather, than absolute and
certain. ' C*I
;"Time is on Russia's side. Later in
the year the Russians may send out a
second fleet and it is all important to
the "Japanese to defeat the existing
fleet first. Admiral Togo will thus do
all he can either to snut Admiral
Makaroff off or entice him out. Ad-
LONDON, March 31.â The tone of the
articles in to-day's London papers is
further evidence of the change that has
come over the sj>Jrit of the London
press.
"Either through bad luck or bad
management, Japan has o not taken full
advantage of her initial success," Rear
Admiral Inglis writes. "People are talk,
ing as though the Russians are" win
ning; but, on the contrary. It is only
that Japan has not been making as
much progress as she did at first." .-

"The Japanese press censorship is
rapidly tightening. It now extends be
<ycnd military movements wid even in
cludes references to local disturbances.
This censorship applied t& private i e tÂ»

Editorially the Daily Mail finds somo

chance away: and the Daily Telegrapn.
also, while declaring that "unique In
convenience is caused newspltners
throughout the world," agrees that
Japan cannot afford to run the risk
of losing a single trick in the war game.
The Seoul correspondent of. the Mail
describes Korea, outside the districts
occupied by the Japanese, as being in
a state of anarchy and in readiness for
rebellion. The correspondent asserts
that the censorship prevents any ref

SEOUL, March 3o!â It is believed here
ihat the engagement fought at Chongju
on Monday will prove to have t^en the
first/and last to occur on Korean soil
during - the war. The Russians' con
tinue to retire from all points north
ward toward the' Yalu, evidently en
deavoring to compel the Japanese to
attack' the strong fortifications on the
river, where the Russians will make
their standL
ST. PETERSBURG, March . SO.â A
later official dispatch from .Genera!
Mishtchenko reports that, on the au
thority of the inhabitants at Chongju,
Korea, the Japanese lost forty ' men
killed, 100 wounded and a number of
Ivrses during the fighting there Â«on
Monday. The Japanese employed .500-
Korean bearers to carry their' wounded
to Anju. General; Mlshtcheiiko adds
that Captain Stopanoff, who was
among the Russian wounded, died yes
terday. The foregoing; which! was
dated March 29. was forwarded to the
K:nj>eror by General Kuropatkin.'
LONDON. Mar.ch 30, â The Japanese

"On March IS a portion of our cav
alry axÂ»d infantry forces occupied
â¢ "hongju after defeating the enemy.'
The enemy, who numbered about 600
mrn. retreated In the direction of Wiju.
*jur casualties were Lieutenant Kano
and four others killed and Captain Ku
rokaua and twelve others wounded of
the cavalry force. There were no cas
ualties among our infantry. Two dead
bodies were left by the enemy on the
field, but it is reported that some seven
or eight were killed inside the town.
ThÂ»sÂ«; were promptly carried off by the
ineny on horseback or by ambulance.
The Russians were seen conveying in
an ambulance two dead men, appar
ently officers, and blood stained band
aces were found scattered around. The
Â»nemy must have sustained losses at
!~ast equal to our own."

District Attorney \ Allen gave it as

who i have their race j animals at the
Emeryville 'track must pay their taxes
on the same into the. treasury of Ala

James C. -Nealon, ex-Assessor of San
Francisco, who owns Royal Rogue, Rey
Dare, Cassie W and several good
ones. He contended that they should
properly be assessed in San Francisco.
.Assessor Henry P. Dal ton thought
he saw ,'a scheme of the horsemen to
evade the payment of any tax, and a
lively meeting ensued between Nealon
and his attorneys, Dalton and District
Attorney Allen. The matter was passed
up to the latter for his opinion, in
which he quotes the following from a
Supreme Court decision:
"To authorize the taxing of personal
property in any county, than .that in
which the owner resides,- it must appear
that the property is being to some ex
tent kept or maintained in such county
and is not there casually, or. in transit,
or temporarily in the course of busi
ness or commerce."
: It Is field that these horses are being
maintained at the track, and not there
in transit.

at his rooms. Powell arrived there
Sunday from a long trip through New
Mexico, Arizona and Mexico. The ho

his usual good spirits. Monday he left
the hotel apd was not seen again there.
At 4 o'clock Monday afternoon Powell

Mrs. Barbara Page, 64 years old,
widow ofcCharles Page, committed sui
cide this morning by drowning herself
in Temescal Creek. Her body was
found at 1 o'clock this afternoon In
the creek where it runs through the
New California Jockey Club r<tÂ»-e track
at Emeryville. The aged woman had
been despondent ever since her hus
band's death, which occurred six
months ago. She had also been dis
turbed because her application for
a pension as a Civil War veteran's
widow had not been granted.
Mrs. Page disappeared from her
home, 5157 Vallejo street, Golden
Gate, early this morning. Her son
in-law, August Lindow, organized a
searching. party as soon as her absence
was noted. Near the San Pablo-ave
nue crossing of Temescal Creek a
piece of Mrs. Page'.* dress was found
caught In a barbed-wire fence. Thence
the creek was followed until race track
employes recovered the body. '
The old lady had been acting
strangely and had twice attempted to
commit- suicide since her husband's
death. He was a tailor, employed by
the United States Government. The
body was taken in charge by the Cor
oner.

Brooklyn Township.
Geary did not eee the car approach
ing, as ne was running across the shop
tracks, and the moving vehicle hit him
squarely on the back. There was no
chance for him to save himself. Be
sides the back injury Geary was badly
.hurt about the head. At first it was
thought his skull had been fractured,
but after critical examination the hos
pital surgeons said the injuries to the
head were not so serious.
Edward Geary, an employe of the
Oakland Transit Consolidated, was
struck by an electric car at the Pied
mont power-house this afternoon and
his back was broken. Geary was cross
ing a track in front of the car, which
was being run into the repair shop,
when he was knocked down.
â¢ The injury caused complete paralysis

WANTS TIMBER ACE REPEALED.
W^ASHINGTON, March 30. â A
hearing on the Senate and House bills
for the repeal of the timber and stone
acts of the rjublic lands was held to
day by the Senate Committee on Pub
lic Lands. Representative .Hogg of
Colorado vigorously protested .against
repeal of these laws and Representa
tive Reeder of Kansas favored their
repeal. Reeder asserted that the pub
lic lands of the country were being
disposed of under these acts at an
alarming rate and at a price ($2 50)
per acre) much belo^v their real value.
In this way* the' valuable timber and
stone lands were being acquired by
large holders.. .Millmen and lumber
men were acquiring timber-lands and
the stone lands were being gathered
in by quarrymeh. A man would buy
160 acres at $2.50 per acre and then
sell the same to_a company..
Hogg maintained that if the repeal
bills were reported Colorado should be
eliminated from their operation. The
men who secured land under the tim
ber and stone acts in his State were
poor men. and if they did sell to a
corporation they made a profit on the
deal, which was perfectly legitimate.
The committee postponed consider
ation to Friday. , .

South for disregard of violations of

SACRAMENTO, .March 30. â A
claim, for nearly $2,000,000 against the
State of California was to-day filed by
E. B. Holladajv an . attorney of San
Francisco, with. W. S. Melick, secre
tary of the State Board of Examiners.
The claim for the money is made by
the Union Trust Company of San
Francisco to recover from < the -State
the sum of $847,000,- with; interest at
the rate of 6 perl cent, amounting to
$1,122,750; running; since 1873.
A special act was passed by the
Legislature in 1872 by which a Board
of Public Works was created ih San
Francisco. Bonds were issued by the
board for. the purpose of , opening,
widening and .extending Montgomery
avenue. The bonds were known as
Montgomery-avenue bonds. Later,
when the bonds were attacked in
court, it was shown that there was
not a sufficient frontage of property
attached to the petition, so the bond
holders went into the courts and there
has been a contest on for many years.
The bondholders always brought suit
asainst the city of San Francisco. The
State Supreme Court and the United
States Circuit Court have both held
that liability -does not attach to the
city. ; ,
Now Holladay has brought suit
apj-'iinst the State, holding that the
State is liable because that Board of
Public Works was the agent of the
State, specifically made so by an act
of the Legislature, and as the agent
of the State had failed to note that
the petition was not sufficient.
Secretary Melick said the claim
would be taker? up at the next* meet
ing of the Board of Examiners and
would no doubt be rejected by that
body. The trust company will then
be in a position to again take the
matter up in the courts.
Neumann's presence in this city and
the unlawful' relations of Coker and
the woman were' entirely unknown to
any one except District Attorney Boyd.
As a result the appearance of the in
jured husband caused quite a stir in
the court to-day and his testimony
completely overthrew Coker's case. The
verdict was guilty of assault. Infme
diately after . the trial Neumann pre
ferred a charge of adultery and Coker
as held under $1000 bonds. The more
serious charge of perjury may be
placed against him to-morrow.
SAN, RAFAEL, March 30.â The Brad
l>ury-Coker assault case proved ex
tremely interesting .to the spectators
to-day when August Neumann, who ar
lived here frqm Arizona this morning,
testified that the- woman who has posed
as Coker's wife for the last nine
months is really Dorothea Neumann,
his own wife, who eloped from Pinal-
County, Arizona, with Coker on Sep
tember 18, 1902. The assault charge
preferred against Coker by Bradbury
is the Result of a remark alleged to
have been made by Bradbury concern
ing this woman's honesty.
Cokar accused Bradbury of calling:
his. wife a thief, and demanded an
apology. ' Bradbury denied making
such a statement and was knocked
down) by Coker for refusing to.apolo-.
gize.
Prior to Neumann's appearance on
the stand both Coker- and the Neu
mann woman swore that j they were
married in Marenco, Mexico, about four
years ago. After being brought face
to face with her erstwhile husband,
however, ,the woman broke down and
admitted that she had neither divorced
Neumann nor married Coker. -
LOS ANGELES, March 30.â J. H.
Overholtzer of Audubon, Iowa, former

to-day sentenced by Judge Smith in
the Superior Court to serve two years
in San Quentin for forgery. Overholt
zer forged the name of Mrs. Mary Grls
wold to deeds for property in Pasa
dena and attempted to dispose of it.
A dramatic scene was enacted in court
when Overholtzer was sentenced. Over
holtzer's attorney pleaded for leniency
for his client on the ground of former
good reputation. A letter from Sena
tor Allison waa read in support of the
plea. After court had imposed sentence
Overholtzer arose and requested the
court to change the sentence to life
imprisonment. The request was denied.
Overholtzer is 64 years of age.

The. rector is low church and his
service will be about the same as those
he conducted at Middletown.- His wife
died nine years ago, leaving him with
a little girl, Miss Madeline, who is now
10 years of age. The little miss accom
panied her father to the coast and is
his boon and constant companion. The
rector and his daughter are stopping
at the Granada and are the guests of
William Mintzer.
The Rev. Mr. Evans will conduct the
first, service of his rectorship of Grace
Church on Easter Sunday.
After three years at Holy Trinity
the Rev. Mr. Evans accepted a call to
Grace Church, Middletown, and, though
he had several calls, one to Trinity
Church, Tacoma, he was always averse
to leaving his parishioners.
After the death of- the Rev. Mr.
Foute, Messrs. Gwynne and Crocker,
two'of the vestrymen c-f Grace Church,
were in the East, and at the Instance
of Bishop Potter saw the Rev. Mr.
Evans, which resulted in his receiving
the call to Grace Church, this city.
The Rev. Mr. Evans spoke feelingly
of his predecessor, the late Rev. Mr.
Foute, whom he had heard of as a
lovable man, and whose methods he
hopes to follow closely.
The new rector has had a varied ex
perience, both as a university man and
a clergyman. He is a graduate of Jesus
College, Oxford. After leaving Oxford
he became classical master at Lancing
College, near Brighton, and subsequent
ly acceded to the wish of the Rev. Dr.
Walpole Warren and left England for
America, becoming curate and assist
ant to Dr. Warren at the Church of
the Holy Trinity, New York City.
During that time he had charge of
a mission belonging to the church on
the East Side, which brought him in
daily contact with the poor of that
district of the Empire city. His con
gregation at the mission was largely
composed of the very humble inhabi
tants and was for the most part made
up of Germans and Bohemians.
CAIXED TO GRACE CHURCH.
The new rector of Grace Church is
an affable and scholarly man. He is
tall in stature and wears a wealth of
hair, streaked with gray. His manner
gives the impression at once of the
student, while his conversation is kind
ly, spontaneous and courtly..
He is glad to be here. This he did not
admit in the conventional way, but said
it as if it came from deep in his heart,
and yet there were moments of regret
in his tone when he spoke of the good
people of Mlddletown, N. Y., where he
was rector of Grace Church for nearly
thirteen years.
SPEAKS OF 'LATE RECTOR.
By a happy coincidence Bishop Nich
ols and Archdeacon Emery happened
t6 be on the beat on which the new
rector was crossing the bay on his
way to San Francisco. There was,
therefore, an unlooked for pleasure for
the Rev. Mr. Evans, who received a
warm and cordial greeting from both
the Bishop and the Archdeacon.
The Rev. David J. Evans. B. A., the
new rector of Grace Church and suc
cessor of the late Rev. R. C. Foute,

This afternoon she was taken before
Judge Hyland to be examined as to her
sanity. She speaks rather incoherently
and seems to be ill. The court ordered
her into the custody of Mrs. Irene
Frost, who conducts the Red Cross
Sanitarium. Mrs. Frost was instructed
to take charge of her effects. It is be-
Ilved that with treatment and rest Mrs.
Huston may recover. ;â¢:,.-# : ..-Â¦'â¢
Mrs. Huston is about 30 years of age,

the finest kind of clothing.
Mrs. Huston became angered at a

volver and threatened to shoot him. It
was decided to have the woman taken
into custody and examined as to her
mental condition. The police office was
notified and Chief of Police Carroll and
Detectives Prindiville and Pickering
hurried to the hotel. Mrs. Huston was
in her room, armed with a can of red
pepper. When her arrest was attempt
ed she threw red pepper in the eyes of
the Chief and Detective Pickering. She
was taken to the Receiving Hospital
and then to the Red Cross Sanitarium.
The woman said she was the di
vorced wife of Captain Samuel Miller,
who commands the steamer Boston,
sailing between New York and Euro
pean ports. She said that her home was
in Washington, and that Huston was
her maiden name. She was married
to Captain Miller six years ago. Four
months ago she secured a divorce from
him at San Augustine, Fla., as he was
cruel to her. Several months ago, ac
cord ins to her stwry, she left Washing
ton with a party of friends for Califor
nia. She made the trio for the benefit
of her health. After a stay in Los An
golrs she Citnie here two weeks ago.
SAN JOSE. March 30.â An insane
woman, armed with a revolver and a
can of red pepper, created a great deal
of excitement at the Hotel Vendome this
morning. The woman came to the house
two weeks ago from Los Angeles and
registered as Mrs. Belle Huston. Ever
since her arrival she has been acting
queerly and the other guests noted her
condition. She imagined she was being
followed by persons to harass and in
jure her.
A report of McGeoghegans defalca
tion has been given to District Attorney
Campbell by the city officials. It is
said the arrest of the ex-Treasurer will
..< cur to-morrow. The report will aiso
be placed before the Grand Jury by
the District Attorney.
What puzzles the city officials is
v here the missing $8700 from the treas
ury has been spent. They can find no
trace of where McGeoghegan spent
large sums of money during January
and February. Had he spent anything
like $8700 in those two months it would
have attracted attention. In counting
the money in the vault after the surety
i-ompanies assumed control of the of
fice a /ew silver half-dollar pieces vÂ«re
found in among the stacks of twenties.
This showed that a twenty would be
t.-:ken and a- piece of silver substituted
to make the pile the requisite height.
The surety companies served notice
<>n District Attorney Campbell .thai
they would expect him to prosecute
MeGeoghegan and all others implicated
In the misappropriation of the' city
funds.
nearly three weeks ago, McGeoghcgan
has been constantly shadowed by a de
tective. His friends have been trying
to raise the amount of the shortage,
Lut they have not been able to do so.
It was believed that if they could "se
cure the money the bond companies
>uuld not prosecute. McGeoghegan
cinies that ho took any of the money
from the treasury and intimates the
ccin was taken by some of the hangers
on about his office. He is said to have
bondsmen ready to secure his release
v hen arrested.
HAN JOSE, March 30.â The defalca
tion of ex-City Treasurer T. J. Mc-
Geoghegan has been fixed at JS769 14.
Kxpert C. J. Keane made a reoort to
this effect to the City Council this
afternoon- The examination of the
books In the treasury shows that the
entire sum was taken between January
1. 1S04. and March 6. 1904. Between the
1st and 30th of January over $5000 was
taken. The misappropriation of funds
is from moneys collected for municipal
licenses. The records were falsified lu
covering up the shortage.
Mayor Worsxvick read a lengthy re
port on the matter. He said Attorney
J. E. Richards had been hired to help
City Attorney Brown In the matters
arising from the collection of the de
falcation from the surety companies
and in the prosecution. At the Mayor's
eugpestion his report and that of the
expert were referred to the finance
committee of the Council to report at
the next meeting.
The United Slates Fidelity and Guar
antee Company and the American
Konding Company, each of which is on
McGeoghesan's bond for SS'J.OOO, have
been notified of the exact amount of
the shortage. They have agreed to pay
tin 1 money over at once and as
as this is done Jt is said McGeoghegan
will be arrested.

NEIGHBORHOODâ Subscriber, City.
Neighborhood is a word used only to
designate place. It is proper to say or
write that the houses immediately ad
joining a square are in the neighbor
hood of that square, while those which
are somewhat farther removed are In
the vicinity of the square. It is im
proper to say or write "the loss by the
fire was in the neighborhood of $5000"
or to express that a man was robbed
of $30 In these words: "He was robbed
of In the neighborhood of $30." The

The Morgan of Japan.
Baron Shibuzawa is called the J. P.
Morgan of Japan; says the April
World's Work. But he is more im
portant to Japan's Industry than Mr.
Morgan is to the United States, for
the industry of the United States can
in a sense get along without J.. P. Mor
gan, but the industry of Japan cannot
do without Baron Y. Shibuzawa. The
Baron was a farmer's son. 9s served
the Shogun, and went abroad with one
of the Shogun's relatives. After his
return he was called by the Mikado's
Government to serve In the Finance
Department. In 1873 he resigned his
office in order to- enter the business
world. He . advocated the combina
tion of capital not only in the banking
business,, but also .in all other busi
ness, such as railroading, manufac
turing, mining, transportation on
water, and so forth. He. also advo
cated scientific and systematic business

TRIBUTE TO VIRTUE.
ONE of. the salient features of almost every issue
of the organs of the yellow candidate for the
Presidency in these days* is the number of ap
peals made therein for what they call "a decent respect
for private life." The organs urge. that there should be
no scandals tolerated in the discussion of Presidential
politics, no studies made of the private life of any can
didate. They take the lofty ground that any man .who
aspires to the office of President of the United States
should be assumed to be of virtuous life, and pure mind.
That assumption, they argue, is essential not only to the
dignity but to the. decency of politics, and they lament
sorely because some people show signs of a desire to
make the private life of, one of the candidates asubject
of inquiry and investigation. .'.'.- '
The plea thus made\wijl on the whole find a favorable
response in the minds of the people. Even; if the; animus
of the. plea be no more than hypocrisy it is none, the less
a tribute to virtue. It is gratifying to know there is at
least one scandalous life which yellow journalism is not
willing to exploit; one political campaign in which it is
Queen Alexandra ate a nine-cent dinner the other day

great cause that labors for the well-being of London's

than many Â¦ a feast where the motives of men and
women ofhigh degree ruled in vanity and ambition.
China has seen ftt to commission a naval squadron to
hover" on her coasts and guard her seaboard interests.
Unquestionably this is not an overt act in violation of
neutrality. It is simply a shining example of oriental
idiocy.- Even China should be convinced in the bitter
school of '.experience that. while she ft an adept in play
ing with firecrackers she should eschew firearms.
Russians resident in New York and prominent in their
identification with the affairs of the home country declare
that the war now smoldering in the Far East is, on the
part of Russia, primarily a conflict for self-defense. To
an outsider it seems a calamity that some genius has not
taught the Czar and his people the art of self-defense,
but perhaps they have one of their own and some day
may revcalit to an admiring world.

Slow to the "wanton sun's desire
The vestal-bosomed buds unfold.

And buttercups a glassy gold.
How gently fare the cloudy flocks
To pastures girdled by the sea!
The lizards twitch along the rocks,
And subtle odors lure the bee.
There broods a peace upon the hills.
Too vast for morning winds to break.
Though murmurs throng the broken rills.
And voices of the woodland wake.
Till half I turn to hear again
The flutes of Arcady at dawn.
And rout of hurrying nymphs that feign
To dread" tho kisses of the faun.

Attorney Matt Sullivan is famed /or
his method of handling witnesses. /He
does "ot waste much breath In pro
pounding long, complicated questions.
On the contrary his questions are short
and sharp, and in consequence their
meaning is usually grasped by even the
dullest witnesses. It was therefore a
great surprise to the attorney when a
few days ago a witness in a damage
suit in Judge Graham's court appeared
nonplused when Sullivan said to him:
"Mr. Kelly, were you In a position
to observe the position of the left hind
hub of the vehicle at the time the car
and the dray collided?"
"Answer the question," said Judge
Graham, when he saw the witness mak

Sullivan will take the college trim

Misplaced Advice.
Bob Duke, deputy clerk of the Su
preme Court, was coming downtown
Sunday on the big blue car that runs
through from the Cliff House to Ellis
and Market. At Devisadero street two
women and three children got On with
a big basket of what appeared to be
picnic lunch. As the car started Bob
overheard one of the women ask the
other: "Are you perfectly sure this car
goes to the Cliff?"
"Oh, yes, I am positive." was the an
swer. >
"Well, we must not make any mis
take or the children will be terribly dis
appointed." said the first Then they
eat complacently, while the car speeded
onward to town. Here was Bob's
chance. He hated to "butt in." but the
thought of those poor, innocent children
being carried to the ferry instead of to
their picnic grounds on the beach was
too much, so he gallantly said: "Mad
am, excuse me, but you are on the
wrong car; this car is not ' going to
the Cliff."
"Oh, yes, I know!" she answered
somewhat stiffly. "We are not going
to the Cliff until next Sunday. V
Then it is reported that the phil r
anthroplst apologized for his existence
and went away back on the car and
sat himself down to ponder on the
curious ways of woman â of which he
knows so little.
IMPROVEMENT OF SACRAMENTO
SACRAMENTO is , rejoicing because the China
Slough is be filled by the Southern Pacific Com
pany and that the reclamation will be followed by
the creation of a fine public park upon its southern mar
gin. For some. years this work has been in view. When
the park is in actual existence it will first greet the eyes
of travelers as they enter the city. Â«V:i
First impressions of cities as of individuals are strong.
Appreciation of this fact was a large factor in the crea
tion of the ferry depot at the foot of Market street in
this city. The taxpayers when they were called upon to
vote on that issue had only to view the old and tumble
down sheds 'that preceded the present building to arrive
at a conclusion that the State could better afford to
spend its money than to go on with shacks only: at the
front door of its chief city.
There are three principal objects that Sacramento as
a municipality has long believed to be advisable. These
are to have the Southern Pacific freight and passen
ger depots continued in their present close connection
with the commercial districts of the city; the reclama
tion of the China Slough; the raising of the grade of the
district north of I street to the thirty-foot level in con
formity with the downtown sections of J and K streets.
These aims are all secured by the China Slough. filling.
In addition to these advantages other benefits are as
sured. A permanent station for passengers will be con
structed south of the. present one. A district which ac
cording to .the Sacramento Union "has long been aban
doned to the "most unsavory element of population" will
be changed for the better. Chinatown will be driven
away to some less conspicuous neighborhood.
The Sacramento Chamber of Commerce is entitled to
the credit of the new move in behalf of Sacramento. A
committee of that body 'has just reported progress in
accordance with the facts that are summed up in the
foregoing. The conditions. attached to the promises of
the railroad company to fill the China Slough are that
the people of Sacramento shall â as the railroad gives to
the city its holdings in the blocks bounded by Third
and Fifth and H and 1 streets for park purposes â buy
the private holdings to fill out these blocks. The cost to
the city will be something like $33,000. The Chamber of
Commerce committee, prior to making its report, se
cured for $23,000 options on all the private holdings ex
cept one lot. The City Trustees of Sacramento have
adopted a resolution of intention to buy the property in
consideration of the carrying out by the railroad com
pany of its part of the agreement.
Sacramento is clearly in the line of improvement. It
is the capital city of the State and all citizens of Califor
nia are interested in having it made as attractive as pos
sible. In a lesser waj*- public interest is concerned in the
appearance of. Sacramento as Americans generally are
interested in having the city of Washington, D. G, as
handsome as it can be made. - The women of Sacramento
have already organized thoroughly to attend to improv
ing the city. With a new park, with v the removal of a
noisome feature of city life to the background, and with
the promotion of improvements of all sorts, Sacramento
is on 'the up grade. Â»-
President Roosevelt has been presented with a hyena

for the biggest game it may be the fortune of an Ameri

looks. He mentions an acquaintance,
iou' aged S3, who began to read seri
ally In 1837, and who is' still devouring
.U literature. Four times has this in
atiate reader perused the whole of
Jibbon's mighty "Decline and Fall of
he Roman Empire." He balks at noth
ntr, and has conquered all those monu
nental books which "no gentleman's
ibrary should be without." It is evi
lent that this sort of regimen is not
or the busy workers of the earth, but
or the lotos eaters who have infinite
elsure. and who might have been
â¢hristened in accordance with Charles
crab's plans for the son who existed
Â»nly In his day dreams, "little nothing
o-do." For the most of usâ even those
vho love to read, and do read wisely
tnd well â there usually remain a large
rumber of books which we are ever
banning to read. Year after year men
Â¦iy to themselves that at the first op
>ortunity Goethe's "Faust" shall be in
iiiired into. What manner of wonder
ful book was it that Bishop Butler
moteâ "The Analogy of Religion"â
vhich has held master minds captive
or generations? What is the perennial
!harm of Marcus Aurellus, of Thomas
I'Kempis. Malory's "Morte d* Arthur"?
fVhy is It that ten thousand books and
nonographs â a formidable library in

'Divine Comedy" in the form of mere

Frederic Harrison, the English
;rltic, gives the useful advice that a
ulse .education, which, in fact, de
?endii?-b i o\Jto4iclous.J.reading, should
eave^rio "great "i> : pe of thought, no
lominant phase of human nature,
Aholly a blank. He says:
"Whether our reading be great or
small, so far as it goes, it should be
jeneral. If our lives admit of but a
jhort space for reading, all the more
Â¦eason that, bo far as may be, it
thould remind us of the vast expanse
jf human thought and the wonderful
variety of human nature."
The besetting sin, however, is the
lissipation of time and the attention
an waste places, on the ephemeral,
he flats and deserts of literature. We
hang around the back door when the
palace gate stands wide open, admit-
Jng to the wonders of the world, with
jlimpses of heaven. It is vain to urge
the ordinary modern, looking for dis
iipation. to read the best book?. "They
Â»re such hard reading," is the an
swer. Emevxin said that the library
is the true university and that there
should be professors of books. It was
a wise word. A professor of. books
would point out to the most careless
of mortals that there are examples of
literature which are as light and as
absorbing, as full of gayety and gen
uine fun as Falstaff. There are books
which require no greater effort of at
tention than a "turn" on the vaude
ville singe, and they are classics. Don
Quixote has more fun, more jokes,
more quips and cranks than all the
minstrel shows on earth; they are
good ones told with infinite zest and
charm; It has more philosophy than
a meeting of the Metaphysical Soci
ety, with a good deal more sense and
wisdom; it has more interesting and
stirring adventure than a modern his
torical novel, and more genuine hu
mor in its first chapter than was ever
comprehended in the philospohy of
the association of "Jokesmiths" re
cently formed in Baltimore.

H. B. Marriott- Wat6on, literary critic
for the Lor.don Mail, has p. few re
marks to say about the alleged "de
cadence" of fiction. Says he: "In the
National Review Miss Jane Findlater,

question, Is fiction deteriorating?
."Nothing and nobody, I am sure, will

(hat It is a pity novelists are putting it
abroad that every woman Is at heart
a rake. But are they? 'We need,'
the thinks, *a return to nature.' But
is not that precisely what the school of
vriters she finds fault with is aim
ins at?
. "Hiss Findlater, no doubt, would say
that this class of fiction only represents
â¢me side of nature. Well, It is possible
;i does. But there are many other
hinds of fiction to represent other sideA

Thus he established a paper mill in
Aji, in the suburb of Toklo, and con
ducted the Industry according to his
ideas. In 1876 he was of the opinion
that the railroad business could not be
perfected bv the Government's efforts
alone. He has favored the private own
ership of railroads. He has been for
twenty years one of the trustees of the
Ninon Railroad Company. He effected
the merging of the Chlkubu line, the
largest for the transportation of coal,
with the Klushiu line. /
He should not, however, be count
ed upon as a railroad king, as Jay
Gould was in the United States; for
the idea of the Government control of
industry, largely borrowed from Ger
man state socialism, gained its adher
ents among younger men than Baron
Shibuzawa, and they came into power.
Paraguayan Minister.
Dr. Cecilio Baez, the newly appointed
Paraguayan Minister to the United
States, will arrive in New York this
week or next. For the last fifteen years
the republic of Paraguay has discon
tinued her diplomatic representation at
Washington and has maintained there
only a Consul General, the Hon. John
Stewart, but has also maintained Con
suls General at New York and other
large American cities. The Interna
tional influence of the United States
having grown up recently, and com
mercial and industrial developments
having considerably Increased In Para
guay, the Government at Ascunsion
has considered it necessary to send
again a Minister to Washington. Its
choice fell upon Dr. Cecilio Baez, who
was well known and appreciated in
that capital, where he sojourned some
days, as well as in New York, three
years ago, when he made a tour of the
United States after having been an ac
tive and eloquent member of the Pan-
American conference in Mexico. Dr.
Baez is one of the most influential poli
ticians and statesmen in his own%coun
try, and is besides a journalist, littera
teur and lawyer of prominence. He is.
like all Paraguayans, a sincere admirer
of the United States. He comes here
accompanied by his wife, two daugh
ters end three sons. Before his de
parture from Asuncion a banquet was
given him by North American residents
in Paraguay, at whose head was the
American Consul General. J. N. r.uffln,
who is almost as popular among the
Paraguayans Â«d is Dr. Baez himself.
' V S a result of the blockade of Venezuelan ports
Z\ treaties were made under which the claims for
>*A. money and property stolen from foreigners by
that Government were to be arbitrated by special inter
national commissioners, and the question of preferen
tial treatment of the blockading powers was sent to the
Hague. The international commissioners have finished
their work and made their awards, and, at the Hague it
was decided that the blockading powers had preferential
rights.
To all this Venezuela was bound by treaty-' She had
no right to expect other results than those that were
reached by arbitration. She cannot claim that racial pre
judice affected the result, for the Latin races were repre
sented in the arbitration commissions. The Spanish
Minister to Caracas was chosen to consider the Mexican
claims, and when he made a proper award he was as
sailed by personal abuse in the newspapers and was in
sulted in the street. The time has come now for Castro
to observe his international obligations, and begin pay
ing the awards in the order detided upon at the Hague.
Of course 'he is not doing it. Pay day is abhorred by
Latin-America, with some exceptions.- "The Monkey of
the Andes" makes treaties only to violate them. His
disregard of his obligations raises again the question of
the sufficiency of arbitration if there be no means of en
forcing its payments.
The Hague is a court without a sheriff. Its findings
are the highest judicial decrees known to the world, but
they are worthless if they cannot become judicial finali
ties by enforcement. The Hague convention needs re
vision in Jhis respect. It should be made to provide that
when a nation, found in default by the court's decree, re
fuses or neglects to keep faith, it shall be the lawful right
of the nation suffering by that breach of faith to take
entire possession of the revenue external and internal of
the defaulter and administer it until the collections pay
the claim and the cost of administration. That will give
the court actual power and vitality and will at the same
time lessen the number of cases that go to it.
As long as the convention has no provision for en
forcing a decree nations like Venezuela are very willing
to go to it. All international courts are a projection of
the principle of our ordinary judicial courts into the af
fairs of nations. But our judicial courts command re
spect because their judgments can be enforced. . If it
were otherwise their dockets would be overcrowded; for
every litigant would be entirely willing to get "into a
court that could not enforce its judgments. Otherwise
many litigants arc willing to settle out of court and save
the costÂ«of trial.
In the situation created by Castro's disregard of the
awards and of the Hague decision it is said that Ger
many proposes another naval demonstration and she will
doubtless be joined by the other preferential powers.
This means more turmoil in the Monroe hemisphere and
another strain in- our relations with Europe. Castro is
entirely capable of causing a most serious condition,, that
will go far beyond a blockade, for his conduct may com
pel the landing of a military force and the occupation of
his capital as well as the blockading of his seaports.
His conduct may be such that we will have to interfere
to prevent the conflict taking on the nature of a con
quest. The fellow is entirely capable of going to such
lengths as to put the United States in a very difficult
position. Were he capable of reasoning, or had he any
genuine patriotism and sense of responsibility, he would
keep his treaty pledges' c and extricate his country from
the serious position in which it has been placed by his
blunders and crimes.
One recent occurrence has disclosed his recklessness
and ingratitude. The American. Minister, Bowen, went
to the verge of diplomatic propriety in standing by Ven
ezuela. When he appeared at the Hague as a representa
tive of Castro his statements in favor of Venezuela were
irritating to the European powers concerned, and we
commented on them at the time as being far more ex
treme than his position and duty required.. Not only in
Europe but in Washington Mr. Bowen pursued this
course, causing considerable embarrassment to our State
Department. If Castro were a normal person and Ven
ezuela a civilized country the friendly attitude of Minis
ter Bowen would be requited at least by decent personal
treatment. But instead of this Castro's official organ
has vilely lampooned and libeled him and his Govern
ment. It has . slandered MacVeagh and Penfield, the
eminent American counsel who appeared for Venezuela
at the Hague, and has incited hatred of them and their
Government by sheer lying.
There is no doubt that this course was taken by Cas
tro's orders, for when Bowen appealed against these
calumnies to him and the. Minister of Foreign Affairs he
refused ,to compel a correction of the falsehoods, de
claring that he would not limit the freedom ot the press.
At the same time he suppressed and confiscated a news
paper that had told only the truth' about his own con
duct. This conduct is exasperating to the highest de
gree. But it will have one good effect. The fate of
Bowen will admonish other American diplomats that his
course gets no favors in return for friendship, and they
will not repeat his acts and expressions of sympathy.
The Midnight Alarm.
The tale about the Stanford fresh^
man who passed the "prof" the high
sign, which appeared in these columns
yesterday, isn't a marker, according
to some Berkeley men, to the rich yarn
they have to tell about a certain fra
ternity over at the University of Cali
fornia.
It seems that one night when all of
the members save one had long, been in
bed, that single exception to the peace
and sobriety of the fraternity wandered
homeward about 2 o'clock in the dawn
ing with his head filled with a wicked
scheme. Once in the house he filled
a coalscuttle with rags and paper and,
lighting the mass, -carried It on tiptoe
through the halls upstairs until the
atmosphere was blue with smoke. Then
he slipped down to the front door,
yelled "fire!" In his most terrifying
tones and went across the street to lie
down in a vacant loi and watch the
fun.
It came.
There was a flashing of lights from
room to room, calls and hurried orders.
Windows were thrown up and wild ap
peals were sent out Into the night.
Then down the front steps,' arrayed
only in a scanty "nighty" and - a silk
opera hat, came one of the senior mem
bers, carrying a dress suit and a sack
of tobacco in his hands. Hardly had he
deposited his treasures on the fence
than a window was sent hurtling up
and a fearsome stream of coats, socks,
tennis racquets, pipes and dress shirts
gushed forth. Another college youth
appeared in fine negligee to drag the
garden hose into the parlor. A third
hunted, for the garden spade with which
to dig up the* hall carpet.
Then, to mark the -climax, the foot
ball hero' of , the house, in crushed
strawberry pajamas and a sombrero,
heaved his huge bulk out on thÂ«
eaves of the house from a third-story
window and began gravely to feel of
the shingles as he scuttered along the
roof drain. That was too much. There
came a wild yell of demoniac laughter
from the lot across the street, a rush
of phantom figures in the direction of
the fellow rolling there in paroxysms
and thenâ the accounting. ,

" 'If Miss Yonge and her generation
avoided the realities of life our authors
of to-day, emphasize them in a , quite
unnecessary manner, and the one pic
ture is fully more untrue than the
other.' One can only rub one's eyes
and wonder if this is the twentieth cen
tury. Is fiction deteriorating? \ It be
gan with 'Torn Jones,' let us say. Are
we never -to extricate ourselves from
the net of mid-Victorian anti-macassars
and prudery? We have no master
pieces to place .beside 'Esmond' â
which, by Ihe way, was^ highly im
proper; and 'Pickwick,' which treated
drunkenness 1 much too lightly-^-but
the level of English fiction to-day is
far higher, and, on the whole, It is
healthier than fifty years ago."
Two of the new books of the spring
season relate to Matthew Arnold and
his influence in letters, thus indicat
ing the belief of experienced publish
ers that Arnold's influence is not only
still potent, but is likely to grow with
the increase of literary culture. "Mat
thew Arnold and His Relation to the
Thought of Our Time; An Apprecia
tion and a Criticism," was written by
William Harbutt Dawson, who asserts
that the "cult of Matthew Arnold" is
growing and must grow. This cult,
Mr. Dawson explains, is the cult of
"idealism," using that word to indi
cate "the pursuit of perfection as the
worthieit working principle of life."
The book is in three parts, entitled
"Culture." "Religion" and "Politics."
and there are chapters on "Arnold's
Philosophy of Life," "Hellenism and
Hebraism," 'Che Three . Estates,"
"The Critic of Dogma," "The State and
the Church," "The Science of Govern
ment" and "The Party System." Mr.
Dawson holds that "than Matthew
Arnold no man more ardently preach
ed the duty of opening the mind to
the free play of ideas as the first step
to clear and independent thought, and
no man justified the precept more
completely in himself." G. W. E. Rus
sell's "Matthew Arnold" is the first
volume of a new series of "Literary
Lives," edited by Dr. Robinson Nicoll.
Mr. Russell edited two volumes of
Arnold's letters for publication ' in
18 95. His new book Is not nearly so
long or so formidable in apppearance
as Mr. Dawson's. It is divided into six
chapters. It ouglit to serve admir
ably as an introduction to the sys
tematic reading of Arnold.
While the public has grown thorough
ly tired of the Carlyle-Froude dispute,
and while it is undoubtedly true that
Carlyle himself is not read as he was
a. generation ago, it would be exceed
ingly rash to -assume that the reading
world has lost interest in the philos^
opher of Chelsea. A new volume of
.his letters, dating from 1836,. where the
second volume of the correspondence
edited by Professor Charles Eliot Nor
ton ends, is about to be published by
John Lane, and will be a literary event
of moment. The letters are edited by
Alexander Carlyle. and bring the cor
respondence up to Carlyle's death in
1881. Here is an amusing example from
these new letters of Carlyle's, one to
his brother John about a new hat:
"Why do I babble all these things to
a judicious doctor? Let me add, how
ever, that I have got my white hat!
A most noble broad-brim; price 6s 6d;
of great comfort to me, and this not
by the brim alone, I find, but also by
the size, which lets in the air about
me and prevents the Intrusion of head
ache. I find my last three or four hats
have been far too little. Jane shrieked,
nay, almost literally grat (wept) when
she first saw me in such headgear.
However, I persisted (resolute against
headache), and she now says I do very
well in it. Cockneydom happily does
not seem to mind me- at all, tho' prob
ably there is not such another beaver
within the four parts of London."
Rudyard Kipling's most famous and
characteristic sentence, "But that is
another story," has now been traced
to Sterne's "Tristram Shandy," and all
the writers who have found it impos
sible' to resist the temptation to pla
giarize will no doubt rejoice.vlt is hard
to say just how much of the fascina
tion of Mr. Kipling's tales must be at
tributed precisely to those "other stor
ies"âthe glimpses he gives us of a
whole world of glamour which he might
reveal if he chose. The cynical may
call it a "bluff" â despite Mr. Chamber
lain's aversion to the. word and thingâ
but it really is a legitimate part of
Kipling's trade. The fdTce of literature
depends as much upon what is sug
gested as upon what is revealed, and
in the matter of stimulating hints the
author of "Plain Tales From the Hills"
is almost unrivaled. . "Kim," for in
stance, is throughout a suggestion of
adventures that are about to happen,
but are always postponed.
Richard Whiteing's "The Yellow
Van" is listed among the books in
steady and popular demand at public
libraries and in x the book, stores and
the author's views on the province of
the novel take on fresh* interest. At
a recent English literary club., dinner
Mr. Whiteing is quoted as having said:
"The novel . performs a service to so
ciety analogous to that of light cav
alry. It goes forward, sees everything,
does not Drobe all, but shows how a
thing is affecting the hearts and minds
of simple men a'nd women and what
they are thinking about. Once this -is
put before the people, they are on their
way to reform."
And the author of T "The Yellow Van"
and ."No. " 5 John Â¦ Street" went â¢; on to
say that he doubted much whether the
technique in fiction was ever so good
as to-day.
The "Magpie Club" in London, .whose
members are clever young English
writers sworn to criticize one another's
work with merciless severity, has been
in , existence about twelve years. The
club circulates among Its members a
manuscript magazine , in ~ which, their
work.appears. Not ttntll this year has
any of the members' fiction , been con
sidered by themselves worthy of pub
lication. A. 'Â¦' R. . Weeke's* "Yarborough

novel produced by a member of the

eager to have at least the appearance of a respect far
decency. The gain thus made may not amount to much
in the way of a public benefit, but it is at least \50me
thmg. It is a demonstration that yellow .journalists
know what decency is, and that they are willing to ap
peal, to it when they hope to profit by it.
â¢Just how far they are willing to practice what they
preach remains to be seen. The American people de
light in clean politics and face the coming ' Presidential
campaign with the expectation that it will be clean. Up
to this time there is no suggestion of indecency other
than that found in the protests of the yellow journals
themselves. That is the weak point of all their, frequent
pleas and arguments on the subjecj. They protest so
much that. even the most indifferent reader will be some
day prompted to inquire 'whether there is in the Presi
dential race a candidate whose private -life is of such a
.nature that the publication of it would be'a scandal. In
other words,- the yellow organs in_ their unwonted insist
ence upon clean politics may overdo the thing and de
feat their own desires by. their very eagerness to appear
virtuous. > â¢

P.' J. Hazen, attorney for the Mo
desto irrigationists, has also sent a
communication in which he says that
it is most important for his clients to
know before deciding on united ac
tion what steps San Francisco has al
ready taken under the law providing
for the acquisition of a municipal wa
ter supply, in order to determine the
extent and power "of her liability in
any measure which may be agreed
upon before such measure is passed.
The letter continues:
Tour remark that "we cannot submit any
proposition to the voters till we have ob
tained an available supply" seems to me to
place the situation in a Btrange light. I can
hardly think that its full scope and meaning
are borne out by the law and the facts, though
former proceedings seem to have been largely
based on that theory. If San Francisco cannot
vote to issue bonds for the construction of
water works until all the rights, privileges
and property . necessary to make - water sup
ply "available" have been ; "obtained," it
seems to me she will have some difficulty in
proceedlne: and I have often wondered why
it seemed bo much more necessary to "obtain,"
in advance, the rights and privileges which
the Government still controls and which It
fseems Inclined to conserve for the public good
than those which have passed into private
â¢wnersh'p. I understand, though I have no
definite knowledge on that point,, that much
of the land needed to make these reservoir
sites available for water storage is in tho
hands of private parties. In that- case, it
ir.l~ht be wise. for the Government to retain
control of the availability thereof till the pub
lic interests are sufficiently protected.
Letters were received yesterday by
Chairman Braunhart of the Supervis
ors' Public Utilities Committee from
R. M. Williams, president of the Tur

that meetings of the two boards will

The opinion is the result of a com
munication sent to the Assessor by
Morris Marcus, secretary of the Con
gregational Church Extension Society,
protesting against assessing two mort
gages f dr $5555 and $4000 on the Park
Congregational Church.
Long's opinion continues:
My attention is directed to the fact that
the mortgages referred to are non-interest bear
ing and are v.itliout commercial value. I find
no Justification in the law for a treatment of
that class of mortgages differently from those
securing it more businesslike investment. The
azresEinent and taxation of propÂ«rty cannot,
under any system, be made to depend upon its
earning- capacity and that alone. To adopt such
a rule of taxation would result in not only
the unequal taxation of property similarly
owned and held, but would put a premium
on the retirement of money from profitable em
ployment on the tax day. While the value of
the property may be and penerally Is af
fected by its earning capacity, it would effect
the exemption ot vast volumes of property held
only for Fceculative purposes or as' the result
of bad invtstxaents to admit that property earn
ing nothing should enjoy exemption from taxa
tion. I find nothing in the fact that the mort
gages in question bear no Interest to sustain
a distinction upon which such an exemption
may he based, and. consistent with the views
expressed by ex-Attorney General Ford and
Mr. Lone, I advise that they be assessed.
"ThÂ« question is one that Is not free from
doubt, but what doubt there may be should
be resolved in favor of assecsment and taxa
tion of rccrtgaireÂ« upon church property, it
being wilMn the power of those otherwise ad
vised to protect themselves by payment upon
vlsÂ»d to protect themselves by payment under
protest." (Opinion of City Attorney. 1899
1!Â«.'"J. p. 438-443.) Especially Is this trua, it
may be- added, when the object sought is the
extenolon of an exemption, since such exemp
tion murt result In an increase in the burdens
required to be borne by property remaining
subject to the tax.
City Attorney Long filed an opinion
yesterday with Assessor Dodge in
which he holds that non-interest bear
ing church mortgages are not exempted
from assessment. Long coincides with
his predecessor, Franklin K. Lane, who
in an opinion said:

Notwithstanding â¢ the fact that Rich
ard E. Lowe, the wealthy Klondiker
who recently filed a suit against his
wife, Virgie Graves Lowe, formerly a
well known actress, to recover $150,000
worth of mining property and personal
property of great value, claimed at the
time that the suit was but the result
c-f a temporary disagreement and that
it would never be forced to 'trial, the
fact remains that the Lowes have had
considerably niore than a "temporary
disagreement." Proof of this was.fur
nished yes'terday by the filing of a suit
for divorce by Mrs. Lowe against Lowe.
She alleges intemperance, charging that
for more than a year last past he has
indulged in intoxicants to such an ex
tent that her married life has during
that time been decidedly unhappy.
The fact that the Lowes have not
been on Â¦ the best of terms for some
time became patent several months ago
upon the ; filing of Lowe's suit to re
cover property he claims he deeded to
his wife at the time of his marriage
at Oakland in 1899 to hold In trust for
their common benefit. As a reason for
his suit he set forth that some time
ago, after a disagreement, he made a
demand upon his wife for the return of
the property and that she refused,
claiming" to be the sole owner. Mrs.
Lowe, in the divorce, 'proceedings, re
fers to the property and asks that the
court decree to whom it shall belong.
;A-year of married life has satisfied
Charles H. . Holcomb that life as a
bachelor is preferable. He yesterday
filed a suit for divorce against Emma
E. Holcomb on the ground of cruelty.
He makes no specific charges.
, 'Suits for divorce were filed by Al
vina Glazer against Frank Glazer for
desertion and neglect, Deborah Evans
against David Evans for desertion, J.
L. Ingelbretson against Georgina Ingei
bretson for desertion and Carrie Self
ridge against W. O. Self ridge for neg
lect.
A decree of divorce was awarded by
Judge Troutt to Maggie E. Ward from
Charles E. Ward for neglect.
Judge Hebbard refused to amend the
decree of divorce granted ,by him last
October to May F. Stein from Charles
M. Stein. The amendment was sought
by Stein, who asked the court' to take
from his former wife the child awarded
to her custody on the ground that she
was unfit to care for it.
i The statement that will be trans
. mitted to the Board of Supervisors to
! day declares that the sum of $1,679,865
j will be required for all purposes dur
j ing 1904-1905. Of this amount the Board
j of Education figures that $1,100,000 will
I be needed to pay the salaries of teach
| ers and $65,000 to pay janitors. The
j total appropriation allowed the school
j department in the budget for 1903-1904
Â¦ was $1,243,000. The board figures that
! next year it will take the sum of
) $1,268,954 alone to pay salaries of teach
1 crs, janitors, members of the board and
j attaches of the school department.
Fo: permanent 'improvements the
Board of Education petitions to be al-
I lowed the turn of $280,000. Of this
j amount $195,961 Is wanted to repair the
J toilet eystems in a number of schools
I which the Health Board threatens to
j declare unsanitary if they are not im-
I proved forthwith.
| The board also asks for $27,500 to buy
: at least fifty portable schoolhouses, in
j order to do away with the renting of
j outside rooms. To equip these schools
an additional sum of $20,000 will be re
quired. The board also wants $3900 to
purchase a lot adjoining the Noe Val
ley School for better playground fa
cilities.
It Is calculated that the sum of $123,
000 will be needed to purchase neces
sary supplies for the use of the school
department. Money Is also asked for
to make necessary repairs to the Ham
j ilton, Dudley Stone, Lafayette and
} Lowell schools. To run the Children's
Playground will consume $7000.
; E. N. Mabrey of .Oakland is the latest
j applicant for principalship of the Girls'
' High School, which Professor Elisha
j Brooks will relinquish as soon as his
'Â¦ successor is decided upon.
The Board of Education yesterday
completed Its statement of the appro
priations which it deems necessary to
conduct the affairs of the public school
department'during the next fiscal yean
The Bureau of Streets was directed
to comply with the request of manu
facturers south of Brannan and Eighth
streets 'that the roadway across Chan
nel street be improved.
City Architect Shea was instructed
to advise the board if a permit has
been granted to make alterations to a
building at 1110 Battery street which
has been condemned by the Health
Board.
The petition of P. Broderick that the
width of the bridge at San Jose and
Mount Vernon avenues be increased to
â¬0 feet at a cpst of $14,000 was taken
under advisement. The board favors
the improvement, as the present bridge
is In bad condition, funerals being fre
quently "stalled" thereon.
The petition filed by the Outdoor Art
League and containing the names of
property owners indorsing the plan to
plant trees in jhe center of Dolores
etreet from Market to Eighteenth at
a cost of $10,000 will be taken up by
the board when it considers the budget
appropriations, it being favorable to
the project. 0
Similar action was taken on the peti
tion of the Sunset District and Ocean
side Improvements clubs to improve H
street as far as Forty-ninth avenue.
The Civil Service Commission noti
.fied that board that it had withheld
approval of the appointment of A. J.
Kosby as building inppector, as he is
not a civil service eljgrible o-n the list
of Inspectors of school buildings. The
commission wants to be informed
wherein the duties of the two positions
differ, and Commissioner Schmits was
delegated to reply to the letter.
The Board of Works yesterday di
rected the Bureau of Engineering to
prepare an amendpd ordinance so as
to pprmit erf the use of asphalts ob
tained by refining California crude pe
troleum oils in the construction of as
rhalt pavements where the cost is as
ressed to private property. Commis
sioner Woodward reported that the "oil
Rsphalt" had been used with satisfac
tory results in this and other cities
arid the prc-ductlon of the natural solid
asphalt for paving purposes has prac
tically ceased in this.State. Woodward
recommended that the ordinance be
amended and that other changes as
to mesh composition of sands and
methods of laying the pavement should
hereafter be made. Favorable action
v as taken on the petition of the Manu
facturers' and Producers' Association.
The board decided. to ask the Super
visors for authority to repave Dupont
street from Montgomery avenue to Val
lejo street at a cost of $1625, Dupont
street from Vallejo to Filbert for $7850
end Vallejo street from Dupont to
Montgomery avenue for $1000.
The board decided to- begin proceed
ings to grade Forty-ninth avenue and
to construct sidewalks on Hancock
etreet nine feet wide.
At this stage of the proceeding At
torneys Cullinan and Hickey, who
represent Public Administrator M. J.
Hynes, who is prosecuting the inquiry,
presented a receipt signed by Marie
Nightengale acknowledging the .re
ceipt of $10,000, the amount she was
supposed to have received under the
terms of the compromise and which
sum is a part of the missing $11,000.
The. receipt was not dated, and it con
tained nothing to show under what
conditions it was signed. Perry said
he knew nothing about it, but pre
sumed that the contestant received
the money if she receipted for it.
Charles Nagle was then placed on
the stand. He was as forgetful as
Perry, though he had less opportunity
to explain. From the time he took the
stand until the order continuing the
case was made he did his best to ex
plain the workings of the Nagle law
offices and the interest therein pos
sessed by himself and James and Pet
er and Peter Jr. After trying to ex
plain for several minutes he gave it
up, simply remarking that it was "a
very peculiar firm."
"What became of the other $4000,
Mr. Perry?" the lawyer was asked.
"Did Miss Nightengale get it?"
"I do not know," said Perry.
RECEIPTS FOR MONEY.
Attorney Perry, who represented
Rickman during the will contest, was
the first witness examined yesterday.
He said he had been met one day on
the. street and told that there was
$11,000 waiting for him at bank. He
remembered going and drawing the
money, but could not remember, he
said, who told him the money, was
there nor at what place the informa
tion was imparted to him. He said he
felt certain that he had Informed
Judge Troutt, in whose court the will
contest was compromised, that the
money had been withdrawn, but de
nied ever having received any infor
mation from Attorney James G. Ma
gulre that he (Maguire) represented
a supposed son of the Kryzyanowskls,
which information would have acted
as a bar to any proceeding tending to
the diminishment of the estate, such
as withdrawing funds from the bank,
for instance. Then Perry explained
what. became of the $11,000. Charles
Nagle, who represented Miss Nighten
gale in the will contest, got $1200;
Peter Nagle,. who helped Charles, got
$2000, and James Nagle, who helped
Peter and Charles, got $2000. Perry
got $1500 and General Salomon, who
helped all the Nagles, got $1800. Per
ry claims that his fee came out of
other funds in the estate.
PERKY TESTIFIES.
"Gentlemen, this looks like a very
bad case," said Judge Kerrigan yes
terday at the hearing of the Inquiry
into the affairs of the estate of Marie
Kryzyanowski, held in his court. He
made the remark ; after hearing the
testimony of Attorneys Charles Nagle
and George Perry, who are accused
of having had a little more to do with
the distribution of the estate
than the law allows, particularly in
the distribution of $11,000 drawn from
the San Francisco Savings Union
shortly after the compromise of the
contest of Mrs. Kryzyanowski's will
waged by Marie Nightengale, who
claimed to be the daughter of the dej
ceased. The testimony of the.attor
neys given yesterday showed that
there is room for considerable suspi
cion that somebody's hands were
placed deep in the Kryzyanowski'
purse, hence the courts terse ' criti
cism. Following his remarks the Judge
made an order continuing the case un
til to-morrow at 3 o'clock, when, un
less the promises of Nagrte and Perry
count for naught. Miss Nightengale,
the "putative daughter of the decedent,
and Charles Rickman, . the residuary
legatee under the will of Mrs. Kryz
yanowski, will be present in court to
explain what has become of the
money.

JW1X COXDOX DESCRIBES'
THE BRITT-CORB12TT FIGHT
CHICAGO, March 30.â President John
Condon of the 'Harlem Jockey Club re
turned Jiome to-day after Ijis. annual
two months' sojourn in California. The
blind turf magnate has never lost the
admiration for a good glove fighter that
marked his.younge|" days when he .pos
sessed his sight and could enjoy a bat
tle. For tjiat matter, he is still enthu
siastic, and [occupied a seat at the ring
side during the Britt-Corbett encounter.
Condon $ays Referee Graney-'s decision
in fa'vo'r of Britt, although probably
wrong, \vas, in his opinion, rendered in
good fajth. -
"Graney;" said he, "was sjmply har
ried away by the tumult caused by
Britt's followers. . They stoo'd on the
tops of chairs toward the end of the
fight and, with one great chorus of
'Britt! 'Britt! Britt!* made more noise
than a dozen football teams combined
could expect to make when giving their
college yells. Mary thought Corbett
would get the decision, but the ma
jority "of the crowd looked for a draw.
They were somewhat stunned . when
Graney declared Britt the winner.
"But," continued- Condon, "there was
no robbery nor underhand work con
nected with the affair. You may think
it strange that a blind man should be
able to tell you so much about the
fight, but my little son, who was at
my side, kept me well posted/and I
could hear the boys lambasting each
other in a manner that tt/ld me there
was surely a fight on. That boy- Britt
must be built like a sunfish or he would
never have I stood the beating Corbett
dealt him around the stomach and kid
neys." â¢ .
vis" of Pomona and Symmes of Califor
nia were tied for second place. Â¦ *
took all his speed to get through. Dane
of Califor&ia was third and Newman,
the only othej Pomona entry, was
fourth. Time, :54 2-5. ,
In the mile run Lyons,* a sophomore,
surprised the* spectators by running
away from such old-timers as Tibbetts,.
Hackley and S Moody. Voerhees, Po-.
mona's only .representative, landed
third place. Hackley being" second.
Time, 4:47 3-5.
Hume of "California won, the two hur-*
die events. In the 120-yarjl event he
arrived at the tape just before Frei.
Noble and McCc-rrrfick of Pomona be
ins third and fourth, respectivelyf
Hume made it in :17 1-5. .In the 220
yard event Hume's time A-as :28 1-5. â¢
Pomona did not show in the 880-*yard
run.* Edwards won this after a des
perate battle through the stretch .with
Mishler and Hanna, who finished sec
on*d and third, respectively. The dis
tance was negotiated in 2:06 4-5.
Sperry <fi'on trie hammer throw, hurl
ing the weight. 141 feet 6 inches. Zach
arias and Ellioit.were second and third,
respectively. Metcalf of Pomona threw
it 133 feet.
Cooley won the high jump- with his
usual ease, Abbott being second and
Boynton third. Cooley ' leaped over a
bar 5 feet S% inches high.
Sperry. Gilmore and Elliott of Cali
fornia finished in the order named in
the shot put. Sperry's best put was 42
feet 7-10 inch. ..: ,j
In the broad Jump SnedJgar repeated
his performance of last Saturday by
Jumping 21 feet 9% inches. Boynton
was second and- Hume of Pomona third.
Wilcox won the pole vault . for Cali
fornia, clearing 11 feet 1% inches. Da-
BERKELEY. March 30.â The Univer
sity of California athletes had a mo
nopoly of th*Â» v.jnnir.g business in com
petition with Pomona College repre
sentatives this afternoon on the Berke
ley oval. Its track men goobled up
ninety of the possible 10S points in
volved. It is not such a bad score,
however, after all. When it is taken
into account that California has the
pick of about 1700 students a-nd Po
mfrna its pick of 300, the spectator feels
it is a good showing.
Pomona's hero is Hendrickson. This
young man is as versatile as a vaude
ville porformpr, and in the three events
In which he started he showed plainly
the kind of stuff of which he is made.
He was third in the lftO-yard dash, but
he kept Abadie and Sncdigar hustling
to keep ahead of him. It was a'close
fit at the end. and th>- time â 10 1-5 sec
onds on a slow track â indicates how
fast they were going.
Hendrickson then landed a first place
In the 2-0-yard dash. Snedigar of Cali
fornia, who won so handily in {he event
last Saturday, could not seem to get
up at all. Newman of Pomona* was
third. Time, ::31-6.
After these hard trials Hendrickson
vac still good for a remarkable show
ing in the 440-yard dash, admitted to
be the most trying of field events. In
this Hendrlckson was just nosed out
by Claude Kern at the tape. It was
nip and tuck with them all the way
round. Kern was pocketed at the last
turn and lost so much ground that it

The pleasant weather was welcomed
by all and the track will soon be in
good, condition. Four' favorites were
bowled Over, Rowena furnishing the big
surprise by getting badly beaten at
odds of 1 to 4.
SHEL.L3IOUXT IX FKOXT.
Vasallo, the Piedmont Stable entry,
was backed from 8 down to 3 to 1 fa
voritism to take the first event and
ran unplaced.* After receding in the
betting from 3 to 5 and 6 Shellmount,
ridden by Holbrook, went out and won
all the way. Vigoroso finished second,
In front of the 20 to 1 shot Blondura.
Maraschino, piloted by Bonner, got
away poorly and was never prominent.
Bob Smith's filly Del Carina, an 3
t6 5. choice, with Larsen in the saddle,
nosed out Hooligan for the two-year
old scramble. Bob o Ragon showed the
way into the stretch but could not
stand the clip. A furlong from hom<-:
the favorite assumed the lead, just
lasting long enough to beat the fast
closing and unlucky Hooligan.
If paet performances count for any
thing Rowena, from the Burns &
Waterhouse stable, looked a "lead
pipe" for the Futurity course number
following. It was the filly's first trip
to the barrier this season, nevertheless
the books held her at the prohibitive
price of 1 to 4. The favorite did not
display, that electrifying burst of speed
.that her admirers expected.
ROWKXA IS UNPLACED.
First race â Six and' a half furlongs; four-
. Bonner was also compelled to take
the worst of the going in the stretch
and Rowena was not placed at the end.
Holbrook, on Harka, had the race in
hand, but overlooked McHannon steal
ins up on the outside with Jack I.itlL?
until too late and lost the decision by
three-fourths of a length. Miss May
Bowdlsh took show honors from tlie
first choice.
Harry Stover's Hulford ca.me out or.
top in a three head finish with Ocyrohe,
an 8 to 5 favorite, and Halnault, mark-
Ing the close of the fifth event. Cross
waite,. on the first choice, led Hainault
into the stretch by a head, but the lat
ter appeared to be going easjest and
looked the best. Before reaching the
paddock "B\z Bill" Knapp joined the
two leaders on the extreme outside with
Hulford and In a fine drive outfinished
both Crosswaite and Buxton* Ocyrohi*
took the place from \he weakly ridden
Hainault.
When beaten last Monday by David
S and Yellowstone Bonner rated
Flaneur, when Charley McCafferty's
horse ruled favorite. In the last race
yesterday, a mile selling affair. Bon
ner hustled Flaneur off in the lead and.
waiting to collect no mail at any of the
crossroads, led from start to finish.
Possart, the 6 to 5 favorite, ran third,
behind Boutonniere.
Maraschino was always a very clever
horse on a heavy track, for which rea
son he was steadily supported to win
the opening race. Bonner early got him
lost in the discardâ not an unusual
thing, j '
ENTRIES FOR TO-DAY.
Peter, the Patriarch, of Oakland
steered his 1904 collection of tossers to
Eighth street yesterday for the first
time this year. It was the initial trip
of many of them to the south side park,
yet they made themselves quite at
home, committing errors, making runs
and occasionally catching fly balls and
stopping the hot ones. Anyhow, they
won, and that was all Peter was think
ing of. Score: Oakland, 8; San Fran
cisco, 5.
The victors fielded like toads and
acted altogether like a bunch of tramps
for a few innings. But when they
started in to wallop that ball there was
nothing to it." They piled' up fifteen
hits against two for the natives, and
this tells the tale of Hank's defeat. Be
sides, the Harris layout was to the bad
sdme, Massey and Leahy being laid up,
young Downing and Hanson playing in
their places. .
Peter's charges look good. The old
gentleman has bunched a strong team,
and if everything breaks right he will
be a headliner, sure. Julie Streib is
back again at first. Shafley, the second
baseman, plays with the grace and
finish of a prima donna. Devereaux
and Francks look about the "same. In
the outfield Ganley, the new. man in
right, is a sticker who can stick. Dun
leavy's record is known to every fan,
and young Kruger looks better than
ever.' The pitching staff is said to a
good one, so there is no reason why
Oakland should not go some this sea
son.
Whittridge, who pitched for them
yesterday, was stingy enough about al
lowing hits, but his control was bad,
atid he could hot field at all. Then his
support was so bad that no one could
figure on Ills ability to shine on the
slab. Meany and Waldron were the
only two locals who could souse him
safely. Each scored a hit, and that: did
the home team for the day. i
Dunleavy was the boy who lined
'em out for Oakland. In the fifth, with
the score 3 to 0 against his team and
the bases all occupied, "Dun" dis
patched a dazzler that soared away
over Waldron's head and 'alighted in
Â¦ back of the flagpole. Everybody came
in and the score was ttten a tie. It re
mained so till the seventh, when San
Francisco got two on the. bags on a
walk and an error by Streib. 3>Ieany
smashed the sphere safely to left and
two came through for the locals.
The Oaklanders filled the racks acjain
in the seventh, and again Dunleavy itd
Â¦ the nobie with the club. He put the
leather over second this time and ti*>d
up the score again. Oakland took an
other lease of life in the last round and
'brought in three tallies. The home
stickers were all in when it 'came their
turn to do things, so the game ended
8 to 5. The score:

District Attorney filed an. Information
against him charging him with an as*
sault with a deadly weapon with In

filing: he had not been legally commit

charged against him. The motion was
denied and an appeal w&f taken to the
Supreme Court. -"Â¦
The Supreme Court , held ( thÂ»t the

The Henry Oowtll Lim*? and Cement
Company, in December of last year,
prevailed upon Mannix to sign an
agreement to use only .its iim*-. the
company agreeing to furnish him, until
December of this year, lime at ?1 25 a
barrel. Mannix agreed "not to buy, or
to agree to buy. or to ajree to use"
any other lime than the plaintiff's*.
After ijecember. 190$, the plaintiff was
to provide Mannix with lime at the
lowest market price. j-Wvided it did
not go below $H) ceftts per barrel, lh
which event it was optional with the
company to sell the defendant lime.
If the plaintiff declined to sell lime to
the defendant for leas than that
amount he might purchase elsewhere
until plaintiff notified hiir. that it would
sell him lime "at the srevaiKng price.
In this event defendant was to again
purchase lirrie exclusively from *the

as long as the plaintiff sold at e the
prevailing market price. The contract

ship oi the disputed strip of territory,
which, by the way, Ls on Mrs. Joyce's
>*ide of the feÂ»icc. As tsie wom^n holds
the land, the court opined that the
most reasonable procedure Mr. -'Hanson
could folhpw would be to bring suit
against her in a tribunal for the ad
judication of such cases established and
maintained. In the matter of the as
sault complained of by Hanson, " the
testimony showed that there was'prov
ocation for it, and tlÂ»at the conduct of
the Hansons tcwartl the defendant had
not been entirely above reproach, so
dismissal was ordered.
Ocean View's populace was largely
represented yesterday in tho court of
Judge Cabaniss, where Mrs. Roxana
Joyce, an aged woman, etood accused
t/f having assaulted the wife of Asa
Hanson, carpenter, by striking her with
a switch detached from a green bay
tree. 5fany neighbors of the contend
ing parties were there to testify, and
the majority Â»Â»â¬Â¦ those called to the
stand turned the tables so completely
that Mrs. Joyce was acquitted.
TliÂ« trouble between the Hansons and
the Joyces originated in a dispute as
to the proper location of the line divid
ing their respective lots.. Each side to
the controversy claims ownership of
a narrow strip of land, and Mrs. Joyce
averred that Hanson repeatedly or
dered her off her own t property and
iliat Mrs. Hanson boxed little Miss
Joyce's ears to enforce a similar con>
mand. It was ' to protect her child,
Mrs. Joyce added, that she applied the
switch to Mrs. Hanson.
Then came a procession of/wltnessea
to prove that the Hansons, and the
head of that house in particular, were
undesirable neighbors. One tvoman,
Mrs. McDonald, swore that â¢ nhe had
heard. Hanson orally abuse Mrs. Joyce
so shamefully that the witness Selt like
weeping, and that she considered her
self Justified in lending to Mrs. Joyce
a pistol to protect herself in the Â»:ven*

PROF. LIVINGSTONE'S readings are like
a living page of Flammarion's treatises that
is so electrifying the world to-day. HE IS
XO IMITATOR. His work Is upon original
lines: PURE THOUGHT. CLEAR VISION.
He TELLS YOU WHAT YOU DESIRE TO
KNOW, AND WORKS IN THE OPEN
LIGHT, AND IS AS CONSPICUOUS FOR
ITS WONDERFUL OCCULT ANALYSIS AS
IT IS FOR ITS ORIGINAL EXPRESSION
A.XI) VIVID TRUTHFULNESS. -
A test reading is not a life reading. When
you call on- PROF. L1VIXGSTOXE he will
give you a full life reading for $1. A test Is of
little value when the mind Is troubled â you
need mere substantial aid and advice. This Is
Just what PROF. LIVINGSTONE gives you
when you call on him for a first-class clair-
voyant reading. He asks you no questions,
hut tells you what you wish to know.
He dees not mention all the ills and mis-
fortunes you are heir to. You are acquainted
with the- facts in your case. Let PROF.
LIVINGSTONE analyze the matters that are
- troubling you, find the cause of trouble and
suggest the remedy.

TO OPEN CAN ON TOP. Force point of bar into center of top of unsealed or smooth end of can.
Bend over until the bar is parallel with the top of can. Set point ot lower blade on top ot can at whatever
"distance from edge the opening is desired. Press down handle until blade penetrates the tin. Then pull
gently toward you, holding the can tightly in the other hand. (To get best result hold can by top). "*'
TO OPEN CAN FROM SIDE. Remove label from can. Force point into exact center of top. Bend
over until bar rests on edge of can. Set point of cutting blade against side of can. always at left of side
seam, with lever perpendicular. Press down on lever, which will force side blade into can. Hold can tisrhtlv
by top with other hand and cut same as when cutting top. In cutting top off always let bottom of bar rest
and run evenly around edge of can to insure even, regular cut. If the side blade comes out while cutting, or
cuts in too far and stops, it is because you have not inserted point of bar in exact center of can. In this case
throw up lever, readjust blade and continue cutting until blade reaches opposite side of seam. vÂ»hen top can
be lifted or broken off altogether. Do not be afraid to grasp can firmly by the top.

his petition on the fact that Sweeney,
during the second trial of the damage

ferred in open court, and in hearing of
the Jury, to the fact that at the first

Abraham Locker, who gives his occu
pation as a canvasser and his birth
place as Philadelphia, was arrested
yesterday morning in the' Sunset dis
trict by Officer O'Callahan and charged
with disturbing the peace, it is be
lieved by the police that Locker is one
of the men who have been working the
bay cities, representing themselves as
Catholic priests and attempting to dis
pose of cheap lithographs at exorbitant
prices. Officer O'Callahan is particu
larly incensed against Locker, as he
claims the man grossly insulted his
wife when she refused to buy a cheap
chlxjmo. He tells his story as folio we:
"Tuesday afternoon a man represent
ing himself to be a priest called at my
home, and as we are expecting a new
priest in that district my wife 'readily
admitted him. After talking pleasant
ly for a few minutes he exhibited a
couple of cheap prints, for which he
demanded $2 50. My wife refused to
buy them, and he called her vile
names. Yesterday morning I found
him operating in the same neighbor
hood and placed him under arrest."
Detective Wren says that a man
claiming to be a priest and giving the
name of Tracy visited his home yester
day and succeeded in disposing of a
two-bit lithograph of the Holy Family
for $4. '

The British ship Halewood. which has been
making a long voyage from Antwerp, appeared
off the heads yesterday In company with the
Italian ship Caterlna Accame. but It was after
dark before the windjammers made port. The
Halewood left Antwerp 171 days ago. The
Accame is out 151 days from Swansea.

Although still quoted at 80 per cent
there will be a truce in Lamorna specu
lation until Lloyds in London takes
action on this latest report. M. A.
Newell yesterday cabled full details and
will take no more Lamorna money until
he receives instructions from London.
It is thought the rate will be dropped
to less than 50 per cent, In which event
those that bought at 90 will be abie
to sell out at a neat profit. It is many
months since the uncertainty of a ves
sel's fate created such excitement as
has been stirred up by the reports per
taining to the Lamorna. . '&
,The effect of all these reports was
to send the rate of reinsurance on the
Lamorna to the topnotch, 90 per cent.
The men of this city who play over
dues invested heavily on the Lamorna's
chances of safe arrival at her destina
tion. So much was wagered that the
odds weakened and under pressure of
the play the rate dropped .to 85 per cent.
Now comes a report from the schoon
er W. H. Smith, which. has arrived at
Redondo from Clallam. The W. H.
Smith, at noon of March 7, sighted a
ship forty miles west-northwest of St.
George Reef. The schooner was about
five miles astern of the ship at 4 p. m.
The ship was painted lead color and
had six topgallant yards and no royals.
The captain of the W. H. Smith says
the vessel was the Lamdrna. He and
his crew are familiar with the British
ship and he is sure of her identity. St.
George Reef is near Crescent City and
sbme 400 miles south of where tho
wreckage was reported on the Van
couver Island coast.
Another report of the British ship
Lamorna was received yesterday and
the rate of reinsurance on the vessel
was reduced to 80 per cent. The La
morna left Tacoma thirty-three day3
ago for Queenstown. Wreckage, with
which "floated a bundle of letters be
longing to the Lamorna's mate, is said
to have been found a few r days later
near the shores of Vancouver Island.
A subsequent report told of the wash
ing ashore of boats bearing the La
morna's name. Bedding and pieces of
a deckhouse were found. A shattered
lifeboat from the ship was picked up
at sea by the steam schooner Allianc?.
Then came a weird tale from the Ger
man ship Artemis, which had sighted
the Lamorna and whose officers knew
from the way the Britisher steered that
there had been a mutiny on board and
that all hands tftid been drowned.

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
United States District Judge de Ha
ven yesterday handed down an opin
ion awarding $500 to the crew of the
United States collier Justin for sav
ing $40,000 worth of property, mo3tly
bullion, from the wreck of the United
States auxiliary cruiser Yosemite % The
cruiser was caught In a hurricane in
the harbor of Guam on November 14,
1900, and was carried out to sea. The
crew of the Justin followed her and
transferred her cargo to the collier.
There were twenty-two members of
the crew claiming salvage, but Judge
de Haven decided that Herman E.
Nielsen, Thomas P. Nielsen and "Wil
liam Wyld were not residents of the
Northern District of California at the
time the libel was filed and the court
consequently was without jurisdiction
so far as they were concerned.
The court directed that the $500
should be divided among the nineteen
remaining members in proportion to
the monthly wages received by each.
Among other things in his opinion
Judge de Haven said:
It Is cot disputed that personal property of
the United States on board of a vessel for
transportation from one port to another la lia
ble to a lien for salvage services In saving: the
property, and that the master and crew of one
vessel may recover salvage for services ren
dered . the master and crew of another vessel
belonging to the same owner. I don't think the
service was of a very high order of merit. In
deed, in my opinion, there was very little, if
any, personal danger connected with Its per
formance.
Peter Seculovich addressed the board
on the subject, remarking that damages
to property on Islais Creek amounting
in the aggregate to 53,000,000 had accu
mulated since 1878. ;
Chief Engineer Lot D. Norton was
directed by the board to prepare plans
j for four piers to be constructed at the
j new seawall south of the Pacific Mail
dock. Each pier Is to be 800 feet long
and 120 feet wide. Two of the new
â¢wharves will be double-deckers. The
Pacific Mail Company desires the use
of the four piers. After the construc
tion of the first two piers the present
! Mail dock will be torn out to facilitate
| further extension of the seawall.
: With reference to repeated requests
j by Peter Seculovich for some action by
i the Board of Harbor Commissioners
( toward deepening the channel and pro
! motion *of navigation of Islais Creek,
! the board adopted a resolution post
| poning work until certain engineering
; plans could be adjusted by the City En
: gineer and the chief engineer of the
i commission.
At the meeting of the State Board of
Harbor Commissioners yesterday the
question of opening the news stand
privileges to public competition was
decided in the affirmative. Pending the
award to the highest bidder. Commis
sioner Spear moved that the rent of
the space now occupied by Messrs.
Foster and Orear in the waiting roonn
of the Southern Pacific and Atchison,
Topeka and Santa Fe railroad com
panies, In the San Francisco Ferry
Depot building be fixed at $1500 a
month and the offer of $1500 a month
for same contained In Foster & Orear 1 a
communication of January 20. 1904, be
accepted, said rent to commence March
31, 1904, and continue during the pleas
ure of the board. Commissioner Klrk
patrick seconded the motion. The two
Commissioners present voted in the
affirmative, and the statement was
made that Commissioner Mackenzie,
who could not be present, desired to be
recorded as voting aye.
The secretary was then instructed to
prepare an advertisement inviting pro
posals for the privilege. The attorney
was requested to advise with the secre
tary as to the form of the advertise
ment. It is understood that this pro
ceeding is in line with the course
recommended in Judge Seawell's recent
decision.

. Lower prices at Liverpool and rain through
out the greater portion of the Southwest
caused an easy tone in wheat at the opening
July being a shade to %Â©%c lower at 87% to
S79SC. The pit crowd was generally bearish
on the favorable crop news from the winter
wheat belt. In consequence there was llttls
demand at the start, i The market became still
weaker on liberal offerings from commission
housee. July declined to SÂ«%c before any
support was encountered. Strength : in corn
soon beran to be felt In the wheat pit, how
ever, the market gradually becoming firmer.
Prices advanced more rapidly : when a rumor
was circulated that a leading long was buying
heavily of old July wheat, purchases of half
a 'million bushels being credited, to- this
operator. Under the influence; of -the buying
ascribed to him there, was. a scramble among
earlr'Bellers .to repurchase 'wheat. ;Â¦. The de
mand was increased by the bullish cash situa
tion here, aa well as In â¢ the Northwest and
Southwest. Sales of . cash Â¦ wheat were * made
here at advanced prices and the caFh demand
everywhere was said to be unusually good. -X
sale of 100.000 . bushel* to Texas millers at
7. cents over export price was reported " from
Oalveston. Â¦ An /offset to the strength -in the'
cash market was the prevalence of .'raid In the
Southwest. As the session drew near the close.,

The Orange market showed more tone for
some little while back, as the warm sunny
weather encouraged local dealers to operate
freely and a goo<l demand was noted for ship
ment to Pugvt. Sound ports and to Honolulu.
The damand was still confined chiefly to low
priced fruit and such stock did better, both In
the open market and in -the auction -rooms.
Desirable sizes of extra fancy stock, that is,
06a and 112s, were held at $2 25 per box, but
for the general 'market $2. was considered an
extreme figure. . The auction sale was well at
tended and the bidding was brisk throughout.
Six cars were sold as follows: Extra fancy
$1EOÂ«2; ordinary rancy,^.$l 60<Sl 73; choice",
$1 30@l 40; standard. 75c$r$l. The recent ad
vance in prices of Tangerines drew in. large
suppli&J and prices eased off again. The other
Citrus fruits were fairly active at unchanged
rates. Bananas were plentiful and moved,
freely at the previously quoted rates.- '
A, fair movement was noted In Apples, but
supplies were ample and prices had no quotable
variance. A car of the Btn Davis variety that
came In from Oregon some days ago was mar
keted at $1@1 25 per box. ...
APPLESâ $2<g2 25 per box for extra fancy,

The Poultry market- continued firm - and
'active, wlthlarge stock particularly in demand.
Old Roosters and small Broilers continued to
drag, but were pretty well cleaned up at the

a better demand for young Pigeons and they
wtre quoted higher. No more Western Poultry
came, and It was expected that there would
be none available before Friday. Game was in

NEW YORK. March SO.â There was prao
ticaJly no limit to the surmise and conjecture
â¢rbicb profefsional Wall street Indulged Itself
to-day over . the hidden significance of the
pccutnulation of Union Pacific /stock, which
has been the mystery in the market now for
many days. Tht favorite hypothesis at the
outret tc-day was that the accumulation was
in the Interest of the : St. Paul Interests, and
It v.as asserted with every appearance of con
viction that an " official statement/* would
*li<irily bÂ« fcrthcomins from the St. Paul
authorities that they had secured 200,000
shares of Union Pacific. What cave plaus
ibility to this rusior was the admitted anxiety
felt hy St. Paul Interests at the time of thÂ«
Burlington purchase over the comparative
isolation in which the St. Paul system would
be left. The making of surveys looking to
extension to the Pacific and the proposition
for the irsue of $25,000,000 additional St. Paul
stock are matters of public record. It Is a
matter of common notoriety also that relations
between St. Paul and Union Pacific In the in
terchange of traffic and of common ownership
of stock ?Â»re already close. But the assump
tion that telf-protectlon necessitates such
action by St. Paul presumes a similar neces
sity on the cart of all the Pacific and trans
continental railroad systems for a control of
the through facilities from a trunk line termi
nus to the Pacific Coast. Hence, the rise in
St. Paul was loelcally accompanied by
strength in Atchison, Missouri Pacific and
others situated In like manner, and floods of
new rumors extended the principle Illustrated
in St. Paul's . supposed purchases of Union
Pacific. One variation of the rumor was that
the buying was for the Gould interests rather
than for St. Paul. The enormous capital re
quired for such, an interchange of ownership
; did rot recrr. to affect the credence given to
rumcr?, although It will be remembered that
the avowed purpose of the Northern Securities
dÂ»vice wa? to make less onerous the enormous
holdings of Northern Paciflc which had been
accumulated in the contest for the control of
that system. Other factors had only a small
inflvence on the rise In prices. Those who
sold United States Steel preferred on the fear
that the dividend is to be reduced seemed to
feel reassured to-day, and that stock recovered
Its yesterday's decline and held better than
the "average. Speculative confidence over the
reliability of some of the stories current to
account for tbÂ» rise was decidedly impaired
I as the day progressed and during the final
I hour thÂ» level of prices touched represented
a cancellation of the best part of the earlier
gains. Th<?Â« persistent pressure on Union Pa
cific and Southern Pacific, which was Ignored
during the forenoon, gained additional impres
siveness. Thope two stocks ranged below yes
terday'* last prices throughout. Union Pa
ilflc'P 1ofs on the day !s a point and South
ern Pacific Is -li lower. The market closed

The weekly circular of Somers & Co. iayÂ«:
"Last week showed a total of 21C0 tons of
Hay arriving, but the week.' ending" to-day
shows a â¢ total of 2700 tons, an" increase of WK)
tons. ' This ? DUdden :â¢Â¦ increase was occasioned;
by a rush order from the Government for about
1000 tons, of which about 700 tons was taken,
the transoort . Dix having Just sailed with
about this quantity. From this time on there
will probably be comparatively light receipts
again, for ! the local "demand is rather qutet
and it Is fast Â¦ becoming obvious that country
stocks must bo handled Judiciously in order
to last us through.
! "Although croo prospects - at the .present
writing are-most favorable. yetMf we do not
have pleasant weather shortly much damage
may be wrought because of floods and rotting
seed. The longer the rains continue the later
the crop will be delayed, and we believe thi3
season will need new Hay Just as soon as we
can get . tt, -. .--.
"Nothing new has developed from the Orient,
although many new inquiries have come Id
during the past week. Thus far practically
nothing has resulted except the sending of
samples both for a possible Japanese and Kus
sian- demand. -...
"A varied assortment of Hay Is being offered
at" present., most all of which Is good quality.
Tame oat. Hay is perhaps in rather light supply
and alfalfa Is corMng in but sparingly, but on

what they need." â¢-. ,

caused by getting, in the way of a

slight annoyance and /he remained on
the field until the end of the exercise.
Â¦ Following . the problem movements,
Major Bigelow held a . review on the
links. This .was a spirited affair and
.went off with .apparently great snap
and precision. ' Major Bigelow said,
however, that the recent heavy drills
had takeru.up so much time that the
troopers were a little bit rusty in cere
monies, but they certainly make up for
any defect In this line by the splendid
work they do in the problem exercises.
The day was absolutely perfect and
the crowd not only enjoyed the maneu
vers of the cavalry, but they also had a
grahd view of the ocean, the Farallon
Islands and a number of ships under
full sail in. the offing.
During lulls in the activity, of the
contending! forces the little children
rolled and Jumped about on th4 beauti
ful greensward of the putting greens,
while a legion of email boys had a
sham battle of their own, using one of
the hunkers for . bulwarks. A large
number of ladies were on the scene and
divided their attention between watch
ing the troopers and picking huge
bunches of golden California poppies.

was dispatched to Major Bigelow, giv
ing him this information, but the writ*
ing was done bo hurriedly that it con
fused the commanding officer, ..who fin
ally-decided that h"is reserves were
wanted to. the left and sent them there.
In the meantime Lieutenant Rubottom
with hi? troop had succeeded in enter
ing the post without being; observed
and had taken a position 'â¢ behind the
brow of the hill near the Marine Hospi
tal.- From this point he sent out a pa
trol of five men who succeeded in mak
ing a detour of the field and located the
position of the defending army. While
this was going on he sent 'out' a platoon
to make a demonstration to attract !t he
attention of the outposts' from his
troops, in which he was -eminently
successful. In 'the meantime his patrol
returned, and after firing a few shots
at the defending . cossacks he ordered
his men to retreat, and as they were
leaving post they" were, followed by
troop l'i, under command of Captain
John Â¦ R. Christian, who poured a hot
lire after them, resulting In the sup
posed wounding of several. These were
taken to an improvised hospital camp,
where they were treated and sent from
the field in ambulances. Some were
supposed to have broken legs and arms,
and were treated accordingly. .
The problem exercise of the Ninth
Cavalry, which took place at the Pre
sidio yesterday on the grounds lying
between First avenue and the Pacific
Ocean, gave satisfaction, to the troop
ers themselves and instruction and
amusement to a big crowd of onlookers,
who at times came near interfering
with the maneuvers, so closely did they
press on the scene of action.
The- problem was as follows: The
garrison is supposed . to be guarded by
the b!ue force, composed of Troops I,
L ami "M, under command of. Major
}?igelow, while the brown force, com
posed of Troop K, under . command
of Lleuterant k. H. Rubottom,-repre
senting the attacking army, is expected
to enter from the south side of the post,
ascertain the position and .situation of
the. outposts of the defending troops
and then retreat and renbrt to the in
vading army the situation of affairs. :
In this Lieutenant Rubottom was
successful. ' '.'.'.'Â¦' :

conspiracy is referred wholly to the
District, and the acts alleged to ha\e
been committed in California and Ore
gon are set forth simply as jovert acts
in furtherance of that conspiracy. The
only crime charged Is the conspiracy to
fyist bad titles on the Government in
exchange for good ones." Â¦Â£â¢Â¦â¢_.
The direct contradiction between the
two veteran lawyers quickly involved
all the counsel on each side, and the
Commissioner was at length, compelled
to quiet the noisy, albeit good-humored
debate.- Garrett W. McEnerney joined
Wheeler in arguing that the,indictment
charged a crime committed partly In
the States named.' This the Govern
ment attorneys denied. Wheeler con
cluded In part as follows: *':
The act oj 1SS4 provides that "the criminal
court of the District of Columbia shall have
jurisdiction of all crimes and mtsdemmnors
committed in said District and not- lawfully
trUblÂ« In any oth#r court and which are re
quired by law to be prosecuted by indictment
or information." The language of this act
points to crimes alleged to have been com
mitted, partly In the District and partly in a
State, Â¦ with the intent that in Â»uch cases
trial shall always be in the State courts.* It
shows that the ' District has no jurisdiction
over the crime charged he/*-
PUGH'S REPLY.
The burden of answering Wheeler
fell to Pugh, who is an attorney of the
Interior Department, and who was
heard for the first time in the case.
He quickly became involved in a con
troversy with McEnerney, and after
each side had got itself pretty well
tangled up with legal catch questions
the San Francisco lawyer retired from
the contest of wits' with the remark:
"Doubtless his Honor will have to
bring*a regiment down from the Pre
sidio to keep us all in order." The main
points of Pugh's plea follow:'
We have never admitted that this indictment
could be tried in California, because it charges
a conspiracy only in the District of Columbia
and the commission of an overt act there which
completed the crime. The allegation of otlwr
overt acts committed in this State, such as
Dimond's letters written at San Francisco and
Vlsalia. does not affecf the jurisdiction of- the
Supreme Court of the District. The conspiracy
alleged is not what whs done here or in Ore
gon, but the agreement to exchange bad land
titles for good ones, and this agreement was
made in Washington.
. Mr. Wheeler's whole argument amounts to
nothing, because he misunderstands that act
of 1894. There is a later act, thÂ» Judicial
Code of the District, adopted in 1902. which
provides in section 61 that the "Suprf me Court
of the District shall have the same powers
and Jurisdiction as the Circuit courts of the
United States in the several States." and in
section S3 it defines the criminal Jurisdiction
of this court In specific terms as follows: â¢"The
trial of crimes and misdemeanors committed
in the District of Columbia shall be in the
Supreme Court for the District holding a
special term as a criminal court." The sec
tion which Mr. Wheeler cited, referring to
offenses ' "triable In any other court." means,
not the courts of a State, but the police
courts of the District, which try offenses with
out indictment. > .
TITLES NOW -HELD UP.
Pugh paid his compliments to Me-
Enerney'a argument that the Govern
ment had not been defrauded because,
as the defense claims,- a man holding
a fraudulent title to lands in a forest
reservation has a right to relinquish
that title and get a good title to land*;
outside the reservation. "This amazing
assertion," said Pugh, "gives away the
whole defense. It is not good In law.
and if the defendants think It will hold
in the case of the rellnquishments they
have now on file in the Interior Depart
ment, covering hundreds of thousands
of acres, they will find themselves mis
taken. The Government has evidence
of. the fraud in these titles and- pro
poses to put a stop to their practices.
Even if California and Oregon are in
different to the robbery ol their school
lands the Government will refuse titles
obtained from these States by falsÂ«?
entries,"
The day's argument closed with a
brief plea from Heney. This morning
the defense will be heard in reply, and
then it will be up to the commissioner
to decide whether Hyde and Dimond
shall be heFd. If his ruling is against
them. they may then put on witnesses
or attack his decision by habeas corpus
proceedings. An intimation given by
McEnerney yesterday that the defense
would have witnesses present In court
to-day was accepted as indicating that
the' former course would be followed,
but the shrewd attorneys for the de
fense have /carefully concealed their,
plan of campaign and may be expected
to do whatever they believe will give
the Government the fewest Dolnt3
against them.
The Seventeenth-street police sta
tion was notified yesterday of a sad
case of destitution at 3921 Folsom
street and action was at once taken by
Captain Anderson to alleviate the suf
ferings of the mother and provide food
and shelter for heV four young chil
dren, r,. .">..-
The mother is Mrs. Helen Dettner,
a widow, who came" here from Blos
Â¦vrorth. Pa., in the hope that the in
vigorating ilimate of California would
give her strength to work. for the sup
port of herself and children. She has
been it sufferer from rheumatism for
years. Her husband, who was em
ployed in a tannery in Blosworth. died
three years ago, before the birth of her
youngest child.
She struggled along in the effort to
earn enough to support the family, but
her ailment prevented her. She was
advised to come to this State, so she
sold her bolotigings and arrived here
about a month ago. She secured rooms
at 3921 Folsom street, but as she was
unable to search for work, owing to a
severe attack of rheumatism, her lit
tle stock of money soon ran out and
ehe was left destitute.
Captain Anderson sent Mrs. Dettner
in the .patrol wagon to the City and
County Hospital and the four children
vere sent to the City Prison and
placed in charge of the matron till
they can be pent to the YoutTis' Direc
tory. The oldest thild is Sigm^ind, 13
years of age. who is ;i brijrht boy and
he cried when he found himself and
his two brothers' and his little sister
in the prison. The other children are
Edmund. 8 years of nge; Stephen, 7,
and Mary 2 years 6 months. They
were as hungry as wolves and Mary's
first cry when she entered the matron's
room was for a slice of bread and but
ter. Her wants were speedily sup
plied. All the children were neatly
dressed and longed for their mother.
They have neither friends nor rela
tives in this city.
The attorneys . on each side of the
land fraud case yestfrday came into
their second wind. As a result of a
new, line of - attack on the indictment
opened by. Charles S. Wheeler of
counsel for the defense the lawyers are
still talking, and United States Com
missioner Heacock has not yet had an
opportunity to announce whether he
will hold the defendants, Hyde and
Dimond, for trial before the Supreme
Ccurt of the District of Columbia.
Wheeler made a strong and plau&ible
argument ' against j the jurisdiction of
that court,, notwithstanding the Com
missioner's disinclination to go into the
question of jurisdiction, and the dis
cussion of the points' raised was not
completed when the hour for adjourn
ment, arrived. -
TILT.' BETWEEN COUXSKL.
Wheeler opened by. declaring that the
Commissioner had been too modest in
holding that J he had no right to ques
tion, the jurisdiction of the court. He
saidi among other things:
Your . Honor fai entitled to pan* upon the
jurisdiction of any court or Judge, whethfr he
be the Chief Justice of the Suortme Court or
only, a Justice of the Peace. My. client has
rights which the law platts In your custody.
I propose to show that, by express statute, the
courts of the District of , Columbia have no
Jurisdiction to" try an accusation that can be
tried â¢ in the court* of * State. Under the
constitution of th" United States a man must
be triwi In the -S tat 1 wherÂ« his crime iÂ« al
legal to have been committed. Not so with
the District uf Columbia. This trial might be
transferred from Washington to Sltka. The
Federal constitution does not rovfrn terri
tories, and it is an outrage to say that a man
can be taken- across the country Tor trial in
a mere district 'whvre no State constitution
obtains-. and- where Judets hold, not for life,
but atthe- wlUoi the President.
A. B.' Pugh", one. of the Government
attorneys from" "Washington, corrected
Wheeler,' â¢pointing, out that under the
act governing the district, the Judges
do hold for, life. _. Francis J. Heney,
special counsel for the prosecution, also
objected, declaring Wheeler had in
sinuated that the Judges at Washington
are corrupt because they are appointed
by a corrupt President. This roused
Wheeler's ire. Said he:'
I .utterly repudiate the sucsestion. There
Is no man In the country who has a higher
respect for Theo4orf Roosevelt and his splen
did integrity of character than have I. But
there is nothing to prevent Congress from
pasMnpr a law that these defendants shall be
tried in Alaska or the Indian Territory. > If
they committed a crime in the' District, they
are not protected by any constitutional guar
anty of trial there. This indictment, how
ever. 1 charges that they committed a crime
partly In the District and- partly In the States
of California and Oregon. Hence we contend
that under the constitution they must be tried
In one of these States and not in the District.
"You are ...mistaken," Interrupted
Heney. "The Indictment charges that
the crime of conspiracy was commit
ted only in the District of Columbia.
Doubtless it will be possible to indict
them of conspiracy in these States also,
but we have not as yet done so. This
