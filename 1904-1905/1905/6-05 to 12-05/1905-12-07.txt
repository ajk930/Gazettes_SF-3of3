Nationalists at Dublin { Take an
Uncompromising Attitude.
DUBLIN. Dec 6.â The Nationalist con
vention, so- far as to-day's proceedings
are concerned, resolved Itself into an un
compromising home rule meeting, l Reso
lutions were passed denouncing the pres
ent government of Ireland,, outlawing
William O'Brien and his supporters un-
Irss they signed the party pledges, ex
pressing disbelief in the promises of the
Liberals Â«nd pledging absolute. support to
John Redmond as leader of the Irish
parliamentary party. The Moderates were
howled down and their speakers forced
to leave the platform.
The convention also passed airesolution
condemning, the proposed "conference of
the supporters of Lord Dunraven, Thomas
W Russell, Timothy M. Healy^and John
Dillon on the ground that it would be
interpreted as an abandonment of the
claim for home rule. -^SH
The convention will continue-to-mor
row, but there â¢is no evidence ", that the
incoming Liberal Government can, expect
more support from the Nationalists in the
next Parliament than tfce Unionists have
rrceivtd, unless Sir Henry 'Campbell-
Bannerman pronounces for: home rule.
The direction* to the leaders and the
resolutions passed at to-day's \u25a0 : session
mean continued opposition to the Govern
ment'until absolute home rule has been
granted to Ireland.
Redmond presided. \ He. congratulated

out misadventure were well'out on the
road to 'Hay wards' when the accident
occurred. .Young" McCord, v/who 1 was
driving the machine, had 'it under V ex
cellent ;'; ' Control," as ' he ft slowed down
preparatory to crossing a bridge la
short distance west of the large Meek
orchards: '; As " the j automobile neared
the bridge' approach McCord' turned the
steering * wheel to avoid a 'rut in the
road. As he ; moved the 1 wheel some
thing suddenly went, wrong with the
gearing. "The machine I made* a sudden
swerve, and. before the chauffeur could
regain 'cPntrol ."of it the'automobile had
pounded into a gully at the side of the
road. -. i'. :|
/FEARS GRAVE DISASTER.
"My God, we're gone!" yelled McCord,
as he\tried ,vainly to check the; ma
chine in its careening crash. Through
the . gully it ran; crashing into a fence,
tearing out posts and 'boards, and land
ing in an orchard on its side./. The .girls
and â¢ McCord â¢' were -'-:\u25a0 pitched | out of

struck soft earth, which lessened the
shock considerably. :,The trio ' had ; been
prepared for the spill -and managed to
ayoid-being caughtunder- the big. ma
chine when -it went over, ; carrying 1 the
debris and fencing with it.
.As soon as they had scrambled to their
feet the upset automobilists made'a hasty_
survey of themselves. The young; women
were "' more " or less bruised ' and? consider
ably unnerved by the experience, but had
escaped . serious injury." They were coy-,
ered^with dirt and their garments were
bedraggled " by ,- the ... spill. , McCord â¢ came
out of the accident luckily, ; as did ? his
guests. After the trio had? assured -each
other that they could- dispense with \ im-j

CZAR'S MANCHURIAN TROOPS
MAY MURDER OFFICERS.
ivinevitch rorwards an Urgent
Appeal to St. Petersburg-
Must Have Ships to Transport
Mutinous 1 roops Home.
Spedal Ca"blc to The Call and Â»iv York llrrald. Copyright, ICOS, by the ..
. A"Â«vr York Herald Publishing- Company. \u25a0 \u25a0' .
ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 6-General
Linevitch keeps urging the Governmenl
to hasten the return to Russia of his
troops, whose attitude of Insubordination
is such as to place the lives of their
officers In peril. General LJnevitch says
that unless ships are sent forthwith he
will engage any transports he can .find.
These transports are asking him 300
rubles pÂ«r -man. An English syndicate
a month ago offered a large transport
service- at 7S roubles per head. The Gov
ornment haggled, but since then the ship
ping rate has almost doubled. The same
syndicate to-day asks 130 rubles. The
Government says this is too much.
M^airwhile the vast army in Manchuria
is in a state of mutinous effervescence,
â¢which is liable to result in one of the
biggest scandals the military world has
ever known and compared to which even
those at Sebastopol and Kieff would be as
nothing.
On all sides the same cry is heard,
namely, that Count de Witte's position
is serious-ly shaken, the postal strike be
ing the final straw. It has had such a
tÂ«rrible effect in upsetting commerce and
affairs have _ come to such a point that
private bank's are talking of closing.
Owing to this, the reactionary party is
very much td the fore with strong pow
ers, not the least of which is the Asso
ciation of Land Owners. It is using its
Influence with the Emperor to return to
repression on the severest scale. The
monarch, it is said, lends a willing ear.
An attempt to open the post and tele
graph offices to-day under the protection
of a very strong military force was al
most ludicrous. The public was not de
ceived. Telegrams were taken and paid
for and were sent by train, while there
was a comedy of sorting letters, a few

MASSAGRES IN 171 1QWNS
LONDON, Dec' Câ The secretary of the
cpmnilttee which was appointed by the
re,cent\ conference held here under . the
chairmanship of Lord. Rothschild to take
charge of the distribution of the funds
collected j for the - relief of Jews in Rus
sia said to-night that the committee was
being much hampered by the failure of
telegraphic communication. He said that
the following dispatch had been received
from the traveling commissioners work
inr in Russia:
"Telegraphic communication has been
entirely stopped throughout Russia and
we are without news. We are sending
this to' the frontier. After a personal in
spection we can 'report that the destruc
tion is indescrlbale." Hundreds of shops
have ; been I destroyed and business' is at
a standstill. The damage amounts ;-; to
millions of rubles. Forty thousand per
sons : are affected in Kieff alone." Several
small towns which had" Jewish sections
have been entirely burned and the people
are sleeoine in the fields."
The traveling commissioners â¢ say . that
171 towns have been the scenes of Jewish
massacres. These figures do not include
a number of villages and Siberian towns,
many of which suffered from the anti-
Semitic madness.
Writing from Klefl under date of De
cember 1, the commissioners say that the
town was then in open riot and that fir
ing was continual. The British Consul
had offered to shelter the commissioners.
The secretary said- that up to date
J2.475.000 had been contributed. This sum
includes $1,000,000 from the United States;
$520,000 from Germany and $435,000 from
Great Britain. The sumo! $935,000 had al
ready been remitted to Russia.
The committee, the secretary said,' pro-j.
posed to organize a special system of re~;
lief for. the orphaned children; who woujd;
be removed from Russia -and given into^
the care of Jewish families in other,
countries. This . plan, he ' said, had - re
ceived the indorsement of Uacob H:,Schiff

to Marry Nellie T.
; '. Henry.
To-morrow the jury that has been
sitting in the case will decide whether
or not Miss Nellie" T. Henry is entitled
to damages, as she asserts she Is. from
Millionaire W. F. "Whlttler " for breach
of promise to marry. The evidence
was all in yesterday and argument for
the plaintiff opened.
The, defense rested,, on the theory
that J Whlttler. had never asked " Miss
Henry to^be. his. wife and, that the few
small -presents he gave her were only
the marks of appreciation of a'patle'hl
whose' suffering had" been in' admeasure
alleviated through the ministrations of
a riuree. Miss Henry had rubbed the
venerable Joints .of '. Whittier's arm 3
free of rheumatism and In appreciation
he had sent her. candy at times. " This
was .the explanation' Whlttler gave of
his relations .with Miss Henry.
W. R. â¢\u25a0.Whlttler, 'a son of the defend
ant, corroborated his father, stating
that: the .latter had. never even men
tioned marrying Miss Henry, and that
such a thought* so far as he knew,_ha<l
never entered his father's* mina. \*

her brother, John R. Jarboe. a conspi
cuous rtgurc in the social life of San

moreansâbelong.
Surviving Mrs. Robinson are her hus

ErecUl Dltpatcb to The Call. *
PITTSBURG, Dec 6. â The news from
New York to-night that William Ellis
Corey, president of thÂ« United States
Steel Corporation, has made public a
statement in which he admits irrecon
concilable "differences" between him
self and his wife caused a broad smile
among those who have known of this
affair for weeks . and months. A tele
gram to-day. said that a New York pa
per had reproduced photographs of
Mabelle Gillman and Corey together.
The social ban on President Corey
because of his alleged treatment of his
wife appears to be well denned. It
developed to-day that Mrs. C. M.
Schwab, the wife of- the former presi
dent of the United States Steel Corpora
tion, took it on herself to start the ball
rolling against Corey when they met at
a reception given here at the residence
of President Alva C. Dinkey of the
Carnegie Steel Company some weeks
ago. "It was a reception given in honor
of Mrs. Schwab by Mrs. Dinkey, and
Corey attended.
The story that Corey had arranged to
divorce his wife and wed Mabelle Gill
man, the actress, had been discussed in
social circles for some time, and Mrs.
Schwab. lit appears, was not pleased
that Corey should have come to a recep
tion given her. The president of the
6teel corporation approached' Mrs.
Schwab, but was "greeted with a stony
stare. V
"Mr. Corey, is It true that you in
tend to divorce your wife and marry an
actress?" she was heard by a dozen per
sons to ask the distinguished guest.
His reply was low and not heard by
any save Mrs. Schwab. sS.\- ' '"
_ "If you do this, Ellis, my doors will be
forever closed to you and yours," said
Mrs. Schwab in a voice that rang through
the room.
Mrs. Frank Campbell, mother of Mrs.
Corey, was found at her little home in
Swiss - Valley this afternoon. , From New
York Corey had been quoted as saying
Mrs. Corey "was traveling in the West
with her mother," but Mrs. Campbell
does not know anything about this. She
is a neat, nervous little woman, who feels
keenly the position in, which her daugh
ter has been placed, but says she cannot
talk. !^;; --v>';
"Oh, it's awful, awful, isn't it?" said
she, as she broke down in tears, and that
is all she would say.
It is understood that Mrs. Campbell is
the leader in a movement to have Mrs.
Corey refuse any. financial settlement
from Corey, save that which she may get
in court. , â¢-:*:
In Swiss Valley the story of how Mrs.
Corey sought to reclaim her husband one
year ago, and was rudely repulsed, Is dis
cussed on all sides. , It Is said that Mrs.
Corey came from New York at that. time
and poured her tale of woe in her moth
er's cars. Corey is said to have been
maintaining two places in New .York and
Mrs. Corey gathered all this information.
She went to her husband and told him
that she knew all, but that she was will
ing to forgive and forget, if he would
only come home. But he refused to listen
to her proposition."
COREY ADMITS BREACH.
Says Actions of Himself and Actress
Have Been Proper.
NEW YORK, Dec. 6.â William B.
Corey, president of the United /States
Steel Corporation, made a statement to
day with reference to a report that he
and Mrs. Corey had separated and that
he intended to marry Mabelle Gilxnan,
the actress, after his wife obtained a
divorce. Corey said:
The subject matter of recent publications
personal to myself and some otbeni l-> of such
a painful- character that I have hesitated to
cay anythlns In regard to It, and have per
haps been unjust to myself and to the press
In declininr to admit the whole truth when
questioned. However, In view of ' what haÂ«
been published, I have decided to make a etate
raent which covers the situation. I do this
more to protect the good name of ethers than
my own
Mrs. Corey and I have had disagreements.
Our differences are Irreconcilable. * I have been
Informed and believe she Is residing In Nevada.
She may have contemplated a divorce, and if
the applies for one I shall, not oppose it -if it
Is legally obtained and does not involve me in
any moral turpitude." Whether â¢' she doea or
does net I am In duty bound to provide her a
comfortable support and shall do so. I have
been for a lone time well acquainted with a
lady whose name has been prominently con
nected with mine, but there has not been any
conduct between us of which either of us need
be ashamed. Any suggestion* to the contrary
â¢vrou!d be a great Injustice. Â» . \u25a0 \u25a0

PHILADELPHIA, Dec 6. â President

sistant* to President Cassatt, who J have
been* the chief dispensers of the

One of :the chief traffic' officers of the

"There will.be but one exception to the

gle exception the* Pennsylvania will abso
lutely - discontinue " the issuance j| of "' free
transportation. Even the newspapers are
included in the new order."
"Is .this action by the Pennsylvania 'to
be interpreted â¢as having any significance
as bearing upon- President Roosevelt's
agitation against railroad discrimina
tion?" was,asked. .
"Consideration by the railroads of ways
and means foi overcoming; the pass evil
is older than President Roosevelt's agi
tation against discrimination," was the
answer. "As a matter : of fact; the abo
lition of all- passes was con
templated by the Pennsylvania "Railroad
three years ago. It may be stated," how
ever, that since the agitation" has j become
general, and since the -sentiment' of the
country seems to be distinctly against

FUNDS WIRED
TO AMUNDSEN
Appeal of the Explorer for
3ioney to Assist Expedition
Js Promptly /Answered
Special Dispatch to The Call.
; SKATTLE, Dec. B.â Ronald: Amundsen,
the first man in . history, to succeed *In
making : the Northwest passage J from
east to west, is still at Fort Egbert,
Alaska, waiting for/ an answer to the
message he last, night sent to Nansen in
Chris tiania. His appeal for funds and
assistance has borne fruit, the . Post-In
telllgencer,: which was first f to make the
announcement, ..wiring, him funds. The
Norwegians of this city also wired money.'
From â¢ the" fact that Amundsen and his
expedition ,- are* in winter quarters near
the mouth of McKenzie River, his object,
which he made public before leaving
Christlanta, In May, 1903, has been ful
filled. â¢ In an articles published â¢in March,
1903. V these excerpts - are taken to show
what Amundsen ; hoped to accomplish:
\u25a0 He ' proposes to start north during the early
summer, stopping at Codhaven, Greenland, for
dogs.
â¢Amundeen's first ' base \u25a0 station will : probably
be la the . vicinity of North Somerset. In Leo
pold harbor, from which he hopes to- send news
of hU work In 1904 by means of whale hunters.
There h.3 pioposes to make absolute magnetic
observations and also operate his self-reglster-
Jns instrument* for a time. From this base
station \u25a0 he likewise proposes to make < sledge
trips; on \ which magmetic observations will be
made. : In the summer, of lOCS he may locate
his ba3-2 station on - King - William Island and
again set . up hfs . self- registering instruments.
The following cummer, 11KSC, he will attempt
.to locate his base at Herschel Island and open
communication with Fort McPherson of the
Hudson ' Bay Company. "; His, return trip will be
made by way of , Bering Strait and he proposes
to stop at ' Sitka and maK* his final observa
tions there â¢at the :Unltcd -States" Coast and
Geodetic ! Survey; Magnetic Observatory for the
determination of Instrumental constants..
Mr, Amundsen thus contemplates making a
complete and systematic . magnetic survey of
the region about the magnetic pole, from which
not only .the accurate location of the ' magnetic
pole , may result,* but - other most important re
6ults t. will jfoMow.v The determination of the
north magnetic pole by Captain James Clark
Ross in : June, IS3I. rested on a single deter
mination. . Owing to local -disturbances, which
may be expected In .that region, there Is no
telling how close his determination was to the
actual, magnetic pole. His position was on
Bothnia Felix, in north .latitude VO degrees 5
minutes 17, seconds and . west . longitude JX$ de
grees 45 minutes 48 seconds.
.-. It \u25a0Is generally believed that the magnetic
pole Is subject to a fluctuation In its position,
and It fs \u25a0 hoped . Amundsen's work will throw
some ilight upon the rate and direction of mo
tion. -. \u25a0 -
LIVES JEKYLL

Prominent Attorney of-*N T ew.
York Is Found Guilty on
a Charge of Blackmail
NEW YORK, Dec Â«.â Thomas W.
Wickes, a prominent attorney, and former
Assistant Corporation Counsel, was to
day found guilty of. blackmail in the
criminal branch of ] the Supremo Court.
He was remanded for sentence next week.
The case of Wickes is one of the moat
peculiar in the criminal annals of the city,
and the man himself has come to be
known a* the "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"
of the legal profession. While occupying a
prominent place, among bis fellows In the
legal profession, and enjoying a high rep
utation. \it has been learned that under
the name of **Lewi3 Jarvls," which he as
sumed for the purpose. Wicks wrota hun
dreds of letters to persons who were in
terested in cases with which he was con
nected.
Nearly: all of these letters were con
fined entirely to praise of "Wickes, the
man and his ability in the legal profes
sion." Some of the letters, however, had
other ends in view and it was one of
these which resulted in the undoing of
Wickes. â¢
To, Dr. Edward "W. Stone of Newark,
N. J., several of these "Lewi3 Jarvis"
letters were written, advising Dr.
Stone to settle a certain litigation
against himself by paying several thou
sand dollars. Wickes was. found out
and arrested when he went to a post
office for letters addressed to "Lewis
Jarvis.** During the present trial he
admitted that he was the writer of the
letters.

THE EQUITABLE
Senator Tenders His Besig

Special DUpalch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Dec. 6.â The resignation
of United States Senator Chauncey M.
DepÂ«?w, as director of the Equitable LJfe
Assurance Â£oc2cty, was one of the most
Interesting developments to-day in the
situation growing out of the life Insur
ance investigation. The Senator's resig
nation was tendered to President Paul
Morton of the Equitable Society In a
brief note in which no reason for.lt was
stated.
The report was published to-night that
President John A. McCall of the New
York Life Insurance Companj" would re
sign from that company at the next an
nuai meeting of the trustees in April, and
that If he did not tender hie resignation
et a meeting of the trustees next "Wed
nesday, he would refrain only at the re
c.uest of the trustees, who, the report
said, did not wish to elect a temporary
president. The. published report also
stated that the presidency of the New
York Life Insurance Company has been
offered to John Claflin. a trustee of that
company, and president of the H. B.
Claflin Company, and Claflin has refused
to accept the office.
The meeting of the legislative investi
gation committee to-day was devoted
â¢ chiefly to the affairs of the Security Life
Insurance Company of Binghamton, N.
V., whose president, Charles M. Turner,
was on tht witness stand most of the
tay. His testimony and the reading of
contracts served to describe In detail the
organization of the Agency and Invest
ment Company of Binghamton in 1833.
This company paid the salary of the
president of the Security Mutual LJfe
Insurance Company at first; advanced It
money amounting to $S7,000; agreed to
furnish it with insurance business at the
rale of $5,000,000 a year, and received in
rtturn a 5 per cent.' commission on all
new premiums on insurance written by
the company.
NO IXSLIIAXCE I-EGISLATIOX.
Poll SbovrÂ« That (onirrrMi la \u25a0 Opponed
to Hasty Action.
WASHINGTON. I>ec. 6. â There will
be no Insurance legislation at this ses
eion of Congress. A forma! canvass of
the Senate made by supporters of Fed
eral regulation and by those opposed
to such legislation has disclosed that
the temper of the body is antagonistic
to action at this time. Many Senators
who are ' not absolutely opposed to a
national law hold that the question, is
too broad in Its scope and too complex
to warrant hasty action.
Some' of the ablest national lawyers
iiÂ« thfe- Senate believe no Federal -law
can be drawn which will stand the
test of a scrutiny by the Supreme
Court. They believe the judgment of
the highest court would be so clearly
expressed in several directions that
there is no hope that it would hold
the regulation of insurance to. , come
within fhe interstate' commerce* clause
of the constitution.
One .of these "Sen&tors said that' in
view of the Supreme Court's past deci
sions it would.be "little short of an
insult, to that, tribunal to pass a Fed
eral regulation -law." ;* .-.
There are. bowever. other eminent
lawyers in the Senate who incline" to
the contrary view. While they recog
nize the apparent obstacles presented
by some of the court's decisions they
point out that none of these have been
passed upon Federal legislation and
bc-lievc the court might hold differently
were the broad "question of constitu
tionality carried to it through an act
of Congress.
Realising -that the possibility of ac
tion by Congress may depend in a
largv in^asurÂ».pn thi* question of ,con-
Mitutionality Senator Culberson- .- of
Vemis introduced to-day and the Sen
ate, passed .without discussion a.reso
lution directing , the CommJttee on Ju
diciary to Inquire into and. "report to
the Senate whether., under the consti
tution. Congress has authority to su
pervise marine, fire and life-insurance.

GENERAL STAFF
URGED FOR NAVY
Bear Adniiral Converse Says
That Sucli Body Is Needed
as Part of Department
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6.â Necessary, to
the efficiency of the American navy,' in'
the opinion of Rear Admiral George ,A 1
Converse, chief of the Bureau of Naylga^
tion, is the introduction into the Navy-
Department of some "military administra
tive authority" to co-ordinate the tech
nical work of the bureaus, to. be respon
sible to the Secretaryfor; .the organiza
tion and preparedness of the fleet and to
advise in all military matters; that is the
creation by law of a navy board ox staff.
The pronouncement In favor of the gen
eral staff idea is based upon Admiral
Converse's experience of forty-four years
in the service, and it forms the feature*
of his annual report, made public at the
Navy Department to-day.
In this, his last annual report, as he
retires next May for age. : Admiral , Con
verse discusses naval administration
frankly and his recommendations gain an
especial Importance in the fact that they
prtSbably will form the basis of whatever
legislation Congress may enact to remedy
defects in the organization â¢of the de
partment. â¢ , ' \u25a0\u25a0--:. \u25a0\u25a0,-.
He says the lesson of greatest moment
for the navy taught by the Russo-Japan
ese war is the importance of the person
nel, the use of which work he applies
not only to the active fleet, but to the
department. Although prominence is ac
corded to the general board In the new
navy regulations recently issued, Admiral
Converse asserts that while this is prop
er, it is not enough. The board's status
and duties, he thinks, should be defined
by law. He adds: . --'.-â¢â¢
It has Become more and more evident as
the navy increases that some military ad
ministrative authority should be introduced
Into the department, such authorlts,- to co
ordinate the work of technical 'bureaus and
be responsible to the Secretary for- the: or
ganization and preparedness of the fleet I for
war and to advise in' I all military matters."
It should be its duty to initiate "the steps'
necessary to carry out the policy of the \u25a0 de
partment as formulated and directed 'by the
Secretary and under his command to direct
the forces in carrying- out that policy. / â¢;
The effect of a continued policy of. military
administration cannot be otherwise than ben
eficial to efficiency. It is not claimed that
it will prove a cure for : all '- evlla." ~ Changes
will no doubt be required . from time .to time
to perfect the organization, but the- bureau
is convinced from a study of the conditions
now existing in the service that it Is neces
sary for the efficiency of the navy. "Its neces
sity was recognized In our last war in the
formation of a board which occupied a. place
In the department Itself, j where I the â¢ latest
information from all points could be laid be
fore \u25a0It promptly and its advice sought and
acted \:pon with dispatch-
In a really serious war the deffianzs of
necessity wlli compel \ the formation of some
organization for the 'administration features,
by whatever ' name it may â¢ be ' called. : Its
creation and organization should . not be - de
layed until, war forces action.- . â¢.'

/Â®liÂ£ Reasons Why We-
h^M Don>t AsK for Mone y
hmL W UlfTll OUR PATIENTS ARE '
CurgdjoStay Cured
riRST-We have confidence r in bur ability to
cure all cases coming under the head dfrOur
specialty, which is confined exclusively do
disease and disorders of MEN ONLY^ -r^
"SECOIMDâ We: never accept a{case until;-we have
mad examination and feel c^n-
v fideht we^ can cure it .. . I
THIRDâ We do not* believe a is en-
titled to his fee until he has proven to the
satisfaction of thepatient that he can cureiiim:
f PURTHâ Our fee is so small, being only Sl2.>U,
; that W believe any honest man will pay
; it after he is cured. :
PlPXHâ There are so many impostors and un-
reliable so-called specialists that we believe
our methods will in time prove s our superior-
ity and hence be the niore profitable. -
SIXTHâ : Ouf enormous practice, built up on these
7 lines/ proves the fact of all our statements^
a us in advance he
might quit' treatment before being "perma-
nently cured, and ; our reputation would be
5 thus jeopardized. ; - ' , '/[} :
EIGHTHâ ShouId a few dishonest patients refuse
to 'pay \u25a0 after they are cured r the loss would
be only 512.J0 each, and we could stand it
xvith^ore fortitude than if it were a big fee,
SVifMTHâ Many honest men without ready money
might otherwise neglect themselves and thus'
'become mcurable, while our Ndt-a-(l6llar : *
lintil-Clired motto enables them to take ad-
Vantage of ":;our special skill and pay at their
f EIVTHâ Last, but; nqU least, we desire' to reach
: ptj^Jpop|||s \u25a0as the rich man, and by
::\: :\- making our fee only $12.^0,' payable on such
terms, we thereby increase pur business
;: and secure lasting gratitude from thousands
who .would otherwise remain afflicted fif it
were not for this liberal offer. ; !
All of the above reasons we are willing to verify and practically
demonstrate to the most skeptical. Our^offer isto^you, to every, one,
only $12.50 for "a'curer payable at your convenience, in such sums as
youcan spare. Could "an offer be more generous? It savors of -hon-
esty. v It-is honest" Nq matter what your trouble is-yif you suffer:: from
neglect, : for", want ; of money or fro ni unskillful practiceâ here is an .op^
\u25a0portuni'ty to get the services of a skilled specialist, a graduate physician,
with years of j ripe' experience in tr eating - complicated, and special j dis-
orders, of men only. It: will cost you nothing to talk to us, and may be
the means of restoring "you to health and happiness. Why not. call to-
day? Our offices are very private. You see only the doctor. If you
cannot call, write' for blanks, as we extend the same liberal offer to those
\u25a0who cannot: call. -In fact, there is : no excuse for being disordered or
sick while this liberal offer remains, .it is a gift of priceless value,
-within the reach of all. Remember, only $12.50 for any disease.

HOUSE DEBATES
THE CANAL BILL
Measure Appropriating $16,
500.000 Will Be Placed on
Its Final Passage To-Day
COM3IISSIO>: CKITICIZEI)
Â»
Its Statement of Expendi
tures and Estimates Re
garded as Too Incomplete
WASHINGTON^ Dec. 6.â With an op
portunity for unlimited debate- on the
subject of the Panama canal, the' House
exhausted its oratory on that, subject in
a session of four and^ three-quarters
hours to-day. The bill appropriating $16,
600,000 for canal work, which -was, the sub
ject of discussion, will be read for amend
ment and placed on Its flnal passase to
morrow. The feature of the debate was
the criticism indulgred in by both Repub
licans and Democrats regarding ihe com
pleteness of the statement of expendi
tuxes and estimates supplied by the canal
commission. Hepburn, in charge of the
bill, made some effert to show that while
detailed estimates might be made satis
factory, at the same time, members of
the House were not in a position to pass
critical judgment on estimates on such
work" prepared by expert engineers who
held responsible positions and had been
selected entirely because of their fitness.
Bourke Cockran of New York took de
cided exception to I this attitude on the
part of Hepburn. To enforce his argu
ment, he read the sentiment of the Presi
dent In his message for economy and
scrutiny of appropriations.
The so-called "press agent" of the
canal commission was criticized by sev
eral speakers, and lack of definite infor
mation as to the existence of such a po
sition was shown. The place was de
clared to carry a salary of $10,090 a year
and some curiosity was manifested as to
what were its duties.
ISTHMIAX CA\AL IX SIX YEARS.j
Major Gillette's Plan May Be Adopted
by the Commission. -7; ', ; /';
WASHINGTON, Dec 6. â Congress
probably never will be confronted with
the duty of passing judgment on a plan
for a sea level canal on the Isthmus of
Panama. There is certain knowledge
to-day that a canal plan which re
ceived scant attention from the board
of advisory engineers Is engrossing the
attention of the Commissioners and
that the President is studying it with
a mind open to conviction.
Official attention has been attracted
by this plan because It holds out a
glittering prospect of a complete canal
in six years and at a cost of only about
5130.000.000, an amount smaller than
the sum already authorized for canal
construction.
When the advisory board let it be
known that a majority of its members
favored a sea-level waterway, an army
engineer was bold enough to say In
print that to build a sea-level canal
across the Isthmus of Panama . "would
be the monumental engineering . mis
take of the age." This statement, in
the face of the opinions of. the great
engineers of Europe, attracted notice
because of its daring and it served
another purpose, for it set the mem
bers of the commission to the task. of.
looking into the plan submitted by the
presumptuous one. The report of the
advisory board will not be made public
in full for some time, but when it
comes it will be found that any sug
gested plan will have a strong rival
already in the field.
The officer who said plain . things
about a sea-level canal is Major Cas
6ius E. Gillette, whom the city of Phila
delphia wishes to put. in charge of its
filtration works. Gillette submitted a
plan for building the * Panama canal,;
but little was heard of it and it was
supposed it was slumbering .in canal
headquarters. Now there is adequate
authority for the statement that there
is a sudden and sharp interest in the
young officer's plan and this interest
is on the part of those who will have
the nnal word.
SENATE GETS DOWN TO WORK.
Several Hundred RIIIj* and Resolutions
Introduced.
WASHINGTON, Dec 6. â The Senate
began business In earnest to-day.
Several hundred bills and resolutions
were Introduced and, referred to com
mittees. . .
There were resolutions dealing with
the question of the national regulation
of insurance companies, the incorpora
tion of interstate railroad companies
and the contribution of funds to po
litical parties by national banks.
Forakcr presented his railroad rate
regulation bill; Gallinger his merchant
marine subsidy bill;* Lodge a" bill pro-
Tiding for a maximum . and minimum
tariff rate schedule in the fnterest of
reciprocity, and Culberson a bill mak
ing it a- penal offenSe to use thermoney
of Insurance companies in politics. .
The nearest approach to a contro
versy arose o% r er a resolution present
ed by N'ewlands directing the Interstate
Commerce Commission to draw a na^
tional incorporation,* act for railroads.
Spooner criticized the proceeding as
unworthy of the Senate. v ;
Objection was made to consideration
of a resolution offered by Tillman^for
investigation of the subject- of national
bank contributions for campaign- pur
poses, and, the resolution went over
for a day. * :-;

The citizens of San Francisco arc mani

made by. Attorney Francis J. Sullivan be
fcre the members of the Merchants' As
sociation at their .at .the Palace
Hotel on Tuesday evening. â¢ It was ; the

van's ringing attack on the report of En
gineer -AVllliam Barclay; Parsons and_his
open assertion - that . the United Railroads
was not working' for. the benefit of- San'
Francisco have aroused interest in the
street railway problem greater than ever
before.
The report of Mr. Sullivan's remarks
was inadvertantly, left out of yesterday's
Call. He spoke as follows:
"Mr. Chairman, Mr. Mayor Phelan,
gentlemen and fallow members of the
Merchants' Association: I feel it quite an
honor to address this body. I: do not be
lieve as Chauncey Depew does, or Mr.
Ford, that all speeches should, be made
before people "eat. However,\ I would ap
peal to my friend, Mayor < Phelan, or .Mr.
John McNaught of The Call on that. ' r
"I have heard the report of Mr. Par
sons with much interest. You all. recall
the .story of the man who, shot at" the
owl. The question is, did Mr. Parsons
hit the owl? Did he treat the transpor
tation problem and us In a fair and legi
timate way? ; . :
"There are two sides to every question,
I understand that. -The underground sys
tem and the overhead trolley/system both
have their advocates. But the election
recently; showed that the underground
conduit system was favored by a vast
majority; in San Francisco. .Â«-*_. ':\u25a0\u25a0> : . .
"Has Parsons -treated ' the subject '\u25a0>\u25a0. of
street transportation in San* Francisco
fairly -and legitimately? It^is" curious
that when \ the ! poor citizens of ' ; Slitter
street are working l.for. an .underground
electric road,* such, a plea imfavor. of the
overhead system .is \ given â¢ to .'the ; . public'
I do hot" wish to insinuate.anything.im
proper in this connection, but. it seems
strange to me.
OVERHEAD SYSTEM IS BAD., '
"UnevennesÂ»Â« -of ground, prejudice
nsainnt poles,. the vote of the people
(or an unclcrgrouud j aystem on Geary
\u25a0treet and its Implied verdict against
overhead .wires, are some, of the things
that reply to the Parsons ' report : that
San Francisco vrlll have .'undersrroand
system" for Its center, even. If It -does
have,.the n.ver)irud for Its snbnrbs. - The
objections to the overhead system are
the dlsflsarement of : streets by trolley
'wires and poles, constant ; danger. .to
firemen from heavily charged vrires,
dnnser of /nlres causing fires lit dwell
ings, loss of current and : Interference
with telegraph and telephone.
"It" seems curious to hear; a report in
praise of the overhead trolley'system only
without even a reference to. the opinionof
other dlstingished - engineers were
fellow-members ni the London commis
sion with Mr. . Parsons," and t who , were
favorable to i the : underground . electric
conduit. We know as a fact that the
latter system was adopted by theLioridoh
County Council, and further, that it;pro
poses to use it on all, streets in London.
The most striking thing about this -\u25a0 re
port Is that while the author caits: away
the cable as old rubbish \. he's insists on
the use of the overhead Â»trolley." as -the
only method of transit. The position the
people are placed in by. its author re
minds ons of Cramweil's Initial order to
the Irish, r 'To hell or'Connacht.' ; Either
was bad enough, but the witty CeltVre
plied, 'You take hell,* I" will take Con
nacht.' That is, our'people will stand. by
the cable because they can't do anything
else except to take the cheap , and nasty
overhead trolley. , '' ' -

Townsend railroad rate bill, which passed
â¢ the House at .its '\u25a0 last session, has been
Predrawn and was. reintroduced in the
House to-day by: Townsend." "The "Bill
embraces all of the features of the former

any shipper a special rate under the short
term ; provision for; changing rates. :
' As ;; explained to-day* by Townsend,- the
bill expresses, the _ ideas of the. President
in his message arid will, if 'enacted^ into
law, amend the interstate commerce laws
, to as to make itmore effectual in securing

: It enlarges': the Interstate Commerce

The Secretary calls attention to;, the
Japanese poachers In Alaskan waters. In
this connection he says:
During -the early spring: American interests
encaged In the Alaskan' fisheries petitioned tin;
department-. to. take steps- to prevent .the en
croachment of Japanese,, fishermen-' on the sal
mon 7 fisheries of Alaska. Hip the absence of a
law prohibiting aliena from: fishing in Alaskan
\u25a0n aters ' the department -couhl do no more ] than
Investigate "the* situation.-. Instructions to this
effect were accordingly Issued to the special
agsnts of this department, and, through , the
Trvasury . Department, "to the of fleers of ' Uie
revenue cutter service.
Acting â¢\u25a0 under \u25a0 these instructions Captain .W.
H Robert?.â commanding the revenue cuiter
Perry ' proceeded to - Attu " Island. ' the -farther
rcost Island of the * Aleutian sroup. . â¢Â«rhere on
June . 27. ;; 10C3. vhe r tliscovered \ four Japanese
schooner? conducting : extensive .flshln? opera
tions.'-"- The vessels , carrlea ; substantial , crews,
were equipped with all necessary apparatus for
catching, cleaning and salting flan. -and when
discovered ha 1 taken about 7500 salmon. They
had observed no customs regulations, were
clearly trespassers and reft Saranna Bay with
in twent7-four hours after tne arrival of the
cutter. Â«. . . \u25a0..
The reports received by thÂ« department by
its special agents also show that during thÂ»
season thre?' other Japanese BChoonera entered
regularly at Juaean, Alaska. This latter ex
pedition did not attempt to conduct fishing op
erations, but bought from American fishermen.
While the extent of the operations of alien
fishermen has not thus far assumed a formida
ble or dangerous aspect, the situation Is never
theless one which requires immediate attention.
The catching,, curing and canning of salmon is
'an American Ipdustry of great promise. It JÂ»
estimated that the value of property Invests!
, In this business Is $30,000,000: that thÂ» nnmbur
of employes U 25.C00 and that the value of
the annual product !s J20.000.000. If the Jap
' anese are permitted to take salmon In Alaskan
waters they. will not purchase from American
fishermen and the sale or this commodity to
Japan which In 1904 amounted to 5,451,1 M
': pounds, valued at $06, 2Â«, win decrease Â«r itilÂ»
altogether.
In view of toe fact that: there are estimated
to be nearly 900,000 Japanese families engaged
In fishing: that Attu Island, where the Japa
nese expeditions were discovered. In upward
of "ninety-six miles nearer to Toklo than It fci
to San Francisco, and that salted salmon Is a.
favorite food among the Japanese. It Is fear*i
that Japanese fishermen will swarm Into Alas
kan waters In large numbers unless some pre
ventive action Is Immediately taken by this
Government. To that end I recommend the
enactment of a law which will absolutely pro
hibit allena from fishing In American water*.
The administration of this law should be
vested m the Secretary of Commerce and^La-
bor \u25a0 who should be empowered to maae ana
enforce such rules and regulations as may be
necessary to carry it into effect.

OAKLAND, Dec. 6.â After having

Fletcher Sims, the son of John F. Sims,
president of the Western Iron Works
in San Francisco, with which the for
mer was also connected, died to-day at
Providence Hospital, where he was
taken immediately after the accident, j
Death was caused by a fracture of the
skull at the. base of the brain.
Mrs. J. F. Sims, the wife of the <Se- j
ceased, from whom he had been sep- j
arated for several years, has taken I
charge of the remains, and the funeral
will be private. Mrs. Sims has resided
for a number of years at 2421 Warring
Street, in Berkeley, with her two daugh- I
ters, both the children of the deceased.
Elms and his wife I had never been di- i
vorced, and as soon as her husband
died Mrs. Sims took charge of his re
mains.
Shortly after separating from his j
wife Sims erected a beautiful bunga- j
low In Alameda, where he lived under j
the name of F. M. Williams. With j
him resided a woman, who has been, j
known as Mrs. Blanche Williams, who !
bad claimed ty be his wife. The dual j
life of Sims was not discovered until a
chort time ago, when, while riding with (
a party of friends in his automobile, j
Sims ran over and killed Justin Bitterly, j
an Inmate of the County Infirmary. !
After the accident, which happened ;
near the Institution of which the vie- \u25a0
tim was an inmate, Sims gave the name '
of F. M. Williams and his address at
Buena Vista avenue and Stanford
Street, in Alameda.
Oa calling at the office of Sheriff
Barnet the next day, however, Sims,
being known under his own identity by
the Sheriff, gave his right name.
Beyond the statement that her hus
band had never secured a divorce, Mrs.
Elms refuses to discuss the case. As
soon as the death of Sims was an
nounced Coroner Mehrmann took charge
and an Inquest will be held.

Fred Becker, Accused of Vio
lating It. Before Police
Judge.
OAKLAND. Dec. 6-Police Judge Smith
this afternoon intimated that he would
dismiss the charge against Fred Becker
of violating the law regulating child
labor. Attorney M. C. Chapman, who
represented Becker, held that the law
Tvas invalid, in that a little one without
parents or guardians or a certificate from
the Superintendent of Schools must
etarve, according to its provisions.
"According to this law, I cannot em
ploy a child, without kith or kin, unless
I commit a crime." declared Chapman.
â¢'Such a child must starve, unless charity
puts in his mouth a crust of bread, or In
his heart a ray of hope. The child with
parents can live. The lawmakers under
took to protect both and failed to protect
â¢one. Should I desire to have a little
Kirlâ a neighbor â come to my bouse and
cinq I should have to get the permission
of Mayor Mott or some other official.
I say the law is all wrong and that It is
Invalid."
Fred Eschelman of the State Labor
Commission assisted Prosecuting Attor
ney Leach. After hearing the arguments
Judge Smith pointed out that the law
prevented children who could not read
or write from procuring occupation and
he intimated that he would hold It In
valid. Becker was arrested as a result of

SCOTT'S EMULSION.
A PERFECT FOOD.
That Scott's Emulsion
should act so quickly and
satisfactorily in all cases
of lost flesh and continued
wasting is not surprising
when its food value is un-
derstood. With pure Nor-
wegian cod liver oil, hypo-
phosphites of lime and
soda and glycerine, there
is combined in Scott's
Emulsion the best ele-
ments of nourishment and
strength building known'
to medical science. Any
physician will tell you this.
The use of these ingredi-
ents in the proper propor-
tions ; the employment of
only the purest grade of
each, and to combine them/
perfectly is the secret of
the success of Scott's
Emulsion. You will not
find a more certain way to
stop waste, build flesh and
strength and supply nour-
ishment ..than through
Scott^s Emulsion. ,'. :

HAPPINESS LASTS

Mrs. Emma Silliman Says Husband JHas De
serted Her and Babe, Taking
Wedding Presents.
WIFE OF A YEAR WHO CHARGES HER HUSBAND. A YOUNG OAKLAND
POLITICIAN. WITH DESERTING HER AFTER STEALING HER WEDDING
GIFTS. FAMILY INTERFERENCD, SHE ALLEGES, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR
HIS ACTION.
OAKLAND. 'Dec. 6.â Deserted by a
husband of little more than a year and
alleging that she had been robbed of
her valuable wedding presents, Mrs.
Emma Silliman to-day appeared before
Police Judge Smith and secured a
search warrant to recover her treas
ures. She declares that her husband,
Lowell Silliman, deserted her and her
two-months-old babe and sold their
wedding presents to secure money on
which to flee.
Lowell Silliman is the son of Sam
Eilliman, a coal dealer of Sixteenth street
and San Pablo avenue. Until recently he
conducted a cigar store at San Pablo
avenue and Fifteenth street. His wife
says be drank to excess and , gambled
on the races, but she declares that the
real cause of their troubles were the
members of his family. .
Mrs. Silliman. before her marriage,
was Miss Emma Fitzgerald, a member
of one of the pioneer families of Oak
land. About a year ago she surprised
her friends by marrying Lowell Silli
man, who was well known in political
circles. They lived happily for a time,
but recently there has: been trouble. at
their home at 669% Twentieth street,
and now the husband has left for parts
unknown, leaving his wife and babe to
shift for themselves. Mrs. Silllman'B
story follows : r }) Z' '.:'â¢
We lived happily, until' my husband's family
Interfered. I did my best, but It was of no
avail. WbÂ«n we were married Mr. Silliman' Â»â¢â¢
relatives and mine cave us many costly wed
ding: presents. They were all in my name. I
cooked a dinner Thanksgiving. day and after
ward went to visit my mother at -803 Grove
street. When I returned Friday there - was
not a piece of furniture In the' house and my
husband had disappeared. There - was nothing
left but mine and our baby's clothing. \u25a0\u25a0
My ilster. May Fitzg-erald, . and I went out
to look for the furniture to-day and we. found
most of it In an auction houÂ»Â» on Clay street.
We therefore secured a search warrant to re
cover the goods, but we have not yet . located
the more. valuable pieces. I have . already be
gun proceedlr.es to secure a divorce from my
husband, but I am determined that \u25a0 he shall
provide for his child.
As she talked Mrs. Silliman held the
babe in her arms and her V. story, of
pathos was punctuated by the cooing of
the little one. The search warrant pro
ceedings will be heard by Police Judge
Smith/to-morrow.

College Students Accused of
Stealing Periodicals From
Library on the Campus
| BERKELEY, Dec 6â Students of the
j university who patronize the library on
j the campus, and who have made a prac
i tice of taking magazines- and not return
1 ing them, are referred to as thieves to
! day by L. D. Bohnett, editor of the
(Daily Calif ornlan,-. In an .editorial which
has stirred the -student body..
I Bohnett has used very plain language
in his editorial, declaring^that people who
j committed the offenses he charges against
f students, if they were without 1 friends or
I position would be sent ' to prison. | Bon
nett's editorial is as follows::"
It Is hard to believe that any college stu
dent fs ;so careless of the rights of others
or so. far lacking" in moral principles . as to
be guilty of mutilating or Btealing a magazjne
that Is freely lent to him by . the university.
But hard as It is to believe, \u25a0 the ' fact is. that
magazines have so frequently : been taken. from
the shelves and never returned' or returned' so
bad ly mutilated as to be worthlew. , that the
librarian has found ; It' necessary â¢to require
application at the desk and the deposit . of a
library card- In order .; to get any -one of the
more popular magazines. Some r persons have
made a' practice of deliberately tearing out of
a magazine an. article, they, liked: or of taking
the whole magazine away, and as a result of
their nefarious work thÂ«i hundreds who have
use for the magazines are put to inconvenience.
: Any \u25a0 person ' who so debases ! himself -as-. to
abuse lin j this ( way the privileges \u25a0 granted . him

DESCRIBES AREA AFFECTED, v
A detailed description of the geological
conditions of the area affected by the
pumping operations of the company fol
lows, showing that the various' valleys
from which -the water finds its way to
the gravel beds of the Niles cone slope
from the hills of the Coast Range to the
shores of San Francisco Bay.! The com
mittee found that *the underlying gravels
from which \u25a0 the water is drawn . and
which extend' from Niles to Oakland, and
possibly 'as far south as San Jose, are
affected throughout by the drawing of
the* water from the innumerable. wells
sunk by. the Spring Valley Company, and
that the. supply of water has grown
steadily less year 'by year .since the in
stallation of the first pumping plant in
1900. â¢ \u25a0'-'\u25a0 ' ".\u25a0 ".- -- v ' '". \u25a0
The \u25a0 committee found' in^ the course of
Its Investigation that previous jto * the in
stallation bf the pumping plants of "the
company -.the bay shore belt of the dis
trict was artesian, and that flowing, wells
could- be sank at almost any. point from
Oakland to Alviso. With" the installation
of: the 'Spring Valley Works . these wells
ceased to flow, and, It has' since become
necesÃarylto sink them deeper and deeper
to get' water, and many have become en
tirely dry.
' A complete description of; the. works. of
the company : shows that in addition to
the surface works nearly 100 wells I have
been sunk about a mile and a half below
Pleasanton. - New works ' are now in
course of construction : on the Overacker
place, comprising 100 acres adjoining the
Centervllle I^igh School, "which will com
plete the draining of the Niles cone. The
report 1 says: \u25a0\u25a0''\u25a0 \u25a0' '. *'"
The crops . began ,to \u25a0 deteriorate \u25a0; because . of
the absolute suspension of ' all. Bub-irrigation
from the gravel beds during summer. It : was
not- possible to grow berries i and | garden 1 truck
for. market of any> description throughout a
district embracing 100 square. miles without ir
rigation, resulting In enormous losa to Alameda
County. Fruit' trees were next: to suffer, as
was evidenced by * greatly lessened production ;
and' as they 'died, deep-rooted : varieties v were
planted In. the belief that they .would "reach
water, but.' without success, an the water table
had- dropped" from thirty, to forty feet: below
the surface, in localities where it was formerly
to be found at a quarter of that depth.. Many
wells .went, entirely? dry, irrigation \u25a0\u25a0 from -the
creek was.no longer rossible ; by, either ditch
or. pumping, for. lt contained no' water in sum
mer,' and crops were seriously Impaired as far

order that the electric. power, might be avail

gave his view's of; the struggle and the
reasons ' why, ,the ; war ended as it did.
He had much \u25a0< to say In praise of the
performances of the Japanese warriors,
lie said in part:
The Jaoa.'won. constant victories because:
First â Throughout the Japanese army there
was preparedness, - trust, conlidence and help
fulness; - i second â Confidence In the general
start, . which was not . hampered by. orders from
Toklo, .and hearty co-operation- between it and
the -officers of the liner third â Everything was
subordinated -to the 1 general good, . to the ac
complishment of the object In. view; fourthâ
An It almost ' Derfect * military v information \u25a0 de
partment and, spy system; fifth â An earnest
endeavor to have i every rifle . in - the line of
battle; sixthâ By kindness and prompt payment
for stores and services the friendship and good
will of the inhabitants of the theater of war
waa won. .-..' :, - . \u25a0
â¢V; The ? Russians suffered constant defeat be
cause : The efforts of the \u25a0 general staff were
hampered by . the orders | from St. Petersburg
and rendered almost abortive : by : the enmity
existing between its officers and those. of the
line; military necessities were, subordinated to
personal comfort. Luxurious trains of the com
roander-ln-chlef; and , other high officials | had
the right of way,' to the neglect of troop and
supply trains. This with a elngle line of rail
road was a- terrible drawback. There wai a
complete breakdown of the military informa
tion department and spy system. This left
them almost in the condition of a blind football
eleven contending with a* perfect \u25a0 team. The
soldiers taken â¢ from the ranks to act as ser
vants for the officers, averaging over three to
each -.: of fleer made a grand atrreeatlon of
40,000 rifles taken from the line of battle. The
soldiers also by their tyranny and oppression in
curred the ill will and hostility of the inhabi
tants of the field of operations.

versrt^ Writes- Article *De
vnouncing: ithe Muckers
EEMEDT WITH UMPIEES
Says the Men Who Injure the
Game by Their Brutal Play
ing Should Be Ruled Out
Swclal Dispatch to The Call.
â¢ STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Dec. Â«.â
President David' Starr Jordan of the
Stanford University has given out for
publication an article written while on
his Eastern visit discussing the football
question. The article discusses fully both
phases of , the current topic. It is in part
as follows : ' *
, While men are sometimes killed at football
and sometimes maimed for lire, such things
do not often \u25a0â¢ happen outside of the. raw be
ginnings of ' the untrained secondary schools.
What Is called the brutality of football Is
greatly exaggerated in current criticism. The
number of deaths is scarcely greater pro
portionately than that arising from fcprsaback
riding, rowing, . yachting, swimming and other
forms of. manly exercise from which danger
cannot be wholly excluded. Brutality is by
no means inherent in football. For tlxat mat
ter rough play wins rk> games. Â«- Tet*we must
confess that brutality is - too of ten", present,
brutality, criminal and beastly. '.Thi* - indi
cates the pretence of the mucker â a typÂ« of
man the very opposite of that which it is
the business of the university to discover and
develop.
It is very doubtful whether a more open
game . would be less dangerous. Most serious
accidents occur in the tackling of a twin
runner in the midst of his interference, th*
very play that is the moat Interesting to
the spectators. -As- matters, are the game la
t,oo beefy. ' There , is too great a premium on
mere muscular force and too much stress on
the ability to hammer, a weak place in tne
line, until at last it gives way through sheer
exhaustion. ' - -
The remedies for actual brutality or dirty
football . are -mainly two: The- direct penalty
and the elimination through scholarship and
other academic tests of the dirty men who
make games dirty... The direct remedy is in
the hands of the umpires. This remedy Is
never sure enough, for umpires do not see
everything- and sometimes do not try to>- There
are umpires who will think twice before .rulinff
out members of * powerful team, on whose
good will future chances for umpiring may
depend. Moreover the penalty Is not severe
enough. Dirty play "at -football stands In the
same category as cheating at cards. It shows
the offender to be a cad. a mucker, a thief,
who has no rights .in the presence ot gentle
men. To be convicted of dirty football should
bar the person in question from all future
intercollegiate games. That the innocent might
not suffer from the umpire's bad Judgment on
the moment there should be some sort of a
court of final appeal. But the proper anti
dote for muckerism must rest with the uni
versity in its relations to Its own athletic
\u25a0sorts. .

THUGS ATTACK
A BRIDGETENDER
Choke Him Until He Becomes
Unconscibus, After Which
They Eifle His Pockets
ESCAPE IX DAEOESS
"Mayor" Sands, an Employe
of California Northwest
ern Bail way, Their! Victim
Social Dtsaatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL. Dec. B.â Two thugs â¢*
' called "Mayor" Felix Sands, the aged ,
bridgetender " of the California North
western Railway Company at Greenbrae,
two miles south of this city, to the door
of his cabin, on the. center of the draw
; bridge, early this morning, grabbed him
by the throat, and after searching htm
for money and valuables beat; him until
be became unconscious. From Sands
meager description oÂ£ the robbers they are
believed, to be two tramps who were
camping near Schuetzen Park for the past
few- days.
; Among other theories advanced Is one ]
that the men are" ex-convicta who worked
; in the road gang near Greenbrae and were
: acauainted with Sands' habits, and from
i rumor b-lieved that he had plenty of
[ money on hia person. . . . . _ . . ,
Sands has been at Greenbrae for nearly
twenty-three years, and for more ' than
twenty years has attended to the draw
bridge. He wag dubbed . "ilayor" many
I years ago, and la popularly known as thu
; "Mayor of Greenbrae" by the thousands
who have lived at Greenbrae during his
time. He Is 70 years of age..
Sand3 y in talkins of the robbery, said:
"It was about 2 o'clock, just after the
northbound freight had passed, when I
heard footsteps approaching from the
Ban Rafael side of the trestle.' I heard
one of them say, 'Hello,' Mr. Sands. Open
tha door and come out.' I thought they
were friends from Larkspur or San Ra
fael and opened the -door. The men wore
slouched bats, pulled down on their faces.
One was tall, and of slight build, the
other was shorter and stouter.
"ThÂ« taller of the men' grabbed me by r
the throat, while the other went through
my pockets. They became abusive and
struck me when they discovered that my
pockets were empty. I struggled : and
struck the tall man in the stomach with
my knee, causfvg him to double up and
cry out *He has done me up.' Then the
other .man felled me and Jumped, on me.
That was the last I remembered 'for* sonte,
time. When I regained consciousness the
men were gone, f.yfi ,> *. i\

The faith and trust or a woman, so
v ?:rong that they stood uncrumbling
m gainst all the bitter thoughts of the
'r-aafts a cruel world might hurl from its
!.>mparts of glass, shines brightly from
iind casts a halo of romance about the
recent marriage of Mrs. J. A. Campbell
. of Berkeley to George H. Jamison. She
*tood with him at the altar, though he
hud told her he had but recently left a
felon's cell at the San Quentin State
Prison. She believed him innocent.
Trusting love is one of the beauties of
feminine character, and this woman had
the courage to marry a man when she.
knew that by so doing she might be
dragged 10 the verge of absolute social
ostracism. He had told her his story
sir.d she accented it.
Mrs. Campbell is the widow of the late
Police Judee Campbell of this city, and
i* a member of the social set of Berke
lry and Oaklandâ a woman whose friends
are not limited by the boundaries of a
dozen cities. She slipped away to Sacra
mento with this man and married him
bwause she loved him Tor what he was.
He had told her of his term in the State
jv-nitentiary, 2nd swore to her that he
had been wronged by the jury which had
lound him guilty. She. woman-like, be-
Jicved him. but. urged by this man, who
was too honorable to let her take a blind
ctep, she went over the evidence taken at
tbe trial and weighed It carefully. It es
tablished the fact, to her satisfaction,
â¢hat he should not have been convicted.-
Hrr surrender was complete and she went
with him to Saeramer.to to be married
This was on November 27.
Then the couple came back to Berkeley,
wht-re Mrs. Campbell has made her home
'-^.uring recent years. Jamison started up
;:i business. He oi>ened a furniture stbre.
People came to make purchases. They
liked him and came again. He seemed
hocest and upright. Kindliness beamed ia
his every feature. Besides, he was the
husband of Mrs. Campbell, and she had
and pay for it next year 1

world. He was making money. ' .
BERKELEY HEARS STORY.
The former convict'and his newly wed
ded wife were happ# together. One
question burned in their minds. Should
they tell their friends of the fact that
he had wcrn the felon's stripes? . They
were living <juietly , in their, little Ashby
avenue home. Why should they risk the
world's cold glance by telling of a prison
past? they asked themselves. The world
is ever ready to grasp any bit, of personal
history which scents of a scandal, this
they well knew, and . why'- should they
give outsiders an opportunity i to shun
them? "Give us a chance to prove that
this man Is honest before the condemning
news is known," was . their , plea. . ' Sir.
Jamison was - introduced as a "business
man from Chicago." Mrs.
daughter, Mrs. Anita Dunwiddie, left the
home because she could not agree with
her mother's views. / i V^'
And so the pair lived and prospered.
The world did not condemn", because it
did not know the history of the man,. but
loved the man and woman for what they
were worth. ...
The truth came out yesterday and the
quiet college city of . Berkeley ' was
shocked. Gossips hurried and, met. In a
few hours the news had spreadi Some
have condemned. The majority have
taken the saner view, _ are resolved' to
take the pair for* theirs true worth and let
tlme.tell the character of this man. ' \u25a0-.
Jamison was committed to San Quentin
orf a charge of larceny for stealing two
leather suit cases containing clothes
valued at $112 from .F. M.Black, a.Pull
man conductor. The, men^had formerly
been roommates and Jamison \u25a0 claimed
that he had permission to take* the cases.
He was sentenced in February, 1904, to
eighteen months in prison. He was- re
leased in fifteen months because of his
exemplary behavior. Then he went to
Oakland. . . . .
According to an- agreement made be
tween Mrs. Campbell and Jamison before
the marriage, Mrs. Campbell Is to Retain
in her own name all of the property in
her possession at the time of the wed

PUBLICATION OFFICE THIKD AND MARKET STREETS. SAN FRANCISCO
THURSDAY. .** : , . . < DECEMBER 7, 1905
THE TROLLEY PROPOSITION,
BY an unfortunate error in making up the forms, only one side
of the discussion at the merchants' banquet was printed
in The Call yesterday by the omission of the able speech of Honl
Frank J. Sullivan. By way of rectification, we publish the speech' this
morning. There is no question of the wish of the people to substitute
electricity for the cable wherever feasible in our street railway sys
tem. Nor is there any doubt of the practically unanimous opposition
to the overhead trolley for that purpose. The overhead wire is a
passing- device for the application of electric power to street cars.
It represents the archaic period of electricity. It belongs ( on the "'
scrap heap with the original dynamos and primitive devices that be
long to the empirical stage of electric development. To permit it on.
the streets of San Francisco will be like returning to the old bobtail,
horse cars. It would put this city among the "ha% beens." \
The overhead wire is an obstruction in all. of its aspects.,, The
Sustaining posts are obstructive of access to the sidewalks. . The !
network of high power wires is not only an obstruction, but a dan
ger of the most serious nature. The trend everywhere is to -the
putting of all wires under ground. There the high power they carry,
if it escape, cannot endanger life, nor cause conflagrations. If the
plan were novel and. untried, objections to it might be heard with
patience. But it is not an experiment. It is a demonstration. The
very extensive electric" road system" of Washington City is run by
underground trolley, and so it must be here if electricity is to take
the place of the cable."* ' n \
The overhead trolley comes definitely under the head of public
nuisances, abatable by judicial process, and the people of San
Francisco should fight it by every legal resource within their reach.
The people are, not inimical to the United Railroads, but they will
not submit to a policy in the interest of that corporation which back
numbers the city and makes its streets dangerous and unsightly.
The Merchants* Association listened patiently and politely to the
proposition of the United Railroads, but its sympathies are with the
views expressed by Mr. Sullivan, "which The Call indorses in their
entirety.
THE MESSAGE.
THE President's message deals almost entirely with the domestic
and internal problems and affairs of the country. Its focus is
the railroad rate question. He somewhat clears the atmosphere
on that issue. Heretofore all of the opposition to his supposed views
has been based upon the statement, not. anywhere , made by him,
that it was his intention to empower the Interstate Commerce Com
mission to make all of the interstate railroad rates. Against this
many valid arguments have been made. The main strength oi the
opposition was found in the fact that it would be giving- to a purely
political body absolute power over transportation, and that the ad
vantage of this would finally swing to the section of the country
that had the greatest political influence. I
The President makes it plain that this view of his policy is
mistaken. He says : "In my judgment the most important provision
which such law should contain is that *conf erring upon some com
petent administrative body the power to decide, 1 upon the case being
brought before it, whether a given rate prescribed by a railroad is
reasonable arid just, and if it be found unreasonable and unjust, then,
after full investigation of the complaint, to prescribe the limit of rate,
beyond which it shall not be lawful to go, this decision to go into
effect within a reasonable time and to obtain, from thence onvvard, :
subject to review by the courts."
This makes it- clear that whatever official body is to deal with
the question takes no jurisdiction over transportation rates, except
upon complaint against a specific rate established by a railroad, and
that it will hear evidence and decide upon the reasonableness of such
rate only. It will be observed that the President uses the "term "ad
ministrative body" in describing the official agency that shalltake
such jurisdiction. At that exact point appears the crux of the whole
question. It is desirable to relieve a complaining shipper of the op
pression of delay, and the cost of long, litigation. He is subject to
such dilatory' tactics as may be employed by the corporation of
which he complains, and with which he has joined issue. To avoid
this the President .proposes that the rate fixed by the administrative
body shall go into effect and continue in force, pending appeal to
the judicial courts. ; :
If the body which displaces the unreasonable rate with a rea
sonable rate were called a judicial body, it would be. plain to laymen
even that its judgments cannot be executed pending- appeal, for an
appeal would act as a stay of execution. /The whole Spirit "of. 'our
law, derived from the constitution itself, is that judicial judgment
is not enforcible until it is made a finality. If appealed, it cannot
be a finality until passed upon by the court of last* resort.- The
question therefore is, can the statutory style and title of an official
body as "administrative" give it the right to take jurisdiction, hear
evidence, render an appealable judgment, and execute the ; same
pending appeal? With that the courts will have to deal.' It is a
well Jj understood principle that the character of an official .body is
determined not by its title, but by the functions bestowed upon it
by laSv. The functions of the proposed administrative body are es
sentially and purely judicial. They deal with property.' Property,
the constitution declares, is subject only to due process of â¢ law, and
due process of law is held by the courts to be the judicial process*.
The collection of a public tax , is an administrative function,
whether it be local or Federal, excise or customs. The collector is
an administrative officer, and, though his acts may be appealed from,
he continues to collect in the appealed case until.it is judicially de
cided. The reason for this is obvious. The collection of a tax, excise
or customs, is necessary for support and existence of the Govern
ment. If collection must be suspended during an appeal from the
decision of the collector, it would be possible by general. appeal to
deprive the Government of revenue and embarrass or perhaps de
stroy it by taking away its support. Therefore a purely administra
tive conclusion is enforced until reversed, on appeal, by a judicial
court. It is probable that \u25a0 the President's' suggestion is: derived
from an analogy between the fixing of. a railroad rate by an admin
istrative body, and the collection of taxes by an administrative offi
cer. But is there an analogy between the collection of taxes for the
benefiuof sovereignty and the enforcement of a freight rate for the
benefit of an individual?
The purpose of the President is plain and praiseworthy. It; is
to hasten the hearing of appeals and prevent dilatory tactics.; If the
courtS'hold, as they may, that the .means proposed *are not adequate
to secure this, the same end may be reached by Congress establish-l
ing procedure by statute that will hasten an appeal to *a; finality,
and by providing that the Government .shall appear hi court for the
complaining shipper, at the option of the Attorney General; \u25a0
It is probable, however, that before reaching satisfactory legis
lation the courts must pass upon the' constitutional issues involved,'
and that Congress will hasten results by putting, in an adminis
trative body the powers asked, for. by the President. If the courts
void such legislation on constitutional^ grounds, there is still left
ample means for attaining the same, ends.

BECOMES COOK
Captain Henry T. Ferguson
Is to Go to Fort Eiley
to Learn Breadmaking
WILL CONDUCT SCHOOL
When He Completes Course
He Is to Give Instruction
in the Culinary Art
Captain Henry T. Ferguson of the com
n:L<?*ary department will leave for Fort
F-iley. Kans.. about the first of next week
to take a fun course in the school for
ccoka and bakers at that post. Upon the
completion of his course Captain FÂ«rgu
*en will return to this coast and conduct
a iÂ»chool of instruction for army ofScers
and will give them a thorough course in
the art of making bread.
This course has been contemplated by
tae War Department for some time, and
recently the school at Fort Riley was
remodeled, with special accommodations
for officers, and details from every divi
sion of the array were ordered to the
post far a cix months" course In the soft
and peaceful art of cooking. At the com
pletion of their course these offlcers will
travel to the different poets In their Si
visjon and every "Officer in the army will
nave to pass a cooking exaznlnaxica be
fore he will be considered competent for
promotion.
The War Department , has lately dis
covered that a greAX deal of dyspepsia
acd indigestion are now prevailing among
the enlisted men on the account of poorly
prepared food by inexperienced army
cocks. It has row been decided that each \
company commander shall personally su
perintend tie cookinjf for the men in his
command, and in the case of an inexpe
rienced cock he shall take said cook and
give lam personal instructions until eaid
cock is able to pass the required ex
amination.
This is only the first move in the line
of refcra for the United States army.
The War Department has decided that
there shall not be any more scandals,
such es the embalmed Ceef and several
others that attracted the attention of the
public during the late war. and as soon

"aad it is not surprising- that my diges-

should have become thoroughly de-
racg-ed from the effect of the starchy,
highly seasoned, greasy dishes usoally

&t this time was that I might reach the

YUKON STORY
The Reader Magazine for December has
a good short story by Rex B. Beach, the
autnor of "Pardners." .The scene- Is laid
in a mining camp on the Yujcon, and it
tells the story of .one Montague Prosser,
who was a fine fellow, t>ut to. the tough
men of the camp he seemed. In his desire
to live a perfectly clean life, to hold him
self undemccratically and absurdly aloof.
He disdained gambler* and dance-hall
girls and would have no association with
whisky drinkers. His talk appeared to
them "skimmed and seminaried" at first,
but after they got to know him & bit
they found out "his verbal structures
had vital organs and hair on their chests
just like anybody else's, and at the same
time had the "advantage of being fit to
send through the mall*.'*
One day Prosser's desire to keep his
life from, moral contamination led him to
treat, one of the dance-hall girls. Olive
Morceau. with so disdainful an indiffer
ence that one of the old miners rebuked
him. for it, saying: - "I never before see
such an intelligent damn fool as you
are." The girl had been exposed to great
cold, and the men were nursing- her up
by putting her bare toes to the stove and
dosing her with whisky. \u0084 ;7- â¢ -
It turns out that there is a great deal
of et>o<l in thÂ« dance-hall girl, and Pros
ser. in Â«pite of his puritanical rearing,
fails in love with her. She is so over
whelmed with surprise, when she find* it
cut. that she quits the dance-hall life for
ever.

Henry Van Dyke has a poem embody
ing quite a pretty interpretation of life
in the Christmas number of Scribner's
Magazine. It is much helped out by
handsome decorations, done in tints, by
J. C. Leyendecker. It Is founded on the
legend of Aristaeus, the youngest shep
herd of Apollo, whom tne god made
keeper of his hives of white bees. The
young shepherd was happy in his task
and his lot until across his pathway
came Euridice. Then love's consuming
fever caught him and he pursued her. In
her Sight she trod upon a serpent, and
like a dream *he vanished. On his return
our. hero found his garden empty, his
hives deserted, all the music fled. Then
was he sad. for joys that once escape us

There is an account of "The Fearful
Art of Jlu Jltsu" in the December
number of the Outing. It is written
by Robert Edgren and the writer
treats the Japanese art of unarmed
fighting with very serloss .respect.
There seems to have been a disposi
tion to speak lightly of the art's for
raidabllity because when the expert
Japanese Jiu Jitsu man. Hi gas hi, went
Into a wrestling match with the Amer
ican athlete, George Bothner, the hon
ors seemed to be with the American.
Really when we come to consider the
match we see that it was no test at aIL
American wrestling is - for > sport ' and
the contestants are careful .not" to kill
or seriously Injure each other, but
quite the contrary, the Jiu Jlt.su tricks
are to kill, seriously Injure, or at the
least temporarily and thoroughly dis
able. Higashi was made to promise
that he would not do " his American
opponent any serious bodily harm. Con
sequently he could only make use of
some of his. minor tricks. If it had
been a contest In deadly earnest the re
sult might have been a. very quick vic
tory for the Jap. Sharkey, the .prize
fighter, tells a story on himself 'about
how easily a Japanese overcame him
in a little fight of sailors and Japs. Jiu
Jiteu is an art that has been perfected
by study and practice for 300 years and
it stands to reason that it must :\ be
quite dangerous when an expert In it
puts it to use in earnest.

WEDS PROSECUTOR BEFORE
HIS CASE IS CALLED.
John Green Tries to Defeat Justice WitH
the Assistance of : Gupid.
The wily Cupid played a star en
gagement yesterday "morning at the
City Hall when John W. Green, herb
doctor, hustled out Mrs. Mary; Brun^
nings, a wealthy widow, and married
her while Superior Judge Coffey was
waiting to hear a case against Green,
who was "cited to show what he ' did
\u25a0with J2IQS of the woman's money.
When the news was broken in the
courtroom all was In a flurry and Judge
Coffey could do nothing more than con
tinue the case for a week to test the
legality of the marriage, which will
probably be declared void because the
woman is ' incompetent.
The tale is both a humorous and a
pathetic one. The woman, who served
a term in the Stockton Insane Asylum,
seems to be under the spell of the
alleged sharper. When the .parties ap
peared in court Mrs. Brunhings was
accompanied by her lawyer, X E. Har
per, and. her legal guardian, ; Sergeant
of Police Moffltt, yet the artful Green
managed to elude the vigilance of the
entire^ representation and "marry- the
womali before any one. was the wiser.
The case was called for 9 o'clock
in Judge Coffey's courtroom and when
the parties appeared the Judge had so
much work on his hands that he put it
over for an hour. Green left the room
first and was followed by the others.
He had it arranged with the woman
and together they went to see Cupid
Danforth, procured a license and In
record time made for Justice of the
Peace Golden's court. .: ~j;;~^
JUSTICE "MARRIES COUPLE.
They stated they wanted to be made
one without waste of time or words
and the Justice quickly complied with
the request. Green led his bride from
the Justice's court and Into the_ \ Su
perior Court, where Judge Coffey called
the case. ;
The storm was quick to break. Ser
geant Moffltt went over to talk to Mrs.
Brunning-3, who in a matter of fact
sort of way Informed him/she had be
come Green's wife a few minutes be
fore. The"' Judge was dumf ounded,
the lawyers were .perplexed, the spec
tators amused. * There was nothing to
do but put the case over for a week to
test the legality of the marriage.
The cateof Mrs. Brunnings is a pit!-:
able one. she 13 the widow of the late
Martin Brunnings, a former pioneer,
who kept a saloon, and grocery
on the 3lte of the -. present Crocker
building-. He amassed a fortune there
and when he died several years ago
he left his widow upward of $100,000
In. property and real estate. :\u25a0â¢ ;
Since, .that time* the fortune has been
fast dwindling away from Mrs. Brun
ninars. In May, lS93,.she was declared
insane and sent to the Stockton Asy
lum. She was released two years later
and - a few months ag-o . became ac-.
qualnted with Green, who poses~as a
herb doctor.
He quickly Installed himself into the
good graces of the woman and ft Is said
he exercised -some sort of a spell over
her. He got j money from her on various
occasions, and some time ago opened an
office at 845 Howard ; street, a few dors
from where Mrs. Brunnings resides.
GREEK SECTRES THE MO.VET.
Many: months^ ago Green obtained $2105
from the woman and she later became
uneasy regarding it, so Green 'was cited
to appear in court about two weeks ago.
The case was continued li till - yesterday,
when the j storm broke. Green agreed to
pay the woman the ; money at 1 the rate of
$30 a ' month. However, 1 he failed to pro
duce a bond or note," but \u25a0 his manager
and legal adviser, Carl Brown, of. Coxey*s
Army, fame, wrote ; the following missive
to Sergeant Moffltt, for [ Green Is Ignorant
and unable to ' read or .write \u25a0 his 'own

Plan ll T nder Consideration
of Holding National Cham
pionships in This City
NEXT MAY THE DATE
Matter of a Guarantee Is
Only Apparent Obstacle
at the Present Time
From present indications California, or
more properly speaking, this city, will
occupy the center of the stage in Ameri
can athletics next year. In addition to
the week of outdoor sports which will
mark the opening of the splendid public
aihleiic grounds in Golden Gate Park
next Slay there will be the international
cross-country race over the Marin Coun
ty mountains for a thousand dollar cup
Â»rd possibly a boxing tournament for the
.American championship.
The latter proposition has developed re
cently and is being considered both by
the officials of the Olympic Club and by
the Pacific Athletic Association. The one
hitch at the present time is the demand
of the Amateur Athletic Union for a
guarantee' of $1200. There is_ some doubt
U8 to the uses to which this Is to be put,
hence the delay in deciding as to the ad
visability of holding the tournament here.
If the tournament is held here and men
are brought from all parts of the coun
try the bouts will be decided either in
the Olympic Club or in Mechanics' Pa
vilion. If in the latter place the general
public could witness the bouts for a nom
inal admission fee.
The competition would be thrown open
to all aspiring amateur boxers and not
restricted to those who had previously
qualified for the championships.
The boxing would round out the list of
competitions which would attract a won
derful collection of athletes to this city.

Â«;Â«Â»<Â«Â« Mx I Â«MÂ»n Rrgulatton Rounds . With
Ills Hoiinn Partners at Alameda.
That Bob Fitzsimmons can still go
pome is made patent daily by the globe
swinger from the home of the kan
garoo when he attacks a punching bag
and a pair of barly sparring mates in
a continuous performance that runs
from twelve to sixteen rounds. He
vent over the latter distance yester
day afternoon and at the wind-up the
.^ag"-lcg"g-ed scrapper was ready for
more and right there with the come
back wallop. Good nature is char
acteristic of Fitz's training work and
lie not only receives the necessary phy
sical exercise from his boxing bouts
with his partners, but also makes the
milling a source, of pleasure to himself
and amusement to onlookers. His
antics while swapping swings and jabs
with his training mates, Billy Bates
ttnd Harry Chester, are often provoca
tive of mirth to observers and these
are many. Bob's gymnasium is open
to sl\ every afternoon and large crowds
â¢witness the ex-champion's daily bat
tle with the bag and his sparring with
his husky handlers.
When Fitzsimmons goes on the road
in the morr-ing he is usually accom
panied by his pair of aristocratically
bred French poodles, imported from
Paris. Ten or twelve miles are usually
traveled by Bob and his dogs, and. after
a. rubdown on returning, a layoff is
taken until 3 o'clock in the afternoon,
when the gymnasium stunts begin.
Fltz weighed 159 pounds yesterday. He
expects to tip the scales at, 158 pounds
when he fights O'Brien, who, it is said,
plans to' weigh about ten pounds
heavier than his salmon-complexioned
opponent.
AMATEURS IX THE RIXG.
Hawthorne Club Card .Is Made Up of
Srrru Iloutx.
The amateur boxers will hold the
boards to-morrow evening at the Haw
thorne Club show in Woodward's Pa
vilion. Three champions will fight to
retain their titles. In addition to these
special events four other bouts are'on
\\u\ programme.
Bob Ward is slated to go four
rounds with P. Da\-is. Ward has had
the advantage of training with Phila
delphia Jack O'Brien and he has prob
ably picked" up a' few pointers about
the game which will stand him in
good stead when he faces Davis.
George Murray and Jim Hornbuckel
will meet at the middleweight notch.
Murray Is at the top of this division by
reason of his recent victories. The
balance of the card is as follows:
Kyle Whitney vs. Otto Knoch. 1 Joe
Kane vs. Joe Leahy, Johnny Murphy
vs. Jim Ervin, Harry Riley vs. Al
Lloyd, Willie Conroy vs. Charles
Weber.
Motorlstn Will Have a Run.
The members of the San Francisco
Motor Cycle Club will have, a "blind"
run on Sunday, Captain F. M. Byrne
being the only Â«ie to know the destina
tion. He will see to it that the mem
bers have a midday luncheon and prom
is-es to return them home at 4 o'clock.
The members will have a smoker in
their clubrooms in the Pioneer build
ing next Tuesday evening. They are
planning an endurance run - for next
May from Los Angeles to this city.

BEDELLS GAltf / A LAP*
With This Lead They
Should, Barring Accidents,
Win the" Six-Day Contest
NEW, YORK. Dec. B.â Harry PaynÂ»
Whitney,. sitting with a sroup oj ,
friends in a box at Madison Square
Garden, was directly responsible Just
after midnight to-night 'for one of the
wildest bicycle sprints ever seen In the
great amphitheater. Immediately after
they were seated a messenger was dis
patched to the training quarters of
four contestants they had chosen to
compete for a $200 prize. A purae had
been made up, each of the party chip
ping in an amount sufficient to provide
$200, which was to be -^warded to the
team gaining a lap.
â¢ With a vim unprecedented in the an
nals of six-day. racing they set out to
win. John Bedell, the favorite with thÂ»-^
"400," led oft and rode around the
course at a frantic pace for several
laps. When he eased up he gave way
to Trousseller of the Frencn" team,
who wanted *to quit on: Monday nighty
but was finally-prevailed on by Robert
Coquelle to continue. After riding: at
heartbreaking speed Trousselier was
relieved by Decaup. his partner, who
had come on the track and started out
after, the other wily Frenchman.
Mr. Whitney and his ' friends ap
plauded joyfully as they saw Decaup
take Trousseller's place in line and
sprint for the lap. When Moran took
up the running- and rode like a man
possessed they applauded even more.
When John -Bedell again took the lead
with a dash that aroused the sleepers
up in the gallery, the Whitney party
went wild with, enthusiasm.
Jiloran had tired and Bedell had caught
him. T*he. ' desperate racing lasted an
hour, v Hall was , left behind with 1 the
loss of a lap. Downey was late in get
ting out and his partner had lost a lap
before the little Bostonian appeared on
the track, i
As a result of this wild sprint the
Bedell, team gained a lap on all the
other contestants.' Two of the* teams,
the Hall-Downey and the Trousselier-
Decaup combinations, worn out by the
terrific struggle," at- midnight, dropped
from the ranks during the early morn
ing hours. \u25a0 "_\u25a0--.'
The Hall-Downey team withdrew from,
the race when It found that during a
spill in the midnight sprint, Hall had
broken his collar bone. Several riders,
all of whom were trying to catch
Bedell, went down in the fall, bat im
mediately mounted their, wheels and.
rode madly ahead. Hall was as quick
as the others to mount and he kept up
the pace until after > 3 o'clock in* r the
morning," when he suddenly pitched un
conscious-; from; "his;- ; ,wheel. ..He. was
thrown by..the fall completely;, over the ,
fence * and into one of the I spectators* '
boxes, . f. iv , ' * .

Both Captain Jones and the

Here agraln she made repairs, and

Carrlral.
And now comes word from Concep
cion, Chile, that after all the repair
ing: the Deudraeth Castle has been
iihandoned at sea under, circumstances
to be learned.
The Deudraeth Castle was a vessel
Df 1524 tons. She was built In ISS6 at

a saloon opposite. She stood on thesteps,
pulled a revolver : J from her: pocket and
commenced firing- at Pedranzini. â: She
emptied the revolver, but all of the shots
went wide ; of the mark. The first went
through- the., window of the saloon,
through the bar, and lodged in the rear.
The second went through. the floor above,
but- there is no trace of the other three.
After firing -the shots, the woman

"Little regard has been paid to the limita

still low and loans hlzh. so that the margin
continues slender on which to conduct any bull

plains why the market leaders select one stock
at a time for adiancement in preference to en
gineering a general advance, a movement
which would yulckly fall to pieces under ex

NEW YORK, Dec 6. â The conspicuous fea
ture of the etock market to-day continued to
be thÂ« great variety of different Issues In
business was recorded, rather than the
*-e&t bulk of the aggregate transactions. Ad
.â¢vuices at special points also -were more notable
A'-ia the upward movement In geneial. There
*Â»?re many prominent market leaders, in fact,
which moved narrowly all -day, and In which
the volume of dealings was rather below than
b bore, the normal. Nevertheless, the specula
tive 6pir!t was %-cry much alive, and diligent
in making ventures upon even the slightest
euggestlons calculated to direct It. There were
occasional pauses In the- violent advancing len
dpncT \u25a0which were pretty closely colncidÂ«nt
*!-h*tbe advances In the call money rate. The
â¢purls In the money rate seemed to have the
effect of simply checking operations until the
late flight to 25 per cent weakened the whole
market. There wu no evidence of any en
fenced liquidation caused by extensive calling
of loans and shifting of accounts. It seemed
to be the determination of speculative operators
to pay the ratrc for money demanded and to
ara!t the cÂ«*artnÂ« up of the money outlook
\u25a0without .eaerlflcint their holding*. It was ob
vious that steady realizing had been conducted
throughout at Â«ome very important points In
the cierketJ This was especially true of Union
I'aciac wfcich was steadily fed to the market
\u25a0 t a practical advance over last night and
which made the highest price of the day Im
miÂ»<!U.tely after the opening. There was the
tame tendency manifested in United States
Etf-el stocks, and Reading also showed the ef
. feet of a similar process. Added to this was
th* effect of profit taking in *ome of the spe
cijtltto, -Which have risen most violently Jn tbÂ«
rt"?*"nt tradlnir. Vague rumors of mergers con
tinue a large Influence In this class of the
tp^r-ulatton. National Lead, the Southern iron
\u25a0t ,cks atid the Junior Vanderbllts were all sub
ject* of such rumors, .none of which was new
In any particular. ThÂ« relapse In Lead was
*Â«>pe^lal!y violent, and New York. Chicago and
6t. Louis, which again led the Vanderbilt
rnovemont. lost all of its sensational gain on
the reaction. The declaration o' only the reg
ular dividend on American Pmeltlng deprived
that stock of one cans* of stimulation In the
'v*\.tnorÂ» of * proposed. Increase In the dividend.
. AT't;Â« Gould eronp of railroads were -distinctly
'f^'.rosg in fyropathy with one another. The
list ot substantial leaders which shared in* the
tfay'a advance was small, however. Aroalga
* mated Copper bad the advantage of, another
advance In- the price of copper. The "pressure
to 'realize Increased considerably in the stock
market toward the end of the day and carried
T-'r.!on Pacific a point under last night and
r â¢Â«â¢.!.>â¢ other prominent stocks a fraction. The
cJ(*lnÂ« tone waÂ« weak. .

THE COPPER STOCKS.
BOSTON. Dec. 6. â Copper "Range again fur
nished moÃt of the activity to-day. The stock
was in good demand all day. The directors of
the Mohawk Mining Company declared an Inl
tal dividend of $2 payable January 10 to stock
holders of record December 29. The divi
dend was encouraging and on .limited trading
Mohawk advanced to 64% c. : The New York
buying of Boston Consolidated . still continues.
The $1 dividend declared by Copper Range re
cently makes the total amount paid: during
this year $1,540,000. The net earnings for 1005
will approximate two and a half millions/ and
after new construction work will leave nearly
$700,000 to go to surplus.' Quick cash assets
are now said to .be \u25a0 over two and | a auarter
million, which would pay $1 60 . quarterly 'on
stock next year, while earnings for- 1906 should
approximate $10- pp r share.. Copper Range is
producing copper to-day at 8 cents. -
Banks were calling loans all around here
to-day.. Money is liable to be very scarce lo
cally. In which event liquidation, of copDers
would naturally result. '. ,v ... .v -. â¢

Xew York Cotton Market.
NEW YORK, DÂ«c. 6.â The market opened
steady. 9 points lower to 3 points higher, with
trading active on call, and there wai a rush
to buy by commission houses, and the market
advancwl to the high point of. the. season, but
on the advance there: was heavy; profit taking
which carried prices oft somewhat, but -on the
decline the buying" was considered good. Liv
erpool btill continues to reluse- to follow tba
advance here except when forced to.- The mar
ket acts well, but there !b a claw of traders
who sail it short on every/ rise ; on the theory
that a reaction la due. . '. \u25a0'\u25a0\u0084. '*\u0084
The market to-day was generally conceded* to
have ahown remarkable strength and wonder
ful Dowern of absorption, glt | not only stood
up againat a 20 per cent call money rate and
Liverpool's failure to make more than half
the response necessary i to : have equaled our
advance of yesterday, but also .against' very
heavy : and rather general : selling during tho
day on a reDort that the National 1 Dinners'
Association would estimate fully 8,400,000 bales
ginned up to December 1, against 7,500,000 on
November 14, accordinir to ' the : figures \u25a0of â¢ the
United States Censws Bureau. :; After, having
reacteil 12 to 18 points early in the day ! the
market turned strong and established another
new high record for the seaeon by advancing
12 to 15 points over last night's clOÃlng quo
tations at about the top. The United States'
Census Bureau report on the amount of- cotton
ginned uo in, December,. 1 is * due ; to = come out
on Friday afternoon.: It will be valueless, how
ever, for comparative purposes, as the census
bureau did not make any report* covering the
period .to December. 1 last' year. -

CHICAGO, 1 Decl. 6. â The wheat ; market was
strong; almost the. entire fÂ»esslon to-day. :"\u25a0 In-;
fluenced by higher prices at . Liverpool and by
small receipts 1 in. the Northwest - the market
opened" firm, with May up --^Â©ViC to j %@%c
at S9@S9V4c.: During the- first â¢\u25a0â¢ hour there
was moderate "â¢> buying ; â¢by .pit - traders.' â¢ but
upon the announcement of | large ' deliveries on
December contracts 5 the . same j traders became
sellers. Thef result, was^ a y considerable ' re
action.* which carried .the i price, of .-'the -May
opUon down to BS%c. The market then rallied
sharply | and * throughout ! theY remainder of \u25a0 the
session sentiment was extremely bullish. : The
up-turn was mainly due "to â¢Â». persistent' demand
from ; the - leader of the^ bulls, who took all
offerings of . May that .. were in - sight. :. Total
purchases of , this ' option Iby - this | one | trader
were estimated. at over 2.000,000 bushels. ; Al
though the strength resulted \u25a0 chiefly * from thia
demand a number ot factors ''augmented the
bullish feellog-. Among these;, were 'liberal
clearances , at the seaboards a nd> the strength
of j cash wheat at â¢ the principal, grain : centers
in the United States. \u25a0. For. May the highest
point of the day was reached atOOVic. The
market closed strong, ; with May 'le, to l%c

. Moderate demand from commission houses
and shorts created a firm tone -In the. corn,
market. The light movement . from the coun-
Hryand the poor grading of local; receipts' also
lent fctrength to the market. -. The â¢ continued
excellent demand j from exporters furnishes ad

\u25a0 Active general demand caused strength .:. In.

In their anxiety to prove that Mme.
Tojettl unduly influenced : the late
Honora Sharp to execute her last testa
ment, counsel^ representing â¢ â¢ Joseph
O'Donnell, : a cousin of the deceased,
proved yesterday beyond the possibility
of a doubt that if Mme. Tojetti did un
duly influence Mrs. Sharp she. did so
at a cost to 'herself of* no. less a" sum
than $75,000.: O'Donnell is contesting
the will, on the ground that it was ob
tained; through the exercise of .Undue
influence >nen Mrs. Sharp was suffer
ing from senility, and, : it;seems, he has
now been hoist by his own petard. >;
Yesterday morning'; lidward ;F." Hill;
aii attorney, 'was. called, to. the stand to

expressive of "her real desires, when in

a will he drew ffor Mrs.; Sharp in 1900,
but in~this will j neither 'O'Donnell' nor
any relative of the "deceased was men
tioned.. Furthermore .in-^it^ -Mine;* To

and had no.subsequent will-been drawn
she would have intterited i$100,000.v; In'
the subsequent .will that' is being con
tested, ijime. Tojetti is .devised .only
$25,000, so if in fact she did unduly, in
fluence Mrs. Sharp to execute -the same,
counsel point to the fact that she cx
i hibited , rare qualities of unselfishness
1 and an unaccountable desire to deprive
j herself of the right to a fortunes

condition during the last few months
of her life. : Their testimony was f not
J of special importance, and waslargely

night: he had Tdrawn a sword and

straw headgear, with distorted brim,
heavily ladeji with artificial grapes
and vine leaves, was. strikingly In con
trast with her black gown and a long
rope of, large jet beads dangling from
her neck proved possession of more
vengeful-- feeling than her sister had
just shown. The Judge had hinted. his
desire' to have no further airing of the
Mulkey family skeleton im his court,
when Miss- Bessie abruptly and some
what peremptorily reminded him that
she: had -not been called to rtestlfy. "I
have-something to say." she ; declared,
"and I'd* like to tako the, . witness

and she Jsaid that "what her father had
sworn did not entirely quell the.qualms
of fear' his 'sword play had planted in
her heart. Urged ? by her., sister, how
ever, Bhe ' finally conceded, that con

.tinguish, l her dread of a recurrence of

WOMAN CAUGHT
TAKING SKIRT
Miss Mary Glotzbach, who says she is
a hairdresser and lives at 725 O'Farrell
street, - was arrested at Welnstock, Lubin
& Co.'s store yesterday afternoon by De- j
tective Wren and booked at the City
Prison on a charge of petty larceny. She
gave : her . age as 35 and her birthplace
.as Monterey. â¢ .
i The employes at the store say that the
woman . had been . hanging around there
for some days, and their suspicions were
aroused. It was decided to watch her,
and yesterday afternoon when she walked
Into the store several pairs of eyes fol
lowed her movements. She was seen to
enter a retiring â¢ room â¢ and was quickly
followed. She was" caught, in the act of
putting under her dress a black skirt she
had deftly lifted Jfrom the counter, where
it was displayed * among others. ,
She was detained and police headquar
ters notified. Detective Wren went to the
store and placed the woman under ar
rest on a chaige of petty larceny. She
said that she and two other hairdressers
had been partaking of a French dinner,
and in a spirit of fun they all agreed to
take something from one of the big
stores. She was to take a skirt, another
a pair of gloves and the third some hand
kerchiefs. -- \u25a0Â» \u25a0
Detective Wren did not believe her story
and he was 1 instructeu by Captain Bur
nett to search her room at 725 CFarreh
street to see if he could find any other
stolen property. 1 , *.Â»
Detective Wren discovered a valuable
i opera cloak in the woman's roonv to
gether with several other . articles -of
clothing. She said' they had been given
her by a friend -in Portland.
mosphere had abruptly become unsavory.

man led to the discovery that while
Messrs. ; Bergman and Griffin : were, con
veying a* dozen qf their ware ; to : a cus

* With nostrils pressed between â¢ his left
thumb and forefinger.* Patrolman Young
succeeded in braving the stench suffi
ciently: to enable him to 'arrive within
hailing, distance of the peddlers twain,
and after vociferously, informing them
that they were under arrest he instructed
Ithem to proceed- at once* to the Central
police station, accompanied by their
wagon. The line of march J was malodor
ous for an hour after the procession had
passed. At the prison -fumigants were
applied; and when Messrs.*" Bergman and
Griffin appeared as defendants before
Judge Mogan on the charge of having
sold impure food they could be talked to
with i impunity , at close . range.
"/"Where did you procure the. ancient
eggs?", his honor inquired, after thÂ©
story, had been told..
