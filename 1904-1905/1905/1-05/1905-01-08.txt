THE chords of the key of F flat are given on
these charts with the relative, the key of T>
minor. Place one of these charts at right
angles with the keyboard, so that the small
letter D with a dash above it on the chart is directly
over D on the keyboard. Then the white spaces
on the chart will be over the white keys and black
spaces over the black keys. The top, middle and
lower sections on the lower chart represent the
three chords, a mastery of which will enable any
one to accompany on the piano any song or melody
in the key of F, and the upper chart represents the
chords of the key of D sharp minor. The colored
letters are "to be played with the left hand, the
black letters with the right hand.
Now, having placed the chart on the piano, play
the colored letter on the top section with the left
hand and then the three black letters in unison with
the right hand. Now play the middle section in the
same way, then the lower section, and then return
to the top section. The small letter D with a dash,
which gives the chart position, must not be played.
The knowledge of the keys and the facility in
striking the proper chords form the basis of all
musical knowledge. Keep the chart on the friano
until you are thoroughly familiar with the chords in
the ,keys given in this week's lessons, and when
memorized you are quite as well equipped for the
playing of accompaniments as one who has studied
music for years.

FROM that day forward fear
settled on the placeâfear of
some blow that none could
foresee, and against which they
could not guard. Sir Andrew
even talked of leaving Steeple and of
taking up his abode in London, where
he thought that they might be safer,
but such foul weather set in that it
was impossible to travel the roads,
and still less to sail the sea. So it
was arranged that if they moved at
allâand there k were many things
against it, not the least of which were
Sir Andrew's weak health and the
lack of a house to go toâit should not
be till after New Year's day.
Thus the time went on, and nothing
hapnened to disturb them. The friends
of whom the old knight took counsel
laughed at their forebodings, saying
that so long as they did not wander
about unguarded, there was little
danger of any fresh attack on them,
and if one should by chance be made,
with the aid of the men they had
they could hold the hall against a
company until help was summoned.
Moreover, at heart, none of them be
lieved that Saladin o- his emissaries
would stir in this business before the
spring, or more probably until another
year had passed. Still, they always
set guards at night, and, besides
themselves, kept twenty stout men
sleeping at the hall, and arranged also
that on the lighting of a signal Are
upon the tower of Steeple Church
their neighbors should come to succor
them.
So the time went on toward Christ
mas, before which the weather changed
and became calm with sharp frost.
It was on the shortest day that
Prior rode up to the hall and told Sir
Andrew that he was going to South
minster to buy some wine for their
Christmas cheer. The knight asked
what wine there was at Southminster.
The Prior answered that he had heard
that a ship laden among other things
with wine of Cyprus of wonderful
quality had come into the river
Crouch with her rudder broken. He
added that as no shipwrights could
be got from London till after the
Christmas feast to repair it, the chap
man, a Cypriote, who was in charge of
the wine, was selling as much as he
could in Southminster and to the
houses" about at a cheap rate, and de
livering it by means of a wain that he
had hired.
Sir Andrew replied that this seemed
a fair chance to get fine liquor, which
was hard to come by in Essex in
those times. The end of It
\vas that he bade Wulf, whose taste
in strong drink was nice, to ride with
the Prior into Southminster, and If
he liked the stuff to buy a few casks
of it for them to make merry with at
Christmasâalthough he himself, be
cause of his ailments, now drank only
water.
So Wulf went, nothing lothâfor in
this dark season of the year when
thsre was no fishing, it grew very dull
Joiterlng about the hall, and since he
did not read much, like Godwin, sit
ting for long hours by the fire at night
watching Rosamund going to and fro
upon her tasks but not speaking with
her overmuch. For notwithstanding
all their pretense of forgetfulness, some
sort of vei' had fallen between the
brethren and Rosamund, and their in
tercourse was not so open and familiar
as of old. She could not but remember
that- they were no more her cousins
only but her lovers also, and that she
must guard herself lest she seemed to
show preference to one above the oth
er. The brethren for their part must
always bear in mind also that they
were bound not to show their love, and
that their cousin Rosamund was .no
longer a simple English lady, but also
by created rank, as by blood, a prin
cess of the Bast, whom destiny might
yet lift beyond the reach of either of
them.
Moreover, as has be#Â», said, dread
sat. upon the rooftree croaking
raven, nor could they escÃe from the
shadow of its wing. Far Ifway in the
East a mighty monarch had turned
his thoughts toward this English
home and the maid of his royal blood
who dwelt there and was mingled with
his visions of conquest and of the
triumph of his faith. Driven on by
no dead oath, by no mere fancy of Im
perial desire, but by some spiritual
hope or need, he had determined to
draw her to htm, by fair means if he
could; if not, by foul. Already means
both foul and fair had failed, for that
the attack at Death Creek quay had
to do with this matter they could no
longer doubt. It was certain also
that others would be tried again and
again till his end was won or Rosa
mund was dead âfor here, if even she
would go back upon her word, mar
riage itself could not shield her. So
the old house was sad, and saddest of
all seemed the face of the old knight.
Sir Andrew, oppressed as he was with
sickness, with memories and fears.
Therefore, Wulf could find pleasure
even in an errand to Southminster to
buy wine, of which, in truth, he would
have been glad to drink deeply, if only
to drown his thoughts awhile.
So away he rode up Steeple Hill with
the Prior, laughing as he used to do
before Rosamund led him to Bt.-Pe
ter's-on-the-wall ,to gather flowers.
Asking where the foreign merchant
dwelt who had wine to sell, they were
directed to an inn near the minster.
Here in a back room they found a
short, stout man, wearing a red cloth
cap, who 'was seated on a* pillow be
" tween two kegs. In front of him
stood a number of folks, gentry and
others, who bargained with him for
his wine and the silks and embroid
eries that he had to sell, giving the
latter to be handled and samples of
the drink to all who asked for them.
"Clean cups," he said, speaking in
bad French, to the drawer who stood
beside him. "Clean cups, for there
comes a holy man and a gallant
knight who wish to taste my liquor.
Nay, fellow, fill them up, for the top
of Mcunt Trooldos in winter Is not so
cold as this cursed place to say
nothing of Its damp, which Is that of
a dungeon," and he shivered, draw
ing his costly shawl closer round him.
"Sir Abbot, which you taste first
âthe red wine or the' yellow? The
red is the stronger, but the yellow is
the more costly and a drink for saints
in paradise and abbots upon earth.
The yellow from Kyrenla? Well, you
are wise. They say it was my patron
St. Helena's favorite vintage when she
visitfd Cyprus, brjnging with her Dis
ma's cross."
"Are you then a Christian?" asked
the Prior. "I took you for a Paynlm."
"Were I not a Christian would I
visit this foggy land of- yours to trade
in wine?" answered the man, draw
ing aside the folds of his shawl and
revealing a silver crucifix upon his
broad breast. "I am a merchant of
Famagusta in Cyprus, Georgios by
name, and of the Greek church, which
you Westerners hold to be heretical.
But what think you of that wins,
holy Abbot?"
The prior smacked his lips.
"Friend Georgios, it Is indeed a
drink for the saints," he answered.
"Aye, and has been a drink for sin
ners Â«re nowâfor this is the very
liquor that Cleopatra, Queen of Egypt,
drank with her Roman lover. An
tony, of whom you, being a learned
man, may have heard. And you, sir
knight, what say you of the black
stuffâ'Marvo,' we call itânot the
common, but that which has been
twenty years in cask?"
"I have tasted worse," said Wulf,
holding' out his horn to be filled again.
"Aye, -and will never taste better if
you live as long as the Wandering Jew.
Well, sirs, may I take your orders?
If you are wise you will make them
large, since no such chance is likely to
come your way again and that wine,
yellow or red, will keep a century."
Then the chaffering began and it
was long and keenâindeed, at one
time they had nearly left the place
without purchasing, but the merchant
Georgios called them back and offered
to come to their terms if they would
take double the quantity, so as to make
up a cartload between them, which he
said he would deliver before Chrustmaa
day. ' To this they consented at length
and departed homeward, made happy
by the gifts with which the chapman
clinched the bargain, after the Eastern
fashion. To the Prior he gave a roll
of worked silk to be used as an edging
to an altar cloth or banner, and to
Wulf ;a dagger handle, quaintly carved
In olive wood to the fashion of an
rampant lion. Wulf thanked him and
then asked him with a somewhat
shamed face if he had more embroidery
for sale, whereat the Prior smiled. The
quick-eyed Cypriote saw the smile and
inquired if it might be needed for a
lady's wear, at which some neighbors
present in the room laughed out
right.
"Do not laugh at me, gentlemen,"
said the Easterner; "for how can I,
a stranger, know this young knight's
affairs and whether he has mother, or
sisters, or wife, or lover? Well, here
are broideries fit for any of them."
Then bidding his servant bring a bale,
he opened it and began to show his
goods, which, Indeed, were very beauti
ful. In the end Wulf purchased a veil
of gauze-like silk worked with golden
stars as a Christmas gift for Rosa
mund.
Afterward, bethinking him that
even in such a matter he must take no
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALII
advantage of his brother, he added to
it a tunic embroidered with sold and
silver flowers such as he had never
seenâfor they were Eastern SOHps
and anemones, which Godwin would
five her also if he wished. These
silks were costly, and Wulf turned to
the Prior to borrow money, but he had
no more upon him. Georgios said,
however, that it mattered nothing, as
he would take a guide from the town
and bring the wine in person, when
he could receive payment for the em
broideries, of which he hoped to sell
more to the ladies of the house.
He offered also to go with the Prior
and Wulf to where his ship lay in the
liver, and show them many more oth
er goods aboard of her, which, he ex
plained to them, were the property of
a company of Cyprian merchants who
had embarked upon this venture joint
ly with himself. This they declined,
however, as the darkness was not far
off; but Wulf added that he would
come after Christmas with his brother
to see the ship that had made so great
a voyage. Georgios replied that they
would be very welcome, but if he
could make shift to finish the repairs
to his rudder, he was anxious to sail
for London while the weather held
calm, for there he looked to sell the
bulk of his cargo. He added that he
had expected to spend Christmas at
that city, but their' helm having gone
vj] ong in the rougii weather, they were
driven past the mouth of the Thames,
and had they not drifted into that of
the Crouch, would, be thought, have
foundered. So he bade them farewell
for that time, but not before he had
arked and received the blessing of the
Prior.
Thus the pair of them departed, well
pleased with their purchases and the
Cypriote Georgios, whom they found a
\ery pleasant merchant. Prior John
stopped to eat at the hall that night,
when he and Wulf told of all their
dealings with this man. Sir Andrew
laughed at the story, showing them
how they had been persuaded by thÂ«
Kasterner to buy a great deal more
wine than they needed, so that it was
he and not they who had the best of
the bargain. Then he went on to tell
tales of the rich island of Cyprus, where
he had landed many years before and
stayed awhile, and of the gorgeous
court of its Emperor and of its inhabit
ants. These were, he said, the cun
nlngest traders in the worldâso cun
ning, indeed, that no Jew could over
match them; bold sailors, also, which
they had from the Phoenicians of Holy
Writ, who. with the Greeks, were their
forefathers, adding that what they told
him of this Georgios accorded well with
the character of that people.
Thus it came to pass that no suspi
cion of Georgios or his ship entered the
mind of any one of them, which, in
deed, was scarcely strange, -seeing how
well his tale held together and how
plain were the reasons of his presence
and the purpose of his dealings in
wines and silks.
CHAPTER VI.
The Yule Feast at Steeple.
The fourth day after Wulf's visit to
Southminster was Christmas morning,
and the weather being foul Sir Andrew
and'his household did not ride to Stan
gate, but attended mass in Steeple
Church. Here after service, according
to his custom on this day, he gave a
largesse to his tenants and villeins, and
with it his good wishes and a caution
that they should not become drunk at
their yuletlde feast, as was the com
mon habit of the time.
"We shall not get the chance," said
Wulf, as they walked to the hall,
"since the chapman Georgios has not
delivered the wine, of which I hops
to drink a cud to-night.".
"Perhaps he has sold it at a better
price to some one else; It would be
like a Cypriote," answered Sir AnÂ«
drew, smiling.
Then he went into the hall, and as
had been agreed between them, to
gether the brethren gave their Christ
mas gifts to Rosamund. She thanked
them prettily enough, and much ad
mired the beauty of the work, laugh
ing when they told her that It had
not yet been paid for, and saying that,
however it was come by, she would
wear both tunic and veil at their feast,
which was to be held at nightfall.
About 2 o'clock in the afternoon a
/
servant came into the hall to say that
a wain drawn by three horses and
accompanied by two men, one of
whom led the horses, was coming
down the road from Steeple village.
"Our merchantâand in time after
all," said. Wulf. and, followed by the
others, he went out to receive them.
Georgios It was sure enough, wrap
ped up In a great sheepskin coat such
as Cypriotes wear in winter, and seat
ed on the head of one of his own bar
rela
"Tour pardon, knights," he said as he
scrambled nimbly to the ground! "The
roads In this country are such thaf.
although I have left nearly half my
load at Stangate, it has taken me four
long hours to come from the Abb?y
here, most of which time we have spent
in mud-holes that have wearied the
horses and, as I fear, strained the bigoted."
wheels of this crazy wagon. Still, here
we are at last, and, noble sir," he add
ed, bowing to Sir Andrew, "here too
is the wine that your son bought of
me."
"My nephew," interrupted Sir An
drew.
"Once more your pardon. I thought
from their likeness to you that these
knights" were your sons."
"Has he bought all that stuff?" asked
Sir Andrewâfor there were five tubs
on the wagon, besides one or two
smaller kegs and some packages wrap
ped In sheepskin.
"No, alas!" answered the Cypriote
ruefully, and shrugging his shoulders.
"Only two of them, Mavro. The rest
I took to the Abbey, for I' understood
the holy Prior to say that he would
purchase six casks, but it seems that
it was but three he needed."
"He said three," put in Wulf.
"Did he, sir? Then doubtless the
error was mine, who speak your tongue
but ill. So I must drag the rest back
again over the accursed roads," and
he made another grimace. "Yet I will
ask you, sir." he* added to Sir Andrew,
"to lighten the load a little by accept
ing this small keg of the old sweet
vintage that grows on the slopes of
Trooidos."
"I remember it well," said Sir An
drew, with a smile; "but, friend, I do
not wish to take "your wine for noth
ing."
At these words the face of Georgios
beamed.
"What, noble sir," he exclaimed, "do
you know my land of Cyprus? Oh, then
indeed I kiss your hands, and surely
you will not affront} me by refusing
this little present? Indeed, to be frank,
I can afford to lose its price, who have
done a good trade, even here in Es
sex."
"As you will," said Sir Andrew. "I
thank you, and perhaps you have oth
er things to sell."
"I have indeed a few embroideries if
this most gracious lady would be
pleased to look at them. Some carpets
also, such as the Moslems used to pray
on In the name of their false prophet,
Mahomet," and turning, he spat upon
the ground.
"I perceive you are a Christian,"
said Sir Andrew. "Yet, although I
fought against them, I have known
many a good Mussulman. Nor do I
think it necessary to spit at the name
of Mahomet, who to my mind was a
great man, deceived by the artifice
of Satan."
"Neither do I," said Godwin re
flectively. "It's true servants should
fight the enemies of the cross and pray
for their souls, not spit at them."
The merchant looked at them curi
ously, fingering the silver crucifix that
hung upon his breast. "The captors
of the Holy City thought otherwise,"
he said, "when they rode Into the
Mosque El Aksa up to their horses'
knees in blood and I have been taught
otherwise. But the times grow liberal,
and, after all, what right has a poor
trader whose mind, alas! is set more
on gain than on the sufferings of tha
blessed son of Mary," and he crossed
himself, "to form a judgment upon
such high matters? Pardon me, I ac
cept your reproof, who perhaps am
Yet, had they but known it, this
"reproof" was to save the life of many
a man that night.
"May I ask help with these pack
ages?" he went on, "as I cannot open
them here, and to move- the casks?
Nay, the little keg I will carry myself.
as I hope that you will taste of it at
your Christmas feast. It must be
gently handled, though I fear me that
ttfi&se roads of your will not improve
its quality." Then twisting it from
the end of the wain to his shoulder
in such a fashion that it remained up
right, he walked off lightly toward the
open door of the hall.
"For one not tall that man Is
strangely strong," thought Wulf, who
followed with a bale of carpets.
Then the other casks of wine were
stored away in the stone cellar be
neath the hall.
Leaving his servant, a silent, stupid
looking, dark-eyed fellow named Petros
-to bait the horses, Georgios entered
the hall and began to unpack his car
pets and embroideries with all the skill
of one who had been trained in the
bazaars of Cairo, Damascus, or Nicosia.
Beautiful things they were which he
had to show; broideries that dazzled
the eye and rugs of many hues yet soft
and bright as an otter's pelt. As Sir
Andrew looked at them, remembering
long dead days, his face softened.
"I will buy that rug," he said, "for
to a truth it might be one on which I
lay sick many years ago in the house
of Ayoub at Damascus. Nay, I haggle
not at the price. I will buy it." Then
he fell to thinking how, while lying on
such a rug (Indeed, although he knew
it not, it was the same), looking
through the rounded Beads of the
wooden lattice-work of his window, he
had first seen his Eastern wife walking
in the crange garden with her father
Ayoub. Afterward, still remembering
his youth, he began to talk of Cyprus,
and so time went on until the dark was
falling.
Now Georgios said that he must be
going, as he had sent back his guide
to Southminster, where the man de
sired to eat his Christmas feast. So the
reckoning was paidâit was a long one
âand while the horses were harnessed
to the wain the merchant bored holes
in the little cask of wine and set spigots
in them bidding them all to be sure
to drink thereof that night. Then call
ing down good fortune on them for
their kindness and liberality, he made
his salaams in the Eastern fashion,
and departed, accompanied by Wulf.
Within five minutes there was a
sound of shouting, and Wulf was back
again saying that the wheel of the wain
had broken at the first turn, so that
now It was lying upon its side In the
courtyard. Sir Andrew and Godwin
went out to see to the matter, and
there they found Georgios wringing
his hands, as only an Eastern mer
chant can, and cursing in some foreign
tongue.
"Noble knights," h- said, "what am I
to do? Already It is nearly dark, and
how I shall find my way up yonder
steep hill I know not. As for the price
less broideries, I suppose they must
stay here for the night, since that
wheel cannot be mended till to-mor
row "
"As you and your servant had best
do also," said Sir Andrew kindly.
"Come, man, do not grieve; we are used
to broken axles here in Essex, and you
and your servant may as well eat your
Christmas dinners at Steeple as in
Southminster."
"I thank you, Sir Knight; I thank
you. But why should I, who am but a
merchant, thrust myself upon your no
ble company? Let me stop outside with
my man, Petros, and dine wiÂ»h your
servants in that barn, where I see they
are making ueady their food."
"By no means," answered Sir An
drew. "Leave your servant with my
people, who will look after him, and
come you into the hall, and tell me
some more of Cyprus till our Christ
mas meat is ready, which will be soon.
Fear not for your goods; they will be
placed under cover."
"All unworthy as I am, I obey," an
swered the polite Georgios. "Petros. do
you understand? This noble lord gives
us hospitality for the night. His serv
ants will show you where to eat and
sleep, and help you with your horses."
The man, who, he explained, was a
Cyprioteâa fisherman in summer and
a muleteer in winterâbowed, and fix
ing his dark eyes upon those of his
master, spoke in some foreign tongue.
"You hear what he says, the silly fel
low?" said Georgios. "What? You
do not understand Greekâonly Arabic?
Well, he asks me to give him money to
pay for his dinner and his night's lodg
ing. You must forgive him, for al
though he can speak your language,
he is but a simple peasant, and cannot
understand that any one may be lodged
and fed without payment. I will ex
plain to him, the pig!" And explain he
did in a shrill, high notes, of which no
one could understand a word. "There.
Sir Knight, I do not think he will of
fend you so again. Ah! look. He is
walk'ng Offâhe is sulky. Well, let him
alone, he will be back for his dinner,
the pig! Oh, the wet and the wind! A
Cypriote does not mind them in his
sheepskins, in which he will sleep even
in the snow."
So, Georgios. still declaiming upon
the shortcomings of his. servant, they
went back into the hall. Here the
conversation soon turned upon other
matters, such as the differences be
tween the creeds of the Greek and
Latin churchesâa subject upon which
he seemed to be an expertâand the
fear of the Christians in Cyprus lest
Saiadin should attempt to capture that
Island.
At length 5 o'clock came, and
Georgios having first been taken to the
lavatoryâit was but a stone troughâ
to wash his hands, was led to the din
ner, or rather to the supper table
which stood upon a dais in front of
the entrance to the solar. Here places
wtre laid for sixâSir Andrew, his
nephews, Rosamund, the chaplain,
Matthew, who celebrated masses In
the church and ate at the hall on
fedst days, and the Cypriote merchant.
Georgios himself. Below the dais and
between it and the fire was another
table, at which were already gathered
twelve guests, being the chief tenants
of Sir Andrew and the reeves of his
outlying lands. On most days the ser
vants of the house, with the hunts
men, swineherds and others sat at a
third table beyond the fire. But as
nothing could stop these from growing
drunk on good liquor at a feast, and
though many ladies thought little of
it. there was no sin that Rosamund
hated so much as this, now their tord
sent them to eat and drink at their
ease in . the barn, which stood in the
ccurtyard with Its back to the moat.
When all had taken their seats ths
chaplain said grace and the meal be
gan. It was rude but very plentiful.
First, borne in by the cook on a wooden
platter, came a great codfish, whereof
he helped portions to each in turn, lay
ing them on their "trenchers" âthat is,
large slices of bread âwhence they ate
them with the spoons that were given
to each. After the fish appeared the
meats, of which there were many
sorts, served on silver spits. These
included fowls, partridges, duck, and,
chief of all, a great swan, that the
tenants greeted by knocking their
horn mugs upon the table, after
which came the pastries and with
them the nuts and apples. For drink
ale was served at the lower table. On
this" dais, however, they drank some
of the black wine which Wulf had
broughtâthas is, except Sir Andrew
and Rosamund, the former because
he dared not and the latter because
she had always hated any drink but
waterâa dtelike that came to her.
doubtless, with her Eastern blood.
Thus they grew merry, for their
guest proved himself a cheerful fel
low, who told them many stories of
love and war, for he seemed to know
much of loves and to have been in
sundry wars. At these even Sir An
drew, forgetting his ailments and
forebodings, laughed, while Rosa
mund looked more beautiful than ever
in the gold-starred veil and the broid
ered tunic which the brethren had
given her, listened to them, smiling
somewhat absently. At last the feast
drew toward its end, when suddenly,
as though struck by a sudden recol
lection, Georgios exclaimed:
"The wine! The liquid amber from
Trooidos! I had forgotten it. Nobis
knight, have I your leave to draw?"
"Aye. excellent merchant." an
swered Sir Andrew. "Certainly you
can draw your own wine."
So Georgios arose and took a large
jug and a silver tankard from thesideboard where such things were dis
played. With these he went to the
little keg which, it will be remem
bered, had been stood ready upon the
â¢.trestles, and bending over it, while he
drew the spigots, filled the vessels to
fhe brim. Then he beckoned to a
reeve sitting at the lower table to
.bring him a leather jack that stood
upon the board. Having rinsed it out
with wine, he filled that also, handing
it with the jug to the reeve to drink
their lord's health on this Yule night.
'The silver vessel he bore back to the
high table and with his own hand
'filled the horn cups of all present,
â¢ Rosamund alone excepted, for. she
would touch none, although he
'pressed her hfird and looked vexed at
. her 'refusal. Indeed, it was because

followed, even Sir Andrew drinking a
little from his cup, which was three
parts filled with water. Then fol
lowed a long murmur of satisfaction.
-Wine! It is nectar!" said Wulf.
. "Aye." put in the chaplain, Matthew;
Adam might have drunk this in the*
garden. ' while from the lower table
oame Jovial shouts of praise of this
smooth, creamlike vintage.
Certainly that wine was both rich
and strong. Thus, after his sup of it,
a veil seemed as it were to fall on the
mind of Sir Andrew and cover it up. It
.lifted again, and lo! his brain was full
of memories and foresights. -Jircum
stances which he had forgotten for
many years came back to him. al
together, like a crowd of children
tumbling out to play. These passed,
and he grew suddenly afraid. Yet
*hat had he to fear that night? The
gates across the moat were locked and
guarded. Trusty men, a score or more
of them, ate in his outbuildings with
in those gates; while others,, still more
trusted, sat in his hall; and on his right
hand and **n his left were those two
strong and valiant knights. Sir God
win and Sir Wulf. No, there was noth
ing to fearâand yet he felt afraid. Sud
denly he heard a voice speak. It was
Rosamund's; and she said:
"Why is there such silence, father?
A while ago I heard the servants ?nd
bondsmen carousing in the barn; now
they arc stiil as death. Oh. and look!
Are all here drunken? Godwinâ"
But as she spoke Godwin's head fell
. forward on the board, while Wulf rose,
. half drew sword, then threw his
arm about the neck of the priest, and
sank with him to the ground. As it
was with these, so it seemed with all,
for folk rocked to and fro. then sank
to sleep, every one of them, save the
merchant Georgios, who rose to call
another toast.
"Stranger," said Sir Andrew, in a
heavy voice, "your wine is very
strong."
"It would seem so. Sir Knight," he
answered, "but I will wake them from,
their wassail." Springing from th*
dais lightly as a cat, he ran down the
hall, srying, "Air is what they need.
Air! ' Now, coming to the door he
threw it open, and. drawing a silver
whistle from his robe, blew it long
and loud. "What," he laughed, "do
they still sleep? Why, then, I must
give a toast that will rouse them all,"
and seizing a horn mug, he waved it
a,nd shouted:
"Arouse you, ye drunkards, and
drink to the Lady Rose of the World,
Princess of Baalbec, and niece to my
royal master, Yusuf Salah-ed-din, who
semis me to lead her to him!"
vÂ° h ' father -" shrieked Rosamund,
the wine was drugged and we are
betrayed."
As the words passed her lips there
rosy the sound of running feet, and
through the open door of the far end
of the hall burst in a score of armed
men. Then at last Sir Andrew saw
and understood.
With a roar of rage like that of a
wounded lion, he seized his daughtei>
and dragged her back with him down
the passage into the solar, where a
Ire burned and lights had been lit
ready for their retiring, flinging to
and bolting the door behind them.
"Swift," he said, as he tore his gown
from him., "there is no escape, but at
least I can die fighting for you. Give
me my mail."
She snatched the hauberk from the
wall, and while they thundered at the
door, did it on to himâaye, and his
6ti i helm aiso, and gave him his long
sword and his shield.
"Now," he said, "help me." And
they thrust the oak table forward, and
overset It in front of the door, and
threw the chairs and stools on either
side, that men might stumble on them.
rhere Is a bow," he said, "and you
can use il as I have taught you. Get
to one side and out of reach of the
sword sweeps, and shoot past me as
tney rush: it may stay one of them.
Oh. that Godwin and Wulf were here
and we would still learn these Paynlm
;dogs a lesson!"
Rosamund made no answer but there
'came into her mind a vision of the
agony of Godwin and of Wulf should
they ever awake again to learn what
had chanced to her and them. She
looked around. Against the wall stood
a little desk, at which Godwin was
' wont write ' and on jt 'ay Pen and
parchnjent. She seized them, and as
the door gave slowly Inward,
sprawled:
"Follow me to Saladin. In that hope
I live on. Rosamund."
The.\ as the stout door at length
crashed inward she turned what she I
had written face downward on the
desk, and seizing the bow, set an ar
row on its string. Now it was down
and on rushed the mob up the six feet
of narrow passage. At the end of it
in front of the overturned table, they
halted suddenly. For theVe before
before them, skull-emblazoned, shield
on arm, his long sword lifted, and a
terrible wrath burning in his eyes,
stood the old knight, like a wulf at
bay, and by his side, bow in hand, the
beauteous Lady Rosamund, clad in
all her festal broideries.
"Yield you!" cried a voice. By way
of answer the bowstring twanged and
an arrow sped home to its feathers
through the throat of the speaker, so
that he went down, grabbing at it, and
spoke no more forever.
As he fell clattering to the floor, Sir
Andrew cried in a great voice:
"We yield not to pagan dogs and poi
soners. A d'Arcy! A d'Arcy! Meet
d'Arcy, meet Death!"
Thus for the last time did old Sir An
drew utter the warcry of his race,
which he had feared would never pass
his lips again. His prayer had been
heard, and he was to die as he had de
sired.
"Down with him and seize the Prin
cess!" said a voice. It was that of
Georgios, no longer humble with a
merchant's obsequious whine, but
speaking in tones of cold command and
In the Arabic tongue.
For a moment the swarthy mob hung
back, as well they might In face of that
glittering sword. Then With a cry of
"Saleh-ed-diri! Saleh-ed-din!" on they
surged, with flashing spears and scim
etars. The overthrown table was in
front of them, and one leaped upon its
edge, but as he leaped, the old knight,
all his years and sickness forgotten
now, sprang forward and struck down
ward, so heavy a blow that in the
darkling mouth of the passage the
sparks streamed out, and where the
Saracen's head had been appeared his
heels. Back Sir Andrew stepped again
to win space for his sword-play, while
round the ends of the table broke two
fierce-faced men. At one of them
Rosamund shot with her bow and the
arrow pierced his thigh, but as he fell
he struck with his keen scimetar and
shore the end off the bow, so that it
was useless. The second man caught
his foot In the bar of the oak chair,
which he did not see, and went down
prone, while Sir Andrew, taking no
heed of him, mshed with a shout at
the crowd who followed, and catching
their blows upon his shield, rained
down others so desperate that, being
hampered by their very number, they
gave before him, and staggered back
along the passage.
"Guard your right, father," cried
Rosamund. He sprang round, to see
the Saracen who had fallen, on his
feet again. At him he went, nor did
the man wait the onset, but turned to
fly, only to find a haven in the house
of Death, for the great sword caught
him between neck and shoulders. Now
a voice cried:
"We make poor sport with this old
lion, and lose men. Keep clear of his
claws, and whelm him with spear
casts."
But Rosamund, who understood their
tongue, sprang in front of him, and
answered in Arabic:
"Aye, through my breast; and go,
tell that tale to Salah-ed-din!"
Then clear and calm was heard the
command of Georgios. "He who harms
a hair of the Princess dies. Take them
both living if ye may, but lay no hand
on her. Stay, let us talk."
So they ceased from their onslaught
and began to consult together.
Rosamund touched her father and
pointed to the man who lay upon the
floor with an arrow through his thigh.
He was struggling to his knees, raising
the heavy scimetar in his hand. Sir
Andrew lifted his sword as a husband
man lifts a stick to kill a rat, then he
let it fall again, saying:
"I fight not the wounded. Drop that
steel, and get you back to your own
folk."
The fellow obeyed himâyes, and even
torched the floor with his forehead in
salaam as he crawled away, for he
knew that he had been given his life,
and that the deed was noble toward
him who had planned a coward's stroke.
Then Georgios stepped forward, no
longer the same Georgios who had sold
poisoned wine and Eastern embroid
eries, but a proud-looking, high-browed
Saracen, clad in the mall which he
wore beneath his merchant's robe, and
in place of the crucifix, wearing on his
breast a great star-shaped jewel, the
emblem of his house and rank.
"Sir Andrew," he said, "hearken to
me, I pray you. Noble was that act,"
and he pointed to the wounded mam bfe
ing drawn away by his fellows, "and
noble has been your defenseâwell
worthy of your lineage and your
knighthood. It is a tale that my mas
ter," and he bowed as he said the
word, "will love to hear If It pleases Al
lah that we return to him in safety.
Also you will think that I have played
a knave's trick upon_you, overcoming
the might of those gallant knights, Sir
Godwin and Sir Wulf, sÂ»ot with sword
blows, but with drugged wine, and
treating all your servants in like fash
ion, since not one of them can shake
oft its fumes before to-morrow's light.
So indeed it Is âa very scurvy trick,
which I shall remember with shame to
my life's end, and that perchance may
yet fall back upon my head in blood
and vengeance. Yet bethink you how
we stand, and forgive us. We are but a
little company of men in your great
country, hidden, as it were, In a den
of lions, who, if they saw us, would
slay us without mercy. That, Indeed,
is a small thing, for what are our lives,
of which ycur sword has taken tithe.
Rnd not only yours, but those of the
twiii brethren on the quay by the
water?"
"I thought, it," broke in Sir Andrew,
contemptuously. "Indeed, the deed
was worthy of youâtwenty or more
men against two."
Georgios held up his hand.
"Judge us not harshly," he said,
speaking slowly, who for his own
ends wished to gain time, "you who
have read the letter of our lord. See
you, these were my commands: To
secure the Lady Rose of the World as
best I might, but if possible without
bloodshed. Now I was reconnoitering
the country with a troop of the sail
ors from my ship, who are but poor
fighters, and a few of my own peo
ple, when thy spies brought me word
that she had ridden forth attended by
only twq men, and surely I thought
that already she was in my hands.
But the knights foiled me by strategy
and strength, and you know the end
of it. So afterward my messenger
presented the letter, which, indeed,
should have been done at first. The
letter failed also, for neither you, nor
the Princess"âand he bowed to
Rosamundâ"could be bought. More,
the whole country was awakened;
you were surrounded with termed men;
the knightly brethren kept watch and
ward over you, and you were about
to fly to London, where it would have
been hard to snare you. Therefore,
because I must, I âwho am a Prince
and Emir, who also, although you re
member it not. have crossed swords
with you in my youth; yes, at Ha
rencâbecame a dealer in drugged
wine.
"Now, hearken. Yield you, Sir An
drew, who,have done enough to make
your name a song for generations,
and accept thf love of Salah-ed-din,
whose word you have, the word that,
as you know well, cannot be broken,
which I, the Lord El-Hassanâfor no
meaner man has been sent upon this
errandâplight to you afresh. Yield
you, and save your life, and live on in
honor, clinging to your own faith, till
Azrael takes you from the pleasant'
fields of Baalbec to the waters of
paradiseâif such there be for infidels,
however gallant.
"For now this deed must be done.
Did we return without the Princess
Rose of the World we should die, every
one of us, and did we offer her harm
or insult, then more horribly than I can
tell you. This is no fancygof a great
King that drives him on tcr*the steal-
lngr of a woman, although she be of his
own high blood. The voice of God has
spoken to Salad-ed-din by the mouth
of his angel Sleep. Thrice has Allah
spoken in dreams, telling him who is
merciful, and through your daughter
and her nobleness alone can countless
lives be saved; therefore, sooner than
she should escape him, he would lose
even the half of his empire. Outwit us,
defeat us now, capture us, cause us to
be tortured and destroyed, and other
messengers would come to do his bid
dingâindeed, they are already on the
way. Moreover, it is useless to shed
more blood, seeing it is written in the
books that this lady. Rose of the
World, must -return to the East, where
she was begot, there to fulfill he,r des
tiny and save the lives of men."
"Then, Emir El-Hassan, I shall re
turn as a spirit," said Rosamund
proudly.
"Not so, Princess," he answered,
bowing, "for Allah alone has power
over your life, and It Is otherwise de
creed. Sir Andrew, the time grows
short, and I must fulfill my mission.
Will you take the peace of Salah-ed
din or force his servants to take your
life?"
The â¢ old knight listened, resting on
his reddened sword; then he lifted his
head and sqoke:
"I am aged and near my death, wine
seller Georgios, or Prfnce El-Hassan,
whichever you may be. In my youth
I swore to make no pact with Paynims
and In my eld I will not break that
vow. When I can lift sword I will
defend my daughter, even against the
might of Salah-ed-din. Get to your
cowards' work again, and let things
go as God has willed them."
"Then, Princess," answered El-Has
san, "bear me witness throughout the
East that I am innocent of your fath
er's blood. On his own head be it, and
on yours," and for the second "time he
blew upon the whistle that hung
around his neck.
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
CHAPTER \n.
The Banner of Suladin.
As the echoes of Hassan's whistle
died away there was a crash among
the wooden shutters of the window be
hind them, and down into the room
leaped a long, lithe figure, holding an
ax aloft. Before Sir Andrew could turn
to see whence came the sound, that
ax dealt him a fearful blow, between
the shoulders which, although the ring
ed mail remained unshorn, shattered
his spine beneath. Down he fell, rolled
on to his back, and lay there, still able
to speak, and without pain, but help
less as a child, for he was paralyzed,
and never more would move hand or
foot or bead.
In the silence that followed he spoke
in a heavy voice, letting his eyes rest
upon the man who had struck him
down.
"A knightly blow truly; one worthy
of a Christian born who does murder
for Paynim pay! Traitor to God and
man, who have eaten my bread and
now slaughter me like an ox on my
hearthstone, may your end be even
worse, and at the hands of those you
serve."
The palmer Nicholas, for it was he,
although he no longer wore the palm
er's robe, slunk away muttering, and
was lost among the crowd in the pas
sage. Then, with a sudden and a bit
ter cry, Rosamund swooped forward,
as a bird swoons, snatched up the
brand her sire would never lift again,
and setting its hilt upon the floor, cast
herself forward. But the point never
touched her breast, for swiftly sprang
the Emir and struck the steel aside;
then, as she fell, caught her in his
arms.
"Lady," he said, loosing her very
gently. "Allah does not need you yet.
I have told you that it is not fated.
Now will you pass me your wordâfor
being of the blood of Salah-ed-din and
d'Arcy, you, too, cannot He âthat neith
er now nor afterward will you attempt
to harm yourself? If not. I must bind
you, which lam most loth to doâit Is
a sacrilege to which I pray you will not
force me."
"Promise. Rosamund," said the hol
low voice of her father, "and go to ful
fill your fate, for self-murder is a
crime, and the man Is right; it Is de
creed. I bid you promise."
"I promise," said Rosamund. "It is
your hour, my lord Hassan."
He bowed deeply and answered:
"I am satisfied and henceforth we are
your servants to obey. Princess, the
night air is bitter; you cannot travel
thus. In which chamber are your
garments?"
She pointed with her finger. A man
took a taper, and, accompanied by two
others, entered the place, to return
presently with their arms full of all the
apparel they could find. Indeed they
even brought her missal and the silver
crucifix that hung above her bed and
with it her leathern case of trinkets.
"Keep out the warmest cloak," said
Hassan, "and tie the rest up in those
carpets." -
So the rugs that Sir Andrew had
bought that day from the merchant
Georgios were made to serve as travel
ing bags to hold his daughter's gear.
Even in this hour of haste and danger
thought was taken for her comfort.
"Princess," said Hassan, bowing,
"my master, your uncle, sent you cer
tain Jewels of no mean value. Is it
your wish that they should accompany
you?"
Without lifting her eyes from her
dying father's face, Rosamund an
swered heavily:
"Where they are, there Ist them
bide. What have Ito do with Jewels?"
"Your will is my law," he said; "and
others will be found for you. Princess,
all is ready; we wait your pleasure."
"My pleasure? Oh, God, my pleas
ure!" exclaimed Rosamund in the same
drear voice, still staring at her father,
who lay before her on the ground.
"I cannot help it," said Hassan, an
swering the question in her eyes/ and
there was grief in his tone. "He would
not come, he brought it on himself,
though In truth I wish that accursed
Frank had not struck so shrewdly. If
you ask it, we will bear him with you;
but lady, it is idle to hide the truth
he is sped. I have studied medicine,
and I know." #
"Nay," said Sir Andrew from the
floor; "leave me nere. Daughter, we
must part awhile. As I stole his child
from Ayoub, so Ayoub's son steals my
child from me. Daughter, cling to the
faithâthat we may meet again."
"To the death," she answered.
"Be comforted," said Hassan. "Has
not Salad-ed-din passed his word that
except her own will or that of Allah
should change her heart, a cross-wor
shiper she may live and die. Lady,
for your own sake as well as ours, let
this sad farewell be brief. Begone, my
servants, taking these dead and
wounded with you. There are things
it Is not fitting that common eyes
should see."
They obeyed, end thp three of them
remained alone together. Then Rosa
mund knelt down beside her father,
and they whispered into each other's
ears. Hassan turned his back upon
them, and threw the corner of his cloak
over his head and eyes that he might
neither see them nor hear their voices
in this dread and holy hour of parting.
It would seem that they found some
kind of hope and consolation In itâat
least when Rosamund kissed him for
the last time, Sir Andrew smiled and
said:
"Yea, yes; it may all be for the best.
God will guard you, and his will be
done. But I forgot- Tell me, daugh
ter, which?"
Again she whispered into his ear.
and when he had thought a moment he
answered:
."Maybe you are right. I think that
is wisest for all three. And now on all
three of youâaye, and on your chil
dren's children's childrenâlet my bless
ing rest, as rest it shalL Come hither.
Emir."
Hassan heard him through his cloak,
and, uncovering, came.
"Say to Saladin, your master, that
he has been too strong for me, and naid
me back in my own coin. Well, had It
been otherwise, my daughter and I
must soon have parted, for death drew
near to me. At least it Is the decree of
God, to which I bow my head, trusting
there may be truth in that dream of
his, and that our sorrows, in some way
unforeseen, will bring blessings to our
brethren in the East. But to Saladin
say also that whatever his bigot faith
may teach, for Christian and for Pay
nim there is a meeting place beyond
the grave. Say that if aught of wrong
or insult is done toward this maiden
I swear by the God who made us both
that there I will hold him to account.
Now, since it must be so, take her and
go your'way, knowing that my spirit
follows after you and her; yes, and
that even In this world she will find
avengers."
"1 hear your words, and I will de
liver them," answered Hassan. "More,
I believe that they are true, and for
the rest you have the oath of Salah
ed-dinâaye, and Tf oath while she is
in my charge. T.arefore, Sir Andrew
d'Arcy, forgivflr-us, who are but the
instruments/. Allah, and die in peace."
"I, .who have so much to be forgiven,
forgive you," answered the old knight
slowly.
Then his eyes fixed themselves upon
his daughter's face with one long
searching look and closed.
"I think that he is dead." said Has
san. "May God be merciful and com
passionate, rest his soul!" And tak
ing a white garment from the wall he
flung it over him, adding, "Lady,
come."
Thrice Rosamund looked at the
shrouded figure on the floor; once she
wrung her hands and seemed about to
fall. Then, as though a thought
struck her, she lifted her father's
sword from where It lay, and gather
ing her strength, drew herself up and
passed like a queen down the blood
stained passage and the steps of the
solar. In the hall beneath waited the
band of Hassan, who bowed as she
cameâa vision of despairing loveli
ness, that held aloft a red and naked
sword. There, too, lay the drugged
men, fallen this way and that, and
among them Wulf across the table and
Godwin on the dais. Rosamund spoke.
"Are these dead or sleeping?"
"Have no fear," answered Hassan.
"By my hope of paradise, they do but
sleep and will awake ere morning."
Rosamund pointed to the renegade
Nicholasâhe that had struck down
her father from behind, who, an evil
look upon his face, stood apart from
the Saracens, holding in his hand a
lighted torch.
"What does this man with the
torch?" she asked.
"If you would know, lady." he an
swered with a sneer, "I wait till you
be out of it to fire the hall."
"Prince Hassan," said Rosamund.
"Is tnis a deed that great Saladin would
wish, to burn drugged men beneath
their own roof? Now, as you shall
answer to him. In the name of Saladin,
I, a daughter of his house, command
yen, strike the fire from that man's
hand, and in my hearing give you or
der that none should even think of
such an act of shame."
"What?" broke in Nicholas, "and
leave knights such as these, whose
quality you know" âand he pointed to
the brethrenâ"to follow in our path
and take our lives in vengeance? Why,
It Is madness!"
"Are you master here, traitor, or am
I?" asked the Lord Hassan in cold
contempt. "Let them follow if they
will and I for one shall rejoice to meet
knights so brave in open battle and
there give them their revenge. All," he
added, addressing the man who had
been disguised as a merchant's under
ling and who had drugged the men in
the barn as his master had drugged
those In the hall, and opened the moat
gate to the band. "Ali, stamp upon the
torch and guard that Frank till we
reach the boat lest the fool should raise
the country on us with his fires. Now,
Princess, are you satisfied?"
"Aye, having your word," she an
swered. "One moment, I pray you. I
would leave a token to my knights."
Then, while they watched her with
wondering eyes, she unfastened the
gold cross and chain that hung upon
her bosom and slipping the cross from
the chain, went to where Godwin lay
and placed It on his breast. Next, with
a swift movement, she wound the chain
about the silver hilt of Sir Andrew's
sword and, passing to Wulf, with one
strong, swift thrust, drove the point
Into the wood of the table so that it
stood before him âat once a cross, a
brand of battle and a lady's token.
"His grandsire wore it," she said in
Arabic, "when he leaped on the walls
of Jerusalem. It Is my last gift to
him." But the Saracens muttered and
turned pale at . these words of evil
omen.
Then taking the hand of Hassan, who
stood watching her white, inscrutable
face, with never a word or a backward
look, .she swept down the length of the
long hall and out Into the night be
yond.
"It would have been well to take my
counsel and fire the place, or at least
to cut the throats of all within It,"
said the man Nicholas to his guard Ali
as they walked with the rest. "If I
know aught of these brethren, cross
and sword will soon be hard upon our
track and men's 'ives must pay the
price of such soft folly." And he
shivered as though in fear.
"It may be so, spy," answered the
Saracen, looking at him with som
ber, contemptuous eyes. "It may be
that your life will pay the price."
Wulf was dreaming, dreaming that
he stood on his head upon a wooden
board, as once he had seen a juggler
do, which turned round one way while
he turned round the other, till at
length some one shouted at him, and
he tumbled off the board and hurt
himself. Then he awoke to hear a
voice shouting surely enoughâthe
voice of Matthew, the chaplain of
Steeple Church.
"Awake!" said the voice. "In God's
name, I conjure you, awake!"
"What is it?" he said, lifting his
head sleepily, and becoming con
scious of a dull pain across his fore
head.
"It Is that death and the devil have
been here. Sir Wulf."
"Well, they are often near together.
But I thirst. Give me water."
A serving-woman, pallid, dishev
eled, heavy-eyed,* who was stumbling
to and fro, lighting torches and ta
pers, for it was still dark, brought it
to him in a leathern jack, from which
he drank deeply.
"That is better," he said. Then his
eye feJl upon the bloody sword fixed
point downward in the wood of the
table before him. and he exclaimed,
"Mother of God! what Is that? My
uncle's silver-hllted sword, red with
blood, and Rosamund's gold pin upon
the hilt! Priest, where is the Lady
Rosamund?"
"Gone," answered the chaplain in
a voice that sounded like a groan.
"The women woke and found her
gone, and Sir Andrey lies dead or
dying in the solar âbut now I have
shriven himâand oh! we have all
been drugged. Look at them!" And
he waved his hand toward the re
cumbent forms. "I say that the devil
has been here."
Wulf sprang to his feet with an
oath.
"The devil! Ah! I have It now.
You mean the Cyprian chapman
Georgios. He who sold wine."
"He who sold drugged wine."
echoed the chaplain, "has stolen the
Lady Rosamund."
Then Wulf seemed to go mad.
"Stolen Rosamund over our sleeping
carcases! Stolen Rosamund with
never a blow struck by us to save her'
O Christ, that such a thing should
be! O Christ, that I should live to
hear it!" And he, the mighty man,
the knight of skill and strength,
broke down and wept like a yery
child. But not for long, for presently
he shouted in a voice of thunder:
"Awake, ye drunkards! Awake,
and learn what has chanced to us.
Tour lady Rosamund has been raped
away while we were lost in sleep!"
At the sound of that great voice a
tall form arose from' the floor and
staggered toward him, holding a gold
cross in its hand.
"What awful words are those I
heard you say, my brother?" asked
Godwin, who, pale and dull-eyed,
rocked to and fro before him. Then
he, too, saw the red sword and stared,
first at it and next at the gold eros/
in his hand. "My uncle's sword, Ros
amund's chain, Rosamund's cross!
Where, then, is Rosamund?"
"Gone! gone! gone!" cried Wulf.
"Tell him, priest."
So the chaplain told him all he
knew.
"Thus have we kept our oaths,"
went on Wulf. "Oh, what can we do
now, save die for very shame?"
"Nay," answered Godwin, dream
lngly; "we can live on to save hey.
See, these are her tokensâthe cross
for me, the blood stained sword for
you and about its hilt the chain, a
symbol of her slavery. Now both of
us must bear the cross; both of us
must wield the sword, and both of'us
must cut the chain, or if we fail, then
die."
"You rave," said Wulf; "and little
wonder. Here, drink water. Would
that we had never touched aught else,
as she did, and desired that we should
do. What said you of my uncle,
priest? Dead, or only dying? Nay,
answer not. let us see. Come, broth
er." Then together they ran, or
reeled, torch in hand, along the pass
age.
Wulf saw the bloodstains on the
floor and laughed savagely.
"The old man made a good fight,"
he said, "while like drunken brutes,
we slept."
They were there, and before them,
beneath the white, shroud-llke cloak,
lay Sir Andrew, the steel helm on his
head and his face beneath it even
whiter than the cloak. At the sound
of their footsteps he opened his eyes.
"At length, at length," he muttered.
"Oh, how many years, have I waited
for you? Nay. be silent, for I do not
know how long my strength will last,
but li3tenâkneel down and listen."
So they knelt on either side of him
and in quick, fierce word he told them
allâof the drugging, of the fight, of
the long parley carried on to give the
palmer knave time to climb to the win
dow; of his cowardly blow, and of what
chanced afterward. Then his strength
seemed to fail him, but they poured
milk down his throat, and it came back
again.
"Take horse swiftly," he gasped,
pausing now and again to rest, "and
rouse the countryside. 'There is still a
chance. Nay, seven hours have gone
by; there is no chance. Their plans
were too well laid; by now they will
be at sea. So hear me. Go to Pales
tine. There is money for your faring
in my chest, but go alone, with no
company, for in time of peace these
would betray you. Godwin, draw off
this ring from my finger, and with it
as a token, find out Jebal, the black
sheik of the Mountain Tribe at Mas
yaf on Lebanon, and bid him remember
the vow- made to Andrew d'Arcy, the
English knight. If any can aid you, it
will be Jebal, who hates the houses of
Nur-ed-din and of Ayoub. So. I charge
you, let nothingâl say nothingâturn
you aside from seeking him.
"Afterward act as God will guide you.
If he still lives, kill that traitor Nicho
las and Hugh Lozelle, but, save in
open war, spare the Emir Hassan, who
did but do his duty as an Eastern
reads it, and has shown some mercy,
for he could have slain or burnt us all.
This riddle has been hard for m** yet
now, in my dying hour, I see Its an
swer. I think that Saladln did not
dream in vain. Keep brave hearts, for
I think also that at Masyaf yr>" will
find friends, and that things will go
well, and our sorrows bear *ood fruit."
"What is that you said? She left you
my father's sword, Wulf? Then wield
it bravely, winning honor for our name.
She left you the cross, Godwin? Wear
it worthily, winning glory for the Lord
and salvation to your soul. Remember
what you have sworn. Whate'er be
fall, bear no bitterness to one another
and be true to one another and to her,
your lady, so that when at last you
make your reports to me before high
heaven, I may have no cause to bo
ashamed of you, my nephews, Godwin
and Wulf."
For a moment he was silent, until hia
face lit up as with a great gladness
and he cried in a loud, clear voice,
"Beloved wife, I hear you! O God, I
come!"
Then, though his eyes stayed open
and the glad smile still rested upon hlsV
face, his jaw fell.
Thus died Sir Andrew d'Arcy.
Still kneeling on either side of him,
the brethren watched the end and, as
his spirit passed, bowed their heads In
prayer.
"We have seen a great death," said
Godwin presently. "Let us learn a les
son from it and when our time comes
we may die like him." >
"Aye," answered Wulf, springing to
his feet, "but first let us take venge
ance for it. Why, what Is this?
Rosamund's writing! Read it, God
win."
Godwin took the parchment and read:
"Follow me to Saladin. In that hope I
live on."
"Surely we will follow you, Rosa
mund," he cried aloud. "Follow you
through life to death or victory."
Then he threw down the paper and,
calling for the chaplain to come to
watch the body, they ran into the hall.
By this time about half of the folk
were awake from their drugged sleep,
while others who had been doctored by
the man Ali in the barn came stag
gering into the hall, wild-eyed, white
faced and holding their hands to their
heads and hearts. They were so
and bewildered, indeed, that it was
difficult to make them understand what
had chanced and when they learned
the >ruth the most of them could only
groan. Still a few were found strong
enough in wit and body to grope their
way through the darkness and the
falling snow to Stangate Abbey, to
Southminster and to the houses of
their neighbors, although of these there
were none near, praying that every
true man would arm and ride to help
them in the hunt. Also Wulf, cursing
the priest Matthew and himself that
he had not thought of It before, called
him from his prayers by his dead uncle
and charged him to climb the church
tower as swiftly as he could and set
light to the beacon that was laid ready
there.
Away he went, taking flint, steel
and tinder with him, and ten minutes
later the blaze was flaring furiously
above the roof of Steeple Church,
warning all men of the need of help.
Then they armed, saddled such horses
as they had, among them the three
that had been left there by the mer
chant GeorgMs, and gathered all of
them that were not too sick to ride or
run, in the courtyard of the hall. But
as yet their haste availed them little,
for the moon was down. Snow fell
also and the night was still black as
death âso black that a man could
scarcely see the hand he held before
his face. So they must wait, and wait
they did, eating their hearts out with
grief and rage and bathing their ach
ing brows in snow and ice cold water.
At length the dawn began to break,
and by its first gray light they saw
two men mounted and afoot feeling
their way through the snow, shouting
to each as they came to know what
dreadful thing had happened at
Steeple. Quickly the tidings spread
among them that Sir Andrew was
slain, the Lady Rosamund snatched
away by Paynims, while all who feast
ed In the place had been drugged withpoisoned wine by a man whom they
believed to be a merchant. So soon as
a baud was got togetherâperhaps
thirty men In allâand there was light
to stir by, they set out and began to
rch, though where to look they
knew not, for the snow had covered
up all traces of their foes.
"One thing is certain," said God
win, "they must have come by water."
"Aye," answered Wulf; "and landed
hard by, since, had they far to go
they would have taken the horses, and
must run the risk of losing their path
in the darkness. To the staithe! Let
us try Steeple Staithe!"
So on they went across the meadow
to the creek. It lay but three bow
shots distant. At first they could see
nothing, for the snow covered the
stones of the little pier, but presently
a man cried out that the lock of the
watpr-house, in which the brethren
kept their fishing boat, was broken,
and next minute, that the boat was
gone.
"She was small; she would hold but
six men," cried a voice. "So great a
company could never have crowded
into her."
"Fool!" one answered, "there may
have been other boats."
So they looked again, and beneath
the thin coating of rime, found a mark
in the mud by the Staithe, made by
the prow of a large boat, and not far
from it a hole in the earth into which
a peg had been driven to make her
fast. Now the thing seemed clear
enough, but it was to be made yet
clearer, for presently, even through the
driving snow, the quick eye of Wulf
caught sight of some glittering thing
which hung to the edge of a clump of
dead reeds. A man with a lance lifted
it out at his command, and gave It to
him.
"I thought so," he said in a heavy
voice; "it is a fragment of that star
wrought veil that was my Christmas
gift to Rosamund, and she has torn it
off and left it here to show us her road.
To St. Peter's-on-the-Wall! To St. Pe
ter's, 1 say, for there the boats or
ship must pass, and maybe that in the
darkness they have not yet won out
to sea."
So they turned their horses' heads,
and those of them that were mounted
rode for St. Peter's by the inland path
that runs through Steeple St. Lawrence
and Bradwell town, while those who
were not, started to search along the
Saltings and the river banks. On they
galloped through the falling snow, God
win and Wulf leading the way on their
horses, whilst behind them thundered
an ever-gathering train of knights,
squires and yeomen, who had seen the
beacon flare on Steeple tower, or
learned the tale from messengersâyes,
and even of monks from Stangate and
chapmen from Southminster.
Hard they rode, but the lanes were
heavy with fallen snow and mud be
neath, and the way was far, so thai an
hour had gone by before Bradwell was
left behind, and the shrine of St. Chad
lay but a half a mile in front. Now of
a sudden the snow ceased, and a strong
northerly wind springing up, drove the
thick mist before it and left the sky
bright and blue behind. Still riding in
this mist, they pressed on to where the
old tower loomed up in front of them,
then drew rein and waited.
"What is that?" said Godwin pres
ently, pointing to a great, dim thing
upon the vapor-hidden sea.
As he spoke a strong gust of wind
tore away the last veils of mist, reveal
ing the red face of the risen sun. and
not a hundred yards away from themâ
for the tide was highâthe tall masts
of a great galley creeping out to set
beneath her bank of oars. As they
stared the wind caught her, and upon
.he mainmast rose her bellying sail,
while a shout of laughter told them
that they themselves were seen. They
shook their swords in the madness of
their rage, well knowing who was
aboard that galley; while to the fore
peak ran up the yellow flag of Saladin,
streaming there like gold in the golden
sunlie-ht.
Nor was this all, for on the high
poop appeared the tall shape of Rosa
mund herself, and on one side of her,
clad now in coat of mail and turban,
the Emir Hassan, whom they had
known as the merchant Georgios. and
on the other, a stout man. also clad in
mail, who at that distance looked like
a Christian knight. Rosamund
stretched out her arms toward them.
Then suddenly she sprang forward as
though she would throw herself Into
the sea had not Hassan caught her by
the arm ahd held her back, while the
other man, who was watching, slipped
between her and the bulwark.
In his fury and despair Wulf drove
his horse Into the water till the waves
broke about his middle, and there, since
he could go no further, sat shaking
"Fear not! We follow! we follow!"
in such a voice of thunder that even
through the wind and across the ever
widening space of foam his words may
have reached the ship. At least Rosa
mund seemed to hear them, for she
tossed up her arms as though In token.
But Hafean, one hand pressed upon
his heart and the other upon his fore
head, only bowed thrice in courteous
fare well.
Then, the great Bail filled, the oars
were drawn In, and the vessel swept
swiftly across the dancing waves, till
at length she vanished, and they could
only see the sunlight playing on the
golden banner of Saladin which floated
from her truck.
CHAPTER vm.
The Widow Masouda.
Many months had gone by since the
brethren sat upon their horses that
winter morning, and from the shrine
of St. Peter's-on-the-Wall, at the
mouth of the Blackwater In Essex,
had watched with anguished hearts the
galley of Saladin sailing southward;
their love and cousin, Rosamund,
standing a prisoner on the deck. Hav
ing no ship in which to follow herâ
and this, Indeed, it would have been
too late to doâthey thanked those who
had come to aid them and returned
home to Steeple, where they had mat
ters to arrange. As they went they
gathered from this man and that tid
ings which made the whole tale clear
to them.
They learned, for Instance, then and
afterward, that the galley that had
been thought to be a merchantman had
put into the river Crouch by design,
feigning an injury to her rudder, and
that on Christmas eve she had moved
up with the tide and anchored in the
Blaofevater about three miles from its
mouth. Thence a great boat, which
she towed behind her, and
which was afterward found
abandoned, had rowed in the
dusk, keeping along the further
shore to avoid observation, to the
mouth of Steeple Creek, which she de
seended at dark, making fast to the
Staithe. unseen of any. Her crew of
thirty men or more, guided by the false
palmer Nicholas, next hid themselves
in the grove of trees about fifty yards
from the house, where traces of them
were found afterward, waiting for the
signal and, if that were necessary,
ready to attack and burn the hall while
all men feasted there. But it was not
necessary, since the cunning scheme
of the drugged wine, which only an
Eastern could have devised, succeeded.
So it happened that the only man they
had to meet in arms was one old
knight, of which doubtless they were
glad, as their numbers being few, they
wished to avoid a desperate battle,
wherein many must fall, and, if help
came, they might be destroyed to the
last man.
W hen all was over they led Rosa
mund to the boat, felt their way down
the creek, towing behind them the
little skiff which they had taken from
the water-house, laden with their dead
and wounded. This, as the brethren
learned afterward, proved the most
perilous part of their adventures,
since it was very dark and came on to
snow; twice they grounded upon mud
banks. Still guided by Nicholas, who
had studied the river, they reached
the galley before dawn and with the
first light weighed anchor and very
cautiously rowed out to sea. The rest
is known.
Two days later, since there was no
time to spare, Sir Andrew was buried
with great pomp at Stangate Abbey,
in the same tomb where lay the heart
of his brother, the father of the
brethren, who had fallen in the East
ern wars. After he had been laid to
rest amid much lamentation and in
the presence of a great concourse of
people, for the fame of these strange
happenings had traveled far and wide,
his will was opened. Then it was
found that with the exception of cer
tain sums of money left to his neph
ews, a legacy to Stangate Abbey and
another to be devoted to masses for
the repose of his soul, with some gifts
to his servants and the poor, all his
estate was devised to his daughter
Rosamund. The brethren, however,
or the survivor of them, held it in
trust on her behalf, with the charge
that they should keep watch and ward
over her and manage her lands till she
took a husband.
These lands, together with their own,
the brethren placed in the hands of
Prior John at Stangate, in the pres
ence of witnesses, to administer them
subject to the provisions of the will,
taking a tithe of the rents and profits
for his pains. The priceless jewels also
that had been sent by Saladin were
given into his keeping, and a receipt
with a list of the same signed in dupli
cate deposited with a clerk at South
minster. This, indeed, was necessary,
seeing that none save the brethren and
the Prior knew of these Jewels, of
which, being of so great a value, it
was not safe to speak. Their affairs
arranged, having first made their wills
in favor of each other with remainder
to their heirs-at-law, since it was
scarcely to he hoped that both of them
would return alive from such a quest,
they received the communion, and
with it his blessing from the hands of
Prior John. Then early one morning,
before any were astir, they rode quietly
away to London.
Or* the top of Steeple Hill, sending
forward the servant who led the mule
laden with their baggageâthat same
mule which had been left by the spy
Nicholasâthey turned their horses'
heads to look in farewell on their home.
There to the north of them lav the
Blackwater, and to the west the parish
of Mayland, toward which the laden
barges crept along the stream to
Steeple Creek. Below was the wide
flat outlined with trees, and in it.
marked by the plantation where the
Saracens had hid, the hall and church
of Steeple, the home in which they had
grown from childhood to youth, and
from youth to man's estate in the com
pany of the fair, lost Rosamund, who
was the love of both, and whom both
went forth to seek. That past was all
behind them, and in front a dark and
troublous future, of which they could
not read the mystery nor guess the end.
Would they ever look on Steeple Hall
again? Were they who stood there
about to match their strength and
cburage against all the might of Sala
din, doomed to fail or gloriously to suc
ceed?
Through the darkness that shrouded
their forward path shone one bright
star of loveâbut for which of them did
that star shine, or was it perchance for
neither? They knew not. How could
they know aught save that the venture
seemed very desperate. Indeed, the
few to whom they had spoken of it
thought them mad. Yet they remem
bered the last words of Sir Andrew,
bidding them keep a high heart, since
he believed that things would yet go
well. It seemed to them, in trust, that
they were not quite alone âas though
his brave spirit companioned them on
their search, guiding their feet, with
ghostly counsel which they could not
hear. They remembered also their
oaths to him, to one another, and to
Rosamund; and In silent token that
they would keep them to the death,
pressed each other's hands. Then turn
ing their horses southward, they rode
forward with light hearts, not caring
what befell, if only at the last, living
or dead, Rosamund and her father
should, in his own words, find no cause
to be ashamed of them.
Through the hot haze, of a July
morning a dromon, as certain merchant
vessels of that time were called, might
have been seen drifting before a light
breeze into St. Georges Bay at Beirut,
on the coast of Syria. Cyprus, whence
she had sailed last, was not a hundred
miles away, yet she had taken six days
to do the journey, not on account of
stormsâof which there were none at
this time of year, but through lack of
wind to move her. Still, her captain
and the motley crowd of passengersâ
for the most part Eastern merchants
and their servants, together with a
number of pilgrims of all nations â
thanked God for so prosperous a voy
ageâfor in those times he who crossed
the seas without shipwreck was very
fortunate. Among these passengers
were Godwin and Wulf, traveling, as
their uncle had bidden them, unattend
ed by squires or by servants. Upon the
ship they passed themselves off as
brothers named Peter and John of Lin
coln, a town of which they knew some
thing, having stayed there on their way
to the Scottish wars, simple gentlemen
of small estate, making a pilgrimage to
the Holy Land In penitence for their
sins and for the repose of the souls of
their father and mother. At this tale
their fellow passengers, with whom
they had sailed from Genoa, to which
place they traveled overland, shrugged
their shoulders. For these brethren
looked what they were, knights of high
degree; and considering their great
stature, long swords and the coats of
mail they always wore beneath their
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
gambesons, none believed them but
simple gentlefolk bent on a. pious er
rand. Indeed, they nicknamed them
Sir Peter and Sir John, and as such
they were known throughout the voy
age.
The brethren were seated together in
a little place; apart in the bow of the
ship, and engaged, Godwin in reading
from an Arabic translation of the Gos
pels made by some Egyptian monk, and
Wulf in following it with little ease in
the Latin version. Of the former
tongue, indeed, they had acquired much
in their youth, since they learned it
from Sir Andrew with Rosamund, al
though they could not talk it as she
did, had been taught to lisp it as an in
fant by her mother. Knowing that
much might hang upon a knowledge of
this to-ngue, they occupied their long
journey in studying it from such books
as they couid yet; also in speaking it
with a priest, who had I spent many
years In the East, and instructed them
for a fee, and with certain Syrian mer
chants and sailors.
"Shut the book, brother," said
Wuii; "there is Lebanon at last," and
he pointed to the great line of moun
tains .revealing themselves dimly
through their wrappings of mist.
"Glad I am to see tnem, who have
had enough of these crooked scrolls
and learnings."
"Aye," said Godwin; "the Promised
Land."
"And the Land of Promise for us,"
answered his brother. "Well, thank
God that the time has come to act,
though how we are to set about it is
more than I can .say."
"Doubtless time will show. As our
uncle bade, we will seek out this
Sheik Jebalâ"
"Hush!" said Wulf, for just then
some merchants, and with them a
number of pilgrims, their travel-worn
faces full of rapture at the thought
that the terrors of the voyage were
done and they were about to set foot
upon the ground their Lord had trod
den, crowded "forward to the bow to
obtain their first view of it and there
burst into prayers and songs of
thanksgiving. Indeed, one of these
menâa trader known as Thomas of
Ipswichâwas, they found, standing
close to them and seemed as though
he listened to their talk.
The brethren mingled with them
while this same Thomas of Ipswich,
who had visited the place before, or
so it seemed, pointed out the beauties
of the city, of the fertile country by
which it was surrounded and of the
distant cedar-clad mountains where,
as he said, Hiram, King of Tyre, had
cut the timber for Solomon's Temple.
"Have you been on them?" asked
Wulf.
"Aye, following my business," he
answered, "so far." And he showed
them a grejit snow-capped peak to
the north. "Few ever go farther."
"Why not?" asked Godwin.
"Because there begins the territory
of the Sheik Al-Jebal"âand he looked
at them meaninglyâ"whom," he add
ed, "neither Christian nor Saracen
visits without an invitation, which is
seldom given."
They inquired why not.
"Because," answered the trader,
Sill watching them, "most men love
leir lives, and that man*is the lord
of death and magic. Strange things
are to be seen in his casttle and about
its wonderful gardens, inhabited by
lovely women that are evil spirits, who
bring the souls of men to ruin. Also,
this old man of the mountain is a
great murderer, of whom even all the
princes of the East are terrified, for
he speaks a word to his fedais âor
servants âwho are initiated, and they
go forth and bring to, death any w-hom
he hates. Young men, I like you well,
and I say to you, be warned. In this
Syria there are many wonders to be
seen; leave those of Masyaf and its
fearful lord alone if you desire to look
again upon the towns of Lincoln."
"Fear not; we will," answered God
win, "who come to seek holy placesâ
not haunts of devils."
"Of course, we will," added Wulf.
"Still, that country must be worth
traveling In." Â»
Then boats came out to greet them
from the shoreâfor at that time Bei
rut was in the hands of the Franksâ
and in the shouting and confusion
which followed they saw no more of
this merchant, Thomas. Nor did they
seek him out again, since they thought
it unwise to show themselves too curi
ous about the Sheik Al-Jebal. Indeed,
it would have been useless, since he
was ashore two full hours before they
were suffered to leave the ship, from
which he departed alone in a private
boat.
At length they stood in the motley
Eastern crowd upon the quay, wonder
ing where they could find an inn that
was quiet and of cheap charges, since
they did not wish to be considered per
sons of wealth or importance. As they
lingered here, somewhat bewildered, a
tall, veiled woman whom they had
noted watching them drew near, ac
companied by a porter, who led a don
key. This man, without more ado,
seized their baggage, and helped by
other porters began to fasten It upon
the back of the donkey with great ra
pidity, and when they would have
forbidden him, pointed to the veiled wo
man.
"Your pardon," said Godwin to her
at length and speaking in French,
"but this manâ"
"Loads up your baggage to take it to
my inn. It is cheap, quiet and com
fortableâthings which I heard you say
you required just now, did I not?" she
answered in a sweet voice, also speak
ing in good French.
Godwin looked at Wulf, and Wulf at
Godwin, and they began to discuss to
gether what they should do. When
they had agreed that it seemed not
wise to trust themselves to the care of
a strange woman in this fashion, they
looked up to see the donkey laden with
their trunks being led away by the
porter.
"Too late to say nay, I fear me," said
the woman with a laugh, "so you must
be my guests awhilfe if you would not
lose your baggage. Come, after so long
a journey you need to wash and eat.
Follow me, sirs, I pray you."
Then she walked through the crowd,
which, they noted, parted for her as
she went, to a post where a fine mule
was tied. - Loosing it, she leaped to the
saddle without help and began to ride
away, looking back from time to time
to see that they were following her, as,
indeed, they must.
"Whither go we, I wonder," said
Godwin, as they trudged through the
sands of Beirut, with the hot sun strik
ing on their heads.
"Who can answer that question when
a strange woman leads?" replied Wulf
with a laugh.
At iast the woman on the mule turn
ed through a doorway in a wall of un
burnt brick and they found themselves
before the porch of a white, rambling
house which stood in a large garden
planted with mulberries, oranges, and
other fruit trees that were strange to
them and was situated on the borders
of the city.
Here the woman dismounted and
gave the mule to a Nubian who was
waiting. Then, with a quick move
ment, she unveiled herself and turned
toward them as though to show her
beauty. Beautiful she was, of that
there could be no doubt, with her
graceful, swaying shape, her dark and
liquid eyes, her rounded features and
strangely impassive countenance. She
was young also, perhaps twenty-five,
no more, and very fair-skinned for an
Eastern.
"My poor house is for pilgrims and
merchants,, not for famous knights;
yet, sirs, I welcome you to it," she said
presently, scanning them out of the
corners of her eyes.
"We are but squires in ouf own
country, who make the pilgrfmage,"
replied Godwin. "For what sum each
day will you give us board and a good
room to sleep in?"
"These strangers," she said in
Arabic to the porter, "do not speak
the truth."
"W hat is that to you?" he answered,
as he busied himself in loosening the
baggage. "They will pay their score,
and all sorts of mad folk come to this
country, pretending to be what they
are not. Also you sought themâwhy,
I know not ânot they you."
"Mad or sane, they are proper men,"
said the impassive woman, aa though
to herself, then added in French,
"Sirs, I repeat, this is but a humble
place, scarce fit for knights like you,
but if you will honor it, the charge
isâso much."
"We are satisfied," said Godwin,
"especially," he added, with a bow and
removing the cap from his head, "as,
having brought us here without leave
asked, we are sure that you will treat
us who are strangers kindly."
"As kindly as you will âI mean as
you can pay for," said the woman.
"Nay, I will settle with the porter; he
would cheat you."
Then followed a wrangle five min
utes long between this curious, hand
some, still-faced woman and the por
ter, Who after the Eastern fashion
lashed himself Into a frenzy over the
sum she offered and at length began
to call her by ill names.
She stood looking at him quite un
moved, although Godwin, who under
stood all, but pretended to under
stand nothing, wondered at her pa
tience. Presently, however, in a per
fect foam of passion he said, or
rather spat out:
"Nb wonder, Masouda the Spy,
that after hiring me to do your evil
work you take the part of these
Christian dogs against a true believer,
you child of Al-Jebal!"
instantly the woman seemed to
stiffen like a snake about to strike.
â¢ Who is he." she said coldly. "Do
you mean the lordâwho kills?" And
she looked at himâa terrible look.
At that glance all the anger seemed
to go out of the man.
"Your pardon, Widow Masouda,"
In* said, "I forgot that you are a
Christian, and naturally side with
Christians. The money will not pay
me for the wear of my ass's hoofs,
but give it me, and let me go to pil
grims who will reward me better."
She gave him the sum, adding in
her (tuiat voice:
"Go; and if you love life keep bet
ter watch over your words."
Then he went, and now so humble
was his mien that in his dirty turban
and long, tattered robe he looked,
"Wulf thought, more like a bundle of
rags than a man mounted on the don
key's back. Also it came into his
mind that their strange hostess had
powers not possessed by innkeepers
in England. When she had watched
him through the gate Masouda
turned to them and said in French:
"Forgive me, but here in Beirut these
Saracen porters are extortionate, es
pecially toward us Christians. HÂ§ was
deceived by your appearance. He*
thought that you were knights, not
simple pilgrims as you avow yourselves,
who happen to be dressed and armed
like knights beneath your gambesons;
and," she added, fixing her eyes upon
the line of white hair on Godwin's head
where the sword had struck him in the
fray on Death Creek Quay, "show the
wounds of knights, though it is true
that man might come by such In any
brawl in a tavern. Well, you are to
pay me a good price, and you shall
have ray best room while it pleases you
to honor me with your company. Ah!
your baggage. You do not wish to
leave it. Slave, come here."
With startling suddenness the Nu
bian who had led away the mule ap
peared, and took up some of the pack
ages. Then she led them down a pas
sage into a large, sparsely furnished
room with high windows, in which were
two beds laid on the cement floor, and
asked .them If it pleased them. They
said: "Yes; it will serve." Reading
what passed in their minds, she added:
"Have no fear for your baggage. Were
you as rich as you say you are poor,
and as noble as you say you are
humble, both it and you are safe in
the inn of the Widow Masouda, O my
guestsâbut how are you named?"
"Peter and John."
"O my guests, Peter and John, who
have come to visit the land of Peter
and John and other holy founders of
our faith."
"And hate been so fortunate as to be
captured on its shore by the Widow
Masouda," answered Godwin, bowing
again.
"Wait to speak of the fortune until
you have done with her, sirâis it Peter,
or John?" she replied, with something
like a smile upon her handsome face.
"Peter," answered Godwin. "Re
member the pilgrim with the line of
white hair is Peter."
"You need it to distinguish you apart,
who, I suppose, are twins. Let me see
âPeter has a line of white hair and
gray eyes. John has blue eyes. John
also is the greater warrior, if a pilgrim
can be a warriorâlook at his muscles;
but Peter thinks the more. It would
be hard for a woman to choose between
Peter and John, who must both of
them be hungry, so I go to prepare
their food."
"A strange hostess," said Wulf,
laughing, when she had left the room;
"but I like her, though she netted as
so finely. I wonder why? What is
more. Brother Godwin, she likes you,
which is as well, since she may be use
ful. But, Friend Peter, do not let it
go too far, since I think also that she
may be dangerous, as that porter
thought. Remember, he called her a
spy, and like enough she is one."
Godwin turned to reprove him, when
the voice of the Widow Masouda was
heard without saying:
"Brothers Peter and John, I forgot to
caution you to speak low In this house,
as there is lattice work over the doors
to let in the air. Do not be afraid. I
only heard the voice of John, not what
he said." . .
"I hope not," muttered Wulf, and this
time he spoke very low indeed.
Then they undid their baggage, and
having taken from it clean garments,
washed themselves after their long
journey with the water that had been
placed ready for them in great jars.
This, indeed, they needed, for on that
crowded dromon there was little chance
of washing. By the time they had
clothed themselves afresh, putting on
their shirts of mail beneath their tun
ics, the Nubian came and led them to
another room, large and lighted with
high-set lattices, where cushions were
piled upon the floor round a rug that
also was laid upon the floor. Motioning
them to be seated on the cushions, he
went away, to return again presently,
accompanied by Masouda bearing
dishes upon brass platters. These she
piaced before them, bidding them eat.
What that food was they did not know,
because of the sauces with which it had
covered, until she told them that
it was fish. After the fish came flesh,
and after the flesh fowls, and after the
fowls cakes and sweetmeats and fruits,
until, ravenous as they were, who for
days had fed upon salted pork and
biscuits full of worms washed down
with bad water, they were forced to
beg her to bring no more.
"Drink another cup of wine at least,"
she said, smiling and filling their mugs
with the sweet vintage of Lebanon
tor it seemed to please her to see them
eat so heartily of her fare.
They obeyed, mixing the wine with
water. While they drank she asked
them suddenly what were their plans,
and how long they wished to stay in
Beirut. They answered that for the
next few days,they had none, as they
needed to rest, to see the town and its
neighborhood, and to buy good horses â
a matter in which perhaps she could
help them, Masouda nodded again, and
asked whither they wished to ride on
horses.
"Out yonder," said Wulf, waving his
hands toward the mountains. "We de
sire to look upon the cedars of Lebanon
and its great hills before we go on to
ward Jerusalem."
"Cedars of Lebanon?" she replied.
"That is scarcely safe for two men
alone, for in those mountains are many
wild beasts and- wild people who rob
and kill. Moreover, the lord of those
mountains has just now a quarrel with
the Christians, and Would take any
whom he found prisoners."
"How is that lord named?" asked
Godwin.
"Sinan," she answered, and they not
ed that she looked round quickly as
she spoke the word.
"Oh," he said, "we thought the name
was Jebal."
Now she stared at him with wide,
wondering eyes, and replied:
"He is so called also; but, Sir Pil
grims, what know you of the dread
lord Al-Jebal?"
"Only that he lives at a place called
Masyaf, which we wish to visit."
Again she stared.
"Are you mad?" she queried, then
checked herself, and clapped her hands
for the slave to remove the dishes.
While this was being done they said
they would like to walk abroad.
"Good," answered Masouda; "the
man shall accompany youânay, it is
best that you do not go alone, as you
might lose your way. Also, the place
is not always safe for strangers, how
ever humble they may seem," she
added with meaning. "Would you wish
to visit the Governor at the castle,
where there are a few English knights,
also some priests who give advice to
pilgrims?" â¢
"We think not," answered Godwin;
"we are not worthy of such high com
pany. But, lady, why do you look at
us so strangely?"
"I am wondering, Sir Peter and Sir
John, why you think it worth while
to tell lies to a poor widow? Say, in
your own country did you ever hear
of certain twin brethren namedâoh,
how r are they named? âSir Godwin and
Sir Wulf of the house of D'Arcy, which
has been told of in this land?"
New Godwin's jaw dropped, but Wulf
laughed out loud, and seeing that they
were alone in the room, for the slave
had departed, asked in his turn:
"Surely those twins would be pleased
to find themselves so famous. But how
did you chance to hear of them, O
widowed hostess of a Syrian inn?"
"I? Oh, from a man on the dromo
who called here while I made ready
your food, and told me a strange story
that he had learned in England of a
band sent by Â§alah-ed-din âmay his
name be accursed! âto capture a cer
tain lady. Of how the brethren named
Godwin and Wulf fought all that band
also âaye, and held them offâa very
knightly deed he said it wasâwhile the
lady escaped; and of how afterward
they were taken in a snare, as those
are apt to be who deal with the Sultan,
and this time the lady was snatched
away."
"A wild tale truly." said Godwin.
"But did this man tell you further
whether.that lady chanced to come to
Palestine?"
She shook her head.
"Of that he told, me nothing, and I
have heard nothing. Now listen, my
guests. You think It strange that I
should know so much, but it is not
strange, since here In Syria, knowledge
is the business of some of us. Did
you then believe, oh foolish children,
that two knights like you, who have
played a part In a very great story,
whereof already whlspe* run through
out the East, could travel by land and
sea and not be known. Did you then
think that none were left behind to
watch your movements and make re
port of them to that mighty one who
sent out the ship of war, charged with
a certain mission? Well, what he
knows I know. Have I not said it is
my business to know? Now why do I
tell you this? Well, perhaps because I
like such knights as you are, and I
like that tale of two men who stood
side by side upon a pier, while a wom
an swam the stream behind them, and
afterward, sore wounded, charged their
way through a host pf foes. In the
East we love such deeds of chivalry.
Perhaps also I would warn you not to
throw away lives so gallant by at
tempting to win through the guarded
gates of Damascus upon the maddest
of all quests."
"What, you still stare at me and
doubt? Good, I have been telling you
lies. I was not awaiting you upon the
quay, and that porter with whom I
seemed to quarrel was not charged to
seize your baggage and bring it to my
house. No spies watched your move
ments from England to Beirut. Only
since you have been at dinner I visited
your room and read some writings
which, foolishly, you have.left among
your baggage, and opened some books
In which other names than Peter and
John were written, and drew a great
sword from its scabbard on which was
engraved a motto: 'Meet D'Arcy, meet
Death!' and heard Peter call John
Wulf, and John call Peter Godwin, and
so forth." *
'.'lt seems," said Wulf in English,
"that we are flies in a web, and that
the spider is called the Widow Ma
souda, though of what use we are to
her I know not. Now, brother, what
is to be done? Make friends with the
spider?"
"An ill ally," answered Godwin. Then
looking her straight in the face he
asked: "Hostess, who knows so much,
tell me, why, among other names,
did the donkey driver call you "Child
of Al-Jebal'?"
She started, and answered:
"So you understand Arabic? 1
thought it. Why do you ask? Whit
does it matter to you?"
"Not much except, as we are going to
visit Al-Jebal, of course we think our
selves fortunate to have met his daugh
ter."
"Going to visit Al-Jebal? Yes, you
hinted as much upon the ship, did you
not? Perhaps that is why 1 came to
meet you. Well, your throats will be
cut before ever you reach the first of
his castles."
"I think not," said Godwin, and, put
ting his hand into his breast, he drew
thence a ring, with which he began to
piay carelessly.
"Whence did you get that ring?" she
said with fear and Yonder in her eyes.
"It is " and she ceased.
"Prom one to whom it was given and
who has charged us with a message.
Now, hostess, let us be plain with one
another. You know a great deal about
us, but although it has suited us to
call ourselves the pilgrims Peter and
John, in all this there is nothing of
which we need be ashamed, especially
as you say that our secret is no se
cret, which I can well believe. Now,
this secret being out, I propose that we
remove ourselves from your roof, and
go to stay with our own people at
the castle, where I doubt not we shall
be welcome, telling them that we would
bide no longer with one who is called a
spy, whom we have discovered also to
be a 'daughter of Al-Jebal.' After
which, perhaps, you will bide no longer
in Beirut, where, as we gather, spies
and the 'daughters of Al-Jebal' are not
welcome."
She listened with an impassive face,
and answered:
"Doubtless you will have heard that
one of us who was so named was
burned here recently as a witch?"
"Yes," broke in Wulf, who now
learned this fact for the first time; "we
heard that."
"And think to bring a like fate upon
me. Why, foolish man, I can lay you
both dead before ever those words pats
your lips."
"You think you can," said Godwin;
"but for my part I am sure that this
is not fated, and am sure also that you
do not wish to harm us any more than
we wish to harm you. To be plain,
then, it is necessary for us to visa
Al-Jebal. As chance has brought us
togetherâif it be chanceâwill you aid
us in this, as I think you can, or must
we seek other help?"
"I do not know. I will tell you after
four days. If you are not satisfied
with that, go, denounce me, do your
worst, and I will do mine, for which
1 should be sorry."
"Where is the security that you will
not do it if we are satisfied?" asked
Wulf bluntly.
"You must take the word of a
'daughter of Al-Jebal.' I have none
other to offer," she replied.
"That may mean death," said Wulf.
"You said just now that was not
fated, and although I have sought your
company for my own reasons, I have
no quarrel with youâas yet. Choose
your own path. Still, I tell you that if
you go, who, chancing to know Arabic,
have learned my secret, you die, and
that if you stay you are safe âat least
while you are in this house. I swear it
bn the token of Al-Jebal," and bending
.forward she touched the ring in God
win's hand; "but remember that for
the future I cannot answer."
Godwin and Wulf looked at each
other. Then Godwin replied:
"I think that we will trust you, and
stay," words at which she smiled a lit
tle as though she were pleased, then
said:
"Now, if you wish to walk abroad,
guests Peter and John, I will summon
the slave to guide you, and in four
days we will talk more of this matter
of your journey, which, until then, had
best be forgotten."
So the man came, armed with a
sword, and led them out, clad in their
pilgrims' robes, through the streets of
this eastern town, and where every
thing was so strange that for a while
they forgot their troubles in studying
the new life about them. They noted,
moreover, that though they went into
quarters where no Franks were to be
seen, and where fierce-looking servants
of the prophet stared at them sourly,
the presence of this slave of Masouda
seemed sufficient to protect them from
affront, since on seeing him even the
turbaned Saracens nudged each other
and turned aside. In due course they
came to the inn again, having met no
one whom they knew, except two pil
grims who had been their fellow-pas
sengers on the dromon. These men
were astonished when they said they
had been through the Saracen quarter
of the city, where, although this town
was in the hands of the Christians, it
was scarcely thought safe for Franks
to venture without a strong guard.
When the brethren were back in their
chamber, seated in the far corner of it,
and speaking very low, lest they should
be overheard, they consulted together
long and earnestly as to what they
should do. This was clearâthey .and
something of their mission were known,
and doubtless notice of their coming
would soon be given to the Sultan Sa
ladin. From the King and great lords
in Jerusalem they could expect little
help, since to give it might be to bring
about an open rupture with Saladin,
such as the Franks dreaded, and for
which they were ill-prepared. Indeed,
if they went to them, it seemed likely
that they would be prevented from
stirring in this dangerous starch for a
woman who was the niece of Saladin,
and for aught they knew thrown into
prison, or shipped back to Europe.
True, they might try to And their way
to Damascus alone, but if the Sultan
was warned of their coming, would he
not cause them to be killed upon the
road, or cast into some dungeon where
they would languish out their .lives?
The more they spoke of these matters
the more they were perplexed, till at
length Godwin said:
"Brother, our uncle bade us earnestly
to seek out this Al-Jebal, and though
it seems that to do so is very danger
ous, I think that we had best obey him
who may have been given foresight at
the last. When all paths are full of
thorns what matter which you tread?"
"A good saying," answered Wulf. "I
am weary of doubts and troublings.
Let us follow our uncle's rede, and visitthis Old Mnn of the Mountains, to do
which 1 think the Widow Masouda is
the woman to help us. If we die on
that journey, well, at least we shall
have done our best."
CHAPTER IX.
The Horses Flame and Smoke.
On the following morning when they
came into the eating-room of the inn
Godwin and Wulf found they were no
longer alone in the house, for sundry
other guests sat there partaking of
their morning meal. Among them were
a grave merchant from Damascus, an
other from Alexandria in Egypt, a man
who seemed to be an Arab chief, a Jew
of Jerusalem, and none other than the
English trader Thomas of Ipswich,
their fellow passenger, who greeted
them warmly. Truly they were a
strange and motley set of men. Con
sidering them as the young and stately
Widow Aiasouda moved from one to the
other, talking to each in turn while she
attended to their wants, it came into
Godwin's mind that they might be spies
meeting there to gain or exchange in
formation,- or even to make report to
their hostess, in whose pay perhaps
they were. Still if so, of this they
showed no sign, speaking for the most
part in French, which all of them un
derstood, on general matters, such as
the heat of the weather, the price of
transport animals or merchandise, and
the, cities w hither they purposed to
travel.
The trader Thomas, it seemed, had
intended to start for Jerusalem that
morning with his goods. But the rid
ing mule he had' bought proved to be
lame from a_prick in the hoof, nor were
all his hired camels come down from
the mountains, so that he must wait a
few days or so, he said. Under these
circumstances he offered the brethren
his company in their ramblings about
the town. This they thought it wise
not to refuse, although they felt little
confidence in the man, believing that it
was he who had found out their story
and true names and revealed them to
Masouda, either through talkativeness
or with a purpose.
However these things might be, this
Thomas proved of service to them,
since, although he was but just landed,
he seemed to know all that had passed
in Syria since he left it and all that
was passing then. Thus he told them
how Guy of Lusignan had just made
himself King of Jerusalem on the death
of tne child Baldwin, and how Ray
mond of Tripoli refused to acknowledge
him and was about to be besieged in
Tiberias. How Saladin also was gath
ering a great host at Damascus to
make war upon the Christians, and
many other things, false and true.
In his company, then, and sometimes
in that of the other guestsânone of
whom showed any curiosity concerning
them, though whether this was from
good manners or from other reasons
they could not be sureâthe brethren
passed the hours profitably enough.
It was on the third morning of their
stay that their hostess, Masouda, with
whom as yet they had no further pri
vate talk, asked them that if they had
not said that they wished to buy horses.
On their answering "Yes," she added
that she had told a certain man to
bring two for them to look at, which
were now in the stable beyond the
garden. Thither they went, accom
panied by Masouda, to find a grave
Arab, wrapped in a garment of camel's
hair and â¢ a spear in his hand,
standing at the uoor of the cave which,
as is common i - the East where the
heat is so great, served the purpose of
a Hiable. As they advanced toward him
Masouda said:
"If you like the horses, leave me to
bargain, and seem to understand noth
ing of my talk."
The Arab, who took no notice of them,
saluted Masouda and said to her in
Arabic:
"Is it then for Franks that I have
been ordered to bring the two priceless
ones?"
"What is that to you, my uncle, Son
of the Sand?" she asked. "Let them
be led forth that I may know whether
they are those for which I sent."
The man turned and called through
the door of the cave.
"Flame, come hither!" As he spoke,
there was a sound of hoofs, and through
the low archway leapt the most beau
tiful horse that ever their eyes had
seen. It was gray in color, with flow
ing mane and tail, and on its forehead
was a black star; nor over tall, but
with a barrel-like shape of great
strength, small-headed, large-eyed,
wide-nostriled large-boned, but fine be
neath the knee, and round-hoofed. Out
it sprang, snorting; then seeing its
master, the Arab, checked itself and
stood still by him as though it had
been turned to stone.
"Come hither, Smoke," called the
Arfab again, and another horse ap
peared and ranged itself by the first.
In size and shape it was the same, but
the color was coal-black and Jhe star
upon its forehead white. Also the eye
was more fiery.
"These are the horses," said the
Arab, Masouda translating. "They are
twins, 7 years old and never backed un
til they were 6, cast at a birth by the
swiftest mare in Syria, and of a pedi
gree that can be counted for a hundred
' years."
"Horses indeed!" said Wulf. "Horses
Indeed! But what is the price of
them?"
Masouda repeated the question In
Arabic, whereon the man replied in
the same tongue with a slight shrug
of the shoulders.
"Be not foolish. You know this is
no question of price, for tney are be
| ycnd price. Say what you will."
| "He says," said Masouda, "that it is
' a hundred gold pieces for the pair.
Can you pay as much?"
The brethren" looked at each other.
The sum was large.
"Such horses have saved men's lives
ere now," added Masouda, "and I do
not think that I can ask him to take
less, seeing that did he but know It, in
Jerusalem they could be sold for thrice
as much. But if you wish, I could lend
you money, since doubtless you have
Jewels or other articles of value you
could give as securityâthat ring in
your breast, for Instance, Peter."
"We have the gold itself," answered
Wulf, who would have paid to his last
piece for those horses
"They buy," said Masouda.
"They buy, but can they ride?"
- asked the Arab. "These horses are not
for children or pilgrims. Unless they
can ride well they shall not have them
âno, not even if you ask it of me."
Godwin said that he thought soâat
least, they would try- Then the Arab,
leaving the horses standing there, went
into the stable, and with the help of
two of the Inn servants brought out
bridles and saddles unlike any they
had seen. They were but thickly-quilt
ed pads stretching far back upon the
horses' loins, with strong hide girths
strapped with wool and chased stirrups
fashioned like half hoofs. The bits also
were only snaffles without curbs.
When all was ready and the stirrups
had been let down to the length they
desired, the Arab motioned to them to
mount. As they prepared to do so,
however, he spoke some word, an* sud
denly those meek, quiet horses were
turned into two devils, which reared
up on their hind legs and threatened
them with their teeth and witht their
front hoofs, that were shod with thin
plates of iron. Godwin stood wonder
ing, but Wulf, who was angry at the
trick, got behind the horses, and,watch
ing his chance, put his hands upon the
flanks of the stallion named Smoke,
and with one spring leapt into the sad
dle. Masouda smiled, and even the
Arab muttered "Good," while Smoke,
feeling himself backed, came to the
ground again and became quiet as a
sheep. Then the Arab spoke to the
horse Flame, and Godwin was allowed
to vault into the saddle also.
"Where shall we go?" he asked.
Masouda said that they would show
them, and, accompanied by her and the
Arab, they walked the horses until they
were quiet clear of the town, to And
themselves on a road that had Jhe sea
to the left, and to the right a stretch of
tiat land, some of it cultivated, above
which rose the steep and stony sides of
hills. Here on this road they trotted
and cantered the horses to and fro, tiil
they began to be at home in their
strange saddles, who from child
hood had ridden barebacked in the
Essex marches, and to learn what
pressure on the bit was needed
to check or turn them. When
they came back to where the pair
stood, Masouda said that if they were
not afraid the seller wished to show
them that the horses were both strong
"We fear no ride that he dares to
take himself," answered Wulf angrily,
whereupon the Arab smiled grimly
and said something in a low voice to
Masouda. Then, placing his hand
upon Smoke's flank, he leaped up be
hind Wulf, .the horse never stirring.
"Say, Peter, are you minded to take
a companion for this ride?" asked
Masouda, and as she spoke a strange
look came into her eyes, a wild look
that was new to the brethren.
"Surely," answered Godwin, "but
where is the companion?"
Her reply was to do as the Arab
had done, and seating herself straddle
legged behind Godwin to clasp him
around the middle.
"Truly you look a pretty pilgrim
now, brother," said Wulf, laughing
aloud, while even the grave Arab
smiled and Godwin muttered between
his teeth the old proverb. "Woman on
croup, devil on bow." But aloud he
said, "I am indeed honored; yet,
friend Masouda, if harm should come
of this, do not blame me."
"No harm will come âto you, friend
Peter, and I had been so long cooped
in an inn that L who am desert born,
wish for a gallop on the mountains
with a good horse beneath me and a
brave knight in front, listen, you
brethren; you say you do not fear;
then leave your bridles loose and
where'er we go and whate'er we meet
seek not to check *or turn the horses
Flame and Smoke. Now, Son of the
Sand, we will test these nags of which
you sing so loud a song. Away, and
let the ride be fast and far!"
"On your head be it then, daughter,"
answered the old Arab. "Pray Allah
that these Franks can sit a horse!"
Then his somber eyes seemed to take
fire, and gripping the encircling saddle
girth, he uttered some words of com
mand, at which the stallions threw up
their beads and began to move at a
long, swinging gallop toward the
mountains a mile away. At first they
went over cultivated land off which the
crops had already been cut, striking
two or three ditches and a low wall in
their stride so smoothly that the breth
ren felt as though they were seated
upon swallows. Then came a space of
sandy i3ward, half a mile or more,
where their pace quickened, after which
they began to breast the long slope of
a hill, picking *their way among the
stones like cats. Ever steeper It grew
till in places it was go sheer that God
win must clutch the mane of Flame
and Masouda must cling close to God
win's middle to save themselves from
slipping off behind. Yet, notwithstand
ing the double weights they bore, those
gallant steeds never seemed to falter
or to tire. At one spot they plunged
through a mountain stream. Godwin
noted that not fifty yards to their
right this stream fell over a little prec
ipice .cutting its way between cliffs
which were full eighteen feet from
bank to bank, and thought to himself
that had they struck it lower down that
ride must have ended. Beyond the
stream lay a hundred yards or so of
level ground, and above It still steeper
country, up which they pushed their
way through bushes, till at length they
came to the top of the mountain and
saw the plain they had left lying two
miles or more below them.
"These horses climb hills like goats,"
Wulf said; "but one thing is certain,
we must lead them down."
Now on the top of the mountain was
a stretch of land almost flat and stone
less, over which they cantered forward,
gathering: speed as the horses recovered
their wind till the pace grew fast. Sud
denly the stallions threw themselves on
to their haunches and stopped, as well
they might, for they were on the verge
of a chasm, at whose far foot a river
brawled in white foam. For a moment
they stood; then, at some word from
the Arab, wheeled round, and, bearing
to the left, began to gallop back across
the tableland, until they aproached
the edge of the mountain side, where
the brethren thought they would stop.
But Masouda cried to the Arab, and
the Arab cried to the horses, and Wulf
cried to Godwin In the English tongue:
"Show no fear, brother. Where they
go. we can go."
"Pray God that the girths may hold,"
answered Godwin, leaning back against
the breast of Masouda behind him. As
ho spoke they began to descend the hill,
slowly at first, afterward faster v and
yet more fast, till they rushed down
ward like a whirlwind.
How did those horses keep their foot
ing? They never knew, and certainly
none that were bred in England could
have done so. Yet never falling, never
stumbling even, on they sped, taking
great rocks in their stride, till at length
they reached the level piece of land
above the stream, or rather above the
cleft fully eighteen feet In width, at the
foot of which that stream ran. God
win saw and turned cold. Were these
folk mad that they would put double
laden horses at such a Jump?. If they
hung back, If they missed their stride,
if they caught hoof or sprang short,
swift death was their portion.
But the old Arab seated behind Wulf
only shouted aloud, and Masouda only
tightened her round arms about God
win's middle and laughed In his ear.
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
The horses heard the shout, and seem
ing to see what was before them,
stretched out their long necks and
rushed forward over the flat ground.
Now they were on the edge of the ter
rible place, and, like a man in a dream,
Godwin noted the sharp, sheer lips of
the cliff, the gulf between them and
the white foam of the stream a score
of yardÃ beneath. Then he felt the
brave horse Flame gather itself to
gether and next instant fly into the air
like a bird. Also âand was this dream
indeed, for even as they sped over that
horrible pit did he feel a woman's lips
pressed upon his cheek? He was not
sure. Who could have been at such a
time, with death beneath them? Per
chance it was the wind that kissed him,
or a lock of her loose hair that struck
across his face. Indeed, aÂ£ the moment
he thought of other things than wom
en's lipsâthose of the black and yawn
ing gulf, for instance. v
They swooped through the air, the
white foam vanished; they were safe.
No; the h'nd feet of Flame had missed
their footing, they fell, they were lost.
A struggle. How tight those arms
clung about his own. How close that
face was pressed against his own. Lo!
it was over. They were speeding down
the hill, and alongside of the gray
horse Flame raced the black horse
Smoke, Wulf on its back, with eyes
that seemed to be starting from his
head, shouting, "A d'Arcy! A d'Arcy!"
and behind him, turban gone, and
white burnous floating like a pennon on
the air, the grim-visaged Arab, who
also snouted. Swifter and yet swifter.
Did ever horses gallop so fast?
Swifter and yet swifter, till the
air sang past them and the ground
seemed to- fly away beneath. The
slope was done. They w T ere on
the flat; the flat was passed, they were
in the fields; the fields were left be
hind; and, behold! side by side, with
hanging heads and panting flanks, the
horses Smoke and Flame stood still
upon the road, their sweating hides
dyed red in the light of the sinking
sun.
The grip loosened from about God
win's middle. It had been close; on
Masouda's round and naked arms were
the prints of the steel shirt beneath
his tunfc, for she slipped to the ground
and stood looking at them. Then she
smiled one of her slow, thrilling smiles,
gasped and said:
"You ride well, pilgrim Peter, and
pilgrim John rides well also, and these
are good horses; and, oh! that ride was
worth the riding, even though death
had been its end. Son of the Sand,
my Uncle, what say you?"
"That I grow old for such gallops
two on one horse, with nothing to
win!"
"Nothing to win?" said Masouda, "I
am not so sure!" and she looked at
Godwin. "Well, you have sold your
horses to pilgrims who can ride, and
they have proved them; and I have had
a change from my cooking in the inn,
to which I must now get me back
again."
Wulf wiped the sweat from his brow,
shook his head, and muttered:
"I always heard the East was full
of madmen and devils; now I know that
it is true."
But Godwin said.nothing.
They led the horses back to the inn,
where the brethren groomed them down
under the direction of the Arab, that
the gallant beasts might get used to
them, which, after carrying them upon
that fearful ride, they did readily
enough. Then they fed them with
chopped barley; ear and straw to
gether, and gave them water to drink
that had stood in the sun all day to
warm, in which the Arab mixed flour
and some white wine.
Next morning at the dawn they rose
to see how Flame and Smoke fared
after that journey. Entering the stable,
they heard the sound of a man weeping,
and hidden in the shadow, saw by the
dim light of the morning that it was
the old Arab, who stood with his back
to them, an arm around the neck of
each horse, which he kissed from time
to time. Moreover, he talked aloud in
his own tongue to them, calling them
his children, and saying that rather
would he sell his wife and sister to the
Franks.
"But," he added, "she has spokenâ
why, I know notâand I must obey.
Well, at least they are gallant men and
worthy of such steeds. Half T hoped
that you and the three of us and my
niece Masouda, the woman with the
secret face and eyes that have looked
on fear, might perish yesterday in the
cleft of the (stream; but It was not
willed of Allah. So farewell, Flame,
and farewell, Smoke, children of the
desert, who are swifter than arrows,
for never more shall I ride you in bat
tle. Well, at least I have others of your
matchless blood."
Then Godwin touched Wulf on the
shoulder, and they crept away from the
stable without the Arab knowing that
they had been there, for it seemed
shameful to pry upon his grief. When
they reached their room again Godwin
asked Wulf:
"Why does this man sell us those
noble steeds?"
"Because his niece, Masouda, has bid
him to do so," he answ-red.
"And why has she bidden kirn?"
"Ah!" replied Wulf. "He called her
'the woman with the secret face and
eyes that have looked on fear,' didn't
he? Well, for reasons that have to do
with his family perhaps, or with her
secrets, or us, with whom she plays
some game of which we know neither
the beginning nor the end. But, Broth
er Godwin, you are wiser than L Why
do you ask me these riddles? For my
part I do not wish to trouble my head
about them. All I know is that the
game is a brave one and I mean to go
through with it, especially as I believe
that this playing will lead us to Rosa
mund."
"May it lead us nowhere worse," an
swered Godwin, with something like a
groan, for he remembered that dream
of his which he dreamed in midair be
tween the edges of black rock with the
white foam beneath. But to Wulf he
said nothing of this dream.
When the sun was fully up they pre
pared to go out again, taking with
them the gold to pay the Arab, but on
opening the door of their room they met
Masouda, apparently about to knock
upon It.
"Whither go you. friends Peter and
John, and so early?" she asked, looking
at them with a smtlejupon her beauti
ful face that was "so thrilling and
seemed to hide so much mystery. God
win thought to himself that it was like
another smile, that on the face of the
woman-headed stone sphinx which they
had seen set up In the market place of
Beirut. p
"To visit cur horses and pay your un
cle, the Arab, his money," answered
Wulf.
"Indeed! I thought I saw you do the
first an hour ago, and as for the sec
ond, It Is useless; Son of the Sand has
gone."
"Gone! With the horses?"
'Nay, he has left them behind."
"Did you pay him, then, lady?" asked
Godwin.
It was so easy to see that Masouda
was pleased at this courteous word, for
her voice, which in general seemed
somewhat hard, softened as she an
swered, for the first time giving him
his own title.
"Why do you call me 'lady,' Sir God
win d'Arcy, who am but an innkeeper,
for whom sometimes men find hard
names? Well, perhaps I was a lady
once before 1 became an innkeeper; but
now 1 amâthe widow Masouda as you
are the pilgrim Peter. Still I thank
you lor thisâbad guess of yours."
Then, stepping back a foot or two to
ward the door, which she had closed be
hind her, she made him a curtsey so
full of dignity and grace that any who
saw it must be sure that, wherever she
might dwell, she was not bred in inns.
Godwin returned the bow, doffing his
cap. Their eyes met and from hers
hfl learned that he had no treachery
to fear from this woman, whatever"
else he might have to fear. Indeed,
from that moment, however black and
doubtful seemed the road, he would
have trusted his life to her; for this
vas the message written thereâa mes
sage which she meant that he should
read. Yet at his heart he felt terribly
afraid. Wulf, who saw something of
ell this and guessed more, also was
afraid. He wondered what Rosamund
would have thought of it, if she had
seen that strange look in the eyes of
this woman who had been a lady and
was an innkeeper, of whom men
called Spy, and daughter of Satan, and
child of Al-je-bal. To his fancy that
look was like a flash of lightning upon
a dark night, which for a second il
lumines some magical, unguessed land
scape, after which comes the night
again, blacker than before.
Now the widow Masouda was saying
in her usual somewhat hard voice:
"No; I did not pay him. At the last
he would take no money, but, having
passed it, neither would he break his
word to knights who can ride so well
and boldly. So I made a bargain with
him on behalf of both of you, which
1 expect that you will keep, since my
good faith is pledged, and this Arab is
a chief and my kinsman. It is this,
that if you and these horses should
live, and the time comes when you have
no more need of them, you will cause
it to be cried in the market-place of
whatever town is nearest to you, by
the voice of the public .crier, that for
six days they stand to De returned to
him who lent them. Then if he comes
not they can be sold, which must not
be sold or given away to any one with
out this proclamation. Do you con
sent?"
"Aye," answered both of them, but
Wulf added: "Only we siiould like to
know why the Arab, Son-of-the-Sand,
who is your kinsman, trusts his glor
ious horses to us in this fashion."
"Your breakfast Is served, my
guests," answered Masouda in tones
that rang like the clash of metal, so
hard were they. Whereon Wulf shook
his head and followed her into the eat
ing-room, which was now empty again
as it had been on the afternoon of their
arrival.
Most of the day they spent with their
horses. In the evening, this time unac
companied by Masouda, they rode out
for a little way, though rather doubt
fully, since they were not sure that
their beasts, which seemed to be almost
human, would not take the bits between
thir teeth and rush with them back to
the desert whence they came. But al
though from time to time they looked
about them for their master the Arab,
whinnying as they looked, this they
did not do, or show vice of any kind;
indeed, two ladies' palfreys could not
have been more quiet. So the brethren
brought them home again, groomed,
fed and fondled them, while they
pricked their ears, sniffing them all
over, as though they knew that these
were their new lords and wished to
make friends of them.
The morrow was a Sunday, and, at
tended by Masouda's slave, without
whom she would not suffer them to
walk in the town, the brethren went to
mass in the big church which had once
been a mosque, wearing pilgrims' robes
over their mail.
"Do you not accompany us, who are
of the faith?" asked Wulf.
"Nay," answered Masouda, "I am In
no mood to make confession. This day
I count my beads at home."
So they went alone, and mingling
with a crowd of humble persons at the
back of the church, which was large
and dim, watched the knights and
priests of various nations struggling
for precedence of place beneath the
dome. Also they heard the Bishop of
the town preach a sermon from which
they learned much. He spoke at length
of the great coming war with Saladin,
whom he named Anti-Christ. More
over, he prayed them all to compose
their differences and prepare for that
awful struggle, lest in the end the
cross of their Master should be tram
pled under foot of the Saracen, his sol
diers slain, his fanes desecrated and
his people slaughtered or driven Into
the seaâwords of warning that were
received in heavy silence.
"Four full days have gone by. Let
us ask our hostess if she has any news
for us," said Wulf as they walked back
to the inn-
"Aye, we will ask her," answered
Godwin.
As it chanced, there was no need, for
when they entered their chamber they
found Masouda standing in the center
of It, apparently lost in thought.
"I have come to speak with you,"
she said, looking up. "Do you still
wish to visit the sheik Al-je-bal?"
They answered "Yes."
"Good. I have leave for you to go;
but I counsel you not to go, for it is
dangerous. Let us be open with one
another. I know your object. I knew
it an hour before you ever set foot
upon this shore, and that is why you
were brought to this house. You would
seek the help of the lord Sinan against
Salah-ed-din, from whom you hope to
rescue a certain great lady of his blood
who is your kinswoman and whom
both of you desire in marriage. You
see, I have learned that also. Well,
this land is full of spies, who travel
to and from Europe and make report
of all things to those who pay them
enough. For instance âI can say It, as
you will not see him againâthe trader
Thomas, with whom you stayed in this
house, is such a spy. To him your story
has been passed on by otner spies in
England, and he passed it on to me."
"Are then you a spy also, as the
porter called you?" asked Wulf out
right.
"T am what I am," she answered
coldly. "Perhaps I also have sworn
oaths and serve as you serve. Who
my master Is or why I do so Is naught
to you. But I like you well, and we
have ridden togetherâa wild ride.
Therefore I warn you, though perhaps
I should not say so much, that the lord
Al-Jebal is one who takes payment
for what he gives, and that this busi
ness may cost you your lives."
"You warned us against Saladin
also." said Godwin, "so what is left to
us if we may dare a visit to neither?"
She shrugged her shoulders. "To
take service under one of the great
Frankish lords and wait a chance that
will never come. Or, better still, to
sew some cockle shells into your hats,
go home as holy men who have made
the pilgrimage, marry the richest
wives that you can find, and forget
Al-Jebal and Salah-ed-din and in
lady about whom he has dreamed a
dream. Only then," she added in a
changed voice, "remember, you must
leave your horses Flame and Smoke be
hind you."
"We wish to ride those horses," said
Wulf lightly, and Godwin turned on
her with anger in his eyes.
"s"ou seem to know our story," he
said, "and the mission to which we are
sworn. What sort of knights do you
think us, then, that you dare to offer
us counsel that Is fitter for those spies
from whom you learn your tidings.'
You talk of our lives. Well, we hold
our lives in trust, and when they are
asked of us we will yield them up, hav
ing done all that we may do."
"Well spoken," answered Masouda.
"11l should I have thought of you had
you said otherwise. But why would
you go to Al-Jebal?"
"Because our uncle at his death bade
us so to do without fail, and having no
other counsel we will take that of his
spirit, let come what may."
"Well spoken again! Then to Al-
Jebal you shall go, and let come what
come mayâto all three of us!"
"To all three of us," said Wulf.
"What, then, is your part in the mat
ter?" *
"I do not know, but perhaps more
than you think. At least, I must be
your guide."
"Do you mean to betray us?" asked
Wulf, bluntly.
She drew herself up and looked him
in the eyes till he grew red, then said:
"Ask your brother if he thinks that I
mean to betray you. No; I mean to
save you, if I can, and it comes into
my mind that before all is done you
will need saving, 'who speak so roughly
to those who would befriend you. Nay,
answer not; it is not strange that you
should doubt. Pilgrims to the fearful
shrine of Al-Jebal, if it pleases you, we
will ride at nightfall. Do not trouble
about food and such matters. I will
make preparations, but we go alone and
secretly. Take only your arms and
what garments you may need; the rest
I will store, and for it give you my re
ceipt. Now Igo to make things ready.
See, I pray of you, that the horses
Flame and Smoke are saddled by sun
set."
At sundown, accordingly, the breth
ren stood waiting in their room. They
were fully armed beneath their rough
pilgrims' robes, even to the bucklers
which had been hidden in their bag
gage. Also the saddlebags of carpet
which Masouda had given them were
packed with such things as they must
take, the rest having been handed over
to her keeping.
Presently the door opened and a
young man stood before them clothed in
the rough camel-hair garment, or bur
nous, which is common in the East.
"What do you want?" asked Godwin.
"I want you, brothers Peter and
John," was the reply, and they saw
that the slim young man was Masou
da. "What! you English Innocents, do
you not know a woman through a
camel-hair cloak?" she added as she
led the wav to the stable. "Well, so
much the better, for it shows that my
disguise is good. Henceforth be pleased
to forget the widow Masouda and, un
til we reach the land of Al-Jebal, to
remember that I am your servant, a
halfbreed from Jaffa named David, of
no religionâor of all,"
In the stable the horses stood sad
dled, and near to them anotherâa good
Arabâand two laden Cyprian mules,
but no attendant was to be seen. They
brought them out and mounted, Ma
souda riding like a man and leading
the mules, of which the head of one
was tied to the tail of the other. Five
minutes later they were clear of Bei
rut, and through the solemn twilight
hush, followed the road whereon they
had tried the horses, toward the Dog
River, three leagues away, which Ma
souda said they would reach by moon
rise. Soon it grew very dark, and she
rode alongside of them to'show them
the path, but they did not talk much.
Wulf asked her who would take care
of the inn while she was absent, to
which she answered sharply that the
Inn would take care of itself, and no
more. Picking their way along the
dark road at a slow amble, they
crossed the bed of two streams then al
most dry. till at length they heard run
ning water sounding above that of the
slow wash of the sea to their left, and
Masouda bade them halt. So they
waited, until presently the moon rose
in a clear sky, revealing a wide river in
front, the pale ocean a hundred feet
beneath them to the left, and to the
right great mountains, along the face
of which their path was cut. So bright
was it that Godwin could see strange
shapes carven on the sheer face of the
rock, and beneath them writing which
he could not read.
"What are these?" he asked Ma
souda.
"The tablets of kings," she answered,
"whose names are written in your holy
book, who ruled Syria and Egypt thou
sands of years ago. They were great
in their day when they took this land,
greater even than Salah-ed-din, and
now these seals that they set upon this
rock are all that is left of them."
Godwin and Wulf stared at the
weather-worn sculptures, and in the si
lence of that moonlit place there arose
in their mind a vision of the mighty
armies of different tongues and people
who had stood In their pride on this
road and looked upon the river and the
great stone wolf that guarded it,-which
wolf, so said the legend, howled at the
approach of foes. But now he howled
no more, for he lay headless beneath
the waters, and there he lies to this
day. Well, they were dead, every one
of them, and even their deeds were for
gotten; and oh! how small the thought
of It made them feel, these two young
men bent upon a desperate quest in a
strange and dangerous land. Masouda
read what was passing in their hearts,
and as they came to the brink of the
river, pointed to the bubbles that chased
each other toward the sea, bursting
and forming again before their eyes.
"Such are we," she said briefly; "but
the ocean Is always yonder, and the
river is always here, and of fresh bub
bles there will always be a plenty. So
dance on life's water while you may,
In the sunlight, in the moonlight, be
neath the storm, beneath the stars, for
ocean calls and bubbles burst. Now
follow me, for I know the ford, and at
this season the stream Is not deep.
Pilgrim Peter, ride you at my side In
ease I should be washed from the sad
dle: and pilgrim John, come you "be
hind, and if they hang back, prick the
mules with your sword point."
Thus, then, they entered the river,
which many might have feared to do
at night, and, although once or twice
the water rose to their saddles and the
mules were stubborn in the swift
stream, in the end gained the farther
bank in safety. Thence they pursue l ."
their path through mountains till at
length the sun rose and they found
themselves in a lonely land where no
one was to be seen. Here they halted
in a grove of oaks, off-saddled their
animals, tethered and fed them with
barley which they had brought upon a
mule, and ate of the food that Masou
da had provided. Then, having secured
the beasts, they lay down to sleep, all
three of them, since Masouda said that
here there was nothing to fear; and,
being weary, slept on till the heat of
noon was past, when once more they
fed the horses and mules, and having
dined themselves, set forward upon
their way.
>i**w their roadâif road it could be
called, for they could see noneâran
ever upward through rough, mountain
ous country, where seemed to dwell
neither man nor beast. At sunset they
halted again and at moonrise went for
ward till the night turned toward
morning, when they came to a place
where was a little cave. Before they
reached this spot of a sudden the si
lence of those lonely hills was broken
by a sound of roaring, not very near to
them, but so loud and so long that it
echoed and re-echoed from the cliff. At
it the horses Flame and Smoke pricked
their ears and trembled, while the
mules strove to break away and run
back.
"What is that?" asked Wulf, who had
never heard its like.
"Lions," answered Masouda. "We
draw near the country where there are
many of them and therefore shall do
well to halt presently, since it is best
to pass through that land in daylight."
So when they came to the cave, hav
ing heard no more of the lion, or Hons,
they unsaddled there, purposing to put
the horses into it, where they .would
be safe from the attack of any such
ravening beast. But when they tried
to do this, Smoke and Flame spread out
their nostrils and setting their feet be
fore them refused to enter the place,
about which there was an evil smell.
"Perhaps Jackals have been here,"
said Masouda. "Let us tether them all
in the open."
This then they did, building: a fire in
front of them with dry wood that lay
about in plenty, for here grew somber
cedar trees. The brethren sat down by
this fire, but, the night being hot, Ma
souda laid herself down about fifteen
paces away under a cedar tree, which
grew almost in fpont of the mouth of
the cave and slept, being tired with long
riding. Wulf slept also, since Godwin
had agreed to keep watch for the first
part of the night.
For an hour or more he sat close by
the horses and-noted that they fed un
easily and would not He down. Soon,
however, he was lost in his own
thoughts, and, as he heard no more of
the lions, fell to wondering over the
strangeness of their journey and of
what the end of it might be. He won
dered also about Masouda, who she
was, how she came to know so much,
why she befriended them If she really
was a friend, and other thingsâfor in
stance, of that leap over the sunken
stream, and whether âno, surely he had
been mistaken, her eyes never looked at
him like that. Why, he was sleeping
at his post and the eyes in the darkness
yonder were not those of a woman.
Women's eyes were not green and gold;
they did not grow large, then lessen
and vanish away.
Godwin sprang to his feet. As he
thought, they were no eyes. He had
dreamed, that was all. So he took ce
dar boughs and threw them on to the
Are, where soon they flared again close
to Wulf, who was lost In heavy slum
ber.
The night was Very still and the si
lence so deep that it pressed upon him
like a weight. He could bear it no
longer, and rising, began to walk up
and down in front of the cave, drawing
his sword and holding it in his hand as
sentries do. Masouda lay upon the
ground, with her head pillowed on jbl
saddlebag and the moonlight fell
through the cedar boughs upon her
face. Godwin stopped to look at it and
wondered that he had never noted be
fore how beautiful she was.
Godwin turned aside; it seemed not
right to watch her thus, although in
ttuth he had only come to know that
she was safe. He went back to the
fire, and lifting a cedar bough, which
blazed like a torch In his left hand,
was about to lay it down again on the
center of the flame, when suddenly he
heard the sharp and terrible cry of a
ivoman in an agony of pain or fear,
md at the same moment the horses
and mules began to plunge and snort.
In an instant, the blazing bough still
in his hand, he was back by the cave,
and lo! there before him, the form of
Masouda hanging from Its Jaws, stood
a great yetlow beast, which, although
he had never seen Its like, he knew
must be a lioness. It was heading for
the cave, then catching sight of him,
turned and bounded away In the direc
tion of the fire, purposing to re-enter
the wood beyond.
But the woman in its mouth cum
bered it, and running swiftly, Godwin
came face to face with the brute just
opposite the fire. He hurled the burn
ing; bough at it, whereon it dropped
Masouda, and rearing itself straight
upon Its hind legs, stretched out its
claws and seemed about to fall on him.
For this Godwin did not wait. He was
afraid indeed, who had never fought
lions, but he knew that he must do or
die. Therefore he charged straight at
it, and with all the strength of his
strong arm drove his long sword Into
the yellow breast, till it seemed to him
that the steel vanished and he could
see nothing but the hilt. Then a shock,
a sound of furious snarling, and down
he went to earth beneath something
soft and heavy, and there his senses
left him.
When they came back again some
thing soft was still upon nls face; but
this proved to be only the hand of
who bathed his brow with a
cloth dipped In water, while Wulf
chafed his hands- Godwin sat up, and
In the light of the new-risen sun, saw
a dead lioness lying before him, Its
breast still transfixed with his own
sword.
"So I saved you," he said faintly.
"Yes, you saved me," answered Ma
souda, and kneeling down she kissed
his feet: then rising again, with her
long, soft hair wiped away the blood
that was running from a wound in his
arm.
[Continued Next Sunday.]C"T*J HERE is nothing so elusive yet

Recollection puzzles itself, finds itself
impotent, rages at its own powerless
ness. At such a moment the mind
recurs again and again with painful
insistence to the problem, and the
chance resemblance, by reason of ag
gravation, acquires an importance
wholly disproportionate. The man
who pursues such a will-o'-the-wisp
memory does so protesting in spite of
himself.
It was in some such frame of mind
that Brent Maxwell stood looking out
across the desolate hillside. The land
scape still mourned in blackened stone
walls and thinned forests, the devas
tation of Sherman's march to the sea.
The bare unpromise of the scene was
in his soul. He knew the gaunt pov
erty that follows in the wake of war.
He had fought loyally for the Union.
And now after lifteen years of recon
struction he had learned that Appo
mattox had dawned only upon the
first chapter of defeat. The fierce
patriotism which had led him, a
youth of enthusiasm and dreams of
the glory of sacrifice, to leave his
place and portion in the North when
the first call sounded and the earnest
ness of intention with which he had
Hung himself into the newly breath
ing industrial life of a Southern city
had had time to cool and sober. In
spite of success the very intensity of
the struggle against adverse condi
tions had bred in him a resentment
against the necessity which made
green field a desert, plantation a
waste and a smiling country a ceme
tery of unmarked graves. Something
of the dogged sadness which hung on
the people among whom he had elect
ed to dwell had entered into him. He
had lived down the hatred and the
sneer, but the process had made him
bitter against the circumstances which
had given this hatred rise.
On this early morning his thoughts,
which had been busy estimating the
possibilities of the farm, whose
he had in his pocket and whose fore
closure had brought him from his own
city, had been suddenly arrested and
turned from their channel. A rattling
vehicle had passed him, containing two
figuresâa man and a woman. The
faces of both had interested him. The
woman's was sad and sober-sweet,
surmounted by pearl-gray hair. There
was a little color in her cheeks. The
man had dead white hair and beard,
with face blue-tinged and shifting
eyes of yellow. He wore a heavy but
ternut overcoat and a knitted nubia
of childishly bright colors.
There was something in this last
face that started reverberating echoes
in Maxwell's brain. An intaneible
hand was at work tying together loose
ends of recollection. He knew and vet
he did not know. Wherever he looked,
as he plodded over the farm land, he
saw this blue face and dodging gaze.
It came before him with an absurd
incongruity and yet with a reiterate
malevolence.
The sun was high as he walked back
toward the village, past the great,
gray-columned house, whose sham
bling porticoes pointed to a past of
wealth and grandeur. As he neared
the gate a sudden cry made him
quicken his steps. A repeating scream
âa man's, yet wolf-like, rising and
falling with monotonous inflectionsâ
filled all the hollows with sound. Its
note had a quality of the animal that
thickened his blood. It came from the
house. The hearer broke into a run
burst open the gate and rushed to
ward the porch.
As he rounded a clump of evergreens
he saw a strange spectacle. Seated on
the ground was the blue-faced man.
his fingers clutching the stubble, his
lips emitting the beast-like screams
which had brought Maxwell from the
roadway. Bending over him with her
back toward the gate was the lady
of the sad face and the nearl gray
hair. She was smoothing the thin
fringe from the sunken temples, bend
ing now and then to lay her lips ca
ressingly and sobbingly upon his head
From under her arm the yellow eyes
looked out straight toward Maxwell.
He felt them pass shiftily across his
face with a sense of shrinking repul
sion. The volume of screams showed
no abatement.
The tones with which the woman
sought to soothe this outburst were ex
quisitely tender. "Poor Victor!" she
was saying; "poor, poor boy!"
Maxwell had stopped short at the
mad luster of those yellow eyes; the
woman had not heard his approach.
With a strange tightening of the
throat he shrank behind a bush and
retreatea to tne
road, looking fear
fully back over his
shoulder. Through
out the long walk
back to the village
hotel, at every
turning, this pic
ture started before
him â a slight,
gray-gowned fig
ure with hands
whose trembling
motions suggested
the settling of a
dove to guard Its
young, and from
under whose caress
gleamed out topaz
eyes in which
lurked the devil of
madness.
He stared over
the table of the
low-ceiled smoky
beamed dining
room, unheeding
the conversation,
his mind pursuing
the vagrant re
semblance of the
morning. He came
to himself with a
sort of shock to

all in one, walked in the fading light
up â '.he hill toward the property which
he was bo soon to send to the hammer,
there was small conversation between
them. The papers requiring the final
signature protruded from Maxwell's
greatcoat pocket. His mind was wan
dering through a labyrinth of recollec
tion, pursuing the phantom of a blue
face, surmounted by rough, white hair,
and two eyes rhot with feline yellow,
which met his and wavered away In
ferret uneasiness. The likeness clung
to him with a willful persistence, and
he swept his hand impatiently across
his eyes as though to banish the thing
that baffled him.
â¢ â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢
As the two men seated themselves
In the lamplight of the great room,
which yet bore the inextinguishable
marks of aristocracy. Maxwell became
unpleasantly aware of a huddled object
on a sofa, which, nerveless, unre
cponslve, seemed to create in itself a
center of attraction. The errand was
not a pleasant one, though relieved by
the serene face and low tones that be
long to the gentleman: but in the lax
face of old Victor Brockman- was an
other elementâan element of arrested
progress, of piteous recoilâthe genius
of unconscious despair. It drew Max
well, while it repelled him. He found
himself turning his head to gaze
upon it.
He realized in the midst of a genial
sentence that the yellow eyes had ceas
ed their roving, and now settled, fixed
and stealthy, upon his face. The ag
gravating resemblance again caught
his attention.
Thereafter he ceased to be himselfâ
ceased in some inexplicable way to
feel his will and intention master of
the situation. The idiot's gaze had
got upon his nerves. He found himself
shifting in his seat, pushing his chair
back by slow degrees to bring the
lounge or thÂ« table between him and
it. Now and then he turned his eyes
unwillingly to meet that look; the yel
low eyes had ceased to twitch and now
rested with. It seemed to him, a quiet,
dreamy malevolence upon his own. The
gaze affected him strangely; it sn
eered him. He felt himself put out by
his meaningless persistence. His
smooth sentences flowed with less ease
and he felt a nervous contraction in
the muscles of his throat.
Miss Anne had drawn nearer to the
squat occupant of the sofa, and her
hand, trembling unwontedly, he
thought, reached out now and then to
touch the frayed sleeve. And surely
the lawyer was looking at him closely
and cunningly. Maxwell felt himself
sweating and yet internally Scoffing at
this strange mood that had smitten
him.
The situation was a simple one, and
yet It had suddenly become impossible
to him. He, Brent Maxwell, land own
er, dealer in farm properties, had come
to present an official paper for signa
ture. He had done It scores of times
and yet the usual conversation with
which custom softens the unpleasant
alternatives of business failure into
kindly and courteous agreement had
become suddenly a way of painâa
chapter of indefinable reproach. A
look of vacant, yellow eyes, grown
steadfast, was making this hour one of
loathing and horror.
As the last words were spoken and
the necessary signatures were affixed,
he snatched the papers from the law
yer's hands, crushed them Into his
pocket, and, in sudden revuJslon, his
tense nerves released, sprang to his
feet.
The effect upon the huddled figure
opposite him was instantaneous and
terrible. He cringed backward, with a
shrinking gesture of fear and agony.
His palsied arms, shaking and uncer
tain. " wavered before his face. A
shriek came from his lips, but this
time not the monotonous, wordless
wall of his habit, but an articulate cry.
"My God! My head! don't strike me
again!"
Maxwell dimly heard the sobbing
cry with which the sister's arms went
round the cowering, abject figure, and
the lawyer's abrupt ejaculation of as
tonishment and reassurance, as he
rushed to the door and flung himself
out in the frosty evening. His breath
was coming heavily, and his fingers
worked nervously in and out of
clenched fists, and, as the sky opened
before him, a vision hurled Itself with
the appalling directness of a thunder
bolt before himâa vision of an acre of
bloody, trampled sward, iron-sown,
and blue wUh pungent wreaths of
smoke. In the foreground a disman
tled gun prone upon whose stock a
figure lay with blackened face and
tattered gray uniform, and over it a
second figure swinging a clubbed mus
ket, remorseless, cruel with the lust of
war. The crest of that spattered knoll
strewn with quiet formsâthese two
alone, fiercely erect. Then the clubbed
weapon descended. From the limp fig
ure stretched across the gun rose two
protesting armsâtwo hazel eyes looked
from beneath the bloody mat of hair,
and a voice shrill and terrifying: "M 7
God! My head! don't strike mo
again!"
The vision blurred, gusts of smoke
came in between. Did the blue figure
strike again? D!d it? Did it?
Maxwell threw his hands toward
the night sky, that had flared with
that quick rise of condemnation and
died again, as though appealing and
inviting doom. The vision had scarce
faded into the dun of the early night
sky when the lawyer came down the
steps; it was as though he had ap
proached, black-robed and grotesque,
from the corner of the dimming pic
ture âa vengeance witnessing and im
peaching, binding him. Brent Maxwell,
of that savage battery charge, to the
Brent Maxwell of this day, a strong
man flying from the piteous pallor of
a shrunken and deranged wreck.
The one UDon whom "this sudden
panic of soul had crashed like a fall
ing tower gripped him fiercely by the
arms. "The man in there." he said,
hoarsely, "the man with the blue face
and yellow eyesâthe man that looked
at me! Did you see him look at me?"
The other shrank back half fear
fully. "Why, Maxwell." he said,
"what's the matter? It was merely
a fit of some sort. I thought you
knew he was crazy. Why, man, you're
shaking! Come along and we'll get
something to warm us up."
"Did you see him put up his
hands?"
The lawyer drew away his arm
almost angrily. "Heavens!" he said.
"You're almost as bad as the old man
himself. He's crazy, I tell youâ
plumb crazy, and has been ever since
they brought him home from the war.
He was struck in the head by a shell
or somethingâ"
"Yes, yes. Where? Where was it?
What battle was it?"
"I've always heard it was at Mis
sionary Ridge." The match he struck
against his boot heel burned, sput
tering, as he bit the end from a cigar.
Maxwell suddenly drew from his
pocket the packet of papers; the
parchment crackled as he reached for
ward and held a curling corner to
the flame. It caught and licked about
it. While the lawyer stood in amaze.
Maxwell waved it, a flaming funnel,
around his head until it scorched his
fingers. As he dropped It to the
ground, a mass of slowly blackening
embers, a white shadow sprang out of
the surrounding circle of blackness,
it was Miss Anne.
"Miss Anne," cried the lawyer, "do
you see what he's doing? He's burned
up the mortgage 1 He's burned it up!
That's all that's left of it there on the
ground."
Miss Anne stepped forward half-fear
fully, her fascinated eyes on the glow
ing firebrand between them. She
clasped her hands together. "Sir," she
said painfully, "sir"âthen she stopped.
An overmastering desire seized him
to take upon himself the act of that
dead dayâto shout to them both that
he, he had been asked mercy and had
denied it. It was the right of war, but
now, after all these years, it had re
coiled upon him in shame. Circum
stances had again put in his hand the
weapon; the lust of acquisition called
upon him to strike, but as he stood
face to face with this new victim out of
that red mist of the stained past that
cry had sounded, and his hand dropped
nerveless before the same helpless, ac
cusing eyes. He would have shouted
that it was not charity, not kindness,
that spared that roof, but self-accusa
tionâa yearning for atonement and for
absolution.
He received her tears of gratitude
with a sense of shame upon his soul, and
the lawyer's bluff
comments upon
h 1 s benefaction
pierced him like
swords of searing.
â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢
As Maxwell turn
ed again toward
the village he rest
ed his gaze upon
the hillside sleep
ing under the early
stars. Field and
knoll were covered
silvery with the
sheen of hoar
frost lances. It
seemed the dwarf
symbol of burled
armies â thousands
upon thousands of
the dead who died,
with upthrust bay
onets still stand
ing to guard In
death the Integrity
of homes. And
standing thus, with
the sorrow of this
upon him, Maxwell
cried to his own
soul, no less than
to his land, to
glory, to power, to
war and to Victory,
"What have you
done' What have
yon done?"ONCE more the cry for good high
ways and roads has been raised.
And, what is more to the point,
raised with a vengeance, for
California is just beginning to realize
that she is far behind her sisters in this
respect.
But, fortunately for us all, the tide
-as turned and the people who have
need of roads have begun to realize
that good highways are not only a
source of great pleasure and comfort,
but a real, positive source of wealth as<
well, and that it is within their control
and reach.
Just about the time the industrial de
velopment of this State had nearly
reached the limit possible with bad
roads Governor Budd signed a bill for
the institution of a Bureau of High
ways. This was made a law in 1890.
This first bureau was composed of a
committee of threeâR. C. Irvine. Mars
den Manson and J. L. Maudeâwho
were appointed for a term of two years.
After an investigation they made a re
port thru for the fiscal year cf 1894
and 1895 about two million dollars hai
been expended on the improvement of
roads exclusive of cities and towns.
A\'ith ail this the roads were in a de
plorable condition and that there was
absolutely no system in the way they
had beÂ«.n located and constructed.
The remedy they offered was not a
series of t hnnzos in the law, but sys
tematlc plans that were to be followed
â¢ â¢lit to the letter. âU the same time
they also recommended that the roads
â¢be classified into three divisionsâState
highways, county thoroughfares and
district roads. To such an extent did
th< y follow up their suggestions thaS
bills Were at once introduced into the
' â¢ :.?lature to carry out their ideas..
In brief, their recommendations were
that the maximum rate of taxation pro
scribed by law for road purposes,
should be lowered from 40 cents to 35
cents per $100 of assessed valuation.
That one-haif this reduction ânamely,'
2* 2 centsâshould be relevied on all
property within the State for the con-,
and maintenance of high-"
ways of State importance. That the!
roads be classified according to their/
importance to the State to the various
counties thereof and to the districts
which they served.
When the above measures came be
fore the Legislature of 1897 the essen
tial principles were essentially modi
fied. So much so, in fact, that the au
thors had difficulty in recognizing them.
The Legislature passed a bill creat
ing a department of highways and at
the same time levied a tax of 2% cents
for State highway purposes. This was
passed on to Governor Budd for his
signature and he promptly approved
the bill creating the Department of
Highways, but vetoed the bill creating
a State tax for road purposes. At the
same time the Legislature also passed
what Is known as the "Clarke"
road law; a law that took the
handling of all road matters
out of the hands of the Supervisors
and placed It in the hands of
Trustees in the different road districts
of the State. The bill was signed by
Governor Budd, but before it went Into
operation the Supreme Court in the
case of Davis vs. Whidden declared it
Illegal on account of the manner it had
been passed through the Legislature.
The highway commissioners appointed
at this time were W. L. Ashe. Marsden
Manson and J. R~ Price, and it was
their duty to build State roads (they
being required to give heavy bonds)
with ths money the Legislature pro
vided from the 2%-cent tax levy, which
bill the Governor vetoed.
After assuming office the members
of the department of highways kept up
the work of the Bureau of High
ways, investigating the road conditions
and the expenditure of money for road
purposea In May, 1898, they met with
the State convention of the Supervis
ors in Napa After a general discussion
between the Commissioners and the Su
pervisors the Commissioners request
ed the Supervisors to appoint a com
mittee of five to confer with them and
the Code Commissioners to see what
could be done in the way of bringing
system into the management of the
roads of California. After much dis
cussion the Supervisors refused to ap
point a committee to confer witâ the
Highway Commissioners, but passed a
resolution that they should adjourn to
meet in Sacramento and oppose any
legislation that the Highway Commis
sioners might suggest.
The department of ' highways had
bills Introduced in the Legislatureâ
first, to classify the roads, and. sec
ond, to so amend the road laws that
60 per cent of all money raised for
road purposes should be spent for per
manent road work and defined what
permanent road work should be. The
main reason the department of high
ways had for suggesting the 50 per cent
law was that they found that most of
the money raised for road purposes
was spent for patchwork on wooden
structures and graveling roads that
were not properly drained.
The Supervisors met in Sacramento
during the session of the Legislature
to oppose these measures, but when
their committee appeared before the
road committee or the Assembly and
were informed of the nature and pur
poses of the bills introduced by the de
partment of highways they publicly
withdrew all opposition. Consequently
these bills passed the Legislature, but
for some reason or other never made
known to the members of the depart
ment of highways. Governor Gage
withheld his signature and these meas
ures failed to become the laws, en
abling the people to have, at least, a
million dollars, a year to spend on def
inite lines for work of a permanent
nature out of the funds that were
raised for road purposes in this State,
namely, something over two million
dollars a year.
The Grand Jury of Sonoma County
in its report recommended that the
members of the Legislature do some
thing to remedy the present road con
ditions. The Dunbar Improvement
Club took the hint from the Grand
Jury and called a "County Good Road
Convention," to be held In Glen Ellen.
They invited the Board of Supervisors,
all ex-Supervisors, members of the
Legislature, all ex-members of the Leg
islature and the different grangers and
Improvement clubs to send delegates,
also to send to the secretary any rec
ommendations in writing they might
have to better the present road condi
tion. The convention discussed the dif
ferent recommendations made to it In
writing and appointed a committee to
take these various recommendations,
to digest the same and report to the
club what they thought best to rec
ommend to the Legislature. The re
port gives the exact state of affairs, for
it embodies all the grievances and sug
gests practical remedies for the new
road laws which are to be submitted
to the coming Legislature. It Is as
follows:
The present road law makes no dis
tinction between roads of different
character and use; it applies to all
roads alike. Under it each Supervisor
is ex-Offlcio Road Commisloner for his
district. Supervisors are elected by
districts according to population.
As a board the Supervisors levy the
taxes and audit and allow* the claims
against the county, and as individual
Road Commissioners they themselves
expend the road funds, thus In effect
auditing and allowing their own
claims. Such a system is bad and lia
ble to lead to abuses.
Each Supervisor as Road Commis
sioner appoints or employs in each road
district some person as roadmaster, and
it is needless to say that political af
filiations and services usually play a
part in the selection of such persons,
which, as a rule, does not tend to se
curing a fair equivalent in work for
the money Apended.
The present road law limits the amount
which can be levied for road purposes
to 40 cents per SftO assessed valuation,
and in the county government act of
1893 there is a further provision au
thorizing the levy of a special road fund
tax of 2 mills on the dollar assessed
valuation for the construction and
maintenance of the main public roads
in the several road districts, to be dis
tributed in proportion to the amount
collected from such districts.
The Board of Supervisors have rarely
levied the full amount of 40 cents, and
the further provision of the act of 1593,
which merely in effect authorizes an
additional amount, has therefore re
mained a dead letter.
There is also a provision in the
present law requiring where the esti
mated' cost of any work upon high
ways amounts to $30 or more, it shall
be done by contract.
This provision has remained a dead
letter because it is so easily evaded,
and the method is too cumbersome, as
applied to ordinary roads.
The present law also provides that
the Board of Supervisors may set
apart, not exceeding thirty-five per
cent of the road taxes collected, as a
general road fund for such general
county road purposes In which the In
habitants of all the road districts with
in the county are more or less inter
ested, or to assist weak districts.
This provision has also remained a
dead letter for the reason that as the
Supervisors are elected by districts, ac
cording to population, even if the fund
were set apart, each of them would
naturally try to get as much of, it as
possible to be expendedjn his district,
both to please his constituents, and
because as Road Commissioner he
would do the spending; hence they
could never agree upon where the
money was to be spent, and in actual
practice all they can ever agree upon
Is that each Supervisor shall expend
the money collected In his district.
These districts, however, being set
off according to population vary great
ly in revenue. The districts including
mountainous country are usually
sparsely settled and are therefore
A
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY GALâ.
larger than other districts In the richer
and more level country, so that under
the present laws, the larger districts
having the most road mileage and the
most difficult and costly roads to con
struct and maintain, usually have the
least money available, while the more
thickly populated, smaller and usually
more level districts, where the road
mileage is less and the expense of
building and maintaining roads is least,
have the most money.
But that Is not all, the foregoing evils
are further aggravated under our pres
ent laws in the following manner:
The Board of Supervisors divide the
several Supervisor districts into road
districts, which in practice amounts to
each Supervisor dividing his district
into such road districts as he chooses.
The road taxes collected in each road
district are expended in that district
only.
Now, human nature is selfish and the
result is that the more populous and
richer sections by the weight of their
influence in elections have always suc
ceeded in having themselves set off in
road districts by themselves, which
necessarily sets off the poorer sections
also by themselves, and thus we have
the same anomaly repeated again, of
the district having the most
difficult and costly roads to maintain
having the least revenue, and the more
thickly populated districts with less
road mileage, where the expense of
building and maintaining roads Is less,
having the most revenue.
How any sane person can expect to
maintain general roads, traversing a
number of road districts, In anything
like a uniform or fair condition un
der such circumstances is beyond com
prehension. Under such a system the
county presents the appearance qf a
patchwork quilt, so far as roads are
concerned, and under such a system
we can never have good roads.
The capacity of a road's service is
limited to the worst part of It; no
greater load can be hauled over it than
over the worst part of It.
The present road system is a relic of
a bygone primitive age and should be
changed as early as practicable.
One of the first and fundamental
changes that are needed is a classifica
tion of roads. There are two separate
and distinct classes of publio roads,
vis:
General or principal roads and local
roads, the one traveled by people
generally and the other merely by peo
ple of a neighborhood; the one has to
bear a heavy traffic and the other only
light traffic, therefore the one must
be constructed better and more sub
stantial than the other; the one serves
many people and the other compara
tively few. In a word they serve dif
ferent purposes and require different
administration. Some central county
authority must administer the general
county roads, while the local roads
may with advantage be administered
by local authority.
The general county roads should be
built and maintained by taxation upon
all the taxable property of the county,
including that In incorporated cities
and towns, and local roads should be
built and maintained by taxation in
the local road districts. The two funds
should be separate and distinct. The
State should also aid In maintaining
general county roads In a similar man
ner and upon the same principle that
it assists In maintaining our public
schools.
State institutions are lo
cated the State should construct and
maintain necessary streets or roads,
to serve at the same time as models,
through or fronting its property, for
the reason that the State pays no road
laxes and it is unjust to Impose tne
burden of maintaining those streets or
mads through or fronting State prop
erty upon the Â«'ity or road district
The local roads should be administer
ed by a board of three trustees in each
road district, elected in the same man
ner as School Trustees are elected, and
to serve as School Trustees now do,
without pay. They should employ a
roadmaster, the same as School Trus
tees employ a teacher, and they should
estimate annually the amount neces
sary to build and maintain their local
roads, which, within the limits provid
ed by law, should be levied by the Su
pervisors on the property in the dls
trict.
The segregation of general county
roads from local roads will make it
practicable to bave all the work on the
general county roads done by contract,
construction as well as maintenance.
For purpose of maintenance the general
county roads should be divided into
sections and the care and maintenance
thereof given out by contract, with
proper safeguards, to the lowest and
best bidder.
These provisions will eliminate poll
tics from the road system altogether.
In a large State like California, pre
senting so many different conditions
and topographical features, no set of
minute rigid rules can be adopted for
the classification of general and local
roads applicable all over the State, and
the determination of the question must
to a great extent be left to the Board
of Supervisors in each county.
The State law should make certain
general requirements as to width and
grades and so forth of general county
roads, but it should be left to each
county, through its Board of Supervis
ors, to classify its roads.
The State law should provide regula
tions and standards for the construc
tion and maintenance of general
county roads which the State assists
in maintaining. Such State aid should
be in the form of a bounty or pre
mium of a certain amount paid to the
county road fund for each mile of
road constructed and maintained ac
cording to State standards and re
quirements.
If this standard requires an aver
age expenditure of from $3000 to $5000
per mile of road, and if the State aid
for maintenance were $500 ncr mile
of such roads, there is no danger
that the State treasury would be
swamped â¢ by State aids to roads,
for people would not be very eager to
expend $5000 to get $500 from the
State for maintaining it. And besides
it would be of slow growth, for after
maintaining their general roads out of
the general county road fund the
County Road Commissioners would not
have money available to build many
miles of standard road in each year;
but the State aid would act as an in
centive and the object lesson to the
people in each county, of a few miles
of standard road would popularize
them, and after a beginning was once
made a greater proportion would be
constructed each year thereafter, so
that in ten or twenty years our, main
roads would probably all be standard
roads. Such roads when once construct
ed are maintained with comparatively
little expense, which in time, with the
State aid to help out the county fund,
would help to construct more and more
standard roads.
Under the present law each Road
Commissioner and roadmaster works
his road according to his own ideas,
which are often very crude and fre
quently wasteful.
Road building is a trade or business
as" much as house building is. No sano
man would spend many thousands of
dollars each year in any construction
or business in the way our road funds
are expended.
There ought to be certain standards
and regulations adopted for the con
struction, repair and maintenance of
the different classes of roads, which
should be published in each county
under some general requirements to
be prescribed by State law. and public
money should only be expended in ac
cordance with such requirements.
In that case the people could see and
watch if the requirements were com
plied with, and money would not then
be wasted, as it now often is.
For the purpose of gradually better
ing existing roads the law should also
provide that certain minimum propor
tion of all road taxes collected be ex
pended only for permanent improve
ments of such roads until they are
brought up to the standards and re
quirements adopted.
Summarizing our conclusions we rec
ommend that our road laws be changed
to provide as fundamental features the
following:
FirstâClassification of public roads
into local roads, general county roads
and standard county roads receiving
State aid.
SecondâThat the State law shall
prescribe certain general regulations
and standards for the construction,
repair and maintenance of local and
general county roads and authorize and
require the Board of Supervisors in
each county to provide further gen
eral regulations and standards, within
the limits allowed by State law for
such construction, repair, maintenance,
within each county, and that the State
law shall prescribe all regulations and
standards for the construction, repair
and maintenance of standard county
reads receiving State aid.
All such regulations to be published
so as to be in the hands of all the
officials, including local trustees and
road overseers and citizens generally,
and that no public money shall be ex
pended except in accordance with such
regulations and standards.
ThirdâThat local roads shall be un
der the control of a board of three
trustees in each district, elected as
School Trustees are now elected, who
shall employ a road overseer for each
district, in a similar manner as school
trustees employ a teacher.
The construction, repair and mainte
nance of local roads shall be under the
immediate control of the road trustees
and overseers of the several road dis
tricts under the general supervision
of the County Board of Road Com
missioners and county road superin
tendent.
For the construction, repair and
maintenance of local roads, local taxes
6hall be levied and collected in the re
spective road districts upon estimates
furnished by such local trustees within
the limits to be prescribed by law.
FourthâThat there shall be In each
county a County Board of Road Com
sioners and a county road superin
tendent, who must be a properly quali
fied civil engineer.
That such County Road Commission
ers be elected by the qualified electors
of the county at large, and that those
first elected shall hold office for two.
four and six years respectively, and
thereafter one to be elected at each
general election and hold office for six
years, and that the county road su
perintendent shall be elected by the
Board of Supervisors in each county.
FifthâThat such County Board of
Road Commissioners shall have juris
diction over all matters relating to the
construction, repair and maintenance
of the general county roads and stand
ard or State-aided roads, and that they
and the county road superintendent
shall exercise a supervisory control
over the local road trustees and over
expenditures for local roads in a simi
lar manner as the County Board of Ed
ucation and School Superintendent su
pervise the local School Trustees.
SixthâThat the general county roads
and standard or State-aided roads shall
be constructed and maintained by tax
ation of all the taxable property in the
county as a whole, including that in
cities and incorporated towns, and that
the State shall contribute from the
State treasury a certain sum per mile
annually for the maintenance of such
roads, when constructed according to
prescribed State standards and require
ments, and when such roads have been
accepted by the State, as constructed
according to the requirements provided
by law, such State aid to cease when
ever said roads are not maintained ac
cording to such standards and require
ments. That the State shall pay for
the construction, repair and mainten
ance of all streets or public roads front
ing upon or passing through State
property.
SeventhâThat all work on general
county roads and standard or State
aided roads, either construction or re
pair, or maintenance, shall be done by
contract, under proper safeguards and
restrictions, and shall be let to the low
est and best bidder, and that for the
purpose â¢of repair and maintenance
such roads shall be divided into con
venient sections.
EighthâThat for the purpose of
bringing existing roads to the stand
ards and requirements adopted the law
require a certain minimum proportion
of road funds collected to be expended
only for the permanent Improvements
thereon until such roads are brought
up to such standards. Â«Copyright, 1004. by Charles P. Dryden.

of 50 cents" and an accumulation of
caked mud on my person which no
wasp could ever hope to acquire. All
I needed was some foliage among my
hair to be a Human Flower Pot. In
that shape I fell into a home among
the horses, but I reached the livery
stable by a painfully circuitous route.
This was it:
On coming back to Houston the dry
culvert that had been my home be
fore seeking genteel employment In
the railroad camp was still open to
me. There I passed a thoughtful
night. The iron foundry was still in
a state of coma and my mud-em

spoiling dat Mr. Paul and Miss Fannie
is giving de child dese days. Of course
your child will be proud and glad to
come to de boithday party, but sor
row de day dat he is let to come as an
equal."
"Merci blen for de good advice,"
says Duchess, "but who told you dat
my boy is to grow up to be a solvent?
Maybe he will be a general in de army,
or de President, or even a chef in a
great hotel. Who knows? Dis is a
free country, and a boy who gets loin
ing and behaves himself and is honest
and wise and industrious has as much
chance of being taken care of by some
nice trust, and made something out
of, as de next boy. Why not?"
"Dose is onlj% de pipe dreams of a

wishes your son well, Hortense, me
dear, but it will be' better for him to
remember dat de bosses and de trusts
don't go looking around for de sons

enough sons of de rich for to go
around, without calling in any of de
common people. But do let me see de
lad's letter saying how proud he is
dat he gets an invite to Little One's

poor child."
Say, Housekeeper may be right about
de way she has doped it about dat de
sons of de poor being a long shot when
it comes to deir getting next to de mugs
dat runs de Government and tings, but
she has anodder guess coming to her
about de way Kiddie takes it dat he
is invited to Little One's party. I wrote
to him to tell de Head Teacher dat he
was to come home for de party, and to
*f IS name was Thomas Jefferson,
L_J and he was constructed ac-
I cordlngly. In his youth he was
*S one of the most promising boys
in the neighborhood, and his
promises are still outstanding; so far
as we know, none of them has ever
been paid. His life story Is an illus
tration of one of the saddest facts in
human history, and during our narra
tion It will *be well to keep that fact in
mind. We are not quite sure what it
is we are to illustrate, but we hope to
find out In time to put It In the appen
dix. Then, if the doctors don't re
move the appendix it will be preserved
for the edification of posterity.
In his childhood Thomas Jefferson
was what is known as a. precocious
child. That is, he was one of those
specimens of infant genius designed for
the discouragement of social inter
course with his family. He could put
the boy on the burning d*k and then
go off and leave him there three times
in one evening, and come up smiling
each time. He could also give an Imi
tation of the boy soprano in the city
choir almost as good as tne real thing.
His parents were sure that he was in
tended for something great, and their
efforts were directed toward fostering
that belief in the mind of their Inno
cent offspring. Parents have a good
deal to answer for, although it Is sad
tv think that any one should have to
answer for Thomas Jefferson.
When thatÂ» budding genius had
reached an age when even his own
parents were willing to dispense with

balmed ga no ste red me off the
track of other joos. I was a hobo for
fair. The railroad track leading
north looked good to me, so at day
light on the second morning I moved
away from Houston on foot, never to
return. Any old place would do. My
one ambition was to shake the dust
of Texas from my feet. The soil is
not so easy to shake when a fellow Is
Japanned with that rich alluvium.
By noon I wearied of the telegraph
poles and hand car shanties â¢ flitting
past. At these latter institutions I
paused and asked for work, but my
nationality was against me. Keenly
did I regret not having been born a
Swede or Italian, so as to inherit a pair
of leather pants from my father and a
good job in America. At midday I
left the track and took a short nap in
a clump of trees. Professional tsamps
sleep in the middle of the day, and I
had been long enough in the business
to enjoy certain of the luxuries. I
awoke with a new idea, which was to
switch off into the country and hire out
to a farmer. All the train robber, cow
boy and Texas ranger romance had
been jolted out of me by this time, and
I actually yearned to be a farmer. A
wagon road led away from the track
through woods and swamps, and I fol
lowed it, keeping a sharp lookout for
farms. Here and there stood a negro
cabin in the center of a dead and bar
ren fleld, with no sign of life. These
were not the kind of farms I had seen
In Illinois and lowa. The idea of be
coming a tiller of the soil began to
ooze, but there was no use turning
back.
Along toward dusk the smoke and
spires of a city loomed up in the dis
tance, and at sight of them I cut the
last link that bound me to the farmers.
In this new city, the name bf which I
didn't know, I would find friends and
work and get on my feet, or rather off
them, for I was pretty tired. Within
ar mile of the place I met up with a
truck farm, aglow with early spring
vegetables. The owner, a thin man,
with pale whiskers, was pulling weeds
near the fence. I hung my chin over
the top rail, and asked him the name of
the town.
"Houston," he said, without looking
up.
"What!" I yelled. "Houston, did you
say? Why, I left there early this morn
ing, and have been walking all day."
The truck farmer straightened his
long, lean back, and took a good look
at me.

chase himself along. Dis is de letter I
gets from him in answer. Copy It as
he .wrote it, for he doesn't sling de
American langwudge so good as me,
and I don't want to trun no bouquets
at him like reporting him in me own
woids. Here's de letter:
"Dear Dad I take my pen in my
left hand because my right got a swat
from a hockey stick by a boy playing
off which < licked him after the game
to tell you that I have your letter to
come home. That is too bad. If I
have to go to Fannies party I'll miss
the inter-school hockey championship
game and that Is better than any old
party especial by girls. Girls are no
good. If you play with them you can't
play hard because nurse will tell if you
nock them down which is what any
boy gets licked for. For telling. Be
sides they can't fight. Girls can't.
What good are they then?-- Besides, a
fellow has always to remember to be
polite to girls or get called to the sta
bles to find out what else a hitching 4
strap is for besides hitching. I know
that already. Being polite is no good.
Of course I am polite to seenyers be
cause they are bigger and can fight
too. But one seenyers said to fne
Fadden you did not call me Mister
when we came out of chapel this
morning and I will spank you so that
you will remember to be polite. I
told him that a spanking didn't help
politeness and that the reason I didn't
call him Mister was that I was trad
ing hockey sticks with a fellew and
forgot. So he took my hockey stick
*nd let me off. I won fifty cents from
a boy who gets a big allowance but
doesn't know heads from tales and so
is a easy mark matching nickels, and
I will gjve the fifty cents to Fanie if
she will let me off from the party. I
know the kinds of kids who will be at
her party and they are bum. Their
hair kurls and their nales are pink
like a woman's. To the candy shop
with such kids. They play ring around
a rosy and when I say lets play seeing
his Bociety it was decided to palm him
oft on an unsuspecting college for four
or five years, as the case might be.
While he was absorbing an education
and learning how to inhale a cigarette
without coughing Thomas Jefferson
was giving a steady imitation of an all
round Intellectual champion- He wrote
poetry for the college paper which he
could almost have sold to one of the
big magazines; his college play was ad
mitted to be a corker although for some
invidious reason another fellow landed
the assignment for the college show;
and his stories came within a few
inches of making a big hit. Each time
Thomas Jefferson turned out some
thing good In one or the other of these
fields of intellectual gymnastics he was
assured by all his admiring friends
that if he stuck to it he would probably
make a great name for himself some
day and might even earn enough
money to pay his laundry blue. But
Thomas could always think of some
thing else that he would rather tarn
his attention to at the moment, arid
besides doing too much of one thing
looked too much like hard work.
This was all right in college, for no
one expects a college boy to overtax
his brain. If he actually studied now
and then he might take to asking ques
tions of his professors and then the
whole academic structure, would be
overturned. So we reaffirm that It is
all very well for the hunter of the
elusive sheepskin to dally with his In
tellect and guide It hither and yon,
but when It comes down to business
where a man expects to be paid real
money by some one else the case is
somewhat different, as we shall see In
our consideration of Thomas Jefferson.
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL).
"Young stranger," he said, "I ain't
deef and I ain't crazy. That's Houston.
Be you all going thar?"
He put the query in such a tone that
I at once hiked on to Houston, without
further parley. What's the use, I ar
gued. The man lives here and I'm a
stranger in these parts. He ought to
know. But how did I get back to Hous
ton, after walking for ten hours away
from that place? This proposition made
me dizzy. In books of adventure I had
read of lost people wandering In a
circle. I was not lost, for there was
Houston In plain view. Apparently I
had got fatally bent on my travels.
The wagon road, crossed by other
trails, wound about the country and
led me astray. It all seems funny now.
but the ring I walked around a town
ship was no joke in those days. No
matter whether I rode or strolled away
from Houston the city was bound to
turn up again and haunt me. As I
neared my bad ->enny I fretted lest
another hobo had found the dry cul
vert.
My happy home was still to let and,
footsore and disgusted, I passed the
night there, with a homeless dog, who
came in from a late foray, smelling of
food I would have been tempted to eat
had he brought home some.
One word in this sign, "Livery,
Boarding and Sale Stable," on a large
building led me to try my luck among
the horses. The word would stand no
show on the puzzle page, for you have
all guessed it by this time. The stable
proprietor did not at first want any
hostlers, but he took an interest in the
mud I carried and asked me how I got
it. That query opened up a vein of
conversation that eventually landed me
in the box stall with the red stallion.
In three weeks of diligent hustling I
had earned 80 cents in bunches of 30
and 50 cents and I doubtless resembled
the first installment of my Texas in
come.
The liveryman had a big heart and
I'll never forget him. When I had
reeled off my tale of woe he asked me
why I didn't come to him when I first
struck town. Then he led the way to a
restaurant and fed the queerest patron
ever seen In that place. He remained
and watched me eat and it was well
he did, for no one but a horse owner
could have paid the bill. In a voice
choked with wonder and emotion the
horsey Samaritan offered me a position
as chambermaid in his livery stable at
three per week and board. He and his
wife lived In the upper part of the
stable and boarded the hands.

Naturally Thomas Jefferson's first
thought after being released from the
academic pasture was of newspaper
work.
It is a strange fact, but a true one,
that about seventy-five per cent, of
the men who emerge into the world
yearly from the reposeful gloom of our
cloistered halls of learning have their
eye on some poor newspaper which
they think needs bracing up, and at
least fifty per cent of them actually try
it. It must be because most young men
think of the newspaper man as a leis
urely individual, who spends most of ihs
time eating breakfast with Senator
Piatt or careering around the country
in a special train with the President
sending back telegrams to his paper
when he feels like it. When they dis
cover that newspaper work is very
much like other work, only harder, they
change their minds and ask for a job
on the street cleaning force, where they
can work easy hours and be sure of
their Job for at least three weeks in
succession.
But as we said before, Thomas Jeffer
son made a straight break, for a news
paper office as soon as he felt the
asphalt under his feet and announced
that he was prepared to accept a posi
tion. After cooling his heels in two
or three offices Thomas Jefferson man
aged to get on the blind side of a city
editor and was given an assignment
to cover a cat show. His copy passed
muster and he was gradually promoted
to higher things such as the strika. of
the sign painters' union and accidents
om the elevated railroad and other phe
nomena of modern civilization. The
road seemed open to him all the way up
âor downâto the managing editor's
Then I went to bunk in with the
equines. My duties consisted of mak- %
ing beds for the horses and giving a
massage to overheated hack teams
with a bit of gunny sack. Another
hostler cut my hair with a pair of
horse clippers while I sat on a bucket,
and then he helped me to take a bath
with the hose in the buggy washing
department. It was a buggy wash all
right. During these operations I lost
considerable mud and felt better for
it. I had a good home in the stable.
It was killing work to tumble out of
my hay at odd hours and dry a team
of lather-covered horses, but I soon
got used to it. My roommate snorted
and kicked a great deal in the night
with big iron-shod hoofs, and his resÂ«
tive demeanor robbed me of much
sleep.
Among the patrons of the stable
was a half-breed Mexican named
Wood, who drove a night hack, pay
ing a stated sum for the nocturnal use
of the team and vehicle. The fact
that Mr. Wood had lost the greater
part of his nose, bitten off in a friend
ly argument with a fellow night
hawk, did not predispose one in his
favor, but he took a hot fancy to me.
The reason did not appear till later.
One evening Mr. Wood said he
had never seen a white person with
whom he would rather associate than
myself. That was flattering some, as
the hackman had negro blood in him.
My many sterling traits of mind and
character, to say nothing of the way
I rubbed sweaty horses, appealed so
strongly to Mr. Wood he actually
pined for my society. He spoke about
it himself. In fact, rather than mis**
hobnobbing with me, at least part of
the time, the enamored Mr. Wood of
fered me $1 per night to sit with him
on the box seat of the hack and con
verse on general topics. As he was
willing to pay for good society, and 1
needed the money, I agreed to bright
en the life of the lonely hackman,
since a shift of hours had given me
the day watch at the barn.
Night after night, at 8 o'clock, the
hack rolled out of the stable. Mr.
Wood sat on the box, soaking up social
distinction, with mo by his side. When
waiting at the hack stand in front of
a saloon, the driver allowed me to curl
up on the cushions and sleep while he
stood at the bar and drank milk
punches. Sometimes he favored me

the city room of a vulgar newspaper
office, so Thomas Jefferson resigned his
positionâand himself to the inevitable
âand foregathered with bis intellect in
the hall room-ef a Harlem boarding
house.
At the end of that time he had com
pleted the layout for the costumes in
the second act and was almost ready
to think about beginning to get ready
to write the play, had it not happened
as he was shaving one morning that
he conceived of a way by which he
could beat the stock market and so
hand out a few hot ones to the pluto
crats of Wall street. His play was
allowed to languish in the durance vile
of his bottom bureau drawer while
Thomas Jefferson hied him away to the
home of the bulls and bears and the
lambs that are led to the slaughter.
His plan consisted of the simple
method of buying when prices are low
and selling when they are high. As
no one had ever though of that before,
T. Jefferson reaped an exceeding great
profit, being able to pay his office rent
in advance for as much as a whole
monthâsometimes.
Then he concluded that the sordid
materialism of the commercial world
was too trying for his sensitive nerves.
Anyway he had always intended to be
a lawyer, although he had never
thought of It before. Therefore he

The nights were chilly, and I had no
overcoat. My friend bought me one
just like his own. He said if I caught
cold and died my folks at Mudville, 111.,
never would forgive him for exposing
my health. He also gave me a hat that
resembled his.
Along toward 3 or 4 o'clock in the
morning business grew slack and Mr.
Wood had me drive him home. He lived
on the other side of town, two miles
from the stable, but he always trusted
me with the task'of taking the team
back. Arriving at his house. Mr.
Wgod handed me a silver dollar, and
followed by an affectionate "good

and hat brim down, I fancied that my
clever handling of the reins led boozy

enjoyed these thrills, and then one
night the hackman failed to call for

he'd called de kiddies out to play, not

only bottled up Duchess, and when
she did uncork on me later I heard

both ends against the middle and de

Ab our patient hearers have prob

fourth act on the broad stage of real
life was very much like his other three.
He made a great play at the galleries
for two or three months and then
quietly faded away because some
easier and more popular way of mak
ing a living had occurred to him. In
the course of the next ten years he was
successivelyâand rofire or less success
fullyâa school teacher, a corn doctor,
a book agent, a novelist, an employ
ment agent, and the founder and head
of a bureau for the suppression of pro
fanity in college football. There were
two or three other callings which he
graced, but we mention only those to
which he stuck for at least two
months. In his present industrial in

him, placed where they would do the
most good.
From the talk I learned that he and
his hack had been mixed up in an ab

Surely it is the better way to scatter
sunshine as one goes along, but there
is a decided knack in knowing just how
and when to scatter It. Many and
many a well-meant kindness is a mis

harm than good. For instance, there is

too, of gotng to "cheer up the family."

many, many times the advance agent
of kindness and tenderness. It really
ish'.t the big things of life that count
so much as It Is the little, every-day
happenings. The big sorrows are so
overwhelming and so great that one
usually manages to rise above them,

soul and cause the pleasure of the day
to-be marred.

more cheer. The girl who has certain

It certainly is not pleasant to have
one of the family pull nearly ex'ery hair

a shampoo, but on the other hand, it is
not an etpeclelly enjoyable task in the

who said:
"If there's one thing I simply cannot

small."
Priscilla having given vent to her
pentup feelings, knitted vigorously on
the slippers she was fashioning for
future gifts. Down the street the fig
ure of a woman was slowly disappear
ing, trolleyward.
Priscilla lifted her eyes Just as the
woman was turning the corner.
"That woman!" she said. "I wouldn't
blame her poor, dear, old husband a
mite if he should elope. No, I
wouldn't."
She turned at this moment to observe
Jack and Dorcas standing in the door
way of the little den, both laughing
heartily.
"Oh, yes, you can both stand there
and laugh, but it was beastly to run
off and leave me with her. Dear knows
what she'll have to tell her husband
this time. Probably that John Lambert
had better pay more attention to his
wife than to that handsome girl who
Is always around."
"Hear! Hear!" cried Jack, doubling
up with merriment- "Isn't she in a
lovely passion!"
"Now. Pris, dear, just cool off a bit,
before you begin ill-treating you*r hus
band. I should think you would be
eternally thankful to me for saving him
from losing his respect for good Mrs.
Black."
"Of course, speaking seriously, I'm
grateful that neither of you were in
flicted with her. But it is unreasonable
to expect me to keep my temper as
long as she was here. She is the most
tactless creature I ever saw. She rub
bers around until she finds out some
thing that I have particularly strong
feelings on, then she takes the antag
onistic view and keeps at it until I
could cry."
"What was It all about this after
noon? I thought she was never going,
and Dorcas insisted that I stay In the
dining-room until she went," and Jack
laughed again at Prise ilia's flushed
face.
"Well, It's a good thing you were out
of earshot She said some things which
I think you would have ordered her out
of the gate for. In fact, I came pretty
near It."
"Out with it, Priscilla, tell us what
she said," and Dorcas brought the
cakes and the tea caddy to the little
table.
"Oh, there's no use going over it all
again. I just happened to remark,
apropos young Mrs. Smithers' divorce,
that I thought it rather bad policy to
bother one's husband with the little
troubles of housekeeping. Well, you
should have teen her take that up and
combat it! My, she really frightened
me. Said that if wives told everything
to their husbands there would be a lot
of trouble saved; that men ought to
know how it was keeping house and
that, the ungrateful brutes, they hadn't
the slightest idea what an amount of
work it was preparing a meal, and how
on earth were they ever to know unless
their wives told them. She declared
that it made a man appreciate his wife
if he knew how hard she worked for
him and she ought to make as much
fuss over little things as she could."
"J hope she didn't succeed in convert
ing you, Prls," and Jack helped himself
to the cakes. "Because, if she did "
"Jack, do you honestly think a wo
man of that type could convert me to
anything?"
"I hope not," and Jack's answer was
fervent.
"You know, both of you, as well as
I do, that'lt is one of my foundation
principles to make as little fuss over
anything as it is possible to make. I
abhor fusses. And as for talking about
my little ones In the
housekeeping line, I meanâl would no
more think of it than I would of fly
ing. Men have troubles enough of
their own. Nine-tenths of the men
realize how much it means to keep
house and appreciate a woman's keep
ing still when things go wrong. Of
course, I talk about some of my
troubles, but what is the use of let
ting my poor friends know that my
laundress is provoking and my grocer
unobliging? It wouldn't do me any
good, and it would only bother them.
Jack does everything he can to shield
me from unpleasant thingsâwhy
shouldn't I reciprocate by keeping
the things that annoy me from him?"
"I don't believe In suffering in si
lence, though," and Dorcas spoke vig
orously.
"Nor I," Priscilla admitted.. "But I
do believe in keeping those little
troubles to oneself and not making the
life of the people about you a bur
den."
"Bravo!" cried Jack. "See how I'
have my wife trained in."
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
"It wasn't you who trained me, silly.
It was my mother. She used to say:
'What is the use of making a fuss over
a little thing like that? It can't be
helped, so just keep still about it.' "
"It's a good rule," Dorcas said, "and
I wish my mother had brought me up
in that way. It's habit more or less, I
suppose, but a habit it is hard to form
after one is grown up."
"You bet it Is," Jack interrupted,
"and hard to break. I really would
rather have Priscilla tell me the things

ANNA (French Dressing).âA French

one tablespoonful of vinegar and three

ordinary barley water, cover four
tablespoonfuls of cleansed gTain with
cold water and let it soak for eight
or ten hours. Stir this into a quart of
cold water, put in a double boiler and
boil steadily for four and a half hours.
Occasionally add a little boiling water,
as the mixture thickens. By the end of
the boiling period it should be re

with hot water or pure milk, as the

purpose. Oak, mahogany or even wal
nut are used, and now and then a
lighter tone, but any should be satis
factory. After straining use a wax or
a shellac as it gives a good, serviceable
finish.
CITY (Rag Rugs).âYes. there Is a
place in this city where rag carpets and
rugs can be made. Rag carpets are
usually made of odds and ends, and
they are very pretty when fashioned of
bright colors. You can use wool or
cotton, or both, Just as you please:
but, of course, the woolen carpets wear
by far the best, and, as a rule, look
much better. One-pound balls are
sewed together, and, I believe, it takes
one and a quarter pounds to make a
yard of carpet.
PUZZLED SCIENCE.âI am not able
to explain the theory of scienoe, but I
know that there is a book called "Sci
ence and Health," and It will In all
probability smooth away your troubles.
Read it two or three times slowly and
deliberately or you may not derive the
desired benefits from It. I cannot give
you the names of any healers through
the medium of this paper, but will
gladly send you a list If you will sup
ply me with your real name and ad
dress.
SEARCHER (Moth Patches).âl am
sorry the peroxide did not bleach your
face sufficiently, but will give you an
other remedy:
Alreate of copper 15 grains
Ointment of oxide of zlnc.% ounce
Rub into the spots morning and
night.
Mind, you, this is for the yellow spots
on your face, and be careful where you
put It. There is but one more recipe
that I can give you, but I might as well
add it to the list. This, however, Is for
moth patches or liver spots, bet If the
other fails, give it a trial:
Kaolin 4 grammes
Lanolin 10 grammes
Glycerin 4 grammes
Carbonate of magnesia. 2 grammes
Oxide of zinc 2 grammes
This should be applied to the spot
before retiring and should remain on
until the next morning. Remove with
the aid of tepid water and a little pure
soap. Repeat the application as often
as necessary.
BLEACH (Peroxide). âNo, peroxide
is anything but a stain. In fact It will
make your hair very fair. There are
many things that will make your hair
a dark brown, but this one is easy
to use: Pyrogallic acid one-quarter
ounce, distilled water (hot) IY4. ounces.
D!ssolve and when the solution has
cooled add gradually rectified spirits
one-quarter (fluid) ounce. This is full
strength and will make your hair al
most black, so dilute it with water un
til you get it from a dark tone to the
one you particularly want.
MRS. J. M. (Pie Crust). âAs you did
not give me your old recipe I am not sure
but that I am giving you one that you
are already familiar with: For a single
pie take two cups of sifted flour, a
half cup of butter, a* small pinch of
salt. Heap two tablespoonfuls of white
sugar (granulated is best), one table
spoonful of lemon juice, two table
spoonfuls of cold water and the yolk
of an egg. Rub the butter, flour, salt
and sugar together until they are
creamy. Then make the yolk of egg,
lemon juice and water into a paste.
Place the whole on a pastry board and
pat with the rolling piii until it Is
flaky and white. Then roll out the
proper size and place in the pie plate.
JESSIE Hair). âThere are
many things that are used to keep
one's hair In curl, but I do not know
of a single one that Is very successful
in wet weather. Try this formula:
Gum arable one dram, sugar one dram,
rose water two ounces. Mix and dis
solve. Moisten the hair in this solu
tion. Put up in curling kids and be
certain to curl the hair the right way,
so that it will look natural.
MERRIE (Theater Frocks). âThe
prettiest, daintiest little frocks are
worn these days at the theater, but
very seldom are they really low. Of
course, grand* opera is different, but
then we are not overly favored In this
direction. White is a great favorite:
pink, blue, tan and red are worn and
all very elaborate. The yoke and
sleeves are fashioned many times of a
heavy lace and the result is splendid.
Short sleeves are worn with every
thing. Street gowns, waists, and, in
deed, all sorts and conditions of frocks
are made with this dainty half sleeve
and long gloves are worn as a matter
of course. The cloak is light broad
cloth or lace and made m a very elab
orate fashion or else the extreme of
simplicity. Champagne Is a good color
to select, for it may be worn In the

Of socialistic literature because of
the writer's deductions; the facts he
sets forth rightly belong to the domain
of industrial economics. And when I
denominate Hunter's book as socialis
tic I do so with a strong qualifying res
ervation; his is the socialism of the
thinker and the student of conditions
and not that of the hare-brained theo
rist and the agitator. As Ruskin was
â  a socialist, as William Morris was an
advocate of like tenets, so is this wri
ter, and the added weight of long
study of conditions carries conviction
with everything that he advances.
Between pauperism and poverty
" Hunter makes a sharp distinction at
thie very outset âa distinction which
acts as the pivotal point of his argu
ments throughout. One is in poverty
when he cannot by labor obtain "those
necessaries which will permit him to
maintain a state of physical efficiency."
A pauper has gone beyond poverty the
minute that he solicits and receives
charity and becomes thereby a depen
dent upon the bounty of society. The
pauper class in any city and in the
country at large can be reckoned ap
proximately; no set of statistics, how
ever, is complete enough to register the
number of that larger class, the class
in poverty, whose several members
may struggle along just below the
mean line of physical efficiency and
postpone for a time the dread scourge
of pauperism. England and Germany,
says the writer, have awakened to the
stern necessity of obtaining data upon
the constantly Increasing army of the
poverty stricken and the helplessly
poor, but the United States is abso
lutely without the machinery of census
gathering which returns statistics upon
this vital question of industrialism.
From fragments of information such as
the evictions from lodgings, the record
"of burials in the potters' field, the death
rate from tuberculosis In the tene
ments, the roll of the unemployed, etc..
Hunter has made a conservative esti
mate of poverty and pauperism based
upon these incomplete sources. Not less
than 14 per cent of the people in pros
perous times and not less than 20 per
cent In bad times are in a state of pov
erty; the actual dependents upon char
ity approximate 4,000,000.
Continuing with his evidences of
the wide extent of poverty In this
country, the writer touches upon some
of the fundamental causes of Its ex
istence. Lack of employment, un
steady employment, the intense com
petition in laborâthese things serve
to make uncertain even the barely ef
ficient wage of the laborer. The ac
cidents, casualties and diseases result
ing from industrial employments;
these are other fruitful sources of the
scourge of penury. The possession of
property Is a reserve force to the
worker; yet the last census figures
show that considerably over one-half
of the families In the United States
do not own the houses they live in
and that 80 per cent of the workers in
cities are properlyless. Furthermore,
according to the same census, seven
eighths of the families hold but one
eighth of the national wealth.
These are some of the author's
facts; what are his deductions? Most
men are brought to povertx by the
wrongs of society; some by tneir own
faults. This is socialism, simon pure;
but what are the author's suggested
remedies? Not the overthrow of so
ciety, not the equal division of wealth.
"The factories, the mines, the work
shops and the railroads must be
forced to cease from killing the fath
er or the boy or the girl whose wages
alone suffice to keep the family from
poverty." Again: "Tenements may be
made sanitary by the action of the
community, and thereby much of this
breeding of wretched souls and ruined
bodies stopped." This remedy also: "A
broader education may be provided
for the masses, so that the street child
may be saved from idleness, crime and
vagrancy, and the working child saved
from ruinous labor."
There Is nothing inflammatory or ex
treme in these views; in fact the pa
ternalism of the German Government
is already making- some very near ap
proaches to the ideals of industrial
conditions which the author upholds.
The wrong of society lies not in the
mere possession of money but in the
methods of acquiring it. "You can kill
a man with a tenement Just as easily
as you can kill him with an ax," says
Jacob Riis in "How the Other Half
Lives." The man who owns a deadly
tenement, then, is, according to Riis'
view and the author's, a murderer; the
railroad director who reruses to vote
for the "unwarranted expense" of a
block system commits a crime against
ail of the employes on his lines.
Under the conditions of poverty as
they exist to-day special hardship is
wrought against the sick and the
maimed, the aged and the children.
In separate chapters devoted to "The
Pauper." "The Sick" and "The Child"
Hunter ahows how out of joint modern
Eocial conditions are with the spirit of
fairness and justice. Especially does
he inveigh against the employment of
one of tender years in industries which
choke out of him all the normal springs
Of growth and development and make
him a mere machine, rattling with
wear before even adult years are
Teached. In a chapter devoted to the
iffect of immigration upon the industrial
conditions of America the author calls
attention to the evil results of immi
gration artificially stimulated by
steamship agents for the sake of gain.
In brief summary and comment upon
"Poverty" it may be said that the
author has not sought to" outline reme
dies so much as to state clearly the
problem which calls for immediate
attention. With the exception' of John
Graham Brooks' book, "The Social Un
rest," I can recall no work of recent
years that puts conditions and states
facts so convincingly as does this study
of Hunter's. As to the remedies he
puts forth, those are, as I have said,
in the domain of socialism, and on that
mooted question I have neither the
ability nor the daring to venture opin-

THE HAGUE
and Arbitration
r\ T the instance of the Mohonk Ar
bitration Conference John W.
J 1 Foster, ex-Secretary of State
f and president of the National Ar-
bitration Conference, has writ
ten a monograph upon "Arbitration
and The Hague Court," which sums
up in a concise fashion the results of
The Hague Peace Conference of 1899
and sets forth the present achieve
ments and future aims of the world's
peace party. At the present time when
arbitration treaties between the United
States and two other nations are pend
ing the confirmation of the Senate and
when President Roosevelt is awaiting
the answers of the powers to his call
for a second peace conference Foster's
book has a significance which demands
wide reading.
The writer's review of the session of
the first peace conference is brief but
comprehensive. He shows how the
very involved nature of the proposed
disarmament of the nations was in it
self sufficient cause for the failure of
the measure to win the undivided sanc
tion of the powers signatory to the
convention and declares that the ex
pression of a reduction of armaments
as an ideal to be held before the na
tions, such as that incorporated in the
convention by the delegates to the con
ference, was in itself something gained;
indeed the only thing that could be
gained at the time. In the work of the
International assemblage which result
ed In the arbitration convention and
the establishment of the permanent
court for the arbitrament of interna
tional differences Mr. Foster finds,
however, sufficient reason for proclaim
ing The Hague conference the first ef
fective step in the direction of uni
versal peace.
Mr. Foster believes that in the near
future the failure of the arbitration
convention evolved at The Hague to
Incorporate in its provisions the en-'
forcement of compulsory arbitration
will be remedied. The nearest ap
proach to this measure made by the
convention is that clause which re
serves to the powers signatory the
right to conclude general or special
agreements extending the obligation to
submit controversies to arbitration be
fore the bar of The Hague Court In all
cases mutually agreed upon. Under
this clause Great Britain and France
first set the initiative by concluding a
treaty agreement stipulating that the
contracting parties shall submit to the
permanent' court of arbitration dif
ferences of a judicial o,rder or relative
to the interpretation of existing trea
ties, providing that such differences do
not concern "the vital interests, nor
the Independence or honor of the two
contracting states." But, as Foster
shows, this proviso clause anent
the vital interests, honor and
independence of the parties to
the treaty leaves room for
great elasticity of application and Is
to be deprecated. Treaties since rati
fied between Holland and Denmark
and Chile and Argentina, which agree
to submit all disputes to The Hague
Court, reserving only those concerned
with the Independence of one or both
of the contracting parties, are to the
mind of the author much more in ac
cordance with the spirit of internation
al arbitration and point the way for a
more liberal reading of the doctrine of â¢
peace.
In conclusion the writer of this mono,
graph cites the instances already on
record of the efficiency of The Hague
Court and calls for the hearty co
operation of every individual in sup
port of the sentiment which created it
and which must continue to sustain
and amplify Its beneficent jurisdiction.
Despite the terrible contradiction of
the spirit of International amity
which is now displaying itself In
the war drama of the Far East, Foster
has every reason to uphold an abiding
trust In the ultimate triumph of peace
policies, achieved through the opera
tion of the tribunal of International
arbitration at The Hague.

PHILLIPS'
"The Sin of David"
STEPHEN PHILLIPS' new reading
play, "The Sin of David," must, I
believe, elicit commendation not
altogether unqualified. As poetry
"The Sin of David" is a thing rarely
beautiful; as drama it is weak and
lacking in convincing strength. Though
some of the poet's lines sing themselves
deep into the very heart of hearts of
the reader, and though the delicate, al
most exotic, grace of his verse carries
with it the charm of the highest ar
tistry, the ultimate effect of the whole
drama is that of disillusion and dissat
isfaction. Can we but consider it in
detail we are ready to concede Phillips'
last play the greatest .praise; in its
whole substance it wants something,
which is felt insensibly by the reader
but which sticks at exact definition.
One cause of this deficiency in Phil
lips' drama is more readily appreciated
than the other and finer objections that
may be raised against it, and this
cause springs from the poet's too earn
est desire for simplicity in the piece's
action. The fable of the guilty love be
tween David and Bathsheba, the wife
of Uriah the Hittite, which Phillips has
transversed to English scenes and char
acters, certainly admits of a deeper,
more slow-moving and more significant
development than that received from
the hand of this poet. Three actsâand
they are briefâhave been forced to en
compass action which has to rehearse
a Tristan and Isolde theme plus the
added compjication of this Roundhead
David's treachery in setting his Uriah
"in the forefront of the hottest battle"
and thereby bringing death to him. To
such an extent has Phillips trimmed
down and lopped off the angles of his
action that the passion between the
spotless wife and the irreproachably
leader of God's hosts has to germinate,
spring into life and blush at greatest
heat all before the climax to the sec
ond act has been reached. The neces
sary result of this severe abridgment
in the action 4s a bewilderment to the
reader, however close in sympathy he
may be with the story that inspires the
drama.
Another objection, this one a matter
of motive, raises itself against "The
Sin of David." After the guilty lovers
have become united before the law
upon the removal of the one having
right to a just grievance against them
the child of their sinful passion Is
snatched away by death. Divine pun
ishment in this case seems not to be a
punishment, but a sanctiflcation. Thus
sounds the final note of the drama in
the words of the bereaved father:
Our former marriage, though by holy bell
And melody of lifted voices blest.
Was jet in madness of the blood conceived.
And born of murder; therefore la the child
Withdrawn that we might feel the sting of
flesh
Corruptible; yet he In that withdrawal,
tolded upon the bosom of the Father.
Hath joined us In a. marriage everlasting:
Marriage at last of spirit, not of sense,
\\ hose ritual Is memory and repentance
Whose Facrament this deep and mutual wound.
Whose covenant the all that might have been.
And to this truth majestic shadows throng
And stand about us in dumb sympathy.
In presence of these silent witnesses
And one perchance that carrleth now a babe.
1v,% ? mine thy hand anil call thee wifeâ
wire, wife, till the grave-shattering trumpet!
But as poetry Phillips' play is uni
formly one of surpassing excellence.
Spontaneity is not a characteristic of
Phillips' verse. It does not move
through motive springs within, ft Is
not temperamental. It Is, however,
classical without being artificial; per
fect, though not studied. An excerpt
from the love scene between Lisle and
Miriam exhibits Phillips at his very
highest:
When I spurred hither, all on Are for God.
Then did I gallop into human flame.
tÂ«lu I had lived, pure, narrow, temperate
A. girded swordsman pressing to the mark.
6 E th f,Â° ,J S h that gate. Then suddenly
Thy beauty like a tempest fell on me:
And in one moment was I rent and riven.
Stunned Is my life; I wander, and I grope,

This lifted arm falls at thy floating face.

MISSIONS
of Old California
BRYAN J. CLINCH, a well-known
local writer upon subjects of re
ligious history, has Just published
"California and Its Missions," a
historical review' of the religious and
secular history of the'two Californias
in two volumes. In scope Mr, Clinch's
work Is of the broadest. It reviews in
detail the spread of the temporal power
over Mexico and Alta California from
the conquests of Cortes down to the
change of government at the end of the
Mexican War, at the same time keeping
record of the foundation and growth of
the spiritual empire of the church un
der the mission building padres. More
than several other of the historians has
this writer recognized the Indissoluble
bond between the religious and the sec
ular history of early California, and In
his work he has made the co-ordination
between the two forces emphatic. This
and the additional fact that In volume
his book is a happy mean between the
ponderosity of Bancroft and the con
densed handbooks, such as that of
Royce, make Clinch's "California and
Its Missions" a book of more than fleet
ing value.
A reading of the first volume, devoted
to the history of missions and mission
work in Mexico and Baja California,
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALIi
convinces the reader that Clinch has
done wisely in incorporating these rec
ords in a book devoted to the study of
mission development upon the Western
coast. The author's chapter upon "The
Evolution of the Spanish Mission Sys
tem" deals with the efforts of Las
Casas, the father of Mexican missic-ne,
to free Spanish conquest from tne
brutal and degrading features of slav
ery and wanton butchery and to make
conversion a matter of persuasion
rather than of compulsion. To this pio
neer Jesuit, whose field of endeavor ex
tended from Venezuela to the Colorado
and whose service covered nearly a
half-century, the author devotes atten
tion usually withheld by other writers.
In discussing: the expulsion of the
Jesuit order |rom ,Spain and the Span
ish domain the writer takes exception
to the explanations of Hittell and Tut
hill on the score of their inadequacy,
this without reason, as It seems to me,
for all historians agree that the reason
Charles 111 may have had for causing
the expulsion of the Jesuits remained
forever a secret with himself and his
confidential Ministers. The two quota
tions from the Spanish King's lips
whioh Clinch gives do not diffuse any
new light on the mystery.
In discussing the Franciscans' meth
ods of Indian control and mission dis
cipline the author of this work shows
strong pro-padre prejudices, if such a
term may pass current. Against the
majority of the authority, which holds
that the rule of the mission fathers
was despotic though beneficial to the
native Californians, Clinch takes his
stand immovably. Claiming that the
priest who lodged charges of cruelty
and despotic rule against Father La
suen, president of the missions, was in
sane, the author continues to show that
the Franciscan rule was naught but the
most paternal. In this he proves his
assertions by citing results only, and
leaves unexplained the various un
biased reports of strangers who had
occasion to visit the missions.

GLIMPSES
at Great People
ff\ R. HENRY HAYNIE. now a
111 man well in his prime, occu
-I*l Pled for many years that envied
r \ goal of most newspaper men, a
European correspondency, and
during the time he spent upon the Con
tinent as representative of several
large New York papers he necessarily
had occasion to rub shoulders with
kings, princes and diplomats, musi
cians, artists and notables of every
walk In life. He cultivated the ac
quaintance of some, he Bought the fa
vor of all, and as a result he came Into
intimate knowledge of the idiosyncra
sies and personal traits of many whom
the world calls great and of many oth
ers whom the world has Cenominated
as "freaks." Drawing upon this rich
fund of experience, Mr. Haynie, now in
retirement, has written a book, "The
Captains and the Kings," which is de
signed to give his intimate reminis
cences of notabilities and which satis
fies fully our inborn curiosity concern
ing those whose heads rise above the
common throng.
Mr. Haynie first engaged In the dif
ficult but fascinating work of culling
the world's news from court and coun
cil chamber in 1875. After undergoing
the solemn ceremony of being present
ed at the court of Victoria he took up
his residence in Paris and. using that
city as a headquarters, he made Eu
rope the â¢field of his "assignments"âto
use a newspaper termâfor twenty
years. Paris, then swirling in the last
declining glory of the lately defunct
Second Empire, was the nesting-place
and pleasure ground for destitute
princelings and deposed monarchs.
There Haynie met Isabella, the ex-
Queen of Spain, and her weakling con
sort, Don Francis. Dom Pedro, the ill
fated ex-Emperor of Brasil, was then
living in simple retirement In the
French capital. Prince Jerome, whom
the author justly calls the very last of
the authentic representatives of the old
Bonapartist regime, was making his
somewhat blundering: presence known
in the councils of Napoleon 111. All of
these little shadows of royalty are
given a brief sketch, based upon the
author's observation and in some In
stances his personal acquaintance-
To Boulanger, the famous charlatan,
who came so dangerously near to up
setting the present republic in France,
Haynie devotes a comprehensive char
acter sketch. "Often ridiculous, yet al
ways Interesting," says the writer, "he
was a strange composition of all the
conflicting ambitions of those opposed
to the French republic. Knowing how
to talk buncombe, how to get Into the
newspapers, how to ride pompously on
bis' famous black charger, Boulanger
became noÂ£ only the hope of theories
and barricades, but the ally of aristo
crats and the tool of royalists." Henri
Rochefort, the one-time champion of
Boulanger, and always the most vitu
perative and fanatical of French Jour
nalists, is characterized by Haynie as
presenting "the lamentable spectacle
of a man of adventures, the apostle of
an Idea without any idea of his own."
Not one of the least interesting men
with whom this American correspond
ent had the pleasure of a close ac
quaintance was the late M. de Blowitz,
"king of news gatherers" as the author
dubs him. Haynie once had the oppor
tunity to throw a big news "scoop"
into the Dath of this remarkable jour
nalist and In so doing had an oppor
tunity to study the methods of the man
at first hand. Here was one who could
not only get the news of an empire
or a republic's secret negotiations first,
but could often predict with remark
able accuracy Just where the marble
would land In the diplomatic game of
roulette. Prince Bismarck once de
clared to Havnie that De Blowitz and
De Blowitz alone of all the correspond
ents could he trust.
The author of "The Captains and tht
Kings" did not confine his acquaintance
to the circles of the state affairs. With
Ernest Renan he was on intimate
terms; Victorien Sardou freely dis
cussed with him his ideas on the
drama; he was once privileged to hear
Gounod play and sing a selection from
"The Marriage of Figaro" in the musi
cian's own private cabinet; the studios
of Gerome, Meissonier and Breton were
always open to him. Haynie tells a
story of how Ambroise Thomas, the
Immortal creator of Mignon, after hav
ing returned to his house on the out- .
skirts of Paris from the disastrous war
with Prussia, found his house and his
alone inviolate among all of those
looted by the victorious Germans. He
discovered upon his library table the
card of thÂ« Prussian officer who had
been quartered there, bearing upon it
the written expression of that gentle
man's homage to the man who had
given to the world the little Bohemian
girl of the exquisite opera.

COOKS
and Wedded Joys
DALE, the well-known New
York dramatic critic, may be giv
|l ing us a faithful excerpt from his
* own domestic history,-or he may
be yielding to farcical fancy, in his
book, "Wanted: A Cook." If this is In
very truth a transcript from life the
deepest sympathies of all wretched
householders go out to Alan Dale, for
he is one of the great army of latter
day martyrs who pass almost monthly
through the fiery furnace of "the help
question," not unscathed as Shadrach,
Meshach and Abed-nego.
The critic's naratlve recites the ad
ventures of a newly wedded couple,
possessed of fine pre-Raphaelite deli
cacy of sentiment, who fondly believe
that they can begin life in a cosy little
flat without even a thought to the mun
dane things of the culinary department.
Their disillusionment is sudden and
disastrous. The first cook lady whom
they employ Is an ebony jewel, how
belt rough cut. She sets out a delicates
sen dinner of pickles and potato salad
because she must not be late to her
meeting of the choral society. The sec
ond is a dipsomaniac with a penchant
A * V. . , . J
for the mistress' jewels andXlne linen.
The third is a respectable widow
with a child, whose single accomplish
ment is the power to say "Ga-ga" at
all times and in all places. But why
continue the list? the assortment Is
known of every housewife, and there
are six of them all told before peace
folds Its wings over the dovecote of the
newly wedded.
Alan Dale's book is humorousâde
lightfully so. -The situations he con
jures up are not new ones to the funny
papers, but they are outlined with such
wild abandon of mirth that the reader
must be of Scotch-English extraction
if he Is not moved to hilarious appre
ciation.

PLANS
of the Magazines
111 year the periodicals have pro-
VA/ claimed with more or less de
gree of self-satisfaction what
they wish to promise readers In the
coming twelvemonth. Enterprising
editors have forwarded to the review
ers itemized menus of the literary
feast which they guarantee to set be
fore the hungry public, and from these
the following notes have been culled:
Harper's promises something a bit
out of the rut In the two series of arti
cles for the coming year, in which
Henry James will write about his "re
discovered" America, and William D.
Howells about fresh impressions of
England. Thomas A. Janvier will write
about Mexico, Charles W. Furlong
about North Africa, James B. Connolly
about great American harbors and riv
ers, and Charjes J. Post about South
America. There will be more special
articles on American diplomacy by
John Bassett Moore, papers on cap
tains of Industry of the past, accounts
by Charles F. Thwlng of little-known
European schools, and articles on
American soldiers of fortune and on
famous statesmen who have been "rul
ers of kings." The slave trade of to
day (still current in Central Africa)
will be the subject of papers, data for
which are now being collected by an
English war correspondent sent to the
Dark Continent for the purpose.
At the top of The Century's list of at
tractions of the more Solid sort for the
next year stand the papers In which
Andrew D. White will tell about his
mission as Embassador to Germany
from 1897 .to 1902. In fiction the pro
gramme calls for a serial story by
Alice Hegan Rice; a novelette by Mrs.
Humphry Ward; another novelette,
"Rose o' the River," by Kate Douglas
Wiggin, and a sea yarn, "Under Rock
ing Skies," by Frank L. Tooker. Short
stories, of course, are many and good,
most of the stock story tellers being
represented In the list. We may name
at random Kipling, Hope, London.
Owen Wister, Eden Phillpotts, Myra
Kelly, Gbuverneur Morris, Miriam
Michelson, Charles B. Loomis and
Julian Hawthorne. A series of arti
cles of no small interest will be "Great
Inventions Described by Their Inven
tors," the writers including Charles F.
Brush, George Westinghouse and Niko
la Tesla.
Selections from th* diaries and let
ters of George Bancroft, the historian,
v will be the leading feature of Scribner's
for the new year. A new series of let
ters by Mme. Waddington will deal
with life in Italy, and the war in the
Far East will be the subject of papers
by John Fox Jr. and Thomas F. Mil
lard, who have represented the maga
zine at the seat of the trouble on the
Japanese and Russian sides, respec
tively. Other Interesting matter will
be Frank A. Vanderllp's articles on
European political questions of inter
est to America, and the articles on the
Paris workingman by Walter A. Wyck
off, who has been investigating his
subject in person. Both of these series
were delaved from the current year.
Among illustrated special articles may
be named several by John Corbln on
the drama and American playgoers, a
paper on the French landscape gar
dener Le Notre, and a study of a South
American republic by A. R Colquhoun.
Then, not least important of all the
magazine's offerings will be Edith
Wharton's new novel, "The House of
Mirth," which will run from January
to the end of the year.
McClure's will proceed ror the new
year with Its contributions to contem
porary American history on the finan
cial, political and social sldea Miss Ida
M. Tar bell wfll write aoout John D.
Rockefeller as a man; Lincoln Steffens
will tell about graft and kindred mat
ters in Rhode Isand (the Rev. Andrew
Bumaby found grafters in that tight
little province ten years before the
Revolution); Ray Stannard Baker will
continue his papers on "Great Labor
Conflicts," with especial reference to
American lawlessness; Samuel Adams
will discuss problems of public health
and Booth Tarkington will write a se
ries of political stories. Yet another
important feature will be the story of
the As tor fortune. George E. Wood
berry will write about "Great Masters
of Literature," and John La Farga will
continue his papers on the "On* Hun
dred Masterpieces of Painting." An
other contributor will be the Rev.
Charles Wagner, author of "ThÂ« Simple
Life," and there will be stories by
George Madden Martin, Stewart Ed
ward White, Jack London, Mary Ray-
mond Shipman Andrews, Norman Dun
can, Josephine D ask am Bacon, Henry
Wallace Phillips, James Hopper and
others. Myra Kelley will write In a
new vein. There will be pictures In
color every month, and of a long list
of Illustrators may be named Andre
Castalgne. Max field Parrish, Jessie
Wilcox Smith, Alice Barber Stevens,
Fanny Y. Cory, Fogarty, Frost, Ster
ner, Glackens and Guerln.
Without giving titles or names of
authors, Llpplncott's promises for the
new year everything that Its readers
have learned to expectâand more.
Since the librarians of circulating libra
ries report that 70 per cent of all books
taken out by their clients are novels,
Lippincott's will continue its pro
gramme of a complete novel In each
number, designed for relaxation, not
for instruction or propaganda They
promise, too, to fill out each month with
short stories that "snap with freshness
and originality," with poems for many
tastes, with things to make the reader
laugh. In other words, the undertak
ing is to follow the established lines of
the magazine, and do It all better than
ever.
Mary Austin's old California ro
mance, "Isodro," which is now run
ning in The Atlantic Monthly, will
continue till March, when it will be
followed by "The Coming of the
Tide," a serial by Margaret Sherwood.
Another extract from Emerson's
"Journal" is promised; Colonel T. W.
Higginson will write more "Literary
Reminiscences," the papers on "The
Ethics of Business:' will continue, and
Andrew D. White's history of "The
Welfare of Humanity Against Eccle
siasticism" has more chapters to come.
Again, there will be many Installments
of that remarkable "find," Thoreau's
private Journal (of thirty-nine manu

Rider Haggard, the author of "The
Brethren," is much more than a writer
of stories, though the world has known
him for the last dozen years only as
such. Back in the '70s he was a big man
in South Africaâmaster of the High
Court of the Transvaal, and the man
who, with Colonel Brooke, hoisted the
British flag over the South African re
public. He was a mighty hunter In his
South African days, and many of the
shooting adventures so excitingly set
out In his novels are written directly
from actual happenings. It was in the
'80s and '90s that he began to produce
his famous novels, In 1901 he took up
his investigation of the condition of
agriculture in England, and is now
noted for his tireless work in the best
interests of the British farmer.
The Variorum edition of the works
of Beaumont and Fletcher Is to be

LIST INCLUDES
DUKES, EARLS
AND DUCHESSES
SEVERAL BOOKSBT THE WOMEN
Their Graces of Sutherland
and Leeds Excel at the
Present Time.
LONDON, Jan. 7.âWhen Queen Vic
toria wrote and published those two
unassuming works, "Leaves From a
Highland Journal" and "More Leaves,"
she had no idea what a remarkable ef
fect her example would have. Prob
ably it never entered her royal head
that titled folk of every rank on this
side of the water would take the tip
from her and that after a while it
would be an uneventful week that did
rot produce a novel, a book of poems,
or at least a magazine article by one of
them.
That's the state of things at present.
â¢ however. There appeared recentlyâall
within a few days of each otherâa
novel by the Earl of Iddesleigh, a his
torical work by the Countess of War
wick, and a collection of poems edited
by the Duchess of Sutherland. And
within the past week there have been
announcements to the effect that Lady
Jeune is writing a society novel, that
Lord Ellesmere is doing the same, that
Lady Colin Campbell is hard at work
on an emotional play, and that Lady
Betty Balfour is collaborating on a
comedy wifh Mrs. Alfred Lyttelton,
wife of the Colonial Secretary.
STARTED BY VICTORIA.
It is all Queen Victoria's fault. Up
to about twenty years ago, although
members of the peerage frequently pat
ronized men of letters, they made no
attempt to shine in the literary firma
ment themselves. Women of title, es
pecially, let the business of authorship
severely alone. Count D'Orsay's fair
f>i*md. the Countess of Blessington,
\vas an exception, it is true, but she
was always more or less of an "out
sider." In fact, so far as can be re
membered, up to the time mentioned
the one and only work of any im
portance published by an English
woman of high rank was that rather
grewsome novel. "Ellen Middleton,"
written by Lady Georgiana Fullerton,
sister of the famous Lord Granvilleâ
and it appeared anonymously.
Almost immediately after the ap
pearance of Queen Victoria's book,
however, a number of women belonging
to the court world followed her exam
ple by giving to the world portions of
â¢their distinguished diaries and amiably
written accounts of their travels, and
after a walls two or three members of
â¢ the peerage, both men and women,
came out boldly with novels. Others
tried their hands at poetry, and still
others had a go at writing for the
stage, and of late years the thing has
become so much the fashion that the
list of titled scribblers includes one
Duke, three Duchesses, four Countesses,
five Earls and plain lords and ladies by
the dozen.
DUCHESSES AS WRITERS.
Frankly, thf Thames has yet to be
set on fire as the result of a work by
any member of this illustrious aggrega
tion. But if the literary, poetic and
dramatic work produced thus far by
British titled folk isn't on the whole so
very good, it Isn't s<> very bad, either,
and there are perhaps a half-dozen
men and women of title among the
numhcr who have no < mall share of the
real stuff of which successful! writers
are made.
First and foremost among these
comes the yqungest of the three Duch
esses mentionedâher Grace of Suther
land. She was the eldest daughter of
the fourth Earl of Rosslyn. and is a
sister of the present erratic bearer of
that title, who also has had a shy at
. literature and likewise at acting, but
who is perhaps best known as one of
the men who didn't "break the bank at
Monte Carlo." The Duchess of Suther
land is distinguished In a number of
ways. She is a beautiful woman, and
since her marriage has dispensed hos
pitality at what is called the finest pri
vate residence in the world. She has
done a lot of really important social
work, too, and her widespread philan
thropy has earned her the title of the
"Charity Duchess."
Her first book was called "How I
Spent My Twentieth Year," and was
quite an original little piece of work,
though of no great strength. Not till
ten years laterâthe Duchess is now 33 â
did she publish anything else of any
importance, but then her novel. "One
Hour and the Next." came out and was
immediately recognized as a serious
and thoughtful book and one to be
reckoned with.
TELL OF HUMBLE LIFE.
The Duchess of Leeds is another
Englishwoman of title who has real
literary ability. Unfortunately her
health is extremely delicate, a fact
which has prevented her from doing
any great quantity of writing. She is a
daughter of the late Earl of Durham,
was one of a rather remarkable family
of thirteen brothers and sisters and is
married to one of the greatest of Eng
lish nobles. The Duke of Leeds is a
descendant of Charles IPs famous Min
ister and he owns 24,800 acres.
The Duchess' first Important literary
work was a novel called "A Lover of
! THE Jlf CALL
the Beautiful." It scored a distinct suc
cess and gave the impression that even
better work might be expected from its
author âan impression that was fully
confirmed by the Duchess* next w-ork, a
volume of short stories with the odd
title "Capriccios." Strangely enough,
most of these were stories of humble
life, it being a singular fact that al
most none of the women of title who
are writing fiction to-day has dealt with
the fashionable life which they really
know best.
The Duchess of Leeds has another
novel under way. She invariably spends
the winter on the Riviera, and she left
the other day for her villa at Bordig
hera.
The other literary Duchess, her Grace
of Devonshire, is only so to a limited
extent, for her work with the pen has
been confined to the editing of certain
letters written by the loveliest of her
predecessors, which were published in
Lady Randolph Churchill's Anglo-Sax
on Review.
ENGLAND'S LITERARY DUKE.
England's literary Duke is one of the
most exalted personages in the king
dom. For his Grace of Argyll, besides
being the author of a number of serious
works, many tales and poems, and an
opera libretto, is closely related to the
royal family by virtue of having mar
ried Princess Louise, own sister of
King Edward VII. His most success
ful work was "The United States of
America After the War."
The most prolific writer of the four
English Countesses is Lady Jersey.
Most of her literary work has been in
the way of Juvenile literature. Her
"Hymns for Very Little Children" â
two series of themâwere published be
fore her marriage, since when she has
written "Sleeping Beauty, a Play for
Children," "Maurice or the Red Jar."
The beautiful Countess of Warwick
has an uncommon gift for writing, but
her many other activities have pre
vented her from writing books to any
extent and her only published works,
exclusive of numberless magazine ar
ticles, are her "History of Warwick
Castle and Its Earls" and "Reminis
cences of Joseph Arch."
The other literary Countesses are
those of Cromartie and Pembroke, the
first of whom recently published a vol
ume of short stories called "The End
of the Song." The Countess of Pem
broke, who is a sister of the Duchess
of Leeds, is represented by only one
workâan account of Wilton House, her
husband's splendid place near Salis
bury, which is famous for its literary
associations. There Sir Phillip Sidney
wrote his "Arcadia," and near by. on
the banks of the river Nadder, Izaak
Walton composed his "Complete
Angler."
A GIFTED NOBLEMAN.
After the Duke of Argyll, the Earl
of Iddesleigh, whose latest novel has
just made its appearance, is perhaps
the most gifted of English noblemen
who write. That is not sayinsr much,
however, for the male members of the
peerage who have gone in for literature
have done so much less successfulv
on the whole than their feminine col
leagues. The Earl of Iddesleijrh's nov
els are not half bad. and so far each
one of them has been better than its
predecessor. His lordship's father, who
was leader of the House of Commons
under Disraeli, was a great book man.
and he and Disraeli used to have fierce
arguments as to the merits of Charles
Dickens, of whom Gladstone's exeat
rival could say nothing good.
There is also the Earl of Ellesmere.
who has published half a dozen novels
or more, the best known of which is
called "Sir Hector's Watch."
FRENCH TO GIVE SWORD
/ TO GENERAL. STOESSEL
Fund Raised for Purpose of Honoring
the Defender of Port
Arthur.
PARIS, Jan. 7.âThe subscription list
of the Echo de Paris in favor of giving
a sword of honor to General Stoessei,
the heroic defender of Port Arthur, is
growing apace and will, before many
days, reach the figure of at least $5000.
This is the kind of thing that the
French like to give money for and if
only the gallant officer can find his
v ay in happier days to Paris the town
would go wild over the pleasure of
presenting the gift, so to speak-, in per
son.
The sword will be designed by one of
the greatest French artists and will be
inscribed with the names of a score
of the first citizens of the republic.
Among the heavy subscribers are some
of the most prominent men In France
in all walks of lifeâpolitical, social and
literary. When the sum subscribed
reaches $6000 the list will be stopped, as
this sum is considered sufficient to pur
chase the finest sword that French art
and workmanship can produce. It is
several times as much as was sub
scribed for the famous sword of honor
given to Colonel Marchand.
LITERARY DUCHESS AND A PRINCE IN THE ADMIRALTY WITH WIFE WHO ASSISTED HIM.
BRITISH NAVAL NEWS
COMES FROM AMERICA
London Office Conceals Facts
LONDON, Jan. 7.âUnder the pres
sure of public opinion and the influence
of such men as Admiral Sir John Fish
er anf Lord Charles Beresford, the
Admiralty isÂ«" doing harder and better
work than it has ever done before. But
its organization continues much the
same as that which in the past has
frequently allowed the British navy to
lapse into a deplorable condition of in
efficiency. Its constitution affords no
guarantee that it will not do the same
thing again when public vigilance is
relaxed or its personnel is changed.
The Admiralty is controlled by a
board.
"Boards." says Sidney Smith, "are
only meant to act as a screen"âa
screen to conceal from the public what
goes on within the Admiralty, for
which the British people are now pay
ing neariy $1,500,000 annually in salaries
to heads of departments, minor officials
and clerks. It is based on negation of
direct responsibilityâthe very principle
which is found essential to the suc
cessful management of any business
enterprise.
At its head is a Cabinet Minister,
with the official title of First Lord of
the Admiralty.
The present holder of the office is
Lord Selborne, who had the good for
tune twenty-one years ago to marry a
daughter of the late Marquis of Sails
bury and thus attached himself to the
house of Cecil, whose members the
Marquis always did his best to provide
with snug political billets. However,
Lord Seaborne is reputed to be a con
scientious, fairly capable and energetic
man.
The other members of the board com
prise four naval officers of high rank,
known, respectively, as the senior, sec
ond, third and junior naval lords; a
civil lord and a parliamentary and
financial secretary. For some un
known reason the third naval lord,
who is known also as the controller,
gets the biggest salaryâsÃsoo a year,
in addition to his professional pay.
A matter on which naval reformers
are all agreed Is that the naval lords
should" be ho" longer muzzledâthat the
SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, JANUARY S, 1905.
men who are best qualified to report on
the condition and requirements of the
navy should be allowed to do so, com
pelled to do so, in fact. At present the
nation is in the main dependent for
official Information of this sort on the
utterances of the politicians' of the
board.
It is a fact, incredible though it may
seeem. that at Washington, from the
reports of the Naval Intelligence
Bureau, more accurate and detailed in
formation can be obtained about the
British navyâthe ships and the guns
and everything else connected with it
âthan even a member of the House of
Commons can procure from the Brit
ish Admiralty. The foreign naval
attache easily gets the information
that is denied the British taxpayer.
In his book on "Naval Administra
tion" Sir John H. Briggs, who was for
many years chief clerk of the Ad
miralty, and therefore knew all about
it, says: "My official experience justi
fies me in stating that nothing is so
difficult to obtain as really accurate in
formation; the country never gets it,
the House of Commons very seldom,
and it is doubtful if the Prime Minister
himself is honestly furnished with what
he requires."
It tr typically indicative of the slow
ness with which the British Admiralty
adapts its organization to modern re
quirements that the Naval Intelligence
and Mobilization Departmentâa most
important one âwas created only
eighteen years ago.
His serene Highness, Prince Louis of
Battenberg, has been at the head* of
it since 1902. His.salary is $7500 a year.
Singular to relate, he is generally
credited with earning it, too, for al
though a Prince he is really a compe
tent and hard working officer. But he
would never have received the ap
pointment over the heads of various
admirals and rear admirals .while still
only a captain in the navy had he not
had the good fortune to marry in 1884
his cousin. Princess Alice, a grand
daughter of Queen Victoria. Of course
he is a naturalized British subject. He
owns no property in England, but has
a castle and estate at Hesse, Germany.
CZAR'S MOTHER HEADS
THE WAR FACTION.
Opposes Wife of Emperor,
Who Is in Favor of Peace.
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 7âDuring
the whole period of the recent Anglo-
Russian crisis it was evident to all
close observers that there was a strong
force continuously at work in St. Pe
tersburg striving by all possible means
to precipitate a conflict of arms be
tween Russia and England. It was
clearly evident that this force was
working in diryt opposition to the
will of the Czar and the declared pol
icy of the Foreign Minister, Count
Lamsdorff.
This force was the psessure of the
war party, which is the most powerful
outside influence brought to bear on
the Czar in Russia. Many of the ap
parent inconsistencies between the
Czar's principles and theories and the
actual methods by which he governs
Russia have been due to his inability
to carry out his own will in opposition
to that of the Russian war party.
This Russian war party is a fearful
and a wonderful organization. The im
perial court, the Ministries of State,
the army and navy, the civil service
and high society, In brief, all classes
which are able to exercise any effective
influence on the Russian Government
are honeycombed with its adherents.
The party is headed by the Czar's
mother, the Dowager Empress Maria
Feodorovna and by a group of Grand
Dukes of the Imperial family.
"One of the most remarkable features
in Russian politics is the far-reaching
influence which the Dowager Empress
exercises on the course pf public
events. It is a puxzle why the Dow
ager Empress, who came to Russia
from the most democratic court In Eu
rope, should have become more Rus
sian and more Slavonic than the mem
bers of the Russian and Slavonic im
perial family into which she married.
It is incomprehensible to the public
how a Princess educated in free and
enlightened Denmark could become the
most retrograde of all the reactionary
forces at work at the court of the Rus
sian empire.
. It is strange how the royal lady who,
â  ' / - ..'x K -'^
. .. I
as Princess Dagmar of Denmark, was
the most benevolent, soft-hearted and
gracious member of her sex, became
transformed, as the Empress Maria
Feodorovna, into a harsh, merciless
and relentless woman. Nevertheless it
is a fact that the Influence of the Czar's
mother 'has invariably been exerted
on behalf of aggression and active hos
tility toward other nations.
In thiÃ respect the influence of the
Czar's mother has always been op
posed to that of the Czar's wife, who
has remained unspoiled by the evil
atmosphere of the Russian court. The
Czarina is as much in favor of concilia
tion and peace as the Dowager Em
press is inclined to aggression and war.
This fundamental difference in their
characters and tendencies has repeat
edly caused friction and open quarrels
between the two imperial ladies, and
the Czar, in addition to his normal bur
den of troubles, has frequently been
called upon to mediate between his in
dignant wife and his angry motherâa
task more difficult than that set for
The Hague conference to accomplish.
Unfortunately the influence of the
Dowager Empress has generally proved
more powerful than that of the
Czarina, and the Czar has too fre
quently accepted the imperious be
hests of his mother when it would have
been better for his country and for
humanity if he had followed the gentle
advice of his wife.
Prominent among the Grand Dukes
who belong to the war party are Vlad
imir, Alexis, Sergius, Michael Nicho
lalevitch and Alexander Michelovitch.
Generally speaking, ali these members
of the imperial family, belong to the
war party because they are convinced
that Russia is more likely to fulfill her
mission in the world by savage aggres
sion than by civilized conciliation. They
are not only patriotic Russians, but
enthusiastic Pan-Slavs, who implicit
ly believe that the Romanoff dynasty
is destined to rule over a vast Slavonic
empire- extending over the greater part
of the earth, with Russia as its core.

Gems of Queen
Draoa Are Sold
Under Hammer
Bring Little Coin
Her Jewelry and
Rare Ornaments
Go With Lot.
LONDON, Jan. 7.âThe shadow of a
crime hung over Christie's salesroom
yesterday, when the Jewelry and
dresses of the murdered Queen Draga
of Servia went under the hammer.
The tiara which the ill-fated Queen
wore on her wedding day, her robes of
state and a bracelet given her by the
Czarâall were put up for public auc
tion, but the total sum realized was
only $11,675.
Tragedy was in the air. Society la
dies. Jostled by hawk-eyed dealers,
shuddered under their sables, as they
gazed at the gown which the dead
Queen wore on the day when Alexander
made her his Queen. Above them,
hanging on the salesroom wall, was a
portrait of Alexander and Draga. the
Queen in the bloom of her beauty.
leaning against her husband, and wear
ing that same bridal gown.
The gown, of pleated white satin,
veiled with old Bruges lace, simply
made and high in the neck, was made
in Paris four years ago. The auctioneer
suggested $300 for it, but the dealers
shook their heads. Bidding commenced
at $50 and slowly crept up to $150, at
which price it changed hands.
For the state costume, fashioned
after the royal Servian model of the
fourteenth century, and worn at all
state receptions by Queen Draga, com
petition was -keener. The robe itself
is of royal purple velvet, richly em
broidered with the arms of Servia in
gold and silver thread.
'The final bid was $1250, and both pur
chases, it is understood, were on be
half of interested Servian parties, who
will have the gowns restored to Ser
via
One of the most interesting lots was
the Czar's barbaric bracelet, with its
big emeralds and brilliants. Probably
never before has the wedding gift of
one European sovereign to the wife of
another been sold at public auction.
The Czar's wedding present was re
ported to be worth $20,000, but the high
est bid yesterday was $2200, at which
price the bracelet was sold to Mr.
Dnaysoll.
Only $575 was offered for the Persian
Order of the Sun, with its diamond star
and badge, presented to Draga by the
Shah of Persia four .years ago. In spite
of the fact that the only others known
to be in existence are those held by the
German Empress, the Czarina and
Queen Margherita of Italy.
ROSEBERY OUT OF FAVOR
WITH KING OF ENGLAND
Edward Displeased at Attire Worn by
His Lordship at 'Recent
Reception.
LONDON, Jan. 7.âlx>rd Rosebery
has fallen out of favor with the King.
He "was invited to the King's state ban
quet for the King of Portugal at
Windsor Castle, and, alone among the
guests, he appeared in ordinary even
ing dress. Even Embassador Choate
wore the knee breeches, black silk
stockings and shoes with silver buckles,
which he adopted out at deference to
King Edward's wish, while all the rest
of the company were in full officiul
regalia, with all their orders.
Rosebery seemed dumfounded on en
tering the reception room, but it was
too late to, retire and useless to try
to seclude himself, for his black clothe**
made him the most conspicuous person
in the whole assemblage. The King
looked amazed when Rosebfry ad-
vanced, and the latter made matters
worse by apologetically explaining that
it was a mistake of his valet, who had
forgotten to bring his court suit. King
Edward, who has a lynx eye for the
slightest error in the arrangement of
decorations or departure from the strict
regulations about uniforms, and at
taches great importance to correctness
in these matters, was not appeased on
hearing that Rosebery left such affairs
to his valet. The result was that Lord
Rostbery spent a most uncomfortable
evening. . â  .
Then this week Colebrooke gave
a dinner to the King, inviting Lord
Rosebery to meet him, but his Majesty
showed unmistakably he had not for
gotten the Windsor incident.18
During the past week there were sev
eral installations by Masonic lodges.

the toastmaster, and there were re

Hunter, Samuel M. Shortridge and E.

Native Daughters.
Past Grand President Eliza D. Keith,
Native Daughters of the Golden West,
chairman of the committee on promo
tion and publicity and historical in
terests, has received advice from Mrs.
Fannie L. Prather of Los Angeles Par
lor that since the Native Daughters
were Instrumental in causing to be
erected a flagstaff on Fort Moore -in
that city it has been the custom to
half-mast the flag on that pole on the
death of a Native Daughter and that in
accordance the flag was half-masted
on the death of Past Grand Presidents
Tina L. Kane and Belle Wingfield Con
rad.
Considerable comment has been made
in-the Nativo Daughter circles upon
the fact that at the flna: services over
the remains of the late Past Grand
President Mrs. Belle W. Conrad, the
Native Daughters did not take part.
While Mrs. Conrad in life was a faith
lul member of the subordinate of the
order which did hold the service her
most earnest work was for the Native
Daughters* who honored her with ele
vation to the highest position within
their gift and after her term as such
had expired she was honored with po
sitions on some of the most important
standing; committees of each Grand
Parlor. The service by another order
was at the.request of the family.
Genevieve Parlor No. 132 celebrated
the thanksgiving day of the order of
Native Daughters by an entertainment
and dance which was a very success
ful affair and netted quite a goodly
sum to the fund for the relief of the
sick of the parlor. At the last held
meeting the parlor at the close of busi
ness had a delightful entertainment
and there were rendered several very
acceptable ballads by members who
are possessed of very fine voices. After
the programme there was a Spanish
supper and speeches and the baby par
lor of South San Francisco was con
gratulated upon the progress it is mak
ing.
Miss Anna F. Lacy, whose portrait is
presented in this issue of Echoes from
the Lodge Room, is a prominent mem
ber of Las Lomas Parlor, one who has
been a very active worker and who
during her connection with the order
has filled many stations. At the last
held session of the Grand Parlor she
was elected one of the grand trustees.
Grand Secretary Laura J Frakes re
turned to this city last Monday, but
she will leave on the 11th inst. to ac
company Grand President Caminetti

night? Put me down for sixteen seats
for the opening:*' This is the kindr of
" thing, mostly in a liquid Italian-Eng
lish, that has kept the Tivoli 'phone
â  hot the last week. For this week comes
grand opera. It is the first, barring
three odd performances of "Lucia." for
. more than a year. It promises to be
the most remarkable ever given by the
Tivoli management âthat has done
things before. Be that as it may. Jona
than. Hans, and Giulioâchiefly Giulio,
v ith Y\s prfvllege of large ardorsâhas
â¢ been thus welcoming the event.
Last year in San Francisco was re
markable In that it was the first for
very many years with only a single
; grand opera presented. It is remark
able in that it was so remarkable. The
year will probably be labeled In history
. as "the one in which we had no grand
opera." For year after year, as New
York, Boston and Philadelphia, thus
. far San Francisco has had its grand
opera seasons. Diamonds, it is true,
have been as few in front as behind the
footlights at most of them. A little
'â¢matter of brains and heart and ears
was all the audiences bothered with;
and throats the singers.
â  Yet with these we have made records.
In general appreciation and familiar
knowledge of opera San Francisco
yields place to no city in the United
States. More sensitive, doubtless, is the
judgment in the aforementioned cities.
They have had the best upon which to
form judgment, and plenty of It. But
opera Is there rather an exotic than a
native necessity; the love of the few
rather than the joy of the many. Here
;Â£very one has been free of it, and
"Trovatore" here is as common whist
ling as the Fifth Symphony in a Ger
man beer garden.
The history of how this came about
is the history of the Tivoli, as every
â¢ good San Franciscan knowÃâthe pres
"ent point, however, his naive surprise
and injury In being denied his opera
'fora season. Possibly the fates thought
â¢themselves sufficiently kind in giving
us last year the handsome new Tivoli.
This new year they promise an opera
season that w ill be wrorthy of the house.
Three conductors, a chorus of fifty,
an orchestra of fifty, a soprano that be
gins next season a three-year contract
to sing the Sembrich roles with Con
ried, at least three new operas and a
few other such trifles are among the
assets of the company to appear at the
Tivoli this week.
To begin with Signor Pollacca. La
Scala and Milan know Signor Pollacca.
"Doc" Leahy knows the conductor just
as well and more interestingly. In Milan
Pollacca is known as an operatic con
ductor of first distinction, as director
of the leading symphony orchestra
and as a stage manager of genius and
brilliant energy. Besides Vhis Mr.
Leahy knows him as the extraordinary
person that would ask him. say at 10:30
o'clock in the morning, "What opera
should you like to hear to-night?"
" 'La Tosca,' " Mr. Leahy might say.
and did.
"All right. To-night you have him!"
Poila.<-i_Â». would fay. And at night Mr.
Leahy would "have him."
The pulblic? Oh, they did not mind!
This was down In lazy, ardent, unbusi
nesslike Mexico. But by noon every
one in the city knows what opera will
be given in the evening, and if a new
one the opera-house will be sold out.
It was for "Zaza," given for the first
time there this season. Berlendi, by
the way, who sings the title role, "cre

"THE GYPSY." A FASCINATING LITTLE PASTEL. BY EVELYN \LMOND
W-jfHROW, A STUDY IN STRIKING CONTRAST TO THE SERIOUS WORK
Sfjjfi DID DURING HER FOUR YHARS' SOJOURN ABROAD.
Signor Pollacca asked the Tivoli im
presario what opera he preferred to
hear as a final specimen of their work
"Zaza," Mr. Leahy decided, "but I
leave on Tuesday night." Monday
night, however, saw the Mexican pre
miere of "Zaza," with the doors of the
opera-house closed against battling
hundreds at quarter before 8 o'clock.
"They were enthusiastic?" I asked.
"They went crazy.'" Mr. Leahy, put
it. "But if they don't like a thing!
The chorus behind scenes in the third
act went wrong somehow âit was be
hind the beat, if I remember, and the
noise {he audience made was like a
million geese."
The City of Mexico is otherwise
operatically interesting. The opera, is
subsidized by the Government and is
further under the protection of what is
known as the Society Drog. This so-,
ciety is composed of some dozen of the
wealthy citizens, and what responsi
bility is unassumed by the Government
is undertaken by them. Everything is
furnished for the artists, theater, set
tings and the rest, and nothing required
of them but to sine and present a cer
tain number of new operas each sea
son. But one forgets. They are also
expected to accept with resignation
their salary two weeks in advance.
All the movements of the company
while it is in America are under the
direction of the Society Drog. It is this
organization that sees to it that Ha
vana, for example, puts up its J100;000
subsidy for the season. It is this so
ciety with which Mr. Leahy has had
to plead for the month that has been
arranged for here.
* * â¢
The company is recruited from Italy
and by report promises excellently.
Tettrazzini. the singer that will sing
the Sembrich roles w|th Conried next
year, is said to be the most favorably
known soprano in Italy at the present
time. To her presence is due the pre
ponderance of the lyric soprano ele
ment in the repertoire of operas.
"Lakme." not heard here for many
years, will be revived. "Dinorah" is
another novelty of revival. Of course
Rosina in "The Barber of Seville,"
Gilda in "Rigoletto," "Lucia" and "La
Traviata" will be upon the singer's pro
gramme.
Berlendi is in the dramatic-lyric
genre. She will be heard as Mimi in
"La Boheme," as La Tosca and as Zaza
among other roles. Incidentally, Signora
Berlendi is charmingly pretty. There
are two other sopranos, Signora Flory
and Signora Bettini. Signora Claessens
and Signora Marchi are mezzo-soprano
and contralto, # respectively.
La Puma, barytone, would Â«era to be
most prominent among thf male sing
ers. He is said to be gifted in extraor
dinary measure all round. But La
Puma will find it a tittle difficult to ef
face the memory of Gregoretti, whom
he*"is said somewhat to resemble, not to
speak of that fine old maestro, Salassa.
Interestingly the barytone may be
heard in the well-known mass of Don
Perosi, the famous monk composer,
that will probably be given some time
during the coming season. There is a
famous friendship between the com
poser and/the barytone. Romboli is the
second barytone and will make his bow
in "Rigoletto" next Wednesday night,
that opera having been chosen to open
the season. There is a third' barytone,
Rossi.
Colli, the tenor, is extravagantly her-

aided. His voice is of the lyric order
and is said to be of exceptional beauty.
There are also Bazelli and Frosini, the
latter a tenore robusto.
The basso profundo, Rossi, is said to
rival Plancon in size if not in voice.
Muynoz is the basso cantante and. with
Cervi, completes the list of principals.
With the company comes also Signor
Saporelli, stage manager, and a large
proportion of the chorus and orchestra,
not forgetting the two other conduct
ors, Signor Golisciani and SignorLongo.
Three new operas and a new com
poser will be introduced to us during
this season. Cilea and "Adrienne Le
couvreur" are the new composer and the
opera. The score of "Adrienne Le
couvreur" promises handsomely, Cilea
ranking well with the most prominent
among the younger Italians. Giordani.
whose "Andre Chenier" was so well
liked at its introduction here last sea
son, will be newly represented this year
with "Fedora." The opera is in th c .
same genre as "La Tosca" and is said
to be as vividly dramatic in its musical
treatment. "Andre Chenier" will, hap
pily, be repeated. Puccini's "Manon
Lescaut" will be the third new work.
Most interestingly the Massenet "Ma
non" will also be given, the opportu
nity to compare the French and Italian
handling of the story being one of the
rare privileges of the season. Of course,
"La Boheme" and also "La Tosca" will
be sung.
Almost rs much interest will be felt
in the revival of "Laktne." "The Pearl
Fishers" and "Linorah," operas so lone
ago presented here as to come with all
the pleasure of novelty. Two only of
the Verdi works are on* the pro
gramme. "Rigoletto" and "La. Travi
ata," unprecedented limit in local
grand opera seasons. Another curios
ity of the repertoire is its inclusion of
two Bellini operas, "La Sonnambula"
and "PPuritani." "Zaza," again, is
of the modern revivals: and "I'Pag
liaccl" will not be forgotten. Its sis
ter opera, "Cavalleria Rusticana." is
the only work by which Masoaeni will
be represented. "Faust," a possible
"Carmen," "Lucia." "Mignon" and
"The Barber of Seville" < omplete the
four weeks' repertoire. Without Signor
Polacea changes his mind some fine
morning the following programme will
be carried out next week: 'Rigoletto,'*
Wednesday; Thursday, "La Tosca";
"The Barber of Seville," Friday, and
Saturday, "Andre Chevnler."
As to prices, they will' not take more
than ?? wherever you wish to sitânot
even for Herr Conried's coming' diva.
Blessed the days of a California win
ter! Pink and purple is the sky at early
morn, and blue as the turquoise when
the sun stf out of the poft gray mist;
goldâliquid goldâwith pink and purple
dyed deep in its soul, these are the win
ter days we know in California. And
small wonder that Flora, the well be
loved, calls from the warm and fra
grant earth the fairest creatures of her
brainâthe rose, the lily, the sensuous
narcissus, to do honor to the caressing
sky. And even the sturdy redwoods,
projected at command of Pan that his
melodies have fit setting, grow to
youthful exultation in strong new arms
and nimble finger tips.
And the eucalyptus, child of a foreign
soil, a useful immigrant, laves in the
luscious moisture of these gray
mystic mornings. It is these that
Cadenasso loves. The marshes, green
in unison with the theory of earth
and red in the practice of it
red with the gross passion thereofâ
are veiled in an opalescent vapor. The
mountains, in robes of verdant velvet,
are crowned with a turquoise coronet
studded in gold. And the seaâthe deep
blue seaâlaps the white sands of the
beach in the langudrous luxury of pos
session, luring the dreamer to list to the
wooing with its exquisite sob of repres
sion.

For nature has adopted artâshe is the
foster-childâthe chiW of nature, heart

Miss Eyelyn Almond Wlthrow is a

The success of "Leah Kleschna," C.
M. S. McLellan's powerful and strik
ingly original drama, presented by
Mrs. Fiske and the Manhattan com
pany at the Manhattan Theater, New'
York, is, according to all accounts, one
of the most remarkable features of
this and many seasons. The New York
press, which, for almost the first time
within memory, was enthusiastically
unanimous in its favorable treatment
of "Leah Kleschna," has continued its
attention almost daily to what is now
on all sides acknowledged to be one of
the most pronounced all around suc
cesses in that city in years. The pub
lic throngs the Manhattan Theater, de
lighted with the play and thrilled by
the acting of it. By common consent
no company so able and so admirably
balanced has been seen in New York in
year 3 and even the holiday season,
which usually finds the theaters poorly
attended, has shown capacity audiences
at the Manhattan.
"Few better plays," says the Herald,
"or plays better acted than 'Leah
Kleschna' have been seen in New York
in a long time." "Seldom, of late,"
says the Sun, "have we been blessed
with a better play and seldom, if ever,
has a play been acted by a more bril
liant constellation of artists. It is a
success of the first magnitude, popular
and artistic." "The interest in 'Leah
Kleschna," says the Globe, "is the in
terest of a dramatic narrative well
imagined by the playwright, well told
by the player. No summary, bold or
sympathetic, would do justice to the
tale as it unfolds itself, in the literal
sense of the words, on the stage of the
Manhattan." "That the play will prove
an immense success," says the Evening
Sun, "there can be no question. The
public is famishing for real plays and
here is one magnificently acted." And
thus the comment goes.
The Theater Magazine, which is now
in its fifth year of uninterrupted suc
cess, appears for January in an en
tirely new dress. The size of the pub
lication is considerably enlarged and
the colored portrait, instead of appear
ing in the usual frame, takes up the
entire front cover, thus making a more
striking picture. The interior of the
magazine likewise shows improvement,
if, indeed, improvement is possible in
a publication which is unique of its
kind. The pictures are larger and
more numerous and the literary con
tributions continue to be in every way
of the first order.
The most important feature of the
month is an article dealing with the
real personality of Henrik Ibsen. Ap
pearing at a time when the eyes of
the whole world are turned toward
Christianiaâwhere Ibsen is supposed
to be critically illâthe article has a
peculiarly timely interest. It is written
by a close friend of the Ibsen family
and illustrated with a large and superb
portrait of the famous playwright.
Another article likely to attract at
tention is devoted to an account of the
Geisha girl of Japan, written by Yone
Noguchi, the Japanese poet. The least
understood of all the national Institu
tions of the Mikado's empire. Mr. No
guchi tells us how the Geisha is
trained, what her duties are, and what
ultimately becomes of her. The article
is illustrated with splendid pictures of
the famous Geisha girls of Tokio.
A. E. Lancaster contributes a grace
ful poem to the memory of the late
Mrs. Gilbert. The fifth paper on "Fa
mous Families of American Players" is
devoted to the Hacketts. The inter
view of the month is furnished by Da
vid Warfleld. There is likewise an en
tertaining interview with Madame Re
jane. The story of Mrs. Fiske's new
play, "Leah Kleschna," is told in a se
ries of fine flashlight pictures. Mr.
Hackett's new play, "The Fortunes of
the King," is similarly illustrated. The
other pictures include a full-page
portrait of Julia Marlowe as Juliet,
Nance O'Neil, Evie Greene as the
Duchess of Dantzic, Sir Charles Wynd
ham and Mary Moore in "Mrs. Gor
ringe's Necklace," Edward Terry, the
English comedian, who is now appear
ing in America, a full-page portrait of
Nat Goodwin, Robert Mantell, and
many other pictures of equal interest.
Next upon the list of operatic at
tractions, that this year are unusually

SOCIAL BARRIER
BROKEN DOWN
Mrs. William Astor Has Issued. 1200
Invitations to Her Ball of
January 0.
Mrs. William Astor's ball will be the
private entertainment of its
sort ever given in New York, and 300
persons are experiencing the exquisite
bliss of receiving an Astor invitation
for the first time in the;r lives. The
barriers have been let down. Approx
imately 1200 invitations have been sent
out for January 9, 1905.
Mrs. Astor, who is making social his
tory, believes in the "open door," and
has no sympathy with those Knicker
bocker matrons who onject to new
comers. She raised the original "400"
to 550 and will again swell the list.
It is to emphasize her opinions that the
cherished invitations have been sent
far and wide, and women who had
longed for them in vain are at last
rewarded.
But there are many who assign an
other reason to Mrs. Asior's 1200 In
vitations. They say this is to be the
last of her famous annual balls. There
fore, so the wiseacres say, it is natural
thai the venerable leader of society
should want the greatest audience
present at her final dance. Judging,
however, by Mrs. Astor's regular at
tendance at the opera and her presence
at Mrs. Vanderbilt's and Mrs. Henry
B. Hyde's recent dances, Mrs. Astor
has no intention of retiring from so
ciety.
The twin mansions of Colonel John
Jacob Astor and Mrs. Astor. at Fifth
avenue and Sixty-fifth street, can ac
commodate 1000 dancers easily, and
there are two drawing-rooms which
make an ideal supplementary ballroom.
Mrs. Astor, or, rather, her secretary,
Miss Simcock, has not completed ar- .
rangements. Two orchestras will be
stationed in the two ballrooms and
there will be two distinct cotillons.
Each of these cotillons will be led by
two couples and eight persons will be
leaders. Mrs. Astor has not announced
to whom these honors will be extended.
Elisha Dyer Jr. and Harry Lehr will
be two of the men and Mrs. John Jacob
Astor and Mrs. M. Orme Wilson will
be two of the women. For the other
quartet the probable leaders are Mrs.
Cornelius Vanderbilt, who helped at
the last Astor cotillon, and Mrs. Pem
broke Jones, and Worthington White
house and Henry Rogers Winthrop
may be the men.âExchange.

Ht this Juice tire ffr.iwth of God, who dare
lllaspheme the twisted tendril as a snare?
A blessing, we should use It. should we not?
And If a curse, why, then, who set it there?
Many a maid, through the chill nights
of the waning winter, hath called to
mind the lines of the Persian poet. For
know ye all that the tabbies have ele
vated a forbidding paw at the poor
little debutantes and solemnly warned
them that the sparkling wine is not
for them, nor yet for the buds of yes
teryear, but for the menâthe men and
themselves, the chaperons. And the
poor little maids sit all a-shiver during
the long hours of a dull dinner or sup
per after the ball. Now, that's mani
festly unfair âwhen t,he weather's cold,
the dinner dull or tKe supper slow, as
they ofttime? are. at eminently "smart"
affairs. Why, pray, should not a maid
have a glass or two of wine, should
she desire it, provided she is properly
chaperoned? To be sure, the most
radical social reformer wouldn't advo
cate the indiscriminate imbibing by
youthful lips, but under proper chap
eronage and at desirable times it passes
me to know why the tabbies say "nay"
when the cold bottle comes around â
and the frightened little bud turns
down her glass in external obedience,
but internal rebellion at what she
knows is a sham and a matter of rank
injustice, for she knows full well that
at home she takes just what she
pleases in the line of beverages, with
the full knowledge and consent of her
mother.
Besides, as a member of the Assem
bly or the Friday Night Club, she pays
her pro rata for the wine and the men
and the chaperons drink it. Now, that's
where she rebels, and do you blame
her? NÂ«t I. Besides, this compulsory
turning down of glasses by the de
butantesâwhether they wish to or noâ
is placing a premium upon deception.
For it wouldn't take a Sherlock Holmes
to find a group of maids at a ball, chill
and weary, wandering to the dressing
rooms in the tow of their chaperons,
for a highball or something warmer.
Just why this prudish, stupid blue-law
Of down turned glasses has been pro
mulgated this winter is not clearâ
for it is not of record, verbal or written,
that the maids ever were o'erfond of
the flowing goblet. Chaperons, unbend!
If the girls desire a glass of wine at
supper, let them have it and don't look
at them as if they had robbed a hen
roost. That which is done openly and
frankly is not a demoralizing agent,
but beware of the surreptitious act â
that degrades.

Royal Heirs of Europe Compelled to
Work and Follow Careers Like

LONDON. Jan. 7.âPrince Edward
of Wales, commonly called Prince Da
vid, who one day may be Kins; of Eng

been taken to Osborne, Isle of Wight,
in order that they may commence
their public career. The little Princes
are to begin as did their father, with
the navy. They will be gazetted mid
shipmen, and at Osborne will learn all
the "ropes" possible before joining a
man-of-war.
Royalties nowadays do not allow
their children to remain idle, and of all
royal families none is more strenu
ously brought up than the German
Emperor's. Each of his six sons has
had to work hard and to learn to fol
low gome career, just as if they were
nobodies. The sailor of the family is
Prince Adelbert. who is just 20. He
was a sub-lieutenant at 6 years old, and
has spent his life learning to be a
sailor. He is now lieutenant on the
Hertha and traveling far away in the
East. He is now at Bangkok paying a
visit to the King of Siam.
Prince Adelbert is a very great ad
mirer of his sailor uncle, Prince Henry
of Prussia, and he is fond of telling a
certain story which illustrates that
brave seaman's pluck. Prince Henry
was in command of the Olga whan the
vessel was in the North Bea He or
dered his men to bathe, and they did
not relish a bath in the cold waters on
a particularly cold day. So an officer
was sent to remonstrate with Princs
Henry, who immediately and without
a word sprang from the bridge into the
sea and swam about for a few minutes.
Then he clambered back, all dripping
in his uniform, and said, "Is it still
too cold?" Every one took a bath after
that.

FAIR SWINDLER
SHOWS EMOTION
Mrs. Dorothy Booked
on Charger of Obtaining
Money by False Pretense j
EYES FILL WITH TEARS
Her Attorney Fails So Far
in Getting Into Communi
cation With Her Husband
Mrs. Dorothy McCabe showed the
first signs of emotion yesterday since
her incarceration on Thursday. She
bore the ordeal without flinching of
having her photograph taken for the
rogues' gailery, but when she was
booked at the City Prison later on two
charges of obtaining money by false
pretenses she began to realize the
gravity of her position and tears welled
into her eyee.
Promises had been made that the
worthless checks passed by the fair
defendant would be taken up, but as
there was no appearance of the coin
yesterday morning R. J. Campbell of
the Emporium and E. G. Davis of
Weinstock, Lubin & Co., called at the
Bond and Warrant Clerk's office and
each swore to a complaint before Po
lice Judge Mogan charging Mrs. Mc-
Cabe with a misdemeanor of obtaining
money by false pretenses.
At the Emporium she presented a
check for $50 and asked to have it
cashed, as she desired to make a few
purchases. The cashier remarked that
it was unusual to do so and besides he
did not know her. "Why," she replied.
"Mr. Martin, the manager, has often
cashed checks for me. I am surprised."
The cashier did not like to offend a
lady friend of the manager and hand
ed her the $50. When he spoke to the
manager about it the manager said he
had never heard of the woman. At
Weinstock, Lubin & Co.'s she purchased
goods and got the difference between
the amount and the $50 check in cash.
The Arm of R. D. Davis & Co. has not
yet taken action, but Detectives Dinan
and Wren say that a warrant will be
sworn to by a member of the firm to
morrow morning. It will be a felony,
as the amount is $75.
When Mrs. McCabe was booked on
the two charges she said her name
was Mrs. Percy J. McCabe. When
asked her Christian name she replied,
"Dorothy." She gave her age as 20 and
her birthplace as Baltimore, Md. She
said she was a married woman. She
left the booking desk with her hand
kerchief pressed against her eyes.
Attorney Farrar, who is looking after
her interests, called to see her several
times at the prisc-n yesterday. He'said
he had been trying to get into com
munication with her husband, who is
a mining man in Southern California,
but had so far failed. As soon as he
did so he felt sure the necessary funds
would be forthcoming to take up all
the checks. He said that all her credi
tors nad promised to give her time ex
cept the Emporium and Weinstock Lu
bin & Co.

CTRRY, WHO KILLED WIFE.
WILL PLEAD INSANITY
A plea of insanity will be set up for
the defense at the trial of George
Curry, charged with the murder of
his wife. Daisy, at .35 Turk Street on
July 4. They had been married only
two months when she left him to live
with a barber. Curry, who was a
street car conductor, called at her
room and on her refusal to return to
him shot and killed her. When ar
rested he calmly admitted having
committed the deed, saying he was
provoked because his wife vigorously
shipped his face.
Yesterday Attorney Frank J. Mur
phy appeared before Judge Dunne
and asked that a commission be ap
pointed by the court to take the testi
mony of the defendant's mother and
other witnesses living at Hazelhurst,
Ga. It was alleged they would prove
that from his childhood the de
fendant had shown symptoms of in
sanity. The Judge granted the re
quest and continued the case for four
weeks.

Senora de Barnethe Sells
Her Home to Help Her Sick
! Mother and Poor Aunt
SHE BECOMES A PAUPER
Goes Back to Mexico to Be
Cared For by Her More
Fortunate Belatives There
Deporting a woman for the sake of
charity is a new procedure in the work !
of the United States Immigrant Bu- 1
reau, but t was done yesterday in the
case of Senora Christina Quintlnilla de |
Barnethe, a Mexican fifty years old. j
She had a good home in Mazatlan, but
gave it up to assist her old mother i
and her aunt. Senora de Barnethe s i
husband died fifteen years ago and left 1
her a nice little home in Mexico. A j
year ago last February her mother j
wrote to her from this city that she
and her sister were sick and in dire I
distress and* without food or proper [
clothing. Out of pure goodness of heart
the woman sold her home in Ma- j
zatlan and hurried here to the relief of j
her relatives. The three lived in one !
room at 1318 Dupont street, and Chris- j
tina supported them and hersetf by '
needlework. Soon all the money was ]
gone and the three were in sore straits.
Finally they were obliged to appeal to j
charity and tell their saa story to the !
public.
The Spanish Benevolent Society has
offered to take charge c-f the two older I
women, and Senora de Barnethe is ]
willing to go back to Mazatlan, where j
she has a sister who is able and will- j
mg to take care of her. But she has no
money to pay for her transportation, !
and in this emergency United States j
Immigrant Commissioner Hart H. j
North was asked to order her deported
to Mazatlan on the ground that she j
has become a public charge. The own
ers of the steamship Curacao have ex- j
pressed a willingness to take her back j
to Mexico, and she will start for home I
on the next trip of the Curacao.

recover possession of a silk waist,
tailor made suit and other personal
property from Mrs. Rita Pratt, 725
Ellis street. She said she had been a
guest at Mrs. Pratt's house for a few
days and when she was leaving on
Friday Mrs. Pratt demanded $10 for

Cable Splicer Severely Injured.
Albert Harms, a cable splicer, while
at work splicing: a cable in the Hayes
street power-house yesterday morning,
met with an accident which will in all
probability terminate fatally.
In making the splice he was using
a piece of machinery known as the
'twister." The instrument freed itself
from the belt that controls it and
struck Harms a blow on the head, in
flicting a deep gash. The injured man
was treated at the Park Emergency
Hospital by R. C. Hill and after
ward removed to St. Luke's Hospital.
There is little hope of his recovery.

ABOUT THE FORESTS.
THE sessions of the National Forestry Congress in Washington
have been unusually lively. The Secretary of Agriculture
delivered an address which will be long remembered. He made
a reasonable presentation of the whole subject of the effect of
denudation uf the surface of land in the arid region. The grass and
forage plants and the forests in those regions have the same func
tion and perform the same office in the conservation of moisture
and its storage in the ground. The grazing lands of the country,
lit only for grazing, have been rapidly returned to desert condi
tions by overstocking, and the forests are in danger of destruction
by excessive and destructive lumbering. Logically, the preservation
of the forests by conservative lumbering and of the ranges by con
servative stocking go together, and it is for the Government, in co
operation with the lumbermen and stockmen, to reach a policy thai
will secure these desirable results. % ,
President Roosevelt also delivered a notable address, and like
â¢ the Secretary of Agriculture, spoke from abundant knowledge. He
has been a stock ranger and has a wide acquaintance with Western
forest conditions. He also returns the confidence which the West
has just given to him, and is of the opinion that the Western people
can be relied on to promote measures for the conservation of moist
ure by proper handling of forests and grazing lands. After these
two very useful and suggestive addresses, Mr. Maxwell appeared
upon the scene, in battle array, and emitted epithets and accusations
as a Gatling does bullets. He antagonized the President's statement
of the disposition of the Western people and declared them untit
to be trusted in the management of lands and unworthy to be taken
into counsel about measures that concern themselves.
The West will feel this blow. It is probable that no greater
misfortune can happen tp any section of the country than to fall
under Mr. Maxwell's displeasure and condemnation. Hereafter,
when the forest and range are under discussion, the session will be
executive and the West will withdraw. It is true that there are
land frauds in the arid region and the West. But there have been
frauds and charges of fraud in all* of the public land States. Land
hunger is not a new appetite. It was felt by past generations and
to satisfy it men aforetime were willing to risk barking the shins of
their reputations against the law. Just now there is ample proof
that land hunger is responsible for fraud and criminality, and men
in high station are put upon their defense for complicity. But to
make this the basis for a wholesale impeachment of the honesty,
honor and public spirit of the West is to utter spiteful nonsense,
which merely expresses the keen disappointment of Mr. Maxwell
because the West defeated his scheme for getting millions out of
the treasury for irrigation that would never find their way back.
The Western members of Congress who, against his opposition,
framed the Federal irrigation law provided therein that the fund
should be supplied from the proceeds of the sale of public land, and
that it should be a revolving fund, every dollar of it finally going
back into the treasury. It is painful for some men to think of a
dollar once taken out of the treasury ever getting back home, and
this feeling has actuated much of the war whooping against the
West to which the Eastern people are treated. The West averages
as honest, trustworthy and public spirited as any section of the
country.
If anything can discredit the forest policy of the country, a- c
reasonably promoted by the President, the Department of Agriculture
and Mr. Pinchot. it is Mr. Maxwell's demand that we appropriate
as much annually for the forest as we do for the navy and for fortifi
cations. Every forester knows what forestry in Europe proves, that
scientific administration of the forests will not only pay its own
cost, but will yield a revenue that may be diverted to other public
purposes, or may be devoted to the reforestation of denuded lands.
The continued insistence that we cannot preserve our forests, handle
them conservatively, use them for economic purposes and at the
same time make them permanently productive of timber and per
manently conservative of moisture, without taking two hundred
millions a year from the national treasury, will discredit the whole
movement and condemn it as a gigantic graft. We want more edu
cated foresters and fewer forest orators and men who declaim in
millions and try to use sentiment as a jimmy to open the treasury.
Under the wise and conservative policy of Mr. Pinchot the
owners of timber land, who may do what they please with it. may
destroy it at one lumbering or may make of it permanent forest,
are everywhere asking for trained foresters to guide them in so cut
ting their ripe timber as to preserve the growing crop. Admonished
by the wasteful lumbering of the pine lands of Wisconsin and
Minnesota, the millmen are acquiring respect for scientific forestry
that was not felt by the early lumbermen of the Middle West. They
find in the forests of the semi-arid and Pacific Coast region natural
conditions most favorable to the permanency and rapid growth of
the valuable coniferous forests. They are beginning to see their
own permanent interests through the wise eyes of Mr. Pinchot, and
it is safe to say that if foresting' can be kept out of the hands of
the grafters the Western forests, that are profitable and productive
now, will be profitable and productive and conservative of moisture
centuries from now. All this will come about without breaking into
the treasury, but by replenishing it. The West can be trusted as
implicitly as any section of the country and pleads not guilty to Mr.
Maxwell s indictment. (
AMONG the candidates figuring in the Senatorial contest at
Sacramento is Mr. Fisk, Postmaster of this city. He is a
worthy and able man, but is he eligible? The State constitu
tion, article IV. section 20. says: "No person holding'any lucrative
office under the United States, or any other power, shall be eligible
to any civil office of profit under this State; provided, that officers in
the militia who receive no annual salary, local officers or post
masters whose compensation does not exceed $500 per annum, shall
not be deemed to hold lucrative offices." The office of Senator of
the United States is held under this State. The State issues the
commission which makes a man Senator. It is therefore a State
position. The United States cannot choose a man or commission him
to that office.
It is true that the Federal constitution makes the Senate the
judge of the election and qualification of its own members, and the
Senate is competent to disregard the provisions of the State con
stitution respecting eligibility. But before the question can reach
the Senate the State has to ac"t by its Legislature. The Legislature
is created by the constitution of the State, each member taking an
oath to support that instrument. The Legislature cannot disregard
a constitutional requirement respecting eligibility. The Legislature
is bound by the constitution, and the constitution makes it incompe
tent to elect an ineligible person to the Senate.
Here arises a very interesting question. Should the Legislature
do what it is constitutionally incompetent to do. is not the act
null and void? If so, the commission is void and its presentation
gives the United States no jurisdiction. The State constitution also
disqualifies the Governor for election to the Senate during his term.
Would the Legislature violate the constitution by electing him in
the face of that disqualification? Obviously it would. Then would it
not also violate the constitution by electing any one disqualified un
der section 20, article 1 IV?
The constitution especially giants the powers that may be ex
ercised by each of the co-ordinate branches of the State government.
An act in excess of the constitutional grant is in excess of the
power of either branch, and the Legislature would exceed its power
by assuming to elect a Senaior that is disqualified. We do not know
whether the United States, Senate has ever passed upon the question
in this form. But it has passed upon the competency of a body
claiming to be a Legislature to elect a Senator. We think this was
AS TO ELIGIBILITY.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY. JANUARY 8, 1905.
SIMPLE LOVE ALONE
CAN LAST.
BY DOROTHY FEfllMORE:
simply. It is harder than it
looks if you are seeking difficult
methods of expression. And it is
easier than any one would believe
who was not born with a gift for
simplicity. At any rate, you had bet
ter try it, if you happen to be in love,
yet have never done so.
The fact is, you see, that this con
stitutes the final test of affection. If
you and your sweetheart cannot love
happily on the level of every day you
will have to wait indefinitely for your
millennium.
Once, when I was crossing the ocean,
an incident occurred which made me
laugh at first, and then it made me
sorry. In the steamer-chair right next
to mine on deck was a pretty girl who
was sweeping silently but bitterly.
I could not help putting to her the
sympathetic question: "What is it,
may dear.'.' Can I help you?"
She stopped crying long enough to
look me over. Then her tears began
anew.
"I didn't think that Charlie would
ever see me with my hair out of curl,"
she sobbed.
And then, of course, I knew she was
a bride. And I made a guessâwhich
Charlie's attitude when he appeared
changed into a convictionâas to what
their courtship had been like; it was,
without a doubt, a pretty little am
ourette, based on sentiment that was
real as far as it went, but whose
charm was chiefly of makeup and
background. The young things did not
know the first principles of compan
ionship. They had not learned the A,
B C's of the art, or the scienceâwhich
ever you choose âof loving on the level
of every day.
The colors on such a romance as this
are as shallow as the tints on a but
terfly's wing. You can rub them off
with your finger.
Of course youth and maturity look at
love from different standpoints. To the
one it means a thrill, a throbbing of
the pulses, a bewilderment of the
senses, a sweet delirium of fancy. But
to the latter, to whom time has brought
the blessed knowledge that gray days
are In their own way as beautiful as
are the days of gold, love does not ap
pear as a Fata Morgana, splendid mis
tress of all the treasure caverns of the
earth, but as a household angel, with
an aura of happiness encircling her
gentle brow.
The poet Wordsworth, who, all his
life, with simple, grateful heart, read
nature's lessons from her open book. I
I (lone in the Montana case and also in the contest from Alabama
against Spencer. In these cases rival bodies each claimed to be the
lawful Legislature under the constitution of the State, and the Sen
ate had to decide whether either body was competent under the con
stitution of the State to act as a Legislature. Surely there is a close
, legal analogy between the constitutional capacity of a Legislature to
do anything and its competency to do one thing which the constitu
tion forbids that it do.
We suggest the matter as of interest to constitutional lawyers
; and public men. and without any desire to injure the fortunes of
I any aspirant for the Senate.
HABIT and tradition play a conspicuous part in commerce. To
them we owe the slow and hard fight that California wines
have had to make to secure a market in their own country.
ITo the same is due that long sustained belief that only imported
hydraulic cement is fit for use. Scarcely any other article, except
ing iron and coal, has entered as largely as cement into economic
! use in this country.' A gentleman in New York with extensive rela
tions to large constructive works said that in the past there had
i been the stone age and the iron age. but this might well be named
the cement age, because the use of that material enters so generally
into all construction. It is used to make artificial stone that out
lasts either the igneous or sedimentary rocks, because its evenness
of texture is absolutely under the control, of the manufacturer. In
j concrete and a vast variety of forms cement is used and vast works
: would be impossible without it.
California has achieved the production of a hydraulic cement
! that equals the best imported article in all respects and excels it
â¢in some. Since this California article got into the market the im-
I portation of Belgian and German cement has declined 75 per cent,
j The domestic article has had to contend against disadvantages in
I transportation, as well as against habit and tradition, use and
j custom, and has been subjected to very trying tests, and that it
l-has shut out three-fourths of the foreign cement is evidence that
lit has met all of the requirements of contractors and engineers. It
is fortunate that this manufacture is permanently installed here, for
the Government irrigation works will be sure to require large quan
tities of cement, and the availability of an American article should
! not escape the attention of those concerned.
Californians may well be proud that another vast use is
j made of the natural resources of the State by the conversion of its
clays and stone into a cement that will soon be added to the list of
, exports of the country.
THE OREGONIAN'S ANNUAL.
THE -Portland Oregonian's Annual for the new year is one of
the best edited and best illustrated newspaper supplements that
have appeared during the holiday season anywhere in the \\ r est.
Especial interest attaches to this issue because of the detailed ac
count contained therein of every projected feature of the Lewis and
j Clark Centennial, which opens its doors to the world next summer.
Every detail of the big fair, either now in the course of erection
or soon to be completed, is pictured and described in an adequate
' manner. Furthermore, the paper conveys the cheering information
! that the exposition will be opened absolutely free from debt. Already
, the sum of $1,510,000 has been subscribed by the United States
; Government, various State Legislatures and private corporations of
! Portland. With this substantial stockingful in hand and prospects
'of more coming, the Oregonian is justified in announcing that
j financial difficulties will not be a feature of the fair's managing.

cup by which you quench your living
thirst by the waters of life, bitter or
sweet, that spring up by the way you
pass.
Love simply. Love with all the heart
you have. There is no way that your
capacity for loving can grow except
through loving. And do not be afraid
to say, "I love you" to the one to
whom by your own act your love be

LONG FAST.
After fasting for twenty-four days W,
B. Lakenan of Montpelier ate his first
hearty meal in Hartford City, Ind., a
few nights ago at the New Era restau
tant. He said: "For the past month 1
have not been feeling well, and as I
am a believer in Christian science I
would take no medicines. The trouble
was with my blood, and I thought if I
could quit eating for several days I
would soon begin to feel better. For
fourteen days 1 took nothing but a little
lemon water. On the fifteenth day I
took a cracker and drank a little ice
water and became deathly sick. I be
gan to fast again, and to-night is the
first hearty meal I have eaten since 1
began fastjpg on the 13th day of No
vember."
Lakenan said he was feeling excep
tionally good, and from the size of the
supper he ate at the restaurant he must
have been.
VEIL DANGERS.
n
According to the Petit Parisien. Paris
ladies have just been warned authori
tatively that the wearing of a veil
adorned with a pattern is the direct
cause of a multitude of diseases of the
eye. So is the wearing of veils covered
with black or white spots, their special
quality being to throw the eyes out of
focus. "Illusion" veils of very fine ma
terial are said to be the least harmful,
especially if they are black and worn
close to the eyes. We believe that sim
ilar warnings have already been given.
Indeed, one sometimes wonders what
is the purpose of the spots on a veil.
Really you might almost as well wear
frescoes on your spectacles.
Too Big for Comprehension.
The sun is a million times larger
than our earth, but if we increase the
sun's size ten thousand times, we only
reach the volume of such mammoth
suns as Arcturus, Canopus, Antares,
and Beta Centauri. It is estimated that
a motor car traveling at the rate of
UK) miles an hour would take 8000 years
to go once round Beta Centauri, and
far longer than this to go round either
Arcturus or Canopus.

A SLEEPER o
CINDERELLA
BY lZOLfl FORRESTER.
(Copyright, 1905, by Izola Forrester.)
IT was late when Sercombe boarded
the midnight special from Chicago to
St. Louis. He felt annoyed. Every
berth was taken except the upper
one in section five. Nearly all the
I others were made up and occupied as
[ well. He left his grip and overcoat on
one of the seats and went to the smok
ing compartment for consolation.
Except for a stout, clean-sha m
party at the end of the corner table he
was alone. The train had left Jollet
before Sercombe was on speak'ng terms
with the stout party. He was J. Wil
cox Wood of St. Louis, and "almighty
glad to get back, sir."
Sercombe accepted the information
unsociably. Just how any one could
want to get back to St. Louis was be
yond his comprehension. On that par
ticular night he wished that St. Louis
was a swamp, flooded by its own mud
dy river. To be hustled out of Chicago
for six weeks, at the particular mo
ment when he was expecting the firm
to hand over the management of the
New York office, was the hardest test

He was too young:! That was what
old Griswold had said. Parker, the
junior partner, would have sent him
down if he had had the say-so about
the appointment. And he had
he was solid with the old man, too.
During the four years he had been with
the firm he had tried faithfully to do
the square thing. Griswold had said
that he liked him, too. personally.
"You're all right, boy. Keep jogging.
You'll get there, all rightâonly keep
cool. You're a bit too much this side
of thirty to take hold of the New York
end. I want to give you a whirl in
St. Louis."
Sercombe rose suddenly and threw
away his cigar savagely. J. Wilcox
Wood was chatting volubly on the
other side of the table on the renais
sance epoch in St. Louis that was to
follow the World's Fair.
"Get in on the ground floor, old man.
If you **cc anything coming your way
down here hit it to kill. It's certainly
poing to be the center of the circle."
"Good night," said Sercombe curtly.

The Japanese have no use for but

hundreds of knots. Some are as old as
the time when history was recorded
by a series of knots, just as it was In
China and Peru before writing was In

common and ceremonial usage, and
these every Japanese child can tie. To
name only a few, there are plum blos

comfortable. He had just fallen asleep
when something struck him in the fate
and he wakened with i; shook, ex
acting the horrors ..f a wreck to crusn
in on him. But absolute peace and
quiet reigned thr-.ugh the car. Th
opalesrent globes on the lamps trem
bled slightly with the motion of the
train, but that was all.
Sercombe sat up and reached tor his
watch under the pillow. As he did so
his hand came in contact with the mis
sile that had struck him lying back of
the pillow. It was a lady's slipperâ
a small, black, patent leather affair.
The heel was French, but moderately
high, and there were three sets of V
shaped straps that buttoned across the
instep. Sercombe examined it curi
ously. A slipper iike that expressed
the character of the person who had
purchased it. it was dainty, effective,
distinctive, not extreme, designed for
comfort and yet perfect in style. It
seemed ridiculously small for a wom
an's foot. Finally he let conjecture
slip into acceptance of the chance that
had tossed it to him, and fell asleep
with it under his pillow. In the morn
ing he decided he would play the Princa
and go on a still hunt for his sleepar
Cinderella.
He rose early. The train was
scheduled to arrive in St, Louis at
j 7:30 o'clock and he had no intention
â¢of letting Cinderella run away. One
|by one the berths were made up and
!he scanned the occupants eagerly.
I Five ladies appeared. Alter a careful,
[ judicious survey Sercombe settled on
the owner of the slipper. He fait
positive that she was the only one
who could possibly wear such a slip
per.
She was in section seven. He could
see her head with its masses of red
brown hair, the fluffiest, waviest, most
willful hair he remembered ever hav
ing seen. He noticed, also, that aha
did not rise and having sauntered
casually up and down the aisle, he
saw that her gray silk traveling cloak
covered her feet completely. It was
almost 7:30 o'clock. Sercombe took
the slipper from his side coat pocket
and paused at section seven.
"I beg your pardon," he said, "but
I think I have your slipper."
She glanced up at him in amused
surprise, as he laid the slipper in her
lap. Sercombc's heart started up a
ragtime "come-all-ye" as he looked
down in her eyes and tried to ex
plain the extraordinary fact that he
had been struck in the head by her
slipper about two in the morning,
whin suddenly he heard the voice of
[ J Wilcox Wood speak to him across
the ais^e.
"That slipper's mine, my boy," he
said, jovially. "Just hand it over, will
you?"
Before Sercombe could speak he
went on apologetically:
"You see, I had the upper berth
across from you. Some one disturbed
the peace last night by playing a noc
turne on their nasal organ, under
stand? I thought that it was you. sir.
and took the liberty of throwing one
of my samples at you to break the
spell. This morning I found out that
it wasn't you at all. It was the old
boy in the lower berth. No offense!
Have a cigar? I just had one with
the old boy to square matters."
While Sercombe hesitated old man
Griswold came leisurely down the aisle,
and put out his hand.
"Hello, Archie. Didn't waste any
time getting down, did you? Thought
we'd get In a little ahead of you and
start things moving. Flora, this is
Archie Griswold, manager of our
Louis branch. Had breakfast? No?
Then come home with us!"
Four months later Sercombe, Junior
partner of the firm of Griswold, Ser
combe & Co., sent an order to ona J.
Wilcox Wood, shoe salesman of Bt.
Louis, for a pair of bridal slippers,
duplicates in white kid of a certain
other pair that had changed the cur
rent of fate for him. and this time he
had the satisfaction of fitting them
himself on the feet of Flora Griswold.

happy looks and grunts. If you would
prove this assertion, stop scratching
the pig for a moment, and it will look

FACTS fIBOUT "FRENZIED" LAWSON
THAT Thomas W. Lawson is a
unique American product is
acknowledged by his worst
enemy.
He is tall, well built, with a
ruddy complexion, a mass of i
black hair, sharp, piercing eyes that
look you through and through and a
square jaw. His hands are remarkably |
small for such a big man.
Mr. Lawson began his business career
in 1872, when at the age of 15 he made
a fortune by speculating in shares of J
Cincinnati, Sandusky and Cleveland
Railroad stock, which dropped from $50
a share to $3. He had been a spender,
even at the age of 12 years. At that
time he received a present of $100. He
spent $87 on a present for his sister and
the rest went toward making his broth
er happy.
When he made the fortune in Cincin
nati, Sandusky and Cleveland stock he
made the money fly while it lasted. He
COURTSHIP AND THE SIMPLE LIFE
lightly a few seeds from our storehouse
of knowledge, so that you may form
some idea of the tremendous bulk of
grain reposing in our mental bins.
In our travels and peregrinations we
have lately noticed a small army- of
gentlemen standing on street corners
and handing out (for a consideration)
copies of a book entitled the "Simple
Life." We bought a copy, we read it;
irresistibly we brought the tremendous
weight of our intellect to bear upon
the subject until we now are ready to
use it for a text, to construe it, to ela
borate it, to restrict it, to criticize it,
to approve it; to frown upon it, to
swear by it, to swear at It, to treat It
seriously, to treat it lightly, to praise
it, to damn it, to hold it up aa a model,
to throw it down as a horrible example,
or to preserve a weighty silence over
it, meanwhile breathing heavily, look
ing wise and smiling inscrutably.
But no.
Young men of the nation (we repeat),
give heed. And bo, ye widows and
spinisters, hide your heads! For we are
about to lay down a few elementary
rules of the simple life as applicable
to the subject of courting, of wooing,
of loving, of keeping company, of going
with a girl, of sparking seriously, of
paying attentions, of looking for a wife,

Saloon Man Has Not Weakened in the Battle Royal With the Oil King
Financier Is Always Either Making or Losing a Fortune
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 8. 1905.
bitions move us now as they did
when man first began to think, only
now the veneer is put on thicker and
the varnish is more artistically laid
on. Hence the degree of assurance
we feel that we may dare toy with
the pastimes that ruined empires and
indulge in excesses that annihilated
the races of old. Nothing new under
the sun. No. Not even oppression,
which sprang into life twin sister of
cupidity. For of old has oppression
been the instrument by which ambition
without ability has forced its hold
upon the world, and even Caesar, like
the Prophets, wept when the poor
cried.
Money? Yes. that is itâthe root of
all evil and the universal provider.
Money is and was the standard by
which men's worth was judged in all
ages when materialism absorbed

part of the Rockefeller forces consists
in buying up a whole town in order to
take away the patronage of the offend
ing saloon.
In the meantime the war is on and
Melin's flag is still Hying. But in the
interim, every time that the reputed
richest man in the world is driven to
the Tarrytown railway station to catch
a train for New York he is obliged to
pass this one-story shanty with
the glaring legend informing the
thirsty wayfarer that all kinds of wet
goods, from blown pop and Herkimer
County applejack to yellow peril beer
and whisky warranted tfc kill while you
wait, may be had within. Some men
snuggling with total abstinence prin
ciples might avoid the impudent little
gin mill by riding cross country on the
back of a thoroughbred hurdle jumper,
or chartering an airship: others might
circumvent the wily dealer in red
liquor by constructing a subway from

j est sum of $59,841 in jig time. But that
; left him with a hundred and fifty odd
I dollars, which he spent in giving his
; friends a dinner, handing his last $5
, note to the head waiter.
That left Mr. Lawson with clean
,' decks, but it did not take him long to
J get into the game again. For the last
; thirty years no man has made and lost
j the fortunes like him; no man has
| spent the millions that he has in so
j many differen; ways. His motto is:
"If you spend money, spend it like a
gentleman," and he has lived up to
this. If he wants a thing he buys it,
just as he did when he paid $30,000 for
the famous Lawson pink.
In the last historic crash of Amalga
mated Copper Lawson is said to have
lost $7.000,000âa mere bagatelle. Since
that time he has made that much over
and over again at times, according to

Sundays, of taking her home, of walk
ing out with her, of saying "Snip" to
her "Snap," of visiting Miss Right, or
any other of the multitudinous and
euphemistic methods of expression em
ployed by the interested parties when
they wish to refer to that interesting
era of their lives that begins when
sanity ceases and ends when marriage
begins.
In the days before wisdom descended
upon us frequently have we enriched
a sneering florist, a hausrhty cabdrlver,
a supercilious ticket speculator, a domi
neering hat boy and a blase waiter, all
in order that the girl with us might
be gratified and amused. Complexi
ties! And now let the whole tribe from
the florist to the waiter tremble in their
boots, for their sun is fast declining
in the west and will soon be blotted
out completely by these, our rules and
regulations for the proper courtship of
misses and other marriageable female
persona
In the first place, flowers must be
dispensed with. Few things are as
complex as a gift of flowers. Should
the donor tote them around himself or
send them in advance? If he takes
then, himself, should he hurl them at
the girl the moment he sees her, .or
elusion of all things else. Money
then becomes God and supplants
Deity even in the sanctuary. The
church is called the house of God.
yet what poor man feels at home in
his Father's house? Fashionâmoney
is here in all its luxurious vociferous
ncss, and the rich sit near to and the
poor far from the altar of God. And
the modestly clad sister shudders at
beholding the lavish costume of the
sister in a select pew, and her mind
wan/iers from devotion to contem
plation not devout at all. And the
other oneâwell, maybe if she grieves
she really seeks God, but mostly "the
eyes of all are not turned to him, but
gazing upon others."
Money has its penalties, too, for
those who possess it must take proper
social rank, must entertain; and Mrs.
Empty-Head invites her lady friends
for an afternoon and evades the ne
cessity of performing her duty as
their mansion to the railway tracks.
But Mr. Rockefeller has other ways
ways that have resulted in the ex
penditure of much money and that
have. Incidentally. brought much
trouble to the door of John Melin.
But during all this battle royal which
has extended over a period of three
years, and which has not yet reached
its culmination. Melin has never weak
ened, but, on the contrary, has thus
far beaten his multi-millionaire an
tagonist at every point. In vain Mr.
Rockefeller has attempted to buy out
the saloon-keeper. His agents have
offered big prices, begged und coaxed,
but this squat-legged, broad-shouldered
Swede has shaken his head and said he
knew his business. Now Rockefeller
has adopted new tactics. He is buying
up the whole town of Uriggsville, in
which Melin does business, on the logi
cal deduction that if there are no peo
ple to drink whisky and beer there will
common report, says a writer in the
Baltimore Sun.
So far as skyrocket speculation goes
he excels even the "Betcher-a-million"
John W. Gates. When he loses a fight
he likes to write a book about his
troubles and show up (he inside work
ings of the financial world from his
point of view to illustrate what little
chame the general public has to make
money unless by blind luck.
As one of the most versatile and pic
turesque American millionaires Mr.
Lawson is always doing something new
When he bought the famous pink there
were other bidders for the flowers. A
New York concern offered $2000 for the
slip, Harlow W. Galvin made it $6000,
another florist made the bid of $15,000
and Lawson jumped it to $30,000.
No reverses in life ever stung him so
deeply as the wound inflicted by the
New York Yacht Club. He built the
sloop Independence and it looked for a
should he say "How-do" first? If he
should say "How-do" first, is he to ap
pear conscious or unconscious of the
bokay in h.s hand? Should the girl ap
pear to see it? Or should each avoid
looking the other in the eye until he
says "Oh. I've brought a few flowers
for you"? Should he, by any possibil
ity, hide them behind his back until the
first greetings are over?
Of a grave complexity is this, the at
tempted solution of which will cause
the Queen of Reason to totter on her
throne, while grinning Bedlam whis
pers words of horrid revolution to the
fagged-out little workers of the mind.
Beware, young men, beware!
And what are cabs? Complexities
pure and simple. Should the gentleman
haggle with the driver of the cab either
before or after riding? If he once
takes her in a cab, should he always
take her in a cab? Otherwise, will she
think his love is growing cold? Should
he lean back in the cab? Should he
act as though he always rode In cabs?
Should he assume that she Is accus
tomed to cabs? Or should he accentu
ate the fact that he is giving her a
treat, saying, "Isn't it nice to ride in
cabs?" or "How much nicer It is to
ride in a cab and think how much
nicer it is to rids in a cab than it is

themselves. Card tables are spread
around and all are to play for prizes;
after play refreshments, hand shakes.
"Oh, what a delightful time, V s -
Empty-Head; so glad you invited
us." Another afternoon is wasted.
Pastime is no more a recreation; it I
is the only business of lite. But this '
is not all. It would not do never to \
win a prizeâthat would be a reflec- J
tion upon some other vacuous era- i
nium. So they cheat. But no one
cares âthe hostess -provides the prizes
and no one is really hurt, except
morallyâbut then it is fashionable, j
In time, however, it comes hard on
Mrs. Empty-Head to continue pro
viding prizes, so the callers at cards
play for a little stake just to make it
interesting. And then they lose and
their husbands have need of spoilâ
"more spoil," for already "they have
taken the wings of a stork to flit to
and fro to build a temple to folly." *

Mr. Rockefeller is said to have been
in some big fights in his life. He has
achieved the reputation of having suc
cessfully led battles in which millions
of dollars were involved. Wall street
has eyed him with suspicion and ad
miration. He has conquered all ob
stacles in a gigantic enterprise that
has, in tfs magnitude, astounded the
financiers of two hemispheres. But in
all his fights, in all his financial calcu
lations. It is doubtful if he has ever en
tered into a battle with more vim and
more grim determination to come out
the victor than he has in this warfare
with the other John, who has planted
himself dÂ«.wn on his stocky legs like a
bulldog with the resolve to stick it out
as long as there is a bark and a bite
left in him. And Wall street and Po-
time as if she might be chosen to de- (
fend the America's cup, but the New-
York Yacht Club declared the boat to j
be barred because Mr. Lawson was \
not a member of the. club.
After writing a book about the dis- j
appointment, entitled "The Lawson
History of the America's Cup; A Rec-:
ord of Fifty Years," he smashed the ;
Independence to bits and made souve- |
nirs of her plates.
Mr. Lawson says that only one per- j
son can help a man in this world and
that person is himself. Certainly few
have helped him, for he has many ene
mies.
"They are all thoroughbreds," he
says of his enemies. "Every one of
them would rise from a sound sleep to
do me an injury. Long may they live.
They put spice into life."
To most men the loss of a couple of
million dollars would be a blow from J
which they would never recover. Not I
to walk, than it is to walk and to
think how much nicer it is to ride in
a cab than it is to walk?"
Ah, but cabs are complex! There are
few simplicities so easy or attainment
and so desirable in their elimination of
vulgar display as the pristine sim
plicity of hooflnp- it.
And of what complexity is the mat
ter of taking a girl to a theater? Should
her wishes be consulted or should he
buy tickets to a show which he wants
to see himself? When the tickets are
bought, should he bring it to her at
tention that they are costing him a
pretty penny, or should he casually re
mark that he has got a couple of tick
ets and will she pome? Should she
have the option of the aisle seat or
should he hog that desirable point of
vantage? Should he openly admire any
of the actresses or should he curl his
lip instead of Joining In the applause,
meanwhile looking at his girl and ex
changing disdainful glances with her?
When the ballet trips forth, should he
elevate himself in his seat and look
cheerful, or should he virtuously sigh
and keep his gaze discreetly lowered.
If she begins to look hungry, should he
dodge out between the acts and pawn
his ring to buy the coming dinner? And
when he comes back from this labor
"And the foolish woman thus tear
eth down her house with her own
hands."
All of which is not new; it hap
pened when the Proverbs of Solomon
were written. Even a corner in wheat
was heard of then, for there was "a
curse on him who withheld his corn,
but blessing upon him who sold it
at all times."
Do not alarm yourself, however.
No, the race is not lost. Frivolity has
its season, only it unfortunately abid
eth too longâtoo long if we esti
mate the loss to mankind at large
and to society in particular. Israel,
Judah and Rome before they fell suf
fered from the thoughtlessness of
their women, the frenzied rush for
maddening pleasure, the day of waste
ful recreation, the night of wild rev
elry. We, however, have benefited
by their example, and when the fad
has lasted a little too long and the
swift-moving life of to-day shall alter
cantico Hills are looking on with bated
breath.
Now, with two such foemeri âeach
worthy of the other's steelâit becomes
interesting to know what kind of men
they are. Mr. Rockefeller is, perhaps,
the better known of the two. When he
is driven along the old Sleepy Hollow
road that intersects the Bedford road
right at John Melin's groggery every
one has a good chance to study liis
external appearance. If the man were
walking along the road and wore
knickerbockers and broad, low shoes
with steel buckles to them, instead 'of
the conventional clothes of a modern
business man. you would swear that
the story about Ichabod Crane, who
a as supposed to have passed the best
days of his lifi in this very locality,
was not so much of a fiction as it
might be. Jn the face that one sees
there is a world of determination.
Some men give up when they have had

Jhe has lost that amount with a smile,
J and more than a dozen times he has
! made that amount while the day labor

I Among other things Mr. Lawson is
noted for is his beautiful homes. His

I Boston, is a palace. He has a half
j dozen beautiful farms, where his crack
j trotters graze. When he tires of one
j place he buys another,, for in this, as

i"is the spice of life.

of having gone out to get a drink,
should he deny it?
And thus complexities gather and
problems multiply. Young men, cut j
out the theater! If she wishes that '
sort of spectacular amusement, you j
would do well to learn a simple parlor '
trick or two that can be performed
with a few matches, a glass of water,
a cork, a coin, a wine glass and a pack
of cards. A pleasant and instructive
evening may be spent in this manner.
In the next place, restaurants must
be avoided. All restaurants are com
plex. Shall the gentleman precede the
lady when following the head waiter? |
How shall he refer to his escort when I
mentioning her to the waiter? Shall
he say "Give the lady another cup of
tea," or "Give madame another cup of
tea. or "Give my girl another cup of j
tea," or "Give the missis another cup
of tea," or "Give Mrs. Smith another
cup of tea," or "Give her another cup
of tea," or shall he basely dodge the
question and order "another cup of tea
over there"?
And, further, how may he attract the
waiter's attention when the waiter
studiously looks the other way? Shall
be hit his fork against his glass or
snap his fingers, or say "S-s-s!" or
once again the environments these
gayeties will pall upon their present
votaries and a soberer occupation will
be their quest. Those who have suf
ficient of the ruin left to make it
possible will repair the house they
have nigh wrecked and the neglected
husband and children will be made
happy in the warm stream of a
mother love.
We have even doubted the exist
ence of God before science became
fashionable, and faddists of all sorts
and conditions have formed fan
dangled sects long before the modern
craze. Even the merit of goodness
has had it doubters and uprightness
has been deemed folly. Corruption
in high places has held sway before,
and even human love has been de
rided. But we always come back to
the old again, the old that is true and
undying; to truth, to honor, to God
and home, in time to squeeze back
through the gates of salvation.

the lines that go to make up the Rock

characteristics. As for the inside, John
Melin himself says: "John D. Rocke
feller is too deep for me."
Jim Buck's Formula.
James W. Buck of Portland, Maine,
who says he is 75 years old and will
live to be a hundred, called on the
President the other day. Buck knew
Tom Reed when Reed was a boy. He
was well and hearty. He says he has a
medicine that will keep him alive for
twenty-five years. This is the form
ula:
"I buy one pound of Epsom salts
and add to this five tablespoonfuls of
sulphur and the juice of four large
lemons, dissolving the sulphur and
salts in the juice. Then I pour in about
a quart of distilled water or any other
kind of water. I nut this away in :i
bottle and when I feel a littfe poorly
I take some for a few days."
"I have discovered," he says, "that
man is simply a plant turned upside
down. Hair is to man what the roots
are to a plant. Air and light are the
soil from which mankind draws its
energy.
"The hair supplies the ether which is
the nutriment and energizer of the en
tire brain and nervous system. Under
standing this, it is easy to eradicate
consumption."
Beckham is a negro, born in South
Carolina and educated at Clafflin and
Howard universities. Leaving Howard
to enter Cornell, he fell ill of consump
tion.
In a Philadelphia hospital he noticed
that the hair of consumptives stopped
growing and turned gray at the tips;
so he concluded that this had some con
j nection with the origin of the dlseast.
He let his hair and beard grow, lived
j outdoors without a hat, recovered and
I to-day is a giant.
, cough In an aggravated sort of way, or
j shuffle his feet, or hiss "Waiter!" or
j quietly go over to the waiter and ask
him why the divvle he doesn't waif on
! this table over here properly? Which
part of |he steak should be served to
i the ladyâthe first or second cut?
: Should all the vegetables be dished out
at the first whack or should a little
be left in the vegetable dishes to look
polite? How much should the waiter
get? And if the waiter puts it in his
pocket without giving thanks should
the money be demanded back?
Horrible doubts and. perturbations!
'Tis thus that life is soured and death
| embraced with happy smiles. And
J simple is the remedy and easy is the
cure âto wit, a few sandwiches and
crullers in your pocket, and a draught
of limpid life-giving water at the hear
j est public fountain.
We have spoken. We have spoken.
Young men of the nation, ponder these,
our words of wisdom; ponder them
earnestly; ponder them well. And we
do hereby swear to you that if you
will but follow out the ideas so clearly
here laid down your courtship shall
come to a right happy end and you
shall be an example for the young and
the envy of the oldâa happy, contented

WATERLOGGED LAKME IS TOWED INTO PORT

The waterlogged steam schooner
Lakme was brought into port yesterday
by the tug Sea Rover, which took the

only parts of the Lakme above water.
â¢ In spite of heavy seas not a window in
the pilot-house is broken, and the jack
staff, the top of which appears above
water, is still in commission.
The Lakme struck on the bar when
leaving Eureka, broke her rudder and
tail shaft and damaged her stern. That
quite a hole was knocked in her stern
is thought likely, but being loaded with
lumber there was no danger of the
Lakme sinking. The North Fork start

proved beyond the North Fork's
strength, and the tug Sea Rover was

EXAMINATIONS
FOR OFFICERS
Last week the examination of officers
of the National Guard of California in
the jurisdiction of the Second Brigade
was actively begun before Colonel
Hayes of the Fifth Infantry and Cap
tain Margo, members of the examining
board. The officers examined were:
Lieutenant Colonel McCreagh of the
First Infantry and Lieutenant Colonel
Bush, Smith, Haven and Eggert. Mc-
Julliard of the Fifth, Majors Foulter,
Creagh and Eggert were for examina
tion as to their qualifications for the
position to which each was recently ad
vanced, and they as well as the others
were examined in everything from
definitions to and including advance
and rear guard work.
To each officer there was submitted
I a series of written questions, and each j
j was required to furnish a written re- \
l ply to every question. This was j
jan innovation in the matter of exam- |
; inations and it was found not so easy j
as answering orally, but at the explra- j
j tion of two hours and a half each of- j
| fleer handed in his signed answers and
j these will be considered by the board,
j It was an extraordinary task for some
of the officers and there are a number
who are very anxious to know if their
answers were correct. The answers .
must conform to the new drill regula- j
tions. which are different in many re- j
spects from those used in the past. j
Division Inspector Koster was pres
ent during the session, and at the close j
of the work was the host at a supper j
for the wearied officers.
Captain H. G. Mathewson, who for |
four years has been in command of
Company D, First Infantry, has been j
appointed adjutant of the First Infan
try by Colonel Filmer, vice John J. |
, West, who at his own request has been i
j placed on the retired list. Captain
| Mathewson has been in the guard since ,
i 18t<5 and served with the California |
I Volunteers in the Philippines.
Colonel Filmer will retain Captain j
j Choynski as quartermaster and Cap- I
i tain Adler as commissary of the regi- j
j ment; also Rev. J. P. McQuaide as j
I < haplain.
i The site at Glen Park for a shooting
| range has been accepted and it is being j
I put in condition for the troops. It will
be ready by the end of the current i
I month.
Cc-lonel Thomas F. O'Neil, Lieutenant :
I Colonel J. F. Connolly and Captain J. !
J. West, all of the First Infantry have, i
!at their personal request, been placed j
,on the retired list by order from head- ;
quarters. The order simply announces i
j the retirement and gives the service of j
! each, but does not say a word of praise
for the service these officers during a
! period of twenty years rendered to the
! State or for that which they rendered
ito the country while serving in the
Philippines. '
i More than three months ago the ar- J
i mory of Company G, Fifth Infantry, at
i Alameda, was destroyed by fire and the
j company lost all its equipment, which
las yet has not been replaced,
j Major Wilhelm, U. S. A., retired will *
i before the middle of the current month
; begin an inspection of the guard of
the State under instructions from the
War Department. It is not known
i whether an inspection will be held at
; the same time by the State inspector, i

SAYS IT BURNS
ALL GARBAGE
The Sanitary Reduction Works at j
Fifth and De Haro streets is working '
night and day to dispose of the accu- |
niulated garbage caused by the walk- j
ing out of the fifty men employed in the !
plant who refused to submit to the in- I
troduction of a time clock. The places
of the strikers have been filed with a
force of new men, and the heaps of
rubbish are rapidly disappearing.
Andrea Sbarboro, president of the
works, said yesterday that all the
garbage was being taken care of and
incinerated at the plant, and that the j
new men were satisfactorily filling the
places of the old hands.
Mounted police of Captain Spillane's j
command an? constantly on the alert J
to prevent the surreptitious dumping of !
rubbish around the plant by scaven- j
gers seeking to dispose of their cart- j
loads. In the vicinity of the works are |
heaps of rubbish .dumped there on the 1
day the scavengers were given permis- j
sion to do so, and these heaps Â»are ;
slowly rotting and Tilling the air with |
a stench that makes Chinatown smell i
sweet and clean in comparison.
The striking men are to be seen j
around the works and claim that not !
all the garbage in the city is being
burned. They say that only 60 per cent i
of the drivers are carting rubbish to >
the works, while the remaining 10 per
cent are dumping garbage in vacant
lots throughout the city. This is strenu
ously denied by the superintendent of
the works.
The men also assert that two nun- j
dred men are taking the place of the i
fifty strikers, in order to expedite the \
works, but that the reduced matter, .
dumped into the cars, which should j
v onsist of only, is filled with un
incinerated matter. They further allege
that owing to the employment of :n- ,
skilod men the garbage men are being
charged on an average of 40 c<*nts a
cubic yard, which is double the price
agreed to by the works.
Woman Bicyclist Knocked Down. i
Kate Anderson of 817 Van Ness
avenue, while guiding her bicycle j
along Polk street yesterday, was
knocked down by a northbound Polk- j
street car at Bush street crossing. Po
liceman O'Sullivan, who was a pas
senger on the car. had the young lady j
Sent to the Emergency Hospital,
where Dr. Kucich found that she was
suffering from a concussion of the !
brain and a deep lacerated wound on j
the left side of the head.

Cotton Market.
Th* New York wires of E. F. Hutton A Co.
esterdajr said:
"The cotton market is now more two-sided
. and aa a result of the wnek'e developments 1
speculativn sentiment is lean inclined to the >
beax side and in some quarters there has |
.' been a decided modification of extreme bear- I
â¢ isb views. It Is conceded that practically !
everything dependa upon th* spot position and I
the manner in which the South will hold on |
to supplies. Much will depend upon weather j
conditions during the next few months, and
if we are to have wet weather and a late
aprinar it will bring about a pronounced change |
in opinion with regard to the cotton market i
during the summer months and will stimulate i
buying of the summer options by investor* [
Â«n the ground that the probabilities oi a large 1
yield will be materially reduced. Many be
lieve that prices have already touched bot
tom."

evident In wheat at the opening. There was
a slight Improvement In quotations. May be

market here. Trading was more active dur
irg the last part of the session, shorts being
fsirly liberal purchasers. The market closed
at the highest point of the day, with May
at $1 15%.
The market for corn to-day showed more
strength than had been manifested for soma
time. Bull influences were firm cables and
small acceptances from the country. May
closed at 44% c. ,
Oats were quiet. May closed at 80%@31c.
Notwithstanding a fair demand for lard
from leading packers the provision market
was weak the greater part of the day. At
the close May pork wae off 10c, lard was down
6c and ribs were 2%c lower.

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEAT âThe week closed with an active
trade In futures with May %c lower and De
cember %c higher. The cash grain was steady
and unchanged.
The Chicago wires of E. F. Hutton 4 Co.
said:
' The market has again ruled dull, but very
strong, at no time showing the slightest hesi
tation. The advance, while slow, was per
sistent, the market closing at the hlghe3t
figures for at least three and a half months.
When we consider the small contract stocks
in all primary markets and milling centers,
the inability of the elevator people to convert
the low grades into contract Wheat, the fall
ing off In receipts in the Northwest and last
but not least, the large scattered short Inter
est, we can but feel out of sympathy with the
short side of the market. The long interest
is concentrated and well held by wealthy
people. They have this advantage to start
with, namely, paper profits on large lines. Vir
tually every short has a loss at the cloee to
night. To our mind the short interest is in
an uncomfortable position."
Minneapolis wired: "A large portion of
West receipts here at present is composed of
frosted and undesirable milling Wheat, which
makes It very difficult buyers to make
proper selections and at tne same time supply
their wants."
The Tribune says: "The repprted sale of
1.500,000 barrels of Flour by the Northwestern
millers has caused brisk activity in Wheat.
It is possible that Southwesstrn Flour buyers
thought they came nearer to getting a home
grown product by bringing spring Wheat pat
ent Flour from the Northwest."

The Potato market was unusually active for
Saturday and. although It was ,only a half
business day, fancy offerings were well cleaned
out of first hands at the cloee. fresh arrivals
of such etock being light. The best river stock
brought a slight advance and choice Burbanks
from the Coos Bay section of Southern Or-.-gon
readily comm-nded $1 25 per cental. Onions
; ruled weak at the old quotations,
i Southern vegetables were firm under oott
i tinued light receipts and a good demand and
' fresh offerings of String Beans. Egg Plant and
Green Peppers cleaned up quickly at higher
prices. Peas, Tomatoes and Summer Squash

Butter. Cheese and Eggs. j
Considerable divergence In the views of But
ter dealers was found yesterday, some houses
; being- firm holders and quoting 24c, while l
â¢ others, carrying large stocks, were weak and I
I offering their best creameries at 23c. and even <
' under, to large and close buyers. The result 1
was a confused condition of affairs. The qjuo
i tatlons below are about as close as can be ,'
I given under the circumstances. j 1
Cheese is easy and quiet at the decline re
cently noted. I
Eggs closed the week unchanged in price, but I
with a weak undertone, as usual at this time i
of the year. Some dealers reported accumu
! latlng stocks of ranch. The best demand at i
J the moment is for stare Eggs on account of i
| their relative cheapness and good quality. : I

the market but we doubt, considering the con- i

I aggregated 2263 bales. 2062 being for Boston
and 201 for New York. Collector Stratum says
that these consignments were forwarded under \
entry for Immediate transportation In bond I
i without appraisement at this port. The value
I was $193,076 and the duty at 11 cents pet
\ pound amounted to $85,115, which will be
! collected at Boston and New York, with no ;
| credit given to this port. Previous importa
j tions from Australia this season amounted to
1190 bales, valued at $81,748, duty $42,987.
All destined for Boston. The whole impor- ;
tations of wool from Australia last season
1 equaled only 2647 bales. The Sonoma and
, Ventura, following the SierrsJ will likely also
. bring large consignments of wool to be for- â  j
I warded to the East In bond.

, talned, however.

DISCOVERY OF SIXTH
NOON OF JUPITER.
Review of Work of Perrine'
DRAWING ILLUSTRATING THE SYSTEM OF JUPITER AND ITS MOONS, IN
CLUDING THE SIXTH SATELLITE RECENTLY DISCOVERED BY PROFES
SOR PERRINE OF LICK OBSERVATORY STAFF ON MOUNT HAMILTON.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Jan. 7.âThe following in
teresting account of the discovery of
the sixth satellite of Jupiter by Pro
fessor Perrine has been prepared by W.
W. Campbell, director of the Lick Ob
servatory on Mount Hamilton:
"MOUNT HAMILTON, Jan. 6.âThe
accompanying drawing will serve to
illustrate the system of Jupiter and its
moons, including the sixth moon, Just
discovered by Professor Perrine of the
Lick Observatory staff.
"For three years Professor Perrine's
programme of work has contemplated
a thorough search of the regions sur
rounding the planets of the solar sys
tem with a view to the discovery of
any unknown satellites. This work,
however, has been delayed pending the
replacing of the defective Crossley re
flector mounting with a suitable mod
ern structure, thanks mainly to the
generosity of Mrs. Phoebe A. Hearst.
This has been under way during the
past two years and was substantially
completed about six weeks ago. Photo
graphic observations of the region im
mediately west of Jupiter were ob
tained by Professor Perrine on Decem
ber 3, 8, 9 and 10. A comparison of the
plates made on successive nights
showed the presence of an unknown
body, which changed its positions as
indicated on the illustration under the
corresponding dates. The probabilities
were strongly in favor ( of its being a
satellite of Jupiter, but it was not im
possible that one of the numerous aste
roids in our system might at the time
be moving manner observed. The
lunar character of the object has just
been established by Professor Perrine
by means of photographs secured on
January 2, 3 and 4. These gave tp the
unknown body the positions indicated
on the corresponding dates.
"Tfte planet Jupiter, some 88.C00 miles
in diameter, is the central body in the
illustration. The first, second, third
and fourth satellites, discovered by
Galileo in 1610, follow the circular or
bits indicated by their numbers. These
satellites are very bright, being from
2100 to 3500 miles in diameter. The in
ner satellite, numbered V. was discov
ered by Professor Barnard with the
great Lick telescope in September, 1892.
It is approximately of the thirteenth
magnitude, is perhaps 100 miles in
diameter and revolves around the
planet in a period of 11 hours 57.4 min
utes. The outer Galilean satellite re
quires 16 days 17 hours to complete one
revolution. The distance of the sixth
satellite is as yet not definitely known,
inasmuch as the form and the positions
of its orbit cannot be determined until
observations covering at least two or
three months are at hand. However, its
diameter is probably of the order of 100
miles, and the period of one revolution
may be as long as six or eight months.
"The direction of the motion of the
new satellite appears to be opposite to
that of the others, but it is not impos
sible that a difference of a few degrees
in t-he position of its orbit may explain
the anomaly.
"W W. CAMPBELL, Director.'
MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE
IS DECLARED A FORGERY
Counsel for Captain Mulliken, Who Is
Being Tried by Courtmartlal,
Makes Startling Charge.
CHICAGO, Jan. 7.âlnvestigation as
to whether or not Captain David B.
Mulliken, Twenty-seventh Regiment,
was legally married in 1901 to a 20
--year-old Fillipino girl led to the charge
that an alleged* certified copy of the
marriage certificate is spurious.
"William A. Adams, civil counsel for
Mulliken, declared the document
"false, fraudulent and a forgery."
I Adams then produced another paper,
I which he said was the original certlft
' cate of Mulllken's marriage In March,
1901, to Reglna Batismo, daughter of j
a Filipino merchant. This original, it
j was asserted, had never been filed with j
the authorities In the town of Esca- â¢
lante, Occidental Negros, P. 1., accord- j
Ing to law, and the marriage therefore j
was invalid. Forgery of another mar- j
rlage certificate, it was charged, was j
restarted to by a Filipino Justice of the
Peace to shield himself from punish
ment for neglect of duty. This forgery,
it was asserted, was used against Mul
liken.
"We can show that cmc of the wit- !
nesses who signed this alleged certifi- j
cate was a cattle thief, an ex-convict
and not to be believed under oath,"
declared the defendant's attorney.
Miss Medora Cook, daughter of the
Rev. P. S. Henson of Tremont Temple,
Boston, has been elected professor of
singing in the London Royal College of
1 Music.
BEAUTY SPOT
AROUSES ENVY
Daisy Leiter, Now Wife of
Earl of Suffolk, Discards
Artistic Facial Decoration
Special Disnatch to The Call.
LONDON, Jan. ".âWhen Misa Daisy '
Leiter, now the wife of the Earl of j
Suffolk, was in England last time it !
was noticed that she had discarded the '
"beauty spot' she had affected so long
and which had excited so much curl- I
3sity among her feminine friends in j
Mayfair. The "spot" was much dis- I
cussed in London drawing-rooms at 1
that time. It was so beautifully done
that any money would have been paid
for another "spot" like it: but the
Countess was not short for a dollar or â :
two and she kept the secret. A pe
culiarity of this spot was that it never
remained stationary more than an hour
< r so. One day it was on one eide of
the face, moving about from one point
to another in pome mysterious manner,
out always producing the desired ef
fect. It would be transferred to the op
posite side the next day, and so on.' as
the caprice of its wearer dictated. The
mystery of thf moving "spot" caused
trouble at last. While aristocratic
maids and matrons of Mayfair and
Kelgravia were privileged to discuss it
freely, the servants at the "Priory" at
Reignte, where the Countess was stay
ing wiih her sister and brother-in-law.
Lord Curzon, were expected to be more
discreet. They giggled one day in her
hearing nbout the "spot." with tho re
suH that the "Priory" was that evening
minus half a dozen members of its do
mestic staff.
Motor driving by society women
promises to be the /craze of the next
London seitson, and there is every indi
cation that American women ;ire *n
ii.g to take a prominent part in it. The
latest among them to take lessons are
the Marchioness of Dufferin and young
Mrs. Bradley-Martin. Both have been
receiving instruction irom a well
known French expert in Paris and ex

Dangerous
dandruff
There is no denying the
fact that dandruff is
dangerousâ to the life and
vitality of the hair. It is
the outward manifestation
of an unhealthy condition
of the scalp, and if
neglected will surely result
in the loss of the hair, the
appearance of premature
old age and ultimate
baldness., Coke Dandruff
Cure not only quickly
removes every trace of
dandruff from the scalp,
but positively prevents its
recurrence. It is a
delightfully refreshing
tonic, without a trace of
sulphur or any injurious
ingredients, and when
faithfully used has proved
its ability over and over
again to produce a heavy,
luxuriant growth of hair
where all other remedies
and formulas have failed.
Thin, brittle and poor hair,
therefore, need no longer
bp a source of mortification
to any one. What Coke
Dandruff Cure has done
for thousands it can and
will do for you. Your
drugeist will tell you the
same story. Get a bottle
to-day and try it.

SKILLED (HAI FIEIR.
In Louden the Marchioness had les
sens in the mÂ« hanlcal part at the au
tomobile school in Mayfair. and it is
said tjhat she now understands every )
detail in the construction of her car.
The Mi'.rchioness is of a very nervous j
temperament, and it was some time j
before i=he cou'd command sufficient j
courage to take a spin in a car even I
when accompanied by her husband. All j
this nervousness is now worn off. and !
she promises to become one of the most
accomplished drivers .in Great Britain, i
Young Bradley-Martin is an expert }
driver. so that his bride j can ;
always have instruction ready at !
hand. At the school she would not j
learn the mechanical- part of the work,
contending that it was a man's and
not a woman's work. "When I drive
a car," she said, "I shall have a chauf
feur to do anything mechanical that is
meded." ;
The keen personal interest which the
Duchess of Marlborough takes in the j
Children's Hospital, Great Ormond ;
street, was shown by the fact that j
when a violent gas explosion took place i
in the immediate neighborhood of the ;
hospital a few days ago she was the
first to send a message of inquiry re
garding the safety of the Institution
and the children and nurses housed
there. This hospital Is one of the chief
objects of her charitable attention, and
when there is anything needed to add
to the comfort or the enj<syment o%the
little ones confined there vhe no
ways be depended on to render sub
stantial aid. Every Christmas she sends
flowers and evergreens, with Wsiich the
sick rooms and dormitories ar& deco
rated.
POOR OFFICER'S CHANCE.
Consternation has been caused In
"upper tendom" by the announcement
that the army council has decided to
enforce drastic measures to stop the
extravagance which practically re
-1 atricts commissions in cavalry regi
| ments to men with large private means, i
i This means that this branch of the |
service will no longer be officered ex
! clusively by the scions of wealthy
I houses and blue-blooded young arislo-
I crats will have to submit to the hu
i miliation of plebeian association and
! competition. And, worse than that, as
' the result of giving free play lat
] ter they will be distanced by youths
| who, having no fortunes of their own,
| will seek promotion and increased pay
by taking their profession seriously, in-
I stead of devoting themselves to cards
; and sports and other means of getting
! a good time out of life.
The aristocratic officers have brought
it on themselves. For a long time they
| have had things all their own way in
these crack regiments, commissions in
; which have been regarded as their spe-
I cial perquisites. They have been tried
: and found wantingâwanting in brains.
| For their accommodation and encour
| agement the educational standard was
â  considerably reduced, and still there
| were not enough of them capable of
1 passing these easy tests to fill the va
! cancies, of which there are now thirty
j three for officers of the cavalry of the
; line. So the fiat has gone forth, the
â¢ doors are to be thrown open and the
j man who has to live on his pay is to be
given a fair chance. And meanwhile
the pets of society are to be denied the
I solace of making a splurge with their
I cash in the regimental messes. Sympa-
I thetic Mayfair echoes their opinion that
it is a "beastly shame."

POLICE SEARCH FOR
MISSING GIRL.
ToungflaroaretSealsDroDsFromSigfii:
Margaret Seals, a fourteen-year-old
girl, whose home is at 235 A Langton
street, has disappeared and up to a
late hour last night the detective had
found no trace of her. The last seen of
her was at 3:45 o'clock Friday after
noon, when she left the fruit store on
Fourth street, near Folsom, where she
was employed, saying that she wanted
to go home for a few minutes.
Her employer, .a Greek named D.
Liapis, says the girl asked him for
$2 on account of her wages Friday af
ternoon, representing that her mother
wanted the money to pay her rent.
He complied with the request and then
she asked to be allowed to have from
4to 5 o'clock to take the $2 home. She
did not return and at 9 o'clock that
night the anxious parents came to
make inquiry about their daughter,
whom they had not seen since noon.
The police were notified yesterday
and the parents and Liapis were in
consultation last evening with Captain
Burnett of the detective bureau. The
parents fear the girl has met with foul
play, but the detectives are convinced
that she has run away from home. It
was learned that Margaret had com
plained that her mother beat her often
and made home unhappy for her. She
declared that selling fruit was very
distasteful to her and she did it only
because her mother compelled her to
work.
Mrs. Seals explains that she did not
ask her daughter to bring home $2 for
the rent payment. It is thought that
Margaret adopted this ruse to get what
little money she could preparatory to
running away. Her wages were 15 a
week.
The girl is known to have frequently
met young men. She did this clan
destinely, she told a friend, because her
mother would always give her a beat
ing for what the maternal law held to
be misconduct.
For a while yesterday the Police De
partment was excited over the case
and, as- usual, suggestions were made
of a repetition of the Xorah Fuller
murder. But Investigation resulted In
clearing everybody of suspicion.
The Seals family came from British
Columbia some time ago. The girl was
employed for a time as a wrapper at
the Emporium.
GOOD BEEF FROM CROSS
OF BISON WITH CATTLE
British Stock Grower Pleased With
the Result of His Experi
ment.
EpÂ»ciÂ») Cable to The Call and New York
Herald. Copyright, 1905, by the New York
Her&id Publishing Company.
LONDON, Jan. 7.âFor some time
Mr. Ley land of Haggerston Castle has
been experimenting with a cross of
the North North American bison and
various types of British bred cattle.
His idea is to provide a variant of
British beef.
The first two of these animals sent
to the market were a cross between
the bison and a highland variety,
which has just arrived at Newcastle.
The animals had grown to maturity in
wild state and much resembled their
American ancestors, clothed with the
black, shaggy coat pf the true bison,
with his splendid horns and shoulders.
Great difficulty was experienced in
getting the animals to Newcastle, as
they were wild and fierce. One had
to be shot in its box.
When skinned and cut up it ap
peared that the beef was very rich and
â¢of better quality than the ordinary.

PURE FOOD
BILL WILL
IT PiSS
Whisky Rectifiers
Charged With
Its Defeat.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU. POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON, Jan. 7.âFriends of
the pure food hill passed by the House
and now pending in the Senate, es
pecially members of the International
Pure Food Congress, believe that the
whisky rectifiers of the country have
killed the measure, so far as the pres
ent session Is concerned. As a conse
quence they are coming to this city
to see what can be dons in the way of
resurrection.
H. H. Allen of Kentucky, secretary of
the Pure Food Congress, arrived In
Washington tc-day to appear before
a committee of Congress and present
to Senators and Representatives reso
lutions in favor of the passage of the
present bill.
Tt is asserted that a tremendous lob
by, representing the whisky rectifiers
of the country, who, according to Dr.
H. W. Wiley, produce 85 per cent of
the ordinary whisky of American com
merce, has been on the ground ever
since the session begun. The Pure
Food Congress took a decided stand In
favor of bottling whisky in bond, and
the bill now pending is opposed by the
rectifiers because they would be com
pelled to label their product as adul
terated whisky and then offer it for sale
at hotels, clubs and bars.
BRITISH COLUMBIA BARS
LONGFELLOW'S "EVANGELINE"
Beautiful Poem Banished From the
Schools Because of Its Anti-
British Spirit.
TORONTO. Ontario. Jan. 7.âLong
fellow's "Evangeline" has been ban
ished from the British Columbia
schools. Two reasons are given for
this treatment of the unhappy
Evangeline. One is that the poem is
tainted with anti-British spirit and the
other that, although it is a beautiful
and highly moral production, it is be
coming stale to the teachers from long
use.
Lamb's "Tales From Shakespeare"
also are to be cut out of the school

DENVER. Jan. ".âAlva Adams was ;
to-night declared by the Legislature to
be the duly elected Governor of Colo
rado. The returns showed Adams 123,
--078, Peabody 113,304; plurality for
Adams, 9774.
A che*v greeted the announcement of
the result of the election when made
by Lieutenant Governor Heggott.
The Republican candidates to all the
Other State offices were declared elect
ed. Under the terms of the agreement [
reached to-day by the various factions
in the Legislature no notice of contest ;
can be filed by Governor Peabody un
til after the inauguration of Adams,
which is set for 10 o'clock Tuesday
morning. It has not yet been definitely i
decided by Governor Peabody whether
he will make a contest.
DOVE OF PEACE.
When the Legislature convened this
morning Representative William Grif
fith of Cripple Creek asked for a recess
until 4 o'clock in the afternoon, giving
â a his reason for the request that "the
white-winged dove of peace is about to t
light on the dome of the Capitol." It was
nine long hours before the dove came
down, and many and devious had been
her flights before It reached its perch.
It was finally agreed at 5 o'clock in the
afternoon that the vote should be can- ;
vassed, that Alva Adams should be de
flared Governor and that no contest 'â â 
should be made for any office until
after his inauguration at 10 o'clock
next Tuesday morning.
Throughout the entire struggle for
the Governorship the chief aim of both
Democrats and Republicans has been
to secure the appointment of the two
new Judges to the Supreme Court. The
Wolcott Republicans were insistent in
their demand that they be recognized
in the appointment of the Judges, and
it was finally agreed that the ap
pointees should be George W. Bailey of
Fort Collins and L. M. Goddard of Den
ver. The Wolcott men made a strong
fight for Judge M. E. Lewis of Colo
rado Springs, whom they preferred to
Goddard, but they finally gave way.
PEABODY INDIGNANT.
When the Republican leaders called
upon Governor Peabody to inform him
of the conclusions they had reached
and to tell him that his only hope of a
second term lay through a contest in
the Republican Legislature they were
met by a wrathful and indignant man.
It was only the personal pleadings of
some of his closest friends that finally
induced him to agree to the plan pro
posed and to send the names of Bailey
and Goddard to the Senate for con
firmation.
The Peabody men refused to give
way until the Supreme Court this aft
ernoon refused to declare legal the pro
ceedings of yesterday. It would not de
clare them Illegal, simply declining to
pass on the" matter at all. With the
Joint session not declared legal all
things that came from it were In the
same position, and the Peabody men
then agreed to compromise.
The Senators filed into the House,
with Lieutenant Governor Haggott
leading The Lieutenant Governor
mounted the Speaker's rostrum, where
Speaker Dickson was awaiting him.
The men eyed each other for a second
and then Haggott, with a laugh, ex
tended his hand and it was cordially
grasped. The Speaker stepped back
and the Lieutenant Governor called the
session to order. He announced the
purpose of the joint session to be the
canvassing of the vote, and then gave
way to the Speaker.
COURT ORDER MADE
The Supreme Court this afternoon di
rected the Commissioners to deliver the
ballot boxes to the commltte, with the
understanding that a representative of
the commission be present when they
are opened.
When the court convened at 2 o'clock
Chief Justice Gabbert announced thatl
the Election Commissioners were prop
erly officers of the court and as such it'
was their duty to turn over to the!
legislative committee the ballot boxes i
used at the last election, and he would â¢
therefore issue an order to that effect.
Jutice Gabbert declined to make a rul
j ing concerning the legality of yester
day's proceedings in the House. This
was a disappointment to the Peabody
, Republicans, who had hoped for a de
; clsion upholding the legality of the pro
ceedings.
Although the court had given Sen
ator Patterson until 2 o'clock to pre
pare his answer to the petition, it an
nounced the decision without affording
i him time to speak. He expressed him
self as surprised at the action of the
court and asked for leave to file a de
murrer. It was refused, and the court
directed the clerk to enter the order.

ROME. Jan. 7.âOne of the most Im

of Pope Pius X has been embodied in a
secret bull, the text of which will not
be made public until the Pontiff is dead,
when it will be read as forming part
of the constitution in the next conclave
that wiil elect Pope Pius' successor.
The bull is in connection with the
claims- of Austria. France and Spain
as to their right to veto the election of ]
any Cardinal to the papacy. Not all
the Cardinals have been informed as
to the contents of the document, it hav
ing been drawn up in accordance with
a decision reached by the Cardinals liv
ing in Rome with the exception of Car
dinal Rampolla, who is absent from the
city.
Briefly, the bull says that all Cardin
als are absolutely forbidden under pen
alty of exclusion from the conclave
and not beuig allowed to vote to be the
bearer of a message of veto, and that if
any Cardinal, knowing the intention of
his ruler to object to the election of a
Cardinal, communicates this intention
to his colleagues in the conclave he also
will be excluded and not allowed to
vote.

; that he was going to Washington at
i once to confer with the Attorney Gen
| eral regarding the prosecution of the
Amalgamated Copper Company under
the interstate commerce and anti-trust
laws. Lawson refuses to state what ac
tion will be taken, but admits that he
will present certain evidence against
the Amalgamated which will make
prosecution by Moody practically cer
tain. The wires have been laid for
some time, and Senator Stone of Mis
souri paved the way by opening up the
question of money spent by Standard
Oil in the Bryan campaign.
"I received in my mail this morning,"
said Lawson, "268 letters from all over
the country from people who said that
they would not go into the market with
their January dividends until conditions
were decidedly changed. Walt a day or
two and see something happen."

NEW YORK, Jan. 7.â"But I mar
ried only three wives," said Adam
Czupak when he pleaded guilty to a
charge of bigamy before Magistrate
Baker.
The police said that Czupak gave
each of his helpmates to understand
that he was searching for work In the
country. He would visit each wife for
a day or two every week and get from
her what money he could. The three
in this manner kept him in good
clothes and spending money.
Wife No. 1 was Katie Smalce. She
lives In Brooklyn and has one child.
Wife No. 2 waa Maria Obuskiwlcz.
She lives In Jersey City. The third
wife was Antonla Prustowskl of this
city. Like the other two, she works
for a living.
Czupak's system worked smoothly
until a few days ago, when wife No. 3
became suspicious and enlisted the
services of a notary public, who lo
cated wife No. 1 in Brooklyn. Magis
trate Baker issued the warrant.

Twenty Thousand Cacturefl Russians Will Be
Housed Near the Cltu of Kure. â¢
TOKIO, Jan. B.âlt is understood that
the Sanyo Railway has been instructed
to make preparations to transport 20,000
Russian prisoners from Shimonoseki to
Kure. It is probable that the prisoners
will be quartered near Kure. The more
seriously sick and wounded will be left
in the field hospitals at Port Arthur for
the present. Those capable of heing
moved will be brought to Japan when
arrangements for housing them have
been completed.
TOKIO, Jan. 7.âGeneral Nogi reports
the following additional transfer of
prisoners at Port Arthur, made yester
day, January 6:
Twenty-seventh Rifle Regiment (ad
ditional), 1000 men.
Twenty-eighth Rifles, 52 officers, 1505
men.
Seventh Battalion reserve (con
scripts), 14 officers, 282 men.
Third Battalion reserve (conscripts),
12 officers. 208 men.
Tenth Regimental headquarters, 2
officers, 66 men.
Eleventh and Twelfth (mixed) Regi
ment, Third Division, 4 officers, 195
men.
Fourth Artillery Brigade, 26 officers,
901 men.
Garrison Artillery, 2 officers, 113 men.
Kwangtung Garrison Artillery, 6S
officers, 2783 men.
Gendarmes. 2 officers, 24 men.
Total, 182 officers, 7177 men.
One hundred and fifty-one officers
were paroled.
In naval circles here the recall of the
second Pacific squadron is not re
garded as a sign that Russia does not
hope for final success on the seas. It
is considered that the authorities in
St. Petersburg have realized the im
probability of the second Pacific
squadron alone defeating Vice Admiral
Togo and has recalled it to await rein
forcements and to further train its
officers and men, preparatory to a su
preme effort for the mastery. A naval
officer said to-day:
"Japan has confidently awaited the
arrival of the second Pacific squadron
of the Russian navy in the Far East.
It would have been a splendid fight.
Now we must prepare for the future,
of which we are not afraid."
A celebration at Hlbiya Park to-day,
under the auspices of the Tokio mu
nicipality, ended the week's jubilation
begun upon the return of Vice Admiral
Togo from the front. There were
speechmaklng and fireworks, and the.
students and merchant guilds paraded
the streets, which were gay with flags
and lanterns.
Five hundred of the wounded men
from Port Arthur were permitted to
leave the hospitals and were feted at
the Imperial Hotel.
Rear Admiral Kataoka, in his report
received yesterday, says that the com
manders of the flotillas sent to Kiao
chau and Chefu have returned, satis
fied that the German and Chinese au
thorities have completely disarmed the
Russian vessels which sought refuge in
those ports.
FOCK AMONG THE SLAIN.
Report of the Gallant General's Death
at Last Confirmed.
MUKDEN, Friday, Jan. 6.âThough
the news of Port Arthur's capitulation j
was first generally known here to-day,
it was surmised by the Russian army
on January 4 from the cheering heard
in the Japanese camp along the entire
line. The news created no surprise, be
cause the army had become accustomed
to the possibility of Port Arthur's fall i
before the battle of Liaoyang and since, j
While concerned over the disaster, the j
Russians are lost in admiration of the j
wonderful and unexampled defense. j
Although the deaths of Generals Fock
were not published
here, the facts regarding Fock had
been accepted for six weeks and the
condition of Port Arthur was known
throughout. The authorities here as
early as December 25 denied that relief
vessels had successfully run the block
ade, as reported, and candidly admitted
the desperation of the heroic defenders.
The Russians regarded the prediction

GREAT NAVY FOR RUSSIA.
Experts Will Meet In Paris to Discuss
Building Plans.
PARIS. Jan. 7.âVice Admiral Dou
bassoff. who succeeded Admiral Kaz
na-koff a? Russian representative on
the International North Sea Commis
sion, arrived here to-day and was re
ceived by Foreign Minister Delcasse.
It is known that his service on the
North Sea Commission is a mere in
cident, his chief mission being to pre
side at the meeting of the naval tech
nical commission, which is considering
the complete rehabilitation of the Rus
sian navy. This is not connected with
the fall of Port Arthur or with the
present war, as the Russians recognize
the necessity of recruiting their navy
without reference to the contest with
Japan. Therefore, Dolgeroukoff, Por
ectkine, Brlncke and other naval ex
perts have arrived here after visiting
the shipyards of Europe for the pur
pose of learning their capacity for the
execution of an extensive programme
for naval construction. Admiral Dou
bassoff will preside at the meeting of
experts and go over the reports.
It is understood that the Russian
programme contemplates the expendi
ture of $200,000,000 during the next
three years In naval rehabilitation.
The meeting of the experts leads to a
coincidental gathering of the repre
sentatives of the leading shipyards, in
cluding the American yards.

J. W. Brown, a Dcs Moines wholesale
produce merchant, describes the sequel
to th* story concerning the cabbage
snake.
Some one started a yarn to the effect
that a small worm or snake was con
cealed in many cabbages on th* market,
and as a result cabbages are rotting in
the produce cellars. People are afraid
to buy them. It is estimated that there
are at least 110.000 worth of cabbages
in Dcs Moines which no dne will pur

age caused by the story throughout
the nation will be not less than $5,000,000.

bage raisers declare they would give
a big reward for the punishment of the
cabbage snake liar if punishment were
possible.

FIGHT FOR TOGA
IS BEING WAGED
WITH MORE VIGOR
Political Agents of
Southern Pacific
Are Active.
OPPOSED TO BARD
Railroad Hirelings
Aim to Defeat
Ventura Man.
"I will pay $50 to any Assemblyman
who will tell me that Jere Burke or
John C. Lynch, since last Saturday
night, has asked him to vote for
Flint," remarked Judge Dibble last
night at the Palace Hotel. George
Knight, seated alongside of Dibble, at
once exclaimed: "I will make it
$260."
"Does this qffer apply to Walter
Parker?"
"No," replied Knight and Dibble.
It was explained that Herrin had
not called off Parker, the leader of
the Flint forces in the south. The in
formation is also given out that Jim
Gillls of Sacramento has a free hand
and Gillis Is working as actively for
Knight as Parker is for Flint. John
McKenzie, Harbor Commissioner, is
classed among the eliminated.
It appears that Parker, the political
agent of the Southern Pacific in Los
Angeles, obtained from Herrin au
thority to get into the fight for Flint
before George Knight projected him
self into the Senatorial arena and de
spite all of the roaring of the orator
Herrin refused to call off Parker, but
Burke and Lynch were told to go to
the rear with the non-combatants.
In Sacramento Jim Gillis, State Li
brarian, is the only "turtle in the
railroad pond." He is not amenable to
the orders of Jere Burke, Walter Park
er, John C. Lynch or John McKenzie.
He deals directly with Herrin. On
lookers take note of the fact that all
the railroad workers have special dis
pensation from Herrin to work against
Bard, hence Burke, Lynch and McKen
zie, while not allowed to express an
open preference for either Knight or
Flint, are given full license to vent
their pent up indignation on Bard.
Arthur Flsk understands that the
"hands off" order from railroad head
quarters applies to his own candidacy
for the. United States Senate.
"Certainly, I expect Herrin will keep
"hands off" my fight. The strength of
my support will be a.surprise. If prom
ises of support on the first ballot are
made good I will consider the fight
open and will then take off my coat
and go to the bat. I hear that Mr.
Knight complains that I am taking
votes that would go to him if I were
not a candidate. The facts are that 1
am getting more votes from Flint and
more from Bard than I am getting
from Knight. I have received many
voluntary assurances of support from
members of the Legislature with whom
I am well acquainted. They tell me
frankly and without solicitation on my
part that they will vote for me. Yes,
Senator Wolfe, in whose Senatorial dis
trict I reside, will place me in nomina
tion in the Senate and Fred C. Jones,
who represents, in the other House,
the Thirty-seventh District, will make
the principal nominating speech In my
behalf in the Assembly. My course will
be guided In a sense by the develop
ments of the first ballot."
Postmaster Flsk met many members
of the Legislature at the Palace court
yesterday. The Knight forces are
somewhat uneasy over the formidable
aspect of the Fisk candidacy, but
Judge Dibble, Senators Ralston and
Leavitt and others are claiming that
Knight's strength is constantly in
creasing and that the natural gravita
tion of the great majority of unpledged
Senators and Assemblymen will bring
about Knight's election on the third or
fourth ballot in joint convention.
Supporters of Arthur Flsk assert that
the Postmaster will lead Knight on
the first ballot and that his strength
will Increase as the balloting pro
gresses. Statesmen are beginning to
speculate on the probability of two
gold bricks, one for Knight and one
for Flint and each brlcx a thing of
glided beauty.
"Arthur Fisk will get twenty votes
on the first ballot," remarked a Flsk
boomer at the Palace Hotel last night.
The boomer placed Knight's strength
on the first ballot at fifteen.
The forces supporting Frank P. Flint
displayed remarkable activity yester
day. In the Flint camp the depression
caused by Knight's capture of the Sac
ramento delegation is vanishing. It is
possible that Walter Parker, while Her
rin is off with both feet, both hands
and both eyes, will turn a trick on Jim
Gillis and land the Sacramento bunch
back in Flint's camp.
In rooms on the fourth floor of'the
Palace the Flint men assembled yes
terday and discussed the asDects of
the campaign. Parker was the busi
est and most effective of the outside
workers. It was noted that he was
cheerful and confident. He would
rather have Herrin's active support of
Flint's candidacy than the "hands
off" programme. Parker Is working
overtime and George Knight would
be happy if Herrin would advise the
Los Angeles representative of the'
Southern Pacific to take a rest.
The question Is frequently asked,
"What wlll.Ruef do with his bunch of
statesmen In the Legislature?" Neither
Senator George Keane nor Speaker Pro
, Tern. T. S. Atkinson can give the cor
| rect tip at this time. The Huef strength
:is placed at ten votes. It is conjectured
j that these votes will be cast for J. O.
Hayes, Eugene E. Schmitz or Ruef
himself at the outset. Later on, when
the combat deepens, one of the candi
dates frem the fcouth may receive help.
Among the on-lockers at the Palace
yesterday were Thomas Hughes, R. J.
Wade, Oscar Lawlor and John Mitchell,
Los Angeles; Congressman-elect S. C.
Smith, Eighth District; General George
Stone, Stephen T. Gage v M. F. Tarpey.
George Hatton, Charles J. Heggerty
and Henry C. Dibble.
At a late hour last night Thomas
Hughes and Frank Brandon of the
Bard forces were not able to state defl
j nitely when Senator Bard would ar
rive In Sacramento.
It Is the judgment of several well
informed politicians that Flint, Knight
and Flsk are underestimating Bard's
strength. It is the general gossip
that Flint on the first ballot will get
more votes than any other candidate,
j but Bard will receive the support of
; Assemblymen who are now claimed
I for Flint and also some votes that are
I claimed for Knight. The number of
I Senators and Assemblymen who will
refuse to wear the railroad collar may
ii.crease. The remark was made yes
terday: "What a splendid triumph
it would be for the Republican party
of California if the Legislature should
refuse to elect any candidate on the
Southern Pacific programme"
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 8, 1905.
Legislators Devote
Day to Hunting
on Marshes.
PURSUE MALLARDS
Some Amendments
to Game Laws in
Preparation.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 7.âA1l the
Senatorial candidates who have been
here during the. week having changed
their field of battle to San Francisco
until to-morrow, the legislators and
"friends of candidates" who did not
also go to the bay are finding such
amusement to-day as they can. Duck
hunting is supplying the principal en
tertainment, 'the importance even of
a candidate for the United States Sen
ate becomes a small thing to a legisla
tor of sportsmanlike proclivities in
comparison with the pursuit of mal
lards and canvasbacks and aspirants
for the toga who. may fill a position of
some magnitude In the minds of those
legislators in the city of Sacramento
are forgotten entirely amid the whirr
of wings and crack of guns in the
tuies. Who Herrin is going to give the
word for or how many men Prescott
may be able to whip into line for Flint
through committee appointments are
subjects that fly the legislator's
mind when he reaches the hunting
ground. Â£
As a result of to-day's shoot and
that of to-morrow morning there will
be many a duck dinner in Sacramento;
after that the Senatorial aspirants
will again assume their position of
commanding importance and '.their
chances of election will once more
receive attention.
The game laws will be up again for
revision at this session and several
making amendments to those !
adopted at the last session and adding
new features are being framed. Few
matters of legislation are more prolific
of wrangling pertaining to
wild game. Sportsmen in every sec
tion of the State are interested in it
and nearly every section wants some- I
thing different because of different I
conditions. It generally takes days
to effect an adjustment that is reas- j
onably satisfactory to ail.
One of the principal fights this ses- i
sion is expected on a proposition to j
reduce the bag limit.of ducks to twen
ty-five. The San Francisco sports
men favor this and many of those or ;
the interior wish it left where it is. j
The annual pall of fog that settles
over Sacramento about the sea
son ths*ditaÂ»J*Â» Legislature Is in ses- 1
sion is ii- gflrftlrtfe-of the sun !
would be about as gratifying to the
aver?"e citizen as the sight of a Sena- â 
toria. sack to the legislator who com- j
bines thrift with statesmanship.
Housewives who rent rooms in Sacra- 1
mento are wondering why, with the
several hundred attaches who have
been added to the list of those having
real business in the city during the ses
sion, there Is not a waiting line In front
of every door bearing a "rooms to let" |
sign. Housewives never did understand
much about the work done for their
country's weal and the guiding of the
glorious ship of state. The shameful
condition of men drawing a per diem j
from the State who do not visit Sacra
mento more than once during the ses- j
sion is even worse than it was last
year. Some of the attaches who haven't ,
any particular duties here, but no busi- j
nes elsewhere, are remaining* but the â 
most of those who were given jobs
merely that they might be paid so
much money from the State treasury I
as a reward for political fealty to some
candidate do not even pretend to re- j
side here. Some who are new at the j
business of taking money from the State ;
that they do not earn are scurrying
around trying to find out what work
Is expected of them, being fearful that
If they don't get connected somewhere
they will be dropped from the roll.
These will soon get wise and go home
to enjoy the fruits of official but none
the less despicable and yiegal looting I
of the taxpayers' funds.
An effort is to be made to Increase j
the fees of trial jurors from $2 to $3 a 1
day. Assemblyman Rolley will be the 1
father of a measure raising the Bti- j
pend. He says that In the interior men
have to leave their homes sometimes to
serve on Juries and he believes they j
should be paid a higher fee.
County school boards will be Inter- >
ested in a bill to be Introduced by Sen- j

THE VALUE OF CHARCOAL. .
Few People Know How Useful It Is
in Preserving Health and Beauty.
Nearly everybody knows that char
coal is the safest and most efficient
disinfectant and purifier in nature, but
few realise its value when taken into i
the human system for the same cleans
ing puroose.
Charcoal. Is a remedy that the more
you take of It the better; It is not a
drug at all, but simply absorbs the '
gases and impurities always present In â¢
the stomach and intestines and carries
them out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after
smoking, drinking or after eating
oniops and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and Im
prover the complexion, it whitens the
teeth and further acts as a natural and
eminently safe cathartic.
It absorbs the Injurious gases which
collect in the Btomach and bowels; it
disinfects the mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh.
All druggists pell charcoal in one
form or another, but probably the best
charcoal and the most for the money
Is In Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges; they
are composed of the finest powdered
Willow charcoal, and other harmless
antiseptics In tablet form or rather in
the form of large, pleasant tasting los
enges, the charcoal being mixed with
honey.
The daily use of these loaenges will
soon tell In a much Improved condition
of the general health, better complex
ion, sweeter breath and purer blood,
and the beauty of It Is, that no possible
harm can result from their continued
use. but on the contrary, great benefit. \
A Buffalo physician in speaking of
the benefits of charcoal, says: ad
vise Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges to all
patients suffering from gas in atom- j
ach and bowels, and to clear the cam- '
plexion and purify the breath, mouth
and throat; I also believe the liver is
greatly benefited by the dally use of
them; they cost but 25 cents a box at ,
drug stores, and although in some sense
a patent preparation, yet I believe I
get more and better charcoal in Stuart's j
Charcoal Lozenges than in any of the
ordinary charcoal tablets."

WANTS TERMINAL FACILITIES.
Western Pacific Railroad Will Appeal
to the I-iCglslature.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 7.âDuring the
absence of the Senatorial candidates
the legislators that remained here have
been devoting considerable time to a
discussion of what they consider the
next Important question to be taken
upâthe petition of the Western Pa
cific for terminal facilities somewhere
along the water front of San Francis
co, Attorney Bartnett of San Francis
co, who represents the company, has
nut as yet appeared in Sacramento on
behalf of the measure, but It is ex
pected <that he will come as soon as
the senatorial fight is disposed of.
It was given out that the Western
Pacific Is determined to secure the
terminal and will make an appeal to
the people for moral support to hasten
legislative action, pointing out that the
greater the railroad competition in
California the greater will be the bene
fit accruing to the people.
Any opposition that may arise to the
Western Pacific measure, it is said, will
come from legislators who hold that
the Wesfern Pacific should actually
begin construction through the Sierra
Nevada pass, toward tide water before
it asks for terminal facilities. On the
other hand, however, it is said that the
Western Pacific would display poor
business Judgment if It did begin out
laying money before It was assured
terminal facilities that would permit of
the completion of the road without
danger of endless complications and
litigation. Just who will present the
Western Pacific bills In the two houses
has not as yet been determined.
Assemblymen here are betting even
"money that Speaker Prescott will not
be ready Monday to anounce commit
tees. He is hard at work in a room,
the location of which Is known only to
a few and is seen little about the hotel
lobbies. Among his advisers are said
.to be several Flint men from the south.

i
j Distinguished Colleagues of
California's Junior Senator
Pay Him High Compliment
Special Dispatch to The Gall.
' WASHINGTON, Jan. 7.âSenator I
j Beverldge of Indiana, chairman of the \
Senate Committee on Territories, in j
charge of the statehood bill, and bit- j
terly opposed to Bard's position, to- 1
j day said:
"Senator Bard made one of the most |
admirable speeches It has been my I
pleasure to hear since I have been in |
th< Senate. He surprised every one
with the compactness and simplicity i
Sof his argument and with the com- j
bined grace and force of his diction. |
He also surprised and pleased us all j
with the attractive manner of his de
livery.
"Senator Bard long ago won my con
i fldence and regard by his unusual qual-
I ities of mind and character. And as our j
years of service In the Senate have
pa 11 fill along 1 have noted with gratifi
cation the development and qualities |
of statesmanship which will make him
as useful and successful in the higher j
plane of public affairs as he has been j
in the business world, to which hitherto I
he devoted his energies. In saying this
I think I express the feeling of his col- j
leagues In the Senate, and none more
than those who differ with him upon j
the subject of his excellent address of
yesterday."
Senator Perkins said: "Senator Bard's
speech was a splendid effort. I heard it
all and I am convinced his position Is j
correct. I believe that the position he j
has taken and maintained with such
marked ability is for the best interests
of New Mexico, for the best Interests of |
Arizona and for the best interests of i
California. I am proud of Senator j
Bard."
Hon. B. A. Fowler of Phoenix. Aris..
said: "That was a masterly effort, of
Senator Bard's. His honest, conserva
tive, judicial treatment ot the subiect
made a profound Impression. A Sen
ate official told me that In his experi
ence of twenty years he had never seen
closer attention or greater courtesy
\ shown any Senator on the floor of the
â  chamber. Senator Bard's earnestness
was convincing, his logic unanswer
j able, and several Senators admitted
! they were convinced of the soundness
I and Justice of his position."
Many Washington newspaper corre
j spondents listened to Senator Bard's
I speech, and these men, who gazette
I everything with cool and calculating
eyes, to-day in their conversation Daid

Failure to Appear of the

TONE OF INDIFFERENCE
Fall of Port Arthur and De

ties Case Cause a Spurt
NEW YORK, Jan. 7.âPrices of stocks
were Inclined to yield again to-day, but
the pressure was not urgent, and any
evidence of support in the market tend
ed to check the selling. Such support
developed for Erie and Reading during i
the course of the first hour and a prac- j
tically complete recovery from the open- j
ing declines was made. There was a
good demand for Illinois Central, which
was accounted for by unsubstantiated j
rumors of an intended increase in the j
dividend rate. At the recovered level
Of prices the demand became so languid
as to cause fresh discouragement over i
the failure to appear of the January \
reinvestment demand, and . prices!
sagged away again at the last, making J
the closing weak and dull.
Disappointment professed over j
the bank statement, but the showing [
was not calculated to produce more;
than a nominal influence with the ex
treme ease ruling in the money market, j
The fact is not doubted that currency
has started to move in a strong tide to '
this center, and the failure of the bank j
statement to reflect It Is attributed to
cross-currents in the movement, which
confuse the commutation by the aver
age system. The Metropolitan" stocks j
were weak from special causes, nota- j
bly the threatened competition for their
suburban traffic, and their sharp de
clines had a sympathetic effect on the
rest of the market. There were persist
ent rumors, such as have circulated for
some days, that the report of United
States Steel earnings for the final quar
ter of the year would prove less satis
factory than preliminary estimates had*
promised.
There was much discussion of the
conference of political leaders which
was announced to assemble at Wash
ington during the afternoon to con
sider the programme for Congressional j
action, including legislation concerning j
corporations and tariff revision.
SALE OF BONDS QUIET.
The weekly mercantile reviews of
i fered no grounds for selling stocks, and
the enormous figure of the December
' anthracite output was a fostering in-
I fluence upon the firmness of the coal
| ers. The favorable industrial news
j failed, however, to stimulate anyxde
| tnand for stocks, and the market for
i bonds was also quieter than during the
; early part of the week.
Total sales of bonds, par value, $1,
--! 800,000.
j The Stock Exchange contingent atart
â ed the new year on Tuesday with a
| number of important happenings to ac-
I count for, and spent rather a busy day
jon that day. But the subsequent deal
j ings showed a large abatement of spec
| ulative interest and a growing tone of
i hesitation and indifference. The fall of
(Port Arthur and the decision of the
! Northern Securities injunction suit in
favor of the company had long been
counted on. But they were responsible
for a spurt in the market nevertheless.
; The interpretation of these events was
1 evidently a favorable one from the
j point of view of the financial world.
' But the natural effect of realizing sales
j with f*he good news out was* to cause
! some reaction in the level of prices.
The London financial public has
! held a clearly defined conviction that
the fall of Port Arthur would serve
;to hasten the end of the costly strug
" gle in the Far East and bring to the
j world the benefits of; an early peace.
' This opinion has been somewhat modi
fled by the course of events during the
, week and the apprehension has grown
:up that the termination of the war is
still indefinitely in the future. The
disaster to the Russian arras has
raised some misgivings also as to the
success of the forthcoming Russian
; lean and there has been some liquida
| tion in the London market for Paris
! account, which is supposed to be due
Ito the large commitments of that cen
; ter of capital in Russian securities.
I This has caused a reflex depression
jto some extent in other great centers
, of capital.
PLANS OF RAILROADS.
In the case of the Northern Securl- !
ties decision also the natural move
ment of taking profits has had added
influence from the failure of some of .
the expected consequences developed, j
In the first place the determination to
appeal the case and the stay thus ef
fected in the proposed litigation of
the company comprises an indefinite
prolongation of the litigation. It had
been hoped that a plan of settlement 'â 
had been arranged that would be pro
mulgated promptly on the reaching of
a decision by the court.
The belief continues general in the '
financial world that great projects are
working out in the railroad world and
It Is commonly expected that the large
accumulation of money resurces in
New York this spring, which seems in- |
evltable, will be taken advantage of
to secure the additional capital re- I
quired for these projects. Rumors of j
their form are vague and various, but ;

GIVE COFFEE TO WORKERS
TO STOP BEER DRINKING
.Novel Means Used by Pretty Girls of
Gotham in Fight Against .
Intemperance.
NEW YORK, Jan. 7.âPretty girls
bearing pails of steaming coffee for
the men engaged In the 'excavating
work for a new railway terminal on
Forty-second street have disclosed a
new method of temperance work in
this city. Ever since the work began
the* students and faculty of the Bible
Teacher's Training School near by
have had their attention distracted
from their studies by the sight of the
laborers getting in line promptly at
the sHroke of 12 and starting for beer.
There are numerous saloons and two
breweries near by, so temptations were
plentiful.
A crusade against the liquor sellers
in the shape of speeches was discussed
and quickly put aside as useless and
the students set themelves to devise
some more efficient form of fortifying
the men against temptation to quaff
b<er. Some one suggested a substi
tute and coffee was chosen. Great
quantities, steaming hot, were carried
among the workmen as they quit for
lunch and a great falling off in the
patronage of the saloons and brewer
ies in the neighborhood had resulted.
The faculty and students express
much gratification over the success of
the- venture. * _

NEW YORK, Jan. 7.âThe agitation
against the manner in which the so
called Raines law hotels and liquor
saloons in the 'â¢tenderloin" district are
conducted resulted to-day in the sum
moning of forty-five hotel and saloon
keepers before a Police Court.
Magistrate Ommen, before whom
the keepers were arraigned, told them
that the "family entrance," with a
hole in the wall for the passage of
ituuor, was a violation of the law and
would have to be abandoned. He also
notified them that he would allow
them one week to remove all parti
tions, booths and sitting-rooms from
fhr barrooms.
District Attorney Jerome said he
thought the magistrate's interpretation
of the law would have the effect of
closing up the saloons to-morrow and
that the summoning of the saloon
keepers would help toward the
amendment of the present liquor law.

how to secure 320 acres of Government

Attorney M. Rossen was among the
persons awaiting the opening of the of

"Hunter called on me several days
ago and attempted to interest me to
the extent of purchasing $500 worth of
stock in the company. He said if I
would purchase mining stock he would
make me general agent In Chicago."
The scheme regarding the staking of
homesteads in Idaho has been operated
for a month, according to the police.

HINDU CRITIC
AFTER KIPLING
Declares That the English
Author Does Not Know the
India He Writes About
Special Dispatch to TbÂ« CaU.
LONDON, Jan. 7.âThere. has Just
arisen a critic bold enough to declare
that Rudyard Kipling doesn't know his
India. And what gives his opinion spe
cial weight is the fact that Rama Chan
dra Rao, who recently contributed a
lengthy article on the author of "Kirn"
to a London periodical, is a Hindu. He
has no difflcurty either in citing nu
merous instances to prove his conten
tion that "although Kipling has come
in contact with certain aspects of In
dian life, true India and the destinies
of its teeming millions are an unsolved
mystery to him." Discussing t,he char
acters in "Kirn" this Hindu critic says:
"Mahbub All is quite an artificial
conception, and Baboo Hurry Chunder
Mookerjee Is not a specimen of any of
the Bengalis I have the pleasure to
know. Mr. Kipling's remarks about
Indian life are not convincing," the
writer goes on. "For Instance, the old
man was speaking truth, which Is a
thing a native seldom presents to a
stranger. The stranger Is then to .be
pitied, for he does not know how to win
the confidence of the Indian people.

Mrs. Cralgie Is much distressed at the
outcome of a pathetic little case in
which she recently interested herself.
A young actress named Kathleen Mar
vin, who is known to "John Oliver
Hobbs," appeared in the Marylebone
Police Court about a month ago
charged with drunkenness. MraCraigle
visited the court several times and ul
timately had a private talk with the
magistrate, as the result of which the
girl was handed over to the care of her
husband, but warned that If she were
again charged with drunkenness she
would be sent away.
Mrs. Cralgie's protege did well for a
while, but a few days ago she appeared
in the dock at the Marylebone court
again on the original charge. She wept
bitterly while pleading for mercy, and
referring to her benefactress said, "I
know that I owe a great deal to that
dear lady." The magistrate ordered a
remand with a view to sending the girl
to an Inebriates' home.

"Now," says a writer in a Liberal
newspaper, "this illustrates the advan
tage which the tariff reform movement
possesses in having writers of imag
inative literature, not merely among its
statisticians, but among its platform
speakers. To what ordinary mind
would the complex and fascinating idea
of a bogey's ghost have suggested
itself? What Sir A. Conan Doyle
should do is to work up this conception.
A tariff reform ghost story might
easily be knocked together In a few
days, under the title (say) of "The Ad
venture of the Double-Distilled Spook,'
beginning with a chapter in which the
ghost of the buried bogey appears to the
surviving bogles and after frightening
them horribly announces that he did
not die a natural death, but was at
tacked from behind and buried alive by
a mysterious enemy, to whose identity
the departed bogey can furnish no clew
beyond the fact that he wears an eye
glass. The unraveling of the mystery
by a famous detective bogey might oc
cupy the rest of the story."

TRIBUTE TO RUSKTN.
Venice is about to pay a graceful trib
ute to the memory of John Ruskin.
Within a few days the city's municipal
court will place a marble slab on the
house which the famous writer occu
pied for so long, and which, American
travelers will remember, overlooks the
Canal of Guldecca. The following
Inscription is to be inscribed on the
stone:
"John Ruskin lived here from 1877 to
1882. High priest of art in the walls, of
our St. Mark as in all the monuments
in Italy, he sought the heart of the art
ist and the heart of the Italian people.
Every marble statue, every bronze fig
ure, every painted canvas, each thing,
indeed, told him that beauty is a relig
ion If the genius of a man creates it
and the people respectfully recognize it.
This stone is erected by the commune
of Venice in gratitude."
English authors are perturbed, and
with reason, over the result of the ap
plication made in court recently by T.
W. H. Crosland, who wrote "The Un
speakable Scot," for royalties due him
from Grant Richards, the London pub
lisher' whose affairs are now in the
hands of a receiver. Crosland declared
that though the printers, the binders
and the packers of his books were being
paid, the writer of them was unable to
get a penny, and this he stigmatized as
a rank Injustice. The learned Judge to
whom the application was made told
Crosland, however, that an author in
this situation Is an unsecured creditor
and that nothing could be done for him.

LATE FOES IN HISTORIC
INTERVIEW TALK OF
THEIR BATTLES.
! Nogi and Stcessef Meet as Friends
PORT ARTHUR, Thursday, Jan. o.-
The meeting of General Nogi and Gen
eral Stoessel to-day was as undramatfc
as the conclusion of the siege. It had
previously been arranged to take place
at noon in the single undamaged house
of the village of Shuishi. This house
was a miserable hovel called Plum
Tree Cottage. Through a misunder
standing General Stoessel rode out
from Port Arthur at 10 o'clock, accom
panied by Colonel Reiss and two stall
officers, to the Japanese lines and
missed the Japanese officer delegated
to escort him to the meeting place. The
general rode thither without an escort
and waÂ» received by a Junior officer,
who happened to be on the spot. The
latter telephoned to General Nogi, who
hurried his departure from head
quarters and arrived at 11 o'clock, ac
companied by Major Oeneral Ijichl, his
Chief of staff; Colonels Yasuhara, Mat
sudaira and Watanabe, staff officers,
and Kawskarin, secretary of the For
eign Office at Tokio.
General Stoessel is a large man of
heavy appearance and looks like a
good fighter.
GENERALS Â«CLASP HANDS.
When Nogi, looking careworn, en
tered the compound of the cottage, the
two generals cordially shook hands,
and Nogi, through an Interpreter, ex
pressed his pleasure at meeting a gen
eral who had fought so bravely and
gallantly for his Emperor and country.
General Stoessel thanked General
Nagi for the pleasure or meeting there
the hero of the victorious army.
General Nogi explained that he had
received a message from his Emperor,
asking that the greatest consideration
be shown to General Stoessel and his
officers, in appreciation of their splen
did loyalty to their Emperor and coun
try. Because of that wish, he added,
the Russian officers would be allowed
to wear their swords.
General Stoessel expressed his grati
tude to the Japanese Emperor for thus
saving the honor of his (Stoessel's)
family, and said his descendants would
appreciate the thoughtful kindness of
the Emperor of Japan. The general
also expressed the gratitude of his of
ficers and thanked Nogi for sending the
message from Stoessel to Emperor
Nicholas and transmitting his Majes
ty's reply, which read:
"I allow each officer to profit by the
reserved privilege to return to Russia
under the obligation not to take fur
ther part in the present war or to share
the destinies of their men."
Both generals then mutually praised
each other and their officers for brav
ery.
TALK OF THE BATTLES.
The conversation afterward turned
on the explosion of the mine at Sung
shu Mountain fort. General Stoessel
said the entire garrison of the fort was
killed or made prisoners.
The Russian commander greatly
praised the Japanese artillery practice,
especially the concentrated fire instan
taneous with the explosion of the Sung
shu mine. The gallant deeds of the
Japanese Infantry, General Stoessel
added, spoke for themselves. It was
Impossible to exaggerate their good
qualities. The skillful work of the en
gineers also has won his admiration.
Continuing, General Stoessel said he
had heard that General Nogi had lost
both of his sons. He praised Nogl's loy
alty In thus sacrificing his sons, who
had died lighting for their Emperor and
country. General Nogi smiled and re
plied:
"One of my sons gave his life at Nan-
Bhan and the other at 203-Meter Hill.
Both of these positions were of the
greatest importance to the Japanese
army. I am glad that the sacrifice of
my sons' lives had been In the capture
of such Important positions, as I feel
the sacrifices were not made In vain.
What Sulphur Does
For the Human Body in Health and
Disease.
The mention of sulphur will recall to
many of us the early days when our
mothers and grandmothers gave us our
daily dose of sulphur and molasses
every spring and fall. .
It was the universal spring and fall
"blood purifier," tonic and cure-all, and
mind you, this old-fashioned remedy
Was not without merit.
The idea was good, but the remedy
was crude and unpalatable, and a large
quantity had to be taken to get any
effect.
Nowadays we get all the beneficial
effects of sulphur in a palatable, con
centrated form, so that a single grain
is far more effective than a tablespoon
ful of the crude sulphur.
In recent years, research and experi
ment have proven that the best sulphur
for medicinal use is that obtained from
Calcium (Calcium Sulphide) and sold in
drug stores under the name of Stuart's
Calcium Wafers. They are small cho
colate coated pellets and contain the
active medicinal principle of sulphur in
a highly concentrated, effective form.
Few people are aware of the value of
this form of sulphur in restoring and
maintaining bodily vigor and health;
sulphur acts directly on the liver, and
excretory organs and purifies and en
riches the blood by the prompt elimina
tion of waste material.
Our grandmothers knew this â¢when
they dosed us with sulphur and mo
lasses every spring and fall, but the
crudity and impurity of ordinary flow
ers of sulphur were often worse than
the disease, and cannot compare with
the modern concentrated preparations
of sulphur, of which Stuart's Calcium
Wafers is undoubtedly the best and
most widely used.
They are the natural antidote for Uv
er and kidney troubles and cure consti
pation and purify the blood in a way
that often surprises patient and physi
cian alike..
Dr. R M. Wilkins while experiment
ing with sulphur remedies soon found
that the sulphur from Calcium was su
perior to any other form. He says:
"For liver, kidney and blood troubles,
especially when resulting from consti
pation or malaria, I have been sur
prised at the results obtained from
Stuart's Calcium Wafera In patients
suffering from bolls and pimples and
even deep-seated carbuncles, I have re
peatedly seen them dry up and disap
pear in four or Aye days, leaving the
skin clear and smooth. Although Stu
art's Calcium Wafers is a proprietary
article, and sold by druggists, and for
that reason tabooed by many physi
cians, yet I know of nothing so safe
and reliable for constipation, liver and
kidney troubles and especially in all
forms of skin disease as this remedy."
At any rate people who are tired of
pills, cathartics and so-called blood
"purifiers," will find in Stuart's Cal
cium Wafers, a far safer, more pala
table and effective preparation.
Their lives were nothing compared to
the objects sought."
General Stoessel then asked permis
sion to present his charger to General
Nogi as a token of his appreciation and
admiration. General Nogi expressed his
thanks for the Russian general's kind
ness, but said he could not accept the
horse; but, he continued, he would ac
cept it for the army, since he consid
ered that the Russian horses were the
property of Japan and felt he could not
make General Stoessel's charger his
private property.
General Nogi also promised that
when the horse was handed over to
him he would see that it was treated
with the greatest kindness, out of re
spect for the brave Russian general.
Thereupon General Stoessel assured
General Nogi that he admired his rig
orous principles and appreciated his
point of view.
STOESSEL TO BE NOGI'S GUEST.
The Japanese commander requested
General Stoessel to continue to occupy
his residence at Port Arthur until ar
rangements were completed for the re
turn of himself and family to Russia-
Referring to the burial of the dead,
General Nogi said the Japanese, since
the beginning of the military opera
tions, had always buried the' Russian
dead. Those found later o.n would be
interred at a special spot and a suit
able memorial would be erected as a
tribute to the bravery of Japan's for
mer foes.
After luncheon, at which both gen
erals sat together, a group photograph
was taken at the cottage and General
Stoessel remounted his charger, to
show the horse's good points, said
"good-by" to General Nogi and rode
back to Port Arthur.
The regular Russian soldiers In Port
Arthur marched out to-day. The only
troops now In the city are the volun
teers.
Two fires were started In Port Arthur
to-day, for which General Stoessel
apologized. He said the volunteers
were unable to control the populace
and he desired that the Japanese en
ter Port Arthur Immediately, to keep
order.
The formal entry of the Japanese
army into Port Arthur has been fixed
for Sunday, January 8.
BRITISH MOTIVE IMPUGNED.
Not Believed to Be Especially Desir-
OM That War Should End.
PARIS, Jan. 7.âAfter, conferring
with Foreign Minister Delcasse a lead
ing diplomat said to-day that media
tion in the Japanese-Russian war
would be as unacceptable to Russia j
now as It would have been to the j
North after the defeat at Bull Run. j
The belief is growing that Great Bri- i
tain's anxiety for mediation is not en
tirely disinterested. A British official
recently said:
"If Europe or America does not in
tervene, Japan and Russia will make
their terms of peace without consult- :
ing Burope or America."
This leads diplomats to say that
Great Britain is less desirous of peace
than to secure a voice in the terms of
peace.
BERLIN, Jan. 7. â The Sud
Deutsche Reichse Korrespondenz,
which maintains close personal rela
tions with Chancellor yon Bulow, dis
cusses the fall of Port Arthur as fa
cilitating the progress toward peace.
It thinks that the chivalry shown by
General Nogi in the terms allowed
General Stoessel will probably make '
an impression at St. Petersburg which
later will hasten an agreement be
tween the belligerents without inter
mediation of a third party. It adds
that, while hostilities undoubtedly
will cotlnue in Manchuria, the almost
conciliatory termination of the heroic
drama at Port Arthur will make It
easier to resume diplomatic negotia
tions at a suitable juncture.
PRINCE NOT A PRISONER.
Ouktomsky Escapes From Port Ar
thur to Chefu in Disguise.
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 7.âA
special dispatch from Chefu' says it is
reported that Rear Admiral Prince
Ouktomsky and Rear Admiral Doch
insky have arrived there, disguised, on
board a launch.
Prince Ouktomsky assumed com
mand of the Port Arthur squadron af
ter Admiral Makaroff was drowned
as a result of the sinking of his flag
ship, the battleship Petropavlovsk, at
the entrance of Port Arthur on April
13. Later the Prince was replaced in
command of the squadron by the late
Refer Admiral Withoeft After the
latter was killed during the naval bat
tle of August 10 Prince Ouktomsky
again assumed command of the
squadron and, it is said, contrary to
orders, returned to Port Arthur, for
which it was alleged he was to be
tried by court-martial. This was de
nied, but the Prince was succeeded in
command of the naval* forces by
Rear Admiral Wlren. Recently, It is
understood, Prince Ouktomsky has
not been attached to any of the Rus
sian ships.
The name of Rear Admiral Dochin
sky has not figured in the cable dis
patches from the Far East.

Russian Christmas Finds the Czar's
People in Gloom.
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 7.âWith a
heavy heart Russia to-day celebrated
I Christmas. The day was particularly
j a family fete. The trials of the war
and losses at the front â¢ had brought
sorrow and mourning to countless
homes and the usual rejoicing was ab
sent- In St. Petersburg all the depart
ments of the Government were closed
until Tuesday and Intense cold kept
the people indoors. All the ordinary
public festivities and private entertain
ments were omitted. The imperial
family observed the day quietly at the
palace of Tsarskoe-Selo. There was a
large Christmas tree for the children,
but there was no elaborate celebration,
such as generally marks the day there.

POET STAGES
â¢ QIAINT PLAY
Charles Keeler Produced His
"Triumph of Light" in the
Little Unitarian Church
CROWD SEES SPECTACLE
Beautiful Verse tind Pretty
Pictures Combine to Give
Rare Treat to Audience
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, Jan. 7.
A mystery play by a Berkeley poet,
with some of the moot prominent peo
ple of the university town In the cast,
proved a magnet to-night to crowd
to overflowing the quaint Unitarian
Church on Bancroft way.
Charles Keeler, maker of beautiful
verse, staged the play, which was of
his own writing, modeled in form after
the old English morality plays. Keeler
called it "The Triumph of Light" It
glorified love and light as opposed to
what the poet thinks is the modern
tendency to worship gold.
On the diminutive stage of the
church mingled odd shapes of medieval
makeup, as the play proceeded, and
strangely clad characters, picturesque
in the extreme, made of the stage a
gorgeous blaze of color, while the act
ors recited and sang the exquisite lines
given them by the poet.
Keeler appeared as the Priest of the
Sun in the prologue. He was clad in
a scarlet robe, piped with gold. He
told how Mortality, a "man unhappy,
world-surfeited and wandering alone
in ebon gloom," was to be shown the
mystery of life. Following this pro
logue came darkness, the faint mur
mur of an organ, and voices of an un
seen chorus, mingling with the laments
of Mortality. Then appeared the
Seuaph of Dawn, heralding the coming
of the King of Day. The black-robed
figures fled. To the strains of the
"War March of the Priests," in "Ath
alie," by Mendelssohn, came the spirits
of California, led by Pan.
After a succession of picturesque
scenes, where all the characters con
tributed to the beauty and impressive
nesg of the spectacle, came the final
picture, where Mortality, after a se
ries of wanderings and minor revela
tions, receives the torch of Truth and
awakens the sleeping child, Love, who
with a kiss gives him immortality.
Thus the triumph of Light is complete.
Some of the principal characters In
the play were taken by the following
persons: Charles Keeler, Priest of the
Sun; Professor Frank Soule, Mortality;
Miss Ethel Preble,' Seraph of Dawn;
Mrs. H. N. Minor, Nature, Mother of
Earth and Sea; Lester Parker, King
of Light. The chorus of "California"
was composed of Mr. and Mrs. Payson,
Judge Haight, Professor and Mrs. Far
rington, Mr. Trott. Bertha and A.
Brehm, Mrs. W. B. Clarke, Mrs. Loth
rop and Mrs. Cadey.

TALENTED ACTRESS WHO WIU.

MAJESTIC.
"Mlzpah; or. the Story of Esther," ;
a poetical drama, based upon the story
of the Scriptures, by Ella Wheeler Wil- I
cox and Lusconibe Searelle. will be
given its premier at the Majestic Thea
ter this evening. Mrs. Wilcox and Lus
combc Searelle have been engaged upon
the drama for the past two years, and
it is all written in blank verse. The
scenes and situations as have been de
veloped at the rehearsals show unusual
strength, particularly the part of the
Vashti, to be presented by ;
Eleanor Gordon, who has given such i
undisputable evidence of her emotional
powers in previous productions at Mr. I
Bishop's handsome playhouse. The 1
music incidental to the play is on the f
oriental order, and is by Luscombe ;
Starelle, who has international fame as
a dramatist and composer. He is, by j
in* way, not a stranger to this city, j
having been a tactor in musical circles j
here a quarter of a century ago.

CATARRH OF THE STOMACH.
A Pleasant, Simple, but Safe and Ef
fectual Cure for It.
Catarrh of the stomach has long
been considered the next thing to in-,
curable. The usual symptoms are a
full or bloating sensation after eating,
accompanied sometimes with sour or!
watery risings, a formation of gases,
causing pressure on the heart and
lungs and difficult breathing, head
aches, fickle appetite, nervousness and
a general played out, languid feeling. 1
There is often a foul taste in the
mouth, coated tongue and if the in
terior of the stomach could be seen it
would show a slimy, inflamed condition.
The cure for this common and ob
stinate trouble is found in a treatment
which causes the food to be readily,
thoroughly digested before it has time
to ferment and irritate the delicate
mucous surfaces of the stomach. To
fecure a prompt and healthy digestion
la the one necessary thing to do and I
when normal digestion is secured the 1
catarrhal condition will have disap- j
t>eared.
According to Dr. Harlanson the safest
and best treatment is to use after each
meal a tablet, composed of Diastase,
Aseptic. Pepsin, a little Nux, Golden!
Seal and fruit acids. These tablets can
now be found at all drug stores under
the name of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tab- â 
lets and not being a patent medicine j
(an be used with perfect safety and 1
assurance that healthy appetite and;
thorough digestion will follow their|
regular use after meals.
Mr. R. S. V.'orkman, Chicago, Ills.,
writes: "Catarrh is a local condition
resulting from a neglected cold in the!
head, whereby the lining membrane of j
the nose becomes inflamed and the:
poisonous discharge therefrom passing
haekward into the throat reaches the
stomach, this producing catarrh of the
stomach. Medical authorities pre
scribed for me for three years for
catarrh of stomach without cure, but
to-day I am the happiest of men after
using only one box of Stuart's Dys
, pepsla Tablets. I can not find appro
priate words to express my good feel
ing. I have found flesh, appetite and
sound rest from their use."
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets Is the
safest preparation as well as the l
simplest and most convenient remedy J
for any form of Indigestion, catarrh
of stomach, biliousness, sour stomach,
heartburn and bloating after meals. 1

BANKER MORSE
REMAINS AWAY
Not a Passenger on the
Liner Lucania on Her
Arrival at New York
NEW YORK, Jan. 7.âCharles W.
Morse, the banker, did not arrive from
Europe on the steamship Ducania to
day. He had engaged a stateroom on
the vessel and it was expected he had
gone aboard at Queenstown, but he
failed to appear.
Assistant District Attorney Garvan :
to-day said he placed no credence in ,
the report that Mrs. William Gelch- '
enen was in New York and that she ,
would appear before the Grand Jury J
on Monday. Garvan said: ,
"I accept the word of her lawyer and i
her son that she sailed last Tuesday.
We are satisfied that Mrs. Gelchenen
was not a passenger on the .Deutsch
land to-day. Miss Gelchenen, her
daughter, Miss Edith English and Miss
Dunne, aunt of Miss Gelchenen, were
passengers on the Hamburg liner. That
telegrams, letters and baskets of flow
ers were sent to the Deutschland for
Miss Gelchenen is easily explained by
the fact that many of her friends, hear
ing that she was to sail to-day, sent
these tokens of friendship."
Garvan denied a report that subpenas
have been issued for Attorneys James
M. Back and Samuel Untermeyer for
their appearance before the Grand
Jury and later District Attorney Je
rome said that no subpena had been
issued for Charles W. Morse. -
INDICTED FOR MURDER
COMMITTED SIX YEARS AGO
Dcs Moines Man to Stand Trial for
the Deatli of Mabel
Schofield. i
DES MOINES. Jan. 7.âThe most ]
remarkable crime mystery in the his- ;
tory of lowa is again to appear in the j
courts. For almost six years there ,
has been unceasing efforts to find the
murderer of Mabel Schofield, who was
19 years old when she was slain. There
has hardly been a Grand Jury session
in Polk County in five years in which
this case has not been presented, and ,
yet there has never been an indict- |
ment until now.
Charles Thomas, who from the first
has been suspected, Is now charged I
with the murder. **
Mabel Schofield, who was the
dauehter of a physician living at j
Macksburg, lowa, was visiting at the j
home of H. W. Thomas in this city. J
One morning she disappeared and two i
days later her body was taken from i
the Dcs Moines River.
COUNCIL BLUFFS, lowa. Jan. 7.âTne Bar

mited last night and the building badly
wrecked. It Is not known how much was
secured by th* burglars. 1
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 8, 1905. r
MRS. AUGUSTA BISHOP
NOT ASSASSIN'S VICTIM
California Woman Learns With Sur
prise of the Anxiety of Her
Friends.
DENVER, Jan. 7.âMrs. Augusta I.
Bishop was not the victim of the
mysterious murder on Mount Cutler,
near Colorado Springs. She arrived
in Denver last night and was seen to
day. She was surprised when she
learned that her friends feared she
had been killed and said regarding
her movements:
"I was in Colorado Springs most of
the time while away. Why I did not
write to my Denver friends I hardly
know. I was going to write to Mrs.
Jones, but kept delaying it. I have
some things stored at her house. The
letter which she wrote to me at Col
orado Springs was forwarded to me
here and I received it this afternoon.
I was in Cheyenne Canyon last sum
mer, but have not been there since,
so it must have been some other Mrs.
Bishop who had photographs taken
there last November. I did not have
any pictures taken there."
Mrs. Bishop answers the description
of the dead woman closely.

"THERE'S A REASON."
INDICTMENTS
ARE DISMISSED
Mayor and Chief of Police
of Portland Are Fully
Exonerated of Any Offense
PORTLAND, Jan. ".âUpon motion of
District Attorney John Manning the
indictments which were returned by
the county Grand Jury against Mayor
George H. Williams and Chief of Police
Charles H. Hunt of this city were to
day dismissed by State Cireult Judge
A. L. Fraser. Manning also asked that
the record show that Mayor William 3
be ful'y exonerated of any offense
charged In the indictment.
The Grand Jury had hardly finished
making its final report and had been
dismissed when Manning said:
"I have an Indictment against our
Mayor, the Hon. George H. Williams,
charging him with having violated the
malfeasance statute in this, that he
neglected to instruct the Chief of Police
of this city to close a certain gambling
house on a certain day. I fully realize
that no man is above the law, and if
Mayor Williams was, upon evidence
sufficient in a court of law to justify
a trial, presumably guilty of any Jl
legal act, I would be the first to prose
cute him. But after having careful
ly investigated the evidence upon which
this indictment was predicated I find
nothing against Mayor Williams that
would "warrant me as District Attorney
in putting the county to the expense
ot trying thia,case. lam satisfied that
any Jury would and ought to acquit
the Mayor; and furthermore I believe
that a majority of the Grand Jury who
had Mayor Williams indicted did it
without giving proper attention to the
evidence which was submitted to them.
Under the circumstances I recommend
that the indictment against the Hon.
George H. Williams, Mayor of our city,
be .dismissed and that he be fully ex
onerated of any offense charged in the
indictment."

ROCHESTER. N. V., Jan. 2. â (Special;
Correspondence.)â Discarding the use
loss drugs and medicines dispensed by
doctors and yet healing hopeless invalids
of diseases pronounced incurable by phy
sicians and specialists, succeeding in re
storing life and health when.doctor after
doctor tailed, Professor Thomas F. Ad
kin of this city has proven the value of
a wonderful discovery that threatens to
upset modern medical practice. In the
face of opposition, criticism, even ridi
cule, he has persisted in his belief that
hope should not be lost until actual and
unmistakable dissolution of the body oc
curs. He claims, and offers evidence be
yond doubt, that he has made the human
heart beat again in the body of a woman
given up to death. He cites names and
instances, where, by means of his discov
ery, he has made the blind see and the
lame walk: where he has permanently
I *ured paralysis, consumption, syphilis,
rheumatism. Blight's disease and other
' diseases heretofore supposed to be in
surable. More than that, he states that
he can cure the sick in their own homes
hundreds of miles away without stirring
from his office. In one instance, that of 1
a Mrs. L. A. Phillips of Texas, tne wit-.
â  lessee say that he raised her from the
'l"ad. Whether that is literally true or
not, there is little doubt but that the wo
man would be in her grave to-day were I

human life and his marvelous control !
over disease and death. Mrs. Phillips
had been a hopeless invalid for many !
years, and for the last live had been bed- !
fast, could lie on one side only and was
covered with bedsores. She was suffer- !
ing from a severe complication of dis
' t ases. including stomach, kidney and fe- I
male troubles, and had been under treat- |
ment of twelve different hospitals and
various doctors, all of whom failed to
help her and pronounced her case incura
ble. Her agonies were so great that they
threw her into convulsive spasms, while
her body was wasted to skin and bones.
All the medicines given her were with- 1
out effect, and she was rapidly nearing I
her grave when she heard of Prof. Ad
kin. Broken in body, pain-weary and |
without faith, but hoping against hope In
. this last desperate clfance. she wrote to
him. He replied at once, saying that he
would take her case, assuring her that
he could and would save her life and re
store her to health. And notwithstand
ing what the doctors had said, he did
cure her completely, so that to-day she Is I

thankful and enthusiastic. Another case j
. almost equally remarkable was that of j
Mr. R. A. Wallen of Finey. Mo., who for
four years was paralyzed and was stead- !
ily growing more helpless- in spite of all i
the doctors who attended him. His cure !
was so quick and marvelous that. In a :
letter, he says: "It was like bringing

H. L. Kelley of Seal Cove, Me., and hun
dreds of other suffering men and women
have likewise been rescued by this won- ;
oerful man. who seems to control some
mysterious force not known to ordinary j
mortals.
When called upon for an interview, '
Prof. Adkin said:
"Yes. I remember the cases you men-!
Hon, but do not quite understand why l
they should cause any especial astonish- !
ment, since they are 110 more wonderful !
than scores of other cures I have made
since I announced my discovery to the i
world. I firmly believe that there is no
dteease /I may not cure, and whatever
other men may do or fail to do, I meanj
to keep on healing the sick and afflicted
â¢ of any disease they may have just as.
long as I am able. T make no exceptions,
rich or poor. East or West, wherever
they live, it is all the same to me. Ml
who are sick from any cause may be
cured in their own homes simply by
writing and telling me the name of their
trouble or their principal symptoms* age
and sex. and I will give them of my ser
vices absolutely without charge. I feel
that It is my duty to God and man to
give freely, to help all who are afflicted
and not to use my discovery merely to
make money." t
"Do you really mean that any one who
is sick can write to you to be cured,
without paying you any money?"
"Exactly. I mean just that. I know
*it may seem an unusual thing to do, but
if I choose to help the earth's physical
unfortunates without pay. there's noth
ing to prevent my doing so, is there? I
have my own reason for my course in
this matter and I do not want any one
to feel that by taking advantage of my
offer they are accepting charity. I will
have my reward in provfeig to the world
the great value of my discovery, and the
uselessness of wasting moneson doctors
and medicines when it is notnecessary."
"What is this discovery?"
'T can show you better than I can ex
plain. Have some one who is sick write
to me and watch the results. If you do 1
so I would prefer that you select a
"hronlc case, some one whom physicians
have said cannot be cured. Any doctor
may cure a simple case with a few doses
of medicines, but Â« want those where
both doctors and medicines have failed.
Tell any one who wants to be cured to
write to me, addressing Professor,
Thomas F. Adkin, Office 546 D, Roches
â¢ ter. N. Y."
"But how can you cure those at a dis
tance; those whom you never see?"
"Just as easily and Just as surely as
though I went to them or they came to
me. Distance makes no difference.
Whether they live one or a thousand
miles away is all the same. A letter is
all that Is necessary to enlist my aid.
What other men may or may not be able
to do. how they fail or what they charge
makes no difference to me. My power Is
supreme."
Investigation proves that Professor
Adkin's claims are more than borne out
by the facts, and that hm fulfills his
promise of free service tdVne very letter.

No Large Transactions Mark the Week

able predictions regarding the volume

money. These indicate strong confi

BANK STATEMENT TELLS
OF INCREASE IN DEPOSITS
Report Shows That for Second Time
in Fifteen Years Surplus Re
serve Is Reduced.
NEW YORK. Jan. 7.âThe Financier
says: The most notable feature of the
official statement of the New York As
sociated Banks last week was its fail
ure to reflect In the cash item the large
gain which was estimated from the
traceable movements of money during
the week, an increase fn legal tenders
partly offsetting a loss in specie, while
the estimates indicated a gain of more
than $7,500,000 cash.
It is difficult to account for this dis
crepancy upon the theory that it was
caused by the week's exports of gold,
for these shipments were included in
the estimates and, moreover, the trace
able gain was chiefly from the interior
flow of currency. The net decrease in
cash shown by the statement was $795,
--300âspecie decreasing $4,870,800, while
legal tenders increased $4,075,500. Depos
its were augmented $5,119,500, which was
$2,873,300 in excess of the sum of the
increase in loans less the loss of cash,
therefore the statement showed an un
usually bad proof.
The required reserve was increased
$1,279,875 through the augmented de
posits, which requirement, added to the
net loss of cash, made a decrease of
$2,075,175 in the surplus reserve to $11,
--608,250, or about $3,000,000 less than the
surplus at the corresponding date of
1904. Computed upon the basis of de
posits, less those of $22,791,200 public
funds, the surplus last week was $17,
--306,000. Loans were increased $3,041,500,
reflecting probably ordinary loaning op
erations.
One interesting feature of the state
ment is that with the exception of 1903
this is the first time in fifteen years
when there has been a decrease In the
surplus reserve. Even in that year the
reduction in this item was less than
$500,000.

THREATENS LIFE
OF A PREMIER
Pennsylvania Laborer Makes
Attempt to Blackmail
Count Tisza of Hungary
WASHINGTON, Jan. 7.âChief Wllkle
of the secret service to-day received a
telegram from Lebanon, Pa., stating
that Ignaz Wenzler, a laborer in one
of the iron mills there, had been ar
rested and held under $3000 bonds for
having attempted to blackmail and
threaten the life of Count yon Tisza,
the Premier of Hungary.
Some weeks ago. It is said, Wenzler
wrote to the Count, signing a fictitious
name to the letter, stating that Wenz
ler, a distant relative of his, was in
great need and demanding a remittance
of $2000, in default of whioh a repre
sentative of the "black hand" would
go to Budapest and kill the Count be
fore Christmas day. The letter came,
to Chief Wllkle through the State De
partment and secret service detectives
were at once put on the case. Wenzler
was located and a sample of his hand
writing obtained by a German, who ob
tained his assistance in writing to a
friend in Hungary. Later a letter car
rier obtained a written statement from
Wenzler to the effect that he expected
a remittance of $2000 from Count Tisza.
The handwritings being identical,
Wenzler was arrested and in default of
bail was sent to Jail at Harrisburg,
charged with having used the mails to
defraud.
BIGAMOUS MARRIAGE DUE
TO IGNORANCE OF LAW
Woman Regards Desertion by First
Husband as Ground for Taking
, a Second.
NEW YORK. Jan. 7.âAn alleged
bigamous marriage whijch. it is said,
was unwittingly performed by the
Mayor in the City Hall a few days
ago, has ended in the arrest of Mrs.
Margaret Loose. The prisoner is said
to have admitted that her first mar
riage was with a Seventh Day Ad
ventist clergyman of that name now
living in Irvington, N. J.
.In the ceremony at the City Hall
she was wedded to Maurice Gardner.
The Rev. Mr. Loose read In the news
papers an account of the latter mar
riage and, hastening to this city, de
manded before a police magistrate a
warrant for the young woman's ar
rest. Although he had not lived with
her for five years, he said, It would
be wicked to permit her to live as the
wife of another man when she already
had a husband living.
The prisoner, after having been tak
en from a cozy new home in the
Bronx, said the minister had declined
to support her properly; so, directly
after her baby was born Aye years
ago, she took the child ana moved to
the home of her mother and after
passing nearly five years there said
she supposed her marriage to Gard
ner was perfectly legal.

MAKING PAPER
OF IRISH PEAT
American's Scheme to Uti
lize Beg of Green Isle for
â¢ Novel Purpose a Success
Special DiSDd'.ch to The Call.
DUBLIN, Jan. 7. âEverything seems
to indicate that the project undertaken
â¢ by an American to manufacture paper
.out ot* Irish bog peat is going to be a
great suctfÃKfc~Â« The American in ques
tion, William M. Callender of New
York, has, of course, been intimately
identified with the paper trade in the
r United States for many years. The
' process discovered by him of making
. bog mold or "peat" into paper was i
the result of lengthy study and ex- 1
periment and it is being put to the
test near the famous bogs of Allan, in
the heart of Ireland.
Armed with $45,000 capital, Cal
lender descended upon the hitherto
obscure little village of Celbridge, in
the County of Kildare, and there se
cured*premises on which to erect the
' factory where he proposes to trans
form peat into paper. The Allan bogs
close by, from which the American
gets his raw material, have never been
of any other use or interest to Ire
land except as a geographical land
mark, so that Callender had no dif
ficulty in negotiating the purchase of
800 acres of the unsightly swamp with
. the local landlord, the Earl of Meath.
"The actual price is not mentioned, but
it can be safely assumed that it was
. not excessive.
The Celbridge Paper Mills are yet
far from complete, but already they
â  t are able to give employment to close
upon a hundred hands and in another
njonth or two when in full swing it is
estimated that 300 men and women
will find employment there. At pres
ent' "the Callender Paper Manufactur
ing Company, Limited"âas the firm
is named âconfines its operations to
the production of paper bags and loose
paper for parceling purposes, the
manufacture of postcards and enve
lopes and other adjuncts to the paper
trade, but when the mill Is complete
and the new machinery In full work
ing order more ambitious efforts will
ba made.
An experiment to produce boards
from the same material Is now being
tried and if this proves successful Cal
lender says he will start mills wher- j
ever he can find a convenient expanse
of bog in Ireland. The present output
of the mill is not enough to supply
Ireland, so great Is the demand in
the country for Irish manufactured
goods, but when it is set working to
ltÂ« full capacity Callender hopes to
open up markets in the United States.
, Callender's enterprise has been the
means of changing the whole aspect of
Jhe sleepy little Kildare village, where
the sound of machinery has not been
heard for thirty years.

Diplomacy Averts Clash
Between Great Britain

â¦
TROUBLE KEPT SECRET!
Dispute Due to a Threat
Contained in the British
Army and Navy Gazette
BERLIN, Jan. 7.âThe National Lib
eral leader, Dr. Paasche, addressing his
constituents at Creusenach to-day,
made the astonishing statement that
Germany' and Great Britain were on
the verge of war last week, referring
eventually to the representations which
the German Foreign Office made to
Great Britain regarding a bellicose
threat against Germany in the Army
and Navy Gazette. Dr. PaascHe's
words were:
"I know with absolute certainty that
Germany and Great Britain last week
were much nearer warlike complica
tions than many people dream. Our
diplomacy succeeded in averting the
danger, though with difficulty."
Referring to the American duty on
German wines, Dr. Paasche said he
had mentioned the matter to Chancellor
yon Bulow, who had promised to do
everything in his power to prevent it.
Nevertheless, he added, the Americans
were incensed against Germany because
of difficulties thrown in the way of the
importation of American goods to Ger
many.

Executive Orders Release From BUl
blU Prison of Native Who Gave
Aid to Government.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 7. âThe Presi
dent has pardo&ed Juan Gutierrez,
now serving a life sentence in Bilibili
Prison, Manila. Gutierrez is a native
Filipino and was convicted by a mili
tary commission of having killed
prisoners and sentenced to be hanged,
bur on account of the aid rendered by
him to the United States in securing
the surrender of other insurgents, the
sentence was subsequently commuted
to imprisonment at hard labor for life.
The present action of the President
Is baaed upon the information that the
testimonj' upon which Gutierrez was
convicted was unreliable, being, it is
alleged, part of a conspiracy to {ret
him out of the way and also because
of the subsequent important service
rendered the Government of the
United States by Gutierrez in the sup
pression of the Philippine insurrection.
PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 7âThe total an
thracite production for thÂ» year 1904 was al
most two million tons below the outDut of
1903. The total production for 1904 was 67,
--492,522, as compared with 59,3(i2,83l during
the previous year.
HE HAD FAITH
And It Was Justified.
"In reply to your letter of recent date
will say that I am cured as sound as a
dollar. I used about three of the fifty
cent packages. I was going to write
you, but was holding up to see if the
piles would give me any further
trouble. I feel no signs of the piles
and believe I am cured entirely. I had
faith in Pyramid Pile Cure at the start
and stuck right to the treatment. You
can refer any one to me you like. I
can soon tell what Pyramid Pile Cure
has, done for me. Wishing you much
success I remain, J. C. Kinkaid, Mgr
l'or Fleischman & Co., agency at Knox
ville, Term."
It is a well recognized fact that the
best advertising an article can have is
that which is known as "word of
mouth"; this rightfully carries more
weight than all the claims which can
be set forth. It follows that Mr. Kin
kaid, with his wide acquaintance, will
largely promote the sale and" use of
Pyramid Pile Cure becauseâand here
|Â« the vital pointâhe knows whereof
he speaks and not only advocates its
use but does so with enthusiasm; this
is not to be wondered at, and in point
cf fact can any one, after reading his
letter, doubt that this remedy cures?
Pyramid Pile Cure is sold by drug
gists for the low price of fifty cents a
package: it is in suppository form, Is
applied directly to the parts affected
and does its work quickly and pain
lessly; there is no other remedy "Just
as good."
A little book describing the causes
and cure of piles is published by Pyra
mid Drug Co., Marshal], Mich., and
will be sent free to any address for the
asking.

CHEUNG HIRES
MANY LAWYERS
But Their Headway Is Small
Thus Far in Motion to
Quash Murder Indictment
GRAND JURORS TESTIFY
Andrews and Bowes of the
Committee Did Not Vote
on the Final Accusation
Chan Cheung, the big man of China
town, whom the Grand Jury indicted
for complicity in the murder of Tom
Yick on May 8, 1903, is not lacking in
counsel of wise men of the law. When
the motion to quash the indictment
came up for argument before Judge
Lawlor yesterday ex-Governor Budd,
Frank V. Bell, Henry C. Dibble and
Oliver Dibble were on hand to represent
the prisoner.
The grand jurors were in attendance
as witnesses under subpena by the de
fendant, whose plea is that the charge
of murder was not made against him
in good faith, but because he would
not tell, as the inquisitors believed he
could, of the police corruption in China
town. Budd promised to show that the
police committee of the Grand Jury
held Chan Cheung in close confinement
for forty-eight hours in the hope of ex
tracting information from him concern
ing the protection fund raised among
the Chinese gambling-houses, and con
stantly held over him the threat that if
he did not divulge the story of grafting
he would be made to answer for the
death of Tom Yick.
Budd received a setback, however,
when he called Foreman Andrews and
E. J. Bowes, the two members of the
jury who "sweated" the defendant.
They were the committeemen who
threatened Chan Cheung. But in find
ing the indictment for murder they had
refrained from voting, so no improper
motive could be laid bare there.
With Andrew M. Davts, another mem
ber of the police committee, the attor
neys for the prisoner had more success.
While Davis did not have anything to
do with the secret arrest of Chan
Cheung and the all-night tussle with
him at the Lick House, Davis talked
with Bowes and Andrews and learned
in a general way of what had occurred.
Notwithstanding that he had knowl
edge of what the police committee had
done in trying to force a confession
trom the Chinese, the juror voted to in
dict him for murder.
The disputed question of just how
far the defense can go in their inqui
ries as to the actions of the grand
jurors was not decided yesterday.
Bowes, Andrews, Davis, Stafford and
Secretary Bryan are to be recalled
when the case is taken up again next
Saturday morning. All the other jurors
were excused.
Meantime Chan Cheung, who is one ;
of the wealthiest men in Chinatown, j
must languish in the County Jail. Since I
his incarceration he has removed his
queue, covered the shaved parts with a
wig and altogether discarded Oriental
dress. He has undergone a thorough
course of Americanization since that
trying night when he baffled Andrews
and Bowes. They believe that they had
him at the point of confessing as thc
dawn appeared, and their mistake lay
in allowing him to fortify himself with
a hearty breakfast, for which he ex- ,
pressed dire need.
Three indictments were,presented by j

REFUSES TO CONTINUE

F. If. Yorke Company Notifies Board
of Works That It Will Proceed
If Bills Are Paid.
The F. M. Yorke Company yester
day formally notified the Board of
Public Works that It would not con
tinue the work of repairs to bitumin
ous pavements under its contract as
requested to do by the Finance Com
mittee of the Board of Supervisors.
The members of the company declared
that they would proceed with the
work only on condition that their bills
for August and â¢ September, which
have been held up b>\the committee,
be paid at once and that the specifica
tions under which the contract was
let be strictly complied with in the
future.
President Sehmitz of the Board of
Public Works immediately sent a com
munication to the Finance Committee
regarding the ultimatum of the com
pany'and a reply will be forthcoming
at to-morrow's meeting of the Finance
Committee. The Yorke Company not
only takes exception to the non-pay
ment of their demands, but bitterly
complains of the abrogation of its
contract to pave H street because the
Supervisors did not formally order the
work done, although an appropriation
was specifically made in the budget
for the improvement. It is pointed
cut that although the work of im
proving Nineteenth avenue also was
not ordered, yet George Cushing, to
whom was awarded the contract
therefor, has received his money for j
the work. It Is likely that some ac
tion will be taken by the Finance
Committee looking to the award of a j
new contract for repairing bitumin- !
ous pavements. .

CHINESE, BUSINESS MEN
BRING DISPUTE TO COURTS j
Wong Dean Claims That He Is Per
secuted by Commercial Rivals
Because of His Success.
A report reached this city, yester
day that the Chinese Minister at
Washington had been very much dis- !
pleased because the Chinese Vice Con- !
sul at this port had taken an active
part in the prosecution of Wong Dean
in a proceeding to have Wong deport
ed as a laborer. Wong is possessed of
considerable means and has been en
gaged in the business of selling dried
shrimps. He became involved in a
business dispute with a rival com
pany in which his friends say that the
Vice Consul has an interest.
Shortly after the beginning of the
dispute Wong was arrested for de
portation on the ground that he him
self had performed manual labor in
preparing shrimps for shipment. He
employed former Governor James H.
Budd to defend him and the case has
been heard by United States Commis
sioner Heacock.
Acting upon representations made
by the Chinese Minister, the Attorney
General has ordered a strict investiga
tion into the affair, with instructions,
should the case be one of prosecution
because of business rivalry, to have it
dismissed.

TOR TIAVS OEEENSE.
Rooney Brothers Escapades
BY JAMES C. CRAWFORD.
If the Barbary Coast were versed in ,
Shakespeare it probably would have
dubbed Tim and Jim Rooney "The Two
Dromios," but not being on familiar
terms with the Immortal Avonlte it
.aptly alludes to them as "The Just-
Alike Brothers." That the title is en
tirely fitting was averred by Patrol
man Brady, who had Jim before Judge
Mogan on the charge of vagrancy and
was confounded by the defensive pea >
that It was Tim he ought to have ar
rested, If arrest were Justified in the
premises. Specifically, Jim was . ac
cused of being the consort of Miss Dot- ;
tiÂ« <;<-,rizales. herself a thrice-convicted
vagrant, but she informed the court
that she did not know Jim at all, but
was rather intimately acquainted with
Tim. Her statement was confirmed by
b"th Jim and Tim, and there was noth
ing else the Judge could conscientiously
do than order Jim's dismissal and sug
gest to the dumfounded policeman that
he mieht save his face by filing a va
grancy charge against Tim and de
pending on the same testimony to ob
tain conviction. Ere the officer could
do that, however, both Tim and Jim
had disappeared.
It was not the first time that Jim's
and Tim's striking similarity of per
sonal appearance gait, voice, manner â
ev< '-ythingâdeveloped a comedy of er
rors. They enhance their physical re
spmblance by wearing garments, hats
and shoes that are as like as peas in
pods, and blunders of identity thus ef
fected have been numerous. It is po
lice gossip that the Rooneys were the
original subjects of the now-famous
appendicitis story. Jim was the strick
en one, the tale goes, but Tim was
removed to the hospital instead, where,
despite his protests, the surgeons ether
ized him and proceeded to operate.
When they found that his vermiform
appendix was in good condition, how
ever, they sewed up the incision, la
beled him Opened by Mistake," and
sent him home. In the meantime Jim
had so far recovered as to make the
extraction of his appendix no longer
necessary, and he retains the alleged
superfluous organ to this day.
It is also narrated that when Tim
took unto himself a bulldog of unique
coloring. Jim stole the animal and in
carcerated it until he found its fac
simile. Trouble as to the identity of
the dogs is prevented by canine in
stinct. The men may not be able to
distinguish one beast from the other,
but the beasts never err in their allegi
ance.
Many stories of mistaken recognition
by the fairer sex are told by both Jim
and Tim, but lack of space is not all
that prevents their recounts! in this
column.

"To your knees, ye sinners," he shout
ed, "for I can give you only about three
minutes to live! Pray lively, for time

Some of the dancers obeyed the be
hest, and others were too much fright
ened to do anything else than stand as
if transfixed. Two of the prescribed
three minutes elapsed when one of
the women emerged from her trance
and uttered a yell of terror that was
heard four blocks down Pacific street
and brought Patrolmen Skain and
Holmes to the spot just in the nick of
time to prevent the contemplated

escorted him to prison. leaving the ball

NEW PLAN FOR
APPORTIONMENT
School Measure Suggested
at Sacramento Would Add
Much to City's Burden
; COUNTRY TO REAP GAIN
: President Roncovieri Up in
! Arms and Will Seek to
i Make Effective Protest
A change in the manner of apportion
-1 ing State school moneys Is being agi- I
tated in Sacramento, whereby the â¢
country districts would reap much
gain, and the cities, particularly San
Francisco, suffer correspondingly. The
movement is being regarded with much
â¢ favor among the legislators from the
interior. Plans are already on foot in
' this city to oppose .what is regarded as
i unfair legislation.
It is proposed by some representa
'. fives who are working for the welfare
!of the rural districts to base the ap
portionments on the number of teach
ers and also on average daily attend
ance, instead of on the number of cen
sus children. It is urged for the most
part that the allowance from the State ;
iunds shall be $300 for each teacher.
The small districts would thereby
: gain a big advantage. The number of
their census children might be very
: small, but in large part they would be
on the same basis as San Francisco,
. where each teacher has a crowded
schoolroom.
' San Francisco's portion from State
school moneys would be reduced about
, $250,000 or $300,000 a year by the meas
j ure that has been suggested among the
I legislators," said President Roncovieri
jof the Board of Education last night,
i "The bill has not yet been prepared,
! but it seems to have enough advocates
:to justify this city in taking prompt
steps to present its side of the case.
San Francisco pays annually into the
State school funds about $1,300,000. Of
this we have been receiving back about
$860,000 in apportionments. It looks to
jme as if this city does handsomely for
the smaller schools of the State, where
wealth is lacking, and I think to im
; pose a burden of another quarter of a
j million dollars on us every year would
jbe very unjust.
I "Should the revenue for our schools
jbe reduced as much as would result
I from the proposed legislation, this city
| would have to meet the deficiency by
i taxing her citizens still more, or else
|to cut down our school term to seven
months."
Mr. Roncovieri said that he would
j try to start a non-partisan movement
i among all citizens to make appeal to
! the Legislature in behalf of San Fran
; Cisco's schools. He will at once ad
dress communications to the Mayor
i and the Board of Supervisors, calling
â¢ their attention to the situation, and
also seek tn have the Merchants' As-
I sociation and kindred organizations
give their aid in resisting the bill.

called "the most useful citizen in New

any man living to improve the condi
tion and environment of New York's

i ant reform which has been accom
-1 plished in New York in the last ten
, years in which Mr. Riis has not been
j a moving spirit. Many of the reforms
I were brought about when Theodore
i Roosevelt was Police Commissioner,

city.
shire and 18-year-old Charlie Potter
were commanded by Judge Cabaniss
to contribute to their respective 16
--year-old wives and one-month-old
babes. The young mothers were in
court with infants in arms and as they
faced the negligent spouses the group
was suggestive of children at play.
Willie is an apprentice cement work
er and earns $5 a week, 60 cents of
which he must hereafter give to his
better half to help her maintain the
baby. Charlie works in a cracker
factory and as he earns $7 a week and
his wife's parents are impoverished
he was ordered to transfer to her $2
every Saturday. Mr. Hampshire and
Mr. Potter exchanged condoling
glances when the Judge informed
them that all the machinery of the
court would be exercised in the en
forcement of his mandate, and the
little matrons gazed with mingled awe
and gratitude at the power that thus
fearlessly intimidated their young

effect that he dwelt south of Market
street and went to get shaved so far
north of the slot because he could
save 5 cents by so doing, the opera
tors there being novices acquiring
sufficient proficiency to enable them to
enter the professional rangs. As his
implied economy did not seem to have
the desired effect on the court he then
intimated that he was employed in the
college as "announcer." his duty be
ing to shout "Next!" when he saw a
chair vacated and was to designate
the customer who by right of longest

SEMPERVIRENS
CLUB IN FAVOR
OF RECESSION
The annual meeting of the Semper- \
virens Club was held at the St. Francis !
Hotel yesterday. Reports of officers of I
local clubs were read. John P. Irish de- !
livered an address on "Forestry Inter- j
ests of the State." The club is strongly
interested in the passage of a bill be
fore the State Legislature for an appro
priation to locate, survey and construct
a public highway to the Redwood Park
of the Big Basin in Santa Cruz County.
Touching upon this, Colonel Irish
spoke of the region as being the "most
glorious spot in all the Sierras, and not
to be surpassed in beauty in any other
mountainous portion of the globe."
A personal observation by Mr. Irish,
in company with David Starr Jordan
and Governor Perkins, had convinced
him that this "sylvan spot," as he ex
pressed it, should be set aside by our
State as a park. In general, on for
estry. Mr. Irish said our children knew
too little of its inner meaning. The re
lation of nature to man should be more
deeply inculcated in the minds of the
young, as an influence for refinement
emanates from contact with nature.
Mr. Irish spoke eloquently and for
cibly, emphasizing his sentiments
toward the recession of Yosemite to the
Federal Government. This was re
ceived with hearty and long sustained
applause. The Semperviiens <"lub has
Itself for the recession.
A edtnnsftttee Of five is to be ap
pointed from Ihe chair to present the
bill for a highway before our legisla
tors.
"With the Traveloguer" San Fran
ciscans.
Judging from the advance sale of seats
for the Burton Holmes Travelogues, to
be given at Lyric Hall, beginning next
Tuesday evening, this is to be the banner
season for Mr. Holmes in San Francisco.
Already the sale is nearly twice as large
as in any former year. Mr. Holmes' first
lecture,. "In London," will include views
of the principal centers of American in
terest, such as Piccadilly circus. St
James street, the Sunday "church pa
rade" and the "driving hour" in Hyde
Park, glimcses into the Ghetto on Sun
day, Petticoat lane, the tide of traffic at
the Bank of England and at the en
trance to the Tupenny tube. He will
also show a number of motion pictures
of the King and Prince of Wales, of the
Horse Guards, the Coldstream Guards
and the Scots Guards, and also a view of
the coronation procession, showing
Lords Kitchener and Roberts, the Beef
eaters and Indian escorts.
"Round About London," which will be
given on Thursday and Friday evenings,
deals more particularly with the envi
rons of London, and the Englishman
taking his holiday. As in ail of the

MAYOR SCHMITZ'S SELECTIONS FOR CHOICE POSITIONS IN THE MUNICI
PAL GOVERNMENT. OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT OF THEIR RESPECTIVE
APPOINTMENTS HAVING BEEN MADE BY HIS HONOR YESTERDAY.
Mayor Schmitz yesterday officially
announced the names of those whom
he has selected to succeed the mem
bers of the various municipal boards
and commissions whose terms will ex
pire to-morrow.
Dr. Joseph F. Poheim, present
member of the Board of Health, was
appointed Police Commissioner, a fact
which was frequently foreshadowed in
these columns for three weeks past.
The surprise of the day was the
resignation of Herbert Schmitz as
Ccmmissioner of Public Works and
the appointment of Edward H. Aigel
tinger as a member of the Works
Board. Aigeltinger was named to suc
ceed Michael Casey, thus securing, the
long term of three years. Thomas F.
Egan was appointed to Herbert
Schmitz's unexpired term of one year.
As predicted, the Mayor reappointed
School Director A. Altmann, Fire
Commissioner Henry .M. Wreden,
Election Commissioner A. W. Voor
sanger and Civil Service Commissioner
John W. Rogers to succeed them
selves.
The Mayor did not announce his
selection for the vacanacy on the Park
Commission, but intimated that Wil
liam H. Metson was the strongest can
didate thus far considered. Neither
did. his Honor appoint a successor on
the Board of Health to Dr. Poheim,
who was transferred to the Police
Commission.
Herbert Schmitz made a statement
that he had resigned because he did
not desire to assume the responsibility
placed upon members of the Board of
Works by a Superior Court decision
holding them lndividiually responsible
for damages accruing from accidents
due to defective sidewalks and streets.
Under the decision the Commissioners
may have to pay thousands of dollars
of damage claims. Furthermore,
Schmitz says that the Board of Works
has requested the Supervisors to pro
vide a sufficient appropriation to re
pair the streets and an inadequate al
lowance had been made, thus making
the possibility of accidents all the
greater. Under these conditions
Schmitz felt he could no longer con
tinue on the board, especially as his
health became impaired under the
strain.
SHAKE-UP IX PROSPECT.
Rumors were flying thick and fast
late yesterday afternoon that a shake
up was in prospect, whereby James de
Succa, secretary of the Park Commis
sion, will displace Morris Levy as sec
retary of the Board of Public Works
and Herbert Schmitz will be appointed
to his old position as secretary of the
Park Commission, from which he re
tired to become Public Works Com
missioner. The Mayor would not con
firm the rumor, though there seems to
be some ground for it. Alexander
O'Grady has been offered the secre
taryship of the Police Commission, but
may not take it. In all likelihood John
G. FitsgeralcL will succeed Egan as
storekeeper of the Board of Education.

as president of the Board of Health.
President Rogers of the Civil Service
Commission is willing to resign a twen
ty months* Incumbency of the honorary
position in favor of Commissioner
George H. Bahrs. who has one year yet
to serve. It is likely that Fire Com
missioner Parry will be elected presi
dent of the Fire Commission, to suc
ceed Boyne. and Election Commissioner
James A. Devoto will take the presi
dency now held by Election Commis
sioner Roberts. No intimation has been
given as to the prospective heads of the
Park and Police commissions, though
Commissioners William J. Dingee and
John A. Drlnkhouse are mentioned In
that connection for the respective pres.
idencies.
NEW POLICE COMMISSIONER.
Of the new appointees Dr. Poheim,
Police Commissioner, has been a mem
ber of the Health Board for one year.
He had Abe Ruef behind him for the
Police Commissionershlp, but his ap
pointment was not finally decided upon
until late Friday night.
Edward H. Aigeltinger, the new Com
missioner of Works, is a well-known
hay and coal merchant of this city. He
was a member of the Board of Super
visors In 1898 and 1899, having been
elected on the Republican ticket by a
large majority, and was chairman ot
the Street Committee during that pe
riod. He Is well qualified, both by ex
perience and natural ability, to fill the
position.
Thomas F. Egan, Commissioner of
Works, waa storekeeper of the Board
of Education before his advancement
to the former post. He is chairman of

MME. GADSKI
AT HER BEST
IN WAGNER
Madame Gadski surprised even her
most fervent admirers yesterday after
noon. It was her third recital, the pro
gramme all Wagner, and the Alhambra
crowded for the event. The singer that
can sing Wagner can sing anythingâ
but best. Wagner. And better Wagner
than Gadski's "Immolation Scene"
from the "Gotterdammerung" you will
not hear. It was a brilliantly dramatic
effort, backed up through every range
by a radiant vocal sufficiency. Even
the upper compass, that In the other
concerts wanted power, seemed here to
broaden to the full need. It was a
magnificent triumph of temperament, a
triumph of artistry. A lovely Elsa and
Elizabeth one has always known her;
here she became par excellence the
Brunnhilde, Isolde.
She began with Elizabeth's "Dich,
teure Halle." and one saw her again
in the Wartburg greeting the stately
hall. Followed then the "Elsa'e
Traume," full of moo-nlight and mys
teryâand almost one caught an echo of
Ortrud's sinister chant. I heard Gad
ski first in the "Senta's Ballad"; her
wonderful development was yesterday
hardly anywhere more evident than
here. She gave as encore the "Aus
Meinen Grossen Schmerzen"âas well
sung as on the first night. As
Isolde she sang the "Tristan" studies.
"Traume," "Engel," "Schmerzen" and
"Wiegenlied," the last vociferously en
cored, repeated, and the "Roeslein, Roes
lein," given as encore to that. The scene
from the "Gotterdammerung" closed
the programme,"and this encored, one
left with the immortal cry of Brunn
hilde ringing royally in one's ears.
Mr. Meyrbwitz accompanied as well
as Gadski sang. One hardly missed
the orchestra. He gave also three
solos from the "Walkure," "Tristan
and Isolde," and "Gotterdammerung."
An extra concert for next Sunday
afternoon has been arranged.

for when Bonner started away first
with Tocolaw he was joined by the
Ryan entry. The *iair raced off clear
of the field, but as the stretch was
reached Tocolaw, cracked and it
looked easy sailing for iioniton. Under
vigorous, handling, Martinm:is now
loomed up as the contender. Kunz
made every effort with him, but to no
avail, Honiton, under a perfect ride,
winning by nearly a length in 1:26%.
Tocolaw disposed of Toledo for third
money.
The one startling surprise of the
aiternoon was the win of Gossiper,
which defeated a clever field at odds
Ot 25 to f. Sir Wilfred and Ananias
were the only successful favorites.
No doubt after his ghastly showing
In the introductory sprint Vesuvian
will be retired. In fact it will be com
pulsory on the part of Walter Jen
nings, for the old horse pulled up on
three legs. He went to the post a 3
to 5 favorite and ran fifth. The Cure,
ridden by Davis and 6 to 1 in the bet
ting, went out in front and was never
headed. Dr. Sherman, at 50 to 1,
tcok the place from Waterspout, a
100 to 1 shot.
GOSSIPER, AN OUTSIDER, WINS.
A six-furlong selling affair for three
year-olds ended in an awful turn over
for the talent. Silverskin, the gray
sprinter from the Brinkworth stable,
looked like a real meilow one and even
money a fair quotation. Despite the
money bet on him the price about Sil
verskin went back in the betting.
Travers, who rode the favorite, made
a kid glove soiree of it and cneaked
h; third. Gossiper, a 25 to 1 shot,
which carried some scattered support
and was piloted by Kunz, made a run
away race of it. Salable finished very
strong on the~ outside, only losing by
a neck. M. A. Powell got away very
badly.
In the two-year-old event, at three
and a half furlongs. Sir Wilfred, the
fast colt from the Cameron string,
turned the tables on the Napa Stock
Farm's Daruma. The victory of Sir
Wilfred last Wednesday was such an
impressive one that he ruled favorite
over the filly. Bullman had the mount
on Daruma, and she easily outfooted
Sir Wilfred to the turn for home. Right
here Jakie Jones, astride the favorite,
won the race. His mount was more than
two lengths to the bad, but Bullman
made a sweeping turn and the first
choice saved three lengths by making
a close cut on the rail. This gave Sir
Wilfred the lead, and in a struggle to
the wire he held the filly safe, winning
by a length. Abe Meyer* again finished
third.
Travers on Nigrette furnished a dis
graceful exhibition, and after opening
up a 3 to 2 favorite for the mile and
a furlong selling run the black mare
finished unplaced; The smart money
went in on Leila, and, permitted to
make her own pace, the Clark entry,
with Greenfield up, registered first, of
course. Davis laid away with Major
Mansir, getting up, however, in time to
nose out Stilicho for the place.
Johnny Schorr's Ananias picked up
110 pounds and John Bullman and made
a runaway race of the mile and fifty
yard handicap. Ishlana finished sec
ond, eight lengths before Venator.
TRACK NOTES.
Vesuvian pulled up in such bad shape
that the turf has probably seen the
last of the once good racehorse. When
the son of St. Andrew cannot finish
one, two, three in a cheap selling race
It is time he was retired.
Piatt, from the Stevens stable, heav
ily played to win the second event,
broke down.
Brinkworth & Co. lost Major Mansir
from the fifth race. The old cam
paigner was claimed for $1925 by George
March, trainer of Vaughan.
An examination of Follow Me, which
ran unplaced in a race on Friday when
a hot favorite, discloses the fact that
the gelding has a sore foot. Judge Pet
tingill says the wound looks as if it
may have been caused by being pricked
when plated. The owners of Follow
Me lost their own money, as did their
friends. If every horse won that was
heavily played and owners-and train
ers were never wrong in their surmises
bookmakers would soon be a memory
of the past.
Walter Jennings will appeal to the
stewards of the Pacific Jockey Club
from the decision of Judge Hamilton of
Los Angeles In awarding "Big Bill"
Knapp, the jockey, to Puerl Wilkerson.
The latter has two or three crabs that
wotddn't make a stew at Port Arthur,
and It seems strange that he must
have a rider under contract. Why does
he require one?
Johnny Schorr's Ananias cut the
coast record for one mile and fifty
yards from 1:42% to 1:42 flat. The
American record of 1:41 1-5 is held by
Haviland, made at Chicago.
Travers rode an Illy judged race on
Silverskin, to say the least, but his ex
hibition on Nigrette waa shameful. The
marc could have gone to the front on
the back stretch, but Travers looked
for an opportunity to get cut off In
stead. It was such a flagrant piece of
criminally bad riding that the judges
decided to restrict the boy's riding in
future to the stable of Dr. Rowell.
Travers* apprentice allowance expires
on the 12th inst., and he can thank his
lucky stars that the officials did not
rule him off the turf. Travers has fur
nished many peculiar-looking rides,
and the horses' odds usually receded in
the betting.
Lagoria * Forbes will sell Edrodun

HYLAND AND NEIL AGREE
UPON TERMS OF BATTLE
Both Men Deiwsit Forfeits and Select
Alex Greggains to Referee
. the Bout.
Frankie Neil and Dick Hyland
agreed upon terms yesterday after
noon for a twenty-round fight. After
a lengthy argument McClintic, Hy
land's manager, finally gave in and
agreed to pit his boy against the for
mer bantam champion at 122 pounds
ringside. Both men seemed willing to
battle for 60 per cent of the gross re
ceipts and to divide the profits 65 and
35 per cent.
The date of the match has been
shifted from the 27th inst. to the 31st
in order to give the boys a chance to
train a few days longer. Both seem
satisfied with 'Alex Greggains as a ref
eree and he has consented to judge
the bout. Each man deposited fIOOO
with Bob Smith as a guarantee for
weight and appearance.
Alex Greggains will probably sign
up Bobby Johnson and Billy Snail
ham for the main preliminary. He
is also trying to match Frank Rafael
and George Herbert for a ten-round
bout as a curtain raiser. There seems
little chance of bringing Berger and
Casey together, as the former insists
he is still an "amateur."

FIST FINISHES
IN PONY RACES
Cacahaute Leads Morning
Glory Half a Length to
Wire in a Pretty Race]
SPEEDY BECKY BEATEN
Surprise Is Sprung When
F. J. Carolan Comes Home
First on Fanny Anderson
A smart assemblage gathered at C.
W. Clark's private track at San Mateo
yesterday afternoon to witness Cali
fornia's fleetest ponies match their
strides in six exciting events. The
weather was a bit crisp and was all
that could be desired. The track was
in splendid shape, and the time was
fast. The fifth race on the card, the
one mile event, stands out as the con
test of the day. Frank Skinner, sport
ing the colors of Rudolph Spreckels,
piloted Cacahaute home half a length
before R. M. Tobin on C. W. Clark's
Morning Glory.
A prettier race between little horses
was never decided on any track. Five
were entered originally, but the bal
ance, including F. J. Carolan's Fusi
lade, had been scratched, leaving but
two to compete. The betting was live
ly, with odds about even, and when
the pair started a ripple of applause
went up, for every one was aware that
a contest worth viewing was to be
waged.
Mr. Tobin took the lead In the first
Quarter, with Frank Skinner in close
attendance. At the half-mile post they
were riding: neck and necic. There was
no change at the three-quarter station,
and when they thundered down the
stretch it looked like a dead heat. In
the final few yards Morning Glory tired
a bit, and Skinner gave Cacahaute the
whip. The latter gained steadily at
the critical moment and beat his game
opponent half a length under the wire.
The 3ensation of the day developed
in the second race, when Fanny An
derson, the Denver pony, made the
spectators open wide their eyes by fin
ishing a length in front of Rudolph
Spreekels' Becky, which every one
thought the surest winner of the day.
Francis J. Carolan rode the winner
cleverly, and she had the race well in
hand throughout. Becky got into the
going too late, as at the finish she was
fast closing in on the victor.
The fourth event went to Alvemie
in a hard drive, with Queen Rucker and
Althcmer following close at her heels.
Frank Skinner, on Lady Gay, was left
at the post to the dismay of his ad
mirers. Starter Havey experienced
much difficulty in getting the field
away, and Lady Gay was not In the
best of temper.
W. S. Hobart's Marigold, with Char
ley Dunphy as pilot, brought home the
money in the last event. Silver Dick

LOS ANGELES, Jan. 7.âEvery win
ning horse at Ascot to-day was played
to an almost unlimited extent and, al
though favorites were not generally
successful, the books suffered a terrific
blow. One of them, which had laid the
highest price against Oxford, winner of
the Pasadena handicap, quit bu f

severely when Tim Hurst won the last

the first, second and third races to
day, decided to quit business.
The Pasadena handicap was the fea

made favorite with Oxford a strong

from Heather Honey, with Ethylene

fourth race, scored another victory over
Luckett and Felipe Lugo in 1:13% for

ous Tournament Matches
The new three-time tennis cups com
peted for for the first time on the
Golden Gate Park courts yesterday
were won by Miss Anabelle Vodden
and Miss Golda Myer, playing from
scratch. In the finals they met Misa
Dorothy Weed and Miss Sorita Van
Vleit, another scratch team. This
match went the full three seta. The
losers won the first set Quite easily
by a 6â3 score, but Miss Crocker and
Miss Myer played a good up-hill game
and won the second and third sets.
The handicapping was exceptionally
well done, as the scores show. Miss
Wegener and Miss Watson and Misa
Jones and Miss Worcester, the two
most heavily handicapped teams, had
several close matches and were beaten
after a hard fight.
The closest match of the day waa
that between Miss E. Hess and Misa
Vera Beyfuss and Miss Wegener and
Mrs. Watson. The former received
odds of "3-6," while their opponents
"owed 15 3-6." The odds were large,
but Miss Wegener and Mrs. Watson
managed to win out. The first set
went to the winners by a 12â10 score.
Miss Beyfuss and Miss Hess won the
second set easily, but lost the third
6â4.
Miss Vodden and Miss Myer had
their hardest match in the first round.
They received owe odds of "15 3-6" and
after losing the first set pulled out the
next two and won with nothing to
spare.
Both semi-final matches went in
straight sets, but they were close. The
scores follow:
Miss Anabelle Vodden and Miss
Golda Myer (scratch), beat Miss E.
Jones and Miss Worcester (owe 15 3-6),
3â6, 7â5, 6â4; Mrs. Watson and Miss
Lulu Wegener (owe 15 3-6), beat Miss
Vera Beyfuss and Miss E. Hess (3-6),
12â10, 2âB, 6â4; Miss Sarita Van
Vliet and Miss D. Weed (scratch), beat
Miss G. Saylor and Miss E. Noble
(15), 6-4, 6â4.
Semi-finalsâMiss Vodden and Miss
Myer beat Miss Wegener and Mrs.
Watson, 6â2; Miss Weed and
Miss Van Vliet beat Miss Mearns and
Miss (owe 3-6), 6â4, 7â5.
FinalsâMiss Vodden and Miss Myer
beat Miss Weed and Miss Van Vliet,
3â6, 6â2, 6â4.
Six continuous tournament matches
were played by the boyÃ at the park,
two matches in each class. In the
first class H. Getz (1) beat R. Strachan
(2), 2â6, 6â4. 7â5, and M. McLough
lin (4) beat R. Strachan (2). 2â6, 6â4,

Some good practice matches were
played on the California Club courts,
most of which were doubles. Herbert

TIDAL WAVES
FLOOD TOWNS
Enormous Loss on the East
Coast of England Follows
a Sudden Rise of the Ocean
LONDON, Jan. 7.âA tidal flood on
the east coast this morning caused an
enormous amount of damage at water
ing places from Scarborough as far
south as Dover. Eight hundred feet
of the pier at Scarborough, which cost
$175,000, were swept away, and the
promenades on the sea front were
* broken up. Nearly- all parts of the
town of Yarmouth were inundated,
hundreds of houses were flooded and
the inhabitants were obliged to vacate
the ground floors. The esplanade and
each gardens were swept bare. Big*
blocks of concrete were tossed about,
v recking everything they came in con
tact with.
Similar destruction was caused else
Â°where. Sea.wails were washed away
and waves swept over adjoining es
rl>lÂ»nsdes, destroying numerous costly
permanent attractions, inundating
houses', churches and stores and caus
iiig immense looses both to corpora
tions and individuals.
BERLIN, Jan. 7. âA storm that is
I raging on the north coast of Germany
â equals in intesity the one of a week

inundated by the inrushing waters
from the sea. The flood threatens to
destroy the protected dyke near the
mouth of the River Elbe and large dc
i. > hm'ents from the neighboring garri
sona are at work strengthening it. The
damage already done is heavy.
Shipping generally was warned of
I the approach of the storm. At Cux

the President. It will be of indeter

DESPERATE MAN
LANDS IN JAIL
John Umland, a Bartender,
Frustrates Plan of Bold
Burglar in Plucky Manner
THIEF TEIES TO SHOOT
Pistol Hangs Fire and Pur
suer Grapples With Thug
and Soon Overpowers Him
A shrewdly planned robbery waa
frustrated yesterday by John Umland,
a bartender employed by Claus Tiede
mann, a grocer at Polk and Turk
streets. I'm land broke open a door be
hind which the robber had bolted him,
and, though a pistol was snapped at
him by the thug, the plucky bartender j
followed the fellow along Polk street.
Dodging under the weapon, Umland '
grappled with the robber. Dr. Charles
Flury went to the bartender's assist
ance and the two held the thug until
the arrival of Policeman Cracke. At
the City Hall station the thug gave the
name of John Archer.
Archer's plan was a clever one, and
would have been successful but for the
persistence of Umland. Archer entered
the barroom in the rear of the grocery
and strolled quietly into the lavatory.
"Say," called he, "this place is flooded."
Umland hurried Into the lavatory to
investigate. The instant he entered
Archer darted out and bolted the bar
tender in. The robber then went to the
cash register and wrenched open the
drawer. Umland threw his whole
weight against the door and burst it
open before Archer had time to secure
the $200 In the register. The robber
fled and the bartender followed, raising
the crysÂ»f "Stop thief!"
Umland gained upon 1 the thug, who
suddenly halted and pointed a pistol
at him. The trigger snapped, but the
cartridge did not explode. Before
Archer had time to try another shot
Umland grappled with him and the pair
fell to the pavement. Then it was that
Dr. Charges Flury went to Umland's
assistance, and the pair had Archer
beaten into submission by the time
Policeman Cracke arrived.
Archer was charged with burglary
and assault with a deadly weapon. He
admitted trying to rob the place, say
ing that he was penniless and des
perate.
C. Terry, who was near the store
when the robbery was attempted, says
that he saw a man watching on the
outside while Archer was within. The
police are looking for this man, whom
they believe was a confederate of the
thug. The manner of executing the
attempted robbery shows that it was
carefully planned.
EMIGRANT INSPECTION
LAWS ARE DISCUSSED
Steamship and Railway Men Hold an
Important Conference In
New York.
NEW YORK, Jan. 7.âCommittees
from the principal Atlantic steamship
lines and the important railway lines
affected met here to-day to consider
alleged abuses of the emigrant inspec
tion laws, as far as they relate to the
examination of persons passing
through this country en route to Eu
rope. These committees claim, ac
cording to a statement made to-day,
that Federal Inspectors of the Depart
j ment of Commerce and Labor by an
j unnecessarily rigid and Searching ex
; amination of these persons are so an
| ncying and intimidating to such cmi
' grants as to cause them to take
steamships from Canadian rather than
American ports.
It was said that one result of to
day's meeting probably would be an
application to Secretary Metcalf of the
Department of Commerce and Labor
asking that he issue to the department
inspectors such instructions as will
bring about a change in their methods
and do away with the alleged annoy
ance to emigrants.

Manager of "Get-Rich-Quick" Com
pany. Accused of Embezzlement,
1 , Says Funds Are Intact.
SAN JOSE. Jan. 7.â0. J. Watkins,
manager of the San Jose Mercantile
Company, who was arrested in San
Francisco yesterday, was brought here
tc-day to answer to a charge of em
bezzlement. He is accused of having
misapporpirated $5000 belonging to
contract-holders of the company. In
lieu of $10,000 bonds Watkins was
compelled to go to Jail. His examina
tion was set for January 14. The com
plaint of embezzlement was made by
Joseph A. Cottle? an orchardist, resid
ing near this city.
The company is believed to have no
assets, as the fixtures and carpets in
the office have been mortgaged. Eighty
per cent of the receipts of the com
pany were supposed to have gone into
! a redemption fund. Watkins declares
j the contracts will be paid in full, but
i that none of them are yet due, as the
company has been running only twen
ty six weeks and contracts do not ma
ture for eighty weeks. He says the re
demption fund is intact.
MIDSHIPMAN ARRAIGNED

a Thief.
PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 7.âRich
ard Mann, a midshipman in the Unit
ed States Naval Academy at Annapo
lis, was held in $300 bail for a fur
ther hearing by a magistrate here to
day, charged with assault and battery.
Mann ,came here last November
with a battalion of midshipmen to at
tend the army and navy football
game. According to the story told to
the magistrate, John Lyons, aged 11
years, of this city, grabbed Mann's
megaphone and ran off with it, Mann,
it is asserted, gave chase and when he
caught the fugitive a scuffle ensued,
during which Lyons was kicked and
severely injured. He was a patient in
the University Hospital until yester
day.
Mann was brought from Annapolis
and Lyons appeared against him "to
day. The magistrate expressed the
opinion that any person had the right
to pursue a thief, but he continued the
case In order to give Lyons an oppor
tunity to show, if possible, that the as
sault upon him was unlawful.

SON SENDS HIM
TO IN ASYLUM
Brodie S. Duke, Millionaire,
Committed to Sanitarium
Because of a Marriage
SEQUEL TO ROMANCE
Woman Member of an In
* vest ment Firm Is Bride
Whom Eelatives Oppose
NEW YORK, Jan. 7.âA man said to
be Brodie S. Duke, 58 years of age, was
taken from the psychopathic ward of
Bellevue Hospital to-night by central
office detectives and transferred to a
private sanitarium. Duke was admit
ted to the hosyital on Friday night,
having been committed by Justice
Wyatt. The complainant is said to
have been a son of Duke. Among the
effects in Duke's possession when he
was received at the hospital is said to
have been $40,000 in bonds. It was re>
ported that the property clerk of the
hospital was summuned to appear to
day before the Grand Jury with the ef
fects found in Duke's possession, and
he did so.
According to the hospital record of
the case, William Lindsey. former Sen
ator from Kentucky, was given as
Duke's lawyer. District Attorney
Jerome said he knew nothing about the
case or any connection with the Grand
Jury, but it is alleged the Bellevue Hos
pital property clerk took to Jerome's
office to-day $40,000 in stocks and bonds
of various enterprises in Durham, N.
C, and three notes for $5000 each,
signed by Brodie S. Duke, and in favor
of Alice Webb. The notes were dated
December 15 and were to mature in
two, three and five months, respec
tively.
Alice Webb is said by the manage
ment of a hotel where she stays while
in town, to be a member of the firm of
Taylor, Webb & Co., an investment
concern with offices in Chicago.
W. E. Shepherd, a hotel detective,
said that Brodie S. Duke became a
guest in the Park-avenue Hotel late
in October and that about two weeks
ago Duke and Miss Webb were mar
ried by one of Rev. Dr. Charles H.
Parkhurst'B assistants. It is because
of this marriage that Duke's son has
caused him to be placed in a sanita
rium.
Duke is said to be a millionaire and
to own much property in California.

SING THOUGH
DEATH IS NEAR
Members of Chorus Continue
Song and Hide From Audi
ence Disaster on the Stage
NEW YORK, Jan. 7.âMore than
twenty members of the chorus of the
Metropolitan Grand Opera Company
were seriously injured to-night by the
collapse of the bridge in the street
scene in the opening act of "Carmen."
None of the principals were on the
stage at the time of the accident, and
the uninjured members of the chorus
heroically massed at the front of the
stage and sang on in an attempt to
Drevent the public from learning what
had happened. The curtain was rung
down as soon as possible, and Hein
rich Conreid, the impresario, prevented
a panic by urging the great audience
to remain seated and not be fright
ened.
All of the exits of the theater were
opened immediately after the accident,
but scarcely half a dozen persons of
the handsomely dressed audience left
their seats. Within fifteen minutes
after the crash the performance was
resumed, and few persons in the big
theater realized how serious the acci
dent had been.
At the close of the performance
Frank P. Palmer, master mechanic of
the Metropolitan, was arrested and
locked up in a police station, charged
with criminal negligence. Palmer, who
refused to make any statement, will
be arraigned In court to-morrow morn
ing.

GERMAN MINERS
IN ANGRY MOOD
Embittered by Failure $f
Operators to Answer Their
Demand for a Shorter Day
BERLIN, Jan. 7.âMeetings of the
representatives of 200,000 miners em
ployed in the mines of the Rhenish
Weatphalian Coal Syndicate are being
held throughout the district regarding
the silence of the members of the syn
dicate on the workmen's request for a
different system of measuring the
hours of work. The mines are under
individual company management, the
whole allotted product being marketed
by the synidcate. Two hundred and
fifty, men in one mine refused to work
to-day, but a general strike is not yet
in imminent prospect, although the
miners are embittered by the long
controversy.
The miners ask that the hours of
work shall be measured from the time
of arrival at the pit's mouth until they
reach the pit's mouth on returning,
instead of from the time of reaching
the work gallery until quitting time.
The men affirm that it takes forty-five
minutes each way, going Into and leav
ing the deep sunk shafts and long gal
leries, so that a nominal eight-hour
day becomes a day of nine and a half
hours. They asked for the first year a
nine-hour day, for the second year
eight and one-quarter hours, and for
the third year and thereafter eight
hours calculated between getting into
and coming out of the entrance.
The miners aver that the diggings
are more unhealthy than ever and that
56 per cent of the men are now dis
eased. According to official reports
the average life of miners is less than
formerly. The miners' leaders urge
moderation and the observance of or
der. The public generally is deeply in
terested in the result of ihe dispute.
The coal syndicate's contract, which
went into effect in April. 1904, for
twelve years, fixes the allotment of
each mine for the entire period. The
result is that the powerful mining com
panies are mining economically', buying
up the weaker ones and closing them,
supplying their allotment from new
shafts of the large mines- The work
men of the small mines are forced to
sell their cottages at a sacrifice and
move to the large mines.
There are Government representa
tives at the meetings of the miners and
police and troops are held ready to
suppress disturbances.

TERRORISTS DESTROY
x LARGE BAND OP SHEEP
%
PORTLAND, Or., Jan. 7.âWith
axes, knives and clubs a gang of un
known terrorists broke into the sheep
fold of Fred Smith in the Suplee sec
tion of Crook County and destroyed a
band of 430 sheep. The sight that met
the eyes of the owner when he dis
covered his loss on New Year's day
was frightful. Strewn about were the
dead and wounded bodies of his herd.
The bleating of those still living was
pitiful to hear. Smith had ranged his
band on his own property and that
leased from the military wagon road
company and the slaughter is Inex
plicable on any other grounds than
that of a war on the wool bearers.

St. Paul's Cathedral in
Serious Danger Because of
Underground Honeycomb
Special Cable to The Call and New York
Herald. Copyright. 1906. by the New York
Herald Publishing Company.
LONDON, Jan. 7.âThe old cry is
raised again of dangers attending the
undermining of London by the honey
comb of underground ejectric rail
ways. St. Paul's Cathedral, the Bank
of England and Westminster Abbey
are all reported In imminent danger
and this time the alarm appears Jus
tified regarding St. Paul's, notwith
standing the denials of the cathedral
authorities.
Experts remain insistent that the
danger has become serious. The foun
dations are sinking as the natural and
inevitable consequence of the pumping
which has accompanied the work of
driving the various tunnels that have
been conatructed and others which are
still In progress In the immediate
vicinity.
The experts go still further and say
this incessant tunneling, which is pro
ceeding in all parts of London, Is Im
periling the entire metropolis.

MANAGER CALVIN PAYS
SAX FRAXC1SCO A VISEC
E. E. Calvin, general manager of the
Oregon Railroad and Navigation Com
pany and the Southern Pacific Com
pany's lines in Oregon, has been in
San Francisco for several days. He
apparently did not wish to make his
presence here known and for that rea
son remained away from the offices of
the Southern Pacific until hia depart
ure yesterday for south, where he
will meet Julius Krut'tschnitt, director
of maintenance of the Harriman lines,
who is making a tour of inspection of
the western division.
The presence of Calvin In San Fran
cisco on the eve of Kruttschnitt's ar
rival in this State has stimulated spec
ulation in railroad circles as to who
is to be made general manager of the
Southern Pacific. Many think that
Calvin is slated for the place, while
others believe that Bancroft will be
the man, notwithstanding that the lat
ter has told his intimate friends that
he does not want the position.. Among
a few of the more prominent officials
of the company there is a favored
theory that Bancroft will get the po
sition and that his duties as general
manager of the Oregon Short Line will
be assigned to Calvin, in connection
with his duties as general manager of
the Oregon Railroad and Navigation
Company. To these railroad officials
the consolidation of the managerial re
sponsibilities of the Oregon Short
Line and the Oregon Railroad and
Navigation Is regarded as practicable,
inasmuch as the roads are practically
one system.

MUCH GOOD WILL COME OF REVIVAL
Preparations for Receiving Evangelists at the
Great Rally to Take Place Next March.
OAKLAND, Jan. 7.âPreparations for
the great evangelistic rally, which is
to be held in this city next March, are
being rapidly completed and the com
mittees in charge of the arrangements
are now giving their attention to minor
details of the prospective meetings,
which are to be held simultaneously
in different parts of the city.
The evangelists who are to conduct
the services in Oakland are now in
: Denver, Colorado, where they will hold
services until January 22. From there
they will go to Los Angeles, where
meetings will be held until February
17. At the close of the Los Angeles
rally they will come to this city. The
services will begin on March 5 and
will continue for two weeks.
Reports from Eastern cities where
the evangelists have conducted ser
vices tell of the great success of their
work. In Binghamton, N. V., 2000 were
converted during the meetings and at
Colorado Springs, at the closing meet
ing, ,500 people signified their intention
of loading a Christian life. More than
two hundred of the merchants of Col
orado Springs closed their stores on
the Thursday before Christmas that
their employes might have an oppor
tunity to hear the evangelists.
The committee in charge of the mu
sic for the revival is now completing
the organization of four great choruses,
and the rehearsals of these choruses
will begin in a short time.
The arrangements for the meetings in
the districts of the city will be directed
by three sets of committees* as fol
lows: Central district, Rev. Charles R.
Brown president, Rev. H. J. Vosburgh
vice president; East Oakland district,
Rev. Owen Hotle president, Rev. Rob
ert Whitaker vice president; West Oak
land district, Rev, J. C. Bolster presi
dent, H. F. Burgess vice president.
There will be a meeting of the gen
eral committee which has supervision
of the campaign on next Monday even
ing in the First Presbyterian Church,
at which time it is expected that it will
be definitely decided what evangelists
will be assigned to each district. The
officers of the general committee are:
President, Rev. E. E. Baker; vice pres
ident. Rev. E. R. Dille; secretary, S. P.
Meads; treasurer, S. M. Dodge; press
committee. Earl S. Bingham, H. B.
Mowbray and I. N. Halliday; music
committee, Dr. 0...5. Dean, W. B. Rag
land and Dr. Ray E. Gilson; finance
committee. E. S. Finch. S. M. Dodge,
Irvin Ayres, J. H. Stevens and C. E.
Cornell. There are also twenty-two
other members, one pastor and one lay
man representing each of the eleven
denominations.
Carl S. Bingham, the chairman of
the press committee, in discussing the
coming revival, said:
' Rvangelistic movements have been
successes or failures in proportion to
the interest taken by the Christians of
the community in which they have
*been held. The Oakland church mem
bers have reason to look forward with
confidence to the great meetings to be
held in March, when four of the most
noted evangelists of the country are
to conduct services for two weeks, if
the large attendance at the week of
prayer services is to be taken as any
significance of the interest taken in
the evangelistic campaign."
CLAIMS TO BE HEIR TO
THE HARTERY ESTATES
Kate Flat ton Will Endeavor to Gather
Properties Left by Mother
and Stepfather.
OAKLAND, Jan. 7.âMrs. Kate Hat
ton has petitioned the courts for let
tern of administration on the estate
of her mother, Louise Hartery of Hay
wards, as being her only heir, and
proposes also to get together what was
left of the estate of her late step
father, Michael Hartery, who com
mitted suicide last March, leaving a
note in which he directed the Oakland
Bank of Savings to give his wife what
money he had on deposit, amounting
to about 52500. A week prior to his
death Hartery gave away a $10,000
ranch to James F. Reynolds, president
of the Oakland Meat Company.
The note was offered as a will by
James Hartery and Mary Walsh,
brother and sister of the deceased, as
it left undisposed of an estate sup
posed to be worth about $25,000, of
which they could claim their share.
Judge W. E. Greene, however, held
that Hartery was insane when he
wrote the note and intimated that he
was Insane when he deeded the ranch
to Reynolds. This ruling left in force
a will made some years previously,
leaving everything to his wife. As her
mother's heir Mrs. Hatton is entitled
to all that was left to her mother by
the will and will begin proceedings
against Reynolds to recover the Har
tery homestead at Haywards.

Berkeley Institution Decides
to Wind Up Its Affairs
and Go Out of Business
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,

Despairing of securing sufficient de
posits to warrant the continuation of
his banking business, F. S. Page, presi
dent of the Merchants' Bank, at 2265

intention of closing the doors of the in

The Merchants* Bank will cease to do

will close its doors. The bank is per

as the Conservative candidate for
Parliament. Aa they neared the

poster, . atopped the carriage and,
calling his frlend'a attention to it, re
marked. "It, la something about you."
Disraeli read the words printed in
large letters, "Judgment debts of Ben

Shrewsbury." Underneath waa a list
of debts upon which judgment had
been signed. This he perused care
fully. Then he turned to Sir Philip
and said placidly, "How accurate It is!
Now let us go on or wa will be late."

FORGER LEAVES
A WARM TRAIL
Police of Berkeley Learn of
Recent Doings in Case
of Adroit Check Passer
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, Jan. 7.
Jean Galan is the latest victim of the
forger whose bogus checks have been
accepted with such dismal results dur
ing the last few days by many mer
chants of Berkeley. Galan is a wine
maker at Ninth street and San Pablo
avenue. West Berkeley.
Marshal Kerns to-day received from
Galan the bogus check which "J.
Woerdt" passed at the winery last
Wednesday. The amount which the
stranger got from Galan was only $5,
but the Frenchman was intensely agi
tated over the matter, more, he said,
because his confidence had been be
trayed than because of the monetary
loss. The stranger had represented
himself as an employe of the Spring
Rock Construction Company, and the
check he worked off on the winemaker
was signed with the forged name of
Charles F. Cole, agent for the company
in Berkeley.
Galan says the swindler told him of
having been treated by Dr. H. N.
Rowell last Tuesday for a sprained
wrist and that Dr. RoWell had ordered
him to a hospital. The police, acting
on this clew, learned that a man giv
ing the name of "Woerdt" had consult
ed Dr. Rowell last Tuesday for an in
jured arm. With this scent upon which
to work the police are confident that
"Woerdt." who has made no attempt
apparently to cover his trail, will soon
be landed behind the oars.
Oldest Self-Striking Clock.
In the north transept of Wells cathe
ral, England, may be seen the oldest
self-striking clock with a count wheel
in the world, having been constructed
by Peter Lightfoot about 1320. This
timepiece contains many devices which
testify to the ancient horologisfs in
genuity. Several celestial and terres
trial bodies are incorporated in inter
esting movement and relationship.
They indicate the hours of the day, the
agi> of the moon, and the position of
the planets and the tides. When the
clock strikes the hour horsemen fully
armed dash out of two gateways in
opposite directions, and charge furi
ously. They strike with their lances
as they pass, as many times as corre
sponds with the number of the hour.
A little distance away is seated upon
a high perch a quaint figure, which
kicks the quarters on two bells placed
beneath his feet, and strikes the hours
on a bell. The dial of the clock is
divided into twenty-four hours, and In
dicates the phases of the moon and a
map of the heavens. Outside the tran
sept is another large dial and two bells,
on which two armored knights strike
the quarters, each with his halbert,
and which are said to be actuated by
the mechanism of the clock inside.â

High Prices Induce Hunters.
Naturalists are beginning to wonder
how long the annual slaughter can con
tinue without exterminating the fur
bearing species. The most valuable of
these are already seriously diminished.
The sea otter, an animal weighing
from 40 to 60 pounds, formerly abun
dant on the coast of Kamchatka and i
the Aleutian Islands, is rapidly ap
proaching extinction. From $1500 to
$2500 has been paid for single skins.
Several of these skins, valued at from
$1000 to $2000 each, were exhibited at
the St. Louis Exposition. The Ameri
can silver or black fox sells for from
$500 up. It was stated that n single
black pelt brought $8000 in St. Peters
burg. Three of these skins were shown
at St. Louis, valued at $6000. The fur
seal catch is diminishing every year,
and the price of the fur la rising; the
same seems to be true of ermine. Al
though the sales of Russian sable have
increased during recent years, the fact
that unusually fine skins will fetch
from $250 up suggests that the supply
is limited. The ermine and the sable
are both small animals of the weasel
family, each pelt furnishing but a few
square inches of fur.âNew York Globe.

Burglars and Highwaymen
Cause a Reign of Terror
Among Alameda Residents
ALAMEDA, Jan. 7.âlra W. Klbby
was last night held up by a lone foot
pad armed with a club. The highway
man met him while he was going to his
home on College avenue, and brandish
ing his wooden weapon commanded
him to throw up his hands. Instead of
complying Kibby quickly backed away
from the robber, and when he made a
motion as if to draw a pistol the thug
took to his heels.
A. M. Roebke of 1100 College avenue
telephoned to the City Prison about the
hold-up and Policeman Theodore An
derson was detailed to Investigate. He
was unable to obtain a description of
the highwayman from Kibby, who was
badly frightened. A search of the
neighborhood failed to reveal any trace
of the footpad.
As a result of the numerous burg
laries and hold-ups that have occurred
here of late residents have become tim
id, and the actions of strange persons
and unusual noises after nightfall are
continually being reported to the po
lice. Last night the fashionable resi
dence district adjoining Grand street
was terrorized by the unaccountable
action of some unknown Individual,
who rang the doorbells of several dwell
ings and then ran from the premises.
Mrs. S. W. McCann of Grand street
and Alameda avenue caught a glimpse
of the miscreant as he was running
from her house. She describes him as
of slim build, about 25 years of age. He
wore a soft light felt hat and dark
clothes. The police are Inclined to think
that the doorbell ringer was the pal of
some housebreaker and that he sound
ed the doorbells to ascertain if there
was any one at home.

is really becoming epidemic and there
seems to be no check, for some of our
most talented girlsâyoung women
whom we had thought wedded to art
âhave succumbed to Cupid's plague.
A few days ago Miss Elsa Hunt, whose
aim for years has been an operatic
career, announces her engagement.
Wednesday another promising singer,
Carolyn Crew, became a bride, and
now that very talented young violinist,
Gertrude Hibbard, has "laid down the
fiddle and the bow" long enough to
tell us that she, too, has followed In
the footsteps of those who have al
ready proclaimed their happiness.
Miss Hibberd divulged her little se
cret this afternoon at an Informal tea
and r or once the news was a real sur
prise. The lucky man is Edw,ard Rus
sell Bliassen, a well known and very
popular young lawyer of this city.
Miss Hibberd is a daughter of Mrs.
H. E. Hibberd of Vernon Heights, and
though she has been a teacher for
several years in the Garfield School,
she has found time to develop a line
musical talent. Her violin playing
shows considerable temperament and
an excellent technique. Miss Hibberd
is a pupil of Henri Holmes.
At the tea to-day telegrams ad
dressed to each guest conveyed the
happy news.
Mr. EUassen, though a resident of
Oakland, has his oifice in San Fran

He is a member of the board of Free

when a clever newspaper man and
college graduate, Oscar R. Morgan,
was married to Miss Vida B. Priddy,
a young society girl of that little berg.
The groom was formerly editor of the
Haywards Review, but is now pub
lishing the Reno Gazette. He was
graduated with the class of '01 from
the University of California and has
many friends of the college town.
The bride is the daughter of Rev.
and Mrs. W. B. Priddy of Haywards,
and the wedding took place at her pa
rents' home. Her gown was a dainty
confection of cream jusi cloth over
taffeta and she carried the convention
al shower of Bride roses.
Miss Ruth Brown, in a pretty pale
green silk mulle and carrying white
carnations, was i maid of honor, and
Archie Cloud of Oakland attended the
groom. Myrtle Ewing, a niece of the
bride, was ring bearer, and the bride's
father pronounced the nuptial bless
ing.
Mr. and Mrs. Morgan left at once
for Reno, where they will reside.

APPLIES MATCH
TO COAL OIL
Firebug Tries to Destiby
Newly Finished Dwelling
of Contractor J. H. Young
OWNER FINDS EVIDENCE
Suspects Person Whose Acts
Have Been Looked Upon as
Being Noticeably Erratic
ALAMEDA, Jan. T.âWith coal oil,
shavings and broken laths an Incen
diary atetmpted last night to destroy a
new house on Railroad avenue, west of
Fifth street, owned by J. H. Young, a
local contractor. Owing to the damp
ness of the wood used to start the
blaze the flames smoldered out without
doing much damage to the structure.
Young discovered the results of the
firebug s work when he visited the
house to-day. In the room in which the
blaze was ignited a section of plaster
had been knocked from the wall, laths
removed and the combustible material
and kerosene ' placed between the
weather boarding and the lathing. Had
the flames obtained much headway It
would have been difficult to extinguish
them before considerable damage would
have been done.
Young informed the police that he
knew of no reason why any person
should endeavor to burn his property,
but affirms that his suspicions have
been directed toward an individual he
has observed in vicinity whare the
house is located and who is regarded aa
being erratic.
COCK FIGHTING ALWAYS
A POPULAR SPORT
From Early Time It Haa Furnished
Amusement to High
and Low.
Some that protest against the cruel
ty of cock-fighting have nothing to
say against the wanton slaughter of
pigeons in shooting matches. Game
cocks may be confiscated and put to
death; owners and spectators may be
fined; there will still be cocks ready
to fight and men longing to look on.
We are not detending the so-called
sport; we recognize tne facts. Cock
fighting has been an almost universal
amusement. Themistocles Is said to
have encouraged his soldiers by point
ing out to them the valor oÂ£ two
cocks, who fought, not for the house
hold gods, not tor tombs of ancestors.
but only because the one would not
give way to the other. Philosophers
have sat about the pit, and thereby
pointed -morals in academic grooves,
although a William Pulleyn never
heard ot but one imaginative person
who was a cock-fighter, "and such an
odd imagination is his, and so strange
are the ends which these cock-fight
ers come to, that he is now a morality
professor in a Scotch university."
Monarehs and roustabouts, grave and
elderly persona, as Roger Ascham, and
confirmed sports, all alike find pleas
ure In the pit. JJid not Beckman con
sider cock-fighting worthy of a chap
ter in his " History of Inventions?"
Football and the cockpit have been
favorite amusements of the English
for centuries, and there is hardly a
nation, civilized or barbarous, that has
not enjoyed tne sight of cock battling
with cock.âBoston Herald.
King James Not a Smoker.
Whether the use of tobacco as a
narcotic was known in the East be
fore the discovery of America is some
what doubtful. Probably the habit had
long been practiced in China, but it is
not certain. Its extended use, however,
certainly did not come about until the
early voyagers to America brought
back this custom of the Indians to the
Continent. Sir Walter Raleigh is sup
posed to have been one of the first to
introduce it into England, but it is not
known who was the "flrst man to
smoke a cigar " At the time of its in
troduction, about 1600, it was very ex
pensive, and confined to the wealthy.
It was smoked in very small pipes, and
the smoke expelled, not through the
mouth, but through the nose. TheVe
was much opposition to smoking from
religious and civil sources. Popes Ur
ban VIII and Innocent XI were strong
ly opposed to the practice, the Sultan
of Turkey declared it a crime, Sultan
Amiuret IV decreeing a punishment
by the crudest kind of death, and King
James of Scotland, at the end of the
sixteenth century issued a counter
blaste to tobacco," in which he de
scribed its use as "a custom loathsome
to the eye, hateful to the nose, harm
ful to the brain, dangerous to the lungs,
and in the black, stinking fumes there
of resembling the horrible Stygian
smoke of the pit that is bottomless."
Snuff is merely powdered tobacco.âW.

A Sagacious Dog.
Dr. A. C. Peck of Columbus, Ga., re
cently at the Imperial, tells a story of
a dog that he owns: .
"I have a fine black and tan collie,"
he says, "that for human intelligence
I will wager can't be beaten by any
other canine in the United States or
elsewhere. Let me give you an In
stance. In my consulting room the
dog frequently spends the morning, ap
parently asleep under a chair. He is
really taking an intelligent interest,
however, in all that is going on.
Recently he proved this to my com
plete satisfaction. One night after I
had gone to bed and had been asleep
for a couple of hours or' so I was
awakened by the dog whining outside
my bedroom door. I shouted 'He
down!' but he continued whining.
Thinking that there might possibly be
burglars in the house, I got up, lit
the gas and opened the door. The
dog wagged its tall, then put out its
tongue and help up Its paw to have
Its pulse felt. It had got distemper."

making his audience next Friday the
largest Ye Liberty Theater has ever
held.
Another benefit entertainment that
promises to be a brilliant social event
is the tea at Mrs. Maxwell Taft's next
Thursday. How h*Â»r little home will
hold everybody that has signified in
tentions of being present It la hard to
conceive, but love always finds a way.
and the love for her neighborâa wid
owed woman and her suddenly be
reaved little onesâthat has made Mrs.
Taft and her friends do this thing will
find a place for the scores of generous
visitors who have promised to help by
being among those present.

JOHN CHINAMAN KNOWS
HOW TO TAKE HIS BASE
Celestial Ia Very Dignified When Ha
Casta Off Cares of
Business.
With the summer weather the China
man cornea before ua prominent in hia
artistic silks and in his native naked
ness. His temperament also becomes
a noticeable feature to the observant
foreigner and the manner in which he
takes his pleasure contrasts marvel
ousiy with that of the energetic Occi
dental human being.
*In the early hours of the morning,
w hen the rays of Old, Sol are tempered
with the dissipating dews of night, the
wealthy native, as well as the worker
of low degree, may be seen carrying the
cage containing his favorite einr/ing
bird to the native gardens or other
tree-embowered spot and listening in
contemplative ecstacy to the Joyous
greeting which his caged friend pours
forth to the coming glory of the day.
As soon as the golden beams become
oppressive he retires to his domicile,
whether to labor or sleep 'tis hard to
tell. In any case, he is wise, for has he
not caught the beauty of the grandest
part of a summer's day, the majesty
of dawn? Again, when sunset's glow
has fallen dead in the west the China
man pours forth to his diversion. To
stand for hours with waving fan on
the curb of our city's thoroughfares
watching the procession of vehicular
and pedestrian traffic a Londoner can
obtain from a Lord Mayor's show,
daily repeated, while a volunteer pa
rade brings him forth in numbers pro
portionate to the metropolis' myriads
called out by a royal pageant.
Thus, in dignified, contemplative
manner does the Chinaman display his
idiosyncrasy of pleasure-taking. Again
the native of younger blood, Imbued
with a tinge of foreign taste, rushes
madly through the streets on the whir
ring wheel or drives, luxuriously re
clining in his smartly appointed car
riage, behind the fastest trotting pony,
steered by a reckless native Jehu,
which his means are able to procure.
The visitor to the various public re
sorts of the Chinese In the settlements
will invariably gain an interesting In
sight into the Chinaman and his pleas
ure-taking, and one striking feature
cannot pass unnoticed. Whether coolie,
merchant, office boy or mandarin, in
public the Chinaman at play ia inva
riably respectable. One hears much
of the native immorality, but decorum
when in the public eye and absoltely
moral behavior characterize even the
biggest rake among the Chinamen of
our settlements. Drunkenness is a vice
which Is usually kept within doora, as
are all other reprehensible practices.
Quarreling is almost an unknown
thing In public resorts- Never does
one witnesf anything approaching the
college student of Europe on the ram
page, or 'Arry and 'Arriet on a bank
'ollday tear. The Chinaman takes his
pleasure aa he takes his business, with
a calm, calculating philosophy, which
constitutes one of his greatest varia
tions from the habit of mind of the
vivacious European.âShanghai Times.
Laundry Hygiene.
It IU a natural query whether the
laundryman and his assistants are not
exposed to special danger of infection
from the constant handlmg of soiled
clothes of all descriptions. Ira S. Wile
is investigating the subject, and. al
though he has obtained nothing definite
in the shape of statistics, inquiry at a
number of laundering establishments
has put on record the opinions of laun
drymen themselves as to this danger.
They are in brief, that, although no
special precautions are taken, except
that particularly filthy materials are
not accepted and no clothes taken from
houses known to contain infectious dis
eases, the employes are no more sub
ject to infectious ailments than any
other class of indoor workers. As to
the healthfulness of the laundry atmos
phere, the moist air, the frequent
scrubbing of the rooms and the ab
sence of dust, all tend, they believe,
to the promotion of health.âNew York

ASTORIA, Or., Jan. 7.âBecause a ca
terer got his orders mixed the choir
boys of the Episcopal church were re
galed with frozen eggnog a night or
two since, while the guests of a rail
road man had a very quiet time with
ice cream. The choir boyÃ say they had
the time of their lives, while the other
people looked askance at their host.
The story ha 3 Just leaked out. Rev.

Episcopal church, Invited his choir to
a monthly entertainment. On the same
evening G. W. Roberts, local agent of
the Oregon Railroad and Navigation
Company, and Mrs. Roberts invited a
number of their friends to their res
idence. They gave an order for frozen
eggnog for refreshments. The rector
thought Ice cream would more than
satisfy the choir boys. But In the de
livery the two orders were mixed and
the deceitful eggnog got in its deadly
work. The caterer was missing imme

his angel-faced little singers seemed to
enjoy that entertainment far more than

LIQUID AIR PROMOTERS
AFTER CLARK'S NEPHEW
â â¢$
Accuse Senator's Relative of Trying
to Enrich Himself at Thelr
Ex^ense.
LOS ANGELES. Jan. 7.-H. C. Lee,
Senator Clark's new nephew-in-law in
this city, is accused by a group of
prominent local society men with be
ing a "frenzied financier." He has been
sued by Warren Carhart, Will Nevln
and Robert Flint, and has come back
from his honeymoon to find the sheriff
searching for a bank account commen
surate with his new dignity. So far
less than $10 has been found.
These young men formed the United
States Liquid Air Company and the
California Securities Company. The
idea of the latter concern the young
financiers got from the Northern Se
curities Company. They hired G. A.
Bobrick, and set him up an expensive
air factory, which so far has turned
â¢out hot air.
â¢ According to the petition Lee took
5000 shares of the stock to sell on a
recent trip East. They allege that he
met a friend named Winans in Western
New York and the two went to Florida.
Winans agreed to buy the 5000 shares
lor $50,000. He paid $13,350. it is alleged.
â¢ and then his enthusiasm suddenly fiz
zled out.
When he came home Lee reported
' his transactions. It is claimed by the
plaintiffs that he refused to restore the
missing shares or the money until
Winans should pay the balance. Lee
' declares that his associates are trying
to unduly force his hand.
MAY NOT GO TO SACRAMENTO.
Friends of Senator Bard Think That
He May Remain in Washington.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 7.âlt is now
problematical whether Senator Bard
will come to Sacramento or not. A
telegram reached his headquarters last
night to the effect that he would be
â¢here probably in the week, but this
evening his supporters made thfe fol-
lowing announcement: "The statement
published in some of the papers that
Senator Bard*was on the way out here
was unauthorized. It is true we had
hoped he had started and might ar
rive on Monday or Tuesday and so ex
pressed ourselves. He has now, in
r;ply to a further telegram from us,
wired as follows: 'I am anxious to do
everything possible to co-operate with
my supporters, but statehood affairs
interest the whole country, California
especially, and my responsibility in
leading the opposition forbids deser
tion when victory seems near.' "
Outside of this news there is nothing
to be heard regarding the Senatorial
situation. The legislators that re
mained here are anxiously awaiting the
return of those that went below in
rrdfrr to get the inside. They are all
expected in on to-morrow evening's
trains and a lively time is anticipated.

CITY CHARTER
TO BE AMENDED
Citizens of San Diego In
dorse Suggested Changes
in Laws of Municipality
BIG VOTE IS POLLED
One of the Measures Adopted
Provides for a Material
Reduction in the Council
SAN DIEGO, Jan. 7.âReturns from
thirteen out of twenty-one precincts
show that all of the twenty-seven
amendments to the city charter sub
mitted to the voters at the special elec
tion to-day were carried by a two
thirds majority. The result was a
landslide for the so-called reform ele
ment. The most important amend
ments carried were the three provid
ing for a reduction of the City Coun
cil, the election of the City Attorney
by popular vote and the initiative, ref
erendum and recall. The last amend
ment was carried by a smaller major
ity than any of the others, although
it had a big lead.
Under the new charter the Council
will consist of a Board of Aldermen
of nine members, isjstead of two board*
of twenty-seven members, as at pres
ent.
The amendments carried in every
precinct by a vote of 2 to 1 except in
two or three nrecincts, where a small
majority against the measures was re
turned. That the amendments aroused
much interest is evidenced by the fact
that thesYote cast was about 60 per cent
as heavy as that cast in the Presi
dential election last November.
Amendment No. Â£6 provides for the
recall of any public official on a petition
signed by 25 per cent of the qualified
electors voting at the last previous elec
tion. The referendum measure pro
vides that upon the petition of 15 per
cent of the qualified electors any pro
posed legislation shall be submitted to

RAILWAY POSTAL CLERKS
MUST "FIND" THEMSELVES
Court Holds That Government Does
Not Hare to Pay Board of Men
While Traveling.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 7. â Justice
Wrisht of the Court of Claims has
handed down a decision.in the case of
the railway postal clerks against the
United States, in which he holds that
the act of Congress making appropria
tions for the postal service does not
provide for the payment of board and
lodging of such clerks when absent
from their homes on duty.
The court decided that railway pos
tal clerks do not "travel under orders
of the Postmaster General," but that
they' travel by order of the statute cre
ating the office of a postal clerk; that
the statute granting traveling expenses
to "railway postal clerks while travel
ing away from their headquarters"
had no application in the case, as pos
tal clerks have no headquarters. The
court further held that the clerks had
expressly accepted the obligation to
pay their own expenses. This case af
fects nearly 12,000 railway postal
clerks.

BOSTON. Jan. 7.âThe heavy north
easterly storm which set In last night |
embraced all New England. The rain. '
accompanied by a rise of about 30 de- ;
grees in temperature, rapidly melted
the snow and caused much lnconven- j
ience. The gale, which reached a ye- j
locity of eighty miles an hour on the
coast, caused rough seas and high j

NEW YORK, Jan. 7.âThe heavy
rainfall of yesterday has swollen the
streams in Northern and Eastern New
Jersey. The Raritan River is nine- ,
teen feet above its normal level to
night. The ice has gone out and all
roads in its vicinity have been rendered
impassible. Great damage has been
done to bridges and' buildings along its
banks. Trouble is expected in the vicin
ity of Compton Lakes, where all rivers
and brooks are rapidly rising. The
Pequannock River is filled with float
ing ice which is forming gorges around
the railroad bridge. One bridge gave
way.
Much alarm is felt In Paterson at
the rise of the Passaic River. To-day
goods were removed from many of the
factories and stored along the river
front. The officials of Paterson are

PHILADELPHIA. Jan. 7.âThe ef
fect of last night's heavy rainfall,
which was driven by a thirty-six mile
gale, are in evidence to-day in all sec
tions of the city and environs. The
most serious result is the swollen con
dition of the Schuylkill River, which
is seventeen feet above normal at
Manayunk, a suburb. Fourteen mills
are closed as a result of the flood and
4 000 hands are idle. The water,
dammed up by the ice, backed up and
overflowed into the basements and
first floors of the factories and mills,
which line the banks of the river.
Coney Island was damaged to the
extent of $50,000 by the recent storm in
this section. Brighton race track was
overflowed, a large bulkhead protecting
Seaside Park was smashed and much
other damage was done to buildings
1 near the water.

CHICAGO. Jan. 7.âA1l the rail
roads centering in Chicago will make
application to Judge Kohlsaat of the
United States District Court on Jan
uary 17 for a permanent injunction

was granted in favor of most of the
roads, restraining the scalpers from
; dealing in the round trip tickets sold
I at reduced rates on account of the St.
i Louis Fair. Four or five of the roads
| terminating here did not ask for a
writ against the scalpers at that time,
; but it is said all will Join In the ap
j plication for a permanent order.

SEES A FUTURE
FOR DEMOCRACY
Southern Orator Declares
Party Is to Be Reborn, Re
formed and Reconstructed
DISASTER IS EDUCATION
Speaker at Jackson Day,
Banquet Says Failure Was j
Due to Hunger for Success!
â¢
CINCINNATI, Jan. 7.âJohn Temple
Graves of Atlanta, Ga., was the chief
orator at the Jackson day banquet of
the Duckworth Club to-night, speaking
on "Definite Democracy." In the course j
of his speech he said:
"In its nature and its mission the ,
Democratic party has been and must
be a reform party and a radical party, j
In the conditions which surround it!
now this mission and method become
the price of Its pouularity and the!
necessity of its life. We have always
failed and always will fail as a party j
of negation and a party of opposition.
Wa have failed because we have been
unfaithful. ' We have failed because we j
have trimmed and hesitated and atrad- j
died. We have failed" because we have
compromised with the apparently sue- i
cessful doctrines of the Republican"
party and surrendered to men whose I
interests and convictions were so near
ly akin to our political opponents that j
they ought in common honesty to
espouse the Republican party, to which
they belong. We have failed because
in our political hunger for success we
have imitated the platforms and pan
dered to the powers of the opposite
party, that held the government.
"Mr. President, the Democratic party
never had a clearer mission or a bright
er promise than to-day. Defeat is dis
cipline and disaster is education. Out
of the wreck of our fortunes we will,
build a noble and more endurlnsr use- j
fulness. The Democratic party Is co- ,
ing to be reborn, re-formed and recon-
Becrated to the constitution and to 1
popular rights and liberty."
In an interview here to-day Graves
said:
' The South is rapidly changing lta;
attitude toward President Roosevelt.
The people of that section as a whole
are no longer apprehensive concerning
his course toward them as the chief ex
ecutive of the land. They have learned
his.true worth, and are besrinnins: to
assume that degree of confidence in
him once reposed in the late lamented
William McKinley."
On the question of cutting down the
Southern representation in Coneress
Graves said:
"I do not believe it will ever be done.
The Southern people are for the most
part indifferent about the matter, al
though many would welcome it. But
It will not be done; Mr. Roosevelt is j
against it. as are many of the North- j
em people."
S. H. KENT IS BANQUETED
AT THE BUCKINGHAM HOTEL
S. H. Kent was the guest of honor
at a banquet given last night by mem
ben of the Builders' Exchange in cele- '
bratlon of his return from the East. |
The affair took place in the main din- i
ing hall of the new Buckingham Hotel, j
which was elaborately decorated for the
occasion. Long garlands of smilax were
suspended in great profusion about the
walls and twined round the electroliers.
The long banquet board was massed
with great clusters of hollyberries.
Following a delicious dinner, speeches,
songs and music added to the enjoy
ment and goodfellowship of the occa
sion.
James A. Wilson was toastmaster
and his introductory remarks as he
proposed the names of the different
speakers brought out rounds of ap
plause. Among the speakers were: W.
Cronan, R. McKillican, J. D. McGil
vray, Willis Polk, M. Kelleher and W.
J. Mathews.
The guest of the evening was very

SUSPECTED SAFE BLOWERS
ARE ARRESTED AT BENICIA
BENICIA, Jan. 7.âCharles Johnson,
colored, who halls from West Oakland,
and Jesse Smith, who says he resides
on Pine street in San Francisco, were
arrested here this evening on suspicion
of being the safe blowers who robbed
the Southern Pacific office at Dunnigan,
Yolo County. The railroad company's
office at Dunnigan and several stores
were broken into Friday night by
cracksmen, who blew open the safes
in the places visited and secured a
small amount of money.
The prisoners had nine sticks of
dynamite in their possession when over
hauled by Constable Hyde, and there
seems to be little doubt but that the
right men have been caught, as one of
them had a money bag stolen from a
store ransacked In Dunnigan. They
were also armed with knives and for
midable looking revolvers.

"SEASIDE"
Our picture* next Sunday is the work of P. Gabrini, one of
the most celebrated of modern Italian painters, and is a subject
which appeals, on account of its grandeur, to all mankindâthe
ocean. This picture shows us a rocky point jutting out into the
sea and rising from the end of a strip of beach, over which some
fishermen are pushing their boats into the surf, which is curling
over the sand in long rollers and breaking into white foamy spray
on the rocks.

LONE OUTLAW
ROBS MAIL CAR
Shoots Clerk Through the
Hand and Carries Off
the Registered Packages
MONTGOMERY, Ala., Jan. 7.âThe
mail car of the Atlantic Coast Line
train, which arrived in Montgomery
at 6 o'clock this evening, was robbed
about Aye miles east of the city. A
large amount of registered mail was
taken and the bandit escaped, drop
ping off the train as It entered the out
skirts of Montgomery. Eugene Hester,
the mall clerk, was shot through the
hand.
A stop was made at Wiley, six miles
from Montgomery, and Hester believes
the robber entered the car at that
point. Shortly after leaving there Hes
ter was ordered to hold up his hands
and, turning, he saw that he was cov
ered by a pistol in the hands of a
masked white man. Hester grabbed
at the pistol and the robber fired, the
ball going through the mail clerk's
hand. Hester then yielded and the
robber, keeping him covered, helped
himself to the registered packages.
When the train slowed up he jumped
from the car.
The value of the booty cannot be
given at this time, but it is believed to
be large.

Drinking Less Champagne.
And what do you say of champagne?
I see that the Rheims Chamber of
j Commerce has published figures which
I show that the number of bottles ex
ported in the year 1903-04 fell off by
nearly 1.600,000, while sales for home
consumption increased more than 500,
--000 bottles.
TheÃe figures are interesting. It Is
very certain that the consumption of
champagne has dropped very largely
here, not only in hotels, but ln pri-
Yes, I think there has
been a certain change of taste. Whisky
is displacing champagne even on spe
cial occasions. People are drinking less
sparkling wine. Champagne Is a very
extravagant wine, especially at hotels
and restaurants, where 12s to 15s a bot
tle is charged for the best brands,
which cost 7s or 8a Any quantity* of
good champagne is to be hadâ'9B, '99
and 1900 were all good wine years. But
,the object of shippers is to keep up the
price of champagne.âLondon Tele

â¢
Put a growing: plant under red glass
and It shoots up very tall and spindly.
Green glass causes a similar effect, but
not quite bo strongly marked. Blue
glass, on the other hand, seems to
dwarf vegetable growth.
A plant grown under blue glass is al
ways smaller than its neighbor under
transparent glass, although the condi
tions are otherwise similar.
A series of exoeriments in growing
plants under various colored glasses
was conducted by the well known as
tronomer Camille Flammarion, and the
results, as above, reported by him to
the French Academy.
Light and color are full of odd puz
zles, many of which are still a good
deal of a mystery. Dr. Nell Finsen,
famous for his electric light invention
for the cure of cancer, made exhaus
tive experiments on the effects of ani
mal life.
One or two of these were interesting.
For instance, he placed a number of
earthworms in a box covered half with
red, half with blue glass. In every case
the worms were found to crawl away
from under the blue glass and take
shelter under the red, where they re
mained quite content. Under blue light
they were invariably restless and ill at
ease.
THE CHAMELEON.
A chameleon lizard was then placed
by the experimenter in a small box, so
that half its body, was under blue and
the other half under red glass. He
noticed that at once the part under the
blue rays turned black, while that part
under red light remained almost white.
It wai evident that the creature was
using its pigment cells to protect it
self against the disagreeable effects of
the blue light.
It is now universally acknowledged
that the blue rays are, of all the vis
ible rays received from the sun, the
only ones that can produce injurious
effects upon animal or plant life. It is
these blue rays that cause scarring in
smallpox.
The skin in this disease becomes al
most as sensitive as a photographic
plate. If the patient is kept in the
dark no scarring results. But a red
light is equally harmless as darkness
and less unpleasant to the patient.
Sunstroke, as it is called, is pro
duced not by light rays at all, but by
the chemical rays of the sun. Sun
stroke may thus be termed a photo
graphic effect and therefore use color
to fight it.
Treat the body as a photographer
treats his dark plates. Envelop it not
in black, as usually done, but in
orange. An orange-colored shirt and
a coat lined with orange fabric have
actually been tried by officers in In
dia who, had to march during hot
weather. Men so attired were cer
tainly rendered immune to sunstroke.
Certain blind persons can tell the
color of a flower by laying it against
their cheek. Actual experiment shows
that blossoms of certain colors are in
reality warmer than those of other
tints.
A scientist who recently carried out
a series of such experiments found
that dark reds and browns gave the
sensation of greater warmth, while
lemon yellow was the coldest color.
Pink is warmer than white, but white
âcuriously enoghâis warmer than
violet, blue or yellow.
A rather odd fact about yellow is
that a yellow light has greater power
of penetration in foggy weather than
a pur" white one. It has been proved
that ihe yellowish light of oil or gas
Ifi a lighthouse lantern can be seen
farther out at sea than can the pure
white of an electric lamp.
In clear weather and by daylight
green is visible at the greatest distance
of any color, much fareher, for in
stance, than scarlet, which is usually
imagined to be the most brilliant of
colors. Indeed, blue, end even dark
gray, are far more visible at a distance
than is scarlet.
About a year ago the experiment was
tried at Aldershot of blotching a field
piece all over with splashes of different
color. It was found that at a short
distance it was quite indistinguishable
from the hillside upon which it stood.
WARSHIPS ARE GRAY.
That gray light is a most useful color
for purposes of concealment is proved
by the fact that warships are now
painted that color.
There are only three colors that can
not be resolved into any simpler colors.
These are red, green and violet. It
seems odd, then, that the primary col
ors are usually given as red, green and
yellow.
The fact is, however, that from the
latter all other known colors can be
compounded.
Dr. Baraduc produced photographic
pictures of the emotions, taken by
means of an instrument termed the
magnetometer. Anger is shown as
rays diverging from a center. Jealousy
as a cloud, love as a feathery shape.
More recently another investigator
has declared that all the emotions have
their respective colors and that these
are visible to persons under psychic in
fluence. *sA.nger flashes are of deep and
lurid red, love is rose-pink, jealousy
green, while devotional thought Is ex
hibited in clouds of deep blue.âWash

Sewing Machines for Esquimaux.
A band of eleven Esquimaux from
the Aleutian Islands passed through
Seattle on their way home from the St.
Louis Exposition, attired in the gar
ments of civilization, and two of the
squaws are taking back sewing ma
chines, which will be installed in their
ice huts to supplant the bone needle
and gut thread with which they have
been wont to sew their garments.
On the down trip the party could not
appreciate a bed, and all slept on the
floor. Now they take to the beds as
naturally as they do to seal oil on their
native heath, and, strange as it may
seem, none of is homesick and all
are anxious to return to this country
next year.
One of the articles that are being
taken back by the head of the party is
a stovepipe hat. He saw President.
Roosevelt wearing a high silk hat at
the fair, and when told it was the
President who wore it at once commis
sioned Mr. Bales to go out and buy him
one. As becomes the dignity of the
chieftainship, he will only wear the
hat on state occasions.

FEAR TO ROB
A. B. A. BANKS
Burglars and Forgers Not to
Attack Banks That Belong
To American Association
â¢
OFTEN RETURN PLUNDER
Association Never Gives Up
the Hunt for Those Who
Offend One of Its Members
At the convention of the American
Bankers' Association ln the Waldorf-
Astoria the protective committee made
a report of the hold-ups, burglaries,
forgeries and other crimes to which the
banks of the country had been sub
jected during the year ending Septem
ber 1.
The association, or A. B. A., as it Is
called, spends an immense sum yearly
to protect the money vaults of its
members from the depredations of
crwoks. It never lets up on a criminal.
It will spend $10,000 to run down a thief
who steals only $10. It has proceedetl
on the principle that if it can con
vince the professional bank crooks
that, sooner or later, they will be pun
ished for any 'thefts, the funds of its
members will be practically safe.
The Pinkerton detective agency is
employed by the year to run down
bank thieves of all kinds. The con
tract of the A. B. A. with the Pinker
tons puts it squarely up to the detec
tives not only to arrest every offender,
but to keep sleuths constantly in touch
with professional thieves, so that they
will be able to warn a bank that has
been selected as a good one to plunder.
AVOID A. B. A. BANKS.
The report made by the Pinkertons
of their work in the last year shows
that the A. B. A. banks suffered com
paratively little, while the non-mem
ber banks bore the brunt of tjie losses
through crooks. That the determina
tion of the A. B. A. to run down any
thief who attacks one of its banks is
bearing fruit is shown in two instances
where crooks returned plunder when
they found that the banks they had
robbed belonged to the A. B. A.
Referring to the forger, the report
says:
"'the professional forger has during
the last year been unusually active,
but we have caused the arrest of thir
ty-five forgers, convicted twenty, who
were sentenced to fifty-three years and
seven months, in addition to which six
w ere sentenced to indeterminate terms
in prison; one escaped, one sentence
suspended, %vhile ten are awaiting trial
and five were released."
What happened to crooks who preyed
upon banks during the year is shown
in the following summary:
FORGERS AND SWINDLERS.

Average specific sentences, 5 years 6 months.
During the year 111 banks were at
tacked by burglars. Of these only
twenty-four were members of the
A. B. A.
The total losses of the A. B. A. banks
were $10,857 61. while the non-member
banks lost $75,607 11. Of the sum stolen
from the A. B. A. banks $1816 17 was
recovered.
Thirty robberies which had been
planned against A. B. A. were thwart
ed, the detectives learning in advance
of the schemes.
Nearly all of the bank burglaries
were made by "yeggmen" or half crook
and half hobo, according to the report,
which says:
"Although during the year your mem
bership has been increased by over 600
banks, many of them in small towns,
the successful burglary of members
has been less and the amount obtained
by them more than $28,000 less than
last year. Of the amount stolen, $1,
--816 17 was recovered.
LAID TO THE "YEGGMEN."
"We attribute many of the attacks
to recent additions to the 'yegg* burg
lars, whose ranks are continually aug
mented from the large floating popula
tion of 'hoboes.' From 1898 the opera
tions of the 'yegg' burglar on banks
have gradually increased."
In former years banks suffered great
ly from sneak thieves, but last year the
number of these crimes was very small.
They have decreased since the A. B. A.
adopted its protective system. Refer
ring to sneak thieves the Pinkerton re
ports says:
"That they fear your association has
been illustrated by the prompt sending
back of stolen property. This year
there were two notable cases where the
stolen property was promptly returned.
"Securities valued at $6000, stolen
from a Baltimore, Md., member were
found by the president of the bank as
the result of an anonymous telephone
message.
"ln the other case a tin box, contain
ing bonds about to be issued, of the
face value of $50,000, was stolen by
sneak thieves from the vault of the
bank and was returned from Milwau
kee by express, with a note."
This note, referring to the A. B. A
membershio sign, read:
"Please put your sign where your
customers can see it, and save them
trouble."
There were three daylight "hold-ups"
of banks' during the year, two of the
institutions robbed being non-members
i f the association.
The report says the Pinkertons be
lieve that Harvey Logan, the famous
bank and train robber, who escaped
from the Knoxville.(Tenn.) jail on June
27 of last year, is dead, having been
killed in an unsuccessful nold-up of a
Denver and Rio Grande train near
Parachute, Colo., on June 6 last.
The body of the bandit was photo
graphed by the Pinkertons and the por
trait shown to a number of men who
knew Logan. Several of them partly
identified It. The A. B. A. had been
hunting Logan ever since the summer
of 1897, when he robbed the Butte
County bank of Montana.âNew York

WELL-GUARDED
INSTITUTION
A Company of Guards Brig
ade Mounts Duty Every
Night in Bank of England
WELL W T ATCHED IN DAY
Two Unseen Policemen Note
All Who Enter or Leave,
Ready to Act on Occasion
It Is commonly known that a com
pany of the Brigade of Guards mounts
duty within the Bank of England every
night- The men, with a diminutive bÂ»u r
gler at their head and commanded by
an officer, may be seen marching from
Wellington Barracks, along the Thames
embankment, into the city every even
ing, not even Sunday or the merry
night of Christmas being allowed to
break the rule.
But it is hardly known at all how the
bank is watched and guarded through
out the day. Thousands swarm past
its portals every weekday hour, never
suspecting the presence of two men
who are invisible, yet who are so close
to the traffic of the street that they
might also arrest the passing'pedes
trian with outstretched hand.
ALWAYS ON WATCH.
These two men are detective officers
of the city police, and from 9 o'clock in
the morning till the bank closes they
never leave their postâat least, not to
gether. If one has occasion to be ab
sent for a moment the other always re
mains, but, generally speaking, they
face each other the whole day long.
Why are they there? The explana
tion is that there is never any knowl
edge where they may be wanted. There
is a species of gentry to whom the
Bank of England is always prime game.
Bank notes, again, for various goad
reasons, are always being stopped, and
there is never a moment when a stop
ped note may not be presented by a
shady character. When'this happens
one of the alert watchers appears In
the noteroom as if by magic.
SEE ALL VISITORS.
As has been already said, they are
rarely seen until they are wanted. In
the wall which divides the main en
trance into two portals is constructed
a sitting box of woodwork and glass,
and here, facing each other, in con
stant readiness, the two officers sit
throughout the day.
The one with his back toward
Thread-needle street can observe every
person who leaves the bank, whether
on his right hand or on his left; the
other with his face toward the street
can similarly see every person who en
ters through the gates. But neither in
comer nor outgoer can see the two
watchers until he comes almost abreast
of the box.
ROGUES WHO ARE FEARED.
It is when the clock of the Royal Ex
change strikes 3 p. m., the heralding
the last hour of business, that the of
ficers are most alert, especially of the
last half hour, that anything may hap
pen.
One rogue may hope to pass a
stopped note, a second may attempt to
pass a forgery, a third may be look
ing for an opportunity to whip off
somebody's cash bag and a fourth may
try to loaf unobserved until the doors
are closed in the hope of a chance to
make a haul.
For these reasons one of the officers
always remains within the bank pre
cincts until 6 o'clock, his colleague be
ing free to leave at 4. The governor
and court of the bank pay, of course,
for the two hours' additional service
and there is every justification for the
extended precaution. When the detec
tive officer has closed his duty the mili
tary guard marches in for the night.â

REGULAR ALLOWANCE
FOR THE CHELDREW
Give Certain Stipend, However Small*
and Teach the Right Use
Thereof.
The father may be of great assist
ance to his boy when he is old enough
to have an allowance of spending
money. A boy's first idea of th 3 use of
money is to buy everything which at
tracts his fancy. When an allowance
is made him he should be advised as to
its proper expenditure, but if he. is to
learn to spend wisely he must be per
mitted to use his own judgment When
he has made a few mistakes and finds
himself out' of money before the day on
which he receives it he will learn to
spend more carefully the next time,
A father sometimes prefers the plan
of giving money to the boy as he may
feel disposed; sometimes the amount
may be very liberal, at other times
very meager, and at others none at all.
The method has nothing to recommend
it, and cannot possibly teach the boy
the proper use of money. If he has
only to beg his father long enough to
produce any desired amount there will
be no reason for his exercising any
care in spending it. Although the
amount he receives simply depends
upon the generosity of his father, he
will in time come to demand it as a
right, and he will spend it as his fancg
may dictate. From this method he will
never cultivate economy nor learn to
save large amcrbnts by small sacrifices
and the saving of small amounts.
If an allowance is promised a child It
should be paid as punctually as to a
business man. Otherwise he will im
bibe ideas of laxity in money attairs
which will hurt his business career.
Allow the boy to decide whether the al
lowance is to be paid to him in money
or credited to his acccount in a book
which he may keep for the purpose.
It will probably be more satisfactory
to both parties for the money to bo
paid each week, and the boy may
learn to save it by opening an account
at a savings bank. Ths amount of the
allowance may be exceedingly small,
but it will be sufficient to give him a
feeling of Independence.
The accumulation of money and the
necessary discipline are great factors,
and the father who teaches his son to
expend it wisely has prepared him for
many of the serious problems of life.
As husband and father, the man of the
house has the power to make a home
very happy or miserable. He is looked
up to with reverential love unless he
himself destroys that sentiment, and
he is the greatest man In the World to
his son until he lowers the standard set
for him.
Coldest Place in the World.
Werchejansk, Siberia, is considered
the northern pole of cold, or place of
greatest cold in the northern hemi
sphere. A temperature of 69.8 degrees
centigrade below zero (the freezing
point of water) has been observed
there, but the Russian painter, Boris
sew, has found a temperature of 70 de
grees centigrade below zero registered
on a minimum thermometer left by an
Austrian exploring expedition in 1872 in
the Straits of Matotchkin, Nova Zem
bla. Another maximum thermometer
registered 14 degrees above zero centi
grade as the highest temperature since
1872. Apparently the place has a good
title to be regarded as the polo of cold.
