CONRIED'S GRAND OPERA STARS ARE WELCOMED BY
A GREAT AUDIENCE OF FASHIONABLE FOLK
RIED'S Metropolitan Grand Opera Company began its long-anticipated engagement last night at the Grand Opera-house, and the large theater was filled with an immense audience that greeted the great singers
/ enthusiastically. "Rigolctto," which zvas chosen for the- opening bill was heartily received. Society zuas out in force, and the foyer of the theater and Mission street were lined with crmvds that encaited patiently the arriial
and departure of the handsomely gowned ivomen.
SUPERB PICTURE
THE INITIAL NIGHT
OF GRAND OPERA
White Shoulders and Blazing
Jewels Flash From Pit,
Art and Atmosphere Make Up
the Whole Great Story.
SALLY SHARP
The opera â that Is. grand opera is
60 per cent art and 50 per cent atmos- \
fhere.
Heretical ? Perhaps. But isn't It
true.
With ail due deference to the sublime j
art flung upon the air last night would \
it have been the splendid thingâ the
thing that drugged the senses were it ;
not for the ma7.es of gleaming shoul- !
ders, the blazing jewels, the smart 1
frocks, the men big and brave, the pul- |
sating wave of expectancy and of thrill, !
lhat mystifying thing that we call, for |
uant of a better name, atmosphere? j
But why quibbJe. about so trifling a i
thins when we were blessed with both, !
Â»r falleth the manna from heaven.
For once in many moons San Fran- i
cisco behaved itself wondrously, being ;
in its seats at a most gracious hourâ ]
In due deference to the request of the
management and here's a tip to local
rra.nÂ£gers, now that Mr. Conried has
â¢ '-.sciplined us so splendidly).
Ah: That was a picture not soon
forgot â that house of the cavernous pit,
rising tier upon tier, gallery after gal
lery, splashed with colors faint as the
hues of a summer rainbow; and as
the dewdrops glitter in the morning,
so came the gleam and glitter from
women's throats. And not all the hon
ors fell to the women either the men
looked mighty nice, should any one
happen to ask you.
For some reason we women often find
ourselves comparing our Western men
folk with the men of New Yorkâ
if the truth be told, and it should be,
even in newspapers, our own dear men
are sometimes found a little shy in the
matter of externals, small matters to
be sure. But last night, wellâ they
were superb, and here's to them.
As to the details of this famous
house let me say that It was a pale au
dience â pink, white and blue, with
white nolding the palm for supremacy.
Decollete? Tea, quite. And some
more so!
But as the altitude rose, so did the
corsage, save In the proscenium boxes,
where altitude didn't seem to count.
Another feature that was marked by
altitude was the show of enthusiasm.
But, of course, 'tis indisputably bour
seolse to manifest deep emotion â a pre
rogative left to the lowly. So It was
not amazing that the loudest plaudits
came not from the patricians' part of
the house, but from the plebs? And
the truth to tell, methinks the plebs
en joyed the opera because in ex
pressing their joy they thrilled to It.
Besides they knew their soore, these
people whose eyes gleamed with joy and
whose breath came not while Caruso
scaled a pinnacle of melodyâ these are
the people who get the most out of
grand opera, and their full moneys
worth. Looking over that house last
night the thought came to me that here
was indubitable proof of the com
mercial prosperity of our City by the
Golden Gate. Has the California Pro
motion Committee noted it? Another |
gratuitous tip. But Isn't It true?
Think of the cash value of the gowns
and jewels gathered beneath that dome
last night! Why, the jewels would ran
som a dozen Pericardis.
Tush! Tush! They couldn't have
been Kimberliesâ perish the thought!
At least , 'tis a pleasant illusion and let
us never willfully, destroy an illusionâ
ljt-e holds so few.
Some one in the foyerâ foy-a. if you
rh-ascâ -asked me if the house wasn't
splendid when the lights were ''flashed
upon it; which made irie think .how j
much more interesting it was in the
film,' uncertain shadow when the cur
tain was up. Here was a living; breath
ing picture of the things Whistler loved
to paint. It was in truth a Whistler
picture, with its â¢; subtlety," itÂ£ susrgts
tion, its gray vagueness, with a gleam
fUchine from out the shadows, 'here
The San Francisco Call.
and there, as women leaned forth to
drink the draughts of the melody.
That gleam from out of the shadows
gave the Whistler touch.
This was atmosphereâ 6o per cent of
the grand opera.

LOUNGERS IN THE LOBBIES INTERCHANGE
VIEWS CONCERNING STARS ON STAGE
SCENE AT ENTRANCE TO THE GRAND OPERA-HOUSE LAST NIGHT WHEN THE CONRIED COMPANY BEGAN ITS SEASON
Caruso Provokes Premature Disparagement From
One Critic and Semfirich Is Warmlu Discussed.
Femininity was conspicuously and
disappointingly shy in the entr'acte
flocking to the lobbies. Expansive and
immaculate shirtbosoms outglittered
bared shoulders In a ratio that dulled
the picture, and the rustle of satins
was Inaudible amid the squeak of pa
tent leathers. For a first night, how
ever, the beauty parade was strong
enough to Inspire old opera-goers with
hope for better things ere the season
closes. These veterans recalled the
opening of the first Grau series, about
five years ago, when hardly a woman
left her chair from beginning to end
of the performance, yet a week had
rot lapsed when the fair ones were
beating the opposite sex at every point
of its own lounging game with the ex
ception of those Involving th 6 con
sumption of tobacco or ardent liquids.
Another thing was noticeable In the
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
lobbyâ the ease with which almost
â¢very man wore his opera raiment
Harking back to that first Grau season
one cannot forget the sartorial incon
gruities that promenaded the tiles.
Spiketaila surmounted by wideawakes,
and Tuxedos topped by collapsible
stovepipes were no uncommon sight,
and tradition has It that one gentle
man wore tan shoes with his broed
cloth and dazzled all beholders with
the brilliance of a first-water stone
nestling in a pink shirtfront. No such
agonizing spectacles enlivened the
waits last evening. In no instance was
the fashion-plate dictum violated, and
if any gentleman felt uncomfortable in
his attire he artfully dissembled the
feeling.
To find out who crowded the lobbies
just take the Blue Book and read the
names of all the gentlemen mentioned
therein who were not out of town last
night. The scene was good to gaze
upon and still better to be a portion
of, for by loitering in the lobbies one
could overhear opinion 6O varied as to
create wonder how such a thing as a
common standard of criticism ?ould
ever be established and maintained.
Caruso was the most talked-about ar
tist, because Sembrlch and the other
principal singers had been heard and
commented on by those same people in
that same lobby years ago, and in al
most every instance the new tenor was
treated comparatively.
"What do you think of that Caruso
chap?" a fat man cautiously asked an
acquaintance, whose habitual first
night attendance at the Tlvoll has
earned him repute as a music sharp.
"I think little Rueso has him skinned
a mile in that same role," was the an
swer. And the fat man prudently re

KING EDWARD
CONFERS WITH
FRENCH CHIEF
Their Display of Cordiality
a Comsplcooitiis Response
to the Kaiser.
Paris Government Will Not
Recede From Its Moroc
can Programme.
PARIS, April 6.â The arrival of King J
Edward in Paris to-day vras the occa
sion for a notable manifestation of An- ;
glo-French cordiality, which Is being
generally Interpreted to-night as a con
spicuous responso to Germany's atti
tude regarding Morocco, although the
King remained but a short time. He
Tiaa met outside the city by President
LÂ»oubet, who held a private conversa
tion with him lasting nearly an hour.
The details of the conversation excites
a wide range of speculation, but its
actual purport has not been disclosed.
However, a semi-offlcial communica
tion recites that the meeting had far
less, reserve than that between Ki^g
Edward and President Loubet last year
and that it was marked by the freedom
of the confidences exchanged.
Beyond this private conversation |
King Edward confined himself to the :
usual public expressions of good will.
He spoke at the station of the pleasure '
& visit to France always gave him, but |
there was not the slightest public utter
ance having significance upon pending
political affairs. In this respect the
Klng'6 reserve Is being compared with
the freedom of Emperor William's re
cent utterances.
NO SiILJTARY DISPLAY.
The passage of the King was unat
tended by any spectacular features, as
It was the wish of the authorities to
avoid a political demonstration. Presi
dent LÂ»oubet joir/ed the royal train at
Pierrefitte 6tatlon, where, surrounded
by distinguished officials, of both gov
ernments, the two rulers exchanged
their first greetings. The King con
ducted President Loubet to his private
car, where the conversation continued
until the Lyons railway station was
reached. Outside the station the crowd j
was held back by cordons of police, the
absence of military display being no- j
ticeable. During the half-hour at the
6tatlon King Edward continued to talk ;
with President Loubet and held an ex- i
tended conference with the British Em- \
bassador to Paris, Sir Francis Levison
Bertie.
King Edward left Paris at 7:10 o'clock
f r r Marseilles to Join Queen Alexandra
on board the royal yacht.
The eemi -official communication rel
ative to the meeting of King Edward
and President Loubet says:
- "It is natural to suppose the conver
sation between the King and the Pres
ident led to an exchange of views upon j
all diplomatic questions of the day; \
but as neither has divulged the conn- ]
dences. it is necessary to receive with
reserve the more or less ingenious ver- !
sions which will be placed in circula- ,
tion. Judping, however, from exter
nal appearances, one cannot but re
mark that the meeting to-day was
marked not only by less reserve !
than that of last year, but notably by
the greater freedom of the confidences
exchanged."
NAVIES MAY THREATEN.
Despite this official reserve, the pub
lic and press herald the meeting as
most significant. The Journal desDe
bats says:
"It is a new affirmation of the Anglo-
French entente, which will be fol
followed by naval demonstrations by
a British and French squadron."
This, says the Debats, is the response
to the attitude Germany has taken to
ward France, and the paper adds:
"It will be imprudent if the states
men at Berlin fail to observe this par
ticularly conspicuous reafnrmation of
the Anglo-French entente."

the vieit appears to be to strengthen
the determination to proceed with

ance with the terms of the Anglo-

strued as a timely expression from the
signatories of that agreement.
KING GREETS EMPEROR.
Victor Emmanuel and William Meet
ou the Latter's Yacht.
NAPLES, April 6. â King Victor Em
manuel arrived here to-day from
Rome, accompanied by Foreign Min
ister Tiitoni and Naval Minister Mira
bello to meet Emperor Wiliium. An
Italian squadron was anchored around
the imperial yacht Hohenzollern and
the docks, steamers and small craft
were crowded with thousands of spec
tators. Tiie royal launch approached
the Hohenzollern amidst the booming
of cannon and with the Italian sailors
cheering the Germans, and the Ger
mans responding with cheers for the
Italians.
Emperor William received the royal
visitor at the gangway and their majes
ties embraced and kissed each oth^r
in the most corlial manner. The Em
peror then shook hands with ttie Ital
ian Ministers, whom he already knew,
after which the sovereigns presented
to each other the members of their
respective suites. The entire party
took luncheon on board the Hohen
zollern.
Several interesting anecdotes are al
ready circulating here in connection
with Emperor William's visit to Na
ples. The most characteristic is that
regarding Captain KaempfT of the
steamship Deutschland, at present in
command of the steamship Hamburg,
on which the Emperor came to Nar
ples. His Majesty knew that Captain
Kaempff had recently met President
Roosevelt and had in his cabin on the
Deutschland the President's auto
graph photograph. When the Emper
or left the Hamburg he gave Captain
Kaempff as a parting gift his auto
graph photograph in a gold frame,
saying:
"When you receive your pretty
American lady friends in the cabin of
the Deutschland I want to be there,
too."
FRANCE WILL XOT YIKLD.
Republic- Is Peterminrd to Continue
Its Policy in Morocco.
LONDON. April 6.â The British Gov
ernment has not received from Count
Wolff-MÂ« tternich, the German Embas-
Fador, or any other source, a memo
randum regarding Morocco similar to
that handed to Secretary Taft by
Baron Ppeck yon Sternburg, the Ger
man Embassadc-r to the United States,
relay. Germany's action in sing
ling out the United States for an of
ficial notification of her attitude toward
Morocco has created some feeling in
official circles, where no attempt is
mp.de to conceal the leaning of Great
Britain toward France in the Moroccan
controversy.
A well-informed official of the Brit
ish Government said to-day that
France would continue her policy in
Morocco, and it is firmly believed that
the next step on the part of France
ie llkfly to develop a climax and bring
the situation to a head.
Not much attention is paid here to
the suggestions from some quarters of
the Continent that the King's visit to
France may be preliminary to an An
glo-French alliance. Neverthedess,
following as it does on an active ex
change of views between London and
Paris, it is expected to help in smooth-
Ing away some of the international
controveries. Although King Edward's
trip to the Mediterranean was arranged
some time ago, no steps were taken to
arrange a meeting with LoubK until
after Emperor William's visit to Tan
gier.
FRANCE FAVORS "OPEN DOOR."
Ambassador Says This Has Always

WASHINGTON, April 6.â French
Embasaador Jusserand called on Sec
retary Taft to-day to make Inquiries
relative to the visit of the German
Embasador yesterday and the repre
sentation the latter made relative to
Morocco. HÂ« was informed that Bar

DENIES STATEMENTS
MADE BY DR. GLADDEN
Says the Standard Company
Owns No Railroads and
Denounces Assertions to
the Contrary as "Vile"
NEW YORK, April 6.â C. T. !
Dodd, chief solicitor of the Standard
Oil Company, gave out a statement to- |
day with reference to the recent dis- !
cussion as to the acceptance of a gift j.
of $100,000 offered by John D. Rock
efeller for missionary work. Dodd
declares that the statement that Rock- J
efeller made his money dishonestly j
"is false, is vile, and, being- made by
ministers in the pretended interest of i
morality, is doubly vile." i
Dodd says that the Standard Oil j
doe 3 not own a share of stock in any i
railroad company and does not con- .
trol any railroad company, and that,
since the enactment of the interstate
commerce law. it has not received :
lower rates than other shippers by re- j
bates,: arrangements, devices or plans j
of any character. The testimony of j
Howard Page, freight agent of the
Standard Oil Company, before the in- j
dustrial commission is quoted in this j
connection. â¢ .With reference to gas j
and copper companies Dodd says:
No doubt many have been prejudired against
Mr. Rockefeller by sensational writers,, whose j
articles, accompanied by portraits and carl- j
catures. are Intended to create the Impression j
that Mr. Rockefeller : was prlnctpal In the af- !
fairs relating to the organization of th â  gas ]
ajid copper companies, although no facts show
ing such connection Is stated. The Standard
Oil Company has already dented that It tMUI
any connection or interest, directly or ir,- '
directiy. in the organization of these â¢â cor- â¢
porations. and on the best authority the same '.
denial Is now made for John D. Rockefeller.
He had no connection with, . nor Interest in, j
directly or indirectly, the organization of theae j
corporations. j
ASSAILS THE CLERGY.
Dodd's statement continues:
There may well be a difference of opinion
on the abstract cueqtioo whether the board
of missions should receive gittm unless satis
fied that the giver ie honest but all will
fiwic- that if he who brings his gift to the
altar must come with clean hands still more
shou.d he who ministers at the altar and re
ceives the gift be tree from stain. There is
no excuse for thote who make money dis
honestly and still less excuse for those who,
in the name of religion falsely accuse thalr
fellow men.
The objection to Mr. Rockefeller's gift ie
based upon the allegation that he made his
nioney dishonestly. This accusation Is fa.se,
i? vile. and. being made by ministers in the
pretended interest of morality, is doubly falae.
The assertion should not be made unless it
can be readily established by specification and
proof. 1 have seen no proof and no attempt
even at specification, except iri the protest of
Dr. Gladden. He says:
"In this case the Investigation has been
thoroughly made and the facts are knowji.
The legislative inquiries, the record* of thÂ«
courts have given the reading people of thiÂ«
country the materials for a judgment upon
t|M methods of Standard Oil, and never wae
a day whan their minds were as clear on
thie subject as they are now."
Then tollows the specifications:
"Mr. Rockefeller may deny that rebates are
now given to the Standard, but the Standard
now controls about two-thirds of the railroads
et this country and its power is exerted in
establishing classification of freights In such
a way that it can kill competition. Rebates
are no longer necessary."
CONTROLS \O RAILROADS.
The assertion is not true. No such state of
facts has ever been disclosed by any. investi
gation, nor nupported by evidence in anj* court
of law. No such facts exist to be proved. The
Standard Oil Company does not own a share of
Ktock In any railroad company, nor does It ton
trol any railroad company. Stockholders of the
Standard unioubtedly invest in I railroad as In
other shares, but stockholders of the Standard
Company ar^ not a majority on the board of
directors of any railrcad, so far as I am
aware, and, therefore, cannot control.
The question of railway rebates and Standard
control of railways was ; investigated by . the
i:nited States Industrial Commission In 1000,
and they reported no such facta. Members of
the Standard and the railways were questioned
in relation to these subjects. It was shown
that prior to UiÂ« enactment of the interstate
commerce law the rebate system was universal.
Railroads made their nominal rates higher
than they expected to obtain from regular ship
pers, and the amount of actual freight to be
paid was a matter of contract. . Each shipper
made the beet terms he could. The Standard
did not Invent this system, Dtt it found it ex
isting and could not do business without sub
n.itting to it. Like all ether shippers. it made
the bept, terms it was able to make with the
railroads. Its refineries were located at points
where It could take advantage of every compe
tition. It also strove to " give ' equivalents â  for
reductions In freight. It shipped not only car
loads, but tralnlcads. It provided terminal and
other facilities and assumt-d air risks of losw. â 
Public opinion. m< r i nlightoned in these days
than in those, may have discovered that it was
all wrong, but at that time the business man
who aid not accept that method would better
have Closed his shep
REBATES CHEAPEN PRICES.
The stories told of the immense aggregate
of the rebates paid to the Standard were
shown by that investigation to be untrue. A
large portion of the rebates paid were not dis
criminatory- They were paid to all shippers
who shipped exclusively by rail. Jt was im
possible for any shipper to know with certainty
what rates his competitors were paying.
The Standard often found that its competi
tors had been paying less rates than it paid.
Furthermore, the public obtained the advan
tage of the low rates received. A reduced
price for refined oil kept pace with the reduc
tion in rates, whether this reduction was by
way of rebates or otherwise. And the price
at which the public foi many years ha 3 been
obtaining oil would simply have been impossi
ble had not shippers forced the railways to
reduce the rates, which they did, first by re
bates and later by open schedule.
The system of rebates has happily received
the condemnation of law. The Standard wel
comed the change as a beneficial one. But to
say now that it should not have obtained tha
best rates under the old situation which ita
position enabled it to obtain Is an Impossible
counsel of perfection.
The evidence before^ the â¢Industrial . Commis
sion shows very clearly -to. any -unprejudiced
mind that since the enactment of the interstate
commerce law the Standard has obeyed 'it - in,
every , particular. / The ' evidence : of .the , Stand
ard managers and 1 freight agents was | corrob
orated by ; the certificates 'of - managers â 'â¢; and
freight â â  agents "of all the'- leading' railway* â ;' of
the United : States ;to the effect < that by no re
bates, arrangements, ;â¢ devices or v plans :- of ; any
character had the Standard received less rates
than other. shippers. ' .:â  ' ''.â '.:;<â¢. :â -.
It '- Is : true that â¢ allegations to v the contrary
were made before I the ; commission, | but " these
were founded. upon surmise and were ', not sus

Gladden, who had raised the ques
tion of rebates, was well able, he said,
to answer the company on that mat
ter.
-We did not originate these
charges." said Mr. Evans, "We say
that Mr. Rockefeller and the Stand
ard Oil Company are charged with
various indictments and are not yel
cleared, and, not being cleared ol
them, we do not feel that we have the
moral right to stand in relations ol
honor with them. The printed storj
of the Standard Oil Company gives
specification after specification as tc
what the company has done, not iml>
in the matter of rebates, but in levy
ing tributes upon other conc2rns, ir
crushing out competition, in establish
ing a system of espionage to find oui
the private business of other concerns
etc. These documents are either posi
tive proof of the iniquitous methods ol
the Standard Oil Company or magnifi
cent opportunities for a juit of libe
against the publisher.
"It will take very much more thar
a general denial on the part of a law
yer to answer the accumulated evi
dence."
REJECT CARNEGIE'S GIFT.
Voters of a Nebraska Town Shy at
'â¢Tainted Money."
PAWNEE CITY, Neb., April 6. â At
i the municipal election here yesterday
; a proposition was submitted to the
â  voters to levy a two mill tax on city
property to maintain a free public
library and to accept a donation of
$7000 from* Andrew Carnegie to build
â¢ the library. The proposition was de
feated by three votes.
The opponents of the acceptance of
I the grant made extensive use of Dr.
Washington Gladdens arguments
against the acceptance by the Con
gregational Mission Board of Rocke
' feller's money, contending that Car-
I negie, like Rockefeller, had "piled up
his fortune by robbing the poor."
SELMA, April 6. â The Board of
I Trustees at a meeting last Saturday
! formally accepted a gift of $6000 from
Andrew Carnegie for a free library,
; and the citizens of the town have se
lected a site for the building. The
! report from Fresno that the gift would
i be declined is an error.

SERVIAN PRISONERS
Exasperated by Turkish Government's
Inaction Against Marauding

CONSTANTINOPLE, April Â«. â Tha
Mussulmans of Uskub. province of
Macedonia, are so exasperated at the
Government's Inaction against the
marauding bands that they have taken

who were captured after a tight with
Turkish troops In Uskub province
were taken to Kumunovo, sixteen
miles from the town of Uskub, where

JEWS OBJECT
TO THE MATCH
Special Disoatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April 6.â Not since Is
rael Zangwill, the author, married a
gentile has the orthodox East Side
been so stirred by a social sensation as
by the announcement that Rose Har
riet Pastor, a writer upon the staff of
the Jewish Daily News and a settle
ment worker in Guild House in Riving
ton street, was to marry J. G. Phelps
Stokes, son of the well-known banker,
Phelps Stokes, and brother of Rev. An
son Phelps Stokes Jr., secretary of
Yale University.
Orthodox Hebrews are confirmed in 1
the belief that Judaism has passed 1
through dangers of persecution in other |
countries to finally meet its greatest
danger in America, where freedom
tempts young folks away from strict
faith and practices. The marriage of !
Zangwill was referred to as a tragedy
by the orthodox and there were long
faces in the ghetto to-day as the story
of Miss Pastor's engagement was pass
ed from Up to lip.
Stokes said there was no difference
between the religion of Miss Pastor and
his own.
"Miss Pastor," he said, "is a Jewess
in the same sense that the apostles and
Jesus -wore Jews. She believes, as I do,
that they were Jews by tradition. She
and I are both proud of the Jewish race
and of its traditions. We both believe
that Judaism, while true, so far as it
goes, does not express as much of the
real truth as Christianity does. Our at
titude toward Judaism and Christianity
is identical. We both consider our
selves Christians. She is of Jewish an
cestry; I am not. That is the only dif
ference."
The wedding will take place on July
16. It is said that Miss Pastor, who
lived for some time in Cleveland, has
returned to her trade in an East Side
cigar factory, in order to live over
again the scenes Â«f her childhood. The
date set for the wedding is Miss Pas
tor's twenty-seventh birthday.
"It will be her rebirth," said Stokea,
in discussing his romance. "It will also
mark .a new epoch in my life. I will
then retire from the university settle
ment, and after our honeymoon will
return to the East Side to live. We will
devote our time to missions among the
poor. Our honeymoon will be spent
abroad."

"PARSIFAL"
BEGINS AT
5 P. M. SHARP
All Seat Holders Must
Be on Time or
Lose Much.
PROMPTNESS ASKED
Audience Is Notified to
Heed Manager's
Request.
At I o'olock precisely thia afternoon ;
{and not. as inadvertently misstated -
In some of the newspapers, at 8 ;
oolocJO the lons-promised and much- '
talked-of first performance of *"Parei- i
faT* will take plaoe at the Grand
Opera-house. The management, onco
more, makes a particular appeal to
all seat-holders to bÂ« In their plac
sozne minutes before the conductor,
Mr. Alfred Hertz, gives the signal for
tike oominenoement of each act, as any â 
disturbance during the performance \
\rould be harmful to the enjoyment of ;
tbe audience.
Expectation with regard to this # re
xnarkable production has for weeks i
been at fever point. Considerably over
a. hundred thousand dollars was ex
pended on "Parsifai" in Xew York be
foa>e that wonderful work â¢was pre
sented for the first time in America, '
under the auspices of Mr. Heinrich
Conrled. The greatest Wagner sing
ers in the world, the most famous ex
perts, the finest orchestra in America,
and the most eminent pictorial ar
tists, costumers and scene painters in
Vienna contributed to the sensational
ruccese which rewarded Mr. Conried's
effort. To-night's performance will tn
every way be_pn the same high lÂ»vel
of excellence as that at the Metropoli
tan Oi>era-house.
Between acts 1 and 2. as at Bay
reuth, there will be a prolonged in
termission, extending from about 6:45
to 8:45 p. m. The purpose of this
unusually long wait is to ailow oppor
tunities to the audience to recover
from the deep emotion of the first
act, to discuss the marvels of "Wag
ner's great festival play and to refresh
the inner man. It was realized by :
Richard Wagner' that the strain of
listening to three acts of "Parsifal"
without the relief afforded by a long
entr'acte would be too great for the
endurance of the average opera-goer.
The- staging of "Parsifal" in New
York was entrusted to Professor An
ton Fu.hs, who had charge of the I
me.morc.ble performances of that work ;
which were given at Munich exclusive- i
ly for the late King Ludwig of Ba- j
varia. Mr. Conried himself, however,
" superintended all the details of the
production.
s Special interest will attach to-night
â  r to the appearance for the first time in
this city of lime. Nordica in the role
of Kundry, which she studied in Bay
reuth before settling down last autumn
to the task of rehearsing the part in
New York. Alois Burgstaller, the
most interesting of living Wa.gnerian
tenors, will make his debut here as
Parsifal. Anton Van Rooy will be in
troduced to us in the stupendous role
of Amfortas. The Gurnemanz will be
Robert Blass, the favorite American
basso, Otto Goritz will make his first
appearance in San Francisco as trfe
magician, Klingsor. Mr. Muehlmann
â¢will sing the music of Titurel, and
Mme. Josephine Jacoby. who comes to
us with new laurels won in the "Stabat
Mater" at Salt Lake City three nights
ego, will interpret the small but vital
passages allotted to the Voice. Miss
Marguerite Lemon, Mme. Poehlmann,
Miss Talma and a bevy carefully
selected from the Metropolitan School
of Opera, will be seen and heard in the
ravishing- Flower Maiden episode.
Of the orchestra, which did so much
to assure the -iumph of "Parsifal" in
Hew York, it is only necessary to say
that it will be under the direction of
Alfred Hertz, who. by his admirable
and intelligent reading of "Parsifal,"
has established the reputation already
gained by his earlier Interpretations
of other "Wagnerian music-dramas.
Mr. Hertz will officiate to-night as
conductor for the first time in this
city.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 7, 1905.
GRAND OPERA
RENDERED
NOBLT.
Continued From Page 1, Column 7.
"La Donna c Mobile," given by Caruso
in a fashion that can onJy be described
as adorable.
"Rigolettos" of various kinds we have
had here. The latest was the perform
ance of the opera pulled together in
such spectacularly successful fashion
by Signor Polecco at the Tivoli, with
its equally spectacular debut of Signora
Tetrazzini as Gilda. One performance
only was included in the former Met
ropolitan seasons, a Sunday night per
formance, with a "Rigoletto" by Scottl
for which the barytone should have
been knouted: It was his best? Nay,
nay. It was not for the memory of
his "Rigoletto" that Scotti was hailed
so loudly as he came on last night.
Two acts only the barytone was able
to sing, a sudden hoarseness prevent
ing his going on with the opera. But
those two acts! Sootti gave in them
a "Rigoletto" as, finely finished, as
magnificent vocally, as pointedly and
alertly acted as ever was his never
to-be-forgotten Don Giovanni. In its
suggestion of the pathos of the hunch
backed Jester Scotti was peculiarly
happy and only the slightest hoarse
ness betrayed his vocal condition. If
I mistake not in the barytone is one
singer of the company who has
climbed great hills since he was last
here, and one heard with new delight
his most admirably smooth and sonor
ous voice. The resources of the com
pany in providing such a worthy sub
stitute as Mr. Parvis at a moment's
notice are seen to be of the exceptional
sort. Most courageously and In truly
sympathetic fashion Mr. Parv!s ac
quitted himself of his difficult task,
winning sincere applause for his ef
forts.
But to Caruso. Mario redivivus, and
the sensation of the evening. The gen
tleman in the foyer who lightly an
nounced after the first act that "Russo
had Caruso skinned to a finish" has
disappeared. He probably went and
buried himself after the "Donna c Mo
bile." He probably, too, felt like It
after the second act, after that charm-
Ing little duet between the lovers, in
which both last night flew triumph
antly up to the D flat as they finished.
Comparisons are ridiculous here. There
is one Caruso, and no second. Fine
and serious little- artist as Russo is, he
Is simply not comparable. Not among
all the tenors that we have had here,
Saleza, De March!, do any approach
this magnificently throated â or throat
less â singer. "Vocal nectar" was the
phrase that oame to me in trying to
describe the quality of the voice, and I
find no better. But the voice has so
many qualities. One hears In it the
thin, pure sweet of the flute, the full
thrill and clang of bells, the round, tri
umphant blare of the trumpet.
And from top to bottom there is not
a feather's difference in the evenness
of the note. The articulation Is flaw
less. Saying things on high c s that
every one can understand is simple fun
to Signor Caruso. Intonation? One
forgets there is such a thing as pitch
in face of its perfection in Caruso's
art. Volume? There is everything
from a dithyrambic fortissimo to a
baby sound that outfines the tiniest of
the Krelsler harmonies.
Caruso simply can and simply does
do anything and everything with his
voice. It ia impossible to imagine the
more caressingly seductive thing than
his "Donna c Mobile." He came to it
comparatively coolly. The house had
not wakened up fully to what was be
fore It. After the first verse the bravas
broke loose. In his peculiar smileless
fashion the tenor turned his big eyes
on the conductor and they repeated
the verse. The house doubled its bra
vas. And then Signor Caruso deigned
to smile. He sang the verse the third
time in a fabulously triumphant fash
lon that showed him as pleased as the
house was glad. Here to say that with
Sembrlch, Homer and Signor Parvis
the quartet was delightfully given.
It 1Â«Â« unusual to leave the Ollda to
the last, amazing when the Oilda is
the Sembrlch., still the artist Incom
parable among women slngere. It is to
hasten to say that the Sembrloh of last
night was almost â not quite â the Sem
brich who sang herself Into the bo
prano throne here as Vloletta In "La
Traviata" some three years ago. There
If still no voice so distinguished In Its
quality, of .such penetrant sweetness

ROUGH RIDERS GREET
THEIR COMMANDER
TEXAS WELCOMES PRESIDENT
Roosevelt Is Heartily Cheered
in Lone Star State.
SAN AXTONIO, Texas. April 6.â
After an eventful trip across a large
portion of Texas. President Roosevelt
arrived In San Antonio at 8:39 o'clock
to-night. When the epeclal train bear
ing 1 the President reached the station
he was greeted with cheers from thou
sands of throats, and the lusty "hur^
rahs" of hiÃ old comrades in arms, the
famouÃ Rough Riders of the SpanlshV
American War, who are holding their
annual reunion near the crumbling
wells of historic Alamo, could plainly
be heard above the din.
The city is a maze of color in honor
of the President's visit. Business
bouses and residences are decorated
with flags and bunting . and to-mor
row's exercises promise to be the most
patriotic demonstrationtlon ever held
In the State.
The PiÂ«*6id-?nt> train was run on a
Biding near the station, wh^re it will
remain until to-morrow nigrht, when
the visitors will leave for Fort Worth.
The train is beins g-uarded by a detail
of city police, and as the President will
be astir early to-morrow, every precau
tion will be tak^n to permit him to se
cure a good r.Jght'B rtst.
The President's train left Dallas
promptly at 5:30 o'clock this morning.
Its occupants were sleeping soundly
when the long run across" the State be
gran, but the President was up and astir
at 7 o'clock. The first stop of the day
wae at Hillsboro, where practically the
entire population of the town turned
out. The President spoke briefly and
was given a cordial reception.
RI3fAItKABL>E DEMONSTRATION.
When the train reached Waco can
non were fired and bands played patri
otic airs. The area about the station
and the railroad yards was packed
with humanity. A reception committee
made its way to the President's car
riage and he was escorted to a stand in
the city park near by. His appearance
was the signal for a remarkable dem
onstration. Thousands of tiny Ameri
can flags were waved by men and wo
men alike, and it was several minutes
before the President could begin his
address. The band played the stirring
strains of "Dixie," and the President
Fmiled and beat tin\e to the music. The
President's address was brief and he
was frequently applauded.
The President returned to his train
> with difficulty, so great was the crowd.
As the train moved away he 6tood upon \
the rear platform and waved his hand
to the people.
The train glided swiftly across the
â  plains of North Texas and at noon en
tered the fertile valley of the Brazos.
Several stops were made, and one espe
cialy Interested the President because
of the manner in which it occurred.
â When the citizens of Temple learned
that the train would not stop at iheir
city a hurried call of the City Council
was made. The city fathers immediate
ly passed an emerrency ordinance re
quiring the train to stop at the station
three minutes. When this news was
U legrspbei the President he laughed
heartily and seemed pleased. He im
mediately issued Instructions that the
stop be made. Nearly the whole popu
lation of the little city was on hand and
the greetin? accorded the chief execu
tive was ni.,st hearty.
ARRIVES IN AUSTIN.
At Taylor, which was reached at 12:30
o'clock, the train was switched from
the track of the Missouri. Kansas and
Texas^liailroad to that of the Interna
tional and Great Northern road, and
the run to Austin began. The capital
city was reached at 2 o'clock. President
| Roosevelt was met at the station by
Governor Lanham, Lieutenant Gov
ernor Neil and a committee of thirty
; citizens and members of the Texas
Legislature. The President was in ex
cellent spirits and appeared none the
worse for his long ride across the coun
try. He expressed himself as being
most pleased to arrive In Austin under
euch auspicious circumstances. The en
tire party were placed in carriages and
driven to the State House, where Pres
ident Roosevelt made two speeches, one
, in the hall of the House of Representa
tives and the other on the lawn. The
President was taken for a drive over
the city. The day was ideal, and so
.crowded were the streets that it proved
a difficult matter for the militia to con
trol the vast throngs. The school chil
dren of the city, both white and black,

were lined up for review along the line
of march and cheered lustily as the
President passed.
One of the most enthusiastic demon
strations of the day occurred at New
Braunfels. When the train arrived
there it was surrounded by a dense
mass of surging people, all anxious to
greet the chief executive. New Braun
fels is a German settlement and is
noted for its thrift and enterprise, and
the President spoke encouragingly to
the people, who cordially applauded his
utterances.
The long ride was brought to an end
when San Antonio was reached, shortly
before 9 o'clock.
COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., April
6. â A heavy snowfall in the mountains
around Red Stone, Colo., may necessi
tate a change in the plans for President
Roosevelt's Rocky Mountain outing.
Philip B. Stewart of this city, who is
in charge of the local arrangements
for the trip, to-day received a note
from 'Jake' Borah, who is to be one
of the President's guides, giving Infor
mation of the conditions at Red Stone.
"I learn from Borah's note,"' said
Stewart, "that the snow In the upper
country is very deep, which may neces
sitate starting out at a point consider
ably below Red Stone. It may prove to
be advisable to leave the train at a
point below Newcastle, on the Grand
River, thence strike out to camp,
gradually working in the direction of
Red Stone as the weather will permit."
"SQUARE DEAL" DOCTRINE.
President Describes His Attitude
Toward the Railroads.
AUSTIN, Texas, April 6.â ln his
epeech to the Texas Legislature to-day
President Roosevelt, in referring to the
interstate commerce act, said:
"I do not wish in any shape or way
to interfere with the legitimate gam of
any of these great men whose special
industrial capacity enables them to
handle the railroads so as to be of pro
fit to themselves and of advantage to
all of us. I should be most reluctant â
I will put it stronger than that â I
shouid absolutely refuse to be a party
to any measure, to any proposition that
interfered with the proper and legiti
mate prosperity of those men.
"The public has a right, not a privi
lege, but in my view a duty to see that
there is in its behalf exercised such a
supervisory and regulatory power
over the railroads as will insure that
while they give fair treatment them
selves, they get it in return.
"I know perfectly well that when you
give that power there is a chance of its
being occasionally abused. There is no
power that can be given to the repre
sentative of the public which it is not
possible to abuse. As every one knows,
the power of taxation, which must, of
course, be given to the representatives
of the people, is the power of death, for
it is possible to kill any industry by
excessive taxation. There must be a
certain trust placed in the common
sense and common honesty of those
who are to enforce the law. If It ever
falls, and I think it will, to my lot to
nominate a board to carry out such a
law I shall nominate men as far as I
am able on whose ability, courage and
integrity I can count â men who will
not be swayed by any influence what
ever, direct or indirect, social, political
or any other, to show improper favorit
ism for the railroads and who, on the
other hand, if a railroad is unjustly at
tacked, no matter if the attack has be
hind it the feeling of prejudice of 99
per cent of the people, will stand up
against that attack. That is my inter
pretation of the doctrine of the square
deal."
ROL'GH RIDERS* REUNION.
Names of Four Distinguished Soldiers
Added to Roll.
SAN' ANTONIO, Tex., April 6. â
The fullest reunion in the history of
the Rough Riders is in progress .in

the afternoon in business session. Of
ficers were elected as follows: Pres
ident, C. E. Hunter, Indian Territory;
first vice president, David CJoodrich,
Indian Territory; secretary, Robert
Colbert, Indian Territory.
Probably the most striking feature
of the business session was the se
lection of honorary members. Those
chosen were Lieutenant General S. B.
M. Young, Major General Joseph
Wheeler (retired), Major General
Samuel Sumner and Brigadier Gen
eral Charles T. Cooper (retired).

LONDON, April 7. â The correspond
ent at St. Petersburg of the Times
telegraphs:
"The latest official information leads
to the belief that the Japanese are ad
vancing in crescent formation, Oku on
the left, Nodzu in the center and Ku
roki and Kawamura on the right, and
with a total strength of 475,000. It is
ftared that Linevitch will be compelled
to withdraw."
ST. PETERSBURG, April 7.âln
valided Russians who left Mukden 'on
March 26 report that the Hun River
bridge had not then been restored. The
Japanese, in removing Russian wound
ed from Mukden, carried them as far
as the river in bamboo litters and en
trained them on the farther side. Chin
ese, it is related by these returned
soldiers, partly pillaged the hospitals in
Mukden on March 10 before the ar
rival of the Japanese, but did not harm
the wounded or the attendants and a^t
ed most humanely toward Russian
wounded on the field, assisting the
Japanese in gathering them.
Russian medical army officers recog
nized in the adjutant of General Oku's
fifth division a former professor of
languages in the seminary of Vladi
vostok. They also met other Japanese
officers who formerly were in the Rus
sian service in Manchuria.
The returned soldiers describe the
confusion in the evacuation of Muk
den and the fighting in the narrow
streets and at the gates, where Japan
ese and Chinese ambushed the last de
tachments and where General Gale
feldt was wounded and captured.
The losses of the Japanese, accord
ing to the foreigners accompanying
them, were nearly 100,000; the eighth
division, for Instance, losing more than
7000 men, yet not being considered one
of the heavy sufferers. The greatest
losses were among the troops operating
against General Linevitch, where the
struggle was much longer and of more
intensity.
The Japanese placed the number of
guns captured during the retreat at
twenty-six and they also captured
thousands of abandoned rifles and im
mense quantities of boxed rifle ammu
nition. According to the Chinese, the
Japanese are now rearming their re
seines with Russian rifles.
The Japanese army is healthy, ex
cellently clothed and well shod, and its
morale is excellent, according to these
soldiers.
Japanese officers admitted that they
concentrated every last effort to wjn
the battle and threw their entire re
serves into the fighting line, leaving the
rear communications entirely unpro
tected. They realized that, had the
Russians thrown a heavy force, even
of cavalry, in the rear, their position
would have been critical; but they
counted rightly on Russian inertia and
were confident of victory.
RUSSIAN CAVALRY ATTACKS.
Force of Japanese Infantry Dislodged
From Two Positions.
ST. PETERSBURG, April 6.â A
dispatch to the War Office from Chief
of staff Karkevitch, dated to-day,
says that a Russian-Korean detach
ment attacked a force of Japanese in
fantry about five miles from Kiljou.
and that the Japanese were dislodged
from two positions and dispersed by
the Russian fire and Cossack attacks.
The dispatch adds that Japanese de
tachments have appeared on the Man
darin road, between Chengtufu and
Unalmaikai, on the Russian front.
Japan to Borrow More Money.
TOKIO, April 6.â lt is expected
that one-half of the domestic loan will
be allotted to foreigners whose bids
exceed the whole issue. At this rate
the treasury is planning a fifth do

May. The terms of (he loan will be

LOUNGERS IN THE LOBBY.

trained from requesting details.
That dialogue occurred after the first
act. When the next curtain descended
the fat man repeated his question and
the admirer of Russo confessed to hav
ing been premature in his judgment.
"Although," he said, "I will not say
this fellow has Rusbo skinned until he
has sung that lal-lal-la-la-la thing in
the fourth act."
"You mean the 'Dano c Mobile? 1 "
said the fat man.
"I said nothing about an automobile,"
responded the wise one. "I mean that
lal-lal-la-la-la thing that Russo used to
knock 'em silly with."
One of the men, who candidly ac
knowledged that he knew but'little of
vocal music, was Lieutenant Governor
Alden Anderson, who came all the way
from Suisun to see the show. "It's a
great spectacle," he laughingly said
when asked to express his opinion of
the performance in general and Caru
so's part of it in particular.
Former Mayor Phelan was there, of
course, and either modestly reserved
his opinions or confided them to his
immediate associates. Jeremiah Lynch,
who has heard grand opera where it is
fostered, also abstained from ventilat
ing his views for the public enlighten
ment. And among those present who
courteously listened and said but little
were Moses Gunst, E. S. Pillsbury, Au
gustus Taylor, Superior Judge Lawlor
and Paul Cowles, all of whom are qual
ified by experience to distinguish a
nightingale from a buzzsaw in the
making of sound. But perhaps the
man who had the very least to say was
"Doc" Leahy, the Tivoli impresario,
although he was beset o-n all sides to
disclose what ho thought of each in
dividual singer, the orchestra, the en
semble, the staging â everything per .
taining to the "Rigoietto" production.
His was the reticence of professional
prudence.
Speaking of "Doc" Leahy and the
Tivoli is remindful of the agitation
that possessed the lobby until assured
that Tettrazini was not in the audi
ence The partisans of the great little
songbird â and they were both numer
ous and vehement â compared her voice
with that of Sembrich to the latter's
disadvantage, while just as many pu
tative experts in the art vocal declared
that when Tettrazini has attained more
years and experience she may have as
brilliant an expression, but never as
rare a range or melodious a quality as
the fully-matured artist. On this sub
ject debate frequently waxed warm
among certain lobbyists.
Away up in the top lobby, where chil
dren of Italy mostly congregated, the
clothes show was hardly worth looking
at, but the criticism seemed to be re
flective of keen intelligence.
BALLOONS FAIL TO CROSS
THE CHANNEL TO FRANCE
LONDON. April 6. â Four balloons
started this afternoon in a cross
channel contest from different points
in the south of England with the in
tention of landing in France. The
unique sporting event was under the
auspices of the AÂ«ro Club of Great
Britain. M. Faure, the member of
the French Aero Club, who success
fully undertook the same voyage two
months ago, again participated. The
English balloons, each of 45,000 to
50,000 feet capacity, started respec
tively from Westham. the Crystal Pal
ace and Seven Oaks, while M. Faure
started from Folkestone. A good
northwest wind was blowing.
Three of the balloons descended be
fore reaching the channel. The one
which left the Crystal Palace came
down on a field near Hastings, the
second, from Westham, grounded four
miles inland from Haulings, and the
balloon from Seven Oaks descended
ten miles inland.
Faure was delayed and made his

GIRL PERJURER
NOT FRIENDLESS
SPRINGFIELD, 111., April 6.-In the
upper house of the Legislature to-day
an unusual resolution was presented.
It bears on the case of Miss Inga Han
sen, a former Salvation Army girl of
Chicago, who recently was found guilty
of perjury and given an indefinite sen
tence in the penitentiary- The resolu
tion requests the Governor to have the
case investigated, and then, if in his
judgment the case warrants it, to pre
vent Miss Hansen being sent to the
penitentiary and to grant her a full
pardon.
Miss Hansen's conviction was the
outgrowth of a suit for 150,000 damages
brought by her against the Chicago
Railway Company, in which she
alle^pd that she had been deprived of
her sight and speech and the use of her
limbs as the result of injuries re
ceived in a street-car accident. She
claimed that her partial recovery was
a miracle wrought by prayer, while the
company alleged that her Injuries were
only pretended.
The resolution cites the statement
made some time ago that the railroad
company had expanded $50,000 in se
curing the conviction of the young
woman, and the fact that many per
sons believe her innocent. The resolu
tion was made a special order for
Tuesday.

TWO PHONES ARE
GREAT NUISANCE
Portlander Tells Council What
He Discovered of Dual System
in California.
PEOPLE ARE HEARTILY
TIRED OF THE BURDEN
Fight to the Death in Los Angeles
Between Automatic and Old
Company.
There is considerable difference ot
opinion regarding the Installation of an
other telephone system in this city.
Many business men on whom much of the
inconvenience of two systems will fall do
not favor it. Business men who havo
been to Southern California say two tele
phones work a hardship on the people
and that annoyances continually arige
from the dual system.
A member of the firm of Woodard
Clarke & Co. has Just returned from Los
Angeles, where he made a careful inves
tigation of the conditions, resulting In
the following communication to the
Mayor and Common Council:
A BURDEN AND A NUISANCE.
"Hon. George IL Williams â Dear Sir-
A recent visit of a member of the firm to
Southern California, extending over six
wt-pks. enabled me while In l,os Angeles
to look into the question of the telephone
service in that city, and In view of the
pending franchise for a 6econd company
In this city a result of his observations
may be of some interest to you.
"A consensus of opinion, with business
men and a preat many private citizens
of Los Angeles, seems to be that the ex
istence of two phones in that city is a
burden, a nuisance and an unnecessary
expense. Each company has its particular
friends, who declare that its particular
phone is the best, while all agree there Is
one company too many. The physicians
have entered Into an agreement to take
one phone out. Business houses which
originally espoused the cause of the new
company find that their service charges
have been practically doubled, while the
service is very little better. The pres
ence of two phones ringing simultane
ously in a business office is 'but one
phase of the annoyance; another is the
difficulty of distinguishing, when the
party called is not in the room, which
phone must be answered.
FIGHT FOR THE FIELD.
"One Individual interviewed was of the
opinion that eventually there would be
but one system â the one with the short
est purse would be the first to give In
"These are unbiased observations we
have no pecuniary interest of any
nature whatsover in the present tel
ephone company of this city. We
have a private exchange installed
for which we believe we are pay
ing more than it is worth, but deplore
extremely the prospect of a possible ne
cessity of another, and it seems to us
that the franchise now held by the pres
ent company would admit of proper reg
ulation in the matter of charges and the
securing of better service by the Council
We sincerely hope you will at any rate
defer the granting of this franchise un
til the matter can be more fully Investi
gated. WOODARD, CLARKE A CO."

ARMOR STANDS
A SEVERE TEST
WASHINGTON, April 6.â The result
of the tests at Indian Head proving
grounds ypsterday, the purpose of
which was to determine the resisting
power of warships to the different
types of shells which may be hurled
against them in time of action, was
satisfactory to the officers of the navy
and army who witnessed them, as is
shown by the following statement given
out to-day at the bureau of ordnance
of the Navy Department:
"An Interesting test took place at tne
naval proving ground at Indian Head
yesterday in the presence of a large
number of officers of the navy and
army. A target structure representing
in all details a section of one of the
armored cruisers of the Tennessee class
was attacked by shells fired from six
inch and eight-Inch guns with the same
striking velocities which these shells
would have had if fired in service at
ranges of 2700, 3000, 4000 and 4500 yards.
Some of these shells were loaded with
black powder and some with high ex
plosive.
"The object of the test was to deter
mine the resisting power of,,the ships
to the different types of shells by which
they would be attacked in action.
"The result was very satisfactory, in
dicating that these ships may be ex
pected to stand up well against the
guns of any ships to which they will
naturally be opposed. At the end of the
test the target, although considerably
damaged locally, was intact so far as
its structural element was concerned."

SUSTAIN SMITH
AS A PROPHET
SALT LAKE, April 6.â Joseph F.
Smith was sustained as prophet, seer
and revelator by unanimous vote of the
members of the Mormon church at the
opening session of the seventy-fifth an
nual conference to-day. When the vote
was taken to sustain the twelve apos
tles, two hands were raised in dissent.
One of the dissenters arose to explain
his vote, but ias not permitted to
sp"Â£Â»k, President Smith merely stating
that he could present his objections to
the proper authorities. The Incident
created a profound sensation. The
members who dissented afterward
stated that they desired to protest
against sustaining such officers of the
church as live in polygamy.
Among the apostles sustained were
Apostles Taylor and Cowley. In his
testimony before the Senate investigat
ing committee at Washington, Senator
Smoot stated that an Investigation was
being made by the church into the
charges that these two apostles had
taken polygamous wives since the
manifesto and that if the charges were
proven he would not vote to sustain
Taylor and Cowley. Senator Smoot
was not present 10-day, nor - c Apos
tles Taylor and Cowley.
MORE VICTIMS
OF MENINGITIS
CHICAGO. April Â«.â Five new cases
of cerebral spinal meningitis of the
malignant kind have been found in Chi

NEW YORK, April 6.â Experiments
carried out at the Gouverneur Hospital
in this city have resulted in the deci
sion by the medical staff that there is
no hope of establishing a cure for cere
bro-meningitis by the use of diphtheria
antitoxin. After trials from January
20 to date It was found that a death
rate of the same percentage prevailed
as last year, when the antitoxin was
not used.
Meantime the epidemic continues its
spread through all the territory within
250 miles. There were eighteen deaths
en "Wednesday in Greater New York.
Between Saturday noon and the same
hour Wednesday there were forty
seven deaths in Manhattan, against
forty-six in the four days of the pre
vious week. Since Saturday noon there
have been seven deaths in the Bronx,
against four in the entire week pre
vious.

TO A
GROCER'S
CLERK
What if the cream of the
business in San Francisco
is done by peddlers ?
Where are your wages to
come from? What chance
have you, unless you turn
peddler?
Three-quarters of the city
tea trade is believed to be
in the hands of peddlers
now; we don't know.
What is true of tea is
true of coffee, though gro-
cers appear to think the
proportion is less. We
don't see it. The peddler
sells both ; the woman buys
both. Spices and extracts
too.
Butter is going the same
way. What next? Is the
grocer going? When ped-
dlers leave him nothing but
sugar, salt, flour, tomatoes,
Royal baking-powder, Bak-
er's cocoa, Fels - Naptha
soap, and Eagle milk, is he
going to keep-on or quit?
There's no money for you
in a business stripped of its
profits.
Our reason for raising the
question with you is this:
We are asking your em-
ployers to join in appealing
to buyers of groceries not
to destroy the business by
. buymg of peddlers.
You art a part of the
plan. If you want to be in
it, talk with them. Now or
never.
This is not our war. The
trouble is local; our trade is
from Mexico to Alaska and
East.
Our poMqr is to support
the retail grocer all over the
Wfestern States,
Wfcftl make it our war if
the^rocers are ready. Talk
with them.

Its Hopes and Aims
PLANS OVERTHROW
OF THE ROMANOFFS
Democratic liepublic to Be
Built Tpon the Ruins
of the Present Despotic
Form of Government
MOSCOW, April 6. â The Central
Committee of the Social Revolutionary
party has drawn up a document con
taining the main points of its pro
gramme and of this hundreds of thou
sands of copies are being printed for
circulation in all parts of European
Russia. The first and main point is the
establishment of a democratic repub
lic on the ruins of the autocracy, and,
besides the usual points of social demo
cratic doctrine, it includes many argu
ments especially directed to Russian
conditions and designed to appeal to
the self-interest of the Russian pro
letariat, both agricultural aad indus
trial. It voices phrases familiar to the
American ear, such as "initiative and
referendum," "public ownership of
public utilities," etc.
The committee demands the institu
tlbn of a democratic republic, with
broad autonomy for the provinces, mu
nicipalities and communes; the widest
application of the federal principle to
the relations between the various na
tionalities; a direct secret universal baU
lot, â without distinction as to sex, na
tionality or religion; proportional rep
resentation; direct popular legislation,
wth the initiative and referendum;
electiblllty, responsibility and remova
bility of all officials; separation of
church and state; complete freedom of
conscience, speech, the press, assem
bly and association; the right to strike;
compulsory popular and gratuitous
education and abolition of the stand
ing army and substitution of a national
militia.
Under the head of national economy,
It favors an eight-hour day, with a re
duction for the more dangerous and un
sanitary occupations; a minimum wage
scale; state insurance for all, the forms
regulated by the insured at the expense
of the state and employers; regulation
of factory construction; prohibition of
child labor below 16 and of female la
bor at certain occupations, and pro
fessional organization of workmen with
an increasing share in the internal
management of institutions.
In agrarian policy the party declares
the earth is the common heritage of all
citizens and demands the socialization
of all land, or such approach to aboli
tion of private ownership as is prac
ticable, including the sequestration of
crown, church and state lands, turning
them over to the communes, and the
limitation and conversion of rents into
an income tax, payable to the com
mune.
In the realm of finance the party fa
vors progressive income and inheri
tance taxes inapplicable to small In
comes; the abolition of indirect taxes
and the protective system except as to
objects of luxury. It also favors the
common ownership of all utilities, med
ical assistance gratis, development of
co-operation on strictly democratic
principles and measures tending to the
independence of the working classes
of governmental bureaucracy.

STOP FIGHT
At Stormy Meeting Conserv
ative 3f embers of Board De
mand That Alexander and
Hyde Cease Quarreling
SQUABBLE HURTS
SOCIETY'S BUSINESS
Temporary Truce Is Estab
lished by the Adoption of
Resolution Amending the
Charter of the Corporation
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. April 6.â By the adop
tion of an amendment to the charter
the board of directors of the Equitable
Life Assurance Society to-day estab
lished a temporary truce in the fight
which has been going on for weeks be-
Iwesn the Alexander and the Hyde fac
tions in the society. This was accom
plished at a meeting of the board at
which thirty- eight of the fifty direct
ors were present.
The meeting was characterized by
the most bitter contention between tho
rival factions. Personalities were in
dulged in which brought to their feet
many of the members of the board In
emphatic protest. These directors de
clared that the time had come for the
more conservative members of the
board to take a hand in the quarrel be
tween Alexander and Hyde. They de
manded that both sides stop the war
that was having such disastrous effect
upon the society. They declared that
these attacks made by the rival fac
tions weTe ruining the business of the
society and causing public opinion to
rise against it.
Several of the speakers urged Alex
ander in no uncertain terms to stop his
attacks on Hyde and the management
of the society. They criticized both the
president and the vice president for
having made public through newspa
pers their personal opinions regarding
the integrity of the directors.
In all the speeches there was strong
Jrtlmation that if such conduct was not
immediately stopped the directors as a
body would be compelled to take offi
cial action.
A new feature in the Equitable mat
ter is the resolution adopted for the
appointment of a committee of seven,
headed by E, H. Harriman, to thor
oughly investigate the Equitable af
fairs.
Tho original plan for the mutualiza
tion of the company provided that it
should be accomplished in four years,
but after last week's sessions with the
State Superintendent of Insurance this
was amended to make the time two
yenrs. The two year plan was ac
quiesced in by Hyde. The plan begins
to take effect on December 1 next.
The following statement was given
out at the close of the meeting of the
directors:
"The board of directors, after full
discussion, unanimously adopted the
amended charter approved at the meet
ing with the Superintendent of Insur
ance, the amendment being: 'The board
of directors' shall continue to be di
vided into four classes of thirteen each.'
"Speeches were made by James J.
Hill, Melville E. Ingalls, John A. Stew
art, Charles Stewart Smith, Brayton
Ives, T. DeWltt Cuyler and others, In
eisting upon a cessation of the entire
controversy and the use of the press,
which is so injurious to the company.
That, while in the charges and the
counter charges there was no question
as to the solvency of the company or
its large surplus abÂ»ve all liabilities,
or the eoundness of its Investments, the
controversy was creating widespread
distrust and doing great injury to all
life insurance companies, and that the
committee of the board should and
would so probe and as a result of their
investigation en recommend as to jus
tify confidence In the company and its
management.

RESULTS IN TRAGEDIES
Ten Years Elapse Between

Society and the Fruition

Special Dispatch to TbÂ» Call.
BRIDGEPORT, Conn., April 6.âOr
ganized ten years ago by thirteen con
genial spirits, who derided supersti
tion, Bridgeport's so-called Suicide
Club" has been dissolved by the death
of its president and last remaining
member, Daniel Loeser. Ha was the
only one who did not die by his own
hand.
There has always been more or less
mystery around the association's pro
ceedings, but details of its formation
are well known. Its membership was
made up largely of German Americans,
who met in the evenings in various re
sorts to drink beer and play pinochle,
and it was at one of these merry meet
ings that the talk of a "suicide club"
was started.
The suggestion was accepted and it
was decided to limit the membership
to thirteen. Not long after that first
night only twelve men assembled at
the appointed place. The announce
ment was made that John McKenzie,
who had just returned from Switzer
land, had shot himself.
Whatever shock or surprise this may
have been to the other members, it did
not disrupt the society. George Leav
enworth, city editor of the Bridgeport
Farmer, was a member, and on the
morning that a humorous article on
the club appeared in his paper he waa
found dead with an empty bottle that
had contained carbolic acid lying beside
him.
For a year there were no breaks in
ranks. Then Victor Heisterhagen went
into a cellar and shot himself.
Alexander Heatherington was the
fourth to die. He shot himself.
"Jack" Eichel, a blacksmith, followed
within a brief time in the same manner.
Walter Mickel, a p.ainter, hanged
himself.
A few more weeks passed and Wal
lace Zepp, a saloon-keeper, was I'ound
drowned, and John Meyer shot him
self in his meat market.
Gustav Wolf, a diamond expert,
chose a similar manner of death, and
about a year later Michael Horat drank
carbolic acid.
Several years went by without fur
ther reductions and then Oscar Beers,
who had twice tried to kill himself,
succeeded with a razor.
George Wagner shot himself In a
New York hotel last fall.
MAKES DEMAND
FOR IN ELECTION
NAPA, April 6.-- Â»At a special meeting
of the City Council held this afternoon
Attorney W. T. Rutherford of Napa j
appeared and made a sensational de- j
mand on the Council. He asked that |
the Council call a municipal election, j
to be held May 1, 1905, to elect a Mayor, \
City Engineer, City Attorney, City |
Marshal and City Clerk. The Council i
had already called an election for that ;
date to select three Councilmen from i
the wards, but took the position that !
the other officers were not to be elected I
this year. Rutherford contended that |
in February, 1903, the city of Napa by j
vote adopted an amendment to the j
charter which changed the terms of the !
Mayor, Engineer, Attorney, Marshal j
and Clerk from two to four years, and ;
also stated that for the purpose of reck- I
onlng the first election was to be dated |
1903, the second 1907, the third 1911 and j
so on.
City Attorney York rendered an opin- !
ion that the position of Rutherford
was not correct and that the five of- j
fleers should not be elected till 1907. The ;
Council then refused to grant the de- ;
mand of Rutherford for a call for an !
election. He will Immediately bring a
mandamus suit in the Superior Court [
to direct the Council to issue the call |
for the election as he requests.
IjOVE-CRAZED GARDENER
KILLS A SCHOOLTEACHER
REDDING, April 6.â J. H. Gregory, i
a gardener living near Mott station, â 
five miles south of Sisson, shot and ;
killed Miss Annie R. Miller, a teacher :
of the Mott school last night, and then
blew his own brains out. Gregory was
courting Miss Miller and when she |
spurned his offer of marriage he be
came angered. Last night he met her â 
at the depot and walked with her to '
the gate of the Maxwell home, where
she lived. He repeated his offer of
marriage and when she refused him '
and started to go in the house he drew i
a pistol and shot her through the head.
He then killed himself.
Miss Miller was engaged to I* H.
Oaborn, owner of a shingle mill at
Sisson. Her folks live at Fort Jones,
Siskiyou County. Gregory has a
brother in Redding and one in Port

LETTERS HOLD
NEW CLEWS
Seized Correspondence Adds
to the Weight of Evidence
Against "Nan" Patterson
FATHER'S GRAVE ERROR
Reveals Information in His
Missives to the Sister
of the Tombs Prisoner
Special Dispatch to The CaTV
NEW YORK, April 6.â District At
torney Jerome and his assistants will
take up the trial of "Nan" Patterson
next Monday with more confidence
than they felt at the beginning of the
two previous attempts to convict her.
Letters found In the trunk of Mrs. J.
Morgan Smith after her arrest in Cin
cinnati have supplied clews for new
lines of evidence upon which Jerome
and Assistant District Attorney Rand
hope to build up a case much stronger
than they presented before. The call-
Ing of J. Randolph Patterson, father
of the prisoner, before the Grand Jury
yesterday was, it is understood, in re
lation to these letters. After the elder
Patterson had been examined Rand
could not conceal his Jubilation; nor
could the fact that the elder Patterson
had revealed secrets under pressure in
the Grand Jury room be kept confined
within the limits of the District Attor
ney's office.
There could be but one reason for the
calling of Patterson before the Grand
Jury. He was In Washington at the
time of the shooting of "Caesar" Young
and had no knowledge at first hand
of the events that led up to the
tragedy. That he should be subpenaed
a few hours after the arrival of the
package of Smith letters from Cincin
nati indicates that he was called to
Identify some of the letters. Natural
ly he could not be expected to identify
letters written by any other person
than himself.
From the deeply worried expression
on his face when he left the Grand
Jury and from the gratified ex
pression on the face of Rand, it Is in
ferred that in the trunkful of letters
there were found some from J. Ran
dolph Patterson to his daughter, Mrs.
J. Morgan Smith.
Patterson was with "Nan" every
day during the two trials and visited
her often afterward. Naturally, in
writing to his other daughter, he would
refer frequently to conversations with
"Nan," and in all likelihood the Dis
trict Attorney has been able to pick
new threads of evidence from these
revelations.
Just after he was called before the
Grand Jury yesterday Patterson visit
ed "Nan" in her cell in the Tombs. He
left her very depressed.
Thus far the most damaging evi
dence against her has been given indi
rectly by members of her own family.
That the Smiths should be the cause
of supplying new evidence and that her
father should be an involuntary agent
in strengthening the case of the Dis
trict Attorney has flung the young
woman into despajr.
Patterson appeared at the Grand Jury
rooms to-day in answer to a subpena
that was served upon him at the con
clusion of his testimony yesterday,
but Assistant District Attorney Rand
was so busy that he was excused. He
will go before the Grand Jury again to
morrow.

BODY IS FOUND
UNDER A HOUSE
LOB ANGELES. April 6.â Late this
afternoon boys discovered the body of
a young woman under a house at 1130
East Pico street. There Is no doubt
but the body Is that of Mary
White, and it Is probable that she com
mitted suicide. An aunt of Miss Whit*
lives in the house under which the body
was found.
The girl visited her aunt on the day
she disappeared ten days ago. The last
seen of her was when she left the
house. An opening in the foundation
of the house at the rear furnished a
means of entrance, and it is thought
that the girl took poison and crawled
under the house to die. She had com
plained of being in ill health.

AD CLUB BANQUETS
ARTHUR F. SHELDON
Guest Talks of Business Methods
(PROFESSOR ARTHUR FREDERICK SHELDON, THE EASTERN ADVEnYIrING
EXPERT WHO DELIVERED AN ENTERTAINING AND INSTRUCTIVE
TTHE AT THE MEETING OF THE AD CLUB LAST NIGHT.
. Th<* science of modern business build
ing was ably discussed by Arthur Fred
erick Sheldon of Chicago at a banquet
given in his honor by the Ad Club at
the Palace Hotel last evening. Sheldon
is not only a forceful talker, but an
orator who is brimful of peculiar wit
that holds his auditors for any length
of time he may see fit to address
them. LMt night he was exceedingly
interesting throughout an hour of talk
ing, and when he had finished his hear
ers were as willing that he should con
tinue as he was apparently willing to
quit. In a most clever manner he ana
lyzed the average business man, plac
ing: considerable emphasis on his faults
and picturing plainly his virtues. He
also dealt at considerable length upon
the relations between the salesman and
his customer and showed how often the
"ad" man and not the man behind the
counter is responsible for the profits
accruing to the employer.
The speaker strongly advocated the
necessity of truthfulness in all busi
ness dealings, declaring that without It
enterprise could not prosper with any
degree of certainty. Elevation of char
acter was essential in all business
houses, and he gave many illustrations
of how the average businessman has a
failing in this respect.
Sheldon was followed by Henry We;n
stock, the well known Sacramento mer
chant, who spoke of the use of the su
perlative in advertising, a subject
which his many years of experience in
this city and Sacramento has made him
familiar with.
The banquet was attended by about
150 representatives of the advertising
departments of the lQcal papers and the
various agencies.

Clash Between Policemen

Cause of Bloody Affray
ROW OVER AN ELECTION
Thirty Shots Are Fired in
Fracas That Follows the
Arrest of a Negro Voter
HUNTINGTON, W. Va., April 6.â
Policeman Roy Hill was fatally
wounded. Deputy Sheriff H. Adkins se
riously wounded, and W. T. Lilly, a by
stander, shot in the shoulder in a re
volver duel between Adkins and several
policemen to-day. The fight was
caused by a dispute over authority in
the city election.
Feeling is bitter on both sides, and
further trouble may result before the
day is over. The city officials, who are
Republicans, appointed forty special
policemen. while the Democratic
county officials appointed a large num
ber of deputy sheriffs. Conflicts be
tween the two sets of officers came
when Policeman Hill and another offi
cer arrested two deputy sheriffs as they
were in the act of arresting a negro
charged with repeating. The deputy
sheriffs resisted and Deputy Adkins
came to their assistance. In the revol
ver duel that ensued thirty shots were
lired.
Adkins and the other deputies were
placed under arrost. The shooting oc
curred on the most crowded street in
the city and it is remarkable that no
more than the above officers were seri
ously wounded. Deputy Sheriffs Ennis
Bayliss and Henry Nash and one po
liceman. Hurt Foster, were also wound
ed, but their injuries are less serious.
The windows of the city hall were rid

Great Artists Praise
â â A Great Piano""
Mrne. Marcella Sembrii li. who ap- Mme. N'ordira. wM BSMUM to-
ppurr-d last night in â¢'Rigolettn" : night as Kundry. in 'Parsifal":
"The Kimbill ranks with the best "The more I use my Kimball piano
instruments before the world." the better I like it."
Scmbrich and Nordica
What These Great Artists Say oi the Kimball
Pianoâ Warm Words of Praise From Both
In ap' aki'iK of the Kimball piano, Mme. Sembrich says: "Tho Kimball ranks
with the bf?Â»t instruments before the world." Mme. Nordica says: "The more I
use my Kimball piano the better 1 like it." Here is a direct and positive judgment
by what may be termed the Court of T^-i.st Resort, and the decision certainly fixes
th^ position of th<^ Kimhall piano. It places it in the highest rank "with the best
instruments before the world." The Kimball muy be euualed, but it cannot be ex-
eellcd.
Pontimer-Kilers are the exclusive agents for the Kimball piano In this terrl-
tory. They have already placed them in some of the finest homes and studios In
California, and they now have mi liand in their temporary wareronms the largest,
finest and most varied stock of Kimball pianos carried by any house west of the
Mississippi River. The entire line is new, Rnd includes the most artistic instru-
ments ever turned out by the Kimball factory. If you respect the judgment of
Nordica fÂ»nd Sembrich on matters musical, you should inspect the Pommer-Eiler9
stock at 514 Market street. All pianos go at tremendous reductions during the
great "L'nloaUing Sale."
SOME OF THE OTHER LINES
Ueside the Kimball. we carry a long line of other hiph-grade pianos. We
carry the Hazelton. the Decker, the Lester, the Hallett &. Davis and other makes
of almost Â«qual standing. These are pianos of known worth, and they are all of
the latest make. When we moved into our temporary quarters two months ago
we transferred from the old store only four pianos. Since then wo have received
twenty-four carloads â nearly three hundred pianos. We have over two hundred
now on hand and these we are selling at astonishing reductions.
WHY WE ARE UNLOADING
As previously stated, we are offering enormous concessions because our
warerooms are crowded to the limit, because our contracts with manufacturers
do not permit us to stop buying and because we have not been able in our pres-
ent temporary location to sell our pianos as rapidly as we did at our old store.
We are therefore determined to offer such prices as will bring buyers to our
store even though it is a few steps out of the ordinary run of retail shopping. It
may cost an extra nickel to bring you to our store, but that nickel spent now
will save you from 150 to $200 on the purchase of a piano.
SOME PRICES AND TERMS
We offer you a choice of the very finest of regular $500 styles of pianos â
among them the most elegant of Mission and Colonial stylesâ at prices ranging
from $367 down to $288. Terms of payment $25 down and $10 a month.
The very best regular $350 and $400 pianos, fully warranted and brand-new,
fresh and choice, direct from the factories, and the latest of 1906 designs, cost
now $247, $235 and $218. Terms, $15 down and $8 a month.
Carloads of strictly reliable regular $260 and $300 pianos will go during the
next two weeks for $126, $137 and $158. Terms $8 down and $5 or $6 monthly.
Every instrument we sell is guaranteed. We deliver pianos free to any part
of the city.
USED PIANOS IN MANY MAKES
Our third floor continues to fill up with used pianos. We have sold many, but
others continue to come in daily in part payment for new pianos. We have got
in a number of practically new pianos in exchange for our new Auto-piano. The

Pease mahogany ease. $500 Colonial style, now $218; Ste-lnway $246; Roth A Co.

LADY CURZON'S
NARROW ESCAPE
Massive Chimney Dislodged
by Earthquake Crashes
Through Roof of Dwelling
DEATH LIST GROWING
Eighty Per Cent of the Pop
ulation of Dharmsala Is
Killed by the Temblors
LONDON, April Câ A dispatch to a
news agency from Calcutta says Lady
Curzon (formerly Miss Letter of
"Washington and Chicago), wife of the
Viceroy of India, had a narrow escape
during the earthquake at Simla. A
massive chimney fell through the roof
and ceiling into the room above that
in which she was sleeping.
LAHORE, India, April 6.â Jt is re
ported here that 80 per cent of the in
habitants of Dharmsala, the hill sta
tion, ninety-five miles northwest of
Simla, were killed as a result of the re
cent earthquakes there. The Govern
ment haa dispatched from Isahore
tents, blankets, foods, doctors, nurses,
etc., for the sufferers at Dharmsala.
It is reported that the viceregal
lodge at Simla was damaged, as well
as the public offices.
The earthqpakes were severely felt
at Kasululi, but no lives were lost, and
the Pasteur Institute escaped.
A second shock at Simla on Tuesday
evening caused such a panic that the
residents rushed from their houses and
slept all night in the open.

STONEY OPENS ARGUMENT â¢
FN THE WILJDEY CASE
Limits Comment on Motion for New
Trial to Eriden.ee Already
Given.
Donzel Btoney opened his argument
yesterday morning before Judge
Troutt on behalf of the motion of TV.
K. Springer for a rehearing of the
case by which Mrs. Louisa M. Muir
head was awarded the estate of the
late CharlesJWalter Willey. So far
Storiey hae made no effort to prove the
existence of new evidence that would
tend to upset the verdict of the jury
that gave Mrs. Mulrhead the estate of
young Willey, confining his argument
to an analysis of the testimony given
by Mrs. Muirhead at the trial, a thing
that was done once by him before dur
ing the hearing of the contest, when
the Jury decided against his client.
Stoney, however, presented two af
fidavits, In which Daniel E. Mooney
and W. K. Springer aver that at the
time of the submission of the will con
test to the Jury on November 29, 1899,
the jury was" not kept together all of
the time, but that three of them were
taken out somewhere by the ballff
and later two of the jurors absented
themselves from the main body. This,
it Is alleged, occurred several years
ago, but the record of the case does
not phow that any protest was lodged
against the alleged separation of the
jury at the time, though Mooney In
his affidavit says he informed Stoney
of the incident at the time.
Judge C. W. Slack will argue the
motion on behalf of Mrs. Mulrhead
to-day and It is probable that It will
be submitted for decision without fur
ther delay.

STATE PROBABLE LOSER
Difficulty Confronts Collec
tion of $50,000 Under
the Inheritance Tax Law
Charles S. Wheeler, attorney for
James Dunsmulr, brother and sole
devisee of the late Alexander Duns
mulr, and Thomas W. Hickey, repre
sentative of Publlo Administrator
Hynes, engaged in argument in Judge
Coffey's court yesterday In a manner
that Indicates the warmth that will
surround the oontest to come over the
estate. It la also evident from develop
ments yesterday that the State will
have much difficulty In collecting the
$60,000 Inheritance tax It was believed
would flow In from the Dunsmuir es
tate.
Hynes' petition tor special letters of
administration was up for hearing.
Wheeler opposed the petition on the
ground that there was no need of a
special administrator, for, he said* the
funds and securities of the estate, of a
probable value of $750,000, were not In
California, but In British Columbia.
Hickey said it was hardly a proper
ground for counsel to contest an appli
cation for letters when it was evident
to him that James Dunamuir. had
caused the removal of the securities to
foreign 801 l for the purpose of removing
them from the Jurisdiction of the
courts of California. He said he be
lieved thÂ« court should order that the
securities be returned forthwith, that
the respondent might be deprived of an
opportunity to plead an unlawful act in
defense of a legal petition. If the se
curities are allowed to remain In Vic
toria the Dunsmuir coal bunkers, val
ued at $160,000, will be the only prop
erty of the deceased in the State.
Mr. Wheeler said he did not wish to
go into any lengthy discussion of the
affair, as he had an engagement to en
tertain Dr. Van Dyke of Princeton,
whose lectures at Berkeley have been
so favorably commented upon. This
satisfied Judge Coffey and a continu
ance for two weeks was ordered. In the
meantime Mr. Wheeler will entertain
Dr. Van Dyke at his summer home on
the McCloud River.
Judge Coffey having been informed
of the death of Josephine Dunsmuir, one
of the heirs of Alexander Dunsmuir,
made an order substituting W. S.
Leake, administrator of her estate, in
her place In the action pending before
him looking to the contest of Duns
mulr's will by Edna Wallace Hopper,
stepdaughter of Alexander Dunsmuir.

to return the wine to the manufactur
ers, but should they fall to do so the

the complainant said anything thafc

cative of the blow administered to his
Jaw his memory balked at it. However,
he would not urge conviction of the
defendant, who had spent one night in
durance.
"Your magnanimity relieves the court
from an embarrassing position," quoth
his Honor, "for there are folk who
might opine that it would be cruel to
inflict further punishment on a man
who had already been subjected to a

Harry Hlndricks. a restaurant cook
who was charged with having assault
ed his employer, appeared In Judge
Conlan's court with his head swathed
in bandages, and stated he had been
battered with a heavy scantling in the
hands of the complainant. Then it
was discovered that no formal com
plaint had been filed, and the Judge
discharged Mr. Hlndricks after advis
ing him "to get a warrant issued for
his assailant's arrest on the charge of
battery. Mr. Hindricks did not prom
ise to adopt the suggestion.
â vThen he was detected in the act of
robbing a general merchandise store
at 763 Howard street early yesterday
mornine. George E. Thompson fled to
the roof, carrying with him a select
inent of plunder. Including
watches, finger rings and other ar
ticles of jewelry. Patrolmen Cullinan
and Desmond gave chase, and as Mr.
Thompson endeavored to elude them he
dropped the stolen goods Into various
chimneys. At letr.t the policemen be
lieve that Is what he did with his loot,
for when they captured him on Mary
street not a trace of it could they find
or his person, nor did any of it mark
his trail.
In the court of Judge Mogan, where
he wae arraigned for burglary, Mr.
Thompson sullenly declined to plead,
and his case was continued till next
Tuesday in order to allow the officers
time in which to visit the domiciles on
the line of pursuit and ascertain if
any r,f the missing plunder has been
found by inmates thereof.
The Judge remarked that some
housewives must have thought Santa
Claua had erred in hie reckoning when
they found articles of value strewn
upon their hearths.

V.'hen the case of 'Ziek" Abrams and
ten others, charged with violating the
anti-pool ordinance, was called in
Judge Mogan's court, his Honor opined
that District Attorney Byington ought
to personally conduct the prosecution.
Then the charge against Abrams was
changed from that of conducting a
pool place to that of being an inmate
of a pcol place, and the cases were
continued till to-day.
Joe Peters confessed to possession of

FRANK SHOWS TEMPER
Manifests Displeasure When
Judge Orders Him to Pay
His Wife $1000 at Once
Rita A. Barron, a member of the
prominent Arguello family, has for
given her husband, George H. Barron,
from whom she procurred a divorce
a little less than a year ago, and yes
terday she signed a petition in the Su
perior Court asking that the interloc
utory decree of divorce granted her be
set aside. Her husband, she said, made
no answer to the suit and it was upon
her testimony and that of Louise Ar
guello that the decree was granted.
She said there is no legal reason why
: the decree should not be vacated and
she asked that it be done and the re
lationship between her and George H.
Barron re-estabiished. Her prayer was
granted by Judge Graham.
Andrew Frank, who is said to have
$20,000 in the bank, waxed angry in
Judge Hebbard's court yesterday when
ordered to pay his wife, Katherina
Frank, a lump sum of $1000 for main
tenance. Mrs. Frank testified that
notwithstanding her husband's wealth
he refused to maintain her and the
Judgment of the court was the result.
Frank protested to his attorney that
his examination had been rushed
through too quickly, or he would have
been able to convince the court that
he was right in the controversy. His
attorney made no reply, except to tell
him that the court had ruled and that
the court must be obeyed.
Decrees of divorce wore granted yes
terday to Lucille Robinson from George
H. Robinson for desertion; Agnes
Pierce from Stephen Pierce for cruelty;
Bertha Reed from Louis Reed for ex
treme cruelty and Clarence T. Arper
from Lorena E. Arper for willful de
sertion.
Judge Hebbard has adjudged Forest
I>ale Lowry guilty of contempt of court
and ordered him committed to Jail un

Lowry alimony in the sum of $172.
Lowry is in Los Angeles.
Annabella Ellis has sued John Ellis
for divorce, alleging cruelty. Jennie
Miiler asks for a divorce from John J.

tains not a word that could reasonably
be construed to prohibit the destruc
tion of garbage by fire or other means.
So the case of Scrafflno was dismissed.,
and in defense of Carlo's tender of
coin to the policeman it was argued
that he (Carlo) did not intend to
bribe, but in his ignorance of thÂ«:
law and its usage thought that th';
officer was authorized to accept th j
$2 50 fine which is usually imposed
for depositing garbage. The police
man, however, insisted that bribery
and subsequent exposure thereof wn
Intended by Carlo, that the coins of
fered were marked, and that a deep
seated conspiracy exists among the
"dagoes" of that neighborhood to
"do up" any policeman who compels
them to respect the municipal ordi
nances. But as no proof of conspir
acy was produced, the court dismissed
Carlo, too.
Mary Rino, widow, aged 69. tol<l
Judge Fritz that she could not ac
count for the strange infatuation that
possessed her the moment she set
eyes upon Charles Stewart, aged 23.
All she knew about it was that no
sooner did she see Charles, as ho
walked along Howard street last Wed
nesday evening, than she became
seized with irresistible impulse to em
brace him. She had felt the tender
passion before, for thrice had she
been led to the altar and as often
had she followed the remains of an
esteemed consort to the tomb, but
never had she been so utterly unable
to dissemble her affection as when
she met Charles. It was the first
time she had fallen in love at first
sight, and, considering her age and
experience, it seemed most extraor
dinary.
Charles remained mute before the
bench, but Patrolman Cameron tes
tified that in his opinion both the old
woman and the young man were in
toxicated by something else than love
when he broke them away from each
other. The female was most ardent
in her attachment, the policeman add
ed, Charles apparently being too far
gone in inebriety to realize what he
was doing. Indeed, he seemed to be
feebly repulsing the advances of hia
ancient wooer.
The court, however, adjudged both
defendants equally guilty of disturb
ing the peace and deferred sentence
till next Monday, when some more
facts about the Woman's past may be
disclosed.
"To send me to jail," said Miss
Lillian Colburn, accused of caresstng
on the public thoroughfare a man
she had never seen before, "would be
cruel, for this is my twenty-fourth
birthday."
"Very unfortunate," said Judge
Mogan, "but I cannot let you go un
til the truth or falsity of the story
you have Just told has been proven."
She claimed to be an actress. A
native of Canada, she said, she met
one J. Edmund King, a theatrical
agent. In Montreal about eight years
ago, and after marrying her he put
her on the stage, where she made
quite a hit as a dancing and singing
soubrette. They came westward,
playing highly successful engagement*
In Chicago and other cities ere they
arrived in California. Here she was
beaten and abandoned by her hus
band, and since then she has ap
peared In various cheap vaudeville
theaters in Oakland, and also made a
road tour with the "Seven Bells" com
pany. Her mother, she alleges, Is Mrs.
Mary Duffy, residing at 134 Jessie
street, who has been subpenaed to ap
pear to-day and testify.
PHELAN ENTERS
TO MIXED TUNE
Amusins: Incidents of Cele
bration Over New Mis
sion Park Acquisition
JANITOKSPEEFORMDUTY
Cheer Mayor Schmitz Lusti
ly, as Per Contract, When
He Appears in the Hall
The recent park celebration at the j
Mission was enlivened by several
amusing incidents. When the citizens
of the Mission district resolved to cele
brate the acquisition of the park the
question of invitations to the celebra
tion came up for discussion. When the
list was made out and submitted by
the committee it was noted that Mayor
Schmitz was not among those invited.
A prominent office holder of Republi
can faith called the committee's atten
tion to what he supposed was an over
sight. He was informed at once that
the Mayor's name was left off the list
after due deliberation, as the citizens
who had planned the demonstration
were determined that the meeting
should not be used to advance the po
litical fortunes of the ochmitz follow
ing. The Republican office holder
placed the subject before the commit
tee in another light. Ke contended that
the committee would fail In courtesy
and good common sense If it ignored
the Mayor of San Francisco for any
reason whatever. After renewal of the
discussion it was decided^hat the May
or's name should be placed on the list.
It is suspected that the Mayor got
a hint of the discussion before the final
decision was announced, because as
soon as he received notice of his invl
taticn to be present he sent word along
the line advising that a strong force of
janitors and other attaches of the mu
nicipal government should be in the
hall to "whoop" and demonstrate when
the Mayor made his advent.
JANITORS FURNISH NOISE.
The janitors arrived early and made
noise good and plenty when the Mayor
took his seat on the platform. The
Mayor himself was so delighted with
the demonstration that he could not
resist the desire to express his pleas
ure. Accordingly he leaned over and
whispered to a memberof the commit
tee: "This reception is an answer U
the vile attacks of the press." The
committeeman who knew that thy
janitors had been staked out in the au
dience to create the demonstration ha":
a good laugh in his sleeve.
It goes without saying that a band of
good standing with the Musician?'
Union was engaged by the citizens of
the Mission to discourse music for th^
event. Following the usual custom
the committee told the leader of tht
band when to begin playing. Th
leader was also told to keep a lookou;
for ex-Mayor Phelan. The committo
said: "Mr. Phelan will come in witr
Frank J. Sullivan and others. Wher
he comes the band must strike up 'He';
a Jolly Good Fellow.' " Several of tht
musicians remonstrated. One of tnt
knockers had the audacity to exclaim: ,
"He is not a jolly good fellow." The
remark exasperated the committee of
management and some high words
were exchanged. The musicians de- !
clared that they would not hail Phelan
with that air. The committee replied
that the taxpayers of the Mission and
not the members of the Musicians'
Union were entitled to decide whether
Mr. Phelan was or was not a jolly good â¢
fellow. More than that was said to the
musicians. They were told that they
had been hired to play for the people
of the Mission and were bound to play
the tunes that the committee wanted
them to play.
MUSIC VARIEGATED.
The engagement was on the verge of
cancellation when the musicians con
sented to play the old-time rollicking
tunes in honor of the arrival of the
Phelan-Sullivan party. The way the
promise was kept created a deal of
merriment. Everybody in the band
played to suit his own views. It was
hard to tell whether the band was
playing "HsVs a Jolly Good Fellow,"
or another popular air, "We Are Up
Against the Real Thing Now." Ap
plause, however, equal In volume and
spontaneity to that which delighted
Schmitz heralded the approach of Phe
lan.
The people of the Mission district
expect that the Supervisors will allow
$25,000 for initial work on the new park,
as the Board of Park Commissioners
has asked for an appropriation of that
sum. The Mayor, having been invited
to the celebration, will certainly feel
constrained to stand in for the park
allowance. The Phelan-Sullivan Influ
ence, despite the attitude of the musi
cians, will surely be cast in favor of a
liberal allowance for the Mission Park.
When the money is voted the people of
the Mission may elect to hold another
celebration.
Sues Board of Works.
Holbrook. Merrill & Stetson filed
ault yesterday to restrain the Board of
Public Works from tearing up a spur
track erected by the plaintiff firm on
j the north side of Townsend street, near
, Sixth. The firm quotes the ordinance
of the Board of Supervisors granting
It the right to construct the track and
says the Board of Works threatens to
tear It up and will carry its threat irf
to execution unless restrained by the
i court.

DAIRY BUREAU
MAPS CAMPAIGN
The trustees of the State Dairy Bu
reau decided yesterday to enter at once
on an active campaign to carry out the
provisions of the laws that were enact
ed by the Legislature at its recent ses
sion affecting dairies and the products
of dairies. J. M. Thomas, the secretary,
having resigned, W. H. Saylor -was
elected secretary of the bureau, and to
him as an executive officer will largely
be intrusted the work that Is to be per
formed.
Some of this work is likely to attract
attention. The Legislature's acts em
brace a wide scope in their conse
quence. One of the new laws provides
for an inspection of all the dairies of
the State by the dairy bureau- To the
bureau will fall the task of seeing that
the dairies are kept clean. Another
law confides to the dairy bureau the
task of seeing that all butter packages
sold in California shall be up to the
weight that is marked upon them, and
penalties are provided for any short
weight offending.
There Is also a new law that provides
for the testing of creamery apparatus.
Hereafter also manufacturers and deal
ers in renovated butter must take out
licenses to do business. The law about
the creamery apparatus is supposed to
guarantee accurate tests of the quality
of milk and cream at the creameries.
All renovated butter must hereafter be
branded as renovated. To call it "pro
cess" butter when it is offered for sale
is an offense against the law. All these
matters were talked over preliminary
to the actual beginning of work. John
A. Bliss was elected president of the
board of trustees.
Accused of Stealing Watch.
Herman Borchert, a guest at the
International Hotel, fell asleep in a
saloon at 904 Kearny street early yes
terday morninir. He was awakened
by some one going through his pock
ets. He missed his gold watch and
chain and, seeing a man running out
of the saloon, he gave chase. He was
Joined by Policeman Nelson and Spe
cial Officer Daggett and they soon
overtook the fugitive. He gave the
name of Edward Jackson. The police
believe he had an accomplice. The
watch w-as recovered at Jackson street
and Montgomery avenue, where Jack
son Is suposed to have dropped It.
Accuses Cogliill in Turn.
G. A. Kahn has filed a denial to the
allegations of his partner. T. B. Cog
hill, that he has falsified the books of
the firm ajid defrauded Coghlll out of
$30,000. As a matter of fact Coghill,
alleges Kahn, is trying to make a se
lection of his division of the assets of
the firm and endeavoring to force
him (Kahn) to take worthless notes
and other papers of doubtful value
and apply them to his division of the
assets. In conclusion Kahn asks that
the court restrain Coghill from hand
ling any of the funds or assets of the
firm until an accounting can be had.
CIGAR DEALERS
LOSE THE FIGHT
Judge Seawell has unfettered the
police to do as they will with cigar
dealers or apy other persons that vio
late the anti-poolselling ordinance.
Yesterday morning he dissolved the
preliminary injunction restraining the
officers from blockading certain
premises. The preliminary Injunction
was issued upon complaint of A. B.
Broyer, 105 O'Farrell street; Fried
man Brothers, 129 O'Farrell street.
Goslinger & Wilson. 131 O'Farrell
street; Louis Bernhard. 114 O'Farrell
street; Zick Abrams, 101 Ellis street;
Philip I>avis, 12 Leidesdorff street,
and Albert Baer. 11l Bush street. Of
the number Abrams was the only one
that ran an out-and-out poolroom,
the others dovetailing the betting
work in among sales of cigars and to
bacco.
In miking his ruling against the
pooloollers Judge Seawell simply said
that the petition of the plaintiffs that
a permanent injunction be granted
them was denied and that the pre
liminary injunction heretofore en
tered would be dissolved. He said It
was not necessary for him to file an
opinion, as his views had been fully
expressed during the hearing of the
petition of the plaintiffs. During thÂ«
trial of the case Judge Seawell said:
-So far as â  the court can dctertnln* It utnu
to mÂ« . that ' there has â  been no Interference
with the â  actual : cigar business - done by tlie>9
plaintiffs the policeman whoM . presence It :la

trial It turns out that the transactions which
the police were set to watch were made m
rooms apart from the cigar stores. No ex

plaintiffs of what these rooms have been osed
for. In fact their existence haa not even been
mentioned.
Applications of this kind should be accom

court may be informed of what it Is enacted .

Bacon â¢ Sells ,: for i More in

Special Dispatch to The Call.
AMITY. Colo., April 6.â H. Rider
Haggard, who is here as an envoy of
the British Government, conducting an
inspection of the Salvation Army col
onies in Ameri- said to-day:
"I see nothing except revolution and
ruin in this country if you do not curb
your gigantic trusts. Prices have been
elevated to the prohibitive point for
all except the very rich and this will
cause trouble unless a remedy Is quick
ly and thoroughly applied.
"Why, the bacon we t in Amity
costs more in Colorado, where it is
made, than it does in England.
"I believe the colonization of city
people on large tracts of land will
solve the problem of high prices.
"The poor people who live in your
big cities and those of Colorado get
what we consider in-England a good
wage, but the cost orliving is so high
here that they have no conveniences,
comfort or money. The poorer classes
of people in England do not make as
much money as in this country, but
they live better."
DEATH FOLLOWS
THE HONEYMOON
Special Dispatch to The CÂ»JL
SELMA, April 6â Z. T. Tracy, wedded
two weeks ago to-day, was buried this
afternoon. He was the victim of a
runaway accident, which resulted in
his death last evening.
Tracy, who was a well-known ranch
er, was returning home yesterday
morning. It was the thirteenth day of
his honeymoon and as he and his bride
were driving along a quiet lane their
Horse became frightened and ran off.
Both Tracy and his wife were thrown
from the buggy. Tracy's injuries were
internal and he died within a few
hours. Mrs. Tracy was badly injured
on the head, but will recover.
The funeral services were conducted
by the same minister, at the same hour
and time and in the same church as
the wedding ceremony, which had been
performed but two weeks earlier.
FATIGUE CURED
BY ANTITOXIN
Special DiÂ»Datc'h t3 The Call.
NEW YORK, April 6.â That a man
may never be tired again if he has the
price of fatigue a itoxin is the de
, duction of a German scientist. But
j more remarkable perhaps is the fact
| that a number of the foremost medical
j men of New York agree that the an
nihilation of fatigue by serum has an
â  actual basis of scientific truth.
In the Muenchener Medicinische
I Wocherblatt, a recognized medical
j journal, De Wolfgang Weichardt de
i scribes his experiments in creating an
J antitoxin to the poison c-f fatigue or
; exhaustion. He drew a guinea pig by
a string across a rough carpet until it
gave up resistance and became totally
' exhausted. The toxin, a poison, was
j obtained from the exhausted animal
and inoculated into others. It was
injected into a human subject with a
very perceptible gain in Jjis strength.

LONDON, April 6. â A serious hitch
in the agreement recently signed be
tw en British and German bondhold
ers and the Venezuelan Government
threatens to render the scheme for the
satisfaction of the former's claims
unworkable. A clause in the contract
provides that the proportion of the

shall be paid to the British legation
and consular officials in Venezuela,
but the British Government refuses to
consent. The bondholders are discuss
ing an alternative arrangement, but
considerable doubt exists that the con
tract will be carried out.

BODY OF A MAN FOUND
ON THE BANK OF A SLOUGH
STOCKTON, April 6.â The body of a
man supposed to be Richard Vintini
'was found this evening on the north
bank of a small slough just outside of
the City limits, near the northeastern
part of the city, with a bullet-hole
through the heart. A revolver lay
alongside the remains. The fact that
it was full cocked and the arm
stretched to the widest point has caused
some doubt as to whether the case is a
suicide. A bankbook showing a bait
ance of $715 contained Vintini's name,
but none of the local Italians has been
able to identify the body. The remains
were not robbed.

VICTIM OF THE MYSTERIOUS MURDER
SAID TO BE HARRY UNA, A PEDDLER
The murdered man is believed to be Harry Una, i
peddler. He was identified last nigfct by Henry
Heinz, a ieam<ter. Whon Heinz saw the bead which
"as found on the beach near Meiggs wharf la>t
night he was at first somewhat dubious about the
identiticat ion. but later became convinced that he
had made no mistake. T'na has been missing since
TYerinesdny. Dr. Bacigaltipi declares that the man
struck from behind while eating.
Ghastly Discovery Made by
Two Small Boys.
HEAD AND LIMBS ARE FOUND
Bundle Found Among Rocks
Near Meiggs Wharf.
IS CAST UP FROM THE WATERS
Two little boye who were crab-fishing i
near Meiggs Wharf made the ghastly
discovery cf - bead and limbs of the
murdered man. While they were frol
lc&irLg aior.g the water's edge one of
item, Raymond Lanteri. saw what ap
peared to be a sack wedged tn among
the rocks.
It excited hie boyish curiosity and
b* oalied his companion and brother,
by adoption. Jose, to help inspect it.
Other boys of the same age who
were with them crowded around the
.bundle. "May be it's something <we
can sell." suggested Raymond.
He r -.ea the sack and started back
with a siriek of terror The other lit
tle feliowe, none of whom are over 12.
turned away and ran. A hacked hu
mar. limb protruded from the bag.
Fo: some time little Raymond was
rooted to the spot in terror. Then he,
too. turned ard ran away screaming.
Thomas Crowley. the boatman who
happened to be passing that way in his
buggy, was attracted by the screams
cf the youngsters, le dismounted and
walked to where the white-faced boys
pointed. One e-lance at the contents of
the sack convinced him that the head
and limbs of the man who had been
foully murdered the night before had
been found.
He carried the ghastly discovery to
his buggy and drove rapidly with it to
his boathouse, where he immediately
notified the police and the Morgue.
Coroner's Deputy Fennel immediately
responded, accompanied by Detective
Taylor.
They' emptied the ghastly contents
of the sack, while a morbid crowd gath
ered around the boathouee. The head
was thr : cf an Italian, between 20 and !
24 years of age. The hair and eyes
were dark and there was a slight dark
mustache.
GASHES IV SCALP.
There were two long gashes in the
â¢calp and cne of the eyes was closed
from the force of a blow. Otherwise
the head was perfectly preserved. De
tective Taylor remarked with satisfac
tion that there would be little difficulty
In identifying it "If any one dared to
do so."
Part of the unfortunate man's cloth
ing was used to wTap the severed mem
bers. The bead and arms were
wrapped in parts of a red flannel shirt
such as Is commonly worn by Italians.
The legs were wrapped in parts of a
cheap blue serge coat. The label on
the coat co-did be partly deciphered.
The word "Denver" was made out. but
the rest was Indistinct.
The ghastly remnants of the m?n
were crammed carelessly into the sack.
The bundle had been flung into the bay
between the bÂ«ach and the break
water. It had probably drifted in, as
it was not weighted nor had any at
tempt been made to sink it.
Perhaps, like the man who bore the
bleeding trunk down Vallejo street, the
man who carried the head and limbs
became alarmed and hastily cast his
ioad into the i water. It now seems a
certainty that the crime was not the
deed of one man.
There is another theory regarding the
place here the body was found. Some
of the detectives believe that it was
placed in this spot as a warning to
the Italians of the quarter â a gbastly
â aarning of the Mafia's power.
The murdered man was of slight
build and rather short. It was fnund,
when the limbs were placed beside the
:rank. There is â¢.tie doubt that he
vas an Italian. There â vere no tattoo i
:iiarks or scars upon the members.
T^he head and limbs had been hacked 'â¢
'â fti in a savage "frenzy. He had been \
:eiled to the lOOT by blows with axes
â t rir rivers and then hacked to pieces.
KXIFE IX JUGULAR.
I: was lliillliljT the work of more
tfcsn two men, for besides the lacera- '
tions th^rc- are indications that a knife
vms thrust into his jugular vein.
H3;-mrad Lanteri. the boy who first
szw the sack, if- â  mulatto and the ;
adopted child of P. Lanteri, a saloon- i
'J'c-per at 3i Broadway. With .Llnv was I
Lanterrar 10-year-old son, Jose.
Raymond gives the following account
of his discovery:
**WÂ« were playing along thÂ« * beach.
I saw the sack and thought there might
be something in it worth money. So
I ran over to it and the other fellows
all said 'Divvy:
"When I opened it a bloody end Qt an
arm stuck out. Gee, I wae scared. I
almost died right there. I never want
to see anything like it again. The
sack wÂ«w tn the rocks on the beach. It
was thrown between the breakwater
and the beach."
Lanteri and his wife seemed greatly
concerned when they learned that the
children had made the discovery. When
the boys did not return at the dinner
hour the couple became greatly
alarmed.
"If any of those people have harmed
my boy," declared Lanteri, "I will get
a pistol and shoot everybody I think
had a hand in it. He waved his
clenched fist in the direction of the
L*tin quarter.
But the boys returned safely and,
I boylike. rather triumphant over their
; discovery, until they were, asked to re
1 count how they found It. Then the
small mulatto 6hook with terror. He
could see the hacked end of the human
arm again before his eyes.
The head lies at the Morgue, where
hundreds of people are viewing it, some
out of morbid curiosity, others, mostly
Italians, for reasons that they keep
to themselves.
SEVERAL THEORIES.
One of the theories entertained by
the police that the murdered man was
slaughtered by members of the Mafia
for testimony given in the Giuiseppi
Brogardo murder case has come to
naught. All of the witnesses in that
case have been located by Detective
Tom Gibson. Rosario Domino of 429
Bay street was not found at home, but
his relatives appeared at the Morgue
last night and declared that he was
not the murdered man. Domino has
been in fear of vengeance at the hands
of the Mafia and recently applied at
the Hall of Justice for a permit to
carry a revolver, fearing his life was
in danger. It is understood that he
is on a fishing trip and will not return
for several days. With all of the
witnesses for the State accounted for,
this theory of the detectives falls and
new clews will have to be unearthed.
From dawn until dusk a score of
detectives scoured the North Beach
district seeking for some definite clew
that would lead to the detection of
the fiends responsible for the atro
cious crime. Every foot of pavement
was thoroughly inspected for blood
stains indicative of the trail of the
murderer. Nothing of Importance
was discovered until Detectives Taylor
and Coe found a number of blood
spots at the junction of Powell and
Union streets. Several more blood
ppots were found at the entrance to
Washington square, but here the trail
ended.
I'ndaunted, the detectives continued
to explore the neighborhood, and suc
cess rewarded their' efforts. At Stock
ton and Union streets a well denned
trail was again found. This led up
the easterly side of Stockton street
to Filbert and east on that thorough
fare to a point opposite No. 524. A
careful search of this house was made
without success. The occupants of the
premises were found to be of eminent
respectability and they could throw
no light on the tragedy. An alleyway
runs alongside of the building to a
small courtyard In the rear. A num
ber of families whose residences face
on this court were of the unanimous
opinion that no unusual noises were
heard during the night. A large
watchdog guards the portals of one of
the residences, but nothing of a sus
picious nature aroused him.
Detective Taylor late In the after
noon found several traces of blood at
the corner .of Green and Powell
streets. Taylor was unable to pick
up a trail from this point farther than
half a block wpst on Green street.
It was discovered later by Policeman
Bakulich that the Filbert-street trail
of blood was caused by a woman suf
fering from eplstaxis, which to people
who do not speak as many languages
as Officer Bakulich is merely nose
bleed. She was seeking a drug store.
SAN FRANCISCO, FRIDAY, APRIL 7, 1905.
TWO BROTHERS WHO FOUND THE HEAD ANT> LIMBP AT MEIGOS WHARF,
THE MEN WHO SAW MURDKRER AND PATROLMAN WHO OPENED
BUNDLE AND MADE THE AWFUL DISCOVERT
BLOODHOUNDS ARE
OF LITTLE USE.
Dogs Are Put on Scent of the Murderer, but
Lose Trail After Short Chase.
Bloodhounds gave their aid to the
Police Department yesterday morning
In the search for the butcher who had
done his fiendish work in the vicinity of
Russian Hill. Three of the soft-eyed
animals whose mournful bay has been
the cry of doom for many a cowering
felon, darted about on Vallejo and
Mason streets, sniffing for odors that
would lead them to the quarry. The
hounds were set to their task at 8
o'clock at tWe steps of the Bellevue
House, Powell and Vallejo streets,
where the bundle containing the dis
membered human body had been de
posited the night before by the ghoul
who had carried It from wherever the
foul murder had been committed. It
was the first time bloodhounds had
ever been used In San Francisco, and
the streets were packed with a morbid
throng of people curious to # see what
they would do.
The hounds proved of no usÂ°. They
covered some ground on the general
trail that the man who carried the
remains had taken, but it soon became
evident that their employment would
lead to no olew and they werÂ« taken
away.
The dogs took up the blood scent
readily and quickly led the officers to
a stable and blacksmith shop owned
by V. Canton at 1807 Vallejo street.
After sniffing around for several mo
ments, the animals paused amid some
blocks of wood, on one of which were
stains that resembled blood, but were
not known to be such.
An announcement was made that
the dogs had scented blood in the
stable and wild excitement prevailed.
More than 3000 persons were gathered
in the vicinity of where the mutilated
remains had been discovered the night
before, and the police were unable to
cope with the surging mass when the
news that the dogs were on the trail
had been spread broadcast.
It was with some difficulty that the
animals were started from the stable,
but when they took the scent again,
they proceeded without delay across
the street. When within a few feet
oÂ£ the corner of Mason street the dogs
paused again and sniffed around the
curb.
From this point the three blood
hounds led the posse to the entrance

MARKS ON VICTIM'S SKULL INDICATE
HE WAS STRUCK DOWN FROM BEHIND
BY GANG OF COWARDL Y ASSASSINS
Evidence Found by Autopsy Surgeon Proves He
Was Killed While Eating Supper.
APPARENTLY THE WORK OF MURDEROUS GANG
The head and limbs of the man
whose bleeding trunk was found near
the corner of Vallejo and Powell streets
Wednesday night were found in a sack
on the beach near Melggs wharf yes
terday afternoon by two little boys.
The police now know that they have
to deal with a band of assassins and
not one fiend, as at first supposed.
While one man bore the trunk down
ValleJo street, a fellow conspirator stole
through the shadows down Mason
street to the water side, where he cast
the bundle into the sea.
From a partial autopsy made yester
day Autopsy Surgeon Bacigalupi be
lieves that the man was murdered while
eating. Portions of bananas and spa
ghetti were found in the stomach, and
a bit of the fruit in the aesophagus.
There wera three incisions made in
the neck with a knife or knives. Three
gaping wounds were made in the skull
with an ax or cleaver. It is believed
that the man was struck down from
behind as he raised a morsel of food to
his lips, and that then the crowd of as
sassins sprang upon him and hacked
him to pieces.
"Mafia" is the rumor on every tongue.
"Mafia," is the conviction of the police.
Of the thousands who gazed on the
pitiful remnants of what once was a
human being, not one knew him.
though his features were little marred.
Or if any who gazed into the fixed
features recognized them, they kept
their secret.
The only mark of identification found
ap yet is on a coat, part of which was
used to wrap the head before it was
thrust into the sack. It was a label,
almost undecipherable. All that could
be made out was the word "Denver."
Pages 11 to 20
The other remains of the unfortunate I
man were packed in a part of the t
coat and bits of a faded red flannel
shirt, such as Italian fishermen wear.
Detective Tom Gibson, "ho was on
the Brogardo murder case, supposed to
be the work of the Mafia, is following
this clew. The shirt. fhÂ» cord that was
fastf-ned around the trunk and the deft
method In whKh it was tied, would
seem to indicate that the murderers
were fishermen.
Detectives arÂ» scouring the route
that must have been taken by the man
who carried the head and limbs. The
district through which he passed 'is a
crowded one, and the police are confi
dent that he could not have reached
the bay that way without being ob- |
served.
The men detailed by the assassin
band must have left the scene of the
butchery at Â»he same time. One was
detected and had to drop his drippy
burden. The other, who carried the
smaller bundle, succeeded in carrying
out the command of the chief of the
assassins.
The victim was a man small in stat
ure and unmistakably an Italian. He
was between 20 and 24 years old. He
wore a slight mustache.
As to whpre the crime was commit
ted the police are still at sea. They
feel sure the butchery took place within
a radius ef^three blocks of whore oliva
first saw the man who carried the
trunk. But search of the neighbor
hood revealed nothing but a few blood
sp.-^ts al<>ng the route taken by the
murderer.
Yet within a stone's throw of where
the bleeding, quivering trunk was
I found, the man was hacked to pieces
Iby a gang of assassins. Nobody heard
his dying shrieks, if he uttered any:
I nobody heard any unnatural noises iÂ«
the neighborhood during the night.
These facts seem strange. The In
habitants of that section se<*m to thÂ«
police to have adopted the same policy
as the Orientalâ to evadÂ» investiga
tions.
A novel but unsneeessfu! effort waÂ«
mad* in the moxnin* to trace back to
the lair of the assassins the traH mi thÂ«
man who bore the trunk to the Belle

cured and given the scent from thÂ«
'> bloody blanket and shawl. The ani-
m als seemed to have 3truck a trail,
but lost it near 1810 Ma3on street.
where two drops of blood had fallen
, from the ghastly burden.
Nearly every detective in the depart

DETECTIVES USE BLOODHOUNDS IN A FUTILE ENDEAVOR TO TRACE THE MURDERER
CROWD GATHERS
AT THE MORGUE
TO VIEW BODY
Several Thousand Curious Persons
'See Remains at City's
Dead House.
Morbid Throng Passes To and Fro
to Get a Glimpse of the
Ghastly Sight
Soi since the night that the body of i
Minnie 'Williams was laid out on a slab I
at the Morgue has the city charnel- j
house presented such a spectacle as It :
did last night. From the time the
limbs and head of the murdered man j
wÂ«re brought in from Meiggs wharf
till past 10 o'clock thousands of curious
men, women and children thronged the
chamber of death, each eager to catch
a glimpse of the mutilated remains.
A squad of officers was on duty at
the entrance to the chamber and it
â was with difficulty that they man
aged to keep the mob in order. Among
the curious sightseers could be dis
cerned the anxious faces, of mothers,
lathers and sisters, who journeyed to
the place with fear In their hearts
lest the corpse might be that of one
of their loved ones. â¦
Several persons viewed intently the
grewsome remains and Imagined for a i
moment that they recognized in the
heap of flesh and bones the features
of a friend or relative. But all efforts I
to identification failed utterly, for when j
It came to a test there was no one j
among the thousands who visited the I
Morgue who could positively state that
he or she knew the dead man.
The head and limbs arrived at the
chamber of death shortly after 6
o'clock. The news that they had been I
.found spread like wildfire and it took j
but a few moments to attract thou
sands to the place. It was with the !
greatest difficulty that the Morgue dep- j
uties managed to carry the remains to |
the slab and arrange them' about the
trunk, that the crowd might view what j
had the nearest semblance to the com
pact body. HL3B
CHIXESE ARE CURIOUS.
Among the motley . throng that
fought for a glimpse at the remains
were a number of Chinese men and
women. They seemed to be strangely
interested in the proceedings for some
reason or another and chattered and i
jabbered among themselves while wait- j
ing at the door for a chance to pass in. i
When it was announced that the !
dead man was unqueetionably an Ital- j
ian the news seemed to take firm ;
root in the Latin quarter and for that j
reason there were more Italians than j
eny other nationality to visit the j
â¢ deathhouse last night. It was hoped
that from among the hundreds of this
race on the scene the remains Vould
be identified, but no such good fortune
was in store for the authorities.
* Among the first to view the remains
was James Beatty, a soldier from the
Presidio. Beatty was struck speech
less by the sight of the dead man and j
stated that he had seen him on the |
6treet only a few days ago. He added j
that the face of the corpse was very j
familiar to him, as he had seen it on
the street time and time again, but
had no idea who the man was.
"I have seen that face on the
streets countless times," 6aid Beatty.
"I have been living at the Tremont j
House on Kearny street for some
weeks and spend a great deal of time
in this part of the city. I never for
get a face when I take notice of it. I
am not making a mistake, for those
features are too clear and distinct."
An Italian laborer called at the
Morgue at a late hour and after tak
ing a look at the grewsome remains
eaid he thought they were those of G.
Gevincinzo. After being questioned
by the Morgue deputies the man ad- j
, mitted he was mistaken, as his friend
wae older than the man on the slab
and had more prominent features.
RWAS A WORKIXGMAX.
The dead man was unquestionably
a hard working Individual, and, from
the appearance of his hands, it would
seem that he had worked as a ma
chinist or at some other similar trade.
The hands are large and rough and
bear many scars, which would . mdl- j
cate that he had much to do with
machinery or heavy tools.
Many women who were of a timid
disposition and feared to enter the
death chamber rode in the elevator
and craned their necks for a chance
to get a g-limpse at the remains as
they rode up and down. But the
members of the fair ccx for the most
part were not afraid to enter the
room and, strange to say, they man
ifested far more interest in the.grew-
Eome sight than did the men who
; thronged the place.
Every now and then a little group
of swarthy men from Fishermans
wharf would file by the horror. They
. made no comments that any one could
hear, these men of the murdered
one's race.
, "Was he a fisherman?" was asked
some of them. A shrug of the shoul
ders and an undecided shake of ' the
head was the only reply received.
But as the i -.ermen stole away
they would whisper among them
selves, then look. about them fearful
ly, as though being watched. Fear of
the<power that directs the black hand
seemed to have mastered them.
During the afternoon Antone Fi
grone, a florist, viewed the limbless
body at the Morgue. After observing
it caref ully ' Figone told a policeman
who was keeping the crowd moving
&t the entrance of the Morgue that he
.feared he knew who the dead man
wae. He was taken before Captain
Burnett and said he was certain the
mutilated corpse was that of Nick
*Â»a*terene. a florist, who had not been
seen for some days. He told a tale
of a young man having trouble with
a girl and of the brothers of the girl
making threats against him. When
the head and limbs were found he
again returned to the Morgue and
viewed the body. He admitted that
he was wrong and the police dropped
this clew.
CROWDS ARE EAGER,

dark, dry bloodstains at the bottom
of the stairs leading to the entrance
of the Bellevue lodging-house.
The neighborhood swarmed with po
licemen, detectives, amateur detectives
and all sorts and conditions of people
eager for a new horror. Whenever a
rumor jvas raised that the head and
limbs had been found eager crowds
rushed where the report directed them.
At the Morgue they fought and
struggled and almost pleaded for a
chance to gaze on the hacked rem
nants of the poor creature that was
once a fellow-being.
Near the place where the bearer of
the death burden had started across
the street blood stains were found and
near the house at 1610 Mason street
were more blood stains. Two small
drops were found near the corner of
Vallejo and Powell streets.
Children, scarcely able to toddle,
tramped the neighborhood and went
about searching for blood stains, as
their little brothers and sister* in the
country hunted daisies afield. When
they located anything that looked like
gore they would call their playmates
and prattle childishly over the discov
ery. The desire to see more blood ap
peared to pervade all.
The crowd at the foot of the Bellevue
House stairway never thinned. There
were all Borts of characters congregat
ed there. The predominating race was
Latin, naturally.
Some of them were sinister-browed
men wearing earrings and who gazed
at the dark stains and turning away
muttered among themselves. At the
sound of the word "Mafia" the chat
tering Italians became silent and drew
aside among themselves.
But the children, who had heard the
talk at firesides, chattered "Mafia."
Swarthy faces that remained immobile
when they saw the dark stains,
twitched uneasily when the dread
name was uttered.
The crowd seemed to murmur
"Blood" and "Mafia."
Detectives were busy from early
dawn to midnight investigating the
houses in the vicinity. Fences were
scaled, cellars were searched and every
possible place within three blocks
where the deed could have been com
mitted was Inspected, but no clews
were gathered.
The hounds were closely followed by
a clamorous throng. The keen-scented
animals were no more eager to sniff
blood than the crowd was to see it-
Hundreds stared at the bloody blanket
and shawl that were used to give the
hounds the scent. The sight of these
ghastly relics only seemed to sharpen
their desire to see more.
The vacant houses on Mason Btreet,
near Vallejo, to which suspicion waÃ
directed on Wednesday night, were
searched from cellar to attic, but no
or.c had entered them for days. The
search of the neighborhood was fruit
less and the crowds' thirst for horrors
remained unsated.
TOM SULLIVAN DEFEATS
CLEVER YOUNG CHOYNSKI
Tom Sullivan won the so-called
amateur lightweight boxing cham
pionship from Young Choynskl last
night after a sensational four-round
bout at Woodward's Pavilion. Choyn
skl had a broken hand reset at the
Receiving Hospital after the fight.
This accident probably had some
bearing on the outcome.
Sullivan scored three knockdowns
in the first round with straight
rights. Choynski was groggy, but he
camte back with a right swing to Sul
livan's Jaw, which dazed him. Sulli
van recovered and outpointed his op
ponent.
Harry Tenny knocked out Barney
Driscoll in the third round of their
bout. Driscoll went down three times,
twice for the count of nine. The last
time he was, unable to respond.
Danny Murphy secured the decision
over Al Burns in four rounds; Jack
Conroy knocked out Jack Corrlgan In
one round. Jack Brown defeated Jim
Kane, Jack Rodney beat Young Otts,
and Gus Koster beat Bill Johnson.

of a vacant flat at 1610 Mason Btreet.
When the sate to the place was open
ed the animals dashed in and sniffed
around In an excited manner. In front
of this flat two bloodstains had been
found on the pavement. The bearer
of the dead had passed that way.
The dogs were led into the house,
but they failed to take up any scent
there. The poeae made a careful
search of the place, but nothing to
excite suspicion was discovered. The
rooms were bare and there was no
evidence that the house had been oo
cupied for many weeks. All efforts to
locate a clew here failed utterly.
From the Mason street house the
dogs followed the trail to a vacant fiat
at 726 Green street They halted at
the doorway and sniffed around at
some sand that was sprinkled there.
From here the animals proceeded next
door and after sniffing around for
some time, lost the trail completely
and led the officers back to the blaok
smith shop on Vallejo Btreet.
The animals sniffed around the
place for several minutes and were
loth to leave the scene. The police
learned from Canton, the proprietor,
that several Italian vegetable poddlers
house their horses and wagons there,
but he did not know their names.
The police kept up their search In
the neighborhood for several hours,
but discovered no deflnate clew. The
posse went from one house to the
other and made careful inquiries, with
the hope of gaining the name of some
one who might have been seen wan
dering about the neighborhood in a
suspicious manner the night before.
OLIVA GUIDES POLICE.
George H. Ollva, whom the police
expected would be of invaluable as
sistance in running the murderer to
earth, could not give them the assist
ance that was expected of him. The
ghastly spectacle he had witnessed or
the fear of being drawn into the mys
tery completely shattered the nerves
of the young man.
When the police balled at his home,
3% August alley, early yesterday morn
ing, their Intentions were to take the
youth and have him lead the detectives
over the same ground that he had fol
lowed the mysterious man over a few
hours before.
Ollva was in a nervous state from
the shock. Realizing that it would be
better to wait until the young man had
calmed himself, it was decided to have
him lead the detectives over the ground
in the afternoon.
Oliva's statements were misleading
in some particulars, and Captain of
Detectives Burnett was at first not
Inclined to give them full credence.
Subsequent corroboration of his story
by Carlos Torre and John Carpertlni
convinced the head of the detective de
partment that Oliva's statement was
straight.
Oliva is about 21 years of age, and
is employed in Le Breton's law offices
on Montgomery street.
Accompanied by Detectives Bralg
and Tom Gibson, he went over the
ground in the afternoon. He was taken
from the point where he first saw the
mysterious stranger to the point of the
latter's sudden disappearance.
LOST IN THE PARK.
Oliva retold his Btory of following the
stranger as he went over the ground
with the detectives. He said:
"My suspicions were first aroused
when I saw a man going in a southerly
direction on the east side of Mason
street, between Green and Vallejo,
somewhere around 10:80 o'clock on
Wednesday night. He was carrying a
big bundle, wrapped up in a blanket.
It was such a bundle as would cre
ate suspicion. It was in the middle of
the block when I first saw him. He
walked at a fairly fast pace. I must
have been thirty feet behind him. He
turned east into Vallejo street and kept
on the north side of the street until
about twenty feet below the lamp
post, which Is about two-thirds of the
block down from Mason. He then went
over to the south side of the street.
"In front of the Bellevue lodging
house, where the stranger dropped the
body, it was dark, and I could see but
his outline. He emerged from this
shadow into the light of the grocery
at the corner. I at once noticed
that he had rid himself of his bundle.
I couldn't tell what he had done with
it, and did not learn what became of
it until Informed by Carlos Torre and
John Carpertlni that a strange bundle
was lying on Vallejo Btreet, near
Powell.
"From Vallejo street he crossed over
to the east side of Powell street and
turned along that street toward the
bay. I kept quite a distance behind
him and had quite a little difficulty in
keeping track of him. Several persons
passed at the time and I got them con
fused somewhat, but I made sure of
my man when he passed a store where
there was a light. I continued after
him and kept at about a distance of
fifty feet. When we came to Filbert
6treet I lost track of him. I believe he
went through the park, as there were
some other men going his way and
some of them went through the park.
I waited around for some moments,
then I concluded to go back. I met
the two boys and they told me of the
body in the bundle."
COULD NOT IDENTIFY.
Oliva describes the man as being
about 5 feet 9 inches in height and
weighing about 160 pounds. He said he
wore dark clothes and appeared to be
shabbily dressed. He has very little
confidence In his ability to identify him.
The only chance is that he might be
able to recognize his build and walk.
As soon as Oliva appeared on the
scene, a curious mob eagerly sought
to catch sight of the youth, who prob
ably was the cause of upsetting the
plans of the murderer, and through
him the police may capture the culprit.
Young Ollva appeared very shy. He
kept his hand continually over his face
so that newspaper photographers could
not get a shot at him. He pointed out
WILL RUN
MURDERERS
TO EARTH
Chief of Police Dinan Says
Force Will Not Relax in
Hunt for Fiends Until
They Are in Prison Cell
PLACES FAITH IN
CAPTAIN BURNETT
Worst Crime in Years Con
fronts New Head of De
partment Shortly After Re
ceiving His Appointment
With the ink hardly dry upon his
commission as Chief of Police, Jere
miah Dlnan was on the scene of the
Russian Hill crime at the break of day
and took personal charge of operations.
San Franclsoo's latest head of the Po
llco Department Is confronted upon bis
induction into office with one of the
most mysterious and shocking of trag
edies. His many years of training as a
detective eminently fit him to direct
the movements of the upper office men,
and every effort will be put forth by
him to run the perpetrator of the das
tardly crime to earth. Chief Dlnan is
not taking the case out of the hands of
Captain of Detectives Burnett, but Is
exercising a general supervision over
all of the officers on the case.
In addition to the entire upper office
force a special detail of twelve police
men In Dlaln clothes are at work. A
consultation between Chief Dinan, Cap
tain Burnett and the detectives on the
case was held at headquarters last
night and a definite plan of action was
outlined. This the officials refuse to
disclose on the ground that lt will In
terfere with their efforts to capture the
guilty persons. It Is understood, how
ever, that a search will be made of
every house in the vicinity of the crime
for clews to the place where the crime
was committed.
Captain Burnett Is of the opinion that
several were concerned In the brutal
crime and the motive was undoubtedly
revenge. He Inclines to the belief that
death was instantaneous and the mu
tilation of the remains was done to fa
cilitate the removal of all traces of the
crime. The fact that the autopsy re
veals undigested food in the stomach
and aesophagus Indicates to him that
the unfortunate man was Btruck down
while eating his evening meal. Nothing
of a definite nature that would lead to
the capture of the fiends responsible
for the crime has been discovered, but
several clews are being exploited.
the different places at which pedes
trians passed the bearer of the dread
burden and gave the detectives other
points that might be of asslstanoe to
them.
All this time the crowd became great
er. All pushed and jostled to catch a
glimpse of Oliva and many times the
police officers were forced to shove
them aside to gain headway.
Oliva was very reluctant to talk to
any one but the detectives at first, but
he was finally willing to answer ques
tions of newspaper men and relate his
experience of the night before.
He boarded the car with the detec
tives and went back to his employment.
Jean Babtiste Curet, a watchman,
who lives at 730 Vallejo street, cor
roborates the story told by Oliva, Look-
Ing out of his window at about 10:30
Wednesday night he saw a man car
rying a peculiarly Bhaped bundle on his
shoulder. Close behind was a youth
who was walking swiftly to keep up
with the man with the bundle. They
turned across the street toward the
Bellevue House, where the man cast
aside his burden.
The man who carried the bundle was
about 5 feet 7 Inches in height, Curet
said, and seemed to be about 60 years
old. How he knew this Curet could not
tell, for he did not seem to know
whether the man had a beard or was
clean shaven.
The bearer of the burden wore a soft
black hat and dark clothing. When
questioned closely by Policeman Ba
kulich, who knows the Latin quarter
and Its ways, Curet claimed that he
had only got a passing glimpse of the
man.
Boost Their Quarry \o Freedom.
When the steamship Senator sailed for
Seattle and Victoria on Wednesday morning a
little delegation of Police Department man
hunters was gathered on Broadway wharf.
The m-en in blue had a warrxnt for the ar
rest of one John Murray, charged with de
frauding an Innkeeper. The steamer was
searched and Murray's wife and children were
found, but no trace of Murray. The policemen
watched the gangplank until lt was hauled
ashore. With them was the Innkeeper, on
whose complaint the warrant had been Issued
and who was there to point out the man
wanted. Ihe plank was hauled In, lines were
cast jff and the Senator started to move Into'
the stream. The disappointed innkeeper walked
away. The people on the dock were waving
good-bys to friends on the streamer and the
police relieved of their anxious watch, were
wiping beads of perspiration from broad and
.narrow brows when suddenly a man came
sprintinp down the dock.
"My QoJ. I've missed the boat," he cried.
"That's all right," said Captain Wallace,
general superintendent of the company, who
cannot keep away from the wharf on a sail
ing day. "Here quartermaster, pass a line
over here. Come on, my man, we'll get you
on board."
The line wu passed over the steamer's side
and ttve belated passenger grabbed lt.
"Here, boys." said Captain Wallace to the
policemen, "give him a boost"
The men with the warrant boosted and the
passenger landed safely on the Senator's deck.
The Senator was well into the stream and
started on her way seaward, when the Inn
keeper came panting down the dock. He rushed
up to one of the policemen.
"Well, you got him. Where did jwu take
him?"
"Take whom? where?" replied the police
man.
"WJiom," shrieked the Innkeeper, "why.
John Murray. I saw three of you grab him at
the end of the dock there."
Muiray is on his way to a State where
jumping a board bill is not a misdemeanor.
"Well. I gave him a blamed small boost
anyway," said Policeman Henneberry, as he
stnwed the warrant In his breast pocket.

WANTS FREIGHT IN HURRY
Big Steel Shipments
for Japan to Be
Rushed.
The Pacific Mall Company has con
tracted to ship from this port for Japan
between now and May 3 the largest
quantity of machinery and structural
Iron ever handled at this port within
such space of time. The loading facil
ities at the Mail wharf will be tried
to the utmost, and the Ingenuity of
Captain Wilson and his army of steve
dores will be taxed by the problem of
transferring some of the very large
pieces from shore to ship.
In addition to the flood of steel and
machinery which has flowed from the
East to the Far Bast through this port
with little Interruption since a time pre
ceding the beginning of the Rusao-
Japanese war, there will be a big ship
ment of local produots. One firm in
this city has about completed a con
tract for part of the bridge work of
the Manchurian Railroad. Five hun
dred tons of this structural steel is now
ready for shipment, and this the Pa
cific Mail Company has contracted to
have afloat not later than May 3, the
date set for the sailing of the liner
Korea.
Nearly all of the steel and machinery
is for Japan, and most of it would
count as contraband if Russia had any
thing to say about Oriental waters. In
the event of the Russian fleet being
victorious the Pacific Mail Company's
luck may change and some of its crack
liners may be dealt with by the Czar
as Japan has treated the foreign
steamers which tried to take food and
coal into Vladivostok. Japan feels con
fident in her naval strength, but she
is taking no chances, and the Pacific
Mail Company has agreed to let her
have her steel and machinery in a
hurry.

PITCHER WHALEN IS MAKING
BASEBALL HISTORY.
Twirls Twenty-Seven Rounds
for die Seals Without
Being scored Against
CONTEST PROVES FAST
Sensational Plays Are Made
bj the Members of Rival
Teams at Kecreation l*ark
Jimmy Whalen Is making, baseball
history in thij leacue. He finished
up twenty-seven rounds yesterday and
still no ball team has scored against
him. It will not take James long to
establish a world's record if he â wades
In and repeats this trick again. Port
land never had a chance yesterday.
Score: San Francisco 8. Portland 0.
The game was a remarkable one â
an exhibition the fan does not have
the pleasure of garlng upon every
<sa>. The best Portland secured off
Whalen's offerings waa two hits. One
of these came in the seventh, while
the ninth produced the other. Mohler
cut off two near second base with a
pair of sensational stops which be
wildÂ«>red the fans. San Francisco
fielded perfectly behind Whalen.
French started in to do the tossing
for the Portlanders, and the Seals
could not get a man on the bases
for three spasms. French seemed to
have everything and the fielders were
supporting him in grand style all the
time. Spencer broke it up with a hit
to third In the fourth. He stole and
kept on going when McLean threw
wild to second and came through on
Hildebrand's clout along the first base
line.
Joe N>alon registered another for
the seals in the next spasm. He took
t pass, stole without waiting and ar
rived when Wilson put one out to
right for half a trip. A base on balls
to Hildebrand, coupled with Cates'
balk and a couple of sacrifices, com
pleted a pretty hit and run play and
pave the Seals their last one In the
seventh.
The game wa.= reeled off in an hour
and thirteen minutes â a record that Is
liable to stand for a while. Both teams
fiplded in gTand style. Mohler's work
was phenomenal and earned rounds of
applause. Thp score:

KING DROPS EASY FLY
Misplay Allows Captain Euss
Hall to Score the First
Run for the Northerners
OAKLAND, April Chief Russ Hall
and his Siwash braves administered
another dose of bitter shut-out medi
cine this afternoon to the Commuters.
While the locals were swallowing the
zero i pill Seattle accumulated a brace
of tallies. The first run was created in
the sixth inning, and would never hav.e
come into existence but for a muff by
King, who dropped an easy fly dis
patched out to him by Hall. The Seat
tle captain Journeyed to second on the
mlsplay. James advanced his com
mander to the third corner on a hit,
and Russ slid in over the plate on a
poke by Roach to Devereaux, which the
brindle-topped fellow was unable to
pass to Oswald in time to tag the slider
out. Miller, the star slugger of the Si
washes, scored the Beiond run for his
tribe. He hit safely in the seventh
frame, ambled to second- on a sacrifice
â¢by Baehr and registered on a scorching
grounder to left center by Hall.
Skel Roach twirled reliably and al
lowed but three bingles. Aloskirnan was
on the mound for the Oaks. He Bent
five northerners to the initial sack and
was touched for seven safe hits. Miller
was to the fore in the field for the
Seattles and captured everything that
went into his garden. In the second he
hauled in a screamer from Kelly's club
that looked good for two sacks when it
was started. There was a marked im
provement noticeable in the team work
of the Siwashes to-day, and no error
marked their performance. Score:

TALK OF PEACE
CHICAGO, April 6.â A mild sensation
was created in turfdom to-day by the
announcement of an individual close to
the Western Jockey Club that an
agreement had been reached by the
members of the Western Jockey Club
and of the American Turf Association
whereby a delegation consisting of
three men from each body will meet at
Cincinnati in less than a week for the
purpose of entering into some peace
compact for the good of racing in the
West, and particularly for that of Chi
cago.
Stewards Martin Nathanson, Gtoortre
W. Perkins and Lawrence A. Young
will represent the Western Jockey Club,
while the American Turf Association
will be represented by Thomas C. Mo-
DowelL Captain 8. 8. Brown and Mayor
Julius Flelschmann. The last named
gentlemen comprise the board of con
trol of the American Turf Association.

Stanford Men Try Berkeley Oral.
BERKELEY, April 6. â The Stan
ford track team of twenty-five mem
bers came to the university to-day to
get Its bearings on the track where
the intercollegiate field day will be
held on the 15th inst. Trainer "Dad"
Moulton accompanied his charges.
Two hours were spent by the Stan
ford contingent In work on the cinder
path and other parts of the field.
Nothing in the way of strenuous work
was attempted. Trainer Moulton told
the California men that his team of
athletes is as good an aggregation as
any he has ever handled at Stanford.
Miller is the star of the team, his
specialty being the mile run. He Is
also clever at longer or shorter dis
tances and may start in three events,
a circumstance that, according to
Moulton, is unusual in a field day pro
gramme.

LOS ANGELES, April 6.â With only

OARSMEN PLEAD
FOR FAIR FLAY
SpÂ»elai Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
The boating representatives of the
University of California are out with
a sportsmanlike statement which
should do much to end the controversy
between the two universities regarding
a suitable course for the Inter
collegiate boat race. It is pointed out,
truthfully, that unusual weather con
ditions prevailed on the estuary last
year on the day of the intercollegiate
race, and that a recurrence of such
conditions is not likely. The state
ment of the Berkeley men follows:
; The, misconceptions, both general and par
ticular, touching the respective' views of
Stanford and California on the rowing ques
tion are so likely at present to ruin, the brignt
prospects of intercollegiate boating in Cali-
Jornia that It seems besi to vary the monotony
of the proceedings by shedding the light of
truth on the subject.
Briefly, the positions of the two universities
are as follows: Stanford's objections to the
Oakland estuary as a race course are basud,
first, on the possibility of rough water for the
day of the race; second, on the presumption
that California practices on this race course
and, therefore, will have the advantage of
more familiarity with whatever rough water,
eddies, tides, whirlpools or other hidden or re
vealed benefits and detriments the stream may
provide; third, that as the cardinal made the
concession of rowing there last year and found
the elements too harsh for her infant oars
men the blue and gold should, as John L.
Sullivan once remarked, "reciprocate with re
turn" by yielding everything thi6 year to
Stanford; and, lastly, that the general senti
ment at Stanford is po bitterly opposed to the
Â«etuary that there would be no Stanford sup
porters to cheer the cardinal to victory.
California's answers to these objections are
that last year the day of the race was an un
fortunate exception to the general rule of
smooth water for the estuary in the morning
and parly part of the afternoon. Furthermore,
she avers that she does not practice there, but
on the other end of the estuary and on the
canal. She will also sign an airreement to re
main away from this course. More than this,
she will give Stanford every opportunity the
latter may desire to study all the advantages
these mysterious waters may conceal from the
ordinary human rye. She also feels, and Just
ly, that Stanford's reiteration of the belief
that California does practice there and doe*
possess the occult knowledge Imputed to her
Is in the face of the latter" s sincere state
ments and promises a deliberate and unwar
ranted ineult to her rowing men. She believes
also that rough water is no more beneficial
to her than to Stanford. The course at Red
wood ff quite aa choppy as is the canal wherÂ«
California is still trying to steady her shell.
COURSE IS A FAIR ONE.
'Whatever advantages thÂ« estuary may offer
to one of two crews conaiit solely In the fact
that the water is naturally a UtUe more rapid
In the center than on the sides. Aa the crews
must row In the lines marked cnX tor them,
and away from the center, the course la prao
tically fair to both. And from the viewpoint
of the spectators ma& of aooeawlblllty the
estuary, with its parallel railroad lines, >>f
undisputed advantages over any either avail
able course In California â either for a two
mile or a four-mile race.
Both In this latter respect and in that of
faimeea to each crew it la superior to the
Thames at New London, the scene of the an
nual Harvard-Yale contest. There the "eel
grasa side" is believed to be two or three
lengths slower than the other. But the idea
of objecting to the coarse for that reason, or
at considering the opportunity for choice of
aides otherwise than as one of the fortunes of
war and of true sportsmanship, would be re
garded there as too childish for discussion.
It la this combination of advantages tn faot
that prompted the champion sculler of hit
time. Ned Hanlon. to pronounce the Oakland
estuary the superior of any course In thÂ«
world, with the exception of the Paramatta
River of Australia.
Now. as to the question of "concessions."
Stanford did not "concede" the point of row
ing on the estuary last year. On the con
trary she asked to be admitted as a con
testant In California's race with 'Washington
and California extended her that courtesy
Furthermore, she agreed, through her boat
club president of that year, to row annually
on the estuary. Thus we see that every one
of Stanford's objections to this almost ideal
course Is based either on false presumptions,
prejudices or on some other consideration not
patent to the bystander. And when we add
that California's final concession to row alter
nately on Stanford's choice of waters the
Stockton Slough, and on her own. the estuary
or on any other suitable course, has been met
by Stanford with a somewhat dictatorial
"cocky" refusal to row anywhere but at Stock
ton this year, with the choice for subsequent
years to be left open to discussion it will
be seen that California has little or no option
other than to devote her attentions exclusively
to Washington.
CALIFORNIA ASKS NO FAVORS.
In further deference to the truth and Justice
! of the matter It should be said that California
is Just as desirous as is Stanford of a â¢ "fair
race and no favors." â¢.">' She knows the estuary
offers the opportunity for these desirable con
ditions. Her preference for this most available
course "Is born I solely of | her ; wish to ' win. for
boating the place it , deserves as the cleanest,
most healthful ! and I most | spectacular of inter
collegiate ; sport*. ;;â  She ? knows, too, that ' thia
consummation devoutly to be wished -can never
be gained until - the undergraduates, , alumni
and â  general public can .be brought to witness
at least one well-contested, beautiful thrilling
exhibition of scientific Intercollegiate oarsman
ship. To that end , both varsity and freshmen
have been training ; as - faithfully , as f their op
portunities would permit to correct their faults
of style and reflect honor upon their university
and . themselves. -; Intercollegiate " contests ; are

BERKELEY LOSES
GIANT PITCHER
Heine Heitmuller and Catch
er Bliss Are Ruled Out
of University Athletics
TEAM BADLY CRIPPLED
Star Players Are Charged
With Having Taken Part
in a Professional Game
BETRKELEY, April 6. â A bomb
shell was dropped Into athletic cir
cles at the university this evening:,
when the announcement was made
that "Helftle" Heitmuller, captain and
pitcher of the varsity baseball team,
and Bliss, catcher of the team, and
next to Heitmuller its most Important
member, have been ruled out of ath
letics at the university by the faculty
committee on athletics.
The offense for which these two
young college players suffer expul
sion from athletic contests consists in
their participation In a baseball game
at Fresno recently, when the Heese
mans played the league team of Oak
land. Money was charged for admis
sion and professionals took part in
the contest. This constituted grounds
upon which the faculty committee
felt obliged to act. Drastic measures
were decided upon as punishment for
the offense.
The original charge that Heitmul
ler played under an assumed name in
the game at Fresno and the charge
that he took money for his services
was not credited by the faculty com
mittee. The men were cleared of
those charges.
The meeting at which the two ath
letes were ruled out of future athletic
contests was held late this afternoon.
Professor Edwards and Professor H.
B. Horrey were the only members
present.
The loss of Heitmuller and Bliss,
the strongest two members of the Uni
versity of California baseball Xeam,
weakens the nine so that victory in
the game with Stanford next Satur
day is almost despaired of by the blue
and gold adherents. This baseball
championship was the one athletic
event of the year California felt hope
ful of winning. The football games
were both taken by Stanford, the
Carnot debate went to the cardinal
and the field day is to be a very close
affair, with the presumption In Stan
ford's favor. Now it is feared the
baseball championship also will go to
the Palo Alto contingent.
Newman undoubtedly will take
Heitmuller's place as pitcher, but
there is no substitute available for
Bliss* position. He has done all the
catching for all the pitchers. Gillls
may go behind the bat, but it is
deemed hardly possible that in two
days a green man, working with a
pitcher strange to him, will be able
to form a battery of sufficient skill
and strength to defeat Stanford.
EASILY THROWS
JIU JITSU STAR
NEW YORK, Aprtl Â«.â Before a
crowd of forty-five hundred persons
George Bothner, the American light
weight champion wffcsjfler, defeated K.
Hlgashi, the leading Japanese jiu jitsu
expert, to-night in Grand Central Pal
ace in three straight falls. The man
agement of the Palace seemed unable
to handle the crowd. The entrances
were Wocked and the fire regulations
were set at naught. Chief of Police
McAdoo was present to see if the Jiu
jitsu method would do for the police
force. He was much disappointed at
the result.
The match proved most interesting,
although it was after 1 o'clock before it
ended. Bothner took the first fall with
a leg lock and neck hold in 14 minutes
35 seconds; the second with neck and
crotch hold in 1 hour SI min
utes 18 seconds, and the third
with crotch hold In 16 minutes
20 seconds. Hlgashi was first in
the ring, attired in regular Jiu Jitsu
costume. He was soon followed by
Bothner, in similar regalia, looking
a typical "Jap." He appeared out of
place in this wrestling habit. His sec
onds were John J. O'Brien and George
Jonsen.
The referee of the bout -was "Tim"
Hurst and the Judges were "Johnny"
O'Brien for Bothner and Irving Han
cock for Hlgashi. There was probably
fifteen pounds difference in the men's
weight in favor of Bothner. The match
was a combination Jiu Jitsu-oatch-as
catch-can affair, best three falls out of
five.
arÂ« also necessary outlets for the youthful
exuberance of animal spirits that will other
wise generally seek less desirable vents. If,
therefore, rowing, the acknowledged aristocrat
of intercollegiate athletics, must be doomed by
prejudice or personal interest or petty mis
trust It will be a sad commentary on our
Western Ideaa. of true sportsmanship. It will
also be an edifying criticism of our notions of
the ethics of sport, of the "deference of the in
dividual to the general interest.
Finally let It be understood that Cali
fornia's concession to row anywhere provided
Stanford will agree to the alternate course
compromise Is Inspired by her desire to start
right. The Importance of so doing and the
difficulty of recovering from a false beginning
are evident to every student of the history of
Intercollegiate athletics. The matter Is cer
tainly worth a serious thourht. Let us hop*
It will receive it.

BUDGET, A 40 TO 1 CHANCE,
HOME FIRST AT OAKLAND
St. Fjrancis Defies Form by Capturing
the Two-Year-Old Scramble
at a Fancy Quotation.
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
When tha fields are large and un
wieldy it is practically impossible to
suppress the long shots, and two rank
outsiders, Budget and St. Francis,
added spice and flavor to the sport
yesterday at Oakland. The other four
numbers went to favorites, and if the
bookmakers made any money they
were not crowing over It. The attend
ance was large and betting brisk.
Tommy Taylor made a parachute de'
scent with Budget, a 40 to 1 shot, in
the opening event, landing flrst at tÂ£e
wire a head before Silurian, the sec
ond choice. The winner, a bay mare
by Ducat, owned and bred by Dr. C.
E. Farnum, got away from the post
poorly, or the finish would not have
been close. Ledus, the 9 to 5 choice,
also had miserable racing luck, and
then ran third.
F. E. SHAW WINS HAXDILT.
Bianchi & McGovern's chestnut horse
F. E. Shaw, a 6 to 5 favorite, merely
breezed in for the split of the seven
furlong event. He had Larsen on his
back and finished five lenghts before
Florlana Belle and Tannhauser.
One day in the long ago, St. Francis,
a strapping son of Rubicon, equaled
the coast record for three and a half
furlongs. Everybody gat upright in
their seats, rubbered again at the tim
er's stand and exclaimed "Well!
wouldn't that tickle the solee of your
feet?" Since then, always quoted at
short odds, his speed left him. Yes
terday in the five-furlong 2-year-old
jaunt he regained it at odds of 13 to 1.
Lloyd Fountain took a trick at the
wheel and, dodging treacherous eddies
and ehoals, had the big fellow in front
from start to finish. I'm Joe always,
a contender, ran second. Aprirs Pride,
a 20 to 1 shot, took the show. Knapp,
astride Iron "Watson, the favorite, fin
ished fifth.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL
JOHN V. M'JtLZCKKLS Proprietor
ADDRESS ALL COMMUNICATIONS TO
JOHN McXACGHT Manager
PUBLICATION OFFICE THIRD AND MARKET STREETS. SAN FRANCISCO
FRIDAY APRIL 7, ,1905
BEAUTIFYING THE CITY.
THE Supervisors are considering the annual budget and find that
the administrative departments of the city demand $9,000,000
for their use for the year, which is $2,000,000 in excess of the
nues. Tnat part of this excess demanded for the schools is legi
timate. It is caused partly by expanding needs of the schools and
partly by the act of the Legislature in diverting State support. The
Supervisors should attend to the needs of the schools and do their
pruning elsewhere.
The people of San Francisco want a systematic policy adopted
with the beautifying of the city as its object.' To this end they have
voted many millions in bonds for parks and other surface improve
ments, permanent in their nature, which will enhance the natural at
tractions of the city, reduce its slums and contribute to the values of
property and to the health and pleasure of the people. Â San Fran
cisco is set in the midst of noble surroundings. No other city in
the world equals it in the grandeur of ocean, bay and mountain
scenery. It should be the gem of such a circlet of beauty. Its own
variety of surface offers every facility for making it as noted for its
nobility and beauty as it is for its business and enterprise. If it is to
be a $9,000,000 city, as demanded by the departments, let it be
brought up to the high mark which justifies such an annual ex
penditure, r
The people want this done, and are willing to be liberal in order
to procure it. They want the streets relieved of overhead trolleys
and the wires put underground. They want the coming parks and
playgrounds in all parts of the city, where the popular vote located
them, put under way and developed as rapidly as possible. They
want every mean and squalid feature removed from the streets. With
its advantages of climate and its scenic surroundings San Francisco
can be made to rival Paris in attractiveness, as it now does in the
buoyant and bright characteristics of its people. Great material
growth has commenced and has an impulse that will not slacken
until our population reaches the million mark. But we must see
that the growth is symmetrical and on the lines of beauty and grace.
In carrying out this work the people must act through the gov
ernment they elect to represent them. A city administration low and
squalid in its morals and motives cannot direct municipal growth i
on high lines. A government by graft and for graft cannot clothe a j
city in garments of grace^nor make it attractive. Called on to pay. j
$9,000,000 for government the taxpayers may well ask themselves if j
what they get is likely to be worth the money.
Do they want nearly $18,000,000, voted in bonds for public im- <
provements, to be spent by a Board of Works whose president is 1
under indictment for a felony? Do they want to put $9,000,000 of 1
the regular budget and $18,000,000. the proceeds of the bonds, into
the hands of an administration that sees no impropriety in keeping at
the head of its most important department a man indicted for sub- j
ornation of perjury done to save from punishment a felon guilty of
crimes against the ballot? Is there a single taxpayer in San Fran-{
cisco who would put $27,000,000 of his own money into such hands |
to be expended for any purpose? If there be such a man we would i
like him to stand up and be counted.
That $27,000,000 is the prize for which the push is fighting.
It affords such opportunity for gigantic graft that the fight for it is
going to be desperate. In all the history of this city no other such j
prize has been dangled before the eyes of the push. It equals more [
than half* the entire revenues of the United States Government in â¢
iB6O. It is more than half the assessed value of the large city of Oak- â 
land. The present "system" wants it. The framers and workers of
that system of graft, corruption and immorality are capable of chame- !
leonlike changes in order to get it. They are capable of professing to [
dump overboard ever}' existing personality in the city government,
and of substituting other veneers for the system to lull and lure the j
people into permitting present practices to continue in new hands. !
The people should be on the alert against this subtle policy of ]
deception. If San Francisco is to be made beautiful, if our park !
system is to be developed and $27,000,000 of public money is to be j
spent for these and other public purposes honestly, every dollar to \
bring 100 cents in return benefits, the people must begin by cleansing j
the government. It may be expected that issues will be cunningly \
devised to divert attention from this main and only issue. This j
policy is already in sight. But by starting now and keeping the one j
purpose in view, the system and all its beneficiaries, its open and i
. secret grafters, its push and its purposes, can be routed and sent j
crashing in a common ruin. Every improvement club and committee, i
every moral influence and every citizen who pays for government j
and does not live on it must combine to keep the foul fingers of the
system off the expenditure of $27,000,000, to the end that that vast
sum shall go into better government, and the permanent beautifying 1
of the city. _____Â«____ j
THE CHICAGO ELECTION.
/^^"NHICAGO has made a record for going Republican in national
and Democratic in city elections, and has not changed. On
Tuesday Judge Dunne was elected Mayor by a majority of
Q45 ovrr a^- His opponent. John M. Harlan, made the mistake that
wise political reformers never make. He has been conspicuous in
hunting down, expelling and punishing corrupt men in his own
party. In this way he drove the Republican push into the Demo
cratic party, and his mistake was in running for Mayor himself.
All of the elements and influences that he had fought were combined
against him and he lost.
After all the noise that was made about municipal ownership,
and though Judge Dunne held a radical position on that question
and promoted the belief that by some financial alchemy and mone
tary mystery he would immediately take over the street railroads, it
appears that the courts need not be scared. When his election was
assured by the returns, the new Mayor said he had no doubt that
"ultimately" Chicago would own the street railroads. Mr. Harlan
favored the same thing "ultimately," and the only issue was be
tween his "r.itimate" and Judge Dunne's "immediate" policy. Some
time ago Chicago voted for municipal ownership, but Mayor Har
rison showed that it is impossible under existing financial condi
tions.
The election suggests a study of the reasons why so many of
our large cities give overwhelming majorities for the national poli
cies of the Republican party, but elect Democratic municipal gov
ernments. This study may be extended to San Francisco, for here
the same record has been made ever since 1896.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. FRTDAY. APRIL 7. 1905.
A MAN gets up in a hurry because he has gone to bed late,
â¢*â *â  says the New York World. He dresses in a hurry, gobbles
do'tvn his breakfast in a hurry, cannot spare the time that a bath
zvould take, rushes for a car, gets to his office as fast as the car
will take him; works hard all morning: dashes oat to lunch,
swallows food that is often inadequate in quality and unsuitable
JEALOUSY IS ALWAYS FUTILE
NEXT to mal de mer, jealousy is the malady â which
evokes least sympajhy. It is something which the
afflicted individual has to get over by himself, and
the less he tells the world about his troubles the
more it will respect him.
Cruel as the grave, undoubtedly it still is. just as it
was in the days of Solomon. Nevertheless, to-day, the
one "who dotes, yet doubts; suspects, yet fondly loves,"
as some one has described this Jaundiced mood of woe,
wears in real life the comic and not the tragic mask.
We may thrill over the rage of Othello, who smoth
ered Desdemona with a pillow because he thought she
had been playing drop the handkerchief with Casaio, but
when we see a Jealous husband among our acquaintances
we feel that he is not merely trying practical Jokes on
himself, but thai he is also inviting others to Join in the
game. And we are very sorry for his wife, especially if
she bravely pretends that her matrimonial equipage is
drawn by a thoroughbred, when anybody who passes her
can see that she is endeavoring to manage a wall-eyed
horse that paddles.
Love is never so secure that it has no fear of change.
If it were It would not be love, but an emotional klrftf

are inevitably minute estrangements which act upon one's
mental health like nervous shocks.

lover painfully. What of it* It is all part of the ex
perience.
When you fall in love you have got to face the pen
alty, just as you must when you insist upon picking the
rose with the thorn, upon meeting the tiger or upon
playing bridge with a debutante. Best, then, to borrow a
leaf from Marie Baphkirtseff's notebook and chew the
T\id of spicy reflection instead of the loco weed of mad
3espalr.
You recall that the Russian girl fell in love with an
English Duke, and that she was overwhelmed with grief
3nd hopelessness when she heard of his Impending mar
-iage to another. But a year later we find her writing
sagely, with an insight which was a veritable flash of
genius. "Nothing in the world is lost. If we cease to
love one individual, this affection is immediately trans
ferred to another even without our being conscious of
t. If one does not love a man. one loves a dog or a
piece of furniture, and with the same ardor, only In a
Sifferent fashion."
Jealousy is always futile and sometimes it takes a
:rasy course which lands the miserable lover in the pen
tentlary or in the electric chair. Shake off from your
â ose this green and yellow caterpillar thing, instead of
letting it spoil the fragrance which you long to enjoy.
Don't seek to crush it under foot, for, as the childish
superstition warns, perhaps 'twould bring the rain. Who
knows? Just let it go.
Atmosphere That Intoxicates
Visitors to the great wine cellars of
Spain, says the Journal of Inebriety,
sometimes suffer from symptoms of
alcoholic intoxication. In some of these
places, It Is said, as much as half an
ounce of absolute alcohol Is found in
five or six cubic feet of air.
In London and on the Continent bar
keepers who work In badly ventilated
saloons are practically drunkards with
out swallowing any liquor. Prussian
and French authorities force all estab
lishments where spirits are sold to
thoroughly ventilate the premises twice
a day.
Mrs. Fondmarâ Doctor, my
daughter sits and gazes Into that

SUSPENDERS FOR
FAIR FEMININITY
Suspenders for women next.
That's the latest edict of the dress
makers, and theirs is a law that, like
those of the Medes and Persians, must
not be bucked up against, remarks the
Philadelphia Inquirer.
Silk suspenders; satin suspenders.
Dainty trifles running from the -waist
in front, over the shoulders and cross
ing behind.
Just like a man's.
Wont that be delightful? To get
Just one more brace, as it were, on to
the dear male attire.
They must not be worn with a loose
blouse, but over a tight-fitting waist.
They have a delightful renewing ef
fect, too. For instance, the waist
without them and the waist with them
are two different waists.
What benefit otherwise, nobody
knows. But they will be pretty and
becoming, and chic on any costume.
And after all, that's all.
THE GOAT.
The goat Is an amusing beast.
On circus posters nursed;
His head is the butt end of himâ
He travels butt end first.
f Tis true he feedeth on tin cans
And other brlc-a-brae.
And wears a bored expression.
And eternally says: "Ba-a!"
When he has quit ttiis world of sin.
Eternally stopped buttin".
We greet him in our dining-rootn â
He comes disguised as mutton;
He has the cutest little tail.
A set of horns, also;
They're each at different ends of himâ
At the butt ends, you know.
I would not care to meet a goat
And pat It on the head;
I hate trained nurses all the wnlle
Tiptoeing round my bed;
My father and my mother, too
It worries them like sin;
A goat's the lmpolltest beastâ
He's always butting in.

TRUE OPTIMISM.
Senator Deptw say* that the most
Interesting Instance of true optimism
that ever came to his notice was that
afforded by an old man living near
Peekskill, N. T.
This old chap, who could give Mark
Tapley points on how to be cheerful
under adverse conditions, was a char
acter in his way, and nearly every one
in Peekskill enjoyed drawing him out.
He suffered from a combination of
palsy and St. Vltus' dance, and when
he would painfully duck his head from
side to side in the manner peculiar
to his complaint the effect was most
distressing.
One day a sympathetic person said
to the old fellow: "It must be dread
ful to le afflicted in this way."
"Oh, I don't know," blithely respond
ed the Peekskill man. 'It has its ad
vantages. Now It's just the thing
when I go to a two-ringed circus."

Kef used a Drink Edward
Miller Exhibits Impa
tience and Lands in Jail
BERKELEY, April 6.â The famous
ealoon-smashing exploits of Carrie Na
tion were recalled to-day when Ed
ward Miller hurled rocks and clubs
through the mirrors of Charles Peter
sen's saloon at San Pablo avenue and
Charming way, leaving in the wake of
the missiles a wreck of glass and sa
loon furnishings in general.
Miller's aeal to make mincemeat of
the costly furniture and glassware In
Pfctersen's drink emporium was not In
spired by the motives which Mrs. Na
tion was wont to declare moved her
in the saJoon-smashing business. Ac
cording to the outraged liquor vender,
Miller's wrath was excited when the
bartender answered his request for a
drink of whisky with the reply that if
coin was forthcoming; the drinks would
be brought forth â otherwise not.
"So my credit isn't good for a drink,
eh?" yelled Miller, and with that he
left the place, returning in a minute
with clubs and rocks, which were anon
flung with abandon at the mirrors and
bottles and decanters and other fur
nishings there installed.
The bartender and his employer kept
under cover while Miller was diepos
lng of his munitions of war, but once
the saloon-wrecker had left. Petersen
started in pursuit. Others joined him
and Miller was captured. Deputy Mar
shal Carey took him to the County Jail
in Oakland, where he was charged with
malicious mischief. He will be ar
raigned before Justice Edgar to-mor
row morning. Petersen estimates his
loss through Miller's recklessness at
several hundred dollars.
CHARGED WITH
EMBEZZLEMENT
OAKLAND, April 6. â Arrested on a
telegraphic warrant from Trinidad,
Colo., V. Shoblo, a former employe in
the Treasurer's office there, is in the
County Jail here and states that he is
innooent of any wrongdoing and does
not know what he is wanted for. He
was employed in the courthouse there
for fifteen years, but about six months
ago came to California with his 'wife
and child and started up a small gro
oery business at Sixty-sixth street and
San Pablo avenue, where he was found
this morning by Sheriff Barnett and
taken into custody.
To a query from the Sheriff as to the
nature of the offense for which Shoblo
is wanted, the following reply was re
ceived:
"F. Barnett, Sheriff Alameda County.
Oakland â Hold Shoblo. Bad case em
bezzlement public funds and altering
public records. Amount $1000, and not
through Investigation. May reach sev
eral thouÃands. Felony in this State.
Will come for man with requisition at
once. Hold man at all hazards.
"R. W. DAVIS,"
'Sheriff Las Animas County, Colo."
When shown the telegram Shcrblo
stated that he was perfectly willing to
go back to Trinidad, as he had nothing
to be afraid of. He says that L. M.
Kreeger, under-Sheriff there, is his
father-in-law and that he 1b well
known and has a clean record.
WORKMAN ON SKYSCRAPER
HAS REMARKABLE ESCAPE
Falls With Concrete Floor From
Thirteenth Story of New York
Building.
NEW YORK, April 6.â An addition
has been made to the recent list of flat
house collapses in the northern section
of the city by the fall of 500 pounds of
concrete fire-proofing material through
five floors of a thirteen-story apartment
hotel in course of construction at
Eighty-ninth street and Central Park
West. Charles Dielman, a laborer, was
carried down with the debris. His es
cape from death was remarkable.
All the floors of the new building had
been laid with fire-proof concrete, and
the contractor ascribed the accident to
the moisture resulting from the recent
rainfall, which caused the fire-proofing
to become soggy.
Dielman probably would have been
killed outright had it not been that his
fall was broken at each floor by the
mixture that encased him on his down
ward Journey.

its branches on Larkin street and Pa
cific avenue. This decision is the result
of a conference held yesterday at the
offices of the railroad company, when
the indifference displayed by the man
agement of the company to the needs
of the public provoked the property
owners to a degree â where- they told
President Holland thaÂ£ the Sutter
street Improvement Club would take
steps to force the company to put its
property In better shape. Last week,
while Bankers Brown and Delano of
New York, the principal Eastern own
ers of the United Railroads, were in
this city, the Suuer-street Improve
ment Club was asked to appoint a com
mittee to confer with the officials of the
company, and an appointment â¢ was
made for yesterday afternoon.
COMMITTEE ANGERED.
The principal subject discussed was
the proposition of an underground con
duit electric system^ for the Sutter
street line, and the committee from the
Improvement club had gone to the
meeting prepared to quote figures
showing that it is possible to install
such a system, despite the contrary
claims of the railroad company. The
officials of the latter, however, would
not listen to the suggestion and boldly
informed the committee that they were
determined to install an overhead elec
tric trolley system along the entire Sut
ter-street line. Angered at this defi
ance, the committee sa4d it would never
permit the company to carry out this
plan, and suddenly realizing that their
interviewers were in earnest, the rail
road officials offered to make one con
cession. They eaid they would not
build an overhead system on Pacific
avenue, but would turn the Jackson
etreet cable line into that thoroughfare.
To this proposition the improvement
club committee demurred on the
ground that it was an attempt to
throw "bop" to the Pacific-avenue resi
dents at the expense of those on Jack
son street, and, if carried out, the di
version of traffic would mean a great
loss to the merchants along Larkin,
Polk and Sutter streets.
WILL INVOKE LAW.
Manager Chapman of the railroad
company, wflen confronted with the
statement that an underground con
duit system was feasible along Sutter
street, said he did not care If all the
engineers in the country were of that
opinion, he would not believe them.
The treatment accorded the com
mittee by the railroad officials made
them so indignant that they finally
rose and left.
It is now purposed to invoke the
law to compel the company to ac
cord the public proper accommoda
tions, such as are found in other large
cities. Already agents of the property
owners have obtained signatures of
land owners along Sutter street repre
senting 31.000 out of the total 61,000
feet of street frontage, and they have
also induced half of those who signed
the petitions of the United Railroads to
withdraw their signatures. This work
will proceed until every property
owner along Sutter, Larkin, Polk and
Ninth streets and Pacific avenue has
had a chance to express his accord
In the views of the Sutter street Im
provement Club that a modern rail
road system should be installed on
those thoroughfares.
SPIDER'S BITE
CAUSES DEATH
ALAMEDA, April 6.â Poison from
the bite of a spider caused the death
last evening of the infant son of Mr.
and Mrs. W. H. Morgan of 3249 Briggs
avenue.
It is thought by the^ parents of the
baby that the insect dropped from the
ceiling of the room in which the little
one was sleeping and falling upon the
infant's neck inflicted the fatal sting.
When the physician was summoned
the child, who was but eleven days
old, he found that the deadly venom of
the spider had permeated the baby's
system, causing the blood y.jlsoning
which ended the infant's life.

STANFORD STUDENTS GET
TASTE OF IMPRISONMENT
Workman Locks Them in Arch That
Affords the Main Entrance to
University Quadrangle.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, April
6. â Twenty-five of Stanford's most
prominent fraternity men were the
victims of a three hours' involuntary
imprisonment this afternoon in the
great arch that affords the main en
trance to the university quadrangle.
The way into the arch la kept closed
and the students are forbidden to en
ter, but this morning a workman had
been busy cleaning up inside and he
had left temporarily to get a drink.
The adventurous students quietly
stepped inside and cautiously began
the ascent of the iron stairway. It
was noon before they reached the
top, and the employe, who had fin
ished the Job and not knowing that
there were visitors inside, locked the
only means of egress and left for the
stock farm, far away.
In the meantime the college boys
were enjoying: the beautiful scenery
from the very top of the arch, and
they sat around idly for half an hour.
Finally one of them saw the clock
and fearing that they would miss the
fraternity lunch they started pell mell
for the bottom. Great was their sur
prise to find the door locked. There
was no key to be obtained until three
hours later, when the university po
liceman returned to his office, and
they did not dare attract any one's at
tention to their predicament for fear
the university authorities would see
them. Fortunately they had found
several pieces of rope that former
workmen had left, and after two
hours' hot work they succeeded In
making it long enough for them to
risk the descent. It was dangerous,
but firmly convinced that to risk was
to succeed, they each made the long
slide and landed cafe from the .fall
and from the investigation of the uni
versity authorities.

TOWN TRUSTEE
IS UNDER FIRE
StwciSHMsMtch to Tb* CalL
PALO ALTO, April Â«.â A local paper
to-day makes the statement that Fay
ette MJtcneltree, member of the As
sembly for this district, will be re
quested by a committee of cltlsens to
resign the office of Trustee of the town
of Palo Alto. Failing to do so, the
paper announces, this committee will
publish charges reflecting- upon Mitch
eltree's integrity.
Mitcheltree was seen to-night and
said: "You may say absolutely that I
will not resign. There is no truth in
the allegations published to-day. The
only incident that bears on the sub
ject was the proposition I made as a
member of the Board of Trustees to re
peal the ordinance prohibiting slot ma
chines, which has not been enforced,
and to enact a new ordinance licensing
the machines. Dr. C. G. Baldwin and
D. A. Curry visited me and threatened
to make me resign if I did not recede
from that position. I did not under
stand that they represented a commit
tee, but came to me in their individual
capacity. No, I shall not resign, and I
have no fear of any charges that may
be published concerning my official ac
tions."

STANFORD UNTVURSITT. 'April 1
The cleTer actors of Stanford Uni-rer
sity are soon to produce another light
opera. This time, however, they do not
intend to give one that h&s appeared
on the professional stag* They ha**Â»
i written aa entirely original light opera
and will play it on April 10. It Is the
joint work of three students. Delmar
Reynolds, a senior^ constructed the
plot; Homer Curran, a Junior, wrote
the muslo. and Karl â  Btokel, a sopho
more, wrote the lyrtes. The .name of
the opera Is "The Prtnoess E2&oae>~ It
i tells of the adventures ot a Stanford -
professor who discovered . a lone-lost
tribe of Aitecs ii-ring ta Yucatan.
These anclect Indians wÂ«s* Bring to an
their barbarous savagery, but the wily
Stanford Instructor Introduces them to
the American cocktail and crvUlaatioa
speedily follows. ThÂ« taste of J that
first cocktail makes a lasting Xmprea
sion on the natives and they make the
teacher a god to he worshiped. The
Stanford professor at last yearns agaia
f-r his native land, but disinclined to
leav* the beautiful Indian maidtxxs be
hind, he returns to California with the
fairest princesses of thorn allâ the
Princess Enone.
The opera promises to prove a suc
cess at j Stanford j because of, the parti
that are taken by the pretty "co-eds"
of the "university. The fairest of the
500 were chosen to represent t^Â» Indian
damsels who come with the pedagogue.
Quality of voice an& beauty of face and
figure were < what the Junior class,
which is in charge of the production,
insisted upon. . The part of the Princess
Is' carried by Miss Geraldine Brown,
who Is considered the best actress at
Stanford. The others arÂ« Miss Jean
Miller, the Princesses* companion;
Miss Georgina Lyrnan, who sings the
rose song, and Miss Edna Brown, who
sings the pansy song. Miss Mercedes
de Luna takes the part of a clever lit
tle; Indian danseusa. The wily Stan
ford professor is Roy Kellogg, while
the Indian Prince who takes most
earnestly to the prescribed education
in civilization is Jaroei Ray. a sopho
more in the university. x

tsectsl Dispatch to The Call
DUBLIN". April 6. â Arrangements arÂ«
! in progress through which a delegation
! representing the schoolteachers of Ire
land will visit the United States, arriv
i ing In Easter week. Their object will
be to inquire into and study as far as
! possible the system of elementary edu
. cation obtaining In the United Statas,
with the view of placing the results of
j their investigations later on before thÂ«
' educational authorities in England.
; They will represent what la known In
â  Ireland as the National Teachers* Or
ganization. Four men are going outâ
: one to represent each province. Rich
ard Walsh will represent Connaught;
Robert WaJkor. Ulster; Thomas Glyn*.
Leinster, and A. J. Nelson, Munstor.
llt was expected that Douglas Hyde,
I leader of the Gaelic revival movement.
j would bÂ« able to accompany the del*,
gation, but his numerous engagements
in Ireland preclude the possibility at
his doing so.
Thomas O'Doncell, M. P.. who vu a
teacher himself before he becaznt *
member of Parliament, and who. It will
bÂ« remembered, caused some amuse
ment In thp House of Commons by ad-
I dressing the assembly la Gaelic on on*>
occasion, will take Douglan Hyde's
place and guide the delegation through
; the United States. The recent revival â
j Industrial and educational â in Ireland
I has convinced the Irish people that the
I educational system provided for them
by England is rotten, and the Irish
teachers at their own expense aro go
ing to travel In search of knowledge
for the benefit of the rialng generation.
! The delegation proposes to visit New
York. Boston. Philadelphia. Chicago
and Washington, aad. If their funds
can stand out. they will go to Toronto
and Montreal.

tnl out this following, and that the large op
trators were the first to detect this movement
and follow It Instead of belnÂ« left to hold the |
bap.
COFFEE â Trading was In good volume in i
ihe coCee market to-day, but mostly In the
::ature of switches from the May delivery to
other options. During the oXternoon Quit* a I
croad developed, and this caused an improve- |
ment of 5 points. One of the features was the
r?pcrtcd eurpension cf Karl Krische of Santos; j
but thia was denied by Mr. Krische himself in j
a ca.b!e. CoSed . isltle supply during April

â we record a deficiency In the receipts of other ;
kinds of coffee of about SCO.OOO baÂ«s during

"With only three months of the crop season

into sight and compare It with the quantity '

"The receipts laÂ«t year ax Rio and Santos '
from April 1 to June SO amounted to 572.000 !

"We cellmate the total Into Eight mave-

Further details of the recent movement in
er>oÂ». prunes came to the surface yesterday. i
A 1 told, It was reported, about 400 tone of
c-_ aligned Block changed hands, some of It
gf-ing for exiKjrt. The purchases made by
th*- home trade, as previously noted, were ]
mostly in lots of one hundred to five hun- |
ored boxes, and the prices paid were ex
trm.e-y lew, most of the stock, which em
braced all size* frcÂ»m 4Os to 90s, inclusive,
seiUss; or. ale i. o. b. New York basis. The
bulk of the rtock was of Inferior quality,
thiuph there was some nrst-ciaÂ£B fruit in
cluded in the sales one lot of 500 boxes 60-60s
in i'.i-ib boxes being spoken of as fine Santa
Clara stock. Thla. too. was soM on the
bails of lc f. o. b. New York. Whik these
purchases have moved into consumption sev
eral blocks ot consigned prunes that, have been
pressing on the rr.arket for some time, the re- ;
tireinent of that quantity does not eeem to
b&ve had any strengthening influence upon
the market, there being; too much etock here
which the holders are anxious to dispose of
and which they find great dlfflculty in ln
ttreeting buyers m. even at extremely low
prices. The raisin market was dull and prices
were more or less nominal. Currants on the
c;ot are weak and prices have fallen below
a jjerJty with the low quotations on prompt
shipment etock cabled from Greece. Bait flgt
are getting scarce and the market is firm
and slightly higher. 4%e being quoted as aa

â¢ordinary activity and prosperity in the iron
and eteel trade. But this Is not a new devel
opment, nor is there any immediate new fea
ture in the situation in that trade. It wa9
inferred, therefore, that the suddenly aggres
sive tone developed by the etock was due to
the formation of a speculative party for the
conduct of market operations rather than to a
spontaneous spread overnight through the coun
try at large of a desire to buy the etock. The
preliminary rise in London and the important
buying of the stock here carried the impression
that the campaign has its ramifications abroad
as weil as in this country. The obvious na- '
turÂ« of the ooeratlon did not ! have a deter
rent effect at all on the sympathetic Influence
of the movement on the rest of the list. It
. has been a matter of discouragement among
, the epeculatlve element for some time that the
L nited States Steel stocks were neglected and
comparatively unresponsive to the unprecedent
ed trade conditions In that industry, the effect
j being to suggest some unknown condition back
of the euperflcial situation which might prompt
; ultra-conservatism on the part of the Insid
| ers In the corporation. The relief afforded
; by to-day's development from the dampening
effect on the general list of the sluggishness
ot the bulky and unwieldy steel lesues wae
very quickly manifest throughout the mar
ket. The purpose of the $100,000,000 increase
in Union Pacific preferred stock was as much
a mystery as when first announced, and the
wide range of conjecture on this point was a
potent influence on the speculation in various
stocks. The conviction is general that tho
acquisition of control of another railroad sys
tem Is In contemplation, but the identity of
the railroad intended shifts constantly in the
surmises current in the market. St. Paul and
Atchieon were both pointed to at different
periods to-day, while the New Ycrk Central
hypothesis suffered some decline by the drag
, glng effect on that *tock. The coming lead
merger, which is now generally accepted, was
: a stimulating factor in the 6tocks immediately
; affected. The movement In the Southern group
: of railroads was helped by the great growth
; In the cotton movement and the encouraging
I reportc from the winter wheat crop were a
â  supporting factor In the general market. The
gradual *-artng of the money market encour
; aged a faith of the upeculative element that
; there is plenty to go around for all their
; purpoees. The announcement of a call for 50

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
Future Grain and Provisions. I
I CHICAGO, April Strength of the May op- 1
tlon was the main factor in the wheat market
at the opening. Initial quotations on that de
livery were up lc to l%c at $1 18 to $1 18%.
July was unchanged to He nigher at 88% c to
S9UC-" Another factor.% however, - that exerted *
considerable x influence was a t substantial ad- <
. vance in th* price of wheat In Liverpool.- Thi* :
upturn in May was duo to an urgent demand i
trom shorts. Owing to the congestion In May, |
commission houses showed signs of increasing I
unwillingness to take new trades In that da- '
livery except at unusual margins. A sharp
call for excessive margins Is said to have forced
some of the covering purchases at the start.
It was reported that margins as high as 20
cent? a bushel had been asked. As the session .
progressed the . dread of a sensational advance
In -May resulting from a bun raid as affecting
later deliveries ; began to wear off, . and some
prominent '. local operators who ; had , covered
July wheat as a precautionary measure com
menced to resell. Offerings were sufficiently
heavy to start a decline, which developed : Into
considerable weakness before the end of the '.
day. Poor demand for cash wheat In I all out- .
side markot* had a depressing effect on specu- ;
lative trading here. Additional reports were
received telling of favorable gTowth of the fall ,
sown crop. Late in tho day May wheat 6old
off to $1 17H and July 87% c. The market â¢
ctosed aimost at the lowest point of the day, .
with May %c higher at $1 17% and July %@lc
lower at 87%<&8Sc. - . .
Corn prices declined on profit-taking and the
market closed practically at the lowest point
!of the day. M,Â©VÂ»e lower at 48c. V â !
In oats July closed %c lower at %c. |
Pro-viflons wtre firm early on active buying'
of lard by a prominent pa:ker. -. An easier tonÂ« 'â¢-

YOUNG COUPLE ELOPE AND
SPOIL PARENTS' PLANS.
Cupid triumphed over the ad
verse wishes of parents, when
Merle Lawson, a beautiful so
ciety girl, eloped in an automo
bile and was married in San
Maleo to Lloyd Patterson, after*
the bride's parents had pur
chased a ticket for an ocean
trip for their daughter so she
might forget her affections for
the young business man.
Miss Merle Lawson
Marries Lloyd
Patterson.
Automobile Carries
the Couple to
San Mateo.
Att*r the ticket had been purchased
tor an ocean trip, which was to sepa
rate her from Lloyd Patterson, the
tnan she loved. Miss Merle Lawson, a
local Bociety girl of great beauty,
â¢lipped from her home last evening
and, joining her sweetheart, sped with
him in an automobile to San Mateo,
they were married by a Justice
of the Peace. The elopement has raised
* storm of parental wrath on both
â¢idee, for, although the attachment of
the couple was well known, their mar
riage was stoutly opposed. It was to
Â«nd the romance that Captain Lawson,
the father of the bride, arranged that
she should take an extended sea voy
age, remaining away from San Fran
cisco until late in the year. It was
this projected separation which caused
the young people to put aside conven
tionalities and hasten the wedding.
It was a simple affair. In the auto,
besides Miss Lawson and Patterson,
were Miss Julia Williams, a friend of
the bride, and E. E. Caldwell, a chum
of Patterson's. The quartet lost no
time after reaching San Mateo, for fear
that parental discovery might thwart
their plans. The little group made a
quiet bridal party, and after the cere
mony hastened back to San Francisco.
It was intended to keep the marriage a
t, but it leaked out yesterday.

wages for outside construction and $25,
000 for material.

it would be advisable to have the con
struction work done by contract instead
of the city doing the work. If the work
can be done more cheaply by contract
the committee will recommend that
bids be Invited for the work. Hewitt
agreed to submit an estimate of the
cost of completing the switchboard for
the fire alarm telegraph system. .
The committee denied the petition of
electric fixture dealers that they be ex
empted from the ordinance imposing
fees for inspection of electrical instal
lation. Hewitt explained that the
charge for inspection was very small,
and the committee thought it should be
paid.

The Supervisors' Fire Committee
yesterday reported in favor of amend
ing the building ordinance requiring
in<ioÃure walls of class A buildings to
be not less than thirteen inches thick,
and also requiring fire escapes and
standpipes to be galvanized. The
committee also heard the protests of
a large number of property owners

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 7, 1905
CITY OFFICIALS
NOW AT PEACE
VALL.EJO. April 6.â The tangle in the
municipal government of* this city
seems to be in a fair way for adjust
ment. At a meeting of the city Board
of I'rustees held last night the licenses
of eighty-six saloon-keepers, which had
been held up, were granted. Among
the licenses granted was one to the
Waldorf saioon, which has been princi
pally the cause of the trouble. W. R.
Acock, the proprietor of the Waldorf,
ran the place as a gambling house
when Vallejo was an. open town, and
since the closing of the games more
than a year ago he has been constantly
at war with Chief of Police Standford,
who has attempted to enforce the gam
bling ordinance.
Early in the present year Acock had
himself arrested under the gambling
ordinance and then made a test case of
his arrest. He was successful in hav
ing the ordinance declared unconstitu
tional. Acock then imported a number
of dealers and opened up percentage
poker games. As the City Trustees re
fused to pass a gambling ordinance,
Mayor Roney took another tack and
held up the license of Acock. The Trus
tees refused to grant the licenses to
other liquor dealers and a deadlock en
sued. Then the Retail Liquor Dealers'
Association took a hand in the flght
and forced the Trustees to give licenses
to the other saloons. To save his
license Acock appeared before the
Trustees and promised to take the
poker games out of his saloon. Upon
this promise he was given his license
last night.
While the deadlock was on. Acock
prevailed upon City Attorney Gill to
arrest a number of inmates of a dead
fall who were paying a liquor license
into the city treasury under the guise
of forfeited bail. E. A. Williams, a
member of the police department, who
once aspired to become Chief of Police
and who has since been at outs with
the present Chief and all the other
members of the police department, at
tempted to do some private detective
work for the City Attorney and Acock
and was caught coming out of the
deadfall by the Chief of Police. Upon
being questioned, he refused to tell the
Chief his business. His suspension fol
lowed* but the Trustees voted to rein
state Williams. Mayor Roney vetoed
the action of the board, which still left
Williams outside of his money. Wil
liams then sued for a writ of mandate
to secure his salary and the case was
decided against him by Judge Buckles.
The end came last night when the
Trustees voted to reconsider their for
mer action and then voted to dismiss
Williams. Mayor Roney promptly ap
pointed G. N. Frazer, who has been
serving as a special policeman, to the
vacancy.
There is much satisfaction expressed
here to-day over the results, as it is
now believed that Mayor Roney and
the 'Board of Trustees will bury the
hatchet. Vallejo is planning many
public improvements, and to accom
plish the desired results harmony be
tween all departments of the city gov
ernment must be secured.
DINAN GREETED
WITH FLOWERS
New Chief of Police Takes
Up His Important Duties
Under Happiest Auspices
FRIENDS REMEMBER HTM
Office Is Filled With Fra
grant Blossoms and He Re
ceives Numerous Callers
Jeremiah F. Dinan assumed the of
fice of Chief of Police yesterday morn
ing under the happiest auspices. Early
in the day floral pieces began to ar
rive from his associates and personal
friends, and by afternoon the large
room in the Hall of Justice occupied
by the Chief was more than half filled
with them. They were of all sizes
and designs and formed an exquisite
picture.
Among the first to arrive was a mag
nificent horseshoe, formed of roses and
carnations from the staff in the "up
per office." In the center, in red flow
ers, across a white background were
the words 'Chief; Good Luck!" Most
of the pieces bore the words "Success"
or "Good luck." Two horseshoes bore
the green flag of Ireland with the
golden harp. What gave the new Chief
as much pleasure as anything was a
basket of roses from his little nephew,
Willie Dinan.
"I did not know," remarked the new
Chief as he surveyed the immense iloral
display, "that I had so many friends.
Such an evidence of good will and
friendship will spur me on to do my
duly fearlessly and for the best in
terests of the community. All day I
have been receiving callers, who have
tendered me their congratulations and
I have been kept busy answering the
telephone with messages from friends,
all to the same purport. It is an in
centive to a man to do the best that
is in him."
Captain Spiliane. who has been jper
forming the duties of Chief ever since
the removal of Chief Wittman, will re
main at headquarters up to Saturday,
until the new Chief has familiarized
himself with the duties of the office.
The new Chief joined the force on
April 15, 1888, and on December S, 189S,
he was appointed to the detective
force. He and his associate, Ed J.
Wren, have worked on most of the im
portant cases since that time with
marked success. Chief Dinan is a na
tive son, having been b< m in this city
on January 4, 1865. He learned the
trade of a cooper. He is a member of
Niantic Parlor, Native Sons of the
Golden West, and of the Young Men's
Institute No. 35.
Enjoys Pictures and Music.
A delightful concert was given last
night at the Mark Hopkins Institute
of Art under the direction of Hemy
Hcyman. There was a good attend
ance and in the interval between the
vocal and the instrumental numbers
the audience visited the various roo.sis
and enjoyed the exhibition of rare
pictures. The artists were Miss Laura
Anderson, Miss Mary Coffey. John F.
Quinn and C. F. Hamlin. Otto Fleiss
ner presided at the organ and acted
as accompanist.
To View Scene of Blasting.
The Supervisors' Street Committee
yesterday resumed its investigation of
the protests filed against the blasting
on Chestnut street, near Kearny, car
ried on by Bray Bros, for the Globe
Grain and Milling Company. After
hearing further evidence the commit
tee decided to visit the scene to-day
at noon. In the meantime the repre
sentative of the company assured the
committee there will be no further
grading done on the property.
Le Roy Lee Acquitted.
Le Roy Lee was acquitted by a jury
in the United States District Court
yesterday of the charge of having
knowingly passed a raised ten-dollar
bill upon Mrs. A. J. Vallade last De
cember. The prosecuting witnesses
were positive in their identification
of the prisoner, but he proved that he
was a merchant with an unblemished
reputation. He was defended by Bert
Schlesinger.
Note Draws Big Interest.
A chattel mortgage was recorded
yesterday covering a promissory note
drawn in favor of J. J. Raver by
Glenn C. Barnhart and his wife, Li
zette Barnhart, for $2500. The loan
is to draw interest at 10 per cent per
month and the security given Is the
furniture in the premises at 3731
Jackson street. The note is payable
thirty days after April 6.
Lectures for Church Benefit.
"Twentieth Century Education and
the Bible" was the subject of a lec
ture delivered last night in the Al
hambra Theater by the Rev. Father
O'Brien Pardow for the benefit of St.
Anne's Church. The distinguished lec
turer was introduced by the Rev.
Father J. J. McCue. The subject
proved to be most interesting and was
comprehensively treated.
LARGE OIL REFINERY
TO BE BUILT AT ALVISO
SAN JOSE, April 6. â A large oil re
finery, fed by a pipe line from the
Coalinga oil district and connecting
with a line of oil boats to. San Fran
cisco, is to be built at Alviso. The
Independent Producers' Union P,ipe
Line Company purposes to lay a pipe
line from Coalinga through Fresno,
thence to San Benito County, where it
will connect with the oil producing
section of that county, and enter San
ta Clara County where the Monterey
road crosses the line between Santa
Clara and San Benito counties. The
line will extend straight through the
county to San Jose and from here to
tidewater at Alviso. Pipe eight inches
in diameter will be buried eighteen
inches in the ground for the entire
distance. Several pumping stations
will be built along the line to carry
the oil over the mountains, one or two
of which will be in this county.
An oil refinery of large capacity
will be erected at Alviso. A line of
steamers will ply between Alviso and
San Francisco to transport the oil to
the factories In the latter place.
WILL CONSIDER
A LAND SCHEME
Federal Authorities Are
Told of a Round Valley
Plan to Get Good Coin
LA>I>S ABE NOT OPEN
Surveyor General Declares
That Xo One Has Present
Authority to Sell Them
Federal authorities are about to
investigate certain transactions in
lands in Round Valley and at Covelo.
Information has been supplied to the
office of the United States Attorney
for the Northern District of Califor
nia in which the names of Chat
field & Vinzent, real estate dealers of
this city, and C. H. Goldberg of Co
velo are mentioned.
An advertisement has been run in
which it was asserted that 65,000 acres
of timber land In Northern California
were open for settlement and that
"the United States Commissioner of
fers the choice of this finely located
body of land under the homestead and
timber act." The advertisement di
rected applicants for information to
the offices of Chatfield & Vinzent, 228
Montgomery street.
According to the information sup
plied to the United States Attorney's
office Inquirers were told that the land
was in Round Valley and that the
United States Commissioner in the
case was C. H. Goldberg. Mr. Gold
berg, according to statements made
yesterday in the office of the United
States Surveyor in this city, has no au
thority to transact any land business
for the United States. He is a Com
missioner to take testimony, under
appointment of a Federal Judge, but
that is very different from being a
Land Commissioner^. This fact has
been ascertained also by intending
settlers.
Additional interest is given to the
situation by the statement of the
United States Surveyor General to a
reporter of this paper that the Round
Valley lands are not open to filings.
They have not even been surveyed, and
it is probable that it will be three
years before the Government will be
ready to dispose of them. In the
meantime there is no one who is au
thorized to place any one on the land
or to make any selection of any land
in Round Valley. When the time
comes the land will be sold, after ap
praisement of sections and quarter
sections, each having a definite price
according to its value.
STEAM BADLY
SCALDS TRAMPS
Special Dispatch to The Call.
RENO, New, April 6.â Two wander
ing tramps crawled into a steam tank
in the railroad yards at Winnemucca
to sleep last night and were so badly
scalded from the steam of an engine
that they are now lying in the county
hospital at that place at the point of
death.
The steam tank is used by the South
ern Pacific Company to clean out the
boilers of locomotives after a trip over
the desert. No engine was connected
with it when the men entered, and they
apparently did not realize the danger
of sleeping in the box of iron. They
had only been sleeping in the tank a
short time when an engine pulled up
to it and turned a stream of steam into
it. The steam was driven from the
boiler with a terrific force, and the
men were thrown through a hole in the
opposite end of the box. They were ter
ribly scalded and were not able to walk
after being blown from the box of tor
ture.

TACOMA. April 6. â After an ac
quaintance of years, two couples mar
ried in Wisconsin have separated, se
cured divorces and have now remar-
ried by exchanging husbands and
wives.
The records show that C. H. Dex
ter and Aloise Dexter were married
in 1885 at Oshkosh. Wis. Xearly two
years ago Dexter obtained a divorce,
alleging that Mrs. Dexter had aban
doned him. Mrs. Dexter was givon
the custody of their children, aged 16
and 10 years, and Dexter was directed
to pay alimony of $30 a month for
three years and $15 a month for the
next three years.
Lucien F. Newton and Blanche
Xewton were married in September.
1894, and have no children. Last
April Mis. Newton secured a divorce
on the grounds of non-support and
desertion, receiving alimony of $20
per month.
The Dexters and Newtons have been
friends for years and separation of
the two families resulted in a new
pairing of whU-h has since brought
about two weddings. Last November.
soon after the expiration of the six
months' restriction provided in the di
vorce decree, Newton and Mrs. Dex
ter were wedded. The marriage of
Dexter and Mrs. Newton was delayed
by their desire to satisfactorily ar
range the alimony requirements of
both divorces.

FIND A SPRING
OF SODA WATER
Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
IMPERIAL, April 6.â lt ia a well
known fact that there is less known
concerning the topography of the Colo
rado desert than perhaps any other
place In Southern California, and yet
no section of the State contains more
curious or more forbiding examples of
the freaks of nature. Among the lat
est to be found is a genuine s<-da
sprlntf. It lies about fifteen miles
northwest of the town of Brawley ami
in a section of the country which is
undoubtedly of volcanic origin. Pm
miles the surface of the ground ia cov
ered with mud hills, some of which are
larger than a good-sized house. They
are uniformly conical in shape and hol
low for some distance from the rim.
There are other evidences of volcanic
action in the ashes, lava and pumice
stone scattered around the sur
rounding country. In one of thÂ« larg
est of these formations, which is some
thirty feet high and about forty feÂ°t
in diameter, is found a spring of clear
water, which comes bubbling from far
beneath the surface. The spring itself
fs nearly twenty feet below the rim ti
thÂ«> mound and its water is carbonated
and also strongly impregnated with
iron, as shewn by the iron rust in the
immediate vicinity of the water. Its
waters are unpleasant to the taste, but
a beverage not unlike soda pop can be
produced by putting lemon Juice or
ethÂ«r acid into the water. It effervesces
with a "fizz " like that produced by
drawing the gas from a soda foun
tain. Samples of the water have been
sent for analysis and it Is the present
intention to make the place a pleasure
resort for the inhabitants of the desert.
