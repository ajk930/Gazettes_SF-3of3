was not molested, but was so badly

TOKIO, June 14.â Deep regret is felt
here over a sad accident that occured
last night to the torpedo laying ship
Taiholm Maru, when Lieutenant Com
mander Oda and I nineteen men were
killed and seventeen wounded by a
mine explosion. Commander Oda was
the inventor of the Japanese mine, and.
by his great activity and skill through
out the .operations before Port Arthur,
had added largely to his reputation.
The Talhoku Maru, at the time of the
accident, .was engaged in laying me
chanical mines close to Port Arthur,
under a hea.y fire from the Russian
forts and torpedo-boats. The damage
to the ship was not great.
Reports from St. Petersburg to tlje
effect that the Vladlvostock squadron
recently encountered a Japanese
squadron -'near Port Arthur " have not
been- verified here and the whole story
is believed - to have originated in the
fertile imagination of a Russian press
agent.
f rectal Dlfpatch to TtÂ» ' CUL
A Russian merchant, who was at
Klnchou at the time of the re
cent battle there and who accom
panied . the Russian army on its
retreat to Port Arthur, has arrived
here on a junk. He says that the Rus
sians had no permanent fortifications
at Klnchou, but simply trenches. The
country' around had been mined, forc
ing the Japanese to take to the water.
When they did so the Russian gunboat
Bobr was taken to the head of Tallen
wan Bay, whence she threw j shells
across the narrow neck of land, kill
ing hundreds of Japanese. The Rus
sians likewise suffered more from the
fire of the Japanese ships than from
the artillery and infantry fire.
CHEFU, June 15, noon.â The captain
of a steamship which passed through

dated June 14, says:
"Yesterday- (Monday), at the battle
of Vafangow, Japanese troops number
ing 20,000 tried to press our flank, but
were discovered. We changed our po
sition, flanking the Japanese, and open
ed a heavy fire. The result is un

The same correspondent in a later
dispatch says:
"To-day (Tuesday) the battle con
tinues. The Japanese have opened a
heavy fire on our center.
- "On the night of June 12, southwest
of Vafandien, the Cossacks came Into
contact with the Japanese and drove
them from their position. We lost
two men. The Japanese losses were
fifteen men and twenty horses.**
The date of the first dispatch does
not agree with the press dispatch from

of which indicate that the battle took
place yesterday (Tuesday), it â¢ is

ST. PETERSBURG, June 14.â Emperor Nicholas has received the following telegram from Lieutenant General Baron Stakelberg, bearing to-day's date: "A battle
began at noon around the Russian position four and a half miles south of the station of Vafangow, the enemy making repeated attempts to dislodge our left flank. The attack
was repelled and we retained our position. The First Regiment, occupying the left flank of our position, sustained severe losses. Its commander, Colonel Khavastounoff, and
Adjutant Sub-Lieutenant DragoslafT Xodochin^ry were killed ; General Gernross was wounded, a shrapnel bullet shattering the right side of his lower jaw, but he remained

LONDON*. June 14.â The. Central
News has received a dispatch from Its

date, saying that heavy firing: bet-ween
the Russian and Japanese vanguards
commenced at 1:40 o'clock this after

of a general engagement. The corre

ing the fight at Vafangow. This un
urually late hour indicates that
authorities attach considerable impor
tance to the dispatch. *
It Is believed here that the Vafangow
affair mav prove to have been quite a
heavy fight! The fact that the Rus
sians held their position in the face
of heavy losses supports this theory,
and It Is believed that it may prove
to have been a severe check to the
Japanese northern advance.
The movement of 3000 Japanese north
of Xuandiansian only adds to the
blindness cf the situation in the north
eastern field of opinions. It is un
questionable that the- Cossacks have
been worrying the Japanese north of
Fengwangcheng and the movement
may be merely an efTort to clear the,
country. At the :yne time it holds
the .possibility of a demonstration
against Mukden, one of the many
roads leading directly east from Muk

Japanese are advancing. The con

The prevailing diseases of Mexico are
of a mild malarial type, easily avoided
by following simple rules of living and
avoiding unnecessary exposure to heat
and rain. About thirty miles from the
coast the altitude is from 600 to 800 feet
above the sea, and in this region the
climate Is exceptionally agreeable.
Here, as elsewhere, one is exposed to
sickness, but if the common laws of
health are observed one will experience
no greater amount of illness than he
would in his own country and live Just
as long, if not longer. â Exchange.

The convention was called to order
by' 'General George W. Goddon of
Memphis, commanding the. Tennessee
Division. The welcoming addresses
were responded to by Lieutenant Gen
eral Stephen D. Lee, who is filling the
untxpuea. term of the late Commander
in Chief John B. Gordon. General Lee
said: . â¢ Â¦
It is a source of Joy to every one of us
when we Bee how prosperous our country has
grown. I think we are convinced now that
(he South Is fully on Us feet again.- In ma
terial prosperity we ha\-e not only reached, but
surpassed the achievements of our fathers.
I hold no view of Southern degeneracy, but
I deplore the Irreparable loss ,to my country
and the coming generation when those splen
did men, the bravest and beet the world
has ever held, went down In. death. ..But it.
!s a great comfort to know that the South
had Â»uch men to lose. It was a revelation
to ourselves. - _ .
" As the close of our days" draws' neaT and"
thÂ£ wojk of upbuilding our country passes Into
yuuntrer and stronger hands, let ua make it
our mission to tell the story. Do not let our
children .and, Â¦ grandchildren -forget the. cause
Tor which we Buffered. Tell it not In anger,
tell It not In grief, tell It not In revenge â tell
It proudly as fits a. soldier. There Is no
fhime In all the history. Dwell on the gallant
deeds, the pure motives the unselfish sacri
fices. Tell of the hardships endured, the bat
tles fought, the men who bravely lived, the
men who nobly died. Your dear comrades shall
live Brain In your words.
The cause In which the blood was shed
will never be lost to us, and the love we
?ave it will not die until the last gray jacket
Is folded and the last gray bead Is buried
beneath the sod.
â¢ SECTIONALISM IS DEAD.
Dr. Randolph H. McKim of Wash
ington, D. C, the orator of the occa
sion, followed. He said, In part:
We thank God that to-day the sun shines
upon a truly reunited country. Sectionalism
is dead and burled. ?
A great destiny open* before America. The
rod of nations' has given her possibilities of
power and usefulness among the peoples of
the globe that are almost boundless. We of
the South claim our part In this great des
tiny. Eagerly and Joyfully we accept our re
sponsibilities. In the opportunities, In the
strenuous conflict, in the conquests, In the
glory of the future of our country. We are
Americans, and nothing that pertains to the
honor; to the welfare, to the glory of Amer
ica, Is or shall be â¢ foreign to us. 'What the
South did In the Spanish-American war Is an
example of what ehe will do In the future
toward working out the destiny of, the great
republic.
NASHVILLE, Tenn., June 14.â The
Jefferson Davis memorial services were
held to-day by the United Confederate
Veterans' .Union. The memorial ad
dress was delivered by Bishop Gailor
of the Episcopal diocese of Tennessee.
For the first time since the organiza
tion was formed General John B. Gor
don, the beloved commander in chief,
whose body rests In Oakland Ceme
tery, at Atlanta, did not preside. That
his presence was sadly missed was
apparent from the frequent reference
to his many years of service' as the
head of the organization and his bril
liant war record.
LEE WELCOMES VETERANS.
When he reached New York last
evening, he says, Forrestel took him to
a place and introduced him to seven
other members of the corporation. Al
most immediately a game which he
afterwards learned was called "Eng
lish faro" was proposed, j and Warren
was assured that he could not lose.
Ten. minutes later, however, he. told the
magistrate, his $5000 had vanished
across the boafd. He then turned. upon
Forrestel, accused him of robbery T and
struck him on the head with a cane.
He was unable to tell the magistrate
where the game was played, and when
Forrestel told the court that he also
had played and lost $3500, the com
plainant was informed that he had no
redress and the prisoner was dis
charged.
"You really came down from Buffalo
for the p"urpdsd of beating Somebody
else," said Magistrate Mayo to Warren,
"and in that case the law does not help
you even in a civil way. That has been
decided by the- Court of Appeals.
There is no evidence- here of a^ crime
and I will have to discharge- the. pris
oner."
Warren told the magistrate that For
restel had told him that a friend of his'
made $20,000,000 in. Wall street and
that the corporation which he repre
sented could be parted from a great
deal of its money providing he was in
sight to play a against
the corporation. Upon this representa-'
tion, Warren says, he drew $5000 â the
savings of a lifetime â from a bank In
Buffalo and came to this city.
NEW YORK, June 14.â That is*-ls

"What 'public necessity* Justified the

by the military Is of Itself sufficient to
show that no evidence has be^n ob

The question of recommending a
national x committeeman may not be
taken up before the delegation arrives
In Chicago, as the chairman suggests
that all the members should be pres
ent when the subject Is considered.
The delegation will also recommend
one of Its members for appointment
on the committee of notification. It
will' be the duty* of this committee to
visit the President and notify him of
his nomination. It Is suggested that
Governor Pardee, for whom the Pres
ident entertains very high rega'rd,
should be designated for this distin
guished duty. . It is also suggested
that M. A. Gunst, on account of ac
quaintance with the chief magistrate,
ought to be recommended. The fur
ther suggestion is made that A. Ruef,
who is about ready to make his first
journey beyond tlffe Sierra, should
have something more than a banquet
to signalize his initial outing.

PRISON BOARD VACANCY.
The fact that there has been since
January last a vacancy on the State
Board of Prison Directors, occa
sioned by the expiration of the term
of President R. M. Fitzgerald, has
given rise to much speculation as to
his probable successor. Governor
Pardee leaves to-day for Chicago,
and it has been thought that in dis
patching various affairs of state be
fore his departure he would name
the new Prison Director.
It was learned from an authorita
tive sources last night, however, that
the Governor will not take up the
subject until his return from the
East. The candidates who have been
most prominently mentioned in con
nection with the place are W. Frank
Pierce of Oakland, State Senator C.
M." Belshaw of Marin County and B.
U. Steiriman of Sacramento.
During the absence of Governor
Pardee the ship of state will be sailed
by Lieutenant Governor Alden Ander
son. It Is understood that the course
has been given to the latter and that
he will not change it. He will be en
titled, however, to Dreslde at j the
meeting of the Board of Resents, to

WASHINGTON. D. C. June 14.âSec
retary Hay haa directed that here
after the term United States Embassy,
Legation or Consulate will give way
to the name American Embassy, Le

This Interesting change is made In
the direction of euphony. It Is a con
cession to the popular usage for years
of the term American Embassador.
The diplomatics representative of this
Government in England has been called
the American Embassador instead of
the United States Embasiador. The
word American is believed by the Pres

more dignified and impressive than
that of the United States, as well as
being more brief. Then, too, there are

The benefits of the 'new service to
Southwestern Oregon will be manifold.
Prior to th? advent of the Breakwater
a trio to San Francisco was a serious
undertaking. It, involved either' the
discomforts of a passage of Indefinite
length on a steam schooner or a flfty
two-hciur journey by stage and rail.
The Breakwater can make the run in
a little more than thirty hours under
favorable circumstances and in /less
than; forty hours in heavy weatner.
The country contributory to Coos
Bay includes some cf the richest tim
ber, and mineral land on the Pacific
slope. With the Breakwater * on the
run a visit tb this" section will have
no' terror for the capitalist in search
of Investment. ' The Breakwater was a
favorite â¢ with travelers for health and
pleasure when New Orleans was her
home port, and as the comforts which
then made her popular have been re
tained," the trip to Coos Bay offers un
limited vacation .possibilities. 1 The.
ocean .voyage can be made in comfort
and within easy reach of . Marshflelds
is a sportsman's paradise.
The country is full of . game and the
streams are well' stocked with salmon
and Â¦: trout. Ducks and other birds are
plentiful and- for the sportsman in
search of big game deer and bear are
there in abundance.'
The Breakwater will leave Howard
street wharf , to-day at 5 o'clock on
her second trip to the Oregon port.
The Mayor of Marshfleld and every
citizen of prominence joined in greet
ing the hew steamer, and during the
Breakwater's stay In port the town
made a holiday. There was entertain
ment on board the Breakwater and en
tertainment ashore, Â»:lth speeches of
congratulation, sp^ecno of welcome,
music, banquets, more music and then
a'good-by that carried with U a wel
come for the next time.
The Breakwater is undoubtedly the
best c-QuIpped passenger steamer in the
coast trade. She has accommodations
for fcrty first-class and twenty sec
ond-class cabin passengers. Besides
having\all the comforts of a first-class
ocean liner the Breakwater is speedier
than anv boat ever before on this run.
On her first trip she made better time
by, twelve hours than the. best previ
,ous trip of other j vessels and more
than a day better than the average
coaster makes the run. The Break
water will make one trip a week.
- WILL BENEFIT COUNTRY.
The steamer was tied up to the wharf
to the accompaniment of music. Every
brass instrument in Marshfield was In
commission and the most powerful
lungs in Southwestern Oregon supplied
the power which filled the . metal
throats of the trumpets with the blasts
of welcome.
John D. Sprecke,ls & Bros. Company's
steamer Breakwater arrived late Mon
day from her first trip' to Coos Bay.
Her return here was like that of any
other coaster, but Captain George Sea
man did not care, for his ears were
still tingling with the warmth of the
welcome which the people of the Ore
welcome with which the people of the
Oregon port had greeted the new
steamer. â¢
The Breakwater's arrival at j Coos
Bay . was the signal for one of the
greatest celebrations the thriving' town
of Marshfield. has eveK: kno^n. , The
ii;auguration;of the newsservice meant
rapid transit Ao the 'outside world and
a good-by to the discomforts of travel
by , steam schooner or the tedium . of
journeying over rocky roads in a high
strung stage coach â the only alterna
tives before the traveler prior to the
coming of the Breakwater. Â»

Vincent Kerens, in an interview, ad
mitted the genuineness of the note, but
declared the paper was non-negotiable
and that under the law Sheedy could
not recover on it. The elder Kerens
said that his son fell into the hands of
sharpers and that the note given to
Pierce was the outcome.

Twenty-eight firms or individuals
suffered losses from the fire. These
were: E. Breslauer, the Goldsteins,
Alexander Company, Ophlr Saloon, S.
Ewell & Co., Mercury office, E. J.
Mitchell, Kusel & Son, T. J. Kelly, A.
Howard. Great American Tea Store,

tate, Mrs. A. Ostroski, K. M. Green,
Mrs. John C. Gray and Ophir Hard
ware Company. The fire will not inter
fere with the celebration of the Fourth
of July.
The explosion of a hot water boiler
in the restaurant spread the flames to
adjoining wooden structures. The con
cussion when the boiler exploded broke
many plate glass windows in the vicin
ity and especially those in the front
of the Union Hotel. The flames spread
to the wooden part of the Oroville Mer
cury office, which, like the three places
above, was destroyed. The main of
fice in a brick building escaped. The
fire reached to the north and soon a
row of fine stores were all ablare. The
stores were those of the Goldsteins, H.
Breslauer and E. J. Mitchell. The sa
loon of J. M. McClung was soon de
stroyed. The fire then swept to the
east and caught the two-story brick
structure owned by Mrs. Amelia Os
troski of Â£an Francisco.
In this block were the following: F.
G. Hatch, grocery; George D. Peters,
saloon; Sol Asher, dry goods, and J. H.
Bowers, confectionery and book store.
AH were destroyed or very badly dam
aged. In the upper part of the building
were the offices of Dr. J. W. Wilson,
Dr. E. H. Newbold; Dr. H. J. Graham,
dentist; Dr. Bessac and Fred Estep.
Practically nothing was saved from
any of the quarters. Eight streams of
water were playing on the fire, yet
they were unable to check the flames.
OROVILLE, June 14.â The losses
from this morning's fire foot up about
$129,500, with an insurance of between
$65,000 and $70,000. The fire started in
the rear of the Palace restaurant, a
large wooden building on Myers street,
and before a stream of water could
reach it the fire had reached the rooms
of the Chamber of Commerce and the
hardware store of T. J. Kelly, all situ
ated In the same building.
PORTLAND, Or., June 14. â Because
her father refused consent to their
marriage and debarred him from the
house, Frank Guglielmo, an Italian
saloon-keeper, shot and killed his 16
year-old sweetheart, Freda Garascia,
this afternoon while she. was alone
with two younger children in the
house.
Guglielmo then rushed to his saloon,
took out what money there was in
the safe and started on a bicycle for
Linnton, ten miles away. The shoot
ing occurred at 4:30 o'clock and
Guglielmo reached Linnton before G
o'clock. Meanwhile descriptions of
the murderer had been telephoned to
all surrounding towns. Guglielmo was
known in Linnton and was at once
recognized as the man wanted. " But
there wai no one in the little town
willing at first to undertake the ar
rest. A distress message was sent to
the Portland police and an automobile
full of detectives and plain clothes
men was Immediately sent out.
A fast Northern Pacific train would
reach Linnton in a few minutes and
the murderer was evidently waiting
for this train. The automobile made
a record. Before it arrived, however,
Postmaster J. Z. Alcorn had stolen
upon Guglielmo while he was hiding
in the brush and had secured the
drop on him. He gave up without
further resistance and the detectives
brought him back in the automobile
without trouble. Guglielmo's father
was stabbed to death eighteen months
ago.
Special Dispatch to The Call
This is the second time some of the
members qf the board have been in
favor of making a change, for ' two
years ago at the time of his election
for a term of four years he was chosen
by. a very narrow margin.
A large majority of the board has
joined in a petition asking him to re
sign. On his first refusal the board
fixed the salary of the Superintendent
at $300 per year, commencing with
July 1. \-V;
Members of the board say that
while they like Davidson personally,
they do not like his teaching, or rather
his superintendency, nor his business
methods in the conduct of the affairs
of the School Department. They char
acterize his administration as in
efficient. ,Â¦.:;.'Â¦-Â¦:
Davidson declares that he has some
rights that the board is bound to re
spect and if it does not respect them
he may be able to find a way to en
force respect.
SAN DIEGO,* June 14. â Though

The first number of any American
newspaper was Benjamin " Harris'
"Public Occurrences, both Foreign and
Domestic", published in Boston on De
cember 25, 1690. But the authorities
suppressed it after the .first issue.
Fourteen years later, on April 24. 1704,
James Campbell, postmaster of Bos

ton News-Letter, a weekly newspaper,
-which lived for seventy-two years. The
second American newspaper, the Ga
zette, was printed in Boston, and the
third, the Weekly Mercury, in Phila
delphia. The first New York-news
paper, the New York Gazette,* was es

, The first statement of traffic over the
Chinese Eastern Railroad comes from a
newspaper in Kharbin, and is for the
first eleven months of 1903, during which
1,620.000 passengers were carried and
313,811 tons of freight. Of the freight
32,522 tons were tea and 92,730 tons
grainâ equal to 3,090,000 bushels of
wheat. The freight traffic was 52 per
cent, the passenger traffic 69 per cent
and the gross earnings 55 per cent
greater than the year before, amount-
Ing to $5,612,389, which is (3561 per mile

Agricultural co-operation In market
ing farm produce became a definite,
settled practice In Denmark about
twenty-two years ago, and at present
it has the most perfect system of agri
cultural co-operation in the world.
Denmark is strictly an agricultural
country, densely populated and limited
in area, and the range of intelligence,
taking it through all classes, is per
haps as high, if not higher than. In
any other country in the world. Agri
cultural exports have quadrupled' as a
direct result of the Impetus given to
the production by co-operation, and
Danish farmers are now receiving very
much higher prices for their produce
than any of their competitor^ in for
eign markets.â Exchange.

When sheet glass began to be man
ufactured the thickened part, where
the tube had been attached, was call
ed the bull's eye. Then this term was
successively applied to a lens of glass,
especially in a ship's side, to the lens
of the lantern, to the lantern itself
and finally to the central boss of a
target. â London Answers.!"
Bull's eye is found in the dictionary
of "The Canting Crew" so far back
as 1690, and was \he vulgar word for
the central ring of the target used as
a mark for archers, which was col
ored differently from the other rings.
This may have arisen from - the an
cient rounded shields, cut out of ox
hide and strengthened with a spike or
central boss for this shield or target;
hence target was often used as a mark
itself.
Why is the target's bull's eye so
called? This is one of many instances
in our language where words have
gained a higher status than that with
which they started and have been pro
moted from the slang dictionary to
the dictionary of words of respectable
and current use.

SANTA ROSA, June 14.â Two cot
tagers at Camp Meeker narrowly es
caped drowning Monday and that the
double tragedy was averted is due to
the efforts of Harry Leap, a well
known bowler of San Francisco. While
endeavoring to teach Miss May Brown
to swim, Edward Lawrence and his
companion were In imminent danger
of drowning. Lawrence has only a
slight knowledge of swimming, and
â¢while in deep water Miss Brown lost
her presence of mind and grasped
Lawrence in such a manner as to cause
him to go under the water. â¢ Â¦
Leap saw the danger from the bank
of Upper Lake, at the camp, and went
to the rescue. He seized Lawrence
first, and succeeded in reaching Miss
Brown before she sank the third time.
Her resuscitation was accomplished
only after long and tedious effort and
an extreme nervous condition is the
result of her narrow escape. Leap is
a hero among the campers and resi
dents of Camp Meeker. -~.

In the early days of submarine cables
the minimum tariff was $100 for 20
words and J." for each additional word.
This was reduced after a few vears to
$^5 for 10 words. In 1S72 a rate of $1
a word was introduced. The word-rate
system proved popular and was soon
established universally. Since 1SS8 the
cable rate across the Atlantic has been
down to 25 cents a word, and the tariff
now ranges from that figure to $5 a
word between England and Peru. The
average for the whole world is $1 a
world, and this the Commercial Cable
Company charges from America to the
Philippines, as against the former toll
of $2 Co. From New York to New Zea
land the charge is only -$1 50 a word.
Cable codes are a vital part and par
cel of current business affairs, and
numerous inventors of works of this
character have reaped large rewards
in the last ten or fifteen years. No
commercial house is without its cable
address. Most firms register addresses
with each of the several companies.
Export houses wr.uld be helpless with
out codes. One code word will often
stand for ten or fifteen words, and
there are Instances where one cipher
has been used to represent over 100
words. Practically all commercial dis
patches are coded, and nearly every
line of . business has its special code.
There are COO.000 miles of submarine
cables, enough to go eight times
around the globe. Their cost was about
$200,000,000. Their present value is
$300,000,000. Deep sea cables are a
solid investment. The shortest cable
is one-fourth of a mile in length; the
longest is 15,000 miles. The total num
btr is 1700. Nearly all of the shorter
lints are the property of Governments.
They aggregate 15 per cent of the
tvhole. Private corporations own 420
cables, or So per cent of the total mile
age. The life of a deep sea cable is
from thirty to forty years. The main
portion lies in a bed of ooze two miles
or more beneath the surface of the
water, and is practically imperishable.
In shallow water cables are attacked
by sharks, Ewordfish, sawfish, rocks
and anchors. In the Firth of Forth thir
teen Ehips' anchors were once found
entangled in a length of four miles

CHICAGO, June 14. â Incoming
trains brought large numbers of the
Republican National Convention ad
vance guard to Chicago to-day. Sena
tor Penrose of Pennsylvania was an
early arrival. Others who reached
Chicago were Senator Hansbrough of
North Dakota, Senator Ankeny of
Washington, Judge Judson W. Lyons
of Georgia and Cornelius N. Bliss of
New York. Many persons who are not
members of the national committee,
but who like to be on the ground at
Republican conventions, also came.
The leaders have settled down to a
discussion of the two disputed topics
which will occupy the convention and
the national committeeâ the Vice
Presidency and contasts.
While a number of States will pre
sent contests, Illinois' principal trouble
will lie in the selection of a national
committeeman and the delegate who
will lead his colleagues upon the floor
of the convention.
NEW YORK. June 14. â The Press
tins the following- from Washington:
Alston G. Dayton of West Virginia,
first Republican member of the Naval
Affsi^ Committee of the House, has
been selected by President Roosevelt
for Secretary cf the Navy to succeed
Moody. Dayton is regarded as one of
the ttanchest advocates of a "greater
navy."
Secretary Moody of the Navy will
move into the post of Attorney General
just as soon as Attorney General Knox
is appointed Senator from Pennsyl
vania by Governor Pennypacker and
resigns his portfolio. Moody probably
â¢will serve not longer than March 4 next
end then he will return to his law
practice in Boston, with the greater
prestige of being & "former Attorney
General." That will be money in his
pocket. President Roosevelt feels like
rewarding Moody, who has not found
the Navy portfolio altogether congen
ial.
Within six months after Moody left
the House cf Representatives for the
Cabinet Sr>eaker Henderson committed
political euicide by "declining to run for
re-election. Moody was disap
pointed, for he had been prominent in
the House and would have made a
good race for the Speakership and at
least would have landed in the chair

mittee cr have become one of the Re
publican leaders.
Now that there is a chance to put
him in as Attorney General, a post
thoroughly acceptable to his iÂ»g-al
tnind. the President has no hesitancy
about rtoing it.
Who the next Secretary cf the Navy
Â«i!l be is a question for speculation.
The present Assistant Secretary ot the
d--;,a.rtment. Darling, has been men
tioned, and it Is believed his appoint
ment would be favorably received in
New England. He is a Vermonter and
a man w hose strengrh of character and
decision have evoked much favorable
comment while he has been Assistant
Secretary.

Whereas, Illinois women are an Important
part of the citizenship of the State, bearing
and rearing Us children. 'obeying its laws and
paring ita taxes, we believe that not only
the duties of citizenship, but the privileges
as well, should be exercised by them, and we
recommend that the next Legislature extend
to the women further suffrage lights.
A feature of the platform is that
woman suffrage is approved in the fol
lowing plank:
Lawrence B. Stringer of Lincoln and
Clarence S. Darrow of Chicago were
named for Governor. Darrow declined
to run and Stringer was nominated by
acclamation.
William C. Crollius of Joliet follow
ed in ja brief speech indorsing the
stand taken by Prentiss, and also with
drew his name from the convention.
William Prentiss of Chicago, who
was a candidate for Governor, ad
vanced to the front ct the platform
and declared passionately that he de
sired nothing from the convention,
which did not, in his opinion, repre
sent the Democracy of Illinois, and he
wished for nothing at its bands.
"I decline to have my name sub
mitted to this convention in any man
ner," he shouted, and walked off the
platform, followed by the cheers cf
the Hearst delegates.
CROLLIUS FOLLOWS SUIT.
Pending the arrival of the committee
on resolutions a motion was carried
directing the committee to proceed
with the nomination of candidates for
State officers.
The report was adopted. Chairman
Quinn refusing the demand of the Har
rison and Hearst delegates for a roll
call.
John P. Quinn of Peoria, who presid
ed over the convention both as tempo
rary and permanent chairman, paid
absolutely no attention to men or mo
tions when they did not jibe with the
interest of the Hopkins party, and in
one instance at least he declared a
motion carried before the Hearst and
Harrison people had voted upon it. The
committee on finished its
work early, but it was decided by the
chairman to withhold it until he knew
what action the Hearst people would
take on the report of the committee on
credentials. The report of the commit
tee on credentials said simply:
"We believe everything done by the
State Central Committee in seating and
unseating delegates was just and prop
er, and we recommend that its work
be indorsed."
CHAIRMAN" QUINX A CZAR.
Hearst's campaign managers, who
attempted to ride Into power by the aid
of his name, received absolutely no
consideration from the convention. The
Harrison party, which came solely
from Chicago and was pledged to the
support of Congressman James R.
Williams, was routed completely. Car
ter H. Harrison was unseated as a del
egate and took a train for home with
out going near the convention. Both
his faction and the Hearst party were
as nothing as compared with the
strength and skillful management of
the convention exhibited by John P.
Hopkins. Hopkins will continue to be
chairman of the State Central Commit
tee.

NEW YORK, June 14.â Samuel M.
Burbank of Arizona, a retired mer
chant, attempted to kill himself tp-day
by cutting his throat in a law office.
He is now a prisoner in a hospital
charged with attempted suicide.
Burbank is 55 years of age, and a
brother of Caleb A. Burbank, the resid
uary legatee of the late Ambrose
Brackett Burbank, a millionaire, who
died on January 17 last and who for
several months up to the time of his
death was nursed by Samuel M. Bur
bank. It is believed that Samuel M.
Burbank's mind was affected through
his Â«lose care of his uncle and for some
time his brother has feared such an
outcome as that of to-day. Burbank's
attempt on his life, it is said, also may
be due to the issuance of an order
directing him to appear in court in
connection with the contest of his un
cle's will.
The estate of Ambrose B. Burbank.
has been estimated at from 11.000.000
to $2,000,000 and among several minor
bequests was one of 523,000 to William
F. Burbank, a San Francisco banker,
who refused to take any part in the
litigation over the will.
At the hospital this afternoon it was
said that Burbank's wound is slight
and he should recover from it within a
week.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, June 14.
Police Judge George Samuels to-day
registered- the first conviction in this
city under the compulsory educational
act which requires parents to send
their offspring of school age to school
for at least eighteen consecutive weeks
in the year.
The convicted parent was L. M.
Fickes, father of Lawson Fickes, 12
years old. The arrest was made on
complaint of C. E. Merwin, truant of
ficer of the Public School Department.
At the trial to-day Fickes offered no
legal excuse for his failure to obey the
provisions of the new statute, and con
viction followed without delay.
"This court believes in the letter and
the spirit of this compulsory education
al law," commented Judge Samuels.
"Compulsory education should be en
forced. It is a wise thing for children
and for parents, who are apt to be ne
glectful." '
Fickes will be sentenced Friday.
The site was bought and the building
uai erected during the centennial year
<if 1876. For fourteen years no profit
was returned in,the shape of dividends
to the investors", but since 1SS0 the in
come ha5 been regular each year. Many
Â«>f the stockholders are the lodged' and
other Masonic bodies that meet m the
building. There are also quite a num
ber of individual stockholders.
The association .values the property
at 1150.000 at least, and those promi
nent in its management say the asso
ciation would not contemplate a less
amount than the. higher figure. This
valuation gives ""the stock a' value of
par plus half again. No steps have
l>een taken by the association to take
action in the matter of selling. Some of
the directors stoutly refuse to have
anything to do with it. Others are non
committal. According to one of them
the association was a pioneer in the
movement to erect fine buildings in
Oakland. Nearly thirty years ago it
went to the then- remote corner r of
Twelfth and Washington streets and
erected it? temple. It was a move far
in advance of the city's growth- â¢ Now
when the proposition to move* out of
the old 'building is advanced many
have looked at U aelianoe.;. :'-..';;:â¢Â¦.â¢ ..
No evidence of a desire to part with
their holdings has as yet been mani
fested on the part of the stockholders.
The; property is in excellent condition
from a financial "point of view. The
building, though not modern, is very
eubFiantial. Its walls are more than
crdinaajHy thick and the whole super

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, June 14.
An iron wringer used in drying hides
slowly flattened out the arm of an em
ploye of the Manasse-Block Tanning
Company from shoulder to wrist this
afternoon and necessitated the amputa
tion of the member. The victim was
"Wong Sing, a Chinese employed at the
works for twenty-six years. Sing was
reaching between the rollers when he
touched the device that closed them.
This started the rollers. His screams
could not be heard in the engine-room,
and he saw his arm come flattened out
from the wringer as thin as the hides
he handled without being able to do
anything to save himself.
The rollers closed down upon the
arm close up to the shoulder and they
were at the wrist when the machinery
was stopped. The bones were crushed
and the flesh flattened out to twice the
width of the natural arm. The injure-l
man was hurried to the Receiving Hos
pital, where Drs. R. T. Stratton. R. \l"
Emerson and A. S. Kelly amputated
the crushed member. The rollers had a
pressure of seven tons.

Calculating the cost of raising a per
son in Ireland at K00 â and this .is one
fifth of the supposed cost In the United
States â emigration has cost Ireland
since 1S51, when the statistics were
first kept, about JSOO.OOO.COO. An anti
emigration society-has been started In
Dublin and is doing what it can to
stem the tide of emigration. Its plan
of campaign is to show that while some
of the emigrants do better their condi
tion, many of them do not, and that
these latter almost invariably reach a
lower state of misery than is possible
tn Ireland, where the worst they have
-to fare is poverty, but poverty with
out the moral degradation common in
large cities. This society has arranged
to hold an anti-emigration conference
at the St. Louis Exposition this year ir
the hope that it may do something
among the Irish people in the . Unite*]
States to prevent them in any way as
sisting emigration from Ireland.

throughout the north of Europe are re

art of self-defense. He is a low-down
fighter who in England strikes a foul
blow or takes an unfair advantage of
an opponent. But the Japanese have
elevated the foul blow, and the unfair
advantage to a science. The art of
offense and defense Js to take one's op- <
ponent unexpectedly at a disadvant
age, to fracture his leg. to dislocate. his
arm. or "break -his neck. Frenchmen

had adjusted himself to the situation.

BY OUR REPRESENTATIVES
Strong Contrast With the System In !
Vogue in British House of
Commons.
One of the worst . obstacles to good
government in Washington Is the desk â¢
with which every Representative and
Senator is provided. Not content with
the facilities afforded by this desk for
transacting other business than legisla
tion. Representatives have voted them
selves an office^ building, where ever^
man can have "a room or a suite Â».â¢
rooms for the transaction of his cut- ,
side business, which now occupies i
much more of his time than his Inside \
business.
The deÂ£ks .occupy a great deal of j
room and spread the House of Repre- j
sentati\es over so vast an area that (
only men with exceptional lur.g power)
can be heard. Consequently the bulls j
of Bashan have an unfair advantage !
over men who think hard but cannot |
talk so loud. The opening and shutting i
of the desks is a disturbance. But the
great disadvantage of the desk, the j
private secretary and the proposed of- i
fice are that they encourage the Con
gressmen to spend their time sending
seeds to their constituents, getting per.- j
slons for the friends of men ; T.-ho may
be able to help them, securing increases
of rent of postofSces for in3uentia! men
in their districts and getting more clerk
hire allowance for Postmasters who ;
will see that friendly persons shall be i
elected delegates to the Congressional !
conventions.
In the House of Commons there are
no desks. A man may speak though
he have not the voice of a foghorn, and
the membership of the house is much
larger than that of the House of Rep
resentatives. Members of the former
do not* act as general claim agents and
solicitors for their constituents, and
they have no facilities for doing so.

We had supposed that the hostility
to automobiles signified nothing more
than the hoodlumism of uneasy boys
who have no playgrounds, and who
throw stones and bottles because they
want some outlet for their energy. A
boy was arrested in New York some
time ago for breaking the pictured
windows of a church. When asked
why he did it he answered. "What else
Is there to do?" A chance to play tag
and ball ln a playground would cure
htm of the window-smashing habit, as
it would cure his fellows of the habit
of throwing missiles at automobiles.
But we are assured by the observant
that the enmity of the slum populace
for people who ride in horseless car
riages is founded on something deeper
than superfluous vitality. It is a hate
of the rich, which is encouraged by
the yellow papers, that are owned by
the rich, but edited for circulation
among the poor, whose pennies make
the rich still richer. That there is a
class rather than a personal feeling in
this hostility is betokened by the fre
quency of the assaults. One man re
ports that in a single ride of a few
miles he was attacked no less than
twenty-five times. When a woman was
killed by a boy In the Italian quarter
a few days ago the act was seen by
hundreds of Italians, yet they will not
reveal his place of hiding nor help in
his capture. A community that Is so

THE DAY'S DEAD.
The example set by California and
other States In making the wealth of
resources of its State Library available
to the whole State has lately been fol
lowed, by the State of West Virginia.
The Virginia State Library contains
100,000 books and pamphlets. These are
to be classified and catalogued. The
interlibrary loan system, allowing loans
of books throughout the State, has been
established and traveling libraries are
to be sent out.
Benefactions to Eastern libraries are
not. confined to millionaires. In the
little mountain village of Pine Hill,
N. J.. the summer home of the late
President Morton of the Stevens In
stitute of Technology, a memorial lib-,
rary to their parents has been pre
sented, and will be maintained, by
Henry S. and Quincy Morton. The
cost of the building was $7000.
A gift that is unique in its source
and purpose has just been made to
the Forbes Public Library of North
ampton, Mass. Mrs. Charles A. Cutter,
widow of the late librarian, long prom
inent in library circles, has given a
fund of $5000, the income from which
is to be devoted to the increase of the
librarian's salary. This gift is con
ditioned upon the yearly appropriation
by the City Council of a sum equal to
the income of this fund, that the sal
ary may be raised from $1SOO to $2500.
This donation made it possible for the
library to secure the services of Wil
liam P. Cutter, late of the Library of
Congress, for its new librarian.
In the year preceding the erection of
a $75,000 Carnegie library building the
Cedar Rapids. Iowa, Public Ltbrary
shows a marked advance. Some
changes have been made In the circu
lating department for readers of 14
years of age and over. No guarantor
is now required, only a satisfactory
reference. Neither is a limit placed
upon the number of non-fiction books
Issued to a patron. A trained children's
librarian is in charge of the children's
department, who, with* her assistants,
also has charge of the work with the
schools. A story hour has been estab
lished ln some evenings to draw the
boys from the streets and has been
eminently successful. At Christmas
time a story hour was given each aft
ernoon, attended by boys, ' girls and
older friends. A bird exhibit has been
made a continuous feature for the
year. Beginning with "early spring the
stuffed and mounted birds were
placed by seasons In a case, all labeled
with their common names. Not more
than ten birds were shown at a time
that the children might not be con
fused. This exhibit has proved re
markably attractive. The bird books
placed on top of the case were in con
stant demand.
Action has been taken under the gen
eral library law by the citizens of
Selma. Fresno County, In presenting a
petition to the city authorities for the
establishment of a public library.

Nevada City obtains a site for Its
Carnegie $10,000 building by purchase of
land owned by the county. The lot has
ISO feet on Pine street fronting the
Court House, with a depth of over 70

The experiment of allowing books to
be ordered by telephone and delivered
at any horae for a fee of 5 cents is to be
tried by the Napa Public Library-
San Jose Public Library is to re
ceive the gift of an oil painting of Gen
eral U. S. Grant by Mrs. Brown of San
Jose.
State Librarian Glllis has Issued an
interesting pamphlet of 134 pages en
titled "Libraries' of Calif orniaL" The
description embraces the sixty-five
public circulating libraries which are
Euppdrted by taxation, the fifty mem
bership, technical and college libraries
in tha State, besides a full account of
the different departments of the State
Library. A score of beautiful illustra
tions of buildings give pleasing evi
dence of the growth of library interest
in California. The monograph was pr/
pared specially for use In the State
Library display at the St. Louis Ex
position.
ISSUES A PAMPHLET.
The oft raised question, "Do public
libraries help or hinder the sale of
books?" was discussed at a late meet
ing of the Booksellers' League of New
York City. Fifteen leading librarians
of the country gave their opinions,
which were practically unanimous.
It was shown that the libraries of
the country yearly purchase an Im
mense number of books,\that libraries
are great educators of readers and that
any institution which is constantly
bringing books to the attention of peo
ple must Increase the sales. Many per
sons first notice certain volumes at a
library. Librarians are frequently con
sulted concerning the choice of works
of literature, art, history and science
by those who buy 'for their own use
and for presents to friends, especially
at Christmas time. No opposing evi
dence was given from booksellers; on
the colltrary, a "leading bookseller was
quoted as saying that "the public
library helped him sell books."

Senor Don Luis F. Corea, Minister
"We found evidences on the line of
the canaJ cTf a vast waste of energy.
Of course, much oC this was dv.e. lat
terly, to a lack of funds. It is an Im
mense enterprise, that can only be
prosecuted economically and expedi
tious!}- v.ith --ar-ita! practically unlim
ited. Jt must be undertaken in a large
Â¦way. Here we found laborers throw

Â¦which might be proper enough In. the
grading of a small railroad. We found
machinery lying along the way that
had not been used for fifteen years.
As its contract did not allow it
to quit work, or it could not afford
to wear the appearance of having
abandoned the project, the company
.vas simply putting In the time until
something should turn up either to
jrive it funds or take the job off
its hands.
CLIMATE NOT BAD.
"One of the things anticipated has
turned up. One of the things the com
mission discovered was that the cli
mate \ras not so bad as it has been
painted. We worked there very much
as v e would work in Washington â the
same hours and with about the same
energy. The humidity was not much
more trying than we have found It here
this spring. Of course, we did not re
main there long. As a regular thing
It might be different. However, when
the country Is drained and the mos
quitoes put to rout I think there can
be little complaint made as to
health conditions. This is the first
werk to be undertaken, and that
it can be accomplished in a compara
tively short time I have no doubt. It
will be the aim of the commission to
complete the big work with as small
sacriSca of life as may be possible.
"Now, as to the time to be consumed
and the 'method." continued Grunsky,
'"it is possible, of course, that the
heroic nature of the undertaking may
evolve new means â methods that are
not now anywhere employed. This has
been suggested, and, as I say. it is
possible that machinery more effective
than any we have seen may be intro
duced to speed the work and lessen the
time. Some men have already visited
the ground with the view of studying
the work to be done. I am in favor,
too, of granting contracts in such fig
ures as will warrant the contractors
in equipping themselves properly. A
big contract will offer an inspiration
to the right men. But I may say that
It will be a full year before we will be
ready to let contracts. There is much
to be done "before that. There is every
thing in knowing just what we are
going to do before we begin to do It.
The first real work of the commission
is to make certain of that. In the
meantime, of course, we can 'clean up'
the car.al rone and make the years of
labor there as healthful and comfort
able as possible."

problems to solve incidental to the

To bÂ« sure every one admits the canal
should be at sea level, ultimately.
Whether it should be undertaken with
that end at the start and. if not, the

termined. To cut the isthmus to the

The somewhat astonishing exploits
of the little Jap against the big Slav
lend interest to the equally astonishing
explanation of a noted representative
of the former, now in this city, as to
how the brown men were dwarfed.
Hon. Masatomo Isoda, assistant com
missioner of Japan for the Government
of Formosa to the St. Louis Exposition,
called oi the President to-day. In an
interview afterward Isoda referred to
the fsequent use of the term "little" as
applied to his countrymen. He said It
had come to be applicable onlv since
the present generation, for formerly
the Japanese were of full stature with
other men and as stalwart. With the
revolution of 1S6S the Japanese under
took to forget their Oriental character
and limitations and to acquire the
knowledge of the Occident. They
turned to study with such concentra
tion and diligence and under such
handicapping circumstances that, while
they advanced to the front line of pro
gressive nations within the generation,
they also deteriorated physically with
in the same time to their present
stature. Isoda affects to believe it most
fortunate that a class of athletes and
professors of the jul-Jitsu survive to
teach their fellows the way back
whence they came. "As the nation has
awakened to its defect." he says, "and
as the Japanese never do anything
half-heartedly, he predicts that It will
be but a short time until we see them
measuring up with the rest of man
kind actually and physically just as
they have grown ln the general estima
tion since the breaking out of hos
tilities over there at Port Arthur. Xor
does Isoda so much as crack a smile
In this relation nor give any other
sign that he Is the Bill Nye of his
country.
The tariff Is to be an issue in ttiis
campaign, but any leanings toward a
reduction of the schedule or even to
the beneficent properties of reciprocity
and commercial unions will probably
be found Ln the Democratic platform
alone. What the Chicago convention
has to sav about it will hardlv be in
line with Mr. Hitt's resolution and this,
it is said, is why there is not so much
heard concerning him of late as the
man especially designed for the second
place on the ticket.
At first it was said that Roosevelt
â¢wanted a young man on the ticket
with him. And with this the names
of a dozen more or less prominent
men have been discussed hailing from
all over the Middle West. But the ex
planation as to why Hitt would not
do â or may not do â has been slow to
arrive. It appears now in a resolution
he introduced in the House in 18 99
having for its purpose commercial
union with Canada. The tariff ques
tion was under consideration at that
time and reciprocity was much in
vogue. The resolution was, a little
more advanced on that line than Mc-
Kinley had sanctioned in any public
utterance or than Dingley was known
to have.
Minister Corea says there is commer
cial and industrial activity in his coun
try almost unprecedented, and he at
tributes it largely to the elimination of
the canal from the consideration! of Its
people. The canal, he says, has *been a
will-o'-the-wisp, which worked harm
by distracting enterprise from t other
Selds. When the decision was made in
favor of Panama the Government
promptly and manfully turned to the
building of railroads as the next best
means of developing the resources of
the country. The result. Minister Corea
thinks, wta be even more beneficial than
would have been the building of the
canal.
When the name of Robert R. HItt
of Illinois was sent out some weeks ago
as a Vice Presidential probability it
was hailed as the end of a quandary.
Half a dozen good Republicans prop
erly located on the map had been
discussed before him, and all had
played diffident. They didn't want it.
But that very diffidence made them
less eligible, for the running mate for
Roosevelt must not want for ginger and
enthusiasm whatever else he may lack.
It was just after he had paid a visit
to the President that Hitt was asked
by a newspaper man what he thought
of the Vice Presidency as an office and
an honor, and he promptly declared
that he thought very well of It In both
regards. As Hitt stands well as a
statesman and high in the councils
and esteem of his party, this declara
tion was deemed as just about essen
tial to his nomination and election.
The fact that he had been visiting the
President before he allowed himself to
be quoted was taken, too, as a cer
tificate of Roosevelt's good will toward
him. But as the days have followed
one another it Is noticed that the
question as to the Vice Presidency is
raised again and repeated with a
growing frequency.

THE Board, of Supervisors of Shasta County ind
the Merchants' Club of Redding are working to
gether on a plan of some considerable extent, hav

large scale. Streams that run through the county, in
cluding the Sacramento River, the Pitt River, the Old
Cow Creek arid Clear Creek, need new bridges, and it
is proposed to supply these. Shasta County is moun
tainous and requires good roads available, with the mini
mum amount of interruption, the entire year. Equally
are the roads engaging the attention of the Supervis
ors and the Merchants' Club.
It has been the proud boast of Redding that it is

for the plant of the Mountain Copper, Company at Kes

The situation in the Far Eastern war has resolved

quite naked, save and except one spot
on its back, where there was a tuft
of white hair. It was common to say
that the naked bear came around to

purpose of producing: the same effect

r Art and Matrimony.
An Interesting story is told by the
London correspondent for the New
Ycrk Herald. Recently a sale was had
of the art collection of the late C. H.
T. Hawkins. The Herald correspond
ent, referring to Mr. Hawkins, says:
"Though a great art connoisseur, he had
no idea of the effective arrangement
of his treasures. In fact, they were
distributed about his house in the most
haphazard fashion. Priceless antiques
were to be found In odd ocrners, while
masterpieces of painting stood stacked
on the floor or with their faces to the
wall. This disorder gave rise, some
years ago, to a curious Incident. In
hie domestic menage there came a time
when the overflow of the treasures
prompted Mr. Hawkins to suggest to
his wife that she should stay one night
at a. hotel in order to avoid the in
convenient want of space which a new
consignment, arriving that day, had
caused. She acted upon the sugges
tion, nor did she leave the hotel for*
the following sixteen years."
BECAUSE of the publicity given to railroad acci
dents and casualties at sea we all get in the habit
of thinking that they constitute a great majority
of the injuries suffered by people whose names figure
in the annual chapter of accidents. It happens that the
very general use of accident insurance furnishes the
means of getting accurate statistics that reveal the cause
of accidents. The president of one of the largest acci
dent insurance companies has given the statistics. ,By
these it appears that only 4 per cent of the accidents oc
cur on railroads and less than 1 per cent on steamships,
while nearly 25 per cent of accidents occur to pedes-"
trians, nearly 19 per cent indoors and at home and near
ly 16 per cent at home outdoors.
These latter classes of accidents do not reach great
publicity and are not taken into account by the readers
of newspapers. From these statistics it appears 'that
traveling on foot is more than six times as dangerous
as going by railroad and about twenty-five times
more dangerous that traveling on steamships. " A
man is more than four times safer on a train
than in his own house. The bicycle accidents
are about the same percentage as those on
railroad trains, and streetcar travel is nearly as danger
ous as that on steam trains. The accidents by horses
and vehicles are nearly 19 per cent, or moreJthan four
times in excess of those by rail. The natural horse is
more dangerous than the iron horse though there is
not as. much said about it. '
It would appear from the figures that if a man want to
be real safe and come- out sound he should live on a
railroad train in preference to staying at home, cither in
doors or out. Walking is the most dangerous of all
means getting around. There are people who will
not start on a railroad journey on Friday. So they go
on foot and suffer for it. Among the minor causes fire
arms and bites of animals are about the same, a fraction
over 1 per cent. Yet we would say, offhand, that gun
powder causes a much larger number of accidents than
any bites.
The subject, from the standpoint of the accident insur
ance companies, is very interesting to the public. The
fact that rail and steamship travel cause such a small
percentage of accidents will be reassuring to the timid
people who make a will before.. they buy a railroad
ticket or go down to the sea in ships.

The Night March.
A. G. Hales, the war correspondent
for the London Daily -News, sends
Irom Tokio to his paper a piece of
vivid descriptive writing which Is by
far the best that has come to print
during the present war. It follows:
"It was about. 8 of the clock when
the great sight began. The night had
come on with sudden darkness, not a
Ftar lit the black mantle that over
hurg the world, there was no moon
and the shadows cast by the dwellings
In the unlit streets were scarce darker
than the surrounding void. A mag
netic calm had fallen upon the capital
as if the j>eop!e were gathering them
selves together for one great patriotic
effort. Suddenly the scene was
changed. The tramp of armed men
rarur out upon the night. Short, 6harp
words of command, spoken, strangely
enough, in the English tongue, cut
through the clank of falling footsteps,
and then we knew that the Imperial
Guard was on its way to the forefront
of the war. Then the people poured
out of their homes as a river. In the
full of Its flood, pours over Its banks.
They came In rivulets; they came In
torrents; and from every throat went
up a shout of pride, a wild, shrill cry
of welcome and farewell, and through
the ever varying cadences of the.hu
man voices came the reverberating
tramp of warriors* feet, and still the
shadows lay upon the land.
"It was weird, that march In the
night, with the swelling: cheers waking
the echoes, the clank of arms,
shuffling footfalls of the populace, and
ever and anon a bugle's note. Then
once again the scene was changed, ten
thousand lanterns flashed Into view,
lanterns carried on bamboos by men
and lads and boys. Lanterns of every
size and shape; lanterns pure white
or blood red, lanterns gTeen and gold.
Lanterns round, square and oblong â
all carried high In the air above the
heads of the marching men, and as
the troorw passed on each doorway
opened wide, and every doorway sent
a man or boy. armed with a blazing
circle of flame, to swell the throng,
until the very air danced with a blaze
of beauty. Banners held aloft In
â¢women's hands sparkled in the gor
geous gleaming folds of light, until
the gazer's eye was dazzled by the
rainbow hues that had sprung Into be
ing from the very womb of ft e night.
It was a sight to be remembered when
the head grows gray, a sight that none
who saw it will forget, a eight no man
could merely imagine or imagination
invent. Far up above the blackness
lay unbroken, below the earth was
wrapped in shadows, while In between
the earth and eky a blaze of brilliance
lay. The lights shone down upon the
hard, brown faces of the Imperial
Guard and flashed from rifle barrels
Kit Carson's Rifle.
It 13 perhaps not known to all the
world that the rifle of Kit Carson, the
great Western hunter, 6cout and ex
plorer, Is carefully preserved and may
be seen by those who know its where
abouts. At the time of Kit Carson's
death he left his rifle to Montezuma
Lodge, A. F. and A. M., of Santa Fe.
New Mexico, in whose charge It has
remained ever since, an object of great
Interest and very highly prized by all
members of that society. Montezuma
Lodge is one of the oldest organiza
tions of that nature west of the Mis
souri River. It was organized so Ions
ago as 1S49, at which time the ancient
town of Santa Fe was just beginning
to take in 'cart the color of the west
ern-bound Anglo-Saxon civilization,
Fremont's first trip to the Rocky
Mountains was made In 1842. There
were few white men fn all that part
of the West at the time of the founding
of Montezuma Lodge, but Kit Carson
was one of these early members. To
his brothers of the society he left what
may have been one of his most cherish
ed possessions. â Field and Stream.
Perdicaris and Tangier.
The capture of Ion Perdicaris and
Cromwell Varley by the brigand, Rais
eouII. is a matter of more than ordin
ary and personal concern. Tangier is
within five days' journey from London.
It possesses so many natural and cli
matic advantages that its popularity
as a health resort was likely to in
crease more and more. Under the t lead
ership of Ion Perdicaris the European
residents had constituted themselves
into a sort of borough, elected a mu
nicipality and duly procoeded to Im
pose taxes on each other. They used
the money thus collected to build some
sewers, to pave some streets and, In
fact, to introduce sanitary improve
ments which rendered the place more
habitable. Therefore, more, visitors
came, land Increased In value and so
many new and European houses were
built that, had this continued, the pic
turesque character of the. place would
soon have been destroyed. Then peo
ple would cease to go to Tangier and
all this building would have proved
useless and a dead loss. But the Moors
rebelled. They did not, perhaps, great
ly object to the improvements made at
Tangier, particularly as, for the mo
ment, it brought in a golden harvest,
but they could not tolerate European
Ideas at the court of their own Sultan
and in the interior of the country.
Little by little the Sultan has lost his
authority and the crfuntry^has fallen
into a state of anarchy.
It is not probable that even Rais
souli and his wild men would willingly
do Perdicaris or Varley any bodily
Injury, but Perdicaris is not in good
health and at his age the rough ex
istence he will be forced to lead may
produce evil results. Perdicaris all his
life has been devoted to good deed3.
No one qould be more popular among
the Moslem Moors, whom he has de
fended over and over again from the
extortion ut Jew and Christian usur
ers, acting under the cover of the pro
tege system. It will go hard with
Raissouli and his tribe if they injure
him. To the European Perdicaris has
also been a constant friend and the
leader In all practical useful works.
It was Mrs. Perdicaris who organized
the soup kitchens when there was dan
ger of cholera, so that the want of
food should not prepare the way for
the outbreak of the disease. In all
public works that have contributed to
render Tangier clean and healthy, Per
dicaris was the principal initiator and
donor. The cause c-f public health had
in him its first and most useful cham
pion, while in regard to the cruel
abuses practiced under the protege
system he has been Instrumental In
bringing about reform.
'A Disgusted Ruler.
The administration by Prince George |
of Greece of the island of Crete as j
governor general, nominally subject to !
the Sultan, but in reality the appointee
of the great powers, and which was
inaugurated under the, most auspicious
circumstances five years ago, with
every prospect of success, has resulted
in a dismal failure, and it is probable
that ere long there will be another
Insurrection on the part of the
natives, this time not against the
Sultan, but against Prince George. In
fact, so unpopular has his rule become j
with the Christians, as well as with 1
the Turks, that a short time ago the
Mayor of Canea, which is the me- j
tropolis of the Island, and Professor
Jannaris, formerly professor of Greek
of the University of St. Andrew's, in
Scotland, and one of the leaders and
certainly the most respected of the
Christian residents of the Island,
were thrown Into prison by Prince
George for having addressed a petition
to the Greek Government entreating
that Prince George's brother, Nicholas,
who is married to the Grand Duchess
Helen of Russia, might take his place
as governor general of the, island.
When Prince George heard of this he
was furious and caused the Mayor and
the professor to be arrested and has
had them sentenced to two years' im
prisonment each for 'no other offense
than for sending this petition to
Athens.
The fact of the matter is that Prince
George, who is heartily sick of his en
forced residence on the island, which
he regards as ah exile, and where he
professes to be bored to death, is com
pletely under * the influence of his
Athenian secretary, M. Papadiamanto
poulos, a brother of King George's fa
vorite A. D. C. This man ! with the
phenomenally long name practically
controls the entire Cretan go'vernment
without any regard *o the much
vaunted and elaborately organized
council of the Prince, developing in
this fashion a rule far more autocratic
than that of any Turkish governor
general who ever directed the des
tinies of the island in the name of the
Sultan.

Gutta Percha- Scarce.
The last source of gutta percha de
veloped Is that In the Philippine Is
lands, but here the regions which pro
duce this material for the market are
confined to the islands of Mindanao
and Tawl-Tawi. The method of har
vesting used as present by the natives
consists in cutting down the large
trees, ringing the trunk, lopping off
the larger branches, and then catching
the milk as it flows out. This is very
wasteful, as but a small part of the
milk is secured. Fortunately, how
ever, this process pays only with large
trees, so that the smaller ones are not
destroyed. This method of harvesting
has been prohibited and rules provida
for tapping the trees, but these have
never been enforced. At the present
time the gutta percha trees have dis
appeared from the coast regions and
are along the large rivers.
The various governments with tropi
cal possessions In the East are study

ALEXANDER CRAW, the horticultural quar
antine officer at this port, is in demand in Ha
waii, where the planters want him to stop the in
sect ravages upon the cane plantations. He is offered a
five-year contract at $5000 per annum. Here his pay is
$2400 per year, with no certainty of tenure, as political
changes may at any time retire him from a post' in
which it is stated that he has saved millions to the fruit
growers of California. Our people must revise their
ideas of the compensation of the entomologists and
vegetable pathologists who stand guard over the in
terests of agriculture and horticulture in this country.
Some of our foreign critics have said recently that
while we have great activity of intellect we lack pro
fundity, and are not producing the deep students in
science that are the founders of things ! ,and the pro
moters of the real material progress of the world. Per
haps that is because such students must consider where
with they shall be fed and wherewithal they shall be
clothed. In the two lines of vegetable pathology and
entomology, the student, must depend upon public em
ployment, wherein his income is less than that of a
hodcarrier or stonecutter. But the fact that it is pub
lic employment causes its private beneficiaries to dis
miss all sense of obligation to increase the reward to a
figure commensurate with the vast importance of the
service rendered.
Japan took our best vegetable pathologist away from
us on a long contract at five times the pay given Kim
here in government employ, and now our best entomol
ogist is to be lured from us by a salary more than
double what we pay him. Even scientific men must
pay some prudent attention to their material interests.
They may be sure that when they die we will bury
them with gratifying ceremony and high ascription, and
perhaps erect to them a monument of perishable stone.
That is good as far as it goes, but it is nothing to the
opportunity to live decently, care for a family, and be
delivered from the daily torment of scheming to make
one dollar do the work of two dollars.
Mr. Craw should not leave his post here. The hor
ticulturists should see to it that he does not. In the
certainty of his tenure, and the sum of his compensa
tion, there should be encouragement for others to pre
pare to take his place, when he must give it up. One
mistake in the quarantine office, one day's neglect of
duty, may land here â¢ some pest that will destroy the
fruit industry and all the canning and drying interests
that depend upon it, and work injury to the transporta
tion interests to which it supplies tonnage. The inter
ests at stake* are too great to take any risk.

Touching the Duke.
Special CorrÂ»ipon<ieneÂ«.
HEADQUARTERS OF THE CALU
E HENRIETTA STREET. COVENT
GARDEN. LONDON, June 1.âAl
though the land In the vicinity of
Floors Castle, which the Duke of Rox
burghe is now transforming into golf
links, forms part of his estate, it has
cost him $50,000 to acquire possession
of it for his own use. Sandy MacPher
pon, one of the Duke's Scotch tenants,
held the property in question en a
long lease and Sandy was not born
north of the Tweed for nothing. When
the Duke's agent called upon him with
the view to making some equitable ar
rangement for the relinquishment of
his lease the canny Scot perceived that
the opportunity of a lifetime had come
to him and grabbed it.
He named an exorbitant figure for
the transfer of his holding. The agent
did; his best to beat him down to some
thing approximating a reasonable fig
ure, but Sandy was obdurate. He had
read all about the Goelet millions and,
furthermore, as a golfer himself, knew
that his ten acres constituted the best
available ground for golf links on the
ducal estate. Also, that whatever the
Duke might be disposed to do In the
matter, his American wife would never
be satisfied with anything less than
the best. He finally told the agent
that he would se the -Duke in â well,
Jericho, before he would part with his
lease for a "baubee" less than the price
he had named. This message was con
veyed to the Duke, who, after express
ing some very emphatic and forcible
opinions concerning Sandy, yielded at
last to his terms. It was not the fork
ing out of the money that he minded so
much, for he knows that there is
plenty more where it came from, but
it was being victimized in such a fash
ion that made him feel sore. As he
expressed it. '"It Is very hard that one
cannot get possession of his own prop
erty at a decent price."
The Duke has been an enthusiastic
golfer for some years, but has never
attained to any high degree of profi
ciency in the game. Not long ago he
played with the Laird of Skibo over
the latter's private links, but it proved
to be a case of the old man beating
the boy, much to Mr. Carnegie's joy
and the Duke's chagrin. It was after
this the Duke decided that he would
have golf links of his own and model
them after those at Skibo. Meanwhile
he is taking lessons from a professional
at Berwick. When the links at Floors
Castle are ready he will take lessons
there from the celebrated Ben Sayer,
who has coached some of the most dis
tinguished amateur golfers in the coun
try, including Mr. Balfour, the Prime
Minister.

The truculent Individual on the end
seat of the car hoisted his shoulders
and squared off at the conductor. The
man in the uniform pulled the bell
rope for the motorman and began to
reach under his seat for the switch
bar when the truculent individual
sprang, upon his back and began to
rain blows upon him. Just as the mo
torman started back to assist his fel
low operator somebody started the
car going from the front and he had
to race back to control it. It began
to look bad for the conductor.
Just then a man who had been
lounging on the opposite seat, appar
ently asleep roused himself. He stood
up, stretched his arms with a slight
yawn and then reached over and.
grabbing the conductor's antagonist
by the scruff of the neck, ha lifted him
off the car. The unknown champion
followed after swiftly, delivering a
strong right hook on the jaw of his
victim as he reached the ground. Then
he proceeded to "wade into him." Be

signal for his ally to get on the car.
That powerful individual reluctantly
left his task with a final short jab to
the ribs and swung himself to the car

carried proudly by men called forth
to battle for a nation's honor.
"The lights gleam ruddily on bold,
unflinching eyes and faces fixed in the
stern lines which duty carves and hon
or, glorifies; and as my eyes ranged
over that glittering mass, made up of
men and women, and warm, strong
colored things, nothing looked to me
so grand, so strong, so noble, as the
proud, calm faces of the Imperial
Guard fixed like flint
"Now the dense mass grows denser.
From every alleyway and lane, from
every street and high road, the people
poured with lanterns held aloft, a
dozen feet above their heads^ Then
some one broke Into song. A swift rush
of voices followed, as wave follows
wave upon the coast. Women and
children sang, men danced and tossed
their lanterns high, boys clapped their
hands and sent shrill treble sounds far
out into the night. And yet above It
all, above the babel, of sound, , above
the cheering and the song, came the
stern, strong tread of the men who
were marching to victory or death.
"They swing along with the meas
ured stride of men who knew \yhat
marching meant, each man wrapped in
his heavy jet-black overcoat, his knap
sack on his back, his bayonet by his
side, his rifle on his shoulder, the yel
low facings | showing on each front.
Steadily they moved amid that storm
ing, swaying, fire-girt multitude until
they reached the railway station.
Then, as if each soldier were part and
parcel of a machine, they passed along
the platform into their places. There
was no hurry, no confusion, no shout
ing, no storming, just a low Â»vord of
command at intervals, and prompt,
unquestioning obedience, and every
seat was filled by the man appointed
to fill it; and in a moment, without a
hitch or a blunder, the troops that were
the pride of the capital flashed out
into the night to cross steel with the
gray-clad men from the far-off North,
while the women were left behind to
weep and to work, to watch and to
wait, as women must when war is loose
in the land."
THE reported mining combination to be made by
Mr. Rockefeller takes on much, interest in view of
the financial legislation of the world. Charles
A. Conant, who was the secretary of the Monetary Com
mission appointed by the executive committee of the
Indianapolis Monetary Convention, has just issued a
monograph on the "Evolution of the Gold Standard"
which is of historic value.
The Monetary Convention of 1867, called by France,
in which nineteen nations were represented, declared
for the gold standard with only the dissenting vote of
Holland. The delegate of that kingdom explained that
he differed only on the issue of the time which each na
tion should judge to be necessary for effecting' the
change. The evolution of the standard was on the line
of natural selection. . Cattle were once the standard of
value, and from the word "pecus," cattle, we get "pecu
lium," the Latin term for private property, "peculate" to
steal such property, and "pecunia"* money, and its Eng
lish forms, "pecunius," full of money, and "impecunius,"
without money. From its Spanish form, "pecos," we get
the name of the Texas river and valley, where cattle
ranged.
â¢The next step was the adoption of iron as the stand
ard,, and that was followed by copper, the money of
Rome. Hence, we have "aestimara," "to value," from
"as," the word for copper, preserved in our English
form "estimate." The extension of Roman conquests
brought in- silver, which succeeded copper and was long
the standard. That period is preseryed in the French
word "afgent," silver, one of the terms for money. Gold
followed silver, and has long been the actual standard
of value by natural selection.
There is no evidence that control of production of
either of these standards has ever affected its quantity
or use. Money is of value to its owner only in exchange,
and that exchange puts it within reach and in the pos
sible possession of any who have anything to exchange
for it. The standard will never go backward. A prop
osition to reverse the order and go back from "oro"
to "argent," "as" and "ferrum" to "pecus" again, would
find no advocates in the commercial world.
The discussion is- likely to be renewed again, for the
report of Rockefeller's intentions will no doubt cause
the unsound money advocates to. raise the wraith of a
gold corner to support a contention for the overthrow
of the establiihed standard. Such a course will natur
ally fall in line with the use made by the same people
of the industrial combinations to assault a protective
trriff. The elements are present in the economic situa
tion to renew the assault of 1890 on the tariff and the
su.ndard of value. If that be done it will require the
greatest firmness and intelligence and the most enlight
ened use of reason to prevent some form of panic dur
ii f the campaign.
All expert observers foresaw that the great expansion
of trade that began in 1897 would be followed by a re
action. That reaction is in progress now. Let alone, it is
r.riluial and wholesome. : But if jackdawed about in poli
tics and croaked about on the stump and in platforms,
it may be quickened into a panic. If the Democratic
party have at heart the best interests of the country, its
National Convention should frankly indorse the gold,
standard legislation of 1890. . It had leaders in the past
who were capable of this. That party got off on the
wrong foot in the Civil War. , It lost the confidence of
the country thereby. It continued in opposition to
measures, military and civil, for the restoration of the
Union, and promised to be an irreconcilable force, like
the English non-jurors who refused to accept the action
of the convention of 1688 in giving the crown to William
III.
The man most responsible for this attitude of the
Democracy was Vallandigham of Ohio. He was a for
cible character. His ancestors had bled on the Belgian
plains in the battle of the Golden Spur. He was the
victim of military banishment during the war, escaped
over the lines and made a dramatic appearance at the
Democratic National Convention in Chicago in 1864. and
wrote the peace-at-any-price platform on which
McClellan was nominated. He seemed the least likely
of any man to accept what others saw to be inevitable.
Yet he lived to write the Dayton platform, without re
serve accepting the whole results of the war, the re
stored Union, the abolition of slavery and all.
His position in the party is now held by Mr. Bryan.
If that gentleman would move in the St. Louis conven
tion to accept the gold standard, declare for its neces
sary collateral, the flexible banking system and expan
sion of currency to meet the fluctuating necessities of
credit and abandon his past theories, he would relieve
the Republican party of the burden of sustaining alone
the public and private credit of the country, and would
clear the field for discussion of other subjects in the
year's campaign. Will he do it?
passable â there may be seen a multitude of vehicles,
piloted by skillful teamsters, en route with freight of
all kinds. Towns and hamlets many miles distant await
the arrival of the teamsters and the wares that are in
their charge.' Prompt and certain communication de
pends on keeping up the condition of the country roads
and the safety of bridges that span large streams. The
people of at least two counties â Shasta and Trinity â
are directly interested in having the facilities for travel
as good as they can be made.
In addition to the bridge and road programme the
Shasta County people are also concerned in providing
themselves with a hall of records, to stand in Redding.
Every Grand Jury in Shasta County has recommended,
during a series of years, that such a building 'be pro
vided. A bond issue is now proposed to raise the
necessary money for the several improvements that are
recommended. The Redding Free Press, says that the
prospect is good for putting Shasta County "on a foot
ing with other prosperous and progressive counties of
California."

As a last plea Mr. Kellogg said that
if the injunction was denied it would
mean that the company would be con
demned before it had been tried.
This morning the application of the
Contra Costa Water Company for an
Injunction against the city of Oakland
will be heard on the same plea as the
case Just submitted by the Spring Val
ley company.
The cost of supplying water in the
Eastern cities and in San Francisco
was ccmoared and the climate and
ether differences were explained. One
reservoir of the company would be suf
ficient in the East to supply a city ten
times the size of this, but here many
are needed, but the difference was not
considered by the board when it figur
ed en the company's property. All the
company asks for is Just compensa
tion, and that the proposed rate would
not srtve.
Mr. Kellogg lamented the fact that
all the wisdom exercised by the com
pany for the improvement of the water
supply had been turned against them
and resulted in a detrimental public
estimate of the holdings of the com
pany.
Mr. Partridge claimed that the com
plaint cf the company was an implied
threat to shut off the water from the
city unless the rates established in
1302 were allowed to etand. He be
lieved the court should take that fact
into consideration as an issue wherein
the community was under stress.
All cf the points presented by the
company through affidavits and by the
law cited by Mr. Kellogg were gone
ever and Mr. Partridge asked that the
injunction be not issued.
Mr. Kellogg contended that the mon
ey involved and the ultimate results
required an answer by the city, wftich
had not been given and, further, the
injunction prayed for should be grant
ed. The affidavits presented by tha
city were criticized as unreliable, while
these furnished by the company were
from men who were In daily touch
'.%ith the business affairs of th? com
pany and knew whereof they fpoke.
In the matter of revenue, he sa!d the
company would not be eatteilel with
an income of five per cent on its in
vestment, as figured by the Boar I of
Supervisors, for that would practically
put the company out of business. The
company is entitled to as much pro
tection as any individual, but under
the rate prepared by the Beard of Su
pervisors it would not get It.
LA3IENTS PUBLIC FEELLN'G.
At the morning session Assistant
City Attorney Partridge continued his
argument. He contended that the peo
ple of San Francisco rather than the
Supervisors were the real defendants
in the case. The history of the Spring
Valley company had been ens long
series of attacks upon the statutes of
the State and particularly upon the
ordinances cf San. Francisco, hence the
application for the injunction should
be considered with that fact in view.
COMPLAINT IS THREAT.
Final argument in. -the case close^
yesterday afternoon when Attorney
Kellogg, for the company, made the
last address. The court stated that the
case would be taken under advisement
and an effort would be made to ren
der a decision at least two days prior
to the going into effect of the ordi
nance regulating water rates. Mr. Kel
logg requested the court to fix the date
cf handing down the opinion so as to
give the company ample time to fur
nish bonds, in the event of the injunc
tion being granted. The court said
that would be done.
A few days before July 1 Judge Gil
bert of the United States Circuit Court
of Appeals will hand down his deci
sion regarding the application of the
Spring Valley Water Company for an
interlocutory injunction to restrain the
city and county of San Francisco fremi
enforcing the water rates adopted by
the Board cf Supervisors for the year
beginning July L
Alâoet the whole cf yesterday in the
Eppirper case was occupied with ar
g-umert regarding the admiasibUity cf
data contained in one book. The argu
ment tegan before the noca adjourn
ment and. as it seemed endless, the
court excused the jurors for the after
noon session. Authorities were Quoted
freely. The court reserved its decision
ustU this Ecmirg.
The adrr.lgsicn cf this disputed evi
dence is strongly desired by the prcae
cutlcn. The bock in question Is a rec
ord cf the report of the deputy grain
inspectors made menth by month to
the chief Inspector showing the quan
tity of grain In the warehouse at
Crockett. The defense contends that
Â£Â£ this statement is merely a copy
n-.ade by a second party the witness
who znade th? crigir.al may net be al
lowed to- refresh his memory from it.
The prosecution en the ether hand
holds that such & reccrd is as authen
tic as a typewritten transcript cf a
shorthand reporter's notes.
Henry C. Bunker, chief grain exam
iner fcrr^the Merchants' Exchange, was
<:n the s'tard again yesterday morning.
He was asked as to the custom cf
warehousemen regarding receipts after
:~e grain had been delivered, but could
r.ot tell what became cf the receipts.
They should be canceled, he said. The
question was put to him in various
i~Tzr.s, but *,'.* answer remained un
changed.
Charles A. Gee was next called. It
oraj during his examination the ques
tion ef admitting the table prepared
by Bunker arose. Goe testified that he
had been employed for several years
as a deputy grain inspector and was
familiar with the warehouses at Crock
ett. He inspected wheat Tn the ware
houses almost daily, but could net tell
of the conditions existing en any par
ticular day without referring to the
tabulated statement made out by his
chief. Bunker.
During the afrerriocii the old ques
- - regarding the 'whereabouts cf the
warehouse books again bobbed tz^ and
was as usual the cause of a tilt be
tween opposing counsel. Campbell di
rectly accused Ach cf having had ac
cess to- the bocks. To this Ach re
tcrte-i spiritedly that he had net.
"Well, at any rate," said CampbelL
"the defense has seen the books and
knows where they are."
"Well, if we do, we never mad* any
threats to send any cse to Jail en
them." was the retort.
".Neither did I." promptly interjected
District Attorney Byington.
This dosed the incident cf the grain
bocks for the time and the court an
nounced that an opinion on the ques
tion at issue would be rendered this
morning.

SAN FRANCISCO.The controversy over the granting of
a license to the Turtle saloon was
again the subject of much discussion
at the meeting of the Police Commis
sioners last- night. T. J. Crowley, the
attorney for McNamara and James, the
owners of the resort, became excited
while pleading for his clients, and after
announcing that he had had just as
many drinks at the St. Francis as in
any other place, he suddenly addressed
Commissioner Hutton, saying: "You
know that you and I have been drunk
together and we didn't get It in the
Turtle." .
Hutton demanded a retraction of the
speech and Crowley made It. The sub
ject went over for another week.
Policeman Felix F. Dougherty was
fined $100 for taking a drink in a saloon
while on duty.
Paul Q. Smith, a non-union hack
driver, was* granted a license.

Cabrera combines modesty and affability tn.
gether with the highest degree of Intelligence
and energy. He is a man well fitted to bÂ»
to Guatemala a second Porfirio Diaz, and tha
progressive element is very enthusiastic in giv
ing him its support.
The. American newspapers have already given
the Important details in regard to the con
cession obtained by the American syndicate
of Home & Minor Keith, which has for its
object the constructing of the Northern Rail
road, which is to connect Puerto Barrios en
the Atlantic side with San Jose on the Pa
cific shore. This road Is of the utmost Im^
portance. It reduces the distance between
New York and Chicago to one week.
Since Don Estrada Cabrera has taken hold
of the reins of the civil government the era
of the Guatemala revolution has ceased. Ths
greatest part of the dissatisfied element has
gone to work and is now enjoying peacefully
the fruit of a steadily progressing and pros
perous country.
The re-election of President Cabrera in July
seems to be pretty well assured, and as he
Is a man of such energetic mind and action,
which he knows how to apply if necessary the
country is bound to steadily develop under
his administration.
The salvation of all the Latin American
countries lies certainly in the direction of
work and not In Dolltics.
The smaller native farmers hare been
obliged to sell most of their product to pay
expenses, interest and mortgages, and as cof
fee prices ruled low for several years this
meant a contraction In the returns for natural
products as well as a shifting of balance,
for which, however, the Government cannot
b? held responsible.
The last year's revenues amounted tn $17 .
5S*5,StH 70. against expenditures of $17,004
03{* 46, national current-}', in this connection
it is of interest to note that the present Gov
ernment paid out during the last six years of
Its administration $::.Â«M.4lf> IÂ» in gold and
$75,K>2,461 7:'. in national currency, of which
$2,513,152 ."!Â« gold and $12.691. (Ml paper money
must be chanced to compromises made by the
previous Government.
The crop of 1004 and 1^05 promise* to b*
a most bountiful one. and the tineas, which at
first owing to the excitement were considered
totally ruined, have been recovered and Im
proved to such an extent that it really may
be called marvelous. Thus the damage to Um
previous crop, which was partially lost, and
the losses caused by the destruction of budd
ings will be more than equalized by the re
alization of the good prospects for this year.
During the period of 1898 to llMXi the balance
In favor of export compared with import*
amounted to $20,932,315 6Â« gold, and the trade
balance was In favor of exportation. In fate
of this it may be natural to ask why the crisis
lasted such-* Ions time. In answer to thN
it must be stated that one of the reason* is
the fact that most of the business and ths
most productive coffee plantations are heM
by foreign people and that the value of their
products goe9 to foreign countries with the ex
ceptlon of what little U needed for the sup
port of the flncas, for personal expenses ant
for exDOrtvduty.
San Francisco has so many and far-reaching
commercial interests and relations with this
republic that tha people should have a clear
understanding cf the situation by strictly im
partial and reliable accounts. Like most of
the Latin American republics our state ex
perienced within the last few years a suc
cession of depreoslons, and the crisis waa tha
more Intensified because of the influence of tha
low coffee prices and the terrestrial disturb
ances well known to all of us.
We frequently receive papers from San
Francisco bringing notices and reports on con
ditions of things in Guatemala which are the
very opposite of truth. Not long ago a. monthly
journal published in the Spanish language ?alj
such queer things as to almost cause us tu
smile were It not for the fact that they were
grossly slandering to this country. It is always
unfair to attempt to influence and set public
opinion against a country by reports which
are caused by spite and selfieh motives even
If the author, as in the above case, had the
misfortune there to get stranded in bia com
mercial enterprise.
According to a letter written by
Ricardo Franz, Consul of Portugal in
Guatemala, to Henry ilohns of this
city the affairs of Guatemala are by
no means in so bad a condition as ha3
been reported. The letter says:
Portugal's Representative at President
Cabrera's Capital Predicts Pros
perous Future for Republic.

A feeling of gloom pervades the
training camp in the Lake County
mountains, as all Jeffries' followers
expected him to be in the finest pos
sible condition on Friday night, when
he was to have defended his title to
the championship. Once Jeffries'
injured knee takes a turn for the bet
ter the gloom will be dispelled.
Out at Munroe's camp training op
erations were at a standstill. The big
miner has been keyed up, mentally
and physically, for a supreme effort
on Friday night and the sudden let
down has had Its effect on him. He
will resume work again to-day, al
though some of his advisors believe if
he took matters easy for the balance
of this " week it would be the best
thing he could do. Four rounds of
fast boxing each day would keep him
keyed up and there would be but lit
tle danger of overtraining. Owing to
the amount of energy he puts into his
work there is always a possibility of
his overdoing it.
Munroe's work hereafter will be di
rected toward the development of
speed, both in boxing and in foot
work. He will do a lot of short
sprints on the beach and will also box
Â¦vnth the cleverest men available,
liunroe's improvement has bordered
on the sensational and Trainer Tim
McGrath will endeavor to keep up the
good work during the next two weeks.
This may help Jeffries to decide
upon coming here at once. In this
case he will settle down at Oakland,
v here his knee will be given whatever
treatment is necessary. Jeffries would
then train at the Reliance Athletic
Club.
Dr. Devening. the physician who Is
intending Jeffries, announced that
there was water on the knee and that
it would have to be tapped. Whether
this will be done at the Springs or at
Oakland will be decided to-day. Man
nser Coffroth has urged upon Jeffries
the desirability of being near this
city, where communication would not
be so difficult as it is when he is at
Harbin Springs.
There was a feeling of relief yes
terday among the men Interested In
the destinies of the big fight between
Jeffries and Munroe, especially as the
date seems far enough aiiead to allow
of both men being In good condition.
The wisdom of putting it off until
the last day possible under the permit
held by the Yosemlte Club was seen
yesterday when unfavorable reports
Â« ame out of Harbin Springs regard
ing Jeffries* condition. The cham
pion remained in bed all day and a
change in treatment was tried. Fresh
bandages were applied every half
liour.
Miss Jane Seymour Klink, a gradu

NEW YORK. June 14. â A telegram
received from Billy Delaney, who is
at Harbin Springs, says "Jeffries' con
dition is serious. The doctor, after
examining him to-day, was much per
turbed. I think it will be necessary
ior us to go to Oakland to finish

e-ssary to operate on Jeff's left knee."
Billy Delaney Is Disturbed.
CHICAGO. June 14.â Assistant Chief
of Police Schuettler has announced
that he will have 100 policemen at
Washington Park Saturday- to make
eure of being able to carry out Mayor
Harrison's order to prevent bookmak
ing at the race meet. Detectives, It is
declared, will locate each bookmaker
and provide for him a guard of three
patrolmen. Others will be scattered
throughout the crowd with orders to
arrest any persons caught attempting
to make a bet, even by a wink or
a nod.
If there is to be no bookmaklng at
Washington Park on Derby day there
will be none In any part of the city.
It was discovered to-day that the wire
cables connecting the hand bookmak
ers and their clearing house had all
been cut by some unknown person,
rendering the extensive wire service
useless. This has effectually stopped
taking racing news outside of the track
and disseminating it to the various
clearing houses down town.
rt was reported to-day that an un
known syndicate of bookmakers had
secured an option on an old race track
near Libertyvllle, In Lake County, and
was engaged in putting it in shape so
that if the Washington Park track is
closed the new track will have first
call on the dates formerly awarded to
the Washington Park Club.

OPINION AGAINST VOTING
IN PERSON AND BY PROXY
Movements of Steamers.
The meeting of the Board of Harbor
Commissioners yesterday was mainly
devoted to an enforcement of tha
Woodward law, providing against
trusts or combinations among dealers
in 'produce who do business upon the
waterfront belonging to the State. L.
Scatena A Co., Wolf & Sons and the
American Produce Company were
found guilty upon evidence heretofore
introduced before the board. President
Charles H. Spear and Commissioners
Kirkpatrick and Mackenzie voted
unanimously to revoke the permits of
the three firms. During the discussion
they showed an unswerving resolution
to force the produce dealers to observe
the strict letter of the Woodward act.
President Spear said there was no
spirit of vlndictlveness among the
members of the commission, but that
each of them felt that the firms in>
question had plainly violated the law
and should suffer for it.
The small dealers were ably repre
sented by Attorney Otto I. Wise and
Attorney J. B. Reinstein had charge of
the cause of the debarred firms. Doth
made lengthy arguments and Reinstein
presented an agreement signed by ,'a
number of large produce dealers as*
proof that no discrimination was beins
made against outside dealers. Attorn/y
Wise said this agreement was good
ground for his objection to the re-issu
ing of permits to the firms in question.
The agreement was positive evidence,
he said, of a combination among tha
large produce dealers on the water
front and the board should submit the
agreement to its counsel for his opinion
on the matter. Wise consented to a
stay of revocation of permits until Fri
day morning upon payment by the
three firms of $50 and the films of a
new application. All three firms paid
the $50 and filed applications for new
permits. ih,* Â¦; ' '
President Spear was empowered by a
resolution Introduced by Commissioner
Mackenzie to visit the Atlantic ports
and investigate the construction of
Â¦wharves and other matters that may
be valuable to the commission. He will
leave for the East to-day.
ACCUSED OF COMMITTING
DAYLIGHT BURGLARIES
vereichieva, fishermen, quarreled while
they were at sea in their respective
boats, and an ocean tragedy was avert
ed only by the winds that baffled their
mutual effort to lock gunwales and
fight It to a finish right there. When
they returned to Fishermen's Wharf,
however, they had full and free op
portunity to carve each other; but a
large concourse of expectant compa
triots was treated to nothing more
sanguinary than the utterance of
threats by Antonio and his arrest on
complaint of VlncenzÂ». Judge Mogan
has given himself until June 25 to pre
pare a decision in the case.
J.S. Herrln, a teamster for the Sig
nal Transfer Company, was Intoxicated
when he drove his horses at breakneck
speed over the crossings on Market
street, between Powell and Kearny,
nor was he sober when his case was
called in Judge Mogan's court. After
his name had been bawled half a dozen
times he rose from a back bench and
approached the bar with such unsteady
gait that the case was remanded till
to-day, as it is not in accord with the
intent or purpose of the law to ar
raign a person who is Inebriated.
Sam Gilmore peladed that he was
not driving at unusual speed when his
steed collided with a car on Market
street, but the animal was "green" and
rather revolutionary. He was sharply
reprimanded for attempting to break
a "green" horse on a public thorough
fare and then he was discharged.
In the case of Peter Hansen it was
the carman who posed as defendant
and the teamster, A. J. Gavlord, as
complainant. Gaylord was steering an
army wagon across the railway track
in the Presidio reservation wnen the
car, of which Hansen was the grip
man, ran into the vehicle, smashing it
and damaging Gaylord to an extent
tha^ necessitated his removal to the
post hospital. Lieutenant W. G. Reed,
officer of the day, had Hansen arrest
ed and placed in the guardhouse, where
he remained until the civil law, per
sonified by Policeman J. J. Berry, took
him in charge and booked him for bat
tery. The case was continued until
July 12, bv which' time Gaylord's In
juries will probably be sufficiently
cured to permit his appearance to tes
tify in Judge Mogan's court.
Edward J. Murphy, who has been
annoying the clergymen of St. Patrick's
Church on Mission street by soliciting
alms when he is intoxicated, was sen
tenced by Judge Fritz to sixty days'
imprisonment.
A silver bass that weighed less than
three pounds engaged the attention of
Judge Mogan and twelve big jurors
for about an hour of the morning ses
sion. The fish was not offered in evi
dence â a sanitary precaution, because
it was defunct when seized several
weeks. ago â but witnesses described ita
appearance a3 It was offered for sale
by Manuel Moggio at 519 Merchant
street and all of them agreed that it
did not look to be up to the weight
prescribed by ordinance. The jury,
however, opined that Mr. Maggio was
not the original lawbreaker as to that
particular bass, since he had purchased
it from a fisherman who guaranteed
that it met all the legal requirements.
The verdict was not guilty. .
Â« .
On motion of Attorney Johnson, for
the defense, the jury impaneled in the
case of E. B. Sproat, charged with de
frauding creditors, was discharged by
Judge Fritz and a venire issued for
seventy-five new talesmen. The case
will be again taken up next Mon
day.
John Burke is accused of stealing a
pair, of shoes from a Hayes-street foot
wear store and Judge Mogan has con
tinued the case till to-morrow to give
the police time to capture a man who
was with Burke when the alleged lar
ceny was committed. The complainant
said that the two men . entered the
store together, one of them equipped
with a valise, and that while the sales
woman's attention was engaged by one
visitor the other stole the shoes and
dropped them into the bag. Burke re
cently came here from Seattle and
seems about to =uccumb to tubercu
losis.
Fred Moller, Alias .Michaels, an Ex-
Convict, Arrested and Booked
on Three Charses.
Three charges of burglary were
booked at the City Prison yesterday
against Fred Moller, alias Michaels, an
ex-convict, and the police have not
yet finished with their investigation
as to the number of his offenses. * H-s
is a daylight burglar. His mode of
operation is to ring the doorbell of a
house. If no one responds he effects
an entrance.
He was arrested on Sunday by Po
licemen Quarles and Jackson. De
tectives Harper and Armstrong hav*
since learned that he entered the resi
dence of Mrs. Reynolds, 1213 Lagun;*
street, on June 3: that of D. Bernstein.
176 # 8 Sutter street, on June 5. ami
Miss Mary Golden's. at 2355 Pine
street, on June 7. From *>ach he stole
a quantity of silverware. Walter F.
Warden, 395 Haight street, also iden
tified him as a man "he discovered
crawling through a window of his res
idence on Sunday afternoon. May 29.
Moller, on December 28, 1901. was
sentenced to serve two years in San
Quentin for burglary for entering thÂ«
store of II. Hoshimo, 881 Eddy street,
and on December 4. 1903, he was sen
tenced to six months in the County
Jail for stealing a watch.
Giinther*s Case Argued.
Superior Judge Sloss yesterday took
under consideration the application of
Edward W. Gunther against the Po
lice Court for a writ of review and
certiorari of the action by which he
was arrested upon a charge of jury
bribing. The warrant was issued by
Police Judge Fritz at the instance of
David J. Kelley, a member of the jury
trying Nguen Lun and other China
men for murder. Kelley alleged that
Gunther offered him a bribe of $150.
Gunther claims that the warrant for
his arrest was unconstitutional. Ar
guments were made by William Hoff
Cook for the plaintiff and by Assistant
City Attorney Isaac Harris for the
Police Judges.
Damages for Malpracth-e.
Seraflna Barsiand her children, who
sued Dr. Camillio Bursottl for $10,000
for altered malpractice, were yester
day awarded judgment for $250 by a
jury in Superior Judge Kerrigan's
court. Mrs. Barsi alleged that her
husband, Americo Barsi, was injured,
sustaining a compound fracture of the
leg and internal hurts, and thai be
cause of the unskillful treatment of
Dr. Barsotti Barsi did not recover.
The suit was hotly contested.
We have to report that Frank H. Irvine,
sÂ»n olU-r err.i ioyed on the Oceanic Steamship
Company's steamer Vrntura, while on h-r
last voyage from Sydney to Ban Francisco,
during the 4 to S watch, about 3 o'clock p- nu
on the evenlns of May 2<j\ 1VHH. while in lat
itude 2 degrees .".6 minute* pouth. and lcngi
tude 163 d^Kreea 2Â» minutts â¢ west, and
between Pago Pago and Fanning - Island?.
fell Into the crank pit while the en :
gines were running full Â»DftJ and met his
death. The engines at the time were in
charge of Robert Hill, second assistant
engineer who heard a thud, but no outcry.
He immediately s'.orped the engines to ascer
tain the cause. He, found Mr. Irvine with
hi* Â£kull fractured and Bretumably dead in
the bottom of the crank pit. The shlo's sur
g*-cn was Immediately called and pronounced
him dc-afi. whereupon the body waÂ» properly
jr^pared fcr burial at sea.
OwlnK to the steamier having facilities to
bring the body to port in gixxi condition ar.<1
the protestations of the engineer* against a
st-a burial, the body was brought to San Fran
cisco. After the Inauest was held th* body
was Interred at Oakland. Cal.
On June 4 we made a personal ex
amination of the engines on the Ventura and
found that all the necessary hand-rails were
In position, anU, together with the sworn
fctattrotnts cf T. W. Lawrence, the chief
tr.jinetr, and Robert Hill, the second as
sistant engineer, that the^e safety rails were
in the same condition at the time Mr. Irvine
lost his life, there can be no doubt that he
accidentally met his death while attending
to his duties as oil^r en said steamer; and
we therefore exonerate the licensed officers of
said fteamer and ail other* conn<tted here
with. â¢
United States Inspectors John K.
Bulger and O. F. Bolles made the fol
lowing report yesterday to Supervising
Inspector John Bermingham:
Ventura Accident Investigated.
Three commission firms doing busi
ness on the water front were deprived
of their permits yesterday by the
Board of Harbor Commissioners. They
are L. Scatena & Co., Wolf & Sons and
the American Produce Company. Sub
sequently they obtained a stay until
Friday morning upon the payment oC
a $50 fine and the filing of an appli
cation for a new permit. At 11 o'clock
Friday morning the Harbor Comniis
sioners will pass upon the applications
and determine whether or not the
firms will be allowed to continue buy
ing and selling produce upon the
property of the State.
Arthur S. Luce said that Sonoma
County will send fruit to this city for
the visitors from the East and .will
also forward fruit to St. Louis. Man
ager Briggs was requested to provide
for the collection of fruit for St. Louis
and for the visitors to this city. When
the. Knights Templar are here there
will be a special entertainment for
them on the part of the State Board
of Trade and the Odd 'Fellows will
also be entertained.
Commissioner Filcher reported that
recommendation on the part of the
California Board of Trade would have
weight to secure the appointment of
representative Calif ornians upon the
juries that will make awards in the
several classes of exhibits at the St.
Louis Exposition. He believed that
President N. P. Chipman of the board
would be the best man in the State to
pass upon horticultural exhibits. He
complimented the forestry exhibit at
St. Louis, which was prepared under
the direction of Mr. Mills. The entire
cost' to the State for making that ex
hibit was but $1200.
S. F. Booth reported that the
Knights Templar Conclave will bring
from 15,000 to 30,000 visitors to San
Francisco in September, and that the
visiting Odd Fellows, who will come
directly after, will number about the
same. He suggested that fruit should
be distributed to the visitors at that
time.
On motion of John P. Irish the
board voted to do what it could to
promote the erection of a tourist hotel
in Oakland. It was voted to leave
to the manager of the board the pub
lication in pamphlet form of the
article that recently appeared in The
Call under the signature of W. H.
Mills concerning the hydrography of
the Sacramento River.
A epecial subject had been set for
discussion by the board, this beins the
re-ceding the Yosemite by the State of
California to the national Government.
Past President McNoble-of the Native
Sons of the Golden West was to have
been present to present the merits of
the case to the board, but he was ill
and the matter accordingly went over
until the next monthly meeting. Di
rector John P. Irish made some forci
ble remarks about the manner in which
the Tosemite and the national reserva
tion surrounding the Yosemite have
been treated at times by the State and
Federal officers. Probably it would ba
better if the Interior Department had
nothing to do with the Yosemite, he
said. The management by the State and
national authorities that have had cus
tody of the Yosemite and the surround
ing reservation had been either in
famous or Idiotic.
W. H. Mills called attention to the
State's new park in the Big Basin. It
was due to his presentation of facts
that it was voted to have an excursion
to that place. Mr. Mills said that the
facilities for accommodating guests
over night ,and for feeding them are
not extensive, but he felt certain that
the people of Santa Cruz, who desire
to have Santa Cruz the point of de
parture for the Big Basin, would pro
vide tents and other necessaries. The
State commission would co-operate
that the Big Basin might be seen by
the excursionists. '% ;
OAKLAND'S NEW HOTEL.
The question of sending on fresh fruit
to the California Commissioners to be
used as exhibits was discussed. Arthur
Luce and Mr. McDonald of Sonoma
County reported that steps had been
already taken in Sonoma County by
the Sonoma County Board of Trade to
have Sonoma fruits sent on. Manager
Briggs paid Mr. Dennison, who is
wanted at St. Louis, the compliment of
saying that his services might be neces
sary in California to provide that fresh
California fruits for shipment to the
California Commissioners shall be
properly packed and prepared for dis
play. Mr. Dennison is an acknowledg
ed expert in the handling of fruit. It
was finally left to the discretion of
Manager Briggs to determine whether
it would be better for the interests of
the State to send Mr. Dennison to St.
Louis or to keep him at work in Cali
fornia in connection with exhibits to be
forwarded to St. Louis.
The California State Board of Trade
decided yesterday to .have two excur
sions, one to St. Louis in October to
carry a California party to the exposi
tion; the other excursion to be to the
BIr Basin in Santa Cruz County, the
latter party to be limited to 100 persons.
J. A. Filcher appeared before the board
and made a long and interesting state
ment relating to the condition of the
California exhibits in the various de
partments of the St. Louis show, and
also 'made a suggestion concerning the
ways in which the board can assist the
California Commission to St. Louis.
Commissioner Filcher said that an
exhibit without sufficient attendants to
explain all about it to those who in
quire loses much of its value. He de
sired that the board should provide for
sending George Dennison, the assist
ant secretary of the board, to St. Louis
at once, to remain there something
like two months. He also wished that
President N. P. Chipman, Manager A.
R. Briggs and others of the board
should visit St. Louis later, each spend
ing considerable time at the show and
working there for the good of the Stats
In conjunction with the Commissioners.
In his opinion the board could, through
its representatives,, do much at St.
Louis, probably even more than in San
Francisco at this time.
FRESH FRUIT EXHIBITS.
I beUeve that Snow's influence over the un
fortunate fellow is hypnotic At time? when I
have eeen them together Goldman would al
raoat sÂ«a to obey unexpressed wishes of
fneÂ». He has made & bankrupt of himself
. .*â¢ of thia ft i arc* spell, and all to Snow's
; :â¢. 2.r.tajrp. My client even paid the ex-ilayor a
laundry bills.
I think that there is no doubt of Goldman's
ir.far'.ty. That, cf course, will be the plea.
Goldman was almost a nervous wreck
when seen last night. He 6eemed un
able to collect his faculties and his face
was ghastly. The shifty eyes that can
meet no steady gaze wandered help
lessly about the prison as he mumbled.
â¢ I don't know why I did it. He was
my best friend."
Goldman's case was postponed until
Paturday. when some definite opinions
on Snow's condition are expected. The
charge against Goldman is assault to
murder.
X adrrit that my client is an unpleasant
p-yehoicgical rrr>ble;n. but there is something
to I- said on his *,â¢â¢>. Snow had a ctrange
Influence over bim and used It to his financial
Â¦ilraauxa. I know and can iirove that (or
\ Â«Â¦*!Â¦* Snow has systematically bled my client.
I myse.f witnessed some transactions between
them wh*r*by Snow enriched himself to the
extent cf several thousand*.
Goldman, the half-witted assailant of
the former Mayor, spent a sleepless
night at the City Prison Tuesday. He
moaned continually and paced his cell
like a frightened animal. Yesterday
morning he appeared before Judge
Mogan to be instructed as to
bis rights. In the court room he
vas nervous !>ut not violent. He re
tained sufficient composure to mumble
answers, but his fishy eyes avoided
every glance. When removed to his
cell he collapsed entirely.
Attorney Frank Murphy, who ap
peared for the prisoner, was exceed
ingly titter against Snow. He said:
The condition of ex-Mayor R. W.
Bnow, who was shot down by Adolph
Goldman on Tuesday evening, was
Flig-htly better yesterday and Dr. Frank
Knorp expressed some hope of re
covery. An attempt to locate the bul
lets was unsuccessful, but Snow wa3
cheerful and teemed to grow stronger
toward evening. The physicians at the
Waldeck Sanatorium, where the wound
Â«d man Is lying, agree that his life will
totter in the balance for a week. His
daughter. Miss Gertrude Snow, remains
near him.
Assailant's Lawyer Thinks
That Snow Held Client
Under a Hypnotic Spell
Says Suggestions Should Be
Made for Jurors to Act
at St. Louis World's Fair
Short Respite Is Granted
Upon Payment of Fines
With New Applications
Antonio Balestro and Vlncenzo El-
Mark Schleiber and Lena Hecht lived
and loved in the. East ere they 'lived
and quarreled in San Francisco. Lena
told Judge Mogan that it was Mark
who started the dissension that cul
minated in her leaving him. Then he
pursued her all over the city, ' she
added, until he brought her to bay in
a saloon at 109 Powell street, where he
was threatening to decapitate her with
a large knife when Detectives Mul
cahey and Taylor rescued her and ar
rested him. Mark pleaded that his sole
object in pursuing and threatening
Lena was to recover clothing belong
ing to him which she had taken away
with her from his apartment. The case
was continued till to-day.
When the Latin quarter hears that
Mary Cuneo, chronic disturber of the
peace and defendant in Police Court,
Is in her cups and on the warpath,
there is a general scurrying for cover
behind barred doors. The bravest spirit
in all that brave district prefers com
pulsory seclusion to encountering
Mary's tongue and fists. So it came to
pass that when shte started out to
find a fight last Monday afternoon her
quest was vain. Little Italy fled at
her approach as chaff scatters before
the wind. It was in sheer desperation,
therefore, that she decided to seek a
"scrap" where a "scrapper" was cer
tain to be found. She went to the sa
loon owned and presided over by Toby
Irwin, the well-known lightweight
pugilist, and smashed a window by
way of a challenge. But ill fortune
attended the experiment. Irwin prob
ably had "heard of her fistic prowess,
or it may have been that he considered
it Indiscreet to go out of his class and
give away so muclA weight (she tips
the beam at 183 pounds) ; but, whatever
his reason, he side-stepped the defl and
had the Amazon arrested. Judge Fritz
will sentence her to-day for malicious
mischief.
Judge Cabaniss dismissed the charge
of assault with intent to do bodily
injury which Edmund E. Coblentz, a
newspaper reporter, had entered
against former Police Sergeant Reuben
E. Wolf, and then the defendant was
Immediately rearrested on a charge of
battery sworn- to by the same com
plainant before Judge Fritz. Wolf's
bail was fixed at $1000, and he fur
nished it.
The original charge was dismissed
because the testimony was insufficient
to prove it. but there is ample evi
dence to support the accusation of
battery. Wolf will be arraigned be
fore Judge Fritz this morning.
Policeman Hemenez testified that on
Monday afternoon he was summoned
by telephone to hasten to the
rear of the saloon at 547 How
ard street, where he would see
something worth witnessing and cer
tainly entitled to his official attention.
He hastened as requested, and at the
place designated found Mrs. Cecilia
Hughes of 44 Harriet street and. Mrs.
Kitty Moore of 611% Jessie street danc
ing for the entertainment of a small
but select group of spectators. Includ
ing some children. The dance was- en
hanced in effectiveness by the scant
costume of the dancers. When ar
rested Mrs. Hughes resolutely de
clined to don any more cloth
ing, but Mrs. Moore, who was less
intoxicated and more amenable to rea
son, did consent to put on her skirt
and shoes. In that condition they were
conveyed to prison in a patrol wagon.
When the women were arraigned be
fore Judge Mogan they had not en
tirely recovered from the effects â¢' of
their imbibing,' and with arms inter
locked they swayed unsteadily before
the bar and pleaded not guilty. His
Honor promptly ordered their removal.
They will be sentenced to-day.
The rare spectacle of a jury of two
hearing testimony and returning a
verdict was seen yesterday in Police
Judge Cabaniss' court. William Dan
iels and Fred Hahn, apprentice har
nessmakers, were the defendants,
whom Joseph Rico of 38 Rausch
street accused of peace disturbance
and battery. He testified that he ac
cepted employment in a Front-street
harness factory from which they had
retired because their demand for higher
wages had been refused, and that on
June 8 they assaulted him after he had
declined to resign his position. They
pulled him off a street car and called
him insulting names, he said. The de
fense was a denial of the charges, and
the verdict was acquittal after the two
good men and true had been locked up
for seven minutes.
It was the contention of the rival
attorneys that resulted in reducing the
panel to two members. The legal rep
resentative of the Citizens' Alliance
conducted the prosecution, and Walter
Gallagher was retained by the Har
nessmakers' Union, so the case, al
though trivial in itself, possessed all
the interest that attaches to any con
flict between the advocates and op
ponents of the "open shop." There
was a venire of . fifty to draw from,
but none of the men swprn seemed
eager to serve, and finally the situation
reached a point when It meant either
proceeding to trial with a jury of two
or trying a new venire. So the attor
neys agreed to go ahead with the duo
in the box, consisting of F. Beckstein
of 1561 Market street and S. G. Mosti
of 54 Seventh street.
Neither of the jurors seemed to
relish the responsibility that was so
puddenly thrust upon them, and one
of them so Informed the Judge.
"My dear sir," said His Honor, "you
have only to imagine that you have
eleven companions instead of one, and
to base your finding upon the evidence.
Then the rest will be easy. How would
you like to .sit -here day after day,
as I do, and assume entire responsi
bility of deciding the guilt or inno
cence of a defendant, instead, of shar
ing it with another, as you do in this
case?"
The juror replied that one-half of
the responsibility was as much as he
cared to shoulder.
The Ho-lliswood left Newcastle, Aus
tralia, 109 days ago with a cargo of
coal for this port. When a voyage
lasts beyond a certain period coal be
comes more or less of a dangerous
cargo and the longer It Is confined in
the ho-ld of a ehip the more liable is
it to spontaneous combustion.
The Holliswood was spoken off this
port May 25 by the bark Prussia. The
position of the speaking was not re
ported, but the Prussia was at the
time seven ' days out from this poTt
and has arrived since at Grays Har
bor. The Holliswood was short of pro
visions and was supplied by the Prus
sia with what was thought to be suffl
cient'to last her to port.
; Captain Tuttle, commander of the
Daniel Manning, is engaged in the in
vestigation of the collision between the
steamer Bear and the schooner Spo
kane. If the Hoiriswood does not ap
pear at the conclusion of the investi
gation the Manning will go forth and
search the seas for the overdue bark. â¢
The American bark Holliswood * Is
causing those Interested in her some
anxiety and If 8he does not arrive
within the next few days the United
States revenue cutter Daniel Manning,
Captain Tuttle. will leave here In
search of her.

Read carefully. An honeet proposition.
(You to be full Judge.)
I do hereby solemnly agree and guarantee to
make no charge If I fall to tell your name, oc-
cupation and what you called for: I tell you If
hut-band, wife or lover Is true or false; who and
when you will marry; how to gain the love of
the one you desire; '-In fact," I will tell you
every hope, fear or ambition better than you
can tell yourself; his advice Is reliable; his
powers are wonderful and Indisputable; he Im-
proves your character so that you will reach
the highest ' possible development In mental
visor, health, happiness and capacity to earn
wealth: the controlling power Implanted In your
nature, so you can control any one secretly;
cures disease and lost vitality; gives advice on

FROM ALL SECTIONS THEY COME TO
WITNESS THE WONDERFUL DEMON-
STRATIONS of the NOTED LIVINGSTONE.
For a reliable and Intelligent clairvoyant
reading go to LIVINGSTONE. 42S Eddy st.
He asks you no questions, but tells you
what you wish to know.
He does not mention all the Ills and mis-
fortunes you are heir to. You are acquainted
with the facts In your case. Let PROFESSOR
LIVINGSTONE analyze the matters that are
troubling you, find the cause of trouble and
suggest the remedy. -ii
He Is as conspicuous for his wonderful oc-
cult analysis as he it for his original ex-
pression and vivid truthfulness.
Would Jt not be a relief to know how 70U
will succeed, to be relieved of the matters that
are troubling you and of the schemes of your
enemies, that you may meet with better success?
A test reading Is not a life reading. When
you call on PROF. LIVINGSTONE he will
give you a full life reading for $1. A test
Is of little value; when the mind is troubled
you need more substantial aid and advice.

STOCK MAKKET.
Entertaining pictures of Japan and
the Japanese, as they were seen by
English sea captains nearly three hun
dred years ago are to be found in the
log kept by Captain Saris of the first
voyage to Japan to open up trade there
for the East India Company. Thanks
to the widespreading of England's
fame as victor over Spain, Saris was
received very honorably by "the old
King Foyu." The people, too, were, as
a rule, both civil and courteous to him.
although rude boys, who exist -every
1 where and at all time's, occasionally
followed the English sailors through
the streets, throwing stones and shout
ing "Core, Core, Core "Ware," which
Saris translated into "You Coreans
with false hearts."
As to their naval enterprise. Saris
says: "About eight or tenne leagues
on this side the straights of Xemina-
Seque we found a large Towne where
there lay in a Docke a Juncke of eight
hundred or a thousand tunnes of bur
then, sheathed all of yron, with a guard
appointed to keep her from firing and
treachery. Shfe was built in a very
homely fashion, much like that which
describeth Noah's Ark unto us. The
Naturals told us that she served to
transport souldiers in any of the
Hands, if rebellion or warre should
happen."
Saris coasted round to Fushlmi,
where he saw the garrison three thou
sand strong "shifted," a change that
took place every three years. "We
saw," he says, "the old Bands march
1 away, and the new enter in most Soul
dtr-like manner, marching five abreast,
and to evry ten files an Officer which is
called of Captaine of fiftle. who kept
them continually in very good order.
Â¦ * â¢ Such good order was taken for
the passing and providing: for. of these
three thousand Soldiers that no man
either travelling or inhabiting upon the
way where thev lodged was any way
Injured by them, but cheerfully enter
tayned them as his guests, because
they paid for what they tooke, as all
other men did. Every Towne and Vil
lage upon the way being well fitted
with Cookes and Victualling Houses,
where they might at an Instant have
what they needed; and dyet them
selves from a pennie English a meale
to two shillings a meale."â London
Dally Chronicle.

Visit.
Peculiar Conditions Xoted by Enslisn
The country which figures to the
smallest extent in this list is Bulgaria,
with an ocean cable about three
fourths of a mile long. Roumanla beats
her neighbor with a cable four and
one-third miles Ion*.â New York Sun.
As already mentioned. Denmark is
fourth on the list with 9488 miles. Ger
manys lags behind with 9228 miles of
cable, of which more than one-third is
owned by the Government. Its most
important cable service Is that between
the Island of Borkum, Fayal and New
York City.
The seventeen other countries which
take a financial interest in cables have
altogether only 11.131 miles of lines,
nearly all of them owned by the va
rious Governments.
Our country In second on the list with
44.470 miles of cable, nearly all in pri
vate hands, the Government control
ling only a short mileage in Alaskan
waters. The most important are the
five lines across the Atlantic and the
second great Pacific cable, completed
on July 25. 1903. by the Commercial Pa
cific Cable Company, between San
Francisco, Honolulu, Midway Island,
Guam and ..the Philippines. Another,
great line laid down by American cap
italists is that on the Pacific Coast
between the Isthmus of Tehuantepec
and Valparaiso, Chile.
France has the i third place with a
total length of 24,010 miles, of which
10,092 are the property of the state.
The most Important of the submarine
connections of France are the two lines
which connect Brest with the United
States.
The reason is that. the Great North
ern Telegraph Company, with its of
fices at Copenhagen, laid and operates
one of the most important systems in
the Orientâ that which connects Vlad
ivostok with Nagasaki, Shanghai and
Hongkong.
There are ; in operation to-day 252,
436 miles of ocean cables, of which only
38,797 miles, or about 15 per cent, are
owned by Governments, the remainder
being in the hands of private owners.
Englishmen opened the first cable
line â across the narrow channel be
tween Dover and Calais, on August 28,
1850â and the Englishmen still control
a larger mileage than the capitalists
of any other country, and more than
half the total of the submarine lines.
The British cables which connect
London with all parts of the world
have a length of 154,099 miles, of which
14.963 are. owned by the Government.
Of the 189,136 miles owned by private
companies, the largest mileage is In
the Australian and Oriental lines. The
Eastern Extension, Australia and
China Telegraph Company controls 27,
609 miles and the "Western Telegraph
Company 19,880 miles.
The most important of the British
cable lines are the five that stretch
across the North Atlantic, and also the
first line stretched across the Pacific
which connects Vancouver with the
Fiji Islands, Norfolk Island. Queens
land and New Zealand, and which was
opened on December 9, 1903. Among
the many British lines also are cables
to South America and along both of its
coasts.
Denmark has a more prominent place
among countries whose capitalists have
engaged in laying -ocean cables than
might be' expected from her inferior
commercial importance. She ranks
fourth on the list, even surpassing Ger
many. '

NEW YORK. June 14.â The stock market
relapsed to-day Into an aggravated condition
of apathy and indifference and. was without
feature except for. a rally at the close. Yes
terday's reaction effectually blighted the hopes
of a revival of speculation - which had "been
gradually aroused by last week's slow upward
movement of prices. It became quite as
manifest to-day however, that the traders
were t6 reap Uttle advantsge from a price
movement In the other direction, as the selling
bad spent Its force. The consequence was an
Insignificant drift of prices, with no defined
current in any direct! >n. Each abortive move
ment of price* confirms the conviction that a
lengthened period of speculative conservatism
is to be faced, and adds to the indisposition
to undertake operations of any magnitude In
tbe market. - Attention is directed to the an
nouncements of withdrawals from business of
Stock Exchange houses and departure for Ions
heavily this year, but to let the coast carry
the Dried Fruit, which can be bought by thÂ«
Easterners as wanted.

demand continues fair, with growers rather
Indisposed to sell. Quotations remain about
the same, however. The other descriptions of

for shipment to Puget Sound ports. The best
stock was keenly competed for and one lot of
20 boxes brought $2 30 per cental. Old Pota
toes shared In the general firmness and prices
stood about as previously quoted. Onions were
plentiful and lower.
Another car of Mississippi Tomatoes came In
and was offered at easier rates. The Los An
geles and Mexican products were in excessive
supply and dealers were rutting prices In
order to forcÂ«* sales. Green Corn arrived freely
and sold by the sack at easier rates. Aspara

the current week, and moved off rather slowly.
a* the car 'was made up almost entirely of

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
Receipts of Butter and Eggs were very
heavy yesterday and made up for the falling
off of Monday. Those of Butter were enor
mous, as will be seen â they were the talk of
the street and kept the teams busy all the
morning getting the goods up from the landing
places to the stores. Most of the arrivals
were in goo>l shape, the sudden change to cool
weather rehardenlng goods that otherwise
would have come In soft. The market was
generally quoted quiet, as usual at this time
of the year, and the feeling was rather weak
than otherwise, with a disposition to sell.
There is no real change in Cheese, though
some houses find a rather steadier feeling in
fine mild new. The cheap grades continue as
plentiful and weak as ever.
There is no change whatever in Eggs, the
market being liberally supplied and quiet,
with the retailers looking for stock that they
can retail at 25c, as already mentioned.

All kinds of Citrus and Deciduous fruits
wfpÂ»,in free Â«upply and trade In the latter was
attractive, both locally and for shipping ac
count. Choice lots of small tree fruits, such
as Pear*. Plums and Apricots, were wanted
fcr shipping and met with prompt sale at or
near the top- rates. ' Good, sound Cherries,
packed in flat drawers and In 'Cartons, were
scarce and in demand, and occasional lots
commanded . a premium. Receipts of loose
Cherries werw less liberal than on the preced
ing day and Bla?k and common White cleaned
up quickly at firmer rates. The canners were
buying common White at the quotations and
paid l%'S5c per pound for. Royal .Anne. Figs
arrived freely from several sections and in all

Portervllle was held at 20#25c per pound.
Large Strawberries were in good request and
firmer, while Longworths were lower, owing to
the poor condition of the berries. The other
berries were in Increased supply and easier,
except for fancy Blackberries. A portion of
the receipts of Raspberries arrived late in the
day and had to be sold at low prices, hence
the wide range in the quotations.

CHICAGO,- JunÂ« : 14. â Sentiment in the wheat
pit was bearish from the start. Initial prices
for July being down J /4Â®%c to He at 86VÂ»c to
8QV'Â»c. A number of influences combined to
create a 'feeling of depression, the most impor
tant'being the imperfect harvest weather in
the South. Weakness of. foreign markets in
the .face of a eharp upturn here yesterday
was another bearish element. The fact also
thht the flrat carload of new wheat had ar
rived at St. ; Louis mnd had graded No. 2 red
brought out a number of selling orders.. .Many
trader* went short in the expectation that
the weekly Weather Bureau report would show
an Improvement In' the condition of the -crop.
The rrarkct continued . heavy throughout the
day, about the only demand coming from shorts.
A comparatively small decrease In the world's
visible supply was 4 late bear factor and
intensified the desire to sell. Prices were fur
ther weakened" by private advices from Paris,
estimating 12Va.P?r ce,nt increase in the French
crop over last year. After selling down to
81HiÂ£H4%q. July closed at si-VÂ«M%c.
Favorable weather had a bearish effect on
corn, aÂ« well as on wheat, but another factor,
of possibly equal importance was the largo
increase In private and public stocks.- The
market had a downward tendency throughout
the entire session and final figures were al
most at thp lowest poln: of the day. July
opened a shade to "ic lower at Â»'.<!{/Â« lit".;, sold
down to 48HÂ®48V;c, and closed at 4s%@18Hc.
Corn yielded only a trifle, despite the weak

Warm. c;eai weather and northerly winds
oootlaaH during tbe week in nearly all ra rts

the moral and nortln-rn section*.
The (tr>itn crop has been further damaged by

I .:â¢;â¢. ::Â¦.> to waJnuts, checking the blight
which had appeared in some place*, and the
t,roÂ«pect Is good for an average crop. Grapes
are setting well, and the ralFln crop in San

Teaches in the vicinity of Anaheim will be a
failure. Oranges In San Bernardino County
are in excellent condition.

trips of former great operators, much looked
to for leadership of great speculative move
ments. Curiosity Its manifested to see how
far the coming turn of the half-year and of
the full fiscal year for many accountings may
be fixed for winding up of business affairs
and of partnership dissolutions. The weekly
bulletin on the crops, issued by the Weather
Bureau at Washington at noon, was-abund
antly encouraging on the progress of wheat and
cotton, and the slight tone of conservatism
on the corn crop was not alarming. Reaction
followed, with some special pressure against
the coalers. This was due to specific reports
that proceedings against the coal combination
had been determined upon as a result t>t i the
Investigation conducted by the Interstate Com- ;
merce Commission. Reading was carried Â¦
slightly below last night on the reaction. The '
market rallied quite vigorously late in the day, :
led again by Manhattan, which rose 3%., A i
number of the active railroad stocks also
moved up a point or more, and the market
closed strong. The rally was helped by rumors
which circulated in the board room that a set
tlement had been arrived at out of court of j
the Northern Securities dispute
The inquiry for bonds was broad and re- I
suited In moving many long dormant issue*,
but sales were effected In come cases at con
cessions. Large blccks of some of the stand- |
ard investment bonds changed hands. Total
sales, par value, $2,295,000.

R. C. Porter, an 18-year-old boy, re
siding with his parents at San .An
selmo, was taken onto custody yester
day afternoon by United States Mar
shal Shine on a complaint charging
him with violation of the postal laws.
The complainant "is Theodore Lowe,
manager of the Raven, a periodical
published in this city. He alleges that
Porter addressed him an insulting let
ter with the following on the envelope:
"Lowe. 316 Clay street, city. The
thief editor of the Raven fake." f_.;V :>
Porter, who appears to be an un
sophisticated youth, shed tears when
informed that he would be taken to
jail in default of $500 bonds. He said
his father would not be over from San
Anselmo , until 6 p. m. and United
States Commissioner Manley and Mar
shal Shine consented to wait until that
hour. Porter stated that he had
worked for Lowe for six weeks as
stenographer and typewriter and that
Lowe had refused to pay him his
salary, which was at the rate of $35
per month. He -had been dunning
Lowe for some weeks, he said, but had
failed to extract either silver or gold
from the representative of the black
bird. '

whom Justices Shaw, McFarland,

Lorlgan dissent in each case.
Many towns did not avail themselves
of the privilege,' but they were still
subject to the general laws until 1S96.
In that year there was passed a con
stitutional amendment which provided
that all cities and towns shouia be
controlled by the general laws' ex
cept in "municipal affairs'."
In 1901 the Legislature passed section
3366 of the Political Code, which forbids
all cities and towns from imposing li
cense taxes except for police regula
tion. The Supreme Court holds, how
ever, that this law applies only to such
cities and towns as have been incor
porated under the constitution or such
as have, reorganized under the pro
vision of the general law.
Previous to the adoption of the con
stitution cities and towns were created
by special acts of the Legislature. The*
constitution provided for the Incorpor
ation of municipalities of the various
classes and made them all subject to
the general laws. Opportunity was
offered for all cities and towns cre
ated by special acts of the Legislature
to reorganize under the general laws
relating to corporations for "municipal
purposes."
A majoritv of the Supreme Court de
cided yesterday that cities and towns'
created by special acts of the Legis
lature prior to" the adoption of the
State constitution and not since reor
ganized under the general laws are not
affected by section 3366 of the Political
Code, which prohibits local govern
ments from enacting license laws f6r
revenue. A large number of cities and
towns are affected by this ruling, and
many of them have enacted laws for
revenue.
The matter was brought to the at
tention of the Supreme Court on writs
of habeas corpus from Whittier,
Marysvllle and Santa Clara. The au
thorities of Whittier imposed a reve
nue tax on the livery and feed busi
ness, Marysville taxed restaurants and
Santa Clara taxed several kinds of
business.

SOLVES BLIND
LEGAL PUZZLE
.The Justices of the Peace visited
Mayor Schmitz yesterday to urge his
assistance in the proposition not to
hold an election for Justices of the
Peace this year, for the reason that the
State law, backed by the opinion of
City Attorney Long, makes the term
four years. Election Commissioner
Devoto was also present. After hear
ing argument why an election should
not be held Mayor Schmitz stated th^t
he would not interfere with any
course decided upon by the Election
Commission. The latter body will
meet to-morrow night and settle the
question.

ly that Ruef was afflicted with the
germ of greatness for which there was
no cure. George H. Bahrs answered
the question "Is Devotion to Politics

evening with. an original poem on "The

Suddenly and with no warning Ruef
went into a caustic roast on papers
that have criticized him. His language
ys as so severe that the wine in the
glasses boiled over. Some applauded
and others whispered to him to for
bear. But the speaker was warmed
up arid spoke his mind freely. He con
tinued until the impatient orchestra
started "Bedelia."

for the tumult to subside Ruef smiled
the smile of confidence and capered to
the tune of "He's a Jolly good fellow."

could be paid to any man," paid Ruef.
"But It is likely to bring me a load of
"May he live long to remember this
occasion," said the Mayor, "and to
ehow this tribute to his children and
his grandchildren." .'
Finally Mayor Schmitz realized that
the assemblage would d6 some damage
to the caterer's ware if the big event
was withheld much longer. He rose
holding. a red sack, from which he pro
duced a gold-plated loving cup. He
read the inscription: "To A. Ruef as a

anteroom before the banquet, and as he
showed it to those about he was as
near tears as he ever has been. For
the first time in his public life he was
without words.
James A. Devoto, the Civil Service
Commissioner, was the initial speaker.
He responded to the toast, "Our State."
He was indistinct, and, at the sugges

climbed upon a chair, better to ba heard.
He thundered away from this point of
vantage, but so great was the babbling
among the banqueters that most of his
words were lost in the shuffle. R. H.

"Innocents Abroad," was scarcely less
fortunate, although h^ occupied a

He made a rattling fct>ech, but most

Proudest of all the manifestations of
friendship was Ruef over the invita
tion extended him to attend the ban
quet. It was an engraved silver plate,
with the seal of the City and County
of San Francisco raised in gold upon it
and flanked by enameled poppies, the
Dinner completed. Mayor Schmitz
acted as toastmaster. /Vmong some
strong things he uttered was a sen
tence that appealed to the banqueters
with force. "This occasion," he said,
"is a fitting rebuke to the dastardly
lies that have been published regard
ing our honored guest; not alone
about him, but about every public of
ficial who has dared to think and act

Men climbed the table and stood
in the icecream to voice the indorse
ment given by the' Mayor. Down
through the center aisle came a waiter
carrying a magnificent horseshoe of
budding roses. It was from the
Greek- American Republican Club,
bearing the inscription, "This is
just â¢ a token- from the Greeks
American Club. forwarding you
its greetings and wishing you to re
turn conqueror from your political
mission." Numerous other floral
emblems were stacked in 'front of
Ruefs place â¢ at the banquet board
and they all bore the happiest hopes
for health and success.
ritOUD OF INVITATION.
MAYOR IS ACTIVE.
Despite some drawbacks those pres
ent had the time of their lives in
wafting greetings to v Ruef on his east
ward way. The long hall where the
banquet was spread was a bower of
ferns and smilax. Flowers of all hueq
decked the tables and the red, white
and blue of the United States covered
the lumbered walls. An orchestra of
thirty pieces, embowered in greens and
national flags, played patriotic and
popular airs. When "Columbia" was
started the entire assemblage rose to
its feet and drank its wine silently.
Ruef was becomingly late. Although
the invitation stated that the big event
was to occur at 7 o'clock, it was 8
o'clock before he reached the pavilion.
He was taken in hand at once by the
committee, and "Big Bill" Minnehan,
the police guardian of Telegraph Hill,
who was specially detailed for the oc
casion, escorted the guest of honor to
his seat at the banquet board. Flank
ing him on one side was Mayor
Schmitz and on the other was Frank A.
Maestrelti, the Fire Commissioner,
George Boyne acted as master of cere
monies anJ started the speech-making.
RUEF COMES LATE.
There was more cheering than eat
ing. Every time Ruefs name was
mentioned the entire house arose to
its legs and roared. Mayor Schmitz
was scarcely less popular, and the
mention of his name evoked a throaty
shout from the banqueters. Police
Judge Cabaniss was honored by three
cheers between the chops and the
chicken.
Ruef took the cake, all the cold pie
on the dump and eighty-nine per cent
of the value contained in the tailings.
Rooting for a favorite died a pale death
compared with the reception tendered
the guest of the evening. Mayor
Schmitz presided. Judges and me
chanics, commissioners and newsboys,
preachers and saloon men. Sheriffs and
men about town sat in the four lines
of tables that stretched through the
big hall.
Abraham Ruef was the whole thing
last night. Seven hundred of his
friends tendered him a banquet on tha
eve of his departure to the Republican
National Convention at Chicago as al
ternate for John D. Spreckels. The
banquet was given in the art gallery of
Mechanics 1 Pavilion. .
South Park, on Bryant and Brannan
streets, between Second and Third, will
shortly pass into the uncoiuested pos
session of the city of San Francisco,
upon payment of $20,000 appropriated
by the Supervisors for the purpose. The
title of the property has been for seven
years in litigation" between the city and
"the heirs of the Wallace and Little es
tates j;nd yesterday the suit was ended
in Judce Sea well's court by Judgment
in favor of the city" After some years
at law. the Supervisors authorized the
city attorneys to buy the property &>r
120.000 â of which $10,000 was to be paid
\rben the title was cleared and $10,001
with the pepsins of the deed. The suit
for possession against the city was in
the name of Daniel Wallace and the
executors of the estates of Richard
Wallaefi, John Wallace and Mary W.
Little. Yesterday the fourth amended
coir.p!aint of the plaintiffs was accepted
by the city and the decision rendered.
ThÂ«Â» <f;np!aint traced the title of the
property from the ownership of George
Gordon in 1Sâ¬!>. down through the set
tlement of the various estates to which
It successively was devised. The Rich
ard Wallace estate v, as administered
in Dublin, Ireland, and that of Mary
%T. Uttle in Xew York.
As the municipal budget was based
on a prospective assessment roll of
$465,000,000 with a tax rate of $2.2053 on
every $100, it is apparent that the city
will collect in round numbers $350,000
over and above the total of the vari
ous, appropriations. This money will
lie dormant in the City Treasury, as
under the charter it cannot be used
this year, but must be carried over into
the funds of the next fiscal year. This
directs attention to the apparent de
fect in the charter requiring the fixing
of the tax rate on the last Monday in
June before tluraggregate sum of the
assessment roll is known. The State
law requires the fixing of the tax rate
on the third Monday in September,
and, if the charter did not prevent,
that date would be the logical one, as
the assessment would then be known.
If the tax rate were fixed later it
would result either in a lower tax rate
or the collection of a sum of $350,000 that
could at once be appropriated for pub
lic improvements.
The increased assessment roll is due
to new assessments on franchises of
corporations and banks under a recent
Supreme Court decision; to the raising
of real estate valuations in certain
favored districts, and to additions made
on account of new buildings, which
have been constructed in large num
bers. Some reductions have been made
on old improvements, but these have
been more than offset by the increases.
The roll totals approximately $490,
000,000,' but the additions yet to be
made may raise it to the half-billion
nlark. The estimate of $490,000,000 is an
immense increase over the roll of 1903,
when it was $427,452,110. In 1902 the
assessment was $419,968,466. The in
crease is in conformity with the prom
ise made by Assessor Dodge last year
to the State Board of Equalization
when it raised San Francisco's assess
ment by 30 per cent. Dodge then said
that the roll would show an increase 1
of at least $30,000,000 and he has kept
his word, as it bids fair to exceed, his
own estimate by more than $35,000,000.
Dodge was forced to take this stand
owing to an Implied threat that the
Board of Equalization would again
rai^p this" city's assessment if Its As
sessor did not.
From preliminary calculations made
yesterday In the Assessor's office it
was ascertained that the assessment
roll for this year will aggregate nearly
$500,000,000.
