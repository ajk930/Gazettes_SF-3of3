RUSSIANS CRIPPLE THE WARSHIPS
OF JAPAN IN PORT ARTHUR BATTLE
CZAR'S VLADIVOSTOK FLEET RAIDING 'ALONG JAPANESE COAST
WASHINGTON, Feb. 12.â The Japanese Legation to-night reeeived; the following dispatch under date of Tokio, February 11:
"Two small Japanese merchant ships, the Zensho Maru and Nakanpura, while on their way to Okaru (a port on the western coast of
Yezo Island) from Sakata (a port on the northern coast of the main islan^ of Japan), were fired on February 11 by four Russian men
of-war off the coast of Aimoripore, and the latter merchantman was sunk; while the former had a narrow escape. The Russian men
of-war are still seen off the western coast of Yezo Island. They are supposed to- be first-class cruisers which have been shut* up
at Vladivostok and which tried some time ago to join the main squadron at Port Arthur."

LOXDOX, Feb. 12 (6 p. m.).
The British Government has in
formation which leads to the be
lief that Japan is likely to be
in possession of Port Arthur a
week from now. In the best in
formed Japanese circles here it is

RUSSIA NEEDS MONEY.
PARIS, Feb. 13.â The Berlin
correspondent of the Gaulois says
he learns from a reliable source
that Einperor \Villiam, profiting
by his influence over the Sultan,
has obtained from the Turkish
ruler a formal promise to take no
steps which would create com
plications in the Balkans so lonÂ°*
as the war in the Far East lasts.
It is alleged, the correspondent
continues, that Bulgaria has given
a similar pledge to St. Peters
burg. ' .
The Gil Bias this morning de
clares that the Russian Govern
ment is negotiating with several
banks which are to undertake to
float a new Russian loan in
France, to be issued at 92 and to
bear interest at 5 per cent. The

would have already been accom

causing depreciation in the value
of the existing bonds.

The positions occupied by the Japanese and Russian troops have not clmnged appreciably, so far as
the reports of the operations indicate, but these are extremely meager and clearly show the rigidity of the

VARIAG'S CREW FIND
REFUGE ON FOREIGN
WARSHIPS IN HARBOR
NEW YORK, Feb. 12.â
About 200 of the Variag's crew
lost their lives when the vessel
.was destroyed on Monday by the
Japanese off Chemulpo, according
to a World dispatch from Tokio.
The crew of .the Russian cruiser
numbered 570. Many lost their
lives under fire, but a large num
ber drowned in attempting to es
cape. The rhen loyally aided their
officers, and it is said not one of
the latter was drowned in getting
ashore.
Many swam not to the shore,
but to the foreign men-of-war
in the harbor, which promptly
lowered boats and went to their
rescue. Besides the French cruiser
Pascal, the Italian cruiser Elba
and the British cruiser Talbot
aided the refugees. One hundred
and fifty, many of them wound

WAR EXPERTS BELIEVE
ONLY TWO CONFLICTS
HAVE TAKEN PLACE
NEW YORK. Feb. 12.â Careful study
of reports that have reached America
and Europe from the East, including
press dispatches and communications
through official channels, would Indi
cate but two actual conflicts of any
moment have so far occurred. These
are the Japanese naval attack on Port
Arthur Monday night and Tuesday
morning and the affair at Chemulpo on
Monday and Tuesday. *
Various reports of other engagements
are considered but echoes of these two
fights. News travels slowly in North
Chinn. Cable and telegraph facilities
are limited, and when reports at Port
Arthur and Chemulpo of .affairs reach
various points they are promptly cabled
by resident correspondents, resulting
in a natural confusion of dates. The
report cabled by the Tientsin corre
spondent at London stating that the
Russian fleet hall bombarded Hako
date is entirely discredited. Naval men
in this city say that so far as known
thn only Russian vessels In position to
move are at Vladivostok, and that it
cannot for a moment be thought that
they would be withdrawn from the de
fense of an Important depot, even If
they are free of ice and not blocked by
the Japanese squadron ae has been re

is no cable communication between

Shanghai, it is improbable that such

praises the heroic conduct of the Rus

Large crowds of people are con

NEW YORK, Feb. 12.â The Japanese
troops landed at Gensan are intended
to operate with troops' that have now
been successfully landed at Flngyang
on the opposite â  side of the Korean
penlr.sula, says a dispatch from Kobe,
Japan. . .
These two forces constitute Japan's
second line of defense against tha
Russians who are marching over tha
Yalu into Korea. A first line of de
fense has been arranged. It Is com
posed of picked troops who are lined
up along the south. bank of the Yalu.
It is, however, considered most un
likely that this army will reach its
destination In time to intercept the In
vading Russians.
The second. line may fail -to hold the
invaders, in which case it is expected
that a land battle would take place not
far from Seoul. In any case the Japan
ese preparations are made with a view
to closing in on any body of Russian
troops that succeeds in forcing its way
into the interior of Korea.
Mobilization of the army has been ef
fected without hitch. The transporta
tion of soldiers and supplies by means
of the railway from the interior to the

"On February 9, at noon, cur
fleet advanced into the offing of

rest of the enemy's fleet for about
forty minutes. The result of the
attack is not yet known, but con
siderable damage was inflicted
on the enemy, and 1 believe that
they were greatly demoralized.
They stopped fighting about I

into the harbor. In this action
the damage to our fleet was very
slight, and our fighting strength
is not in the least decreased.
JAPANESE ARE KILLED.
"The number of killed and

Viceroy Alexieff to Have
a Final Word About
the Chinese.
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 12.â An im
perial ukase dated February 10 was
issued to-day. It crmmands that all
the troops in the military districts be
placed in readiness fur war, that all
the divisions in the Far East may be
brought to war strength and that the
army and navy reserves in the Sibe
rian and Kaizan districts be called out
lor active reserve. The authorities are
empowered to requisition the necessary
horses.
Russia is evidently not prepared at
fhis time to grive an answer to the
lTnited States to Secretary Hay's note
â¢ â¢a the subject of the neutrality of
China. As previously stated in these
dispatches, hostilities having begun, the
military authorities must be consulted.
~nd the Czar doubtless will refer the
matter to Viceroy Alexieff, if he has
rot already done so.
Russia, it can be said, is certainly
as anxious as the United States that
the war cause no risings or disorders
in China: indeed, the attitude of China
is already causing some misgivings
here, as she has not declared her neu
trality.
It is thought here that the action of
the Japanese in flooding Peking with
posters relating their victories is part
<>f a well laid campaign projected from
the beginning to break down Russia's
prestige in China for the purpose of
ultimately affecting a union of the two
races, which wouid make the "yellow
peril" a reality. Russia has already
learned of the position taken by scv
rral powers regarding Secretary Hay's
note.
Germany and Great Britain, it is un
derstood, both express sympathy with
its purpose, but with an important res
ervation concerning Manchuria, which
is now the theater of war. Germany's
views in this respect were interested,
but Great Britain fails to give Secre
tary Hay unqualified support and this
has caused surprise here.

nouncing that, on February 11, two
Japanese merchant steamers, the
Xakanoura and Zensho Maru, while
on their way from Sakata to Otaru
(on the island of Hokkaido), were sur
rounded and shelled by four Russian
ships, presumably the Vladivostok
squadron of the coast of Herunshi
(Okushiru). The Nakanoura was sunk,
but the Zensho Maru escaped and ar
rived safely at Fukuyama (island of
Hokkaido).

JAPANESE AND RUSSIANS CONCEAL WAR OPERATIONS
Mystery conliuues to shroud the operations of the sea ami land forces of Japan and Russia, but there
seems no doubt that engagements of a decisive character have already taken place. Kussian warships have
sunk one Japanese merchantman and fired upon another.. Heavy firing has been reported at sea northeast
of Tientsin and the belief exists that a naval engagement has been fought between Japanese and Russian
vessels. A Russian torpedo-boat way blown up by accidentally striking a mine and nearly 100 lives were lost.
The Japanese are endeavoring to destroy the Siberian railway.

received from Viceroy Alexieff
saying that the Russian torpedo
boat Yenisei has been blown up
as the result of accidentally strik
ing a mine at Port Arthur. The
Yenisei sank, and Captain Itep
anoff, three officers and ninety
one men were lost.
The report that Russia is nego
tiating for permission to bring
her Black Sea fleet through ' the
Dardanelles cannot be confirmed
here. In diplomatic circles, while
it is not believed that the Porte
would offer objections to this, the
impression is that, such an at
tempt, would precipitate grave
complications with the powers
signatory to the Dardanelles con
vention.
" It is positively asserted by the
Government that no telegrams
have been received from Viceroy
Alexieff except those already
given' out. It is understood that
even the Czar is expectantly
waiting for . complete direct offi
cial information. The explanation
of the Admiralty for the non
receipt here of direct news - of the
naval battle off Chemulpo, was
a lack of cable connections.
LONDON, Feb. 13.âCom
plete silence has fallen over the
Far East. Not a word of news
is to be had here except the re
port given out at the Japanese
legation of the shelling of the
Japanese merchant vessels by
fcur Russian warships, and the
report from Viceroy Alexieff of
the blowing up of the Russian
torpedo transport Yenisei. This
long, silence has given rise to the
belief that important events are
transpiring.
ATTEMPTS ON RAILWAY. I
A dispatch to the Daily Mirror
from Tokio says the Japanese
have blown up a portion of the
Siberian railroad, but this is prob
ably only a repetition of previous
similar reports.
The Daily Mail learns that the
Japanese will bring into use anew
explosive, which is alleged to be
more powerful than any hitherto
discovered.. /
It is announced that the Im
perial Bank of Russia at St.
Petersburg has raised the rate oÂ£
discount 1 per cent - \^
The, Russian Government has
ssked permission to dock a dis
abled torpedo-boat destroyer at
Suez, but this request was re
fused, as the authorities at Port
Said had surveyed the destroyer
and declared her fit to proceed.
The Sultan received the Rus
sian Embassador to Turkey in
private audience yesterday.
The ' correspondent of the
Times at Weihaiwei, in a dis
patch dated February 11, says the
steamer Fuping, Which is taking
Chinese refugees to Shanghai,
has brought the following ac
count of the Port Arthur battle :
"The garrisons of the Port
Arthur forts were absent from
their stations, so retaliation was
impossible. Daylight showed two
Russian battleships and one
cruiser- apparently total wrecks.
The Japanese attack was resumed
in- the morning, when another
battleship - was disabled 'and
beached. xThe fire from the forts
compelled the Japanese to re
tire. The Russian fleet appeared
to be completely demoralized and
their torpedoes' weic useless
against the Japanese â -â¢-..
'The Fuping, which was flying
the British flag, moved out, after
securing a Russian permit to go.
The guard ship, however, fired
three shells at her, which resulted
in the wounding of five of her
Chinese crew. Captain Gray,
commanding the Fuping, then
boarded the guard ship and ob
tained permission to proceed,
after he had signed a promise not
to divulge what had occurred.
The Russians said they were very
sorry they had fired on his ship."
ENGLAND PREVENTS
SHIPMENTS OF GRAIN
CONSIGNED TO JAPAN
VANCOUVER. B. C, Feb. 12.âFif
teen hundred tons of wheat and barley
foodstuffs , for Japan were unloaded
this afternoon from the royal mail
steamship Empress of China, after
having first been loaded on that vessel,
bound for Yokohama. The ship dis
charged on orders from the British War
Office that she was not to take any
contraband goods from this or any
other port. This is to apply to all naval
reserve steamers on the Pacific in the
British register, and the order will be
maintained while Japan and Russia are
at war. The order that no contraband
shall be carried is applied to all goods
such as foodstuffs, coal or any military
or naval Equipment. The order does
not apply to steamers not in the naval
reserve, which take cargoes at their
own risk. The Canadian Pacific Rail
way,'owners of Empress liners, has
several thousand tons of flour and bar
ley here for shipment immediately to
Japan., Some of this may be taken by
the. Tartar or Athenian, but it is prob
able that consignees will charter a spe
cial steamer to make the trips nec
essary. It is reported that agents of
the Japanese Government are making
arrangements for the purchase of coal
from the Dunsmuir collieries, on Van
couver Island.

HARBIN, Manchuria, Feb. 12.â Tho
announcement of the mobilization of
Russian Jfroops has been received by
the population of this town with en
thusiasm and there is tranquillity and
confidence in the power of Russia, The
Japanese have left the town.
In consequence of the calling out of
reserves and the d-parture cf the Chi
nese there is a lack of workmen and
servants in the mills and factories
which has brought about a restriction
of the output. The price of provisions
is rising daily. The railroad -officials
have requested assistance in order to
send home the families of the Chinese.
The authorities have exhorted the na
tives to have confidence in Russian
protection. Enthusiasm and devotion
to duty prevail among the railroad em
ployes.
Numerous wdmen are offering their
services as nurses. Express traffic
over the railroad has stopped, '.s has
also steamer traffic to Dalny, Shanghai
and Japan.
RUSSIAN MINISTER
AND LEGATION GUARDS
DEPART FROM SEOUL
LONDON, Feb. 12.â The advices of
the Japanese Minister announce that
the Russian Minister at Seoul and the
Russian legation guards have departed
for China. The telegram adds that all
survivors of the Variag and Korutz
and the transport Sunguri were taken
on board the British, French and Ital
ian warships off Chemulpo. This is
the first reference made in Far Eastern
dispatches to the loss of the Sungari, a
Russian transport. Â»
Baron Hayashi. summing up the
events in the Far East, so far as they
have gone, said to-day:
"Whatever may be the eventual re
sult of the war. Russia, in allowing us
to occupy and fortify Masampho, has
created for herself another Darda
nelles. "With fortification of Masampho
the integrity of Japan is assured for
ever. No fleet can now pass there
against Japan's wishes. Even if we
are beaten we would not grive up Ma
sampho."
The Associated Press understands the
Japanese are advancing tcyvard the
Yalu River. There, it is expected, they
will engage Russian forces. The Jap
anese declare the number of Russian
troops i greatly exaggerated. The plan
of the Japanese appears to-be to take
the road which leads almost to Muk
den. They profess to have no doubt
that they will be able to drive back the
Russian forces toward Harbin. Pro
ceeding diagonally, the Japanese intend
to cut the line of communication be
tween Port Arthur and the mainland .of
Manchuria, not only preventing rein
forcements from reaching Port Arthur
garrison, tyit inflicting damage on the
Manchurian Railroad.
The British view that the -Japanese
will In the meantime be able to occupy
Port Arthur Is chiefly based on the
latest information that Russian gtms
cannot be brought to bear on any force
landing at Pigeon Bay, which is on
the western side of Port Arthur, and it
is believed that the Japanese admiral
will follow tactics almost exactly sim
ilar to those pursued at Santiago, the
troops storming the batteries in the
rear, while the Japanese fleet lies wait
ing for the ships of Viceroy Alex
ieff. "which, in the event of a land at
tack being successful, must either
make a dash for liberty or fight where
they are against practically hopeless
odds.
In spite of the lack of news it is con
fidently held here that the Japanese
land forces are actively engaged in a
most important movement, which will
come to a climax as swiftly as did
Japan's first naval attack.

ed from bringing about a sympathetic

COLFAX, Feb. 12.â All trains on the
Southern Pacific are blocked by heav^
snow and landslides and 650 feet of
snow sheds are reported- to have been
damaged. The heavy fall of snow in
the mountains during the last thirty-*
six hours caused snowslldes this after
noon and resultant damage to the sheds
on both sides of the summit. The, most
serious slides occurred "on the eastern
slope of the range, t where more than
400 feet of sjieds were crushed. Two
smaller slides caused breaks of from
fc-rty to seventy-five feet. A landslide
at another point is reported to have
damaged 100 feet of track. Great quan
tities of rock and broken timber were
carried down by the avalanches, ren-.
dering it impossible to use the snow
plows. A trainload of snow shovelers
and track repairers is being rushed
to the scene to clear away the debris.
Superintendent R. J. Laws passed
through on a special train to person
ally direct the work. It is reported
that snow is falling at the rate of ten
inches an hour and hindering the work
of clearing the' track. The east-bound
trains are held at Colfax. with no hope
of proceeding before to-morrow. No
casualties are reported in connection
with the slides. The telegraph and
telephone lines were carried away.
DAMAGE IN MARIN COUNTY.
Railroads Employ Large Crews of Men
to Strengthen Threatened Trestles.
SAN RAFAEL, Feb. 12.â The sever
est rainstorm in many, years has vis
ited Marin County and left consider
able destruction in its wake. In this
city more than 10 inches of rain has
fallen since yesterday noon. Reports
from all sections of the county state
that the precipitation is about as great
in the Interior. Many washouts have
occurred on the North Shore and the
California Northwestern railroads.
Landslides on the Cazadero branch of
the North Shore line delayed the trains
for several hours. In San Rafael many
blocks in the west paVt of town be
low First street are inundated and this
morning several families were com
pletely isolated from land. All the
creeks are terribly swollen and wash
ing away the protecting walls. From
Ross station to Kentfleld the land is
covered with water for several miles.
The roadway between Mulherns and
Kentfleld was so submerged to-day that
it ' was impossible for the hearse of
a local undertaker to reach Larkspur.
As a result the body of "Mr. Adamson
had to be conveyed to the train in an
express wagon. Residents of Kentfleld
and Escalle early tfiis morning used
rowboats fn order to reach the train
en route to San Francisco. Water was
over the fences in that section. The
valuable fruit orchard of Benjamin
Riley in the north of town was en
tirely destroyed by the rising of a
creek.
Up to the present time the damage
to property cannot be- estimated. If
the water continues to rise a far great
er loss will occur.
Mill Valley. Sausalito, Tiburon and
Belvedere also report excessive precip
itation. Both railroads have large
crews of 'men at work strengthening
trestles and building riprap. The Bo-
Unas stage en route to .this city this
morning, had a narrow escape from
destruction. The road was washed out
in many places and at one time a land
slide nearly carried the stage down a
steep precipice. At a late hour to
night the storm shows some signs of
abatement, yet the barometer Is Iowj
TRACKS ARE UNDER WATER.
Travel In Sonoma County Is Tem
porarily Stopped by Storm.
SANTA ROSA, Feb. 12.â The storm
which began here yesterday forenoon
abated at noon to-day, but established
a new record for downpours v in this
city and vicinity. Frftm 10 a; m. Thurs
day until 12 o'clock to-day 5.20 inches
of rain fell here, bringing the total for
the season up to 24.48. At a corre
sponding date last season 22.6S inchoa
had fallen.
The storm caused scr' : incon
venience to travelers from this
city, the Southern Paciflc train
being- :.talled at , El Verano by
the water which covered th t tracks.
Later the train returned here, being
unable to get through. Passengers and
mails were returned, the train backing
into, the local station. The train crew
decided it was too dangerous to run
through the water, the tracks having
been found to be submerged from the
crossing of Sonoma Creek, near Schell
viUe. far. beyond El Verano. The Oc
cidental stage and the rural mail car
rier on 'the Occidental route were kept
in this city to-day by the high water.
They found ' it impossible" to cross the
lagoon either by way of the Sebastdpol
or Forestville roads. Both bridges
were under water and the approaches
were covered for many yards. This
forced the abandonment of the trip.
Russian River,. Mark West Creek
and many other streams were out of
their banks, while Santa Rosa Creek
ran full to the banks. The latter
stream rose rapidly during the night,
the rise being more than six Inches per
hour, for a time. No damage has been
reported from any place in the county
up ti a late hour, and it is believed
none has. ;

be worth hundreds of thousands of dol
lars to it. The storm of to-day dispels
all fear of a drought, insures a good
crop of hay and grain and also benefits
the orchards. Nearly an inch of rain
fell in this city between 4 o'clock this
morning and 5 o'clock this afternoon.
There is every indication that : the
storm will continue for the night. The
rain gauge at the Bank of San Jose
registered '.72 of an inch at 2 o'clock
this afternoon, .50 of which had fallen
after 10 o'clock. This gauge shows
4.92 inches for the season, against 11.5S
inches to the corresponding date of last
year. ~
At other points in the county a heav
ier fall is reported, especially in the
neighborhood of Los Gatos... The creeks
are shoâing an increased amount of
water and the maoy irrigation ditches
leading from them are running full.
During the month of February about
two inches of rain has fallen, and all
this has come in such a manner that it
has sunk into the ground, j Should the
rain continue another twenty-four
hours every stream in the county will
'. . running, bank full. The greatest
need for- rain .wa*s felt on the cattle
rangea in the foothills, but. the rain
this- month has started the grass and
Santa Clara Valley will now have
ple'nty of feed for its stock. The hay
has made % a good t + ~rt. There was an
inclination*to shove the price of hay up
the last two weeks, but the rain will
keep it from soaring higher if not re
duce it. The rain during the present
month has been a great boon to the
nurseries, as there was practically no
sale of fruit trees for planting until the
last rain. With the assurance that any
danger of a drought has been broken
there will be many acres planted to
trees and vines the coming year.

SNOWSLIDES CAUSE
RAILROAD BLOCKADES
Storm Is the Severest Experienced in
â¢February hi Nine Years.
The rainstorm yesterday was the \
most severe that San Francisco has |
experienced in February for nine years.
The rainfall amounted to 2.78 inches.
A depth of more than 10 inches was
registered on the eastern side of Mount
Tamalpais. Shojvers were frequent and }
violent all day throughout Central and !
Northern California. The snowfall was i
unusually heavy in the mountain sec- \
tions. The storm got as far south as \
Fresno and then turned toward the i
east. Last night it was making its
way slowly into Utah and Nevada. !
The water supply for the year will j
be materially increased by the storm, j
according to Professor McAdie of the I
Weather Bureau. Southeasterly winds j
with clearing weather is the prediction
for to-day.
The severity of yesterday's storm was
keenly felt along the central line of
the Southern Paciflc Company, where
considerable damage was done to the
snow sheds and traffic interrupted. Ad
vices received at the office of the man
ager of the company yesterday after- |
noon were to the effect that trouble
was being experienced in the snow
sheds as a result of slides. The storm
showed its strength in the Sierras dur
ing the night and the reports received
at the railroad offices were that the
snow line had extended to Orel, which
is the first station this side of Blue
Canyon. A slide went through the
sheds a quarter of a mile east of the
Butte Canyon bridge, between Crystal
Lake and Cisco. About fifty feet of
the side of the sheds was crushed in.
Work trains were immediately dis
patched to the scene, but it was stated
at the company s offices late yester
day afternoon that it was uncertain
when the blockade would be raised.
Dispatches : received . last evening
stated that several other slides had
occurred along the Central Paciflc line
and that many hundred feet of shed
sidings had been caved in! East of
Smart's there are 300 yards of sheds
down, and if is reported that at Lake*
view 230 yards of sheds have collapsed.' |
Heavy' rains on the mountain sides â 
caused the slides,' .which have not only <
interrupted railroad traffic, but de- j
stroyed telegraphic communication. Aj
large force of men was sent out yes- |
terday by the telegraph companies to
repair 'the damage to their lines." !
Train No. 3. due here yesterday morn- j
Ing, passed through the sheds a short
while before the slide occurred, and
train No. 6, leaving here the night pre- !
vlous, was also successful. Trains Nos.
1 and 5, scheduled to arrive here yes
terday, afternoon, and No. 4, leaving
yesterday morning, were not so fortu
nate and are now in the blockade.

COURT'S DECISION FINAL
Sustains Demurrer of Hawaii
an Millionaire's Widow and
Annuls Gear's Guardianship
SAN JOSE, Feb. 12.â The attempt to
Inaugurate a contest of the will of the
late James Campbell, the Hawaiian
millionaire, was quashed In the Supe
rior Court here to-day. H. L. Gear of
San Franci3co had been appointed
guardian ad litem of the minors, Muriel
and Mary Campbell, and sought to
have a decree of distribution of $180,000
to the tru3t created by the will set
aside and divided among the heirs.
Gear was acting In opposition to Mrs.
Campbell-Parker, mother of the chil
dren, and at his own instigation. In a
demurrer Gear was charged with work
ing in his own interests and against thp
heirs. It is claimed he had obtained his
appointment of guardian by fraud.
Judge Rhodes sustained the demurrer
of Mrs. Campbell-Parker and dismissed
the petition without leave to amend.
He also annulled the appointment of
Gear as guardian. The court declared
had it known that Gear's former ap
pointment had been worked he would
not Have granted the petition. This
ends all action in the contest..

HEAVY RAINFALL IN" OAKLAND
Largest Precipitation for Twenty-four

OAKLAND, Feb. 12.â The country in
the vicinity of Oakland and the neigh
boring towns is flooded by the down
pour of the last twenty-four hours,
and while no great damage was done
serious iesults were narrowly averted
In a number of instances.
The electric train of the new Key
Route ferry service' lost a trip on ac
count of the flooding of Its tracks on
Adeline street, between Emeryville and
Lorin Station. One train had its mo
tors badly burned through their com
ing in contact with the waters on the
track, which were banked up owing
to a cut necessitated by the grading.
The 10 o'clock train was laid off and
workmen succeeded in draining the
flooded section so that the service was
not with interfered with further.
The Oakland Transit Company's en
gine rooms, located at Twenty-fourth

81 years old and had lived In Snoho

was a veteran of the Mexican War.
Twenty years ago he applied for a pen

during a battle he was struck on the
head by a lance and left unconscious

for by Slste*s of Mercy, but his mem
ory of all prior events was completely
gone. Lytle did not know where he
had come from, could not remember
his name and In fact knew nothing
about his former life. To the day of
his death his most Intimate friends
learned nothing from him regarding
his life prior to the Mexican War. He
did not receive his pension until 1SD!>Â»

small shack near Everett, but his
health became poor and he wa3 re

WASHINGTON', Feb. 12.â Senator
Hanna is passing through the climax of
hi* illness. This afternoon it was
feared he was dying, but to-night he
rallied strongly and there is again
some hop* that he may yet win the for
lorn fight. The odds are much againEt
his recovery, but the physique of the
man, aided by oxygen and powerful
s'imulants, brought him through this
afternoon when he was sinking rapidly,
ft it now a question how long the cli
max of the fever will last and how
many and severe will be any further
acute attacks, for to-day's spell was so
pevÂ«=-re that another probably will wit
r^fs the end.
To-day's attack came in the form of
a chill about 2 o'clock and not long
afterward Senator Hanna passed into
unconsciousness, not to return again
until around 6 p. m. At that' time his
pulse ran up to 130 and was so feeble
that it was not perceptible at the wrist.
Three hours later he had shaken off the
attack to such an extent that Dr. Osier,
the Baltimore physician in attendance,
he came from the sickroom at
f:."5 o'clock said there had been a de
cided improvement and that the pa
tient's puls*; was much stronger and
had fallen nearly twenty points.
Miss Mary Phelps. the Senator's
rl^c*. was near at hand when the doc
tor came from the sickroom and when
Fhr heard the announcement of the
rally she asked. "Then you have hope,
<Jr.ctor?" "Hope:" the .doctor replied,
"of course there's hope. When a man
rallied from a sinking spell such as
the Senator had this afternoon and
rhotved such strength afterward there
Is the hest ground for hope."
CHILI, FOLLOWS FEVEK.
The first information from the sick
room In the Arlington Hotel to-day
showed the fever to have attained the
highest point yet reached and the doc
tors looked for the Senator's temper
ature to be at its worst during the fol
lowing forty-eigrht hours, but it un
expectedly lowered as the day wore on
and developments seemed more favor
able. About 2 o'clock in the after
noon, however, the fever was succeed
ed by a suddÂ«n chill, which resulted
in an alarming complication. Power
ful stimulants were promptly applied.
For two hours and a half oxygen was
applied continuously and later more
Irregularly as its good effects began
to manifest themselves. At one time
during the sinking spell the pulse was
scarcely perceptible at the wrist. The
Senator lapsed Into unconsciousness
â¢with the sinking spell. Dr. Carter was
n-Ione with him at the beginning of
the attack, but Drs. Osier and Rlxej*
â¢were summoned and on their arrival
the three worked incessantly with
their patient until .the reaction came,
late in the afternoon.
Before the sinking spell saline so
lutions were given and strychnine in
one-thirtieth grain doses was admin
istered, but much more heroic reme
dies were resorted to during the pe
riod of the acute attack. In the fore
noon the Senator had been well
enough to be shaved.
OXYGEN' IS ADMINISTERED.
The first indication outEide of the
sick room that Senator Hanna had
taken a turn for the worse was when

a drugstore. It became speedily known
that he had gone for oxygen. Mrs.

LOS ANGELES. Feb. 12.â Another
action in the fight of residents of the
East Ninth street district of the city
against the Pacific Electric and Los
Angeles Railway companies for trans
fers haa been taken in the suit of D. S.
Reynblds, who has brought a suit of
mandamus against the officials of the
two .roads to compel them to issue him
transfers. The action was filed before
Judge Conrey of the Superior Court
and it is expected that he will rule on
the matter within the next day or two.
Judge Conrey this morning granted
the writ of mandamus asked for and
set the date of hearing for next Friday.
The order of the court cites the defend
ant companies to appear in court on
that date and show cause why a per
manent order should not be issued com
pelling them to Issue transfers to and
from the East Ninth street car line for

This will have the effect of bringing

of the East Ninth street district and

question of transfers to an immediate

hurried to the bedside of her husband,
where 6he remained constantly
throughout the period of greatest dan

the hotel for oxygen Miss Phelps, the 1
Senator's niece, came hurriedly Into the
lobby of the hotel and summoned H.
M. Hanna, a brother, to the Senator,
to the apartments upstairs. She re
mained and sent some dispatches.
The news quickly spread that the
Senator was in a Einking condition and
the number of callers and inquiries,
which had come in greater number to
day than at any time previously, were
vastly augmented. Subsequently Mr.
Dover, the Senator's secretary, an
nounced to the newspaper men that he
had just sent telegrams to the rela

announcing that an unexpected change
for the worse had taken place and that
the patient's condition was critical.
Those outside waited apxiously, but for
several hours all reports "were decidedly
discouraging. The attack yielded so
slowly and so s'tubbornly to the power
ful stimulants administered that the
gravest fears began to be entertained
that the end might not be far removed.
RECOVERS CONSCIOUSNESS.
Shortly before 7 o'clock Secretary
Dover announced that the Senator had
recovered consciousness some time
before, and said that he had tried
several times to speak to Dr. Osier,
but was too weak. The doctors asked
him to aid them In the application of
the oxygen by taking deep breaths. He
did as directed, thus showing that he
fully understood what was said. It was
also announced that the heart action
was better and that the temperature
had lowered. A little later it was an
nounced that the patient had taken a
little nourishment, including some di
luted whisky, and had retained it. The
bulletin announcing the reaction and
improved condition gave relief to the
large number of the Senator's friends,
who were in his office and in the cor
ridor of the Arlington.
A greater portion of the Ohio dele
gation called to-day, a long list of Sen
ators and members of the House,
among them Senators Spooner. Lodge,
Keane. Platt of Connecticut, Elkins and
Representatives Payne and Dalzell.
Among the members of the Cabinet
who called were Secretaries Taft and
Cortelyou and Postmaster General
Payne. General Dick of Ohio was one
of the first to arrive after the change
in condition was noted and he remained
until late. .
The President and Mrs. Roosevelt
called during the afternoon. Mrs.
Roosevelt was with Mrs. Hanna when
the doctors, at noon, announced an im
proved temperature. The President
came later and remained in the Sen
ator's apartment nearly half an hour,
when he was fully advised of the con
dition of the Senator at that hour. He
ha<l not been gone long when the
change occurred.
PATIENT RESTS EASIER.
oenator Hanna, as the night wore
on, continued aÂ£~ least to hold the rally

ooctors said that the indications are
that the S nator would ..avc a quiet
and comfortable night. T. cy said that

most of the night, awaken!ng at In

The physicians say the chill Irom
whic!. the Senator suffered Is quite un
usual in typhoid cases and has but
f*w precedents. It does not follov,
they say, that another is likely to oc
cur and for this reason they are in
clined to hope there may not be fur

A pathetic feature of Senator, Han
na's iJlness is the receipt of a number
of telegrams of condolence with his
family, based on reports of his death
which have been printed in newspapers
in the East and West.
WATCHING FOR CHANGE.
At 11:45 to-night President Roose
velt sent a personal message of in

that the Senator's condition at - mid

Court to-day In the suit of James Mc-
Holme against the California Deposit

been selling bonds for the company and
he claimed there was $171 due him as

of the company were engaged in an un
lawful and nefarious business and had
no standing in court. The company
was denounced as engaged in a swind

as being on a par with the sale of gold
bricks. Mcliolme's position was lik

IN FAVOR OF THORNTON
Administrator of the Estate of Ben

to Valuable Property.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 12. â The title to
143 acres of valuable land in San
Mateo County was decided by Judge
Rhodes to-day in favor of R. S. Thorn
ton. Some time ago. an action was
brought by George W. Greene, as ad
ministrator of the estate of Benjamin
S. Greene, to quiet title to the tract of
land. Besides this an accounting for
rent of the land was also asked. The
action was based on a certain docu
ment executed by Benjamin Greene to
R. S. Thornton in 1872. It was con

gage, though a deed in form. The
court found that Benjamin S. Greene
was not the owner nor had any title
in the property at the time of the
execution of the deed to Thornton and
that the latter has held it and paid
taxes on it for years. It Is also held
that if the plaintiff had any cause of

GREEN WAY BALL
ECLIPSES ITS
PREDECESSORS
By- Sully Sharp.
Does Ned Greenway ever do things
by halves? About his functionsâ all of
themâ there ia a' grasp of detail that
renders them distinctive from their fel
lows.
Decidedly we have no need for Harry
Lehr while Mr. Greenway holds the reins
of our social government. His reign
of the season Just overâ and last night
finished the season (except for the
Mardi Gras), was the most brilliant
of many brilliant winters.
The white and gold ballroom was re
splendent with ruby lanterns, gayly
swung from pillar to pillar, round
which were twined long green garlands,
studded with bloodred roses. Yes, and
there were othersâ the alternating fes
toons; \hese were entwined with glit
tering bands of gold, which likewise
hung resplendent from the gigantic
basket of red roses in the center over
to the frieze. Woodwardia and Its les
ser sisters completed the exquisite set
ting. These, too, were used in the Con
servatory room, where the punch bowl
reposedâ which spot, by the. way,
proved immensely popular as the ball
grew apace. Palms and punch and
yawning divans â these are assuredly
alluring at any dance.
The music wasâ as ev%r at^Greenway
functionsâ superlatively good, issuing
from a latticed bower at the west end.
Rather late were half of the 300
guestsâ sixty of whom dined in the
Marble room as the guests of Mr. and
Mrs. Joseph D. Grant. This dinner was
one' of the most elegantly appointed
affairs of the season's end. Pink was
the color scheme of the dinner.
-As to the gowns there were . many
that bore the smart crispriess of recent
acquisition. Among the. many that did*
herewith are a few:

ent gown of lavender chiffon, aglitter

REPORTS ON THE DEATH
OF MACHINIST JOHNSON
Commander Heilner Informs Navy
Deportment of Circumstances
Attending the Killing.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 12.âCommand
er Lewis C. Heilner of the United States
steamship Yankee has reported at
length to the Navy -Department the
circumstances surrounding the death
of Machinist Johnson on February 1.
when the launch of the Yankee was
fired upon by insurgents at San Do
mingo City. His report says:
Â» "The circumstances attending the
death of Johnson, machinist, second
class, are as follows: I had made ar
rangements with the Consul General
and Charge d' Affaires to send a boat
to the landing in case there was no
firing on the. line, as they wished . to
visit the ship.- On the morning of
February 1 I received a message by
wigwag signal from the Minister to the
effect that all was quiet and sent a
steam launch In charge of the chief
petty officer with instructions to go to
the landing and bring off the Consul.
When the boat entered the river the
firing was going on. The boat kept on
her way to the landing, and while
making a landing the machinist was
struck by a bullet in the brain. After
the launch had left the ship I received
a message from the Charge d'Affaires,
Mr. Powell, informing me that the fir
ing was going on and not to. send a
boat. By the time I received the mes
sage Johnson had been wounded. It
Is utterly impossible from the anchor
age to determine when firing is going
on in the river and I depend upon mes
sages from ashore for that informa
tion." . .

PASSENGER
TRAIN HAS
CLOSE CALL
Ties Placed on Broad - Gauge
Track Near Santa Cruz Are
Discovered Just in Time to
Prevent a Great Disaster
TWO SUSPECTS ARE
NOW IN CUSTODY
Place Selected for \ Attempt
Is, Near a Trestle and Only
Engineer's Vigilance Saves
Many From an Awful Death
Special Dispatch to The Call.
â¢ SANTA CRUZ, Feb. 12.â A dastardly
attempt was made this morning to
wreck the 11:15 outgoing Southern Pa
cific broad-gauge passenger train at
Corcorans Lagoon, about two miles
from Santa Cruz. This Is one of the
worst places along the road. It Is at
a curve, down grade and near a trestle.
A couple of ties had been wedged be
tween the rails Just before the ap
proach to the trestle. At the place
where the ties were laid is a fill twenty
feet high and the trestle over the la
goon Is about the same height. The
train was coming at a great speed,
but luckily Engineer Williams saw the
obstruction and applied the emergency
brakes. I
The train ran into the ties but was
not ditched. The engine and two bag
gage cars passed over the ties, causing 1
a heavy jolting before the train came
to a standstill. When stopped the train
was partly on the trestle. It was with
some difficulty that the track was
cleared. The accident might have been
serious as the train was crowded with
passengers. At Capltola Sheriff Traf
ton was notified and with Under Sheriff
Horton went to the scene of n the at
tempted wreck.
It Is thought the placing of the ties
was tne spite work of some tramp put
off the train. Shortly before 1 o'clock
two tramps were seen near the scene
of the wreck and were placed under
arrest. They were well dressed, were
not inclined to talk and gave their
names as John Manning and F"red Bol
len. At present they are in the County
Jail.
The local officials of the Southern
Pacific Company last evening denied
all knowledge of any unusual Inci
dent along the route between here and
Santa Cruz during the day. Master of
Transportation Richardson declared
that he had had no report from Santa
Cruz regarding the finding of ties on
the track of the local and 'remarked
that if anything of a serious character
had happened the fact would have
been called to his attention.
TRIVIAL QUARREL NEARLY
CAUSES SHOOTING AFFRAY
Former Physician to Ex-Queen LIlluo
kalani Defends Himself From At
tack and Is Arrested.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 12. â Because
he defended himself from the attack
of T. N. Fields, an athlete, by. covering
"him with his revolver Dr. Charles H.
English of Washington, D. C, who
made a name for himself in Honolulu
and is well known in San Francisco
and other large cities, was arrested
this evening on a charge of displaying
firearms in a threatening manner.
After the arrest of Dr. English Fields
purchased a revolver and, stationing
himself at his mother's rooming-house,
declared! he would kill English on sight.
A policeman found him there, dis
armed him, after a struggle, and placed
him in jail without bail. The cause of
the trouble which nearly developed into
a tragedy was a trivial quarrel between
Dr. English and Mrs. Fields, at whose
rooming-house the doctor was staying.
The woman's son took up the matter
and started to throw Dr. English down
stairs when the latter drew a revolver
and with it compelled his assailant to
leave the house. -Mrs. Fields then
caused the arrest of English and he
was soon released on bail. When he
returned to his room he was warned
that Fields had armed himself and
threatened to kill him on sight. A
policeman was summoned and Fields
was arrested. English says he will
prosecute him vigorously for threaten
ing to murder him.
Dr. English became " prominent in
Honolulu as the private physician to
ex-Queen Lilluokalani. He Is well
known to prominent Washington peo
ple and has held some responsible pro
fessional positions. *â Â£*?*. i

NEWS OF THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA
FINDS A RARE
OLD MANUSCRIPT
Mrs. Delia Nutall. Mexican
Archaeologist, Discovers An
cient Work iu a Library
PUBLISHED IX BOOK FOKM
Tells the Story of Spamsh-
American Traveler of Three
Hundred Years iu the l'ast
Berkeley Off.ce San Franciscir Call,
â¢ 214S Center Street. Feb. 12.
The library of the University of Cali
fornia has just received the tirst vol
ume of a valuable work by Mre. Delia
Xutail. a special agent for the univer
sity Ea Mexican archaeological research
ar.d the protege of Mrs. William Crock
er and Mrs. Whitelaw Reid. The book
cootmfzia the original manuscript cf the
account of the travels of a Spanish-
American tourist in Mexico in 1601.
Mrs. Nutall found the book in a library
in Florence ten years ago and has since
jJevoted much of her time to a transla
tion and description of it.
. The volume now printed is a hand
gome example of the printer's handi
craft and is most quaint in its design.
The engraving was all done in Flor
ence, as the authorities there would
rot permit the book to go out of their
posseeskta. There are eighty r*as?s of
fat- similes, not only of the manuscript
itself but of interesting drawings of
objects the writer Â»%'Â»v in his travels.
Among those drawings are pictures of
Aztec human sacrificial altars, mor
tuary costumes, and most interesting
of all. the Artec sweat baths, which
in :h<* day* of Artec civilization were
highly valuable for their curative pow
en. The rights and ceremonies of the
Aztecs are fully described in theÂ«.e pic
tures.
Another interesting thing in the
book is Mrs. Xutalls account of the
manner in which she prepared the re
vision of the Aztec calendar, about
i\hkh thtr" had previously been much
mystery.
The second volume of the work will
contain a translation of the account
In the manuscript of the traveler's ob
servations and journeys. This is now
in prepr.ratk-n and will be here in a
few months. â¢

WATER COMPANY
MAKES A REPLY
Kemarkable Document Is Sent
to the Individual Members
of the Oakland City Council
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Feb. 12.
The Bay Cities Water Company to
day mailed to, the Individual members
of the City Council a statement of the ]
conditions on which It would be willing
to make a second offer to supply the
city of Oakland with water. According
to this circular letter the water com
pany is not satisfied with the treatment
accorded it by the special water com
mittee or by Desmond Fitzgerald, the
engineer, who made the report com
demning its properties. Before submit
ting a second offer the Bay Cities Com
pany asks that the Mayor be allowed to
name two engineers, these to name a
third, to report on its property. The
conclusion reached by these three en
gineers will be accepted, the letter
states, by the company.
The following extracts from the long
statement give the gist of the offer:
The Bay Cities Water Company is In receipt
of a certified copy of a resolution adopted by
your honorable body at a meeting the 16th of
January, requesting it to present a new offer
cf water supply.
. The Introduction cf this resolution relates
that under date of January ti the Bay Cities
Water Company formally withdrew Its propo
sition dated August 12. 1903.
The rrk.<on given by this company In its
communication to you precluded the further
consideration of Its proposition by the City
Council. The preposition had not been con
sidered in Its entirety, either by your consult
ing engineer cr by your special committee,
and upon Its withdrawal was not open to ac
ceptance or rejection.
NctwithstnndinK the forejroinK and an agree
ment with the chairman of your ppeclal com
mittee that he would withhold his report to
the Council, pending the receipt of a nÂ»w
proposal, and that he would present, â  on the
ltoth of January. Â» resolution Inviting 1 this
company to'Fubmtt to his committee a new
preposition In vlrw cf the withdrawal of' the
old one. your siÂ»eclal committee, at that meet
ing cf "the Council, reported In detail on this
company's proposition, condemning it and
presented th* report of your consulting engi
neer condemning It. recommended to the city
of Oakland the acceptance of a proposition for
the furnishing of water by a compiling com
pany to the Bay Cities Water Company, anrt
asked that the- committee bÂ» discharged from
further consideration of the subject, and that
further projects brought to the attention of the
City Council be submitted to a new commit
ted.
The .submission of a new proposal by this
company was promised upon a condition ot
affairs which would have enabled your Council
to have glvm it unbiased consideration. Such
condition we believe, has been destroyed by
the action of your special committee, and^ we
could not bÂ« reasonably expecjed to submit
any reposition basrd upon a property to the
condemnation of which so large ft part of your
body *o publicly committed itself, until proper
provision has been mad?, establishing condi
tions under which a new proposition cannot be
condemned because of anything which has
transpired, and will be properly investigated
and considered on ttu merits. ,
The Bay CltieÂ« Water Company Is still de
sirous of submitting a proposition to the city
of Oakland, but In view of Its late experience
and in justice to its property, it feels that,
with all due respect to your honorable body,
the submission of a new proposition should be
haÂ«d on an understanding beforehand as to
the means by which HÂ»EhalI be. considered and
reported upon.
The Bay Cities Water Company, if so de
slrfcd by the Common Council, would be plessed
to submit to consideration a new offer
of such a supply, contemplating the purchas*
or rental of the necessary works, or the pur
chase of water by the million gallons.'- or any
or all that may be made legally binding on
both parties.

CHAIRMAN AND PRINCIPAL
SPEAKER AT THE KANT
COMMEMORATION.
BERKELEY, Feb. \2.â In commemo
ration'of the one hundredth anni
versary of the death of lmmanuel Kant,
the- Philosophical Unfon lof the Uni
versity of California held special exer
cises this evening in the philosophy
building at the university. The rain
and counter attractions kept many
away from the meeting, but quite a
number of those interested in philo
sophical discussions gathered to hear
the address of the evening by Professor
George H. Howison on "Kant's Legacy
to Philosophy."
Professor Howison was introduced by
Professor Charles Mills Gayley, who
acted as chairman. Professor Gayley
addressed himself briefly in opening the
meeting to a review of Kant's life.
Kant was born in Germany In 1724, the
son of a saddler of Scotch descent. He
died in 1S04, one of the greatest and
most- influential German metaphy
sicians. He studied philosophy, mathe
matics, physics, theology and other
subjects at the university of his native
town of Koenigsberg and after getting
his degree lectured. His early life was
a struggle for recognition". In 1762 he
was offered the chair of poetry at
Koenigsberg. but declined it because he
felt himself unfit for the office. The
next year he accepted a place as as
sistant librarian at , a salary of 62
thalers and though he had" become well
known and esteemed for his scholarship
did not obtain a professorship until
1770. His private life was uneventful;
he did not marry and did not travel.
Professor Howison reviewed Kant's
philosophy and its influence upon
philosophical students since his death.
According to Professor Howison Kant's
philosophy developed slowly. His views
did not seem to take anything like final
form until he wrote his greatest work
In 17S1. By this time he had effected in
philosophy what he called a Copernican
revolution. "Our suggestion," Kant
said, "is similar to that of Copernicus
in astronomy, who, finding it impossible
to explain the movements of the
heavenly bodies on the supposition
that they turned around the specta
tor, tried whether he might not succeed
better by supposing the spectator to
revolve and the stars to remain at
rest."
Kant's ethics are frequently^ called
rlgoristic, that Is. it refuses to recognize
the moral value of natural Inclinations.
His services in the theory of science
were probably as great as in the realm
of philosophy. He anticipated Laplace
in the view that the solar system has
developed from a primitive gaseous ma
terial with rotary motion.
Xoyal's Masquerade.
Loyal Rebekah j Lodge. I. O. O. F.,
had a masquerade ball in Scottish Hall
last night which proved to be one of

were decidedly original. The prize win
ners were Florence and H. GiovanessI,
Eolo M. Cyrus,. Thursey Barrett, Rena

After unmasking dancing was kept up
until I midnight. The committee that
conducted this affair was Tillie Craig,

ney, J. Carren and Frank Higgins.

Dr. Jessica Peixotto Talks to
Students of the University
About Social Settlements
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call
214S Center Street, Feb. 12.
Social settlement work as conducted
in. West Berkeley furnished the theme
for three speakers this morning at the
semi-monthly meeting of the students
of the University of California. Dr.
Jessica Peixotto of the economics de
partment. Dr. E. C. Moore, professor
in education, and Hart Greensfelder,
editor of the Occident and resident di
rector of the West Berkeley social set
tlement, were the speakers.
"Social settlements are not charities,"
said Dr. Peixotto. "They are co-opera
tive. They teach the educated people
the value of labor and how-to labor.
They teach the people connected with
them useful trades and occupations
and independence. In France the so
cial settlement problem has been
worked out in such a way that the
benefited feel that they are above be
ing mere charity wards. The system
is gaining ground in America all the
time and is one of our most valued ed
ucational Institutions."
â¢ Dr. Moore and Mr. Greensfelder de
scribed the work being carried on in
West Berkeley, where several hundred
young men and girls are being edu
cated. The burden of maintaining the
institution is borne mainly by Mrs.
Hearst.

Court Takes Into Considera
tion Fact That He Made
Restitution So Far as Possible
Oakland Office San Francisco, Call.
111S Broadway. Feb. 12.
For the theft of $30,000 W. A. 2Jc-
Kowen, late secretary of the Board of
Regents of the University of Califor
nia, was sentenced to-day to spend six
years and eleven njonths in San Quen
tin prison.
McKowen went to court this morn
ing and took his seat beside his at
torneys, Peter F. Dunne and H. M.
Wriglit. He was composed and evi
dently nerved for the ordeal which he
had to undergo-. When Superior Judge
S. P. Hall called McKowen's case At
torney Dunne arose and asked the in
dulgence of the court.
"It is right that this court should
know that this defendant has made all
restitution in his power," said Mr.
Dunne. "He has turned over to the
proper persons something over $4000 in
real estate and several hundred dol
lars in money. He has dene this vol
untarily and has stripped himself of
everything in the way of property.
More than that, he has not stood, in
the way of the law. He has entered
his plea here and has relieved the au
thorities, from the delay, the uncer
tainty and the expense of a public
prosecution. He has done everything
that could be done or could be expected
from a man in his position."
In passing sentence upon McKowen.
Judge Hall said: /
"Mr. McKowen, it is not necessary
for me to call your attention to the
deplorable condition in which you now
find yourself. Since your case has come
up before me, and my attention has
been called to you, I think I have no
ticed something in you that indicates
repentance for the enormity of your
offense.
"I shall not give you the extreme
limit of ten years allowed by law. as
I do not think in your case that the
maximum penalty Is necessary. I have
also taken into consideration the fact
that you aske.dÂ» to be sentenced some
weeks ago, but it could not be done at
that time.
"It is the order of this court that
you be sentenced to a term of six years
and eleven months in San Quentin
prison."
It is probable that McKowen will be
taken to San Quentin to-morrow. He
refused to- express himself in regard
to his sentence, but his attorneys were
satisfied that his punishment was as
light as could have been asked. With
credits it will be four years and nine
months.

Heavily Armed. Pounce Down
Upon Game Players, Bind

SEIZE BANK ROLL
AND MANY DIAMONDS

house, Joe Schreiber and John
Lyous Are Losers by Visit
of tho Desperate Criminals
One of the most daring robberies
ia the history of crime in this city and
equaled only by the exploits of the
notorious Jesse James gang was per
petrated shortly after midnaght. when
five armed men, their features con
cealed by black masks, entered the
rooms of the Colonial Club at 133
Powell street and secured money and
Jewelry aggregating $10,000 In value.
Kight members of the club were in
the rooms at the time and they were
t:ed hand and foot by the desperadoes.
The robbers were entirely familiar
with the interior arrangement of the
rooms and knew where the bank roll
was kept and In whose possession the
keys could be found. They joked with
their victims and were accommodating
enough to loosen the cords when one
man said they were too tight.
A quarter past 12 o'clock Joe
Schreiber. John Lyons, Clarence Water
house, Jerry Quill, Billy Engstrom,
Joe Harlan, Russ Flint and a man
named Heath were sitting around one
of the many tables in the clubrooms
engaged in playing whist. The game
had just been finished and it was
suggested that one more should be
played. The cards had hardly been
dealt when there came a loud knock
trn the door opening into the hall.
BOLD GUESTS ENTER.
Joe Harlan went to the door and
threw it open, only to be confronted by
four masked men and as many ugly
looking revolvers of heavy caliber.
The quartet entered the room and or
dered, "Hands up!" Eight pairs of
hands shot ceilingward in an instant.
The eight men were then ordered to
Ftand with their faces toward the
northerly wall of the room. Heavy
i-ord was then produced and the vic
tims wore bound hand and foot and
ranged face downward on the floor.
Upon entering the room one of the
bandits said. "Get the guy with the
light coat. He has the keys." This
referred to Harlan, who wore a plaid
Fmokingr jacket. Harlan before being
tied endeavored to get a glimpse of
one fellow's face and received a blow
from the butt end of a pistol for his
pain?. One of the quartet declared in
a gruff tone that 'This is no limit
game, and we want it all."
Harlan's pockets were searched for
the keys to a desk in the front room.
These were secured and one of the
men lost no time in getting the bank
roll, consisting of $5500. All of the
crooks were cool and collected and ap
peared to be in no hurry. Two in par
ticular seemed very cool, as if the trick
were not new to them.
While two stood guard the others
went through the prostrate forms.
From Jce Schreiber, one of the pro
prietors, $200 was secured. John
Lyons was relieved of 52 85, a. diamond
Ftud and ring. From Clarence Water
house, the well known member of the
lacing firm of Burns &. Water house,
they took S1000 in bills and a thou
sand-dollar diamond ring. Jerry
Quill parted with a diamond stud and
diamond ring valued at $500. Billy
Engstrom lost $300 and a diamond
ring. From Ituss Flint they took $40
and a diamond locket. Heath was
not compelled to part with any of his
valuables.
CRIME WELL PLANNED.
The entire affair was characterized
by the greatest coolness on the part of
the robbers and was the result of a
v.ell formulated and cleverly executed
plan- While the four were operating
in the room another member of the
gang stood guard in the hallway. The
masks worn were made of some soft
black material, in which holes had
been cut. All were armed with what
appeared to be 44-caliber revolvers,
and one carried in addition a murder
ous looking bowic knife, which he
wielded in a threatening manner.
After completing their work two of
the men walked out of the door lead
into into the hallway. The other two
then walked to ' the electric light
switch and one of them turned off the
electric lights. When the room was
in darkness they silently vanished
through the door. Clarence Water
house was the first one to free him
relf from his bonds and quickly cut
the cords which bound his compan
ions.
The police were immediately notified
pnd Patrolmen Meredith, Haj'den and
Matheson responded. Detectives Silva
ar.d Ross Whi taker were dispatched
to the scene from the Central station.
There is absolutely no clew to the in
trepid crook3, but it Isi thought that
they are race track followers. They at T
tracted no attention upon entering or
iea\'inj? the" hou^e and the description
given'is- meager.

BITTER WORDS
FROM MORGAN
Senator Attacks Policy of
the President With Refer
ence to an Isthmian Canal
CAUSES A GREAT STIR
Miss Alice Roosevelt, Who Was
in Gallery of Senate, Leaves
Her Seat in Angry Mood
Special Dispatch to The Call.
call bureau; hotel barton,
WASHINGTON, Feb. 12.â The Senate
to-day listened to the reading by Sen
ator Carmack of a speech prepared by
Senator Morgan, In opposition to the
President's policy with reference to an
Isthmian canal, and also considered the
bill appropriating 5200.000 to ex-Queen
Lllluokalanl of -Hawaii. Spooner moved
to recommit the measure, but the vote
on his motion failed to develop a quo
rum, so the Senate was forced to ad
journ.
"The President has taken a course
which would have cost the King of
Great Britain his crown, if not his
head," thundered Senator Carmack
during the reading of Senator Morgan's
speech, causing a movement in the
diplomatic gallery. Miss Alice Roose
velt, accompanied by several other
young women, arose from the front
seats they had been occupying and left
Miss Roosevelt's face was slightly
flushed, but she held her head high. Her
friends followed laughing and joking
her on her anger.
The sentence was the climax of the
severe arraignment Senator Morgan
had made of President Roosevelt. As
the Alabama Senator was unable to
make himself heard because of a sore
throat Senator Carmack read ' his
speech. No Senator on the minority
side arraigns the President more bit
terly in his speeches than does Car
mack. and he read Morgan's words
with great gusto. Miss Roosevelt had
brought some friends to the Capitol and
they were being shown about by Sen
ator Kean. They entered the diplo
matic gallery not long before Carmack
arose and were, of course, unaware
that they were to hear one of the
rtrongest personal criticisms of Presi
dent Roosevelt which have been heard
in the Senate this year.
CAXXOX BREAKS RECORD.
Dispatches Private Pension Bills in
Quick Order in the House.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 12.â Speaker
Cannon to-day took the bit in his
teeth and ran completely away with
legislative precedent in the House. In
cidentally he broke all previous records
in the dispatch of private pension
bills. Under his guidance 320 of these
: leasures of relief were passed by the
House In 155 minutes. Nearly the
whole of this time was consumed in
committee of the whole. The House
passed the bills "en Hoc" under unan
imous consent, which the Speaker him
self asked for.
About half of the bills were disposed
of under this request, those without
amendment. When otjection was
temporarily made the Speaker plainly
showed his displeasure by dragging
the proceedings. The objection was
withdrawn, whereupon the remaining
bills v.ere declared passed without even
the.formality of having the clerk read
their -numbers.
EXECUTES WILL
BEFORE DEATH
Nineteen days before her death Mrs.
H. A. Floyd Gopcevic, the wealthy
daughter of the late Captain R. S.
Floyd, a retired naval officer, who, in
October last, after a romantic court
ship, became the wife of M. M. Gop
cevic, a gripman on the Sacramento-
Ftreet cars, made her last will and tes
tament. This fact was made known
yesterday by the filing of a petition for
special letters of administration upon
the estate of the deceased. These letters
were ordered issued by Judge Kerrigan
in Department 10 of the Superior Court
to Henry E. Matthews, the lifelong
friend of the deceased's father and
mother and of deceased herself, and
to Pedar M. Gopcevic, the dead
lady's brother-in-law, who are the
two persons named in the will as the
exocutorp. The bonds of the petitioners
wÂ«re fixed at $10,000 each.
The attorneys for Gopcevic and
Matthews are Judge John F. Davis and
Bishop, "Wheeler & Hoeffler.
The petition for special letters re
cites that Mrs. Gopcevic died Febru
ary 11, leaving an estate which pro
duces an "income of $2500 a month
and which needs the care of a special
administration.
It recites further that on January
23, 1903, nineteen days before the
'death of Mrs. Gopcevic, she made a
will in which she named her hus
band's brother and Matthews as ex
ecutors.
The estate left by Mrs. Gopcevic is
J a large one. which she inherited from
j her mother, Mrs. Cota. L. Floyd, who
i died in 1893. Mrs. Floyd stipulated
! in her will that the estate should be
j left in trust. Mrs. Gopcevic. who was
at that time unmarried, tried to break
the will, but failed in her efforts to do
so, po that the estate is still held in
trust.
! â¢ It consists of valuable properties lo
j catcd in different parts of the State
i and is valued at somewhere in the
j vicinity of $750,000.
I The will, which Is reported to be
I holographic in form, is concise and
simple. The young husband is said
to come in for a very large share of
the estate, and Miss Elisa G. Prich
srdj her friend and devoted compan
ion of many years, is bequeathed the
! beautiful home at 2833 Sacramento
street, as well as being also hand
! somely remembered otherwise.
The immediate cause of Mrs. Gop
cevic's death was an attack of meas
les, which, coming when she was in
a particularly delicate state of health,
resulted fatally. The funeral will be
held this morning at 3:45 o'clock
from the Greek Russian, church on
1 Powell street, near Filbert.

PUBLICATION MAKES KNOWN
RICHES OF MARIPOSA MINES
State Mining Bureau Issues Map and Register.
Kern County Stirs With Reviving Interest
in the Development of Resources in Quartz
The mines and mineral wealth of
Marlposa County supply a theme for
a bulletin that has just been issued by
State Mineralogist Aubury. With it
is Issued a map^of the county, which,
like those supplied previously for other
counties, gives an abundance of de
tails relative to county mineral loca
tions, the trails and roads by which
the same are most directly arrived at,
the distances from towns and means
of transportation.
Mariposa is a large county. Its
area is 1580 square miles. In 1903 its
assessed value w,as $2,270,146. The
population was 4720 in 1900. That is
probably about the- present popula
tion. The county extends from the
edge of the San Joaquin Valley in an
easterly direction to the summit ,of
the Sierras, a distance of about sixty
miles. The area embraces the drain
age basin of the headwaters of the Mer
ced River. The elevation ranges from
about 500 feet above sea level to about
11,000, with an average in the min
ing region â which is the most thickly
populated part of the county â of about
2000 feet. â¢ â 
Mining is the principal industry of
the county. Several mills are kept
running to turn yellow pine and sugar
pine groves into lumber. The higher
and more mountainous part of the
county is little developed. The tim
ber, thereon Is protected by the Gov
ernment. The gold the county yields
comes almost entirely from the free
milling quartz bodies of the mother
lode.
The lode consists of several more or
les continuous quartz veins. It enters
the county near Penon Blanco and can
be traced in fl. southeasterly direction
nearly through the county. Its aver
age dip is about 65 degrees tpward the
northeast. There are scattering mines
to the west of the mother lode, some
of which have produced gold and cop
per. In what is known as the east
belt the greater part of the mining
operations east of the mother lode
have been carried on. The veins are
found on the east belt in varying Blze's
and positions. The east belt bodies are
smaller than those of the mother lode,
but they are of higher grade.
METHODS OF MIXING.
Of the several methods of mining
that have been in vogue in the county
the State Mineralogist reports:,
Placer mining, which originally opened the
county's resources, is now practically given
up, as most of the gravel deposits have been
carefully washed. Pocket mining supports a
considerable number .of persons, and many
small pockets are taken out during the year.
Such properties require but little outlay of
capital and are often held unpatented and
worked by the owners or under royalty. Hy
draulic mining has never achieved much im
portance in the county, although there are
bodies of gravel which could be washed by the
proces?. Granite, marble and limestone are
found in abundance.
In the operation of mines and mills wood
and water are depended on for power. Wood
is becoming eThausted In many places and
costs from $4 to $5 per cord, delivered at the
mines. Electricity Is being used by the Alarf-
I>o--a Commercial and Mining -Company on the
Marlpoya grant. They generate their own
power from the waters of the Merced River
at Ragby. Most of the quartz mines are
workol through inclined shafts, which follow
the vein. Opening the veins by vertical shafts,
however", has not proven always practicable.
The ground ordinarily stands well and timber
ing is thus not expensive. Such iimlier as is
needed along the mother lode comes mostly
from the pine regions to the east.
In 1301 gold to the value of 5504,928
was produced, silver worth 54787 and
lead 530S0. In 1902 the mineral pro
duction of the ccrunty included 5631,478
in gold, $3S80 in silver and 511.940 in
copper.
The Dunsmuir Xews tells of a great
deposit of talc not far from Dunsmuir,
more commonly ' known as soapstone.
The property will be mined. One com
pany owns 360 acres of talc bearing
land.
According to the Calaveras Pros
pect, a deposit of good marble has been
found in Calaveras County near Doug
las Flat.
Three miles of the Cottonwood Creek
gravel beds have been bonded by a
dredging company that will search for
gold.
A company is being formed to open
up copper deposits in Nevada County,
near Newtown.
The Grass Valley Tidings says that
recent purchases, added to previous
holdings, have given the Alleghany
Mining Company, operating near the
town of Alleghany, Sierra County. 1110
acres of mining land in one continu
ous strip between five and six miles
along the Keystone, Red and Blue Lead
channels.
The Nevada City Transcript reports
that the Oriental tunnel has tapped the
ledge at a distance of 3500 feet from
the tunnel mouth. Fifty-three t raen
are employed at the Plumbago mine.
At the Gaston Ridge mine sixty-five
men are working. The force at the
Union Blue Gravel mine includes
eighty men.
MIXES ARE TRANSFERRED.
"Transfers of mining property are re
ported by the Tuolumne Independent.
John Daly has sold to J. F. and F. H.
Baker the Sunny Side quartz mine near
the junction of the North Fork and
main Tuolumne River. W. V. Connally
has sold to the Admiral Dewey Min
ing Company a quartz mine, E. E.
Trefethen of Alameda has sold to Hat
tie A. Kendall of Seattle an interesUjn
the New York and Hoffman placer
mines. A. B. Frace of San Francisco
has deeded to John Frace and A. B.
Cruikshank of London, England, all
intercstÂ»In the San Carlos quartz claim.
The Last Chance and two other claims
have been bonded to a San Francisco
party named Holmes.
H. Fleischacker and A. J. Hcchtman
of San Francisco and others have
bought the Black Bear mine on Deer
Creek near the Kentucky Ridge prop
erty In the Rough and Ready district
in Nevada County, so reports the Grass
Valley Union.
The Grass Valley Tidings says that
Oscar Coflin, superintendent of the
Central Consolidated mine, and others
have bonded from William H. Jennings
a group of mining "claims at Banner
Mountain. â  - - . -
Large improvements are to be added
to the extensiv^ plant of the Mountain
Copper Company at Keswlck. Regard
ing this the Redding Searchlight says:
An experienced mining engineer recently ar
rived at Keswlck and 1% now in charge of the
work of remodeling, enlarging and Improving
the great smelting furnaces. The Immediate
work of enlarging the furnaces will bo under
taken. A water jacket a foot and a half i in
depth will be placed upon the top of the fur
naces new in use, thereby Increasing- their
depth by that much. Other improvements will
b*> made about th* furnacÂ«Â«. Kinno thÂ« inÂ«i<-.
uration of the system of smelting, in use at
Keswick enormous savings have been effected
in the system, one of the greatest improve
ments being the installation of hot air cham
bers, which supply the furnaces with a blaat of
air heated to an extraordinary degree. The
hot air apparatus consumes cruda petroleum,
and the blast from it enables the company. to
almost- dispense with the use of coke, an ex
pensive article at Keswlck on account of â  the
cost of transportation from tidewater, thus ef
fecting an encrmr.us saving in the cost of fuel.
KERX COUNTY IS BUSY.
There is a steady growth In the min
ing industry in Kern County, which
is shown by the books of the County
Recorder. Concerning this the â¢Bakers
field Californian says in the course of
a general review:
All indications stem to point to a â¢ettled re
newal of mlninit activity in the Kern County
district. In the various districts new work i a
beinnr rapidly rushed forward. . ThÂ» Zada.
Company, which bought out the Cowboy mines
at Stud Horse Canyon, on Callente Creek, ia
going forward with improvements and. .many
are at work there. A postofflce' has been es
tablished at Amalie. near the Zada - mines.
Several thousand tons of ore, it is stated, was
shipped from the Zada to Selby'g smelter dur
ing the past year. The mine is operated ;by
H. II. Blood and others. Quite a town has
grown up there during the past six months.
There are numerous small mines In that vicin
ity; many of which are undoubtedly good
propositions, but the majority of them "are
owned by poor men and development is â  nat
urally ' slow. â  . .
The Amalie mine, situated about a mile and
a half north of the Zada and across the hill,
la preparing to reopen this spring. -The prop
erty has been in litigation for many years. .
. Krom every section of the county reports
received are very encouraging, not only from
individual miners, but from large operators as
well. Parties from the Woody district say
that ma-ny snnall mines are to be opened. â  The
White River district shows more activity than
has been apparent in years. In the Plute dis
trict a-new three-stamp mill has been erected
during the past summer and Â¥50,000 invested,
it is said by mlnlncr men. The mill 'is now
closed on account of the cold. In the'MoJave
district there has been more development and
more new. plants installed in the past .twelve
months than at any time in the past twelve
years. â¢ On account of the strike at Knntls
burg- manv men left that district, and it has
resulted In a steady stream of practical miners
into other places, looking for opportunities' to
pursue individual operations. The Karma mill
at .Mojave has been finished for some little
time, and tht machinery for a. twenty-stamp
outfit is now on . the ground ready to set up.
Altogether,- the mining situation, in the judg
ment of mining men. Is very satisfactory .in
Kern County, .and gives every indication of a
steady and Vaubstantlal improvement for the
coming year.
riiACER IS TUIiARE.
The only placer mine in Tulare Coun
ty, so says the Visalia Times, will be
opened by John McKiernan of Sprlng
ville on the Wooley & Owen property,
two miles below White River, at the
head of Coarse Gold Gulch. Water will
be raised out of the White River to the
height of 117 feet. In the tract are
forty acres of land that have been pros
pected.
L.. F. Thorn, assistant postmaster at
Pollasky, writes that a rich strike of
gold has been made at Pollasky. Prepa
rations are being made by a number of
parties to work the ground. Dirt from
the well in front of a general merchan
dise store made small returns. There
has been a rich strike also, as stated
by Mr. Thorn, about eight miles from
Pollasky. A mine will soon be in opera
tion on the Ground Squirrel claim. Pol
lasky is on the site of a '49 mining
camp that was formerly ' known as
Hamptonville. At old Fort Millerton
there is a. placer property- A dredger
will be employed to work on the last
mentioned property. , â 
The Mother Lode Banner, considering
the affairs of Tuplumne County in a
large way, says:
Our chief industry â gold mining â has held
its own. and has advanced even under adverse
circumstances. The old plcayunish way of
mining development is Riving way to more
liberal and business methods of mining. The
Santa Ysabel and the Horseshoe Bend, both
mother lode properties, are being opened on
the latest and best linfs of mining science.
ThÂ« days of gophering and Mx-penny mining
seem to be at an end in Tuolumne County.
SLIDE OF SNOW
BURIES MINERS
Avalanche Strikes the Little
Town of Alta and Two .Men
Are Swept Away to Death
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SALT LAKE, Utah, Feb. 12.â In an
avalanche* of snow that struck the little
mining town of Alta this afternoon two
men are known to have met ' death,
while it is feared that others may have
been killed. Alta is thirty miles from
this city/ The dead:
. JOSEPH J. BURNSWOOD, proprietor
of the Granite mine.
JOHN JOHNSON, a watchm.an for
the Albion mine. v
Both were residents of thi&.city and
both leave families. The body* of the
mine owner has been recovered, but
that cf the watchman still lies buried
deep in snow piles.
The slide occurred at 2 o'clock this
afternoon, without the slightest warn
ing. The men were at work 'in the
mines or tending to their accustomed
duties on the surface. Burnswood and
Johnson were chatting at a .table at
the former's residence, and John Per
kins, a clerk, was asleep in a bed up
stairs. Suddenly a great white mass
appeared at the -tÂ°P of the higher wall
of the canyon, and hurled itself down
the mountain side.
. It struck the house with force enough
to reduce the building to" old lumber.
The debris and the three men were car
ried over the hill and on with the ava
lanche. Burnswood and Johnson were
buried In the snow, but Perkins had a
miraculous escape; Awakening to find
himself on the crest of the slide, he
was hurled through space at lightning
speed fo> fully half a mile, then
thrown Into the snow drift uninjured.
To or three small cabins were also
carried away. At a late hour to-night
Burnswood's body had not been found,
although many miners are digging for
It." Several serious snowslldes have oc
curred at Alta,' which was practically
wiped out - by one avalanche- a few
years ago. .

INSTRUCTIVE STUDIES
BY NOTED MEN AND
WOMEN
Hints Upon Dressmaking. 0
BY DOKA MAT MORUEIX.
<Coprrigh:. J9O4. by Joseph B. Howies.)
The question of being well clothed
Is of moment to every woman, and
justly so. since she is judged by what
Fhe wears and since she expresses her
self whether consciously or otherwise
in her raiment- She who can cut, fit
and -make her clothing: is fortunate,
quite as much so as Is she who can
go to a first-class tailor or modiste
and order without further trouble the
gown she reeds at the price she will
pay, but the one is almost as rarely
found as the other. If a girl or woman
has the time to do h**r own sewing
Fhe can invest no money where it will
bring larger and more satisfactory re
turns than in learning the trade of
dressmaking for her own benefit.
There are many little things that one
must learn from a good dressmaker
if she is? to have results that look pro
fessional instead of f home-made.
For the average woman there are
three courses open when it comes to
renewing her wardrobe. She can go
to a shop and buy a dress ready made,
she can buy her goods and take them
for making to the average maker, or
ishe can have a good woman sew for
her at home. To take the goods to
an average dressmaker Is the most ex
pensive of the three and likely to be
more unsatisfactory than either of the
other methods. No dressmaker will
make a costume or gown as well and
cheaply a? it can be bought ready
made at any good house, where the
changes in fitting are made at small
cost
The arguments in favor of having
a dressmaker at home are many. In
the first place, one can sew with her,
doing basting, stitching on the ma
chine and taking lessons in good work
at the rame lime; there is an economy
in the first cost and also through the
opportunity of using linings one has on
hand, bits of Filk. etc.; also, one saves
a great deal in the year by having her
pieces of linings, goods and spools of
thread Wt over in her possession. How
much difTVrpiice this makes one will
realize only after experience shows
her. The drwmaker who comes to
the house is much more ready to use
bits of lace and ribbon than is her
sister who has an establishment to
keep up and must therefore be less
economical of time and goods.
There are two wars in which the
woman who wishes to be well dressed
at small expense will not economize â
5he will not buy inferior lining nor will
she hire any but an expert dressmaker.
Some of those who go out by the day
in cities charge $4 and are worth it in
the style of their work. In two days
Buch a one will cut and fit several
gowns, and her employer or a seam
stress will do the simple work. Almost
as good is a skillful woman who can
fit and who will use any of the excel
lent patterns by which she may get the
design wanted.
Since a dressmaker is paid by the
day, the woman who engages her,' if
she is wise, will have everything In
readiness for her when she arrives,
even to an idea of the way in which the
dress shall be cut. If It is to be made
by pattern that should be at hand.
When the dressmaker Is engaged she
should be consulted as to the amount
of linings and findings, and these
should all be provided at the outset.
It is poor economy to have to go shop
ping while the dressmaker waits. Such
trimmings as could not be bought be
fore operations were begun should be
planned en the day that the dressmaker
comes and be bought at once.
One essential that is too often for
gotten Is a machine In perfect order.
If one is without this useful household
servant she may hire it for a week for
$1 or less. If one is the owner of a
machine she will see that it is well
cleaned and oiled the day before the
dressmaker comes, for by taking It a
day early she does not have to" take
the time for the task when she might
be working with her dressmaker, and
the oil is then past the dripping stage.
Those who use machines know the ir
ritating v.ay drops of oil have of ap
pearing after the machine has been
well Triped and it is supposed to be
free from any such danger.
Prepare for the dressmaker by hav
ing everything ripped that is to be
made over, the threads removed and
the goods sr>onged or cleansed if neces
eary. There is nothing better for
cleansing v.oolcns and silk than water
in which *oap bark is placed. This
will remove the shiny appearance from
black silk. Bits of velvet may be
eteamed over a hot iron and will be
ready to do service again. Laces may
be warned in gasoline if white, but are
not to be starched or ironed. Do not
wash In a room where there is a
tire, as it is unsafe. Each picot should
be ricked out with a pin and the lace
tightly rolled over a bottle or stick.
Black lace that haa lost its firmness
may be dipped into weak gum arable
water, smoothed and hung to dry
where It touches nothing. Passemen
teries that need a stitch to restore their
usefulness tray be put in order easily.
Preparation in these small particulars
is time well spent, and saves dollars.
No lace should ever be thrown away.
for if the ground work has Tvorn out
the figure can be appliquod and b? ef
fective In many places. â¢â¢â¢
Cheap linings are really very expen
sive, for they will not wear as long as
the. material of the gaTvn. and th-y
never <iinc to .the figure to give the
pretty fit desired. â¢ Whether it is well
to use a lining; a second time depends
upon Its quality; as a rule it is unwise
to do this, since if in cleansing it it
has not been kept perfectly true to
the weave it will pull to the side. Oc
casionally a lining is bo firm that it
may safely be used a second time for
a house dress or like inexpensive frock.
A good eambrip is much more to be
choren than a cheap silk, and for all
around service there is nothing' better
than a fine.percaline. Experience has
shown that many of the fancy colored
linings in the cheaper qualities do not
pay to make up. They have been
known to cut in the stitching so that
they never could be worn. It is the
best economy, if one has little money,
to buy only a good thing. Slazy lin
ings are dear at any price.
About Street Railways.
BV SEREXO S. PRATT.
(Editor Wai! Htrwt Journr.l. author of "The
Work of WaJl Street")
(Copyright, JftO4. by Joseph B. Bowles.)
Although the street" railroad'has a
history as long as that of the steam
railroad, its greatest and most rapid
development has been in the last two
decades.
The steam railroad in this country
dates back to 1829. Two years later
the first street railroad was estab
lished. This was in New York City,
and consisted of a crudely constructed
line from Prince street to the Harlem
River. It was not a success, however,
and was abandoned in four years. In
1S32 the lines which now constitute
the main parts of the great Metropol
itan system were constructed, and
street, railways were thereafter soon
introduced into other cities. San
Francisco has the distinction of being
the birthplace, 'In 1S73, of the first
cable railroad, and Cleveland, in 1S81,
of the first electric line.
To the application of electricity as
motive power the street railways owe
their rapid development In the past
twenty years. The "trolley," overhead
and underground, has not only taken
possession of the city streets, but of
the suburban roads and the State
highways. Lines of electric roads now
connect New York and Philadelphia
and New York and Boston. So great
has become their competition in local
traffic with the 6team railroads that
in some instances the latter have re
duced their local service and. leav
ing the suburban traffic - more and
more to the elctric roads, are paying
more attention to the development of
their through business.
But it is a law of the transportation
business that nothing serves more to
increase travel than the increase in
the facilities for travel.
The vice president of the Paris,
Lyons and Mediterranean Railway
recently wrote that every new inven
tion in the way of locomotives serves
only to develop the taste for travel.
As a matter of fact, bicycles, auto
mobiles and trolleys actually increase
travel beyond even the facilities they
themselves afford, so that the steam
railroads are thereby actually bene
fited. In Xew York City it might al
most be said that every new line of
travel has really increased the prob
lem of rapid transit. Statistics show
that the percentage of passengers to
population is increasing at the rate of
three to one. There is no doubt what
ever that the dex-elopment of exten
sive systems of trolley lines is work
ing great changes in the transporta
tion business. The application of
electric motive power to the present
steam lines is a possibility of the fu
ture.
How immense this development has
I been is shown by the statistics for
1302, the latest available for the pur
poses of comparison. The street rail
way mileage was 22,589, or about 11
per cent of the steam railroad mileage.
The capital stock was $1,216,277,989, or
about one-fifth of that of the steam
railroads. The funded debt was $929,
32S.636, or about one-seventh. The gross
earnings were $241,584,697, or 14' per cent
of those of the steam lines. The net
earnings were $102,572,693, or mcrre than
IS per cent. The dividends paid aggre
gated 515.90S.216.
Xot counting the transfers, there
were 4,513.466,001 passengers carried on
the trolleys, the car mileage being
l,097,S06,SS4. That was equal to 63 rides
for every man, woman and child in
the United States. In Xew York City
f in the same year the passengers num
j bered 1,051,000,000, or over 284 rides per
j capita. Some of the lines carry freight.
! express and mail to a limited extent,
but that is a minor part of their busi
ness. The vast investments in street
railroads are made in anticipation of
i..c pro-fit to be derived from the ac
cumulation of 5-cent pieces. The steam
railroads, whose great profits are main
ly derived from freight, carried in the
year under review only one-seventh as
many passengers as the street rall
1 roads, although their mileage is so
(much greater. . *:
It is not surprising that powerful
capitalists have been attracted by the
boundless possibilities in the accumu
lation of 3-cent pieces to invest heav
ily in the street railroad business.
Commodore VanderbHt constructed the
Hue through Fourth avenue. New York.
Jay Gould early recognized the oppor
tunities which this field of enterprise
afforded and obtained control of the
elevated railroads in that city. His
children still maintain the investment.
i although the control the property
j has passed by lease to the company
I which is constructing and is to ope
j rate the underground railroad through
| Manhattan Island, in which August
I Belmont and other noted capitalists are
interested. The surface lines in New
! York have been developed into a great
system by William C. Whitney and
Thomas F. Ryan, with tfi e aid of the
! Wideners and Elkinses of Philadelphia,
j who. besides their control of traction
I lines in that city, have been connected
i with similar enterprises in Chicago and
j Pittsburg. J. Pierpont Morgan, E. K.

AN EQUABLE CLIMATE.
IT is a common thing to hear Eastern people com
plain that the coast climate of California is cold, at
certain seasons of the year. As we have pointed out,
the diurnal fluctuations of our coast temperature seldom
exceed ten degrees.. Take the record for the nth of
this month, as an example. The minimum temperature
in San Francisco was 46, ahd the maximum 54.. East of
the mountains the temperature was, at Flagstaff, Arizona,
18 and 54; at Carson, Nev., 16 and 52; at Phoenix, 34 and
74; at Winnemucca, 12 and 48. This difference between
the lowest and highest daily temperature increases as
the record extends eastward.- It is known that the daily
change in temperature, more than the seasonal change,
affects health, the prosecution of industries and the pro
ductivity of a country.
The record establishes the reliability of climatic condi
tions in California. The equability of temperature is a
permanent and not a sporadic condition. In that re
spect this State differs radically from any other part of
the United States. Its conditions of temperature are fixed.
The cool weather in the winter months is not the cold
weather of tin Eastern winter. The average lowest tem
perature at all coast and valley points in California on
February 11 was 42 5-8, and the average highest was 57.5
an average total fluctuation of only 15 degrees. At the
points recorded east of the Sierra Nevada, the same day,
the average lowest temperature was 20, and the average
highest 57, a difference of 3" degrees.
As far as California temperatures arc concerned, it may
be. estimated with certainty that the averages will be
practically the same next year and forever. In all of our
endeavors to attract the attention of the East to our
climate, this quality of reliable equability should be made
plain. In the East the characteristic winter epidemics
have their origin in the acute daily changes in tempera
ture. It is a common thing there to have a change of
40 degrees in twenty-four hours, and a fall of 30 degrees
in thirty minutes is not uncommon.
A very acute illustration of inequability and unrelia
bility of climate was furnished recently by a Denver
newspaper, which made comparisons between Denver
and Chicago on the temperatures of February. 4, by
pointing out that the highest temperature in Denver on
that date was 68, being s^ill below the warm record of
that date, which is 77 degrees, reached in 1890. But the
same paper quite innocently added: "The coldest
weather in Denver on February 4 was in 1883, when the
temperature was 22 below zero.'.'
This admission means a record of a difference in tem
perature on the same day of the month in different years
of 99 degrees! A visitor lured to such place 'may there
fore find, the temperature 99 degrees lower or higher, at
haphazard. The same excessive change may be found at
any other point, clear'* to the Atlantic coast. During the
present winter changes of 62 degrees in twenty-four
hours have not been uncommon in that region.
We by no means underrate the capacities and produc
tive and industrial power of the East, but desire merely
to emphasize the agreeable differences between the
equable climate of California and the Eastern climate.
The alarming epidemics of pneumonia this winter in
Eastern cities are caused by the extreme fluctuations of
temperature. In Chicago. New York. Washington and
other cities, that disease has taxed the resources of physi
cians and health boards and the capacity of hospitals.
The percentage of fatalities has been unusually large, and
as consumption develops in a definite proportion of pa
tients after the acute disease is spent, we get a view of
the reason for the constant increase in that most fatal
of all respiratory diseases. The way for it is prepared
by pneumonia, and that originates largely in the daily
fluctuations of temperature.
Acute diseases of the respiratory organs exist every
where. They are found in California, but they are' not
epidemic here. Consumption is in many parts of the
State an imported disease, and gets its hold apparently
by infection. It is one of the disadvantages of an equable
climate that it attracts the sick, who somewhat spread dis
ease by contact and infection. This is being overcome
everywhere by the spread of medical knowledge and the
extending use of disinfection.
But here again, we have the advantage of. an equable
climate as a safeguard against imported disease. In Cal
ifornia the enjoyment of outdoor life is in reach all the
year, and infectious diseases are spread by life indoors,
compelled by the rigors and changes of temperature.
An edict has gone forth that subordinates in Federal
employment in this city must render to the Government
service of equal efficiency and time to that demanded by
private employers. In our intense interest in the war
like affairs of the Far East we should not forget that
this order from Washington marks a bloodless revolu
tion in the affairs of Uncle Sam.
RURAL MAIL DELIVERY."
THE rural free delivery system of the postofiice,
efficient though it has proved to be, is still the
subject of legislative consideration and of pro
jected measures for the betterment of its service. By
the recent ruling 01 the Fourth Assistant Postmaster
General relative to the handling of newspapers by the
rural carriers a hardship has been worked upon both the
proprietors of the journals and the carriers themselves
which calls for some legislation on the part of Congress
to determine the real intent of the law governing the
duties, of the country tpostman. A bill will be intro
duced in Congress shortly granting such employes of the
department enlarged powers in the matter of the dis
tribution of newspapers along their routes of delivery. V
According to the late ruling of the department car
riers are restricted in the enjoyment of any addition to
their meager salaries which might come from their rfct
ing in the capacity of news agents by the fiat that all
unaddressed papers coming to them direct from the pub
lishers by mail or any vehicle outside of the mails must
be subject to the regular payment / of postage for second
class matter before they can be delivered. If the car
rier be a registered news agent he is allowed the priv
ileges of publishers and, newsdealers and instead of pay
ing one cent for every four ounces of unaddressed papers
which come "to him for /distribution he is charged one
cent a. pound. In other words, the department rules that
bundles of unaddressed papers coming to the carrier-are
"out of the mails" at the minute they are delivered to
him and that to, forward them to their destination' he
must mail them to himself and then deliver them. :
Under this regime the Government gains nothing.
Even if the carrier be a registered news agent the reve
nue from the bundle of unaddressed papers is. the same
as if the publishers had -separately," scaled, and addressed
every copy to their country subscribers; ,Not only would
there be a considerable saving of labor in sorting the
mail if the rural carrier were allowed to act as. the direct
deliverer, but the gain in time and expense to the pub
lishers would be very appreciable. Were the present
order remedied subscriber, carrier and publisher would
all profit.
It behooves Congress to make the rural service more
profitable to the carrier. The maximum salary of $600
now received by them cannot be said to be in itself suf
ficient, nor does the prospect of working indefinitely for
that wage with no increase as the reward of meritorious
service appear golden. During the fiscal year ending
July 31, 1902.- 18 per .cent of the entire force of rural
free delivery carriers resigned, and even after the re
muneration had been increased the ratio of resignations
was 19 per cent. Could Congress see fit to offer the coun
try postmen increased salary upon the civil service idea
of merit the sj'stem would doubtle'ss profit thereby. -At
any rate the carrier should not be entirely debarred from
picking up an honest penny to supplement his present
The splendid building which San Francisco will erect
at the St. Louis Exposition to represent our progress
in the civilizing arts is to be adorned with a roof gar
den, in which dishes reminiscent of the San Franciscans'
native heath arc to be prepared and served. What sort
of cooking will they have? This city isgastroriomically
cosmopolitan, and if all our people are reminded of our
home cooking the rest of the fair will flee in dismay.
TEACHERS' RETIREMENT FUND.
Â£ COMMITTEE representing the Teachers' Re
/\ direment and Annuity Association has requested
.* *â¢â  the Board of Education to obtain the opinion of
the City and County Attorney as to the power of the
board to deduct one dollar a month or more from the
salary of each teacher, with or without her consent, for
the benefit of the fund. As the statute is mandatory as
regards this city, and perfectly plain, this means a re
quest for an opinion as to the constitutionality of the
law. As this question is morally certain to be some
time tested in the courts iÂ£ is none too early to begin its
careful examination.
The legal" aspect of the case, however, is not the only
phase needing attention. It is imperative, before pro
ceeding much further in the matter, to obtain a report
of competent insurance actuaries as to what annuities
any given contribution can be relied on to produce. A
life annuity of $50 per month, if purchased from an in
surance company, at .the age of fifty years would cost
a lump sum of $5692 40 if made payable quarterly. A
teacher contributing $i per month pays into the fund
but $360 in thirty years. If the contribution were $3 per
month, it would amount to $1080 in that period. The
money paid into an insurance company would be in
vested and earn income. But a small part of the pay
ments of our teachers is to be invested. There is a dis
crepancy here which needs explanation. The % city can
not afford to be a part3* to a deception.
It is certain that a great number of the teachers are
dissatisfied with the working of the law. It is asserted
by some* that this is the feeling'of the majority. That
is a question of fact easily determined. The cost of a
secret ballot would be very trifling and the Board of
Education would do Well to take one. The- opposition
even of a considerable majority, however, should not
necessarily defeat the plan, provided it is financially
sound, nor is there much reason to believe that any
serious opposition would exist to the establishment of an
annuity system on a basis recognized as equitable, finan
cially sound and within the means of the contributors.
A claim on a reliable annuity fund is a very valuable
asset, but it costs money. There is no way by which
provision for old age can be made without serious cost,
involving for most people great present sacrifice. But it
is worth having. Provision for superannuated workers
is a question which inevitably arises whenever tenure of
service in public employment is made permanent. It has
been settled in all other countries by a pension system.
American public sentiment has never favored that.
The question is a burning one in the Federal civil
service. It has become so in our school department.
It will .arise in all branches of our city government In
the course of time. The great employing corporations
are already dealing with it. The Federal civil service
employes have taken expert advice and find the cost of
retirement annuities prohibitory at Mieir present salaries.
The Federal Civil Service Commission has recommended
the creation of a fund, one half by deduction from stla
ries, and one half by contributions from the Treasury.
Thus far our city authorities seem to have been pro
ceeding blindly. There are many young teachers who do
not believe they will themselves ever get benefit from
their contributions. The annuitants are in fear lest those
who are dissatisfied may bring suit. It is a question
which should be faced openly, frankly and in a kindly and
liberal spirit. But it should be dealt with thoroughly and
on expert advice."
Seventeen of a native constabulary in Luzon deserted
their posts the other day, robbed the people they were
employed to guard, equipped themselves with rifles and

somewhat clearly that they do not like the climate of
their native land. They arc rapidly placing themselves in

TALK OF THE TOWN
AND TOPICS OF THE
TIMES
Something in a Name.
Horace Hawes, a well-known lawyer
in his day and the author of the con
solidation act. which was the funda
mental law of San Francisco for over
thirty years, was famous for his biting
sarcasm when aroused to use it. An
occasion came one time when he was
engaged in a controversy over a case
in court where the late E. D. Sawyer,
at one time a District Judge, was the
opposing counsel in the case.
Judge Sawyer interrupted Hawes'
argument with, "Oh. pshaw! There is
I nothing in a name." This sneer was
interjected at a time when Horace
Hawes was quoting from some cele
brated author on the law of evidence,
of which he wished the court to take
â  judicial notice.
! "What's that?" ejaculated Hawes.
"Nothing in a name; no such thing,
sir; there is everything in a name. We
have an example of the value of a
name right here in this city. We have
one eminent lawyer on the bench here
named Lorenzo Sawyer, whose deci
sions are quoted and respected all over
the United States for their soundness,
1 and out of respect to this name the
people of this city have elevated four
Sawyers to the bench and made no
taries public of three more; none of
whom know sufficient law to get a
mangy dog out of the public pound."
Judge Laivson's Luck.
A few days ago Justice of the Peace
Lawson attracted considerable atten
tion to himself at the City Hall by
walking about the corridors with a
most dismal expression on his face.
"What's the trouble. Judge?" asked
a newspaper man. who, being well ac
quainted with Lawson, noticed the un
happy look on his face.
"Oh, nothing," said Lawson, "just a
case of hard luck. A young fellow and
a girl just came into my chambers
with a license and asked me to make
them husband and wife. When I had
tied the knot the groom asked me
what was the fee. He was well dressed
and appeared prosperous. I told him
that I left that matter to him. He
handed me half a dollar. Of course.
I refused it, and told him to take his
little wifey out and buy her a swell
dinner with it. He thanked me very
kindly and left. I went over to my
desk and sat down to enter the fact
that I had this day performed the
ceremony uniting two fond and loving
hearts and also to ruminate on the
question of the extravagance of young
people. Hardly had I completed the
entry when I detected the odor of
burning cloth. I got up hastily and
discovered that a hole as big as a
dollar had been burned in a brand new
pair of $14 trousers I had put on for
the first time that morning. I had sat
on a butt of a cigar left behind by the
liberal gentleman whom I had just
made a benedict."
The Pen and the Punch.
A thickset. long-armed, bull-necked
fighter
Lived next door to a struggling writer.
Who was hollow-eyed and thin and pale.
While the pug waxed stout on beef and
ale.
The man of brains spent years of niphta
With Learning's glorious ancient lights;
And the pus said. "Bet you, de bloke

While he's starving, wishes he had my

Dcse fellows wld brains ought to take a
hunch
And drill demselves wid de knock-out

The bruiser slaughtered a fool his size
And was given a thousand-dollar prize.
And the neighbors said, "There's more in
fighting.
It's very plain, than there is in writing:"
The pug won a pile ere he lost his grip;
Then played the races, and each "straight
tip %!
Diminished his wealth, till he launched
full soon â
And ruined himself â in a beer saloon.
The writer finished a book and a play
And a song the world would sing some
day.
And his royalties, flowing in at last.
Made his coffers gleam with a fortune
vast.
A Home for the Aged and Helpless then
He built with the fruits of his brain and

The fighter, friendless, helpless and old.
Wrecked in body and hungry and cold.
Unknown, crawled into the home one
day
And passed his waning hours away.
But before he was counted out. he said.
"Brains and a pen are worlds ahead!
If I had kids. I'd give dem de hunch

Matches.
Few people realize that matches may
be considered one of the leading inven
tions of the nineteenth century, yet ex
actly 100 years ago the chemical facili
ties for obtaining fire, as a substitute
for the clumsy and untrustworthy tin
der box, which then formed the only
means of "striking a light," began to
be studied. Matches which ignite by
friction are now held so ridiculously
ch.eap that It is almost impossible to
realize that once they were a costly as
well as a dangerous luxury, while when
first introduced the very names of
phosphorus and lucifer had something
diabolical in them to the conservative
mind. The tinder box constitutes one
of the very earliest methods of obtain
ing fire, and it Is believed to have been
used in the households of our Saxon
ancestors, although the earliest men
tion of them is by Shakespeare.
Sensible Justice.
Squire John V. Ginley of Cleveland.
Ohio, is a believer in ths sacredness
of the marriage bond. He has theories
of his own regarding the. duties of the
justice. Runaway couples and ro
mantically inclined young people v.lio
imagine that the love which is claimed
to come at first sight is always tasting
affection do not receive much sym
pathy from him. Although he has had
the title of '"justice of the peace" sine*
last September he has not one mar
riage ceremony to tell of. Bashful
pairs have entered his office and- have
made known their wishes, but after
the squire/ has spoken a few words and
produced a certatn document which he
requested them to sign. In each case
there has been hemming and hawing
and a faintly murmured. "I guess we
don't want to get married yet," and
then a rather hasty exit.
"Do you know the meaning of the
words 'until death do ye part'?" That
Is the question the squire puts to those
who come to him to be made man and
wife, and when they feebly murmur,
"Ye3." he produces a paper which
would make those who sign it parties
to an agreement not to take any ad
vantage of any law whereby they might
in the future obtain a divorce. At this
juncture It has been the saulre'a ex
perience that a general waning of en
thusiasm ensues, and his callers leave
him. Squire Glnley does not believe
in divorce. It is a matter of principle
with him first and then of law.â Boston
Transcript.
In the Kaiser's Smile.
Those who are interested in German
affairs would do well to keep their eyes
on Baron Hans Christian von Ham
merstein. Minister of the Interior of
Prussia, and who at the present mo
ment enjoys probably to a greater de
gree than any of his colleagues the
favor and the good will of the Kaiser.
The latter has just conferred upon him
the right to wear the imperial hunt
uniform, a distinction enjoyed by none
of the other Ministers of stateâ not even
by the Chancellor of the empire â and
has announced his Intention of confer
ring upon him the order of St. Hubert,
a rare distincticn, which, aside from
the princes of the blood and the very
great nobles, is only worn by Field
Marshal Count Waldersee.
Baron Hammerstein is about 60 years
old. and. like so many other men high
in office in the service of Prussia, a
Hanoverian by birth, his father having
been in turn Minister of State of the
last King of Hanover and subsequent
ly of the present reigning Grand Duke
of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Baron Hans
took part in the Franco-German war,
and subsequently was employed in the
civil administration of the conquered
provinces of Alpace and Lorraine, where
by means of his tact, breadth of view
and sound judgment he contributed in
no small measure to reconcile the peo
ple to their new rulers and to their
altered allegiance. In fact, while there
is no prospect of Count Bulow's resign
ing the Chancellorship, since apparent
ly he continues to enjoy as much as
ever the well deserved confidence of his
sovereign, yet Baron Hammerstein's
name is being freely discussed at Ber
lin as the most likely candidate for his
succession.

Charges Against Land Ring

Because of a recent decision by Judge
Grossdnp of Illinois and by Judge Han
ford of Oregon the Federal Grand Jury
In this city yesterday refused to find
an indictment against A. R. Van Ar
mand. C. F. Gardiner, Silas Penry and
"John Doe" Bullock, whose Christian
r.ame is unknown to the prosecution.
The accused were charged before the
Grand Jury with having induced sev
eral persons to file homesteads on Gov
ernment land fraudulently in Tuolunvie
and Calaveras counties in June, 1902.
Witnesses testified before the Grand
Jury that Van Armand had represented
that he wanted to get men to take up
homesteads along the line of the Sierra
Railroad so that they might work for
the company and settle the country
It was shown also that Van Armand
had gone to Sacramento City and in
duced sixteen or seventeen persons to
Tile homestead claims in the Land Of
fice there, and that they took what is
known as "the non-mineral affidavit"
to the effect that they had personally
visited and gone over the land for
which they had filed claims. It was
shown that the applicants had not vis
ited the land and that the affidavits
therefore did not recite the truth.
Judges Grosscup and Hanford, in
similar cases, decided recently that the
non-mineral affidavit is not an affidavit
required by law, and therefore when
ft recites a falsehood it is not consid
ered perjury. This affidavit is only a

LOCKETS PROVE
HIS UNDOING
George T. McDonnell Is Found
Guilty of Using the Mails
lo Further Cunning Scheme
SEEKING FOR A LOOPHOLE
Ingenious Defense That the
Accused Was Engaged in a
Perfectly Legitimate Trade
Notwithstanding that United States
District Judge de Haven made a very
favorable charge, the jury returned a
verdict of guilty yesterday against
George T. McDonnell, who had been
indicted for using the mails for the
purpose of furthering a scheme to de
fraud. Bert Schlesinger, counsel for
the prisoner, will move to have the
verdict set aside on the ground that
McDonnell gave full value for the
money.
It was shown that McDonnell repre
sented himself to be Rev. J. B. Tay
lor, pastor of the Church of the Re
deemed, at the Emeryville racetrack
and as H. Epstein, pawnbroker at 331
Kearny street in this city, and offered
to sell very valuable gold lockets set
with diamonds for $12 50 each. Two of
the decoy letters that were read in
court were as follows:
EMERYVILLE, Cal.. July 20, 1903.
Mr. William Stark. Gardnerville, New â Dear
Sir: The inclosed pawn ticket in Bent to you
by way of restitution. The sender is at the
point of death as the result of an accident.
He wishes me to say that he once stole some
moneyâ from you which he is unable to re
fund, but that the difference between the
value of the locket and the amount it is
pledged for Is considerably more than the
sum stolen. He hopes that you will be able
in this way to reimburse yourself. Tours
very truly. J. B. TAYLOR.
Pastor Church of the Redeemed.
H. Epstein. Mortgages and Loans. 331 Kearny
ftreet. San Francisco. Cal., Aug. 18, 1903.
Mr. Clay A. StraJey, " Cottonwood, Shasta
County, Cal. â Dear Sir: Your favor of the
16th is here. 1 have never heard of the min
ister you inquire about, nor of his church.
The locket, was left with me July 6. I never
give O*e names of borrowers except upon the
order of a court. To do so would be a breach
of confidence, besides I have no acquaintance
with him.
If doubts concerning its possession make
you hesitate to send for the locket you may
dismiss them. I hold myself responsible.
Personally I would prefer to keep it, but
the matter is too trifling for much corre
spondence.
These letters were sent through the
mails by McDonnell, and complaint be
ing made to the postal authorities Post
office Inspector James O'Connell was
detailed on the case.
Mr. Schlesinger proved by two jew
elers that the lockets offered by Mc-
Donnell were worth the $12 50 each that
had been asked for them. The wit
nesses .testified that the lockets were
worth from ten to sixteen dollars each
and that 33 per cent over -and above
the wholesale price was a fair profit
on jewelry. To back up the testimony,
the counsel cited a recent decision by
Judge Grosscup of Illinois In the case
of the United States against O'Xeill.
who had been charged with a similar
offense. O'Xeill used diamond rings as
his bait and represented through the
malls that they had been pawned with
him by a lady in distress. It was
shown that O'Xeill had asked only a
fair price for the rings, and Judge
Grosscup instructed the jury to acquit
if they believed such to be the fact,
notwithstanding the misrepresentations
that had been made by the accused.
Judge de Haven instructed the jury
that they should acquit the defendant
unless they believed that the lockets
wore "of far less value" than the
amount asked for them. The jury was
out only half an hour.
SAYS FRAUD CAXXOT BE
PRACTICED OX 3IACHIXE
Frank C. Jordan Points lo Fact That
Law Prevents Illesal Use of
Voting: Contrivance.
The matter of using votinsr ma
chines in coming elections in Califor
nia is attracting a great deal of at
tention and the article in The Call of
yesterday that Walter Parker had
found a defect in the machine exhib
ited at Los Angeles this week haa been
discussed generally.
Frank C. Jordan, general agent of
the United States Standard, says the
machines are right, and yet it is true
that at the meeting of the Board of
Supervisors, public officials and others
held Tuesday last in Los Angeles
Walter F. Parker raised a new point
which perplexed him for a minute.
By a system of locks and releases
the machine enables the voter to cost
a ballot for any certain number of
men nominated for such offices as Su
perior Jud^e. Constable, etc.
As the law requires, opportunity is
also given to vote for independent
candidates for these same positions by
writing the name in an independent
column of the machine charged with
a roll of paper.
Parker advanced the idea that the
voter could vote for one candidate for
Superior Judge in the regular way
and then vote for the same man again
as an independent candidate*
Jordan cites sections of laws relat
ing to elections, which apparently set
tle the points and objections raised.
Evidently from the provisions of the
statutes cited by him the name of a
candidate could not be voted in the
independent column if it appeared on
any of the keys of the machine, thus

Can Recover Nothing;.
' ' E. P. Justice of the Bolsa drainage
district cannot recover any portion of
the amount he paid for taxes under
protest to the Tax Collector of Orange

decision rendered yesterday. The pay

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY. FEBRUARY 13, 1904.
SHERLOCK HOLMES WANTED
IN JUDGE MOGAN'S COURT
Testimony Against Charles Hauser Is Tangled
So Badly That Court Is in Doubtâ Machine
Man Vindicates Himselfâ Delaney Dismissed
Judge Mogan issued a subpena yes
terday for Sherlock Holmes to aid him
in elucidating the case of Charles
Hauser. The defendant is accused of
burglarizing the saloon premises of
Frank McCabe at 546 First street and
despoiling him of a black valise and
sundry bottles of whisky.
There are many tangled skeins in the
threads of testimony against the de
fendant. Two boys saw Hauser com
ing from the direction of McCabe's
dispensary, carrying a red valise. The
depleted and complaining witness tes
tified that he never had owned a red
valise and that the missing grip was
block in color. â¢; ' .
Two policemen claim to have seen
Hauser seek the shelter of a neighbor
ing lumber yard and subsequently
emerge and travel in the direction of
.McCabe's booze repository*. When they
found that a burglary had been com
mitted they arrested him for percent
age.
Stronger than all this testimony came
the accusing tongue of Mrs. Kate Mag
nus. She told the Judge that while she
was attending a wake on the night suc
ceeding the burglary a messenger light
ly brought her word that her brother,
"King" Shea, had been arrested. When
she communicated this information to
Hauser. who was one of the mourners,
he said that if it was about that whis
ky affair the "King" would have to
stand for it.
"What was your brother arrested for
on this night?" asked the Judge.
'â¢Why, you know what he is generally
arrested for," said Mrs. Magnus.
"I assure you, madam," said the
Judge, "that I really can't remember
"King 1 Shea."
"Well, he was arrested for having a
bosom full of booze, and that is the
charge against him generally," said his
sister. .
In the maze of conflicting testimony
the Judge continued the case until
February 15 for further hearing.
Theodore Ellenbeck, the ghost of Odd
Fellows' Cemetery, who lives in a hovel
out that way and scared women by
peering through their windows, was
sentenced to thirty days in the County
Jail yesterday. There he can peer and
peer and not disturb the peace of any
one.
James Allen was lying idly on a sofa,
smoking a Turkish cigarette Thursday
night at 836% Sacramento street, when
Sergeant Christiansen called upbn him.
On a nearby table were a layout and
dice intended for a hazard game, but
there were no players. The door was
opened for the officer by a Jap named
O. K. Rite. In confidence Allen told the
Police Judge .that the Jap's name was
O. K. Wrong and that he should not
have "admitted the sergeant. As there
was no evidence that gambling was in
progress the Judge was compelled to
dismiss the case.
O. Sakurai, the man of the many ma
chines, will not need to draw upon the

TWKNTY-SEVTCXTH INFANTRY
RETURNS FROM PHILIPPINES
After Few Days' Rest at the Presidio
They Will Go to Eastern
Points.
The Twenty-seventh Infantry, which
arrived from Manila on the transport
Logan yesterday, will be landed at 9:30
o'clock this morning. It will go Into
temporary encampment in the Sibley
tents at the Lombard-street entrance
to the post. The troops came home in
fine condition and in excellent health.
Major Devol went alongside with the
Slocum and brought Colonel Samuel
R. Whitall, commander of the Twenty
seventh Infantry; Brigadier General
T. J. Wint and Brigadier General Jesse
M. Lee ashore. Colonel Whitall at
once called on General MacArthur and
General WInt'and General Lee went to
the Occidental Hotel, where they will
remain for a few days.
Surgeon Frank A. Tetamore, who
was recently drowned in the Philip
pines, was well known at Jhe Presidio.
He was a capable surgeon and made
many friends at the post.
Surgeon Benjamin J. Edger will
leave in about ten days for the Gov
ernment Insane Hospital at Elizabeth
in charge of a number of insane sol
diers. During his absence j his post
will probably be filled by Surgeon John
Howard Allen.
Major Charles R. Tyler, who arrived
from Manila yesterday, was at once
removed from the transport and taken
to the general hospital, as he was suf
fering from an attack of malarial
fever. i
Colonel Alfred C. Girard, assistant
surgeon general, U. S. A., was among
the passengers on the Logan. It is
expected that Colonel Girard will suc
ceed Lieutenant Colonel George H.
Torney as chief surgeon of the De
partment of California.
Among those who registered at
headquarters yesterday were â¢ Captain
Dwight W. Ryther, Sixth Infantry;
Captain Bradner D. Slaughter, pay de
partment, and Captain James M.
Moore, Twenty-seventh Infantry.
The Twenty-eighth Infantry was
paid off yesterday and later they all
donned their new uniforms in place of
the khaki uniforms they had been
shivering in.
The Tenth Infantry will be paid off
to-day, bo there will be plenty of
money jingling in the soldiers 1 pockets

wood for neglect, Charles E. Fellows
against Mollie - Fellows for desertion
and Grace M. Gerrard against George
1*. Gerrard for cruelty.
He was vindicated in Police Court' yes
terday by Tax Collector Smith, who
testified that under a phonograph
"parlor" license all characters of ma
chines could be sustained.
Benjamin Delaney, a saloon-keeper
at Fourth and Mission streets, was dis
missed in Police Court yesterday on
a charge of battery. The complaining
witness was J. Musto, a machinist, and
for exhibit "A" he showed an orb that
was colored like a storm at sea.
The testimony showed that Musto
bought four bottles of beer. from an
other saloon and insisted that Delaney
should redeem the bottles at an ex
pense of 20 cents. When Delaney de
clined to take up another's burden,
Musto became belligerent. What hap
pened thereafter must be classed
among the doubtful starters. -There
'was a conflict between the two men and
their testimony in conflicting. Delaney
claimed that while trying to prevent
Musto from doing him harm he inad
vertently pushed Musto against a bar
rel. Musto claimed that the saloon
keeper landed a pivot blow on him. As
this could not be corroborated the de
fendant was allowed to go at large. -
James Mackenzie, an insistent and
aggressive beggar, who is only one
shade better than' a hold-up man, was
sentenced to six months in the County
Jail yesterday. The practice of begging
alms around dark corners and when
they are refused of threatening a man
with personal injury is one of the prac
tices that might better be stopped in
San Francisco, even though it might
cost a few worthless lives. Begging is
not a grave crime, but a beggar made
bold will soon become a highwayman.
F. W. Gilbert is a musical barber who
sings in minors. He has lost a wife
and he found her abiding place at the
home of his father-in-law, J. W. Star
redat, who maintains a residence at
630 O'Farrell street. For many months
he had made a practice of coming into
the front yard and crying in wolfish
tones to attract his wife's attention.
He was sentenced to three months in
the County Jail yesterday, merely to
quell the howls he made on & public
street.

William Scott, the American who
badly battered the Russian who made
reflections on the United States, was
discharged by Judge Conlan yesterday.
The complaining witness was named
Whitshi and during the argument he
said something about the United States
that could not be borne by any self-re
specting citizen.
Scott turned out to be a hay and
grain dealer of Sacramento with an un
impeachable record, and when he land
ed on the Russian it was purely in the
spirit of patriotism. On this showing
he was allowed to go, partly because
Judge Conlan, Clerk Rice and Bailiffs
Walsh and Laws are native born of
Sacramento, but mostly" because Scott
was defending the honor of his country.
CONTRABAND OF WAR

Ever since the outbreak of hostili
ties betwen Japan and Russia Cus"
toms Collector Stratton has been be
sieged with letters from merchants of
this city with reference to the clear
ance of vessels carrying contraband of
war for Oriental ports. The Collector
said yesterday that he would continue
to clear vesels with such cargo, but
that the shipments would be at the
risk of the shippers.
It is understood that "large orders
have been received in the United
States from both Russia ana Japan for
foodstuffs and clothing designed for
the use of their respective armies. On
the steamship Korea, which sailed
from this port on February 2, were
400,000 pounds of canned meats and
vegetables, mostly from Chicago and
San Francisco, consigned to Vladivos
tok, by way. of Nagasaki. Should the
Japanese Government find that these
supplies are intended to be "used "by
the Russian army the goods may be
seized as contraband when the steamer

claim that she is entitled to one-half
of the Clunie estate on the ground
that it is community property and as
serts that she is 'bound by agreement
signed by her before Clunie's death.
The agreement mentioned ,is the

In the Clunie estate now pending be
fore Judge Coffey. It was made in
1901 at a time wjien the relations be
tween Clunie and his wife were
strained. JU that time, according to
the answer of the exe6utors, Clunie
made a deed investing in himself and
his wife title to the property in Sac
ramento known as the Turclu Hotel,
with the understanding that the title,
upon the death of one or the other
was to vest in the survivor. Clunie
also agreed to make her an allowance
of Â«J200 a month out of his share of
the profits from this property. In re
turn for the 6onveyance, the executors
allege, Mrs. Clunie waived her rights
to the rest of the estate of her hus
band.
The executors also allege in support
of their claim that Mrs. Clunie is not
entitled to half of the million-dollar
estate of her husband: that in June,
1903, she requested of her husband
that he bequeath to her in his will all
interest in property (outside of the
.Turclu building) on J and K streets,
Sacramento, and the family residence
on Fell and Lyon streets, this citj4
This was done, the executors say, and
therefore acts as an estoppal of Mrs.
Clunie's claim of half the estate. â¢

Stanford. Washington and Cali
fornia Are to Be Represented
bv Various Barge Crews
BERKELEY. Feb. 12.â It is settled
that there will be intercollegiate boat
races this year on the Pacific Coast.
After years of trying on the part of the
locating men of the University of Cali
fornia a sentiment for boating has been
aroused at Stanford University, and to
make the matter more interesting, the
University of Washington has promised
to come into the fold.
The negotiations were completed on
Wednesday, when the directors of the
L'oatir.g Association of the University
cf California, acting on the word of
the rowing men of the other two uni
versities, set April 23 as the day for
holding a regatta on Sessions Basin,
one of the best stretches of water on
the coast. There will be two intercol
legiate races and several club races.
The first race will be between the
freshmen of California and Stanford.
The men v.ill race in four-oared barges
over a distance of a mile and a half.
Ed Grlndley will go to Stanford to
arrange the details for this race. The
crews have not yet been picked.
The second race will bring the best
crews of California and Washington
together. They will race in four-oared
Larpes, also, over the same course.
Neither crew has yet been picked.
A number of races will be rowed be
tween representative clubs. An effort
is being: made to secure the Portland
Rowing Club to row against the Val
lejo Rowing Club, the race to be rowed
in four-oared shells. Peter Kaarsberg,
California's crack athlete, is captain of
the Vallejo team. Besides this race, if
the negotiations go through, will be a
number of single scull races between
well-known amateurs.
RAIN" PREVKXTS TRAINING.
Stanford Ball Players and Athletes
Arc Kept Off the Field.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Feb. 12.
â Rain and uncertain weather condi
tions during the week have interfered
considerably with work both on the
diamond and on the track. When not
raining it has been too cold for hard
work. The baseball men have been
compelled to be extremely careful in
throwing in order to prevent lame
arms.
Coach Doyle is shifting the infield
players continually in an effort to as
certain the best possible combination.
Trowbridge, who up to this week has
been playing third base, has been
moved to shortstop, and "Bob" Wil
liams has been shifted from shortstop
to second. It is hoped this change will
bring improvement in the working of
the team. Trowbridge has a stronger
arm than Williams, and in that re
spect is a more desirable man for that
p< sition and the long throws that the
shortstop usually has to make.
Three froshmen â Chalmers. Swain
and Keliyâ are being tried at third base
and all are showing up fairly well.
Colbert, one of the strongest candi
dates for first base, has quit the uni
versity and left for his home in the
East. This will leave in the contest
for that position Blake, '04, who has
played the position on the varsity be
fore, and also Moore, '05, and Knight,
v ho has played in the field.
Of the fielders the most promising
candidates are Wint, '06, who played
right field on the varsity last season;
Knight, '04, who has also played the
Fame position, and Morrow and Stott
cf the freshman class.
For the first time in the history of
baseball at Stanford strict training
ru!es will be enforced among the play
ers. Coach Doyle hopes in this way
to overcome the listlessness displayed
in the game with the St. Mary's Col
]fge nine.
To-morrow the varsity nine w'H m ;et
th<Â» Santa Clara team in the seco-nd
pame of the series with the college
team. Stanford won the first of th-2
series which was played at Santa Clan
by the score of 11 to 10.

CUP WINNERS IN

Cleverest Women Players Are

HANDICAPS INCREASED
Poorer Players Arc Given an
Opportunity to Have Their
Names Engraved on Prize
If weather conditions permit, two
tennis tournaments will be played on
the courts this week. Both will be
held at Golden Gate Park. The
women's handicap singles for the
Jackman cup, postponed from last
Saturday, will be played to-day. The
men of the first and fourth clases of
the Golden Gate Club will meet to
morrow.
Much interest Is centered in to-day's
event, owing to the fact that all three
of the cup winners are entered and
some lively games are expected. These
three players â Miss Edwards, Miss
Hotchkiss and Miss Ethel Ratcliffe â
have always been "15" back of scratch,
but wil play from "15 3-6" behind it
to-day. No player receiving a handi
cap has her name on the cup and for
this reason the handicaps have been
increased. If the cup again goes to
one of the scratch players she will
undoubtedly have earned it. Miss Bes
sie Valleau and Miss Maud Varney,
getting "15" every game, certainly
look to have an excellent chance of
winning. Miss Wegener and Miss Wat
son are also on this mark, and, al
though they are somewhat out of prac
tice, have a good chance. All other
entries will receive "30."
Rivalry between the Misses Hotch
kiss, Ratcliffe and Edwards is keen
and the race for the trophy is an in
teresting one. Miss Ratcliffe leads
with two victories, each of the others
have bat one. Miss Edwards did not
play in the last tournament, which
Miss Ratcliffe won after a hard match
with Miss Hotchkiss in the finals. All
three are evenly matched, with the
odds slightly in favor of Miss Hotch
kiss.
The Golden Gate Club will finish
its class single tournament on Wash
ington's birthday. The first and fourth
classes will be played to-morro-w and
the second and th^rd classes on the
21st. The finals of the classes will be
played on the 22d.
The first class cup has been com
peted for only once. J. D. MacGavin
is the holder. MacGavin should win
again, as he is playing a better game
than any of the others in his class.
Will Allen has the best chance of beat
ing the San "Francisco champion.
Allen was badly beaten by the Cali
fornia Club man the last time they
met. Next to Allen, George Baker is
considered the most likely candidate
for class honors. Although Baker is
not so good a player as Allen, he
usually plays MacGavin closer than
Allen does. Clarence Griffin, Charles
Dunlap and Carl Gardner are all play
ing well, but can hardly hope to win
the class.
It would be well to have a shake-up.
Several of the men who have always
played in the first clas$ at the park
could not win the second class. The
following men should comprise the
first class: MacGavin, Allen, G. Baker,
Griffin, Dunlap, Gardner, X. Baker,
Routh, Whitney and Russell. Several
of the best men in the second class are
just about as clever as the poorest in
the first class.
In the second class the best play
ers are George Janes, Horace Mann,
the Hotchkiss brothers and C. Foley.
A. Brabant, who won the third class
in the last tournament, will play in
the second class in future. Brabant
won the third by a narrow margin,
but has improved since then and has a
good chance of winning the second.
Palmar, his partner in doubles, will
probably go in the third.
With Brabant out of the third class
the honors should go to either Herbert
Long, Robert Drolla or Harold Ga
briel. Long is undoubtedly the best,
but is a poor tournament player. In
practice he would be among the best*
in the second class, but falls down ;
miserably in a tournament.
The fourth class honors have been
carried off by M. Long, C. S. Skaggs,
Guerin and Hall. It is expected one
of these four will prove the winner in
the coming tourney.
There will be no tournament on the
California Club courts on the 22d. The
committee will probably decide to hold
a handicap doubles on the 21st and
22d. - The cup holders are Schmidt
and Rolfe. ".Vvi ~h
The return match between Clarence
Griffin of the Golden Gate Club and
Herbert Schmidt of the California
Club will be held on the 28th aY the
park.
There is some talk of a return match
between teams of the two clubs, ' but
nothing definite hajs been arranged.
The California Club men will not play
on the park "courts. The club courts
arc much better than those at the
park, as are the accommodations, and
if the match is ever played it Will be
at the Scott and Bush street courts.
made an excellent showing In the last
tournament and are figured to have a
good chance to. win.
Ninety-four playersâ the full club
membershipâ were drawn in the sin
gles. With this largo entry list it will
take a long lime to run off the event.
It is expected that less than half this
number will enter the doubles. The
event Is open to all club members, but
many of the poorer players will not
be In the list. Partners as well as
opponents will be drawn by lot. Both
tournaments will probably be started
on the 22d. \ /â ;. â 
There will be a meeting of the San
Francisco Scottish Bowling Club next
Thursday night at Scottish Hall. Lar
kin street. At this meeting the draw
ing for the doubles tournament will
be held. Another object of the meet
ing is to fix the time limit of the dif
ferent rounds of the singles tourna

Handicap Over Eighteen Holes
Is Set Down for This Aft
ernoon on the New Schedule
BOGIE CONTEST ARRANGED
Qualifying Round for a 3Iatch
Play Event to Be Held on
the Birthday of Washington
Weather permitting, there will be a
handicap over eighteen holes, msdal
play, thl3 af ternoony on the course of
the San Francisco Golf Club. Two
prizes, one for the best gross score
and the other for the lowest handicap
score, are offered. This . is the first
-event set down on the schedule re
cently prepared by the newly appointed
tournament committee of the San
Francisco Golf Club.
On next Saturday afternoon there will
be a handicap over eighteen holes.*
against "bogey," the players making
the lowest two net scores receiving
prizes.
On Washington's birthday the quali
fying round over eighteen holes, medal
play, with handicap, for a match play
contest will be held, the lowest sixteen
scores to qualify. Each round of
matches must be completed within four
days, and the handicaps will apply
throughout the competition.
On Saturday. March 5. there will be
handicap foursomes, medal play, over
eighteen holes, first and second prizes
being offered. Partners will be drawn
for at -:30 p. m.
On Saturday, March ID, competitions
will be held in driving and in ap
proach-putting, prizes being offered for
each event.
On Saturday. March 25, the qualify
ing round over eighteen holes, medal
play, of a competition for the Council's
cup for men will .be played, the low
est eight scores to qualify. The match
play rounds will be played according
to the convenience of the competitors.
This is the last scheduled competition
that will take place on the course of
the San Francisco Golf Club during
the summer.
The schedule of the Ladies' Annsx
has three events, in addition to the
postponed Council's cup contest, re
maining. The first of these is a handi
cap over eighteen holes, medal play,
set down for Tuesday, the 23d inst.
Two events take place In March.
The length of the holes in a golf
course is being much discussed in Eng
land just now. There are principally
two views with regard to the matter,
one being that of the average player,
who set3 a handicap of six to twelve
strokes, and the other that of the crack
golfer, who drives 200 yards or even
farther, from the tee ,every time, and
v.-ho will get an equally long second
shot, if he has a fairly good lie. Plain
ly, the hole which suits a high-class
golfer may not suit the average player
so well, and the question is whether
the interests of the minority of strong
players or of the majority is to be con
sulted. The conclusion seems to b*
general that the holes should be laid
out to suit the performances of high
class players and that the unskillful
golfers must do the best they can with
the difficulties, hoping ultimately to
reach first-class form.
What, then, is the right length of a
golf hole for a first-class player? The
pleasure of playing a hole is derived
from the possibility of getting one. two
or three long shots, from negotiating or
evading hazards, deciding on the sort
of approach to make, choosing . the
right club and regulating the strength
of the stroke; also from the exercise of
judgment. A strong wind, especially
a head one, seriously alters the charac
ter of a hole, but, as it is an uncertain
and variable element in the question,
it may be disregarded. Whatever the
length of a hole may be. it is thought
it ought not to be possible to reach ";
in one full shot, or in two, unless the
stroke or strokes be of quite surprising
and remarkable force. It should not
be possible for the first-class golfer to
reach a green by one great stroke, or
by two, without the exercise of judg
ment*. .' ~l','_.

The annual meeting of the San Fran
cisco Yacht Club proved a long but an
Interesting one.- The minutes of the
last annual meeting, containing many
amendments to the by-laws, were so
%oluminoT:s that Secretary Hillyer Deu
prey became exhausted by reading
them and called on ex-Secretary W. M.
Edgeil to finish the job.
The regular order of business having
been suspended the meeting proceeded
with the election of officers to serve
for the coming twelve months. The
nominating committee had prepared
a list of regular nominees for the seven
offices of the club, and there was also
.Â« members' ticket, four of the nom
inees on which were the same as those
oil the regular ticket. Three tellers
â were appointed and each member de
posited his ballot when his name was
called from the roll. The total vote
cast was 147. H. H. Jenness received
145 votes for vice commodore. F. Raisch
-146 for port captain, F. A. Robbins 147
for treasurer andÂ»A. G. A. Mueller 146
for financial secretary. W. G. Morrow
was elected commodore by 89 votes to
El cast for Vice Commodore A. C. Lee:
XV. "W. Wilde received 88 votes for re
cording secretary, and J. E. Gray, the
regular nominee, obtained 56; for treas
urer. W. W. Farrar, the nominee on
the members* ticket, was successful.
While the tellers were performing
their task the retiring officers read
their reports. Commodore R. S. Bridge
man's report showed that the fleet of
the club consisted of 39 craft, of which
17 are sloops, 6 yawls, 7 schooners and
the rest launches. Though the roll of
members lost several names by death
resignation or expulsion for non-pay
ment of dues, the club took in enough
new members to offset these losses, and
has 22o active members on its roll.
The commodore suggested that an ad
ditional float moored at the north end
of the clubhouse would be a useful ad
junct.
Secretary Hillyer Peuprc-y's report
eugrgested that a book containing the
corstitution and by-laws, the racing
rules, table of allowances and other
pcrmament matter should be issued,
and that a supplement containing the
list c-f members and the roll of the
fleet should be issued annually. The
report of the treasurer showed that
the gross receipts of the club during
the past year were about $3750, and
that a balance is in hand.
The report of Port Captain W. G.
Morrow commented on the use of the
ways by members, and suggested
that an equitable distribution of the
locker space of the clubhouse was
much needed: that the lockers now
owned by members should be bought
by the club and allotted according to
the needs of the members. As things
now are some members who do not
own any yacht have lockers that are
large enough to use as dressing-rooms,
â while other members have lockers
about the size of a meat safe.
The question of ways owned by the
club gave rise to much discussion. Ex-
Commodore W. X. McCarthy stated
that, in his opinion, the maintenance
of ways for the use of members is
not a function of a yacht club, and
that ways can always be found on
which boats may be haured out. Such
ways will exist at Sausalito. North
Beach and elsewhere as long as there
are yachts that want hauling out and
repairing. The club nreds a boathouse
adjacent to its nresent building much
more than ways and a lot on which
to- erect a boathouse may be obtained
from the town of Sausalito on condi
tion that a public landing stage be
maintained. Ex-Commodore Gutte
having spoken in support of ex-Com
modore W. X. McCarthy, the members
present decided that the club should
not Fpend money in buying land o-n
which to set up ways, but should con
tinue to lease the present v .-ys as long
as possible.
It was decided to s*Â»t aside not less
than 5 per cent of the income of the
club to reduce the mortgage on the
club property.
The new board of directors of the
Corinthian Yacht Club held its first
meeting on Thursday night. An own
ers' meeting will soon be called to dis
cuss the schedule of events for the
coming season.

longshot, which was the medium of a
plunge by those on the inside, tells the
features of the day's racing at Ascot

CLAY DISKS TARE PLACK
OF DUCKS AND QUAIL
Open Hrason for Game Birds Ends
and Trap Shooting Comes in to
Burn Powder.
The members of clubs ownins duck
shooting preserves wiil be out in force
to-morrow, the last Sunday in which
ducks may he killed this season.
Neither ducks nor quail may be killed
after Monday until next October.
The storm has scattered the ducks
over a great area and poor shooting
is expected. The majority of the men
who so out do so to close the season
fittingly with proper festivitiees in
doors rather than in the blinds.
The members of the Montezuma
Gun Club enjoyed a good shoot at
Collinsville last Sunday. Those on
the marsh were Thomas Walsh. Bert
Wyman, President Nickels and W. W.
Richards. The Joint bag^was ninety
ducks. The "cans" which abound on
these famous ponds every year have
been on the absent list recently.
The trap shooters are commencing
where, their brothers of the gun leave
off. They will open this season at
the Ingleside traps on the 21st and
22d insL The tournament will be
under the direction of the Golden Gate
Gun Club. The club has organized
for the season with the following of
ficers: President, W. S. Wattles: vice
president, W. J. Golcher; secretary,
Edgar Forster; board of governors,
Edward Donohoe. Clarence Nauman
and William Murdoch. 'â¢.?Â£
The club decided to do away with
an initiation fee, making the dues $1
per month for the season, which ex
tends over seven months. There will
be three distinct classes. By this sys
tem the average shooter will not meet
the crack at any time. The prizes in
each class will be the same.
There will be four club events in
addition to the Hibbard trophy race.
The programme for the opening: shoot
is the same for each day, seven events
being carded.
The putty of pride may hide the crack
but It cannot heal it.
THE SAN FRANCISCO -"CALL, SATURDAY, . . FEBRUARY 13, 1904.
MUD LARKS CAPTURE FOUR PURSES
IN THE MUDDY GOING AT INGLESIDE
The Pride Defeat
ed a Short Nose
by Flyer.
Nothing but mudlarks had a chance
in the going at Ingleslde yesterday and
speculators brought down four of the
six birds cut loose for them. The two
favorites that disappointed were Red
Bird and The Prrde. While the card
was only a fair one, there was an ex
tremely good crowd in attendance.
An unlooked for quantity. Sir Pres
ton, gave Sir Tom Tiddler, favorite for
the opening event, a hard rub. fair
Preston, with Hildebrand on his back,
made a bold bid far It in the stretch
and it took hard riding.on-the part of
Johnny Daly to land the favorite first
by half- a length. Quiz II, it was" fig
ured, was the horse to beat, but the
McCafferty entry was led out for the
show by Bard Burns.
Next time Red Bird starts she will
run for the Chicken 1 Pickers' Mutual
Aid Society. Elmer Slaughter engaged
Hildebrand to pilot his fllly in the six
furlong -sprint for maiden three-year
olds, and" she v/as immediately made
an even money chance.
HUL.FORD BEATS RED BIRD.
For five-eighths of a mile the fllly
ran like Dick Welles. Then Hulford.
the second choice, waded by her, scor
ing without effort. Jack Little ran to
his notch, finishing in the show. â¢ '
Sol Lichtensteln was touted far and
wide as one of the best things that
ever came over the pike, and he beat
Decoy just a nose \ for the seven-fur
long number following. Bell piloted
Sol, which ruled 9 to 5 favorite, and he
rode one of the best races of his career.
Decoy, always considered a faint-heart
ed horse, ran with exceptional game
nets, and it was only by careful nurs
ing that Bell got the first choice oveV
the line In front. After being cut off in
the back stretch, Mr. Farnhum ran
third. Possart made his first start at
the meeting and was played, but cut
but little figure in the actual running.
FLYER* FINALLY LANDS.
In the Futurity course run next de
cided, Tom Ryan's Dundee gelding
Flyer finally left the hard luck class.
The Pride came in for consistent sup
port at, odds of 8 to 5, while 3^ could
be had about Flyer. J. T-. Sheehan rode
the latter and in a iong drive was
awarded a nose decision over the fa
vorite. Suburban Queen, the pacemak
er for two-thirds of the route, ran a
close third.
There were only, four starters for, the
two-year-old spin at half a mile, and
lack of riders deprived the "event of.
much interest. Hildebrand had the leg
up on Meada, the 11 to 20 favorite, and
in a fierce drive disposed of Eduar.do
by a |iead. G. Bullman. a brother of
John * Bullman, piloted ./ Saccharate,
beating" Willa for show ' honors.*""'*'* â¢'''-'/ :
On past mud performances Dungari-;
non looked a certainty for the final
mile selling run and with W. Knapp
in the saddle the filly won hands down.
She was an 8 to 5 favorite, and led Mr.
Dingle out with pounds lo spare. Al
bemar'.e ran a poor race.
NOTES OF THE TRACK.
Hildebrand rode but one winner.
Twice he finished on place horses, was
once third and on two occasions was
unplaced.
In future the entry of F. W. Brode
will be refused. Trainer Dean has been
reinstated.
"Plunger" Joe Yeager, his crew and
Jockey Hildebrand will depart for Los
Angeles to-night. After a short so
journ there they will journey on to
Memphis. Joe leaves about $65,000 to
the bad, it is said, but a more gentle
manly turfman never booked oft the
local tracks. He purchased the con
tract on Jockey Hildebrand from Vic
Gilbert for $5000, and no doubt secured
a bargain. His operations were always
above board, he oftentimes wagering
a fortune on some other horse when
Kildebrand would land- the winner. It
is to be hoped he will pay San Fran
cisco a visit next season, when fortune
may treat him moYe kindly.
The feature event of the card this
afternoon will be the Palace Hotel
handicap at one and an eighth miles.
It is a valuable stake, the added money
amounting to $2000. The line-up will
ba about the same as in the Burns
handicap.

TRADE OUTLOOK
IS FAVORABLE
Outbreak in Orient and Collapse
. of Cotton Boom Have but
Slight Effect on .the Market
NEW YORK, Feb. 12.â R. G. Dun &
Co.'s weekly review of trade to-mor
row will say: ,
War, fire and cotton were the adverse
factors in the weeli. yet the country
stood the shock remarkably well arid
there are numerous encouraging symp
toms. To a large degree the outbreak
of hostilities in the Orient and the col
lapse of the cotton boom had been dis
counted and the dl&istrous loss of the
conflagration was offset very largely
by the stimulus it will give to many
industries, notably structural steel/ In
restoring Baltimore there will be great
activity in the building trades, while
large stocks of goods must be replaced
and orders filled by jobbers and manu
facturers elsewhere.
Buyers are' arriving in this city in:
large' numbers from all sections of the
country and there is a good demand
for leading staple lines e with notable
urgency for prompt shipment of cotton
goods.. The Jabor situation throughout
the country is almost devoid of fric
tion. More or less traffic congestion
results from the weather and this fact
accounts for the small loss of 1.7 per
cent in railway earnings during Janu^
ary. Actual business is still restricted'
in the iron and steel industry, but there
is' more confidence in the, future'; and
the extensive starting of plants by the
leading producers suggests that foreign
markets will be entered. more aggres
sively than ever before. Â»â¢
Hides are less firm, although large
sales have occurred at the concessions. â¢!

ROLES AGAINST
THE TRUST LAW
District Court of Iowa Finds
That the Law Passed by That
State Is Unconstitutional
WATERLOO, la., Feb. 12.â In a de
cision sustaining a demurrer in the case
of the State of Iowa against the Illinois
Central, Chicago, Rock Island and Pa
cific and GrÂ«at Western railways, in
dicted under a charge of conspiracy in
fixing the . amount of demurrage
charges, Judge Franklin C. Platt in the
mstrict -Court has declared the Iowa
trust law unconstitutional and finds for
the. defendant. railways. .
Last August the three railways lead
ing into Waterloo forced a demurrage
charge of 52 for every twenty-four
hours a freight car was delayed In
excess of forty-eight hours. It was be
lieved the railways were thereby amen
able, to a section of the code which pro
vides that any persons .or corporations
entering into an agreement to fix the
price of any article of merchandise or
commodity shall be guilty of conspir
acy. ;
. Another section provides as a penalty
a fine of not less than one nor more
than : 20. per cent of the capital stock
of the offending company or person.
This section of the law Judge Platt de
clares is in contravention to the four
teenth amendment to the constitution
of the United States and consequently
unconstitutional.,. .Under this section
the minimum fine which, could â  be im
posed on the three railways would be
$2,280,000, of which the County Attorney
would recelvft $450,000. n
The Chicago,' Rock Island and Pa
cific, being an 'Illinois corporation,
would also forfeit its franchise in Iowa

Since Sport Is Promoted
but One Day in Each Week
The Belle Brandon challenge cup
stake for greyhounds whelped last year,
which will be run on Washington's
birthday, will be an event out of the
ordinary this season. It is expected
at least thirty-two puppies will start,
where in other years from sixteen to
twenty-four were considered a repre
sentative entry.
It will be unique in this that not one
of the fashionably bred youngsters hao
been seen in public, so there will be no
line on their form. Dr. F. P. Clark of
Stockton will be represented by some
Imp. Fine Fire-Maid of Erin youngsters
which are pronounced of great prom
ise.
Dan Riordan will start the first of
Ireland's progeny, some puppies out uf
Mollie R.
Dr. J. J. Gaynor of Eureka will be
represented by some Imp. Dudley Dia
mond-Schillings Best puppies and also
some by Imp. Hawker-Pearl Pasha.
James Sweeney expects to show some
crackajacks. He will start some by
Rocker-Gallant Foe, Rocker-Imp. Fiery
Face and Imp. Fortuna Favente-Rol-
Iicking Airs.
J. J. Lavin of St. Louis has sent out
the pick of his kennels by Imp. Fetter
Free-Floradora. They are likely look
ing and as the Fetter Free's have been
showing early speed these may be
wonders.
Ed Gilbert has some puppies by St.
Croix-Imp. Dora B. The sire is by the
famous Connemara. He was Injured
when young and was never coursed.
Dr. Walsh pins his hopes for the cup
011 a puppy by Pasha Pleasant-Belle
Rocket. S. R. Mount's entries* are by
Gold Hill-Gold Lace. Jame3 Carroll
has some puppies by Imp. Bright Gold-
Columbia. P. P, Callan will start some
by Gambit-Molsey. Thomas Hall, the
veteran Merced coursing man, will send
up six of the progeny of Johnny Rex.
. The California Plate, for the older
dogs, will be run in conjunction with
the Belle Brandon. At least sixty-four
entries will be received, the largest in
the history of the stake. There will
also be a consolation event. The total
prize money for the meeting will be
JltfOO.
Paul Heard, secretary of the Abilene
(Kans.) Coursing Club, and one of th.Â»
best known leashmen in the Middle
West, was killed recently. A greyhound
tripped a horse he was riding and he
was thrown heavily, his skull being
fractured.
Since coursing has been limited to
one day in the week the attendance
at both parks has increased and the
quality of the greyhounds has ap
parently improved, the poorer dogs be
ing excluded. This is particularly no
ticeable this week, when the class is
especially good. The Union Park stake
is a representative one, including the
fastest greyhounds from the Middle
West and from the south These are
pitted against Pocatelll, Fair Tarlee
and other flyers.
The first course to-morrow will be
run upon the arrival of the 10:15 a. m.
train. The likely winners. in the first
round look to be:
Misa Green. Queen"s Motto. Barge. Rocker

The card at Ingleside Park is made
up of a champion stake and an open
event. The first brace of- dogs will
be slipped at 10 o'clock. The first
round of the open stake will be run
first. The likely winners look to be:

OLYMPIANS STAND
FOR PURITY IN
ATHLETIC SPORT
Declare That Any Jlember Box
in.? for Outlaw Club "Will
Be Made a Professional
FIGHTERS DO NOT APPEAR
Teddie Wolfe Gains Easy Vic
tory Over George Braun at
Lincoln Club in Four Rounds
The directors of the Olympic Ath
letic Club met last night and took a
decided stand against the new Califor
nia Amateur Athletic Association,
which aspires to control the "amateur"
fighting game here and in Oakland.
The Olympic Club will stand by the
Pacific Athletic Association in its
struggle for purity in athletics and
will not recognize the new organiza
tion.
The directors decided unanimously
last night to professionalize any ath
lete of the club who appears In a box
ing contest held under the auspices of
the California Amateur Athletic Asso
ciation. This decision Is final and it
will have its effect on the boxers of
the club.
George Braun. who fought in the
main event of the Lincoln Club's show
last night, will, without doubt, be de
clared a professional. He is the only
man from the Olympic Club who ap
peared and his amateur standing is as
good as ruined.
The principal boxers carded to con
test at the Lincoln Club exhibition last
night heeded the warning of the Pacific
Athletic Association officials and did
not appear.
Instead of Carroll and Martin, the
Lincoln Club substituted Braun and
Teddy'Wolfe for the main event. Wolfe
proved an easy winner. In every round
he had a decided lead over Braun and
the latter seemed unable to land a good
punch.
Wolfe opened the fourth and last
round of the bout with a rush. He
chased his opponent around the ring
and ha:l mm going. He crossed Braun
six tim-s and finally landed a vicious
uppe.-cu 1 : on the Jaw. Braun dropped
to the floor and hla seconds then
threw up the sponge.
George Larkin lost to Joe Podesta in
four rounds. Podesta did most of the
leading, but Larkin fought bitterly
throushoul and many were of the opin
ion that ht- should have been declared
the victor. Al Elkins suffered the first
defeat of hÂ»s career, losing a tame four
roun 1 cÂ«>nÂ«ost to Jack O'Brien.
Jack D^yle knocked out Charley
Webber in three rounds. Jessie Corn
well g,ot the decision over Denny
Byrnos a:Â»tl Dick Cullen outpointed Abe
Label in a four-round battle. Three
other boxers besides Carroll and Martin
failed to put in an appearance and
substitutes had to be secured.
Lone Knocks Out Herrcra.
AXACON'DA. Mont.. Feb. 12. â Au
relio Herrera. the Mexican, was
knocked out in the third round in a
contest to-night with Louie Long. The
fight was to have gone twenty rounds.
The betting was all in favor of Her
rera. Long showed himself the Mexi
can's superior at both long range and
infighting. In the third Long landed a
terrific right to the jaw and Herrera
went down. When they came together
again Long went at Herrera like a
tiger, twice putting him to the mat.
the second time putting him completely
out.
.Will Talk for Stanford Cup.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Feb. 11.

QUESTION' OF IXSAVITY
STUMPS THE TALES3IEX
Ten Jurors Accepted In Two Days to
Try Edmond dc Labrousse, Who
Is Charged With Murder.
The impaneling of a jury in Judge
Dunne's court to try the case of Ed
mond de Labrousse. charged with the
murder of Hiss Marie Jordan in front
of her mother's residence, 1459 Sacra
mento street, on September 29. was con
tinued all day yesterday. Out of forty
flve talesmen examined only three were
accepted. They were Michael J. Balfe,
John McDoneil and A. K. Grant. Seven
jurors were acceDted on Thursday and
two more are required to complete the
panel. A special venire was issued re
turnable on Monday morning.
The question that stumped most of
the talesmen v.as one put by the de
fendant's attorneys as to whether they
would give the defendant the benefit of
a r'ea of temporary insanity Jf the ev
idence Fustained such a plea. The an
swer was generally in the negative.
Labrousse seems to have- an inex
haustible supply of tears. On Thurs
day he cried most of the time he was
in curt and yesterday his tears flowed
freoJy.

TRANSPORT SURGEON'S JUDGMENT
PREVENTS DETENTION IN QUARANTINE
Logan Arrives From the Philippines With the Twenty-
Seventh Infantry and Other Soldiers and Is
Passed by the Federal Doctors in Record Time
STEAMSHIP CITY OF PUEBLA. WHICH ARPvIVED YESTERDAY FROM PUGET SOUND, TWENTY- FOUR HOURS
LATE. HAVING BEEN DETAINED BY THE SOUTHWESTERLY GALE, THROUGH WHICH SHE STAG
GERED FROM CAPE FLATTERY TO THE GOLDEN GATE. Â«
The army transport Logan. Captain
Stinson in command, arrived yesterday
from the Philippines and instead of be
ingr held or even delayed in quarantine,
as had been anticipated, v.as given rec
ord dispatch by the Federal health offi
cials. Two days after the I-o^an left
Nagasaki a mild case of smallpox de
veloped, the victim being an enlisted
mart. He was convalescent when the
transport reached Honolulu, where the
invalid was sent ashore. That this case
of sickness did not result in the ves
sel's being delayed in quarantine was
due to the action taken by Captain W.
T. Davis, the transport surgeon, who
was highly complimented by Dr. Cum
mings on the good judgment he had
shown.
When he discovered the case Dr. Da
vis isolated the patient and the hos
pital, disinfected the troop deck, fumi
gated bedding and hospital with for
maline gas and vaccinated everybody
on board. Those that had been exposed
to the infection were inspected twice
a day and their temperatures taken.
Dr. Davis' report satisfied the quaran
tine officials that not only was there no
danger of smallpox, but that the trans
port surgeon's campaign of disinfec
tion had been so thorough that if any
germs had survived they were of a kind
not yet classified.
The Logan had fine weather until
within sight of port. She was inside
the Farallones early Thursday night,
but the weather setting in thick and
the storm increasing. Captain Stinson
ran for the open sea and remained
where he had plenty of room until day
light rendered navigation less risky.
In spite of the fact that she has seen
more constant service than other trans
ports, the Logan reached port looking
clean as when she sailed and is ready.
If again necessary, to recross the Pacific
as soon as she can be loaded with
stores.
The Logan brought the officers and
men of - the Twenty-seventh United
States Infantry, 321 enlisted men of
provisional companies, 69 casuals, 1 in
sane soldier, 29 discharged soldiers, 44
general prisoners, 1 deported citizen,
L. C. Chamberlain by name; 71 enlisted
men of the Marine Corps and 3 Jackies.
Colonel Samuel R. Whitall was In

WANT NO COMPETITION
Wheat Growers Now Converse
Along the liarbcd Wire
fences Dividing Their Fields
TACOMA, Feb. 12.â The Pacific States
Telephone Company is negotiating with
the Palouse district business men for
the purchase of the local telephone ex
change. E. C. Drews of the Pacific
States company has submitted a prop
osition to the owners which -will prob
ably be accepted. This is a move on
the part of the Pacific States Telephone
Company to shut out competing com
panies from that territory.
The' contemplated purchase by the
company includes the system at Pa
louse and the farmers' lines through the
wheat district. The latter lines were
commenced by the wheat growers about
three years ago and barbed wire fences
are used for the current. At Genesee,
Idaho, the Pacific States company was
able to buy the system, but the Genesee
company retained the suburban and
farmers* line. The Palouse telephone
exchange is valued at $3000, at which
price the Pacific States company of
fered to ' buy.

UATlLEY â The Japanese are in this market
fcr Barley, according to current report on

' 1 *.te,d a rÂ«irchasÂ« of 6000 tons of Feed. This
flight explain why the ilay option advanced
in the face of a pouring rain, while the De
eeir.ber option declined. Only a few days ago
they took a canto of 2500 tons up north. The
casa train Is naturally firm under this Jap
anese demand, which in large enough to coun
terbalance the natural bearish effect -of the
rain. Sale* of Feed at $1 12% were reported. ,

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
Receii-ts of Potatoer were light, but trad
ing was >iuiet owing to the etorm and prices
of all descriptions were unchanged. It is re
portÂ«d on coed authority that the price ot
high-grade Orison Burbanka has been ad
vanced to Jl 12^ per cental at primary ship
ping points, thus rendering it certain that
high prices will rule in this market for some
time. No more Sweet Potatoes came In and
the car that was received on the preceding day
was telling slowly at the previously quoted
rate. Onions were firm, with dealers antici
pating a higher ranstÂ» of prices. Supplies of
Oregon now on the way to this market are
owned by one house and it is reported that
phipoers in Nevada have taken advantage of
the scarcity hf re and advanced prices to J2 50
per cental at t'hlppInE points.
There was a good demand for choice vegeta
bles for shipment on the Portland steamer, but
prices were 100 high to permit any great move
ment In that direction. Local trade waÂ» quirt
owing to the stormy weather, but as supplies
of most descriptions were limited dealers ex
perienced no difficulty in disposing of good
stock. Rhubarb was in moderate receipt and
cleaned up well at unchanged rates. New
Potatoes were dull at 2^3c per pound.

Poultry and Game.
There, was continued firmnesa in Poultry,
as there was r.o Western offering and receipts
of domestic stock were light. Fine largo
young fowls were eagerly sought after, par
ticularly by the Chinese, and occasional sale*
of exceptionally fine stock were reported at
better than the quoted rates. A car of Wert
ern falls due to-day. Thirty-four cases of
dressed Turkeys caroe in and a few email lots
of prime fancy stock sold at a substantial ad
vance over the top quotation. Poor and

Butter, Cheese and Eggs. ; ~
It is the general opinion that the Butter
market has got to go, ae the demand is slug
gish, stocks are large and the heavy rain tends
to produce a marked Increase In the produc
tion Irom now on. Cards and letters are be
ing sent to outside points offering creamery
at 26c, while spot lots are freely offered at
2"0'/5(c.' The feeling; Is decidedly weak. .
Cheese Is lower again and the weakness Is
general all over the street. The few houiÂ»es
which have been flrm with, their favorite
brands heretofore have weakened at last and
have ccme down to the level of the general
market. Stocks continue excessive.
While there is no actual decline in Eggs
the weakness is Increasing and 25c ta now
the top of the market except In a small way.
Supplies continue liberal.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
Stocks of all grades of Oranges were heavy
and all dealers were. willing to make liberal
concessions In order to effect sales, but the
storm kept buyers away from the market and
there was not enough business to warrant any
change In the quotations. All other Citrus
fruits shared in the general dullness and prices
were nominally unchanged. Jobbers mani
fested but Uttie Interest in the Orange auc

FOSTER -AND OREAR WANT
TO CONDUCT XEWS STAND
Charge Fraud in Application to Court
to Prevent Commissioners Glv
1 ins Privilege to Rooney.
Charles Foster and Charles Orear.
who for a number of years past have
conducted the news stand at the ferry
depot, filed a suit yesterday for an In
junction restraining the Board of
Harbor Commissioners from leasing
the privilege the petitioners have en
joyed for so many years to John F.
Rooney, a brother-in-law of Harbor
Commissioner Spear.
They charge that unless the board
is onjo'ned Rooney will be given the
privilege because of Spear's influence,
in the face of the fact that they have
offered the Commissioners $1500 a
month rent for the use of the space
they have enjoyed at a monthly ren
tal of $430.
The plaintiffs allege that when th'.y
first learned that the board intended
to award the privilege, to Rooney they
were paying a rental of $4 30 a montn.
They immediately, offered $600 for the
privilege and subsequently offered
$1180 when they learned that Rooney
was the choice of the Commissioner*.
NotwithstandfnK their - raise in their
bid, the plaintiffs say, the Commis
sioners made up their mind to give
the privilege to Rooney and refused to
reopen the bids when the plaintiffs
offered to pay $1500 a month for what
they formerly enjoyed for. $430.
They ask for an injunction on the
ground that the board, if allowed t>
make the award to Rooney, will com
mit,a fraud upon the people of the
State of California. They say that
Rooney has never offered a bid for
the privilege and he has been favored
solely because of the presence udoii
the board of Charles H. Spear, hJa
brother-in-law.
BRADLEY DEX1ES CHARGES
3IADE BY STOCKHOLDERS
F. W. Bradley and other directors
of the Oroville Gold Dredging and
Exploration Company filed an answer
yesterday to the suit brought aKJin3t
them by John Hays Hammoni an<l
oU>'jr stockholders in the mining coni
p^.ny named. Bradley and co-defond
anu deny that there exists any icheme
to defraud the plaintiffs and say that
there is no truth in the charge made
by Hammond and others that the af
fairs of the company are grossly mis
managed. They also deny that *Ed
tvin Schwab, W. C. Webb, W. R. Barry
and A. Granger are without interest
in the company and that they are
duiftmy directors placed on the direc
torate to act as tools and puppets o!
\V. H. Crocker and F. W. Bradley.
In regard to the charge that the de
fendants issued false proxies and sold
40,000 shares of stock and converted
the proceeds to their own benefit the
defendants say that it is absolutely
without foundation. They admit sell
ing the stock, but claim that the
money they received for it was invest
ed ,in new machinery and tools.

Police Think They Are Same
31en That Robbed Night Bar
tender About Two Weeks Ago
Two robbers "held up" James P.
Dwyers saloon at S42',2 Seventh street
at an early hour yesterday morning.
The police believp they are the same
n:cn that robbed James Corcoran, night
bartender in a saloon at Tenth and
Market streetF. about two weeks ago.
Dwyer was alone in his saloon when
two masked men entered. Each drew
a revolver and ordered Dwyer to throw
up his hands. He was then command
ed to walk into a rcar - room and not
make an outcry. ; The robbers opened
the cash register and took ?14 05, ali
that it contained.
Then they entered the rear room,
where Dwyer was patiently holding his
hands aV>ft, and relieved him of his
sold watch, chain and charm, aggre
gating in value 5175, and his poeUet
book, containing several foreign coins
aedft nickel. The charm was presented
to Dwyer about two years ago by the
Foresters' court to which he belongs.
"Now come along with us." one of
thrm said, and they backed him into
a hallway. 'If you move from there. '
the robber remarked, "within the next
ten minutes we will return and kill
you." The two thereupon disappeared
through the front Â«Ioor.
Dwyer did not notify the police for
nearly an hour. Detectives were de
tailed on, the case, but no trace of the
bold robbers could be found. Dwyer
said thev were both perfectly cool and
went about the business in a profes
sional manner.

not suit Judge Hunt and he put the

SEEKS RETURN
OF TAXES PAID
Petition of the Hobbs Estate
for the Return of $1600 Is
Opposed by Assessor Dodge
CJTY ATTORNEY TO ADVISE
Merchants' Association Will
Prepare * Ordinance Rcgulat
iug Spur Track Privileges'
The Supervisors' Judiciary Commit
tee yesterday referred to the City At
torney the petition of the J. K. C.
Hobbs estate for the return of taxes in
the sum of $1600 paid on personal prop
erty claimed to be exempt from taxa
tion. Assessor Dodge refused- to
recommend a reconsideration of the
assessment for the reasons contained
in the following communication:
In February. lWKi the executors of the
estate of J. K. C. Hobbs held the sum of
J:Â«'.17r., deposited in commercial banks In the
city. During that month and before Maroli
2. 1903. the <lay on which taxes attached,
the executors drew the money lrom the banks
and invested it in non-assessable bonds. These
bonds, according to the sworn statement of
the executor?, a copy of which is attached,
were purchased for the purpose of evading
the payment of taxes on the money. As the
law does not permit such an evasion of tax
ation I assessed the money.
In the face of th? admission in the final
account and report of the executors I submit
to your committee that this is a case in
which the oath, which the law prescribes
muct be made by each taxpayer, cannot be
taken by the attorney or executors of this
estate. This oath is as follows: "I swear
that I have not in any manner whatsoever
transferred or disposed of any property, or
p!ace.i any property out of said county or
my possession, for the purpoFe of avoiding
any assessment on the same or makinc this
tax statement."
L.AKGI-: ESTATES OFFENDERS.
This office in the past has had much dif
ntulty in collecting any tax on the personal
property of large estates. It has not been
uncommon to find estate? with hundreds of
thousands or dollars of taxable personal prop
erty, none or which had been returned to
the Assessor during the IifÂ«Â» of the owner, and
which it has been impossible to collect taxes
on while the estate was being administered.
Prominent attorneys have been known to pre
vent the filing of an inventory of an estate
until after the close of the assessment season
so that the Assessor mirht not learn of the
taxable personal property thereof. Immedi
ately after my books were closed the lons
dc'.ayed appraisement would be filed showing
aji immense amount of taxable property which,
would then be distributed or Invested" in non
taxable securities. *>o that when the next tax
period came around it had all vanished, as
far as th*> Assessor was concerned. Even
these to whom it was distributed knew noth
ing of its whereabouts. I believe such prop
erty, when it comes to the surface once onlv
during Its lifetime, or rather at the end of
the lifetime of its possessor, should pay taxes.
W. H. Jordan, executor of the estate,
informed the committee that there had
been no willful intention to evade the
payment of taxes, but the bonds were
purchased to provide revenue for the
heirs?. The committee will ask the City
Attorney if it has any legal right to
return the taxes.
REGULATE SPUR TRACKS
The Supervisors' Joint Committee on
Judiciary and Streets yesterday re
quested the Merchants' Association to
prepare an ordinance providing regula
tions for spur track privileges which
may hereafter be granted t>y the Board
of Supervisors. A number of mer
chants were present at the meeting and
agreed that certain conditions should
be imposed upon those securing spur
track privileges.
At Supervisor Brandenstein's sug
gestion L. M. King, secretary of the
Merchants' Association, was asked to
incorporate in the proposed ordinance
conditions that a permit must first be
secured to lay a spur track and the
privilege shall be at the pleasure of the
board. Other conditions will include a
limitation of the time during which
cars shall be allowed to stand on the
tracks and a requirement that the
track portion shall be paved by the
holder of the spur track privilege. King
agreed to confer with the Harbor Com
missioners in preparing the ordinance
with special reference to the switching
of cars.
Piercy Denounces His Brother.
The hearing of the application of
Andrew Piercy for letters of admin
istration upon the ectate of his mother.
Mary Piercy, was vigorously opposed
yesterday in the Probate Court by the
petitioner's brother, Edward Piercy^
on the ground that the petitioner was
a drunkard and a gambler aiid unfit
to handle the estate. At the very last
moment, however, after Edward
Piercy had accused his brother of
committing almost every crime on
th<Â» calendar, he admitted that he op
posed the petitioner because he "wish
ed to get even with him." The court
put the matter over for a further
hearing.
Will Form Imposing Procession.
The members of the Gentlemen's
Sodality of the Immaculate Concep
tion of the Blessed Virgin will meet at
9:20 o'clock to-morrow morning at
their chapel on Hayes street and,
headed by banners and dressed In the
regalia of the society, will march in
imposing procession to St. Ignatius
Church, where they will receive holy
communion. A very large attendance
Is expected.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL.. SATURDAY. FKBRUARY, 1.1. 1904.
NATIONAL GUARD CAPTAIN
ACCUSED OF EMBEZZLEMENT
George T. Ballinger, Bookkeeper for California
Art' Glass Works, Is Arrested on a Warrant
Sworn Out by Employer, William Schroeder
George T. Ballinger, captain of Com
pany A of the California * National
Guard and former first lieutenant in
the First California Volunteers, has
been charged by his employer. Presi
dent William Schroeder of the Cali
fornia Art Glass Works at 120 Post
street, with embezzling the sum of
$4376 38. Schroeder swore to a war
rant yesterday charging his one time
trusted bookkeeper with felony embez
zlement and Ballinger was arrested by
Detective Coleman.
According to the story told by Presi
dent Schroeder, Ballinger does not deny
that he pilfered the company's funds.
It is claimed that he attempted to make
some sort of a settlement when con
fronted with the fact that his employ
ers knew of his peculations and was
about to order his arrest. Ballinger,
it is alleged, offered to give his home
at 457 Frederick street to square the
amount of his thefts, and the matter
was about to be hushed, when, it Is
said, Ballinger and Schroeder disagreed
as to the amount of the peculations.
Ballinger then told Schroeder to do
whatever he wanted and, it is said, left
the president in a rage.
The alleged attempt at settlement oc
curred Thursday afternoon and yes
terday morning the warrant was is
sued. Ballinger's wife was seen at her
home on Frederick street, and she
hinted at jealousy as the cause of the
issuance of a warrant for the- arrest
of her husband. She says that Schroed
er is angry because her husband in
tended going into the art glass busi
ness for himself.
Ballinger has been with the Califor
nia Art Glass Works for more than
fifteen years, and was always regarded
as an honest and reliable employe. All
of the bookkeeping was intrusted to
him and the accused man was allowed
to keep them in any way he. saw fit.
A few weeks ago President Schroeder
became suspicious on finding. that the
income of the firm was not â¢ as large
as it should be from the amount of
work done. An expert was put on the
books and, it is claimed, a shortage of
$4000 fouqd.
A few weeks ago Ballinger- became
interested in a company which pur
chased the art glass firm of Moretti
& Sammann at 223 Tenth street. It
is alleged by the police that Ballinger
used a portion of the money pilfered
from his employer , in purchasing an
interest in the glass works. The new
firm was to be known as the Sierra Art
Glass Works. It is also alleged that
Ballinger paid In -part for the. aome
he bAught shortly after . his- iiiSrriage
two years ago vlth some of the' money
belonging to the California Art -Glass
Works.
George T. Ballinger served' as first
lieutenant of Company A of the First
California Volunteers- in the'Philip
pines, and was recommended by, Gen
eral Otis for promotion^ to the rank of
captain in the regular -army for "gal
lantry. When he returned '.: from the
war he resumed his position .with- the
California Art Glass Works, '.where he
was employed up to' a few days ago.
He Is still captain of ; Company A of
the State National. Guard..
Ballinger seemed to lightly, treat the
charge that had, been preferred against
him. "They say that I am an embez
zler, but they will have to prove it. I
never took any of.the u funds of the Cali
fornia Art Glass. Company .and > I am 1
not afraid to face. the charge,"'he said. 1
Ballinger did not remain -in jail 'ldng>
His bail, fixed by Judge , Cabahiss at
$10,000, was given- by; Colonel Thomas
F. Barry and J. C/0!Connor.' ' .
Ballinger's friends cannot" believe that
he is guilty of the charge that has been
made against .him. "What" would he
want the money for, they all ask?'' Ojie.
of the accused man's most '.intimate
friends hinted that Ballinger may. have
spent the money, if he took It,' on his
company In the National Guard.
He was passionately devoted "to his
military company, they say. . Ballin
ger's denial of the theft is in direct con
tradiction to the statement made by
Schroeder thatBallinger had agreed to
make restitution for the amount stolen,
but failed to do so. ,
President .Schroeder attempted to
have the warrant for Ballinger's arrest
issued Thursday morning, . but Judge
Cabaniss. refused to Issue it until
Schroeder could show him some evi
dence of the accused man's guilt. Yes
terday morning Schroeder appeared r in
court with the company's â  books and
the expert who examined them. . Then
the warrant was issued.
â¢ ' It ' Is doubtful whether . the accused
man's friends " will allow, him' " to" be

A little later, he purchased a house at

lives. The house and lot are valued
at something over $3000. Ballinger was

GRAND JURY RECOOIEXDS
SAFEGUARDS IX THEATERS
Directs Closing. of Playhouses If Re
quirements Are Xot Complied
With in Thirty Days.
The Grand Jury met yesterday and
adopted a resolution recommending
certain safeguards against fire and
panic in theaters. Among the rec
ommendations is one that the Chief of
Police detail two police" officers for
duty inside each of the large theaters
for the better protection of the audi-
ences.
Again the Grand Jury recommends
that proper exits be installed in all
theaters, together with an automatic
overhead sprinkler. The exits are to
be sufficiently wide to afford proper
egress and will be subject to the in
spection of the Chief of the Fire De
partment, who shall also pass on the.
effectiveness of the sprinkling sys
tem.
The materials of th,e curtains are to
be submitted to the City Chemist for
analysis to determine if they are fire
proof. The Grand Jury directs that
if these conditions are not complied
with In thirty days the theaters are
to be closed until such time as the
requirements are complied with.
Copies of the resolution were or
dered sent to the Board of Public
Works and the Chief of Police.
SHOW BUSINESS IS BAD
EAST OF' THE ROCKIES
3Ianager Leahy of Tivoli Returns and
Says Condition of Theaters Could
Hardly Be Worse.
Manager W. H. Leahy of the Tivoli,
who returned yesterday from a visit to
New York, says that the distressful
condition of the theatrical business in
the metropolis and throughout the
East could hardly be overestimated.
"In New York." he said, "there are
several big musical spectacles running
to ruinous business, and why they are
kept before the public is more than I
can understand. Their quality, how
ever, does not entitle them to much
better patronage, as a poorer lot of
shows has seldom been produced in one
season. Several of the houses with
meritorious dramatic offerings are do-
Ing fairly good business."
Mr. Leahy secured the exclusive
right to produce In San Francisco sev
eral of the latest operatic J successes,
and they "will be seen during the com
ing year at the Tivoli.
