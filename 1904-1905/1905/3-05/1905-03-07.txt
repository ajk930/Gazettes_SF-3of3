POISON IN CASCARA CAPSULES GIVEN MRS.
STANFORD BY MISS BERNER
Dr. C. B. Wood, who performed the autopsy on the body of Mrs. Stanford, testified at the inquest in Honolulu yesterday that he found the usual post
mortem appearances indicating strychnine poisoning. All the organs had been in a very healthful condition.
A startling development of the day was the announcement of the chemists that they had discovered strychnine in the cascarets, one of which was given
Mrs. Stanford by Miss Bertha Berner at the same time she gave her the bicarbonate of soda.
POISON IN THE
CAPSULES GIVEN

Analysis Shows Existence of
Nux Vomica in Medicine
Taken by Victim,
HONOLULU, March â The reason for the failure of the chemists to make their report
last night of the analysis of Mrs. Stanford's stomach was the startling: discovery that the cas
caret capsules, one of which Mrs. Stanford took at the same time she took the bicarbonate of
soda before retiring the night of her death, also contained strychnine. , . .â â¢ -V ;
The chemists had finished the analysis of all organs of the body, when they were unex
pectcdJy- called on to test the cascaret capsules, were kept by Miss Bcruer. &he #avc
one to Mrs. Stanford at the same time the dose of bicarbonate of soda was prepared. >'
On being analyzed the cascarets were found to contain mix vomica or strychnine. The
chemists were then confronted with the complication of the presence of the same poison in
both medicines administered to Mrs. Stanford. The apparent difficulty of determining which
blight have caused death placed them in a peculiar predicament.
They could not determine whether there was enough poison in the mix vomica alone or
in the bicarbonate alone or whether the quantity in both medicines was necessary to produce
death. This question will not be determined for a day or two.
Miss Berner was immediately questioned about the capsules, and brought forth a pre
scription given her many years ago by a San Francisco physician. This gave poison as one of
. the component parts of the capsule, the prescription calling for twenty-four capsules every
time, it was. filled. :vv
3Hss Berner had the prescription made np over and over again during the many years,
she explained, frequently using them herself and administering them to others, never with
evil effects. |
Chemist Duncan reported his new discovery Sunday night to the police authorities, and
was present when Miss Berner was questioned and produced the prescription.
Although strychnine was found mixed in the bicarbonate, the added portion in the cas
caret may have been the extra quantity required to. bring on death.
The latest discovery was a sensational surprise to the chemists, the police and High
Sheriff Henry, and because of it the announcement of the result of the analysis of the stomach
was withheld. â  %'&s â â â¢! % y Ji

a small table in the inner room.

CAPTAIN OF DETECTIVES JOSEPH J. BURNETT QUESTIONING MISS ELIZABETH RICHMOND YESTERDAY IN HIS OFFICE.
WILL IGNORES
SENATOR'S KIN
Jerome Stanford Dissatisfied,
but No Contest Likely.
Some feeling of dissatisfaction and
resentment is shown by Jerome Stan
ford, a nephew of the late Senator
Stanford, over the provisions of
Mrs. Stanford's will. He aptly ex
presses it in the remark, "She left
money to Chinese, bootblacks and all,
but remembered not one of the Stan
fords."
Regarding the probability of con
testing the will, Mr. Stanford was par
ticularly reticent and declined to af
firm or deny. He stoutly maintained
that he had arrived at no conclusion.
The future, he added, must be governed
by conditions.
Senator Stanford left this nephew, as
he did to others, the sum of $100,000.
But it seems that before paying Jer
ome Stanford his legacy, Mrs. Stan
ford settled his outstanding obligations
and after these were paid only $30,000
remained for him.
It is said that there was an under
standing between Senator Stanford and
his wife that the one who survived
should make provision in his or her
will for the blood relations of the orher.
If this fact could be establishedâ a thing
that would be difficult to do â Jerome
Stanford might possibly gain some
thing from a contest. Otherwise he
would not, for if the will should be
made inoperative, the law, of succession
.would give him no shaxe in the estate,
he being no kin of the testatrix,
"The late Senator Stanford," said
Jerome Stanford yesterday, "in his will
remembered all his nephews and
nieces, and, in fact, all of his rela
tives. The Lathrop relations were
generously treated, and each nephew
and niece received $100,000. Now, al
though I have always had pleasant
and friendly relations with Mrs. Stan
ford, I think she showed great discour
tesy in refusing tÂ° equal the Senator's
generosity and similarly remember the
Stanford branch in her will.
LEFT OUT JOSIAH STANFORD.
"There is Josiah Stanford Jr., for in
stance, who is a nephew of Mrs. Stan
ford and son of Senator Stanford's
brother. During the lifetime of Josiah
Stanford Sr. Mrs. Stanford was a con
stant visitor at his home and often met
her nephew. She appeared at all times
to be friendly to Josiah Stanford Jr..
and it was a great surprise to me that
he was not remembered.
"It is true Josiah received $100,000 at
his uncle's death, but for that matter
so did the Lathrop branch, and al
though I will not speak for my brother,
I must say that I do not think the
treatment accorded to the Stanford
side of the family in the will was at
all right. Josiah Stanford is now liv
ing at Warm Springs, Alameda Coun
ty."
Again Mr. Stanford was asked if he
would contest the will and again
evaded direct answer. Despite many
questions he refused to say more than
that the idea had not entered his head
before. On being pressed further on
the question he reiterated his former
statement regarding the treatment of
the Stanford branch.
"The Senator left his relatives $100.
000 each and I think that as a return
compliment Mrs. Stanford should have
left something to the Stanfords. I
think so; everybody thinks so. And if
she was all that Dr. Jordan paints her,
that is all the more reason why she
should have remembered the members
of the family into which she married.
"I have always had reasonably close
relations with Mrs. Stanford and at no
time have I ever had a quarrel with
her or become estranged from her. I
cannot tell you whether I expected a
bequest or not. The fact remains that
I didn't get it. She left money *to
Chinese, bootblacks and all, but re
membered not one of the Stanfords.
"I wish you would deny interviews
that have been printed about myself
or my wife, particularly with refer
ence to any statement concerning Ice
land Lathrop. Whether Jie intends to
make a contest or not is his own af
fair and we have at no time questioned
him upon the subject nor shall we. He
is Senator Stanford's nephew and the

POLICE ARE VERY BUSY
Miss Richmond Re-examined
"I do not know who opened the Poland water that Mrs. Stanford
drank on January 14." â Former statement made by Elizabeth Richmond.
"I had the butler open the Polnnd water that Mrs. Stanford drank
on January 14. It was my custom to carry mineral water to her room
every night. " â Statement made by Sliss Richmond yesterday In the pres
ence of Captain Burnett, Detective Wren, Detective Cleary, District Actor- ,
ney Byinjrton and Attorney Mountford Wilson.
Several stories told by Miss Richmond in regard to the poiaonimr on
January 14 differ in many essential particular*. Captain Burnett haa or
dered her to report to him again at 4 o'clock to-day, when she will be
questioned further.
At one time the former maid of Mrs. Stanford said that she had
brought an emetic to her mistress on the evening of January 14. Yester-
day she maintained that Mrs. Stanford vomited the poison before she
(the maid) entered the room.
One thing fixed to a certainty by Miss Richmond's testimony of yes
terday Is that the first attempt at poisoning was made by some one very
close to Mrs. Stanford.
The poisoned Poland water that
nearly ended the life of Mrs. Stanford
on January 14 was prepared some time
between 6:30 p. m. ot the 13th and
6:30 p. m. of the 14th. This fact
is fixed by the testimony given in Cap
tain Burnett's office yesterday by Eliz
abeth Richmond, the former maid of
the dead philanthropist.
The water was poisoned by some
member of the household â that point
is implied from her statement. At
10 a. m. of January 14 Miss Rich
mond saw on Mrs. Stanfords wash
stand a bottle of Poland water from
which a large quantity had been drunk.
At 6:30 p. m. Miss Richmond carried up
another bottle of Poland water. Then
she noticed that the bottle which had
been nearly empty in the morning was
almost full.
It was from this bottle â the one that
had stood in the room from 6:30 p. m
of the 13th to 6:30 p. m. of the
14th â that Mrs. Stanford drank.
It was a draught from this bottle that
poisoned her, as an analysis from
Wakelee's drug: store afterward proved.

him as various witnesses told their
stories. The jurymen, in the
graceful neglige of the tropics, sat
about the inner room in attitudes
suggestive rather of personal de
sire for their comfort than of any
oecp sense of gravity of the <hny
that called them there.
The inquest began with the ex
amination of Miss Berner, who
had been the secretary, companion
and, it is whispered now, spir
itualistic medium of Mrs. Stan
ford, and who had prepared for
her the fatal dose of bicarbonate
of soda which, it has been said,
caused her death. There is, of
course, no suspicion that Miss
Berner knew there was poison in
the bottle. Her preparation of the
dose, from her own evidence and
from all attending circumstances,
was innocent enough. She told
her story in a level, even voice, be
traying no excitement beyond a
strained attention to detail which
caused her to weigh carefully
every answer that she made to
every question, even the most'
trivial. She listened with grave
attention to each question that was
pal to her and returned no answer
until she was very sure that the
Deputy Sheriff had completed his
query, and she volunteered noth
ing. If she had been schooled for
â¢he stand she could not have
done better, and there can be no
'iiiestion that she has schooled her-
self carefully during the time
that has elapsed since the death
of her patroness. Miss Berner had
not left her own room until to
day since the tragedy occurred.
She is well on to middle lifeâ
who might have been called
to meet many grave crises before
one confronted her and who
old know how to prepare to
meet them. She wore a dress to
day all white, with openwork
t. the sleeves long and full,
the collar fitting closely. Her gray
hair was combed in a rather wide
pompadour, and she held her
somewhat long and thin white
hands, upon which shone several
rich rings, clasped closely together
in her lap while she talked."
Following Miss Berner. the
afternoon session closed with the
examination of Drs. Day and
Wood.

to a case of strychnine poisoning, was
bi-gun this afternoon at tlie Moano Ho
tel, where Mrs. Stanford died.
The evidence of the doctors was of
vital importance and was heard with
deep inte:
Dr. C. B. Wood, one of the physicians
who conducted the autopsy, testified
that the yymptoms found by him and:
the other physicians were indicative
of strychnine poisoning, which was the
cause of death. The bpdy had the ap
pearance of that of a woman of 65
years of age â one whp enjoyed good
health. No other cause of death eV
cept that indicated could be discovered
by the physicians.
The body, Dr. Wood said, was first
examined for external causes of death,
Lut without result, and then for exter
nal appearances, for the reason that
the physicians had been informed that
there was suspicion of poisoning by
the administration of strychnine.
I XL SI AL RIGIDITY FOUND.
One symptom of such poisoning, the
doctor said, is unusual rigidity. Mrs.
Stanford's mouth was rigid and the
u-eth were locked. The neck was not
rigid, and the muscles of the upper
arm were relaxed. This would not be
expected in a case resulting from
strychnine poisoning, but the doctors
were intormed that the undertaker had
broker, up the rigidity of the body so
as to put a gown on it.
Th*- firearms. Dr. Wood said, were
ripiu to a marked degree, and also the
thighs and legs. The appearance of
the feet, according to the witness,
would indicate strychnine poisoning.
Tht Inatep was arched, the feet turned
in and drawn up at the toes.
Mr?. Stanford's body. Dr. Wood said,
was the color of violet or purple. He
said that he had examined all the or
gans and had turned over to Dr. R. A.
Duncan, Food Commissioner and
Chemical Analyst of the Board of
Health, the contents of the stomach.
The left side of the heart was found to
be contracted, while the right side was
relaxed. On the left side he found one
and a half teaspoonfuls of dark blood,
while the rijht side of the heart was
nearly empty and without clots.
The post-mortem appearances in
known cases of strychnine poisoning,
the witness said, corresponded with
those found in the autopsy. The ex
amination of the different organs fail
ed to show any sufficient cause of
death due to disease.
STI;V(HMXE CAUSED DEATH.
In reply to a question by Deputy
High .Sheriff Rawlins, Dr. Wood said
that the post-mortem appearances, as
far as post-mortem signs go, indicated
strychnine poisoning.
Dr. F. R. Day, another of the phy
sicians who conducted the autopsy,
agreed with Dr. Wood that strychnine
poisoning was the only cause of death
indicated.
The first witness examined by the
Coroner's jury was Miss Bertha Ber
ner. who had been Mrs. Stanford's
secretary for the last twenty years,
and who came to Honolulu with her
on the Pacific Mail Company's steam
er Korea from San Francisco.
Miss Berner. who was examined by
Deputy High Sheriff Rawlins, after
she had made preliminary statements
regarding her relations with Mrs.
Stanford, testified that che latter had
left San Francisco on the advice of
her brother, her physician and her at
torney, who had told her it was not
advisable to remain in the latter city.
Miss Berner testified that Mrs. Stan
ford said to tier:
"If I am not to stay in my San
Francisco home, and as the wet sea
son is coming on, rendering it inad
visable for me to go to my country
residence, I prefer to go to Honolulu,
as it is warmer there."
Miss Berner continued:
"The occasion which compelled
Mrs. Stanford to seek advice on this
question val the occurrence of Janu
ary 14, when she drank mineral water
at her California residence and found
it bitter to the taste. This water was
afterward examined by a chemist
who reported that it contained strych
nine, I saw the written report made
by the chemist at the time.
MRS. STANFORD SAD.
"On the steamer coming to Hono
lulu Mrs. Stanford appeared to be sad
and troubled in her mind, but after
her arrival here she recovered her
spirits and took numerous drives,
which she appeared to greatly en-
Joy."
The witness here described a drive
taken by Mrs. Stanford to a picnic on
the day of her death, the facts of
which have been already referred to
in these dispatches. She said that
Mrs. Stanford seemed very bright,
that she sang a little song and told
the driver to proceed slowly so as to
make the drive last as long as pos
sible.
At this stage of the examination Misu
Berner showed signs of breaking down.
She recovered, however, and described
the luncheon of which Mrs. Stanford
partook at the picnic.
This luncheon lasted from 1 o'clock
until half-past 1, after which the lit
tle party started on its return to Hono
lulu. The carriage stopped at a store,
where orders were given regarding a
costume for Mrs. Stanford, and the
party arrived at the Moano Hotel at 4
o'clock. Â»

day's outing."
ATr SOl'P ONLY.
Mist* Berner repeated the statement
already made to the Associated Press
pondent and mentioned in these
dispatches that when the soup was
served Mrs. Stanford told the waiter it
would be sufficient, as she was not
hungry, having lunched heartily.
After retiring to her room Mrs. Stan
ford asked Miss Berner to prepare her
medicine, and the witness first placed
on the table a glass of the mineral
water desired by her employer and aft
rt placed half a teaspoonful of
bicarbonate of soda and" one laxative

Mrs. Stanford for the night. This was

grill for nearly an hour and subjected
to relentless questioning.
BEVERLY IS FLUSHED.
After the "sweating" the ex-butler
and the pale little maid hurried out of
the Hall of Justice and down Kearny
street. Beverly was flushed and
nervous, and Miss Richmond was pale
as death. The pair have promised to
report at police headquarters to-day,
when they will again be questioned.
The ex-butler and ex-maid were pho
tographed by the prison photographer.
When asked the reason of this action.
Captain Burnett said, "We may want
the photographs for reference."
Following is Miss Richmond's story
in full:
It has always been customary for Mrs. Stan
ford to have a bottle of Poland water or a
bottle of tome other still mineral water in her
room to drink at her pleasure. She generally
drank a class of water about an hour before
lunch and another about one hour before dln
n-er. It was alway* my duty and my custrwn
to see that a bottle of water waa In readiness
for her whenever she wanted It. Sometimes
ehe drank one kind of water and sometimes
she drank another. In this instance, for a
change, she wanted a case of Poland water
and It wag therefore ordered and placed in the
butler's pantry.
As I said before, I always attended to tak
ing^up the water to Mrs. Stanford's room. On
Friday night, January 13 â the night preceding
the poisonln; â I went to the butler's pantry
and the butler took two bottle? from the case
nnd pulled out the corks, putting each cork
partly back again. 1 then placed one bottle
nn the stairway for Xora to take up to Miss
Kerner's room and I carried the other bottle
Into Mrs. Stanford's room and put It in the
customary place on the washstand. I noticed
as I did bo that the bottle which I had pre
viously placed there had been partially emp
tied. Thta -was about 6:30 In the evening. The
next morning, which was Saturday, some
ner, "was the week after New Year's.
I used it at the same time. The bottle
was in a trunk which Mrs. Stanford
took to San Jose. This trunk was sent
to San Francisco on January 23. The
bottle was taken from the trunk at the
California-street residence. It was
kept in a room to which the servants
had access, but this room was locked
at night. The bottle was packed by
me in a telescope basket for the Hono
lulu trip, and this basket wag kept in
the stateroom. May Hunt, the maid,
was with Mrs. Stanford Dart of the
way, but as the maid was taken 111 I
changed places with her. The bicar
bonate of soda was not used on the
trip to my knowledge.
CAIJLED FOR HELP.
"After Mrs. Stanford retired on Feb
ruary 28 I was aroused from my sleep
by hearing my name called. I recog
nized Mr 6. Stanford's voice calling out:
"Bertha â Mayâ l am so sick.'
"We rushed out and found her
clinging to the frame of her door. Mrs.
Stanford said:
" 'Bertha, run for a doctor.'
"Mrs. Stanford walked two steps
and then said:
" 'Bertha, I am so sick.'
"She placed her arm around my
shoulders, leaning on me, and I led
her back to her room and tried to in
duce her to sit down. She said: 'I
have got no control of my body. I
think I am poisoned.'
"I said to Mrs. Stanford: 'Do sit
down,' and then I got hot water and
filled a glass and held it to her lips.
She said:
" 'I cannot drink.'
"Her Jaws were set. She turned her
face to mine and I said, 'Now, try to
drink,' and then she drank the hot
water. May Hunt and I were rubbing
Mrs. Stanford's limbs when the doc
tor arrived. She had taken altogether
about six or seven glasses of the hot
water -when Dr. Humphris came. She
said to the doctor:
RECALLS FORMER ATTEMPT.
" 'Doctor, I think I am poisonedl
Won't you brings a stomach pump?'
Then turning to me she said: "Bertha,
tell the doctor what happened,' refer
ring to the San Francisco episode of
January 14.
'I explained this affair to Dr. Hum
ph ris and asked him for ipecac. He
said that ipecac might affect the heart,
and tried to comfort Mrs. Stanford,
saying to her, 'Don't be afraid.' She
said, 'Another spasm is coming,' and
then! 'My soul is prepared. I go to
meet my dear ones. O God, forgive
me my sins.'
"The muscles became rigid. Then
there came a profuse perspiration, fol
lowed by a violent spasm, and Mrs.
Stanford died."
Attorney General Andrews ques
tioned Miss Berner regarding the bot
tlo of bicarbonate of soda. The wit
ness said It was Mrs. Stanford's cus
tom to take the soda only occasionally,
aud added:
"No one knew of this custom, so far
a* I am aware, but myself, May Hunt
and Nora Hopkins, an employe at the
San Francisco residence of Mrs. Stan
ford."
Questioned by Deputy High Sheriff
Kawlins with regard tft the possibility
of Mrs. Stanford having committed
suicide, Miss Berner expressed pity for
any one who could be driven to such,
a conclusion. "I have not read the
newspaper reports of the case," said
she, "because they would distress me.
Mrs. Stanford," she said in conclusion,
"on a few occasions said she hoped
some day to rejoin her son and her
husband, to whose memory she was
always devoted, but this was not a
frequent toDic of conversation with
her."
Dr. Murray described the body as
more like that of a woman of 65 years
than 77. Every organ of the body was
normal on examination. No disease
existed, but the heart was a little fatty.
The left Bide of the heart was, contract
ed, the right side relaxed. The brain
was in perfect condition and she was
a wonderfully preserved woman. There
was nothing to indicate natural death.
When he first saw the body he at once
concluded that she had been poisoned
and his opinion was immediately form
ed that she had been poisoned by
strychnine.
Dr. H. V. Murray and Dr. F. H.
Humphris substantially the
rm(> as the other physicians. Dr.
Murray expressed an absolute opinion
that strychnin caused death, which
he was convinced was an unnatural
one. There was, he said, an absence
of food in the stomach.
Dr. Humphris said that Mrs. Stan- ,
where about 10 o'clock, I waa in Mrs. Stan
ford's room and 1 noticed that the partially
filled botile of the night before had been re
moved and that a quantity had been drunk
from the bottle I had placed there Friday
Mrs. Stanford spent nearly all Saturday
downstairs and I do not think drank any of
the .Poland water from that bottle during that
day. Saturday night at 0:80, as wÂ»Â» my usual
custom, I took up a bottle from the buuer s
pantry and placed It beside the bottle t|iut I
had taken up the previous ovenlng. This '""Â«>"
bottle was, I think, nearly or partially filled
and it was from this bottle, which had been
standing In her room all day, tjiat airs.
Stanford drank that night and which nas
since, by "Wakelee's report, proved to hayÂ»
had strychnine la It.
WATER WAS BITTER.
At 9 o'clock Saturday Mrs. Stanford came
ruÃhlng to -the sewing-room adjoining, where
I waa sitting, and called: "Richmond, Rich
mond, come and see what Is the matter with
the Poland water. I drank some and it nearly
choked me. It burned me so that I ran my
fingers down my throat and threw It all up.
Mrs. Stanford was greatly excited. I ran
across the room and poured some of the water
into the glasa, and as I was doing 90 Mrs.
Stanford cried out, "Taste It, Richmond,
taste it." I took a mouthful, and it was so
bitter I at once spat it out. I then ran up
to Mies Berner' s room. She was in bed. I
told her of what had happened, and she
Jumped out of bed and together we ran to
Mrs Stanford's room. Mrs. Stanford said:
"Taste the Poland water, Bertha; something
is the matter with It."
Misa Berner put it to her lips and said:
"Oh, It is bitter! What Is the matter with
it?" I then said, "Mrs. Stanford, you drank
some of the water out of the bottle this morn
ing, ac I noticed some was gone .when I
came in the room at. 10 o'clock." Mrs. Stan
ford replied: "No, I did not drink any Poland
water to-day. The first I drank was Just a
few minutes ago."
We all looked In amazement at one an
other. Tbat bottle of Poland water was in
â Mrs. Stanford's room wit hthe cork partially
removed ao any one could remove It, from
Friday night at ti:3o until 9 o'clock Satur
day nieht, when Mre. Stanford drank It.
Those are the facts of the case.
ford's mind was clear when he first
treated her. He confirmed Miss Ber
ner's statements regarding the final
scene and said that at the last ap
proaching spasm Mrs. Stanford said:
"What a horrible death to die!"
She never breathed again. Dr. Hum
nhris expressed his opinion on the spot
that death was caused by strychnine
and he said that he still held the same
view. He had no doubt that it was a
case of strychnine poisoning. He wit
nessed the autopsy and agreed with the
other physicians in their conclusion
that death was caused by strychnine.
May Hunt. Mrs. Stanford's maid,
testified practically the same as Miss
Berner. In addition, she said that
Mrs. Stanford had intended to go to
Japan. In one conversation with Mrs.
Stanford she discussed the subject of
the alleged attempt to poison her in
San Francisco. Mrs. Stanford said:
"How dreadful if I had died that
time. People might have thought I
committed suicide."
At to-morrow's session of the in
quest the chemists who made the an
alysis of Mrs. Stanford's stomach and
other organs will testify.
The inquest was adjourned at 7:80
p. m. It is expected that the chemists
will give their testimony to-morrow.
NEWSBOYS MOURN BENEFACTOR
Mrs. Stanford's Death Causes Grief
Among Street Gamins.
That Mrs. Jane Lathrop Stanford's
tragic death is mourned by people in
all walks of life is shown by the sor
row felt by the newsboys. Every
Christmas she guve a dinner to hun
dreds of little ragged gamins. The grief
of her friends in higher walks of life
and the sorrow of the students of the
Stanford University is sincere, but not
a bit more sincere than the grief of
these little proteges of the philan
thropic woman.
"She always thought of us. It
ain't losing: no dinner that makes us
sorry," said one of the boys who had
known of her bounty, "but she did
not forget us. That's a whole lot.
There's millionaires and millionaires,
but sho was an angel, she wa?."
The street gamins have no halls or
temples to hold memorial services in.
But among themselves they say, "She
did not forget us; we do not forget
her." This is as high a tribute as
they can pay.
Old Tricks Played Over Again.
The irresponsible youths who worry
the life out of their employers have
added another trick to their stock of
accomplishments for relieving the
tedium of toll by taking advantage of
the inherent curiosity which forms so
large a part of the average American's
makeup. In the downtown section
there are usually many large buildings
in course of erection. Before one of
these two or three of the aforesaid irre
sponsible youths will gather and silent
ly gaze skyward toward the workmen
on the top story. After a minute or
two of this, there has formed a small
crowd, none knowing just why the
others have stopped there, each watch
ing intently for some development at
the top of the building. And then,
after much solemnity, the ringleader
of the tro-Ã¼ble makers will turn to his
accomplices asd ejaculate, "Stung
again!" A method more in favor when
time presses is to stop suddenly, gaze
upward and utter fervently a long
drawn "O-o-o!" Invariably half a
dozen 0? the passersby will stop,
us^uUly with one or two collisions, and
stare skyward, whereat the leader will
mutter "My â what rubbernecks!" to
the intense discomfiture of the men,
who realize that they ha*e been duped,
and hurry on with imprecations. â New

LELAND LATHROP CONTENT.
Quite different in expression is Le
j land Lathrop. He is the son of Charles
G. Lathrop and like all the nephews
and nieces shared in the will of Sen
ator Stanford, receiving $100,000. This,
he says, he is satisfied with and in re
sponse to the question whether he
would contest the will said, "I feel, and
our family feels, that Senator Stanford
.generously provided for us and we
have always understood that the
money left by him to Mrs. Stanford
was her own. We have regarded it as
hers to do with as she liked."
"I personally feel no chagrin nor dis
satisfaction over the fact that I w,as
not remembered. I have always been
very friendly with Mrs. Stanford, but
there were other members of the fam
ily who were even closer and were not
remembered.
"Senator Stanford had a brother in
Australia whom Mrs. Stanford visited
frequently and with whom she was on
friendly terms, and yet no mention is
made of him. She knew him better
than any other member of the Stan
ford branch of the family, with the
possible exception of Josiah Stanford,
to whose son, her nephew, she failed
to leave anything.
"That any one should be dissatisfied
with the will seems to me to be a trifle
ungrateful, as the Senator generously
remembered all his kin. As to Mrs.
Stanford, I suppose she thought â of
course, I don't know positively what
she thought â but I have reason to be
lieve that she thought the generous
provision made by Senator Stanford
for nephews ajnd nieces was ample.
"When Senator Stanford died he left
$1,000,000 to each of his three brothers
in-law, Charles G. Lathrop, Ariel La
throp and Daniel Lathrop, now de
ceased. The income of the million left
to Daniel Lathrop was evenly appor
tioned between his three daughters,
Mrs. George P. Lawton, Mrs. Amy
Hanson and Mrs. Christine Gunning,
now deceased. The two children of
Mrs. Gunning draw the income of one
third of the million left to their grand
father, Daniel Lathrop, by Senator
Stanford."
Mrs. E. R. Taylor, nee Stanford, a
daughter of Josiah Stanford and sister
of Josiah Stanford Jr., does not share
in the dissatisfaction expressed by her
cousin, Jerome Stanford. To her was
left $150,000 at the death of Senator
Stanford, and is perfectly satisfied with
that. She declared positively last night
that she would not contest the will.

School, and an eminent attorney.
SAY THEY BORE NO ILL WILL.
Ex-Butler and Former Maid Stoutly
Assert Their Innocence.
SAN MATEO. March 6.â According
to accounts, Miss Richmond, who was
Mrs. Stanford's maid at the time of the
first poisoning in San Francisco, and
who left her service shortly after, has
been connected with the best families
of both continents.
She came to California with excel
lent references, for Mrs. Stanford was
very particular as to whom she took
into her employ. For a long time Miss
Richmond lived in England and there
served the nobility. Then she came to
America, and not being of a very
rcbust nature she sought the mild
climate of California.
Albert Beverly, Mrs. Stanford's old
butler, first came to the coast with
Lily Langtry, having charge of her
private car. Mrs. Beverly was also
in the service of this famous actress.
Their last service was with Mrs. Stan
lord. The pretty little cottage of the
Beverlys on the outskirts of San
Mateo is a scene of great unrest and
anxiety. Mr. and Mrs. Beverly and
Miss Richmond, who is living with
them, have all the time plainly asserted
their innocence of even harboring any
ill will toward Mrs. Stanford, but the
knowledge that they are being con
stantly watched weighs heavily on
them. All show in their drawn faces
the loss of Bleep and the want of
appetite.
Down at the Berner house just back
of the Stanford stock farm Mrs. Ber
ner, the aged mother of Mrs. Stanford's
secretary, lies very ill with nervous
collapse. She is 75 years old, and the
thought of her daughter so far away
and in trouble has completely un
nerved her. She has a terrible fear
that Miss Berner herself may be the
victim of poisoning before she returns
to her Palo Alto home.

on motion of Supervisor Eggers, who

DETECTIVES
TRY TO HIDE
EACH MOVE
Are Silent Concerning Strychnine
Found in Not] Hill Mansion,
Police Doing Their Utmost to Conceal Fact
That They Hold an Important Clew
to the Murder.
The detectives still refuse to give out
any information concerning the bottle
of strychnine they found in Mr 9. Stan
ford's residence. In fact, they are do
ing their utmost to discredit the story
that was published exclusively in The
Call as to the finding of the poison, the
purpose evidently being to conduct
this phase of their investigations in ab
solute secrecy.
The discovery of the strychnine bot
tle in Mrs. Stanford's own home may
have the greatest bearing on the mys
tery and for this reason, it Is asserted,
the utmost secrecy must be maintained
that the important clew might not be
spoiled. The finding of this poison
had much to do with the decision to
send Detectives Callundan and Rey
nolds to Honolulu.
It is understood, however, that no"
person has been connected with the
purchase of the poisonous crystals. If
so, the bottle is without a label show
ing from what store it came. This
would be very likely, for the poisoner
would at least take the precaution to
remove the label, even though bung
ling method was shown in trying to
hide It. Those who have been In Mrs.
Stanford's employ at the Nob Hill
mansion deny that she ever kept any
strychnine.
"There are no rats or mice there."
explained fqrmer Butler MacWhinney
yesterday, "and there was never any
occasion to use poison in the house.
XEAV SEAL FOR INDIANA
RADICAL CHANGE FROM OLD
Ladies Took Charge of. Matter and
Got Up Design to Harmonize
With Real Conditions.
Indiana has a new State seal. It is
a beautiful feminine affair with the
man on the original seal replaced by
female figures and with several other
improvements which bring it thorough
ly up to date. The State has not yet
accepted it, and it is said that it may
not until it goes in for woman suffrage,
but the seal will be ready .when that
times comes.
In the meantime It heads the fine let
ter paper on which the Daughters of
Indiana in New York write their epis
tles. The Daughters are members of
an organization which has just been
formed nnd which held its first social
meeting at the Hotel Astor recently.
It was ftiere that the de?lgn of
the seal made its appearance and was
regularly adopted by the Daughters as
the insignia of their organization.
A seal is one of the first essentials of
such a society, and Miss Susan Ketch
urn, an artist and second vice j resi
dent, was chosen to improve upon the
State design. She did this with such
success that the society gave the artist
a hearty vote of thanks.
The present Indiana seal has a group
of mountains outlined against a rising
sun with a buffalo at the foot of the
mountains on the left, with trees and
a wood chopper on the right. In the
new seal the mountains have been low
ered half their height, the buffalo has
disappeared, so has the wood chopper,
and three female figures appear in his
place. m â
"I have lived in Indiana all my life,
said Miss Ketchum, explaining her
changes, "and I have never seen any
mountains there, so in their place I
have put hills. The buffalo lying at
their feet I have left out entirely. There
are no buffaloes in Indiana, and the
buffalo is practically extinct, anyway,
and quite out of place. We do not even
have a woodman sparing a tree in our
seal, but a wood chopper. "We have
no trees to spare in Indiana, so I have
taken the man out altogether and in
his place I have put two ladies and a
little girl."â Exchange.
PLANS FOR EXPEDITING
CUSTOMS APPEALS CASES
Secretary Shaw Complains of Need

Decision In Importers' Cases.
Leslie M. Shaw, Secretary of th
Treasury, who has been Interested i
a more expeditious disposal of cus

has succeeded hi reaching an under

Attorney Burnett with a view to clear
ing the court calendars here.
Mr. Shaw nan held the opinion eve
since he took his present office tha
appeals of importers from decisions o
the Board of General Appraisers wer
unduly delayed by attorneys for the
personal gain. It is claimed by th
Secretary that lawyers delay the pros
ecutlon of issues as long aa possib
in order that similar protests may ac
cumulate before the lower custom
tribunals.
In Instances where the test case
decided in favor of the importers' con

lawyers is larger than when the \m\i

â¢None of us ever saw the strychnin*.
Of course, Mrs. Stanford might pos
sibly have kept the poison without my
knowing it."
The protfa-bmties favor the theory
that Mrs. Stanford had no strychnine
in her home, and that some servant
purchased it. It is further to bÂ« as
sumed with good reason that thÂ«
poison which caused death came from
this bottle.
The attitude of the detectives being
so strict as to silence, it is impossible
to gain any detailed information in re
gard to the bottle. They have the bot
tle In their possession and as they arÂ«
successfully guarding their secret
everything for the public at this timt
must be left to conjecture.
Captain Callundaji of thÂ« Morse
agency is credited with the possession
of the strychnine bottle, and there is
remote possibility that he took it with
him to Honolulu to produce at the in
quest which he expected, would be de
layed until his arrival there. Mean
time the search of the drug stores goes
on quietly in the hope that the great
missing link in the mystery, that of the
Identity of the person who bought the
poison, can be discovered.

that they have found a bottle of

them to pursue, yet there is much

Session Ends Abruptly When
Second Witness Takes the
Stand and Prisoner Faints
CLEVELAND, 0., March 6.â A
complete nervous collapse by Mrs.
Cassie L. Chadwick brought the first
day of her trial to an abrupt close this
afternoon.
F. H. Haller of Oberlin, the second
â¢witness called by the State, was on
the stand and had answered but two
questions when Mrs. Chadwick, who
was very pale, whispered to her attur
fjey that she would be compelled tcr
cave the room. She passed out quickly
and on reaching the anteroom sank
into a chair in a faint.
Two trained nurses who were in the
courtroom were hastily summoned and
in a few moments Mrs. I'hatiwick \v;is
revived. She was in no condition to
return to the courtroom, however, and
Judge Tayler adjourned tne trial until
to-morrov/ morning. It was an excit
ing day for Mrs. Chadwick and she
took the keenest interest in all the pro
ceedings. Seated close oeslde her at
torneys, she scanned the face of every
Juror summoned and frequently ex
pressed her opinion of them to her
lawyers. In the afternoon, when Dis
trict Attorney Sullivan outlined the
case he expected to prove against her,
Mrs. Chadwick's eyes did not leave his
face for a second. When her counsel.
J. P. Dawley, rose to state her side of
the case, her face brightened and she
followed him as eagerly as she had
listened to Mr. Sullivan, and apparently
with more pleasure.
The trial made rapid progress to-day.
The jury was accepted within two
hours and this afternoon the opposing
counsel outlined their cases and the
taking of testimony was commenced.
Twenty-eight witnesses have been sub
poenaed by the Government and as far
as can be ascertained none has been
summoned by the defense.
The attorneys for Mrs. Chadwick are
confident that the Government will be
unable to prove its case.
Shorn of its legal phraseology the
charge upon which Mrs. Chadwick is
arraigned is conspiracy against the
law? of the United Statesâ the con
spiracy as defined by the Government
resting in the agreement between her
and the officials of the Citizens' Na
tional Bank of Oberlin. Ohio, to issue
and negotiate certified checks when she
had no money in the bank.
DEMENTED BOY
SLAYS MOTHER
-Mortally Wounds Father
at the Home of Parents
in a New Jersey Town
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, March 6. â Richard
Wakeman, twenty-one years old, the
demented son of John and Augusta
Wakeman of Bloomfield avenue, Glen
ridge. N. J., attacked his parents this
afternoon. His mother died in Moun
tainside Hospital, where his father
lies, probably mortally hurt.
The young man first attacked his
mother with a hatchet, cutting her
head, and then went into the base
ment, where he drew a revolver and
fired at his father. One bullet lodged
in the fathers head above the left
eye, the second close to the heart and
the third imbedded itself in the back
of his head. The boy was in the act
of firing a fourth bullet, when the
father, who is a cripple, raised his
< run h and struck his son on the wrist
In an attempt to knock the revolver
out of his hand, but in so doing broke
The crutch.
Prior to attacking his father the
young man. who had been in the rear
yard, entered the house and asked his
father where his mother was.
"She is up stairs," said the father.
"She is not feeling very well and is
resting."
Richard then went up the stairs
leading from the basement to the
<i flooi- and walking into the
room seized a hatchet which he had
hidden behind a door and struck his
mother two violent blows on the head.
Her cries attracted her husband, but
before he could get up the stairs the
maniac had met him and fired the
6hots.
Mr. Wakeman called for help and
his cries were responded to by Percy
Jacobus, a neighbor. When Jacobus
entered the house Wakeman stood at
the foot of the stairs. In the mean
time the son had left the house and
in a few minutes Wakeman, despite
his injuries, had crawled up the stairs
and was beside his dying wife.
At the approach of Jacobus the
maniac fired a shot from his revolver
at him, the bullet just missing his
head. Jacobus, fearing death, ran
down the street in search of a police
man.
Wakeman and his wife, who was
Augusta Wakeman before her marri
age, were cousins. The son was born
with brain trouble.

BIERCE'S WIFE
GETS DIVORCE
Spouse of the Well-Known
Writer Granted Decree by
the Court in Los Angeles
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, March 6. â Mrs.
Ambrose Bierce, the wife of the well
known newspaper and magazine
wri|er, was granted a divorce in the
Superior Court late this afternoon on
the grounds of desertion and failure
to provide. There was no contest.
Service of the summons was admitted
and the defendant was represented by
counsel, but no evidence other than
that presented by the complainant was
adduced.
The Bierces were married in 1870
and separated in 1891. For nearly
fourteen years they have not lived to
gether and for several years there has
been no communication between them.
Mrs. Bierce has been living in Los An
geles with relatives and Bierce has
been following his newspaper work in
various cities.
The cause of the estrangement was
not brought out in the evidence, but
it is understood that after a son of
the- couple killed a woman and him
self several years ago in Chico no ef
fort to secure a reconciliation was
made. No property interests were con
sidered in the divorce proceedings.
HOMES PLANNED
FOR BACHELORS
Dr. Eastabrook of Massachu
setts Would Make Them
Comfortable in Old Age
Special Dispatch to The Call.
EVERETT, Mass., March 6.â Dr.
Charles E. Estabrook of this city has
evolved a plan for the establishment
of a chain of homes for old bachelors
stretching across the country and has
formed the "Hope Brotherhood" to
carry out his project. He will estab
lish in Everett, a quiot little suburb of
Boston, the initial bachelor's home in
the chain and will call it the "Center
of Rest," which title will be given to
each home as established.
Dr. Estabrook's plan looks to the
uniting of middle-aged and elderly
bachelors of intelligence and refine
ment into a great brotherhood, who,
by their contributions, will help to
provide comforts and even luxuries
for bachelors as they become aged
and more or less helpless, instead of
their having to lead the lonely lives
they do now.
"The plan is wholly humanitarian
in its aim," said Dr. Estabrook to-day,
"social in its acts, but providing
havens of rest for men who have be
come nervous wrecks through the use
of tobacco, morphine or liquor, or
through the hard work and loneliness
they have been compelled to endure."
As the "brotherhood" increases
other "Centers of Rest" will be estab
lished as fast as the growth warrants
It. Able bachelors will be sent to
establish colonies in various places.

batteries immediately opened fire and
forced a cessation of the work.
At dawn yesterday the Japanese at
t.i'ked the Russian positions near

scarcely recognizable as valiant Jap
anese, so mechanically did they move
forward and with undying persistence
attack only to be thrown back. They
repeated this at 10 o'clock in the mqrn
ing after a preparatory artillery bom
bH-dment, and reached the Russian
trenches, where a bayonet fight en
sued. At the crucial moment General
Alieff, commanding the vanguard,
arrived on the scene with two com
panies and turned the scale against the
me**. Among the wounded was
Lieutenant Colonel Hrostitsky of the
peneral staff, who nevertheless re
mained at the front. Toward evening
the fight slackened.
The Japanese employed an ingenious
scheme to deceive the Russian artil
lery, whose shells, though having the
ranges, appeared to be exploding
in the wrong. The officers were about
to resnrt to experimental firing when
skirmishers reported that the Japanese
were exploding small mines and even
throwing dirt In the air with spades to
effect a deception.
ST. PETERSBURG, March 6.â lt
has Just been learned that General
Kuropatkin has launched a blow at
Field Marshal Oyama's left center, Just
east of the railroad. The fighting is
desperate along almost the entire line.
Kuropatkin's losses in killed and
wounded up to last night are placed
at 23.500. Oyama is thought to have
almost 30.000. The Japanese, accord
ing to the prisoners, are greatly ex
hausted. They repeat the statement
that some of General No-gi's men have
nnt had any food for two days.
The result of the greatest battle of
modern times is expected to be deter
mined to-day or to-morrow. Two of
ihe largest armies of recent times,
both in men and guns, are now locked
in a death struggle, and although Gen
eral Kuropatkin has evidently made
every preparation to cover his retreat
by removing his accumulated stores
and munitions northward, it is now the
opinion of military men here that one
side or the other cannot escape an
overwhelming disaster. With both
wings bent backward Kuropatkin's
position appears to be desperate, but
the issue is still in the balance. News.
of a victory for him is only regarded
as possible by his breaking through
the enveloping lines and news of a con
centrated offensive is hourly awaited.
Unless Kuropatkin can strike and
strike hard It is realized that he must
lose.
OYAMA'S STRATEGY.
Field Marshal Oyama's strategy in
this bittle is now clear. He startled
and amazed the War Office by the
marvelous daring of General Kuroki's
advance against the extreme Russian
left and the series of blows delivered
a* the center, wher< no less than thir
teen separate attacks have been
launched by the Imperial Guards ten
miles east of Poutiloff Hill. But it is
now realized that the heavy blows
at the left were intended to mask the
real turning movement, which came
like a bolt from a clear sky out of
the we?t. Kuropatkin fell into the
trap. The situation seemed an exact
duplicate of that at Llaoyang and the
Russian commander in chief hastened
to mass forces at meet Kuroki. Fri
day the whole situation was suddenly
reversed, when with lightning rapidity
the Japanese turning operation began
on the plain between the Hun and
Liao rivers.
In order to succeed Oyama threw
tho neutrality of China to the winds.
General Nogi, with his Port Arthur
veterans, moved up the right bank of
the Hun River and fell like an aval
anche upon the weakened Russian
right, doubling it back in confusion^
the Japanese advance being co-ordi
nated with the advance straight from
the west of a Japanese column of
40.000 men, which circled around or
through Chinese neutral territory. Al
though rumors of the presence of the
latter column westward of Mukden
were circulated as long ago as Tues-

WITH THE JAPANESE LEFT
ARMIES, Thursday. March 2, via
Tientsin, March 6.â The Japanese Jsft
armies are still continuing their ad
vance, despite a heavy snowstorm, and
are attacking Kujp.tsz and Ertaitaz.
The Russian second line of defenses
was captured during the night of
March 1. The attacking and bombard
ing are of a furious nature and the Rus
sians are defending their positions
stubbornly. It is the evident intention
of the Japanese to crush the Russian
right flank along the main line, forc
ing a general withdrawal acroÃS the
Hun River. Now that a foothold has
been secured in the Russian defenses,
it is believed the Japanese can accom
plish their object in a few days.
In the meantime the bombardment
of the center is continued with in
creased vigor. The capture of Huande
this morning wa^ the sensational event
of the battle. So far small detach
ments of Japanese troops sent to
reco-nnoiter the Russian positions ap
proached them under cover of a heavy
snowstorm and suddenly charged, driv
ing a superior force from the trenches
at the point of the bayonet and oc
cupying them.
The village of Chintan, captured on
the night of March 1, is important, as
the piace is the end of the main defen
sive works on the Russian right wing
and gives the Japanese the best pos
sible pivot to swing northward the
army now west of the Hun with the
object of entirely enveloping the Rus
sian right. The Japanese operations
during the night of March I were ex
tremely difficult. The Russian works
were very strongly defended by en
tanglements and many machine guns
and the Russians used searchlights
and star shells, but in spite of these
the Japanese, under cover of a heavy
bombardment, rushed the works at the
point of the bayonet, killing many of
the Russians and imprisoning some in
the trenches.
At Potietz the Japanese captured a
strong redoubt at the foot of a small
hill. Unofficially the Japanese casual
ties are placed at 2000. The Russian
losses are believed to be greater. Dur
ing the operations on the left the Jap
anese center has been heavily bom
barding the Russian positions with
heavy guns, destroying villages and
defensive works.
MACARTHVR AT FRONT.
American General Preparing for Trip
to Battlefield.
TOKIO, March 6.â Major General
Mac Arthur of the United States army,
accompanied by his aid, Captain Par
ker W. West of the Eleventh Cavalry,
and by Captain John J. Pershing of
the Fifteenth Cavalry will leave Tokio
for the front March 9 as military ob
servers with the Japanese armies.
United States Minister Lloyd C. Gris
com is making arrangements for their
departure.
* â â  â : â  â â â -+â 
day, Kuropatkin evidently j was taken
by surprise, possibly refusing to be
lieve that the Japanese would thus
openly fling Chinese neutrality to the
winds. At any rate, it was not until
Saturday night that he 'was able to
shift sufficient reinforcements west to
stem the tide when the Japanese were
within sight of Mukden. '\;<
JAPANESE EXHAUSTED.
The latest advices are to the effect
that the Japanese, exhausted by their
tremendou > efforts, had everywhere
stopped, and now if ever Kuropatkin's
hcur has come. The Japanese lines
are extended over-several miles, while
Kuropatkin's are constantly contract
ing. Besides he has the advantage for
the offensive of operating in the in
terior of his lines.
Military critics declare Oyama has
not got enough superiority to take
ri. c ,ks. According to the "War Office,
Oyama bas not over 70,000 men In ex
cess of Kuropatkin, whose forces total
about 340,000. Should Oyama suc
ceed the critics declare that he will
prove himself to be a master of mili
tary science and establish a reputa
tion for military genius of the first
magnitude. But unless he can com
pletely crush Kuropatkin's right they
say Oyama is in imminent danger of
having hla own left cut off and de
stroyed. Kuropatkin's chance, the
War Office says, is to take the offen
sive, as passive resistance would be
fatal.
NEWCHWANG, March 6.â There is
every Indication that the great Jap
anese movement for the envelopment
of Mukden has so far met with over
whelming success and that the strong
hold of the Russians will prove an
other Sedan.
In the past few days little haa been
heard from the fighting along the
strongly fortified central positions, and
it is believed that the Japanese center
is only required to hold its ground
while the wings stretch far to the
northward for the purpose of encircling
the Russian flanks and threatening the
railway.
General Nogi's Third Army from
Port Arthur has advanced Mar on the
left wing and swept all before It. No
gl's men are reveling in the field work,
which they consider child's play' after
the siege of Port Arthur.
London's Street Cars.
There are in London about 115% miles
of tramways, of which eighty-eight
miles have been purchased by the Lon
don County Council under the pro
visions of the tramway act of 1870.
The remainder, about twenty-seven
and a half miles, are still In the hands
of various tramway companies.
The tramways owned by the Council
on the north side of the Thames (for
ty-eighty miles) are leased to the North
Metropolitan Tramways Company for
a period of fourteen years, expiring in
1910; thoÃe on the south Bide of the
Thames (forty miles) are operated by
the Council itself.
The tramways act of 1870 provides
that the local authority concerned may
purchase compulsorily, after a period
of twenty-one years from the date of
the authorization by Parliament, any
tramways constructed and operated by
private companies. â Consular Reports.

Siberian Sharpshooters
Make Brilliant Defense
MUKDEN, Sunday, March 5.â A cor
respondent has just returned from
spending the entire day, March 4, with
the Russian vanguard on the right
flank, where General Nogi is attacking
desperately and especially at Niach
piau, where there is a crossing of the
Hun River, four miles below the rail
road. He says all the Japanese attacks
on March 4 were repulsed, but only
owing to the most heroic fighting,
which was renewed this morning. Tha
vast plain of the Liao and Hun River
valleys presented a brilliant panor
amic scene. The day being clear and
sunny the movement on both sides was
distinctly visible except when clouds of
yellow dust raised by the west wind
swirled down and hid the shifting lines
of infantry.
Charge followed charge, attack, re
pulse and counter-attack, Russians and
Japanese fighting viciously for every
foot of ground and clinging like grim
death itself to every Chinese cottage
and mud wall, the only covers in the
rich bottom land. Every village was
the scene of struggles rivaling the fa
mous La Haye Sainte at Waterloo.
One regiment of Siberian sharpshooters
was led to the attack by Colonel Kou
korin, who was wounded in the foot
February 28, and directed the opera
tions from a litter.
The villages of Sahouda, Yapu and
Lanshanpu were taken and retaken
several times, Lanshanpu finally pass
ing into the hands of the Japanese
March 4. The Japanese used hand
grenades emitting a suffocating gas.
From the front and leffflank the re
ports are of an encouraging nature. A
desperate attack of the Japanese to
day on Poutiloff Hill resulted moat
tragically to them, the Russian artil
lery turning lines of Japanese into
heaps of bleeding bodies, which the
survivors quickly converted into
breastworks, from which they were
driven by a bayonet charge and the
murderous fire of the artillery. The
attack of the Japanese Imperial
Guards' division, according to reports
from General Zassalitch, crumbled be
fore the brilliant defense of the Siber
ian sharpshooters.
On the left General Linevitch holds
the hills stubbornly. It is even said
that he has made a counter-attack and
has retaken some redoubts and has
advanced a few miles.
FAITH IN OYAMA.
Japanose Believe Marshal Will Defeat
Kuropatkin.
TOKIO, March 7, 10 a. m.â All Japan
is eagerly watching developments at
the great theater of war in Manchuria.
The people are confident that Field
Marshal Oyama will defeat General
Kuropatkin. The only Question consid
ered is the extent and severity of the
blow that he will inflict and its effect
upon the course of the war.
It is believed that the possession of
Mukden and a line on the Hun River
are already assured and many predict
even a fcrreater disaster for the Rus
sians. General Kuropatkin seems to
be devoting his greatest energy to the
protection of Fushun in order to pre
serve a line of retreat. He has sent
masses of reserves there. The posi
tions east and south of Fushun have
already been the scenes of the most
bloody fighting. The operations of the
Japanese left and part of the center
continue to be successful.
It is believed that the Japanese will
succeed in cutting the railway north
of Mukden.
Various estimates of the losses al
ready sustained by the opposing forces
are being made. One Tokio newspaper
places the Russian loss at 25,000 and
the Japanese at 10,000. The estimates
are unreliable on account of the mea
gerness of the information at hand.
The Japanese spoils of war promise
to be heavy.
MEN IN FINE SPIRITS.
Russians Undaunted by Death and
Suffering.
MUKDEN, Sunday, March 5. â An
official report in the Army Messenger
Bays:
"The southern position is unchanged
so far as Shakhe."
After acknowledging that the cen
tra! army has fallen back from Sinch
inpu, in order to contract the length of
the line of battle connecting the inner
positions, the Messenger says:
"The spirit 3of the men are excel
lent. Marvelous composure is being
displayed, considering the approaching
crisis."
The paper admits the Russian losses
pre heavy, but says the battle is going
on successfully. All the roads leading
from Manchiapu and the western plain
which has suddenly been Invaded by
the battle are crowded with Chinese
refugees.
Opposite Poutllofl Hill the Russians
arr reported to have captured two ma
chine guns. r
CAPTURE JAPANESE.
Russians Make Prisoners of 100
Brown Men.
MUKDEN, March 6, 4:45 a. m.â The
Russians in their attack March 6, east
ward of Poutiloff Hill, captured about
100 Japanese prisoners. Eastward the
Japanese have continued their at
tacks on the Kandolisan* positions, but
the forces previously attacking Gaotu
Pass have withdrawn southward. The
Japanese attacks March 5 were every
where repulsed. The fiercest fighting
was on the right wing, extending from
Machiapu to Nueslntun. The artillery
duel continued all day throughout the
zone, stretching: from Salingpu to Lu
guantaln.
RUSBIAXS SANGUINE.
Ku r opal kin Satisfied With Conditions
at Mukden.
ST. PETERSBURG, March 6.âGen
eral Kuropatkin, in a dispatch from
the front, dated March 5, says:
"The situation at the Mukden front
remains Quiet. On the left flank, on
the right bank of the Hun River, near
Machiapu, the Japanese have resumed
the offensive energetically. Two at
tacks were repulsed.
"The battle continues successfully
northward of Machiapu. All are show
ing the greatest bravery. In the cen
ter our positions on the Shakhe River,
so far as Shahpao, are retained. Night
attacks on Poutiloff and Novgorod
hills were beaten off. We counter
attacked this morning and captured
two machine guns. In the Erdagon re
gion the enemy is also bombarding our
positions.
"The Japanese during the night at
tacked Kandolizan. All the assaults
were repulsed. An attack on Gaotu
Pass at 11 o'clock last night was beat
en off. The night was quiet in the ex
treme left flank."
JAPANESE DRIVEN BACK.
Russians Effectually Block the Mik-
ado's Men.
MUKDEN, March 6, noon.â Fighting
began this morning as soon as the fog
cleared and up to the present time
has been increasing in intensity. The
Russians are gradually forcing the
Japanese north and west and have
taken the villages of Tzuanvanche,
F'antziatun, Tinvinchin and two others.
General Kaulbars and his staff are on
advanced positions, directing opera
tions. The Japanese artillery is pound
ing away fiercely in the region of
Ulinpa. Some shells from ?ight-lnch
field guns, charged with Chinese pow
der, are also exploding not far away
and shrapnel is roaring.
Japanese prisoners are filing past
toward the rear. They are ravenous
with hunger. They say they started
with provisions for three days and were
then ordered to make them last for sfx
days. They had not eaten since Sun
day morning.
General Kuropatkin has ordered that
they be fed and they are eating as they
march in. In the operation on Sunday
in the district of Madzapu and Miuch
iatun the Japanese were repulsed. The
attack by the Japanese division west
of Hushitai was at first successful, but
Russian reserves arrived and checked
the Japanese.
In the villages of Sandepas and
Shakhe the Japanese seized the oppor
tunity, while the Russian corps were
changing front, to furiously endeavor
to break the line. The Japanese suc
ceeded In thrusting a wedge in the in
terval, but Russian artillery concen
trated a terrible fire of 8-lnch guns
upon the attacking force and the Jap
anese were finally driven out with
heavy loss.
The Japanese made several night at
tacks, especially at Madzyapu, which
were unsuccessful.
THOUSANDS WOUNDED.
Russian War Office Places Figure at
12,000.
ST. PETERSBURG, March 7, 3:15 a.
m.â The War Office estimates the num
ber wounded in the battle of Mukden
at 12,000, including 234 officers, but
makes no statement regarding the
number of dead. This undoubtedly is
a conservative statement. The Japan
ese losses, according to the same source
of information, are estimated at 30,000.
The optimistic tone of the war â¢cor
respondence is reflected in military cir
cles here. It is considered that, even
if General Kuropatkin has not suc
ceeded in delivering a crushing blow at
the Japanese, he has at least insured
the possibility of wlthdrawal.which was
greatly jeopardized by the operations
of General Nogi and General Kuroki.
The result of General Kuropatkin's
reported counter attack west of the
railroad, which if successful, would
drive a wedge between the western
army and the Japanese forces on the
Shakhe River, is awaited with keen
anxiety. It is felt that this is the op
portunity which he misused at Liao
yang and which deprived the Russians
of victory when it had almost been
won.
READY TO ATTACK.
Japanese Are Preparing for Decisive
Battle.
SAKHETUN, March 6, 2:45 p. m.â
According to reports just received the
Japanese have advanced to attack
along the whole line. Fighting has
been in progress on the right flank of
the Russian army near the imperial
tombs since morning, but at this hour
It appears to be lessening, and the
roar of artillery indicates that the
fighting is gradually sweeping farther
and farther from Mukden.
Several regiments stationed near
Poutiloff and Novgorod Hilla Sunday
night attacked and captured Japanese
trenches, approaching under cover of
darkness.
The fighting was sharp and the Jap
anese used hand grenades, but finally
were expelled at dawn. The weather
to-day Is superb.
WILL, INCREASE FORCE.
Reinforcement* of 400,000 Russians
for the Far East.
LiONT>ON, March 7. â The correspond
ent at St. Petersburg of the Times,
telegraphing March 6, says:
"Reassuring dispatches to-night
claim that the Japanese already have
used all their reserves. If he receives
positive Information on this point Gen
eral Kuropatkin will hurl his entire
force to-morrow south and southwest
of Mukden and try to break Oyama 's
army.
"At a preliminary meeting of the
War Council to-day (Monday) General
Dragomiroff presiding, General Gripen
berg was present. It was proposed to
send an additional 400,000 men to the
Far Bast."

Percu Hughes Is a Marvefous Pianist
LONDON. March
6. â Percy Hughes

open to any one

to this achieve

ed more than 200
prises at piano

in Wales, including
two first prizes at
Welsh musical fes

Percy was born
with a passion for
music and that ca
pacity for over
coming obstacles
which is the surest â¢
indication of gen

boy. His father is
a clerk in a Welsh
colliery, and out of
a salary which has
never exceeded $10

maintain a family
of peven children.

of the woman who was found upon
the beach at Ocean Park on February

of Mrs. N. J. Milburn of Los Angeles.

into the sea.

in this city. She went to Ocean Park
on February 23 to look at some real
estate she contemplated buying. It is
said by her relatives in this city that
she carried a considerable sum of
money, and they believe that to gain

pose of the supposed murder. It is
supposed that she was lured into a
vacant house and murdered, the body
being taken out and thrown into the
sea after nightfall. The fact that no
water was found In the lungs is proof,
it is claimed, that she was dead before
the body was cast into the sea. A
thorough investigation is being made
by the authorities.

cessor will qualify, but I believe it will
be soon."
Roberta T. Devlin is a well-known
lawyer of Sacramento, whose practice
throughout the central and northern
regions of the State is prominent and
lucrative. The anti-Debris Association
and the Southern Pacific Company are
among his clients. He was born in
Sacramento, June 13,- 1859, and educat
ed in the public schools of that city.
He was appointed a member of the
State Board of Prison Directors in 1884.
and has since been reappointed: His
term of office as director expires Jan
uary 12, 1912.
It is gossip in political circles that
! he will resign from the Prison Board
and that Governor Pardee will be re
quested to name his successor at an
early day. The impression that Mr.
.Devlin cannot hold a State office and
a Federal office at the same time is not
clear. The constitution of California,
article 4, section 20. reads: "No person
holding any lucrative office under the
United States or any other power shall
be eligible to any civil office of profit
under this State."
The office of State Prison Director is
not an office of profit. The constitu
tion, article 10, section 4. declares that
"the members of the board shall re
ceive no compensation other than rea
sonable traveling and other expenses
incurred while engaged in the perfor
mance of official duties, to be audited
as the Legislature may direct."
Mr. Devlin was elected to the State
Senate from the Thirteenth Senatorial
District in 1900 and served for four
>ears in a manner highly acceptable to
his constituents. He is a member of
executive committee of the Republican
State Central Committee and was
chosen chairman of the Republican
State C -nvention which met in Santa
Cruz on August 25, 1904, and nomi
nated Presidential electors and Con
gressmen.
Gossip says that Senator Perkins
was advised by his lieutenants in Cali
fornia that a man who keenly appre
ciated the force of political organiza
tion and who had displayed ability as
an organizer should be appointed to
the office of United States District At
torney. It is common opinion that the
Senator is looking after his own
fences. The report that Senator Flint
urged the appointment of Luther
Brown to succeed Mr. Woodworth
in not credited by the politi
cians of the inside circle. There is an
Impression that the junior Senator
yielded gracefully at the beginning to
the importunities of the senior on be
half of Mr. Devlin's appointment, but
this does not signify to the politicians
that Senator Flint has adopted a yield
ing policy. On the contrary it is as
serted that the Senator from Los An
geles will insist on a fair division of
the patronage.
Liquor Causes Insane Act.
Lillian Borgstron. a pretty 20-year

street, ran amuck last night and at

The doctors think delirium tremens

Borgstron's case than insanity.

CAR DASHES INTO CAB
WITHOUT ANY WARNING
Harry Bowman, the Driver, Is Badly
Injured in Collision in Western
Addition.
A fatal collision was narrowly
averted early yesterday morning when
car No. 1320, of the Ellis street elec
tric line, dashed into a cab driven by
Harry Bowman. The collision
curred at the corner of Ellis and
Steiner streets, and the car, which
was going- at a high rate of speed,
ran into the vehicle without sounding
a warning bell. Bowman was knock
ed to the ground and suffered a frac
ture of the right forearm, besides in
ternal Injuries that may prove se
rious.
Bowman, one of the best known
cabbies Jn the city, started out with
John Lachman and Emil Pohli. Lach
man alighted at Larkin street, but
Pohli was going farther out. Both
Bowman and Pohli say they received
no warning from the gripman as the
car approached the cab. Pohli was
thrown to the ground, but luckily
escaped injury-. The horse ran away
in the mixup and no trace of it
had been discovered since. Frank
Blue, the motorman was arrested and
charged with battery. Bowman
treated at the Park Emergency
Hospital and later removed to the
German Hospital.

OAKLAND REVIVAL CROWDS MANY CHURCHES
Great Meetings Listen to Severaf Eloquent Evangefists
OAKLAND, March 6:â The first of j
the week-day meetings of ' the great
evangelistic revival that ha 3 begun in |
Oakland took place to-night. In every |
case the churches were full, but few!
seats -being unoccupied, and while: th- j
attendance -was not so large as on
Sunday evening, It was far larger than
many believed that a Monday night i
meeting could b*Â» made in this" city. 1
Much enthusiasm is shown- by the i
â workers and it is expected that - th- >
attendance will grow as the week be- t
come* older, until the success that j
has followed thfese evangelists west- .
ward from London, England, will at- ;
tend them in Oakland. In every case
it has bf en found that the interest j
increased as the meetings continued. ,
As on Sunday, meetings were held in
five sxeat cÂ«?nters,'and so they will con
tinue throughout the weeK. Central j
Oakland has two big " tings every ,
evening, one in the First Congrega- j
tional Church and the other at the ;

Oakland meetings take place at the J
Chester Street ilethodist Church, and j
there are two meetings in East Oak- )

OSTKOMS ADDRESS.
Rev. Henry Ostrom had charge of the
services at the First Presbyterian
<"hurch, assisted by John P. Hillis as
the soloist. Mr. Ostrom chose for his
The Broad Religion," and in the
course of his sermon said:
Xot broader but higher is the watchword Of
tb* twentieth century. Why not a liberaliet
In religion* Everywhere In the Bible man is
represented as great except when in contrast
â with Jesus. Then he Is meaner than a pigmy.
Man is a great creature. So great is man that
hÂ£ can become as pure as driven mow or low
Â«â¢ than a beast. So great is man. that the
possibility of his greatness is not always man
ifest and when it becomes manifest it is as
tonishing. So great is man that he is called
not the cabin, not the adobe hut, but the
temple of th* Holy Ghent. Man is no trifling
commodity. lie is Ilk* unto a continent with
tall peaks and soft valleys with rivers and
lakes, with harbors and coast line*. One man
Is worth the whole world.
Do away with the contrast" with God and
man and man goes so high up that he is al
xnoft a god. Yet man is a great sinner as
well. I believe in the depravity of man. The
â¢scriptures tell us we are born in Bin. Even
the little child needs constant watching and
frrea* cautioning. Take the babe from the
beÂ« family in California, put him by himself
and he will become lower than a heathen
Man is an alien from God. He will walk
the streets for twelve hours and will not think
of his Creator. 1 don like to assail the*
'â Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of
Man theory." but it is an overdrawn expres
sion. The fatherhood of God only comes to
him who joins God's great family and himself
becomes a son or a daughter. The brotherhood
of man exists only when man accepts Jesus
Christ, the son of God. Man knows that he
is gu.ity. Who would not rather be a guilty
man than an innocent idiot? If they tell you
there is good In evpry man, that you sin In
Ignorance and that because you d..' not know
any better you will be forgiven, they tell you

blood of Jesus Christ, his Son, cleans
eth us from all sin."
The general theme of the discourse
was, "Does salvation destroy the ap
petites and passions for gambling, for
drink, for swearing, as well as the
many intellectual â  difficulties with
which a great many men are
swamped?" In answering this he told
a story about Mr. Moody:
"Whllt Moody was preaching in an Illinois
town during the earlier days of his career a
man drove up In his carriage and listened be
tween the puffs of his cigar to the exhortation
of the young evangelist. Mr. Moody Inquired
who he was. He was told that his name wa*
Palmer, that he was the wealthiest man in
the county, owning almost one-third of the
real estate In the town, besides large tracts of
county land, but a man so given to the habit
of swearing that his wife and daughters were
aahamed to go out with him. Mr. Moody said.
"I will go out and see him." and. notwith
standing the warning that ho would get noth
ing but a volume of oaths, the next morning
quite early found him at the front door of
the rich man's houte.
Mr. Palmer, seated on h!s porch, greeted Mr.
Moody with the question. "What do you
want?" "I wieh to see Mr. PaJmer," he re
plied. "ThafÃ my name; what have you
com* for?" Mr. Moody repÃed that he had
heard that Mr. Palmer was the richest man
In thÂ« county, that God had given him friends
and Inftuence. had given him a wife and two
lovely daughters, but that all he had ever re
turned to God for his goodness had been- oaths
and curses, "Is it Â»o?" he asked.
It was not Ion; before Mr. Moody was tn
rlted in to pray with thÂ« swearer. In the
afternoon service of that day Mr. Palmer made,
an open confession ot his faith In Christ and
begÃwi his fellow-ctttzens to forgive him for
the life he had led. Six years after thla time
Mr. Moody met Mr. Palmer In California. His
first question waa, "Palmer how about the
swearing?" "I haven't swore since, sir; God
filled me with something better," he replied.
There will be a special meeting in
the West Oakland railroad yards at
noon time to-morrow, to be addressed
by Rev. Dwlght E. Potter, Rev. H. H.
Gribben and Rev. J. C. Bolster.

Rev. James Campbell "to spend for

said, did not need it. as they were well

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY. MARCH 7. 1905.
OAKLAND'S ART
EXHIBIT OPENS
AS A SUCCESS
ZOE GREEN RADCLIFFE
OAKLAND. March t>. â As a social function
the opening reception of the Starr King art
exhibit Saturday night was a great success.
Maple Hall wa* even uncomfortably crowded
and artists and art lovers were unanimous In
praiee of the display. As usual the monotony
of picture gazing was varied by music. Miss
Ruth Waterman, contralto, and Miss Winifred
June Xc*CÂ« U, violinist, contributing several
delightful numbers.
The large number of canvases and the lack
of apace in which to hang them have necessi
tated placing many of the pictures too low to
receive meriwxl recognition, but on the whole
the exhibit Is well arranged. But the need of
a properly arranged hall, large enough for
theÂ«e annual art exhibits, is more evident
than ever. I hear that F. C. Havens has al
ready given a lot and will buiM a gallery for
the city, but as the lot is in Piedmont it would
probably share the fate of the Home Club,
which is too afar away from business centers
ever to be popular as an auditorium.
Notwithstanding the fact that the display
of work by San Francisco artists Is conspicu
ous, exhibitor*; from this side the bay are hold-
Ing thrir own very well. The one beautiful
canvas stnt in by Keith has already been
sold, the Harmon Bells being the purchasers,
I believe. C. P. NeiUon Is showing some ex
cellent work and some fine bits by Miss Annie
Frances Brings. John M. Gamble, H. D.
Gremke, Oscar Kunath, Sidney Yard De Neale
Morgan, Mrs. D. W. Gelwlcks, Mrs. Fancher
Pettis, EJa St. John Smitten, Augusta Label,
Mary Herrick Ross, Louise Carpenter and
Stella Trask have attracted much favorable
comment. A recent acquisition to California
art circles Is Gordon Coutta. The half dosen
or more canvass that h" Is showing certainly
entitle him to rank with the best.
Harry W. Seawell's work has also been the
subject of favorable criticism and Willis E
Daris is .exhibiting several delightful land
scapes. Other exhibitors whose work is at
tracting attention are: Kugen Neuhaus
G. Cadena*so, Joseph Greenbauna, Chapel Jud
son, MutK'o Sandona, H^nry Raschen and
Mary Curtl* Richardson.
The photographic display \g unusually artis
tic, the studios by Mrs. Brlgman and Mrs.
ArmtK being especially so. The art exhibit
will continue all this week, closing Friday
evening.
Mrs. William E. Mllwain Is presld-ent of

WHEELER HOUSE
AS A HOSPITAL
President Seems to Approve
Plan to Make Mansion
a Kesort for the Sick
SENDS WALSH A LETTEE
Communication of Health
Officer of Berkeley Is
Sent to the Legislature
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center street, March 6.
President Benjamin Ide Wheeler has
informally approved of the plan to
make a university hospital of the un
finished mansion built for his use by
the regents, but never occupied by
him. The president has forwarded to
Assemblyman "Philip M. Walsh of Oak
land, now at Sacramento, a letter sent
to Wheeler by Dr. Reinhardt, univer
sity physician and aLfo health officer
of Berkeley, in which Dr. Reinhardt
shows how the mansion that was to
be President Wheeler's could be fitted
up for hospital purposes and made self
supporting.
Dr. Reinhardt takes into considera
tion the fact thÂ»t the Legislature has
agreed to appropriate $1&,000 with
which to complete the big stone house
on the hill. The money could well
be spent, Dr. Reinhardt says, in mak
ing the building a first-class hospital.
There are 3000 persons in and about the
university, the physician argues, Who
would be eligible to admission to the
place when ill, and an annual fee from
them of $2 each would provide $6000,
or sufficient to support the institution,
with private contributions that might
be made. There is now in the regents'
hands, it is said, several thousands of
dollars that might be used for this
hospital project. The money referred
to reDresents property once owned by
the Berkeley Hospital Association, a
university adjunct that sought to es
tablish a hospital in Berkeley.
The project failed because of the op
position of property owners who ob
jected to locating the proposed hos
pital near their residences. The prop
erty of the association was then sold
and the proceeds were given, to the
regents with the understanding that
they would be applied to the securing
of beds in hospital for sick students .
It is said that President Wheeler
would favor using the uncompleted
mansion on the hill as his own resi
dence instead of for a hospital if the
regents would agree to give him, in his
new mansion, the money now paid for
the rental of his nresent home. This,
however, the regents have shown no
signs of â¢ desiring to do, and accord
ingly the hospital project is expected to
prove the final solution of the problem
presented by the "white elephant" in
the shape of the big stone house.
DESPONDENT WIDOW
ENDS HER OWN" LIFE
While Seated In a Chair She Slowly
Suffocates to Death by the
Use of Gas.
OAKLAND, March 6.â Mrs. Mary
E. Putney, 54 years old, a widow,
committed suicide to-day at 551
Franklin street, where for eighteen
years she had resided as housekeeper
for James Vignier, a hotel man at
that place. Her body was found rest
ing in a chair in her room. From a
gas stove Mrs. Putney had run a rub
ber to her mouth, inhaling the deadly
iluid until death ensued. The odor of
the escaping gas attracted attention.
No explanation was made by any of
the woman's friends as to the cause
of suicide, except that she had been
despondent of late. She left no mes
sage.
Mrs. Putney was a native of San
Jose. She leaves a brother named
O'Brien, a resident of that city. The
Coroner took charge of the case.

Teeth Pictures.
The growing fad of having tne teetb
to show Jh photographs is destructive
to art and a spoliation of whatever of
beauty may be in a woman's face.
The smile that won't come off is ex
ceedingly tiresome. Pretty teeth are
pitifully rare, and sweet smiles are
rarer. Even men are having their pic
tures taken with grins on. They look
like ninnies. Shut your mouths before
the camera, you simpletons of both
sexes, and don't give yourselves away.

FACTORY SHE
IS PURCHASED
Magnesite Company Closes
Deal for Thirty Acres of
Best Water Front Property
BIG PLANS .PROJECTED
Three Plants to Be ErecteÂ»i
in East Oakland, Giving
Employment to Many Men
Oakland Ofliee San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, March 6.
The American Magnesite Company,
which owns the famous Red Mountain
mines south of Livermore, has closed
its deal for a large aeciion of water
front in Oakland and will at once be
gin constructing its manufacturing
plants. The company has bought
nearly thirty acres of water front in
East Oakland on what is known as
Sessions Basin. This water front prop
erty was owned by J. L. da Fremery,
who is In the East, and the deal was
concluded through E. P. Vandercook,
his agent on this coast.
The property has a long frontage
upon the East Oakland basin, and is
directly on the line of the new work
that is being outlined by the Federal
Government and for which the last
Congress has appropriated $250,000.
There is ample area for the different
plants that will be erected by the
Magnesite Company for the handling
of their ore. One plant will be for
the manufacture of fire brick, an
other for the manufacture of a patent
building material, a third for the
manufacture of carbonic acid gas, and
in addition there will be wharves and
bunkers for the shipping of their ore
to Eastern and foreign ports in bulk.
The deal will mean the employment
of many men in Oakland, and many
more In the Livermore district, from
which point ttys ore will be shipped to
Oakland.
The Board of Supervisors haa
undertaken to build a good rottd from
Livermore to the mines, and a con
tract for the work was let some
months ago. Harry N. Morse con
tested the legality of the award be
fore Judge Sloss of San Francisco and
the Supervisors were to-day notified
that the proceedings were illegal. The
board has already started nefr work,
and Road Overseer Dave McDonald of
Livermore has now the petitions in
proper shape and at the next meeting
of the board bids will be advertised
for.
ARREST CHARGED
TO SPITE WORK
Woman Sues Neighbor for
Causing Her to Be Tried
for Mental Ud soundness
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, March 6.
As a result of a neighborhood quar
rel at Melrose Mrs. Laura Stickney to
day began suit for $10,000 damages
against J. P. Brevoort for causing her
arrest on a charge of insanity. She
says she was subjected to the humilia
tion of arrest and kept in confinement
for twenty-four hours at the Receiv
ing Hospital.
The arrest took place Just a year ago,
but since then the ill feeling has been
kept alive, according to her. by neigh
borhood gossip and attempts to poison
her chickens. Now she intends to take
steps that she believes will gain her a
hearing. At the time her examination
took place Judge Melvtn commented
strongly on Brevoort's action ha caus
ing her arrest upon such a charge.
EARLIEST APPEARANCE
OF RAILROAD TIME TABLES
The Guides of Early Days Now Re-
garded as Rare and
Costly Relics.
It is Just sixty-five years ago since
George Bradshaw, the Quaker engraver
mapmaker of* Manchester, England,
was first inspired to publish his "Time
Table." It was a tiny pamphlet bound
in green cloth, and was nothing more
than a collection of the monthly time
tables issued by the seven railway
companies then in existence in Eng
land. Of thiÃ volume there are now
only four copies in existence, but they
are worth their weight in gold.
So- encouraged was Bradshaw by the
success of this time table that in 1840
he published his "Railway Companion,"
a volume of thirty-eight pages with
maps which sold at a shilling. These
early guides were published rather Ir
regularly because of the difficulty of
learning the change? in times from the
railway authorities. They resented
Bradshaw's interference and put every
obstacle in the way of his obtaining in
formation. At last, through the
Quaker's perseverance, they finally
agreed to adjust their time tables by
the beginning of the month. There
after it was smooth sailing. The guide
continued to grow and prosper and to
make itself a necessity.
These early railway guides make in
teresting reading. The trains are de
scribed as first-class, second-class,
mixed, fast and mail. Third-cliss
travelers had the choice of sitting on
the roofs or in open wagons resembling
cattle trucks. Gentlemen riding in
thejr own carriages were charged
second-class fare. Baggage was car
ried on the roof, and passengers who
sat there were cautioned to wear their
overcoats #nd provide themselves with
gauze spectacles. Pirst-Â«lass fare be
tween London aad Birmingham was
r.early double what it is to-day, and an
annual subscription ticket from London
to Brighton and back coat $500.âChi

Force of Great Waves.
NEW YORK, Jan. 14.â Recent exper
iments made at the Bell Rock and
Skerryvore lighthouses on the Scottish
Coast have shown that while the force
of breakers in the German Ocean may
be taken as about a ton and a half on
every square foot of surface, Atlantic
breakers fall with a weight of about
three tons to the square foot. In No
vember, IS2+, during a heavy gale,
huge blocks of granite and limestone
were washed about like pebbles at the
Plymouth breakwater, carried 306 fee*
up its inclined plane and scattered be
yond it in all directions. One of the
| blocks weighed nearly two tons.

One Member Declares That

Sport Demoralises Boys
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, March Â«.
By a vote of 9 to 2, the City Council
to-night adopted a resolution com
mending Assemblyman Esp*ys ami
race track gambling bill, and urging
the Senate to pass the measure, the
bill having already passed the. Assem
bly. The resolution, which was intro

lows:
"Whereas, Assembly bill 280, intro
duced by R. H. E. Espey of this city,
the purpose of which is to prohibit pool
selling, bookmaking and other forms of
gambling on horse racinsr is now be
fore the State Senate, and
'Whereas, we, the City Council of the
city of Oakland, do recognize the per
nicious influence of the race track and
its attendant evils, and
"Whereas, we believe that much of
the crime committed within our bor
ders is directly attributable to the in
ftuence of the race track. Therefore
be it
"Resolved, That we do highly com
mend the act of Mr. R. H. E. EÂ»p?y
in introducing and successfully promot
ing the said bill in the Assembly and
we u*ge the Senators representing this
county and all the members of the Sen
ate to do everything possible to secure
the passage of this bill at the present
session of the Legislature."
Councilmen Fitzgerald and Baccus
voted against the resolution. Fitzger
ald declared it uncalled for and out of
place. Councilman Elliott declared he
faVored the resolution, not because he
opposed* racing as a sport for
men, but he added, "The race track is
stuck under our noses, and it is a place
where boys from 14 to 21 years of age
can swagger about with a cigarette in
their mouths and gamble away the %2
it has taken some of them a week to
earn."
ADOPTS OLD
WATER RATES
Oakland's Council of the
Opinion That Conditions
Do Not Warrant Change
OAKLAND, March 6.â The City
Council to-night re-enacted the water
rates of lar-t year for the coming fiscal
year. This schedule is from 25 to 30
per cent under the rates that are be
ing collected by the Contra Costa
Water Company at present, an injunc
tion beinÂ« in force against the 1904
schedule. President Dornia, in pre
senting- the report on the rates sched
ule from the committee of the whole,
said:
"The company's statements show a
material increase during the year on
all the revenue-Droctucing fixtures ex
cept the sale of water by meter. It ia
therefore apparent that the application
of the rates fixed by the Council last
year would result, in a large measure,
in a large Increase in the company's
revenue over that contemplated by the
schedule.
"The committee therefore discussed
carefully the propriety of reducing the
hydrant rate, but finally concluded that
it would be ill-advised to complicate
the last injunction case by having an
other schedule introduced this year.
However, your committee firmly be
lieves and reiterates its views of last
year, that the values and rates estab
lished last year are liberal and more
than fair and just to the company."
Dornin, for the committee, submitted
a comparison of Oalcrand and San
Francisco rates and concluded:
"All these show plainly that the
rates fixed by this Council in 1904, al
though some 30 per cent below the
rates under which the water company
is now operating, are still far in ex
cess of the San Francisco rates."
ELOPING WIFE

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, March 9.
With his wife gone with . another

John M. Deniz of Atvarado asked the
courts for an injunction to-day against
the Union Savings Bank to prevent its

Alyarado Bank 'â and drew out the de
posit. Fearing she might do the same

Applauded l\v a Crowded
Hou<o at the Columbia
A "Tannhauser" that would have set
caps flying at the Tivoli was given at
the Columbia last night by the Savage
<;rand Opera Company. Being at the
Columbia, the enthusiasm was less
picturesque, though the audience re
mained for a curtain call or two even
after the last act, in spite of the lack of
Latin ferment. But a box party or two
from Broadway- would have helped
things amazingly. They would have
Been, for example, after the truly splen
did climax of the second act, that Con
ductor Schenck came on stage. They
â would have remembered him even
through the entr'acte and given him
a hand" on his return.
For it was a. good deal Mr. Scheock's
night.
The conductor's work of last night
would seem to show that the condi
tions of conducting thÂ» Columbia
orchestra â with half of It under your
toes were perhaps wholly responsible
for the lack of grip In Mr. Schenck's
first "Carmen" and 'Lohengrin" per
formances. Crispness, spirit, a firm
pulse were as agreeably in evidence in
the conducting last night as the dig
nity and breadth that distinguished
both the â¢'Lohengrin" and "Tannhaus
er." And Mr. Schenck'a people met
him more than half way. It was good,
thoroughly good, Wagner they gave,
and ever- the Bayreuther may be rec
ommended to the next performance.
They c:d not begin well, that is,
after the prelude, that prcved popular
a* always. But the Venusberg, with
* e^riÃh lighting, was even a more
ihan usual hopelessly unseductive
habitation. Then Mr. Wegener, to re

BUILDING AND LOAN
MEASURE VOTED DOWN
AFTER SHARP DEBATE
Strong Opposition
Develops in As
sembly. â¢
Cromwell Leads the
Fight in Heated
Session.
Specla; Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, March 6.â The Ab
eembly to-night denied passage to the
building and loan bill presented by the
select cc-mmittee of five from the joint
building and loan committee and
known variously as the Curtin, the
Hahn and the Grange bill, also as Sen
ate bill 723. Cromwell of Petaluma led
the fight and was ably assisted by
Beardslee, Amerige and others, all of
whom stood for the small home or
local associations as against the na
tionals.
Cromwell, after denouncing the bill
as it stood aa a measure that would
cause loss lo small Investors and to the
honest small companies that were help
ing them to save their earnings, sub
mitted forty-one amendment*, making
radical changes, and moved their adop
tic-n. There was a long and exciting
debate and amid a great hubbub the
amendments were defeated by a vote
of M to 33. afiei they had first been
carried. 37-22, some of the San Fran
cisco members changing their votes.
BATTLE *XJR DELAY.
This morning the measure was called
up for final passage by Transue of Los
Angeles, chairman of the Assembly
Buiiding and Loan Associations Com
mittee.
"I have' some amendments to that
bill, which I wish to prepare," said
Cromwell, "and I ask that it go over
until 4 o'clock that I may have time
to get them Into shape."
Transue at once opposed d*laj.
He gave Cromwell the credit of hav
ing good intentions in the matter and
made the declaration that interested
parties were trying to defeat all build
ing and loan legislation attempted at
this session. He offered as an amend
ment to Cromwell's motion that the
bill be taken up immediately upon
reconvening in the afternoon. He
gave as a reason for thlÂ» that
the Senate file would be taken ud at
that time and he wanted to see no
delay.
" We can take up this measure last
on the Senate file as well as first." in
sisted Cromwell. "This Senate bill
was framed hastily and if the other
house had time to put in its amend
ments, we should have time to put in
ours."
"While I know nothing of the
amendments to be offered by Mr.
Cromwell," eaid Chandler, "I do know
that thie building and loan bill
is one of the most important before
this Legislature and I shall oppose
any effort to push it through with un
due haste."
"It depends altogether on the de
bate which way my vote on this bill
will go." said Anthony. "I know lit
tle about the subject and want to be
Informed."
"Tf this matter goes over till 4
o'clock it will give time to those who
wish it to prepare amendments," said
Bueick. "If there is not time left
then to d'scuss It we can take it up
to-morrow morning and no Just in
terest will suffer."
Transue receded from his position
and it was agreed that it should go
over until 4 o'clock.
LONG LIST OF OBJECTIONS.
At the afternoon session Transue
resumed his argument and talked for
an hour. The wrangle that followed
lasted until 6 o'clock.
Cromwell at the night session sub
mitted his amendments. They .prac
tically tore the bill to pieces, doing
away with the sale of "investment cer
tificates." cutting out the savings
bank features of loans to members
"and others." striking out the provision
for the deposit of securities with the
Secretary of State or banks, cutting
out entrance and withdrawal fees,
eliminating the clause prescribing a li
cense fee for solicitors and cutting out
the definition of "deposits" In the sec
tion of the bill referring to minors
holding stocks or making deposits.
Cromwell said that what was re
ferred to fourteen times In the bill as
"investment certificates" was not de
fined anywhere in the bill, but had
been explained as being the same as
bonds, and no concern doing business
on the building and loan plan has Â»a
right to Issue bonds. He asserted that
lending to members and "others'" cre
ated hydra-headed organizations upon
wtiieh there were not sufficient restric
tions; that depositing securities with
banks was unnecessary under another
part of the bill providing that the notes
must hear on their face the word*
"non-negotiable." and would also gfv*
banks an insight into an association's
private business and enable them to
take away Its business; that the
"wherever*." "whenevers" and "how
*vers" would let in every kind
of a corporation that lends money
on realty, even tontines and get
rich-quick concerns; that In smail
towns the secretaries of the mutuala
went out and secured business and the
imposing of a license fee for solicit
ing would Injure them; that the smaller
concerns do not now have a paid-up
capital, and that the portion referring
to minors holding stocks was purely
a savings bank feature.
"If the amendments are not adopted,"
said Amerige, "I must vote against the
whole bill."
Cromwell read a letter from Secre
tary Corbin of the Continental, ln
â  dorsing the Hahn-Curtin-Grange bill.
Anthony said the letter was a "das
tardly political trick."
Severance said Grange and the na
] tionals were trying to freeze out the
locate, which had built him a hJtne.
Eepey said h* 1 hed many telegrams
j from his constituents urging the defeat
: of the bill, which, he said, had been
| framed by the Corbina and Granges.
The votp was H7 to 32 against the bill.

Paid at Least $550 a Year
LAWS ON LITIGATION
Provision for Cases Which
May Grow Out of the
Reclamation Assessments
SACRAMENTO, March 6.â Seven
Senate bills received the. approval of
Governor Pardee to-day. Three of the
measures, Nos. 193, 196 and 190, intro
duced by Sanford of Mendocino, sim
plify the px-ocess and lessen the possi
bilities of litigation in the assessment
of reclamation districts.
Anderson's bill. No. 246, which was
signed by the Governor, provides that
all school teachers must be paid a sal
ary of at least $650 a year.
Other bills approved were:
By Hahn, No. 98, permitting either
side in a law case to require the court
to instruct the jury to bring in a spe
cial verdict.
By Rowell, No. 266, providing that
pupils residing in a district where there

FOR A STATE BRIDGE.
Resolution Calls for Inquiry Into Car-
quinez Situation.
SACRAMENTO, March o.â The fol
lowing concurrent resolution relative
to the bridging of Carquinez Straits
was introduced in the Assembly this
morning by Moore of San Joaquln: I
Resolved by the Assembly of the State of
California, the Senate concurring, that a Joint
committee of the Senate and Assembly, con
sisting of four members, be appointed, two by
the President of the Senate and two by the
Speaker of the Assembly, to examine Into and
report upon the advisability and coÂ«t of the
designing and of the construction by the State
of California of a State toll combination sus
pension bridge across Carquinez Straits at a
point which would be the most convenient to
all traffic, such as steam and electric railroad,
wagon and foot traffic.
That the said Joint committee be and is
hereby authorized and empowered to do any
and all necessary things to make a full and
complete lnvestiKatlon of all matters In con
nection therewith In order that a full and
complete report may be made, and to that
end the said committee Is hereby authorized
and empowered to employ all necessary clerical
and expert assistance and also to call Into con
sultation any and all persons deemed necessary
by said committee to make a full and complete
report in accordance with this resolution.
"I have introduced the resolution at
the request of my constituents in the
reclamation districts," said its author.
"They wish to* take such steps as will
preclude the construction of a pile
bridge. In sruch structure the piles
would have to be placed so close that
they would collect the debris and
practically form a dam that would
prevent the free flow of the water and
cause a greater strain on the levees
above."
On motion of Moore the resolution
was adopted and sent to the Senate.
At the afternoon session Stanton
moved for a reconsideration of the
vote by which the resolution had been
adopted, saying that under its pro
visions an unlimited sum might be
spent by the commission. The recon
sideration was granted and the reso
lution made a special order for to
morrow.
AFFECTS WATEat SUPPLY.
Bill Passed by Which City Could Lose i
Mountain Source.
SACRAMENTO, March 6. â Duryea '
brought up In the Assembly this after
neon Pendleton's Senate bill, Identical j Â£
with his own, relating to eminent do
main and dealing among other things i
v Ith water stored in reservoirs or flow- \
ing in pipes. 1
Treadwell opposed the bill, saying: 1
"Under this provision the water stored
in reservoirs in one county and used l
for supplying water to the inhabitants t
of another county could be condemned ]
and taken for Irrigation or other pur
poses in the county where It is stored. ]
Under such a law the water of the '
Spring Valley Water Company stored
in the counties of San Mateo and Ala
meda for the inhabitants of San Fran
cisco could be condemned for the pur
pose of irrigation by the inhabitants
of the counties of San Mateo and Ala
meda,
. "The city and county of San Fran- i
cisco Intends to at some time have Its i
own water supply, which will require
reservoir sites in some mountain coun
ty, and representatives of that city ,
have Just returned from Washington
for the purpose of obtaining the con
sent of the Government to carry out
such a project; but under this law a
rival company could instigate â¢ con
demnation proceedings of the water ,
after lr was obtained and stored at
grea*t expense by the city, and. ac
cording to this act, the only damage
they would have to pay to the city
would be the value per one thousand
gallons of water taken. In other words,
the city would lose the entire expense
of the construction of reservoirs and
pipes, and would simply get the value ;
of the water.
"This bill is followed up by a com
panion measure known as Senate bill J
872, which provides that any twenty
householders of the county where the
water is stored can compel the Board
of Supervisors of the county where It j
is stored to condemn the water. If i
these two bills should become a law it j
would be absolutely Impossible for any
city to ever obtain a water supply from
the mountain counties.
'It Is elementary and always has
been the law of this State that where
property was already applied to one |
public use it cannot be condemned for
another public use, unless it is a public j
use of a higher character and one more .
necessary to the public, but by this I
act water applied to the highest public I
j use known to the law. that is, the I
I supplying of water for the inhabitants I
â¢' of cities for human consumption, could ]
|be condemned for irrigation or any i
; other purpose?. "
. Devlin also spoke against the bill,
i which came up on reconsideration after
having been defeated Saturday morn
ing, but it was passed this time byja
vote of 47 to 24 and is now up to the j
Governor.

Senator Ralston's Measure
Lost by the Decisive Vote
of Twenty-Seven to Four

Argument Prevails That the
3lain Points It Contains
Are Covered Elsewhere
Special D'.cpatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, March 6.â The clos
ing week of the Legislature opened in
the Senate this morning with a hot
debate on Ralston's bill declaring that
those guilty of boycotting, blacklisting
or similar offenses shall be deemed
guilty of a misdemeanor. The bill waa
defeated by a vote of 27 to I.
Kane, Markey and Shortridge led the
fight against the bill. They advanced
the contention that the bill could serve
no purpose, as its principles are al
ready sustained by decisions of all of
the courts of the land. Wolfe, Welch
and Ward also attacked the bill on
similar grounds.
Lukens, Irish and Ralston suoke In j
favor of the measure. They said that ;
if the principles in the bill were al- ,
ready affirmed by the higher courts of ,
the land they could not see what ob- j
Jectlon the representatives of union la- j
bor could have to the measure. It ,
would be a guide, they said in con- j
elusion, that would save the courts the
trouble of interpreting the various de- i
cislons and would also provide for the
punishment of those that violated the
principles known to exist.
The bill was defeated, however, and
as no motion for reconsideration was
made it is dead, at least so far as the
present session is concerned.

SACRAMENTO, March 6.â Ralston's
Senate constitutional amendment pro
posing to extend the life of corpora
tions from fifty years to an indefinite
period was adopted by the upper house
to-night by a vote of 27 to 5. Senator
Lukens was practically alone in debate
opposing the bill. Senators Curtin and
Pendelton led the debate In favor of
the bill.
Beardslee's Assembly bill providing
that the separate property of the wife
is liable for debts incurred for house
hold expenses was passed by the Sen
ate to-day. Other bills passed by the
Senate were:
By Irish, providing for the issuance
of certificates of registration to nurses
by the State university regentW.
By Busick, imposing a license tax on

vassers of agricultural Implements,
wagons, buggies and other articles.
By Branstetter, to prevent decep

TO REGUIjATE WFRING.
Atkinson's Bill Given the Right of
Way.
SACRAMENTO, March 6. â During
the early part of the session three bills
affecting electrical Interests were in
troduced by members of the San Fran
cisco delegation â one by Strohl pro
viding for an electrical Inspector, one
by Cullen regulating the erection of
poles and the stringing of electric
wires, and the third by \ Mindham,
regulating the installation cjf electrical
apparatus in buildings. Tb/ey were all
referred to the Committee on Corpor
ations. To-day Atkinson moved that
they all be reported back from the
committee and their authors be al
lowed to withdraw them. This re
quest was complied with.
Atkinson then asked that his own
bill, designated "An act to regulate the
placing, installing and maintaining of
electric light and power work, wirings
and appliances in buildings and other
structures," be withdrawn from the
Committee on Corporations and placed
on the special file without recommen
dation. He said he had the permis
sion of the committee to have this
done nnd the request was accordingly
complied with. His bill is a union
labor measure.
RAISES JURORS' FEES.
Senate Also Favors University Chair
in Music.
SACRAMENTO. March 6. â San
Francisco's delegation made a futile
fight in the Senate to-night against
Irish's bill, raising Jurors' fees from
$2 to S3 a day. The San Franciscans
pointed to the great burden the in
crease would mean to San Francisco,
but San Francisco's wealth to the
mind of the interior Senator, is limit
less. The result was that the bill
went through, and as no motion for
reconsideration was made, the action
was final so far as the upper house
Is concerned.
Paeffles bill, appropriating $6000
for the establishment of a school of
music at the University of California,
also passed the Senate to-night.

YOUTH PROUD
OF HIS CRIMES
Lorenzo Steffanini Arrives
From Sunny Italy to Ply
Vocation of Highwayman
IDENTIFIED AS ROBBER
Daniel Sullivan and George
Earl Are Arrested as Ac
complices of Daring Lad
Lorenzo Steffanini, 19 years of age,
turned highwayman^ two months ago
and the police claim he is responsible
for several desperate crimes commit
ted within that space of time. He Is
now in the City Prison charged with
robbery and two other men, Daniel
Sullivan and George Earl, have been
arrested and will be charged with hav
ing been implicated with him In the
holdups. Steffanini maintains an air
of bravado and seems to glory In his
deeds. The police think he will make
a complete confession to-day and that
he and his companions will be landed
behind prison bars with little difficulty.
Steffanini came to this city from Italy
a short time ago with relatives and has
done but little work since he arrived
here. Sullivan is a prize fighter and
Earl is a well-known crook from Kan
sas City. The trio occupied a room at
521 Pacific street.
Steffanini and his companions have
been positively Identified by Giovanni
Tischorina, an Italian fisherman at
35 Prospect place, as being the men
who held him up and robbed him of
$17 about one week ago. The crime
was committed at the corner of Vallejo
and Sansome streets and the men car
ried revolvers. Steffanini was un
masked, but the other two men had
their features concealed on this occa
sion. In the other robberies attributed
to the men, all three wore masks. It
was due to the fact that Steffanini
wore nothing on his face when the
fisherman was robbed that Detectives
Bunner and Matherson secured a clew
that led to his identity
Many other crimes are attributed to
the men and a number of people will
be called to Identify them to-day.
George Carlyle, 1621 Dupont street was
held up and robbed in Jasper place on
February 13 and his gold watch and
diamond stud taken from him. The
detectives assert Sullivan pawned the
pin and Earl disposed of the watch in
a pawnshop. Both articles have been
recovered. Joseph Spousi, 618 Front
street, waÃ held up in the railroad
yards of the Belt line last Friday
and robbed of $31 by three men
answering the description of
the accused. Bido Rlvol was robbed
at the corner of Franklin and Lombard
streets on March 1 and lost $7. The
police will probably charge Sullivan
and Earl to-day.
feated after an extended debate.
Shortridge opposed the bill, saying he
believed the people should be permit
ted to decide for themselves whether
or not they want to eramble.
COIX FOR THK CLERKS.
Bill In the Assembly for After Session
Payments.
SACRAMENTO, March 6. â A reso
lution was introduced In the Assem
bly this morning by Bliss, authorizing
the payment from the contingent fund
of sums running from $50 to $250 and
aggregating $1825 to various clerks
for services they are supposed to per
form after the session. There was a
demand that the resolution be read In
full and a motion was made and car
ried that It, go to the Committee on
Ways and Means.
Stanton, chairman of that commit
tee, introduced a humorous resolution
that any money that happened to be
left in the contingent fund after ad
journment be distributed among the
attaches, whether they had been
present during the session or not.
Druggist BUI Withdrawn.
SACRAMENTO, March 6. â Cleve
land of Santa Cruz to-day withdrew
his Assembly bill providing that no
druggist shall prescribe for" a patient.
It was introduced at the suggestion of
physicians and though amended to
partly suit the druggists they were
prepared to fight it.

THE RIVER BILL.
THERE are gratifying evidences of a modus vivendi between the
committee and the land owners in regard to the bill which will
focus the action of the Legislature upon river rectification. It
is recognized by the land owners that the initiative and the bill prop
erly originated with the committee, and it is* also doubtless recog
nized by the committee that its work is greatly strengthened by the
appearance in the matter of the land owners.
The relation is as natural as it is necessary. Suppose this con
fluent action had not been taken in perfecting the bill ! Then Con
gress, when asked to give Federal aid, would at once query, "Why
do not the land owners come forward and offer something?" Just
what answer our members of Congress would make to this may be
imagined. They would have to say that they do not know why. This
would throw the burden back upon the land owners, who would nat
urally answer that they were not asked, or were not permitted by the
committee to take part. Then we would have all furnished and
ready one of those situations so dear to the Congressional heart
when it beats high for the use of money elsewhere, and the whole
matter would fade from the files by the opposition or the passive
attitude of friends, saying, "There seems to be something wrong. It
is a disagreement between the local committee and the land owners.
Let them get together and then come here."
Ry that time what was in the beginning merely a negative sit
uation, caused by the failure of parties to co-ordinate their efforts,
would develop here into active antagonism, and getting together
would be very difficult. No close observer of the situation doubts
the utility of co-operation. The land owners admit it by the action
they have taken, and the committee by assenting to the inclusion of
their ideas in the original bill. It is a matter in which there is no
room for the pride of paternity of the bill itself, nor for the prepara
tion of a claim of the credit for what is finally accomplished.
The work concerns many people and a variety of interests, run
ning all the way from the producer to the consumer, and from the
land owners to the river boatmen. Before success is reached it will
be found that there is work enough for all to have a hand in, and an
impact of influence will be required, from which the force of none
should be missing. All the wisdom required is not with one man,
ror with one interest, but with all. The consensus of opinion puts
popular force behind the great project. The Sacramento Valley De
velopment Association perhaps represents a greater number of the
many interests involved than any other organization, and appears
to be investing all of its energies wisely, to secure results. With it
in active co-operation with the land owners, and the executive com
mittee of the River and Drainage Association, there is every evidence
that no energy will be lost or unwisely directed.
In the unfolding of the reclamation plan opposition will appear
that is not now in sight. It will be found around the shores of
Suisun Bay. and it will be so powerful and portentous as to ad
monish the friends of river rectification that to succeed they must
stand together and stand close. Getting into the habit will be
helpful in that day when the real opposition is encountered and the
real work is to be done.
It is a mistake to suppose that every difference of opinion is
indicative of opposition to the work itself, for it is not. Xor may it
be considered wisdom to permit any difference of opinion between
the friends of the general purpose, to degenerate into opposition.
There is great promise that what all hope for may be accomplished,
and the day of accomplishment may be advanced by avoiding mis
understandir.
THE INAUGURAL.
r pHK stately inauguration ceremony at Washington on Saturday
satisfied the love of a free people for pageantry, because it
brought together in the marching column a half century of his
tory and a century of expectation. Sections and sectionalism were
obliterated, and the whole people came together in hearty brother
hood and patriotic accord.
The President was moved upon by the spirit of the day and In
hi? brief inaugural presented all of our genius as a people, and our
purpose and aspiration as a nation. The note in it most prominent
was its sense of common citizenship, equal rights, common privileges,
the dignity of individual character transferred to the Government
itself, and the enforcement of universal justice in the world, by beinÂ£
just ourselves as a nation. There was no trace of partisanship in it.
The President of all the people heartily greeted the representatives
of all the people.
It was a spectacle to impress the people of the world. It taught
rulers the safety of a reliance upon an intelligent and free people
who make their own government and order and direct it. And it
ght the people the value of relying upon themselves.
President Roosevelt has now entered upon a full term in the
Presidency, which he voluntarily makes his last. It may be said
truthfully, and without reflection upon his predecessors in the great
office, that he begins his term freer than any before him. No strings
lead to the White House, and no path to the back stairs. Men musi
meet him face to face and publicly, and no matter who they are or to
what party they belong, if they bring ideas in government they will
stand or fall by the merit of what they bring. His election was ac
iplished without incurring side obligations. It was the verdict of
the people upon his personality, and expressed their judgment upon
the importance of bis relations to his countrymen. There is neither
veil nor wall between him and the people. The country is pros
perous; what evils exist are corrigible by the employment of wisdom
tnd patience, and we will go on. giving new evidence of the vitality
and of the corrective power of free institutions.
FILIPINO PROGRESS ASSOCIATION.
A NOTEWORTHY feature of the world's work is 'the recent
formation of the Filipino Progress Association, with a long
list of men of national prominence as its officers, and the
purpose to procure and disseminate information concerning- indus
trial, commercial and political conditions in the Philippine Islands;
to promote legislation in Congress favorable to the Filipinos ; : ; to
promote the fulfillment of the hope expressed by President Roose
velt in his inaugural message, that the Philippine "islands shall event
ually stand "in some such relation to the United States as Cuba now
stands." '.-..â 
The names of the men who officer the association are a suffi
cient guarantee that its work will be wisely planned and wisely exe
cuted. Jacob Gould Schurman is its president, and among its
forty-six vice presidents are such well known men as Andrew Car
negie, President Charles. W. Eliot, Marshall Field; Cardinal James
Gibbons, Rev. Edward Everett Hale, President David Starr Jor
dan, and the Hon. Hoke Smith. On the executive committee are
Dr. Felix Adler and Rev. Charles H. Parkhurst.
The association has presented a petition to Congress to confer
on the Philippine Commission, or on the Philippine Legislature, soon
to be organized, the power to enact a law for the restriction or pro
hibition of the sale of opium in the islands. Although from the be
ginning of our relations with China it has been the policy of our
Government to insist that no American should take part in the
opium trade, it is a fact that opium is admitted to the Philippines on
payment of duties fixed by Congress, and freely bought and sold
there.
The Philippine Government has had" a committee, on which
serves an American officer, a Filipino physician, and an American
Bishop, investigating the methods of regulating the trade in other
Asiatic countries. This committee recommends as a model tiit
regulations which the Japanese law provides for Formosa.
It will be observed that from this method of procedure the
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL. TUhSDAY, MARCH 7, 1905.
MARCH ROSES
Campbell MacLeod
THE French Opera House was
ablaze with light. Cutside an
eager crowd drank in the beau
ties that alighted from carriages
and ran lightly up the stairway
to a gorgeous palace of light within.
Suddenly there was a stir. Madam
Lafayette drove up. Her gray-haired
coachman climbed ponderously down
and threw open the door for Madam
to alight. In her ancient black silk
dress, with its voluminous train and
decorations of rare old lace, she might
have passed for a dowager duchess.
She was followed by a slim slip of a
girl in a white dress that bespoke
Madam's ante-bellum ideas of style.
"Ah, there ees Lucien now," Madam
breathed In an agitated tone of relief,
as an old man quickly pushed his way
through the crowd to her side. The
three passed up the broad stairs and
disappeared within.
None of the carnival balls is more
gorgeous than Proteus. ' And to the
girl who was seeing it for the first
time the scene was of Arabian Night
splendor. She was leaning on her el
bow, drinking in all the tropical
beauty in the ballroom below. The
maskers flitted to and fro, bestowing
favors on expectant maidens, waiting
to be "called out."
A very gorgeous young Romeo
leaned against a friendly column near
the throne on the stage below and
surveyed the crowd with indifferent
eyes. It was such an old thing to
him â he was tired of it all. "Buds,
buds, buds!" he muttered to himself.
"The years come; the years go â "
Suddenly his eyes rested on stately
Madam Lafayette. It was the first
time in ten years that she had attended
a carnival ball. What did It mean?
Since the death of Gerald, her youngest
son, ten years before, she had not crossed
her threshold to go out into the world.
Gerald had been his dearest friend.
He must hasten to pay his respects to
Madam. And then his eyes fell on the
girl beside her. It was a face like a
wild rose â a face that told its own
story. This was her first carnival ball,
and she was living only in seeing the
others enjoy it. She leaned far over
the railing of the box and kept time
unconsciously with the music of the
waltz. Madam's old place had been
usurped. Ten years ago her box would
have been crowded. Now it was empty,
except for the three â herself, her an
cient brother and the young girl.
Romeo saw at a glance that Madam
regretted having come.
He forgot his ennui In the sudden
scheme that presented itself to his
mind. He would make the little wild
rose enjoy herself. He beckoned to
an usher who knew Madam and con
fided in him. A whispered consulta
tion provided for a possible disap
pointment. Then the sympathetic old
man who had "called out" so many
belles wended his way upstairs to
bring the little wild rose down.
Madam remembered him. Had he
not been on the committee for years?
She presented him to her niece, Eu
genic del Fete. He delivered his mes
sage! He had been commanded by
Romeo of the most noble house of
Montague to come for the young lady
who accompanied Madam. Surely she
would not disappoint so noble a youth
whose evening's pleasure lay in the
prospect of being allowed to honor
her with his attentions. Madam was

association shows that it has the wisdom not to attempt a too in
natural graft of western law abruptly upon Oriental habit in ways
so untried as to be likely to prove impractical. Their plan to model
the control substantially vpon the regulations which TÂ«'P an nas P ut ' n
force in Formosa is a good one. Japan has shown a remarkable
genius for adapting western civilization in ways of which Oriental
ism can be receptive. Her experience wisdom in dealing with
the opium vice will help our authorities in solving the problem before
them. Â»

to-night?"
all smiles. The girl rose, half timidly,
playfully tapped by Madam's fan, and
encouraged by Madam's sudden rise
of spirits, to accompany him.
"But this is Buch an unexpected
honor," she murmured to the friendly
old guide, as they descended the steps.
"Believe me, I came only as a specta
tor."
"It is flattering to be singled out in
so much beauty," he replied. "And
Romeo is considered a connoisseur,
mam'selle. The Queen herself would
be gratified at his admiration."
Romeo bowed low before her, and
more than one turned to smile in
dulgently on the contrast they made,
he splendid in lavender velvet and
pink satin, and she so unconscious of
her quaint beauty in her simple white
frock.
"You will dance?" he asked in an
eager voice, that he might have recog
nized ?.s his own ten years ago, but
which now sounded strangely unfa
miliar. "A person with your eyes
couldn't resist that music."
She hesitated, toying with her fan.
He understood her momentary con
fusion.
"It is the privilege of a masker." he
explained quickly, "to pay as many
eomnliments as he wishes so long as
they are true, Juliet. I may call you
Juilet, may I not?"
Between the dances Tom McGrath,
blase bachelor that he waÂ«j had not
time to realize what was happening to
his heart. Somehow, this girl, with
her soft gray eyes, affected him in a
way he had not been touched for a
long time. An hour ago he was tired
of the world. He was voting the uni
verse a bore and carnival balls In par
ticular a nuisance. Now he was listen
ing â and interested â while the girl
told him about Madam's yellow roses
that were trying to bloom themselves
ARE THE BLONDES
TO DISAPPEAR?
The somewhat startling statement
has been made that the blue-eyed,
golden-haired and light-complexioned
variety of the human race is In the
course of extinction and that within a
few more generations blondes are like
ly to become so rare in the world's
population that they may be looked
upon as curiosities, somewhat as
Albinos are to-day. The blonde type
has been so often chosen by artists
and poets to represent their noblest
conceptions of human beauty that no
one can regard even the bare sugges
tion of its extinction without dismay.
Moreover, some of the world's great
est races and many of its most master
ful personalities have belonged to this
type, and its admirers have sometimes
gone so far as to aver that light com
plexions, and in particularly light
colered eyes, are the favored livery of
the highest genius. v
This is undoubtedly an extreme and
untenable claim, yet it cannot be dÂ«
nied that history shows an extraordi
nary number of men and women of
the first rank in all the higher fields
of intellect who possessed the char
acteristic marks of the blonde, and
this not only In coutnries where the
light type prevails, but also in lands
like Italy, where the general complex
ion of the population is dark. â Suo

amusing disquisition on kissing. Some

To steal a kiss â Natural.
To buy a kissâ Stupid.
To kiss one's sister â Proper.
To kiss one's wife â An obligation.
To kiss ugly people â An act of gal

To kiss an ugly widow â Shows de

To kiss a blushing young widow-
Quite another thing.
To kiss your mother-in-law â A sacri

WOMEN'S CRUELTY
Mrs. Reginald DeKoven at a dinner
In Washington adverted to cruelty.
"Women can be very cruel," she
said. "Some of them can be very cun
ning, too. Some of them can wound
you so dextrously that before you
know you have been wounded their es
cape is made.
"Once I saw a young woman wound
a slightly older one in that way. She
approached the older one at a ball. She
greeted her with a radiant smile. She
inflicted her wound, and while her vic
tim still thought the wound a compli
ment she walked away. This is what,
in a very loud, clear voice, she said:
" 'Oh, Helen, dear, that perfect gown!
I think it looks lovelier every year.' "â
Louisville Courier-Journal.
to death in the garden in the middle
of March.
"Oh, yes, I remember," he inter
rupted eagerly. "It has been a long
time since I have been to see Madam,
but I remember that garden. The wall
â is it there yet? And is it as steep
as over? Steve and I have sacrificed
many a knee-cap trying to climb over
it."
"It is under the wall that the roses
grow," she began impulsively. "Don't
you remember that little corner where
the wall is grayest with age â "
"There used to be a marble seat
there," he interrupted boyishly. "And
a Cupid with a quiver and a bow."
"Such an old, old Cupid," the girl
laughed softly. "The years have
made him gray."
"That Cupid!" he said. "I should
like to see the old fellow again." He
was looking down into the face beside
him. "You are from Madam's old
home up the river, aren't you?" he
hazarded. "You are going to be here
some time, are you not?" The bach
elor had fled; a little boy was begging
a little girl not to go home for a
while.
"Possibly a month." she replied.
"She is so lonely," with a glance up
toward the balcony, where Madam sat.
"We must show her a better time,"
he whispered. "You and I."
The house was almost deserted.
Far above, in the highest gallery, the
last notes of "Home, Sweet Home,"
were dying away. Romeo, still in his
mask and domino, stooped to kiss
Madam's hand.
"Ah, Madam," he sighed happily.
"May I not serenade my love In your
garden to-night?" Eugenic blushed
and tried to hurry Madam into her
cloak.
"That depends." Madam smiled
jubilantly, fathoming the secret. "That
depends altogether on who you are,
Bir."
"Romeo of the most noble house of
Montague," bowing low, "and much
tormented with love for this maid.
To-morrow night I shall crave ad
mittance at your gate, dear lady."
Madam tapped him with her fan.
"Well â well â well," she laughed, her
old rich melodious laugh. "And I
suppose I shall have to see that you
are admitted, Sir Impudence."
A month later the gray wall was
fairly gilded with yellow roses. Cupid,
with a new washed face, pointed his
bow directly at two persons on the
marble seat. *
"Eugenic," the man whispered, "see
the miracle. My life was that dull,
gray wall. You are the roses that
have glorified It."
"You really love me so much.
Tom?" half wistfully. "You will never
be ttredâ "
Cupid, being marble, made no com
ment on the answer that interrupted
her sDeech before it was half finished.
But Madam, from her vantage point
behind the lace curtains in the back
parlor, confided to her knitting
needles:
"He ees th' vairy best catch in Nauw

WILL PROVIDE
MEMORIAL HOME
Crocker Heirs Make Known
* Wish to Raise Memorial
to Do Honor to Parents
The heirs of Colonel C. F. Crocker
have decided to provide the money to
erect an orphanage at San Mateo on
the grounds of the Bishop Armitage
Orphanage as a memorial to their par
ents. They are orphans and natives
of San Mateo. This makes their ac
tion peculiarly appropriate. No plans
for buildings have been made yet, nor
has any estimate of cost been sub
mitted. The offer was made to the
Armitage â  Orphanage Corporation.
v.hich is one of the agencies for good
of this Protestant EpiÃCopal diocese.
A meeting was recently held where the ;
fart was made known, but with the i
pledge that nothing should be made
public at that immediate time.
Bishop Nichols said yesterday that
the present buildings of the Armitage
Orphanage are inadequate for use.
They were formerly occupied as school '
structures. George W. Gibbs gave an
estate of twenty acres with the old
school buildings at San Mateo there
on. Two hundred orphan boys now
rind shelter and education at the Orph
anage.
C. E. Green, co-trustee with Henry
T. Scott of the estate -of Colonel C. F.
Crocker, said that no plan has yet
been submitted. The Crocker heirs
made the suggestion entirely on their
own motion. What the cost of the
proposed memorial would be Mr. Green
had no idea.
The Armitage Orphanage is adminis
tered by a board of trustees and by a
l>nard of lady managers. Of the latter
Mrs. A. Tubbs is the president. Some
< ommunlcations have passed concern
ing the structure to be erected, and
Mrs. TibtM has been very much inter
ested in the plan, which will be of ma
terial benefit to many orphans. Last
evening Mrs. Tubbs said that possibly
v. ithin a week something definite might
be known. In the meantime It is as
certained that a handsome memorial
will be erected as soon as the plans
ere ready and all the considerations in
volved have been settled satisfactorily.

The attraction at the Alcazar The
ater last night was the powerful play,
"The Middleman." by Henry Arthur
Jones. The cozy house was filled with
a delighted audience, which showed its
appreciation of the efforts of the cap
able stock company by repeated calls
before *the curtain after the close of
each act. John Craig, as Cyrus Blen
karn, inventor of the Tetlow pottery
were, holds the center of the stage
throughout. He gave a finished and
artistic characterization of the dreamer
who is suddenly awaked to tfce stern
realities of life and the cry for re
venge by the discovery of the shame
of his beloved daughter. Mary, brought
upon her by the son of the man who
had grown wealthy through his inven
tion. His prayer for revenge and the
discovery of the lost art were bits of
realism that stamped him as a true
artist. Luke Conness, as Joseph
Chandler, the capitalist and owner of
the porcelain works, was effective.
Harry S. Hilliard, as Julian Chandler,
was manly and convincing, and John
B. Maher made a hit as Jesse Pegg,
the lovesick workman. John Davies
was excellent as Batty Todd. Miss Lil
lian Lawrence, as Mary Blenkarn,
played the part with her usual charm,
and Miss Elizabeth Woodson, as her
sister. Xancy, was clever and scored a
success. The other parts were well
sustained. The piece is well staged.

SEAMEN HONOR
BIRTH OF ONION
Members of International
Organ ization Celebrate
Twentieth Anniversary
3IAXY MARCH IN PARADE
Hold Exercises in Lyric
Hall and Most Well Known
Labor Leaders Are Present
The twentieth anniversary of the or
ganization of the Sailors' Union of the
Pacific was celebrated in a befitting
manner last ni&ht by the members of
the International Seamen's Union of
America. Twenty years ago the union
was organized by a few men on Fol
som street dock, and now it has grown
to be one of the foremost organizations
in the labor field.
The event was observed by a parade
and exercises at Lyric Hall. The pa
rade was made up of the different
branches of the Seamen's Union, which
included the Pacific Coast Marine Fire
men's Union, Cooks' and Stewards' As
sociation of the Pacific Coast. Fisher
men's Protective Union, "Bay and
River Men of California and the mem
bers of thÂ» Sailors' Union.
More than a thousand men assem
bled at the headquarters of the Sallor3'
Union at Mission and East streets,
formed into line and marched down
East street to the Folsom-street dock
âthe place where the fathers of the or
ganization assembled and formed the
Sailors' Union. There three cheers
were given, whereupon the line coun
termarched and went out Market street
to Lvrlc Hall, where the exercises were
held.
The parade, as it marched along
Market street, nresented a striking ap
pearance. Stalwart men of the sea,
dressed in blue uniforms, with white
jackets, carried torches. Colored fire
works were sent into the air as the
line moved along.
At Lyric Hal! Walter Macarthur, ed- i
itor of the Coast Seamen's Journal,
acted as president of the evening and
made the opening address. He told in- â 
terestingly of the history of the organ
ization and its growth during the last
twenty years, predicting a bright fu
ture. Music was discoursed by a band,
and the Knickerbocker Quartet ren
dered several selections.
Other speakers who addressed the
gathering were: W. J. French, presi- j
dent of the Labor Council: A. O. Tveit- j
moe; R. Wisler, . secretary of the San :
Francisco Labor Council; H. W. Hut- '
ton; C. J. Harrington, vice president of
the International Seamen's Union of :
America; Thomas E. Zant and D. Me- |
Lennon.
All labor organizations are now mov- !
ing forward on the Japanese question.
It is the unanimous expression of all
that something should be done by the
Federal Government to include the Jap
in the exclusion act. At the last meet- I
ing of Machinists' Lodge No. 68 a
strong resolution was unanimously
passed urging the measure prohibiting
a genera! influx of the little brown men
into this country. After spending a
few weeks in this city studying the in- ;
tercets of tho International Brother- I
hood of Blacksmiths, Third Vice I
President James J. McDade has left
for the south. He was last heard from j
in Arizona looking after the interests i
of his association in that place.
President P. H. McCarthy, who has
returned from an extended Eastern
trip, is now on an official visit to Peta
luma, where his counsel is desired in
connection with matters appertaining
to members of the Building Trades
Council, which is affiliated with the
central body in this city.
A^ Mountain View on last Saturday 'â 
night a new local union was started i
with a good membership, and more ap- j
plications were left with the secretary
for action. The new local was set in i
motion by District Organizer John P. I
Horgan of this city. After the election !
and installation of newly made officers /;
8 banquet followed in honor of the
event.
A pleasant time was spent by the
local Journeymen Tailors' Union in So- i
cial Hall, Alcazar building, last night
upon which occasion the second annual
ball was held.

J C. STUBBS IS STllili

Liocal railroad circles were greatly
agitated yesterday over a report,
emanating from some mysterious
6ource, that J. C. Stubbs, director of j
traffic of the Harriman lines, had
signified his intention to retire at an
early date from his present respons
ible position.
The fact that a similar report was
in circulation when Director Stubbs
was here recently caused many yes
terday to believe that there might be
some truth In the story. Last night,
however, in an interview in Chicago,
Director Stubbs emphatically denied
the report and added that he had
made no statement that would give
rise to the idea that he had ever con
templated retiring.
CHEAT TALKS
OF REVIVALS
Eminent Clergy at Y. M. C. A.
Discuss Religious Fervor
Throughout the Country
PROGRAMME FOR TO-DAY
Divines to Speak at Four
Separate Places in City
Beginning This Morning
There was an immense gathering of
clergymen yesterday at the Young
Men's Christian Association when the
eminent divines who are conducting
the evangelistic revival in Oakland de
livered addresses on the work accom
plished in various cities.
The Rev. H. H. Bell, D. D., of the
United Presbyterian Church presided,
and with him on the platform were
the Rev. George W. White, pastor of
Central Methodist Episcopal Church,
and the Rev. J. S. Thomas, pastor of
Howard Presbyterian Church. Dr.
John Samuel Macintosh, president of
the San Francisco Theological Semin
ary, was first called upon to speak.
He gave a vivid description of the
recent revival in Los Angeles, which
was the greatest religious movement
he had ever witnessed.
Dr. Macintosh described it as a
whole hearted union of the Christian
forces of the city.
The results that followed were rriar
velous, for hundreds of men â men of
affairs, clerks and workingmen â truly
yielded themselves up to the Saviour.
The Rev. Charles Stelzle followed
with a few words in connection with
his special work among the working
men, he himself being a member of
the Machinists' Association, having
worked in the shops in New York
prior to becoming a clergyman.
Dr. Robert F. Coyle told of the re
markable revival in Denver, of the
presence of the Mayor of the city and
other prominent men at the meetings.
There the largest auditorium had been
crowded, theaters had to be hired,
and even then the meetings were
overflowed until the people, disap
pointed at not being able to obtain
admission, marched through the
streets. All grades of society and all
denominations, he said, were moved.
Strong men came to the platform,
throwing themselves on their knees,
some on their faces, calling on God
for mercy.
Dr. Coyle said it was not emotion
but a response of soul to the truth of
the Gospel. He described the march
of over 2000 people through the ten
derloin district singing hymns and
winning converts.
Dr. J. Wilbur Chapman, Rev. John
H. Elliott and Rev. Henry Ostrom also
spoke on revival and showed its power
for good in all the cities they had
visited.
There are to be meetings to-day in
San Francisco at which the evangelists
will speak. At 10 o'clock this morn
ing the first meeting will be held at
the Central Methodist Episcopal
Church, Mission street, between Sixth
and Seventh; at noon a mass meeting
at the Young Men's Christian Associa
tion, for "Busy Men and Women"; at
2:30 at Calvary Presbyterian Church,
Fillmore street, corner of Jackson,
and at 7:30 to-night at the First Pres
byterian Church, Post and Mason
streets.
The convention committee of the
Christian church met yesterday and
received glowing reports from the
East, showing that San Francisco may
prepare for a large assemblage of
delegates next August. The special
trains thus far have been named as
follows: The Chicago special will be
named: "The Christian Century"; the
St. Louis special, "The Christian
Evangelist," and the Pittsburg, "The
Christian Worker."
POLICE CAPTURE CHINESE
GAMBLING PARAPHERNALIA
Sergeant Cook Raids House Where
Mongolians Were Preparing to
Open for Business.
The police believe they upset the
plans of a Chinese gambling club as it
was about to open for business. Ser
geant Cook, with his squad of men,
raided the rooms on the top floor of a
building at 637 Jackson street and
c.iptured a gambling outfit. The pa
trol wagon was backed up against the
door and the outfit was carried away
to the Hall of Justice, where it will be
held as evidence.
The outfit contained packages of
blank lottery tickets which are used
In playing Chinese lottery. It is not
thought that any games had been run
ning at this place from the appear
ance of the rooms. It is thought that
the Mongolians were getting ready to
open for business in a few days.
Grocery Man Loses Sugar.
Henry Walking, the proprietor of a
grocery at 566 Fourth street, is minus
four sacks of sugar, which he had
just purchased yesterday and brought
to the front of his store in his de
livery wagon. Walking left his horse
standing in the street while he stepped
into his store. When he returned the
hrrse and wagon were gone. Thinking
that the animal had moved off on its
own account he searched about the
neighborhood without finding it. In
an hour or so two boys living in the
vicinity who found the horse and
wagon standing on Golden Gate ave
nue and Laguna street returned to
the store and gave an account of their
find. The sugar had disappeared from
its place. The supposition is that a
sneakthief saw a chance and drove
off with the wagon.
One trouble with many a self-made
man is that the part he talks with is
out of proportion to the part he
thinks with.

Palino, twenty-six years of age, was
taken to the home of Joseph Tavino
and introduced to the two women of
the household in the following fashion:
"Palino, these are my wives."
"I'll buy one," Palino replies.
Tavino assented. The money was
put on the table and Tavino left the
room feeling confident that Palino
would select the younger woman. Up
on his return he found Palino with his
arms around the elder woman's neck
while the latter was struggling to es
cape. "Here, let go," cried Tavino,
"That's my wife."
"So is thÂ« other," cried Palino.
"No, she's my sister-in-law, Just ar
rived from Italy, and I thought you
would choose her." answered the wife
broker.
"A bargain is a bargain," replied Pa
lino, "and I'll just take this one."
He attempted to drag Mrs. Tavino by
force. The husband interfered and a
general fight ensued. Mrs. Tavino
grabbed an ax, the husband a razor
and the sister-in-law a broom. Palino
took a flying leap through a window
on a third story, but lost part of his
ear, Tavino managing to make a skill
ful cut with the razor. Mr. and Mrs.
Tavino were arrested.

listen to the sweet voice of the popu
lar singer, whose marvelous vocal i
power was put to a severe test. Al- j
though the Palace court was not con- !
structed thirty years ago with any j
particular regard for acoustics, it was
demonstrated last evening that It is I
well adapted for concert purposes, for
Madame Tetrazzini's voice seemed to
reach the outermost parts of the palm
garden with a clearness that fairly
surprised many critics who were
among the auditors.
Her first rendition was Verdi's
"Caro Nome," from "Rigoletto," and
resulted in a demonstration of en
thusiasm that only ceased when she
reappeared on the balcony of the first
floor and sang an encore. Tosti's
"Serenata" was received in a similar
manner and an encore was demanded
before the vast audience would permit
I Madame Tetrazzini to retire. The pro
j gramme of the evening was given
under the direction of Louis E. Schoe
niger and was a great success through- '
out. At its conclusion Madame Tetraz
zini was the guest of Colonel J. C. i
| Kirkpatrick, manager of the hotel,
i who, in recognition of her generous j
.offer to sing, presented her with 'a j
handsome diamond necklace as a
token of appreciation.

Members of Senior Dramatic Club of
Santa Clara College Present Play
at Alhambra Theater.
"The Light Eternal" was splendidly
given last night at the Alhambra The
ater by the members of the Senior Dra
matic Club of Santa Clara College. A
large audience greeted the players and
much appreciation was shown for the
able manner in which they handled
their parts, as their acting displayed
all the indications of veterans.
Gerald P. Beaumont in the role of
Pancratius shows that he possesses
much dramatic talent, as his inter
pretation of the character was admir
able. John J. Ivancovich as Diocle
tian, Emperor of Rome, was very good
and his work was recognized by the
audience. George A. Casey and Wil
liam John did themselves justice in
their parts.

FRED E. MULLHOLAND
funny Shore, from the stable of
Jere Dunn, quoted at the mellow price
of SO to 1, came through at a bargain
â¢ale held In the mile and a furlong
selling event at Oakland yesterday.
The little Halma gelding begins. like
a summer zephyr and finishes like a
cyclone, and at the distance and in
the company looked to possess an un
u'niable chance. When the early in
vestors got through a thorough search
of the ring failed to disclose anything
better than 15 to 1. "Puss" Wright
had the mount on the outsider and he
â -â¢rtainly made no mistakes. Meister
f r.ger showed the way for a mile, then
unostentatiously retired. The Fretter
then looked a winner for a moment.
But he quit and it resolved down to a
be;wpv-n Flaunt and Sunny
, in which the latter came out
victorious by nearly a length in
. Sunny Slope, the dam of the
winner, was a famous race mare and
Â»Tte of her son appeared to be a
popular one.
Favorite players did not spend a
very pleasant afternoon. Of the six
public t hoices Glcndenning alone
earned brackets. Fine weather drew
-â¢ crowd.
'Big Bill" Knapj', on Mary F, favor
it for the t\vo-y< j ar-old dash at three
â¢. half furlong?, succeeded in get
.way from the barrier very poorly
and finished third. McÃride. with his
i ustomary alertness, shot out in the
lÂ«*ad with .wonalis. an s to 1 chance,
winning all the way. Isabeau. the
mount of Ltmn, ran second, less than
a length ahead of the favorite.
i/eleres with E. Walsh in the saddle
raj'tured the five-furlong scramble for
,^n three and four year olds. The
Alaxir. colt ruled a 6econd choice in the
snd won easing up from the T to
rorite Phalanx. Ethel Barrymore
i, red perceptibly after displaying aj
- turn of speed, running a good
third.
Everything seemed to favor Glen
denning. and the chestnut sprinter
d up a clever winner of the flve
\g selling run. Bell Reed was
rt turned sideways at the start by
FMmborough. and Sir Preston ran
ted f>n the rail for nearly a quar
a mile. All this time Glenden
had clear sailing and in front and
finished nearly three lenpths in ad
vance of Sir Preston at the wire. Bon
r.nally managed to land in the
â¢vith Bell Reed.
Well played at 3^ to 1, the mile and
yard selling affair turned out to
.y a pipe opener for Harry Beck.
McÃride hustled the old gelding into
the leading position early in the game,
and he breezed home ahead of Redwald
and Silurian. Rey Dare, ridden by
Bonner. was almost backed off the
boards, but failed to show any alarm
ing amount of speed.
Probably Downpatrick has been un
der estimated. In the betting on the
concluding mile purse run the three
year old's odds were hammered down
at the last from 10 to 414, and he was
ik < headed at any stage of the race.
-'.way defeated Toledo for place
honors. The latter home had first call
In the betting once, but later there
was a decided slump In his stock, 2^
to 1 going beggin. Squire Johnson,
the post favorite, ran well for six fur
longs, when he was done.

the meeting of the Western Jockey

according to schedule in their lo

As was expected, the licenses of all
jockeys and trainers now taking part
at Corrigan's track In New Orleans
were revoked, but no mention Is mad*

has been running his horses steadily at
Corrigan's track. McDowell, too, ran
a horse in his name and colors on th*
opening day. None of Corrigan s
horses, however, have started at his
new course. The most prominent among
Jockeys whose licenses were revoked
are Nicol, D. Austin, Troxler, Young.

Morrison, Jenkins and J. Hennessey.
Of the well-known trainers whose li
censes were revoked are found thÂ«
names of Pat Dunne. Pat CItIH, John

spring In connection with the famous
Poseur case, were reinstated, as was
also Jockey Willie Buchanan, who was
ruled off at Harlem in the summer of
1903. for the alleged mishandling of his
mount. Incubator.
Many other applications for the re
instatement of jockeys and trainers
were passed to the next meeting, in
April. The meeting was an unusually
quiet one and the stewards, who went
into session at noon, transacted a!l
business at hand before T o'clock in the
evening. Aside from the rulings men
tioned the rest of the work accom
plished was merely routine.

%EE TAYLOR UPSETS
DIGNITY OF COURT
In Reply to Superior Jndge Troutt's
Question She Says, "It's None of
Your Business."
Mias Bee Taylor, the former clerk
in the War Department at Washing
ton who was ousted for an attack on
the Philippine policy, again comes to
the front in* an attack on the authori
ties. This time the outburst occurred
in the court of Superior Judge Troutt.
The Judge asked Miss Taylor a ques
tion yesterday regarding a suit in
w*iich she is a litigant. She snappily
responded "None of your business "
The judicial dignity was visibiy
shocked.
The remark gave Bailiff Denny Sul
livan an opportunity for quelling an
incipient riot, and he responded with
alacrity. After a few words of cau
tion and reproof the case was set for
trial on next Thursday, stress being
laid on the time of hearing when the
information was conveyed to the
irascible Miss Taylor. She is suing
for a share In the estate of her uncle
Joseph D. Taylor.
Mrs. Squires' Fate Postponed.
Judge Cook has not yet allowed Mrs.
GrAce Squires, the woman burylar, to
go on" probation. The Judge had re
ceived an anonymous letter giving
four addresses where it was alleged
Mrs. Squires had lived and had borne
a bad reputation. A detective wag em
ployed to make an investigation and
found at two of the addresses that
the woman's reputation was good and
at the other two Mrs. Squires was
not known. That disposed of the
anonymous writer. As a few articles
stolen by the woman have not yet
bten returned to the owners, the
Judge continued the^case till to-day.
If these articles are returned the pro
bation order will probably be signed.
Knocked Down and Run Over.
CharleÃ IJower, twelve years of age.
living at 224 Fremont avenue, ran in
front of a cable car at Haigrht and
Stelner street* on Sunday afternoon.
He stopped to whistle for three other
boys, not observing a horse and buggy
that was being driven in the opposite
direction. He wan Btruck by the
horse, knocked down and the wheels
of the buggy passed over him. The
horse was driven by A. J. Johnson of
the cruiser Boston. The boy was car
ried to Dr. J. M. Stowell's offlce, 696
Haight street, for treatment. His
right ear was torn off and he was
.otherwise injured.
ALAMEDA SEEKS
SPACE AT SHOW
Commissioners Argue With
the State's Representatives
to the Portland Exposition
DISCUSSION PROLONGED
Proposition Is Made That
California Building May
Be Enlarged to Get Room
Alameda County wants space for a
county display in the California build- '
ing at the Lewis and Clark Exposition.
In a conference yesterday at the Com- I
migsiontr'B headquarters in the Palace j
Hotel, at which the Alameda County
Commissioners were present, the Call- ,
fornia Commissioners to the exposition ;
set forth that the commission saw no '
way, in view of the limited space the |
State building supplies for exhibition i
purposes, to -provide for anything but
a' collective State display with sec
tiorial representation therein.
The Alameda Commissoiners are ;
Wilber Walker, Theodore Gier and W.
H. Weilbye. They were also Commis
sioners for Alameda County at the St.
Louis Exposition. They met the state
ment of the California Commissioners
with tho propositic-n that Alameda
County would gladly provide sufficient
money for an addition to the California
building. Commissioner Weilbye said
that the California building has a yard.
It would be possible, in his opinion, to
fence in and roof over some of the
outside apace and make It an integral
part of the California building without
interfering with the Mission type of
architecture that has been adopWd.
The California Commissioners did not
wish, the State building having finally
been approved by the Governor, to
make any alterations in the building
plans.
Then the Alameda County Commis
sioners urged that no representation
was provided for the section imme
diately about San Francisco and Ala
meda County. The sectional subdivis
ions include the Sacramento Valley,
the San Joaquln Valley, the Sauthern
counties, the North Coast counties and
the Central Coast counties as indi
vidual units. San Francisco is not
doing anything to be represented. The
Alameda County Commissioners, so
said Mr. Weilbye, would be willing to
combine with San Francisco in the ex
hibition line. The California and Ala
meda County Commissioners talked
some hours and the ground was laid
fat a full understanding of the wishes
of Alameda County.

GRAND JURORS
ARE EXAMINED
Eppingers Challenge Panel
and Individual Members
for Bias and Prejudice
EFFORTS UNPROMISING
Motion Is Made to Set Aside
the Indictments on That
and Many Other Grounds
When Herman, Jacob and Joaua
Epplmjer and James Darnings ap
peared in Judge Lawlor's court yester
day to plead to the indictment charg
ing them with obtaining money by
false pretenses, motions to set aside
the Indictment were filed by Attorneys
Budd and Murphy on behalf of Her
man and Jacob Eppinger and by At
torney Pelxotto on behalf of Josua
Eppinger. No motion was made for
Demings, but it was agreed that his
case would stand on the same footing
ac the others.
The motions were made on the
grounds that the Indictment had not
boen found, indorsed and presented as
prescribed by Use Penal Code; that
the names of witnesses examined be
fore the Grand Jury or whose deposi
tions may have been read before it
wore not inserted at the foot of the
indictment nor indorsed thereon; that
a copy of the testimony given before
the Grand Jury was not delivered to
the defendants; that person or persons
were unlawfully permitted to be pres
ent during the sessions of the Grand
Jury when the charge was under con
sideration, and that there did exist and
now exists good grounds for a chal
lenge of the panel of the Grand Jury
and individual members of it.
The following members of the
Grand Jury were examined: T. P. An
drews, foreman: William V. Bryan,
Pfcretary; George A. New hall, P. F.
McCarthy, John H. Speck. H. J.
Cordes, John Porcher, William B.
Bundschu. Andrew M. Darts. D. H.
I.ohsen. John T. Sullivan, G. A. Hare,
K. J. Boires and Jamesa. Smith. The
attorneys for the defendants sought
to prove-that bias and prejudice exist
ed in thte mirrds of the grand Jurors
in filing the indictment, but they were
not successful. Newhall admitted that
at the time of the failure of the firm
he had expressed an opinion, but that
did not prevent him from acting fairly
and impartially.
Further evidence will be taken this
morning. Attorney J. C. Campbell was
present on behalf of the prosecution.
YOELI/S OLDEST DAUGHTER
HAS A BUSY DAY ON STAND
Attorney Hoefler, for the Contestant*.
Exhaustively Cross- Examines
Mrs. Evelyn A. LÂ«vy.
Mrs. Evelyn Amelia Levy spent all of
yesterday in Judge Kerrigan^ court
â  under the grilling cross-examination of
! Attorney Hoefler, counsel for the con
: testants. She was made to repeat in
detail the testimony given by her last
: Thursday, in which she told the his
tory of her father's business and social
relations. Many time* the attorney
sharply questioned Mrs. Levy with a
i view o! causing her to contradict her
self, but failed.
One thing Hoefler did establish, how
ever, was the fact that a feeling of
bitter animosity existed in the heart
; of Mrs. Lew toward heY sister-in-law.
She said also that her sister OÂ«nevieve
had attempted to estrange her father
and herself and that only by persistent
efforts could the witness prevent a sep
aration.
In describing her father's business
relations, Mrs. Levy said he felt
' ashamed of the dishonor attached to a
family whose debts were not paid. She
said her father declared that creditors
were cheated and that Mrs. Yoell kept
the names of creditors off the court
. list.
She then went on to describe how she
stepped between her father and her
sifter-in-law. Mrs. Dunn, at a time
when she was certain Mrs. Dunn was
going to strike her father. She also
told of her own impertinence to her
father, which, in his kindness, he later
forgave and forgot. When asked by
Attorney Hoefler why she was for
given, she said that her father found
j out that she was provoked to it by the
1 influence brought against her, and he
saw the circumstances In their true
light.

SENDS APPEAL
TO WASHINGTON
Citizens' Alliance Think*
Marine Engineers' Union
Does Not Obey the Laws
KILLNG IS REQUESTED
Organization of Mechanic*
Is Snid to Have a Power
Superior to Government
The Citisens' Alliance believes the
Marine Engineers' Union is exercising
an authority beyond that allowed by
law. Accordingly Herbert George has
dispatched the following communica
tion tf> the Secretary of Commerce and
Labor:
Your memorialist haÂ» the honor to present
I th* following facts respecting a potential re-
I straint and hindrance of commerce in coast
' and <JeÂ«p water shipping. The la* requires
that all marine engineers shall, after exam
; ination by the Federal Inspectors, receive the
! license of thÂ« Unite*! States to pursue their
! calling. Th* law requires that an applicant
for examination am * licensee shall present tbÂ«
| signatures of two Licensed engineers I* in-
I dorsement of his application.
. This proper and necessary law. restricting
[ marine engineering to the licensees of the Gov
| ernmÂ«nt.' li Intended to facilitate commerce,
and to enchance th- safety of Ufa and property
on the high seas and In other trade In ' which
' registered vessel* and boats are . employed.
* The license of thÂ« engineer confers an exclu-
I sive privilege upon Its holder. No one else, no
i matter what his skill and experience, lacking
: the Federal license, la permitted- to enter thÂ»
{ vocation of a marine engineer. MM the HcÂ«Â»n.->Â«
. confer* an exclusive privilege; It also Impose*
i an obligation upon the licensee.. He Is, in a
direct sense, the benetieiary and represÂ«sitativt
;of his Government. His license Is in the na
1 ture of an enlistment in â¢ service, from which
, others are excluded, ana in which he is to
: consider his obligation to hit employer and his
Government as paramount to all other obliga
tions whatsoever. As his license commands
respect, he must respect it when held by other
license*:.
RESTRICTS MEMBERSHIP.
Tour memorialist has the honor to repre
: sent that, by reason of a combination between
' j numerous licensed marine engineers in the sea-
I ports of the Pacific Coast, in the nature of an
\ exclusive union, other licensees are forbidden
i and deprived of the right to work at their
caning under their said licenses; that the said
union of licensed engineers, oy refusing to ad
mit <o Its membership other skillful and ll
wwed engineers, mill-lies the license of thÂ»
Federal Government, destroys its efficacy as â 
permit to follow the vocation of the marine
' : engineer, and asserts the superiority of the
permit of the Marine Engfneers* Union to thÂ«
license of the United States.
And your memorialist has the honor to
represent that the Said Marine Engineers'
Union. â¢by affiliation and federation with,
unions of firemen, stevedores, marine cookj and
waiters and sailors, is able to completely deny
employment to skillful and duly licensed ma
rine engineers not of its membership^ If such,
licensed engineer, being a non- member of this
union, secure employment on a ship, sailers,
firemen, tooks. waiters and sailors refuse their
duty, ana stevedores and longshoremen's unions
refuse to handle her cargo. Under this system
of affiliated - unions, â  the licensed engineer
refuses duty when enjoined to do so by hit
union's rules respecting a sympathetic strike.
By such means and such violation and mis
use of thÂ» rights acquired by th* license of
the United States, ships are subjected to Ones
by unions and combinations, their discharge
of cargo Is delayed, and commerce is re
strained and hindered.
CITES PRECEDENT.
Your memorialist asks that your department
take such steps as will protect commerce by
making- the Federal license of a marine engi
neer paramount, and what the law intended
it to be. his sole permit and warrant of right
to employment in his licensed vocation. and
that tie assertion or authority in a Marine
Engineers' . Union, superior to that of the
United States, shall be prevented by revoca
tion of ' the licenses of all engineers who asso
ciate - themselves) in such, union.
As a precedes* or the guidance at your .de
partment In considering this case, your memo
rialist has the honor to refer to synopsis of de
cisions of the Tsiasury Department for th.Â»
year ISyS. from No. 13.621 to 14,366, page
017. synopsis 14.205.
In that case the river pilots and the rapid*
pilots on the Upper Mississippi River, being
Federal licensees, formed federated unions. The
rapids pilots refused to take over the rapids
of the river any steamboat not . piloted by a
member of the River Pilots' Union. The mat
ter being referred to the Solicitor of the
Treasury, that efflcer decided that the fed
eration of these two unions, and the purpose
of each union separately, constituted In taw
a conspiracy to the hindrance of commerce,
"rendering' the officers who were parties to thÂ«
same justly liable to suspension, or dismissed
by revocation of their licenses, under section
4450. Revised Statutes, without any further
act of misconduct on their part."
â  Your memorialist begs to represent the
analogy between the two cases.- and prays that
you will take such coarse as will end the
assertion by th-Â» Marine Engineers' Union t.>
power and authority superior to that of tho
Government itself. ...

SAIL.OR TAKES HIS LIFE
IN ASYLUM IX STOCKTON
Victim of Many Shipwrecks Plans the
Deed With Remarkable
Cunning.
STOCKTON, March 6.â Alfredo
Mantovani, a sailor', sent to the Stock
ton Asylum last September from the
Marine Hospital in San Francisco,
committed suicide Saturday night by
hanging himself in his bedroom. He
planned and executed the deed with
remarkable cunning. Between rounds
of the attendants he put his shirt over
the grating of the door, and then tied
about his waist a sack of sand used in
polishing the oiled floors. The rope
used to drag: the sand about, he then
tied to tho window bars, stood upon
the sill, pulled the shade down be
hind his back and jumned off.
Mantovani was thirty-eight years of
age and leaves a wife and child in
Italy. The many shipwrecks which he
experienced brought about his con
dition.
NEVADA SENATE OPPOSES

RENO, March 6. â By a majority of
one vote to-day the Senate repealed
the midnight saloon closing law, a

SAYS BRIBERS
ARE AT WORK
Colorado Senator Claims
He Was Given Money to
Vote for Alva Adams
SPKINGS A SENSATION
â¦
Postmaster of Denver and
Railroad Official Said to
Have Handled the Cash
DENVER, March 6. â A committee
was appointed to-day by the General
Assembly of Colorado to investigate
charges of bribery in the contest for
the Governorship. Charges have been
made and published in the local news
papers to the effect that a fund had
been raised by corporations and was
being used to purchase votes for James
H. Peabody, who seeks the office held
by Alva Adams, but no notice of them
was taken by the General Assembly.
To-day immediately after the Joint
convention, which is hearing argu
ments in the contest, was called to
order, Senator R. W. Morgan (Re
publican) of Boulder strode down the
aisle, holding aloft a paper, which he
handed to the presiding officer and
which was read to the Assembly by a
clerk at the request of the writer. The
communication was as follows:
To Jesse T. McDonald, President of the Sen
ate and Presiding Officer of the Joint Conven
tion of the Fifteenth General Assembly â Sir:
1 have to Inform you that on the 2d day of
March, 1906, one James M. Herbert and Dan
iel Sulllvon offered and promised to pay the
undersigned tho sum ol one thousand five hun
dred dollars to vote for the Hon. Alva Adams
for Governor In the contest now pending- be
fore this joint convention. Of the sum said
James M. Herbert paid the aum of seven hun
dred and fifty dollars. This money I have
given to George Stldger, District Attorney lor
the city and county uf Denver, for his official
use. 1 have also grtven to him such informa
tion as he requires in his official capacity. . I
also destre to lay the matter before the people
of the State, the Senate and the Joint con
vention, as It affects the question now pend
ing before this convention.
R. W. MORGAN.
Silence fell upon the joint conven
tion for several minutes after the
reading of Senator Morgan's state
ment. Then Representative J. B.
O'Connell, a Democrat, expressed sur
prise that the members of the Re
publican majority apparently did not
propose to take any action on the
charges and he moved that a com
mittee of five be appointed by the
chair to make a thorough investiga
tion of the whole matter and report
before a vote is taken in the contest.
After brief debate, in which several
Republicans joined in the demand for
an investigation, the motion was
unanimously carried.
James M. Herbert, whom Senator
Morgan charged with having given
him $750 as a bribe, is vice president
and general manager of the Colorado
and Southern Railroad and stands in
the foremost ranks of railroad officials
ir. the United States. Daniel Sulli
van, who is accused by the Senator of
having offered the alleged bribe, is
postmaster of Cripple Creek and one
of the most prominent Republican
workers in the State.
Eight informations charging bribery
and conspiracy were filed against Her
bert and Sullivan in the criminal court
by District Attorney George M. Stid
ger almost simultaneously with the
springing of the sensation in the joint
convention by Senator Morgan. Bonds
of $5000 each were furnished by the
accused.
This afternoon Postmaster Sullivan
assaulted Richard Broad, a Peabody
worker, on the street, striking him in
the face with his fist. Several by
standers interfered, preventing further
hostilities. Sullivan says that Broad
and other lobbyists instigated Morgan
to make the charges for the purpose
of influencing legislators in favor of
Peabody and denies that there is any
truth in Morgan's statement.

lag do disposition to speculate In thÂ« article
notwithstanding the extreme low range of
prcoss and the undoubted strength of the sta-

they are not concentrated and holders seem to
be too anxious to get rid of what they have
to try to get any advantage in the way of
better prices out of the enlarged requirements

NEW TORS. March 6. â Wall street main-
JalneJ to-day ilie more conservative attitude
toward speculation which â¢a at assumed last
w^ek as th*! result of Eliarp -reactions in prices
ar.d the mariifeft diypofiition of holders to un
load on the hiÂ«h*r Sights which prices took
before the reaction. The handing down of a
decision by the Supreme Court on the In
junction against the distribution of Northern
Securities assets stirred the market, but even
that potent subject -as of moderate effect
Â«-omparÂ«yi the frenzied movements -which
have followed the suggestion and - expectation
of a decision in the past. There was come
revival of activity ac&in In the stocks imme
diately effected -a-hen the definite character of
the deeiflon became better understood. . The
bfarir.g of the deciEion of the respective Inter
ests of the parties to the contest has been
lÃ.rge!y modified by the progress of events in
the stock market. Ths Union Pacific conten
tion against the receipt of portions of both thÂ«
Great Northern and Northern Pacific stocks in
place of the Northern Pacific holdings flrst
' contributed to the merrer was on the ground
that this plan would represent a large discrep
ancy la the valuation of assets a* compared
with lv original holdings. The great enhance
ment In market valuations which has since oc
curred has gone far to settle this contention.
The action of the market reflected the feeling
that the potentiality of the subject as a mar
ket Utotor was largely exhausted.
Foreign markets again took the view that
Russian reverses tended to bring peace near
er; and a strengthening effect on securities
wÂ»a the result. Our own market started off
with a considerable show of strength, but the
?weigM of oHerings to be absorbed on the ad
vance became effectively manifest at onoe.
Sues points of strength a-Â« developed after
ward were flue to special causes. Railroad
trafflo officials reported their only embarrass
ment to be the finding of sufficient cars to
take oar* of offered traffic. Money on call
â¢ fell to a, lower quotation notwithstanding the
* poor haak ttatÂ«Â»m*rt of Saturday, and foreign
' exchange declined In response to relaxing for
eign niOMT markets. The languid temper nt
the ?peculation reasserted itself in the late
tr.arket and prices yielded easily, making a
fcÂ«*vy cicalas. '- - r.
Ths bond market was duller and rather
heavy- Total sale*, per valve. M 300.000.
TTKlted States bonds were %II unchanged on
call.

COWBELL'S DIN DRIVES
MAN TO DESPERATION
HE TRIES TO RAZE HIS
NEIGHBOR'S HOME.
â¦
Wielding of Ax Leads to Court
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
W: x. heavily bearded and
of stolid mien, declared that he did
not bring hie ax Iftto play until he
had exhausted both suasion and
thrÂ»fi:Â«. Instead of giving him court
eous turning; However, Mrs. Jane
Dodge, hw next-door neighbor on
Twenty-set ond avenu*. between X and
L atreetÃ. Sunset district, scoffed at
him. and the bell attached to her
COWa neck jangled more loudly and
â¢'grly than ever. His slum
ber was murdered by the interminable
and maybe the insanity born
of insomnia had something to do with
his desperate resolve to chop down
the Dodge dwelling. At any rate,
when he began to hack at the humble
abode h~ felt that his act was justified.
The Misses Annie* and Teenle Faix.
sister? of AVilliam, corroborated his
statements as to the dementia-pro
ducing effect of the cowbell. On the
night of the chopping. Miss Annie
nverred. "Brother Bill" dropped on his
knees and with clasped hands raised
supplicatingly requested Mrs. Dodge
r to muffle the bell or to remove
it from the cow during the nocturnal
hours. Miss Teenie appreciated the
ulterior motive of the bell-ringing at
unseemly hours. The plain truth of
the matter was that the Dodges
â¢ oveted the lot upon which the Faix
home stood and were systematically '
endeavoring to force the Falxs to va
tt. Miss Annie added that the
bell -ringing was only one feature of
the annoyance visited on her and hers
by tÂ£e Dodges, as while she was plant
ing vegetables in her garden Mrs.
Dodge 6at upon the dividing fence and
made hideous faces at her. It was
Miss Teenies opinion that the cow
had been trained to walk around the
Faix cottage all night long and to
shake its head so as to keep the
braxen clamor going. Nor was Mis?
Annie surprised that "Bill" committed
the chopping for which he was ar
rested. Indeed she wbuld not have
been Rstonished if he had truried his
ax in the brain of the cow, which,
by the by. was a very elusive animal.
Unlike good little children, it would
be heard, but not seen.
John Dodge, son of the complaining
witness, denied that the noise made
by the bell was as harsh or as loud
f.s the defense alleged. Furthermore,
8o frightened were the Dodges by the
threats of "Bill" Faix that he (John)
had loaded his shotgun and awaited
the personal attack which he believed
â was inevitable.
Mrs. Foux. also residing in the dis
turbed district, heard the thuds of Mr.
Faix's ax ac he swung it against the
Dodge abode, and also saw splinters
f..\. She begged "Bill" to abstain
from killing Mrs. Dodge.
Then to Police Judge Fritz was Im
ps rted the information that Mr. Faix
had recently appeared a* complain
ant against Mrs. Dodge in the court
of Judge Cabaniss. the lady being ac
cuÂ»e*l of disturbing the peace, and
that one outcome of that squabble
Â»as the erection of a very tall fence
between the two homes by the owner
of the one occupied by the Faixes.
Pn His Honor continued the case of
podpe v=. Faix till next Friday, by
which time he will probably have
ascertained whether the defendant Is
deserving of Imprisonment or mere
reprimand.

"X^r." George Hiree, with hair and '
hat and frock coat a la Buffalo Bill, |
and Alfred Bell, devoid of plctures
quenees, were arrested for vociferously
berating each other and thereby dis
turbing thÂ« peace at Kearny and Pine
streets, to the huge entertainment of a
rrowd that blocked traffic. "Dr.**

his "Celebrated Magic Gipsy Remedy,"

offered for sale, and it was the vituper
ative effort of each gentleman to dis
credit the other's declarations that
constituted the peace disturbance.
â¢Dr." Hirze testified that ten years
ago he began selling his cure-all at
Kearny and Pine streets, popularly
known ac "Fakirs' Corner," and that
he nightly held forth there for eight
consecutive years, when he left the
city in response to the clamor of ailing
rurallsts in all parts of California.
Several days ago, when he returned
from a tour that conveyed relief to in
numerable sufferers, he found his old
stand in pessession of Mr. Bell. Noth
ing daunted, however, the "doctor"
erected his portable pharmacy and re
sumed the harangue that had never
failed to win an auditory. Nor did it
then fall. So magnetic- was it that
the throng surrounding Mr. Bell quick
ly nocked to the "doctor." whereupon
Mr. Bell indulged in uncomplimentary,
rot to say libeloue, allusions to the
"Gipsy Remedy." Retaliation in kind
led to the arrests.
Judge Cabaniss cautioned berth de
fendants and then dismissed them.
Police Captain Duke was attired in
off-duty parb Sunday afternoon when
Fred Lathe accosted him at Kearny
and Bush streets with these words:
"Say, you're a spry-looking mug;
let's have a quarter."
Instead of complying with Mr.
Lathe's modest demand the captain
took him car riding to the Hall of Jus
tice and to-day Judge Mogan will
sentence him for begging.

Bruno Hock borrowed C. Schumas
ser's ?4 watch on pretext that he had
obtained a situation as timekeeper, but
his real motive was to pawn the ticker
and appropriate the cash proceeds to
his own use, for doing which he was
arrested and charged with petty lar
ceny.
"So you wanted to keep time, hey?"
said Judge Conlan, with fine sarcasm,
to Mr. Hock.
"Well. I did keep time, didn't I?"
was the smiling response.
"Thirty days for perpetrating such
an awful joke." was the court's decree.
Charlie Chung, queueless and radi
ant In an emerald sweater, told Judge
Megan that "dlinkee no good," by
which he intended to convey the im
pression that he regretted the slip into
inebriety which resulted in his arrest
for disturbing the peace. It was the
first time he had ever imbibed to ex
cess, he said, for he was a Christian,
as was his better half, who was Miss
Fannie Watson when he led her to the
altar twenty-eight years ago. Their
esght children are also of the Christian
faith and the two that died in In
fancy were formally baptized by a
Christian clergyman. The family
home, at 726 Washington street, is
noted for its Christian orderliness, and
he. as the head of the family, would
require all his Christian charity to for
give the heathen who had shamed his
face by tempting him to drink deeply
of spirituous liquor.
"Didn't you drink intoxicants at all
prior to the overloading in question?"
asked the Judge.
"No muchee â dlinkee 11*1, like him
an' you," replied Charlie Chung, nod
ding rapidly toward Patrolman Mills
and then toward the bench.
Several members of the Chinatown
squad testified that the defendant was
"a decent Chink" and three of his
half-breed sons were good citizens and
regular voters. The first born, Willie
operates an express wagon, in which
vocation his sire Is also engaged. Case

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALU, TUESDAY, MARCH 7. 1905.
BOARD DESIRES
TO BUY LANDS
Supervisors Seek Offers of
Sites for Improvements
and Will Sell More Bonds
POUXDMASTER RESIGNS
Irwin Gives Up Fight and
Society Is to Eun Institu
tion for Impounding Dogs
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
authorized the City Attorney to solicit
offers for the sale of all lands required
for school purposes and for the new
County Jail and addition to the Hall
of Justice under the bond issue. In
the event of failure to receive offers'
to sell within the appraised valuation
fixed by the City Engineer, then con
demnation proceedings to acquire the
lands will be commenced.
An ordinance was passed to print,
fixing May 1, 1905, as the date for
the filing of bids for sewer bonds to
the amount of $443,600, and school
bonds amounting to $427,000.
The offer of Henry Mulvlhill to sell
a lot on B street, near Fourteenth
avenue, for the Golden Gate Park and
Presidio Extension for $900 was ac
cepted and a demand for the amount
was drawn in his favor. .
The board confirmed the purchase
by tne Board of Education of block
No. 3 in the Mission and Thirtieth
Streets Extension for $5600, the cost
to b? paid out of the proceeds of the
sales of school bonds.
It was decided to dispense with the
inspection of elevators in the City
Hall and Hall of Justice and devote
the funds to repair work.
The board ordered demands filed by
ex-Poundmaster Irwin, aggregating
$4608 85, and those of the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals
for $1239 60 to be paid. The society
was employed a year ago by the board
to conduct the pound and Irwin, the
Mayor's appointee, was dispossessed
of his office. The Superior Court con
firmed the action of the board and the
society will proceed at once to im
pound stray animals, Irwin having
agreed to resign as Poundmaster. The
Mayor said he will approve the bond
of the society.
The Mayor was authorized to sell at
auction ten horses condemned by the
Fire Department.
The southerly half of Fifteenth
street, opposite the termination of
Sharon street, was ordered to be paved
with bitumen.
The following ordinances were
finally passed:
Fixing the width of sidewalks on
California street, between Presidio
and Thirty-third avenues at fifteen
feet.
Ordering the construction of a con
crete parapet from the beach to the
Cliff House at a cost of $4500.
DEMANDS PARK
BE RESTORED
City Sues Ejectment of Many
Residents From Franklin
Square and for Damages
City Attorney Long yesterday began
suit for ejectment and damages on be
half of the city against the Spring Val
ley Water Company, the Union Trust
Company and several other co-defend
ants. The complaint alleges that the
defendants are unlawfully occupying
Franklin Square, bounded by Bryant,
Hampshire, Sixteenth and Seventeenth
streets, which, it is alleged, is city
ground. The damages are placed at
$50,006 for withholding property and
$24,000 additional for value of rents that
have accrued. The defendants have
occupied the land since March 11. iBSB.
Recently the Park Commissioners de
cided that they had funds enough to
proceed with the improvement of the
square and discovered that it was al
ready occupied. They immediately re
quested the City Attorney to institute
proceedings of ejectment preparatory
to beginning work.
The Spring Valley Water Company's
claim, it is said, is based on its pur
chase of a reservoir from John Bens
ley, who conducted a waterworks,
which he later sold to the .city. It is
alleged by the city that Bensley merely
had "squatter's rights" to the land and
that his sale to the water company
does not affect the city's rights. The
reservoir has been abandoned and the
land has since been used by the Spring
Valley for the purpose of rental.
The others included in the suit who
are occupying and renting on the dis
puted square are Winifred Bergen and
Catherine Halmar. John Hass and
Michael O'Donnell. The land was set
aside for a park under trie Van Ness
ordinance of 1858.
son by "exhibiting a deadly weapon in
a rude and threatening manner,"
Arthur Newman was before Judge Mo
gan. The weapon in question was an
antiquated military firearm, alleged to
have been in active service against
Senta Anna, and the prosecution de
clared that it was aimed by Mr. New
man at Master Bartoni while the lat
ter was loitering in propinquity to the
Newman chicken-house on Delaware
avenue, between San Jose and Ocean
avenues, Ingleside district. The de
fense protested that the weapon was
not deadly, inasmuch as it was incap
able of being fired, and that therefore
the complaint was defective. The relic
of a turbulent past will be produced
In court to-day and on its serviceable
ness depends to some extent the court's
finding.
A. L. Nesbitt alleged he was drunk
when William H. Wheeler robbed him
of $30 in a Fifth-street barroom, and
A. L. Nesbit was drunk when he ap
peared before Judge Mogan to testify.
His manner was rude and he insisted
on interrupting the witnesses under
examination, each interruption being
prefaced with "Now, lookee here,
kid." When the court sternly admon
ished him to maintain silence he said
"Now, lookee here, Judge, be a good
fellow," and to his undisguised aston
ishment he was promptly ordered into
custody, with instructions that he be
kept there until he is sober.
When the energetic Bailiff Hickey
summoned Tim Sullivan to step forth
from the cage and confront Judge Mo
gan on the charge of drunkenness
three men in various stages of un
kemptness promptly responded. After
considerable difficulty the particular
Timothy Sullivan wanted was picked
out and quickly disposed of and then
the other two were taken one at a
time and treated as their respective
cases demanded. Inquiry, by the bailiff
developed the fact that the incarcera
tion of the three namesakes was not
in the nature of a family reunion, as
they met for the first time in the cage.

SELECTS PUBLIC
LIBRARY SITE
Board Adopts a Resolution
Ordering the Purchase of
Western Addition Block 73
MAYOR MAKES PROMISE
Saye He Will Give Supervis
ors Notice if He Decides
to Suspend the Auditor
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
adopted a resolution providing for the
selection of Western Addition block 73
as a site for the new Public Library
to be erected under the bond Issue.
The resolution follows:
Whereas, Proceeds of the sal* of library
bonds to the amount of $739,800 ar* now avail
able for the purchase of a site for the Now
Publlo Library and the commencement of the
construction of the building thereon: and
Whereas, The Board of Publio LJbrary
Trustees recommends the selection of "WeatÂ«rn
Addition block No. 73, bounded by Van Ness
avenue, Hayes, Franklin and Fell â¢treeU, as
tie most desirable site therÂ»for
Resolved, That said Western Addition block
No. 73 be and thÂ« same is hereby selected as
the lite whereon to erect the New Publlo
Library authorised by tha bond issue for pub
llo Improvement*
Further resolved. That the City Attornay bÂ«
and ha is hereby authorised and instructed to
solicit offers for the sale to tbe city and coun
ty of San Francisco of said block and to re
port the result thereof to tha Board of Super
visor*.
Remarks In opposition to block 73
were made by A. G. Magulre, Dr.
Charles Maguire and P. A. Breen, who
argued that the business interests of
Hayes street would suffer if a public
library Is erected on the street. R.
Aubrey Jones, agent for some of tha
owners of block 67, thought "that site
is preferable to block 73.
SITE IS FAVORED.
Rev. Father Allen of St. Ignatius
Church urged the selection of block
73, saying that his congregation of 5000
favored the site.
"We are certainly entitled to some
consideration." said Father Allen. "We
have been here for fifty years and have
paid taxes during all that time. We
do not think that this board should
refuse to select the site because for
sooth a few butchers and saloon
keepers are opposed to it."
Thomas Magee was asked if sur
rounding property would be Increased
in value by the erection of a libraryi
but the question waa withdrawn when
A. G. Maguire asked Magee what com
mission he was receiving for the sale
of block 73 to the city.
Mrs. Edward C. Wright, president of
the Century Club, and Mrs. Sorbier of
the Outdoor Art League spoke In favor
of block 73. Public Library Trustee
Taylor said that from the vigorous ob
jection manifested to the site It would
look as if a pesthouse were to be
erected instead of a fine library, which,
he said, would appreciate instead of de
preciate values of surrounding prop
erty." J. D. Phelan told of the plans
drawn by Architect D. H. Burnham for
a civic center on behalf of the Adorn
ment Association. The vote on' the
resolution was:
Ayes â Bent, Booth, Braunhaft,
Comte, Connor, D'Ancona, Gallagher,
Hocks, McClellan, Payot, Rea, Rock,
Sanderson â 13.
â  Noesâ Alpers, Boxton, Eggers. Lun
stedtâ4.
Excused â B ran dens tetn â 1.
The site has been offered for $659,
000, but it is estimated that it can be
had for $647,000, the amount of the
appraisement.
TO PREVENT DEFICITS.
The board adopted a resolution di
recting heads of city departments to
file monthly statements of expendi
tures in order that they may be con
fined to the provisions of the one
twelfth clause of the charter and pre
vent deficits In the fund before the
end of the fiscal year. D'Ancona
said that it is the habit of some de
partments to incur bills in one month
which, however, are not presented for
payment until two or three months
later, and that the credit of the city
is liable to become impaired owing to
an accumulation of such bills.
The Committee on Artificial Lights
was requested to prepare an ordinance
requiring all persons, companies and
corporations furnishing gas and elec
tric light to the city and county of
San Francisco, or the inhabitants
thereof, in the future, to erect poles
for gas and electric street lamps of a
kind and character to be designated
in the proposed ordinance, in order
that the street lamps of this city may
be of a uniform and artistic char
acter.
ANTICIPATE SUSPENSION.
An attempt was made to force the
hand of Mayor Schmitz, who gave
Auditor Baehr one week in which to
reimburse the city for the amounts
covered by audited demands for
Grand Jury expenses, under pain ot
suspension. Supervisor d'Ancona said
that the board should meet in special
session to indorse or override the
Mayor's threatened suspension ot
Baehr. D'Ancona suggested 10 o'clock
this morning as the time for the meet
ing, but this was opposed by Super
visor Gallagher, who said It would be
undignified to meet before the Mayor
had taken action.
"This board has no right to antici
pate my action," said Mayor Schmitz,
"I intended to have . a consultation
with Mr. Baehr this afternoon, but
the meeting of the board prevented it.
I will say that if the Auditor refuses
to comply with my demand I will
follow the provisions of the charter
in any proceedings looking to his
suspension. I will say that if I de
cide to take such action I will give
the board twenty-four hours' notice
in order that a meeting may be called
at once."
This was - satisfactory to the mem
bers of the board, which thereupon
adjourned to the call of the chair.
Sues to Break Sister's Will
Louise Bee yesterday filed a peti
tion against George S. Hoover to have
the will. of her sister, Marie E. Hoover,
set aside on the grounds of mental
ir.competency and undue influence.
The testatrix left $17,000 and valuable
real estate to her husband and friends
and cut off her sister and her sister's
child with $1 each. The plaintiff al
leges that Mrs. Hoover sold a valu
able piece of property at the corner of
Stockton and O'Farrell streets to Matt
I. Sullivan for a consideration of .$lO
and bases her claims of mental in
competency on the transaction.

WITTMAN'S FATE
STILL IN DOUBT
Commissioners Examine More
Witnesses and Continue
Case Till This Evening
GAMBLING HAS STOPPED
Special Policeman Says He
Heard Chinaman Give Sig
nal of Warning to Ellis
The case of Chief of Police Wlttman.
charged with neglect o* duty and ln
competency, was resumed before the
Board of Police Commissioners yester
day afternoon. The testimony intro
duced during the session had little
bearing: on the charges preferred
against tha accused official and the
bulk of the witnesses emphasized only
thÂ« well known fact that since Ser
geant Cook took charge of affairs in
the heathen quarter, gambling has been
suppressed and the clubs closed. The
prosecution will require about two
more sessions to complete Its testi
mony. These sessions will be held this
evening and to-morrow night. On
Thursday night the defense will pre
sent its case.
Oaptain of Police Thomas F. Duke,
whose district comprises Chinatown,
testified he had received no orders rela
tive to the surpression of gambling In
that stction. He has charge only of
uniformed policemen and he claimed
that inasmuch as a special squad is
detailed for that particular purpose the
Interference of outsiders would do more
harm than good. Duke served In
Chinatown on several occasions and
admitted it was a difficult matter to
stamp out gaming.
James Downey, a special policeman,
delivered a hard blow to Sergeant El
lis, who confessed before the Grand
Jury to having taken bribes. Downey
Stated about the middle of November
he was standing on a corner with Ellis.
when a Chinese came up and informed
the latter that Chief Wittman was In
Chinatown. Ellis immediately asked
his informer if he had told the other
Chinese and when told that only a few
of the heathens had been warned, El
lis became excited immediately and
went away hurriedly, rubbing his
hands.
Sergeant Jesse B. Cook, who has suc
ceeded in suppressing gambling, and
to whom tht- Chinese attribute super
natural powers, was the next witness
called. He said his method was to
clean all the gambling houses out as
quickly as he found them occupied.
Cook admitted that two years ago,
when he was detailed to Chinatown, he
requested Chief Wlttman to remove
him. but his superior refused to do so
until ill health made It necessary.
The remainder of the witnesses.
Sergeants Brophy and Trayer, Detec
tive George McMahon, Watchmen
James Lambert and J. W. Alsot and
Guides Tim O'Neill, Henry Jacobson,
George F. Hemings, John W. Lemmon,
Charles Burnstein, John W. Hinch and
William Gallagher, all testified to the
fact that since Cook has been In the
district gambling has ceased. The case
was put over until this evening at 7:30
o'clock and the cases of Sergeant
Frayer and Brophy were set for Friday
night.
PATROL WAGON DRIVERS
MAY LOSE POSITIONS
Police Board Is Said to Be Oontem-
plntinff the Dismissal of Eight
Rein Holders.
The Board of Police Commissioners
is reported as about to lop off the
heads of eight of the present patrol
wagon drivers to make room for some
of the Schmitz administration friends.
Much concern is felt by those who now
hold the reins on the police wagons.
The present head-lopping bee is sched
uled to take place soon after the trial
of Wittman is finished.
As far as it can the Police Board !
Intends fo exercise its power in dis- !
missing present employes of the de- ;
partment and appointing friends of the
administration to the vacated posi- |
tions. The patrol drivers under the
charter are civil service employes, but ]
these men have so far successfully
evaded the taking of the Civil Service '
Board's examinations through the pro
curing of an injunction against the !
board. Twice in the last two years j
has the Civil Service Commission at- â 
tempted to hold these examination and ;
each time a restraining order has been :
obtained by the patrol drivers from j
the courts. The job is a fat one. pay
ing $90 a month. No money is spent
on uniforms, so that the salary. In con
trast to the policeman's, is clear
money. ,

Who will win? That is the ques
tion that is worrying the fire and
police departments these days. The
baseball game to be played next Sun
day at Recreation Park between the
teams of the two departments is as
suming the proportions of a cham

will be In as good shape as hard daily
practice can make them.
Lieutenant Michael Joseph Conboy

Booked on Two Charges.
Donald McFadden and Walter Ay
hens were booked at the City Prison
yesterday by Detectives Graham and
Harrison on charges of burglary and
grand larceny. They are accused of
stealing sixty hides valued at $400
from Krenz Brothers' tannery on Six
teenth avenue on March 1. They stole
a horse and wagon to carry the hides
to a barn on Osage alley, where the
hides were later recovered. The horse
belonged to Florian Andreas, a
rancher, but the police have been
unable to find an owner for the
wagon.

Plan to Stop "Roasts"
Dr. James W. Ward, president of the
Board of Health, Mayor Schmita and
Dr. J. L Stephen, Chief Surgeon of thÂ«
Emergency Hospitals, held a consulta
tion Saturday night with a view to
placing restrictions on the newsgath
erers of the city dailies. Smarting un
der the sting of the many exposures of
misconduct in office, these three city
Officers considered the advisability of
excluding the press from the hospitals
run under the municipal government,
and thus preventing reports of alleged
grafting methods from gaining publi
city in the pape rg
Dr. Stephen has been for some tlmÂ«
complaining of the distressing article*
published regarding the lax and Im
proper methods employed by him and
some of his associates in the hospital
service. At Ward's suggestion a meet-
Ing was arranged with the Mayor.
The three aspirants for long life In
the money-getting municipal posts
quietly sought out the rooms of the
Board of Health last Saturday night,
and under the lowered gas lights tried
to adopt a plan whereby the nuisance
of newspaper "roasts" could be done
away with without incurring too much
the displeasure of the press. When the
Issue came up for discussion Stephen,
who has at divers times and places
said that as soon as the newspapers
exposed bis methods he would throw
them from the hospitals, showed the
white feather and weakened on te final
vote. Schmitz and Ward favored ex
cluding the newspaper men, but Ste
phen, fearing the publication of more
of his peculiar methods in office. Â»aid
that he "guessed that the press had
better have one more chance." It waa
decided to let matter* rest as they
