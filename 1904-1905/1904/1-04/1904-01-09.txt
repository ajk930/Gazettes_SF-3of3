Opening of Campaign for Delegates
Awaits Pleasure of National
Committee Chairman.
Mr. Roosevelt's friends are compelled
to regard Senator Hanna's failure to
issue the call as use of the machinery
of the party against him. Meantime
attacks are being made on the Presi
dent all along the line In the hope of
creating a strong sentiment against
him.
INDIANAPOLIS, Jan. 8.â The In
dianapolis postofnee has been flooded
with marked copies of the Cincinnati
Commercial Tribune condemning in the
strongest terms the administration of
President Roosevelt and declaring
against his nomination at the national
convention. Copies of papers contain
ing editorials booming Hanna for the
Presidency have been mailed. The pa
pcjrs are sent to almost every State in
-thÂ«e Union. In addition to these papers
ut, least 10,000 letters containing small
julmphlets tending to show that Cthe
s**itiniL-nt in Indiana is for Hanna for
;hie Presidency have been mailed.
Prominent Republicans of the city and
Stsae are puzzled and have taken steps
to trace the mailer. Officers in the post
*4*2ce say they do roÂ£ know where the
papers and pamphlets came from.
Senator Hanna still controls the na
tional committee. When he arrived in
St. Louis in 1Â£36 he discovered that Hc
.Kinley lacked fifty-eight votes of
enough to nominate. The national com
mittee sat night and day deciding con
tested seats and when it got through
there was no question about McKin
ley'a nomination.
Delegates chosen in aQvance of the
â¢promulgation of the call might be se
lected in some manner not in accord
Avith the letter and spirit of the call;
therefore their selection might be
illegal. The party has for generations
discouraged the election of delgates in
advance of the publication of the call,
and it has been the custom to make the
call public at the earliest possible mo
ment. The greatest delay that has
taken place heretofore was in 18S8 and
then it was only the delay of one day;
but now it is pointed out that Senator
Hanna and Secretary Heath have had
twenty-seven days to ponder over the
wording of the call and still they are
not ready to issue it.
CONTROLS THE COMMITTEE.
The formal call is usually issued the
day the committee adjourns, because
un.til this call goes forth no steps can
l>e taken fcr the calling of State and
Congressional district conventions for
the election of delegates. The reason
for this 5s that the national committee'
is the central body and the call must
state the manner of choosing delegates
and the ratio of representation.
CALL BUREAU. 1406 G STREET, N.
TV., WASHINGTON, Jan. 8.â President
lloosevelt's friends regard with growjng
suspicion the delay of Senator Hanna
aad Perry Heath as chairman and sec
retary of the Republican National Com
mittee in issuing the call for the na
lional convention, and are growing
lirmer in the belief previously expressed
that Senator Hanna intends to try to
defeat Mr. Roosevelt's nomination- In
consequence the tension between the
Roosevelt and Hanna camps is getting
tighter. The question is no longer asked
' !n Presidential circles, "Will Hanna
run Roosevelt's campaign?" It is now,
"Win Hanna declare himself a candi
date - since' h<? is determined that he
'sficfTTjF regarded as an" anti-Roosevelt
man?"
In party tactics the failure of Chair
ir.an Hanna and Secretary Heath to
issue the call for the convention is very
important. ' Twenty-seven days have
elapsed since the Republican National
Committee met in the Arlington Hotel
in this city and decided to* have the
convention called to meet on June 21 in
Chicago. v
DELAY IS UNPRECEDENTED.
Erecial Dispatch to The Call
The extent of any further fight to be
conducted against the confirmation of
General Wood depends, it was stated
by Democratic leaders to-day, entirely
upon the attitude of Senator Hanna.
If Hanna will make the Wood case a
personal matter and pursue the fight to
a finish. Senators Gorman and Cat
mack will stand by him to the end.

N. W., WASHINGTON. Jan. 8. â Ene
mies of the administration and oppo
nents of General Leonard Wood's con
firmation to be major general are
making, much to-night of a scrap of
General James Wilson's testimony be
fore, the committee, which has just
been made public. General Wilson
argued with sreat earnestness against
General Wood's promotion and said
every officer in the army resented it.
Wilson went on to tell the committee
of an interview he had with President
Roosevelt at his home in Oyster Bay
after he had been elected Vice Pres
ident, but before he became President.
"He began," said General Wilson,
according, to the printed copy of tha
testimony, â"in. rusher extravagant
terms of praise of General Wood,
whereupon I said to him: 'Governor
Roosevelt, I think you are perhaps
mistaken about that If I am correct
ly informed. General Wood never wa3
under fire in his life until the Spanish
War began, either in the Geronimo
campaign or at any other time. In
the Spanish war he was never in but
one battle and that at Las Quasimas,
where, but for his rescue and support
by colored troops, he would have been
badly handled.'
" 'Oh, yea,* said Mr. Roosevelt, 'ha
was at San Juan,* to which I replied:
'I beg your pardon; he wa3 not. You
know that he was in the rear looking
for ammunition.' ' '/."*
" 'Yes.' said Mr. Roosevelt, 'but do
not tell anybody.*
"Now, why he did not want me to
tell anybody I do not know. I did not
pursue the subject any further, antÂ»
that is the last word that has. ever
passed between us with reference to
General Wood."

GEXOA, Jan. 8. â When it became known that the Niasin and Kasaga, warships built here
for the Argentine Republic and purchased by Japan, would, depart to-night^ there was great ex
citement throughout the town and crowds flocked to the harbor to bid farewell to the ships, of
whose strength and speed they are justly proud. An especial interest centers in the warships, topV
because half of their crews will be' Italians and ; because the engines-are entirely of Genoese con*
struction. ' '.'. '[ ''Â¦"Â¦ ,â¢ ' r .. "'
Contrary to what has been asserted the Niasin and Kasaga have kept the Japanese colors
hoisted from the moment they were turned over to the Japanese authorities. The vessels are com
manded by two Englishmen, Captain Boyle and Captain Lee, and the other officers also" are
English, with the exception o"f five Japanese. The ere ws,' numbering. 300 men to each ship, are
libout equally divided between Italian and English nationality. One hundred and twenty English
artillerymen embarked on the vessels last night. '
â¢ The commanders of the Niasin and Kasaga have received sealed orders, which will be opened
or. the sea. At the last moment the departure of the warships was delayed to await the receipt of
money from the Japanese legation in London, but it is expected the vessels will sail before
morning.
On board each warship the utmost gayety prevailed and the crews were extremely impatient
for sailing orders. "The Japanese officers were particularly jubilant, and swore by their ships and
by all their gods that no Russian should ever set foot in their country.

WASHINGTON*. Jam 8. â Though negotiated twenty years ago by Admiral Shufeldt, the
State Department officials say the treaty referred to by the Korean Minister in Paris has never
been invoked by the Government of that country. Its provisions contemplated that when any
of the powers treated Korea unjustly the good offices of the United States might be offered
with a view to an amicable adjustment of the controversy. * -Officials say. that if any request comes
from Korea for a. practical application of the terms of^the treaty it very properly will be given
consideration by this Government. Its provisions, however, are regarded as impractical of en
forcement and the necessity for its existence has been superseded by the establishment of The
Hague triixinaL \ '- \ " Â¦ ' Â¦ . \ Â¦ .. - : . . â¢:Â£,
PARIS, Jan. 8. â Miri YuengTchan, the Korean Minister, said to-day that he would not
l>e surprised should Korea appeal to the United. States for good offices in her -behalf in case of
the invasion of Korean territory by one or the other, powers. Under the treaty between the
United States and Korea this is permissible. Moreover, continued the Minister, the people of
Korea regarded the United States in a most friendly way, because of its faithful policy and owing
lo the fact that the first country to sign a treaty with the "Hermit Kingdom" was the United
States. . . ' - .
"Russia does not want war," added the Minister, "and the Japanese Government does not
want war, but the Japanese people, I fear, will force a conflict. The attitude of Korea has not been
disclosed, but my idea is that it will do all in its power. to save its territory from invasion and
to preserve strict neutrality. During the war between China and Japan Korea was interested and
consequently raised no objection to the passage of JapaiffcSe troops through the kingdom. But
a different situation faces the Government to-day. Korea- is not interested in the dispute between
Japan and Russia antf her people have no desire to ally themselves with Japan, which would fol
low should permission be given tor Japanese troops to operate in or from Korea.
"I have made no protest to the powers against the , landing of an American guard for the
legation at Seoul. Probably if war occur all the nations wilfland men for the same purpose."
It is affirmed at # tne Japanese legation that the reports that Japan has sent troops to Korea
are wholly unfounded, and that the Japanese Government continues to do its utmost for the main

"At its .'meeting the Cabinet to-day had under consideration the Russian reply. It is re
; ported- the matter will *be further discussed. I wish to emphasize, however, that it would be im
prudent to assume that this delay makes for peace. The Japanese press asserts that the Musco

ships and troops to China. Only one French ship is under instructions to proceed to the Far East.
Recognizing the situation as dangerous, there is talk in official and diplomatic circles of the advisability of
separate or Joint mediation by the powers that desire peace .in the Far East. It is said this could properly be
done in accordance with The Hague convention without giving offense to either Russia or Japan.
The semi-official Temps expresses the view prevailing by calling attention to the fact that Great Britain,
France,^ the United States and Germany are all interested. in the maintenance of peace, urging that to prevent
efforts at friendly intervention by saying that one power or the other would become offended is contrary to the
interests of the governments and of humanity. . â¢ . . .

ln of official assurances, voiced by Kcuter, as to the satisfactory nature of the Russian
reply, it is merely a repetition of the statement sent out by a doubtless well-meaning representa
live of an American agency weeks ago to the effect that Russia's fust, answer would be perfectly
satisfactory to Japan â a rash assertion which has been contradicted by every event since. 'It was
replied to by Japan voting an unlimited credit for war. So now Reuters assertion that Russia's

into the. region of the .War Office, which yesterday gave hasty and extensive orders to the Alex

Russian troops arc being hurried along the Siberian Railway, while yesterday, although the bourse

Meanwhile the diplomatic corps is all in a quandary to know what, to say in reply to the de
mands of their various Governments for reports upon the situation. M. Bompard, the French
representative, who is supposed to know more than the others, was appealed to yesterday simul

say she had her life Insured before

her relatives to suspect foul play arid

brought up Mrs. Ferslow with great
pride referred to the fact that three of

i telling her story to the authorities. She
j expressed herself with great volubility
j and related the story of the punish
! ment meted out to the child in a busi
ness-like manner without a trace of
nervousness or feeling.
Her statement is to the effect that
the baby, which she says is the lllegiti
j mate child of her daughter, was un
cleanly In his habits, and that contin
ued whippings and other forms of pun
ishment failed to have any effect upon
him. "I once heard of a woman in Chi
cago," said Mrs. Ferslow, "who put
mustard on her child to break It of bad
habits, but I thought that punishment
too severe and decided to try the hot
stove. I warned the baby of the pun
ishment I intended for him, and on last
Sunday determined to try it. Mr. Ta
kain and myself first placed our hands
on the stove and found that the heat
was only slightly uncomfortable. I then
j placed the child on the stove Just for a
moment, without any intention of burn-
Ing him severely. It is my impression
that owing to the fact that the lid was
not on the stove at the time we placed
our hands on it and was afterward put
on '\e embers were fanr.eC to a
blaze and heated the stove more than I
thought."
XO AFFECTION* FOR CHILD.
Mrs. Ferslow declares that when she
saw the "boy was burned she applied
cooking soda and water to allay the
pain. She admits, that she does not
bear the greatest feeling of affection
for the baby owing to Its illegitimacy,
and speaks of her daughter with no
kindness. The little girl. Blossom, Bhe
states is not her child, but refuses to
give the names of its parents, although
it is- understood that the little one's
name is Violet Taylor and that her
mother resides in this city.

SEATTLE, Jan. Câ The police of
Seattle believe that Mrs. Harry E. Oldt
did not jump overboard from . the
steamer Queen December 5. carrying
her little daughter with her to death.
They have for a month been working
oh the' theory that she quietly slipped
ashore when the Queen reached Vic
toria and made her way eastward over
the Canadian Pacific. Two weeks ago
her husband prepared papers in a suit
against Dr. J. Eugene Jordan of this
city for the alleged alienation of his
wife's affections. These papers were
filed in the Superior Court to-day with
a demand for $50,000 damages.
Meanwhile Dr. Jordan enlisted the
aid of local detectives. It is said, to
have been ascertained that Mrs. Oldt
left the Queen at 5 o'clock on the after
noon of December 5 at Victoria and at
,5:30 o'clock boarded another steamer
for Vancouver, taking her little girl
along.
Her valise, filled with clothing, and
the dress she had been seen to wear
on the Queen were, found in her state
room, leading to the belief that she
had jumped overboard in her night
wear, but an inspector on the dock at
Victoria is said to have furnished evi
dence that a woman carrying a big
bundle and leading a little girl left the
Queen after all the other passengers
were ashore.
Local detectives claim the woman
traveled to Vancouver, thence* to St.
Paul, under the name of Mrs. Treagan.
From St. Paul they think they have
traced her to Springfield. Mo., the home
of her parents. The motive for her
conduct if this theory is correct Is
shrouded in mystery. Oldt declares he
believes she is dead. Dr. Jordan refuses
to discuss the matter. It was necessary
for her to appear to have committed
suicide in order to carry out a carefully
planned conspiracy.

Rev. Mr. Takain. in making his com
plaint, stated that Mrs. Ferslow was
in the habit of beating the child, and
on last Sunday morning, while in his
room, was startled by screams coming
from the kitchen. He rushed to the
scene ar.d found Mrs. Ferslow holding
rhr boy on the stove. He immediately
CTabbed the child from the woman and
told her he would not allow such prac
tices. H<? told several of his country
men about the matter several days
later and they advised him that it was
Ijis duty to report the affair to the au
thorities.
Mrs. Fei-Flow and the two children
residing wth her, Harold, aged 2 years,
and Blossom, a four-year-old child,
â¢were taken to the Hall of Justice last
right. The woman was booked on a
charge of cruelty to children. Baby
Harold is a handsome, well-nourished
child and sat on Matron Casey's lap in
th- dormitory, contentedly munchinp a
cracker. Biossom, the other child, did
not show any traces of neglect, and
both of the children were suitably
clothed.
Mrs. Ferslow, who is a woman 40
An unparalleled tale of cruelty came
to light through the arrest of Mrs.
Victoria Ferslow last night by Officer
McMurray and Secretary White of the
Society for Prevention "of Cruelty to
Children.
Because her two-year-old grandchild
Harold soiled his clothe* this woman
removed the garments of the child last
Sunday and placed him on a red-hot
kitchen Ftove. The delicate flesh of
Baby Harold was frightfully seared by
Impact with the hot metal and a scar
he will bear with him to the grave
resulted.
With an air of nonchalance, this un
naturaJ woman admit? that she is re
sponsible for the baby's burns, and in
extenuation of her inhuman conduct
states that she was unaware that the
ttove was eo hot. Fire seems to be a
favorite method of punishment with
her. as on another occasion, according
to her own statement, she burned an
other child's fingers against a hot lamp
chimney because the little one had
placed some cotton stuff over the lamp.
â¢ Yesterday afternoon Rev. A. Takain.
an Armenian Christian minister, who
has been employed by Mrs. Ferslow
at her home. 711 Graf ton avenue, doc
toring sick cats and dogg, reported the
matter to Secretary White. A warrant
wes immediately secured and the ar
rest followed. Takain was in the em
ploy of the woman under arrest for
pome tjme. ar.d it is understood that
his reason In not reporting the matter
sooner was due to a fear that he would
fr"t into trouble with the authorities.
Mrs. Fctsl'iT.-, who is well known to
tho Society for the Prevention of Cru
elty to Children, conducts an establish
ment at the addrtss given, where, ac
cording to Secretary White, many dogs.
sore-Â«Â»yed cat*, invalid chickens and
homeless Â¦waifs are cared for. She for
merly lived on a small avenue off
Twenty-fourth street, and the society,
tfpon investigating complaints received,
found that two children, together with
dogs, cats and chickens, inhabited one
room. The children were taken from
her at that time, but subsequently re
turned and the removal to the Gra'ton
avenue residence followed.
STARTLED BY SCREAMS.
"I cannot understand why -Mrs. Wise
should have telegraphed to the police
here that her daughter's death was
suspicious, unless it was that she was
excited on hearing of her daughter's
death and had not previously learned
of her Illness," .
"Dr. E. J. Wemple, who attended Mrs.
Hume, certified that Bright's disease
was the cause of death. Dr. Wemple
stated yesterday that he had had Mrs.
Hume under his care from December
2J5 to last Tuesday, and scouted any
Idea that the woman died from any but
natural causes. Mrs. Hume was 27
years old. No further investigation
will be made by the police.
"We all came to California about the
same time," said Beale, "and Mrs.
Hume was a very sick woman. She
had been in the doctors' hands in the
East. She asked all of us not to let
her mother know of her illness. When
Mrs. Hume died I at once telegraphed
her mother, Mrs. Wise, In Toledo,
Ohio. A number of " telegrams passed
between us. Mrs. Wise wanted me to
bring the body to Toledo, but I could
not afford the money. I finally wired
her that the body would be cremated,
but I received no reply to my message.
I paid for the cremation and have sent
Mrs. Hume's trunk and her life insur
ance policy for $250*0 to her mother.
The policy was in favor of. Mrs.
Hume's mother.
BEALE MAKES STATEMENT.
Detective Cody was at once placed
on the case and he made a careful
and thorough investigation. It was
learned that Mrs. Hume formerly re
sided ir% Buffalo and came out here for
her health. She sold her rooming house
in Buffalo and intended to locate in
California.
Mr. and Mrs. A. Boswell, also from
the East, came out with Mrs. Hume,
and they stated to Cody that Mrs.
Hume was very ill on the trip.
E. M. Beale, a young man from Buf
falo, who is with his mother and his
sister at 1414 Post street, was a close
frle.nd^of the dead woman. .Beale in
formed Detective Cody that Mrs. Hume
was separated from her husband and
expected to secure a divorce. In that
case she and Beale were to have been
married.
Yesterday morning the body of Mrs.
Hume was cremated at the Odd Fel
lows' Cemetery. At about the same
time the death notices from the. Health
Office reached the Coroner's office and
the attaches were surprised to find the
name of Mrs/Hume in the list.
The Coroner's office knew that the
police were seeking Information of Mrs.
Hume's death and at once notified
Chief Wittman. Then it was learned
that the woman's body had been cre
mated but an hour earlier. * '
CARELESS HEAI/TH OFFICIALS.
The'clerks in the Health *Offlce took
the name over the telephone as that of
"Eubie" and watched for a death cer
tificate in that name.
On Thursday afternoon the death
certificate of Mrs. X*. C. Hume was pre
sented by an undertaker and a permit
for cremation was issued.
Investigation by the police of the
death of Mrs. L. C. Hume of Buffalo,
N. Y.,. who died last Tuesday at the
Clara Barton Hospital in this city,
proves that there was no foundation
for suspicion that the woman's demise
was from other than natural causes.
Last Wednesday Chief of Police Witt
man received a telegram from the
mother of Mrs. Hume from Toledo,
Ohio, stating that her daughter's death
was suspicious and asking that the
same be investgiated. Mrs. Matilda,
Wise, the mother of Mrs. Hume, also
requested that the body be held sub
ject to' shipment to Toledo.
i Carelessness on the part of Detective
Anthony and officials of the Health
Office resulted jn some excitement yes
terday in police circles and for a time
rumors were around that Mrs. Hume
had been murdered.
'Anthony was detailed last Wednes
day to locate Mrs. Hume or E. M.
Beale in this city, and to find out
whether the woman had died. No rec
ord was found at the Coroner's office
and Anthony claims that he simply
telephoned to the Health Office and re
quested that if a certificate of the death
of Mrs. Hume was presented tp refuse
a permit for burial and to notify the
Coroner. *

Calmly Asserts She Became
Tired of Correcting Little One
and Decided on Brutal Method
Tillman charged that the opposition
to an investigation was characterized
by partisanship. There was an appar
ent attejnpt at Congressional smother
ing. He did not see how honest men
could stand up in the face of House
sentiment and try to prevent an inves
tigation and allow the statute of limi
tations to "prevent the prosecution of
the rascals."
Dolliver said that he had read the
Bristow report and had found no
charge that Heath needed investigat
ing. Tiliman started to read the refer
ences to Heath, and while looking for
the place said caustically:
â¢"Well, if he was not besmirched by
the report he was tattooed â he is a
tattooed man."
The discussion was participated in by
Burrows. Dolliver and Quarles on the
Republican side and Carmack, Tillman
and Teller on the Democratic side. The
Republican contention was that there
had been a thorough investigation by
the Postoffice Departrr.enf7*and that a
Senate investigation was now being
pressed by the Democrats for partisan
purposes. The Democrats insisted that
they wanted the facts, and charged
that the Republicans were trying to
smother them. Perry S. Heath was bit
terly assailed and former Postmaster
General Smith was criticized by Demo
cratic Senators.
Platt of Connecticut criticized the
Democrats for their failure to express
one genuine, hearty word of praise for
the President, the Postmaster General
and the Fourth Assistant Postmaster
General for the good work which had
been done.
WASHINGTON. Jan. S.â Alleged
postofflce frauds were under discussion
in the Senate to-day, the subject being
opened in a Â«Â»t speech by Simmons of
North Carolina, who insisted there
should .be an investigation by the Sen
ate into the charges. Platt of Connec
ticut denied that the Republicans were
trying to cover up any wrongdoing in
the Postoffice Department, and said
they simply were contending that the
Postofnee Committee should ascertain
what was to be investigated.

that the present . arrangement between France and Great Britain wde such that it could not be disturbed* and
that even if Korea and China should join Japan they would not be looked upon as powers within the meaning of

as yet been attempted. While the mil

In case the stablemen are insistent
in their demands on the stable owners
and a lockout is the result, the men
will go out without the sanction of the
San Francisco Labor Council. This is
the result of the action taken by the
Labor Council last night when the
majority report of the executive com
mittee was adopted. The majority
recommended that the men work the
extra hour, provided they are paid for
it, and that they assist In loading and
unloading hay. It advised, however,
that the men refuse to handle manure.
The verbal report of the minority ad
vised that the men insist on their de
mands being granted, in full. After a
long discussion the majority report
was adopted.
There has been a slight trouble be

Special Dispatch to The Call.
ST. LOUIS. Jan. *.â Notice was
n*Â»rved on the management of seven
theaters in St. Louis to-day by License
Collector Clifford that their licenses
wen* revoked and that they would be
required to procure new licenses,
based on certificates from the Build
ing Commissioner's office that they
had complied with the city ordinances
in the 'matter of safeguards against
fire before being allowed to continue
giving performances. The theater
upon which the notices,' were sÂ»erved
were the Olympic, the Century, the
Grand. f the ' Columbia,!' Havlin's,. the
Imperial and the Odegn.. \onf was
Forvod on the managers of the Htantl
ard, Crawford's or Music Hall.
Willard Sayles. a former usher at the
Iroquois. testified that the exits on the
north side cf the theater were always
closed. They caught with a spring
lock and during his time at the theater
hÂ» had never seen any of them open.
As far as he knew, none of the ushers
had any instruction concerning action
In case of fire.
Gilbert McLean, one of the stage
hands, who had been in the theater
since its opening, swore that he had
never known of any protection provid
ing against fire, with the exception of
some tubes of fire extinguishers. No
instructions had ever been given, as
far as he knew, as to the duties of em
ployes in & fire or a panic.
H. D. LaughMn testified that he had
eeats in the first row of the second bal
oony and that the balcony was so
crowded that numbers of women were
and fitting in the aisles, mak
ing it difficult for him to reach his seat.
He declared that the Jnn<>r doors of the
?-xits opened Inward instead of out, but
when questioned closely by Coroner
Traeger declared he was not sure about
it.
CrflCAGO. Jan. S. â At the Coroner's
inquest over the victims of the Iroquois
fire to-day the most important witness
was Engineer Murray of the theater,
Â¦whose testimony showed that the thea
ter was practically destitute of protec
tion against fire; that no precautions
had been taken and no instructions had
*ver bepn givpn to any of the attaches.
Two more names were added to-day
to the list of victims of the fire, Nellie
Danson. T> years of age. and Estelle
Muir, 31 years of age. died in hospitals.
The deaths to-day make a total of
EÂ£6 fatalities due to the fire.
Robert E. Murray, stationary engin
eer of the. theater, testifying at the in
quest to-day, declared that there was
one stendpipe on the stage, two in the
basement and one in the fmoking
room. There was no hose attached to
any of them, although there was hose
in the building on a rr-el. and nobody
had evrr been instructed how to use it.
The hose in the building consisted of
cne coil and was locked in the smok
ing-room at the front of the building.
The only way in which an alarm could
reach the Fire Department was by use
of the telephone.
Madeline Dupont. one of the girls in
the double oct^t. which was on the
Ftage at the time the fire broke out.
\*as positive in her statement that the
curtain which was lowered was the as
bestos curtain. She was emphatic In
her evidence that the curtain which
was lowered did not burn. She became
badly tangk-d in the latter part of her
evidence and finally admitted that she
did not know whether or not there was
an asbestos curtain In the theater, but
supposed there was.
Edith Williams, another member of
the double octet, who fainted on the
stage at the outset of the fire, was
called and nearly fainted again, fall
ing against thr> ttand and rolling to the
floor before t-he could be caught. She
was removed from the courtroom and
did nut testify.
Captain Pendleton, commandant of
the Washington "navy yard, who is
arguing for a J4.000.0W appropriation
to enlarge the gunshops of the Wash
ington yard, to-day called attention
to the fact that the Government would
save $600,000 on the 6000 tons of armor
which the Midvale people were to
make. This was given as an Illustra
tion of what might be saved in gun
construction by allowing increased fa
cilities In the Government's factory.
Captain Pendleton said that the Car
negie and Bethlehem companies had
made money enough during the first
five years they jvere engaged in the
manufacture of armor for the Govern
ment to pay for their plants. He also
asserted that In the manufacture of
guns the Government would produce
for 52,000,000 what It would have to
pay $2,500,000 for under contract.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 8.â The recent
ly awarded contract for 16.000 tons of
armor plate by the Secretary of the
Navy, 6000 tons of which is to be made
by the MIdvale Company and 5000 tons
each by the Bethlehem and Carnegie
companies, has been the subject Â«f some
comment before the House Committee
on Naval Affairs during the hearing
relative to the naval appropriation bill.
Rear Admiral O'Neill, chief of the
Bureau of Ordnance of the Navy De
partment, has stated that evidently
there was a combination or under
standing between the Carnegie and
Bethlehem companies, as their bids
were the same.
The general, current of the debate
divided on party lines, though ques
tions propounded by Senators Spooner
and Heyburn, both Republicans, show
ed they entertained some doubts as
to the legality of .Buchanan's acts at
Panama until he* was confirmed as
Minister bv the Senate. .-
Cullom. Lodge and Fairbanks touk
the position that the President had the
right to nominate a Minister to Pana
ma, notwithstanding the fact that no
such office previously existed. They
claimed, however, that Buchanan was
not acting as a Minister, and that the
President had not constituted him as
such. He was, they said, merely a
personal representative of the Presi
dent, dispatched to- Panama. on a dip
lomatic mission and responsible alone
to the President. A precedent fdr this
action was cited in the case of Blount,
who was sent to Hawaii by President
Cleveland, and whose authority was
paramount, notwithstanding the fact
that an American Minister was at
Honolulu exercising diplomatic func
tions.
j The point was raised by the Demo
crats that the positidn to which Bu
chanan was nominated was not in ex
istence when the appointment was
made, and that the President had no
right to create the position, except with
the consent of the Senate. The Demo
crats who, supported this position were
Morgan, Bacon, Bailey. Pettus' and
Blackburn- The 'Republican Senators
almost unanimously -supported the ac
tion of the President. ""* They declared
he acted wholly '.within his constitu
tional prerogatives: -The principal ar
guments on that side of the question
were made by Lodge, Cullom, McCo
mas, Speoner. Fairbanks and Allison.
No decision was reached, and it was
agreed that the question-would be con
sidered again on Monday.
The status of Buchanan, who is now
at Panama acting virtually as Minis
ter of the United States, was discussed
at length. Senators Bacon and Bailey
in their speeches argued that the Presi
dent either usurped the functions of the
Senate by dispatching a Minister to
Panama whose nomination had not
been. confirmed or had sent Buchanan
there as an envoy, or commissioner,
without color of law. They held that,
as the Senate was in session," the Presi
dent lawfully could not send a Minis
ter to a foreign country without the
advice and consent of the Senate.
- DEFEND THE PRESIDENT.
In an executive session of the Senate
tu-day the nomination of .W. I. Bu
chanan to be Minister to Panama was
discussed formore' than two'hours, the
debate being confined almost entirely
to the constitutional right of the Presi
dent to appoint a' Minister to the new
republic without the co-operation of the
Senate. - . Â¦ â¢ r
Scott said : that; .although he had al
ways believed In 'a sea level waterway,
he had -hesitated ; to. press the matter
because he might be accused of an effort
j to delay arid hinder the* construction
yt a canal, but .such was not his pur-
I pose. He wanted a canal, but wanted
| the best one. He asked that the Com
j mittee on Interoceanic Cables make an
j early report upon the. resolution ' he
i had presented, f. , " ,

WASHINGTQN, Jan. 8.â The Senate

continued consideration of the Panama

ventlon. - It became .apparent during
the debate -that suggestions for altera
tions of the treaty would, not be.con

When the Senate met to-day Scott of

Hill then took up the question of
reciprocity with Canada, and strong
ly urged the necessity of such action.
He referred to the people of Canada
as the "folks who live north of us
and wear our coats, and people who
wear our coats are good commercially,
because they usually pay their debts."
He referred to the Panama canal as
a good thing for a man who had an
appetite for bananas. He would like
it built, and it might do some good,
but it would not help the people of the
North much, even though they did
pay part of the expense of building it.
Suddenly Hill, in his brusque man
ner, broke off and began to talk about
restraint, and that was the keynote
of his brief talk. He said:
A great many people think that the buÂ«lneÂ«Â»
of a railroad 1* to restrain trade. 1 want to
a*5ur<? you that a railroad that restrains trade
will so broke. A railway to be successful
mu*t make it possible for the people to develop
the natural resources of the country with profit
or Utmi railroad will be wiped off the fate of
the earth. If a man does not prosper he can
move, tut a railroad is there and must stay.
S^otne reference has be*n made to-night to the
building of erapirÂ»Â«, and It is only a week ago
that I wa.s railed an empire builder and a
arfamtr of Oriental dreams. I want to re
mar* in i-assir.c that some of those dreams
have come true. Your prosperity has been
more mar,kÂ«?<l in the last few years than any
time during the twenty that have gone by. with
the possible exception of the golden era of Cali
fornia. Will it continue for the next five
years? That's a qu^tlcn you have got to con
sider. The great State of Minnesota has Its
natural resources, and the ones which we have
been mostly dependent on hare a limit to their
rapacity. The iron mines are limlKed and the
trees of oar one- majestic forests are counted.
You have enly the toll and Its possible prod
ucts IÂ»rt. and on that you must build your
foundation fcr future success.
Probably the most important address,"
one which commanded the closest at
tention, was that of President J. J.
Hill of the Great Northern Railway.
Hill introduced his remarks by calling
attention to the contrast between the
present and the* future; of what
growth and success had come to the
Twin Cities, and said:
The Northern Pacific Railway hag bÂ«Â«n cne
cf tho moft Important e!emÂ«ntÂ« In this fucceeÂ«
and tha: of the preat empire of the Northwest.
Mr. Elliott, the seventh captain of this ship,
has srown up with the West. He knows what
the West needs antl what will advance ltÂ« in
tere*ts. . :
For half an hour Elliott and Presi
dent Smith of the club were kept busy
shaking hands, and later Elliott was
the central object of a number of
speeches of welcome from prominent
business men. To all of these he re
sponded in an earnest manner by a
carefully prepared address in which he
spoke hopefully of the future of the
Northwest and the Northern Pacific
Railway as one of the essentials to
that success.
ST. PAUL. Jan. 8.â Howard Elliott,
president of the Northern Pacific Rail
way, was tendered a reception in the
parlors of the Commercial Club to
night, thus making his formal entry
into the business life of St. Paul. About
200 business men of St. Paul were pres
ent and a large delegation from the
Minneapolis Commercial Club joined
in the welcome to the new president of
the Northern Pacific.
It was a hard story Mrs. Beekwith
told the court in her complaint. Po
tatoes and onions were about all that
she had had to eat for some time, while
her husband pursued his vocation in
Alaska. She said to-day she thought
he had left her for good. Then she
brought the action for divorce on the
ground of failure to provide. Beek
with heard of the suit and started for
Oakland. He was snowed in on the
Yukon and shipwrecked off St. Mich
ael, but he persevered and arrived in
time. â¢/â¢ Â¦ Â¦ "
The suit, after the required length or
time had passed, had neared the day
of hearing. A default Judgment had
been allowed and the Court Commis
sioner had the matter in hand when
Beekwith arrived. He first secured a
lawyer and had the default judgment
set aside and the case was repoenei
and set for trial. Then he scrtieht out
his wife and won h*r affections again,
with the result that the suit has been
dismissed.
Harvey Beekwith, an Alaskan miner
who traveled 3000 mile3 through snow
and sleet, braving the perils of ship
wreck to answer a suit for dlvcrrce
brought against him. succeeded In get
ting bis wife to reconsider, and she
filed a voluntary dismissal of the suit
to-day, and the affairs of the Beekwith
Lousehold have once more resumed the
tenor of happier days.

While Lin Fung was being doctored

row will say: Retail trade has been
some,what slow to recover from holiday
dullness, partly because of the bad
weather, which also retarded collections
to some extent. Traffic was impeded
and shipments of merchandise delayed.
On the other, hand low temperatures
stimulated the demand for seasonable
goods, and burdensome stocks in the
hands of dealers were reduced.
Jobbers and manufacturers in those
lines received supplementary orders
and the wool market became firmer In
tone although actual sales did not in
crease materially. Mills and factories
report irregular conditions, some in
dustries opening the new year under
very favorable auspices, while other
branches are extremely auiet.
In the leading manufacturing: Indus-'
try the year opens with quiet conditions
as to demand, but much irregularity in
the matter of wages. Numerous reduc
tions went into effect and several oth
er? are contemplated. During the last
quarter net earnings for "the leading
producers were less than half those of
the corresponding months of ,1902 and
similarly unsatisfactory exhibits were
â¢made by other concerns. These official

The annual meeting of the. Semper
virens Club of California' will take
place this afternoon at 2 o'clock in
the conservatory of the Palace Hotel;
The reports of the various officers will
be read, the constitution will be sub
mitted-for approval and adoption arid
the election of officers will follow. An
address, "The Protection of the For
ests," will be delivered by John Mc-
Naught, after which theje will be a
discussion.
Will Discuss the Forest?.
"I would not," said the District At
torney, "ask a Jury to return a verdict
of guilty against a man under any cir
cumstances unless I believed such a
verdict to be in the interest of Justice.".
The court, therefore, on motion of the
District Attorney, entered a nolle,
which cleared the docket of cases"
against Dietrich and Fisher. â¢
District Attorney Summers said after
court adjourned: "Officially "this office
has nothing to say â the court has set- '
tied the -matter. . If Senator I Dietrich :
wished to secure a vindication through
a trial of the case on its merits he had
an oportunity to do so by not raising
the technical point of whether or not
he was a member of Congress from" the
time of his election to his taking "of the
oath of office."
The District Attorney stated to the
court that the Government had not,
within his knowledge, ever placed a
man on trial on what might be termed
a technical violation of the law. He
said that under the construction placed
upon section 1781 Dietrich had enjoyed
the lease but a short time after he had
become a United States Senator â that
is, after taking the oath. He said that,
although he .had received rentals from
April 24 to December 2, under the
court's construction of the section there
had been no violation of the law.' The
property was deeded to Senator Diet
rich's daughter'shortly after December,
1901.
CLEARS THE DOCKET.
"If Charles H. Dietrich was not a
member of Congress until after Decem
ber 2, 1901 â and the court held that he
was not â then Jacob Fisher cannot be
put upon trial for or on account of
agreeing to pay or paying certain sums
of money to him or performing con
tracts for him during the months from
July to October, 1901, under a contract
made with him as a member of Con
gress whereby Jacob Fisher was to be
appointed postmaster."
The court made the order and then
called up the case against Senator
Dietrich in which he is charged with
holding and enjoying a lease with the
Government while he was a United
States Senator.
Immediately after the verdict was
ordered for the defendant, District At
torney Summers announced that he
wished to enter a nolle in the case of
Jacob Fisher, postmaster at Hastings,
explaining his motion by saying:
OMAHA. Nebr.. Jan. 8.â United
States Senator Charles H. Dietrich and
Jacob Fisher, postmaster at Hastings,
Nebr, were released from custody to
day. Judge Vandeventer, in /he Circuit
Court, instructed the jury to bring in
a verdict of not guilty of the charges
of bribery, 4 etc, and the District At
torney' entered a nolle in the Indict
ments recently returned against them.
Immediately after convening court
this forenoon Judge Vandeventer hand
ed down a decision sustaining the de
murrer interposed by counsel for Sena
tor Dietrich, which had been made on
the ground that Dietrich was not act
ually a member of the Senate when
the alleged bribery took place. The ef
fect of the decision is that a rrian is
not an actual member of Congress after
his election until he shall have taken
the oath at the bar of the House to
which he is elected, and that he is not
amenable to the law as a member of
Congress and an officer of. the United
States Government.

SALEM, Or., Jan.. 8.â Through the
alertness of Guard Lute Savage, who
watches the south wall of the State
penitentiary at night, two unknown
men were baffled last night in an at
tempt to scale the stone ramparts of
the prison and place a bundle in the
yard. Savage fired at the men, but
they escaped in the darkness.
About 2 e. m. the moon â¢ /as down far
enough to cast a deep shadow along
the east wall. In making, his regular
patrol along, the top Savage discerned
two men lurbins In the shadow. He
watched them carefully and saw that
they were carrying a bundle about the
size Avhich two or three rifles would
make if wrapped up together.
Savage challenged and' instantly the
men broke out of the shadow and ran
away, carrying their bundle with them.
Before they vanished Savage flred
twice at Jhem with no visible effect.
The shots aroused the other guards and
an investigation disclosed nothing but
the tracks of two men sunk deep across
the field to the county road.
In connection with the recent attempt
to poison the night guards at the pris
on, the visit of the two men last night
is taken as proof that some of the con
victs contemplate a daring escape mod
eled along the lines of the Tracey and
Merrill disaster. The city police have
found that two strangers hired a buggy
late last night and were seen at mid
night near the penitentiary.
Special Dispatch to The Call
All questions connected with the uni
versity* exhibit at St. Louis probably
will be discussed to-day. The space
secured for the university is larger
than that given to the general display
of the school?.
SeeminglyAll the obstacles in the way
of having at the St. -Louis, exposition
a . display representative on a large
scale of the University of California
have been overcome. Commissioner
Filcher has telegraphed from St. Louis
to Professor Robert FuTlong, chief at
the department of the educational
show for California, that he has se
cured a space of 1600 square feet in
total In a very advantageous place for
what the University of California has
to show. Professor Furlong has con
sulted with certain of the committee
of the faculty of the University of
California that was appointed to take
up the matter of making a St. Louis
display and a telegram has been sent
to St. Louis notifying the management
of the exposition that the space will be
accepted.
Professor Furlong went to Berkeley
Friday afternoon to consult with the
university committee. Some of the mem
bers of the committee were absent and
a final meeting has been arranged to
take place at the university to-day.
The position that has been offered
for Ihe use of the University of Cali
fornia is in an alcove and is near ths
general educational display of this
State in the education building. The
dimensions of the floor room are 40x19
feet, with the aisles deducted.
The alcove is at a corner of the edu
cation building. It is not near ths
space, occupied by other universities,
but it has the advantage of giving
California practically a collective exhi
bition in the same building. Visitors
will see not only what sort of educa
tional facilities are afforded by the pub
lic schools and other educational in
stitutions of Jhe State in .the grammar
and high school grades and the tech
nical schools like the Lick and the Wil
merding and the Cogswell and Poly
technic High schools in this city, but
will also be given an idea of the Uni
versity of California by walking only
a Tew steos.

NEW YORK, Jan. S.â Bradstreet's
to-morrow will say: The new year
opens quietly, but with, satisfactory,
features predominating. Cold and
stormy weather has retarded business
and transportation, but in some sect
ion's has stimulated sales of heavy
goods, shoes . and rubbers at retail.
Wholesale business is seasonably quiet
at leading Eastern and Central West
ern markets, but it is worth noting
that the spring demand and shipments
have been good at the Southwest. In
dications show a slight improvement.
Preparations for spring are going for
ward actively and with a good show of
conservative confidence.
War talk has been a stimulus to
many markets, notably those for ce. ;
reals and provisions, but securities and
cotton have been depressed thereby.
â¢ Iron and steel in the cruder forms
have shown steadiness and ar& In bet
ter demand in the more finished forms
in the West.
Lumber, while affected by climatic
conditions Â° upon building, is In. active
export demand. The Industrial situa
tion looks rather better, employes
showing a disposition to accept lower
wages:
Wool is steady as a whole, based on
conservative buying: by "manufacturers
who have opened new lines of goods,
but nothing definite la yet to be seen
as to future trade tendencies. ,
The final returns of 1903 are fully as
good as those foreshadowed in earlier
weeks. December, 1903, railway earn
ings indicate a 7 per cent increase over
the excellent returns of 1902.
Wheat, including - flour, exports for
the week ending January 7, aggregate
3,369,323 bushels,, against 2,915,236 bush
els last week and 5,058,951 bushels this
week last year. ;.-â¢'.;.;Â¦'

Cashier Marcell has been removed
from his home in Highland to the coun
ty jail in Troy, where he is under heavy
guard to prevent possible injury. When
Marcell was arraigned before a Justice
of the Peace he entered a plea of not
guilty to the numerous charges of for
gery, and bail was fixed at $5000 in each
count. He said that he still had faith
in his ability to restore order if he were
permitted to exercise his own judgment.
WHOLESALE BUSINESS QUIET.
There are notes of the face value of
$57,000, one-half of which are , pro
nounced worthless. It is also stated
that a new note for 550,000 has' turned

Company of Kansas City.
ST. JOSEPH, Mo., Jan. 8.â The latest
revelations of the defalcations in the
Hank of Highland, Kansas, by Cashier
J. E. Marcell show an aggregate loss of
more than $160,000. Of this 567,000 is
on account of deposits made for the
most part by the farmers and stock
raisers of Doniphan County, Kansas.

S. C. Crammer is less than $2000, this

HAKERSFIELD. Jan. S.â Superior
Judge Mahon to-day decided the con

by the banking firm of Douglas. Lacey
& Co. of Xew York City spent last sea

of an estimated 100-ton daily capacity.
Upward of $65,000 actually was spent
on the plant, and it was not completed.
The company recently defaulted' a
$6000 payment on the mine, which un
der the terms of the option forfeits the
entire plant and prior payments of
513,000 to Standart & McGill, who have
again assumed possession. The ma

property has been attached by local
creditors for claims aggregating JSO.OOO.
It is alleged that the cause of the fail

Â¦ The Palace of Machinery, representing power,

G v^ ',, main entrance to thLs building' shows a triple
;jj[ arcade, with large pavilion In the center. The north
front, which is thirteen hundred feet in length, has an
II . Â« arcade of nine arches as a center feature.
E9 Following the classical in architectural effect, '

REGAL SHOES.
]y[any a man would like to wear
. Regals but he is ashamed to pay
so little as $3.50 for a pair of shoes.
Ashamed to take so much for so
little?
Bless you, no. He's got a sort of semi-suppressed
notion that he can't be really " swell " unless he pays from
$5 to $14 for his shoes. Now, if he would ask the sleep-
ing car porters, he*would discover that a large proportion
of those who ride in -Pullmans,, walk in Regals. And he
may be astonished to learn that a clear majority of the
officers in the American Army and Navy are now
wearing Regals.* '
The trouble is that people get the idea that because
the Regal sells at $3.50 it is a " $3.50 shoe." 'Tisn't In
everything but price it is a $6 shoeâ a fact which \we are
prepared to demonstrate by a comparison of style, fit,
finish, and . leather.qualities.

Judge James G. Maguire eulogized
the memory of Andrew Jackson before
the members of the Iroquoris Club last
evening. His address was singularly
apropos, as yesterday was the anni
versary of the battle of New Orleans,
in which Jackson took a leading part.
Judge Maguire reviewed the political
and military achievements ot Andrew
Jackson, and also recited a poem de
scriptive of the battle of New Orteans,
said to have been written by a private
soldier that took part in the conflict.
He also took up a discussion of the
controversy 'between certain ' Senatora
and President Jackson on the latter'a
interpretation of the constitution.
"Jackson's Interpretation of the-con
stitution was challenged by certain of
the Senators and he was severely criti

gardens having been received, the su
perintendent was directed to prepare
the sround for the planting.
The superintendent was also directed
to submit to the commission names to
designate the "various "avenues and
walks in Golden Gate Park.
Commissioner Lloyd submitted for
discussion an ordinance designating the
route and regulating the speed of auto
mobiles In Golden Gate Park. The or
der will come up for further considera
tion at the next meeting, of the board.
It may be then amended or passed to
print without amendment. The first
section of the proposed ordinance fol
lows:
"Section No. 1. No horseless carriage,
motor wagon or automobile or motor
bicycle shall enter or go upon any ave
nue, driveway or part of any park or
square in the city, and county of San
Francisco, except the driveway . in
Golden Gate Park commencing at the
entrance known as Waller-street en-
trance to said park, and terminating at
the exit on the great highway (which
latter is sometimes .called the Ocean
boulevard), \vhich driveway is known
as the south' drive in Golden Gate Park,
and'aiso 'oil -'and -upon -what i3 known
in 'Golden G&t& Park *asÂ» the central or
ove'rfoofir'drive " in ;said park, an* also
on and- upon the said great highway
commencing where the northerly 4lne
of Fulton street, if projected westerly,
would intersect said great highway,
thence southerly from said lln,e to the
southerly end of said great highway.
Only such vehicles as are exclusively
used for pleasure shall be permitted
upon said drives and highways."
Section 2 regulates the speed cm the
south drive, limiting the pace to ten
miles an hour. On the great highway
the speed must not exceed six miles an
hour. It is provided that mufflers shall
be used and every precaution taken to
prevent unnecessary noise. â¢ ,
- The third section provldesf that. any
person violating. the provisions of the
ordinance shall be deemed guilty of a
misdemeanor and shall be punishable
by imprisonment not exceeding six
months or by a fine not exceeding $500
nor less than $50.
The proposition to allow automobiles
to travel on what is known ag the
overlook drive caused debate. Mr.
Lloyd said the privilege was especially
desired In order that strangers visiting
the park In automobiles - might get a
fair view of the surroundings, .'f,, ; ;,
* It was the sense of the commission
that the automobile had come to stay,
and that those using* carriages of this
fashion should enjoy such facilities as
could be safelv extended, but. that tha
important fact should always be- con
sidered that the park was created for
the people and not for a wealthy class.

the peddlers' wagon was in front of
the house. Robert Lindenstadt came
down the steps leading to the base
ment with a dozen oranges in his
hand. Curry told him to go away,
as he did not want any oranges, and
Lindenstadt, Curry claims, replied
that a woman inside had ordered
them. They had some words and. It

get his big brother and '.'do Curry up."
The Lindenstadts returned, each
carrying several stones, and, It .is

Among .business and professional
men, among those Who stand for all
that is stable in public and private life, 1
the death of John A. Muir is regarded
as a loss which will be hard to offset.
For fifteen years he had been a leader
in public affairs of Los Angeles.
Muir entered the employ Â»of the Cen
tral Pacific in 1869 as telegraph op
erator at Rocklin and was successive
ly trainmaster, assistant superintend
ent of the Sacramento division, super
intendent at Yuma and for more than
ten years superintendent here. He had
expected to be made fourth vice presi
dent, but another wa%appointed. When |
H. E. Huntington wanted him he went j
with him and for three years devoted r
his energies to the extension of the !
Huntington electric lines. He was a
Mason and a member of the various
commercial organizations. The funeral'
will be held Sunday and will b2 attend
ed by representatives of nearly all the
public bodies of Los Angeles.
Death of Mrs. George C. liolrit.
He was asked to name these persons
and at his dictation a list was made
out. During the late hours of the night
those persons came to his bedside and
to each he bade farewell. He said he
was not afraid to die,' but that he had
hoped to be with his friends for years
to come. Then he became unconscious,
having first bade members of his fam
ily good-by.
"I know that I am dying," he said,
feebly, "but there are persons dear to
me whom I want to see."
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 8.â John Allan
Muir, general manager of the Los An

an^illness of many weeks. The end came
painlessly.. Surrounded by his family,
he passed away after a period of un
consciousness which had continued al
most throughout last night. Yesterday
evening, when the sick man was
aroused from the lethargy which pre
ceded death, he stated that he realized
his condition. : Â¦

cc.ppc-r ores, and mining development
!s under way on a small scale at a
! number of different points outside of
! Salt Lake and Beaver counties."
"Arizona 5s the scene of the most
pronounced activity in copper mining
developments to be noted in any part
of the United States. This Territory
has four largely developed fields, these
being, in order of present importance,
the Bisbee field of Cochise County, the
Clifton-Mcrencl field of Graham Coun
ty and the Jerome field of Yavapai
County. Â¦ ' Â¦ . '. - . .
"Nearly every county in Utah has

ducer of any copper field of the United
States or of the world. Litigation' ham
pers deVelopment, with no prospect of
an early settlement. The Anaconda is
no longer the richest mine of the dis
trict, arid the Boston and Montana Is
a worthy successor. The principal new
development under way is the mine and
smelter of the Pittsburg and Montana,
the latter planned on a new system,
soon to be given trial. Various copper
fields outside of the Butte district re
port renewed activity.
"Michigan hag made a notable in-,
crease in production, of upward of 28,
000.000 pounds in a single yearâ much
the greatest ever secured. The old
mines show little or no increase, with
the exception of the Wolverine, the
added copper coming mainly from the
j Baltic, Trimountain, Champion and
'. Mohawk mines.
"Previous to 1S50 the total production
of the United States was but a few
thousand tons, from the period of the
first attempt at copper mining in New
Jersey in 1719. During the year 1903
American mines turned out but 4000
tons less of refined copper than was
made by the entire United States up
to and including the year 18S0, and
made almost exactly ten t:.nes as much
copper as was made in the^ear 1881.
In every working day of the year
American mines now make as much
copper as all the mines of the country
made in 1831, and make as much copper
every week as was made in the year
1S59. when the Lake Superior mines
were already famous as the most pro
ductive and profitable copper mines of
the known world.
GREAT OPERATIONS.
Horace J. Stevens furnishes an an
nual review of the copper trade to the
Mining World in which is much of in
terest to the copper producers in Cali
fornia. Stevens writes that beginning
with the year 1S50 It will be found that
the production of American copper has
increased nearly 500 per cent.
"The American production has
doubled since so recent a year as 1894.
Beginning with 1S49. the year in which
the first American copper mine paid a
dividend, the production has doubled
in the periods ending with the years
1S52, 1S53, 1S36, 1S62. 1873, 1SS1. 1SS4. 1891,
1899. and has gained more than 25"per
cent in volume in the four years since
1S59.
THE COPPER OUTPUT..
A Deadwood correspondent of the
Redding Searchlight writes that the
two largest properties in the greatest
quartz mining camp in Trinity County
have been closed, these being the
Brown Bear and the L,appin. Of the
latter the Searchlight says: "The min
ers employed by the Lappin Gild Min
ing Company, which operated the Lap
pin mine * several months under
bond, have*" got their money out of the
ore milled at the Brown Bear mill and
have left the camp. The financial ob
ligations of the company are not yet
fully paid, and several lawsuits will
no doubt result. The property is now
closed down. Ex-Mayor Davie of Oak
land and another gentleman were here
last week inspecting the Lappin. They
expressed themselves as quite favor
ably impressed with the mine, and
stated that they would endeavor to
secure an option to purchase it from
the owners, Jesse Tourtellotte, M. A.
Brady and Robert Cochran, who -re
side in Weaverville."
The Mining and Scientific Press re
ports that a company has been organ
ized to work a group of claims in Nye
County. Nevada, at Timber Hill. The
Tybo Mining Company, at Tybo, is re-,
ported to have suspended operations
and that attachments and liens have
been levied on the company's property.
It is generally expected that the com
pany will soon resume work.

MAPPING THE COUNTIES.
"If San Francisco realized the situa
tion in Alaska as it now is, not as it
was when the froth and scum of the
1000 rush floated back to her, broken
and discouraged. I am sure she would
not allow herself to be surpassed by a
younger and more active rival just be
cause it is a few hundred miles nearer
to the scene of '..operations. â¢ There are
smart . men, experienced men, success
ful miners of California that go to
Nome every year. They are a mere
drop in the bucket compared with the
number that this great field stands
ready to enrich. A liow of trade and
gold can be started from Alaska now
that will do more than" all else to con
tinue unimpaired the present metropol
itan prestige of this city.
"There are scores of 'Alaskans here
spending the winter. They are the
prosperous ones, the operators, - thu
ones controlling* enterprises and' the
large buyers of machinery and supplies.'
Their purchases will', amount ;to/mill
ions of dollarsÂ»a year, and more of this
class can be attracted to this city with
a little effort. As a first step there
should be organized by merchants an
Alaskan club in this city, as in Seattle,
to start the gold stream this way in
part at least."
President Watkins of the San Fran
cisco .Board of Trade and President
Andrea Sbarboro of the Manufactur
ers' and Producers'. Association of Cali
fornia said last evening that th*ey had
heard of the Alaska Club. They did
not believe that throwing open any ex
isting club or the establishment of an
Alaskan Club in San Francisco would"
influence business in any way. Presi
dent Watkins said that Alaska would
buy in San Francisco what it could se
cure here at better advantage than It
could elsewhere, but probably nothing
else. ' Â¦ - ' '
"Seattle business men have organ
ized an Alaska Club and maintain
headquarters or clubhouse, for Alas
kans, to secure reliable information of
Alaskan opportunities and to foster
alliances that make for Alaskan trade.
Northwestern Alaska alone, young and
undeveloped, has so far produced near
ly $23,000,000 and now developments
are in progress, the digging of ditches
and developing of water powers that ln
a year or two will make Seward penin
sula the greatest hydraulic mining re
gion in the worldâ a.. region that, will
produce more gold every year than ever
came out of the Klondike in its banner
seas*on.
THE SEATTLE METHOD.
There are in the city prominent min
ing men from Alaska who are doing
business on the Seward peninsula, the
Nome district and vicinity. A state
ment was made by one of these' men
last evening concerning the means that
the Seattle people employ to" interest
the Alaskan miners and to gain their
trade. His statement is as follows: Â¦
San Francisco to Alaskan ports. A
large proportion of the goods that are
shipped from Seattle to Alaska are
undoubtedly manufactured in the East,
but thev figure as exports from the
Sound ports. Mr. Hill Is building up the
north as much as he can and that is a
factor in this consideration of statiB
tics concerning exports."
No explanation was supplied by any
merchant of tho-falling off in the ex
ports of San Francisco to the Philip
pines during the fiscal year, ending June
30, 1903, such decrease amounting to
$IM7,S97. None can well "be afforded un
til the figures are analyzed and the ar
ticles and amounts of each exported
have been ascertained. . Â¦

NAMES HIS COMMITTEES
"Geographical position has much to
do with it," said Mr. Watkins. "There
is no sentiment in the matter of placing
the Alaskan trade. It takes less time
to lay goods down in Alaska from the
Middle- West by way of Seattle than it
does by way of San : Francisco. The
rail rates to the Sound ports from the
manufacturing" cities of the East are as
low and possibly lower than they are
to San Francisco. On some articles the
rates to Seattle are lower than they
are to^San 'Francisco. -The distance
from Seattle to Alaska. Is. several hun
dred miles less than the distance from
Several explanations were given of
the advance that the Sound ports are
making in securing the Seattle trade,
The clearest of these statements was
made by A. A. Watkins, president of
the San Francisco Board of Trade. . .
A. A. WATK1XS' VIEWS.
The general explanation received
from" many merchants who were vis
ited yesterday - was. that. -the showing
must mainly be attributed to the en
terprise of "Jim" Hill, who is building
up the Sound ports as much* as possi
ble, and to lower rates " for moving
freight than are to be secured to San
Francisco from the transqontlnenta!
lines doing business here. Hill has
been doing a great business in moving
lumber to the Eastern States over his
lines. This gives him empty cars to
load up in the East for the return trip,
and this i3 the basis of the lower
westbound rates that he is reported tc
be making.
By the summary it was shown to be
a fact that the export trade of the
ports on Puget Sound to the Philip
pines in the fiscal year ending June 30,
1903, amounted to $1,128,999, as against
the sum of $306,876 for the preceding
twelve months, a gain of more than
$820,000, or more than $68,000 gain per
month.
San Francisco's exports to the Philip
pines in the fiscal year ending June 30,
1903, were $479,640, as compared with
$827,537 for the year preceding, a loss of
$347,888. Â¦
Â¦ The Alaska business was-seen to also
be largely to the advantage of the ports
on Puget Sound. The Sound ports in
the 'fiscal year ending June 30, 1903,
were shown to have sent to' Alaska
goods to the value of $6,13S,089, as
against a total value of $2,955,341, the
difference in favor of the ports on the
Sound amounting to 53,182,758, or a gain
of $227,000 more than- the entire ship-'
ments from San Francisco to Alaska
in the period under discussion.
The publication in The Call exclu
sively of the official figures Just issued
by the United States Government rela
tive to the export trade of the main
land of the United States to its non^
continguous country, the Philippines
and Alaska in particular, created much
talk and not a little wonderment ln
the mercantile community of . San
Francisco. The figures in question
were compiled by the customs officials
of the United States under the pro
visions of a law of AprH 29, 1902.
They were representative of the
business done in the fiscal year end
ing June 30, 1902, and 1903. They
bore the official sanction of the Gov
ernment and were the first definite as
certainments made officially by the
Government concerning the movement
of . exports to, Alaska and the Philip
pines and also to other islandic posses
sions of the United States.

moonshine whisky and vote the Repub

continually Ho keep the Internal reve

He has a weak, squeaky little voice

Gibson was addressing himself to

exclaimed:

The method of raising money that the Independent
proposes is an annual State tax of one:half mill for agri
cultural purposes, the proceeds to be distribute^,* under
proper safeguards, among the cities of San Francisco,
Los Angeles, Sacramento, Stockton, San , Jose and Fres
no, "for the purpose of maintaining permanent agricul
tural exhibits to which^all counties shall have constant
access for a reasonable display of products under cer
tain conditions." This sort; of show at central points,
the Independent says,. would "help the whole State."
The oVooosition is too novel' to be iudged- witKout full
THE Stockton Independent has started on a crusade
to have permanent exhibitions of the products of
California maintained in several localities in the
State, these to take the place of agricultural fairs. The
purpose of the Independent would seem to be .to have
laws enacted by* the Legislature at its next session to
provide for the most effective form of exploitation of
the State's resources that can be devised. Whether its
plan is effective or not may become a matter of discus
sion, but the views enunciated, proceeding from the city
at the tidewater of the San Joaquin Valley, and in a
community intensely * devoted to advancement on all
lines, merit the attention of all. Â¦Â¦ '
' It'is advocated- by the Independent that "the commer
cial'organizations and promotion .agencies of the State,
i which rely almost entirely on the products of agricul
ture as' the basis their campaign to secure immi
grants and investments, shall make a determined move
at the next meeting of the State Legislature to get laws
that will- place this particularly modern type of public
duty on a sound and legal basis." j
Coming to particulars, after a general attack upon the
agricultural fairs, the Independent says: . ,
"What should be done is to evolve a plan by which
the' State money appropriated to promote agricultural
competition and exploitation* may be expended along
modern lines, b} r agencies equipped for the. purpose, and
that will- maintain permanent and standing exhibits at
the points in the State most frequented. That' means
that the $50,000 or $100,006 which the State : usually ex
pends annually should be put in service to fortify the
promotion work of organized societies that display the
most enterprise at .the several chief points of distribu
tion.in the State." ' V ; V >. '

There are several claims that Nevada County makes
through the Miner. "It may seem paradoxical, but it is
no He to" say that Nevada Coun|y has as many kinds of
climate as can be found in any one State of America. It
has every variety of . scenery from the most rugged
mountains and precipitous canyons to the peaceful pas
toral pictures of valleys where eternal summer reigns.
It is the banner gold "mining county of California. Its
dairy products are first winners at the State fair. Its
fruits are among the best flavored and most luscious
grown in any county. It is the best watered county on
the Pacific Coast. Its' people are the most hospitable,
progressive and happy to be found anywhere."
This would seem to be sufficient to attract the atten
tion Nevada County people think is due' to their home
precincts, but the Miner adds to the picture the. following
touches:
"Just at present the natural ice crop is being har
vested at and around' Truckee in the eastern part of the
county. At Pet Hill, in the southwestern portion,
oranges are being gathered. At the town of Maybcrt,
which lies snugly down in the deep canyon of the South
Yuba. River, the mighty mountain on the south has shut
out every glimpse of sunshine for more than two months
past, and old Sol will.not be able to cast his Â¦''effulgent
beams into the depths until about the 2d of February."
n-^HE traveler who will take the Central Pacific line
I to Colfax and then ride on the connecting train that

find himself in an extremely pleasing and picturesque
region, stimulating to imagination and satisfactory in
actual contemplation. It, however, remains for a ,home
observer, one acquainted with its almost infinite, variety,
to adequately speak for Nevada County. Such a person
is found in the editor of the Nevada County Miner, who
writes that "at some time of the year, when the denizens
of the upper levels are reveling in the joys of snow
shoeing, coasting or skating, their neighbors of the
lower foothills are picking flowers and strawberries and
the like in their house yards."
Seeing the picturesqueness of the situation the editor
again writes: "It is in this same wonderful county where
the people gather the most luscious fruits from the sur
face of their lands and, tunneling under their orchards
and vineyards, dig QUt tht gold bearing rock and
gravel.') , *

Party lines are 'drawn In Hawaii
much more sharply than in any .other
part of the United States. Far more, in
fact, than In the South is the political
line there the color line, and as in most
other places the color line is drawn
more, jealously and more sharply, by
the dark race than by the whites.
White men, Indeed, have small reason
for drawing lines. They are placed by
the fact of bfrth In the superior posi
tion. It is the men below the Inie who
must assert themselves without an as
sertion of inferiority. .
The Republican party in Hawaii is
the -party, of the administration natur
a?iy. It was to the Republican party on
the mainland that the first appeal of
the annexationists wa^ addressed,' and
th-Â» annexatlonlsts are not ungrateful.
The annexatlonists, likewise, represent
the whole sentiment hostile to the na
tive monarchical Idea. It Is natural,
tr.ereiore, that all the elements hostile
to this sentiment should drift together
:md become wedded Into one politlc.il
Tliat election, however, was only an
accident to a strangely mixed political
condition. There are but two political
I>r.rties in Hawaii, the Republican and"
the Home Rule. The last name is most
significant. Home, .rule, in Hawaii,
stands for native rule, and a condition
as nearly answering to actual political
independence as is posfble under the
Government of the United States. More
than that, it stands for the burning and,
over-present desire of the natives of*
the islands to be really Independent,
v.lth their own native ruler on . the '
throne and no closer relations with this
country than obtained In the good old
days of the lamented and seldom sober
Kalakaua. . Â¦
This sentiment in not a matter of I
personal loyalty to Lilluokalani, nor to
any particular prince or princess of
her. line. The Hawaiian wants a king
or a queen, and it chances that at the
present moment l,iliuokalani represents
thfs racial want. That is the secret
of her strength with her people, just
as it would be of the strength of the
present Hawaiian delegate in Congress,
Prince Kuhio, commonly known as
"Prince Cupid," if. Lilluokalani were
out of, the wa>> and i ht" should'" chance
to be the next pretender In line. In
fact Prince Kuhio is in Congress now,
not bo much because of his personal
popularityâ although he is personally
very popular at the islands â as because
he represent?, in some measure, this
loyalty "of the Hawaiians to the Idea
of monarchy. Prince Kuhio was elected
as a Republican, it is true, and in op
position to' the candidate of the ex-
Queen, who was conceded to represent
the native desire for Independence;
nevertheless he would not have been
elected if the natives who voted for him
had not believed that the Prince,
though not of the blood royal, must
still stand in some sort for the monÂ«*
archical idea.
This is, nevertheless, the fact. We
are holding Hawaii, so far as the na
tives are concerned, as a conquered
country. We are holding it by moral
force, it is true, for the army of oc
rupation is small. Camp McKinley,
near Honolulu, the only military post
on the islands, could not long survive
an attack by the natives in force. But
the Hawaiians know that the shores of
the American mainland are not far
away, and that with the vessels at
the command of the United States it
would be a matter of a few days only
before a force large enough to exterm
inate them could be landed.
It is the moral force of this knowl
edge that holds the Hawaiians Â©"rom
open rebellion against the United
States, not any love for this country
or its people or its institutions. As a
matter of fact the native Hawaiian has
no love for us whatever. He loves his
own beautiful Island, and he dreams
of the day when a kindly fate will re
store to â¢ the throne some one of the
line of duaky Sovereigns whom he wor
ships.
It" has "become so. much a matter of
course in the short time since the an
nexation of Hawaii to look upon the
islands and their inhabitants as belong
ing to the United States that it will
surprise many readers to learn that
the native Hawaiians have never been
entirely reconciled to the absorption of
th^ir country."

These ligures and comparisons give
some idea of the stupendous interests
Involve**, in the decision to be rendered
bjf the Supreme Court in the Northern
Heturities case, for ( if that decision is
favorable lo that company the
monopoly feature of the railroads will
be emphasized, inasmuch as the con
trol of these vasts interests might be
<onccntrai.ed in one great securities
holding company. It might be a
benevolent monopoly, and its opera
tion actually benefit the commerce of
the country, but it would constitute a
power In r.ome respects bigger
than the Government itself. In
the Northern Securities case the
fact that the combination has the
power to restrain trade is held
to makn ii a combination in restraint
of trade, although its attorneys claim
that it is a combination designed ac
tually to benefit and expand trade.
Before 1803 the railroad* as a rule
xv ere j-heaply built. They were oper
ated, for the most part, on a hand-to
mouth basis, floating debts had to be
created in order to obtain, the neces
sary working capital, there was gen
eral demoralization in rates and dis
astrous traffic wars.' Much of the dis
tress caused by the panic of 1893 was
due to the weakness of the railroad
ronipanies, many of which went into
bankruptcy.
In the past ten years there has been
a wonderful transformation. The
jihysical iciidition of the railroads,
their bridges, roadbeds, fails, rolling
stock and the like have been \ largely
renewed in a most substantial meas
ure, *=o that construction has become
of u. more permanent character, par
taking largely of the solidity, of the
English railways. Moreover much of
this his been accomplished out of
earning!!, have been notable
ecorrtonies in operation." The system
of getting- the most and thÂ« best out
of the railroads at the least cost, with
out impairing 'heir efOcleney and pub
'!c service, has been carried almost to
the point of an exact science. Presi
dent James J. Hill of the Great North
ern Railroad, who has beeniargeiy In
strumental in reducing: the cost of
operation to the lowest possible point,
Â«nd at thÂ«Â» same time of raising the
efficiency, now says that the limit of
economy has been reached and that
rates must be advanced unless prices
of supplies a *'d wages of labor are re
duced.
The railroads have outstanding 512,
513,5$1,425 of stocks and bonds, repre
senting one-eighth of the estimated
wealth of the United States. The capi
talization in stooka and bonds is equal
to the total government debts of France,
'Jreat IJritain, Italy and the United
States. Last year they carried 635,000.
000 j>aspengersÂ». a number greater than
all the Mongolians in the world and
nearly one-half as great as the earth's
entire population.
The tons of freight moved were 1,192,
126,510, or more than five times the
weight of all the coal, iron, steel, cot
ton, wool and copper produced In the
United States. The gross earnings from
traffic were in 1902 $1,720,814,900. and the
operating expenses $1,160,788,623. The
receipts were 251 per cent greater than
the receipts of the United States Gov
ernment, and it cost twice as much to
operate the railroads as it does to run

â¢Railway transportation," said Inter
state Commerce Commissioner Prouty to
the American Economic Association six
month? ago, "is a monopoly."
If this Is a fact it is important to
know how big a monopoly it is. Not
much investigation is needed to dis
cover that there is none other equal
t.Â» it.
In the first place It Is continental in
Â«cojie and power. The railroad touches
American Hie. American business and
American civilization at every point.
There ar<> in the United States 204,000
mites of railway â thi? being more than
in any other country. These 201,000
miles are nwned by about 2000 compa
nies, of which 1015 are operating com
panies and in which there are more
than l.ofKMHW stockholders. ThesÂ»e com
panies are combined in nineteen differ
ent systems, controlled practically by
a group of nine men. The railroads in
1902;" paid $178,200.7^2 in dividends and
(04,712,000 in wages. They afforded live
lihood to 3.000.000 persons, employes and
their families. It lsÂ« not too much to
pay that one in every Eeven persons
in th<- country has a more or less di
rect concern in the railroads.
If then this is a monopoly, it is a
monopoly on when millions depend for
their bread and butter. Moreover, it Is
a monopoly tempered by certain eco
nomic conditions that have the force
of competition, that is regulated by a
certain degree of governmental super
vision and that is subject in no small
measure to the restraining influence of
market movements. *

ON January '4 there occurred two events which
have a strong significance in the still unsettled
problem of what kind of government is to be
eventually bestowed upon our possessions in the Pacific
and the Caribbean. Chief Justice Fuller a>f the Federal
Supreme Court on that day passed downla decision to
the effect that Porto Ricaos are not aliens, but are en
titled' to free access to this country. Upon the same
day, away off on the other side of the globe, there was
put into effect the Hawaiian county government act,
providing the Hawaiian?, for the first time in their his
tory, with a machinery for. local government outside of
municipalities.
With the institution of the county government system
Hawaii is now as full-fledged a Territory as Oklahoma
and higher in the scale than Alaska. With the decision
by Chief Justice Fuller that Porto Ricans are exempt from
the provisions of the immigration law we are confronted
by about 953,000 new citizens, for if not aliens what else
are these residents in the territory of the United States?
Here, then, are two peoples, citizens of the United
States; not States; notcolonies; not protectorates.
In a recent speech the Hon. Whitelaw Reid vigor
ously condemned the idea of ever admitting to statehood
any of the islands of the sea which are now ours or
which may become ours. This is right in line with the
expansionist policy which Mr. Reid has supported from
the time he sat with>the Peace Commissioners at Paris.
It is no retrograde movement from the policy of the
party which carried through a successful war with Spain
and has successfully provided provisional governments
for the lands wrested from that power.. Yet at the re
cent McClellan love feast in New York, when some Bour
bon voiced a rumor that President Roosevelt had in mind
the formation of a colonial Cabinet and that leading Re
publicans in Congress favored the idea, the dining-hall
shook with Democratic denunciation.
We have entered upon a colonial policy once and for
all. A change in politics could not effect a reversal to
the old order of things. Should the Democrats get into
power, what could they do to change the colonial policy?
Either they would have to hold out a promise of state
hood .to opr island dependencies or imitate Cleveland in
his policy of dealing with Hawaii. The futility of Cleve
land's effort to restore the Hawaiian monarchy is, how
ever, too fresh in. the public* mind for even the most
blundering ,of Democrats to venture upon a similar pol
icy. . Wenjay therefore conclude that the, policy adopted
by McKihley and followed by Roosevelt in dealing with
the islands will continue, no matter what administration
comes into power. *
OUR COLONIAL POLICY.
Four of our torpedo-boats demonstrated on "an At
lantic run the other day that they cannot stand the test
of ordinary weather, and for the purposes for wfiich they
have been constructed would be useless. Incidents of
incapacity in our fighting cr^aft^are becoming so frequent
that it is about time for the nation to insist upon a peace
party and intrench it absolutely in power in Washington.
In view of Mr. Pinchot's report, it seems as* if the
State has official duty and responsibility in the matter of
saving our forests. Lumbermen themselves are im
pressed with the desirability of making the timber crop
permanent by careful harvesting. It is probable that
legislative concert with them would product results in
the way of a State Forestry Commission, with such juris
diction and resources as will enable it to co-operate with
timber land owners^ in the 1 prevention of forest' fires.
Fire Is the first enemy of the timber to be fought. If
only the saw and ax were used the forests would go on
repeating themselves. Eut when the blazing besom of a
timber fire has swept the mountains they are left bare
and blear.
Last year millions of fine pines from twenty to fifty
feet high were burned and destroyed. From the rail
road this destruction may be seen on both sides of the
track from Auburn to Colfax. Between the North and
Middle, forks of the American River, square miles of
such trees were burned during the summer. The pres
ent and prospective value 1 of the timber destroyed would
pay for a forest patrol on every township of timber for
the next hundred years. No doubt if such commission is
proposed in the next Legislature, men will run and look
into the treasury and say it will not stand the,'expe,'nst.
Let them instead run and look into the future; let them
see the mountains stripped of their timber by fire and
then of their soil by erosion: let them see. the water lost
in torrential channels and the valleys turned again into
deserts; let them see the baked earth, where the grapes
of Eschol and the fruit of the gods r once grew, and then
say whether the expense of preventing all this is too
great for the treasury. . â¢
Just what such a future would be is now on view in
Montenegro and in Palestine; The soil of Montenegro
is washed off and the terraced rocks remain; barren sand
glistens where the daughters of Shiloh danced in the
vineyards. If California is wise we will not destroy our
mountain forests, no matter what it costs to preserve
them.
California gets more space and consideration in that
report than any other State. The nobility and grandeur
and economic value of our forests justify this attention
to their welfare. Nowhere else on earth are such trees
found as beard the cheeks- of our mountains. In the
moving pictures which are to illustrate the resources and
industries of the State at St. Louis is one, in the lumber
group, which shows the felling of a giant sugar pine on
the 'slopes of Mount Shasta. The ax men appear and cut
the- saw clef, and the sawyers put in the great crosscut
saw, and finally the autocthon falls.
The scene is thrilling enough even without the dying
groan that goes up in the final moment. Immediately
upon the falling of the tree a man jumps a big black
horse on the stump and gallops him around it. In no
other way can strangers be as fully impressed with the
size of our timber. They read the measurement in girth
and cross section, but the figures make but little impres
sion. When they see a tree felled and a horse ridden on
the stump, they are not looking at figures, but facts.
These moving pictures in the group of lumber indus
tries will not only impress the country with the great
ness of our forests, but with the rapidity of their de
struction. When they are gone the beauty of the moun
tains and the fertility of the valleys will be destroyed.
Well may the valley rancher exclaim,. "I look to the
mountains whence cometh my help."
THE Call has ssid that the forests of the continent
are making their last stand on the Pacific. , Like
the Indians who cared for them, and for whom
they were a home, the forests have fallen before advanc
ing civilization, and have yielded to the a* and saw and
fire, from the Atlantic Coast clear to the Sierra Nevada,

to $2890, a striking evidence of the
benefits of' progressive management,
with high-^class labor and freedom
from speculative tendencies. ; Un
doubtedly the strength of the railroads
is one of the most reassuring features
of the business situation at this time,
when there is so much talk of a re
action in trade. The development of
the railroads has called for a vast sum
of money that has in large degree
caused the congestion of credits in the
money market, but the .railroads â to
their honor, let it be saidâ have been
remarkably free from the speculative
excesses of the past few years.
Most of the advance which the rail
roads have made in the last ten years
has been achieved since 1897, when
the trans-Mississippi decision was ren
dered. That decision, it may (be re
called, made railroad pooling illegal.
It was thought at the .time that the
decision struck a blow at railroad de
velopment, from which recovery
would be difficult.. But as a matter
of fact, while the decision changed the
direction of railroad development. It
did not prevent it.
"Excuse me one minute, madam,"
said Dr. McElroy, and he stepped into
his office and , called up the Central
Emergency ambulance.
She was dressed in blue serge and
wore, a skirt that would have covered
a fifty- vara lot. Her umbrella was of
a delicate pea green tinge from long
usage. The bonnet she wore in a rak
ish manner on the back of her grizzled
Psyche knot was of the Civil War
period. Altogether she was a relic.
When she had made her presence
known to Dr. McElroy she stated that
she wished to be taken Into the City
and County Hospital because she had
nervous troubles of a rare sort. She
said that her complaint was so bad
that no- lodging-house keeper would
allow her to stay longer than a week
â they didn't like her sweet little pets.
The urbane doctor was about to ac
commodate her when she expressed
the greatest solicitude for a battered
old valise which she carried in her
hand. "My little pets are in here,"
quoth she, "and I would not be sep
arated from them for a minute. If I
did I would never have anotner day
of good luck, and Lord, knows I have
had enough bad luck."
'.'May I be permitted to see your
pets?" asked the doctor.
"Yes, but you must not make face3
at the little dears and scare them.
The ashman made faces at them once
and one of them died within a week.
I had the ashman arrested and he is
now in San Quentln for murder in the
second degree." With this Introduc
tion the old woman carefully opened
the satchel and after unwrapping a
bundle of tissue paper and old rags
she brought to view a tin can, per
forated with holes. Tenderly she
opened the can and there within dis
played to the doctor a squirming mass
of six young rats.
"Their father was a kangaroo,"
said the battered old woman, "and
they never knew who their mother
was. â¢ I know, however, but I will
never tell them the history of their
birth â the shame would kill them."
She leaned toward the doctor's ear
and whispered in an awesome voice:

The annual meeting of the Asso

rf-oom of the Palace Hotel yesterday
afternoon and was marked by an ex
ceptionally large attendance. Osgood
Putnam, president of the organization,
presided..
The proceedings were opened by an
address by Oscar Gushing of the State
Board of Charities, who spoke of the
work among the unfortunate by the
members of that organization and,
dwelt at length on the necessity of
educating public opinion on the mat
ters of. charity. He declared that no
matter how hard representatives of
charitable institutions labored their
work would never be as effective as 1
desired until the public had lent its
sympathy to their projects.
Miss Lucy R. Fisher reviewed in an
interesting manner the good work ac
complished by herself and associates
in the hospitals, and Miss - Katherine
Felton, secretary of the Associated
Charities, told a pretty story of how
the sopiety is endeavoring to care for
helpless children, whose unfortunate
condition comes under its attention.
Charles A. Murdock, vice president
of the society, followed with an ad
dress, during which he referred to the
necessity of the city establishing a de
tention home for children whp are
brought before the newly created
Juvenile Court, At. present, he said,
there is no place for these unfortu
nates except ln-the cells of the prisons,
where a demoralizing Influence always
prevails. He also called the attention
of the society to the present deplorable
condition of the City and County Hos
pital and expressed the hope that it
would not be removed to the proposed
site near the Almshouse.
He advocated- a more liberal ..ex
penditure of money, by the city for
the maintenance of the hospital and
in this connection he stated that the
average cost per capita for maintain
ing inmates of seven different hospitals
in the East was $1 90, as against 64
cents in the local ,. County Hospital.
Of the latter amount, the speaker said,
24. cents was for food and 40 : cents
for the care of patients. ' In the East

At 8:45 yesterday morning Temple
was seen approaching the intersection
of Townsend and Seventh streets as
a northbound Southern Pacific train
was approaching. Temple stopped four
or five feet from the rail and waited
until the pilot was within a few feet
of him. Then he threw himself across
the track and in a rew seconds^ was
mangled almost beyond recognition.' .

his station on the left-hand side of tlie t
cab saw the unfortunate .man:!, thx'iw
himself under the wheels and at pnee
notified Engineer M. E.- Montgomery,
who brought the train to a sudden halt.
Temple's body was fearfully mutil
ated. The head, arms and legs had
been severed from the trunK and the
trunk itself was twisted and broken by
the iron wheels.

Temple yesterday morning threw him
self in front of a Southern Pacific train
and was killed Instantly.
Temple was a bright man with many
excÂ«llent qualities and the cardinal
fault of intemperance. He > had been
engaged in canvassing for the P. F.
pollier publications for several months,
and v when he attended to business his
commissions amounted to a very de
sirable salary. Two weeks ago he
starred on a spree and kept .drinking
day and night. When delirious with
liquor last Tuesday afternoon Temple
entered the Starr King building, and
finding that Miss May Cardoza looked
good to him threw his arms around her
neck and. -tried to kiss her. Her
screams summoned Miss Marjorie Mc-
Lennan, a stenographer, and she be
ing fair also Temple tried to hug her,
but she fought him off, and Temple was
taken to jail. He was released on 5700
bail on Thursday. On the evening of
that day E. J. Champion, for whom
Temple was working, received a card

"The Board of Harbor Commissioners
may have had evidence brought to its
attention outside of hearings of the
beard," said Mr. Davis.
"After the manner of the Dreyfus
case," retorted Mr. McEnerney. "Was
any resolution other than those in evi
dence adopted? Was any other testi
mony taken?"
Foy was recalled to the witness stand
and testified that between November
15 and December 3 there were no meet
ings of the board. â¢
W. H. Davis asked the witness if he
had heard of the board meeting as a
committee of the whole, and the wit
ness answered affirmatively.
"The Commissioners cannot meet ex
cept as a board to deprive people of
their rights," said Mr. McEnerney.
Foy testified that he was present
when the hearing of December 3 took
place. This testimony was introduced
to establish the fact of a hearing which
had not been made clear In testimony.
Foy said that' witnesses were called and
examined. :> .*;
Nothing else essential to getting at
the facts was given in testimony. Coun
sel expressed the opinion that the
r>earing of arguments would consume
half a day or more. Judge Sloss as
signed January 20 for the summing up
of the case.
Mr. McEnerney asked of Secretary
Foy whether the Harbor Commissioners
promulgated any rule prior to Decem
ber 4, 1903, to regulate the sale of per
ishable products on the State's
wharves. Secretary Foy thought none
was issued.
Commissioner Spear said that none
was promulgated earlier than Decem
ber 4. 1903.
Secretary Foy having been excused
from the witness stand, Mr. McEnerney
said that he wanted to have it admitted
that no proceedings had been taken
by the Harbor Commissioners relative
to the matter at issue except what was
included in the records that had been
put In as evidence.
"We are not prepared to make that
admission," said Attorney W. H. Davis.
"What will you admit?" asked Mr.
McEnerney.
Judge Sloss made no ruling, but said
he would rule when the case was all in.
ASKS ABOUT RULES.
Mr. McEnerney interposed that it was
difficult to argue the merits of the ob
jection advanced to the Introduction of
testimony that fills twenty to thirty
pages of typewritten copy unless the
copy was read. The Attorney General,
he also said, had argued the whole
case. The case depended upon the evi
dence in the records.
"It is alleged in the complaint," said
Attorney General Webb, "that no no
tice was given, but it will not be con
tended that It was insufficient, inas
much as the plaintiff and his attor
ney appeared. The law provides for a
specially constituted tribunal in this
matter, which is the Board of State
Harbor Commissioners. The act does
not provide for an appeal and the de
termination of the Board of Commis
sioners is final and conclusive.
"When the Harbor Commissioners
acted they had jurisdiction. The
court, at least in this proceeding, can
not inquire into any act of the board
under this law. The law does not pro
vide for a review or a rehearing. The
board has jurisdiction to determine
wrongly as well as correctly. If the
Harbor Commissioners erred it does
not lie in the power of the board to
review their action. The court could
not have interfered if the board had
decided not to revoke the permits to
sell perishable products on the State
property. The court cannot inquire
into the acts of a specially constituted
board unless there is something in the
law that gives the authority. In this
act no such authority is conferred."^
ReinsteUi also read the reply that
was made by Wolf of Wolf & Sons to
the board. ,
Attorney General Webb said that he
would object to the admission of the
transcript of the proceedings that took
place on December 3 last. He also
said that on December 3 the secretary
of Wetmore Bros., the plaintiffs in this
case, was present and Attorney Rein
stein was also present as attorney for
the plaintiff.
"Technically," said Mr. Reinstein,
"I was not present."
Attorney General Webb then 'said
that it was a fact that the secretary of
Wetmore Bros, and also Attorney
Reinstein were present when the hear
ing of December 3 took place and they
came to the meeting-room of the
board by reason of the notice that had
been sent out b^ Secretary Foy of the
Harbor Commission.
WEBB MAKES POINTS.
BOOKS ARE PRODUCED.
Attorney General Webb said that
he had no statement to make at that
time.
Mr. McEnerney called Secretary Foy
of the Harbor Commission to pro
duce the letter book of, the board and
the letter that was written to Wetmore
Bros., announcing to them that there
would be a hearing on December 3,
1903, relative to the Woodward law,
was inspected.
Attorney Davis agreed that this was
the only notice of the hearing that was
sent to Wetmore Bros, and the book
went in as evidence. In the letter
Wetmore Bros, were notified to appear
before the Harbor Commissioners on
the date mentioned at a meeting to be
held "to investigate the alleged viola
tions of the law regulating the sale of
perishable products on the State
property."
"This," said Mr. Reinstein, "brings
up the question of the jurisdiction of
the Harbor .Commissioners off the
State's property. The act gi%-ee the
Commissioners jurisdiction only on
certain specified property. While the
affidavit of Graves applied to L.
Scatena & Co., in' no instance did that
testimony apply to Wetmore Bros.
This raises the other point, that the
plaintiffs in this case had no hearing
before the Harbor Commissioners as
contemplated by the law and no due
notice.
place other than on the State's prop
erty.
HE JESTS BEFORE ' DYING
Reinstein also asserted that the tes
timony that was taken by the Harbor
Commissioners on December 3, the
date when the Wetmore Bros, lost
their permit, was not sworn to. He
also read the testimony of John G.
Wetmore. from which it appeared that
Wetmore had denied to the board that
in transactions on the State's wharves
or property his firm had violated the
provisions that were made a part of
the permit, but that he had refused
to answer any questions concerning
the transactions of his firm at any
There was auite an array of legal
talent in the courtroom when the pro
ceedings took place. For the Harbor
Commissioners there were present At
torney General Webb, Judge E. A. Da
vis and W. H. Davis, the attorney of
jhe board. For the Wetmore Bros., and
incidentally for all the wholesale deal
ers in perishable products in this city,
there were in court J. B. Reinstein and
Oarret McEnerney. Commissioner
Spear and Secretary Foy of the Har
bor Commission were there, and also
John G. Wetmore- of TTetmore Bros.
and some ether wholesale dealers.
Mr. Reinstein at the opening read
the complaint in the injunction suit,
which covered the points that have
been previously published as given out
by the dealers as their claim in the
matter at issue. He read the affidavit
of Mr. Graves, a retailer, which was
received by the Harbor Commissioners
as testimony on the day that the board
revoked the permit of Wetmore Bros,
to sell, and the attorney said that in
this affidavit Wetmore Bros, were not
mentioned.
ARRAY OF LAWYERS.
In the papers that were put in as
evidence were included the letter in
vhich Wetmore Bros, were notified that
there would be a hearing on Decem
ber 3. 1903; the stenographic transcript
of the testimony that was taken on
December 3; the rules and regulations
of the Board of Harbor Commission
ers, and the notices that were sent out
by Secretary Foy of the Harbor Com
missioners to the Wetmore Bros, con
cerning tl:e revocation by the board of
their permit to sell.
The harpenincs of yesterday are
summed up in the statement that all
the record that was made by the Har
bor Commissioners on December 3 and
4 and the period immediately preced
ing while proceedings against the
wholesale dealers in perishable pro
d-ucts was in immediate View was in
troduced by counsel for Wetmore Bros.,
the plaintiff in the injunction suit on
trial, ar.d a date was then set for the
hearing of arguments, this being Janu
ary SQ, at 10 a. m.
The principal point that figures In
the contention of the wholesale dealers
a.Â« azainst the action of the Harbor
Commissioners is that the Commission
ers have under the Woodward law Ju
risdiction on the wharves and other
property of the State only, and that
they cannot interfere with sales or pur
chases of perishable products that take
place elsewhere. The Harbor Commis
sioners take a contrary view. Yester
day the Commissioners, by Attorney
Webb, made a general statement to
the court. It was set up in their be
half j.hat the hrrard has sole jurisdic
tion under the Woodward law and that
th-re is no legal provision by which
their acts can be reviewed by the court,
and particularly in proceedings such as
were then before the court.
. After these permits had been taken
away five others than those mentioned
in the foregoingâ nine concerns in all â
â¢uere deprived. Suits in injunction were
In srun. Stipulation was made that the
case of Wetmore Bros, should be tried,
and upon the decision in that case the
others shall depend. With this under
Â»-:anding proceedings have been sus
pended until the matters in court could
find decision. No ether permits have
been revoked.
ThÂ« first hearing in court relative
to the Woodward law. regulating the
5?ie of perishable products by permits
issued on certain conditions by the
Board of State Harbor Commissioners
to dealers, took place before Judge
Sloss in the Superior Court yesterday.
Some time &SQ the Harbor Commis
sioners revoked the permits that had
been issued to Wetmore Bros., L. Sca
tena & CV., McDonough & Runyon and
\\\>If & Sons. The dealers secured
temporary restraining orders from the
court to prevent the Harbor Commis
sioners from interfering with the pale
of products at places other than the
a harves and other property owned by
the State in this city.
Edward Leigh ton is a big hulk of a
man on whose soul rests the crime of
wrecking one good woman's mind and
making dark, in the days of youth, the
lives of five children. The story of his
crime is the old tale of drink and bru
tality, borne for years and years by
a weary .woman who thought that for
the sake of herself and her , children
the man she loved and married in her
youth might some time' reform. ' For
eighteen tearful years she struggled,
bearing five children in the meantime.
The eldest of them is a brave little girl
of 17 years, on whose shoulders rests
the responsibility of caring for four
children younger tjian she. One is a
boy of 12, and he is managing to help
his sister * to keep the younger ones
alive, "while the father spends .. ' his
wages in drunken carousals on the wa
ter front.
Wednesday last the patient little
woman who has mothered this pitiful
brood of children was consigned to Ag
news Insane Asylum because the tor
ture of her position" had undermined
her intellect. The eldest daughter was
Induced to take the necessary steps for
the proper care of her mother under
the utmost pressure of the authorities.
For days she pleaded that with her
slim hands she could make a living for
all of: them, if she could only be al
lowed to keep her mother within the
household. Finally she consented to
her mother's removal . to the asylum,
and the arrest of Leighton followed.
He had no excuse to make before
Judge Mogan yesterday for the life he
had wrecked and the five little cast
aways he had consigned to the turbu
lent sea of -life before they were old
enough to buffet the waves. He ad
mitted that he spent in drink what
ever money he earned and that the only"
time he disgraced the family domicile
by his presence was when he had no
money and no other place to sleep. He
was ordered into custody and will be
held until he can give a guarantee that
he will contribute to the support of his
little ones.
from the uncoverings of human frail
ties ia. Police courts centered around
Judge Mogan yesterday. He was the
victim of an ' automobile accident
Thursday night and had a narrow es
cape from death. His chauffeur and a
motonnan, both j going: at a high rate
of speedâ not s being under the warn
ing eye of the court to obey the laws
that prohibit racing-^disputed the right
of way with disastrous results to the
automobile and its occupants.
The Judge "sat on an air cushion dur
ing the session of his court and the
hearings: were conducted somewhat in
this fashion:' . ;
"You say, madam, that this man â
ouch!â tried to hit you in the eye andâ
curses,, on that motorman! â you ran
around the stove andâ woh!â tried to^â
geewhizl-f-avold him." ' .. Â¦â¢
v Somehow he managed to get through
the day without committing any one
for contempt and at the conclusion of
the session hobbled painfully from the"
bench. In, the corridor he was met by
Judge ~ Cabaniss, who advanced with
outstretched hand and a Florence Rob
erts expression . of sympathetic agony
in his eyes."
"That was going some, k-i-d," said
Cabaniss, and walked silently away/
There were many .versions of the ac
cident current around, the Hall of Jus
tice. One of, them was that Judge Mo
gan and the chauffeur met in the air
about forty feet above the colliding ve
hicles.
"I'll bet you $10 to $7," shouted the
Judge, "that I hit the ground first."
The chauffeur didn't take the bet, but
he would have lost anyway, because
the Judge was much the heavier and
beat the driver out by almost two
fifths of a second. . -

S. Jolley has purchased from James
Sweeney Ragged Actor, a promising
greyhound by, Fortuna â¢ Favente. Bril
liancy has been sold to G. G. Perry.
Men who have followed coursing for
many, years are unanimous in saying
they never before saw such strong
hares nor such exciting trials as have
been run recently. The managers of
the parks thought after the severe run
ning of last week that many grey
hounds would be in retirement this
week. Such was not the condition, how
ever, the entries being as numerous
as ever. This is probably explained by
the fact that the hares generally took
the hounds away in a straight line.
This does not hurt the dogs is much as
a twisting course, where there is sud
den stopping, starting and turning.

James Robinson has taken to the

to the disgust of the Southern Pacific
Railroad officials. He insisted on sleep
ing In the box cars that surround the
depot at Fourth and Townsend streets.
The special policemen warned him
away many times, but -he always re
turned. When they finally concluded to
arrest him he put up la wonderful fight
for a tuberculosis patient. It required
seven men to place him under arrest.
He told Judge Fritz yesterday that he
wanted to sleep in the open because his
lungs were very much, to- the bad. The
Judge thought that a little .confinement
in warm quarters mfghi aid In the
iheck of the disease, which apparently
had not fully developed., so, he sent Him
to the County Jail for thirty days.

Frank Drew, the ingenious "room
prowler," who made himself into a. call
boy when discovered by the sleeping
occupant of the rooA he was invading,
was held to answer to the Superior
Court yesterday by Judge Cabanfea on
two charges of burglary in bonds of
J2000 in each case. He entered the room
of Georse Wurster, at 219A Mason
street, last "Wednesday morning -while
darkness still covered the land, aad lit
a gas jet. The occupant awoke to the
sudden flood of light and Inquired what
was wanted. The nervy prowler told
him it was time to get up, turned out
the light and went away with the- coat,
waistcoat and trousers of the sleepy oc
cupant. He adopted the same tactics
with Walter G. Loring in a room at 103
Leavenworth street. In the glare of the
gas both men were positive they recog
nized the marauder, and their testi
mony was confirmed by the police, who
recovered from pawnshops certain arti
cles pledged by Drew that were identi
fied by Wurster and Loring as being
their property.

J. Lynch -ahtl.-'D." E. Brown was ap
pointed to confer with the Park Com
missioners in* regard to tne new ath
letic oval about to be constructed in
side the speedway in Golden Gate Park.
It is the wish of the association that
its. members should take some part in
the construction of the field.
The various athletic clubs through
out the Northwest are still anxious to
join the P. A.. A. Another letter was
received yesterday by Secretary Hauser
in regard to terms and expenses. It is
more than likely these clubs will be
admitted to membership within the
next few weeks.

pleasure of the majority.
Only two. representatives of the ama

of the 'association,, after, thinking the

would hardly be getting an even, br?ak
if the cape were taken up and decided
in their absence. ; "So, :.ft>r' a deal of

Next to Larsen the best saddle work
was done by Hildebrand, ' who rode
two winners.
Joe Yeager spent a profitable after
noon in the ring, taking away about
$9000 from his brother pericllers.
First Chip came in for strong back
ing to. win the first, race. Donovan
went over to the. post and got the
horse left. There is no excuse for
this sort of business and whenever a
boy gets left on a ! horse that is not
an* especially fractious actor : the
judges should send down to the Em- I
eryville cannery, for a big tin can. It
is a noticeable fact about racing that
'but few horses are left at ;the . post ]
when starts are made from in-.fron.t-of
the stand. Perhaps some retired rid
e"r now employed'.at some" other voca
tion can explain this.
,,The Call acknowledges the receipt
of a copy of Joe Ullman's, literary ef
fort, "What's the Odds?". The book'
is bound in cloth and contains some
clever stories of the turf.
The Fpllansbee handicap, with a
gross valuation of more than $4000, is
down for decision* at Oakland' this
afternoon. This is one of the richest
stakes of the season and there will
probably be ten or more, starters, ac
cording to the condition of the weath
er. Shot Gun, the Jennings =carck,
was assigned 140 pounds, but unless
it should rain, will not face thei bar
rier. Rockaway, Incubator, Arcade,
Hagerdon, Martinmas and Dainty are
among those carded to stajt.

A job left 'bunch of twefVe selling
platers lined up in. the mile and a six
teenth number. Larsen' astride Tom
Slaviri, -which closed esfuarchoice-with
Lapidus, again carried off, the laurels.
He waited in second position wftlT the
brown horse until, well into the stretch
and then in a drive downed Optimo
half a length. Lapidus retired after a
short engagement out in the lead.
Frank Woods was third.-
Johnny Schorr's colt Ananias scored
another set (ft brackets in the six and
a half furlong run for three-year-olds.
Ananias, with Hildebrand in the sad
dle, was held an 8 to 5 choice, and in
front from the start ran in more than
three lengths before Et Tu Brute at
the wire. Bell on Miss Betty succeeded
in getting knocked out of the race early
in the game.
With all due respect to Bell and his
ability or disability, it must be said he
has been playing in hard luck the past
few days.^He had the mount on Graft
er, which was plunged on ' to take the
final mile and seventy yard number,
and had the misfortune to break a stir
rup iron. Flush of Gold made all the
early running, but was apparently shor.t.
Joe Lesser, the second choice, piloted
by Larsen, led the Fresno mare out a
couple of lengths. Gorgalette ran a good
third.

The Overdue List.
The German bark Artemis, out 102 days
from Hamburg for Santa Rosalia, was rein
sured yesterday at 10 per cent^ . Since leaving
the German port nothlnc has been heard of
the vessel, and, as 1 she Is reputed a fast sailer,
the anxiety for her safety is greater than in
dicated by the rate of reinsurance. The rate
on the Martaban has been advanced to 15 per
cent. The Francesco Gulseppe I, La Fontaine
and Jeanne Cordonnler are quoted at 10 per
cent, the Loch Bredan at 80 and the Paris at
85 per cent. â¢

The British ship Eurasia, Captain
Hughes, which left here December 13
for the United Kingdom, arrived in
port for repairs last night. That
the Eurasia was in a bad plight
was known here because Captain Ren
nie of the steamship Mariposa sighted
her December 28 in latitude S0.35 N. f
longitude 126.57 W., and so reported.
The ..ailing vessel's main yard and
main topsail yard were gone and she
had evidently been pretty roughly
handled by the elements.
Captain Rennie changed his course
and steamed close enough to the Eu
rasia to signal an offer of assistance.
Captain Hughes ignored the Mariposa's
signals altogether and his discourtesy
was the subject of severe comment in
the local shipping world. Captain Ren
nie thought the Britisher was heading
for Honolulu and so reported upon his
arrival here.
On December 21 the main yard car
ried away and In coming down also
brought down the main upper and
lower topsail. The mainsail, lower top
sail and upper topsail and royal were
torn to rags. . The gear beeame so en
tangled that nearly everything had to
be cut away.
building was dropped exactly at noon to-day â
I. e . at noon of the 120th meridian, or at S
p. m., Greenwich time. J. C. BURNETT.

MINNEAPOLIS, Jan. 8. â James
Garfield of Hurley, Wis., locked the
door of his flat and told his -wife he
meant to kill her. Then he telephoned
to a friend to "hold the line and lis
ten." The friend heard a woman's
scream and three revolver shots.
When the police broke open the door
they found Garfield with a bullet in
his brain. The woman was dead. She
was a vaudeville artist known as Pearl
Guyotte.
Government Engineer Believes
That Shoaling 3Iay Recur
Unless There Be Dredging
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PORTLAND, Or., Jan. 8.â Because
the Columbi^ River bar pilots, whose
duty it is t\ take vessels across the
submarine sand mountain at the, mouth
of the .Columbia, have frequently re
ported that the famous obstruction is
wearing away by natural erosion, the
United States engineer's office here will
make a thorough investigation.
The bar pilots say . that soundings
show that there is a greater depth of
water on the bar now than ever before,
and it is possible that the great bar.
whlcA has cost the Government mil
lions of dollars in jetties and dredges,
â¢will be removed by the same natural
causes that placed it there. The Gov
ernment dredge Chinook has been at
work on the bar for some weeks since
l>er arrival from Saa Franciaco, and the
bar pilots believe that the dredge has
removed the hard^ crust on the bar and
that the obstruction is now wearing
away in the current of the river and
the tides.
Major Langfltt of the United States
engineers, however, thinks that if the
channel is really deepening the causes
must be purely natural, as the dredge
he says, has not had time to make a
real Impression on the bar.
".Shoaling is just as likely to recur
under these circumstances," he said,
"as deepening is likely to continue."

The North Yakima (Wash.) Republic prints
a report that the Russian Government has been
looking for 30,000 tons of Hay along Puget
Sound, presumably to be shipped to Manchu
ria. -to -be used In the event of a Russo-Jap
anese war. The paper, sees on to say that the
order could not be tilled at Seattle, but that
Portland had sufficient, supply to fill it. It
will be remembered that about a fortnight ago
The Call printed a rumor that the Russian
Government was nosing. . about Oregon and
Washington â¢ for large supplies of Barley, Oats
and . Hay,- but the rumor could not be sub
stantiated at that time. Since then, as al
ready mentioned, Russian agents have been
buying large line of. Alfalfa Hay in Nevada In
1000-ton lots, and under their purchases the
price ha a advanced from $5 to $15 per ton.
It may be that the Russians, falling to secure
Â¦upplies In Oregon and Washington, have gone
to Nevada for them, which would explain th>i
situation. The Hay market ls very, firm all
over the coast, and what with the Russian'de
mands up north and prospective demand from
Southern California later on. together with a
large and continuous demand en the San Fran-
Cisco market for interior. California points, the
market -Is steadily rising. Unless we get gfcod
soaking rains very shortly there Is no knowing
where Hay will ko to. .

cial strength of Baltimore and Ohio was due to
the report that application had been made to
list the stock on the Eerlin Boerse. There was
a movement in Mexican Railroad stocks, which
It was attempted to explain by the view that
Â»ar In the Orient would increase the demand
and the price for sliver and also' redound to
the b.iiefit of the Mexican exchange. The
Matf-irent of earnings of the Southern Pacltic

Ktock anU en Union Pacific. A gain in gross
e *" 1:ns ' s *" as *PP!Â« i mented by an important
reduction of operating Expenses, which con
Â¦Â£r d to Â«* thtr to the gain in net earnings.
l h" average of ntt earnings of railroads thus
far reported a decrease from November of last
year tor the nrtt time" in the year 1903. The
KTous turnings thus far reported for the fourth

lating. ThÂ£ governing quotation at the mo
ment is 32&c. though 34c Is still being re-'
allzed In a small way. and some dealers, fear
ing to be caught' with a Urge surplus, are
selling fine ranch down to 31c. Store Esss
are firmer and in Â¦ better demand than ranch,
as they are cheaper and almost as good at
this time of tha year, especially during cold
weather. -

. When Mrs. Knauer left her- alleged
husband Libbe in Chicago she came to
this city and was engaged by'Knauer as
a nurse. They were married in August,
1002.. After the marriage Knauer, who
was 73 years of age, made his 'will, be
queathing half, of his estate to' his wife
and half to his heirs. A feV'days later
he . took very sick and on the advice
of Dr. fimil Steltzner of .4234 Geary
street had an operation 1 performed. He
never recovered from thei shock, and
died January 11, 1903. Just before the
operation he changed the clause in his
will that gave half .to his , heirs and
gave the entire estate to Mrs. Knauer.

the marriage was illegal" ? ; and that

GRANTS DIVORCE TO WIFE
OF CONTRACTOR FOR CRL*ELTY
The application of Judse Lewis, one
of the trustees of the University of the
Pacific, to have the guardianship pa
pers in the case of Mrs. Sarah .Wood
ward, an incompetent, set aside and a
new guardian appointed 'Â¦ was denied
by Judge Coffey yesterday. The case
brought out some interesting develop
ments regarding the handling of coin,
and Mrs. Woodward's attorney promises
that there will be more interesting de
velopments. Yesterday's legal battle
centered around. the question whether
the aged woman's person and property
should be cared for by her relatives or
by the University of the* Pacific. At
present the relatives are given custody
of her person, but the trustees of the
University of the Pacific have a tight
hold on v.hat is left of the estate. H.
J. Parkison, her grandnephew, is the
. gaily anointed guardian whom the
attempt was made to haw removed on
the' .technical ground that the guardian
ship iJrocec-dinEs were held in San
Francisco, though the woman's legal
residence is in Santa Clara County.
Mn. Woodward, who is 84 years of
age, was piaccd on the witness stand,
and with feelxle -voice, her limbs shak
ing with age, "tfc-ld how the property
left her by her ."husband had gradually
slipped away until, as she said, "they
haven't even left jr.e a horse." She told
that the probity consisted of an inter
est in a ranch in Santa Clara County
and some real estate in Seattle. The
teal estate was itwumbered by legal en
tanglements, and" jn 1897 she employed
Attorney French of San Jose to
straighten matters out. He cleared up
the legal tangle, scW the property for
her and in return offered her an an
nuity of $50 a montli. About this time
she decided to make an endowment to
the Methodist church. She signed what
she understood was a trust deed, by
which she would retain possession of
her property during life, the trustees
acting as managers. She afterward
learned that she had actually deeded
the property away.
Mrs Woodward admitted that she was
in the habit of signing papers without
knowing their full import.
The witnesses in behalf of the ap
plicants all testified that no attempt
had ever been made to induce Mrs.

that she had done so voluntarily, with
the understanding that it be so invested
as to give her a good home for life. She
Â¦was moved from her lonely home on
the ranch and installed in a five-room
cottage at College Park, where she
could have medical attention and other
comforts. She always seemed happy
and contented at College P,axk, and had
asserted that she liked it because it was
so close to the church. Last Novem
ber she left, ostensibly on a visit, but
did not return. The next move made
was by her relatives, at whose instance
she was declared incompetent and a
guardian appointed.

er A. Madsen, was killed last Octo
ber by being struck by a falling block
and tackle at Seventh avenue and C
street, yesterday sued Charles A.

sen was working at the time of. the
accident, for $50,000 damages. John
J. Scheuer is suing the. firm of Ro
manl A Martini & Co. for $11,300

Mrs. Marie Knauer. the self-alleged
wife of the deceased Ferdinand Knauer,
had a fit of hysteria~yesterday morn
ing when .confronted with damaging
testimony in the way of j a document
which bore her signature as" the wife
of one August Libbe. This happened
in the suit to revoke probate proceed
ings in the will of the late Ferdinand
Knauer, a wealthy German, -by his
heirs. Â¦
The case came ud for trial- in Judge
Troutt's court, after having been con
tinued for several months. In an en
deavor to show that -Marie Knauer was
not legally the wife of Ferdinand
Knauer the attorneys for the contest
ants produced in .court a copy of a
marriage license issued to August D.
Libbe and Mrs. Louise Guttrich, which
was Mrs. Knauer's former name,: on
November 19, 1900. Mrs. Knauer, who
had previously denied her marriage to
Libbe, admitted that the license was
correct, but that no. marriage cere
mony had ever - been . performed. The
attorneys for. the contestants' hope to
prove that what is known as a com
mon law marriage was performed at
the time, and did in part* prove to that
effect. After Mrs. Knauer hadv again
denied with vehemence her. marriage
to Libbe, she was , confronted; with an
application for admission' to a German
social order. in Chicago which "bore in
three places the signature of Mrs.-Ma
rie .Libbe, and an application for a
life insurance policy by, Libbe- for', the
sum of $2000 made payable to his wife,
Marie Libbe. Attached 'to* the applica
tion of Mrs. Libbe for membership â¢ to
the German, society . was a deposition
stating, that 'She was aiidhad been' for
three months the /wife 6t August Libbe.
Mrs. Knauer.* was compelled Uo admit
that the signatures ;,were hers. â¢ She
seemed much .upset at being confronted
with the damaging, .documents^and
burst into, hysterical tears.' Such a
commotion, did- she raise that the court
was adjourned' until next Friday 'at 2
o'clock.- â¢ ;- *- V -; ,;.. -;*: i .\ 'Â¦"Â¦Â¦ \

ance in his saloon and" the four boys

they reached the corner of Russian av
enue, where they Awaited for Zanino.
When Zanino was passing the avenue
ithe boys rushed at hfnrand dared him
to fight them. Zanino .fought as well

scious. When he recovered conscious
ness he" alleges- he discovered that, his

Altogether the leap year dance was
the cleverest affair of the, year, and
distinctly the jolliest.
. The ; famous leap .year cotillon at
the Presidio has come and gone, leav
ing behind it many merry memories
and some few deep reflections. The
dance was exclusively in the hands of
the maids and matrons of the trinity
of posts about the bay, and for the first
time, in four years they knew how it
felt-to be free to ask the fellows they
liked best to go to the function with
them, and â radiant Joy â to ask them to
dance, or to let them fulfill the joyful
'role of wallflowers. However, the girls
disdained, to even old scores, and the
men- were asked to dance promptly and
often. And they were so coy in ac
cepting â "So sweet of you, Miss ,
to ask me, don't- you know."
"Well, it was great fun; This choos
ing, this new year law of selection was
a Joy thrice over. But alas! there
were the flowers and cab ' and ether
evening things to pay fcr â and that,
that, too, was the obligation of the
hostesses. Â¦â¢ And they made good, every
one. , .
â¢ The commanding officers. Colonel
Morris,' Colonel Garrard end Colonel
Noble, received the guests in the fa
mous old rriess hall and were assisted
by the following ladles: Miss Ethel
wynne Lewis, : Mrs. â¢ Patterson, Miss
Miss Morris, Miss Berry, Miss
Sweigrert. Mrs. Victor Lewis and Mrs.
Mlioon. .
