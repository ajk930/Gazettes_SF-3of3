KANSAS CITY. Mo., April 11.âPa
trons of the American Mercantile Com
pany, get-rich-quick concern,, who
went to the offices of the company in
the Hall building to-day found the
doors locked and the following notice
in bold letters posted conspicuously:
"Good-by, you suckers, good-by."
The American Mercantile Company is
said to have con here from St. Joseph,
Mo. Its business consisted of writing
contracts with small investors, who ob
ligated themselves to pay the associa
tion certain sums of money for eighty
weeks, at the end of which the investor
was to receive his money back with a
very liberal rate of interest.
The company's first contracts were
just beginning to mature and patrons
were demanding their money. Three
women who had paid in $2 a week for
eighty weeks, were among the disap
pointed visitors at the offices to-day.
They had come to cash their contracts
for 5260 each, the amount they had been
told they could draw.
From the volume of the concern's
mail it is estimated that the "suckers"
number 2000 or more and they are
scattered throughout the West. In
quiries as to the standing of the com
pany have come r<>rpntly from San
Francisco and Los Angeles, indicating
that the concern was operating as far
Weft as the coast.
Manager Shipley cannot be found.
P. C Phillips, attorney for the com
pany, said to-day that he had not seen
any of its members or ajrents for about
three weeks and he had no idea how
much money was outstanding on con
tracts. Phillips said that he believed
that the company could partially meet
its obligations.

OMAHA. April 11.â Two highway
men robbed the State Bank at Boelus,
Neb., early this morning by blowing
open the safe with dynamite, and, after
securine $4000 in bills and coin, made
their escape on a hand car, although
pursued for several miles by a posse
on a locomotive. The highwaymen
were cunning enough to carry with
them on the hand car a quantity of
axle grease, with which they greased
the rails in their flight.
Down grade the posse on the locomo
tive, in an exciting race, gained on
them rapidly and came within gunshot
distance. On the up grade the rails
were well greased, with the result
that the engine was stalled.
The robbers shot the hand car ahead
about eight miles and then ditched it,
making for the woods and foothills.
The posse, under the guidance of the
Sheriff, is searching for the outlaws
tA-night. but there is little chance of
overtaking thÂ«Â»m now, as the country
isj desolate and means of communica
tion 1/iadeq.uate. The chances are that
th<- robbers have escaped to another
railroad line with their bdoty.

CONVICTION
OF PACKERS
IS CERTAIN
Positive Prediction
of a Federal
Official.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, April 11.â One of the
highest Federal officials in Chicago de
clared to-day that the beef packers
cannot escape indictment and convic
tion.
"The Government," he says, "has
overwhelming evidence of the guilt of
the packing house combine. The pack
ers are guilty and the indictment and
conviction of all of them is certain. I
am artonished that men of unquestion
ed ability and business sagacity
should so far forget themselves and
their duties to the civil government
as to commit such surprisingly flag
rant offense against the Federal law.
Their guilt is established beyond the
shadow of a doubt. They cannot es
cape punishment.
"They have brought powerful pres
sure to bear upon the Government offi
cials, from President Roosevelt down,
an 1 are trying to forestall the Govern
ment in every movement. Influencing
witnesses in Chicago is not the only
measure they have taken to prevent
evidence of their guilt from being
placed before the Federal Grand Jury.
The packers are frantic. The Grand
Jury already has a plain case and the
investigation is not half over."
An investigation of the beef trust
of a much deeper nature and a wider
scope is to result from the examina
tion of the contents of eight trunks
taken yesterday from the safety vaults
in the First National Bank building.
When these trunks were opened the
entire secret transactions of the
Aetna Trading Company, a corpora
tion through which the secret busi
ness of the big packers was
transacted, was revealed to the jurors,
and as a consequence many new wit
nesses will be subpenaed. The
trunks and contents have been im
pounded on an order by Judge San
born, so that no one by legal process
can obtain possession of them.
OLD MAN WHIPS
PAIR OF THUGS

PORTLAND, April 11.â Colonel David
M. Dunne, a 65-year-old collector of in
ternal revenue, to-day in a tussle with
two toughs who tried to penetrate his
home beat both severely with a short
club and then threw them out into the
street.
For several weeks two men posing as
telephone inspectors have been obtain
ing entrance to private dwellings. Once
inside they did about as they pleased.
A number of women were frightened by
the pair. Colonel Dunne had heard of
the fellows, and when to-day he saw
two men sneaking into his back yard
he quickened his pace. When he saw
one, without knocking, attempt to open
the back door he picked up a short,
thick club, dashed up the stairs three
steps at a time and went straight after
his man, hitting him over the head and
shoulders. The other fellow, coming to
his partner's aid about this time, got a
sound thrashing in record time, and he
fled. The first hobo had no such luck.
He was picked up by the colonel and
thrown off the high bank on which the
house stands.

ROSA TORTURICI BELIEVES HUSBAND IS
HIDING SOMEWHERE IN CITY.
Woman Unnerved
in House of
Horror.
REVISITS THE SCENE
Declares She Did
Not See Blood
Before.
HOLDING SUSPECTS
Because the baby' needed a clean
dress Mrs. Rosa Torturici asked per
mission yesterday to visit \he Green
street house, where Biaggio Vilardo
was hacked to pieces â in her presence, j
say the detectives. For the little one's !
'sake she once more entered the place j
to which the unfortunate Sicilian, j
blinded by her charms, was led to i
slaughter. *
It was thought that when she en
tered the house a confession might be
extorted from her. District Attorney
Byington and Assistant District Attor
ney Louis Ferrari accompanied the
party, ready to make immediate use of
any information that might, be gained
from her if she yielded to superstitious
fear.
But the little woman gave them no
chance. Bhe only wanted clothing for
the baby, she said. They took her
through the hallway to 'rer bedroom
and she packed up a fei of the tiny i
dresses she had made with her own !
hands for the baby and pome of her j
own clothing, for she is a cleanJy little |
body.
The ostensible purpose of the visit
was that she might replenish the child's
wardrobe. But in the house she was
subjected to another ordeal. Through
Ferrari, District Attorney Byington
plied her with questions.
When she saw that another stern in
quisition was in progress the woman's
scowl of defiance deepened. Almost
word for word she told the District At
torney the same story she had told
Captain Burnett.
"My husband came through here,"
she said, pointing dramatically to the
door between the room where Vilardo
was hacked to pieces and the bedroom.
"The look upon his face was terrible.
"I said, 'Where is Vilardo? What has
happened?'
"He said, 'Never mind, woman, you
talk too much. Mind your own busi
ness.' "
The woman denied stoutly that she
knew what had taken place in the ad-
Joining room.
The blood stains on the sink were
called to her attention, and all she said
was, "Here is where I found them."
SHE ENTERS SI/AUGHTER PEN.
At a signal from District Attorney
Byington, Detective Taylor thrust open
the door that led to where Vilardo was
butchered. The woman started in ter
ror and seizing the baby, that had been
gleefully kicking up its heels upon the
bed, pressed the little one convulsively
to her breast.
"Por Dio â for Qod's sake," she mut
tered through her dry, trembling lips.
But she walked in, head erect and
wearing that defiant acowl of hers.
"Look at this," said the District At
torney, pointing to the horrible dark
stains on the uncarpeted floor. "Did
you ever see them before?"
"No," she said sharply, but her face
was pale as death, and she pressed the
infant so tightly that it complained.
"Did you ever enter this room since
Wednesday night?"
"No," she replied, and the defiant
scowl grew deeper.
Relentlessly, as though she were a
criminal in the dock, .District Attorney
Byington questioned the woman.
Though she had been ill in the morn
ing and had asked for medical attend
ance, she was composed enough as she
stood in that desecrated room.
With her small feet almost touch
ing the outlines of that dark spot on
the floor, she answered tersely all
questions put to her and with the same
air of sullen defiance.
"Do you think that your husband
has left town?" was asked.
"I do not know where he is," she
answered, "but I am certain that he
is not far away. I think that he is
somewhere in the city."
The police are of the same opinion â
not that they place any reliance in her
statement â but they have information
to that effect. Detectives Ed Gibson,
Bunner and Policeman J. Evatt, who
know more about the Latin quarter
than anybody else on the force, are
now scouring the district.
Detectives Tom Gibson, Wren and
Bunner went on a false scent to San
Jose yesterday. Word was received by
Chief Dinan that -an Italian answer
ing Torturici's description had been
seen near San Jose.
DETECTIVES GO TO SAN JOSE.
The three detectives went to that
city, and, with the assistance of Chief
of Police Carroll, visited every house
in the Latin quarter. Particular at
tention was paid to a place where a
Sicilian secret society had been ac
customed to meet, but it was deserted.
The detectives returned empty-handed.
The place where the brush that was
used to smear plaster of paris over
the blood-stained wall was bought
was located yesterday. It was yur

chased at 1516 Stockton street from T.
M. Riley, manager of August Carl's
general store.
Riley admits that the brush was
bojight there, but declares that it was
not purchased by Torturici. He says
that an excited Italian ordered the
brush the day after the murder. When
the news reached the store that blood
hounds were being used the Italian
snatched the brush and hurried away.
Riley knows Torturici and his wife
well. He declares that neither of
them bought the brush. Detective
Harrison, who located the store, is in
clined to believe that Riley is holding
something back from the police.
The funeral of Biaggio Vilardo will
take place to-morrow from Castagnet
to's undertaking parlors at 643 Val
lejo street. The body will be Interred
at Holy Cross Cemetery.
Chief Dinan attempted to locate
Governor Pardee yesterday to arrange
for the offering of a reward for the
capture of Pietro Torturici. The Po
lice Depatment will give $250 if the
State will offer $500. The matter has
not yet been arranged.
The police will search the schooner
Mizpah, due to sail for Alaska to
morrow with a number of Italians
bound for the salmon canneries.
While it is not thought that Torturici
will attempt to escape on the vessel.
Captain Burnett will take no chances.
The eight suspects who were ar
rested shortly after Vilardo's body
was found are still held at the City
Prison. The police are handicapped
in gathering evidence against them
because of the dread of the Mafia
that reigns in the Latin quarter. But
it is believed that they are part of
the gang that plotted the terrible
crime.
The men are silent when questioned
about the affair. Captain Burnett par
ticularly suspects Salvatori Maranda,
one of the accused men, a boon com
panion of Torturici. The plotters
have been frightened from their lair
near Fishermen's Cove, and it is
doubtful if any others will be cap
tured for some time.
District Attorney Byington may
present evidence to the Grand Jury
to-day that will cause that body to
indict Pietro and Rosa Torturici for
murder.

city or in near vicinity of it seems the
most plausible theory. The fact htat
he was seen on Montgomery avenue
Friday afternoon by Louis Cuneo and
> Joseph Bacigalupi, who have known
him for a long time, together with
other circumstances, leads Captain
Burnett to believe the alleged mur
derer is still in this city.
Louis Cuneo, who is a bartender at
the Owl saloon, 311 Montgomery
street, knew Torturici for many years.
The fugitive was a frequenter of the
saloon and had been in there but a few
days before the crime was committed.
Torturici was known to him as Peter
Torch. When Cuneo learned Saturday
that this was the man wanted by the
police he made known the fact of his
acquaintanceship to several of his
friends, who informed the police.
Later he and Bacigalupi were sum
\ moned before Captain Burnett to tell
their stories.
Cuneo says he was standing in front
of the saloon Friday afternoon about
4 o'clock, when Torturici eamo walk
ing down Montgomery avenue. He
held his head up, but as soon as
Cuneo's eye caught him he cast his
head down as if to evade being seen.
"I thought it unusual," said Cuneo
yesterday, "for Torturici to pass with
out saluting me. I did not pay any
more attention to the incident until
the next day, when I learned that he
was the man the police were hunt
ing.
"There was not the slightest chance
of my mistaking him. He had been
coming to the saloon a few times a
week to get drinks. I also worked with
him at the American Can Company's
factory.
"Torturici was a rather peculiar fel
low, never saying much. He did not
speak very good English and he never
seemed to improve in American ways.
One particular feature, which a per
son who knew him would recognize
him by, was that his left eyebrow ap
peared to be higher up than the other.
He was not a man you would get fa
miliar with, as he ralked but little.
During the time he was working for
the can company he was offended by
other employes, but would never de
fend himself.
'A week ago Sunday he came in
here with Salvatori Maranda and
played :t game of cards. Torturici was
stuck for the game and he wa? given
credit for the drinks. Maranda was
the only man I knew him to (be

the British steamship Daventry, al
though wrecked in the United States,
sold to an American and twice repaired
at an expense of more than three
quarters of her cost,' is denied American
registry. This case has attracted con
siderable attention, among . shipowners
and makes an important precedent.'-*
pa January 20, 1903, the Daventry
grounded off Cape Fear, was towed to
Newport News and repaired at a cost
of $42,000. In December of the following
year she grounded off Hunting Island
light and was again repaired at New
port NewÃ at a cost of $14,000. Last
January the British owners sold her to
a citizen of the United States for $71,
000. American registry was applied for
under the statute providing for such
enrollment for any foreign built vessel
whenever such vessel is wrecked in the
United States and purchased and' re
paired by a citizen of the United States,
provided such repairs amount to three
fourths of the cost of the vessel.
Attorney General Moody in his deci
sion say 6:
If repairs occasioned by two disasters may
b* aggregated, it follows that the repair oc
casioned by ten different' wrecks may be ag
gregated. The samÂ» part of the vessel may
have hffn injured on each occasion so that
when the repairs occasioned by the last wreck
have beÂ«n completed nine-tenths of the vwgel
may Â«yen thÂ«n be, foreign built instead of one
fourth, which the statute contemplates. It
may be urged that the aggregate of the vari
ous euros expended by her owners upon her
repair* equals threÂ«-fourths of her value, but
the answer to this argument is found in an
analysis of the statute which conclusively
shows that the Inducement, of American reg
istry was offered for thÂ« practical rebuilding
of the vessel In ,the~llnlted States.

ADMIRAL OF BALTIC
FLEET STILL HAS ALL
THE WORLD GUESSING
NO TRACE OF BATTLESHIPS
Theory Advanced That They May Have
Slipped Past Singapore Some
Dark Night
LONDON, April 12.â A dispatch from
Jibutil, on the gulf of Aden, to the
Daily Mail says:
"Vice Admiral Nebogatoff's squadron
has been seen cruising near Socorota. It
is reported to be awaiting reinforce
ment* from the Black Sea fleet."
Socotora is an island in the Indian
Ocean 120 miles east of the eastern ex
tremity of the African continent.
The mystery of Vice Admiral Rojest
vensky's whereabouts is still unsolved,
and speculation on the possibilities is of
the keenest. The favorite hypothesis
of the newspapers this morning is that
his six battleships slipped past Singa
pore some night with lights out.
The Daily Telegraph's Singapore cor
respondent, cabling under date of April
11. says:
"All reports, to the contrary notwith
standing, only one battleship, the Sissoi
Veliky, passed here Saturday. No ships
or" the Cesarevitch type were with the
squadron."
The correspondent at Kobe of the
Daily Telegranh says:
"A telegram from Peking states that
Rupfiian Minister Leasar asked China
to lend Russia a port in Pekiang, but
China absolutely refused."
JAPANESE LAND OPERATIONS.
Attempt to t'Ht Slav Communications
With Vladivostok.
GUNSHU PASS. Manchuria, April 11.
The thaw has been followed by a fierce
gale, svhich has dried out the mire and
is now raising a heavy dust. It is a
providential change, as otherwise the
troops tenting in ihe mud probably
would soon have been subject to aick-
BCBS, even in epidemic form.
It is steadily becoming more evident
that first calculations as to the Russian
losses in the battle of Mukden were ex
aggerated. A portion <>f the Fifth Rifle
Regiment, which was cut off at Muk
den, lias just arrived at Kirin. having
succeeded in penetrating the Japanese
line?.
Chinese state with great positiveness
that General Kawamura's army, sup
ported by General Nogi's army, is mov
ing in a northeasterly direction, aiming
to cut the Russian communication*
with Vladivostok. According to tht
same sources 30.000 Japanese landed at
Dalny on March 88. and it is reported
that six additional divisions are form
ing in Japan to operate against Vladi
vostok and Saghalien.
The Manchurian Chinese have adopt
ed an attitude of positive hostility to
the Russians. A body of 500 native
horsemen fired upon Russian troops at
the village of Chendi. and Manchurian
militia \r said to be taking the field on
the side of the Japanese on the Hun
River. The leader, Fulingo, has been
appointed commander of the militia at
Kaiyuan. but a force of Chinese regu
lars is stationed along the border of
Mongolia wtyh the object of preserving
neutrality.
The Japanese now occupy the line
of Sylzyatji, Ohangtufu and Katpan
gomu. and the impression prevails here
that the direct advance from the south
has halted for the present at that line.
There were a number of skirmishes
last week between Russian and Japa
nese scouting parties, but no action of
serious consequence.

SPOKANE. April 11. â Despite the
presence of the whole male population
of Salmo River Valley at the railway
station, thirty-two Chinese and Jap
anese, who heretofore have been
afraid to work in the sawmill at Sal

chines which white men had been run
ning:. Their presence means the de

Further trouble with the Orientals is

mood, the women being particularly
savage in denunciation.
The Orientals were brought from
Kelson. B. C, in charge of two magis
trates and eight or ten provim ial po
lite. The array of "bobbies" was
enough to awe the white men and the
aliens went peaceably to the mill,
where, after a slight disturbance, the

sessed by certain diplomats here on the
subject Indicates clearly that the char

WASHINGTON, April 11.â Joseph L.
Bristow. special investigator for the
President on the future of railway
rate?, by reason of Government
ership of the Panama railroad, con
ferred to-day with the kcMM
War.
Bristow is reported to hold that
eminent ownership of a steamship lin*
from Colon to New York la
ive check on railways and sten
lines doing business with either San
Francisco and New York, or with both.
It. can also be said that the Govern
ment proposes to hold on to th-
steamship line on the East coas 1 .
is now inclined to equip a line !â 
West coast. It is contended, ho \
that this is a matter which can
scarcely be handled by the Isthmian
Canal Commission and that it will be
put up squarely to the Preside::
his return.
It developed to-day from a hi^h
source that the apparent comp^*"
between the Pacific Mail Steamship
Company and lines from the South to
Panama was really not competitiw
and that, in fact, the lines constituted
a trust. Investigation has shown that
there was a sameness in the charts
which could be explained by no other
theory than that of a trust.

WASHINGTON, April Iâ John F.

shovels were at work in the Cul^bri
exeavatk ns and arrangements ha<l
bwn made to install aditional machines
at thfe rate of two a month.
Th* health of the young Americans
on the isthmus is particularly good.
There has been very little sickness and

GRA>T> OPERA STAR WHO SCORED A SENSATIONAL, SUCCESS AS KUNDRY LAST NIGHT AT HER INITIAL APPEAR
ANCE IN SAN FRANCISCO. A FLOWER MAIDEN AND THE LEADER OF THE ORCHESTRA AT YESTERDAY'S
SPLENDID PRODUCTION OF "PARSIFAL." â¢ \
the more strenuous of the climaxes It
falls somewhat short in brilliance and
power. But the Fremstad organ is
powerful, true, easily produced, and
with its sweetness also amply sufficient
to the dramatic need.
And this Is only the beginning of
Miss Fremstad's Kundry. A? she
came on, supple, leopard-like, eyes
gleaming like a tiger cat's, one dis
covered a temperament. It quivered
in every lithe line of the body as the
Kundry, wearied in her search for the
healing balsam, lay sullenly resting*
among the knights. It imposed itself
ever more strongly throughout the
scene. Then came the temptation and
with it the Fremstad triumph.
The dress began it. It takes a Frem
stad to evolve a dress like that.
"rouge degrade" greens of all sorts,
soft, silken, supply clinging to the sup
ple body, the skin of a tiger drawn
across the bosom, the flaming hair
twined audaciously with fiercer Jew
els, a flaming ruby set in serpent fash
ion upon the gleaming arm â so, Frem
stad lay upon her couch of roses. Mag
nificently, she hardly looked at the sim
ple youth she was luring to destruc
tion. Singing gently, eyes dreaming
back over centuries of conquest, she lay
there, imperially sure of herself. "Rose
of Hell," indeed, as Wagner has called
her. Not less uncanny and victorious
\vaf= h^r more intimate wooing of Par
sifal, with its strange mingling of the
mother and siren. Her rage and grief
at her failure to move the youth were,
too, brilliantly depicted.
It is one of the events of this bril
liantly eventful season and incompar
able after its fashion. As to the rest,
the whole performance went more
smoothly than Friday's, except for
Mr. Klingsor's castle that balked as
it went to the wings. And, by the way,
though Bayreuth may know a thing
or two about dark changes, the
'Mother Goose" folk knew another or
two. The scene of the change from
the flower garden to the desert is very
palpably handled, for example, as the
change from Klingsor's castle to the
garden.
Mr. Burgstaller and Mr. Van Rooy
gave each magnificent performances,
so Mr. Goritz, and for me the second
"Parsifal" left only a vivid appetite
for a third.
To-night is "La Gioconda," with
Caruso the magnificent, and Nordica
the splendid, not to speak of Bcotti.

RED LETTER JJIGHT IN OPERA.
"Parrffal" Draws Greatest House
Financially Known in City's
History.
Every seat in the Grand Opera-house
from pit to dome was taken last night,
it was the greatest night, from a
financial standpoint, known in the his
tory of this theater. Crowds thronged
the vestibule as early as 5 o'clock
trying to buy admissions for the sec
ond part of the performance, which
began at 8:45. Not a seat was to be
had, and nearly 2000 persons were
turned away.
The audience was by far the most
brilliant of the season. Pull dress was
the order of the night, and this ex
tended away up into the top floor. The
gowns of the women were magnificent
and the display of Jewels was dazzling.
The foyer, during the entire act, was
crowded with the representative men
of the city, and many of the leading so
ciety favorites among the fair sex also
mingled in the crowd.
Charles W. Strine, the local manager
of the San Francisco season of the
Conried Metropolitan Opera Company,
said last night:

a standard in this particular that will
probably never be equaled In this city.
"It proves, as nothing else could pos
sibly prove, a fact that I have stated
ever since my first experience with the
San Francisco musical public in the
Melba engagements of 1898 and 1899,
that San Francisco is the greatest
musical city of its size in the world.
"No other city of its population and
environment can even compare with it
in musical taste, musical enthusiasm
and the splendid manner In which
really great musical enterprises are
welcomed by the public. Such support
Is a credit to the city, and a great
credit to Its people."

GOLDBERG SAYS HIS ACTS
HAVE BEEN ONLY OFFICIAL.
Declares That He Worked With No
Firm to Help Settle People
on Lands.
Con H. Goldberg, United States
commissioner at Covelo, Mendocino
County, who was accused of using his
official position to aid agents in set
tling people upon lands in Round Val
ley, says he has been, unjustly ac
cused. In regard to Van Sweden, who
made charges against him, he says he
will forfeit $500 if he cannot prove
the allegations untrue.
Goldberg declares he did not aid
Chatfleld & Vinzent to settle people
upon the lands, as alleged. Further
more, he explains that the lands un
der his jurisdiction are in no way con
nected with the Indian lands. There
are thousands of acres of vacant Gov
ernment land in Mendocino, Trinity
and Humbildt counties, he says, that
have been overlooked because of their
inaccessibility and it is these he has
in charge as commisisoner.
Goldberg says he has at all times
kept within his official duties regard
ing the location of lands and refers
to several prominent people in his lo
cality and this city as to his standing.

CLINGS TO BOAT
FOR FOUR DAYS
Captain Cutter of the steamship
Wellington, which arrived last night
from Nanaimo, reports that he picked
up a Japanese who had been standing
on the bottom of an upturned fishing
boat for four days in the Gulf of
Georgia.
During that period the Japanese had
neither food nor water. The weather
was rough at the time and great seas
were constantly swashing over the up
turned boat. ,
Fortunately for the fisherman, when
the boat was capsized the center board
was down, and as the boat was thrown
over the gearing of the center board
got caught in the sail, which held it
in place. To this the poor fisherman
clung. When taken on board the Wel
lington he was completely exhausted.
He said:
My name is Tueko, and I am a Japanese. I
left Nanaimo with my brother to go out fishing
in a boat. We ran into rough weather from
the start and our boat was tossed about right
and left. Finally we were struck by a ter
rible squall, and the boat Trent over. At that
time my brother was lashed to one of the
seats tn the boat, and when she went over he
must have been instantly drowned. I swim
about for a while and finally got on top of
the upturned boat. The wind was howling
and the seas were raging furiously at the time.
As soon as I got on the boat I grabbed hold
of the centerboard. The suffering I experi
enced while standing on the upturned boat
cannot be described. I was constantly
drenched. It was freezing cold. I saw ves
sels several times, and shouted and made sig
nals with an oar. but until the Wellington
came to my relief no one apparently saw me.
It is Impossible to tell the terrible experience
I have been through.
The Wellington was eighty-six hours
from Nanaimo. She brings 2406 tons
of coal, consigned to the Western Fuel .
Company.
EDUCATOR KIRK MAKES
REPLY TO ALLEGATIONS
Declares That J. H. Strine's Accusa
tion Is Without Founda
tion in Fact.
State Superintendent of Schools
Thomas J. Kirtk arrived yesterday from
Fresno to attend the meeting of the
State Board of Education to-day at
the Palace Hotel. Relative to the
published statement made by J. H.
Strine, former secretary of the State
Text Book Committee, to the effect
that the declaring of that office vacant
was caused by improper motives on
the part of Mr. Kirk, the latter had |
this to say:
Mr. Strine's accusation is utterly without '
foundation of fact. The principal cause that '
led to the declaring of his office vacant waÂ»
lack of money In the school textbook fund to
pay his salary. Another reason was the ab- (
sence of a demand for the services of a sec
retary. Again, the relations between Mr.
Rtrine and myaelf were not cordial. The let
ter which he has addressed to the several
members of the State Board of Education I
will answer In detail at the meeting to-mor
row, although I do not consider that it is a
matter for review by the board, as the Text
book Committee is authorized by law to em- ,
ploy or discharge Its secretary without con- ,
suiting the State board. But I have nothing
to conceal or apologize for, and will willingly
tell my colleague* of the board all the In
formation I have concerning the matter.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
COFFEYVILLE, Kans., April 11.â
Mrs. Adeline Spears died last night at
her home in this city. She. was 54 years
old. She lived in a two-room hut with
her husband, who is a day laborer. Just
before she died she called for a lawyer
and made a will, leaving $40,000 in cash
to her husband. The money, she de
clared, was on deposit in a bank in
Oakland, Cal.
The woman and her husband have
lived here seventeen years. They al
ways have been in very poor circum
stances. Mrs. Spears had often spoken
to her neighbors about a legacy her
father had left her, held in trust for her
by her stepmother in an Oakland bank.
It is thought very strange that she did
not claim the money before. She re
fused to give her reasons for not claim
ing the money. She was married to
Harvey Spears in Newton, Kans., in
1886.
Letters found bear out the woman's
assertions that she had the money.

SnÂ«cial Disoatch to The Call.
VALLEJO, April 11.â The U. ft S.
Boston left Mare Island this afternoon.
After adjusting compasses in the lower
bay she will start for Honolulu. The
Boston will return early in May and
go to Portland, where she will remain
during the Lewis and Clark Exposi

This pleasant duty has been sought
by several of the ships of the Pacific
squadron. It was given out at Mare
Island shortly after the Boston's ar
rival here from Panama several weeks
ago that she would sail to Honolulu
to a<t as the station ship there, re

the killing of Benjamin Hargis.
Marquis Will iru to
Regain Respect
for Familu-
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Aoril 11â One of the first
acts of the new Marquis of Anglesey
has been to restore the old Welsh
name of PlaÂ» Newydd to the family
seat, which the late Marquis had re
christened Anglesey Castle. This is re
garded as Indicative of his purpose to
re-establish the prestige of a noble
family which was brought into Ig
nominy and contempt ftjr the frail, de
generate and reckless spendthrift who
died a bankrupt exile at Nice. Between
the new peer and the effeminate dandy,
who solaced himself in the last wâ Vs
of his wasted life by knitting homely
comforters and making bead bags, the
contrast Is a striking one.
The physiognomy of the late Marquis
proclaimed his weakness of will and ir
responsible temperament. His suc
cessor, though only In his twentieth
year, possesses a singularly mature
face, with a broad, intellectual fore
head, a firm mouth, a decisive chin and
clear, penetrating eyes. The fact that
he is little known in societyâ has never
cut a dash and ignores and is ignored
by the fast setâ augurs well for his
future career. What special form of ;
activity he will go in for ia not known.
It Is exDected that he will live quietly
for s>nme years repairing the misman
agement of his predecessor and making
his 30.000 acres again one of the best (
paying properties In the kingdom.
As a cousin of the profligate whom
ha succeeds, he escapes that fearful :
penalty of heredity which visits the j
sins of the fathers upon the children.
HiÂ« full name Is Charles Henry Alex- Â»
ander Paj?et. and he is the eldest son of
the late Lord Alexander Victor Paget. ;
His mother is srtill living. He ha.
beautiful sisters. Lady H*rb*>rT. who
married Lord Pembroke's eldest son
last year, and Lady Ingestre, who mar
ried Lord Shrewsbury's eldest son at
the same time. He has no sweetheart
as yet. but when he gets his property
in proper shape, yielding an income of
$500,000 a year, he will be a great catch.

DECLARES HIS INNOCENCE
Indicted Oregonian Ap
pears and Pleads
Not Guilty.
Attacks Legality of the
Jury That Made
Accusations.
PORTLAND. Or.. April 11. â JudgÂ«
gers court was crowded to-day
the time arrived for Senator
" ' ' hell to plead to the four in
ents found against him by the
ral Grand Jury.
In a plea of abatement Senator
Mitchell challenged the acts of the
Federal Grand Jury by charging
that Jurors W. E. Robertson and Carl
Phelps. the original foreman and sec
retary respectively, had been legally
excused for the term pending the in
vestigations; that Jurors Frank G.
Buffum arid George Peebler had been
some time after the Grand
had been impaneled: that Juror
c? Gustin was not a citizen of the
rttes; that Jurors Frank Bol
ter and Joseph Essner were not tax
re, as required by law. and that
ict Attorney Heney was disquali
fied in many ways, besides being pre
;udiced.
Judge Alfred S. Bennett of The
Dalles, as attorney for Senator Mitch
r.nounced that there was a ques
â¢>f moral turpitude involved in
the caae wherein Senator Mitchell is
accused of accepting $2000 from S.
A. D. Puter and therefore he would
valve all legal technicalities and be
ready to proceed to trial without de
lay uron the issues at stake. Mitch
waiver of all technicalities in the
Puter case is looked upon as a shrewd
on the part of his attorneys to
proceedings In the Krebs mat
~d to secure a trial upon the Pu
â¢<Â»r case, which is admittedly the
weaker of the two.
Judge Bennett entered a plea of
guilty for the Senator in three of
ases against him â two for con
y under section 5440 of the Re
- *utes and one under section
or accepting money while hold

How to
Get Well.
Every organ of the body is
directly connected with the
brain by nerves. The nerve
cells in the brain generate
nerve â power â and send
it to the organ through these
nerves, and this nerve-force
gives life and action. The or-
pans work perfectly when there
is sufficient nerve power. Lack
of nerve force weakens the ac-
tion of an organ and it works
imperfectly â becomes sick.
Two-thirds of ail sickness is
thus due to weak or deranged
nerves; it is therefore advisa-
ble to take Dr. Miles' Restor-
ative Nervine, because it makes
nerve energy.
When you cure the nerves
you remove the cause, and
that's the way to get well.
"Dr. Mile*' Restorative Nervine
cured me of nervous prostration after
every other effort bad failed to give
tne relief. My trouble seemed to
begin with a general loss of strength
and a breaklnr down of the nervous
cystem. I Buffered from headache,
constipation and fluttering or palpita-
tion of the heart. My appetite failed
and I was so nervous and restless- that
I could not sleep at night. My hus-
band who Is a druffsrlst. brought me
a bottle of Nervine. It helped me -
from the start, and I continued usin*
it -.til I had taken six bottles. My
health was completely restored."
MRS. SILA M. MOREHOUSE.
North Adams, Mich.
Dr. Miles' Nervine Is sold by your
drugolst, who will guarantee that the
-st bottle will benefit. If It falls, he
will refund your money.

Special Dispatch to Tha Call.
TACOMA, April 11.â The Supreme

Hartley, an eccentric South Bay
pioneer, who left the bulk of his $40,000
estate to tha Olympia public schools,

ance of $2000. The higher court finds

lepsy for fifteen years and while mak
ing hie will went Into an epileptic
spasm lasting half an hour. When he
regained consciousness he signed the
will.

Special Dlsnatt-h to The Call.
OMAHA, April 11.â In one of the
greatest beef and pork packing centers
of ths world, where meats of every
kind are plentiful, it has been found
that in many families horseflesh has
been served on the tables. But the din
ing on this vivand was not intentional.
Some of the butchers on the outskirts
ol the city hit upon the idea of substi
tuting horseflesh for beef, since the
strike at the packing-houses sent up
the price of meats, and the imposition
was not discovered until to-day.
The police say they have in their
possession evidence that horseflesh has
b?en made into sausages and steaks.
The carcasses of slaughtered horses
were found near the suburb of Benson.
The hind-quarters had been removed
with a butcher's cleaver and saw. The
carcasses were fresh.
The police hr been working up evi
dence from a similar find in another
part of the city three weeks ago.
Th* residents of Benson threaten to
lynch the butchers transacting busi
ness ii their town if it is found that
horseflesh was palmed off upon them
for beef. The discovery, backed by
the statements c-f the police, has cre
ated considerable excitement in the lo
calities where the slaughtered horses
were found.

DIE AS LOVERS
IN THEIR NOVEL
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, April 11.â History re
cords many instances of authors driven
to despair and suicide by the rejection
of their manuscripts, but at Eger, in
Hungary, Johann Kelemen and Irma
Toronyi. two young school teachers,
promptly sought death on the publi
cation of a story in which they had
collaborated. It seems they were in
love with each other, but their par
ents would not consent to their mar
riage. In the form of dramatic love
romance they wrote the story of their
blighted lives, in which they figured
under assumed names. In the story
the hero and heroine finish up by
committing suicide. The love-lorn
couple sent it to a newspaper and
agreed that when it was published
they would put an end to their lives.
Unfortunately they did not have to
â wait long enough to give them a
chance to repent their foolish resolu
tion. On the day that the story ap
peared they were found shot through
the heart lying on a bed covered with
flowers. The girl, it would seem, had
first killed her lover and then termi
nated her own existence just as de
scribed in the story. In Kelemen's
pockets was found a letter addressed
to his parents and those of his sweet
heart begging as a last favor that they
might be buried in a common grave.
If their manuscript had been rejected
they might have been alive to-day.
The latest Chicago author repre
sented by a book in London is Miss
Evelyn Gladys, whose work, entitled
"Thoughts of a Fool," has been pub
lished here simultaneously with its
appearance in the United States and
has received critical attention from
Marriott Watson in the Mail an" 3 from
a good many other writers.
MORE HUGO WRITINGS.
Most renders will be surprised to hear
that parts of "Les Miserables" and
"The Toilers of the Sea," originally
suppressed by Victor Hugo, are now in
existence. Moreover, these omitted
pages are about to be published in a
new edition de luxe of Hugo's writings,
which is now being prepared in Paris.
They are to be printed ln the new
edition in the form of appendices. Thus
"Les Miserables" will have a new pre
face and a new chapter, and "The Toil
ers of the Sea" a new descriptive study
called "The Sea and the Wind." "Ruy
Bias" will have a hundred new lines
and "Les Burgraves" six hundred, in
cluding a prologue. "Marie Tudor"
will have an entirely new act. It is also
intended to print notes from Victor
Hugo's manuscript, in which he re
corded the genesis of his works, as
well as a number of quaintly original
pen and ink sketches with which he
illustrated them.
William Le Queux's recent appear
ance in Florence in the capacity of
thief-taker was eminently character
istic of that facile writer of detective
stories. Le Queux, who invariably win
ters in Florence, was riding in a horse
car the other dv.. when he felt a
steaHhy hand slip into his pocket. He
pounced upon the thief promptly, held
him securely until a policeman could be
summoned and then accompanied his
captr-e, whose name proved to be Pas-
Berini. to the station house. Next day
Le Queux. who speaks Italian fluently,
appeared in court against the pick
pocket and aroused much mirth by
askfng the Judge to pronounce a severe
sentence on Passerini on the ground
that if the latter had read his books
he would not have allowed himself to
be captured In such a stupid manner.
The pickpocket was given fifteen days.
CORNER IX MANUSCRIPTS.
During the last few years there
have been a good many signs that the
literary remains of great writers of
the last century are being "cornered"
and experts see an additional proof of
this tendency In the uncommonly
high prices paid for Thackeray and
Keats manuscripts at Sotheby's the
other day. For only eighteen pages
of the original manuscript of "Pen
dennis" Mr. Quaritch, who represents
many wealthy bibliophiles, gave
$1450. It is true that one of the
pages contained two drawings by
Thackeray for General Washington
and General Bonaparte, but these ad
ditions do not account for the surpris
ing valuation. The previous lot, con
sisting of only thirteen pages of
Thackeray's notes for a lecture on
'The Four Georges," were purchased
by B. F. Stevens, the American agent,
for $995. Six rough pencil and pen
illustrations to "Pendennis" brought
*260.
The Keats manuscripts sold were
the original draft of "The Pot of Ba
sil," and ot)e of "I Stood Tiptoe Upon
a Little Hill" â the prelude to "En
dymion" â in the handwriting of
George Keats, the poet's brother.
These manuscripts also were bought
by Quaritch who paid $1075 for
them.
The death hag Just occurred in Par
is of Louis Depret, who translated
Longfellow's "Evangeline " into
French and was a friend of Dickens
and Charles Lamb. He was 68 years
of age.
A thousand dollars seems to be a
pretty big sum to pay *for a blank
page, but that is what one brought
at a London auction room the other
day. To be strictly accurate one
should say that its presence in an old
book increased the volume's selling
price just that much. The book in
question was a first edition of the
"Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia."
written by Sir Phillippe Sidnei and
printed in 1590. Onh* three other cop
ies are known to be in existence and
none of them has ever brought more
than $1250. But this particular spec
imen contained an extra blank page
appended to the dedication, which
rendered it unique. Presumably it is

WILL DISCUSS
GAMBLING VICE
OAKLAND, April 11.â An open pub
lic discussion of the various methods
and phases of gambling, in which the
gambler himself will have an equal
voice with the opponents of the prac
tice, will be held next Thursday eve
ning, April 13, at Alcatraz Hall in West
Oakland, under the direction of the
pastors of the three Protestant
churches of that section of the city.
It is not the purpose of those in charge
of the meeting to discuss the question
of gambling from the standpoint of
the churchman, but rather to eliminate
all sentiment, and to engage in a
friendly, broad-minded discussion of
both 6ide6 of the question.
The meeting next Thursday evening
Is one of a series of regular weekly
gatherings, arranged as a continuation
of the recent evangelistic campaign,
and is in charge of the Rev. Dwight
E. Potter, pastor of the Union Street
Presbyterian church, the Rev. J. C.
Bolster, pastor of the Chester Street
M. E. church, and the Rev. H. F. Bur
gese, pastor of the Second Congrega
tional church. In explaining the pur
pose of the discussion of gambling to
day, Mr. Bolster said:
"We simply wish to have those who
attend the meeting engage in an hon
est open public discussion of the ques
tion, and we extend an invitation to
every one, especially gamblers, to at
tend. There will be no sentiment and
no abuse of any one. It is not our pur
pose to discuss the question from a
ministerial standpoint."
A series of questions has been pre
pared by those in charge, for discus
eion at the meeting, and people inter
ested in the subject are also requested
to send in answers by mail.
Judge Hall Congratulated.
OAKLAND, April 11. â Judge S. P.
Hall, who has been appointed to the
District Court of Appeals by Governor
George C. Pardee, was the subject of
congratulation by many friends who
crowded into his chambers at the
Courthouse * here to-day to express
their good wishes. He is pleased with
the appointment himself and showed
by his talk that he appreciated the
honor.
In speaking of his new position he
said: "I appreciate this honor be
cause it came to me unsolicited. We
five Judges in the Governor's home
county agreed to make no fight for
the position, but to allow our name?
to go before him without indorsement
of any kind and we all stuck to our
agreement. Coming in the way it has,
I am delighted."
There was some question whether
the appointment had not disqualified
Judge Hall from proceeding with the
hearing of a case before him and it
was continued to-day until the matur
could be looked into. By a stipula
tion, however, it was agreed that ne
should finish the hearing to-morrow
and the case will proceed until fin
ished before him.
TELLS OF DISCOVERIES.
BERKELEY, April H. â Professor
C D. Perrine. the astronomer at Lick
Observatory, who discovered the sixth
and seventh satellites of Jupiter, lec
tured to-night at the students' ob
servatory of the University of Cali
fornia on his notable astro
nomical work. Professor Perrine ex
plained the methods employed in
the discovery, in searching 1 for the
satellites and verifying the work. The
value consisted not in the novelty of
the discovery, but in the splendid
data obtained to carry on astronomi
cal investigations, said the lecturer.
The satellites were, at one time, part
of planetary systems, continued Pro
fessor Perrine.
The discovery -was not an accident,
but the result of systematic research.
It could not have been accomplished
before the Crossley reflector was in
stalled last November at Lick Obser
vatory. The satellites were found
by photography. Night after night
successive plates were made of the re
gion about Jupiter, careful compari
sons of the negatives being made, to
gether with careful and elaborate
mathematical demonstrations. The
diameter of the sixth satellite is about
]00 miles, that of the seventh being
less than thirty-five miles. Professor
Perrine illustrated his lecture with
stereopticon slides.

prepared for the successful candidates
at the election yesterday was held to
night in West Berkeley, all the new of
ficials of the town being present, with
members of the Republican City Cen
tral Committee. Short speeches were
made by each of the men who are to

that has been in evidence during the
campaign was apparently complete.
The committeemen from the First
Ward arranged the banquet and were
responsible for all details of the affair.
"Gus" Vollmer, the new Marshal, who
succeeds T. Kerns, will probably be
given the powers and equipment of a
Chief of Police, the Trustees of the
town having expressed their intention
of enlarging the force, putting it on a
civil service basis and uniforming at
least a number of the deputies. Vollmer
has seen service with the American
army in the Phlllpplnes,, / but Is without
experience In a constabulary depart
ment. He has been in toe local post
office service for several wars. He said
to-day that it would be impossible for
him to announce at this time who will
be his deputies.
There are now three of these depu
tiesâW. B. Pickett, Burt Howard and
Thomas Carey. They receive a salary
of $70 a month. Deputy Howard acts
also as license collector. It Is expected
that at least five more deputies will be
appointed by the Board of Town Trus
tees after Vollmer takes office, when an
attempt will be made to rid the town
of undesirable elements and to prompt
ly punish law-breakers. #
Mayor Rickard, Trustee from the
Second Ward, is found to have won his
seat by six votes, his opponent, John
Hinkle, having made the moat strenu
ous fight of any Non-Partisan candi
date.
W. E. Knowles. a Republican School
Director, gives place to Professor E, P.
Lewis, the latter's majority being 53.
With the exception of these two men
all the Republican candidates were
elected by decisive majorities.
Town Attorney Johnson, who is as

hibited a great fondness for the infant.
The babe had been dead about a half
hour when found.

BOARD OUSTED
Two Taxpayers Petition the
Mayor to Appoint Eleven
Trustees of Institution
SAYS LAW IS VIOLATED
riaim Tenure of Office of
Incumbents Is Illegal, Un
constitutional and Void
A petition signed by M. A. O'Conor
and G. P. O'Dowd, 'for themselves and
other citizens, residents and taxpay
ers," was filed yesterday with Mayor
Schmltz requesting him to appoint
competent persons as members
oi ihe board of trustees of the pub
lic library as provided by section 1,
chapter 7, article 7 of the municipal
charter. The petition follows close
upon the suit recently brought by
O'Dowd and others to oust the present
library trustees on the alleged ground
that their tenure of office is illegal.
The suit will cause considerable delay
in the building of the new public li
brary on Hayes street should the lit
igation be long drawn out. The peti
tion to the Mayor reads:
We make this request and demand because
Ut:> axe no persons now legally holding of
fices us library trustees, as the section of
the charter under which the incumbents claim
to have been appointed Is Illegal, unconstitu
tional and void. The section violates section
1 of the fourteenth amendment of the con
stitution of the United States by depriving
taxpayers of taeir property without due pro
cess of law. It also violates section 25 of
a:tlciÂ» 80 of the constitution of this State In
that:
It la a piece of local and special legislation
regulating thÂ« election of county officers; it
releases and extinguishes the liability or obli
gation of certain persons to said municipal
corporation ; it legalizes against â  said corpora
tion the unauthorized Â«nd invalid acts of the
persona pretending to act as said board of
trustees and the provision for their election
and continuation in office is a srwclal priv
liege not conferred on such boards at all.
The persona now preluding to be said true
tata rest their claim on a theory Inconsistent
with â 11 constitutional governments by. for
and of the people, and having all the objection
able features of monarchical and oligarchical
forms of government. It is your duty as an
American citizen, sworn to support the con
stitution, to end this precedent so that it will
cot extend to other departments of the city
end 6tate covernments.
We believe It is your duty to make such
appointments forthwith, as no possible harm
can come to the city and county, no nJStter
what the final decision of the courts may be,
but great good will come from such appoint
ment and contest If the incumbents are hold-
Ing their offices Illegally and thus using and
disposing of the people's money without right
and authority of law. We will bring and pros
ecute such petitions f cr writs of quo war
â anto immediately after such appointments
and will do everything in our i-ov.er to en
'crce the constitutional and other laws ap
;>!icable thereto and beg to remind you that
*aid charter makes it your specific duty, to
see bat the laws are enforced.
Although said charter expressly provides in
section 4, chapter 1, article 4, that its of
fWrs shall be appointed by the Mayor of the
city and county or elected by the people yet
the Legislature Itself made the selection of
*aid pretending members of said board.
The Mayor is out of town, so his
on the petition could not be as
â¢ ertained.

SMILE OF AN ETHIOPIAN GARDENER
ILLUMINES A POLICE COURT.
It Conveys the Suggestion of a Ripe Water-
melon Gashed by an Explosion.
Plea of Exceptional Gentility Does Not Seem
to Influence the Bench.
BY JAMES C. CRAWFORD.
Suggestive of the bursting o-f a ripe
watermelon was Henry Brown's smile.
Parallel rows of ivory gleamed from
the crimson-fringed chasm that divided
his ebon countenance, and the humid
effect was contributed by free salivary
flow. Indeed, the frequent application
of a yellow pocket handkerchief was all
that prevented "drooling" as he stood
before Police Judge Fritz and endeav
ored to prove that his arrest for drunk
enness and vagrancy on Pacific street
was a blunder. His exhortation was lib
erally punctuated with propitiating
grins.
"De mistake ob dis yah p'leece gem-
man Ise ready teh fo-git en fogib,"
he said, nodding cheerily to Patrolman
Nelson, "fo f Ah'll kinflss dat he foun'
me in er disrepootable place. But doan
yo' get de idear intah yo' haid dat
Ah'm en ohd'neh no-good niggar,
Jedge. Ah'm de only cullud man wot
hey mixed in wif de bes' folk ob de
Unavehs'ty ob Calafohny."
"A member of the faculty, eh?"
queried his Honor.
"Well, Ah woan say ezackly dat.
Ah'm developer ob de groun", dats wot
Ah is."
"Ah, a professor of agriculture or
horticulture or viticulture?"
"No, sah; A'hm a gahdnah. Ah've
bin a-wukkin' wif spade en hoe till
Ah needs a rest, en Ah kirn ober teh de
city fo' recreshun, privious teh stahtin'
in on de spring wuk. Ah wuz visitin'

man in mah dignehfled pesishun
oughteh a bin mighty keerful about de

gib me no mo' den wot wuz kimmln'
teh me."
"I have just learned," said the bench,
musingly, "that a good hostler is need
ed at the County Jail for the next six
months. What do you know about tak
ing care of horses?"
Mr. Brown's grin abruptly sunk into
his face. "Fo de Lawd's sake, sah," he
earnestly explained, "doan trust no
hosses teh me ef yeh doan want 'em
ruinated fo' life. Ah knows nuffln
wotsumdevah erbout annermuls ob any
kine."
"Well, I'll send you out to the prison
for ten days, and you might employ
your time getting acquainted with the
duties of a hostler."
Mr. Brown's effort to appear gratified
was a miserable fiasco.
Afu-r his wife obtained a divorce and
alimony of %~ a week, John F. Machado,
barber at 313 Fifth avenue, concluded
that it would be more economical on
his part to renew marital relationship
with the woman tlian to pay her the
money, so he took up hie abode with
hÂ«-r and their two children and began
wooing. She was not easily won, how
ever, and not until he placed an en
gagement ring on her finger and prom
ised to amend his temper would she
hartcen to his pleadings. Even then
she declined to name the day until he
had undergone a period of probation,
i and well It was that she did so, for last
Sunday he suddenly became enraged
by her obduracy and chased her from
the house at pistol-point. When ar
rested he was released on bail, but
after hearing the story Judge Mogan
ordered that he be detained in custody
until to-day, when the case will be
heard.

Love of grand opera was at the bot
tom of Fred C. Eastman's arrest for
sleeping in a freight car at Fourth and
Tnwnsend streets. Stroking his Van
dyke beard and peering at Judge Fritz
through gold-rimmed glasses, he stated
that he went to hear "Laicia" sung by
the Conried warblers, leaving his wife
at home at Alameda after deluding her
Into the belief that he was called across
the bay by pressing business. When the
great performance was finished he dal
lied in various saloons, discussing Ca
ruso et al., until he was penniless and
the last ferry-boat had departed. That
was how he came to woo Morpheus In
a bÂ«x car.
' Why didn't you take your wife to
the opera?" his Honor inquired.
"Because the price of admittance was
too high to justify me in purchasing
two seats," was the answer. "Besides,
she is less cultured in music than I
am."
"And I'd wager she is also less selfish
than you are."
"You'd lose," muttered Mr. Eastman.
He was dismissed.

Qeorge F. Williams and Lucius Poole,
accused of drunkenness, were about to
be discharged by Judge Conlan when
Mr. Poole indiscreetly announced that
he and his companion were the bibu
iously inclined painters who had deco
rated the exterior of Judge Cabaniss'
residence.
"I've heard of your work," said his
Honor, "and you are fined $5 apiece."
It was Clerk "Jack" Rice who In
formed the court that the house of
Judge Cabaniss was vari-tlnted as a
peacock's tail, while Bailiff "Jack"
Laws said the domicile looked as if a
rainbow had burst and dropped upon it.
J. B. Hewlett, bootblack, and two un
named barbers donned their best

appeared, leaving the bootblack to pay
for the beverage, which he declined to
do, and was arrested for disturbing the
peace by so declining. To Judge Mo
gan, however, he expressed readiness to
pay the $2 demanded, but reserved the
right to consider the price extortionate.
James Reynolds and Harry Howard,
racetrack followers, deluded P. B.
Finch, keeper of a lodging-house at 217
Post street, into belief that they were
dishonest telegraph operators and could
furnish him with the results of races at
Emeryville several minutes before such
results were received in the poolrooms,
so that he could have a sure thing in
betting on the winner, their reward to
be 50 per cent of his gains. He ven
tured $20 on their telephoned "tip,"
and, sure enough, he won. Then they
induced him to plunge, which he did by
putting- down $500 in accordance with
their wired announcement that a cer
tain horse had just captured a certain
race. This wager he lost, after which
he had the two touters arrested for
grand larceny. Judge Cabaniss heard
Mr. Finch's testimony and continued
the case. It developed that the defend
ants were not telegraph operators at
all.

After breaking away from control of
the vaquero, a cow belonging to Sam
Aftergut, wholesale butcher at 4301 Mis
sion street, galloped into the vegetable
garden of Paul Rissoto and played
havoc. It trampled upon glass frames
sheltering tender plants and it demol
ished a great deal of "truck" that was
ripe and ready for market. Signor Ris
soto commandeered the animal and re
fused to restore it to the vaquero until
the damage it had accomplished was
paid for, so the vaquero went and in
formed his employer, who returned
with him to the scene of detention and
attempted by use of violent words and
intimidatory gesture to recover the
quadruped. 'Twas then that Signor
Rissoto drew a knife and announced hi 3
intention of carving any person who
would undertake to remove the cow
without his permission, and 'twas then
that Herr Aftergut had Signor Rissoto .
arrested and charged with having dis
turbed the peace and committed an as- j
sault with a deadly weapon. Before he
was taken into custody Signor Rissoto
placed the cow in the public pound,
where it now abides.
Judge Mogan pronounced the
chaige of assault with a deadly
weapon not well filed, inasmuch as
no actual assault was committed, and
promptly dismissed the accusation of
pern-e disturbance, on the ground that
Sig-iior Rissoto was justified in im
pounding the cow until such time as
his loss by its depredations was made
good. Then he suggested thr.t -Sis
air Pijrsoto be charged with exhibit
ing a dtadly weapon, and when Herr
Aftergut adopted the suggesyon he
v.as iiftructed to appear and state
his care to-day.
Frank Herst, diminuti%-e of frame

of 632 Tennessee street, and his rea
son for sleeping in a railway box
car night before last was that he was
afraid to go home and face the
music held in reserve for him by his
wife, a lady of vitriolic disposition.
â¢'Yesterday .* was my birthday," he

REGENTS WORRY
OVER FINANCES
Budget Will Be Considered
Another Month as There
Is Danger of a Shortage
ECONOMY IS ENFORCED
Position of Post Graduate
Medical Department to
Be Subject of Inquiry
The regents of the State University
held an unimportant session yester
day. Consideration of the budget
went over until the next monthly
meeting. President Wheeler's report
was brief and contained nothing of
particular Interest The secretary's
report was not ready.
The regents spent more than an
hour in -executive session, talking over
finances. President Wheeler said the
utmost economy was being practiced
ut the institution under his control
and that some cuts would be neces
sary if the university was going to
pass safely through the coming fis
cal year. There were several items
upon which it was thought a saving
could be made and during the month
ensuing the finance committee will
determine what pruning can be done.
It was announced that $15,000 would
be lost through the failure of the
Board of Equalization to ketfp the as
sessment roll up to the figures of last
year. A decrease has occurred de
spite the fact that the year was the
most prosperous in California's his
tory and the population had increased
10 per cent, it was pointed out.
President Wheeler reported that
the secretary ol the post grad
uate department of the medicai de
partment had reported the following
appointments: Charles G. Levinson,
professor of surgery; Thomas W.
Serviss, associate professor of rhin
ology and larynology; William F.
Friedhofer, associate professor of
gynecology; Rosamond L. Cox, asso
ciate professor of otology; Frank R.
Dray, associate professor of medicine;
Henry A. L. Ryfkogel, associate pro
fessor of surgery; George H. Evans,
associate professor of medicine;
James T. Watkins, associate profes
sor of orthopedic surgery; Charles M.
Cooper, associate professor of elec
tro-therapeutics; Florence M. Hill,
pathologist.
POLYCLIXIC QUESTION.
Appointments to the Hastings Col
lege of the Law faculty wers reported
as follows: Orrin K. McMurray and
William Denman, assistant professors
of law, and James Ballentine, instruc
tor in law.
It was announced in the report that
F. O. Seivers, a sophomore in the col
lege of mechanics, had been appoint
td a State of California scholar from
the Fourth and Fifth Congressional
districts and Miss R. E. Berber, a,
sophomore in the social sciences de
partment, a State scholar from the
Second Congressional District.
Further gifts from Mrs. William H.
Crocker of $1500 to pursue the re
search work in Mexico now being car
ried on by Mrs. Zelia Nuttall and
$1000 to buy more books on physiol
ogy were reported.
President Wheeler recommended
that the fee for pupils of the summer
school of surveying be increased from
55 to $10. as there are rtow two ses
sions and the classes are larger. The
matter was referred to the finance
committee.
When he read the names of the new
appointees of the post graduate med
ical department, also known as the
San Francisco Polyclinic, President
Wheeler suid he would recommend
that an inquiry as to what affiliation
this department had with the univer
sity be made. He said a long list of
the names of its appointees appeared
on the Senate list.
"Wouldn't this institution come un
der the same head and doesn't it bear
the same relations to the university
as the medical department?" asked
Regent Dohrmann.
'No; it is utterly different," replied
President Wheeler.
"We should not have the responsi
bility of this department without the
power that should go with it." said
Mr. Dohrmann. "I move that the ap
pointments be referred to the med
ical and dentistry colleges committee,
with instructions to make a full in
quiry."
The motion was adopted.
LEAVES OF ABSENCE.
A recommendation that rule 89 be
amended so that pupils from outside
the State who intend to make Califor
nia their permanent home shall not
be charged the fee collected of non
residents was referred to the finance
committee.
Regent Dohrmann was granted a
leave of absence for one year.
Professor E. W. Hilgard, who has*
occupied his chair at the university
for thirty-one years, was granted a
year's leave of absence with full pay.
Professor Gorrill of the law depart
ment tendered his resignation with
the statement that he wished to enter
private practice.
Dr. Joseph Flint, instructor in anat
omy, was granted a leave of absence
for two years with one-third pay un
der the agreement that he would not
be given another vacation for eight
years.
Applications for the position of
professor of music at the university,
an appropriation to establish such
a chair having been made by the last
Legislature, are stacking up on Pres
ident Wheeler's desk.

PLUMAS FOREST
RESERVE FIXED
The California Water and Forest As
sociation has received advices from
Washington that part of the land tem
porarily withdrawn for forest reserve
purposes has been permanently made
into a reserve. It is known as the Plu
mas forest reserve and was established
March 27, 1905, by proclamation of Pres
ident Roosevelt. It is chiefly in Plumas
County, with small projections also in
Butte and Tehama counties.
The acreage is 575,000, covering a por
tion of the drainage basin of the North
Fork and of the Middle Fork of the
Feather River. Most of the reserve is
mountain forest land. The timbers of
present commercial importance are su
gar pine, yellow pine and California red
fir.
Lumbering will be an important in
dustry soon after railroad transporta
tion is assured by the building of one
of the projected transcontinental roads
across the reserve. The letter of in
structions from the Secretary of Agri
culture to the forester on the transfer
of the forest reserves to the Depart
ment of Agriculture will be of interest
to every stockman and settler living in
the vicinity of this new reserve.
The general principles which will
govern the disposal of timber and wood,
the use of the water supply, the use of
the range and all other matters con
nected with the new management of
our national forest reserves are set
forth as follows:
In the management of each reserve local
aueotlons will be decided upon local grounds;
the dominant Industry will be considered first,
but with as little restriction to minor Indus
tries as may be possible ; sudden changes In
Industrial condition* will be avoided by grad
ual adjustment after due notice, and where
conflicting interests must be reconciled the
question will always be decided from the
standpoint of the greatest good of the great
est number in the long run.
At the headquarters of the forest ser
vice in Washington every preparation
1b belne made to carry out the new
management on the lines laid down
above. Stockmen who have been using
the territory covered by the Plumas re
serve for pasturing cattle, horses and
sheep will be permitted to continue
using the range during the coming sea
son. Should changes be found advis
able for the season of 1906 due notice
will be given and ample time allowed
for gradual adjustment to any ar
rangement that is found necessary for
the common good.
Equal consideration will be shown
other industries, and the people in or
near the Plumas forest reserve ran
be sure of a good beginning in proper
forest management.
On the Modoc Reserve all transient stock, or
stock which has not been regularly grazed
thereon, will first be excluded. After this Is
done bona fide residents living In the vloln
lty of the reserve will be given the privilege
of grazing the same number of etock they
had on the land previous to its i-reatlon as a.
re.sorve Then the stock belonging at a con
sicWable distance from the reserve and regu
larly graced thereon win be considered. The
number of owner* of large herds that will bÂ«
given grazing permits will be determined by
the Supervisor, to the end that this class of
owners shall not monopolise the range to thÂ«
exclusion of the stock of smaller owners or
home builders. For the season of lO^t permits
will be issued for the grazing of 3OJOOO h*ad
of cattle and horses and of 50,000 head of
sheep.

While other parts of the country are
experiencing stormy and changeable
weather, balmy skies and gentle rays
of the sun are vouchsafed to San
Francisco. Yesterday's thermometer
showed 72 degrees, which is about
comfortably warm, and, although the
prediction is a little warmer for to
day, the cool weather has not gone en
tirely.
While predicting warmer tempera
ture it is impossible to predict fairer
weather. This city has been basking
in sunshine and blue skies, while frost
is visiting the Northern States and
snow, thunderstorms and hail are
working havoc in the South. Heavy
rains are registered in the Mississippi
Valley and the region where President
Roosevelt is at present on his hunting
trip is marked for snow.

FOR GOOD GOVERNMENT.
THE people of San Francisco should not be deceived by a lull in
the open expression of graft and bad government. A temporary
subsidence in the symptoms is no evidence that the disease is
cured. In the presence of a Grand Jury that is sternly doing its duty
there is a run to cover that is an 'indication of nothing but fear of
the consequences that may be visited upon what has been done, and
of course this vacation of fear and prudence is taken only until the
storm passes and the jury expires by limitation. The system has
lost its boldness for the time being, but its evil disposition is un
abated.
In this lull and lapse of its open activities it is busy planning to
retain a hold on both parties and getting ready to win no matter
which prevails. The prize still dangles before the eyes of the push.
tor the two years' life of the government to be elected next Novem
ber there will be handled $18,000,000 of revenue for the support of
the city departments and the ordinary purposes of government, and
5i 8,000.000 more voted in bonds for public improvements. Do the
\ payers of San Francisco think that the system will be easily
Hten off with $36,000,000 in sight, as its juicy provender? Every
art of which the most astute politicians are capable will be exerted
in the seizure of the prize.
That sum of money should, in the next two years, beginning with
the new government, give to this city the best administration it has
ever had. It should make every street clean, purge the alleys, make
the slums a< sanitary as Nob Hill, enlarge the schools, make the po
lice force what it is intended to be, the protector of every man in the
iceful transaction of his business and the enjoyment of his per
ial liberty and property. It should give every taxpayer his legal
rights, and it should add to the surface adornments of San Francisco
until it is the City Beautiful.
The people want these purposes effected by the use of their
money for proper public purposes. Will they get what they want?
They can if they will. All around us. in large cities and small, there
< vidence of the awakening of the public conscience on the subject
municipal government. In some the people prevail, and in some
they aro overpowered by the "push." but everywhere they are walk
g into the open and fighting for what they want. If they do not
it now they will win next time, provided that they persist. The
â¢ i Francisco will become a byword if they remain silent
â 1 make no effort. If they make it persistently and boldly, moving
-me conscience in one purpose, and then fail, they will not only
be honored, but the experience of such a campaign will equip them
for another in which they will not fail.
It is not necessary, however, to discuss failure, for a move
ment generated by the committee of 250. supported by the Mer
chant?" Association and all of the good government clubs and im
provement associations as this will be. cannot fail in San Francisco.
The bad government club consists of those who want to break the
law. wild peddle immorality for profit and deal in filth as a com
modity, ht members lauph when preachers point out the officially
protected pitfalls which corrupt the young and rob the unwary. They
-ent the fearless administration of justice by the Grand Jury and
the courts as an unjustifiable interference with their prerogative. It
must be understood, once for all. that the system has a conscience
of its own. a perverted quality to be sure, but one by which it justi
fies its acts to itself. There is no use trying to convince a grafter
that his scheme for increasing his gain by blackmail, coercion and
duress is wrong:. His conscience is that of the daughters of the
horse leech, and cries for more. But the conscience of the daughters
of the horse leech, infesting the push, cannot survive a good sound
thra c hing at the polls.
It will be the duty of the committee of 250 to see to it that the
Republican primaries are not handed over to men who take a leave
of absence from the party to fight its ticket and then return, with
bands and processions, banquets and orations, to take charge of the
party they deserted and defeated. We want natural politics in San
Francisco, not politics by artifice and craft and graft. It is believed
that the natural majority of the Republican party in this city can
reform the administration of affairs. There is no doubt that it has
the power if it can be organized to use it. That organization is the
first work at hand. Tt is a taÂ«=k of magnitude and difficulty, and the
time from now until the August primary is none too ample for its
accomplishment.
Let the committee of 250 ramify into every precinct of the city.
Let it take time to put in each a ticket for delegates to the city
convention that is unimpeachable, composed of men who can be
trusted to know but one programme, and that requiring only that
the convention shall not be programmed, but shall be a deliberative
body, with the single duty of discarding personal ambitions and con
siderations, and making a ticket that will command the confidence of
the people, secure their favor at the polls and in office justify their
expectations. When such delegate tickets are put in the field the
ue will be joined. Let us see what sort of opposition they will
arouse. Let us see who promotes that opposition. Let us see
whether those who want to make the Republican party a nickel side
show, while the graft menagerie roars for its meat under the main
. can prevail over such a policy.
Remember it is the duty not only of every upright Republican.
but of every good citizen, to make this movement successful. The
â¢nmittee merely intends to tise the Republican organization as an
-trument of reform and a power for good government. That is all.
If the result show that such use is assured, then all who want to see
the city rise out of the gutter of municipal politics and be set upon
own hills as a light and beacon to others, should support the
movement with their ballots.
DROUGHT and its conquest is one of the questions most worthy
of consideration by the scientists of our country. Luther
Burbank, who is among the foremost of these, has accom
plished much toward that conquest by his development of a spine
less cactus, a forage plant which will flourish in such droughty
times and on soils so nearly desert as would make the existence
therein of domestic animals unprofitable or impossible. Originated
may be a right word to apply to this extraordinary work, but created
expresses more truly the magnitude of the performance, for no man
our times deserves better the title of creative genius than does
c California plant-breeder, Luther Burbank.
The spineless cactus has been produced from the prickly wild
variety which grows over vast acres of the Southwest, and remains
preen and juicy when all the grass dries up and dies in the long
nights. Cattle cannot eat it because of the thick covering of tongue-
spears with which nature protects it. Cowboys, when feed
starvation scarce, burn the prickles off the cactus so the stock can
w it. but the labor and fuel make this too costly, and it is impracti
lc to so thoroughly smooth by fire as not to sicken the cattle by
mach irritation. Burbank overcomes the difficulty by creating a
ooth-leaved cactus, and so extends man's conquest over nature,
opens what would else be de9ert to settlement and homemaking,
\a?tly increases the extent and profitableness of stock raising and,
making a providence of his human brain, humanely holds back that
hell of the Southwest, the droughtâ which brings cruel, lingering
agony when the poor beasts by tens of thousands suffer, starve and
freeze on the pitiless storm-swept plains for lack of food to keep
them warm.
The Burbank cactus is also improved by being freed of the
acridity of the wild variety. It is half as nutritious, bulk for bulk,
as alfalfa, and as it will produce much more to the acre, it equals
in value that great forage plant. It can be multiplied true to type
by planting cutting?. It will be ready as a commercial proposition
in two or three years. The effort will be made to make it growable
and profitable in all parts of fhe United States. It is probably the
SPINELESS CACTUS.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY. APRIL 12. 1905.
MUTINY AND PIRACY
AT'NT HANNAH SNOW, wife of
Captain Jabez Snow of Kenne
bunk. was almost as good a sail
or as her husband. She had gone
with him to the WÂ»st Indies on seven
voyages and had acted as mate and
second mate. She could mend a sail,
6teer her trick, make or take in sail
and use a quadrant as well as any one,
or at least as well as any mate that
ever sailed with the Hannah Snow, as
the brig was named. Captain Snow ran
between Boston and the West India
Islands, and the shippers of Boston
came to know his wife and the way
she could discipline a crew and handle
the craft.
On a certain date the brig was load
ing In Boston for a quick market. Ex
tra help was put on to get the cargo
aboard, and Captain Jabez signed a
bond to get that cargo to its destina
tion within a certain number of days,
barring hurricanes, waterspouts and
other acts of providence. The bond had
not been signed more than an hour
when he broke his leg. Nothing was
surer than that he could not carry out
his agreement, and a great financial
loss, as well as many weeks of vexa
tious delay, stared the couple in the
face. They must either find a captain
to take charge of the brig or forfeit the
charter and pay a good round sum, and
Captain Jabez was wondering if a man
could be found when his wife broke in
on him.
"Jabez. you have broke your leg, and
I don't want to be cross with you, but
you seem to forget that I am still on
earth."
"No, I don't," he replied, "but I don't
see what you can do in this case except
to git me back home and nurse me."
"Well, 1 see where I can do some
thing else, and I'm goin' to do it, too.
I'm goin' to take the Hannah to the
West Indies and back and save her
charter."
"Have you lost your senses?"
"Not a bit of it. If I couldn't make
that voyage I wouldn't be worth my
salt. I know all the crew, and I'll have
Bill Henderson for mate. We'll slip
down there and be back agin before
your leg has begun to knit. There
needn't be any more talk about finding
a captain."
When Captain Jabez thought the
matter over he was inclined to think
that his wife could do all she said,
but the consignees had to be con
sulted. When Aunt Hannah went to
them and stated the oase they did not
raise a single objection, and 1t was
settled that she was to be Captain
Hannah Snow for the voyage. It was
only after the brig had left port that
the mate's meanness came to the sur
face. He had sailed with the craft
on several voyages and was a neigh

THE MEMORY OF BIDWELL.
THE State Normal School at Chico stands upon an ample and
beautiful site donated by the late General John Bidwell. He was
for fifty years the foremost citizen of the Sacramento Valley
and one of the worthies of California. He represented the State in
Congress, and in public and private life was a model and example to
all men.
It is not necessary to share all of his views and principles to
commend him for his gentle philosophy, for his ability to reason
without invective, and to differ without asperity. When he consid
ered it necessary to make a sacrifice he made it himself and did not
force it upon another.
The town of Chico grew up by impingement upon the activities
he set in motion, and has now grown into an important center, with
an alluring future. He settled there before this territory belonged
to this country, and during a long life wrought with enterprise and
foresight for the moral and material well-being of his fellow men.
He has been dead for several years, but it is gratifying to those who
appreciate the example of an upright man that he is not forgotten.
In the Chico Normal School memorial exercises were held last
month, in which proper honors were paid to his memory. On that
occasion, after the school had rendered Mendelssohn's "Farewell to
the Forest," an address was delivered by a lady which brought out
the facjt that General Bidwell was one of the earliest promoters of for
est preservation in California. He was a naturalist and a keen ob
server, and before scientific forestry had a literature in this country
he knew the relation of the forest to climate and its function in the
conservation of moisture. All of the work done since by the Gov
ernment and by forest and water associations was mapped out by him
when men valued trees only for the lumber their columns would cut
and for the fire their limbs would make. In these days when the eco
nomic value of the forests is taught and laws are taking form for
thei preservation, it is well to cherish the memory of this pioneer
friend of the forest. It would be a proper monument to him to give
his name to one of the many national parks that are being reserved
in our mountains. He was never a citizen of any State but this. His
whole career was passed in California. A Bidwell national park ;n; n
our forests would be a dignified memorial.
CLARA TAYLOR
Captain Hannah told them to
sheer off.
bor of the Snows at home. When the
accident happened to Captain Jabez
the mate naturally hoped to get com
mand for the voyage. He would have
been distressed If any other captain
had come aboard, but to be walked
over by a woman, even though she
was the captain's wife and a neighbor,
was too much.
Aunt Hannah saw that he was in
the sulks. 'Look here, Bill Hender
son," she said, "it won't do you the
least mite of good to go on biting your
tongue over this. I can captain this
brig as well as Jabez, and I'm going
to take her out and back."
"You'll have her at the bottom be
fore we strike the Gulf Stream," he
replied.
"You never mind where I'll have
her, but 'tend to your knitting. We
are to crack on and make the best
time we can."
A day later she found the mate car
rying too little sail and an argument
ensued. Lat^r on she came on deck
from her watch below to find him

plied. "Very well, I'll let you know that
you've got the wrong pig by the ear,
I'll lose brig, cargo and everything
else in the world before I'll give in."
For a day and a night the brig made
no- progress and as the weather was
I fair she incurred no danger.
The crew saw that the woman did
i not intend to give in and it angered
j them. There was one among them
: who had read dozens of pirate books
I and always longed to sail under the
'â  black flag. Things had never come
I right for him before, but now he took
I advantage of the temper of the others
to broach the subject. He was a good
, talker and he held out such an allur-
I ing picture that even the mate, who
I was above the average man in intelli
i pence, agreed to go into the pirate
; business with the others. This deci
si on was communicated to Captan
i Hannah, who was wandering about
I unconcernedly.
"Wait, Bill, that's all right," she
1 retorted. "There's a rum and sugar
1 loaded bark comin' our way, and you
i might begin on her. "I've got a black
j shawl which I'll give you for a flag.
! and you just lay-to, board that bark
I and give 'em fits."
"I'll either turn pirate or command
j this brig," stoutly asserted the ex
mate.
"Then it is a pirate you'll become,
â  for you'll never git command here."
So a signal of distress was set on
j the brig, and when the bark came up
: and was hove to she was boarded by
I all the crew of the Snow in their own
I yawl. They might have committed
I some foolish act and had to smart
I for it but for the woman left aboard.
! Just before they reached the bark
j she hoisted her black shawl as a sig
| nal and a warning. The crew of the
stranger saiv that something was
wrong, and when the "pirates" at
tempted to board they were met with
capstan bars and belaying pins. Some
were seized and flung into the sea
after being well thumped, and when
the bark resumed her voyage and
the yawj returned to the brig with
j the discomfited "pirates" they were
i met at the gangway by Captain Han
j nah and an ancient fowling-piece
1 and told to shear off. They felt it

USE BOTH HANDS.
We should form the habit of using
each of our hands in turn In our one
handed activities, said Sir James Saw
yer in a recent lecture. In a few
months we might attain to fair ambi
dexterity, in a few years to the full use
of each hand. For this object the best
exercise is writing with the neglected
hand. If a man learned to write well
with either hand almost all the other
unimanual graces would be added unto '
him. There are many other unimanual !
activities in which, by changing the I
hand employed in them, we might cul- |
tivate ambidexterity, as by carrying a j
stick or umbrella, in fencing with a foil, |
in counting money, in changing our !
watch pocket from side to side, in j
changing the parting of our hair, in |
the use of a spoon in taking soup, in
domestic carpentry and in many other
usual activities.

READY TO BUY
DREDGE MINES
R. D. Evans, Boston's multi-million
aire, who furnished the Dulk of the
capital for developing th* vast dredg
ing properties Jn the oroville mining
district, arrived here yesterday from
the East and is registered at the St.
Francis Hotel. Evans has come to San
Francisco in connection with one of the
biggest mining deals that has ever
been undertaken in California. It con
cerns the consolidation of what is com
monly known as the W. P. Hammon
properties at Oroville and the probable
sale of them to an English syndicate,
representatives of whicn have been on
the ground for several weeks.
When W. P. Hammon first undertook
i the development of the dredging inter
j ests near Oroville he readily appre-
I ciated the value of the lands and the
; need of larjre sums of money to carry
!on the work. From Evans, who re
posed great faith in Hammon'B judg
ment, the necessary financial assist
ance was qaickly obtained, and in a
very few years there has been created
at Oroville a mining Industry that now
includes the enterprises of a dozen
companies, representing, as a whole,
the third largest interest in California,
the greater ones being the Southern
Pacific and the Santa Fe railroads sys
tems.
Recently representatives of several
big British syndicates journeyed to
California for the purpose of looking
over the dredging properties, and
within a few weeks after their arrival
it became known to a few that these
mining experts were quietly negotiating
for oDtions on not only the Hammon
properties but those of other and
smaller companies. They were working
In the Interest of different syndicates
and finaily succeeded in getting options
on the majority of the properties, but
in view of the fact that no one of
them had been able to secure a ma-
jority of the lands, negotiations were
begun between these foreign repre
sentatives with a view of settling who
should get all the options granted. Mat
ters were finally adjusted and the
work of consolidation proceeded.
According to the present plans, it
|is proposed to group the properties
and then sell them as one concern to
the Britishers. This work, it is learned
I from a reliable source, has progressed
j most satisfactorily and the ultimate
consummation of the well-planned big
deal, involving millions of dollars, is
said to be now assured.
Among the properties that are said
! to be sought by the British syndicate's
1 representatives are the Boston and Oro
ville. the El Oro and the Central, the
Butte. the Indiana, the Pennsylvania,
i the American and a number of smaller
j dredger companies* lands. Hammon
i and Evans are interested in the ma
i jorlty of these and mis fact is re
i eponsible for the present visit of Evans
to this city. He will hold a conference
j later in the week with experts who
I have been examining the lands.
It is also reported that Evans, who
I practically controls the Yuba Consoli
dated Goldfield Company's big prop
; erty on the Yuba, has received an offer
1 for this property from an English
'< source, but has been advised by John
Hays Hammond, the famous mining
engineer, not to sell. The Yuba prop
: erty ig capitalized for $12,000,000 and is
; regarded as one of the richest dredging
' properties In the world. It is believed
that the English syndicates will renew
j their offers for It and that In a few
months it will be following the other
dredger properties near Oroville into
| the control of foreign concerns.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1905.
CIVIC ACTIVITY
PEOPLE'S HOPE
i So Says Fairfax H. WTieelan
in an Address Delivered
Before the Local Y. M. C. A.
DUTY OF THE ELECTORS
| Sees Danger to the Na
tion in Growth of Great
Monster Urban Corruption
Fairfax H. Wheelan spoke last night
before the Young: Men's Christian As
sot-kition on "The Making of a City."
Many gray-haired men sat amid the
throng of younger ones and nodded
approval of Mr. Wheelffn's de
nunciation of the monster, graft,
and his declaration that the only wea
pon for the extermination of that
monster i 6 civic activity on the part
of the better class of citizens. Ap
plauee tame frequently during the' ad
dress.
Secretary McCoy of the association
introduced Mr. Wheelan as "the ter
ror of boodling and graft, whose name
was honored in every decent home in
San Francisco." and said that the fact
that he was a classmate of President
Roosevelt was enough to commend
him and his utterances to any body
of American citizens.
"One of the forces that help make
cities is this very Y. M. C. A.." said
the speaker. "No city can stand
without law and order. The reason
the Y. M. C. A. can help is that it
makes good citizens." Mr. Wheelan
spoke in part as follows:
No city is better than Its people. Some are
a good deal worse. 1 might mention one not
far away, but that would not be modest, and
we people of San Francisco are noted for our
modesty.
In a democracy. If the rulers of a city arÂ«
below the average virtue and intelligence of
the whole people, there is one cause and that
1? that the people are not alive to their civic
duty. This is a truth of the sort that all
good people should pin In their hats.
' CITIES A MODERN GROWTH.
Our cities are a modern growthâ the latest
product of clvlliiation. the triumph of genius
and the work of humanity. We can't get any
better ideas of the elevation of man than by
a comparison of the ancient and the modern
cities. In those of ancient tlm<>s the streets
were narrow, unpaved and unewept, and there
was no sewerage. Even the palaces had no
ventilation. In Berlin, in 1641â and London
and Paris were little better â there were plg
bties on the streets. If they had had a boas
in those days he would have rented out the
privilege of maintaining these sties and ob
tained a good rake-off. There was no graft
In the failure to sweep the streets, though, as
there was no cleaning fund then.
Improvements began late. In London it
wbb not till 1831 that they had an under
ground sewer. In 1855 there was not a good
pavement nor a broad, convenient sidewalk
there.
The modern city is our production and our
problem. Every age has Us problem and this
is ours. To use the street phrase. We must
"make good" or be disgraced â acknowledge
that we are unable to help in the progress of
man; we must admit that our forefathers led
us to the zenith and we could not continue
the march; that we have no genius and no ca
pacity to make life better worth the living
The importance of the problem Is increasing
every day. The population of cities is rising
and threatening ruin to free Institutions. This
increase has been the moet rapid in the last
twenty years, and if It continues at the pres
ent ratio until 1920 there will be 10.0O0.CK>)
more people In our cities than In the country.
Jefferson and other great men feared the
effect of the growth of the large cities. Were
thoae great minds right in the apprehensions'.'
You are at the danger point now. The steam
Is up to the full, and some of the worst
characters In the nation are sitting squat on
the safety valve.
Self- government is a success in the rural
districts and a failure In the cities. What are
we going to do when city politics holds dom
ination? What kind of administration will that
be for America which Is given by the power
that maintains dilapidated schoolhouses and
foeters debt, discomfort and disgrace? What
will we do when the graft king rules over all
the land?
If we are going to make America free, we.
will have to make over our cities. If you
would keep the nation worthy you must makf*
your cities worthy â make them righteous tem
ples of self-government. The children of to
day are the citliens of to-morrow. What will
you do with them in cities where there is no
proper place to rear children?
You can make the city over, but only by
making yourself over. Do your civic duty.
Enter the battle and don't stop until your city
is the proper place for you and for your chil
dren. You can make over San Francisco, re
deem her and make her a worthy Queen of the
Pacific.
Pericles said. ','Men, not walls, make a city."
Hlfl saying Is true to-day. It is always men
make cities and make nations.
The speaker compared democracies
and despotism. He said that under
the latter about all the citizen has
to do is to avoid little differences that
bring his head under the ax and let
those vested with government by di
vine right look after affairs. It is
a perfect snap for the citizen. Under
a democracy there are many disad
vantages. That form of government
is not beautifully automatic and does
not provide its own chauffeur. It
exists only through and by the active
virtues of its citizens. There is work
to do to keep it perfect.
CONSCIENCE AWAKENING.
"Government of democracy is an
institution of battle, not a state of
being." said the speaker. "Every
citizen must be a sentinel on guard."
Continuing, he said:
If such a government is to endure it must be
established on the hearthstones of the people
and written on their hearts. There are bur
dens to bear, and to refuse to assume those
burdens is like farming and depending on vol
unteer crop^ â the weeds soon choke out the
grain. There Is no substitute In a democracy
for civic duty.
Under all human progress must lie the
power of society to construct character. Neg
lect your duties, lower the national' standard
and nothing will save your nation.
Can you expect to have a "wide open" town
and a high moral standard at the same time?
There is a good deal of growling, but the
worthy person who growls puts on his smoking
jacket, dines and takes up a good book, satis
fied. Go to political meetings? No. He can't
touch elbows with those who are there; it
â¢would be vulgar. He will let the professional
politicians attend. He says we have no Inter
ests. Haven't we? I think wa have. All over
the land is awakening a political conscience.
The people will notÂ«-est upon, a despotism built
upon graft and frauds at the ballot-box. I
believe the American people are brave enough
and strong enough to preserve the nation and
throw the incompetent from office â the Inde
cent from command. They have won too many
victories to be. beaten now by crooks and
grafters. The wrath of decency is arising us
the sound of a storm In the distance.
Mr. Wheelan called upon the men
before him to help swell an army
that would make the plunderers and
thieves and grafters stand aside. The
young men of the country hold in
their hands the destiny of free gov
ernment and free democracy, he said.

WILL PLAY LEADING
PART AT COLUMBIA
IN "RED FEATHER"
TAT.KNTED VOCALIST WHO SINGS
THE LEADING ROLE IN "THE
RED FEATHER."
"Red Feather," the new De Koven-
Klein-Cook comic opera in which
Grace Van Studdiford has scored so
signally, is voted by all who have wit
nessed it durihg its long run in New
York as a superb production and a
triumph for all concerned in its stag
ing. It comes to the Columbia Theater
for two weeks, beginning next Monday
evening, with the complete cast, its
beautiful women and its splendid
choruÃ and ballet.
In the role of "the mysterious per
sonage to the country folk far and
wide," Miss Van Studdiford^ is said to
have an excellent part. Reginald de
Koven's acquaintance with Miss Van
Studdiford'ssplendidwork as the prima
donna of the Bostonians in his pre
vious operas of "Robin Hood" and
"Maid Marian" muat have served him
well while writing "The Merry Cavalier"

California Building Nears
Completeness and Will
Be Tenanted Next Month
The headquarters of the California
commission to the Portland Exposition
will be closed on Saturday next. The
commissioners are preparing to go to
Portland, to remain during the big
show. Commissioner Filcher, and pos
sibly Robert Furlong, the head of the
department of education, will go to
Portland next week. Secretary George
Dennison will remain in this city until
early in May, making headquarters
with the California State Board of
Trade, to attend to some final arrange
ments. Commissioner Wiggins has just
returned from Portland. He reports
that work is going on well at the Cali
fornia State building on the exposition
grounds and that it will be ready for
use in May.
The final work of assembling exhibits
that are needed to complete the Califor
nia display at Portland is progressing.
Commissioner Filcher says that prac
tically everything that is required has
been obtained, but everything that is
particularly good may yet be provided
with space. The large amount of mate
rial that was left over from the St.
Louis Exposition made it possible to
prepare for Portland with comparative
ease. The general plan of displaying
exhibit* and of allotting space has
caused more discussion than anything
else. Commissioner Wiggins will re
main In Los Angeles for a short time
attending to matters relating to the
Southern California part of the show.

STANFORD UNIVERSITY. April 11.
It has finally been determined that
the intercollegiate boat race between
Stanford and the University of Wash
ington will ' be : rowed on the bay at
Sausalito on Friday afternoon. April
14 The northern crew arrived in San
Francisco this morning and after Man
ager Barrett and Coach Knight "of
Seattle had conversed for a few min
utes over the telephone, they speedily
agreed that the oarsmen should meet
at Luamlfto. The Stanford crew will
l*-n.ve the campus on the morning of the
contest, .taking their four-oared shell
on the train.
The Washington crew will attempt
the herculean deed of rowing two inter
cullegiate races In two consecutive
days. On Saturday, less than twenty
four hours after the struggle with
Stanford, the men from Seattle will
start against the University of Cali
fornia on the Oakland estuary. For
a crew to do this, especially after a
thousand mile journey on the cars, Is
a feat that has been tried by few col
lege men, for rowing: Is the most ex
haustive sport of modern day*. Coach
Knight expressed tbe opinion that his
men would all be able to stand the
test and he is confident of winning both
races. Even if the visiting collegians
do not win here, after their trip, they
feÂ«=-l sure of a victory at the return re
gatta on Lake Washington.

Mike Fisher steered his bunch of
Tigers to the Eighth-street lot yester
day afternoon and before they got
through with Uncle's tribe the latter
looked like â  rank bush league lay
out. The slaughter that came off in
the sixth spasm was awful. It did
not er till the Tigers had enticed
three runs through and then all was
over. Score â San Francisco, 1; Ta
luraa, 6.
The Seals managed to crowd all
their bad baseball into that one round,
while the Tigers were there with the
best they had during the same period,
fee the result can be imagined by any
fan who was not on the spot. The
fiix tallies were the result of five hits,
though a couple of misplays and a
very close decision which went against
the native team helped some.
Doyle opened up the pot of trouble
in that fatal sixth when he copped
oft a dinkey hit. Bill Thomas bunted
to Nealon and Flash winged the ball
many feet wide to second. Then Nor
dyke swung through with a hit and so
did Eagan, Casey and McLaughlin.
When the Tigers got that first run
over they were desperate and crazy
for more, so they did not hesitate till
they had completed a good job.
The whole San Francisco team
seemed to follow young Henley in his
excursion into the heavens when the
big- rally was coming off. Up to that
time Henley was pitching a nice game
of ball and he seemed to have the In
dian sign over the head of each Tiger.
But the rally was too many for him
and he was nol there when it hap
pened.
The Seals did not send a man
through till the eighth spasm, when
a couple of bingles and a long fly put
Spencer past the wire. Fitzgerald had
everything when men were on bases.
Many times the Seals could have
broke in with runs, but the little old
hit was never forthcoming when need
ed most.
Umpire Gus Klopf bowed his first
bow to the fans. He did not make
good yesterday, though he hardly had
an even break, as he was hit on the
side of the face with a thrown ball
before the game and badly hurt. He
got into a mix-up with Tommy Shee
han when the battle was but a few
moments old, so the little fellow was
foned to take to the bench and come
through with a five-spot.
Uncle announced yesterday that he
would give Ferguson, the St. Mary's
College pitcher, a chance to shine to
morrow afternoon. Ferguson made a
great record in the bush league as
well as in college and those who know
say he will make good. The score:

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12, 1905
OAKLAND, April 11. â McCreedie's
Mammoths from the Willamette were
subdued by Captain Rip Van Haltren
and his Pigmies in a sensational strug
gle in the Idora Park diamond this
afternoon. The game was won by the
Oaklanders in the last half of the ninth
act when the White Stocking Giants
had downed two men. Score 6to 5. It
was a bustle raising finish and one
that was frantically relished by the
loyal fans who feasted their lamps
upon the game.
Iberg floated up his dilatory teasers
to the big fellows from Portland and
the best they could do was to harvest
five singles and a three bagger from
his offerings. Ham astounded himself
and al! present in the fifth spasm by
slamming his stick against the sphere
for three bags. He was unable to ex
plain how he accomplished the feat and
vouchsafed no apology.
Buck Francks was the hero of the
pinch occasion and it was his drive to
left center in the final inning that
made it easy for Graham and Van
Haltren to prance to the plate with
the tallies that saved the day. An
ciont Rip Van Haltren signalized his
return to the game after taking a
week's rest for an Osier complaint by
lambasting the leather in the opening
round for three corners. He passed
in on Kruger's out, Atz to Clark. Jimmy
Byrnes, who was also in the sick ward
last week, mauled the horsehide globe.
In the second he connected for a brace
of bags, was sacrificed to third by
Iberg and registered on Schlafiey's slow
handling of Van Haltren's infield biff.
Iberg scored in the fifth on his swipe
for three sacks and a sacrifice by
Kruger. With two men benched in the
ninth Captain Van Haltren ordered
Graham to wield the bat for Iberg.
OEcar started an easy one toward Run
kle, who fondled the pellet until It
was too late to capture Graham at
first. Vtteran Van then propelled one
along the ground half way between
first and second, which Clark headed
off. but was unable to "et back to
the bag with it before Old Rip slid
in. Then came Buck Francks and the
globe was pounded out to left center.
Graham and Van Haltren scoring and
terminating the frenzy.
Portland secured its first run in the
third frame. Van Buren soaked safely,
purloined the keystone sack and saun
tered home on Jurist McCreedie's
three base swat. In the eighth Clark
hit by third. French bunted and Iberg
picked up the sphere, turned and slam
med it to second. There was no one
there to greet the ball and it went to
center, Clark scoring. Van Buren
was presented with a walk and was
forced by McCreedie's poke to Kelly.
I^arry Schalfley then laced one across
â¦he third sack, sending in French and
McCreedie.
King played left to-day in place of
Dunleavy, who was indisposed. Score: j

NOVEL TOURNEY
COMES TO END
Gardner, Rolfe and Schmidt
Carry Off Tennis Honors
in the Indoor Matches
BIG CROWD TURNS OUT
Singles Set Proves to Be
an Exciting Event, but
Doubles Is One - Sided
Many interested spectators witness
ed the final match of the indoor tennis
tournament played at the Forest, Fish
and Game show last night. Carl
Gardner of the California Club carried
off the honors in singles, while Her
bertSchmidt and Harry Rolfe of the
same club won the doubles.
Of the two matches, the singles was
the closest and most Interesting. Gar
dners reach was too much for George
Janes, his opponent. The latter found
it almost impossible to pass the length}'
expert. Gardner won in straight sets,
boih of which were exceedingly close.
The score was 6-4, 9-7. The semi-final
match played on the California Club
courts in the afternoon resulted in a
victory for Gardner. He beat Rolfe
6-1, 6-3.
In doubles, Schmidt and Rolfe proved
much too strong for Charles Foley
and Charles Dunlap. The former were
more accustomed to the court and
iignts and led at all tines. j.ne score
In their favor was 6-3, 6-4.
The exhibition doubles match which
was originally set for Thursday night
will be played to-night at 8:30. Tho
contestants will be Dr. Summer Hardy
and Dr. McChesney and Percy Mur
dock and Grant Smith. Samuel Hardy
will be unable to play and his place
will be taken by McChesney. None of
the four experts have had any prac
tice in the indoor court, but as they
alj know the game well they will un
doubtedly furnish an interesting match.
This match will conclude the indoor
tennis.
KNIGHTS AND LADIES
OF HONOR IN SESSION
Motion to Hold Biennial Meetings
Discussed â Election of Grand
Officers To-Day.
The Grand Lodge of the Knights and
Ladies of Honor met yesterday in an
nual session in the Foresters' building,
24 Eddy street, with Mrs. Frances J.
Williams, grand protector, in the chair
and- the following named grand officers
present: L. G. Wolfe, past protector;
D. J. Gairaud, vice protector; H. W.
Quitzow, secretary; A. Gompertz, treas
urer; Jennie Nussbaum, chaplain; Jen
nie Dinklage, guide; Marion G. Perry,
guardian; W. E. Banbrock, sentinel; E.
H. Bourguignon, A. H. Anderson and
Ellen Fitzgerald, trustees; James P.
Dockery, supreme representative, and
Z. T. Whitten, supreme alternative.
After conferring the Grand Lodge de
gree on a number of past protectors,
the grand protector appointed James P.
Dockery, S. Hyams and "Louise Bigler
the committee on distribution.
The reports of the grand officers, as
well as those of the district deputies to
the grand protector, were presented and
referred to the committee on distribu
tion.
The report of the grand protector
shows that during her termÂ» in spite of '
a serious illness which confined her to
her home for some weeks, she visited
officially all the lodges in the city and
seven in the interior, encouraging the
members of each. In Healdsburg a
lodge was reorganized. She deplores
the fact that for want of funds the
work of propagation could not be car
ried on with that degree of activity she
had planned. In her report she recom
mends that there be biennial instead of
annual sessions on the ground of econ-4
omy, and on the further ground that a
portion of the money paid for mileage
and expenses of a Grand Lodge could
be used for propagation work. She
suggests the giving of public entertain
ments and more visits to the subor
dinate lodges by the grand officers.
Grand Secretary Quitzow's report is
in the main a tabulated one, relative
to the membership and financial condi
tion of each lodge in the State. Dur
ing the year the order had forty-seven
initiations and a loss of five by death.
The finances at the close of the year
were in good condition.
J. A. Colquhoun of Oakland was ap
pointed Journal clerk.
In accordance with the suggestion of
the grand protector an amendment to
the constitution making Grand Lodge
sessions biennial instead of annual was
presented and referred to the commit
tee on laws.
J. A. Colquhoun of Oakland. Anna
Brigham of Healdsburg and J. J. Hicks
of San Francisco, past protectors, were
recommended for the honor of having
the rank of past grand protector con
ferred on them in recognition of ser
vices rendered to the order in the past.
The per capita tax was. fixed at
$51 50 per year, payable semi-annually,
and the salary of the secretary and
the contingent fund of the grand pro
tector was allowed to remain as last
year.
The matter of biennial sessions was
discussed at length, with a strong sen
timent against, but to allow the other
side an opportunity to speak on the
t matter further argument was post
poned until this morning after the elec
tion of grand officers.
Grand Protector Mrs. Williams, who
had been urged to continue in office
for another year, stated that sha. could
not, on account of her health, accept
another term.
In the evening Bay City Lodge ex
emplified the ritualistic work of the
order by initiating ten candidates be
fore the officers of and representatives
to the Grand Lodge. There was a
large attendance.
THREE THOUSAND CHILDREN
REHEARSE FOR FESTIVAIi
There was a great rehearsal of 3000
school children yesterday in the Al
hambra for the forthcoming May
Festival. Miss Estelle Carpenter di
rected the choruses, which were fault
lessly and beautifully rendered. The
numbers were "The Hills of Califor
nia," words by Will Carleton; "Three
Chafers," "Praise Ye the Father,"
"The Star-Spangled Banner" and "Old
Folks at Home."
One of the features of the rehear
sal was the appearance of the ~ drum
and bugle corps of Hancock Gram
mar School. The pupils arrived in a
special car under direction of Princi
pal Armstrong.
School Directors Roncovieri, Boyle
and Altman were present at the re
hoarsal and expressed their satisfac
tion with the result.
There will be rehearsals at 10
o'clock this morning, to-morrow and
Friday morning,
AMERICANO IS SECOND
TO FLYING HONITON.
Kermit, at Long
Odds, Reaches
Wire First.
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
It seemed like old times once more
when Americano, sporting the black
with red maltese cross of "Lucky"
Baldwin, finished second to Honiton
in the five and a half furlong handi
cap at Oakland yesterday. America
no, carrying 104 pounds and piloted
by a diminutive lad named Willie Kel
ly, went to the post at odds of 16 to
1, wfiile "Packy" Ryan's mare ruled
a 9 to 20 choice. The outsider came
with a rush approaching the wire and
Knapp rode the favorite out, passing
the Judges half a length in the lead.
The faint-hearted Glendenning lost
the show to Sad Sam by a narrow
margin.
Surprises were furnished by Gal
lant Cassie and Kermit, while three
public choices carried brackets. The
attendance was large.
So great was the scramble to get
aboard Charley Patterson's Syphon
Girl in the betting on the two-year-old
event that the odds about Southern
Lady lengthened from 3 to 4 to 1.
Larsen, astride Syphon Girl, failed to
escape a jam which occurred soon
after the start and his mount ran un
placed. Little Graham got away well
with Southern Lady, rated her ex
tremely well and' beat Lady King a
neck at the wire. I'm Joe, after meet
ing with some ill luck, finished a
bang-up third.
F. E. Shaw, from the stable of Bian
chi & McGovern, made a cathop of the
Futurity course run for non-winners of
more than one race in 1904-5. Ridden
by Larsen and an 11 to 10 favorite, the
chestnut horse galloped in before Pa
chuca and Billy Taylor, two outsiders.
Laura F M and Sacredus, the second
and third choices, respectively, encoun
tered stormy weather.
Gallant Cassie, from the Miller nov
elty stable, furnished some catchy en
tertainment at popular prices in the
six-furlong selling sketch. Cassie's odds
were swiped by the layers from 8 to 6,
caused by a well-directed enfilading
fire. Wiley rode the good thing and,
of course, soon showed in front. At the
paddock it looked as if Larsen on Tou
pee, the 13 to 10 favorite, had the out
sider up his sleeve, but it proved an op
tical delusion. Gallant Cassie reached
the wire a head to the good. After a
wonderful trip through Fairyland and
the Black Alps, Graham anchored on
third base with Sun Rose.
Kermit, a 20 to 1 chance, played down
to 12, took the mile and a furlong sell
ing affair from a field ot cheap
ones. The outsider had "Handriding"
Kelly In the saddle, and after cutting
out the pace from the start won ridden
out from Allopath and Hermencla,
Bob Smith's Telephone closed favorite
for the final mile purse run, and was
returned a handy winner. Mildred
Schultz led for three-quarters of a mile,
where Larsen slipped through on the
rail with the favorite. Clark on Forest
King came with a wet sail when it was
too late, falling short just half a length.
Ralph Young ran third.
TRACK NOTES.
Harry Larsen carried off the sad
dle honors with two winners.
Trainer Tom Cook of the Baldwin
stable thinks W. Kelly a coming star.
The little fellow rode at 70 pounds.
Sad Sam is becoming a most ac
commodating sprinter, stopping both
at the crossings and in the center of
the blocks.
The judges gave Wright two weeks
on the ground for rough riding tac
tics displayed In the two-year-old
event.
Frank Skinner is no longer an own
er. He disposed of Bombardier, Ho
ratius and an interest in a couple of
other horses to Tobe Ramsey yester
day.

Vote of Two to One Favors
Joining of Cumberland
and Presbyterian Bodies
A STALWART OPPOSITION
â . â  Â«
President J. 8. Macintosh
Gives Glowing Account
of Results at Seminary
â¢
The Presbytery of San Francisco held
its spring meeting yesterday at Calvary
Presbyterian Church, the Rev. J. H.
Laughlin, moderator, in the chair. The
Rev. H. N. Bevier, stated clerk, was'
elected treasurer.
One of the matters of importance was
the adoption 6f a resolution favoring
the union of the Cumberland Presbyte
rian and the Presbyterian churches.
Dr. John S. Macintosh, president of the
San/ Francisco Theological Seminary,
read the overture embodying the prop
osition. The doctor, however, opposed
the union, as did the ' Rev. Mr. Bevier.
President Macintosh in voicing his op
position to the amalgamation pointed
out that he did not wish it understood
that he was in any way standing as an
obstacle in the matter or that he was in
opposition with the brethren, with
whom he was in ecclesiastical and per
sonal sympathy. The aspect of the case
made it impossible for him to assent to
the union. He considered that the Cum
berland church as a church was more
largely . against than . for union, and
that there would be serious financial
difficulties should a union be effected.
The colored brethren were involved in
the outcome. They were almost unan
imously opposed to union, feeling that
in such an event they would be placed
in an invidious position. President
Macintosh considered the movement
premature and misleading.
In supporting the stand taken by
President Macintosh, Mr. Bevier de
clared that church union was a futile
dream, for there was a differentiation
in Christian minds. The glory of pro
testantism, he said", was its' freedom of i
thought.
FAVORS UNITY OF CHURCHES.
1 The Rev. W. J. Fisher, pastor of
Cumberland Presbyterian Church, was
accorded a hearty welcome, and he
took up his position for union. The two
churches, he said, stood for the same
doctrines, and he could not 'â  see why,
with identically the same doctrine and
preaching the same Gospel, they should
not be united.
The Rev. Mr. Guthrie, the Rev. Mr.
Bercovitz and the Rev. Mr. McElhinney
Joined in th* discussion, which termin
ated in the session voting for union of
the two bodies. The vote was two to
one in favor.
Committees appointed were: Bills ,
and overturesâ Dr". John S. Macintosh, j
Rev. T. M. Boyd and Elder A. H. Mac- j
Donald; narrativeâ Rev. E. K. Strong,
Rev. Richmond Logan and Elder O. H.
Wilkins; judicial, Dr. John Hemphill
and Rev. Moses Bercovitz; treasurer's
account. Elders Balrtaves and White.
The Rev. Mr. Durand. in reporting
on "'work among foreigners, made the
statement that there are a large num
ber ,of Italians, and French who do not
attend any church and who are quite
indifferent to any religion.
It: was resolved- to continue the
Hebrew Mission 1 under the pastorate of
the Rev. Moses "Bercovitz, with an ad
visory committee . .consisting of Dr.
Sturge, the Rev. F. A. Doane and Wil- :
liam Balnaves. The sum of $600 was
continued .foe the support of* . the
mission. .
SUNDAY SCHOOL INCREASE. 4 |
The matter of removing Franklin- i
street Church" to a more suitable neigh- j
borhood was considered and left to a i
committee. '. '.â â '. â¢â¢ â 
A committee consisting- of the ' Rev.
Mr. Bevier and the Rqv. Herbert. E. j
Hayes ' was appointed to make a re- j
port on the French church, i It was
said that the members nad scattered, j
and the proposition to disband the '.;
church will be considered later. â¢ j
The ; ev, Richmond Logan reported!
that Jhe Sunday-schools showed an' in- !
crease of 601.' Rev. Mr. Guthrie reported ;
that the Young' People's Society's total j
membership was 714 and gifts amount- I
â¢â <! to $1694. \
On the. motion of President Macintosh |
it was resolved that the presbytery
meet in January, March; May, Septem
ber and November.
'. It ; was resolved to call a special meet
ing of the presbytery at the First
church May 1 for the purpose of in
corporating the presbytery ,, of San
Francisco according to the laws of the
State, of .California.
President Macintosh gave a glowing

of "white"', Carrara marble which she
had 'made for r her in' Italy with the
intention of. donating them to St.

Will Be Released To-Day.
The damage by fire to the tramp - steamer
Adato. which arrived Monday night from the
Orient, was confined to the cabin and pantry,
and repairs will not - cost more than $1000.
The- vessel was anchored all yesterday off. the
quarantine station, discharging ; her ballast.
She will be released this morning- ! and ' proceed
to Oakland, where nearly a full cargo of cot
ton and machinery is ''awaiting her. She is
here under charter to thÂ« occidental and Ori
ental Steamship Company, and Captain Wilson
will superintend -the, loading. â '- After taking
into her hold : the freight at Oakland she will
come to this side of the bay and finish loading
at the Santa Fe wharf. John Woods.- shop
foreman nt the Rlsdon Iron Works, visited the
Adato yesterday. As he wag leaving-, the quar
antine steamer General Steinberg appeared on
the scene and Woods and his launch, Risdon
No. 2, were seized by the Federal doctors and
taken to Angel Island. Visiting a vessel while
the yellow flag, Is still -flying. is an offense the
Federal authorities cannot overlook, and before
Woods leaves Angel Island he will be fully im
pressed with the importance of a regulation
marie by -Uncle â¢ Bam. Offenders against > this
law. if . aught, rarely repeat the offense, and
usually are mute Â«is to what happened to them
at Angel . Island. â . Fumlgatron in the hands- of
an expert can be made exceedingly unpleasant
for the fumigatee,' and under . Dr. â  Gumming
on Angel Island are some past masters in the
art. A boatman : who was given the "third de
gree at the quarantine station some weeks ago
was heard to remark the other day: "Skunks
isn't nothing.". -'â . . 'â _' ' "â â  ;â

Baby. Xorther Sweeps Harbor.
A baby norther swept the , harbor yesterday
morning, and, although none of the larger ves
sels suffered any damage, the Infant gale shook
up , some of the craft In "its .own f class pretty .
severely. Along- the bay shore, from the seawall
to the- Presidio, many scow schooners'rendez
vous. â¢ Among these the miniature gale dirt some
effective.. blustering'.- The scow schooner 'Dora:
was rubbed against the seawall â¢ until her rail
and bulwarks on one side had been reduced to
firewood. The tug Sea Witen pulled away and
towed her to shelter. ..A graver scow, loading
at : the' foot of Webster street, .was driven
ashore, and all the pulling of two stack
tugs failed to drag her Into 'deep water. The
scow schooner Lizzie Theresa also got a ; few
rap?, but none of the damage -was serious, and
early In the "afternoon the bay from Hunters .
Point to the heads was : like a shining mill

A Chinese named Hucn Wongr was
committed to the State Hospital for
the Insane at Stockton yesterday. It
developed that he had been a pupil hi
Butte, Mont., of a white woman
teacher at a Chinese school and that
he had become insanely infatuated
with her. Hte infatuation unbalanced
his mind and his countrymen shipped
him under guard to this citv, where
his mania became dangerous to him
self and others.

Codlin Moth Parasite That
Will Save Apples Comes
to Maturity in Orchards
- 1.1 'â¢* "~Â» â
SUCCESS ; NOW ASSURED
â  Hi-
Facts of Large Importance
Are Reported- ' to Board
of County t Supervisors
Â» . Â.
The Horticultural Commissioner of
California has received a copy of a re
port just submitted by the Sonoma
County Board of Horticultural Commis
sioners to the Sonoma Supervisors, in
which the success of the parasite that
destroys the codlin moth is announced.
Three colonies of the parasite were
sent from the offices of the Horticul
tural Commission in this city to So
noma County. They were liberated at
Stony Point in continuous orchards of
more than 200 acres on the 2d day of
February. â¢
On March 30 the field officer of the
Sonoma County Horticultural Commis
sioners found an adult pupa under a
band In the Cadwell orchard. Word
was sent to this city, and State in
spector Caroes, with a field officer,
made an inspection. They found many
parasites in all stages of development
and tn maturity. The discovery of
young larvae showed that not only had
the original colony been active, but that
the next generation was at work.
The first adult to appear in the breed
ing cages was seen March 10. Since
that time eight colonies of the benefi
cial parasite have been liberated in So
noma CouTity. Two hundred and fifty
insects are known to have been
hatched. These have been distributed
as far as possible in such way as to
include every portion of the county in
the area served.

AGED MRS. GAGE H. ' MOXEY If
: : ;, DOESN'T WANT GUARDIAN
Bride of Hoover's Fencinc Master
Seeks Restoration to Mental
Competency.
Aged Mrs. Gage H. Moxey, who was
declared incompetent by Judge Coffey
on March 19, 1903, has filed an action
to be restored to competency. She la
represented in this latest action by
Attorney Edgar C. Chapman. Her
husband Is young Oliver N. Moxey, a
fencing master.
It is certain that Mrs. Moxey will
, be -opposed in her action to be df
clared again mentally competent by
her daughter and her son-in-law,
Harry L. Mandeville, who was ap
pointed Mrs. Moxey's guardian by the
court after it had been proved tc the
satisfaction of Judge Coffey that
Moxey thought as much if not more
of her wealth than he did of her. It
was proved that prior to her marriage
to Moxey he had formed well defined
plans to become possessed of all her
wealth and was succeeding very well
| when Mrs. Mandeville and her hns
band entered protest and won their
suit. An appeal was taken by Moxey,
but this has not been pressed as a
compromise wag entered into by which
the appellant was allowed to retain
a portion of the realty holdings that
had come to him through his suc
cessful courtship of his aged bride.
Mrs. Moxey's latest suit has also
been assigned to Judge Coffey . for
hearing and it is quite probable that
the story of how Mrs. Moxey fell a
victim to Cupid's shaft in the Hoover
I Institution will have to be gone over
I again from start to finish.

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. April â A nervous and ap-
I prehensive tone was reflected In the move
ments of stocks throughout to-da\ Â» session.
I The grounds for the suspicions of the market
I harbored in the speculative mind were not
manifest from any event in the public knowl
edge, but their Influence upon the trading
was nevertheless effective. Professional opera
tors claimed to detect evidences of "good sell
j tug," meaning by that selling by inside in
; terests In different properties. There is no
I certain - means of detecting selling of this
: dam, but the beller that it v.as going ob
! was evidence -of the nervous state of the
I speculative mind. Actual events were in favor
Jof values. The Government report of the
; April 1 condition of the winter wheat crop
j was a notable instance.. Crop prospects have
' been looked forward to with great hopes as
I a stimulating factor In the speculation to take
â  the place of the much-used merger and divi
dend Increase stories, which have begun to
! chow signs of having outlived their effective
! ness. But the crop promise at this early
i period and -with the uncertainty of the grow
ing season to be fared proved unavailing to
j hold the market. The holding of a meeting
< of the Northern Securities directors was an
' other source of uncertainty. The results of
j the meeting proved to be enigmatical to -the
1 general surmises in the stock market. The
uncertain tone of the market was indicated by
its constant fluctuations, the course of prices
i changing at least once during every hour of
1 the session. The opening was decidedly strong
; and there was another comprehensive rally
after the first decline. Later In the day
j there were Individual points of strength. Illi
. nois Central was the conspicuous feature ot
' the day and It seemed to meet with little
\ opposition in its swift advance. There wan
1 a disposition to give the day's favor to this
j stock a* the chosen property designed for
j absorption on account of the Union j Pacific
preferred stock issue, but the supposition was
a- lacking in authority as the various otherh
on the same subject which have -been set
i afloat from time to time. The uncertain ter
n, per held throughout and the closing Itself
was irregular, but with the day's extremes
much reduced.
I ; Bonds were irregular. -Total sajea,. par value
' $2,755,000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
call.

and the fair " local consumptive demand kept
the market steady. ' and thera was little dis

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
Receipts of Strawberries were Increased to
90 chests, and after some early firmness the
market weakened and prices declined sharply.
Highly colored berries sold off well at or near
the top quotations, but green 'stock, which
formed a large percentage of the receipts, was
slow of sale at Irregular prices. The Orange
market was firm and closely cleaned up on
small sizes, which were still favored by buy
era while large fruit waa. In ample supply and
comparatively weak. Six carload* were an
nounced for to-day's auction. Choice Tan
gerines were scarce and firm, at good price*.
while ordinary offerings were plentiful and
rather dull at the inside quotation. The other
Citrus fruits were quiet but steady. Apples
and Bananas were in ample supply and met
with a fair demand at unchanged quotations.

SILENCE MARKS AUTHOR'S
VISIT TO SAN FRANCISCO
Henry James Is Here
Enjoying Balmy
Climate.
Returns to His Native
Land in Search of
Pleasure.
Henry James, the well-known author,
who. although an American by birth,
has found the more conventional eli
vironmerits *of English society more
conducive to his personal comforts and
has consequently made his residence in
London for nearly thirty years, arrived
here yesterday and is staying at the
St. Dunstan.
James is making a tour of the United
States, where, in the early 70s, he was
wont to contribute interesting literature
popular magazines. He has been
ir.sr several weeks in Southern
Â» aiifornia and has come north simply
-> pursuit of pleasure.
Among Western people, whom he has
often portrayed with his pen in a man
ner that would readily suggest his
familiarity with their peculiar customs
and manners. James is well remem
bered as tht author of the "Trans-
Atlar.tic Sketches,' "Tlie Americans"
and "The Europeans," products of his
fertile mind that were developed after
he had gone abroad. In later years he
has given the reading public many in
teresting stones, among his latest being
â¢The Awkward Age." "A Little Tour
of France" and "The Sacred Font."
Since his arrival in this country Mr.
James hat avoided interviewers as far
as it was within the range <jf possibil
ity, but on several occasions he has run
foui oCthe newspaper reporters and in
advertently volunteered criticism of
Americans, including President Roose
velt, that have not l>een pleasing read
ing matter to his countrymen. That he
has appreciated the fact that his criti
cisms were a bit boa strong for the ap
petite of at least the Westerners was
suggested yesterday, when, shortly
after his arrival from the south, he gave
strict orders to the management of the
St. Dunstan that he was not to be dis
turbed by newspaper representatives,
and the clerk of that exclusive estab
lishment refused to send cards to the
author's rooms, explaining that Mr.
James had announced that he "was not
receiving to-day."
It is proposed, however, that James
t-hali have one opportunity to talk dur
ing hip short stay in San Francisco,
and that will be on the occasion of a
dinner to be given to-morrow night at
the Bohemian Club to Charles Warren
Ptoddard. at which the former will be
a welcomed guest.
Londoners Wonder at Tins.
LONDON. March 29. â Literary
folks here are wondering how it hap
pens that a letter written by Charles
Dickens to Henry James is now being
offered for sale by a London an
tique dealer. In the tradesman's cat
alogue which has been sent to most
collector*, this epistle is described as
utograph letter, signed, written
by Mr. Charles Dickens to Mr. Henry
J?mes in lhf~ " and the price quoted
for the document is Â£2 IBs, or about
IIS 75. ThP dealer does not tell by
â¢whai means the letter reached him,
and it would be interesting to know
how to pass out of Mr.
James' possession.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY. APRIL 12, 1905.
SMITH MURDER
TRIAL BEGINS
The trial of Joseph Smith, the aged
contractor, charged with the murder of
Joseph E. McGowan at the terra cotta
works, 2969 Mission street, on the morn
ing of November 26, was begun before
a jury in Judge Lawlor's court yester
day. The witnesses examined were
Corporal George W. Russell of the Po
lice Department, who- explained a dia
gram he had made of the scene of the
murder; Dr. L. D. Bacigalupi, autopsy
surgeon, and James Beatty, an eye
witness of the murder.
During Beatty's examination almost
every question was objected to by At
torney Henry Ach. counsel for the de
fendant, which led to interminable
bickerings between opposing counsel
and the bench. Ach moved a chair
within the railing, and after a few min
utos Assistant District Attorney Ferral
insisted that Ach should move to his
proper place at the lawyers' table and
not intimidate the witness. Ach retorted
that he was not intimidating the wit
ness, but claimed that he could not dis
tinctly make out what the witness said.
He insisted that each answer of the
witness should be read to him by the
court reporter. The Judge told Ach
not to be captious. He had to move to
the lawyers' table, and every answer
of the witness was repeated to him by
the court reporter.
Beatty testified as to the quarreling
between the defendant and McGowan
about a dog and to McGowan knocking
the defendant down. Beatty and Mc-
Gowan went into the mixing shed to
consult about some work, and when
coming out they were confronted by the
defendant, who had a double-barreled
shotgun aimed at them. Beatty tried
to catch hold of the barrel, but missed
it and fell. Just then he heard the shot
and McGowan fell beside him with
blood spurting from his head. The de
fendant walked down the yard, calling
McGowan all the offensive names he
could think of, and said, "McGowan
was nothing but a Democrat, and a
Democrat was no good unless he was
dead."
The trial will be resumed this morn
ing.
TIMBER LAND FRAUDS
BEFORE FEDERAL COURT
W. H. Boren on Trial for Subornation
of Perjury in Connection With
Applications for Entries.
W. H. Boren, formerly of Oregon
and recently of Shasta County, was
placed on trial before S. jury yester
day in the United States District
Court. Boren was indicted by the
Federal Grand Jury with Harry W.
Miller and Frank E. Kincart for sub
ornation of perjury in connection
-with timber land entries in Shasta
County. Miller was also indicted by
the Federal Grand Jury of Oregon
and wa3 taken to Portland for trial.
At the trial yesterday United States
District Attorney Robert T. Devlin
and Assistant United States At
torney Charles M. Fickert ap
peared on behalf of the Gov
ernment. The prisoner was de
fended by J. H. Creighton and Frank
V. Cornish of this city, John M. Lay
ton, John G. Martin, Jesse Stump and
Mrs. Emma Martin testified that Bo
ren had induced them to swear to ap
plications for timber lands that they
had never seen and that he had col
lected fees from them. They testi
fied also that within an hour or so
after having filed on the lands Boren
induced them to transfer the property
to the Washington Milling Company,
of which he said he was an agent.
Boren took the stand and denied
these allegations. He said on cross
examination by Mr. Devlin that his
occupation was that of a timber crui
ser and that he had recently arrived
from Orgeon, where he had been
cruising for timber claims. The case
will be given to the jury to-day.
UNCOVER MILLIONS
THEY SEEK TO WIN
Dunsmuir Heirs Victorious
Defeat Scheme to Take Securities Away
Another remarkable chapter has been
written in the contest over the will of
the late Alexander Dunsmuir, involving
the defeat of a hurried effort to remove
beyond the jurisdiction of the courts of
! California securities belonging, it is
said, to the estate of the deceased es
timated to be worth from $2,000,000 to
$6,000,000. Judge Co-ffey made the order
that will hold these securities here.
The order was not made, however, un
til after Attorney Charles S. Wheeler,
representing James Dunsmuir, former
Premier of Canada and brother and
sole devisee of the iate Alexander
Dunsmuir, had made a desperate bat
tle for an opposing ruling, an analysis
of his argument making it plain that
\ technically it stands as a repudiation
of all proceedings heretofore taken un
behalf of James Dunsmuir and a re
pudiation of his oaths as executor of
the will of the dead capitalist.
Judge Coffey's order ut yesterday was
, directed to the Pacific Improvement
I Company, Horace G. Platt as one of its
officers, the Canadian Bank of Com
merce and all others that may hold
: property of the deceased to keep them
within the jurisdiction of the court and
place them in the hands of Public Ad
ministrator Hynes for disposition as
the law may direct. The order was the
result of precipitate action on the part
of Attorney Thomas W. Hickey, repre
senting the Public Administrator, who
rushed into Judge Coffey's court yes
terday morning with an affidavit set
ting forth that at the direction of
James Dunsmuir stock in the Ksqui
malt and Nanaimo Railway Company
worth $6,000,000, a part of Alexander
Dunsmuir's estate, was about to be re
moved to British Columbia.
STORY IX AFFIDAVIT.
The story of the scheme to get the
stock beyond the jurisdiction of the
cuurts of California, as told in Hynes'
affidavit, follows:
The estate ol Alexander Dunsmuir is the
owner of certain capital stock of the Ksqui
ma,t and Nanaimo Hallway Company, of great
\alue. The stock is in the hands of certain
persons, firms and corporations, unknown to
this affiant, but the corporations are en
deavoring to send the stock beyond the Juris
diction of this court and to persons who are
not entitled to the same. There is rto duly
appointed, qualifier or acting administrator of
tho estate of deceased to take charge of the
stock and other property of deceased, and
unless some person forthwith be appointed
special administrator of the estate of said
Alexander Dunsmuir, deceased, the stock and
other property of said deceased will be sent
beyond the jurisdiction of this court and will
become lost to the estate of said deceased.
If the order heretofore made herein continuing
the hearing of affiant's petition that he be
appointed special administrator of the estate
of said Alexander Punsmuir, deceased, is not
vacated and set aside and affiant forthwith
appointed special administrator of the estate
of the deceased, the said capital stock and
Ottnr property belonging to the deceased will
be taken beyond the jurisdiction of this court
and will become lost to the estate of the de
ceased.
TELEGRAMS FROM XORTH,
In support of the affidavit. Public Ad
ministrator Hynes incorporated therein
the following telegrams from British
Columbia that were directed to Judge
John H. Burnett, who appears in the
case as one of the representatives of
Mrs. Joan Dunsmuir, who has joined
with Edna Wallace Hopper in the
fight for a division of the millions of
the dead coal baron.
Victoria, B. C April 8, 1905.
Judge John H. Burnett, 420 California street,
San Francisco, Cal.
See Horace Platt regarding 51 per cent of
Esquimau and Nanaimo Railway shares,
which are in San Francisco in the hands of
either Platfs clients or Canadian Bank of
(Y>mirier'-e Dunsmuir is making now deal with
ranadian Pacific Railway in Montreal to Bell
them control of the Esquimau and Nanaimo
shares. Alexander Punsmuir was owner of
one-quarter of the total shares, and If we
break the will James will eventually be ad
judged to be trustee for the Alexander Duns
mulr estate and of at least one-half If not all
of the shares purchased from Platfs clients.
It would he advisable to get the Public Ad
ministrator to in some way put an attachment
on the shares in San Francisco immediately,
to forestall the James deaJ In Montreal, which
may be closed any moment. Act quickly and
r^ply. D. M. ROGERS.

Judge John H. Burdett, 420 California street.

Hurry Deal closed to-day. Shares there
are worth ?6.000,000. D. M. ROGERS.
Judge Coffey was quick to catch the
importance of the new development,
but he refused to take action until the
representative of James Dunsmuir
could be heard. Attorney Charles S.
Wheeler was thereupon summoned, as
was Joseph C. Campbell, who represents
Edna Wallace Hopper and W. S. Leake,
executor of the estate of Sirs. Josephine
Dunsmuir, deceased, widow of the late
Alexander Dunsmuir. Wheeler came
into court and immediately began a
fight against the petition of the Public
Administrator. He said he could see
no reason why the special letters should
be granted, as the petition of the Pub
lic Administrator was based solely
upon hearsay, and the inventory of
decedent's estate contained no mention
of any stock in the Esquimalt and
Nanaimo Railway Company.
"That makes no difference," said
Judge Coffey." It frequently occurs
that property is not discovered until
after the inventory has been filed."
CONTINUANCE DENIED.
Then Mr. Wheeler asked for a con
tinuance. He had not had time, he
said, to investigate the new condition
that confronted him, as the action of
the Public Administrator had come
precipitately and as a surprise. Attor
ney Campbell joined with Attorney
Hickey in a protest against delay, Mr.
Campbell saying that his clients were
in favor of the granting of the letters
to the Public Administrator, that their
interests might not be jeopardized.
Wheeler said he should be given until
3 o'clock, but Judge Coffev recogniz
ing the necessity of a speedy hearing,
â would not consent to a later hour than
2 o'clock, and at that hour the petition
was again called for hearing.
Wheeler first objected to the court's
assuming any jurisdiction over the
case, contending that the court had
no jurisdiction to set aside the orig
inal order admitting a copy of de
cedent's will to probate and offered in
evidence in support of his contention
the entire record of the case by which
this copy was admitted and James
Dunsmuir subsequently discharged as
executor after the estate had suppos
edly been settled so far as the courts
of this State are concerned. He asked
for a ruling, however, on the motion
to set aside the order setting the hear
ing of the Public Administrator's orig
inal petition for letters for the 20th
inst. Judge Coffey said he would grant
the motion and take up the petition
forthwith.
Mr. Wheeler then renewed his con
tention that the court is without juris
diction and said that he would like
time in which to present proof that if
any court In the State has jurisdiction
over the estate of Alexander Dunsmuir
it is that of Alameda County, where
the deceased built a home and lived
for eight months prior to his death.
This move on the part of Mr. Wheeler
constituted the repudiation of all of
James Dunsmuir's acts as adminis
trator, for in his petition for letters
testamentary James Dunsmuir took
oath that the residence of Alexander
was in San Francisco; he so swore in
the proceedings in British Columbia,
and in the will 'of the deceased he
named San Francisco as his legal
place of residence. Judge Coffey
smiled knowingly when Mr. Wheeler
made this point, but Attorney Hickey
placed the facts of James Dunsmuir's
oath before the court and the court
ruled with him, denying Mr. Wheeler
the right to reopen the question of
residence which was decided recently j
by Judge Coffey when he set aside the j
proceedings before Judge Troutt ad
mitting a copy of Dunsmuir's will to i
probate.
+ t% n * *i_ .-. 'iitra i^unsinuir sv\ ear
mat the residence of Alexander Duns
muir was In San Francisco, but at the j
time he gave oath as executor of the
will he tuok oath to support the con- !
stituMc-n of the United States, this
while he was Premier of British Co- j
lumbia, a fact that created consterna- :
tion when it came to light in the pro- :
ceedings in the Victoria courts.
After counsel had concluded their ar- !
guments Judge Coffey said that not
withstanding how he might be inclined
in the case a showing had been made
which the court could not ignore, and
a refusal to grant the petition of the I
Public Administrator might result in
great loss to claimants in event they
should establish their alleged rights.
HÂ« therefore ordered that special let- '
ters issue. Mr. Wheeler took an ex- ;
ception to the ruling of the court."
As soon as the order directing that
the letters issue was signed by the j
court, Attorney Hickey rushed off and
served notice upon all of the re- i
spondents. This means that Edna Wal
lace Hopper and Mrs. Joan Dunsmuir
have in view hoarded wealth upon
which they can satisfy any judgment j
that may get against the estate after
their contest has been finally deter- !
mined.
ATTACKS THE EVIDENCE

Lawyer Belittles Testimony Given by
Witnesses for Edna Wallace

VICTORIA, B. C, April 11.â T. P. !
Davis continued reading evidence re- '

DENIES SPRINGER'S MOTION
TO REOPEN WTLL.EY CASE
Judge Troutt Rules the Verdict In
Favor of Mrs. Muirhead Was
a Just One.
Judge Troutt handed down a deci
sion yesterday denying the motion of
W. K. Springer for a rehearing of the
contest of the will of the late Charles
Walter Willey, who left his estate to
Mrs. Louisa M. Muirhead, and in
whose favor the jury decided. The
court's decision was oral, no written
opinion being filed.
Springer, through his attorneys,
Stoney & Stoney, sought to bring the
will contest to trial again on the
ground that the verdict was not sup
ported by the evidence. The attor
neys occupied two days in their argu
ment and went over all of 'the testi
mony that had been given before the
Jury. Judge Troutt, however, decided
that the jury was the judge of the
facts and had resolved them in favor
of Mrs. Muirhead. His order of yes
terday refusing to reopen the case is
in line with this view.

WINE MEN ASK
TO AFFILIATE
The California State Board of
Trade voted yesterday to institute a
viticultural section, a separate organi
zation, but affiliated with the board.
John P. Irish was appointed chairman
of the viticultural section, to organize It
and to bring it into legal relations with
the Board of Trade, which is an incor
porated body.
Percy T. Morgan, president of the
California Wine Association; Charles
A. Wetmore and R. M. Wood appear
ed before the board and requested the
formation of a viticultural section.
Mr. Morgan addressed the board at
considerable length and said that the
wir:e industry of California had no or
ganized body to represent it. The
Viticultural Commission had been
abolished; the Viticultural Club, or
ganized some time ago, had yet but
a small membership.
Mr. Morgan also spoke of the man
ner in which recent reports had been
made by the San Francisco Board of
Health concerning samples of wine
that they had analyzed. The winemen.
Mr. Morgan said, were interested in
having only pure wines made in Cali
fornia. The California Wine Associa
tion would guarantee every drop of
wine that is sent out from its cellars.
California wines were as pure as any
food product in the United States.
i For years the Wine Association had
I maintained a laboratory and had used
this and also added the efforts of the
association to have a pure food bill
passed.
The reports sent out by the San
Francisco Board of Health were cal
culated to greatly damage not only
the wine industry but the State of Cal
ifornia at large. They gave an incor
rect impression. The winemen had no
1 organization or headquarters and both
organization and headquarters were
! needed in just such an emergency as
I had recently arisen.
The Board of Trade promptly voted
to establish a viticultural section aux-
I iliary to the State Board of Trade.
Reports from the various sections of
the State concerning the orchard and
vineyard yield, which were received
yesterday in answer to a circular let
ter, show conditions to be generally fa
vorable. From the bay counties all
reports agree that practically no dam
age was done by the heavy rain
storms in March and the frost that
followed. In the coast counties the
storm did some damage, but there was
none from frost and conditions are good.
In the San Joaquin district the frost
was light and the damage likewise.
Throughout the Sacramento Valley
but slight damage is reported, and in
dications are good. The fruit crop
promises to be heavy. South of the
Tehachapi there was little damage, and
conditions are excellent.
