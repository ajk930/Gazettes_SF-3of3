'\ ST. PETERSBURG, June 30 (3 a. m.).â The -Russian
.. CQvernment. although it has been almost paralyzed by the terrible
events at Odessa and the news that the sailors at Libau have mu
,'tinied, is making desperate and even frantic. efforts to meet the sit
uation andstamp out the flames of revolution before 'they spread
to the army, which is now the last bulwark of the autocracy.
With Poland red with the spirit of revolt, the Caucasus al
ready almost in a state of civil war, agrarian disorders, spreading
\rapidly, .the whole country profoundly stirred and the intelligent
classes solidly- arrayed against the Government, all conditions seem
ripe for. the long-predicted revolution.
Demands Surrender of Mutineers
The first act of the Government, after- dispatching Admiral
Kruger's squadron from Sebastopol, was to summon the Knia2
Potemkine, whose mutineers have now been joined by the^ crews'
of the torpedo-boats which accompanied it to Odessa, to surren
der, under the threat of firing upon and sinking the vessel. This
was followed by the declaration of martial law at Odessa and
Libau and the clothing of the military commanders^with' plenary
powers. .
The newly formed Council for Imperial Defense met last
night under the presidency of Grand Duke Nicholas, and was in
session long after midnight. Beyond the fact that the temper.; of
the army was considered at length, nothing is known as to what
occurred in the council or regarding the decision- at which it
arrived.
Sedition in the Regiments
Great fear is expressed that many regiments are honeycombed
with sedition and there is grave doubt of their loyalty should they
be called upon to fire upon the revolutionists. Indeed, the most '
startling stories involving the unreliability of trie troops are being
repeated in St. Petereburg,;but theirutl?of 'imny:.of:tlicm''is7mqre^- ;
than questionable. ' :
What effect the news of the occurrences at 'Odessa will have
on the troops and the people in general is problematical, and- is puz
zling the press. â¢ A;
Agitators Spread the News
The precautions taken by the authorities to keep theTnews
from the public have been in vain, the Revolutionaries and
the Liberals everywhere spreading â¢it 'by {word of mouth, arid
within twenty-four hours it will be kn6vmim;the;uttermost: con
fines of European Russia.
When the news reaches. the armies in Manchuria'itis;bound
to create a deep impression. The authorities, however, realizing
that if was certain to leak out :\u25a0: and that there .would beVexag
gerated versions of it, and perhaps to pave (the way ; for; a^ public
announcement, are now sending some dispatches to the
papers; but these only contain information not)for publication.

' ST.. PETERSBURG, June 30.â 1t is reported that the
volunteer fleet cruiser Saratoff has been burned at Odessa.
Admiral Krugers orders are to summon the Kiiiaz Po
temkirie to surrender, and, if she refuse, sink her, after
which he is to assist in restoring order in : the town. A
dispatch, from Sebastopol amioimces that a squadron of

'started for Odessa, at 5 o'clock last evening^ This- ex^

So far as I have been able to ascertain,
after a careful investigation of the law. the
rovers *o conferred upon you as Sheriff are
indcpendentt and co-ordinate with these pos
tered by the police officers of the city and
county. (Sec 2, Chap IV, Article VIII of
Charier.) In the matter of the preservation of
the public peace, both your department an 3
that of the police have the powers of peace
officer*. <Sec. 617. Penal Code.) Both de
partments may act concurrently and Inde
pendently, and you are so advised.
Acting on .this opinion, Sheriff Curtis
detailed a number of deputies to preserve
order. One of these. Nell Duff, who was
detailed to protect* an old woman who
sells papers near the Flood Building:, was
several times eet upon by crowds of yell
ing boys, but he managed to beat them
off. The old woman was roughly handled
by young hoodlums Jn the scuffle.

CHICAGO, June 29.â The threatened
war In passenger rates to the East was
precipitated to-day by.thq Michigan Cen
tral, which filed notice with the .Inter-*
state Commerce Commission that on July i
1 It will sell tickets between Chicago and A
Eastern points at the differential rate
awarded It by the Board of Arbitrators. ;
'The differential rates win > apply over .
the Xew York Central as well "aa 'over
other cpnnectlona east of Buffalo.,' It Is
understood the Grand Trunk will meet
the new rates of the Michigan Central
by putting in rates of $16 first class and
$15 second class from Chicago to "New "
York on July 1. As the matter now *
stands the rates over the Mlohigan Cen
tral to New York will be $10 and $17 and
52. less over the Grand Trunk. Erie and
Wabash. The rates of the three latter
roads will not apply, however, . over the
New York Central, that road having re
fused to accept any differential business
except from the Michigan Central. * .

NEW YORK, June 29.â The ' offer that
induced , Chief Engineer John \u25a0 F. ; Wallace
to quit his post on the Panama canal
came from the Interborough Rapid
Transit Company of this city, operating
th*?- elevated and subway ; lines, and car
rios with it a salary of $40,000 a year.
\u25a0: Mr. Wallace. I am inexpreesibly disappoint
ed, not only becau Â»>e you have taken this step,'
but bfcauts you ficem Â»o utterly - insensible ot'
the -slciuiicance 'of ; , your conduct. ,f You come
with ir.c bald announcement that you quit
your tack at a critical moment, on the eve of
important work and in the 'midst' of reorganl
atlon plans under which you accepted your
position, with your department unperfected In
organization and when you know, too, that my
public duties call me to', the Philippines for
several months. I must-.be allowed to remind
you that when you were employed by the com
mission a little over a year ago you were only
rec^lylnsr $15,000 per annum : under your " for
mer position, and' that your salary was fixed
at the sum demanded by yourself â J25.000.". If
you had not desired the . position', you i need
not have* sousht or. accepted it, but I under
stand that quite the contrary was' the
case. â¢ â¢ â¢
Now, within twelve dayn after your arrival
upon the Isthmus, you s;nd me a cable which,
read in the light of what â¢ >ou say to-day,
â¢signifies your practical acceptance of an offer
of another position Inconsistent with : the per
formance of your duties on the Isthmus. I
am astonished that you : would be bo dlsre-
Kardful of the splendid opportunities of the
position which would have made you famous
the world over by the honorable performance
of your duty as chief engineer. \u25a0
In his statement Taft says that Wal
lace's wishes- were deferred jto in the re
orgranization^.iof the Panama Commis
sion and the chief engineer- expressed
his great satisfaction at every detail
of the proceeding. He had not been "in
the canal zone two weeks,^ " however,
after his last trip to Washington, be
fore he sent an urgent request for" per
mission to return, to:- the United States
on a mission of great importance.- This #
was granted and - Secretary Taft '.- met
Wallace "in New, York by_ appointment.
Wallace, at this meeting, announced,
to Taft that he had received an offer'
of a> position e:arr>-ing Â»>-s6 o,ooo. salary'
from a New York corporation and de
sired to accept it,- although he 'was
still .willing .to serve-as a- member of
the- Canal' Commission, though not as
chief engineer. When Taft had heard
Wallace -though, he replied in-partias
follows: , " \u0084 ... .. ; \u0084 -â-
This fact is disclosed in an important
statement issued from the office of the
Secretary of War, which reviews the re
lations of Wallace with the War Depart
ment-and with the commission since the
latter's reorganization last spring, quot
ing the several expressions of the chief
engineer of his satisfaction with the en
tire arrangement, and then gives practi
cally a verbatim account of the confer
ence' between Secretary Taft and Wallace
in New York, which concluded. with the
suggestion to the Secretary that Wallace
resign. The statement issued to-night con
cluues.with;the President's letter to Wal
lace, .dated â¢"Cambridge^ Mass., June 2b."
which reads:

Somewhere In the bay of San Francisco
an' adventurous whale, said to be a mori
*ur of -his kind. 1 . Is plunging recklessly
ameng the snips of commerce. Last
night the unusual visitor was . first seen
passing wjthin fifty feet of a wharf, and
â¢\for -n- tune it Â«.Â»,->Â«Â«) Â«sif he miphr
bump his eides against a pier or scrape
the fottom of the bay with his keel.
The monster f/om the outer world of
waters lashed about furiously in the enn
f.nes of the bay. to him a mere cape.
As he swam he sent clouds of b-prav
Klioiitlns into the air. bellowing "ah
l-.00-ah!" as the true cachalot thunders
*hen he scouts. Whether he ( will rind
his way back to old ocean or become a
marooned treasure of bone and oil on
Some muddy reach, within sight of ad
venturous harpies of the shore. Is a
conjecture naione whaling men.
JOnXSOV BEHOLDS 3IOXSTER.
The whale was first spied by Harry
the boatman at Folsom-str-et
, narf. . Johnson was in one of his
launches on his way from the Germau
cruiser Falke. Whâ¬ . within about fifty
feet of the wharf hi saw what he sup
. pr.*ed to be a huge pile or part of a
fcarpe loom up about one hundred fe*t
away from his boat When he perceived
that the thing moved and dashed the
v.ater Into foam he realized At once it
v.as a whale and put for the dock full
Fptfd.
. he whale swam calmly along, drawing
nearer to the wharf each moment. When
rrbotit fifty feet away, the animal rested
and spurted a vaporous spray, which as
cended into the air about twenty feet
7 his sttracted the attention of many per
sons en the wharf and for several mo
ments they stood spellbound, intently
watching the deep sea monster as he
lashed the water into foam and sent the
spray into the air.
After the whale had finished spouting
end lashing he bepan to swim leisurely
south, but kept within about seventy feet
.' of the wharves as he passed along. By
this time the news of the leviathan's
presence in the harbor had spread along
the water front and a long procession of
persons paraded the docks, their eyes
following the visitor as he swam toward
/isslon Rock.
The progress of the deep sea monster
â¢ was watched till he reached a point north
of Mission Rock. Here he changed his
course and began to swim eastward, as
If he intended to make a landing some
place along the Alaneda shore. The
whale seemed in no hurry and -paused
now and then to spout and lash the wa
â¢ ter.
During his progress along the wharves
the whale passed several barges and
. smaller boats, but made no attempt to
. molest any of them. As soon as the boat
. men caught sipht of the black mass plow
ing through the water they invariably
took pains to quickly change their
courser, fearing they might be tipped over
by coming In contact with the tall of the
â¢ whale.
SMELT WHALE'S BREATH.
.. Johnson was nearer the whale than any
lon* else along the docks.' He swears the
whale was between 100 and 120 feet long.
His excitement may be gauged by the
fact that the largest whales do not exceed
SO feet in length. Johnson said his clothes
were drenched by the vapfor cast up, as
the wind was bJowing: a 'gale 'and carried
the moisture more than a hundred feet,
the breath of the giant permeating the
wind. . .
Ed .Hendrickson.' one of, Johnson's em
ploye*, caught sight of the animal. Hen
<lrleksDn realized in a moment what the'
dark ibjoct was, and, thinking. Johnson
did not see the whale at first, began to
shout * warning to him. But his efforta
were unnecessary, for Johnson was al
ready doing the best he could to change
the course of his launch In order, to avoid
coming In contact with the; king of the
deep. \ .
If the whale continues In the course he
took when last Been he will undoubtedly
wind up some place on the Alamcda shore.
Should he' get that far over: it" is certain
he will be ttranded, for the .water, there
is very shallow. If the residents of Ala
merta see something lying on the shore
this morning they may: rest 'assured it' !s~
not a pile of .wood or a heap of .wreckage,
but a fortune \n blubber, \u25a0 possibljr 'carry-
Ing ambergris enough " to . make' the under"

CHICAGO, June 29.â Startling conditions
"in -the downtown district were revealed
to-day through a sudden settling of
ground under Chicago's streets and build
ings. The trouble Is attributed by the
engineers 'of tne traction companies to
the construction of 'the Illinois Tunnel
Company's conduits under the streetsl
A prophecy -of a ; catastrophe was made
at the office of the chief engineer of the
Chicago City Railway Company, H. B.
Fleming. .wltjhjthe. announcement. that the
highway at Jackson Boulevard and State
street had'. sunk ten Inches in two nights.
Engineers for the Union Loop Company
have known for a year that the earth
between ihe tunnel and. the street- was
giving way In many spots, and as a rer
suit it has-been necessary to Jack : up
structures in several places. Depressions
have appeared In the last few months
and threaten \u25a0 skyscrapers and other
buildings on ' floating foundations.
"There is going to bean awful finish
if something is not done to stop this.",
said Assistant Engineer Keogh of the
City Railway Company. He is- in charge
of the repairing of the tracks .where the
depression occurred at State street and
Jackson boulevard. "Investigation by
this company his. shown that the tun
nels are responsible for the giving way
of the earth under the street. 'It is a
serious proposition. If the_. bottom of
Chicago is going to drop out there is just
as much danger of the buildings going
as the street-car, tracks."

the abdomen and clubbed over the head
by F. A. Case, who conducts a poolroom
at Chino, to-night. The row was caused
by a poker game at Case's place.-
Young entered the place and asked to
be given a hand in the game, depositing
three white chips, a red chip and a half
dollar on the table. Case seized the red
chip as the house's property. In .the
dispute that followed,' Young caught him
by the throat and held him against the
wall. Case, who is a small man, quietly
drew his knife and Young withdrew, ask
ing that the matter be "fixed up." Case
walked to his coat, secured a revolver
and walking up to Young suddenly
plunged the knife in his stomach, at the
same time clubbing him over the head
with the revolver.
"Cash in, boys," said Case calmly,
walking back to the table.
Young, who had walked out of the place
without saying a word, was picked up

, SANTA CHUZ, June 29.â The Southern
Paciflc Railroad began hostilities against
the Ocean Shore Railway in this city to
day by commencing to build a spur track
from its main line to a point on the
waterfront where the electric road pro
moters expect to locate their wharf and
terminus. The lands of the Southern Pa
cific Join those of the Cowell Company
close to the water's edge and the track
men axe putting in an extra spur from
the Southern Pacific main line along the
course of Neary Creek. It is evident that
the object of the Southern Pacific is to
\u25ba prevent the Ocean Shore Road from
reaching the water front at this point.
The Cowell Company is said to have
asked the Ocean Shore promoters $50,000
for the land. This sum was refused and
condemnation proceedings were insti
tuted. The land is assessed for county
taxes at 54950. The Ocean Shore people
expect to have no difficulty in securing
en Injunction prohibiting the Southern
Pacific from laying any tracks jon the
disputed property until the condemnation
cult has been decided. In the meantime
thu Southern Pacific track force is losing
no time in petting the spur across to the
Cowell Company's land, Roadmaster Cor
rigan declaring it Is "purely a commer
cial cpur for the Cowell Company."
Feeling is 'high over the matter and
as the franchises of both the Cowell
Company and the Southern Paciflc for
their wharves have long since expired, it
Is suggested by active sympathizers of
the electric road that the City Council
grant the use of one of them to the
Ocean Shore people in case a settlement
cannot be arrived at with the Cowell
Company.

An investigation by , Detective George
Kyte revealed evidence which leads to
. the belief that a' woman who worked for
Miss Emma Mahoney. the f.irmer occu
.pant of the house, is the mother of the
infant, and that *he placed it In tlie
t-ellar, intending that death should "rid
her of Its unwelcome presence. This
woman was hired by Miss Mahoney to
aid In pa^-klng the household effects when
she decided to move, and came to her
from the home of Mrs. Montell Taylor,
by whom she has been employed . for
Fome time past. Miss Mahoney says ehe
knows nothing about the girl, who was
known- tp her only as "Annie." Mrs.
Taylor Is now In. the coontry and could
not be found to-day, so the full name of
the suspected woman has not yet been
learned by the police. They have, how
ever, a good description of thÂ«< woman.
'and the detectives are now making a dili
gent effort to locate her before she can
leave the city. It is thought that she wilt
be taken into custody in a few hours.
The woman for whom the police are
looking is Anna Andcrson f a domestic,
ab^Jt 35 years old. According tocher per
sonal ettects, found in a trunk at Mon
tell Taylor's residence, sne formerly re
*ided at Â£13 Fourth, street, Tacoma. *Miss
-Anderson left there in April, when she
\u25a0came.to Oakland, and was given employ
j ment at the Taylor residence.
When Mh>s Mahoney discovered yester
day morning that the girl was apparent
ly very ill 6he summoned Dr. N. H.
Chamberlain to attend her, but when t the
physician arrived i-.e woman refused to
allow him to make an examination or to
. tell him the cause of her illness. Dr.
Charaberlain said to-day that the girl
had the appearance of one who had un
dergone .a severe ordeal of some kind.
.but -when fluestloned she said that she
had been badly frightened the night be
, fere by a. man who had come to the front
.door on Tuesday evening and demanded
admission to the house.
After the physician's departure Miss
Mahoney told the girl that as she was
unable to, work she had better go home
â¢and rest-/ The young woman told her
employer that she womd so to the home
ct a friend who lived near, and shortly
afterward left the house. She did not
give her friend's address.
Among Anna Anderson's effects was the
address, Ida Swa.nson, 2013 Central ave
nue. Alameda. Miss gwanson, who 1b a
domestic employed at that place by Dr.
C. G. Bull, told the Oaklan^ police to
night that she met Miss Anderson a
month ago. but knew nothing of her
whereabouts now, nor of her personal
affairs. The baby was sent to-night to
the West Oakland Home.
The police to-night arrested Pete*- Nel
son, 26 years old, a carpenter residing at
Sir Eighth street, who admits that Miss
Anderson followed him from the north.
Nelson disclaimed any responsibility for
li*r condition and knew nothing of her
pretest whereabouts..
The clertryman h.id just moved into the
house, which nas vacated only yesterday,
anil last nipht ho heard the crying of the
chiia. but thought the noise was the
moaning: of ihn wind or the cry of some
ftnlmal In the neighborhood. The con
tinuation of the sound this morning, how
ever, caused him to make an investiga
tion, and he finally traced the sound to
the basement of his dwelling. He at once
notified the police by telephone and Pa
trolman James Walters was sent to the
scene, and on searching the basement fie
found the tiny child concealed under an
overturned fruit box In a remote corner
of the cellar. "*."":"" :

Justice : /as in grave, danger. of mts%
carrying in his case, William R. Mhoon.
barber, informed Police Judge Cabanis3.
for Instead of being in court accused
of wife-beating he should be pressing
a charge of husband-beating against
liis. accuser. Would, the court : be- so
good as to \ look at her _ uhmarred face
and, inspect his blackened eye and
scratched countenance and then decide
whetiier he or the woman -displayed
most evidence of. having been -battered?
"You certainly ' show" more > facial
damage than she does," the Judge said;
"but is she the author of your in
juries?"
A portion of them, Mr. Mhoon replied.
She was responsible; for the scratches,
while, the ... eye discoloration- was. the
handiwork of her gentleman friend,
name not revealed.,
\u25a0 "Ah, .the man in the case," said his
Honor. 'JS3B
Then the story came out. Mr. Mhoon,
who is tall *and slender, was employed
in the big tonsorial establishment in
the Winchester Hotel building on Third
street, and from there ; on' 'June -26 -he
went to his home, 1004 Harrison street,
his footsteps being lightened by' his
eagerness to rejoin she whom he led
to the altar two months ago, after re
siding with her out of wedlock for
four consecutive years.. When he en
tered the domicile he .was pained to
perceive dangling from' a i clothes fa,ck
some masculine apparel which was not
his own, and when lie requested his
wife, whqse baptismal name is May, to
explain the presence of the strange
garb, she rather tartly told hinvitwas
the property of a gentleman friend of
hers, whom she was entertaining.; By
argument he tried to instruct her that
it was not proper form for ; a .wife to
entertain masculine visitors,' semi-de
nuded of clothing, while her spouse was
absent, and thus the fight started..;'.-!;:
Testimony conflicted as- to who ad T
ministered the first blow. : May \u25a0 swore
that William opened actual combat by
kicking one of her knees.*- and William
Just as positively swore that she sprang
at him like an enraged wildcat 'and
was engaged in the act of scratching
his face with; all of her finger nails
when her. gentleman, friend emerged
from concealment, smote him heavily
on the left eye and then disappeared,'
taking away :. ith him the tell-tale- at
tire. Then the wife went and filed com
plaint charging the husband with bat
tery.
After carefully weighing, the; clash
ing narratives,' the Judge decided that
Justice would \be best ' served .\u25a0 by Mr.
Mhocm'si probat|#.iary ( restoration to

Th> Grand Jury< lias given up its
ccmnilttee-room in the Mills building,
and will henceforth use only the rooms
at the City Hall.
Levy was called as a witness anil
asked for what the check had been
paid. The witness became confused
and told conflicting stories. He first as
serted that the money was given to
Wailtufel as a .commission for selling
goods; thon declared that It was paid
for some cooperage work.
Walteufel stoutly maintained that he
was neither hi the employ of the Fed
eral nor the municipal government
when the work was done. Foreman
Andrews believes, from the date of the
check, that Walteufel was in the em
ploy of the Federal Government when
the money was paid, therefore he will
pass the matter up to tlie Federal
Grand Jury. The investigation showed
that the Assessor's office is in no way
involved.
Foreman Andrews examined all the
clerks in the ' Assessor's office, \u25a0 the
Sheriff's office, the Auditor's office and
the County Clerk's office, with a view
to ascertaining: how many of them paid
tributo to the Schmit? Central Club.
Only two in the Sheriffs office and
thre^ - In the Assessor's office admitted
that they were contributors.
In the Sheriff's office, the Assessor's
office and the County Clerk's office all
the clerks subscribe to "ticket funds,"
which are devoted to patronizing vari
ous, charities. \u25a0^^' i \-'-K~.
The industry" of J. A. Walteufel, who
for six months of the* year is employed
as an internal revenue inspector and
during the other six months is employ
etl In the Assessor's office, was looked
into by Foreman Andrews of the Grand
Jury yesterday. Andrews lias in his
possession a chock for $25 paid to
Walteufel by Nathan Levy, a liquor
dealer at COS Mission street.

said he had .been granted a. telephone

1 WRITES TO aiAYOR.
The : Home Telephone '\u25a0 Company;- of Los . An
geles is 'at present dominated and controlled
by a croup of financiers and bankers whose
sole purpose .Is to ; make ' the . watered stock of
that organization pay ' dividends regardless lof
its earning \u25a0 capacity ror of J Its service. They
also control \u25a0 the < lonK-distanca company and
the- subsidiary organisations. To Increase the
opportunities of: the immensely profitable.long
distance : company they find It necessary to
have San Francisco and Portland. A franchise
in San Francisco would : also give â¢; them \u0084\u25a0 an
other ; opportunity of unloading : oh the ' con
fiding public several millions of watered stock.
The ; watered ': stock : of the Los Angeles . com
pany . has , been boosted <on the market . by the
prompt . payment of I dividends until I the | public
la eager. to pay. and are paying $61 per share.
| The rates established by the Home Company
at the start were ~ below the cost \u25a0of . a 10,000
telephone sen-ice. Three-year contracts ' were
taken. They now claim ll>,ooo phones â¢In ser
vice:. The three-year . contracts have expired.
The rates have not been increased, though
the cost of the service to-day must be twice
what they are - charging. Still they pay divi
dends promptly. I am told that some of their
issue : of 52.5C0.0C0 stock Is still unsold.

ment says in part:
For years ' the efforts "to enthuse the public

THE President had a regular "boy's time" at Harvard with the
members of his class and his old professors. Then he gave
the university a man's talk. ; His address glistened with good
points, with appeals for real democracy in life, and in Government,
for the plain and substantial virtues, for tHe foundations of char
acter. , ; :; - , '. ; ; '\u0084 ~',\ -.*\u25a0;
His balancing of things in this statement may well be studied,"
pondered and heeded: "Thcvery rich man who conducts his bust
ness as if he believed that he is a law unto himself , thereby im
mensely increases the task of upholding order when disorder iis a
menace to property. When the community feels that rich-; men dis
regard the law when it affects themselves, then the community is
apt to assume the dangerous and unwholesome attitude. of condon
ing crimes of violence against the interests which in the popular
mind these rich men represent. This last attitude is wholly evil, but
so is the attitude which produces it. It is far more important that
they conduct their business affairs decently than that they should
spend the surplus of their fortunes in philanthropy."; '\u25a0!{%%-*
In analysis this has a meaning that should not be lost i sight of.
If the men under criticism subject themselves to the restraints /of
law and morals, the field to which they devote their surplus wealth
will be less needful of philanthropy. Men who produce evils which
they assuage by use of the means, which caused it are entitled to
no credit for philanthropy. > \ > -
The. President^ not content to limit his; speech to
of learning, but goes far beyond by impressing' his i hearers with the
sober responsibility of "the learned to society, whose institutions'
have enabled the' acquisition of knowledge:; The. learned ;man with
out high purpose is like a tool, without an edge, pott ntiali of â¢ list*,

If the young men and women go - from; the many; college; com

THE PRESIDENT AT HARVARD:
A man who was too economical to sub
scribe for hi* home paper sent his lit*
tie boy to borrow the copy taken by his
neighbor. In his haste- the boy. ran over
a W ": stand *of bees and in ten minutes
looked, llka a warty summer squash. His
cries reached bis father, who ran to his
assistance, and falling to notice a barbed
wire fence, ran Into it. breaking It down,
cutting a handful of flesh from hi 3 anat
omy and ruining a $3 pair of pants. The
old cow took advantage of the gap in tha
fence and got into the cornfield and killed
herself i eating green corn. Hearing the
racket | the wife ran, upset a ' four-gallon
churn of rich cream into! a basket of
kittens, drowning '\u25a0 the Â» whole lot. In
her dhurry she dropped a J2S set of false
teeth- .The . baby, . left alone,, crawled

PIONEERS NEED HELP
THE crew of a warship has ere this refused to fight in order to
punish. a cruel" commander, but the seizure of a man-of-war by
the crew and the turning of its guns against its Government
[' never happened until now. The capture of the Kniaz Potemkine
in the Black Sea and using its guns to defy the Russian Govern
ment by laying siege to Odessa have startled the world. It fur
nishes an explanation of the poor showing made by the ships of
â¢^Rojestvensky. Those crews were no doubt affected by the same
spirit cf mutiny that is said to be rife on the whole Black Sea fleet.
The cause must be sought in the, official rottenness of Russia. Graft
'and greed intercept the funds intended for the equipment of armies
and ships. The result is bad food and bad ammunition, and starva
tion and misery overcoming the demands of discipline.
.For ages Russia has answered every petition, for better condi
tions with flogging and death. In Poland, in Bessarabia and in
Finland, only cruelty and murder, degradation and denial of human
rights have been the response of the Government to protest and
petition, however mild and respectful. The liberties of the Grand
Duchy of Finland were destroyed in violation of a solemn treaty.
In Poland the language and religion of. the people have been' treated
as crimes, and to speak the one or enjoy the other in; secret has
tyeen punished .with appalling severity: The Je\vs .of Bessarabia
have been, denied/the rights that man elsewhere/ freely [givef to
iour-footed beasts. The empire has been treated as ; the : private propf
of the Grand Dukes; headed by the : Czar; The^ortlibdox: church
:';â¢ nas sternly repressed â¢freedom of conscience, denied the rights of
reason and of private judgment to the^people, for the sake, of their
a^ouls. . \u25a0;\u25a0 -; : \u25a0 ' V;;:. :\u25a0\u25a0 \ .
Such has been "Holy Russia/ Now the bonds /of superstition
are .breaking. The people observe that under cover of solicitude for
their state in the next world their condition in this has become in
tolerable. Excepting the Cossacks, descendants of the savage Scyth
ians, the troops of the line and the reservists have discovered that
they are not fighting Japan for their country, but for the Grand
Dukes, that their private property in national territory may be en
larged and that their system of slavery, called government, may be
extended over the millions of Eastern Asia. Man, everywhere, no
matter how sodden and sordid his condition, has in him the same
spark of sentiment and feeling.
The knout and Cossack whip have not beaten this spark out of
the soul of the Russian, i Blindly, badly led, ignorantly moved, per
haps they know not by what, the people, Jew and Gentile, student,
mujik, soldier and sailor, Pole and Finn, all over the wide empire
are in revolt against cruelty and misery. The Czar kisses the shin
bone of St. Serafin and listens to ghost stories about Makaroff,
standing in a halo on his sunken ship under the waters of Pechili
Bay, prophesying victory, and prays. The Grand Dukes cower in
their palaces, while the roar of revolt rumbles from the Gulf of
Jkrthnia to the Black Sea. ,
If Russia had the form of a Government, though bad, its awful
plight would invoke the pity of the world. But it is not a govern
ment in any proper sense. It is a private procession, the personal
estate of the Grand Dukes. They have mismanaged it. They have
scourged the people to the task of making bricks without straw.
They have demanded of their soldiers miracles of valor on rotten
bread and sawdust ammunition. The burden has proved too, great
and human nature has rebelled. Some - apologetic observers assert"
that the freedom of a constitutional Government is not suited to the
present condition of ignorance in which, the Russians wallow. , But
.these apologists will, we suppose, admit that human beings deserve
a better Government than the Russians have. When the intelli
gence of Russian professors and students is vjoined; with; thefig
norance of the masses, in a demand for somethingVbetter,; why not
prune the autocracy and give popular power to the intelligent Rus
sians who demand it, with progressive participancy in the Govern
ment held out as the reward of progressive intelligence ?J>Why riot
endeavor to replace fear as a military motive by a genuine pa
triotism among the people?
It is a grim and awful spectacle, Odessa under the guns of a
warship, manned by mutineers, with a dead sailor, killed for pro-
testing, lj'ing stark on the dock. It should cause even the Procura
tor of the Holy Synod to question the cruel and unfeeling. policy that
he has urged upon the' Czar in the name ibi v religion. \ It should
cause absolutism everywhere to awaken to a sense of the power of
instinctive manhood, surviving misery and oppression.

"I received the massage from the
spirit world," declared â¢ Mrs. Arens.
"When I went into ; trances the spirits
of Edwin Eldridge, Augustus Bartlett
and Judge Rice , came to me from the
fourth dimension and told me to de
liver the massages to Mr. Bartlett"
The Bartlett Estate Company, com
posed bt the hairs of Erastus Bartlett,
alleses that In 1891, through a con
spiracy existing between Hugh Eld
ridge and "Hattie Arens and Elizabeth
Tully, vtwo spiritualists, Bartlett, then
82 ..years- old, was induced to believe
that he had deeded his half I, interest
in 640 acres of Bellingham Bay land
to Eldridge. 1-
In the same year the plaintiffs de
clare that the two mediums, through
their ghostly advice, induced the old
man to make a request In writing that
the deed be recorded. The friends of
Bartlett in the spirit land, ; who, ac
cording to the plaintiffs, took an un
seemly interest in worldly real estate
deal 3, also advised the aged capitalist
to write a declaration that he ; had
given the deed to County. Treasurer D.
B. Edwards of Bellingham Bay. v
The plaintiffs declare positively that
no such deed was ever signed or filed.
Tho trial of the case* will take place
before the court at Bellingham Bay.
Medium Arens, part of whose depo
sition was taken yesterday in the
offices of Thomas, Gerstling & Frlck
before Notary Public Clement Bennett,
became indignant when her intimate
knowledge of the doings of the, spirit
land seemed in question. She said that
she did advise the old man to sign the
deed in question. She received the
order from the ghosts of his j departed
friends, who worked out business prob
lems in the realm of shades.
At times the medium branched into
dissertations on spiritualism and ap
peared almost ready to go into one of
her "trances." The deposition of the
dealer in ghostly messages; could not
be finished yesterday, as some letters
that, were sent by her to old Bartlett
had not arrived from. Bellingham Bay.
It is expected that her deposition will
be completed this * morning. Then - the
other go-between for ghosts, Elizabeth
Tully, will be heard.
Part of the deposition 'of Trance
Medium Hattie Arens in the Erasmus
Bartlett estate, contest was taken yes
terday. The 'woman ., admitted that she
had delivered messages ; to Bartlett ad
vising- him to deed his share In an $80,
000 l.iece of land in : Bellingham Bay
to Hugh Eldridgre of that town and his
wife.

Monument.
If we were to assemble all
. those who have been cured of
heart disease by Dr. Miles'
. Heart Cure, and who would
to-day be in their graves had
not Dr. Miles' been successful
in perfecting this wonderful
heart specific, they would pop-
ulate a large city.
.*'\u25a0\u25a0 What a remarkable recordâ
, a breathing, thinking, moving"
monument, composed of human
\u25a0 lives, â that for which every
other earthly possession is sac-
â¢ rificed.
The Miles Medical Co. re-
ceive thousands of letters from
these people like the following :
"I feel Indebted to the Dr. Miles'
oHeart Cure for ray life. I desire to call
the attention of others suffering: as I
did to this remarkable remedy for the
heart. For a Ion? time I had suffered
from shortness of breath after any -
little exertion, palpitation of the heart;
and at times terrible pain in the region
of the heart, to serious that I feared
that I would some time drop dead upon
the street. One day I read one of your
circulars, and Immediately went to
my druggist and purchased two . bot-
tleÂ» of the Heart Cure, and took it
according- to directions, tvlth the
result that I am entirely cured.: Since
then I never miss an opportunity to
roeommend this remedy to my friends
T-ho ha\-e heart trouble; in 'fact I am
a traveling 1 advertisment. for I am
widely known In this locality."

The annual tennis tournaments for
the women's and men's championship
of the State will commence on the
Hotel Rafuel courts at San Rafael this
morning \at 10 o'clock. Play to-day
will be confined to women's singles, the
opening games of the men's meet being
set" for to-morrow. Ten fair racket
wielders entered the women's tourna
ment, while twenty-six players will
compete in the men's event.
The entry list of the women's singles
is larger and possesses more class than
was expected. Of the ten players en
tered. Miss Ratcliffe of Berkeley is by
far the cleverest- One of her hardest
matches will be her, first. In the pre
liminary round she will meet ; Miss
Bessie Valleau of Alameda., The latter,
with Miss Wegener, will probably
prove Miss Ratcl iff e's most dangerous
opponents. ' ' . .
In the first round Miss Ethel Smith
and Miss Wcgrener will furnish a good
match, as will Mrs. Wattson and the
winner of the Ratcliffe-Valleau- match.
Miss Hl tchkiss. the present champion,
will not defend.
. In three of the quarters of the men's
tournament the prominent players are
well distributed, but in the/ fourth

STAXDIXG OF THE CLUBJS.
RENO, June 29.âFrom all indications
the crowd at the Hart-Root fight will be
much larger than the one that witnefsed
the great Corbett-Fitzslmmons battle.
The seats are selling at a. lively; rate.
Secretary Egan of the Reno Athletic Club
slated to-day that every seat In the im
mense arena, which has a seating capac
ity of nearly 7000, will be sold.
Lou Houseman of Chicago, accompanied
by a large number of sportsmen from
that city, arrived here last evening. He
declares Root will be the next champion
and that Monday's contest will be a great
fight. He says the Chicago fighter. Is; in
perfect trim.- Root will arrive in, the
city Saturday morning. Â£ He will be ac
companied by his trainers and by a num
ber of Salt Lake and -Ogden sports. He
will train for the few days remaining 'in
this city. . _ "
i Hart seems to be getting^ stronger and
faster every day. He enjoys being
punched by . his trainers and does" not
hesitate to punish ; - ; them in return , .for
their ' blows. . In \u25a0 a"J two- round bout with
Big Jack McCormack to-day he sent Me-
Connack to the floor three times. The
third tirae McCormack was completely
out. Hart did this after boxing sevsral
fast rounds with Roberts and Thompson,
his other trainers. McCormack claims
the Kentuckian has gained In speed and
that he can punch harder than he ever
did before. Betting is at .even mon<?y
anu a great deal of xoin is being placed.
There are a number of admirers of Hoot
in the city from Utah and they are offer
ing plenty of Root money. Hart money is
also being offered in sums of considerable
size. As a result wagers are easily
made. *

LONDON', June 29. â Most of the
American tennis players at Wimbledon
to-day were lightly engaged and in
view of the heavy rains and the wet
state of the courts this was a decided
advantage. Upon Miss May ;"Â«atton,
however, the gloomy, surroundings and
the depressing atmosphere apparently
had no effect. She was again the cen
ter of attraction and when "she went
into the court smiling and confident to
engage Miss Winifred Longhurst, the
Irish champion, there were few among
the hundreds present who did not an
ticipate her, victory.
As a matter of fact Miss Sutton soon
put away all tloubt of the issue by at
tacking with even more than. her usual
force. Miss Longhurst is 'one of the
most experienced woman 'players in
Great Britain, but she could make no
Impression whatever against the wily
driving and consistent playing of. the
little Californian. It is true Miss
Longhurst began well by making the
score "three all" In first set, but after
this stage she fell almost entirely .to
pieces, adding to her troubles by serv
ing many double faults.
Miss Sutton, grimly in earnest from
start to finish, won the first set by 6-3
and the second set by 6-1. She is now
among the last eight players left in
competition for to-morrow. She Is
drawn to play Miss Ethel Thomson, the
runner-up for the championship in
1903. If she survives this round she
will have gone a long way toward se
curing the coveted trophy and cham
pionship at which she is aiming.

MISS SUTTON
IN LAST EIGHT
. The game had passed into * the tenth
spasm when Smith opened up with a
double sacker against" the center field
fence and Dillon advanced v him- with an
out. Tozler soused to . Gochnauer, '\u25a0; who
winged the ball to the pan and Wilson
had his man \u25a0 frozen. * But there was no
glue on the mitt, the jbajÃrolled away
and Smith won the game" for "the Angels.
The Southern delegation started out in
the first as if -they were going to ": make
a- hundred runs.* > Bernard was passed and
Flood and | Smith â¢ bunts. % Bernard
tried to come home ; on the , latter " hit; but
Wheeler \u25a0 recovered . the : ; ball \u25a0in time to
wing i it :. to the : plate and save a : run.
Dillon happened along with a hit Just
then, scoring Flood. The brilliant start
produced but one little tally.
Wright' passed â¢ Irwin ; in the second and
he had no trouble in. reaching -second.
There were' two gone; and it bad.
Johnny Gochnauer/ proved the i pinch kid,
slapping out a ; double to left field that
tangled up the score for nine Innings.
The Angels came near ; breaking it all
up in the eighth; There was but one
gone? and two on the bases when Dillon
came to bat. Wilson made Williams walk
the big fellow and take a chahce= on
Tozier. The latter drove one ' at Goch
nauer that looked like a; hit. Johnny
grabbed the ball, winged it to second and
Wheeler relayed \it \u25a0-. to ; first in time to
cut , off the . run and complete ; a double
play that \u25a0 was one of the ; best the fans

! Of course the Angels hit the leather
hard enough to, make a dozen runs, and
they secured enough bases 'on balls to
swell the total to another twelve. But
it's the same old grind with them. They
can put men on - the sacks and : then ; for
sake them like"" a lot of outcasts. .The
Seals had all the luck and so the game
was prolonged.
Mr. Wright, formerly of Cleveland and
other, seaport towns, showed : the fans be
has everything a good pitcher should
possess/ But for the fact that a young
ster was taking his curves, the Seals
would not have made a run. Wright Is
a pitcher like Overall,' and If he twirls
as he did yesterday he will beat a good
many ball teams in this league. '
The Angels tried out Conrad from the

youngster is a good natural ball player
with a ! strong wing that worked so ; rap

Seals were on the bases. The 'â¢ busher
hits the' ball well, poking out a double

Slaying up nights after his hard days of
toil to nurse a lifelong friend and, then
seemg !death claim him was too much for
youns "Albert Westphal to bear, and, as
sailed by the deepest melancholy, wan and
haggard, ho .walked' last night from his
homo .at 221 Connecticut street out on
the trestle across Islais,Creek and plunged
into the water. His body is still beneath
the. waves, but. perhaps he has joined be
yond the ; friend he -so dearly loved j and
detply "mourned. \u25a0'.' ? :'ij>--'' 1 -- ' . ,- - \u25a0
Westphal sprang to his death while Po
liceman iWilliam Flynn; of the Potrero
station, who was pursuing him, was with
in fifty feet of . him. Flynn ; left the sta
tion; to take Westphal Into custody oh the
complaint of the young man's friends,
who feared that, he would; take his own
life. . The policeman . started dowq Ken
tucky street jto Westphal's home. *. When
he neared- the railroad trestle, which
spans Islais Creek between Kentucky and
lowa streets; he observed', Westphal
standing on the edge, looking into the
dark waters beneath. Flynn yelled; "Hey,
Westphal/; I want to see you.'.' Westphal
gave a startled ; look at the" approaching
policeman. Then, without a word 'of out
cry, he* leaped'forward and when the awe
stricken Flynn reached 'the spot .nothing
but a few bubbles marked the place where
the form of Westphal had disappeared. .
â¢ Last Sunday Robert E.Tiemari", a rope
worker living at* 218 Minnesota street,
died after a short illness. Westphal,. also
a rope worker,; had been his lifelong
friend and had nursed him at the last.
Night after night Westphal sat up with
"Pieman after, his long day's work. His
eyes wore a haggard look and 'misery
lined his face. Still he persisted in stay
ing by his friend. When' the; end came
Sunday Westphal's grief ; mastered ' him.
He seemed to have lost reason. Yesterday
at Tiernan's funeral h,e acted strangely.
Last night the police and friends of the
suicide dragged the creek for the young
man's'remains without success. The wa
ter's of Islais Creek are turned to a swiftly
running current by: the tides and Weat
phal's body may always rest beneath the
waves.
Westphal was : the only support iof a
widowed mother. He was 23 years old.
SURETY COMPANIES | ARE V
WORKING THE POS7OFFICB
Engage in '? a Xwild } Scramble to Go on
Uu tills at- the 50 Cent
Rate.
By a recent act of Congress, postal
officials havo been allowed\to change
the sureties on their bonds and to file
new ; bonds. In consequence there has
been a free-for-all scramble ; on the
part of rW-alLijurety. companies," to^ se
cure the. business...* The first move, and
it Is believed to bea master one. was
made by; the National Surety/Company,
which entered Into a contract .with. the
preslden t ; of the Postoffice Clerks' As
sociation whereby ;all the members of
the association were to be landed by
the company at the : rate;. of .50 cents
per annum for each $1000 of bonds.
Recently the . surety . company - an
nounced that, as the' association had
broken Ithe agreement by allowing
some of its members to get bonds from
other companies, the - rate would: be
raised after July 1. -This precipitated
the scramble, and the Federal Bond
Company offered" to bond all postal em
ployes at the rate of 60 cents, and_ their
agents have been busy in all the post
offices of the United States signing con
tracts for " bonds. Hearing j: of this, : it
is said, the National Surety Company
came down to \ the 50 cent basis, 1 -: and
it is trying to save all that it can from
the wreck, all of which is good for the
postofflce people. "â¢""; r ; .\u25a0--.*â¢ \u25a0_

GRAND JURY RETURNS CHECK
TO TREASURER McDOUGALD
Poper on Which $15,590.08 WaÂ» Paid
to Ex-Tax Collector Smith Will
: Be Preserved aa Memento.
City Treasurer McDougald yesterday
received from the Grand Jury the
check made out on April 20 last by
ex-Tax Collector Smith, upon which his
chief deputy, Louis A. Devoto, oblig
ingly turned over $15,590 03 to Smith,
who decamped with the money and
other funds belonging to the city, ilc-
Dougald has framed the check and will
hang it up in his office as a memento
of the transaction. I McDougald has re
paid $10,500 of the amount to the city
and will be 'obliged to produce the bal
ance unless the surety company on De
voto'sbond agrees to stand the loss.
McDougald recently discovered that the
bond is worthless, as it did not bind
the company to make good any loss
resulting from a "mistake" or "error
of judgment" committed by Devoto.

NEW TORK, June 29.â Prices ' lost some
ground tin the Ftock Exchange to-day and
there was s shrinkage in the dimensions in
the market which had more to do in giving
character to it than did thÂ« reduction In
prices. The money market yielded some pre
monitory symptoms of the preparation for the
July settlements. Call loans were reported'
light c\-en while there was no marked change
in the rate, and there was a considerable pay
ing off on the part of the borrowers eÂ«Â«'eall.
This was evidently in the expectation that the
borrowing- to-morrow, which is to calry over
until Monday, might result in a f!urr;y 'n the
money market. The rise in call joans to
above 3 per cent before the close conflnPed this
belief. The gra\-e aspect of internal v affairs
in Russia and the outbreak of violence in
Odessa brought into renewed <JleÂ«t3e*ion\ the
possible future demand on New-york for gold.:
Foreign Mock markets recelved-'tbe news. with
*reat placidity, the pries t>< 'French, rentes
making a full recover}- of *a opening decline.
London discounts yielded, *a fraction owing: to
the Immense first half-rear settlements and
the price of rold recÂ«-**d in. London.- There
â¢w-ss little change in ,Â«Ae local exchange rate.
The news â¢ from O**Â»sa was of \u25a0 more \u25a0 imme
diate effect in the .grain markets owing- to the
importance of th.*t point es a port for export
wheat.. The- â¢â¢ prospect of, an interruption of
tl* supply Â«& wheat by means cf the closing of
thÂ»t por*. tended as an . influence. Estimates
en -*;*jeat and corn received during the day
were 1 highly favorable. There was also an
early; decline in cotton. To-day's news is thus
eeen to have* supplied influences favorable to
hlrhÂ«r prices for stocks. Later efforts to
ward I recovery were defeated by the rise in
call Pioney rates.. The market closed easy at
about. t he lowest of the day.- Bonds were ir
| ref" l^. Total nalÂ«e, par value, $2,735,000
, United States. Bonds were all unchanged on
r call. ' t - . .

Late advices from New Tcrk say:
â¢â¢There was a er*-i\<rr display of buying in
terest in future dried fruits on the part of
local Jobbers, but it did not result in any very
larrÂ« transactions. The reported upward ten
<3*n<T of prWs on thÂ« Coast is having the ef
fect of making buy* rÂ« more l^ady to negotiate.
but thÂ«?y fÂ«*m reluctant to meet sellers' views,
and actual buslne** Is confined within com
paratively narrow limit*. In both California
and Oregon PRUNES the tendency of the mar
ket is upward. According tc reports received
ere yesterday there are now very few sellers
of Santa Claras of the new crcp for October
Fhipmfnt below a3e f. o. b. tap basis. Orders
for a few raxs were ccr.flrmed on a 29Â£ c t. o. b.
basis y**t<!rday, however. Buyers do not seem
to bÂ» actively interpft<"l and r.o Inquiries for
ccnslderable quantities are reported. I Some
brokers report having done a good business In
future PEACHES and APRICOTS, but mast
of them complain of elark interest on the part
of buyers anÂ£ have only occasional carload
or*Â»rs to report. The market for future-
PEACHES on the Coast is firm with most sell

Orcsron Crop Bulletin.
The report of Edward A. Beals. section
director United States Weather Bureau, for
the Oregon crop bullet:', veek e^*d June
-7. is as follow.:
The- past week has b?'* showerj' â¢Â«* C Â°O'> !
Â«Â«peelally during the c-ternoons. when the
tesaperature was usually lour or fi v Â« degrees
teiow nonaal. The rB-.:.s have been beneficial
to spring grain and the cool days hay* been j
iavorable for fall wheat ana bar>r. which ,
is now headics and f.air.g nicely. The oaaip j
weather has caused the praln ar-i'Â» to be- 1
come more nuroerou? in the Wiil&mette Â» al- |
ley. wyiere many fitiis of eprir.g wheat and '
cats are bafily lnf ec-.cd with this pest. Oats ;
Ere turning red in some localities and the |
crop generally Is cot doing so well as ex- I
Pected. Forage crops are generally hÂ«avy
an<j pasturace is much better t-an usual at
this time of the year. The first crcp ot alfalfa
fcas been *e cured in eood condition and the |
Wscond crop promises to bÂ« above the average j
la quality. Haying, -n-iilch vu becoming gen
eral, has been delayed by Uxe rair.s. and some |
hay cut lr. the fields has beer, niore or lesi
Injured by the wet weather. Fotatoes and
gardens Ere making splendid growth. Hop*,
although ur.even are r.ow mak:^S s&tlsfactorj'
rrocresa. Cherries are ripe esi plentiful in
the market, although the cror H considerably
tmUUir tian usual. Apples, peaches, prunes
and pean continue to raak* g>:i advancement.
but the fruit crop generally will be lighter
than ucssJ owing to frosts aoo cold rains at
the time of oolleclzation.
Stock Market Ontloolc
The New Tork circular of J- S. Bach* &
Co. ears:
"The political situation i* much clearer.
Presider.t Roosevelt's astute diplomacy has
bnnirht Japan and Russia together In the
Interests of peace. The M rocco question,
wtolleT-c* entirely disposed ot is in a position j
m-herÂ« an amicable adjustment of difference s
between France and G*rma-y may be brought
about. SÂ« far as the Equitable Is concerned.
Grover Cleveland's acceptance of the position
as a trustee has gone a 10-g way toward re
ajseurlng the public, and the Hendricks report
furnishes assurance that the company's affairs
henceforth will be adn-.:r:;stered on business
principles. From a irarket standpoint the
Kqu Stable may be disregarded In future.
* --Business conditions leave little to be it
t'.t*<i. General business is catisfactory and
railroad cross earnings reflect a heavy mov*Â»
roer.t of merchandise. Tie steel trade, while
somewhat dull In light f.sisbed steel, is par
ticularly good in rails, ftructural steel and
t-ther heavy products. T~" pig Iron market Is
1.-EprovlnE and shows s\gr.s of general revival.
"Money on call continues easy In New Tork
- end London. No permanent stiffening of
tnorey rates Is likely over the summer. ' From
the further decline In foreign exchange It be-
Flss to lock as though the customary summer
exports of g-old to Europe would be email in
volume.

COMMISSIONERS BEGIN THE
TRIAL. \u25a0 OF OFFICER KRAMER
Profound questions of law that promise
to make the '/'case' 'famous among the
many marking disagreements ' between
employers and employes are involved in
the contempt proceedings instituted by
the Seattle Malting and Brewing Com
pany against the. San Francisco- Labor
Council and the allied unions of brewery
workers. The citation for contempt came
up for hearing before Judge Murasky
yesterday, but as the time of the court
was limited, only a bare outline : of ' the
case was made before an adjournment
until- July' 6 was taken. . V
When the \u25a0 case was called' Attorney
Bush Finnell, / representing the plaintiff
corporation, offered to read affidavits set
ting forth the facts' of 'alleged violations
of the injunction that 'have \u25a0 occurred
since the issuance..of the. citation for, con
tempt. Attorney Cameron Hi \King, rep
resenting one ofy> the/ defendant unions,
objecfed to 'the reading/ of additional af
fidavits, f-r, ' -,\u25a0/'\u25a0'.;.- " ;.'â¢
I NO TIME FOR' DEFENSE.
"This Is a quasircrlmlnar proceeding,"
he said, "and the'- respondents here can
not be called upon to defend themselves
against allegations" not contained in the
original .order to -show- cause, jas they
have had no time in which to prepare a
defense to them." ' ;
Judge Murasky sustained the objection,
reserving to the plaintiff, however, the
right to present oral proof in support of
the citation, should it be held . that such
action would avail. Â£}";?;Â»
Attorney Emil Liess, representing an
other of the defendant unions, demurred
to the citation on the ground that it .does
not contain facts sufficient to constitute
contempt.
"There is nothing in this citation," said
Attorney Liess, "that in any way estab
lishes the contention of the plaintiff that
a contempt has been committed. It is
vaguely set forth that certain persons
believed to be members of the defendant
unions have committed acts that ..con
stitute contempt of court. As this is "a
quasi-criminal proceeding, there must be
no room for doubt; the person must be
known to be a member of the union and
it must be shown that he had knowledge
of the injunction. Upon mere belief no
man can be punished."
"The point I want to raise," said At
torney John H. Marble, who represents
William J. French, president of the' La;
bor Council, "is that the wrongful act
of one member of a union, proof being
lacking that such member.'. was apprised
of the issuance of the ' injunction, does
not constitute a contempt for which the
entire organization can . be held respon
sible. . '\u25a0 \u25a0 :';, , ' /;:. ;// ' ,' \u25a0/;\u25a0': , :
AMjEGBS COXSPIRACY.
. "It is our contention, and 1. i think we
have ample authority to establish our
position, that: the organization cannot be
held responsible, for it would.be great in
justice to hold thousands of men guilty
of an act committed by one irresponsible
person." . .' â¢ '\u25a0'\u25a0- I â¢
â¢"But you forget," said Attorney Fin
ne!J, "that it is our contention that the
acts herein complained ; of were commit
ted under. ; authorization of -what we con
tend to be a conspiracy upon the part of
the defendant organizationsâ a conspiracy
I believe that is well established by. the
resolution passed by the Labor Council
condemning the courts of this city for en
joining* the acts we contend are illegal.
Th*is.will be our position. when the case
proceeds for further ..hearing." ." v

carpenter, Mr. Simpson, took Eugene" into
his *_\u25a0 home and cared for ; him until \u25a0 five
days ago,* when the angel of [ death ! again
cas t ; a : shadow across Eugene's j path and
