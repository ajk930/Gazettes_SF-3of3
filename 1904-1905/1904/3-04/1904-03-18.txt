PINGYANG, March 17.â There is lit
tle doubt, according to Russian sources
of information, that the operations in
this neighborhood . are meager and
practically worthless, where the Jap
anese have the advantage of facility
of disguise, rendering impossible much
investigation. Thus at Songchin re
cently a numerous party of Russian
scouts actually spent the. night in the
same" house with five Japanese troopers
disguised as Koreans, suspecting noth
ing. ,
All bodies of Russians now seen are
accompanied by Kcrrean arid Chinese
guides. The former are untrustworthy,
because they are so afraid of the Rus
sians that they will give, false infor
mation to persuade them to depart.

PINGYANG, March 16. â The present extensive land Â¦ move
ments'in Korea are directed toward cutting the communications of
Port Arthur and Vladivostok, which are now considered of. prime
importance. High Japanese officers here. frankly state that there
will be serious fighting on Korean soil only if they are forced to it.
Their army will commence serious work after crossing the Yalu.
The Russian retreat tactics seem to permit this, rendering probable
that the first stand will occur on Manchurian soil. #
Correspondents proceeding north from Pingyang have been
stopped and thus the Japanese are the only ones giving out news.
They state that the Russians have withdrawn to Wiju. Two him- 1
dred and fifty Japanese cavalry have crossed An ju River and sup
ported small columns of infantry. The opposing scouts were occa
sionally in sight at long distances, but rarely clashed.
Recently, near Pacchun, shots ivere exchanged. The Japan
ese were outnumbered and lost one man. Somewhat to the south of
the American mine the Russians started to fortify two passes, but
desisted and withdrew.

Bristow was asked as to how the
committee was to get possession of
certain of the confidential exhibits con
nected with his report. These exhibits
have been kept secret because of their
bearing on pending prosecutions. They
were used in making up the report
touching matter that,jvas submitted to
the House. Bristow told th'e committee
the reports " would be submitted to it
for confidential inspection.
The committee adjourned until Mon
day, when Bristow will resume his tes
timony.
The Question of Bartlett involving
the President was not touched upon
during the executive session of the com
mittee. The two inspectors* reports
marked "Q" and"R" were examined,
as also were a half dozen others. Chair
man McCall said the committee had
begun to realize that the task before
it -was larger than at first anticipated.
WILL SUBMIT EXHIBITS.
"Do I understand the chairman to
suggest that I should not ask that
question?" Inquired Bartlett.
McCall intimated that, without at
tempting to restrain Bartlett, he
thought the question should be consid
ered by the committee In executive ses
sion. He desired the matter left open
until the committee should go into ex
ecutive session.
"I will not pursue it further at pres
ent," concluded Bartlett.
The committee then went into execu
tive 'session.

McCalL V
"It Is entirely outside of the scope
of our investigation," remarked Bur
ton.
"I have very sorrowful news to tell
you. I am here charged with a crime
of which I know absolutely nothing.
The crime is the lynching pf a negro
at Mojave last* Friday night. I swear
by all I love and ' reverence I know
nothing of it. Pray for me."
BAKERSFIELD, March 17.â Slowly
but surely the links in the chain of
evidence in the Mojave lynching are
being.forged by the officers, who from
the beginning have labored constantly
to learn the facts and truth of the
awful affair, j
At the jail last night William Clan
cey, one of the first to be arrested upon
suspicion of being implicated in. the
work of the mob, made a complete con
fession to Sheriff Kelly, telling of his
connection with the case and what
transpired during the affair on Friday
night. Clancey told much the same
story as the men who confessed to Dis
trict Attorney Laird at Mojave Tues
day evening. He said 'that he, with
others, had joined in the movement to
subject the negro, Cummings, to the
indignity of a coat of tar and feathers.
When the jail door was opened Cum
mings ran out of the jail and made
straight for the crowd in an angry and
demonstrative manner. When Cum
mings was a few feet from the prison
Cowan fired a shot in the air, and when
the negro continued advancing a sec
ond shot was fired. Then Cummings
attacked one of the crowd .and a scuf
fle ensued.
Clancey stated that the oil and feath
ers were applied after Cummings was
dead, and the body was then dragged
back into the Jail. In several . letters
which Cowan wrote to friends last
night he stoutly declares his inno
cence. In a letter written to his mother,
Mrs. R. Cowan of St. Johns, N. F., he
says:
Special Dispatch to The Call.
To this Jerome retorted that he was
after a certain member of the Univer
sity Club of New York, who, he aver
red, acted as a "tout" for Canfield.
"Let us understand each other,"
broke in Elsburg. "There is no con
sideration here for Canneld."
"Then why not give me a chance
to prosecute him, to send him to
State's prison?" asked Jerome. "Can
field will not stand trial. He will not
endanger the prominent men who
have patronized his resorts in New
York and Saratoga. Why, he has al
ready offered to plead guilty if he
could get off with a fine or a sus
pended sentence. But we don't pro
pose to let down on him.
"When I find a Legislature not dis
posed to enact a bill to assist me in
prosecuting an ex-convict and gam
bler, it does not conduce to my re
spect for the Legislature. All of us
holding public offices are a little bet
ter off for being watched carefully."
Jerome said he had found obstruc
tions and obstacles placed in his way
from the beginning, but he was deter
mined to pursue Canfield to the end
and to make it plain exactly from
whom he was receiving protection.
Senator Elsburg, chairman of the
committee, remarked that he had re
ceived letters from certain clubmen
protesting against the enacement of
the measure.
ALBANY. N. Y.. March 17. â "I
want to put Richard Canfield in
State's prison, and I want Reginald
Vanderbilt of New York as a witness
to help me do it," declared District
Attorney Jerome of Xew York City
to the Senate Codes Committee to-day
in the course of a hearing on a bill to
make it possible for a witness to give
testimony without having his evi
dence used against him and which
eliminates the excuse of declining to
testify through fear jot incriminating
himself.
NACO, Ariz.', March 17. â Pedro Ayon
and Jose Martinez, two Mexican high
waymen, who entered the Racket store
at Cananea last night, held up the pro
prietor and his clerks and started in to
loot place, are dead as the result of
a gun fight with Mexican gendarmes,
who caught them in the act.
J. H. Hooper, who returned to Naco
this afternoon, brought the news of the
affair. The Racket store is upon the
main street, and the Mexican robbers
entered by a rear door, according to the
story told by Hooper.
Ayon and Martinez were heavily
armed, and the storekeeper . and his
clerks, being taken unawares, lost no
time in holding up their hands, while
the robbers started for the safe and
money drawer. . A citizen on the outside
happened to hear the command of the
desperadoes and quietly informed the
officers. Four of these hurriedly entered
by the front door, leveled their guns at
the heads of the robbers and ordered
them to hold up their hands. Their
command was disregarded by Ayon and
Martinez, who started for the back
door, where they had tied horses to be
used in ma*king their escape. The of
ficers, seeing they were about to lose
their men, opened a deadly fire. Ayon
and Martinez dropped behind some bar
rels in the back of the store and re
turned a fusillade from their repeating
rifles. The officers were as determined
and desperate as the bandits, and when
the smoke cleared away Ayon had been
shot dead and Martinez was mortally
wounded. Martinez died a few hours
later. : v

"Ought not we to inquire Into whose
hands it went?" asked Richardson of
Alabama. . Â¦
"I don't think you ought to ask
that," interrupted Burton, "it was not
within the scope of our investigation."
"Well," broke in Bartlett, "we can
not get the President here, and there
have been hints in the newspapers
about this."
"Have you ever had any conversation
with the President that would lead you
to believe so?" asked Bartlett.
TRYING TO TRACE REPORT.
â¢"I don't know. I have been told, but
1 have no knowledge of it," answered
Uristow. --:;Â¦Â¦Â» s
"Do you know whether or not this
report came directly from the hands of
the Postmaster General without going
into some one else's hands for inspec
tion or perusal before it was sent to
the Postoffice Committee of the
House?"' aeked Bartlett.
"I had nothing further personally
to do with the matter," continued Bris
tow. "I am Informed that the Post
master General asked that the office
of the Fourth Assistant Postmaster
General prepare the information asked
for, and that it was prepared by in
spectors and tutned over to the Post
master General by the chief inspector."
The night of January 25, Bristow
eaid, he was taken sick with the â¢ grip
and he had been unable to be in his
office until last Monday, March 14.
The first information referred to is
that concerning the lease cases of
Representatives Wadsworth of New
Tork, Lilly of Connecticut and Bower-
Eock of Kansas. The second letter re
cited that there were a number of
caBes where "illegal and Improper al
lowances were made," and that It
would require time to make a compila
tion. Â¦ It also stated that there were
many cases where the rents of postof
flces had been increased over the
amount called for In the leases.
In answer to this Overstreet wrote
the Postmaster General asking for ad
ditional information.
DID NOT PREPARE REPORT.
The clerk hire section, he said, was
prepared in the office of the First As
sistant Postmaster General, and that
part relating to leases by inspectors
and others In his own department.
BriEtow's testimony threw much
light on all phases of the inquiry. He
practically cleared members of Con
gress from wrongdoing: touching the
clerk hire section of the report by
Etating that it was the duty of the
First Assistant's office to ascertain the
condition of the work in an office where
en increase had been recommended.
Bristow was asked how the special
report was made up. In reply he said
that on January 22 of this year the
Postmaster General referred to him
the letter from Overstreet which ap
pears in the report. He personally pre
pared the statement contained on pages
4 and 5 and transmitted it to Over-
Etreet with the letter appearing on
pap es â¬ and 7, which was sent by mes
cenger on the forenoon of January 25.

"Hats off to Mandelstamm, twice de

march to the icy plains, the convicts,
almost without food owing to the em
bezzlement of a commissary officer,
complained to the commander of the
escort, who, lining them. up, said: 'Who
objects?' One man stepped forward,
and the officer shot him. Turning pleas
antly to the others the commander In
quired: 'Has any one efse a wish?' A
second man stepped out of the line, and
the commander shot 1.1m dead and
again asked if any one complained.
Mandelstamm said: 'Yes; I do.' The of
ficer, overcome by this fearlessness,
listened to the protest, and supplied the
convicts with food. This was the cour
age of the despised Russian Jew."

-United States Embassador Choate,
the other Embassadors and Ministers
and many peers and members of .the
House of Commons called at Gloucester
House in the course of the afternoon.
The King and Queen went to Gloucester
House this afternoon to offer their per

Duke. -
. It is not generally known to the pres
ent generation that the Duke of Cam
bridge's wife was a burlesque actress
and dancer named Farebrother. She
was very well known in 1840 or there
abouts, and made a great sensation
playing in burlesque at the Lyceum
Theater. She died in 1890. Neither the
peerage nor other reference books men
tion her marriage, which was not rec
ognized officially by Queen Victoria, al
though the latter visited Mrs. ,Fitz

The death of the Duke of Cambridge
necessitates the postponement or can

court will go Into, mourning for several
weeks, and the programme for the
whole London season will have to be
revised.
The title of the Duke of Cambridge
died with the late Duke, his sons being
born . of a morganatic marriage. His
death also places at the disposal of the
King a field marshal's baton, as well as
an order of the Garter.

f LONDON,.; March. 17.â The. Duke, of
Cambridge died at' 10:35 1 o'clock this
morning. ; He was a cousin of the late
Queen Victoria. He was born March
26, 1819. \'
The Duke died peacefully at Glouces
ter House, his Georgian residence on
Park lane. He had been confined to ,hi8
house for some weeks, but until com
pelled to take to his bed he was, as had
been his custom, a constant attendant
at functions of a national or charitable
character.
. When it was announced a month ago
that the Duke was obliged to forego
his annual visit to the south of France
it was recognized that his chances of
recovery were slight. King Edward and
Queen Alexandra had been constant
visitors to the sickroom, while the
Duke's sons, Admiral and Colonel Fltz
george, were almost incessantly at his
bedside.

SACRAMENTO. March 17.â Milo A.
Burke, one of Sacramento's oldest and
wealthiest citizens, is dead at the age
of 76 years. He came to California in
1849 and mined for a time. During the
construction of. the Central Pacific Rail
road >over the mountains he was a
member of the firm of Sisson, Crocker
& Co., which furnished all the supplies
to the company. The firm was after

NEW YORK, March 17.â Failure of
the project to establish a day nur
sery at the St. Louis exposition Is
likely to lead, says the Herald, to the
resignation of Miss Helen Oould from
the' board of lady managers. Miss
Gould was chairman of the day nur
sery committee and, it is understood,
consented to serve largely because of
her interest in that particular project.
ST. LOUIS, March 17. â The board
of lady managers of the World's Fair
has received no intimation of the in
tention of Miss Ho!en Gould to resign,
as rumored, because of the abandon
ment of the plans, for a day nursery
in which Miss Gould was particularly
interested. Misa Lavina Egan. secre

From present' appearances, it is prob
able that taking of testimony will not
begin before Monday morning, as Judge
Cook declines to hold a session on Sat
urday. . . *--;
During the hour of adjournment Dun
ning and Byington had a consultation
lasting nearly an hour, participated in
by Detective Â¦"McVey" of Wilmington.
Del., and Dr. Downs and Wolfe of
Dover. At the conclusion the twelve
Eastern witnesses returned to the Oc
cidental Hotel, where they are stop
ping. :
The . twelve witnesses who arrived
from the East Wednesday night were
all in the District Attorney's office dur
ing the morning. None of them came
into the courtroom until just before the
adjournment of the "morning session,
when Dr. P. S. Down*; Joshua D..Deanc
and Harry C. Pennlngton pushed their
way through the crowded aisle H and
walked over to where Byington was
standing. They chatted for awhile and
then returned with â¢ him to. his 'office.
John P. Dunning, husband of the mur
dered woman, kept studiously but of
eight, as did the women of the party.
Mrs. Botkin was much less contained
than on the previous day. For the
most part she sat leaning heavily with
her elbows on the table in front of her
ar.d - her face buried in a handkerchief.
Occasionally when the District Attor
ney would pronounce the word "mur
der" her shoulders would heave con
vulsively, but no sound came from her
lips. At the end of the examination of
talesmen the strain upon her relaxed
and she spoke in a low tone to her
Eister beside her without any appear
ance of excitement.
Judge Cook ended the discussion by
ordering the box brought in and froiT.
It one hundred names were -drawn.
They, were given to the Sheriff and are
returnable at 10:30 o'clock this morn
ing. Â¦ . Â¦ i y
DEFENDANT NERVOUS.
The venire was exhausted during the
afternoon session and another one was
Issued for one hundred talesmen. Dis
trict Attorney Byington made the sug
gestion that the Sheriff be empowered
to go out and select the talesmen with
out the formality of drawing the names
from the box, as in that way he could
summon them more quickly and the
examination could be continued during
the afternoon. Judge Cook looked
favorably on the suggestion, but At
torney Knight would have none of it.
During the discussion something of r.
tilt ensued between Byington and
Knight. Knight said that drawing
from the box was the regular method
of summoning talesmen and he insisted
that it be continued.
Only two others escaped challenges
for cause and dismissals. One was J.
E. Collins, who conducts a grocery store
at 221 Point Lobos avenue. He an
swered all questions satisfactorily and
was passed, but for some reason wa3
peremptorily challenged by the prose
cution. The other was Benjamin G.
Eldridge of 1424 Broderick street, who
started out with an opinion, but con
cluded he could discard it and return
a verdict strictly in accordance with
the evidence as adduced at the trial.
Attorney Knight" was skeptical and
used up one of his fast-diminishing
peremptories in dismissing the tales
man. At present the defense has four
peremptories left SQtlsLhffl prosecution
five.
A spirited discussion was heal be
tween Mrs. Botkin and Attorney*
Knight and McGowan as to the 'ad
visability of accepting O'Connor as t\
juror. Mrs. Botkin seemed to favor
him and at length, to the relief of all
the officers of the court, the defense an
nounced its willingness to allow O'Con
nor to act as one of the panel. He is
the tenth juror chosen so far. f
TWO PEREMPTOIUES.
He was in Alaska at the time of the
first trial and consequently Ignorant of
the . proceedings at that time. Since
then he has read nothing further of
the case beyond the fact that witnesses
on behalf of the prosecution were ex
pected to arrive from the East. Attor
ney Knight, who has been opposing
counsel in some litigation in which
O'Connor- was involved, asked him
pointedly whether or not he harbcred
eny resentment against him on that
account, to which the talesman replied
in the negative.
Out of forty-three talesmen exam
ined in Judge Cook's court yesterday
on the retrial of Cordelia Botkin,
charged with the murder of Mrs. Eliz
abeth Dunning by sending her from
this city to Dover, Del., a boz of
poisoned candy, of Which she partook
and from the effects of which she aied.
only one man answered satisfactorily
the interrogatories propounded by Dis
trict Attorney Byington and Georg-i A.
Knight, attorney for the defendant.
He is William M. O'Connor, a capital
ist, and resides at the St. Dunscan
Hotel on the corner of Van Ne3s ave
nue and Sutter street.
SACRAMENTO, March 17. â The
lockout of unions connected with the
building trades continues and both
sides appear prepared for a long and
hard-fought contest, although there is
an element working quietly for an early
and peaceful settlement. President
Scott F. Ennis of the Citizens' Alliance
said to-day that the alliance has grown
in two- days from 150 to 850 members,
and that in a few weeks Tt will number
1500 employers of labor and their sym
pathizers. He said the alliance would
shortly establish permanent offices and
would have a staff of eight lawyers to
look out for whatever litigation may
arise. The unions, on the other hand,
maintain that they are in a position to
continue their fight without work for
five years, if necessary.
It is generally recognized that a
speedy settlement of the troubles la
necessary, in order that the material
interests of the city may not suffer.
The indications had all pointed to this
being an unusually prosperous year for
the builders, as many business houses
and homes have been contracted for,
but all work on them must cease pend
ing a settlement. President Ennis de
clares that from now on Sacramento
shall be an "open shop" town, and that
while no discrimination will be made
against union men they must consent
to work alongside non-union men. Both
factions .are confident of success, and
the developments of the next few days
are anxiously awaited by those having
building improvements under way.

After the failure of the bank and

Commander Sewell leaves three
young daughters, a father in UnadHla,
N. Y.; a sister. Mrs. George A. Kent of
Binghamton, N. Y., and a brother,
Judge Sewell. His wife died some four
years ago from a similar complaint
contracted, It is thought, while Com
mander Sewell was on duty In Japan.
The funeral services will be held at
the navy yard on Saturday and the
remains will be accorded the full hon
ors due a military governor. The body
will be sent East for interment.
Commander Sewell was born in No
vember, 1851. He entered the Naval
Academy September 26, 1867, grad
uating with the class of 1871. He
wag well known in this city, having
been attached to the navy yard at
various times. Some years ago he
was married at Mare Island to a
daughter of Commodore Moore, then
6n duty at the yard. He became Gov
ernor'of Guam August 1. 1903, serv
ing in that capacity until his last ill
ness. ''
. During the Spnnish War* Command
er Sewell was the executive officer of
the dynamite cruiser Vesuvius. He
reached the grade of commander in
January, 1902, and In the following-
July was placed in command of the
United States ship Supply and went in
that vessel to Guam, where he served
as naval Governor until his return to
the United States.

mornlnir at the Naval Hospital. His
death was not entirely unexpected.
His brother, Justice A. H. Sewell of
New York, and his father-la-'.aw,
Commander Moore, retired, were with
him at the last.
Commander Sewell had been a suf
ferer from' an abscess of the liver in
a very. rare form, brought on, It Is
relieved,*. by many years of service off
and on In the tropics. He had suf
fered from the disease for years. In
December last Commander Sewell was
placed upon the sick list and his con
dition was so serious during the home
ward trip from Guam that it Atas be
lieved he would not reach this port
alive. Immediately upon his arrival
here he seemed to improve.' Ten days
ago the attending physicians stated
that the case, while serious, was not
necessarily fatal. Several operations
were performed to give him tempo
rary relief and a few days ago his
condition was so favorable that the
physicians stated that if he could only
hold his own for a week he would
have a fighting chance for life.
Wednesday he lapsed into uncon
sciousness and late that afternoon
was sinking bo rapidly that his three
little daughters were summoned to his
bedside.

ST. PETERSBURG. March 17. â
Russian preoccupation in the Far East
has in a way given surcease to bureau
cratic cruelty.
Fifty-seven men and women are
about to be deported to the coldest
part of Northeastern Siberia, Yakutsk
province. Among the fifty-seven are
persons from all the provinces and
representatives of almost eve.ry na
tionality In Russia. Great Russians,
little Russians, Poles, Jews and
Georgians are on the list, and all social
classes, Including the nobility, are
represented. Their terms of deporta
tion vary from three to six years. The
charge against them is taking part in
the riotous strikes that resulted In
bloodshed.
Bean was appointed to West Point
from Pennsylvania in 1882. He served
with the Second United States Cavalry
during the Spanish war, and was pro
moted to a captaincy for gallant ser
vices in the Cuban campaign. He also
served with General Chaffee during the
e:ege and capture of Peking, and was
arain promoted for meritorious ser
vices.
OMAHA, March 17.â Major William
H. Bean, U. S. A., committed suicide
to-day by shooting himself through the
head. He had been ordered to the Phil
ippines. Immediately after getting his
orders he had his trunks packed and
taken to the depot. Then he asked his
wife to play on the piano, and while
she was playing he thrust an army re
volver to his right temple and flred.
The buliet lodged in his brain and he
died almost immediately.
Major Bean was 50 years old. He had
been chief commissary officer at the
headquarters of the Department of the
Misscyjrl for two years, and was re
lieved of that duty a few days ago and
ordered to the Philippines. At army
headquarters it was stated that he had
I Â«Â»en suffering from an attack of stom
ach troub'e and nervousness. His act
â¢was apparently unpremeditated. He
had arranged for Mrs. Bean to visit in
the East during the time he served in
the Orient.
CHICAGO, March 17.â Edwrd Ker
lin, alias Edward Pierce, charged with
forgery and robbing mall boxes, has
been identified as the man who assist
ed Fred Lee Rice, Frank Rutledge and
Thomas Jones in an attempt to escape
from custody in Toronto on April 4,

Canada and tried and sentenced to
twenty-one years' Imprisonment.
Kerlin was identified by a photograph
eent out by the Canadian authorities.
Chester Sheldon, who was released with
Kerlin from the Joliet Penitentiary,
recognized the likeness. He told the de
tectives Kerlin was In Canada at the
time of the attempted escape. When
the three prisoners, after their capture
In Chicago, were being taken from the
police station, three women â Allie
Hoeny, Viney Elwell and Kate Spell

. Williams warmly replied that there
never was a man born so great a fool
Grosvenor of Ohio, speaking in a sar
castic vein, said that great bureaus of
the Postoffice Department had been
transferred to the Fourth Assistant
Postmaster General, and he thought it
would be a good Idea to let Bristow
"run the whole machine" and thereby
save the salaries of the other three as
sistants.
The charge that- the Postoffice De
partment had diverted appropriations
for rent, fuel, etc., to the payment of
clerk hire was, vigorously made by
Williams, and he demanded to know
who was responsible for that abuse and
for changing the law to suit his own
will.
"Somebody," he said, "has been de
priving the legislative branch of the
Government of its constitutional right
and power to say where the , public
money shall go."
Overstreet said there was a belief In
the department that the construction
of the appropriation would permit the
practice.
VIOLATE THE IiAW.
Payne said he did not believe any
thing of the kind, and he had not seen
a single man who knew anything about
it.
"And still." he said, "the gentleman
indulges in this extravagant language
that the whole department is rotten."
Williams then withdrew all the points
of order and amendments he had of
fered.
"I believe, and I believe the gentle
man from New York believes, that
there are other divisions In it equally
corrupt"
GROSVENOR IS SARCASTIC.
Cowherd of Missouri and Overstreet
argued for a retention of the 52700 sal
ary provision on the ground that the
salary of men performing such duties
should not be too meager. Williams
insisted that there ought not to be an
attempt to reorganize the Postoftlce
Department in an appropriation bill.
If it is to be reorganized it should be
done in a definite and specific way.
Williams included in his objection
cashiers, whose salaries he was op
posed to raising, and offered an amend
ment to reduce the amount allowed t>y
the bill. Further criticizing the pro
posed increases in salaries Williams, as
If by way of emphasis, remarked "this
is a department that is absolutely rot
ten from turret to foundation-stone."
Payne of New York, the Republican
leader, asked. "Where dqes the gentle
man get this information?"
"I get it from their own office," re
plied Williams.
"Then you do not get it at all," hotly
replied Payne.
"I do," warmly replied Williams,
"and I get it from their charges
against themselves; and I get it from
the charge contained In the President's
message; and. I get it from the knowl
edge that prevails in this House." He
said that only one division of the Post
office Department had been investi
gated.
OBJECTS TO SALARIES.
Williams followed this up by making
a point O f order against the proposi
tion to give stamp clerks who may be
assigned as "chiefs" $2700, as against
$1700, which they now receive.
Williams made a point of order
against the provision in the bill des
ignating certain postal employes a&
"cashiers," "night superintendents."
"superintendents of carriers." "super
intendents of inquiry," etc. He said
that it was simply a means of putting
favorites into places of salaries higher
than they already received.
After an extended debate the point
of order was sustained.
Overstreet said the administration
estimate of $7000 had been reduced by
the committee and the amount would
be used almost exclusively in advertis
ing for bids.
After some discussion by Thayer of
Massachusetts, Rider of New York
and Stephens of Texas the provision
was agreed to.
Cromer of Indiana wanted the ap
propriation of $7500 for compensation
and expenses of United States dele
gates to the Universal Postal Congress
at Rome reduced to 55000. The differ
ence in the amounts, he said, was in
tended to pay the expenses to Rome
of a former member of the House,
referring to former Congressman
Loud, "whose voice," he said, "always
had been raised in the interest of
economy."
After a lively debate the amendment
was agreed to by a vote by tellers of
SS to 75.
Tawney of Minnesota asserted that
the Democrats in the Fifty-first Con
gress voted against anti-trust legisla
tion, but a vigorous protest came from
Gaines of Tennessee and Williams,
each of whom asserted that the Demo
crats unanimously voted for such legis
lation.
Soon after convening to-day the
House went Into committee of the
whole to further consider the post
office appropriation bill, which was
read for amendment.
Maddox of Georgia requested of
Overstreet, chairman of the Postofflce
Committee, an explanation of an item
of *5000^for advertising, saying:
"As it*has been said there are a lot
of rascals in the department who will
probably be a little more particular
hereafter."
MAKES POINT OF ORDER.
WASHINGTON, March 17.â Just
before adjournment to-day Southwlck
of New York precipitated a brief but
lively debate by having read an edi
torial from the New York World giv
ing Republicans credit for anti-trust
legislation and the merger prosecution.
It was offered by way of reply to Wil
liams, who yesterday asked if the
merger decision was to be used by the
Republicans as a theatrical political
trick. Williams, after the editorial
had been read, declared . that the se
curities prosecution was instigated by
Governor Van Sant of Minnesota,
whom he styled "a blanket Indian Re
publican," who refused to consult
"headquarters," and that for very
shame after he had the case docketed
the administration prior to an election
could not hold itself still.
- Already, he continued, Attorney Gen
eral Knox had been careful to be in
terviewed and to permit the country
to know that the Northern Securities
case Just settled the Northern Securi
ties case, and that it does not mean
anything particular, anyhow. One
statement in the article referred to,
he said, credited this administration
with being the author of the prosecu
tion. It happened to be, he declared,
one Van Sant, out In the West some
where, who started the case, and for
very shame, after he had got the case
upon the docket, the administration,
prior to an election, could not hold
itself still. Governor Van Sant was a
"blanket Indian Republican," and he
did not consult "headquarters," but
precipitated the litigation.
Continuing, Williams said he had
seen blanket Indian Republicans be
fore, and he had seen them "quelled"
when the time came.
"And," he declared, "if you dare to
attack the men who are furnishing
your campaign expenses and carry it
far enoueh to persuade them you are
in earnest, you will be quelled, too. If
you don't do it, you will be quelled by
the people."
Tawney of Minnesota stirred up a
hornet's nest when he inquired of Wil
liams if he could state how the Demo
crats in the Flfty-flrst v Congress voted
when the Sherman law was up for con
sideration. He declared that every del
egate voted against it.
The House was at once in an up
roar.
Gaines of Tennessee, gesticulating
wildly, asserted that every one voted
for the bill when it was passed in the
House and that it passed the House
and Senate unanimously. His remarks
were met by laughter and jeers from
the Republican side. He stated that the
flrst bill had been introduced by Sena
tor Teller and began to give a history
of the legislation, when he was inter
rupted by Tawney, who said' that
when McKinley presented the rule for
the consideration of the anti-trust law
the Democrats opposed it.
"Ah, get out:" shouted Gaines. amid
great confusion. *
An inquiry from Grosvenor as to
what had become of the postofllce ap
propriation partly restored good order.
Mr. Williams, getting the floor, said
it was not true that the Democrats op
posed any legislation calculated Â¦ to
down trusts or combines.
The House at 5:20 o'clock adjourned.
as to contend that an appropriation for
rent meant an appropriation for fuel.
He then spoke of the Independence of
the Civil Service Commission and Its
absolute contempt for the law.
"They do not hesitate a minute," he
declared, "to violate the law any time
they please, and tell you with suavity
that It was because of a construction
put on the law by somebody, God only
knows wha"
He eaid the most discouraging thins
In American citizenship as represented
In the House was for an honest man
to . come to Congress and find him
self hedged all around with, a wilder
ness of misinformation, overlnforma
tlon and non-lnformatlon, "whichever
happens to suit the fellows who write
their decrees and send them here to
be registered In appropriation bills."
' The hour of adjournment was at
hand when Southwlck of New York,
referring to "Williams' remarks yeBter-:
day on the subject of trusts, had read
an editorial from the JCÂ«w York World
saying that the anti-trust law was
framed by a Republican, passed by
a Republican Senate and signed by a
Republican President, and that It had
remained a dead letter on the statute
books during the second term of Presi
dent Cleveland. The Republicans vig
orously applauded.
Williams said he was more than de
lighted to see the Republican majority
on the floor "cheer the hounds on to
hunt down the combines and trusts of
this country."

a lonely life here, following the calling

Death Ends His Exile.
Under date of March 17* the Chefu
correspondent of the Standard reports
that provision trains are arriving hour
ly' at Port Arthur, the railway being
intact. XI: " ' .
The Dally Telegraph's correspondent,
cabling on March 17,' asserts that the
Russian fleet has returned to Port Ar
thur. If this is correct, the correspond
ent adds; it Is evident from Rear Ad
miral Baron von Stackelberg's report
that the Russian cruisers which left
Vladivostok returned to that port with
out an attempt having been made to
unite the fleets, or if an attempt was
made it was unsuccessful.
It is stated that the Russians are
again negotiating for the purchase of
Welsh coal, and it is reported from
Hamburg that Russia is trying to place
contracts with German shipyards .for
several new torpedo-boat destroyers, to
be delivered this year.
According to a dispatch from Ant
werp to the Daily Telegraph, Russia
has acquired twenty large , Antwerp
transport steamships and has insured
them for $250,000 each.
The Daily Mall's Weihaiwel corre
spondent learns that Viscount ,Aokl,
formerly Japanese Minister to Ger
many, is going "to Seoul to establish
practically a Japanese administration
for Korea. x
LONDON, March 18. â The correspond
ent of the Daily Mail at ChefuÂ» who has
just visited Chemulpo, says:
"On the way to Chemulpo we passed
a constant succession of Japanese
transports. Three thousand Japanese
landed at Chemulpo at the end of last
week."
The correspondent adds that the Rus
sians are retreating across the Yalu
River before the advance of the Japa
nese outposts and that their forces in
this district number 20,000.
NEWCHWANO, March 17. â The
patriarchal General Litevltch, who
waa accompanied by General Kov
dratonovitch. after a survey yesterday
of Newchwangr and its defenses, which
had been prepared for his inspection,
returned to his command at Liaoyang.
He also visited Kaichou and points af
fecting the protection of the gulf
coast and the holding of the -weak zone
along. the main line of railway op
posite Newchwang.
Although disclaiming any apprehen
sion of the Japanese landing here, the
authorities are satisfied to have for
eigners understand that the Russians
are prepared for any locaUemergency,
and the arrival of an additional bat
tery of artillery; and also 150 scouts
to-day is significant of coming events.
It. is apparent that both civil and
military strategists and the diplomats
in Mukden apprehend a collision with
the Chinese, probably fearing that the
increasing number of their small bands
of .scouts operating between the Liao
River and the Great Wall are the
surest instruments for their entangle
ment in a conflict, particularly as this
zone is in the nature of a No-Mans
Land, on account of having been aban
doned by the powers and also because
the Chinese jurisdiction is incompe
tent. Russians competent to judge
profess to regard General Ma's atti
tude as dangerous ,to the peace of
Russia and China.
"Despite the terrible weather the in

It was a severe test, but they did well.

Is now disembarking within easier dis
tance of the Japanese objective, while
preparations are reported proceeding
at the only practical port on the east of
Korea. The Japanese are now holding
Anju and the line of the Chengcheng
River.. .
"The actual land front points to a
further retirement of the Russian
forces.
"Despite their command of the sea,
the Japanese omit no precautions. It
would be unfair to the 'Japanese to
give the numbers and designation of

LONDON, March 18.â A correspond
ent of the Times at Tokio says that the
Russian and Japanese scouts are now
separated only by the river Cheng
cheng, Just north of Anju. The dis
patch adds that the foreign corre
spondents will leave for the front on
either March 22 or March 23, but their
destination is still unknown.
A correspondent of the Times at
Welhalwei cables under yesterday's
date:
"I . arrived at Pingyang Inlet on
March 15 and proceeded to Chenampho.
Navigation ( was difficult, owing to the
drift of ice. I found anchored there
both war vessels and transports. Dis
embarkation has been difficult, but the
Japanese have brought all necessary
appliances. Pontoon jetties have been,
built and extended for hundreds of
yards, and the transports brought their
own landing barges."
The correspondent describes the
landing movements and the disposal
of the forces with some detail, and
says:- 1

"The Japanese will be much ham

Invasion by sea. Sea crossings^are al

notoriously the weak point of the Jap

will need In Korea conveyances drawn

The general added that the Rus

WICHITA, Kans.. March 17. âThe
Federal Grand Jury returned sixteen
Indictments to-day. Six of them are
against Kansas City and Kentucky
wholesale liquor dealers, who are
charged with violation of the prohib

is the shipping of liquor by the deal

lowing express agents to dispose of
the packages to whoever wants them.
The names of the dealers against whom
true bills were found were not made
public.
True bills were also found against
Chauncey Dewey, C. P. Dewey, W. J.

KANSAS CITY, Mo., March 17.â
Two months ago three wholesale liquor

SALT LAKE, Utah, March 17.â Some

a United States mail wagon with
orange colors. A large crowd of Irish
men were celebrating St. Patrick's day
on Main street when a mail wagon
came along. The sides and rear were
decorated with orange colored ribbon
and pieces of orange peel. This aroused
the Ire of the Hibernians and a rush
was made for the vehicle. The driver,
unconscious of the cause of the disturb
ance, thought robbery was being at
tempted and yelled for the police. Some
of the cooler heads among the Irishmen
managed to hold the crowd in check
until the arrival of officers. The driver
willingly divested his wagon of the un
popular decorations and was permitted
to go on his way.

SEOUL, March 17. â Although the
cruiser Cincinnati made a special trip
to Chenampho with the express pur
pose of bringing away women, chil
dren and other American residents in
Northwestern Korea, but a small pro
portion of the missionaries in that dis
trict took advantage of the opportuni
ty offered. The majority of the Cin
cinnati's passengers who arrived at
Chemulpo yesterday were from, the
American mining concession. They re
port that while the present danger is
not pressing, the entire district is, dot
ted with advance scouting parties of
both' belligerents arid it is not safe for
women and children; further, .that
as soon as the first large engagement
occurs travel to the coast will be im
possible and escape rendered difficult.
There is a probability that much suf
fering and loss of life will ensue.
There Is strong opinion here that
the missionaries are displaying mis
directed zeal, amounting to foolhardi
ness, by remaining in the face of the
bitter and protracted warfare Â¦which
will surely be waged in proximity to
their- stations. They should at least
send the women and children .away
before it is too late. By prompt ac
tion American Minister Allen placed
the means at their disposal, which
they shortsightedly refused.
Two pro-Russian Koreans, General
Kehak Keun and General Hiusang

SEOUL, March 17.â It is reported by
the prefects of Northeastern Korea that
bodies of Russians, accompanied by in
terpreters, are surveying the country,
ascertaining the population, the quan
tity of supplies and the sentiment of
the people. The proposed Japanese
landing at Wonson, on the eastern
coast, has been delayed by the threat
ening attitude of the Vladivostok naval
squadron, consisting of four ships,
which are now anchored at Posslet
Bay, an excellent base for attacking
Japanese transports approaching Won
son.
The Japanese authorities have been
advised that the Russian cavalry* in
Northern Korea has partly recrossed
the Talu River and that a Cossack
battery also has withdrawn. A small
Russian force still occupies Chongju.
Five thousand engineers are now em
ployed in the building of the military
railroad from Seoul to Wiju. Only a
few miles has been completed. Civil
ians are working on the railroad from
Seoul to Fusan. This road cannot be
completed before next October.
Consul at Shanghai says that the cap
tain of a Norwegian vessel which had
arrived there from Port Arthur re
portjj that the Russian fleet left Port
Arthur on the morning of March 12,
but returned the same evening.
The military authorities. in the Far
East have reported here that there is
absolutely no truth in the story that
Russian .troops are- occupying the
American mining concession at'Unsan;
Korea. They made an investigation,
at the Instigation of the authorities
here, on account of the reports in cir
culation. Â¦ Besides, the Russian Gov
ernment has already-promised, so far
as it lies in Its power, to safeguard
American interests, should the sphere
of operations extend to the American
concessions.
PLEASED BY CHINA'S PLEDGE.
United States Embassador McCor
mlck has communicated to the Gov
ernment the memorandum containing
Â«hiÂ» assurance received iby United
Russia does not regard Korea as a
belligerent and will not do so until
there is evidence that Korea actually
Is making common cause with Japan.
Russia now considers the .Korean
Government as being under duress
and that all its acts are void.
Although no confirmation Is obtain
able of the dispatch from Seoul say
ing that a Korean official in the Tu
men River district had received notice
that Russia considered Korea as a
belligerent and, would act accordingly,
in Government circles it is considered
quite possible that. the Russian com
manders along the Korean border may
have warned the. Koreans that they
must not impede the Russian military
operations, under pain of being con
sidered belligerents. Even should
Korea throw in her -Jot with Japan
and join in the hostilities, Russia
would not deign to regard such an
ally of Japan as a second power within
the terms of the Franco-Russian alli
ance. '-; . .Â¦ ; â¢ >
STATUS OF THE KOREAN'S.
General Kuropatkin will live on a
train with his staff and be prepared
to move to any point where his pres
ence is required. If the Japanese land
in force on the coast of Northern Ko
rea, General Kuropatkin will move his
hadquarters farther north, along the
railroad. If there is fighting along
the Talu, which now seems " probable,
he will go forward to Fungwangcheng.
Great precautions are being taken to
guard against surprises. The Japan
ese have always shown a preference
for night attacks and most rigorous
orders have been issued to keep up a
continuous advance of scouting par
ties and to have heavy pickets out at
night.
General Kuropatkin is now near
Omsk,, Siberia. He is making very
fast time, averaging mor.e than 532
miles per day, everything being side
tracked to get him to Mukden on
March 26, the only stops, except to
change engines, being occasionally to
inspect passing troop trains.
While the Russians are mobilizing
for the purpose of working out an of
fensive military problem, they will be
prepared to move heavy forces In any
direction to meet the Japanese, whose
command of the sea gives them great
freedom in selecting their points of
attack.
The Bret headquarters of the Man
churi&n army after General Kuropat
kin's arrival will be at Liaoyang, the
general having selected that point In
stead of Mukden, whence to direct the
operations. Liaoyang is ten miles
west of the railroad, being connected
with the main road by a special line,
which will be completed by the time
General Kuropatkin arrives and has
many advantages over Mukden, being
the point whence the telegraph line
and the "Peking road" go to the Yalu
River.
Another road, not marked on the
maps, leads almost due east to an ex
tinct volcano. Paiktou San, or Long
White Mountain, in whose crater Is
a sacred lake. The road was built by
the Chinese, whose Emperors former
ly went there to shoot tigers, with
which the region is infested. Two
rivers, the Tumen and the Talu, rise
near the mountain. Liaoyang, conse
quently, commands both roads over
which troops will be sent, according
to necessity. Laioyang also has the
advantage of being nearer to the fron
tier of China in the event of punitive
measures being required against the
Chinese. It also is close to Llaotung
Peninsula, Newchwang and the mouth
of the Liaoho.
JAPAN' HAS ADVANTAGE.

"The accusation against the Japan
ese of using explosives to produce pois

tion. They are employing the same
explosives as other armies and navies.
It is notorious that the bursting of a
melinite shell between decks generates
fumes from which the men are liable
to asphyxiation, but the Russian shell
is no better and no worse than that
used by the Japanese. We have not

ST. PETERSBURG, March 17.â The
charge against the Japanese of violat

naval officer, who holds a very respon

"We are well aware," eaid a member
of the legation, "that the eyes of other
powers are watching our every move
ment, and we know also what Is being
said about a general uprising against
foreigners should we take sides with
Japan; but there will be* no chance
whatever for our giving the slightest
ground for complaint. China can only
play one role during the war, namely,
that of absolute quiescence. I will not
deny that there is some pro-Japanese
feeling among my countrymen, but
there Is also a good deal of pro-Russian
feeling. One neutralizes the other. -
"I know nothing officially," he con
tinued, "concerning China's new neu
trality understanding with the United
States, but the reports are doubtless
correct. We are not carrying on nego
tiations with the Russian Government
but I believe that some matters
are being discussed at Peking. I see
no reastih why the fullest agreement
should^ not be reached with Russia.
Our position is a very clear one. We
have 20,000 men guarding our frontier
of Manchuria. This force Is- Intended
solely to maintain order and to prevent
either of the belligerents entering our
territory.. The talk of the foreign
newspapers about General Ma making
common cause with the Japanese is
nonsense. Should the Japanese at
tempt a landing on â¢ our coast they
would be resisted."
The Chinese legation here has as-,
sured the press most positively that the
Government at Peking intends not only
to observe the strictest neutrality dur
ing the war between Russia and Japan,
but that the Government thoroughly
realizes the danger threatening the in
tegrity of the Celestial Empire In case
it should become embroiled in the con
flict.

they have any intention of going west

cruiser Vlcksburg offered succor to the
Russians.
The Bourse Gazette says Japan's
hope of aid from America is gone, and
she now looks only to China. With
the latter's hatred of the West in
view, she is trying her best to effect
an alliance. The Gazette predicts that
Chinese neutrality will soon be broken.

SUMMARY OF* THE DAY'S WAR NEWS.
A wnr correspondent of The Call' has completed a cross-country trip from Seoul to ringyang, the
Japanese base of operations In Northwestern Korea. He reports that the Japanese commanders expect
the Russians to fall back across the Yalu River, making their final stand on the Manchurian side. The
advance of the brown men, he says, has been admirably planned and Is progressing; very leisurely, the
. strength of the men being wived for the hard work ahead of them. Contrary to his expectation, he found
that -the sentiment of the. native Koreans was favorable to the Russian cause. So far has the Japanese ad
vance progressed that their scouts are separated from those of the Russian army only by the river Cheng
cheng, north of Anjou.
Russia's Vladivostok squadron, which Admiral Kamimura failed to entrap when he made his recent
dash to the Siberian harbor, Is again annoying the Toldo war board. After the departure of Kamimura
the four cruisers evidently left the- harbor and they are now at Posslet Bay, on the northeastern coast of
Korea, lying in -wait for the army Japan Is attempting to land there. It was here that the Japanese
admiral expected to find them when he attempted his recent coup, but they had been warned In time to
retreat to the shelter of the Vladivostok forts. . â¢
Port Arthur again rei>orts "all quiet." A dispatch from Chefu says It Is learned there that a Rus
sian torpedo-boat destroyer was sunk at Port Arthur by accidental contact with a mine, only four of' her
. crew being saved. Viceroy AlexlefT denies that great damage was done by Japanese shells during the re
cent bombardment. He says the Port Arthur fleet has cruised i within a radius of fifty miles of the harbor
without sighting the Japanese warships.
General Kuropat kin's special train Is making rapid progress through Siberia. Once at the scene of
hostilities the commander In chief will live aboard the train, making his headquarters wherever his pres
ence Is needed most.
American missionaries In Northern Korea have failed to heed the, warning to escape from the war
district while they have the opportunity. Few availed themselves of the chance to depart on the Ameri
can cruiser Cincinnati. In the Korean capital It Is feared that their f oolhardlness may yet be repented
and they are censured for not sending the women and children to places of safety. It was announced by
the State Department early this week that hereafter It would be impossible to send navnl or military ex- \
pedltions into the war district to rescue endangered missionaries.
Russian officials discredit the reports that the Japanese are using explosives prohibited by The
Hague convention. They have no complaint to -make against Japanese procedure since the formal declaration
of war.
It Is the belief in St. Petersburg that the war will last about a year and a half, and arrangements
are being mode on that basis. â¢ Â¦
The suggestion that . Russia win attempt to send the Baltic fleet to the Far East by the Arctic route
~* is being widely discussed by European naval experts. Should the project be successful the most remark
able cruise of a fleet on record will have been made.

are in the way of any one who wishes
to go in and enjoy camp life.. Portions

of Mhe ; early opening of the season
the Commissioners have authorized
the warden to construct a log cabin

; Yonns Armenian Receives Strong
Support in His Snit to Recover
Wages From Rug Dealer.
The suit of Thomas Killogean. an
Armenian, against M. B. Mihran. the
Turkish rug dealv at 205 Post street,
for ?1700 he alleges is due for wages
for two years' work as a salesman in
j Mihran's store, was on trial in Judge
I Hebbard's court yesterday. Mihran
opposes the suit on the ground that
the plaintiff was not a salesman in
his store, but pimply a porter and jan
itor. The evidence adduced yesterday,
however, showed- that the plaintiff had
for a number of months sold rugs.
Evidence to this effect was given by
Charles Crocker, R. Weil, Mrs. Be
lasco and Mrs. Louis Sloss, all of
whom said they had been sold ruga by
Killogean. They also gave evidence
favorable to his reputation in general.
A few days ago Killogean was ar
rested on a warrant sworn to by Mih
ran. charging him with stealing a rug
and selling it to Mrs. Curtis. After
a trial in the Police Court Killogean
was discharged, Mihran failing to
sustain his charges.

BERLIN. March 17.â Herr Bebel. the
Socialist leader, speaking in the Reich
stag to-day during the debate on the
supplementary appropriation tor Ger
man Southwest Africa, said the whites
teemed to him to be primarily respon
sible for the insurrection of the Her
reros. The traders, he asserted, per
suaded the natives to buy on credit
articles which they did not require in
their mode of living and charged 600
per cent over the actual value of the
goods. Thus the natives were deep in
debt and their burdens were increas
ing; year by year.
The Colonial Office in 1903. in order
to J<?ss-en the traders' exactions, ruled
that debts of certain kinds due to trad
Â«?is were r.ot collectable after one year,
and the traders proceeded to force the
collection by taking cattle at ridicu
lously low valuations. This ruling, in
tended to protect the natives, immedi
acy multiplied the differences about
the debts. The Herreros saw them
eeiv<?s ruined and rebelled.
Dr. Stcubel. director of the Colonial
Oflice, said that from the information
received so far it was impossible lo
draw a final conclusion as to the cauÂ«
of the uprising:. Some colonials as

from so diverting the water..
By the decision" the defendant is"

The toast was all the more sensa

principal guest at the banquet! In say
ing that he dare riot talk because he
was a soldier he added that every offi
cer of the army, especially from the
Philippines, who had talked publicly
"has heard from Washington."
CHICAGO. March 17.â General Fred
D. Grant, commander of the Â¦ Depart
ment of the Lakes./startled the Irish
Fellowship Society at its banquet to
night by snubbing the President of the
United States in the toast assigned to
him. j General Grant was asked to re
spond to the toast, "The President."
Instead of the good words that were
expected his fellow banqueters heard
the following:
"I can only say a few words to you
to-night. In the first place, I am not
a speechmaker. In the second place,
because I am a soldier the ban of
silence rests upon me. In the third
place, I do not know the President of
the United States."
With these sententious remarks, Gen
eral. Grant abruptly dismissed the sub
ject assigned to him, and there was an
awkward silence until the toastmaster
came to the rescue with the next toast
on the programme.

"The execution of this great design,"
it says, "is not unaccompanied by im

on leaving the Baltic Sea consists of
rounding the coast of Norway, pass

fleet in some measure must skirt the
eternal Icefields of the pole, finding on
Its way Nova Zembla, the isle of soli

"At this point of Its voyage, assum
ing that it accomplishes it without
hindrance, the Russian fleet will find
itseff in Bering Sea and the waters of
Kamchatka.
"Now, for reaching this region, every
part of the route along the whole .line
of itinerary which has just been indi

eightieth degree of latitude. The cold
there during the ten good months of
the year is from 20 to 40 degrees and

Zembla and Greenland, and cm the oth

Strait.
"These three routes are encumbered
by icepacks formed In the Polar Sea.
The Xordenskjold passed through these
regions in 1897 and attained as high
a latitude as 81 degrees 42 minutes'. It
la not necessary for the Russian fleet
to go so high in the north. It is only
a question of its finding a free expanse
of water to enable it to arrive at Ber

ly a continuous belt between the ex
treme coast of Arctic Asia and Amer
ica, along the shores of Alaska.
"This point of the globe, where" the
Nordenskjojd and Peary have won
fame, became tragically, known in 18S1
by the disaster to the Jeannette in the
Arctic expedition sent out by the New
York Herald under Lieutenant de Long.
The Jeannette entered the Polar Sea at
the north of Bering Strait and disap
peared there. She had scarcely passed
out of the channel when she was seized
by an iceberg and during two win
ters, fastened to an icefloe, was car
ried across the glacial* sea to sink at
last off the New Siberian islands, bar
red in by masses of great icepacks to
which the Jeannette could offer no re
sistance.
"If this bold voyage is accomplished
It will certainly be the first time in
the world's history' when the polar bear
and seals will have the pleasure and
surprise of 'seeing a fleet pass in file
before them."

of colonists who entered the State by
way of Ogden, El Paso and Portland,
was 4023, as against 3725 for the sam*.
period last year. Between March 8
and 14 there passed Ogden 1252 col
onists, which is also an over
the same week last year. The recent
statements made by Passenger Traffic
Manager McCormick of the Southern
Pacific Company to the effect that the
latter part of the yjear will witness, the
greater number of colonists coming
westward is being already supported
by the numerous inquiries made at tho
company's offices in the East relative
to travel during that time of the year.
According to the latest figures given
out by the Southern Pacific Company
the colonist traffic this year is well
within the expectations of the officials
of the road and from reports received
from various Eastern points it will
eventually surpass the record of last
year.

Mare comes of an interesting family
and there is a glamour of romance
about the doings of his immediate an
cestors. His father is John F. More,
a brother of the late Henry A. More,
who, made a fortune raising sheep and
cattle on the island of Santa Rosa, off
the Southern California, coast. When
Henry More died there was a scramble
among the relatives for his million-^
dollar estate. A bitter struggle in the
courts ensued, the brothers and sisters
of the deceased taking sides. No soon
er was this struggle ended than an
other grew out of the desire to share
in the estate of an unmarried sister
who died, and that disagreement is still
being fought out in the Alameda Coun
ty courts.
Since coming to the university More
has been exceedingly popular. His pop
ularity was won on the football field,
upon which he has been a hero for four
years.
Mr. and Mrs. More are living at the
Rouse home. It is understood, how
ever, that there is something to settle
on the parental! side of the question
and that several conferences have been
held between young More and his fath
er, who came up from the south to talk
it over with his son.
As the story goes, "Johnny" More
and the former Miss Rouse, who had
been courting through all of the young
man's college days, went to San Rafael
one day some sixteen months ago and
were married. This is all anybody in
terested will admit.
OAKLAND, March 17.â "Johnny"
More is married. "Johnny" More, hero
of the California football, gridiron, so
ciety man, fraternity man, Golden Bear
man, Skull and Keys man, idol of the
university campus, is a benedict, and
the news has Just leaked out.
But "Johnny" won't saw a word
about it. He's as reticent as an oyster.
He won't say when it happened. He
won't say where it happened. . He will
not tell the preacher's name. He knows
the word has gone out and been passed
along the line. All his fraternity broth
ers at the Chi Phi housed know about
it and did know about it a long time
ago, but even to them "Jdhnny" has
confided nothing. When a friend asked
him to-day for details he said:
"Nothing doing."
Â¦ The girl in the case was Miss Mae
Ethel Rouse of Oakland. She shines
in Oakland society, is handsome arrf
her parents are Mr. and Mrs. W. A.
Rouse of 683 Thirty-fourth street.' Her
father is a commission merchant.

"There is a very noticeable washing
away of the north bank of the tidal
canal, close to the south wall of the
diverting ditch. As the bottom of the
ditch is much higher. than that of the
canal a break In the ditch is very apt
to occur and then the slickens of Sausal
Creek would enter directly into the
tidal canal and impair the value of that
waterway, on which the Government
expended so much money. I believe
that a mistake was made in construct
ing the diverting ditch so near to the
north bank of the tidal canal."
ALAMEDA, March 17.â With the con
tinuous rainfall and the consequent in
crease in the volume of water of Sausal
Creek that is carried from Fruitva!e
avenue in a diverting ditch running
close to the north side of the tidaL canal
and into San LÂ»eandro Bay, there is a
danger that the retaining wall may
give way and permit its water anJ
slickers to empty directly into the tidal
canal. Should this happen the divert
ing ditch, which cost the United States
Government $55,000 to construct, would
be practically useless.
Sausal Creek originally emptied Into
the tidal canal near Fruitvale avenue.
In order to prevent the large channel
from becoming: filled with the debrl*
brought down by the stream a divert
ing ditch and wall was laid out along
the north side of the canal to San
Leandro Bay. So close is the diverting
ditch to the canal that in some places
but a few feet of earth Intervenes be
tween the north side of the big ditch
and tha south side of the small ditch.
Storm water and the action of the tides
through the tidal canal are gradually
undermining the diverting ditch and
engineers who have inspected the ex
isting conditions say that if some meas*
uies are not taken the water and debris
of Sausal Creek will In time make their
way into the tidal canaL In speaking
of the matter City Engineer W. R.
Poyser said:

Mrs. Barrie completed giving her
testimony to-day and has charged hÂ«r
husband with railroading her to an
asylum, cruelty and immorality. So
far her most damaging statements are
uncorroborated. Her sister. Miss Mary
Herrick, took the stand to-day, but her
testimony was of a more general char
acter and while it was in favor of
Mrs. Barrie, she knew nothing of
Barrie's alleged shortcoming's.
Mrs. Eva Webster and Miss Balweg,
two nurses from the Livermore sani
tarium, have testified to the effect that
Mrs, Barrie was mentally unsound for
It is given out that an important
female witness in the Barrie divorce
suit has refused to answer a summons
and has left for parts unknown. It
is believed, however, that she is now
at North San Juan, in Nevada County.
According- to a statement made to the
court to-day by attorneys for Mrs.
Barrie, Mrs. W. E. Howell of 4 Hyde
street, San Francisco, and formerly
Miss Cas?ie Archer of North San Juan
is a material witness in their case and
has disappeared. They will take stejis
on Monday to have the court issue an
order for her appearance.
Mrs. Howeil, it Is said, was courted
by Barrie in 1899 while she was Miss
Archer, he representing to her that he
was a single man. Hince then she
has been married and is reluctant to
be connected with the case and has
said that she would leave the country
before- she would testify. She was
employed in a store at North San Juan
and did the purchasing for the firm
by which she was employed. Barrie,
as a traveling: salesman, came to know
her and it is said represented to her
that he was unmarried.

Rather than to leave California and
make her home in the East Mrs. Lo
retta V. York toc-k her 10-months-old
child and left home Tuesday night, and
sent her husband, M. A. York, hurry
ing off to the police to recover his miss
ing wife and baby.
The Yorks resided at 2112 Adeline
street." The husband, who had rela
tives east of the Rocky Mountains, ar
ranged to go to them, believing he
could better his cc-ndition. York met
objections from his young: spouse, who
was strenuously opposed to the change.
She was Californian and was so loyal
to her native State that she would
not for a mc-ment consider the pro
posed change. It . was California or
nothing.
Then Mrs. York disappeared. The
husband's appeal to the police was
successful so far as locating the miss
ing wife was concerned, but York was
not willing to say whether he had con
vinced her that she should relent in her
decision not to go with him.
"You see, I am an Eastern man," ex
plained York, "and my wife is a Cali
fornian. My father wanted me to re
turn because I could better myself with
him. But I could not persuade ray
wife. When I began making prepara
tions to go my wife left me and I
thought she would not come back."
The police found Mrs. York and her
baby with friends.

There the controversy hung until
Jones hastened to Oakland yesterday
and caused Blessing's arrest. The case
was continued until Monday in the
Police Court.
Blessing's attorney insisted that
Jones' counsel, Johnson & Johnson of
San Francisco, had given orders that
he should not see the books.
Now comes Charles B. Blessing, for
mer manager of the ' Racycle bicycle
branch agency at 74 San Pablo avenue,
who is charge/i with embezzlement by
F. M. Jones of Sacramento, principal
California manager of the company,
and declares that he stands ready to
meet any obligation that Jones can
prove his former.employe owes.
While Jones insists that he- has been
mulcted to the tune of $1200 or so, Bless
ing appeared in the Police Court this
morning with his attorney, John W.
Gwilt, who made a statement to the
court touching his client's side of the
difficulty.
Gwilt declared that Blessing had not
been connected with the Racycle
agency for several months; that a dis-,
pute arose concerning the financial re
lations; that Blessing . claimed Jones
owed him; that Blessinjj would not
make any settlement- until the books
could be experted to decide what was
the fact.
"If the books show that Blessing
owes Jones we shall be ready to set
tle," said Gwilt.

A bill of considerable interest to
business men of the Pacific Coast is
now pending before Congress, remov
ing the restriction of the coinage of
nickels and bronze coins to the Phila
delphia Mint. The bill has passed the
Senate and has been favorably report
ed by the House committee, which
practically assures Irs passage.
This will permit the coinage of
nickels and bronze coins at the San
Francisco Mint and thus prove a con
venience to the business public of this
coast in securing these minor coins In
such quantities and at such times as
may be desired. Superintendent
Frank A. Leach states that this coin
age will not cause any great addition
to the working force of the Mint.
A statement prepared by Thomas
Burns, cashier of the sub-treasury
here, shows a wonderful increase in
the circulation of these minor coins
on this coast within the last seven
years. In 189 7 the assistant treasurer,
paid to the public $36,165 in nickels
and $4522 in pennies. During 1903
these . -amounts ! were increased to
$110,400 in nickels and $15,765 in pen
nies, showing an increase in the cir
culation of these coins of nearly 400
per cent. In addition several thousand
dollars' worth of these coins are an
nually shipped to Manila.

Two severe contingencies would seem
to threaten the representatives of at
least one-third of the entire number
of California counties ! that will have
exhibits at the St. Louis Exposition.
They may either be compelled to walk
when they go on to install the county
specimens or to pay the full rate of
fare to St. Louis. That at least is
the situation as it stands to-day. To
morrow evening Commissioner Filcher
will depart for St. Louis, unless some
thing happens to prevent. After he
goes there â¢will be no one remaining
in California to certify to the trans
continental railway people in behalf of
the county representatives who wish to
go to St. Louis on official business in
connection with exhibits.
"It isn't my fault," said Commissioner
Filcher yesterday afternoon. "I have
written repeatedly to the county com
mittees having in charge the prepar
ing of county displays for St. Louis.
Many of the committees ' have been
dilatory. In a recent letter sent out
from the office of the California com
mission notice was given that the 15th
of March would be the final date for
making application for transportation
at a reduced rate, for it was supposed
that the headquarters would be cloSed
by the 15th.
"There is only one more full day
now for any one to apply for a certifi
cate before we close up here. Then it
will be necessary for the counties that
still delay to send on to St. Louis and
the going and coming of the necessary
letters will take up ten days of time,
and there is no time to lose now.
"Perhaps the belated counties will
take advantage of to-day to make their
applications/ If they fail the situation
is as described; their representatives
will be either compelled to pay full
fare, walk to St. Louis or waste much
valuable time waiting for the mails,
while the exposition is hastening to its
opening day."
Yesterday Avery telegraphed ahead
to this city to C. Lacy Goodrich, for
mer purser of the steamship America
Maru, who had been staying at the
Palace Hotel, to immediately prepare
for a trip to Japan, and, following these
instructions. Goodrich went up the
road yesterday to meet Avery and last
evening the purser started for Seattle,
where he will catch the steamer sail
ing Monday. Avery accompanied Good
rich as far as Sacramento for the pur
pose of instructing him In the purposes
of his mission. According to a report
circulated last evening, Avery, who has
unlimited authority to act for his com
pany, has already secured one steam
ship in the Orient and has dispatched
Goodrich to the other side to arrange
for bringing the vessel over to this
port. The only statement that Avery
would make in connection with this
story was that his company is pre
paring to resume business between San
Francisco and the Orient and that it
would probably have its first new
steamship here within the next forty
days. The company will continue to
operate its vessels in conjunction with
those of the 'Pacific Mail under an old
agreement, which has been extended.
William H. Avery, general agent of
the Toyo Kisen Kaisha Steamship
Company and who has been in the
East several months,' returned yester
day, but departed on the' Oregon train
for Sacramento. Avery's return, to San
Francisco has been anxiously awaited
by many who are interested in the fu
ture of the Toyo Kisen Kaisha Steam
ship Company, whose^ vessels. were re
cently appropriated by the Japanese
Government for service in its trans
port fleet. It was reported recently
from the East that the company was
negotiating with the White Star line
for the purchase of several vessels to
take the places of the America Maru,
Nipon Maru and the Hongkong Maru
on the runs between this port and the
Orient. It was admitted by Avery that
the company expects to soon have an
other fleet tff steamships operating be
tween here and the Orient, but he de
nied that the vessels would come from
the White Star line, although intimat
ing that the company had obtained
options on a number of good boats on
the Atlantic and one or two In Oriental
waters.
Among the officers who paid respects
to General MacArthur yesterday were
Captain S. L. H. Slocum, Captain L. P.
Williamson, First Lieutenant A. B.
Cox and Second Lieutenant L. E. Davis
of the Eighth Cavalry, who came out
from Jefferson Barracks, near St.

Interesting Experiment In a Restau-
rant.
An advertising; agent, representing a
prominent New York magazine, while
; on a recent "VVestern trip, was dining
j one evening in a Plttsburg restaurant.
While waiting for his order he*
glanced over his newspapen^and no-
1 ticed the advertisement of a well-
: known dyspepsia preparation, Stuart's
1 Dyspepsia Tablets. As he himself was
a regular user of the tablets, he began
j speculating as to how many of the
! other traveling men in the dining-
room were also friends of the popular
remedy for indigestion.
He says: I 'counted twenty-three
men at the tables, and In the hotel of-
fice I took the trouble to interview
them and was surprised to learn that
nine of the twenty-three made a prac-
: tice of taking one or two of Stuart's
I Dyspepsia Tablets after each meal.
One of them told me he had suf-
i fered so much from stomach trouble
that at one time he had been obliged
to quit the road, but since using
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets had been
' entirely free from Indigestion, but he ,
I continued their use, especially while
traveling, on account of IrregularUy
of meals and because, like all travel-
Ing men, he was often obliged to eat
what he could get and not always
what he wanted.
Another, who looked the picture of
health, said he never ate a meal with-
out taking a Stuart Tablet afterward
because he could eat what he pleased
and when he pleased without fear of
a sleepless night or any other trouble.
_. Still another used them because he
was subject to gas on stomach, caus-
ing pressure on heart and lungs,
shortness of breath and distress in
chest, which he no longer experienced
since using the tablets regularly.
Another claimed that Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets was the only safe
remedy he has ever found for sour
stomach and acidity. He had former-
ly used common soda to relieve the
trouble, but the tablets were much
better and safer to use.
After smoking, drinking or other
excesses which weaken the digestive
organs, nothing restores the stomach
to a healthy, wholesome condition so
effectually is Stuart's Tablets.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets contain
the natural digestives, pepsin, dias-
tase, which every weak stomach lacks,
as well as nux, hydrastin an'd yellow
parilla. and can be safely relied on as
a radical cure for every form of poor
digestion. Sold by druggists every-
where.

depend on a single, badly laid line of

THE tumult of war sounds in Eastern Asia",; where
medieval Russia meets modern, civilization in Ja
pan. China and Japan were opened to the world
ostensibly that they might be modernized and take on
Western civilization as far as it might prove to be
adapted to their racial character. Japan proceeded to
completely assimilate that civilization. She has a com
plete system of jurisprudence, based on the common law,
a system of public education and a representative gov
ernment. It Is for the Western nations to decide
whether it is preferable that these institutions extend to
Eastern Asia or that the brutal and gloomy and hopeless
autocracy of Russia shall fall like a shadow upon that
part of the earth. The combat is between the ideas of
the twentieth; century, represented by Japan, and the
world of the time of Ivan the Terrible.
The tendency "and genius of a people are shown in
small matters as well as in great. One incident of this
war should not escape notice. The Japanese have re
spected women, cared for their wounded enemies and
conducted, themselves in the most praiseworthy manner
toward prisoners. In exploring the- : wreck, of the Rus

Against this judgment an appeal
was made to the High Court in Leip
sic. The Judges there also came to
the conclusion that the case could not
be dealt with as one of theft, nor coul.1
they see that any evidence of dam
age to property had been adduced.
But at the same time the High Court
declared that the sentiment of jus
tice imperatively demanded the pun
ishment of the guilty girl and the mat
ter was accordingly referred back to
the Judges at Cologne, with instruc
tions to ascertain whether, after all.
the pots and pans might not have been

The end of the case, .which has al
ready lasted nine months, has not yet
been reached. â London Truth.
In a fit df temper a kitchenmaid on
a Rhine steamer threw overboard all
the sots and pans she had to clean.
There were two previous convictions
against her for theft and she was ac
cused of stealing the pots and pans.
The Cologne Judges held, however,
that as she had only thrown the uten
sils overboard^ the charge of theft
could not be sustained and they fur
ther decided that she could not be
convicted of .damaging her employer's
property. Inasmuch as the pots ami
pans were probably reposing uninjured
at the bottom of the river.
Among the sampan traders in Hong

The coolies offer the canary or thrush

and guarantee the feathered prisoners

birds are purchased by many a home
coming traveler and the buyer finds
that the bird merchant has not liedâ
at least for a couple of days out from
port. But Invariably the little warblers
mysteriously lose their warble after
forty-eight hours or so and forever
afterward are minus the feeblest sort
of a chirp.
Investigation has discovered the
cause of the peculiar lapse and it has
been traced to one of those "ways that
are dark and tricks that are vain."
The Chinese dealers have learned that
to stuff the throats of their birds with
red pepper will make them glorious
singers as long as the effect lasts. After
that passes a bird, not naturally a
singer, relapses and is silent and often
dies from the effect of the burning
powder. It's a. trick In tune with that
of the man who Invented wooden nut
megs. For mind you, that while the
natural singing canary has a big mar
ket value the bird that can't sing Is not

The work is so arranged that those desiring credits
leading to a normal school diplomaUvill be allowed to
take two subjects and by doing extra work be given a
term's credit in those two subjects. Many teachers have
already signified their intention of attending again this
year and from present prospects 300 teachers arc likely
to enroll.
The location of the school is ah ideal one for the pur
pose, as San Jose is not only a beautiful city in itself,
but is well equipped with libraries, parks, schools and
churches, has a highly cultured society and is full of in
fluences toward intellectual work.
THE growth of the summer school movement in this
country has been remarkable. For less than ten
years have regular courses been offered by the uni
versities during the summer. Last year all the leading
Eastern universities offered full courses by regular in
structors for a term of six weeks or more.- The success
of the university summer school idea has no doubt
caused the Eastern normal schools to adopt the plan.
One year ago President Dailey of the San Jose State
Normal School presented to the Joint Board of Normal
Trustees at San Diego the plan of a summer session to
be held at the San Jose Normal. It met with the unani
mous approval of the entire joint board. Governor Par
deej State Superintendent Thomas J. Kirk and the
presidents of all^ the. other State normals indorsed the
movement.
It was' an experiment, as it had not been tried by any
normal school on this coast before. The argument then
offered was that there was a distinct need for such sum
mer school, because over half of the elementary teachers
of California had had no professional training and no
opportunity had been offered to them so Jong as they
continued in school duripg the year. It was also argued
that this would meet the needs of all those who were en
gaged in the primary and grammar schools better than
the university summer school, which was not intended
especially for grade teachers.
The summer school at San Jose opened June 20, 1903,
and 175 teachers were enrolled. Regular normal school
work was offered in all lines. The fact that one half of
those who ' enrolled have since entered the normal
school as regular students proves conclusively the popu
larity of the movement.
The history of the summer sessions of the Eastern
normals shows in every case a large increase from year
to year. Of the eighteen Eastern normal schools hold
ing summer sessions last year some show an enrollment
of from 600 to 700 students. Only two normal schools
in this country enrolled more students for the first sum
mer term than did San Jose. One enrolled 180 and an
other 185.. There is no reason why a large plant where
several hundred thousand dollars has been invested
should lie idle one-fourth of the year.
The whole function of. a normal school is to prepare
the best possibly equipped teachers for the State. The
only excuse a normal school has for asking for an ap
propriation for support is that the teachers of the State
may thereby be made more efficient.
If by holding a summer session the efficiency of the
teaching force of the State may be increased with a com
paratively small increase in expense this movement
should meet with the unqualified approval of all tax
payers.
As planned for the coming summer the session will be
six weeks in length, closing the first week in August. No
tuition will be charged. * All regular work is to be given
in the forenoon, leaving the entire afternoon for labora
tory, library work, etc. A number of interesting excur
sions have been planned for the afternoons and Satur
days. A trip to Mount Hamilton, the seat of the famous
Lick Observatory, also a yacht ride on San Fran
cisco Bay, besides shorter excursions to near-by places
of interest, will be made.
SUMMER SCHOOL MOVEMENTS.
With hard times . in; the.- Transvaal,
the prospect of finding; some of Ma
gato'js. bucketful of "diamonds . is likely
to start large numbers treasure hunt
ing. And other tragedies are more than
likely to follow'.â Washington Post. '/â¢
Magato did not swear Rhodes and
the other spectators to secrecy, and
some things leaked out. This led to
the formation of several private syndi
cates to try to obtain the diamonds
from the chiefâ by purchase or other
wise. But all efforts failed. And as
to getting them any other way â Ma
gato in his mountain stronghc-ld, with
thousands of Kaffirs ready to fight for
him, was a very dangerous man on
whom to attempt anything approaching
burglary ot^ highway robbery. But no
white'man In the Transvaal would ever
have long survived the story that he
ptrssessed a bucketful of diamonds
which were not locked up In a burglar
proof safe. ' ""'.'. "
After a while, among the few who
had heard of it and failed to get even
a glimpse of the gems' for the money
they had put up, the story of the buck
etful of. diamonds was\ generally re
garded as a myth, and emissaries of
the syndicate ceased to trouble Ma
gato.
Then there came a day when the
"Lion of the North" fell sick, and real
ized that the hand of death was upon
him. He hated Mpefu, his nephew
and the heir to the chieftainship. He
had tried to get him set aside in favor
of one df his own indunas. Balked in
this, he resolved that he would at^-least
prevent Mpefu from getting the bucket
of diamonds In his clutches. Summon
ing four of his most trusted chiefs,
he directed them to divide the dia
monds Into four lots, take them far
away and bury them, and tell no man
where they had hidflen them, under
penalty of being haunted In this world
and tortured in the next. The chiefs
promised to obey, and when the dia
monds had been parceled out among
them two of them set out for Matabele
Land and the two others, according
to .the story, trekked toward the Se
lati, In which region the remains of
Van Niekerk were subsequently found.
And to obtain this, treasure, or some
portion erf it, Swartz got tqgether the
search party.
The tragic sequel to the treasure
seeking expedition In the Transvaal,
furnished by the sentence to death at
Johannesburg of Phillipus Swartz, the
organizer of the expedition, for the
murder of . one of his companions,
Stephanus Van Niekerk, has brought to
light a story so strange and romantic,
and dealing with such fabulous hid
den wealth, that recalls some of the
South African romances of Rider Hag
gard. It starts appropriately with the
colossus of South Africa. Cecil Rhodes.
In 1S&0, fresh from the conquest of
the Matabeles and the acquisition of
Rhodesia, he received an invitation to
visit Magato, a renowned and power
ful Kaffir chief, known as the "Lion
of the North," and the unconquered
foe of the Boers. Magato wished to
have a pow-wow with the "Lion of the
South." as he desighated Rhodes, con
cerning matters in the territory that
had just been colored red on the Brit
ish map. At the Kaffir chiefs strong
hold, on the top of a high mountain,
the two strong men met, Rhodes being
accompanied by Sir John Wilioughby,
Justice Lang and D. C. de Waal.
When they had finished discussing
affairs of state, the wily old Kaffir,
wishing to impress Rhodes and his
companions with his wealth as well
as his power, showed him a bucket
filled with diamonds â magnificent
ones. Rhodes was not a man to ex
press surprise at anything. Once be
fore he had seen a bucketful of dia
monds, -which played an important
part in the amalgamation of the Kim
berley mines. After examining some
of the stones he made a mental esti
mate of the value of the contents of
the bucket as something between $12.
000.000 and $20,000,000. Then he
asked the Magato where he got them.
The chief answered that they had
been given him as "presents" from time
to time by his native subjects, who had
worked in the diamond mines. That
meant, of course, that they had been
stolen and that Rhodes himself, as one
of the largest owners of the mines,
had had his pockets picked to the tune
of a very large fortune.
Rhodes always had a great respect
for men who did things on a large
scale. Besides, in dealing with sav
ages, he always exercised diplomacy.
Therefore he did not denounce Magato
as a receiver of stolon goods. He con
tented himself with intimating that
their possession might possibly â at
some future date â get the chief into
trouble. To which Magato replied, it
is said, that it would take more than
all the Transvaal police to get them
from him.
A Bucket of Diamonds.
The republics of Central America, it is said, arc
chafing under the restrictions of long continued peace.
Our mercurial southern friends should not unnecessarily
distract themselves. They know what to do to excite
war, and the rest of us have learned in the bitter and
abused school of experience what to do after war has
commenced. The world has ceased to consider the in
ternecine squabbles of Central Americans as war.
Experienced railroad men in the East
believe that Mr. Gould will eventually
carry out his plan of establishing a
through line to Baltimore, but they
look to see important concessions made
to the Pennsylvania Railroad. The
Cacsatt administration was never more
strongly Intrenched than it is now.
Knough proxies for the annual meeting
of stockholders to be held early in
March Jjave already beenfsent in to
phow that there is practically no oppo
sition to the Cassatt management. Mr.
Much that is untrue and absurd has
been ' written about the . warfare be
tween the GouWJ and Carnegie inter
ests. Prominence has been given to tbe
rumors that the Rockefellers have al
lied themselves with the Goulds to In
timidate the Pennsylvania â¢ Railroad
management and if necessary to force
A. J. Cassatt out of the control of that
great system. Actual facts, known to
most well-informed railroad men, prove
the absolute falsity of these rumors.
The Rockefellers, like other possessor*
of surplus funds, have invested in
Pennsylvania Railroad mock, but in a
comparatively small way. There are
now about 46,000 individual stockhold
ers of the Pennsylvania Railroad Com
pany â an increase of nearly 12,000 with
in one year. This remarkable diffusion
of Pennsylvania Railroad shares does
not .indicate that any effort has been
mede to concentrate the holdings of
ihese securities in the Interests of the
Rockefellers, the Goulds or any othor
particular Interest. A confidential rep
resentative of John D. Rockefeller told
ihe writer of this article a few days
ngro that the Rockefeller interests had
r.o more idta cf seeking control of the
Pennsylvania Railroad than they had
of buying Trinity Church in New York.
George J. Gould said Just before leav
ing: ICc-.v York for California: "It is
true that we have met with opposition
in our efforts to obtain traffic facilities
/*â¢? the Wabash system in Piitsburg,
but we hope to overcome all obstacles
and establish a thorough line to thÂ»
Atlantic Coast. We do not expect tc
buy any part of the Pennsylvania Rail
road system in' order to accomplish our
purpose. There certainly has been no
personal enmity engendered between
President CasEatt and myself."
Andrew Carnegie, angered at what
he termed the selfish and unconcilia
tory policy of the dominant railway
interests in the Pittsburg region, had
j'lans prepared for the construction of
an independent line fr$>m Pittsburg to
a point on "Lake Erie. His insistence
upon the carrying out of this project
was one of the * auses that led to the
formation of the great United States
Steel Corporation. Certain Wall street
interests became alarmed at Mr. Car
ir-ie's defiant and aggressive attitude
j-nd J. Pierpont Morgan was appealed
to to avert thÂ«Â» threatened onslaught
upon railroad harmony. Mr. Morgan
eliminated Carnegie as a factor in
traffic matters by forming the steel
trust, but not before the great iron
r-^tÂ»r,.as the head of the Carnegie
FtÂ»Â»el plant, had made a contract with
George J. Gould providing for the
turning over to the Wabash Railroad
of several millions of tons of freight
annually as soon as the Wabash lines
tould effect an entrance into Pitts
liurg territory.
The time limit of this Carnegie-Gould
contract has not yet expired, but the
Wabcsh Railroad is not in position to
avail itself of the coveted traffic priv
ileges. Through the purchase and ex
tension of the Wheeling and Lake Erie
Railroad the Goulds have gained an
entrance into Pittsburg, but as yet the
'â¢PT>le of promise is afar off. Notwith
standing the spirited opposition of the
Pennsylvania Railroad the Wabash
manaeement has built a bridge across
the Monongahela River and established
a terminal station in Pittsburg. But
this terminal ijÂ» suitable only for pas-
Fencer traffic and is cut off from the
Fteel plants by the refusal of the Pitts
burg municipal authorities to grant Hit
required right of way through the city
to a connection with a small road that
taps the steel plants. The Goulds have
spent about J40.000.000 thus far to get
into. Pittsburg and establish a through
line eastward to Baltimore, but until
they can loosen the grip of the Penn
sylvania Railroad on the Pittsburg
Council they stand little chance of
Retting the rich slice of freight traffic
that the Carnegie contract holds up to
view.
George J. Gould has been trying for
the lest fi\p years to get into Pittsburg
with his AVabash line. In this en
deavor h* has had the outspoken and
determined opposition of " the Penn
sylvania Railroad and the silent oppo
sition of the Vanderbilts. From a
freight traffic point of view the Pitts
l\irg region is counted by railroad
men as an unfailing bonanza. The
vast quantities of ore, coke, coal,
pieel and various manufactured prod
ucts handled at PittFburg have over
taxed the railroad facilities in this
territory for several years past, yet all
attempt? to build new railroads in this
rich field have been stubbornly re-
Fisted by powerful influences. The
Pennsylvania lines and the Vander
bilts' Pittsburg and Lake Erie road
are the on!y two railroads that have
access to the great Homestead. Brad
dock and the Jones and Laughlin steel
plants.

vent them from Â«doubling or trebling
that force If necessary. Again, the Rus
sians, like the British, always lose at
first. The corruption which does un
doubtedly permeate the beaurocracy
and the impossibility of getting so gi
gantic and unwieldy a machine into
working order at short notice make de
feats at the outset inevitable, and in a
sense self-inflicted. Russia invariably
needs time to pull herself together.
The Turkish war was a synopsis of all
Russian wars â the hasty and Imperfect
preparations, the run of disasters so
swift and complete that Czardom
seemed for the time to be toppling over,
and then the slow gathering up and
concentration of all her resources,, the
evolution and discovery of the right
manâ Russia is never without her Tod-
Iebens, and at a crisis nothing can keep
them downâ and the overwhelming and
persistent pressure of all that huge em
pire. It means, therefore, little or noth
ing that so far the Japanese have sub
stantially triumphed. They have placed
themselves in a commanding naval po
sition and secured their shores from
invasion; but they must expel Russia
from Manchuria and Korea before they
can claim the final victory. And that 13
an enterprise compared with which the
Crimean war becomes a mere episode.â
Sydney Brooks, in Harper s "Weekly.
That is an uncalled for rebuke from an incompetent
source. When the Tim<vs learns enough about that par.t
of the State that is not in sight from Mount Lowe to
know that Northern California has ten acres of orange
country to one in Southern California, and that in
Northern California the date ripens the farthest north
in the world, it will be equipped to sit in judgment upon
the ignorance of others. There should be no sectional
ism in this State. There is room for emulation and com
petition, out of which issue benefits to all.
Now these are facts. .To state them is not derogatory
to any part of the State, but is creditable to California as
a whole. They seem to furnish no reason for the Times
for saying: "We do not believe in narrow prejudices,
holding that all true Californians should take pride in
the prosperity and progress of this magnificent State as
a whole. San Francisco is the leading delinquent in this
direction. The people of San Francisco resemble the in
habitants of Paris in many ways, among others in their
self-satisfied assumption that San Francisco is Cali
fornia, just as your true Parisian believes that Paris is
France. The average San Franciscan also knows as little
of the resources and natural features of the State, beyond
the picnic resorts around the bay, as the boulevardier
knows of provincial France."
That is not a candid statement of the facts. The-ship
ment of citrus fruits from north of the Tehachapi in 1903
amounted to nearly 2300 carloads. That is small in com
parison with the magnificent production of Southern Cal
ifornia, but it is a great increase over the shipments of
ten years ago. Its chief significance is that it proves the
orange producing capacity of Central and 'Northern Cal
ifornia, and it proves also that the region adapted to
profitable citrus production north of the Tehachapi is
much greater in area than south of that dividing line.
The northern citrus belt runs from Porterville to Oro
ville on the east side of the valley, goes up the mountains
as high as the Loomis and Ward ranches on the Merced
River, and stretches across the Sacramento Valley from
Placer County, passes the spurs of the Coast Range and
appears in Sonoma County, as is proved by the annual
citrus fair at Cloverdale. Butte, Yuba, Colusa and Sut
ter counties are all orange producers, and up to this time
there has been no damage to trees or fruit by frost or
drought since planting began about fifteen years ago.
The northern citrus belt produces *ripe and market
able oranges nearly three months earlier than Southern
California, for reasons permanent in their nature which
The Call has already explained. This advantage is not
boasted to decry Southern California, but to present the
great and interesting fact that this State has the longest
orange season of any part of the world. Our early
northern crop in no waj' interferes with the later
southern crop. It meets a market that the south cannot
supply, for its oranges are green at that time. The
southern crop meets, a market that the north cannot
supply, for its oranges are all harvested and the orchards
are blooming for the next crop.
The Los Angeles Times has been such a considerable
factor in the development of Southern California that it
can afford not to bite the thumb at the rest of the State.
In a recent issue it attacks the State Bo|ard of Trade
year book and incidentally the, people north of the Te
hachapi. It says: "It is remarkable how averse the good
people of Northern California are to giving full credit to
the southern part of the State for its wonderful achieve
ments in the line of development during the past twenty
years, and especially during the last decade."
Then the Times proceeds to a specific review of Gen
eral Chipman's report in the year book to this effect:
"The statement of General Chipman that 'the south still
claims superiority in orange and lemon production'
is rich in view of the facts. The citrus fruit shipments
from Southern California this season will probably
amount to 30,000 carloads. We are willing to admit that
orange planting in the north is rapidly increasing, as it
has been for over twenty years, greatly to the advantage
of Southern California nurserymen if not so much to
that of the planters." #
The State is injured by sectional claims of peculiar re
sources denied to other regions. Southern California has
had a wonderful development that holds high rank' in all
comparative statements, because it began later and pro
gressed long after the rest of the State had felt. the im
pulse of its capacities. No. one is jealous of that prog
ress, and no good Californian would minimize it in the
least degree, for it all melts into the alluring perspective
in which. the State is seen from beyond. its borders.
THE annual year book of the State Board of Trade
is a statement of the facts . concerning the State's
production for each year. As such it is an invalu
able part of the State's industrial literature. Every sec
tion of California, the south below the Tehachapi Pass,
the central from that point north to the delta country,
and Northern California embracing the Sacramento, are
faithfully reported, and each gets credit for its merits and
the enterprise of its people.
This particular dog plays the part
of decoy to the wayfaring waifs of dog
dom that come within the poundman's
ken. So- cleverly does this homely brute
do his work that many an unfortu
nate, yelping cur Is lured into the
lariat's noose, all unaware that his
brother has so basely betrayed him
to his doom.
Observers of the way the decoy dog
operates have discovered that he knows
a coilarless, licenseless dog as far as
he can see one. And he never dis
turbs those that wear the legal author
ization to roam *at will. But you should
see him nab a canine waif of .the
streets. Very quietly he drops behind,
letting the wagon run some distance
ahead to avert suspicion, for these
street dogs are very cunning and know
the poundman well. Then the decoy
ambles up to the unsuspicious object
of capture. There is some "dog talk"
that becomes interestingâ so interest
ing, in fact, that the candidate | does
not notice the approaching lariat
thrower. The noose tightens and the
canine prisoner is cast into the per
ambulating cart to be borne off to sure
death. /
Sometimes the decoy meets a much
bigger dog than himself. Deliberately
he will engage in a, fight that unfail
ingly brings the lassoer, who quickly
adds one more to the catch of the day.
The poundmen say their low bred de
coy is worth many a dollar to them,
for he will lure to capture many a dog
that otherwise would escape the pur
suing dog-catcher.
The much abused but necessary
poundman finds himself the target foT
so much epithet and oftentimes vio
lent Interference with his duties that
he Is compelled to resort to much sub
terfuge to carry on his very important
public office of cleaning the thorough
fares of stray animals, the
homeless dogs. Across the bay in Oak
land the poundkeeper has enlisted the
services of a dbg, a cleverly trained
mongrel, that can be seen daily trot
ting behind the wagon that serves as a
cage for lassoed canines.
The Western Union-Pennsylvania
railway controversy, which has beeft
much exaggerated, is an incident of the
Gould-Cassatt railroad fight.
Cassatt's position as president of the
Pennsylvania Railroad system is
unique. Although he is only a "hired j
man" he has practically unrestricted j
control of the properties in his charge, j
and his power to make and carry out j
policies is as unquestioned as is that of j
W. K. Vanderbllt." E. H. Harriman. j
George J. Gould, J. Pierpont Morgan 'â¢
or James J. Hill, each of whom is ac- i
customed to regard ordinary railroad j
presidents as mere puppets to come at ;
beck and call and obey orders without j
asking the reason why. ;
Nobody understands the scope of A. j
J. Cassatt's power more accurately ;
than does George J. Gould, and per- j
haps no railroad man comprehends Mr. J
Gould's capabilities better than Mr. j
Cassatt. The test of strength between
these two men is now in its last stage, j
and it Is only reasonable to believe that ,
the result will be a compromise with- |
out humiliation to either and produc- ]
live of real advantages to the inter
ests of both as well as the greater inter
efts of the shipping and the traveling ;
public. It is an indisputable fact that j
an almost unbroken congestion of j
freight . traffic has prevailed in the ;
Pittsburg region for the past three ,
years because of inadequate railroad i
facilities.
It was an impressive scene, the soldiers of what we
call a pagan nation giving Christian sepulture- to their
dead enemies under a guard 'of honor furnished by the
war ships of two Christian republics, and rendering all
the honors of war to those who had withstood them in
battle and had fallen and could fight* no more.
It is in sharp contrast with the humiliating parade of
Japanese officers captured in skirmish to be insulted in
the streets of Dalny by the savage Cossacks, who have
made no advance in civilization since the time of the
Kahzars and are practically the same as their Scythian
ancestors.
The burial by the Japanese of the Russian dead is a
theme for the poets who will write the lyrics of this war.
It equals any incident in the history of warfare and puts
Japan high in the respect of the world.
I shore buried them with the honors of war. An Ameri
can reajd over them a Christian burial service and their,
coffins were drawn on caissons that were manned by
"Japanese sailors/and the Yankee and French blue jack
ets responded to the Japanese request and served as a
guard of honor. When the dead Russians were lowered
into their graves the Japanese soldiers fired a volley over
them and the bugle sounded taps.

Pontifical High Mass
Celebrated by the
Archbishop.
At the; conclusion of the pontifical
high mass Archbishop Montgomery
blessed the congregation.
Parents were especially cautioned to incul
cate the doctrines of Catholicism in the minds
of their children, and all Catholics were com
manded to lead lives that would cause their
religion to be looked upon as a religion of
honesty, sobriety and charity.
They were persecuted. They suffered the
Iofs of property, friend* and life, but In all
these persecutions they have stood like a rock,
unmoved In their faith. No other nation was
â¬\ver put to such a test, but the Irish emerged
triumphant.
You have spread the gospel of Christ and
goodness to every part of the world In the
past, and I exhort you to continue the work In
the future. Â«
Early In her religious history Ireland be
came known through the religious -world as the
Isle of Saints and Scholars. There were
preachers In every part of Ireland, and they
established churches, schools and hospitals In
every place that they were In.
A time of adversity finally came, and for
over a thousand years the people of Ireland
had to fight for their liberty. During that
time their spiritual belief never wavered.
For centuries efforts were made to anni
hilate the Catholic religion in Ireland, but the
people, no matter what internal dissensions
they were laboring under, always presented a
united faith to the foes of their Â¦ belief and
defeated them on every occasion.
St. Patrick first announced the gospel to the
barons and chieftains of Ireland, and coon
every person on the ieland was a Christian.
x Ireland is the only nation that received the
faith willingly and without the shedding of a
drop of blood. Before St. Patrick died Ire
land was as Catholic as she In to-day.
Every nation eets aside some day In the year
to honor its heroes. Some have heroes who
have achieved eminence in battle, others honor
those who were prominent In commerce, and
others commemorate the achievements of great
men in governmental affairs.
St. Patrick, the hero of Ireland, is not of this
class. His victories were all of a spiritual or
der. He led the Irish from Ignorant heathen-
Ism to the knowledge of heavenly good and
cverlastinr life.
Since then the Irish race has become a
kingly race â always ready to fight the battles
of the wronged and oppressed. The people of
Ireland have spread the light of religion and
civilization to the utmost corners of the earth.
We havo gathered together in this sacred
edifice this morning to utter that prayer which
goes up on the 17th of March from ' every
loyal Irish heart.
One of the moet .remarkable and "at the
same time one of the most admirable traits of
the Irish character Is the love it always dis
plays for, its native land. No matter where
an Irishman emigrates to, he always feels
proud of his nationality. And his son and
their !<ons p"fseÂ«s the same characteristics.
In fact, every j person through whom Irish
blood courses i* proud of the fact.
This, their festal day, is celebrated by
Irishmen in every place on land or sea where
an Irishman can be found. It is. an occasion
that binds all hearts together.
Not unmindful of the religious as
pect of the day. Catholic churches
were comfortably filled yesterday
morning by young and old eager to do
homage to the patron saint of Ire
land. St. Patrick's Church, on Mis
sion street, between Third and
Fourth, was filled to overflowing at the
pontifical high mass, .which was cele
brated by Archbishop Montgomery.
A portion of the church had been
reserved for the representatives of the
local Irish societies. The altar was
handsomely decorated, and in addition
to the organ an orchestra of stringed
instruments rendered beautiful music.
A well trained choir under the direc
tion of Miss Short lent additional at
tractiveness to the musical pro
gramme. At 10 o'clock Archbishop
Montgomery celebrated pontifical
high mass. Rev. J. M. Barry officiated
as deacon, Rev. M. Horan sub-deacon,
Rev. P. J. Cummins assistant to the
Archbishop, and Rev. P. E. Mulligan
master of ceremonies.
Father Concannon of Stockton
preached a sermon in the Gaelic
tongue on the life and the influence of
St. Patrick. The preacher is a man of
much eloquence and magnetism and
one of the leading orators in the Gae
lic language in the United States. Rev.
P. \V. Sullivan of the Potrero parish
and a graduate of one of the' French
theological colleges, also preached a
sermon. He said in part:

As representative a gathering of
prominent citizens of San Francisco as
ever stretched their legs beneath a
table attended the twenty-ninth annu
al banquet of the Knights of St. Pat
rick which was given at Delmonico's
last night. The dinner was served in
the main banquet hall, . which was
beautifully decorated with a profusion
of greenery and American and Irish
flags. The menu was a triumph of cul
inary art and the event a most pro
nounced success in every way. Better
than the dainty dishes and more exhil

feeling of love and good fellowship that
seemed to embrace every one of the
gathering.
Five hundred guests gathered to do
honor to the occasion. Prominent
among them were Chief Justice Beatty

An excellent orchestra furnished
music, alternating with American and

KNIGHTS OF ST. PATRICK.
The fame of Ireland's patron and na
tional hero, St. Patrick, was, loyally
celebrated yesterday by all patriotic
Irishmen in San Francisco. The in
clemency of the weather interfered
radly with some of the best features
arranged for the day, notably the great
grames of Gaelic sports which were to
be held on the Presidio athletic
grounds. These were necessarily post
poned until there is more favorable
weather, and will be held at a future
date to be announced hereafter.
The religious side of the great anni
versary was fully observted at the sev
eral churches whose membership
consists largely of Irish-Americans,
Pontifical high mass was celebrated
and special addresses in keeping with
the day were delivered. These services
were all attended by large numbers of
persons of Irish birth und descent, as
well as by hosts of others to whom the
Emerald [ate is merely a historic name.
The principal feature of the day's
events was the convention of the United
Irish Societies of San Francisco, held in
the evening at Mechanics' Pavilion.
Nearly 3000 men and women braved the
storm that raged outside to testify by
their presence and enthusiastic partici
pation in the celebration their love for
Erin and the memories evoked by her
name. A well-arranged programme of
addresses and musie was carried out
with complete success, and at its con
clusion the League of the Cross Cadets
grave a most effective exhibition of their
drills. The evening closed with a grand
ball, which lasted until a late hour.

He read the following letter from Mi

leader, who had been asked to deliver
the oration of the evening:

ORATION IiY \V. A. KELLY.
In Pavitt's absence the oration com
memorative of the anniversary was de

orator of ability and pood voice, who
held the attention of his hearers with
out difficulty for half an hour with elo
quent praises of Ireland and her saint.
He said among other things:
We clrbrate the anniversary of an event
fraucht with lmr>ortancÂ« to every eon of Ire
land. At the name of the great saint who
awakened tfc*- fatherland to hf-r destiny every
Irish hÂ«>art throbs to-night. AH countries have
their anniversaries, days in which hallowed
names are nia 3e n*>w in the minds of their
children with fcw? and praiw. So Ireland and
rifT Bonn ibe world over delight to keep this
day, marks the ditenthrallment of thÂ»
Grf-en lslÂ«> fr'wn unbelief and her new birth
of faith and lit^ratur*'.
We are hire to Indicate that the spirit of
ratriitlsm !s= not dÂ«-ad, but will I've while
Ireland herself remains to claim the love of
her Eor.g. To-nicht. as we glance backward
over the centuries of Irish history, we behold
rrn*ch to deserve our pride. With the fall of
the Roman Â«-ciDlre the Irish legions returned
to tbPir native inland and devoted th?m?Hves
to the arts oi letters. Industry and peace.
They drvHcppd a code of laws that remain
iroof to-<!ay of great intellectual and legal
ability.
But it remained for Ft. Patrick to bring to
Ireland the true faith of the church that rosÂ«
Â¦:Â¦Â¦Â¦" the ruins of the empire. His disciples
frread thlF faith far from the shores of Erin,
in Scotland, on the batiks of the Rhine, among
thÂ»- olive groves of Spain. The blood of Irish
ir.ifsioT!Â»ry rosrtyr* crtmsonÂ«vi the soil of
ir.any :Â¦.-.Â¦â¢:- Happy in this faith, Ireland daz
zk-d the world by the brilliance of her litera
ture and the learning of her scholars.
Such eminence brougfct the? penalties of envy
and war. But the Irish soldier drove back
thÂ» Dane from his country's soil. Her na
tionality and Ej>eech were successfully prÂ«s
fÂ«rip<i uiitil the Sajcon turned his grwsly eyes
to fair fie)Â«^ t^yond the Irish Sea. By a sys
tem of rarine. oppression, confiscation and
UMUflU without parallel in history, the Kng
l!*h. domir.ion was faFtened upon the land.
IJut though fortune turned to him a frowning
countenance, the j?j>!rit of the Irishman was
r.'ver eutidued. Coercion nev*>r begets amity,
*nd tb* oppression of the Hngllsh begot in
Ir1Â»h hearts Viurning hatred that later centu
*~\+h havr* **-nly a'^centuatf-d. Hero after hero
row to flcrht unsuccessful battles for Ireland,
but it rÂ«-main*<l for 0'Conn<Â»lI to wake anew
thÂ» Irish national seplratlonc. In th* nine
i^er.th century he was followed by n host if
I-R-Jprs. B-tt. Parr:<*U. Davitt and many oth

Mr. Kelly's oration was liberally ap

*Ve. the reprÂ»*Â«*ntÂ« lives of th# United Irish
P<x-ieÂ»iÂ« in convention assembled, view with
srstiScatlon the substantial advance made by
Â»!se Irish pecple In the r.a*Fare of the land act
by the British rarlUm*nt, and we sincerely
hop* that whatever defect It may possess will

WV are tho gratified at the great progreM
made by tb<? GaHIc League Jn Its endeavor to
revlv* the ancient language of our country, *
language no rich in Its associations with all
that is print in the rast. xrlth all that is
beautiful in our tlterature an<1 patriotic In

a people U one of the rooet powerful factors
In preserving their nationality, and Â¦** would
be not only a national disgrace but a loss to
mankind, that a language so old in Its history,
â¢o capable of expressing all the feelings and
emotions of a people should be allowed to
perish. - .:,.-':
While we vlow with deep Interest the acqui
sition cf the land by our people, and their ex
â¢Ttioni to preserve and to perpetuate our lan
guage. Ftill we trust that the representatives
of the Irish people in the British Parliament
Â¦will not forget that they will never be satis
fled until their aspirations as a separate and
diÂ«lnct nationality are realized and they poÂ»
kÂ« the management and control of their own
domestic affairs, in accordance with the genius
of our people.
We can never be Indifferent to any move
r>*mt In which our people at home are engaged^
and consequently w pledge ourseKes to give
whatever material and moral support we can
give to them tn their endeavor to secure for
our native land those blessings of self-govern
ment which we enjoy here.
As citizens of the United States wo view
with concern the war at prevent being waged In

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, March
1". â The first rowing match between
Stanford and the University of Cal
ifornia is being arranged by the boat
ing clubs of the two universities. The
race will be between the freshman
crews and will take place on the Oak
land estuary the latter part of April.
The contest will not be regarded as a
regular intercollegiate event for the
r^dKon that the Associated Students of
Stanford have not yet recognized
boating as an intercollegiate sport.
The crew that will represent the
Stanford freshmen- has not been se
lected, but the most likely candidates
as shown by practice this season are

prosperous ladies' tailor, was found In
bed . in the Salvation Army lodging
house at 629 Clay street yesterday
morning with his throat cut. The
man'was removed to the Central Emer
gency Hospital, where the wound was
sewed up. The reason assigned by
Limamotti for attempting to take his
life is that he was tired of life and
considered himself . better dead. He
will probably recover.

at the Presidio, was found by Patrol

The indications yesterday were that
the opening betting on the fight will
be 10 to 7. with Corbett favorite. The
volume of money wagered will quickly
determine what will be the prevailing
odds. The Bale of seats commences this
morning at Harry Corbett's. The prices
range from 520 for the ringside boxes
to $2 in the gallery.
Britt receives his lesson daily after
he has completed his physical labors.
Yesterday Jimmy went through his
usual routine in his gymnasium. He is
e waiting the arrival of next week,
which will see the end of his dally
training grind. Britt will on next Mon
day commence to take off weight and
Â¦will gradually get down to the 130
pound notch.
As the days go by Jimmy Britt is
paying close attention to the advice
piven him by Spider Kelly, his trainer,
and the little fighter now knows in de
tail how his mentor would fight the
battle if he were to go up against
Young Corbett. Kelly's advice and
Â¦wisdom on affairs pertaining to the ring
are accepted as valuable by all who
are interested in the doings of fighters
when in action.
Corbett boxed two more rounds
with of the boys, but after the
little knockdown incident neither was
anxious to get in and do any more
mixing. Corbett worked up a good
jtersplration and ( was fresh and
healthy looking after getting his final
rubdown.
Then Monte Attell relieved him and
Corbett allowed the latter to punch
him good and hard. Attell seemed
afraid of those hard ones to the jaw
and always retired to a respectful
distance as soon as he landed a punch.
Then Bobby came up for the second
round, willing to mix it. He started
rfter the champion as though he were
anxious to earn the title himself. They
Â¦were mixing it rapidly and Bobby was
endeavoring to break away from a
clinch when suddenly Corbett shot
over a left and down went Johnson.
He was about all in, but came up and
then Harry Tuthill and Tim McGrath
stopped the bout on the spot. The
little incident created a furor of ex
citement in the gym, for it looked like
the real article for b moment. Cor
bett used big pillows of gloves, which
means he is hitting a :300 clip.
After his rub down Corbett went to
luncheon and then enjoyed Ms rest
Just as much as ever. Soon after
luncheon Casey, the piper, arrived and
played a few tunes In honor of the
immortal St. Patrick. This put Cor
bett in good humor for work and
when he finally got ready for the af
ternoon stunt in the gymnasium he
felt ready for any emergency.
After the preliminary tussle with
the weight machine and a few busy
minutes with the swinging bag and
the punching bag. the little fellow was
in prime condition for a few hot
rounds. He started in with Bobby
Johnson and the youngster set a hot
pace for the first round.
He ate so much yesterday morning
that he could not make fast headway
in the mud for a few miles. But that
did not bother him at all. When he
Â«ot started he made up for lost time
Â«nd fairly spun over the muddy ex
panse and back to the tavern.
They are becoming so accustomed
to the juicy weather out at Corbetfs
training quarters that they do not ex
pect anything else. When the champ
awakens from his slumbers and sees
the drops escaping from the heavens
he Just goes and disposes of an extra
quantity of breakfast and then starts
out on the road.

The drawing for the second and third
classes of the class singles tennis tour
nament to be played at Golden Gate
Park on Sunday was held last night.
Fifteen players entered the second class
and seventeen the third class. The
players In the second class are evenly
matched and some exciting games are
expected. In the third class a few Â«f
the players are considerably better than
the remainder, and the matches will
probably not prove close in most case*.
N. Ambrose was the winner of the
second class last time, but he will hare
a hard struggle beating men like Baker.
Janes and Brabant. The last namtd

155 to 17D pounds in the saddle.
Thomas H. Williams as presiding
Judge, Charles D. Jeffries as starter,
Robert Leighton as clerk of the scales
and the stewards performed their du
ties as well as the officials on the big
tracks could do.
SUMMARY.
Lucy Glitters was fractious at the
post in the flve-eighths-mtle race and
spoiled her chances. Carlotta, a South
ern California mare, won handily.
Lotrix ran out through the stretch and
would not try.
Mr. Tobin landed W. A. McCreery's
Jim first at the wire in the 200-yard
race for polo ponies. Mr. McCreery fin
ished second on his pony Prince.'
Mr. Skinner was again In evidence in
the fourth race, his vigorous urging of
Mr. Spreckels' thirteen-and-a-half-hand
pony Maud H landing the latter a win
ner. Paul Clagstone was a close second
on F. J. Carolan's Floradora.
I^OTRIX RUNS OUT.
The outcome of the affair yesterday
was that President Thomas H. Wil
liams of the New California Jockey
Club offered a $400 trophy for a match
race to be run at Oakland on Saturday
week if the track be fast. The distance
will be a quarter of a mile. Paul Clag
stone's Miss Miller will also start. Each
pony will carry a professional jockey
and 115 pounds.
R. M. Tobin, sporting the cerise, green
fleur-de-lis of Rudolph Spreckels, pilot
ed Peghome to victory in the first race.
He won easily by a length and a half
from Queen Rucker, the Southern Cali
fornia pony.
Frank Skinner on Mr. Spreckels'
Becky won the second race cleverly by
half a length from Sunset, ridden by
W. A. McCreery.
THREE IX MATCH RACE.
The races of the California Polo and
Pony Racing Association at Tanforan
racecourse yesterday proved a sporting
surprise despite the unpropitious weath
er conditions. The attendance was lim
ited to the enthusiasts, and the driving
rain could not dampen their ardor.
The riding honors of the day were
shared by R. M. Tobin and Frank Skin
ner, each piloting two winners. Of the
owners Rudolph Spreckels proved the
most successful, three of his ponies fin
ishing In front.
The real disappointment of the day
was the failure of W. S. Hobart to start
his great pony Silver Dick. The cham
pion quarter-horse was at the track
and was fit to race, but his owner took
exception to Frank Skinner, who was
carded to ride Rudolph Spreckels'
Becky, the most dangerous rival to Sil
ver Dick. The illness of Lawrence Mc-
Creery, who rode Silver Dick at Mon
terey, deprived Mr. Hobart of his valu
able services. Mr. Hobart's objection
to Mr. Skinner was a purely personal
one and dates back some years to a
time when they were the best two race"
riders of the coast among the gentlemen
sportsmen. There was a dispute over a
cup race and the breach was never
healed.

As events transpired Searcher showed
to be about an hour and thirty minutes
the best of the nine starters in the mile
selling affair. The old gelding closed a
mild favorite, moved toward the front
by degrees from eighth position and
then sauntered in first by half a dozen
lengths. Charley Connell rode a vigor
ous race on the 15 to 1 chance North
west, downing Tamm two lengths for
the place. Rio Shannon was fourth.
Probably the distance of the fifth
six furlongsâ was a trifle too short for
the favorite, Silurian, but for all that
the Lamasney entry would have won
with any sort of fair racing luck. The
field of seven ran well bunched the en
tire route. Three-sixteenths from home,
as Travers was moving through the
bunch with Silurian, he was cut off.
Again, less than a furlong from the
wire, Martin, astride Skip Me, swerved
in front of him, compelling his complete
retirement. Lady Kent. 3% to 1 in the
ring and well ridden by Holbrook, dis
posed of the 8 to 1 shot Toto Gratlot
by half a length. "Big Bill" Knapp fin
ished third with Cloche d'Or.
NOTES OF THE TRACK.
Nothing would have been more ap
propriate than to see Pat Morrlssey
win the mile and 100 yard selling num
ber. Two-thirds of the handicappers
made the old fellow their triple X spe
cial, and 6 to 5 was the closing quota
tion. It looked powerful good for Pat
as he swung into the stretch first, but
age will tell. Below the paddock gate
Travers drove ujp with The Fretter,
and In a driving finish got the decision
by a head. Moor, an outsider, was
third.
Tommy Lottridge's Gateway, with
S9 pounds up, opened a pronounced
favorite for the opening mile run. Later
in the betting 3Â»Â£ to 1 could be had.
The winner turned up in Dusty Miller,
a 6 to 1 shot, on which Travers took
the lead on the back stretch and won
cleverly at the wire by a couple of
lengths. Crosswalte did not get away
any too well with Gateway, and then
took the place without much effort
from Lady Atheling.
If J. T. Sheehan had made less use
of his whip on Marie J in the two-year
old scramble-the filly might have been
returned a winner. Leading Abba into
the stretch by a couple of lengths,
Sheehan drew his persuader,, and In
doing so, of course, turned his mount's
head loose, finishing third. Light of
Day, backed down to favoritism under
a highly refined play and carefully rid
den by Buxton, led Hooligan out half
a length. The latter ran an excellent
race, and will soon be decorated with
a set of brackets.
SEARCHER IS BEST.
It rained cats and dogs; the down
pour made the grass on the lawns and
adjacent hills as green as green could
be; the band at Oakland track dis
coursed patriotic Irish airs yesterday,
the sons of Erin present backed ; Pat
Morrlssey off the boards to win his race
and The Pretter beat Pat out a head.
So the Russians and Japs are not alone
In their troubles.
Otherwise St. .Patrick's' day at the
races was no different from any other
day. The attendance was good despite
the inclemency of the weather and
three favorites paraded past the judges
first.
TheSt Patrick's day purse was re
served for the afterpiece, for which
there were six starters. Hagerdon
looked the natural favorite. His ad
mirers held their money off for a time
and the odds drifted back from 2 to 3.
Then a scramble was made to climb
aboard and the Frank sprinter went to
the post an 8 tp 5 chance. Jack Martin
got him away first and he made a cat
hop of It, beating Albula two open
lengths. Daisy Green nosed out Olym
pian for show honors.

Without a moment's hesitancy the
amusing fellow kicked over the box
and spilled its contents, whereupon

which his joke had been received, Gus
did not discard his mania for fun, but
playfully swatted Mr. Alves on the jaw
with such force as to knock him down.
"Gus, you certainly are a cut-up,"
said the court after the foregoing facts
had been unfolded,' "and all that seems

Judge Seawell also made an ord^r
granting Bessie a new trial
of the suit for annulment of marriage
brought against her by George Rosen
berg, father of H. Rosenberg, the
young man who married her with the
expectation of receiving a large dow
ry from her aunt, Mrs. Goldstein. The
marriage was annulled by Judge Sea
well some months ago, his order of
yesterday being made on the repre
sentation of the defendant that she
had neu r evidence.
Edward Clarke, the capitalist, must
support Rosalind Clarke, the "sweet
pea girl," perjding the determination
of his suit for the annulment bi the
marriage he claims he was entrapped
into by the young lady, who acquired
considerable notoriety when Durrant
was on trial for his life for mur
dering Blanche Lamont. He must
also give her the money to pay the
lawyers she has retained to defend
her against the charges made by himl
Judge Seawell yesterday made an or
der directing Clarke to pay her $100
forthwith and $1 00 on the first Mon
day of every month until the suit ia
determined, and 5500 for counsel
fees. The order concerning counsel
fees as made by the court is not pre
judicial to another application for
more money for a similar purpose.
Neither is the order of Judge Seawell
denying (Mrs. Clarke $500 for costs of
court prejudicial to a new application.
that has charge of the preliminary
work, said; yesterday that the com
mittee has decided to hold a meeting
early next week to consider by-laws
and a general plan for a better organ
ization than has so far been attained.
All commercial bodies, all social clubs
and organizations that wi?h to be rep
resented Will have the opportunity }o
select members of the new body. -viV
The executive branch of the present
committee favors giving the entire
community a chance to work, for the
common good. -According to present
expectations, Architect Burnham, Mr.
St. Gaudens and Mr. Mosby, landscape
artists, will visit San Francisco in May.
They will prepare plans which, it Is
hoped, will provide for the needs of
San Francisco in the matter of beau
titlcation architecturally and otherwise
for many years.
The committee has received a com
munication from Mrs. M. L. Lansing
Sr., making various suggestions that
are pleasing. Many other communica
tions have been received.
Â¦ Burnham is now in .Balti
more, where he is planning for the re
building of the burned area of the city
on lines of beauty and utility. ' Mr.
Harrison says that the executive com
mittee for San Francisco believes that
the Board of Supervisors will appro
priate the money that is needed for
the preliminary work in behalf of this
city. Probably the meeting to form a
great local organization will be held
next Wednesday in the rooms of the
Merchants'- Association.
In the work of providing for a more
beautiful San Francisco all organiza
tions and individuals having an Inter
est in the city will have a chance to
take part. William Greer Harrison,
a member of the executive committee
"In the Mexican consular service,"
said he, "the San Francisco port is
rated as very important, in that it Is
near the home office and has a high
standing In the commercial world. For
that reason mainly I feel proud that
I have been selected by our President
for the position that has recently been
vacated. President Diaz is a strong
believer in the United States and no
one in Mexico has a higher regard for
your citizens than he, a fact that he
has often demonstrated, as Americans
in Mexico will readily testify to. In
paying my farewell call en President
Diaz he referred to the friendship that
exists between Mexico and the United
States, and expressed a hope that I
would bear this fact In mind and in
every possible way strengthen the
bonds of good feelimj between the two
nations. It is my hope that I will suc
e'eed in this direction here and other
wise show by my official acts that con
fidence has been Justly reposed -in me
by our President."
Consul General Romero expects to
enter upon his duties in a few days, as
soon as he receives his exequatur from
Washington. He declined yesterday to
discuss the affairs of his predecessor.
He stated that he had been requested
to accept the local position by Presi
dent Diaz and hoped to perform his
duties in a manner that will not only
receive approval from his Government,
but the support of those of his country
men who live here.
Cayetano Romero, the newly ap
pointed Mexican Consul General to San
Francisco, arrived from the southern
republic yesterday and is registered
at the Occidental Hotel. Mr. Rcrmero
is a brother of the late Matias Ro
mero, at one 'time Mexican Minister
to Washington, and has himself served
In various capacities in the diplomatic
service, having been formerly Charge
d'Affaires at -Washington and later the
Mexican Minister to the republics of
Central America, with headquarters in
the city of Guatemala. He comes to
San Francisco as the successor of Ra
fael de Zayas Enriquez, who served
here only a few months and then hur
riedly departed from the city, leaving
anything but a favorable impression
Â¦behind him among the members of the
Mexican colony. Consul General Enri
quez was sent to San Francisco to suc
ceed E. K. Coney, and, being a consti
tutional lawyer and a statesman of
considerable note in his own country,
it was expected that he would make
a splendid representative for his coun
try at this port. Unfortunately, how
ever, the Mexicans of the city soon
learned to regard the Consul General
as an aristocrat and showed him scant
courtesy, which fact, together with
financial troubles that followed his as
sumption of duties here, soon disgusted
Senor Enriquez, and one day he quietly
took his departure from San Francisco
and returned to Mexico. The consulate
has since remained in charge of a "sec
retary.
Judge Coffey's refusal to enter Into
the compromise plan effectually ties up
the fortune of the Moxeys unless the
attorneys in the case take the matter
to the Supreme Court and secure a re
versal of his order- The attorneys
claim that the compromise plan as pro-,
posed was simply the result of a de
tlre to eave the estate from the "cost of
expensive litigation-
Thus It may bÂ« Â«ecn that not onrjr is the
welfare Â«f the incotni>etent involved, - but the
Central interest* of the community of which
the is a cotni>onent part. The court had
found that Mm. Phil!ipÂ»-Moxey was incompe
tent and that Moorer and Moxey had practiced
fraud upon her in irany and de\'lou* ways, if
tbÂ«eÂ«r finding* were based upon facts they
could Dot be destroyed by a f-tlpulatson which
rave a large portion of the loot to one of the
implicated parties. The court could not n?.ake
tteelt Â» party to a compromise of conduct in
ftcted wÂ»tn moral turpitude. If the findings
and Judrmer.t were Â¦ erroneous they should be
etwallc-d in th* mode prescribed by statute and
nÂ»rt 6*t efide In a summary manner. Even if
the court wer* no inclined. It doubts its power
to act on p. Fti;>tilation signed by a guardian
of an incompetent to give away her property
to a person who ha* secured an advantage by
fraud. It ia certainly a question whether a
ruardias can *o rtlpulate away his ward's
rUhts.
The proposed compromise with Moxey
does not meet with the approval of
Judge Coffey, who when the stipulation
consenting to the new trial was offered
to him for his signature took but little
pains to hide his disgust. He said he
doubted the right of Mandeville to
compromise with Moxey, saying that
in his opinion such an action consti
tuted a summary setting aside of the
court's findings and a practical giving
up to one found guilty of fraud of a
portion of the estate of a person for
whom the court's aid had been sought.
At the close of the proceeding Judge
Coffey said:
To tign an order predicated on such a stip
ulation would not only l>e a Judicial self-stul
tification, a fal*ifyUÂ« by the court of its own
finding* and solemn judenwot, but Jt would
be prejudicial to public i>olicy, for it ia not
a mere matter of private concern, but one in
which the community U interested in the pre
vention of wrong to citlxene and the conserva
tion of the riKht* of person* and property. The
public ends to be served are the protection of
property, the prevention of fraud, the restitu
tion of estate fraudulently acquired by *po-
Ilatora and the providing asa'.nvt the incur
ment of a public charge in consequence of im
providence Inducing indlrence.
TIES UP ESTATE.
Moxey would net about $15 r 000 by this
arrangement, as under the compromise
he must pay the coet of his wife's de
fense to Mandeville's charges of incom
petency. It is estimated that this will
amount to about $20,000.
The terms '>f the compromise at.
tempted to be made by Mandeville with
Moxey at the close of the sensational
trial were made public in the probate
court yesterday, when the guardianship
matter came uz> on a motion for a new
trial, made by Moxey. A stipulation
agreeing to a new trial and confirming
the compromise was filed by the attor
neys in the case, but the motion was
denied by Judge Coffey after it had
been stated that Moxey had agreed to
accept SO .per cent of the value of the
property conveyed to him by his aged
spouse and to reconvey the property
to D. K. and L. H. Phillips of Boston,
his brothers-in-law, to be held by them
in trust for Mrs. Moxey. Judge Coffey
refused to grant the motion, # which
would have the effect of restoring Mrs.
Moxey to competency and thus set
aside his own judgment-
COURT DISAPPROVES.
Oliver N. Moxey, the fencing master
of John D. Hoover's "University" of
Physical Culture, who persuaded aged
and inuomrietent Mrs. Gage H. Phillips
of Boston to become his wife and then
Induced her to deed to him property in
Boston worth $125,000" and a ranch in
Mendocino County worth $20,000, will be
about Jl&.OOO richer than he was before
he met the aged woman and by his soft
words and subtle flattery won her heart
and hand, provided the attorney*! In the
case and Harry Mandeville have their
way.

Pit Gem Mail Clipper
KEEPS THE NAILS IN SPLENDID TRIM.
j The "Care of the' Nails" is a subject in which every one should be interested, for it is rightly
taken as an open index of good breeding and character. Laxity in the care of the nails indicates
slovenliness. Perfect grooming of the nails is often an important element in a favorable decision
when applying for a business position.
< A simple manicuring should be given the nails at least once a week. The cuticle should be
pushed back with a fiat pointed (oar-shaped) orange stick. Soak the nails :n a bowl of warm,
soapy water for five minutes. Then cut the nails the proper shape, being careful to remove all hang-
nails. File carefully and rub in some cold cream or vaseline; this will prevent brittleness. Re-
move it with a cloth and apply some manicure powder; rub briskly with a chamois polisher,
too high a polish is considered bad form. â¢ â¢
The almond shaping is preferred; oval at the delicate finger-tips and short, at the sides.
This cutting and shaping of the nails can be perfectly done with The Gem Nail Clipper, a complete
manicure set. For sale everywhere at 25c.
â¢ !, INSTRUCTIONS HOW TO USE-
I GEM NAIL CLIPPER -^, 1
To 'use. the Clipper press down firmly on the lever and release the lock by turning the
star. In using the Clipper always keep the lower jaw against the end of the finger, and, by sim-
! ply changing the angle of presentation, cut the nail short or trim as desired.
"The Gem" Nail dipper
TRIMS THE HAHS AJtY DESIRED LENGTH AND SIZE

\ The Gem Nail Clipper is made from a high grade of tool steel, neatly finished in nickel;
! is less than two inches in length, and has no sharp corners to wear the pocket. The jaws are
j hardened and ground accurately. With proper care one will last several years.
After practical and thorough tests, made by disinterested parties, it has been demonstrated
! that "The Gem" is the best Clipper upon the market. y
POINTS FOR ATTENTION . '

i and ground. With ordinary care one will last for years.

| dinary cutting plyer, it makes a good clean cut and does not tear or pull.
i j THIRDâ The jaws are so constructed that one may trim the nail to any desired length or
| shape.
I FOURTH â It is a perfect tool for removing hangnails.

It was "the old ' woman" who first read In
the smiles of their fellow-passengers that her
husband's fears were groundless, and .. when
Captain Thomas said. "Let go that line," and
yanked the engine-room telejrraph It was she
who persuaded the old man to take a chance
and stay with the ship.
"U'r a-rainin*. mister. Them chimneys o'
yourn is catchln* a heap o" water. First thing
ye know, out goes your flres. and. I've run
threshing machines long enough to know what
happens to a inglne .when the fire goes out.
Â¦Wait till the rain stops or put me an* the old
woman back on the pier."
An aged oouple delayed the sailing of the
steamship State of California yesterday for
some minutes. The lines were cast off and the
vessel started Ftreamward, when an old man
with fiowinjt white beard rushed to the bridge
and demanded that he and his wife be set
ashore.
'â¢Hitch up to the pier again, captain. Me
and the old woman ain't a-goin'.V
Not knowing how serious the old man's
necessity might be. Captain Thomas passed a
hawser to the wharf and held on while the
passenger stated his case.
"Why don't you want to go?" asked the
eUIpper.

The Pacific Mail Company's steam
ship Colon, from Panama and way
ports, was off the heads early yester
day morning, but did not venture in
until after sundown, too late for quar
antine inspection. She anchored off
Angel Island and will be passed'by the
Federal health authorities first thing
this morning.
The steamers Pacific and Alitak and
the ship Eclipse of the Alaska Packers'
Association started for sea, but re

If the weather moderates they will get

Although the waters of the bay were
comparatively smooth yesterday,, a
howling gale was raging at the very
portals of the Golden Gate. Few ves
sels came into port and those that
started for sea turned back when they
got a taste of the quality of the weath
er outside. The pilot boats Gracie S
and America, under closely reefed sail,
found their regular station too stormy
and cruised the greater part of the
day in the quieter waters in the vicin
ity of Fort Point. When the weather
is too vigorous for these stanch little
craft sailormen begin to take notice
and regard with wholesome respect the
gale that chases to cover' the pilot
schooners.

the latter's ground by the score of 13
to 4.
Berkeley Defeats Santa Clara.
"WASHINGTON, March 1?.âSecre
tary Taft to-day continued his discus
sion of Philippine matters before the
House Committee on Insular Affairs.
He suggested an amendment to the
coinage law, so as to authorize the
Philippine Treasury to issue sliver cer
tificates in denominations of 2. 6, 10.
20, 50, 100, 500 and 1000 pesos, instead of
denominations of from 2 to 10 pesos.
He also advocated the repeal of the
tonnage tax on vessels arriving at Ma
nila, to encourage the landing of large
steamers from San Francisco, Hong
kong and Singapore. Â¦
Taking up the railroad feature of the
Cooper bill, which guarantees 4 per
cent on an investment of $40,000,000 in
railroads in the islands, the Secretary
said he visited New York last week, and
had been assured by capitalists there
that they would go into the enterprise
if the Government would insure a cer
tain income on the investment.
In the evening Sacramento Company
5, Oakland 11, San Francisco 3, Stock
ton 12, .Vallejo 10 and Golden West 13,
uniform rank, under command of Major
Montgomery, and. preceded by Oak
land's brass band, escorted the su
preme commander to Golden Gate Hall,
where he was tendered a reception by
the members of the order in this city
and vicinity. There were abouts SOO sir
knights present. The stage was occu
pied by the guest of the evening, Past
Grand Commander H. L. Tickner. State
Commander S. W. Hall; J. C. Sharp,
chairman of the evening; Dr." J. E.
Thompson, Theo Frolich of San Fran
cisco Tent. J. L- Fine of Oakland, A.

Lieutenant G. V. Leroi. After an or
chestral selection J. C. Sharp delivered
an address of welcome, which was fol
lowed by selections by the Maccabee
band, specialties by "Billy" Hynes.
violin solo by Miss Adele Weilsch, se
lections by the Maccabee Zither and
Mandolin Club, an interesting and log
ical address on the order by the su
preme commander'and Southern melo
dies by the Alabama quartet.
Wednesday Lillian M. Hollister, su
preme commander of the Ladies of the
Maccabees, opened a school of instruc
tion in Pioneer Hall for the benefit of
the officers of the local hives and those
in the bay counties.
In the evening there was initiatory
work in the presence of a large number
of- members of the order. Twenty-five
hives were represented and were wit
ness of the new ritualistic work, exem
plified with fifty candidates by a spe
cial team. The work was followed by a
programme of entertainment and the
serving of a collation.
Lieutenant George V. Leroi was the
toastmaster, and between courses
called on a number of the 150 who
were seated at the festal board to say
something for the good of the order
without assigning any particular sub
ject, believing from oast experience
that those selected to speak at ban
quets never talk on the subject as
signed to them. The following
named were called u^on: J. C. Sharp
of Golden "West Tent, chairman of
the San Francisco committee; E. K.
Strowbridge of Haywards, James
Boyer of Pacific Tent. J. L- Fine of
Oakland, Major C. E. Montgomery of
Golden West Tent. Dr. P. W. Brown

Tent, Captain Seeley of division 3 of
the uniform rank. William Hammond
of San Jose. D. B. Richards of San
Francisco Tent, R. H. Bosworth of
Berkeley, Commander Harley of Mis
sion Tent, Sir Knight Maddox of St.
Louis, Mo.. Sir Knight E. C. Stock
of Golden West Tent, Judge George H.
Cabaniss of Golden West Tent, Great
Commander S. W. Hall. Past Great
Commander H. L. Tickner and Su
preme Commander Markey, who ex
pressed his appreciation of the hos
pitality extended to him during his
stay in California.
Wednesday morning the reception
committee of the local Knights of the
Maccabees took Supreme Commander
D. P. Markey and party in charge and
in automobiles took them to all points
of interest in and around the city, then
to the Presidio, the park and the cliff,
after which they were served luncheon
down town.
Last evening the supreme com
mander was the guest of honor at a
banquet in the California Hotel, ten
dered him by the San Francisco com
mittee. There were present a number
of members of the order from tents
on the other side of the bay.
The Alameda County committee
having charge- of entertaining Su
preme Commander D. P. Markey of the
Knights of the Maccabees had made
arrangements to take him and his
wife and prominent Maccabees over
the county of Alameda, showing them
the University of California, the
Deaf and Dumb and Blind Asy
lum and other points of interest,
but was unable, on account of the
downpour, to carry out the pro
gramme that had been prepared and
decided to postpone the courtesies un
til a future time.

Sharp Flurry in Mining Stocks,
Led by Savage.
The -mining stocks had the floor yesterday.
Savage,\ which doted en Wednesday at 88c
bid, opened at Â»lc. advanced to $1 2S at noon,
fell back to 62Â« in the afternoon and closed at
64c bid, the decline after the afternoon board
being nmsatlonally rapid. The flurry In the
Hock n-a.Â« ascribed to a change In the director
ate at a special meeting' of the company yes
terday. The resignations of George R. Wells
as director and president and Charles II. Fish
as director and vice president were received
and accepted and Franklin Leonard Jr. was
elected a director and president and Charles
Hlrschfeld a director and vice president to fill
the vacancies. The balance of the board of di
rectors remains unchanred. John W. TwiSKS*
continues secretary and H. M. Gorham super
intendent. Franklin Leonard Jr.. the newly
elected president. Is attorney for the Comstock
Tunnel Company.
The ilurry In Savag* affected the other
stocks and Ophlr eold up to V> SO. Gould A
Curry to f>0c. Consolidated California and Vir
ginia to $2, and so on. The highest prices as
a rule were touched in the afternoon, and the
close was weaker. Confidence levied an assess
ment of 20c.
The business en the Stock and Bond Ex
change was confined chiefly to bonds, which
said very well, but stocks were dull. The only
noteworthy change I was In Gas and Electric,
which.sold from $0!> S2H to $58 75. There was
arale af California-street Railroad at $190 75.
The New York and Honduras Rcsarlo Mlnir.g
Company has declared a monthly dividend of I

CHICAGO March 17.â Liberal rains, in Kan
sas and Oklahoma ga\e the wheat market a
weak start. May opening l%@l!4<r. --off, at
04^-Â«?05c. July was down Â¦ifiTie.'-.s.t 00c.
Commission houses had numerous Â¦'* selling
orders. Small longs had considerable > July^
for sale. There was little desire , to buy. On .
thÂ» way down a good many stop-loss^ordera
for the July option were met; -and .tnÂ» price
dropp*4 to SO^ic. Much Ions: wheat was sola
on the decline, and there were many : sales for ,
short account. Toward the noon hour the raar-j
ktt rallied slightly on covering by early short:;
sellers, and on some buying by ; : longs.:. -.The J,
news of the day, however, was I pessimistic,
and the market at no time showed any great ,
firmness Advices from the Narthvfest were |
decidedly bearish, a report from Minneapolis
ptatinjj that the flour bunlnefi was poorer than
It had been for many months. The decrease
In the milling demand caused another general
selling mnveirent. under which the market
again weakened. Before the decline was
checked July sold off to 8S%c During the last
hour a better demand developed and a firmer
feeling prevailed. July recovered nearly a
cent of th* loss, closing at 80%gÂ«0*ic Final
figures on May were at Â»4%c
Fair BUDDort from some of the ble bull
operators caused a comparatively steady ton*
In corn, notwithstanding the weakness in .
wheat The close was steady and practically
at' last nlxhfs final figures. May closed at
6SUe. July closed a shade higher, at 60%c. |
Weakness In whfat brought out considerable
profit taking In May oats by tired holders,
and ' that delivery ruled easier. May closed

WHEATâ News is very scarce, all the mar
kets of the world being tame and featureless,
Â¦ and Chicago continues the only place where
s there Is any animation. Broomhall cables from
i Liverpool that that market Is somewhat steadier
i' owing to light Argentine shipments and higher
' prices of breadstuffs In Ruscla. At the same
Â¦ time futures were lower. Suppfies of bread
- stuffs afloat for and In store In Europe
j on March 1 ~ were over 10,000,000 bugh
; els more than a year ago. but. add
ing the - stocks In store In Argen
i Una and America, the total supply was some
j 7.UOO.O0O bUBhels less than a year ago. Russia
! and Australia, however, are shipping freely,
i and by the first of April the European coun
: tries will undoubtedly have more on hand than
on the first of March. The Chicago Dally
Trade Bulletin, estimating the last crop in this
country at 675,000,000 bushels, figures that there
was left for export on March 1st 7P.000.000
bushels, whereas the quantity exported after
March 1 last year amounted to but 61,000,000
j bushels.
i In this market futures sympathized with
; Chicago and futures declined, but the cash
market showed no changre.

BARLEY â The situation continues Interest
ing. The May shorts are already looking about
for grain to deliver on their contracts and are
at some loss to find It. Certainly stocks are
not large and the demands upon them of late
have been heavy. Barley taken In on the De
cember deliveries, mentioned yesterday. Is
whittled down to about 500 tons. If reports on
"Change be correct, as 1500 tons more were sold
for Oriental account on Wednesday. The rest of
this Barley has been withdrawn from the mar
ket at present prices. Among Barley brokers
It Is freely said that the supply in the StaU
is less than- previously estimated. The exports
Â¦during the first three months of this year arÂ«
estimated at 50.000 tons. â¢ Â« â¢.
' V The cash Feed continued firm yesterday, but
futures were lower, owing chiefly to the rain.
The loading of the 6000 tons recently bought
for the Orient begins to-day. â¢

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
Trade In Potatoes was Quiet and prices
showed but slight variation from the previous
report. Receipts were light, but there was no
scarcity, as there was a heavy accumulation
of old stock on the wharves and in tire stor?s.
The top quotation for Oregon Burbanka was
shaded, there being nostrlctly fancy stock of
fering. Onions wvre weak afsd lower, with large
lines of poor and growing stock offering, which
had a depressing effect upon choice lots. Aus
tralians were held for shipping at $3 5Oyi per
cental, according to quality. ; -Â¦ :
Trade In .vegetables was fair and nriees of
southern kinds were well maintained, under
light -rectlpte. Arrivals of Asparagus were
lighter than on the preceding day, but as there
was less demand for" shipping prices rangrd
lower. Receipts of Rhubarb were 413 boxes
and tlÂ»e market was weak, but prices were no
lower, as most of the offerings had been pur
chased direct from the growers at the inside
rate, thus necessitating the asking of high
prices. Most dealers, however, were willing: to
clean up at cost..

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
There was an easier feeling In Butter, as the
retailers had filled last week's deficiency an<l
there was more on the market, but quotations
remained unchanged. There was nothing new
In Cheese.
It might as well be understood now that from
this time on for several months there will be
two Important Egg markets close to each other
â one at San Francisco and the other up around
Petaluma and Santa Rosa. Speculators who
want Eggs for cold storage go up Into Sonoma
County and pay above the San Francisco mar
ket to get the Eggs. Sometimes this has no
effect In San Francisco and sometimes It forces
the San Francisco market up above what local
consumers and shippers will pay, and at such
tlmea the loeul dealers have to put their accu
mulated surplus into cold storage for want of
customers. A remembrance -of â¢ this will sare
the country producer and shipper much con
fusion and dissatisfaction from now on, as the
quotations given In this column always repre
sent the San Francisco market.
The Egg market showed little change yester
day, though there were more offering than on
the preceding day.
The trains are now all running as uroal. and
unless _tpI unotli'-'ir sever*? storm receipts of
Butter and Eggs will Increase from now on.
. Receipts were 51.100 lbs Butter, 1621 cases
Eggs and 13,1)00 lbs Cheese.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
' The . prevailing low prices of Oranges con
tinued to attract a certain class of buyers,
and, although the rainy weather exerted a
more 1 or less depressing influence uÂ»n the
market, trade was of moderate volume, ped
dlers being the principal buyers. ' Stacks, how
ever, were still unwieldy, and a large portion
of the offerings of standard Navels were of poor
quality, which -two causes would have beÂ«n
sufficient to Check any advance in prices, even
if the weather had been more favorable. Offer
ings aO v to-day's auction will be lighter than
usual, only five cars being expected. Stocks of
Mexican Limes were very light and prices were
unchanged,- but there was talk of lower quota
tions, fcs a steamer was due with large sup
plies. The Other Citrus fruits were In ample
supply and unchanged. Ripe Bananas were
offering freely and met with a steady Inquiry
at previous prices. Two cars of Central Amer
ican came In.
There was nothing to rtport in Apples.

of * standard and choice grades are extremely
scarce, but of extra choice and fancy there
is understood to be a fair supply on the spot.'
The demand Is chiefly for the lower grades.
Peaches remain very firm with a good demand
and light offerings. There were no fresh de

SALT FISHâ Advices from New Tork say:
"There has been a nharp reduction In price*
on all grades of Bait mackerel, which is at
tributed to the slackness of demand in con
junction with the pressure of quite liberal sup
plies. Norway bloaters offer down to $->-\
while No. 1 and lower grades are to be had
at $2 and $.1 a barrel less than the prices
quoted a week ago. In Irish mackerel the
decline amounts to $2 per barrel, and the
market Is easy at the lower figures. Shore
Is are relatively higher than other grades,
being held at $17(J18. The demand for Scotch
and Holland ' herring has quieted materially,
and prices ar* somewhat nominal. The scar
city In domestic kinds continues, but the sea
son Is about done and prices show no further
change. Cod continues scarce, for while there
has been considerable decline in the price of
fresh fish It is too high still for profitable
salting." ' ~.
CANNED SALMON â The market is consid
erably firmer. Large sales of Alaska pinks
are reported as high as 70c. with holders now
asking 75c. Japan has made several pur
chases amounting to nearly 10(^000 caseÂ«.
Al&ska reds are firmer, and it is now almost
impossible to buy under $1 25.

I which Indicated a betterment in the capacity
of the market. There ' was a crystallization
cf the feeing that a very important clearing
away had been effected by the Supreme Court s
I action of Monday. The action of the foreign
j markets Tia* taken to show a clearing up of
danger oi complication in Europtan politics.
I an<1 althcvch the exchanges abroad were af
! rÂ«-ctÂ»d to-day by the reduction of the short
! interest as cure was, the admitted revival of
| demand in the iron and steel trade Is believed
i to havÂ« had no adequate reflection In the
! stock market. Relief is felt over the news
I that the ecft coal miners will accept the re
! duction of wage*. The breaking of the drouth
! in thp Southwest is encouraging to holders of
I raiirr.ad stocks in that region, and the brÂ«*ak
In wheat, and also in cotton, to-day, were
taken a* promising bÂ«ttT pro5pects for both
i crop*. The professional element in Wall street
! seamed to arrive at a common agreement to
day that fnmÂ» advance in prices was war
ranted by what has been already effected in
j clearing away the clcuds in the situation. The
| net results are gains running from 1 to 2
I points for all the prominent active stocks. St.

ThÂ» bond market showed a broadening tÂ»n

Congressman Gillette has sent the
following communication to Super
visor Braunhart, chairman of the
Public Utilities Committee, relative to
the opposition to the bill designed to
grant water, rights on the Tuolumne
River to the city of San Francisco:
Tours of March 5 at hand, and In reply
will say that I would have no Interest In the
world in opposing San Francisco's deslrÂ» to
get a ' water supply from Tuolumne County,
because it is more Important to have water for
domestic use than for any other purpose. If
it could be shown or if - my constituents could
be assured that they would not be deprived of
water which they need for mining and for
irrigating purposes, it is more than probable
that <no objection would be made to the qrop
osltion. I think the greatest opposition? you
will have will be from the Land DÂ«[wrttfifnt.
I presented the bill, when I flrst received Iti to
the department and found out from them that
the Â¦ matter had been presented before and
that the Secretary of the . Interior was op
posed to it. Under the law and Â¦' rales you
will have to obtain his advice and approval,
and if you Â¦ secure that I suppose you would
probably have no trouble. Mr. Needham's con
stituents would be more directly affected by
the bill than mine, and ' I think he would be

Department Will Object to the

his younger manhood, but between Dr

need had passed.
The story of hardship and struggle
was prefaced by an interesting ac
count of the first ascent, made in 1865
by the most famous of all mountain
climbers. Edward Whymper, the Lon
don newspaper reporter, who had defied
the superstitions of the Swiss that the
Matterhorn was not a mountain at all
but a thing of magic, whose top was
Inhabited by divers evil spirits, among
them the Wandering Jew, who hurled j
rocks down upon all foolhardy climb

small number of tourists each year had
reached the top. among these being
four or five women.

An affidavit full of charges against
Dr. Aimer F. Veale, former special
administrator of the" estate of James
D. Taylor, was filed yesterday by
?Charles E. Naylor, attorney for Bee
Taylor, administratrix of the estate.
The affidavit Is filed in connection
with Veale'e motion to set aside the
court's approval of his final account,
in order that he might present a claim
against the estate for pay for his ser
vices. Xaylor charges that Veale, in
order . to get control of the estate,
misrepresented the facts to the court
and that he betrayed his trust by
turning over to the security company
which furnished him bonds stocks
and other securities that came into his
hands upon the death of Taylor. Be
cause of the* alleged misconduct of
Veale, sayÂ» Xaylor, he is not entitled
to pay.

Representatives of the various Im
provement clubs appeared before the
Board of Public 1 Works yesterday to
express their preference for needed
street improvements in their respec
tive districts, provision for which may
be made in the next municipal budget
The Board of Works expressed itself
in sympathy with the improvements
designated, but explained that its pow
er extended only so , far as to make
the recommendations therefor to the
Board of Supervisors, who made the
neeessary appropriations covering mu
nicipal expenditures. The Board of
Works agreed to make the recommen
dations indicated by the petitions of
the improvement clubs. ;
G. Roundy, A. B. Magulre and R.
Pease of the Mission Improvement
Clubs asked that Mission street from
Crescent avenue to Silver avenue and
from Onondaga avenue to the county
line be bituminized, as the roadway
in its present condition is Impassable.
They also advocated the bitumlnizlng
of "Valencia street from Eighteenth to
Twenty-eighth.
R. C. Clark and B. C. Joost of the
Market Street and Eureka Valley Im
provement Club petitioned for the
opening of Market street from Seven
teenth street to the ocean. Joost said
that the improvement had been agir
tated as far back as 1876, when a map
thereon had been prepared, which, he
submitted to the board. Another map
was made in 1892.-
C. L.. Butte cf the West of Castro
Street Improvement Club asked* that
Hoffman avenue be extended so as to (
make access for fire engines easy tq
the surrounding district, and L. Hack
ett of the same club spoke of the neces
sity for improving the. roadway of View
avenue from Twenty-first to Twenty
fourth streets on account of its impas
sable condition.
G.' L.;Baum, E. McGinley, J. T. Terry
and T.V J. Cassidy of the Point Lobos
Avenue Improvement Club urged the
bitumihizlng of Point Lobos avenue
for Qts entire' width and length, and
the.< recommendation for the same will
be-made by.the Board of Works.
The board appointed Drs. Harvey and
Stinson' a committee to look into the
matter of ventilation of new buildings,
it having 'been discovered that the or
dinance relating: thereto is being: vio
lated. ' ~
\ The board condemned the cellars of
premises numbered from 709 to 751 1 / g
Sacramento street and ordered them to
be torn out and placed in sanitary con
dition. ; : -
Drs. A. E.' Scott and H. D. Power
were appointed "consulting physicians at
the Almshouse. ;F. -P.;Curran was ap
pointed night watchman;
The ;board adopted the rules and reg
ulations formulated by City Physician
Beatrice M.Hlnkle.M.D., for the pro
posed system" of sanitary inspection by
the trained district nurses. . These will
aid the; Inspecting physicians in the im
provement -of ' sanitary .conditions, the
system being in successful operation in
Now York City.' â¢ .
Dr. W. â¢ J. Williams -.was appointed
resjdent physician at the Pesthouse at
a salary, of $150 per month.
The raising of the percentage of but
ter fats Is. in accordance with the de
sire of Mayor Schmitz, it having been
found that, the Infant mortality has
been sensibly decreased in New York'
by the adoption of the higher rate.
The board ratified the appointment of
Dr. W. M/ Lawlor as receiving secre
tary at. the City and Hospital
at a salary of $100 per month. Lawlor
succeeds R. Ehrlich, who was appointed
January 9 last when the board assumed
office.
"The plan, in brief, is to visit the pub
lic schools of the city and make a class
room Inspection with the idea of de
tecting the presence of disease in the
early part of the incubative stages in
cases of contagious or Infectious dis
eases, and to detect the presence of
chronic conditions which have escaped
the observation of the parents. The
object- gained Is Intende'd to be the
early arrest of the spread of contagion
in the schools and the reference of thea;
acute and chronic cases to the family
physicians of these children. Dally
or weekly reports complying, with cer
tain printed forms will be required in
order to tabulate the proper. results of
this inspection."
The board adopted Health Officer
Ragan's recommendation that inspec
tions and analyses of all milk supplle-J
by dairies to householders be made reg
ularly twice each month. The board
also raised the standard of butter fata
in milk from 3.2 per , cent to 3.5 per
cent, owing to the fact that adultera
tions have become very frequent. The
bi-monthly bacteriological "inspections
will be made because formalin Is still
being used by some unscrupulous deal
ers to preserve milk. â¢*;.
To that end the board has been in
communication with a number of phy
sicians who have signified their willing
ness to make daily inspections in the
various schools. A letter was ordered
to be sent to, the physicians who have
volunteered their services in that con
riection. The letter says:
The Board of Health decided yester
day to put into effect on April 1 its
proposed system of inspection of the
health conditions among the pupils of
the public school department. At a
recent conference the co-operation of
the Board of Education was assured In
the taking of precautions against the
dissemination of certain diseases by
contact of pupils.
Evershed admits having robbed his
former employer in Fresno and says
that Collins had nothing to do with
the thefts, but was merely assisting
him to dispose of the stolen goods.
Evershed's father is a respected
citizen of Brighton. He is very
wealthy, having a large jewelry and
cutlery factory, in addition to four
wholesale and retail jewelry stores.
The youth worked for Warner In
Fresno for four months and claims to
have learned the business with his
father in England. He came to Cali
fornia last October and is but 17 years
old. A large number of keys were
found on his person and the police be
lieve that he and j Collins intended
burglarizing hotel rooms.
Collins claims to hail from Henri
etta, Texas, and says he owns a bot
tling establishment there. He is 23
years old.
A boy and a young man were ar
ijtsted last night by Police Officers
Huyden and Rheil for having stolen
goods in their possession. The pris
oners gave their names as Vivian C.
Evershed and Robert B. Collins. Ever
shed, who is the younger, is the son
of A. Evershed, a wealthy jewelry and
cutlery manufacturer of 121 Church
road and 52 Western road, Brighton,
England.
Evershed confessed that he ' had
stolen jewelry and various other
articles found in the possession of
himself and Collins from a Jeweler
named H. C. "Warner of Fresno, by
whom .he was employed up to a -week
ago. The entire value of the goods is
in the neighborhood of $250.
Evershed arrived in town in com
pany with Collins, whom, he says, he
met on a Stockton boat. The two were
caught yesterday while in the act of
disposing of some of the stolen jewelry
to M. Stein, who conducts the Royal
Clothing. Parlors at 114 Ellis street.
Stein was seAi by the officers coming
from the room of the thieves in the
Auburney House at 118% Ellis street.
He had just made a trade, giving
young Evershed a fine $30 suit for
stolen property valued at over $50.
The officers became suspicious and
halted Stein, who told them where he
had gotten the stuff.
Evershed and Collins were arrested
in their room and when their effects
were searched an immense amount of
cheap toilet articles, match boxes, two
silver watches and some jewelry,
among which was a gold locket con
taining a small diamond, were found.
The prisoners were taken to the City
Prison and their names placed on the
detinue book.
Suit was brought in the Justices'
Court yesterday by Mrs. Amerique B.
Deussing against Marion Griffin, a
dealer in lodging-houses, to recover the
sum of $110. In her complaint Mrs.
Deussing alleges that Griffin agreed to
secure a purchaser for the former's
lodging-house, at 579 O'Farrell street,
and under the contract was to receive
5 per cent of the price for which it
would be sold.
Griffin secured a purchaser for $3800
and accepted from him a deposit there
on in the sum of $300. The remaining
$3500 was paid to Mrs. Deussing, who
thereupon demanded the sum of $110
from Griffin, that being the difference
between the desposlt of $300 collected
by him and $190, the commission to
which he is entitled under the terms of
the agreement. Griffin has since re
fused to pay the $110.
Lodging-House Keeper Alleges That
Dealer Retained More Than His
Alleged Commission.

more inclined to oppose It. and. being 1 a mem

he would be In a position to oppose it success
fully if It appeared that the bill would be in
jurious to the Interests of his people. What
Mr. Llverrash will have to do, first, will bÂ«
to get a favorable report from the Secretary
of the Interior and from the director of thÂ»
Geological Survey, because If they report on it
adversely his bill can never pass. This is
what I set out to do at the very outset be
fore I received protests from my constitu

the director rf the Geological Survey that I
might be able to accomplish something, but,

"Our force is entirely too small to j
efficiently handle the police work of
this city. A- conservative estimate of
the population is 425,000, besides a great
jiumber of people who are in business
here and reside in suburban towns, in
addition to the large floating, popula
tion. Your attention is called to the
'penny-wise-pound-foolish 1 system of
paying large rentals for police stations
when the necessary land is available
for the erection of buildings by the
city."
The statement continues
To save rentals of $4084 for police
Stations Wl(,tman petitions that new j
stations be built for Golden Gate Park
at a cost of $25,000. North End for
$20,000, Potrero for $25,000 and Ocean
View for $6000. j
"Wittman also recommends that an I
appropriation of $3600 be made to em- j
ploy two carpenters and a painter, thus :
doing away with the necessity of de
tailing regular officers on this work. {
Chief of Police Wittman filed a state
ment with the Board of Supervisors
yesterday to the effect that the sum
of $900,616 will be required to pay sal
aries of policemen and other attaches
of the Police Department during the
next fiscal year. In addition to this
amount, the police patrol will require
$22,505 and miscellaneous expenses will
eat up $18,950 more. At present there
are 575 patrolmen on the force besides
the commissioned officers.
Wittman asks for funds to pay addi
tional officers on the force, as follows:
One captain, of police, at $2400 per
year; two lieutenants of police, $3360;
ten detective sergeants, $18,000; five pa
trol sergeants, $7500; four corporals,
$5616, and 200 additional patrolmen,
$244,880. He also asks that a new rank
be created in the department between
the Chief of Police and the captains
to be known as "Inspector of Police,"
who would act as assistant to the Chief
and take his place during his absence,
the salary of the position to be $3240
yearly.

" I herewith wrltÂ« oat in fall the be-
ginning and end of that terrible disease,
eczema, which caused my babe untold
suffering and mjself many sleepless'
nights.
"My babe was born seemingly a fair,
healthy child, bat when she was three,
weeks old. a swelling appeared on the
back of her head, and in coarse of time
broke. It did not heal bat grew worse,
and the sore spread from the size of a
dime to that of a dollar. I used all
kinds of remedies that I could think of,*.
bat nothing seemed to help ; in fact, it
grew worse. Her hair fell oat where
the sore was, and I feared It would never '.
grow again. It continued nntll my aged
father came on a visit, and .when ha
taw the baby he told me to get Cati-
cura Soap and Ointment right away.'
" To please him I did 00, and to my
surprise by their use the sora began to
heal over, the hair grew orer it, and
to-day she has a nice head of hair, her.
skin Is as fair as a Uly, and she has no
scar left to recall that awful sore, and
it is over eight months and no sign of
Its returning."
Mrs. Wm. Rter, Elk River, Minn.
â¢â¢Cure permanent." So writes Mrs.
Ryer. Feb. 26, 1908, six years later:
Â¦ â¢â¢ Tour letter of the 19th inst. received,
aakiug in regard to the care of my baby""
some six years ago. Well, the disease
has never returned to her head which at
that time was a solid sere ; on top and
down the back. Once or twice slate
then a pitch has come on her hand near:
the wrist, bat it finally disappeared
after proper treatment with Cnticnra.7
