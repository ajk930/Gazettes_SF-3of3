OMAHA, Neb.. April 30.â Miss Mac
Catherine Wood, who yesterday filed a.
<lamage suit for $35,000 against William
: Loeb, secretary to President Roosevelt.
Robert J. Wynne and J. Martin Miller,
to-night talked to a representative of
the press of the events which led up to
the filing of the suit. The case has to
do withw ith certain letters of Senator T.
C. Platt. written to Miss Wood, in
5 which,! it is alleged, he spoke of their
. future | marriage. Miss Wood charges
the defendants in the suit -with having
illegally taken the letters from her.
She wjs a: ked in what particular
Secretary Loeb was connected with the
j matter. | She" declined to answer the
-question directly, but said:
"Secretary Loeb should always use
the telegraph or a courier. It is are
markatJe fact that he knows so little I
of the affair.' Really I think I shall,
have to refrain from going into the de- '
tails until I shall tell it in court."
She Siid she has. not the slightest
idea wtyu any of the defendants would
do, or whether they would accept or
avoid service in I'ne suit. She answer
ed, hovtever, that if Secretary Loeb
avoided} service she would have the
*uit transferred to the United States
courts. J She admitted that she had
never fifcen Loob and that she knew of
no reason why he should * take any
part injthe New York affair, but still
refused] to say in what manner she
; would (fonnect him with it_ lj
Miss fVVood recited over ajrain the
allegations . contained in her oetition
filed inj the "\u25a0 District Court. She spoke
in detail of the alleged relations with
Senators Platt. and closed the interview
with this Bignilicant remark:
'They were looking for scandal, and
i now they have it. I shall show my
hand when the proper time comes."

\u25a0 Who was recently appointed to a posi
tion in the consular service.
When the morning newspapers ar
rived, giving a detailed account of the
â¢ filing of the damage suit. Loeb read
the story carefully and remarked:
"It is just as I thought. . I will have
; to get a bill of particulars to tell how
I am connected with the case." . .
Loeb said to-day: "The only knowl
edge I have of Miss Wood is in rela
tion to her position in the Postofflce
Department and the notoriety she
I'lirougtt to herself Just prior to the
marriage of Senator Platt o ! New
\u25a0 York. She called up- the White House
and asked if she could see me. As
.sistari Secretary Barnes talked with
her and as her business did not seem
to be important, I declined to see her.
Thaf is all I know personally of the
,-woiaaa. lam at a loss as to where she
connects my name^with an application
for damages."

.WASHINGTON; April :3i>.â With" little

Congress,*;, administration officials give
every* evidence of .planning .to recom- â¢
rrierid saddltional'^jnternal'.taxation5 addltional'^jnternal'. taxation to
meet .the dangerous situation resulting
from, the growing deficit.
\u25a0The- first; ten : months- of the fiscal
year; ended 1 ; yesterday r.wlth an excess
of expenditures over receipts of $34,000,
000. The deficit for April alone was
$9,238,818. Secretary. Shaw " and other
treasury > officials expect an excess of
receipts over expenditures 'In May and
June, and the general opinion in the
Treasury Department Is that the de
ficit at the end of the year- win not be
more than $26,000,000. Secretary ' Shaw,
however, would not be surprised 'if it '
reached $30,000,000 or . more. - ; V
The problem of the deficit is .one of
great * seriousness for the. administra
tion ; and will be one ot -" the - q lestlons
most V prominent in official discussion
as soon as President Roosevelt returns
from the West. The cash balance in
the treasury has declined to 5134191.T77.
This includes the amount held iby , na
tional bank depositories, on which Sec
retary Shaw has already, draivn for
$20,000,000. This balance 'is regafded as
.below the point of absGlutejsafety, and
the Government housekeeping seems to
need a vlEorous ; overhauling. '. j
Some of: the revenue taxes abolished
at the close of the ''Spanish. war >will be
applied again, and there seems to be 'a
disposition' to ' recommend *. the . b*er_ tax
that was in force when.it wasjneces
sary to raise ; additional^revefaue to,

and Boundary Question.
ROME, April 30.â The Vatican has
received from Mgr. Sbarretti, the
apostolic delegate at Ottawa, a full
report concerning- his 3iieged inter
ference in the Manitoba boundary
extension. Mgr. Sbarretti "gives ~. the
most detailed particulars of the v.-hole
affair, denying emphatically that hÂ«
had any -understanding with Premier
Laurier or other members of the
Canadian Government to have -the
Catholic school question connected
with the extension of the boundaries

Thy- m<?n went into the shaft at mid
night. Foreman . William Ray of the
Ehift that left the mine at that hour
Elates that the mine was in good con- '
dition and a gas explosion was hardly
probable. His shift left a shot hanging,
n hicli the new shift may have fired.
II is j&ggested from the force of the.
Explosion, which could be heard for
milee around and which tore heavy
timber* aside and piled tons of dirt
into the shaft, that a bad shot had set
off some flvnamite which had r been
stored near at hand. \u25a0 .'
The shaft is 360 feet deen and it was
300 feet to the place where the men were
working. IhÂ£ men were supplied with
air fanned from the Â£haft and by
means of compressed air tubes. It is
the general opinion that the air pipe
was broken ] Â»' the explosion, but air
hau been steadily pumped in all day
with the remote hope that some of the
entombed men may have escaped the
furce of the explosion and the. after

The rescuers began work wltnin a
re iv minutes after the explosion. An.
attempt at fanning air in with canvas
was abandoned when the condition of
the shaft became apparent. Four
Phifts have since worked taking out
the debris and timber.
The condition of the timbers indicates
that it will be rifccessaO to recase the
mine, in which event tfae bodies may
not be reached before Wednesday or

"Innes is the best socialist in his
.line in America." So generously de
; clared Mayor Schmitz in his introduc
! Tory speech at the opening: of the May
\u25a0> Festival of Music at the Mechanics'
, .Pavilion last night.
[ \Tne Innes Band, with its three ac
,cornfsanylng soloists, gave last night
the â¢opening' concert of the f estivai.
The Ihuge hall, trimmed with srreens
&nd ifiags, looked its cheerfulest. and
with -a. festive odor of roast oeanut
snielt'i its best. A friendly crowd filled
abcut> a third of tha sezAa and heloed
an exceptionally abiebodied corps of
ushers , to make timely and untimely
noiae. * ,
. Mayor Schmitz in his speech &r>oke
eloquently of the admirable cause the
festival Is to benefit and of the duties
of San. Francisco in the matter. It
may possibly be one's duty this week
to listen to Mr. Innes and his fifty-five
men. But it is to be regretted that one's
duty lies that way. Mr. Innes' fifty
five men are all right. They are mostly
good ?nen and trne, if they are not
balanced as bandsmen were best to be
bale- need. It Is Mr. Innes that is the
\u25a0natter. One knows that it is no fun
hading a band through the curious
scouetlc Jungle at the Pavilion.
Creator* tried ft and came out only
Becond best. Rlvela had a try at it
\u25a0with a. new music-shell and achieved
or.ly fair result. Mr. Innes tried it
last night and with a slack beat cot
generally laid out.
One had a taste, however, of what
the InneÂ« band can do when Mr. Ron
covjeri took the baton for a moment
Roncovieri is neither a Sousa nor a
Creator*, but he picked up that band
last sight with a march composed by
himself to the tune of the only musical
playing that was done. Some clever
players there are in the band, and some
splendid .Instruments, and with the
spMted conducting of .Mr. Roncovlerl
in his bright little march things wak
ened up for a moment.
But Innes himself seems to me to
want in most of the essentials of good
conducting. Magnetism he has none,
his bÂ«at is uncertain, h!Â« readings
without authority, distinction or mu
eicianliness.
The, first number on the programme
This afternoon the children will.be
heard for the first time, and, despite
the. defections of the band, the acous
tic wonders of the Pavilion, and, any
other unfavorable circumstances,
there will be to hear something ; this
afternoon that one may not hear again
in a lifetime.
BLANCHE PARTINGTOX.
was the Weber overture, "Jubel," and
through the efforts of the aforemen
tioned ushers it elicited three encores,
granted by the conductor with the
aplomb of a Sousa. The Lassen "Fest"
overture. and two numbers by the con
ductor, one a lÂ«~>ely two-step, "Prince
Charming," were also on the list.
Everything was played in the same
fashion, and it is entirely fortunate
that the festival does not by any means
depend wholly upon its band numbers
for its success. When the children's
chorus with Us 2000 baby voices and
the adult chorus of 1000 voices are to
be heard, as they wllVbe every evening
this week (the children this and Satur
day afternoon*), the festival will offer
that which will be amply worth hear
ing.
The soloists with the band did
heroic work last night. In Franz N.
Huttman there is a tenor with a very
pleasing voice and method, though he
does not succeed in filling the big
place. He sang very well the Walther
"Prize Song" and fully deserved the
encore received. Mrs. Emma Part
ridge is the soprano and has plenty
of voice. "fairly well cultivated. She
grave a somewhat pretentlons render-
Ing of "Ocean, Thou Mighty Monster,"
and was encored. The other soloist
was Bohumlr Kryl, who plays the
cornet cleverly. He gave the "Car
nival of Venice."

the chairman of the executive ; com
mittee of the festival; S. SturÃres. who
said it was particularly appropriate
that Itr. Schmitz should >. officiate ;at
the inaugural of the event, not : ; only
because he was the chief executive,
but because. he was himself a musician.
Last October, when the enterprise
was entered into, Mr. Stursressaid.' it
was published to.' the people that the
intention was to give them ' such a
musical feast as is seldom' experienced
in San Francisco or any other, city.
All the planning and work were done
with that object in view, and now the
committee was _ prepared to "deliver
the goods." "You see," continued the
speaker, "that; the '^lnnes side is pre
pared to do its part. When to-morrow
afternoon you see the 3000 public school
children and in the afternoon the adult
chorus of 600 or. 700 voices on this plat
form, you will say they are ; prepared
to deliver the poods. It - remains fi for
the people of San Francisco to deliver
their part. We have entered into a con
tract with the people of the city of
which we 1 have fulfilled our* : end.*? and'
now the populace is called upon to ful
fill its part I believe it will'do'so."^
Mayor Schmitz came In for a*; large
piece of the applause * that 1 was 'being
generously given out. - Not., in thirty
years, he said, had a music fest of such
magnitude been planned ) in San Fran
cisco. Specialties of all kinds had: been
provided, he said," and tnose i who t. were
fortunate enough to pass the . doors
would be thrilled with what they heard.
San Francisco had had ; its seasons of
grand opera, had heard the best*sing
ers, instrumentalists ; and 5> conductors,
and it would rise to appreciation of the
magnificent entertainment -z that " had
been provided- for it by the promoters
of the May Festival. "Innes,"ihe said,
"is the best specialist in his line y, in
America. I . have . had â¢: the pleasure of
playing under him. I know him :. well
as a man and as a leader and in choos
ing him the authorities have \u25a0 chosen
well.

prisoners were discussedâ before, pris
on, in prison 1 and after prison^ Judge

OAKLAND, April SOiâ A steady in

indicating a 'quiet, healthy growth in
the \* population of .- the ", city. " This In
crease Nlnr the sales of I property' is not
In any\ sense . the" result , of a boom, for
there isnothing in the cityiat the' pres
ent--time| to : cause | such -a condition.
There J have ! been |no bonds voted, \u25a0 and
while there is considerable , speculation
In property along the proposed hew
lines of the Key Route "system,'", this has
had Â»but little effect' on real estate in
other parts of the city, and a large per
centage of the sales of residence prop
erty has | been made in sections where
the ; value of/ the ; land -for home sites
has been the only inducement to v the
purchaser, i ; â¢ ' . " ' 1 :

That the I in creased in \u25a0 th sale of I resi

desired for this step dancing. The

Owing to a misunderstanding as to the

JTersea on "Immortality'? Dedicated to
Two of His Friends.
NEW YORK, April 30.â The follsw
ing poem, entitied "Immortality." was
recently composed by Joseph Jefferson
and presented to his friends, Grover
Cleveland and E. C. Benedict:
Two caterpillars crawlliyj on a leaf, 0 ~.
By some strange accident In contact came;
Their conversation, passing all belief.
Was that name argument, the very same
That has been "proed and conned" from maa
c to man. 0
\u25a0Yea. ea-er since this woadroos world began.
The vr-y creatures â fiee>f etad dumb and blind,
r>evcld cf features that adorn mankind â
Were vain enough. In dull and wordy strife.
To speculate upon a future life.
The fim was optimistic. fuU of hope; Â°
The secoad, Quite dyepeptic, seemed to mope.

Fa.!d Number Ore: Tm rare of 'our salva

f-a'.S Number Two: 'Tm muz* of oar damna
tion; o c ! i
Oar ugly forma alone woold seal our fates
And bar our entrance throcch the golden gates.
Suppose that death should take us unawares.
Hew oculd be climb the ffMden stalrsT
If maldc&s shun us as they pass us by, â¢
. Would &ng?U bid us welcome In the Tsky?
I wonder what great crln-es we have commit
ted
That leave use' so forlorn and so u&pttled?
Perhaps we've been ungraterul, unforgiving;
'Tis p:aln to me that life's not worth the
living."
"Come, ecsne! Cheer up!" the jovial wuitu
replied :
"Let's take a look upon the other side.
euppose we cannot fly, like moths or millers,
Are wÂ« to blame for being caterpillars?
Will that st.ie God that doomed us crawl the

The ugly things composed themselves to die;
A cd so, to make their funeral quite complete,
Ka.cn wrapped him In his little winding sheet.
The tangled web encompassed them full soon,
7>.ch for his coffin made him a cocoon.
All through the winter's chilling blast they lay
I>ad to the world, aye, dead as human clay.

and Jjve;
Khe brlsgs sweet justice from the realms

She trlr.r* the chrysalis, she resurrects the

Two butterflies ascend encircling her head.
And so this emblem shall for ever be
A sign of Immortality.

ESCAPE FROM
BURNING AUTO
Manga Rera Ready to Sail.
The reÂ»urrected American ship Manga Reva,
which haÂ« rleen from thÂ« ruins of the British
ahlp Pyrenees, la now ready again to enter
the merchant marina servica. She will sail
for Honolulu on Tuesday In command of Cap
tain H. C. Townseiid. She will take a. cargo
of tutnr from that port for New York.
The hletory of the Manga Reva is of un
usual Interest. As thÂ« Pyrenees she sailed from
SeatUe Â©arty In 1000 with & cargo of wheat
for Enclaad. She took fire at sea when the
Dearest point was the Pltcalrn Islands and they
were 1600 miles away. Â« Under full Kill the
vessel was headed for the islands. =On ar
rlvaj tliera It was found Impossible to beach
the vessel. She was, then steered for Manga
Reva. where she was safely beached. \u25a0
All this time her canto was on fire. The
decks vert bulged up and so hot -that the
crew could barely walk on them. The crew
left her there tooher fate.
Captain E. A. Thayer later bought the vessel
from the underwriters for 51200 and brought
her to thl* port. When the ship arrived here
the was a sorry looking spectacle. Her masts
had been burned down, her desks were bulged
up and half of the deck was burned away.
Extensive repairs were necessary, but to
day the Manga fteva lies In the stream oft
Pacific tttr*et wharf as clean and trim a craft
as ever seen in the harbor.

BUZZARDS BAT. Mass.. April SO.â
Following cervices that were impres
sive in their simplicity and suggestive
of the c'^rtcur of the distinguished
actor the fcody of Joseph Jefferson was
to-day laid away at the Bay View.
Cemetery In Sandwich. Jefferson's five
sons, a score of t"^"â¢** frleads and
a hundred or more vUlagrem gathered
about the open grave while tho.oom-
Trlttnent aerrioe was recul. Then all
withdrew -with the exception of Chazles
B. Jefferson, who alone watched the
casket as It was lowered to its final
resting place. To-night a police of
ficer remained at the grave, and this
Sroard will be continued for several
day*.
At n o'clock this morning a brief
service was held at Crow's NÂ«at, the
Jerrersoa gammer cottage \u25a0 her*. Only
immediate relatives and Intimate
friends were present. The morning
train from Boston brought twenty-five
friends In addition to those already
here. Tie former included Dr. Richard
/Watsoa Glider, editor of the Century
) Magazine, and E. A. Taft'of Boston,
' president of the New Tork and Boston
Dispatch. Grovar Cleveland was un
eble to be here.
The casket had been placed In the
library and was banked on all sides by
c Cowers. There were pieces from the
Players* Club of New York and the
Bohemian Club of San Francisco, from
the' Old Colony Club of Sandwich, of
â¢which Jefferson was long the president,
and from well-known actors and
actresses in all parts of Uae country. â¢
The services opened with the reading
by Dr. Edward 'X. Horton of Boston,
chaplain of the State Senate, of Jef
ferson's favorite poem*, Tennyson's
â¢â¢Crossing the Bar." Dr. Horton then
referred to the simple life and
kindly deeds of the actor. A prayer
concluded the service and the casket
was immediately placed in a funeral
carriage -preparatory to Its removal to
Bay View Cemetery, at Sandwich, a
distance of eight miles. c
While the procession was on Its way
a public memorial meeting 'was held
In the Sandwich town hall, at which
eJI the clergymen of the town partici
pated. At the grave, which had been
prepared in the lot purchased by
Charles B. Jefferson at the suggestion
of his father two years ago, the flow
ers, "which had been brought from
Crow's Nest were arranged in a way to
Quite conceal the casket from view.
Here the services were brief. Dr. Hor
toa read the Unitarian burial service,
then withdrawing with the mourners
and frientfs. leaving Charles B. Jeffer
son alone for a time \u25a0with the dead.
Sewn sailors from the revenue cut
ter McCulloch had a struggle for life
In the choppy sea that was running
off Hurricane Gulch yesterday after
noon.' They were out for a pleasum
sail in one of . the ship's boats when
a sudden sauall- struck their craft
with great force and turned it upsldn
down. The occupants were, thrown
out right and left.
The sea was nasty and the " ourren t
running strong at the time. Th'!
sailors struck boldly; out for thei;:
overturned craft and finally.' managed
to reach lt^BSHj
Some clamored on top and thy
others hung to the sides. High waven
\u25a0were soon sweeping over them
Occasionally an unusually, high sea
would foroe a sailor to let go his hold
and ha would have a strenuous time
regaining It.
The accident was witnessed by peo
ple from the shore and on the differ
ent boats passing at the time. The
ferry-boat Cazadero had Just left
Sausalito on her 3:30 trip and her cap
tain saw the predicament of the sail
ors. ,Ha immediately ordered his ves
sel put about, and a boat was
launched and sent to the rescue of the
y*n,]f drowned men.
Captain. J. C Cantvrell, commander
of the McCulloch, was on the bridge
at the moment of the accident. He
at once ordered the ship's gig sent to
the men's assistance. Between the
two rescuing parties the men were
hauled out of the briny and carried
oa board the MoCulloch. The launch
Rob Roy put out from shore and made
fast to the overturned boat and towed
her alongside the revenue cutter.
The accident created great excite
ment among the passengers on the
Cazadero and the spectators who
â¢were watching -from the shore. Every
moment they expected to see one of
the sailors, who was washed away
from the upset boat, fail to come to
the surface again. It was a great re
lief to the excited crowd when the
drenched mariners were finally landed
on the McCulloch's deck.

LIFE'S SUNNY SIDE
PREVENTION of bribery in elections will be much easier of
attainment in New York if the law proposed by Senator,
Brackett and recently passed by the Senate be enacted.* Its,
intent is to prevent candidates and parties from profiting by bribery.
Under its terms local elections are invalidated if any corrupt prac
tices ;are proved; in case the wrong be done in a legislative elec
tion, the charges are forwarded by the local judge to the Spealcer
of the Assembly. The statute is to be distinct from the law which 1
directly punishes bribers. Its aim is to be more sweeping in its
efficacy than just to punish the tools of the corruptionists. 4 It will
make it so difficult for candidates to derive any benefits from
bribery done' without their knowledge and consent that they \ will
nbt be satisfied with being innocent of the knowledge of evil- that
may be going forward, but keenly on; guard against it as one of
the forces /working for their defeat.
Another good feature of the bill is that it puts into the hands
of every voter a ready and effective means to act on any election
corruption which may come to his" knowledge. By, depositing a
bond for which is a guarantee of his good faith, he .may peti
tion a j Justice of the Supreme Court or a County Judge alleging
upon -information and belief any corrupt practices in . his district.
The Judge is to act on this by summoning the chairman of. the
county committees of the. several political parties and the candi
dates to take part in the investigation of the charges. Pending the
investigation the canvassing board are to be restrairiedfrom. count
ing the returns.
: Bribery, beside? being such a prevalent and dangerous crime,
is so insidious that some very sweeping remedy is needed to cope
kvith jjt. This proposed [law would add* greatly to the force of the
\mt aimed : only against the bribe giver and the bribe . taker, s for?
Ihe purposed punishment of ; the candidate to be [ benefited would
lestroy/the. effectiveness of some of the most deep laid and secret
|o<i. This punishment, though indirectly given and : indirectly.
trried, would nevertheless often be richly deserved, because ths
ipfrant to office, although nominally dean handed, had not been
'jitchful of the evil done for him by others anl of" the corruption
party. The bill provides that if bribery has been prevalent
ia city or county the election shall be declared void and a new
bordered. \\ - {..:."..

HIS SAD FATE
ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
The handsome Byron was turned down by a disdainful heiress, you remem
ber.-Shelley survived a succession of refusals. Burke "was Jilted. by a^couple of
unappreciative Irish beauties. Jean'Baptiste Bernadotte, when private of ma
rines, was refused with Indignation by a girl of humble rank who said she was
"much too good to marry a common soldier." And Abraham Lincoln not only
did not receive a reply to his first proposal, written to the daughter of a poor
Irish settler who lived in a neighboring log cabin, but was also scorned by the
baught/damÃel, who tossed her head, and looked the other way the next time
they met.
As for the young married man whose wedded Joy Is tinctured by melan
choly because he f gels that he treated cruelly a sweetheart of early youth, I
should advise him to cheer up and to forget about it. The girl will presently,
if she does'not already, thank her. lucky stars for rescuing her from, a grjat
mistake^ and Â«o long as she lives she will, believe that he' Is still fondly
treaeuring her image in his heart of hearts.
: My observation has taught me that.
most men.have more than[two';sweet
hearts before (they finally "settle down"
tb'oatmeir every .morning for break
; ffcst, \ and â¢' dessert once a day. And '. It
; has also'fconvinced me that;lt* is the
[exceptional American girl who lets any
mere man ! break; her; heart.
'This will(uridoubtedly sound cynical
': tot those: who are 'enjoying ; the- grand
enthusiasm of a'first 'passion.- But it Is
not meant for "them; a~nd I give 'them
leave, to skipit. - Their elders whohave
va|nly:tried to lasso'orie or two chime
ras. wiHj^agree ;with me .that man's
heart \ Is quite -as changeable and fickle
as VlrgiT declares 1 the heart of woman
kind to be.' We are'only human! all of
us. Men ' and women; are ; chlpa of the
same; old .blockâ that : block from which
the history of the world is being fash
ioned."
">'As for man's remorseful conscience
.over the girl he. left- behind him I must
confess that' l consider this an evidence
of thÂ» humanizing- Influence of love
s upon' man's naturally ungrateful na
ture. For ordinarily, although we feel
very tender toward "one" who has re-,
ceived a benefit from "us. we are, likely
to feel a little hard toward one who
gives va a benefit for which we cannot
make an adequate return.
For every . : man who could 'have
married. his first love had he wished to
do so there are two who were rejected.
Some of 'the greatest men in history
wooed unsuccessfully in their first af- â¢
faires dii coeur.
A FRIEND has confided to metis belief that In every man s life there are
; twb r Â«weethearts, to both of whom he gives a serious affection, and tnac
- when he has married the second one. as he usually does, he Is nn * unt f a
m the midst of his happiness by a gentle regret at having disappointed tne
expectations of: the first. , .
I am not sure'whlch of two points in this statement struck me more forci
bly,-Its modest estimate of man's natural fickleness or its naive confession
of; masculine conceit. > \ .
There are at present more than the average number of conditions
affecting the great stock market .of the country. There are half a
dozen disturbances likely to depress prices. any day, such as the
uncertain outcome of the impending naval battle between the Rus
sians and Japanese, the Venezuelan and Moroccan affairs, the labor
outbreak at Chicago, the' high prices of stocks which imbue large
financial interests with caution, the Northwestern railroad fight, the
Equitable dispute, the Stock Exchange tax, etc. All these, of course,
influence values and tend to create a selling movement, which in'
turn imparts to trade 'a feeling of uncertainty. Hence stocks go
down, and those lines of trade which take their. hue from the course
of values in Wall street are unfavorably affected thereby. Usually
stocks take their cue from trade, but sometimes the conditions are
reversed, and this, seems to be one of these times. At any-rate, the
whole country has been watching street for a week or more:
But although the great May wheat deal at Chicago canie to
gTief/ resulting in a violent decline in that great Staple, and though
Wall street has' experienced an equally violent shrinkage in stock
valuations with enormous liquidations, the important staples of the
country are generally holding their own. The wool market has con
tinued. active and firm, in spite of very high prices for raw wool,,
which are making the sheep raiser rjchl The hide and leather trades
report active and strong markets everywhere, with aa active demand
for both export and local consumption. The textile and footwear
factories continue to run on full time, and are sending in most
cheerfui reports. c Provisions, too, are showing more tone and ac
tivity. Lumber seems to be in good condition, and the building
throughout the country is said to be unprecedented in our x history.
The cotton crop for 1904, as shown by the final bulletin of the Cen
sus Bureau, just issued, was the.largest ever known, being 13,584,000
bales. It exceeds the crop of 1903 by 3,491,000 bales, or 35.4 per
cent. The largest crop produced in the United States prior to 1904
was that of 1898, which, according to commercial returns, amounted
to 11,235,000 bales, or 15.9 per cent less than the crop of 1904.
The railroad earnings for April, as far as reported, are 10.7. per
cent larger than during the same month last yÂ£ar. The reports from
the iron and steel trades are conflicting, some important points^ re
porting; that production is running ahead of consumption, resulting
in lower quotations for some kinds of pigiron, while trie country is 4
still importing steel billets from abroad to satisfy ttie demand. This
is a paradoxical and confusing condition and imparts more or less
indecision to the industry.
Money continues abundant, and it is worthy of remark that
notwithstanding the great decline in Wall street stocks rates con
tinue low, showing easy conditions in funds. Mercantile collections
are easy and improving at most points, except in*the South, .where
they have lately become somewhat tardy. Eastern industrial cor
porations are expected to disburse $17,300,000 in dividends during
May, against $16,700,000 during ?May, 1904. These conditions are
significant indexes to the general prosperity of the country. /â¢
On this coast the signs are promising. The crops of 1905 are
looking well as a rule, and while some, such as several kinds of fruit,
have lately deteriorated, the majority are in, brilliant condition. Our
export business, especially with the Oriental countries, is large, and
our domestic trade never was more active. High prices'distinguish
most commodities, and the people apparently have no end of money
to spend, not only for the ordinary necessities of life, but in frivoli
ties. Luxury sighs voluptuously all around us. Money is in the
air. There is so much of it and so many agreeable ways of spending
Mt that embezzlements and defalcations are multiplying on all* sides.
So it appears that even prosperity as a beneficial condition has its
limitations and may grow to extremes^ like rank weeds in a rich
garden. Men steal more in prosperous than in hard times,
because, seeing so much pleasure and voluptuousness all around
them, the temptation is greater. But leaving moralizing, out of. the
question, this very ' carnival of theft in commercial , and political
circles shows the abnormally flush times prevailing throughout the
land. â \u25a0 j
r "TÂ»HERE was less irregularity in trade last week, and the reports
r from the different sections were rather more favorable than^ for
4 the preceding vyeek. The bank clearings did not run as high,
aggregating only $2,104,755,000, against over^jiso.otXJ.oco for tl'.e
preceding week, and the increase over last year also fell fronV6s.4 per
cent to 33 per cent, but all the important cities except \N T ew Orleans
were in the column of gains, and of the ninety-five reporting their
clearings only fourteen exhibited a loss. The highest increase was
84-2.per cent at" New York, but this was prdbably largely due to the
current excitement in the stock market.

aiao purchased and accepted by the L.ecis=lÂ«- I

Fort Rosa asd the Sonoma Mlssloa. by the
previsions c f t. G e leg^ielatlve act. will be in |
charge of the Board of Butters Fort Trustees, i
which board will provide for the preservation !
and protection of said property. The gutters
Fort Trustees are W. W. Greer, W. U. Devlin, i
GÂ«crce 'Vice tad William Laxnphrey.
The old Monterey Theater ajid the landing
place of Seb&stien VlscaJno (1002) and Juni- '
pero Serra, (1770J wiil fall to the care (of thÂ« j
ilonterey Custom-house Trustees, this board
consisting of FTask Madison. W. C Little. A. i
Meus, W. Jacks and Luther Rogers, a majority
of whom are Native Sons.
The members of Sonera* Parlor are particu-
Isrly interested in Sonoma Mission, expressing
Â» desire to meet within its historic walls and
to act ac caretakers without expense to the j
Slate. TbÂ« Monterey Custom-house Trustees j
have granted this privilege to the Native Son
and Native Daughter parlor* of Monterey, and
icrtainly no more zealous caretakers could be
peiÂ»<*ted.
Thus it is seen that the State is now
in full possession of the following his- j
toric places, some of which are famous. ]
and whose fame will grow as a knowl
edge of their romantic and dramatic
history grows familiar â as it must,
with the awakening to State patriot
ism" that is now rife:
Landing place of Viscaino and Serra.
Monterey, 1602 and 1770.
Mission of Sonoma (Mission San
Francisco de Solano), built in 1823.
Fort Ross, Sonoma County, built by
the Russians about 1800.
Custom-house at Monterey, built
during the Mexican regime.
Colton Hall at Monterey, renowned
as the meeting place of the first con
stitutional convention in California.
And all these are now under the j
jurisdiction of commissioners appoint- !
ed by the Governor, to whom the State
must look for their future care and
restoration.
Already the commissioners can be
heard proclaiming a dearth of funds
for the unusual tax thus levied uoon
them. But who knows but some erood
Samaritan may crop upâRockefeller
like â and lend a. hand. And lam con-,
vinced that Califomlans would evince
the good taste to accept ltâ and let the
good it doeth wash away its taint, if
taint there be.

The Forum Club had a beautiful
time on Saturday afternoon, - the
occasion of the annual luncheon:
The deft fingers of Mrs. John Gil
more made of the club rooms a great
pink bower, palms and ferns lending
their beauty. .
These Forum women have never
been accused ofÂ° dull affairs â but'Sat
viirday's was notably gay.
* Even the toasts were gay and gayly
rendered as follows:
Presentation by Mrs. Prank Fred
ericks, the re-elected president, of the
toast mistress, Mrs. Frederick Kellogg.
The first toast, "Fads," was desponded
to by Mrs. C. H. Wood. Mrs. A. L.

! Have you heard of the Sacajawea
\u25a0 Statue Association ?
Sacajawea, commonly known as
j the Bird Woman, was, as everybody
j knows, the Indian who guided' the
i Lewis and Clark expedition through
! the northern wilderness to the ocean,
I making the hazardous trip with her
i papoose strapped , to her back and
against the expressed will of her peo
| pie. So heroic was _ her. conduct that
j the records of the c expedition speak
! feelingly of the public service she-ren
j dered to the emissaries of the Govern
ment.
Now it is proposed to erect a statue
of Sacajawea â It is ;already cast at a
I cost of $7000 â in Portland during the
exposition, and a call is made to all
who are interested to join the league
that the necessary funds be raised.
; The payment of 550 to Mrs. Sarah A.
Evans, Oswego, Oregon, will obtain a
membership in the league.
Miss Katherine Chandler, the clever
student of Western history. Is a vice
; president of the organization. And, by
j the way, she has a book in press on the
("Bird Woman," which snould make
very interesting reading. .

SUMMARY.
Uncle's baseball warriors seem to
hax-e struck iheir gait at last.- as twice
yesterday they cmade the Commuters
look like bush leaguers. The going was
. easr, as not a Seal had to turn & hair
during the process of handing It out to
Oakland. Miller and Cbrbett were the
men behind in both instances. Both
had slants to waste, and bath walloped
the ball a few. Scores: Morning game
âSan Francisco -A, Oakland 0. After
noon game â San Francisco "3, c Oak
land L Â°
This double \ictory puts Uncle next
to th# Tacoma Tigers in the chase after
The rag. The series of two weeks broke
\u25a0with seven games for San Francisccf,
six for; Oakland and a tie battle. From
the niaaner in w^ich the Seals played
ball at the bediming Of the series It
seemed they wauld stop with about
two games, but they finished strongly
and therebyegot a way c with the series.'
The afternoon game was spoiled by
tnt- worst act ever performed
on a ball field In this city. Marty Mur
phy showed what a "rowdy he iscwhen
he assaulted Umpire Ball Perine in the
<*ecoudi inning without cause. He did
cr.fft stop" at one blow, but rained punch
aft?r punch en the face of the indicator
man till the players pulled him away.
Perine called two strikes Sm Murphy
and. the latter was then retired on an
infield play. He walked up to the um
pire and a Text words passed between
c tbem. Murphy suddenly hit Perine In
the face. He staggered c the frail indi
cator^man and then came back. Blow
after o blow did the rowdy shower 6n
the jaw of Perine. Parke Wilson held
him for a minute, but he broke away
and came back once more.
o'Tn> crowd hissed and Jeered and
hcoted. Such an exhibition had never
been witnessed by the fans before and
they all vented their Ire on the 0 man
who would "unite hoodlumism and
ball playing. Murphy was arrested on
complaint of President Bert and hur
ried to the City Hall Police Station.
The president also expelled him from
the league.
When Perine returned to the garae
he was cheered lustily by the b-^
crowd of fans." When Murphy left the
grounds in the middle of the game, fol
lowed end preceded by an officer, the
crowd hooted. Walter Christie, the
Berkeley trainer, helped Perine out
during the remainder of the game by
taking care of the plays on the bases.
Joe Corbeltonot only put the Com
muters away with a pair of hits, but
he brought two runs across the plate
with a resounding two-cushioner to left
field in the fourth epasm. Then again
he opened up the third .with a single
and went all the way to < the last base'
on TV*a!dron's sacrifice. <.It was a pretty
play and Joe worked It when he saw
Bo one was taking care of the sack. A
bad throw by Byrnes let Joe
the first one for Uncle.
Ft was- Corbett's wild pitch that al-
Insved the Commuters to get a run and
saved them the., disgrace . of a white
wash. With Francks and Byrnes on the
paths, and one gone In thecfifth, Joe
th^tt ; the ball past Shea and allowed
the run to come u 'through. The next
.tv-o irsÂ£h dlea eaÃily, So If would have
t>*>enca clear case of shut-out had Joe
rt-taihed his control.
The Seals left last night for Tacoma
en their first this season. Nealori
wjli.be in the game right along, though
Mohler cannot play till the Seals re
turn again. Walters Is also liable to be
out for. some time. Oakland meets Los
Anseles here this week. As the Angels
win rot arrfvec In time from Seattle
th^re will be no game at Oakland on

There Is a growing belief in the
mijvds of the police that Pietro Tor
turlci, the murderer of Biaggio Vilardo,
has committed suicide. Policeman
Frank Esola, who knows Torturicl and
has been working steadily on the case,
admitted yesterday that Torturlci had
declared as soon as he learned that
the police were searching for him that
he would never* be taken alive. He
made the declaration to a woman, who
informed- Esola.. : She also said that
Torturici had shown her a revolver.
Whether he is ? dead or alive the
search for. him is being vigorously
prosecuted by Policemen- Esola, Evatt
and Freel throughout thÂ« Latin quar
ter. They are hampered by the \u25a0 re
ticence of those who could help; them
but for fear of the vengeance of the
Mafia. .
" The case of Mrs. Rosa Torturicl will
be laid before the Grand Jury to-day
and to-morrow afternoon the argu
ment on her application for release on
a writ of habeas corpus will be heard
by Judge Lawlor.

on the night of April- 21 when Thomas

at the City â¢ Prison -to-day - to . see if
they can identify .Â£ him. ,W.
H. Riddel had a look at \u25a0 In 'the
prison, but he could not recognize} him
'as one of the three men t he said .he
saw standing at'- the ; , entrance : to the
just before the pop of revofver^s.
Riddel was arrested as a susbect , by,
Special Polieceman Staub. :.,:'.-.
Detective -Ryan Is looking for James*
Brown, ' ek-ebnvict; and companion'bf
â¢Kelly.' Brown- lived at 1 ;. Gilbert street".'
Be has,' not been there since. the night
of the* murder, 'as the" place has bee'n ,'j
watched. Circumstances point strong
ly to Brown as the man who fired the
shots at J3rutt and possibly
Reilly. Shortly after the shootimr he ;
Ava's s.een crdssing Fourth and .Bryant |
street's in" the 3 direction'; of his | h6me. \u25a0":;
He was hsttless. A policeman came "in i
sight and Brown dodged behind a tele- ;
graph pol^.- "This." fact, "observed .by a
'pedestrian, has aroused* suspicion^ ,
0 Brown "served a term in >'. the Deni
, tehtlary at 'Walla Walla and â¢ was dis
charged . four or -five- months 9 aero. It
has been discovered* that ,_ the *hat left
.behind' had "been purchased in Port
land about that time, and , Brown : was
evidently the purchaser. * Detective
Ryan says Brown, Kelly ] and another
ex-convict named Burke went
and were suspected of ' committing . all \u25a0
of the recent saloon hold-ups. 1'
Riddel, 'Skurs and Hunter, the three
suspects, are still being "held- In.the
prison pending developments. Yester
day Detective ; Ryan booked William
Beebe on two" misdemeanor^ charees.
Beebe lived in "the"; same "house with

An immediate result of tlie investiga

; i It. Is Btartllnsr. and unheard f of." One man in
a political office had $2,000,000 of thoÂ»peoplo'B
money > under \u25a0 his ; direct control. . ' The, wonder
is that the ; defaulting ; Tax .' Collector : did : not
taJte more. Under the system that still exists
.he could have made ' away, with - the \u25a0' entire
I $2,000, 000. : : The existing state \u25a0\u25a0 of , affairs In the

The- laxity In the matter of bonds for
clerks ; Avho \u25a0-\ are v handling 5 the : city's

pointed rout jby Expert \Douglas Young.
It.isbrought to the notice of the Grand

for $10,000. r.While: lt is certain that the

pointed by Mayor Schmitz to 'succeed

/Smith's stealings and crooked'manip
ulations of Uhe ' city's % money; were so
complicated;that ! the \u25a0 matter of itracing
them -is exceedingly; difficult. j
There r are " heads s. to fall in the ' Tax
Cqllector's office," the office

of Foreman Andrews there ; are several
