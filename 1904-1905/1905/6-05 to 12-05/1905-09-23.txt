COMMON HONESTY
WILL BE KEYNOTE
OF THE CAMPAIGN
Redemption of San Erancisco
Cause to Which Gandidate
Is Dedicated.
His Address Inspires Legions
of Good Citizenship to
Another notable triumph of the San
Francisco Republican League â. was
achieved at Alhambra Theater, last even
ing, when John S. -Partridge was ac
claimed the Republican nominee for
Mayor. . Moreover, the platform of j the
convention declares against corruption In
the management of municipal affairs, and
every delegate In the nominating- body , is
not only pledged to abide .by the princi
ples expressed in the platform, but is fur^
tbfJVJiJedged^ to support the_nomineeB of
"~*Â£be convenTion.** The 'thlFd^ victory ~vt â¢ the
League forcea is gratifying in the highest
degree to -all citizens who have enlisted
In the campaign for a' clean administra
tion. The Initial success at the primary
election on August S was followed by 'vic
tory gained in the organization of the
convention in the face of unfair and un
principled opposition.
The third triumph gained last night
gives the League the controlling hand in
affairs of the Republican party.
The gallery last night was packed to its
utmost seating capacity. Grafters of the
Ruef-Schmitz administration were turbu
lent and noisy at intervals, but the spirit
of resistance to the will of the N people,
which was so Insolently displayed last
Tuesday night by the blatant apostles of
graft, was very much subdued.
The Ruefters were not only defeated,
but outgeneraled. Ruefs lieutenants,
Kase and Countrymen, were slow of per
ception on the field of conflict. Control
of the County Committee was won by the
League in a Hash, while the: Ruefters
were dazed and bewildered.
On the street after the adjournment of
the convention many of the old timers
commented on Ruefs lack of skill and
judgment in the handling of the minority.
The boss occupied his usual place in the
Forty-fifth District delegation and con
sulted at intervals with the voluble George
Boyne, secretary of the Police Commis
sion.
It was noted last night that the dele
gate* on the main floor and the gallery
throngs were fairly good natured. and
wÂ«ire quick to grasp the humorous inci
dents of the session. When Thomas K.
Kase. a resident of Alameda and a Ruef
delegate from the Forty-fourth District
of San Francisco, made reference to "po
lice and lire protection" afforded by the
Schmitz administration there was a sud
dtn outburst of merriment. The inter
minable minority report read by Kase ex
hausted the patience of delegates and
epe^tators. More than once the Teader
\u25a0was admonished -of the danger of losing
the. last boat to Alameda. The police ar
rangements for preserving .order were
creditable, and the' fact was noted that
the officers of the law behaved In a com
mendable manner.
The report of the conference committee
on fusion was agreed upon yesterday, but
was not presented last night. The Call
ascertains that the report provides that
the Democrats shall have the naming of
twelve Supervisors, two Police Judges,
the Sheriff, Pubnc Administrator' Re
corder. District Attorney and : Coroner.;
The Republicans name the Mayor, six
Supervisors, Treasurer, Auditor, City 'At-'
"torney. County Clerk and Tax Collector..
The report of the conference committee
on fusion will be presented to the 'major-'.
lty caucus of Republican delegates before
action is taken in the convention. Early
next 'week the convention will hold an
other session.
One of the events of the session last
night was the speech of Chairman Daniel'
A- Ryan, placing John S. Partridge In
nomination for Mayor. At the outset the
Ituefters uttered "boo boo" noises,
throwing in an occasional cheer" for
Schmitz, but the speaker waa not dlscon-'
certed. Delegate Kase. noting that the
Interruptions were \u25a0.' doing no _ good . for
Schmitz or'Ruef,.made an appeal- to the
gallery that Ryan be -permitted to speak.:
The Ruefters aloft > instantly obeyed or
ders, and Ryan finished bis remarks with
out , further interruption. ': *t'S !

Partridge in accepting the nomination
spoke as follows: '
"Mr. Chairman, Gentlemen of the

"Gentlemen;- why should any one

"Honesty, of purpose shines . brighter

of the new politics ; ih America.

HELSINGFORS, Finland. Sept .22.â
War against the authority "of the Czar In
an effort,' to - secure the . Independence of
Finland la ' believed , to be Imminent. ;It 13
asserted ; that 300,000 Finnish Turners, of
ficered byj Swedes, are ready for tacte t first
call to arms.
Supposed â¢ charity societies are said to
have : collected a war fund of . 100,000,000
rubles ($31.000,000). . Eleven cargoes of am
munition have been landed " and distribu
ted. Guns for. the . revolutionists .have
been . supplied . and carefully concealed.
Nine hundred representatives of. the Fin
nish, people were to have met: In Helsing
fors within the last, few days to proclaim
the. independence, of Finland, but a ship
wreck : which : occurred a fortnight ago
disarranged the plans of the leaders and
prevented the meeting.
â¢ A prominent . Finnish : Senator . said to
day: "That shipwreck has only delayed
our independence. The treaty of ISO 9.
which ; united Finland to Russia, did not
give;; the _ latter suzerainty overT the
former,- the two being in a union similar
to that then existing between Sweden and
Norway. \u25a0 . '

lest I should be tempted to promise more
than I could perform, but I feel that I
can pledge myself to all these things, and
that is the only pledge I have taken, or
shall ever take.
"Gentlemen, it Is worth while some
times to etop and consider what a splen
did city this is. Queen of what an em
pire! How beautiful, how stately, how
magnificent! With what wonderful ca
pacity /cr future growth. Tributary to
htre are the great forests of the north;
foreier. with bounteous prodigality, the
earth yields her its choicest, fruits, and
the. sea. its dearest treasures; the ships
of the world pile high her docks with the
wares of the Orient and the southern
ceas.
CITY'S XAME MUST BE CLEA>\
"Westward the star of empire takes its
way, and now fixed and blazfng and
beautiful it seems to have stopped ab\ve
this favored shore. Crown of pine for
your northern hills, crown of olive for
your southern elopes, crown of gold for
ycur city by the sea. what do they all
avail if her good name is gone, if. she is
shamed in the eyes of the watching
world, the scarlet letter on her bosom?
What boots her wealth, when the ringer
of Bcorn is pointed at her? All her beau
ty, her prosperity and pride, and her
.boundless hopes of the future are stained
with the stain of corruption, slimy with
graft, foul with, iniquity. Shall 1 this blot
remain upon her fair fame?; It jshali not,
znuet not, can cot be!
"If the enemy think they are going
to mark our the lines of this battle
for me they will be mightily mistaken.
Long ago I got into the habit of mak
ing the other fellow take my kind of
a fight. They shall not make a class
fight of It. I don't recognize any
classes, except the grafter and the
honest man. I want the boodlers to
vote against me. I couldn't sleep o'
nights if I thought any of them were
for me.
"Throughout this campaign and aft
erward, if I am elected, I am going
to hammer them as. hard as I know
how. And if Itm not successful they'll
at least know they've been In a fight.
Why, they can't live, except in the
dark, and I'm going to try. and. let the
sunlight in on them. If we win â and
with the help of honest men. Repub
licans and Democrats, we can't lose â
the poorest citizen shall get the same
square deal as the richest corporation
â just what In law and justice he's en
titled to, and not one iota more. ..
GRAFTBKS A PCJfY CROWD.
"Ten; years- in politics and two years
-In Che City "Attorney's""' office '" have
taught me to recognize-. a grafter' as
tar as I can see him. -^Tlrey're a puny
crowd. Show 'em up, take away j their
â¢power to fool the people, and they -are
\u25a0 the most pitifully impotent set â¢of
scalawags on earth.
- "They wear the bold masks of fight
ing men; tear off the masks and you
-flnd a set of mealy faced cowards with
livers white as milk. So let us stop
not, loiter not. look not backward.
The temper of the reformation we de
sire is to be made good by big telling
blows. Stop striking: and you will do
nothing-. Strike feebly and you will
do almost as little. The great now,
Â«o quick, so broad, so fleeting, is be
fore you; in an hour it will belong to
the eternity of the past. We are
thrice armed because we have our
<iuarrel Just, and with the mighty army
of those who want the right back of
us, with the good citizens of this com
munity aroused, outcome of this strug
gle is assured and you will see the
forces of corruption broken and scat
tered before you.
â¢ "My friends. I am ready for this
fight. False witnesses will rise up and
,lay to my charge things that I knew
not. but I believe the people, of this
city will be satisfied that I ani grimly
earnest In this thing and that I have
meant every word I have said to-night.
And now, with a humble soul, with
nothing In my heart but simple truth,
with a Srm resolve to act only for the
â¢\u25a0welfare of this city, with 'no hope to
rise Or fear to fall.' with trust in God
Md with no passion but for the des
tiny of San Francisco, I leave my can
didacy In your hands.'!
Great Throng
Watches the
Proceedings
The crowds began to- gather. at the
convention hall at an early hour. The
memory of the riot and strife of the
last session was fresh In. the minds of
those that were there and the story had
been beard by. other thousands, who
had resolved not* to miss such a scene
again. As a result the galleries were
packed an hour before the convention
.was called to order. More police than
were in evidence at the last session
were on duty and in place: of one ser
geant, a captain and three- sergeants
directed the corps of patrolmen. This
activity on the part of ' the police fol-
Jowed the expose of their reprehensible
actions at the last session ; in aiding
the Ruef ruffians in , their efforts to
'stampede the convention. And a corps
of Deputy Sheriffs was on hand, Sheriff
Curtis taking: care ..to., weed out the
deputies with - pro-Schmitz ' sympathies.'
Ttae - deputies constituted a . formidable
force, ln themÃelves and it was with a
.feeling of safety that the convention
resumed Its labors. 1
The cqnventlon- was called to order
shortly after 8 .'o'clock; by,. Chairman
Daniel A. Ryan. Ryan's appearance
was "greeted, with cheers ' by t the. league
wing, silence ; from . the', Ruef end ' and
mingled cheers and. jeers 1 from. the gal
lery.? Clanging his gavel^on', a sheet of

circulated during the day that the com
mittee would throw out the : Ruef delega
tion from the" Twenty-eighth. Should such
action be taken, "the report werit^ it was
to be taken as v signal for a riot among
the!Ruefltes,*,to be followed by "a' bo.lt* of
the defeated faction from the convention
hall and the nomination by it of an inde
pendent ticket. But the foresight of the
league leaders robbed Ruef "of his oppor
tunity. The report recommended that ;the
Ruef delegation be permitted to remain
In the convention and that the entire* list
of ' delegates as certified by the Registrar
be accepted as the roll' of the convention.
The' silence that fell over the beaten fac
tion evidenced the fact that it : had been
outgeneraled, a few scattered' cheers from

GAS HATE TOO HIGH.
We pledge our nominees for au^trvisora to
& redaction of the exorbitant gas rates now
exacted from the consumers of baa Francisco
thrvueli the action oi the Democratic majuntj
of the present Hoard of Superviaurs, witn the
concurring vote ot the Republican Supervisors,
la fixing the annual gas rate o: the city at
$1 per thousand cubic feet, when the com
paries ramtiyfng sucn gas were actually charg
ing at me time only 75 cents per mousand
cubic feet and the ligures submitted to the
Board of Supervisors conclusively showed that
it could be delivered at a lair pront for even
lesa than the last naaied rate, proof of which
is further furnished by the statement of in
creastd protits now presented by the gaÂ« com
pacy asd by the eoormously increased value
of Its etock since the action of the Hoard of
Â£upervu-oTB in unfairly raising its rates for
ga* euKilled. >
We applaud the action of the Republican
members of the Board of Supervisors in re
maining faithful to their trust and in voting
for a reduced **\u25a0* rate with the exception of I
Rcpubiic&a Supervisor Fred Eggers. whom wÂ»
denounce for betraying his trust to the people
and to fci* party by voting with the l>emocratÂ»
of the board tor the dollar ratÂ«.
We denounce the protracted, long-delayed
aad loag-drawn-out conduct of the suit of the
Spring Valley Water Works against the cit?
as a eubterfuge enabling that company to colÂ«
lect now for over three years its old rates,
which are much higher than those allowed by
the new ordinances, and we call upon the
Republican City Attorney and his assistants
to hasten the trial of this cause so that tha
present rate-payers may. before they all die.
obtain some relief trom their over-taxation.
POLITICIAN UNDER SUSPICION.
WÂ« look with suspicion upon the manipula
tions of a notorious Spring Valley Water Com
pany politician and Mf close and intimate
connection with the governing body of one of
the Republican faction* Â«>f this city, and with
its proposed fcomineeE for high otfice, as Inim
ical to the best interest of the water-rate pay
ers of San Francisco, and In the Interest of
the Spring /Valley Water Company.
We favcr the acquisition and public owner
ship of ail municipal, gas, electric light," tele
phone and telegraph and street railway sys
tems.
We favor the Immediate construction of the
new City and County Hospital. â¢ The sick
wards of the city should be housed in better
quarters and eui rounded by better conditions
than txist in the present ramshackle struct
ures. We demand that .the moneys authorized
in the recÂ«?r.t bond issue to be expended for
this purpose be at once .levoted thereto. C
The city has cold, over ?4.0O0,CÂ«0O worth-*Â»of
Londs recently authori7Â«sl. Including $250,000
secured --""Troiii : the sale of bonds for this pur
pope, almost. all of which lies Idle and unused
in the city treasury, and upon which the tax
payers of this city are now paying some
5iÂ»;3.'KHÂ» per ahnum Interest.
The delay and the refusal or the dominant
n>*Joritr <rf the Board of Supervisors, because
or their political differences with the Mayor,
and their desire to Injure him in the eyes of
the people cf this city, is costing the citizens
of ?Â£n Francisco not only over 5161.000 per
yrar tn interest on unused bond moneys {over
J13.000 per month), but Is even nacre costly In
the failure to supply th* much-needed utilities
and improvements for which the bonds were
authorized.
BETTER STREETS DESIRED.
, We pledge our nominees for Supervisors to
allow sufficient raonry consistent with econom
ical and honest admliJ*tratlon for street re
pairs, etreet Improvements and street, sweep
ing.
In order that every section of the city may
hayÂ« proper and needed attention, under the
supervision cf an official familiar ivlth its
wants, we pledge ourselves to nominate eight
een one from each Assembly Dls
tict in the city.
We favor the expenditure ef more of ; the
money raised by taxation for permanent jiub
lic improvements, and for the repair and im
provement of cur streets.
We pledge them also to liberal and fair
treatment of our public schools, and favor the
immediate erection of new school buildings and
better accommodations for the children of our
cltr.
We commend and Indorse the present system
of appointment of teachers to the School De
partment of this city by competitive examina
tion among the holders of certificates, and the
appointment of those who successfully pats the
examinations in orde^i of- their standing in
each examination, and commend Mayor
Echrs'.tz and the Board of -Education appointed
\u25a0fey him for removing the appointment of teach
*-rs absolutely from the. sphere of political In
fluence, partisanship and favoritism.
' We believe the best - Interests of education
require that the School Department be entirely
divorced from politics, and that advancement
depend upon merit alone to the \u25a0 exclusion of
political and personal favoritism, and we
pledge our nominees to carry out these prin
ciples.
Furtbermor**. we recommend that all Asi
atics, - both Chinese \u25a0 and Japanese, should be
educated separately from the other children in
schools.
We demand that all etsppliea for the public

We demand that the street-sweeping appar
atus of this city be owned and operated by
the municipality. .
We i recognize that a ' necessity exists for a I
fÂ«nd to carry on permanent improvements,
t>uch 'as repairing and repaying streets," re

We therefore pledge our candidate for Mayor
and our nominees for the Board of Supervisors
to reserve a fund when making up the annual
budget of at least 10 cents on the dollar raised
by taxation, the came to be used for permanent
I Improvements -and to be designated as the
\u25a0 "municipal permanent Improvement fund."
| We further pledge our nominees for Mayor
and Supervisors to dismiss all unnecessary em
ploye* so that a saving of at least $100,000
per annum can be effected and the money thus
saved devoted to permanent Improvements.

The police and fire departments shall be ad

tion to all.
OPPOSED TO< POLL. TAX. S
j Believing that the poll - tax system now in
j existence unjustly discriminates against the
I poor- man. Inasmuch as hÂ«s pays a larger per
' centage in proportion to his S means and I ln
{ come than his wealthy neighbor, we favor the
1 abolition of this uneo.ua! tax..
* We favor absolute home rule for the city
and county of San Francisco, and pledge our
nominees "and our party to work to that end.
ThÂ» interference by ,the Legislature with
the internal affairs of San Francisco, notwith
standing the charter, is coating our city much
money and is encroaching upon her . rights of
Belt-.overnment. â¢.
We favor a constitutional amendment which
ehall make It impossible for State boards of
equalization arbitrarily to raise the assess
ment of this city, already overassessed, es
pecially as regards Its smaller property hold
ers. .. \ K -
We also favor such changes In the laws
w.wlll place the water front of San Francisco
under the control of the municipal government,
co that the administration of the water front
may be conducted more with- a view to the
commercial advancement and prosperity of the
city than as an asylum for the political ref
ugees of the State who are strangers to San
Francisco, not Interested in Its welfare and
Ignorant of Us needa.
Every candidate nominated by this conven
tion shall appear before It and Indorse this
platform.
As soon as Kase concluded the read
ing of his pro-Schmitz document Dele
gate R. H. Countryman asked that the
document be taken up seriatim. Chair
man Ryan, however, called ror the vote
on the question as to whether it should
be adopted as an amendment to the
committee platform, holding Country
man's motion out of order. Before the
astonished j Ruelites could catch the
situation, so used had they become to
voting "No," a majority of them Joined
the leaguers in the shout of "No," and
Kase's effort was buried beneath a roar
of negatives. The vote on the commit
tee platform was then called for and it
was adopted, the Ruef wing rolling, out
a long but futile "No-o-o-o."
When Kase was reading his Schmitz
eulogy some interruption in , ' the gal
lery called Delegate Nathan C. Coglan
to his feet.- Coglan called upon all to
give Kase a fair and full hearing. His
injunction" was obeyed, the gallery ber
ing willing to ren&in silent, it request
ed, while one of its own men was on
the platform.
The question of the platform being dis
posed of, Ralph L. Hathorn of the Thir
ty-fifth moved that the regular business
of the convention proceed, nominations
for Mayor, being first in; order. The
motion was greeted with cheers for Part
ridge, and when Chairman Ryan ' sur
rendered the gavel to Vice Chairman
W. H. Davis that he might place the
league caucus | candidate in nomination,
the league wing of- the convention rose
en masse and with waving handkerchiefs
drowned with cheers "the howls of the
defeated faction. .
PLEA IS MADE FOR SILEXCB.
The first words from Ryan's lips were
greeted with insulting shouts and hisses
from the Ruefites and it was here that
the first spark of decency or fair play
among his followers made itself manifest.
Securing recognition from the chair, Kase
arose and said:
When I was on the floor the privilege of
epeaklng comparatively without interruption
was accorded me, and I now ask the delegates
and you who fill the galleries to accord -Mr. <
Ryan the came courtesy.'
We are all Republicans here aa yet, . and I
ask that In the name of Republicans, . of free
speech, of Justice and fairness that you hear
Mr. Ryan until he finishes. ,
If any one had a doubt before that Ruef
had packed the gallery with' his follow
ers, the silence mat followed Kase's ad
dress corrected that impression. Like
trained animals, the mob that a minute
before had jeered' tind; hissed Chairman
Ryan became silent; subdued and ' cowed
under the wave of their master's _ hand.'
Chairman Ryan then proceeded prac
tically without Interruption. / 4Vhen- he
reacaed Partridge's name /the, "league
wing again rose in a body and cheered
the man it . has selected ; to ' lead in the
fight for civic honesty. .
Ryan spoke as follows: --- - s
The most. lmportant concern of the people of
San Francisco at the present time. is the selec
tion of a new municipal chief executive, and
so Important is it that the people of. the two
great old parties, the -parties of Jefferson and
Lincoln, are willing to lay aside' party, lines,
forget old disputes and contests I and join to
gether to fight the : enemy . of all mankind â
dishonesty. There are. no party lines for the'
American people when the whole or any part
of the State or nation is In danger. There are
no carty lines when the banners are ' unfurled
and the drums beat for the battle against 'the
enemies of our country/. So there. are no party
lines when tne -people - rise 'x to . battle' against
the greatest foe of all natlons^corruption in

will do them and the State the most good who

Ensign Wade lies in the Naval' Hospital
at. Mare Island suffering from the effects
of a severe operation , . for appendicitis.
His testimony is considered very material
to the case', because he was in charge of
the engine room of -the Bennington aftlie
time of \u25a0'. the : explosion. His physician.
Passed Surgeon -Charles G. i Smith, states
that the condition of the .yoiing officer is
so serious that a month', will probably
pass before he will be able to give . bis
testimony. ~: > .-\u25a0 /\u25a0
The decision to - postpone j the case- was
reached only after, the bitterest and long
est fight that has taken place since the
beginning of the trial., The prosecution de
manded that the defense proceed and that
, the .testimony of Ensign .Wade be | taken
later, basing the argument. on a promise
made. by Judge Gear that] he would ac
cept such a -proceeding.;.- i< -
: The attorney for the defense admitted
the promise, but tainted : that conditiona
had so changed that to proceed would be
dangerous to the cause of . Commander
Young.
â¢ "If we\ are . forced to proceed .without
the testimony, of. Ensign Wado it will be
more than prosecution, it will be perse
cution,"."he arguedj with' heat.
The court, decided that It would be un
fair to the defense to, have. the case pror
ceed without the testimony.^ of Ensign
Wade and granted the continuance.
Neither side is satisfied. Commander
Young would far rather have- gone' on
without the testimony of. Ensign Wade,
although' he seemed willing to have it en
tered as evidence Captain We6t desires
to proceed, but' Insists on the story "> of

and I may add, of the whole university,
for John D. 'Spreckels'. munificent gift
to the German department of the beau
tiful library, and I want to tell you
something about the library, its value,
and about the man'who collected it- and j
about how he got It. :
','Some years ago., we were pretty hard
up for books; especially along certain
lines in Germanics,' and though'the.re
gents were very liberal-'in their library
appropriation and we had a -good deal
of money to spend every year and we
knew that ultimately we would have a
library, we "wanted it . then, t A "future
library was not very, satisfactory to us,
and wherever we turned in our work]
we found. ourselves "short'of .the'stand- .
ard works". | So" I 1I 1 thought' I "would -have,
to go out and tr>''to- raise a. fund, the |
Interest of which was'.toibe devoted to ',
the -increas6-4>f the -appropria^ [
tion^ â¢ forrnhe' â¢ purch4se"'of ' books unj
German, and I made a puoilc- appeal in J
the papers and \a" committee was ap
pointed'which was very sanguine .about
the result of this appeal; but if it was
j expected that men would hasten to get
[ rid of their surplus cash by sending in
1 checks for the German- library âthey J
I were, .disappointed. .There . was not -a f
single check came iii In- response" to^
that appeal, and I raa,de,up my mind
that that meUiod wTaiild not' work; it \
was easier to. get one large donation t
fronv.one man than "an equal amount j
in many small subscriptions from a j
number of them. :; ' ;.. ?''\u25a0*. 1 ; S.Vi,i

lin, on the whole perhaps the roost dis
tinguished of the German philologists

eltlon of the .klnd'ln Germany/ the chair
of Germanic philology at Berlin. I had
seen his library and looked over It, hah-f
died a number of the. books in his room
some years before his death, and, l knew
that It would be a great prize for any
one, that could secure It. But there wan
one' objection to It; there is always to
the purchaSe i of a whole library: ; that
-it contains, of [ course, ; a" great many
duplicates, duplicating " a -considerable
number of books already on- hand,
ever. It' Is on" the other hand one great
advantage, such a library. It affords fa
class of books which - you g cannot or
dinarily acquire by purchase.
WHAT UNIVERSITIES NEED.
"A university library, needs both^thej
newest books and the oldest. The new>
est ones "which l come out. to: keep]
abreast with the progress of science,:
you can, of course, buy: all you need is i
the cash; but' when It comes to the old |
ones.. and the student of literature has i
to have for critical; work ,: the author 1-. |
t&tlve 'first editions." no ' others will do:
even reprints arid critical editions of
modern scholars are liable to error^-
whenit comes to such books you can
not pick them. up"-? in ;the market or
dinarily. You have. here once in a while
a chance to get one at second hand, but
we on- the Pacific Coast ; cannot * avail
ourselves of that chance very . of ten.', By

SACRAMENTO. Sept. 22.â The large
gathcrlEg that crowded Judge Hart's
courtroom this afternoon was highly Â«n
tert&ised while Gavin McNab of San
Frtncisco, a director of both the, Co
ntinental and Phoenix Building and Loan
Â«Â«ociatlone, was en t_e stand for fur
ther cross-examination by Grove * II
Johnson, counsel for former Senator E.
J. Ernmons, now on trial for bribery.. The
ns*n indulged in no bitter personalities
as they did on last Tuesday, but McNab's
keen Intelligence was reflected in every
answer ir.eie. and Johnson was unable to
entangle him in any way.
McN&b. Jn response to . questions by
Johi^on, went over the conversation' held
with Clarence Grange. When Grange told
McXab of the proposition of the four
Senators mace by Joseph Jordan McNab
said if the details were left to him be
r cuid agree to catch Emmons, Bunkers.
"U*r<srht and French. He added that be
had not contributed one dollar to the
fund for entrapping the boodling Quartet.
Johr^cn could not shake McNab on his
testimony of . Tuesday and bis statement
before the Senate Investigating commit
tee. Me Nab said there, was: no difference
la the statement made before the Senate
investigating committee that a Ben Fran
cifco . newspaper made an . arrangement
with ErnmcEs to prosecute Dr. Washing
tan Dodge and & subsequent statement
that Esnmons was going to prosecute
Dodge.-^* - \u25a0*
A moment later McXab added, "Em
ncr.e and the Examiner 'are one." John
ton asked how he made that out, and Mc-
N&b eaid both Emmons and the Exam
iner were - looking for boodle. ,
The witness added that because he and
Dodge had not bowed to the will of the
Examiner In politics and because they
. z i cot championed William R. Hearst,
the Examiner was after them.
Questioned by Johnson, the witness said
he did not Intend to bribe the four Sena
tors, and had not the least idea of break
ing the law. His indentions were to entrap j
then. â
"You as s. lawyer desired to uphold the
law?" &Eked Johnson.
"I did." replied McXab, "and that is
â¢why I am here.**
MOTIVE OF OATXX McKAB. '
"Ana you did not contemplate the brlb
lrg cf any Senator?" asked Johnson. -
"No, but I took â¢measures to' make it
impossible for me to do so. I provided
that I should* be protected; and that the
secret of bribing tfcsee men' should be In
other hands besides mr own. â¢ I arranged
to take the entire responsibility upon zny
etli, but. l arranged that all the things I
w&a dcisg should be known by men whose
characters \u25a0 stood as high as - any in the
State, so that neither you nor any other
attorney could throw aspersions on my
motives when the criminals were brought
into court."
McNab said iht was willing Â« to trap
boodlers again and as often as It could be
accomplished, and added that every step
he took was known by "high-souled"
people.
Johnson asked the difference between
bribery by "low-souied" people and by
"hlgh-souled,"-- to.- which -ileNab replied
that bribery by a "low-souied" person Is
for the purpose of committing a crime,
and bribery by a "hlgh-souled" person Is
to catch a criminal and Xor the public
benefit.
- Johnson said It was bribery in either case.
McNab replied that the State was bene
fited by casting out of legislative halls
that class of men that polluted public life
and degraded the young men.
Johnson Interrupted him and said that
one Harry Bunkers was Indorsed by !f c-
Kab's party, to which McXab said that
was ene of the great political mistakes
sometimes made.
Johnson asked 2Â£cKab If he acted as a
dtisen cr as an attorney for \u25a0 the Con
tinental Building and Loan Association.
HcXab said primarily he acted as a citl
sen. but there was enough human na
ture In him to take satisfaction In doing
the work. The fact, he said, that he
was putting four criminals and a Ban
Francisco paper, who were persecuting:
his clients, into a .trap may have acceler
ated his work. On being pressed for a
direct answer, McXab said he acted as

Shortly after midnight a fire blaied out
In Kn^ass' â¢ boatbuilding .house, situated
on the west side of Third street, between
Bryant and Brannan. It had received a
great start before the -alarm was turned
In. and the whole sky. In that part of the
city was , Illuminated, by tne - blaze.
The fire was discovered by Special "Of
ficer Thorp and' Officer Hyland, who say
that when. they saw the blaze the whole
back portion of the building was aflame.
The building . and contents are ' practi
cally a total loss. The fire was a hot one.
Its fuel being oils, paints, and the dry
wood used in the manufacture of boats.
Tons of water were poured upon the burn
ing structure, and the water tower. %ent
In a powerful stream. The - work of - the
Fire Department saved the buildings ad
joining.
Morgan's oyster-bouse, which adjoins
Kneass's on the north, vu badly gutted
by water. A new apartment-house on the
south, which was unoccupied, was also
damaged by water and smoke.
George W. Kneass,' the owner of the
burned property, estimates his loss at
$35,000. He Is insured ; for about $10,000.
He says he is practically ruined. His
boathouse south of Townsend street
burned down six years ago, his boat fac
tory at the Union Iron Works burned
down last October, ' and two weeks later
bis old factory, which stood on ' the
ground of the premises burned last night,
was also destroyed by fire.'
All of these fires, he says, entailed
heavy losses' on him. The origin of the
fire Is unknown. .
FRANCE ANGRY
AT VENEZUELA
PARIS, Sept. 22.â The offensive attitude
of Venezuela toward M. Talgny, the
French Charge d'Affaires at Caracas, has
aroused Indignation: here. Although the
ministry has not yet taken definite'ac
tion, it Is said in the highest quarters
that Premier Rouvler undoubtedly will
demand that Venezuela disavow the of
fensive action and adopt a course con
formable with the usual courtesies of
diplomatic intercourse. The Venezuelan
authorities are now seeking to show that
their action was directed against M. Talg
ny personally ,'â¢ and not against the French
Government, but the officials here do not
accept thr distinction" between M. Taig
ny*s Dersonal and official capacityl He
has ' high \u25a0 standing at the Foreign Office,
where he recently served. He also aided
Etnbassador Cambon at Washington dur
ing the most delicate phases of the Span
ish'negotiations. Therefore there Is no
Intention' here* to ' permit Venezuela to
make a scapegoat of him. - â
' The official directly charged with band
ling Venezuelan questions explained the
reneral status -of the controversy as fol
lows: -.-!.-..-;. --,:\u25a0:
Venezuela supports - the closing of the
French Cable Company's Inland stations
on* the ground of the decision - of * the
Venezuelan courts. France does not ques
tion the general right of the courts, but
maintains that the decision of the courts
contained nothing authorizing the execu
tive branch to seize and shut up the cable
stations. M. Talgny protested on the
- ground i that . the court's \ decision . did j not
Justify closing the stations. This protest
was not M. Talgny* \u25a0 personally, but fol
lowed specific Instructions from the For
eign Office. Therefore it is Impossible to
raise a personal issue.
It was announced from "Caracas Sep
tember 20 that the Venezuelan Govern
ment had that date made the . following
reply to the protest lodged September 19
by M. Talgny, the French Charge d'Af
faires, against the closing of the land sta
tions of the French Cable Company and
the expulsion of the manager ef the com-,
pany, Brun: , *
The Government bold* dooaments proving
that the French Cable Company baa accepted
the renlt of the Judicial proceeding? brought
against it. The Government la only \u25a0 waltlnit
to establish new relations between |It and thÂ»
company. M. â¢Talgny.'. the. FJ-ench Charg*
A'ACalre*. knows this and therefore the pro.
test can |be only - considered as an act of per
sonal hostility. For ' this reason the Govern
ment will' abstain : from treating with . the
French Government through M. Talgny.
both attorney and individual, and vigor
ously, too. .
On being .asked If he was willing to
break the law to perform a /moral- duty,
McNab said *he had a chance to '\u25a0. catch
four criminals who were defaming his
State. In -order,' to gain profit for them
selves, and he was willing to take the re
sponsibility for. the good it would do.'
JOBDAX REVEALS PLOT.
Joseph F. Jordan was the next witness
called and -went over the details of i his
meetings \ with ; Bunkers In San Francisco
and ; the arrangements made with him to
bribe the . four; accused Senators for a
favorable report on certain building and
loan associations. Jordan's testimony
corroborated that of Bunkers, the '-\u25a0 con

Jordan said he went to; Emmons -after,

HONORS HEAPED
ON SALASSA IN
"I'PAGLIACCI"
It was a greeting- that did honor to
San Francisco, rarest honor, to an ar
tUt. that met Salassa last night at the
Tlvoll. As Tonlo ln 'TPagllaccl". the
grand old man last night reappeared
after an absence of four years. 'TPasr
llaocl" storpÂ«d" for moments at his
first bow between the -curtains. The
encore ehoolc the . house and . after the
repeat - Sf^nor', SaTosaa's " admirers
clapped a cla-d-to-Beo-you-back to him
that is not 'often equaled even at the
Tivoli. ' '" " ' '\u25a0 \u25a0';â¢
It is wholly delightful to say that
the old maestro Is In splendid form, the
voice almost as fresh as one remem
bers It nt Us best, Its Quality, sym
pathy, rare mellowness still unequaled.
Th* Tonlo Is one of his best roles
from every *ld* and last night Salas
ta was In the fullest humor on't.
\u25a0 Anglolcttl was the Canjo. not par
ticularly happy; Miss Tifccl a much bet
ter Ncdda than was â¢ expected, and
SJgnor Moreo a good SllvTd.
Space limitations forbid to say more
here of the "Cavallerla" than that It
Tras Incomparably better than Mr. Con
rlod's production of the opera last sea
son; that Miss Ollva Petrella scored an
astounding * success as Santuzza; the

Grocery :
Pleads Guilty to^
/ Offense:
Mile-Limit 1 Law Is
Enforced Very.
Strictly.
BERKELEY, 'Sept. 22. â Consternation
spread in the fashionable residence dis
trict of Berkeley to-day when-it'be
oame. known that'll.' Van Antwerp, a
solicitor employed by. Goldberg, Bowen
& Co., grocers of Oakland, had pleaded
guilty ln Justice Edgar's court to \u25a0 vio-.
lating the milÂ« limit law by solloitlng
orders for liquor from Mrs. EJ. I* Cor
yell of Fulton street.
It was -supposed that the Oakland
grocers concerned would fight the, case
and the = authorities "of 'Berkeley were
prepared for a long and arduous strug
gle in the courts to convict the accused
man of violating the mile limit law.-
The penalty for the offense is a fine
of not more than $500 or imprisonment
not longer than six months. Sentenoe
is to be pronounced on Van Antwerp
next Tuesday by Justice Edgar. ',--'' l
This Is the lirst time' that the mile
limit law, 'which prohibits the selling
or giving away of liquor within a mile
Of tho -university, has ever been ; in
voked to. prevent the ordering and'de
livery of liquor in Berkeley homes from
grocers or* dealers outside of Berkeley.
The question now confrontlng.'those
families- that desire 'liquor In- their
homes is that of whether the old "suit
case" practice is to be revived. â¢

The Pacific Mail Company's liner City

noon to-day for Panama and way. ports.
As an old Pacific liner the City of Peking
has better passenger accommodations than
is afforded by any other of the Pacific
Mail Panama fleet and in consequence
she aJways is sure of a fair passenger
list. She will take from hÂ«re about 4300
tens cf cargo, ail of it lor coast ports.
To handle the 2Cew York freight the Az
tec is to be put on the run and she will
leave Tuesday or as soon after as pos
sible, for the isthmus direct, -with about
5500 tons of freight. The Aztec will take
a large shipment of California wine for
New York.
The stevedores at the PaciSc Mall
vharf are now busy loading machinery
into the Manchuria, which is taking: to
Japan oce of the largest shipments of
manufactured steel and iron ever shipped
from this port. Included in the shipment
are many locomotive boilers, and getting
them and ether heavy pieces on board the
Manchuria with the antiquated facilities
at tbÂ« disposal of the stevedores is prov

Car Barer In Collision.
A Southern Pacific car barpe collided with
the steam echocner Del Xorte Thursday nipht

age on the coaster. This particular car barge
operates a stern wheel of her own and has
gained reputation for irresponsibilUr almost
equal to that cf the Transit and Taorourh
fare, the Southern Pacific freight ferries,
which, when there is nothing else to run
into, frequently collide with each other. The
barge, the Transit axtd the Thoroughfare are
the three most dreaded menaces to navigation

THE MACHINE AND THE POLICE.
THE proceedings of the Republican city convention at its first
meeting were subjected to riotous interruption by a gang of;
the supporters of the administration which occupied the galle*
ries of the Alhambra Theater. THeir conduct was ruffianly and in-,
suiting to the last degree. They encouraged the minority on the
floor; in obstructing the orderly work of the convention, and 'only
the excellent nerve and patience of the chairman and the majority
members prevented a dangerous collision. The doings of this mob
are part of the bulldozing tactics by which Mr. Ruef proposes to
overawe this city into surrender to him as the boss of itsgovern
*ment for another term of two years. . _ : . .-';/,
The mob was belched forth to its work of disorder from the
dens of filth and vice which flourish by favor of the city government:
It is desirous of another license of two years in which to taint the
fame of San Francisco. The circumstances under which it secured
possession of the galleries to violate the law, by disturbing a public
assemblage, should impress^ every citizen with the extreme danger
which threatens the city. The theater was rented for the use of the
convention. For that -night the building was in. the -same' relation
to the renters, as a private house is to its lessee. V
The gallery doors were locked and could be opened lawfully
only by order of the renter. Mr. Ruef "s mob blocked the street in
front of the theater, and the police unlawfully, without a shadow of
right or authority, forced the gallery doors and admitted the gang of
rowdies and law-breakers. The police had no more right to do this
than they have to force the doors of a private house or a church to
admit a mob. They violated the law which the)' are employed and
paid to defend and enforce. >.
If the mob had proceeded to extreme violence and the building
had been injured or destroyed, the act of the police made the city
liable in damages for the loss. Then we would have had the infu
riating situation of the taxpayers represented in convention to take
measures to protect themselves against misgovernmeht compelled
to pay for damage to property inflicted in the effort of a police
protected mob to prevent their deliberations by violence.
"The Mayor appoints the Police Commissioners, and they con
trol the police. The force takes its cue from headquarters. Sworn
to preserve 'the peace, it breaks the peace. Sworn to protect prop
erty, it destroys property. Sworn to/ keep inviolate, the right of the
people to peaceably assemble, it violates that right, red-handed.
Sworn tp arrest and punish house-breakers, it breaks into a house
under circumstances so flagrant and lawless as to deserve the se
verest punishment.
The mob was sent to the Alhambra Theater to do. a. lawless act,
to commit a crime. It was under orders to effect that criminal pur
pose. Its presence in the street and its disorderly demonstrations
there, publicly advertised its intentions. It wanted entrance to the
theater to make a riot and disturb a lawful meeting. The police,
knowing its purpose, aided it by lawlessly forcing the doors: The
Mayor and his Police Commissioners wink at the outrage, leave the
offending police unpunished, and thereby encourage them to lead
other mobs in other disorders of the same kind.
It is notice served upon the people that they have no rights un
der the law that are sacred against the. gang that runs the city
government. If the police can force the doors of the Alhambra
Theater to admit a mob to break up a convention of;, the people,
they can force the door, of any private house to aHmit a ruffian, to
club the owner's brains out. l 7 : --/ . ,;:-7" 7 '?
This city had some rough experiences in the old days. It was
llhls same sort of partnership between those sworn to, enforce t*he
law and those who violate it that caused the Vigilance "Committee.
A citizen who protested then was shot "down in the- street in -day
light, while the Chief of Police looked on and gave, the murderer a
lift in his buggy. Under the present city government we have al
ready reached those conditions again. Â« The offense Â£>/ * the* police!
at the Alhambra Theater was of the same kind, Tarfd 3 differed only;
in degree.
The people had met to protest against misgovernment. They
had rented the building^ for that purpose. It was their house for
that night. They could admit or exclude whom they pleased. They
rented the galleries and could keep them locked and empty if they
chose. This was their law-protected right,' and its enjoyment /was
criminally denied to them by the police who broke down their door
and admitted a mob sent there to prevent their peaceable protest
against the mob's employers. A mob that goes howling to its work
of breaking the peace of such a meeting is a\ potential murderer.
That mob was as ready , to kill under protection of the police
as it was to commit a breach of the peace. The police had com
mitted the first crime by breaking down the doors. It had served
its masters by this crime, and the mob serving the same masters was
'ready to go further. That it went no further than it did/.was due
entirely to the self-control of the majority members of the conven
tion. ' -.. \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 , \u25a0 ./\u25a0.'\u25a0 [\u25a0\u25a0:'.'\u25a0\u25a0 ,--;\u25a0' :"\u25a0';-- /
It is plain now that the battle for, decent government must be
fought against a' law-breaking boss, a law-breaking Mayor arid "a
law-breaking police. The Republican League must see to it that any
policeman who repeats the crime is arrested by the Sheriff; locked
in the County Jail and brought before a court for punishment.
A STUDY. OF THE : PHILIPPINES.'
>*^\UR Philippine problem has been made an extensive study by
. f . J Henry Parker Willis, professor of economics and politics fin
-V-"^ Washington and' Lee University, and the results of it have 'just
been published in book form. Willis, has had considerable '' newspaper
experience, having been an editorial writer for the' New York Even
ing Post and correspondent of the Springfield Republican, arid of the
New York Journal of Commerce. He has given the subject serious
attention since 1901, and has traveled 2700 : miles in the islands to
familiarize himself with conditions >there. v While his opinions^ do not
wholly coincide with the views of the administration, there are. some
important points of his conclusions which^are confirmatory of the
"wisdom of the policy outlined by Taft as representing the wishes of
a majority of the American people. â¢'
Professor Willis believes that our colonial policy should be not
forithe permanent possession- of the Philippines, but; for the secur
ing to them of self-government and independence guaranteed against
the aggression of any greedy foreign power bent on conquest. He
would have this neutrality of the^ new Filipino Government assured
by international agreement, and believes that such a consummation
is not beyond our diplomatic resources since Secretary Hay proved
such" an arrangement practical by- the precedent- he Helped to estab
lish in regard; to! China. : Such a plan would ma^ke more secure (tho
independence, of the Filipinos' than ouf7owri protectorate, because,
the writer points out, -in-the case of our, being involvediri an Oriental
war the^ Philippines would have to 7be^ evacuated; V Officers
tent to' judge say 'that it would dequife an enormous foree -to hold
them. \u25a0 .\u25a0"' .\u25a0 \u25a0 . :7; - ' ,"â¢ 7/:- r7- ;7/..-77';/^
The study shows that the islands will- never be a desirable field
for colonization by^Americans because the climate is hot ; suitable,
nor will they be useful for opening opportunities for administrative
careers to: young Americans. ; \u25a0The/professor is jeorivinceel ,the Fili
pinos arequite^pable of governing themselves, arid he recommends
that they } be^allowed much latitude in doing this in 'their, own way.

INJURES PASSENGERS.
Collector Stratton Escapes, "Returns
Home and Tells of Disaster.'
Fred S. Stratton. Collector of the Port,
returned from his vacation in the Kla
math River district yesterday morping
and tells of a stage wreck near the Kla
isath River about 7:30 o'clock Wednesday
morning, in which he miraculously es
caped, while two of his companions will
probably die. A Mr. Shuman of San Fran
cisco. Christian name unknown, was bad
ly" bruised and cut in the face, but as far
as known he is not fatally hurt.
Slratton was returning from Klamath
Falls. Or., and" as the sta^e was nearing
the Kl&math River bridge, where the road:
rbh along" -a steep- cliff about 509 feet
above the" rfvw, the -brake cave way and
the passengers started on their wild ride 1
down the steep grade of 150 yards to the i
bridge below.
On reaching toe tura by - the bridge I
t!ie stage was overturned and the
paasergers were thrown . violently
among the rocks, the maddened horses
%. lunging on.
The driver. Thomas Reynolds, and three
pfaEser-gersâ Miss Busse of Allendale. Or.;
ilr. Shuman of San Francisco and Col
lector Etratton, who Was sitting on top flf
the stageâ were thrown over; an embank
ment of about thirty-five feet, and all ex- {
cept Stratton were seriously injured. The j
driver's skull was fractured and Miss â¢
Busse sustained internal injuries. Both <
will probably die. The third, Mr. Shu- 1
man. was badiy bruised and he has cev-'j
cral large cuts on the face. j
As coon Â«.s he was able Stratton climbed j
/.he cliSf and found two of the passengers i
I -Charles Moore Jr., son of the Oregon i
Siate Treasurer, and the other gentleman J
he did not knowâ firmly" pinned under the j
nage. The other two passengers, with J
ihe assistance of the campers, who hap- j
}>ened along at that time, raised the stage Â«
and released its* victims, while Mr, Strat- i
ion walked two miles and telephoned fcr j
a physician. He also got two wagons, in }
which the Injured were removed to Spen-j
eers Station, where the physician arrived j
about Eeven hours later. j
A sharp turn in the road was necessary j
to bring them on the bridge, and at this j
point one of the horses fell and the king |
belt pave way. The five horses, loose from
the stage, dragged the fallen horse nearly j
a half-mile â¢ before they were * finally 1
Flopped by some campers who happened j
&!cng the road. The fallen horse was j

TRYING T0 SAVE
STEPHEN'S HEAD
It developed yesterday that the rea
son why the Board of Health did not
remove Dr. J. I.' Stephen, who is now
under suspension, as effief emergency
surgeon at its meeting on Thursday
\u25a0was because a strong effort is being
made to 'have Stephen's suspension re
scinded by the board and* thus prevent
his official decapitation. The effort Is
likely to cause dissension in the Ruef-
Schmitz camp and is being made de-
JEpit** the fact that the Coroner's jury
characterized atÂ« reprehensible. the con
duct of Stephen In his official capacity
in connection vrith the suicide of Archi
bald Ralston at. Delmonico's. '
Stephen has the aid of Abe Ruef, who
Is bringing all th.c resources at his com
mand to prevent Stephen's suspension
by Dr. Ward, the president of the
Health Board, from being ratified by
the board. Hue* .succeeded in delaying
action at the last meeting through thÂ«
ageacr.'of Dr. Flmon. one of the tntrr/- 1
bers of'thfc board. : Simon is an asao
ciate of Stephen arid is decidedly dis
pleased'with the decision of-Dr.Ward
to oust Stephen from the position which
the latter has disgraced. \u25a0
\u25a0 "What makes it interesting is that
Ward has the support of Mayor Schmitz
In his attitude, -as his Honor has made
up his mind that Stehpcn must go for the
good'of the service, being tired of having
scandal upon scandal heaped upon his ad
ministration. .' . "
Besides Ru'ftirid Simon, Stephen has
Dr." Joseph Pcheim, president . of the
Police 'Jomrriifilon I and a former mem
ber of the ll ealth Board, as one of his
allies in the attempt to thwart the .will
of both Major. Schmitz rand Dr. Ward.
Pohelm- pleaded for an hour. with Mayor
Scbmlt7 that- Stephen be given another
cbanrp on the \u25a0 day before he was sus
pended.' ~" *-- -

The work on the' stations is as complete
as anything; of the could \ be,; the

carefully thought out by the architect,
.William Curlett. who was" given high
credit for the results.- ,
Commissioner LJoy'd said .he could .not

the appreciation^ Captain McDonald had
earned of the citizens. He had "erected
the stations at the,;cost of '. $15,000. J: and

Again, said Lloyd, . Captain ~ McDonald
had made it possible : for \ the^Bohemlan

On motion of of Commissioner Dingee it

Scheduled for tlie % Com

PLAN CLASS SINGLES
California Club Members
Meet To-Morrow in This
Kind of Competition
Many tournaments will be played by the
tennis experts before the rainy season
efts in. The chief event this week will be
a class singles tournament, to be played
to-morrow on the California Club courts.
Two tournaments are scheduled to be
played on the Golden Gate Park courts
to-day. The juveniles will meet in a class
singles event, while the young women will
engage in a scratch doubles tourney. In
the latter event partners have been
drawn. ' - On Sunday week tingles and
doubles tournaments for the champion
ship of the bay counties will be held at
the park. :-Y.->?-
Single class tournaments as a rule
prove popular with the players, and the
event scheduled for to-morrow will at
tract a large entry list. Already twenty-
Eiz players have entered, and the number
will probably reach forty by the time
play is called. The following have affixed
their signatures to the list, the number
-after each name representing the probable
classification :
â¢W. G. Kaowitoa <3). C. G. Kuehn <3). Carl
Gardner ll). Harry Rolfe (1). George Janes (1),
MeH-Ule Long (1). Herbert Long (1). Fran*
Mitchell (1). .Ray Cornell (1), iloulten Warner
<3). Dr. Lovegrov c (2). A. E. Btyfuss (2). B.
F. Kourse (1), Dr. Noble (4). William Mur
phy (4). Henry Mills (2), Major Ducat (4),
GeonrÂ« Cutter (2), H. A. Biddle <2). G. P.
Fuller (2) R. B. Daggett <3), Colonel Eld
ridge (4). Dr. Ford (4). H. C. Burroughs (4),
F. F. White (1). Spencer Grant 13).
Coast Champion George Janes holds the,
first class cup, Albert Kenyon holds the
second class trophy, Charles Kuehn the
third and F. F. White the fourth. Janes
will be in the competition, and several of
the first class men figure they have a
good chance to beat him. Carl Gardner
and Harry Rolfe look to have the best
chance to defeat the champion. Rolfe
beat Janes in straight sets in the July
tournament at San Rafael, and Gardner
has several times during the year taken
the mew champion into camp. Both play
ers were in the last class tournament,
which Janes won quite handily, and un
less his recently acquired honors tend to
make him nervous it would not be sur
prising if he again proved his supremacy.
Albert Kenyon, the second class'cham
picn, is out of town and will not - play
to-morrow. This is the smallest class of
the four, but its members are more evenly
matched than any of the other classes.
Beyfuss, Lovegrove, Cutter and Biddle
are one about as clever as the other,
and all have a good chance to win.
Moulten Warner looks to be the strong
est player in the third class, tie was not
in the last competition, but won the pre
vious one. Kuehn played good tennis in
the last class event, but is rather erratic
Fuller was not at his best when Kuehn
took him into camp, and will do better
to-morrow. Knowlton, the iron man, will
make his reappearance after an absence
of several weeks and j will prove a hard
man for the third class players to beat.
White, the fourth class winner, is a
newcomer at the club and won the first
event he participated Jn. Several new
players will be in the baby class to-mor
row.
The two remaining matches of the
handicap doubles tournament commenced
on the California Club courts last Sunday
will probably go over until October L
The contestants may' get together this
afternoon, but It is extremely doubtf uL
Frank Mitchell and H. Long (owe 15 3-6),
vs. C. Kuehn and H. Biddle (3-6) and the
winners vb. M. Long and C. Gardner (owe
15 8-â¬) are the matches, to be played.
The bay counties tournaments, the last
championship Â«vents of the year, are the
most Important events held on the. public
courts. Last year play was confined to
singles, but two new cups have been
donated by Julius F. Lange, which will be
emblematic of the doubles championship.
The Reuben H. Lloyd cup is held by J.
D. MacGavin, who won the singles tour
nament laet year. Other prizes will also
be given. All matches except the semi
finals and finals will be two sets out of
three, semi-finals and finals three oat of
five. Play will begin ; promptly at , lfl
o'clock October 1, and any player not on
hand when his match Is called will be de
faulted. Entries close September 28. The
committee in charge is composed of J. M.
Baker (â¢kalrman), F. C. Adams, C. B.
Allan, G. I* Baker. C. J. Dunlap. N. W.
Ambrose. Carl Gardner and G. I* Hall. .
The singles event will bring together
George Janes and .Fred Adams, the
former the coast champion and the latter
the State champion and the park's
strongest players. All of the local cracks
and many of the lesser lights will partici
pate in both events.
The annual election of directors of the
California Tennis Club will be held next
Saturday.

ANCIENT PASTIME IS FOLLOWED WITH GREAT ENTHUSIASM AT DEL MONTE
YACHTS ENTER
LAST CONTEST
For some years past Robert Vincent,
now Commodore of the California Yacht
Club, has presented a silver cup to be
raced for by the yachtsmen of the Oak
land Creek fleet in" a handicap "contest.
The trophy is called the Vincent handi
cap cup and will^be raced for to-mor
row. The yacht that makes the best
time over the course, after her handi
cap allowance has been taken ; into ac
count, will be declarea the winner. One
man is allowed for every four ; feet or
fraction thereof of the racing length
of the yachts. The start will be 1 at
about noon on the fire of a single gun.
As it is specially desired to attract a
large number of contestants and to ex
clude none' on "account of the lack of
light sails, the race will be sailed In
cruising rig. All yachts in- the fleet of
the .California Yacht Club are consid
ered as entered. . The time allowances
will be awarded by the regatta com
mittee according to the known, speed
and previous performances of the boats.
The fleet of the California Yacht Club
includes the flagship lola, which is a
yawl and will | be the scratch boat ; .the
sloops Jessie E., Rover, Pactolus, Polly-"
wog, Anita, Lily, Secret, Elthe, Spray,
Occident, Hazel S.\ Kittle, Vega, Mist,
Bachelor, Surf,* Corsair, Shamrock -. III,:
Flirt and Alert;' the yawls Gypsle^Pil
grim, Mabel A. and Idler;the schooners
Frances and Challenge.'*"* To the] fore
going may be added J. J. Sherry's racing
machine Perhaps.
Last year's handicap race for the
Vincent cup * was sailed on October^ 2
in smooth water, and a moderate breeze
and was won by the skipjack Polly wog.:
steered; by ; George Tyler. Â« The"' yawl
lola finished first, but Polly wog's allow
ance of ' twenty-five minutes gave - her
the I cup. The course was reckoned at
twelve nautical" miles.
| 'It is high water, at" 8:84 a. m: to-mor
row at Fort Point and low water at
1:38 at the same place. The tide ' thus
serves: well for a run out to' the j Heads

/BERKELEY,* Sept ,22. â Football
traditions at the .University of Califor

I lutionized by CoacrY "Knibbs of Dart â¢
mouth. "Knibbs has! not only put into
force a new ; style of -play on-the field,
in the varsity teams-p ractice work, but
\by .his stand regarding "rooting" and
> other incidental; features of the foot
ball season, has changed completely the
football atmosphere at the university.
Knibbs apparently has small regard
for "rooting. -as an adjunct to a , foot
ball team, lie discouraged the old habit
of shouting for the squad; thinks lit
"tle of f. manufactured ."; enthusiasm, ap
parently, "aQd is going about the .work
of 'putting, his material into shape for
the big game vwith so" little fuss or
ostentation that students find It hard
to -believe, the -fo'otball. season ,'really is
on in full blast and that the big gams
Is but a, little more than six weeks
away. ' â¢ Â»
Always, in other days; the squad has
practiced on the. old field, in full view
of. a multitude of "rooters", and . Idle
spectators.' Every afternoon the "Toot
hers."., several hundred strong, gathered
on-the bleachers, while the yell leader,
a :- powerful and envied "ofllcial, led the
crowd by the fiour. in .songs, yells and
made to order cheering.
That is all^a thing ot the past. The
change is marked." ids taken to indi
cate the dawn of a football .epoch.
Knibbs, *the coach, will have, none ot\

Tht Coinsrjiers waded right in at Rec
reation Park yesterday afternoon, and be
fcre the came waa ten minutes old they
managed to chase Mr. Bumpus Jones off
the elab by EÂ»ttingr to him for a bunch of
two runs and four blnglera, with 'only 'one
man to the bad. That waa a great lead.
find it waa increased as the game pro
gTessed.
Cates was then requested to get on the
firing line, and he managed to get away
with the next two men cleverly enough.
Along in the third spasm the Commuters
developed another one of those fierce
batting streaks and in a twinkling the
â¢core was increased four runs. Richards
and Francks got doubles in this round,
and two singles and a pass did the rest.
Blexrud celebrated his first victory over
the Giants, though he win have nothing
to crow about, for h!s work was neither
brilliant nor steady. It was a good thing
fcr Blexrud that his team batted like a
Ccck of fiends behind him. ' otherwise he
tvculd have been chased away into the
cellar long before finishing time,
Francks saved the game f o"r the Com
muters in the fifth with a wonderful one-
B3 Â«ab. The Giants had sprung a bat
ting rally and Blexrud was in the high
tltitudes. Two men had already scored
and two were en the sacks, with as many
down, when McLean dispatched a liner
cut to left. It made a noise like a fence
tall, but Francks arose on his toes and
dabbed it with one glimmer, saving the
cay right there. In the ninth Blexrud
again became afflicted with the jimmies.
The Giants began to hit - him and the
Commuters fell down a bit in the field.
Portland thus added two more to Its total
\u25a0ad It came McLean's turn to bat again.
This time the big fellow was- in -the

AUDUBON BOY
EQUALS RECORD
Great Pacer Covers a Mile
in 1 :59!4 Under Adverse
Conditions of the Track
DISTANCES PACEMAKER
Match Proposed With Cham
pion Dan Patch at the
Memphis Track in October
aRBADVILLE. Mass.. Sept TLâ MorÂ«
than 3000 enthusiastic followera of harness
racing saw Audubon Boy pace one of tha
most =. wonderful milts ever made under
adverse conditions at the Headvllle track
to-dayâ the time," 1:53y, equaling the rec
ord ' made by * Star Pointer seven years
ago. Audubon Boy started to beat 2:00%.
. "Weather conditions favored record tlaae,
but \u25a0 the protracted rain . earlier. . In tÂ£*
week left the > track heavy. The assist
anc of a pacemaker was useless, Auduboa
Boy having distanced his pacemaker be
fore the half-mile post was reached. In
making. the trial for the record. James T.
Gatcomb, owner of the chestnut sialllon.
refused to use - a wind < shield or to hayÂ»
a running horse draw a cart with can
vas attached between the wneels In tha
lead, preferring to make the attempt In
the same way Star Pointer gained tha
world's record of 1:59H at the ReadvillÂ©
track seven years ago. This is the pres
ent record with the runner or pacemaker
going at one side. Dan Patch, in 1302.
paced a mile in Readville in l:s3*i under
similar conditions, but as he went to beat
that time it was recorded as a losing per
formance.' Since then Dan Patch has
gained a record of 1:38. This mark was
made with a running horse in the lead.
It was a little after 4 o'clock when
Audubon Boy tried for the record., The*
first quarter was made in 29 secondj and
the next in 2S>i seconds, making the tlmo
for the half-mile 57% seconds. When tha
time was announced the crowd cheered.
The third quarter was reached in l:27}i.
but before this It was seen that whatever
the time of the mile Audubon Boy would
have to make it entirely unassisted. thÂ»
pacemaker then being 100 yards in the
rear. Gatcomb did not make a stirring
drive at the , finish and was Xl*i seconds
coming to the wire, making the time for
the mile.. 159&. just equaling Star.Point
er's" time. -and giving Audubon Boy. that
mark inasmuch as his attempt was 'for
the purpose of beating S:WX.>.
As a result of Audubon Boy's perform
ance to-day, a match between the East
and West is considered probable. Audubon
Boy representing the East and Dan Paten
the TVcst. It is said W. W. Savage, own
er of. Dan Patch, will agree to. a match
at' Memphis, Term.. next month, as Qat
comb is anxious for a race.

"i The West Coast Lumberman cays:
.#b*v There Tiever was a time In the history of
tie lumber trade that the conditions were zncrÂ«
nearly light thaii at the present for thÂ« man
who has lumbtr to sell and who can get cars
*tn which to ship It. Itetail buyers assert
that pne-es are in some cases and places ab
normally high, but the man wlio Is making
the stock tabes the other side and feels secure.
Tho yellow pine man has throughout the year
taken the lead in advancing prices. . There is
a feeling on. the coast. that the list should- be
raised to kÂ»ep In step with competition. One
factor in the activity of. the lumber manufac
'.urlng Interest is the great growth of popula
tion acd demand at home. A laife percentage
of tho lumber cut in the Southern - States is
coj^umed south of the Ohio Elver. The annual
car is Is evidence and will be. a de
laj-injx and -annoying factor perhaps to the end.
of the year. . It is stated that order* for the
coast have been canceled and olaced elsewhere,
T-'here shorter hauls made cars easily obtained.
The volume of lumber and shingles being
leaded .all along the ooaÂ»t 'or Eastern points
la very heavy. . . . . \u25a0:
On September 15 the Loggers'. 'Association
advanced. the price of logs on PugÂ«t Sound 500

the Columbia River logs are plentiful, with
the market not strong. British Columbia log

9Tew York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Sept. 22.â The call money rate
to-Â£ay carried an admonition agalnat specu
ltf.ve excesa and the rise tn ue rate had.
its cSect In the stock market. Operations
were conducted with caution and the market
was under pressure at times, but that the dis
position u> proceed with the upward movement
was -never free from actual necessities of
the money market was still -In evidence./ Call
loan rates advanced to the highest level 'of
the year under the desiand for accommodation
tc carry over- until Monday, which Is required
under the Â£t&ck Exchange rule. On the othei
hand tiie proxniEe was lor a good bank state
n*nt and operators in stocks were lota to
forego the advantage which might. come from
the sentimental Â«ftect of this .to-morrow. . n
appears that-jthe movement of lands â¢on bal
aace to the intÂ»riaÂ»,i during the week ..had
* fcardly been -sufficient to wipe out the small
gain on the week's sub-treasury operations.
Vhe cash reserves of the . banks should seem,
therefore, to be little changed from last week.
â¢The r>rincix>al .interest attaches to the loan
UÂ«ra. There fcave \u25a0 been some withdrawals 01
credits in the sxock market during the week.
but it is not clear whether this has been
due to retrenchment on .the part of some
of the banks or has been due to some re
trenchment on the part of trust company
lams previously takes over. from the banks.
A decrease in the loan item , of the .. bunks
should result in an injnrovement.of the eur
j :us reserve item. &uch an. improvement un
doubtedly would, be welcome as -a martin
fef-i-.r.; t. ruture needs. It is not supposed that
tae movement of funds - to the interior has
ceased for the season. ,(FronÂ» September 25 to
