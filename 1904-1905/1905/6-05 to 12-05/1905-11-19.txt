*""^tf N anomaly which often struck inÂ«
f [ In the character of my friend
I I Sherlock Holmes -was that, al-
1 tn Â° u '' n *n his methods of thought
he Â«aj the neatest and most
methodical of mankind, and. although
also he affected a certain quiet primness
of dress, he was none the leas in his
personal habits one of the most untidy
men that ever drore a fellow lodger to
distraction. Xot that I era in the least
conventional in that respect myself." The
rough-and-tumble work in Afghanistan,
coming on the top of a natural Bohe
miani&m of disposition, . haa made tne
rather more lax than bents a medical*
man. But with me there is a limit; ? ario"
when I find a man who keeps his cigars
in the coal ecnttle. his tobacco in the toe
end of a Persian flipper and his.~una*t J
ewerable correspondence transfixed by>ai;

wooden mantelpiece, then I begin to give

â¢ and proceed to adorn the , opposite wall
with a patriotic V. R-, done In bullet
- pocks. I felt strongly that neither the .at
mosphere nor the appearance of our room
was Improved by It.
Our chambers were always, full pt chem
icals and of criminal relics which had a
-way of wandering into unlikely position*.
and of turning up in the butter dish or in
even less desirable olaces. But. -his pa
pers were mr great crux. He ' had a
horror of destroying documents, espe
cially those which were connected with
his past rases, and yet it was only once
in every year or two that he would.mus
ter energy to docket and arrange them r :
for, as , I have mentioned . somewhere in
these incoherent memoirs, the outbursts
of passionate energy^ when he performed
the remarkable feats with which 'his
name Is associated were followed by.re
actions of lethargy during which he would
lie about with his violin and - his* books,'
hardly moving save, from eofa* to \ the
table. Thus month after month, -hiÂ« vpa
ptrs accumulated, until every 'corner, of
the room was stacked, with.' bundles of.
manuscript which were on no acbount to
be burned/, and which could not' be 'put
away save by their owner. . One'wlnter*s
.flight, as we sat together by the .fire, -I:
ventured to suggest to â¢ him that, as he
had finished* pasting extracts -.into his
commonplace book,' he might : employ- the
next two hours in making our room a lit-,
tie more habitable. He could not deny the
justice , of my request,* so with a rather
rueful face he went off. to his .bedroom;
from which he returned presently* pulling
ia large â¢ tin box behind him. , : Thls " he
Placed in the middle f>f ; tbe 'floor, and,"
â¢equalling down upon a stool in front of
it. he threw back ; the lid. I could see
that it was already a third full of bundles
of- papers- tied up with red. tape,'.lnto
separate packages.

Intention of continuing ; - a novel which I
was reading. The book, however, had
been left in the bilMard-rootn. so I pulled
on my, dressing' gown and started off to
VgÃtlt., 1 ,;; ,-;\u25a0..
"Â«"' In order to reach the billiard-room I
â¢ had to "descend a fight of stairs and then
to "cross, the head of a passage which led
j to, the library, and the gun-room. You caa
'imagine' my surprise when, as I looked
down .this corridor. ; I saw a glimmer of
, light; coming from the "open door of the
library. I had" myself extinguished the
-lamp* and closed â¢ the door before coming
â¢to bed.; Naturally my first thought was
{of; burglars. "The corridors at Hurlstone
\hayeÂ» their walls largely decorated with
trophies of - old * weapons. From ; one of
these I -picked â¢ a battle-axe, and then.
; leaving my \u25a0 candle behind me. I " crept on
tiptoe down the passage and peeped in at
the- open, door. . . 'v- \
- V â¢Brtmton, the' butler, was in the li
brary. He was sitting, fully dressed, in
an easy, chair, with' a slip of paper which
looked like a map upon this -knee; and his
forehead sunk forward upon his- hands In
- deep â¢ thought.* I stood dumb' with aston
ishment..watching him from the darkness.
A small taper on the edge of the table
shed a' feeble light, which sufficed to show
mo that he was fully dressed. Suddenly;
\u25a0*, as I looked, he rose from his chair and
walking over to bureau at the aide he
unlocked it â¢ and drew out one of the
'drawers. 2; From this he took a paper %
and â¢ returning . to his seat he flattened it*
out "> beside - the taper on the edge ; of- the
table., and , began to study: It "lwith mlnu te,
attention. . : My . indignation 'at â¢ this 'calm
examination of v our family documents
.overcaae me so far that 2 took . a step
forward, and ' Brunton, looking up. saw
me standing In the doorway. He sprang
his feet, his face turned livid with "
fear, and he thrust into his breast the
chart-like paper .which he had been orig
inally-studying.
.'",* "Sol", said I. "This is how you "repay
the trust -which we have reposed In you.
You will leave my service to-morrow." .
> " "He bowed with the looktj of a man
who Is utterly crushed and slunk past me
withput a word.. The taper was still on
the table, and by Its light I glanced to
see' what the; paper was which . Brunton
3 had taken from, the bureau. To my sur
\u25a0 prise.' it ' was nothing of any Importance
at all. but simply a copy of the questions
', and : answers , in tbe . singular observance
"called the Musgrave Ritual. It. is a. sort
of ceremony peculiar to onr family, which
each Musgrave for centuries past has
"gone* through on his coming of ageâ a
; thing : of private Interest. . and perhaps , be
Â» some .little ' Importance to . the archaeolo

" ",*lf you : think it really necessary/ j he
-answered." with some hesitation. To con
i.tlnue my. statement, however:". I relocked
i the' bureau, using the. key which Brunton
had left., and I, had turned to go when. l
was ' surprised to flnd that the butler had
returned and was standing before me.

"'"Only a week, sir T' he cried. In a
despairing voice. "A fortnightâ say at
least a fortnight I"
" ' "A week." I repeated, "and you
may consider yourself to have been
very leniently dealt with."
" 'He crept away, his face sunk upon
his breast, like a broken man, while I
put out the light and returned to my
room.
" Tor two days after this Brunton
was most assiduous -in his attention to
his duties. I made no allusion to what'
had passed, and waited with some curi
osity to see how he would, cover his
disgrace. On the third morning, how
ever, he did not appear, as was his cus-.
torn, after breakfast to receive my in
structions for the day. As I left the

"Come back to your duties when you
are stronger."
" 'She looked at me with so strange
an expression that I began to suspect
that her brain was affected.
"""I am strong enough, Mr. Mus
grave." said she.
We will Bee what the doctor
says," I answered. "You must stpp
work now, and when you go downstairs
just say that I wish to see Brunton."
The butler Is gone," said she.
Gone! Gone where?"
He is gone. No one has'seen him.
lie is not In his room. Oh, yes, he. is
gone, he is gone!" She fell back
against -the -wall â¢ with shriek after
shriek of laughter, while I. . horrified
at this sudden hysterical attack, rushed
to, the bell to' summon help. The girl
was tuken to her room, still screaming
and sobbing, while I made Inquiries
about Brunton. There was no doubt
about It that he had disappeared. His
bed had not been slept In, he had been
seen by no .one since he had retired
to his room the night before, and yet
it was difficult to see how he could
have left the house, as both windows
and doors were found to be, fastened in
the morning. His clothes, his watch,
and even his money were in his room,
but the black suit which he usually
wore rvas missing. His slippers, too,
were gone, but his boots were left be
hind. Where, then, could Butler Brun
ton have gone In the night, and what
could have become of him now?
" 'Of course we searched the house from
cellar to garret, but there was no trace
of him. It Is, as I have said, a labyrinth
of an old house, especially the original
wing, which is now practically uninhabit
ed; but we ransacked every room and cel
lar without discovering the least sign of
the missing man. It was incredible to me
that he could have gone away leaving all
his property behind him, and yet where
could he be? I called In the local police,
but without success. Rain had fallen on
the night before, and we examined the
la.wn and the paths all round the house,
but in vain. Matters were in this state,
when a new development quite drew our
attention away from the original mys
tery.
" 'For two days Rachel Ho wells had
been so ill, sometimes delirious, some
times hysterical, that a nurse had been
employed to sit up with her at night. On
the third night after Brunton's disappear
ance the nurse, finding her patient sleep
ing nicely, had dropped into a nap in
the armchair, when she woke In the early
morning to find tie bed empty, the win
dow cpen and no signs of the invalid.
I was instantly aroused, and, with the
two footmen, started off at once in "search
of the missing girl. It was not difficult to
tell the direction which she had taken,
for. starting from UDder her window, we
could follow her footmarks easily across
the lawn to the edge of the mere, where
they vanished close to the graVel path
which leads out of the grounds. The lake
there is eight feet deep, and you can Im
agine our feelings when we saw that the
trail of the poor demented girl came to
an end at the edge of it.
*' *Of course, we had the drags at once,
and pet to work to recover the remains,
but no trace of the body could we find.
On the other hand, we brought to the, sur
face an object of a most unexpected kind'/
It was a linen bag which contained within
it a mass of old rusted and aiecolored
metal and several dull-colored pieces of
MARGARET E. SANGSTER'S TALKS
(Cop*yright, 1905, by Joseph B. Bowles.)
THE plain truth is that to study
music is not the grind It used to
be. Priscilla,. daughter of Phyl
lis, approaches the piano by the
scientific modern method and by
easy gradations. Phyllis used to be
driven to her practicing and it was the
bugbear of her life. With a watch by
her side, or an eye on the clock, she
sat on the backless music stool and
pounded away, putting her little foot
on the loud pedal that the noise might
be deeper, counting one, two, three,
four, five, over and over, till she went
on like an automaton, fingers strum
ming, voice marking time, and loathing
it all the while. Very severe teachers
thumped little hands if they made mis
takes. Very rigid mothers ipxacted the
full tale of half hours and whole hours,
and scolded the luckless girl who lin
gered on the way from school and was
tardy in her duty to her piano.
As for the neighbors, they hated It,
too. Nothing was mpre. torturing .to
sensitive ears than the dreary repeti
tion of five finger exercises, to the
right, to the left, for every house had
its piano, and every family with daugh
ters had several of them drilling at
one and the same time.
"I would rather study astronomy,"
said Phyllis, pouting, when her mother
told her that her muelc lessons were
to begin "next Monday."
"Astronomy," replied the mother, "is
a mere amusement. . Music is a neces-'
Â»lty In education."
Phyllis had no ta6te for It, but that
made no difference. -/
We have learned a better way, _as well
as adopted a better method, and Priscilla
of the golden braid Is the gainer. Her
mother, Phyllis, looks on in pleased ap
preciation when she finds that before
ever she touches the keyboard .: she ' Is
taught the value of different notes*. Is
pebble ; or' slapx./ . This , strange \u25a0. find , was ;
all that we could get .from the mere, and.
although I we v made \u25a0 every pofaible ; search 1
and inquiry yesterday, we kriow'nbthlng^
cf tho, fate either "of Rachel; Howells for;
of Richard Brunton. ; The country/police
are at their wits' end. and I have, come,
up to you as a last resource.'
"You can imagine, Watson, with what ,
pa^rernesE I listened to 'this extraordinary
sequence of events, and endeavored to
piece them together, and ! to devise some
common thread upon which i they might/
all ha off. ; The butler "' was â¢'. gone.' The-;
maid was gon^.v The maid had' loved Uhe
butler, but had i afterward had cause'to
hate him. She was of Welsh blood,/ fiery*
and passionate. She had been terribly t
excited Immediately . after his disappear
ance. She had flung into the lake a bag
containing some curious contents. These;
were all factors which had to be taken
Into consideration, and yet none of v them
got quite to the heart of the matter.
What was the starting point of this chain
of events? There lay the end of this
tangled line.
"'I must see that paper, Musgrave, -
said I. 'which this butler of yours,
thought it worth his while to consult,
even ut the risk of the IO3S of his
place.' :
'"It is- rather an absurd business,
this ritual of ours.' tie answered. - 'But
it has at least the savisig grace of an-*
tiquity to excuse It. I have a copy
of the questions and/ answers here .if
you care to run your eye over them.' -
"He banded me the very paper I have

to submit when he came to man's es

"'The original ihas no date, but it is

can be of little help to you In solving

'"At least,' said I, 'it gives, us/an

that 1 the Musgrave who held the secret

IT is always Interesting and some
times instructive to see a man as he
sees himself.
"There is not," insists Mr. Ruef, a
little dramatically, "a better man in
San Francisco than I am!"
'Til print that," I say.
"Oh, no; not that I. said it."
"Oh, yes; I'm interviewing you, you
"But â '\u25a0
"You said the same thing In your
speech at the Alhambra â your big
speech â and to a bigger audience than
you have now."
"No; I didn't say thatâ exactly. I
eald that there is not a more 'moral'
man. You see how accurate my mem
ory Is â even for one little word!"
Mr. Ruef is telling me he possesses
all the lesser virtues; that he doesn't
drink, he doesn't smoke, he doesn't
gamble, has never been on a race
course in his life, nor slept from under
the paternal roof one whole night un
less he was out of the city; that he has
not been to the theater In a year; that
he is in short the personification of in
dustry, application and personal excel
lences.
Mr. Ruef Is still smarting from the
just concluded political affray.
No man has been more execrated,
more bitterly denounced, more violent
ly attacked than he has been in the
past few weeks, and, although he is not
himself without a lively talent for
vituperation, the cuts he got in the
wholesale slashing are smarting keenly
even yet.
1 owe it to my sense of justice â and
perhaps to him â to tell why he made
his claim to so much goodness.
"It's a weakness of mine to want the
people I know and who know me â the
people I come in personal contact with,
that I shake hands with, to think well
of me. For the opinion of the people
who only hear about me and read about
xnt- I care nothing, but for that of those
I meet Ido care. For example, yester
day I had not met you. I had never
scon you to know you, and I cared
nothing about what you might think
of me. To-day â now that I have met
you, now that you know me, I do
care. I want you to think welf of me;
to Jojow me as I am. I feel that way
about everybody."
A philosopher informed the London
smart 6et 6O long ago as the morning
of August -6, 1712, through the medium
of the Spectator, that: ""The love of
praise Is a passion deeply fixed in the
mind of every extraordinary person."
By that axiom Mr. Ruef himself fur
nishes me with one more evidence that
he is an extraordinary person.
It is because he is an extraordinary
person that I call to see him.
Only an extraordinary person could
do what he has done, so on that point'
there can be no clash of opinion, I be
lieve.
I wouldn't have believed that fact
could be so much like fiction if I
hadn't seen It for myself.
I have been reading in the political
"best sellers" of the moment descriptions
of fictitious bosses and their ante-rooms
(I em not. If you please, "using that In
the poker sense) and not until I call on
Mr. Ruef do I realize how closely fact
sometimes approaches fiction.
Mr. Ruefs ante-room is like a page out
of a "best seller."
It Is packed with visitors seeking an au
dience of "just one word," begging for
"on!y a moment," seeking the privilege
"to deliver a message from buzz-buzz
buzz"âwhispering impressively in the
office boy's car the magic name guaran
teed as a password.
So. too. is the narrow corridor packed,
and another room on the other side of
the private office In which Mr. Ruef sits
receiving and dismissing his courtiers
with almost automatic speed and pre
cision.
Speed and precision Is needed, for they
come In procession. His Is almost a
continuous performance.
I don't know, perhaps only Mr. Ruef
and his attendants know, how many more
rooms there are packed with hard-breath
ing courtiers swelling with importuni-,
ties.
My rocm, however, never seems to
empty. As fast as the suppliants dis
appear through one door Into the private
office, never to return, there come new
ones through the other door, like grain
running into a hopper. *
There are not, of course, chairs enough
to go round, and they sit on the corners
end edec-s of desks and drape themselves
against the walls, spitting meditatively
upon Mr. Ruefs office carpet and oblit
erating the deposit with slow, careful
foot. Ingratiating themselves conversa
tionally " with Mr. Ruefs sister, who ' is
his stenographer, and who receives their
advance* with well-sustained - indiffer
ence, transferring their ineffective bland
ishments to Mr. Faef's father at another;
desk, and. when they fall there again,
seeking the favor of the office boy, who
if, in his* own way, a master of diplo
macyâa paragon among office boys.
All the types are here that you find in
a cartoonist* album or between the cov
ers of the best sellerâ even the purple
wight who hoarsely whispers alcoholic
confidences to the general public from be
hind the back of his hand. Every now
and then the door osens a wee crack and
gives glimpses of duplicates and new
typesâ now a bulbous ruddy nose in
serted from the corridor, again a sullen
while face with the impatient inquiry .
"Any chance yet?" and a jerk of the head
toward the inner room. .
My turn comes, most graciously, out
of turn and all too soon, for I am
finding joy Jn the pageant. I too pass
through the magic door.
You should find a boss. If only you.
could depend em the cartoonists and
common report, like the renowned
Joey Bagstock, "rough and tough and
dev'lish sly."
Yet Mr. Ruef is, none of these
things â apparently.
He Is suave, as smooth as cream,
amiable and affable and frank â almost
ostentatiously frank.
He offers me a luxurious little hand,
very white and soft, in an almost
caressing handshake, and asks cor
dially:
"What can I do for you? "What
would you like to know? Where shall
we begin?"
A boss â again according to the car
toonist and common report â is, usually
coarse, sometimes flamboyant, and al
ways overbearing, a master making
his mastery felt.
And again Mr. Ruef is none of these.
He is a little man, dark, rather deli
cately constructed, fastidious and
sybaritic, and conciliating, almost fe
line, in manner.
He is a little man, but not insig
nificant. The center of a group of men
in a room he is still the principal fig
ure, the one that through some curious
force of personality stands out most
strongly and engages your attention.
He Is very well tailored, not with the
studious modishness of the clubman,
but in smart business fashion, and
without any- glitteringâ evidences yof
affluence on waistcoat, cravat or. fin
i
ger.
He has the large eyes of the senti
mentalist, and, indeed, confides to me
that he is sentimental â entirely too
much moved by sentiment for a practical
politician; but there are times when
the eyes narrow to a beady glitter in
resentment, displeasure or concentra
tion. ' '
Contradicting the sentimentality of
the eyes is the uncompromising width
of the jowlâ the mark of the boss the
world over.
The tout ensemble is that^u)f the
French Jew. I hazard the guess and
-. \u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0 â¢..
he tells me I am right, very nearly
right, that his father and mother are
Alsatians, and the home tongues, are
French and German as well as Eng
lish. He is the type of the shrewd;
sharp, successful Jew, as distinguished
from the dreamer-artist type so beau
tifully portrayed In Rabbi Nieto.
"Why did you go into politics?" I ask
Mr. Ruef.
"At* first for lnterestl I thought every
man should take part In politics. I was
enthusiastic and full of theoriesâ l was
young then, only 'twenty-one." -.
"Thenâ"
"Then for revenge."
"Wellâ you can't stand still In any
thing. I am in' and I must stay in. A
man in my positionâ"
"In politics?"
"Yes; in politics, must either fight all
the time to hold his place or give it up.
It will be taken from him.' That's the
game. In politics you are always making
enemies and you can't sit down and let
them get the best of youâ at least I can't.
So, as long as I AM in politics that if
why I stay-in."
Mr. Ruef is frankâ even to the verge
' ' â¢ \u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0 .
of Ingenuousness.
. . . ,;â¢-,\u25a0;.\u25a0
The man at the top can afford to say
what he pleases, even as the king may in
dulge his eccentricities.'
I am come to Interview him, I tell him,
in his character of Boss.
. He lifts a protesting hand In denial, but
it Is, half-hea-ted denial, as unconvinc
ing-as the shake of the head and the
pleased smile of a pretty woman \qheh
you tell her she is -pretty.
It is only good manners for the pretty
woman to protest. t
It Is only discretion for the Boss to
lift that, unconvincing hand.
With the next breath we are off full
tilt In a discussion of bosses in general
and our Sari Francisco -boss in particu
lar.
"Things are done differently out: here
to the way they; are done In the East,"
Mr. .Ruef explains. "When I ; made\'my

âit was the first time In the history of
politics that a reputed boss ever did such
a things that "he ever so cpenly declared
himself.*' . -
Under a bombardment of .rapid-fire
. interruptions he tells me of his entry
into politics. The interruptions disturb
him not. In the least. .He signs .let
ters, dictates' telegrams, gives orders,
answers his phone,' disposes with a few
quick wordsâ always suave, always
friendly, good-natured, to the pointâ
of the callers who burst through one
door and then the other, going on all
the while with the story to me wltlfout
losing a syllable or a comma.
. "I remember my first experience in
politics, because it was so picturesque
that It made an indelible impression on
me. IX was twenty years ago. and I
wasn't quite 21. I was studying law.
I. had graduated from the universityâ
one of the youngest students ever grad
uated from It.; I finished the grammar
school course when I was 11. I grad
uated from high school at 14. I got my
university degree before I was 19.
Quick work? .Well, yes; but my mind
works quickly â it wasn't by digging
that I got through."
It works, indeed, as I can see in his
dispatch of; business with a sort of
darting, lightning-like rapidity. He
â mpletes your thought before you
,ye expressed It. \u25a0
"Boylike, I. was interested In politics
and full of theories. ' I was enthusiastic
about doing my duty'in politics, taking
a part In the Government and all that
sort of thing, so, when I saw a little
notice in the paper that the Republican
club of my "precinct would meet that
night I couldn't wait until it was time
to go to that meeting. I went downâ lt
was Just a few blocks from my horne â
to 915 Sansome street. I remember the
number. well, and when I got there, al
though it was "early, so early that I
thought the meeting hadn't commenced,
I found everything dark. The door was
locked. .1 hunted around for a bell or
a, knocker, but couldn't find any, so I
pounded on the door. By and by a
man opened Itâ >-a big*, hard-looking fel
low, with a scar across his face as
though he'd been slashed with a cut
lass. He had a lantern in his hand and
opened the =door just wide enough to
get his nose though and see who was
outside.
."'What d'ye want?' he asked.
'"'I came to attend the meeting;* I
:sald. w L*\ i- - \u25a0. â¢..* -;"-J V-
'ORâ um-in â ye-es. Is that so? Who
areTyou? What's, yer name? ' Where'd
you live? What d'you want to do at
the meeting?*
\u25a0"I â¢ told him all he wanted to know
about -myself and . that I thought of
joining the club.
'\u25a0\u25a0 " 'Ohâ ye-es.' Then he thought a while.
Then he opened the door until the
crack;was wide enough to let me. in,
and said, 'Well, the meeting's over, but
come : In, . anyhow.*..
"There were a couple more men sit
ting around, a rusty \u25a0 stove. . The man
with tho scar put the lantern down and
told the otherfuwho I was and what I
.wanted..*. Then they started in and
told me .what- a fine meeting they'd had,
\u25a0 how much enthusiasm there was, what
a ; large. attendance, what business had
\u25a0been done, and all .that sort of thing.
V "It /was' a queer :. place, and I
wouldn't have been surprised if I'd
gone , down through a trapdoor, but
queer as" it was I didn't know that the
three or. four men were all of the Re
publican club and the account of the
meeting purely Imaginary.
' "â¢What's the matter,*,; the scar-faced
man asked, 'with makin,' this young
feller secretary?' I started to decline,
and he "asked, 'Can you write?' I - ad
mitted \u25a0-; I could write my name : any
how, but asked how about the secre
tary already in action.
\ "'Oh, that's all right. Xever mind
him. Say, you .writea notice of this
here meeting- and send it to the papers,'
that's what you can do.'
'', "I. thought I w ; as getting Into politics
pretty 'fast,* and was so pleased that I
wrote out three separate accounts of
the meeting â as they described It to
me,' .telling about the membership of
140 and the enthusiasm, and took -them
down to the papers. The next morn-
Ing I had the satisfaction of. -seeing
them in the papers just a3 I had writ
ten them.. That was the making of
the club. The (Republicans on the out
side ' thought it was too good to be
overlooked with all those members,
a:irl the voters in the" district didn't
want to be left out of it, and the result
was* 1 It really did grow until it con
,trolled_ the "district.
"That was my first .lesson in pol
itics. - ' Sb^jH
':Thc-n they made me a delegate from

tion was or what a; delegate 'had to do
or 'could do.
/"At- the convention my scar-faced
friend, voted .us in blocks. 1. didn't
know just what to do. about it. -I
didn't like it. I wanted to do my own

for, myself.. '* â¢

"I told him I thought I had,' and
that rd ; do*my r own voting. He wanted
to ; know, how; I was going:' to .vote." il
told him, and as It happened to be h!Â«
way that time he said it was all right,
to go ahead if I Just .wanted the ex
ercise of doing my own. voting. I
didn't like the arrangement, so I looked
around to ~ see what I could do. I
\u25a0.found a man who was marked as a
lamb for sacrifice and I took hold of
his name. When It came up I got up
'and spoke to the convention, making a
fight against the programme. "When X
got up I didn't know what I was go
ing against, but before I'd beea talk-
Ins very long I saw several guns come
,out of pockets and knew there was
trouble brewing. Nothing serious hap
pened, but I got my man nominated
and I broke the slate. That was tho
first time I took independent action.
"After that I took no very actrra
part In politics until I urged John H.
Nelson for State Senator In '90. Then
I found that although the district was
strongly Republican the Republicans
â¢were workine- against him â to defeat
me. I didn't like. that, so I went to
work in' politics, giving one hour a day
to my law business and the rest of tho
time to:, the campaign â and Nelson was
elected.",
"And you were la politics for
revenge.'*^ "H ;
"Yes."
"And then you formed the Union Labor
party?" -
"No. don't say formed. I only organ?
ized it"
One word Is as good as another hereâ
and Mr. Ruef has his own way.
"What makes," I ask him, as an au
thority, "what makes a successful poli
tician?"
"Four things," he answers. "He must
have ability, he must have honesty. hÂ»
must have energy, he must hayÂ« consid
eration for thosa around him." ,
\u25a0 "What makes the successful boss?"
"I am not a boss," he deprecates.
"Butâ"
"Not in the ordinary sense: not what
13 commonly known as a boss. I never
dictated to any man In my life."
"But you have advised and suggested?"
"Yes."
"And the victory is yours!" â
Mr. Ruef leans back in his office chair,
and interlaces his white fingers and
smiles, and I smile, too.
Who could help it?
His smile Is so much like thÂ» "smlls
on the face of the tiger," in that ditty
about "a young lady of Niger."
Mr. Ruef has made a study of bosses, as
we each of us make stUcltes of our. own
kind, artists of other artists, writers of
writers, merchants of merchants and ar
tisans of artisans.'
He says: "In the. East the methods of
bosses are too brutal."
"They use the whip," I agree.
"It is better to conciliate."
"How far," I want to know, "does thÂ»
power ef the boss extend?" It seems a
tremendous power as I sit there looking
on, even through one brief hour.
"Only so far as he has the confidence
of the people who follow him."
"In what is its strength?"
, "In giving others what they want for
themselves, and not asking anything
from them for himself."
"How have you made your following
loyal to you?"
"I never lie about what I can or can-^
not do. and I always do what I can."
We walk out of Mr. Ruefs private of
fice together through a passage of out
stretched hands and detaining appeals.
One wise suppliant uses the elevator
for an ambush. .
Three more engage In button-hollny
in the short passage from elevator tÂ»
street.
On the very threshold a man lies In
wait with his plea. -
Half-way across the street a man
joins us for a moment.
On the first corner a small boy bobs
up with:
"Here's yer ev'nin* paper. Mister
Ruef," sinks the half -dollar ,; passed
over to him and darts away.
A man beckons Mr. Ruef into a drug
store for a star chamber conference.
"It is never safe to overlook any
one," says Mr. Ruef casually.
"You can never tell -how a careless
slight will be treasured against you."
Ten step 3 from the door ''another
newsboy greets him with, "Was waltin*
f er you, Mr. Ruef," and another even-
Ing paper goes Into his overcoat
pocket.
From California street to Market the
Ruef derby is in the air, the Ruef smile
has no chance to relax.
"I think, that without exaggeration I
can say I vknow 100.000 people In San
Francisco.'* Mr. Ruef explains. ,

his knee obsequiously and removes his
hat with a .flourish almost theatrical.
"I wish." sighs Mr. Ruef, "I had somo

My wrist gets tired."

IÂ«JTIE passing: cf San Francisco's old
Custom-house, that once marked
the commercial . center of the
. Western metropolis,, is furnishing
an interesting theme for the
ever reminiscent pioneer, whose dally
course of travel lies in the neighborhood
of the rapidly disappearing building, on
the corner of Washington and Battery
streets. Within the next six weeks, if the
contractors. .fulfill their agreement, the
structure will have been completely re
moved from the site on -u-hich it has
srtood for fp:t>' odd years. In the place of
this arieSent building, that was ence re
garded as the niort magnificent of San
Francisco- architecture, there is to'risc a
modern one f cr The future accommodation
of the Fetterai forces that guard the rev
enue interfsts of this i>ort. Passing from
the sight of. the gray-haired pScneer does
not mean that it will pass from his mem
ory, for 'ira'ny of the traditions of the
early days of California had thÂ«ir origin
in the locality of that building and are
ever fresh in .the mind of the man who,
with his courage, energy and seal, as
sisted in" laying .the foundation of San
Francisco's greatness of ttS-Htlay. and the
future. â¢ . " '
As the pioneer pauses -before llie Wash
ington street building to -fatten the pro
gress of the work of dernolishment his
mind reverts to the early '53's, when the
citizens cf San Francisco rejoiced over
the herald news that the Washington
Government had decided to build for this
port a most-needed Custom-house; and he
recalls vividly the celebration that at
tended the completion and formal occu
pancy of the structure in 1554 and the in
cidents that followed in the history of the
latter. This venerable pioneer also re
members the city's tirst Custom-house, an
adobe building situated in Portsmouth
square, where Â£an Francisco's famous
Vigilance Committee inaugurated its work
of reform by hanging John Jenkins in the
early morn of June 11. 185 L He will tell
you also of the four-story brick building
on the corner of Montgmery and Califor
nia streets, over which the revenue flag
floated for a time, until the terrible con
flagration of .May 4. 1851. which swept
away that and many other of this city's
places of business; and if you are inter
ested in his tales of the past he will de
scribe to you how the old Custom-house,
now being torn down, was built partly on
piling, that was necessary in order to in
sure one end of the building a firm foun
dation at what was then the water's edge
cf San Francisco narbor.
He readily recalls when General R. P.
Hammond, the first Collector of the Port
to occupy the building, entered upon his
duties in the then newly constructed Cus
tom-house, and will recite to you how it
happened that exterior portions of the
building were altered in IS6S after it had
been nearly shaken off its foundations by
a terrific earthquake shock. He knows J-
W. Probasco, the oldest employe in the
local cuetome service; likewise John H.
Boden and J. S. Mattoon, the well-known
brokers, both of whom were employed in
the Custom-house at the corner of Bat
tery and Washington streets during the
early years of its history, and rank with
Probasco among the few living of the old
guard. I
\u25a0 -Perhaps ttie pioneer's memory may
he a little hazy in the matter of ex
act dates of Incidents connected with
the old Custom-house, but. as a whole.
his reminiscences will prove Interest
ing as well as instructive to you, and,
if you show him the due deference, by
listening. you will afford him Infinite
-pleasure.
Kvery old building in San Francisco,
especially those that were erected be
fore or during the early fifties, is
closely associated in some way with
the exciting events of pioneer days.
The old Custom-bouse has this dis
tinction. It was built at the end of
one of the city's earliest stages of
prosperity, at the very time when
financial depression was threatening
by reason of over speculation in ar
ticles of commerce. The city's realty
values had advanced to $28,880,000;
'she boasted of nineteen banking firms,
with an annual business record of
â¢ $80,000,000; she had ICO hotels and
public houses, ten public schools, eight
een churches, twelve dally â¢ papers and
several monthly magazines and half a
. dozen theaters. She had also acquired
a cas and water plant and was en
joying an outbound mail service that
"averaged 1,000,000 ' letters . annually.
The annual imports of the port to
taled about 730.000 tons of goods, val
ued at 535,000,000 and netting the Gov
â¢ erftment in the way of duties nearly
$3,000,000.
In recognition of the rapidly grow
ing: Importance of San Francisco, Con
gress, two years before, had voted her
.a new Custom-house and had appro
priated necessary funds for strength
ening with piling a water-soaked por
tion of the site a.t the corner of Wash
ington and Battery streets. Appre
ciating the Immediate need of a new
Custom-house to take the place of one
that had .been but recently destroyed
by fire, the Government, pending the
construction of the building at Wash
ington and Bittcry streets, erected an
other at the corner of Sansome and
Sacramento strcc-is, over which the in
ternal revenue P.&z was floated for the
first time in November, 1853. The con
struction of the building at Washing
ton and Battery streets was to have
proceeded as rapidly as possible, but,
as is usually the case with Govern
ment contractors, the work lagged at
limes bo noticeably that the anxious
citizens joined In completing: it after
having assisted in selecting its ma
terial.
At its completion in the latter, part
of IS5< the new Custom-house was
voted by the populace of San Fran
cisco to be the most, magnificent build
ing in the West. The formal opening
of the customs offices was attended
with a great deal of formality.. Col
lector cf the Port R. P. Hammond, Sur
veyor cf the Port John T. McLane and
Naval Officer W. B. Farweil consti
tuting themselves a committee to wel
. come the visiting public and associa
tion cf customs, brokers to the new
' structure. Speeches andÂ«winc-drinklngr
marked the occasion and the first
morning on the floor of'the new build
ing had more of a holiday appearance
than one of business. Of the more
prominent of those who attended the
opening:, few arc known to be among
the living now. Even many of the
records of the early days of the Cus- ;
tom-bouse are missing, thus making it
impossible to correctly chronicle the.
history of the building up to the six
ties, when J.;W. Probasco, the veteran
Kau#<er of the service, entered the em
ploy of: the Government and was. later
followed by Brokers Doden' end . Mat
toon, who were among the appointed
inspectors.
Collector Hammond relinquished his of-,
fice In September, IfCS, to Milton ;S. La
tham, who, two years later, was succeeded
by.B. F. Washington. It was not until the
conclusion of the latter's term that a
Republican. was appointed to : the office of
Collector of thi* port, the Democrats,. by ,
virtue of their, power in Xvashington, hav
ing enjoyed the local patronage of , the
Federal departments \ip to that time. On
June 1. ISGI. President Lincoln appointed'
Ira P. Rankin, a respected . citizen _of
Sjm Francisco, to the position of Collec
tor, and his selection was signalized by a :
general upheaval in Custom-house. .'
Democrats were superseded by Repub
licans, who were known to be loyal, to
the Union. Rankin entered office In a pe
riod of exciting events, when the influ
ence of those in sympathy" with - the
Southern Confederacy was being exerted
in an effort to place California in the list
of rebellious States. In those trying days
the' officials -of the Custom-house were
kept constantly- on the gui yive.. : Rumors

advocates of secession, and it required

cials to insure the confiscation of these
contraband arms. . ; M , \u0084
The close of the war came as a great
relief to the customs officers, except : Col
lector Rankin,* who, through a seandai in
the draylng department, with which onÂ©
of his, relatives was connected, was. sub
jected to a great deal of 'humiliating com
ment. Collector Rankin was succeeded by
F. . F, Low on June 1. 18C1 The latter,
however, had higher political aspirations
and resigned the same year to enter' the
gubernatorial" contest, in which he was '
victorious over the Democratic candidate,
John G. Downej-. W. B. Farwell, the Na
val Officer, was temporarily Installed as
Collector -of Port until Charles James en
tered upon those duties in October, 1863.
James' successors were John F. Miller,
Timothy Guy Phelps, Thomas B. Shah
non. B. L. Sullivan, W. H. Sears, John :
S. Hager, John H. Wise, John P. Jackson
and Stanley Jackson, who temporarily
filled the posltlon'after his father's death,
until the appointment of the incumbent,
F. S. Stratum. . . ( .
Of all these men, excepting, of course.
Collector Stratton, the only 'survivor Is
John H. Wise, who, with the late Judge
Hager. was favored with the appointment
by President Cleveland. Timothy Guy
Phelps served two terms as Collector of
Port, and lived to regret that he ever, ac
cepted the appointment, for the second
time. His last term was fraught with
many scandals in the department, of
which he had no connection : other than
having had his confidence abused in se-_
lecting men for positions under him. A
great Fcandal was " unearthed in the Ap
praiser's department that resulted in dis
cioÂ«-'inÂ»s t*at r Â«*rced the retirement of
Appraiser C. M. Levl and later of Sur-,
veyor of the Port/D. M. Cashin.
Aside from these affairs the history of
the old Custom-house . was marked with
â¢ comparatively few scandals. Occasional
ly a clerk would be detected in petty pec
ulations, but his return of the money he
had misappropriated and his resignation
closed the incident so far as the Govern
ment was concerned. In many cases the
charitable disnosition of , ,iÂ£. \ B. Jerome,
-who was for years, the. recognized facto
tum of the customs department, saved :
the guilty employe ; from public expos
ure. Jerome probably knew more about
tho affairs of the. Collector's office than
many of the Collectors. themselves, a fact
that is supposed to have kept him at
tached to the: department, through the.
different political administrations. .He t}_
was appointed by Collector Miller, who
afterward went to the United States Sen
ate. â¢He served as special deputy .col
lector up to the time that John P. Jack
son assumed the, office of " Collector. In
the capacity of special deputy the duties
of Collcrtor of Port often devolved upon
Jeromo during the* temporary . absence of
hl3 superior. He was practically the ad
viser of a number of the Collectors and
the wisdom 'he displayed in his -decisions
in matters of importance pertaining,, to
the office were . frequently highly ! com
mended by ihfe officials at Washington.
, Few. men in the Federal - service have
enjoyed greater respect or made more
friends than did Deputy. Collector Jerome

tom-house /His death; a few years ago

condition appealed to the sympathy of
his old associates ln : the building and
on the" eve of his retirement they
raised a purse of $1 500 for him. Later
he secured another and ' more modest
Government position, but his money
went Just, as fast as when he was
drawings a more lucrative salary, and
he finally died penniless; He was re
membered, however, as a man who had
possessed many high qualities, among
them his uncompromising loyalty for,
the Union during the rebellious times.
He was always a steadfast- Republi
can and as such he served in the legis
lative halls of California as Senator
and Assemblyman, and also as Dele

Collector John F. Miller's adminis
tration in the Custom-house, from 1565
to' 1870, when he declined a renora
inatloh, w*.s known to the employes
of the: service as the earthquake pe
riod, for It was in October, 1868, that
a great quake disturbed San Fran
cisco. A number of the more promi
nent buildings, among them the then^
comparatively new Custom-house,,
were badly damaged by the shock and
several persons were seriously In
jured ior i. killed by falling walls. . The
earthquake occurred shortly before
8 o'clock In the morning, 'an hour be
fore it was ttie.'custom to open - the
doors of the building "for 'the day's
business. - -The - watchman .had Just
emerged . from â¢ the building when the
shock I occurred and undoubtedly es-
caped 1 death,-, for a few seconds . later
a Â£ large", portion \ of 'the . handsomely
stuccoed wall : of ,\u25a0 the main ' ofllce ; of the
Custom- house fell with a terrific crash
to the floor as the pillars of the por
tico on the Battery-street side creaked
and cracked in the midst of the terri
ble shaking. . â¢ â¢" ;
Later in the day a survey of the
building by the Government officials
the fact that several of its
walla had been opened by the shock
and large sections of the brown "mas
tic with which they had been covered
on the outside had dropped off. At
that time the floors of the building 1
were covered with brick flagging, the
weight of which had weakened . the
crossbeams and caused the flooring on
the third floor to fall to the rooms be
low. .
As a result of the survey it was de
cided that the building would have
to be rebraced before it could be used
again and It was consequently aban
doned for a time until this work could
be accomplished.*
It was also decided to remove the
â¢ portico : from the entrance, owing, to
the weakened condition of its supports,
w-hicfry-explaliiedfrthe peculiar- appear
ance of the Battery-street entrance la
later years. Even to the day the build
ing -was finally abandoned, two weeks
ago, several big openings In the west
wall under the roof, caused by that
eventful earthquake, were plainly dis
cernible. In fact, in \one of them,
pigeons . and their broods had long
found a shelter. For years the pigeons
were the particular pets of "Pop" Flint
of the naval office, who al&o had a kind
regard for the Custom-house cat.
which, with its kittens, has refused to
leave the old building, despite til*
threatening danger from fallen bricks
and other debris.
Although the chroniclers of the early
incidents In San Francisco have usually
referred to the files of the old . papers v ~
.for. their .data; much of the latter
could just as well have been secured
from the records of the -old Custom
house, , for among the> latter are found
the reports of the city's commercial ad
vancement; notes bearing on tha many
.exciting affairs of the day, such as tha
frequent fUiDuster expeditions. . In thÂ«
suppression of which the customs of
ficers took a prominent part; refer
ences to the outbreaks of the ruffianly
element: of the disastrous fires and
earthquakes, and of that . Important
question, Chinese Immigration, which .
is still agitating the people of the city.
According to the records of the Cus
. tom-hbuse. Chinese were among tha
earliest settlers in San Francisco. In
1843 more than 300 Mongolians arrived
In. port and the following years the lo
cal Chinese population was augmented
by the arrival of. 425. At,- first they
were treated with considerable cour
tesy, but it soon dawned on the '.whit*
residents that the Chinese influx was
menacing to their Interests and the
agitation against them began and for
several years It was a subject of gen
eral discussion. â¢ ..
In later years, after the construction
of the Custom-house at Washington
- and Battery streets, Chinese Immigra
tion and the frauds that attended it
demanded more attention from the cus
toms officials than any other business
â¢connected with the department. The
Chinese restriction act resulted In the^
creation of the Chinese Bureau ,tn the â¢*
.Custom-house. and the latter was theâ¢
source of 30 per cent of the scnndals in
the â¢service^gÂ£@9fiQQÃ3PcSHÃSÃSH
Although properly under the control
of the Collector of the Port und of
ficially designated and for many years
referred to as the f Custom-house, the
"building now^-' being; removed had of
.late years been commonly spoken of as
\u25a0 the \u25a0 Pestofnce building, which is easily
attributed to the fact that the-"Post
office occupied the entire lower floor of
the building for many years and was
more' generally patronized than the
customs department. . As the . customs
business grew so did that^of the Post
office. Years ago the inadequacy of the
accommodations in the ,; building â for
postal '.'', facilities \u25a0' became so apparent
that the Washington officials found It
necessary to make additions to the old
structure until - the original outlines of
the Custom-rhouse were almost obliter
ated from public view. While the en
trance of the .Custom-house, remained
on Battery . street, the fact "that the
main entrance to. the Poaofflce'waa on
Washington; street ~ caused many to
suppose that the frorftof the building
really faced .the latter . street. To the
I brokers .old attaches "of the Cus
tom-house, however, there was only
one entrance to the building. They re
garded it as : a violation of .traditions
'to enter. the building. by any other en
trance" than 'the one on Battery street,
arid^ when they ; assembled. for the last
time tin the 'olds structure two' weeks

{\u25a0'I >f HE little man in motley, thrusting
I his face through the curtains of
I the big circus tent, looked out on
I the gathering crowds and grinned.
To him that assemblage of gaping
backwoods pioneers was a greater show
than the one he was traveling with, al
though the circus itself was a pioneer in
its way. It was the first that had ever
traveled through the almost unbroken
forests of Southern Indiana, and the fame
of its performance at Vincennes had
spread to Ohio long before the plodding
oxen had drawn the heavy lion cages half
that distance.
Standing on a barrel, behind a hole In
the canvas of the tent, the little clown,
amused himself by watching the stream
of arrivals. As far as he could see, down
the glaringly sunny road, rising clouds of
dust betokened the approach of a seem
ingly endless procession. The whole coun
ty appeared to be flocking to the commons
just outside of Burnville, where the an
nual training in military tactics took
place on "muster days." People were
coming by the wagon load; nearly every
horee carried double, and one old nag
ambled up with a row of boys astride
her patient back from neck to tail.
It was a hot afternoon in August, and
a rank, almost overpowering odor of dog
fennel rose from the dusty weeds tram
pled down around the tent. The little
clown was half stifled by ~ie duit, the
heat and the smell, and the perspiration
trickled down his grotesquely painted
face: but an occasional impatient flapping
of his handkerchief to clear away the
oust of a new arrival was all that be
trayed his discomfort. He was absorbed
In the conversation of a little group who,
seated on a log directly under his peep
hole In the canvas, were patiently wait
4rtg: for the "performance to "begin. '
"My motley can't hold a candle to
theirs," he thought, with an amused
chuckle, as he surveyed them critically.
"Judgring by the cut of that girl's old silk
dress, it was a part of her grandmother's
wedding finery, and she probably spun the
stuff for that sunbonnet herself. But the
manâ Moses in the bulrushes! People
back East wouldn't believe me if I told
them how he is togged out; tow trousers,
broadcloth coat with brass â¢ buttons, bare
feet, and a coonskin cap, on this the hot
test of all the hot dog days ever created!'*
"I reckon the. elyfunt will be the big
gest sight," drawled the man. "That's
what drawed me here. I ain't never seen
even the picter of an elyfunt, and they
say this is the .real live article from
t'other side of the world. They say it kin
eat a cock of hay six foot high at one
meal." . _ . .
Here the baby stirred and fretted in the
woman's arms, and she wearily lifted it
to an easier position against her shoulder.
"1 wish Jim would hurry up," she sighed,
wiping her hot face on a corner of her
homespun apron.
"He's over yander belpin' ole Mis* Pot
ter put up her ginger-bread stand," an
swered the girl, pointing to a large oak
tree on the edge of the common. "I seen
'em when she first come a-drivln' up on
that big ox sled, with a barrel of elder
behind her. Law, I reckon she hain't
never missed , bein' on hand to sell her
calces and cider here on muster days nary
a time in ten years."
. " 'Taint Mis' Potter," answered the
older woman. "She's ben laid up with
rheumatiz nearly all summer. It's Boone
Ratcllffe's mother and his little Wil
liam."
"You don't mean it,". exclaimed the girl
with eager Interest, standing up to get a
better view. "Not ole 'Madame Ratcllffe/
as pap calls her! I've ben honin' for a
eight of her ever sense last spring, when
I heerd she'd come out from Maryland.
I used to hear about her afore Boone
married M'randy. It was M'randy as
told me about her. She said the ole lady
was so rich and so stuck up that she
never even tied her own shoes. They had
slaves and land and money and every
thing that heart could wish, and they
didn't think that M'randy was good
enough for their only son. The letters
they writ to Boone trying to head him off
made M'randy so mad that I didn't sup
pose she'd ever git over it."
"She diir.'t," answered the little wo
man, "and it was scant welcome they got
when they come. The letter they sent a
month aforehand never got here* so of
course nobody knowed they was a-ccmln',
and they want nobody down to the Ohio
River landin' to meet 'cm, My Jim he
happened to be thar when they got off *n
the flatboat. They was dreadful put out
when they "didn't find Boone watchin* out
for 'em, arter comin* all the way from
Maryland. Goodness knows what *ud be
come of 'em ef ' ' Jim hadn't- happened
acrott ,'em. The boat had gone on down
the river and left 'em -settin' thar on
shore amongst the bales and boxes, as
helpless as two kittens. Jim he seen 'em
a-settin' thar. and bein' a soft-hearted
chap, knowin' suthin was wrong," he up
acd sooke.
â¢'They was co bewildered like, 'count of
not finding Boone and - everything being
so difrunt from what they, had lotted on,
that they was well-nigh daft. ; The ole
mcv had ben sick ever sence they left
Pittsburg. and they was both plum tuck
ered out with that long flatboat trip. Jim
he jest h'isted 'em into the wagon, 'big
chest and all, and brought 'cm* on to
Burnville.
"He said 'twas plain to be seen they
hadn't never been used to roughin* It in
any way. The ole gentleman was so sick
he had to lean his head on. her shoulder
all the way, and she kep' a-strokin' his
white hair with her fine soft fingers, and
talkin' to him as if he'd ben a child. She
tried to chirk him up by tellin* him
they'd soon be to Boone's home, and talk
in' 'bout when Boone was a little feller,
tell Jim couldn't hardly stand It, he's that
soft-hearted.
"Ht knew all the time what a disap
p'intment was in store when they should
set eyes on M'randy and the cabin, and'
find Boone growed to be so rough and
common. It was dark when they got
thar. Boone hadn't got home yit, and
thar want a sign of a light about the
place. So Jim lef the ole folks setting
In the wagon and went in to break the
news to M'randy, knowin* what a high
tempered piece she is at times; He said
she was settin' on the doorstep in her
bare feet and dirty ole linsey-woolsey
dress, jawin* little William. :. She'd been
a-makln' soap* all day, and" was dead
tired. *
"When Jim tole her what -'twas, the
surprise seemed to'strlke her all of a heap.
She never made a move to git up, and as
soon as she could git her breath she be
gun to splutter like blue blazes. She said
some folks had more burdens laid onto
their shoulders than by rights was their
share, and she couldn't see what made
them ole people come trackln' out where
they was neither wanted nor expected.
She hadn't no airthly use. for that stuck
up ole Mis' Ratcliffe, if she was Boone's
mother. Oh, she jest talked up scan'lous.
"M'randy didn't even offer to shake
hands. After she'd stared a minute she
said, sorter stiff like, 'Well, I s'pose you
may as well come on In.' Jim says there
was tears in the ole lady's eyes when she
follered M'randy into the cabin, but she
wiped 'em away real quick, and spoke up
cheerful to ole Mr. Ratcliffe.
"Ole Mis' Ratcliffe tried to apologize
fer comin'. She saldHhat their daughter
back in Maryland tried to keep 'em from
it, but that Boone couldn't come to them,
and It had been ten years since he had
left home, and they felt they must see
h*ji once more before they died. Jim said
it was so pitiful the way she talked that
he got all worked up."
"Why, didn't they turn right around and
go home the next day?" cried the girl,
with flashing eyes. "That's M'randy all
over again when she once gits her temper
up, but people as rich as them don't have
to put up with nobody's high 'and mighty
ways."
"They are not rjch any more," was
the answer. "A few years -ago they
lost all they had, slaves, land and
everything, arid their married daughter
in Baltimore is takin' care of 'em. She
was sure they wouldn't find it agree
able out here, so she provided the
money for' em to come back on; but
the ole man had - his pockets I picked
comin' down on that flatboat, an.they. they
don't feel as they could write back and
ask her for more.' She's good to^ 'em
as can be, but she hasn't got anymore
than she needs, and they hate to ask
for It. That's why the ole lady is here
to-day, takln* Mis' Potter's place. Boone
persuaded her to come and" tole; her If
she could make as much as Mis' Potter
always does it will be enough to - pay,
their -way back to Maryland. He. helped
her get ready. I don't know what he
said to M'randy to make her stand aside
and not Interfere, but she made up the
ginger bread as meek as Moses "and let!
Jim roll the, barrel^of cider out'of the'
smokehouse without a' word.',' |
"Why don't Boone scratch around arid*'
raise the money somehow?": put in, the' \
man, who had chewed, .in ' Interested
silence as he listened to the story. Now
he stopped to bite; another mouthful
from his big. twist "of tobacco be^ took'
from his broadcloth coat pocket.'
" ; "'Pears like their only. son is the one;
that ought to do fer 'emj and at least he;;
could 'make M'randy shut up and treaty
his parents civil." ; "- :J.
"Boorie!"- sniffed, the woman. "Why,'
he's under .- M' randy's thumb ' so tight
that he â¢ dasserit sneeze if [she don't take ;
snuff.' Besides,- he's/been on 'the flat qf }
his' back- off and 'on 'all summer with:
dumb ague. It's' run into a slow fever,
'now/ and It takes every 'picayune ', they <
can scrape together Ub- git /his /medl-'
clnes.:; Then,- too, M'randy sprained her;

have* been^awful sense then. ;* The . old:;
man'he^don't realize : he^is in the/wayy "
he's "so" childish arid broken "'down.*/ He/
jest "sorter droops around,, plnin* for ; the*
comforts he's alvyays ben used \u25a0 to, in a
\u25a0way .that almost breaks his ole wife's
heart. She -feels it keen enough; for
both of 'em, because she can't bear to
see him lackin' anything he needs, and
she'd rather die than be a" burden to
anybody. , ,
"I'll tell Jim I'm sorry for the whole
set, and. I 'can see It isn't the pleasantest
thing for ; M'randy; to give up a room to
them 'when thar's; only two In the cabin,
and her waysain't, their ways," and, their
bein' thar.puts everything out 'of joint;
but Jim he sides with "the ole people.
He's mighty : sorry, for 'em,' andLwould
have pu t his hand in his own" pocket < and
paid .'. their- expenses long ago 'back: to

- a great, comfort to the ole lady, > he's jest
that soft hearted. ?I ' hope -she'll 'sell \u25a0 out
as fast as Mis- Potter always, done."
Before. the' girl could echo her wish there

The crowds'frightened him, and he stayed
as closely as a shadow at his grandmoth
er's elbow, until the music began. Then he
forgot, himself. It thrilled him indescrib
ably, and he watched with longing eyes
as the people crowded into the tent. It
seemed to him that he must certainly go
wild if. he. could not follow, but' they had
sold nothing. Even if ,they had, he would
not have oared to ask. for enough; money
to pay. his admission, it seemed such lan
.enormous, sum.;. As she began to nod in
her '.chair,: he began '-. to edge . nearer the
tent. ;â¢Â» He could catch now : arid then a
| word' of the clown's Jo^es â¢ and hear the
"roars of laughter that fallowed. -
, Regardless of consequences, he - threw
himself on the grass and wriggled around
until -he succeeded '. in squeezing himself
under the canvas. There was a moment
jof dizzy \u25a0be wilderment as he sat up and
looked around. Then some cold, squirm
â¢ ing ; thing , touched . the i back of his neck.
He gave a smothered cry of terror; it was
the I elephant's /trunk. ; He had come â¢, up
directly under : the animal ."from t'other
side of the world that . could eat a ! six
-foot cock, of hay at. one ; m^al."
.As he sat there, shivering and blubber
ing,- afraid to -move because ihe ;dld not

guffaw. .The pock-marked Irishman who

and ; slapped ' his - thigh : and laughed . again

t gravely wiped his eyes and drew the boy
out from under, the great animal. William
clung to him, sobbing. .Then the warm

him all the ; sights. H ln the" delight of that

"to ? Whom - the .' bewildered ? little William :
stilf clung, had undertaken to find "tha
boy's grandmother for him. The child*
artless story had aroused his warmest
sympathies, and nothing could have given
him greater pleasure than this oppor
tunity to fight for her.
The Irishman looked embarrassed as
Mrs.* Ratcliffe began to thank him with
. tears in her eyes, and hurried back to the
tent. The look of distress deepened on
her face. \u25a0 Everybody passed her table
for the one made popular by the loud
'voiced man, who knew so well how to ad
vertise his wares. "With a stifled groan
she looked around on the great pile of
provisions she had brought. What quan
tities of good material utterly wasted!
What would Miranda say?
As she looked around her in dismay she
saw the clown coming toward her, still in
his cap and bells. He had been watching
the, scene from a distance. Her distress
.was pitiful. To bo compelled to wait on
this jesting fool like any common bar
maid would fill her cup of degradation to
overflowing. What could she do if he ac
costed her familiarly, as he did every one
else?.
He leaned. over and took off his gro
tesque cap. "Madam." he said. In a
low, respectful tone, "I have no money,
but if you will kindly give me a cake
. and a mug- ot cider you shall soon have
plenty of customers."
Greatly surprised she filled him a
cup, wondering "what he would do.
.There was a. rush for that part of the
grounds as the hero of the hour ap
peared. He had been funny enough In -
the ring, but now they found his Jokes
irresistible. His .exaggerated praises of
all he ate and drank were laughed atÂ» v
'but everybody followed h!3 example.
'More than one gawky boy bought
something for the sake of being made
the subject of his flattering witticisms.
The tavern keeper called and sang in
vain. As long: as the clown told funny
stories and praised Mrs. Ratcllffe'a
gingerbread all other allurements were
powerless. He stayed with her, until
the last cake had been bought and the
cider barrel was empty. .
It was nearly sundown when she
started home. Jim came up to roll tha
empty barrel on to the sled, to place
her chair against it, and help little
William -hitch up the oxen; but when
she looked around to thank the little
clown -he had disappeared. No one
could tell where he had gone.
Never in her girlhood, rolling: home
in the stately family coach from some
-gay social conquest, had she felt so vic
torious. She Jingled the silk reticule
at her side with childish pleasure.' She.
could hardly wait for the slow oxen to
plod* the two lons miles toward home,
and when they stopped In front of the
little cabin she was trembling: with
eagerness. Hurrying up the path
through the gathering dusk, she poured
her treasure out on her husband's bed.
"Look!", she . cried, laying her face
on the pillow and slipping an arm
around his neck. "We are going back
to Maryland, dear Â» heart!" She nestled
her faded cheek against his with a
happy little sob. "Oh, William, w>
need not be a. burden any longer, fo*
we're going home to-morrow!" "'\u25a0 '.
. Later, the full August moon swung
up over the edge of the forest. It
flooded the .little clearing . with Its
white light, and turned the dusty road
in front of the cabin to a broad band
of silver. A slow, steady tramp, of . \u25a0
many, feet marching across* a wooden
bridge In the distance fell on the in
tense stillness jof the summer night.
"It's the circus," said Boone, raisins;
his head to listen. "I reckon they're
travelln" Jby night .on account of tha
heat, and they'll be pushing down tot
â¢the river."
His wife limped to, the door and ia.t
down on the step to watch for .Its com- I
ing. but his mother hurried out to the -
fence and leaned across the bars," wait*

Â« w HS. JOHN* JACOB ASTOR
f\ A walked up Fifth avenue the
( V j otlier day looking In the shop
>â¢ ] windows. She wore a gown of
* orchid colored cloth trimmed
with eradiated -bands of embroidery of
the same color. There were five wide
baiids en the skirt and two en the waist,
and these bands were embroidered in a
tiny Oaisy pattern. Around her waisi
there was a girdle of orchid colored kid
fastened with a gold clasp, while her
rloycs and hat were also in orchid. The
hat Lad two bunches of violets, while a
violet veil was draped over it. Around
her neck there was aa Ascot tie of white
fur. and she carried a white pillow muff.
As this leader of fashion strolled up
Fifth avt-nue. siancir.g 1 in the shop win
dows, she saw many things to catch the
eye, for the season is now fully on. and
tht- store windows are crowded with in
teresting articles. There is no finer dis
play In the world than that which Is now
en view in the shop windows, and women
who appreciate these opportunities will
not ceglect tha chance to get out and
look ar what is to be seen.
In o::c of the windows there was a dis
play of handsome fall dresses, which
were fitted upon beaudful models, and
these dresses were finished and set forth
in a way to catch tbe eye and to capti
vate the taste of any woman-^ven the
tcost fastidious.
It was a visiting foreigner who ex
claimtc upon the beauty of the draped
figures in the shop windows. "You can
s*e yourself as others see you," said she.
locking at a lovely brunette wax figure,
which ctood in a front window. "In
London we don't attempt to make such
a display, and in Paris there is no such
thing as a truly elegant shop window, but
here you show the styles to beautiful
advantage. It Is indeed a treat to walk
through your principal thoroughfares."
Urfji Rich TallerOXade Hon.
Among the tailor-made gowns in the
Eboj> windows there was one of very heavy
winter mohair. It looked like an imported
variety, though it was really of domestic
make. It was deep In color and extremely
th:tk for mohair. Woven in the dark or
chid background there were tiny coral
colored figures and. here and there, there
was a heavy stripe, which looked like a
satia stripe.
The gfcirt would have been perfectly
pa In had it not have been for a band
of heavy ejiK which was placed around
the bottom. Then there were a few silk
figures applied with handsome stitches.
The jacket was a. bolero jacket slit on
the shoulders to allow a puff sleeve. The
front was cut round, suggesting a shoul
der cape, while the coral colored lapels
turned back from the throat and were
caught upon the bust with a big, hand
some silk bow. It was a charming suit
and one which might have been selected
by any woman of good taste for a winter
suit.
It is very dimcult to understand how
any woman can fail to be suited these
days, for tfce sht p windows are so very
attractive. They show not only expen
sive goods, but medium grades as well,
and one can come down to a dress which
is really cheap. Thus one can get a
gown which cost SlOO and upward, or a
ccraper one at one-tenth the price.
In cne window there was a really hand
foinc dress of dark red merino. Its only
trimming was a wide b_nd of merino
graduated and set around the skirt just
about on a line with the knees. Upon
this band there was the least bit of hand
embroidery. The waist was a simple
ehlrt waist and then there was a little
loose jacket of merino, with a little em
broidery upon it; it was cut off at the
hips and finished something like an Eton.
This dress, though elegant in appearance,
could easily have been copied for $10.

In another show window there was quite
a display of the handsome brocades

ON BEATING THE GAME
Fable for the FbolisK
Â«â y VERT man has his own way of
/ beating the game, but only one
"7 t out of a thousand of the different
Jwi methods will succeed. Some be-
Ueve mr playing the waiting game,
and some go In with a rush in the be
lief that they can win out before the
other fellows find out that there Is any
thing doing. Some wait to see how the
crowd 3s going and then fall in with the
procession, and other* Â»Â«t cat ahead In
the belief that tbe band will follow the
first man who sets the pace. Still others
v/ntcb the crowd and then travel in the
other direction in the hope that they may
attract attention by playing a lone hand.
Of the list it may be said that they are
usually called cranks while they are alive
end herccs after they are dead. They
have monuments built to them and col
leges named after themâ when it is too
late to make them feel good.
Having laid out the ground plan of our
little serxnonette, we shall proceed to the
construction of the superstructure. Once
upon a time there were two men. This
la not to cay that there were not other
men more or less in existence at the came
time, but for the purposes of our present
discourse we can afford to neglect the
rest of the inhabitants of the earth's
surface. One of them we shall call Al
fred and the other John. John is a useful
kind of a name because it doesn't reveal
ony thing. Any man with that kind of a
cognomen attached to his person might
be either a saint or a bank president.
Alfred is not so useful. Tou would al
most yager a weeks-p ay that "a man
lndissolubly. wedfled to such , a name
would part - his hair , in the middle and
xrcar straight collars frith a pearl scarf
pin.
The early years of these gentlemen
\u25a0were very similar In many respects. 'They
\u25a0were both born of parents who werÂ« poor
shades of violet, orchid and other tones
A very lovely brocaded dress wis in two
shades of green, and Its pattern was
that of a princess fitted around the
waist and across -the shoulders. There
was no trimming except a few. bands ol
narrow green and white embroidery. upon
the waist and around the sleeves. This,
too, while very elegant in appearance,
could have been copied for something like
$20, providing one did not pay' too. much
for the brocade. ;. *.
It Is a merciful thing this season that
materials come at all prices. You can
really select anything you want for about
your own price. Silks come â¢as low as
40 cents, and from that price you can go
on up almost to any sum. "At a medium
figure you can get something. very hand
some, and the woman who wants to pay
only 51 can select a pattern which will
suit her admirably. She needs only a
little taste in making: it. up and a* little
forethought in selecting -the color. .
In nearly .all the shop windows one sees
an attempt to jnake the hat correspond j
with the dress.* The hat becomes a part
of your costume, and where you are
wearing an orchid gown you will wear
an orchid hat also. This, in these days
of cheap hats, is not an expensive thing
to accomplish. -while it adds very much.
to the general appearance. Be all dress
ed alike If you can.
One of the most charming suits of the
year was made of green cashmere, cut In
princess shape, with a half train and a
very snug waist. This princess, which ex
tended but to the belt line; was com
pleted with a little bolero coat which was
and therefore of unassailable honesty. .It>
is a mistake to assume that honesty ,*is)
a. rare virtue with the poor. It's the only"
article they can possess which doesn't!
cost them anything. The man' who has j
money in the bank Is a thief ipso facto. <
If he isn't, how does he happen to have!
so much money? He must have stolen '
It. But to return to Alfred' and John:!
They passed through â¢ the . came joyous ]
round of mumps, | measles, whooping '
cough, and other pastimes of. care-free!
childhood. They both occupied several]
years in avoiding an education at the
little red schoolhousc on the hill, and they
made their debut in the frigid world at"
about the same time. . J
Their * beginnings > were very . modest, \
both being engaged in tfae time-hallowed;
task of building the fires, sweeping? out !
the office and running errands -for C 50 a]
week. But there was a radical difference)
in the manner in which they set out for]
the conquest of fame and f ortune. : . Al- J
fred had read the moth-eaten fable about*
the hare and the \u25a0 tortoise and believed j
it all. It is ; hard to â¢understand, in 'this <
skeptical age how any man could im-i
agine that a "common or garden- mud- j
turtle with barna*les on- his * back could <
bea^t a thoroughbred hare to the wire, J
but Alfred was of; the opinion that: it J
must be true because he saw it - in print. <
Nowadays people are more apt ' to con- !
elude that'the printed word -is concocted;
for the express purpose of '\u25a0* concealing !
the truth, but Alfred , had not ' reached ]
that stage, of development.*. '-He _ thought 1
that air he had to *do . wasX to go? slow !
and make sure that he had both feet .

\u25a0 In' one of the shop windows there was
displayed an Imported gown whlfch was
marked at . an ; exceedingly hJÂ§rh figure,
though It could have been duplicated for
a very moderate sum. It was made of the
fashionable "'"orchid color, cloth and the
texture -was \u25a0 that of a ', fine -broadcloth.
It was cut In' the very popular princess
shAp* r tight fitting around the waist, and
fliring full â¢> toward . the floor. The up"per
p&rt -was 'a jacket shape - with elbow
sleeves and wide , lapels. The principal
feature of 'this "dress was : its , embroid
ery.' All over the cloak there are cut
eyelet holÂ«s and these were -embroidered
in orchid Colored J silk, so that the entire
suit.' was. a-vision In English eyelet em
broidery.
Embroidering your winter, suit is quite
a pastime with : the woman who has a
iew .. minutes > a day on ; her hands. The
work Is very simple, for It requires noth
ing ! more - than the \ ordinary amount of
needle craft, but' It must* be done , neatly
'and with patience. If ;one is willing to
spend the i time one. can V obtain a dresa
which. is every whit as beautiful as the
most fashionable Paris gown of the sea
pon. One example of this .will suffice.
- A . very handsome black broadcloth was
stamped with -a conventional daisy pat
tern. The petals of .the 'daisy were cut

This made the English eyelet embroidery
effect, which was carried out all over the
whole gown. It was, as can be seen,
rattier a trying thing to. perform, but by
no means an expensive one. You can do
so much with your needle this year.
It la winter and *- one cannot think of
winter garments without thinking of win
ter / furs. The . feminine mind wanders
toward _furs at this season, and the wom
an of. good taste will scarcely consider
herself dressed unless she Is wearing a
handsome fur set She will want, if pos
sible.'a nJce. ; fur coat, and, if she cannot
obtain this, '. she â¢ will need a nice collar

have a very fine fur, toque. ;. With, thi3 fur
set she is complete. ' But oh, dear, how
furs do cost!

Some years ago there was an agitation
led- by -the -wife of the President of the
United States upon the propriety of dress-
Ing on J5OO a year. Mrs. Roosevelt de-
clared that it couia be done and that she
herself - had for years ; dressed upon J25
a;* month: > .; . >:\ . - \u25a0.â¢;,'-"V'"-.. ' -.

transpired 'that several prominent women
were actually "dressing upon SXjO 'a. year,
which- included ! dinner gowns, * reception
Nicholas Nemo
; cars started ; running. Being a good fel
low, he passed the tip on to Alfred, but
i that cautious individual opined that he
! wbuld_ prefer ito , wait ; until , the franchise
1 was granted. In vain *John " assured . him
â¢ that it would then be eternally too -late
1 for a young .- man . of restricted means , to
get into the game.,! Alfred .responded that
he bad always been told by hla respected
parent on bis father's side that the only
proper ."guide for a, young man was"' to
be â¢ sure ; that : he "' was light and then go
ahead. AH that John could say to that
was- â¢ that \u25a0 his " C limited experience had
taught^ him .that- the: man > who; always
waited to be right never went ahead.
Failing^ to arouse Alfred to the need of
the situation. John took the -flier and
landed \ with : both teei. : The street car
line was built as per tip and John picked
up - a ;; neat- little*, profit of â¢ about 300, per
cent, * while Alfred \u25a0 wept on h!s : own neck
because *he 7 hadn't -; foreseen what was

business, but business and matrimony are
near enough alike so ] that the same rules
will apply/ with entire jusMce and lappra^

male sex :' divine. : but' -'Alfred was ; afraid
that she > didn't truly,; love nlm, so he sat
around' and .waited -for her, to give him â¢an '

meanwhile John took the bit between his

:in the confusion "of the | moment admitted
that "She 'didn't know any one better quali

' thoughts : anent > Alfred,' - but that -\u25a0 young
toilettes, walkins costun3C3 and luiyraeon
dresses- The same a!so paid for ; aiiirt
waists, underwear and shoea.
In the general howi which swept-., over
the "country, a bÂ° wl of Indignation from
society women-who were attempting to
drrss on this sum. it came out that thera
were certain exceptions to the rule and
that these exceptions Avere not only very
prominent ones, but very important ones
as well. The romen who were dressing:
on 5330 a yearâ and who were including
a number of elegant dinner gowns and
fine clothes generally on this sumâ were
much assisted by the articles already
In their wardrobe; and these articles,
which included fura. lacÂ«s, old sllka and
jewels, figured very largely every year In
the makinc of the garments.
â¢si " have a doxei} handsome lace
flounces," said one society woman who
was Interviewed on the subject, "and I
also own a number of handsoma silk
dress lengths, which were Imported from
the Orient long ago: others were given
to me aa a wedding present. In addition
to these I have six handsome fur sets
and Quantities of narrow strips of fur
which I use for trimmings.
"I also own twelve dozen beautiful but
ton sets, which have been the collection
of our family for two generations; and. la
addition to these. I have such dress ac
cessories as ostrich tips, handsome arti
ficial flowers, beautiful jeweled trimmings,
lovely passementeries and /an endless
amount of handsome velvet and ribbon.
"With these I can manage to dress on I3OQ
a year."
Thus the $25 a month problem was
solved and It was understood how thÂ»
average society leader with her eXQUislta
supply of heirlooms could manage to
dress on a sum which was impossiblo for
the domestic woman who had no heir
looms.
Novelties la Flae Drew.
But the woman who Is trying to dress
cheaply can find herself very much as
sisted this season by the materials which
are spread upon the counters. They are
so very reasonable In price- and so very
beautiful In texture. There are lovely
narrow embroideries running from 12
cents up, which are just the thins for tha
trimming of plain shirt waists and for the
decoration of plain tailor-made gowns.
Upon the lace gowns there are lovely
lace. medallions, lace butterflies, lace tri
angles, lace strips and lace pieces of every
sort.-all of which can be utilized in tha
decoration of winter coat?, winter skirts, .
cashmere bodices and every other article
which a woman will wear. *
Lace is to be a great deal w.6rn upon
"winter gowns, and even on stree^ dresses
one sees it very much. In one of the sho;Â»
windows there Is a very handsome cloth
dress, trimmed around the neck anil
dowa." the front with a tan colored lace
jabot.- Set in the jabot of lace there is a
strip of black fur. The muff is made c'
black fur, with a trimming of white Saoe
along the upper part and at each end.
Bows of velvet are set in the lace.
Jn the novelties cne sees a beautiful
girdle ma<le of deep brown satin. Tbe
girdle is exceedingly wide to the back ar.-.l
very narrow in the front, where It la fas
tened with v. dull gold clujp. E.itenilinv;
ill the -way around it there 'is, a bandar.
3ark brow*ri lace, very heavy and Iooliln"? t
very much like a heavy torchon lace.' Tha
lace is applied to -the satin with Invisible
stitches, and along each edge there 19 v
border of hand embroidery.
The hit to, wear with the winter dress
ts certainly, a varied one. You can pick
your, own style yourself, for the big pic
ture hat is In town, as is also the Eng
lish walking hat, the felt sailor and the
neat little cloth toque. Perhaps looking
over all, the hats, ycu will decide m fa
vor of the little toque, in preference to "the
others,' and, when you have done so. you
will want to take a piece of your dress
goods for .the making of your toque, as
well as for the trimming.
One very. lovely little cloth hat was
made of brown cloth and trimmed with
bands of green. At one side there was a
long peacock \u25a0 colored quill caught to the
hat with a big bow of green velvet. Tbl<Â»
made an exceedingly beautiful hat. The
winter sailor, . trimmed with , a wing at
each side, and decorated with a biff sold
buckle at the middle of the front. Is a
fashionable hat. aa Is also the English
walking hat, trimmed with a lons plume
and caught with a buckle.
If you are wearing a set of ermine, and
it Is to be hoped that you have captured
a set of this very fashionable fur, yon can
utilize 'the boa In various ways/ One
very lovely sailor hat had an ermine boa
around the crown. At* tbe back it was
fastened with a beautiful buckle in such
a way that the ends hung down several
Inches;. Another hat was trimmed with
pieces of â¢ ermine put on at the side to
look like a handsome bow. Odds and ends
of fur are thus utilized In the trimming
of the winter hat*.

the point that she got tired of waiting

Here Is the tale of a dollar jusi
earned by a millionaire's 6on that
beats anything any self-made mil
lionaire can tell when he U holding him
Â«T* ' UP as a shining: example of success
T.'.-ozn* small beginnings.
There Isn't cne of our millionaire old
codgers-not Russell Sage, nor Andrew
Carnegie, nor John D. Rockefeller him
selfâwho, when he' gets up before a Sun
day school class of admiring, ambitious,
rosy-cheeked youths, or a large assem
blage of nice, clean, circumspect young
clerks, eager to emulate the distinguish
ed speaker, and gives them. the Infallible
recipe for getting riches by assiduous
Industry and economy, that can tell such
a tale of a hard-earned dollar as can
young David Hammond. '
And young David Hammond Isn't a
millionaireâ yet. He's only the son of a
millionaire.
John D. Rockefeller's famous firs/ dol
lar that he earnedâ the tale is a dasslo
nowâ in a general store by a month's
labor Cor was it three' months'?), and
soaked away so carefully as the nestegg
of his present competency, was "easy
money" compared with this .dollar that
young David Hammond, the millionaire's
son, earned, and that he has just received -
in cash.
Young David Hammond is David Ham
mond Jr., the son and namesake of David/
Hammond of Chicago, of the great pork
packing firm of G. H. Hammond Com-"
pany. which Is, perhaps, \he largest pork
packing firm and certainly the third larg
\u25a0^st packing house In Chicago â which
means In the world.
The story begins with young David
Hammond running away from home In
*'hicago â from his luxurious home at Â«8
Humboldt boulevard, on the fashionable
Northwest Side. his home where
i here is ease and comfort and
plenty, where there are servants to do his
bidding, and a loving mother to Inter
pose between him aod an irate father
who thinks that even millionaires' sons
should do something besides seek pleas
ureâas it Is to be found In Chicago.
He ran away from home last Marchâ
the last week in March of this year â when
he was not yet 20 years old, an Idle; pem
pered boy of 19; and it was because he
ran away from home that he earned this
dollar.
Perhaps if he had not run away he
would have never earned a dollar. Who
can tell? Some millionaires' sons never
do.
At any rate he ran away from homeâ
partly for the 'sake of adventure, partly
because he resented paternal discipline,
and partly because of the follies and In
discretions hie youth and Idleness and too
much pocket money led him into.
In addition to the luxurious home and
the good clothes bis father supplied him
with, he had a monthly allowance as big
as the weekly wages of many a man who
supports a family on his earnings â a lib
eral allowance for a. 19-year-old boy.
t" He cays a little grumblingly to me, no
ficabt regarding it from the point of view
of the millionaire* son, that:
"It wasn't much of an allowance for a
fellow in Chicsgo. Why. I used to spend
the whole of It "in one night there."
His father had old-fashioned notions,
for himâ the paternal plans that spirited
youngsters with plenty of money in
eight think particularly boresome.
He wanted him to go to school, and
then to the university, or failing in that
to go out to the stock yards and take a
berth in the G. H. Hammond Company
packing house and fit himself for the
business.
When his father grew too Insistent, and
the consequences of his follies loomed
too large upon his horizon, he ran away
from home; he "skipped out," as he puts
it-
He arrived In San Francisco on the 26th
of Marchâ with twenty-three dollars In
Lit pocket and the world before him.
Just two hours after he arrived at the
Ferry building and was loitering along
the water front, letting his youthful
fancy play around the ships at the docks
and yield itself to the lure of the sea, a'
man came driving by in a buggy.
"A big, rather decent-looking man,
,tVasant In manner," young David Ham
"Pfcond tÂ«l!s me. "He asked me to take a
drink and tben he asked me to take, a
ride with him and when I" got Into the
buggy he said: 'Say. young feller, do you
want a Job?' I said that I did, for I
was walking around trying to figure out
what I could do for myself.
"'Well,* he said. ;i can fix you. You
ree those ships out there? How*d yoii
like to so out on one of them?* -
"I eeld I'd like toâ and I thought I
would, for I'd never been on the ocean
at all. I've been to New York and I,
taw the harbor there, but I never wrf*h
out on the ocean. The man told mt
he could get me a Job on-^one o( the
ships at a 'good thing,' where I'd make
lots of money.- He told me that fellgws
had gone out on the same kind of a Job
and made all the tray f rom S5OO to $10,000.
It sounded kind of good to me; so I said
all right, that I'd like to have a euch â¢
a job. .
"Then he took me to a boarding-houseâ
a sailor bcarding-house. down on the
water front There were all sorts of men
thereâ every nationality, strange, 1 rough
men, telling stories about all parts" of
the world. It xras a queer Â«ort of a
placeâ and interesting, too/ but awfully
rough. I slept on a cot In a big room full
of ether people. The bedclothes were
dirty and the food wasâ Ugh! I'd never
been used to that kind of food. .We had
hash and Irish stewâ the Lord only knows
what it was made ofâ and something they
.called coffee, and big hunks of bread.
j_*'He kept me. at this -sailor : : boarding-
three days, he and other- men tell--
Ins: me sort of secretly what a good thing
I was going to make . out of my. job." He
never told me just; what It wasâ except*
that It was to go to sea.

"Th^n he took me to 1M Mission street
âI'd never been over there, or about
town at all except along the water front
and on what they call the Barbary, Coast,
but I remember this place because I: pu'
the address down in my diaryâ and' there.

â¢\u25a0CONFIDENT that the people
/ / of the Pacific Slope will ml
l /^ tcrest themselves in his dar-
M^ iÂ»Br undertakings and assist him
In carrying out his plans. Dr.
AntoSne Varicle. a well-known young
French explorer, has arrived in
San Francisco * with a view to
arranging for an expedition to the
north pole. If you have the good for
tune to listen to the doctor's proposed
trip and judge his interesting manners
you will readily realize that he is in
earnest and has abundant confidence in
the success of his adventure. He fig
ures that the pole can be reached in
less than two years' time and esti
mates that the expedition will cost in
the neighborhood of $150,000. part of
which has already been assured him
::i the Northwest.
The wiry little Frenchman, who
yearns for advt-nture in the Far.Nortn,
has been a g-uest at the Palace Hotel
for several days conferring with local
people, whom he hopes to interest in
his exploration project.
Dr. Varicle is by no means alone in
Hie proposed expedition to the Arctic.
On the contrary he has the support of
a number of prominent organizations
of the Northwest, including the Yukon
Polar Institute, which was formed for
the purpose of assisting him and which
lias among its members Governor W.
W. H. Mdnncs and other government
officials of the northern British terri
tory. He has also received assurance
of support from the Alaska Club of
Seattle and similar organizations of
Portland.
The project to make the Pacific Coast
the starting point of another polar ex
pedition was conceived by the young
doctor several years ago while in Daw
son, which he first visited in IS3S. Being
an adventurer by nature and deeply in
terested" In polar trips of various ex
plorers, be began tb carefully study the
ix-ople of the Northwest with the avowed
Intention of determining whether or not
the material was there for the forming
of a well equipped and experienced ex
pedition. He kept careful records of the
tests of endurance of many of the men
engaged in traveling over the trallless
and mountainous sections of that part
of the Western continent, in all kinds
of weather, until he finally convinced
himself that if a polar expedition was to
be undertaken its best chance of success
would be with men who had been well
tried In everyday hardships of the North
western country
"Affaln In Dawson last winter," said
the doctor, "we resumed our tests of men
under conditions as near identical with
tboee Urn are known to exist near the
north pole. We sent men out into the
rough and unbroken country on rush
trips and forced them to sleep in the
open ?nd foraee for food. Accompanied
by several of the sturdy members of the
mounted police, that were kindly fur
nished me. 1 made a trip through a new
country 4K) miles to the north of Daw
eon, returning in forty-five days and
averaging nineteen miles of travel each
daw
"The manner in which the mounted po
lice stand the trials they are subjected
10 In that cold and cheerless country
readily impressed me with the Idea that
if some of the explorers, who have suc
ceeded In petting so close to the north
pole, had been accompanied by men of
the type of these peace guardians, their
mission would have been accomplished."
Dr. Varlcle, reviewing the past failures
to reach the pole, remarked that none of
The exrÂ»editlons had been properly equip
ped with â¢â¢mushers." such as arc found
In the Northwest, men who. through
> cars of experience, have thoroughly ac
customed themselves to the rigors of
the freezing climate of the Arctic's six
months' night. Instead the explorers had
permitted, in many Instances, friends to
accompany them on the perilous trips.
These men had proved themselves Ignor
ant of the methods of traveling in the
ice bound country and suffered untold
hardships . from the very time they en
tered the freezing zone, by reason of the
fact that they were not acclimated to
the north.
Composing the party which Dr. Varlcle
hopes to lead to the north will be some
of th^ best "mushers*" known in the
Northwest Territory. Not a few of
tfaese noted northern frontiersmen have
already agreed to accompany the young
Frenchman, two in particular being Ell
Verreau, a celebrated runner, and Jules
Marion, who has been carrying mail over
tfce Eagle-Tanana route for a long time.
One of the purposes of the doctor's pres
ent vtelt to San Francisco is to talk with
a number of the owners of whalers with a
view of securing their assistance, which is
absolutely necessary in the success of his
proposed trip. It is part of Dr. Varicle's
plan to so north with his expedition,
through the Bering straits as far as Grant
l^and. where a base of supplies can be es
tablished, and the party can then await
a favorable chance to dash across the
ice to the pole.
"If my project carries it i 3 my inten
tion to have here in the month of ; July,
and if possible I will make my start next
year," said he with a show of confidence
that plainly suggested that he little fears
for the success of his preliminary plans.
"I would like to charter a whaler that is
operating between Herschel Island and
Grant Land, and I have been informed
that there are at least fourteen vessels
that ore accustomed to this trip and are
possessed of crews that are thoroughly
acquainted with the map of that section
of tho north. .'\u25a0-',
"My objective point on Grant Land is
the nearest possible portion of that land
to the eightieth degree of north latitude,
ana from there we would convey our pro
visions to the most northerly, point of
Grant Land, where our base of supplies
would be established. This point is about
TOO miles from the unexplored regions of
th* . north pole. If we could leave her*
in July and reach Grant Land without
unnecessary delay, our expedition ought'
to be In readiness to make the dash for
the pole some time in the following Janu
ary. In this way we would probably hayÂ»
to en Jure the hardships ofjonly one co!<;
ncrlhcrn winter, for, as I have already
stated.' the distance from our proposed
base of supplies on the most northerly
point of Grant I-.ind. to the region of the
pole is about 700 miles, and from the
pole to Franz Josef Land and which
would be our objective point, after leav
ing the pole. i*ie distance Is. about 600
miles."
When one of his visitors rather loudly
remarked that the . doctor , seemed - most
sanguine of the ultimate success of his
hurried trip across the ice plateau; bet ween
Grant Land and the pole, he quickly i<-.
I<!icd, as he nervously waved his arms
nnd pointed to the maps and other, docu
ments lying on the table before. hjm:
"And why should I not feel sanguin??
If I was not fully convinced that I can
achieve success In this undertaking I
would not have gone so far in my prepa
rations. I would not have- prepared these
maps you see before me. and would not
have. wasted so much time studying ths
question from books of authority and by
hard experiences in the north.*-*.
Hejs" firmly, of. the belief that the pole
Is on land of that a body of land is situ
ated near it. These conclusions he has
derived from the various authorities, that
have been the closest to the "great objec-
live point. of exploration. \u25a0 According ,to
these the ice In that locality is not reg
ular; in some places it' is smooth, while :
in others it is formed like hillocks.
"The reports of .'Nansen support me in
this theory," he continued, "for, if my
memory is correct, Nansen wrote that .
after Â£6 degrees, and ,14 "minutes ice in
great upheavals was encountered,;' such
as he had not come across since leaving
the supposed - coast line of Franz Josef
Lan<h In the. records ' of Captain Cajni,
who headed the D'Abruzzl expedition, the
statement is made that tracks of foxes'
were found at Bt> degrees, and were the
first sign of /any animal Hfe that had
been noticed after. Frank- Josef Land had
been left behind.''
"My plan, of exploration includes' an
expedition of twenty men, selected, as" Il'I 1 '
have already explained, from , the most
experienced and" 'physically' able' men In
the Northwest. ' Each" of -these' men .will
have a dog team of eleven dogs and- a
supply of provisions; sufficient..f or two
years. After reaching Grant ; Land and
having established our supply basis and
made every \u25a0-\u25a0..necessary ; arrangement" for
the trip across .the ice. we could bide
our time for the' most favorable" opportu- ..
nity. When we are 'ready; to- make the
dash our expedition will" be 1 divided, into
two parties,. .one bf which will act' as an
auxiliary to the, other. "After crossing the
ice plateau for about' 200, miles, we' would
select f rom. the two parties, the. best 110 of
the 220 dogs i ancP'place their teams in
charge of the" youngest ' and* still most
rugged members of the expedition, replen
ish the supplies *of the .newly selected
party and then send the .rejected men
and dogs back toGrant Land, which they
can explore-, -while' the- other party is
continuing its journey toward the-pole.
"We ought to] move ahead at the rate
of ten miles a day, which would bring us
to our destination,' if It is really ap
proachable, as T think, in at most 100
days. Should kind Providence favor our
expedition and permit us â¢to reach the
pole we would; remain there long enough
to carefully make observations and then
proceed on to some". inhabited part of
Fran?. Josef Land, where provisions are
always to be "had, and. by a circuitous
route eventually . reach the civilized
world.
"With the experienced men I hope to
take with me I would have little reason
to fear the cold of the extreme north.
Certainly not .while: we are in "quarters
on Grant Land, for 'the temperature there
is 20 degrees less cold than It is in the
Klondike. A.nd there is another point
that may interest the public, and that is
that the distance we contemplate travel
ing after we leave Grant Landâ from our
basis of supplies to Franz Josef Land, is
about the same as the distance between
Dawson and Xome. " When one remem
bers that hundreds of men, in the win
ters of 1899 and 1900, made the trip down
the Yukon, through one of the roughest
countries in the world, it is easy for me
to believe that a well equipped expedition
will fare almost as well on the trip I
have proposed as they would on a 1300
mile trip from Dawson to Nome over a
"country covered with snow and ice."
"And If your dash' toward the pole
should fail?" was asked, with no inten
tion of disturbing the doctor's noticeable
feeling of confidence-.' * '\u25a0-\u25a0\u25a0
"Well," snapped the young explorer, as
if to resent any .suggestion in the ques
tion, "we would dash back again to Grant
Land, where we would probably be able
to find a whaler if. our own vessel had
departed." â¢
It Is the financial' side of the polar ex
pedition that is at present interesting the
doctor. To secure a suitable vessel to
carry his* eipediljon to. the northern ex
tremity-; of Grants Land Js one :, of j*the
merest - items - of : the i financial I outlay for
his trip, .for; the> whalers generally go
north .* comparatively . empty and '. would
probably; carry .'.the .entire ', expedition '( to
the north fora moderate consideration. V."
.The , buying.-of * dogs < and , a two ' years'^
supply of provisions will, need the better
part of which -Dr. jVaricle es
timates": will bejthe 'cost Vof the trip. As
stated before he has been assured a por- ..' v
tion of this, from the enthusiastic peopl* s
of the Yukon Territory.iwho have: great
faith in his ability^ to â¢ carry, out the pro-;
ject, and f rom â¢ persons ; in Seattle and :;
Portland. He ' confidently "believes that
San Francisco; will contribute liberally
toward his : polar trip' after he has : put ; ::

Academy of \u25a0 Sciences and ; several j mdl- \u25a0
vlduals who", are; usually generous do
riators to projects that promise advance
ment of science". , ' ... : .. ,
"I have had volunteer .offers from more,.,
than one hundred men' who are eager *,
to accompany me on this: trip,!' said he, \u25a0â¢,
"and of this number I personally know '
at least forty, that would make fup s :a : ;.

Great care would \u25a0be taken in the selec- >
tion of the dogs for our sleds. ;I do

LAN MACLAREN
ALL, RIGHTS RESERVED.
ONE cf the ambiguities of English
speech Is the. verb "to marry." lor
it may mean either a clergyman
performing the marriage service
or a man marrying: his own wife,
and there is a pleasant story which
brings out the confusion of meanings. It
r *,% said that a learned and eminent theo
logian who was the head of a college
In one of the ancient universities, and a
bachelor of many years' standing, had
a young- friend to whom he had shown
much kindness, and who was much at
tached to him. One day ' she came to
him, and said she had a request to
make, and he must promise beforehand
to grant it.
"Well, my dear," the distinguished
person said, "you know I always do
anything you ask me. If It be in my
power I will do what you wish to-day."
"Then," oho said, "I wish you to marry
me," for she was breaking the news of
her love affair, as well as arranging the .
ceremony.
"To marry you!" exclaimed the vener
able head of the college in great con
sternation, "I want to please you. but I
can't do that. You know you are only
twenty and I am nearly seventy, and
don't you see. my dear, you would never
be happy." but what his friend wanted
was that the famous scholar should mar
ry her to another man. which he did
by and by with great satisfaction.
Professional Marriers.
Whether a minister of religion marries
in a personal sense, and some have
married in that sense several times, be
has to do a jrreat deal of marrylnf In
a professional sense, and some ministers
more than others. According to the di
rectory of the Scots Kirk people ought
to be married in church, but according
to the custom in modern times the vast
majority have been married in the house,
and the Scots law is so exceeding broad
â¢ that two people can be married any
where. The difficulty. Indeed, In Scot
land is not in getting married when you
are set upon it, but in being sure that
you have not been married without know
ing it. Almost any form of words will
constitute marriage, but people do pre
fer that the form be pronounced by a
minister, and certain ministers in a city
achieve popularity in this department of
clerical service.
They obtain through some attraction of
manner, or perhaps through their wllllr.jr
good nature, what would be called in busl
" ness a laree marrj'lrig connection, and
working people fiocJc in crowds at certain
-seasons to their houses to be married.
When the writer was minister of a West
Knd church in a Scotch town many years
ago he came into this proud position/but
he owed his high estate not to any gifts
of his own, and not to the demands of
his own congregation, but. to an accident
â¢ Â»of **Â«>fiTaÂ»fty. - A brotbÂ«r~clezÂ£Wnaa:~wii6 â¢
'"haa a large working class parish and- had
lived in a neighboring house toward the
West End took a living in the country
and departed without, so to say. disposing
of his matrimonial business. When the
marrying season began, which Is toward
i he summer holidays in that city, the first
couples made their way to the min
ister's house, as their friends had done
before them, in full confidence that he
would be at home on. Friday evening, as
usual, and ready to do his duty. He was
gone, and the bouse was occupied by two
maiden lades of uncertain age, and when
the first couple simply marched into the
ball and Informed a prim maid servant,
who was also past her youth, that they
had come to be married the maiden ladles
were furiously indignant, first that any
one should wish to do such a foolish
thing, end next that they should propose
to commit that folly in their house, and
finally proposed to send for the police.
The bewildered lovers left the, house
disconsolate,- and then wandering along
the terrace saw my plate, and as the
- Scots folk are not concerned who the
minister Is, so long as he be a minister,
tor, as they would say, "properly or
dained," they rang the bell, and being
now more cautious about their entrance
sent in a message from, the doorstep ask
'lng IT I would-be so obliging as to marry
\ two. folk who couldn't get a minister.
â¢' - ' " A Labor of Love.
It' is a rule of the Scots ICirk never to
refuse to marry If the papers be in order
and I immediately Invited them . Into the
study* together â¢with "the two witnesses,
whom in such circumstances they must
bring with them to identify themâ that;
they are the^ people whose names are in
the documentsâ and to be present at the
ceremony. They were, most grateful for
my heln in time of need and bade me
farewell with something approaching af
lection, and with complimentary refer
ences to the few remarks I had made by
way of ' advice. They also â¢ were *ood
enough to 'find' some .likenesses In me to
my more distinguished colleague who had
retired from business, and they promised
to mention my name in marrying circles.
It is right to say that I had only recently
beon .married myself, and that I was
<jute young: the romance of first love
must have been clinging, to me, and I
fancy my manner was very sympathetic.
When I returned "to the dra wins-room I
described,. the incident, with! fervor and
reflected with some pride upon what was
evidently a gift for the marrlace service.
Certainly I would have been disappointed
if I had never had another; visit of the
same kind, but neither I- nor my wife.

a pair of enthusiastic friends as super

our servants were quite fluttered with ex

" A Restive Bridegroom.
One could not Ignore the fact that
many of the bridegrooms had , "tastud"
freely before coming, or that their
manner was what might be called easy,
but so long as they knew, what they
were doing one made no remark and
allowed charity to cover the enthusi
asm of the occasion. There were
bridegrooms, however, who required to
be kept in hand, and whose playful
ness was apt to be embarrassing.
"John Thompson, do you take thiÂ»
woman, : ' Janet Macfarlane. to be your
lawful wedded wife?"
"That's my name, at any rate." tha
bridegroom, replied with affability,
"and you're 'no far wrong, wl* Janet's."
It was encouraging: to know thaton*
had made no mistake with the name i
and then one pressed for an answer to
'the question, but the bridegroom- bÂ«
came cautious..
' "It's a serious \u25a0 businessâ marriage."
he observed, glancing round the com
pany for support. "I'm judgm'," and
now ; he addressed me with solemnity,
"that if I say yes I'm in for it and no
mistake.. It's a risk," he, added, "an
awf u* risk."-, and then relapsing from '
.seriousness he embraced his, friends In.
a waggish glance. "Is- It to be yes?"
This was popularizing the marriage
with Â» vensreance and I Informed this
humorist, that unless he said . some
thingâand I suggested that it should
be yesâ he would leave the" house in two
minutes.
"l'e're a lad," he said with much ad
miration, but when the bride spoke to
him sharply and clearly that he should
be done with his nonsense and say
what the minister told him he sobered
down and gave his promise. A little,
later he was wandering round tha
room, examining the books with an air
of profound gravity, .while his admir
ing bride explained to "me that "ha
wasna nearly sic a fool as he looked."
A Candid Bride.
It was not always the bridegroom,
however, who raised objections and de
clined to make dangerous promises, for
a bride on one occasion took up a very
distinct and uncompromising position.
My impression was that in selecting:
her bridegroom she had been guided
not so much by the passion of youne
love, since both had come to years, of
discretion, nor by the conspicuous rir
,tues of her chosen mate, for he was not
an engaging gentleman^ but by motives
of worldly prudence. When I.asked her
whether she would love, honor and
obey this man. she answered with much
honesty and in a clear, distinct -voice
(Ignoring the question about love alto
gether):
"Respect him I canna, obey him I
wunna, but TH promise to thole <Â«n
dure) him.'*" r
The bridegroom did not seerc at all
.disappointed by this candor, and after
a careful - consideration* â¢ I read her
promise In a large and generous sensa
and took the responsibility of marry
ing them.' And if any one should blame
me for trifling- with my duty, I can
assure my critic that, much less than
they said that drfy would bind them
fast as husband and wife, according
to Scots laws.
What supported me In my action was
the remembrance of a fond mother's re-
ply when congratulated upon the en
gagement" of her daughter In a certain
Scots village.
"Oh, "aye. "we're very well pleaseu;

Dear Marlon Harland:
although not, as the old rhyme iup.s â
One of us is a bookkeeper, ancther is a stenographer
in an ofliee downtown, and I am a seamstress whose
specialty is making children's clothes. I have worked
up yuite a custom among the mothers of families who
\u25a0want really durable sewlngr done and a nice "finish"
upon babies' outfits and little girls' garments'. 1 do all
my sewing at home.
But that isn't what I want to write about. My
perplexity is one which I believe is shared by many
who are situated in somewhat the same way as our
selves. We hav-i a six-room flat, well uptown and well
toward the top of the house. We don't mind the stairs,
being young and strong, and the higher we go the bet
ter is the air and the lighter the flat. We think it
necessary to health and decent privacy to have a bed
room apiece. The kitchen being light and airy, I had
the range taken Out and the sink inclosed below and
painted white above (the sink is enameled white). I
have a pretty screen before it, making a nice bedroom
for a single woman. By this arrangement our kitchen
and our dlnlns room are the s-ame. It takes in the
whole width of the flat, has three windows, and over
looks gardcnlika back yards. Our parlor is at the other
side of the hall, and as we like to keep It neat and
pleasant for ourselves and visitors, I do all my sewing
In the dining room, or kitchen, whichever you may
please to call it. I do the cooking, too, and the market
ing for my share of the rent.
Now, I am coming to the point. One and all, we are
tired of chafing-dish "messes." and delicatessen entrees
and canned things in general, and long for wholesome
home fare. Up to now we have lived upon what house
keepers would call "left-overs" ajid â¢â¢warmed-ups."
Yetâ l haven't time to be a regular cook,. and I don't
want my work to get the "kitchen smell" we all know
so wellâ the cold-fat-and-cabbage flavor that clings to
all clothes kept in a kitchen. Wy gas cook stove is a
neat affair, but small, with room for one pan of bis
cuits or two small loaves of bread or cake, or a liny
roast or one chicken.
I don't have time to bake bread or to stop work in
the middle of the afternoon to put down meat to
mast, and anything prepared on the top of the stove
fills the place .vith the smell of cooking.
Is there a way out of my difficulty? We are hard
working girls, and need something more nourishing
than the "toss-ups" and "cold cuts." toast, tea anil
pJe upon xhich the great army of roomkeepers hall
â¢ \u25a0 roomitcs and small flat dwellers live.
PHOEBE ANN.
1 have let Phoebe Ann "free her mind"â in
class meeting phraseâ first, because she has. a
genuine grievance, and knows how to express her
appreciation of it, and "second, because I feel that
she is right in regarding therself as the representa
tive and spokeswoman of a large class of "light
housekeeping" women.
To come directly to business, let me ask if you,
my correspondent, have paid any attention to \vhat
Housemothers in Conference With Marion Harland
I AM an fntei^sted reader of your cage,
especially when there is anything con
cerning babies. I would like to say a
few words, ana will make my little as
brief as possible.
To the lady whose baby cried all the
tine when she was nursing it. I will say
that I think the poor child was undoubtedly
liungry. and I think (as you do) that she
was indeed fortunate to find an artificial
food that would agree with It. When my
first baby dime she cried and fretted all
the time. The doctor told me I should
wean ner. and. of courae. I did. I put her
on artificial food, and when the spring
came cholera infanturn took her from us.
In a few months another one came. I
had exactly the ramÂ« trouble. She was
awfully crosg. My doctor told me to
wÂ«-an her. too; but I would not do it. I
k u^ r1 54 on - and now she v * beautiful
child of 4 years.
Xow I have another, and nave had the
came trouble, with the earae advice from
f^i^^Li 00101 "- 1 t m ke Â«Pln* right on as
I did before, and he is doing finely. He
has six teeth and creeps from one end of
the hpwe to the other. He Is 8 months old.
I think I would have my little girl with
m Â« to-day If I had let the doctor alone. I
will use my own Judgment with the nest
My advice is "never put a baby on arti
ficial food unless it ts a case of life or
death." Mrs. G. B. (Pueblo. Col.).
Our Colorado member speaks words of
truth and soberness that should be
heeded and pondered by many a mother.
There is a class of doctorsâ and of
nursesâ whose stock remedy -for every
disorder of a nursing child is: "Better
wean it!" I wish I were not obliged.
as a truthful commentator, to add that
they would not" be so ready "with the
out-ami-drled formula were It not for
the belief that it Is agreeable to the
mother. There have always been women
who felt the duty of nursing their babies
after the\ manner appointed by the
Maker of us all to be a "burden," a
"nuisance." andâ as I recollect my
mother reporting as the utterance of an
acquaintance of her girlhoodâ"degrad
ing." \u0084..'
The anecdote embodied also the old
fashioned . physician's reply: i'
"Madam, the heavens do not look down
upon a more beautiful and a more sacred
spectacle than a mother nourishing her
child from her breast!"
Dear old Xature is wiser than all the
doctors graduated from all the medical
colleges and obeyed slavishly by truck
ling nurses and fashionable mothers. ";
Right thankful am I that one woman
has Judgment and will - power that
strengthen her to act for herself in a
matter so momentous. .

thought knew everything), and he said "the
scUsors was the only thing he j knew of."
So I thought I would experiment ' and see
what I could do. if the dress was spoiledâ
as it was. I took some chloroform and kept
the spot wet for some time, rubbing It
gently once In a Vhile. then washed tt In

out one lemon that. had begun to decay and
wipe the jar dry. In a day or two I had to
wipe the - jar again. . because 'the moisture
collected on it. After that they needed no
more attention. . and I ' usÂ«d . the last lemon
on the 15th of, August.' It was. almost as

all is in readiness, whisk the pot from the fire, and,
without the delay of a second, plump it into the
hollow prepared for it, shut the boxlid, and cover
all with a. thick wadded quilt or comfort, kept for
the purpose. Over the box spread a Bellagio blanket
or other ornamental cover, and give yourself no
further care as to the soup until you lay aside your
sewing at luncheon time. Turn the soup then into
a bowl set in cold water, and let it cool to throw up
the grease. Skim this off when formed, and season
the soup with pepper and salt. Draw off a quart,
strain it, add half a can of tomatoes, a teaspoonful
of sugar, and three tablespoonfuls of washed rice,
put into a smaller pot, boil for ten minutes after
the bubble really, begins, and tnck away in the re
cesses of the hay. It will be ready for the table
by 7 o'clock.
Set aside the rest of the stock in the refriger
ator for future use, and variations, leaving meat
and vegetables in it.
Excellent Glasgow broth is made by substitut
ing lean mutton for the other meats, adding half a
cup of peas to the vegetables, and, when the grease
is removed at noon, fishing out the meat and re
turning.the soup to the fire, stirring in half a cup
of barley that has soaked four hours in enough
water to cover it. Pack away as before.
Fricasseed chicken may be prepared early' in
the day; cutting the fowl apart at every joint and
putting it into the pot in the following order:
In the bottom a layer of chopped pork an inch
deep; next, minced onion sprinkled with the pork
and peppered; then pieces of chicken; over this a
lighter layer of pork and onicn, and so on until all
the materials are used up. Cover the pot closely
and set to heat very slowly at the side of the range.
(Not a drop of water.) When the contents are boil
ing hot, and there is no longer danger of scorching,
draw the pot to the front of the stove, boil ten
minutes, and consign it, still bubbling furiously and
closely shut in, to the" hay retreat.
Xext week I shall tell of pot r.oasts, casseroles
and stewed fruitsâ all prepared at the saving of
time, labor 'and- odor â incredible to the novice.

MONTH
The Food Should Have the Most
Careful Attention
By Dr. Emelyn L. Coolidge
Copy right. 1305. by A. S. "Barnes & Co.
THE nightdress should now be ot
cotton and the skirt left off at
night, if it has not already been
discarded, but the band and a
thin shirt should be worn. Long white
cotton stockings, which may be pinned
to the napkin, should be worn all sum
mer, and not short socks.
In summer it Is important to keep the
baby'e head as cool as possible; there
fore, do not use a hot sanbonnet, which
abuts off all the air; muslin caps or
light pique hats afford enough shade if
the baby has a carriage parasol.*
If one expects to take a long sea voy
age or travel a long time on the ca"rs
where fretb milk cannot be obtained, it
wIU be well to accustom the child to
taking either condensed milk or one of
the best prepared foods which can be
made with water before starting on the
Journey. Begin to do this two or three
weeks before leaving home, and give
the baby one or two meals each day of
this food. This is a good plan to follow
â¢yea If the baby is nursed by his moth
er, for she may be ill or unable to
nursÂ« her Infant for some reason, and it
Is best to be prepared for such an emer
gency.
Milk that has been rapidly cooled and
placed in sealed and sterilized glass Jars
will keep from four to six days, if kept
well packed in ice. Enough food for
twenty-four or even forty-eight hours
may be prepared at home. If it is steril
ized and packed in a little traveling
basket which contain* a Â«mall compart
ment in which to keep ice.
The formula sometimes usÂ»d for the
sixth month is: Six ounces of top milk
tkimmed from 'the- top of a quart bottle
of milk, ten ounces of milk poured off.
twenty-four ounces of barley or oatmeal
Â£ruÂ«Â»l, four teabpoorifuls of granulated
or seven cf milk su?ar, a pinch of bi
carbonate-of !--oda and a pinch of salt.
This should i>e pasieuiized, cooled in
the usukJ manner, ond .civ*n to the baby
â¢very three hours up to 9 or 10 P. M.
From four to rsx ounces may be taken
at each meal
When an <xcecdirgly hot day comes, it
Is. always wise to pour out on 2 or. even
two ouncts from each bottle of the reg
ular mixture and-*ub*t!tute boiled water
In U* place.
If the baby is at .-.11 apt to vomit. It
will l>e best during the hot weather to
use only four or lift* ounces of the top
milk instead of t-lx. und to make up the
quantity with the Â«rur>l. l.'nlesf* the
baby iÂ« Inclined to ue constipated, bar
ley gruel i^ bÂ«.'tier to use In summer
than oatmeal, lor it S" less heating.
Another pood plan. when the baby has
delicate digestive . organs, is .to make
rr.o meal a day. all through the -very
hot wcathc-r. of mutton broth, made in
the following manrer: One pound of the
nrck of mutton cut vp, on* pint of cold
water iind 3 jilrch ot salt. Cook very
tlowly f<.r three ur four hours until you
have bolt a pint, adding a Uttle water.
If" necessary, from time to time,- as it
bolls away; then y train through muslin,
and. when ccM, remove every particle
of fat. This broth may be 'added* to an
equal quantity Â»>f br.rley water, und fed
to the baby lukev.artn throusrh a nurs
ing bottle.
All thesf- simple mrasures help to. ward
oft the dreaded "summer complaint,"
and give the digestive organs less work
to do during hot weather and while the
teeth are being cut. - . ' . "

PRACTICAL AID AND PICTORIAL
DIVERSION FOR WOMEN
The Practical Applicate of the Stenographer's Knowledge
By Cynthia JVcstover Alden
Copyrlfht. 1905 by A. S. Dames & Co.
NOW a word as lo tne uwierenf
sources of employment when
you nave learned your proies
sion. Business firms employ per
haps four-fifths of all who are employed.
The age of the i>pe writer has come
upon us almost stealthily, so that It la
bad form to send out letters in some
body's iloubtful handwriting. In- ihpi
or the llrm that does It is. set. down at
once by its correspondent as either very
eccentric or very hard-up. No matter
which may be the supposition, it Is
one that repels trade. Therefore, In a
general way, It may be said that if you
know of any business houiws that has no
typewriter at work for it. there is a
chance that you may be afforded a job
there. If you can make terms with, the
management. -â¢
I need not dwell on the, necessity of
accuracy in such work. Remember
that every letter Is a contract if it
quotes prices 01 promises anything; that
your employer can be held In a court of
law to the performance of what your
typewriter makes him promise to per
form. If he dictates to you, "our price
for Each and such silk is 73 cents a
yard," and- you . write out the letter
â¢1.35." and he signs it without reading
too carefully, the receiver may answer,
"Ship me 1000 yards of such and such a
silk at quoted price." the silk may be
shipped, and no court will compel the
buyer 10 pay more than was asked. The
loss will be $400 from that one error. It
DETECTING IMITATIONS - HINTS FOR THE AMATEUR
THE detecting of Imitations in va
rious goods is an art vhut would
stand any woman in good steadâ
or a man, for that matter. In
fact, merely as n matter /of .general in
formoiion, it \s a valuable aasct. when
ever one has not. the integrity ol some
established house or pers-on to depend
upon for Judgment.
Speaking lirst of the diamond, the ex
pert's eye, without applying any tests,
will tell, at oncj the genutju>nr>*s of a
stone. A real diamond is np;iqtte; /oil
cannot ><â¢<â¢ through it at all.. Wheveas
ihe imitation is largely transport nt. or,
f.l the best, translucent. Moreover, tho
real diamond is an absolutely perfect
reflector; that is, whatever the IlKht may
be that it Is In. It ' reflects truthfully,
unS that with perfect brilliancy. "- So
that daylight it- the best in which to
test the stone, for even in that pure,
searching light, the diamond reflects the
white, clear rays. An imitation, under
such ciicumstanccs, has what - the ex
pert calls a "dead centre": there is no
brilliancy nor flre; it is dead; It. may be
remembered that imitation" stone*
always exhibited .in a room brilliantly
illuminated with artificial light,. to 4emr
all brilliancy possible. .In: honest day
light the diamond can bear tho 'scrutiny
of an â¢ eye; though, of course, : It t is
specially brilliant when under a number
of light sources, -euch as; the myriad
lights of a theatre or the dancing. rays
cast from nbovo by the leaves of trees.
One crude test of a - diamond â¢ is . the
file It roakes.no impression- whatever
upon the "real atone. Many, clever
â¢â¢fakes" will demonstrate ostentatiously
upon an Imitation, Ktekjng to prove by
the -file test that it is the real ; article.
They heat the -file, thus taking the tem
pering out'of the steel, so thai it cannot
affect the l imitation. \u25a0

casts no reflection .whatever 7 upon Its

when you have once got it . -.- business

curacy great interests may hinge. There
are one or two oiher suggestions which
I want to make about this s-ort of a
place as stenographer and typewriter.
General Usefulness
The wcrk of taking and \u25a0 writing out
letters â¢will not use up all your time.
You will probably be 'asked to do things
about the office, to assist In other ways
between times. A man would certainly
have even more of â¢ such demands if he
wore in your place". . Remember that.
And don't do what Is asked of, you as:
if it were a favor, as if you were being
imposed upon. Do Jt always as a mat
ter of course. The more you know about
the way that business is run the more
likely you will be to keep your job and
have your wages increased. Thire is no
Instance that \1 know .of where any
woman in your, place has ever got more
than $15, except as a reward for this
sort of interest in the employer's- busi
ness. There's a deop lesson In that, state
ment- of fact. : Read, It over again, jlt
will bear repeating.'; .
Clergymen, lecturers, authors " and.

CARD parties are'one of the most
popular forms of entertainment
all over this country. We grow
tired of all other games after a
while,, but cards seem to be of perennial
interest.
Notes of Invitation can be written, or
the .summons may take the shape of a
vislttng card, with the date and the
word "Cards", written In tha louver cor
ner. The former style of Invitation to
used for the smaller , affairs, the latter
for the more elaborate. The note 3

usual "to write upon every score card

being \u25a0 careful to have but twÂ© card*

them on separate trays. When the guests
come down from the dressing rooms,
request the ladles to select t&eir sccras

Eped&l Cable to The Call.
MUNICH, Nov. ISâ The following
\u25a0tory, contributed by a reader, appears
In the Augsburger Abendzeltunsr, under
the heading, "The Highest Pitch of
Conscientiousness":
"I was recently traveling from Augs
burg to Munich with an elderly gentle
man and his son. The gentleman ap
peared to be agitated about something,
and from time to time would glance at
his watch. Suddenly he jumpedup ex
citedly and pulled violently at the cord.
The train stopped almost immediately
with a terrific Jerk. All the doorsand
windows opened, and the railway offi
cialsâcarrying lanterns, it was even^
ing â ran excitedly about, inquiring
anxiously for the person who had
caused the stoppage. In due â¢ course
they arrived at our 'carriage.
"The gentleman, who was by now
quite calm, said smilingly: 'Nothing has
happened to alarm anybody. It Is now
D:3O p. m., and my little son has Just
become 10 years. old. As I only took
a half ticket for him I stopped the train
!n order to pay the other half, so that
I may not gret Into any trouble when
arriving at my destination.'
"Tableau! The eccentric gentleman
will now not only have to pay the other
half, but also $250 for stopping the
train without proper reason."

All Europe is talking of Gabriele d'Annunzio: and his difficulty in securing a divorce
- from his latest wife; and marrying his most recent sweetheart. Italy and Switzerland
refuse to help him. and -author may come to America.
Gabriele d'Ahnunzip Wants Divorce From His Wiiean Order

visit to Dakota. Otherwise the distin

in his present undertaking:, the object
of which is to get a divorce from his
wife. . :-- '.' .-' ..-...-.' \u25a0.. \u25a0 .'\u25a0 '.-

down in Lugano with the : idea- of tak

Switzerland and thus being able to free
himself of his present matrimonial
bonds. â¢-
That plan might: have worked if
author of- "The Triumph of Death".' had
been an obscure individual instead of

of romantic escapades on;.i. par with
the present one. As it, is, however, the

.Perhaps- D'Annunzio is right :in
asserting that his girl-wife did not
"understand" him. 'Perhaps she judged
masculine conduct from the \u25a0 viewpoint
of the wife] and woman, and failed to
make : allowances \u25a0 for the ;of

' .Eleanora '" Duse's experience with
D'Annunzio was not- much happier. For
several; years their- names were coupled
together, an association which * they
never dreamed. of denying, and in the
meantime the actress persisted in play
ing; the poet's \u25a0 \u25a0tragedies, to ; the un
doubted; detriment .of her artistic repu
tation, and spent money freely in stag
ing and bringing them out. In this -way
it is said she dropped a million, to.be
rewarded by being put in : a novel, "11
Fuoco','â or. "The .Flame"â and ; having
her most â¢ intimate" thoughts^ and acts
held up to public gaze. The publication
of /this book, however, undoubtedly hurt
D'Annunzio ; . even with his most con
stant admirers, and it gave rise to a
bitter quarrel with; his. heroine. . The
breach,"-- however/ was made up * after,, a
while and D'Annunzio's "Daughter of

standing that Duse should have the

t-udderily, discovered that; his a former
idol, was- too old for the part of -the

too far. Duse has not looked at 'him

IÂ£>NDON, Nov. IS.â A clever young
Kensington woman. Miss Evans, has
devised a new kind of autograph
album that Is likely to be popular. It
la contrived so as to enable the youny
woman not only to collect the auto
graph signatures ot her friends, but to
preserve also the Imprints ot their
kisses.
The book is equipped with a little
pad of a soluble carmine-tinted sub
stance upon which the lips first are
lightly pressed so as to take up a little
of ! the pigment. \u25a0
Then the kiss is imprinted upon the
page in a space provided, for the pur
pose, leaving a clear carmine record of
the pressure of the lips. By the side
of the kiss print space is another for
the autograph and the date, and to
gether the kiss and the signature make
a precious and intimate keepsake.
"It is really marvelous what a lot
of character there is in kisses," says
Miss Evans. "People who are not stu
dents of the subject have no idea how
they -vary. You know no two persona
have finger prints alike, and so no two
persons' kisses are the tiniest bit alike.
Â»*."*" JWi^^^M .In Â°ne album and there
is not one of them' that you could pos
sibly .mistake for any other. The kiss
prints look like kisses, too.
"The kiss album bears on the title
page the motto:
'* 'Give me a kiss for a keepsake and
a quotation dear as the remembered
kisses.*
! "To be complete the kiss album
should be sprinkled liberally with kiss
ing quotations from novelists aa well as

BUDA-PESTH. Nov. 18.â The suburb
of Ujpest has been the theater of a re
markable love tragedy. A young work
man named Westmayer became en
gaged to a pretty dressmaker a short
time ago, and the day of the wedding
was fixed.
However, two of the girl's neighbors
sought out the workman and poured a
tale .of slander into his , ear. In the
evening Westmayer sought an explana

dignantly denied the allegations made
against her. But her lover was not sat
isfied, and declared that he would not
marry her.
Too proud to ask him to take back
his word," the girl showed him the door
of her. lodgings. Westmayer, realizing
that he had made a -mistake, implored
his sweetheart's pardon. (It was not
accorded. Then, seized with fury, he
shot the sirl dead, and was in the act
of taking his own lifu when neighbors
rushed on the scene and knocked up hla
arm- as he was about to turn the
weapon on himself. Only a slight
wound was inflicted on his shoulder.

Actress lienonnec* L'*>e Â«f Patntpot as
' Death to .Natural Play of
the Features.
PARIS. Nov. 18. â Eleanora Duse, dur
ing a flying visit, in which she gave one
not very successful performance of
Gorky's "Night Refuge," startled this
city of rouge and makeup by a vehe
ment denunciation of all conventional
artifices of theatrical embellishment.
She said:
"ilakeup is death to the natural play
of physiognomy; it destroys the elas
ticity by which the face expresses the
Infinite variety of the passions of the
soul; it annuls facial eloquence; it
means a tramp the less in th<* artist's
play. Instead of a face living and
speaking, there' is only a mask of
marble or wax, a dummy from a hair
dresser's "window.
"People are astonished,' too, at the
carelessness of my headdress, but In
life, under passionate emotion, all arti
fice disappears and only the soul move
ment shows, bending and twisting the
body ft?_a blast shakes the \ forest trees,
careless of its crown of leafage. "What
matters it that my hair be disordered
if I be true to the passion of the play?"
Mme. Le Barg has become a convert
to the Duse theory. She; abjures tho
art of the paintpot, as she describes it,
and begins to pride herself on the time

marked for the beauty of decoration of
the hall, the many members assembled
to greet her and the large number at

raillery and all felt better Tor having
been addressed by this very fraternal
and truly loyal member, who always
says the right thing at the right time.

thÂ« grand president was given a beau
tiful souvenir dish, and the president of

AND THE
MUSIC FOLK
Shakespeare. Schiller. Moliere, with
"Dr. Jfkyll and Mr. Hyde" as tailpiece!
Mansfield, of course, and how deliciously
characterlstie'. And how characteristical
ly delicious! It is lovely as Irving's pen
chant for "The Bells"â or George Ster
ling's passion for "double pedro!"
H is lovely as will be the rush for Mans
field's "Why I Like to Play 'Dr. Jekyll
and Mr. Hyde' ": when that interesting
brochure and "Why I Thought I Oughter
Play 'Don Carlos,' " come out! Please
order for me, Mr. Robertson.
In the meantime, it is with Schiller that
Mr. Mansfield begins his engagement to
morrow evening at the Grand Opera
house, in his own and R. D. Boylan's
adaptation of "Don Carlos." It will be
the first time the drama will have been
presented here, as It .has been the ac
tor's heroic task of presenting the drama
In English for the first time anywhere,
at its recent premiere In Toledo, O. The
praise heroic has been accorded to Mr.
Mansfield's achievement, both aa expo
nent of the name role and as the judi
cial and sympathetic adapter of the Schil
ler tragedy.
A tremendous task, my masters. Take
the blue-penciling alone. How "Don
Carlos" compares in length with the
lengthiest dramas I do not know. But to
"Hamlet's" 3715 lines of verse; to "Rich
ard Ill's" 3CC3 lines; to "Othello's" 3130
lines, "Don Carlos" tots up no fewer than
5<71 lines of verse. Schiller's own "Wallen
stein" alone of the great poetic dramas
compares, with Its 7639 lines. Ben Greet
took a day, one remembers, or, more
correctly. five hours, to his uncut
"Hamlet."' This, too. in the Elizabethan
fashion, without intervals for scene-set
ting or aught but the mere playing of
the play. With Its 1G56 more Hr.es. and
the necessary time for setting the scenes,
"Don Carlos" in its entirety should thus
take only about eight hours to play!
Something of' the magnitude of Mr.
Mansfield's ta k thus becomes apparent.
To condense an eight-hour play Into a
three-hour frame, to keep the essentials
of the story, to hold clear the thread of
the plot, to keep the figures at their rela
tive values In the picture, and to retain
In addition the most beautiful portions of
the poetic expression of the drama is the
simple skeleton of the work. But It Is
said that Mr. Mansfield has done all these
things in a fashion befitting the now fore
most representative of the English-speak
ing stage, besides presenting a portrait
of th* Sncnish Hamlet that ranks with
his most notable contributions to the cur
rent drama.
Three times the play will be seen, on
Monday and Saturday of this week and
Wednesday of next. For "Don Carlos."
"Ri. hard III," and "The Merchant of
Wnice," the curtain will rise at 8
o'clock.
I.t is- faiii also that Mr, Mansfield's
presentment of the Moliere "Misan
thrope" ip the first of the English pres
entations of the comedy, presumably in
America, for the play has been not in
frequ?ntly done in England. Certainly it
is the first local production, and an un
mitigated pleasure to look forward to.
As Alceste. the sensitive, the pessimist,
the proud, posed among the brilliant and
\u25a0willful mesdames cf his brilliant and will
ful day. Mr. Mansfield has an oppor
tunity as rare as it is fascinating in
promise.
It seems incredible, but the actor will
this season make his first appearance
here in his long-famed Skakespearean
portraiture. But so It is. His Richard
111. which role flies to the tongue in
the Mansfield connection even here where
it is known only by hearsay, is one of
the parts in which he will appear. The
other is Shylock. _.
Not for many years before has "Rich
ard III" been done here, and the produc
tion has aroused a corresponding interest.
Then there is "The Merchant of Ven
ice." whose Jew is Mr. Mansfield to be
seen upon the same stage where the
Yiddish Shylock. Ellis Glickman. lately
asked bis: "Hath a Jew ears?" so nobly.
Perhaps these are the most famed of the
Mansfield Shakespearean characteriza
tions, and both have aroused a tremen
dous interest. Notable here too will be
the splendor of the settings, for which
the handsome stage of the Grand Opera
house affords such an excellent oppor
tunity.
The immortal "Beau Brummel" is also
of the company of plays, that classic of
decadence "A Parisian Romance," andâ
"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."
One thing. It is advised that Mr.
Mansfield be not missed this time. His
contracts now determine at least a three
years' absence from the West. Before
his last visit it was nine before he de
termined to wade out here again. Voila!

NOT "OPERA MAD" BUT
TBTRAZZINI CRAZY
A great man, my, masters, Slgnor Geor
glo Polacco. A great man, great among
the world conductors last Wednesday
night's .symphony concert anew and be
yond doubt stamped him. By- far the
most significant musical affair of the
season the concert was. . Close 'of the
opers> season, the ogcasionwas^ a testi
monial benefit to the conductor, when, as
with the actress who plunges Into Ibsen
or Browning at her special matinee as
relief from the plays that bring in her
bread and butter. Polacco" chose to give
us symphony. Beethoven. Wagner. Salnt-
Saens, Weber, Welngartner, Mf. Polacco
gave us. through^the medium of the regu
lar Tivoli orchestra, augmented by sev
enteen members, in all, sixty-seven. And
the new revelation of the conductor, was
r.o whit more remarkable than the reve
lation of ahc new strength and worth r of
the men. It seems, quite safe to say .'that
never before has such excellent ; l<3cai; ma
terial been available; and almost?.super
fluous to cay that it has never been better
led, perhaps never so well. â¢
The other revelation of the occasion was
hardly so pleasant. *It concerns trie
audience. Let it be remembered that this
was the one symphony concert of the sea
son, when all â¢is said 'of opera at' 'its
beautifulest: the one occasion of '\u0084 the
year when . pure music, the highest kind
of pure musicâ the orchestral, was the at-

seats vacant.. Still a good house? A large
house to fill? True, but. as an intelligent
person who keeps tab on things reminded
me, there have been twelve pay-formances
of "LuciaV this season, and hardly space
for foot, toehold to at any of; them. . So
with "Traviata" ;: so with "Dlnorah."
En passant,- superficially. ; the -figures
would seem to stamp us not "opera mad,"
but J Tetrazzini , crazy. But, essentially,
this is not so. : Essentially, the Tetrazzini
crowds went for the best-sung opera the};
could get and Tetrazzini gave.it to them.-
Put a soprano of. equal worth into" the
"Boheme," the "Otello.V the "Manon

dash, sweep, swing, one of course ex
p>cted. but the flnish. the distinction â
always and above everything the dis
tinctionâthe precision, the sensitive
ness of shading-, the full nobility of the
response to the noble demand, one
hardly dared to expect. But it was of
the "miraculous things, as Polacco owns.
Not in eleven days of rehearsals â nor
rehearsals shown by union standards â
he says, was he able to get so much
from the Italian orchestras.
And so with a great "Amen!" closes
the season.
Edward Baxter Perry, the -well
known blind pianist, composer and lec
turer, will be the next musical visitor
of importance. Mr. Perry appears next
Friday evening at Lyric Hall, under
Mr. Will Greenbaum's direction, in a
first lecture-recital that will be given
over to a programme ' containing num

lecturer. Mr. Ferry will analyze each";,
composition played.
At the second and last recital, on
Sunday afternoon next, the programme

on the Polish legend of the "Swltzer
Maid." by Mickiewlcz; Godard's "TrtJ-"
by." founded on the French tale. "Tril
by, the Fire Sprite." by Gautler; Saint-.
Saens' "Danse Macabre," a musical set
ting of the French legend of Hallow
een, and other compositions founded on
legendary lore.
Mr. Perry asks no consideration from
his audience on account of his blind
ness, it is said. and. emphatically, the
lectures should appeal, to students. A
contingent of musical students from
the Institution for the Blind at Berke

LONDON. Nov. 13.â The "Liberal
week" in Manchester closed with an
unpleasant incident. Two women have
been sent to prison as a sequel to In
terrupting the .meeting in the Free
Trade Hall. Manchester, at which Sir
Edward Grey was the principal speak
er.
The , prisoners are Miss Christabel
Pankhurst, who recently applied to be
admitted to the bar, and who is one
of the foremost champions of, women's
rights in Manchester, and MIS 3 Kenney
of Oldham. They went to the meeting
to hear the views of the Liberal". party
on the question of woman suffrage, and
so persistent were they In their inter
ruptions and efforts to make a speech
that they had to be ejected by force.
It was. said that Miss . Pankhurst.
when asked to be quiet, spat in the
faces of a police superintendent and an
inspector. Before the magistrate Miss
Pankhurst said her conduct was a pro
test against the legal position of
women. As they both refused to pay
the fines Inflicted by the magistrate,
they were sent to prison for seven days.

IS GAMBLING
A SMART SET
SIN?
Do you play cards?
Do you play for fun or for moneyâ or
for both?
Jf you be a member of that section of
society designated as leisure, or smart,
or fashionable, or rich, of course. you
playâ if you have head enough. It takes
brains to play bridge, or whist, and these
are the smart games. Five hundred? Oh.
that's left to children and Incompetentsâ
and it has few devotees in society.
And thus it is not of 500â a mathemat
ical disguise for "Old Maid^â that the
raucous social reformers are howling.
It's all about those sinful games
wherein high stakes are played.
Now. fanatics of any sort do not need
much fuel to set their inflammable brains
afire.
airs. Russell SagÂ© and a few folk, most
ly clerics nearer at home, have discov
ered that in high life some pretty stiff
games have been planned and played, to
the crippling of happiness and honor
sometimes the irremediable crippling of
feminine honor. And they blatantly cry
out that gambling is a vice of the class,
and call upon high heaven to wreak
vengeance tij>on the evil-doers.
Of course you knowâ and I knowâ that
gambling in its crudest, grossest phase is
a pet pastime (or workUme) with some
apparently pretty nice people.
You know, and I know, how the trick is
turned. A. couple of guestsâ men or bach
elor girlsâ are asked to dine.
Dinner over, a little game is suggested
to pass the hour, and lo!â the guests
find themselves playing against a sharp,
ehrewd, alert woman, no longer the com
plaisant hostess, playing with the in
tensity of a professional, andâ you know
it as well as Iâ cheating. If her luck goes
against her, and cheating neatly.
That these conditions exist, every one
familiar with society knows, and knows
definitely. But to say that these condi
tions are peneral Is stupid, unjust and
bitter, and reflects the quality of brain
of the would-be reformers.
Talking of raps at card-players who
play for prizesâ and the truth to tell
many women play to win prizes (as dis
tinct from money) as they never would
work for the redemption of their souls.
The "Washington authorities have re
fused, in reply to a query, to forward
through the mails any newspaper that
publishes a list of names, the owners of
which had won prizes at cards at society
affairs.
The test case arose in Dcs Molnes.
where some Puritanical burgher objected
to the use of the paper for the dissemina
tion of such news, and laid the matter
before the Washington authorities.
The wise ones at the capital, after due
deliberation, declared that euchre, bridge
and whist cases were identical with raf
fles, policies and lotteries, and declared
unequivocally against them â but "that
the department had never seen fit to en
force the statute covering such cases."
Now. that would give the card players
a Joltâ the characterization of their fun
as unlawful, and the results unfit for
publicationâ wouldn't it?
Don't worry, though. Washington
hasn't yet sent its ukase out West, so
play away and be merryâ but don't cheat,
and don't send your guest away broke^
It's bad form.

PUPIL ASSAULTS
HIS PRINCIPAL
KaymoiMl Duham Viciously
Attacks Adolph Herbst of
the Adams Cosmopolitan
Adolph Hfrbst. principal of the Adams
Cctmcpolitan Grammar School, appeared
before the Board of Education yesterday
and riled a? complaint, that-Raymond-Du
ham, a pupil in Miss Anna M. Grozelier's
clasr, had viciously assaulted him in the
school yard last Tuesday. Herbst's face
bcre evidence of the terrible blows in
flicted by Duham, who is fourteen years
of age.
According: to the story told by Herbst.
who nas bf-en in the school department
for thirty-four years and is well along '
in years, Duham committed the assault
after he had been accused of hitting
Herbst in the back of the neck with an
apple while the classes were going into
the school ouilding. After being slapped
In the face by Herbst. Duham punched
Herbst twice Jn the face and the- latter
has been in bed ever since the occur
rence, only arising yesterday to lay his
I complaint before the Board of Education.
*m Herbst's face is terribly swollen and dis
y<olored and he says he may swear out a
\u25a0warrant against Duham for battery.
Herbst will recommend that Du
. ham be expelled and the pupil
and his parents will be cited
to appear ' before the board and Su
perintendent Langdon to show cause why
he should not be expelled. If he falls to
make a satisfactory explanation Herbst's
recommendation will be- approved.
Herbst's gtory of the assault Is as fol
lows:
"While the classes were being lined up
I was hit in the neck with an apple. 1
euspected that Duham was the culprit
and I went to his class room and ac
cused him of doing so. He denied that
he threw the apple, but I did not believe
him and I slapped him for the offense.
Thereupon he struck me twice with his
clenched fist and nearly knocked me un
conscious. Duham ran away after his
act."
Superintendent of Schools Langdon
closely Questioned Herbst regarding the
particulars of the attack, but the latter
stuck to his story as he first told it
He said he had his spectacles on when
struck by Duham. It was brought out
during the cross-questioning that Herbst
had slapped Duham once before for

The School Directors say that Herbst
has been in the habit, contrary to the
rules, of striking his pupils on the slight
est provocation and some time ago he
was reprimanded for slapping a girl pu
pil in the face. However, the Board of
Education does not consider that fact
any extenuation for the assault com
mitted by Duham on his principal. It is
said that after Duham struck Herbst the
latter could not see for several minutes
and he has since suffered greatly from
the effects of the blows. Duham lives at

pleased with the result of [ his â¢ vJsit.U. The
general Intends to \ make many, such visits
and the members- of "the I company; to! be

It lis expected ; that this manner, 1 of in

regular yearly ' inspection, \u25a0\u25a0-, will j | have " a
tendency to make the officers and ' mem

THE MEDICINE BUSINESS.
*-T">HE discussion going on about proprietary medicines brings
I into view the magnitude of that business. Its legitimacy is
* established by the millions invested in it, and by the univer
sality of the use "of such preparations. This immense business is
the successor of the "domestic medicine" habit of our revered
grandmothers. They laid in a store of herbs and; roots. They
gathered thyme and tansy, hoarhound, pennyroyal and boneset, cat
nip and cranesbill, Solomon's seal, lobelia, slippery elm, prickly ashi
mandrake and burdock. Seneca snake root and cherry bark, and in
them had a battery of sudorifics, tonics, astringents, carminatives,
physic and emetics, which they opened on the flcsiily ills of the
household, while waiting for the distant doctor.
. Then came the adaptive genius of the patent medicine men and
combined the essential principles of these natural products in pow
ders, pills and syrups, plasters and poultices, and the enormous
proprietary medicine business had its genesis. It has pushed be
yond the domestic pharmacopoeia and plucked prescriptions out of
the materia medica. and has taken over the leading official prepara
tions and added them to ,its properties. It has reached such dc
veiopment as to be the subject of special stamp taxation whenever
the Government wants to pay for a war or buy an island, and the
Panama canal may be built in part by the contributions of powders,
pills and bitters.
Complaint is sometimes made that people don't know what
they are taking when they .go to the cupboard and take down; the
medicine bottle and take a. dose to relieve "a misery." isut.it .may
be safely assumed that it is not hurtful, for that woufd destroy the
business of the manufacturer. Far out upon the plains and prairies
and deserts doctors are few and far between. Herbs and roots, for
cathartic and emetic purposes are not obtainable, and so a proprie
tary medicine that has established itself as a family friend is. resorted
to with that confidence which is part of the cure, if there be any
thing in suggestive therapeutics. Even the regular profession admits
the virtue of many of these preparations and their tuse is not ob
noxious to the code of ethics. . .- . .
Of course, as the quack hovers on the edge of the medical pro
fession, the maker of worthless proprietary medicines tries 10 make
money by working in the wake of the masters of the business, but
his career is usually brief, inglorious and unprofitable, for there
must be some merit in a preparation to maTce its production profit
able. So we have the herbalist school of medicine and the domestic
remedies of herbs, roots and bark, blossoms and gums, all absorbed
by the proprietary medicine people, and a great industry has grown
up, and upon it are impinged a large number of collateral occupa
tions. The gathering and growing of medicinal herbs employ thou- a
sands of people. The glass bottle trade would suffer a great loss
if proprietary remedies were abolished. The label printing alone is
2ii enormous collateral of this business. Millions are spent in ad
vertising, which is felt by the printers, type founders, ink makers
and press manufacturers. Indeed it is doubtful if any other busi
ness radiates as far. in as many different directions, or into as many
gainful callings as this. If the preparations were harmful or even if
they were merely passive or negative, they would not succeed. The
test is the use, and people will use them for. the observed effects,
as a resort in emergencies, or a substitute for a regular prescription.
The business is just now under fire, either to make a reputation
for certain publications, or because the writers of the attacks have
used the wrong bottle. The medical profession does not seem to
be interested in it. Indeed these proprietary remedies do net seem
to obsolete the services of the doctor, and the medical schools are
full of students of the healing art. The public health does not suffer
from their universal employment, for men live longer now than they
did before proprietary medicine was known. It is safe to assume
that this vast business will survive the attacks that are .made on it
and that its substitutes for the kindly medication of the ancient
housewife will lose none of their popularity.
CALIFORNIA IN IT.
THAT was a long streak of lightning that started in the in
surance investigation in New York and struck in California. We
have to import our lightning, for it is not indigenous, and of
course this lot from abroad found no rods up. So far every revela
tion in the investigation of the big companies in New York indi
cates the necessity for a preventive remedy, that will protect the
insurance companies on one hand and the people on the other.
For a quarter of a century or more the insurance business of
this country has been raided by State Legislatures and by State
Insurance Commissioners. We by no means say that air bills on
insurance introduced into Legislatures are cinches, but the most
of them are. Nor do we say that all State Commissioners of In
surance are grafters, but most of them arc. If a bill is introduced
into a Legislature to cinch the insurance business, what is that busi
ness to do about it? Shall it accept ruin or buy off the cincher ?
The remedy is in putting the* insurance business on a' basis ap
proximating that of the national banks under Federal 'jurisdiction
and regulation. When lightning starts in New York and strikes in
California, being insurance lightning, we assume that those who are
dodging the bolt will admit that insurance has an interstate quality,
and is subject to Federal regulation. \u25a0
The shakeup in the big companies in New York is timely. Their
policy holders want their solvency maintained and their business
reinvested with public confidence. To fail in this will visit the
direst consequences upon hundreds of people, who have for years
paid their premiums and whose families cannot afford to lose the
results of much economy and sacrifice. The scarlet sins, of the
McCalls and the McCurdys should hot be expiated by these innocent
policy holders. . â¢
The Federal Government should extend jurisdiction over in
surance as interstate commerce, and subject v it to such rigid over
sight as will guarantee the solvency of the companies and the safety
of their policy holders. Then there will be no more State cinch bills
and no more State Commissioners who require so many professional
nurses as seem to have been necessary, aforetime, in California. V
QUAKER CITY WATER.
THE reform movement, carried to a successful. end in Philadel
phia by Mayor Weaver, has disclosed the nature of theP rich
pickings found by politicians in public ownership. The water
supply, always owned by that city, >yhsifor/:.years^o!.defiled'yaS'Jt6!
cause frequent typhoid epidemics. After many serious experiences a
filtering plant was projected. This plant ispartially completed, and
the city superintendent of filtration is in jail ? for grafting on the
work. An army engineer has been appointed to succeed liim.arifj; it
is revealed that in the execution -of the work $C,ooo,cco has been
stolen from the city.
The Quakers should exert themselves to make Mayor Weaver's
reform movement the permanent fashion of the city, for the in
genuity mat could steal that much in building^ a filter could easily
steal the rest of the city in running it. Wcdonotallege that public
ownership and. operation arc necessary to breed gtxft and furnish op-;
portuhity for theft, for cities that o/yn no utilities are robbed. ABui;
public ownership furnishes the easiest means of robbery. Especially
is this the case when the plant is not independent of the general
fund, \yiien deficits can be, charged off. to the. generai fund,. theft
is easily conccalable, and neither ratepayers nor taxpayers know
what public ownership is costing them. i . ""'.'\u25a0"
The public utilities of Philadelphia have furnished the easy; op
portunity to steal tens of millions of idollars; anclVthe: evidence^ is
indisputable that the opportunity^ has not been neglected. If reform

FEATURES OF
CAMPUSSPORT
IN FOOTBALL
THE best- and worst features of
campus sport are found most
sharply defined In football, writes
Ralph L>. Paine in the November Cen
tury. Now the fact seems often over
looked that the average American
youths Is both honest by instinct and
keen for fair play. He enters college
with a normal fondness for outdoor
pastime. As Â«ne of his first impres
sions he learns that the football team
Is a "complicated machine of infinite
exactitude," from which the youth \u25a0of
average ph/Jlcal equipment is well
nigh barred. Then he discovers that
the kind of game played by the few
picked heroes is so difficult and exhaust-
Ing that th* three months* season sug
gests slavery far more thansport. He
grasps 'the fact that rowing Js a pur
suit which demands a long and ardu
ous training period in ord*r -to drill
eight men Into absolute harmony of ac
tion, Â«nd he does not see how working
for the crew could be made any easier.
But football, in .bracing autumn weath
er, looks as if it ought to. offer a fair
field to any strong and plucky youth
willing to endure hard knocks. Really
there ought to be much fun In It, he
thinks.
He flnd3, however, that players, train
ers and coaches are thinking of nothing
else than together eleven
brawny giants into certain battering
ram" formations the Impetus of which
shall be more deadly, and lasting than
that of a rival mass of beef and muscle
on a certain afternoon three months
distant. The freshman, standing In dis
consolate idleness on the side lines,
percetves also that In a university of
perhaps. two or three thousand students
It Is not considered possible to assemble
eleven men of the standards of phy
sique and intelligence required to form
a "championship team," wherefore It
is necessary to recruit among the pre
paratory schools and to throw out
drag-nets for promising material
among the smaller colleges. And this
youngster of ours may be wise enough
to glimpse the fact, which has eluded
most of his perplexed elders busy with
making more "rules," that the problem
of keeping football clean in school and
college rests not so much with the player
as with the game Itself.
In other words, a pastime which la so
hard to play well, which, contains so few
of the essential elements of sport, and
which cannot, find its raw material
among thousands of willing , young men
within Its own bounds, is certain to breed
perverted ideas of the spirit and object
of normally conducted -amletics for the
benefit of the greatest possible .number.
"Professionalism" In football would be
shorn of Its temptations to "win at any
cost" if the game were such as the aver
age student could learn to play well ana
to enjoy.
SLEEPING MALADY.
A number of cases of coma have been
manifest in lowa during the past month,
and persons have slept from eight days
to fifty-six without waking, says the El
dorado, lowa, correspondent of the New
York World. Mason City had Jhe strang
est case in William- Burke, who slept for
nearly 60 days and died without hav
ing been awake once. A lady in the
same town was in a comatose state for a
considerable lensth of time, but finally
awakened and Is to-day, alive and well.
In Clinton County Kuth Herrlngton, a
fifteen-year-old school girl, was in some
kind of a trance for eight days. On .Aug
ust 31 the girl said she was gain? to- take
a short ' naix. At 5 o'clock, -\u2666 when the
mother came to awaken her daughter. s ha
failed to rouse her and discovered that
her jaws were tightly set. A physician
tried his best to awaken the girl, but
was unable to do so. Cold baths and
electricity, . which were Immediately, ap
plied.. proved of no avail. Two hours lat
er consciousness partly returned to the
sleeper, although she did not open her
eyes. She endeavored to communicate
to the watchers at her bedside in tha
mute language of the deaf and dumb â the
j finger alphabet.
i For four days the jaws of the patient
i were set tightly, but at the end of that
time they relaxed and the physician was
able to administer liquid nourishment and
medicine. From then on her Improvement ~ K
was more marked. . ; \
The stupor was succeeded by a sleep of, j
a more natural kind and on the morning *
of the eighth day she awoke -I her usual
health and arose as though she had just
finished a refreshing sleep of a few *
hours* duration. â¢ .
There has been no recurrence of thÂ©
strange condition, and physicians are of
the opinion that Miss Herrlngton will not
be troubled again. She has no recollec
tion of the eight days* slumber.'

AND SOME OTHER BOOKS
"THE SCIENCE OF THE SOCIAL,
PROCESS" is the shortest good defini
tion that can be given of the study we
â¢ all sociology, and one of the newest,
completest. briefest and most beauti
ful statements of the nature of that
ever proceeding thing is this: "The
social process is the incessant evolu
tion of persons through the evolution
of institutions, which evolve completer
persons, who .evolve completer institu-
tions. and so on beyond any limit that
we can fix." This is one selected - out
of a number scattered through an elab
orate new work on "General Sociology. '
by Albion W. Small, professor and head
of the department of sociology in the
University of Chicago. The, volume is
an exposition of the main development
fin sociological theory .from Spencer to
Ratzcnhofer. It professes only the
humble service of a conspectus, claim
ing no more than that It is a, point of
view, first about the reality in ques
tion, and second about ways of inquiring
into the reality. It is not written wholly
for professional sociologists â there are
few of these â but as "the great value of
sociology to most people will be an in
direct consequence of its furnishing a
point of view, a perspective, an atmo
sphere, which will help to place all the
problems of life with which each has to
deal," this book will be useful to orient
overy individual who wishes to advance
toward proficiency In the fine art of
conduct.
Another definition is this: "Sociology
is an attempt so to visualize and so to
interpret the whole of human expe
rience that It will reveal the last dis
coverable grounds upon which to base
conclusions about the rational conduct
of life." That is good enough, but I
think by contrasting it with the other
definition you will find .that the first I
gave you has the addition of a plus
element to it; it has something of the
glow and glory to it of leading the
imagination to conceive of the theory
we call evolution as a something
stretching up and away into an infinity
and eternity of perfections as yet un
dreamed of by the units of society. Xow
that impression is typical of the whole
book. It is sociology with a glow to it.
While you read it you feel a realizing
sense that In the seeming self-surrender
of a part, of our individual preferences
*\ and happiness and liberties for the good
of the great social organism we are
helping forward "that one far-off divine
event to which the whole creation
moves." ; . . .
If we wish to analyze the definition fur
ther, and ask what is a process, we find
it. far along in the book condensed Into
this: "A process is a collection of occur
rences, each of which has a meaning for
every other, the whole of which consti
tutes some sort of becoming." The au
thor's optimism shows In the statement
that this process ten4s to put an Increas
ing proportion of individuals in posses
sion of all the goods which have been dis
covered by the experience of humanity.
As for our duty in understanding sociol
ogy he cays:' "The social process, as we
â¢Jind it among men thus far, bears testi
mony that" the inclusive aim which men
should set Up for themselves ought to be
\Ti}s' perfe*tifcn of "social' co-ooeMUieh,'-to
The end that the lot of every person in
the world may be to share. In a progress
ively widening proportion, in all the de
veloping, content of the most abundant
life. â¢ * â¢ More and better life by more
and better people, beyond any limit of
time or quality that our minds can set. is
the indicated content of the social pro
cess."
In speaking of the advance in sociol
ogical thought he tells us that associa
tions are now studied more functionally
than structurally, as was characteristic
of Ep.encer; and our working test of all
functional worth must be our teleological
concepts. "The sociologist is after the
telic meaning of. all social factors." A
characteristic of the book is Its working
out of the view that individualistic strug
t pie is just a stage of progress through
which humanity is passing toward a co
operation which will make the social or
ganism ever closer to a harmonious
whole. Indeed in one of the analogies
this social union, of which we are more
or less discordant units. Is to liken It to
the leader of an orchestra who is ever
striving to bring the whole Into harmony.
Here is a . view of sociology which may
be new to many: "National life is, con
flict, but it is a conflict converging toward
minimum conflict and maximum co-oper
ation and sociability." In this Increasing
completeness of the social bond Individu
alism is to be left free to this extent,
that, while civilization approaches inclu
sion of -all Interests so far as they depend
upon united action, scope is left for lib
erty in -those pursuits in which individ
uality best realizes the common Interests.
As for the part which conflict plays in
evolution he is keenly alive to making us
aware of it, and yet he looks upon it as
only the mode of a movement to heights
beyond It. "Struggle must overcome
struggle and prescribe the limits and laws
of struggle, and at last transform itself
Into socialization- We thus make out the
main tendency of civic struggle to be the
ultimate harmonization of all interests.
This result we. call socialization or civil
ization^ To what extent. this harmoniza
tion will prove possible it is unnecessary
to predict- We can see far enough into
the tendency to reach teleological ground
, that Is secure." The argument of the
. book is that the pursuit of super-indi
vidual ends becomes a part, and an in
creasingly important part, in the whole
social process."
The outline given in this 700-page
work of Professor Small gives the skel
eton of a lecture course that would oc
cupy four hours per week 'or an aca
demic year and a programme of sem
inar work in sociological methodol
ogy to extend through three years. It
is said to represent in a general way
the point of view ot the sociological de
partment of the University of Chi
cago, though the members of it may
differ as to conclusions about details.
One of the main purposes of the volume
seems to be the indorsement of the
sociologist, Ratzenhofer, not as to the
conclusions he draws from his analyses,
but as to the correctness of his meth
ods of pursuing, the study and as to its
newness being an admirable innovation
jind making a. clear-cut, advance in
methodology over former systems of
sociology, ever, those of such great men
as Spencer and the disciples of Adam
Smith. Spencer Is said to have*. been
chiefly occupied in showing: "that"
functions are, and the new method Is
to sh~ow "what" functions are. Spencer
treated functions structurally, and tho
modern thing- is the importance of
treating .functions functionally. \u25a0
The author says it has .been a labor
-of love Tor him to piJnt out the sig
nificance of Hutzehhofer'B contribution
to sociological method. - Part IV of the
v/ork, consisting of 320 pages, .Is de
voted to an interpretation Â«f Ratzen
hoftr, and the title of \u25a0 that part is
"Society considered nsa process
of adjustment by conflict between as
soclauÂ«d: Individuals." : In i: a : - chapter
called Thetransltlon.froin, struggle to
co-operation" (whleh^chapter fs a. sort
of keyryte.to one ' ( bt:_ the most 'master-
fully advanced Ideas of the new work),,
the method of sociology is stated thus:
"The problem is to btate and interpret,
h.s a coherent whole, the facts of human
experience. The method is .not, metaj
physical in any sense; It is rioi symbol
ical, or analogical, or Indirect,* in in/
senso. It is a matter-of-fact 'general*
ization of the workings of t
human interest;-; as they manifest them
selves in types of individuals and in
type? of association."
It would take many pages to fully
explain, but here Is a fragment from
that chapter on the "Transition from
i struggle to co-oueration" thit will give
| a hint of one of the main lines* of
: thought in the volume: -. -
j " â¢ â¢ our thesis is that, along
i with out-and-out struggle â i. c., self
\u25a0 assertion of the extrernest type â and
j along with the externally socialize!
, self-assertion ' which recognizes the
1 self-interest of pooling: issues with
others, a factor iiuite different in tem
per develops in the course of. the social
.process. W<? have called this the co
operative, or civilizing f.icton. .The ten
dency which it pro.motes begins to man
ifest itself before there is a sure evi
dence of conscious purpose 'to co-op
eratoand to civilize." .Now as to the
newness and the value of Ratzenhofer's
method, the closing paragraph of the
i chapter says this: "The peculiar mpriv
j of Ratzenhofer's work is that it. pre
sents a more- realistic survey of the
whole scope of the social process than
arty previous system had . contained.
We have had sociologies, and in par
ticular social psychologies, of a vacuum,
j of imaginary *ocieti?s. and of scraps
of society. \Vr. have yet to construct a
sociology that rests upon valid induc
tion from the actual social process.
Ratzenliofer has gone beyond ail his
predecessors in plotting the whole scop'j
of the process and in proposing tenta
| tive formulas of correlation. The sort
I of thine that he exhibits is the stuff of
| which objective sociology .must be;
| made."
It will be observed from this position
of our author's that comprehensive so
ciological knowledge is so far from be
ing as yet an actual achievement that
it is considered very meritorious prog
ress in any modern sociologist - mwely
to have mapped out a plan upon which
to base the science of sociology. Profes
sor Small is careful not to give read
ers the impression that it is easy to
understand the social process. He says
it is the most difficult problem in the
! field of positive knowledge. His claim
as to probable results Is that the best
that any man can accomplish will be
"merely a little better balancing of his
mind for social judgments than would
have been possible in his case without
the study." When we consider the far
reaching effects for good or 111 or even!
individual actions it will be appreciated
how much we need sociological knowl- |
edge in order to make those actions j
wise. One of the thoughts forcibly \u25a0
brought out by the work is that we can- j
not make ourselves truly .moral even
as individuals â cannot be reasonably j
sure of acting with kindness and fair
ness and thorough honesty toward our
fellow men unless we' prepare our- i
selves In wisdom to do it by some study i
of sociology. In the chapter on "The j
relation of the process conception qf
life to moral Judgments" it is. stated \
that the whole argument converges l
upon two propositions â First, every j
ethical system with a concrete content
virtually presupposes a sociology;
second, there can be no generally rec
ognized ethical standards until there Is
a generally accepted sociology.
In considering the question of the
profits of studying sociology we must
remember, as a Frenchman might put
it, there are sociologies â and sociolo
gies. In this conclusion Professor
Small expresses this little bit of/deli
cious ! critical feeling: "If fewer /would
call themselves sociologists, and if
more would absorb a very little of the
sociological spirit.", Here also he pro
duces this delightful epigram: "Wis
dom is Justified of her children, but she
is always compromised when the un
wise claim her maternity." I will,gtve
you one more chance to guess at the
wisdom of Professor Small's general
survey of sociology by closing with this
fragment from the chapter on "General
Survey": - .
"Selfishness is raised to a higher
power as it passes from the selfishness
of the self-centered individual into tho
selfishness successively of the members
of the .family, of the tribe, the com
munity," the state, the world-society,
and at last in some cases into fellow
ship with men still unborn, no less than
with the . present human family."

in that allotted time we could fully under
stand and get the good of all the artists
put upon their canvas. Take a single one
of these, for instance Rossetti's "Beata
Beatrix-âth e great poet-artist spent two
years, off and on; of thought and brush
work upon the symbolic thingâ and con
sider if 'we can be touched by a response
fractionally adequate to all the passion
he poured into its execution. Can- we do
it in two minutes, or shall we leave the
book openlat.tbe page "arid sitting on the
mantelpiece for a whole week?
. It is the memory of his dead j wife's
face that has had .a .modeling influence
upon his imagination in this, his ideal
of Dante's Beatrice. ,That wife whom
he loved and courted and adored for ten
long years, but whom love and ; death
allowed him to possess but .for ; a j brief
hundred weeks.
In the strict sense of the word it Is
hardly to be classed as * a portrait. In
another it is a portrait of two women in
one. It is the picture of Dante's Beatrice
as Rossetti Idealized her, and it is also a
portrait of Rossettl's wife as he Idealized
her into a spiritualized symbol of love it
self. It is said that the mysticism and
mystery of it I are due " to the Innermost
Rossetti, "or Rossetti of Rossetti." It calls
to mind:how,lt was that Rossetti's love
for his wife was the "inspiration of his
art. As for. the truenesg of the Beatrice
element in it: "The spirit of Dante never
found in art or otherwise an apter or
more subtle expression than this wonder
ful vision of that border realm which lies
between life and death." This woman in
the picture â so close to \ death â sees a vis
ion of the spiritual Beatrix, ."the celestial
love whose earthly, image was the Beatrix
the poet made immortal in immortal
verse." '\u25a0 ':" â¢ ,' â¢/" \u25a0- \u25a0\u25a0'\u25a0 \u25a0\u0084 "\u25a0 -
-- Another, portrait of much Interest is
that called "The Donna Velata," \ which
gives us the' features and' bust of the
unknown woman ' who was the love : " of
the great painter," Raphael. :. Julia Cart
wright, who describes this picture, I puts
up some valiant , ./words , of defense for
Raphael as f against the stories iof v the
master's excesses. '"> She says that Raphael
led a comparatively , blameless life that
was wholly devoted "to his art; and ab
sorbed In his work. The fambus*plctufe,
called ."The Fornarina," . which , was , long
supposed to be ' of .â¢ a â¢woman ,who H was
Raphael's; mistress,, is said by 4 this critic
to have had no further relation with Ra
phael than'to have' been a model who sat
to Raphael's ; scholars. So that 'puts; the

SEEKS A SOLUTION
OF DEEP PROBLEM
"Man's Rosponsibility," with the sub
title of "How. and Why, tho Almighty
Introduced Evil Ui>on the Earth," Is a
new, book' of twenty-three connected
essays by Thomas G. Carson, a phre
nologist. It is a bold and very thought
ful attempt by the author to solve for
himself , and for his readers that stu
pendous -i problem, the existence of
evil, which he acknowledges has stood
for solution: since the world began.
His hope that the great question wul
receive its solution in the page 3 of
his present book will probaby not be
realized; yet It may be that hU sug
gestions of" possible reasonable an
swers to the great query may give
some additional gleams of hope to
those who wish to see boneticence be
hind the veil.
The chapters cover such questions as
the first principles of creation; intro
duction of the evils of. violence; con
science, what it is and how It acts; de
pendence or conscience for Its proper
working upon the intellectual facul
ties; "man has been created. for pleas
ure, wit, ideality; an appreciation of
the science of phrenology; a sugges
tion- for the improvement of sbciety
and government
Chapter XIX is the one in which the
author., tackles most directly the prob
lem of why evil was introduced upon
the earth. He 'first takes under con
sideration moral evil, and deduces it
as a thing that must necessarily be as
a condition of freedom of the will. Un
less man be forced to act as a mere
puppet of the Croator, ho must be per
mitted to do -evil." So the Creator in
endowing . man. with the necessary
quallties ot life, such as combative
ness, acquisitiveness, self-esteem, con
structiveness, amativeness, wonder,
adhesiveness, faith, caution and so
forth, must leave it to the creature's
free will to keep himself in" balance as
to the virtues and the faults of these
qualities. Further, he puts forth this
claim: "For we cannot -shut our eyes
to the plain and palpable,, fact that
the Qreator, who saw the need from the
beginhlrr. did hot- create man for the
sole benefit- of any particular genera
tion or race, but with a great end in
"view," comprising all human time."
He admits that in the great designs
of nature the interests of Individuals
are not regarded, and the sufferings of
those who. are deformed of. mind or body
receive his, sympathy, without shaking his
faith in the beneficence of the power
which* permits 'the evil: : As he states It,
when: "a. principle-. is adopted it is in
flexible * and all the " consequences of* it.
however painful and sad. mu3t be ac
cepted." The \u25a0 book is a contribution to
optimism. The author's study of evil
only leads him to see a thread of wisdom
throughall that is mysterious and appal
ling itti/the world; * â¢
In the chapter on the appreciation of
the science of phrenology it does not ap
pear that he makes- out- a very good
case for the urging of the study of this
science of the mind. It would seem more
of v a curious - than a useful - study. To
admit. that thejvaflous mental and moral
Qualities of man Have correspondent di
visions of the brain -a 8 - sf ats of their
development and action. is easy., but the
author has not shown us In this book
how to put that admission, or knowledge,
to much practical use. The best value of
the volume is just as an expression of
exultant faith after a deeply thoughtful
consideration of the awful problem. Call
the work a contribution to optimism, and
take ; this as a "sample^ of its it
will.be a comfort both- to 'those who are
of the afflicted beyond earthly remedy
and to those who deeply sympathize with
their suffering:
For it appears to me certain, judging; from
the whole analogy of thÂ© works of the Crea
tor. > that these , suffering creatures are not
really more unfortunate than others, we are
considering, here tha works ot a Being of so
evident majesty and beneiicence that I can
only see In these things a conclusive argument
that lire does not end here, and that there U
yet a future, in which Injustices such as these
shall be redressed. The man that Impeaches
the act of the Creator here, must, as his baals
of attack, show that a future. life is actually

DIALECT STORY

Full of truth, suggestion and signifi

Alderman Casey," Just issued by the
Fennos of New York. The author.
Irene Stoddard . Capwel!. is the wife of
an' Episcopal clergyman, and it Is
doubtless In- the pursuit of her duties
as - a minister's wife that she - has
learned so well her Chicago./ It is one
of the few books written in pronounced

Few authors possess the faculties of
presenting correct dialect in correct

In ""Mrs. Alderman Casey',*, these two
elements of clever. writing are embod

SPLENDID EXAMPLE'
OF BOOKMAKER'S ART
Quite an elaborate example of the book
maker's art is "Sweeter Still Than This."
by Adah Louise Sutton. with Illustrations
by Carll B. Williams and decorations by
Ida May Rockwell. It is of the manufac
ture of the SaaUleld Publishing Company.
Akron, Ohio, and they .have taken great
pains with it, making every page a pic
ture. .Each word is done in artistic let
tering, and the margins, which are most
ample, are decorated with flowers and
cupW3 in delicate tints of gold and green
and pink and purple. The pictures are
full-page, and most of them are symbolic,
and a.ll the paper is of heavy and fine
quality.
meaning of the title Is to be found
in Byron'sâ
But tweeter still than this, than theÂ«e, than
all.
Is first and passionate love â it stands alone.
The text of the work consists of slmpla
verses, which appear to be the tribute of
a 'widow to a dead husband whom she
had. Intensely loved. It is dedicated "To
My Husband," arid its contents comprise:
"A Woman's Tribute." "Promise of
Spring," "Love, the Gift." M What the
Violin Said," "A Valentine." "Spring
Song." "Twilight," "Because," "Sanctu
ary," "The Coming of Love," "Credo."
"Dreams" and "Bud and Blossom." .
Here are some of the verses that arc
part of "A Woman's Tribute":
If God bad Riven me ths gift of a -rotca
Taat could charm, with the notes of a Lorelei.
I would sins and sing, till your own dear choica
Drew â¢ you to me alway.
If I could paint as the masters d<v.*>~; ; \u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0
With a wizard touch and a lifelike- grace.
Then would I paint, the whole, year through*
Pictures ol your dear face.

With fingers that rwayed the souls of men.
I would play till the heaven-born melodies
Led you back to me again.

LITERARY NOTES.
Ot all the renderings we have Rich
ard Le Gallienne's is by all odds tha
best adapted to give the English reader
an adequate idea of the poetry of Haflz.
He is not a Persian scholar, and hÂ«
confesses it. His version is based on
the translations of Clarke and Payne,
and. from them he has culled what
poems and dlstichs seem to him best
suited to form a homogeneous whole.
His work i 3 frankly not a translation
by a scholar, but a poet's version of
another poet.
The facile .touch .which distinguished
the author of "The Quest of the Golden
Girl" 13 ' ever present In his "Odes from
the, Divan of Haflz."
His verse is more than once too light
for the burning passion of the Persian.
Compare, for Instance, a favorite theme ,
of Iranian poets, the. praise of the Be
loved's hair, as Mr. Le Gallienne makes,
Hafiz speak.
Who shall interpret the Beloved* â¢ hair!
So subtly caught, and coiled, and garlandedâ
That maze, that glittering - net. that shining
snare;
Men of the true faith, and alike untrue. . *
Trapped in that cunning ambush on her head.'

from New York says:
"The clofce observer of financial operations
in Hall Â»tr*Â«t during the past week cannot
Jail to s*e the much manipulated and artificial
condition of the money situation recently, and
it was on this situation that we stroDgly ad
vised the purchase of tecuritles labt Monday
when loans were made at -5 per c*nt. A dras
tic attempt to liquidate all the weak holdings
la the market was quite wuccessfui and securi
ties fell into etrcng hards. There was no
business center in the United States where
money was not plentiful at normal rates tcr
this period of the year, and it has since Proven
that there Has been ample money in Wall
etreet for these in a position to get It. Bat
tlie public are not wanted in the market Just
yei. aÂ« there are deals to be consummated
which will require all the available funds by
bankers to corral necessary Etock to close these
operations For example. Mr. Hill is buying
tht control of M.. K. Â«.nd T. property for an
outlet to the Gulf of Mfxlco. These interests
have plenty of funds lor this purpose, and
money rates" are certainly not a factor. It Is
Â«*sy to surmise what the earnings of this prop
erty will be under Hill's regime, and it will
not be many year* when M., K. and T. com
mon will be telling at par. Its immediate
prospect* will undoubtedly carry this stock
\u25a0well abov* $60. Then there has been plenty
of money for certain Interests to acquire large
blocks of B. R. T. and the urgent buying at
timrs of this security makes us believe that
this property will paas to the Pennsylvania in
terests eventually and with, the further heavy
increases in earnings, which are positively as
sured, dividends are not a remote possibility.
THE METAL INTERESTS.
â¢â¢ * mercer of the iron properties Is In course
*f consumation aod will be an accomplished
fact In the not distant future. Republic Steel
and Iron and SchloÃs Sheffield stocks have all
Iwen heavily bought recently by banking
r.ouees who do the underwriting. Smelting
and copper Interests have had unlimited cash
to buy their specialties in large volume, and
the game may be said with regard to certain
railroad stocks. Hence we cannot look at the
money situation as being anything but
" healthy for this period of the year. Tre
mendous commercial activity will cause rates
to work within a radius of between 4}i and
fi per cent for the balance of the year, but It
must be understood that this factor will
not militate arair.st higher prices for stocks.
Russian internal disorders continue to men
ace cfTtan securities, and this situation 1Â§ re
flected here on fresh outbreaks asratnst the
Government. Howex'er, it must be remembered
that our bankers are in close touch with the
conditions there, sjid we doubt if matters were
as crave ac renorted to our- press, with the
possibility of a serious panic on the Paris and
Berlin bourse*, that our market would be al
lowed to show extreme buoyancy, as it would
only produce serious consequences on this side
of the water. However, it is well to follow
the foreign market? closely.
"Our bank reserves are film, but are going
to be better. Stocks have had a bit advance
this week and we advise caution in buying
until we have had a good reaction the coming
week."
XirfÂ«"d Frnit Market Strengthening:.
Late me.il reoorts from New Tork say:
"A decided improvement in .eenerai trade
during the oast week or ten days has Im
parted a stronger tone to the market and If
prices on the whole are no higher than a week
a*o there in no longer any disposition phown
to fihade cuotatlcns to move poods. The de
mand clowly reflects the actual present ne<Â»<ss
of conEuracUon. there being no speculative
buyine on a larce ncaJe, nor e\-en a disposi
tion to antlciDale requirements to an appre
ciable extent. On the coast the prune markK
1Â« decidedly Btrongpr and a 3%c f. o. b. basis
for 60s to SOs and a quarter of a cÂ«Â»nt premium
on 40s and 9<s now represents the views of
holder* sTenerp-lly. The Improvement on the
coast i* due to the decidedly Increased demand
from Eastern buyers of late, which 1c said to
have made considerable inroads on the com
paratively phort stock remaining on the coast.
Exporters also are said to be showing more
interest. In the spot market business has been
moderately actvt, though orders were malnly
for lots of 60 to 100 I* xc*. The demand runs
to 40s, supplies of which are light and some
holder* have advanced their quotation to 7'4c.
r#-porttiny sale* at that. Others, however, are
etill villlne to book orders at 7c. A fair de
mand for small lots of apricots and peaches
rr. the epot is rctcd and as supplies are very
light, with little available on the coast, ac
cording to general report, the market Is strong.
Fpot eeeded raisins are selling quite freely,
V though only in smll lots, the demand coming
% cliiofly from bujers who have goods on the
way to them from the coajit, but are tem
porarily short of stock. There is not much
' disposition shown to buy outside seeded raisins
for shipment from the coast and no sales
cf Association brands for forward shipment
are reported. Moet of the Independent coast
wedera are sold up, but some stock is still
offered at 7%c for fancy for prompt ship
ment Â«nd ~%c or poesibly 7c for all Novem
ber eh&roent. Valencia layers are In limited
supply on the spot and firm. Sultanas con
tinue in demand at full prices. Currants are
very firm and in demand. Persian dates are
celling freely. While there is no agreement
&mong Importer* to maintain Drices It was
etated on Saturday by those in a position to
know that there was not the slightest prospect
"â¢/Cf a decline from present price* during the
balance of the year. Smyrna figs are active,
strong and tending upward."

that receipts are much lighter, as will be seen.
The circular of Scctt & Magner says: ';\u25a0.. :\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0'
"The arrivals of Hay. for the wejck have been
2558 tons.' a comparatively moderate amount
for us ,to receive,' but under the. prevailing .
slow, demand it has been fully enough to sup
ply 'all ; our current needs. .;
â¢ ;"A larger part arrived by water, as the car
stringency. has not eased up a bit. and In fact
It appears to be more difficult to obtain cars
now than at any. time In the past.
\u25a0. "There has, .been,, no change to any extent
in : the range \u25a0. of prices. Choice ": offerings of
both Wheat and of ; Oat Hay have come in
very moderately, as cars could not be obtained
at the various points where these varieties arÂ«
stoted. All - other classes have moved off
slowly. - . -
"There has been a little uneasiness on ac
count of the want of rain. It. we do not have
some shortly - the market can be expected to
change for the better. Mu<jh__ Hay is being ;
fed at Interior points on account of the lack i
of green- feed, which necessarily will decrease
the stock of Hay. .
"An occasional car of fancy. Wheat Hay"
sells at $16 to $16 50. ; Outside of this, the
Wheat Hay arriving Is selling at from $9 to
Â§14 50. ' Choice tame Oat Hay brings $12 to
$12 50. - : . , â¢Â»..
"The shipping dtmand. has remained \u25a0 rather
quiet. .We usually expect - somewhat ' more
Hay: to be (moving in the export trade.
"Alfalfa Hay has advanced 6harply. The
fields ha\-e all been cleamd up. and what has

The Egg market continues meagerly supplied

demand. The public continue to nin on thÂ«

at" present. V
Tho Cheese market continues firm under the
good shipping demand and light stocks al
ready mentioned. Storage goods are higher.
Butter chows no change whatever. Stocks,
though not large, are sufficient for the demand.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
With : weather conditions operating against
trade, the fruit market was unusually quiet
for Saturday. Prices of most descriptions were
steady, however, because of continued light
receipts. Apples - were the ; best sellers In thÂ»
orchard line, but trade was confined almoat
entirely to fancy stock and prlcea for such
were â¢ well maintained. Most varieties of
Grapes in small packages continued to com
mand stiff prices and there was very littte
choice stock unsold at the close. Receipts of
large boxes were extremely light and prices
were largely nominal. Berries were lower all
around. Strawberries particularly being weak
under greatly increased recelpto. and a good
portion of the arrivals of large Berries from
the Watsonvllle region went to the carmen at
the Inside quotation. There was a good 'de
mand for well-colored Oranges, and Grape
Fruit, but there was very little Â«uch stock
offering.

EXPANDS TAHOE
FOREST RESERVE
(j oveninieiit Increases Pro
tected Area to further
the Work of Reclamation
Special DlspatcJV to The Call.
CALL, , BUREAU, , POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON, Nov. 18.â The recent ex-
pansion of>thc""Tatioe Forest Reserve, in
California^ to include various watersheds
of the American River! and also the
Tahoe and/* Truckee basins, in further
ance of the work of the United States
Reclamation Service of the,Truckee-Car
son project, has been followed by a fur
ther extension of the forest-reserve area
in that region to cover the portion of the
crest of the Sierra Nevada' Mountains ly
ing between the Tahoe and Plumas For
est Reserves.
This new reserve, which has been desig
nated the Yuba Forest Reserve, contains
a tract of 527,200 acres, varying in alti
ture .from" 2000 to 1000 feet, extending
well down-'from the crest *bf the moun
tains to the high foothills on the west and
to the Sierra Valley on the northeast. ; The
western , slope contains the . watersheds
of the north and middle forks . of the
Yuba River and the south fork of the
Feather. River, while the .eastern slope
is drained^ by the LJttle Truckee River,
flowing - toward the State . of Nevada.
The stream flow of this region, on
both sides of .the range, is of consld
able importance; in connection with irri
gation projects how under way by the
Reclamation Service, .as the drainage of
the Little Truckee River is mainly, de
pended upon :to supply two of the reser
voirs in the Truckee-Carson project,
known, as ,the L4ttle /Truckee Reservoir
No. 1 and the Henness Pass reservoir,
involving a r cost* of over, one hundred and
thirty thousand dollars, while some, of
the headwaters on' the western slope. are
looked to as, contributing streams in the
great Sacramento A r alley. project, ; which
has in. view the Irrigation of a large por
tion of the; Sacramento Valley. 7 / _
I In connection with this" latter project,
the. Reclamation Service has already, lo
cated and surveyed a number, of reservoir
sites on i the, coast streams, entering the
valley 'â¢â¢ from the west, arid the .Pitt
and Sacramento rivers, for the purpose
of storing ' the flood waters, and is now
engaged in making, surveys in the Feath
er River arid Putah Creek basins, where
reservoir sites are : known to exist; and
ln~; furtherance of/ ; the ' work, forest re
serves -are 'being 'extended, overcall \lm
pprtant '< as /rapidly as .pos
sible, /witha view to conserving and reg
ulating the stream . flow. g '
â¢ The. forest cover on the slopes included
within the | Tuba Reserve needs Zto be
specially j cared for, as fifes and lumber
ing, operations, in; the past; have reduced
the forested area, fully fifty-five per cent.
The management. of this reserve will, ac
cordingly.: be "particularly directed to
ward improving the forest, which, in ad
dition to .'regulating the waterflow.vis ]ot
importance in< connection -/with the rapid
ly Increasing - mining operations through
out that region.-
Unde.r protection, the en
tire tract will be devoted .'to' its" produc
tive use. and . every, effort will be made
to further all of: the "local/ Interests In

IS FAVORED
Engineers Reject
Lock-System
Canal
Tote Stands Eight; to
Five on the Finals
Ballot.
"Foreign Experts Unanimously
for Plan Advocated
by Majority.
WASHIXGTO.V, Xov. IS. â By a vote
6- 6 to S to-day, the board of consalttncr
engineers of the lathmlan Canal Com
mission, a body which. If President
noosrvelt realized his hopes, embodied
the crÂ«-atrÂ»t and moat representative
engineering: talent In the world, placed
ttaelf on record as favoring the con
\u25a0iruction of the Panama" canal on a
sea level.
This decision represents the outcome
of nearly three months' hard' work.
Early In September engineers gathered
from all parts of the world, for the
President, desirous of availing: of the
best talent as well as to avoid adverse
foreign criticism In the future, had
called on the governments of five great
nations, distinguished for the success
ful construction of great hydraulic
works, each to send one of its best
engineers to assist the American en
gineers In the. momentous problem- of
constructing the Panama canal at sea
level or at a greater a.titude involving
a system of locks.
The foreigners came to Washington
absolutely without Instructions from
their governments and without bias,
determined to be guided In their de
cision eolely by the facts to be ..pre
sented to them In the shape of a great
mass of physical data and supplemented '
lty several - projects, ' notably thaf upon ,
which the French Panama Company
worked. so patiently for more, than a
dicade; that of the first .American
Panama company, that of Buena-Va
rilla, the French engineer,, who was in
charge of the canal works in the last
days of the French administration, and
that of Lyndon Wi Bates, the Chicago
civil engineer, who was connected with
great enterprises on the Nile and else
where.
A3IERICA.VS FAVOR LOCK CABfAJU |
The Americana, for their part, were ac- i
oualated with the main part of these pro
jects before the board of engineer* met
In its first aosslon. They joined the study
of physical data with their foreign col
leagues, went over countless blue prints
end maps, want to the Isthmus and
scanned every Inch of the route of the
proposed canal and had made up their
minds when the board reconvened in
"Washington, at the beginning of this
month, as to the type of canal they fa
vored*
It was not until last Tuesday, however,
that anything in the nature of a decisive
votÂ« was | taken, and after all was an in
direct test. Just what that proposition
was cannot bÂ« stated .with absolute cer
tainty. but it Is conjectured that the Is
sue, wms whether or not a lock canal of
a certain type should be constructed.
At any rate, the vote disclosed that a
XB&jorlty of eight American members, un
der the leadership of General Abbott, was
strongly la favor of a lock canal. /The
foreigners were against the particular
type mentioned In the proposition,' but
It. was not dear that at that moment they
we opposed to the whole proposition of
s, lock on ft al.
The real test came to-day, and the
. meeting this morning was consumed . in
~ some very strong presentations on the
part of the majority of the American del
egates to lafluenoe their foreign colleagues
to accept one of the lock propositions.
ThÂ© Americans, however, were not unan
imous, tor there U reason, to believe that
i three of their number, probably General
V Davis, Parsons and Burr, joined the for
eign delegate* In this last yoU, which'
recorded the board as favoring the sea
level canal. v
FETAL DECISIOX WITH COXGIIESS.
The decision was reached at noon, and
thereby the board practically concluded
Its labors. There will be a few more
meetings next week, simply to deal. with
emajl details and to put into permanent
tonn the results of the board's' protracted
meetings. The foreign delegates desire
to leave for their homes by the 27th \u25a0 in
tjtant. To accommodate them in this the
full board has agreed that they may-con
clude some purely formal work connect
ed with this project, such as the approval
of certain -minutes and signing ; of; paipers,
at a special meeting to be held in Paris
In December or January. It Is expected
that one of ; the American:, members *of
the board) will go to. Paris to wind, up
this business, all of which must be done
before the final report of. the board' can
be regarded as complete and ready, for
submission to the Isthmian i Canal ' Com
mission. The commission in turn "must
record .. ltÂ« - own Judgment on? the" condu- J
slons reached by the board <of engineers
and there is even now a belief - current
that that Judgment will be adverse to
the board's plan. â¢ : ' T
However, there are two more important
steps, at which, there may be' important
changes proposed, for the commission
must pass , the plans and Its own recom
mendations to the President; ' who.-V- In
turn, must stamp them . with ' his own ap-
t ' proval * or; disapproval : and - forward < them
's % to Congress. The ; latter ] body, af ter 7 all,
*t*Â»Â»jwlll â¢be the . court of ; last ; resort^as " be
** tween the , sea level . and i lock ,' canal pro-^
jects, simply through the 'fact that; ad
ditional \u25a0 legislation will \u25a0be 'necessary:- IT
a. sea, level . canal is to be built. -, The
board finds that such a 'canal will' cost
from 175,000,000 to $100,000,000 more than the

HEAKST'S LAWYERS"
TO GO INTO COURT
Will Make an Effort Monday
to Have the Ballot
Boxes Opened.
NEW YORK, Nov. Id. â The counting
of so-called void and protested ballots
In the First Assembly District of Man
hattan was completed before Justice
Ueigcrich in the Supreme Court to-day
and as a result both the McCle.'ian and
Hearst lawyers who were present claim
alight grains. It was impossible to ar
rive at the exact result because it is
not known how many of the ballots
had been counted by the election in
fc'pcctors November 7. One of tne law
yers representing Mayor McCleilan said
the Mayor had gained 10 votes, while a
Hearst attorney claimed a gain of 12.
Kach claim is disputed.
It was said by members of the Tam
many Hall law committee to-night that
the canvasses of the general returns in
one-iifth of the entire city showed a net
Cain for Hearst of 150 votes, and that
if this rate was maintained the plurality
of 3000 given McCleilan would be reduced
by only a few hundred votes.
It is understood that the Hearst man
agers will go Into court Monday In an
effort to have the ballot boxes opened.
Justice Geljrerlch sat for two hours to
day examining ballots which had been
returned as void or protested in the First
Assembly District. Many of the ballots
â¢were subjected to an examination by a
magnifying glass and over each there was
a contest. The examination will continue
next week.

The King's sympathies, it is said, are en
tirely with the, poor in this matter,- and,
privately, his Majesty Is doing his utmost
to alleviate their condition. But he can
accomplish little in that way. The work

of the women's; movement. She planned
the., monster >,procession 'of women to
Buckingham Palace -to present a petition :
to the King asking 'him to summon a spe-j
clal seesion of Parliament. The King pre
viously stated, through ; his .private secre

ceive such a deputation, as it [would be
contrary to precedent, and â¢ that the . petl-j
tion should be sent ; to ', his "responsible

ST. PETERSBURG. Nov.- 18.â It is re

a general zemstvo and local municipal
government to Poland may be issued.
Bhortly.
The Emperor yesterday "" received at
Tsarskoe-Selo a deputation of clergymen
from the Holy | Synod and \u25a0'. joined with
them in' prayers for the restoration of
peace and tranquillity'of Russia, the ap
peasement of class hatreds and the estab
lishment of mutual relations of love and
confidence between all the citizens of the
empire. The ceremony was impressive.
The archbishop, bishop and priests, in
the gorgeous, cloth-of-gold vestments of
the Russian church, headed by the Metro
politan, went in procession to the recep
tion hall of the Alexander Palace, chant
ing prayers for the welfare of the Em
peror and the safety of the imperial
house. The Metropolitan, Antonius, in
his address, thanked his Majesty in be
half of the clergy for the imperial reform
manifesto, the great historical importance
of which they recognized, and' then
prayed the Lord to give the country
peace and to help all the faithful subjects
of his Majesty, "calmly and wisely, to
accept the benefits granted them, and to
turn their hearts from" 'the: spirit 'of vio
lence and riot, which was destructive of
all liberty. -
The Metropolitan formally blessed the
Emperor with a sacred ."ikon, /which his
Majesty devoutly kissed and expressed
his gratitude for the blessing. He said:
"Together with you and the whole Rus
sian nation I constantly pray the Lord
to pacify the Russian people, and send
them piety and faith. I strongly desire
all the clergy, especially the villago
priests, to exercise sincere. Christian zeal
toward the restoration of peace among
their congregations and to faithfully per
form their duties." "\u25a0 _ 7

ST. PETERSBURG, "Nov. 18.âTwen

met a committee of Social! Democrats
at an aristocratiCT residence .on . the
English quay last night and informed
the committee of the progress \u25a0 being
made by the revolutionary, sentiment
among the troops.' While many officers
and men are siding /with the proletar

none of the regiments were yet ready
to openly \ desert the Government in ; a
body in the event of a conflict.
Dispatches received here from Penza
give only a confused .account of : the
Agrarian disorders: in that province,
where a false Emperor is said to have
appeared. The reports from Penza
mention the existence of a false Em

the number of his followers, which
evidently was largely overestimated.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
\u0084SEATTLE,. SEATTLE, Nov. ; 18.â Because- the res
olution committee had on hand a mass of
work handed In during the morning
which it would "-'be impossible ' to . report
upon â¢ before * the'; end of 'the'- day, . the
Alaska convention' after a half hour ses
sion this ; morning adjourned until Mon
day morningat 10 /.o'clock. the
session the following resolution was pre
sented and carried unanimously, and af
ter being signed, by" Chairman A. P.
Swineford and. Secretary W. S. McKean,
was \u25a0 telegraphed to \u25a0 the President at
Washington tby J. G. Price, chairman of
the committee on resolutions: . .
"The Alaska, Territorial convention,
permanently organized and assembled
here, and representing all parts of Alas
ka, sends to you as its first official. act
a unanimous vote of thanks for your
help and for your recommendations in
your message to â¢ Congress of December
B, 1904. "We earnestly request you to re
iterate to the Congress , about to assemble
Alaska's needs pending the granting of
local self-government, which the . people
of Alaska demand. A. full report of the
proceedings of this convention wfll be
transmitted to you and to Congress upon
our. adjournment."
\u25a0 r On . Monday, morning It is expected the
resolution \u25a0committee will report back to
the convention a memorial to Congress,
fathered by Governor Swinef ord,' de
manding that legislation be enacted giv
ing Alaska a Territorial form of govern
ment. It is believed tuch'a report will
precipitate a bitter fight, based on the
â¢grounds thafthe'dlstrict'ls not ready for
such Congressional action which, if given,
will result in taxation* larger than the
residents can bear. It is pointed out by
a good share of the delegates, although
they are believed to be in the minority,
that a Territorial form of ; government
means local government throughout the
vast district. It means that elections
must be held ; necessitating the traveling
of great distances and the creation of
many political offices, the aggregate cost
of which- will exceed the amount the
district now' pays Into the national treas
ury \u25a0 for \u25a0 district government. The ; pro
faction argues that not until local gov
ernment is given Alaska will the various
parts be united together in a bond which
will result in the rapid 'upbuilding of
the whole country. "â¢;.â¢â¢;
. This fight promises .to exceed , in In
tensity that over, the delegate -Question
which, while smtldering^Jias quieted
'down. \u25a0 However, \ the general belief Is
that. the Territorial resolution will carry
by a small majority.
A. new .phase has entered Jnto the dele^
gate fight. : Both RyanTaiN}'' Johanson
claim enough .votes t&- secure, election and
as : many of the delegates -navr-tn'a'ttena
ance will have to leave In a few' days
for; the East ' and '; Soutbuthe , situation is
liable to change.at any, time. Just so
long as. there Is a. chance of electing
Ryan : the Nome delegation, faithful to
the candidate from that district, will re
fuse â¢to entertain the Idea suggested ;by
the i "order Lv of . business committee that
three delegates to "Washington be named.
: The ' Southeastern ; delegates . do not
know where- they stand on^the delegate
question If the convention decides to elect
three. In ithe first place but onÂ© . name,
that of former Governor Swlnef ord, has
been mentioned for the position from' the
southeastern section. Swlneford,' while
recognized by all as.v a \u25a0 brainy man and,
owing to his past executive position, one
well versed ' in' the needs of the district,
is not satisfactory to a majority of the
delegation. .To add to " this condition
there is apparently not another man in
Southeastern Alaska who is willing to
accept the .. Job. ; Therefore this part of
Alaska , would - rather see : the fight - be
tween" Ryan and Johanson carried to a
finish.
Intense indignation Is rampant among
all the delegates at? what some one con
sidered V would â¢be> a* Joke. A " few ' days
ago an order was â¢ placed . with . a local
firm for elaborate badges. These were
delivered late last night. When the
package . was opened. It , was found that
the back of the â¢ badges < had been faced
with black satin on , .which was . printed,
"In Â« memoriam, first /Alaska convention,
Seattle," Nov. , 15, 1905.", ; .Who gave the or
der :>: to Â£ put \u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0 this ; on ; cannot ;be learned.
The 'committee' that placed; the order for
the : badges declare ; nothing of the . sort
was \u25a0 mentioned when: the i order, 'wa*
placed.-. The manufacturer says he *- re^
ceived \u25a0 the .order ; over ' the telephone; the
speaker giving the name of the chairman
of the committee.' The bill for the
badges is ; about : $200, aad It Is hung up
in â¢ conÃequence. It ;has- been suggested
that the black satin -be ripped off, t but
the " convention ' appears not to .want
badges arid the package Is not being dis
tributed. '..' ' "HHEMttHM
\u25a0'When' the resolutions .committee '\u25a0'. ad
journed to-night It had considered seventy
recommendations, i and over, thirty; more
will â¢ be taken ; up at a session to-morrow.
Of this ' number only- a " small share .will
be presented ito "the -convention, among
which are the. following:':, 5
- Memorial" to Congress declaring for Territo
rial form 'of government. . Resolution declaring
for:- more lighthouses, ln Alaska. Resolution

FACTS ABOUT WHITMAN
lieiniiiiscences of the Late
Literary Giants of the
United States Are Related
Special Dieratch to i'he Call.
LONDON, Nov. 18.â ThÂ«rÂ« is a former
citizen of the United States living in re
tirement at Aberdeen who has some fas
cinating memories of Edgar Allan Poe,
and uncommonly Interesting recollections
of Walt Whitman, Longfellow and other
American literary giants of the past.
When interviewed the other day by a rep
resentative of Dr. Robertson Nicoll's
Britiili Weekiy he ask<d to have his
name withheld, but the reminiscences
which be gave of the golden age of
American literature are well worth quot
ing.
A Harvard man. this veteran's youth
teas spent In Brooklyn, New York, where
his father's house seems to have been a
great resort of the most famous Ameri
can writers of their day. Poe especially
was not only a regular visitor, but on
vuch terms of intimacy with the family
that he was In the habit of dropping in
at all sorts of unexpected times. And it
Is rather pleasant to hear that frequent
as were his visits, these friends never
caw him In a condition which raised even
the faintest suspicion of overindulgence,
even at the time when his habits were
tnost Irregular.
Seen from the eyes of a boy of seven,
as the British Weekly's Informant then
Â«\u25a0Â»Â», Poe proved an unusually attractive
figure.
RECITATIONS BY AUTHOR.
"I always went to him." he says, "with
the utmost confidence, and I have most
vivid recollections of going and looking
up into his face and pleading, 'Mr. foe,
will you oblige mÂ« by reciting "The
Rav#n?" ' Never once did ne refuse, and
many and many a time I heard 'The
Raven' declaimed by its author in a man.
ner possible to the author alone. Lean
ing against his chair, or, perhaps, oftener,
sitting on his knees. I was able not only
to catch the very tones of his voice, but
to note the changing moods as reflected
on his expressive face. The impression
remains with me to-day. It was the most
weird experience one could imagine. Poe
had a very melodious voice which, when
be wished, bad a considerable amount of
resonance. He would begin, andâ but I
can't describe his elocution.
"He wrote the poem, and, as he recited
it, he seemed to be giving to every line
the shade of meaning it had in his own
imagination when he had first conceived
it. He carried you along with him from
first to last as he worked steadily toward
the climax. His voice took many a strange
inflection of tone, especially at the close
of each verse. 'Nevermore,' as he uttered
It, was a word full of deep meaning. Now
it was said as if. in interrogation, again
in Indignant anger, and yet again in a
croaking whisper. At the close of the
verse next to the. last he shrieked the
'Nevermore,' and there followed a strik
ing pause. Beginning the last verse his
\u0084 \-oice got lower and lower, until at the
last it was almost inaudible. As he ut
ttrtd.in .a soft, weird voice the lines.
And rr.y eoul from out that ehadow that llea
floating on the floor
fchall be lifted â never more,
he seemed to be oblivious to all his
surroundings. His deep-set, dark eyes
were fixed on the floor, and after he con
cluded the poem he sat motionless and
speechless for some minutes, gazing tm
with rapt vision on something unseen to
others. The effect, more particularly as
he heaved a deep-drawn sigh at the close,
was indescribable."
WHITALLVS BEARING.
Walt Whitman this former Brooklyn
boy knew intimately at a period some
years later. Whitman had then publish
ed several of his works and held an ap
pointment in the New York Custom
house.
"As he came sauntering along," gays
the man In Question, "his leonine figure at
once arrested attention. He walked in a
careless devil-may-care manner, but with
out any swagger, his bare breast, heavily
matted with hair, fully exposed alike in
summer and winter. Most striking of all,
however, was the faraway look in his
eyes. He was always guzlng up, never
down, and If he bad met his own brother
in the street he would never have seen
him. It was certainly not a vacuous ex
pression, but. rather, an engaged and
preoccupied one. This characteristic was
likewise apparent in company. Even in
a bohemian club, much frequented by lit
erary men. be was never lively or Jocu
lar, but more of a contemplative mood,
and would sometimes sit for an hour
without speaking."
'Of Longfellow's characteristics, this
speaker remembers most vividly his
grand, handsome personal appearance.
"With his flowing hair and full beard,"
he says, "the great poet bore a strong
resemblance to some of the old pictures
of Moses in Continental cathedrals. He
was very simple in his manners and in
society was rather reserved, and some
what shy."
He knew Hawthorne, too, but was not
greatly attracted by him.
"Nathaniel Hawthorne." he declares,
"had nothing to say to anybody that I
can remember. He was either proud or
very diffident. I never met Emerson but
once, and he did not impress me favor
ably. He could be sarcastic, and perhaps
unpleasant, and some of his remarks were
extremely caustic."
Lowell he describes as "apt to carry

Breclal Dispatch to TbÂ» Call.
PARIS, Nov. ,; 18.â Because he failed
to obey : his : wife's orders to commit
hara-kari, Henry, Nogues Is now lodged
In jail, accused by ; her of committing
burglary, forgery andi'a variety of
other heinous offenses. All' the same
Nogues thinks that the l laugh Is on his
side and Paris agrees with. him. _
No*ues \u25a0 la an expert maohmev fitter
and a practical philosopher. Whether
he is the other things whloh his wife
alleges remain* to be proved- by that
lady, who keeps a greenjrrocoxT Â»hop
In the Rue d'Allematrne., , .
\u25a0 Madame Nogues Is a woman of
' thrifty . habits but shrewish > temper.'
She and her husband did not get along
well together and he rejoiced when his
.work took him away f rom home | for* a
few daya;. He was engaged on a job
at Rennes the other day and congratu
lating himself on his temporary release
from domestic worries/ when "he re
ceived this exhilarating epistle from his
better half:
"Inhuman monster I You have
brought disgrace and hishonor on your,
family. If you do not commit suicide
within twenty-four hours I shall de
nounce you 'to the police. -: * \ Â»
Any ordinary man would* have been
greatly depressed by such a missive,
but it did not upset Nogues : a bit. : He
does not seem to have ; denied . the
charges, but 'wrote his wife "that he
was prepared to commit suicide. To
save her the" 1 necessity of having to at
tend to such disagreeable details her
self, however, he begged that she would
send him sufficient . money to enable
him to make provisions j for his decent
burial. He : besoughther also to send
him a photograph of herself and ; his
two daughters that they might \be
placed in the coffin with him. He con r ,
eluded by pleading | for her forgiveness
and subscribed himself, ' "Your affec
tionate husband." . , ..
BATS FAREWELL DINNER.
Nogues' fellow workmen noticed that
he was in a particularly good humor
for vie rest of the day, for he chuckled
frequently to himself, but, he declined
to tell them what . it was that had
tickled his fancy so; muoh. Mme.
Nogues was delighted .with the letter,
but she wouldn't risk \u25a0 her precious
money on her . husband's ~ mere word.
Instead of sending it ; to, him by â¢ mail
she intrusted it to her. brother-in-law,.
Legris Benonie, and instructed him to
see that Nogues, carried out his part
of the bargain anditof send. Her a .tele
gram '\u25a0 when the job .;was\dpne.--'-- She
gave him $120, ha- ing ' figured it out
that that amount would- enable her
husband to blow his brains out decent
ly and pay for the . funeral | expenses.
And she , considered ; that ; she '\u25a0 would be
getting rid of him, cheaply at the price.
Nogues had' not calculated : on Legria
taking any part "In] the* affair, but he
readily adapted himself to 'the changed
circumstances. When |_ Legris j had ex
plained-his mission Nogues professed to
be; well satisfied with the^arrangenient;
and they went off ', together : to. buy, a
revolver. - \u25a0; .:â¢-'-'. ;\u25a0\u25a0'\u25a0. ,' -'â¢â¢.: " \u25a0
' After'the weapon had been purchased,
Nogues proposed that they should eat'
a farewell dinner and - crack' a couple
of bottles of wine together, before he
made his exit from, this world. .
"You can cut' down : the; funeral, ex
penses a bit to make .up. for what it
costs," he suggested,'. "and ? Anna âshe Is
a dear, good wife,' buta, bit close-fisted
â need never, know that. we had a good
time with the money."
HIS DEATH ANTICIPATED.
Legrls acquiesced ; without demur and
they adjourned 'to the" hotel' -where
Nogues was 'staying: \u25a0â¢''â¢ There" they did
full 'â¢ justice *to !an" ample V dinner:.- ' : \u25a0
"The landlord has treated me so well
here," said Nogues when It was finished,

Says,4n Time of War the
"Service Would Be Ciippled
WASHINGTON, Nov. 18.â "The army Is
under T offlcered," says Lieutenant Gen
eral Adna'R. Chaff ee, chief .of staff, -In

the army ; In peace and '_ in "time of war
it "r would "be 'In a crippled condition."
There/ are 167 officers absent on detailed
duty, and General Chaffee thinks that
provision should be made to fill these va
cancies' caused by details which are per
manent in character.
General Chaffee discusses N the . deser
tions in the army and makes the fol
lowing" suggestions: <
"Some: suitable legislation affecting the
political' rights ot deserters,- and an
aroused public opinion that desertion
from the military service of the nation
Is repugnant in tho minds of all good
citizens, constitute ; the practical method
and the only effectual means In my opin
ion for the material abatement of the
crime referred, to." ;
He says the .wisdom of the creation of
the general staff has been abundantly
demonstrated. \u25a0 In --' the ; first , division. In
addition to a vast amount of other work,
elaborate I data .has been collected as ' to
the number, of . vessels procurable for use
as transports -at \u25a0- the various ; seaports "of
the Atlantic ;; and â¢ Gulf " coasts and the
number of troops they will accommodate,
the camping and storage facilities at the

the side . and 'rolling ' stock available.
The second division : has been "* engaged

PARIS, Nov. 18. â The Paris police are
to be .taught Jiu-jitsu. : Six Inspectors

In this scientific art of self-defense, and
in their turn they will teacn other

Moquin. head of one of the detective

means of. defense for, the, police.: Since
I have been at the head of the brigade
dcs recherches I have been asked . fre
quently to have my men taught boxing,
but I constantly refused, because there

"Jiu-jitsu Is the art . of Â«Â«1 1 -defense.
It enables our detectives to master the

that the evildoers and Apaches of Paris
are studying Jlu-Jltsu, . but . the police.
I am convinced, will prove more than
equal to them.''

includes many rich antique drinking
cups, one of \rhlch . has imbedded in
its rim an: ivory medallion ! given to
the first Duke of Ormonde by^harlQ3
I. By.it hangs a romantic' story, which
is known as the "Ormonde love story."
Its herp | was James, the 19-year-old
son of the -widowed Lady Thurles. Lord
Thurles,' eldest son of .the .: Earl of
Ormonde, had been drowned Incrdsslng
the Irish Sea. and his widow, with her
three young sons, hud a hard "strug
gle with ' fortune. Her father-in-law,
the eleventh Earl, had had the mis
fortune to: offend King James I, and
was almost as poor as herself.
Her son James was \ handsome and
debonair, and poverty troubled him
Dut little until he fell head over ears
in love with his beautiful j cousin, % the
Lady Elizabeth | Preston. â¢ She was jj an
only child, a Baroness in her own right
as a bride, so they said, quite out of
reach of the penniless James. But jto
make matters quite safe she was
packed off to London, where, lodged at
Holland; House.; she- was able to
see the world and make a match worthy
of her rank and herpurtse.
To Holland V> House one morninsj
came a' peddler, with; laces in his pack
and wiles upon his tongue. The daugh
.ters.of the Earl* of \ Holland were cap
tivated by the lace 'and by its vender.
They ran toe the } Lady Elizabeth, who
was moping above in herchamber, bid
ding her \to come :to ;the .back door,
where was the handsomest peddler that
ever -was* seen.. . " ' : â¢ '. : .
. Some, Inkling of, the truth may have
dawned on. the : Lady Elizabeth, for
Irish maidens are .as quick wittediai*
they are lovely.. '.'Beholding at -the
back . door." : runs ' the . chronicle, "the
merchant and his .wares, she fain, would
buy of: him certain) silken" gloves; :of
which j- she had ; had the handling.; The
ladies '' riolland offered . to lend - her the
money wherewith j to 1 , complete the pur
chase, , but ; fihe,;,uhheedf ul, retired: into
her chamber to fetch' her some. Being
private^- she i drew from- the gloves > a
letter, which she perused and wrote*, the
answerâ all In'; the shortest space. Fur
thermore, the gloves j proved "a 1 misfit
and; had" to be: returned, to" the'peddler.

NEW YORK, Nov. 1 8.â Prices were

bank statement showed a surplus of
12,915,150 above the i's per' cent legal

siocks developed . some" hesitation, and
the closing tone was | decidedly Irreg
ular, with many .prominent; stocks
showing: | small net losses \u0084 from last
night, while the conspicuous specialties
held some very; striking gains. While
the bank* statement showed the restor
ation of a surplus, the manner In which
it: was accomplished. a& indicated by
the .changes Jin the various .'items,
aroused some questioning over the out
look. The cash Item showed a decline
of nearly: $2,000,000. which is account
ed for approximately by. the known
movements of ;muney, but show prac
tically no beneilt- from this supposed
private transfer of large sums to the
banks at this center from Canada and
other sources. The improvement in
the bank situation la almost entirely
due to the enormous cut. of $27,204,200
in the loan item of the banks. On Sep
tember 9 of this year the banks report
ed a "\u25a0\u25a0 decrease Ifi loans of t30.237.300.
which is the record figure, and on Octo

In All Outdoor Sports
He Is Regarded as
an Experts
Bpcetal IMtpstoh to TbÂ« Call.
LONDON, Not. 18.â Though the bow
has long ceased to be anything more
than a weapoxv- to play with, archery
still has many devotees In England, and
most enthusiastic among them is the
Earl of Aylesford. Of all his titles he
is proudest of that of "Lord Warden of
the Woodsmen of Arden,", a society of
archers more ancient than any in the
kingdom with the exception of that of
the Royal Company of Archers. Re
cently he presided over its annual com
petitions, which are always held in the
beautiful grounds of his own estate,
Parklngton Park, that In the old days
formed part of Shakespeare's "Forest
of Arden." Once every three years a
contest takes place between the Arden
archers and their Scottish rivals.
Lord Aylesford is 64 years old, but
standing well over six â¢ feet, of spare
frame and straight as one of his own
cloth-yard arrows, he looks all of ten
years younger. He is an authority on
all kinds of outdoor sports, is an ex
cellent shot, a good billiard player and
a cheerful and most popular' companion.
Among his friends he goes by the fa
miliar name of "Charlie." " Owning 20,
000 acres of land, he has never experi
enced any difficulty in solving the prob
lem of how to be happy without work.
His country residence, Packlngton Hall,
is full of sporting relics â weapons from
all over the worldâ -stuffed specimens
of rare birds and beasts, and fine old
prints of sporting subjects. His sport
ing proclivities are happily shared .by
his wife, Lady Aylesford. She Is de
voted to dogs, and of ohows especially
she ranks as the best Judge in England
and in that capacity is often, seen at
dog shows. ..."

EMBEZZLEMENT CASE AGAINST .
: BALLINGER IS DISMISSED
After .Two Trials, When _ Juries Dls
aKreed,' District Attorney Thinks
Conviction Impossible. 'â¢' : .
â¢; When the case of George T. Ballin
ger, charged with felony embezzle
ment, was called : in Judge \u25a0 Dunne's
court yesterday to be , again 6et for
trial, the District Attorney made a mo
tion that It be dismissed, explaining
that the defendant had already been
tried twice and he did not think a con
viction possible. The ..motion waa
granted. \ -
Ballinger was employed as book
keeper' for the Calif ornia * Art Glass
Bending and Cutting Works, 120 Sec
ond street,' and wa3 accused of em
bezzllng,';between December 31, 1902,
and March: 1, 1903, the sum of $281 45.
Shortly after the information was filed
against him he was released on a writ
of habeas corpus by Judge Graham,
but Judge Dunne refused to strike the
case from his calendar and Insisted
upon Its going to trial. Two trials
were held, one before Judge Hart of
Sacramento, the other , before Judge
Doollng.'of - San Benito County, and at
each trial the, jury disagreed.
; Ballinger was a captain of the First
California Regiment when that com
mand went to Manila at the time of the
Spanish-American War.

heavy storm struck the Washing

started southward. Professor McAdlo
\u25a0aid San Francisco would get a. brash
from the tail of the rain clouds to-day
unless something should shoo them oft
along the northern shore. The weather
was considerably cooler last evening.
Hard rama may be expected at any
time now that the area of high pressure
has disappeared.
The slight rain of Thursday night
was hardly sufficient to wet the streets
and yesterday morning the sky was as
clear as ever. , San Francisco has been
without a real bath for 135 days.

THE WEEKLY CALL
Si per Year.
ENGLISH ACTOR
TO BE KNIGHTED
Speculation Rife as to the
Player on Whom the Honor
Is Destined to Descend
SEVERAL CANDIDATES
John Hare, Beerbohm Tree,
F. R. Benson, Also George
Alexander, Are Mentioned
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Nov. 16. â There Is a rather
definite understanding throughout the
theatrical profession that an actor will
be among the recipients of knighthoods
this year. There haa been no official
pronouncement oh the- subject, of
course (there never. le), but the report
has gained such wide currency that
there is undoubtedly something in It.
And, of course, .speculation as. to who
the new theatrical knight will be is
keen. \u25a0 .
Offhand, one would cay that it prob
ably lay between John Hare and Beer*
bohm Tree, but there are rumors that
a surprise is in store. These appoint
ments are made, not by tbe King, but
the Government, and after such a
choice as that of Alfred Austen aa poet
laureate it is difficult to say what will
happen. On the other hand, tbe actors
knighted thus far have been eminently
worthy of this honor. There have been
only three â Irvine:. Sir Squire Bancroft
and Sir Charles Wyndhamâ and in each
case the service rendered - to the stage
was unquestionable. Wynd Ham's rec
ord is, of course, too well known to
Americans to. need recalling, and al
though it Is now almost a decade since
Sir Squire Bancroft retired the repu
tation he gained as manager of the
London "Hay market" has suffered no
diminution.
John Hare is In every respect worthy
of a knighthood; Beerbohm Tree has
certainly worked .hard to get one. ; He
has made a lot of notable Shakespear
ean productions, has given no end of
charitable performances and has found
ed a school for acting that seems to be
turning out some promising material.
Then there is George Alexander, who
made a really plucky and probably dis
interested attempt a while ago to en
courage the "native drama," but "had
to give it up because he didn't cover
expenses. This actor-manager private
ly considers that ' "Sir ' Geprge Alexan
der" would sound uncommonly well. !
BE.\SO.\ MAY WIX HONOR.
The hint of a surprise appointment,
however, makes one believe the new
"Sir" will be added, not to any of the
names mentioned, but to that of F. R
Benson. And on second thought the
thing would not be surprising at all,
but about the most worthy, if not the
most popular that could be made. Tc
many Americans this actor-manager's
rame probably will .be unknown, but
here' it is synonymous with art tor art's
sake â the art of the player.
Benson" is the proprietor "of what :iE
undoubtedly -the- best repertoire com
pany In England at the present -time.
He isn't a popular favorite in London,
for . the reason that he sticks closely
to the classics â Shakespeare, Sheridan
and the Greeks, but chiefly Shakes
peare â and London doesn^t \u25a0 care, for
classical productions,, unless* they 'are so
smothered in ".'stage effects^ and' domi
nated by "stars" as to frustrate com
pletely the author's Intentions^ . v
Benson's revivals are'^adequately
staged and no - more. His-,' company,
which has been in existence , fifteen
years or morei. plays weekly vengage
ments throughout the prqvjn^esâ with
brief visits â¢ .to > London â and^'tbe man
ager's conscientiousness and the fact
that there is,aohange of ; bill, nightly
b^ave combined to produce one of the
best practical training schools for ac
tors in the world... . . -v- .-."- *. ,â'
,-Half the actors and actresses.' who
have made really big successes' in Lon
don during the last live years have been
Benson- graduates. They Include Oscar

\u25a0Xy' Ain*ley 'and Lena , "Ash well, : to- name
only 'the' first 1 that come^tbrmlri'd. ;It

"willing,".;-. Benson And. his, company
have been . "cno sen regularly ' to \ play
Shakespeare's pieces v at! the'-amnial

.; It w&s\ demonstrated afresh in a .-_ spe
cial, matinee at His Majesty's. this week
that ''lbusn's "An En,emy/ of the people"
is better suited to the English-speaking
public : than .most .of Ibseu's . wor k-f-that
it is, ln fact, an uncommpnly !^p}ayabie",
play, with action and interest 'â¢ that
never flag for a moment until -the Itfsf

Beerbohm Tree welL . too," arid it .was
evident enough that* the audience^ wad
delighted with the perfpr'manccnot beJ
cause it was considered,. aVsmaft, thing
to applaud Ibsen, but because ."An ; En4
emy of the People," done with, intelll-i
gence and enthusiasm,' Is genuinely/en-*
tertalning. ' It Is probable. 'â¢that- the;
play will be put on for 1 a run at some

ou Friday afternoon in an unconscious
condiUoa and an hour later was" re

that night, i The i>od>- wa*. removed to
tlie Morgue x yesterday, where the au
topsy showed thac he died rrom,a frac

Murray went to the lo6g ing-house at
â¬07 California atreet last Tuesday. He
was Â«lck ana Aleck Henderson, the
day clerk. caUed in Policeman D. J.
Jieohaae. who ajskod him what -was the
matter with him and Murray replied
that he was hurt on hi* head.- The
following day he told- Henderson he

drink. He had &n altercation .with a
"bull." meaning a; policeman, whom he
did not know. anÂ£ the policeman hit
him on the back \of his head -with a
club.
Henderson did not think it J worth
while to notify the -.police about Mur
ray's statement, nor did he ask him
Jn what part of the city he had- the
altercation with the 'policeman. Mur
ray was without funfls and Henderson
told Detective Colema^i. who had been
detailed on the case, tbat he paid for
Murray's room rent on Thursday and
Friday out of his own pocket. ,It was
Henderson who had Murray sent to
the Central- Emergency ; Hospital.
Murray was a yoi^ng man and .when
he registered at 607*. California street
he simply: gave the 'tfiajne of . Murray,
without a Christian .rtaaie. When he

BARBARY COAST
Enraged Amazon Starts Reign; of Terror
That Paralyzes Pacific Street. / : !
Leaves Scores of Battered Victims -in
(theiEath. of Her Raid. .' ;â¢. '.. ;':
As Policeman Skein wended his, way
toward .Pacific -street Friday- .â night, he
heard - a noise like St. Petersburg: on
Saturday night. As he hurried down the
firing line, he stumbled across a prostrate
body." ' -: ,
"What's the, matter?" asked Skein.
"Alice," moaned the wounded man,
"she just ' went by." - -.- ;\u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0 Â«.-â¢â¢\u25a0'
Policeman " SkeJnP 1 accelerated his pace
and stepped up.on,the stomach of another
victim, of the : massacre. ;. --f,
"Spare .me' Alice.','- pleaded'the prostrate
figure.: \"I \u25a0surrender.". ,?\u25a0;...;â¢.:. â¢
All along the street were "writhing cas
ualties left by the raid.* J Farther on : men
and women were, fleeing In terror. Some
were scurrying into cellars, others were
climbing telegraph-poles.- A -few threw
themselves on the sidewalks and made
noises like corpses. The' French revolu
tion was a promenade .concert alongside
the Reign -of Terror established by Alice
along the Coast -of Barbarys \u25a0
An old man caught Skein by the arm:
"Hold,' young !man," "said. "Do not
rush Into the 'slaughter. Think of your
family. . tThe sacrifice would, be useless.
It's Alice." \u25a0\u25a0'.. i : .
.But Skein made his way, forward over
the pites of wounded. -,He arrived at the
THE SA3NT FRANOIi^
Mariner's Delight Just as the night bar
tender came through the window, closely
pursued by \u25a0 the bar. and 'two \ beer - kegs."
The bartender sped .down the street .with
the j window sash encircling j his neck like
a horse collar. â¢ ; râ¢ ' ' f ' / r '. - : \
"Run for your life,"',*e shouted :to
Skein: V'lf's Alice." ; " â¢r ' '-:Â» '-' \u25a0'
Skein paused on .the .threshold. â¢. The
contents of the saloon: were 'pouring out

be. - ; \u25a0 â¢\u25a0'\u25a0 y-'^ -...-\u25a0 â¢:.-.":\u25a0 :'.-;"<, ":'\u25a0\u25a0 .- : ' -i' \u25a0\u25a0â¢:\u25a0.
. 'Td better try to .pacify it, '", said, Skein.
He. thrust his , head I through the .'door
and said soothingly, "Alice, where art
thou?"-,- - ' ./\u25a0. \u0084:\u25a0*'. :-. : . '-'i.'C '\u25a0 \u25a0
A bottle grazed, his ear, , assuring, him
that she was somewhere \u25a0 in I the - neigh
borhood. The next 'moment'-. Skein : was
tangled up with a mass t of arms,:- feet,
claws and red dress. 1 â¢ . 'â¢ ; . . ' < ;
Prostrate, victims along -the boulevard
dragged themselves to sitting 'positions to
watch the last stand. It was brief, Alice
made a* pass for Skein's . stomach | with
her foot. He dodged and 1 the" kick landed
on the amazon's own chin. "She 'tottered
and fell.
As Skein led her to the patrol box, the
scattered orchestras of - the . . devastated
music halls" began *to return.* By -the
time Skein reached .the^corner; accor
deons, banjos and 'cornets '.struck up,
"See the Conquering Hero Conies." Men
rushed forward to r grasp his ' hand ' and
women flocked to Hobsonize him. *",*
| At the City Prison Alice made" a ; last
gallant stand. .The matron- happened: to
be humming, "Oh, don't you remember
sweet Alice, Ben Bolt?" , Alice thought
that the song was personal. Before the
valiant" Skein :could ;, Interfere, she
reached out with her fist . and . smote the
matron. It took; all the extra -duty men
at the Central station to , get her :* into'
a dark cell.

an Irreparable breach in the friendship

which Is owned by, the Priors, the Bos-
worth family was denuded and lm

It happened In this way: The wash

line and almost dried, when the goat
butted r into ithe T garden; He began upon
the .hosiery/ of 'the young â¢ Bosworth,
switched: to'llngerle. at 1 entree time and
topped } off a the > meal with a dessert of
assorted carments.
/ In ; vain ; the : Bosworths shooed him
from 'their.' windows. -'.The goat had his
appetite with him and - the . clothing
tickled* \u25a0\u25a0 his , palate: The line was

HON. C. A. HUGHES, Attorney Legislative Investigating Committee, New York City:
Press accounts yesterday committee proceedings say \u25a0 McCurdy, swore that during
three years my term of office, Equitable and other companies, each paid my brother $150
a month for my bcne6t. If such statement was made or intimated by innuendoes I pro

PANIES OF THE EMPIRE STATE. " : -\u25a0'.V;: .-â¢;\u25a0 "
Former Insurance Commissioner An
drew J. Clunie of this city is very much
I aroused over the insinuations made
' against him by S. S. McCurdy of the
Equitable Life Insurance Society of
New York. Mr. Clunie returned to this
city last night after a short sojourn
In Los Angeles and at once Issued a
etatement to The Call, in which he
made a sweeping denial of the charges
brought against him by McCurdy.
Clunie was -in Los Angeles when the
news broke, but as soon as he read the
L press dispatches he hastened to this
cutting his southern trip short in
order to be on the ground and fully
deny the charges. Clunie says he is
willing to go to New York at any time
and tell all he knows in connection
with the matter. In an interview he
said: 7fÂ«flsEffinW
"The first news I received of the al
leged disclosures was when I read the
press dispatches at the hotel I was
staying at in Los Angelee. I deter
mined at once to return to. this -city
et)d communicate with C. 6. Hughes in
New York and to have this matter
Ftralgrhtened out. , I do not care to say
much at the present time, as I think it
would be discourteous to Mr. Hughes.
When I hear from him I will give fuller
details. The following-dispatch I jsent
to Mr. Hughes this afternoon."

"I had more troubles with the Equi

theÂ« warehouse of Newbauer Bros., at IS
First street, some time during the night
of January 16. The bunaie had been pre
pared by the proprietors, who 1 found that
they were being robbed.- to ; all appear
ancesT by some of their employes, but no
clew was ever grained as to who the thief
was. and at that time no suspicion was
cast upon any member of the police force.
Detectives investigated the matter \u25a0 at the
time and. forr- several days ; shadowed^ a
porter and a clerk, to and from their
work. : : ' Nothing of any consequence re
sulted and, as the robberies ceased, the
matter was dropped. - ->.
Detective. Silvey was . first detailed .on
the case on the morning of January IT.
: A message came to police headquarters
from Jesse ..Newbauer, , one-/, of .the pro
prietors, that the. establishment- -was
being: robbed, and; Captain John Martin,
then Captain - of. Detectives} sent Silyey \.o
investigate. - Silvey ( entered- the,, places and
went 'upstairs, ; where hfvs'as^met'by'New^
bauer. According to the story of . Silvey. 1
Newbauer shouted â¢ the T object of his; call
in a loud tone of ..voice and was heard, by
several . of the employes.' ,, As I Newbauer
fctated he sustected * some of \u25a0: his 'em
ployes of the. work, . Silvey, rebuked him
for not having communicated' ;\u25a0Â« this -In-,
formation secretly and "expressed" the idea
that his identity as " a detective being
known through the thoughtlessness of
the merchant he would be utterly useless
in the case. . : , ; v â¢'
I When the two men - were closeted j to
gether, Silvey explained, that he! would be
forced to abandon "the matter, , but said
he would have men sent in' his stead. .He
accordingly explained the situation to Cap T
tain Martin when he returned to, the Hall
of Justice i and Detectives 'Taylor and
Ryan were'glven charge of the investiga
tion, and made every possible > effort to
discover the identity of the thief. . '.
SILK WAISTS DISAPPEAR.
Newbauer- told the > police that he had
missed many articles from his warehouse,
and that on January 14 he had discovered
a bundle :of sllkV shirtwaists, \ carefully
wrapped, ; evidently some person ; who
awaited an' opportunity; of carrying them
away. A; consultation; was \ held -, and It
was decided *to - replace â¢ the" silk with old
rags and to: watch f or ithet return of the
thief.
Two days Â§ passed : and nothing devel
oped. Newbauer declded'to play, detective
on his own account and failed, to notify
the police. when: the house was
opened up on; the \u25a0: morning of the 17th of
January, the package /had disappeared

'Tis seldom that a pitcher has what
Billy Essick possessed yesterday at
. Recreation Park. He was there with a
spit ball, a flock of benders that broke
any way he wanted and control that
stood by him in his hour of need. On
top of all these good things he had
the support of his teammates, which
helped some. Net one of them com
mitted a blunder, though they bandied
chances of every variety and every hue.
L'p to the ninth spasm the Seals had
â¢ecured one lonely bingle off the ones
.'Essick twisted over. N'ealon tore- that
one off In the second. It seemed Easick
â¢would make it g-ood with but a hit for
6an Francisco, but with two down In
the ninth and two strikes on him Xea
lon swung through with a safety to
left. Householder followed with a dou
ble. Irwin ehot an easy one to Atz and
so the game came to a peaceful end.
Henley kept his in the groove all the
time and the Giants managed to rap
him when hits counted right. Henley
,-was lucky that Portland did not get
more runs tnan it did, for the north
ern sluggers were going to the ball
hard in every inning. Hildebrand
uropped a fly from Essick's bat in the
tourth that let Sweeney and McLean in.
l*p to that time Hllde was making all
kinds of wonderful catches. He stepped
into a rut or a bole when he had this
fly right in his mitt and dropped it
vrhen It looked In.
Atz's work at short was again won
derful. The little fielder handled ten
chances and none <ft them looked easy.
In the eighth Henley 'dispatched a hot
one that took a course right over sec
ond. Atz started in .back of the bag,
yet he did not seem to have a chance
to grab the ball. Bu\ he dug it up out
of the ground and retired the runner
at first, making a play that has never
Â«been surpassed by any shortstop in this
league. The score:

TOZEII AFTER A RECORD.
Pltcbes Jorij-rour Â£ucc*HÂ»lve Inning*
Without Allowing' a Ran.
LOS ANGELES. Nov. 18. â The pitch
ing of Tozer to-day, together with the
.srood work of the team behind him,
'chut Seattle out by the score of 5 to 0.
To-day's game makes forty-four suc
cessive innings Tozer has pitched with
out allowing the opposing team a run.
This lacks but one inning of equaling
the world's record of forty-five innings,
now held â¢by Chesbro. Seattle secured
but five hits off Tozer to-day. They
were so scattered there was no chance
of scoring. The Los Angeles pitcher
also rapped out a double and twJ
singles out of three times at the bat.
The visitors made four errors, most of
them wild throws, which aided " th-3
locals In their run-getting. Jones sup
planted Vickers in the fifth inning and
was slightly more effective. Score:

Golden"" Gate^Parif "Meet

3IATCHES AXE UNEQUAL
In Only Three Cases Is It
Found, Necessary W Play
the Full Three '' Sets
The third of a series of scratch Blngles
tennis tournaments for a silver loving
cup was 'played by the members of the
Golden Gate Junior Tennis Club . yester
day in the park courts. Play was com
pleted to the second round, j the success
ful players being M. McLoughlin, W. Pat
terson, H. Nevinson, R, Strachan, J.
Strachan, W. Finlay, H. Guerln and H.
Get*.
The fact that the boys met on even
terms accounts for the numerous one
sided matches. In only three cases was
It necessary, to play the full three sets.
Of the eifht players who qualified,- J.
Strachan was the only one in any danger
of losing.
In thÂ« second round Midget Strachan
met B. Bodkin, a new player, and the
club's smallest member had to play his
best to win. Bodkin took the first set
handily, but in the next two Strachan
steadied down and pulled out the match.
.It is safe to say there is not a tennis
player anywhere who is smaller than
Strachan and the way he bandies his
racket Is remarkable. -
M. McLougblin, the club champion, has
won the cup twice and there is little or
no doubt that, be will score the third
and final win in the present tournament.
He beats the boys with handicaps' and
surely can do so on even terms. R.
Strachan and H. Getz are the only play
ers who have any chance to beat him
and their chance is slight. -
The best match was. that between Getz
and Li. Levinson. The latter failed to
win a set, but his opponent did not have
as easy a time winning as the score in
dicates. Levinson took only two games
in the first set, but he made a strong bid
for the second and Just- failed to land
it.";:;.- â¢ â¢ '.
R. Strachan won both his matches
about as he pleased. He lost but one
game In each match. Patterson also had
an easy time and won without exerting
himself.
R. Williams made a fairly good show-
Ing against MclÂ»ughlirt. The latter won
the first set easily, but 'was forced to a
deuce set in the second.
W. Finlay, a, new player, won his
matches cleverly and will probably make
trouble for J. Strachan when they meeti
The scores follow:

Many tennis enthusiasts will go down
to Burlingame this morning to see Cham
pion Beais Wright in action. Wright
will probably confine himself to doubles,
as he is not In condition to do himself
justice in a singles match. He had some
practice yesterday with J. O. Tobin as
partner. Opposed to them were W. S.

â¢ R^IEVING THE PAIN \u25a0 ' f
IS NOT CURING THE DISEASED
\u25a0 j No class .of sufferers are subjected to such torture as are those afflicted .with Rheuma-
tism. When this disease becomes intrenched in the blood it seems to affect every part of
the body with its sharp,* shooting pains and other disagreeable symptoms. . The nerves sting,
the muscles throtj and jerk, the joints inflame and swell, the bones ache and the flesh be-
comes so swollen and tender that to touch it causes the most intense pam.
When the sufferer is in this condition relief must be .had at once,, and any treatment
that will ease the pain and suffering is.used. fiery liniments,' penetrating oils, etc.,
are applied and often medicines containing morphine or other destructive .opiates are taken
â¢internally. But relieving the pain is not curing the disease, and at the first exposure to cool
or damp weather or slight attack of indigestion the pains and aches will return. : - Â»
The aches and pains are only symptoms which you may scatter with plasters, liniments,
etc.,: or quiet withiOpiates, but the real.seat of the disease is in the blood, and until
this vital.stream is^cleansed of the acids and poisons and strengthened and built up, Rheu-
matism cannot be cured. The sufferer is wasting valuable time applying external treatment,
or using soothing drugs,becatise ttie longer

;The cause of Rheumatism is a too acid conditionof the blood, brought on by indigestion,
chronic .constipation, weak' kidneys, torpid liver and a. general sluggish condition of tne sys-
tem, r All.f ood taken into the body contains, in some form, the elements necessary to sustain

CONTEST IS CLOSE ONE
Winners Score Single Touch
down and Then Miss
the Try for a Goal
The football champlocahlp of the Acad
emic Athletic LeaffTio went .to the husky
representatives of the Berkeley HlgiiTl
School yesterday by a score of 5 to U.
The Lowell High School team was on the *
losing end.
From, the start the game proved close.
Considering the superior weight and the
older and more, experienced men against
which the Lowellltes had to. play, they
did remarkably well to hold Berkeley to
such a close score.
â¢ The" first half started by Captain So
llnsky of the winning team kicking off
to. LJscornla. the ball being downed orÂ»
the 10-yard line. Lowell was held for
downs, and punted to their 30-yard line.
On Berkeley's second down, the ball waa
fumbled. Lynn of Lowell falling on tt.
Lowell was held for downs, so Glberson
punted. Punting tactics prevailed, until
almost the end of the first half, when
Lowell, on being helu for a down near
their own goal, punted to the center oC
the field. From that point the Berkeley
players fought the hardest, bringing thtÂ»
ball gradually toward Lowell's goal line,
each time barely making three yard*.
With the ball four yards from Lowell';*
last lice. Fullback Peck was sent through
for the only touchdown of the day and
the touchdown which won for Berkeley
the championship of California, Tho
goal was missed.
- The nearest Lowell came to scoring waa
In the second half, backing from the cen
ter of the field to Berkeley's 13-yard line,
where they lost the ball on downsw
Throughout the contest the work of the
Lowell ends was much in evidence, and
the. way the Berkeley men were held was
due in a measure to their efforts, al- \u25a0
though Roneovleri'a work at quarter was^
much In evidence.
The star work, of the day, however, was
done by Berkeley's little Quarterback.
Miller. The way he ran In punts was
phenomenal. and his quarterback,
"sneaks" netted his team 30, 15 and 10
yards, respectively.
i Toward the last few minutes of play
: the Berkeley men got In a position to
try a field goal, but the attempt was
i unsuccessful, luckily for Lowell.

the crimson by a score of 16 to nothing.
Except for Quarterback Simons, who
weighed two pounds less, Roosevelt was
the lightest man on either team.
Every Bcrlmmage found the President's
eon fighting. Half-way down the field
Yale shoved the ball before Roosevfclt got
hi* chance. Finally Brides tried an end
run and was brought down flat. Center
was then tried for the first touchdown by
Tale, Yale kicked off again and Teddy
rot Into the scrimmage. The quarter
back tried a left end run. Roosevelt cir
cled the team like a flash and pulled down
his man.
In the second half Harvard was forced
to kick. Roosevelt was running after the
ball when Yale lnterferers knocked him
breathless. He staggered a minute and
then went on playing. In a few seconds
ho was out again. He was growing weak,
but began to get Into plays harder, throw
ing himself like a rocket at the Yale
team.
Bridges tried center. Teddy was clinging
to his legs almost before he struck the
line. Finally he was put out again and
he was carried struggling to his quarters.
HARVARD AND DARTMOUTH TIE.
Each Eleven Scores Six PolntH on the
Cambridge Gridiron.
CAMBRIDGE, Mass.. Nov. 18.â For
the third consecutive time the Harvard
football eleven to-day failed to win a
victory over the Dartmouth College
team, the score being a tie, 6 to 6. Last
year the result was also a tie, neither
having scored, while the year before
Dartmouth defeated Harvard 12 to 0.
Throughout the game Dartmouth
showed much superiority and most of
the pt*y was in Harvard's territory.
The scoring by both teams was the re
sult of line bucking. There were no
spectacular plays. The weather was
perfect for football and more than
20.000 spectators witnessed the con
test.
Both teams played a strong offensive
game, which throughout was clean and
open and free from slugging, although
both teams wore penalized for holding
and for off-side play. All the scoring
was done In the first half - and was
mainly the result of persistent rushing.
In the second half, after a sensation
al thirty-yard run around Harvard's
right end, R. Glaze dropped the ball and
a Harvard man fell on It on the crim
son's thirty-yard line. Dartmouth held,
however, and by steady rushing had the
ball on. Harvard's fifteen-yard line,
where a vain try for a goal from the
field was made. The ball was back in
the center of the field when the game
ended.
Soldier Found Not Guilty.
Private Frank Bensley of the. Third
Cavalry, who was charged with
"malingering with Intent to secure his
discharge from the service," was ac
quitted by, a general court-martial Frl-'
cay afternoon. Bensley was accused
of having purposely shot off the Index
finger of nis right hand with a rifle. ln
order to secure his release from the
army. According to the evidence at the
trial the shooting was accidental. It be
ing the old story of not knowing that
the gun waÂ« loaded. The court-mar
tlal's findings sustained Bensley's story
that the shooting was accidental. '

YALE ELEVEN
DOWNS TIGERS
Administers a Most Crush
ing Defeat to the Men
Representing Princeton
OPEN PLAY IS TRIED
Long Runs Around the Ends,"
Much Kicking and Quar
ters* Work Are Cheered
NEW HAVEN. Conn., Nov. 18.âFol
lowing the old-fashioned style of foot
ball. Yale gave Princeton to-day a 28
to 4 beating, the worst In many years.
The Princeton team had the satisfac
tion of breaking Yale's clean record by
a b'eautlful 48 yard drop kick by Took
er. But after all the blue can still point
to a goal line that has not been crossed
by an opponent this season.
The game was relieved from positive
dullness by Yale's adoption in the sec
ond half of the much-longed-for "open
play," when long runs around the ends,
much kicking. In which the quarter
backs did their share, and two bril
liant dashes by Quarterback Hutchlnson
of Yale, repeatedly brought 'the 30,000
spectators to their feet.
The singing at the game was inspir
ing, as it always Is, but Prlnoeton had
more lung power and nad the courage
to hurl their catchy songs across the
field, Yale's reply becoming enfeebled
as Interest In the game Increased. The
weather was so delightful that heavy
wraps were not needed. The charming
gowns of the women, much bedecked
with their favorites' streamers, made
.the ' great stands brilliant with color.
TALE'S LESSON WEU- LKAIO'ED.
Of the game as a football study it
was the old story of a well learned
lesson on the part of Yale, with plenty
of resources if they were needed. She
did not show a diversified attack, nor
even the variety used in last week's
stubborn game with Brown. She
scored In the first half by straight
plunging line plays, which tifegan to
have the desired effect after a muff of
a punt on Dillon's part. Yale was In
better shape In the second half, and by
adopting open play she was able to
wear down her opponent and at the
same time make matters Interesting.
Bo fast did Hutchlnson rush his men
that it looked as though the orange was
surely going to lose Its feet, and it
required Princton'e hymn, "For Old
Nassau," to bring about some of the
stonewall defense for which old Nassau
is noted. A few minutes before the end
Princeton rallied and carried the ball
to the Yale ten-yard line, there to lose
It on a fumble. Yale, to get out of
danger, resorted to a kick, but it cov
ered only thirty- three yards and a fair
catch gave Tooker his opportunity to
win glory and for the Princeton side to
score.
INTERFERENCE IS GOOD.
The visitors found the weak spot to be
Forbes on the left side until Yale's sec
ondary defense stopped the . hole and
helped out Forbes and Gates. The sec
ond wing was also Princeton's weak
place and the quick starting Yale backs
seemed to be able to get through there
with considerable ease, although not for
long distances. In all the game Yale
used only one cross buck and one double
pass,, tackle and guard plays being ap
parently all that was required as ground
gainers against the line. 'Yale's inter
ference was good, formed instantly and
always knew where to go. .
. The power of Yale's offense was shown
unmistakably in the second half. Prince
ton had -good ends, but they were fre
quently boxed, which was the secret of
Yale's ability to" make . runs. Princeton
had a good attack, although Captain
Cooney had to be used much of the time
and late In the game he appeared well
tired out.
Substitutes were many in her line-up,
while Yale had no need to put In any,
so well trained were Yale's men.
The features of the game were the
dashes of Hutchlnson, who has never
played better. The first time he made
28 yards, during which he made a flying
leap over a Princeton tackier. The sec
ond time he covered seventy yards and
was only pulled down when twenty-five
yards from Princeton's goaL Penalties
were' frequent. The lineup:

FOUR MEN ARE INJURED
Football Elevens j Rush to
the Assistance of the Per
sons Caught in the Debris
ANN ARBOR, Mich., Nov. 18.âWeak
ened by the' stamping in unison of 2000
people, the west bleacher on' Ferris
Fleld N collapsed this afternoon, ten min
utes after the second half of the footDall'
game between Michigan .: and Wisconsin
had begun. Almost miraculously no one
who was precipitated to ' the ground was
badly Injured. The bleachers | had no
seats, being merely/ a series of terraced
platforms running up. to a height of about
twelve feet on . which the * people stood.
This fact is believed- to be responsible
for the lack of serious injuries. Less
than a dozen ' occupants of the I crowded
stand were hurt enough; to have a physi
cian attend them. Following are among
those most painfully hurt:
Vern Huir, Milwaukee, Wis., hurt abont
the head. . -
F. W. Scott, Ypsllantl, Mich. \u25a0
Joseph Cross, Ann Arbor. . :
John B. Strayer, Pittsburg, Pa. ;
Twenty minutes before the stand
crashed the officials discovered it was
weakening and tried to have It vacated.
The occupants were j loath to leave their
places, however, and few of them had
moved when the south end gave way.
The collapse was gradual and section
after section of the stand slowly caved in.
The first crash of breaking boards at
tracted the attention |of both football
teams and thousands In the other Btands,
and before the last section had entirely
collapsed ! the game had boen stopped and
both teams wero running to tear down the
fence surrounding the gridiron from the
bleachers. A tremendous cloud of dust
rose as the stand gradually went down,
and" many of the people in the north
end had time to leap to the ground be
fore that portion went down. Thousands
of spectators rushed to the rescue and, in
a few* moments the people who had been
caught by the broken \u25a0 planks had . been
liberated. Men . searched under the
wreckage for any possible victims who
had been buried; but there were none.
Doctors from the crowd \u25a0 attended all of
those, who were injured, and In fifteen
minutes it was known : that no one bad
been seriously hurt.
MICHIGAN DEFEATS WISCONSIN.
The Winning Eleven Scores One Touch
down In Each Half.
ANN aHBOR, Mich., Nov. 18. â Mich
igan's football eleven defeated Wiscon
sin on Ferry Field this afternoon 12 to
0, scoring one touchdown In each. half.
The first touchdown was almost .a re
plica of the play which gave Minnesota
her first touchdown against .Wisconsin
at Minneapolis two weeks ago, Melzner
fumbling a punt and Michigan getting
the ball on, Wisconsin's four-yard line.
It took the third down to get the nec
essary four yards. The touchdown In
the second half followed a march
straight down the field for eighty
yards, Michigan taking the ball from
her thirty- yard line after an exchange
of punts and never once losing it until
finally Longman was shoved . over , the
Wisconsin goal 'line. Both teams fum
bled badly..: Wisconsin played the game
out without a substitute, although
DeÂ«rlng, Roseth and .. Bertke were out
and bleeding before the game had-pro
gressed 'fifteen minutes.' \u25a0 Michigan
used two substitutes, Barlow, taking,
Norcross* place'at quarter In the, second
half and Clark going in for Weeks.
To-day's victory by Michigan brings
this year's struggle for the Western
championship down to Michigan and
Chicago, as -Minnesota, the only other
team that- looked strong enough to
contend for the honor, has already been
defeated by - Wisconsin. The game In
Chicago on Thanksgiving day, there
fore, will settle decisively which team
shall hold this coveted honor.
NEIL IS PROMISED

Jem Bowkar and Frankle Nell will fight
for the world's bantam-weight champion

tional match \u25a0 of ' this character will cer
tainly , prove a great attraction for the

Bowker gained a decision over Nell In
London, - and with It went the world*
championship to England. Nell has al
ways contended that he would have beat
en-the Britisher had he not been restrict
ed so much by the referee. .
At all events, the American followers
of the pugilistic game will have a chance
to see the pair In action in a few months.
A. F.= Bettison, who not only represents

little weight In the -last year and will not
be able to box under 119 . pounds, "/weigh

-HAVANA, Nov. 18.â The truth In thÂ«

The Government received a confidential
report to the effect that an ostensibly
vacant house in the Cerro suburb was
being utilized as a secret depository' f^>r
arms and ammunition. The police found
forty-one rifles, twenty-one (carbines;
twenty-one packages, each containing
a thousand cartridges, and some bar

toward the Liberal and Radical lead

the arms and ammunition were seized,
but no arrests have yet been reported.
It is said that other Installments; of
arras are hidden in various parts of : the
Island. The . rifles \ seized to-day were
new and of costly pattern.
Americans who have arrived here form
the Isle of Pines are unanimous In as
serting: that' the . participants 'in the
meeting of November 11 had no idea
that the so-called territorial officers
would attempt to assume office. They
say it . was generally, understood that
their election, was only, a basis, first
for an appeal to Washington and sec
ond as a newspaper advertising move
ment. It having been long a matter of
complaint on the part of some of the
residents of the Isle of^Plnes that the
newspapers were not _ln"sympathy .with

, It ia asserted on good authority that
exactly eighty men attended the meet-
Ing on November 11, besides \u25a0 many
women. The number of male American
residents on the Isle of Pines ia gen
erally estimated at 200.
No Americans on the Isle of Pines ap
pear to expect a clash with the. Cuban

SHAW OPPOSES
AID FOR BANKS
Difference of ;Opinion Be
tween! President and Sec
retary of the Treasury
NO DECISION REACHED
Mr. Roosevelt Is in Favor
of Advancing $25,000,000
to New! -Fork Concerns
Sped*! Dispatch to TIM Call.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 18.â President
Roosevelt and Secretary Shaw had a Ions;
conversation to-day In - which the advis
ability of assisting the New York banks
was considered. A marked difference of
opinion developed between the President
and bis I Secretary of the Treasury.' The
President la understood to have | Insisted
that 125,000,000 of Government funds
should at once be* placed In the various
New York banks to assist them In avert
ing a: stringency in the money market.
Shaw opposed j this, arguing that no neces
sity now existed for Government ' assist
ance.,- A final decision on the subject was
not reached, but Secretary Shaw con
veyed - the impression that no assistance
would be given the' New York banks. ! .
It Is believed that aid will be given the
banks by the . treasury within a brief . pe
riod, notwithstanding the positive declara
tions heretofore made by; Shaw. \u25a0 There
have In the past been. many serious dif
ferences of opinion between, the President
and Shaw, In all of which the President
has scored the victory.
Definite orders issued by the President
for the depositing of Government funds
In ; ; New â¢ York or Chicago banks must
meet with prompt compliance by the Sec
retary. A refusal onÂ» Shaw's, part to obey
positive Instructions would i result In his
forced retirement before the expiration
of his . four years' term next February.

spirits, low -and easily .depressed, who are backward, hesitat-
ing, unable to venture because they are afraid of failure, who
want somebody to decide for them, who are weak, puny, rest-
less. It is to men who have part or all of these symptoms and<
want new life, new force, new vigor. I offer it to you in my

why he should ever have been charged
with this offense. . â¢
"As to Dr. Thomas,' the evidence of

have been offered for. the defense, since
it showed that .from the" time this un
fortunate girl came to the apartments,
where she died, there was never at any
time -an - opportunity for,' Dr. Thomas
to have performed any operation upon
her, since hÂ© was never with her alone.
The evldenoe also' shows that his treat

THAT MAN CITT HIS THROAT
John Lally Found Dead In Doorway*
and Antopny Shows He Died
v. From Natural Causes.
John' Lally. a cook, was found dead
in a doorway at 503 Broadway at 4
o'clock yesterday morning, covered
with blood, and Policeman Kavanaugh
was notified. In his report he said
Lally* had cut his throat with a sharp
pocket* knife, and he notified police
headquarters. vDetective Coleman. who
was on night duty, hurried to the scene,
and he also reported that there were
two cuts on Lally' s throat, that the
knife was found beside the body and
a knife cover In Lally's vest pocket.
The body was removed to the
Morgue, and vhen the autopsy was
made no cuts were discovered in Lally's
throat, and it waa found that death had
been caused by a rupture of the aorta,
in the region of the heart. The ofilcera
had jumped to the conclusion that Lal
ly had cut his throat from the fact that
his neck and chest were covered with
blood. Lally was well known on the
Bar bary Coast, and had recently been
employed in the Columbia dance hall.
He had been sick for about a week.

We have had the most remarkable sale of
lots ever made In the vicinity of San Fran-
cisco. The. reasons for this sale are apparent
to any thinking man. They are. In short: '-.'
Burlingame Is the closest to San Francisco
In point of time and distance of any real
desirable suburb. 'It has as good' a climate as
can be found anywhere In the world. Land is
selling now for prices several times less "than
property In other suburbs not co desirable. ,'
In Burlln*ame Park you eecure at a . small
cost the combined efforts of brains and cap-
ital expended for the' past 25 years. . -This
park was not made In a day. . It was laid;
out 25 years asro and roads were built and.
trees planted, the latter having attained their
full growth and beauty. ' ',
The property Hes close to the electric car.
line already built (not a prospect) " and you
also have the train service which now takes
only 88 minutes and which most other property
dawn .the p'enUiÃula Tnotienjoy. ' You have
also the certainty that the Bay. Shore cutoff
will reduce the railroad , time to 25 minutes In
the near j future. There are\ no -\ ferry j boate
needed to reach' Burlirucame ,'or "any " trans-
ferriqg.'. : ft i* as close to : the -business^'center
of San \ Francisco as" many .pf 8 the ' residence
sections of San Francisco. -. ' . '\u25a0 ,;'
Its natural beauty and ..unsurpassed 'climate
will attract thousand* In . the near . future, In
fact, the tide has set toward .Burlingame and
It. has already made a- starts for great, im-
provement. .. â¢", . .J. \u25a0\u25a0:-'\u25a0. .-."l.t^*

"FrVE* HUNDRED DOLLAR GRATITUDE."
Editor Engleke's testimony; "My friend, Mr.
R.. a prominent, city capitalist (whose NAME
. I can- give -you) was- for years LAME from ,
-advanced" PARALYSIS, which all medical
sldlL eU:.,- \u25a0 utterly failed to relieve. His
LIMB was very feeble, bis WALK slow,
with short, unsteady â¢ steps, constantly liable
to stumble and fall. He could . not RAISE
'the' limb, 'and of course was entirely unable
to walk fast run or leap, even bad bis life
depended on It A friend of his â ex-Recor-
der of S. F. â told . him he had been won-
derfully cured by. Rexradlo, and strongly
advised him to take the . latter* s drugleas
treatment; he did so and in a FEW SEC-
ONDS his LIMB became full of life and
- strength, and he Instantly used it NAT-
URALLY. I S-A-W him,, without help ,of
cane or crutch, WALK fast with long
strides. RAISE his foot, and vigorously
KICK a hand held FOUR FEET high, then
RUN like an athlete and LEAP often from
the floor. It was an AMAZING sight. He
taid to me later: "It was extremely MAR-
VELOUS, and after paying Rexradio liberal
fees. I made htm a PRESENT of $600."
Months after this he could still RUN.
JUMP, etc He Is willing to be rNTER-
VTEWET>. and will also tell you of many
he SAW treated successfully for total
DEAFNESS. PARALYSIS. LOCOMOTOR
ATAXIA and other severe diseases. Get his
address of me. Rexradlo in SECONDS
cured my chrcnle extreme RHEUMATISM,
enabling me to RUN and LEAP, which I
â¢ can still do after the lapse of ONE HUN-
1 DRED and NINE DAYS. I will give you
numerous NAMES of patients wonderfully
helped by him for PARALYSIS, total DEAF-

AUBURY ; SCORES - FAKERS.
At the El Paso Congress of Miners a
paper was read â¢ that \u25a0 had 5 been prepared
by- State Mineralogist VAubury In which
the subject of ? prevention of mining
frauds by State legislation ..was discussed
at', some length.' Aubury I contended - that
a large amount ; of foreign capital / has
been diverted from , mining enterprises In
this country and has gone ; to Mexico for
Investment ;by reason of : r mlning fakers
who have : Inspired j- distrust in legitimate
mining.
, "Not. until confidence has been re-estab
lished In our ; mines," 1 said Mr. , Aubury,
"bo that 'the: investor* can; feel that he
Is protected. 1 - &o- I* look for the tide to
turn our way.* LÂ«t ; us rid ourselves of
these leeches \u25a0;. as soon as possible,' and
the sooner the better; and. .when this has
been accomplished, mining will have been
placed on a higher standard and the legit
imate promoter will have Bome'chance of
enlisting i capital ;i to 'aid him In develop

' > As it is, the investor, with no knowledge of
mining is not generally awe 1 to distinguish ths
good from . the bad. and It Is useless to tell
him of the necessity for securing expert opinion
before Investing. He listens to the tale of the
wily - faker.- who ' speaks of ' guaranteed divi
dends, fabulous assays, etc., and obtains ex
pert advice after he has invested, and when tho
promises . mads him fall to materialize. When
he realises ' that he has been handed a "gold

jures mining and mining . operators and loses
no .opportunity to condemn the i same. - If, > ob

ment in a \u25a0 legitimate - proposition, " there Is a
strong probability that -his capital could again
be enlisted In . mining, and ' the Industry would
have gained a friend instead of an. enemy.
. It Is occasionally found that* in some mining
communities j which . temporarily 1 profit from the
operation of fake concerns in their midst that
an attempt Is made to uphold. them. -but such
attempts Invariably react upon the community
or district. where support' la given to the faker.
As a general rule, : however, most mining com
munities frown, upon the methods of . the faker
and would welcome any restraining laws which
would prevent him from operating among- them.
It ie possible that my : suggestions regarding
the enactment of State laws which will restrain
or obliterate- -the. mining faker. may meet with

ment, v While I : am i willing . to 'admit â¢ a large
number of j investors \u25a0 exist who . need the ser
vices of guardians, yet I .believe, that it is due
to the mmmg 'Industry of the United ' States
that -we use every means In' our power to place
legitimate mining on the nlghest plane possi
ble, and. -while -we may have : been dilatory in
passing needed laws whlcn would- protect tho
Investor,- let us make a beginning now. There
1b no time like the present. .Let -mining be
freed from' the barnacles which have attached
to it,', and let us rid ourselves of a class who
are not miners and never will be, but will con
tinue to prey upon the . industry unless \u25a0 some*
means are adopted to annihilate .them. I have
suggested State. legislation,, and it may be
asked why not Federal legislation? To this I
will say. that the latter would be most desir
able, ( but there are difficulties in the : way,
and that it might take years to- accomplish
the object sought. Let us try State legislation
first, as that can undoubtedly be secured im

Jimmy Gardner "said he weighed 133
pounds yesterday when he had finished
his day's training. To-day and Mon
day will be the last two days of boxing
for Gardner and from Tuesday up to
and Including Thursday only light
work will be taken, and rrom the
weight announced yesterday It Is
thought Jimmy will enter tho ring
weighing around the 140 pound mark.
Jimmy took his usual run yesterday
morning In company with his brother
George, and after' the six miles had
been finished he appeared In no way
distressed, although the work was
most punishing to the older Gardner.
His gymnasium work was witnessed
by a large crowd and it lasted through
the greater part of an hour. The box
ing was with Joe Angeli, with whom
Jimmy sparred four rounds, and when
the last round was over Joe V^as the
most pleased personin the gym. Gard
ner has shown great form all through
his training and his condition Is highly
pleasing to his friends, who intend to
back him heavily against Mike (Twin)
Sullivan Friday night.
Sullivan cut out hi 3 boxing bout
With* his brother Jack yesterday and
contented himself with four rounds on
the 'light; punching bag. two rounds on
the heavy bag and a lot of .shadow
boxing., Mike also wrestled with ..his
brother Dave and tossed 'the medicine
ball for a few minutes."" This concluded
his day's work and before going into
the rubbing-room he announced to his
visitors that he would box to-day_wltn
Twin Jack.
Betting on the contest will no doubt
start to-morrow. It Is thought" Gard
ner will open a slight favorite over the
tall Cambridge boxer. .".

ZOE GREEN RADCLIFFE.
OAKLAND, Nov. 18. â It is not given
to every one to look back upon almost
a century of years, and those years
filled with noble purpose and worthy
deeds; but to Mrs. Susan L. Mills,
the dean of teachers, was that Joy
SÂ»ven to-day, when she celebrated her
eightieth birthday. The occasion Is al
ways one of greneral rejoicing, but
there. seemed to be an added fervor In
the congratulations and good wishes
that were showered upon the gentle
and venerable lady.
As Mrs. Mills' iniiuence has covered a
vast field, so from all parts of the
earth telegrams and letters conveyed
loving messages from pupils and co
workers in the educational world.
With the day came good wishes from all
the great colleges in the United States,
including Mount Holyoke, Mrs. Mills'
own alma mater. Princeton, Bryn
Mawr. Yale. Harvard. Columbia, Vas
sar, Wellesley and others remembered
the event, and among the many letters
â¢was a particularly delightful one from
Professor Henry Van Dyke.
The exercises at the college begun
with the noon stroke of the bell in the
clock tower, and soon after the alum
nae and friends began to troop into the
college grounds in happy, schoolday
fashion. The Tormal programme In
Lisstr Hall began at 2 , o'clock. Dr.
Charles li. Brown presiding. The open
ing prelude on the organ was played
by Miss Zuletta Geery, after which fol
lowed a choral selection and prayer.
Among those who made felicitous
speeches were Professor Lisser; Pro
fessor Gayley, in behalf of President
Wheeler of the University of Califor
nia; Professor Stillman of Stanford,
Judge W. W. Morrow, Thomas Kirk,
State Superintendent of Schools, Hon.
Warren Olney, Miss Clara Witten
meyer for the faculty. Miss Mabel
Thayer Gray for the alumnae and Mrs.
Corona Wright for the Mills Club. '
A resume of various endowments and
gifts made during the year to Mrs. Mills
for the college \u25a0was read by Dr. Brown,
and then, after more music, everybody
was invited to participate in the ban
quet that was served 5n the beautifully
decorated dining-room. Great quantities
of flowers had come from everywhere,
atid* v ith the many gifts that were on
display^ held the pleased attentions of the
visitors' fcr smother happy hour. A check
for $30<X> from Mrs. Florence Hope Frank,
another for (130 from some mining men
In Grass Valley for the new gymnasium;
a solid silver tea set from. Sequoia Chap
ter, a beautifully illuminated testimonial
from ex-students in Hawaii were a few
of the many rare and lovely gilts of
which Mrs. Mills was the delighted re
cipient.
During the life of her husband, the late
l>r. Cyrus T. Mills, Mrs. MiJls was prom
tnent in educational circles In India and
later in Hawaii, where Tor several years
Dr. Mills filled the office of president of
Oahu College, and his wife was < professor
of natural sciences and English. In 1871
Dr. and Mrs. Mills founded the present
college, which now consists of seven fine
buildings, and educationally it ranks with
the best of its kind in the Lnited States.
During the last year 9100,000 has been
added to the endowment fund, the library
has 50,000 bocks and a building fund of
$25,000; Edward Coieman has endowed a
chair of English literature with $40,000,

her to the; office? of the : Chief, of ,- Police,
and, after explaining the case, left Uhe
girl in custody. Later the young ;woman

the case was placed in tne hands of Con

tended to have her arrested she broke
down and cried and acknowledged" her
guilt. This, was last Monday/ evening.
She returned a lot of the things whicii
she had concealed, among: her own

MINE MANAGER
IN BAD TANGLE
The -creditors of J. C. Kemp Van Ec,
manager of the Royal mine of Calaveras
County, have decided to force him into
bankruptcy/ Yesterday a number of rep
resentatives of prominent local firms, In
cluding the Anglo-Calif ornian Bank, the
Union Iron Works, General Electric Com
pany and Haas ; Brothers, and several
smaller creditors.' represented by Attor
ney Kirk, held " a meeting In the offices
of Attorney ; Jesse ,"W\ LJlienthal and
agreed that t bankruptcy proceedings were
their only chance of getting: a settlement
from. Kemp Van Ec, whose Indebtedness
to th^m aggregates $125,000. . : V.7\..
\u25a0* A committee of five, of which Attorney
Kirk was chosen the legal adviser, was
appointed Tto", institute the proceedings in
the United .States court. The action of
the creditors follows * closely on a suit
brought In Stockton a week agQ,by, J i; D.
Peters and A. C. Oullahan, president and
secretary respectively of a comaany of
that -city- -which, it, is alleged Kemp Van
Ec has attempted to defraud. In the
complaint' filed In Stockton it Is chareed
that the company of which Peters is the
president sold the Royal mineito Kemp
Van Ec for $400,000, he paying $60,000 down
and- agreeing 'to pay the balance in four
years. Instead of keeping his agreement
it was alleged that he proceeded to de
teriorate the.value'of the mine so as to
defraud' the .original owners.
'- Yesterday's action of the creditors in
this city was for the purpose of protecting
their interests. Kemp Van Ee's experl
ences with the Royal mine' have been
most disastrous to himself. Under the
corporate name of the Royal Consolidated
Mine of California, Limited, Van Ec float
ed the property: on the English market
for 51,400.000 and | mortgage bonds \u25a0 were
Issued to English investors to .the extent
of 1375,000. ' ,
A: few months ago the English stock
holders grew dissatisfied with the way
the mine was! being managed by Van Ec
and they sent a representative- here -to
Investigate the property. .-About this time
a suit for an accounting \u25a0 was brought
against Van Ec in -the Federal courts In
thl3 city by J. -H; Brotherton of Denver
respecting an interest in. the. mine of, the
two partners. This case is still pending
in the courts and has so tied up the prop
erty that Van Ec Is unable to dispose of
it. The Royal mine is located at Hodson
and has been pronounced a valuable one
by prominent mining | engineers.
LAWYER KROUSE . REUANDEO
AND HE IS NOW IN JAIL
\u25a0 Attorney H. A. Krouse has failed In
his ."final effort to escape the {Judgment
of imprisonment Imposed upon him by
Superior- Judge 1 - Graham . for contempt
of .- court\ for -unprofessional conduct
during ' the"" hearing -of the application
of Charlotta Newman Collins for Judg
ment for maintenance against - George
D.-- Collins, 1 ; alleged ] bigamist. > Krouse
sought to escape the Judgment for con
tempt in the District Court of Appeal,
and this falling, -went to \u25a0 the Supreme
Court. ' Yesterday Justice McFarland
dismissed his appeal and remanded him
to the custody of the ' Sheriff.
Attorney Krouse spent last night in
the;' County 'Jail and In. all likelihood
he will remain'' there until. to-morrow.
Then we will appeal to the Supreme
Court as k whole and he will attack
the i* proceedings before the : Superior
Court: In ah .%\u25a0 interview last night
Krouse stated that Justice ; McFarland
had only decided one point, and on this
point .: the ; decision was made against
him.'. Krouse* s contention was that the
judgment, should' have^ read so^ that he
could I have satisfied .the fine In* part by
Imprisonment," If he'so'deslred, and by
coin; for .-that; part of It* that had not
been satisfied. ; In . this * matter Justice
McFarland i ruled against . him.
â¢:\u25a0 Krou3e'did not%xpect that the ruling
against ' him jvould ' be ; handed down
yesterday. .He^expected that he would
have his liberty 'till- Monday, and thus
was i not , prepared with a bjrief :\ that
would t continue . his return fight. To

FRESNO MYSTERY
AGAIN REVIVED
Special Dispatch to Th* Call.
RENO, Nov. IS.â lt Is the general belief
that J. P. Sevener. one of the four mur
derers hanged at Carson Friday.' made a
confession, shortly before his execution.
of the murder of Louis B. McWhirter at
Fresno/twelve years ago. The confession
is believed to. have been made to his
spiritual adviser. It Is the firm belief of
Captain Miles of the death watch . that
Sevener is guilty of the crime. This be
lief was formed from conversations Miles
had with the convict while the latter was
in the condemned cell.
Sevener was In Fresno at the tune the
crime was committed and seems to be
acquainted with all the details. Sevener
was considered the most desperate of thÂ»
four murderers. The murder of McWhir
ter. was long ago placed on the list of on
solved crimes, and that Sevener Is thÂ»
man whom the officers have searched for
all these years in vain Is thought to be
quite plausible by those, tax -possession, of
knowledge of Sevener's black career of
crime. . _ . .
BENEDICTINE MONKS

LOS ANGELES, Nov. 15.â Still an
other large enterprise Is In view for
Southern California In the broad scheme
of development now being carried out
by the Roman Catholic church in - -Its
various branches of activity. It is . thÂ«
establishment of a permanent commun
ity of the Benedictine monks, carrying
with it various accompanying enter
prises and- institutions.
The plans are so far matured that all
that awaits Is the formal sanction of
Bishop -Conaty. This doubtless will be
granted upon the return- of the Bishop
from Rome, as he had already Invited
two of the -Benedictine fathers to taka
work In this diocese.
. Montebello, a beautiful suburban
settlement lying midway between Boyle
Height and Whlttler, Is the 'nits
selected, and this . latest move is to
come about through the generosity of
the Basques of California.
These people propose to purchase the
thirty acres -of I land needed for the first
community establishment of : the Bene^
dlctines, and to provide a large sum ' of
money to erect the first buildings. They
already have paid for ten acres of the
choicest land hi the Montebello district
and have taken contracts on twenty seres
adjoining, for which have pledges
sufficient to meet future payments. ? \Â°*
Representing the ' wealthy Basques of
