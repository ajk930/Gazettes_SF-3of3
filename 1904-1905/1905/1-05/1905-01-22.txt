IN the key of E flatthree of the notes are flats,
and in this lesson the chords which are neces
sary to play accompaniments in that key are
shown in the lower chart. The upper chart
has the chords of the key of C minor, the rela
tive of the key of E flat major. The top, middle
and lower sections of each chart give the three
chords of each key, and no further instruction is
necessary to enable any one to accompany a soloist,
vocal or instrumental, in any musical selections
written in those keys. The colored letters are to
be played with the left hand, the black letters
with the right hand.
. Having placed the chart on the piano, play
the colored letter in the top section with the left
hand, and then the three black letters in unison
with the right hand. Next play the middle section
in the same way, then the lower section, and then
return to the top section. The small letter D, with
a dash above it, which gives the chart position,
must not be played.
After a brief practice these chords can be
memorized and you can play without the use of the
chart. But with the chart a person who never
struck a note on the piano before may in a few
minutes play the harmonious chords correctly, and
then accompany his or her own songs or the songs
of friends.
Proficiency requires a little practice, but no
previous knowledge of music.
If you desire to delve deeply into the mysteries
of music the charfs give you the best possible
fo/indation on which to base a musical education.
A knowledge of the keys and their chords underlies
all the triumphs of the accomplished musician.

/">f O they went in doing as
\o\ B he bade them, and walked back
V 1 through the gardens, that now
Wr Beemed empty enough, to the
stable entrance of the guest
house, where the guards admitted
them without question.
That night the brethren slept to
gether in one bed, fearing that if they
lay separate they might be searched
in their sleep and not awake. Indeed,
it seemed to them that, as before, they
heard footsteps and voices in the dark
ness.
Next morning, when they had break
fasted, they loitered awhile, hoping to
win speech with Rosamund, or sight
of her, or at least that Masouda would
come to them: but they saw no Rosa
mund, end no Masouda came. At
length Â«;n officer appeared, and beck
oned to them to follow him. So they
followed, and were led through the
halls aid passages to the terrace or
justice, where SinaA, clad in his black
rooe, sat as before beneath the canopy
in the midst of the sunlit marble floor.
There, too, beside him, also beneath
the canopy and gorgeously appareled,
sat Rosamund. They strove to ad
vance and speak with her, but guards
came between them, pointing out a
place where they must stand a few
yards away. Only Wulf said in a
loud voice, la English:
"Tell us, Rosamund, is It well with
you?" Lifting her pale face, she
smiled and nodded.
Then, at the bidding of Slnan, Ma
souda commanded them to be silent,
saying that it wus not lawful for them
to speak to the Lord of the Mountain
or his Companion, unless they were
first bidden so to do. So, having
learned what they wished to know,
tbey were silent.
Now some of the dais drew near the
canopy and consulted with their master
on what seemed to be a great matter,
for their faces were troubled. Present
ly he gave an order, whereon they re
sumed their seats and messengers left
the terrace. When they appeared
again, in their company were three
noble-looking Saracens, who were ac
companied by a retinue of servants
and wore green turbans, showing that
they were descendants of the Prophet.
These men, who seemed weary with
long travel, marched up the ten-ace
with a proud mien, not looking at the
dais or any one until they saw the
brethren standing side by side, at
whom they stared a little. Next they
caught sight of Rosamund sitting in
the shadow of the canopy, and bowed
to her, but of the Al-Jebal they took
no notice.
"Who are you, and your pleasure?"
asked Sinan, after he had eyed them
awhile. "I am the ruler of this coun
try. These are my ministers," and he
pointed to the dais, "and here is my
scepter." and he touched the blood-red
dagger broidered on his robe of black.
Now that Sinan had declared him
self the embassy bowed to him courte
ously enough. Then their spokesman
answered him.
"That scepter we know; it has been
seen afar. Twice already we have cut
down its bearers even in the tent of
our master. Lord of Murder, we ac
knowledge the emblem of murder, and
we bow to you whose title is the Great
Murderer. As for our mission, it is
this: We are the embassadors of Sa
lah-ed-din, Commander of the Faithful,
Sultan of the East; in these papers
signed with our signet are our creden
tials, if you will read them."
"go," answered Sinan, "I have heard
of that chief. What is his will with
me?"
"This, Al-Jebal. A Frank in your
pay and a traitor has betrayed to you
a certain lady, niece of Salah-ed-din.
the Princess of Baalbec. whose father
wss a Frankish noble named D'Arcy
and who herself is named Rose of the
AVorld. The Sultan, Salah-ed-din, hav
ing been informed of this matter by
his servant, the Prince Hassan, who
escaped from your soldiers, demands
that this lady, his niece, be delivered
to him forthwith, and with her the
head of the Frank, Lozelle."
"The head of the Frank Lozelle he
may have if he will after to-morrow
night. The lady I keep," snarled Slnan.
"What then?"
"Then, Al-Jebal, in the nanie of Sa
lah-ed-din we declare war on youâwar
till this high place of yours is pulled
stone from stone; war till your tribe be
dead, till the last man, woman and
child be slain, until your carcass is
tossed to the crows to feed on."
Now Sinan rose in his fury and rent
at his beard.
"Go back," he said, "and tell that dog
you name a Sultan that, low as he is,
the humble born son of Ayoub, I, Al-
Jebal, do him an honor that he does not
deserve. My Queen Is dead, and two
days from now, when my month of
mourning is exDired, I shall take to
wife his niece, the Princess of Baalbec,
who sits here beside me, my bride
elect."
At these words Rosamund, who had
been listening intently, started like one
who has been stung by a snake, put
her hands before her face and groaned.
"Princess," said the embassador, who
was watching her, "you seem to under
stand our language; is this your will
to mate your noble blood with that of
the heretic chief of the Assassins'?"
"Nay, nay!" she cried. "It is no
will of mine, who am a helpless pris
oner and by faith a Christian. If my
uncle, Salah-ed-dln, is Indeed as great
as I have heard, then, let him show his
power and deliver me, andÂ« with me
my brethren, the knights Sir
Godwin and Sir Wulf."
"So you speak Arabic." said Sinan.
"Cood; our loving converse will be
easier, and for the restâwell, the
whims of women change. Now, you
messengers of Salah-ed-dln, begone,
lest I send you on a longer Journey;
and tell your master that if he dares
to lift his standards against my walls
my fedals shall speak with him. By
day and by night, not for one moment
shall he be safe. Poison shall lurk in
his cup and a dagger in his bed. Let
him kill a hundred of them and an
other hundred shall appear. His most
trusted guards shall be his
ers. The women In his harem shall
bring him to his doomâaye, death
shall be in the very air he breathes.
If he would escape it, therefore, let
him hide himself within Jhe walls of
his city of Damascus, or amuse him
self with wars against the mad cross
worshipers, and leave me to live in
peace with this lady whom I have
chosen."
"Great words, worthy of the Great
Assassin," said the embassador.
"Great words In truth, which shall
be followed by great deeds. What
chance has this lord of yours against
a nation sworn to obey to the death?
You smile! Then come hither youâ
and you." And he summoned two of
his dais by name.
They rose and bowed before him.
"Now, my worthy servants," he said,
"show these heretic dogs how you
obey, that their master may learn the
power of your master. You are old
and weary of life. Begone, and await
me in paradise."
The two old men bowed again,
trembling a little. Then, straighten
ing themselves, without a word, they
ran side by side and leaped into the
abyss.
"Has Salah-ed-din servants such as
these?" asked Slnan in the silence that
followed. "Well, what they have done
all would do, if I bid them slay him.
Back, now; and, if you will, take these
Franks with you, who are my guests,
that they may bear witness of what
you have seen and of the state in
which you left their sister. Translate
to the*knights, woman."
So Masouda translated. Then God
win answered through her.
"We understand little of this matter,
who are ignorant of your tongue, but,
O Al-Jebal. ere we leave your shelter
ing roof we have a Quarrel to settle
with the man Loxelle. After that, with
your permission, we will go, but not
before."
Now Rosamund sighed as If in re
lief, and Slnan answered:
"As you wiH; so be it," adding, "give
these envoys food and drink before
they go."
But their spokesman answered:
"We partake not of the bread and
wine of murderers, lest we should be
come of their fellowship. Al-Jebal,
we depart, but within a .week we re
appear again ki the company of ten
thousand spears, and on one of them
shall your head be set. Your safe
conduct guards us until the sunset,
After that, do your v.orat, as we do
ours. High princess, our counsel to
you is that you slay yourself and so
gain an immortal honor." Then; bow
ing to her one by one, they turned and
marched down the terrace followed by
their servants.
Now Sinan waved his hand and the
court broke up, Rosamund leaving it
first, accompanied by Masouda and es
corted by guards, after which Jfce
brethren were commarfaed to depart
also.
So they went, talking earnestly of
all these things, but finding no hope
save in God.
The Combat on the Bridge.
"Saladin will come," said Wulf the
hopeful, and from the high place where
he stood he pointed to the plain be
neath, across which a band of horse
men moved at full gallop. *'Look; yon
der goes his embassy."
"Aye," answered Godwin, "he will
come, but I fear me, too late."
"Yes, brother, unless we go to meet
him. Masouda has promised."
"Masouda," sighed Godwin. "Ahl to
think that so much should hang upon
the faithfulness of one woman."
"It does not hang on her," said Wulf:
"It hangs on fate, who writes with her
finger. Come, let us ride."
So, followed by their escort, they
'rode In the gardens, taking note, with
out seeming to do so, of the position
of the tall rock and of how it could be
approached from every side. Then they
went in again and waited for some
sign or word of Rosamund, but In vain.
That night there was no feast and
their meal was brought to them In
the guest-house. While they sat at It
Masouda appeared for a moment to tell
them that they had leave to ride the
bridge in the moonlight and that their
escort would await them at a certain
hour.
The brethren asked If their sister
Rosamund was not coming to dine
with them. Masouda answered that as
the queen-elect of the Al-Jebal it was
not lawful that she should eat with
any other men. even her brothers.
Then as she passed out, stumbling as
though by accident, she brushed
against Godwin and muttered:
"Remember, to-night," and was gone.
When the moon had been up an hour
the officer of their escort appeared and
led them to their horses, which were
waiting, and they rode away to the
castle bridge. As they approached It
they saw Lozelle departing on his
great black stallion, which was In a
lather of foam. It seemed that he also
had made trial of that perilous path,
for the people, of whom there were
many gathered there, clapped their
hands and shouted, "Well ridden,
Frank! well ridden!"
Now, Godwin leading on Flame, they
faced the bridge and walked, their
horses over It. Nor did these hang
back, although they snorted a little at
the black gulf on either side. Next
they returned at a trot, then over again
and yet again at a canter and a gal
lop, sometimes together and some
times singly. Lastly, Wulf made God
win halt in the middle of the bridge
and galloped down upon him at full
speed, till within a lance's length. Then
suddenly he checked his horse and,
while his audience shouted, wheeled it
around on Its hind legs, Its forehoofs
beating the air, and galloped back
again, followed by Godwin.
"AH went well," Wulf said as they
rode to the castle, "and nobler or more
gentle horses were never crossed by
men. I hare good hopes for to-mor
row night."
"Aye, brother, but I had no sword
in my hand. Be not overconfident,
for the man is desperate and a skilled
fighter, as I know who have stood
face to face with him. Moreover, his
black stallion is well trained, and has
more weight than ours. Also, yonder
Is a fearsome place on which to ride
a course, and one of which none but
the devil would have thought."
"I shall do my best," answered
Wulf, "and If I fall, why, then, act
upon your own counsel. At least, let
him not kill both of us."
Having stabled their horses the
brethren wandered into the garden,
â  and, avoiding the cup-bearing women
and the men they piled with their
drugged drink, drew by a roundabout

CHAPTER XIV.
road to the tall rock. Then, finding
themselves alone, they unlocked the
door, and, slipping through it, locked it
again on the farther side and groped
their way to the moonlit mouth of the
cave. Hero they stood awhile study
ing the descent of the gulf as best
they could in that light, till suddenly
Godwin, feeling a hand upon his
shoulder, started round to find him
self face to face with Masouda.
"How did you come?" he asked.
"By a road in which is your only
hope," slip answered. "Now, Sir God
win, waste no \Vords, for my time is
â hort, but if you think that you can
trust meâand this is for you to judge
âgive me the Signet which hangs
about your neck. If not, go back to
the castle and do your best to save
the lady Rosamund and yourselves."
Thrusting down his hand between
his mail shirt and his breast, Godwin
drew out the ancient ring, carved with
the- mysterious signs and veined with
the emblem of the dagger, and handed
it to Masouda.
"You trust indeed," she said with a
little laugh*, as. after scanning It
closely by the light of the moon and
touching her forehead with it, she
hid it In her bosom.
"Yes, lady," he answered, "I trust
you, though why you should risk so
much for us I do not know."
"Why? Well, perhaps for hate's
sake, for Sinan does not rule by
love; .erhaps because, being of a
wild blood, I am willing to set
my life at hazar" who care
not if I win or die; perhaps
because you saved m.c from the
lioness. What is it to you, Sir God
win, why a certain woman-spy of the
Assassins, whom In your land you
would spit on, chooses to do this or
that?"
She ceased and stood before them
with heaving breast and flashing eyes,
a mysterious white figure in the moon
light, most beautiful to see.
Godwin felt his heart stir and the
blood flow to his brow, but before he
could speak Wulf broke in. saying:
"You bade us spare words, lady
Masouda. so tell us, what we must do."
'â¢This." she answered, becoming
calm again. "To-morrow night about
this hour you fight Lozelle upon the
TORN
narrow path. That is certain, for all
the city talks of it, and, whatever
chances, Al-Jebal will not deprive
them of the spectacle of this fray to
the death. Well, you may fall,
though that man at heart is a coward,
which you are not, for here courage
alone will avail nothing, but rather
skill and horsemanship and trick of
war. If so, then Sir Godwin fights
him, and of this business none can
tell the end. Should both of you go
down, then I will do my best to save
your lady and take her to Salah
ed-din, with whom she will be safe, or
If I cannot save her I will find her
a means to save herself by death."
"You swear that?" said Wulf.
"I have said it, it is enough," she
answered Impatiently.
"Then I face the bridge and the
knave Lozelle with a light heart," said
Wulf again, and Masouda went on:
"Now if you conquer, Sir Wulf, or
if you fall and your brother conquers,
both of youâor one of you. as it may
happenâmust gallop back at full
speed toward the stable gate that lies
more than a mile from the castle
bridge. Mounted as you are. no horse
can keep pace with you, nor must you
stop at the gate, but ride on, ride like
the wind till you reach this place. The
gardens will bp empty of feasters and
cup-bearers, who with every soul
within the city will have gathered on
the walls and on the housetops to see
the fray. There is but one fearâby
then a guard may be set before this
mound, seeing that Salah-ed-dln has
declared war upon Al-Jebal, and
though yonder road is known to few,
It is a road, and sentries may watch
here. If so, you must cut them down
or be cut down and bring your story
to an end. Sir Godwin, here is an
other key that you may use if you are
alone. Take it."
He did so, and Masouda continued:
"Now if both of you, or one of you,
win through to this cave enter with
your horses, lock the door, bar it and
wait. It may be I will Join you here
with the Princess. But if I do hot come
by the dawn and you are not discov
ered and overwhelmedâwhich should
not be, seeing that one man can hold
that door against manyâthen know
that the worst has happened and fly to
Salah-ed-din and tell him of this road,
by which he may take vengeance upon
his foe Slnan. Only then, I pray you,
doubt not that I have done my best,
who if I fall must dieâmost horribly.
Now, farewell until we meet again orC
do not meet again. Go, you know the
road."
They turned to obey, but when they
had gone a few paces Godwin looked
round and saw Masouda watching
them. The moonlight fell full upon her
face and by it he saw also that tears
were running from her dark and tender
eyes. Back he came again, and with
him Wulf, for that sight drew them.
Down he bent before her till bis knee
touched the ground, and taking her
hand he kissed it and said in a gentle
voice:
"Henceforth through life, through
death, we serve two ladies," and what
he did Wulf did also.
"Mayhap," she answered sadly; "two
ladiesâbut one love."
Then they went. and creeping
through the bushes to the path wan
dered about awhile among the revelers
and came to the guest house safely.
Once more it was night, and high
above the mountain fortress of Masyaf
shone the full summer moon, lighting
crag and tower as with some vast sil
ver lamn. Forth from the guest house
rode the brethren, side by side, upon
their splendid steeds, and the moon
rays sparkled upon their coats of mail,
their polished bucklers, blazoned with
the cognizance of a grinning skull, their
close-fitting helms and the points of the
long tough lances that had been given
them. Round them rode their escort,
while In front and behind went a mob
of people.
The nation of the Assassins had
thrown off its gloom this night, for
the while It was no longer oppressed
even by the fear of attack from its
mighty foe, Saladin. To death it was
accustomed; death was its watchword;
death in many dreadful forms its daily
bread. Prom the walls of Masyaf, day
by day, fedais went out to murder this
great one, or that great one. at the bid
ding of their lord Slnan. For the most
part they came not back again; they
waited week by week, month by
month, year by year, till the moment
was ripe, then gave the poisoned cup
or drove home the dagger, and escaped
or were slain. Death waited them
abroad, and if they failed, death wait
ed them at home. The dreadful caliph
was himself a sword of death. At his
will they hurled themselves from tow
ers or .from precipices; to satisfy his
policy they sacrificed their wives and
children. And their rewardâiht life,
the drugged cup and- voluptuous
dreams; after it, as thejr believed, a
still more voluptuous paradise.
A.l forms of human agony and doom
were known to this people; but now
they were promised an unfamiliar
sight, that of Frankish knights slaying
each other in single combat beneath
the silent moon, tilting at full gallop
upon a narrow place where many
might hesitate to walk, andâoh, Joy!-*
--falling perchance, horse and rider to
gether, into the depths below. So they
were happy, for to them this was a
night of festival, to be followed by a
morrow of still greater festival, when
their sultan and their god took to him
se'.f this stranger beauty as a wife.
Doubtless. â  too, he would soon weary
of her. and they would be called to
gether to see her cast from some top
most tower and hear her frail bones
break on the cruel rocks below, orâ
as had happened to the last queenâ
to watch her writhe out her life in
the pangs of poison upon a charge of
Borcery. It was indeed a night of fes
tival, a night filled full of promise of
rich joys to come.
On rode the brethren, with, stern, im
passive faces, but wondering in their
hearts whether they would live to see
another dawn. The shouting crowd
surged round them, breaking
through the circle of their
guards. A hand was thrust up
to Godwin; in it was a let
ter, which he took and read by the
bright moonlight. It was written in
English, and brief:
"I cannot speak with you. Gcd be
with you both, my brothers. God and
the spirit of my father. Strike home,
Wulf, strike home. Godwin, and fear
not for me who will guard myself. Con
quer or die, and in life or death, await
me To-morrow in the flesh, or in the
spirit, we will talkâRosamund."
Godwin handed the paper to Wulf.
and, as he did so, saw that the guards
had caught its bearer, a withered,
gray-haired woman. They asked her
some questions, but she shook her
head. Then they cast her down,
trampled the life out of her beneath
their horses' hoofq, a3f went on laugh
ing. The mob laughed also.
"Tear that paper up, said Godwin.
Wulf did so, saying:
"Our Rosamund has a brave heart.
Well, wo are of the same blood, and
will not fail her."
Now they were come to the open
space in front of the narrow bridge,
where, tier on tier, the multitude were
ranged, kept back from its center'by
lines of guards. On the flat roofed
houses also they were crowded thick
as swarming bees, on the circling walls
and on the battlements that protected
the far end of the bridge, and the
houses of the outer cltv. Before the
bridge was a low gateway, and upon
Its roof sat the Al-Jebal, clad in his
scarlet robe of festival, and by his
side, the moonlight gleaming on her
jewels, Rosamund. In front, draped
In a rich garment, a dagger of gems
In her dark hair, stood the Interpreter
or "mouth" Maaonda, and behind were
dale and guards.
The brethren rode to the spaoe be
fore the arch and halted, saluting with
.Hieir Mnacmed speara. Then from
the farther side approached another
procession, which, opening, revealed
the Knight Lozelle riding on his great
black horse, and a huge man and a
fierce he seemed in his armor.
"What!" he shouted, glowering at
them. "Am I to fight one against two?
Is this your chivalry?"
"Nay, nay, Sir Traitor," answered
Wulf. "Nay, nay, betrayer of Chris
tian maids to the power of the heathen
dog; you have fought Godwin, now it
is the turn of Wulf. Kill Wulf and
Godwin remains. Kill Godwin and
God remains. Knave, you look your
last upon the moon."
Lozelle heard, and seemed to go
mad with rage, or fear, or both.
"Lord Sinan," he shouted In Arable,
"this Is murder. Am I, who have done
you so much service, to be murdered
for pleasure by the lovers of
that woman, whom you would honor
with the name of wife?"
Sinan heard, and stared at him with
dull, angry eyes,
"Aye, you may stare," went on ths
maddened Lozelle, "but it is true â
they are her lovers, not her brothers.
Would men take so much pains for a
sister's sake, think you? Would they
swim Into this net of yours for a sis
ter's sake?"
â¢Slnan held up his hand for silence.
"Let the lots be cast," he said, "for
whatever these men are, this fight
must go on, and it shall be fair."
So a dai, standing by himself, cast
lots upon the ground, and having read
them, announced Lozelle must run tho
tirst course of the farther .ide of the
bridge. Then one took his bridle to
ltad him across. As he passed the
brethren he grinned in their faces and
said: , ,
"At least this sure, you also look
your last upon the moon. I am
avenged already. - The bait that
hooked me is a meal for yonder pike,
and he will kill you both before her
eyes to sharp his appetite."
But the brethren answered nothing.
The black horse of Lozelle grew dim
In the distance of the moonlit bridge,
and vanished beneath the farther
archway that led to the other City.
Then a herald cried, Masouda trans
lating his words, which another herald
echoed from beyond the gulf.
"Thrice will the trumpets blow. At
the third blast of the trumpets the
knights shall charge and meet In the
certer of the bridge. Thenceforward
they may fight as it pleases them,
ahorse, or afoot, with lance, with
sword, or with dagger, but to the Van
quished no mercy will be shown. If
he be brought Jiving from the bridge,
living he shall be cast into the gulf.
Hear the decree of Al-Jebal!"
Then Wulf's horse was led forward
to the entrance to the bridge, and
from the farther side was le4 forward
the horse of Lozelle.
"Good luck, brother," said Godwin,
as he passed him. Would that I rode
this course Instead of you."
"Your turn may come, brother,"
answered the grim Wulf, as he set his
lance in rest.
Now from some neighboring tower
peeled out the first long blast of trum
pets and dead silence fell on all the
multitude. Grooms came forward to
look to girth and bridle and stirrup,
but Wulf waved them back.
"I mind my own harness," he said.
The second blast blew and 'he
loosened the great sword In Its scab
bard, the sword that hud flamed In his
forbear's hand upon the turrets of
Jerusalem.
"Your gift." he cried back to Rosa*mund, and her answer came clear and
sweet:
"Bear It like your fathers, Wulf.
Bear it as it was last borne In the hall
at Steeple."
Then there was another silence âa.
silence long and deep. Wulf looked
at the white and narrow ribbon of
â¢ the bridge, looked at the black gulf
on either side, looked at the blue sky
Ã¼bove, in which flouted the great globe
of the golden moon. Then he leaned
forward and patted Smoke upon the
neck. â¢
For the third time the trumpets
" blew, and from either end of that
bridge, two' hundred paces long, the
knights flashed toward each other like
living bolts of steel. The multitude
. rose to watch; even Sinan rose. Only
Rosamund sat still, gripping the
cushion with her hands. Hollow rang
the hoofs of the horses upon the
stonework, swifter and swifter they
flew, lower and lower bent the knights
upon their saddles. Now they were
near, and now they met. The spears
seemed to shiver, the horses to hustle
together on the narrow way and over
hang its edge, then on came the black
horse toward the inner city, and on
sped Smoke toward the further gulf.
"They have passed! They have
passed!" roared the multitude.
Look! Lozelle approached, reeling In
his saddle, as well he might, for the
helm was torn from his head and blood
poured from his skull where the lance
had grazed It.
"Too high. Wulf; too high," said
Godwin sadly. "But, oh, If those laces
had but held!"
. Soldiers caught the horse and turned
It.
"Another helm!" cried Lozelle.
"Nay," answered Stnam; "yonder
-knight has lost his shield. New lances
âthat Is all."
So they gave him a fresh lance and,
presently, at the blast of the trumpets,
again the horses were seen speeding
together over the narrow way. They
met, and lo! Lozelle, torn from his
saddle, but still clinging to the reins,
was flung backward, far backward, to
fall on the stonework of the bridge.
Down, too, beneath the mighty shock
went his black horse, a huddled heap,
and lay there struggling.
"WUlf will fall over him!" cried
Rosamund. But Smoke did not fall;
the stallion gathered Itself togetherâ
the moonlight shone so clear that every
watcher saw Itâand since stop it could
not, leaped straight over the fallen
black horseâaye, and over the rider
beyondâand 6ped on in its stride. Then
the black found its feet again and gal
loped forward to the farther gate and
Lozelle also found his feet and turned
to run.
"Stand! Stand, coward!" yelled ten
thousand voices and, hearing them, he
drew his sword and stood.
Within three great strides Wulf
dragged his charger to Its haunches,
then wheeled it round.
"Charge him!" shouted the multitude,
but he remained seated, as though un
willing to attack a horseless man. Next
he sprang from his saddle and, accom
panied by the horse Smoke, which fol
lowed him as a dog follows its master,
walked slowly toward Lozelle, as he
walked casting away his lance and
drawing the great, cross-hilted sword.
Again the silence fell and through It
rang the cry of Godwin:
"A D'Arcy! A D'Arcy!"
"A D'Arcy! A D'Arcy!" came back
Wuirs answer from the bridge and his
voice echoed thin and hollow in the
spaces of the gulf. Yet they rejoiced
to hear St, for it told them that he was
sound a"d strong.
Wulf ha<! :io shield and Lozelle had
no helmâthe ftght was even. They
crouched opposite each other, the
sword flashed aloft in the moonlight;
(iron] far away came the distant clank
of steel, a soft, continual clamor of Iron
i n Iron. A blow fell on Wulfs mail,
who had naught wherewith to guard
himself, uvd he staggered back. An
other blow, another and another, and
ba< k. still back he reeled âback to the
edge of the bridge, back until he struck
against the horse that stood behind
him, and, resting there a moment, as
it seemed, regained his balance.
Then there was a change. Look, he
rushed forward, wielding the great
blade in both hands. The stroke lit up
on Lozelle's shield and seemed to tear
it in two, for in that stillness all could
hear the clang of its upper half as it
fell upon the stones. Beneath the
weight of it he staggered, sank to his
knee, gained his feet again, and in his
turn gave back. Yes, now it was Lo
zelle who rocked and reeled. Aye, by
St. Chad! Lozelle who went down be
neath that mighty blow which missed
the head but fell upon bis shoulder,
and lay there like a log, till presently
the moonlight shone upon his mailed
hand stretched upward In a prayer
for mercy. From house top, terrace,
and wall, from soaring gates and bat
tlements, the multitude of the people
of the Assassins gathered on their
side' the gulf broke into a roar that
beat up the mountain sides like a voice
of thunder. And the roar shaped itself
to these words:
"Kill him! kill him! kill him!"
Sinan held up his hand, and a sud
den silence fell. Then he, too, screamed
in his thin voice:
"Kill him! He is conquered!"
But the great Wulf only leaned upon
the cross handle of his brand, and
looked at the fallen foe. Presently, he
seemed to speak with him; then Lo
seile lifted the blade that lay beside
him and gave it to him in token of
surrender. Wulf handled it awhile,
Ehook It on high In triumph, and
Whirled it about his head till it shone
In the moonlight. Next, with a shout
he cast it from him far Into the gulf,
where it was seen for a moment, an arc
of gleaming light, and the next was
gone.
Now, taking no more heed of the con
quered knight, Wulf turned and began
to walk toward his horse.
Scarely was his back toward him
when Lozelle was on his feet again, a
dagger In his hand.
"Look behind you!" yelled Godwin.
But the spectators, pleased that the
fight was not yet done, broke Into a
.roar of cheers. Wulf heard and swung
around. As he faced Lozelle the dag
.ger struck him on his breast, and well
must It have been for him that his mail
was good. To use his sword he had
neither space nor time, but ere the next
stroke could fall his arms were about
Lozelle and the fight for life began.
To and fro they reeled and staggered,
whirling round and round, till none of
them could tell which of them was
Wulf or which hjs foe. Now they were
oh the edge of the abyss, and in that
last dread strain for mastery seemed
to stand there still as stone. Then one
man began to bend down. See! his
head hung over. Further and further
he bent, but his arms could not be
loosened.
"They will both go!" cried the multi
tude In their Joy.
Look! A dagger flashed. Once, twice,
thrice it gleamed, and those wrestlers
fell apart, while from deep down In the
gulf came the thud of a fallen body.
"Whichâoh, which?" cried Rosa
mund from her battlement.
"Sir Hugh Lozelle," answered God
win in a solemn voice.
Then the head of Rosamund fell for
ward on her breast and for a while she
seemed to sleep.
Wulf went to his horse, turned it
about on the bridge and throwing his
arm around Its neck rested for a space.
Then he mounted and walked slowly
toward the Inner gate. Pushing
through the guard and officers Godwin
rode out to meet him.
"Bravely done, brother," he said,
when they came face to face. "Say, are
you hurt?"
"Bruised and shakenâno more," an
swered Wulf.
"A good beginning truly. Now for
the rest," said Godwin. Then ho
glanced over bis shoulder and added.
"See, they are leading Rosamund
away, but Sinan remains, to speak
with you, doubtless, for Masouda
beckons."
â¢What shall we do?" asked Wulf.
"Make a plan, brother, for my head
swims."
"Hear what he has to say. Then as
your horse is not wounded either, ride
for it when I give the signal as Ma
souda bade us. There Is no other
way. Pretend that you are somewhat
hurt."
So, Godwin leading, while the mul
titude roared a welcome to the con
yuering Wulf who had borne himself
so bravely for their pleasure, they
rode to the mouth of the bridge and
halted In the little space before the
archway. There Al-Jebal spoke by
Masouda.
"A noble fray," he said. "I did not
think that Franks could fight so well.
Say, Sir Knight, will you feast with
me in my palace?"
"I thank you, lord," answered Wulf,
"but I must rest while my brother
tends my hurts," and he pointed to
blood upon his mail. "To-morrow, If
It pleases you."
Slnan stared at them and btroked
his beard, while they trembled, wait
ing for the word of fate.
It came.
"Good. So be it. To-morrow I wed
the lady Rose of Roses, and you two
âher brothers âshall give her to me,
as is fitting," and he sneered. "Then
also you shall receive the reward of
valorâa great reward, I promise you."
While he spoke Godwin, staring up
ward, had noted a little wandering
cloud floating across the mooff. (Slowly
it covered it and the place grew dim.
"Now," he whispered, and bowing
to Al-Jebal,. they pushed their horses
through the open gate when the meb
closed in on them, thus for a little
while holding back the escort from
following on their heels. They spoke
to Flame and Smoke and the good
horses plunged onward side by side,
separating the crowd as the prows of
boats separate the water. In ten
paces it grew thin, in thirty it was be
hind them, for all folk were gathered
about the archway where they could
see, and none beyond. Forward they
cantered till the broad road turned to
the left and in that faint light they
were hidden.
"Away!" said Godwin, shaking his
reins.
Forward leaped the horses at speed.
Again Godwin turned, taking that road
which ran round the city wall and
through the gardens, leaving the
guest castle to the left, whereas their
escort followed that whereby they had
come, thinking that they were ahead
of them. Three minutes more and they
were in the lonely gardens, in which
that night no women wandered and
no neophytes dreamed in the pavilion:
"Wulf," said Godwin, as they swept
forward, skimming the turf like swal
lows, "draw your sword and be ready.
Remember the secret cave may be
guarded, and, if so, we must kill or be
killed."
Wulf nodded, and the next instant
two long blades flashed in the moon
light, for the little cloud had passed
away. Within a hundred paces of them
rose the tall rock, but between it and
the mound were two mounted guards.
They heard the beating of horses'
hoofs, and wheeling about, stared to
see two armed knights sweeping down
upon them like a whirlwind. They
called to them to stop, hesitating, then
rode forward a few paces, as though
wondering whether this were not a
vision.
In a moment the brethren were on
them. . The soldiers lifted their lances,
but ere they could thrust the sword
of Godwin had caught one between the
neck and shoulder and sunk to his
breast bone, while the sword of Wulf
used as a spear, had pierced the oth
er through and through, so that those
men fell dead by the door of the
mound, never knowing who had slain
them.
The brethren pulled up on .their
bridles and spoke to Flame and
Smoke, halting them within a score of
yards.
Then they wheeled round and sprang
from their saddles. One of the dead
guards still held his horse's reins, and
the other beast stood by snorting.
Gcdwin caught it before it stirred,
then, holding all four of them, threw
the key to Wulf and bade him unlock
the door. Soon it was done, although
he staggered at the task; then he held
the horses, while one by one, Godwin
led them In, and that without trouble,
for the beasts thought that this was
but a cave-hewn stable of a kind to
which they were accustomed.
"What of the dead men?" said Wulf.
"They had best keep us company,"
answered Godwin; and, running out,
he carried in first one and then the
other.
"Swift!" he said, as he threw down
the second corpse. "Shut the door.
I caught sight of horsemen riding
through the trees. Nay, the> saw
nothing."
So they locked the massive door and
waited in the dark, expecting every
moment to hear soldiers battering at
its timbers. But no sound came; the
searchers, if such they were, had
passed on to seek elsewhere.
Now while Wulf made shift to fas
ten up the horses at the mouth of the
cave, Godwin gathered stones as
large as he could lift, and piled them
up against the door, till they knew
that it would take many men an hour
or more to break through. For this
door was banded with iron and set
fast in the living rock.
CHAPTER XV.
The Flight to Emosa.
Then came the weariest time of
waiting the brethren had ever known,
or were to know, although at first they
did not feel it so long and heavy.
Water trickled down the walls of this
cave, and Wulf, who was parched with
thirst, gathered It in his hands and
drank till he was satisfied. Then he
let It run upon his head to cool its
aching; and Godwin bathed such of
his brother's hurts and bruises as
could be come at, for he did not dare
to remove the hauberk, and so gave
him comfort.
When this was done, and he had
looked to the saddles and trappings
of the horses, Wulf told of all that
had passed between him and'Lozelle
on the bridge. How at the first onset
his spear had caught in the links of
and. torn away the headpiece of his
foe, who if the lacings had not burst
would have been hurled to death,
while that of Lozelle struck his
buckler fair and shattered on it, rend
ing it from his arm. How they
pushed past each other, and for a mo
ment the fore hoofs of Smoke hung
over the abyss, so that he thought he
was surely sped. How at the next
course Lozelle's spear passed be
neath his arm. while his. strikinjc full
upon Sir Hugh's breast, brought down
the black horse and his rider as
though a thunderbolt had smitten
him, and how Smoke, that could not
check its furious pace, leaped over
them, as a horse leaps a-hunt
ing. How he would not rido
down Lozelle, but dismounted to
finish the fray in knightly fashion,
and, being shieldless, received the
full weight of the great sword
upon his mail, so that he staggered
back and would have fallen had hs
not struck against the horse.
Then Wulf told of the blows that
followed, and of his last that wounded
Lozelle, shearing through his mall and
felling him as an ox is felled by the
butcher; how, also, when ho sprang
forward to kill him, this mighty and
brutal man had prayed for mercyâ
prayed it in the name of Christ and
of their own mother, whom as a child
he knew in Essex. How he could not
butcher him, being; helpless, but
turned away, saying that he left him
to be dealt with by Al-Jebal, whereon
this traitorous dog sprang up and
strove to poniard him. He told, also,
of their last fearful struggle, and hoy*
shaken as he was by the blow upon his
back, although the point of the dagger
had not pierced his mail, he strove
with Lozelle, man to man, till at
length his youth, great natural
strength and the skill ho had In
wrestling, learned in many a village
bout at home, enabled him to prevail,
and, while they hung together on the
perilous edge of the gulf, to free his
right hand, draw his poniard and
make an end.
"Yet." added Wulf. "never shall I
forget the look of that man's eye as
he fell backward, or the whistling
scream which came from his pierced
throat.'"
"At least there is a.rogue the less In
the world, although he was a brave
one In his own knavish fashion," an
swered Godwin. "Moreover, my broth
er," he added, placing his arm about
Wulfs nfck. "I am glad It fell to you
to fight him, for at the last grip your
might overcame, where I, who am not
so strong, should have failed. Further,
I think you did well to show mercy, as
a good knight should, that thereby you
have gained great honor and that, if
his spirit can see through the dark
ness, our dead uncle is proud of you
now, as I am, my brother."
"I thank you," replied Wulf simply;
"but in this hour of torment, who can
think of such things as honor gained
or lost?"
Then, lest he should grow stiff, who
was sorely bruised beneath his mail,
they began to walk up and down the
cave from where the horses stood to
where the two dead Assassins lay by
the door, the faint light gleaming upon
their stern, dark features. 11l company
they seemed in that silent, lonely
place.
The time crept on; Â«the moon sank
toward the mountains.
"What if they do not come?" asked
Wulf.
"Let us wait to think of it till dawn."
answered Godwin.
Again they walked the length of the
cave and back.
"How can they come, the door being
barred?" asked Wulf.
"How did Masouda come and go?"
answered Godwin. "Oh, question me
no moi'e; it is in the hand of God."
"Look," said Wulf, in a whisper.
"Who stand yonder at the end of the
caveâthere by the dead men?"
"Their spirits, perchance,"-answered
Godwin, drawing his sword and lean
ing forward. Then .he looked and, true
enough, there stood' two figures faintly
outlined In the gloom. They glided
toward them and now the level moon
light shone upon their white robes and
gleamed in the gems they wore.
"I cannot see them," said a voice.
"Oh. those dead soldiers âwhat do they
portend?"
"At least yonder stand their horses,"
answered another voice.
Now the brethren guessed the truth
and, like men in a dream, stepped for
ward from the shadow of the wall.
"Rosamund!" they said.
"Oh. Godwin! oh. Wulf!" she cried
In answer. "O Jesu, I thank Thee,
I thank TheeâThee and this brave
woman!" and. casting her arms about
Masouda, she kissed her on the face.
Masouda pushed hr-r back, and said,
in a voice that was almost harsh:
"It is not fitting, princess, that your
pure lips should touch the cheek of a
woman of the Assassins."
But Rosamund would not bo ro
pulsed.
"It Is most fitting-," she sobbed, "that
I should give you thanks who but for
you must also become a woman of the
Assassins, or an Inhabitant of the
House of Death."
Then Masouda kused her back, and
thrusting her away into the arms of
Wulf, said roughly:
"So, pilgrims Peter and John, your
patron saints have brought you
through so far; and, John, you fight
right well. Nay, do not stop for our
story, if you wish us to live to tell It.
What! You have the soldiers' horses
with your own? Well done! I did not
credit you with so much wit. Now,
Fir Wulf, can you walk? Yes; so much
the better; it will save you a rough
ride, for this place Is steep, though not
so steep as one you know of. Now,
set the princess upon Flame, for no
cat Is surer footed than that horse,
as you may remember, Peter. I who
know the path will lead It. John, take
you the other two; Peter, do you fol
low last of all with Smoke, and, if
they hang back, prick them with your
sword. Come, Flame, be not afraid.
Flame. Where I go, you can come,"
and Masouda thrust her way through
the bushes and over the edge of the
cliff, talking to the snorting horse and
patting its neck.
A minute more, and they were
scrambling down a mountain ridge so
steep that it seemed as though they
must fall and be dashed to pieces at
the bottom. Yet, they fell not, for,
made as it had been to meet such
hours of need, this road was safer than
It appeared with ridges cut In the rock
at the worst places.
Down they went, and down, till at
length, panting, but safe, they stood
at the bottom of the darksome gulf
where only the starlight shone, for
here the rays of the low moon could
not reach.
"Mount," said Masouda. "Princess,
stay you on Flame; he is the surest
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALU
and the swiftest. Sir Wulf, keep your
own horse Smoke; your brother and
I will ride those of the soldiers.
Though not very swift, doubtless they
are good beasts and accustomed to
such roads." Then she leaped to the
saddle as a woman born in the desert
can, and pushed her horse in front.
For a mile or more Masouda led them
along the rocky bottom of the gulf,
where because of the stones they could
only travel at a foot pace, till they
came to a deep cleft on the left hand,
up which they began to ride. By now
the moon was quite behind the moun
tains, and such faint light as came
from the stars began to be obscured;
with drifting clouds. Still, they stum
bled on till they reached a little glade
where water ran and grass grew.
"Halt," said Masouda. "Here we
must wait till dawn, for in this dark
ness the horses cannot keep their foot
ing on the stones. Moreover, all about
us lie precipices, over one of which we
might fall."
"But they will pursue us," pleaded
Rosamund.
"Not until they have light to see by."
answered Masouda, "6r at least we
must take the risk, for to go forward
would be madness. Sit down and rest
a while, and let the horses drink a
little and eat a mouthful of grass.
holding their reins In our hands, for we
and they must need all our strength
before to-morrow's sun is set. Sir
Wulf, say, are you much hurt?"
"But very little," he answered in a
cheerful voice; "a few bruises beneath
my mail âthat Is all, for Lozelle's sword
was heavy. Tell us, I pray you, what
happened after we rode away from the
castle bridge?"
"This, knights. The princess, here,
being overcome, was escorted by the
slaves back to her chambers, but Si
nan bade me stay with him awhile
that he might speak to you through
me. Do you know what was in his
mind? To have you killed at once,
both of you, whom Lozelle had told
him were this lady's lovers, and not
her brothers. Only he feared that
there might be trouble with the peo
ple, who were pleased with the fight
ing, so held his hand. Then he bade
you to the supper, whence you would
not have returned; but when Sir Wulf
said that he was hurt, 1 I whispered to
him that what he wished to do could
best be done on the morrow at the
wedding feast when he was In his own
halls, surrounded by his guards. 'Aye,'
he answered, 'these brethren shall fight
with them until they are driven into
the gulf. It will be a goodly sight for
me and my queen to see.'"
"Oh, horrible! horrible!" said Rosa
mund, while Godwin muttered:
"I swear that I would have fought
not with his guards, but with Slnan
only."
"So he suffered you to go, and I left
him also. Before I went he spoke to
me. bidding me bring the Princess to
him privately within two hours after
he had supped, as he wished to speak
to her alone about the ceremony of her
marriage on the morrow and to make
her gifts. I answered aloud that his
commands should be obeyed and hur
ried to the guest castle. There I found
your lady recovered from her falntness,
but mad with fear, and forced her to
eat and drink.
"The rest is short. Before the two
hours were gone a messenger came
saying that the Al-Jebal bade me do
what he had commanded.
" 'Return,' I answered; 'the Princess
adorns herself. We follow presently
alone, as It is commanded.'
"Then I threw this cloak about her
and bade her be brave, and If we failed
to choose whether she would take Sinan
or death for lord. Next I took the ring
you hadâthe signet of the dead Al-
Jebal, who gave it to your kinsman,
and held It before the slaves, who
bowed and let me pass. We came to
the guards, and to them again I showed
the ring. They Dowea also. Dut wnen
they saw that we turned down the
passage to the left, and not to the
right, as we should have done to come
to the doors of the.lnner palace, they
would have stopped us.
" 'Acknowledge the signet,' I an
swered. 'Dogs, what is it to you which
road the signet takes V Then they also
let me pass.
"Now, following the passage, we were
out of the guest house and in the gar
dens, and I led her to what Is called
the prison tower, whence runs the se
cret way. Here were more guards,
whom I bade open in the name of Sl
nan. They said: 'We obey not. This
place is shut save to the signet itself.'
" 'Behold it,' I answered. The officer
looked and saldr"Tt Is the very signet,
sure enough, and there is no other.
Yet he paused, studying the black
stone veined with the red dagger and
the ancient writing on it.
" 'Are you, then, weary of lifer I
asked. 'Fool, the Al-Jebal himself
would keep a tryst within this house,
which he enters secretly from the pal
ace. Woe to you if ho does not find
his lady there!'
" 'It is the signet that he must havo
sent, sure enough,' the captain said
again, 'to disobey which Is death.'
" 'Aye, open, open,' whispered his
companions.
"So they opened, though doubtful
ly, and we entered, and I barred the
door behind us. Then, to be short,
through the darkness of the tower
basement, guiding ourselves by the
wall, we crept to the entrance of that
way of which I know the secret Aye,
and along all Its length and through
the rock door of escape at the end of
which I set so that none can turn it,
save skilled masons with their tools,
and into the cave where we found you.
It was no great matter, having the
signet, although without the signet It
had not been possible to-night, when
every gate is guarded."
"No great matter!" gasped Rosa
mund. "Oh, Godwin and Wulf! If you
know how she had thought of. and
made ready for everything; If you
could have seen how all those cruel
men glared at us, searching out our
very souls! If you could have heard
how high she answered them, waving
that ring before their eyes and bid
ding them to obey Its presence, or to
die!"
"Which they surely have done by
now," broke In Masouda quietly,
"though I do not pity them, who were
wicked. Nay; thank me not; I have
done what I promised to do, neither
less nor more, and âI love danger and
a high stake. Tell us your story. Sir
Godwin."
So, seated there on the grass in the
darkness, he told them of their mad
ride and of the slaying- of the guards,
â while Rosamund raised her hands and
thanked heaven for its mercies and
that they were without those accursed
walls.
"You may be within them again be
fore sunset," said Masouda grimly.
"Yes," answered Wulf, "but not
alive. Now what plan have you? To
ride for the coast towns?"
"No," replied Masouda; "at least
not straight, since to do so we must
pass through the country of the As
sassins, who by this day's light will be
warned to watch for us. We must
ride through the desert mountains
lands to Emesa, fifty miles away, and
cross the Orontes there, then down
into Baalbec, and so back to Beirut."
"Emesa?" said Godwin, "Why Sal
adln holds that place and of Baalbeo
the lady Rosamund is Princess."
"Which is best?" asked Masouda
shortly. "That she should fall into the
hands of Salah-ed-din, or back into
those of the master of the Assassins?
Choose which you wish."
"I choose Salah-ed-din," broke In
Rosamund, "for at least he Is my uncle
and will do me no wrong." Nor, know
ing the case desperate, did the others
gainsay her.
Now at length the summer day began
to break and while it was still too
dark to travel, Godwin and Rosamund
let the horses graze, holding them by
the bridles. Masouda, also, taking off
the hauberk of Wulf, doctored his
bruises as best she could with tho
crushed leaves of a bush that grow
by the stream, having first washed
them with water and, though the time
was short, thus eased him much. Then,
so soon as the dawn was gray, having
drunk their fill and, as they had noth
ing else, eaten some watercress that
grew in the stream, they tightened
their 6addlegirths and started. Scarce
ly had they gone a hundred yards
when, from the gulf beneath, that was
hidden In gray mists, they heard ths
sound of horses' hoofs and men's
voices.
"Push on," said Masouda, "Al-Jebal
Is on our track."
Upward they climbed through the
gathering light, skirting the edge of
dreadful precipices which, in the gloom.
It would have been impossible to pass,
till at 'length they reached a great
tableland that ran to the foot of some
mountains a dozen miles or more away.
Among those mountains soared two
peaks, set close together. To these
Masouda pointed, saying that their
road ran between them and that be
yond lay the valley of the Orontes.
While she spoke, far away behind
them they heard the sound of men
shouting, although they could see noth
ing because of the dense mist.
"Push on," said Masouda; "there is
no time to spare," and they went for
ward, but only at a hand gallop, for
the ground was still rough and the
light uncertain.
When they had covered some six
miles of the distance between then?'
snd the mountain pass, the sun rose
suddenly and sucked up the mist.
This was what they saw. Before them
lay a fiat, sandy plain; behind, the
stony ground that they had traversed,
and riding over it, two miles or so
away, some twenty men of the Assas
sins,
"They cannot catch us," said Wulf;
but Masouda pointed to the right,
where the mist still hung, and said:
"Yonder I see spears."
Presently It thinned, and there a
league from them they saw a great
body of mounted soldiers âperhaps
there were four hundred.
"Look," she said, "they have come
round during the night, as I feared
they would. Now we must cross tile
pass before them or be taken." and
she struck her horse fiercely with a
stick that she had cut at the stream.
Half a mile further on a shout from
a great body of men to their fight,
which was answered by another shout
from those behind, told them that they
were seen.
"On!" said Masouda. "The race will
be close." So they began to gallop
their best.
Two miles were done, but although
that behind was far away, the great
cloud of dust to their right grew ever
nearer till it seemed as though it must
reach the mouth of the mountain pass
before them. Then Godwin spoke. '
"Wulf and Rosamund, ride on. Your
horses are swift and can outpace them.
At the crest of the mountain pass wait
a while to breathe the beasts, and see
If we come. If not, ride on again, and
God be with you."
"Aye," said Masouda, "ride and head
for the Emesa bridgeâit can be seen
from far awayâand there yield your
selves to the officers of Salah-ed-din."
They hung back, but in a stern volcO
Godwin repeated:
"Ride, I command you both."
"For Rosamund's sake, so be tt." an
swered Wulf. Then he called to Smoke
and Flame, and they stretched them
selves out unon the sand and passed
away swifter than swallows. Soon
Godwin and Masouda. toiling behind,
saw them enter the mouth of the
pass.
"Good," she said. "Except those of
their own breed, there are no horses
in Syria than can catch those two.
They will come to Emesa, have no
fear."
"Who was the man that brought
them to us?" asked Godwin, as they
galloped side by side, their eves fixed
upon the ever-nearing cloud of dust.
In which the spear points sparkled.
"My father's brotherâmy uncle, as
I called him," she answered. "He Is a
shlek of the desert, who owns the an
cient breed that cannot be bought for
gold."
"Then you are not of the Assassins,
Masouda?"
"No; I only tell you, now that the
end seems near. My father was air
Arab, my mother a noble Frank, a
French woman, whom he found starv
ing in the desert after a fight, and took
to his tent and made his wife. The
Assassins fell upon us and killed him
and her. and captured me, a child of
12. Afterward, when I grew older, be
ing beautiful in those days, I was
taken to the harem of Sinan, and, al
though in secret I had been bred up a
Christian by my mother, they swore me
of his accursed faith. Now you will
understand why I hate him so sorely
who murdered my father and my
mother, and made me what I am; why
I hold myself so vile also. Yes, I have
been forced to serve as his spy or bo
killed, who, although he believed me
his faithful slave, desired first to bo
avenged upon him."
"I do not hold you vile." panted God
win, as he spurred his laboring steed.
"I hold you most noble."
"I rejoice to hear it before we die,"
she answered, looking him in the eyes
in such a fashion that he dropped his
head before her burning gaze, "who
hold you dear, Sir Godwin, for whose
sake I have dared these things, al
though lam nought to you. Nay,
speak not; the lady Rosamund has
told me all that storyâexcept Its an
swer."
Now they were off the sand, over
which they had been racing side by
side, and beginning to breast the
mountain slope, nor was Godwin sorry
that the clatter of their horses' hoofs
upon the stones prevented further
speech between them. So far they had
outpaced the Assassins, who had a
longer and a rougher road to travel,
but the great cloud of dust was not 700
yards away, and In front of It, shaking
their spears, rode some of the best
mounted of their soldiers.
"These horses still have strength!
they are better than I thought them."*
cried Masouda. "They will not gain on
us across the mountains, but after
ward "
For the next league they spoke no
more, who must keep their horses from
falling as they tolled up the steep
path. At length they reached the
crest, and there, on the very top of it,
saw Wulf and Rosamund standing by
Flame and Smoke.
"They rest," Godwin said, then ho
shouted, "Mount! mount! The foe is
close."
So they climbed to their saddles
again, and, all four of them together,
began to descend the long slope that
stretched to the plain two leagues
away. Far off across this plain ran a
broad silver streak, beyond which at
that height they could see the walls of
a city.
"The Orontes!" cried Masouda.
"Cross that, and wo axe safe." But
Godwin looked first at his horse, then
at Masouda, and shook his head.
Well might he do so, for, stout-heart
ed as they were, the beasts were much
distressed that had galloped so far
without drawing rein. Down the steep
road they plunged panting; indeed, at
times It was hard to keep them on
their feet.
"They will reach the plainâno mors,"
said Godwin, and Masouda nodded.
The descent was almost done, and not
a mile behind them the white-robed
Assassins streamed endlessly. God
win plied his spurs and Masouda her
whip, though with little hope, for they
knew that the end was near. Down
the last declivity they rushed, till sud
denly, as they reached its foot,
Masouda's horse reeled, stopped, and
sank to the ground, while Godwin
pulled up beside it.
"Ride on!" he cried to Rosamund and
Wulf in front: but they would not.:;:onned at them, but they replied:
"Nay, we will die together."
Masouda looked at the horses Flame
L ad Smoke, which seemed but little
troubled*
"So be it," she said; "they have car

.Mount in front of the lady, Sir God
win: and. Sir Wulf. give me your

brood can do."
Ho they mounted. Forward started
Flame and Smoke with a long, swing
es gallop, while from the Assassins
aboVo, who thought that they held
them, went up a shout of rage and

"Their horses are also tired, and we
r..ay beat them yet," called the daunt
less Masouda. But Godwin and Wulf
looked sadly at the ten miles of plain
between them and the river bank.
On they went, and on. A quarter of

"Spur the horses, knights," cried
Masouda. and for the flrst time they
spurred them.
At the sting of the steel Flame and
.Smoke sprang forward as though they
rid just left their stable door and the
l:c'P between pursuers and pursued
widened. Two more miles were done,
and scarce seven furlongs from them
they saw the broad mouth of the
Â», while the towers of Emesa be
yond seemed so close that in this clear
air they could perceive the watchmen
outlined against the sky. Then they
descended a little valley and lost sight
of the bridge and town.
At the rise of the opposing slope the
strength of Flame and Smoke at last
began to fail beneath their double
burdens. They panted and trembled,
and, save in short rushes, no longer
answered to the spur. The Assassins
saw and came on with wild shouts.
Nearer and nearer they drew, and the
sound of their horses' hoofs beating on
the sand was like the sound of thun
der. Now once more they were nfty
yards away and now but thirty, and
again the spears began to flash, though
none struck them.
Masouda screamed to the horses In
Arabic, and gallantly did they strug
gle, plunging up the hill with slow,
convulsive bounds. Godwin and Wulf
locked at each other, then, at a signal,
checked, their speed, leaped to earth,
and, turning, drew their swords.
"On!" they cried, and lightened of
their weight' once more the reeling
horses plunged forward.
The Assassins were upon them. Wulf
struck a mighty blow and emptied the
saddle of the first, then was swept to
;arth. As he fell from behind he
heard a scream of Joy, and, struggling
la his knees, looked round. Lo! from
sver the crest of the rise rushed squad
ron upon squadron of turbaned cav
alry, who, as they came, set their
lances at rest and Bhouted:
"Salah-ed-din! Salah-ed-dinl"
The Assassins also saw, and turned
to flyâtoo late!
"A horse! A horse!" screamed God
win in Arabic; and presently, how he
never knewâfound himÃelf mounted
and charging with the Saracens.
To Wulf, too, a horse was brought,
but he could not struggle to Its sad
dle. Thrice he strove, then fell back
ward and lay upon the sand, waving
his sword and shouting where he lay,
while Masouda stood by him. a dagger
In her hand, and with her Rosamund
upon her knees.
Now the pursuers were the pursued,
and dreadful was the reckoning that
they must pay. Their horses were out
worn and could not fly at speed. Some
of the fedai were cut down upon them.
Some dismounted, and gathering
themselves in little groups, fought
bravely till they were slain, while a
few were taken prisoners. Of all that
great troop of men not a score won
back alive to Masyaf to make report
to their master of how the chase of his
lost bride had ended.
A while later and Wulf from his seat
upon the ground saw Godwin riding
back toward him, his red sword In his
hand. With him rode a sturdy, bright
eyed man gorgeously appareled, at the
sight of whom Rosamund sprang
to her feet, then, as he dismounted, ran
forward and with a little cry cast her
arms about him.
"O Hassan! Prince Hassan! Is It
Indeed you? Oh, God be praised!" she
gasped, then, had not Masouda caught
her, would have fallen.
The emir looked at her, her long hair
loose, her face stained, her veil torn,
but still clad in the silk and gleaming
gems with which she had been decked
as the bride-elect of Al-Jebal. Then
low to the earth he bent his knee,
while the grave Saracens watched, and
taking the hem of her garment, he
kissed it.
"Allah be praised indeed," he said.
"I, hlr unworthy servant, thank him.
frcm my heart, who never thought to
see ycu living more. Soldiers, salute.
Before you stands the lady Rose of

Then in stately salutation to this dis
heveled, outworn, but still queenly
woman, uprose hand and spear and

he lay:

ANNOUNCEMENT.
For the purpose of encouraging California and Western writers,
by offering a consideration for short stories equal to that paid by the
best magazines, and for the purpose of bringing young and unknown
writers to the front, the Sunday Call announces a weekly fiction con
test in which a cash prize of $50 will bo paid each week for the best
story submitted. There is no section of America more fertile in ma
terial for fiction or more prolific in pons gifted to give spirit to the
material at hand than is California and the West. Therefore the Sun
day Call offers $50 for the best story submitted each week by a West
ern writer. Stories of Western life and Western characters will, as a
rule, be given the preference, but all strong stories, and especially
etrong stories by new writers, will receive careful consideration.
Each story will be judged strictly upon its literary merit Type
written copy is the easiest to read and will receive the first consider
ation from the editor, but do not hesitate to send a story in hand
writing if you cannot afford to have it typewritten.
Fifty dollars in cash for a story of not less than 3500 words and
not more than 3500 words is approximately $17 per thousand words,
or 1.7 cents per word. The highest price paid by the leading magazines
for the work of any but the very best writers is rarely more than
two cents a word, more often one cent and a half, and generally one
cent. With the majority of magazines the writer, after his story is ac
cepted, is compelled to wait until the publication of his story before
he is paid, a period of seldom less than six months, and usually from
nine months to a year. The stories accepted in this contest will be
paid for immediately upon publication, and will be published on the
first Sunday following the judging of the manuscripts.
drugged winc~none other! Oh! Sir
Saracen, docs net the memory of that
chapman's trick shame you now?"
The Emir Hassan heard and grew
red, muttering in his beard:
"Like you. Sir Wulf, I am the slave
of Fate, and must obey. Be not bitter
against me till you know all."
"I am not bitter." answered Wulf,
"but I always pay for my drink, and
WÂ« will settle that score yet, as I have
sworn."
"Hush."' broke in Rosamund. "Al
though he stole me, he is also my de
liverer and friend through many a
peril, and. had It not been for him, by
now " and she shuddered.
"I do not know all the story, but,
Princess, it seems that you should
thank not me, but these goodly cousins
of yours and those splendid horses,"
and Hassan pointed to Smoke and
Flamo, which stood by quivering,
with hollow flanks and drooping heads.
"There is another whom I must
thank also, this noble woman, as you
will call her also when you hear the
story." said Rosamund, flinging her
arm about the neck of Masouda,
"My master will reward her," said
Hassan. "But oh! lady, what must
you think of me who seemed to desert
you so basely? Yet I reasoned well.
In the castle v of that son of Satan,
Slnan," and he spat upon the ground,
"I could not have helped you, for there
he would only have butchered me.
But by escaping I thought that I might
help, so I bribed the Frankish knave
with the Star of my House." and he
touched the great Jewel that he wore
In his turban, "and with what money
I had, to loose my bonds, and while he
pouched the gold I stabbed him with
his own knife and fled. But this morn

for the embassadors of Salah-ed-din
informed me of your plight. An hour
ago the watchmen on the towers re
ported that they saw two horses gallop
ing across the plain beneath a double
burden, pursued .by soldiers whom,
from their robes, they took to be As
sassins. So, as I have a.quarrel with
the Assassins, I crossed the bridge,
formed up five hundred men in a hol
low, an(d waited, never guessing that
it was you who fled. You know the
restâand the Assassins know it also,
for," he added grimly, "you have been
well avenged."
"Follow it up," said Wulf, "and the
vengeance shall be better, for I will
show you the secret way Into Masyaf
âor, If I cannot, Godwin will âand
there you may hurl Sinan from his
own towers."
Hassan shook his head and an
swered:
"I should like It well, for with this
magician my master also has an an-
cient quarrel. Hut he has other feuds
upon his hands," and he looked mean
ingly at Wulf and Godwin, "and my
orders were to reÃcue the Princess and
no more. Well, she has been rescued,
and some hundreds of heads have
paid the price of all that she has suf
fered. Also that secret way of yours
will be safe enough by now. So there
I let th# matter bide, glad enough
that it has ended thus. Only I warn
you allâand myself alsoâto walk
warily, since, if I know aught of him,
Sinan's fedais will henceforth dog the
steps of every one of us, striving to
bring us to our ends by murder. Now
here come litters; enter them, all of
you, and be borne to the city who
have- ridden far enough to-day. Fear
not for your horses; they shall be led
in gently and saved alive, If skill and
cure can save them. Igo to count the
slain and will join you presently in
the citadel."
So the bearers came and lifted up
Wulf and helped Godwin from his
horseâfor now that all was over he
could scarcely standâand with him
Rosamund and Masouda. Placing
them in the litters, they carried them,
escorted by cavalry, across the bridge
of the Orontes into the "city of Emesa,
where they lodged them in the cita
del. Here also, after giving them a
drink of barley gruel and rubbing
their backs and legs with ointment,
they led the horses Smoke and Flame,
slowly and with great trouble, for
these could scarcely stir, and laid
them down on thick beds of straw,
tempting them with food, which after
awhile they ate. The fourâRosamund,
Masouda, Godwin and Wulfâate also
of some coup with wine In it, and after
the hurts of Wulf had been tended by
a sl.llled leech, went to their beds,
whence they did not rise again for two
days.
CHAPTER XVI.
The Sultan Saladln.
In the morning Godwin awoke to see
the rays of sunrise streaming through
the latticed window. They fell upon
another bed near by where Wulf still
lay sleeping, a bandage on his head
that had been hurt In the last charge
against the Assassins, and other ban
dages about his arms and body, which
were much bruised in the fight on the
dreadful bridge.
Wondrous was it to Godwin to watch
him lying there sleeping Healthily, not
withstanding his hurts, and to tbink of
what they had gone through with so
little harm; to think, also, of how they
had rescued Rosamund out of the very
mouth of that earthly hell of which he
could see the peaks through the open
window placeâout of the very hands of
the fiend, Its ruler. Reckoning the tale
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALU
day by day, he reflected on their ad
ventures since they landed at Beirut,
and saw how heaven had guided their
every step. In the face of the warn
ings that were given them, to visit the
Al-Jebal in his stronghold had seemed
a madness? Yet there, where none
could have thought she would be, they
had found Rosamund. There they had
been avenged upon the false knight Sir
Hugh Lozelle, who had betrayed her,
first to Saladin. then to Slnan, and sent
him down to death and Judgment; and
thence they had rescued Rosamund.
Oh, how wise they had been to obey
the dying words of their uncle. Sir An
drew, who doubtless was given fore
sight at the end! God and his saints
had helped them, who could not have
helped themselves, and his minister
had been Masouda. But for Masouda,
Rosamund would by now be lost or
dead, and they, If their lives were still
left to them, would be wanderers In
the great land of Syria, seeking for
one who never could be found.
Why had Masouda done these things,
again and again, putting her own life
upon the hazard to save theirs and the
honor of another woman? As he ask
ed himself the question Godwin felt
the red blood rise to his face. Be
cause she hated Sinan, who had mur
dered her parents and degraded her,
she said; and doubtless that had to do
with the matter. But it was no longer
possible to hide the truth. She loved
him, and had loved him from the first
hour when they met. He had always
suspected itâin that wild trial of the
horses upon the mountain side, when
she sat with her arms about him and
her face pressed against his face, when
she kissed his feet after he had saved
her from the lion, and many another
time.
But as they followed Wulf and Rosa
mund up the mountain pass, while the
host of the Assassins thundered at
their heels, and in broken gasps she
had told him of her sad history, then
It was that he grew, sure. Then, too,
he had said that he held her not vile,
but noble, as Ind-.ed he did; and. think
ing their death upon them, she had
answered that she held him dear and
looked upon him as a woman looks
upon her only loveâa message In her
eyes that no man could flfcil to read.
Yet If this were so, why had Masouda
saved Rosamund, the lady to whom
she knew well that he was sworn?
Reared among those cruel folk who
could wade to their desire through
blood and think it honor, would she
not have left her rival to her doom,
seeing that oaths do not hold beyond
the grave?
An answer came Into the heart of
Godwin at the very thought of which
he turned pale and trembled. His
brother was also sworn to Rosamund
and she in her soul must be sworn to
Each Weds for the Best

one of them. Was It not to Wulf,
Wulf who was the handsomer and
more strong than he, to Wulf the con
queror of Lozelle? Had Rosamund
told her this? Nay, surely not.
Yet women can read each other's
hearts, piercing veils through which
no man may see and perchance Ma
souda had read the heart of Rosa
mund. She stood behind Rosamund in
the dreadful duel at â¢ the gate and
watched her face when Wulfs death
seemed sure; she might have heard
words that broke in agony from her
Hps in those moments of torment.
Oh. without doubt it was so. and
Masouda had protected Rosamund
because she knew that her love was
for Wulf and not for him. The thought
was very bitter, and in its pain God
win groaned aloud, while a fierce
jealousy of the brave and handsome
knight who slept at his side, dream
ing doubtless of the fame that he
had won and the reward by which it
would be crowned, gripped his vitals
like the icy hand of death. Then God
win remembered the oath that they
two had sworn far away in the
Priory at Stangate, and the love pass
ing the love of woman which he bore
toward this brother, and the duty
of a Christian warrior whereto he was
vowed, and hiding his, face In his pil
low he prayed for strength.
It would seem that It came to him
âat least, when he lifted his head
again the jealousy was gone, and only
the great grief remained. Fear re
mained alsoâfor what of Masouda?
How could he deal with her? He
was certain that this was no fancy
which would passiâuntil her life
passed with It. and, beautiful as she
was, and noble as Bhe was. he did
not wish her love. He could iind no
answer to these questions, save this
-that things mut go on as they were
decreed. For himself, he, Godwin,
would strive to do his duty, to keep
his hands clean, and *await the end,
whatever It might be.
Wulf woke up. stretched his arms,
exclaimed because that action hurt
him, grabbed at the brightness of the
light upon his eyes, and said that he
was very hungry. Then he arose, and
with the help of Godwin dressed him
self, but not in'his armor. Here, with
the yellow-coated soldiers of Saladin,
grave-faced and watchful, pacing be
fore their doorâfor night and day they
were trebly guarded lest Assassins
should creep inâthere was no need for
mail. In the fortress of Masyaf, in
deed, where they were also guarded, It
has been otherwise. Wulf heard the
step of the sentries on the cemented
pavement without, and shook his great
shoulders as though he shivered.
"That sound makes my backbone
coid," he said. "For a moment, as my
eyes opened, I thought that we were
back again in the guest chambers ol
Al-Jebal, where folk crept round us as
we slept and murderers marched tc
and fro outside the curtains, fingering
their knife points. Well, whatever there
is to come, thank the Saints, that is
done with. I tell you, brother, I have
had enough of mountains, and narrow
bridges, and Assassins. Henceforth, I
desire to live upon a flat with never a
hill in sight, amidst honest folk aa
stupid as their own sheep, who go t<3
church on Sundays and get drunk, not
with hashlch, but on brown ale,
brought to them by no white-robed
sorceress, ' but by a draggle-tailed
wench in a tavern, with her musty bed
straw still sticking in her hair. Give
me the saltings of Essex with the east
winds blowing over them, and the
primroses abloom upon the bank, and
the lanes fetlock deep In mud, and for
your share you may take all the scent
ed gardens of Al-Jebal, and the Jewels
of his ladles, with the fightings and
adventures of the golden East thrown
in."
"I never sought these things, and we
are a long way from Essex," answered
Godwin shortly.
"No," said Wulf, "but they seem to
seek you. What new of Masouda?
Have you seen her while I slept,
which has been long?"
"I have seen no one except the leech
who tended you, the slaves who
brought us food, and last evening the
Prince Hassan, who came to see how
we fated. He told me that, like
yourself, Rosamund and Masouda
slept."
"I am glad to hear it," answered
Wulf. "for certainly it was earned. By
St. Chad! what a woman is this
Masouda! A heart of fire and nerves
of steel! Beautiful, tooâmost beauti
ful; and the best horsewoman that
ever sat a steed. Had it not been for
her By heaven! when I think of it
I feel as though I loved her âdon't
you?"
"No," said Godwin, still more shortly.
"Ah. well, I daresay she can love
enough for two who does nothing by
halves, and, all things considered," he
added, with one of his great laughs,
"I am glad It is I of whom she thinks
so littleâyes, I who adore her as
though she were my patron saint.
Hark! the guards challenge," and.
forgetting where he was he snatched
at his sword.
Then the door opened and through
It appeared the Emir Hassan, who
saluted them In the name of Allah,
searching them with his quiet eyes.
"Few would Judge, to look at you,
sir knights," he said with a smile,
"that you have been the guests of the
Old Man of thÂ« Mountain, and left
his house so "hastily by the back door.
Three days more and you will be as
lusty as when we met beyond the
seas upon the wharf by a certain
creek. Oh, you are brave men, both
of you, though you be intldels, from
which error may the prophet guide
you; brave men, the flower of knight
hood. Aye, I. Hassan, who have
known many Franklsh knights, say it
from my heart," and, placing his hand
to his turban, he bowed before them
In admiration that was not feigned.
"We thank you. prince, for your
praise," said Godwin gravely, but
Wulf stepped forward, took his hand
and shook it.
"That was an 111 trick, prince, that
you played us yonder In England." he
said, "and one that brought as good a
warrior as ever drew a swordâour un
cle, Sir Andrew d'Arcyâto an end sad
as it was glorious. Still, you obeyed
your master, and because of all that
has happened since. I forgive you. and
call you friend, although should we
ever meet In battle I still hope to pay
for you that drugged wine."
Here Hassan bowed, and said softly:
"I admit that the debt is owing: also
that none sorrow more for the death of
the noble Lord d'Arcy than I. your
servant, who, by the will of God.
brought it upon him. When we meet.
Sir Wulf. in war -and that. I think.
Will be an ill hour for meâstrike, and
strike home; I shall not complain.
Meanwhile, we are friends, and in very
truth all that I have is yours. But now
I come to tell you that the Princess
Rose of the WorldâAllah bless her
footsteps!âls recovered from her
fatigues, and desires that you should
breakfast with her in an hour's time.
Albo the leech waits to tend your
bruises, and slaves to lead ydu to the
bath and clothe you. Nay, leave your
hauberk; here the faith of Salah-ed
din and of his servants Is your, best
armor."
"Still, T think that we will take
them," said Godwin, "for faith Is a
poor defense against the daggers of
the Assassins, who dwell not so far
away."
"True," answered Hassan; "I had
forgotten." So thus they departed.
An hour later they were led to the
hall, where presently came Rosamund,
and with her Masouda and Hassan.
She was dressed In the rich robes of an
Eastern lady, but the gems with which
phe had been adorned as the bride-elect
of Al-Jebal were gone; and when she
lifted her veil the brethren :.aw that
though her face was still somewhat
pallid, her strength had come back to
her, and the terror had left her eyes.
She greeted them with .sweet and gen
tle words, thanking" first Godwin and
then Wulf for all that they had done,
and turning to Masouda, who stood by,
stately and watchful, thanked her
also. Then they sat down and' ate
with light hearts and a good appetite.
Before their meal was finished the
guard at the door announced that mes
sengers had arrived from the Sultan.
They entered, gray-haired men, clad in
the robes of sectaries, whom Hassan
hastened to greet. When they were
seated and had spoken with him awhile
one of them drew forth a . itter, which
Hassan, touching his forehead with it
in token of respect, gave to Rosamund.
She broke its seat, and, seeing that it
was in Arabic, handed it to her cousin,
saying:
"Do you read it, Godwin, who are
more learned than I."
So he read It aloud; translating the
letter sentence by sentence. This was
Its purport: '
"Salah-ed-dln, Commander of the
Faithful, the Strong to aid. to his niece
beloved, Rose of the World, Princess of
BaalbecâOur servant, the Emir Has
san, has sent us tidings of your rescue
from the power of the accursed lord of
the mountain, Slnan, and that you are
now safe In our city of Emesa, guarded
by many thousands of our soldiers, and
with you a woman named Masouda and
your, kinsmen, the two Frankish
knights, by whose skill in arms and
courage you were saved. Now this is to
command you to come to our court at
Damascus as soon as you may be fit to
travel, knowing that here you will be
received with love and honor. Also I
Invite your kinsmen to accompany you,
since I knew their father, and would
welcome knights who have done such
great deeds, and the woman Masouda
with them. Or, If * they prefer it, all
three of them may return to their own
lands and people.
"Hasten, my niece, lady Rose of the
World, hasten, for my spirit seeks you
and my eyes desire to look upon you.
In the name of Allah, greeting."
"You have heard," said Rosamund, as
Godwin finished reading the scroll.
"Now, my cousins, what will you do?"
"What else but go with you, whom
we have come so far to seek?" an
swered Wulf, and Godwin nodded his
head In assent.
"And you, Masouda?"
"I, lady? Oh, I go also, since were I
to return yonder," and she nodded to
ward the mountains, "my greeting
would be one that I do not wish."
"Do you note their words, Prince
Hassan?" asked Rosamund.
"I expected no other," he answered,
with a bow. "Only, knights, you must
give me a promise, for even In the
midst of my army such Is needful from
men who can fly like birds out of the
fortress of Masyaf and from the knives
of the Assassinsâwho are mounted,
moreover, on the swiftest horses In
Syria that have been trained to carry
a double burden," and he looked at
them meaningly. "It Is that upon this

Journey you will not attempt to escape
with the Princess, whom you have fol
lowed from over sea to rescue her out
of the hand of Salah-ed-din."
Godwin drew from his tunic the
cross which Rosamund had left him
In the hall at Steeple, and saying: "I
swear upon this holy symbol that
during our journey to Damascus I will
attempt no escape with or without my
cousin Rosamund," he kissed It.
"And I swear the same upon my
sword," added Wulf, laying his hand
upon the silver hilt of the great blade
which had been his forefather's.
"A security that I like better," said
Hassan with a smile, "but in truth,
knights, your word* is enough for me."
Then he looked at Masouda and went
on. still smiling: "Nay. it is useless;
for women who have dwelt yonder
oaths have no meaning. Lady, we
must be content to watch you, since
my lord has bidden you to his city,
which, fair and brave as you are, to
be plain, I would not have done."
Then he turned to sneak to the
sectaries, and Godwin, who was
noting all, saw Masouda's dark eyes
follow him and in them a very strange
light.
"Good," they seemed to say; "as
you have written, so shall you read."
That same afternoon they started
for Damascus, a great army of horse
men. In Its midst, guarded by a
thousand spears, Rosamund was borne
In a litter. In front of her rode Has
san, with his yellow-robed bodyguard;
at her side, Masouda; and
for, notwithstanding his hurts, Wulf
would not be carriedâthe brethren,
mounted upon ambling palfreys. After
them, led by slaves, came the
chargers. Flame and Smoke, recov
ered now. but still walking stiffly and
then rank upon rank of turbaned
Saracens. Through the open curtains
of her litter Rosamund beckoned to
the brethren, pushed alongside
of hor.
"Look," she said, pointing with her
hand.
They looked, and there, bathed in
the glory of the sinking sun, saw the
impregnable city and fortress of
Masyaf, and below It the slopes down
which they had ridden for their lives.
Nearer to them flashed the river bor%
dered by the town of Emesa. Set at
intervals along Its walls were spears,
looking like filaments against the
flaming, sunset sky, and on each of
them a black dot, which was the head
of an Assassin, while from the turrets
above the golden banner of Saladin
fluttered in the evening wind.
That ntght they camped in the desert,
and next morning, surrounded by wan
dering tribes of Bedouins mounted on
their camels, marched on again, sleep
ing that night In the ancient fortress
or Baalbec, whereof -the garrison and
people, having been warned by run
ners of the rank and titles of Rosa
mund came out to do her homage as
their lady.
Hearing of It she left her litter and
mounting a splendid horse which they
had sent her as a present, rode to meet
them, the brethren, in full armor and
once more bestriding Flame and
Smoke, beside her and a guard of Sal
adin's own Mamelukes behind. Sol
emn, turbaned men, who had been
commanded so to do by messengers
from the Sultan, brought her the keys
of the gates on a cushion, minstrels
and soldiers marched before her, while
crowding on the walls and running
alongside came the citizens in their
thousands. On they went through the
open gates, past the towering columns
of ruined temples once a home of the
worship of heathen gods, through
courts and vaults to the citadel sur
rounded by Its gardens that In dead
ages had been the Acropolis of forgot
ten Roman Emperors.
Here in the portico Rosamund turned
her horse and received the salutations
of the multitude as though she also
were one of the world's rulers. In
deed, It seemed to the brethren watch
ing her as she sat upon the great white
hcrse apd surveyed the shouting, bend
ing crowd with flashing eyes, splendid
in her bearing and beautiful to Bee, a
Prince at her stirrup and an army at
her back, that none of those who had
trod that path before her could have
seemed greater or more glorious in
the hour of their pride than did this
English girl, who by the whim of Fate
had suddenly been set so high. Truly
by blood and nature she was fitted to
be a Queen. Yet as Rosamund sat thus
the pride passed from her face and her
eyes fell.
"Of what are you thinking?" asked
Godwin at her side.
"That I would we were back among
the summer fields at Steeple," she an
swered, "for those who are lifted high
may fall low. Prince Hassan, give the
captains and people my thanks and
bid them be gone. I would rest."
Thus for the first time and last did
Rosamund behold her ancient fief of
Baalbec, which her grandsire, the great
Ayoub, had ruled before her.
That night there was feasting In the
mighty, Immemorial halls, and singing
and minstrelsy and the dancing of fair
women and the giving of gifts. For
Baalbec, where birth and beauty were
ever welcome, did honor to its lady the
favored niece of the mighty Salah-ed
dln. Yet there were some who mur
mured that she would i bring no good
fortune to the Sultan * this his city,
who was not of all the blood of Ayoub,
but half a Frank and a cross worship
er, though even these praised her
beauty and her royal bearing;. The
brethren they praised also, although
these were unbelievers, and the tale of
how Wulf had fought the traitor
knight upon the Narrow Way and of
how they had led their kinswoman
from the haunted fortress of Masyaf
was Dassed from mouth to mouth.
At dawn the next day, on orders re
ceived from the Sultan, they left Baal
bec, escorted by the army and many of
the notables of the town. That after
noon they drew rein upon the heights
which overlook the city of Damascus,
Bride of the Earth, set amid its seven
streams and ringed about with gar
dens, one of the most beautiful and
perhaps the most ancient city in the
world. Then they rode down to the
bounteous plain, and as night fell, hav
ing passed the encircling gardens, were
escorted through the gates of Damas
cus, outside of which the army halted
and encamped.
Along the narrow streets, bordered by
yellow, fiat-roofed houses, they rode
slowly, looking now at the motley,
many-colored crowds, who watched
them with grave interest, and now at
the stately buildings, domed mosques
and towering minarets, which every
where stood out against the deep blue
of the evening sky. Thus at length
they came to an open space planted
like a garden, beyond which was seen a
huge and fantastic castle that Hassan
told Ahem was the palace of Salah-ed
din. In Its courtyard they were parted,
Rosamund being led away by officers
of the state, while the brethren were
taken to chambers that had been pre
pared, where, after they had bathed,
they were served with food.
Scarcely had they eaten It when Has
san appeared, and bade them follow
him. Passing down various passages
and across a court they came to some
guarded doors, where the soldiers de
manded that they Bhould give up their
swords and daggers.
"It is not needful," said Hassan, and
they let them go by. Next came more
passages and a curtain, beyond which
they found themselves In a small,
domed room, lit by hanging silver
lamps and paved in tesselated marbles,
strewn with rich rugs and furnished
with cushioned couches.
At a sign from Hassan they stood
still in the center of this room, and
looked about them wondering. The
place was empty and very silent; they
felt afraidâof what they knew not.
Presently curtains upon Its further
side opened and through them came
a man turbaned and wrapped In a
dark robe, who stood awhile In the
shadow, gazing at them beneath the
lamps.
[Continued Next Sunday.]FEVER
"The Fever at Bully Creek" is by
Charles Tenny Jackson, whose story.
"The Masque of Joy," appeared in tht
Christmas edition of The Sunday Call.
Mr. Jackson is a resident of San Fran-
Cisco and a young writer whose work
has attracted attention in the East.
THE white painted headboard,
which stuck out of the alkali
clods near the stage road two
miles above the stamp mill, was
inscribed:
JOHN LANCASTER FRATNE.
Born .
Departed This Lid,
(Per V. B.)
July B. 1899.
â¢ Bully Creek was complacently proud
cf this disposal of John Lancaster
Fraype. Contrary to all Ideas Eastern
of things Western âmining camps in
particular âthe leading citizens of
Bully Creek maintained no private
burying grounds In fact Bully Creek
had never possessed a "bad man" unless
Jack Frayne could lay a posthumous
claim to the distinction. Yet Frayne
had been only a faro player, temperate,
Imperturbable, serious-minded, and en
titled to such standing as any young
Knan might win by persistent efforts to
break De Toung St Ingalls' bank, in
which calling he was as successful as
mar other student of the layout.
But, although Bully Creek respected
Pack Frajrne'a professional attainments
goid Vked him for hla quiet geniality
Suod evident breeding, yet there had
fcesn tort two persons who showed gen-
Cc regret at the disclosures follow
tfce night when the King Hill and
JLas Animas stage rolled belated Into
oamp, and "Pl-Ute" Johnson came
gSMrffly into De Young A Ingalls' place
go remark:
""Vlrgie BJalr got the Wlsard this
frrp. Dropped him In the big flat east
â tf Toutaey*e ranch."
Those two persons were Mrs. Story,
at whoa* hotel Frayne had boarded,
t\nd Judge Blount, who, at the very
moment when the Pi-TJte appeared
With his announcement, was noting
contemplatively that Frayne was not
at his accustomed place before Mina
its Young's layout. But then the young
â nan was wont to disappear a few days
Moh month, "on business in Tucson,"
â ftcr which he resumed the feeding of
money Into Mlna's bank with per
functory Interest.
The Judge followed the crowd Into
the street. In the stage was a dead
roan, Itxnp, dusty and with a false white
beard hanging awry from his bloody
â¢ar. Virgil Blair, the driver, and
Artie, the shotgun express messenger,
were the center of an attentive group.
"Had eight thousand on from the
Blue Aster, and me and Artie was
peeled for anythin* along the King Hill
road where the stage was held up last
May. Wasn't lookin' for trouble when
We struck the big flatâain't a stick
or stone big enough to hide a coyote.
But right In the middle up Jumps the
old man himself. It was "the Wis all
rightâhe'd dug a hole and covered up,
and now he had us sewed. Sung out
for the box, and Just then somethin*
happened. Sounded like a hofce
throwin' himself off in the dark, and
the old man turned his head. Quick as
Ughtnin', but I nailed him. You know
that forty-five o' mine throws a hole
-*he never wiggled. Gentlemen, there's
the man who's held up Wells-Far go
three timesâwalk up and look at him!"
Doc Hare flashed a lantern above
the bandit's face. He whistled and
muttered softly:
"My God! Where's the Judge?"
The holdup man was Jack Frayne,
faro player at De Young & Ingalls',
g-entlemanly boarder at Mrs. Story's,
Intimate of Judge Blount, formerly of
the Territorial Court, Stage robbing
Is unpopular in the West. Three times
had this masquerader looted the ex
press box and escaped. Yet over his
body the Judge wept. Bully Creek
was shocked at the duplicity of
Frayne, stirred at his daring, gratified
at his downfall and proud of Virgil
Blair who had caught the wily Wizard
at his wiliest game.
The camp quickly forgot the day's
wonder, the killing of the King Hill
bandit and his identification as the
law abiding young gambler who had
apparently devoted himself solely to
the peaceful pursuits of De Young &
Ingalls' layout. The blacksmith at the
stamp mill put up the headboard with
its "Departed This Life (per V. B.)"
as a happy tribute to Virgil Blair's
public spirited quickness with a gun
and the beady-eyed lizards panted and
scurried about the clods on the hill
side. The usual drift of cattlemen and
miners contributed to the games; the
stage ran as before, thirty-five miles
to the railroad; but Judge Blount
sighed more often at a certain monot
onous materialism at Bully Creek af
ter the passing of Frayne.
Of all the community, Frayne had
appealed to the Kentuckian's fine sense
of the amenities of life; Frayne, too,
had been college bred, yet in their
fellowship not even the Judge's most
delicate conjecture could guess why
the younger man was in Arizona, a
serious student of De Young & In
galls' silver box, nor, later, what wild
blood had set him to stage robbing to
pay the score of his tutoring.
A month after the Wizard's taking
off, Mina de Young came to the
Judge's room at Mrs. Story's. He ex
tended a letter and said, shortly:
"We're in for it. From Frayne's
mother; she thinks he's sick. Being as
Jack's passed, I opened it. She's a
widow woman and. Judge, somebody's
got to square the deal. The boys, of
course, agreed to leave it to you."
Judge Blount read the letter, which
breathed a trust of motherhood in the
dead bandit of the King Hill road as
high and firm as the granite moun
tains above his grave. The Judge re
membered one Inviolable custom of
Frayne's life. Meeting his friend each
night at De Young's bar, he would
raise elbows in a solemn proposal:
"To a good woman," and then, when
they had drunk in silence, the gambler
would turn away and mutter, "My
mother."
It may have been an insight into
the sort of mother Jack Frayne pos
sessed that had Impelled the Judge to
weep when his body was brought to
Bully Creek and now to say, with a
hand on Mina's shoulder:
"Mr. de Young, suh, she must never
knowâthe woman who could write
this."
"Of course," answered the gambler.
"Doc and Virgie and the Pi-Ute all
subscribe to that. But she thinks her
boy has a fever; what are we going to
tell her?"
"He did," said the Judge, solemnly;
"he had it fatally, suh!"
Mina De Young smiled behind his
cigar.
"You sure called It; fever's bad In
Bully Creek, eh?"
"An epidemicâmost extraordinarily
severe, suh!" 2
The Judge wrote a letter that, at
midnight, was read to a group at De
Young & Ingalls' bar. It was in such
courtly language as the Judge could
speak; its text was brief, but of the
fellowship of sympathy. The widow's
son had died of fever, and Bully Creek
Joined in this expression of Its sorrow
and respect for his virtues.
'"Talk about breakin' it gently." said
Doc Hare, "it's a pomeâa reg'lar pome,
which, bein' inspired by only a tin
horn gambler and hold-up man like
Frayne, Just shows what the Judge
could do If he ever cut loose."
But a fortnight later Judge Blount
came into Mina's place in a greater
agitation than any one had ever seen
him exhibit.
"Gentlemen," he sighed, "this unfor
tunate mendacity, begun to shield that
good woman from a knowledge of her
son's end, is likely to precipitate an
unpleasant situation. Within three
weeks, she writes me, she is coming
from York State to learn the details
of her boy's illness, to âto âthank us
personally for âfor âwell, it is damned
embarrassing, suh!"
And then, while the group stared at
him, the Judge read the sweetest note
to them collectively that ever found its
way up King Hill Canyon. No man of
them had ever known the burden of
such sorrowful gratitude.
"I shall come to see my dear son's
resting-plaoe next month," Jack
Frayne's mother wrote. "I know his
grave' is green and cared for among
such men as you, but I must see it and
thank all of you for what you did to a
strangerâto my own boy Jack."
"Green?" muttered Pi-Ute, "and the
only other grave there is that China
man's who fell down the north shaft.
She'd think we was a same lot,
wouldn't she, to bury her son near a
Chinee! We'll have to fence the Chink
off. Ought to start a little grass, too,
long as she expects it."
"Grass?" frowned the Judge, "where
âin forty miles of this gulchâis there"
any grass?"
"Kip's got a case of bird seed down
at his store," broke in the stage driver.
"Been there ever since he bought out
that Boston man. What any one ever
freighted bird seed into Bully Creek
for, I duimo. But this here Boston
man "
"Get that bird seed," commanded
Mina de Young. "The Pl-Ute is hereby
appointed a committee of one to plant
that bird seed. The greasers'll pack
water up there for two bits a can. Cut
inâXH see the rake-off on the games
stands for that water and bird seed."
"You're a gentleman, suh," said the
Judge, gravely. "Bully Creek has long
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL,
needed such public spirit"
The Judge gave up his room at Mrs.
Story's to be made ready for the guest.
The heart of Bully Creek's one woman
welled up sympathetically to the plot;
a tear fell upon the hem of Mrs.
Story's apron when the "general com
mittee" acquainted her with the de
tails, which put them painfully ill at
ease. The committee felt surer of it
self at De Young & Ingalls' bar.
Day after day a water-laden mule
was beaten up the mountain road by a
stolid Mexican. The Pl-Ute superin
tended the watering of the grave within
the lnclosure, for a conspicuously new
barbed wire fence now was about the
half-acre of alkali clods and rock
which sheltered the horned toads and
lizards, and where the coyotes had
howled under the stars. The general
committee went out one night to in
spect the Pi-Ute's endeavors of a fort
night.
"Water at two bits a can" had re
duced the place to a melancholy sun
baked blot through which a dozen pale,
slender grass shoots struggled up.
About each, when the brassy sun
swung above the burned-out world or
granite, a rusty powder can was
placed to break the heat; every night
the Pl-Ute removed these that the tiny
green blades might suck in what dew
the dry land offered.
"Johnson's no great shakes on
grass," commented Doc Hare; "it ain't
no flowery mead, none, like the Judge
was recitin' of the other night, but you
gamble it's the only grass that ever
grew on this mountain."
"Maybe a bird seed lawn wouldn't be
much of a proposition, anyhow," said
Mr. de Young. "We'll have to let It
Â»out casual to her that it's been a hell
fire dry summer at Bully Creek."
"You have the idea, suh.V approved
the Judge. "Our only course Is to lie
like gentlemen."
The camp was well coached by the
night when Virgie Blair swung his
leaders at a smart trot to the hotel ve
randa. The Judge assisted a slender,
black-gowned woman to the steps.
Mrs. Story was sympathetically near.
Across the street, in front of De Young
. & Ingalls', all Bully Creek was gath
ered. It looked at Jack Frayne's
mother with silent and respectful curi
osity. A little woman, with the gentlest
face that the best of them had ever
dreamed about, smiled up in Judge
Blount's eyes as she took his hand.
The watchers across the narrow street
heard her whisper. The Judge bowed,
with his black soft hat crushed In his
hand.
"We are hono'ed," he answered,
"hono'ed. I assure you."
Mrs. Story suddenly put two moth
erly arms about the other woman and
took her in the door of the hotel. Vireil
Blair shifted his hat and reined in his
leaders as he turned the corner to the
stables. The stage driver was again
the center of a listening group at De
Young & Ingalls' bar after supper.
"Here I set, gentlemen, in the very
seat where I set when I killed her son.
and for thirty-five miles that little
woman asked me about Frayne and
thanked me for my kindness to him.
She saw a rip in my old
rip's been there for two yearsâand I
had to husk off and let her mend it.
Guess I felt I was playin' pretty low
down to have her set there and mend
my old wammus and ask me if I had
a fambly and was a Christian!"
Judge Blount strolled in from a lone
conversation with the camp's guest at
Mrs. Story's. Mr. Blair was still relat
ing his experiences.
"I am pained, suh," began the Judge,
severely, "to discover that you thought
It necessary to mislead this lady in
the outrageous manneh you did. You
told Mrs. Frayne, suh, that I employed
two doctors ad a trained nurse from
Tucson and paid the funeral ex
penses. It put me in an embarrassing
position when I had just explained
that Mr. de Young brought a physi
cian at his own expense from Benson,
and that Colonel Hare nursed Jack
Frayne with his own hands, suh!"
The Judge was stirring early the next
morning. The guests at Mrs. Story's
moved carefully and spoke low at
breakfast. When Jack Frayne's mother
did awaken and come out to look uoon
the store, the three saloons, the shan
ties and the chickens fighting in the
shade of the corral, the Judge was
waiting In the small carry-all. the fin
est "rig" which the Empire stables had.
A row of cayusea squealed 'by the
hitching bar front of the store.
When the Judge Nflrove Jack Frayne's
mother up the rocky King Hill road,
the committee on these same broncos
clattered in the dust behind the ve
hicle. They could see that the Judge
talked with the same stately courtesy
that he addressed to any hanger-on
about Mina de Young's stables; and
that she had a noble sweep of silvery
brown hair above a brow hardly
marked by time. The mountain air
heightened the delicate color of a cheek
that grief could not hollow.
The widow stood long in silence at
Jack Frayne's grave. The committee
sat its saddles outside the barbed-wire
fence. The Judge stood bareheaded in
the middle ground, between them and
the outlaw's resting-place.
The mother knelt to clear away a
rough lump from one of the tiny weak
lings that waved green among the sun
searched clods. Her handkerchief
cleaned the dust from the white-paint
ed headboard, with its "Departed This
Life" in new black letters.
" 'Per V. 8.,' Judge BlountT" she
said. "What does that mean?**
" 'Per V. 8.,' madam," began the
Judge, impressively, /'in the Territory
the law requires that a tombstone
shall make plain what the deoeaaed
died of. 'Per V. B.'âthat Is virulent
black fever, madam, I regret to say."
And the committee ranged along the
fence gazed at the Judge In such ad
miration as no man may lightly win
in all the Southwest.
The widow was dreaming in the hot
sunlight. Her eyes stole from the
flinty hillside to the water-caked
mound with its brave array of green
fighting the savagery of the land. Per
haps she saw what a spear of grass
cost in care and labor under this
burned-out sky; It may even have come
to her that the water, "at two bits a
can," which had made the spot a
waste of dried mud, had come two
miles up the canyon through the solici
tude of these same men who stood out
side the fence to honor her presence
among them; perhaps she suddenly un
derstood them as they could never
have understood themselves. She
plucked one of the living symbols of
Bull" Creek's dissembling chivalry,
kissed it and hid it in her bosom. Then
she faced them, the Judge and the row
of horsemen patient In the sun.
"I know how good you were to him,"
she said, simply, "I * understandâyou
must have loved my boy. It will be a
precious memory that he was worthy
of you and that there are such men
hereâin such a wild countryâas you.
It is all so differentâlt Isâlsâbeauti
ful! I thank you all for making me
see It as I do."
"Bully Creek is hono'ed," said the
Judge grandly. "Ita sorrow Is yours.
We shall remembeh you longer than
you will usâour memory Is the sweet
er, madam, that you have been among
us."
A silent cavalcade clattered down the
canyon road behind the carryall. The
Judge drove the camp's guest down to
the Blue Aster mine and on to Starlight
Ridge and the picture rocks. The Pi-Ute
reported to an interested coterie at De
Young & Ingalls' that Judge Blount
took her again to Jack Frayne's grave
when the full glory of the desert day
was /dying over the mountains, that
were gray and opalescent In the dis
tance.
It was midnight before the Judge
came into the place. He nodded to a
quiet trio before Mina de Young's lay
out. Presently the proprietor gave over
the deal to his gamekeeper and saun
tered to the Judge's chair.
"Where have you been this afternoon.
Judge?" inquired the gambler.
"I was favo'ed with Mrs. Frayne's
company during a drive, as she is to
leave us on to-morrow's stage. From
Oro Blanco Hill we saw the sun set."
"The sun set?" muttered Mina.
"Judge, how old are you?"
"If it Is of any particuleh interest, I
am 51 years of ago."
"A good sort of man, and 50 years
old," mused De Young, "and owning a
half-interest in the Cotton Bell mine.
You ought to go East. Ain't there any
place on God's earth you ever think of
more than another?"
The Judge ajppeared startled by the
Idea. Then he tapped his Julep glass
lightly upon the table.
"In York State," he answered with
dignity, "there is a little church with
roses about the doeh and music steal
ing down from the dark way up yon
deh. I am told it Is something like that
ânear a home spot where Jack Frayne
was bo'n. In June, next year, I reckon
on seeing it."
"You been invited?"
"I have had the honeh."(Copyright, 1804. by Cecilia A. Loi

looked at Anne Prescott, who was
standing on the very edge of the wharf
reading a letter. Anne's dress was of
cerulean blue linen and the setting sun
made her hair red-gold. Finally Ned
.s~oke. albeit the picture was rarely
pretty, and appealed to him.
"Ready, Anne," he called.
"All right'" said Anne, but she didh't
mpve, and Ned waited some more, pa
tiently, for he knew he was soon to
have his innings, and was in no hurry
to take the bat. But when he spoke the
second time he said firmly:
. "Come, Anne."
Anne tore the letter ,in two, threw it
into the water and came to the little
bark, where she settled herself Indian
fashion on her knees in the business
end of the canoe. She held it steadily
while he stepped in and bestowed his
long length of limb opposite; then she
let the boat drift while she rolled up
her cerulean blue sleeves. It was one
of Anne's peculiarities that she always
did the paddling herself. It was not
merely that the attitude and motion
were becoming to her, though she was
aware of her good points like most
well-balanced girls. It Avas simply that
she preferred having the men at a dis
advantage, at her mercy as it were.
They always looked awkward with
nothing to do; and it seemed hard for
them to keep up the conversation.
Ned Cramer was a little different. He
always made himself supremely com
fortable, and, while he didn't look at
her as much as most of the fellows did,
his glance always put her on her met
tle.
The quick strokes of her paddle sent
them rapidly downstream. When they
reached the first bend they passed the
letter, which was skimming along the
surface.
"We'll go down to the island and
see how long it will take for the letter
to get there," said Anne, and Ned as
sented, lazily. He lit a cigarette and
smoked a while in silence. When he
spoke his words were, as usual, to the
point.
"When are you going to marry me,
Anne ?"
Anne, elaborately surprised, held
her paddle In midair in a charming
pose for a moment. Then it dropped
into the water with a splash.
"I have no present intention of
marrying you at all," she said.
"Then it's a good time to form an
intention; I'll help you," he smiled
persuasively. "Make it October. Fall
weddings are so pretty, and that will
give you two months to burn all your
old love letters and make your good
resolutions."
The blood rose under the tan on her
cheeks, but her only answer was a
vigorous and renewed paddling. Ned
threw away the stub of his cigarette,
and felt In his hip pocket for his to

ran 'down the stairs eagerly
K9t at. the sound of the postman's
\Jbell.
"Four or five, with checks In,
please," she cried gayly, holding out
her hand.
Miss Fairlie, who had received the
mall, passed Kathleen's to her reluct
antly. Her experienced eyes told her
there were five rejected manuscripts.
Without speaking Kathleen returned
slowly to her own room
"Poor, little, disappointed girl!" sigh
ed the editor, who had passed through
just such bitter experiences years be
fore.
"I won't write any more," poor Kath
leen was sobbing. "It's evident I've
made a mistake In supposing I could
write. I'll apply for a place scrubbing
offices or washing dishes or something
She put on her heavy boots and laced
them up with vicious tugs at the
strings.
"It rains hardâpours down," glanc
ing out at the unattractive street, "and
I'm glad of itâa sunny day would be
actual mockery!"
She put on a short skirt and a mack
intosh and adjusted her oldest hat, cry
ing bitterly all the while.
"That story that I sent to the Im
perial is just exactly what the editor
said he wantedâthe stupid old thing!
I wish I was rich and owned a maga
zine. Lock at that rip in my glove! I
don't careâscrub women are not ex
pected to wear gloves."
She tramped heavily down the stairs.
"Don't go out, Kathleen," called
Miss Fairlie's gentle voice, "it is such
a driving storm, and I have just re
ceived a note from Mr. Coleridge that
he will call this morning."
"I don't want to see him," miserably,
poking blindly among the umbrellas
and taking the worst looking one In the
stand.
"Please stay, Kathleen," urged Miss
Fairlie, "he won't enjoy a call with me
alone. It must seem lonely when he
comes nowâonly two of usâand there
used to be so manyâ
bacco pouch. If he was nervous he did
not show it.
"Shall we say October, then?" he
queried, adding with a note of tender
ness in his voice: "You have made me
very happy, Anne. You will not re
gretâ"
"Well, of all the cool impudence I
ever heard!" gasped Anne. "I wouldn't
marry you if âif â" She stopped, ex
asperated.
"If you didn't love me," he finished
for her.
"I hate you," she boiled. "This is
six times you have made that insane
assertion this summer. Love you! I
act as if I loved you, do I?" She stop
ped paddling and looked at him. Her
eyes blazed, and he thought she hadn't
looked so pretty since the last time
she had refused him.
"No," she said, "yo.u act as if you
didn't, but I know you do." He look
er] serious. "Why, it stands to reason,
Anne, that you love me. or you
wculdn't get so mad when I tell you
about it."
"Ned Cramer," she blazed out, "if
you ever try to make love to me again
I'll âI'll make you sorry. Now, you
either talk about something else or
keep quiet."
She had evidently forgotten about
her intention of reaching the island,
fcr she put down her paddle and let
the canoe drift idly along shore. It
was growing dark, and a crescent
moon was faintly shining in the east.
Anne, looking attentively upstream. ~ y
saw a white speck in the water, and
taking her paddle, fished it out and
deposited it, dripping, on his knee.
"It's the letter." he announced,
touching, it. Anne started.
"Give it to me," she demanded,
holding out her hand.
Kathleen stopped crying long
enough to snap out pettishly, "Let
him stay away, then. What does he
come here for. a rich man like him?
I hate rich people!"
Miss Fairlie laughed. "You needn't
hate him for that reason. In this
note he says he wants us to know that
he has lost every dollar he possessed.
He asks if I can help him get the
position of assistant editor on 'Brins
ley's* that is to be vacant soon."
Kathleen stared at her with wide,
startled eyes.
"I'm very, very sorry for him,"
turning her tear-stained face away;
"It's hard to be poor, even for those
who are used to It."
"Won't you stay in, Kathleeen?"
"X can't. Miss Fairlie. I'm in just
that mood that I must go out and
walk. I'll come back for lunch,
though, if you're to be here."
"I shall stay at home to-day. Walk
off your 'blue devils' and then come
home and make yourself pretty. I'll
ask Mr. Coleridge to stay for lunch."
Kathleen plodded aimlessly along
in the rain, forgetting her own misery
in the contemplation of the changed
fortunes of Mr. Coleridge.
"How will he endure it?" she
thought pityingly. "I suppose he'll
have to give up that elegant home
and his horses and carriages and
everything. I dare say he'll miss the
orchids the most. And his summer
home and the autoâoh, dear, haw
hard it will be! I didn't think Miss
Fairlie seemed very sympathetic," re
sentfully, "and they have been such
friends, too."
The rain Doured down unceasingly
and the cold east wind pierced her
through and through.
"My feet are sopping wet," she mut
tered wretchedly, "and If the wind
blows much harder I'll have to put
the umbrella down; it is all I can do
to hold it. Perhaps he's tramping
around this morning looking for work
and is cold and wet âand hungryâ"
She sobbed in pity at the picture
presented by a too vivid imagination,
and stepped unseeingly off the side
walk into the glitter, through which
a flood of water rushed noisily. A
sudden gusf of wind tore pitilessly at
the old umbrella, ripping the cover
from the ribs and fairly upaetting the
sobbing girl, who clung desperately
to the handle as she went down Into
the rushing, muddy water.
"I wish It was deep enough to drown
me," she gasped, as she struggled to
rise.
"Why, Kathleen, child, why are you
out In this storm?"
In her misery she did not recognize
the strong, comforting voice and she
only cried helplessly as she was lifted
bodily into a luxurious carriage and
the door closed.
"Don't cry, Kathleen, we'll be home
in a few minutes and you must make
yourself dry and warm before you
take cold and are sick. How for
tunate I was passing and on my way
to The Octagon, too."
The Octagon was the home of the
bachelor girls, six of them once, now
only two, thanks to Cupid.
She was trembling with cold and
nervousness and wretchedly conscious
of her wet, bedraggled, miserable ap
pearance, but the pitiful picture of
her imagination was still too strong
to be dismissed.
"Did youâget a job?" she whis
pered intensely and then laughed
hysterically at the unfamiliar phrase
ology of her question.
Coleridge stared at her uncompre

hendingly for a second and then his
face lightened.
"Iâl have hopes of one," gravely.
""I'm gladâso glad. Oh, I wish I
could give it all back to you."
"The money, you mean?" â¢ .
"Yes, you'll miss It soâ"
"Money isn't all â there are other
things, Kathleen," earnestly watching
her expressive face. "What would you
think of a woman who refused a man
because he had become poor?"
"Did Miss Fairlie do that?" cried
Kathleen hotly. "I never dreamed she
would be so mercenary!"
"Would you do that, Kathloon?"
"No, I would not!" passionately. 'Td
love him all the more and try to make
It up to him In other ways."
"I'd be glad to be poor if I could
know that you loved me, Kathleen."
She gazed at him with frightened,
troubled eyes.
"I have loved you a lone time,
Kathleen," he urged, "but you are so
much younger I was afraid to ask
you." , â
"But you have Just proposed to Miss
Fairlie!" she burst forth vehemently,
"and she refused you because you are
now poorâ"
"Oh. no," quietly. "I only supposed
a case. I proposed to her ten years
ago and she refused because she cared
more for her career. We have been
good friends ever since.. It Is you,
Kathleen, that I want, if you care
for a poor man âan old fellow like
meâ"
He put out his hand entreatlngly and
touched her wet glove. She shrank
from him and huddled miserably back
into the corner.
"Don't touch me/ she cried sharply,
"and don't talk moreâl can't bear It
no w."
And then a miracle happenedâfor a
man comprehended a woman's feelings.
Coleridge reached into the broadcloth
pocket at the side of the carriage and
drew out a hand-mirror.
"*"Look, Kathleen, see how pretty the
rwn has mads yeur hair curl."
She caught the glass eagerly. "I
thought there was mud On my nose,"
laughing and crying together. "It's a
wonder there isn't, the way I fell
downâ"
He took the mirror from her gently.
"You haven't answered my question,
Kathleenâ" â¢
She gazed earnestly Into bis pleading
face. "Could you really bo glad to be
poor?"
"If you loved me, Kathleen. I could
be glad lor everything."
"Then please be glad," she murmured
softly, "for I have loved you always "
Be took her la his arms and held her
dose. "Kathleen, dear. I am half
â shamed bow to tall you, but that note
to Miss Fairlie was a base deceptionâ
to yon. I wanted to bo sure that you
loved me, theâpoor and 'out Of a Job.' "
"Do yon moan that you are not poor
âthat ydu are still rich?" nhe cried re
gretfully. "Oh, and I thought I could
help youâ"
"You will help me with your love,
dearest, and I am doubly rich now that
I have you."
She was silent for a moment, and
than laughed Joyously. "On second
thought I am glad you are richâX want
you to buy a magazine."
"AfteÂ» /vÂ« read it," he saio. calmly".
"Ned Cramer, that's my letter, and
you have no right to read it."
"On the contrary, it's mine, since,
firstly, you threw it away; and second
ly, picked It up again and gave it to
me, *To have and to hold.' "
Anne quaked, but she tried bravado.
"Well, it's too dark to read It any
how, besides it's all soaked and
bleared," she said.
"My excellent eyes are not the least
of my many good points," said Ned,
spreading it out carefully. Anne
looked about for moans of escape. She
saw Ned lean out and snatch some
thing out of the water.
"It's the other half." he beamed.
"Now. I'll read it to you." He patched
the halves together, held them to his
eyes a moment, laid them down again
on his knee and glanced over at Anne.
She looked relieved.
"I told you it was too dark." she
1 said, triumphantly.
"I have some matches," he an
swered, pulling out a little case.
"Anne," he went on, "you know you
levo me."
"I know that I hate you," she an
swered.
"Anne," he said, smiling at her,
"I'm going to give you just one min
ute to tell me you love me, and if you
don't say it, then I'm going to prove
it to you."
Anne's heart panted to say yes, but
her stubborn will would not_yield. She
said weakly, "Ned, Iâ"
"Time!" called out Ned, and then
he lit a match and leaned over the
letter. Anne bent forward, her lips
parted, her fingers twitching. The
canoe rocked dangerously.
" 'Of course I love Ned.' " read the
man slowly. "The letter." he inter
rupted himself, "seems to be fromâer
some one to Clara Carlton.Of
course I love Ned, but he Is too sure
of It, and I meanâ ' "
He never finished the sentence, for

in. the muddy river. Anne upset the
canoe and landed Ned. herself and the
letter in the muddy river.
When she regained her balance and
thought of Ned, she discovered him

FARRAR Uhe WAIF
By Richard B. SHelton
(Copyright, 1904, by Richard B. Shel
ton.)
FARRAR had never before num
bered philanthropy among; his
sins, but since Miss Curtis had
taken charge of the Fresh Air
Fund Home in the little village
where he spent his summers, Farrar
had evidenced a decided interest in the
movement.
Heretofore he had labeled childrenâ
of <ne fresh-alr-fund variety and other
wiseâas unmitigated little nuisances,
whose chief aim In life was to annoy
their elders and bring people's hearts
into their mouths by falling into the
river or crossing the street In front
of a speeding automobile.
He had even complained to the town
authoritiesâbefore Miss Curtis took
charge, of courseâof the noise created
by the fifty or more youngsters who
resided a tew doors below his place,
and be bad suggested that the home
be removed to the woods outside the
town.
But with the advent of Miss Curtis,
Farrar's attitude underwent a sudden
and thorough change. From the mo
ment he laid eyes on her young, earn
est face and looked into her clear gray
eyesâall this was at the postofflce while
he was apologizing for bumping un
ceremoniously against herâFarrar
thanked his stars that the town au
thorities had not listened to his sug
gestions concerning the removal of the
home.
â¢It was beesuse of Miss Curtis that
the youngsters of the home held fre
quent end boisterous picnics in Far
rar's pine grove; it was because of
her that they often rodeâa dozen at
a his automobile and picked
his gooseberries and currants unmo
lested. It was Jimmy Morrisseyâ
possessed of All the precocious wisdom
of East Side childhoodâwho summed
up the situation in the declaration:
"Hully gee! De gazabo's dead easy,
'cause he's daffy on herâsee?"
Farrar walked down the street tow
ards the home in the red/ glow of an
August evening, a huge basket of cur
rants In one hand and a bundle of
cast-off but still useful clothing
(begged personally from young mat
rons of his acquaintance) In the other.
Behind him strode his solemn-faced
gardener, similarly accoutered and
evidently of the opinion that the boss
waa out of his head.
On the veranda of the home, Farrar
dismissed the gardener, and entering
paying no attention at all to her. Her
first thought was that It was fortu
nate he had caught hold of the boat.
Then she gasped in amazement, for
he had let it go, and it was
downstream.
"Ned Cramer, are you craayf" she
screamed. "Catch it."
"I'll take you to the Island first,"
he answered, and waded through the
shallow water to the bald, sandy spot
they called an island. It happened
that when he set her down her feet
touched something hard, but which
moved nevertheless.
"Ned," she screamed, "It's a turtlef"
Ned had started away, and he called
over his shoulder:
"They won't bite If you don't scars
them, or the snakes either."
Snakes! She held her dripping skirts
tightly around her, and stood, a pa
thetic but nevertheless a funny figure,
fear written In every line of her body.
She was too frightened to move when
she saw the great turtle she had step
ped on come straight toward her, cran
ing its bald, snaky head from side to
side. The tears rolled unheeded down
her face and mingled with the water
that dripped from her stringy, wet
hair. She sobbed helplessly, and with
horrified eyes was still watching the
turtle, which had stopped In his tracks
and was leering at her, when she heard
Ned's voice. Never had anything
sounded so good to her ears.
"Do you love me, Anne?"
How one will suffer for pride's sake.
She turned her face toward him, un
mindful of tears:
"I hate you," she sobbed.
"All right," he called cheerfully, 'Til
just paddle around a little, and when
you're ready, you call and I'll come.
As I said before, the snakes won't be
apt to bite unless you should happen"
to star on them or something."
He turned the canoe and took a doz
en strokes, feeling like a beastly cad
every time the paddle touched the wa
ter. Then a voice, wild and desperate
with fear, shrieked:
"Ned, come back!"
"Coming," he called. "Wait, Anne."
But Anne, terrified beyond endurance
by the advancing turtle, ran into the
water, and he pulled her, a dripping,
sobbing, disheveled figure. Into the
shelter of the canoe and his arms.
"You'll never regret it, Anne," he
said softly.
"But you will," she sobbed. Tilâ
I'll lead you an awful life!"
the house found Miss Curtis in her
cool little office.
"I've foraged more or less success
fully for the clothes you wanted for
your charges," he said, depositing his
lead, "and I brought you all the cur
rants that are ripe. You can use
them, I suppose?"
"You're more than kind." she said
gratefully. "You have given me the
first ray of light in a long, wearing
day. Sometimes I think they're very
ungrateful little beasts and I'm al
most tempted to give up this work"
"Do," he said eagerly. ,
She smiled wearily.
"If it wasn't for the question ot
bread and butter Involvedâ"
"Try something else," Farrar inter*
rupted.
"I'm certainly open to suggestions,* 1
she said with a sigh.
"Well," said he, "I know a place
you're admirably adapted to. I know
a waif that has some sterling qualities
and many faults. I'd like to see him
under proper care. If the faults were
corrected and the sterling qualities de
veloped, I think he might make quite
a man. I wish you'd take him and
experiment with him."
"And starve In the meantime?" she
asked.
"Oh, no." he said. "The waif is not
like these here. He has plenty of
money in trust for him. and a part of
It could be set aside for hla educa
tion. What he needs is a personal In
terest taken In him. He's a friendless
sort of chap. That's why I call him a
waif."
"Tell me more about this," she urged.
"What could I do for him?"
"You could make a man of him I'm
convinced," he said.
"Where are his relatives?" she asked.
"In heavenâl hope," said he.
"Poor chap, and he's all alone?"
"Absolutely."
"And you think I could get a posi
tion as sort of governess to him?"
_ "No," he said flatly. "I don't."
â¢ She lifted her brows.
"I think you could make a man of
him asâhis wife," said he.
She looked at him in amasement.
The- she noticed that his eyes sought
hers eagerly, and that his hand, lying
on her desk, trembled.
"He's a lazy, rascal waif." said he
haltingly, "but with some one to care
for him, he might be different."
Miss Curtis rosew The gray eyes
seemed looking beyond him and into
the future. And evidently that future
was satisfactory, for she laid her hand
gently on his shoulder and smiled.
"Dear. lonesome waif." she said.
And because of all this the fresh-air
fund hbme Is yearly supplied with fruit
from the Farrar place, and the fresh
air fund children who come, a new lot
each year, stay as much with Farrar
and his wife as at the home.QSUAIJLiY it is age rather than
wisdom that establishes a man
as the oracle of a rural neigh
borhood. But sometimes it is
a sort of quaintneas, a readiness and
an aptness in the expression of opin
ion, and often it requires more judg
ment than is likely to be found in most
communities to detect the difference
between the facility of speech and that
Intellectual virtue which the ancients
regarded as sapience. One night at a
social gathering to celebrate the golden
wedding of a Justice of the Peace old
man Brizlntine had for more than half
an hour held forth on the beauties of
uncompromising truth, when Lim
Jucklin remarked:
"Yes: there are very few things more
beautiful than the truth âsometimes.
But I don't know of anything that has
given the vicious a better opportunity
to vent their spleen than the truth at
all hazards. The man that don't know
when to tell the truth or to side-step
a trifle from It hasn't enough judgment
to be trusted with a dangerous ar
ticle."
"Do you mean to say," said Brizln
tine, "that truth is a dangerous ar
ticle?"
"Yes, sir; sometimes as dangerous as
gunpowder In the hands of an idiot.
That is, when truth is restricted to its
narrowest sense, and that is the way
that some men insist upon using' it.
Mackâsomebody, I came across him
somewhere âwanted to know if there
was such a thing as adminlsterln' to
a mind deaeased. There Is, and it is
the witlfjpHdln' from that mind the
true state of Its own condition. A good
deal of the sickness of this world is
in the mind only. This don't make it
any the less real, for the mind is as
real as the body and a good deal more
so. We see that a man's mind is dis
eased. He asks our opinion, and if
we tell him the truth it confirms his
own belief and makes him worse, and
may be a few doses of our truth' will
finish him. No matter how big a liar
a feller may be we believe him when
he tells us we ain't lookln' well."
"I don't exactly follow you," replied
Brizlntine. "But wouldn't you rather
know the truth on all occasions?"
"Well, not perhaps until afterward.
I recollect that one time I went on
three notes for a man. When the first
one fell due the feller that held all
three came to me and said that the
man I had accommodated had signed
over property enough to meet the other
two, but that I would have to pay the
first one. It didn't amount to enough
to warrant me in sellln' my farm, so
I went to work with extra force and
made the money and paid It. Well,
about six months afterward here came
the feller again and said a mistake had
been made and that it was the third
note that was to be taken eire of and
that I'd have to pay the second one.
This shocked me a good deal, but he
declared by all that was good and bad
that the third one would give me no
trouble, so I strained again, doubled
the forces of my energy and soon met
the other note without sellln' my farm.
Then I knew I was all right, but sir,
in due time here came the holder
of the notes and said that he was sorry
to have made such a mistake, but that
the property set aside was worthless
and that I'd have to pay the third
note. This hit me between the eyes,
but I strained again and paid the
note."
"But I don't see where the virtue of
all that lyln' come In," said Brizlntine.
"Well, I do. If it had been made
known to me at first that I had to pay
the three notes I would have let my
farm go at a forced sale and would
have been worse than homeless, but as
it was, bellevin' that I could meet the
small amount, I went to work with a
vim and when I got through I found
that the surplus of my extra exertion
had put me beyond where I had ever
been before. The holder of the notes
was a wise man. He knew that the
feller I had signed for had left the

The above paragraph was Intended

everything running smoothly upstairs
we can proceed now to a sane, safe
and conservative consideration of the
case of our old friend Solomen P.

Jenks attached to his person deserves

and he knew, also, that the full knowl
edge of it, told to me right off, would

both him and me benefited by It.
There Is such a thing as bein' a pro
fessional truth teller Just as there is a
professional honesty. I recollect once
there was a tollgate over here An the
pike, and it was kept by an old man
do for him in short order. Now Solo
mon's specialty, even in his earliest
years, was collecting troubles. Where
other people laid hold of some of the
things to which we have referred in
our highly picturesque Introductory
paragraph, Solomon was gathering
around him things that he could worry
about. No matter where he went or
what he was doing there was always
something within easy reach to bother
him. He could walk through a crowd

In the bunch sticking to him.
A peculiarity of Solomon's penchant
for troubles was that he always had
larger and more obnoxious varieties
than any one else. Of course, that's
more or less the way with every man.
Some men swear by their dogs, some
by their horses, some by their automo
bilesâalthough more swear at the last
âand all men, without exception, qual
ification or modification, swear by their
watches. So, too, most men have a
kind of an Idea that whatever they are
collecting is a little bit ahead of the
same kind of thing In the hands of
any one else. When Solomon was young
and was Invited many a time and oft
to join his masculine parent en a
whaling expedition in the woodshed,
he was wont to aver that the whales
were largerâand oftenerâthan any to
be found from Baffins Bay to the Cape
of Good Hope. If the disturbance in
the woodshed during the continuance of
the expedition could be taken as a
criterion there could be no doubt that
Solomon's statement was true.
It was'the same way, only worse,
with everything that happened to Solo
mon as he grew older. No one but he
ever had trouble in lying out of all
complicity in the episodes in which the
school house stove and large consign
ments of black pepper played promi
nent parts. The other boys explained
everything so nicely that the teacher
was inclined to the belief that he had
dreamed the whole thing. That is, he

Solomon on the witness stand. Then
he jumped at the conclusion that that
unfortunate youngster was responsible
for the whole affair and reasoned with
him with a ruler accordingly. Again
Solomon loudly announced his belief
that he was a child of eorrow and ac
quainted with grief and that if there
was any one who could show more
medals than he could for long distance
misfortune he'd like to see him.
By and by Solomon attained to the
age when he considered it his duty
and privilege to fall In love. The ob
ject of his adoration was, of course,
the most beautiful thing in the world
âshe always Isâand what Solomon
wouldn't do for her couldn't be dis
covered with a microscope. But his
troubles still pursued him. They

had tagged her with a large, able

him between sobs that he was a
heartless brute. Now this was all ac
cording to Koyle and meant toothing
more than that the engagement was
proceeding in the customary manner,
but Solomon at once jumped at th<Â»
conclusion that it was a special hahd
bethg dealt out to him. When the
young lady discovered how Solomon
fÂ«U about it she made up her mind
that it was her Christian duty to mar
ry him. Then she could show him
what real trouble was.
After matrimony Solomon was al
most as pessimistic about his own des
tiny as he was before, although a few
doubts about his having been selected
as the special prey of misfortune began
to percolate through his cortex. lit

ticed that the great American cook
problem was almost as difficult and
generally imminent as the question of
keeping a stenographer who will be
able to spell, to live on a salary that
will leave something for the rest of the
office on pay day and at the same time
be possessed of a sufficient quantity of
good looks not to interfere with the
operation of the clock.
A man learns a good deal after he
has been ushered into matrimony. Some
men go so far as to say that if they
had known more before they wouldn't

named Bowles. He and his son workid
out in the field, while his wife took
care of the Kate. On one occasion she
went away to look after some young
chickens and left the gate open.
Along came a man on a horse. He
helloed and no one came out. Then,
lookln' across the field he saw the old
feller and his son at work, hoein' corn,
so he got down off his horse and
trudged across the ciods of the field
and came up to where Bowles was
swettin' under the br'ilin' sun.
" "There want anybody down at the
house to let me through the gate,' said
he.
" That so?' the old man Inquired,
lookin' at him sharp.
" 'Yes, so I have Drought you thj .*lve

" 'Oh, you havc>he said, takin' the
five cents and lookin' at it as if it was
a curiosity. 'Nobody there, eh? But
want the gate open?'
" 'Yes, the gate was open all right.'
" 'But you wouldn't ride through?'
" No. I didn't.'
" 'And you come trudgin' all the way
across this field in the hot sun to pay 5
cents ?' ,
" 'Yes, sir; I've done that because I'm
honest.'
"The old man turned to his boy and
called out: 'Jim, watch this feller. He'll
steal something before he gits off the
place.' "
Some of the boys laughed and Brizln
tine said: "Well, but the man proved
his honesty."
"But you wouldn't teach a son to
lie?" said Brizlntine.
"No, but I would teach him truth so
sly as to make him believe it was born
in him. One bit of inherent virtue is
better than a hundred virtues acquired.
The constitution we are born with will
stand more of a strain than the one
we build up. You can fatten a razor
back hog, mebby. Just the same as the
Berkshire, but give him a chance and
he will run off his fat, because he was
born that way. But keep on a fattenin'
razorbacks, and after several genera
tions they will lose their disposition to
run wild. Gettin' back to truth, it ought
to be an unconscious quality, like a
healthy organ in the body. A man don't
begin to doctor his stomach until he
feels that he's got one, and truth that
needs medicine ain't of the best sort.
You know what the Son of man said
when they asked him if he would pay
tribute to Caesar. He didn't say yes or
no, but he gave 'em a beautiful figure.
A blunt truth would not have been any
truer and not half so wise."
"But. Uncle Lim," said a young fel
low, "how about a 'possum dog that

"My son," replied Old Limuel, "I've

the last sentence means. For the life of
us. we can't remember.) As we have
intimated, Solomon began to find out
for the first time that while he had
troubles, he was a long way from hav
ing a monopoly of the available supply
of misfortune. This line of thought led
him to reconsider In his mind some of
the critical periods in his career, when
it seemed to him that fate had used
him about as low down as possible. He
remembered In sections, so to speak,
but It came to him gradually that while
he was licked about as much as the
average when he was a youngster,
there were a number of other boys
who were right up with him and a few
who were away in the lead. He also
recalled that while he and his fiancee
had had numerous quarrels, which al
ways ended without bloodshed, one of
his friends had been kicked head over
heels down the front steps by an Irate
parent called In to reconcile a slight
difference between the loving pair.
Such action Is calculated to cast a
gloom over the general principle of ar
bitration, t
The more he thought about it the
more he "was inclined to think that in
stead of being the special receiver of
the bulk of the sorrows and burdens of
life prepared by Providence for general
distribution he was in many respects
the child of fortune. He had his trou
bles, but so had his wife, and she had
him besides, although he may not have
thought of himself as a trouble Just at
that particular time. However, as far
as ha could see the rest of the people
in the world had enough troubles of
their own to keep them from thinking
that they had any special pull with
destiny.
Thereupon . Solomon P. Jenks mur- '
mured gently but firmly to himself:
"Go to! I will rejoice and be glad that
there is enough trouble to go round
without slighting any one or giving
any man more than his fair snare. Mis
ery loves company, and I have come to
the conclusion that a man who Is look
ing for that kind of company can al
ways find it without undue exertion."

out, first selling my gorgeous cap to
the ship's carpenter for SI.
That goal of so many restless spirits
âNew Yorkâwas too big, too vast and
overwhelming for me. The Immensity
of things dazzled me. and I got cold feet
on the ironmoldlng proposition because
I couldn't see any foundries. Some
years later, when I again blew In as a
newspaper reporter for Mr. Hearst, the
village wasn't big enough. Strange,
isn't it, how the universe shrinks and
shrivels when a young fellow gets out
to push It around with a lead pencil?
But while my S3 lasted I hung on to
the metropolis, taking In the sights,
mostly from the outside. Then I slid
on to Albany, deeming that town about
my size. They say the scenery along
the Hudson Is great. That may be true
enough, but when the tourist makes
the trip In the night in the paddle box
of a steamboat the view is limited
chiefly to foam and bubbles, and he is
moved at times by that moist feeling.
On the morning of Decoration day a
dead hero, without any rose garlands
on him, stepped off at Albany with his
little damp bundle and spent some quiet
hours along the river front drying out.
It was like Sunday. Next morning be
fore 8 o'clock I struck a fine Job, and
could have had several others. Many
patriotic ironmolders of Albany had
scattered bright flowers on the graves
of our nation's dead the previous day,
and couldn't get their eyes open in time
to go to work. One of the very best
seasons to seek jobs In Industrial cir
cles Is right after a holiday. The bosses
are out looking for you. One month
finished my course at Albany. There I
fell in with a crowd of gay young men
about town who doted on beer and va
riety shows, and the pace was too rapid
for a sport brought up at Mudville, 111.
One Saturday night after a wild be
baueh, and with 20 cents' worth of
beer in my skin, I broke into the shop
for my tools and started West on Mon
day morning on a scalped emigrant
ticket. Riding on that kind of trans
portation and in that kind of train Is
but little better than walking. The
traveler may choose his own air and
company while hoofing it down the
pike. The coaches were packed with
soapless foreigners, landed the night
who never break into the publishers'
lists. They, too, have their reward, let
us hope. At any rate they never have
to read the criticisms of their books.
Now that we think of it, we intended
to relate the story of the life and sur

with the thought that he had been

But Thomas had the courage of his
convictions and the first thing that
occurred to him after he learned that
he had been appointed general guide,

those who had no babies in arms prior
to leaving home corrected the omis

ever came to touring with a circus
and menagerie under one roof.
The day was the Fourth of July and
I celebrated my independence by sit
ting on a car platform, inhaling deep
draughts of osone, freedom and New
York Central clinkers. They put me
off at Buffalo, and I was glad my
scalped ticket didn't call for any more.
Another hundred miles and the ticket
would have been asphyxiated. My
capital consisted of 60 cents and faith
in the holiday theoryâthat a job
would turn up in the morning. In
the first shop that I entered the boss
said three of his patriots were still
absent, celebrating our glbrious natal
day, now more generally observed as
Lockjaw day. So I fell Into a sand
pile and got busy making scales that
cculd weigh anything from a letter to
a locomotive. This comparative range
is mentioned to show my wonderful
versatility in the scale building line.
Buffalo claimed me for a period of
six months, during which time I never
lost a day from the scale works. About
all I remember of the city proper Is
that In some places they sold two
glasses of beer for 6 cents. On Satur
day nights an immature mechanic, if
so disposed, could take home- a load
of peaches for 16 cents. I joined the
Ironmolders Union of North America
No. 84 and became a full-fledged ar
tisan. When the union gave its an
nual ball I was a lifelike member of
the reception committee âstood at the
hall door, wearing on my swelling
chest a huge purple rosette, with gold
fringe on it. I was a lalapaloosa, all
right. The man who worked beside
me in the shopâa Dutchman âwas
the committee on refreshments.
Soon after the doors opened he tapped
a keg of beer, without which the L. F.
toe cannot be tripped in some locali
ties. Then, taking a cluster of six
schooners by the handles the commit
tee proceeded to fill them at the spigot.
He loaded five. The sixth glass was
upside down, and when the stream
struck the bottom the Dutchman, with
keen presence of mind, reversed his
hand, spilling the five full glasses in or
der to load the sixth. We held an In
dignation meeting on the spot and fined
the refreshment committee for mal
feasance in office, and It was only by
the cleverest kind of politics he escaped
being expelled from the union. For a
space of three weeks his own shop
mates refused to speak to him.
A rare combination of business and
pleasure made a gay round of life at
Buffalo. Weekdays I toiled in the sand
and hot metal, and on Sundays in the
summer months I barked for a Niagara

Thomas Carlyle was flat on his back

in which there was an opening for a

It occurred to Thomas that there was

was a fresco artist who had a friend
boarding at my bsanery. That's how I
got in. No tickets were sold In advance,
as the cautious Buffalo sightseers
wanted a line on the weather before
doing anything rash with their fifty
cent pieces. If the day opened fair the
excursion train was assembled at the
station with a barker at each double
platform selling tickets out of hand.
All I got from this soft snap was a
weekly peep at one of nature's wonders
and my dinner, but since I was seeing
the world that helped some.
At length prosperity palled on me.
Things were coming too easy at the
scale foundry,, so I quit Buffalo with
my union card and moved on to Chi
cago. There, in a moment of reckless
extravagance, I purchased another $2
trunk, which indirectly led me Into a
raging holocaust, but the trunk and its
valuable contents escaped the flames.
At Chicago I worked for the Crane Ele
vator Company and boarded In North
Sangamon street with an eminent
steamfltter named Jim McCullom from
Muskegan, Mich. We were the star
boarders, Jim and I, and our home was
an ideal one of Its kind until, in an evil
moment, we purchased trunks. Jim
never did own one, ai.d mine was lost,
strayed or stolen In the wilds of Texas.
When the morbid landlady beheld
the new trunks moving in she thought
we intended to move out âto shake her
for another and more stylish beanery
âso what did she do but close up the
house that same evening before sup
per? This was, indeed, awkward, not
only for the steamfitter and the iron
molder, but likewise for two union
carpenters, who chided -Jim and me
for buying useless trunks and bring
ing on wholesale eviction. The land
lady was so mad and she retired from
business In such a hurry that the
ousted quartet and Its baggage took
temporary refuge In one of the sa
loons prevalent in Chicago at that
time. Now, they tell me. there isn't
a saloon left ln'the cltv. They are all
buffets.
Anyhow, a man In the future buffet

the corner in Lake street, and we per

nor did we have time to spring hero v s.
Just how the thing started and who
turned in the first alarm makes no
difference now. It was enough to learn
on that frozen midnight that the lurid

Capital." This was a brand new sub
ject which Thomas had found in an
exhausted condition up a back alley
late one night. He carried it to his
humble home and nursed it back to
life and consciousness again. Then
he told it as gently as possible that
he was going to put It Into a book, so
that all the world might know what
a gem of purest ray serene he had
stumbled on. After wrestling with the
gem for six months he had it cut and
polished till he thought it was abopt
ready to shine in the best society.
Then he toddled out with it and be
gan his weary rounds again. Then,
also, did history give another star per
formance of repeating herself in seven
different languages. History has re
peated herself so many times in the
past that she ought to know herself
by heart by this time. The first pub
lisher, who happened to be something
of a sport, inquired if it was a French
duel or a Plain American prize fight
that he was talking about. The next
one assured Thomas that he catered

deaf mute son was coming home when
he discovered the fire. He carried a
latch key, but realizing he could raise
no outcry inside the house, the saga
cious mute picked up a cobble and bat
tered in the panels of the front door.
The racket at last awoke us.
Jim noted the glare shining in our
curtainless boudoir windows, and said
it was time to escape with goods and
chattels. I said so too. In those days
I combined art with the gentle craft
of Iron molding, and consequently
possessed more chattels than Jim. He
had no side line, steam fitting alone

had over reached the cover stage. But
it didn'tâat least, not that cover.
Thomas tried Just one publisher with
this youngest child of his genius. This
man informed him in plain, unfa!':er
bed; let us lie about it, and say we like
it. As we have sown, let us weep.
"We have inherited much from our
colonial ancestors besides furniture
enough to supply a mighty nation, and
should be duly tankful. We know how
to shun delights which don't pay, but
have to be paid for. Here in our Nord
ern cities are millions suffering from
cold and proud of it. They know there
are parts of our great and glorious
country where de sun shines on de
links, where the mockingboid is not
silent in a furnace-heated room, but
pours his flood of melody In de bright
warm air of a twenty-dollar-a-day
Florida hotel. Dat is what lends keen
edge to de enjoyment *of de misery we
suffer where we are. We prove our
courage, our strent of mind, our joy
in sorrow, and de tight hold we have
on our pocketbooks by not going to
dose haunts of winter golf and outdoor
mocklngbolds.
"Many men have wondered why dis

not go out before dressing for dinner,
bring my slippers and house coat, put
anodder log on de fire, fetch me .a box
of perfectors, and place anodder bottle
where you can open it if I feel a chill
coming on.
"Now dat we have provided against
de woist, let us consider what, if any.
advantage we gain by denying de call
to sunny climes. Are dere any?"
Just den little Fannie chases Into
de room like a small whirlwind, fol
lowed by dat boy of mine, who was
home for his week-end, and dey says
Mr. Paul must go out on.de hack lawn
and see de snow man dey had made.
He slips on de coat and rubbers I
hands to him and we goes out wit de
kiddies. Dey sneaks behind a snow
tucked under my left arm the proces
sion glided rapidly downstairs.
The cottage stood back about fifty
feet from the street, and the blazing
building abutted on the pavement.
This gave us a fifteen-yard dash, over
which we broke the record, at the same
time dodging showers of. brick and fire
and jets of icy water, for the depart
ment' had reached the scene. It was
only by a miracle that I escaped un
hurt, Jim , also emerged unscathed.
Being a strong young man naturally
and somewhat excited, too. Jim held
his trunk bodily in one hand above his
head like a parasol until we reached
the middle of the street. There we
rested, while Mr. J. McCullons lowered
away his trunk and took a chew of
plug cut smoking he found in his over
alls.
Just at that instant the fat land
lady oozed from the front door. Her
valiant husband had made his exit a
fÂ«*w seconds earlier, carrying two glass
cones of hair flowers which Mrs. Spud
hash had created in her remote and
misty youth. At noon next tiay that
splendid husband turned up heroically,
drunk, but with the gems intact. But
â what can you expect of a healthy man
who lets his wife keep boarders?
When Mrs. Spudhash hopped out of
the bed she pulled on a loose wrapper,
belted it at the waist and darted into
a closet. Between the bed ticks lay a
purse containing $80, but the lady
never thought of mere money. From
the closet she rescued six bandboxes,
each containing a bonnet that she had
made. Mrs. Spudhash's hobby was
bonnets, mostly of rejuvenated velvet
that still looked weary and green
plumes of no particular epoch. She
starred them on all occasions where
a bonnet could be worn, and now was
ing accents, which sounded like shingle
nails dropping down an elevator shaft,
that people didn't want to know the
truth about G. Washington, or any
one else. What they wanted was to
be told something they already knew
about, a subject that didn't amount to
anything, by a man who didn't know
anything about it.
The unfortunate feature of the state
in which Thomas found himself after
ha was disillusionized as to what people
expected of the father of their country
was that he needed money and he
needed it badly. This Is not a new con
dition for a man to find himself In,
but that fact doesn't make it any
easier for a man who lands there for
the first time in his career. It was up
to Thomas Carlyle to get busy or ap
ply for the next vacancy in the county
institution for the support of the aged
and Indignant poor. Having laid out
his plans for his life work on the as
sumption that he was going to have
his hands full supplying the imminent

good and hard before we oould get
into action, and we was having a Port
Artur of a time when Miss Fannie.
Whiskers and Wily Widdy drives up
In de sleigh, and we gives It to them,
for fair.
"Take sides!" yells Whiskers, hop
ping out of de sleigh like a two-year
old; and we all gets into de game and
makes so much of a holler dat Duch
ess comes out to see was one of de
kiddies hoited. She got a snowball in
her peepers, and den it was rough
house all over de lot, till de women
folks was blowed, and near dead wit
laughter. Den all hands piled on de
coaster, and we started down de grade
at a mile a minute, wit de extra weight
to make it go. Kiddie* was steering,
and. misjudging de pace we was going,
would have landed us in de ice water of
de Sound if I hadn't twisted de back
bob, and give us de liveliest spill you
ever see. Dere was more tings going
trough de air dan Is seen when folks
is standing on deir feet, and for five
minutes we was digging women out of
drifts. Snow tings was doing, for
sure, until butler comes out and asks
Miss Fannie would he take tea off, or
would any one come and have some.
Dey eats enough bread and Jam at
tea to make a dinner, and was so keen
about de fun of winter sports dat after
dinner dey was all out for a moon
light skate, and at midnight dey eats
enough supper for anodder dinner.
"De beauty of our glorious nordern
winters," I hears Mr. Paul telling
Whiskers, "is dat dey gives you such
a toist and appetite you can eat
enough to carry you trough de sum
mer, when nobody can't eat nohow."
"Sure ting." says Whiskers. "I has
the time for a grand wholesale display
of millinery.
Amid a withering deluge of cinders,
flame and smoke my intrepid landlady
danced out of her blazing portal, bal
ancing the stock of band boxes, piled
six high, with the skill of a Japanese
juggler. Moving slowly so as not to
spill any bonnets, she had covered hair
the distance to the gate when a fiery
thunderbolt from heaven in the shape
of a redhot nail, four inches long, flut
tered into the lady's bosom. This may
have been a warm rebuke called down
by Mrs. Spudhash's Inopportune dis
play of vanity, and again it may not.
At any rate, the nail saved her life.
Dropping her bonnets, the bulky lady
emitted a shriek high above the tu
mult of the holocaust. She gained the
open street in two flat jumps, just as
an avalanche of brick and blazing tim
bers crashed down on the cottage and
Into the yard, burying the velvet bon
nets beneath twenty feet of debris. The
nail was saved, however, Mrs. Spud
hash carried this souvenir of our holo
caust three squares before the police
could overhaul her, and then the nail
was quite cold.
With the hair bouquets and the nail,
all they had saved from the wreck, the
thoughtful Spudhashes again set up
housekeeping, but Jim and I did not
return to this new abode. While not
Insistent In the matter of luxuries we
considered this furniture Inadequate
and not in harmony with our trunks,
which had escaped without a scratch.
So the steamfitter and myself went
elsewhere to put In our meals and take
out our sleep.

an easy matter for him to turn to
something entirely different. As he
was cogitating slowly and sadly late
one night a great thought struck him
violently in the neighborhood of the
cerebellum. The thought will be dis
closed in a few minutes if the audience
will please be patient.
The next week saw Thomas begin
ning his calls on the publishers again,
much to the surprise of the latter gen
try. That their surprise turned to ap
proval may be learned by glancing at
their lists for the following year. One
contains "Thomas Cats I Have Known
and What Happened to them," by
Thomas Carlyle Plunkett-Carlyle. An
other has a valuable work on "Frenzied
Financiers, or How I Held up the Mil
lionaires," by T. C. Plunkett. A third,
and at present writing the last, offers
an exceptionally attractive title as
follows: "The Secret History of Wash
ington's Second Administration, as
Edited from the Diary of His Boot
black," by T. Carlyle Plunkett.
Thomas is now in Europe gathering;
strength and raw material for another
incursion into the realms of literature
and lucre. Meanwhile those of us who
stay at home and struggle with our
meat and coal bills can solace our
selves with the thought that many a
book travels on Its title, and that you
arriveâsomewhere- i more quickly by
traveling with the current than against
it.

â¢ â¢ Wind and frost and driven rain, in a
cqpfljet of fifty years, had worn his
.heart'to the likeness of some gray old
crag Of the Newfoundland coast. Love
of .the maid was the living green of his
heart; a rank, misshapen growth, true
.enough, which we must liken to a
Lgraceless weed rather than to a flower,
â as it may appear; for we live in a land
where the perfume and splendor of
â¢flowers are commonplace, nor should we
etftre at a lily or ask the name of a

; When the maid was 19 years old and
could lift a barrel of flour, this Klihu
â¢Gale was one of two lovers she had.
Two to love the maid? Only two of
a people of strength to love the maid
who could lift a barrel of flour! Rather,
let it .be said: Two dared take up with
her*
, The one was rich in punts and nets,
the other In brawn and laughter: which
latter are more to be desired by maids
than- codtraps and schooners when
Stomachs are full. In truth, it was as
th'dtigh she had the youth of Ragged
Harbor tied to her skirts; they hung
about her, being careful, for suÂ«-e, to
â¢keep their distance. which was the
length of her arm, to an inch.
.She was a buxom maid, a plump,
hearty, laughing maid, with snapping
black eyes and a wealth of red bloodâ
a maid sound In lung and limb, with
mighty hands and arms, and a will for
work as great as her biceps muscles.
Such, then, was she; and when she put
dn : her pink merino gown she thrilled
4he hearts of men.
"Qfr, L<ard," Elihu Gale was wont to
groan Inwardly, "she do be a clever
maid, but she've a barb'rous appe
tite!**
One night in June, when the twitter
â¢of-mating birds had been in the air the
elao long", Elihu hid In the shadow of
.Ve'edfc. Rock, on the Old Crow road,
where all the love Is made; for young
Jim Rldeout, who was sinful mad for
the" maid, by all the gossip of the har
bor, had taken her walking in the dusk.
There had been no sign of flsh off the
harbor, nor above nor below, from
Round Harbor to the Cape, even so
late in the season as this, so Elihu had
time for jealous spying, as Rldeout had
for courting.
"I'll see un goa by," thought Ellhu
Gale. "I'll speer."
Now, lovers have ever been loath to
leave the dusk of June nights. You
may-answer why for yourself. How
ever that be, if you have saved your
heart from the spoiling touch of the
yeara yÂ«u will know, at least, that the
dus-k of spring is redolent of blossoms
and pulsing with love sighs.
It was not curious, then, that when
young Jim Rldeout, returning, came
.with the maid to Needle Rock, he
should wish the Bishop's Thimble miles
away, for the Thimble is that great
rock where the turn to the'vlllage street
is made and Aunt Phoebe's windows
â¢command the path beyond. Nor, come
to think of it, was tt curious that he
â¢Vhoufd drop his sinker ms soon as he
spied the loose end of a spool of
thread hanging from the maid's skirt
pocket; for no sooner had he stopped to
recover his sinker than he caught the
loose end of the thread, and no sooner
had he tied the thr to a handy
twig than he found his sinker.
This was not curious at all; but, in
the opinion of Ellhu Gale, who saw it
all, it was a deed that deserved, and
would eventuate in, damnation to a
fiery lake; which was the best he could
make of the situation. For, as Jim
Strolled aiong with the maid, they left
a trail of white thread which, as the
spool t.rned, added twice its length t<<
the dusky road. Such was their rap
tureâsuch the spell of the balmy soli
tude and the haze over the harbor
waterâthat the talk of squid and jig
ging, assuming, here, some strange re
lation to kissing, was boisterous to the
very paint of tenderness.
"Sure," exclaimed Jim, when the
spool had come to trie qnd of its 200
yards, "what be this trailin' astern?"
"Plague it!" the maid ejaculated.
" 'Tis me thread. Us'll have t' wind
up. up. Sure, I'll be late f hoame.
Plague It!"
"Plague it I" said young Jim.
"Plague it! 'Tis too badâ'tis now.
'Tis caught to a shrub, somewhere
sure. Plague it:"
So they went back through deeper
dusk, and with slower steps; and the
maid wound the thread and the loan
talked of squid and kisses. When they
came to the handsy twig the maid
wound up to the very knot, for she
was a thrifty maid, and would not
waste so much as an inch of thread,
and in the knot she found some\deep
interest for a time.
" 'Tis a clove hitch!" she exclaimed,
looking up.
"Iss, sure!" said Jim Rldeout
blankly.
The maid gave him a swift glanoe of
suspicion.
" 'Tis queer that," he went on.
"Hum! 'Tis the queerest thing I ever
knowed."
The maid edged toward him with a
twinkle in her eyeâa significant glint
there, which Jim did not perceive at all,
for he was stupidly staring at the knot.
"How do he come here now?" asked
the maid, absently. "Who tied un, I
wonder?" The twinkle in her eye had
spread to her mouth, where a vicious
little smile lurked.
"Hum!" said Jim, curiously examin
ing the knot. " 'Tis a clove-hitch," he
added, as though convinced against his
reason. "They be nar a doubt about
it." -
The maid edged closer and extended
her right arm behind her. Her under
lip was between her teeth.
"Sure, now," said Jim, scratching his
head, "how do he come here? 'Tis past
me."
She was bent on something, that
maid! She had her eye fixed on Jim's
cheek; and her arm was at Its full
length, which was not little. She made
her foothold firm In the moss, her feet
spread apart.
" 'Tis the fairies!" said Jim, looking
round. "Sure, Aunt Phoebe told me
they be nae end o' fairies f the Old
Crow Road. 'Tis queer, that!"
The arm of the maidâthe long,
brawny right arm, which, with Its
mate, could lift a barrel of flourâswung
swiftly In a half circle with an up
ward curve, and Jim, caught full on
the cheek with the open palm, was
knocked off his feet.
" 'Tis a fairy!" roared the maid.
" 'Tis the fairy that tied the clove
hitch."
She gathered her skirts about her
knees and went flying down the road,
waking the hills with her laughter; and
so fast aid she run that one of her ro
bust, red-stockinged legs could not be
distinguished from the other.
"Sure, she loves me:" rasped Jim
Hideout.
That blow! Had she been angry? No.
The last peal of laughter had not yet
ceased to be the shuttlecock of the
crags above. It was the sign of love.
Elihu Gale, in the shadow of Needle
Rock, felt that he was bereft. An old
heart new seared! Jim Rldeout knew
that he was beloved. For a time he lay
on the moss where he had fallen; fear
ing to stirâeven to move his eyes from
the depths of the sky where the stars
winked at himâlest his rapture should
depart. VTiat blow! The swift
strength and cunning >of it! The play
fulness of it! Adorable 'Mella Mary!
What bliss to be beloved by such as
thou art, O thou merry-hearted one!
He dreamed a thousand ecstatio
dreams in a flash. For sure, they had
to do with Hps and eyes.
Then he picked himself up and went
singing through the night. His heart
was a-flower with fine Impulses. In the
fall he would build a house. That a
fine impulse! Who, Indeed, would build
It for him? Could he wed without first
building a house? Ah, but he would
build a house with a porch. A porch!
Can you hang a salmon net to dry on
a porch? Nevertheless, he would have
a porch. Love had Inspired him with
the desire. So It was determined; he
would build a house with a porch un
der Quid Nunc, where there was a view
of the evening sky through the tickle
rocks.
"O Lard," cried Elihu Gale, emerg
ing from the shadow, making the cry
of the prophet a cry to voice his own
agony, "O Lard, feed me with apples,
stay me with flagons, for I am sick
of love!" He had neither seen an ap
ple nor heard of the uses of a flagon,
hut there was pain in the cry and be
seeching; a cry to voles his own ag
ony, "O Lard, feed me with apples,
stay me with flagons, for I am sick of
love!"
God pity you, old Elihu Gale!
It must now be told how that there
came a time when the sea and the
cold conspired to set hunger upon the
throne of that coast; a time when
hunger said, "Thus and so shalt thou
do," and thus and so all the people of
Ragged Harbor did. Ragged Harbor
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALU.
passed into the shadows of famine;
wherein mightily abound all those
terrors and afflictions which it la the
concern of life to escape.
*' 'Tis a hard lookout for Ragged
'Arbor," said Eleazar Manuel to Elihu
Gale one midsummer day.
There Eleazar's forethought came
to an end. Not so with EJlhu. From
that day he gathered food, seeking
everywhere, and he cruelly deprived
himself that he might accumulate a
store against a certain time. But all
he said to Eleazar was:
" 'Tis that, by."
Through the summer Ragged Har
bor subsisted on the tomcod and
dories of the harbor water, the trout
of the little lake beyond the man-o'
war,, the produce of seven patches of
hand-made ground and the stray sal
mon which were meshed in the nets
off the Mull, all being sufficient. In
the fall the wilderness provided three
caribou which had strayed from the
path to the south, a plenty of Juniper
berries, thirteen partridges and a loon.
When the winter threatened, the trad
ers came from the lower outports with
flour, pork, molasses and tea, long faces
and a generous fund of advids concern
ing the virtue of frugality;'but, being
wary of bad debts at such times, they
could be persuaded to advance on the
next season's catch, but food sufficient
to keep the fire of life burning until
the spring break-up, which, they pre
dicted, would be an early one.
Then tbe cold descended from the
north; it sealed the harbor and ponds,
froze the wilderness, filled the passes
with snow and spread the sea with Ice.
The people were cut off and locked
tight in their place, whereupon they
made great fires and proceeded to hu
mor their voracity with what the trad
ers had left; and when it came to
March they had eaten, their pigs and
goats and were searching In the stages
for forgotten stores of dried caplln.
When It had come near to the pass
of unclean food or starvation, which
was in the beginning of a late spring,
Elihu Gale waited for 'Mella Mary on
the Lookout path, half way up the
hill; and when she came down he stop
ped her for a word, for if he were to
speak at all he must speak now, be
fore the promised west wind blew.
"Fine even, 'Mella Mary," said he.
Even so simple a phrase was hard to
utter calmly, such was the agitation
which possessed him, for he knew that
the impending moments held the fate
of his desire.
" 'Tis that, Elihutoale."
'Mella Mary made as though to pass
on; but she wag exceedingly hungry
and weary of the pain -and she craved
a word of comfort.
"Do they be sign of a west wind,
think you, Elihu?" she asked, hope
fully.
"They be noa sign," Ellhu answered,
with such conviction as made 'Mella
Mary stare. " 'T's t' blow from the
nor'east for a week."
Ragged Harbor was waiting for the
west wind, which should break the rot
ten Inshore ice and clear the shal
lows, where the fish lay.
"An' they were potatoes a-plenty, we
wouldn't care," said Elihu. He fixed
the maid with his red rimmed eyes.
"Sure, noa," she sighed.
"An* they were smoked salmon an'
flour left t' Ragged 'Arbor," he went
on, giving each word impressive force,
"we wouldn't be hungry.
She was a robust maid; a large,
hearty maid; and her body had Buffer
ed deprivation for many days. It now
craved clean food as it had never be
fore known desire. She was In an
agony of hunger.
"Sure, noa, Elihu," she murmured.
"An* they were a quintal o' fish t'
the stage t' your hoame, it might blow
ncr'east for a month an' you wouldn't
care. Sure, girl," he added, smacking
his lips, "It would be fine with duff,
this dayâwith duff, girl, an' a bit o*
pork."
With the words, a mirage took form
before the girl: The table was spread:
there were butter and white bread and
scat's milk set out; a boiled cod, a
great white cod, with duff and pork,
and a mesa of delicate fishes' tongues
and facesâand a heap of yellow pota
toes were there; and the steam from
the teapot fragrantly drifted about
her. She shut her eyes tight, and grit
ted her teeth, and clenched her hands
âall to dissipate this cruel vision; and
it was hard to still the clamor now
roused within.
Elihu drew close to whisper. His
eyes were flaring under their ragged,
grizled brows.
"They be flsh t' my house," hs said
in her ear. "They be flsh an' smoked
salmon, an* flour an' potatoes. They
be flsh," he went on, accenting* each
item of the list, "half a quintal o'
flsh, two smoked salmon, quarter bar
r'l o' flour, an' three bushel o' pota
toes. They be all t* my hoame," he
said, with his face close to hers. "Flsh
an' salmon an' flour an' potatoes an'
tea."
She started from him. " Tis a
shameâ'â¢
" 'Tis noa shame!" hs erled. "They
be mine. I cotched un, an' I growed
un. I saved un. I went hungry f keep
un t' this day. They be noa one has a
right to un. They be mine. 'Tis not
shame."
Suddenly she became quiet, and her
silence was tragically significant Then
she spoke In a low, clear voice.
"Smoked salmon?" she said, while her
eyes glistened. " 'Tie t' my taste."
"Ise," he said. "They be two left"
"An* tea," she continued, under her
breath.
"Iss, an' tea."
The maid gave him a sidelong glance.
Were It untouched by greed It had been
coy. She looked away. She smacked
her Hps and spasmodically worked her
jaws. Then she looked him full In the
face with a smile, which was half-cun
ning, half-coquettish.
" 'Tis enough for two," she said, sig
nificantly.
that fhs rear of Ims had liisjlil
voice and eyes were tender, "will you
wed me?"
"They be noa parson t' Ragged Har
bor in winter," she said flushing.
"Sammy Arnold do be the oldest man
t' Ragged "Arbor." he said, quickly.
"He do be will' t' wed us two."
"Do he?"
'Tss, for a fair-sized fish, well salted.
He do be great on havln' bis flab
salted."
A ceremony performed by the patri
arch of the community waa all that
convention, demanded.
"Won't your* he pleaded, "Bure. Til
have the Bishop f do it over, when he
do come this summer."
Still she hesitated.
"Woan't you. 'Mella Mary?"
'Mella Mary's answer would not long
have been delayed had not young Jim
Rldeout passed under the hllL singing
as he went:
For the song waa an echo of lighted
eyes and dusk, when an arm, encircling
her, had stirred a sweet disquietude
within, and she had wondered and
trembled and rejoiced; and this first
rapture is like a dream of heaven in
that, though It vanish in the press of
life, It never passes out of memory, but
returns again with uplifting power. So
the soul of 'Mella Mary was taken up
Into the cloudy places of sentiment, and
there It hovered, striving, striving with
Its crippled wings, to mount to the
glowing heights above, where true
love is: striving, striving, striving with
Its poor crippled wings.
The hope of Ellhu Gale was In deadly
peril; for on that glad night the arm
about the waist of the maid had not
been the arm of Ellhu Gale, to be sure,
but of young Jim Rldeout. Now the
song called back the dusk and the light
In the eye and the encircling arm. It
was, indeed, as though love, all-glorious,
finding a hut in a wilderness, knocked
on the door, and waited and waited and
in compassion knocked again, being
loath to leave, thus turned away.
In came about, later In the day, that
'Mella Mary made some errand to the
Needle Rock, which Jim Rldeout must
pass on his way home from a search
of the ice for young seals; and when
Jim found her there he stopped to pass
a merry word or two; but she saw that
the hunt had once more been vain, and
she would not smile, for she could not,
"Do they be a west wind oomln',
Jim?" she asked, anxiously.
"Sure, I doan't know," said Jim.
"Is you sure?"
"They be none t* my mind," ho an
swered.
"Is you hungry?" she said, aftar a
silence.
"Uh-huh. Is your*
"Uh-huh. Barb'rous.**
"Billy Luff f your house last even'?**
he asked in a shamefaced way.
"Iss."
"Did un leave someâsomethingâfrom
me?" She nodded.
"Caplln?"
"Uh-huh, Two."
"Did you eat unr**
"Issâall," with a sigh,
"Was they good?" he asked, grinning
broadly. She nodded emphatically.
"Wasn't they, though!" Jim burst
out. His face shone with a smila He
smacked his lips as though he, too, had
had a part in the feast on those two
little fish, which, being young, were
not much larger than well-grown sar
dines. "I found they two caplln t'
Aunt Phoebe's stage loft. They wasn't
noa moare."
"They be fish t' Ragged Harbor,** she
said, abruptly.
"Who has un?" hs demanded.
"An' flour, an' potatoes, en'âan'â
tea.'"
"Who has un V he cried. "Sure, an'
Til get you f*
"Ellhu Gale," she said. Quietly. "They
be enough for two."
Jim's grasp of the situation was not
â low to coma He perceived that Ellhu
had made offer to sell for the maid her
self.
"Be you goain' f wed un. 'Mella V
he asked.
She looked at the ground. The sound
of his voice had changed all of a sud .
den. and that which had come into It
was sad, and she could not look at
him.
"Be you, girl?"
She kicked at a stone la the path
and this was all that broke the Tflenoe"
" 'Tis all they be t* do." said he, per
suasively. "Wed un, girl, sura do, now
âdo."
'Mella May turned away. Bo began
to coax her to cast him offâthat she
might gain Ellhu and his fish, for he
would make no complaint of the hurt
he suffered.
"Woan't you please, 'Mella?** he
pleaded.
"Tss," said she. )
"Sure," Jim sighed. f
So, in the evening, 'Mella Mary, who
was beloved of all the youth of Ragged
Harbor, sought out old Elihu Gale, in
his cabin near the Staff, and said that
she would wed him. Now the soul of
Ellhu, for the once and for the moment,
was lifted from its sodden estateâ
from a waste, slimy and dreadâto
those ethereal gardens where tender
ness and grace and reverence bloom,
and all the paths are sunlit and fra
grant* where, Indeed, though men care
not, all souls 'may dwell continually,
by leve of love, which holds the golden
key.
Ellhu Gale lifted up his face, moved
by love to look to high planes, and
vowed that the little children of
Ragged Harbor should no more suffer
for lack of potatoes and flour, but that
their hunger should be satisfied for the
sake of their laughter, which he de
aired to hear, and the rod blood In
their cheeks, in which his eyes could
delight; whence it may appear that the
seed which had fallen Into a crevice of
his craggy heart and there sprouted
Into living green was, after all, the
seed of a plant with a flowerâa tiny,
puny, lonely blossom; but yet a blos
som, which Is a grace the hearts of men
may lack.
Each succeeding spring had found
the heart of young Jim Rldeout re
sponsive. No exception this; when, in
good season, spring advanced and the
fishes swam the sea again, ha sighed
and fell In love with another maid,
and wed her out of hand; and flowers
bloomed without and within the cot
tage he builded under Quid Nunc,
where the tickle rocks disclose the
florid sunsets; and he lived happy over
afterward.
The heart of Jim Rldeout was no
hear\ to* Â»tragedy^rr UST about the meanest trick
#Â»\ nature can play a woman
Is to give her a thin
scrawny neck. One of the
kind that refuses to wear a
low evening frock and that
even objects to a dainty trans
parent yoke. Heavens! What
a bugbear these necks and
shoulders are and how many
an unfortunate possessor of one
has cried herself to sleep be
cause she could not go as other
girls and look as fetching or as
Wholesomely sweet.
And there is no use denying
that low gowns are by far the
prettiest for evenings. The girl who
looks well in the glare of artificial
light is a great deal more attractive
when her head Is set on a satisfactory
looking neck that can bear the closest
scrutiny. At all times she may be
pretty, but in the ballroom she is radi-
ant and positively exhales a lt-is-good- (
to-be-alive feeling.
Judging from the number of letters (
chat come In it would seem that thin- .
ness causes more woe than almost any- 1
thing else, yet it is a grievance that .
can be routed with work, but mind you, j
It must be systematic hard work and ,
ft cannot be accomplished in the twin- ,
kllng of an eye.
There are three rules to carefully fol
low, and they are, first exercise, second ,
exercise and third exercise. It Is no ,
unusual thing to see a man or woman
with a splendid head connected to the
body by a weak, slender neck, and ,
never do you fall to wonder why so
grood a head accomplishes so little, and
there Is always a tinge of regret at the
lack of the eternal fitness of things.
Begin by using the tape measure, for
you will be able to tell then of your in
creasing power. Do not despise this In
significant looking little tape, for it pos
sesses a marvelous eloquence and, more
than this, it possesses the secret of
your advancement.
There are two methods used to de
velop the neck and I will give them
both, for sometimes too much of a good
thing Is distinctly tiresome and it may
be as well to alleviate them now and
then.
Fashion a bag of some description
and try to balance and carry it on your
bead, a bag of sand, for Instance, or
some other rather yielding substance.
Of course, you cannot expect to make
any great headway with it at once, but
tramp about the house or room with it
for a certain time a day and see what
will happen to the muscles of your
neck. At first they will rebel most de
cidedly and cry out lustily In their in
dignation at being so unceremoniously
and ill treated, but In a remarkably
short time they will settle down to
work and will respond very quickly.
And let me tell you a secret right
hereâprofessional trainers say that no
part of the body answers as readily
and satisfactorily and that six weeks or
two months will put on enough weight
and muscle to make a goodly showing.
If you doubt the weight system look
at the wome.. of Southern Europe and
see what a splendid example they set.
Every day the fruit venders carry a
heavy weight on their heads and with
ease too, and certainly no one could
say they had other than fine, shapely,
well-made necks.
The other system is a rotary one and
a very simple, effective one at that.
Turn your head slowly as far around
as you can. Then do it the other way,
and do It many, many times every
day. Next tip your head backward
slowly, Just as far as you possibly can,
and as often aa you can, and when
you are tired of this movement draw
your chin In hundreds of tlmea if you
have the patience, for this Is one of
the best exercises you can find for the
neck, and it has one more good point
in Its favor, too, for It will aid won
derfully In giving you a splendid car
riage.
There is one more exercise that may
be taken with profit, but somehow or
other it never seems to find much favor
with feminine would-be athletes.
Every morning and night and any
time ior
that matter
lie on your back
and rest on your
head and heels. Ou
nothing else, mind you. Of course,
you will not stay there long, and you
couldn't If you wanted to; let your
muscles get a good pulling and you
will be better off all around for It. By
the way, this is called "The Wrest
ler's Bridge," for until you make both
shoulders of a wrestler touch the
ground at once you have not thrown
him.
Sometimes there are hollows In the
shoulders that are anything but pret
ty, and even If the neck Is filled out
the low necked gown Is still somewhat
of an impossibility. Dumbbells or
some other weights are needed for this
work, and while I think of It the best
authorities say never to use a dumb
bell that weighs over one-thirtieth of
what he or she does who uses them,
for then they are too heavy for steady
and systematic exercise and the pre
scribed half-hour Is almost an eternity
and the worker nothing more or less
than a martyr to a very bad cause.
Do not Imagine that dumbbells are an
absolute necessity either, for any small,
compact body of the same weight that
can be grasped and handled easily will
do quite as well, for Instance, cobble
stones or window weights, In fact, al
most anything, for where there is a
will there is a way, and if you really
mean to train these muscles until they
are strong and just what you want
them to be you will find the way sur
prisingly easy.
Stand erect and carry the dumbbells
at the sides easily. Now carry them
slowly backward and upward until the
hands are as high as they will go. Hold
them there a minute and then drop
them slowly to the sides. Keep this up
until you begin to feel like stopping,
but do it carefully, so that you may
note the spot when you feel it, and you
will find that the under muscle of the
part of the back arm which Is abovs
the elbow, those on the shoulder blade
and the large musclea of the back di
rectly under the arms have been the
ones in action.
Next put one dumbbell down and re
peat the same movement with the re
maining one, say, In the right hand.
This time place the left hand on the
back Just under the right arm, or on
the upper muscle of the right arm. Ths
result will be you will find these mus
cles vigorously at work and hardening
more and more the higher the bell Is
carried or the longer It Is held up.
A little of this work dally, begun
with a light dumbbell and Increased
gradually by adding to the number of
strokes and the length of the exercise,
will decidedly Increase the strength,
size and shapeliness of the back and
shoulders, and every hollow that seem
ed like a yawning cavern will be en
tirely filled up.
So, girls, stop brooding over the aw
ful calamity of being thin and possess
ing bones that will persist In coming to
the front and get down to hard work,
for If you will be steady and persevere
at it long before the year Is out you
will not only be a surprise party to
your friends, but to yourself as well.

M. A. J. (shampoo)â Melt a cake of

the result will be almost a jelly. Take
of this Jelly say two large tablespoon

ANNIE (rough ekln)âEvidently you
are one of the few girls who cannot
use cold creams and skin foods. If
your skin is rough after using it you
may make up your mind that it dis
agrees with you and the quickest cure
is to let it alone. Instead try a little
sweet almond oil, slightly perfumed
with attar of roses or bergamot every
night after washing. It should be well
massaged in and the face then gently
wiped with a soft rag or towel until
all superfluous oil Is removed.

MAY BLOSSOM (Rainbow Dresses)â
â¢.Rainbow gowns may be fashioned In
two ways. The Japanese fashion a
lovely crepe that comes In all colors
and is called "rainbow crepe." The
background is white and the rays ex
tend In various colors blended softly
and prettily &b these queer little brown
people alone can blend them. That is
one style of "xalnbow dresses." The
other Is made, say, for Instance, of red.
The outer skirt is of red and there are
a variety of colored linings varying
from pinks to reds and from yellow to
cream. A very thin rabric Is used to
get the desired effect and for evening
wear such gowns are very pretty. If
you are heavy I should advise you to
do without the skirts and make a fluffy
ruffle of the various colors and use
them Instead of the entire linings.
MRS. E. M. B. (pure soaps)â There
are any amount of soaps in the market
these days, but not very many that I
could honestly tell you to use. Pure
"white castile soap is the very best
there is and it is splendid on account
of its healing, cleansing qualities. It
Is possible that it may not agree with
your skin and if such is the case either
write to me and give me your address,
so that I may send you the names of
certain soaps or make the following:

FANNY (Curtains)â You say you have
a hard time keeping blue curtains and
blue linen for your room. Now I am
going to tell you how I manage to
keep my room blue and fresh and clean
at the same time. Swiss and thin
fabrics tear too easily and embroidered
pieces were rather top much of a lux
ury to keep in good condition, so I In
vested In some glass linen. Plain, or
dinary everyday glass toweling with
bars of blue about an lncn apart. This
I hemstitched all the way around and
finished by putting a scroll pattern on
it which I worked in a darK blue rope
silk. You can have enough of these to
change frequently and they stand any
amount of washing. The curtains I
fashioned of the same stuff and hem
stitched them also. They are sash cur
tains and are on a small brass rod.
Then I took some nurse's blue cotton
material In straight lengths and fin
ished them with full ruffles down one
side. These were for the long curtains
to be draped over the shorter ones and
when they were held in place with a
blue cord they looked quite fit This,
as you see, is a very simple arrange
ment, but It Is an easy one to keep
fresh and wholesome and it is the only
thing I have found that can visit the
tub frequently and still retain any of
its color.

IBABELLE (The simple art of using
flowers indoors) âEvery one appreciates
the charm and sense of luxury created
by the presence of flowers in a room.
But unfortunately in this clime only
the rich can have flowers always.
There are ways, however, for the per
son of moderate means to get around
this financial difficulty.
In the first place. It is not necessary
to have a great number of flowers in
order to decorate a room beautifully.
The Japanese, who are past masters in
decoration, and make a special study
of flower arrangementâit is a part of
every Japanese girl's educationâhave
discovered the secret, which is, simply
to- study and reproduce as nearly as
possible the natural growth of the
flower. Two roses, or a single rose,
with Its leaves untouched (they will
not cost more than ten cents apiece)
are often more beautiful in a rather tall
vase in Just the right place In the room
than the most extravagant bunch of
American Beauty roses.
For those whose income will not per
mit the indulgence in cut flowers, there-
Is still the luxury of growing plants;
and the feeling about a plant la very
Interesting. There is a sense of owner
ship, of friendship. Every one who has
had a growing plant and cared for it
knows the kind of affection that one
comes to feel for It. Indeed, the fact
of having to care for It is probably
partly the reason for the affection. And
they must be cared for. A dear old
lady who is most miraculously success
ful with growing things always said,
"They have to be cared for like little
children."
And caring does not mean only wa
tering. It is Important that plants
should have plenty of earth, plenty of
air, plentyâbut not too much âwater,
and as much sunshine as possible If
they are plants that require sunshine.
All plants should have their leaves
washed. In the case of the thinner
leaved plants It is sufficient that the
water be dashed or sprinkled over
them. But palms, rubber plants and
ivies should have each leaf washed
separately, they should be washed with
a sponge soaked in a weak solution of
borax water (one teaspoonful of borax
in a pitcher of water). More than that,
the jars that hold the plants should be
washed with the same solution In order
to frustrate the destructive intentions
of agile insects.
The plant that is appropriate and de
corative in one place may not be so In
another. Palms, which, properly cared
for, should live Indefinitely, are among
the most decorative plants. They are
on the whole the most appropriate
plant for the parlor or sitting-room.
But they, too, need to be kept clean
and the best and simplest method is
the weekly wash In tepid borax water.
This will Invigorate the palm, destroy
lice or insects of any sort and act as
a cosmetic on the plant leaf.
Geraniums are always charming for
a window box, either within or outside.
There is something Joyous and gay
about them in the sunny window, and
even the north window is more cheerful
for their presence. But they are not at
all the thing for the parlor Jardiniere;
this is not only because they are not
adapted in style to such use. but also
because they will not bloom and flour
ish without daylight. Ferns, however,
will thrive in the interior of a room, and
a fern is beautiful and appropriate al
most anywhere. The white Japanese
lilies (narcissus) growing In water from
the bulb are charming in the right spot
with the right kind of a flat Japanese
dish and right kind of little stones to
hold them upright. They are best near
the window, but not directly In the
sunshine. They are well placed In a
north window. Their exquisite fra
grance is an additional charm to all
save those to whom flowers with a
positive fragrance are objectionable.
Easter lilies are delightful used In the
same way- Azalea bushes are delight
ful In light-colored rooms, but they are
seldom long-lived. Plants of English
violets are also lovely while they last,
which Is longer at least by many days
than the cut flowers.
The possessor of a bay window room
can make a charming effect by training
about it an English Ivy.A MIRROR
Held to Gmr Traits
A FTER all. what variety of curlos
/\ ity is more imperious than that
* â¢* which impels us "to see our-
selves as others see us"? Self
pride, self-love, aye, the secret self
doubting, all clamor for the frankly
spoken opinion of another, even though
that opinion may ruffle our compla
cence grievously. As with an individu-
al, so with a nation. Our own country
particularly has still the sensitiveness
of youth to prick it up to a very Jeal
ous regard to the criticisms of older
brothers across the water; sometimes
we defy with a peculiar youthful trucu
lence any or all of the old world to find
aught to carp against in our "glorious
institutions" and then we take the in
evitable and not always good-natured
exposition of our shortcomings with a
penitent meekness. Not long ago Pro
fessor Hugo Munsterberg, a German
savant, occupying a chair at Harvard,
wrote a particularly sharp and search
ing review of our national weaknesses
which he called "American Traits." It
was not a book of honeyed phrase or
studiously courteous comment; it was
not a popular book. Later Professor
Munsterberg either repented or climbed
to a higher and wider vantage ground
of observation and wrote a second
book, "Die Amerikander," which was
designed to present the German peo
ple with a very optimistic, very gen
erous view of the American people.
This latter work has now been trans
lated into English by one of the pro
fessor's associates at Harvard and we
may now find our reflected Image In
another mirror, made in Germany.
In explanation of this round-about
method of presenting hie book to the
J American public Professor Munster
berg says that since the work had
originally been designed only as an
exposition of American traits for Ger
man reading its only claim to existence
, in the English lay In Its reflected char
acter, in Its having been written for
others and having come back from the
. old world to the new. Furthermore, he
makes this comment of extenuation for
past Â«ins, mayhap: "The role of critic,
i have played, perhaps, more often and
â more vehemently than is the foreign
â¢ er's right. My book on 'American
Traits* has been its sharpest expres
sion. Does that not give me, after all,
a moral right to supplement the warn
â¢ lng cry by a joyful word on the high
aims of true Americanism?"
Whatever load nis first book may
have imposed upon Professor Munster
berg's conscience, it is certain that in
his second he outdoes himself in com
plimentary reflections upon the worth
that lies under the superficial appear
ances of things American. From the
â¢ four broad, general considerations of
the spirit* of celf-direction, of self-initi
ative, of self-perfection and self-asser
tion the author Burveys the character
istics of American political institu
tions, American economic problems,
the culture of the. people and the
social life and' conditions obtaining
here. Professor Munstarberg's review
" is analytic rather than synthetical.
He believes that from the fundamental
-democracy pervading all of
our institutions, whether political,
economic or social, can be traced the
- peculiar genius of American traits.
The same strong principle of democ
racy or individualism that sanctioned
a republican form as the only right
form for our government has built up
the peculiarly distinctive economic
force that Is ours; this spirit of free
f>elf-guldance permeates the culture of
the nation, regulates Its social at
mosphere. This Intense individualism
of the American Is sui generis, an in
â¢ herent and not a reflected force. Illus
trating this fact from the inception
or our political ideas, the writer says:
"When In any people the desire of
self-direction dominates all other mo
tives, the form of government of that
people is necessarily republican. But
it does not conversely follow that every
republic Is grounded in this spirit of
.. self-direction. Hence it is that the
republic of the United States is so en
tirely different from all other reoub
lies, since in no other people is the
craving for self-determination so com
pletely the informing force. * * *
The French republic is founded on
rationalism. The philosophy of the
eighteenth century, with its destruc
tive criticism of the existing order,
furnished the doctrines, and from that
seed of knowledge there grew and still
are growing the practical ideals of
France. But the political life of the
United States sprang not from rea
soned motives, but from ideals: it is
not the result of insight but of will;
It has not a logical but a moral foun
dation. And while in France the prin
ciples embodied in the constitution
are derived from theory, trie some
what doubtful doctrines enunciated In
the Declaration of Independence are
merely a corollary to that system of
moral ideals which is indissolubly
combined with the American char
acter."
It must be believed ythat this weigh
ing of the whole of American character
from one standard leads the author
into error. The impulses and main
springs of our thought and action cer
tainly have their rise from more than
the fundamental spirit of democracy.
An example of the distortion that comes
from Munsterberg's application of a
ccver-all theory may be found in Jus
remarks anent the inspiration for
money getting in this country. Says
he:
"The American merchant works for
money in exactly the sense that a
great painter works for money; the
high price which is paid for his picture
is a very welcome indication of the
general appreciation of his art; but
he would never get this appreciation if
he were working for the money instead
of his artistic ideals. Economically to
open up this gigantic country, to bring
the fields and forests,, rivers and moun
tains into the service of economic pro
gress, to incite the millions of Inhab
itants to have new needs and to satisfy
these by their own resourcefulness, to
Increase the wealth of the nation, and
finally economically to rule the world
and within the nation Itself to raise
the economic pewer of the individual
to undreamt-of importance, has been
the work which has fascinated the
American. And every individual \as
felt his co-operation to be ennobled . v
his firm belief in the value of such an
aim for the culture of the world."
Now Is it democratic enthusiasm for
the good of the whole nation that leads
a man to corner Amalgamated Copper
and to wreck hundreds of hi 3 fellows?
Does Mr. Rockefeller take reckoning of
the culture of the world when he pro
cures discrimination in favor of his oil
from the railroads?
professor Munsterberg's book is a
voluminous one and throughout an
interesting one. The exigencies of
space refuse to permit of more than
this very inadequate discussion of some
of Its salient features, the reviewer
must satisfy himself with an expression
of his belief that In Germany the book
will be more convincing than it is here
at home. Perhaps we ourselves know
that Professor Munsterberg has been
just a shade over-kind to us In some
of his' deductions.

STAR
Guide for Amateurs
TWO years ago I was leaning
across the counter of a cigar
store over in Berkeley listening
to the reading of a poem. The lines
were addressed to the unknown mys
teries of the starry universe; their
author, like Stevenson's Prince Flori
zel, was a tobacconist whose soul is
attuned to things beyond the hedge of
en\ irons. At the end of the reading
there spoke up in comment .a little
mild mannered Englishman, a man
who piled his craft in a nearby shop.
Between the three of us there ensued
a discussion and then It was I learned
that the little Englishman was writ
ing a Beries of books upon the sci
ences. He said that he had three oil
cans full of manuscript and that he
hoped soon, to find a publisher.
"How to Know the Starry Heav
ens," by Edward Irving, came to my
desk last week and I mentally com
mented, "The first oil can empty."
Then I read the book as carefully and
as thoroughly as I could, skipping
only one chapter, which by Its array
of geometric figures and algebraic
formulae frightened my too timorous
â¢mathematical faculty. At the end I
made a resolve personally to urge Mr.
Irving to empty those other two oil
cans as quickly as the publisher's con
ven'ence could be met, for I believe
that such books as this ons first pub
lished are what the public wants. The
others of the promised series deal
with geology, biology and sociology.
If they succeed in giving the lay mind
r.uch a complete and vivid impression
of the fundamentals as thi3 .one does
Mr. Irving may congratulate; himself.
This is a work which is not a fjxt
book, but. as its author says, an In
vitation to text books- It is a
book for the casual reader, who
desires to acquaint himself with the
principles of astronomy without delv
ing into its Intricacies. Of all the sci
f nces astronomy probably presents the
sreatest difficulties In the way of a
popular interpretation, so indissolubly
is it linked with the profundities of
higher mathematics and so far re
moved from every-day thought and
common conceptions are Its principles.
Yet by the use of simple, most homely
demonstrations and by the artifice of
clothing the heaviest technicalities in
garments of poetic similitudes the au
thor of "How to Know the Starry
Heavens'' has made those very sidereal
wildernesses yield themselves to an
understanding on the part of the un
initiated reader which is comprehen
sive if not technically exact.
To gain at least a working knowledge
of the apparent motion of heavenly
bodies take two umbrellas, directs the
author, and bind their sticks together
so that the open envelopes will form a
rough globe. Then with the names of
the stars chalked upon the cloth In
rough correspondence to their heavenly
stations, and with the experimenter
taking his imaginary stand In the rlb
laced interior of this rough sphere,
revolutions of the machine will bring
convincing demonstration of principles.
Or again, to use another homely dem
onstration, the author directs that the
initiate suspend two potatoes, speared
on the opposite ends of a stick in the
manner of a balance: by shifting the
point of the center of gravity a differ
ence in the orbit of their respective rev
olutions will be noted: the relative
weights of the two potatoes will then
be determined, just as astronomers de
termine the relative weights of the
earth and the sun or of the earth and
Saturn. Thus does Irving make com
prehensible to the layman something
which were it to be read in the terms
of logarithms and differential calculus
would be as cryptic as Kipling's
"They."
By a series of quaint measurements
the writer harnesses the unthinkable
distances of star space by bands of
tangible proportions, thus: A spider's
thread Is so gauzy, says Irving, that a
pound's weight of it would probably
encircle our earth, yet to reach the
moon ten pounds of it would be neces
sary, 3712 pounds would only suffice to
reach the sun and it would take fifty
six, tons of this gossamer to bridge the
distance from our planet to Neptune.
Here Is work for Arachne, Indeed.
Mr. Irving is not so snuffy a scientist
but that a bit of the poet will out.
Drawing inspiration from George Sterl
ing's beautiful "Testimony of the
Suns," the author hitches his chariot of
Imagination to a far-flinging star and
carries us up with him to watch the
tremendous processes of cosmic manu
facture from birdseye vantage. Of
course, the orthodox astronomer may
decry this infusion of Imagination into
dry-as-dust, but the barbarian reader,
who knows not the language of science,
finds it in his heart to appreciate the
beauty of Irving's guide book to star
space, which pictures the titanic erupÂ»
tion of worlds and the burning of whole
hemispheres of nebulae as stereopticon
views cast on a screen. One who can
give even* the least tangibility to the
infinite mysteries of the universe does
much.

NOVEL
Of Ku Klux Klan
({ HE CLANSMAN," by Thomas
I Dixon Jr., has the distinction of
being the first novel of 1905.
Perhaps it is more than a coincidence
that as Ellen Glasgow's powerful story
of early post-bellum days In the South.
"The Deliverance," was the first book
of 1904, so this dramatic novel of the.
Reconstruction ushers in the new fic
tion season. Its appearance, more
over, has a definite significance in that
it reveals the large purpose of the
aufhor; for now it may be seen that
Dixon's earlier book on the South,
"The Leopard's Spots," was the first
of a series which has for Its motive
the still troubled race problem. The
initial book of the series gave a pic
ture of the enfranchisement of the
negro and the early developments of
the Reconstruction; this second one
carries the story along to the consum
mation of the radical propaganda for
the elevation to supreme power of
the blacks and finds its climax in the
terrible resistancs of the Ku Klux
Klan.
A daring book Is "The Clansman"â
a daring and a powerful one. Daring,
because the author handles without
gloves men and Issues of a past dec
ade, upon which history is supposed
to have passed the final and definitive
word. Powerful, because he has
coalesced the scattered elements of
causation and result marking- the Re
construction at its apogee into a tense
record of fact almost epic in its
strength of irresistible movement. And
besides this the novel's spirit is parti
san, at times bitterly partisan. Of
course this latter characterisation is
used advisedly. The word partisan is,
after all, but a comparative term, for
individual Judgment must determine
Its applicability as individual con
science or conviction dictates. All
will not accept my opinion in this
case.
Dixon opens his story with the re
ceipt of the news of Lee's surrender
in Washington, then he immediately
Introduces the character whoss evil
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
genius is supposed to be responsible
for the whole record of oppression and
tyranny that marked the course of
the- Reconstruction. With scarcely a
wisp of disguise Dixon characterizes
Thaddeus Stevens, the radical leader
of the war Congresses, as a revengeful
Moloch and implacable Titan whose
insensate desire for revenge would
glut Itself upon the very vitals of the
conquered South. History records
that Stevens was first among the
friends of the negro at Washington
and that the fourteenth amendment
and the laws making it operative in
the South were largely of his inspira
tion, but it does not sanction the stand
Dixon has taken in centering upon the
initiative of this brilliant Pennsyl
vunian Congressman a propaganda of
extermination and anarchy which
would make autocratic Russia blush.
This he does, however, thls'and more:
he invests Stevens with plenary powers
such as no dictator ever held and
makes him the mainspring of all the
nefarious carpetbagging and petty
tyranny Uiat disgraced administration
in the conquered South In the early
days of the Reconstruction. His angle
of vision is distorted throughout the
whole book by .this obsession to a par
tisan spirit.
Though Dixon has pictured with
great strength the rage of the North
at the assassination of Lincoln, the
struggle between Congress r.nd Presi
dent Johnson and the highly drama
tic incident of the impeachment, the
real force in his novel is not developed
until the scenes shift to South Caro
lina and the actual processes of the
Reconstruction are displayed. In de
picting the unbearable oppression of
the military quartered throughout the
South, the arrogance and effrontery of
the negroes, glorying in new-found li
berty, and the distracting state of in
security haunting the impoverished
people of the lost cause, the author
touches the highest reaches of drama
tic narrative. Even the revelation of
all the mystery and terror surrounding
the operations of the dreaded Ku Klux
takes second place beside Dixon's de
lineation of the shadow that fell from
the "Black Hand."
Though two love stories find place
in "The Clansman" the author is too
greatly engrossed in the epic swing of
national movements to give great heed
to lovers' sighs and moonlight woo
ings. In fact, the fiction of the book
itself is subordinated to truth, strang
er than fiction. Stoneman (Thaddeus
Stevens) is the only character that is
intensively developed, and upon the
operation of the machinations attrib
uted to his perverted genius hangs
the whole tale.
A compelling book this, strong in
its sincerity as in its bias, written with
trerneudous conviction, even though
not convincing.

PRACTICE
of Self-Culture
w tNFORTUNATELY humanism has
ml been for so long the favored field
for religious cant and philosophi
cal charlatanism that the weight of
prejudice Inevitably arises against a
book such as Hugh Black's, "The
Practice of Self-Culture," even before it
is read. Again, the term self-culture is
bound to carry its own condemnatien
to those wearied by the dilettante
efforts of blatant seekers after the
higher lifeâthe faddists and enthus
iasts whose voices are raised in, Pha
risaical rejoicing over their emancipa
tion from the chains of this world's
banalities. This book deserves, how
ever, attention awarded to sincere and
careful effort even though the conten
tions set forth by the author are for
the most part in the realm of the ideal
and not commensurable with practical
working schemes of life.
In a word, the Rev. Hugh Black's
plea is for self-culture or the broadest,
most evenly balanced type, which may
avail the individual soul greatly but
profit the wider sphere of society more.
Indeed, for him the highest service of
culture Is the social service; Individual
desires for the perfection of the spir
itual life must efface themselves before
the communal demands of "the social
organism." This lesson he would
preach and one other: the need of per
fect balance in the education of the
various faculties of mind and heart,
a unity of the personal life. "The
great task In life." says the author,
"lies In the harmonious unity ol
opposltes. We need true proportional
development, concurrent growth in
the different directions open to us,
physical, mental, moral, spiritual. The
practical problem lies in what place
to give each function, and how to com
bine them In the unity of character."
Perfect self-culture must have foi
its fundamental prerequisite our bellel
in the oneness of all the diverse parts
of our complex life. Between oui
physical being and our intellectual and
spiritual life we must recognise mutua
interdependence: likewise the various
components t)f the mental activities
reason, faith, imagination, conscienct
must be regarded as correlative If w<
would realise the highest perfection ol
life. With these relations once recog
nised, then It is our duty to advanc<
along the paths of education cautiously
bringing to each attribute of th<
mental life just that amount of cultur*
which will perfect it without disturb
ing the balance Imposed by thi
demands of the remaining faculties
"We may And means to cure folly, bu
none to reclaim a distorted mind," sayi
Rochefoucauld. Not so, according to
Black. If a man's mind be distorted by
too great Intellectuality, let him devel
op the powers of the heart, pity,
charity, love, and he will be madÂ«
whole again.
The fallibility of this writer's theo
ries comes directly to the test in ths
consideration of culture and special
ism. Realizing that his tenet of the
perfectly equalized distribution of cul
ture does not lump with the facts oi
human experience, the author seeks to
modify his premise accordingly.
"Sound and complete mastery of a
subject implies a deliberate disregard
of other branches of knowledge," says
he. This disregard of other avenues
of culture courts a narrowness of In
tellectual view, an overbalancing of
the components of perfect education.
One who permits of this does not de
his whole duty to "the social organ
ism." Good; but shall we say of New
ton that because he could not write an
od3 to the apple that hit him upon the
nose, his elucidation of the theory of
gravity was only half a duty to soci
ety: or must we condemn as recreant
In his obligation to his fellow man him
whom we hall as the discoverer of
America because his knowledge of
navigation and geography outbalanced
a love for the tragedies of Euripides!
The author admits that he cannot
carry his argument to a logical con
clusion, and temporizes thus: "The
student whose mind Is full of a sub
ject finds help everywhere; almost
every book he reads seems to have
bearings on his subject and no branch
of knowledge comes amiss. It Is sure
ly possible after all to avoid the two
extremesâthat of a man who gives up
the general for the particular, and that
of a man who lives with vacuous gen
eral interests and with no hold of par
ticular knowledge. The Ideal Is cer
tainly the general along with the spe
cialâknowledge of many, mastery of
one."

SAMUELS'
New Dramatic Poem
THE roll of poets whom San Fran
cisco claims as her own haa re
cently been swelled by the ad
dition of Maurice V. Samuels* name.
The most pretentious of all poetical
efforts Is the one which he has es
sayed: "The Florentines," a play In
blank verse. Is his first published
achievement.
Mr. Samuels, who has been study
ing In Europe for a considerable pe
riod since his graduation from the
University of California, has evidently
obtained a firm grasp upon the funda
mentals of his chosen work. "The
Florentines" is high class poetry ; It re
flects a fine scholastic sense, It
achieves excellence through an artis
tic spirit of repressionâa rare at
tribute of the productions of young
poets. Though this is in the strictest
sense a reading play, the subtleness
of its motive prohibiting actual dram
atization, the poet kept faithful ad
herence to the laws of dramatic con
struction and his production Is even
ly balanced, the primal motive well
sustained. The regeneration of a
man's sensual soul and the crystalliz
ation of his scattered talents into a
solid resolve of definite purposeâthis
is the theme that inspires Samuels'
dramatic muse.
The brilliant court of Cosimo de
Medici, art loving tyrant of old Flor
ence, makes the background for Sam
uels' play. Benvenuto Cellini, gold
smith and sculptor, is the character
that carries the plot development on
his shoulders. In his desire to find a
perfect model for his masterpiece the
erratic Cellini raises his eyes to the
divinely molded ward of his patron,
De Medici, even though common re
port has it that a model of Cellini's
inevitably gives more than her Image
to the sculptor. How, through the
cross-purposes of a man's love and a
woman's revenge the soulless Cellini
comes to find a soul and to find also
the destiny of his art is the story of
the play's denouement. The text of
the play Is in uniformly even end
smoothly flowing blank verse. The
one criticism upon the poet's dictioh
that can be made is that It is some
what too barren of color and lacking
in imaginative figures.
(Brentano't, New York.)
BOOKS
in Brief Mention
a LITERARY labor of more than
JX unusual 'Importance Is steadily
progressing in the appearance,
play by play, of the new "First Folio"
edition of Shakespeare's works. The
latest play to be issued is "Julius
Caesar." and. like its predecessors, it
commands attention on several counts.
This edition is the only one among
the many now available to go back
to the original First Folio text of If 23
and to preserve with strict fidelity the
plays as Shakespeare and his own edi
tors left them. Succeeding editors
for nearly three centuries have made
many changes in the text, omitting or
altering words and lines and chang
ing spelling and punctuation. Fre
quently this alteration changes the
meaning entirely, and it Is a curious
commentary upon such editorial meth
ods that no two versions agree as to
what Shakespeare really wrote. In
such a dilemma it would seem to be
but simple justice to return to the
original; and this the present editors
have done. The only change they
have made is to reset the old text in
modern type. All editorial changes
or suggested readings are placed
where they should have been all
alongâln the notes. Thus the true
text Is easily followed by every reader
who desires to know his Shakespeare
in the original, and not as some Inter
vening editor would have him known.
"Julius Caesar" also deserves atten
tion because it presents a wealth of
critical matter, making it a true vari
orum. The editors, Charlotte Porter
and Helen A. Clarke, who edited the
'Camberwell Browning," have con
tributed a preface, an Introduction,
literary frontispieces from rare edi
tions, notes discussing its argument,
sources, duration of action, date of
composition and early editions, lit
erary Illustrations, glossary, variorum
readings and selected criticism.

"Trie College Girl In America," by
Mary Caroline Crawford, la a book
well meriting the publishing. It Is not
the author's intention to bring out un
der covers long disquisitions upon the
value of co-education or the place of
the college bred girl In the world be
yond academic walls, but to reflect the
life and atmosphere that characterises
the representative women's colleges
and co-educational universities in the
country. This done, the reader may the
better decide for himself whether or
not a girl profits by the three or four
years spent in the shadow of some
"fostering mother" of learning. The
private colleges, Smith, Wellesley, Bryn
Mawr and the rest, are each given a
special chapter by the author, in which
details of the social life and individual
college customs obtaining are outlined.
In the general consideration of co
educational Institutions the writer pays
brief notice to tt>e leading universities
where women are, admitted upon equal
standing with men, giving special at
tention to the provisions made in each
for the social welfare of the women
students and the aids to self help.
The author sums up the results of a
college education for girls very sensibly
when she concludes her book with the
observation:. "Women's real Interest
and happiness do not consist In the
number of lines that draw from the
home to the outside world} but In the
multitude of avenues by which she may
bring the best from the world without
to Illuminate home."

So suddenly has the fad of jiu-jitsu
training; sprung into favor both In this
country and England that the favored
few who claim expertness in the intri
cacies of the science find themselves
hard put to it to provide clamoring
athletes with texts. Not only has Mr.
Irving Hancock written four books
upon the subjectâand probably sold
them, which Is more to the pointâbut
a Japanese teacher of the art, Mr. Tae
Kichi Yabe, whose school Is widely
advertised, has provided a work in
two volumes for the use of amateurs,
and one Captain Harry H. Skinner of
New York does the trick in one
volume. Of course for one who does
not know the first trick in Jiu-jitsu to
pass comment upon the work of these
respected "professors"âprofessors I
suppose they are since we credit bal
loonists and phrenologists with" that
titleâfor one thus inept to sit in criti
cal judgment would be presumptuous
at least. The uninitiated reviewer can
only say, then, that Mr. Yae Kichi
Yabe's "Jiu-Jitsu" In two volumes
seems to be complete to the extent of
being exhaustive and admirably ar
ranged for progressive lessons along
the lines of muscular development and
the art of self-defense. It seems 'that
a careful following of the directions
given in his work must be productive
of lasting benefit to the reader. Of
Captain Skinner's book as much can
not be said. The work barely skims
the ground covered by the Japanese
gentlemen's volumes and seems to be
designed chiefly as a ready reference
to be used in a barroom brawl or at a
picnic of the Amalgamated Scaven
gers' Protective Association.
Yabe's book is published by Clark,
Dudley & Co., Rochester, N. Y. Skin
ner's is brought out by the Japan
Publishing Company, American Tract
Society building. New York.
"Treasured Thoughts," a book of
verse by Jeffle Forbush Hanaford,
comes to me for review. I do not like
to review it because I am certain that
Mrs. Hanaford had to pay for the ex
pense of publishing it and that there
are many of her friends who might
think It ungentlemanly of me to say
anything in which they could not con
cur. May I not ask my Indulgent read
ers to take upon themselves the onus
of judgment If I submit one of the
poems from the collection, chosen Im
partially? Here is something, for ex
ample, which has to do with the heart
tragedy that occurred in a plumb line
with a certain chandelier:
They stand just under the chandelier,
The music sounds faint, the lights are
dim,
He whispers, "I love you," he has no
fear.
He feels so sure of her love for him.
She Is tall, and stately and full of grace.
And he is as dark as she is fair.
Her dress a marvel of silk and lace.
And diamonds gleam in her golden
hair.
Deepest surprise is expressed in her face.
She wonders if this is the way it will
end;
She doesn't see why he can't keep his
place,
And continue her most devoted friend.
She tells him this. In her winning way.
And tries to soften the blow she gives,
But he remembers for many a dayâ >
And perhaps to the longest day he
lives.
She hands him a rose, a good-by token.
He does not speak, yet she sweetly
smiles;
"lis only a man's heart breakingâ
broken
By* a thoughtless woman's witching
wiles.
He has gone. The lights were never so
dim,
The room Is empty, silent and drearâ
In her silks and laces, tall and slim.
Alone she stands under the chandelier.

DISHONESTY OF THE OFFICIALS RENDERS THE NAVY OF
RUSSIA WORTHLESS AS A FIGHTING FORCE.
r MONEY INTENDED FOR SHIPS
;, EMRICHES INDIVIDUALS.
' Vessels of War Constructed
. of Inferior Materials*
.. INCOMPETENT MEN ON BOARD
Â«
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 21. â Through those channels by means of
which Russian official secrets leak out it has been learned that there is
:y more the matter with the Russian navy than any one has suspected here
tofore, outside of a few persons connected with the Ministry of Marine.
â¢ Recent events have, of course, proved that, among both officers and men
of the Czar's fleet, efficiency and discipline are lacking to an almost unbe
.llevable extent, but heretofore there has been little reason to suppose that
\ % there was much wrong with the vessels themselves. j,lt is now said that
the condition of almost every ship of war flying the Russian flag is such as
to render it practically worthless as a fighting instrument.
'f\ Of this state of things the Czar knows nothing. Nicholas II still labors
under the delusion that he possesses a strong, modern, well organized,
well managed and thoroughly efficient navy which he could employ at any
time against the rival fleets of other first-class powers. His uncle. Grand
Duke Alexis, who is commander in chief of the entire Russian fleet, could,
however, open his imperial nephew's eyes if he chose to do so. One or two
other intelligent members of the Russian Imperial family have also a
â¢" strong inkling about the state of the navy, but the real facts are known
only to the small ring of high officials at the Ministry of Marine.
Nearly every member of this innermost circle of marine authorities
' draws an abnormally big income from the public exchequer for organiz
ing and controlling the navy and consequently every one of them is desirous
of concealing the truth about their own mismanagement, incapacity and
corruption.
Srait Among Officials High and Low.
There exists a deliberate conspiracy on the part of the small circle of
hiprh' marine authorities to deceive the Czar and the Russian nation regard
, inp the deficiencies in Russia's naval force. It is easy to hoodwink >.he Czar,
but the Russian public is no longer in the dark. "What is most important of
all "is that the whole truth about the Russian navy has become known to
the governments of all the other first-class powers, for every naval attache
in St. Petersburg has supplied his Government with full and complete de
â  â¢ '.tails of every weak point which can possibly be discovered in Russia's
.. .. marine armaments.
The fundamental cause oj the deficiencies in the Russian navy are due,
like many other evils in Russia, to the corruption which prevails among of
ficialdom of all classes. In Russia, where there is no public control over the
. . ' national finances, state officials are simply a combination of men whose
main object it is to enrich themselves as rapidly as possible at the expense
â of the taxpayers, groaning under the burden of ever increasing imposts,
r . 'A l'arpe proportion of the money set aside for naval purposes is never-spent
â¢â¢ on the fleet at ah. After a certain expenditure has been recommended by
the. Minister of Marine and approved by the Czar, the administration of this
fund passes into the hands of a succession of state officials, who consider
. that they are justified in appropriating oart of it for their own private
purses.
The high officials steal money from the public exchequer and allow
.their subordinates to follow their exatnpl- In order that their own misap
propriations may not be exposed to public view. The superiors know that
the inferiors are thieves and the inferiors are well aware that the su
periors are robbers, so that between them they form a limited company of
plunderers, who, however, have no cbnception whatever of the iniquity of
their proceedings. On the contrary, they consider plundering the public to
be one of their official privileges and they would probably be surprised if
they were told that their system of life is immoral. In their eyes the only
.essential point is that a public official must not permit himself to be de
tected in the act of appropriating public money.
Deficiencies Exist Throughout,
The result of all this corruption, expressed in plain figures, is that when
$5,000,000 is granted to the Ministry of Marine for the construction of a new
first-class battleship, not more than $4,000,000 is really spent on the battle
ship and often not more than $3,000,000. The balance finds Its way into the
pock' ts of numerous officials concerned in all the transactions connected
with the construction of a modern battleship.
The inevitable consequence is that the battleship turns out to be a less
valuable article than it was originally Intended to be. Its armor is of in
' ferior quality, its steel is not the best In the market, its wood is not fireproof.
Its boilers are defective, in brief, it shows numerous traces of unwise
economy. Even its guns are not as good as money can buy, but second
ctarss articles bought at reduced prices. As the result of the criminal
economy practiced the battleship can be more easily disabled through the
enemies' shells piercing its defective armor, while at the same time its sec
ond rate guns cannot hurl destruction at the foe with the necessary force
and speed.
The same thing in different forms is to be found in all departments .of
the Russian navy. When a Russian battleship is marked in books of
â¢ naval reference as able to steam sixteen knots an hour, It may be safely
.'â¢ assumed that Its actual maximum speed is twelve knots an hour. This
difference between theory and practice has been amply demonstrated
in the naval operations in the vicinity of Port Arthur, by the perform
Â° . ances of the Baltic fleet and by the results of recent naval maneuvers held
' In the Black Sea.
Another important cause of constructive deficiencies in Russian war
uS ships In the fact that all the Russian shipbuilding yards are full of work
r. men who are secret adherents of the extreme revolutionary party. In pur
suance of their destructive principles, these workmen deliberately Introduce
defects In the construction of warships. This is only possible to a limited
extent, owing to the supervision which is necessarily exercised. Neverthe
less, the damage done is the more dangerous because it remains concealed.
Bolts which should be absolutely immovable are left so loose as to endan
: . â¢ ger the solidity of the whole structure, and armor plates which should be
firmly riveted to the side of a ship are so carelessly attached that their de
â¢ ' 'fenslve properties are considerably decreased. Boiler pipes are purposely
constructed so badly that they must inevitably begin to leak soon after
the ship puts to sea, thus largely reducing its speed or disabling it alto
â¢ â¢ geth'er.
' â¢ Ridiculous Muddles at Maneuvers.
Mistakes of administration and defects of construction might be com
Â° ' pensated to some extent by unusual efficiency on the part of officers and
men of the Russian navy. So far from this being the case, the crass in
competence of Russian officers and sailors only add to the general worth
lessness of the Russian fleet
.' , A great sensation has been caused in St. Petersburg by a report drawn
up' by Admiral Tchuchnin, who commands the Russian Black Sea fleet, on
â¢ the subject of the recent naval maneuvers held under his supervision. Ad
miral Tchuchnin writes:
â¢ "I have found that the naval officers under my command are entirely
â " without love for their profession and without interest in their work. I
have found that incompetence prevails throughout the fleet. When ma
"heuvering, the officers were unable to handle their ships smartly. The
imost' appalling muddles occurred. Sometimes when the ships of the fleet
were, supposed io be in close formation several would be found to be miss
ing altogether', and cruisers had to b P detached to search for them. The
signals from the flagship were eithier misunderstood or purposely disobeyed.
.Many officers were totally ignorant of naval regulations."
In the same report, Admiral Tchuchnin goes on to mention several ex
amples of the extraordinary lack of discipline among Russian naval officers.
One night during the maneuvers the fleet was steaming in company when
.y torpedo-boat No. 273 suddenly turned and disappeared. The angry admiral
f dispatched a cruiser in chase and after a long search the missing torpedo
â¢ boat was found in the harbor of Yalta. The lieutenant in command and
his .brother officers as well declared simply that they preferred spending
the night in port rather than on the open sea. Two other torpedo-boats left
the fleet without the admiral's permission and were also found at Yalta.
They were tired of executing evolutions at night, and the commanders ex
pressed surprise and indignation when they learned in a somewhat forcible
manner that the admiral was distinctly annoyed.
THE M CALL
HORTICULTURE
IS ENCOURAGED
BY CARNEGIE
OFFERS PRIZE IN SCOTLAND
Coin for the Best Garden on His Estate.
Charity of American Wife of Lord
Cheylesmore.
LONDON, Jan. 21.âAndrew Carnegie has caused a new industry to
spring ud in the neighborhood of Skibo Castle. The cultivation of flow
ers and various species of plants is now engaging the active attention of
nearly all the tenants on his estate, in spite of the fact that at this sea
son much of the work has to be done under glass.
This horticultural development is due to a rather unusual incident.
Mrs. Carnegie's passion for flowers, and especially for different varieties
of roses, caused the Laird of Skibo to make the flower beds about the
castle the envy of all who saw them. Rose trees were introduced from
all parts of Europe and an expert gardener was appointed to look after
them. This man's duty was to devote himself exclusively to the culti
vation of roses, and so diligently did he comply with his master's instruc
tions in this respect that it was said in the neighborhood that he actually
sat up at night to watch the roses grow. .
En snite of all his care and vigilance some of the most beautiful va-.
rieties disappeared mysteriously, and after he had failed to catch the thief
he reported the matter to Carnegie. He was surprised, however, to see
a pleasant smile pass over the face of his master, when he expected an
angry reception, as a result of his communication.
"If my tenants are fond of flowers." said Carnegie, "it Is evident
that they are people of refinement."
The next day he issued a notice warning all against stealing his
roses, but inviting them to come and ask the gardener for what they
required. He also caused it to be known that he would give an annual
prize of $50 for the best cultivated and most artistically arranged flower
garden on his estate. The demands unon the horticultural resources of
the castle were immediate, with the result that the Skibo tenants are
now cultivating flowers both for pleasure and profit.
The coming decide who will win the 350 prize, and al
ready the little cottage are snowing evidences of the enormous
amount of industry that has been expended on them. Since it became
known that Mr. and Mrs. Carnegie were such enthusiastic tlowUt- lovers the
librarians of the various Cavnegie libraries throughout Scotland are grad
ually introducing a variety of (lowers and plants into the buildings and
where possible constructing flower beds outside
Another American has joined the lists of those who are spreading sun

HONOR IS PAID
OLDEST MEMBER
OF PARLIAMENT
Charrington Is Pre
sented With Silver
Cup for Devotion.
LONDON, Jan. 21âSpencer Char
rington enjoys the distinction of being
the oldest member of the British Par
liament. He is eighty-six years old,
but hale and hearty, as he proved a
while ago by sitting out an all night
session of.the House, which lasted
twenty-five and a half hours. His col
leagues showed their appreciation of
his vigor and devotion to public busi
ness by presenting him with a silver
cup, with an inscription commemorat
ing the occasion.
He is the senior partner In a great
brewery business and a rich man, but
not quite rich enough to reap the re
ward which wealth accumulated in
beer usually brings hereâa title. He
has a brother, F. N. Charrington, who
put himself entirely out of the running
for such honors by chucking up his
share in the brewery concern and do
ing his best to spoil it by devoting
himself to temperance and evangelical
work.
Spencer Charrington is none the less
popular in the House because he sel
dom inflicts a speech upon it, although
he never shirks a sitting. At other
times he is generally to be found at
tending to his business. He represents
an East London constituency in which
his brewery is the most conspicuous
landmark. As the largest employer of
labor there and the purveyor of Its
most popular commodity, he has a
tight grip on the seat in Parliament,
which he has held for eighteen years.
If some censorious moralists find fault
the source of his wealth, his
method of disposing of it meets with
their entire approval, for he has the
reputation of being a man of boundless
charity.
SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, JANUARY 22, 1905.
Mayor of Westminster, the historic London borough, and since his wife, the
former Miss French of New York, became Lady Mayoress, she has excelfed
all previous efforts in the way of charity. Lady Cheylesmore has devoted
much time of late to an Investigation of the conditions under which the poor
of her district live. Luckily for her Westminster is not overburdened with
exceptional poverty otherwise her philanthropy would be a heavy drain
upon her purse. She has actually explored some of the vilest slums in Soho
and relieved distress in every instance that came personally under her no
tice.
She is opposed to the system of dispensing: charity in actual cash, but
any one in need she strives to supply with food and warm clothing. Grasp
ing landlords are a source of much annoyance to her. In seVeral Instances
she has paid out the brokers' men rather than see poor people's little
homes broken up. She had a list prepared for her showing the number
of persons who were likely to lack a Christmas dinner. She said that no
home In the city of Westminster should want a dinner on that day. Her
system was to issue tickets which were accepted by certain local butchers,
bakers and grocers, and she insisted that only the best of everything must
be supplied.
In addition to her visits to the homes of the poor she takes an active in
terest In young girls who work In factories all over London, and on several
occasions she has made reports to the factory inspectors which have en
abled them to drop on employers who have been violating the provisions of
the factory act.
What a woman with means and Intelligence and broad sympathies can
accomplish in the way of promoting industries among remote communities
has been strikingly shown in the success that has rewarded Lady Victoria
Campbell's efforts on the Scotch island of Tiree. Some years ago she con
ceived the idea of teaching the young folk woodcarving at her own ex
pense. They showed remarkable aptitude for the work, and made such prog
ress that last winter the co-operation of the School Board was secured, and
woodcarving is in a fair way to become the most important industrial re
source of the people. This is largely due to the specialization of their
work'under Lady Victoria's guidance, which imparts to their products dis
tinctively Highland characteristics. Most of her patterns are taken from
the Celtic symbols found on the ancient tombs of the country. Some of her
"boys" have Just completed an exquisite oak pulpit as the gift of their ben
efactor to a new church In Tiree. Several orders have been received for
similar designs.

Bankrupt Earl Secures a Post
With Marlborough's Aid.
LONDON. Jan. 21.â1t waa due to the Duke of Marlborough's powerful
political pull that that Sightly but versatile nobleman, the Earl of Rosa
lyn, received the appointment of private secretary to the Secretary for
Scotland the other day. Before the Duke's marriage he and Lord Ross
lyn were great chums and shared many a good time together. After the
Duke's marriage and the change in his fortunes wrought by the share of
the Vanderbilt millions that accompanied it, they were much less often
together.
Under the stimulating influence of his ambitious American wife the
Duke settled down to the task of striving to make a position for himself
In the political world somewhat commensurate with the great name he had
Inherited. But he never lost an opportunity to urge his old friend to go
in for something serious, and has now induced him to try politics, and
has provided him with an opening. No salary attaches to the appointment,
but as the Earl has contrived for a long time to live comfortably on his
debts the lack of pay is not likely to cause him much inconvenience. Be
sides, the office is generally regarded as the stepping stone to a paid ap
pointment.
The Earl is well known In America, and has come before the public

San Francisco Tent will give a grand
ball in the Assembly Hall of the Pio

2a. This is to be an invitational and
conventional affair and the rule will be
evening dress.I as a matter of personality, doubt
. '.less, .but one expected to find a very
â¢ : tail | person In Signor Polacco. The
..'. new. Tlvoli conductor is an extremely
â¢ inspiring person at the desk, and six
; of- seveni feet of him away would not
.Surprise. But it was a gentleman of
" qwi.tf.modest Inches and build that put
trot -a slim hand to me last. Sunday in
â¢MAnafjer Leahy's office. He owned,
however,. the close cropped head and
; quit-k,'glancing brown eye of the con
' duc{6r, and Mr. Leahy's introduction
'. 'was a further Indorsement of identity.
.Two - minutes later one needed none.
â¢ ."Slgrior Polacco was by then in the
.tljick- of the modern Italian opera, his
' delightfully adventurous English lend
.' Jrig, piquancy and point to a distinctly
Illuminative discourse.
*. But-one must not keep the lady wait
ing.'* At Signor Pollacco's elbow, rosy
chee'ked, round of face as he is elegant
â¢â  'ly-.Â«pare, with shy, soft, long-lashed
black eyes, stood Signora Pollacco.
; -Dutifully, after her shy salutation, she
took a seat as far from the interviewer
â¢â¢and- Interviewed as Mr. Leahy's little
â . â  .office permittedâabout three feet, and
..sat 'there, her soft Italian eyes wor
ehipfully- following every movement of
. IÂ»fr distinguished "5p060." His own
r* glance sought hers frequently. Want
. tag--an English word in the midst of
ju. cataract of voluble, Anglo-Italian,
â¢wanting, perhaps to know just w hat I
had.said, Signor Polacco would turn
'to the brown-eyed lady as one sure
"of help. And in purest, prettiest Eng
:' JisH, .with quick Italian translation of
. any English problems, Signora Polacco
would furnish it. She explained very
modestly, however, that she know s only
Ger-man.
'.It:was "Manon"âthe Massenet "Ma
nori"âl think we began with. Massenet
the conductor regards as a "very big
man," perhaps the biggest of the
Frenchmen, nnd "Manon" as "very in
spirated" and original. Naturally one
came, to Puccini here with his "Manon
Lescaut," which opera the conductor
ranks Quite highly.
"I will tell you." Polacco said, lay
ing/a significant forefinger against his
iipse In a funny, eager little fashion
that'-he has, "I will tell you. I am dis
appointed of Puccini. I expect from
â¢him more. -La. Tosca,' where is your
'melody? Not much. 'Mme. Butterfly,'
tb*>'last opera, I think much of how
ever. 1 am convince it will be some
' <lay- regard as the best work of Puc
cini." It was not a success at La
Scala",' true. But wait."
â¢ .".Whom do you regard as the fore
most of the present-day Italian com
posers.?" I asked.
>h, for originality, Mascagnl," Po
lacco-replied, without the slightest hes
itation. "You have had his 'Ratcliffe'
herle? No? It Is a fine work. I con
'â du-uCed the premiere of it in Milan.
.Mascagni came, andâhe could not stay,
â jpbe- -train cameâhe sent me a great
â¢ telegram to congratulate. I like you
to" gee. Then there is, too, Franchetti,
true successor of Verdi."
â¢ ".Why did you not bring something of
his-for-us here?" I interrupted. "We
have had nothing."
"Wait." said Signor Polacco, "if I be
bo happy to come back to San Fran
ciscoâl hope I mayâl will bring you
. 'Germania.' Franchetti's music is very
aristocratic, noble. He has the Wag
nerian technique and the Italian gift of
melody. So large and noble phrase, so
easy of comâ comâ"
"Comprehension." Signora Polacco
â¢furnished. The Signora's interpolations
by the way showed a familiarity with
much more than English, in fact a wide
and sympathetic knowledge of music.
"Franchetti," the conductor con
tinued, a gracious nod wlfeward ac
knowledging his indebtedness, "Fran
chetti began much better than Wagner,
you remember. His 'Azrael' is power
ful, splendid, altogether finer than
â¢Rienzi.' the first opera of Wagner. His
' 'Columbus,' written for the fourth cen
tenary of the discovery of your Ameri
ca, is fine also."
Giordano, whose "Fedora" will be one
of the new operas this season, was not
mentioned, but Polacco gave high
praise to Cllea, whose "Adrlenne Le
couvreur" will be another of the novel
ties. Cilea's "L'Arlesienne" be cata
logued as "too triste, veryânostalgic,
but deleecious!" Mention of the nov
elties of the season brought us to Son
zogno, the Maecenas of modern Italy,
end the proprietor of the Lyric Theater
rival of La Scala, at which Signor Po
lacco when he is at home presides.
"We have not a false patriotism in
Italy,"-the conductor explained. "Mr.
Sonzbgno he opens the door to all
operas. I have conducted twenty-one

Qotyviviality Development \\) /Artists
An artist's work proclaims to the
world his personality. It tells how
he â¢ lives, what he eats and drinks,
what are his pleasures and who his
associates. It tells how much of ani
malism is pitted against the sensitive
and'spiritual and shows in terms as
unmistakable' as the grocer's scale the
varying weights of both, changing
each day according to the thoughts
and acts of that day. The gay nights
at the club, the mad nights at the stu
dio and the suffused, purplish days
that, follow are writ in the work NOT
done; likewise in that which IS done
rn\. the days when calm reflection
comes. It shows itself in a lack of
./-'attkck" and penetration and sponta
neity, three qualities that emanate
only" from a clean body and a chaste
soui : . Ah! What havoc these little
devils of mental and physical regret
haye wrought! When they invade the
.-studio the palette lies dry, the brush
Inert: and the ashes gray on the
f hearthstone.
Personal? Why, bless you, no. To'
be sure tltere are artist folk who are
i lured by the song of the siren to tar
ry awhile and wh6 sip the nectar that
the new operas, Saint-Saens. Charpen
tier and those all there. We like all
opera that is good; if French, yes; if
German, yes; if Italian Just the same
yes, not any more. For me! For me
lt is a very bad tradition that Italy is
the home of music. It is Germany,
Germany, for purest music."
"Then you regard the symphony as
the highest form of musicâAveil leave
out the music-drama?" I suggested.
"Yes, yes," Polacco said, with an
emphatic nod.
"And Beethoven as its prophet"âl
ventured to believe.
"It is so," the conductor eagerly ac
knowledged. "Always in symphonic
music I prefer the classic, and where is
it greater than with Beethoven? It is
the last word. I should like if the
press would ask, if It would assist me,"
he added with eager Ingenuousness, "to
give just one symphony concert here,
with a Beethoven symphony, or Men
delssohn, nnd some lighter worksâsay
the 'Invitation to the Waltz,' orches
trated by Welngartner. You have not
had it? Splendid thing."
"How does Strauss strike you?" I
asked.
"Strauss âI will try to express," Po
lacco began, slim forefinger flying to
his nose, eyes glinting anxiously. Then
he loosened the white silk muffler that
was keeping out the day's damp, threw
open his overcoat and in quick staccato
went at it.
"Strauss, his music, too realistic. He
tries to âto âmake pictures of things
that should not be pictured. Noble
emotions only should be illustrated in
musicâ"
"What of your 'La Tosca?' I inter
rupted.
"Ah," Polacco threw up his hands,
"it is the same. One should not make
illustration of basse passions like Scar
pia's. Music is not for that. The
Strauss music, La Tosca,' it is all very
rhetorical, very clever, imposing much
color, instrumentation most wonderful,
but is It music? Take 'Germania.'
L'amour pour la patrleâvous compre
nez?âest la motif, but there Is also
halne âhatred, you call it?âbetween
two friends. I will tell you. Two
friends there are In the story. One of
them has a sweetheart. The other
comes to abuse her. They then hate
each other and are going to fight. But
the moment fa patrie calls, they forget
all. So silentlyâquietly, I mean?"â
the conductor asked the signoraâ"the
composer tells about the hatred in the
music. Noâover-action, great noise,
wrong realism, it Is always music."
"Like Rossini's thunder and lightning
in 'The Barber,' " I supplemented, and
Polacco nodded lively assent.
We got down then to a bit of Po
lacco history.
"I began my career In London," he
surprised me with, "as assistant con
ductor at the Shaftesbury Theater. I
was some time there, and did once con
duct 'CavaUeiia' at Windsor Cas
tle "
"He conducted for the Queen," little
Mrs. Polacco put In, beaming all over,
forgetting her shyness in her pride.
Polacco laughed Indulgently at his
wife, but acknowledged the fact, then
went on: "After that I went to Rio
Janeiro, to assist Marino Manci
nelli "
"Ah, MancinelH," I cried; "Luigi's
brother, is it not? Thank you, sig
nor!"
" 'Thank you?' " the conductor re
peated, puzzled.
"You know I said that your conduct
ing reminded of Mancinelli's," I ex
plained, "you see I can say 'I told you
so ' "
Polacco did not understand this tiny
feminine gloat, but seemed satisfied,
as I was, and went on: "Manclnelli
was a great conductor. I like, I was
very much inamorata of him, my poor
maestro. He killed himself, you know.
His misfortune was my fortune. I
have his place for six years after."
"And then?"
Polacco rapidly put more of South
America on the operatic map for me
then with owning to four years' con
ducting in Buenos Ayres. He said of
the opera-house there: "The opera
house is most like that of New York
than any other that I know. Great
spectacle they make there, very splen
did. After, since then, I have been
three years in Milano. At the Lyric we
have, too, great mise-en-scene. It is a
passion with Mr. Sonzogno."
"Do you play at all yourself, signor?"
An expressive shrug illuminated his
"I play a little piano. But"âhe threw
out his hands â"when one has an or
chestra to play on, every instrument is
for baby! When one has an orchestra
In one's handsâoh, It is Just to lose
time to play anything else! I wish to
tell you"âhe interrupted himself with
springs from the breast of natureâand
why not? Whose Joy of soul lures
men of lesser gifts to bid for their
company and whose presence at the
feast gives the golden touch of "the
gods. All this is true, but think it
not, O friend, of the artist folk of San
Francisco. Ah, no! we of that town
do love them! Far be It from them, or
their foster-father, the Bohemian
Club, to encourage the discourage
ment of art by o'erfeasting or keeping
gay vigil with the dozing owl.
All these weird things are happen
ing to-day to some of the cleverest of
artists, and at the flood tide of their
abilities, throttling the best and
highest efforts of which their glow
ing genius is capable; but far be it
from me, poor gossip of the studios,
to attribute such abortiveness of art
to San Francisco. Let us blame it on

One does not wonder after seeing
and hearing Berlindi's Manon that the
soprano has been engaged to sing the
role with the famous Caruso next
spring in the French capital. It is one
of the pronounced hits of the sea
son, effective from all sides. Bazelli,

Instructing him in its necessities on
the occasion of the opera's first pre
sentation in Milan at the L-yrico. Ba
zelli counts a very pleasing abearance
and manner among his assets, and con
tributed considerably to both the dra
matic and picturesque illusion.
The whole performance of the opera
âI speak of Its first nightâranks with
the fine opening one of "Rlgoletto." It
showed the conductor, Signor Polacco,
In a new and again favorable aspect.
Spirit, abandon, magnetism one had
already found him amply possessed of,
but In "Manon" one discovered also a
charming conservatism, a finesse, an
elegance of conception, that added not
ably to one's opinion of him. Signor
Polacco should conduct Mozart admir
ablyâtoo bad we shall have noneâbut
there will be ample opportunity in the
operas to come for the exhibition of
all his varied capacities.
It Is unfortunate that the opportuni
ties for rehearsal have been so scant.
The performances, astonishing as they
are as a whole, are only sketches of
what might be. Neither conductor, or
chestra, soloists, chorus, have had fair
opportunity to show their abilities. It
Is only the long experience of opera
â¢that the Tivoll orchestra and chorus
have had that has made the perform
ances even possible. There is talk that
Signor Polacco will return next year,
and prelude his season with rehearsals
befitting the occasion. It is much to
be hoped that it is true.
It would not be a bad Idea, also,
for some one to get in and rehearse the
audiences. There are things to be
said for the Parisian claqueur. At least
he does not Intrude his noise upon the
heart of a solo or upon the orchestral
phrase that rounds it off, as do we.
The applausive interruptions this week
have bordered upon the ludicrous and
gone over the border. They have had
at times neither more rhyme nor rea
son than the shouts of the Central gal
lery when the hero thrusts a do-or-dle
hand Into the air. The action of the
opera has been slashed In two, its
logicâand heaven knows there Is little
enough to go roundâhas been utterly
lost. Neither have the singers helped
the situation as they might. They have
risen, Lazarus-like, from the dead, to
bow their acknowledgments; they have
gone through the agonies of double
farewells and generally played fast and
loose with the stories. Possibly the
enthusiasm will be a little more staid
this week, but last it lacked wonder
fully in judgment and place. It Is a
fact that we were ready for any and
every thing of opera, and this, so be
yond one's expectations, perhaps pro
nounces its own pardon for the extrav
agance of its greeting.

Is our smart set "smart?"
Well, we provincials rather think so.
It seems to line up just about as well
In good looks, style and behavior as the
gmart set of Gothamâwhich con
stitutes itself with superb self-confi
dence the social Nirvana of America.
But we are told by a recent New-
York visitor that our society women
are not sure of themselves, that they
lack poise, and are conscious of the
clothes, and that they do not smoke
with grace. "Likewise," says he, "they
handle their cocktails like longshore
men." Aha! The wretch! There are
those of us who wonder who in the
smart set had the honor of his ac
quaintance.
As to the first charge, where are the
women on fhe lists of the Friday- Night
Club or the Assemblyâ and now we
have the Friday Cotillon Club to reck
on withâthat has not a balanced man
ner? To he sure, a poor little debutante
may quake in her tiny shoes, but she's
only a do butane, and that's part of her
business. As to the thrust on the smok
<ng st>ryâlikewise the cocktail allu
sionâthere are those of us w ho believe
that our late KipMngrsque visitor got
his friends in San Francisco somewhat
mixed. It's so easy, don't you know,
to spend a spirited evening with a bevy
of c-lever maids, enjoy the cozy corners,
and a good brew- of punch, and then
wander off into the night when the
punchbowl's lowâand forget to go to
roost. It's a safe guess that our quon
dam guest formed his social estimates
betwixt his departure from the Pacific
avenue home and the dawning of the
new dayâand pot in his hotel.
It is of course true that in all or
ganized bodies, such as society, there
will be a breaking up into cliques, like
clinging unto like; it is therefore true
that those of the maids and matrons
who possess personalityâand who
Sometimes permit it to o'erbalance dis
cretionâmay cross their legs, send
wreaths of smoke a-curling over their
heads and toss off a few cocktails now
and then, but assuredly, not in public
places. And thus do we know that the
cad has dwelt among us! And we vote
that his testimony Irrelevant, incompet
ent and immaterial and that our socie
ty women have poise, are used to good
clothes, and therefore comfortable in
them, and that they don't smoke in
public, nor drink cocktails clumsilyâ
the aspersion of clumsiness is assuredly
libelous. As to the disposition of the
cocktails themselves, that's another
matter.
As to our men, who, by the way,
form an inconspicuous part of our
local smart set, they are a charming lot
of fellows, well-groomed and fairly well
dressed, only they do get the details
of their evening togs pretty badly
mixed. For instance, It's not an un
usual sight o' nights to see a man who
ought to know better with a claw-ham
mer and a black tie, or a Tux with a
white tie. But. with all his faults, the
man of the West's a trump, for he's
usually a manly chap, and cultivated
within him. Taken all In all, our
smart set Is clean In its pleasures, not
given greatly to display, and rather
kindly disposed toward culture and
talent.

Mrs. Kichard Bayne, most gracious
hostess, held an interesting lot of peo
ple at her reception on Wednesday
last. The home on Washington street
was unusually pretty in its scheme of
decoration, diverging from the accus
tomed flowers. In the dining-room was
a great mass of eschscholtzia,
among which, here and there, were
trimmings of English ivy. The effect
was exquisite. The drawing-rooms,
filled with quantities of woodwardia
fern, were further graced in St.

roses. The hostess entertains again
next Wednesday. Receiving with Mrs.

that the British Tibet expedition had
looted the monasteries and libraries of
the forbidden land was strenuously

St. Andrew's Society Plans
Entertainment in Honor
of Hi rt Inlay of the Poet
WILL SLXU HIS LYRICS
l{ev. William Eadcr to De
liver Oration on (renins
of Scotland's Great Bard j
Every loyal Scot In the city will put
aside hi? cares next Wednesday night
and prepare to celebrate in a fitting
manner the one hundred and forty
sixth birthday of the greatest of Scot- ,
land's great poets, Robert Burns. A
busy committee has been working hard
in preparing a fitting programme which
will be rendered at Scottish Hall on
Larkin street under the auspices of the ,
St. Andrew's Society.
The St. Andrew's Society of this city '
has observed the birthday of Burns for
nearly fifty years. The occasion is al- |
ways held sacred by every Scotchman,
but this year the plans are more elab- ,
orate than ever and a celebration that '
promises to eclipse any of the former ,
ones has been arranged.
The programme will include a varied
collection of musical and literary pieces, |
including some of the choicest lyrics
of the immortal Burns. Several lead
ing singers have volunteered their serv
ices. A pleasing feature of the pro- |
gramme will be readings from the
works of Scotland's leading men of â 
letters.
Rev. William Rader. the noted pulpit
speaker, has consented to deliver the
oration. He will speak on "The Genius (
of Burns.'' As usual, the literary and ;
musical programme will be followed by
a grand ball where all present can j
make merry.
The celebration is in charge of an
able committee which will look out for
each detail. The sub-committe in j
charge of the dance, J. Black, W. Car- :
nle and Q. Webster, has worked hard j
to make the affair a social as well as a
great literary success.
ATTORNEY DWYER WANTS
OWN WAY IN Dl NSMVIR CASE
!
Sir Charles H. Tupper Crosses Swords
With Expert. Who Is Testifying j
on Probate Matters.
Sir Charles H. Tupper and Expert j
J. J. Dwyer are still crossing swords !
in the Dunsmuir case, which is go
ing on before Commissioner Courtenay !
Bennett at the British consulate.
Dwyer refuses to answer the interro
gallons of Sir Charles except in a way ;
that suits himself. Sir Charles, chaf- 1
ring at the evasive replies, asked the
witness: "Cannot you answer my ques
tions with either 'yes' or 'no".'"
Dwyer replied: "1 think by this
time. Sir Charles, that you ought to
know and understand that I will only |
answer your questions in a manner
in which I think right and which ex
presses my own ideas on the subject." I
Sir Charles responded: "In our i
i ourte you would be compelled to give
direct answers. lam sure they would
have checked you up at least twenty
times during the evidence you have
been giving here."
Attorney Wheeler remarked that
if this case were being held before a ;
court of this State "Sir Charles would ;
have been himself checked' up."
The question of bringing J. A. S. t
Lowe before the commission was again :
brought up by attorneys for Edna Wal- j
lace Hopper and Mrs. Joan Duns
muir. A. P. Luxton, attorney for â¢
James Dunsmiur, said that he had not
made up his mind whether he would |
produce Lowe or not. Sir Charles in- j
timated that unless he received a sat- i
isfactory answer very soon about Lowe j
being recalled to the stand he would ;
take steps to see that Lowe was or
dered to put in an appearance.
Further hearing of the case will be
resumed to-morrow morning at 10:30
o'clock.

! AUTO 10 FIGHT
i DEADLY GERMS
; Health Board Pleased With
Tests Made of the New
I Sterilizing Contrivance
IS FIKST OF ITS KIND
Apparatus Is the Only Port
j aide Machine for the
Destruction of Bacteria
The only portable sterilizer in the j
United, States had its first official test ;
yesterday at the Dundon Iron Works. I
If the deadly little germs that were put 1
into its capacious sterilizing chamber i
â¢do Yiot show signs of life within five \
days the apparatus will be accepted by
the Board of Health and sent forth to j
wage war on bacteria.
The sterilizer is an automobile affair, 1
up-to-date in every respect. In case, of
an epidemic the apparatus can be
moved from door to door in the stricken j
, district. The disinfecting compartment i
is big enough to hold ail the bedding
of an entire household.
Though the Health Board does not ;
anticipate any outbreak of contagious
| disease, it declares that the sterilizer is
indispensable as a precautionary meas- ;
i ure. It is the intention of the board as ;
Boon as the apparatus is accepted to j
disinfect all shoddy goods manufac
tared in this city and all clothing made
:in Chinatown. Consequently the ma- ',
, chine will never be idle.
The apparatus is a massive thing, |
j weighing four tons. It requires two en
| glneers to operate it in its travels. Its
: maximum speed is five miles an hour, j
The cost to the city will be $4000. Oil is
used as fuel.
Under the direction of Dr. Hassler
and Dr. Kagan of the Board of Health
the sterilizing apparatus had a thor- !
I ough test yesterday morning. Three
I different species of germs were placed
j In a pile of soiled bedding and put into
' the machine. A vacuum was created
lin the disinfecting chamber, which was
' afterward filled with formaline gas. j
I The clothing was left in the compart- |
! ment half an hour. If the germs show >
signs of life after five days the appa- !
i ratus will not be deemed a success. j
One of the species of little life-dc- i
! stroyers operated upon was the deadly
I anthrax germ. This is the hardest of
; all to kill. If the sterilizer stands the
I anthrax test it will kill any of the in
! visible messengers of disease.
When Dr. Hassler produced cards
! containing threads In which the germs
j were clustered there was a scurrying
i among the spectators until the physi
! cian announced that the germs were
I all under his control. The three species
i used in the experiment are diphtheria,
! anthrax and strathylococcl germs,
j The patent on the apparatus is owned
!by P. F. Dundon. proprietor of the
! Dundon Iron Works. It was intended
! to try the machine in climbing some of
the nearby hills yesterday, but the ,
paint on the auto was not thoroughly
I dry.
The Board of Health naturally takes
i great pride In having the most up-to- j
date apparatus of its kind. Though i
: every large city has stationary sterillz-
I ers, San Francisco will be the first to i
have a portable one.

JE. C. Hayes Sues Sisters to Cancel

j during that period his sisters, profess

ibe for his best interests if he would
'â  sell his share in the estates to them j

WTMAN WANTS
A NEW TRIAL
Files a Motion With Judge
Lawlor Giving Seventeen
Reasons for Granting It
i Charles Wyman, convicted of fraudu
lently voting at the last primary elec
tion, appeared for sentence in Judge
Lawlor's court yesterday. When the
i case was called Attorney Countryman
filed a motion for a new trial and an
affidavit by the defendant giving seven
teen reasons why the motion should be
! granted.
Wyman alleges among other things
j that the verdict was contrary to the
law and the evidence; that the court
erred in decisions on questions of law
and by misdirection to the Jury; that
the Jury received evidence outside of
the court and was guilty of miscon
duct: that the special attorneys for the
prosecution and the Judge were guilty
of legal misconduct, and that there
. was newly discovered evidence.
The defendant charges that on Satur
day, January 14, between 11:15 a. m.,
when the District Attorney concluded
his argument, and 2 p. m., when the
Judge delivered his charse to the Jury,
George T. Wright and Jonn A. Hosmer,
attorneys employed by the Merchants'
Association to assist in the prosecution,
did in the Judge's chambers go into
consultation with the Judge as to the
charge and instructions to be given to
the jury, which was done in the ab
sence of the defendant or his counsel
and without either of them being ad
vised or permitted to be present.
Countryman said he desired to put
I Attorney Hosmer on the stand for the
| purpose of examining him as to the al
leged .consultation with the Judge, and
also Police Judge Cabaniss as to al
leged errors at the preliminary hearing.
Judge Lawlor denied the request, say
| ing he could not listen to any testi
mony on a motion for a new trial, and
! Countryman demurred, saying he de
, sired the testimony to enable him to
I prepare a bill of exceptions on appeal,
l The case was continued till January
!25 for argument on the motion for a
I new trial.
Prisoners Are Sentenced.
Fred Durkhard, convicted of rob-
I bery, was sentenced by Judge Dunne
! yesterday to serve five years In San
Quentin. He was one of a triot that
robbed L. Kessler, a marine fireman,
jon April 28. He was allowed to go
on his own *recognizance, sentence be
: lng suspended, but instead of behaving
< himself he' associated with known
! criminals. Joseph William Figg, a
i colored man, who pleaded guilty to
three burglaries on vessels, was sen-
I tenced to four years in San Quentin.
Ernest Carron, for stealing a gold
watch and chain from G. S. Menden
hall on November 23, was sentenced to
seven years in San Quentin.
Gets Alternative Writ.
The Suprenpe Court granted an al
ternative writ of review yesterday in
favor of Harrison Gray Otis of Los
Angeles, who has been fined $500 for
reporting in his newspaper certain
proceedings of the Grand Jury of his
county. The case has been set for
hearing for the morning of Feb
ruary 16.

SUNDAY JAflQAin
THE CALL recently commended the gallantry of Colorado in
so arranging the contest for the Governorship that women who
had part in the election frauds would escape the inconvenient
penalties imposed upon that sprt of transgression. We grieve to
â¢ ' say that some parts of Colorado do not deserve our praise. One
lady who was a judge of election in a small town was actually put
in jail. The Associated Press reports that she finally made a full
â¢ statement of hef falsification of the tally sheet intrusted to her fair
and official hands on election day, and in consideration of this in
formation has been released. Yet, let us admit that there is in
Colorado a general disinclination to visit penalties upon women who
. violate the election laws, or even to expose them.
Since they first had suffrage there offenses have been charged
against them." After the first election at which they voted the wife
of Governor Waite. herself a long-standing advocate of woman suf
frage, charged that they sold their votes. So the ballot that
"Falls as light as snowflake on the sod;
And executes the freeman's will.
As lightning does the will of God."
over in Colorado seems to be getting along about the same now as
when its snowflake act was in the hands of man alone.
Because we commended the gallantry of Colorado in this
matter we are called to account in a communication from the
Susan B. Anthony Club of this city. We have the greatest respect
: for the name of Miss Anthony. She is probably the only advocate
of female suffrage who is on all hands admitted to put it on logical
â¢ anfl tenable grounds. We felicitate the local club that bears her
name, though it girds at us most vigorously. It calls on us to re
tract what we have said about women and the Colorado election
â  frauds, or else rile a bill of particulars. With an eye to the nearest
shelter, we refuse to do either. To refer to the matter at all was
justifiable, as it is a matter of news and of human interest, but to
appear as the accuser of our sister woman in Colorado and file spec
ifications and a ground plan and front elevation of. her peccadilloes
' would be so conspicuously ungallant that the Susan B. Anthony Club
. will please excuse us.
â¢ Our object in referring to the matter was to support Miss An
thony, by showing the futility of the claim that when and where
women vote purity white-winged and feathered like a dove will
â â¢ abide, and roost low without fear, and all vice and folly will go gib
. Bering into limbo. Miss Anthony does not believe that. She seems
â¢ to be of the opinion that women inherit enough old Adam from their
â  fathers to make them look upon things heretofore performed only
.by men about as men do. She wants them to have a hand in the
. game, and does not certify that they will always play it fair. But
. nothing can ever make men treat women as men treat each other,
. nor as often. There are few men who will, as jurors, bring in a
. verdict that will hang a woman. All the country expected to see
â¢ Nan Patterson acquitted, and we think regretted that she was not.
â¢ â¢ We think that if Mrs. Chadwick's case were referred to the male
. vote of the country, outside the bankers she favored with her pa
tronage, she would be acquitted, and fun would be made of her mel
ancholy victims.
â¢. . The ladies of the Susan B. Anthony Club say to us with disquiet
ing emphasis: "The women of Colorado and women everywhere, in
cluding the women of California, ask not for gallantry but for jus
tice." Xo use, ladies, you can't get justice from us. We are moved
toward you by the manly sentiment of gallantry only. We put it
. over your heads like a canopy, and around you like a garment. Noth
ing that you do or leave undone can tempt us to do you justice, for
' justice is not good enough for you, and you are entitled to the best.
We may add, too, that age, that thief that steals bloom and beauty,
â  can make off with the spoils, and not lessen the title and right of
women to the gallantry of man. If there be a male exception to this
he is a deformity that only proves the rule. As far as we are con
cerned the ladies of Colorado can make the ballot-box howl and we
will insist on thinking none the less of them.
SCHOLARSHIPS FOR CHINESE STUDENTS.
UNUSUAL significance attaches to the announcement recently
made by Professor John Fryer of the Department of Oriental
Languages at the State University to the effect that Sheng,
â¢at present the strong man of China, has endowed five scholarships
for Chinese students at Berkeley. For the first time a Chinese official
has given money to the cause of education outside of the domain
of the dragon empire.
The interpretation of this act of Sheng's reveals the rapid
. strides being made by China in the process of finding herself. Not
only has the party of progress survived the incessant persecutions
of old Tsi An and her council of reactionaries, but from behind the
throne itself it is now directing the course of China along the broad
ening paths of Western civilization. Sheng is the head of the rail
way and telegraph administrations in China. The young men whom
he hopes to aid in the university at Berkeley are already selected by
their benefactor to enter the administrative service under him and
to direct the awakening energies of the country along the lines of
scientific development. This astute leader of affairs in China recog
â¢ nizes that only by direct training in the seats of Western culture can
the. men of new China be made competent to lead their country into
successful competition with the nations of the world.
For our own university this act of the Chinese statesman car
ries important presage for the future. Not the university
â a direct influence in China already through Professor Fryer, than
whom no Occidental in the confidence of Chinese councils has greater
power, but this endowment of scholarships will make California the
certain goal of the constantly increasing number of young men seek
ing education in the West. "This act of Sheng's," says Professor
â¢â¢ Fryer, "is merely the thin edge of the wedge, which I hope later will
penetrate into the Chinese life and lead to other gifts by Chinese
for similar purposes and to the introduction of California trained men
into the Chinese empire."
BOMBSHELLS have been dropping into the exclusive ranks of
the British military with startling frequency of late and the
upheavals ensuing have been of more or less seriousness. The
latest missile exploded comes in the form of a comparison between
the English military schools and our own West Point in which the
commentator, Dr. T. Miller Maguire, an acknowdedged authority
upon the subject of military training, draws some conclusions not
calculated to make the British mind more restful.
"Superior to the English military school at Sandhurst in every
things that counts for efficiency" is Dr. Maguire's estimate of West
Point. Not only are the rules of discipline rigidly enforced in the
American school, but the curriculum is of such a nature that no
dawdler or dilettante student can remain in the school for six months.
In contrast with this'the critic finds that the English training school
â¢for the army, what was originally intended as a democratic institu
tion for the preparation of efficient officers, has degenerated to
"practically a preserve for rich men's sons," that cadets "have little
Inducement to work and the instructors little inducement to teach,'*
and that "to get through with as little trouble as possible is the
dominating idea." From this state of affairs the "regrettable inci
dents" in the Boer war followed as an inevitable corollary.
After all the efficiency of a school for military training depends
.in the final instance upon the morale of the men. In West Point,
where no social distinctions exist and all are inspired by the spirit
of earnest endeavor, this element is kept at its highest perfection.
In the English schools, where caste and favoritism inspired by re
gard for caste obtain, nothing but an indifferent product of training

BRITISH MILITARY TRAINING.
â¢ THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY. JANUARY 22, 1905.
REALISM DOES NOT
* MAR ROMANCE *
BY DOROTHY FENIMORE.
%# IK often hear of love at
* * \ V j first sight. So is there not
V/X/ a love not depending on
â¢ â¢ our wills?" asks a reader.
Undoubtedly there Is
such a thing as love at first sight.
Many great men have given testimony
to this effect. Poets have sung about
such a love in words that were them
selves romance. Historians have put
it down in sober black and white as
a deciding factor in the destiny of in
dividuals and, through them, of na
tions.
But how far the matter is independ
ent of will is another question. It
adds to the mystery of the phenome
non if we declare it to be so. But, as
I have already more than hinted, I
am skeptical about fate and Cupid
and Venus of the rosy cloud and all
the rest of those exterior forces
personified which are supposed to
guide mortals in their love affairs.
And it does not seem to me generous
to put unnecessary burdens upon the
back of providence.
Most of the people who fall In love
at first sightâif not all of themâare
just ready to fall in love some way or
other. They have four-leaf clovers in
their shoes, so to speak, and are wait
ing for something matrimonial to turn
up. They are often victims of what
has been called a "mood of Inflam
mable expectancy."
Sometimes thi? is the result of jad
ing too much love literature of the
poems-of-pnssion kind. This Is true
especially in extreme youth. When
the parties concerned are older their
romance usually has an exceedingly
practical basis; either one or both of
them being on the lookout for a life
partner at the time when they, two
people of congenial tastes, fortuitous
ly met.
This realism does not detract at all,
to my mind, from the beauty of the
idea oWÂ»ve at first sight. There is one
thought the latter carries whose spirit
ual force no material associations can
impair. It is that reminiscence of
earlier joys suggested so exquisitely in
the little poem of Rossetti's called
"Sudden Light":
"I have been here before.
But when or how I cannot tell;
I know the grass beyond the door,
The sweet, keen smell,
The sighing sound, the lights around
the shore.
. "You have been mine before â
How long ago, I may not know:
But just when at that swallow's soar
Tour neck turned so,
Some veil did fallâl knew it all of
yore."
Love at first sight is most profitable
as an experience, I should say, either
when it is not reciprocated or when it
can be evolved. As this English critic freely acknowledges, the de
ficiency having its inception in the military school grows and gathers
Strength with the graduated students who obtain commissions in the
army. So great a discrepancy between American and British stan- ,
dards of military training does Dr. Maguire recognize that he trench
antly warns his countrymen that in the case of a clash between
America and Great Britain the latter's armies would be "flattened out
like a pancake."
MR. BOURKE COCKRAN is constituting himself a genius of J
guidance for the whole United States. His most recent or
der to our people relates to our public schools. He denounces
them as agnostic and inimical to the public welfare, winding up with
the remark that nobody that is anybody sends his children to the i
public schools. As our common schools are an American institution,
as much a part of our system as the constitution itself, it is to be re
gretted that they are disfavored by Mr. Cockran, for now, of course,
they will have to go. It is a pity that he did not look this over before
he came to the country, because then he might have stayed away to
avoid the demoralizing contact of this American institution. But it
is too late to speculate on it now. He is here and the country seems
too small for him and the public schools at one time.
By calling them agnostic he probably means" that the schools
are secular. This is true and they must be secular, in the nature of
things. Our population is made up of people of all kinds of reli
gious views. To introduce these into the schools means making them
the battle ground of sectarian strife, which would destroy them as
far as the purposes of the state are concerned. It is the history of
all nations where education is secular that there is progress and re
ligious liberty.
From the most ancient times, where education is an ecclesi
astical concern, religious liberty is unknown. Our constitution guar
antees religious liberty, and in a very important sense our secular
schools are necessary to that guarantee. As there are 20,000,000 of
pupils in our public schools, it is depressing to be told by Mr. Cock
ran, practically, that no gentleman sends his children to them. We 1
I must be a nation of vulgarians, and it is surprising that Mr. Cockran j
I consents lo remain with us.
WHEN the Russian fleet ran amuck through the fishing boats
in the North Sea it was believed to be the most amazing
blunder of which ignorance or cowardice could be guilty.
It came near causing a war with Great Britain and vastly dis
credited the Russian navy. But it was not the worst that Russia
can do. The firing of a salute from loaded guns at the royal
chapel, where the Czar and the whole Romanoff family were pow
wowing the waters of the Neva in pious ceremony, by
the dazzling dignitaries of the state church, is a more amazing
blunder than shooting at a harmless fishing fleet. But little change
in the angle of the shot would have exterminated the whole Roman
off family and changed a dynasty. Russian officialdom is put in
a very embarrassing position by the affair. If the guns were
shotted accidentally it is such colossal stupidity and carelessness
as to show that the officers are unfit to be trusted with handling
gunpowder and shells. If it were a plot to destroy the Czar and
his dynasty it proves the utter unreliability of the army and its
seasoned hatred of the autocracy which the Czar represents. Mili
tary honor will have to ponder seriously which theory to accept.
In its personal aspect the tragedy that came so near would have
been most appalling. The religious pageant in which the Czar was
taking part was a very brilliant affair. Its annual occurrence calls
crowds of visitors to St. Petersburg from all parts of the Continent.
It is a relic of the gorgeous barbarism of the north, made over to
fit the ritual of the church. All of the foreign diplomats were
spectators and the wealth and fashion of the Continental capitals
were in the audience. To be nearly shot down by his own guns
in such a presence is a frightful humiliation to the Czar. It may
yet become necessary for Russia to disarm in order to be safe from
herself.
prefaces a courtship long enough for
the smitten ones to find out whether or
not their first flattering impressions of
each other are weatherproof, and dur
able enough to stand the wear and tear
of constant use. The three, Aye, seven
or ten day wooings, of which we read
such glowing accounts, look to me like
short cuts to the divorce court.
It has been suggested by Â»eople who j
"know their Dante in the original," I
which certainly is about as near as any j
one can hope at this late day to get
to the facts, that if he had known his
Beatrice better he would have loved
her less.
Yet, listen to what this poetic lover
had to say about his first meeting with
the little girl, then 9 years old, who was
to guide his genius as a beatific vision:
"At that moment, I tell you truly
that the spirit of life which dwells in
the most secret chambers of the heart
began to tremble so violently that the
least pulses of my body shook there
with, and in trembling it said these
words:
" 'Here is a deity stronger than I,
who, coming, shall rule over me!' "
With the echo in our ears of this con- j
viction of genius, expressed in such '
perfect sincerity, we common folk
would not dare to say there is noth
ing in love at first sight.

LJ AYE something to spare,
' As you go on your way,
If only a smile,
It is needed to-day.
For many you meet

If it's only a smile.
Have something to spare,
As j oa travel along,
If only a word
Or a cheer-giving song.
For many are bent
'Neath a burden of care,
And many are close
To the vale of despair.

A message of hope,

FEARED WESTINGHOUSE.
George Westinghou.se, the famous in
ventor of the air-brake, has a remark
able power over men, according to The
! odore Nevin, who writes of him in the
January World's Work. An incident
demonstrating this occurred in the
president's office in one of the largest
Pittsburg banks a few years ago. The
president's private telephone rang sev
eral times, and finally answering it,
the president said, "Mr. Smith is not in
now."
A visitor, hearing the remark, looked
astonished and asked, "Mr. Smith, why
did you tell him that you were not In?"
Mr. Smith answered: "That was
Mr. Westlnghouse at the other end of
the line. He is a peculiar man and has
a marvelous influence over other men.
It Is impossible to refuse him when he
asks for anything. He wants me to
come to see him, and if I should go and
he should ask me for a large sum of
money I would let him have it. And
we are not now in a position to make
the loan."

IF It had been anything else I
wouldn't have cared," sobbed Ethel,
burying her face deeper Into the
cushions.
A tap at her studio door brought
her to a sitting posture, and. wiping
her eyes with a bit of lace-edged linen,
she called to the visitor to enter.
"Beg pardonâoh, Miss Benton," be
-1 gan the big, motherly looking woman,
"did you send for me?"
| She was the janitor's wife and lived
in the basement of the studio build
ing. Ethel sniffed and continued to dry
her eyes.
"Yes," she said; "some one has stolen
my nice m-muff." And she burst into
' a fresh flood of tears.
"Thereâthere, now," comforted the
woman, patting Ethel's heaving shoul- j
ders. "Dry your pretty eyes and tell j
' me about It."
"There's nothing to tell except that j
it's stolen. Iâl just went out this
j morning for a walk and when I came I
back It was gone."
j "It was here when I cleared up the
room this morning," said the woman, j
! "It was big and brown and long-haired,
wasn't it?"
! Ethel nodded.
"Have you looked everywhere for

Ethel nodded again. "Yes, every

responsible.
"I have the only keys except your
own, and "
"Oh, Mrs. Carter," Interrupted Ethel
hastily, "don't for an instant think
that I blame you! I only sent for you
bo you might investigate in a quiet
way."
"There's only one new tenant in the
buildingâa man on the next floor, but
he seems like a gentleman. I've not
had much talk with him, but I mind his
dog for him sometimes when he's out."
"I don't believe anyone in the build
ing would take it, but âwell, it Is gone.
It was-not the value of the muff, but"
âEthel hesitated and a deeper color
flooded her face â"It was all I had left
that aâa very dear friend gave me."
Even dense Mrs. Carter noticed the
emphasis on the adjective, and the
slight hesitation as to the fitness of the
word "friend."
"I'll keep my eyes open, Miss Ben
ton, and in the meantime don't spoil
your eyes crying."
"All right," replied Ethel, faintly, as
the door closed on the janitor's wife.
But she did cry! How vividly she re
called the day Bert Cameron had given
her the muff. Hawkins, his old chum,

Cameron opened the door of his room
with little enthusiasm. He did not
fancy this place much more than many
other abodes he had taken up in the
last year. He was sorry he had left
the home town, after all, for there, at
least, he had a home. And yet he could
not bear the place after she had gone.
"Hello, Fellow," he said to the frisky
fox terrier who had gone into ecstacies
of delight on hearing his master's key
in the lock.
"What's?"âCameron picked up a
brown muff from the sofa. He put his
hands into it and his face paled. So
she had returned even that one last re
membrance of him! He had cherished
the thought that perhaps she would
think of him when she used the muff.
Inasmuch as she had kept it. But nowâ
A flash of astonishment crossed his
face. Where was she? That she was
in the great city he had known when
he came, but where? He felt within
the muff's soft lining for a note, a word,
a clue of some sort, but there was no
sign. Then he closed his eyes In the
depths of the shaggy brown fur. He
felt sentimental âa bit foolish when he
did it, but who save Fellow would see
him?
"Miss Benton," began Mre. Carter,
entering Ethel's studio. Just as that
young woman, trim In her brown walk
ing suit, was leaving for a lesson, Tts
found your muff."
"What!" cried Ethel.
"I was cleaning that new young
man's room and there, on the couch
was your muff, starln' me in the face.
I âl wouldn't have believed my own
eyes. He's such a nice young man."
"Where is it? What's his name?"
cried the girl in one breath.
"Mr. Cameronâ" Mrs. Carter stopped
short. Ethel had grabbed the door
knob, and her cheek had lost Its pretty
plnkness.
"Cameron?" she echoed.
"Yes; he's on the floor above." Mrs.
Carter stared in blank astonishment.
"And heâhe has the muff?" Ethel
asked, as if unable to believe It.
"Yes, he has it all right."
"Very well, MrÃ. Carter," Ethel said,
after a moment. "I will come and see
you.about it later."
The woman closed the door and de
parted.
"There's something mysterious about
it all," she muttered to herself as she
descended the stairs.
When she was half way down she
turned back, but this time she contin
ued to the floor above.
Opening the door of Cameron's
room, she held up her hands in hor
ror at the sight that met her gaze.
There, on the floor, playing like a child
with a rubber ball, was Fellow and the
muff.
"Ah-h, bad dog." she cried, but be
fore she could catch him he had
dashed past her into the hall, muff in
mouth.
Ethel, coming through the hall, en
countered him.
"Oh, Fellow, Fellow!" she cried, be
tween laughter and tears of Joy. "You
took It!" And she caught the muff,
wet and ruffled from the dog's teeth.
She was burying her face in it when
a man rounded the curve of the stairs
below.
"Ethel!"
"Oh!" was all that young woman
said, while the man took her hands,
muff and all. and the dog howled for
his plaything.
â¢â¢I âI thought It was stolen," said
Ethel, after a time, when Cameron
had seated himself on her couch, and
Fellow was snooping about the room
In a fashion which would Indicate that
he had been there before. In fact, he
had often visited the rooms with Mrs.
Carter when she cleaned.
"And I thought you had returned
it to me because youâyou hated me
and didn't want even a remembrance
of me about." The man held her hand
more closely.
"Oh, Bert, and Iâon, I dont know
anything but that I adore Fellow for
stealing It," she cried Impulsively.
"And âdon't you adoreâdon't yon
love Fellow's master Just a little for
âwell, for possessing such an intelli
gent animal?"
"Perhaps!" Ethel blushed prettily
for the seventh time since the recov
ery of the muff.
"And will you be part owner of such
a wise dog, dear?"
"Yes."

THE world's noblest institution is
the home. It has had a more far
reaching influence than school, or
church, or state. You may dis
member the state, disorganize the
church and disband the school to-day; but
let the h<9me abide, and to-morrow you
may re-establish the school, reorganize the
"church ana reconstruct the state, and be
gin anew the perpetuation of the power
and blessing signified by these agencies.
.â¢ The home is divinely set, more than any
â¢other institution, as the foundation of all
that may be meant by the "Social Organ
. ism,*' and the very stability and perpetuity
;df society and government are guaranteed
â¢through it.
The home is not only the first but it is
the best school the child ever enters, and
.though he may wander far o'er the world's
winding ways he will never forget the

nawthin' wrong. An' I made a mistake
about thim. Far fr'm bein' a hard, cynical'
class, th' bankers iv America is a lot iv jolly
dogs that believes in human nature, takes
life as it is, aisy come, aisy go, hurrah, boys,
we'll be a long time dead. Hard to borrow
money fr'm thim? On th' conthry it's hard
to keep thim fr'm crowdin' it on ye. They'll
lend ye money on annything ye shove in,
on a dhream that ye saw a sojer on horse
back, on th' sad story iv ye'er life or on
yc'er wurrud iv honor if ye're ready to go
back on it. I niver knew what collateral
was until this lady fr'm Cleveland come

bankers lend money. If ye broke into a
bank in Ohio tomorrah ye'd prob'ly find th' â¢
vaults full iv Louisiana lotthry tickets, bets
on th' races an' rayports iv crystal gazing.
"Bankin' is a sthrange business, annyhow.
I make up me mind that I need more money
than I have, or I want to build a railroad
in Omaha or a gas house in Milwaukee, or
Mrs. Chadwick wants an autymobill, or
something else happens an' I start a bank. I
build a brick house, put ir'n gratings on th'
window and ye an' Donohue fight each

gr-reat favor to ye. Says I: 'Hinnissy an'

says I, 'but don't both come at wanst,'
says I, 'for nayther iv yell get it,' says I.
Well, ye lave ye'er money with me an' I
suppose ye think iv it lyin' safe an' sound
in th' big sthrong box where th' burglar

because ye feel that ye'er money is where
no wan can reach it except over me dead

ye'er back befure I've chased those hard
earned dollars off th' premises. With ye'er

and where the first lessons with life-long
influence are taught in the great matters of
morals, aesthetics, social laws, politics, pa
triotism and religion. Here also the holy
ministry of mercy finds its first and fairest
field. To practice the principle Pope has
expressed, "That mercy I to others show
that mercy show to me," we first learn how
at home, where forgiveness and forbearance
are taught as requisites for peace and as
principles of right. The tiny bruised finger
held up to be kissed is not only healed by
mother's lips, but a sobbing heart is soothed
and the great lesson of compassionate ten
derness is taught. Here also standards are
first set, ideals first formed and ambitions
first fired. To tenderly bear and to gra
ciously forbear, to manfully strive and to
worthily endure, to be meek and yet cour
ageous, to require justice and to be mag
nanimous, are principles of the highest or
der when wrought out in the experiences in
cident to the regular order of life, with its
associations and its interdependencies. But
it is the home life that first instills them.
From the helplessness of infancy to the
frailty of age the home stands as one of the
greatest and best forces that touches human
life and makes for all that is good and
noble in man. And when time's winter
frosts have fringed man's brow in white
ness and the earthly end cannot be far
away, where would he wish to "husband out
life's taper at the close" save at his cher
ished hearthstone with all Jhe recollec
tions of his well spent life rich with the
hues and perfumes of love and labor gilding
his passage to the narrow house and il
luminating his path to the skies?

The stately homes of England,
How beautiful they stand!
Amidst their tall ancestral trees,
O'er all the pleasant land,
But the simplicity of the peasant's home,
with its whitewashed walls, its roof of
thatch, its lattice-laden vines where rose
and woodbine clusteringly commune, at
tracts and charms the traveler seeing the
country as it is perhaps more than the "state
ly homes" with their "ancestral trees." But
simplicity of charm without yields to the
grace and virtues of parents and children
within, and while these abide the world's
geography may change, but England's
strength will remain. On our own Atlantic

of influence formative of national charac
ter. As the wilderness was broken and the
primeval forest was penetrated the primary
object was to establish homes in the clear
ings made. Truly the charm and strength,
the potency and power of perpetuation of
worthy principle, and the essential value of
the nation, is in the people, and the home
is one of the greatest and best of all agen
cies making the people in the strength of
noble character.
This institution of the home has now be
come such an integral part of our Christian
civilization that some may question the
possibility of any power uprooting it. But
it must be remembered that everything that
is good has to contend with antagonistic
evil, and that downward and backward to
barbarism is neither hard nor far, and that
the past furnishes examples of great de
clension. Therefore if there be such peril
ous possibility, and if it "concerns the
country that each home be a world pro
found, respected, communicating to its
members an ineffaceable moral imprint,"
then it becomes the duty of all guardians of
the home to strike at every peril and to
strengthen every pillar which in one case
threatens its existence and in the other up
holds its domestic .unity, integrity and sanc
tity. Not to do this is to be self-registered
as an enemy to private and to public good.
Times may~ change, customs may vary,
requirements may differ as decades are
formed and agencies are multiplied, yet the
fundamentals of the home, involving mar
riage, monogamous and voluntary, with its
authority, and reciprocity, and
including fellowship pure, and companion
ship holy, from which comes posterity,
must be held sacred through all times, or
one by one its pillars will fall until this
noble temple fair lies in ruins while man
mourns and angels weep.
Let us then enumerate some perils and
indicate some pillars. It must be manifest
that interference with the elements consti
tuting the home and infringements upon
its rightful time, order, secrecy, sanctity,
pleasure and progress are perils to itâperils
more virtually so than diseases noxious,
contagious, infectious, virulent.
William George Jordan says that hurry is
the American scourge. He affirms that
"nature is very un-American," because "na
ture never hurries." The high pressure of
modern business life is such that "business

says he. 'I've jus' dhropped in an' bor

I. 'On a good thing this afthernoon at
'the man that pays the bills.'" (Ibid). This
high pressure policy is against the welfare
of the family life in the home, and hence
a peril.
Rooms in apartment houses with meals
taken at restaurants do not build up home
life and must be considered a peril.
Saloons are ever the enemy of all that
is good. With their "family entrances" and
open for the child with beer bucket
to be filled, for the young man taking his
first departure from home teachings and
traditions, and for the husband and father
whose money (little or much of it) finds
the way to the saloon till instead of for
the benefit of his home and family, is the
greatest peril threatening the home; and
weak is the voice raised against this enemy.
I will mention but one more perilâdi
vorce. Marriage is monogamous. Divorce
CHOOSING WALL PAPER FOR NERVES
OH. the delights pf moving and
the still greater joy of finding
that your new wall paper is all
wrong and won't go in with
any of your hangings, curtains,
furniture, clothes and complexion.
Then the racking problem of selecting
just the right color to* cover your walls
with. After all is over, your house once
more set to rights, new paper on the wall,
new rugs on the floor, enter your friend
who dabbles in what she says is the science
of color and who politely tells you that
your newly selected wall paper is entirely
wrong in shade and does not harmonize
with your personality and will not prove
beneficial to you in the long run, says a
writer in the New York World.
Of course the coloring on our walls af
fects us to a certain degree, and we are all
conscious of it, but we seldom take it se
riously if the color is a pretty one and the
design on the paper not too obstreperous.
Only the most sensitive mortals have ever
noticed the baneful or good effects of cer
tain tints on themselves and on their friends
and have made a study of colors applied to
the hp me walls.
It goes without saying that the most rest
ful wall paper is of one tint without any
pattern.

"Nobody is too smart to be bunkoed. Th'

is "progressive polygamy.'" Out of mar
riage comes parentage. Children have pre
scriptive claims, and are the inheritors in
their birth to rights of parental protection
that cannot be transferred and from which
tljere is release only in death. Divorce, so
capriciously sought and so readily granted
to-day, infringes on these rights, which
ought to be to all parents as sacred as life
itself.
The home should be a place of cherished
memory. But how shall children find in
recollections of parental separations and
divorces "intangible, indivisible and inalien
able capital" out of which to construct
worthy character in themselves and to es
tablish ennobling homes that add to the
permanent value of the national life? It is
not to be expected. Dynamite ignites
bling a jumping-jack design.
Nervous people can also dispense with
all decorations and confine themselves to a
paper of uniform coloring.
Red is more irritating to the nerves than
any othef color. It is, however, excellent
for people who lack courage or confidence
in themselves. +
Dirty browns and drabs are exceedingly
depressing to a sensitive spirit, while a
good, clear, rich brown will be found
quieting and soothing to the much harassed
man or woman.
Sage green, not too dark, is said to be
excellent for nervous people.
A very depressed person will find in a
room papered in a clear but not too vivid
yellow exhilaration and self-confidence.
Too much white in a light room over
steps the bounds of cheerfuness and gives
a glaring and comfortless look.
Sickly people will respond to pink, which

Space allows but a word to indicate some
pillars sustaining the home. First of all
is its divine constitution. The church of
Christ, that holds up its purity and pleads
for its unity, is a strong pillar. The Bible,
that shows the divine law, and the Sabbath,
that affords spiritual privileges, are pillars
also. The literature that advocates its value
and contends for its sacredness, together
with every example of its simplicity, love
and unity, where "dear relations mingle into
bliss," are pillars of that institution for
which we pray: "God bless our homes."
In papering your rooms don't forget that
what we all need and see is more light.
A light , wall paper need not be an aniline
colored affair that glares at you from every
point of the wall, but a paper that casts a
soft reflection and helps to show off both
objects and people in the most satisfactory
light.
No matter how small the room or how
unattractive it seems at first, when papered
in a harmonious or exhilarating color :t
will be transformed into a cheerful little
nest; but the most palatial chamber draped
in brocade of the wrong hue will finally
get on one's sensibilities. For this reason
hotel rooms are seldom restful, for the
prevalent gilt and crimson are exciting, par
ticularly when brilliantly lighted.

EPPINGERS AND DEMING
APPEAR FOR ARRAIGNMENT
Owing to Absence of Special Counsel
for the Prosecution a Con
tinuance Is Granted.
Herman Eppinger, Jacob Epplnger,
Josua Eppinger and James Deming
appeared In Judge Lawlor's court yes
terday for arraignment on an indict
ment charging them with obtaining
money by false pretenses. Herman
and Jacob were represented by Attor
neys D. J. Murphy and James H.
Budd; Josua by Attorney Edgar D.
Peixotto, and Deming by Attorney
John A. Hosmer.
As there are two indictments, the
arraignment on the second being set
for to-morrow, it was suggested that
a continuance be made so that the de
fendants could be arraigned on both
at the same time. The District Attor
ney said it would take over an hour
to read each of the Indictments.
"I have no objections," said Budd,
"but I don't like to be called out of bed
almost every morning to look after
bonds because a new indictment has
b*.-en found by the Grand Jury. Two
of the defendants are out on $35,000
bonds and one on $20,000, and I would
suggest that If there are to be any
more indictments the bonds should be
made as low as possible."
As Attorney J. C. Campbell, special
counsel for the prosecution, is out of
the city, it was decided to continue
the cases for arraignment of the de
fendants till February 4, in the ex
pectation that Campbell might then be
present.
Suicide of T. A. Griffin.
T. A. Griffin, formerly of the Rid
ley House, Oakland, was' found dead
In his room yesterday morning In the
International Hotel. Gas was escap
ing from an open burner. Griffin was
about 52 years old and was a member
of Aerie No. 7. Eagles, of Oakland.
No writing was found throwing light
on the reasons for the suicide. Fred
M. Griffin, a son, informed the Cor
oner that his father had conducted a
saloon and hotel in the Ridley House
in Oakland, where he lost all his
money.
To Test Street Lines.
The attorney of the Cornell estate
notified City Engineer Woodward yes
terday that he had advised his client
to erect the building on the east side
of Sansome street between Merchant
and Clay according to the lines re
turned by private survey. This would
result in the building encroaching
eighteen inches on Clay street The
building operations will be stopped by
the Beard of Works and a suit will
be brought to determine the legal
lines of the streets.

The members of the National Ouard
of California are walling to hmu fium
Sacramento what the Committee on
Military Affairs In each hou*Â« will rec
ommend In view of the favorable utate
ment relative to the guard madÂ«" by
Governor Pardee in his message. The
report of the special committee on re
vision of the laws governing the guard
will be presented. It Is said that this
proposes a number of radical changes,
and that should these be adopted there
will be a concentration of power so I
that the entire guard will be directly !
under one general head, instead of be- I
ing under different commanders, as is
now the case with the three-brigade
system.
Major Wilhelm, U. S. A., retired, who !
has been detailed by the War Depart- j
ment to inspect the guard of this State, j
is also inspector general on the staff of j
the commander in chief of the National
Guard, with the rank of colonel. He has
been detailed on behalf of the State to j
make a report to the State authorities.
In the past some one else than the
United States inspector was selected to

FAIL TO AGREE
: UPON VERDICT
Jurors in Sorenson Bribery
Case Growing Out of the
Land Frauds Are Dismissed
PORTLAND, Jan. 21.âThe jurors
Bitting in the case of George Soren
son, tried for attempting to bribe for
mer United States District Attorney
. John H. Hall in an effort to have him
hush the land fraud cases in this State
reported to Judge Bellinger to-day
that it was Impossible for them to
â¢ agree upon a verdict. In discharging
the jury Judge Bellinger called the at
tention of Francis J. Heney, who is
prosecuting the land fraud cases for
the Government, tÂ«o the failure of the
jury to agree on a verdict in the face
of evidence which Judge Bellingci said
warranted but one verdict âthat of
conviction. The court urged Heney to
summon the members of the jury be
fore the Federal Grand Jury, that a
â¢ thorough investigation of the matter
might be made.
It is reported that two of the jurors
are friends of the defendant, Soren-
Bon.
Dispatches from Washington have
been published here to the effect that
Senator Mitchell will return to Port
land to insist upon an early trial, Infor
mation having reached him that the
â¢ .prosecution is in no hurry to bring him
to trial and that an official very closely
connected with the prosecution of the
land fraud cases has advised friends in
this city that Senator Mitchell will not
. be brought to trial for at least a year.
Attorney Heney, who Is prosecuting
the cases for the Government, when
. shown the Washington dispatch to-day,
' said:
"If any person made such a state
ment It is utterly without foundation.
The prosecution refrained from causing
the arrest of either Senator Mitchell or
Congressman Herrmann because both
.. of them expressed anxiety to reach
Washington to attend to public busi
ness.
"As prosecuting officer I concluded
to await the adjournment of Congress
before pressing their case for trial. I
'am ready and more than willing to
give each of these gentleman a speedy
trial, and the prosecution will urge
the trial of their cases at the earliest
day the court can take them up in the
â¢ next term commencing April 10, 1905,
.and no postponement whatever will be
' asked for by the Government."
â  The Federal Grand Jury to-day re
. turned an additional indictment
against Sorenson, charging him with
perjury in connection with the ac
knowledgment of the relinquishment of
. the George A. Howe homestead, one
of the tracts in the "11-7" district.

It Is Believed That Bandits Intended

PORTLAND, Or.. Jan. 21âWhat is
supposed to have been a plan to hold
up the Oregon Railroad and Navigation
Company's eastbound train No. 4,
known as the Spokane flyer, was partly
accomplished this evening just after
the train left the Bast Portland station.
Four masked men boarded the rear
platform of the last car at the East
Side depot. The track enters a dark
ravine a few hundred feet south of the
depot. As the train turned into the
gulch the four men entered the smok
ing compartment and commanded the
occupants to throw up their hands. The
thieves proceeded to go through their
victims, from whom they secured about
$100 and a gold watch.
When these few passengers had been
robbed the bandits' nerve seemed to
have failed them, for they stopped the
train and jumped off, disappearing in
the heavy undergrowth along the sides
of the gulch.
Word was sent to the city and county
authorities, who went at once to the
bridge and quickly organized a posse,
which started in search of the thieves.

CHALLENGES
CHURCHILL
TO A DUEL
Â»
Edward Clarkson Fa
vors His Fists as
Weapons.
Special Cable to The Call and New York
Herald. Copyright, 1006, by the New York
Herald Publishing Company.
LONDON, Jan. 21. âMuch interest
is taken in London in the story of a
challenge to a pugilistic or wrestling
duel, addressed to Winston Churchill
by Edward Clarkson of Preston.
Churchill has not taken any notice of
Clarkson's letter. Indeed, the latter
could hardly have hoped for any cog
nizance to be taken of his truculent
epistle, for Clarkson not merely de
viated from the principles of duello in
regard to what may be termed choice
of weapons, but he neglected the ini
tial formalities.
Clarkson wrote, after making a de
mand for an apology for Churchill' 3
remarks regarding the aged Member
of Parliament for Preston, that if an
apology were not forthcoming he
(Clarkson) would be under the "pain
ful necessity of requesting Churchill
to fix time and place where they could
settle the matter in true Lancashire
fashion by Queensberry rules. Clark
son's letter concluded by saying that
if he failed to give Churchill the best
drubbing the latter ever had he would
feel asnamed of the name of Clark
son.
Churchill was described a few days
ago as the best-hated man in English
politics, which is assuredly a distinc
tion that does not often accrue to a
man of his years. On the other hand,
Churchill received no longer ago than
Thursday night last a tribute such as
might' have turned an older head. He
was chief guest at a banquet of the
National Liberal Club, which is rare
in the annals of that institution. Men
who have grown old and done yeoman
service in the cause of British Liber
alism gathered to do him honor and
for more than an hour listened with
rapt attention to a speech which, even
Churchill's enemies admitted, was
equal to his best and most brilliant
oratorical efforts.

IN A THEATER'S
PROPERTY ROOM
Chorus Singer in Madame
Nordica's Company Quits
Life's Battle,
Special Dispatch to Th* Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. 21.âGay throngs
were passing into the Metropolitan
Opera-house this afternoon to witness
the production of "La Giaconda" and
singers and chorus were making ready
for the curtain's rise when a real trag
edy was enacted behind the scenes. De
spondent over news that his aged
father and mother, in Germany, were
ill and probably dying, Fritz Tasch,
one of the leading chorus singers, went
to the property room on the third floor
and hanged himself.
During the last three days the man
agement of the opera-house had been
aware of Tasch's mental condition and
had made many efforts to cheer him
VP. He told of having received letters
from his old home at Cologne, Ger
many, which said that his father and
mother were near death. He said that
he was their supporter; that he had not
seen them in many years and that he
wished to resign his position to go to
them.
Before any of the other singers were
about to-day he appeared at the opera
house, where he was handed three let
ters, two of which had been received
by the last steamship from Europe. He
retired and was not seen again until
his inanimate body was found by
Charles Link and Caesar Casamast tn
the property room.
Mme. Nordics, who sang the leading
role, expressed great regret at the sing
er's death, while in the chorus the
greatest of gloom prevailed.

OF CHICKEN
lowa Girl Recovers a Valu

Months Ago.
Special Dispatch to Tne OaJl.
DUBUQUE. lowa, Jan. 21.â1t was
fortunate for Miss Mamie Gaulson of
Fort Dodge that she had chicken for
dinner to-day, for she recovered pos
session of a much prized necklace, set
with precious stones, that she lost two
years ago. The chain was found
stowed away in the gizzard of the
fowl, where It evidently had been for
months, as It is quite worn in some
places.
Miss Gaulson's family recently
moved to town from a farm south of
Gowrie. While picking flowers the
young woman lost her necklace. When
the family moved to town they sold
all but a few of their fowls and these
they killed, dressed, froze and packed
In a barrel.
When the gizzard of the last, a fat
old hen, was opened, the inner lining
was cut into and a lustrous speck was
observed. Much to the surprise and
delight of the young woman, her pre
cious necklace fell upon the table.

Labor Leaders
Ignore Emper
or's Warning.
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 22, 1:05 a.
m.âDespite the assurances at mid
night that the situation was well in
hand and that ample steps had been
taken to protect the vast industrial sec
tion of St. Petersburg and insure the
safety of the city, the greatest uneasi
ness pervades the entire population.
Picked troops are stationed at vari
ous points in the city, and each house
contains a miniature garrison, with
gendarmes in the courtyards and ma
chine guns read for the first emer
gency.
The Winter Palace is strongly picket
ed, with Grand Duke Vladimir in com
mand. Final Instructions were issued
to-night.
The plan of the Government is to
prevent the workmen coming to the
center of the city to-day, by guarding
gates and bridges. A collision, there
fore, is believed to be more likely to
occur in the outskirts of St. Petersburg.
Meantime the strikers are carrying
out their original programme, The few
mills and factories remaining active in
the city were closed during the day,
one of the last of them being the Gov
ernment powder mill. Strike leaders
visited every shop in the city, and all
of thc-m, even those of thajautchers and
bakers and laundries, were closed.
Traffic was stopped on the street car
lines, the carmen having Joined the
strikers.
LEADERS IGNORE WARNING.
Preparations for the big demonstra
tion at the Winter Palace square at 2
o'clock to-day have not been suspend
ed, although the leaders have been
warmd that it cannot take place and
that the Emperor will not be there. The
workmen are all convinced that Nich
olas will appear and listen to the griev
ances set forth in the petition.
The deputation which on Friday took
the invitation to Emperor Nicholas to
attend the meeting has failed to gain
access to his Majesty. Father Gopon
to-day sent it by his secretary to Inte
rior Minister Svlatopolk-Mirsky.
During the day Antonius, Metropol
itan of St. Petersburg, formally ex
communicated Father Gopon on the
ground that he was causing the people
to rise against the Emperor, the head
of the church.
Rumors that the troops have plainly
Indicated their sympathy with the
strikers and that if it came to a col
lision they would refuse to fire upon
them are rife, and the workmen them
selves are thorouhly convinced that
such Is the case; but the authorities
maintain that the loyalty of the troops
is beyond question, pointing out that
the only time Russian regiments show
ed treachery was in the revolution of
18 ,, l They say that the troops then
were practically soldiers of fortune,

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 22, 1905.
ALL EUROPE RENT
BY POLITICAL AND
SOCIAL OUTBREAKS
Peace of Continent Is Threatened
German Coal Strike May Extend
Across Belgian Frontier.
. Â«
Special Dispatch to The Call.
j LONDON, Jan. 21.âThis week closes
; with political and social conditions in
Europe more disturbed than at any pre
! vious period since the Franco-Prussian
! war. Russia is battling with an in
cipient revolution; Germany is in
volved in a coal strike, which threat
ens to extend across the Belgian
frontier and cause an enormous in
j dustrial and economic loss. In both
Russia and Germany these disturb
! anees are partly industrial and partly
j political.
In Russia the people are assailing
! disastrous labor conditions, which, they
1 are convinced, can never improve un
| til both autocracy and bureaucracy are
! abolished. The Russian strike has as-
I sumed the essential character of a
j revolution, although the revolution thus
j far has not been marked by general
1 carnage.
In Germany the strikers are casting
I about for political support. They recog

; tionary ideas of France. It is more
i fully realized, however, that if j the
trÂ«>ops mutiny or actually join the
workmen the Government will be con
. fronted not with riot, but with revolu
j tion.
GOPOX WILL NOT YIELD.
Father Gopon, at the request of Min
ister of Justice Muravieff, went to the
; Ministry of Justice yesterday and had
! a long interview with Muravieff, when
; the Minister tried to dissuade him from
i his programme for to-day. Father
Gopon, however, could not be budged,
ami at the end of the interview left,
j saying:
â¢â¢We must each do our duty accord- |
ing to the light given us."
The plan of the workmen is to as- '
semble at three pointsâthe Poutiloff
una Oubokoff works and the island of j
Vassili Ostrovaâand march to the Pal- I
ace square. They are fully convinced
that the Emperor will be there to re
ceive their petition.
! A representative of the press went
among many groups of workmen and
; found no one who expressed doubt as
v. tN Emperor mooting them. All spoke
of him mHt^+tr*nÂ« f "* knd they mi
i sisted that he was kept in ignorance
sof the truth, and that once he had
heard of their grievances they would
receive justice. They said that just
what was wanted was shorter hours,
more pay and more liberty; but the
ideas of most of the men op the latter
point are rudimentary. They declared
their peaceful intentions and said they
did not want to fight. They seemed
to entertain little fear of being shot
down. , ~
â¢ The soldiers are on our side, said
one of the leaders. "They may Are on
j the palace, but not on us." '
While not one of the workmen raised
a voice against the Emporor, they did
I not spare some of the imperial family,
i especially Grand Duke Alexis, who,
--! with others, they charged .with being
responsible for Russia's defeat in the
war in the Far East, saying that they
kept the Emperor in ignorance of the
I true situation. Some of them repeated
current gossip about Grand Duke
! Alexis and the Russian fleet.
! "We know what happened In a thea
ter some time ago, when his mistress
; came on the stage covered with jew
els," said one of the men. "The gal
lories hissed her and the people cried:
'Take them off; they are not diamonds,
but drops of Russian blood.' "
' Late to-night it was reported a strike
has been declared in the paper mills in
i Finland, and rumors are that if Dlood
is shed here to-day there will be many
| serious risings throughout the land.
The rumors, however, probably belong
to the crop of sensational stories with
which the city is filled.
Father Gopon sent a letter to Minis
ter of the Interior Prince Sviatopolk
| Mirsky to-day, begging that Emperor
Nicholas appear at the Winter Palace
jon Sunday. The text of the letter fol
i lows:
I "Your Excellency: Workmen of all
! classes in St. Petersburg wish to sea
| the Emperor at 2 o'clock p. m., January
, 22, in the square at the Winter Palace,
iin order to personally express to him
' the needs of all the Russian people. I
am assured by all workmen, my co
laborers and comrades, and even by al-
I leged revolutionaries, that his Majesty
has nothing to fear. His personal safe
ty is assured. Let him come as the
; true Emperor, with courage in his
heart, to his people to receive the petl-
I tlon from our hands. Otherwise the
moral bond hitherto existing between
! the Emperor and the people may be
broken.
"It is your Excellency's high duty to
the Emperor and to the entire people pt
; Russia to communicate the foregoing
Ito his Majesty the Emperor to-day,
! without delay, and also the contents of
our petition f ttaehed hereto. Say to
the Emperor that I, together with
many workmen and thousands of peo
ple of Russia, am Irrevocably resolved,
j with my faith in him, to proceed to the
I Winter Palace In order that he may
I show his fnlth by deeds and not b,y
' manifestos."
The document is signed by Father
j Gopon and eleven representatives of
sections of the workmen's union.

KUROPATKIN REINFORCED.
Russian Army on the Shakhe Numbers
300.000 Men.
TO|CIO, Jan. 21.âGeneral Kuropat
kin's army along the Shakhe River
has been reinforced by four divisions,
according to information reaching'
usually well Informed quarters here,
and it is estimated that the present
strength of the forces facing Field
Marshal Oyama total nine army corps,
approximating 300,000 men of all
arms. General Kuropatkin's head
quarters in the field are in close touch
with the Mukden-Pushan Railway
line.
Of late the Russians have been
, heavily strengthening their wings. At
the present time two and a half divi
sions are facing General Oku's left
army and two army corps face Gen
eral Nodzu's center army, while the
greater strength of three army corps

FEW DISTURBANCES.
Reports From Several Districts Show
That Peace Prevails.
HERNK, Prussia. Jan. L'l.âEvery
thing is quiet here. The roal output
it scarcely sufficient for the miners' own
demands. The pojice have ordered the
early closing of the saloons on payday.
Townsmen are contributing liberally
to support the strike. In the Castrop
district several workmen have been
maltreated, but no rioting occurred.
In the Rausel district a trainload
of miners at the Victor mine were at
tacked and shots were exchanged.
Y'eeterday a tree was laid across the
railroad tracks and to-day there were
indications of rioting. The gendar
merie arrested eight men and also a
woman.
DORTMUND, Jan. 21.âAbout 18 per
rent of the coal operatives are striking
and the mines are producing very lit
tle coal. Excellent order prevails.
RUETTERSCHEII.D, Prussia. Jan.
21.âThe strike here is general. There
have been no disturbances. Owners of
several mines have Informed the strik
ers that the pits will be closed forever
if the strike continues.

Bank Statement Showing an
Unexpected Expansion Is
Cause of Some Confusion
NEW YORK. Jan. 21.âThere was
a good deal of commotion and some
confusion in the active two hours*
trading of to-day's stock market, but
the important changes of the day
were confined to a few stocks. The
further buoyant rise in the Northwest
ern grangers was in connection with
another rise in the Northern Securities
stocks on the curb. The general level
of prices, however, was maintained
with difficulty and gave way entirely
on the appearance of the bank state
ment, disclosing an unexpected loan
expansion of $34,474,700. This is far
in excess of any previous week's in
crease in the loan item during the
history of the Clearing-house and it
was further notable for the fact that
the increase In loans has been made
by the three or four largest banks in
the Clearing-house, in which are
usually concentrated the greatest syn
dicate operations of the country's
most powerful financial groups.
There have been several large bond
sales during the week, but not suffi
cient to account for proportions of the
loan expansion. But there will be
room still for the supposition that
some great project of corporation
finance is in progress or being worked
out.
To-day's stock market closed active
and easy. Dealings at the Stock Ex
change this week have expanded to
an average of more than a million
shares a day and the growth in the
volume of the bond dealings has been
more notable.
The market for bonds has broad
ened materially, marking the presence
of abundant capital for investment.

director of the museum to succeed the
late General di Cesnola.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 22, 1905.
POOH OF LONDON ARE REM
TO BATTLE FOR BREAD.
Starving Thousands Clamor
ing for Food in Big City.
Influence of Labor Leaders
Prevents a Revolution.
LONDON. Jan. 21.â"1f you had any
pluck in you, you wouldn't stand it,
you'd revolt. D Balfour and all
his class of politicians. They'd revolt
in twenty-four hours if they were in
your position. Don't hide yourselves
in your garrets. Bring terror into the
West End and they'll listen to you
then."
So spoke a demagogue, "Jack" Wil
liams, to some two or three thousand
forlorn wretches gathered around the
base of Nelson's monument in Trafal
gar Square the other afternoon. Po
licemen heard him and grinned. Scot
land Yard had made its preparations
to deal with anything that went be
yond that most cherished of an Eng
lishman's privilges, free speech. The
mob cheered the speaker, scowled at
the stalwart guardians of the law and
dispersed to their garrets, convinced
that broken heads would not alleviate
the pangs of hunger.
Yet had John Burns, Will Crooks,
Keir Hardie and other leaders of labor
in and out of Parliament, who ignored
the meeting, attended it and brought
with them their followers and ap
pealed to them in the same incendiary
strain, it would have required more
than the police of Ixmdon to have
held in check the thousands of the
unemployed who would have flocked
to them. The West End! would have
been far worse terrorized then than
It was in "86, when, starting from the
same square, a Socialist mob went riot
ing through the streets of swelldom.
It is hardly an exaggeration to sayâ
sober-minded Englishmen who know
the English temper well have said itâ
that it is the restraining influence
exercised by men in whom the suf
fering poor have continence which
stands this winter between law and
revolution in London.
VERGE OF STARVATION.
At the present time London presents j
the most amazing and appalling spec- j
tacle in all Christendom. In the rich- !
est, the most populous and most chart- I
table city in the world, 200,000 people
are out of work and living on the verge j
of starvation. Every night sc-me 3000 j
shivering and destitute wretches wan
der through the streets hungry and
shelterless. These statements are not j
based on the wild figures of some irre- i
sponsible alarmist. They appeared in I
a plain presentation of facts made by |
Colin N. Campbell, social secretary of j
the church army, at a meen. of i
wealthy titled folk held by Inviu , n
of the Duke of Westminster ârk-htst of j
London's landlordsâat Grosvenor
House It resulted in eliciting two
checks for $500 each, two for $250 each, j
a number for minor amounts and a
lot of orders for kindling wood, by the !
chopping ot which, for two hours, pen- j
niless men earn a meal and a night's I
lodging. Scant charity this, consider- j
ing the resources of those appealed to, j
but had the contributions been tenfold ;
larger the result would have been hard- i
ly appreciable in diminishing the pres- j
ent suffering of the vast army of the
unemployed and those dependent on i
them. The best that charity can do j
can furnish only temporary palliatives ;
and postpone the application of some I
remedy that will strike at the root of
the evil.
"I could almost wish," writes Harold
Begbie, "that charity would shut up its
purse and say 'no' to the appeals of
East London. If for three weeks all
the splendid agencies for succoring the
poor were wholly paralyzedâif every
philanthropic door at which they are
now accustomed to knock were fast
shut against the sick, the hungry and
the homeless, then, I think, swiftly and
finally, a storm would break over West
minster which wduld shatter and de
stroy the reilgn of thinking Inaptitude.
The need of the hour is a statesman."
HEARTRENDING SCENES.
Winter in London is always accom
panied by hearti ending scenes of mis
ery and distress, but not for long
years has there been anything ap
proaching the present destitution. The
figures for November, when the black
clouds of distress had cast a gloom
over the land, show better trade con
ditions âas financiers are accustomed
to Interpret figuresâthan in the pre
vious November. Trade has expand
ed simultaneously with a great in
crease of the unemployed. Simulta
neously appear loud proclamations to
the world at large, based on statistics,
that England is prosperous and hold
ing her own with commercial rivals
and frantic appeals to charitable folk
at home to succor the multitude who
are on the verge of starvationâfor
help to stave off the hunger madness
and bread riots. .Obviously it would
seem that there is something horribly
wrong in the industrial system which
brings prosperity to the few and hun
ger to the multitude. Anyhow, that
is how it strikes the latter and many
others in England who are opposed
to the policy of just letting things
drift.
It certainly lent point to the appeal
made by several M. P.'s to the Pre
mier to summon a special session of
Parliament to consider fcrje matterâ
to treat it as a national question and
strive to devise some remedy for it
other than mere temporary stop-gap
measures. Balfour declined. He re-
plied. In effect, that he favored the
continuation of the palliative treat
ment. He had a very high opinion
of Parliament and of the value of
Parliamentary discussion, but Parlia
ment was hardly capable of "framing
a constructive policy." Which seems
to justify the contemptuous comment
of Mr. Crooks, a member of Parlia
ment himself, that "Parliament is all
gas."
750,000 OCT OF WORK.
Taking the latest Board of Trade fig
ures on unemployment as a basis, on a
very moderate estimate there were in
November âthere are many more thou
sands n0wâ760,000 men out of work.
Assuming'that only one-half of these
are married men with families, that
means 2,500,000 men, women and chil
dren In England in the coils of hunger,
cold and despair. The amount of suf
fering and moral and physical dete
rioration which such figures represent
is beyond the power of the imagination
to realize. And this, too, in a year of
trade expansionâof what is called na
tional prosperity. Yet the Government
calmly declines to treat it as a national
question or to summon Parliament to
consider It. It is one of those moun
tainous problems that inevitably grows
bigger the logger an effort to solve It la
postponed. Meanwhile the unemployed
are straining at the leash.
It Is hardly realized in America what
abnormal social conditions have result
ed from the ever-Increasing separation
of the people from the land and the
sacrifice of agricultural to manufactur
ing interests. Since ISSO the number of
people employed in cultivating the land
has decreased by 1,294,000, while the
population has in the same period vast
ly increased* They lie huddled together
In gross lumps, with hardly room to
turn round. Every year thousands of
acres pass out of cultivation and an in
creasing stream of people swarm to the
overcrowded cities. Englandâthe land
of Englandâis owned by an infinitesi
mal residue of the population which is
crammed within its borders. - It has
passed from the people. A few thou
sand individuals hold it all.
What has been the result? According
to a report made by a Parliamentary
committee in 1902 there, are 21,000,000
acres of land lying waste in Great Brit
ain. Over 2,250,000 people are in sore
straits to keep hunger at bay, and land
in abundance, on which they might
themselves âor many of them, at leastâ
produce the food they need now yields
nothing. The cry that now resounds
throughout Londonâthroughout Eng
landâis for foodâmoney to buy food
for the workless.
"Every unempJoyed man, be he
Duke or docker," said Sir John Gorst,
"should be set to work producing
food." But, say the advocates of this
method of making the unemployed
self-supporting, land necessary for the
establishment of such a system can
only be acquired by Government aid
and Government machinery. Private
philanthropy is unequal to the task.
What Harold Begbie characterizes as
"thinking Ineptitude" turns a deaf ear
to such appeals. Last year England's
butter, bacon, cheese and egg bill, paid
to foreign producers, amounted to
$244,000,000. It is confidently as
serted that under proper management
England herself could supply the
greater part of such foods. Anyhow,
it us urged, it would be far better to
set unemployed applicants for relief at
such work instead of restricting them
to picking oakum, breaking stones or
chopping kindling wood.
SCHEME OF RELIEF.
Another scheme which has been put
forward for relieving the strain on an
overstocked labor market and provid
ing a profitable national investment is
the afforestation of waste lands. It
finds many able supporters, who point
to the example of Germany, where the
forest industries are under state con
trol, and yield a profit to the Govern
ment of $90,000,000 annually, besides
supporting 400,000 workmen and their
families. England imported last year
$150,000,000 worth of timber, of
which $105,000,000 went for firewood.
The latter, at least, it is stated by
competent authorities, could" all be
raised on land now lying waste.
In 1886 a Parliamentary committee
reported in favor of such, a scheme,
but nothing came of it, as usual. And
nothing is likely to come of It now un
less the leash gives way. But the cry
of the idle lands for the idle hands
will have to be heeded some day.
Some means will have to be found for
checking the depopulation of the land
and repopulating it and making it
productive.
Of the scenes of misery and suffer
ing in London pages might be written
and still they would convey only a
faint idea of the reality. In one dis
trict alone, West Ham. the authori
ties report 50,000 are in the direst
want. Many of the houses are bare,
not merely of furniture, but food, and
in such circumstances as these starv
ing women, lying upon the boards of
an empty room, have brought infants
into a world unwilling to receive them.
Shoeless and in rags, hundreds of chil
dren go hungry to morning school.

OMAHA, Jan. 21.âJohn McNeil, for
nine years president of the Interna

and Ircr Shipbuilders, has been de
posed by the Grand Council of the or
der, according to information which
reached Omaha boiler-makers to-day,
on charges of selling out to the Union
Pacific In the strike settlement in the
spring of 1903.
The Crand Council, which is the
court of last resort in such matters,
has been in session at Kansas City all
the week. The charges*were preferred
by members of lodges In Omaha, which
was the storm center of the strike, by
reason of its being the headquarters of

GOVERNOR OF HAWAII
REMOVES ANOTHER SHERIFF
Unpopular Island Officer Loses His
Official Head Because of His
Arbitrary Conduct.
HONOLULU, Jan. 12.âFollowing
the dismissal a few months ago of
High Sheriff Arthur M. Brown of the
Territory of Hawaii, owing to disclo
sures made to Governor Carter by a
Pinkerton detective, another blow was
delivered to-day by the abrupt dismis
sal of Sheriff L. A. Andrews of the
Island of Hawaii.
The new High Sheriff, William
Henry, went to the island of Hawaii a
few days ago armed with full powers
from the Governor, and Sheriff An
drews' removal followed. He is not
known to be charged with any offense
against the law, but he is personally
unpopular on account of alleged ar
bitrariness, and it 's also stated that
the illicit sale of liquor flourished in
his bailiwick. He is succeeded by
Sheriff L. H. Baldwin of the island of
Maui.

JUDGE HEBBARD EN.IOINS
RAIDS ON BELDEN PLACE
Order Directed Against Chief of Po
lice, Sheriff, District Attorney
and Members of Grand Jury.
Judge Hebbard yesterday granted
an injunction prohibiting the authori
ties from continuing the raiding of
Belden place. The order is a sweep
ing one and is directed against Chief
of Police Wittman, Police Captain
Duke, Sheriff Curtis, District Attorney
Byington and T. P. Andrews and A.
M. Davis of the Grand Jury, the other
members of the latter body being in
cluded in a list of John Does. A com
plaint for such an injunction was filed
by Attorney Nagle for Elysa Malinoire
on December 22, immediately after
one of the raids complained of. No
restraining order was granted at thai
time and the police operations have
continued. Yesterday an amended
complaint was filed.
The plaintiff alleges that the eight
houses. Nos. 6% and 19 Belden place,
are lodging-houses, conducted in a
quiet and orderly manner, and the
action of the police "in uniform and
disguised as private persons" in enter
ing the premises by force and making
arrests without warrant is a violation
of property rights. The injunction is
final and will require a motion for dis
solution to set it aside, but such an
order, it is understood, cannot prevent
the police authorities from arresting
any person guilty of violation of an
ordinance.
Six Teachers Are Assigned.
The Board of Education yesterday
assigned six teachers from the sub

Jean Marcondi, a recent arrival
from Seattle, reported to Policeman
J. J. Barry on Friday evening that he
had been drinking in saloons on

ing that she had made a good "touch."
She was seen leading a man shortly

J. PIERPONT MORGAN REBUFFED
BY NOBLEWOMAN OF SPAIN.
Refuses to Sell Famllg Heirloom to Banker
WORK OF ART WHICH WAS COVETED BY J. PIERPONT MORGAN AND
THE OWNER OF THE PICTURE WHO REFUSED THE FORTUNE OF
FERED FOR THE HEIRLOOM BY THE AMERICAN BANKER.
MADRID. Jan. 21.â1t was un
doubtedly Piemont Morgan to whom
one of the 'greatest ladies in Spain
gave a rebuff lately. Dona Maria del
Carmen de Arragon y Azlor, Duchess
of Villahermosa is the owner of per
haps the finest known example of. <Ye
work of Velasquez, and she, as was
reported in a few lines by cable, has
refused an offer of $300,000 for it
from some anonymous American mil
lionaire.
"I have received innumerable con
gratulations from Spaniards, as W*H
as from foreigners," she recently said,
"for mv behavior on this occasion.
Nevertheless. I think I am not worthy
at %11 of this praise. I merely did
what I was obliged to do by the po
sition in which the heroic feats and
virtuous lives of my noble ancestors
put me. lam the direct heiress of the
dukedom of Villahermosa instituted
by Don Juan 11, King of Arragon, Na
varre and Sicily, for his son, Don Al
fonso. Furthermore, I am Countess-
Ducheas ol Luna, Countess of Quara
and Countess widow 'of Guagi. There
fore my manner of proceeding has to
conform scrupulously with the glori
ous history of my family.
"Well, among the numerous ob
jects and works of art which I inher
ited from my ancestors and now keep
religiously, there are pictures by Ve
lasquez. Murillo and Goya; and one
of these Velasquez pictures in partic
ular I was not disposed to sell. Ac
cording to the most authoritative
opinions this portrait is one of the
best works of the immortal Spanish
painter and is the effigy of Don Diego
Corral, inspector of the royal apart
ments at the court of Philip IV. Ve
lasquez painted it when he came back
from Rome in 1631.
"The portrait was extolled so gen
erally that I decided to exhibit it at
the Prado Museum, during the feasts
celebrated in Madrid Un connection
with King Alfonso's coronation, and I
left it there about a month, during
which time it was admired by many
people. It was also exhibited at the
European historical exhibition, to
gether with other portraits of my
family, and finally was reproduced in
the Senor Bernete's notable book.
'Velasquez.' published at Paris in
1898 and about to be published in
London.
REMARKABLE COLLECTION.
"In Madrid it is generally known
that the saloons of my palace contain
a remarkable collection of ancient and
modern pictures, consequently I fre
quently receive requests from both
Spaniards and foreigners to visit them,
and I grant these requests with very
much pleasure, for I think it only right
to allow everybody to contemplate the
masterpieces.
"Some weeks ago I authorized two
American gentlemen to visit my artistic
collection, and the day after, one of
them named Hamilton (if I remember
it exactly) informed me yiat he was
ready to pay me $300,000 for the portrait
of Diego Corral in the name of an
American millionaire, who had sent
him to Spain for the express purpose
of buying it. As you can imagine, this
offer was most tempting; nevertheless
I rejected It without hesitation, be
cause I felt that I should be unworthy
of my ancestry if I sold the master
pieces of Velasquez.
"Accordingly, I at once forwarded
the following answer to the American
gentleman: T thank you for your of
fer, which I esteem highly. Notwith
standing I cannot accept it I would
not sell my Velasquez picture at any
price, having resolved to bequeath it to
the Prado Museum, in order to be as
sured that the picture will remain in
my beloved Sprain forever.'
"In spite of this reply, Mr. Hamilton
repeated his offer, adding that perhaps
he could pay me a sum even greater
than $300,000, but I held to my decision
and since then have heard nothing j
more from him.
"I must own, however, that the splen- I
Special Dispatch to The Call.
did offer of that unknown American
millionaire excited my admiration, be
cause I felt that his spirit and fond
ness for art must be intense, inasmuch
as he demonstrated his wish to get the
Velasquez picture at any cost. What a
difference between that manner of util
izing wealth and the manner in wh.ch
most European millionaires dissipate
their fortunes!
"In regard to my dear Spain, unhap
pily she has been deprived of nearly all
the immense and thriving territories
that the Queen Isabel la Catolica left
to her. Luckily, however, no one can
deprive Spaniards of their glorious his
tory and artistic treasures which attest
their past greatness, and these all true
patriots must cherish as religiously as
devotees keep the holy relics. I have
tried to set an unpretending example.
"If events go on being so favorable
to the United States, the great Ameri
can nation also will be able to prJde it
self on possessing a brilliant history as
well as many artistic treasures, hut
meanwhile Americans must be con
vinced that not everything in the world
can be got through iron or gold."
MORGAN'S AGENT.
LONDON, Jan. 21.âJ. Pierpont Mor
gan has agents all over Europe to aid
him in collecting works of art, and per
haps the most experienced of these is
his English representative, whose name
is Fltz-Henry. This art expert also
buys for the IÂ»othschilds, and was of
immense service to the late Sir Richard
Wallace in forming the priceless collec
tion that now is the property of the
British nation. Fitz-Henry, too, is ad
viser in artistic matters to the Sternes,
the millionaire bankers of London, and
to a lot of other wealthy folk.
The beauties of the art treasures
which pass through his hands appeal
greatly to Morgan's English agent, who
personally bought so largely some time
ago that he was in danger of financial
trouble, but this he escaped. He has a
house in Queen Anne's Gate which con
tains a collection which many of his
principals envy and a feature of which
is its specimens of the rare French
Pate Tendre.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
HE FOUND IT
Just as Recommended.
"I bought a fifty-cent package of
Pyramid Pile Cure from my druggist
and have used two dollar packages
since. I find them just as you recom
mended them to be. I have not felt
the least sign of piles since using your
remedy three months ago. If you want
to use my name you may do so, as I
feel like a new man. I now have no
trouble with the dreadful, aggravat
ed disease.
"I meant to write you sooner, but
thought I would wait until I was
cured. I thank you for your wonderful
Pile Cure. I was a great sufferer from
piles." Fred Deerr, R. F. D. 4, New
Brunswick, N. J.
Seldom, If ever, is there any doubt
about the effect produced by the use
of Pyramid Pile Cure, as is shown
by the experience given above. The
proprietors of this remedy have thous
ands of similar letters on file, and
surely no better proof of the merit of
the preparation could be asked; when
it is borne in mind that these letters
are wholly unsolicited, there is cer
tainly cause for pride in the remedy.
Pyramid Pile Cure is sold by drug
gists for fifty cents a package, and if
yours hasn't it he will get it for you
if asked to do so. Accept no sub
stitutes, and remember there is no oth
er remedy "just as good." Every one is
urged to write Pyramid -JJrug Co.,
Marshall, Mich., for their'little book
describing the causes and cure of piles,
as it affords much useful information
and is sent free for the asking.

lectors have agents continually going
up and down the country in the hope
of bei&s able to purchase some of the
really antique things that are hidden
away in tiny villages and hamlets. Into
almost every cot has the curiosity deal
er penetrated. From long chats and re
newed acquaintance with the village
innkeeper he has learned all about the
j oldest villagers, and orfce In their little
dwellings his sharp eyes have noted
everything that would be interesting
to the collector.
NOT AN EASY TASK.
A curious old dresser here, a rare old
fireplace there, a quaint metal pot or
pitcher, valuable old china on account
of its age, etc. Nothing escapes the
agent, and it Is with great tactfulness
that he leads up to a suggestion that
they should part with their old grand
father's clock, chair or whatever it may
be. It is no easy task. There are old
folks who cannot be induced to part
with the pots and pans that belonged
to their grandfather's grandfather. Old
carved chests and settees are to the
venerable dames like their owji chil
dren. So the agent goes away, but only
to come again time after time to see
! that the rare old things have not been
' secured by some one else and to test
' again the owners' objection to selling
! them. When distress in any form comes
!to the village the agent is very keen,
, for under such circumstances he often
has been able to secure what in good
times would have been forever with
held from his grasp.
Some of the aristocratic collectors of
art treasures in England even keep
i shops, where they can display and re
sell their discoveries. Herbert Kitchen.
' whose father was the dean of Winches
ter and is now the dean of Durham, Is
one of these. Of a little cottage Just
out of Winchester he has made a per
fect treasure house of beautiful and
rare antiquities, nothing whatever
i within its walls suggesting modern

en has a small shop, where old pewter,

HARDWORKING YOUNG LORD
IN BRITISH WAR OFFICE
Donoughmore Eager to Climb the
Ladder to a High Political
Position.
LONDON, Jan. 21.âAmong the young
men who have recently been appointed
to responsible Government offices, Lord
Donoughmore, Under Secretary , for
War, is said to be the most hardwork
ing. Fourteen hours a day la his mini
mum. He is at the War Office late and
early, and so regular is he in his at
tendance that some of the humorists
among his subordinates say that he
must have a "shake down" in his room.
Only the night watchman can actually
tell when he leaves. His devotion to
duty is due to a sincere ambition,
shared by his American wife, that he
may obtain a more responsible position
later on.
Like the Duke of Marlborough, he
has broken through many of the cast
iron rules that are peculiar to Govern
ment offices. For instance, he will not
recognize that permanent officials are,
aa they think, persons specially de
signed by Providence to direct the work
of their particular departments. He in
terests himself as much in the latest
junior clerk as he does with men of>
many years' experience behind them.
He has also introduced a rule by which
young men who may be reported for
some slight dereliction of duty have
power to appeal to him before they
| can be discharged.
The Duke of Marlborough com
menced his official career in the same
way, but he waa more pliable than
Lord Donoughmore and he finally suc
cumbed to the persistent opposition of
the permanent officials at the Colonial
Office While the Duke takes life much
easier than at the beginning Lord
Donoughmore puts on more steam.
In England petticoat influence counts
for much more in securing political
preferment than It does in America,
and it will be none of Lady Donough
more's fault if her husband does not go
far. Tall and fair, with wonderful blue
eyes, and an easy, affable manner, she
makes a delightful hostess and has a
legion of influential friends in society.
But there Is nothing of the fragile,
drawing-room type of woman about
her. She is much given to outdoor life,
is a first rate golf player, a good whip
and capable horsewoman.THE EMPORIUM. j THE EMPORIUM. | THE EMPORIUM. | THE E3IPORTUM. j THE EMPORIUM. . I THE EMPORIUM. | THE EMPORIUM.

LAWSON SAID TO HAVE
PROFITED BY HIS TACTICS
Report That He Has Made Money Out
of the Amalgamated
Jugglery.
: BOSTON. Jan. 21.âThomas W. Law
son's predictions of ten days to two
weeks ago that- Amalgamated Copper
would surely declare a dividend at the
rste of 8 per cent per annum were wide
of the mark as was proved by yester
day's action of the Amalgamated di
rectors in declaring a dividend at the
old rate with one-half of 1 per cent
extra.
It Is certain that Lawson is not a
loser In the round-up. It Is charged
that he made the positive prediction of
the higher rate and then sold the stock
heavily short, figuring that the reduced
rate would cause the stock to at least
sag sufficiently to enable him to cover
at a profit. Â»
Not only this, but he Is said yester
day, before the Amalgamated meeting,
to have offered the stock In blocks of
not less than 6000 shares at 78. When
H was found that the stock would be
readily taken the offers were with
drawn.
To Lawson are also traced the recent
bear raids upon the United States min
ing stock, which have carried that
stock from 28*4 to 22. Lawson runners
were about State street yesterday cir
culating rumors that the United States
Mining dlrecors have been selling their
stock. The publication of an anony
mous newspaper attack upon the com
pany is also charged to him or bis
agent*

ANGEL-OF OGDEN GIRLS
IN COURT IN ST. LOUIS
Must Appear Before Grand Jury on
Charge of Cashing Fraudulent
Postal Orders.
ST. LOUIS, Jan. 21.âLooking sad
and distressed, the invalid wife of El
mer Smith was present at his prelim
inary hearing Friday before United
States Commissioner Gray and talked
earnestly with her husband before and
after the proceedings, but Rita and
Pauline Ogden of San Francisco, be
tween whom Smith divided the money
stolen from the Government, were
conspicuous by theitr absence.
Smith and Jacob Queller were
bound over to the Grand Jury in
bonds of $1500 each, charged with
conspiracy to defraud the Govern
ment by issuing and cashing fraudu
lent money orders. Queller, who keeps
a saloon, did not deny having been a
party to the fraud Smith confesses,
but declared he had acted innocently.
He said he thought the orders Smrth
dent to him to be cashed were all
right. Smith was a good customer of
his and he cashed the orders or sent
them to the bank he did business with
just to be accommodating.

POST OF SUPERINTENDENT
Place Made Vacant by the Resigna

OMAHA, Jan. I.âWhile specula
tion is rife as to who will.be appointed j
to the position of general superintend- I
ent of the Union Pacific, made vacant
by the resignation of J. M. Gruber to
become general manager of the Bur
lington lines east *of the Missouri
River, the suggestion is made that the
office may be abolished entirely.
Julius Kruttschnitt, director of
maintenance, is now on his wav to
Omaha from the West to confer with
General Manager Mbhler. An official
of the road said to-day:
"I think the question uppermost
just now is not regarding the best
man for the position, but as to
whether it will be advisable to leave
the place vacant."
General Manager Mohler denies the
report that E. Buckingham may be
brought from the Oregon Short Line,
saying. "He is needed where he is."

CHANGING PLAY
TO SUIT WOMAN
Author of "The Cardinal , '|
Is Altering the Drama!
for an American Actress
STUDYING AGKICULTUBE;
Daughter of Eleanora Duse
Matriculates at College 1
Where Farming Is Taught
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Jan. 21.âLouis N. Parker
Is none of your uncompromising hyper- ;
conscientious, art-or-nothlng dramat
ists of the Pinero brand. He is proving
It by the ingenious If somewhat start
ling manner ln which he is now trans
forming his play, "The Cardinal," to
suit the needs of an American actress.
As playgoers at home will remember
"The Cardinal" was written for E. S.
Willard, who produced it on the other
side of the water and appeared in It
there for a year or more before bring
ing it to this country. He played It ln
London and to some extent in the
provinces, but when he began making
plans for his forthcoming American
tour he found himself so uncommonly
well supplied with new pieces that he
decided not to play "The Cardinal" at
all, but to dispose of all the acting
rights. The British ones were secured
by Mrs. Russ Whytall, an American
member of Willard's own company,
and she will take the play into the
provinces Immediately. Meanwhile his
piece is being entirely rewritten for
Mrs. Whytall by Parker in such a way
that whereas previously the Cardinal
dominated all the scenes the heroine
now will do so.
Whether the piece still will be called
"The Cardinal" has not, I believe, been
decided. Evidently Mrs. Whytall, whose
appearances with Willard in this coun- |
try were specially successful, has de
cided to try her hand at actress-man- j
agement over here for some little time,
for she has also obtained the rights of
several other plays. Her provincial
tour began on the 16th at Eastbourne, j
Mr. Willard is leaving for the United
States next week, where he will pro- I
duce the late Wilson Barrett's play,
"Lucky Durham," ln New York on the â 
23d. Willard's repertoire also includes
"The Optimist," by Capus, a new play
by Tom Gallon, and "David Garrick."
"MADAME DUBARRY."
Having heard of the American suc
cess of David Belase "Madame Du
barry," Londoners are looking forward
with a good deal of interest to Mrs.
Brown Potter's coming production of
the Kichepin play of the same name,
which its author accused Belasco of
plagiarizing. It will be done at the
Savoyâwhere the American actress is
now appearing ln her dramatized ver
â Ton of "I Pagllacci"âand Mrs. Brown
Potter will be the Dubarry and Gilbert
Hare the King Louis. Charles Brook- i
field has made the translation of "Du
barry," which is in four acts; the most
important scenes being those of the
beauty's famous bed chamber and of
the brilliant fete at Versailles at which
she first met with disgrace.
It is going to be a really sumptuous
productionâwith scenery by Joseph
Harker, and costumes by Worth of
Paris, and there is a general hope that
the play will be worthy of its setting.
For during her season at the Savoy
Mrs. Potter certainly has shown great
pluck, if rather less judgment. Few
actress-managers would have survived :
two such failures as those of "The
Golden Light" and "Church and Stage,"
the Vicar of Gorleston's new play, but
Mrs. Brown Potter had some luck with ;
her adaptation of "Cavalleria Rusti
cana," and "I Pagliacci" in drama form
seems to have proved a real draw. It ;
will have to make way for "Dubarry" ;
at the end of this month, however, as 1
M. Richepin insists that his play shall !
be performed here at the earliest pos
sible date. Probably he Is afraid that
if It isn't, some one will get ahead of
him on this side of the water, too.
Puccrni, the author of "La Boheme"
and "Manon Lescaut," who was in Lon
don not long ago, has returned to Milan 1
and is working on a new opera which '
is on the subject of Beatrice Cenci. The :

j ADVERTISEMENTS. j
YOU CAN INTEREST HIM.
Any Man Over Fifty.
Tou can Interest any man over fifty
years of age ln anything that will
make him feel better, because while he
may not as yet have any positive or
i ganic disease he no longer feels the
! buoyancy and vigor of twenty-flve nor
: the freedom from aches and pains he
i enjoyed in earlier years, and he very
; naturally examines with interest any
proposition looking to the improvement
â  and preservation of his health.
He will notice among other things
; that the stomach of fifty is a very dif
ferent one from the stomach he pos
sessed at twenty-flve. That greatest
: care must be exercised as to what is
i eaten and how much of It, and even
; with the best of care there will be in
[ creasing digestive weakness with ad
vancing years.
A proposition to perfect or Improve
the digestion and assimilation of food
is one which Interests not only every
man of fifty, but every man, woman
and child of any age, because the
whole secret of good health, good blood,
strong nerves, is to have a stomach
; which will promptly and thoroughly di
i gest wholesome food, because blood,
j nerves, brain â  tissue and every other
â  constitutent of the body are entirely
1 the product of digestion, and no mcdi
! cine or "health" food can possibly ere
! ate pure blood or restore shaky nerves
i when a weak stomach is replenishing
! the daily wear and tear of the botly
! from a mass of fermenting half-digest
! Ed food.
No, the stomach itself wants help
! and in no round-about way, either; it
wants direct, unmistakable assistance.
', such as is given by one or two Stuart's
' Dyspepsia Tablets after each meal,
i These tablets cure stomach trouble,
\ because their use gives the stomach a
: chance to rest and recuperate; one of
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets contains di
gestive elements sufficient to digest
8000 grains of ordinary food, such as
bread, meat, eggs, etc.
The plan of dieting is simply another
I name for starvation, and the use of
I prepared foods and new-fangled break
i fast foods simply makes matters
j worse, as any dyspeptic who has tried
j them knows.
As Dr. Bennett says, the only reason
i I can Imagine why Stuart's Dyspepsia
i Tablets are not universally used by
! everybody who Is troubled ln any way
; with poor digestion is because many
people seem to think that because a
medicine is advertised or is sold in drug
stores or is protected by a trade mark
must be a humbug, whereas as a mat
ter of truth any druggist who is ob
servant knows that Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets have cured more people of in
digestion, heart burn, heart trouble,
nervous prostration and run-down con
dition generally than all the patent
medicines and doctors' prescriptions
for stomach trouble combined.

STUDYING FARMING.
Eleanora Duse's only daughter, Eliz
abeth, arrived in this country a few
days ago, having come to study farm- '
ing and horticulture at an English col- i
! lege devoted to those pursuits, in which ]
I she takes a great interest and may pos- .
'. sible adopt as a profession. She Is only
17 years old and hitherto has gone to
1 school in Germany. Much to her moth- ,
er's delight, Elizabeth Duse has no de
sire whatever for a stage life, and never
even has Been Duse act. Otherwise,
however, especially in appearance, the
two are quite remarkably alike. It Is
Madame Duse's chief wish now to re
tire from the stage and make her home
with her daughter, probably at her
beautiful palazzo in Venice.
There is a good deal of curiosity in
London to see If R. C. Carton has suc
ceeded ln getting back into his old form
in the new play he has Just had accept
ed by Frank Curzon. It is now three
years or more since the author of "Lord
and Lady Algy" has hit the bullseye.
"Lady Huntworth's Experiment" was
his last success since we have had
"The Undercurrent," "A Clean Slate"
and "The Rich Mrs. Repton," all of
which have failed on both sides of the
water. Perhaps Carton, who has written
for Charles Frohman hitherto, hopes to
change the luck by having his play pro
duced by the latter's young rival ln
London. The piece, which is a three-act
farce, has not yet been named, but will
be produced by Curzon at the Avenue
Theater early in February.
Alfred Sutro's play. "The Walls of
Jericho," which Hackett has in the
United States, is so great a succeis in
London that there is much interest in
the new play by this author, which has
Just been secured by George Alexander.
It has the rather curldus title of "Mol
lentrave on Women," and ln it Alex
ander expects to make his reappearance
as soon as the run of "Lady Winder
mere's Fan" comes to an end at hla
theater.
QUEEN MARY CABINET
SOLD IN EDINBURGH
Relic of the 111-Fated Woman Brings
bnt Little Over Two Hundred
Dollars.
LONDON, Jan. 21.âThere was sold at
Edinburgh the other day. for 1210, a
Queen Mary cabinet, whose historic
associations would make it worth con
siderably more than that to some of
the representatives of the Livingstone
family in America. It was given by the
j ill-fated Stuart Queen to her guardian,
the fifth Lord Livingstone, in 1665.
A grandson of this nobleman was
banished for refusing to take the oath
of allegiance to Charles H and took up
his residence in Holland. It was his
grandson, Sir Robert Livingstone, who
emigrated to America and founded the
family whose members have played
such distinguished parts in American
history. The cabinet is a quaint little
two-door affair, covered by bead and
needle work wrought -by the four
Marys who were ladies-in-waiting to
Mary Queen of Scots.

wondered what becomes of the money
thus obtained. This curiosity is
shared by hosts of patriotic Britons
who have paid similar tribute for
glimpses of the royal residence. An,
Intimation has been conveyed to the
King that to allay the unjust and vul
gar suspicion that some portion of the
money finds its way into the royal
pockets an annual publication of re
ceipts and expenditures ln connection
with the Windsor Castle show should
be made.
It has been officially stated that
$2000 out of the fund thus accumu
lated has been appropriated for the
erection of a new infirmary at Wind
sor. Tthe existing infirmary has ab
sorbed $500. and $400 has been be
stowed on the British Orphans' Asy
lum at Slough. But these figures ac
count for only a small portion ol the
money and the information vouch
safed has greatly stimulated public
curiosity concerning the disposition
made of the rest of it.

TITT.TOD ENGLISHMAN WHO RE
CENTLY BECAME THE OWNER
OF A CARPET FACTORY.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Jan. 21.â50 many mem
bers of the British aristocracy are now
' engaged in trade solely for the purpose
of making money that society no longer
looks askance on the peer who enters
the realm of commerce. But in taking
â  over the business of the famous old
Wilton carpet factory, which is threat
ened with ruin by foreign competition,
the-Earl of Pembroke is actuated more
. by public spirited motives than by de
sire to add to the big income he derives
from his ancestral acres. It was only
after he had failed to induce some of
â  the great London Arms to come to the
. rescue that, with the aid of Lord Rad
' nor and some other friends, he pur
chased the ancient factoryâto the de
light of the weavers, who have long re
garded the family, which owns 40,000
acres in Wiltshire, as hereditary
guardians of their industry. The noble
man, however, Is only following historic
precedent. Something like 150 years
ago another Earl of Pembroke, tenth
of the name, saved the business from
extinction in much the same fashion
when it was beset with financial diffi
culties.
At the same time the Earl intends
to run the factory on business lines,
and little doubt is felt of his ability to
make it pay. A younger brother, with
apparently scant prospects of succeed
ing to the earldom, he sat for many
years in the House of Commons and
familiarized himself with business mat
ters. It was his talents An this direc
tion which on his accession to the title
in 1595 led to his appointment as Lord
Steward of the King's Household, with
the snug salary of $10,000 a year. By
virtue of this office he dispenses most
of those interesting documents known
a< royal warrants, which are so highly
prized by tradesmen as proof that the
possessor has been honored by the
highest patronage in the land and can
henceforth claim to be "purveyors by
appointment to his Majesty." Time was
when a royal warrant might land a
suspect in the Tower or get a truculent
nobleman's head chopped off. but in
these democratic days, when monarchy
retains only the shadow of its once
tremendous authority, they serve mere
ly as advertisements to bolster up
trade.
Their influence in that respect is con
siderable, and with Lord Pembroke at
Its head the transformation of the old
works into the Wilton Royal Carpet
I * tory by means of a royal warrant
ought to be a matter of small difficulty.
All that the Earl will have to do is to
send a formal application to himself as
Lord St'ward for permission to use
that designation, and then after care
fully considering the matter formally
accord himself, or rather the company
he has formed, the necessary consent. I
ESTABLISHED IX 1700.
For more than three centuries the
Wilton folk have made carpets. Now ,
working in the factory are lineal de
scendants of some of the men whose
names appear in a charter granted to
the factory in 1700. Some of the pres
ent employes have been working there
for fifty years and it would go hard
with them if they were turned adrift
in the world in their old age. The
products of the works have more than
a national reputation. The costly car
pets, into which one's feet sink luxuri
. ously, are all hand-made, and the slight
machinery used haÂ» not been seriously
altered since the ancient Egyptians
compelled their daughters on marriage
to provide at least one carpet each for
their future hopes. Every knot of wool
is tied separately, and the finest car- '
pets, which cost about $32 a square

of wool in every square yard. Every
carpet, whatever its size and shape, is
made in one piece and despises itself if
it does not wear for 100 years. Just
now the Wilton factory is engaged on
a carpet, 41 feet by 19 feet, for an in

the present one has been there only 45

The Earl of Pembroke, whose latest
photograph is here reproduced, is 60
years old. His family is one of very
ancient lineage, with a pedigree which
can be traced back to Herbert Fitz
Herbert, who was Chamberlain to Hen
ry L A later Herbert, Herbert of Rag
land Castle, was knighted for his
valor in the French campaign of Henry
V, and his son was made the first Earl
of Pembroke in May of 1468, but at
the battle of Danes Moor he fell into
the hands of the Lancastrians, and was
unceremoniously at Dan bury.
HOME OF THE FAMILY.
The family seat of the earldom, "Wil
ton House by Salisbury," as its old
time description goes, is one of the fin
est of England's stately homes. It
stands on the site of a Jiunnery and
the first Herbert to whom it was grant
ed 1b alleged to have said to the sis
ters: "Go spin, you jades; go spin!"
The ill luck which is usually supposed
to attend despoiled Abbey lands, does
not seem to have followed the owners
of Wilton. The Earls have nearly all
been men of mark, gallant warriors in
earlier days and later distinguished
statesmen and patrons of the fine arts.
The picture gallery is famous for its
examples of Vandyke, Rubens and his
toric Sir Joshuas. Kings and Queens
and other distinguished folk have been
frequently entertained there. Shake
speare was a constant visitor at the
mansion.
Not long ago the Earl of Pembroke
had a special search made in all the
nooks and crannies of the great pile for
relics of the Bard, but nothing that
could be distinctly associated with him
was found. One great treasure, how
ever, was unearthed. That was a lock
of Queen Elizabeth's hair, given by her
to Sir Philip Sidney, and the verses in
which he acknowledged his thanks for
the gift. The hair la bright yellow and

the Virgin Queen must have had a lot
of it, judging by the generous sample
she bestowed on the gallant courtier.
Oddly enough, though this lock of hair
had been overlooked by the family for
nearly three hundred years, its pres
ence in the house was a treasured
tradition among the servants. The le
gend was handed down from house
keeper to housekeeper, and though,
when it was found, the then house
keeper had never seen it she knew all
about Its history.
Makes Early Departure.
Mr. M. SimonotT of the Golden Gate
Cloak and Suit Hduse and Pacific Cloak
and Suit House le\t last week for the
East on a hurry-up erragd. Owing to
the phenomenal success if the annual
clearance sales held at both stores dur
ing January the stocks were much more
quickly depleted than waa anticipated,
and hence the necessity of Mr. Simon
off's departure at a much earlier date
than has been his custom heretofore. The
capacity of the immense factory of Mr.
Siminoff, which in a large measure sup
plies these two retail stores, has proven
unequal to the demand made upon it.
Never before in the history of the store*
has their stock been so completely sold
out. Mr. Siminoff will hastily replenish
his stock with an entirely new invoice
of staple merchandise and the latest nov
elties in cloaks, skirts, suits, etc. The
popularity of the Golden Gate and Pa
cific Suit Houses was never more posi
tively proven than in their recent clear
ance sale.
SAID TO BE HOL.D-UP MAN.âDetectives
Regan and O'Connell of the Southern station
charged John Foran with the crime of rob
bery yesterday. He is said to be one of the
three men who entered the grocery store of
Ole Simmonson, 726 Folsom street, a few
nlghtsago and at the point of a revolver re
lieved him of the contents of th* cash register.
At the time of the robbery Foran la said to
have held Slmmonaon until two of his com
panions robbed the store.
It would be very- foolish for women
to wear clothes like men unless they
stopped being either so fat or so thin.

"WE HAVE MOTHERS, TOO,"
IS MESSAGE OF BURGLARS
Robbers Return to Child Ring Given
by Her Parent They Had
Stolen.
CHICAGO, Jan. 21.â8y a letter in
which was inclosed a tiny ring, the
gift of a dead mother to her child,
the police hope to trace the burglars
who entered the home of Millionaire
Eugene H. Fishburn, 422 Huron
street, and made away with some of
the family jewelry. The letter, which
was unsigned, was addressed to Vera
Fowler, granddaughter of Fishburn.
Inside the envelope was a small gold
ring, which had been given the gii'l
by her mother and the loss of which
had been deplored by the child mor-i
than that of all her other jewelry.
The letter read:
"Mill Vera Fowler âDear Miss: We
are not professional burglars. WÂ» rtll
have mothers, too. Inclosed is the
little ring which you said was a gift
from your dead mother. Best re
gards."
Bulkheading Mare Island Channel.
VALLEJO, Jan. 21.âThe contract
I for constructing the longitudinal dike,
2 COO feet long, for bulk heading the
Mare Island channel, was let to-day
to Healey & Tibbets for $92,300. One
of the smaller dikes on the Mai*e
Island side Is completed, another is
r&pidly approaching completion and
the one on the Vallejo side is nearly
finished. The bulkheading of the
channel will narrow and deepen the
channel so that ships of any size can
approach the navy yard in perfect
safety.
Searching for a Missing Steamship.
VICTORIA, B. C, Jan. 21.âThe
steamship Miowera, which arrived this
morning from Australian ports, was
spoken by a revenue cutter 120 miles
from Cape Flattery and asked if any
thing had been seen of a disabled
steamship. The Miowera signaled
negatively.
The average man isn't satisfied with
his lot because he doesn't eat a lot.
MANY TRADING VESSELS
LOST IN A HURRICANE
Steamship Miowera, Arriving at Vic
toria, Brings News of Severe Storm
in the New Hebrides. v -
VICTORIA, B. C, Jan. 21.âFurther
news was brought by the steamship
Miowera of the severe hurricanes in
the New Hebrides, causing heavy dam
age. Many trading vessels were lost
in the group ami buildings and dwell
ings destroyed. A Roman Catholic
school building at Villa, which was
17f. feet long, was lifted bodily by the
wind and carried several yards from
its foundations. The Presbyterian
mission station was badly damaged.
Natives of thÂ© New Hebrides at
tacked a trading station on Atchon
Island, close to Malekula, in Decem
ber, wrecked the station and mur
dtred Mrs. Germain, the trader's wife.
â Germain was visiting an outlying sta
tion. The raiders returned to the
mainland. Under the conditions now
ruling in the New Hebrides they will
not be punished until after a joint con
ference of the British and French pa
trolling warships can be held, which
may mean a delay of at least six
months.
Preparing for the Trial of Weber.
AUBURN, Jan. 21.âThe prosecu
tion in the Weber murder case has
subpenaed seventy-five witnesses and
the defense twenty-five. The trial is
set for next Thursday. It is thought
now that the attorneys for the defensa
will neither set up the plea of insanity
nor attempt to prove an alibi, but will
endeavor to break down the witnesses
for the prosecution and by the* intro
duction of contradictory testimony
confuse the jurors.
Finds Rattlesnake in a Log of Wood.
CHICO. Jan. 21.âWhile splitting
wfcod at the home of J. B. Robinson
this morning a workman split open a
stick containing a rattlesnake. The
snake was cold, but soon warmed up
and showed fight. The snake, which
is a very large one, is supposed to have
climbed into the limb of a tree for
wirfter quarters.

HONOLULU, Jan. 21.âA controll

out of the 6000 shares capital stock
of the Wilder's Steamship Company
was sold to-day to the Inter-Island

of this city for the sum of $377,000.
The new concern owns eighteen

TWO COUPLES SPEND
WEDDING NIGHT IN JAIL
Being Unable to Secure Hotel Accom

in a Police Station.
OMAHA, Neb., Jan. 21.âJust wedded
and starting on their honeymoon, two
brides and two grooms slept last night
at the City Jail in Lincoln and, appar
ently none the less happy for the rather
uncommon experience, took a train this
morning for the West.
Mr. and Mrs. J. J. Schroeder and
Mr. and Mrs. John Reimmier of Staple

of that town, who were married there
yesterday, arrived in Lincoln last night
and could not obtain rooms at any of
the hotels. In desperation they finally

their predicament and were given
lodging over night.32

ARTISTIC RIVALRY LEADS
TO ACT OF VANDALISM.
lilanseiise Smashes Prized Accordion
i,
â¦
Provoked to Deed Bu Pfayer's jeers
Signor G. Borlini, who won in fair
contest and proudly wears the medal
I awarded by Richard K. Fox to the
champion accordionist of the Pacific
Slope, chuckled gleefully when Police
Judge Fritz sentenced Miss Mamie
Sawyer to three months' imprison

â  licious mischief. The malicious mis
chief consisted of Mamie's wanton
! demolition of the instrument with
| which Signor Borlini earned his title
i and trophy. The vandal act was com-
I mitted in the Pacific-street "hurdy-
I gurdy" where MamiÂ° was the pre
| miere danseuse and Signor Borlini's
j accordion constituted the orchestra.
Artistic rivalry underlay the clash
between Mamie and the signor. Prior
Ito her debut in the dance hall his fin
gering of the accordioei was the stel
! lar attraction. Jack ashore went
! there not so much for the purpose of
tripping the light fantastic as to revel
in the accompanying strains. The
signor's repertoire was extensive and
I his execution brilliant. He kept apace
| with the latest dance compositions,
and between dances he regaled his au
dience with selections from the grand
operas and bits of popular melody. In- ;
deed, so fascinating was his output
that it relegated Terpsichore to sec
ond place in the favor of the habitues.
I They danced with feet even more re
luctant than those which support the
j sweet girl graduate as she recites her
valedictory.
I "With the coming of Miss Sawyer,
however, the dance hall again lived
up to its title instead of being merely
a music hall. Men from the forecas
tles no longer whirled and two-step
ped and polkaed in perfunctory man
ner, or preferred posing as wall flow
ers and listening to the orchestra.
They either devoted their entire at
tention to the swinging of Mamie or
eagerly awaited opportunity to do so,
ignoring all else. Was it to be won
dered at that the soul of Signor Bor
lini chafedâthat he yearned to be rid
of the new star that eclipsed him?
Was it unnatural that he hissed taunts
at Mamie every time she was whisked
past the music stand by an enrap
tured seaman? Was it extraordinary
that she retaliated in kind?
"Ah, heaven, butta she da bum
danca," the signor is reported to have
muttered quite audibly as Mamie
swung past him last Friday evening.
The same authority avers that she
thereupon shouted over one of her
shoulders at the signor: "Say, ye dago
discord promoter, why don't ye get a
hand organ or a phonograph so that
ye won't have ter do anything but
turn a crank?"
Thus elegantly flowed the repartee
until Mamie lost her temper and cre
ated such disorder that the floor man
ager was compelled, in the interest of
harmony, to summon Patrolman Nel
-1 son to effect her removal. She was
accompanying that officer quietly
enough, 'tis said, when the signor, in
his triumph, malignantly started to
play "Good-By, Little Girl, Good-By,"
whereupon she broke from her cus
todian's clutches, leaped to the music
1 stand, plucked the acordlon from the
APVEBTISEBCENTS.
THE VALUE OP CHARCOAL.
â  Few People Know How Useful It Is
in Preserving Health and' Beauty.
Nearly everybody knows that char
coal is the safest and most efficient
disinfectant and purifier in nature, but
I few realize its value when taken into
the human system for the same cleans
ing puroose.
Charcoal is a remedy that the more
1 you take of It the better; it is not a
drug at all, but simply absorbs the
gases and impurities always present in
the stomach and intestines and carries
! them out of the system.
! Charcoal sweetens the breath after
! smoking, drinking or after eating
! onions and other odorous vegetables,
j Charcoal effectually clears and im
proves the complexion, it whitens the
. teeth and further acts as a natural and
eminently safe cathartic.
It absorbs the injurious gases which
| collect in the stomach and bowels; it
disinfects the mouth and throat from
i the poison of catarrh.
All druggists pell charcoal in one
form or another, but probably the best
; charcoal and the most for the money
!is ln Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges: they
' are composed of the finest powdered
: Willow charcoal, and other harmless
i antiseptics in tablet form or rather in
the form of large, pleasant tasting loz
enges, the charcoal being mixed with
honey.
The daily use of these lozenges will
soon tell in a much improved condition j
of the general health, better complex- \
ion, sweeter breath and purer blood, j
< and the beauty of it is, that no possible
harm can result from their continued i
! use. bat on the contrary, great benefit.
A Buffalo physician in speaking of
the benefits of charcoal, says: "I ad
! vise Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges to all
i patients suffering from gas in stom
ach and bowels, and to clear the com-
I plexion and purify the breath, mouth
and throat; I also believe the, liver/is
I greatly benefited by the daily use of
1 them; they cost but 25 cents a box at
j drug stores, and although in some sense
a patent preparation, yet I believe I
get more and better charcoal ln Stuart's
Charcoal Lozenges than in any of the
ordinary charcoal tablets."

signor's grasp and utilized the wea
pon as an instrument of punishment.
So abrupt was her action that ere the
accordion could be rescued it was a |
total wreck, she having held one end !
of it while she alternately hammered
the signor and the wall with the other j

That was why the signor chuckled \
when he saw her led away with a j
three months' sentence in front of her. '

Judge Mogan dismissed the charge of
robbery that Ralph Scott had filed
against Lillie Burgess, Edith Page and
Donald McCloud, whom he treated to
supper and subsequently charged with
having pilfered his watch and $11 cash
while he slumbered In the restaurant.
Mr. Scott said he was so drunk prior to
entering the restaurant that he had no
recollection of what happened while he
was there, and the Judge rebuked him
for dragging the defendants into court.
on such scanty evidence.
â¢ â¢ â¢
His Honor Judge Mogan also sternly
chided Arthur Curran and Edward Mil
ler for haling A. L. Muraf a photogra- j
pher, into court on the charge of bat
terlng them with a poker. It was tes
tified that the two complainants aided
and abetted Miss Eva Vandruff and
the defendant's young wife to remain
away from their respective homes, and
that when they accompanied the wom
en to the residence of the defendant's
mother-in-law, Mrs. Barron, at 211
Webster street, beat them as alleged, i
"I don't blame' him for hammering '
you," said the Judge to the complain
ants, "and I'm certain no jury would
convict him for what he did."
Then it was disclosed that Miller had
served a six months' imprisonment for
robbing a Denver schoolmarm of her
jewels in a Turk street apartment
house and that Curran had been tried
for stealing a bicycle.
Mrs. Barron also approved of her son
in-law's action, but regretted that he
did the battering in her house, when he
might just as easily ha\ie performed it
on the street, where it would not have
mussed up her tidies and curtains, to
say nothing of Its effect upon the car
pet. This regret the good lady repeated
about as frequently as she alluded to
the complainants as "gentlemen," de
spite the Judge's insistent comment
that the title was misapplied.
A. Dohlberg, a building contractor,
had no witnesses to prove that hÂ« af
forded nothing akin to Justifiable provo-
by Q. W. Pastiglioni, tailor. If attempt- '
lng to collect in courteous manner
money that is due could reasonably ifbe
held to warrant such treatment as Mr.
Pastiglioni had extended to him, then
Mr. Dohlberg had deserved to be rudely
threatened with great bodily Injury.
He had built a residence for Mr.
Pastiglioni in accordance with plans
and specifications approved by that j
gentleman, Mr. Dohlberg averred, and |
It was to collect $2000 still due him :
that he went to the tailor shop at 508
California street and blandly hinted
that he would like to have the money.
Instead of meeting him with like
gentleness, however, Mr. Pastiglioni
pronounced the bill exorbitant and
commanded him to get out if he de
sired to avert forcible expulsion. Mr.
Dohlberg, still in kindly mood, en
deavored to explain that the bill did
not represent one penny more than
was called for by the contract, but
Mr. Pastiglioni scorned elucidation
and finally grasped a large shears in
one hand and a tailor's "goose" ln
the other and rushed upon Mr. Dohl
berg, who only escaped by his superior
nimbleness, he being less heavily
freighted than his assailant. The pur
suit, however, did not cease until Mr.
Dohlberg was on the street.
Judge Mogan will hear Mr. Pastig
lioni's defense next Thursday.

"An* yo' calls yoreself a contreyman

Patrolman Nelson by S. Christensen,,

bravely under the scathing words and

Judge Cabaniss finally gave up as
hopeless his endeavor to get at the bot- j
torn of the peace disturbance case in- j
volving Joseph Laugherty, Mary Rob- I
crts, his niece; Kate Dwyer, his fiancee; i
Laura Melaney, Kate's niece, and;
Frank Laugherty, Joseph's cousin, j
Mary Roberts accused her uncle of |
peace disturbance, Laura Melaney filed ,
similar accusation against her aunt j
and Frank Laugherty testified in both
cases. The deeper his Honor probed the |
more muddled did he become as to \
which of the defendants was which, so j
in self-defense he dismissed both of I
them.

Mrs. Christensen of 908 V 2 Harrison
street was unable to adduce reason
for the battering down of her front
door and the threatening of her life

lodgers. She was sure, however, that
unrequited love was not responsible
for his behavior, as he had never pro
fessed a tender attachment, nor would
she have listened to him If he had, for.

Miss Marian Holle, Miss Irene Mar
shall and Miss Ethel Smith united in
the defensive plea that they dwelt to
gether at 430 Eddy street because by
so doing they could economize in the
matter of room rental, all their spare
money being needed to pay for the
dramatic tuition they had come from
different rural homes to receive. When
three young men visited them last
Friday evening and represented them
selves as theatrical booking agents in
quest of feminine talent for a con
templated repertoire road show they
were cordially received, as each of the
ladies realized that she was qualified
to play any character acceptably and
some characters in a way that would
be cure to compel flattering recog
nition from both public and press. In
the course of conversation one of the
young men proposed that the com
pany drink champagne at his expense,
and he furnished the price of two
small bottles, which Miss Holle went
forth and purchased.
When the fizz was served, however,
its buyer complained of its quality and
pronounced it "bunk" wine, meaning
thereby that it was nothing more nor
less than cider charged ith effer
vescence and that he had been
"bunkoed." His accusation was
warmly resented by all three ladies,
and the discussion became so warm a*
to attract the attention of a prowling
policeman, who arrested them and
the complaining gentleman, Harry
Gilmore by name, and charged them
with disturbing the peace. Mr. Gil
more forfeited his bail of $10 by fail
ing to appear before Judge Mogan,
and the three stage aspirants would
have saved themselves considerable)
trouble by doing the same thing, for
a $10 fine was imposed on each of
them.

What Sulphur Cocs
For the Human Body in Health and
Disease.
.The mention of sulphur will recall to
many of us the early days when our
mothers and grandmothers gave us our
daily dose of sulphur and molasses
every spring and fall.
It was the universal spring and fall
"blood purifier," tonic and cure-all, and
'mind you, this old-fashioned remedy
was not without merit.
The idea was good, but the remedy
was crude and unpalatable, and a large
quantity had to be taken to get any
effect.
Nowadays we get all the beneficial
effects of sulphur in a palatable, con
centrated form, so that a single grain
is far more effective than a tablespoon
ful of the crude sulphur.
In recent years, research and experi
ment have proven that the best sulphur
for medicinal use is that obtained from
Calcium (Calcium Sulphide) and sold in
drug stores under the name of Stuart's
Calcium Wafers. They are small cho
colate coated pellets and contain the
active medicinal principle of sulphur in
a highly concentrated, effective form.
Few people are aware of the value of
this form of sulphur in restoring and
maintaining bodily vigor and health;
BUlphur acts directly on the liver, and
excretory organs and purities and en
riches the blood by the prompt elimina
tion of waste material.
Our grandmothers knew this when
they dosed us with sulphur and mo
lasses every spring and fall, but the
crudity and impurity of ordinary flow
ers of sulphur were often worse than
the disease, and cannot compare with
the modern concentrated preparations
jjf sulphur, of which Stuart s Calcium
Wafers is undoubtedly the best and
most widely used.
They are the natural antidote for liv
er and kidney troubles and cure consti
pation and purify the blood in a way
that often surprises patient and physi
cian alike.
Dr. R. M. Wilkins while experiment
ipg with sulphur remedies soon found
that the sulphur from Calcium was su
perior to any other form. He says
"For liver, kidney and blood troubles'
especially when resulting from consti
pation or malaria, I have been sur
prised at the results obtained from
Stuart's Calcium Wafers, in patients
suffering from boils and pimpies and
even deep-seated carbuncles, I have re
peatedly seen them dry up and disap
pear in four or five days, leaving the
Skin clear and smooth. Although Stu
art's Calcium Wafers is a proprietary
article, and sold by druggists, and for
that reason tabooed by many physi
cians, yet I know of nothing so safe
and reliable for constipation, liver and
kidney troubles and especially in all
forms of skin disease as this remedy."
At any rate people who are tired of
pills, cathartics and so-called blood
"purifiers," will find in Stuart's Cal
cium Wafers, a far safer, more pala
table and effective preparation.
SENATOR SHOOT
: ON REVELATION
Would Become an Exile if
Commanded by God to
Break Country's Laws
WASHINGTON, Jan. 21.âUnder rig
, oroua examination concerning his belief
in divine revelations Senator Smoot to
. . day in the investigation before the Sen
ate Committee on Privileges and Elec
tions said that if he should receive a
revelation from God commanding him
to disobey the laws of the land he
â  would leave his country and go to some
other country, where the laws of the
land were not in conflict with the laws
â¢ of God. He was asked what he would
do if the revelation commanded him to
: r.emain in his country and violate the
laws, but he would not suppose the
case, saying:
"The God I worship is not such a
. God."
â¢ . Nearly every member of the Senate
committee took part in the examina
tion of Senator Smoot on the subject of
revelations, and the witness' views
proved highly interesting. He declared
that revelations may come to the pres
ident of the church that were of bind
ing force, and then only when they had
been sustained by the people at one of
the regular church conferences.

Steps to Secure Punish- j
ment of Murderers, Who!
Are Hiding in Mountains
NOGALES, Ariz., Jan. 21.âFour Amer
leans and one Mexican were ambushed
and killed by Yaqul Indians on Thurs
day four miles east of Cobachi, thirty
five miles east of La Colorado, State of
Sonora, Mexico. The bodies were
brought here to-day. The dead are:
DR. R. C. COY, Chicago.
JOHN K. MACKENZIE, Chicago.
M. A. CALL, Toledo, Ohio.
WALTER STUBINGEK, Kewanee,
111.
MEXICAN DRIVER, name unknown.
H. L. Miller of Chicago, A. W. Toler
ton of Salem, Ohio and a second
Mexican escaped and* made their way
to Cobachi, thence to La Colorado. Mil
ler was slightly wounded, but the other
two were unhurt.
Dr. Coy and Mackenzie left Nogales
a week ago yesterday for Torres. From
Torres, which is south of Hermosillo on
the main line of the Benson-Guaymas
Railroad, the two men named, accom
panted by other members of their par- I
ty, went to Camp Toledo, seventy-five
miles east of La Colorado, for the pur
pose of examining mining properties
owned by a syndicate of Chicago men.
The party left Camp Toledo Wednes
day morning in two four-horse stages
on their return trip to La Colorado.
Coy, Mackenzie and Miller were in the
first stage, which was driven by a Mex
ican. In the second stage were McCall,
Tolerton, Stubinger and a Mexican
driver. The party had Just emerged
from the hills and was entering into the
flat country when suddenly, without
the least warning, a volley of shots was
poured into the first party from behind
a pile of rocks on the roadside. One of
the horsts attached to the first convey
ance fell and the vehicle was brought
to a sudden stop. Coy, Mackenzie and
the driver were killed by the hall of
bullets. The Indiana poured another
volley into the second vehicle and Call
and Stubinger were shot dead. Tolerton
and the driver of the second team
jumped to the ground and fled, making
a wide detour to Cobachi, where they
arrived about 7 p. m.
A party was organized at Cobachi,
composed of ranchers and vaqueros,
and took the trail at once in pursuit of
the Yaquis. They failed to overtake the
Indians, however, and returned to Co
bachi, bringing the bodies of the dead
men. From Cobachi the bodies were
conveyed to La Colorado, whence they
were shipped north to this city. The
bodies are accompanied by Miller and
Tarleton.
The Yaquis stripped two of the bodies
of clothing, plundered the stages of all
the valuable contents, burned one of
the vehicles and fled to the mountains.
Rings, watches and other jewelry worn
by Coy and Mackenzie were stripped
from the bodies, but no mutilation was
attempted. Mackenzie was shot through
the head and Coy through the body.
Mackenzie and Coy were both mar
ried and resided in Chicago. Macken
zie was about 43 years of age, Coy
about 40 and Stubinger about 27. The
latter Is well known ln Nogales, but
had recently been employed at the
Hotel Arcadia, Hermosillo. He accom
panied the mining men for an outing.
The party when attacked carried only
revolvers and shotguns. With these
arms the survivors of the first volley
managed to stand off the Yaquis and
make their escape.
It is understood that the Mexican
Government has ordered cavalry and
infantry from Hermosillo to the scene
of the killing, and it Is stated that
General Torres will command the
troops in pursuit of the Indians.
STATE DEPARTMENT ACTS.
Will Demand Punishment of Murder
ers by Mexican Government.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 21.âSecretary
Of the Navy Morton has received a
telegram from Enrique Creel, Gov- ,
ernor of Chihuahau, Mexico, saying
that he has taken prompt measures to
protect all Americans in the section
of country where John K. Mackenzie
and his companions were killed. He
thinks the danger Is now over.
Secretary Morton sent a personal in
quiry to the Governor concerning his
son-in-law, W. C. Potter, who started
for the Bahucrachio mines on January
8. This is about 200 miles distant
from where the MacKenzle party met
death.
The State Department will take up
with the American embassy ln Mex
lco City the question of obtaining
prompt punishment for the murderers. ,
TWO TOLEDOANS DDE.
Call and Tolerton Leave Relatives
Living ln the Ohio City.
TOLEDO, Ohio, Jan. 21.âMerrill A.
Call, who was killed by the Yaqui In
dians, Is a son of General Call, counsel
of the Santa Fe Railroad at Sioux City,
lowa, and the son-in-law of E. W.
Tolerton, a prominent attorney of this
city. Besides his wife he leaves a baby
daughter. He with A. W. Tolerton of
Salem, Ohio, was in Mexico to inspect
the property of the Yaqui Smelting and
Mining Company, in which Toledoans
were interested. Call and party left
Toledo four weeks ago. The remains
are to be shipped to Sioux City for in
terment.
â  â¦
Believe Potter Is Safe.
CHICAGO, Jan. 21.âThe last word
received in Chicago from William J
Chapman Potter, son-in-law of Secre- ;
tary Paul Morton, Is contained In a
letter dated January 8 and telling of
tdt plans to start from Chihuahua on
a trip into the mountains to look at i
mining property across the Sierra !
Madres range. This would bring him \
near- Bahucrachlo and about sixty j
miles south of the point where the I
massacre of Mackenzie and party ap- j
parently took place.
Stubinger Well Known In Kewanee.
KEWANEE, 111., Jan. 21.âJames
Stubinger, who was killed in Mexico
by the Yaquis, was a native of this
piace, but had been for two years ln
Hermosillo in the hotel business. He I
was 27 years oid. 1

men. All candidates are struggling for ]
both the Republican and Municipal
League nominations, and those who get
both are supposed to be absolutely sure
of office.
An analysis of the situation to-day
is as follows:
First WardâOne ticket to be in the
field for Frank K. Mott for Mayor and
Alexander McAdam for ward Council- â¢
man. It is possible that there may be j
a ticket in this ward for George E. |
Randolph for Mayor and Z. J. Hatch
for Councilman.
Second WardâOne ticket in the field
for Frank K. Mott for Mayor and A. H.
Elliott for Councilman.
Third WardâOne ticket in the field
for George E. Randolph for Mayor and
George Fitzgerald for Councilman.
Fourth WardâTwo tickets in the field,
one for Mott for Mayor and Edwin
Meese for Councilman-at large and C.
H. Redington for School Director. The
other ticket will be for George E. Ran
dolph for Mayor. Meese for Councilman
and Redington for School Director.
Fifth WardâThere will be two tickets
in the field. The first will be for Frank
K. Mott for Mayor, with Felton Taylor
for City Treasurer, E. H. Pendleton for
City Councilman, John D. Isaacs for
School Director and H. P. Carleton for
Library Trustee. The other ticket will
be for the same ward nominees, but
will be for Felton Taylor for trading
purposes.
In the Sixth Ward there will be two
tickets. There has been a hot fight on
in this ward for some time. M. F. Kel
ley has put a ticket in the field, which
up to the present time has been fbr Ed
win Meese for Mayor. Upon the retire
ment of Meese. Kelley announces that
his ticket will be for Mott for Mayor
and Victor CUloupek for Councilman,
while the opposition ticket will be for
W. J. Baccus for Councilman.
There will be only one ticket in the
Seventh Ward, which will be for Coun
cilman J. T. Wallace and probably for
Randolph for Mayor.
The big fights of the day will be in
the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth wards.
This gives the First and Second to
Mott. with the Third and Seventh to
Randolph, and the Fourth, Fifth and
Sixth to be fought for.

Human hair
and how
to grow it
The hair of the head has
1 always been a source of
pride to both men and
women throughout all the
world's history, and its loss
or deterioration is a source
of keen mortification
and regret.
From time to time
various so-called remedies
for falling hair and the
various diseases of the
scalp have been foisted upon
the public, and the failure
of these to do any perma
nent good lias only added
disappointment to discour
agement.
One remedy, howeverâ
Coke Dandruff Cureâ
has proved itself capable
of doing everything
claimed for it and of being
worthy of the confidence of
a much abused public.
It will remove dandruff,
it will cure diseases of the
scalp, it will put new life
into the old follicles, and
consequently will actually
grow hair on a bald head.

CO-EDS WILL GIVE "THE MIKADO"
Pretty Varsity Girls to Sing fop Charity's Sake
BERKELEY. Jan. 21.âGirls of the
Prytanean Society, an organization at
the State University whose member
ship is limited to "co-eds" distinguish
ed in scholarship or in work fbr the
university, is preparing to present the
comic opera "The Mikado" next month
at the Macdonough Theater in Oak
land.
. The undertaking is one of the most
ambitious the college thespians have
yet attempted. Dramatic performances
are not uncommon at the hands of the
college actors, and often are brilliantly
successful, but the Prytaneans think i
that in attempting to render a comic i
opera, where singing parts abound, they j
are daring something just a bit beyond
what hitherto has been thought possi
ble for either "co-eds" or male students
of the university.
It is to be all for charity's sake. The 1
Prytaneans purpose building a hospital
for students in Berkeley, and the pro- I
ceeds of "The Mikado" show will swell
this fund. Incidentally, a big bevy of !
pretty college girlsâcollege girls who
can sing and also "carry a spear" and ;
otherwise do stage businessâwill enjoy !
themselves in producing the famous
old comic opera by Gilbert and Sulli
van.
The date of the production has been
fixed for February 24. Mrs. Janet Ed
mondson Walker of Boston, with Clin
ton R. Morse, is to coach the co-eds in
the rehearsals. The principal parts are !
to be assigned to-morrow, tryouts hav
ing been held during the last week at
which seventy candidates presented
themselves, twenty of these being aspi
rants for principal parts. Among those
who are expected to be prominent in
the production are Misses Myrtle Sims,

wrestling, by I. J. Anloff and Louis
Haselbacker; fencing, by Emil and l
Otto Fritsch. and juggling, by George I
Tessio and George Durning.
Mitchell Found Guilty.
It required but a few moments last I
evening for a jury in Judge Lawlor's ! 1
court to return a verdict of, guilty
against John Purvis Mitchell, charged
with robbery. Mitchell was accused of '
holding up two clerks. Alfred B. Phipps
and Frank J. Flynn of the Central
Grain and Stock Exchange, and rob
bing them of a suit case containing
$4378 85 in cash and $3200 in bonds and
securities. The clerks were met in a
small hallway by Mitchell, who drew a
revolver and demanded the wealth they 1
had in their possession. Shortly after
Mitchell made his escape he was trailed
by detectives and a portion of the
stolen money was found in his home.
Judge Lawlor w ill pronounce sentence

WOEK OF UNIVERSITY
â¢
Needs of Department of Ag
riculture Given Special
Emphasis in the Document
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
214S Center Street, Jan. 21.
All the activities of a great university
are described in the biennial report pre
pared by President Benjamin Ide
Wheeler and sent by him last night to
Governor George C. Pardee at Sacra
mento. No department of any of the
colleges is overlooked in the resume of
all their work, prepared by President
Wheeler, the report giving the reader a
I birdseye view of the work accomplished
[ by the small army of officers, students
and instructors at the State university
on the hills of Berkeley.
President Wheeler calls attention to
a significant circumstance revealed by
tne registration figures, this being the
trend of male students away from the
pure cultural courses toward the en
gineering and scientific colleges, leav
ing the classical or culture courses to
be dominated by the women students.
Regarding this feature of the uni
versity's life the president says:
"A comparison of the distribution of
undergraduates among the different
colleges in 1901-2 with that in 1903-1
shows that the three colleges of gen
eral culture have slightly declined,
their total in the former year being
1430, in the latter 1403; and relatively
to the entire undergraduates they have
significantly declined, their proportion
of the whole being in the former year
â¢J3.6 per cent and in the latter 57.7 per
cent. The six technical or special col
legesâagriculture, mining, mechanics,
civil engineering, commerce and chem
istryâhave each, with the exception of
the last named, grown both abso
lutely and relatively, and taken to
gether have practically absorbed the
entire growth of the undergraduate
body.
" This comparison of the two groups
of colleges shows, therefore, that a pro
cess of automatic segregation is being
gradually accomplished, and it is one
which is very generally deplored in the
university faculty. It certainly is to be
regretted if this university is not to
train men in considerable numbers, as
well as women, tor the pursuit of stud
ies in literature, language, history,
philosophy: if men, in their preference
for the applied sciences, are to leave
pure science prevailingly to the women;
U the education which makes to
rounded culture is to be the exclusive
privilege of women.
"The present tendency to make the
general culture colleges women's col
leges and the special colleges men's
colleges oughÂ£ not to be, and I think
will ultimately prove not to be a per
manent one. But it will continue un
til the profession of teaching in our
State, whence comes our principal un
dergraduate constituency, shall offer
greater relative attractions to men, or
a greater number of our men come to
devote themselves to the fields of
higher scholarship in science and the
humanities, instead of being diverted,
as. with the exception of candidates
for the professions of medicine and
law, the ablest and most energetic in
cline to be now, into the practical ap
plications of science. As the stand
ards for medical and legal education
come to be established in this State on
a worthy basis, the college of social
Sciences will be recognized as the
chief pathway to the study of the law,
and the college of natural sciences to
the study of medicine, while the col
lege of letters will continue to offer
tin? one safe- route for those who look
toward higher scholarship in litera
ture, linguistics, philosophy, history
and all the sciences of human life and
thought."
The great growth of the agricultural
department of the university is com
mented upon by President Wheeler,
who says: .
"In comparing the progress made by
the- different departments in the past
two years it appears that the depart
ment of agriculture has made the
most significant development. The
number of regular students of agri
culture in 1903-04 representes a gain
of 75 per cent over 1901-02. For the
same period the units of registration
inAgriculture increased from 1584 to
i. e., 65 per cent, the greatest
gain of any department. It must be
remembered that the number of stu
dents from other colleges taking
courses in agriculture far exceeds the*
number in the college of agriculture
itself. During the past year the total
number of students in agricultural
classes, including the short courses,
was 415, of whom 278, or 67 per cent,
â¢were from other colleges than that of
agriculture, i. e., students not taking
the full agricultural course."
The need of a farm in connection
with the agriculture college work is
described by President Wheeler to be
most urgent. The notable work per
formed in Professor Jacques Loeb's
department is made the subject of the
following paragraph:
"The work of the new department
of physiology, under the brilliant lead
ership of* Professor Jacques Loeb, be
gan with the building of the new labor
atory at a cost of $25,000, the gift of
Rudolph Spreckels. The laboratory
was dedicated August 20, 1908, with an
address by Professor Wilhelm Ostwald
of Leipzig. The part of the equipment
used for instruction and research was
provided at an expense of $8000
through the liberality of Dr. M. Herz
stein of San Francisco. The nucleus
of a departmental library was pur
chased with a gift of $2500 made by
Mrs. William H. Crocker of San Fran
cisco."
The splendid new library building,
made possible by the bequest of Charles
F. Doe, is the subject of preliminary I
plans by John Galen Howard. The i
president says of this matter:
"Plans for this building are already
far advanced. The leading librarians
of the country have been consulted,
first as to the main features and type
of the structure by Supervising Archi
tect Howard in person visiting them in
their own libraries, and, secondly, after
the outline plan had been established
through correspondence and the sub
mission of copies of the plans. It is evi
dent that the building we must plan
for will cost when completed in all its
parts between $800,000 and $1,000,000.
The funda provided will therefore be
insufficient to build the entire structure
at once."

fessor of architecture, fs described in

BACHELORS WHO

BY ZOE GftEEX RADCLIFFE.
OAKLAND, Jan. 21.â"0h, for a jfin
mie Phelan or a Dick Hotallng over
here," sighs the Oakland "bud" as she
reads glowing accounts of the social
stunts of those two millionaire
bachelors. Only the other day Mr.
Hotallng gave a Japanese affair for
Miss Bates that out-Japanesed the
Japs, and every day we read of some
gorgeous entertainment at which some
bachelor is host. Whether it is because
Oakland has no unmarried millionaires
I am not prepared to say, but sure it
is that when maids on this side of the
bay would be entertained "papa" or
"mamma" must prepare to pay the
piper. Even the dances are planned
and can*led to success by the chape
rones. Apparently we have no Ned
Greenway, even in a chrysalis stage.
On second thought I retract that last
statementâwe have a whole bunch of
embryo Green ways. The P. D. K*s. (the
most popular High School fraternity in
town) are planning a dance for Febru
ary 17 that promises to eclipse any
thing that has been given this season.
The Phi Delta Kappa fraternity in
cludes a clever lot of young fellows,
and they never do anything by halves,
so the lucky girls who have already re
ceived bids are in a pleasant flutter of
excitement.
â¢ â¢ â¢
In spite of pouring rain last night
the Friday Night Club's dance was a
delightful success. Reed Hall, garland
ed with smilax and adorned with innu
merable potted plants, never looked
prettier, and the girlsâwell, Oakland Is
famed for her pretty girls, and many
of the most attractive are members of
the Friday Night. Two of our most
charming young brides-to-beâMiss
Cordie Bishop and Miss Jane Crellinâ
were there, and looking very sweet and
happy. Miss Bishop wore a chiffon
gown of her favorite blue, and Miss
Crellin was very stunning In a pale
green liberty chiffon. Miss Ethel Crel
lin was also in green. One always
wants to take a second look at Crissie
Taft, and her gown of white satin and
rare lace attracted many an admiring
glance last night.
Miss Burnham is another girl that al
ways dresses beautifully, and she wore
a very elaborate creation of pink satin
shirred and ruffled in an indescribable
but charming fashion. Miss Helen Nel
son was in white, and Miss Pearl King
wore a beautiful gown of the orchid
gray.
Miss Gertrude Allen in a black spang
led net and Miss Kleeman in white lace
lined with pink silk wore two of the
prettiest gowns in the room. Dainty
Laura Sanborn was a bonny figure in
blue-embroidered chiffon, and her sis
ter. Miss Sanborn, was also beautifully
gowned in gray chiffon. Some of the
other girls who looked especially well
were Misses Clarisse Lohse, Helen
Chase. Kate Jackson, Katherine Brown,
May Cooganâin a pink-embroidered
tulleâElsa Schilling and Rose Kales.
The patronesses, to whom much
credit is due for the success of the
Friday Night dance, are: Mrs. T. C.
Coogan, Mrs. D. H. Mathes. Mrs. Wil
liam H. Chickering. Mrs. Edward M.
Walsh and Mrs. J. F. Sims.

Miss Marie Hopps, who is again th<?
guest of Miss Noelle de Golia, \vas the
motif for a delightful little affair yes
terday, planned by Miss Cordelia
Bishop. Eleven young ladies were in
the party, that first enjoyed luncheon
and later an informal musicale. The
table was all in redâcarnations fur
nished the keynoteâand looked very
pretty.
The bUle coterie of girls who enjoyed
Miss Bishop's hospitality, including the
nostess herself, consisted of several of
the most accomplished members of the
smart set. Pearl King not only recites
unusually well, but is a clever musi
cian. Miss Bishop. Carolyn and Anita
Oliver. Marion Smith and May Coogan
are all pait of the sextet that made its
debut at Miss Taft's tea, and. of course,
contrihaued much to the pleasure of the
afternoon yesterday. The other guests
were Miss Hopps. Miss de Golia. Miss
Marion Walsh, Miss Ruth Kales and
Miss Helen Chase.
Next Thursday Miss Chase will en
tertain a few friends at an informal
sewing bee for Miss Hopps.

Miss Sallie Worley was the central
figure of a theater party this afternoon,
ing, the Rudolph Spreckels laboratory
and minor structures on the campus.
It is suggested by the president that
the building erected at a cost of about
$30,000 for use as the president's house
be utilized by the department of archi
tecture for Instruction purposes.
Mentjon is made of every department
of the university in the report and its
progress noted in detail. The income
of the university for the year 1902-03
was $688,909 80. Of this sum $64,750 12

erty now valued at more than $600,000
for this purpose. Of this amount
$500,000 is to bo invested in interest
bearing securities for the maintenance
of the hospital for all time. The rest
of the money is to be expended for
the buildings. The plan is to have a
hospital that will accommodate 100 pa
tients. A large part of the estate left
for this purpose is realty and cannot
at present be converted Into cash, and
there Is some doubt as to whether, un
der the conditions, work can be begun
until the entire estate is turned Into
cash and securities. The hearing of
the petition was set for January 30.

English Physicians Want
Study of Hygiene and Tern-1
perance Made Compulsory
AMERICAN PLAN SUITS
Eminent Doctors Aroused j
by * Report of Committee \
on Physical Deterioration;
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON. Jan. 21.âInspired by the j
i scheme prepared by Mrs. Mary A.JHunt
for use in the schools of the United
' States, and upon State enactments for
: the compulsory teaching of hygiene
I and temperance, the physicians of
I Great Britain have set on foot a na- j
i tional movement of much significance, i
', to which the newspapers have as yet j
1 given practically no attention.
J A petition addressed to the Central
! Educational authorities, and calling at
i tention to the pressing need of such mi
i struction, has been signed by upward
!of 15,000 members of the medical fra- i
j tenity. Included in the list are the !
! names of all the most eminent physi- !
cians in the United KingdomâSir I
Thomas Barlow, Sir William Broad- '
bent, Sir Lauder Brunton, Sir Victor j
i Horsley, Sir William Macewen, Sir
J Henry Thompson and a host of others,
jNo demand has ever been presented to ',
i the Government that is backed by a
â¢ greater weight of expert * authority. |
Medical opinion is unanimous on the i
subject. The question is one that does
j not admit of dispute. 4
British authorities are always slow j
iln jsdopting reformatory or remedial i
j measures after the, heed of them has
been abundantly shown. They have to I
be subjected to a great deal of ham- j
mering to make them do things that
they have not done before. The report I
of the Committee on Physical Deterior- i
ation has aroused the doctors of the
CDUhtry to the necessity of bringing
pressure to bear on the Government
which will force it to take steps to pre- :
vent the threatened racial decadence, f
"The committee believes," they stated, '
"that more may be done to check the I
degeneration resulting from 'drink' by
bringing home to men and women the
fatal effects of alcohol on physical ef- j
flciency than by expatiating on the
moral wickedness of drinking. To this
end they advocate the systematic prac- !
tical training of teachers to enable
them to give rational instruction in
schools on the laws of health, includ
ing the demonstration of the physical
evils caused by drinking."
AMERICAN SYSTEMS.
The reports made by members of the .
Mosely Commission on American sys
tems of education, showing how defi
cient are the English schools in impart
ing knowledge of practical value, pro
vided an additional stimulus to the
doctors in their self-imposed task. In
the report of the committee of the med
ical profession in charge of the matter,
of which Sir William Broadbent is
chairman, especial emphasis is laid on
the example set by the United States.
"Every one of the United States of j
America," Englishmen are there told, ;
"includes among its education laws
provision for the compulsory teaching
of hygiene and temperance. Further,
the laws of the United States of Amer
ica require the examination of teachers
in these topics."
The English physicians want the
same kind of instruction given in Eng
lish free schools that has long formed
part of the curriculum of the American
public schools. The movement is one
of the many indications that John Bull
is bent on drying hard to catch up
with Uncle Sam. The lamentable lack j
of elementary literature on temperance
and hygiene in England Is strikingly
illustrated by the fact that in prepar
ing the suggested course of teaching on
these subjects the committee has taken
as its model Mrs. Hunt's scheme for i
American schools.
TEMPERANCE AND HYGIENE. j
The committee proposes that temper
ance and hygiene, which now have no
place in the code of the. Board of Edu
cation for elementary schools, should ,
be given third place, following after the
ADVERTISEMENTS.

English language, which comes first,
and arithmetic.
The Board of Education, with that
partiality for half measures character
istic of British officialdom, is engaged
in a belated effort to formulate provi
sions for the training of teachers in
hygiene, but. as the medical committee
points out, "the equally urgent subject
of temperance is not provided for, and
we desire to urge respectfully that the
disastrous effects produced by alcohol
on the nation require that the subject
of temperance be given a prominent
position in any syllabus of teaching ln
hygiene and elementary physiology."
The average lower class Englishman
drinks twice as much liquor as the
American wage-earner, and can only
half as well afford it. Besides he spends
four times as much leisure in public
houses while consuming It. Unless this
waste of money, time and health is
checked English reformers are con
vinced that no amount of technical
and industrial training will enable Eng
land to long retain even second place
to the United States in the race for
commercial supremacy.
Python as Woman's Pet.
LONDON, Jan. 2LâTtje erase among
society women for strange pets is
growing apace. The inseparable com
panion of one woman is a devoted py
thon twelve feet long. Another is so
attached to a boa constrictor, big
enough to crush her to death in a mo
ment if so Inclined, that it accompanies
her everywhere on her travels. Pet
monkeys, rats, mice, guinea pigs and
various strange little quadrupeds from
strange lands accompany their fair
owners to the Italian circus now per
forming in London, under the supposi
tion that the entertainment will minis
ter to their enjoyment.

Is more, Impairs their beauty. Sev
eral belles are excusing themselves oc
casionally from balls and other so
cial functions to give it a trial.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 22, 1905.
IMPORTANT CHANGES
IN PARISHES. '
ARCHBISHOP'S APPOINTMENTS
FOUR PRIESTS WHO WERE YESTERDAY PROMOTED BY ARCHBISHOP RIOR
DAN. FATHER DEMPSEY GOES TO THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION
CHURCH. OAKLAND; FATHER McUUAIDE TO SACRED HEART, FATHER
SI 'LLIVAN TO THE CATHEDRAL AND FATHER LALLY TO SAN JOSE.
! For some days there has been much
interest shown in the probable appoint- >
ments which would be made by Arch
bishop Riordan, in view especially of ,
the vacancies which have been made
| through the demise of two pastors of
important Catholic churches, the Re^.
1 Father King of the Immaculate Con
ception Church, Oakland, and the Rev.
Hugh Lagan of Sacred Heart Church,
Fillmore street, this city.
In The Call of Thursday. January 12, i
it was predicted that Father Edward ,
Dempsey would succeed Father King,
but not until yesterday morning was
Father Dempsey informed of his ap
pointmentâindeed, none of the results
of the council which was held during
the week was made known until yes- i
terday.
There could be no stronger choice for J
the Oakland parish than Father Demp- ;
sey. During the eleven years he has j
acted as assistant priest at St. Mary's '
Cathedral his worth has been amply j
demonstrated. He is a friend of the j
poor and an adviser whose words are
welcomed. Father DempsÂ«y has won
the regard of all classes, and his de
parture from St.Â» Mary's Cathedral will
be considered a personal loss by nu
merous persons in and out of the par
ish.
Father Dempsey is a native of Oak- I
land and with his family had lived for
years in the parish with which he has
become identified. He was educated at j
St. Mary's College.
FATHER LAGAN'S SUCCESSOR.
The next appointment of importance '
to the Catholic community is that of
the Rev. J. McQuaide, who retires from
tfhe pastorate of the Church of the Holy i
Redeemer and succeeds Father Lagan
as rector of Sacred Heart Church. "
Father McQuaide was born in San
; Francisco and received his education at <
St. Mary's College. After graduating (
he was stationed for a while at San I
Rafael, and from there went to the i
Philippines as chaplain of the Califor
nia regiment. He was also ln China ]
j with the American troops during the j.

Boxer outbreak, and on his return to
San Francisco was made pastor of
Holy Redeemer Church, which had Just
been established. During his pastorate
there We caused to be erected a new
church and residence and established
a prosperous parish.
The Rev. Father William P. Sullivan
leaves St. Teresa's Church to succeed
Father Dempsey as assistant priest at
the cathedral. He was born in San
Francisco twenty-five years ago and at
tended Sacred Heart and St. Mary's
colleges and was sent in 1898 to Lille,
France, by his mother, Mrs. M. Sulli
van, to complete his studies for the
priesthood.
In June, 1903, the young priest re
turned to San Francisco to be or
dained, the ceremony taking place in
St. Mary's Cathedral. For about six
months he remained assistant priest at
St. Mary's and was then appointed to
St. Teresa's. Father Sullivan is a pro
found student. He is beloved by all
who have come in contact with him
during his connection with the church
which he now leaves.
The Rev. P. McGuire of St. Patrick's
Church, San Jose, is made rector of the
Church of the Holy Redeemer. San
Francisco, succeeding Father McQuaide,
and the Rev. Father John A. Lally of
Haywards will take Father McGuire's
place at San Jose.
Father Lally was born in Detroit,
Mich., and graduated from Detroit Col
lege. The Very Rev. Father Frieden, S.
J., present president of St. Ignatius
College, was then vice president of the
college at Detroit.
SOME INTERESTING FACTS.
Father Lally pursued his theological
studies and went later to La Salle Uni
versity, Quebec, the oldest university in
Canada. After completing his theo
logical studies he came to California
on account of ill health and was or
dained in Old St. Mary's Cathedral May
30, 1885. by Archbishop Riordan. A re
markable fact of the ordination was
that Father Lally was the first priest
in California to be ordained by the
Archbishop, who had but recently ar

GREAT BUILDING STANDS
EOR PROGRESS OE TRADE
Merchants' anil Produce Exchange Celebrate
â¢ At the stroke of 11 o'clock yester
day morning the last business transac
tion of local brokers took place ln the
dingy quarters on the second floor of
tile old building at San some and Sac
ramento streets that has served as the
home of the Merchants' and Produce
Exchanges during the construction of
the handsome building at California
and Leidesdorff streets. Immediately
thereafter the traders formed in line,
and, headed by a band, marched into
the magnificent new structure. There
speeches were made and refreshments
served.
The formal speechmaking concluded
With a presentation of a gold watch
and chain to L E Dutton, who, as
representative of Architect Burnham.
did much toward hurrying the com
pletion of the building. In his reply
button thanked the members and
made an appeal to the wealthy mem
bers of the exchange to give money
toward the decoration of many bare

panels on the south wall and urged
that only the best painters be engaged
to decorate them with typical Cali
fornia scenes.
.'â¢ Friendly rivalry was indulged in by
the members to see who would be the
last to make a sale in the old exchange
' building. The honor fell to Emil
'Waterman and William Baer, who
jointly effected a sale of wheat. A. J.
Gove, for fifty-four years engaged in
wharflng, warehousing and shipping,
sent the first two telegrams in the new
exchange.
While the affair in the big building
was going on a party of twelve
bickers, representing many firms in
the Grain Exchange, met at Del- J
monico's and had a banquet and cele- j
oration of their own. This was caused
by the failure of the Merchants' Ex
change to send them invitations, al
though the men had been doing busi
ness on the floor of the exchange for
many years. The invitations were sent
out only to members of the Merchants'
Rxchange. These representatives were
not members, and. not caring to ask
tot admittance, and feeling hurt at be
lnk ignored, held their own jolliflca
tidn.
I IN THE NEW BUILDING.
As the brokers filed into the pit that
will hereafter be scene of their
struggles the band that had preceded
them into the hall ranged in a semi- i
the bulletin boards and
discoursed popular airs.
President William Babcock, the
beard of directors and the guests of
honor took their places on a temporary
platform erected near the center, of
the south side of the hall. President
Babcock told of the work of the or
ganization, its influence on the life of
the community and the work involved
in the construction of the building.
Judge W. W. Morrow of the United
States Circuit Court was the next
speaker. Judge Morrow has just re
turned from Washington, where he
prevailed upon the Carnegie Institute I
to give an appropriation of $10,000 per
annum for five years to aid Luther
Burbank. the horticultural expert, in
the development of his work? Judge
Morrow spoke in part as follows:
' Through my knowledge of the ways
of the small merchant, the butcher, the
baker and the like, I expect wonders
from these merchants here, who have
at their command the telegraph and
the cable, and whose actions, figurative
ly speaking, move the world.
"This building marks an epoch in the
history of San Francisco, which is on
the eve of great commercial growth.
The Pacific will be the carrier of com
merce in the future, and the next twen
ty-flve years will see such growth as
the world has never witnessed before.
The war in the Far East must soon
cease, and Japan and Russia will be
rivals only in commercial life. China
will soon awake and create a great
market for our goods, the Philippine
trade will reach great proportions, the
Panama canal will be open and the
United States will see that all contro
versies on the Pacific are settled by ar
bitration."
JOHN P. IRISH TALKB.
G. W. McNear, the oldest member of
the exchange, a charter member of the
Produce Exchange, from which sprang
THEijAT CALL
the Merchants' Exchange, who for
nearly forty years has followed the for
tunes of the grain market, then gave a
brief outline of the history of the ex
change and* the work of obtaining new
quarters for the present organization.
He was following by Colonel John P.
Irish, Naval Officer of the port of San
Francisco, who spoke as follows:
"I was present at the opening of the
old Produce Exchange and remember
with what pride the speakers at that
time referred to their organization. The
doings of the soldier or sailor, the
statesman and ecclesiast, are recorded
in history, while the producer, the mov
ing factor, figures but little in the an
nals of the world. The producer is the
founder and promoter of the world's
civilization and peace.
"The relation of the prosperity of the
Pacific Coast to the future trade of
Asia depends on the integrity of China,
and treaties made with that nation
must and will be respected. The mag
nificent place in which we are gathered
bears testimony to the enterprise and

SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, JANUARY 22, 1905.
MISSION PARK
LANDS OFFERED
Two Jewish Societies Make
Tender of Two Blocks to
the City for That Purpose
Price at Which Owners De
sire to Sell Aggregates
the Total Sum of $292,000.
City Attorney Long yesterday sent a
communication to the Board of Super-
visors relative to his negotiations for
the purchase of lands for Mission Park,
stating that he had received offers of
sale from the Congregation Emanu-El
and the Eureka Benevolent Association
to convey good title to Mission block
No. 86 for the sum of $152,000, and that
of the Congregation Sherith Israel to
convey good title to Mission block No.
87 for the sum of $140,000.
Mr. Long advises the board to pro
ceed to consider the said proposals, fix
the price which the city and county of
San Francisco is willing to pay and no
tify him of its action therein, where
upon payment may be made on the
final approval.
The money is available for the pro
ject immediately, as the banking syn
dicate has purchased the bonds issued
for the improvement.
"It required a great deal of work to
run down the title," said Assistant City
Attorney John P. Coghlan, who had
charge of the negotiations. "Both
blocks were originally part of the San
Miguel ranch, which was granted to
Jose Noe by Pio Pico, the last of the
Mexican Governors, and was one of the
most valuable grants in the history of
California. After the cemeteries" en
tered into control there were a number
of transfers and other transactions that
were never fully cleared up until re
cently, when the title of the blocks was
submitted to the City Attorney's of
fice."

Following closely upon the death

Clad only in a shirt his dead body
was found crouching on the floor in
his room at 131 Montgomery street,
the left leg resting upon a demijohn

two months ago and was being treat-!
Ed by physicians from the French
Hospital. He told persons in the ;
house that he was receiving pensions
from the French and American gov

abstemiously and was noted for his i

A New Banking House.
The importance of San Francisco as one of
the world's financial centers is nowhere more
manifest than in the marked growth of her
tanking institutions. Many new banks have
been established by local capitalists and a
number of large Eastern banking-houses have
opened branches here. The latest addition is
ihe private banking firm of N. W. Halscy &
Co. of New York and Chicago, who have fitted
up elaborate offices at the corner of California
and Sansoroe streets. The business will be in
charge of Mr. Cyrua Peirce, who for many
years has been engaged In Investment banking
in Philadelphia.
JURORS BREAK
MONNIER WILL
Unanimously Decide in Fa
vor of Contestant Upon
Five Points Submitted
BELLIGERENTS AT BAR
Judge Graham Admonishes
Attorneys Sullivan and
Collins Not to Be Rash
Â« ââ
After listening to evidence and argu
ments in the case for twenty-nine days,
the jury in Judge Graham's court yes
terday returned a unanimous verdict
in favor of George Monnler Jr., break
ing the will of his father. George Mon
nier, the winemaker and liquor mer
chant, who left a fortune of $160,000.
The jury found that the contestant
was the legally adopted son of George
Monnier and his wife; that he was the
illegitimate son ot the wineniaker; that
his father in UW2 had publicly acknowl
edged the boy as his own s"n and had
received him as such, with the consent
of his wife, Anna, into his lamiiy. and
thenceforth had continued to acknowl
edge him publicly and treat him as a
legitimate; son; that after the birth of
the contestant the elder Monnier, in
writing signed in the presence of a
competent witness, had acknowledged
himself as the father of the contest
ant; that the instrument dated Janu
ary 17. 1901, a?.d tiled September 10,
WH, purporting to be the last will and
testament of George Monnier, was pro
cured through undue influence exer
cised upon George Monnier by Anna
Monnier, his wife.
These findings were given in affirma
tive answers to each of five written
interrogatories submitted to the jury
by the Judge, who instructed the an
swer of "Yes" to the first question, as
to the legality of the contestant's adop
tion. The questions regarding parent
age, however, had no direct bearing
upon the validity of the will, which
hinged alone upon the alleged influ
ence of the wine man's wife. The evi
dence on this point during the trial
brought out stories of quarrels and
hatred between the son and his adopted
mother.
TO DIVIDE FORTUNE.
Monnier willed all his property to his
wife. He had previously deeded her
their home, valued at $45,000, and this
she will keep; but the remainder of
the estate must be divided with the
young man who deemed her his mother
until the day she first denied it in
court.
Attorney Matthew I. Sullivan con
cluded his argument in ihe case short
ly before noon yesterday, and it took
Judge Graham fifty minutes to read
the instructions to the jury, the prin
cipal point of which was that the ques
tion of / young Monnier's legitimacy
should not be considered in determin
ing the question of undue influence.
The Jury went to lunch before pro
ceeding to its deliberations, and at 2
o'clock notified the court that a verdict
had been reached. The attorneys were
telephoned for and arrived half an hour
later. Mrs. Anna Monnier was not pres
ent, but the contestant, his wife and
little daughter were on hand to receive
the good news. George wept when he
heard the verdict, and his wife hugged
a woman friend in ecstacy. Attorney
Collins immediately excepted to each
of the jury's findings and filed notice
of motion for a new trial. He says the
case will go to the Supreme Court.
JUDGE AS PEACEMAKER.
After the* jury had been charged and
retired at noon Judge Graham sought
to offer his good offices as peacemaker
between Attorneys Sullivan and ColÂ»
lins, who had made a scene the day be
fore. The crowded courtroom was on
the gui vlve. Galling the lawyers be
fore the bar, the Judge said to Sulli
van: "Yesterday something was said
by you regarding the counsel on the
other side, io which Mr. Collins took
exceptions. I did not desire then to
f;ay anything, either Â«>ne way or the
other, fearing to influence the jury.
Mr. Collins said that he would hold you
personally responsible for your words.
1 notice in the papers that counsel in
tends to break somebody's jaw."
"I did not say that in this courtroom,
your Honor," interrupted Collins, and
the Judge continued: "I sincerely trust
that you wilt remember the high
standing cf your profession and have
?ome consideration for this court. You
f-hould strive nobly in trying the causes
of your clients, but you should eat and
drink together as friends."
Said Mr. Sullivan: "As far as my at
tack went, I was simply replying to
an attack by Mr. Collins upon Mr.
Roche and myself. No personal en
counter will .take place in which I am
the aggressor."
Mr. Collins, addressing the court,
said: "I do not feel called upon to give
any promises."
Up to the hour of going to press this
morning no blood had been shed by
either cf the attorneys.
CITY SAVES INTEREST BY
BONDS REMAINING UNSOLD
Delay In Taking Up of Municipal Is
sue Causes Surplus in Interest
Fund.
Figures were compiled yesterday in
the office of the Board of Supervis
ors showing that the city will save
more than $100,000 ln Interest on the
new municipal bond issue owing to
the delay in taking up the bonds by
financial institutions.
Last June a tax was levied to pay
the interest on the bonds for the year
beginning July 1. 1904, and ending
June 30. 1905. As the bonds, with the
exception of those purchased by the â¢
banking syndicate, did not pass from
the city's possession it follows that
the city will not be called upon to re
deem the interest coupons until such
time as the bonds are purchased. To
pay for the first year's interest a tax
sufficient to raise $184,436 was levied.
This amount includes- the interest
amounting to $20,860 to be paid on
the Telegraph Hill bonds, which have
since been, declared invalid and have
therefore nipt been issued. It is quite
likely that the parcel of bonds
amounting to nearly $5,000,000 for
which bids have been invited on Feb
ruary 20 next will not be taken up un
til toward the end of the fiscal year,
when all legal formalities are com
plied with, and thus an additional
amount "of the total interest of $184,
--486 will be retained by the city.
MARRIES MAN
OF HER CHOICE
Bride Leaves Fiance on Eve
of Wedding and Gives Her
Heart and Hand to Another
MOTHER HAS HYSTERICS
Discomfited Groom Threatens
Vengeance and Arrest of
His Rival for Perjury
Oakland Office. San Francisco Call.
1016 Broadway, Jan. 21.
Leaving a prospective bridegroom
preparing for his wedding to-morrow,
Katie Shenson, daughter of Harris
Shenson, proprietor of a dairy produce
establishment at 957 Folsom street, San
Francisco, ran away this morning with
Sam Greenberg, the man of her choice,
tind was married here by William R.
Geary, Justice of the Peace.
As a sequel to the elopement, the
girl's mother* accompanied by the dis
appointed lover, arrived at the County
Clerk's office this afternoon in a state
of hysteria and great excitement. When
the fact that her daughter was really
married dawned upon her the mother
fjkinted. The discomfited suitor, ashen
hued. went to the District Attorney,
threatening to have his rival arrested
for perjury on the ground that the girl
was not yet of age. The mother's con
dition, however, demanded his atten
tion until after the time for closing up
>f the office, and he will have to wait
until Monday for his tardy revenge.
The explanation made by the young
couple at the time of the ceremony was
that the girl's parents had arranged a
match for her with J. Lenko, a business
partner of the father in his shop on
Folsom street. For years the girl had
been keeping company with her present
husband, and when she had approached
to within a day of the time set for her
marriage with Lenko she gave way to
the entreaties of Greenberg and be
came his bride.
The news of the elopement was tele
phoned to the parents by Mrs. H. Levin
<>i 412 Fifth street in this city, a sister
of the bride, who this evening said:
"I am sorry lor my sister and sorry
for my parents. They are old
fashioned with their ideas and
believed they had a right to
make my sister marry the man they
wanted. She has known Mr. Greenberg
for many years, and while he is con
siderably older than she that is no
reason why they should not be â¢ very
happy. I did. ajad mar
ried the mau* agmnst my
parents' consent, and I have never re
gretted my act; and I don't see why
she should not be equally as happy.
Mr. Lenko is riy father's partner, and,
of course, it will make matters rather
unpleasant for them, as he has as much
say in the business as father has, but
it cannot be helped."

VENERABLE CLERGYMAN
ENDS LONG PASTORATE.
Rev. Dr. Pond Resigns Pulpit
REV. DR. WILLIAM PONDi NOTED CONGREGATIONAL MINISTER AND PAS
TOR OF BETHANY CHURCH AT TWENTY-FIFTH AND BARTLETT STREETS.
WHO HAS RESIGNED PULPIT AFTER THIRTY-ONE YEARS OF LABOR.
Bethany Congregational Church is
to lose its â  beloved pastor, Bey. Wil
liam C. Pond, who has been the spir
itual adviser of the faithful Mission
congregation ttor more than thirty
years. Dr. Fond has presented his
resignation, realizing that age is fast
creeping upon him. His congregation
is loth to accept the resignation of the
venerable preacher, but he is satisfied
that the arduous duties are too much
for him in his declining years.
No minister of any denomination is
more widely known through the State
than is Dr. Fond. It is safe to say that
he is the most popular exponent of
the Congregational creed in California,
and at every conference of the church
he has taken an active part. His la
bors in the cause have done much
toward the advancement of religion on
the Pacific Coast.
Dr. Pond came to California a young
man in the days of the pioneers. Short
ly after his arrival here Bethany Con
gregational Church. Bartlett and
Twenty-fifth streets, was built. The
people wanted Dr. Pond as their pas
tor, but he could not accept the ealt
at the time, so they decided to wait for
a whole year till he was ready to take
the pulpit.
Dr. Pond has since remained at thÂ«s
head of the church. He has seen it
grow and thrive. He has officiated at
the marriage of those whom he had
baptized in years gone by. And during
all those years the devout pastor had
the unfaltering good will of every
member of his flock. His word waa law
in the church, and there was not a
member of his congregation who would
not do anything in his power at the
suggestion of his beloved pastor.
When the trustees of the church
heard of Dr. Pond s determination to
resign they immediately called a meet
i ing and personally requested their pas
tor to stay with them for a short time
at least. But when Dr. Pond explained
that, having reached the ripe age of
75 years, he keenly felt the need of
rest, the board reluctantly accepted the
resignation.
By a unanimous vote the directors
decided to bestow upon their faithful
leader the title of pastor emeritus. This
is a distinction that falls to the lot of
but few clergymen. It is safe to say
that Dr. Pond will continue to occu
py a foremost place in the esteem of
his churchmen, even though another
acts as their lender and spiritual ad
viser.
Dr. Pond will not be idle, even though
Pages 37 to 48
retired from active pastoral work. HÂ»
! has for years been an ardent worker
:in the cause of the Chinese and Jap-
I â nnese missions, and he will continue to
labor for their benefit as long as his
strength holds out. He has accom
| plished much in this line, and at pres
! ent has work of importance laid out
I that will occupy a great deal of his
! time.
Dr. Pond's two sons are prominent in
professional life. One, Professor James
H. Pond, is principal of the Oakland
High School and one of the most prom
inent educators in the State. Another.
Dr. Gardner Pond, is an oculist of
note, having practiced ln this city for
some time. ,

HYLAND TRAINS
FOR HARD BOOT
Is Taking No Chances in
His Condition for the
. Fight With Frankie Neil
Â».
OUTWEIGHS OPPONENT
For the First Time in His
Extended Ring Career
He~ Has This Advantage
Dick Hyland, the boxer, who will face
Frankie Neil when he makes his debut
as a professional on the last day of this
month, is working in an earnest man
ner at the Ocean Beach under the di
rection of Jack McCormiek. Like all
amateurs there is a possibility of his
overdoing his work in his ajixlety to
b? thoroughly trained.
He is boxing with Spider Welch and
a number ot other boys of various
weights and is able to tire them out
<.ne after another. He resembles Tom
Sharkey both in 1 his build and in his
features and is as great a glutton for
work. Like Sharkey, he takes a dip
in the ocean daily.
He will have a slight pull in the
weights when he meets Neil, as his best
righting weight is 122 pounds, while the
last time Neil fought here he scaled
only 115 pounds. Neil has never
thought anything of giving away
weight in many of his fights. Hyland
has had the same experience, this
being the first time he has fought a
man lighter than nimself.
â¢ Neil is expected to prove the faster
1 ace* of the pair, but Hyland's friends
expect him to weather the storm of the
l ist few rounds after which they think
ho will gain a decided lead. Both are
hard hitters for their size and there
will be some lively give and take work.

urements there is little to choose be

his name has something to do with it.
At any rate, all sorts of reasons were

There was only a minute pause at

an ovation by " the big Saturday gath
ering.
Favorites performed satisfactorily,
three purses falling their way. Despite
the threatening condition of the weath
er the big bettors were out In force and
the layers did an immense business.
YELLOWSTONE FINISHES FIRST.
W. Davis is a great boy for throwing
a natural with his mount in the first
event on the card. He had the leg up
on Yellowstone in the introductory
sprint, and in a timely drive beat Edu
cate, the pacemaker, a length. Lloyd
Fountain on his father's horse Doublet
annexed the show. Little Bummer was
the post favorite, but physical infirmi
ties prevented him from shining. He
showed a spark of speed and then faded
away. The winner had second call in
the betting.
Achelita, a sturdy looking Ally by
Libertine-Monrovia, sporting the colors
of A. B. Spreckels, master of Napa
Stock Farm, captured the two-year-old
scramble. Ridden by Bell, her price re
ceded from 4% to 9, and she scored eas
ily from F. W. Barr and I'm Joe. Cap
tain Burnett, coupled in the betting
with Yearning, enjoyed a pronounced
call in the ring. Davis rode the former,
on which the stable pinned its faith. He
got the colt away poorly and that is
the end of the story.
While the clouds are lowering and the
rain continues falling Halnault it would
seem as cdl from the can. Jack Reavey's
gelding ruled an odds-on choice for the
seven-furlong selling number, and took
the purse without effort. He had Davis
for a pilot, and scampered in nearly
three lengths ahead of Red Cross
Nurse. The Fretter, at 16 to 1, ran
third. Tarn O'Shanter, after mapping
out the early pace, stopped to nothing.
The mile and 100 yar% purse, run for
three-year-olds, had all the earmarks
of a boat race. The price about Sea
Air went to 3 and Was then pounded
down to 12 to 5. With Knapp up, the
Ally went out in front and was never
headed or bothered to speak of. Yada,
which finished last on Tuesday, took
the place from Ara* the miserably rid
den third choice. t
TRACK NOTES.
W. Davis rode two winners.
Twenty-four bookmakers cut in,
showing a healthy Increase over the
last drawing.
Pop Ward was one of the newcom
ers on the block. He ault winner on
the day's booking.
John Bullman has gone away on a
duck-shooting tour. He must have in
dulged ln this favorite pastime to some
extent at Oakland before he left That
is, the wins of Hlpfconax, Captain For
see, Achelita and Elliott would indi
cate such.
Lissak, the sire of .Claude, was*
named in honor of Louis Lissak, a
member of the board of stewards of
the association across the bay. As a
two-year-old Lissak defeated Cadmus
and a big field for the Spreckels hanÂ»
dicap, which event is now known asÂ»
the Burns handicap.
Once more has Red Cross Nurse
changed hands. Entered for the third
race in the name of the Fleur de Lis
stable, the mare was claimed for
$1025 by George Wentworth, trainer
of Scotch Lad.
Jake Holtman leaves for Los An
geles to-night, where he will do th*
starting at Ascot park for the next
five weeks. Dick Dwyer will officiate
at t the barrier across the bay toy
morrow.
Alarie demonstrated by his handling
of Elliott that if given the oppor
tunity he is far better than an ordi
nary hand. If the so-called "bush
rider" will keep in mind that the wire
is the best place to get the money the
opportunity now opens for htm to
make a reputation.
An erroneous impression gained
some credence that on account of the
weather racing would be transferred
from Oakland to either Tanforan or-
Ingleside. President Wiyiams stated
yesterday that no such change waft
held inj contemplation or had even
been considered. There are other in
terests besides those of the turfman.

WOMEN ATHLETES MEET
AND DISCUSS BUSINESS
Club Will Soon Be Incorporated and
Work of Outfitting Gymnasium
Soon to .Follow.
The eleven women comprising the
board of directors of the Woman's
Common Sense Athletic Club met last
night at the Teachers' Club in the
City Hall to make arrangements for
the inauguration of the club. Miss
Bertie Clifford, the treasurer, reported
that seventy-five women had signed
the roll and that there is $186 in the
treasury.
The women are anxious to secure a
permanent meeting place, so Mrs. A.
T. McGary and Miss Clifford were ap
pointed a committee of two to look
after quarters. Dr. Mary Halton and
Miss Claire E. Donovan were named
to look out for the incorporation of
the club. Miss L. Herenghi and Mrs.
Anna M. Kirk were instructed to con.,
tract for printing for the club. The
next meeting of the club will be held
on Tuesday night in Judge Sloss'
courtroom. All the members are
urged to attend. A permanent meet
ing place will probably have been
found by that time and the work of
organizing the new club and making
arrangements for a gymnasium will
be taken up without further delay.

JIMMIE BRITT CAUSES
ARREST OF COFFROTH
Manager Is Taken Into Custody on a
Charge of Misdemeanor
Libel.
Jimmie Britt swore to a Warrant last
night charging James Coffroth with
misdemeanor libel. The charge grew
out of an article recently published, in
which Coffroth is quoted as having de
nounced pugilists as having no reputa
tion, devoid of gratitude and fit sub
jects for jails. Coffroth is further quot
ed as having said that in every State
a prize fighter is deemed a felon, and
this vent of spleen aroused Britt's ire.
John J. Greeley, attorney for Britt, pre
pared the complaint and Judge Frits
issued the warrant. Coffroth surren
dered himself and was released on $25
cash ball.
Greeley threatens to bring charges
against the Belvedere, an O'Farrell
street resort, for having deceived the
public and obtained money under false
pretenses. Greeley says that when the
restraining order was granted, prevent
ing the Belvedere people from using
Britt's name on their advertising cards
they issued a deceptive bill that would
lead the public to believe that Britt
waa still to be an attraction at the
showhouse. These charges will be pre
ferred before the Police Commissioners.
Will Improve San Jose Track.
SAN JOSE, Jan. 21.âAgricultural
Park, which in years past was famous
as a racecourse, has been leased by
F. S. Granger and T. W. Barstow for a
period of ten years. The park is
owned by the San Jose Land and Ex%
hibit Company, which has been man
aging the grounds for the last ten
years. Granger is a railway promoter
and was the means of building the San
Jose and Los Gatos Interurban Rail
way. At present he is located at Santa
Cruz. The lessees will .establish a
chutes and other amusement features
and an effort will be made to have
some of the big races of the State
take place there. Barstow is one of
the most prominent horsemen in the
State and it is believed the track will
be made the training quarters of many
of the best horses. At present Lou
Dillon, the queen of the turf, is
wintering there. Messrs. Granger and
Barstow will spend 1100,000 in fixing
up the place and turning it into one
of the leading amusement places on
the Pacific Coast.

.Unloading the Manchnrla.
Although the liner Manchuria Is
scheduled to sail again for the Orient
.on January 28, there Is some doubt as
' tr> whether she will be ready for sea
by that date. She brought a large
_>argo, about 12,000 tons, and there is
enough freight waiting for her to fill
her up to .her full capacity, nearly 14.000
tons. The rain yesterday morning
greatly retarded the work of discharg
ing, as the merchandise had to be pro
tected from the water, which at times
poured from the heavens in almost solid
sheets. A large army of stevedores is
engaged ln the work, which is in prog
, ress at every one of the big liner's nu
merous hatches and cargo ports. The
men will work night and day until the
Manchuria is ready for sea. With
proper equipment the task would be
simple enough, but handling cargo
from a twentieth century steamship
with the gear of a bygone age Is slow
work at best, and in the event of a
rush involves wear and tear out of all
proportion to the results. As the work
continues the problem increases ln
complexity, for every bale landed on
the wharf adds to the congestion and
makes more difficult the labor of get
ting outward-bound cargo alongside
the liner.

City Lots Accurately and Officially Sorveye*.
CHARGES REASONABLE.
My field books, diagrams show, by actual
measurements, the exact points from which I
your lot was surveyed, which is Imperatively
necessary, as the City Surveyor and otherjmâ
veyors do not show that, and also because all
the original monuments were taken out when
the streets were formed In the early days of
the city, since which time the different City
Surveyors extending to the present time have
made Innumerable errors in their street and
lot surveys, and tf> conceal such errors they
have moved the monument lines away from
their original correct positions without legal ,
authority from tbe people, causing blocks and '
streets to measure incorrectly, creating excess
measurements ln blocks of the most valuable
portion of the city, which they do not distribute
proportionately throughout tbe block, but often ,
give the entire excess of sometimes) 12 inches
or more to one person, thereby interfering with
the deed distances of tbe people and the abso
lute security of boundary lines.
Consult me before moving your valuable
buildings on such unfair surveys. Work guar
anteed.

Fruit Packers Oppose Measure.
SAN JOSE, Jan. 21.âThe dried
Fruit Promotion Committee, which is
trying; to formulate a plan to make
the fruit growing industry profitable,
is opposed to the bill now pending 'n
the State Legislature limiting the
hours of employment of women to
eight a day. This matter was dis
cussed at the meeting of the commit
tee. It is claimed that in the fruit
packing and canning industries, es
pecially during the busy season, it is
necessary for the girls to work late.
They are paid extra for the overtime
and always seem anxious to earn the
extra pay. The men at that time
work ten hours per day. A commit
tee consisting of Messrs. Burke, Tan
tau and Hooke waa appointed to op
pose the measure before the Legisla
ture.
Herring nets hung in festoons in the
ohancel of Yarmouth parish church
were solemnly blessed by the vicar on
Sunday night, October 2, preparatory
to the starting of the fishing fleet next
moraine. '* "n* â '
STANDARD OIL
IS INTERESTED
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 21.â1t looks as
If one of the biggest battles of this
session of the Legislature will come
up on the bill Introduced in the Senate
by Emmons and in the Lower House
by Dorsey, providing that all pipe lines
for the purpose of conveying crude
petroleum shall be deemed common
carriers. Standard Oil influences will
be here to defeat the bill if possible.
Three agents of that corporation are
now on their way from New York to
make the fight against the bill, which
will be begun in committee.
Senator Greenwell, chairman of the
Committee on Manufacturers and Oil
Industry, received a letter from D. G.
Scofleld, vice president of the Pacific
Coast Oil Company, asking that a
hearing be given the opponents of the
bill. Some evening next week will be
set aside for this hearing by the com
mittee. It may be a lengthy one, as
both sides will have many arguments
to make and much statistical matter to
introduce.
The selection of a site for the pro
posed hospital for the convict insane
of the State, which will be ln fact a
prison, was considered at a meeting
of the Assembly Committee on State
Prisons and Reformatory Institutions
yesterday. Superintendent Hatch of the
various State hospitals for the insane
appeared before the committee and
urged that the prison for the insane be
located on the grounds of the Folsom
prison.
No bill has been Introduced provid
ing for such an institution, but one
framed by the committee will be pre
sented soon. There are about sixty
five insane convicts scattered about
through the asylums of the State. Ob
jections are made by people having
relatives in the asylums that they do
not want convicts kept in those institu
tions with them and besides it is
deemed that the convicts who may be
feigning insanity are not safely held in
these places.
Another argument ln favor of placing
the proposed prison for the criminal in
sane at Folsom is that it will stop the
feigning of insanity, as there will be no
object in prisoners trying to be trans
ferred to an asylum that gtVes them no
more chance to escape than the one

A bill designed to stop the scalping
of theater tickets is being prepared in
San Francisco and will be introduced
in the Legislature by Assemblyman
Jones of that city. It will make it a
misdemeanor for any one to sell a
theater ticket at an advance over the
advertised price or for any manager
or proprietor of a theater to give out
tickets to be so sold. X Ut
The bill introduced by Assemblyman
Johnstone of San Dimas making it a
misdemeanor to sell to any one a vine
cutting, tree or plant that is anything
Â«^rTilf t fJL!.t^ epr vf sented has been
reported favorably by the Committee
on Fruit and Vine Interests. Great
damage has been done many farmers
â  and orchardists of the State through
the sale to them of vines and trees that
1 proved to be of different varieties from
what they thought they were get tine
The mistake Is usually discovered after
three or 'our years of expensive"culti
vation, which goes for naught under
these circumstances. X undei
Ths one trouble with Johnirtone'. MB
Is that the imposition is not usually
discovered until the trees or vines are
in bearing and the person who sold
them, if still in the State, can claim
he thought they were what he sold
them for. The bill, it is claimed, how
ever, covers the ground as far as pos
sible.
At the request of business organiza
tions Assemblyman Mitcheltree is to
introduce a measure increasing the
time in which a bill shall be outlawed
from two to four years. At present,
unless a judgment is obtained, the
statute of limitations operates in favor
of the debtor at the end of the second
year. In .other States the limit is from
four to sfx years.

Houser to Introduce a Bill Which Is
Aimed at Certain Dealers.
SACRAMENTO? Jan. 21.âAssem
blyman Houser of Los Angeles will in
troduce in the Assembly Monday a
measure making it a misdemeanor
for any dealer in goods of any sort,
the sale of which is not prohibited by
law, to refuse to sell such goods to
any citizen who proffers the market
price.
The bill is aimed to crush the prac
tice that at present prevails concern
ing some lines of goods of selling only
to those who belong to some trades
union organization that makes use of
those goods in carrying on their work
and thus forcing citizens in general to
hire certain work done that they
could do themselves.
"There are conditions in Los Angeles
and I suppose in other parts of the
State that make such a law neces
sary," said Assemblyman Houser.
"To give one example:* In our city
an ordinary citizen cannot buy in any
store, except perhaps one, which is
trying to maintain its independence, a
piece of pipe if he wants to do a lit
tle plumbing in his house on his own
account. .Any one wishing to pur
chase must show that he belongs to
the proper trade organization or he
must hire the work done and pay
whatever bill is presented."
The proposed measure is one that
will be fought by union labor.
Elopement Bill Will Not Pass.
SACRAMENTO. Jan. 21 Any
young and romantic couples who have
been anticipating the delicious enjoy
ment of a real elopement and have

bly bill that would prevent runaway
and secret marriages becoming a law
before the opportune moment for
their flight had arrived may regain
hope. The bill will not become a law.
It has been reported back by the Ju
diciary Committee with the recom
mendation that it do not pass.

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, Jan. 21.âWeakness in the wheat
market . developed early In the session and
toward the close all semblance of support was
lacking. Influenced by a strong market at
Liverpool, initial quotations showed slight
gains. May being up %Â®%c at $1 15%Â®
1 15%. For a time a leader of the bulls sup
ported the market, but there were few pur
chasing orders from other sources. Pit traders
were moderate sellers. Toward the end of the
first hour offerings increased considerably end,
with no insprovement In demand, the market
gradually weakened. Domestic news was gen
erally favorable to the bears. Cash markets
!at ail grain centers were very dull. A report
from Minneapolis stated that stocks of wheat
there decreased only 119.000 bushels. comparÂ°d
with an expected reduction of 250,000 bushels.
Receipts in the Northwest were quite large
and predictions were made that the movement
would continue on a liberal scale for some time
to come. Total primary receipts were ln ex
cess of those of the corresponding day a Wear
i ago arrivals to-day being 671.900 bushels, as
against 639,000 bushels last year. Such bear
! ish Influences gradually undermined the mar
i kut so that late in the session prices declined
rapidly. Profit taking by longs who did pot
1 wish to hol.i their lines over Sunday Increased
I the weakness. The low point on May for the
sr-ssion was reached at $1 13%. The market
closed weak, with May at $1 14Â®1 14%.
The action of the wheat market was the
I principal factor in the corn pit May Â°Pfned
! unchanged to a shade lower at 44% c to 44%Â®
i 45c, sold oft to 44%@44%c and closed at 44%Â®
1 44% c
i Tho volume of trading In oats was exceed
ingly small and, following the action of other
trains lower prices prevailed. May opened
Tshade higher at 81%0 and closed at 30%Â®

was weak" for low-gTade stock, river Burbanks
particularly being- ln heavy supply and dull. |
! Strictly fancy Burbanks were firmly held at j
i the outside quotations, but there was very
i little such stock to be had. Onions ruled firm ;
lat the recent advance under continued light
I receipts.
Receipts of southern vegetables were rather 1
light, but there was plenty of carried-over j
' stock of all descriptions available. Summer ;
1 Squash and Egg Plant were quoted lower and I
! prices of Beans and Tomatoes -had a wider j

me.-tic points were liberal throughout. There
I has been very little Inquiry for Turkeys, !
i either live or dressed, and under liberal re- |
i celpts, particularly of the latter, that descrlp- i
â¢ tlon has been very weak during the past few I
days. Game was firm under moderate receipts
snd a good demand an) several kinds were-!
I higher. â  â

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
Butter closed the week at a further advance,
i with the market practically cleaned up. The
j situation Is as follows: Most of the season's j
j cold-storage stock has been sent Bast during
â  the past few weeks and lhat remaining is
| chiefly medium and low-grade stock; Los An
geles Is taking the San Joaquin creamery out-
I put, and as the Humboldt production is low
|at this season this market is getting little
from there, while, the northern markets are j
1 taking liberal shipments from San Francisco j
by every steamer and the local consumptive
demand is also good. All these factors keep
the market cleaned up and very stiff.
Cheese continues weak, with dealers offering
it freely to one another.
Eggs were lower again and very weak at the
decline, with reoeivcrs offering ranch at con
cessions. There was quite k carry-over at the
close.

Clubwomen Who Are Going
to Los Angeles Urged
to Inform State President
BY LAURA BRIDE POWERS.
Heigh-ho, clubwomen! Going south
to lhc federation foregathering? If you
are then impart the information to the
president of the State Federation, Mrs.
George Law Smith, 222Â« Jackson street,
else you'll have to part with an extra
five-spot to transport you to the Wom
en's Club house, 940 South Figueroa
street, Los Angelea.
A round-triD rate of $15 is offered to
every clubwoman In California or
friend of a clubwomanânot only to
delegates, ladies, rememberâbut .to
every one of you, provided sixty tickets
are sold from about the bay. Now, in
order to get at the facts of the case,
there is an immediate necessity of com
municating your decision to Mrs.
Smith, who has the matter of trans
portation in hand. Do so, good friends
do so to-day if you value that five-spot
of commerce. And I haven't yet found
a clubwoman who doesn't. Have you?
A failure to secure the five dozen
transportations herein mentioned will
put a rate and a third into operation.
If 100 women announce their Inten
tion of attending the convention then

congratulation to intending passengers.

ear with a group of clubwomen after a j
lively session?

In the preparatory work for this an

Robert McF. Do bio, a well-known
consulting engineer, lectured before
the Pacific Coast Railway Club at tho
Palace Hotel last evening on the us
of Pacific Coast water power in th"
eiectrical operation of railroads. With
stereopticon views he illustrated th>'
progress of mechanical art in the
manufacture of .locomotives up to the
time of the .introduction of eleetri< 
motors and followed with a series of
views showing the great improvement
already made in the latter. He de
scribed the great water powers of Cal
ifornia and gave his hearers much val
ue ble information as to the ultimate
use of these waters in the generation
ol electric power for the future opera
tion of overland trains and city an<l
interurban electric lines.
