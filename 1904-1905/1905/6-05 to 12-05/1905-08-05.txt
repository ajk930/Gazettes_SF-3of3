Charles Moore after robbing the restau
rant of Espa Cenopulos. at 1 eighth,
street, last night attempted to shoot tha
proprietor, who made an effort to capture
him. Cenopulos owes his Ufa to a defec
tive cartridge, as the thug deliberately
pointed the gun in his face and snapped
the trigger. After running several blocks
the fiend was overtaken by policemen
and charged at tha Southern station with
robbery.
Shortly after 9 o'clock last night Moora
entered the restaurant and ordered a
meal. He asked for some fruit, evidently
knowing that the proprietor had none in
stock and would be compelled to go to a
fruit store near by to get some. On re
turning from bis errand the restaurant
man discovered Moore robbing tho till.
Moore fled and Cenopulos pursued him.
At Eighth and Mission streets he over
took the robber and grappled with him, â¢
Moore drew a revolver and fired point
blank at Cenopulos. The cartridge proved
defective, but Cenopulos released his grip
and Moor,e continued his flight. He ran
down Mission 'street, with Special Police
man O'Nell in pursuit. He ran up Sev
enth street to S.tevenson, and then
through a lot to Market street.
Policeman Charles Goff saw the fleeing
man cross Market street, near Seventh, ;
with a revolver in his hand. Goff pluck
-Ily and with a threat ordered the thus
to throw up his hands. With the threat
"I'd get you if I hadn't thrown my
cartridges away," Moore submitted to ar
rest. \u25a0 ' ,
Moore hart $5 65. H* admitted he had
taken $4 50 from the till, and brags that
he would have killed Cenopulos and Goff
if he had had the use of his weapon. He
is a heavy-set fellow, about 24 years of
age. He says he is a machinist* and Is
from Chicago. The police believe, how
ever, that they have a' desperate man
with a record.

It has been definitely ascertained that
Belcher had several thousand dollars at
least when he disappeared last Monday.
During three days Just before his flight,
aTter he had been confronted by evidence
obtained by bank examiners and had
made confession cf his crimes to them,
he went from one to another of those
who had implicit confidence in his Integ
rity and without any further security
than his personal promise to repay loans
was able to borrow thousands of dollars.
There are many who believe that he had
secreted many thousands of dollars In
addition and that he carried away with
him a comfortable capital with which to
make a new start In South America or
some other foreign land.
It Is now a well ascertained fact that
Belcher has been a thief and a forger, for
at least a dozen years, descending to the
level of the common pickpocket in. rob
bing those who trusted him with amounts
as small as one dollar. He has -on sev
eral occasions escaped exposure only | by
applying on his knees to his victims and
working upon their selfish Interest, prom
ising that if he were given time he would
make good their losses.
These exposures have . convinced the
Paterson business men that he is not the
kind of man who would take his own life.
Thai he will ever be; heard of again Is,
doubted; that the warrant issued at the
eleventh hour will result in his arrest is
not considered within the range of proba
bilities. \u25a0
NEW YORK. Aug. 4.â At last a war
rant has been issued for William H.
Belcher, who is still Mayor of Paterson,
N. J. He is charged with embezzlement,
and the police department has been or
dered to use its utmost endeavors to take
the missing man into custody. But that
he will be located is doubted by every
one In Paterson who. Is at all familiar
with the facts In the case. On the lips
of everybody to-day In the city where
for so many years he was looked up to
as a model citizen, husband and father
was the charge that "the meanest thief"
had by this time placed hundreds of miles
betvrcen himself and his former home.

ATLANTIC CITY. Aug. 4.â Mayor
Story has issued an edict forbidding the
fair sex to appear on the beach in
cream-colored bathing suits. . A num
ber of the younger society leaders of
Philadelphia and Baltimore, who are
both fair; arid shapely, appeared on the
beach in the kind of costumes tabooed
by the Mayor. No end of. confusion fol
lowed immediately and a crowd of men
of all ages gathered on the board walk.
It. had been claimed, that the suits
were practically transparent. Protests
were made by several ladies who do
not venture Into the surf and the Mayor
.was. moved to, issue his. edict. It is said
that he strode down to the water's edge
with firm tread and determined mien.
When he drew close to the wearers of
the offending costumes he politely
turned his back, and, clearing .. his
throat a couple of times, began:
"Ladles, your costumes \u25a0 are, â ahâ
very alliterative, and you are doubtless
aware of the sensation you are creat
ing, but. they areâ not â well â It's up to
me."
The truth was out at last, and the
Mayor hurried away. Later he issued
an order to the effect that the only
bathing suits allowed on the beach
would be those of non-transparent ma
terial, cut to a proper length.

Continuing. thÂ« fdenonent said that
Captain Bash was in the bedroom with
Mrs. Tag-gurt. She said that Captain
Taggart scolded Ills wife once when
ehe came home with Captain Bash at 2
o'clock in the morningr..
Lee Mohlcr of Orrville testified that
lie had seen Mrs. Taggart going to
dances with '"Billy" Taggart. lie said
th.it/ these dances were held and at
tended by a select crowd.
It. F. Christie of the same place said
that he lived at the Hurd House while
Mrs. Taggart was living there, and saw
her and "Billy" eat together and sev
eral occasions and saw him go upstairs
with her to her room.
Mrs. Peter Evcrly, who lives next
to the house occupied by Mrs. Taggart
In. Orrville. was called and said that
on one occasion she saw Mrs. Taggart
and "Billy" leave the house in the
evening and return to it at about 5
o'clock the next morning. - She fre
quently saw "Billy" bringing quart bot
tles of whisky to the house and after
Mrs. Taggart left the house they hauled
away a barrel of quart whisky bottles.
The deposition .of Augustina de Aa.
Ci "us, taken in Spanish at Manila, was
introduced. She said:
was offered a drink by William Taggart
et Mrs. Grace Taggrart's house and that
he took a drink from, a bottle handed him.
He said that the major and his wife al
ways treated one another courteously.
G. M. Brennenirn of Orrville was asked
&s to "William Tagrearfs reputation for
morality. The defense objected and then
ensued one of the most brilliant legal and
oratorical battles between Judge Smyser
and James Stifling that ever took place
In the Wayne County courthouse. The
battle continued for an hour and a half,
and after a short recess Judge Eason sus
tained the objection.
The deposition of Mrs. J. R. Moore of
San Francisco was then introduced. It
was to the effect that during the time
I'roni 1901 to 1903 she was nurse for Mrs.
Taggart's mother at the Culver home in
Chicago. Clinton Spencer and Bmyser
called at the house quite frequently, and
one evening. Mrs. Taggait becoming ill,
Spencer carried her upstairs to her room
and the witness went along up and lighted
the gas. Mrs. Taggart told her that once,
while in San Francisco, she, another wo
man and two men went slumming. Mrs.
Taggart's description of what she saw
was disgusting in the extreme.
At the afternoon session Mrs. Faren
baugh of Orrville was recalled to the
etand, but was not allowed to testify
,as to the character of William Tag
gart.

able gossip in theatrical circles was
occasioned by the report In the actors'
colony that divorce proceedings were
about to be commenced between Wil
liam Collier and his wife, who Is
known on the stage as Louise Allen.
This talk sprang from a cablegram
from Collier, who is in London, to
Thomas Garrick, foreman of his
country place at St. James, which v read:
"Will pay no debts contracted by~_ my
wife after this date. Notify trades
men."
The cablegram was dated August 3

NEW YORK, Aug. 4.â That a prosecu
tion on a criminal charge other than the
indictment for libel already lodged against
him awaited Robert A. Criswell, editor
of The New Yorker, and editor-in
chief of The Social . Editors', Society,
who leaped or fell under a subway ex
press last night at Seventy-second street
station, was stated to-day at the office of
tho District Attorney. . Criswell's friends
say his mind had become unbalanced
through constant brooding / over ' his ar
rest on July 15, and subsequent troubles
arising from the District Attorney's in
quiry into the Social Editors'^ Society, of
which he was the head. His arrest was
caused by Congressman Joseph L.' Rhi
nock of Covington, Ky., who "charged
criminal libel, because of the publication'
in Criswell's paper "The, New Yorker,"
of an article entitled "An Insult. to Alice.
Roosevelt." ' \u25a0
Assistant District Attorney Paul Krotel
was; very I much surprised "this | morning
when â¢he learned of 4he-. ** &\h of. Criswell.
Latsrirhejsaid':^ v, ;.>.-/...*.,. ': / .
. "Although no criminal action has been
brought against "Criswell, we were seri
ously contemplating bringing a charge
against him for obtaining money under
false pretenses. Every time Criswell was
here at the office he seemed greatly wor
ried-: I believe' he was frightened into
taking â¢hie -own 'life, fearing he was going
to be prosecuted. .
"Upon my j superficial examination of
the books of .'America's Foremost Fami
lies,' which . I conducted last week, they
showed that $6,500 â¢ had . been collected and
none of it had been spent toward publish
ing the book. Practically all of the money
had gone into commissions and salaries to
Criswell and Irving and their two col
lectors, A. de Wald Bloom t and Leo M.
Morris. _ , .
"I requested- Criswell to appear here
last Monday and produce the books of his
concern. He promised to do bo, but I
heard nothing from him."
CINCINNATI, Aug. 4.â The tragic
death of Robert W. Criswell, in New
York last last night, following the
complaint made. against his paper, the
New Yorker, for. a publication involv
ing Congressman Rhinock, of Coving
ton, Ky., Miss. Alice Roosevelt.' Con
gressman Longworth and others, led to
the supposition that It was a, case of
suicide, caused by the results of the
publication. Congressman Rhinock
reached Cincinnati to-day from a brief
absence. He said he was shocked by
the news. ~" .
1 "It probably was suicide," he said,
"but I do not believe the charge I filed
against him prompted the act, for Cris
well knew there, was nothing to fear
In my case, y Affairs that the, public
have not* been informed of, I think,
prompted the deed. As a matter of
fact, I do not believe It is revealing: a
secret now to say that since the publi
cation of his answer to .my complaint
Criswell -had -been summoned to the
District Attorney's office a dozen times
on cases entirely distinct from mine.'
I believe Criswell saw himself help
lessly enmeshed and decided to .end it
all. â¢ -
"I believe Criswell was sincerely
sorry for. the publications He did not
reveal to .me the author of the article,
but promised -.to do so at the hearing
in September, 'if, by that time, the man
did not come'forward himself and ac
knowledge the authorship.
"He was not promised immunity. I
told him I would do what I could for
him If he ". told all, but that did not
mean much, as it' was not my case but
that/ of the District Attorney. ,1 . an

SAN DIEGO, Aug. 4.fâ More than two
score of society people of this city had
a genuine scare "and for a time were' in
actual peril this evening. .They started
to cross the bay in the house boat Lady
Moulton for. the purpdse of attending a
dance at Tent City. At the entrance of
Glorietta Bay, on the Coronado side, the
Lady Moulton went aground. While the
engine was being backed in an effort to
get her atloat again there was an explo
sion of gasoline and the boat took fire.
It was useless to try to fight the names
with water, so wet cushions, blankets
and even coats were used by the men In
the party.
"They succeeded \u25a0in putting out the
fire and then there was a prospect that
all- hands, would -have to remain on the
partly burned -craft the rest of -the
night, for the people on the. shore sup
posed that the boat was anchored and
had no inkling of what, had occurred.
By,, good luck, however, about 11
o'clock i a launch came within hailing
distance and took the. party ashore.

General Superintendent R. H. Ingram
of the Southern Pacific of | an uncon

fined- woman has developed a mystery
which ' involves, according to his own
story, a nephew, of the late Bishop Kip.
According, to Engineer. Johnstone, who
was bringing the special from Sal ton,
where- . Superintendent Ingram \u25a0 and .
party of -.Southern Pacific officials had
been called, it whs by the narrowest: of
margins that; the woman escaped being
ground to death under the -wheels .of
the', train. Superintendent Ingram or
dered the woman to be. placed on board
.and taken to -Yuma. -On the way the
woman; regained consciousness long
enough to exclaim "I want to kiss my
husband; I want -to .kiss my husband."
.Then she relapsed Into unconsciousness.
The^woman had arrived at the South
ern Pacific hotel the . previous evening
*in company with a tail,- athletic and
'well-dressed man, . who registered as
"Mr, and Mrs. Kip, San Diego." In con
versation with: Proprietor Wiggins of
the hotel to-day j Kip claimed that he
was a lawyer and a nephew of Bishop
-Kip of the Episcopal church of Cali
fornia, who died several years ago.
t i It afterward transpired: that the, man
'claiming to be Kip 'had had a violent
quarrel with the woman. \u25a0He was later
located on . an ; Indian Reservation â¢ and

Pflster, one of the wealthiest citizens of
'Milwaukee, was indicted by the Grand
Jury of Milwaukee County to-day,
charged with stealing $14,000 belonging
to the Wisconsin, Rendering Company

OoveruoT BJanchard. telling him of the
action taken.
The announcement of the action tak<?n
at tirsr created some alarm fn the city,
grovrny out of the rear tnai it meant that ;
the eituation had grown ' cntr/ely beyond
control, bu^ ihat alarm wee allayed when
it became Known that rhe authorities had
acttd { sitnjjly in the belief that the
prompt â¢ action now in turning over the j
direction of affairs to the Marine Hos
pital Service, in whom there is supreme
confidence here, would almost certainly
6.vert ; an ' epidemic*. v ' ~~- " i "-"-*\u25a0'â¢â¢-'â¢\u25a0 '
- At a conference at the City Hal! it was
decided that Mayor Bchrman should issue
a proclamation requiring every business j
.house in the city to close its doors on j
Wednesday next in order that , employes
â¢might take a hand in the general clean
ing movement that has been inaugurated, j
Merchants are to be.' asked fo furnish j

WANT PROMPT REPORTS.
The Major decided to borrow an addi
tional JJO.OOO from the fiscal agents to!
assist in tne work. To-day the Board Of !
Health Instituted a new rule requiring j
its inspectors to make prompt report of
c-as-. .c. To that -order was due the*"fact
that twenty cases had been announced 1
â¢early in the afternoon as occurring dur- I
, Ing the day. Yesterday the 3 o'clock re-!
port was of seven new cases and two
% deaths. The announcement at 6 o'cJock
j that there were fifty-four cases and five
* deaths was due to the fact that the in
spectors turned their cases in in Punches
"late in tne evening, and had a most dis
quieting effect on the public, which haÂ«
been led to believe that the situation was
improving. Hundreds of people are tem
porarily moving out of New Orleans Into
St. Tammany Parish. St. Tammany is
practically the only nearby haven to
which local people can go. The parish
has refused to put on a quarantine and
has opened its doors to all refugees. That
*is due to the fact that a case of yellow
lever was never developed there, even in
the most serious epidemics here. Cases
. have been taken into the parish, but whe
ther the patient recovered or died there
has never been any extension of the in
fection. The reason for the Immunity of
St.* Tammany is that the stegomyia has
never existed there.
Because of the rigidity of the quaran
tines instituted by Texas and some of the .
parisfies.tn Louisiana the' Southern Pa
cine' has suspended passenger traffic and
has also refused much of the freight of
fered to it. General Freight Agent Fay,
however. Issued an announcement to-day
thaju beginning on Saturday, the road
â¢wo\jld again receive freight for Texas
points. /r.

CHICAGO. Aug. 4.â Three hours of dis
cussion of life insurance problems by a
committee of the IroquoisClub yesterday
left only one Question in the minds of the
investigators.- It was:* ' \u25a0-'.
. "Is Congress authorized under the pres
enC Federal constitution to enact legisla
tion placing the companies under Fed
eral supervision?"
The possibility of improved State regu
lations is not regarded with so much
hope." /. â¢;â¢-.â¢ :\u25a0; r : *.;. \u25a0 '> -: : ,
A. sub-committee "of four attorneys fwho
have_ made a' study.'of theliffc insurance
laws" was appointed 1 t^looir into .the ques
tions of ccristitutldnajlimitatlons on Con
gressional action and 'to report toj the
regular committee; at the end, of; two
weeks." It is also requested to" investigate
any measures, to -make- more effectual the
supervision of the State superintendents.
'\u25a0 The committee members will confine
their attention' almost entirely to learn
ing if the insurance business may be
classed as interstate commerce and 'thus
come under the jurisdiction of Congres3.
If the decision is reached that the legis
lation required is beyond their authority
measures 'for'- securing a constitutional
amendment will-toe* considered*. j
.There are now two bills for the .Fed
eral regulation <of insurance pending in
Congress, one fathered >by Congressman
Morrell \u25a0 and â¢ the . ether " by Senator Dry
\u25baden.''who suggests . a "comprehensive . sys
tem of control. Neither has 'been acted
upon, and thje question of Federal juris
diction has > been presented to the; Su
preme Court. It is to' the-' support 'of the
latter proposition, that the Iroquois [Club
and its supporters probably will turn.

J Fruitvale grocer. Sheriff tJarnetis con

the youthful trio it fell to deal the blow

:a. confession. ... r* â¢
; Barnet was willing to give

1 f ession. â¢ - â¢ .
fcchuciiier's stcry agrees in air essential

â¢ cares, as does Pembroke, v.at Blaktr
I dealt the blows that caused the deatn of
Cock. "Hie ntcries of Schneider and Per
n, broke are the sam't as to the general
! plarnine of tho bo.d-up. Schneider, in ad
: (iltioa, says that the trio watched Cook
jail during that Saturday night until he
j left the store. Then they followed-him
j until ihty get- to the dark place in the
road mÂ»ar Fiujtvale avenue. Schneider
| claims ;hat he and Pembroke were a little
I behind HlaUer when ..ie latter struck the
j llcw that ieÂ«:ea Cook to the. ground. He
! agrees that Pembroke ran, and says that
< while be stocd by he did not rob Cook.
j Bcficeidcr declares that he did not get any
(of the money. ( . - â¢ "
! Pembroke 4nd Schneider have shielded
: themselves as much as possible in the
j confessions.
SAYS HE GOT XO MO.XEV.
As to the money taken from Cook, both
I Schneider and Pembroke are very posl
! tive tliat neither obtained any. Schneider,
; Jn his story to-day, denied that he got
j any of the coin. at the time, though he
| admits that Blaker paid his expenses en
I the Sunday following the hold-up when
j they -.vent to the Chutes and around San
! Francisco.
Blaker_is the only one who has said
I nothing. H!s father has employed A. JL.
: Frick to look after his case, and, acting
i upon tho advice of his attorney, the boy
| refuses to talk. â¢ â¢
The murder of Cook and the arrest of
', th(s gang of ycting criminals has ended
i the reign of terror in Fruitvale. The
j youthful desperadoes had planned a series
of hold-ups. Had the Cook robbery been
accomplished, without detection, a long
iist of East Oakland and Fruitvale citi
zens would have been stood up, for they
were marked for future operations by the
gang.
Mll.l.Cn MARKED BY GAXC.
.Thr man who was marked for the next
hold-up was James Jiilkr, the East Oak
land pottery man. who lives on Twenty
! lifth avenue. . Miller â¢ is " a man â¢ who -is
known aYound East Oakland as always
carrying n considerable amount of money
with him. He Is also the possessor of a
large number of very fine diamonds which
j h<? wears nearly all of the time. With
I a set of three very fine shirt .studs and
several rings. Mr. Miller has at least $1500
north of 6tones thai could easily be njade
salable "by simply lenocking them but of"
the settings. Thr "Jim Crow" gang knew
" this, and it had marked Miller for its
next victim.
The fact that the gang had picked other
victims would indicate that Cook mu>t
: have eithor made a fight .that caused
j th^m tv beat him into insensibility, pr
I that, in their excitement, they, struck
I harder than they thought. : . j
The funeral of Thomas \V. Cook took
j phice to-day fcom his home on Fruit
| vale- avenue. The services wore very
1 simple and were conducted by the Rev.
j Robert Whitaker of . the Twenty-third
Avenue Church. The services Were very
quiet and were attended only by the fam
ily. Friends were asked not to send
flowers.

SEATTLE, Aug. 4.â Misfortune still
continues to follow the Robare family
in .Seattle. Each member has been In
jured one or more times by accidents
and has many times sued the corpora
tions alleged to have been responsible.
Now Miss Gertrude Robare, 23 years
old, Is the proscuting witness against
Jesse Miracle, a Seattle real, estate
man, who, she alleges, betrayed her
after taking her through a mock mar
riage ceremony, and then secured near
ly $1000 that had been awarded to her
In damages against the Seattle and
Renton railroad. .i^: r
The girl says she met Miracle, who
claimed he loved her and asked her to
be Ms wife. Miracle lived but a short
distance from the Robare home and
called there often. When Miracle
asked Miss Robare to.be his wife, she
consented. At his request the mar
riage was to be kept very quiet. A few
days prior to. June 13. the girl alleges
that Miracle took her to the home of
a relative, where she went through a
ceremony believed by her to be a legal
marriage. , Later she says she learned
the marriage was only a mockery. In
the meantime, she says, Miracle had se
cured her money and when he had gone
through with about all of it she dis
covered that she was not his legal wife.
The facts came out when Miss Robare
learned that Miracle was engaged to
marry another girl. -
EUREKA. Aug. 4.â The wrecked
steamship Tricolor, which went ashore
on the MendocJno coast ten days ago.
Is proving, a rich harvest for wreck
ers, and material worth thousands of
dollars has been landed at the port of
Eureka every day. The principal ones
to benefit are longshoremen. The .slop
chest-has been rifled of several thou
sands of dollars' worth of clothes. The
brass fittings of the steamship hava
been taken, as well as all the. lines of
ropes and a portion of the machinery.
Underwriters have not yet abandoned
the vessel, and complications will arise
over tho thefts. Several persons have
viewed the wreck with the idea of pur-,
chasinsr from the underwriters, atnons
them Henry Rogers, who has Just re-,
turned to San Francisco. It was stated
that he would make a bid. but unless
speedy action is taken there 'will ba
nothing left to sell but the hull of tho '
vessel, which Is valueless, owing: to
the fact that it cannot be approached \
save by small boats.
The Tricolor has shifted her position;'
and now lies \u25a0 with her bow pointing
to the shore. There are still no signs
of its breaking up. The Interior of tho
vessel has not even been moistened with â¢
water.

has doubted that Russia was entering
the conference in good faith, and has
asserted frequently that Russia is
trying to force Japnn to show its hand
to gain the advantage of an armistice
or secure a diplomatic advantage which
will deprive Japan of the fruits of its
victories. It is now pointed out that
Russia, in various ways, is endeavoring
to minimize the effect of the Japanese
victories so as to enter the conference
not as a beaten power, but upon' an
equal footing with Japan.
The near approach of the meeting of
the plenipotentiaries is again centering
popular attention on the question of the
terms of ponre. Public sentiment seems
permeated with a grim determination
to secure conditions regarded as com
mensurate with Japanese successes ana

DX WITTE AT OYSTER BAY.
President and Mrs. Roosevelt to-day
Informally entertained Sergius de Witte
and Baron Rosen. The distinguished vis
| itors arrived in Oyster Bay at 12:30
I o'clock from New York. A number ot
residents of Oyster Bay had assembled at
the station to see the Russian envoys.
As they alighted from the train they
were confronted by a battery of cameras
backed by a lot of enterprising: photogra
phers. Baron Rosen waved them aside,
indicating evident displeasure. The en
voys were met by messengers from the
President's official household, and escort
ed by the officers were directed to a car
riage which the President had cent to the
station to convey them to Sagamore Hill.
Neither Mr. de Witte nor Baron Rosen
would make any comment upon their vis
it. They entered the carriage in waiting
and with Secret Service Operative Burns
on the front seat were driven rapidly to
the President's home in tilde for lunch
eon. President Roosevelt gave Mr. de
Witte, who was presented to him by Em
bassador Rosen, a most cordial welcome,
and they chatted informally and ani
matedly before the luncheon was an
nounced.
Soon after arriving at Sagamore Hill
Baron Rosen conveyed to the President a
vigorous protest against the actions of
some of the photographers at the railroad
station. He did not conceal his annoy
ance at their strenuous efforts to obtain
pictures. The President called two secret
service officers and gave directions that
the annoyance his guests had been sub
jected to on their arrival should be avert
ed if possible when thry returned to take
their train for New York. While some
pictures were taken at the station on
their return, the envoys were subjected
to no jostling or Inconvenience.
It was the desire of Mr. <le Witte to
pay his respects to President Roosevelt
before the formal reception of the en
voys to-morrow. That his visit was
of some significance is, perhaps, beyond
doubt, but positive assurance is given
that it did .not differ' materially from
that of Baron Komura last week.

control of such far extended lines,
which are unprecedented in the history

peace negotiations, will be on such a
gigantic scale as to decide the war
once and for all.

JAPANESE
AND SLAV
TO MEET
Congressman C. F. Cochran of St. Jos
eph, Mo., who is among the stanchest
friends of William Jennings Bryan, and
who is also prominently identified in his
native State as a lawyer and newspa
per editor, arrived .-here yesterday on
his way- to" Portland and is staying at
the Palace. Hotel.
\u25a0The Congressman has come "West In
connection with a case that has aroused
widespread interest in. Missouri, in
volving the distribution of an estate
valued variously between $6,000,000 and
$15,000,000 and which contains material
that would form- the foundation for. an
interesting" ! novel.' The Burns family
was \u25a0 one. of the most prominent and
wealthy in Northern. Missouri, and its
heads, three brothers, who all figured
conspicuously in the business and po
litical" history of the State, having
passed away, their surviving relatives
are now. undergoing the usual litigious
experience of heirs to large estates.
The contest, in which Congressman
Cochran is acting in a legal capacity,
grows out of an attempt through the
courts of Missouri to, lmmure one of
the Burns family â a woman of middle
age â on the. ground that, as she was
never given an education, she Is an in
competent person and cor.seauently not
entitled to receive the vast fortune that
has iinally passed to her control by the
death of her father and mother.
. PROVES BRILLIANT WOMAN.
Although this woman is 40 years of
age, deformities from childbirth have
practically kept hep 1 in seclusion for
the better part of the thirty-two years
she has lived in St. Joseph. , Few of
even the most intimate acquaintances
of the Burns family have ever seen the
woman except while she was out rid
ing or at a distance in the theaters of
St. Joseph, of which she has been " a
regular patron. Her deformities, one
of which is 'an affliction of the eyes,
rendered It impossible to give the wom
an an education in an ordinary way,
but a devoted mother, by constant con
tact with her child, to .whom she read
and discussed all matters of possible In
terest, furnished the unfortunate daugh
ter with ample material for mental di
gestion and eventually elevated the lat
ter's mind to a realm of intelligence
where she acquired a degree of bril
liancy in literature and drama that has
been pronounced most remarkable.
As the daughter of Calvin F. Burns,
who died in Missouri in 1896, Miss
Burns inherited a fortune that had been
accumulated by her father partly
through a conveyance of interests from
his two brothers, who had died before
him. This conveyance had excluded sev
eral others who were closely related to
the Burns family, but who had never
come in contact with the direct heirs. .
RELATIVES WANT FORTUNE.
- The disinherited relatives have now
brought an action to determine the san
ity of Miss Burns, and., if . possible! se-"
cure a share of the estate. The pro
ceedings in the matter have already
established the fact that, notwithstand
ing that Miss Burns* afflictions prevent
ed her from ever learning to read or
write, she has acquired, through the
assistance of her mother, now dead, a
remarkable knowledge of the best lit
erature, had well informed herself on
the drama and absorbed much informa
tion concerning current fashions and
other matters interesting to women,
and on these subjects she has since
proved herself a wonderfully interest
ing critic.
It was these surprising facts that
Congressman Cochran, the legal adviser
of Miss Burns, lias succreded in bring
ing to light in St. Joseph, where the
public has been closely watching the
remarkable case. The presence of the
Congressman on the coast' at this
time is for the purpose of getting the
testimony of a number of relatives of
Miss Burns, who arc interested jln the
action now pending in St. Joseph.
TOKIO, Aug. 4. â It is reported that
the advance guards of the hostile forces
south of the Turaen River are within
rifle range of one another. An early
conflict is regarded as .inevitable.
A report giving details of the final
pursuit and surrender of the majority
of the Russian garrison on Saghalien
Island has been received as follows:
"An independent cavalry .column on
the afternoon of July 28 attacked the
enemy south of Paleo and routed him.
drivin ghim ' southward and capturing
two field guns, besides a- number of
rifles and a Quantity of ammunition. >
'â¢On July 29 the cavalry, being rein
forced, vigorously pursued the enemy
south of Taylan, which lies twenty
flve miles south of Rykoff. The enemy
halted at Onol, twenty-five miles south
of Taylan, and at 5 o'clock on: the
j morning of July 30 sent a letter under
ja flag of,- truce to the Japanese com
| manding. officer from General Llapnoff,
the Russian Governor, saying that the
lack of bandage material and medicines
;md the consequent inability to succor
the wounded compelled him,- from a
sense of humanity, to terminate hos
tilities.
'"The commander of the Japanese
I force replied, demanding the delivery of
j all war supplies and property of the
I Russian Government uninjured and the
delivery of all maps, records and papers
relating to the Russian civil and mili
tary administration, and requiring their
delivery in reply at 10 o'clock, on the
morning of July 31; otherwise an at
tacking movement would immediately
be executed.
- "Colonel Tolivitch, on behalf of Gov
ernor Liapnoff, met Colonel Koizumi,
Japanese chief of staff, on the morning
of July 31 and accepted the proposed
terms.
"Governor Liapnoff, seventy officers
and ui'oo men of the Russian garrison
then surrendered.
"The spoils, consisting of clothing,
papers and military supplies, are now.
under investigation."
GODZY, Manchuria, Aug. 4. â Dis
patches received from Korea, report
that the Japanese have begun a simul
taneous advance from Kwanchoda
against the Russians, but that the north
columns were checked under pressure
of the Russian advance detachment.
The Russian losses, the dispatches say,
were insignificant.
Japanese warships are reported to be
cruising off the mouth of Peter the
Great Bay, on which Vladivostok is
situated, their lights often being visible
from the Russian island.
Chinese arriving from the south say
that, the Japanese are most active in
establishing trade relations in South
ern Manchuria; that more than a score
of large business houses have been,es
tablished at Yinkow and 5000
Japanese sutlers and larger traders fol
low the army.
Almost tropical rains are falling in
Manchuria and the hilly regions are
Impassable for trains of artillery. Ev
ery mountain path is a torrent and
every valley a quagmire. Important
operations apparently will be impos
sible for a long time. The alternation
of rains and sunshine has a depressing
effect on the health of the army. j

"SERGIUS DE WITTE."
NEW YORK, Aug. 4. â After his return from Oyster Bay to-day, Sergius de Witte gave out the
following statement â¢ -i
"I enjoyed my visit so much! I knew that I should meet an energetic man. He impressed me,
first, by his warm handclasp. There was no mistaking the , cordiality of his welcome. He was friendly
and so admirable that I knew why he was elected President of these many States. About his presence
there exudes a charm which is unmistakable.
"Throughout my conversation with him, I was impressed by the profound knowledge he has of
foreign events, the manner in which he was able to absorb information, the great care he. takes to make one
feel at home and how he is so democratic and sincere. ;- '
"I have always admired the President of the United States. His active life is not new to me. I
have read much of him. I wanted to shake his hard, and, when I did so, I felt his friendliness. No one
can deny he is one of the foremost statesmen of the world and I came away from his home at Oyster Bay
convinced that in his hands the reins of government will always be firmly grasped.

The vessel rose to a height of about
10W feet and diced around for the

then rose to an elevation of 3000 feet
and started northward In the face ot a
stiff breeze. The wind appeared to have
little influence on the progress of the
"Angelus." Ten minutes later the pro

the airship was carried rapidly with
the wind. Boechey deflated the gas
bag, and made a descent a few minutes
later about three miles down the Wil

was towed to the fair grounds by a

stall a new motor. He expects to have
the airship ready for another flight on

to both companies, the Southern Pacific having

It Is generally believed that the trou
ble over trackage privileges in Southern
California Is not yet at an end. The
Santa Fe. as a competitor of the South
ern Pacific Company, which refused to
grant it trackage privileges In the
southern territory, may call upon Traf
fic Director Stubbs for an explanation
of the granting of privileges to another

the Santa Fe road, and a failure to re

The Rev. Father P. J. Cummins, pas
tor of St_ Patrick's Church, has been
appointed by Archbishop Riordan to
the Irremovable rectorship of Mission
Dolores in succession to the late Father
Brennan, who recently passed away.
On the death of the late Father Scan
lan while in New York on his way to
his birthplace in Ireland, Fathef Cum
mins was created a chancellor, an ap
pointment of much importance. Father
Cummins is one of the best kjjown
priests in the city. He is untiring In
his labors and ever foremost In assist
ing In all matters relating to the char
ities of the Catholfc church. He has in
San Francisco and. indeed, wherever he
re known, a wide circle of friends.
His denunciation cf the Esch-Town
send bill giving the Interstate Com
merce Commission the power to fix
rates was combated by A. B. Nye, pri
vate secretary 6f Governor Pardee, who
was an Interested spectator. Nye con
tended, that the proprsed bill gave no
greater power than the California Rail
road Commission possessed and no bad
results had accrued, lye held that the
bill was necessary because the consoli
dating of railroad interests had prac
tically killed competition.
â¢In speaking of the future of the
North Shore Railroad, he said that while
this year's statement showed a deficit
of $185,030 52, the road had a great
future, as it was rapidly building up
the locality through which it travels.
He said that this country was becom
ing such a favorite camping ground in
summer that the principal freight con
sisted of canned sardines and beer. He
said that at the present time the man
agement of the road was a hard grind
and during the past year not one of
tho principal officers of the road had
taken a cent of salary.
Mellersh said the steam roads of the
country were badly handicapped by
the electric system and within fifty
years all steam locomotives would be
superseded by electricity and gasoline.
He predicted that when the roads to
the East were double-tracked and laid
with heavy rails it would be possible
to go to New York in three days.
SACRAMENTO, Aug. 4. â Thomas Mel

valuations. In ans\wr to questions, ho
said that the road had a good future
and would bo extended as rapidly as
possible into tho Humbolilt country. It
would cost several f. mill ion s of dollars
to reach the timber belt, but eventually
it would pay handsomely. He said that
one merchant In Eureka had a stand
ing offer to pay $30,000 for the first
railroad ticket from that city to San
Francisco. He said It was estimated
that if .one hundred carloads of lumber
a day were taken out of that country
annually during the next one hundred
years hardly any Impression would be
made on the supply.

Assembly from this county, and a grand
nephew of the late George Kohl, an eccen
trio miser, is contesting the distribution
of hia uncle's estate. Hartmann claims
the estate was left in trust to F. A.
Hihn, a landowner and millionaire of this
county, with the understanding that after
all Kohl's debts and funeral expenses
were paid the balance should go to
Schultheiss, the Burgomaster of the vil
lage of Rechtenbach in Bavaria, in trust
for the poor of the village where Kohl
was born. He claims that Hihn has not
fulfilled the terms of the trust, which. It
is admitted, was left out of the will at
Hihn's suggestion on account- of legal
technicalities, Hihn promising to execute
the old man's wishes. Kohl sent for Hihn
on his sick bed, it is said, and had tho
millionaire write his wll. The will was
written in July, 1901, and Kohl died the
following March. Hartmann declares
Hihn admitted he was only a' trustee and
claims he has taken no steps to wind up
the estate or to send the money to the
Burgomaster of Rechtenbach. The peti
tion asks that F. A. Hihn be declared a
trustee under the will for the poor of
Rechtenbach, that Hartmann be declared
the only heir at law and that two-thirds
of the estate be set apart for himself and
a third for the Rechtenbach poor.
The estate consists of valuable real es
tate in this city and about $3000 in cuth
In the bank. Hartmann worked for his
uncle for some years, during which, lie
says, the old man, in a fit of anger, shot
at him with a twenty-two-caiiber rifle,
several shots taking effect In his foot.

The friends of Professor Julius Goebel,
until recently .the head of -the department
of Germanic languages* at Stanford Uni
versity, were considerably disturbed yes
terday when they learned of the disposi
tion made of his appeal to the trustees of
the university from the action of. Presi
dent Jordan, dismissing him. The trustees
take the stand that President Jordan's
decision is final in such matters, and. they
refuse to further consider the case.
, As a mark of appreciation of Professor
Goebel's past services In the University,
the trustees, at their meeting, voted him
a year's salary. The latter was not pres
ent at the meeting but was officially ad
vised by letter of the disposal of his case.
When his attorney was asked if the- pro
fessor would carry the matter to the
State courts he replied that he was not
prepared to say what action his client
would take.

The McGowan-Keane ticket of the
Forty-second District, which was
thrown into the field In opposition to
that of the San Francisco Republican
League, held a rally at Saratoga Hall,
Geary street near Larkln, last evening.
The politics . put up at the rally was
of the most strenuous sort and included
everything from foaming beverages to
a three-round boxing - match. .The
Wolfe brothers hammered each other
In a manner that won double the ap
plause offered to any . of the speakers.
And then there were "coon-song shout
ers," balladists and rag-time pianists
by the dozen. '
Attorney George A. McGowan, who
is leading the fight in the district
against the Republican League, made
the first address, in which he called
for the support of the gathering. For
mer Chief Deputy County Clerk Joseph
Goddard' followed McGowan. Forget
ting that clean streets are more at Is
sue in the present campaign than the
tariff or \u25a0 other questions of national
import, Goddard made a "full dinner
pail" speech,, in which he ran the gamut
of the higher, issues from the soup
house to imperialism.
James Cosgrove, who was ; in the
chair, , made the closing remarks.

The Board of Park Commissioners met
yesterday at the Palace Hotel, Reuben H.
Lloyd in . the chair. The Commissioners
present were Reuben H. Lloyd, William"
J. . Dlngee, Earl Cummlngs and Superin
tendent John McLaren. â¢ â¢ ;'
Some half dozen physicians petitioned
that at "least one avenue be open for the
convenience of automoblksts after 11
o'clock at> night, urging the use of vthe
automobile as the accepted expeditious
manner of answering urgent calls.
. The board listened to the representa
tives of two firms In the auto industry
who also favored the opening of the park
at all times for the automobile. The
board decided to temporarily allow the
use of the auto on the South drive at all
: hours, .but with the concession came the
warning against. fast driving or boisterous
behavior.
Secretary Schmitz later read a com
munication from the Oceanslde Improve
ment Club expressing "deep appreciation
for. the wisdom and courage of the board
in limiting the time within which carous
ing and drunken automobile parties may
be within . the park." Lloyd expressed
surprise that the communication had not
been read : before the board rendered Its
decision. , "
Superintendent McLaren announced that
366 men - and women had been employed
in the park and squares during the month
and that Lloyd Lake, situated at the east
end of the old speedway road, had been
completed and would contain . 6,ooo,ooo gal-.
lons of water for Irrigating " purposes.
Golden- Gato I Valley .Improvement Club
thanked the ( board for Improving Loboa
avenue square. An offer iof the .Colonial
Dames to present j the park with a hand
some sun dial was favorably received
and left In the | hands of Commissioner
Cummlngs. The plan and sketch of the
new windmill for the south- western part
of the park were adopted. The windmill
is the i gift of 'â¢ Samuel G. Murphy, .who
donated â¢ J20.000 with whidh to build it.
\u0084-" Lloyd understood that "hoodlums'.' had
been depriving children of their play
things In the park and he wished it un
derstood that that kind of business would
not '\u25a0\u25a0 be tolerated. > The Epworth League
petitioned that, .drinking fountains be
placed, along.the ocean boulevard. The
matter was favorably received and left in
the hands of Superintendent McLaren,
A rousing meeting of the Republican
League Club in.the Thirty-seventh As
sembly District was held in Phelps*
Hall, 317 Devlsadero street, last night.
The hall was crowded and the utmost
enthusiasm prevailed. The chair was
occupied by W. J. Ruddock, who ex
plained the highly commendable meth
od adopted in the selection of the dele
gates. It was not the intention of the
club, he said, to criticize others and in
dulge in mud-slinging, but the purpose
was to see that men were selected for
office who would work for the Interests
of the people. He predicted success at
the primary election."
M. J.Kuhl was the first speaker. He
said the city had acquired a reputation
within the past few years which was
not enviable. Class hatred had been
engendered and everything done to
paralyze industrial interests. Every in
telligent citizen knew as much , about
the Mayor as himself and what he had
done to pit labor against capital. The
true cause of the present unfortunate
position of the city was the indifference
of the individual citizen who refuses
to participate In the vital administra
tive affairs of the municipality.
Rousing speeches were also delivered
by C. B. Perkins, , Assemblyman Fred
C. Jones, James Field, George Hewlett;
George D. Clark, Joseph G. de Forest,
Dr. R. E. Hartley, and others for the
success of the ticket at the primary
election.

Officer F. W. Nobman of the Southern
Station was fined $25 for being intoxicated
while on duty. The evidence In the case
was conclusive as to, his guilt, but many
testimonials of his previous good record
were brought to bear, so the fine' was
made comparatively light. Lieutenant
Conboy made a recommendation that
leniency be shown the policeman because
of his long service and' because he has
never -been before the Commissioners on
a charge.
| David S. Sullivan was re-Instated on the
police, force last night by a unanimous
vote of the Commission, as it was proven
that he was not guilty of the Â» charge for
which he was dismissed. Sullivan was
released from the department January 20,
1903, on a charge of drinking In a saloon
with women while on duty. . F. O. Con
nell, who was â¢ released on the same
charge, was re-Instated long ago, as It
was proved In his case '\u25a0 that they were
both in the discharge of their duty while
in the saloon.
Resolved. That the Chief of Police be and is
hereby authorized- and directed- to instruct all

"Municipal Patriotism" was the sub
ject of an address delivered lasjt night
by Rev. William Rader before a large
meeting of the British and American
Union in the Academy of Sciences Hall.
He spoke in part as follows:
The official who administers the city for his
own interest is a political criminal.
1. appeal to theJ / !y T aUve Sons. They, should
take a thoughtful interest in the municipal
welfare of the city. I appeal to the men who
have come from other lands and States. Men
lruin all lands and cities are here. I ask you
to assume responsibility. Take hold and help.
li San Francisco is good enough to make a liv
ing in it la good enough to vote In.
I appeal to the indifferent classes, to the
business men. who, as Lincoln Steffens says,
"are buying boodlers. in' St. Louis, defending
gratters in Minneapolis, originating corruption
in Pittsburg, sharing with bosses- in Philadel
phia, deploring reform in Chicago and beating
eood government with corruption funds in
New York." The business men who are too
busy to vote and to attend the primaries have
no right to complain alter the election Is held.
To the church people preachers, professional
men. I say the future "of this city is In your
hands. Wake uÂ»'. \u25a0
The labor unions of San Francisco are in
politics. They have been, in for several years.
They enjoy It. They are the masters of thÂ«
situation. They have a right to go into poli
tics. The worklngman's vote is as heavy as
the employer's vote. This is a free country.
The worklngmen are happier industrially than
.politically. They are receiving good wages j
and are financially prosperous, but they are
uncertain as to the future.
The average laborer is patriotic. He is
thoughtful and I appeal to this thoughtfulness
when I say that it is unfortunate for all when
a separate party Is made out of unionism In
this city at this time. The government of this ;
city Is not intended for any one class, since
the Interest of all is Identical. The civic gov
ernment is not for the people south of Mar
ket, nor north of Market street, not for the
saloonist or the ministers, not for the Catholics
or the Protestants, but for aJI. The people are
the city. Laboring men must collect under
one of two banners, under the banner of de
mocracy or of graft. Labor Is patriotic. La
bor believes in government. Now comes the
judgment of labor.

pression among members of the Mer
chants' Exchange.^ Some .days may be
irequlred for . Minister Rockhill to look
into the facts at Peking and possibly to
gather Information from other . Chinese
points. At Peking It can be learned
whether the boycott has official sanction.
This has been denied. Merchants wish to
know the exact fact, in this regard.
'At various commercial ports In China
action on the part of Chinese guilds has
been reported in tne": v direction of dis
crimination against 'American products.
The American. consuls at these ports can
be called 'on to furnish to Minister Rock
b ill fall the , information they are able to
gather. Then a better, understanding of
the entire matter, can be had by the com-,
mercial people who are interested in ex
porting, to the Orient. . '..
It; was reported yesterday by E.'.R,
Lilienthal of the Merchants'. Exchange
that not . only . orders to . buy American
goods have been revoked but that also
contracts for the future have been set
aside. . Mr. Lilienthal said that the meet

afternoon. All commercial bodies in the
city will be invited to . send representa

to attend who are interested.
President Roosevelt has -been, requested
by business men of 'San 'Francisco to in
struct Mr. X Rockhlll, American . Minister
to China, to investigate and report all the
facts relating to ; the boycott of Ameri
can products by guilds in China. '
A telegram has. been sent* to the Presi

tlic Dealers Some Concern
The San Francisco Republican League,
standing for "A Clean City, Clean Poli
tics and a Clean Administration,", has
organized the forces cf good citizenship
in every district of the city and expects
to achieve success at the primary elec
tion next Tuesday.
The victory will be sweeping and de
cisive if the spirit of civic patriotism shall
be thoroughly awakened. The league has
done everything within the limit of
reasonable enterprise to organize for the
campaign, and it now remains for the
voters to go to the polls and vote the
ticket of the organization.
If the citizens of this city have had
enough of Schmitz and Ruef, they will
. come out and vote next Tueteday. If they
are satisfied with municipal government
as Ruef and Schmitz administer it, they
will loiter at home or spend the day at
some seaside resort or shady glen.
The Republican League can do no more
than has been done to Bring about the
opportunity to redeem the city from the
reign of graft. It Is up to the men of
San Francisco to say what kind of gov
ernment the city shall henceforth have.
When voters excuse themselves from tak
ing the trouble to vote on the plea that
oVher citizens in sufficient number to
carry the day will attend the election,
they Identify themselves with the skulk
ers.
George D. Clark (president), Daniel A.
Ryan (secretary), Fairfax H. Wheelan,
John D. Daly, David Rich, John Lack
mann, Richard J. Welch and E. J. Bowes,
of the executive committee of the league,
have given their time and energies to the
work of organizing the forces of good
government and they ask that citizens
who are now in the country on vacation
to return to the city and vote at the
primary election next Tuesday.
Proof can be produced that A. Ruef,
who is posing as the champion of union
labor, did not stipulate that Japanese
fc'nd Chinese labor should not be employ
td in fbe work of distributing his cam
â¢ i>aign literature, and proof can be pro
ciuced that Japanese were so employed.
The San Francisco Republican League,
mindful of the interests of white work
ing men and women, stipulated against the
employment of Asiatics.
The following affidavits were made yes
terday:

Francisco â es.

FAVORABLE ANSWER \
IS EXPECTED SOON
A visit was paid to the. various wards,
where the desired men were stationed,
and in - every case but one the men
claimed to have registered on the request
tff "some one," although they did' not
call the place their residence. Every pa
tient called upon said that he would leave
the place as soon as his condition war
ranted it. In the, cases where the men
were paid for the work it was held by
Attorney Harris that they were not resi
dents when they intended to remove
upon the expiration of their illness. All
through the list the men were found to
be inmates through sickness, .which fact,
according to ; the law, makes them â¢ in
competent to vote. ."-
The following men were examined by
Foreman Andrews and Attorney Harris,
each of them having registered during the
last month with the, 'ntentibn of voting:
Joseph Bresa, ', 1865 Broadway, is
a patient. He "works In one of the wards,
although he does not claim the place tie
a permanent residence,, therefore,: he is
incompetent. ,
W. H. Devlin, patient, is from the city.
He said he was asked to register by
"some one." He â¢ said he would leave
the^ hospital when he recovered. He has
no right to vote.
l A^. B. Conroy, patient. Is from the Bo
nanza House, and' has been at the \u25a0 Insti
tution only a short time.- ; He intends to
vote, although he is going to leave when
he recovers. â¢ ' : "
Robert Gibson, v patlent, from the city,
declared himself an- "unpaid, permanent
resident, with . the intention of leaving."
He is' thought to be, disqualified. ; .
' Michael Kelleher, patient on the pay
roll, registered and began to . receive pay
during July. Although not a permanent
resident, he intends to vote.
.Pat Shea, 'patient, has voted for Beveral
: years, although not a permanent resident
because ha will leave the hospital .when
well and does notj.call it his home. He
is paid for : working.
John McAulif. patient, claims the right
to vote, although Â»he is not a permanent
resident. â¢ â¢ . .
W. Hayes, patient, works In- the build
ing but. receives no pay and claims the
city for a residence. ..
W." Fitzgerald, patient,- Is not on the
payroll and Is not a permanent resident,
yet intends to vote.
J. M. Harris, patient, receives "' $5 \u25a0 a
month,- but is Ineligible because of his
residence being : in the city.
NO RIGHT TO VOTE.
"Because the men are able to; walk
around does not entitle them to vote,"
said Attorney Harris, "and because some
others are more fortunate in being put
on the payroll a discrimination cannot
be made in their favor.; These men have
no legal right to cast a ballot Win the
true sense of the word -and will ,be pre
vented." \u25a0
Twenty-five indigents were declared In
competent to vote, after ; the Investigation
at the- Almshouse by Foreman Andrews
and Expert Young of the. Grand' Jury
yesterday morning. It has been the cus-'
torn; to vote these men notwithstanding
that the . only > time they are â¢ not in v con
finement is when -they come out to reg
ister or.' vote. ' They are |in â¢' confinement
aa though . in prison and are governed
by the ; same laws, 'which ; makes their
right 'to 'vote 'null. \u0084 ,â¢
* The condition of affairs will be reported
to the Grland Jury and \ decided ' by; them
whether the, indigents' may, vote! If ; they
are not "eligible they^ will: bet challenged
by representatives of ; : the Grand Jury/ at
the .polls.' It was learned that family
pride made ? some of the; Almshouse : in
mates give \u25a0 a fictitious name on registra
tion. Each â¢of "these cases was exam
ined. ,"\u25a0''\u25a0'\u25a0 _;'- *.''. T ." :-'^'.-_ ;.\u25a0'.-
WARDS ARE VISITED.
"These patients have no? right what
ever, to vote," declared Foreman An
drews of the Grand Jury yesterday after
an exhaustive examination of two score
of the registrations of inmates of the
City and County Hospital. ."And if they
do so there will be some lively prosecu
tion for, fraud," he added. ~ x
During \u25a0 the investigation It developed
that a large number of the men had been
put on the hospital payroll and that they
had registered, although they j had not
lost their distinction of being patients.
Many of them are being treated for dis
ease, and since the law reads that a pa
tient is not a permanent resident .of a
hospital about seventy- four men- are un
questionably not entitled to vote. ','
\ To-day at 10 o'clock the report of Fore
man Andrews will be" handed" to the
Grand Jury, and It will undoubtedly take
steps to check the bold scheme to stuff
the ballot-box. /
As a result of the instructions of Dr.
Ward, president of the Health Board,
Superintendent McQuide showed none of
the hostile spirit yesterday which ho : dis
played Wednesday, when he refused to
allow Foreman Andrews to examine the
patients. He explained that at that time
he. was ; only, delaying the' investigation
because of his own stubbornness, and
imagined that, being superintendent, he
could dictate to the Grand' Jury. He as
serted on Wednesday that he would stall
the examination till the last, but; yes
terday he was In a most accommodating
mood. \u25a0
Foreman Andrews and Assistant Dis
trict Attorney Harris were not stopped
at the gates and told to vamos, as- had
been promised. Instead they met Mc-
Quaide in his ofllee and then called for
certain men to appear, and be examined.
The wily superintendent was slightly ruf
fled at first at the instructions sent him
by. Dr. Ward to show the inquisitors
every courtesy, but he tried to relieve his
feelings by telling bluntly that he handed
Andrews "a pretty brick" on Wednesday.
"If you had any sense, *â¢- Harris," you
would have seen that my actions Wednes
day were only a bluff," said McQualde.
"I knew that I had the cinch on you and
told you only what I- chose. ",.y
"Wait till you see what we do to-day,"
said Andnews, "and then you can Judge
whether' we were bluffed out Wednes
day;"

OAKLAND, Aug. 4. â An ordinance
has been ordered prepared by the City
Attorney covering new regulations for
the disposal of the city's garbage. The
Pacific Incinerating Company will be
held to Its original contract, but the col
lection of garbage will be arranged so
that it will not be a monopoly. Sani
tary restrictions will be enforced. This
move, made in accordance with Mayor
Mott's recent special message to the
City Council, will solve, It is expected,
the existing difficulties as to gathering
of the city's waste. Final decision was

BERKELEY. Aug. 4.â Condemnation
of the school board's decision to strictly
enforce the rule requiring the payment
of tuition fees by all fathers who are
not registered voters of Berkeley was
expressed at a special meeting of the
Berkeley Real Estate Dealers' Ex
change, held this afternoon In the of
fices of Juster & Baird. . The realty men
believe that the enforcement of the
rule, in all cases, will work a hardship
upon many persons, and repel from
Berkeley citizens who would otherwise
retain residence in the college town' and
co'ntrlbute to Its prosperity.
The tuition fee "required of high
school pupils, whose fathers are "not
registered In Berkeley, is $50 annually
for each pupil. About 75 pupils are
affected. Many of these are said to
reside here with their parents, even
though the fathers of euch pupils are
not actually registered here..

SAN RAFAEU Aug. 4.â Edtfard D.
Ryan, .the convict, was before Judge
Lennon of the Superior Court on a "writ
of habeas corpus to-day and hisr release
from prison wasi ordered. Ryan, whoaÂ©
time with credits for good behavior would
have expired on August 2. was alleged to
hav*e been detected in taking into San'
Quentln prison a very small pill of opium.
He was brought to San Rafael for a pre
liminary examination. At the trial it was
brought out that Ryan had a good record
as a prisoner previous to the opium inci
dent. He had never given ithe officials
any trouble and waa a trusted prisoner.
He was employed as gardener at one of
the officers* homes and gave satisfaction.
It was show!i that he could have been â¢â¢
easily the victim of some designing con
vict enemy, *who could -have placed the
drug In his garments unknown to him,
as he was In a cell which contained thir
ty-nine prisoners. Judge Magee refused
to hold Ryan a*nd ordered his dismissal.
He was taken back to the State prison
and Warden Tompkin3 filed a complaint
with the of Prison Directors, al
leging that Ryan was guilty of smug
gling. The board met at Folsom on July
22 and considered the Warden's commu
nication, although Ryan was not present,
represented or given an opportunity to
make his defense. They ordered Warden
Tompkins to deprive him of all his cred
its, which he did.
When August 2 came and Ryan was riot
released his attorney, James W. Keys,
secured a writ of habeas corpus. At the
trial to-day Director Wllkins testified
that final action was taken on Ryan's
case at Folsom, although he had 'no*
chance to make defense, as Is customary.
Other witnesses were also placed on the
stand. The ca3e was submitted- to the

Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.-
OAKLAND, Aug. 4.â ln a race to:
save the life of George H.. <Vatt, a
young electrician, who was shocked by
2200 volts of. the deadly fluid; death
was the victor this afternoon: '* The in
jured man died at 2:45 o'clock oh a,
Southern Pacific train at Niles, while,
those.in charge' of him were, fighting
to hold him alive until a hospital in
Oakland could be reached. ' ,
The body was taken from the train
at First-street station and conveyed to
the Coroner's office." v.
The accident which proved fatal 1 oc
curred yesterday afternoon at Electra.
Amador County, where Watt was em
ployed at the Standard Electric Com
pany's big power plant. He was stand
ing on a ladder setting a brace against
a post when he' slipped, striking in. a
fall of ten feet a wire carrying the
heavy current. Watt struck on- the
back of his' neck. " He was senseless
from the 'shock, and the fluid badly
burned all his" body. Medical attention
was at- hand. 'For a time there seemed
to be a chance to save his life, and this
morning the patient was started for
Oakland to be sent to a hospital. Dr.
E. E. Endicott and H. S. McKillips, of
the Standard Electric Company, came
with Watt. He sank slowly on, the
journey, and expired before II . was.
completed. /-Watt was twenty-nine
years old. He had relatives at Tacoma.
In assueV to Mr. Rowe's allegation that I
did not turn the books over to the Board of
fupervieorE, Fitting as a Xioard of Equaliza
tion, in. the time specified by law, Mr. Kowe
is b\ least mistaken.
Under the law the Assessor is allowed
twenty Cays alter the erst Monday in July
to complete the assessment roll. 1 turned the
aestFt'inent roll over to the clerk of the Board
cf Equalization on Saturday. July 22, whereas
I had until July 24. The Board of Equaliza
tion under the law Is allowed two weeks to
Â«.-qua!ize the assessments. This year they com
menced eUting as a Board of Equalization on
.'Saturday. July 22, and will end their session
to-morrcw. August 0. this, as I figure it, being
twÂ«> weeks, the time allowed by law and the
same length DC time In which they have equal
â¢ lied during other years.
Ue No. 1 aailtd. Who is a, faker?
Mr. Howe quotes roe as t-aying; "He says
that his a^seisnitnt o' the Traction and Key
â¢ Route companies is only 25 per cent of their
value." I defy Mr. â¢ Rowe or any ether per
eon, responsible cr Irresponsible, to show one
instance wherein I have said that the Trac
tion* or Key U'.iuii comr>anies are assessed at
25 per cent of th'tr value. I have never said
'so and I believe that Mr. Rowe knew it
whf r. he made the statement.
The properties o( the above companies are .
assessed by me at what I consider their cash :
.value. L.!e No. 2 nailed. iVho Is the faker?
Mr. Rowe points to the assesfment of the
backs. In answer let me say that the prop
erty of the banks of this county is assessed
higher than any other class of property on
,Â» apecunt oc so much of their property being
in the shape of mortgage::, which are assessed
Â£t about one hundred cents on the dollar.
The meney -and assessable securities of the
, banKs are assessed as sworn to by the bank
officials.
Mr. Rowe Implied that the assessment on
Sioney made against the Central Bank and the
Â£kland Bank \u25a0\u25a0: Savings was not made as
â¢ # U should have beÂ«n.
BA.VK ASHBSSHEBrra
Permit me to Â«ay to Mr. Rowe and all other
people Interested, that I. as Assessor, have
the sworn statements as to the amount of
Â«nosey and securities held by their banks, of
Hi*. Anson Blake, cashier at the Central j
Bank, and Mr. W. w. Oarth'walte. cashier of
the Oakland Bank of Saving.-, and the assess
ments against their banks was based on their
sworn statements.
- I Co not- believe that there is a man, woman
or .child in the county of Alameda that would
not take Mr. Blake's and Mr. Garthwaite's
â¢ word in any busirreef transaction. I have
found the banks of this county always rwady
to-straignten out and fix up any error made
â¢ In their assessments, whether it be for or
- agamet them. The real estate and improve
ments of the bank have been assessed equally
.* and in proportion .to other real estate and
Â» improvements in the county.
MY. Rowe .complains, because thÂ» county paid
n> bill of SISO for various trips which I made
to Sacramento in 'trying to .prevent the State
â¢ Ooard of Equalization from increasing the
valuation of Alameda County property about
i 10 per cent, and coming from a man who
lives in a glass house,-' the complaints is good.
As a matter of fact, if the valuation had
faeen raised as contemolated it would have
.* taken about $lÂ«0, 000 additional out of the pock
ets of tne taxpayers.
I I claim iome credit for defeating the con
templated ra!sÂ«, and I feel that the taxpayers
cf the county will agree that the $100 was
jr. or f-y well expended .
Now let us - see where Mr. Rowe gets off.
lie waa officially notified that the State
:Board's consideration of ihe Alameda County
â¢ assessment would be takea up at 10 o'clock
c.- nj. Mr. Rowe did not reach the board rooms
â¢ ' until half past- 11 a. m.. or until after the
Alameda County assessment had been finally
'. <4iÂ£ixisfcd of.
Mr. Rowe's visit was therefore useless.
Under Â«ucb circumstances it would be nat
ural, to think that a high-minded man actuated
by a desire to cave the ' taxps yers ail unncces
7* *ary expense would charge the county only
fcis actual expenses.
But doe* Mr. Rowe do it?
* # nO\VE A FL\A.\CIEB. -,
-If b* said his railroad fere both ways: the
amount would be about $0, but Mr. Rowe'
. rnagsanim<si9ly lets the county .off with a
charge of $16, putting into his own pocket a
modest profit of only 2<XÂ» per cent per >day,
/lot t^r annum, for he returned to Oakland
the tune As.y. \u25a0 ;â¢
Mr. Rowe is a good financier for Mr. Rowe.
The get-rtch-quick ech^mers and the" "loans
to salaried people" sharks can get pointers
from 'him that will make their own methods
look honeet and moderate in comparison.'
Who 1Â» the faker? . â¢ '. /
Mr. Rowe ' says, â¢ referring to me: "He 1Â» re
â¢ . aoonslble for the fact that the county is co
heavily taxed a a it if." Let me call the
attention of the people to the above state
â¢â¢ iaent.'
The Ae&eesor le responsible simply for ' the
amount of the assessment, of .the .county, and
â¢ the Board of Supervisors is responsible for the
amount of money collected and expended. -Let
us look at the increase in the assessment roll
\u25a0 and the increase In the expense of the county
eince Mr. Row* has been a Supervisor.
In lÂ»0!, Mr. Rowe's first year, the county
v as assessed at $87,497,484, a tax rate of $1 25
on inside property and ?l 65 on outside prop
erty was fixed, which was collected from the
people and expended by the Board of Super
visors, the amount Ixing $1,174,760 â¢es.' : Two
years later, with an awaessment of $128,555,
â¢ "217 20, the Board cf Supervisors fixed Â« tax
rate of $1 37 on inside property and Jl 72 on
outside property, which realized the county for
running expenses the immense and unheard
of cum of $1.642.t25 44. or an increase of
$GCB,O(>4 76 for county expenses In two years'
time after Mr. Rowe was elected Supervisor.
* INCREASE OF TAXES.
Who is responsible .for the lnerease""!n your
taxes? I cay that Mr. Rowe Is in the face of
the above showing.
Who Is a faker? * â¢
Mr. Rowe seems to be very particular about
equalizing the assessment of the property of
the county. Now this fact was called to my
attention this morning. Mr. Rowe built a
bouse on the rear end of els lot where he
OAKLAND, Aug. 4.â The word
"faker" Is becoming the official term
of contempt and abuse in Alameda
â¢County. Yesterday Supervisor H. D.
Rowe of East Oakland took occasion
in an open meeting of the board to
brand County Assessor Henry P. Dalton
.as a "political faKer." To-day County
Assessor Ualton issued an open letter
in whica he put Mr. Rowe on the grid
iron and argues that it is the Super
visor who is the faker. Dalton scores
some hot points on Rowe.
And so the county officials are
battling back and forth, and are start
lag an official and political row that
will echo down the course of Alameda
County politics for several conventions
to come. Both are men of influence In
the political wprld and have large fol
lo wings.
The following is the signed state
ment Assessor Dalton issued to-day:
in ch&Tfc-insr me with official dereliction In
the rcta-tter of assessment* Supervisor Kowe
tcakea x.'.-.*. extr&oniinary confession that h*
i lias tor three year* bÂ«en neglecting hiÂ» own
mcm duty.
He says I have twen for that period under
fisbet-ting certain corporation!, which he re
â¢ f rains from calling by name yet in ell that
tiiae he bus never made the slightest effort
to correct thÂ« public wrong of wcich he alleges
he was cognizant.
He has sat on the Board of Equalization
all this time and. allowed the alleged under
assessments to etand without protest, making
no move to correct them, or bring them to the
attention of the Assessor and the other mem
bers of the board.
â¢ * With much fire and .fury he mentions the
epeclnc inetance cj the assessment of a bank,
â¢which he alto refrained from naming, giving
figures to back, up his assertion. If Supervisor
Itowe knowe of any such Instance it was
obviously his sworn duty to call attention - to
abe matter In the Board of Equalization and
move to have the assessments adjusted in ac
cordance with bis idea of the amount on which
the sald^bank should pay. taxes.
It is alto a self-evident proposition that if
certain corporations and banks are under
assessed within Mr. Howe's knowledge It was
his (tron duty to endeavor to have those
assessments raised His own admissions, made
fo aflord him. a pretext lor assailing me, con-
Vict him cf failure to keep his oath to enforce
"the law relating to assessments.

The frequent application of members of
the San Francisco Fire Department to be
declared- bankrupts has caused tne.Board
of Fire Commissioners to inquire into the
subject, as it has been represented that
the men are using the bankruptcy court
as a means to avoid paying just debts.
Information has been received by the
board that over one hundred members of
the department are contemplating pro
ceedings to.^, avoid payment of their
debts. ."
Xv'hile,". thb desire to
stamp out the evil ' before it grows large
enough o to' 1 make, a laughing stock-of the
department; 'they in no wise wish to
hinder a man in the ranks from the
honest use of the bankruptcy law. Word
came to the department that in some in
stances the men were using the protec
tion of the courts to avoid paying pef
sonal expenses.
The board ordered that the men who
1 have already been declared bankrupts
shall appear and show cause why they
shall not be dismissed from the depart
ment. Those who are applying or about
to apply to the board will be cited to ap
pear and show why they are making ap
plication to the" courts for relief.
Awaiting final settlement of the troubles
between the captain and lieutenant of
Engine Company No. 30, the communica
tion/of Lieutenant T. J. Kelly asking for
transfer has been laid over. Captain D.'
B. Sewell has requested that he be not
transferred and charges were' ordered
preferred against him by the board.
Sewell will be called upon to show a rea
son why -he shall not.be transferred. Bad
feeling has existed between the men for
some time.
Charges were ordered filed against
\u25a0Hoseman James F. "Campbell of Engine
Company No. 12 for_ reporting late for
duty; against Driver "John Farrell of the
same company for leaving the house
without permission; against M. riaggerty
of Truck No. 8 for overstaying leave; and
James McNamara for intoxication. The
superintendent of- horses reports that
"pinkeye" will deplete the . number of

Captain R. T. Lawless, commander of the
Oceanic Steamship Company's lin^r Marlpcsa,
v.as married the other day to Miss Ada B.
MiHer of Oakley, Cal. Captain Lawless lost
his first wife some time ago. Death came
eÂ«er a long and painful illness, during which
Mr* Lawless required constant professional
attendance. It was Miss Miller, a gradual,
nurse who was called In to care for the sick
woman. Tenderly and faithfully she per
formed her duties, and between nurse and pa
tient there grew up a warm friendship, until
the nurse became a* a member of the family.
The rratitude with which Captain Lawless i re
rardf-d the devoted attention of his wife 6
nurse laid the foundation for a stronger feel
ing and shortly after the Mnriposa's arrival
the other day from Tahiti CapUin Lawless
and M'.ss Miller were quietly married. They
will make their home In this city.

The Pacific Coasi Steamship Com
pany's little wliite liner Curacao. Cap
tain R. J. Paulsen, which arrived late
Thursday night from Mexico, passed
quarantine soon after sunrise yester
day siiorning and ducked at Broad
way "wharf. The Curacao brought a
large aad very valuable cargo and 52
passengers, ishe would have had more
passengers had not about two score
people who wanted to come to this port
tvora Mazatlan Imagined they would
get here quicker by taking the Kosmos
liner Animon. l!ui they uidn't by twen
ty-four hours, for the Aramon did not
reach port until too late last night to
pass quarantine.
The Ammon reached Ensenad.i ahead
of the Curacao and was partly dis
charged when the little whit'o boat
dropped her anchor at 2 a. m.
. The Ammon had every lighter in En
scnada engaged and Captain Paulsen's
chances of speedy dispatch did not look
very rosy. But Captain Paulsen has
not been going into Mexican ports for
years without learning how to get out
again with the least possible waste of
time. At daybreak a boat left the Cu
racao and long before either Ensenada
or the people on the Ammon were
awake. Captain Paulsen had com
mandeered four of the most commodi
ous lighters in the harbor. There was
a Teutonic roar when the Ammon's
slcipper turned out and discovered the
American boat busily discharging
freight into the Ammon's lighters.
Nothing is done in a hurry in Mexico.
It took the Ammon's captain and the
Kosmos agent until <S p. m. to demon
strate the Ammon's right to the light
ers. While the argument waged the Cur
acao was working cargo and when Cap
tain Paulsen was finally notified that
he must give up the lighters the Cura
oao was ready to take her departure.
The German captain acknowledged
his defeat gracefully and when the Cu
racao blew her good-by salute the
Kosmos liner's whistle responded with
three long, loud blastr.
Chief Officer Thomas Quinn, who has
been on the Curacao for many years
and who has been ailing for the last
two or three trips, was quite ill when
the steamer docked and is now recu
perating at the Marine Hospital. He
expects to return to duty in about two
months and in the meantime Thomas
Boyd. second mate or the Gipsy, will
take Quinn's place. Qulnn is prob
ably the oldest and ablest mate in the
Pacific Coast Company's service and is
one of the most picturesque characters
in the local shipping world. He is a
thorough sailorman and is highly es
t^pjned by his superiors. No more faith
ful officer ever trod a deck.
The Curacao's passengers included
the following:

STEAMER DAY â Business. City.
"Steamer day" was, in the early days of
San Francisco, a peculiar phrase, which
has in modern times in the commercial
world been supplemented by "collection
day." In the old days steamer day was
a day prior to the departure of a steamer
for Panama with passengers and treasure
for tho East via the Isthmus ef Darien.
and the steamer from Asplnwall, now
Colon, the day on which the merchants
made their collections to remit East and
the day on which the residents sent their
letters to relatives and friends, who. if
living in the East, were thirty days
apart by letter. Steamer day was usually
among merchants three days before the
Ist and 16th of each month. For letter
writers it was the . day before the sail
ing of an eastbound steamer.

Dr. Wallace Wood, of the University

love of beauty.
"The love of beauty," he said, "is not

as it should be. Things only that are
useful are considered valuable; beau
tiful things are too often regarded as
unimportant.
"This popular idea of the usefiil's un
speakable superiority over the merely
beautiful may be illustrated by a hap
pening in a barber shop.
"A barber in cutting a young man's
hair, snipped off a piece of his oar.
"The young man leaped from the
chair. He cried in anguish and horror:
. " 'Oh, you have cut a piece of my ear
off I'

And add a wee bit to its sum of renown.
Or any old thing that would not pull it
down-
He knocked.

He knocked;
He said 'twas a useless, ridiculous chase.
So he knocked.
The cause of the true and the cause of
the right,
He said it was futile to follow them.

So all of the day and all of the night
He knocked.
One day at the upper and beautiful gate
He knocked;
Though he vowed that the portal was not
builded straight .

THE MAN AND THE WOMAN.
THE Man sank into his cushioned
chair and sighed heavily.
"I am bo weary," he half said and
half moaned.
The Woman placed her gentle hand
upon his corrugated brow and. stroking
it tenderly, sympathized with the Man.
"I am sorry for you, John." she said.
"It is a great pity that you have to work
so hard. What have you had to do to
day?"
"Everythingâ everything! From before
! 9 o'clock this morning until after 4 this
afternoon it was work, work, workâ the
regular routine, you know. I scarcely got
a moment's rest except during my lunch
eon hour."
"Poor John, poor John!" the Woman
tenderly said, as she still gently stroked
his brow; "it is too badâ too bad!"
This did the Woman comfort and sym
pathize with the Man. . Did he comfort
and' sympathize with the Woman? Of
course, not. As everybody knows, it was
quite unnecessary, for she had nothing
to doâ that Is, nothing except to take care
of the baby, look after the older children,
cook for the family, set the table, wipe
and wash the dishes, mend the kids'
clothing, keep track of the laundry, order
the groceries and other provisions, at
tend to social duties, comfort the old
man and a few things of that nature
which really are scarcely worth mention.
The Man would have sympathized with
her, but. as any one can see, there was
nothing that called for lt-
But you can bet that It is a great pity
about John.
George Gould as a rule is accessible to
such book agents as have been fortunate
enough to establish a selling acquaint
anceship with him; but all others are ex
cluded, save in ca^es where the nature of
the publication is made known in advance
â a most unpopular procedure among the
fraternity, since nothing but a personal
canvass avails for success.
Mr. Gould is guarded from intrusion by
an efficient corps of clerks, and that in
dividual who penetrates their inexorable
cordon must be gifted in strategy. It is
a matter of record that the feat has only
once been accomplished in triumph.
It was on a very warm afternoon in
July. So suffocating was the atmosphere
that the clerks at the Western Union
headquarters went about their duties in
shirt sleeves. A young man who present
ed his card was met more curtly than
usual.
"Mr. Gould is not buying any books at
present."
Without a word the caller meekly de
parted. Only the clerk at the outer desk
had figured In the Incident, aqd he speed
ily forgot about it. Other clprks contin
ued to flit along the halls from door to
door and in and out of Mr. Gould's private
office.
Suddenly a young man In shirt sleeves
passed behind a partition in the outer of
fices, strode through the door of an ante
room, threaded his way past numerous
tables and desks crowded with, secreta
riesâand at last reached the inner finan
cial sanctuary wnere sat Mr. Gould in
person immersed in a mass of stocks and
bonds which were undergoing a question
ing examination.
Seizing a chair, the clerk planted It be
side Mr. Gould, and without waiting to be
addressed, began smoothly:
"Mr. Gould, I have here the first an
nouncement of a new de luxe edition
without a peer."
Mr. Gould frowned for a moment, and
then smiled.
"Very clever," he nodded. "I will sign
an order for a set. I shall also give in
structions that my cerks must wear their
coats. I can't afford to be interrupted by
this game again." ; .'; . .
It was the same young man that had
previously been refused an audience by
the clerk at the desk!â New York Times.

Dr. G. V. A. Robertson, of Pickering,
reports to the Yorkshire Post: "On
Saturday I received a call to visit the
son of a farmer. The message was:
"The lad has been bitten by a fish.' On
my arrival -I found the lad suffering
from a severe wound on the right foot,
which required several stitches. On
making inquiries I was told that ' the
lad had been bathing along with two
others in the River Leven, which runs
near to the farm, at Sinnington, and
on getting out of the water he sat on
tho bank, as lads are wont to do, when
suddenly a large fish jumped out of the
water on to the' bank, seized the lad
by the foot and jumped in again. The
distance from the water to the edge of
the bank was quite two feet, and the
lad's foot was three -feet from the edge
of the bank. A lady who was passing
and heard his cries went to bis assist
ance and carried him home, as the foot
was bleeding profusely. A gentleman
who stays at tho farm and is an en
thusiastic angler asked to be shown the
place, and said he would try to catch
the fish. On taking his- fishing tackle,
he had the gratification of catching the
fish in a few minutes with an artificial
bait. It turned out to be. a fine pike,
measuring two feet one and one-half
inches long, and weighing six pounds.
There can be no doubt," adds the doc
tor, "as to the truth of the occurrence,
for I not only saw the lad and the fish,
but I also saw the fish measured and
the gentleman who caught it." â Phila

All the push that some men display in this life is behind a baby car
riage.âStaunton (Va.) Leader.
AFTER the Spanish war and the sanitary revelations and ad
vance incident to the emergencies of that brief struggle, it
was supposed that science had exempted American cities
from yellow fever. While this confident feeling was general, the
country is alarmed by an outbreak of the scourge at New Orleans.
It has steadily spread from its initial point in that city and has ap
peared elsewhere in Alabama and at Morgan City, La.
.â¢ In its sanitation New Orleans is probably the worst of Ameri
can cities and the most inviting to any epidemic. Surface sewerage
prevails there, the water table is so near the top of the ground that
burial is not practiced at all, and the cemeteries are made to look
like miniature cities by the structures above ground in which the
dead find sepulture. The water supply is by cisterns and the catch
of rainwater from the roofs. These cisterns are as . many storied
as the house they supply. They are left open at the top, and every
cistern is a breeding place for mosquitoes, which infest the city in
clouds. When yellow fever breaks out these insects are ready to
spread it. The rapid distribution of the disease beyond the point
of its first appearance is doubtless due to the mosquitoes. This ex>
plains the effort of the Board of Health td have the cisterns screened.
One would suppose that the people would cover and protect the
cisterns without compulsion, but as a measure of cleanliness. -But
this is not done, and the Board of Health finds difficulty in compel
ling it to be done.
There is nothing that throws our Southern people into such a
panic as yellow fever. Its sinister spread, its invasion of. the home
of poverty and the home of wealth alike, and in each equally irre
sistible, its rapid course and usually fatal termination, inspire a
.terror that is not caused by cholera or smallpox, the other two dis
eases most feared in this country.
The appearance of the fever inflicts losses beyond its fatalities.
The suffering community is shut off fr6m the rest of the world.
Business is entirely suspended and all of the activities of- a great
city are paralyzed. The thought of this isolation is held by some
to predispose to the disease. But science has demonstrated beyond
a doubt that a mental state has nothing to do with it. It originates
in a specific germ. This once introduced into the system, the hope
ful and the hopeless, the optimist and the pessimist, pious and
ribald, alike fall. The work of science is to prevent the culture of
this germ and its distribution by insects or other means. The men
.of science are nobly standing by their guns hr New Orleans, and
will finally conquer. In the process they will, get valuable experi
ence, useful to the world in the next epidemic.
THE DREADED TEVER.
JAPAN'S MODERATION.
THE Western world has its sharpest' attention fixed upon the
Japanese-Russian peace negotiations, and the incidents pre
ceding the conference. The expressions of Russian sentiment
fluctuate. Since De Witte left St. Petersburg he has nearly reversed
himself. This change followed the clerical warwhoop by the priests
of Orenburg and the Czar's flamboyant reply. It made the world
doubt that the conference would effect anything. The attitude, of
â¢Japan has remained unchanged. She wants only such a settlement
as a Western nation would demand under the same circumstances,
and a far more merciful settlement than Germany forced upon
France.
The Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs disavows the ambi
tions imputed to his country, which have served as the substance of
the alarm about the yellow peril. He wants her territory^ restored
to. China and permanent peace in order that Korea and China, in
fluenced by the example of- Japan, may not only retain their inde
pendence, "but safeguard it by taking the benefit of modern progress
and civilization. This will develop their resources by use of their
own capital and labor, and will increase their commerce for the
benefit of all the commercial nations. Japan wants only justice
and a square deal in Eastern Asia, and her sincerity in expressing
this desire is not open to suspicion.
The Japanese method may be usefully studied. From the be
ginning of the war until now her commanders on sea and land and
her statesmen and press have not uttered a word of bitterness
against Russia. There has been none of that planting of the seeds
of permanent hatred, ill feeling and antagonism which has charac
terized great wars between the Western nations. The French and
Germans, Italians and Austrians, Dutch and Spaniards, have car
ried ancient antagonisms that originated in the hatreds of war for
generation after generation. We are only recently getting fid of
hatred of the English people that began in our revolution, more than
a century and a quarter ago. In each of these cases of transmitted
ill feeling the cause may be found in that sort of expression from
which Japan has carefully abstained. Russian prisoners have been
treated* with the most humane consideration, and after her victories
Japan has done nothing to increase Russian humiliation.
-One may not now effectively analyze the situation. Jatjan has
made war against what was regarded as the foremost military na
tion of the world. She has done this in the interest of her own in
dependence and from a stern sense of duty. Reasoning from the
occidental point of view, the believers in the yellow peril have con
cluded that she will of course follow up her advantage, annex Korea,
retain control of Manchuria, threaten our sovereignty of the Philip
pines and combine Asia for an invasion of the West. To this her
statesmen frankly reply that the ambitions imputed to her involve
the conduct for which she makes war upon Russia. Regarding those
ambitions in Russia as wrong, she cannot think they would become
right by entertaining them herself. She does not desire to do
wrong by placing herself in the original position of her defeated
antagonist. Therefore she will only promote justice and propagate
civilization in Eastern Asia, not by the sword but by example.
The extreme wisdom of this cannot be too highly estimated.
It is notice to the world that seizure of Chinese territory has reached
its limit. Europe must be contented with what it has taken. If
Japan entered the field as a competitive land-grabber, she \Vould
have all the European nations that have grabbed already as her an
tagonists. There would be no moral force in her position and she
would forfeit the esteem she has now deserved. She would also
become responsible for further war, which might easily involve the
greater part of the world. Therefore she chooses to increase hu
manity's debt by careful abstention from the policies that the yellow
peril prophets have said she would adopt in the arrogance of vic
tory.
In all of this how vast is the influence of Japan upon the world !
By keeping strictly to her course she will influence for the better
the international policy of every country. She will rule the world
by the splendor of her example, and not, like Rome, by the sword.
This ascription is not too high. In the past, victors in war have
too little scrupled in pushing a purely seifisft advantage. Germany
did this upon France and all of continental Europe has been sitting
on a keg of powder ever since. The harmony and progress of
France have been retarded by the cherishing of a dream of revenge,
and Germany has been burdened by the maintenance of a military
establishment made necessary to resist the vengeance of a pe6ple
who feel that they were unnecessarily humiliated. Indeed, we need
look no further than our own country for sectional animosities long
outliving the Civil War, not rooted in our victory, but in the use
made of it in the civic disabilities and the acts of reconstruction.
It will be a great day for Christendom when Japan refuses to do the
tame wrong she punished when attempted by another, and intro
duces the golden rule for the guidance of the nations.

According to the story told the court
by Patrolman Daggett, the youth from
Russia brought his trouble upon him
self. While touring, the Asiatic quar
ter he indiscreetly accosted a Nipponese
maiden, and when she scorned his ad
vances he addressed to her some Russ
language which would not bear trans
lated transcription. She may not have
understood what he said, but his man
ner convinced her that insult was in
tended, and sufficed to provoke her to
shrill a complaint that brought to the
spot a number of masculine Japs. -
They fought each other for the privi
lege of fighting him. Like hiving bees
they clung to him In bunches, ham
mered his head and face and kicked his
nether limbs. To their numerical
strength he owed escape from much in

rescued him the injuries he had re
ceived were surprisingly slight, consid

and fled to Seattle, where she was ar
rested. On her return she gave as a
reason for her flight â¢ that Matron Ma
tilda Christ of the City Prison had been
urging her to enter a "sporting house,"
which Mrs. Christ emphatically denied.
Detective Bailey was detailed to make
an investigation, and he made a report
about ten days 1 ago -to the effect that
he could obtain no corroboration of the
charge against Mrs. Christ except that
she had deceived the Judge In with
holding from him the fact that the
young woman had been employed as a
waitress in a bakery.

Ctty Attorney Long yesterday filed
with the Mayor a report of the busi

Jun<? 30. 1305. There were 241 suits
rommenced against the <clty and county
or its officers during the year named.
Two hundred and fifty-three actions in
which the city was interested were de
rided in the Superior and Justices'
courts, four in the Supreme Court,
three in the United States Circuit Court
j=nd one in the Supreme Court of the
United States. The four that passed
through the Supreme Court were de
cided in favor of the city, one of them
upholding the validity of the recent
bond issue of $17,171,000. Another de
termined the validity of the charter
abolishing the fees of stenographers in
the police courts. That saves to the
city from $10,000 to $12,000 a year. A
third sustained an assessment of $350,
f'oo levied on the solvent credits of the
pavings and Loan Society. Consider
able progress was made during the
year with the trial of the suit of the

when seventeen-year-old Carl Hoglund,
for many years a hopeless cripple and
the sole support of his aged mother,
saw Dr. Buell remove the torn stumps
of two fingers of his left hand. The
digits had been crushed between cog
wheels at the Pacific Rope Works.
After the young man's wounds were
dressed he recounted that he had ex
perienced seventeen operations for hip
joint disease and concluded that suffer
ing was his lot in life.
"I support my widowed mother/" said
he, "and this last blow makes me pow

was born, anyhow?"
"Don't get discouraged." said Dr.
Buell, "for there is a future ahead of
you yet."
"Well," said the brave young fellow,
"I'll cheer up for mother's sake."
Then he went to his widowed mother,
who lives at 17 Welch street, resolved
to take up the burdens of life again
with renewed determination to win de

CHILD OF MISFORTUNE â¢
L.IVES FOR HIS MOTHER
CITY ATTORNEY LOXG
FILE* AXMAL REPORT
Robert Hansen, a young teamster,
oleaded absence of intent to steal when
Judge Fritz dismissed the peace dis
turbance charge on which Thomas
Acosta. an instrumentalist of the Mexi
can Band, was arrested on complaint of
Mrs. L. Marquis of 142% Powell street,
where his wire and two children reside.
The Acostas are parties to a divorce
suit pending before \u25a0 Superior Judge
Sloss, and when the husband claimed
right to possess the younger child, a
baby, the 1 wife exhibited what she al
leged was an order of court awarding
the infant to her custody. Soon after
ward the husband ascertained that no
such order had been Issued, and last
Sunday he forcibly carried away the
little one to his home in* South San
Francisco, whereupon Mrs. Marquis,
doubtless instigated by Mrs. Acosta,
had him arrested for peace disturbance.
When arrested by" Patrolman W. Y.
Douglass a few hours later, Mr. Foley
denied Mr. Kennedy's accusation, and
Judge Conlan has continued the case in
order to afford him opportunity to
prove an alibi, which he professes abil
ity to do. The plunder abstracted from
Mr. Kennedy's trousers consisted of
one package of tobacco and ninety
cents.
Robert Kennedy was asleep In his
room, at 6 Brady street, the hour be
ing 2 a. m., when a noise awakened
him, and in the semi-darkness he dimly
perceived a man searching the pockets
of the pantaloons which he (Mr. X.)
had doffed before he retired. He in
stantly leaped from his couch, but not
quickly enough to capture the visitor,
who fled and escaped immediate cap
ture, but not probable identification, as
Mr. Kennedy swears he recognised him
as Patrick Foley.
James Rogers, a building contractor,
avers that he must have been deeply
intoxicated if he burglariously entered
Charles Johnson's apartment at 17
Fourth street and stole therefrom a
gold watch and chain and $2 50 cash;
but hÂ» Is Inclined to believe that he
never committed the alleged offense at
all. Mr. Johnson and Patrolman T. F.
Flood, however, are pretty 'positive that
Mr. Rogers did perpetrate said burg
lary, and Judge Fritz has set the hear
ing of the charge for next Wednesday,
with ball fixed in the sum of $1000.
When the owner of the impromptu play
thing expostulated he was hilariously in
sulted by Mr. Wallace, and It was for
that feature of the entertainment that
Judge Frits Imposed a fine of $5, which
was paid.
"Gee. folks. Just see 'er go!" he glee
fully shouted as he spun the rack until
its velocity made the footgear upon it
almost indistinguishable. "Ain't she a
bute?" he asked the amused onlookers.
John Wallace laughingly declared that
for the life of him he could not adduce
logical reason for the silly conduct al
leged against him by Patrolman Holmes.
"I think I was born a cut-up," he
chuckled, "for I have been a cut-up as
long as I can remember."
The "cuttlng-up" for which Mr. Wal
lace- was arrested occurred on Kearny
street, and consisted of his absurb whirl-
Ing of a revolvable stand upon which
boots and shoes were displayed at the
door of a dealer in those useful articles of
merchandise.
"Ask him how he cultivated that chin
appendage." said the Judge, gazing with
admiration, not unmixed with envy, at
the defendant's abundant whisker crop.
"He says," responded the interpreter,
after a tedious exchange of vernacular
with the defendant, "that he is an Aino
from Northern Japan, where perpetual
snow exists and beards are grown and
nurtured to protect the throat from the
severe cold that exists almost throughout
the year. The faces of the women of that
region, he says, also are whiskered,
though less heavily than the men, and
tradition has it that a smooth-faced
female Aino is unbeloved of the gods."
"Do tell," murmured his Honor, and
then he continued the hearing in order to
afford Mr. Sato opportunity to rally
friends to bis aid.
In this country, however, every man
seems to be constantly guarding his
property from theft. Mr. Sato would like
to add that in the Mikado's empire, even
if a man of such respectable ensemble as
he presented did pound a door, no police
man would presume to stay his hand,
much less subject him to the indignity of
arrest and incarceration.
interpreter, was to the effect that he
simply tried to arouse the drowsy in
mates of. and thus obtain admittance to,
the house in which he has dwelt ever
since he came to this disappointing land.
In his own country there never is occa
sion calling for the thumping of a door,
because no man fears unwarranted inva

he loaded his wagon with second-hand
bricks which were piled upon a vacant
lot at North Beach. He had seen other
persons "help themselves in similar
manner, he informed Judge Conlan, and
one man. name not disclosed, had told
him that the bricks were free to any
one who wanted them, and that the
owner of the lot was only too glad to
sac them carted away. Mr. Hansen In
tended to pave the yard of his dwelling
with the bricks which he took. \u25a0
Now, the owner of the property Is the
Globe Grain and Milling Company, and
it was a representative of that corpora
tion. G. B. Ochiltree, who had Mr. Han
sen arrested and charged with larceny.
No person was authorized to remove
the bricks, Mr. Ochiltree told the Judge,
and if other persons had "helped them
selves," as alleged by Mr. Hansen, then
those other persons would quickly find
themselves in a plight similar to that
In which Mr. Hansen there stood.
The Judge continued the case till
next Friday, and Mr. Ochiltree an
nounced his intention to employ the in
terim in scouring the city and recover
ing his missing bricks.
John Sang-ulnetti, retailer of fruits
and vegetables on Seventh street,
handled a side line of alleged whisky
and thus cut into the trade of neigh
boring saloonists so deeply as to impel
them to complain to Patrolman Thomp
son of the illegal competition, Signor
Sanguinetti having no license to sell
alcoholic liquors. So the policeman
disguised himself, visited the Sanguin
etti store and requested the sigrnor to
provide him with ten cents' worth of
whisky, whereupon the signor filled a
pint bottle with amber liquid, handed
it to his visitor and accepted the prof
fered dime.
"And here is what he sold me, your
Honor," said the officer to Judge Fritz,
before whom Signor Sangulnetti was
arraigned on the charge of selling 1 liq
uor without a license.
"Take it away!" hastily exclaimed
the Judge, shrinking from the tendered
exhibit. "It can't be whisky, for that
quantity of anything 1 savoring even
remotely of whisky could not be profit
ably sold for ten cents. It may be an
explosive of some kind â a deadly
weapon. Take it away, and, please,
handle it very carefully. This defend
ant cannot be convicted of selling 1
whisky without license, but he might
possibly be punished, for obtaining ten
cents under false pretenses. Take it
away!" /.

John Francis Green, second officer of:
the steamship Siberia, was taken into
custody yesterday by United States Se
cret Service Agent Richard H. Taylor on
a charge of having obtained naturaliza
tion papers fraudulently; Green was com
mitted to jail in default of $5000 bonds.
Agent Taylor discovered that Green, a
subject of Great Britain, '. came to the
United States in 1900. Two weeks after
his arrival he received a paper purporting
to be a certified copy of naturalization
papers granted in Judge Bahr'a court,
under date of Kovember 8, 1900. The
names of the witnesses on the paper are
William. Cunningham of 733 A Clementina
street, and Alic Carrt of 164 South Park.
The names of George H. Bahrs, Judge,
and William A. Deane, Clerk, are affixed
with a rubber stamp, and the document is
signed with pen and ink in the name of
W. C. Raisch. deputy clerk. The signa
ture is in the same handwriting: as that
of the written part of the certificate. The
paper bears the seal of the court. On the
back is the indorsement, "Voting register,
precinct 16, Assembly District 29, July 7,
1904. Frank A. Taron." indicating that
Green had become registered as a voter
by the presentation of the certificate.
Raisch informed Agent Taylor that his
purported signature was a rank forgery.
Green said that the certified copy had
been handed to him by William Cunning
ham, whose name appears thereon as a
witness. A search of the records' In the
County Clerk's office ehowed that there
was no original of the copy on file or any
minute of Green's naturalization in that
court.
. Upon being "sweated" in the jecret ser
vice office Green admitted that shortly
after having received the pretended copy
of the naturalization certificate he had
presented it to Captains Bolles and Bul
ger, United States local inspectors, and
had been granted an American second
mate's license thereon. He admitted also
that on February 5, 1904, he received from
the same persons on the strengthof the
forged papers an American master's li
cense. He acknowledged that he had
never appeared before any court to apply
to become naturalized, but he was un
able to explain how the fraudulent paper
had been obtained.
Paul Rappmundt, one of the alleged
naturalization fraud conspirators, was
examined before United States Commis
sioner Heacock yesterday for having be
come illegally naturalized on the testi
mony of Ernest Graesner in Judge Gra
ham's court. The hearing was continued
for a few days in order to obtain the at
tendance of an important witness.
Mrs. Nellie Grady, who was arrested
with Miss Virginia Scott in Weinstock,
L-Ã¼bin &. Co.'s store on. Thursday evening
for shoplifting, grew hysterical and fell
in a swoon when posed before the police
camera yesterday morning. To have her
photograph exhibited in the rogues' gal- '
lery \va.s a prospect that drove her fran- i
tic, a:;d Photographer Blum had to sum- ;
ition Dr. Jones to quJet her. The attempt i
to have her likeness preserved among the
criminal records was given up.
The girl associate was tractable, how
ever, and her photograph was taken. Miss
Scott and Mrs. Grady were escorted to
gether to the gailery, and Mrs. Grady
began fainting when the matron led her
from the celL When the woman finally
ewooned in his arms Blum decided he
had liad enough of the Job.
Captain Cullundan of Morse's detective
fluency and Special Officer Allen identi
fied Miss Scott as having been in trou-
M<Â» before. In the beginning of April she
and Mrs, Harry Graham, a daughter of
Mrs. Grady, were arrested by Allen In
the Emporium for shoplifting. When
before the manager he refused to
prefer a charge against them owing to
Miss Scott's youth and her promise that
the would- give up her criminal careerl
She admitted her identity, but said that
she had kept her promise till Thursday,
when Mrs. Grady induced her to go out
shopping with her.
It Is said that the girl's parents live at
O'N'eals, Madera County, and that her
father is a retired clergyman. The detec
tives are searching for a young man who
was frequently s^en in her company. She
has an aunt living at 1535V4 Eddy street.
Mrs. Grady is the divorced wife of a
brother of Attorney W. D. Grady. They
'were divorced . in Fresno about fifteen
years ago. Attorney Grady visited her
at the City Prison several times yester
day. She denies that she stole anything,
declaring that she made a profit of be
tween JTS and $9-3 per month from the
l<7dpiiag-house conducted by her at 291
Sixth street, and had no reason to steaL
She endeavors to throw the blame upon
the Scott girl, who does not hesitate to

caught and that Mrs. Grady taught her

property found in trunks in Mrs. Grady's

Coffee Act* the Jonah and Will Come Up.
A clergyman who pursues his noble
calling in a country parish In lowa,
tells of hig coffee experience:
"My wife and I used coffee regularly
for breakfast, frequently for dinner and
occasionally for supper â always the
very best quality â package coffee never
couid find a place on our table.
-In the spring of JB9C my wife was
taker, with violent vomiting, which we
had great difficulty 1n stopping.
â¢ It soen.od to come from coffee drink-
ing, but we f-ould not decide.
'In the following July., however, she
. ( was attacked a second time by the vom-
iting:. I was away Â£rom home filling an
appointment at the time and on my re-
. . .ttum I found her very low; she had lit-
erally vomited herself almost to death,
and it took some days to quiet the
trouble end restore her stomach.
"I had also experienced the same
trouble. !>ut not so violently, and had
relieved it each time by a resort to

chestnut filly -by Solitaire 11. She is
as handsome a looking youngster as
was ever bred in this State. Another
likely looking one is a bay colt by
Marius out of Maya II and a full
brother to Descuento, which won seven
straight races and was never beaten.
A big bay colt by Solitaire out _of
Straight Tip is considered by Manager
Berry to be the \u25a0" cream of the lot
as far as looks and make-up are con
cerned. Th!s colt is a wonder for size
and form and if nothing happens to him
he should be heard from in some of the
big .events of the metropolitan turf
when he starts. Mr. Berry expects that
this colt will bring a Icing's ransom at
the sale in New York.
A bay colt, a full brother to the stake
winner Voorhees, is expected to bring out
some lively bidding when he is led into
the ring. There is also a full brother to
Daruma, which was a frequent winner at
Oakland last spring.
During the last six years the Napa
Stock Farm has averaged more high
grade yearlings than any other farm
In the country. Its facilities are well
adapted to good breeding and the
climate is just right for horses. Mr.
Spreckels and Mr. Berry believe that
they will break all records this year
at the sale.

a sire of winners. He was foaled in
England in 1831 andis by Loyalist/He

One, of the/ finest yearlines of the.
The colts this year are unusually large
and handsome looking. Mr. Berry says
they are the most perfectly developed lot
of youngsters he ever laid eyes on, and
he has been training horses, and
watching them run for the last twenty
five years. He is enthusiastic over the
animals, as is Mr. Spreckels, master of
Napa Stock Farm.
Imp. Solitaire 11, the sire of most of
the youngsters, is a wonderful stal
lion. \u25a0 He is by Ayrshire, one of the
racehorses of his time. , The
lattnr's winning's . on - the turf amount
ed to $179,575. Among his: great vic
tories were the Rylar Plate at Windsor,
Chesterfield stakes at Newmarket,
Prince of Wales stakes at Goodwood,
Riddlesworth, 2000 guineas, the Cham
pagne stakes at Doncaster and many
otlftr notable events.
Solitaire, did not start in his second
xear. but as a three-year-old he; ran
second to Skopos for the Llmekin
stakes at Newmarket. At four, he was
twice first, twice second, twice third
and unplaced for the. Goodwood cup and
in two other races. Since that time
Solitaire has started in many famous
events on the British turf and brought
home many rich prizes.

On Wednesday, August 16, the fourth
handicap tournament of the California
Women Golfers' Association will be held
on the links of the Linda Vista Golf Club
at San Jose for the northern division,
and on the course of the Los Angeles
Country Club for the southern division.
Mrs. R. G. Brown, \u25a0 secretary of the
California Women's Golf Association, as
sisted by the ladies' captain of the Linda
Vista Golf Club, and Mrs. C. M. Shan
non, assistant secretary of the C. W. G.
A., aided by the ladies' captain of- the
Los Angeles Country Club, will arrange
and manage the event.
The northern division embraces the San
Francisco Golf and Country Club, the
Claremont Country Club, the San Rafael
Golf Club, the Burlingame Country Club,
the Sacramento" Golf Club, the Menlo
Golf Club and the Linda Vista Golf Club
of San Jose. In the southern division are
included the country clubs of Los An

put into thorough order.
Humboldt and Pocatelli and
Gambit and Fiery, Baden
Are Carded at Union Park
One of the coursing events of the year
will be pulled off at Union Park to-mor
row, when Pocatelli and Humboldt hook
up in the first content of the Grand Na
tional stakes. The series will consist of
the best three out of five races, and as
both dogs are full of speed and gameness
everything points to a spirited siege from
the moment the first hare is slipped.
Another interesting race will be the
trial between Gambit and Fiery Baden,
the two imported greyhounds. The latter
dog is a recent arrival from over the
pond and is said to be a wonder. He is
but thirteen months old, yet he is said to
possess all the cleverness and staying
powers cf a veteran campaigner. The
race will consist of one trial and will be
for a purse of 5100.
â¢ Besides these two special races the Un
ion Park management has two other
good c-vents on the cardâ the champion
etake and the reserve stake. Both events
contain a number of likely looking en
tries and give promise of some lively
sport.
At Ingleside Park the running will com
mence this morning at 11:30 o'clock, when
the reserve etake will be run. This event
will probably be completed before the day
Is over, so that there will be plenty of
time on Sunday to complete the other

it is not difficult to see why Captain
Spencer et al. have so few sympathizers.
Five regular and one combination boob

With the annual coast championship
tournaments less than a month off. the
local tennis cracks are putting in every
spare moment before the nets to con
dition themselves for the most important
events of the year. The Golden Gate and
California clubs will enter quite a num
ber of cracks who are not without a
chance of annexing the high honors. It
j is expected, however, the Southern Cali
fornia contingent will prove too formid
able for the local talent.
There are fewer piuyers of champion
ship caliber in this part of the State than
ever before and not more than two or
three veterans who will compete. There
are some new men o- great promise, but
as yet they cannot be depended upon.
Percy Murdock, although twice defeated
this year, looks to be the strongest player
in the bay counties. He has played ten
nis in the past that is up to the standard
of the men from the south and if he can
get back into this form he will stand
an excellent chance to carry off tne
honors.
George Baker of the Golden Gate Club
is another player who will give a good
account of himself if he competes. He
is as steady as an eight-day clock, but
it is doubtful if he has the speed to win
the highest honors. '
Fred Adams I and Carl Gardner are two
cracks who jumped into prominence this
year and at times play the game well
enough to beat any of the cracks. Each
has won a championship event this year
and. they will be by no means outclassed
in the coming tournaments.
Reubui Hunt, the Alameda expert, who
has made a good showing in the East
in the last two years, will also be in the
competition, and if he plays up to his
Eastern form would undoubtedly have a
fine chance to win. Hunt's showing at
San Rafael last year was a great dis
appointment, but he may surprise the
talent this time.
There will be at least four players from
I Southern California in the competition,
and they will all play an important part.
Ex-Champion Bell will not be here, and
the strongest player looks to be Hal
Braly. The latter played at San Rafael
three years ago and worked his way to
the semi-finals. He has undoubtedly im
proved since then, as he has been carry
ing off the honors in the south regularly
this year.
It is expected F. Elliott. Eugene Over
ton, Simpson Sinsabaugh and one or two
others will make the trip north and have
a try at the honors. AH three are clever
players, especially Overton, who at
times plays a remarkably fast game.
The famous Sutton sisters will be on
hand to defend their titles, and Miss
May will unquestionably prove the stel
lar attraction. Her wonderful record in
England this year has made her world
famous and the local enthusiasts con
sider it auite a treat to be able to see
her in action. It is expected she will
play even better than last year, when
she won quite easily.
Her sisters. Miss Florence and Mis*
Violet, have also improved, and one or
the other will make the champion extend
herself in the challenge match.
No tournaments are scheduled for the
local courts, this week's play being con
lined strictly to practice.
The annual Southern . California cham
' pionshlp tournaments are being played
\u25a0 this week. ' Eugene Overton Is the sin
'*gles champion, the doubles 'champions
! being S. M. Sinsabaugh and T. Hendrlck.
j The Sutton sisters and all of the cracks
\u25a0 who will compete at San Rafael are
I entered in the various events.

The Giants could play nothing but
bush' ball yesterday afternoon and the..
same, was in during the fourth spasm,
when the commuters grabbed three
runs after two. had gone the route/.Es-:
! sit:k was not there in the tight place
and neither were any of his iielders.i
I During -the- game the Giants piled up'
six misplays and most of, them figured 1
as "1-Vins for Oakland. ;\u25a0
Young Hogan pitched nice baseball
and had. not Briek \u25a0 De/vereaux thrown
Atz's grounder into ; the . right * field
bleachers in tha- third Portland would,
have been snowballed all the way. Bull
Croll got' into tht game once more,,
-phiying-r4ght fceld far -the .Commuters.;
Bull got a way with s^verui cnances, but
could not come; through with a hit.
. Bssick had -the goods; till "the fo.urth.
round,'-' when Atz booted Van Haltren's
grounder, and Francks, toro- off. a hit
to left. \Qunlcavy bunted both men
along. and. Kruger s.trtick. put. Then Es
sick passed Kelly and: Hogan in suc
cession,, .forcing .Van- 1 Hal tren â¢ through.
Brick . Devereaux * responded with a
drive-to left and' Francks and.- Kelly
pulled up atthe pan, making the score
3 to 1 la, Oakland's -. vor.
In the very next inning, the Giants
fell down again and allowed Oakland
to annex two more unearned runs. Dun
leavy opened' the ceremony with a two-
Backer against the left field fence and
Kruger beat out- a slow hit to second.
itcLean threw the ball away trying to
catch Dun asleep and the runner ar
rived: â¢ Kruger got to third on this
rough piece of work and scored when
Runkle threw Kelly's hit away at the
first bag. The score:

The fourth was Gardner's all the way.
He landed time and again with his left
to the jaw," and Turner seemed to slow
up.- 'The crowd was dissatisfied and
voiced its sentiments' with hisses. In- the
fifth, after Gardner had done all the
work and s<*nt in many damaging lefts to
the face. Turner took a lease of life at
ihe end of the round and rushed Gardner
to the ropes, swinging in rights and lefts
tn '"quick succession. Gardner covered up
and the crowd urged him on.
In the rixth and seventh Gardner hit
low in the. clinches and was warned by
Referee Roche. Gardner continued to do
most of the work in these periods, using
that unerring left of his all the time,
while Turner seemed content to take the
beating. In the eighth Gardner tried to
pueb Turner through the ropes and was
loudly"- hissed by the crowd. Turner had
many chances to bring In his right In the
ninth round, but he overlooked them all
and allowed Gardner to pepper him with
his left. Gardner began to give the negro
a bad beating toward the end of this
round and had him on the. way to dizzy
street.
The preliminary was won by Charles
Dunn ever Jim Bradley in the fourth
round. The latter was all In, and Referee
Aurelio Hen-era gave the decision to
Dunn. John L. Sullivan was introduced
end was given a tremendous ovation.
iota came through with a neat little
CROWD DISSATISFIED.
Timekeeper George Harting was tolling
efT the fatal, seconds when the tap of the
tell stopped further proceedings. Tur
ner, was dragged to his corner and re
vived. He came up weak in the eleventh
end Gardner stepped out to meet him.
fcuick as a flash of lightning the Lowell
boy brought his right over to the Jaw
ence again and the negro sank to the
maf, a .vanquished gladiator.
\Vhen the men stepped into the center
of the ring for the first round they stall
ed and fiddled around and Turner com
menced, to lead with his left. The crowd
did not seem to get .warmed up to the
going, f specially wh^h Gardner covered
up in that funny style of his. Billy Roche
at the end of this round said the bout
so far .was not satisfactory, and unless
the boxers made a better showing he
would declare bets off.
The second round did not improve. the
Situation materially. Turner still kept
up his work with his left and Gardner
continued to cover up. Turner overlooked
many bets with his right, and the nght
fans were c.uick to notice this. Gardner
*rot in a couple of hard lefts to the jaw
and. shook Turner up some. The third
round brought out a rally and an ex
change of rights and lefts at the gong,
which sremed to suit the crowd and make
both men a bit groggy.
TIRXER IS REVIVED.
The tenth round marked th-f beginning
â¢cf the end of the contest. Gardner start
ed in by shooting out his left to Turner's
Jaw. and following the latter all around"
the ring. Turner was getting wobbly
when Gardner shot in a hard right to
the jaw and the negro went to the floor.
He was hereiy able to regain his feet
at the count of nine, and as soon as he
stood up Gardner planted another one
.to the ssine place and Turner went to
the carpet, dead to the world."
Turner took an awful beating, a worse
one *r. fact than he ever stomached in
his life before.' Gardner cut the negro
up greatly with his left hand, closing his
tyes and cutting his 'face up badly. Tur
ner, on the other hand, did not land many
effective blows on the Lowell boy. When
ever he did. try with that wonderful right
band of his, the blow invariably went
wide of its mark, after which Gardner
would cover up and stall around* the
ring. â¢
â¢ Gardner had a peculiar way of covering
up. It may have be^n on the square with
him,- but it did not look good to the
crowd, an<l when he huddied himself into
a corner as the negro came at him the
fans were wont to >vll; "Kiss him,"* or
â¢â¢Hit him nov. and finish it. That stall
.is bad. ' Turner might have been baffled
by the Lowell man's peculiar style of
defending himself, tut he never tried very
hard to wirig in any punches during those
periods.
Gardner showed that he had a wonder
ful left hand and a gTeat kick in his other
raitt when he chose to shoot it. He also
demonstrated that he inherits his brother
George's disposition under fire. The Lo
well boy docs not like to take a beating
â¢' the least, and had Turner managed to
-id in that right of his now and then
..Â» contest might have had a different
Â« ding.
GARDNER'S LEFT GOOD.
There was an ugly rumor afloat just be
fore the battle that it was due to end in
Gardner's favcr during the seventh
round. Billy Roche, the referee, knew
this and before the bout started stated
that if there was any evidence of job
bery in the fight he would call all bets
off. He seemed on the point of doing
this several times, but let the light
take its course aud the knockout ended
ills 'responsibility.- Â»
Several times during the progress of the
fight the immense crowd seemed to
unite In the cry of "raKe." The boxers
did not wade in at each other with the
vigor and vim which should have marked
the work of two such past masters in the
art of self defense. Time and time again
Turner could have brought in his right
with deadly effect, but instead of this he
fought his fight with the left hand, some
thing the black demon has never bAn
known to do before during his long
career in the ring.
With a etifl rtffht hand punch to tbÂ«
point ct the Jaw, Jimmy GaxdAr of, lx>
well, Mass.. last night cent Rufe- Turner,
the black Stockton whirlwind, .to the
floor, a defeated boxer. The fight wu at:
Colma, â¢ . \u25a0 \u25a0
The round had Just opened and Turner
came up groggy and all in, for in the pre
ceding round he had taken the count
once and when the bell rang he was lying
on the floor, and had not the welcome
sound chimed forth when it did Turner
could never have regained his feet within
the alloted ten seconds.
Although the finish was a whirlwind
one and the knockout blow a truly legiti
mate one, the fight carried with It an un
savory odor and looked anything- but
right. Turner had chances galore to'whip
In that awful fight hand ,of bis; yet he
passed everything up. Just before the
bout started Billy Jordan ' announced
from the rlr.g that all bets would be de
clared off if everything did not look
fair, and several times during the pro
gress of the fight the referee would
certainly have been justified in stop
ping the affair and calling it no -con
test. - ,â¢â¢';;

New York Cotton Market.
NEW YORK, Aug. 4.â : The market contin
ued under pressure of .. the former bull clique,
and prices were sold down 20 to 24 points
additional from yesterday's closing | under .ig
, gressive selling and manipulation tactics. This
I break naturally influenced liquidation by out-
Dldcrs and commission houses. Late In the day
the market rallied about 15 points from the
low point, principally on the efforts of some
shorts to cover. It is . impossible to " venture
any decided prediction on the ' Immediate
course of prices In the present manipulated
state of the market.
1 The .Bureau report of ' yesterday gives us'
1 the worst conditions on record, and It means
a short crop, taking the '- abandoned acreage
and the present conditions ; with the - lateness
of the crop. The bears, notvever. claim it Is
now discounted. Liverpool will be closed to
morrow and Monday. !

All kinds Of fruit In bulk '* remained very
weak, as the regular trade was operating
cautiously in that line of good 9 and the-can

Ing concerns still being busy with contract
supplies of Bartlett Pears. The quotations for
bulk stock are withdrawn temporarily, as the
canners will stay . out of the market until the
heavy accumulation of contract stock is dis
posed of. It was reported that the dryers were
buying low-grade Bartletts at $15@17 50 per
ton. Receipts of small packages were rather
light and a firmer feeling prevailed In everyr
thing. except common Apples,, but there was no
improvement In prices of general offerings, as
local trade was rather quiet, as is usual on
Friday. Choice Seedless and Muscat Grapes
In crate 3; were In limited supply and readily
commanded good prices, while the other varie
ties were - neglected, although offered at low
rates. In the Melon line Cantaloupes were
firmer and Watermelons steady, while Nut
megs were lower under heavy arrivals and
large offerings of carried-over stock. Berries
were firm, for everything except Blackberries,
which were still In burdensome supply. There
was not much doing In Cltrua goods and, askU
from another advance In Mexican Limes, there
was nothing new to report -

NEW TORK, Aug. 4. â The exchar.ee had
quite a liveljr hour following the opening to
day and the market Fhowed more consist-,
ency and etrenpth during that period than at
any time during the week. A good effect was
prc-Huced on sentiment by the fact that such
substantial market leaders as Union Pacific
anc St. Paul were fully participant in the
nio^ement, to the exclusion of come of the
Iff-? influential specialties which have made
v; n.ucb of the market's prominence on recent
<ia;.s. But the effort to carry prices higher
Beemed to have exhausted itself with this'
KHiTf. and the later tradinsr reverted to the
c>_:-s ol ppi^ialties which may be moved with
much l^se effort. With the subsidence of the
Varly active fierr.and a dropping tendency In
the etajriard stocks became observable. The
heaviness Jiad ro more news to exDlain it
â¢ than did the early strength. The active buy
ing of the Cr>t hour was professedly based
on growing confidence in the grain crops, and
v w vas sought to convey the impression that
Â£ ' rmation was available to the buyers on
eUbect through the arrangements for se
\u25a0 curing sui'i'lies by the great cereal producing
. mpaHjeÂ©. The preference for less conspicuous
ir.arket leaders in the later movements turned
t.. *â¢: mo of the high priced railroad stocks
vtuch the . extraordinary market' course of
LtctanoÃl has served to make attractive.
'.\u25a0 rd irict-ji for CVntral Railroad, of New

Al the Opening sentiment was a. trifle bearish.
Initial quotations on September- being; off < a
shade to HÂ©%o at 84% c to 84Va0., Liberal
shipments from Argentina accounted partially
for the easier undertone at the opening. Clear

bulls was a decrease in ' receipts of wheat In
the Southwest.. At Kawwi City :and -St.

pared with C 20.200 bushels a year ago. __ A
report by a St. Louis trade paper regarding
.condition of: fall-sown wheat^ attracted i con
siderable attention and i constituted a bullish
influence. The report claimed that rains had
interfered with threshing of winter wheat in

ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION*
The lnvestlK.it lon of the nllegred Ir
regularities within the Slntc Hoard of
Dental liiamlnors hy the commission
yesterday opened n startling field of
possible fnvts which may bring: one
or more members of the board Into
very serious difflcultiea. The testimony
advanced proved to be the most, sensa
tional since the Kitting: of the commls
aion, und it digressed entirely from the
line of former Inquiry.
Dr. A. J. IlulliiiKcr, a practlc-Ing- den
tist, late of >nu Krancisoo but now of
Kins* County, axrore that Dr. S. M.
llrnÂ«*h, a brother dentist, with ofQces
at HOT aiarket street^ had lately stated
that be had "dus: np" to the State Board
and by so doing: had rrceived a tem
porary license. This money is alleged
to have been given by Dr. IlraNch to
Dr. P. S. Coke, a member of a- Market
street denial firm, and it is through him
that the member of the board is said
to have been approached. Attorney
Brann, representing? the "nolli! five,"'
Drs. Herrick, White. Balrd, Maybew '
and Howard, promised the oommiMslon
that he nould introduce evidence to
show that this money was received by
Dr. J. M. Dunn and that he granted the
license to Brasch.
This lime wltueMft grave the names of
five dentists nhom he alleges are prac
ticing without a license. Four of these
have offices ln San Francisco and the
other lives in Fresno Connty.
The matter is regarded by the State
commission as serious and it will be
thoroughly Investigated. "We shall probe
the thing to the bottom." said President
Pillsbury, "and find out where this al
leged fraud lies and who is responsible
for It. We shall not hesitate in doing
what we think is right, no matter who
it catches. If any member of the State
board is guilty of having received a bribe
or money for a service done in his official
capacity we want to know Itâ that's what
we are here for."
TESTIMONY COMES AS SURPRISE.
The testimony came as a complete sur
prise to most of the occupants of the
crowded room. The hush that fell as the
accusing words of the witness multiplied
into, vital sentences added a dramatic
touch to an investigation that has here
tofore been ordinary. The young gradu
ates pressed forward eagerly, yet anx
iously, fearing lest they should miss one
word. On one side of the table sat Dr.
Dunn, his fingers nervously playing with
a rubber all the time that the witness
talked. On the opposite side of the com
mission sat the "solid five," an expres
sion of satisfaction which they did not
wish to show appearing little by little on
their faces. Attorney Braun was impas
sable.
Dr. Huliinger was the last witness
called during the morning session. He
had told the commission the tenor of his
evidence before this sitting, and they
told him to go ahead and tell all he knew.
"Do you know any dentists who are
practicing ln this State without a li
cense?" was the first question.
# "Yes. sir," answered Dr. Huliinger.*
"How do you know this?"
'They told me themselves.".
"Who are they?"â this from the com
mission.

Dr. C. A. Hewett, 101 V* Grant avenue;
; Dr. S. M. Brasch, 997 Market street; Dr.

Fresno County."
i For an instant there was a hush â each
one in the room was trying to adjust
himself to the new circumstances. Then
came the questioning of the witness, .
sharp and fast, and between examina
tion and cross-examination, inquiries by
the commission and interruptions by the
attorneys the full story came out before
the searching Investigation.
"I have known ,Dr. Brasch for a con
siderable time," stated Dr. Huliinger,
"and he had frequently told me in his
office that he was not licensed and that
he was not afraid of the board. We were
quite friendly and I had sent a patient
up to his office to be treated. It was on

Otto Gertzen, an aged carpenter, was

the 3d of July that I met Dr. Brasch on
the street and he told me that he had a
license*
" 'How's that?' I asked him, for I knew
that as he was not a graduate from a
recognized institution nor had he. passed
the required time â¢ under a teacher, so
that he was not eligible to take the ex
aminations. 'What! Is it possible that
you have a license, when you told me
yourself that you were not eligible?'
DUG UP TO THE BOARD.
" 'Sure,' he said to me.- 'That's easy. I
merely dug up to the .State board,' at the
same time* making- a motion with hia
hand as of some one taking money, 'and
I got it all right.' He told me that Gov
ernor Pardee and two others .wrote to
the board and that he fixed it all right
by digging up. He told me that he went
to Dr. Dunn and that Dr. Dunn gave him
the temporary license. \
"A few days later I stepped into his of
fice on the way to pay my annual fee for
the renewal of the license, and I asked
him to let me see the license that waÂ»
granted him by Dr. Dunn. 'I have it at
my house,' he told me.
" 'Are you going to renew it', I- asked.
" 'No, what's the use. ' I am not afraid
of the board.' "

Dr. Dunn the lawful $5 and that he had

that or any other member of the, board/
He had also paid the lawful examination
fee of $25. He denied that he had told
Dr. Hullihger that he had "dug" /up" to
the board or that there was any irregu
larity in! the granting of his" temporary
license. He admitted that It was Dr.
Dunn to whom he had talked, but main
tained that he had paid nothing, that was
not strictly honest on the part of both
men. â¢ . â¢
It was at this point that Attorney
Braun rose and told the commission that
he had evidence to prove that Dr. Brasch
had paid $100 to Dr. Coke for; Dr. Dunn
and that Dr. Dunn had received the
money. \u0084 * .
DUNJT DEXIES IRREGULARITY. '
Dr. Dunn emphatically, denies that he
was guilty of any. irregularity In his ac
tions. He says that, he save the tempor
ary license, buf that ho did it according
to law. "Wheri Dr. Brasch came. to me,"
said Dr. Dunn, "and asked me to grant
him a temporary; license, I f asked- him to

recommendation for its selection unani
mous.
, Several property owners have ap
pealed to the board to keep the high
school near Its present location on Sut
ter street and on that account the Bell
property on Octavia street between Sut
ter and Bush is favored, but the Board
of Education does not appear to show
any particular desire for the last named
site.
It has been decided to utilize the old
Washington Grammar School building
for the opening of the new term.
Preparations have been made to house
the pupils in two buildings on adjoin
ing lots purchased by the city pending
the erection of the new building under
the bond Issue. As the preliminary
work has been delayed the old building
will be used until actual construction
has begun.
The Board of Education yesterday
held a conference relative to the ad
visability of recommending- the selec
tion of the north half of Western Ad
tlon block No. 370, on Hayes street be
tween Steiner and Pierce, as an alter
native site fcr the new Lowell High
school building proposed" to be built
under the bond issue.
The site named is regarded as a de
sirable one for the purposu in view
of the legal obstacles in the way of
the selection of the lot facing .Lafay
ette Park onOctavia street, ottered by
S. W. Holladay and others: The School
Directors had unanimously selected the
latter site as the most desirable, but
it. is feared that legal complications
will ensue owing to the fact that Oc
tayia street between Sacramento and
Washington is part of Lafayette Square
and its original .dedication as part of
tne park cannot be diverted to school
or other purposes.
The site on Hayes street fulfills the
desirable conditions of the Lafayette
Park site in that it is opposite Alamo
Square' and commands a magnificent
view of the city, standing as it does on
an eminence. .
' Sage, "Dealey & Company have al
ready offered to sell t&e lot to the city,
for $173,000; the lot is 412% - feet in j
length- by 137% feet in width/ the city
owning v lot in the middle of the site
30 by. 137.% feet.
The proximity of Alamo Square,
which is a four-block square and would
constitute additional playground for
the pupils, is another reason ih favor
of the selection of the Hayes-street
site. School Director Altmann is en
thusiastic in support of the site and
hopes to .prevail on his colleagues on
the Board of Education to make the
