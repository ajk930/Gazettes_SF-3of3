Si - rJiitKbDUKU, i\ov. 29. â hebastopol was to-day the scene of a desperate battle be
tween mutinous sailors and the troops in the forts on shore.
During the battle the town and the forts were bombarded by the gtms of the cruiser Otcha
koff, which now lies a burning wreck off Admiralty Point, its hull riddled with shot and its flaunt
ing red ensign of revolution hauled down..
Many of the crew of the Otchakoff were killed or wounded.
According to one report, the barracks of the mutineers were cirried jt>y;storm after the mu
tinous fleet, which is said to have numbered ten vessels, had surrendered, and the whole position is;
now in the hands of the troops : under the command of General Neptueff.
Owing. to the interruption of the telegraph* details of the battle are difficult to obtain ; but, % as
the Associated Press is authoritatively informed by the naval general staft to-night; the battlelwas be-

ACCEPTS CHALLENGE TO BATTLE."
:m: m The commander of the Otchakoff,. Lieutenant Schmidt, immediately accepted- the challenge,
replying with both batteries, one trained on 4 the town and the other on the Fort Alexander batteries
on the north shore. v "
Captain Zeilotti, aide-de-camp to Admiral Wirenius, chief of the naval general staff; says that
the latest dispatches received from Sebastopol showed that the Otchakoff was on fire and badly.rid
dled, with her revolutionary colors hauled down; but he* was unable to give more definite in
formation. \u25a0
According to a more detailed report, received from another source and purporting to come
from the Admiralty Department, the battle was begun at 3 o'clock this morning,' when Lieutenant
Schmidt opened lire from a fleet of ten ships, to which the northern batteries at Fort Alexander ar
tillery posted on the shore and several vessels which remained loyal replied.
MUTINEERS OJ\[ SHORE DEFEATED.
\u25a0 During the naval battle the mutinous sailors on shore, entrenched in the barracks, defended
their position with machine guns and rifles against the attacking infantry.' After an en<*a^ement
lasting two and a half hours, with the Otchakoff riddled and on fire and the cruiser Dnieper and an
other vessel sunk, Lieutenant Schmidt, who had been badly wounded, surrendered the entire squad
ron. The mutinous sailors on shore. surrendered to the Brest and Riclostok regiments.
According to this report, the Panteleiomon (formerly the-Kniaz Poteinkine)' was damaged be
low the water line, and a torpedo-boat is ashore on the rocks.
No details of the casualties or of the damage suffered by .the town are obtainable by the Ad
miralty, but owing to the confined space in which the action was fought it is improbable that the
town escaped without heavy damage.
The demands of. the mutineers are said to include the convocation, of a constituent assembly
and the complete realization of the liberties promised by the imperial Manifesto. ''%

WASHINGTON. Nov. 29. â Edwin V.

For a lonfr tino past the relations

ment hav<- not been thoroughly satis
lactory to the State- Department, which
regards it as cfsentiai to the conduct
of business between the two'govern
ments that their respective Ministers
shall be thoroughly acceptable at their
posts. It is said that in interviews
in the Havana Telegraph and a leading
New York newspaper the Minister af
lorded much encouragement to the
American colonists on tho Isle of Pines
n:id Americans at home who had prop
erty on the isle.
The administration had long been ad
visirjr these people to submit them
hvlvos to the Cuban Government, .as
kliowii in Secretary Root's letter to Mr.
Huynard, publiiihcd this inoi'ning.

legation oornpoiind throughout the fa
liioiis Hover siege of 1900, and was one
of the most prominent ngurcs in that
remarkable historical event. Mavinar a
military training, he was practically
put In command of one of the most im
portant features of the defense", and it
vas owing in no small part to his en
ergy and tactical ability that the le-
Kationers successfully resisted the
siege. Bculcrs was appointed Minister
to Cuba May -0. 1902.
ESdwin V. Morgan, the new Minister
to Havana, was appointed secretary to~
tlÂ»e United States Commission to the Sa
li.oan Islands in 1599. and participated
in the tormulation of important agree
ments, under which was effected the
dissolution of the tripartite Government
of Samoa and the division of the isl

pointed secrettj-y of Jegraiion at Seoul, |
Korea, and also Vice and Deputy Con
eul General there in J9OOL In the fol
lowing year he went to St. Petersburg

embassy, and when the first secretary,
Peirce, came to Washington aa Third
Assistant Secretary of State. Morgan
accompanied him as his confidential
oierk. He was appointed Consul at
Dalny in January. 1904. but was pre
vented by the war from proceeding to
â¢ his post, and in March, 1905, was made
Minister to Korea, a position which he

HITCH IN V THE DEAL
Eaihvay Not Considered as
Valuable an Acquisition
as It Was Thought tx) Be
NEW YORK, Nov. 29.â The following
statement â¢wagiissued to-day from; the of
fice of the president of the^Erie Railroad
after a meeting of the board of directors:
' It having appeared to the board of directors
of the Erie Company -that under existing, condi
tions the .purchase of the common stock of the
Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Company
might involve obligations on the part ol the
Erie Company -interfering; with, the future de
velopment of i Its -own â¢ rnur/ad, the < board cf
directors to-day voted unanimously to accept
the offer of 'J.i J P., Morgan, himself to ansumo
and complete the. purchase on his own account;
thus relieving. the'.Erie, Railroad from all costs,
charges and contracts in the matter.
Tb9 Erie board voted further to proceed..wlth
the sale. of its $12,000,000 convertible bonds as
heretofore authorized, the proceeds to. be used
as authorized under the general mortgage of
1003 in the improvement' and extension' to its
road. OOff f course, all stockholders who- ; bave
subscribed lo these bonds on the faith of the
Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton stock^belng
pledged thereunder will be released from their
subscriptions if they so deeire.
-': In the latter part of September it was
announced that J. P. Morgan & Co. had
bought from' the H.B. Hollins syndicate
the subscription rights of 46,000 of the 65,
000 shares of the Cincinnati, Hamilton and
Dayton! held in a voting trust at 160. A
few days later came, the announcement
that the Erie : had decided to purchase
this stock from the Morgan firm.
A trip of inspection' was made by Presi
dent Underwood and several of the vice
presidents,, accompanied by Russell Hard
ing of the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Day
ton. At that time, it was learned to-day,
the Erie men's suspicions 1 were aroused
that some of the companies controlled by
the Dayton road would not benefit v the
Erie. â¢ Morgan also looked | into these
properties after the sale. .The resuits of
these investigations, it was said, con
vinced Morgan and the Erie officials that
the carrying out of the bargain would do
great harm to the Erie. Altogether the
Erie men decided' the ."goods delivered
were hot up "to the sample." ,
Russain Jews, is fully appreciated in

McCURDY'S RESIGNATION.
lU-Healtb Given ai the Cause of His
â¢ 'Retirement.
fNEW YORK, Nov. 29.â Richard A.
McCurdy to-day resigned as president
of the' Mutual Life Insurance Company.
His "resignation was accepted by the
board "of trustees and Frederick Crom
well, treasurer of . the Mutual, was
named as his -temporary successor.
While no definite announcement was
made regarding the selection of a per
manent successor to McCurdy. It was
persistently reported that the" presi
dency, of the company had been offered
to James H. Eckels, who was Comptrol
ler of the Currency during the admin
istration of President Cleveland. Eck
els is now president of the Cpmmerclal
National Bank of Chicago.
.McCurdy's resignation was submitted
to the board of trustees In a letter, in
which he declared that his condition of
health imperatively demanded his im
! mediate retirement from active busi
ness. He had been dissuaded from sev
ering his connection .with the. company
last -June when he reached the age of
70"; years "only by ; the serious disturb
ance which previously .had arisen in
insurance affairs." Mn view of-this-con
ditlon he believed it his duty to remain
at 'his 'post;. >7 He found,.* ho-werer.'-.that:
he -had' overestimated his -physical
strength and -It was upon the â¢ advice
of his physicians that he tendered his
resignation." >.':;â¢-\u25a0.\u25a0 â¢-. â¢
The resignation was accepted unani
mously and the trustees passed a reso
lution in which they,- expressed - the
hope that "much needed rest may af
ford the relief requisite for such recov
ery as may be hoped for at his time
of life and assure him of their best
wishes for his/ future comfort and hap
piness in circumstances more congen
ial to" his present tastes and Inclina
tions."' "
The resignation of Justice Rufus W.
Peek ham of > the United States Supreme
Court as a trustee of the Mutual also
was . ptesented to the -board of trus
tees at to-day's meeting. The resigna
tion was accepted. "Justice Peckham

GIVES THE POWER
TO ALTER CHARGES
Fines Provided for Failure
of Eailroad Companies
to Obey the Orders Issued
of Commerce Commission
WASHINGTON. Nov.. 29.â The Senate
â¢ Committee on Interstate Commerce to
day received a copy of the rate bill pre
pared by the Interstate Commerce Com
; mission, to be submitted to Congress for
amendment to the Interstate commerce
law. The members of the committee who
Trero present at the session read the bill
to-dajr, but took no action and adjourned
until Friday. The bill is very extensive,
covering twenty-seven pages of type
%Titten sheets, and it proposes to amend
materlall'y the present law.
The bill defines the word "transporta
tion" 6.0 as to include all instrumentali
ties employed by the carrier, including
elevators, terminals, cars, whether owned
by the carrier or other parties, for re
frigeration, ventilation or other purposes,
end requires the carrier to furnish such
transportation upon reasonable request of
the shippers, publishing the total charges
for such transportation, as now required
by law.
It makes the through or joint rate
\u25a0where goods are shipped from one part of
the United States to another through a
foreign country subject to the control of
the Interstate Commerce Commission law,
and enforces the provtsien by making the
merchandise passing through the foreign
country from one part of the United
States and delivered in the United States
(subject to the customs duty at the fron
tier unless the through rate ts filed with
the Interstate Commerce Commission and
published -as required by law.
POWER TO FIX 2YEW RATES.
It authorizes the committee, through
Inspectors, to examine the accounts of
interstate railroads, forbids the keeping
of any other books except those pre
scribed by the commission and requires
railroads to make a great variety of re
ports in regard to all of their business.
It gives to the Interstate Commerce Com
mission the power, where rates and prac
tices of railways are complained of by
Individuals or corporations, including oth
er carriers or trade organizations or mu
nicipal corporations, as unjust or unrea
sonably discriminatory, to determine
upon full hearing what a just and rea
eonable rate or practice is, which should
take the ' place of . the rate or practice
Condemned by the commission. In dis
charging this duty the commission . is
given power "to flx a maximum rate, \u25a0 to
fix the differentials and to prescribe both
maximum and minimum rates, and to
Â« r.force the same when It may be neces
eary to prevent discrimination forbidden
by the bill, but not otherwise, and to
change the classification of tiny article,"
It also gives the commission the power,
in case it fixes a joint rate and the car
riers Interested are not able to agree on
Its apportionment, to make a supple
mental order apportioning the same.
A similar power is given to establish
through rates and Joint rates and. to fix
the terms and conditions under which
rates shall be operated, if the carriers
fail or refuse to agree upon the same.
It also provides that where the owner of
the proaerty transported renders any ser
vice in connection with the transporta
tion or furnishes any instrumentality
used, the commission rpay. on complaint,
determine what is a T-easonable charge
to be paid by carriers for such service
or Instrumentality. '
APPEAL TO THE COURTS.,
It provides for the collection In the
courts of overcharges found by the com
mission and the penalties for the failure
of the carriers to observe final orders
of the commission.
It provides that the final orders of "the
commission shall take effect within thirty
days from the time they are served on the
carrier, and. unless vacated by the courts
the orders will remain effective for the
rpace of one year.
In case the carriers complained of ob
ject to putting the orders of the commis
sion into effect, their right to have the
cane reviewed In the Circuit Courts of
the United States is provided for and -an
elaborate form of procedure Is outlined,
differing only In one Important particular
from the procedure now established for
the courts of the United States, namely,
that the chancellor- may, upon . notice to
both parties, extened the time In which
such orders shall take effect, not to ex
ceed sixty days from the date of the ser
vice of the orders on the carrier; and
that the court may also. If ltÂ«plainly ap
pears that the order is unlawful, but not
otherwise, suspend its operation within
the discretion of the court. An appeal
from the Circuit Court to the Supreme
Court without supersedeas Is allowed.
The bill provides that no costs shall be
allowed the petitioner in the Circuit
Court. In the cases appealed to the Cir
cuit Court the United States Is the de
fendant and If the proceedings are dis
missed the defendant shall have Judg
ment for its costs. The defense in these
proceedings will be conducted by; the. Gov
ernment through the District Attorney.
If a carrier does not comply with the
final crder of the commission or if the
officers or agents knowingly fail or neg
lect to obey the same, they shall forfeit to
the United States $5000 for each offense.

struck the German nation-like a thunder

"The^Kaiser's reference to the * interna

confronted by a grave crisis. ' The strong
undercurrent Of resignation \u25a0in Emperor
"William's words is remarkable. It is as
if the Kaiser had said : 'We. have \u25a0 tried
to do everything to.appease Great Britain,
but in vain.' German attempts to show
politeness to- : London and to "convince
King Edward that the fatherland is nurs
ing, no .hostile 'plans fhave called \ forth

the well-considered affront of -declining,

PRESIDENT FOE
OF BOSS RULE
WASHINGTON, Nov. 29.â President
Roosevelt has declared himself against
"bossism'% In New York City politics.
This declaration he has made emphati
cally in letters to personal and political
friends regardlng'.the selection of the
president of the Republican committee
qf_New York: County.. /He deprecates
the. Interference" of "outsiders -In the
politics of the county and has indicated
his view i that nothing ought to be done
by such outsiders that might be con
founded with dictation.
The has discussed the sit
uation in. New York frankly with sev
eral of his callers and has written some
letters to those directly interested in
the New York Republican organization.
In these conversations and letters he
-as indicated his present intention re
garding ; the situation In. New York
County. He has suggested the names
of 'five or six" mcii, any one of whom,
in his judgment, would prove an ac
ceptable president of the New York
County, committee; buthe has let it be
known that he has not attempted ' to
dictate the election of any candidate for
county chairman of. proclaim his choice
to any person who has approached him
on the subject.
He has expressed an opinion, as a
citizen, however, that whoever, is chosen
chairman should be a man of the high
est character and reputation and should
possess the \u25a0 necessary independence to
make ft certaiu that he would conduct
the affairs of the Republican organiza
tion In sNew "York County on a .high
plane -of efficiency /and integrity .with
out regard to any boss or any machine.
"President -Roosevelt has not declared
himself In favor of the selection of
Representative Herbert Parsons or Rep
resentative . Olcott or - anybody . else as
the president of ; the New York ; County
committee,' although" both Parsons and
Olcott were included In the list of men,
any one" of : whom, the President be
lieves, would make an acceptable head
of ; the committee.'

wound inflicted by Policeman Robert
Pautz early this " morning, : a t*baref oot"
burglar, who broke into a residence . in
the vicinity of Tenth street and , Grand

- Not since "the capture of Kiniry, thÂ«
burglar who looted many ot the fashion
able residences of the city last year and
received a life sentence in the State's
prison, have the police had such a des
perate criminal to deal with.
Four bullets from a revolver were
fired at Policeman Pautz by the bur
glar, each barely missing him. Five
shots were fired by the policeman, one
or 'more bullets, it Is believed, taking
effect. * BHHili
For a distance of several hundred feet

St; te Hospital h> Adirondacks Shows Encourw
â¢gtng FisÂ«res~.|os Patients Discharged.
PThe trustees of the New York
ate Hospital for Incipient Pul-
monary Tuberculosis in the Adiron-
dacks have issued their completed
; statistics for the first year, which is
as follows: There were admitted
207 patients, more than half of
whom were incipients. There were
no deaths. Of the 105 patients dis-
; charged, fifty-two were apparently
recovered. Twenty-six arrested cases
are reported. Sixteen improved,
while eleven left without any im-
; provemeat The treatment consists
, mainly of outdoor air, wholesome
'food and rest. Patients have three
full meals and two or 'three lun-
cheons a day, and 90 of the 105
.gained ah average of 10.57 pounds
each. This is certainly most en-
\u25a0 couraging and shows that incipient .
consumptives at least can be cured.
There is another treatment perhaps

In Presence of I,

BY SALLY SHARP.
A tender, regard; for brides has the
gruff old storm king, for twice" during
the week has he whisked his clouds
away, that no tear might drop from
heaven upon ..he happiest of women â â¢
as brides proverbially are. .'[ ..\u25a0\u25a0â¢' i
Yesterday the wedding at San Mateo
of Miss Mary Elizabeth Kohl, daughter
of the late Captain and "Mrs. William
Kohl, and ( Evans â¢ Searles Pillsbury
promised to be rather a damp affair.
But a half hour before noon â the hour
set for the nuptials â the clouds parted,
the sun came forth as If to impart a j
blessing, and wh^fi the. bridal party,|
halted at the portals -of . St. Matthew's i
every tree and flower, and shrub shim
mered forth a thousand colors of greet
ing.
Within the, sun shot its rays through
the stained Windows, that filled the
church with a ruby light.
From, the : rafters swung masses oÂ£
feathery asparagus fern and about
every sconce and chandelier.
The chancel,- lighted with many
tapers, wa's abloom with white and yel
low chrysanthemums,' flanked with
ferns and- waxen palmsâ thousands of
blossoms -were" there about the lovers
as they knelt before the Rev. V.William 1
Parsons to be made one. \u25a0 ;
. Promptly at the angelus hour.^the
bride appeared/unattended, looking
regal in her robe of ivory; satin and
rose ' point lace, a lull tulle ;veil en
veloping her from coiffure to train. On
her arm . she carried a 'great shower
bouquet of lilies of the valley and
asparagus fern. ," '. .
Mr. Pillsbury?
Just the ordinary rig of a well-groomed
bridegroom. .
Ie remained for Peter Martin and Wal
ter Hobart to take first honors - among
the gentlemen for /gorgeous * raimentâ
each Jn \u25a0 black-and-white "checker-board
trousers, gray spats j' and gray -cravats,
o'ertopped. of course, with frock coats
and silk hats. But Mr. -Martin's waist
coat of tan polka-dot lent him an espe
cial distinctionâ the swaggerest get-up in
town, or out. . * .
~The tremulousness of ; the weather had
no apparent effect upon the gownery of*
the women, who more than filled the little
chapel. Many of the. guests had come
from town, and many, others from Bur-,
lingameâ in fact; the whole Burlingame
contingent was present, superbly capari

CELEBRATION OF A GOLDEN
WEDDING ANNIVERSARY
Joy Reigns in Home of General Pratb
â¢ "General and Mrs. William H. Pratt cele
brated : the fiftieth anniversary of their
marriage yesterday and la3t evening at
their residence, 1724 Stelner street. On
the r occasion 'they were surrounded by
as many of their, children and grandlchll
dren as could be present and at a recep
tion received the congratulations of many
friends who visited them. The house was
beautifully: decorated.
General Pratt is one of the ( early pio
neers of California and has been identified
with Its growth and development during
his fifty-seven years spent In his adopted
State. On the 22d of December, 1848, be
fore attaining his majority, General Pratt
left New York, crossed r the isthmus, and
embarked on. the steamer California in
February, 1849, arriving at San Francisco
on the 2Sth day. of the same month; the
California beings the first steamer that
passed through the Golden Gate.
He soon returned to New Tork, leaving
again for San Francisco with merchan
dise, which ' was destroyed â¢in the great
June ; fire of 1850. He became engaged in
mining enterprises In which he was very
successful, "became- the- owner, of a tele^
graph Hne-and-added to : his -other enter
prises a banking business,

THANKS TO-DAY
Loyal Americans Observe the
Custom of Forefathers.
HISTORIC IN CALIFORNIA
To-dnr all loj ill Americans ttIII celebraic Thanksgiving; viltk turkey
dinners and other feast*. Ever since the cnotom mas Introduced by the
I'orltans tn 1621 the day baa been the occasion of solemn observance . nil
over the United States. Every year in the days of sold California has
been remarkable for some unusual sort of a demonstration,' but even in
the time of strife the residents of tlie Golden slate alvrays observed
the day tn a fitting manner. s
To-day i* the one on which the great
majority of Americans pause In their
mad vtampede for riches and render
thanks to heaven for the blessings and
the benefits it has bestowed on the great
Western republic during the year.
Thanksgiving is a true American feast
6ay, Introduced by the Puritan ancestors
In 1621. and religiously handed down from
generation to - generation till It has
evolved from Â« mere custom of a few
\u25a0weather-beaten pioneers to a national
feast day, in wh'ch the great American
people unite as one to display their grat
itude, -
Thanksgiving is a day of peace and
cuiet celebration, yet during the last few
years it hae been the occasion of many a
dreadful and heartrending accident and
calamity. Nearly every year the dove of
peace has been supplanted by the grim
angel of death and mourners have taken
the places of thankful citizens who but a
few hours before were seated around the
festal board, little thinking of any dread
event.
livery American knows the purpose of
Thanksgiving day. but not every one is
familiar with the circumstances which
brought about the first Thanksgiving
feast the world ha* known. It happened
in 1621. near Plymouth Rock, Mass.. the
landing place of the Pilgrim fathers, and
It was enjoyed by a small group of the
Puritans, who but a short time before
that Joyous moment were all but starving
to death.
PURITAXS CELEBRATE DAY.
\ William Bradford, then the Governor
cf the, small colony, seeing that death
and starvation were staling the members
of the colony in the face, on a bleak day,
the last Thursday In November, gathered
about him half a dozen of his trusty fol
lowers and bade them go forth into the
woods &nd seek provisions for the colo
nist*. â¢ They, set out on their perilous er
rand, little- thinking that it was to be
come \u25a0 a historical event to be handed
down ior centuries.
Forjtune smiled on the little "band of
huntsmen and ere nightfall they returned
to camp, well provided with wild tur
keys. Then the little colony sat down to
partake of the welcome feast. But be
fore they even thought of satisfying their
appetites these zealcus Puritans knelt on
the roow-covered ground and there
thanked God for his goodness in provid
ing for them this cheer on the bleak and
barren shores of a new empire.
For many years the Puritans were pro
vided with food and shelter in plenty.
They firmly believed that their prayers
to the Almighty had been heard and from
that time their faith In the divine power
was unshaken." But a few years later
a fearful drought threatened the colony.
This time it was in the middle of June,
five years after the first Thanksgiving
feast.
PRAYERS AGAIX ANSWERED.
Not a drop of rain had fallen in the
State of Massachusetts for many moons,
end nothing but ruin eeemed In store for
the Puritans. Again the little band got
together and again prayeft were offered
to heaven for relief. And, strange to say,
they were granted, for rain began to fall
before the prayers had yet ended, and
what looked like a season of disaster was
transformed into one of plenty.
But the latter could hardly be termed a
rÂ«?gelar Thanksgiving offering, for the
Puritans never looked upon it as such.
They still regarded the first prayer of
fering and subsequent delivery by the
power of heaven as the real Thanksgiv
ing. And each year they solemnly ob-
Berved this feast. It gradually began to
spread to the other colonies, and In a
short time the custom of giving thanks
on the last Thursday of November was
regarded as a sort cf national practice,
though no law had "ever been made creat
ing it such. . â¢
It was George Washington who made
the first national proclamation regarding
the 'giving of thanks on the last Thurs
day in November. In the year 1795 Wash
ington issued an edict setting apart
Thanksgiving day as one of rest from
toil and one of general rejoicing. The
merchants were urged to close their
stores and men of all walks of life re
quested to observe that day as the one
en which the entire nation might express
gratitude.
PROCLAMATION BY WASHINGTON.
From the issuing of that first proclama
tion Thanksgiving day was generally cel
ebrated all over the then United States.
Strange as it may seem, the solemn oc
casion was observed in California even
before -the thought of glittering gold
flashed through the minds of the few
who then roamed the hills and valleys of
the far Western land.
On the last Thursday in November,
1547. a' little band .cf â¢ pioneers had gath
ered together in whaf , Is now known as
San Francisco. They all remembered the
occasion, and with their usual custom
tn'ey "^congregated In a small hut, and
before partaking of their humble feast
thanked God for his goodness, then' sat
down to the repast- That was the first
Thanksgiving dinner ever eaten in the
Golden State.
No 'official record was kept of the
Thanksgiving services in California the
following year, but in ISI9, the year after
the discovery of gold, General Rlley,
then the military governor of the pest,
issued a Thanksgiving proclamation. It
was heard by all the miners and adven
turers, and they gathered in their huts
and partook of the 'feast, though thou
sands cf miles from civilization and their
homes.- The flrst official proclamation
was made by Governor Burnett in 1850.
Only those who use it
. know the luxury of it.

And then came the dark days for the
State, when riot and murder and lawless
ness were at their beieht. The Vigilance
Committee was kept busy hanging | mur
derers and thieves, and the good citizens
\u25a0were all on the alert lest they be mur
dered as they "slept. Even Governor John
son did not think about Thanksgiving in
1856, and Instead of proclaiming the na
tional holiday he issued a statement in
one of the papers declaring' the city of
Ban Francisco to be in a state of riot.
KIXG URGES CELEBRATION.
On the same day Thomas Starr King,
the noted divine, came out with an edi
torial reminding the good citizens that
it was Thanksgiving. He urged "them
to celebrate the day as it should -be
celebrated and to give thanks to God
for all he had (lone, for them. And,
strange to say, ih'is edict carried more
weight than the Governor's, for the
miners forgot their battles and their
labors on that memorable Thanksgiv
ing day and feasted Instead of fought.
Thanksgiving was not a memorable
day in California for a few years after;
ward. In 1800 the regular proclama
tion . was ( issued, but the "celebration
was hardly a joyous one, nor one of
thanks, for at that time a bloody war
threa ened the country and dissension
rent the ranks of the people of the
State, for many of them were in favor
of Southern ideas, while others were
loyal to the Union and ready to fight In
its cause.
A few days after the Thanksgiving
festivities in California the war broke
out, with the secession of South Caro
lina. During the next four, years
Thanksgiving in the Golden State was
but a name, as in many other States.
The war was on and riot and desolation
swept the broad land, where but a few
years before peace reigned supreme.
Sinoe that time accidents and con
flagrations have often marked the day
when the people 'of the great United
States have, been ready to offer up their
thanks for all the blessings bestowed
upon them. During the last â¢ ten years
or more accidents on Thanksgiving day
hare been frequent and the loss. of life
or the loss of property has often marked
tne day as one of mourning instead of
one of celebration and joyousness.
WRECK IX MASSACHUSETTS.
In 1894 in old Massachusetts, the
scene of the first Thanksgiving cele
bration, an awful accident marked the
day that centuries before the Pilgrim
fathers had made one of national fame.
A train bearing the Southbridge foot
ball players to Worcester was wrecked
and five of the players were killed out
right. Many others were maimed for
life and the whole State mourned.
When the citizens of Oakland .were
preparing to celebrate' Thanksgiving
day. in 1897 in a fitting manner the
pretty little Church of the Bacred Heart
was burned to the ground in the still
ness of the preceding night. How the
lire started no one knew, nor did any
one ever find out. The conflagration
threatened many homes in the- vicinity
and cast a damper on the day.
The great Baldwin Hotel fire occurred
on the morning of Thanksgiving, 1898.
As the guests lay sleeping shortly after
the hour of midnight the hotel was en
veloped in flames and one of the most
famous fires in the history- of the city
soon raged In all Its fury. Two lives
were lost and many persons were in
jured. Hundreds were left homeless by
the disaster, and this in a measure made
that Thanksgiving day a bleak one for
San Franciscans.
But the most appalling and horrible of
all accidents that ever cast gloom over,
the fair city was the collapse of the glass
works at Sixteenth and Folsom streets
in 1900, during the progress of . the Stan
ford-California football* game' \u25a0in , the
grounds opposite. Twenty-two: men and
boys lost their lives In that awful disas
ter. \u25a0 :...'\u25a0 â¢
WHOLE CITY IN MOURNING.
The Injured and dying 'were taken oft
the hot. molten furnaces on to which they
were hurled from the roof of the factory,
and the cries of pain could be heard for
blocks around. The morgue and the hos
pitals were filled with the dead and dying
and the whole: city went into mourning
for the unfortunate. -
Many a" home was broken up by that
disastrous accident and many a family
left without a loving father or brother.
So intent on watching the progress of the
great football game were most of the
spectators that they did not ' even ' know
that an accident had happened, \u25a0 much
less that scores of human beings were
suffering . tortures and . others were . lying
cold in death; who but a few minutes,be
fore were enjoying the game with never
a thought of â¢ what was about to happen.
The -following' year a quarrel among
the Chinese highbinders of the city-re
sulted in a fierce fight. This dldnot con
cern the Christian residents of s the!city,! city,
as much as former accidents on the' great
day of peace, yet the papers '.'were : full
of it and every one was talking of; the
cold blooded murder of the two Chinamen
as they slept peacefully In their beds.'}
A fatal train wreck near Benlcla
marked Thanksgiving night, 1903. A heav
ily laden freight train crashed into; an
engine ' near the Junction ' of : that town,
and Engineer Henry Foster, and Fireman
Henry : .-W, : Davis were hurled ; to \u25a0. death.'
Many others were Injured in the catastro
phe" and the Thanksgiving celebration of
the little town was turned 'lnto' a day of
sorrow and mourning. \u25a0

Knowledge of Explosive
That Hurt Their Parents
All day yesterday " the Police Depart
ment'investigated the mysterious explo
sion!' that wrecked ; : the i frame building
at 10 St. Charles^ place at an early: hour,
yesterday morning, , and ;;. the ; result [of
their labors has brought them ; near, to . a
gang of saf ecrackers,'- to . whom, : it '\u25a0\u25a0 is al
leged, the explosive "> was ,t, to > be delivered
by the Bellingers.' Isador Seliinger and
his wife, Augusta, both of whom nar
rowly escaped death in the explosion that
blew them through the' east wall of their
home, were" removed to the German' Hos
pital yesterday from V the -Central Emer
gency Hospital. ' Both have sustained ' se
vere injuries, but their lives are . not in
danger. . ' .
Benjamin and Harry Bellinger, the two
sons, who are 'suspected ."of having com
pounded the explosive, Vwere arrested and
held at the City. Prison '' on \u25a0> the detinue
book. Detectives Taylor, Braig and Mul
cahy, 1 who have been r ; working indefatlg
ably on the case, smce the explosion,
questioned the youths closely, but -were
unable to obtain a' clew. Both boys : deny,
the presence of an explosive, but cannot
explain why . they were found . ~fully
dressed when the police i arrived, while
the bed they occupied and from 'which
they were supposed to. have been .hurled
by tho . explosive " was found shattered to
Pending the elder. Selllnger's recovery at
the hospital the detectives will carefully
examine his record. According to the j>o
lice there is but one- way of accounting
for the presence of . nitjro-glycerine in' the
house, and that is that it was therefor
the purpose of' supplying safecrackers.
The discovery of this gang brings the po
lice closer to much-wanted offenders,
who will probably be apprehended to-,
day. . : ,
It has been the custom for safecrack
ers, when about ' to do : a 'Job, i to procure
the materials for^ 1 making ; the explosive
in different drug stores, so that the.buy
ing of the chemicals would not arouse
suspicion. The mixing^ however,' is such
a dangerous â¢ task that- the crooks have
given over the making of it, and are only
too willing to pay a high r price for the
explosive J intact.
- The business of selling explosives to
crooks has become highly : profitable to
"fences" and ; go-betweens, and ; the allur-'
ing prices obtained are considered worth
the danger. The police are working along
the line that some of the Seliinger family
mixed the explosive, knew of its location
and were , preparing to sell It to safe
crackers. Evidence as . to .: which . one of
the Selllngers knew of the explosive may
be brought forward to-day. The presence
of nitro-glycerine . indicates | that \u25a0a ' safe
cracking job was about to be done and
within a ' short time, as nitro-glycerine is
a dangerous article to , keep ; on hand.
The actual cause of the : explosion- is
still a mystery, but the - volatile nature
of ' nitro-glycerine makes it. probable that
a change in temperature or a slight-con
cussion was responsible.' :

DECLARES LAW
IS NOT VALID
Attorney Melvin C. Chapman
Says Child-Labor Provi
sions Are Unconstitutional
MEASURE IS NOT LEGAL
Says Orphans 3lay Starve if
Letter of Statute Is Car
ried Out by Officials
OAKLAND, Nov. Â».â The constitution
ality of the child-labor law. enacted by
the last legislature, was attacked by At
torney M. C. Chapman this morning when
the case of Fred Becker, a r well-known
meat merchaiU. was called in the Police
Court. Prosecuting Attorney Leach prac
tically agreed that Chapman was right,
but at his request the case was continued,
60 that the attorneys for the State Labor
Bureau rr.ifehi be heard.
Chapman recited that Henry Thompkins
â¢was allesed to have hean killed at Beck
er s irseat market and that he was alleged
to hav^ bc*n only 13 years old. Then
be declared that the law was unconstitu
tional In us nature, because it did not
refer to all minors, simply applying to
minors with a parent or parents. To
make his point stronger. Chapman re
ferred to the fact that no one had the
right to grant orphans the right to labor
within the present law. He declared that
orpnaxis were not under control of the
6uperiritendent o* schools and that the
law made no reference to jruardians,
therefore an orphan might be compelled
to starve.
"The law is not general in its nature,
in that it does not apply to all minors."
caid Chapman, "a-id therefore it is not
\u25a0within the provisions of the constitu
tion." , V^ ;\u25a0*\u25a0Â£'-\u25a0

BLOOD CLOT EE&IOVED
FROM BRAIN OF SIMS
Successful Operation May
Save Life of Injured
Autoist,
OAKLAND. Nov. 23.â 1t was thought
last night thet the life of romance that
J. Fletcher Sims had been leading was
about to be closed when he was thrown
from his automobile in Fruitvale and re
ceived an injury of the ekull that was at
first thought to be a fracture at the base
of the brain. To-day, however, an opera
tion was performed by Dr. O. D. Hamlln,
assisted by Drs. J. M. Kane and C. E.
Curdts, " and a blood clot was removed
from the brain. Now the patient has an
even chance for recovery, and this even
ing it was reported at the Providence
Hospital that he was improving.
Fletcher Sims has been a welUknown
character in Oakland for several years,
and the fact that he has been leading a
dual life has been an open secret. Several
years ago a woman killed herself In San
Francisco and left a picture of Sims at
her feet and a note bidding him farewell.
That was the beginning of 'his romances,
which have been more than fall to the
lot of the ordinary individual. He was
married at the time, and to-day he has
a luxurious home at 2421 Warring street,
Berkeley, where his wife and two daugh
ters. Ethel and Myrtle Sims, reside.
There was trouble in the Sims family
at Berkeley and he and his wife sepa
rated. Since then he has maintained an
establishment in Alameda and in the En
clnal City has lived under the name of
F. M. Williams. :* :

Aged Charles H. King Stops Telephone Work
men From Putting Up an Unsightly Pole.
MILUONAIRB WHO GAVE BATTLE TO- WORKMEN ' AND : : FIN'ALLT COM- \u25a0
PELLED THE TELEPHONE COMPANT TO COME TO TERMS A 8 TO WHERE
A POLE SHOULD BE PLACED IN FRONT OF HIS PROPERTY. . -
\u25a0 OAKLAND, Xovl 29. â Angered at the
repeated attempts of the Pacific States
Telephone Company to net a pole in
front of his property at a. point where
he was determined that no pole should
stand, Charles H. King, millionaire and
pioneer of Oakland, and his son, Josepn
H. King, yesterday engaged in a hand-to
hand encounter with the emplpyes of the
company, who were digging the hole
where the pole was to be set, and after
a battle lasting nearly an hour forced
the corporation to change the location
of the pole to a point designated by
him. \._-*v "-\u25a0,.?
So' enraged did the aged capitalist be
come . over the disregarding of hts
wishes by the company that he seized a
pick and shovel and,*" aided by his son.
hurled the earth back into the excava
tion made by the company's workmen
as fast aa they threw It out.
At one point in the encounter blood
shed was narrowly averted, when one
of the telephone men attempted to takÂ«Â»
the pick from Mr. King to prevent him
from interfering with the work of the
men. Swinging "the Implement above
his head, the white-haired capitalist or
dered the man to stand back on penalty
of receiving the point of the pick in
his body. Finding that, he could .'not
get the pick without a struggle, the man
decided "that he was paid to work, but
not to ' fight," and went back to his
labors. : . J \u25a0
Finally, finding that he waa making
no progress In the completion of his
work, the foreman in charge of. i the
crew of telephone men ordered his men
to cease work on tho excavation and
went to the office of the company "to
consult his superiors. By this time Mr.
King had sent for his attorney, and,
finding, that the capitalist was. deter
mined to prevent the erection of the
pole at any cost, the officials of the com
pany decided to i erect the pole at the
point designated by Mr., King.;. â¢ ;\u25a0\u25a0;- \u0084
The . trouble which culminated in : the
encounter began yesterday morning, 1
when- King found the telephone men at
work digging a hole for.; a J pole ] directly
in front of a # gate to his ; property at

OAKLAND, Nov. 29.-rCharges ' have

rectors I have j adopted a resolution' call
ing for the preparation of a report on

fered free transportation by the South
ern Pacific ( Company to send delegates
to the convention, instructed I; in - ; the
railroads' interests. This offer was re
fused. .But Arper. claims, the Board of
Trade accepted a similar tender.',
> From Ithe Board of Trade comes -fiat
denial >-'of - the accusations. Edwin
Steams, secretary of the board; 1.. A.
Beretta and Hugh Hogan were the
degelates. Steams said the charges were
false, that $400 -had. been appropriated
by the "board for expenses, and that
they were not instructed. ' Steams de
clared that nearly, 600 delegates bolted
the convention, among . them being the
Board of Trade representatives,; as well
as George Scott, "i Arthur R.~ Briggs "and
other men from San Francisco.
H. C. Capwell,' president of the Board

Several Members of Board
: Believe r Thai Bond Should
Be Given ;t6; t6 Municipality
Special DUpatch.to Toe call.
' SAUSALITO, Nov. 23.â The application
of v F.:* L,r Evans.' who is 'promoting the
California- and Empire Railroad
Company â¢\u25a0-, for a\ steam railroad franchise
over Railroad avenue was laid over this
evening by the Board of Town Trustees.
Evans * asked that " the franchise be given
without any consideration other than his
agreement . to construct 200 miles of road
from Sausalito to Aituras, Modoo County,
within three, years. No other guarantee
was offered that he Is acting in good
f aith. ; I The Board" of Trustees realizes the
value of tide land avenue and some of the
members are in favor of granting a
franchise provided Evans executes a
$50,000 guaranty bond. Other members
believe that a bonus should be paid for
the franchise.
All the members of the board were
present except Trustee Hughes, who was
ill. ' Evans was ; accompanied by his at
torneys, Baggett and Sheridan, of San
Francisco and many prominent Sausallto
ftes were present. In his report upon the
legality of granting a franchise*. Town At
torney Meldon stated that the board had
the power to grant the franchise to. an
individual and could require a bond of
good 1 faith.* The franchise, x however,
couid not be placed in escrow, but could
be revoked at \u25a0 the pleasure of the board.
The. report .was placed on file.
Evans in presenting a draft of a fran
chise prepared by his. attorneys said:
"I present this drafted franchise with
a blank description for you to alter or
amend after your attorney has cartfully
digested it ao we may overcome any ob
jections. We wish to v protect invidluals
and the town as well as ourselves."
The Town Clerk read the franchise and
a lengthy discussion followed. Archie J.
Treat said the growing scarcity of avail
able deep water facilities had centered
the eyes of approaching railroads upon
the value of the water front and he did
not believe Sauattflto should give away the
water front property for a song. He be
lieved the municipality should control the
water front.
x Town Trustee W. J. Martin in dis
cussing the application said:
"The citizens of Sausalito are familiar
with Mr. ', Evans and his plans. .We ad -
nrire him for his energy and he is entitled
to every courtesy due a free-born Ameri
can and to a careful consideration of his
application. He has shown us that we
have a valuable tide land avenue. . The
granting of this franchise wouid block
any other road from coming . in .If Mr.
Evans secures j all : he asks." ;Otlr -water
front, is -of r great value: and HJ :Wl only
right that a. substantial guranteed. bonus
be forthcoming. I am opposed to any
hasty action and unless Sausalito receives
some adequate compensation, the fran
chise should not be granted."
â¢; Attorney W. T. Baggett spoke in behalf
"of granting the franchise and suggested
that the Trust ses Introduce It to-night to
facilitate matters. He also spoke upon
the absurdity of demanding a bondguar
anteelngV good faith. He was followed
by Trustee Plstolesi, who j opposed grant
ing the franchise unless a bond guaran
teeing good faith was executed. "
After: much discussion the Town .Sur
veyor was. Instructed to set stakes show
ing the ' boundary lines of â¢ the \u25a0 water
front. " ' '
i Trustee Martin's motion to have the en
tire matter referred to the committee of
thewhole was then carried and the meet-
Ing adjourned.

Contempt for Printing

APPEAL TO BE TAKEN
His Constitutional Right
of Exemption From Arrest
During Session Invoked
DENVER, Nov. 23.â The Supreme Court
to-day held United States Senator Thom
as Patterson to be in contempt of court
for printing certain cartoons and edi
torials in his two newspapers and fined
him $1000, and directing that he be com
mitted to jail until the fine is paid. Sub
sequently the court ordered a stay of ex
\u2666cutlon for sixty days pending an appeal
t>y Senator Patterson to the Supreme
Court of the United States.
Shortly before noon the court announced
that the Patterson case would be called,
ar.d directed that an attachment be Issued
for the Senator when he failed to ap
pear. Later the Senator came into court
In company with the court bailiff. He
protested against the service of an at
tachment, claiming that he was not at
tempting to avoid making an appearance,
but the court reminded Senator Patterson
that he had agTeed to appear at a cer
tain time. Considerable discussion and
controversy followed as to Just what had
been agreed to between Patterson's at
torneys and the court, and Senator Pat
terson declared emphatically that he
vould go to Jail rather than pay the fine
imposed. His attorneys also informed the
court that Senator Patterson would ex
ercise the constitutional right as a United
States Senator to claim exemption from
arrest while Congress was In session and
thereby have set aside the judgment of
the court in order that he might be en
able to be present when Congress con
vened next week.
Further discussion followed, and the
Senator told the court that if a stay of
execution was issued he would hasten an
appeal to the Supreme Court of the
United States, and if that body refused
to take cognizance of his case or decided
the case against him he would pay the
fine. The court agreed to that and issued
the order accordingly. Chief Justice
Gabbert announced at the conclusion of
the Patterson case that the court would
hand down the formal opinion in the case
within a few days.

ment was also overruled- and" District

arose, but remained standing by the
side of the table occupied by his, coun-i
eel and did not approach directly in

"You have been present' during;- the

of a proper bond, operate as a stay of
execution of sentence. This, was al
lowed by the 'court, who anounced that
the bond for $5000 offered by Senator
Burton as prlncipal--arid.R.:C., Kerens
of St. Louis as surety was approved.
* Senator Burton immediately left. the
Federal building, after? refusing to
make any statement for .publication,

>of defendant to Be Ee
ieasedf From County Jail
The trial of . George D. . Collins : for per
jury - began In earnest yesterday after
' noon 'before Judge' Lennon. The morning
was devoted ':. to securing thÂ© (remaining
! three jurymen, and after, examining many
the following three . were aelected: George
D.> Starr, :; who - llyea -at r," the . Westgate
apartments on Taylor atreet ;;M. B.* Cohn
of 1362 Ellis street and Paul F. Kingston
of 224 yallejo street. V r 1
- Lennon I opened \u25a0 tha afternoon's
session; by Instructing -the â¢ jury 'aa to
what \u25a0 they must do. . District -Attorney
\u25a0 Bylngton outlined the ; casa and . told the
jury . the offense of which \u25a0 he . lntended to
prove the defendant guilty. ; . V, \u25a0 ; \u25a0â.-\u25a0\u25a0' .
Collins made a strong , plea.' for ; his lib
erty. *.Hs maintained that* if hV were kept
In the custodyj-of the Sheriff he would be
deprived of the right -to properly defend
himself, inasmuch as he would have no
opportunity, to- interview i his witnesses,
and consult his counsel. He also bitterly
complained "of the meals they serve at
the County Jail and expressed. his dislike
for the surroundings of the Broadway re
sort. . The District Attorney objected to
releasing * the defendant ; and T Judge Len
non refused to grant Collins his liberty,
reminding him of his previous flight. The
Judge told him, though, that It was with
in "the power of the Sheriff -to grant cer
tain privileges. ..\u25a0', ._ .'
.: The , only witness called during thÂ© day
was Charles C; Morris, an attache of. the
County Clerk's office," who swore as to the
identity of certain papers and documents.
Several hours of the afternoon were,de
voted by defense and prosecution to argu
ing whether Judge Graham had ' Jurisdic
tion or, not in ordering the defendant" to
pay Charlotta Newman Collins alimony.
Judge Lennon, ; by * the . consent of both
sides, I agreed to excuse the jurors before
they . began "their arguments,* and they
were ordered to be present Friday morn
ing, when the trial Is to be renewed.
Collins held that according to an act by
the last Legislature, when an amendment
was made to section 137 of the Civil Code,
Judge -Graham went beyond the author
ity-vested; In him as a Superior Judge to
order him to pay Charlotta Newman Col
lins .alimony -after desertion of twenty
one days. He maintained that according
to . the present law a husband was not
compelled , to pay alimony until a year
after 'desertion. Attorney Hiram John
son for the prosecution held the negative
and recited many decisions and authori
ties.;
The point will be further discussed Fri
day morning.

LEST WE FORGET.
THE adoption of a day of Thanksgiving m this country, was the
act of the 'Pilgrims, shortly after landing oh the -wild coast of
New England. They had but little of the material comforts -of
life to be thankful for. Behind them was a stormy ocean they had
passed in a frail ship. Before them was the wilderness peopled by
wild tribes. Considered in all of its material aspects,* it was one of
the least promising beginnings for a nation known to history. But
they had the. spirit of thanksgiving for the privilege of taking up a
hard task, and facing novel dangers and difficulties. /\u25a0 \u0084
The additions that came to their ranks, the hew recruits known
as the Puritans, were in many important respects different from the
Pilgrims in whose wake they â¢followed.' They forgot the purpose
that was carried on board the Mayflower by the small band of Eng
lish men and women who had been in spiritual exile in Holland
until they had as their master motive the finding of a place where
freedom of conscience might be *en joyed and made the foundation
of civil and religious liberty. The Puritans who followed them, and
who are. often mistaken as a part of them, sought religious freedom
for themselves, but brought the spirit of religious intolerance for all
who differed from them in their religious ideas.
When the spirit that was in the first Thanksgiving, had com
pleted its work in the foundation of the republic, it was embedded
in..the constitution of the United States, in a declaration that men
have freedom of worship and of conscience : which the state cannot
abridge nor take away.
. To-day we celebrate again the institution of Thanksgiving. The
circumstances are in great contrast to those that were around the
Pilgrims. We. are surrounded by material comfort, luxuries are
within reach of our many millions of people. Those who have
fallen by the wayside, disinherited of fortune, are the objects of the
care and kindness of their more fortunate brethren. When the
Pilgrims looked out upon the New England shore, they saw a land
that yielded only the wild products of the forest for the support of
wild men. To-day we feast and give thanks, at the end of a season
in which the farms of our country have produced a value of $8,000,
000.000. Our national influence is felt in the remotest capital. Men
who groan in lands that deny to them civil liberty, and those per
secuted for conscience sake, look to us, not in vain, for a helping
hand.
We have been instrumental through the President in making
peace in Asia, so that to-day no nation lifts up the sword against
nation, and in that sense there is peace on earth and good will toward
men. With everything in our international position to heighten Amer
ican^ pride, and with the horn of plenty brimming and spilling upon
us all that makes life comfortable, and with the basket and store of
the poor not forgotten* still we suffer morally from the abundance of
our resources and the energy which has developed them. Men
greedy of unrighteous gain follow where our lamp of Aladdin shines,
to gather to themselves more than their share. They descend to
practices detestable and criminal, greedy and repulsive, to accom
plish their purpose. But the spirit of the Pilgrims is alive and in
revolt against these abhorrent features in our national life, and the
cormorants will be compelled to disgorge and their humiliation will
deter furthertfmitation of their misdeeds.
For this awakening of the public conscience let us be thankful,
as well as for the abundant material blessings that are upon us.
But above all let us not forget the germ of our civil liberty and of
the institutions in which it is enshrined. At times the cry of the re
ligious sectaries has seemed to have in it the intolerance of the
Puritan rather than the 'spirit of the Pilgrims. These sectaries, have
attacked our institutions. They have aimed blows at our public
schools, which are the means of fusing. our. people. into homogeneity
and the cause of that self-centered independence which makes; our
headstrong people ungovernable by any power, but themselves.
When these intolerant' symptoms appear, and the right of the
state to educate the people for the secular purposes of the state is
attacked, lest we forget, let us give thanks that the Pilgrim principle
of freedom of conscience is embedded in the constitution of our
country. Its influence is felt in the current effort to cancel out the
lines of sectarian division, in so far as they fence against Christian
unity for the general moral uplift, which is to be the august move
ment of the immediate future. This movement is destined to en
velop the business and political life of the country, and put, con
science and righteousness into it, to replace the moral barrenness
which has been caused by grasping greed and reckless ambition. The.
time is rapidly passing in which men assumed that morality and
truth, character and life depend upon the garments of creed in which
they are dressed, and it is coming to be known that there is only one
kind of truth, that is the same regardless of the gauds in which men
may dress it. i *
The sober purpose of the day's observance will by no means
banish its social opportunity. Old friendships will be renewed, fam
ilies reunited, cares forgotten, and a cheerful spirit of thanksgiving
will pervade the day through all our wfde borders. ' . 'â¢
THE QUALITY OF LIFE.
PROFESSOR HOWISON has promoted discussion, and, let us
hope, has promoted thought also, upon the common quality of
life in human beings and in animals. He declares that the re
flective faculty implies intelligence and â¢mind, and that where these
impinge upon life, that life is immortal. It is an old question. The
Hindoos held precisely the same doctrine, and ended .where Profes
sor Howison does, with an hypothesis^ for immortality is nothing
more, because it is not demonstrable except by what we call revela
tion. The revelations are i innumerable, but who shall choose be
tween them, for the only qualified witnesses, those who have passed
to an immortal state hoped for, do not return to testify ?.
The Hindoos conformed the hypothesis to their system through
the doctrine of transmigration of the soul. It could be contained* in
the physical form of an insect, or an animal, and by metempsychosis
pass thence to man, to be penalized by. transgression and go back
to a lower form, or to be glorified by obedience,' and continue its
progress upward. Buddhism refined upon this by introducing the
doctrine of reincarnation. The two underwent evolution until we 1
have the dogma of the immaculate conception, held, by a large part
of the body of Christian believers. Itigave the authority of revela
tion to the doctrine of immortality, which was formulated into ritual
by St. Paul. .. \ . v .
We discuss these great issues of philosophy and religion within
the limitation of a belief that life is peculiar to our planet, and that
all creative energy directed to life and its laws has been spent here.
But science, which is marshaled behind an' interrogation point, has
also its revelations. These have made men doubt that we are the
monopolists of life, of reflective mind and intelligence. To those who
have followed the revelations of scienceit is becoming unthinkable
that life is denied to all the rest of the immeasurable. universe.r The
night sky is studded with uncountable suns and systems. That the
elements combine to make worlds other than ours, and -that these die
and disintegrate, is. proved by the flash of meteors ; through our at
mosphere, to be heated by its friction arid, exploding,, send to' us
fragments of the cosmic matter that. once made a world, perhaps
peopled by beings like oarselves.
Immortality is an ennobling hopeta all, and an elevating belief
to those who hold that it is confirmed by revelation. 1 But the;exist
ence of life in other worlds than ours is not confirmed by that' form
of revelation. This causes inquiry. Why was it' hot revealed or
denied ? Why is jt not answered by metempsychosis, by reincarna
tion, by the immaculate conception? Philosophy and science (are
left to struggle with it and get no assistance from metaphysics.

A. J. WATERHOUSE
THE OLD THANKSGIVING DAY. :
HERE'S to the ' old' (Thanksgiving
.day. the. day that we used to
know,
Ere we sDoke our . thanks 'by our tricks
and pranks and the size of the horn
we blow!
Here's to the day that our fathers knew,
the day of Cthelr heartfelt praise, -
When they thanked their God for the
chastening rod, or haply for . pleas-
ant ways! . ' . '-\u0084 ' \u25a0-â¢ . â¢-â¢'.'
Here's to the day when the rounded year
the sum' of Its treasures told! \u0084 \u25a0
For I see c'en now my grandsire bow, as
- he did, in the days of old; /'
Again do I hear the words he spoke, low
words of his thankfulness,
That the One who led was still o'erhead
and was heeding the path we- press.
And my soul is aghast at . the harle
quinade, â¢
The burlesque that seems the thing,:.
The bellowing horns., and the game as
played
By the clowns in pur circus ring;
For, out of the bluster and blare of Ijfe,
one day we might make our own, v
To offer our praise to the God of days
for the good' that the year hath
known.
Here's to the old Thanksgiving day, the
"meeting" we had to attend.
Where the parson droned to his "twelfthv
ly" clause and we children could see
no end'
And here's to the table with bounty
stored! The sermon might "be o'er-
'.-. long, ..'-.
But visible thanks were on the board.
and the turkey was like * a song. â
An edible song that v was flanked by piesâ
the lyrical kind, you knowâ
And, oh, but my sister and I did wis,h
that our stomachs would grow and
grow; - . : \u25a0â¢:
And alter thljturk was a skeleton thing
and gon**was the goodly store, *
We still passed our plates in a longing
way and feebly demanded more.
Ah, still do I see the smile of his cheer
That'ffas on my grandsire's , f ace,
As he thanked the God of the fruitful
year,
- In an ever-lengthening "grace."
We children twisted, as bairns will do,
but, sister of mine, declare
That we drank somewhat from the cup
of praise that bur grandsire prof
fered there..
Here's to the old Thanksgiving day; old
fashioned If so you please,
For the horns that blare do now declare
it was not of such times as these; (
But I know H right well that our God was
near to the men of that former day
Who paused In the strife of this busy life
the words of their praise to say;
And I know right well, for the world I'v*
.. seen, there are troublous times ahead
When we have no praise for the God of
days, but turn to' the clowns instead,
For the God whom our fathers knew and
' loved is our God no less than theirs,
Though we idly 'heed but the buffoon's
deed and list to the horn that blares.
And, oh, for the soulless harlequinade,
The burlesque .that seems the thing,
The bellowing horns, and the game as
played ,
By the clowns in our circus ring!
For the old Thanksgiving day was best,
the dav< of. our fathers' cheer,- :>
When . their . praises' sound an answer
found in the grace for another year.
WHY SHE WOULD MARRY.
"No., mamma, it is in vain to remon
strate. ' >Jl am determjned to, marry." 7
' ! In^thi eyes' of Jtjnejt air *young; creature
; who spoke these fatal words shone the
light of 'fixed determination, and jher, fond
mother recognized' that remonstrance In
deed was in vain.' Nevertheless she felt'
that she had -a duty to perform, and so
she went straight ahead . with'i It -." ,
"But, my daughter," "she said, "you
know' that marriage is a lottery." ..:
"Yes, I know it," was the ready ; re
sponse. . " / ' . â¢ ,
"And many who fancy that they are
securing a prize In the lottery later find
that they have drawn a measly, com
monplace blank which does not permit
them even to "sit on the *fence_ and see
the happy conjugal procession go by." * -
"I know It." - .
"Andâ forgive me. my daughter, if I
speak plainlyâ your father and I are
convinced /that the man whom you ap
pear to be determined to marry is a mere
stick." ; . â¢: ;: ,'
"I know itâ and such a poor specimen
of a stick lhat he would not do for an
ordinary, scrub cane to. lean upon." ; -
"I admit that he is gifted in the matter
of legs, but so is a centipede, and in the
matter, of brains a high-tide clam could
give him several pointers and not notice
that It had missedariy." â¢ : \u25a0 : I
"I know it. . I couldn't be with him. ten
minutes and not, find it out." "
"Well, then, dear daughter, why .da
you insistâ" Â»
"Oh; mamma, mamma, can you not un
derstandâyou t who "are a-woman? I pos
itively will not give the other girls tan
opportunity, to say that I never had a
chance to be married." ; ,
So the wedding took place. ; -.

A LITTLE ADVICE TO WOMEN
THAT FIND IT DIFFICULT TO
RESIST TEMPTATION IN DRESS
ANGELA MORGAN
I WAS talking with a woman friend
recently about "the great temptations
to extravagance in dress that beset
women nowadays. We spoke of the higher
standard set by fashion every, year; the
increasing allurements of the displays and
the growing, tendency of the modern
woman to live beyond her means.
1 As we passed a display window, where
groups of wistful-eyed women stood gaz
ing in transports of delight and longing,
I was moved to remark:
"What strength of will is required for
women to resist such things!"
"Not strength of will so much as en
lightenment," neplied my friend.
' .Every "time I go down town and see
those eager groups . in front of the bril
liant show windows, her words recur to
me.. "Not strength of will so much as
enlightenment" â¢
She is right. Not that the craving. for
beautiful things Is an evidence of limited
understanding. ' Not that the liking for
becoming attire is wrong. That Puritan
ical theory has bÂ«en exploded. We of
to-day look upon beautiful externals as
legitimate aids ' to comfort and pleasure
in living. " >
Yet the woman who is truly enlightened
can be happy,. comfortable, serene, even
if deprived of such aids.
She is able to do this because she is
alive to the fact that beautiful externals
represent only an infinitesimal portion of
all the beauty in the universe.
L She sees that the bewilderingly lovely
I things which* appeal to her so strongly
are all ' merely . perishable symbols of the
beauty that is interior, and that to pos
sess this interior * beauty is to lay hold
of the satisfying and enduring thing.
To gain material beauty at the cost of
Inner beauty is to exchange the real for
the counterfeit; Is to take husks for
nourishment; Is to rob life of its very
; reason . for being.
After all." the, objective side of life, with
its material comforts and delights, repre- r
sents â¢ but a limited part of life. The
physical is only one side of .existence.

;.* This is the tendency of the present ma:
: teriallstic a^e. Too much attention is be
; stowed uiKin the body and lfcÂ» raiment.
The physical side is pampered . and in
dulged, and the spiritual neglected. What
folly, for the sake of the symbol, to let
the reality go! -';'\u25a0\u25a0-,'
It Is necessary that all of us should
realize how substantial are these invisible
realities. Qualities of character are not
vague and intangible, although they may
seem so as compared with what we* call
the real "things of life.". In the realm
of the invisible these qualities are quite
j as tangible to the soul's touch as pearls
; and satins are to the feel of the physical
fingers.
When any woman sacrifices character
qualities to her craving for beautiful ex- â¢
ternals, she exchanges the Imperishable
for the perishable, and she cuts herself
off from the genuine '.realities.' .
j The woman that runs into debt or com- *
pels* some one else to do without in order
that she may gratify her taste* In dress;
; the woman -that gives up honor for fine
i ry's sake, and the woman that permits
: her life jto be miserable because she can,
not possess fine clothes â all of these are
sacrificing the real for the unreal, neg
lecting the roots of existence for thÂ«
leaves and branches.
Â«To the wistful woman who gazes so
longingly upon the material beauties shÂ»
may not possess I must say an urgent
word: ,
Don't overestimate the value of these
symbols. Be beautiful in your eoul, keep
your Ideals high, your conscience- clear,
your life strong and sweet and pure.
Not all the finery In the world could
compensate for the sacrifice of character
qualities. Pernaps you are compelled to
wear garments that are entirely out of
harmony wlth.yoar taste. What If you
must? This Is not a tragedy. The tragedy
lies, in letting go the real for the coun
terfeit. Never do this. If you do not
see it now. some day you will surely know
that character counts more than anything
in the world, and that self -development
is tha greatest of all achievements.

November 20 Is Mark Twain's birthday
âthat date marks the end of his seven
tieth year of genial beneficence. It has
been a long and undisputed reign for the
prince of humorists, and long may It
continue.
Surely no man has reached his seven
tieth birthday with a more perfect title to
winter comfort and summer rest than
Mark Twain. His life has been as full
of wandering and varied adventures as
an egg Is full of meat. In 1533 he was
born In Florida, Missouri, and while he
was a child the home was moved to Han
nibal in the same State. His father, a
local Judge, died when he was twelve
years old, and at thirteen he was at work
In his elder brother's printing office. But
to the care-free boyhood preceding that
date we are indebted for those classic
histories of small-boydom, written very
many years later. "Tom Sawyer" and
"Huckleberry Finn." By 1553 he had be
come a wanderer working in chance print
ing offices in New York, St. Louis, Mus
catine and Keokuk.
In 1557 began the wonderful years of
piloting on the great river described so
fully .in "Life on the Mississippi."
In the meantime his -brother had been
appointed by President Lincoln Secretary
of the ntw Territorial government of Ne
vada, and Mark Twain, becoming "re
constructed," joined him as private sec
retary, "with nothing to do and no sal
ary." His trip across the unsettled West
to this post, and the subsequent year of
mining and prospecting after elusive gold
are described in "Roughing It."
Then came more years of newspaper
work, both in editorial positions and as
correspondent. Including the famous voy
age to Europe described in "Innocents
Abroad." The fame of them put him
on the lecture platform for four years
and his future was assured; and what is
more, the Quaker City voyage led Indi
rectly to his marriage and bis life's hap
piness, la the early nineties came the
failure of his publishing house, the debts
of he assumed, though in no wise
legally bound to do so; and in 1895-6 he
took his wife ar.d daughter on a lecturing
tour around the world, wrote "Following
the Ekjuator," and cleared off the obliga
tions of the house In full.â Harper Bros.

ASKS AID ON BEHALF
OF CITY ? S CHILDEEN
Juvenile Court's Probation
Committee Appeals for
, Funds for Work.
The probation committee of this city
has embodied the following in an appeal:
The Legislature has established juvenile
courts for -the control and care of delinquent
and - dependent children, and' has provided for
probation committees to co-operate with these
courts. The urobatlon committee In this city
has called to its aid an auxiliary committee.
The juvenile court in this city has already
disposed of the cases of over 2000 children.
It treats them not as criminals, 'but as erring
children. It investigates charges as a father
would inquire into a complaint ' against hie
child, and in most cases ' finds . It necessary
only to administer a 'warning. ' It gives the
advice which owlnÂ« to weak, neglectful or
dissolute parentage, or other unfortunate cur
roundinge, the boy or girl does not receive at
home. When home surroundings are such 'that
reform in the home -is impossible, - other carÂ«
is provided for the child. The prison and the
Jail are themselves schools of vice. One night
of detention In a common jail may be suffi
cient to poison a life for all time. The rescue
of hundreds of children has already been ac
complished. . . . . * . \u25a0
The probation committee needs funds to pay
the salaries of those employed to observe chil
dren while under probation and to do the office
work \u25a0 necessary for preserving the recorda of
children who have been before the court. The
committee makes this appeal with confidence
In a generous response, because in a city of
the Â»i:e and Importance of San Francisco the
work to be 'done Involves the performance
of a civic duty.
Already private citizens and business
houses have responded to the appeal cir
culated by the committee and over $2500
has been* subscribed. The salaries of the
probation officers are not provided for by
law, as it Is intended to keep the depart-f
ment out of politics/, therefore the work
of the officers is not rewarded financially. ,

Mlcher Tells Odd Story,
Explaining' Why Painted
Secure Nox Gold Medals
JURORS DO A STUNT
Calif ornja - Brush Wielders
Get Less Honor Than the
Exhibitors of Sardines
The recent . exclusive publication in
this paper of the list of persons |to re
ceive , gold medals for exhibits In coa
nectlon i with I the California display -at
the Portland -exposition ; has furnished
ground for mixed anger and amusement
among the artists who helped to make
up a. fine and ' representative 'showing
for this State, at the biff. fair. :,; :
If was at ! once noticed ,by, the artists
when the list' appeared in The Call that
no painter on canvas" ofi devotee of the
keramic art had a gold" medal' as a
reward. Why this* should be has been
the subject, of lively; inquiry, ever since
at the rooms 'in which? the California
commissioners are winding up affairs.
Not only did individuals fail to get a
gold medal, but the collective exhibi
tion of art was not awarded one golden
token. - AH the;* medals that came Tto
California artists were either of silver
or bronze. To some were given
honorary mention.'
Among the California art exhibitors
were- men and women whose names are
well known- and artistic wonderment is
continually, growing at the I absolute
failure of t any one, or j, all, ' collectively,
to win even a glittering golden bauble
from the Portland \u25a0: Exposition jurors.
During the last week there has been
no lack of artists In the California com
missioners' rooms. The keramic paint
ers have been more numerous than "the
representatives of the canvas, but both
classes have been strongly in evidence
and earnestly inquisitive and persistent
In seeking some reason Cor existing
conditions., - ' v
An amusing explanation Is afforded
by Commissioner Filcher, who said
yesterday that after the artists were
deprived of gold medals by the juries In
their classes aVprotest. was -sent to the
management and that what was known
as the superior jury came to review the
work of their predecessors and to ren
der final judgment. Something like
twenty protests had been filed by -the
California Commissioners. One su
perior Jury of four persons assumed the
task of passing upon the merits of dia
tomaceous earth, â¢ canned fish, aardines,
soused mackerel, jams , and jellies,
wines, oils, pickles and art works. It
performed the stunt of judging all
these and a dozen more sorts of pro
ducts within , two or. three hours. Not
one member of this .superior Jury was
an artist, but the jurors passed," in one
breath, upon the merits of sardines and
in the next upon keramlcs and oil paint
ings. The California commissioner
fumed, but that made no difference. . :-'-
Prior to the Judging of California art
works â¢ Secretary George A. Dennison
informed the commissioners'; that-, the
outlook was not good > for :; fair
play for /California and r ; the; - com-;
missioners thereupon wrote^a' letter" to
the proper 1 party,; but. no visible effect
was wrought as /regards art," although
the superior Jury was persuaded to give
gold medals for wines, soused mackerel,
sardines â¢ arid other ,nori-artlstlc pro-,
ducts to which such medals were orig
inally denied. , ;,*\u25a0;
Artists will long gossip over the re
sults at( Portland. ; Only Latimer,; Niel
sen,' ; Wlthrow, : Sandona, ' Coutta and
Raschen got even silver medals . for
canvases, and the only winners of silver
medals for keramic painting 'were Mrs.
Culp, Mrs. Perley, Mrs. .Haynes, Miss
Kleinschmidt and Miss Colby.'

TO HOLD A CONFERENCE
Representatives of Nine
teen Colleges Invited to
Join in the Discussion
IKEXP YORK, Nov. 28.â ThÂ« council of
JfÂ«w York University at a special meet
ing to-day unanimously committed ' Itself
to the abolition of football. Final action
will not be taken until the next regular
meeting of the council, three weeks from
Monday.
The meeting was called to consider the
following memorials passed by the fac-
u lty, which the committee adopted:
"TbÂ« faculty of the college and the
; faculty of the school of science of Xew
York University respectfully request the
council of the university to call a oonfer
Â«nce of twenty colleges and universities
under the following invitation:
"Upon the unanimous recommendation
of the faculty of the college of arts and
of the faculty of the school of applied
edenc*' Xew -York University Invites each
of the nineteen colleges Â«and universities
whose football team has played with the
team of this university in any year since
its organization in 1595 to a conference to
consider such Questions as follow:
"L Ought the present game of football
be abolished?
"S. If not. what steps should be taken
to secure it* thorough reform?
. WAXT GAaii: ABOLISHED.
"Each .'college or university is invited to
rend a representative of its faculty 'and
c representative of. its athletic organiza
tion, 'making a possible membership of
forty. -'.'â¢..:
"It is deemed proper to add that the
delegatee of Xe^ York University, on the
tinanimoai recommendation of the stu
dent organization,- is Instructed to support
the first- resoiution-^that t.he 'present game
el football uught -to be'ab.ollshed."-
I It I "was aleo voted to hold the confer
â¢ â¢riice on December 8. The Invitations were
eeht out tonight. :
â To dispose of rumors | that the action
of i the Columbia faculty committee on
undergraduate, organizations in abolish
ing football at Columbia was taken mere
ly tp- force the rules committee to reform
'tlie-gAaie and. that the game may be re
vived at Columbia when such a result is
attained. Dean George W. Ketchway ol
She uslrersity. Jaw school made the fol
lowing statement to-day:.. , ;
â¢ : yor opposed to rigdv.
"The action pt the faculty, as I under
stand it. Is not aimed at association foot
ball or the so-called Rugby game, but at.
tfee game ,of football as it now exist)? in
"our - American But this state
\u25a0mcr.t is not to be taken that the action
cf "the committee was taken In order to
fcorce reforms . by the .rules ' committee.
There is ab reason to believe that ftiat
ccminlttee or that the (ootball element in
lour \u25a0 colleges has . any conception of the
discredit Into which this game bas fallen,
'ajid no reason.' therefore, to hope for a
revision of the rules that will have any
material Influence on the game.
. "'But the truth Is that the worst fea
tures of tfces game are such as no jevlsion
rules will touchâ the dishonest and
unsportsmanlike spirit which the game at
present fosters.' A revision of therulete
can at best do no more than relieve the
came of some of the dangers to life and
limb which lt.npw involves. and to render
the playing, of 'dirty* football .a little less
Â«;asy of concealment.* When any game"
reaches, the point "where it needs to be
hedged, about .with stringent rujes to. preÂ»
vent the young, men In our colleges from
resorting 'to trickery and 'dishonesty in
tljetr college sport* It Is vain to look to
any. enfprcement of the rules for relief
"frpn> Its evils. â¢ .
" -'For. these reasons' lÂ£ does not seem to
me .<hat' the; action taken by the faculty
committee .yesterday .is lilceVy to be af
fected by any subsequent -proceedings on
â¢the uirt of WAlt^r Camp and his- commit
tee,; â¢â¢ ; ".'.'.
â¢"While It JÂ« -generally conceded, at Co
lumbia, even . among football men; that
tHe game has been killed, a mass meeting
of students" haVbeen called for Tuesday'
by the student board' to ascertain the real
feentiment of the students on the question
and If it be against the recent action of
the committee t,o submit a petition to
President Butler.-"

together this 1 ' morning ' before their/

football Question and the agitation in

president repeated his strictures upon
the rules committee, which were part
of his remarks on football at the uni

President Eliot on Football.
CAMBRIDGE, Mass-.,"- Nov.. 29. â Presi
dent Eliot of Harvard University ; de
clined to-day to comment updn the
action of the committee of -Columbia
University in -abolishing football.
President Eliot permitted it to be
known that he "had declined the prop
osition of Chancellor; McCracken of
New York University to call a meeting
of college- presidents ,to consider the
question of football 'because he thought
that college presidents were not a com
petent body to deal with reform in the
game. â¢ .
J." D. Grieene, secretary to President
Eliot, said- it was the purpose of the.
head of Harvard to- say .whatever he
ha,d to say on the .subject In his annual
report to the unfversits' trustees, which
will be presented In February, 1906.

Especial blame was.' placed by Presl r
dent Wheeler /upon ' Paul Dashiel, a
member of the committee, who is said
to have blocked ; Camp's proposed re
forms. President' Wheeler said:
As it la now played, ; football . has lost its
usefulness as. a sport.:. -.We want a simpler,
more open {tme. â¢ Football hae become j too

Quotation.
FRED E. MULHOLLAND.
The "evil eye" /apparently ; still', exer
cises its fatal influence over the favor
ites at Oakland track, as five more sun
burnt and overdone choices caused sor
row yesterday at many a fireside. .The
track of course was juicy as a Rocky
Ford melon, and dope and figures In this
sort of going are worth about- seventeen
cents on the dollar. Climatlo Influences
worked no change in the , '.-' attendanoe;
the regulars being out in full force.
It is customary to. trim a newcomer,
no matter what his reputation is, and
Grazlallo, the clever Eastern performer,
waa presented with his in the last, a
six and a half furlong purse run. The
stranger closed at. 9 -to 6 favorite with
Knapp up, and in a hard drive lost Ito
Judge by a head. Truebel piloted the
winner, and he can thank his lucky star
that the judges did not disqualify "hiÂ»
mount.' Herding tactics may have been
in vogue in Latonia, but they will - not
carry far here.
IRON WATSOX A WnffJTER.
Jillette. favorite for. "the two-year
old sprint, which opened the raolnpr.
anchored somewhere ouside of the
heads and had not been reported as the
paper went to press. The winner turned
up in Jron Watson, a 12 to 1 outsider.
He was ridden by Herbert and beat
Merry-Go-Round out a length at the
stand. Hoffman landed the show with
Abe Meyer. \u25a0*
As if Iron Watson were not surprise
enough, Holly Berry, a 25 to 1 shot, came
along and snatched the second race from
Yellowstone", , the 13 .to 10 favorite. Lloyd
Fountain piloted the latter horse, and a
sixteenth from* home looked a winner.
There he appeared -to have an attack of
.6tage fright and T. Sullivan, on the out
eider, grabbed him. Prestano taok the
show from Wistaria by a neck.
Mafalda, the Keene entry for the seven
furlong selling affair, was -'installed a 2&
to 1 favorite, receded to 4\b and couldn't
raise a gallop. Dura I, with Fountain in
the saddle,â had her odds forced down
from S to 6 and, leading- throughout, won
hard ridden from the. tardy. .Warte \u25a0

post favorite,- Bountiful. â¢
KEEXE'S COLORS ' IX FRONT.
There . were only half a dozen starters
for the mile and twenty yards selling run,
and' Jack Keene's San Primo made. a run
away race of it. The Bassetlaw gelding
went to the post equal favorite with Ban
nock Belie, and he downed the mare with
ridiculous ease. Dixie Lad, which might
have been a good thing, ran a moderate
third. . . ' ' ; .-, .
McÃrlde assuredly does ;..\u25a0 have a â¢ diffi
cult time endeavoring to put a favorite
over the plate first." ! ; He had the leg up
on Plckaway, an 8 to' s chance, for the
Futurity course sprint and after playing
a one-night stand out in -front .ot the
bunch finished third. When It looked aa
if Procrastination, a' 25 to 1 shot, wpuld
mop up, : Emmet Loague came with a
well-timed rush on old Matt Hogan,.win

poor race. ' \u25a0â¢ " â¢ \u25a0 . .'- \u25a0

launch Earl X, waterlogged and badiy
damaged, is tied up at the Vallejo-streat
boat landing/whither she was towed
after having been pulled off the beach
at Malate Point. .-.. '
The scow schooner Emma was dis
masted " yesterday* morning in Mission
Bay. The- scow' schooner Georgie
Woods fouled the Postal Telegraph
Company's transbay cable. The schooner
Alpine* collided with a State dredger
and the schooner Nimrod drifted into
the breakers off Fort Point and was so
badly damaged , that ; she ; now lies
waterlogged on the mud of Mission
Bay.; The ferry steamer James F. Dona
hue, on the 8 o'clock : trip from Sausa
lito, picked up a pile, which toro great
holes in her paddle-box and: gave her
passengers a few minutes' unpleasant
excitement. It was a small blow as
far as . the bay ' was ; concerned and of
brief duration, but it , was very bu3y
while it stayed in the harbor limits
and its victims, although small, were
many. â¢
ALL 'HANDS SAVED.
The Ida A went ashore at 2 o'clock
Tuesday afternoon on the Lamanor Bar,
near Point Reyes. She was bound from
here for Point Reyes with a hold filled
with grain and 5000 feet of lumber on
deck. She Js owned byKlitgard, Nel
son & Co. and plies between here and
Point, Reyes, '.'.taking, supplies, for the
ranchers and bringing back butter,
eggs and other produce for this mar
ket. She is a vessel of about thirty
six tons and is valued at $6000.
Captain Martin Beck, his engineer
and deckhand were taken oft by the
life-saving ' crew from Point Reyes.
Captain Kiel yon, in charge of the Point
Reyes station/yesterday telephoned
word of the wreck to the 1 Lighthouse
Board and said that he j was* return
ing to the scene of the trouble, having
landed the Ida A's people at Point
Reyes._ , .
Klitgard,^ Nelson ;&â¢ .\u25a0 Co.-^last' night
:dispatch'ed"their gasoline boat Mary , C.
Captain Campbell; to, the scene of the
wreck . and f an -effort will be made to
save as much as possible of the Ida A
and her cargo. '" ;\u25a0- " '; "..'..
The gasoline launch Speedy, with the
morning, newspapers for, subscribers in
Sausalito . and San - Rafael . and two
passengers onboard, went ashore early
yesterday morning on Angel ; Island.
The tooting of the Speedy*s whistle
brought. a number of soldiers to the
scene and with their aid everybody was
safely landed. The newspapers stayed
with the wreck. \u25a0 The ' passengers were"
a man and woman who had strolled
down to : McNelll's ClboatJbouse :in ' the
small, hours of the morning' and ' ex
pressed a desire to take a trip on the
bay. The Speedy is in a bad place and
probably will ''â¢\u25a0 prove a total loss. Her,
engine maybe recovered. '\u25a0 ;.
SIIBIMP LAUNCH STRANDED.
The gasoline launch Earl X, belong
ing to the Union Shrimp Company, left
the camp at Point San Pablo on Tues
day, night with a load of shrimps for
this V market. In the storm which
caught her -soon after she started her
engine broke* down and she was driven
ashore at > Malate v^Polnt. "When ; she
failed to reach; this "city two of Crow

.The- glorious scheme:by. wh eh George

Of confiding investors, has, finally \u25a0 crum

Smith,; representing the defrauded stocK
holders.
Smith Vsued , Rumble for.; an accounting
of Â£411 moneys Uhat, had come Into his
possession through, the sale of stock.
Rumble testified that all of U. with the

properties," and .was lost to him and to
everybody. He told of a mining dredger,
aground on seme, bar in- one of the
northern .rivers, where, -he could . not or
would not ' tell, that represented ; he said,
an expenditure of "$llO ,OOO, and. told of
other Investments that had : depleted the
treasury of the Sunset Company.
In addition ; to the $3000 on deposit with
the "Guaranty Company, however, the
stockholders found some $340 ; on deposit in
the name of Mrs. Rumble. These two
sums of money Judge Graham . ordered
turned over to Smith. on~account . of the
Judgment, and it is quite - probable that
this is all the â¢ deluded stockholders will
ever : recover.^ElHBflBHHHBHRMj
It \u25a0 was asserted by . the plaintiff In the
action that in order to consummate his
fraud Rumble permitted M. /A. Fritz and
H. A. Hardinge to. secure possession,
through suits, of the Old Glory
mine in Butte County, the most' valuable
asset of the Sunset Mining Company,
and that Ira A. Pease, president of the
company, was also active 'in carrying; out
the. conspiracy that ha 3 resulted in such
woe to; Rumble.
Litigation over the Old Glory mine has
not yet been concluded, . however, so the
ultimate fortune . of the stockholders is
still a matter for. speculation. .

Current Stock Speculation.
Henry Clew* of New York says:
Sirck speculation is becoming very ac
tire. trading frequently running over the rate
cf 1.000.00U share* per day. The firmnese
Â» r.h which all eecurittes are held Is remark
abie. Seller* ere few and trading 1* seem
ingly ccna&ed almost entirely to purchases
tor the rise, A great deal of manipulation
it observable In certain stocks, giving the
xcarket a ilecidecly spotty and feverish ap
jtirance. Some of these securities have been
c-utfhed up to what ectms a top-heavy level;
but conditions continue satisfactory and con
tM strocg, so that In spite of the com
belief that price* are too high, the opjn
!* ireely expressed that they may go
titter. Beyond a doubt the specula
tive spirit 1* rising and cannot be Indefinitely
â¢uppressed If the situation remains as favor
able as now. Besides, very powerful Inside
support I* observable in some quarters, which
is no doubt a basis of much of the manipula
tion by the big traders. As . yet the outside
jrub'lc, though Increasing the'.r purchases, have
not beccrr.e free operators, transactions brtng
largely confined to the professional element.
!T;e future of the market, however, is hopeful,
â¢ ii.cc bade conditions are almost universally
lavcrtile. and nothing but the possibility of
& fcJTch in the money market or reckless
xnaa'iinjlatiijr; prevents Increased actli .iy. '
Tbe Outlook for **loi-.<--rÂ«
A f.r.ancia.l report from New VcrK sa;.ii:
"Lt-sk uneasiness has been exa^^ienceil in
the local moÂ»;y :i.arkt:. Attracted by high in
ternet rates tunds have been returning from the
Interior, white additional relief has been Ee
cjred by a temporary shifting of leans to Eu
rope. Cotddenor was als^ strengthened by
the knowledge that Secretary Shaw would
come to the relief of the money market in
case of necessity; and the lact that he has
&.neenttd to prolong his stay in the Treasury
tH?partirient until ihe spring his given., added
â¢iiliffaction In this refpect. During the past
two years there has b*en a great increase In
llie supply cf money, amounting to about
FMUOOtf.OTfti so that it ie somewhat surprising
that scarcity should be bo pronounced and uni
versal. Of course, the demand for money has
\<v*n greatly iiiCÂ«-.&sed t>y the activity of busi
ness and the high price of commodities. In
t.-. probability, . however, the chief increase In
<lemend has l?een from speculative Bources, not
only in New York, but espacially in the inte
rior, where exijensicn has been going on at a
rapid rate. Since the first of September there
hÂ£.s been a contraction of nearly 9100.000.000
In loans et the New York bank* ; but this item
still stands at very high figures and further
contraction would have been beneficial, even
had it caused wholesome liquidation. The out
look is "against any Immediate improvement in
the raonrtary situation, especially as tome tem
lorary Inconvenience may be experienced
*â¢. r.t the &m cf December and the first of
J.yjary to meet the disbursements usual at
"""If -c periods. Extreme rates, however, are
iS : probable, for the reason that the situation
rJ' b^en pertlally relieved by liquidation, and
if necessary assistance can be obtained either
"Â»>â¢ extending our borronings abroad or through
*<s>njderr* upon Secretary Â£haw. After the
middle of January we may look for Improved
conditions in the local money market, but until
then there will be no important Increase in the
f>upr!y of funds available for stock market pur
pose*."

Xevr York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Nov. 29.â The pace of the
â¢peculation was halted in to-day's stock mar
ket, partly as a general revulsion from the
vo:atilÂ« rise of the last few days In special
stocks and partly from a narrowing of the
resources in the money market, which exercised
sotne constraint upon speculative activity. . The
effect of tbe excessive buoyancy was most pro
tsrÂ»uncÂ«d in the aouthern Iron group and some
ether metal Industrials. The raUromt litt
moved but narrowly and was slightly aCected
comparatively with the violent reactions in the
industrials as It had been for eeveral day* past
*/\u25a0- their advances. It might almost be sold
-45 '-i: holders of standard securities showed a
TV-isc of reiiet at the check to tbe extravagant
ruthlng up of prices .among the industrials.
Tbe general list was not free from- evidence
cf <Jt;ro;Â£!on. however, and violent fluctua
tions continued to characterize the industrial
department. Lead, especially, made a further
advance cf *>"\u25a0Â» during tbe da> in repetition
of its course for several days past, and while
It wa* not free from the reactionary effect of
the . general movement It persisted In its up
Â»-crd course. Tennessee Coal and Sloes-Shef
field Fteel. on the other hand, elurnix-d in a
way to caufe apprehension of dlsfcfctrons con
â¢equences to the speculative holder* in the
stock. TbÂ«re waa a fear that tbe con: c? t la
the open market, if there was one. had been
completed by the acquisition of a majority of
boiClr.j-s of Tennessee Coal and that the mar
ket for the minority of the stock would be al
lowed to take care of itself. The persistent
heaviness of the United Etates Steel stocks
In face of the njovÂ«n*ct In other Iron and rteel
ir.duuu-lals i* In eplte of tee rumor indus
trio-ueiy. circulated that the control of these
l.'KJVpendent companies it nought la behalf cf
that corporation. The rumom regarding the
group continued, and the chares showed coa
s'fierab'e strcnsrtli. ThÂ«Â« assertions of passing
o' control of National J>ad also persisted and
the movement* cf Cotton Oil and Virginia*
Carol'.na Chemical were coupled with talk of
an Intended merger. St. Paul derived no bene
fit from the announced plan - for \u25a0 the Â«xten
tloiJ to the Pacific Coaet. The lack of sub
e-riptlon privileges to the company** treasury
stock was a disappointment to some , of tho
recent speculative buyer*, and the general
orllcy of the extension did not Â«eem suffldent
*r a-traci'.ve to offset this dlBappoÂ»=traent,
R.W we*kne*Â« In Northern Pacific aad Great
Northern preferred, attributed to the effect^ of
this threatened rir.'ry. !?ut Union , Pacific, the
rjoet active market stock. Â»trcnÂ«c amonz the
trar:*syatlnc,ntal lines, showed some re*lBtance
V the heary undertone of the market. With the
f-tiaxksgiviÃj- Holiday comlnc oa- the last day
rY ihe month preparations for the December
1 tettlfmect tnaCe thescifelves felt *n the money
ranrket to-day. Tbe shifting of accounts In
s<i-T.t to tbese pr^sftratlons â¢ resulted In rnn
i**t call money up : to 9 p*r ce nt. The move- ;
â¢raw* â¢.!â¢ . Amalramated Copper was In response
to the continued Tin In the price of Its product,
tf^e declaration of another 10 per cent extra
Â«lvio'end on Lackawacta was regarded as ex
planatory to the extraordinary; price . level -at
Â»hkh that Ftock'has been beld. but Its general
yffi^t "B"fcÂ« not f'nwu'Hf ' Tbe sentiment was
accentuated In the later dealing* by the flurry

United States bonds were all unchanged on

An extra dividend of 10 per cent on the
stock of the Delaware, Lackawanna and West

GAS CALLS TWO
MORE VICTIMS
Frederick Dasmann, a Boy of
Seventeen, Is Supposed to
Have Committed Suicide
FOUND DEAD IN BED
James Early, a Painter. Be
lieved to Have Accidental
ly Turned on the Fluid
Freflerick Dasraann. 17 years of age, a
clerk In the grocery of his father. Wil
liam Dasmann, ISB Thirteenth 'street,
committed suicide early yesterday morn
ing by turning on the gas. He usually
eiept In a room in the rear of the gro
cery, where there iÂ» no gas, but his dead
body wa* found in a partly furnished
bedroom on the aecond floor above the
grocery. ,
Adolpn. Kowalsky, a roomer in the
house, detected the odor of gas on the
second floor early yesterday morning and
notified William Dwmaim and John ,
Lux. Dasmaun'a father-in-law. They \
traced Uie odor to the partly furnished ;
befiroom. and on opening the door found j
the bey lying on the bed. fully dressed, j
vhlle gas was escaping from a wide
open Jet. A physician was summoned, j
end he said the boy had been dead for
about two hours.
What led to the theory of suicide was
the fact that the keyhole was stuffed
with cotton, and there was no gas in the j
oem in the rear of the ctore where the
boy usually elept. The boy's father told.
l>puty ' Coroner Fennell that he could
not account for his son committing- sui
cide, but Fennell was Informed that the
boy's mother became insane prior to his
lurth, and that might have accounted for
the rach act. The boy had been attend
ing a night school ana returned home
shortly after 10 o'clock. The body was
taiien to the Morgue.
James Early is another victim of car
bon monoxide. He lived at a lodging
house at 122 Sixth street, and yesterday
his landlady detected the odor of gas
coming from his room. She opened the
door with a pass key and found the room
full of gas. which was escaping from an
open Jet. Early was lying on top of his j
bed, partly undressed, and she disco v- j
cred that he was dead. She told Deputy
Coroner Fennell that Early had been
drinking heavily and had probably turned j
o;i the gas accidentally. He was 50 years .
of age and had lived in her house for the j
last fourteen years. He was a member
of the Painters' and Decorators' Union, j

On behalf of John Gibbons, accused of

Police Judge Mogan, eying an antique

"Internally," replied the attorney, "it Is
deranged. Will the officer please wind it
up and start it going?". i
The officer obeyed the acquiescent nod
from the bench; and no , sooner was the
winding-up completed than a small door
in the upper facade of the clock suddenly
opened, an ornithological- effigy abruptly
shot out of the hole - thus made and
quickly and ' loudly croaxed "Cuckoo"

by Clerk "Pat" Gray. Then It . backed
into the hole and the little door closed
witb Â» sharp I snap, whjle the clock con
tinued to tick Epasmoctlcally.
"The court has seen and heard," began
the attorney/for, the defense, "the bird
call twenty-three times," which is almost
double the number -of- hours indicated on j
the dial. Now if 'the court will listen
the irregular ticking I think the court
will be satisfied thatâ "
Open flew the little door, out shot the
little wooden bird, again the court re
sounded with twenty-three rapid-fire
"Cuckoos" and the vanishing act was re

withY forgery. The complaint was
sworn to . before Police - Judge. Conlan
yesterday morning by M. Scbymeinsky,
a" shoemaker at 3506 Sixteenth street.
Back ;of the charge r of forgery is an
alleged : attempt ' to , swindle -. Schymein

and ; Sanchez streets,' which is .valued at
522,600.. \u25a0 "\u25a0â¢\u25a0â¢-.- . :!â
.â¢A few days ago Schymelnsky had a
probable [ purchaser; for the property,
andiwhen an examination of the title
was : made:at the City Hair it, was dis
covered - that on" November, 11 a con
tract purporting to have been signed by
Schymeinsky.% dated May 11 and au
thorising ;Mark Lane, 'a real ' estate
agent at 634 Market street, to sell the
property/arid agreeing to give Lane 22
per; cent â¢ on the sale, -had
been recorded. On ' November 17 ' an
other contract signed by. Lane. 'as agent
for Schymeinsky^to sell the - property
to Alexander' ilond, a printer, whose
placed of, business 'is above Lane's of
fice,! for $22,500, was recorded.,
Schyrrieinsky was - of. these
contracts, and he went. to. the ' City
Hall, and declared that his signature
to the contract authorizing^ Lane to sell
his ! property ;was a. forgery.: :The';c6n
tract was ; signed by .Tremayne as wit
ness, and there was a notarial certifl
cate attached J that Tremayne had ap
peared before the, notary and made the
affidavit that he had seen Schymeinsky
sign the paper. :
The police 'were notified ".and Detec
tive . Whitaker was detailed on the case.
He }oaw â¢ Lane, .who* explained -that I the
contract came into his hands from .Tre
mayne, who had 'worked ; for him as a
solicitor in the, ordinary course ". of
business.? Indorsed on the back of the
contract was an assignment by Lane to
George<S.' Evans, his brother-in-law, to
all of the benefits accruing under the
contract, and; when asked why he . had
made the assignment "he replied that it
,\vas a- purely a financial transaction.
\u25a0 Tremayne was arrested "on Tuesday,
night, ; and r : whear questioned by - Detec
tive ' Whitaker, admitted that he . had
written, the whole ; of ; the. contract, in
cluding the notarial certificate himself,
and had signed Schymeinsky's name to
it, because he ; said, Schymeinsky had.
told , him to do so. . Sohymeinsky saw
Tremayne in prison yesterday and said
he ' had ; never; seen him in . his . life be
fore, j Tremayne repl ied that Schymein
sky had seen him a long time ago and
-had told him at that time. â¢
Attorney \Vest, ; who represents Schy

CASH ACCOUNTS
ARE MISSING
John Henry Dockweiler. civil engi
neer, employed by the city and county
of. San -V x rancisco as an â¢ expert in the
suit of the Spring Valley Water. Com
pany against the City to enjoin the en
forcement of the water rate schedule
of 1903-04. was placed on the witness
stand yesterday by John S. Partridge.
Mr. ~, Dockweiler testified that he ; had
personally inspected the Spring Valley
properties and ' that he had had the
books and accounts of that corpora
tion examined by an accountant, from
tne beginning of the company's life up
to January; I,', 1904,- but.' that the ac
countant; had been, hampered because
several cash books were missing, which
prevented an analysis of the items, and
allowed only "of journalized entries
covering such' prriods of omission. - Mr.
Dockweiler continued:
The accountant's' report to me shows thÂ»t
the; Serins Valley Water Works at one tlmÂ«
was operating by means of an auxiliary com
pany known as the Suburban Water Company.
I Jiite sums of money for land and for struc
tures were paid to this company by' the Sprint
Valley Water Works, but . the sums " charged
were not available, as the officers of the com
pany did not deem It expedient to permit Â«m
examination of those books by the representa
tives of the city. I have asked for details
from the office of the company's engineer rela
tive to the cost and was always Informed that
It was Impossible to determine the cost. I
know that the company has data sufficient. to
enable It to supply the exact cost ' of each and
every ' structure that now comprise Its works.
From my status â¢ I coincide with the views
expressed by Professor Frank Parsons, presi
dent of the National Public Ownership League
tn the report of the Industrial Commission of
1801. .
Engineer Dockweiler then said that
it would-be unfair to judge a water rate
on a bare statement of per capita where
only a' certain proportion of the popu
lation is supplied. In an extreme case,
where only one-half the population is
supplied, the conÃumers" rate would be
double the per. capita. ; â¢â¢.- -i
In reply to a question by Mr. Part
ridge .the witness said that the present
capacity of the" Spring Valley -Water
Works was 35,000,000 gallons per diem
and .the consumption very nearly the
same. In making a comparison '.-; of
rates.ladded the witness,- the number of
persons I served per mile .-of t main pipe
must be taken into consideration. , .:
The examination of Mr. "Dockweiler
will be: resumed on Friday morning at
10 o'clock. "
