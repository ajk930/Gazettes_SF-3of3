If President Roosevelt follows cer

there will be no reciprocity treaty
with . Germany. . The German; Govern
menti which has given notice that it
will next spring terminate its "most
favored nation" treatment of all coun
tries which do not make commercial
concessions 'for. German products, is
anxious for a reciprocity^treaty". There
are grave doubts that the United States
Congress will ratify any new trade
treaty with Germany. .
The conference purports to be non
political. The prime mover in it is
former Senator Harris of Kansas, a
Populist.. It has been, announced that
the keynote of the session would be
President '.MeKinley's last 'speech at
Buffalo, in which r he declared I "the
period of excluslveness-is pust.'Jjl . \u25a0,* \u0084'â¢

Roosevelt was" adverse/to* receiving, a

of the Department of Agriculture and

Should a foreign Government like
Germany enter upon a tariff war with
the United States, because of the con
tinued maintenance of a high tariff, the
meat, export trade and _ the commerce
abroad in American agricultural ma
chinery would be the first interests
hard hit. , This Is said to explain their
interest in the reciprocity conference. .

In discussing the competitive life for
leadership in society, the speaker said:
"Society Is dying out at the top: It
is a crystal maze of glass houses, where
no occupant dares throw the first stone;
the dangerous example â the academy
of divorce. Society has mothers who
are slaves to the siren calls of fashion
and frivolity, who look more often into
their mirrors than into the faces of
their children. With a fashionable
mother gadding about at social func
tions and a fashionable father at his
club, the jesult will be that within a
decade the question of the neglected
children of the rich will become as
great a social problem as that of the
neglected children of the poor."
DETROIT, Aug. 15. â The annual con

Is superintendent of compulsory educa
tion in Chicago, was the feature of the
day aad created a mild sensation among
the delegates. The speaker produced
Federal statistics, covering the past
twenty years, showing thAt the indus
trial competition of women, children
and machine labor was driving the
men out of the large cities to fields
of heavy munual labor in mining and
agriculture. He declared that women
were destined to be the ruling sex in
industrialism, and continued:
"Man, like the Indian, is dying out
and being driven out. In 1890 there
were 3,&14,i<71 women who were em
ployed in g-ainful occupations in Amer
ica. In 1900 the number had increased
to 5,229,807. The britii rate of_Xemales.
is increasing and the death rote deÂ«
creasing. It is just the reverse among
the males. We are rapidly drifting to
the age of "eternal feminine,' when
man will be a back number and forced
to return to the soil and to those fields
of labor w-here only his physical endur
ance will save him in the struggle for
eurvival."

Twenty-Five Years Ago
WASHINGTON. Aug. 15. â In response
to published charges that officials of
the United States Geological Survey
have used information belonging to the
Government for the benefit of the Min
ing World, a magazine in which certain
members were said to hold stock. Di
rector Charles D. Walcott to-day tele
graphed to Acting Director H. C Rlzer
an' explanation from Drummond, Mont.,
where he is In Vamp. The explanation
follows:
Mail and newspaper clippings were received
by me In camp August 11. The Geological
Survey or Its members has not and does not
own or control the Mining World. No Informa
tion has been sold or given in advance of gen
eral publication to any Journal or individual, to
mv knowledge. The request to nominate com
petent writers for the Mining World, made to
Dr. Day for the purpose of making It a first
class mining journal, was approved by the
director, subject to- the regulation that the
Mining World was to be treated exactly as all
other Journals in all matters pertaining to the
survey. A fraction of the stock of the Mining
World was subscribed for as a purely private
matter by some members of the survey. Pop
ular â¢ articles based on technical papers first
published by the survey have the approval of
the director, whether written by members of
the surrey or others.
All information and Illustrations arÂ« as free
to the outsider as to the survey, members. The
director baÂ« the most cordial relations with
the editor of the Mining: Engineering Journal
and Invites criticism from '\u25a0 this and other
sources, as constructive criticism Improves the
service. If any one has evidence of wrong
doing or Injudicious action on the part of any
members' of the survey, the director aska that
It be sent to the President, the Secretary of
the Interior, the chairman of the committee
appointed by the President to Investigate thÂ«
business methods of the uovernment. or to the
director. CHARLES D. WALCOTT.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 15.â Although the

PRINTED CHARGES
Hearings have been held in various
sections of " the country and not infre
quently have changes in the schedules
been made for the announced purpose
of remedying alleged abuses. Combi
nations of railroads and private car
lines have prevented any wholesale
regulation of : these rates. Charges of
discrimination against small shippers
have poured in on the commission for
a number of years.
The commission "alleges further that
the charges published jointly by the
refrigerator lines and the railroads for
the refrigeration of fruits in certain
specified territories are unreasonable
and unjust and in violation of section 1.
The territories described include Indian
Territory, Texas, ; California ' and
Kansas. \u25a0 â¢
. The railroads and, refrigerator lines
are made respondents in. the proceed
ings, which require that specinc an
swers to the allegations. be made to the
Interstate Commerce,' Commissi6n by
September i.E. Mt; is.charged, that by
way of rebates or other devises the re
frigerator lines are acting for the rail
roads as authorized agents, and the
railroads, "acting through the refrig
erator lines, are collecting and receiv
ing for* the refrigeration of fruit and
vegetables lower rates for some ship
pers than they are contemporaneously
receiving for, similar service rendered
to other, shippers. This is held to be
in violation of sections 2 and 3 of the
act to regulate interstate commerce.
Another charge is that failure and
neglect to publish at shipping stations

Commission the rates and charges im
posed for the refrigeration of fruits

of section 6 of the. interstate commerce

WASHINGTON. Aug. 15.âThe,Inter
state Commerce Commission, on. its own
Initiative and as a result of complaints
against private car lines, to-day'unex
pectedly began an' investigation of. the
relations 'of railroad and refrigerator
lines, both of which, it is charged, are
violating the act regulating; interstate
commerce In several specified particu
lars. , The: complaint is directed against
the Armour Car.'Line; the American Re

The acting Secretary decided- that the res
ervation was authorized only If "necessary to
conserve and protect the water supply. ami
requested the President to release them from
reservation, which was done to-day by supplÂ«
mental proclamation.
WASHINGTON. Aug. 15.â The Presi
dent has modified his proclamation, of
the -3d instant, withdrawing from en
try certain lands in the Uintah Indian
Reservation, and has restored about
85,000 acres. Following Is the Interior
Department's statement of the action:
' The act of March 3. 19C5, provides "that, be
fore the opening of the Uintah Indian Reserva
tion, the Bresident may eet apart and reeerve
any reservoir site or other lands necessary to
conserve and protect the water supply for the
Indian* or for general agricultural develop
ment." Accodingly, the United States Geolog
ical Survey, after due investigation, made a
report to the Secretary of the Interior, recom
mending that certain described lands, covering
over 200,000 acres, Including a large quantity
of \u25a0 agricultural lands, be reserved under ' saiu
provisions of law. Upon this recommendation
the acting Secretary of the Interior requested
the President to issue his proclamation mak
ing such reservation, and accordingly the Pres
ident issued his- proclamation of August 3, lOCS.
Subsequently complaints have reached tne
department that the said agricultural lands
properly should not be included in said reser
vation. Mr. Ryan, the acting Secretary, too*
the- .- subject up for further consideration ana
directed the United States : Geological Survey
to n:ake a' supplemental report, stating spe
cifically whether the reservation of these ag
ricultural lands was necessary for the con
servation and protection vt a water supply.
This supplemental report has been made and
shows that the reservation of these lands la
not necessary for that purpose, but that they
were lpcluded in the surveys original report
en the assumption that the act authorized their
reservation for "agricultural development,
which was specifically stated in it.

Sir Patrick Manson gave the second
and third cf his series of lectures before
the students of Cooper Medical College
jesterday. The subject for the morning
was "The Guinea Worm," and for the
evening "Parasitic Blood . Spitting."
Many members of the medical fraternity
of, San Francisco were present to listen
to the remarks of the famous pathologist.
The morning lecture was a further il
lustration of the distribution and effects
of. tropical , djseases,. this. being, the title
under which all of the lectures are to
come. Sir Patrick said in part:
The diesemlnatlon of diseases depends, not on
the condition of the human b'Xly, but on the
physical circumstance the paras. te encounters
In passing trcm one' human body to another.
The distribution of the parasite depends upon
the egg after entering ihe human body, the
conditions of the propagation being high tem
perature and moU tare.
Another condition lhat certain tropical dis
eases demand tor culture Is the presence of
sine animal to enable them to paÂ«s from thÂ«
embryotlc cute to a more fertile field. These
germs must of necessity be fostered In tropical
climates. The guinea worm is used to Illus
trate this because the process by which this
worm gets rid of its young applies in this in
stance. The young cf the guinea worm, after
escaping from a body into water, enters a
crustaceous form ana unccrgoea a decided
change in order. to re-enter another body to
start on another rampage against health.
Parasitic blood spitting was taken up
in the address given in the auditorium in
the evening, and was dealt with in the
same style characteristic of- the previous
lectures by the noted man of research.
He profusely illustrated his address on
the disease, that resembles consumption,
yet is distinct in be.'ng of different origin.
Sir Patrick told of the small parasite
that enters the system of some animals,
but never of the animals of America, be
ing confined to those of tropical regions,
and starts a cough and spitting. Later
the patient's condition may resemble a
consumptive's and cause death as the lat
ter disease does.
Sir Patrick was alarmed, he said, by
the spread of this germ among the ani
mals with which it comes in contact. He
said it may enter the body of a man as
Well and cause the patient to die from
its effects in a much shorter time than
animals.
Lantern slides of the many germs and
processes of development of these germs
from their embryonic state to full growth
â¢were given. The students and hearers
were in this way enabled to get a clearer
conception of their character.

Two theories' are advanced: that

claret, to cover up his theft of Powell's
property, or that Powell, brooding
over the disappearanpe. of "his, alleged
brother and his money, sought relief
from his troubles In death.. The lat-,
ter theory Is weakened by the fact that
Powell was always jolly and could al
ways obtain funds from his home .In
Philadelphia. He seemed to think a
great deal of -s his roommate, however,
and often 'spoke affectionately of : him.
The two had been 'at house

unable to make a diagnosis,", .'While
unwilling to say that Powell died of
poison. Dr. Clayes intimated that some
drug, probably opium , or one of its
alkaloids, might have ' caused death.
"Knockout drops", might have been
employed.
MURDER ORt SUICIDE.
Landlord Smith saw no more of Powell
until yesterday afternoon, /when he
passed his. door and noticed a lamp
burning. On Investigation he found
Powell unconscious on the bed. Putting
together the story of the alleged broth
er's absence and the missing jewelry, and
money and the wine story Powell had
told him, Smith feared there had been
foul play/ Dr. W. I. Clayes of 754 A
Howard street was summoned. Despite
his efforts Powell died within a few min
utes without- having regained conscious
ness. \u25a0
"My roommate bought the wine to
day, but would not drink of It himself. I
drank 1 several times. The wine had a-pe
culiar, bitter taste, but as I am not a
judge of wine I guess it was all right."
Arthur Powell, a young man who
passed under the name of J. C. Regal,
was found dying In his room at 329 Ste
venson street yesterday afternoon. A doc
tor was hurriedly summoned, -but Powell
expired a half-hour later. Murder is sus
pected. Powell's roommate, who was
passing as the dead man's brother, dis
appeared Monday afternoon, taking with
him two gold watches, a diamond ring
and $40 in cash, belonging to the de
ceased. In the room were found a demi
john of bitter tasting wine and a large
bottle of carbolic acid." Detectives are
endeavoring to locate the missing room
mate, whose name is unknown.
Powell told his landlord," George " S.
Smith, Monday night ' after [ his alleged
brother had disappeared that the wine
had been purchased by the latter. He
said:
Mrs. Robb last saw Powell In April,
when he came to her house to, bid her
good-by, saying that he was going on
the road through Nevada with a the
atrical company.. Although she lived two
doors from I Powell [ she says she did not
know he was in town until ( she was given
his description by Smith. â¢ Mrs. Robb
says. that the man stopping with Poweft
was not his brother, he having but one,
a middle-aged man In the East. She could
not account for Powell traveling under
an assumed name. She declares that the
dead man was extremely effeminate and
had few bad habits. Only recently, she
says, had he learned 'to drink wine. He
was in receipt of a regular remittance
from his folks in Philadelphia,
3 Detective Reagan of the Southern sta
tion worked on the. case, but failed to
come 1 to ,any conclusion .regarding the
method of death. The body was removed
to the Morgue. An analysis of the wine
and the stomach's contents will be made
by the city chemist. :

A merchant would not expect to lease or build a big store-
building as cheaply as a small one: but it sometimes hap-
pens that he imagines he can keep the- big store full of
buyers with the same expenditure for publicity as he
would make for the smaller store. No one knows just
why the merchant is ever seized with this aberrationâ
but unless he quickly throws it off he finds himsel I "tak-

To fill a big store, every business day, with buyers is the same
problem as that of filling the little store, or the any-
size store; the solution, in any case, being ''adequate

ever had thisâ and charm of store-keeping is partly in
the fact that no one has yet sounded its possibilities â as
no store has been advertised as fully and persistently and
aggressively and enthusiastically as it might have been.

WOOSTERI Ohio, Aug. 15.â After hav
ing been on the witness stand ever since
last Thursday, and having seen subjected
to a rigid cross-examination since Sat
urlay morning," Major Taggart's cross
examination was conculded at "4 1 o'clock
this afternoon. All of â¢ Judge Smyser's
questioning led up to a climax, and, al
though the plaintiff was ms .match at
nearly every point and frequently made
hits, the last efforts of the Judge were
productive of better results.
Major Taggart was led to. Identify a
mass of. about twenty letters which he
had" written to' hlsvwlfelin. most abject
terms, begging that she forgive him and
again live with him. Following "are ex
cerpts from a letter written at Fort Leav
en worth:' .
I never knew, what, it . wa a to be unhappy;
In all these - years I r could see â all day an
affection which made my . home a heav? n ! on
earth. If all the saints had come . below to
say something would come betw-een us I would
never have believed it. I humbly pray to God
that He and you will . forgive me for the part
I have taken in all this. >
And now I ask you to make our paths come
together. I am , the one to make it over again*
and- all I wish you to do is to show me the
way I have â¢ taith in your hard. " common
sense â sense that will take you . and m* and
Culver and Tiddle* through life together. *s
I want to get down on my . knees and plead
as none has ever done for your forgiveness and
your charity. .\ . â¢ - \u25a0'
I knew It, was my awful conduct which made
you to to California and I must make proper
amend? for your gocd. If ever a man has been
nunished for his rash acts by all the tortures
by day and night, I have suffered them.
Some cf the letters . were written In the
hospital, while the plaintiff was recover
ing from ; the ~ shock of separation. In
another letter he says:./ "_
s In the meantime, do not' talk about my. case
and destroy the unfortunate remembrances of
our affair at borne.
The unfortunate remembrances referred
to were torn clothes.
Here Smyser produced a mass of flimsy,
lace-like material, evidently torn into
small shreds, and asked if these were the
clothes his < wife J wore " on that - fateful
night.
"They may* be," answered the - witness.
"The destruction, you : see. Is not my
Taggart said that Colonel Hoff , who
was . General. Miner's envoy, had .urged
him for two; hours. and a half Ur write. to
his wife and urge conciliation. \
Asked if his .wife -had not kept -him
from being court-martialed,* Taggart said
he did not know.
The most sensational incident was when
court opened to-day, arid Judge Smyser,
by placing Mrs. Taggart at one end of a
table tried to show that *it .would have
been; impossible for General, Miner to
have touched Mrs. Taggart's .limbs, at
Fort Leavenworth, as i described In the
proceedings a ; few \u25a0 days j ago. Taggart
went down from the stand, stood between
his wife i and Smyser and said:;
"Oh, this table is not anything like a
dining-room table."
.The way the cotillon was broken up
was described. The . major said Mrs.
Taggart took a small : cream .-pitcher
from the '\u25a0;-. table ' and .- â¢ filled v : it with
whisky.""Kaid the milkman ha<l come,

To all of these Russia has more or
less objected. Besides indemnity and
Saghalien Mr. de Witte will strenuous
ly oppose the surrender of the interned
warships, the limitation on Russia's
naval power and the cession of the
Chinese Eastern Railroad to China.
The article " relating to the Chinese
Eastern Railroad is No. 7 and comes up
at the session to-morrow morning.
CONTENTION" OF THE RUSSIAN'S.
The Russians are prepared with doc
umentary evidence. If the article is not
passed over, to show that the railroad
is a private, corporation owned by the
Russo-Chinese Bank. Mr. Pokotiloff,
oiÂ» of the Russian delegates., was man
ager of the Bank of St. Petersburg until
a few months ago. when he was sent
to Peking as Minister, upon the death
of Paul Lesser. j
Mr. Berger, the attorney of the bank.
Is here and: the tight upon this article
is sure to prove extremely Interesting
and possibly prolonged, as Russia will
contest the Japanese contention that
the Russian Government Is the real
owner of the railroad and that it \u25a0was
built for purely strategic purposes.
The only jar in the sessions of the
conference to-day occurred at the
morning session, when a â¢ rather spir
ited controversy occurred over the
question of the publicity of the pro
ceedings.- Each side manifested a dis
position to charge the other, with re-
Eponsibility for the "leaks". and it was
settled by renewed pledges to observe
the strictest secrecy henceforth regard
ing the proceedings. As. a result the
correspondents to-night experienced ad
ditional difficulty in obtaining,informa
tion.
The discussion on Saghalien went
far enough to-day to demonstrate the
determined opposition of Russia to its
cession and t.iere had been not the

PORTSMOUTH. N. H.. Aug. 15.â 1t became
known to-nignt. that a secret alliance has been
formed or is being formed by the Jewish bank
ers of America, the alliance being gradually
extended to include all the Jewish bankers of
the world. This alliance is directed toward
enforcing justice for the Jews of Russia by the
Czar and unless this be guaranteed by prompt
action, unmistakably sincere in its Intent,
every Jewish banking-house in.the^world will
be closed to Russia.
The ' Kishsnev massacre aroused the Jews of
the world, crystallized sentiment and deter
mined them to selxe the first opportunity to
make Russia feel the Jewish power..
So lon* as Russia treats Jews unjustly and
as apart and Â«c partite from her other subjects,
so lons will American Jewish Lackers refuse
to loan their money to Russia, and they have
made it plain that not only are they acting In
conjunction with other Jewish banking houses
throughout the world, but that money will be
loaned only for peace and not for war.
PORTSMOUTH, ST. H., An*-. 13. â TJbe
crisis, la the peace negotiation*, upon
which; the eyes of the world are fas
tened. Is npproavhlnsr rapidly and the
end of this week or the flrÂ«t of next
wffk, at the latent, should witness the
deadlock and end If the conference la
to go to pieces.
Two more of the twelve articles. Nos.
IV and VI. were disposed of to-day.
Article 4 consist of mutual pledges to
observe the integrity of China and the
policy of the "open door" for the com
merce of all nations, and article 6
covers the surrender of the Russian
leases to the Liaotung Peninsula. Port
Athur. Dalny and the Blonde and El
liott islands.
To article 4 both parties gave ready
essent and the official statement of the
adoption of that article took care to
state that it was agreed to "unani
mously."
Article 5. the consideration of which
was passed until later, provides for the
cession of the island of Saghalien.
Discussion appearing useless at this
stage, on account of the firm negative
given in the Russian reply, it was de
cided, upon the motion of the Japanese,
to defer its discussion, thus revealing
the Japanese intention of postponing
to the end the life and death strug
gle.
MAY REACH A COMPROMISE.
This is the usual procedure followed
in diplomatic nes-otiations. enabling the
negotiators to come to an aecord^upon
all possible points before tackling the
crucial issues, and the fact that the Rus
sians acquiesced^ in the proposition
BhOWS that they, too, are as careful and
as anxious are are the Japanese that
the world should not accuse them of
being responsible for precipitating the
break, if break there is to be. and
wrecking the conference. This, in it
self, is a hopeful sig:i. Besides, by
postponing the burning questions to
the end, the psychological moment for
bargain and compromise arrives. Then,
hurriedly, the last trump cards and
the game is done.
And there is growing hope of com
premise. To the closest observers the
final solution begins to crystallize quite
naturally â the Russians yielding the
cession of Saghalien. Japan foregoing
"the cost of the war," but taking com
pensation in the money to be refunded
to Japan by China on account of the
transfer to her of the Chinese Eastern
Railroad. v.-hich. Russia contends, be
longs to a private corporation and
therefore is unconfiscable by Japan;
the Russian Government property in
Port Arthur and Dalny and remunera
tion for the maintenance of the 100,000
Russian prisoners in Japan.
According to the Russian view Japan
has already secured all and more than
she dreamed of claiming before the
war. To insist upon a foe who lias
Â«t!il half a million men confronting
her in the field footing the bill for the
cost of the war the price of peaec
\u25a0would, the Russians say, change the
character of the military struggle
henceforth frdTn one for certain prin
ciples to one for the exaction of "blood
money."

VICTORIA, B. C. ..Aug. IB. â George
D. Collins, the leva/iting San Francisco
lawyer, being tried for extradition for
perjury before Judge Lampman, while
on the witness 'stand. to-day In his own
defense, spoke for about .two hours,
detailing a conspiracy which he claims
was launched at San Francisco to rail
road him to Jail and from which ha
fled to Victoria. He said the conspiracy
was launched by the Hlbernla Bank,
and aided by Judges Lawler. Kerrigan
and â¢ Graham, the Grand Jury im
paneled at San Francisco by Judge
Lawler, the Bar Association and the-
San Francisco Chronicle. Call, Exam
iner and Bulletin, newspapers.
'He aroused their enmity, ho declared,
because of ; his aggressiveness on the
part of clients in having offended
Judges and lawyers by securing? the
release of clients on various grounds
after juries had convicted them. He
declared, the Judges were antagonistic
A.o him because he reversed some of
their decisions, among others that of
Judge Morrow, convicting Williams, a
customs inspector, of importing Chi
nese women, and because of which
Judge Morrow had .stated he fixed up
the record. He detailed many casea
he had In San Francisco where he se
cured the release of accused after their
conviction on technicalities, notably thÂ«
case of Turner, accused of swindling,
who was afterward shot and killed by
a victim in front of Collins' office, and
Hunsted and others accused of being
in league with the then Public Admin
istrator to loot the John Sullivan estate
by producing a false heir. He said
because of his having secured the re
lease of these persons he had been at
tacked by press, bar and pulpit of San
Francisco and incurred the enmity of
Judges.
They were also antagonistic to him
because he was instrumental In pre
venting- the police by legal means from
raiding houses of prostitution and
gambling houses and because he se
cured the removal of Police Commis
sioner Hutton with Mayor Schmitz's as
sistance. He said that It was al
leged by those arrayed In conspiracy
against him that" he was a lawyer of
the Schmitz administration. 7-.-
The Hlbernia Bank started the prose
cution against him said Collins, because
while representing a claim against the
Robinson estate upon which ,tbe bank
had a mortgage he found the mortgage
had^been lost. He was threatened with
disbarment' proceedings by the bank
unless he desisted from the action.
When his wife, Agnes Newman, died,
she had an : account" I ' ln the Hlbernia
Bank which she assigned to him and
he made, affidavit af the bank in -with
drawing the money. Liter; after hi 3
wife"s â¢ death; " William Newman, "her
brother,- offered his services to the Hl
bernia. Bank â¢ because witness would
not give him part' of the. money and
stated falsely witness had married his
sister Cnarlotta instead of Agnes. , Col
linn asserted, the charge of bigamy was
instituted a.', the Instance of the Hlber
nia Bank people, taose interested In
publishing the San Francisco Chronicle.
Judges Lawler, Kerrigan -and to some
extent Judge Graham, who was against
him because he collected a debtfroman
actor named Thomson, who was Gra
ham's friend, by arresting him when on
the stage of. the Columbia Theater at
-San Francisco, attired as Richelieu.
Newman had gone before the Grand
Jury ami the present prosecution re
sulted, from which he fled. .
In cross-examination by "Frank Hig
gins for the State of California, he
strenuously denied the marriage with
Charlotta. Collins and said that all the
evidence given there anent by Thomas
Curran, William Newman and the depo
sitions of Charlotta and. Florence New
man were absolutely false. The New
mans sought to blackmail him. he said.
If doctors had sworn they had been
present at the. birth of the children of
Charlotta Collins, they had perjured
themselves. The children now with
Charlotta Collins were the Issue of hts
marriage with Agnes Newman and hi 3
friends at San Francisco would pro
vide for them until he ; was out of the
meshes of this conspiracy.
The cross-examination of Collins will
be continued tofmorrow.

PORTSMOUTH, N. R, Aug. 15.â Two more of the twelve
peace articles were disposed of to-day. The belief is growing that
Russia, after all the minor issues have been disposed of, will flatly
refuse to pay indemnity, and, unless Japan recedes, will withdraw her
plenipotentiaries and proclaim to the world that her adversary is no
longer fighting for, principle, but for "blood money." Both missions to
day agreed to observe the integrity of China and the "open-door" policy.

OAKLAND, Aug. 15.â Mrs. L. Siebe,
the wife of Captain L. Siebe of this city,
became violently insane while on the
special train of the Oakland Board of
Trade on her way to the Lewis and
Clark Exposition at Portland and on
her arrival at that city was at once
taken to a private sanitarium. Mrs.
Siebe was accompanied by her husband
and two daughters, Mrs. J. J. Evers and
Miss Louise Siebe. Without the slight
est warning she suddenly became vio
lent and it required the assistance of
several peo"ple to place her under con
trol. Dr. H. P. Miller was on the train
and Mrs. Siebe was placed in his charge.
On her arrival at Portland she was
taken at once to the sanitarium.
The physicians in charge oC the case
ascribe Mrs. Slebe's attack to the ex
treme heat and the excitement attend
ing the trip. They are of the opinion
that she will recover in a short time.

contracts taken since that date will be consid

This morning the plumbers working on a

was being hauled to the place by an "unfair'"
team. As this work is a part of the proposed

Church said, would probably sue the

The Board of Police and Fire Com

sion to-morrow to take such action

matter of the charge made by Mrs. L.

kins $1000 to "square" the Biroth case.
Mrs. Harrison will be given opportu
nity to make her complaint before the
board. Hodgkins has prepared his de
fense and says he desires an early
hearing.
No action has been taken by \ the
Commissioners as to a possible suc
cessor to Chief of Police Hodgkins in
case he should be relieved of his pres
ent position. Conferences among the
Commissioners have resulted only in
a decision that all charges against the
Chief must first be cleared up one way
or another before further steps can be
taken. If Hodgkins expresses a de
sire to step out and take his old posi
tion of detective the request will un
doubtedly be granted by the board in
case he should be exonerated.
OAKLAND. Aug. 15. â To be cast into

a $7500 prize winning lottery tii-ket
thÂ« mutilation of which, as permitted,
it was charged, by Chief of Police
Hodgkins. has been a source fpr weeks
of much inquiry at police headiuartorj.
The order of destruction was made !.Â»y
Police Judge Mortimer Smith to-day
otter hearing the proceedings on a
RÂ»;.rcl> v,-arrant sworn out by John
Perry, from whom the ticket was tak- n
1 y the r-olice.
The testimony of Chief Hodgkins
was in lir.e with his official statement
to the Police Commissioners mih sov
*ral ago. Hodgkins declared he
pcim'.ued ajrents of the comnany to
tJke the ticket, supposing they Intend
<?d nnrely to stamp a canceling mirk
on li. When D. Bibbero, manager â¢'\u25a0Â£
t^e con-puny, quickly tore out the. num
bers, tlie Chief exclaimed:
"My God, what have you done?"
Bibbero explained, according to
Hodpltins, that this was the way the
company canceled its dead tickets.
Otto L. Hasse, the manager of the
Central News Store, who was ' taken
with a violent attack of nervousness
when* the Investigation was at first
started and was unable to be present,
is, now in attendance. He Is the one
who had the malting out of the bills
and .swore at the -time of the filing that
they were true and correct. He ha 3
been the manager of the Central News
Company's store for a number of years.
While the Board of Supervisors are
conducting their investigation the
Grand Jury now has its expert making
a complete tabulation of the entire mat-
Ur and It is expected that when It
meets next Thursday it will .j push a
vigorous investigation with a view to
bringing Indictments against tho.ie who
are responsible.
"No, sir; wÂ« never use that pen. We
have never had four boxes of that kind
of pens."
"Did you on that date purchase this
kind of a pen?" showing another kind.
â¢No." "'._-â¢
"Did you order six dozen bank stock
pads?"
"I have not had any In the office
for six months."
By comparing the bills with the orig
inal orders it is shown that in these
ways Grimm's bill, which totaled up
J3SB 4S for six months, had been
stuffed to the amount of $72 90 and as
it now stands it has been cut to $265 58.
In this manner the bills in every county
officer have been inflated with the ex
ception of County Assessor . Dalton,
who says that his bills are all right.
Notwithstanding this, however,. County
Expert Sabin has trimmed his bills
down $480 for six months, as it is
stated that it is utterly impossible for
him to have used the amount of stuff
he has received and he has no supply
on hand.
HASSE ATTEXDSSESSIOX.
SAME IN* EVERY, OFFICE.
"No. sir."- : .-.
"Did you buy four gross of stub
pens on that date?"
"Did you buy twelve gross of rubber
bands on that date?"
Another and a more serious manner
in which the officials have been taken
advantage of is shown in the duplicate
charges. Recorder Grimm was shown
where he had purchased a list of sup
plies, consisting of 'rubber bands, pen
cils,- etc., charged for two months In
succession. He admitted that the ar
ticles had been received but once, but
said there had been a double charge
made. The only way he could account
for it was that when the second_.bin
had been presented at the office he re
membered receiving the goods which
were probably in use at the time, and
supposing f the man to be honest, placed
his O. K. on ttie requisition. ' ! "' r '
Still another way that his bills had
been raised was by. the Insertion ;of
items that were never purchased. ' '
'"Did you purchase two gross of. Ko-r
hlnoor pencils on January 2, 1905?" was
asked by Hynes.
"No, sir," was the reply. \u25a0\u25a0_\u25a0 ,
"It looks as if that item had been
changed from six to ten.. There has
been an erasure" and the figures are
changed. I would like to state right
now that no bill has ever passed
through my hands with such marks
upon It."
BILL, IS CHANGED.
"Has there been any change made
In the bill since it received your O. K.?"
asked Deputy District Attorney Hynes.
His attention was then called to the
bill of January 24 and asked if the
bill, when- it was presented to him for
his signature, corresponded as to items
with his" book. He answered that it
did.
* OAKLAND, Aug. 15. â The investiga
tion begun by the Board of Supervis
ors into the alleged raising of the sta
tionery bills developed at this after
noon's hearing that the bills of County
Recorder Grimm had been* tampered
with and duplicate charges made of the
good 3 delivered. Recorder Grimm has
a book In which he keeps a record of
all the supplies that â¢he orders and
upon comparing the bills for several
months, he finds, first, that he "has been
charged for the same supplies several
months In succession and secondly,
that orders for goods have been raised.
Specific instances of this occurred
In the orders for gold seals. Grimm
stated that he had ordered 100 of them,
while the bill read 1000. On January
16 he is charged up with one gross of
cork -penholders, which his book
showed should have been a half-gross.
On January IV, he says, he ordered two
boxes of envelopes, whereas, the
charge is two gross. On the same date
he is charged with a dozen balls of
Manila twine and he said he got three
balls. â¢ â¢

land" or the erection â¢" of building*. If the
station authorities insist on maintaining sub
stations after we have advised the withdrawal
of the Hatch fund from them, we can ask
the Treasury to withhold further payment of
the Hatch \u25a0 fund until we have reirorted the
matter to Congress.'/ iWJ â¢ ->< .Â»;-; .
Sixth â The maintenance of permanent sub
stations endangers our revenue from -\u0084 the
Hatch funds. \u25a0 We have been in conflict with
the Department of Agriculture for years on
this subject, and are now likely to be called
sharply to account for using: thÂ© Hatch funds
In this way. In a letter written June 26.
IDOS Dr. A. C. True, Director of the Office of
Experiment Stations of the United States De
partment of Agriculture, says:
"Congress is insisting on a more strict ex
penditure of the Hatch fund. I hope, there
fore, that, as far as possible, _ you will be able
to make an arrangement by which the Hatch
fund can be withdrawn * from the sub
stations.
Fourth â The discontinuance of a sub-station
does not mean that we art -fOTÃaklnjc work
In a district, or locality. It simply means
that we are proceeding . In a more direct
and rapid way to serve the whole State
(and that locality as a part of It) by send
ing our men and eaulpment for limited pe
riods to the very, places where they . can do
the best and most useful work for agricultural
eclence or practice, or for both. ' â¢ v
Fifth â The diversion of money from the
maintenance of permanent sub-atatlons is not
for the purpose of ' expending it- at the cen
tral station, but It Is for the purpose of ex
tending investigation in every direction and
Into more pressing subjects.
SecondâAs the station work of the uni
versity has expanded, as many unanticipated
lines of investigation have forcibly suggested
themselves, . and aa the demand for special
work has arisen among many classes of pro
ducers In various parts of the State, the syÂ«
tem of permanent BUb-stations has been found
to be cumbersome, inelastic and expensive,
and to interfere â¢ with proper direction o* our
effort and expenditures to accomplish the
greatest good in scientific discovery and in
practical helD to farmers in their difficult
problems. . We equipped ourselves with able
men, but have not been able to Ret the most
out of them because the \u25a0 funds which they
should work with bave been consumed in
maintenance of permanent stations which are
neither praiseworthy in appearance nor ade
quately productive of valuable results.
Thirdâ lt is a plain teaching of experience
that the \u25a0 Investigator must undertake his
problem wbere It actually exists and in the
environment which surrounds it, and our most
significant results have been reached \u25a0 where
we have secured the use of property, during
its usefulness, 1 : for lnvestlgational purposes, ana
no longer.
First â It was never the intention â¢. to main
tain these establishments perpetually. They
Were intended to continue indefinitely â their
existence to be determined by their u sef "J*
ness. In accordance with this. view two other
stations established at the same time have
already been discontinued.
' BERKELEY, .Aug. 15.â Professor E.
J. Wickson, dean of the agricultural
college, issued an official statement to
day giving an account of the college's
policy with respect , to discontinuing
sub-stations, which hitherto have been
maintained In various parts of the
State.- At a meeting of the Regents
last Tuesday citizens of Tulare pro
tested against tho of
the . sub-station of the* university near
that city. Their arguments are be
lieved by Professor Wickson to be fully
answered in the following statement lie
has issued: \u25a0

America- has- always welcomed the thrifty
and Industrious Immigrant who is anxious to
avail himself of the- privilege of American
citizenship .< and apprecates Its responalbiltlcs.
But we must call a halt to 'the. class which
cannot assimilate and which would undermine
our Institutions. â¢ â¢
Of the M 2.570 immigrants arriving in 1904
over COO.OOO entered at- the port of New York
and less than 10,000 at Californian ports. Re
siding in this State if is difficult for us to
fully appreciate the menace of European im
migration which is brought so strikingly homo
to the residents of the Atlantic seaboard.
Neither can many of our Eastern friends
understand |or appreciate our attitude lrÂ» re
gard to Asiatic immigration. California has
but nine Congressmen. Pennsylvania has
thirty-two members of the House of Repre
sentatives, and in that entire State, accord
ing to the Federal census of 1900. there aro
but forty Japanese. Illinois has
members of the lower house of _Congress. and
In that State the""3apanese" population Is but
eighty. Ohio contains but twenty-seven Jap
anese. I mention these facts to call attention
to the conditions which the California delega
tion in Congress' is bound to face.
\u25a0President Roosevelt is sound on the immi
gration question. In one of his messages to
Congress he uses these words:' "It is vital
that we should keep high; the standard of
well being among ouy..wagt,;'. tl9}orkers,t 1 9}orkers, and
thcwfptÃ we should twl^adjoH'jejasses of men
who*e*Â«Â«n\Uriis ot/Wng: ani.l^hose personal
cystoms and . habits , are \u25a0 such that they tend
to lower the level \u25a0of . the 'American wage
worker; and above all we' should not admit
any man of an unworthy type." His words
certainly strongly apply to the type of Asiatics
against whom Callfornians are contending:
1 wish every merchant, every mechanic and
every laboring; man throughout the United
Ptates totild find the time to carefully Btudy
the startling Ufrures issued by. the Commis
sioner General of Immigration, for they cer
tainly furnish food for the most . serious
thought. During the month of April of this
year 137.09* immigrants entered the United
States, a daily average of over 4569, an in
crease of 45,771 over the corresponding month
of 19<5i. For the nine â¢- months ending with
March Cst>.:OT allen3 landed upon our soil/ an
increase of over 100,000 compared with the
corresponding period in 1594. For the fiscal
year ending June. 11)04. the total arrivals were
512.5"0. an increase of over 500,000 compared
wlth'lÂ«o4 a decade ago.
Of the immigrants arriving during the fiscal
year 19U4 1W.003 could neither read nor: write
and 801.5J0 brought with them lees than $50
cash. These figures certainly demonstrate that
our present 1 laws are not adequate to check
the increasing tide of immigration or improya
the quality of aliens who are dally being ad
mitted. nearly every session of Con
gress more Btringent laws are proposed, but
powerful opposition from many of the great
Atlantic eteamshlp companies has too fre
quently resulted in the defeat of needed legis
lation, these companies fearing that a profit
able source of revenue would be interfered
with. It has taken years of patient and per
sistent effort to place upon the statute books
the restrictive measures , now in force, and
unless public sentiment, the most potent of
factors in shaping legislation, becomes thor
oughly aroused little improvement can be hoped
for In the future.
Of the various problems now confronting the
American people the Immigration question \u25a0!â¢
one of tbe most serious. While Ido not under
estimate the importance of the railway rate
kgiislauon, tariir revision, the ratification by
the Senate of pending treaties and other isauea
now being generally discussed by individuals
and press, the immigration question is cer
talniy deserving- of as serious consideration.
ALAMEDA. Aug. 15. â Congressman- J.
R. "Knowland delivered an address to
night before the Unitarian Club upon
immigration.- The Congressman made
a strong point in showing by "figures
how the East was menaced by Euro
pean immigration, while the. West was
menaced by Oriental immigration, and
that each section had its dangers from
the influx of a foreign population. He
said: \u25a0'\u25a0\u25a0\u0084''\u25a0 . '\u25a0 , .

PORTLAND, Aug. 15. â Poolselllng at
the Irvington race track was declared
unlawful by Judge. A. L. Frazer thi3
morning in a decision handed down in
the Circuit Court. Judge Frazer made
permanent the temporary injunction
granted. a week ago that restrained thÂ«
bookmakers at Irvington, from selling
pools and over which the court heard
many arguments.
. As a result of Judge Frazer*s deci
sion, the oncers of the Multnomah Fair
Association, which controls the course,
state they will have no more racing,
claiming that without betting it would
be unprofitable. The decision was
handed down in the casÂ« of Elizabeth
Ryan, owner of the track, against tho
Multnomah Fair Association, its les
seed, for an order enjoining: said les
sees from conducting any sort of a
gambling game at the races. The cases
will be tried in the Circuit Court on
September 7. If it should result in
favor of the Fair Association, Whitney
L. Boise, one of the attorneys for tho
Association, says an action for dam
ages will be begun immediately against
Mrs. Ryan for injury to their business
by keeping 1 people from their race meet
and also by causing injury to tha rac
ing business in general.
Judge Frazer stated he rendered tha
decision with reluctance, as he had a
feeling the case was brought to satisfy
private revenge. Ha would have pre
ferred It to come before him sitting a*
a criminal court. He said the evidence
before him was not such as would
substantiate the theory that the case
was not brought in good faith, and he
must confine himself to the rules of
law in rendering a decision. Captain
Spencer, attorney in fact for Mrs. Ryan,
was not an interested party in the case
from a legal standpoint, and what hÂ«
said- and did could not show bad faith
on the part of the plaintiffs.
The stopping of racing effects many
horsemen who depended on their sta
bles for a livelihood.
FINANCE COMMITTEE.
FINDS A SOLUTION
Means AVliereby Supervisors
May I?eturn Illegally
Collected Taxes.
The Finance Committee of the Board
of Supervisors will recommend to the
board when the business sessions are re
sumed next month that a resolution be
passed for the purpose of granting relief
to those property owners who have lost
their receipted tax bills for the year 1302.
The object of the resolution is to enable
such property owners to recover from the
city the special levy made in that year
for schools and hospitals, which waa de
clared illegal by the Supreme Court.
Under a recent amendment to the code
property owners who had failed to pro
test within six months against the pay
ment of the special tax were empowered
to do so within three years from the date
of payment. The time limit will expire In
November, and the Finance Committee
desires to return the taxes to all property
owners who have paid them.
. Auditor Baehr has already refunded
some $250,000 of the taxes, but requires
the receipted tax bills to be presented to
him before be will issue a demand for
the special taxes to be returned. Baehr
is- upheld in this course by the Board of
Supervisors, but at a recent conference
it was agreed that after the major por
tion of the , taxes have been paid back
steps will be taken to reimburse those
who have lost their bills but who are
marked paid on the assessment roll for
the year named. The amount to be re
turned in that manner will aggregate
several thousands of dollars.

The bases were usually occupied, but
by sensational fielding and ciever pitch
ing on the part of Oscar Graham and
Fitzgerald no runs, were made until Oak
land scored in the eighth. Van then sin
gled and scored on a sacrifice and a hit. '
The game looked to be over when Shee
han, the first \ man up for Tacoma, flew
out In the ninth. Nordyke followed with
a two-base hit to center. Lynch could
do nothing; and .it was up to , Mc-
Laughlin for a base hit. Here Graham
made a mistake . by walking McLaughlin,
as Casey* straightened one out that went
to the 'right field fence for a three-bagger,
scoring two runs. .

playing. With the game apparently lost,
Tacoma went to . bat in the ninth, and
with a, couple of well-placed hits they
ended the inning with one to the good. It
looked gloomy for Rip's men, as Fitzger
ald was winging them over in a master
ful manner/ but Oakland surprised those
who. were lucky enough to be there by
going, right to it and batting out a vic
tory without a' man going down. Score â
Oakland 3," Tacoma 2.
The game was full of peculiar and sen
sational plays, probably more than are
seen in six ordinary games. In the first
two innings Oakland succeeded in get
ting two men. on bases without - scoring.
An unusual double play was made in the
fifth, when McLaughlin occupied second
and Graham was ,on the , initial - sack.
Both of . them were doubled , on a single
by Hogan. McLaughlin started home
from secdnd and was caught between the
bags. The whole, team tried to run him
down, and finally Dunleavy caught him.
The ball was quickly thrown to second
and Graham was caught in a like manner
by Dunleavy. In this play six of, the Oak
land team were 'credited with assists.

TO-DAY'S GA3IES.
SARATOGA, Aug. 15.â The Merchants'
and Citizens' handicap was the feature
of to-day's racing card. Â» Had ' there
been a fine day the whole village would
have turned out, but bad weather held
the crowd back. Only about eight thou
sand spectators passed the turnstiles.
The lightly weighted Outcome upset
many calculations in the handicap. She
just ran over the public ; choices
through the stretch and won by several
lengths from Proper. and Dolly Spanker.
Proper was iuterferred with on the far
turn, where he and Outcofne were
thrown back. The latter got the worst
of it and was much the best. Dolly
Spanker did well, but tired on the way
home. Lord of the Vale also stopped.
Caughnawaga could not do himself jus
tice in the heavy going. Burns claimed
a foul against Spanker, but it was not
allowed. Summary:

RESULTS OF GAMES.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
The All-California team is composed
of the fastest riders of five- of the most
important cypling clubs around the
bay and. they will go to Nevada imtmed
with the spirit of "do or die." Owing
to the faot that the men composing the
team are the pick of the best men of
the State, the Reno club, of course, has
the privilege of also securing men
from other clubs, in Nevada. This
makes the coming contest an inter
state race, rather than One ' between
clubs. â¢ *
: Following are the clubs represented
and the members of the team:
â¢ Oakland Wheelmen â Don Trego, H.
Bente and J. Lucio; Garden City Wheel
men â t. Waible and D. Fabacher;New
Century Wheelmen *â Dave Mainland
and McWhlrter; Bay City Wheelmen â
Long and McLaughlin; Central City
Wheelmenâ Lawrence and T. MoGrath.
OAKLAND, Aug. IB.â Determined, to
retrieve the laurel* lost by repeated de
feats at the hands of the Reno "Wheel
men, by defeating them on their own
track, "the various cycling clubs of the
cities about the bay have planned to
form a Joint relay team of the best
riders in each club, which will be sent
to Reno to make an effort to wrest the
championship of the Pacific CoaÂ«t from
the tenacious grtpot the Sagebrushers.
The members of the combination team,
which ' will bÂ«: known ."as the All-Call
fornias, have already . been . selected and
the team will leave for Reno on Sun
day, the 27th Inst, in charge of Mcl
Moffltt, captain of tha Oakland Wheel
men. - .
Both the fighters are due from the
mountains to-day. They will settle down
in their training quarters within the next
twenty-four hours.
The $2500 forfeits of each man and of
the promoting club have been posted with
Harry Corbett, the stakeholder.
A committee of business men from
Colma' made -up o/ Benjamin Green,
James . Casey, and "VV. H. Almon : waited
upon Manager â¢ Jim Coffroth yesterday,
and -gave -reasons why he' should carry
out his plans as: originally made. -''..They
told him- a; petition' was- being sighed 'by
residents of San Mateo County showing
they are in favor of the affair.
A second committee from the Native
Sons . appointed ; at Sacramento on Mon
day had not communicated with Manager
Coffroth' up to a late hour { last night.
The 'actual site for the arena has not
been selected. There; is a choice of three
locations.- One of theseis on the county
road in Union; Coursing Park and directly
opposite thepresent grand stand. Another
Is on the east' side of the* county road
where it descends abruptly from Colma.
This is a sheltered place and is a natural
amphitheater. The working plans have all
been prepared and the lumber ordered, so
that all the; preparations for building are
well advanced. . '\u25a0â¢'.''

Xavy Transport La^rton Arrive*.
Crowded with b!uÂ«-jackett, most of whom
have but a few months more to serve Uncle
Â£atr.. the navy transport Lawton. Captain W\
Winder, arrived yesterday from Manila. The
Lawtcn calltd at Guam and at Honolulu, re
training about five days at the latter port.
Formerly the Lawton was an army transport.
She wag transferred to the r-avy, refitted to
suit her new work, and has just ended her first
raani trip under navy management. She Is
not a large vessel, but she crought across the
Jaciflc thirty cabin passengers and 609 blue-
Jackets. It Â«as < lose quarters, but good dlsci
fiine was maintain*-* and the transport arrived
*ith all hands in good spirits. Jack made the
most of fcie lack of elbow room, and between
otficers and men the utmost good will seemed
to prevail.
Among the jackles are four very fine singers,
who combined on the Lawton to make a quar
tet, of which Captiln Winder Is very proud.
At Honolulu the Lawton quartet made a great
tit and It Is pos&ible. when they get their dlÂ»
chargt* that the four bluejackets may ship on
some vaudeville circuit for a cruise about the
continent. . : _' ...
The Lawton will probably go to Mare Island
to-day and there prepare for another trip to
the Orient. " .
The officers of the Lawton are: Commander
V.' Winder, .commanding; Lieutenant Ccm
rr.ar.der John C. Leonard, executive officer;
Lieutenant L. Shane, navy officer; Ensign C.

The great novelist says that you can travel over all Russia and
question -the peasants and find that the same complaint is every
where. Their condition is so hard becaust they lack bread, and
the reason they lack bread is because there is no land. That is the
thing for which they unceasingly hope and of which they unceas
ingly think. He likens this method of land holding which he de
plores.to a people driving a herd of. cows, on the milk products of
which they must subsist, into a small inclosure," where they soon eat
and tramp up all the limited pasture and grow so thin they chew
each others' tails. Outside the inclosure there is abundance' of land
that would plentifully supply the cattle, but it is; us,ed for other
than food purposes â plants for making dyes, tobacco plantations,
race courses, lawn tennis grounds, parks and flowers! Then the
people who depend on the milk of these cows begin to try experi
ments to make them give more without furnishing them the natural
means, namely, more pasture. They build sheds over them, gild
their horns, comb them with wet brushes, invent improved methods
of milking and of taking care of old and invalid cows. '
Tolstoi holds that the non-admission to the land of those who
are in need of it is a sin, and he desires to make that a truth recog
nized by all men. One fault he finds in the difficulties put. in the
way of the peasants getting land to till is that because of this lack
of land they are forced to go to work at other tilings and men
profit by this enforced labor which is compelled -by the deprivation
of what he considers the peasants' legitimate right to the land. If
he advocated such a position here, it would be considered being a
disciple of Henry George. No doubt the condition of the Russian
peasant is so severely different from that of the- agricultural worker
here that we cannot judge the urgency of (his demand by our stand
ards. Free land to the Russian ruralist may mean the only way to
avoid being tialf fed all the year,. and the greed ; of the autocrats*
may rob them of all the profits of their toil beyond a bare sub
sistence. .
r "pÂ»OLSTOI writes a long letter to the London Times in which
j he pictures the hardships of the Russian peasantry as so severe
\u25a0*\u25a0 the whole civilized world should pity them. He says the great
question for them is not how to improve their position, but how
not to die of hunger. He blames their hungry condition upon the
Government and thinks the system of land tenure is what prevents
the people from having abundance of food. He plainly calls this
land system a great iniquity and thinks that the ruling class should
be as much ashamed of it as they gradually grew to be of holding
serfs before the time of liberation came.

The League could not have been formed on a variety of issues,
because that introduces differences and divisions. On the one issue
it is united. Again, it is clearly seen that taking up favorably any
issue made by the grafters strengthens them. They will imme
diately assert that it is an indorsement of their position, and will
ask people to come into the main tent and stay out of the side
show. Their trained bawlers will make the streets vocal with that
statement of the situation. The result will be confusion in the
public mind, in which the main duty of the people will be lost
sight of and forgotten. ;
The Asiatic question is not an issue. To make an issue there
must be difference of opinion, intention, purpose and practice.
Even- one knows that there is no such difference on this subject as
to furnish ground for an issue. The lack of such difference ac
counts for the public indifference to the pseudo tocsin ringing
that is being done by a few repudiated politicians and professional
alarmists. Every man of sense knows that no national question is
involved in this campaign. While the van is led by the Republican
League, the principles of the national Republican party are not at
stake at all in the result. Locally that party, happens to be in the
majority and only its local morality and practices are at stake, not
its national principles and policies. As the strongest organized
instrument of political action, it offers its might to effect reform
in the municipal government, and asks all good citizens to second
its efforts to that end alone., By fellowshipping such allies it aban
dons none of its allegiance to the national party, nor do its allies
take on such allegiance. The general alignment of parties will re
main as they were, while men join hands to fight a common enemy
of all parties, a foe of all government. Let this one issue be made
and made unmistakably plain.
The Republican League was not organized, has not worked
and has not won in order that it may take up any but the main
issue. When it wins in November it has a job of weeding that will
occupy it for some time. It will compel respect for the civil ser
vice system. It will displace every grafter, sending many into pri
vate life and some to prison, and in the end will create a government
that the people can trust with whatever responsibility they choose to
put in its keeping. " ' J^-
Concerning ptiblic ownership, the grafters' administration will
soon have been in power four years. In that time the question has
been twice submitted to the people, and they have twice refused to
trust the administration in the management of public utilities. What
is the use of making that an issue? Of course the grafters' party
favors it, because it means more graft. Give them control of
water, light and street railroads, and their cinch on the city would
be permanent. They want it to last, and therefore they are for
public ownership. There are others who favor that policy also.
There are many friends of decent government who are led by the
academic discussion . of the subject to favor the municipalizing of
certain public utilities. But they see clearly that the first prelim
inary is a change in the municipal administration. They see also
lhat "such change is the sole issue now before the people of this city.
There is no other. The importing of other issues means the obscur
ation of that. The Republican League was formed on that sole
issue. With that only as its war club, it organized the city, pene
trated every precinct, roused the voters to make the largest registra
tion in the city's history, and cast the largest vote ever thrown at a
primary.
The grafters were probably never busier than now, when they
appear to be idle. They hold "their forces intact. Their vote is a
minority of the total to be cast in November, but they hope for re
cruits, to be gained by issues they will make. It is # at this mo
ment evident that they intend to make a high declaration in favor
of municipal ownership of public utilities. They are also endeavor
ing to offer themselves as the only Simon-pure anti-Asiatics. Of
IMMEDIATELY following the late primary election there was
no idle exultation on the part of the Republican League/ but
1 there was much 'bluffing on the part of the beaten grafters.
They announced that they really had won. Their leader publicly
patted himself on the back, raised his hat to his conception of his
own greatness, and pretended to give out a programme for con
trolling the convention. Since then a calm has fallen upon the
outward aspect of municipal politics. But it is an appearance only.
The Republican League appreciates the situation as outlined in The
Call after the victory. Only the first line of entrenchments has
been carried. It is a" long march to the citadel and there is hard
fighting on the way.

The Ptate authorities are Â«.11l in control
and p..)**es.-:or. of :ne valley. At the last
cession of Ccr.Bre6* Senatcr Perkins intro
duced a bill ScceDtlnsr the recession of the
valley end appropriating J25.000 for its sup
port for the year. This passed the Senate,
but the Hcufr struck out the clause accept
ing the recession, leaving the appropriation.
This the State authorities have construed to
mean tbat they are stili In possession. Cap
tain Benson of the Fourth Cavalry. Acting Su
perintendent of the National Park, attempted
to take ivs^eMlon of the valley, but Guardian
George Har'.ow ordered the man of war out
a*d the man of war obeyed the order, after
he had telegraphed to Washington. Secretary
Hitchcock has recently appointed a special
commissioner to visit the Yosemite and
make a report preparatory to his taking con
trol of the valley should Congress accept the
recession, which It will undoubtedly do thti
tall. Then will come Senatcr Curttn's fight
In the courts.
There is gqing to be a legal test of ihe
validity of the recession cf the Yosemite Val
ley to the Federal Government. This has teen
definitely decided upon by State Senator J. B.
Curtin of Sonora. who is the leader of the
oppcsit:on to this move. There have been
tr.:fcb.ts to this effect, but they have always
been regarded as a little misty and uncer
tain. It can now be asserted positively that
there will be a legal contest over this act,
that this contest will be carried to the Su
preme Court of thfe United States and that
Senator Curtin ha* a definite plan already
mapped out.
Senator Curtin is going to let the Federal
Government take the first steps toward taking
possession of the valley, and he will then
r.gnt to regain possession through injunction
proceedings. It is fully expected that Con
gress will pass a bill accepting the valley from
the State of California, in accordance with
the act of the last Legislature, which was
given the sanction of Governor Pardee. The
Interior Department, which has charge of
the national parks, will then take possession.
Senator Curtin wlli nle Injunction proceeding!
against the Interior Department, Congress and
&ii Federal clticl&la who are interested in the
move to prevent them taking control of the
valley. Th* ground cf hlÂ» proceeding will DÂ«
that the State Legislature had no richt to
turr. over to the Federal Government build
ings and land that the State had paid for.
When the Yosemite Valley Â«v given to the
State of California there were several pre
emption titles in the vaJley. Enterprising
pioneers had located as Government land some
o? the wonders of that section. The late J.
M. Hutching* had the Yosemite Kalis ir. his
back yard end hla title to that had to be
bought by the State, while another pioneer by
the name of Lemon owned the Hal' Dome,
end hit title to that had to be purchased.
Senator Curtin now holds that this property
belongs to the State by purchase from thÂ«
owners and that these portions, at least, cf
the valley cannot be turned back to the na
tional Government without Â»cmc return being
made to the State,

money which he~~had received, but had
kept 'part of it -nearly'.* a year. Dr.

not turned it over because he did not
trust the treasurer in the lijjrht of
stories told him by Dr. Cooland by the
expert who examined the books.
Dr. Mayhew swore that he did not

fessor Howard before the examination
and that he had had no communica
tion with him since last December.

Next Convention of Order
Special Dispatch to The Call.
DENVER, An^r. 13.â The fight Jor . thÂ« .
grand presidency . Qt Uxe, Fraternal Order "
of Eagles -is becoming the hottest ever
known in a Grand Aerie. The arrival of
the San Francisco and other California
delegations this morning and their in
sistence that BernardrF. McGinty of Chi
cago enter the race for the highest offlca
complicated matters. McGinty Is chair
man of the board of grand trustees, and
from the way his supporters have rallied
he is certain to be a factor In the elec
tion. .If the McGinty support should bo
thrown to either H. Davis of Cleve
land or Worthy Grand President J. F.
Pelletler It would decide the fight.
I The Calif ornlans are not aligning with.
â¢ither the Eastern or Western factions,
and simply announce that they are hero
to win for McGinty. Many of the Califor
nia delegates were instructed for the Cni
cago man. He will also receive strong
support from Congressman Suttlvan's
friends in the New "^ork and -New Eng
land delegations. However, Davis has ear,
cured many delegates and will maka W
strong fightl At this tima he â¢earns to
have the best of the race.
The California delegates will try to cap
ture the next convention for San Fran
cisco. The only formidable rival of thsi
Golden Gate metropolis is Milwaukee.

NEW YORK, Aug. 15.â The tide of de
mand for stocks was reduced to-day, and
while the market fchowed mixed points of
strength they were not so predominant &s for
some time past. The disposition to take
profits evidently had its part in the selling
and the failure of the efforts to get the mar
ket to move upwards prompted an attack in
the latter part of the day by the bears,
which Ehowed come signs of concert and or
ganization. The attack had little success in
dislodging any stock and a rather hearty
movement to cover shorts followed. Some of
the principal selling was much concentrated
in character and was the ground for the
supposition that some of the large operators
who accumulated stocks early In the present
movement were lightening their loads. It was
even surmised that the 6upply of etocks might
be coming from some of the large banking
Interests under a precautionary motive and
with a desire to check speculative excess
with the period approaching for the reduc
tion of banking reserves In New York by the
demand from the interior. The Problem of
this interior demand for currency is the only
present question which seems to weigh at all
apon the market. Attention to it is stimu
lated by yesterday's telegraphic transfer to
Chicago of $500,000. although the approaching
turn in the tide of the currency movement has
bÂ«en manifest for some time past in the
course pursued in the interior in effecting pay
ments cf internal taxes by the- Government
by drafts on their New York correspondent
banks, which is an Indirect transfer of re
quirement upon New York reserves. Reports
from Chicago chow an opinion amongst brok
ers there that money rates are likely soon
to work closer. The great promise of the grain
crops indicates an extraordinary demand for
currency to j effect their movement, and * the
stimulating effect on business -.and industry
in general is reflected in a growing demand
for credits in the West, which promises the
full normal requirement in thfs center. The
Is taken account of also* that yes
terday's conference of prominent Jewish bank
ers with the Russian' .peace envoy may have
the effect ultimately of paring the way for
a participation on the part of the New York
bankers in a future Russian loan. While the
present view of the peace conference is that
a favorable outcome will result, there Is the
reserve caused by the popsibillty of the failure,
which would unquestionably have come de
pressing effect on the etock market. The
weekly crop bulletin of the Weather Bureau
was regarded as giving every encouragement
to the high hopes now entertained for the
great yields at grain centers. The outlook of
the crop was shown to be less favorable. The
beginning of Investigation by the Interstate
Commerce Commission of the charges against
the various railroads and private cac lines,
which are charged with violating the regula
tions for uniform rates, was something of a
weight on the list of railroad 1 stocks which
were most affected by the cressure to sell.
The corn-carrying: railroads were relatively
firm except for the realizing sales in Missouri
Pacific and Atchieon. New York Central was
the most influential railroad stock to make
headway against pressure and speculative
favor turned for the most part to the Indus
trials and specialties again. Of the high
priced stocks Great Northern alone continued
the upward movement sustained \u25a0by professed

j CHICAGO.' Aug. 15.â The wheat market was,
easy at the opening. Elements of strength in
tho situation' were outweighed by, the Govern
ment weekly report-and by a bearlsh-^tone/in'
the market for cash wheat. September start
ed with a loss of %<g Vie and sqjd 4rfwn to
80% c. Sentiment' at this point became about
equally divided, the factors being in excess
of rain in the. Northwest and disinclination of
farmers Southwest to accept current prices.
To start prices upward it only needed the Im
petus of a report that owing to crop failure
the RusÂ«ian Gov*Â»rnrr--nt â¢* , oom>iiV-"Â«r â¢-Â»
strictlon of exports. Under the \u25a0 resulting de
mand from \u25a0 shorts and speculators September
advanced to Sl%c. The l**porj K.vuauou -v ;.ie
American seaboard contributed somewhat to
the better tone, quotations of gcod grades for
shipment abroad being considerably out of lino.
September closed steady, >/i^%c higher at
Biy.c. With the weather all that could be de
sired for the maturing of the corn crop there
was a feeline of bearishness among traders In
that cereal. The close was fairly steady. Sep

arresting them for vagrancy. .
"We ain't no vags," Miss. Doherty
protested, "but actresses out \u25a0 of a' Job.
Me an* this lady do a sister turn, an'
if we happen to be out ot an engage

Miss Laughton also expostulated, but
in vain. "Ye look like actresses, don't
ye?" queried"? the officer, -derisively,
"with your dinky little automobile caps
and your dingy dresses?" ' ,
When the prisoners were released on

fashionable wardrobe. And "they made
good their word by appearing before

pleaded, andp then ! Miss Laughton in-
The transport was docked when Mr.
Johnson twitted Mr. McDermott on his

McDerniott avers that Mr.. Johnson shot
at him without justifiable provocation,
and Mr. Johnson asseverates that .he
did. not shoot until Mr. McDermott. had

Munrphy told the Judge,' and would con

intentions. "If you let me go," he said,

"Then, I suppose, you'll return' to , the

ventured his Honor.
"Ha, ha!" Mr." Murphy chuckled,- pro
pltiatingly. "No, sir; by the time the ap
ples are boxed I'll have recovered my
nerve and be ready to resume work at my
trade."
"Well, I'll give you an; opportunity to

said the court. And as Mr. Murphy ex

nal of encouragement upon Mr. McQuil
lan. .
Following this event will be some beau
tiful gems of music written by W. J. Mc-
Coy, H. J. Stewart and Joseph D. Rod
ding. Each will lead the orchestra dur
ing the rendition of his own composition.
McCoy, who composed the music of
"Hamadryads, a Mask of Apollo," which
was given last year at the Bohemian
Jinks, will give two selections. His first
number will be the beautiful prelude to
"Hamadryads." This will be followed by
another of his exquisite compositions,
the second movement from the suite en
titled "Bohemia" and called "Serenade."
Dr. H. J. Stewart's contribution to the
programme consists of two numbers from
an orchestral suiteâ as yet unfinished
entitled "Scenes in California." Dr. Stew
art has always contended that California
has for the musician as much inspiration
as for the painter or the poet. As he re
cently Bald In a lecture on this topic,
"There are symphonies in the Sierras and
oratorios in the long-drawn aisles of the
redwoods." Following this Idea, the com
poser has designed the "California Suite,"
consisting of four movements. The first,
as yet unfinished. Is entitled "Tosemite."
and the principal themes are the result
of a recent visit to the wonderland of
California. The second movement, a noc
turne, entitled "Under the Redwoods,"
will be played on Friday, and the score
was completed specially for this concert.
The third movement, which at present
exists only in sketch form. Is a barca
rolle entitled "Tahoe." For the conclud
ing number the composer has written a
brilliant Spanish dance leading to a Ta
rantella^ The movement is entitled "Be
fore the Gringo Came," or "La Fiesta,"
and from the enthusiastic reception ac
corded to it on Sunday last at the Bohe
mian Club grove it is safe to predict a
great success for it on Friday next.
The music of "The Guest of the Gor
gon" is said by the 450 members [of the
Bohemian Club who attended the jinks
last Saturday to be of exceptional beauty.
The composer, Theodor Vogt, will lead
the orchestra himself. Besides the or
chestra' of seventy-five pieces there will
be the famous Bohemian Club chorus ot
eighty voices, among whom are numbered
fome of the finest singers on the Pacific
Coast. â¢ :':-r:::<

"Then, I suppose, you'll return' to , the

ventured his Honor.
"Ha, ha!" Mr." Murphy chuckled,- pro

Following this event will be some beau
tiful gems of music written by W. J. Mc-
Coy, H. J. Stewart and Joseph D. Rod
ding. Each will lead the orchestra dur
ing the rendition of his own composition.
McCoy, who composed the music of
"Hamadryads, a Mask of Apollo," which
was given last year at the Bohemian
Jinks, will give two selections. His first
number will be the beautiful prelude to
"Hamadryads." This will be followed by
another of his exquisite compositions,
the second movement from the suite en
titled "Bohemia" and called "Serenade."
Dr. H. J. Stewart's contribution to the
programme consists of two numbers from
an orchestral suiteâ as yet unfinished
entitled "Scenes in California." Dr. Stew
art has always contended that California
has for the musician as much inspiration
as for the painter or the poet. As he re
cently Bald In a lecture on this topic,
"There are symphonies in the Sierras and
oratorios in the long-drawn aisles of the
redwoods." Following this Idea, the com
poser has designed the "California Suite,"
consisting of four movements. The first,
as yet unfinished. Is entitled "Tosemite."
and the principal themes are the result
of a recent visit to the wonderland of
California. The second movement, a noc
turne, entitled "Under the Redwoods,"
will be played on Friday, and the score
was completed specially for this concert.
The third movement, which at present
exists only in sketch form. Is a barca
rolle entitled "Tahoe." For the conclud
ing number the composer has written a
brilliant Spanish dance leading to a Ta
rantella^ The movement is entitled "Be
fore the Gringo Came," or "La Fiesta,"
and from the enthusiastic reception ac
corded to it on Sunday last at the Bohe
mian Club grove it is safe to predict a
great success for it on Friday next.
The music of "The Guest of the Gor
gon" is said by the 450 members [of the
Bohemian Club who attended the jinks
last Saturday to be of exceptional beauty.
The composer, Theodor Vogt, will lead
the orchestra himself. Besides the or
chestra' of seventy-five pieces there will
be the famous Bohemian Club chorus ot
eighty voices, among whom are numbered
fome of the finest singers on the Pacific
Coast. â¢ :':-r:::<
