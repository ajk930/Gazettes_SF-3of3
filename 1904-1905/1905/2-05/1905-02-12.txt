"Thus Homer P. Mellinger made ora
tion to me and Henry Horsecollar In
Sore-toe-kangaroo. And later he di
vested himself of this remark:
" "Boys, I'm to hold a- soiree this

And now her new card case, a gift
on her birthday a few weeks before,
had gone in the usual way, just when
she was expecting the very best of
life, too. Her optimism disappeared
like the sun behind a cloud and with
an aggrieved sense of misplaced trust,
her steps slackened and she came to
a standstill, wondering if it would be
worth while to go back and try to
find it.
"Scarcely," she decided, as the mov
ing crowd of pedestrians slowly filed
past her and with a sigh she resumed
her way northward once more, a lit
tle comforted by the reflection that,
after all, pome honest person would
probably find it and return it to her.
Meanwhile, a tall, athletic young
man, who was swinging up the ave
nue in the same direction, a block or
so behind her, unconsciously rejoicing
in his mere physical vigor and not
philosophizing at all, found his at
tention attracted by a small, dark ob
ject ornamented with a gleaming disk
of silver, that was lying near the edge
of the sidewalk.
Picking it up, he glanced in this
way and. in that, but the handsomely
gowned women who were making
their way in both directions gave no
indication of distress, so he examined
the monogram on the clasp with a
grunt of masculine disdain for such
devices.
Then he bethought him that It
might be a good idea to open it and,
suiting the action to the impulse, he
discovered in one compartment a
latch key and in the other a bunch of
cards.
"Miss Williar,
No. 4 "West th Street,"
he read, taking out one of the cards;
and having thus satisfactorily estab
lished the ownership of his find, he
tucked it Into his pocket and strode
on toward the University Club, idly
wondering if this Miss WJlliar could
be related to the little Cynthia Wil
liar he had known in his boyhood. It
â was this wonder that impelled him to

"We three were sitting at table in the

"I say to myself. 'White man. if I'm
not mistaken, there's been a ba.it laid
wait to see Miss Williar personally,
when, iust before the dinner hour, he
stopped at the address given on the
card.
JHe had notÂ«long to wait. A tall girl
with a look in her eyes that said
plainly that life was an interesting
experience entered the room and he
found himself face to face with what
seemed to him a larger, older and
greatly glorified copy of the small,
freckled girl upon, whom, in moments
of rare generosity, he had sometimes
bestowed his boyish approval.
"Why, Jack Mayhew!" she exclaim
ed with unfeigned gladness, extending
her hand. "Where have you dropped
from?" while his hearty "Jupiter,
Cynthia, if this isn't luck!" uttered
with enthusiastic heartiness while he
conscientiously wrung her hand as if
it had been that of another man,
placed them at once on the plane of
good fellowship where they had part
ed ten years earlier.
In their delight and surprise at the
meeting they talked volubly and some
times both at once, asking about boy
and girl friends and referring hilar
iously to the pranks of those, dear old
days. But if their tongues were busy,
their minds were doubly so
"He's magnificent," Cynthia was
saying over and over to herself with
a thrill of delight, though ostensibly
she was listening with rapt attention
to his account of himself since he left
Elmwood and grown up. While he
filled with admiring wonder at this
new Cynthia, he suddenly lost the
thread of his story and floundered
helplessly, after the manner of persons
who try to think about one thing and
talk about another.
"As I was saying," he Observed im
pressively, making a frantic but in
effectual attempt to recall what he had
been saying. "As I was sayingâ that
is â oh, hang- it all, Cynthia, I was so
busy lookiffg at you that I forgot what
I was saying! Don't know where I'm
at!"
At this plain avowal, they both
out where the tail of your eye could
see it.'
"That night, according to arrange
ments, me and Henry took the phono
graph to a room in a 'dobe house in a
dirty side street, where the grass was
knee high. 'Twas a long room, lit with
smoky oil lamps. There was plenty of
chairs and a table at the back end.
"By and by the invitations to the mu
sicale came sliding in by pairs and
threes and spade flushes. Their color
was of a diversity, running from a
three days' smoked meerschaum to a
patent-leather polish. They were as
polito as wax, being devastated with
enjoyments to give Senor Mellinser the
good evenings. I understood their
Spanish talk â I ran a pumping engine
two years in a Mexican silver mine,
and had it patâ but I never let on.
"Maybe fifty of 'em had come and
was seated, when in slid the kins bee,
the Governor of the district. Mellin
ger met him at the door and escorted
him to the grandstand. When I saw
that Latin man I knew that Mellinger,
private secretary, had all the dances
on his card taken. That was a big,
KquHshy man, the color of a rubber
overshoe, and he had an eye like a
head waiter's.
"Mell'mrer explained, fluent, in the
Castilian idioms, that the soul was
disconcerted with joy at introducing
to his respected friends America's
greatest invention, the wonder of the
age. Henry got the cue and run on
art elegant brass band record and the
festivities became initiated. The Gov
ernor man had a bit of English under
his hat, and when the music was
stopped off he says:
Keith Gordon
laughed and he went on with mascu
line frankness:
"I say, you've done yourself proud.
You're ripping, you know!" and he
gazed at her with so much of the old
boyishness in his face that the reproof
that rose to her lips was suppressed.
Then a black thought suddenly
clutched at her.
"You aren't married, are you?" she
demanded so abruptly and intensely
that she winced the moment the
words were out, while his prompt neg
ative was tempered with a certain
shame as he recalled some events of
the previous year. Cynthia was so di
rect that she inspired him with a desire
to meet her on her own ground.
"No, I'm not married, but I am afraid
that I should have been but for the
firmness of the young lady's mother "'
â¢he acknowledged honestly. "She ha*l
other views for her daughter. You see,
I wasn't rich enoughâ and I'm mighty
glad 1 wasn'tâ now," he added with a
fervor that was beyond suspicion.
Still, Cynthia's manner seemed to
take on a slight coating of ice. "So
you're a blighted being!" she said
thoughtfully, her chin resting on the
back of her hand and her eyes fixed
upon his face speculative] y.
They parted a few minutes later, re
luctantly, it is true, yet with the feel
ing that the fine glow of the meeting
had suddenly faded.
"He's mourning for that horrid little
thing with the mercenary mother." re
flected Cynthia scornfully and without
any compunctions whatever anent the
injustice of calling an unknown damsel
"a horrid little thing." while Jack
Mayhew, his eyes dazzled by the fine,
open face of his old playmate, wonder
ed how he could ever have fancied
pretty little pink-and-white Dorothy.
As he remembered Cynthia's mouth
âwith the little curlycues at the corner
that looked like baby smilesâ his face
grew gloomy.
"Depend upon it. old fellow, you'll
find there is some man in the back
ground," he confided to himself darkly
" *Ver-r-ree fine. Gr-r-r-r-racias,
the American gentleeman, the so
esplendeed moosic as to play.'
"'The table was a long one and
Henry and me sat at the end of it,
next the wall. The Governor sat at
the other end. Homer P. Mellinger
stood at the side of it. I was just
wondering how Mellinger was going to
handle his crowd, when the home
talent suddenly opened the services.
"That Governor man was suitable
for uprisings and policies. I judge he
was a ready kind of man, who took
his own time.
"' "Do the American senora under
stand Spanish?' he asks In his native
accents.
" They do not.' says Melliriger.
" Then listen," goes on the Latin
on the way homeward. "Don't get the
idea that there's any chance for you. A
girl like thatâ" Here he gave up, at
loss for words to express his convic
tions on the subject.
But in spite of this mutual cyni
cism, Mlps Williar aijd Jack Mayhew
were seen together vej y frequently
during the next three month* They
affected palm rooms and art galleries
and such places where a certain soft
splendor and quiet made for sentiment
and low-toned conversation.
It was upon one such occasion that
a patron of art, who haG closed the
Book of Romance before the young
people In this story were born, over
heard the following extraordinary bit
of conversation. He was sitting with
one eye screwed up critically in the
effort to form a judgment of a Claude
Monet on the wall before him, when
he heard the young man murmur anx
iously :
"You don't suppose your mother
will say that I'm not rich enough, do
you?"
"Indeed, no:" replied the girl at his
side confidently. "My mother is not
that kind. Besides, didn't our mothers
know each other before we were born?"
The Datron of art looked slightly
puzaled. From the tail of his cool, esti
mating eye he sent furtive glances at
the pair, vainly endeavoring to follow
the young lady's reasoning.
There was an ecstatic silence for a
second, during which the patron of art
found the two decidedly interesting
from an artistic standpoint. It was an
eloquent momentâ and paintable. It
was really a pity. Then the girl's face
dimpled and she began to speak.
"Oh. Jack.'"' she said, and her tone
was a caress. "Isn't it lucky that I
got you out of the grab-bag after all? "
The patron of art moved away, shak
ing his head as if the times were get
ting beyond him. "Got him out of the
grab-Bag," he murmured, just to see
how it would soundâ "Got him out uf
the grab-bag!"

in this? story.
IT was long after "lights out" in
the dormitory of the Yasoku Mis
sion School on the hill in Yoko
hama and the house had been
quiet for several houiu. Then in
one of the rooms there was the sound
of a paper door sliding gently in its
grooves. And presently, if one had
been quite close to that room, one
might have heard words of which this
is the Enslish:
"August pardon deign, honorable
1 burglar, condescend, please, to appro
priate clothings in lower drawer only;
upper drawer's clothings belong to
honorable other person."
The voice that spoke these words
was low and sweet, quite without ac
cent of fear. Honorable burglar, who
had gone quietly about his business,
paused, though whether it was from
surprise or annoyance or both the ex
pression of his countenance did not
indicate. Certainly he was not ex
pecting: comment so immediate. From
his viewpoint the time for comment
was after he had withdrawn from the
house. He had the diffidence of his
craft and even the smallest audience
embarrassed him.
He could not easily have had Â»
much smaller audience nor a prettier
than the one he had just aroused,
which looked out at j him from be
tween the thick quilts, or futon,

had come to prospect in that very
early morning. Only the square pa
per andon, or night lantern, gave
light in the apartment, but that was
enough to show the sweet oval face.

Miss Godspeed in a gasny way. "What
can you mean, child?"
Spring Blossom told what had hap
pened.
"But why did you not cry out to â â 
to â warn us?" asked the teacher. It
was six hours after the event, but she
felt fear coming upon her.
"Honorable burglar took only my
unworthy things and he did not make
noise."
" Butâ but " â Miss Godspeed could
not think of anything to say.
Later, however, she went through the
dormitories with a policeman by her
side and found everything in place ex
cept Sprang Blossom's silken robes.
Spring Blossoms was the nearest room
to the top of the stairway, the first
<ne, probably, that honorable burglar
had entered. The talk he had had with
his sm#.ll audience had delayed him too
long for visiting the other rooms, per
haps, or perhaps he lost his nerve;
most probably though, the policeman
said, honorable burglar could not
free himself from the idea 1 that having
been seen, there would be a warning of
some sort.
There was a warning, but not from
Spring Blossom. She declared she re
membered nothing distinctive about
honorable burglars appearance, as
there was but little light in the room.
But he had not quite escaped other
observation on leaving the premises
and the next day. at the shop of a deal
er in second-hand clothes who was not
notoriously particular, honorable burg
lar fell into the grasp of the law.
As Spring Blossom's kimono was with
him, the police knew they had the right
man. To prison he went.
Spring Blossom went to the prison,
too, some time after, having persuaded
Miss Godspeed, rather to that worthy
person's astonishment, that one ought
to visit prisons if one really believes.
Such a thing had not occurred to the
shepherdess of the mission's flock be
fore, but at length she said "Yes," and
with the young believer who waj
teaching her what belief was she vis
ited honorable burglar In his coop.
When honorable burglar saw Spring
Blossom as much surprise as a Jap
anese face can show was manifest, but
there was no sign of ill will about him
even when he received a quantity of
good advice and the gift of one of the
mission's publications for his enlighten
ment.
When she came away from the prison
Spring Blossom was quite happy at
the chance she had had of doing the
right thing.
"If kimono had lost for ever I should
be glad same as now," she said. "Hon
orable teacher will augustly conde
scend to see honorable burglar with
me several times?" Once more Miss
Godspeed assented and the days for
visiting were full of Joy for the small
daughter of Japan.
Spring Blossom had been at the mis
sion school two years and thought it
a sort of Paradise. How near she had
come to being in another of Yoko
hama's recognized institutions for a
equal length of time when she would
have led a life as evil as her present
life was good she had no suspicion.
But she had been as near as near can
be and not. It was the Rev. Mr. Chol
mondeley to whom she was Indebted for
the happy fact that she was on the
Yama, as Yokohamites call the Hill,
instead of in Kuban down belojv, a
place much worse than sheol. Chol
mondeley declared himself, however,
that It was not he but Providence. He
was merely the humble instrument.
Spring Blossom's father, Ototsusan,
was a farmer. He lived in Suruga. He
was not an actual worker in the fields,
a most miserable occupation in Japan,
but was the owner of same dozens of
those irregular quadrilaterals of mud
that are separated, one from another,
by low ridges instead of by fences, and
are cultivated by hand. They are slop
py with filth eight months out of the
twelve, and dry only at harvest when
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
they look like a checkerboard an earth
quake has been playing with.
As an owner Ototsusan had prosper
ed until a few years before when heavy
rains had washed away the banks and
dams, and the water had carried off
the sprouting rice. These floods had
dene sad work. But worse than this
had happened; vouchers for certain
moneys he had loaned before the
Restoration, and other papers which
concerned Government and the honor
of his house had disappeared. They
could not be of use to other folk, but
should the Government call upon him
to state his position as to certain oc
currences during the time of the Go
Ishin, the revolution, which made the
Restoration possible, the absence of
these papers signed by the thumbmarks
of their writers would be awkward.
Ototsusan Indeed would lose his "face"
if not his headâ and to lose his face
while those worthy persons, his hon
ored parents, were yet alive, that would
be the ultimate anguish the Japanese
mind can sufferâ harakiri would be joy
compared to it. Had he not lost hia
vouchers he might have raised money
from the Government and done some
thing toward the recovery of the pa
pers, but as it was he went to the
money lenders.
It was in these evil days that an
agent came from Yokohama, Suruga
was on his route. Twice a year ha
passed through somewhat as a recruit
ing sergeant might. He would have
been invaluable to the census bureau
were that work not done perfectly by
the Department of Police, for he knew
every household in the, province. Es
pecially had he an eye for homes
where means were small and daughters
beautiful.
"Suruga augustly enjoys honorable
improvement," said this agent to a
brother agent who had come down
with him from Kuban and was bound
for Nagoya in the interests of the
house for which both worked. ' \
"Honorable floods have been exten
sive, poverty augustly prevails; honor
able business probably will augustly
improve." Then he put a pinch of the
mildest of tobacco Into his tiny pipe
bowl, consumed it in three puffs,
knocked the ash into the bamboo tube
by the firebox and lost himself in com
placent contemplation of probable net
profits.
Of course the agent went to Ototsu
san, for he knew that the conditions
there were of the sort his business
profited by. Spring Blossom had been
on his list for several years. He dis
cussed the floods with the farmer, the
lack of crops and the wickedness of
money lenders, and came round grad
ually to the august parents, the deities
of Ototsusan's home, for whose wel
fare filial piety demanded every sacri
fice.
Proud must be the man with a
father and a mother of such nobility.
was the tenor of the agent's words, and
Ototsusan assented. What a joy,
what an honor to keep them in com
fort while they lived. And*again Otot
susan assented. What was a daugh
ter that a father should consider her
when his parents' comfort was at
stake? continued the apent, and more
to the same effect.
It seemed that there would be a bar
gain and Spring Blossom would go to
Yokohama for two or three years of
service under conditions nominated in
a form the office of police supplies, a
form which Ototsusan, Spring Blos
som, Kuban's master and the inspec
tor of police would sign. One more
day and Ototsusan would decide.
That evening, however, the head of
the Yama Mission School appeared at
Spring Blossom's home by chance.
Ototsusan thought, but the man from
the Yama said chance had naught to
do with it. He knew the hand of
Providence, he declared, wherever it
vouchsafed to manifest itself. He knew
the Kuban agent, too, by reputation,
and of Kuban he had a detestation he
had never dared to express in words.
He knew the "august parents" and
the peril of the honor of the house,
and though he had but little money
compared to what the agent could ad
vance, he had the faith that over
cometh and he won.
And so it happened, thanks to the
promises he made with go bold a heart,
that Spring Blossom journeyed to
Yokohama later by the same route she
would have taken had she traveled
with the agentâ all but the. final turn
ing to the right instead of to the left.
Ther,s she profited greatly and in two
years was nearly ready for her Govern
ment certificate admitting her as
teacher to one of the imperial schools.
Her examinations at the m^sion as
sured of her success, but the prospect
of so honorable employment did not
occupy her mind to the exclusion of
honorable burglar in durance vile.
With Miss Godspeed she saw him regu
larly, and if she did not work that
somewhat uncertain miracle called
conversion, she did him good. He is
not a burglar now.
When the day of his release came.
Spring Blossom and the teacher met
him at the entrance and took him to
a buildiiyr on the mission grounds
where often guests are entertained
There they served a dinner in native
style. Honorable burglar, who was no
fool, learned much about Spring Blos
som's affairs that afternoon.
At sur.ilown, with the courtesy of a
knight of the feudal days, a Samurai.
to use the native term, he withdrew,
taking with him various presents from
Spring Blossom and an assortment of
tracts from Miss Godspeed. They did
net see him for several weeks, but
Spring Blossom did not forget him.
Each night she asked that he might
b<j "delivered from temptation** and
never steal any more, "for ever and
ever, amen." Nor for & moment did
she doubt that all would be well.
It was a month, perhaps, after the
honorable burglar's release that he
appeared at the school one day and
asked to see his friends. He was In
the tea business and prospering. He
had found an opportunity, he ex
plained, that suited him. exactly and
already had some honest money in the
Specie Bank. The future was his for
success and if Miss Godspeed would
condescend to grant a rude request he
would beg her to receive two sisters
from his unworthy home Into her
school. Miss Godspeed condescended
with alacrity and then and there the
honorable burglar, or ex-burglar, paid
their fees for a full year in advance.
<>n leaving, with many bows quite
t>-> the floor, and apologies for his pre
sumption, he begged Spring Blossom to
augustly deign to accept an unworthy
tin of contemptible tea. In reality it
wa3 tea of the finest quality that the
empire produced.
That evening Spring Blossom opened
the tin to transfer the tea to a pretty
canister, one of several prizes she
had won by her work in school. Half
only of the tin held tea. The lower
half contained a package wrapped in
a silken handkerchiefâ a package of
papers, those which Ototsusan had lost,
and which, now that they had been re
covered, would "save his face."
After teaching school three years
Spring Blossom became mistress of a
house overlooking one of the most
charming of the many charming views
round about Yokohama. It was com
plete in its appointments and had sev
eral rooms furnished after the Euro
pean style, wherein one might often
see Miss Godspeed discussing a biscuit
and a cup of tea, such tea as we know
little of in this country. And it is a
fact that the income of the household
in this house came entirely from tea.On Monday and . Wednesday

women, who this year seem to have

the gatherings in Covent Garden, Lon- .
don, or the Grand Opera-house In
Paris. ! " i
Many of the Jewels which grace the
Metropolitan each Monday and
WednesOay night have become his
toric In social circles not only la New
York but the country over. Women
from Washington, Philadelphia, Bos
ton, Chicago. Denver and San Fran
cisco, who are entertained by New
Yorkers during the opera season, add
their jeweled magnificence to an al
ready dazzling array.
Some of these jewels seldom see the
light save on opera nights and es
pecially do their owners endeavor to
gird themselves in their gleaming
glory when the opera bill precedes a
large private ball, or when special
honor is to be done some famous
singer. Vet there is some sham even
among these birds of paradise in the
famous parterre circle. Women some
times become panic stricken and have
counterfeit gems set to duplicate their
famous pieces of real Jewelry, but
these women are few, as the danger
of robbery in the opera-house* is really
remote. Just before the opera season
opens the safety deposit vaults yield
up their treasures, some of which have
bten in families for half a century.
During the past ten years lavishness
in perns has increased with the new
standard of luxury and. whereas a
diamond necklace, in the past, was
the last cry of magnificence, the mod
ern woman must cover her shoulders
with a riviere of diamonds costing
five times a* much as the nÂ«Â£klace of
former days. No longer does the mere
tiara indicate unbounded wealth and
instead the opera goer may see all
round crown* of diamonds, though
these crowns are not precisely com
mon. Brooches are now replaced with
a new device, known in the vernacu
lar of diamond importers as a plas
tron. This is an exaggerated mass of
diamonds built to cover . the entire
bosom, or. at any rate, to make a
brave display. Kings are not used as
generally as in former days, but ear
rings, especially pearls, are seen in
many ears.
There teems to be no question about
the fact that Mr*!. Astor, the vener

the costliest gems in America and it

awful.
A woman or^ man too proud to beg,
too honeat to steal, tramps day after
day seeking work, and being neatly
and cleanly garbed, fails to excite the
substantial sympathy that would prove
a benefit. They cannot indulge the
whine that ip your true mendicant's
stock in trade and are perhaps turned
away and positions awarded those
most shabby in appearance, but not
one-half #o deserving or in such abso
lute need. You cannot judge and the
beggar who doles out a pitiful yarn is
more likely to have his rags fairly
wadded with bank bills than is the
neat, but proud, man or woman to
have enjoyed the luxury of a half sat
isfying dinner.
The unworthy candidates for bounty
are the wretched mainsprings that
close the avenues of sympathy and aid
from those most worthy. People are
deceived so often that a hardening pro
cess gradually closes about the hearts
and well meaning of those whose
purses can afford the luxury of gen
erosity.
To help those less fortunate than
themselves should be the coveted pleaÃ
ure of those favored of fortune. There
is no happiness to equal that enjoyed
through making others happy, The
sunlight we cast into other lives con
centrates its rays, reflecting back in
brighter, purer force.
We cannot sift out or investigate

for granted that truth has been toid us

In many of the most fashionable cafes
of New York no wages are paid, the
waiters depending solely upon the gen
erosity of the patrons. It is not right:
it is not just; but to watch the faces of
the poor devils as a patron comes in,
to note the disappointment when they
move by to another table more desir
ably located, to watch the expression as
they note this, is to a thinking person
abundant incentive to that kindness
which is the one spark of the divine

Probably the largest singll diamond
in America is owned by Mrs. Elbridge
T. Gerry, who has worn this yellowisn
stone for thirty years. It is set in an
old-fashioned brooch surrounded^ by
diamonds, and the surface of the" Gerry
treasure ecuals that of a sliver dollar.
Mrs. Gerry usually wears solitaire ear
rings, diamonds of tremendous size and
marvelous brilliancy. She has also a
diamond necklace of great Ueauty and
brooches in profusion.
There is no woman, barring Mrs.
Astor, Who has aa many jewels at her
command as Mrs. Osden Mills. On the"
night of the last William C. Whitney
ball this social leader appeared at the
opera-house in an apple-green velvet
gown. Above her hep rose a towering
crown of diamonds and pearls that was
compared quite commonly to a picket
fence. Her riviere of diamonds extend
ed from the base of her throat to her
shoulder tips, a cape of diamonds
rather than a mere necklace, and her
bodice was covered by a network of
the sparkling gems. Mrs. Mills Is a
small, slight woman, and unckr this
wealth of diamonds she seemed lost.
Mrs. Mills' most intimate friends, Mrs.
Edmund L. Baylies, born a Van Rena
selaer, has a crown of diamonds the
genuineness of which many have dared
to question. This is a tall, impressive
affair, worthy of royalty, and Mrs.
Baylies, a magnificently tall woman,
wears her crown like a queen.
Mrs. Perry Belinont displays at the
opera her emeralds which created
such a sensation two years ago in
London. These magnificent green
stones are worn in a row across her
bodice and are wonderfully effective
against white, Mrs. Belmont's favor
ite color. Her sister-in-law, Mrs. Ol
iver I}. P. Belmont. has pearls and
diamonds in conventional forms, relics
of the days when she was Mrs. Wil
liam K. Vanderbilt.
Mrs. Robert Goelet. a bride of six
months, received from her husband a
riviere of emeralds and diamonds des
tined to become a famous ornament
on opera nights. The eight emeralds
are each the size of quarters and are
set in a maze of diamonds.
The fame of Mrs. John R. Drefel
rests largely on her incomparabl*
jewels and she has tvo parures â the
jeweler's term for a complete set of

with a feeling of hurt pride that makes

Two magnificent collections of gems
were lost to the Metropolitan Opera
house audiences when Mrs. John ,W.
Mackay and . Mrs. Bradley Martin
.went to London. Mrs. Martin owned
a set of pearls supposed to have been
worn by Marie Antoinette, and Mrs.
Martin's diamonds were Insured for
$200,000. Mrs. Mackay's favorite gems
are sapphires and. she has a necklace
of sapphires . and diamonds and five,
brooches, which' she used to wear
against a sown of white brocade ten
years ago. Last winter she displayed
a few of these gems at the opera when

gems are not necessarily the most

MAKING H JiUE.U
It can thus be seen at a casual glance
that the problem with which we are
confronted, especially about this time
of th e year, is no simple one. How can a
man drink and not drink simultaneous
ly, contemporaneously and concurrent
ly. We shall not venture to propose an
answer, principally because we do not
believe there is any. At least we have
never found one in any of our careful
scientific experiments and observations.
However, in order to show how it can
not be done, and therefore to hold up a
beacon light to the young men of
America and Jersey City, we shall com
ment very briefly on some of the sa
lient facts in the career of Mr. William
O. Fizz, late of Manhattanâ both city
and cocktail.
Mr. Fizz was reputed by those who
claimed to be in a position to know to
be the original discoverer of the booze
bug. The world-shaking discovery was
made late one night on a certain
brightly lighted street which runs from
dere is tousanda of good folks who
wouldn't never have a chance to make
a front. Dafs right. Suppose a mug
has made a tom in Wall street what
puts him a million to de good of de
game â only a million â is de papers
filled wit fairy stories about him, so
dat his old school fellows back in de
long grass country will know dat he
has landed? Xot a bit like it. wit only
a. million to de good. It takes a real
killing â ten or twenty million at de
smallest â to give a man a good notice
in de Wall street part of de papers.
So what is a poor man to do who has
cashed in for only a million or ko?
It isn't wort speaking about in New
York, but back in Beetville it will
make a sensation, and dat is what's
wanted. What's going to get him de
papes? De Horse Show. Sure!
It only costs a tousand or so for a box
at de show for de season, and de ex
penses after de ghow. suppers and de
likes of dose, and dat will buy as much
advertising for de mug's wife's gowns
as a dozen million strike in Wall street
would done.
De horses don't need it; dere isn't any
qu.g:ion about deir being well bred and
well trained and well mannered and
well groomed before de Horse Show
opens, or wedder it opehs or not. But
wit human mugs it's different. Who is
to know dat a human mug is all right,
ie one of de real things, if he doesn't
have a chance to prove it at de Horse
Show? Say. it gives me a pain in me
temper to hear folks saying dat dere is
no reason for de Horse Show!
Besides de mug dat has raked off a
million in de las test bulge in debentures
preferred and who wants it known

On and Off the Bread Wagon
Being Hard Luck Tales and Doings of an Amateur Hobo
chances I toted water sva? step of the
way.
Generally, though. I, managed to
reach a spring, water hole- or. stream
3tter an all-night tramp, and there
rested comfortably, in the shade of the
willows. If the stream appeared to
have the goods I hung my pack on a
willow tree, got out my trusty fish line,
captured a grasshopper and added fried
trout to my regular fare of bread and
bacon. Fresh bread daily, without the
aid of an oven, is the main standby of
the overland hobo. Here is the way
we make and bake it: "
My only utensil was the frying pan.
In that I mixed a dough of self-rising
flour and water. The loaf was shaped
like a large doughnut, the hole in the
middle being: left to obviate that sad
and soggy feeling noticeable sometimes
in open-air bread. I baked my loaf in
the frying pan, over the fire, until the
bottom was cooked; then I propped the
pan on edge alongside the blaze and
allowed the reflected heat to bake the
top. Better results, hobo cooks aver,
are obtained in this manner than by
turning the loaf upside down in the
pan. The weight flattens the uncooked
surface and spoils the artistic effect.
Having no broom straws with which
to tell when the bread was done. I
tested the loaf with my teeth, and was
doubly thankful, sometimes, I had such
good, strong teeth. A little gravy, like
mother used to make, is very nice on
this bread.
For more than a week the only hu
man form I saw was my own image
in the pools from which I dipped up
vater. Being in no hurry, I spent a
profitable lot of time fishing, and
wasted some more wishing for a gun
with which to slay jackrabbits. Every
clump of sage brush sheltered a family
of long-eared jacks, and large colonies
of unsettled rabbits hopped across the
nail in the soft moonlight.
One night I found a mule whip lying
in the dust, and as I stooped over to
pick it up the whip coiled and sprung
its rattle. My footwork in the sidestep
getaway was so rapid the sudden start
broke the strap that bound me to my
pack and I left it in the road. The
isttler held his position and sent out
repeated warnings that he was not to
be monkeyed with, but I bombarded
him with sand and bush tops until he
moved away and allowed me to recover
the pack. After that, had I come
across a mule whip, gold-handled and
studded with diamonds, blazing in the
light of a deceitful moon, I would have
smothered the temptation to pick it up.
Besides, I was making fairly good time
without a whip.
A little after daylight one morning 1
was pitching my camp beside a purling
streamlet when a beauteous sound
smote the air. It was a robust human
snore that started with a gurgle and
one end to the other of a certain great
city. Now the middle portion of this
brightly lighted street is lined â  with
many resorts whose inmates are known
to suffer from the frequent attacks of
an obscure virus or bacteria whose
identity was little understood previous
to the advent of Fizz. The effects are
extreme giddiness, great capacities of
conversation, especially on insignificant
subjects, and a general disposition to
claim the earth for the exclusive prop
erty and habitation of the one afflicted.
The after effects are marked by a
great increase in the size of hat neces
sary for comfort, a peculiar affinity
for the ice water pitcher and a ten
dency to swear by all known standards
that the same thing will not happen
again. It never does; there are al
ways a sufficient number of variations
in the booze bug affliction to justify
the victim's claim that he has kept his
oath.

bushes, so close to the stream his fev
ered feet were soaking In the water, lay
a man rolled in blankets. When I spoke
to him, he leaped up, pistol in hand, but
seeing nothing but a frazzled kid, the
stranger calmed down. He was heading
for the effete East and didn't care how
soon he got there, h said. Bellview. a
mining camp on the Wood River, was
one day's stroll to the westward and if
that was my destination I had best be
going, the man intimated. Seeing he
didn't care f</r my choice company I cut
out sleep for that day and hustled on to
Bellview.
I reached Wood River at dusk and
was crossing a bridge built of l6gs,
leading to the town, when a familiar
yet puzzling sound broke out at the
other end of the bridge. There seemed
to be some one whistling an operatic
air to a Chinese orchestra accompani
ment. Then a form came twitching
and jerking along in the gloaming. My
mentorâ my guide, the tramp with St.
Yitus' dance and the long stemmed
frying pan, loomed up. It was the
hanging of his pan against the bridge
rail that heralded the approach of an
old friend.
"Hello, sonny." he said between jerks.
"Where are you going?"
"Into the town," I replied. "Any
thing doing?"
"Well, I should say. Too hot ther~
for me. This is Fourth of July and
you're just in time to see ths fireworks
go off. Hear 'em shooting up the town?
Wish you luck. "
Having Jerked out this bulletin, the
tramp moved away in the darkness,
still whistling and beating haphazard
time with the frying pan.
Meanwhile our country's natal day
was being: biown off to beat the band.
It sounded like the published reports of
the siege of Port Arthur, with the wails
of the maimed and dying tossed in on
the sick\ The mining < amp had but
one street, a (.-rooked thoroughfare fol
lowing the bend of the river. Great
â¢ bonfires blazed in the middle of the
RtlACSef and the grand illuminating effect
was heightened by lanterns made of
red paper or a framework of sticks
hung on the shanties. In lieu of fire
works, the patriotic inhabitants let off
guns and pistols loaded with balls, and
the popping was truly exhilarating.
The main celebration raged in a big
saloon and dance hall. Three or four
rickety females took turns waltzing
with half a hundred frenzied patriots.
who employed each other as dancing
partners until the ladies were at liber
ty. This terrific outburst of social
granaeur and gaiety after my lonesome
spell in the desert all but stunned me.
Wishing to be patriotic and at the
same time devilish, I left my pack out
side the dance hall and treated myself
to one glass of beer, which cost 15
cents. This. I believe, is about the
cheapest Fourth of July I ever put in.
The soothing waltz strains for tfcat
spirited revelry were produced by an
aged blind negro, who sawed away in
the corner on a fiddle with one string.
Whenever the- more reckless dancers
piled up near him the blind negro
turned in terror and hovered his fiddle

the lane, which, by the way, was and
is yclept Broadway because at certain
times of the night it is so narrow and
crooked, was caused by a germ came
to our friend Fizz's mind one morn
ing. It was a Morning after a previous
Night, with capital letters. Feeling
within himself many of the symptoms
which we have described above, he be
gan forthwith to search for some sci
entiflc explanation. In these days every
thing from laziness to barratry and
bankruptcy is caused by a germ, and
nothing was more natural than , that
Mr. Fizz should ascribe his lost, ruined
and generally undone condition to the
ravages of a defenseless germ. Germs
have very few friends any way and
there is no apparent reason why they
should not be charged with alt the ills
to which human flesh is heir, especially
those for which the victim desires to
shirk the responsibility.
Having found the germ, Mr. Fizz set
about the discovery of an anti-toxin
that should be able to put the afore
said germ out of business. The obvious
relief was in homeopathy. Similia
real style is to be dls winter."
W>s I ready! Say, I had on me pat
skates, me swallow tail, a westcoat dat
would put your eye out in de sunshine,
and a opray hat dat crushed as flat as
a pancake, and a top coat dat dragged
two feet along de ground. Ready! Well!
De rubber-neckers was blocking de
walk in front of de box when we gets
to de garden, for Mr. Paul's and
Whiskers 1 names was on de checker
boards dey was studying, and our
folks being de realest tings in swells in
little old N.ew York, all de rubbers was
croisy to pipe 'em off.
"Mon dieu!" says Duchess, as de
usher ushers us into de box. "is dere
lie- way to keep de common people
from annojing us like dis?" she says.
"Hush your mout, woman," I whis
pers to her, "or one of de 'common
people' will shy a stick at me dicer,
and den I'll have' a fight on me hands
dat will be wort more dan de rest of
de shc-w."
But Duchess was having de time of
her life, and dere was no stopping her.
She had one of dese long handled eye
glasses, and she looked over de crowd
like it made her feel a little seasick
to be so close to 'em. Den she shifts
her glasses around to de folks in de
boxes near us and gives 'em a glad
smile like she was saying, "Well, we
must be stared at, we who are de
Real Tings, but we can keep each od
der company in our misery and get
what fun dere Is out of de game."
Dats de kind of look dat alway3
lands some come-on who is looking
for a chance to butt in and be seen
talking to de great folks. It landed
all right, all right. .
A four-tlush Wall street Johnnie
sat in de next box. and de style of
Duchess near paralyzed him. I seen
him look at de checker-board to see
who we was and when he read Mr.
Paul's and Whiskers' names he tells
'em to de odders in his box and dey
smiles like de bull pup when he dees
de cat and de cat doesn't see him.
On de level, dere was some Real
keerful!" he wailed. "Dey haint no

From which it will be seen the com
mittee on music for that Fourth of July
celebration was up against the real
thing. The wool and whiskers of the
sightless negro were white with age.
and bodily infirmities had bent him al
most double. How he got to that out
landish place and what was his regular
business I do not know, for I then had
troubles of my own and didn't bother
much with the affairs of other people.
That night, regardless of the rattle of
musketry, I llept sweetly in a sort of
barn. In the morning I removed from
a new set of harness a number of nice
straps, needed to replace the ones on
my pack broken in the encounter with
the rattlesnake, and once more sought
the dusty trail to the Pacific Coast.
Near the log bridge was a small boy
boiling coffee at a campfire. Close by
in the woods stood a battered state
coach, with four skinny white horses
tethered to the wheels. eating their
breakfast. The boy said his pa. who
was still celebrating in the i'iwn. owned
the rig. They had some from Boise
City, 160 miles away, with a stageload
of fresh vegetables. Pa had cleaned uu
a nice wad of money selling cabbages
to the miners, and would start for
Boise that day. Pretty soon papa
stopped shooting up the camp a/id came
down to the bridge for breakfast. I
boned the old man for a ride to Boise,
and he looked with favor on the propo
sition. He was very! sleepy, expected
to be more or less drowsy on the home
ward trip of four days and would take
me along, provided I could drive a
four-in-hand. Of course I could, and
the battered coach tooled across the losr
bridge with me on the box.
The vegetable man curled up in the
bottom of the roach and snored. There
was nothing for me lo do but to hold
the reins, as the horses had too much
sense to leave the trail. Sometimes the
boy crawled inside and I had the entire
Northwest to myself. Toward evening
we encamped at a water hole just va
cated by the St. Vitus' dance^ man, set
ting out on his night tramp. Still, I felt
confident of beating him to Boise City,
it he contemplated a visit to that place.
Those were four grand days, tooling
the four-in-hand, and I gaze back with
pride on my career as a stage driver.
But one untoward incident marred*
this trip, and I was not to blame. Be
sides his bottled goods, the old man had
bought a pair of high-heeled calfskin
boots, for which he paid $15. In his
waking moments the boots were his
theme and glory. The second night out
he was so far recovered as to sleep on
the ground, using the new boots for a
pillow. Field mice, or some other
equally ravenous rodent, banqueted on
the $15 boots, eating the feet off at th<;
oily creases at the ankles. The rage
and srrief of the old man were awful to
behold, and his frothings gave me a
fine on the folly of pinning one's faith
to earthly treasures. For the next two
days the indlgn&nt and highly incensed
old gentleman cursed every living
thing, including birdjs of the air and
monsters of the deep.
At Boise I worked two weeks in a
horse corral and made a grub stake of
NICHOLAS NEMO
similibus curantur, which is, being in
terpreted, the hair of the dog is good
for the bite. To put his theory into
language that shall be comprehensible
to the layman, Mr. Fizz came to the
conclusion after at leaSt fifteen min
utes' study that the only way to kill
the booze bug was by drowning it in
the medium in which it was discov
ered. It was as though one should at
tempt to kill all the fish in the sea by
spraying the surface of the ocean with
a garden hose, but the inconsistency of
his position did not seem to worry Mr.
Fizz. Perhaps it appealed to him.
Having settled the matter to his awn
satisfaction, Mr. Fizz at once set out
to put his cure into effect. To the ordi
nary observer it was a very difficult
feat to distinguish between the malady
and the cure, but Mr. Fizz was certain
that he could see a difference. At any
rate there was a great difference in the
ideals^ of the two courses of conduct
and that should be the determining fac
tor. Furthermore, the added ease of
conscience with which he sallied forth
night after night was enough to repay
him amply for all the mental anguish
Ting mugs and mugesses in some of
de boxes, but none of 'em looked so
like ready money as Duchess. Her
chin and eyebrows was up like she
was saying what an awful time de
'ristocrats did have mixing wit de
commons, her shoulders was humped
like she was saying she would do her
duty and be seen by de rubbers in de
walk If she died for it and her eye
was out for a glad smile to de un
known million-winners who might
like to mix wit her for de good of de
cause â and our benefit.

he pretty soon leans over to me and
he says. "How did Debenture Pre
ferred close on de tape?"
'"Steen and naith," I says, just for
luck.
'"Steen and naith!" he says, smiling
big. "My word, dat is good for me.

forgot to order a sell, and at dat price
I'm ten more tousand to de good on

walked home instead of taking de tun

wagons hitched en train, four mules,
one wife, three little children and a
whole arsenal of ritles. shotguns and
pistols. This terror of the plains was
headed for the Blue Mountains of Ore
gon to make a fortune chopping wood.
If I cared to join the expedition he
would haul my pack and let me walk
beside or behind the wagons. That
sounded like a good offer, and I jumped
at it.
We led*a royal gypsy life far weeks.

firially at a satisfactory .sefentific con
clusion, s'
The years sped byT accompanied al
ways by William G. Fizz, whose course
was fully as Â»apid as that of the years.
At times he was tormented by doubts
as to the wisdom of the course which
he had marked out for himself. Booze
bugs appeared to be very tenacious of
life and the amount of liquid that was
necessary to drown even one small bug
was beyond belief. What would be re
quired to put the quietus on a large
colony of adult bugs in the full enjoy
ment of robust health and high spirits
would be impossible to compute.
The only consolation that appeared to
remain for Fizz was in the thought
that if he was growing old. so were the
bugs. It thus resolved itself into a test
of endurance. Would the bugs give out
first or would they dance in ghoulish
glee around the coffin of the late Wil
liam G. Fizz? Again and again he
made appointments with himself for
suspending the treatment, which had
now become heroic, i.nd allowing the
bugs to starve or move. But he was

up deir minds dat she was talking de

and I done it. too. Just to play de game
under one rule for all.
I seen what Duchess was playing
for and I wishes her luck, for I'd felt
in me jeans and found dat I couldn't
dig up de nrice of Frankforters and
beer, and I was carrying a tidy totat
and appetite at dat. But Duchess
landed 'em all right. Debenture Pre

listening for. He wanted to know what

de way we didn't keep him waiting

wanted him to say de next ting. But
he never tumbled. He says if we had
no engagement would we join his
gang in a bottle and a boid at de place
we'd touted as de best in town and
we said "Sure." And we done it. No
need to tell you what kind of a feed
we had when Duchess consented to
oblige and order for de party.
Little old Debenture Preferred
couldn't have de bottles opened fast
enough, and we was having de mer
riest party in de restaurant when I

those dear little germs who had been
regular tenants of his earthly frame lo
these many years being thrust out into
the cold world in their helpless old age
was too much for him. Never should
it be said of him that he deceived a

v thing of their pictur
esque â tatetteeaÃ, though they no*
abound with hetmi of plass of every
form and for every purpose.
The dwellers in these homes have,
Mac a peculiar charac
ter. They have an idiosyncrasy. They
are chiefly rick merchants, directors of
the Bank of England, men whose fath-
*rs were directors of the East India
:-any or chairmen of the great
docks that were built in the port of
LfOndon during the great war. The
new dam of railway magnates are
rarely to be found here. Their .for
tunes: have been made in modern times,
and by mean* which allow them to live
much farther from the city and yet
find themselves as early every morning
at their boards and counting houses as
the old families at Clapham, who, after
all, are only four miles from CornhJll.
Bet the very fact that, comparatively
â peafctag; they are old families, and
â¢<â  is r," inglorious tradition
.". m of philanthropy and piety,
of good and great works, and of some
â¢c even illustrious, binds
them to the sacred soil by that local
spell â¢which is one of the most power
ful influences over mankind.
Mr. Falconet was the head of one of
the most considerable of these families.
His father, an East Indian director,
had beer, an Intimate friend and com
panion cf Mr. Wilberforce, who lived
Ir his immediate neighborhood and who
vas the godfather of his son. _He had
supported Mr. Wilberforce in all his
great enterprises, with his purse as well
as his personal energy. His son, Wil
berforce Falconet, had married, accord
ing to the Clapham custom, at an early
age a young lady who lived at Laven
der Hill and whose father was another
friend of Mr. Wilberforce. Even in the
enthusiastic world in which she was
horn the bride was remarkable for the
exaltation of her ideas. She was the
founder of many institution! and the
soul of all. Schools and hymns and
Bible classes and tract distributions
and industrial homes engrossed her life.
But she was pretty, and Wilberforce
Falconet lost his heart to her. He him
self quite sympathized with all her pur
suits and purposes and had, indeed,
been born and bred in a similar re
ligious and moral atmosphere to her
own. This, however, did not prevent
him from having the reputation of be
ing a first-rate man of business. In
deed, he was sometimes thought to be
a little too sharp In his transactions, in
which a fuller and larger degree of
Christian forbearance, some intimated,
might be desh-able. As it was, at the
head of one of the most considerable
East India houses he succeeded on the
death of his father to a large realised
fortune, and was so wealthy that he
need not have been appalled by the
large family of both sexes which the
pretty and enthusiastic partner of hiÃ
life had presented to him.
It was not the Â£30,000 with which he
endowed each of his daughters when
they married that was the sole or even
principal cause of their soon quitting
the paternal roof. It was really the cus
tom of the county, and as they were
all pretty, like their mother, and full of
enthusiasm they quickly captivated
young gentlemen of the neighborhood,
who were generally about the same age
and yielded to the blended spell of re
ligious devotion, female charms and
the most comfortable and piously luxu
rious domestic establishment in the
whole neighborhood.
The eons, though stalwart youths,
had not inherited the fair mien of their
mother. They resembled, and strongly,
their other parent, who it was the cus
tom to aver was descended frc-m a Hu
guenot family. In truth, his father was
the son of a. Genevese watchmaker, and
he had himself been a clerk to an emi
nent English firm, whese his talents
and knowledge of foreign tongues were
appreciated. The revocation of the
Edict of Nantes with the rich middle
class of the country occupies the same
position as the conquest of England by
the Nonr.ans does with our patricians.
It throws a halo of imagination over
many a humble or obscure origin.
The countenance of Wilberforce Fal
conet was austere, and its expression
would have been saturnine had it not
been in a. state of constant mitigation
from his thrilling sense of domestic
happiness, worldly prosperity, and re
ligious satisfaction. In the manage
ment of his family Wilberforce Fal
conet was a despot, but he was an af
fectionate one. He often reaulred
uacrifiees. but h? occasionally made
them, and in either case he was satis
fied he was acting in a manner becom
ing the patriarchs.
His two elder sons were in his count
ing house, and were soon to be his
partners, when they both were engaged
to marry young ladies who were.\the
, bosom friends of their sisters and were
of the same committees and
distributors of the same tracts. An
other son was a sailor. Permission to
enter the naval profession had^ been
long contested, but with the prospect
that his services would be confined to
the South African squadron- had at
length been obtained. Another son,
who seemed inclined to be a sailor,
was turned by the panic-stricken fam
ily into a clergyman without delay, and
there only remained the youngest son
for whom a career was to be provided.
Joseph Toplady Falconet had been a
child of singular precocity. His power
of acquisition was remarkable, and, as
he advanced in youth, his talents were
evidertly not merely those which ripen
before their time. He was a grave boy,
and scarcely ever known to smile; and
this not so much, from a want of sym
pathy for those among whom he was
born and bred, for he seemed far from
being incapable of domestic affection,
but rather from a complete deficiency
in the sense of humor, of which he
seemed quite debarred. His memory
was vigorous, ready, and retentive;
but his chief peculiarity was his dis
putatious temper and the flow of
language which, even as a child, was
ever at command to express his argu
ments. In person, with a commanding
brow, his countenance was an exag
geration of that of his father â austere
even to harshness, and grave even to
melancholy.
A learned man who had guided his
early studies, struck by his acuteness
and his powers of rapid attainment,
had after much difficulty persuaded his
father to send him to a public school.
This decision cost Mrs. Falconet much
sorrow, who believed a public school
was a place of much wickedness and

cruelty. Her fears and anxiety were,
however, unnecessary, for her son was
at once placei in a position in the
school which exempted him from the
servitude which she dreaded, while a
very short time elapsed before, even
with so many competitors, his singular
powers began to be remarked and ad
mired.
His success at school secured for him
the university. He was always the fa
vorite son of his father, though thai
feeling on tho part of the parent was
never acknowledged or evinced. Se
cretly, however, the elder Falconet be
gan to muse over the future of this gift
ed child and indulge in dreams which
he never communicated to his wife. It
was agreed in due course that Joseph
should study for the bar, having left
the university in a blaze of glory as
senior wrangler and recognized as the
unrivaled orator of its mimic parlia
ment.
And what were the dreams of the
youth himself? Had he any? Though
of an eager and earnest temperament
his imagination was limited, and quite
conscious of his powersâ being, indeed,
somewhat arrogant and peremptory â
aspired only to devote them to accom
plishing those objects which from his
cradle he had been taught were the
greatest, and the only ones which could
or should occupy the energies of man.
Firm in his faith in an age of dissolv
ing creeds, he wished to believe that he
was the man ordained to vindicate the
sublime cause of religious truth. With
these ardent hopes he had renounced
the suggestion which he had once fa
vored of taking orders. It was as the
lay champion of the church that he de
sired to act. and believed that in such
a position his influence would be in
finitely greater than in that of a cler
gyman, whatever his repute. The ca
reer of Mr. Wilberforce, ever before the
eyes of the domestic circle in which he
moved, doubtless much influenced him.
It certainly did his father, for the se
cret scheme of the elder Falconet, over
which he mused alone, was to obtain a
seat in Parliament for his son.
No easy matter in these days, when
men think themselves fortunate to
reach the House of Commons with a
gray or a bald head. And yet men of
influence, by pondering over an affair,
generally strike flre at last. If they be
not men of Influence the luminous par
ticle generally will not appear, and they
are called visionaries, crochetty or ad
venturous.
CHAPTER 11.
The house of Falconet held a mort
gage on the West India property of a
noble lord, who was also a minister
of state. It was not in itself a good
security, but the noble lord possessed
ample property of a more substantial
character, and so the firm was safe.
The firm had taken a leading part in
that abolition of West Indian slavery
which had seriously reduced the valua
cf the property in question. Whether
the memory of this fact entailed some
remorse or whether they were influ
enced by the recollection of happier
times, when, for a long series of years,
they had been the agents of the noble
lcrd, and had received in consequence
a considerable income in the shape of
commissions and interest on advances,
there is no doubt that the existing re
lations between the peer and his for
mer factors were always friendly, and,
on the part of the commercial firm,
frequently obliging.
Now, this noble lord was so fortunate
as to have an interest in a borough
which his opponents always denounced
as a nomination borough, though in
truth he had no property whatever in
it, and could not command a single
vote. But he and his wife, being wise
and good peoplo were civil and courte
ous to the inhabitants of this borough,
which reached almost to their park
sates, gave them every year a ball or
two, went to theirs, asked them to
shooting parties, subscribed to their
charities, presided over their meetings,
religious and horticultural, supplied all
the wants of the great house from the
borough instead of from co-operative
storesâ and so the lord and lady were
what Is called "adored," and the
borough' always asked leave to return
their sons/or nephews to Parliament.
It seems that the son and heir ap
parent of the noble lord, who was at
present member for this grateful com
munity, had thought fit to change his
politics â what are called the family
politics â a great sin. and being a gen
tleman of honor and spirit, nothing
â would content him but making this
known in an address unnecessarily of
fensive and then resigning his seat. Mr.
Falconet, through the solicitor of the
noble lord, had been aware of all this
some time before it was publicly
known and had let the noble patron
oi the borough become aware that if
it could be arranged that his son, Jo
seph, could succeed to the represen
tation he should not only be singularly
grateful, but should be very happy to
prove that his gratitude was not shad
owy, but of a substantial character,
and so it came about that Mr. Falconet
and his son were Invited to spend the
Whitsun week at the great house,
and a public meeting in the borough
on the revival of the slave trade in
the Red Sea having been arranged,
Joseph Toplady Falconet had the op
portunity of making a speech, which
literally electrified the audience. The
speech, indeed, became not only fa
mous in the place where it was deliv
ered, but it was reported in the London
papers and leading articles were writ
ten attesting its commanding eloquence
and announcing the advent of a new
and powerful cadidate for the honors
of public life. True it was that it sub
sequently appeared that there had
been no revival of the slave trade In
the Red Sea, but that the misappre
hension had occurred from a mistake
in the telegraph, manipulated by a
functionary suffering from a coup de
scleil or delirium tremens. But this
did not signify and made no difference
whatever in the eloquence of Joseph
Toplady Falconet or the result which
that eloquence was to accomplish.
There was a dinner to be given at The
Common to celebrate the return of Jo
seph. There was a good deal of mys
tery about this coming event; some lit
tle hesitation for some time, and then
immense preparations. The truth is
Mr. Falconet had conceived the Idea of
asking the noble lord to be his guest on
the occasion, and it was a long time
before he could induce Mrs. Falconet
even to comprehend his purpose, much
less to sanction or encourage it. The
Falconets gave many dinner parties,
but their guests were always their own
family or intimate connections, or per
sons who entirely sympathized with
their chief thoughts and pursuits. In
short, their banquets generally led to
some religious ceremony and were al
ways accompanied by psalmody.
Though he regretted the necessity, Mr!
Falconet felt that it was possible his
noble guest was scarcely accustomed
to such pious practices, and, as the
noble lord would be the only one pres
ent who was unused to them, he could
not but feel that a due consideration of
all the circumstances might Justif'
in this instance of finding refuge
compromise by a grace, both
and after the meal, of unusual lengH^.
At length all was settled, the i:.
tlon was accepted and the day was
fixed. It was a fine summer aft*
and the noble gueat asked perm
to arrive an hour before dinner so that
he might '"enjoy the country a little
and see their place." All were a
uneasy and some were quite fright
ened, but Mr. Falconet himself
he must make an effort and his de
meanor was outwardly calm. But
there was not the slightest necessity
for this embarrassment. The noble
lord was the personification of tact ani
polished sympathy. His eyes smiled
with gentle kindness when he was pre
sented to Mrs. Falconet, and his gen
eral bow was so skillful that every one
appropriated it to him or herself. He
was most enthusiastic about The
Common, which, it seems, he had seen
for the first time, and said it was wor
thy of "As You. Lake It." He much
praised the conifers in the privata
grounds, and intimated he had never
seen any so fine, though the truth was
he was himself unfortunately lord of
the most rare and extensive arboretum
in England. He visited several of th*
glasshouses and hinted that there could
be few in England equal to them,
though he had at home acres of these
structures, which he had unhappily
inherited, and which it cost him annu
ally thousands to maintain.
The dinner was quite a family party.
Three married daughters and their hus
bands were present, the two sons tn tha
business and the two young ladles to
whom they were engaged, two unmar
ried daughters, the clergyman brother,
who had traveled all night to be triers
and was to return at dawn so that fcQ
might assist at a BiblÂ« class,
which he never had been absent. I
course, the new M. P. was there, and
the only child away was the sailer;
but then as a compensation Mrs. FalV
conet had Just received from him a let
ter on very thin paper and- crossed and
which gave a most animated account
of the capture by his vessel of one of
the most terrific slavers in the bight >f
Benin. She wished their noble guest to
read this epistle, which he took with
much courtesy, and then glancing at
Its caligraphy with a somewhat hu
morous expression put the letter In his
pocket, saying he should like to show
it to the Secretary of State.
The dinner was, of course, too elab
orate and much too long. The dessert
itself lasted as long as a dinner or
dinarily ought to. but nothing would
satisfy Mr. Falconet on these occasions
but a procession of all his wondrous
fruita â golden pines of vast shape.BY THE LATE BENJAMINE DISRAELI EARL OF BEACONSFIELD

rare figs of all sizes and colors and
bananas which in form and "a.vor beat
Egypt. Indeed, he had on this occa
sion some from that sultry land hand
ed round In order to prove the pre
eminence of Clapham Common.
The evening was short, and went off
pretty well. The yonng ladies had
eweet voices and were skillful musi
cians. They did sing some psalms,
but his lordship did not find it out.
He sat on a sofa in the evening be
tween Mr. and Mrs. Falconet, Jo
seph Toplady on a chair opposite to
them, looking earnest and rather
grim. They discussed his new life in
the House of Commons, and Joseph
took the opportunity of
that he had received some new Infor
mation respecting: the slave trade in
the Red Sea, and thought of bringing
the matter forward. "I think I would
leave the Red Sea alone," said the
Earl. "It was a miracle that saved us
from being: drowned in it before."
Mrs. Falconet looked grave, and her
husband quickly turned the conversa
tion by remarking that there was
great difficulty in settling the habita
tion of Joseph, now that he had be
come a Parliament man. He wished
to live at home, but that seemed in
compatible in the long run with the
late hours of the House of Commons.
""Wljen I was a young man,' 1 said
the Earl, "I had to rough it, for I
started as a cadet, with no great al-
lowance and with little prospect of
my inheritance. I found the Albany
a very suitable place for a young man,
convenient and inexpensive. Why not
try the Albany?"
â¢'We had hoped," said Mrs. Fal
cone!, "that Joseph might have found
an abode with some serious family."
"Ah:" said the Earl, "I fear that
serious families are rarer than they
were in Westminster, and he must
not be too far from^he Hou3e. And
now I will say good night. I have
enjoyed myself greatly, and I only
â wiHh I had asked permission to bring
Lady Bertram with me."
CHAPTER 111.
There are few things more striking
than arriving in the port of London
on a Sunday and then proceeding to
some distant hotel. An enormous and
illimitable city stretches out before you,
apparently without an inhabitant. Tha
windows are closed, the shops shuttered
up, and in mighty thoroughfares,
gToaning on week days with the weight
of wains and carts and carriages and
streaming with population, perhaps the
hansom cab <that you have been for
tunate enough to secure when you dis
embarked is the only vehicle visible â
and no voice is heard except perhaps
your own giving unintelligible direc
tions to some obstinate or silently
supercilious driver.
In the present case, however, the in
dividual who had secured the cab had
a companion, for when they had landed
ho had courteously offered a seat in his
vehicle to one whose acquaintance he
had only made during a short voyage,
but whose conversation and manner'
had interested him.
"There is nothing to me more strik
ing and so unexpected as this appear
ance of London," said his guest. "I
came here with the persuasion that the
English were rapidly renouncing not
only their own religion, but the re
ligious principles altogether, and I find
a scene which, for the cessation of
labor, could only have been equaled in
old Jerusalem."
"Manners and customs outlive super
stitions," said his companion, a man
who, if he had lost his youth, was in
the prime of middle age â of middle
stature, still slender, with an inscru
table countenance, for the color of his
eyes seemed to change while he spoke.
On the whole, it might be described
as a compact face, the features regu
lar but inclined to delicacy, the brow
square and the mouth resolute. In
these days costume is little guide to a
man's station, except to the very prac
ticed, and after a voyage the moÃt
fashionable and fastidious are some
what soiled and shattered. Neverthe
less, it would be at once felt that the
manner of this person was high-bred,
natural, easy and yet dignified.
"I do not disapprove of the Sabba
tarian Institution," said his companion;
"on the contrary, I approve of it. It
was a step in the right direction. It
Becured repose for one day in the week.
True religion would secure repose for
every day."
"That would be the kingdom of
heaven." said his companion, "with
which you were just saying these Eng
lish people were not so content as in
old days."
"When we were talking together on
deck," replied the other, "I told you
that I was a missionary, and I saw
that you despised me, though you were
too polite to express such a sentiment.
I am a missionary, and of a faith held
by many millions. It will some day,
and perhaps sooner than is generally
credited, be professed by all, and then
there will be an end of all our troubles.
I am a subject of her Majesty and an
inhabitant of Ceylon. I have heard
much of late of the decay of faith in
England, and the evil consequences
which may ensue from this. Being in
dependent, and long educated in these
high matters, I resolved to visit Eu
rope, and especially England, and see
whether steps might not advantageous
ly be taken to advance the great
remedy which can alone cure the evils
of the human race."
"And establish the Nirvana?" said
his companion, with a scrutinizing
glance.
"I see you are not altogether un
acquainted with the truth."
"I am myself in favor of a Sabbath
of seven days," said his compaion, "of
a real Nirvana, but my perpetual Sab
bath can only be celebrated in a city
of the dead."
"Death 1b only happiness, if under
stood," said the Buddhist.
"We are? at your hotel. This is Black
friars. Can I be of service to you?
Have you friends?"
"I have a private letter to my banker,
besides my letter of credit, and I am
assured he will take care of me. Fal
conet & Co.â they are eminent, I under
stand. Do you know them?"
"No," replied the other, carelessly,
"but bankers, if you have a good let
ter of credit, are generally obliging.
What is your name?"
"My name is Kusinaraâ and yours?"
"I have no name," said the unknown.
CHAPTER IV.
The receptions of Lady Bertram were
distinguished;* almost amounted to be
ing celebrated. An illustrious foreigner,
for example, after the Thames tunnel
and the Crystal Palace, noted among
his agenda during his London visit the
opportunity, if possible, of making his
bow to that great lady. Invitations
were not a matter of course even to
her own political friends, and murmurs
were not infrequently heard by expect
ing but omitted guests that their room
seemed to be occupied by "the other
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
side." No individuals, however, for
eign or domestic, experienced any diffi
culty in entering her salons, provided
they were famous, or eyen eminent,
and provided they properly appreciated
the transcendant qualities of their
hostess.
Claribel. Countess Bertram, was a
very young widow when she consented
to become the second wife of her pres
ent husband. Herself a member of one
of the most ancient and noblest fami
lies, beautiful, highly jointured, and
with an only child, who was a great
heiress, if the world did not exactly
express their wonder at her union with
Lord Bertram, they still, with frequent
kindness, would observe that he was
the most fortunate of men. But Lord
Bertram was one of those who under
stand women and he was a favorite
with them.
Tall, pale and somewhat fragile, but
of a distinguished mien, her large dark
eyes, full of Inscrutable meaning, while
a profusion of rich brown hair, all her
own, veiled In a straight line her well
molded brow and shaded with rich
masses her oval cheeks, Clarlbel re
ceived her guests; her voice low but
musical and quite distinct, though she
scarcely condescended to raise it be
yond a whisper. She listened rather
than conversed, but could seem deeply,
or what is styled intensely, interested
with her companion, and generally her
self summed up with an epigram, or
what sounded as such. ThÂ«n tne fa
vored guest might retire and record the
words of wit and wisdom in his journal,
if- he kept one.
It was amusing, unobserved, to watch*
the various modes with which she wel
ccmed her guests. Generally speaking,
the mass, of either sex, passed by her
absolutely In fear and trembling. The
beautiful head, grave almost to sad
ness, with a slight touch of celestial
pride in the recognition, just divinely
inclined Itself, but occasionally her
countenance became animated, a phos
phoric flame shot forth from those eyes
of Olympian repose and she held forth
the most beautiful hand in the world
for them to touch, and even to press.
These favorites were almost always
men, statesmen of both sides, who
habitually consulted her, neologlcal
professors from foreign universities or
wild radical poets, who found occa
sion, notwithstanding their screaming
odes to coming men and coming times,
privately to indite impassioned sonnets
to the queen of beauty, of fashion and
of genius.
With her own sex she was courteous,
but rarely cordial, except with some
young ladles who were her worship
ers, and certainly except with her own
family, whom she habitually welcomed
with a courtly embrace. It was a di
vine condescension, and meant to inti
mate what she was in the habit of as
serting that there was no family In the
peerage which, for bloc-d and historical
achievement, could for a moment be
classed with her own.
The daughter of Lady Bertram, the
Lady Ermyntrude, hf.d Just been pre
sented, though young even for such an
initiatipn. Her future was a subject of
frequent discussion in what is called
"society." Whom she would marry and
when she would marry? Large ques
tions â and then there were some who
fancied she would never marry, and
why? Because she was eccentric. Ec
centric in what? Well, they say she
had Ideas of her own. That is certainly
z rious. To-night it might have been
expected that she would have been by
the side of her molhT as Lady Ber
tram received her guests, but Lady Er
myntrude had an instinctive feeling
that Lady Bertram was not particular
ly anxious for her contiguous presence,
and she found It more amusing to move
Jn her own orbitâ but not unattended.
There was a German lady, Fraulein
yon Weimar, who was her official and
inseparable companion, and generally
erne of her guardians; a Bishop of cap
tivating' gifts, sufficiently serious yet
of a lusory mind, a prelate who ever re
membered how much the church owed
to holy women, contrived to hover
around her and was usually welcomed
and encouraged by her smile.
It must not be supposed, however,
that Lady Bertram was not a devoted
mother. She was a perfect parentâ in
theory. She wished her daughter to
have every advantage and enjoy every
delierht that was alike proper and prac
ticable, only she was too much interest
ed about herself to be able to spare any
time to carry her theories into practice.
Fortunately, she had become acquaint
ed with Fraulein yon Weimar, who had
gained her confidence and her heart by
her appreciation of Lady Bertram's re
sistless influence over men. This last
ascendant power, however, was of so
fascinating a character and it absorbed
the life of Claribel to such a degree
that in due course she found it was im
possible to spare any longer any por
tion of her existence even to the sweet
tongued and subtle mind of Fraulein
yon Weimar. So after some scenes and
much unnecessary diplomacy an both
sides this lady became 'the guide, the
preceptress and inseparable companion
of Lady Ermyntrude.
Her pupil had not the lustrous beauty
of her mother, and yet her appearance
was hardly less striking. She had a
beautiful figure, rare to see any one
more shapely, and she moved as ij' Â§h#
were conscious of her symmetry. Her
ec-untenance was delicate, aquijint,
with gray eyes, but there was a want
of mobility about her features. an<J it
seemed doubtful whether theÂ»r habitual
expression were a simper and a s*Â«Â«r.
Fraulein, although very few ytÂ»r*
older than Lady Ermyntrude, had the
mien and carriage of a matured wo
man. She was rather under th<* middle
size, and her stature was scarcely re
deemed by grace, but she had a bright
complexion, beautiful teeth, a .ora
manding brow and a targe blue eyÂ§ of
searching cower.

BOOKS, OLD AND NEW
THE presses of the country fairly

their way to the counters and
shelves of the bookshops and are
exploited in the review and advertising
columns of the newspapers we common
folk are sometimes overwhelmed by the
number and variety of the new claim
ants for our attention. And yet it is
a sign of the amazing Intellectual fer
tility of this country, and did we ignore
new books altogether we should lose
touch with many current movements.
But our attitude 6hould be one of
discrimination. Many books published
a year or two ago are now forgotten.
With the little time at our disposal for
reading books we want to choose those
which are really worth while. This
does not necessarily mean that we are
to limit ourselves to lengthy biogra
phies or learned essays. Almost every
season brings at least a few novelÃ
which not only entertain but brace and
cheer us for the daily* struggle. We

not many years hence.
These are only three of the novels of
current popularity which have elements
of solid worth in them, because they
come from the pen of serious persons in
sympathy with the best things in hu
man life. Indeed few of us realize what
a powerful ally the modern humanita- '
rian movement has in the ranks of the
younger literary workers in this coun
try.
But to feed on new books exclusively
is to cut one's self off from fountains of
power. The best thought of all the
ages Is embalmed in the books that live
on from generation to generation, and I
some of these carry as much sugges- ,
tion and inspiration for modern life as
they did for the age to which they first '
appealed. Sometimes wearied with the ,
glitter and glare of worldly pursuits
and of the mad rush after houses and '
lands, and external pomp, I take down i
George William Curtis' unsurpassed
picture of domestic love embodied in
that classic, "Prue and I." I read how '
that couple living on an unfashionable ,
street In a big city learned to smile at
the lordly Aurella arrayed in elegant '
robes, driving .rapidly to a gay party,
and to find in small pleasures, in their
love for one another, and in kindness
toward others life's richest satisfac
tion. Keep your affection, then, for old
favorites. Let them speak their peren

eometimes we know a thing so well
that we forget it. Some men have
passed all of their lives lookin' for a
big- truth and have overlooked all of
the little ones. And the hardest thing
to convince a man of is the thing he
already knows. It's no use to talk to
you about the intelligence and faithful
ness of a dog; you know all that as
well as I do, but I just want tq, ask
you this: What has that dog got to
look "forward to except to please you?
In the tone of your voice he finds the
color of life, dark or light. When you
frown it is cloudy weather for him,
but when you smile it doesn't make
any difference to him how the rain
pours or how the snow flies. He Is
ready to go with you. The night cant
be too dark nor the wind too bitin'.
When you want to go out the most
cheerful fire would be uncomfortable

a man in his family! Talk about own
ership! Why, you own the dog's body
and he gladly makes you a present of
his soul. The Bible teaches us to for

ligious than man. You may say that
this comes through fear, but the dog
Is not afraid to give his life for you,

here on my own land, but I've always
noticed that the feller that will beat a
dog will cheat a man if he gtts a right
good chance."
"Look here, old fellow, you may be
going too far. I never cheated a man
In my life."
"And I was goin' to add that the
man that would beat a dog would also
lie â if you give him the chance," said
the old man.
"What, and you mean that you have
given me the chance?"
The companions began to laugh,
and old Ljmuel quietly chuckled.
"Well, I'm liberal enough to give a
man almost any sort of a chance he
may be lookin' for. By the way,
what's your business?"
"I run a coal yard."
"Sell coal. Now that can be made
hs honest a business as any in the
world. But don't you sometimes guess
at the weight of a'ton?"
"Well, not exactly guess at it. I've
been in the business so long that I can
come pretty close to a ton by looking
at it."
"Then you guess at it, and did you
ever know one of those close guess
ers to guess on the wrong side? It's
like the man that makes a mistake in
givin' change â usually makes it in his
own favor. This may be honest, you
know â makin' a mistake in your own
favor, but it comes out of an under
lyin' principle of selfishness. And be

value in the way of moral suasion. The
boy who has a few tools at home and
a spot where he can whittle and make
all: the dirt he wants to will soon find
more pleasure In sawing and cutting
up a few boards than in cigarette
smoking. â¢ The number of small boys
saving up "to buy a tool chest" is
legion, and the tool chest, with a place
to use it as he chooses, will make a .
boy i^ possibly good â¢ where Sunday
schools would prove a dead flat failure.
A youngster of 10 years asked a lot '
of his acquaintances to save him mag
azines with pictures. His parents were
in rather straitened circumstances and
the young one's room was a thorn, in
his flesh, the paper being so soiled. He
saved up all the pictures he could find
about six months, then went to
work. The old paper was a peculiar old
medallion . style, on each of which he
pasted a picture, adding a little scroll
work of black and red pastel to ac
centuate the outlines. The mother of ;

sort, objected to everything, but a sen

henest way to short change you.
"A man may be honest as to dollars
f.nd cents and at the same time cruel.
I knew a man who always paid hLs
debts, but who beat his wife. Honesty
and gentleness are not always compan
ions. But the cruelty that applies to
th* 1 dog seems to be different fÂ»om any
other sort. When the dog sees by
your countenance or understands from
your voice that he has done wrong he
throws himself completely on your
mercy, and if in his struggles to get
away he should bite your hand, the
greatest favor you can grant him is to
permit him to lick the wound. Just
look at that dog now. No man in the
hot sun ever thirsted for water more
than he thirsts for a kind word from
you.
"I was readin' in a book where an
old man says to a King: You can
shorten all' my day?, but you rant
grant me one hour of life.' Over this
dog you've got more power that that,
for -ivith a word you can kill his soul
or bring it to ltfe. You may argue
that a dog hasn't got a soul, but when
a man is possessed in a full degree of
the very qualities exhibited daily by
the average dog. we speak of the de
velopment of his soul. Dogs fight over
a bone. Men fight over money. A dog
is deceitful In order that he may be
more pleasant in the eyes of his mas
ter. Man studies politeness and polite
ness isn't anything but a creditable
form of deceit.
"A dog is the only thing that glori
fies his slavery. A horse works for
what h e eats. He's always got his
mind on the stable. A dog works to
give pleasure to his master. He :.s
the only animal that enjoys a joke be
cause the man does. He studies a
man so close that he is a mind reader.
When you get up of a mornin' he
knows your temper the moment ho
sets eyes on you. Old m;in Cartwright
out here declared that his dog knew
in. a moment when he had professed
religion; and Cartwright told me. says
he. '.the dog quit chasm' rabbits on
Sunday after this. He'd walk about
the yard as solemn as any presidin'
elder you e\/r saw, but the minute I
cussed a cow and lost my religion,
one Sunday, why the dog he jumped
over the fence and started out track
in' a rabbit." Well, make friends with
your truest friend there and go
ahead."
The dog was listening. The hunter
turned toward him and smiled. The
grateful animal leaped forward with
his eyes beaming, strove to embrace
his master and then, with new spirit,
sprung over the fence to take up his
neglected work. "Old gentleman."
said the hunter, "I'm not as bad a
fellow as you think I am."
"Oh, I guess you're all right, but
you are so bent on your own enjoy
ment that you don't think enough of
others, and I want to say that dogs
are others."

and upward appearing at dinner every
evening in a full dress suit is too op
pressive to benefit the boy physically.
During the years when attaining his
growth a boy's appetite should have
full sway. He should eat regularly and
enjoy his food, and, above all things,
he should be taught to eat slowly.
Growing children should start out with
a good wholesome breakfast and dinner
at midday, or not later than 3 in the
afternoon, is more conductive to good
health. A course dinner at 6 p. m. for
boys in knickerbockers, dressed up like
little club gentlemen, is enough to take
the appetite out of any boy. Teach a
boy to be scrupulously clean, dress him
neatly with a dress suit for state occa
sions, make him behave as a 'little gen
tleman should in the house, but let him
get all the good there is out of life dur

him enjoy his meals, which no boy can

homeless boys. Homes where the at

the calm and quiet smacks of desola
tionâhomes so proper and so clean
where, as the youngest of three broth
ers once said: "Mother was so clean
she cleaned us all out," which, unfor
tunately, was true. Tfce husband was
a thoroughly domestic man. but his
wife objected to everything he said or
proposed. The least fleck of dust set
her crazy. For the slightest Infraction
or tnfle overlooked she would discharge
every servant in the house, until the
house became unbearable. Husbanl
and sons all deserted her for quarters
of their own, where they could, a
least, enjoy peace, smoke a cigar and
kick over a hassock. It is often a weird
fact that a man finds him homeâ 'The

Now that is rather a pathetic state
to be in, but really she is not half as
much to be pitied as one might fancy
at first. If she discovered that she was
always committing some breach and
didn't care much about it one way or
the other she would be utterly hope
less, but the very fact that she is bo
keenly aware of her deficiencies is her
great 6alvation.
Evidently ehe possesses the rift of
using her eyes to advantage, else she
would never have realized that she had
blundered. Speaking of observing re

woes of her own, though they did not
trouble her to such a great extent.
She was one of a house party of ten
young people. She was Jolly and lively
and intent on having a good time and
making: the most of every minute., but
alas and alack, her idea of a rood time
evidently had not included a course of
training in what we call "manners."
She sat at the table with her elbows
out any old way that chanced to be
most comfortable, and she took her
soup from the end of her spoon and
twisted her fork in a manner oecullar
to her own sweet self. Every one* in
a while she Jostled her next-door neigh
bor's arm and laughed an apology and
rattled merrily on. After a time it evi
dently occurred to her that no one else
6eemed to be laboring under the same
difficulty, and she took it upon herself
to learn why. First she looked keenly
and then another, and slowly her
â ommenced to move toward her
until she had them out of her
or's way and in their DroDer
place. And one more thin* I noticed.
In making her survey she saw the dif
ference in holding and handling forks
and she promptly took the hint and
profited by her leseon. Gradually she
changed her tactics until at the end
of her two weeks' stay she was prac
: remade co far as table eti
quette was concerned, and I doubt not
that fh^ had gained many valuable
pointers :r. other respects as well. Just

shown you what to do.
The?* days many hoetesses are served
and a .good idea it la. too. When
..rr-ip last every one felt it a
ten duty to sit and wait, no
matter if the soup did get stone cold
and the patience was sorely tried.
This state of affairs went on until
some resourceful woman put on her
thinking cap and found a way out of
the difficulty.
Perhaps she didn't realize that she
was helping the bashful and doubting
along, too, but such is the case, for un
doubtedly if any one knows what the
startling array of knives and forka
means It is the hostess, for she ie fa

of her silver chest.
Once started right at a dinner or
luncheon, It is easy to keep up the good
work, for, as a rule, the weapons of

and all one has to do is to pick them
up as each course comes alone. The
extra forks, such as for oysters, are so
peculiarly constructed that one seldom

this, for nothing will be expected of

SADIE (Engagement Gift)â Cups
are the gift that people ordinarily
send girls who have announced their
engagement, but if you know the
young lady very well you are privi
leged to send any gift you please. A
dainty bit of embroidery for her new
home, a piece of linen or even some
thing in the underwear line. I know
one lassie who had a craze for can
dlesticks, and a number of her friends
sent them in place of the cup. China
is so fragile that It is difficult to keep
more than a few years and it does
seem a pity that engagement presents
are not lasting.
MRS THOMPSON (Porcelain Teeth)
Yes, there are such things as porcelain
teeth and inlays. If you have a front
tooth that is broken you may have a
porcelain piece set in with two pins
and fitted so perfectly that you will
scarcely be able to tell where the two
are joined. Great gold fillings are any
thing but pretty and crowns in the
front of the mouth are very unsightly.
If you are afraid to try the in.lay, have
the tooth filed down and a pivot tooth
inserted. This is put on by means of
n pin driven into the root of your own
tooth. Insist on one thing, and that is
a perfect match. Now and then one
sees a piece of good work, but the col
ors are so poor that a direct contrast
is made and every one who knows
anything about dentistry marvels
at it.
WEDDINGS (Invitation) â There
are several forms of wedding invita
tions. but I think the most popular
form for church ceremonies reads:
Mr. and Mrs. George Edward Smith
Request the honor of
presence at the marriage of their
daughter,
Evelyn Isabella,
to
2t.' r. James Field
on the evening of Wednesday, the sec*
ond of April, at half after eight
o'clock at St. John's Church.
The blank space is left to write the
name of the person invited and it is
more used these days than "reauest the
honor of your presence" for the sim
ple reason that it is more personal.
IVY (A Red Nose)â The best modeled
nose is a trial if it is red or has the
uncomfortable habit of getting spotty.
A shiny nose is bad enough, but it can
be remedied to a certain extent. Are
you quite certain that your trouble does
not come from carelessness? Indiges
tion or ooor circulation are frequently
the cause of a fiery nose. If this is the
case a simple remedy for the stomach
will more than likely clear your com
plexion. Take a half teaspoonful of
sulphate of coda; dissolve in half a
tumbler of boiling hot water; drink as
hot as you possibly can an hour before
breakfast. Repeat the dose in thirty
minutes. Pure hot water is a splendid
medicine and certainly nothing could
be more simple or easier to get. Very
few people really drink enough water
anyhow and several glasses of as hot
as you can drink will clean your stom
ach out veil. It seems almost foolish
to tell you that tight clothes or bands
will frequently produce a red nose, for
in these days of enlightenment there
are few women who aspire to an
eigh teen-inch waist and days of abso
lute torture. And while I think of it I
want to tell you that ordinary wash
ing soda and water is a good remedy
for a shiny nose. Use a bit about the
sise of a filbert to a quart of water.

unless you can afford to hire it done.
There are sheets and towels by the
dozen, not to speak of table linen.
Why not go to some shop and buy
letters to mark your towels and bed
linen? They come embroidered to
sew on and really they look very well.
Plenty good enough for the average
present. Of course, table linen is
quite another question. That must be
done by hand and very nicely, too,
else it is far better left alone. Mark
your linen as you like best. Your
monogram would be very nice, but a
single letter answers the purpose
quite as well. It is lovely to have
your first name embroidered on your
underwear, but I certainly do not ad
vise any girl to do it. Too much
precious eyesight is wasted and it is
not worth the while. Use the pretty
little letters instead. They range in
price, but I am quite sure you can
get them large enough for this pur
pose for 35 or 40 cents a dozen, arid
for sheets, pillow slips and towels for
60 cents. I should think six dozen
towels, including bath towels; one
dozen and a half sheets, one dozen pil
low slips, one dozen table cloths of .
various sizes and four dozen napkins '
a great plenty. Linen lasts years, you
know, and while it is very nice to
have a goodly supply in your linen
closet, too much # is somewhat of a
care, for it will frow yellow if it is
not used. This amount will last you
four or five years and in the mean
time you can buy as you see fit or your
Income permits. Yes, Ido most hear
tily think a girl should have these
things when she is married. It is an
old fashioned custom, I know, but it
is a good one and I would wait a few
months if necessary to get a goodly
supply.
MARY A. J. (Shaded Colors in Dress
Detail)â lnstead of combining a num
ber of colors into a color scheme more
or less elaborate, there is a sudden
craze for shading some one color from
its palest shade tint to it's richest tone
in a variety of dress accessories.
You see shaded veils, shaded stock
ings, shaded ribbons, laces, silkÃ and
flowers. And the chiffons and silks and
ribbons can be so harmonized and ad
justed by plaits, shirrings and folds as
to make very wonderful color effects
Some times you will see an entire
evening frock of shaded chiffon, or of
different shades of one tone of chiffon
combined to shade perfectly, say from
palest copper to a dark time-stained
metal, from the lightest new orange
shadeâ cocque de rocheâ to the deepest
orange brown, or from a delicate

But it is most usual to" have the shad
ing done by the manufacturer, not by
the modiste. You "buy your - material
with its tints all "ready Ito wear." ?
The veils fare probably the most no
ticeable of the shaded effects. They
usually start white jor cream on one
side and then shade down through in

which is being: much worn; dahlia, a
fall craze, and deep copper. You seldom
see green except the cold water greens,
never bright red, and navy blue ; not
at all. Almost every color this fall is
subdued with brownish shadows. There
has never before been such a .craze for
brown, and ; never has there been so
many wonderful shades of this most
adaptable of Nature's tones.
These shaded veils are extremely
picturesque for country wear, and very
useful indeed to the girl who wants to
make her light summer straw do for
the fall. Suppose it is tan straw. : Take
off the old trimming, ; get a three- yard
veil, ; shading from cocque de : rocheâ if
you are a brunetteâ to gold brown, put
lengthwise across the top of the hat
from side to side, falling over from the
brim Just a half inch, cross at the back
and bring over shoulder, knotting
loosely in front. Where hat shows at
back put a bunch of shaded yellow
brown chrysanthemums, and you have
a pretty smart picturesque fall hat in
the latest mode. -
If , your ; hat : is white have the veil

As for shaded stockings, they are a
whim rather than a reasonable fash

whom stockings ; are ; fully ; a third of
dress decoration, or . for young girls to

older girls they are mainly reserved for

MOTHER (Picturesque Clothes for"
Little Folks)â There never was an
illustration in a book half so pretty
and artistic and winsome as the pic
tures children make in their old-fash- '
ioned little garments, with feather 3
and nosegays and pelerines and
granny muffs and rich laces and
flaring Victorian bonnets.
Provided little girls" frocks are
short and full and the skirts tilt up at
the back ever so little and the sleeves
and the belt are loose and "comfy."
there may be as many picture effects
as you like, and as much elaborate
ness as you can afford.
Once, however, a girl has grown up i
to school estate she must b<? plainly
dressed. It's only nursery babies who .
are too young to think much about
their clothes or be much impressed by
their prettiness, to whom velvet and
lace and huge bonnets and rlutterinu
sashes are allowed.
And incidentally school girls have
never dressed more sensibly and
wholesomely. Shirt waists and tweed
skirts, sweaters and felt hats, stout
boots and looso gloves, red cheeks and
bright eyes â here you have a picture
of the modern young girl en route to
school, ready for basketball at noon
and golf after hours.
But if she were a small person, a
kindergartener or just a baby, she
would have in Dlace of the sweater a
plush zibeline coat or one of moleskin
velvet, made long and cut circular and
trimmed with a rich lace cullar and
worn with ermine furs. ,
And a Victorian bonnet, all of white
tulle and liberty satin ribbons, with
tufts of feather a-noddlng at one side
and under the flaring: brim in front
nestling down on the smooth locks â
no curls for babies nowadays â two
small nosegays of small pink rose
buds.
Her muff, huge, a big, soft, flat
barrel, you've seen the kind in her
John Millaia' picture book of funny
little Miss Penelope. Sometrmes she
MM -i smaller muff, a crescent, moon
shaped thing trimmed with chenille
to match.
For very everyday wear, lovely aa
her bonnets are. they are a bit use
less, for they fly about in the wind,
and brothers do things to them. So
for playtimes she wears the pretty fur
beaver sailors, in brown or blue or
tan to match her winter heavy coat.
Little children do not wear fur
coats, tippets and capes and muffs, of
course, but an entire fur garment is
far too heating for romping babies
who are exercising violently every out
door minute. This limitation does not
naturally apply to little folks who live
in the country and take long, cold
winter rides. Coats are made for them
of white astrakan, of Tttyetan lamb
and white caracul, but tliey are for
driving only.
These white furs, at a fl*st glance,
seem very expensive propositions, be
cause they soil so easy, even when not
used for romping and playing. But
they can be easily cleaned by using a
strong solution of borax watflr. Th*
water must be hot and the cleaning
speedily done.
Take, for a bowl of hot water, two
tablespoonfuls of pure borax: then with
a sponge hastily sponge the^aurface of
the short nap furs, letting them at once
dry in the sun or by artificial heat. The
long nap fur may have the hair dipped
right In the borax water. ir you ao it a
little at a time, so as not to soak the
pelt. The skin Itself dries slowly and
is apt to rot if wet often, ", but no
amount of wetting will injure the hair;,
If it is dried at once and quickly.
Furriers charge nearly the price. of a
fur set for cleaning it in this very sim
ple. Inexpensive way.
Three things should be remembered:
That the sponge should never -be used
soaking wet, and that it/, should' be j
swiftly applied and the fur rubbed .
lightly.
When cleaned, if It can be dried out- j

like new.
But don't . make the . mistake of
trying to clean white fur beaver

THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALE.STORY
of Strange People
y AILED by enthusiastic disciplej
ml Â§ -'* Tolstoy as tne first real and
JL M -authentic tribe of primitive
Christians, lauded by Socialists
as the must perfect exemplars. of com
rac: Bl practice, and execrated in
generous measure by the Canadian
Government as fools and religious ir
responsibles, the Doukhobors arrogate
to ihemselves a considerable degree of
the world's attention. When they mi
grated from Russia in 1899 and 1900
and took up their homes on lands al
lotted by the Canadian Government
theorists followed their every move and
hung upon their success with gloating
satisfaction. When in me summer
and early fall of 1900 a numerous com
pany of this sect drove off all its
flocks, deserted its homes and set out
to meet Jesus Christ in some sunny
land where fruit could be had for the
abkir.g and clothes would be super
fluous, the theorists began to feel a
marked fall in the temperature of
their enthusiasm and the vulgarian
world at large commenced ; to take
notice. The Interest aroused then has
continued and a reading of Aylmer
Maudes book. "A Peculiar People: The
Doukhobors," viii ' probably be very
general. w j? ! -â¢â¢ â¢ â¢_â â  <.'
The bghJad.tixe /qftiyng^oi
this book is- not, Jininstructive-for; a
general compre.tje.ns.ion. of its . contents.
Many ye"ars residence In Russia, com
bined with a strong predilection for the
doctrines of Leo Tolstoy, had roused
the interest of Mr. Maude in the perse
cutions being indulged in by the Rus
sian Government against the Douk
hobors, then resident in the distant
provinces of the Caucasus. Animated
by his Tolstoyan tenets, this English
man conferred with some of his con
freres 3n the new philosophy and went
personally apd at his own expense to
Canada with the purpose of finding
there a safe harbor for the distraught
peoples. Largely upon the representa
tions of Maude, himself, the authori
ties/then in power in the northern
province made liberal offers to the
Doukhobors, which were accepted. The
Russian colonists came and settled in
the districts allotted them. Then
troubles began â troubles which the
author reviews in his book. The
Doukhobors proved more than an un
mixed blessing to the Canadian au
thorities and it is presumed that Mr.
Mat had occasion to revise some of
his ; . opinions concerning them, formed
in tV first heat of theoretical quixotic
ism. for he says at the end of his book,
"Personally my only regret is to have
helped, â /ever unwittingly, to mis
lead the Canadian Government or any
one -Vise. By this book, in which, I do
public penance, I try to atone for that
blunder."
In Â«... effort to trace the origin of
this peculiar people the author
acknowledges his Inability to fix defi
nite! v upon any one man at any stated
peri' <:f t;mÂ« who evolved out of his
own lively imaginings the tenets of
their faith. It is popularly believed
that the Qua; were largely instru
mental in prtving this Russian sect it:
birth, but to this the author takes ex
ception, basing the cause of the mis
conception upon the superficial simi
larity between the two faiths. It was
during the reign of Peter the Great
that the Doukhobors. as a distinct sect
which was in rebellion against the doc
trines of church and state then obtain
ing, first gained the recognition that
comes with persecution. Like the
Quakers they then believed, as they do
now. in the inward presence of the Son
of God, and it was their adhesion to
the principle of. passive resistance,"
with Its concomitant horror of war,
that brought down on them the wrath
of every Czar eir.ee the great Peter.
The author's further analysis of the
fundamentals of their religion is barred
from critical consideration by its theo
logical profundities.
One persistent component of -. the
Doukhobor creed, an element which
cements the whole sect together into
the strongest clan organization, is" the
blind submission to a leader that char
acterizes it. This leader, who is al
ways referred to by the mysterious a/id
indefinite pronoun, "they" by 'â - the
faithful, is elected in a manner.no Gen
tile knows and holds sway, by virtue of
a power no outsider can fathom. The
present head of the Doukhobor sect.
Peter Vefigln, a man of infinite auto
cratic ability and genius for organiza
tion, according to the author, Is really
a dictator, within the Canadian domain
as Brigbam Young was once un
crowned king and absolute ruler under
the titular sway of this ' country.
Though held in exile for long years by
Russia and â¢.!>â¢ being permitted to
Join the Canadian colonists after they
Books of the Season
had settled It. the land of promise, such
was, ir" ik thÂ»- blind faith in this man
that by many of the most radical Verl
pin is worshiped as a diety. And he,
keen diplomat that he is, is not slow
in encouraging deification.
The communism that obtains in the
Doukl colonies of Assiniboia is.
according to Maude, the most perfect
of all efforts along that line that have
been evolved. Faltering at first, and
subject to reversals in practice, the
Socialistic propaganda launched by
these Russian enthusiasts has at last
achieved practicality. The communal
idea is there prosecuted to its logical
conclusion. Everybody protesting
against it is forced to live apart from
the community; the products of labor
and the division of wealth are distrib
uted under the supervision of a board
of equalization. One of the results
which must come from this perfected
Socialistic idea the author forecasts
thus: ... . : .-..:
'"This result (perfect communism) can
hardly be permanently attained with
out some repression of the mental and
moral development of the people. The
dominance of the leader (or, in de
fault of a leader, the rigidity of tribal
or sectarian customs) seems so essen
tial to the existence and permanence
of such a group that loyalty and de
votion to him (or them), acceptance of
his ideas, and blindness to his fall
ings, grow to an excessive extent and
ultimately produce a revolt in men ,of
independent -minds.". ~*;r ~,f -
Despite. the very evident disillusion
ment that came to the author with a
near acquaintance of the Doukhobors,
he still retains some' of the courage of
his first convictions. This is his char
acterization of the sect as a whole and
the result of the colonization experi
ment:
"1 have no hesitation in saying that
it would be hard to find a community
consisting of an equal number of men
among whom there is less crime and
more industry, honesty and hospitality,
or more personal attention by the hale
adults to the needs of the old people
and the children. They are sober, tem
perate and healthy and there is ap
parently but little looseness in sexual
matters among them.^ Compared: with.
the fancy pictures drawn by some en
thusiasms, they are disappointing, but
compared with ordinary human beings,
they ar-2 a worthy and estimable folk,
in- spite of their obstinacy, sectarian
exclusiveness, suspiciousness and their
too great dependence upon . a fallible
authority."

PLAIN
Tale of a CHild
JTJEADERS who like to look at the
JY daily round of life through a
magnifying glassâ that is a
restful diversion after all these red ro
mancesâshould possess themselves of a
bcok entitled "Walter Pieterse," which
was written .several years ago by a
Hollander, Eduard Douwes Dekker, and
has been for the first time translated
into English! Multatuli. the pen name
of this writer, is an unfamiliar one to
the casual reader, yet we are assured
by Hubert Evans, the translator of this
novel, that the man who wrote under
that norn de guerre has been called
euphoniously the Heine of Holland and
the Voltaire of the Netherlands by en
thusiastic critics on the Continent. This
book of his would seem to account in
part for the appellation*, even if not
altogether to justify their application;
for of its kind it is certainly a premier
example of high perfection. ' '
Like the unraveling of a homely rag
carpet or the taking apart bit by bit of
an old-time crazy quilt is the reading
of "Walter Pieterse." Here we have
presented to us with faithful, almost
laborious, completeness the details of a
little Holland boy's life; of I the every
day. The sordidness; the ''pettiness of
his every environ, the deadly dullness
of circumstance and Influence- that
hedge him about, the blindness of those
elders, his parents, who cannot appre
ciate the lure of fancy and of imagina
tion that catches the boy in its graspâ
these things are carefully' spread before
the reader in cunning disarray. "-*.- What
stem to be the disjoined and" disasso
ciated elements of the story, presented
as they are with categorical precision,
blend to make a full revelation of the
author* purpose. A terribly real, al
beit a bitterly cynical view, of the bour
geoise life is that which Dekker aims to
portray in his novel. His cynicism is
not directed against life as - life--and
hence he cannot ; well be called the
Heine of â Hollandâ but against the
smug sufficiency : and satisfied com
placency of . life that finds > only [ the
lower levels and is content to bask in
the meager sunlight that percolates
thither.
Walter Pit-terse, the youngest son
of Juffrouw Pieterse, relict of a re
spectable cobbler, finds his life cir
cumscribed by the four walls of a
tenement apartment in Amsterdam.
The mother dismisses the boy in great
part from her thoughts with the
positive conviction that he is "queer."
And "queer" he is, for in the crannies
of his bedchamber walla, in the rhud
dy gutter streams, the ash heap by the
corner and even the screech of the
saw mills Walter Pieterse finds the
budding germs of fancy. Wearied be
yond repeal by the droning maxims of
his school teacher, the lad surrepti
tiously pawns a Bible in order that he
may purchase the wild romance.
"Glorioso." Crammed with visions of
belted knights and coiffed ladies,
young Pieterse peoples his sordid
home with shadows, feels spirits of
the moon and the suns at his elbow
and hears the breathings of long dead
tongue?. How he finds on earth the
embodiment of all heavenly fancies,
Femke. the washerwoman's girl, how
he falls into the snare of a feminine
fowler and finally achieves independ
ence â but these things do not tell the
plot; that is all-pervasive, finds place
on every page.
Perhaps a partiality for De Mau
paaamnt leads me to cite his works
whenever a novel of naturalism ap
peals to me, but I must believe that
few novelists besides this Hollander
Dekker have approached so nearly the
French writer's power of bringing the
inexplicably sad out of the common
alities of hum-drum existence. The
heart-break of "La Ficelle" and of
lhat longer tale, "Un Vie," are nearly
duplicated by Dekker's little tragedies
of a boy's disappointments.

WOMAN
Who Keeps a Secret
FROM the Apostle Paul to New
York's theatrical trust is indeed
a broad Jump, but Samuel M.
Gardenhire, the author, has spanned
the chasm in less than a year. His
earlier story, "Lux Cruets," was a
somewhat spectacular presentation of
the trials and triumphs that followed
the steps of the Twelve. This one has
to do with business, theaters, the foib
les and fancies of society in our great
metropolis. Now that it sees the light
close upon the heels of the first we
can imagine that Mr. Gardenhire leans
back comfortably in his easy chair
and congratulates himself that the
critics cannot cavil at his lack of ori
ginality. True, this is an unwonted
display of a catholic talent.
Mr. Gardenhire has found a woman
who can*keep a secret and for this
rare talent he honors her by affixing
her name and the fact in the title.

close interest to those of New York as

MINGLED
Blood and Timothy
a N odd sort is Ridgwell Cullum's
f\ novel, "The Hound From the
North." Part of the book is
fine, strong as any recent piece of fic
tion; part of it is melodramatic twad
dle, stilted mock heroics of the very
worst order. One is led to believe
that this uneveness arises from the au
thor's mixed intentions.' Upon the
fcundation of a story of mystery and
blood-curdling sweep of events he has
ei.deavored to raise " a very dainty
arabesque, compounded of character
study and the reflection of cuiiet, pas
tcral life. The finished architectural
product much resembles Poe's house
of Usher, near the black tarn, with
a Queen Anne roof.
The opening chapters of the story
are among the very best. Written with
a fine pictorial power and depicting the
tragedy of life such as Jack London
finds it under the Arctic circle, this
launching of the novel leads one to
expect a grim, powerful drama of
existence in its primitive form. Sud
denly the plot switches off to a quiet
farm in Manitoba, with cattle lowing
in the meadows and a comfortable
farm lady making apple pies in the
summer kitchen. The pastoral pipes
of Pan seem now to lead the whole of
the author's orchestral scheme until
presto! rank murder stalks upon the
boards and mystery asserts her dread
ful sway again. Follow alternate
treble of sweet country lays and basso
of heavy tragedy until the latter ele
ment asserts itself in a final crescendo
and the story ends with a delightful
tremolo on the minor chord.

>-â¢ -; TREATISE'
Â©sv â¢ ISoelily HeaXfcH
r HOUGH the layman may well be
excused for shyins at a book
of. such bulk as "Air. Food and
PJxercise," by Dr. A. Rabagliati, it
may be advanced with a considerable
degree of certainty that once he has
dipped into its pages a large part of
the volume will be digested before it
is put finally on the shelf. The work
would be catalogued on a library list
as a medical book and in the final in
stance that is what it is, but the au
thor has prepared this, which he mod
estly calls an essay, for the reading of
the uninitiated rather than the prac*
titioner. He gives a thoroughly com
plete and at all times eomprehendabl-?
dissertation upon the preservation of
bodily health through moderation in
eating and drinking and the sane use
of exercise. A popular book for the
use of all desiring to increase the span
of a healthy and efficient life is "Air,
Food and Exercise."
Dr. Rabagliati expresses his thesis
succinctly thus:
"The predisposing causes of disease
are for the most part the relations of
the body to air, to food and to exer
cise, with perhaps the influences of
anxk.ty and heredity added. I shall
hope to say something about the last
later, and shall dismiss it for the pres
ent with the remark that as a cause
of disease (though not of organiza
tion, which is greatly determined By
it), 1 believe its influence has been
greatly exaggerated both by medical
men and by the general public. And
I go on to say that of the other pre
disposing causes of disease by far the
most important is the relations of the
body to food. This statement is really
the main thesis of this essay. This the
sis may be analyzed into the following
statements: First, if human beings
were to arrange properly the quantity
and quality of the food which they
take, and also the times at which they
take it, they would suffer much less
from disease and illness than they do
now. Second, even after disease has
occurred or broken out, the best means
to co:nbat it and to restore the body
to health is by an alteration in the diet.
From which it follows, thirdly, that
the best and most important means to
keep a man in the health which by
the supposition he has reattained is to
prescribe for him a proper amount
and quality of food, and suitable times
of taking it for the future.
"A jjreat Latin medical writer, it is
well known, divided methods of treat
ment into three divisions â treatment by
diet (victus). by medicines (medica
menti), and by surgerymanus). And
he might have added, I venture to sug
gest, that, with the exception of a few
diseased conditions which must be
treated by surgery, those diseases
which cannot be treated by diet or by
diet combined . with exercises, which
for the moment he forgot, can hardly
be efficiently treated at all."
As a converse to this doctrine the
author notes specifically that cancer
ous diseases are due, in his belief, di
rectJv to the results of over- feeding.
The excess of life building materials in
the blood that is brought about by
dietetic abuses finds its outlet in can
cerous exudations, which are prevent
able by adherence to sane rules of
eating and drinking, but which, once
present. cannot, in the opinion of the
author, be cured.
As in the matter of diet, so in the
case of exercise. Dr. Rabagliati urges
upon us constant supervision and a
guarding against excess. Spasmodic
recreation or athletic exercises in
dulged in too rigorously must bring
harm to th<Â» body ur.dÂ°r any conat
tions. On the other hand, steady and
moderate exercise, especially for tbosn
Of sedentary habits, is as jnvat I
requisite to health as whoieaofÃ
and pure air.
' The prevention of disease rather than
the cure should occupy the minds of
all of us, says the doctor. And, though
this is a book of more than 500 pages,
it% author, admits that the last word
on -the" subject .cannot be found in the
limits of one man's knowledge. What
be Joes say, however, is wisdom for
the comprehension of the most care
less of us and incentive to practice the
rm-s of health he. sets forth grows
strong with&the study of the book.

over fond of dialect writing at the
best. It is a loosely connected series
of sketches of an old-time "nigger"
mammy (the preference for the
nomenclature is emphasized on th*
first x>age'Â». who finds a home as
housekeeper for a young bachelor,
through whom she becomes a sort of
pet of the arbitress of fashion and
other elegant ladies of a millionaire
set that swear at their servants in
public and do more reprehensible
things in private. There is a very
wonderful singer with whom the
bachelor, Reginald Thornton, falls in
lovo at first sight and who finally weds
an English lord.
Ir. fact, there are all sorts of dis
tinguished people in the book, but
"Mammy Rosie" holds the center of
the stage. There are some clever
things in the mass, and the author
has a certain gift for epigram which
would shine in a short story, but is
wasted in these discursive sketches.
The book does not rins true and lacks
coherence, in spite of its good points.

Thirty-fourth street. New York.)
Some of the friends of the late George
S. Evans, an attorney of Oakland, have
collected and published privately the
fugitive sho-rt stories contributed by
the young man to various California
publications for several years past. Un
der the title of "Wylackie Jack of Co
velo" this thin little volume of really
creditable fiction stands as a promise
of what Evans might have don
his life been spared for future yi .
effort. The tales are all bright, in the
main well written, and reflect an inti
mate knowledge of the picturesque Fife
of the cowman and mountaineer of the
northern spurs in the coast range.
Though the style of story that deals
â  -
with char>3 and vaquero3 has been
well nigh done to death by purveyors
to the It-cent magazines. Evans' light
tales have all of them a new flavor
which commends them to the favor of
the most omnivorous reader. The book
is on sale at Hardy's bock store in
Oakland and it Robertson's in San
Francisco.
"Eeing Done Good." the amusing
confessions of an invalid in search of
health through the tortuous paths of
medical science ' and * pseudo-science,
has pone into a second edition with the
added attraction 'of some very spirit
ed illustrations. Edward B. Lent, the
author of the book, is an ex-newspaper
man of New York whose work has
been stepped short by the ravages of
rheumatism. It passes comprehension
how one suffering as he must can
make such riotous fun of his ailments
as Lent does in this book of his. His
humor is of the richest. One seeking
the relaxation that Is resident in a
food laugh need go no farther than
"Being Done Good." (Brooklyn Eagle
Press, New York.)
NOTES
on the Magazines
A HIGHLY diverting American
y^j[ mysiery story is "A Transaction
in RubiÂ»s," the leading novelette
in the February number of Lip
pincotfs Magazine. Frederic Red
dalr. the author, seems to have
resnondei to a demand for strong,
thrilling detective stories such as
this loss of jewels at a house
party on Long Island, which cast
suspicion upon all the guests ajid made
them afraid to leave until the matter
should be cleared up. The discovery
of the thief by means of the impression
of his thumb is ingeniously dealt with.
Marion Harland contributes a charm
ing Southern romance entitled "A War
time Evangeline," which in substance
and style presents this well-known
writer at her best. "'The Siege," by
Will Levington Comfort, Is a tale of
Manchuria. An American promoter's
lovely daughter is the pivot around
which stirring scenes revolve and carry
conviction to the mind of the reader.
â  The Real Margaret, " by Ina Brevoort
Roberts, shows the astute New York
reporter, whose quick wit pierces the
disguise of an heiress who has been
marked out for matrimony by a titled
foreigner. Vincent Harper's story,
called "The Other One." is distinctly
humorous. In this the man who
missed the boat fared better than the
one who caught it. The author of
"Susan Cleger and Her JWend, Mrs.
Lathrop." Anne Warner, displays her
deft touch in dealing with human na
ture in the story she whimsically calls
"And Maude."
A story of city politics, which is
particularly bright and keen, is writ
ten by Authur Hendrick Vandenberg.
entitled "The Shrewdness of Haw
kins."
The Booklovers Magazine is emphat
ically .a magazine of the hour, with
this advantage: its articles do not only
reflect the passing vogue, but they are,
in many instances, a permanent con
tribution" to the literature of the sub
jects with which they deal. The scope
of the articles, as usual, embraces fea
tures of genuine Interest to humanity
the world over. It extends from Eng- '
land to Australia, from the fields of
Japan to the valleys of Switzerland,
with a wide sweep of things American.
There is something to suit all tastes â
political, dramatic, literary and artistic
âand a full measure of interesting
reading for the half-hour before retir
ing. The numerous illustrations. in
color and in black and white, are not
â¢only interesting in themselves, but
have in addition been selected with the
"object; of illuminating the text.
â¢ The , most conspicuous article is by
William Curtis Taylor, entitled 'What
Did Washington Look Like?". Mr.
Taylor treats the subject ; from the
point of view of contemporary paint- .
ers, and the article is fully illustrated
with reproductions from original paint
ings. ' A composite* '"photograph of
Washington, based , upon* fire accepted
portraits, is an important .feature.
The second article in the aeries on
"Th- Rt-al Australia" discusses the
political and social development of the
island-continent. Mr. Buriss Gahan
writes in an exceptionally brilliant and
searching vein, and pithily presents
those phases of political and soeti
ical improvement which have made
Australia an object of wond.er to the
western wortd. Portraits of some of
Australia's leading public men and
other.'' illustrations accompany the
article.These Are

BRITISH JUSTICE ONCE
AGAIN IS QUESTIONED
Man Sent to Prison for Seven Years for Savage Crime
Befieved to Be the Vict'm of Peculiar Methods.
LONDON, Feb. 11.â While recollec
tions of the Beck scandal are still
fresh in the public mind, another case
has come to light which presents strong
grounds for the belief, expressed by
so eminent a criminal authority aa Sir
George Lewis, that it constitutes an
equally woeful miscarriage of British
justice. Whether or not â  judicial in
vestigation, should one evor take nlace.

now serving a sentence of seven years'
penal servitude as was Adolph Beck,
the manner of his trial and the evi
dence on which he was convicted, it is
agreed, demonstrate conclusively the
need of the establishment here of a
Court of Criminal Appeal similar to
those which exist in America.
In October, 1903, George Edalji was
convicted on the specific charge of
brutally mutilating a farmer's pony
in the village of Great Wryley, Staf
fordshire, where he lived with his
father, a country vicar. The crime
was one of a series which had created
consternation for some months in the
district. In several respects â the dia
bolical character of the acts, the ab
sence of any intelligible motive and
the long failure of the police to ob
tain any clew to the perpetrators â
these outrages recalled the savagery
of the Whitechapel murders of a few
years ago.
Edalji was a young man of exemp
lary character, who, after passing

with distinction through a law school
and carrying off some valuable prixes,
had entered upon the practice of his
profession in Birmingham.
The evidence against him was entire
ly circumstantial. No one saw the act
committed. The police first assumed
that the deed was done at 8:30 o'clock
at night. When a competent veterinary
surgeon who saw the animal alive at
8:30 o'clock the next morning declared
that the wound could not have been in
flicted more than six hours earlier, they
shifted the time to 2:30 o'clock in the
morning.
While Edalji was in jail awaiting
REFORMERS WORK
AMONG PEOPLE
OF SMART SET
RELIGIOUS REVIVAL
Alexander and Torrey Enlist
Sympathy of Thousands
Across Water.
LONDON. Feb. 11.â Succeeding the
American commercial invasion of Eng
land, the American social invasion and
art invasion, comes an American reli
gious-invasion on a big scale, and with
a more daring object in view than any
thin? of the sort ever attempted before
--nothing less than the conversion of
the rich and fashionable London smart
set from the error of its frivolous and
often scandalous, ways.
The campaign already has caused
great excitement in Mayfair. The sig
nificance of the undertaking is most
strikingly shown by the number and
distinction of the recruits already ob
tained from the aristocracy itself, and
it begins to look as if the great out
break of religious fervor already begun
in England and Wales might bring
about results that will make history.
"It is wrong to suppose that the rich
are beyond redemption. Piccadilly and
Park Lane are as accessible to the
voices of religion as Whitechapel and
How. I am longing to see the picture
of the titled lady in silks and sables
joining in the "Glory" song side by side
with a lowly sister In the garments of
poverty. Give us a little time among
the aristocracy and you shall see sights
that should remind you of Wales."
Thus spoke Charles Alexander, the
singfn* American evangelist, who, wlih
his preaching coadjutor from the Unit
ed States. Dr. Reuben Archer Torrey,
has come to London to start this extra
ordinary campaign. For two years
they have been touring the English
provinces, filling the biggest halls they
could find, with the result that at their
meetings 56.000 people have publicly
professed a change of heart. .
Never before has the machinery of a
big revival been so well and thorough
ly organized. Albert Hall, the biggest
in London, accommodating 12,000 peo
trial another horse was butchered. The
police declared that they had obtained
a confession from a man named Green
that he was guilty of this atrocity. He
was not called by the prosecution, and
the defense was precluded from laying
evidence before the jury tending to
throw suspicion on a man who had
confessed to a precisely similar crime.
The petition which Edalji's father
sent to the Home Office contained the
signatures of 10,000 people. The Home
Secretary declined to interfere. The
Home Office also refused to show the
reports of the police.
Lubouchere, who has championed the

pie and situated in the heart of fash
ionable Mayfair, has been engaged for
services twice a day for two months.
Among the SOOO helpers enrolled are
many titled folk, some of whom, how
ever, â¢ have stipulated that publicity
shall not be given to their names. ;, A
feature of the work will be a hcuse-to
house visitation.
In the publicity given to this portion
of the . work those in charge of the
movement have struck their first snag.
Mrs. Webb-Peploe, wife of Prebendary
Webb-Feploe of St; Paul's, has enroll
rd a number of aristocratic dames to
serve on the ladies' committee. Their
names were printed and it was stated
that they would engage in this house
to-house visitation. Society was elec
trified by the news. Residents within
the three-mile radius who do not be
long to upper tendom were charmed at
the prospect of receiving such illustri
ous, callers. But the aristocratic dames
speedily shewed that when it comes to
canvassing for converts they are noi
at present prepared to play the role

Among those who have been con

the Hon. Emily Kinnaird. the Hon.
Gertrude Kinnaird. Lady Wimborne,
Lady Agnes Arden. Lady Kathleen
Brownlow, Lady Edith Acheson, Lady
Susan Byng, Lady Fox. Lady Hope,
Lady Blanche Sm.ith and Lady Maud*-
Vivian. They constitute but a small
representation of the feminine aris
tocracy. There is not a single Duch
ess among the lot and the solitary
Countess gets her title from a foreign
source, but the revivalists hope QM|
may prove the leaven that will start
a great social fermentation among the
upper classes.
Countes Bentinck, who because of her
rank heads the list, is a triple Countess,
her husband being a Count of the Holy
Roman Empire, Count <rf Waldeck-
Limburg >md Count of Aldenburg â all
foreign titles, though he is English by
birth and was for some years engaged
In the diplomatic service. The Couotess
is a German woman, a daughter of
Baron de Hecckeren de Wassenaer, and
has always taken a keen interest in re
ligious matters.
It is the Kinnaird family which has
the largest numerical representation in
the work and is doing most to push it
in aristocratic circles. Lord Kinnaird ia
a baron of the United Kingdom, and
his title dates back to 1682. Lady Kln
nalrd's activity in the work is much
restricted by the fact that she is an
invalid, but the Honorable Emily Kin

healthy muscularity with pious philan
thropy.

The world is truly very small. Every
thing is LnromanttcallT just next door.
You may escape > our > neighbor in
Tibet, but It is unlikely. In San Fran
cisco it- is Impossible. But I fear me
that some one has said this before. I
cannot, however, help it saying itself
again, seeing that the saw hit me with
the soft impact of a brick when I met
Madame Melba this week. Last week
1 had the honor of meeting and talking
with Mr. Arnold Dolmetsch, who is the
original, as he picturesquely owned and
1 faithfully reported, of the old musi
cian, Innoss, in Georse Moore's novel
"Evelyn Inr.ess." This week 1 have
had thf* henor of five minutes with
Madame Melba, who is equally unde
niably the original of Evelyn Inncss.
The rest of the cast â for George Moore
drew unmercifully upon his acquaint
ance for his characters â will doubtless
be in town next week, as it is only five
thousand miles or so from the scenes of
the novel.
"Could I see madame after her last
pong?"' 1 asked her manager en Tues
day evening at the concert. Very defer
entially Mr. Brcnnan. thought so. ' He
did not see why not, himself â though
with an experienced eye on the capri
cious providence that governs prima
donnas he would not be sure. He would
ask madame. Yes, madame would be
delighted, Mr. Krennan was delighted
to say. She would see me for a few
moments after the last song. How long
tJid he suppose I might have? Oh, he
did not know, quite five minutes, he
would say. I tried to look my grati
tude. Moments at 51500â 0r is it
more? â an evening are not to be
sneezed at. But en the v. ay behind
scenes the manager told me that I
might have more time another time,
but I have moments myself!
The diva had just finished her "Com
in* Thro the Rye." The house was
etlH wildly applauding. In the wings
fciood a smail crowd of devotees, male
and female. Signorina Sassoli, the
hsrpiEt, broad -browed and grave
eyed, stood there like a Roman Hebe,
holding a little silver mug of water.
Another woman, looking charmingly
like an eld French countess, held the
â¢liva's wrap, arid ejaculated various lit
tle Gallic enthusiasms as the singer
< ame off. Yet another satellite held an
other wrap, all soft grays and chin
tlnlla, and the others looked on, not
too near and worF.hipfully, as Melba
finally satisfied the audience with a
farewell bow.
She herself, with an agreeably unaf
fected air, sighed, "That's all right,"
us she came cut for the last time. 1
v.undercd if she would embrace the
crowd in the heat of her triumph as
i'atti did and does. She did not. -She
took a matter-of-fact sip from the lit
iie mug that Miss BasÃoli held, drew
1 "und I?er the wrap, an altogether
charming and ridiculous affair of lace â
Brussels â and fur, thanking the holder
in a French much less foreign than the
Australian kind she used to affect with
Mr. Grau, and then Melba turned
to me.
There was in her greeting a wholly
surprising, charming and quite distinct
t-'jch of shyness, together with an al
most boyish frankness and good nature
lor which report does not at all prepare
â¦me. There was not an atom of "side"
in her manner, and in a quaint, busi
ness-like fashion she asked me just
v. hat I wished to know.
"You mustn't keep me long," she pre
luded, â ":â¢-â¢ the girl in the fairy story
dropping pearls and opals instead of
ricre words. However, they had a
quaint â not cockney, say Australian â
flavor, that redeemed them from utter
unr arthliness. The next string of them
brought the divinity still nearer earth:
"You mustn't really keep me long, for
1 am going to supper with friends â and
I'm hungry," she laughingly added.
And then we moved aside to our small
chat.

on the other that of the King of
Sweden.
"This one." she said, touching the
English medal, "is the first one of its
kind ever given to a woman â " -
"Indeed?" I contributed respectfully.
"And what is the medal?" admiring: the
honorific gewgaw, and more the quite
charming pride of its owner.
"It is the medal of art, literature and
music," 'Melba informed me, "and the
King and Queen gave it to me last year
after the Covent Garden season."
I did not ask Melba if it were for her
courage in attacking the Brunnhilde
role, as she did at Covent Garden last
year. I would have given her a medal
for that myself. But I saw, at close
range, in the firm, small mouth, in the
snapping, brilliant brown eyes, in the
willful chin, why all the principalities
and powers, not to sneak of Slgnor
Mancinelli, could not prevent Melba
from singing Brunnhilde and Siegfried
itself if she bo willed! It was not a suc
cess, naturally, but the attempt was a
fine folly, an admirable failure. One
cannot refuse to it much of approval,
much of homage. To risk the silver
throat in the Wagnerian clime meant
not a little; the desire to risk it in the
interpretation of this noblest of the
Wagnerian roles means a whole Melba
dictionary.
However, I did not ask If the Eng
lish rulers had be-medaled her for her
Brunnhilde. I said instead that I
thought the Swedish medal was pret
tier.
"Oh. but you must not say that,"
Melba cried, in amused distress.
"But you are not English," I laughed.
'"You are Australian â "
"And proud of it!" Melba said, tilting
up her chin and throwing back a proud
little head. "We are more English there
than the English, you know."
"And where does the music come
from?" I asked then, "your father
sang, I know, and your mother and
your aunts and â " .
"Where dra you learn all that?"
the singer laughed. "It is all true,
though. The whole family sang. I
was only another." She told me then
of singing in the choir- at. Melbourne
when she was a girl and in a comical
little, piqued fashion of Melbourne's
matter of fact acceptance of the same.
"That was all before you went to
Marches! and learned to astonish the
world." I commented, and asked if she
still considered Marches! the best of
teachers.
MelbaVi "yes" to this was of the
handsomest, and followed by a gen
emus little eulogy of her famous in
structor.
"Had she a favorite role?" I in
quired then, wondering again if she
would mention the Brunnhilde.
"Favorite role? No. no," the sing
er said. "I like them all." Then Mel
ba tossed up that spirited little chin
of hers and added, "I sing nothing
that I do not like," and you would
have believed it if you had heard her.
You would have believed that she
neither sang nor did anything else
that she did* not like â nor -left un
done anything that she cared to do.
The manager came up then with her
chinchillas, and as she leaned her
shoulder to them the prima donna
peeped out. Melba actually pouted
as she said. "The programme was
much too heavy to-night, two big
arias?, you know â " they were the
"Lucia" mad scene and the "Fors c
Lui"â "it was too tiring altogether."
Mr. Brcnnan offered a soothing
"Certainly it was," and then Melba
forgot to be tired â If she ever knew
how â and called to Signorina Sassoli
to join us. Her pride in- her gifted
protege is charming, nor less engaging
is the evident affection of the tall,
grave young woman for the prima
donna. Melba told me that the girl
was only 17; that she had been play
ing harp since she was 10 years old,
and that she had discovered her a
year or so ago In â 1 think Paris. She
nodded an emphatic agreement as I
sa:d that I thought Miss Sassoli's harp
playing was of the phenomenal sort.
And then she took her laces and
furs and jewels over the stage, up
the crooked steps and through the
serried ranks of admirers that flank
ed the path to her carriage.
"Madame gone?" this was in Paul
Btefndorff*s genial thunder, and his
shining, rosy face and burly figure has
tily followed the voice.
Madame was gone Mr. Brennan ex
plained. -But she would be there for
rehearsal on Friday at 4 o'clock? â
from the conductor. Mr. Brennan
hoped go, but madame had said that
she was going to Monterey until Sat
urday.

CLEVERNESS IN THE
SMART SET
Is cleverness Inborn or evoluted by
t-ducation? Distinctive from ordinary
intellect, which may prove dull or in
â¢â â omprehenisive, cleverneps fills a pla/*e
and plays a particular part that is not
to he duplicated.
Tart, & synonym of eteveinj is in
ditpensabl*, and timely application of
the treit eaves many a situation and
surreptitiously binds wounds of the
head and heart. Society's demands
present many opportunities for the dis
play of cleverness, posse^Bion of which
a hounds among many of our women.
Cleverness may deal with the ability to
absorb quickly of surrounding condi
tions, and certainly there is no lack of
adaptability In the American woman,
whether she be of the smart set of
Gotham or of Pacific Heights.
Cleverness * stimulated by education
may be both parasitic or spontaneous;
if the one. it does no real harm; if the
other, its qualities are always tangible
and effective.
Our maids of Ban Francisco's high de
gree have, In the mala, enjoyed liberal
education, the advantage of travel and
knowledge of foreign tongues. Of lin
gual accomplishments, not a few are
conversant with French, German and
even the liQuid Italian. Illustrative of
this was the animated conversation en
suing between several belles and the
Protet's officers at the Assembly ball
on Monday night. There was real pleas
ure, too, for the foreigners to hear the
sound of their mother tongue, especial
ly when' accompanied by bright eyes
and framed with wit and repartee by
brilliant minds.

the Legislature and allow her to go on

HUSBAND'S PLEA
FOR HIS WIFE
Probationary Method Asked
for Fay Bucke, Convicted
of Grand Larceny Charge j
Fay Bucke, who was convicted of
grand larceny by a jury in Judge Law
lor's court, appeared for sentence yes
terday. She had been an Inmate of a
house of ill-fame on Mason street, from
which she disappeared, taking with
her about $300 worth of clothing: be
longing: to the woman who kept the
house. She was traced to Sacramento,
v. hprp she was arrested.
Attorney Glover, who represented the
defendant, read a letter from her hus- \
hand, J. Douglass Burke of Butte,
Mont., In which the man blamed him
self for his wife's fall from gTace and j
said he forgave her and declared that
if she were released he would take good
care of her, as he is perfectly capable
of doing. "I consider myself," he wrote, !
"more guilty of the offense than she, as j
it was my fault that she went wrong, ;
as I should have taken more care of;
her at the time and met her at the
dock when she arrived. If she is re- j
leased I will send her to my people in
Canada till she can recuperate so as to
be able to travel with me, as my posi- '
tion takes me to different places In the j
United States and Canada."
An affidavit was also produced by W. j
R. Thomson, agent of the Canadian .
Pacific Railroad at Seattle, that '
Bucke's parents lived in Ottawa, Can
ada, and that Bucke and his wife, the
defendant, had lived near his home in
Seattle for some time.
It was represented to the Judge that
the defendant came here to meet her .
husband. He did no meet her, and be- "
Jnpr without funds or friends she was
forced to become a prostitute. It was
also pointed out that the Jury had .
recommended her to the mercy of the
court, and it was asked that she be al
lowed to go on probation.
The Judge wanted further evidence
that the defendant was a married
woman, and suggested that her hus
band be requested to come here and
make his statements in open <-ourt. The
case was continued till March 4.

ENTERING HOME
P. B. Jefferies, a Chauffeur,
Attacked by Footpad Who
Strangles and Eobs Him
ASSAILANT FRIGHTENED
Police Notified and Find
Evidence of the Scuffle,
but No Trace of the Thief
P. B. Jefferiea, a chauffeur, was j
strangled and robbed late Friday night
as he was opening the front door of
his residence, 325 Guerrero street.
Jefferies informed the police that he '
was about to enter his home when an
arm was thrown round his neck from
behind and a hand grasped his throat. |
The footpad struck him on the face
with his other hand and jabbed him on
the back with his knee, while the hand
on his throat kept pressing him back- ,
ward till he fell. The footpad thrust a
hand into one of Jefferies' pockets and
took a purse containing between $4 and
$5. Then the thief fled. In his hurry to
get away he overlooked $30 in gold and
a watch that Jefferies had in another
pocket.
As soon as Jefferies recovered he re-ij
ported the robbery to the Seventeenth
street police' station. Policeman M. J. j
Filhin accompanied Jefferies to the ,
scene of the hold-up, where Filbin
found a diamond link cuff button that
Jefferies had lost during the scuffle. . A
short distance away Filbin discovered
Jefferies' empty purse, which the foot
pad had thrown away.

PUZZLE MAYOR
Questions Legality of Pay
ing Grand Jury Expenses
Tpon Orders From Court
STATEMENT IS FILED
Will Take Steps to Have
Money Paid Back if the
Expenditure Is Invalid
As a preliminary to the proposed in
vestigation into the legality of the ex
penditures incurred by the Grand Jury
in excess of the appropriation spe
cifically made for the purpose Mayor
Schmitz yesterday received an itemized
account of the audited demands of the
j Inquisitorial body from Auditor Baehr.
Accompanying the account was the fol
lowing letter from the Auditor:
Hon. E. E. Schmitz, Mayor:
Your communication of the 11th inst.
' received. In accordance with your re
quest I inclose you herewith an item
ized account of all audited demands of
the present Grand Jury to date. The
demands have been audited by me upon
the authority of the Superior Court of
this city and county on orders made
.and issued through the presiding
(k Judges thereof, namely: Frank H.
Kerrigan and William P. Lawlor.
Under the decisions of our Supreme
i Court, I consider these expenses the
same as jurors' fees and reporters'
fees, wJiich must be paid out of the
general fund without regard' to the
specific amount raised by the Super
; visors for these purposes. In the case
j of Jackson vs. Baehr, which I took to
! the Supreme Court, on this question the
; court said: "It is claimed by the de-
S fendant that the Board of Supervisors
has set apart $16,000 for trial jurors in
criminal cases, and that this fund is
t exhausted. That he is expressly for
: bidden by the charter of the city and,
I county to draw any warrant except
i upon an unexhausted specific appro
priation. It is sufficient in answer to
; this to say that the Superior courts are
â  State courts, ajid criminal cases con
| cern the State and are State affairs.
j The statute provides that the fees of
! jurors shall be paid out of the general
! fund of said county, or city and
county."
The expenses of the Grand Jury being
a State affair imposed upon the city
j and county by general Uw, I have al
â¢ lowed their demands on "â¢ â¢ general
' fund, in accordance with the foregoing
; decision.
HARRY BAEHR, Auditor.
, disbirsi:mkxts itemized.
Among the demands are the follow
i ing:
December â Rent oi rooms. $97 50;

"I will make an investigation in or-
I der to ascertain if these bills should
. be paid by the city simply because the
1 court orders their payment," said May
\ or Schmitz after he had read Baehr's
letter. "From preliminary inquiries I
am of the opinion that the court has no
right to order the payment of these

ing to do with them. The Grand Jury
has a special fund upon which to draw
and If this is inadequate the remedy
lies with the Supervisors to appropriate
sufficient funds. I certainly deem it an
illegal procedure to pay these extraor
dinary expenditures out of the general
fund. However, I will make further in
quiries and if I learn beyond a doubt
that the expenses are illegal I shall
take steps to have the money paid
back to the city."
Andrews' Statement
"When the Grand Jury was organ
ized I realized that it could do no ef
fective work without funds," said
Forerhan Andrews last evening, "and
I at once set about on a hunt for
money. Judge Kerrigan, who was
then presiding Judge; Auditor Baehr
and District Attorney Byington were
called into conference. The law was
thoroughly threshed out and we are
absolutely safe on the proposition that
the court can make orders on the
treasury for our expenses.
"It was agreed by Judge Kerrigan
and Auditor Baehr that they would
honor the payment of claims to the
amount of $1000 a month for a period
of three months. We ignored Mayor
Schmitz in the matter because we did
not deem it prudent to appeal to him
for aid inasmuch as his administration
might come under investigation dur
ing our investigations.
"I have a finance committee on the
Grand Jury that goes over all the ac
counte and then the whole body
passes on them. No, I did not item
ize my personal expense bills to Judge
Lawlor, who is now presiding Judge..
He has said he will O. K. anything I
sign my name to. I could not reveal
the items because they are a part of
the Grand Jury secrets."
The foreman described the attitude
of the Mayor as "a case of sour
grapes."

SUNDAY. .- - .FEBRUARY 12. 1905
MILES AND JEFFERSON DAVIS.
JOHN* SHARP WILLIAMS of Mississippi is probably not ft
statesman of the first class, but he is a trouble maker of a high ,
order. During the discussion in the House of a retroactive
rJaue in the military bill, supposed to be aimed at General Miles, he j
o^ed the clause, but said that although General Miles had been â¢
guilty of unsoldierly conduct in putting irons on Jefferson Davis
while a prisoner in' Fortress Monroe, and therefore was hated in
he South, he would not strike at him by retroactive legislation. This
ened Pandoras box at once, and the Civil War is being fought
- r again in editorials and interviews. It is all about an incident |
so long past that the generation born in fhe North since it occurred, j
and now the active force in American affairs, had not heard of it..
Yet it was an influence in blocking the several promotions by i
which General Miles reached the head of the army, and' that it was
cherished bitterly in the South was shown by jubilations in that
â â¢.ion when he retired. When Williams revived it General Miles ;
made a statement, showing that he ironed the prisoner of state in (
dience to orders from the War Department. An escape was;
feared. General John Morgan, the raider, had during the war es
ed through the stone walls of the Ohio penitentiary, and the.
boldness and daring of the Confederates who worshiped Jefferson
Davis seemed to warrant the greatest precautions.
Looking back at it now it is easy to call all the incidents of
n prisonment of Davis harsh and unfeeling. But looking back,
we see everything bat the atmosphere of the time. The war had I
ended. Lincoln had been assassinated, and an attempt had been \
made on the life of Scward. These events tore open the wounds of j
â¢ in every Northern home that had been made to mourn. The
North seethed with passion. Jefferson Davis would have been con- j
fined in a Northern fortress, but the Government feared if he were !
nth an attempt would be made, and would probably sue
9 rescue him from custody in order to kill him, for the very j
school children were singing "'We'll hang Jeff Davis on a sour apple |
tree. " he was imprisoned in a Virginia fort, easy of access by j
own followers.
He had been captured while in flight to Mexico. Many cool- I
headed Northern men regretted that he was taken at all, believing
â¢ he should have been permitted to go into exile. Their views
were iustiried by his immediately becoming a white elephant on the
hands 1 .vernmeni. It could not try him by court-martial, for
articies of war lacked in authority for such procedure. The
charge that he conspired with Booth and his companions to assas-'j
-dent Lincoln was insusceptible of proof. So, while pas- I
D against him rose to a tempest all over the North, it was evident
that its gratification could not come by way of any legal punish
ing caught. him the Government could not let him j
ape. Hence the orders under which Miles put him in irons,
en upon him for a few days only.
Eter public passion had somewhat cooled and the spirit of re-,
ge had partly evaporated, the Government regained its dignity
ighl the advice of the greatest constitutional lawyers as to,
11M legally do with him. The answer was. nothing. He
and unsuccessful revolution. But by exchange
mers, and in various ways, we had recognized the Confederacy
Then, some men high in the confidence of the Gov
l rnment were Thinking of the future, in which North and South
â¢nr c rward a> one to one destiny. This thoughtfulness wai
by the philosophical spirit of Horace Grcelev. who said that
slavery brought on the war which had abolished it. But if the
were not placated by moderation in the victor, the abolition
>u!d prove to have been a crime. As he had been a
heading spirit in provoking the war. his moderate utterances had a
far-reaching influence. i
He followed the logic of his position. The Government, having
drcided 1 ". Jefferson Davis on trial, adopted the policy of
letting the situation down easy, and admitted him to bail. Greeley
rendered valuable service to his country by becoming the first
the revolutionary chieftain. Jefferson Davis walked
Fortress Monroe a free man. and in due time all proceedings
against him were quashed, and he lived in his own country to a se-
rene old age. laboring only under the civil disability imposed by the
fourteenth amendment to the Federal constitution, which disqual
-:im to vote or hold office. Looking back, again, it may be re
â¢ at this disability wa s not removed. His generals, Lamar,
. Hill. Butler, Longstrect and others, became mem
and held other offices under the Government. His
\lexandcr 11. Stephens, served in the House until
â¢ ath. and if his*disabilities had been removed and he had re
mrned lo his place in the Senate, he could have done no harm, and a
picturesque chapter would have been added to the history of the
ilic.
Rut remember, all this can be said now. But if The Call had
in 18G5. as an advisory forecast, there would have been no
1 the next day : not a type, sheep shank nor proof galley, shears,
pencil, paste pot or molasses and glue roller would have survived.
Therefore how unreasonable now to say that General Miles should
have disobeyed the orders of the War Department and resigned his
commission rather than iron Jefferson Davis !
The daughter of Mr. Davis, in an embittered interview, charac
terizes Miles with harshness. That is her right. She would not be
â a good daughter nor a good woman if she did not feel just that way.
But she will excuse the country if it salute her gallantly and refrain
from adopting her view. Her distinguished father, so justly loved
and honored by his family, was not much of a favorite in the North
in 1865. But <=he should be gratified that time has healed wounds
and exorcised bitterness and hate, and the publication of her strictly
family view of the past will not add even to her own happiness, nor
v. ill it impair the respect of the North for her.
LEASING A RANGE
'THE Call long ago, and persistently, advised the stock rangers
of the semi-arid region to preserve the range and make
their industry permanent by leasing range lands and pro
tecting their forage by abstaining from overstocking. It is a matter
that concerns the meal, wool and hide supply of the country. The
most economical source of these is on the range. Since our
counsel was given the range is reported to have become desert
again at the rate of 5.000.000 acres per year, on which the forage
has been destroyed, the soil lost by erosion and the general store
of moisture in the ground impaired. Since then Texas has leased
all of her range lands with the most satisfactory results, and now
announced that an association of sheep men has leased lands
of the Union Pacific Railway in Wyoming which command 2,000,000
acre^.
Under this leasehold, it is stated, the forage will be protected
by avoiding overstocking, and the whole range concerned will be
protected from invasion by outsiders. This raises an interesting
-tion. The land grant of the Union Pacific Railway covers only
the alternate sections for twenty miles on each side' of the road.
The intermediate sections belong to the United States and are
part of the public domain. Any, citizen with livestock has the!
right of access to that public land. It is commons, and the forage ;
on it belongs to one man as much as to another. There is no law i
of discrimination that permits a leaseholder to control either private i
property or public domain, because it abuts his leasehold.
So it occurs to us that the Government is brought fece to I
face with the question of personal rights on the public domain
and must decide whether an abutting lease has primacy over private '
right. This brings up the whole leasing question again. Of course \
it will be the proper, orderly and sensible thing for Congress, under*
proper safeguards, to authorize the leasing to stockmen of public

BLUNDERS IN LOVEMAKING
AND BROKEN ENGAGEMENTS
DOROTHY FENIMORE
THE lover who blunders in his
lovemaklng is as pathetic a fig
ure as the woman at a card par
ty who never knows what's
trumps. Of the two the former
is the more worthy of commiseration,
for he rarely wins the prize that he is
after and the latter may have luck
that is out of all proportion to her
hopes.
One cannot help being sorry for
such men. They mean so well. But
neither can one help shedding a sym
pathetic tear over the hard fate of
the unfortunate objects of their at
tention. For the position of "belle of
the ball" or that of "the prettiest girl
in town" is no sinecure. Favors from
men who adore but bore you do not
bring you delight, and you would
rather be haunted by the family skel
eton than by an admirer whom you
detest, but who refuses to take "no"
for an answer.
The world has in it altogether too
many young men and old women who
say and do the wrong thing at the
wrong time. Unexpectedness is a so
cial grace only when it is meteoric,
only when it brightens up one's hori
zon for a brilliant, fleeting second.
And the wit of the staircase is much
more wholesome for society than is
spoken spice which gives some hearer
bad temper from mental indigestion.
The man who blunders beforo ha
wins a girl's consent to marry him
has no sympathy of mine. Then lie
stands for what he is and he fights in
a fair field. He can withdraw from
the lists if he wishes to do so. And
the girl is as free as he is.
But when an engagement has been
entered upon the affair takes on a
different aspect. Virtually the man
is bound and the woman is not. It
is considered a shabby trick for a man
to jilt a girl whom he has asked to
marry him, and he can be obliged by
law to give her compensation if_ he
does so. For a girl to break her en
gagement, however, causes merely
passing comment among her ac
quaintances. The odds, you see, are
in the woman's favor.
This is the reason why I am sorry
for the engaged man who blunders in
his lovemaking. He is terribly in earn
est. He is no different from what he
was before the girl whom he lovos ac
cepted him. If she finds that he doesn't
suit, she has simply to throw him over.
But if he like her so well as he
thought he would, he may have to pay
hi.^h for his indiscretion.
The chief clerk of the marriage
license bureau of a big Eastern city
considers that the number of unused
marriage licenses which are returned
to him form one of the hopeful signs, of
our day. It shows, he thinks, that peo
ple are beginning to use more common
sense in their wooing and wedding
than formerly they did: for no matter
what explanation is given him of the
return of the license the real cause Is
invariably incompatibility of tempera
ment â that plea which furnishes so
much grist for our divorce mills. "I
figure." he says, "that every license re
turned here unused numbers one off the
great total of divorces."

or, as an alternative, that the Government protect citizens in their
rights of access to its intermediate sections.
A BABY BOUNTY.
A GENEROUS Illinois community has resolved to prosper the
race by making a donation to every employe in its machinery
of government who, by taking thought, shall add to the town's
census roll. For one unit ass raise in salary shall be forthcoming ;
for twins the dole shall be doubled, and the rare blessing of triplets
shall touch the secret springs of the city's treasury for a $15 advance
in the income of their sire. To govern the distribution of these
prizes the city has declared that the submission of the infant before
the court will be necessary to insure the proud parent's claim for
bounty.
Now the city in question has the full idea of progressiveness ; its
upholding of the hands of President Roosevelt is a worthy and a
signal effort. But woe betide fair Illinois in general and this com
monwealth in particular if this scheme for the propagation of the
race is allowed to get into full swing. Who here in California does
not know of the frauds and the shame attending the operation of the
scalp bounty? For one coyote or jackrabbit scalp a certain reward
was paid. Straightway the man of guile found the herding of jack
rabbits and their care and culture a prolific source of income, and the
county suffered. Others found a way to sell the ears of a coyote
again and again and thus bleed the over-trusting community.
' If such misdeeds could be perpetrated in the matter of jackrabbit
and coyote bounties here in California, what will not be the pos
sibilities for fraud in the case of baby bounties? Will the submis
sion of the whole infant in evidence instead of the ears merely insure
the city in Illinois against being mulcted?
THE PORTLAND FAIR
Legislature shows a desire to have California properly rep
j resented at the Lewis and Clark Exposition in Portland. ' This
should be in consideration of our position as the senior State
of the coast. We are. already in position to transfer much of our
St. Louis exhibit to Portland, and the distance is so short that we can
easily replenish an exhibit throughout the season.
By current news from Oregon it appears that only a few people
there are escaping indictment, and our neighbor may need much
help m. carrying on her great show. So we should be neighborly and
go to the rescue. If the Governor is indicted, in addition to the
Mayor 01 Portland and a United States Senator, the situation will
be awkward in the extreme. But we should go to a friend in trouble,
Broken engagements are often sensi
bleâa bad promise is better broken
than kept. But they are always unfor
tunate. In the estimation of her ac
quaintances the girl in the affair is a
little more common than she was be
fore. The bloom has been rubbed off
the delicate beauty her girUÂ»Â« L
And the man's standa-i of womanli
ness has been lowered; either he has
become disillusioned concerning the' at
tractiveness of womankind, or he feels
that woman's faith is like breath on a
mirror.
The girl who breaks her engagement
feels, of course, that nobody can possi
bly know all that she went through be
fore she took the decisive step which
brought down upon her innocent head
the criticism of the grim row of chap
erons. Perhaps her fiance always want-
Ed to read aloud to her when she want
ed to play the piano to him. Or maybe
he liked to sing to her relatives when
they were all assembled in the parlor
on a. Sunday evening, and she got the
blame for it afterward. I know of two
engagements which wore broken for
these respective reasons.
Maybe he was given to pyrotechnlcal
displays of temper. He may have be>n
either too. matter of fact or too ardent
in his wooing. Or. perchance, she met
some one flse whom she liked better.
Of course, if she really did not love
him she was lucky to have found out in
time that she \vÂ«Â« making a mistake.
Nevertheless, an 'nejagement Is a holy
thing. It is almost as sacred as mar
riasc. It. is a relationship which should
not be entered lightly, because it is one
which involves the responsibility of
some one else's happiness.

THE ACHES AND PAINS
Dr. G. F. Butler, in an address to
his brother physicians of the Medical
Society, told them the secret of "how
to live long," says the Chicago cor
respondent of the New York World.
Here are his suggestions:
"It has been said that it is better
to be born lucky than rich, but it is,
in fact, better to be born tough than
either lucky or rich.
"When you have passed 60 don't
retire from business or professional
work, but be willing to put on the
brakes and be satisfied to do a little
less of everything, and do it better.
"Water is the greatest and best
j eliminator we have. Drink pure wa

"By the strict law of nature a man
should die as unconscious of his death
j aa of his birth.
"Eat less. Play more. Indulge in
. less fret and fume and more fruit and
j fun. Get out into God's great sani
! tarium, out of doors.
"Many broken down men and wom
en would draw health and earthly
virtues from the brown fields if they
'would take their shoe 3 off and run

"Those of you who feel that the E
string of your system is weak and is
screwed up too tight must bring the
rest of the instrument down to a
lower key or get out of the orchestra

RITA KELLEY
HE was a snuat china piece with

down his back. It was a stand

ing "home" that when any one dropped
a spot on the table cloth he had 1 to drop
a coin into the pig's hungry sides. Once
a week the porker -was slaughtered and
the proceeds used for flowers.
Miss Mattie was dressing for a walk
one morning when the peaked landlady
who quarreled with all her tradespeople
came to her door, pig in hand.
"Miss Mattie." she said, "would you
like to buy some flowers for the table?"
"Delighted:" Miss Mattie finished,
pinning a hugo bunch of violets on her
gray coat. "What kind shall I get?"
"Well," Miss Folke sat down on the

and they usually throw in some ferns

her kn'v until the last coin foil out.
â¢â Only 65 rents!"' Miss Folk* had a
v. ay of making people tlfflf lIWH Â°f
their shortcomings â the pig looked
glum.
"But aren't you glad you didn't get
your table cloth all spotted up."
. "Oh. that isn't it. But we shall have
to save some money for Easter Sun
day, and you can get so few flowers for
50 cents." -Mis? Folke had a grievance
against her trades people, and they re
taliated by Invariably giving her .short
measure. "Well," she stacked up a
half dollar in pennies and nickels, "I
guess that will have to do."
"How many ought I to get for 50
cents?"
"They'll turn up their noses at you
at a florist's and give you two or three
stale Honors that will be all withered
the second day. You'd better go to
the street booth over by the 'L.* sta

good flowers you'll come again."
"Stick up their noses at me!" said
Miss Mattie, ; ignoring Miss Folke's
suggestion. "Don't ever worry. Miss

. She passed several 'exclusive florists'
shops before she found one to her sat
isfaction. It was by far the hand
somest of all. Gripping her fifty cents
inside her glove she swept in like a
breath 'and stood in the midst of the
most beautiful flowers she had ever
seen. A remarkably handsome young
man was standing in the rear beside a
bank of palms, holding some smilax.
"Some flowers." she said, smiling:
and nodding at him.
lie looked up surprised. Then,
lookir.s at some one behind the palms,
he turned, spoke to one of the assist
ants, and came forward eagerly.
"Now. what would you like?" He
waved his hand gracefully toward the
masses of roses and crimson carna
tions.
"Oh, beautiful!" breathed Miss Mat
tie in an ecstacy. "I should likeâ"
she clutched the coins stowed away In
her glove and smiled dazzllnglyâ "a
flower for a penny."
"What!" For a moment it looked
as though the young man was going to
prove disagreeable.
Miss Matties smile became momen
tarily more bewitching.
"Yes," she continued, whirling her
muff airily around her hand, "I just
slaughtered the boarding-house pig
and I want all the nice flowers you can
give ma for fifty cents. Aren't those
lovely!" She pointed to some rare
orchids.
The young man was amused. Miss
Mattie was good to look at and had
au unmistakable air of being accus
tomed to beautiful things. Yet, 50
cents for orchidsâ which she distinctly
seemed to favor! He coughed apolo
getically.
"Flowers are rather expensive," he
ventured.
'Yes, I know," laughed Miss Mattie.
"These must be terribly high." She
touched the violets on her coat linger
ingly. "Think of the money you ex
tort from rich young men! And I've
only 50 cents. It was all the pig
cculd spare. We had to save gome for
Easter, you know, and no one got
many spots on the table cloth this
week."
The florist answered her smile.
"The pig gets the money for the
spots," she explained.
The young man looked as though he
â were immensely Interestedâ in the pig.
"What would you like?" he asked
again.
"I want just the most nice fresh
flowers you can give me for half a
dollar. It makes no difference â¢ what
kind. They told me I couldn't get any
for so little money." Miss Mattie
smiled. The man bowed low.
"I'll see what I can do for you, mm
said and strode to the rear of the storm.
Miss Mattie watched him admirtns
ly as he stopped to speak to one of thÂ»
men before he entered the ice room.
She had not known such nice young
men kept florists' shops. She movM
a step or two to the right of the palm
in order to see him more distinctly.
He was taking: down one crimson
carnation after the other, a spray of
narcissus, some roses, an orchid.
Miss Mattie looked away, afraid to
trust her own eyes. He seemed rather
an easily embarrassed young manâ or
was he amused? Miss Mattie did not
dare to risk the doubt, for if he saw
her observing him he might stop add
in? to the bunch. Miss Mattie had
reasons of her own for wishing as big
a bouquet as possible. It signified, la
a way, her sphere of influence on tha
I susceptibilities of the young man.

The young man turned from the

i ever so slightly and smiled.
"All those for fifty cents?" Miss Mat

eyes were wide with wonder.
The young man laughed as* ha

I the palms.
"I wouldn't do this for every one,
you understand. But I felt sorry for

"But there are too many. You can't

"Yes. I can. The pig may demand

"Yes. indeed, we get loads of flow
ers, and this is the very prettiest shop
on the street." She smiled. "Are you

are. I'm coming again Saturday."
His face wore a broad smile as he
turned, after bowing her but. and met
an irritable chap emerging from behind
the palms.
"You're a nice one," complained the
chap, "flirting with my lady."
â¢Jack:" innocently, "is she. really?"
"Of course. Didn't you see my -violets

The young man laughed.
"Just cancel that order for these

TELEPHONEâ W. 8., Oakland,
Cal. The principle of the telephone,
that sounds could be conveyed to a
distance by a distended wire, was dem
onstrated by Robert Hook, In 188 T. but
no practical application of the discov
ery was made until 1821, when Profes
sor Wheatstone exhibited his "enchant
ed lyre," in which the sounds of a mu
sic box were conveyed from a cellar to
upper , rooms. It is claimed that Â« tha
first true discoverer of the speaking
telephone was.Phllipp- Rets, a German
scientist and professor In the Institute
at Friedrichsdorf. He "exhibited his
telephone at Frankfort April 25, IS6I.
This contained all the essential fea
tures of the modern phone, but as tho
discovery was not comprehended, from
a point of commercial value, therefore
little attention was ' paid 'to it. After
many vain efforts to interest people in
the matter he died in 1874 without hav
ing reaped any benefit from his discov
ery. In the meantime the matter was
being worked into more practical shape
by Professor Elisha Gray and Profes
sor A. G. Bell and later by Thomas
Edison. It Is claimed that Gray's suc
cessful experiments . long antedated
those of the others, but Professor Bell
was : the first to " perfect his patent.
February 12. 1377,- Bell's articulating
telephone was tested at Boston and
Salem, Mass. It was found to convey
sounds distinctly from one place to the
other a distance of eighteen miles. On
July 21, 1882, the examiner of patents
at "Washington, D. C. decided that
Professor Bell was the first Inventor,
because he was the first to complete
his Invention and secure a full patent.

Mr. Phipps* project, when pushed to
the logical conclusion which he has in
mind, has for its object the complete
regeneration of the housing and sani

of the population living on Manhattan
Island. For notwithstanding the fact
that the present intent of the movement
being inaugurated by his gift is the al
leviation of the miseries of the very
poor in the abolishment of the dark
warrens where they are forced to live
under conditions all but intolerable, the
general effect of the bettering of such
conditions must ultimately bring with
it an improvement in the housing fa
cilities of every family that lives in a
liat or apartment house.
Mr. Phipps Is not only one of the
most modest of our great philanthro

most practical. He has absolutely no

MODEL TENEMENTS.
Since the announcement of the be
quest Mr. Phlppa and his associates
have been besieged with questions rela
tive to the proposed improvement. The
question often, st asked, and of most
importance, perhaps, is that regarding
the personnel of the tenancy. What
measures, if any, will be taken to re
strict the tenancy to the class of people
for whom the model houses are to be
builtâ Is. the very poor? All such
inquirers Mr. Phipps refers to Dr.
Gould, whose experience in the building
and management of the model tene
ments already existing in New York is
of much practical value in the solution
of this difficulty which insists upon pre
senting itself in the minds of the du
bious.
"That is a problem which has really
given us no difficulty whatever," said
Dr. Gould. "We find- invariably that
the people who seek house room in" our
model tenements are precisely the class
for whom those tenements were built.
In the Alfred Corning Clarke buildings
we have 360 people A roster of their
trades and professions shows them to
be invariably artisans and common la
boring people. There is one doctor, one
dentist, one dancing teacher, one stamp
and coin collector. The largest number
of any one calling is that of waiters,
Who number twenty-four: next in order
come clerks, with a total of twenty.
There are fifteen street car conductors,
twelve dressmakers, ten general day
workers. The rest of the number are
divided Into fifty-seven lines of employ
ment, all more or less humble and of
precarious nature."
The exact location for the buildings
ha? not yet been decided, though the
likelihood is that some will be in Har
lem and Rome in the lower east side,
provided appropriate sites can be ob
tained at reasonable ficrures. "If land
be found to be tor, costly, or if building
conditions are such as to threaten un
due cost of construction or unreasona
ble delay, then we will build in other
borrvusrhs of the city, or elsewhere,"
fays Mi. Phippp, who outlines his
scheme as follows:
A BUSINESS PROPOSITION.
"I expect the tenements to be so plan
ned ajs to earn about 4 per cent on
their cost, after allowing a proper
amount for maintenance and repairs. I
intend to have the earnings accumulate
and to be used from time to time in
erecting more tenements. My wish is
that the rooms should not be rented at
a price below the market rate. I do not
wish to discourage individual investors
from building tenements on a purely
business basis. To do so might check
building operations, raise rents and in
thr- end prove injurious to the working
â¢. whom I wish to aid and who
must rely in so large a measure on
building for purely business reasons to
provide them with homes.
"If there is a period of high cost and
great inflation then the work should go

One of the most vital questions of to-
I day is matrimony and Its antithe?jp, di
vorce. Matrimony is the foundation of
society, and divorce is the ruin or the
pulling down of the foundation laid by
| matrimony. This question affects not
| one creed, one nationality or one race
! alone, but it affects the whole of the
I human race. Though the public is di
i vided on the real merits of the ques
tion, yet this does not change the na
i ture of matrimony. In this as in many
I other issues, the public is very often
| misled by others and especially by the
want of personal thinking and reason
ing. If after listening to others we
should study the subject matter, then
: we would not be like ordinary automa
| ta, thinking machines or talking phono
i graphs, but we would be something
I moreâ that is, men and women of con
; vinoed ideas and progressive at the
time, because we would add to tho
ideas of others our own conviction and
rience. Kb man can become great
j in any branch if he dispenses himself
-I this rule. Thus without wishing to
enter Into a controversy against those
may believe in marriage and di
\ur< c and race suicide, I will venture
to prove its fundamental principle and
j in a,plain manner bring it home, as it
I were, to the kind consideration of the
i impartial reader.
Matrimony does not belong to one
:, to one nation or to one genera
tion, but it bi longs to all creeds, na
tions and generations, because its
origin and end are not from man, but
from God and for God. Therefore,
matrimony i? not a mere civil con
tract, but a natural and religious con
tract instituted by God, when he cre
ated Adam and Eve and ordered them
to increase and multiply and lill the

very slowly or be stopped. On the
Other hand, if there is a period of great
depression and lack of employment it
may be well to go fast and perhaps
have more than one building under
way at the same time.
"It would certainly b*Â» nn advantage
to have one building finished and rented,
and see how it rents and suits tenants
before starting to erect a second. My
object is to make the money do as
much good as possible.
"I should like the buildings to have
all the light and air possible, to have
them fireproof and thoroughly sanitary,
and so far as possible to have spaces
around them in which the children
could play.
MR. PHiPPS' ONLY HOBBY.
"It may be well to erect buildings
for perhaps two or three classes of
wage earners, or It may possibly be
better to confine ourselves to one class,
hoping thus to relieve the market, and
incidentally benefit another class. I
shall look with great interest to the
progress of the work, and I hope to see
much of it finished while I am here to
enjoy it."
Mr. Henry Phipps probably gives
more thought to his philanthropy than
any other man who is willing and able
to give away millions. His latest pro
ject, the building of model tenement
houses for the very poor of New York
City, is but added evidence of his meth
ods. His every act of philanthropy has
been with an idea of reaching down
into the lowest stratum of human ex
istence and endeavoring to lift people
up to a higher plane of life.
If Mr. Phipps has a "hobby" it is the
love of nature, but this "hobby" has
only influenced his philanthropy In a
minor degree. His first gift of conse
quence was about twenty years ago,
when he built a conservatory in the
public parks of Allegheny, Pa., then his
home. In his great love of the natural
earth; and the same blessing God or
dered to Noah and his sons. Conse
quently, according to the natural law
established by the Creator, matrimony
Is absolutely necessary in order to in
crease and multiply and fill the earth
with human beings. This is the dogma
contained in the sacred pages of the
Old Testament, aijd this is the prevail
ing doctrine of all men of common
sense.

IT WAS A HOLY ORDER.
A Philadelphian who recently return
ed from a trip to Florida, in narrating
some tit his experiences, says that it
is almost impossible to conceive how
great was the rush of visitors at the
height of the season, writes John H.
Sinberg in the current Lippincott's. Il

told the following aneddote: "One day

beauties of the world he felt it his
duty to give others an opportunity to
see and to understand. In his own
home he had a conservatory filled with
the flora and fauna of every land and
clime, but it was not possible to invite
the people of the whole city to come
to see and to enjoy those /beauties. He
therefore gave to the Park Commission
of the city a sum of money sufficient to
build a much larger conservatory and
to gather together, an even better col
lection than his own. Thus he felt he
was giving the poorest people of his
home city an opportunity to get away
from their workaday existence and into
a higher sphere of life.
A WORSHIPER OF NATURE.
Some years later Mr. Phipps present
ed the city of Pittsburg with the mag
nificent conservatory now one of the
chi^f points of int i t in Schenley
Park and provided for annual flower
shows in the various seasons. This is
much larger than the Allegheny con
servatory, because it is located in a
more populous district and reaches
more people. Mr. Phipps felt that the
people of Pittsburg were well supplied
with the creature comforts. Wages are
high and work plentiful, so that there
are few of the very poor in the city.
But there was then lacking in Pittsburg
the many essentials for mental and
spiritual growth, and Mr. Phipps felt
that there was more need of the ideal
than the material.
Long before he became known as a
with his new dispensation, he began
his public life by blessing the biblical
wedding of Cana and by making on
that occasion the first miracle recorded
of him, and that is the changing of
the water into wine, and elevating the
dignity of matrimony by adding a new
grace, a sacrament for all his follow
ers; so that since then two Christians
cannot be validly married without re
ceiving the sacrament of Christ, though
non-Christians may be validly married
to prevent the monopoly of the
heavens.

a man came to one of the big hotels
and was told that there was no room
.for him in the house, but that a place
to sleep could be made up in the me
morial chapel on the hotel grounds if
he desired. The visitor replied that he
was satisfied. By bedtime he had par
taken of all that he could stand In the
way of unsolidifled refreshments. When
he woke up in the morning he looked
philanthropist, even while he was in th e
very prosaic business of building up a
fortune through the medium of steel
rails and ingots and pigiron, Mr.
Phipps was known as an idealist. "While
others went to church on Sunday morn
ings he, with Professor John A. Bras
hoar, and sometimes Andrew Carnegie,
would go into the fields and woods that
line the beautiful hills back of Alle
gheny and worship at the shrine of na
ture. To him there was to be found
the greatest joy in life to get away
from people and into a land unscarred
by the touch of the hand of the ma
terialist.
The modesty and retiring disposition
of Mr. Phipps are proverbial among his
friends and acquaintances. He has al
ways lived largely within himself, and
has avoided, as far as possible, ming
ling with people. To him the proverb
that "To give is better than to receive"
seems to be wholly personal, and it is
his desire to be known as little in his
philanthropy as the exigencies require.
On the day that the Schenley Park
Conservatory was first thrown open to
the " Ã¼blic Mr. Phipps made an early
visit to inspect his gift in its completed
form. In his enthusiasm he forgot
time as he was conducted by the di
rector from one point to another. When
the opening hour came he was in a far
corner of the conservatory inspecting
some rare plants and palms. Before he
knew it the doors were thrown open
and Mr. Phipps saw hundreds of people
pouring in and scattering along the
before God and men without the sacra
ment.
The primary object of matrimony is
to increase and multiply and fill the
earth with human beings; and sec
ondly, for husband and wife to help,
love and console c: h other. This is in
dispensable in order to carry out the
destiuy of divine providence.
The husband and wife who do not

aisles. He was caught as in a trap,
and for the first and only time in hin
life he was present at the dedication
of one of his gifts. Perhaps it was
"stage fright," but his friends declare
it whs modesty that caused him to hide
in a dark corner, protected from view
by a huge palm tree. There he. re
mained for four hours while the crowds
came and went, refusing to try to reach
an exit until he was fully assured that
he would not be seen.
HIS MANY PHILANTHROPIES.
These conservatories are the only gifts
of Mr. Phipps that have not been ma
terialistic. In all his other gifts he
has tried to help people who were
"down and out" and could not help
themselves. His gift of an agricultural
college to India carried with it the hope
that the people of India could be taught
means to prevent the terrible famines
that every few years devastate the land
and claim thousands of victims by
starvation. He knew there was a rem
edy and he immediately provided the
means to discover and apply it. It may
require many years to develop such a
remedy, but it was Mr. Phipps who saw
the first step that should be taken. Hi
had the same idea in view when he
gave $250,000 to help the Trans vrval
burghers rehabilitate their farms after
the close of the disastrous war which
cost them their independence. He knew
that it would require only a little aid
at the beginning to put them on their
feet again, and his hand was in his
pocket almost before the thought was
in his mind. It was not the fault of
Mr. Phipps, by the way, that the
burghers learned to whom they were
indebted for this timely helping hand.
He gave his check with the understand
ing that his name should not be made
public. However, such a secret is too
big to long remain a secret.
The most universal of the philan
thropips of Mr. Phipps. the one that
will reach the greatest number of peo
ple every year, undoubtedly is the hos
, pital for consumptives In Philadelphia.
His munificence not only paid for the
! erection and equipment of the building,
; but provided an endowment fund, leav
ing no burden to be shouldered by fu
ture generations of philanthropic citi
zens or taxpayers. It has always been
his desire to make his gifts complete
whenever possible, so that no aid will
be necessary in the future to carry out
his plans. In his hospital for con
sumptives Mr. Phipps reaches the
largest class of invalids in the world,
invalids who can be helped back to
health and strength under proper con
ditions, and whose ailment grows
rapidly worse under the handicap of
improper surroundings. Physicians
convinced Mr. Phipps that a large per
centage of the deaths from tuberculosis
is the result of a lack of sunshine and
pure air, and he immediately sought a
remedy. The donation to build and
equip a perfectly appointed hospital
followed. Undoubtedly hundreds of
people owe their lives to this institution,
and hundreds of others will be added
to the roll of beneficiaries as the years
pass. Then, too. the scientific study
of tuberculosis provided for by him will
result in the dissemination of a knowl
edge of the disease which will reach
every part of the world.
Finally comes the attempt of Mr.
Phipps to help the tenement dwellers
of New York. It is but another effort
to help those who are unable to help
rHvorce Is the sanctioning of this dis
order and the more divorces granted
the more disorder in society is felt.
No matter how many creeds or na
tions may sanction this disorder of di
vorce, they shair not alter the divine
economy â that prescribes to all men of
all creeds or no creeds, "Whoever mar
ries the divorced person commltteth
adultery. (St. Mat. v:32.) And the rea
son of this is another saying, "What
God hath Joined together let no man
put asunder."
Any man who will take into consid
eration these and other similar sen
tences of the Old and the New Testa
ment, which come from God. will draw
the natural and logical conclu
sion that the marriage tie is
indissoluble. Once properly and
validly knotted before God and
man, then there is no power on earth,
c ivil or religious, the Pope of Rome in
cluded, entitled or empowered to dis
solve or put asunder what Gad has
joined together. Consequently a second
marriage for the divorced is a legal
polygamy, indorsed and condemned by
the United States laws.
But what shall be done when two
are mismated and unfitted according to
the natural law, and it is morally, if
not physically, impossible to live to
gether?
According to the Old and the
New Testament, in cases of this
kind a total or partial sepa
ration may be granted, but with no
prospect in future to marry any other
person while one of the two
divorced persons lives. If this
was the general ruling, then in
very many cases they would never
think about divorce; they would make
themselves, an effort to give the very
poor an environment of cleanliness and
comfort at the lowest possible cost- The
proposed model tenements are. not In
tended /or those who are accustomed
to comfortable quarters, but it is the
aim of the donor and his associates to
reach down into the very dregs of so
ciety and drag to a little higher plane
those who are tied down to their pres
ent level by poverty and illness. Mr.
Phipps would help the helplessâ the un
thrifty and shiftless if you likeâ ami
by putting them upon a morÂ« solid
footing hopes to see them later become
able to help themselves. : ;~ ,
Close friends of Mr. Phipps say that
not half of his charities are known.
His attempts at secrecy that have fail
ed are evidence that there are secrets
that have been kept. When a gift from
Mr. Phipps is announced it Is because
there is some object to be attained by
publicity. In 1890 hÂ© announced a gitx.
of $20,000 to the Carnegie Library in
Allegheny for the purchase of books.
It was one of the few gifts in which
he has made conditions, but these con
ditions, he believed, required publicity.
IV to that .time the Carnegie Library
was closed on yundays, and Mr. Phipps
believed that it should be ayaa during
certain hours at least. Be IkatafaN
offered the library board |BO,Otto, with
the stipulation that the reading rooms
be open from noon until S p. m.
INTEREST IN LIBRARIES.
"There are so many worse places for
young men to spend Sunday that the
library doors should stand invUingly
open," he explained. ''There are thou
sands of young men In Allegheny who
live in furnished rooms. They have
few comforts and fewer pleasures. To
them Sunday is a holiday, and they go
out seeking places of amusement. Why
is not the library reading room a good
place for them to spend a few hours?
In my opinion it will prove a preven
tive of much mischief."
His argument prevailed and th* li
brary was ordered kept open en Sun
day, and Mr. Phipps gladly wrote a
check for the stipulated amount.
Mr. Phipps is of the best type of suc
cessful Americans. He was given noth
ing hut a strong character, good health,
honesty and a willingness to work ojjt
his own destiny. His father was a shoe
maker and poor. He could give hl-noh I
no education, but that the son gained!
for himself, largely after he had be
come a business man. In lat<Â» years he
has traveled much, and he to-day
knows the world and its needs as few
book taught men can ever know.
Mr. Phipps has since 1900 been a resi
dent of New York City, and his new
home, now being built, on the corner
of Fifth avenue and Eighty-seventh,
street, will be when finished one of the
handsomest houses in America. The
cost of construction alone will approxi
mate $1,000,000. It is in the Italian
renaissance style of architecture, and
is set on a plat of ground that fronts
100 feet on the avenue and 175 Ist
the street. The house itself, which is
of white Vermont marble, covers *2x
120 feet of the plat, with an extension
or conservatory 40x25 feet, known as an
'Vrangerie,' also built of white Ver
mont marble. For the furnishing of
this superb house the fittings and fur
niture of an Indian palace were bought
outright by Mr. Phipps during a so
journ in India several years ago.

FAMOUS EIGHTEENTH INFANTRY RETURNS FROM
THE PHILIPPINES ON THE TRANSPORT LOCAN

Barkentine J. Smith
Runs Ashore at
San Diego.
The army transport Logan, Captain
Stinson, arrived yesterday from the
Philippines, bringing home the famous
Eighteenth Infantry, Colonel Charles B.
Hall in command. The Eighteenth has
now completed Its second term of serv
ice in the Far East. After resting
here tor a few days it will proceed to
Fort l^euvenworth.
The Logan encountered heavy weath-
tning up irom Honolulu. The pas-
fcc users say it was terrific. Captain
1 Stinson^ to hose wind-burned face the
i iJiii- seniors puist for confirmation of
iheir Btory. says it was merely breezy,
jus 1 a iittlc inter freshness. No dam-
aoi; was done, however, and the troop-
I ;â  reached port some hours earlier than
the transport officials here expected.
ilio Logan made &ocd* time between
.Manila ar.d Nagasaki and surprised
even her own officers by reaching
Honolulu in a day less time than she
has. ever nude before.
In addition to a large number of
cabin passengers the Logan brought
II urn 'Manila Ml enlisted men of the
Eighteenth Infantry, Â£20 casuals; 2 in-
Baoe soldiers, left at Honolulu; -Â» en
listed men, United States Navy and
Marine Corps;- 51 civilians, 20 dis
ciiarfeed soldiers and 2.2 general pris
u:.<is. tShe brought 23 discharged
soldiers and one civilian from Nagasaki
u.rA from Honolulu she brought S en
listed men, 5 discharged soldiers, 6 ma
rines and 1 enlisted man of the rev
enue cutter service. The Logan brought
home a large number of soldier dead.
The Eighteenth Infantry has a long
and honorable record. The regiment
was organized in the war of 1512 and
luusiu throughout the struggle with
England. After that war the Eight
eenth was mustered out of the serv
ice, but the regiment was revived when
Lincoln called for troops and the regu
lar army was enlarged. Through the
civil war and in many Indian cam
paigns the Eighteenth distinguished it
self and won glory during the Spanish
war. The regimental battle flag is one of
the army's most valued relics. Its stripes
arc hidden under the embroidered
names of fights in which it has been
carried and the silken banner is thread
bare and ragged. When the regiment
reaches Fort Leavenworth the nag will
be carefully laid away with the regi-
treasures and its place taken by
a new erne. The new flag will bear no
in^nits of battles on its surface. In ac
ccrdance with a new regulation, the
names of the battles in which the regi
ment has participated will be engraved
on rn^-tal rings, riveted around the flag

WIFE'S NAGGING
DISTURBS REST
Husband Seeks Relief From
His Better Haifa Cruelty
by Applying for Divorce
CALLS FAMILY MEETING
Mrs. Sliadburne Is Said to
Have Summoned Relatives
to Discuss Domestic Woe
"Sleepless nights and days of tor
ture" are part of the misery Wade
Hampton Shadburne says he has suf- t
lered from the "whining and nagging'
of his wife and her "system of vitu- i
.peration and abuse." He sues for dl- â 
vorce on the ground of cruelty. They
were married at Alameda In January, j
ISO 3, and he declares he has had lit
tle peace since. He says that on March
1C last she called "a family meeting of
her mother, stepfather, herself and
others" and that "in tumultuous and
tempestuous manner and In loud tones
and threatening voice" they accused
him of Illicit relations with other wom
en. After this he left home for a week.
When he returned his wife locked him
out of hia room. He avers that she
holds his clothes, music and a valuable
violin, and that In order to humiliate
him on February 6 she caused his ar
rest for alleged 'failure to contribute to
the support of their infant child. At
that time, he says, she caused the pub
lication of certain libelous matter re
garding his relations with other
women.
Alice Louisa Ricklifs, who married
Henry H. Ricklifs in Sonoma County
in 1875 and deserted him in 1886 be
cause of his cruelty and neglect, sued
yesterday for divorce. She says that
her husband owns 52000 worth of Santa
Rosa Bank shares and realty valued at
$1500.
The termination of another long
union is sought by Ivor W. Lloyd in
a suit against Ann Lioyd. They were
married in 1874, and he left her nine
years ago on account of her habitual
intemperance, which, he says, covered
a period of fifteen years.
A pair of twelve-Inch tailor's shears, ;
brandished by Barnett Levinsky,
with an accompaniment of vile oaths
and threats to kill, frightened his wife,
Beckie, into a fainting fit. and she
has sued him for divorce for that and
other cruelties. She says they were
married on October 3 last, and his
abuse began three days later. He had
a habit, she adds, of announcing,
while she was preparing: the evening
meals, that he "was going to die right
off and she would be finished too."
Orlando K. Fitzsimmons has sued
Mary Fitzsimnions for divorce on the
ground of cruelty. Suit for separation
was begun by Minnie Kleiner against
John Kleiner for cruelty, and by
Georgia E. Joyce against Melone
Joyce.
Judge Graham granted a divorce to
Hannah Crane from Thomas Crane,
whom she married in Auckland, New
Zealand, fifteen years ago. He refused
to support her. and for a time she re
ceived maintenance under the Austra
lian "destitute persons act."
RAIDS OX BACON PLACE
HAVE BEEN DISCONTINUED
President Polieim of the Board of Po-
ltce Commissioners Wants War
rants Sworn Out in Future.
The raids on women occupying the
houses on Bacon place, which have
been made three or four times daily
for some weeks, were stopped yester
day by order of Chief of Police Witt
man, acting under instructions from
President Poheim of the Board of Po
lice Commissioners. The Chief said
yesterday that the calendars of the
Police courts were being congested
with these cases and the Judges were
objecting, as jury trials have been de
manded in each case and when a case
has been tried there had always been
an acquittal.
In view of the injunction in regard
to Belden place and 620 Jackson
street issued by Judge Hebbard and
the damage suit for $10,000 instituted
against the Chief, Police Board and
members of the Grand Jury, President
Poheim has come to the conclusion
that those members of the Grand Jury
who were insisting upon the raids on
Bacon ulace must in future swear out
warrants for the arrest of the women
and policemen would then serve them.
Two officers had been engaged in do
ing nothing else but making these
raids.

MELBA SINGS
WITH ALL HER
OLD SPLENDOR
The "Hamlet" "mad scene" yester
day afternoon found all but the old
Meiba in its singing, the magnificent â
almost insolent â security of technique,
the perfect liquidity and roundness of
tone, and a dramatic verve that gave
fine lie to the legend of Melba"s cold
mss â or, just as well, seemed to. It
Iot" the audience, as nothing else
â¢ sang the other night got. them â
turally, as she sang nothing the
other night in like fashion. And then,
with a tiny ballad of a brown-eyed
child that died, Melba set the house
sobbing. With her kind of voice, that
sets one a-thrill by its mere fiber, it is
perhaps not so much of a trick, hut
Melba had all the point lace and lawn
out yesterday afternoon. The house
was full of it, by the way; the usual
crowded "Melba" house. â¢
First came Haendel's "Sweet Bird."
â¢with Mr. North playing a finished and
most sensitively sympathetic flute
obligato. For the same in the "Lucia"
"mad scene" of the other night I
here acknowledge tardy gratitude.
Its bes^ of technical larking, voice
fluting and flute singing the mad little
melodies of thrushes in spring, was
given for all It Is worth. One likes
Mr. Haendel better in other things,
but when one gets him here this way
one forgets the rest. A charming lit
tJÂ» serenade, with harp accompani
ment, was Bung as encore, Signorina
Sassoli showing herself as gifted in ac
companiment as she is -in solo work.
Arditi's "Se Saran Rose" was the third
of the diva's numbers and remarkable
among its limpid pyrotechnics for the
wonderful staccato. It is all tone, be
gun and ended in its smallest spark of
sound as purely as the moat sustained
notes. And then as encore Melba sang
the Tosti "Good-by," that, had it not
been for the "Hamlet," would have
been the event of the* afternoon. Here,
as in the "mad scene," one felt a
splendid satisfaction in the voice's
rich answer to the dramatic demand,
the ripe fullness of the climacteric
note. They would have had the singer
out again and yet again, and poor Mr.
Steindorff's "Rakoczy March" on the
orchestra served only as accompani
ment to the chattering enthusiasm!
Mr. Gilibert, who seemed to have
caught a little cold since Tuesday,
again furnished some exquisite song
singing. He gave the Rubinstein "Le
Reve dv Prisonnler" and as encore
"Plaisir d* Amour" â a delightful bit of
artistry; Tosti's "Chanson I' Adieu" and
Louise's "Petit Noel." Miss Sassoli
again charmed by her admirable harp
playing. Among the numbers was the
Bach B minor "Gavotte," that lends
itself delightfully to the harp, and
was played with classic distinction by
the harpist. Mr. Van Hoose developed
very pleasantly in an artistic reading
of the Walther "Prize Song" and was
encored effusively.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
The Little Women's Club, a charita
ble organization with sewing schools at
1208 Welsh street and 1314 Natoma
street, gave an entertainment Friday
night at 1310 Polk street for the purpose
of raiwinK funds with which to take
their youthful charges to the country
for a month during the summer.

MEN
SB. O. C. JOSItXBT.
The leading
SPECIALIST
MODERN MEDICAL PRACTICE
demands more than a knowledr*
of anatomy, disease' and drugs.
As the science of curing broadens
the greater grows the task of becoming
a master in the profession. ThÂ« sci-
entific application of natural force*
ha* become almost as essential at
medicines, and calls for delicate and
costly equipment as well aa utmost
â¢kill.
My offloe and hospital occupy sixty
rooms and my equipment for the treat-
ment of men's diseases Is the most
complete in the entire West. I lack
nothing that can possibly be helpful
In diagnosing or treating. Everything
from the simplest instrument to thÂ»
most delicate, complicated and costly
electrical apparatus is here to aid me
In rendering to my patients a service
such as no other physician has yet
been able to give.
VARICOCELE
Cured Without Cutting
THE TIME WAS WHEN EVERY
man afflicted with varicocele had
no choice other than allow the
disease to go on undermining his
power and health, or submit to a sur-
gical operation. Now he can choose a
thorough cure by painless treatment. I
cure varicocele in one week, and it is
seldom necessary that the patient be
detained from business even a single
day. My method is original with ray- -
self, and Is the only safe and suc-
cessful treatment for varicocele ever
devised.
CONSULT ME
FREQUENTLY THERE IS A Mis-
apprehension as to the cost of
the services of a competent spec-
ialist. Some sufferers are in-
clined to think that because of the
complete cures I make my fees are
exorbitant. They are not. They a.rÂ«
simply FAIR, and are usually worth
five times what I ask. Before you try
"cheap" treatment It will be to your
interest to consult me. That will cost
you nothing. If you follow this ad-
vlce you will SAVE money. If you
try "cheap" treatment you will
WASTE money: for you willâ ln all
human probability â have to come to
me in the end.
PATIENTS TREATED
PROMPTLY and PRIVATELY
MY SUITE OF TREATING ROOMS
is the largest in the city, which
affords absolute privacy and ob-
viates the annoyance of waiting.
* Z bar* the largest practice
because I invariably fulfill my
promises, and am willing- to wait
for my fee until cure is effected.
I also ' cure Organic Weakness, Con-
tracted Disorders, "Weakness." Spe-
cific Blood Poison. Stricture and all
Diseases of Men.

The title. "Live All Your' Years a
Man." will suggest the interesting in-
formation It bears. Write for it. Con-

CHICAOO. Feb. 11.â Strength in the wheat
market was manifested from the start, open
ing quotations on May being up %@Vic at
$t l<i%@l U%. . July was unchanged to 'â<â¢
higher at $1 00?;@l 00" . The firmness was
due to higher cables and to small receipts in
the Northwest. The main feature of cable
reports wan an advance of l* 4 d at Liverpool.
Thip advance was said, to be the result of
the bullish report on French wheat, the con
.lit inn of the crop being represented .as de
cidedly poor. _ Offerings in the pit were ex
tremely light throughout the . entire day. â¢ In
consequence the volume of ! business was 1 very
small. J'rimaiy receipts to-day were lens than
half the number that arrived the corresp Â«d
lng day a year ago. The decrease on move
ment from farms had to do with an Improved
demand from shorts late In the day. In
pppponse to this buying the market became
strong. May " advancing to $1 17 and. July to
$1 01%.' The strength of corn also had some
influence on traders In the wheat pit. ; The
market closed â¢ almost at the . highest point,

AMERICAN WAYS
Yerkes Demonstrates Afresh
the Value of the Yankee
Methods of Doing Work
ENCOURAGES HIS MEN
Gets More Out of Them in
Tube Enterprises Than
Do the British Employers
Special Pi*r>ateh to The Call.
LONDON, Feb. 11. â Charles T. j
Yerkes. th.- Chicago street railway J
magnate, is demonstrating afresh, by
the smoothness and celerity with
which the various schemes of tube j
construction and electrification of ex- j
isting underground roads under his !
control are being pushed to comple- ;
tion, that an American can get more;
and better work out of British work- !
men than the British employer of la-;
bor. Incidentally, too, he is justifying j
the observation made by one of the !
most influential and authoritative of j
technical journals -in .. England â the |
Engineer â that the ultimate solution r
of England's industrial problems may j
be found in the appointment of expe- â¢
rienced Americans to manage large I
undertakings. j
Of the methods by which Yerkes j
wins the attachment of his employes >
a striking illustration occurred the j
other day. â¢ A young electrical engin- \
eer named Kerrigan met with a fatal I
accident at the big Chelsea electrical J
station. He was the sole support of [
his widowed mother in Ireland. Un ;
der similar circumstances the aver- !
age English company would have paid j
her grudgingly the usual statutory!
compensation. Yerkes sent her a â¢
large check in addition to this sum |
and himself undertook to defray the j
cost of transporting the body to Ire- j
land and the funeral there.
He has proved that the stimulus of I
higher wages is really a measure of 'â 
wise economy. The legion of men en
gaged in the various excavating op- \
erations are paid much more than
they received for similar jobs else- .
where. But with this encouragement I
and under able supervision they put ,
on steam in American fashion and |
perform considerably more than what j
is recognized' as a fair day's labor i
here. Accidents, of course, are un- ]
avoidable in work of so dangerous a
character, but Yerkes has reduced
their number to a minimum. While
of necessity he is compelled to leave
many details to his subordinates, he i
insists that any mishap, however ;
slight, shall be brought to his person- :
al attention. When an accident is
found to be the result of a foreman's j
negligence he is immediately dis- j
missed.

PARIS, Feb. â El Mokri. the
Sultan of Morocco's Minister of Fin
ance, who is at present on a mission to
Paris, has created a sensation in a big
dressmaking establishment by pur
chasing 1 sixty dressing: gowns and one
hundred bath robes. Besides .these
garments El Mokri has ordered two
dozen dinner gowns and about fifty
house dresses. These toilets are in
tended for the use of the women of the

FAIRYLAND GLADDENS
THE LONDON POOR.
Society Formed to Introduce
Sunshine Into Life in Slums
ENTERTJIJi'MEXTS FOR THE CHTLDREX
MAN \\l.i< L.~ AT VIIE 11KAD OF THJ-J NEW MOVEMENT IN LONDON TO TAKE
KAIRVLAND INTO THE SLIMS OF THE CITT, AND ONE OP THE COM
PANIES OF ENTERTAINERS.
j LONDON, Feb. â To spread
J abroad the lore of the fairies; to lighten
with the sunshine of romance- the
J dreary lives of the children of ~ slum
| land, is the aim of a unique society
j which has just been started here.'. The
success which has attended its initial
efforts, and the keen joy with which its
>: performances are received by the little
: folk whose lives are passed for the
' most part amid scenes of sordid squalor
.1 shaw that there is great need of its
: work. And the fact that similar con
| ditions exist in all the big American
; cities which might by similar, methods
! be rendered less dreary to the childish
I victims of poverty may render a dc
| scription of this novel jj association .of
| interest to American readers. â  'â â :''.
j It is called the "Fairy Tale Society,"
and its < entertainments . are ,;, given
j gratuitously to assemblies of poor chil- *;
j dren in various parts of the city. They
I require no elaborate^ preparations V or
j scenic appliances, and necessitate small
: expenditure of money.' Their influence
; does not cease with them. They, awak
| en the imagination of the little . folk,
I and the books of fairy tales which are
j distributed* among" them â litera
j ture is cheap in these daysâ afford the
means of continuing their explorations
i in the delightful realms of fancy, while
j the remembrance of what they mvÂ«
â¢ seen helps them to give a realistic vis
! ual embodiment to the stories they
read. ~ .V-C-' â â %
j As at . present arranged the enter
j tainments take this form. An Individ*
l ual in plain costume tells briefly to the
I children who have been gathered from
j the slums the story of the Pled, Piper!
; of Hamelln, adding that the piper oc- j
< caslonally revisits the earth, accom* I
! panied by some of the children f rom |
fairyland. He says that the piper hat
promised to pay them a call that night, j
; bringing with him scrme of his falrieV
and to 'tell them some of hi* fairy tÂ«lt#
and sing them some of his song*. Si
; this moment the sound of â¢ pip* -
heard outside the hall. "There hÂ« W."
; exclaims the every -day sort of /#an
â  and vanishes from the vtase tÂ». f.Â«al.

â¢ â¢horns**. The .piper, then . reads - some
iai>y . tales from the golden book which
he has brought with him from Fairy
land. The body of the hall meanwhile
is in semi-darkness, all the light being
concentrated on the stage, which helps
maintain the illusion of the supernat
ural character of the entertainers. The
stories are delivered with excellent, but
not overstrained, elocutionary effect,
and the juvenile auditors listen to them
with that rapturous attention which
children always bestow on such tales
when they hear them for the first time.

Have' You Been?" "Dickory, ; Dickory
Dock," "Hurhpty," ' Dumpty Sat On a

"Here We Go Round the Mulberry
Bush." In the midst of the dancing
â  that accompanies this /, last song a
. make-believe clock \ strikes ','l2, the sig
nal for the Pied Piper and his attend- j
ant sprites to take their departure. The
v I piper 'distributes toys and fairy tale
books to the children, while the , fairies
'. scatter flowers among the .audience.
, Then the piper makes a little speech
arid \ bids them pond-by, promising .to
come again some day if they are good.

PROFIT - TAKING SALES
Day's Trading Lacks Anima
tion as Result of the Holi
day Early in the Week
NEW YORK, Feb. 11.â The interest
in the United States Steel stocks, which
was newly revived yesterday in re
sponse to the activity of the minor steel
stocks, was carried over into the early
dealings to-day. After some heavy
transactions the realizing in all of the
steel stocks outweighed the demand,
and their prices were carried back
ward. Colorado Fuel made the con
spicuous rise in the group, with an ad
vance to 52.
The attendance at the board was
rather thin on account of departures to
anticipate the Monday holiday, and the
trading was lacking in animation. The
selling movement seemed to be to close
up contracts for the holiday. But some
effect on sentiment was produced by
the circulation of reports that informa
tion had been received from Washing
ton of a determination reached by the
President to call an extra session of
Congress for the consideration of the
question of freight rate control unless
some legislation wae secured at the
present session of Congrees.
The first reports of railroad gross
earnings for the first week of February
showed some declines from the South
western region of the country, which
were supposed to be due to the export
grain rate war, and officials of Western
railroads were reported as complaining
that the reduced rates were bringing
little increase in the shipments of
grain.
Prices hardened again during the lat
ter part of the session, apparently on
account of the covering of shorts put
out earlier, and the day's net changes
are unimportant. The closing tone was
irregular. The bank returns, although
weak, were no worse than expected,
and the great ease of the money mar
ket detracts from its sevious considera
tion. The total sales of bonds, par
value, were $3,020,000.
The week's stock market has given
an impression of strength that is not
entirely borne out by a close analysis
erf the price changes, which show a
large proportion of small declines
mixed with striking gains in the active
issues. The deduction to be drawn is
that there has been extensive realizing
under cover of the sustaining effect of
the sudden advances in special stocks.
Movements have been fitful and uneven
and sentiment among operators a good
deal mixed. General conditions have
been good, according to reports from
day to day, and some important devel
opments have been announced, while
the easy and abundant state of credits
has been undisturbed.
The moderate response ' of stock to
these conditions in itself has given oc
casion for question about the future
conditions in the securities market.
Within two weeks past the United
States Steel Corporation has published
its report of earnings for the December
quarter, showing an excess of the most
optimistic previous estimates which
had been used to stimulate the demand
for those securities.

played by one of Mr. Eyre's sons, not
yet too old to have full command of a
good treble voice.
It was an article entitled "Fairy
land and the Slum Child â a Hint to
Philanthropists," by Arthur Rickett,
formerly on the staff of Punch, which
first suggested to him a means of giv
ing practical effect to the desire he
had long cherished. It was a case of
good seed falling on good ground and
bringing forth fruit a hundred-fold.
That article led to a meeting between
Rickett and Eyre and as a result very
shortly thereafter the Fairy Tale So
ciety was started. Wherefore Eyre
modestly declares that whatever credit
attaches to it belongs primarily to
Rickett.
WORK IS IMPORTANT.
Eyre regards the work of the society
as something far more important than
merely providing amusement for the
idle hours of poverty-stricken child
hood. The development of Juvenile
imaginations he regards as a most im
portant feature of educational work
which is these days when utilitarian
ism holds the field, and on every side
is heard the cry that the young should
be taught only so-called "practical
knowledge," is in danger of being sad
ly neglected.
"Happiness," he said, "comes from
within. That was proclaimed ages ago,
but it is a truth which every man has
to learn afresh from experience. And
nothing contributes so much to hap
piness from that source as a cultivated
imagination. The seeds of It should be
sown in the impressionable age of
childhood; otherwise the mind is apt to
become so absorbed in the struggle for
purely materialistic things that there
is no room â no desire â for such de
velopment. And fairy tales, with the
irresistible appeals they make to child
ish fancy, afford the best stimulants for
its early growth. There is many a man
owes his attainment to that blessed
state which finds contentment without
riches to the bent given to his mind by
fairy tales. I have spent four years in
America and I am convinced that the
need of fairy tale societies is as great
thereâ and perhaps greaterâ than in
England."
If the idea should be well received in
America Eyre may make a tour there
next season expounding and illustrating
the aims and methods of the Fairy-
Tale Society.

CONFESSES
Admits He Perjured
Himself to Save
His Son.
Pleads Guilty to Charge
Made by Federal Grand
Jury.
Prominent Oregon Attorney When
Arraigned on Indictment Makes
a Sensational Plea.
PORTLAND. Feb. 11.â The climax
was reached to-day in. the land fraud
cases when Judge Albert H. Tanner,
indict' on February Â£ for the crime of
pej-Jury in regard to the date of a con
tract of copartnership with United
States Senator John H. Mitchell, went
before the Federal court and entered a
plea of guilty. The scene was a dra
matic one. impressive and sorrowful.
Judge Tanner, whose indictment came
as a sudden blow to the public a short
time ago, entered the courtroom hag
gard and worn and bowed as by Â» the
weight of years. With him was hlÂ«
son. to shield whom the plea was made.
Following: both was Harry C. Robert
son, the private secretary of Senator
M it. hell.
When, on January 31. Judge Tanner
went before the jury he told a story
which, cording to his confession to
day, had been agreed upon in. many of
its details when Senator Mitchell was
in Portland in December last. Ho said
that there had â¢ been an agreement
made between himself and the Senator
by which the Senator, was not to re
ceive any return from, firm work done
which would lead him to either of the
departments of the Government and
thai this agreement had been made, on
March 5, 190 L
Thf <;â  vernment was in possession of
nee at that time which varied
iiom Judge Tanners testimony, and,
linking it together. United States Dis
trict Attorney F. J. H> iky was able to
mak^ such a shoving that not only
JudÃ< Tanner, but his son, Albert H.
Tanner Jr.. was indicted by the Grand
Jury. Neither of these indictments was
made publi< .
ADMITS HIS GIILT.
When Judge Tanner had been
â worn to-day Attorney Heney hand
ed him thp contract which hp had
â worn before the Grand Jury was the
original document and asked when
tIM document was written.
"It was in December last." Judge
Tanner replied.
Judge Tanner was asked if the doc
ument was to be used in defense of
United .States Senator Mitchell.
Judge Tanner in reply made the
following statement:
1 will tell you the circumstances
and you can draw your own conclu
sions. When Mr. Mitchell was out
here he looked over the old contract
and there was a clause in it he
thought ought to be changed and he
told me to fix it and I then drew up
the writing here, changing the partic
ular clause that he (Senator Mitchell)
thought would be dangerous for him
and we signed it. At the time that
was don" I said to him: 'Now Mr.
Robertson ip the only man on earth,
except you and I, that knows to the
contrary anything about this agree
ment and Mr. Robertson will have to
corroborate this thing. Of course, it
may get us into trouble.' He said he
would see what he could do with Rob
ertson, or something of that kind, and
the agreement was left with me in
that shape and I have not had any
correspondence or any words with the
Senator about it since he left here."
The new agreement signed In De
cember of last year contained a clause
not included in the original, which
provided that all money received in
payment for services rendered before
Government departments should go to
Tanner. In all other respects the last
agreement was identical with the
original contract.
SOX OX STAND.
Judge Tanner's son. Afbert H. Tan
nei Jr., testified that during Senator
Mitchell? visit in Portland last De
cember he prepared on v typewriter
tht new agreement between his father
and Senator Mitchell, as confessed by
his father.
Judge Tanner made the following
sii^tf-meiit to-day.
"No one knows the torture I have
endured since January 31, wjjen I
made n statement to the Grand Jury
concerning the date of the co-partner
ship agreement between Senator
Uttcbell and myself. Thf last straw
Cf m*. however, when T learned that
th< Federal Grand Jury was prepar
inp to indict my sou, who had writ
ii i. the agreement between Senator
Aliu hell a;.d mysÂ«if on the typewriter,
for perjury, and when I learned that
the agents of the Government were in
possession of facts proving that the
document was not signed March .",

LOS ANGELES, Feb. 11.â Herbert W.
Chittcnden of Los Angeles, manager of
the Mutual American Investment Com
pany, a San Francisco "get-rich-quick"
concern, disappeared to-day. The com
pany has been exposed and many vic
tims of its fraudulent methods began
to press for a settlement, which could
not be made, hence Chittenden's hasty
departure. A half dozen police officers,
including a sergeant, are among the
alleged dupes. Chittenden's wife stated
this evening that she urged him to
leave.
"There was no other way to get the
president of the company, B. Maurice
Rice, to come '.own here from San
Francisco," she said. "For weeks, ever
Fince the company quit paying off con
ttacts, my husband had sat in that of
fice in the Bryson block and borne the
brunt of abuse heaped on the company
by disappointed patrons. Why, they
came there by scores."
Hire claims Chlttenden got hold of
ten lapsed contracts, canceled them on
the books, sold them for their face
value and $100 premium and kept the
latter. Rice declares Chittenden left be
cause he (Rice) came here. The man
who bought the contracts', Attorney
John H. Foley, declares Chittenden is
straight.
President Rice has made a pubHc
statement, which is an out and out

is now seeking to proceed, is finan
cially sound and has been "officially
indorsed and sanctioned by the Post

The Postofflce Department issued a
fraud order throwing the concern's
business out of the mails, which is the
extent of its indorsement.

the land was for their own use, when,
according to the indictment, it was for
the benefit of the firm of Van Gessner

NEW YORK, Feb. 11.â Andrew Car

go to Cleveland to testify against Mrs.
Cassie L. Chadwick, who is under ar
rest in that city, charged with obtain
ing large sums of money on alleged se
curities bearing Carnegie's name. It is
alleged that the signatures were forged.
Carnegie's announcement was made
after a subpena ordering him to appeal
at Cleveland to testify in the Chadwick
case on March 6 had been served upon
him.
In an interview Andrew Carnegie de
nies that Mrs. Chadwick is his daugh
.ter or is in any way related to him
and declares her whole story is a fraud.
He not only will go to Cleveland and
testify, but will urge his financial
agents to do likewise. He says emphat
ically that he never signed a single note
for the woman, never saw her, nor had
he heard of her until she was exposed
in *the newspapers.
The idea of his giving notes to any
body is characterized as "foolish," as
hÂ« always has at least $10,000,000 avail
able for immediate use.
He bewails the fate of Banker Beck

of $800,000 amused Carnegie, but he ex
pressed keen sympathy for him and all

Republican Leaders Criticize
Policy of the Executive.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 11. â The Sen- |
ate in executive session to-day ratified
tht arbitration treaties between the
Lnited States and eight European ;
governments. It required two sessions
to reaqh an agreement. At the first '
session consideration was given to a j
communication from the President to
Stnator Cullom, chairman of the For
eign Affairs Committee, in the form of
a protest against any amendment be
ij.g adopted; at the second session the
ti^aties wer^ amended and ratified,,
with only nine votes against the
amendment made by the Senate Com
mittee on Foreign Relations.
The situation in the Senate over the
arbitration treaties has been strained '
for several weeks. The first protests
against the treaties were made by Sen- (
ators from Southern States, who suk- :
gested an amendment which precluded â 
the possibility of the arbitration of
claims against their States by reason
of repudiated bonds. Later it was sug- â 
gested *hat an amendment should be
adopted which changed but one word,
that of "agreement" to "treaty" in
article 11, making the article read as
fellows:
"In each individual case the high
contracting parties, before appealing
to the permanent court of arbitration,
shall conclude a special treaty defining
clearly the matter in dispute, the scope
of the powers of the arbitrators and
the periods to be fixed for the forma
tion of the arbitration tribunal and
the several stages of the procedure."
The amendment answered the pur
pose of the protests made by the
Southern Senators and In addition to
that established the principle that any
matter in the nature of a treaty with
a foreign Government must be con
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
summated by the President "with thÂ«
consent of the Senate." In this form
th-Â» committee reported the treaties to
the Senate.
The first session of the Senate to
day was confined almost entirely to a
defense by half a dozen Senators of
the Senates right to amend treaties.
The President was criticized sharply
because of his letter declaring it to be
a step backward to ratify the tr
in the form proposed by the SenatÂ«
Committee on Foreign Relations.
No defense of the President's position
was taken until the second executive
i session, when Senators Dolliver. Fair
bank?, Platt of Connecticut and Hop
kins argued against the need of haste.
They took the position that there were
no questions included in the treaty
which could not properly be submitted
by executive agreement to arbitration.
Senator Dolltver 9aid that there were
tome matters of business that were
pressing in the Senat â â¢. but that the
treaties did not enter into the list, and
i that if they were amended in the form
imposed the country would have no
further interest in them.
It was argued hf these Senators that
an amendment ought to be directed, if
amendment was necessary at all, to aÂ»
better definition >>t tfcs class of ques
tions to be left to arbitration, rather
than by an amendment which put th<Â»
Government of thf Tnited Sates in th-
attitude of agreeing with foreign coun
tries in advance that in certain cases
it would make treaties of arbitration.
It was said the obligation to do that
was already put upon us by Th* Hague
convention and the oft-repeated state
ment that It is the national poti'

THE VALUE OF CHARCOAL.
Feu- People Know How Useful It Is in
Preserving Health and Beauty.
Nearly everybody knows that char-
coal is the safest and most efficient
disinfectant . nd purifier in nature, but
few realize its value -when taken Into
the human system for the same cleans-
ing purpose.
Charcoal is a remedy that the more
you take of it the better; it is not a
drug at all, but simply absorbs the
gases and impurities always present in
the stomach and intestines and carries
them out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after
smoking, drinking or after eating
onions and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and im-
proves the complexion, it whitens the
teeth and further acts as a natural
and eminently safe cathartic
It absorbs the injurious gases which
collect In the stomach. and bowels; it
disinfects the mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh.
All druggists sell charcoal in one
form or another, but probably the best
charcoal and the most for the money
is In Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges; they
are composed of the finest powdered
"Willow charcoal and other harmless
antiseptics in tablet form, or rather in
the form of - large, pleasant tasting
lozenges, the charcoal being mixed
with honey.
The. daily use of these lozenges will
coon tell in a much improved cor.di-
tion of the general health, better com-
plexion, sweeter breath and purer
bjcod, and the beauty of it is that no
possible harm can result from their
continued use, but, on the contrary,
great benefit. â¢ .
A Buffalo physician, in speaking of
the benefits of charcoal, says; "I ad-
vise Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges to all
patients suffering from gas in stomach
and bowels, and to clear the complex-
ion and purify the breath, mouth and
throat; I also believe the liver is great-
ly benefited by the daily use of them;
they cost but twenty-five cents a box at
drug stores, and, although in some
sense a patent preparation, yet I be-
dieve I get more and better charcoal in
Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges than in
any of the ordinary charcoal tablets."

treaties, it was argued, offered to this
Government the best chance it was
likely to have in this generation to do
Its phare toward the abolition of the
barbarisms of war.
After the speeches by Senators Platt
of Connecticut, Dolliver and Fairbanks
a motion to adjourn was made on the
ground that there was no need for
h;:sty action on the treaties. Those who
favored the amendment opposed this
motion and on a roll call it was de
feated.
A motion was then made to adopt the
committee's amendment. The vote was
then taken on the treaty between the
I'nied States and France, as the other
ireaties are on identical lines. The roll
was called and the amendment was
adopted by a vote of 50 to 9. When this
amendment was adopted it was agreed
to as far as the other treaties were
concerned, and the treaties were rati
lied by a viva vooe vote. The Senate
*.hen, at' 6:20 p. m.. adjourned.
The President's letter to Senator Cul- ]
' lorn was as follows:
"The White House, Washington, t>.
< "., Feb. 10, 15)05.-â My Dear Senator Oul
iom: I learn that the Senate Commit
tee on Foreign Relations has reported
I the arbitration treaties to the Senate,
..amending them by substituting for the
vord 'agreement' in the second article
the word treat The effect of the
amendment is to make it no longer pos
sible, as between its contracting, par
ties, to submit any matter whatever. to
arbitration without first obtaining a
special treaty to cover the cate. This
will represent not a step forward, but
a steo backward. If the word â agree
. merit' were retained it would be pos
, sible for the Department of State to
do as, for instance, it ha 3 already done
under The Hague treaty in the pious
. fund arbitration case with Mexico, and
submit to arbitration such subordinate
matters as by treaty the Senate had
decided could be left to the- executive
to submit under a jurisdiction limited
by the general treaty of arbitration.
If the word 'treaty' be substituted the
I result is* that every such agreement
j must be submitted to the Senate; and
' these general arbitration treaties
would then cease to be such, and, in
deed, in their amended form they
1 amount to a specific pronouncement
against the "whole principle of a gen
eral arbitration treaty.
"The Senate has, of course, the ab
solute right to reject or an.end in any
way it sees nt any treaty laid before
it, and it is clearly the duty of the
. Senate to take any step which, in the
i exercise of its Â«>esc judgment, it deems
! to be for the interest of the nation. If,
: however, in the judgment of the Pres
ident, a given amendment nullifies a
, proposed treaty, it seems to me that it
jis no less clearly his duty to refrain
from endeavoring to secure a ratilica
tion by the other contracting power or
powers of the amended treaty: and
after much thought I have come to the
COMChiefOfl tliat I ought to write and
tell you that Mioh is my Judgment in
this case.
"As amended, we would have a
treaty of arbitration which in effect
will do nothing but to recite that this
Government will, when it Jeems it
wise, hereafter enter into treaties of
arbitration. Inasmuch as we, of
course, now have the power to enter
into any treaties of arbiration and in
asmuch as to pass those amended
treaties does not in the smallest de
gree facilitate settlements by arbi
tration, to make them would n no
way further the cause of international
peace.
"It would not. in my judgment, be
wise or expedient to try to secure the
assent of the other contracting pow
ers to the amended treaty, for even if
such assent were secured we should
still remain precisely where we were
before, save where the situation may
be changed a little for the worse.
There would n Â°t even be the slight
benefit that might obtain from the
more general statement that we in
tend hereafter, when we can come to
an agreement with foreign powers as
to what shall be submitted, to enter
into arbitration treaties: for we have
already, when we ratified The Hague
treaty with the various signatories,
solemnly declared such to be our in
tention; and nothing is gained by re
iterating our adherence to the prin
ciple while refusing to provide any
means of making our intention ef
fective. In the amended form the
treaties contain nothing except such
expression of barren intention; and,
indeed, as compared with what has
already been provided for in The
Hague arbitration treaty, they proba
bly represent not a step forward, but
a slight step backward as regards the
question of international arbitration.
As such I do not think that they
would receive the sanction of this
, Government. j
'Personally, it is not my opinion
that this Government lacks the pow
er to enter into general treaties of ar
bitration, but if I am in error and if
this Government has no power to en
ter into such general treaties, then it
seems to me that it is better not to

'THEODORE ROOSEVELT."
"Hon. S. M. Cullom, chairman. Com
mittee on Foreign Relations, United
States Senate."
The letter was something of a sur
prise to many members of the Senate
and the reading received the undivided
attention of all present. When the-read
ing hdcl been concluded Senator Mor
gan took the floor and, making the
President's letter the text of his re
marks, proceeded with a sharp criti
cism of executive interference with the
Senate in performing its part in the
making of treaties.
Morgan spoke of the letter as another
evidence of the President's tendency
toward the usurpation of the Senato
rial prerogatives and said that the
President had no more right to inter
fere with the Senate's consideration of
the subject at this stage of the proceed
ing than the Senate would have had to
interfere with him while the treaty was
in process of preparation.
When Senator Morgan completed his ;
speech Senator Spooner took the floor, ;
and, following somewhat on the lines
of Morgan's remarks, took issue with .
the President on the substitution of the
word "treaty" for "agreement," con
tending that the change was not an in
dication of any backward step, but that
even with this change the consumma
tion of the treaties wou.ld mark an im
portant step forward. He said that
the ratification of the treaty, as amend
ed by the committee, would pledge the
Government to the general proposition
of arbitration. He also made a strong
contention for the preservation of the
Senatorial prerogative, and, instancing
the agreement with reference to the
pious fund, declared that even that
should have been presented to the Sen
ate, notwithstanding the general provi
sion for submission to The Hague tri
bunal.
Senator Lodge followed with the ar
gument that it was for the Senate to
determine its amendments according to
the constitution and insist on all of its
prerogatives. He spoke of his personal
relations to the President, and said that
it was hard for him to take a position
so directly contrary to the view of the
President. He declared that he was
sure the President was not willfully try
ing to usurp the power of the Senate or
to gather to himself any powers other
than those which constitutionally be
longed to the executive, and that the
differences were confined to phraseology
in the treaties. The most honorable
motives were ascribed to the President
by Senator Lodge, and Senators who
followed expressed the highest regard
for the President.
The President's letter was discussed
also by Senator Foraker, who was em
phatic in his assertion that the Senate
was in duty bound to maintain its posi
tion in this matter, if only to prevent
the establishment of a dangerous pre- ,
cedent.
Several Senators took exception to the
statements made by Senators Platt of
Connecticut and Fairbanks that the
words "treaty" and "agreement" as
used in the original treaty and the pro
posed amendment were synonymous
and that there could be no reason for
the adoption of the amendment.
SIGNS OF LIFE
IN ALVISO TOWN
Citizens, After Half a Cen
tury, Prepare to Take Ad
vantage of Their Rights
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 11.â After a Rip Van
Winkle existence of more than fifty
years, the people of the town of Alviso
have decided to avail themselves of the
act of incorporation granted them by
the Legislature in 1852. At that time
Alviso was one of the flourishing towns
of Santa Clara Valley, with great pros
pects in view. The incorporation act
provided that the citizens were to hold
an election on the first Monday in May
of each year. There is no record of
such an election. The only record in
existence is the passage of a legislative
act in 1862 granting the Board of Trus
tees of the town of Alviso the right to
convey certain lands within the cor
porate limits of the town. None of the
old residents of the place has any re
membrance of a town government.
Tfle act of incorporation provided for
a board of five Trustees and gave the
board the privilege of levying a wharf
age tax on vessels and to levy a tax of
25 cents on each $100 valuation of prop
erty for the support of the town gov
ernment. The incorporate limits of Al
viso include some 10,000 acres and ex
tend from the present town site to the
bay waters.
Within the last few weeks there has
been a boom in the affairs of Alviso
and the people of that burg have de
cided to avail themselves of the advan
tages of incorporation. Meetings have
been held and the matter discussed.
Attorneys Oneal and Richardson of
San Jose have been consulted and they
have advised the citizens that the in- j
corporated town still exists. At a meet- \
ing of the Alviso Improvement Club
last Wednesday night the following of
ficers were appointed to look after the
town's affairs and to arrange for the
regular election in May: Trusteesâ W. i
F. Robidoux, P. B. Martin, James A.
Shields, John M. Lords and John J. ,
Ortley Jr.; Treasurer, William Ortley;
Marshal, F. O. Oakes; Assessor, Miles
Hollister.
For several years the saloonkeepers
of Alviso have refused to pay any
license to the county, alleging that the
incorporation of the town stopped the
county from the collection of such tax.

Their married life was a happy one
until her husband's death on October
8, 1878. During many years of strug
gle and vicissitudes In the rough
mountain country Mrs. Colton was
ever at her husband's side, and none
was prouder than she when, for an
act of courage, the northern Sheriff,
her husband, was made a general of
the State militia by Governor Bigler.
During the days of political struggle
and in the face of a heart-breaking
campaign she was his counselor and
his comfort in time of defeat. And
afterward when success crowned his
business ventures she w\ts a happy
sharer in his good fortune. As owner
of the Amador mine and the Rocky
Mountain Coal Company General Col
ton was one of the organizers and
builders of the Central Pacific Rail
road, and it was from that company
that the Central Pacific drew its sup
ply of fuel.
A year after her husband's death
Mrs. Colton brought suit for an ac
counting against Senator Stanford,
who was the controlling factor in sev
eral other large companies that were
interested in the construction of the
Central Pacific. The trial, occupying
several months, took place in Santa
Rosa before Judge Temple and re
sulted in a compromise for the widow.
Shortly thereafter Mrs. Colton re
moved to Washington with her two
daughters.

ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 11. â
There is not the slightest truth in the
report printed in the London Dally

act of the new Minister of the Interior,
Bouligan, on arriving in St. Peters

idence of Witte, president of the Com

SABBATH DAWNS IN ST. PETERSBURG
WITH NO PROSPECT OF RIOTING.
STRIKE DISTURBANCES NOW CONFINED
TO RUSSIAN POLAND AND CAUCASUS
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 12.â St. Pe
tersburg breathed easier this morning,
the apprehensions of a general resump
tion of the strike having proved unjus
tified, at least as far as yesterday is
concerned, and the strikers having
manifested no inclination to resort to
measures in the nature of the events of
January 22.
Dispatches from all parts of the em
pire show a distinct improvement In
the industrial situation, except in Po
land and the Caucasus, and the great
tidal wave of economic disturbance
which swept over the entire land as a
sequence to the historic upheaval in St.
Petersburg in January is now believed
to be on the ebb. Remnants of this
general strike movement still exist in
many quarters in Russia and the Rus
sian industrial classes are so far from
being contented that a reissuance of
the wave cannot be omitted from fu
ture calculation, but for the time being
the economic peril which threatened to
shake the political structure and ronder
armies utterly impotent seems to be
abating.
Jn Poland and the Caucasus regions.
Indeed, the strike continues in full
vigor, th% week bringing bloody colli
sions between strikers and troops at
Sosnorice and ending in a full resump
tion of the walkout at Warsaw. But
these sections have peculiar industrial
conditions differing from the rest of
the empire. Baku, Batoun, Tiflis and
other cities of the Caucasus are chronic
strike breeders, and the problem in Po
land is complicated by the large mass
of strikers and those made idle on ac
count of the depression caused by the
war.
The St. Petersburg strike had not
diminished yesterday, but neither had
it greatly increased. The industrial
quarters southeast of the city, in
which are located the Putiloff Iron
Works and the St. Petersburg Car
Works, are largely idle and the men
of two establishments in the Viborg
quarter and of one in Vassiliostroff
joined the strike, but employes in gen
eral finished the week without quit
ting, giving employers further time to
agree on concessions. Measures taken
by the authorities to prevent proselyt
ing in force by strikers were entirely
effective and the offer of certain con
ctssions by the Putiloff Iron Works
also had its effe*ct on the temper of
the workmen.
There will be no demonstration to- !
day unless it is a spontaneous one, j
the strikers having no plans for such I
a demonstration as they had on the '
eve of the slaughter of January 22 and '
in the absence of plans for concerted
action the force of police and mili- i
tary seems ample to preserve order. '

DID YOU EVER
FIND MONEY?
Maybe not â wouldn't be yours to keep if you did, and yet if some one were to tell you
of a place where fabulous treasure was buried and where, by very little exertion on your part, a
share of that wonderful treasure would honestly and legitimately be yours, how quickly you would
seize the opportunity and take the necessary steps to obtain it. We stand in just such a position
towards you to-day. We know where fabulous wealth" is hidden. We are the fiscal agents of the
men who are getting it out and we can and willâ if you will only let usâ put you upon the right
road of obtaining your legitimate share.
It is gold ore of which we speak â ore in countless tons in Mt. Whitney, Inyo County, Cali-
fornia. 1 The ; advent and improvement of modern machinery into this inexhaustible treasure field
has made it not only possible but practically certain that "the days of old, the days of gold, the
days of forty-nine," , will be surpassed:
Development work, which is now going on night and day with two shifts of men, has ex-
posed veins of surpassing â assays of which show values as" high as $250.00 per ton.
The Mt. Whitney "Gold Mining Co., which owns the great Spear group of mines, is pushing
this development work with all possible speed. It owns the properties free from all incumbrance,
has its own assay office, blacksmith shops, tracks, ore cars and mining equipment; hence you can
easily see that this proposition is not a "maybe" or a "has been," but is an "izzer"â as the old
Missouri farmer used to say. ' . s v< ; V
; A few weeks ago stock in this mine was ten cents a share it is- now fifteen cents, at which
1 price a limited number of shares will be sold to prosecute further development work.
The moment the mills are installed and begin working prices will again advance,, and as
soon as the stock reaches a dividend-paying basis you won't be able to buy a share for love nor
money. â¢ . - ...
. As proof of the vast fortunes which have been â from properties whose prospects,
were, at the |tart, not nearly so good as Mt. Whitney's â we cite the following facts:

Philadelphia bought stock in a Tonopah company for five cents a share; he invested

:onvinced that the troops will obey
orders, there is little prospect of gen
eral disorder.
The Narva quarter, for example, is
everywhere strongly picketed and a
bugle signal will concentrate six com
panies at a given point in a few min
utes. Like arrangements have been
made in other manufacturing sections
and an adequate force is on hand to
preserve order in the center of the
city.
The employers have not arrived at a
decision for joint action in making
concessions to the strikers, and many
of them, tiring of the dilatoriness of
the others, are already attempting to
satisfy the men on their own account.
fATORS A LAND CONGRESS.
Czar's Important Statement to the
Son of Count Tolstoi.
ST. PETERSBURG. Feb. 11.â "I am
not opposed to a Zemskyzabur. On the
contrary, I believe it necessary."
In these words Emperor Nicholas,
whose mind is law. personally declared
himself in favor of a land congress and
expressed the conviction that the time
had come to prepare to give the people
a voice in the Government.
The Emperor's words' were spoken in j
the course of a conversation with
Count Leo Donivitch Tolstoi, son of the
famous author, and fully confirm the
press interview with Grand Duke
Vladimir on January 31, in which the
Grand Duke Vladimir expressly de- |
clared that his august nephew was in :
favor of a Zemskyzabor. The semi
official denials subsequently sent out
are now disproved by the sovereign's
statement to Count Tolstoi.
GREAT ARMY OF STRIKERS.
One Hundred Thousand Men Idle in
the Vicinity of Lodz.
LODZ. Poland, Feb. 11. â The fif
teenth day of the strike finds the
situation here apparently no clearer
than the day on which the movement
began. The condition of affairs
briefly is: There are 100,000 strikers
in Lodz and its vicinity and the strik
ers demand an eight-hour day with
pay at the rate of 20 kopecks (10
cents) an hour, which is between three
and four times the present rate of
1 ay. These demands, which are con
sidered extravagant, added to the fact
that the liberal concessions granted
by the employers have not been ac
cepted, are taken as proof that the
strike is a political rather than a labor
movement. Manufacturers offer a ten
hour day with an increase of from 5 to
15 per cent in wages and also agree to
reduce rents for workmen's dwellings.
They issued an ultimatum this morn
ing that unless the strikers accept
their terms and return to work Mon
day the mills will be closed indefi
nitely.
The personal relations between the
masters and men are of the friendliest,
the masters believing that the strike ia
due to outside influences. The Gov
ernor of Lodz said to-day:
"The manufacturers have made
every concession possible. Some of
them wanted to continue to pay the
strikers, but we have now forbidden
this.
"My official reports from Sosnovic*,"
he continued, "show thirty-three per
sons were killed and thirty-six wound
ed, eighteen seriously, in the conflict
at the Katherinen Iron Works. Thurs
day. The trouble began when a large
body of striking miners tried to force
the furnace men of the iron works t>
put out the fires and join the strikers.
The mob became violent, broke down
] a fence and forced an entrance into the
I works, which Â«Â«i pnviti by two
i companies of infantry. The officers Â«>r-

The Governor added that no other

' quiet had been restored In the ctty.
There are SO.iHm) rn^n on strike in the

THE SAX FKANCtSGO CALL, SUXDAY. i-EBKUAKV 12, 1903.
RAILROADS
PROJECTED
IN ALASKA
Two Companies Place Their
Plans Before Congress in
the Hope That Federal
Aid May Be Forthcoming
TO OPEN IT IUCH
PAKT OF COUNTRY
Senator Dietrich Devises a
Scheme Providing- for a
Complete Change in the
Territory's Government
WASHINGTON, Feb. 11.â Railroad
builders or men who say th*Â»y intend
to be railroad builders in Alaska are
thick upon Congress this winter. Those
who have already secured rights want
them extended one way or ano-ther,
chiefly in the matter of time. Two new
bills have been introduced to charter
companies that propose, should the bills
pass, to build standard gauge roads
frftm points on the coast c-f the Gulf of
Alaska, one heading from Valdez and
the other from a point some distance
south of Valdez across the mountain
range to Eagle City on the Yukon.
Both ask Congress to guarantee bonds
sufficient, in the estimate of each, to
build the road.
They base their propositions on the
arrangement effected in the Philippines
and the bills will be urged with this
argument, backed with an appeal to
the patriotism of members of Con
gress, who will be asked to take as
much interest in and do as much for
the prospectors and pioneers of the
North, who are laboring to develop a
portion of their own land, fighting
nature in her most grudging and in
hospitable mood, as have done for
the alien Filipino. Congress is about to
build wagon roads in Alaska at an es
timated cost of $1,000,000. The railroad
men say they will furnish the money
and build that which will speed the de
velopment of the territory far beyond
what any mere wagon road will do.
They h#ve the reports of military engi
neers aiding with them as to the com
parative merits vt the two. Represen
tatives of both companies have paved
the way for the bills with an accumu
lation of data concerning the country,
its resources and needs.
The bill incorporating the Alaska
Railroad Company was introduced in
the Senate by Senator Burnham, chair
man of the Committee on Cuban Rela
tions and a member of the Committee
on Territories. The incorporatt.-rs are:
William L. Bull, Grant B. Schley. Wil
liam M. Barnum, Andrew F. Burleigh
of New York, Winthrop Smith, Sabin
W. Colton, W, Frederick Snyder, Wil
liam B. Kurtz of Philadelphia. William
S. McLean, Irving A. Steams of
Wilkesbarre and John Kosene of Seat
tle. The line of their road would cross
the mountains through Mentasta pass
and reach the Yukon by an almost di
rect route. It would not touch Fair
banks except by a branch. It would
tap vast coal and copper fields that are
known and that have called out de
tailed reports c-f the Geological survey
and the owners of which, some of
whom are wealthy* corporations, are
calling for a road and are willing to
enter into contract for freight at fig
ures and in quantity that invite in
vestment. â¢
To reach these mines and traverse
great timber areas is the primary pur
pose of the road. The provisions of
the bill require the road to be complet
ed to Eagle within five years, a dis
tance approximately of 500 miles. The
cost is estimated at $30,000 a mile and
the Government is asked to guarantee
bonds on this basis at 4 per cent. The
projectors agree to build to the Kayak
coal fields, 35 miles, this year if the
charter is given. Here is a vein of coal
rated by the geological survey as supe
rior to the Pocahontas steam coal of
West Virginia, and which shows a vein
70 feet from floor to roof and covering
a known field 35 miles in extent. p
The other bill is in behalf of the
Trans-Alaska Railroad Company. The
line here proposed extends from the
town of Valdez to Eagle, with Fair
banks on the main line. The bill is
drawn along substantially the same
lines as the other, the material differ
ence being the figures. The cost of the
road is estimated at $40,000 a mile and
the bond guarantee is asked on that
basis. The limit of time for completing
the road is fixed at eight years. The

WHAT THE MINISTER SAYS
Is Most Convincing.
"1 thought I would write you what
Pyramid Pile Cure has done for me. I
had a most aggravated case of bleed-
ing piles; Indeed I dreaded when I had
to go to stool. One fifty cent box cured
mo. I feel like a new man. I have rec-
ommended it to others as being the
most wonderful remedy known. It is
indeed a great blessing to-suffering hu-
manity. You are at liberty to use this
for all It is worth, and I hope it may do
good."â Rev. W. E. Carr, 355 No. Hol-
brook St., Danville, Va.
Clergymen (like all professional men
\vh<J lead sedentary lives) are especially
addicted to piles in various forms, and
are continually on the lookout for a
remedy which -will give relief, with lit-
tle or no idea of obtaining a cure.
Recognizing this fact. Rev. Mr. Carr
consents to the use of his name in order
that other sufferers may know there is
a cure called Pyramid Pile Cure, which
is sold by druggists everj'whefe for the
low price of fifty cents a package, and
which will bring about for every one
afflicted with piles the same beneficial
results as in his own cage. Be careful
to accept no substitutes, and remem-
ber that there is no remedy "just as
good."
A little book describing the causes
and cure of piles is published by Pyr-
amid Drug Co., Marshall, Mich., and
will be sent free for the asking. All
sufferers are advised to vrriteVtor it, as
it contains valuable information on the
i subject if piles.

roads and trails, the establishment of
schools and the care of insane persons
in Alaska, the work to be done by the
people and with money raised from li
censes and fees. This is deemed one of
the most beneficial of the laws pro
posed by the commission of Senators
that visited Alaska last year. Senator
Dietrich, however, has come forward
with a bill providing a new scheme of
government. It contains a clause re
pealing this road bill. However, Sen
ator Dietrich himself does not expect
this bili, amid the crush of other mat
ters, to be reached this winter.
The President has expressed his ap
proval of the Dietrich government
scheme it may be worth, while, to
outline it. Under it the Presi
dent shall appoint a Governor and three
Commissioners for Alaska, who with
three other persons elected by the peo- |
pie of Alaska, each from different judi
cial districts, shall constitute the Alas
ka Government Board. The Governor
shall convene and prorogue the board
when he deems it expedient. The board
shall have authority to make laws for
Alaska on the following subjects and
such 'others as Congress may from time
to time specify: Raising of revenue by
taxation; appropriation and expendi
ture of the public funds; construction
and maintenance of roads and trails;
establishment and maintenance of an
.educational system: care of the indigent
and insane: preservation of game: pub
lic health and moral?; establishment of
a constabulary outside the limits of in
corporated towns, with powers and du
ties simlar to those of the Northwest
ern police of Canada; creation and or
ganization of municipalities, including
the making and repeal of ordinances
therefor, and the establisment and
regulation of mining districts.
It is provided that Alaska shall not
be deemed an organized Territory of
the United States, but the Governor
shall have all tbe rights and privileges
of the territorial delegates in the
House of Representatives. Congross
can repeal any law passed by the
Government board. All male inhab
itants who have resided one year in
Alaska and forty days in the election
district are eligible to vote. The Dis
trict Court, as now existing, is abol
ished and a Supreme Court estab
lished, consisting of a Chief Justice
and three Associate Justices to be ap
pointed by the President, any two of
whom shall constitute a quorum. The
Justices of the Supreme Court shall
possess all the power, etc.. of the
present District Court. An additional
United States Attorney, Marshal and
clerk are provided.
Judges and officers of the courts are
forbidden to hold or be interested in
mining claims. Commissioners are
provided for with salaries fixed at a
maximum of $4000 with fees eliminat
ed. An inspector of accounts of Mar
shals, commissioners and clerks of
court is to be appointed by the Presi
dent. The Governor will issue licenses
and perform other executive adminis-"
trative and ministerial functions now
imposed on the district Judges. Elec
tions will be held every four years.
Last session when the bunch of
Alaskan legislation was up, Senator
Plan of Connecticut injected a pro
viso in the delegate bill to the effect
that nothing therein contained should
be understood as sanctioning the be
lief that Alaska should ever be admit
ted as a State. This, was accepted as
a gratuitous expression of New Eng
land sentiment concerning the West
and her aspirations, such as is being
daily manifested In the discussion of
the present statehood bill. In oppos
ing this bill and making a plea for
four States to be admitted when they
shall be. ripe and ready. Senator Tel
ler the other day declared that he
looked forward to the time, should
this be done, when Alaska, her vast
and varied natural resources fairly
developed, her valleys populous "with
hardy and energetic citizens, - would
apply and be admitted as the fiftieth
State. Thus Alaskan interests may be
said to be looking up, though it be
slowly. The delegate bill, defeated
last session, has not been heard of so
far during this, even though it has
the President's special recommenda
tion. It will doubtless go over and the
Dietrich bill be substituted ultimately.

tally injured.
PARIS, Feb. 11.â A new idea in plays
was exemplified at the Ambigu Theater
to-night, when there was produced a
realistic spectacular piece in four acts,
entitled "The Conquest of the Air," by
MM. Camille Audigler and Paul Gery.
ihe latter being the stage name of M
Archdeacon, the well-known Deputy
and aeronaut.
In the audience were many well
known first-nighters and members of
the Aero Club. The play, which is
largely based on facts Known to Paris
ians, tells the story of an unhappy in
ventor of an airship, who, after ruining
himself with his experiments, falls into
the hands of unscrupulous financiers,
who steal some of his pfans and sell
him out.
One of the scenes depicts the first
platform of the Eiffel Tower, followed
by a realistic ascent of the inventor -
airship. Something *nes wrong. an<l
with lightning-like rapidly it falls t>Â»
the ground, and the unfortunate genius
receives mortal injuries. In the la?t
scene his death is depicted, hiÂ» br
hearted wife standing by his bedside.
The player? acquitted themselves ad
mirably. M. Santos-Dumont and the
Comte de Dion were among the well
known Parisians impersonated.

Wolf.
One provides for a tax of l per cent

companies from Pennsylvania, Ohio,
Indiana and Maine pay a tax, which is
levied upon them by the application of
*hat is known as the "retaliatory"
law, the tax being the same on these
companies as is levied by their States
on California companies. The bill in

tax and provides for 8 tax of 1 per

companies not now. taxed. It is esti

ol the Assembly appointed to investi
gate the charges made against Supe
rior Judge Torrance of San Diego by
the Los Angeles Bar Association and
to report r>n whether the lower house

Friends of Torrance are gratified
with the information, but they had
hopes that the committee would go
<-\Â»-!i further and embody in its report
a full exculpation for him of any
acts unbecoming a Judge. It is said
that the evidence adduced has in no

pronounce Judge Torrance guilty of
any wrongful act ascribed to him.
The full transcript of the testimony
will be filed in the Assembly with the
report so that any member may read
it and know vi.on what the commit

ASSEMBLY MAY CITE EDITOR FOR CONTEMPT
DARES TO REFLECT
ON LEGISLATORS
Furor Is Created
by Journalist ol
Santa Cruz.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 11. â The edi
tor of the Santa Cruz Surf may be
cited for contempt of the Assembly.
The alleged contempt consists of a
statement published last Thursday in
the Surf that three of the members
of the Assembly committee of five ap
pointed to investigate the charges
made against Superior Judge Smith
of Santa Cruz County, by, those who
would impeach him, are programmed
and will hold the investigation with
their minds made up to exonerate
Judge Smith.
The furor that the publication has
raised here and the determination on
the part of thq Assemblymen alleged
to be programmed to have the editor
cited for contempt have altogether
overshadowed the charges. against the
jurist. A lively time is expected when
the editor is haled before the bar of
the Assembly.
The members of the committee that
the Surf boldly declares are pro
grammed are Beardslee, McCartney
and Atkinson. The article was head
ed "Will Do No Harm," and goes on
to say that the coming of the commit
tee will amount to nothing because of
the programming oÂ£ the three men
named.
The three Assemblymen are looking
up the law in the matter and say
there is plenty to justify contempt
proceedings. An editor was fined $500
in 1862 for contempt of the lower
house, they say. They will demand
that the Surf editor be brought be
fore the Assembly'and made to show
cause why he should not be punished
for contempt. It will devolve upon
him, they claim, to prove that the
three accused by him are really pro
grammed.
The other two members of the com
mittee are Burke of Alameda and
Lumley of Tulare, the latter a Demo
crat, the only one on the committee.
They have made the demand that the
editor of the Surf be brought to the
Assembly and be made to prove or
show that he cannot prove his alle
gation before the committee goes to
Santa Cruz to investigate. They say
they will not go till this Is done.
The committee has decided to go to
Santa Cruz next Thursday and the
intention is to have the contempt
proceedings held before then.
WILL. FIGHT FOR DELAY.
Boodlei-s, It Is Said, Do Not Want
Speedy Trial.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 11. â There
has been no change on the pro
gramme relative to the determination
of District Attorney Seymour to ar
raign Senators Emmons, Bunkers,
Wright and French, accused of brib
ery, next Saturday. It was said that
ii was Wright's intention to appear
before Judge Hart this morning and
demand that- he be arraigned and
given as speedy a trial as possible,
but neither he nor his attorney was
in evidence around the courthouse.
It is now believed that the defend
ants wiy be willing to let the prose
cution do all the forcing, the greatest
hope of the accused centering in a
campaign of delay that will permit
public sentiment to die out and of
ficial zeal to become tempered.

Oil Refinery Is a
Disturber. â 
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 11.â The trou
ble Kansas !a having over the State oil
refinery bill, that has passed both
houses of her Legislature and is now in
the hands of the Governor, has aroused
a sudden interest in the measure of
identical nature with that present

semblyman Warren F. John of San
Luis Oblsno County. The John bill had
been almost forgotten utnil the row
broke loose in Kansas, but now it is
one of the most discussed of those be
fore the Legislature at Sacramento.
In Kansas the fight against the
passage of the State oil refinery bill
caused such a loud cry of boodle that
a special committee has been appoint
ed by the Speaker of the lower house
to investigate. This is not the only
sensational result of the legislation.
The Standard Oil monopoly while the
bill Is In the hands of the Governor,
has shut down nearly all its works
in Kansas and has announced that it
will buy no more of the oil produced
by that State, with the result that it
has paralyzed the oil industry there at
least temporarily.
All this goes to show that the estab
lishment of a State oil refinery in any
State is a proposition that the Stand
ard Oil people are thoroughly opposed
to and will hght bitterly. The bill in
troduced by Assemblyman John, who
has woke up to find himself famous,
is as follows.
"There shall be established, erected
and equipped in the State of Califor
nia, as hereinafter ordered, a refinery
of petroleum, to be known as the Cali
fornia State oil refinery.
"The purpose of this refinery is to
purchase, receive and refine petroleum
as the word is applied to preparing
crude petroleum to various uses, for
supplying all institutions conducted at
the expense of the State of California
In whole or in part and to sell any sur
plus'or product of said refinery after
said institutions have been supplied to
all of their demands, or needs to use.
"For the purpose of establishing,
maintaining ard conducting the busi
ness of said refinery the office of man
ager of California State oil refinery is
hereby created."
The bill provides also that the Gov
ernor, the Surveyor General of the
State and the manager (the latter to
receive a salary of $5000 a year) shall
constitute an. advisory board. The bill
carries with it an appropriation of
5250,000 for the plant.
"I really do not expect to have my
bill become a law this session because
of the appropriation it carries, if for
no other reason," said Assemblyman
John to-day, "but I am going to make
the hardest fight T can for it, and if
nothing else is accomplished the sub
ject will be given a prominence that
will make the passage of such a bill
more probable at the next session.
There are many members of the house
who will get into the fight with me."
An oil bill that is going to be urged
with prospect of passage and one which
the Standard Oil Company is already
fighting is that of Dorsey, making
all oil-pipe lines common carriers. This
and John's bill have lain in the Corn
HEATED DEBATE
ON RIVER BILLS
DELAYS REPORT
Drainage Measures
Are Opposed by
Land Owners. â 
Special Dispatch to Tbe Call.
SACRAMENTO. Feb. 11.â Still held
in committee, the subject of heated de
bate, are the bills introduced to carry
out the recommendations of the board
of river engineers retained by the Cali
fornia River Improvement and Recla
mation Association to devise some plan
by which the flood waters of the San
Joaquin and ' Sacramento rivers may be
controlled. Opposition- to these bills
has held them in committee much
longer than is usual with such meas
ures and both houses are becoming im
patient at the delay.
These bills were introduced in the
Senate by Rush of Solano and in the
Assembly .by Moore of S"an Joaquin.
They provide for the creation of the
Sacramento Drainage District, the
same to be under the control of a board
of eleven Commissioners, and the ap
pointment of a committee of three to
go to Congress to urge the Government
to appoint a board of three engineers
to study and report upon the most fea
sible plan to carry out the recommen
dations of the river engineers.
The opposition to the bills has arisen
over the fear that they will vest too
much power in the board of eleven
Commissioners over existing reclama
tion districts and all lands included
therein and adjacent thereto. Many
owners of lands within the boundaries
of existing reclamation districts have
written to members of both houses ask
ing them to oppose the measures on the
floor, and it is to avoid any lengthy dis
cussion on the bills that the committee
is taking its time in an endeavor to
harmonize all conflicting interests in
necessary amendments before report
ing them back.
The trip of the Senate and Assembly
Committees on Drainage, Swamp and
Overflowed Lands, accompanied by va
rious officials and interested land own
ers, down the river to-day gave them
an insight into conditions aÂ» they pre
vail and may be the result of suggest
ing even better methods than those
contained in the bills under discussion.
mittee on Oil Industries and Oil Min
ing Interests ever since their introduc
tion in the early part of the session.
No meeting of the committee has been
held to consider them, but Dorsey
promises that one will be called Mon
day. He is not accused of acting
in bad faith by not having the bills
considered sooner, as most of the mem
bers have been away much of the time
on junketing trips, and it has not been
practicable to get a quorum together.
The only oil interest bill before the
committee that the Standard Oil cor
poration If not expected to fight is one
providing for the plugging up of aban
donÂ»J wells.
The other members of the Assembly
Oil Industries Committee are Chandler.
Pyle, Ells, John, Cleveland, Houser,
Atkinson and Perkins.

What Sulphur Does
For the Human Body in Health
and disease.
The mention of 'sulphur will recall
to many of us the early days when
our mothers and grandmothers gave
us our daily dose of sulphur and
molasses every spring and fall.
It was the universal spring and fall
"blood purifier," tonic and cure-all,
and, mind you, this old-fashioned
remedy was not without merit.
The idea was good, but the remedy
was crude and unpalatable' and a large
quantity had to be taken to get any
effect.
- Nowadays we get all the beneficial
effects of sulphur in a palatable, con-
centrated form, so that a single grain
is far more effective than a tablespoon-
ful of the crude sulphur.
In recent years research and ex-
periment . have proven that the best
sulphur for medicinal use is that ob-
tained from Calcium (Calcium Sul-
phide) and sold in drug stores under
the name of Stuart's Calcium Wafers.
They are small, chocolate-coated pel-
lets and contain the active medicinal
principle of sulphur in a highly con-
centrated, effective form.
Few people are aware of the value
of this form of sulphur in restoring
and maintaining bodily vigor and
health; sulphur acts directly on the
liver and excretory organs and purifies
and enriches the blood by the prompt
elimination of waste material.
Our grandmothers knew this when
they dosed us with sulphur and mo-
lasses every spring and fall, but the
crudity and impurity of ordinary
flowers of sulphur were often worse
than the disease and cannot compare
with . the modern concentrated prepa-
rations of .sulphur, of which Stuart's
Calcium Wafers fa undoubtedly the
best and most widely used. ;
1 They are the natural antidote for
liver and kidney troubles and cure con-
stipation and purify the blood In a way
that often surprises patient and physi-
cian alike. â¢ - -^
â¢ Dr. R. M. Wilkins, while experiment-
Ing with sulphur remedies, soon found
that the sulphur from Calcium was
superior to any other form. He says:
"For liver, kidney and blood troubles,
especially when resulting from con-
stipation or malaria, I have been sur-
prised at the results obtained from
Stuart's Calcium Wafers. In patients
suffering from boils and pimples and
even deep-seated carbuncles. I have
repeatedly seen them dry up and dis-
appear in four or five days, leaving the
skin clear and smooth. Although
Stuart's Calcium Wafers Is a proprie-
tary article and sold by druggists and
for that reason tabooed by many phy-
sicians, yet I know of nothing so safe
and reliable for constipation, liver and
kidney troubles and especially in all
forms of skin diseases as this remedy."
At any rate people who are tired of
pills, cathartics and so-called blood
"purifiers" will find In Stuart's . Cal-
cium Wafers a far safer, more palat-
able and effective preparation.

1.1 ORGANIZATION Bill-
FOB Till; NATIONAL GUARD
Features That Are Engrossing the
JYUentiou or Officers of the
State Soldiery.
The bill that" has been introduced
in Uic Legislature relative to the re
organization of the National Guard of
tli<- State, with a view to bring it
â within the provisions of the Dick bill,
so that the State may 'obtain aid from
the United States, la at this time 1 en
grossing the attention of the officers of
the j?uard. who are wondering if it
will pass in its present form. One
feature. which has attracted consider
able attention is the raise in the ex
pense of maintaining the office of ad
jutant general.
The biH,. 'provides for the salary. of
th* adiutant j; Bral $:;o(iÂ«, -assistant
adjutant general, $2400; one chief
clerk. $1800: three assistant clerks,
$ICOO each: stenographer, $1200. and
â Tmorer, $1200, making a total of
$14*400, or a little more than twice
what is now being paid: another fea
ture of the bill is that no one can be
a brigadier general or a field officer,
who has not been a company officer for
at least two years. Guardsmen say that
if this is adopted it will debar many
who have served long in the guard
from obtaining a commission, for the
â¢:i that thfy were not at any time
company officers, and that it would even
prevent men like General Wood and
ijvnerhl Funston from being commis
sioned should they sever their connec
tion frith the army and desire to enter
ihr service of the State.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 12. 1905
FOUR WITNESSES TESTIFY
AGAINST JUDGE SWAi'NE
House Managers Enter Objections to
Questions Asked by
Senators.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 11. â The en- i
tire time of the Senate to-day which \
wag not spent in executive session was i
given to the Swayne impeachment j
trial. Four witnesses were examined. ;
All of them were from Pensacola,
Fla., and they were introduced for the
purpose of showing that up to 1900
Judge Swayne had not acquired a res
idence in his district in Florida.
During the proceedings the question j
of the right of the House managers to
object to questions put to witnesses
by Senators was raised, but the pre- j
siding officer ruled that such objec- |
tions might be stated. The precedents â¢
quoted were to the effect that, while j
questions by Senators should be ad- j
mltted, counsel could properly object !
to the admissibility of replies made to !
them.

ADAMS SCORES
A BIG POINT
3lany Ballots Declared to
Be Fraudulent Are Now
Found to Be Genuine Votes
THE CONTEST CONTINUES
Should Disputed Precincts
Be Thrown Out Democrat
Would Still Ketain Seat
DENVER, Feb. 11.â At to-day's ses
sion of the joint gubernatorial contest
committee Governor Adams' attorneys
introduced a number of witnesses to
identify their ballots, which had been
j declared illegal by Republican experts.
â¢ With one exception, every witness iden
tified his ballot. The exception was
Louis E. Becker, who declared that the
Democratic ballot corresponding with
his number on the book was not his
ballot, as he voted the Republican
ticket. When asked to write the words
"Republican" and "Democratic" it waa
plain that the ballot shown him was
not In his handwriting.
Four witnesses went over the Repub
lican lists of alleged non-residents in as
many precincts and Identified practi
cally every name as belonging to a
bona fide resident. It developed that a
list of names, a majority of which were
misspelled, had been furnished to the
persons who canvassed one precinct on
behalf of Peabody.
Ballot boxes from fifteen precincts in
Huerfano County were opened at the
afternoon session. The ballots were
put into the hands of experts for exam
ination. In several cases the poll books
j were missing from the boxes and some
j of the boxes were in bad condition.
One ballot box was not brought into
the committee room, another having
been substituted by mistake at Walsen
burg, the county seat of Huerfano
County. This box will be produced on
Monday.
Should sufficient fraud be shown in
these precincts to warrant the Legisla
ture In throwing them out Governor
Adams will, nevertheless, retain his
seat as Governor.

DUCHESS FINDS
A NEW FRIEND
Former May Goelet Becomes
Very Much Attached to
the Countess 'of Essex
BOTH AEE AMERICANS
Seen Frequently Together in
London on Shopping Trips
and Also at the Theater
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Feb. 11.â Since the young
Duchess of Roxburghe came to make
her home in England she and the
American Countess of Essex have be
come fast friends. It is being remark
ed in society circles that where thÂ«
Countess is the Duchess is sure to be,
or, at any rate, not far off. The at
tachment is so strong that the Countess
frequently acts as chaperon to the for
mer May Goelet. They go shopping to
gether and to the theater and other
places of entertainment, nearly always
escaping identification.
The Countess is recognized as a de
cidedly matronly sort of person, with
out the slightest display of wealth or
ostentation and this feature in her
character is said to appeal to the Duch
ess. Recently the Countess took the
Duchess to some of the charitable insti
tutions in which she is interested in
London. Institutions that assist young
women who have fallen on evil times,
maternity homes and asylums for old
women afe the special object of Lady
Essex's attention.
It is hinted that her ladyship will, in
future, be the guide of the Duchess in
all matters pertaining to charity. The
report has caused much jealousy, be
cause society women in England who
interest themselves in certain forms of
charity are always looking out for rich
recruits to join their forces. If one wo
man is devoted to hospitals she wants
all her friends to supoprt that particu
lar charity, or, on the other hand, if
she is interested in institutions for the
blind, she will canvass all her friends
for their spare cash in order that Lady
So-and-So may be shown to have con
tributed.
SARGENT, THE PAINTER,
ENTERS LONDON SOCIETY
Entertains in His Studio and Fre-
quently Dines at Houses of
Friends.
LONDON. Feb. 11.â John S. Sar
gent, the famous American portrait
painter, is gradually getting over the
extreme shyness which many have
often taken for brusqueness, and
which prevented him from attending
the many social functions to which he
was invited. He now not only enter
tains a great deal in his studio, but
dines out very frequently. He is de
voted to music, and Lady Maud War
render and other titled amateurs have
often sung for him.
It was in his studio that Lady de
Grey, the Queen's bosom 'friend and
perhaps the greatest connoisseur of
good music in London, discussed the
idea of getting up Sunday afternoon
concerts for bored Londoners. The
idea was warmly seconded by Sargent,
with the result that arrangements
were made to take Bechstein Hall, and
the Duchess of Manchster. another
lover music; Sargent, Sir Lawrence
Alma Tadema and the French and
Spanish Embassador and Lady Maud
Warrender formed a small committee.
The first concert, given last Sunday,
was a great success.
The members of the orchestra were
rehearsed by Lady de Grey and gave
a very good account of themselves.

Regarding Champagne Importations In 1904,
Bonfort's Wine and Spirit Circular of Jan. 10, 1903, says:
** Messrs. Fredk. dc Bary & Co. brought over last year to this side of ,
the water a greater number of cases of Champagne than has ever I
hitherto been known, and these importations speak in the strongest s

YAQUIS MAKE
ANOTHER RAID
Wealthy Sonora Rancher
and Party Waylaid and
Slain by the Indians
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TUCSON, Ariz., Feb. 11.â Pessengers
arriving from Sonora report that the
Yaquis are still on the waroath in the
vicinity of La Colorado and that the
efforts of the Mexican authorities to
put them down have thus far proved
futile.
Antonio Lares, a wealthy rancher,
who with several of his neighbors was
en route to San Marcial, was overtaken
by the Indians and the entire party
slaughtered. They had heard that the
Yaquis had been seen in their neigh
borhood, and had set out together in
seapch of a place of safety. The num
ber of their assailants or the direction
they took is unknown, as none of the
party survived. Their bodies were
found lying by the roadside.
General Torres was in La Colorado
when the news reached that camp and
at once dispatched a detachment of
troops to the scene of the outrage.
JUMPS DEAD MAN'S
CLAIM IN DEL NORTE
Row May Follow Attempt of Miner
to Keep Property of Murdered
Storekeeper.
GRANTS PASS. Feb. 11. â There ia
j much trouble brewing in Del Norte
â¢ County, Cal.. over the "jumping" of
i the mining claim of Patrick Dunn, the
I aged storekeeper, who was recently
murdered by two men now held in
i custody at Crescent City. The claim
| was jumped by L. W. Higgins. a min
ing man of this city, 'and who estab
, lishes his right to the property on
; technical grounds. While the old man
1 had mined the claim for the last thirty
I years He did not fulfill all the require
ments prescribed by law, hence his
title may not hold, though the ad
i ministrators of the old man's estate
j will make a hard fight to "bounce"
1 Higgins.
The many friends of Dunn are in
â¢ dignant over the affair and declare
! that as a matter of justice they will
J see that Higgins is removed from the
; claim he has jumped on Patrick

GRIM RUSSIAN
LIFE ON STAGE
Play Barred in the Realm
of the Czar Produced at
Avenue Theater in London
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON. Feb. 11.â Eugen Tchiri
koffs play "The Chosen People," which
a Russian company is presenting, in
3lusslan for a week at the Avenue The
ater, is one of the most striking works
teen here in recent years. As soon as
their London engagement is over the
company will cross the Atlantic to
give the Tchirikoff piece in the United
States, where it will not fail to arouse
keen interest, portraying as it does the
grubbing lives of the Jews in Russian
villages, the conflicting ambitions
which divide them and the relentless
persecution to which they are subject
ed. Strangely enough, the play was
*;iven for the first time in London on
the evening before the news came of
the wholesale butchery of working-men
in the Czar's capital.
"The Chosen People." which is dis
tinctly a play with a purpose, was re
3 used a license in Russia. What
little action it tains takes
place in the shop and living
room of Lesser Frenkel, an old
Jewish clockmaker. The first scenes
abound in impassioned dialogue be
iween Frenkel, his son Boruch and his
assistant Shloime, which demonstrate
how strong are the opposing creed* of
Zionism and Socialism among them
and their kind.
They have within their narrow
ixjundÃ the seeds of civil war, and are
â¦ opether only by the common
<iread of the Muscovite. Kvery char

Xarhman. the village schoolmas
ter and a fierce champion of Zionism;
Keresir., the Christian student, and
Lia, the eld clockmaker's daughter.
Tragedy is in the air from the moment
that the curtain rises, and we have an
inkling of what shape it will take when
it berimes evident that Beresin, the
cmvert to Christianity, and Lia, the
Jeweae, are in love with each other.
SLAUGHTER ON STAGE.
The piay ends with one of the most
ghastly scenes of butchery ever put on
the stage, the members of the entire
household falling victims to an anti-
Semitic mob. First the Frenkels' Chris
tian maid sprvant enters and asks to
he allowed to leave, as the Jews of the
town are to be attacked.. Then comes
the news of the outrages at Kishenev,
and a policeman arrives and orders the
shop" to be closed. The terror-stricken
inmates are busy concealing their valu
ables and attempting some rude barri
cades when the noise of the mob is
heard outside. Then comes an affecting
struggle between the heroine's love for
her sweetheart and desire to live and
her attachment to her father and her
creed.
Beresin implores her to renounce her
religion in which she really no longer
believes, hut the girl's race feeling con
quer." and i~he stands by her father's
side to facethe enemies of her people.
The lover presses a revolver upon her,
to be used in the last extremity, and
then the door crashes in, the mob en
ters and the Jews are struck down with
bludgeon and ax. Darkness descends
upon the stage, littered with prostrate
forms, and the curtain falls.
The St. Petersburg Dramatic Society,
which presents "The Chosen People,"
can lÂ»ear comparison with any foreign
company that ever has appeared in
London.
SIIAKESPI AHirs POPULARITY.
Shak*Â»spear.- would rival even Barrie
in royalties if he had a copyright now.
"The Taming of the Shrew" is nearing
its hundredth night at the Adelphi,
with Oscar Asche and Lily Brayton;
Waller's "Henry V" is doing uncom
monly well at the Imperial, and now,
succeeding "The -Tempest," Beerbohm
Tree puts on "Much Ado About Noth
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 12, 1905.
ing" at His Majesty's. It is not so
gorgeous a spectacle as the Tree ver
sion of Shakespeare usually is, yet the
setting is lavish and in good taste, and
with the usual scrupulous attention to
detail.
One interesting feature of the pro
duction is the inclusion of the scone in
Beatrice's chamber just before she
starts for church. It is usually omit
ted and would not be missed from the
present performance except for the at
tractive stage picture. Another depar
ture is to make the love scene between
Beatrice and Benedict take place in the
corridor of the church instead of be
fore the altar. Tree, of course, was
Benedict, while the Beatrice was Wini
fred Emery, who was greeted uproar
iously on her return to the stage after
a long illness.
Laurence Irving and Sidney and
Lionel Brough were also in the cast.
PUCCINI'S PROTEGE.
Puccini, the Italian composer of "La
Boheme," has a new protege and her
name is "Butterfly." As readers may
foresee, this acquisition of the maes
tro's is a sequel to his recent enter
prise of composing an opera on the
theme of John Luther Long's story,
"Madame Butterfly." This work was,
it will be remembered, a complete fail
ureâSO complete that Puccini's admir
ers throughout his native land were
greatly cast down. None more so than
an honest bookkeeper in Genoa, who
declared that outrageous treatment had
been Accorded to his favorite composer.
To this bookkeeper a daughter had
just been born and the good man
promptly resolved to have her chris
tened Butterfly. The Registrar of
Births endeavored to dissuade him
from "branding his daughter for life,"
as th^ official put it, but the father was
determined, and so it stands. This
came to Puccini's ears, and though or
dinarily he doesn't care for children, he
asked the father and child to come to
Eec him. " They arrived one fine day,
and not only they but all the little
girl's "sisters, cousins and aunts," so
that the overwhelmed composer found
himself holding a sizable reception. It
wasn't wholly a treat to Puccini, but
he promised to have an eye on Butter
fly, and her future is thought to be as
sured.

CHORUS GIRLS
FLEE FROM FIRE
Casino Theater in New York
Bursts Into Flame During'
the Behearsal of an Opera
NEW YORK, Feb. 11.â The Casino
Theater, one of the most historic of
the New York playhouses and the
scene of the production of many fam
ous light operas, was damaged by fire
to-day. The loss will reach $50,000.
The^ blaze began in a dressing-room
on the third floor over the stage, while
a rehearsal of chorus girls of the
'Lady Teazle" company was in pro
gress. Though they were thrown in a
panic, the members of the company
e&caped uninjured, with the exception
of one chorus girl, who fell while go
ing down the stairs of the stage en
trance and was painfully but not
dangerously hurt.
The "Lady Teazle" company, which
was rehearsing when the fire broke
out, is headed by Lillian Russell, but
she was not in the theater at the time.
About forty chorus girls were rehears
ing in costume and were crowding up
a narrow stairway to a dressing-room
on the third floor, above the stage,
when a burst of flame and smoke from
the dressing-room above drove them
back. In their frantic haste one girl
was thrown down and hud to be car
ried out of the theater. She was not
bady hurt.
So swift was the advance of the
flames along the flimsy material in the
scenery that the chorus girls were in
a panic when they rushed for the stage
exits. Ignoring the efforts of the stage
manager to calm them, they ran
shrieking down the stairs, arrayed in
the gay costumes of the play, and
were given shelter in the near by
stores.
A stage carpenter, who lingered too
leng in an effort to save some of the
scenery, was overcome by the smoke,
but revived on reaching the street.
There were no spectators in the the
ater when the fire broke out. Two
hours later the building would have
been occupied by an audience com
posed principally of women and chil
dren. As it was, the chorus girls had
some difficulty in escaping the hurried
advance of the flames. The exit of an
1 audience under similar circumstances
J w*>uld have been hampered by the fact
that the main entrance is by a winding
staircase.
The Casino is located at the corner j
of Thirty-ninth street and Broadway, j
in the very heart of the theater and
hotel district, and no sooner was the
fire under way, with the bursting of
the blaze and smoke from the third
story windows, than a tremendous
throng gathered on Broadway for i
blocks in both directions, stalling all
traffic and hampering the efforts of
the firemen.
In the Casino some of the most ;
noted of light opera productions have i
been presented and achieved their first I
i and greatest successes. "Erminie" had .
its beginning and initial success there,
with a cast including Francis, Pauline
Hall and Marie Jansen, and ran for
two years. It has been closely iden
tified with the successes of manrf'of
tlu- stars whose names are nowj/fa
miliar to the patrons of light opera,
including Lillian Russell, Edna May,
De Wolf Hopper and Jefferson de
Angelis. The house is under the man
agement of Sam S. and Lee Shubert.

PRAISES POLICE
OF THIS CITY
Inspector G. Van Arkel of
The Hague, Holland, Says
Force Is Best in the AYorld
STUDIES OUR METHODS
Has Good Words for Chief
AYittniau and Officers of
Local Department
The San Francisco Police Depart
ment may well feel flattered when it
learns the high opinion entertained of
it by G. Van Arkel, an inspector of po
lice from The Hague, Holland, who is
here on a tour of the United States,
taking observations on police methods
and other matters connected with the
capture of criminals and the enforc
ing: of laws.
Inspector Van Arkel, who has been
three years an inspector of The Hague
force, is a man of close observation.
He obtained leave of absence from his
superiors with the object of making
a study of the American police in all
of the big cities.
On his arrival in San Francisco Van
Aik*| made the acquaintance of Chief
Wurman and found him a most ac
commodating official. The Chief con
ducted him through the city and ex
plained the management of the local
force.
The Hague official considers Chief
Wittman to be one of the best heads
of police departments in the United
St.Mes. Of the captains he is also pro
fuse in his praise.
The detective department and its
method of identification and photo
graphic system, known as the "rogues'
gallery." interested him, as did also
the system of keeping the records in
aphabetical order, where the history
of criminals can be ascertained in a
moment's time.
Police patrol wagons, in which per
sons arrested are conveyed to the
prisons, he said, were an improvement
en European police systems, where a
p< rson arrested has to be walked or
dragged, as the case may be, from
the place of arrest to the station
house. The San Francisco police box
system, where the men on duty in the
outlying sections of the city can in
form their headquarters of what is
going on, he considers to be far ahead
of the old method of reporting to ser
ge-ants.
The Hall of Justice prison he con
siders to be one of the best he has
ever seen. Of the policemen he has
observed in San Francisco he is frank
In saying that they are as fine, if not
finer, than any other body of police in
the world.
The only criticism he makes is of
thÂ» limited number of men employed,
considering' population and territory
to be covered. The Hague, with a lit
tle over 200,000 population, has a
force of 650 men, while Ran Francisco,
with more than double that popula
tion, has a similar number. In The
Higue the Mayor is the head of the
Police Department and next to him
and directly responsible to him is the
Chief, with fourteen inspectors and a
staff of subordinates far outnumber
ing the non-commissioned officers of
this city. From Inspector Van Arkel's
Idea 1000 policemen would not be any
too many for San Francisco. The
beats over which a patrolman has to
travel are large enough for two men to
cover.
Inspector Van Arkel will visit San
Quentin during the coming week and
make a close study of the treatment of
the criminals there.

FINE SINGERS
WILL BE HEARD
Conried's Metropolitan Com
pany to Perform at Grand
Opera-House Next April
The Grand Opera-house in April will
be the scene of the most brilliant sea
son in San Francisco's operatic history,
when there will be given twelve per
formances by the Conried Metropolitan
Opera Company. The entire season
will be given under the personal direc
tion of Mr. Conried. The details of the
local management will be in the hands
of Charles W. Strine, who is well
known to opera-goers here.
The production of "Parsifal" by Mr.
Conried in New York one year ago
stirred up a storm of excitement un
paralleled in the history of American
musical enterprise. Mr. Conried fought
for what he believed to be his right to
wrest Richard Wagner's immortal mv-
Bic-drama from the grasp of Bay
reuth, and Californians will at last be
enabled to enjoy that soul-stirring
work without crossing the Atlantic or
Pacific.
Nor will "Parsifal" be the only mas
terpiece in the Metropolitan repertory
to claim the attention of our music
lovers. The Metropolitan management
promises opportunities of enjoying
operas widely different In character,
and including several of the ever pop
ular works of the great Italian compos
ers.
The artists intrusted with the inter
pretation of the operas are unrivaled-
Foremost among them may be men
tioned Enrico Caruso, who among ten
ors now occupies the position once filled
among sopranos by Patti, and Marcella
Sembrich, who is universally recog
nized as Patti's successor in the field of
melody. On these two singers, and that
most admirable of barytones, Antonio
Scotti, will fall the burden of singing
the chief parts in the Italian operas
which will be presented. Side by side
with them we may count upon hearing
the celebrated American contraltos,
Edyth Walker and Louise Homer; the
favorite French basso, Marcel Journet;
and Arcangelo Rossi, the excellent
buffo basso.
The leading roles in "Parsifal" will
be intrusted to Mme. Nordica, probably
the greatest of living dramatic so
pranos and one of the most renowned
American prima donnas, who will al
ternate in the role of Kundry with
Olive Fremstadt, the Swedish-Amerl
can prima donna; Alois Burgstaller,
the greatest of living German tenors,
who created the role of Parsifal in
New York after appearing in the title
part at Bayreuth and in New York;
Anton Van Rooy and Otto Goritz, by
long odds the best living exponents of
Amfortas and Klingsor; Robert Blass,
an equally remarkable Gurnemanz;
Adolf Muhlmann, Josephine Jacoby,
Bella Alten and other popular stars.
The orchestra of the Metropolitan
Opera Company, under the direction al
ternately of Alfred Hertz, who conduct
ed at all New York performances of
"Parsifal"; Arturo Vigna, the worthy
successor of Mancinelli, and Nahan
Franko, an American conductor, will
lend beauty and dignity to the season,
while the scenic accessories will be
worthy of the wide reputation of the
Metropolitan Opera Company.
THEATRICAL MECHANICS
WILL GIVE BIG BENEFIT
Every Playhouse in the City Will
Contribute Its Best Numbers to
the Programme.
A great amount of interest is mani
fested in the twelfth annual benefit
in aid of the charity fund of San
Francisco Lodgre No. 21, Theatrical
Mechanical Association, which will
take place at the 1 Alhambra Theater
next Friday afternoon, February 17.
So many have been the professional
volunteers that the programme com
mittee has been at its wits' end devis
ing ways to keep the performance
from lasting until far into the night.
There will be something good from
every theater in the city and a special
feature will be an orchestra of twenty
men under the direction of Genaro
Saldierna. Some of the scenes will
be set in full view of the audience and
thera will be many absolute novelties
on the programme.
Tickets have been going with a rush
and reserved seats will be on sale at
Sherman, Clay and Co.'s on and after
Monday morning.

ASKS A SHARE
OF THE PROFITS
Business Man of Garden
City Files Suit for Ac
counting Against Partners
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 11.â Suit was com
menced to-day in the Superior Court
for the dissolution of the Rucker-Mad
sen Company, one of the largest furni
ture firms in the city. The action was
brought by Alfred Madsen against
Samuel N. Rucker. The complaint
asks that the copartnership be dis
solved, a receiver appointed, an ac
counting had and that the stock of
goods be sold and the debts paid and
the profits divided.
When the firm was organized Madsen
advanced $5000 cash and Rucker fur
nished merchandise to that amount.
Rucker and Madsen each took 985
Bhares of stock in the concern, and A.
L. Green, J. L. Stull and M. E. Page
ten shares each. The remaining 5000
shares were held in the treasury.
Madsen charges Rucker with holding
a secret meeting of the directors on
January 3, 1905, and removing Madsen
as secretary and vice president and
electing Qreen as his successor. It is
alleged that Rucker also had Issued to
himself additional shares of stock and
took exclusive control of the books and
business and has since refused to al
low Madsen to have any voice in the
management of the firm's affairs.
During the early part of last month
the firm was attached on a $350 debt
contracted by Madsen. This is alleged
to have caused the breach in the firm.

CHARGES FRAUD
WAS PRACTICED
rjient. Cnable to Sign Name,
Finds Lawyer Has Power
of Attorney on Record
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Feb. 11.
The troubles of the Gooby family
have been once more brought into
prominence by tho h'ling of a repudia
tion of a. power of attorney by John j
Gooby. who states that the document i
put on record by Attorney D. Mitchell
is fraudulent. The Goobys at one time
had considerable property, but trouble
arose betwen the husband and wife
and Mitchell, acting as Gooby's at
torney, was horsewhipped by Mrs.
Gooby. There were several suits at
the time and in 1888. the pair having
bten denied a divorce, signed an agree
ment of separation.
Xow G.ooby has fallen out with hid
attorney and issues the following re
pudiation of an alleged fraudulent
document, that has been of record un
beknown to him sine 1902:
"Know all mer by these presents
that whereas- one David Mitchell did
on the Ist aay ot August, 1902, cause
U< be recorded in the office of the
County Reorder of Alameda County
a document purporting to be a full
r.ov.er of attorney from one John
Gooby to said David Mitchell, now
therefore I, John Gooby, do declare
and pronounce said document wholly
false and fraudulent in oach and every
recital thereof in so far as the same
relate? to mo.
"That 1 ana anable to read or write.
That I never k-iew of the existence of
such :t document or record thereof,
nor did I ever have the least suspicion
of the existence of the same until the
same was read to me from the records.
â¢ I therefore absolutely and un
equivocally repudiate ihe same as not
being my ;<<â ; O r deed and 1 hereby re
vok' . countermand, annul and make
void by these presents a'l nowers or
authority ever (n swiy way by me given
said David Mitchell"
"His (x) Mark."

"J131" FORCE TO RESCUE
<'. W. Lippman Violates the
Traditions of College by
Appearing in Quaint Garb
Beikeley Office San Francisco Call.
'-'14 8 Center Street, Feb. 11.
Indignant that ft mere sopiiomore
should presume to wear the brand of
corduroy trousers which university
tradition decrees shall be used exclu
sively by Junior and seniors at college,
a mob of 100 juniors waylaid C. \V.
Lippman at noon to-day as he de
scended the steps of South Hall and
proceeded with him to the chemistry
pond on the campus, where Lippman's
objectionable trousers were given a
thorough wetting.
Lippman howled in protest against
the treatment he was receiving and of
fered to dispossess himself of the cor
duroys; if he were spared the ducking
in the nond. which he knew was in
â  - â¢ " - . - - --â¢....' s â 
store for him. No such leniency was ac
corded him. however, the junior be
lieving that only by ducking Lipp
mao while "'â¢. attired in the offensive,
trousers could the. slight upon the
junior class be avenged. Lippman
accordingly was led to the brink of
the pond by a quartet of ' husky
juniors and then thrown into the icc
ccld water. The pond was covered
with a scum of emerald hue and this
added to the picturesque appearance
made by the drippingsophomore when
he. emerged from the pond. r-^j
"Now will you be good, soph?"
yelled the juniors in jubilation, and
then came the junior class yell, re
peated again and again in triumph.
"Big Jim" Force, captain of the
varsity football team, happened along
and. swiftly swooping down on the
crowd, rescued the luckless Lippman
and bade the juniors depart.
Lippman was put to bed to avoid
the possibility of serious results fol
lowing his Involuntary bath. The uni
versity committee on student affairs
was informed of the occurrence, but
none of the ringleaders was sum
moned to give account of the Ivizing.
Lippman is a brilliant student, son
of a wealthy family, which is promi
nent in the mercantile; life of San Fran
cisco. He came from Lowell High
School to the university and promptly
scored as a .student.

SHAKESPEARE
IN OPEN AIR
Ben Greets Players Produce
"As You Like ft*' Under
Oaks on University Campus
UNIQUE STAGE SETTING
English Actors Give Beauti
ful Rendering of Com
edy in a Delightful Spot
Berkeley Oflice San Francisco Call,
11148 Center Street, Fob. 11.
Under such leafy boughs' as Shakes
peare must ha- c had in mind when ho
wrote the forest scenes of "As You
Like It," and with soft light and sun
and vagrant wind to lend vivid reality
U> the picture, Ben Greefs company of
English player* this afternoon gave a
unique production of the comedy,
deemed by mary to be the finest of
Shakespeare's plays.
The university campus served as the
setting for the production. Skies from
whi'h came soft light and sun were
thÂ«^ covering foi the playhouse on the
campus, Tnd all the life of the forest,
in Â» measure, Â«as drawn upon by Ben
Greet to produce the enchanting ef
fects that attended his company's per
formance.
in Strawberry Canyon the tempo
rary stage and amphitheater had been
arranged, and there a throng of
play-levers gathered to greet the
player fÂ«>!k. The stago was apparently
nothing more than a slight rise of
ground, hemmed in by oaks, with
shrubbery serving as a retiring room.
The spectators had nothinp to call
their minds from forest scenes and
could easily drift with the tide that
bore them into the land of Shakes
peare's imagination, where Jacques,
tle melancholy, bandied words with
tho love-sick Orlando, jested with a
f'jol in motley, and made sporl
of AikJi'pv am! her lover. Glimpses
of the <iki university buildings could
be har! through the trees, and at inter
vals t,h? striking of the great bell on
the campus spoke the passing of the
hours, but nothing dissipated the il
lusion.
Qreet chose for himself the role of
Ja,cques. his sonorous voice carrying
all of tlffit notahie character's line:?
to every part of the canyon. The Rosa
lind was Constance Ciawley, a pretty
figure in doublet and hose, always per
fectly in the picture. There was a good
Touchstone by Maurice Robinson and
a handsome lover for an Orlando in
John Bayer Crawley. Minor roles were
ii. capable and experienced hands. Uni
versity students served as foresters,
caroling thfÂ» songs of the wfldwood iB
charmine fashion. Thet.e last per
former? were A. E. McMillan. \V. it
Kneiss, U. H. Hunt, Paul Ligda. W.

SILTAN PAINTS HIS FACE
TO HIDE HIS ILLNESS
Abdul Hamid of Turkey Pretends to
Believe That He Is
Immortal.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Feb. 11.âRe
ports are again in circulation that the
Sultan is dangerously ill. His Majesty
Abdul Hamid appears in the usual re
ligious processions from the Yildiz
Kiosk, but spectators are unable to
pierce the paint that always covers his
cheeks in public, and to detect whether
he shows signs of illness.
The Sultan never betrays physical
suffering. His impassive calm never
seems ruffled. No matter how ill he
may be, he insists on appearing in the
Selamlik procession each Friday. The
Sultan pretends to be believe he is im
mortal. For more than thirty years he
has not permited an official bulletin
about his health to be issued by his
I hysioians. Several times it has been
known he was almost at the point of
death, but no bulletins were issued
from the Yildiz Kiosk.
The Suitan always rises at 8 and puts
on a dark-colored dressing gown. It is
only when he expects an early state
visit that he done a gold-embroidered
coat which fits easily, not to say bag
gily: for His Sultanship. like most el
derly gentlemen, prefers comfort to ap
pearance in his dress. As soon as
prayers are ended breakfast is served,
and then an officer presents official
papers, and the government spies, of
whom there is a considerable army in
constant employment, make their re
port?. Then the second breakfast, or
dejeuner, the thief meal of the day, is
iinr.ouroed. and at this repast all the
dish-H arrive at table sealed.
After luncheon coffee and cigarettes
appear, the cigarettes which the Sul
tan smokes being made out of tobacco
specially grown and sorted for his ex
clusive use. A siesta, lasting two hours,
follows, and in the afternoon there are
further reports and documents to be
considered, a.nd the evening is passed
in listening to performances on the
piano. The Sultan's taste in this direc
tion turns to French ballet music.
Thp following notice has just been
placed in a prominent position on the
walls of a music hall in Glasgow:
"Whirtling or cheering with the feet is
strictly prohibited."

Dangerous
dandruff
/
There is no denying th*
fact that dandruff is
dangerous â to the life and
vitality of the hair. It is
the outward manifestation
of an unhealthy condition
of the scalp, and if
neglected will surely result
in the loss of the hair, the
appearance of premature
old age and ultimate
baldness. Coke Dandruff
Cure not only quickly
removes every trace of
dandruff from the scalp,
but positively prevents its
recurrence. It is a
delightfully refreshing
tonic, without a trace of
sulphur or any injurious
ingredients, and when
faithfully used has proved
its ability over and over
again to produce a heavy,
luxuriant growth of hair
where all other remedies
and formulas have failed.
Thin, brittle and poor hair,
therefore, need no longer
be a source of mortification
to any one. What Coke
Dandruff Cure has. done
for thousands it can and
will do for you. Your
druggist will tell you the
same story. Get a bottle
to-day and try it.

WILL DIRECT
ART MUSEUM
IN NEW YORK
ENGLISH ART CONNOISSEUR, 1
WHO WILL HEAD METROPOL
ITAN MUSEUM IN NEW YORK. I
Caspar Clarke Will
Leave England
for America.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Feb. 11.â There could be
no more conclusive tribute to the emi
nence and value of Sir Caspar Pur
don Clarke's services in behalf of ap
plied art than the profound expres
sions of regret that have been elicited
by the announcement of his resigna
tion of the directorship of the South
Kensington Museum in order to as
sume the management of the Metro
politan Museum of Art in New York.
His defection is regarded as a national
loss.
In well informed circles it is be
lieved that it is not the temptation of
a much larger .salary which has in
duced him to take this step, but
rather the desire to escape the red
tape which has hampered his control
of the foremost institution of its kind
in the world. This view of the case
is .strengthened by the fact that by
his action he has forfeited all right
to the snug pension which he might
have claimed in a few years.
Sir Purdon is in his fifty-ninth
year, but as zealous, enthusiastic and
untiring as when he first entered the
museum forty-three years ago. At
the end of a three years' course he
won the national medal for architec
ture. As an architect he has often
furnished gratifying evidence of his
practical skill, exquisite taste and wide
acquaintance with varying types. He
assisted in designing the new build
ings for the museum, which are not
yet completed. The Bethnal Green
Museum and several consular and
embassy buildings in the Far East
were designed by him. In arranging
exhibitions his services have been In
frequent demand. The Indfan city,
which was so greatly admired at the
Indian exhibition in London, wa.s his
creation.
The most enduring monument to his
memory lies in the wondrous Oriental
treasures, worth a King's ransom,
with which he has enriched South Ken
sington. To obtain them he made a
long sojourn in India and Persia, pur
suing his quest in the darkest corners
of old cities with a whole-souled en
thusiasm that rendered him indifferent
to hostility and danger. It was no easy
matter for a white man to seek in their
lair such relics as Sir Purdon was bent
on securing, especially when they in
clude, as they did on more than one oc
casion, articles over which the sanctity
of mosque or temple had been cast.
His contributions to archaeological re
searches have long caused him to be
regarded as one of the foremost au
thorities in England.
Jlie appointment in 1896 as chief di
rector of the South Kensington Mu
seum was a tardy recognition of the
value of his multifold services. He
was knighted in 1902, and that also
misrht properly be regarded as a much
belated honor, considering* the large
number of mediocre folk who receive
that title. ;
That he will ably fill the late General
di Cesnola's place no one doubts. He is
not only a great connossieur and a man
of profound learning in his special fields
of study, but he is also a practical man
who can do things and an excellent or
ganizer when he is allowed to have his
own way. The Board of Education,
which for the last three years has had
control of the South Kensington Insti
tution, Is sorely puzzled as to a man to
replace him. They will have some
months to look around, as he will not
leave his post until next September.

LONDON, Feb. 11. â The one topic

Whistler's great portrait of Sarasate
has arrived from the Carnegie Insti
tuted Pittsburg; the Boston Museum of
Fine Art has sent his "Muster Smith"
and the "Rose of Lyme Regis," while
from Chicago has come his "Noc
turne."
The King has lent all his Whistler
paintings and the French Government
has followed suit. Now that the
Whistler rage is on again there is a
second boom in all Whistler relics. An
American recently gave 5 guineas for
one of Whistler's invitation cards to
his Bohemian parties. In the corner
of the card is the characteristic "but
terfly" which he used instead of his
signature. The friend of Whistler
who sold the card has a collection of
over fifty of them.

Al>o a few tacts <Â»n tli*- Same Subject.
We hesr ir.uch nowadays about
health foods and hygienic living, about
regetarianiEm d many other fads
clone iÂ»i" sainÂ« line.
Restaurants may be found in the
large riiies ivhere no meat, pastry or
coffee is served and the food crank is
In hi? glory, and arguments and
theori^F galore are advanced to prove
meat Â» r as never intended for human
JElomachs. and almost make us believe
that our sturdy ancestors who lived
four score years in robust health on i
;oast beef, pork and mutton must have
Ixen grossly ignorant of the lawe of
health.
< >ur forefathers had other things to
6o than formulate theories about the
food they ate. A warm welcome was
extended â¢.. any kind from bacon to
acorns.
A healthy appetite and common sense
are excellent guides to follow In mat-
ter? of diet, and a mixed diet of grains.
fruits and meats is undoubtedly the |
best.
As compared with grains and vege-
tables, meat furnishes the most nutri-
ment in a highly concentrated form
and is digested and assimilated more
quickly than v^pretaMes and grains.
Dr. Julius Remmson on this subject
says Nervous persons, people run
down in health and of low vitality
should at meat and plenty of it. If
the digestion is too feeble at first it
may be easily corrected by the regular
use of Stuarl's Dyspepsia Tablets after
each meal. Two of these excellent
ta.blcts t-jken after dinner will digest
several thousand grains of meat, eggs
or other animal food in three hours,
ajid ri'i matter how \vÂ«>ak stomach
may b<\ do trouble will be experienced
if. â¢ regular practice is made of using
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. because
they supply the pepsin and diastase
necessary to perfect digestion, and
every form of indigestion will be over-
come by their use.
"That large â¢'lass of people who come
tinder the head of nervous dyspeptics
should eat plenty of meat and insure
its proper digestion, by the daily use
of a safe, harmless digestive medicine
like Stuarts Dyspepsia Tablets com-
posed of the natural digestive princi-
ples, pepsin, diastase, fruit acids, and
â¢alts, \vhi>h actually perform the work
of digrstlnn. Cheap cathartic medi-
cines, masquerading under the name
*>f dyspepsia cures, are useless for in-
digesti'in as they have absolutely no
CfTert upon the actual digestion of food.
Dyspepsia in all it? many forms is
elmply a failure of the stomach to
digest food, and the sensible way to
solve the riddle and nan the dyspepsia
is to make daily use at meal time of
a. preparation like Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets, which is endorsed by the medi-
cal profession and known to contain
active digestive principles.
A.' druggists sell Stuart'Â« Dyspepsia
Tablets at "M cents for full treatment.

Frank P. Flint. United States Senator
olFct. will takr- plare next Wednesday
o Ttrarsday evening. Invitations? will

Thr Senator-elect and Congressman
elect Duncan E. McKinlay, Second

terest in .Sacramento Valley affairs,
especially on subjects relating to the
navigation of the stream and the con
tiol of flood waters. Yesterday, ac
companied by members of the Legisla
ture and a delegation from the Sacra
niÂ»-nio Board of Trade, they visited
MveraJ points on th^ river. To-mor
row the Senator, with Lieutenant Gov
ernor Alden Anderson. State Senator
B. F. Rush ;:n<l Assemblyman F. W.
Devlin, will visit the navy yard at
Mare Island. The citizens of Vallejo
tpprlscd of tlie f;u-t that strong
Influences have been brought to bear
i" Washington to diminish the allow
ance for the equipment of the Mare
Island yard. It is expected that the
Sen;itor-o)<'Â« t will acquire much use
lul knowledge by his inspection of the
Government plant and will be able to
convince his fellow Senators that the
danger of the water shoaling there is
not in any sense alarming.
It is probable that Senator Flint will
visit the Oakland estuary and also in
spect the defenses of San Francisco
harbor before leaving this region of
thf State for his home in Los Angeles.
State Senator E. F. Woodward was

the city for Sacramento during the

BANZAIS RING
FOR THE EMPIRE
Japanese Residents of City
Celebrate Accession of
'linmu as Nation's Head
ALHAMBKA IS CROWDED
Addresses, Songs and Music
stir the Little Brown
31 en in Their Patriotism
Alhambra Theater rang with joyous
banzals last night, for the Japanese
residents of San Francisco who had
gathered there to celebrate the 2565 th
anniversary of the accession of Em
peror Jinmu could not restrain their
exultation in the achievements of their
nation and the triumphs of arms on
land and soa in the present conflict of
the Far East.
The spacious auditorium was crowd
ed. Enthusiasm was at high pitch, for
there is nothlnÃ that the little brown
men rejoice in more than the glory won
i by their native land. At lnter%-als in the
' programme there were calls from the
platform for cheers for the Emperor
and for other patriotic sentiments.
From 1500 throats â¦ame the responses
lustily.
The Japanese is proud that Emperor
Mutsuhito can trace his lineage di
rectly to Jinmu, the founder of the Em
pire. Mutsuhito is the one hundred and
twenty-second ruler of the dynasty,
and his hold on the affections ot his
people is marked.
The Alhambra shone in new dress
for the occasion. The Japanese flag
was draped everywhere and the decora
tions helped in the patriotic demonstra
tion. K. Kurozawa was the chairman,
and in opening remarks told of the sig
nificance of the assemblage and the
good reasons all Japanese had for pride
in their country since Port Arthur fell.
A band discoursed music and then the
audience sang the national hymn,
"Kimigayo." The reading by G. Ikeda
of the Emperor's proclamation of war
against Russia provoked much hand
rlapping. Addresses followed by Dr.
H. B. Johnson, K. Kiyose, Dr. Sturge
and K. Uyeno. who is the local Consul
for Japan.
Next came a call for banzais for the
Emperor and the army and navy of
Japan. The cheers were rafter-ringing.
Children who are attending the public
schools of the city sang songs of the
founding of the empire, of Emperor
Jinmu, of "MidMidori." the water bird,
and of Tokimuni, the great warrior.
A juvenile dance by Miss S. Ogawa,
to the measure of a poetic song of the
"Spring Rain," was highly entertain
ing, and a sword dance by R. Sunaba,
to a song of the snows in Manchuria,
that was full of contemporary signifi
cance, received no less applause.
A Japanese entertainment is not com
plete without an acrobatic perform
ance and this was given by the Tetsu
wari Company. The Shofudan Com- .
pany entertained very successfully in a j
one-act comedy, and after some more
hearty cheering the greatest demon- i
stration of Japanese patriotism ever
held in San Francisco was brought to a
close.
WILL SHORTEN TIME
TO YOSEMITE VALLEY
Santa Fc Negotiating With Sierra
Railway for Traffic Arrangements
by Way of Big Oak Flat.
It was reported yesterday on good
authority that the Santa Fe officials
were negotiating with the Sierra Rail
way for a traffic alliance that would
insure the former a new and quicker
route from this city into the Yosemite
Valley by way of Big Oak Flat. The
Santa Fe now connects with the Sier
ra Railway over the recently con
structed extension between Rlverbank
and Oakdale, which is controlled by
the Sierra Railway.
By that route it is purposed to nan -
die valley tourists via Chinese Camp,
from which point th^sierra Railway
Company will probably inaugurate a
stage service into the valley. If cite
deal ip carried out, as it is expected,
the service from San Francisco, to Yo
semite Valley will be cut to twenty
four hours.

ELECTION BOARD CASE
CLOSED BEFORE MAYOR
Findings Will Be Rendered on
Charges of Alleged Misconduct in
a Few Days.
Mayor Schmitz announced yester
day that he would take no further
testimony in the case of the Election
Commissioners whom he haled before
him on charges of misconduct in con
nection with the appointment of pre
cinct officers for the primaries held
last August. Attorney Cator, on be
half of the board, informed the Mayor
that he had no further evidence to
offer and the cace was formally closed.
The chief executive said he would ren
der his findings in a few days.
The hearing was held three weeks
ago and thorough inquiry was made
as to the acts of the Commissioners.
Mayor Schmitz desired to go into the
matter further, however, and has
twice postponed the case. It was his
desire to get all the facts on which
the Grand Jury based its accusations
against the board, which are now
pending in the courts, with a view to
summarily dismissing the members if
the evidence warranted such action.

ASKS SUPREME COURT
TO QUASH INDICTMENTS
F. A. Robinson Claims Grand Jury
of Merced County .Was Xot
Properly Drawn.
F. A. Robinson, who is on trial in
Merced County on the charge of col
lecting public money under false pre
tenses, applied to the Supreme Court
yesterday for an order prohibiting Su
perior Judge Rector from proceeding
with the case. The defendant alleges
that the Grand Jury which indicted
him was illegally drawn. The Su
preme Court has not yet taken any
action in the matter.
Robinson was superintendent of
construction of the new Merced Coun
ty Hospital. He was indicted on the
charge of collecting a salary without
performing the work for which he
was paid. This was in Merced Coun
ty, not at Sacramento. Six other pub
lic officials and ex-Supervisors were
indicted at the same time with Robin
son for alleged juggling with public
funds.
On motion of the Distric-t Attorney
nine men whose names were on the
panel were excused from grand jury
duty. A special venire was secured
before the inquisitorial body could be
formed. Robinson claims the nine
jurymen excused on motion of the Dis
trict Attorney were properly qualified
to serve and that therefore the indict
ment was illegal.
Chnrles L. Preston Dead.
Charles L. Preston died suddenly at
his residence, 791 Sutter street, Fri
day morning in the presence of his
wife. He had been in his usual good
health, with the exception of a cold,
which he contracted on Wednesday.
Mr. Preston arose about 8 o'clock and
did not complain of illness. He began
to shave and suddenly staggered and
reeled toward the bed. Mrs. Preston
half caught him in her arms as he
fell dead on the bed. Even then she
had no idea that the end had come to
her husband. Medical aid was called
only to pronounce life extinct.
Mr. Preston was 35 years of age, â¢
native of New York City. He married
a year and a. half ago. Tie was em
ployed by the New Amsterdam Cas
ualty Company, and was well known
in insurance circles, both in the East
avid West. His mother and two sisters,
who survive him, live in Kingston, N.
Y. Arrangements for the funeral will
not be decided upon until word has
been received from the family in New
York.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
AUBURX. Feb. 11.â The strain is be
ginning to tell on Adolph Weber. To
day. for the first time since the begin
ning of his trial on a charge of mur
dering his mother, he appeared ill at
ease. During the court proceedings his
nervousness was apparent to every one.
He was very thoughtful during both
..-"sessions of the court. He said nothing
to his attorneys except when they
asked him a question. While Adrian
"Wills, the friend who came to his re
lief on the ni^ht of the terrible ; : igedy
and took him to hi: home, was testify
ing Weber appeared much affected. He

plano-ed from one side of the court to ]

and otherwise showed that he was* not
as callous as ho wou'.d have it appear.
When Wills talked of hoy/ he and his !
family had oared for the defendant on [
ihe nijrht of the tragedy Weber's face j
flush' and he showed the greatest!
emotion he has Khovrn since the trial!
beisfun. At the end of the afternoon i
session he paid he felt "tired," but oth- !
erwise "all right." j
Henry Carr, the second-hand dealer j
who says he sold the revolver to!
Adoljih WTcber, was the first witness j
called at the opening of court. Attor- '
ney Johnson took him in hand at the
start and tried his best to show that
the witness was not worthy of ere- |
dene-. Oarr's books had arrived from :
. San Francisco and were in court. John-1
Bon attempted to trace from whom \
Carr ficd bought this weapon the!
pawnbroker says he sold to Weber. The !
books, however, did not give this infor- |
mation.
"Are you not out on bail on the ;
charge of having had a stolen United
States "revolver in your possession?"
Johitnon asked the witness.
OFMKCTIO.V m warn.
General Webb was "on his feet In an
Instant with an objection to the ques
tion. The Judge ordered the jury to re
tire from the courtroom, when Johnson
stated that he wanted, to it..v. the
witness had been violating: the ordin
ance of San Francisco and that his tes
timony was not entitled to any credit.
Johnson said the witness -knew; that he
had array weapons in his possession;
that no mention of the Government's
property was made because I 'a it knew
that the ofliceiP could walk in at any
time and take the /property without a
question. Johnson claimed the witness
kept a secret record of Government
property in his possession to evade the
law.
â¢"I want to show," said Johnson, "that
the evidence given by this man Carr is j
not worthy of â â¢â¢<"â¢"
The objection "was sustained. When
the jurymen had returned to the Jury
box Johnson asked the witness:
"Have you ever been promised any ,
reward for your testimony la this case,
or have you ever been promised any i
immunity of any kind?"
' "No." faid Carr. !
Attorney Tuttlr- here asked the wit- \

upon the wear>on by which he. could
Identify It The-witness said that there
â¢were se%'eral nicks on the barrel of the '
THE !#r CALL
gun and that the barrel itself was
shaky. To prove this statement Can
asked for the weapon. He showed that
,the barrel was loose and pointed out
the nicks.
Adrian Wills' testimony was the same
as Riven at the preliminary hearing. He
t')!d how he found Adolph under the
little magnolia tree in front of the
burTiing residence on the night of the
tragedy and how he went to him and
tied a handkerchief around his waist to
stop the Mood from flowing from a
wound in his hand.
Attorney Johnson made a great point
â of this portion of Wills' testimony. He
elicited from Wills the statement that
the blood was flowing very freely from
the wound and was ; running down
Adolph's fingers. He also obtained an
admission from Wills that "while there
were blood stains noticeable on Weber's
trousers while ( the wound was being
dressed at- the Wills' house, the witness
had noticed- no blood , stains upon
Adolph's trousers as he stood on the
steps of the Weber home â¢ during: the
fire.
STANDING UPON STEPS.
Wills said that when he first saw
Adolph at thp fire the boy was standing
upon th<' front steps. "Whether he was
tivii'K !< help carry the bodies down
the steps or trying to get out of the
way. I cannot say," said Wills.
F. K. Brye, A. S. Fleming, Chris Hen
ney. K. O. M< Kinstry and J. F. Bullard
each stated that they did not see young
Weber on or about the premises at the
time of the fire.
J. P. Schniziu*. railroad telegraph
operator here, stated that on the night
of the fire train M, known as the Colfax
local, arrived at the station at 6:46
o'clock. Th* operator's evidence waa
introduced to substantiate May Clark's
statement that about that time she had
seen Adolph Weber going past her resi
dence on Brewery lane on his way
down town.
The courtroom was crowded to irt ut
most capacity to-day, and about the
courthouse were lined up vehicles of all
kinds and descriptions, which had come
from all parts of the county bringing
people to hear the testimony.
Weber will appear in court at 1:30
o'clock on Monday to enter his plea to
the charge of having robbed the Placer
(â 'â¢unty Bank last July.
Chester Fowler, an old friend of
Weber, who is now residing in Oakland,
arrived here to-night, having been sum
moned by the defense by means of a
telegraphic subpena.
SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 12. 1905.
Judge Prewett stated this afternoon
that the prosecution probably would
have all their witnesses in by Monday
night, and that the witnesses of the
defense would be through by Wednes

fense will try to impeach the testimony
of May Clark and George Ruth.

Takes Slap at Supervisor*.
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
criticized the Board of Public Works
because of failure to comply with an
ordinance directing that Mission street
between Onondaga and Porter ave
nues be paved with asphalt. The
matter came up when the new speci
fications for an asphalt pavement on
the street named were being consid
ered. Commissioner Eagan took ex
ception to the direction of the Board
of Supervisors that asphalt be used
and ridiculed the adoption of the bi
tuminous rock specifications in the
same ordinance. The Board of Works
then passed a resolution adopting
asphalt specifications and requesting
the Board of Supervisors for author
ity to expend the sum of ) 80,000 ap
propriated in the municipal budget
for the imnrovement. This will force
the Board of Supervisors to pass a
new ordinance ordering the improve
ments described.
Nerd Not Give Transfers.
The Supreme Court decided yester
day that the Pacific Electric Railway
Company and the Los Angeles Rail
way Company were not compelled ac- !
cording to the terms of their fran- !
chlses to issue transfers at the inter- j
section of their lines on East Ninth !
Bireet in the southern city mentioned. '
The franchise for the East Ninth
street line carried with it a liability
in the matter of giving transfers, but
the road changed hands several times;
so the court thinks that as most of the
advantages of the franchise have been
lost, the new owners of the property
need not shoulder the responsibility of
accepting all the disadvantages. j
TO BEGIN WORK
AT CITY HALL
Foreman Andrews Orders
His Committees to Investi
gate Municipal Affairs
STILL SEEKING LAWYER
Civil Service Board Rakes
Statement That Reflects
on Judge and Attorneys
Foreman Andrews has directed th,e
various committees of the Grand Jury
to begin investigation of the respective
municipal departments to which he as
signed them. The foreman spent sev
eral hours yesterday in the offices of
the Department of Public Works going
over records and looking into the con
duct of the business.
The Grand Jury Is slill seeking an at
torney who is keen and without strong
political affiliations to act as special
prosecutor for it and take hold of the
cases that come under investigation.
â¢Since Francis J. Hem-} and Supervisor
Brandenstein refused to accept the job
it has been offered to J. J. Dwyer, John
A. Lei man. Isidore Harris, the Assist
ant District Attorney, and others.
Harris is the latest man to come un
uer consideration, and Foreman An
drews hopes he will accept. Harris is
willing* but it is understood that Dis
trict Attorney E\ington does not wish
him tv leave his office.
Among the other departments that
have already received the attention of
the Grand Jui-y fcg th^ Civil Service
Commission. The inquiry was made
pointedly why certain branches of the
municipality were not brought within
civil service. Then was revealed a con
dition of affairs that opened the eyes
of the grand jurors. Injunctions issued
by the Superior Court, it was learned,
have tied the hands of the board, .and
a strange phase of the situation is that
the suits have been hanging in the
courts for two years ov more without
any effort on the nart of the City and
County Attorney or the court to have
them cleared away.
BOARD BLAMES Ml HASRV.
The commission prepared a written
statement of the facts, offering no crit
icism directly, but freeing their own
shoulders of the responsibility. In ihe
communication to the Grand Jury the
board sets- forth that the Injunction
sued out Dy T. P. Monlle "to" restrain
holding of the examinations for patrol
wagon and ambulance drivers on
March 17, 190:5, is still ponding before
Judge Murasky. As a matter of fact,
the commission has been "enjoined since
November, 1902. as to these examina
tions, because one Conisto'rk then pro
cured a writ, and as soon a? his case
was thrown out of court for the reason
that he was disqualified from bringing
action Moulle instituted his suit.
The Commissioners exhibit a letter
they wrote to Judge Murasky asking
him to make some disposition of the
case. This step was somewhat bold
and unusual, for litigants are not gen
erally regarded as having the right to
address a Judge with a view to have
him hasten the judicial process. Bui
the Commissioners say the exigencies
of the situation justified them in such
a course, for in their opinion Judge Mu
raeky was unwarrantably dilatory. No
reply was forthcoming from him, how-
It appears, furthermore, according to
the report of the Civil Bervtce Commis
sion that Judge Murasky had dissolved
the injunction, but when they began to
prepare for holding the examinations
he granted an order vacating the dis
solution. The case was set for hearing,
and at this point the City and County
Attorney comes in as a factor in de
feating the plans of the board to exam
ine the applicants.
ATTOKXKY NEGIiItiENT.
The Judge once more issued an in
junction, and in his opinion said that
his reason for doing so was that tho
atorney for the municipality failed to
fill? his reply brief. Thus the City and
County Attorney is put in the light of
having neglected the case and thereby
nullified the efforts of the commission
to place the drivers in the police and
hospital departments under civil ser
vice rule.
Again, the Commissioners set forth
in their statement to the Grand Jury j
that the Macomber injunction prevent
ing them from holding examinations
for linemen, repairers and battery men
In the Department of Electricity has
been stricken from the calendar in
Judge Slosb' court through want of at
tention by the attorneys. The City At- j
torney has taken no steps to have the
case disposed of, however, although
letters were sent to him repeatedly to
act in the matter. The examinations
that were restrained in this suit were set
for March 24, 1903.
The suit against the examinations for |
street sweepers was instituted August 1
4. 1904, and is now submitted on briefH
before Judge Sloss.
Copies of. . the ' letters that the Civil
Service Commission has sent to the City
and County Attorney and to Judge Mu
arsky have been given to the Grand i
Jury. The Commissioners feel that no j
blame can attach to them for delays in '
extending the civil service, and to their i
own satisfaction have made it clear I
that the responsibility rests chiefly)
with the City and County Attorney and
with Judge Murasky.
Court Reverses Itself.
In a suit brought by the Valley
Lumber Company agaisnt P. a. Struck
to foreclose a mechanic's lien, the Su
preme Court yesterday decided in fa
vor of the defendant. The lower court
decided in favor of the plaintiff and
the Supreme Court originally con
curred in that judgment, but a re
hearing was granted and the State's
highest tribunal reverses itself. â¢

APPEALTO LEGISLATURE
Will Urge Postponement of
Amendment Which Will
Eeduce City's Ec venue
The Supervisors' Finance Committee
yesterday held a conference with rep
resentatives of the Merchants' Asso
ciation to arrange, if possible, for op
position to the bill now before the
Legislature changing the State's ap
portionment of school funds to the
various counties, which \viil result in
a loss of 5356.0 Mm the school revenue
oÂ£ San Francisco. Besides th? mem
bers of the committee, there were pres
ent Superintendent of Schools Lang
tl'>n. School Director Roncovieri. Frank
SVn.me?. president of the Merchants'
Association; Fairfax Wheelan and
others.
It was explained that the proposed
i Pliortionment was based un the en
rollment of pupils instead >t the num
ber of school rewraa children. Fairfax
Whoelan contended that this was the
toadeal plan, as it meant pay only for
services rendered.
Symmes, said that this city con
tributes n,H2,tM yearly to the support,
of the State schools and recetred
jOO less than that amunt bi'ck. *
"We contribute 2Â£> per cent to the
support of other schools. ' said
Syn.nvF. "and the new pian would
compel us to contribute 50 per cent,
which, i think, would be an injustice."
Wlteelan disclaimed any intention of
iiijurins the interests of the local
schools, but thought that the entire
State should be consulted.
I.anÂ£don said there were cousKsW*
tior.s in the matter of service, inas
much as San Francisco has more
school days in its course than other
counties.
"That the proposed measure was not
just and fair was ably shown by
School Superintendent Keppel or" LO3
Angeles," said Lanjdoiv " but he sub
stituted another plan, which was mu-h
worse for San Francisco, as it w ould
red'.iee the revenue by $150,000 in
of s:"",!"^. As it is exceedingly diffi
cult to dfvis* a plan that would be
Hinitabie, we have suggested tha.
tion on any measure at all be post
poned for two years, and in the mean
time the subject can be thoroughly
threshed out by the hold-over Sen
ators, the Governor and edttcaltonal
officials, forming a commission for the
l>urp"s.-. The present method has been
in use since Hit* and has been pro
nounced a success by educators."
"The question is purely one of tax
ation." said Chairman Brandenstein.
Symmes thought thaf there should
be no radical change in the method,
but it snould be gradual, so the city
( ould adapt itself to the chanced con
ditions. Tt was then decided that rep
resentative? ol the Merchants' Asso
ciation shall appear, with the local
school officials, before the Legislature
next Tuesday and endeavor to have tbe
apportionment delayed for two years â
or at least one year.
The committee called attention to
other measures now before the Legisla
ture which it regarded as an infringe
ment on the city's right to manage its
own affairs, notably the proposed in
crease in the Fire Department, which
will entail an additional expenditure
of $500,000.

if I had pcotf ed my asphalt from.

Monet resented this intimation, sav
ins that it was not founded on fact.
Mr. McDonald is selfish about these
matters," said Money, "and wants to
have things all his own way. We are
not favoring any particular paving ma
terial, nor any firm handling the same."
McDonald retorted that the knÃt
ing Department was tryins tv discredit
bitumen as a paving material by per
mitting it? pi-cparation to be slighted SS
that the bitumen aid not wear m

DANSEUSE MAKES A HIT
AND RIVALS WRITHE.
They Purloin One of Her
Clogs and Also Abuse Her
TRIUMPHAL AUTO TOUR ENDS ROUGHLY
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Professional jealousy was alleged to
have been carried to the extreme in the
persecution of Miss Alice Wainwright,
clog and soft shoe dancer, who was at
tired in automobiling raiment as she
stood before' P.olice Judge Mogan and
pleaded not guilty of disturbing the
peace of the Barbary Coast at 1 o'clock
yesterday morning. Codefendant with
Miss Wainwrighl was C. F. Truesdell.
a bWtender, and he, too, denied the
charge that he had routed quietude
from the place and at the time men
tioned. The arresting policeman testi
fied that the defendant? and two w6m
en, who had vanished ere he could cap
ture them, were fiercely battling, and
Miss Wainw right s nose was scratched
; and bleeding. (Facial disfigurement
! glanced at and mentally noted by the
i bench.)
j Then' came the defense. ' By conscien-
I tious and painstaking artistic endeavor
; Miss Wainwright had established' for
| herself , 5 a most enviable standing in
j North End vaudeville circles. r Her act
I was in demand by an appreciative pub-
I lie and managers clamored' for her ser
; vices. So when she was. advertised to
â  make her : first appearance upon J the
; stage of a certain concert hall in the
: Latin district last Friday night 1 - the
[^clientele of the house rallied with * un
precedented numerical strength, to the
I extreme gratification of the impresario
i who had engaged her and .to/the great
displeasure of those performers whom
she threatened to eclipse in magnetism.
Unscrupulous spitework of the latter
' underlay the fight that resulted in her
i arrest. She was billed to open her
"turn" by dancing a "pedestal clog,"
â¢ but one of her clogs was surreptitiously
| removed from her dressing-room, and
: consequently she was compelled to sub
i stitute a soft-shoe jig, announced by;
| the stage* manager as "Miss Alice
! Wainwright's terrific hit, entitled foot
: steps in the sand." So nimbly and
i gracefully did she trip the lively meas
j ure that the spectators - rose en , masse
|in admiration and freighted the air
i with floral tributes, shouts of "Go it,
kiddoh!" and "Oh. you. Alice!" Old
patrons of the place averred that never
i in its history had pedal talent provoked
such an ovation. - : '.
After the performance Miss Wain
wright found an automobile occupied
by Mr. Truesdell awaiting her at the
' stage entrance, and in the vehk'le she
' made a triumphant ' tour of the Bar
| bary Coast, occasionally halting to re
i ceive congratulations and reward the
! bestov.ers : thereof with liquid offerings.
! It. was at the intersection of Jackson
i and Kearny streets that the first un
; pleasantness occurred. While auto
i mobile was stationary two of Miss
j Wainwright's disgruntled feminine
â  stage associatesâ probably (he pilferers ,
lof her missing clog â suddenly ap- j
i peared' and with) . tongues and fists j
abused her, and when Mr. Truesdell at
tempted to protect her he, too, was sub
jected to oral and corpora! chastise-
I ment by them. Patrolman Nelson's ar
rival scared away the assailants and j
probably saved the assailed from fatal i
injury, ; for so infuriated were the j
former that, their blows 'were heavy, as j
Miss ' Wainwright's lacerated; nose
would silently testify. .' '
The case was continued to afford the
policeman opportunity to produce the
two combatants who fled at his ap
proach. .â '-.;. :'..;'-â â  â  ;

No sooner had Judge Mogan sen
tenced Miss Jessie Bell, accused of dis
orderly behavior at Ellis and Taylor
streets, than a young woman friend of
the defendant hastened to the corridor
and said in loud tone to a feminine
group:
"What lo you think of that? Sixty
. days for Jess, and her hair starting to
go back: Gawd knows what she'll look
- Mko when she comes out of jail."
The ensuing murmur . ot "Mer-cy"

Another sweet singer. Patrolman
Mitchell, posed in Judge Mogans court,
but as a complainant. He drove home
! a charge of selling liquor without li
cense, the defendant being J. W.
Knight of 2841 Greenwich street. It
1 bsirfg contrary to law to sell or give
1 away intoxicating beverages within a
! certain distance of the Presidio reser
1 vation, and Mr. Knight's place of busi
ness being fairly within the prescribed
district, and Patrc-lman Mitchell being
suspicious that Mr. Knight was ignor
ing the prohibition, the case's cause of
being needs no further elucidation. But
! the aianner of Patrolman Mitchell's
procedure is worthy of extended notice.
Rightly conjecturing that it would be
I futile for a person clothed in police uni
| form to attempt to buy liquor from Mr.
Knight, and knowing that would-be
purchasers in civilian attire were also
distrusted by that gentleman, the of
ficer borrowed an army uniform, as- j
snmed a military strut and a dashing,
semi-drunken air. visited the Knight
establishment and called for a drink.
The liquor, however, did not material-;
ize as quickly as it was ordered. ~and !
the tardiness of its arrival convinced j
the sleuth that he was suspected. Then
he started to "make good" his simu
lated character. Possessor of an excel
lent voice, he began, to sing, hoping
thereby to banish any doubt as to his I
purpose that Mr. Knight might enter- j
tain â for who had ever heard of a pro- i
fessional detective singing, or even at- j
tempting to sing, while in performance j
of his duty Ere the first verse of "Only |
a Soldier Boy" was concluded there was i
palpable change in Mr. Knight's de- !
meanor, and when that pathetic ballad ;
gave way to the more rousing melody !
of "Hark. 'Tis the Drum"!" the host
was fumbling with glassware. Then
back to pathos went the vocalist, pour- ;
ing all the sentiment of his soui into j
"Good-by, Little Girl. Good-by," and â¢
as the final prolonged strain died away
Mr. Knight was shedding tears and
drawing beer.
After that there was no misgiving in
the mind of the 'blind pig" manager.
Songs and drinks alternated until the
pseudo soldier fearrd that if he swal
lowed any more evidence he would be
incapable of official action, so he simul
taneously stopped the flow of beer and
the outpouring of voiced melody by dis
closing his identity and placing Mr.
Knight under anpst, much to that per
son's sorrow, surprise and anger.
The defense will be heard next Fri
day.

"Has he done anything wrong since

SUICIDE THEORY
WELL GROUNDED
Soldiers Finc^l ?stol Under
Plank in ti,f rave Where
Herbert Smith Was Shot
LANDLOBD SAW WEAPON
Wounded Man, However.
Makes Strong Denial That
He Fired to Take Own Life
The revolver with which Herbert
Smith, baker, is supposed to have been
shot, was recovered by soldiers yester
day afternoon from the cave in which
the man had remained in a wounded
condition nearly ninety hours. The po
lice are ipclined to adhere to the theory
of attempted suicide, but the shell from
which the bullet that entered Smith's
head was fired is missing.
Smith was discovered in an appar
ently dying condition by soldiers from
Fort Miley Friday afternoon. He was
found in a cave near Lands End, with
a bullet hole in his head and a badly
discolored eye. The wounded man was
at once taken to the Fort Miley Hospi
tal, and when he was sufficiently re
vived he made a statement that he had
been in the rocky rece3s since last
Tuesday afternoon. During this time
he had been without food or water and
In a condition of semi-consciousness. In
accounting for his predicament. Smith
says that while enjoying a walk on the
beach he was held up by two men and
when he resisted one of the robbers
shot him in the head. He says he was
robbed of 122 and dragged to the cave,
where he was left for dead.
Detectives Silvey and Coleman took
charge of the case as soon as it was re
ported to police headquarters and spent
yesterday in an investigation. They
learned that Smith was an ex-soldier
and a recent arrival from England. He
had been employed for a short time in
a local bakery. He resided with the
family of Robert Collins at 928 Jackson
street and left his room during Tuesday
morning for the purpose of visiting the
Cliff House and beach. He was met at
the beach soon after 1 o'clock in the
afternoon by an acquaintance, Albert
Howeth. and when the two parted
Smith said that he was about to visit
Sutro gardens.
Yesterday afternoon Sergeant King
and Private Paul Ament of the Twen
ty-fifth Coast Artillery searched the
cavt^for the pistol. Nothing was found
in the pan of the cave where Smith
was lying when discovered, but in the
back of the cave some distance from
the entrance the weapon was brought
to light from beneath a plank. It was a
cheap pistol and contained only three
unexploded cartridges. The mystery
is what became of the empty shell
from which the bullet that may have
injirred Smith was fired. It could not
be found in the vicinity, but an expert
on revolvers told the detectives he is
certain rrie weapon had been recently
discharged.
Robert Collins, with whom Smith
has been living, says that Smith had
a pistol. Smith denies this and says
that he possessed no firearms of any
sort since he was discharged from thie
British army, in which he served in
South Africa during the Boerv war.
Collins thinks that Smith had a re
volver wrapped up in an old sweater,
but he is not prepared to swear that
the one found in the cave is the same
weapon. Smith scoffs the idea of
suicide, but the detectives are con
vinced that he attempted to take his
own life. He says that he inteuded*o
ship for Liverpool within a few days
and had no reason to wish to die. The
patient has been removed to the Cen
tral Emergency Hospital and from
present indications will survive his in
juries.

While to-day's game was a clean de
feat for Stanford, the team showed a
noticeable Improvement over former
contests. Best of all was the awaken
ing of the cardinal sluggers. Although
there were only rive hits made, thes â¢
were clean bingles and every man hit
the ball on the nose, V?nt Cutter,
Chase' and Emerson, who pitched for
the professionals, kept the hits scat

danger of the cardinals overtaking the
professionals' early lead.
Before the game began Coach Con -

Colbert, last year's first baseman on
the varsity, was moved to second.

changed to left field and Chalmers
covered right field. These changes
seemed to improve the fielding of the

Walter Jennings' great mare Dainty,
carrying 124 pounds and ridden by -'Big
Bill" Knapp. was b<ja.ten a nose on the
wire by Horatius. from the stable of
Skinner & Co., with Minder in the sad
dle, for the valuable Palace Hotel
handicap yesterday at Oakland track.
The aristocratically bred Honiton,
:ak^r for tht- greater portion of
the mile and a furlong journey, finished
a snug third, only half a length behind
the two leadt :
It was the first time since the incep
f the racing season that the cli

Fuperb weather and the prospect of
once more seeing the horses race over a

was enthroned favorite at 6 to 5.
â MUSICS A GOOD BET.
Horatius. with 106 pounds to nego
looked a plausible betting propo
and from 3^2 the odds fell to 16

astride Horatius,
'jawling up. and sat flown to ride in

Horatius. which looked beaten at the

from the wire Knapp drew his whip,

end as Dainty swerved opposite the
jockey board Horaiius forged up on
f-ven terms. As the wire was passed
the judj^s saw his nose first.
HOMTO.VS GREAT EFFORT.
Honiton handled her 119 pounds
splendidly, being lapped on the leaders
and a keen contender. The time of the
race was 1:53 Vi â excellent perform
ance when it Is considered that the
track was not at its best. The stake
was worth $Â£9SO, of whicb $1380 went
to the first horse.
Favorites fared none too well, Da- !
ruma and Dr. L<eggo being the only
ones to score. The bookmakers did a
land office business.

seemed a trifle too far and
the company too f=picy. Bell upset
th^e prognostications by leading from

-asily from Sol Lichtenstein, a 10 to

ing a well-rounded turn of speed, lost
I ace by half a length. Best Man,
the favorite, couldn't scare up a gallop.
BLCTE PAIR FAVORITKS.
Two chances to cash caused the
Blutf pair, Tim Hurst and Tramotor,
<-d, to be installed favorite for the
Futurity course purse event. There
was so much Sad Sam money in sight,
however, that the half breed later on
supplanted the entry, his price being
i down from 2 1 *, to 8 to 5. As
usual. Sam outbroke his field, starting
off with tht ntentions. All

leader, and in a driving finish beat him
nearly a length. The show went to Mrs.
Eckert'B Rector. Tim Hum and Tram

start. v
Hainault didn't even get a piece of
the crust in the mile and a sixteenth
p affair, for which he ruled an 8 to
...rite. Second turning into the
stretch to Cincinnatus, the gelding be
jran fading away and finished fourth.
Stilicho, an 8 to 1 chance, well ridden
right, came with a cyclonic rush,

TRACK NOTES.
Minder and Bonner each piloted
two winners.
Like W. R. Condon, winner of the
Burns handicap, Horatius was claimed
from a selling race.
Frank Skinner, part owner of Hora
tius, celebrated the occasion by send
ing up a few bottles of the vintage to
the boys in the press stand. Long live
Herat! us!
It is a strange coincidence that the
only two successful public choices, Da
n;ma and Dr. Leggo, were both bred
at the Napa Stock Farm and each
closed at odds of 9 to 20, according
to the official form chart.
Last year Napa Stock Farm had
the crack filly Arisbe and this season
Daruma has all of the fillies up her
sleeve.
If "Big Bill" Knapp, on Dainty, had
saved some ground on the stretch turn
the result of the stake race might have
been different.
In some inexplicable manner G. W.
Trahern snapped his left hind leg at
the pastern joint and had to be de
stroyed. Only a short time ago Sum
mers & Co. refused an offer of $2500
for the gelding.
Starter Dick Dwyer's work with the
barrier was a pleasant feature of the
afternoon's sport.
Press reports sent out would convey
the impression that rain would cause
no mud at the New Orleans race
track. The winners* time In the open
ing handicap, at a mile, yesterday was
1.53 1-5. That reads like mud.
Julius Fleischman, Mayor of Cincin
nati and one of the stewards of the

the end of their last contest made the
patrons of the fighting game clamor
for another match and Greggalna was
successful in signing the men for his
main event.
Ah Wing, the "mixing Mongolian,"
will be another stellar attraction at
the club'B show. This time his oppo

better boy than Torres, who waa de
feated by Wing's pivot blow. They
clash at 118 pounds.
Leo Marsh and Fred Lang, two
heavies of promise, will also be seen
in a special bout. Their try-out proved
them to be surprisingly fast arid clev

Four excellent ring warmers have
been arranged between Harry Riley
and Gus Salid at 145 pounds; Charlie
Dunn and George Ellis at 135; Harry

The colors of the Lowell High
School baseball team were rudely
hauled down and trampled to the limit
by the Commercial School balltossers
at Golden Gate Park yesterday after
noon. The game was exciting in parts,
but both teams showed the lack of
team work and committed many
blunders.
The Commercials practically broke
up the game In the first round, when
Roncovieri's icecream wing refused to
thaw out. In a twinkling the bases
were filled and then the runs began to
come through. A couple of hits, aided

man tells the tale 6t the five runs for
the Commercials.
Lowell came back with two In her
part of the same spasm, but not for
six more rounds could they wallop
Dougherty's benders. During the
seventh the Lowells began to rally a bit
and hammered four rounds through.
They quit a bit too soon, however, and
failed to keep up the sprint in the
ninth. The teams lined up as follows:

MANY ATHLETES
ARE TRAINING
University of California
Will Be Well Represented
in Competition This Year
DATES ARE SELECTED
Intercollegiate Field Day
and Eegatta Will Be
Decided on April 15
BERKELEY, Feb. 11. â Spring
sports at the University of California
include boating, baseball, track ath
letics and rifle shooting and the dev
otees of each are hard at work pre
paring for contests in which the crack
men of the colleges will compete with
Stanford and other institutions for
honors.
Those in charge of the sporting ac
tivities have decided that the date of
the intercollegiate field day and boat
race shall be the same. On the morn
ing of April 15 the boating crews will
compete, while the field and track
men struggle for honors during the
afternoon of the same day.
The new racing shell ordered by the
Boating Association from Cornell Uni
versity has arrived and will be put
into action at once. The men who
are candidates for the. coveted seats
in the shell have begun work, trying
out for the positions on the crew. G.
J. Anloff, chairman of the committee
in charge of the try-outs, has accept
ed the names of fifteen freshmen who
are anxious to compete for places on
the crew, and these men are being
given practice work.
Professor Magee has announced
that he is prepared to give special
work in his department of physical
culture to twenty-four men until the
15th lnst., when all men who have
signed up will be excused for the rest
of the term. Last year the freshmen
beat Stanford, and Anloff thinks he
can duplicate the feat this year. All
freshmen who make the crew will re
ceive their class numerals. As there
are two vacancies In the varsity crew
there will be a chance for the pick of
the freshmen to make their big "C's."
The Lippy trophy cup, won from
Washington by the boating crew last
year, has finally come to Manager De
coto. It is on exhibition in the co
operative store on the campus.
The importance of track athletics is
vouched for by Professor George C.
Edwards, chaivman of the faculty com
mittee on athletics, who declared re
cently that they are more important
than fcotball. He said football is a
fine sport, but field day athletics per
mits of the combination of athletes'
interests, all for the glory of the uni
versity, and so deserves a great* deal
of attention.
There is no lack of interest in the
preparations for selecting a team of
athletes to compete with Stanford on
track and field. More than 100 men
have signed for track work. The list
includes many freshmen, who will be
excused from gymnasium work after
the 15th inst. Every event has a fine
lot of candidates marked off for trial
work. The track is in use each after
noon by varsity men and the field is
dotted with figures, lightly clad, en
gaged in hurdling, pole vaulting, shot
putting and jumping.
Competition for places on the base
ball team of the varsity is keen, de
spite the fact that nearly all the po
feitions are sure to be given to veterans,
who were on the victorious team
against Stanford last year. The nine
showed up well against St. Mary's last
Wednesday, and, though defeated by
a score of 3 to 2, satisfied Coach Wil
liams that there is the making of a
champion team in the rinaterial he has
in hand. Captain Heitmuller is in
good form and getting better and is
expected to do the bulk of the box
work, Streub having broken his
finger. '
Five freshmen are trying for outfield
positions. There are eight of last
year's nine back on the field, and these
will make up the infield and battery,
with one of the "vets" in the out
field.
Negotiations are under way for a
match between the university rifle
team and Company D, Fifth Regiment,
N. G. C, of San Rafael. The match

Against San Francisco
Men on Presidio Links
The team' of the Claremont Country
Club gained an advantage of seven
points in the first half of the thirty-six
hole home-and-home golf match played
on the Presidio links yesterday against
the representatives of the San Fran
cisco Golf and Country Club.
In four of the matches neither player
gained an advantage over his opponent,
John Lawson finishing all even with E.
R. Folger, C. E. Maud with F. Kales,
B. D. with J. A. Folger and
Dr. J. R. Clark with R. M. Fitzgerald.
Six Claremont men and two San Fran
cisco players beat their opponents.
The method of scoring was different
from that hitherto adopted in the inter
club tournaments here. In order to pre
vent the possibility of a player In either
team scoring heavily against his op
ponent it wjas arranged that a match
won one up should score one point,
every hole to the good thereafter add
ing half a point, so that a player win
ning five up would score three points.
Six of the Claremont representatives
won their matches, the total of points
being 11%, while two of the San Fran
cisco golfers defeated their opponents,
scoring 4% points, the balance in favor
of Claremont being 7 points.
The second half of the match will be
played on the Claremont course on Sat
urday, the 25th inst., the results of the
two days' play being reckoned together.
The Presidio course was In excellent
condition, the fair green being well
turfed and the putting greens fast and
true. John Lawson was driving and
approaching in fine form, but/was weak
in his play on the green. Frank Kales
of the Claremont team made a good
start by taking the first hole from his
formidable opponent, C. E. Maud. He
thereby gained confidence that stood
him in good stead. Had the score been
reckoned by holes in the usual way the
Claremont team would have gained a
lead of ten up. The details of the match
