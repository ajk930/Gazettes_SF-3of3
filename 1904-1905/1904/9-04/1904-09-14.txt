An inspection of the vessel yesterday
by Captain John K. Bulger, local in
spectofyof hulls and boilers, made at
the instance ,of Collector of the Port
F. S. Stratton, resulted in a report to
Washington that coincided with the re
port of the examination Admiral Good
rich's engineer made the day before.
The Â¦ admi raL proceeded ; on his /own re
sponsibility and was . therefore more
prompt in ordering an; Investigation
than was Collector Stratton, who took
no stej> ; until..' advised by , the Depart
ment of. Commerce and Labor. â¢ -.-' ,
The boilers at present in the ship
and duplicates of which Captain Ber
linsky expected to find in San Fran
cisco are of the Belleville type and are
manufactured in England. There are
no Belleville boilers hero and it would
take from four to eight months. to have
shipment made from England and the
neyr ones, Installed.
Furthermore, Captain Berlinsky ar
rived in San Francisco almost without
coal, "notwithstanding his representa
tions to the . contrary. There is- not
near enough coal in the . bunkers I to
make the voyage to the nearest Rus
sian port. All in, all, the Russian war
ship was hard driven when she came
seeking the friendly offices of a neu
tral port, only to have hopes . of " aid
in ! her sorry plight dashed to the
ground. . â¢
The inspections of the vessel directed
by both Admiral Goodrich and Col
lector of the Port Stratton have re
vealed that not one of the twenty-four
boilers of the cruiser is in a serviceable
condition. The tubes are spotted with
accumulations of salt where the leaks
have been, handicapping the progress
of the ship. Each boiler has 162 tubes
and out of the total number there are
just enough .whole tubes to put eight
of the boilers in a sea-going condition.
But to take, out the tubes that' are
whole ana with them replace the de
fective 'tubes in order that the ship
might proceed with a third of her com
plement of, boilers so as to reach the
nearest Russian port i would require
thirty days' time, according to the esti
mate of Captain John K. Bulger, whose
report was forwarded to Washington
by Collector. Stratton yesterday;, and
six weeks according to the report Ad
miral Goodrich made to the Navy De
partment. ,
. The. mystery of the. mission Â¦ of ; the
Russian â¢ auxiliary ! cruiser Lena Â«to the
port' of San Francisco has been solved.
Captain Berlinsky came 4000 miles over
the ocean in quest of a new set of
boilers, for leaking of tubes told him
that the 'seaworthiness of the vessel
Was -seriously endangered. He has
failed in his 'purpose, the laws of neu
trality being given stern .interpretation
by the United States Government, and
the war craft must now be dismantled
and laid up till the conflict in the Far
East is ended.

Jesse Beard. 15 years old, who was
brought into the Juvenile Court in
March by his mother, Mrs. Matilda
Beard of 652 Arch street, was charged
with being incorrigible. He had been
away from home five days and the
mother and sister of the boy thought
that he should be-put in some'institu
tion where he could be managed.
Pending an investigation by the court,
Mrs. Helep W. Rogers, chief probation
officer, and others of the court con
ceived the idea that a physical defect
was responsible for the lad's mental
attitude. Â¦ The mother and sister then
remembered a fall received by the boy
when three years old. His head had
struck on a rock in a, stream where he
was wading. Dr. Kohlmer's examina
tion showed a concave formation of the
skull, where it should have been con
vex. Arrangements for an operation
were : made, but they were not carried
out until July 5, as the' boy had run
away in the meantime.'
The' operation ; by* Dr. Kohlmer-in
volved'the removal of three pieces of
the skull, on the under "side of which
he found thick growths pressing
against the brain.- ,
The boy was allowed to leave the
hospital fourteen days later, as well
and strong as ever, but showing a re
markable difference in his manner. The
old surliness and ungovernable temper
were gone and he was perfectly amen
able to the wishes of his mother.
The mind of the boy was cleared and
he seems extremely bright. It is be
lieved that he will rapidly advance in
school and make up for worthless
years. He understands what has oc
curred to him and says he is very
thankful to the court and to the doc
tor.. He will enter a special School in
connection with the Shortridge High
School, maintained for truants and
backward students, this week. The boy
has not been in school for three years
because of his. incorrigibility and at
the time he was taken out of school
he had reached only the second gradeâ
a class of boys eight years "old.

northeast of this city, on the American
River, burned to the ground about 8
o'clock this evening-
Engineer Lester, carrying a lighted
candle, entered the distillery to inspect
a tank of high proof brandy. Owing to
the warm weather of the past few days
the evaporation had been great, and
the fire from the candle Ignited the
Erases. An explosion followed, in which
the engineer was severely burned., He
fell to the engine-room below and was
also badly injured by the fall. The
flames spread to the fermenting plant,
thence to the winery building. The en

the Prince's condition was hopeless and

Prince Herbert Bismarck's condition is

Lachman's stand in favor of Califor

and settled the point regarding labels.
The concession was made to Califor
nia that as long as the wines bearing
typical French labels Â¦â¢ also bore the
name California so prominently that
there could be no possible deception
they could be entered in. competition.
The jurors finished their work well
satisfied and showed utter impartiality
in dealing with : Calif ornia. Among the
Frenchmen on the; jury are men known
throughout, the world in the wine trade.
They are Calve and Guestten, two of

Henry Lachman, the juror from San

A long conference was held immediate
ly after his arrival between some of the
French jurors, Superintendent Haber

Lachman. Many points of dispute were
amicably settled. >
ST. LOUIS, Â¦ Sept. 13.â The interna
tional jury on wines finished testing the
vintages of California this aftei-noon.
The members were, busily at work all
day yesterday and most of to-day on
the wines of the Golden State. From all
indications California wine producers
have cause to feel jubilant. It is felt
by those watching the interests of the
State that California will carry off
higher honors. than she has at any pre
vious exposition. They make this
statement directly. ,
A few days ago the situation looked
gloomy, and for a time there was a
possibility that California wines would
be withdrawn from competition alto
gether. The - old protest . of France
against wines of any other country
bearing the names of districts within
her borders that , had made her own
wines famous was renewed. The jury,
composed mostly of foreigners and
largely of Frenchmen, was in favor of
sustaining the protest.-

The x>dsse found the Indians still
plundering the stage and dividing the
loot, but being outnumbered the Mexi
can party at best could only beat back
the Yaquis and escape to San Marcial,
where a large posse was organized, set
out for the scene of the killing and re
covered the bodies of the dead.
Luis Estrella, Chief of Police of Car
bo, reached Hermosillo Sunday with a
ecore of prisoners taken after a fight
with the Yaquis between Carbo and
Rayon. Estrella used the Indians' own
tactics in pursuing them. He employed
Yaqui guides loyal to the Government
and succeeded in surrounding and de
feating them without losing a man, al
though seven Indians were killed in the
fight.
Twenty out of the twenty-five sur
vivors were captured. The leaders will
be executed and the remainder deport
td to Yucatan.
HERMOSILLO, Mexico, Sept 13.â
Mexican officials at the capital have
granted the request of the Ortiz La
Barranca stage line asking that the
road be patrolled to protect the lives of
passengers.
The request was made following a
second assault upon the La Barranca
stage by over fifty Yaqui Indians, who
killed Henry VL Martin, an American,
and four Mexican passengers. The
driver, who possessed neither arms nor
valuables, was allowed to escape, he
being a half-breed Yaqui.
Martin was superintendent of the San
Marcial coal mines. He and the Mexi
cans were mowed down by a shower of
bullets before they could make use of
the rifles with which they were armed.
The driver, who ran all the way to
Punta de Agua, gave the alarm, and
an armed posse was organized to ac
company the La Dura stage, which

Speaking of the two opposing candi
dates, he ridiculed the suggestion of an
"unsafe candidate," saying:
Unsafe! Who have been his advisers? Wno
stand as his supporters and admirers? Let
me name three of themâ three whom all men
honor, all men trustâ Elihu Root. John Hay,
William H. Taft. Is the man unsafe who se
lects such advisers?
If the voters of the country are earnestly
seeking an answer to the question as to which
of the great political, parties should receive
their support it is (surely to be found in the
history of the last twelve years. Twelve years
ago the Democratic party came into full power
in the Government. It proceeded at once to
put its policy into force and from that very
hour a blight fell upon tins nation. Crippled
business, vanishing opportunities, rising dis
content, impaired national credit, increasing
internal disorder, ever-growing unhappiness,
marked as with successive mile stones the
progress of < Democratic administration.
That even lower depths of uncertainty, want
and loss were not reached we attribute to the
fact that its President was better than his
party in all respects but one. The Democratic
party was imbued with the most vicious rad
icalisms. Grover Cleveland, with all his
faults, was conservative.
The Republican party won the election in
1890 and commencing with that very hour pros
perity returned. -
HARTFORD, Conn., Sept. 13.â The
Republican State Convention met to
night with United States Senator Or

The indications are that Lieutenant
Governor Henry Roberts will be nomi

first ballot. In second place Rollins S.
Woodruff will be named.
The other places on the ticket prob
ably will go as follows: Secretary of
State, Theodore Bodenwein; Controller,
Azel A. Mitchell, A. J. Mussey or
Charles* Bissell; Treasurer, William E.
Seeley, the present Controller; Con
gressman at Large, George L. Lilly.
The entire fight centers on the head
of the ticket. '
On taking the chair Senator Platt
said: .
The robbery occurred at the end of
a sharp curve, exactly where a similar
holdup was engineered Â£wo years ago
by the Chicago car barn bandits. The
engineer, as the train rounded the
curve, saw a red lantern on the track
and stopped the train. Immediately
the engine, express* car and baggage
car were boarded by the robbers, ap
parently five in number.
A fusillade of shots was fired along
the sides , of the train to prevent in
terference by passengers. The mes
senger of the express car was com
pelled to open . the door and the car
safe was dynamited and the contents
taken, after which the engine crew
was compelled 'to return to the pas
senger coaches. The engine was cut off
and the robbers mounted it, ran it west
through Letts and to within two miles
of Columbus Junction, where the en
gine was left standing on the track.
The manner in which the robbers
handled the engine, their knowledge of
the fact that Letts' was a closed station
at night and the selection of a point
contiguous to .Columbus Junction to
abandon the engine convince the offi
cers that the robbers, or some of them,
are experienced railroad men.
Two packs of bloodhounds are work
ing upon supposed trails of the rob
bers. The one near Columbus Junction
struck a trail three hours after It was
made . by the robbers.' A message re
ceived from the posse states that the
hounds are following the trail and
going in the direction of the Delta,
upon the Mississippi, where : the rcoun
try is overgrown with stunted timber.
DES MOINES, Iowa, Sept. 13.âEx
press officials say that the five bandits
who perpetrated a successful holdup of
the passenger train on the Rock Island
near Letts shortly after midnight this
morning secured no money, though the
safe was blown open and the contents
taken. They aver that the safe con
tained merchandise of some value,
company papers in transit, etc., but
no money.
Three special trains on which were
posses of railroad arid express company
employes and a number of officers were
rushed to the scene of the robbery im
mediately upon the receipt of the news,
going from Muscatine, West Liberty
and Davenport. Horses were procured
in the. country surrounding Columbus
Junction and in that town, near which
point the robbers left the railroad.
Mounted men with bloodhounds are
scouring the country in every direction,
while all trains that pass through Co
lumbus Junction or nearby points are
being carefully 'inspected by officers to
ascertain if the bandits are undertak
ing to escape in this way. The en
gineer and fireman of the train fur
nished pretty accurate descriptions of
the three men.

BELLINGHAM. Wash., Sept. 13. â
The three v bandits who Saturday
night held ud the Canadian Pacific
train are believed to be still within
the boundaries of Whatcom County,
but they have completely dropped
from sight, and not the slightest ad
ditional clew has. been obtained â¢*â¢ by
the posses. Interest is stimulated by
the offer of $5000 reward by the Ca
nadian -Pacific Railway and the Do
minion Express Company, in addition
to 5500 that the Canadian Govern
ment offers for each man captured.
In the woods about where the ban
dits are supposed to be hiding there
are many cabins left by deserted log
ging camps, in one of which they are
believed to be concealing themselves'
by day while they forage at night.
The theory is gaining ground that
the gang. has separated and the indi
vidual members are endeavoring to
make their way out of the country,
each with his share of the $7200 in
gold dust and money obtained from
the express car.

is in need of repairs and coal, Russia
will expect the United States to ignore
the reported Japanese. dem'and that she
be forced to leave within 24 hours and
to permit the necessary repairs to be
made and also to allow the Lena Â¦ to
take on board sufficient coal to enable
her to reach the nearest Russian home
port. It" is not believed, however, that
Russia would object to the stipulation
that if the Lena is, allowed to coal she
shall undertake not to interfere : with
neutral commerce^pending her arrival
at: a home port, ""j '" '
. In official quarters there are two ver
sions of the Lena's mission. According
to the one which is most generally ac
cepted the Lena was sent out to stop
contraband of war bound for Japan,
possibly as In the case of the Russian
volunteer fleet steamships St. Peters
burg and Smolensk, under the direct
orders of Grand Duke Al exan d er Mik
hailovich,. head of the department of
mercantile marine and brother-in-law
of Emperor Nicholas, and was driven
by stress of weather, exhaustion of her
coal supply or fear of returning, to
Vladivostok . after the defeat of the
Vladivostok squadron by the Japanese
squadron, commanded by Vice-Admiral
Kamimura, to seek shelter at San
Francisco. Â¦ . .
The other version of the Lena's mis
sion is that she is to, examine into the
possibilities of the Cape Horn route
for the Baltic squadron.
One feature of the San Francisco dis
patches that has greatly pleased Rus
sians is that reporting .the colloquy be
tween Collector of the Port Stratton
and the Japanese Consul General, who,
when he demanded that he should be
given charge' of the Lena case, was
bluntly told, in effect, by the American
official to "mind his own business."
Newspapers point to this Incident as
Illustrating the growing insolence of
Japan since she has won temporary
success in the war, and the policy that
Japan has been pursuing in Chinese
ports while the powers looked . calmly
on. They liken the case of the Lena to
that of the Ryeshltelnl, which, after. It
had disarmed at Chefu, was attacked,'
seized and towed out of the harbor? by
Japanese warships and is now in the
Japanese naval service.
"It is to be hoped," says the Noyoe
Vremya, "that the action of the federal
official . at . San Francisco will not- be
disavowed at Washington, as was that
of the American admiral at Shanghai.
But the Ryeshltelni incident is not like
ly, to be repeated in an American har
bor.'.'

DISPOSITION OF THE LENA'S CREW
This rule Is enforced to anticipate
any possibility of the engineer or con
ductor forgetting their orders. In the
event of which the fireman and brake
man are in duty bound to remind
them of the fact- Apparently the
fireman and brakeman were neglect
ful in this duty Monday and allowed
Engineer Isoard to send his train into
a. collision. Engineer Boyd and the
fireman of the second engine have
also been adjudged guilty of negiect,
for they received the same orders as
If-oard, notwithstanding the latter
guided the train on its run.
A number of the passengers who
were on the wrecked section of the
?restbour.d train arrived h-j.-j yester
day r**ernoon. and included a party
cf Rock Island excursionists and sev
eral of those who were slightly in
jured in the smashup. In discussing
the accident 3'esterday Manager Ag
ler of the Southern Pacific Bald that
the train crew upon whom had been
affixed the blame for the collision is
doomed to dismissal, but he added
that the case of Engineer Isoard, who
Is in the railroad hospital, will not be
p.cted on until he has recovered suf
ficiently to move about.
The officials of the company are
preparing to thoroughly investigate
the collision. The frank admission
made by Engineer Isoard, however,
hardly necessitates/ further inquiry
into the matter, for he takes the
blame on his own shoulders. It is a
rule^ of the company that on receipt
of train orders an engineer must Im
mediately read the same to his fire
man, and the conductor to his head
brakeman.

Russian War Office Disposes of a
Batch of False Reports.
ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 13.â The
War Office to-day authorized the press
to deny the report circulated by the
Morning Post of London to the effect
that 3000 men of Lieutenant General
Zassulitch's corps have been captured;
to deny the report from the same
source that Zassulitch had been
wounded, and also to deny the state
ment from Tokio that dumdum bul
lets were used by the Russians at Liao
yang.
The general staff denies that Gen
eral Llnevitch has marched into
Northeastern Korea from Vladivostok
and cut General Kuroki's communica
tions with Fengwangcheng, as re
ported in a dispatch from Tientsin to
the London Daily Mail.
The report published in Paris to-day
that Rear Admiral Prince Ouktomsky
had been tried by court-martial, sen

Arthur after the sortie of the Rus-
DENIAL OF WAR FAKES.
With the knowledge of this situation
at the front it is not to be wondered at
that the Russian pres3 Is outspoken In
its demand that Kuropatkin be given a
free hand hereafter, nor is It remark
able that the rumor should be afloat
periodically that the blundering Alexieff
had eent his resignation to the Em
peror.
Now General. Kuropatkin is Just
where he expected to be in September
when he left St. Petersburg to take
command. Through the interference of
Alexieff he has lost thousands of men,
many guns and quantities oC supplies.
Moreover, the morale of his men has
been affected by successive reverses.
But the Russian general will retreat no
farther If his own belief in- the succes3
of his plan of campaign prove to have
been correct. It is expected that at Tie
Pass the Japanese will receive their
final check, and the reinforcements that
are now crossing Siberia will enable
him to take the offensive, either in a
winter campaign, if the "Japanese so
elect, or next spring, when Russia will
have more than a half-million men at
the front.
In the meantime should Port Arthur
fall that disaster, too, could be at
tributed to the interference of Alexieff.
Kuropatkin had planned to give Port
Arthur an enormous garrison and sup
plies sufficient to withstand a year's
siege, expecting to effect the relief, of
the garrison no sooner than late this
autumn or early next spring. Alexieff,
stubbornly confident that one Russian
could easily defeat ten Japanese, or
dered that Kuropatkin send to the Yalu
the men that he had intended for Port
Arthur. After repulsing the Japanese,
said Alexieff, there would be plenty of
time to look after Port Arthur.
The programme of the Russian com
mander-ln-chief was upset as soon as
he reached the front. Viceroy Alexieff
believed that the Japanese, advance
should be met at the Yalu River. De
spite Kuropatkin's protest he was com
pelled to attempt with 35,000 men to
stem the brown legions advancing
through Korea and thereafter fight
battle after battle while falling back
toward the position where he had plan
ned to make his first stand early in
September. Alexleff's policy was popu
lar with the Czar and with the Russian
populace, for the Viceroy told his Em
peror that the Russians would defeat
the islanders, though outnumbered four
to one, and advance to the early relief
of Port Arthur, which stronghold had
been placed in its critical position
through his blundering.
. The Russian heart is: set. upon the
rescue of the brave garrison that for
months has held the "Gibraltar of the
East" against the Japanese besiegers.
It was in the hope of effecting this res
cue that Stakelberg was sent on his
disastrous attempt to pierce the Japa
nese lines and fight "his way to Port
Arthur, and it is the belief here that
the Czar himself ordered that a decisive
stand be made at Liaoyang in the hope
that at last his commender in chief
had been sufficiently reinforced to de
feat the combined Japanese armies and
advance to the relief of Stoessel.
ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 13.â "One
more . 'defeat' and retirement for thÂ»
Russian forces in Manchuria and then
the tide will have turned," said a high
oi ial of the War Department to-day.
"llie 'defeat' will come at Mukden and
the first decisive Russian victory of the
war will occur at Tie Pass, providing
the Japanese continue their advance
beyond Mukden."
The gloom that succeeded the reverse
at Liaoyang has been followed by a
buoyancy that indicates cheering news
from the commander-in-chief. By the
expected defeat at Mukden the official
probably meant that General Kuropat
kin would leave sufficient force there
to check for a time the Japanese ad
vance and when the attack is pressed
too strongly to fall back to the main
army at Tie Pass. The force that will
defend Mukden will consist of 50,000
men. It is not exftected that the Jap
anese will attack the' city within three
weeks, as that period will be necessary
to enable them to replenish their sup
plies of ammunition and get their com
missariat Into shape for a' resumption
of the campaign. The bad roads have
of late delayed the advance of trans
port. f
Tie Pass is the strongest point, from
the standpoint of defensive operations,
in all Manchuria. It . was here that
Kuropatkin, even before he left Russia
for the front, planned to make his first
stand against the Japanese armies.
"There will not be a decisive battle
before December," said Kuropatkin in
before September," said Kuropatkin in

According to a statement made by a

LONDON, Sept 14.â The Daily Mail's
correspondent at Chefu reports that
300,000* Chinese coolies are engaged
upon Japanese entrenchments between
Dalny and Port Arthur. .
The Morning Post's correspondent at
Shanghai hears that the calling out of
a portion of the Japanese territorial
army is Imminent.
From Tokio th^ correspondent of the
Standard . telegraphs that the Chinese
Government is becoming uneasy over
the fate, of Manchuria. An uncon

Wu. Ting Fane, the Chinese assistant
Foreign Minister, will leave Peking
shortly on a special mission to Europe
and America on the Manchurian ques
tion. .
Bennett Burleigh. cabling from Tien
tsin to the Daily Telegraph, still in
sists that the Japanese casualties in
the battle of Liaoyang were nearer 30,
000 than 17,000. Burleigh declares there
is no evidence that the Russians used
dumdum bullets. Burleigh's dispatch
says:
"The ' Japanese, who are bad horse
masters, have many thousands of ani
mals foundered, terribly galled and
sored. Reinforcements both of men
and horses, however, are being has
tened northward. The Mikado's troops
hold secretly but strongly all the dis
tricts to the north along the Llao
River up to Singmintin. I believe the
Chunchuses are organizing for some
important operations north of Mukden.
"Oyama was overheard to say at
Liaoyang that, stuborn as Kuropatkin
is, he must now^be in a desperate con
dition and aware that his game will
not do. Whatever corps Russia may
mobolize, Japan can duplicate them
with better troops put into the field
more quickly.".

A part of the center division of

to the south of Heiyingtai, and facing
a bend in the Taitse River. Upon ap
proaching the Russian trenches they
encountered an unexpected defense.
The Russians had_strung along the
ground i heavy wires, Â¦ highly charged
with electricity, and as the Japanese
soldiers ran against the wires in the
darkness they received severe shocks.
In addition .to this, the Russian troops
defending the trenches threw hand
grenades, or shells, among the storm
ers. The effect was terrifying and
many of the Japanese were wounded.
The attempt to seize this hill, which
was an important vantage ground to
either army, was not successful.
One Japanese battalion which fought
its way into the trenches exhausted
its ammunition. It attempted to cut
its way out with the bayonet, but it
was almost exterminated. On Septem
ber. 3 the Russians withdrew and the
Japanese occupied these positions in
the evening without opposition.
SAN FRANCISCO UNIONS
ADVISED BY FEDERATION
NEW YORK, Sept. 13.â Seven persons
in one family were burned to death and
six others were injured seriously in thÂ«
fire which partially destroyed a tene
ment building at 63-70 First street early
to-day. More than twenty families
were asleep in the building.
It was shortly after 2 o'clock when
the alarm was given. Within the few
moments that had elapsed the flames
gained great headway and the neigh
borhood was in a panic. Women and
children were dropped from the win
dows of the lower floors, and dozens of
grown persons were fighting in thÂ«
hallwas's to reach the open air.
A policeman clambered to the roof of
an adjoining building, and clinging to
the cornice reached down to the win
dows of thÂ« fifth floor and raised seven
children, who were handed 6ut by their
parents.
Another officer, winding a coat about
his head, entered the building from be
low and rolled down the stairs the body
of a half-suffocated man. Three times
the officer came back carrying two per
sons in his arms. Then he fell ex
hausted.
One fireman, although badly burned,
took seven persons from a single win
dow on the fourth floor.
When the work of rescue had been
completed and the flames had been
brought under control the firemen hur
riedly searched the crowded flats, and
on the fourth floor they found seven
dead. They were: Onda Konovitsch;
Anna Konovitsch, his â¢wife; Kono
vitsch, grown son: Konovitsch. sec
ond son; twin babies of the Konovitsch
family, three months old, and an uni
dentified man. - . - ,
Police Captain McDermott and the
firemen who first reached the burning
building believe the fire was of incen
diary origin. The janitor of the build
ing says that an attempt to set fire to
the tenement^ was made last Thursday
night, .when a burning broom that had
been sprinkled with kerosene was found
in the hallway.

lieves it is entirely probable that the
Chinese Government will formally
propose to undertake to guard and to
administer the territory- actually oc
cupied by the Japanese, adding:
*"To' this Japan doubtless will read
ily acquiesce, as it will relieve Japan
of guarding her lines of communica
tion. In other words, regular Chinese
troops will become, auxiliaries to the
Japanese, and the Japanese array, thus
relieved of the necessity of, protecting
its lines, stores and land transport,
will set free all the strength of the
Japanese forces to operate against
Russia. China thus would become ac
tually the ally, of Japan. If the re
ports are confirmed not only Russia,
but other powers, must intervene to
show China what the limits of 'neu

On September 6 some Russian scouts

into some wires hung with bells, which
the Japanese had strung up in order to
sound an alarm. When the bells began

CHEFU. Sept. 13.â Port Arthur's
semi-official journal, the Novi Krai, of
date September 8 announces thai Gen
eral Stoessel, commander of the fort

gratulation from General Kuropatkin.
Early on the morning of September 8 a
thanksgiving service was held in the
barracks of the Tenth Regiment on ac
count of the Czar having issued the
order that each month spent by the
troops In Port Arthur should count as
a year's service.
Operations are at present confined on
both sides to reconnoissances. All along
the line there are occasional encounters

AMMUNITION AT PORT ARTHUR IS ALMOST EXHAUSTED AND GARRISON MUST YIELD
ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 13. â The whole secret of the paralysis that, has apparently stricken the
opposing forces between Ycntal ami Mukden >lies simply in the .fact that rain makes action quite impossi
ble. The roads arc morasses ami the. retreat of the Russian troons is being made at snail's pace. The Jap
anese, who started in pursuit, gave up the task as totally impossible.
Meanwhile interest here is once more turning from the north to the south." Port Arthur again
monopolizes anxious attention. It ! is fully believed ; that a crisis Is imminent there, owing to the approach
ing failure of the ammunition supply. The smokeless powder has ''.entirely given out.
.1 am told that Japanese engineers arc changing the gauge of the railway as fast as it is captured,
but in such a way as to prevent the 'Russians using it later on. One rail-is left, while 'the other .is so
modified that it will bear the lighter type of narrow gauge Japanese, rolling stock, but be useless for the
heavier Russian locomotives and cars. <
The hostile attitude of the Chinese troops Is looked upon as a highly serious feature of the situation.

CUE t UUC* tu Sanscnw Â«C. S. V.CITIZEN OF GOLDEN GATE AND HIS DIVORCED WIFE WHOM HE ACCUSES
OF HAVING SET FIRE TO HIS HOME AND THE COTTAGE THAT WAS
SAVED FROM DESTRUCTION BY FIREMEN.
The woman then started to run
toward Lorin. That was the last seen
of her.
Three fires had been started in dif
ferent places in the dwelling. In the
basement a pile of inflammable rub
bish had been saturated with oil. jg It
was burning briskly when the firemen
broke into the house. In the dining
room half a dozen chairs, a table and
some smaller pieces of furniture, heap
ed in the center of the apartment.
OAKLAND, Sept 13.â In an evident
ly insane attempt to. wreak vengeance
upon .Eric -Thompson, her divorced
husband, Mrs. Christina . Thompson
broke Into the little cottage at 1213
Haspell street, Golden Gate, at 10
o'clock this morning and set fire to the
house in three places. The residence
until her separation from her huband.
two and a half years ago, had been her
home.
* Thompson, a carpenter, was away
at work in Berkeley. The only child,
Kmil, aged 10 years, was at school.
Mrs. Thompson had full swing in her
apparently crazy attempt at incen
diarism. Had it not been for the dis
covery of the fires by neighbors the
home would have been destroyed.
Mrs. E. Stone, who resides next door,
saw smoke pouring from the cottage.
She ran to George Blomberg's grocery
at 3012 San Pablo avenue, a block dis
tant.' and gave the alarm.
Blomberg rushed to the dwelling and
was astounded" to see Mrs. Thompson
standing -in the dining-room near a
pile of blazing furniture, holding in
one hand a bottle of kerosene oil and
in the other what Blomberg thought
was a pistol.
An engine drove by the house to a
fire hydrant a hundred feet distant.
Mrs. Thompson ran out of the house
screaming in a maniacal , way: "Don't
put out the fire. Let it burn!"
Satisfied. that the woman is dement
ed, Thompson lias decided to Institute
a search for her, fearing that she
might attempt to harm him or the boy
who has lived with him since his sep
aration from his wife.
j Mrs. Thompson had a key to one of
the doors. There was no force used in
entering the dwelling except by the
firemen.
had been, sprinkled with kerosene and
set afire.., The third fire was found, in
a back bedroom. under a sofa;
If was the work' of a. few minutes to~
pitch the burning furniture into the
street and to check the spread of the
fire.- Afterward Fire Warden George
McDonald took charge of the premises
and reported the case to the Berkeley
police, the house being just within the
college town limits.* McDonald made
an" investigation-and procured state
ments from Blomberg and a numb.er
of the Thompson neighbors who had 1
seen the woman at the house. Blom
berg told the authorities that he had
no doubt Mrs. Thompson was insane.
She acted like a maniac.
Thompson and his son have been in
dread of the woman for a long time.
Two of her children died three years
ago. It was said they had been pois
oned by eating canned fruit that had
spoiled. Because, of her actions
Thompson procured. a divorce from his
wife shortly afterward. Mrs. Thomp
son went to San Francisco and had
been living . on Bernal Heights. The
husband believes that she 1 was respon
sible for. an attempt that was made to
burn the house about a year ago.
Shortly before this morning's fire
Mrs. Thompson tried to buy coal oil at
D. K. Truelson's grocery at Golden
Gate, but she was not successful, as
her queer actions aroused suspicion.
The authorities have not learned
where the bottle of kerosene was pro
cured. Â¦

OAKLAND, Sept. 13. â Surveyor's
dukes driven across a portion of the
northeast corner of Lake Merritt on
land that has been uncovered bv re
ceding of the lake waters have been
discovered by City Engineer F. C.
Turner. That official sees possibili
ties of an attempt to "jump" six or
seven acres of the lake. Investigation
has been commenced to learn by
whom and for what purpose the
stakes have been set. There is a con
troversy between the city and prop
erty owners abutting on the northeast
arm cf the lake as to the correct
boundary lines. City Engineer Tur
ner suspects that the stakes repre
sent a move to claim some of the
lands that have been in dispute. Some
of this new land was submerged until
the dredging debris working back
from the lake waters filled above the
eurface of the lake waters.

SURVEYOR'S STAKES *
AROUSE SUSPICION
"I yield to no one in my loyalty to
our public schools, but I believe that
economy can be practiced In the School
Departmenet as well as in any other
municipal department. It is easy to
contract an indebtedness and leave ft
to posterity to pay, but it is frequently
that the debts fall due before posterity
has an opportunity."
ALAMEDA. Sept. 18.â Under the dl
tection of the Board of Education a
campaign is being waged to induce the
City Trustees to allow the public
schools the apportionment asked for
out of the coxninsr tax levy, $43,000,
while the employes of the police, fire,
Btreet and electrio light departments
of the municipality are bringing every
influence to bear to persuade the City
Trustees to increase their salaries. The
tax rate is to be fixed on the first Mon
day of October.
Considerable opposition has devel
oped against raising the pay of mu
nicipal employes and there are also
many property owners who believe that
the Board of Education is asking for
an exorbitant apportionment out of the
funds to be raised by taxation. The
persons who believe that the School
Department can be conducted more
economically are City Trustees Dr.
Henry M. Pond and Â¦William M. Bowers
and they have not hesitated in putting
themselves on record. Dr. Pond re
cently stated that he believed that
more teachers were employed than
were required and that the classes were
too small. He also expressed himself
as being opposed to the teaching of
manual training and cooking in the
public schools.
In explaining his position City Trus
tee Bowers said to-night:

since her re-election and In her greeting to
the club paid a pretty tribute to Mrs. C. W.
Kinsey, who aa vice president supervised club
affairs during the unsettled period between
Mrs Hume's resignation and re-election. She
said' that Mrs. Kinsey had taken up the reins
of government at a crucial moment and too
much could not be said in praise of the splen
did manner . In which she had performed the
duties of an office that she. had been so sud
denly called upon to fill. Mrs. Kinsey*s gra

Greek department are becoming: more and
more ' interested In the presentation of the
"Ajax" of Sophocles as the time approaches
for its final staging. Assignments of the
speaking parts have already been made .and
the lines are being rehearsed daily under the
direction of Miss Mabel Barrows of New York.
While the burden of committing the lines
resis with the nine principals the most char
acteristic feature of a Greek tragedy Is the
chorus. In the "AJaJc" the chorus is made up
of fifteen sailors and warriors, companions of
Ajax, who had followed him from Troy to
Salamls. They are intimately concerned with
the action of the play and reflect the emotion
of the actor. Without a well trained and
sympathetic chorus a Greek tragedy is im
possible, however good the other characters
may be. It is for this reason that Miss Bar
rows has been cautious in her selection of the
people to take these singing parts.

The case of Dr. Benjamin F. Stoll,
charged with murder, was on the cal
endar of Judge 'Cook's court yester
day to be reset for trial. Attorney
Kosmer objected to the proceedings on
the ground of "once in jeopardy," and
a continuance was granted till Monday,
when the point wM be -argued. .
;: It was the intention of Judge Cook
to retry the case with the same, jury,
but one of the jurors cannot be found.
He is August "Wamecke, who at the
previous trial in December, 1902, gave
his address as 150 Front street. The
clerk of the court has been unable to
find any trace of him.
If the point raised by Attorney Hos
mer is sustained there will be no ne
ct'ssity of retrying the case, but if not
the absence of Juror Wamecke will
complicate matters.
Dr. Stoll shot and killed Dr. Robert
J. Blake in the Phelan building on Os
tober 16, 1902, and a plea of self-de
fense was upheld by Judge Cook at
the trial. The Judge Instructed the
jury to acquit. The , District Attorney
appealed to. the Supreme Court and a
new trial was granted on the ground
that the Judge erred in his instruction
to acquit

This caused an observing citizen to re
mark: "Do you think I want to vote
with one of you fellows Inside keeping

"This thing is not opened on election

how to care for the Indigent sick of

reached a score and Deputy Health

years ago. He admitted that he had
come to this country at the invitation
of his uncle, who had promised him
employment at his calling at wages
of $100 per month. A special board
of inquiry will try the case and young

Two Japanese women who arrived
on the Korea were stopped by Im
migrant Inspector Persch. They said
they had been married in Japan "by
photograph" to two Japanese resid
ing in Fresno. The long distance hus
bands were at the dock to greet the
brides that they had never seen ex
cept by photo. They were informed
that they would be required to pro
cure licenses and marry the women
according to the laws of California
before they -would be allowed "to cut
up any honeymoon monkeyEhines" on
American soil. At latest reports the
brown men from Fresno were char

United States Immigrant Inspector
D. J. Griffiths prevented the landing
from the Korea yesterday of Gustave
Hermann Liss, a stationary engineer.
The resolution was supported enthu
siastically, and its adoption was unani
mously voted. By this resolution Pres
ident Roosevelt is asked to call a sec
ond session of The "Hague conference.
The resolution reads as follows:
Whereas, Enlightened public opinion and the
spirit of modern civilization alike demand
that differences between* nations should be ad
judicated and settled In the same manner as
disputes between individuals are adjudicated,
namely, by the arbitration of courts In ac
cordance with recognized principles of law,
the conference requests the several govern
ments of the world to send representatives
to an International conference to be held at
a time and place to be agreed upon by them
for the purpose of considering: â¢
First â The questions for the consideration
of which the conference at The Hague ex
pressed a wish that a future conference be
called.
Second â The negotiation of arbitration
treaties between the nations represented at the
conference to be convened. Â»
Third â The advisability of establishing an
International congress to convene for the dis
cussion of International , questions periodically.
And thio conference respectfully and cor
dially requests the President of the United
States to Invite all the nations to send repre
sentatives to such a conference.
The Hungarian group sponsored a
movement intended to forbid the use
of floating submarine mines, but op
position developed on the ground that
this matter might well be left for the
hoped-for Hague conference and Count
Apponyl withdrew the Hungarian reso
lution.
The conference will adjourn to-mor
row.
WANT SECOND SESSION.
SHOCKED BY THE WAR.
Following is the resolution:
The Inter-Parliamentary Conference, shocked
by the horrors of the. war that Is being waged
In the Far East, between two civilized states,
and deploiing that the powers signatory of
the. convention of The I Hague have been un
able to hava recourse to the clauses thereof,
which direct them to tender their mediation
Immediately uoon the outbreak of hostilities,
asks the powers signatory of the convention
of The Hague to Intervene either jointly or
separately with the belligerents in order to
facilitate the restoration of peace and In
structs the Inter- Parliamentary Bureau to
bring the present resolution to the knowledge
of said powers.
Le Comte d'Alviella In presenting the
resolution used these words:
I trust we shall render Russia a great favor
in helping i ber out of her difficulties. As to
Japan, I am one of those who have thought
from the outset that the existence of a strong
Japanese empire in the Far East may become
a factor in the equilibrium of the world, pro
vided this empire stands not as a new factor
of war, but as an element of peace and civil
ization. *
In closing he urged that the Presi
dent of the United States was quite the
proper person to tender mediation.
The new. Hague conference proposi
tion was next taken up. Congressman
Burton of Cleveland presented the reso
lution and urged its adoption.
ST. LOUIS, .Sept. 13;â The important
business for which the Inter-Parlia
meritary Union assembled was trans
acted at the second session, which was
held to-day. With \ great unanimity
these representatives of fifteen â¢ differ
ent national, parliaments adopted two
resolutions of far-reaching importance.
In one the powers of the world are
asked ta intervene now in the Russo-
Japanese war. In another the nations
of the world are invited to participate
in a second session of the Hague con
ference and President, Roosevelt is re
quested to issue the call. .
The /measure looking toward inter
vention in the Far East was adroitly
amended. Originally the resolution pro
vided for intervention "at' the proper
time." The last four words, however,
were stricken out on the ground that
immediate intervention Is necessary.
Count Goblet d'Alviella of Belgium was
responsible for this amendment. It was
also the Belgian Senator who brought
about the insertion of a phrase calling
for intervention of the powers "Jointly
and separately," and the hint was
delicately but informally. ., thrown out
in this connection^that" the President of
the United States could most properly
tender mediation.

Â¦ The president *f the university wishes to
report to the Regents the following reorganiza
tion of the faculty of the dental department
and to ask confirmation thereof:
Professor John Marshall Williamson has re
signed the professorship of anatomy and his
resignation has been accepted by the Regents.
For the present the chair will remain vacant,
the work Delng done by two instructors.
Dr. Maurice James Sullivan has resigned the
professorship of pathology, therapeutics and
materia medtca. He will continue his work
as chief demonstrator In the infirmary and
rive double time theretoâ a great advantage,
it is believed, in the concentration of Dr. Sulli
van's energies upon this work In the Infirmary.
The work in pathology, therapeutics and ma
teria medlca Is to be divided between two men
â Dr. Charles A. Litton, with the title of act
ing professor of bacteriology .and pathology,
and Dr. Alfred Schneider, acting professor of
therapeutics and materia medica.
The following recommendations were
adopted:
FACULTY REORGANIZED.
Mrs. Eugenia ScheDck has presented to the
university the library of her late husband,
who was a civil and mining engineer. The
collection consists of about two hundred vol
umes in civil, mining and mechanical engineer
ing, and in chemistry, physics, botany, zoology,
geology, mineralogy and astronomy.
The Bulgarian Government, through the very
kind Intercession of M. BakhmeteflV Russian
Minister at Sofia, and of Jerome B. Landfield
of the department of history, has presented to
the university a -set of valuable : philological
and folk-lore publications of the Ministry of
Public Instruction, entitled. "Sbornlk za No
rodn! Umotvortnla. Nauka 1 Knlzchnlaa."
A friend of the university, who requests
that his name be not made known, has de
frayed the cost â $97 Â«) â of the colored plates
for the last publication In the university series
in zoology, "The Structure and Regeneration
of the Poison Glands of Blethodon," by Calvin
Esterly.
The San Joso High Ecbool has presented to
the university ? 123 to be applied to the support
of the San Jose High School scholarship for
the current university year. The holder U
Giffcrd B. West.
The Girls' Scholarship Association of the Los
Angeles Hisrh School has presented to the uni
versity $510 to be applied to the support of
three scholarships for the current university
year. The holders of these scholarships are:
Miss Grace Tower, Miss Edith Walters and
Miss Lillian Head.
Regent Foster of the finance commit
tee backed up Britton. "If any of Mr.
Budd's friends have been Injured," he
said, "I am prepared to vote at this
moment. Personally, though, I agree
with Mr. Britton that the right man
has not shown up yet."
Budd was determined, however, and
arising excitedly exclaimed: "I'll force
an election in November or I'll quit.
That's all there is to it." -
President Wheeler reported as fol
lows:
"Well," retorted Budd. "If the finance
committee don't recommend a man I
wilL"
Reinstein in reply said that he did
not approve of Budd's motion, but had
seconded it to bring out an expression
of opinion.
Britton of the finance committee said
that so far as the committee was con
cerned It had failed to make a recom
mendation simply because the proper
man had not yet shown up.
President Wheeler presented a num
ber of recommendations, the most im
portant cf which were that there be a
reorganization of the staff in the col
lege of dentistry and the authorization
of the erection of a temporary addition
to the college of agriculture, at a cost
not to exceed $5000.
Under the head of new business Re
gent Budd made his motion to have the
election of a secretary made a special
order. To bring the jnatter before the
body Regent Reinstein seconded it.
Budd took the floor and In support of
his motion said: "The finance commit
tee is authorized to recommend a man
for this position, and although we have
been waiting almost a year no report
has been received from it. The present
manner of acting is not fair to the act
ing secretary, the applicants or any
one else."
LOOKING FOR A MAN.
In the absence of Governor Pardee,
Regent Earl presided. Those present
v.-ere President Wheeler and Regents
Taussig, Rowel!. Reinstein. Budd, Fos
ter, Ellinwood. Earl, Yorke, Britton
and Dohrmann.
The Board of Regents of the Univer
sity of California at its meeting yester
day afternoon again failed to select a
secretary to fill the place of the de
faulter, McKowen. A resolution intro
duced by Regent Budd making the se
lection of a secretary a special order of
business for the November meeting was
voted dov.n, Budd and Yorke alone
supporting it.
Of the 6C8 new regular students S4ft are
men and 2C2 women, as compared with 323
men and 214 women In 1903. . The percentage
of men among this year's new regular stu
dents Is 67.4. as compared with 60.3 last year,
and 60.2 In 1002.
This Is exclusive of the wmmer session,
which for the, current year registered 913 stu
dents, as compared with 86S, 830, 799 and 433
for the four preceding years.
Of the 846 students admitted this year 608
have been admitted as regular student*. 43
as limited, 100 as special students and 95 as
graduated students.
The students of the professional schools will
be in addition to the total here given of 2755.
The figures are not yet available for this year,
but last year the total enrollment In the
schools of law, medicine, dentistry, pharmacy,
and art, was 59". as compared with 606 in
1902-03 677 in 1901-02. and 797 in 1900-01.
Making a conservative estimate of 600 for the
current year the total enrollment In all de
partments of the university for the year would
amount to 33.">5.
By September 9 the enrollment for the col
leges at Berkeley had reached a total of 2455
as compared with 2.15)2 on the corresponding
date last year, and 2434 by September 9, 1902.
On September 20, 1901, the total enrollment
was 2229, and on September 20. 1900, 2002 â
that Is to say. In five years the number of
students has increased by nearly one-fourth.
Of the 2455 student* now enrolled 846 are this
year newcomers. Â»
Judging by previous years the further regis
trations between now and the end of the year
will be not less than 300. which makes a to
tal for the year of 2755. as compared with
268S last year; 2669 In 1902-03; 2470 In 1901
02. and 2229 In 1900-01.
STATISTICS OP EXROMiMENT.
The University of California, will be rep
resented at the International Congress of Arts
and Sciences at St. IxjuIs by fifteen members
of its faculty. Professor Jacques Loeb, Pro
fessor Adoiph C. Miller and the president of
the university will deliver departmental ad
dresses: Director W. W. Campbell, Professor
Elmer E. Brown, Professor Carl C. Plehn,
Professor Samuel B. Christy. Professor Ber
nard Moses and Professor. William E. Rltter
will deliver sectional addresses: Professor Fred
eric W. Putnam and Professor Charles Mills
Gayley are to preside at departmental and sec
tional meetings, and Astronomer C. D. Per
rine. Astronomer Robert G. Altken. Profes
sor A. O. Leuschner and Professor M. W.
Haskell will speak at sectional meetings. Pro
fessor George Davidson, Professor George H.
Howison and Professor H. Morse ' Stephens
were also invited to deliver sectional addresses
or to preside at meetings, but declined. Of
American universities only Harvard. Columbia
and Chicaeo will be more numerously repre
sented on the programme of the congress. I
recommend that leave of absence of two
weeks be granted Â«?ach of these members of
the faculty. (Granted.)
Industry. Most of the treat asparagus field*
<Â« the Sacramento River delta have been kept
entirely tree from rust this season by methods
recommended by the' university, at practically
no extra expense to the growers, .while in
fields not similarly treated the rust is pres
ent and abundant. At Sacramento a most
complete demonstration has been made in the
way of funticidal treatment for badly infest
ed localities, treated and untreated Qefda
standing side by side, under natural condi
tions In every way Identical, the one per
fectly green and healthy, the other black and
dead. The asparagus industry in California
represents a value of at least $2,500,000 in the
fields nlone, together with numerous valuable
canning plants situated bo as to be useless
for any, other purpose. The annual output
amounts to perhaps $1,500,000 in canned and
fresh asparccus.
Professor Smith came to thÂ» university a
year ago to undertake this work, which
had been provided for by contributions of
the asparagus growers of California. I have
now authorized him to â¢ go East from Sep
tember 1 to C^tober . 1 in order that he may
complete his Etudy of the asparagus rust by
cemparinsr the methods which he has developed
here with the latest results achieved at other
agricultural experiment stations.
I present herewith resolutions passed by the
Farmers' Institute, held at Capitola on August
80 and 31, thanking the university and ex
pressing high appreciation of the efforts of
the University of California in disseminating
useful knowledge amongst the farming com
munities of this State by means of Farmers'
Institutes and other means.

ceipts now exceed the expenditures at
the treasury. The change came last
Saturday, when thfe. receipts exceeded
expenditures of $157,000. The treas
ury is ahead $400,000 for the first
twelve days of this -month and the
indications are that the month of Sep

over the expenditures.
The deficit for the fiscal year Is al
ready $23,375,000. and while the op
erations of September cannot be ex
pected to cut that down ' materially,
the change is for the better and by the
1st of November the deficit should be
greatly reduced. This is in accord

while . the expenditure/*, immediately

The testimony for the prosecution
at the trial of Frederick Tobelmann.
charged with the murder of his wife.,
Mae. at 603% Minna street* on April
1, before a jury in Judge Dunne's court
was closed yesterday afternoon. The
defense will proceed this morning and
an effort will be made to prove thac
the defendant was temporarily insane
at the time of the murder.
Eighteen witnesses were examined
yesterday, including two physicians
and six police officers. Their evidence
was the same as given at the pre
liminary examination. The ante
mortem statement made by Mrs. To
belmann to Assistant District Attor
ney Ferrari was introduced. In it
she charged the defendant with shoot
ing at her four times while shs waa'
sitting on the bed in the room, occu
pied by her and her children at hoc
brother-in-law's residence. Tha re*-Â»
son was because she had refused, to
live with him again unless he pxora-.

dren.

"We -believe Count Apponyi to be
a man of liberal views," said Ambrose,
"and we feel convinced that his con
tact with America's institutions will
clearly see the monstrous injustice
with which his Government has been
treating the Slavaks."
ST. LOUIS, SepL 13.â The Slavonic
societies of the United States to-day
presented to Count Apponyi, chairman
of the Hungarian delegation to the
St. Louis interparliamentary peace
congres>, a memorial written in Eng
lish, French and Hungarian, calling
upon him to take note of the liberai
institutions of ' America and allow
their spirit so to imbue him that, re
turning to Hungary, he may act as
the apostle of a new gospel of free
dom for the oppressed Slavaks there.
Anthony-S. Ambrose, president of
the National Slavonic Society of the
United States, one of the signers of
the memorial, says that the sole ob
ject of addressing it to Count Ap
ponyi was in the hope that it might
insure at least Â«Â» modicum of the bet
terment of the condition of their kins
men on the other side.
Ask Hungarian Delegate to Inter

Oakland did its only good work with
the club in thÂ« fourth. Francks led off
with a dinky hit to third, Ganley bunt
ed to Bauin and Buck was neatly dou
bled at first. Then Dunleavy respona
ed with a drive to center and Schlafley
v,itÂ£ there with- a little old Texas
leaguer to right that cave Oakland its
only run.
A lucky stop by Bauzn cut off a cou
ple in the fifth. Deveraux had walked
and Stark fc-ot a scratchy two-bagger
when Tonan wasn't looking. With
two on the bags, Graham took an
awful swing on the ball and it went
right at Baum. The youngster stopped
it in a trice asd caught Devereaux at
the r-aa. Had the ball got away it
v.ouM icurely have gone to the field for
a couple of bases.
IÂ»s Angeles put in the finishing
touches In the seventh when Zagai
lined a double-sacker to center and
Baum sacrificed. Bernard brought the

cuit trot tine summary:
Caspian Takes the First and Fourth
GRANT* CIRCUIT TROTTING.
He has paced more heats in 2:00 and
better than any horse that ever lived.
His last mile was in 2:03%. at Milwau
kee last week. The last half in lUHWi
was accomplished so easily that an
other season of exhibitions around the
2:00 mark was looked forward to, with
a possibility of- his equaling his mark
of 1:55U by the time he reached Mem
phis in October.
Up to the present season he has been
trained and driven by M. E. McHenry
in his exhibitions, but the present sea
son has been in charge of Superin
tendent Hersey of the International
Stock Farm, who has been singularly
successful in bringing the champion
into racing form so soon after his heavy
stud season.
He was sold bv his breeder as a four
year-old to M. E. Sturges of New York,
who in turn sold him in 1302 to W. M.
Savage of Minneapolis, Minn., for JSO,
000, the largest price ever paid for a
pacer.
In the four years he has been on the
turf he never lost a race, and was de
feated in but two heats, which It is
claimed he could have won easily. '*â¢*
TOPEKA, Sez>U 12.â Dan Patch.
1:0614, the champion pac=r of the world,
will be dead by morning. He is dying
in the greatest agony from strangu
lated hernia. The veterinary surgeon
in attendance at the champion's big
stall at the Fair Grounds has received
a telegram from his owner, W. M.
Savage, begging him to keep the horse
alive until he can reach here. He left
Minneapolis this evening. The veter
inary and Superintendent Hershey, who
is in personal charge of the horse, are

BRIGHTON' BEACH, Sept. 13.â "Won
by a fiuke" was the verdict after Afri
cander's number went up as the win
ner of the Brighton Preliminary to-day.
Owing to O'Neill's alertness after Mc-
Chesney had bolted to the outside of
the track on the lower turn Africander,
which had bâ¬en running just behind
McChesney, shot up between that horse
and the rail horse and by the time the
Western idol was once more straight
and in his stride he found Africander in
front cf him and making a bold bid for
the race. On Africander's left was Eu
genia Burch, the pacemaker, while just
behind was The Picket, which had been
bumped by McChesney when the horse
was pulled into the rail, and thereby
lost a lot of ground.
The spectators could not believe it
was Africander which had loomed up
as a possible winner. With Redfern on
McChesney hard at work with his whip
and heels on his right hand side, and
Eugenia Burch in equal stress on his
left hand side and The Picket almost
literally treading on the heels of Afri
cander, the finish for the mile and a
half Brighton Preliminary was spectac
ular to the last degree.
It was not so satisfying to those who
backed M-cChesney. The finish was
three heads â Africander first, McChes-
Dey second, Eugenia Burch third. The
Picket, fourth, was. beaten half a length.
Major Daingerfleld v^.3 last from a bad

heralded as a "good thing" and pound
ed nearly off the boards, being backed
down from 8 to 4 to 1, finished third in
the third race to-day at Hawthorne.
He was then disqualified for fouling
Lida Lieb, a 20 to 1 shot, which was
given third money. Old Ben Chance,
which ha3 been campaigning on the
Western tracks winter and summer for
five years, proved the best after Henry
gave him a perfect ride. When set down
in the stretch Ben Chance wore down
his field and won going away by a good
length.
A sloppy track, disagreeable weather

SCHOONER EMMA CLAUDINA.
. WHICH HAS NOT BEEN HEARD
FROM IN MONTHS.
TO ARRIVE,
Movements of Steamers.
The three-masted schooner T>nmÂ». Claudina,
which left PuÂ£et Sound last May for Baranoff
Island and has not since been heard of. has
been familiar along this coast for more than
twenty years. She is a vessel of 188 tons net
recister and was built in 1SS2 by Matthew
Turner at Benicia. She is owned by the
Cfcarjes Nelson Company of this city. She was
la food condition uhen she left Puget Sound
and in spite of the dangers w^hlch lurk in
Alaskan waters, her owners have confidence in
her safety. Her destination is beyond reach
by telegraph and the mail service from Baran
cfl is larjjely a matter of chance. â¢*-"â¢'-Â¦'Â¦
"Rmmfl Caudlna Well Known.
Among the leading topics to be dis
cussed at the coming session of the con
gress next month are waterways, har
bors, Panama canal, semi-arid regions,
merchant marine, trade with the
Orient, consular service, statehood,
railroad transportation, preservation of
forests, sugar industry, trade with,
Mexico, exports and imports through
the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific
Ocean, encouragement of . home manu
factures, good roads and drainage, the
Lewis and Clarke Exposition, the pro
posed â¢ Federal \ Department of Mines
and Mining, trade with Alaska and
Canada and kindred matters-
Governor Pardee may appoint ten
delegates at large from thla State. The
cities are entitled to one delegate each
and one" delegate for every additional
5000 inhabitants.
Mr. Loveland was. a delegate last
year from California. He then realized
that there was a lack of understanding
amemg the California delegation. Mr.
Loveland has already been appointed
to represent several commercial organi
zations in this city.
The fifteenth session of the Trans-
Mississippi Commercial Congress will
be opened in St. Louis October 25 and
will continue five days. All the Pacific
Coast States will send delegates, also
Alaska, 'Arkansas, Arizona, Colorado,
Iowa, Idaho, Indian Territory, Kansas,
Louisiana, Minnesota, Montana, Mis
souri; Nebraska, Nevada^.New Mexico,
North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon,
South Dakota, Texas, Utah and Wyo
ming. These States and Territories are
represented each by one member in the
executive committee. The United Com
mercial Travelers and the Travelers'
Protective Association also are repre
sented each by one member of the com
mittee. .
H. D. Loveland, vice president for
California of the Trans-Mississippi
Commercial Congress, dias addressed
letters to Governor Pardee and to
Mayor Schmitz requesting them to
make early appointments for delegates
for the State of California and this city
to the congress, to the end that before
the delegates from California start for
St. Louis they may counsel together in
this city and so come to some under
standing, that they may act unitedly
for the good of the State.
There have been fourteen preceding
sessions of the Trans-Mississippi Com
mercial Congress. The first was held in
Galveston, Tex., in 1S90. Last year the
congress met at Seattle. There has
never been a session in this city. Or
dinarily the California delegates have
met^ for the first time after their ap
pointment on the cars as they jour
neyed to the city selected, for the con
gress. Under such circumstances there
has been little opportunity for discus
sion of home interests in advance.

THE NEGRO VOTE.
Senator Clapp of Minnesota is by
reason of his personal appearance fre-
r T"*HE International Peace Congress will hold its thirteenth ses-
I sion in Boston during the first week of October. Thither dele
Â¦**â¢ gates from a majority of the civilized countries of the world are
to betake themselves in unselfish humanitarian devotion to the cause
of the nations' good. Though the unlucky number of their con
vention seems to be signalized by a war the bloodiest of the genera
tion, these devotees to the fostering of universal peace will, by the
very fact of their convocation, give earnest of the growth of better
ideals in the world's councils.
The work of this peace congress and of like "international arbi
tration associations must be one of long and arduous education,
fraught with many rebuffs and great discouragements. Theirs is a
vision which has been before the eyes of idealists through long years
of battling and turmoil and has yet refused to down. In the early
years of the last century the Holy Alliance gave at first high promise
of the fulfillment of the longed-for wish,' but proved to be nothing
but an engine of tyranny under the artful hand of Metterriich. At
the end of the century came the establishment of The Hague tri
bunal, a definite triumph at last for the cause of peace, though one
failing of some of the hoped-for results. This js at least a substantial
mile post in the progress of the campaign of peace.
With the spirit of militarism still strong among the nations and
the prospect of universal peace yet in the far horizon, the inter
national congress may, nevertheless, find work to do in alleviating
the horrors of war. Out of the present Far Eastern conflict there
have arisen questions touching. the inhumanity of some modern en
gines of destruction which will probably find hearing before -The
Hague Court when the noise of conflict has ceased. Strong utter
ances upon these subjects on the part of the International Peace
Congress would surely be given respectful audience there.

Judge E. H. Gary, chairman of the

used to live in (he Illinois town of

"One day. in Wheaton." Judge Gary
said recently, "I took dinner with a

Joe, and Joe was a very bright boy.

course of the dinner. 'I have a ques

" 'All right; I'll answer your ques

attained the rank of major-general and
is an active, member of the German
general staff.
Prince Frederick Leopold of Prussia
goes to worjc at the front very much
against his will, according to the Ber
lin newspapers. He is a leisure-loving,
scion of royalty and had settled down
for a comfortable summer at his mag
nificent country estate at Klein. Glien
icke, near Potsdam. He has the. repu- |
tation of shunning military dutj* as far
as possible, although he comes from
high-class martial stock, hfs father,
the late Prince Frederick Karl, known
during the Franco-German war as the
"Red Prince," ori account of his fero
cious blond beard, having beon one of
the most dashing of leaders on the vic
torious German side. Prince Frederick
Karl is an ardent automobilist and
equestrian and the' palace ; grounds at
Klein Glienicke are fitted up with pri
vate driving paths and, automobile
tracks, where his royal highness
amuses himself in almost hermit-like
style. The Kaiser's summons to pack
mp and hustle to the sun-broiled firing
line in Manchuria came as a complete
surprise and the atmosphere at Klein
Glienicke is said in consequence to have
been surcharged with strong language
when; the Imperial command, which, of
course, brooks no declination, reached
the , premises. That Prince Frederick
Leopold intends to travel and work
with as much luxury as possible, nev
ertheless,: is apparent from the an
nouncement that his ! suite for Man
churia will consist-. of eight/servants
and four specially chosen horses. His
Royal Highness will leave Berlin ; for
Manchuria, via St. Petersburg and the
Trans-Siberian ' railway, soon. At* the
I Russian, capital he will stop .to, pay
the Kaiser's compliments to the Czar.

Prince Karl Anton, /who will keep his
eye -on' Japanese : tactics and strategy,
is every inch a soldier and his appoint
ment for active service as military at
tache in. the Far East is said to be wel
comed by him heartily. He is regarded
as '- one of Germany's - most promising
young 'officers. He is married -to : Prin

known and favorite character In Berlin,

amiability. "He does not y; look like

"A Fool .Woman" is no fool at all, judged by the standard of
sense on this subject as fixed by public opinion. But judged by the
standard of official-indifference to forest preservation, she,is', and so
arc we all, fools and blind. /
Not long ago The Call congratulated the State that the sum
mer had passed in California with no destructive forest fires. Since
then conflagrations have attacked and marred or destroyed some of
the finest forests in the Coast Range, and nearly invaded to obliterate
the State Redwood Park, in the Big Basin. That primitive forest
Â¦was reached by a road that was delightful in every mile. Now that
highway lies blistering through a blackened waste, from which all
beautv has been burned..
Respectfully, A FOOL WOMAN.'.'
We are not able to answer that. Perhaps in the distant future
there may arise an association, fashioned on the present Landmarks
Society, to be called "The Forest Relic and Stump Savers," with the
object of saving the stumps as evidence that we once had forests. If
our correspondent rely on legislation to save the stumps, they will
not be saved. Public opinion, the press, clubs and associations have
dinned for a quarter of Â«t century for legislation to save the forests
from fire without interfering with their commercial use. After being
cut for lumber the forests would renew themselves, if some simple
and inexpensive precautions were taken to keep them from burning.
But all appeals have been met with indifference and the destruction
increases every vear.
THE CALL is in receipt of the following letter from San Jose:
"Editor Call: Now that our forests are about gone, what
are our able legislators going to do about preserving the stumps?

"If you ask, 'Why* do they receive
such small pay?'* the reply is, 'The
employer knows they will get the tips
and counts on it J and again you are
assured that tips are wages and should
not be withheld.
"But a few minutes' consideration
shows that not only are tips not wages,
but they destroy wages. Wages are a
definite sum* 1 agreed upon by employer
and worker. To pay them is an obli
gation, to receive them is a right. : A
tip is a favor, a charity. It can be
given or withheld at will. Its be
stower swears with self -satisfied benev
olence. Its receiver, a true flunky,
graduates his thanks to match the
amount of, the gratuity. A tip is not
wages, for no man has a-t right to ; de
mand it; He can only cringe and kow
tow, in the hope of not missing it.*

any atonement for the manhood sacri
ficed in the getting. The steamer

Britisher only stands out for "tup
pence/. Of course : the tips run _ from
these trifles up, and sometimes high up
âand 'that's the way the money goes.'
"But it was. after , all, the small tips
that shocked^ me: most To 'think that

"I have just returned from a trip
through Europe where I naturally

To take the medicinal properties of

ficial, aspecially as a stimulant, with

and if it is properly made and is taken
with milk it has only the most benefi

It may not be generally known that
people who Imagine they canot drink
tea have been surprised to find that
they can -when they use milk, instead
of drinking it, as is customary in this
country, either without milk or with a
slice of lemon floating in the tea. Tea
is goodafor the throat. It is an antidote
for malaria and is found beneficial in
cases of extreme fatigue. The Egyptian

I overheard the other day one of '
America's pretty girls remark that she
"never drank tea because she thought

bad for the complexion," writes Mrs.
Hart Davis in the Chicago Journal.
Now, this is a great mistake that most
of the American women make. The
best way to show the fallacy is to draw
attention to some of the prettiest and

tea nearly all day long and have the
most peachllke complexions of any

girls drink large quantities of tea every
day.

COPYRIGHT, 1904. BY SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. AND THE NEW YORK EVENING MAIL..
MR. HEARST prints, in his Examiner, an appeM in behalf of the
raisin-growers of California, declaring that failure to market
their crop would "mean distress to many thousands of hard
working people who have made a garden out of a desert and deserve
well of their fellow-citizens." As they have not issued an address to
the American people in behalf of their industry, he announces that
the Hearst papers will do it for them, which they will no doubt duly
appreciate.- He then proceeds to do it, addressing the American peo
ple as follows: V . . i_ t.
"We are a community of good American citizens, who have
built up a great industry intended to supply you with a cheap and
wholesome article of food. A few years ago you had to send to
Europe for the raisins you wanted. To-day they are produced abun
dantly by your fellow-'citizens, who are selling them at much lower
prices than you had to pay to the importers. But for some reason
vou arc not buying them." â¢
Whatever the facts may be about the failure to purchase raisins
and consume them in sufficient quantities, the other statements of the
Hearst appeal are correct. The domestic raisin is as good v as the
imported, or better. Before it was grown here people paid about
three times as much for their raisins, imported from Spain. In order
to give the California raisin a chance, the tariff on the imported
raisin was put at 5 cents a pound. The Wilson tariff of 1894 re
duced it to one and a half cents. The Dingley tariff, denounced in
the present Democratic platform, raised it to two and a half cents.
Under this prices have betn satisfactory until now, from some cause,
there is a failure io take the whole output, with injury to prices.
Raisin-growing has been a tariff bred industry entirely. The
Democratic press in the feast has denounced a tariff on raisihs every
time the subject has been under discussion. The protectionists have
always contended that protection would cheapen -the article. When
the importer had control of our raisin market Mr. Hearst admits that
he charged a higher price than California raisins have sold for at a
profit to their producers. Therefore it is plain that if the market
is again given to the importers and our raisin production ceases,
Americans will soon be paying* a higher price for their raisins.
It is to be regretted that our raisin-growers are not finding a
place for their stock. The cause, .we are persuaded, is temporary.
But if "theirobber tariff" were taken off, the foreign product would
first undersell and destroy the California raisin industry, 'and then
up would go the price again. It was the same with steel rails, tin
and a great variety of American industries, which were germinated
here by protection, with the result of lowering the price to the Amer
ican consumer. It may be that the present raisin tariff is too low,
and we suggest to Mr. Xee'dham, who represents Fresno^in Congress,
that he look into it, and if necessary get the rate doubled.
Mr. Hearst, continuing his appeal, assures the people that raisin
seeds do not cause appendicitis, and says: "Buy California raisins.
They arc better than the foreign, yet in the three years last past
15,266.887 pounds of raisins were brought into this country and sold
to you."
While that is not a very large importation, it offends Mr. Hearst.
But pray how can he stop it without making the "robber tariff" on
raisins higher than it is? Last year we produced 112,000,000 pounds
of raisins. If the home market will not take them all, why not ex
port them to England and sell them so cheaply that the surplus will
be taken there? But to do this with a surplus production is de
nounced by the Democracy, and to Mr. Hearst is indisputable evi
dence that we have a "robber tariff." We can see no remedy except
maintenance of the present robber tariff on raisins, and increasing it,
if need be, to shut out the imports of which Mr. Hearst complains.
The whole tariff issue is illustrated in the raisin question, and Mr.
Hearst's party says it is all "robbery."

Sluff calls for a deck of thirty-six
cards, the- cards from deuce to five

There are .120 points in the game.
Aces count 11, tens 10, kings 4, queens
3 and jacks 2. Y,'i%~
Two, three or four may play, T>ut In
any case only "three full hands are
dealt. The dealer remains out when
four play.
The cards are dealt one at a time
in four hands until after twelve are so
dealt; after to three hands to the end
of the deck. This gives three hands of
It is not possible to lay hands on
a written or printed set of rules of the
game, but half the men in the Terri
tory can tell one how to play. The
rules differ in minor particulars In dif
ferent camps, "but this is the way it is
generally played:
Where the game came from, who in
troduced it and what its antecedents
were no one seemed to remember. For
two years sluff has been growing in
popularity every day, and the man
who cannot play it leads a lonely life.
Sluff is cheaper for the stranger
than poker, for, as a rule, it is not
played for money. Drinks for. the
crowd is the usual penalty for losing a
game, and strangers are supposed to
buy the drinks, in any event. Like all
c*ard games which attain sudden popu
larity, sluff is * easily explained and
quickly learned. In spite of Its sim
plicity great skill can be developed
and Arizona holds crackerjack players.
Ordinarily a game take* about fif
teen minutes. In Pearce, where it is
now the fashion to drink whisky with
beer chasers, four drinks an hour are
regarded as none too many.
When experts get at the cards sluff
la liable to be a long drawn out propo
sition. At Tucson they have a record
of a game which lasted seven hours.
One must not think, however, that
the players waited that long for a
round of drinks. Every fifteen min
utes or so they cut the cards and the
low man bought.
Social success in Arizona no longer
depends on one's ability to play draw
or stud poker. From Prescott to Bis
bee it is sluff, morning, noon and
night, says the Prescott correspondent
of the St. Louis Globe-Democrat.
Arizona people take the game seri
ously and play as carefully as If the
stakes were high. It is thought bad
form to be garrulous during the play,
but after the hand is played the plays
are carefully analyzed.
eleven cards and a widow of three
cards. The deal passes after each
hand.
The player to the right of tne
dealer has the say, and may frog,
solo, solo grande or pass. If he frogs,
hearts are trump: the widow Is shown
and taken to hand by the maker.
If he solos the trump must be dia
monds, clubs or spades, and the widow
is not looked at until the conclusion of
the hand, when the. maker adds any
counters it may contain in his hand.
If he solo grandes he has the privi
lege of calling the trump.
If the player to the left of the
dealer frogs the others may solo over
him. The original maker then solo
grandes or passes.
At the beginning of the game each
player receives chips worth 120 points,
usually, eleven blues anjl ten whites.
When one player loses his stack the
game ends and the penalty of buying a
round of drinks is exacted.
The maker must win sixty points to
make good. For all under that he
must pay; for all over sixty he is paid
by each of his opponents. If four are
playing and the maker loses he has to
pay the dealer as well, but If the
maker makes good the dealer does not
pay.
In a frog each point pays one; in
solo, two; in solo grande, three.
Any card of any suit may be led.
One must follow suit if possible. If
out of suit a trump Is required.
If out of trumps one should sluff If
playing third in hand, and one's part
ner holds the tricks. Slufflng means
to play one's highest counting card.
As a rule, when one against the
maker has the game in hand and
, takes a trick second in hand, he
thrown his card on the table as though
; he desired to break it. and calls. "Now.
ydu, sluff!"
When a player Is out of suit that
suit is called his dink. When one of
the players can force the* maker to
trump a suit is called "having his
dink."

New York Stock Market:
NEW YORK. Sei*. 13.â The wild price
movements in the craln market to-day made
an effect on securities unavoidable. Prices of
stocks are, iu consequence, lower than last
night. The low stage to which the wheat crop
prospects have fallen has become an ac
cepted fact in Wall street, so that the princi
pal attention is oaid in speculative circles to
the corn crop, on which remaining hopes are
largely based to redeem the condition of af
fairs. The unreasonable weather in the corn
belt caused great alarm, which the stock mar
ket was unable to withstand. The weekly
bulletin of the Weather Bureau was unusually
outspoken in its assurances against harm to
the corn crop by the frosts which have. already
occurred, but a weather "forecast which fore
told of frosts for the night deep into the corn
belt created t*ie liveliest apprehensions. The
detailed statement of domestic exports for
August reveals the fact that the heavy fall
ing off in value of foodstuffs exported , Is due
almost wholly to the prohibitive price at which
wheat is held, the August exports of that cereal
amounting to but 216.4G9 bushels,- compared
with 6,4*4,439 bushels in August of last year.
The 3,094.490 bushels of corn exported in Au
gust show a nominal falling off from last year.
The weakness due to the corn crop scare and
the unpromising wheat -prospects permeatej the
railroad list very xenerally. although much is
hoped from the cotton ctod. especially In the
results to Its own territory and its tributaries.
The lifting of Pennsylvania to the highest
price had the effect of checking the declining
movement elsewhere and in starting an effect
ive recovery. There was Eome strength In the
railway equipment stocks. Money rates were
again steady, especially for the shorter pe
riods, and $500,000 of gold was engaged for ex
port to South America. The money market is
1 looking forward to another larpe decline in
cash reserves for the current week.
The weakness - of stocks had aji effect on
bonds. Total sales, $4,775,000.
United States bonds were unchanged on call.

Trade in fresh fruits was confined almost
entirely to the filling of regular local wants,
but as receipts of most descriptions were
comparatively light, prices were well main
tained and the market generally had a steady
tone. The day's supplies of Peaches consisted
chiefly of Oregon fruit, about 1200 small boxes
beliu: received from that State. Off erlnrs in
larze open boxes were mostly culls and met
wltn very slow sale. The canners were pick
ing up Freestones at $25 per ton. Strictly
fancy Bartlett Pears were scarce and firm
at the top quotation, while Winter varieties
were inclined to easiness. Apples were rather
weak than otherwise, with low grade stock
commencing to accumulate. Pomegranates and
Fii.3 did better, while Quinces were weak at
lower prices. Table Grapes were In good de
mand, particularly highly colored offerings of
the Tokay variety, and as receipts were rather
liÂ°ht, the market was well cleaned up at the
close. Wine Grapes continued . to drag at
easy rates. The market for Citrus fruits was
firm, with stocks of Lemons and Limes very
light.

CHICAGO, Sept. 13.â Intense excitement
prevailed in the wheat .pit at . the opening,
with apparently every trader an avowed buyer.
The demand was t-o urgent and offerings so
limited I that prices for all deliveries were
bid up fully 2c at the start. Initial quotations
on December showing a gain of l%c to 2%c
at $1 14 to (1 14%. May was up l%c to 2%c
at $115% to $1 10%. The cause ot the tur
moil was a cold wave which spread, over the
Canadinn Northwest last night, practically
ruining much of the wheat still standing. In
Manitoba the loss is estimated at 25 per cent
of , the crop. The desire to buy was Increased
by the strong tone of all foreign grain mar
kets, sharp advances abroad furnishing indica
tions of universal alarm regarding the Ameri
can wheat Â»crop. The buying* was on such a
heavy scale that it was, almost Impossible to
follow the market. As the session advanced
causes of fresh grief for the bears appeared.
Primary .receipts show;ed nearly a 50 per cent
decrease compared with a year ago, and pri
vate advices from the Northwest regarding
thrsshing returns were distinctly disappoint
ing. On the urgent demand prices rose rapidly
at times. The high point for May was reached
at $1 18%@l r .18%> nearly 2c above the former
high ' record mark. â¢ Previous - to to-day th.e
best figure was SI 17, at which price wheat
for May delivery sold on "August 6. The un
usual activity continued unabated through â¢ the
entire session the market closing strong, with
May at $1 17%@1 18. Final quotations on De
cember were $1 15%; :
The corn market sympathized with wheat,
bringing out liberal buying by shorts and also
heavy purchases for Investment account. At
the opening December was up %c to l%c'at
52c to 54V6c. With the announcement of the
Weather Bureau predictlqns the price quickly
shot up to 54%@54Vic. Small reactions fol
lowed on profit-taking, but the market closed
strong, -with December at 53%c.
Oats shared In the general bullish situation.
December opened %@Uc higher at 32%c and
closed at 33*4 c. 3 â¢ 'Â¦
Provisions were weak early in the session.
Later there was a flurry in January pork on
extreme covering by shorts, the advance ex
tending throughout the entire list. The mar
ket closed with pork up 25c, lard 2%c higher
and ribs 5@10c up.

WHEAT FREIGHTS â The shipowners' com
bine have evidently carried their point as to
freight rates, for spot chartering is now go
ing on at their rate of 23s Od for Barley, 'usual
European options. The rate asked for Wheat
is 228 6d, but' shippers will not pay it.' saying
that It is impossible . at present prices for
Wheat. They will not even bid 20s. The char
tered Wheat fleet in port has a registered ton
nage of 28,100. agsinst 51,700 tons on the same
date last year; disengaged, 02,300 tons, against
88,400; on the way to this port, 212,800 tons,
against 301,800.
WHEAT â The foreign markets were firm,
with higher futures.
Chicago soared from $1 12% to $1 16% and
closed at $1 15%. the advance being due to
frosts and rains in the Northwest and fears
of a delayed harvest, which make the shorts
very nervous. The whole trade is coming to
the conclusion that the country will have no
Wheat for exnort. and that what we export
now we will miss later. The " cash demand
is- strong.
The Chicago wires of E. F. Hutton & Co.
said: "The close was about a cent oft from
top prices. It was a booming market on large
trade and higher cables, and rains followed
by frost in Manitoba helped it. There was
doubtless a great deal of covering of shorts
and profit taking at the advance. - The close
was a little easier. The cash demand seems to
follow the advance very well. After two days
of a runaway market we think profit taking
should he in order."
In this market futures were higher under
heavy trading, but the market is not follow-"
ing the Chicago market as it should. Sellers
are trying to get an advance for the cash
grain, but without much success, as the mill
ers say that unless the demand for Flour im
proves they cannot pay any higher prices for
Wheat.

Henry H. Coobom Tries to Have
Goarj -Street Line End His
Existence.
Henry H. Coobom, while laboring
under a temporary aberration of mind
caused by an overindulgence in intoxi
cants, made several ineffectual at
tompta to take his life yesterday by
throwing himself under the Geary
sireet cars near Octavia street. In
each case he failed to accomplish his
purpose, as the gripmen saw him in
time and stopped the cars before any
damage was done. His modus oper
and! was to wait until a car was ap
proaching, when he would suddenly
hurl himself before it, flat on the
track. The alert gripmen stopped the
cars each time. Fatting in this, he
climbed upon a pile of mortar on the
street and tried to butt his brains out
apainst a brick wall. At this period In
the game Mounted Police Officer E. E.
Gable appeared upon the scene, and,
after a struggle, in which Gable got
a sprained ankle, Coobom was sub
dued and taken to the Emergency
Hospital. There Dr. Glover dressed, a
number of slight cuts and wounds that
the patient had suffered by his crazy
actions. It was â¢ found . necessary to
put him in a straitjacket.
BY LAURA BRIDE POWERS.
Stupefied by smoke and enveloped by
flames, George Holtz. a 17-year-old boy.
was burned to death In the fire that de
stroyed the mattress factory at 1121
Howard street yesterday.
Anna Jones, employed -on the second
floor of the building, barely escaped
alive. She fainted when the alarm
came, but was discovered and carried
from the place by Earl West. :--;-:
The fire was caused by sparks from
an electric motor, which ignited a pile
of inflammable shoddy. The flames
spread to the Colonial Packing Com
pany^ building, which was totally de
stroyed. 'Â¦.
Young Holtz was working on the
fcurth floor with a boy named Walter
Mills. They wrre sorting shoddy. Sud
denly Mills shouted "Fire!" and ran to
ward a window. As he was opening it
flames darted up from the shoddy pile
and a volume of smoke filled the room.
Mills started to climb down a fire-es
cape. Looking bark he saw Holtz
standing bewildered. The flames be
came fiercer every instant, and Mills
hurried down the ladder. Holtz was
never seen alive after that moment.
Stumbling about in the choking smoke
he soon fell to the burning floor and
euccumbed.
Thomas Holtz, a younger brother of
the unfortunate boy. heard George's
shriek of terror and made a dash for
the stairs to go to George's aid, but was
driven T>ack by the flames. Broken
hearted. Thomas Holtz gave it up and
hurried to a place of safety.
There were in all seven people work
ing on the lower floor when the blaze
ptarted. Almost as soon as the alarm
was given tongues of flame shot down
from the floor above.
A general alarm was turned in, but it
was some time before the firemen had
the flames under control. Meanwhile
the spectators, who had heard that a
human being was imprisoned by the
flames, .were frenzied with horror. Des
perate efforts to reach the doomed boy
were made by the firemen, but the
shoddy and other inflammable material
made "too hot a fire. When the flames
were extinguished the charred body of
George Holtz was found near where he
had worked.
The California Club wants a.club
house. â¢ Likewise it wants a â¢ $25,000
clubhouse instead of a proposed $40,000
structureâ for the club itself has so
declaredâ that is, the majority of- those
who didn't run away at roll call. And
there's a strong suspicion abroad, that
this time the club really knows what it
wantsâ and wants what it can get.'
And therein lies some good philosophy,
gleaned, it is true, from some hard
headed bank presidents, they who
would be called upon to advance the
necessary ducats on the club's Clay
street lot. But it's good philosophy,
none the less. '
i The meeting of yesterday was . pur
! posely called to- reconsider what was
i thought by many conservative mem
i bers to be. a rash propositionâ that -of
committing the club to a $40,000 bor
row. And .there were many who- had
; haunting fears of "personal responsi
bility"âa bugbear of purely masculine
origin and wholly beyond the realm of,
possibilities. Ye gods! '." How women
scare at hobgoblins!
If the women who cast the die didn't
know what they were voting for â which
they frequently don'tâ 'twas not the
j fault of the newly Installed, president,
! Mrs. Aylett R. Cotton, who read to the
: club a most comprehensive and suc
! cinct statement of what the club^could
do in the way of fund raising and 'the
I expenditure of the sum to be ; raised.
i Every possible point was adequately
'covered, save the amount, to be raised,
J which, might be. any sum within $25,000
fâ the club to decide the'amount.
! ' â¢ ' BANKING PROBLEMS.
At the conclusion of Mrs. Cotton's
statement, Mrs. C. R. Johnson took the
floor and gave a clever disquisition on
banks, liabilities and other unfeminine
things and then the fun : was ; on.
Soon were Russell Sages, Disraelis
and Depews on the floor, each the cen
ter-of an admiring group â¢ of . con
stituents.
In quick succession came discussions
by the following members â In the main
to the point, or to some point: " Mrs.
Sara E. Reamer. Mrs. Virginia Brad
ley, Mrs. S. L. Strickland, Mrs. M. C.
Sloss, Mrs. Hadwin Swain. Mrs. J. C.
Campbell. Mrs. Charles William Moores.
Mrs. Lovell White, Mrs. Rosa Poult
ney, Mrs. A. M. Burns, Dr. Dorothea
Moore, Miss Mary Fajrbrother (who,
being the parliamentarian, kept fair
weather), Mrs. Wallace P. Angels. Mrs:
George H. Dyer, Mrs. Louis Hertz,
Mrs. Arthur Cornwall and quite a -few
others â all of which eloquence served
to elucidate the matter after theman
.ner of the octopus clearing the sea.
However, out of the' mystic depths
came the great question, embellished
with an amendment,' placing the. sum
to be raised and expended at $25,000.
MOVED FOR ROLL- CALL.
Remembering ; the votes taken .last
May, many of which were promptly re
pudiated under fire, Mrs. Arthur Corn
wall moved for a roll call, which was
carried. Now, would the printed. word
tell the tale, compelling all who, would
'"knock" to forever hold' their peace!
But alas! There was the open door.:':;
Just at fhis .Juncture someV of > the
members needed ozoneâ others ,. didn't
find the need Â£ of . it until the â¢ secretary
got down close to their namesâ and
they, too, floated into the . air. â¢ : When
the fatal spot . in the roll had passed
they had sufficiently recovered" to Â» float
back and to participate. in the rest of
the very interesting session. . " ;
- Just as the open 'door beckoned some
member suggested the closing, of < the
same, when Miss Falrbrother reminded,
the club that "There's no law In Amer
ica to force a manor woman to vote."
That settled it. .Â¦> But when : the count
was taken the score stood 63 for and 40
againstâ the ozone quest notwithstand
ingâand the' question' carried. '
. And thus' the California Club declares
it wants a $25,000 club house.*, For. that
amount some patient, cheerful, 'tele
pathic, sympathetic, omniscient archi
tect can r, build a', pretty : clubhouse.
Here's to. him! Recalling the' while
Pope's deduction, "Woman is at best a
contradiction still."
But suppose some of , the ', did
vote^ "yesâ no," : still- therein -they
learned better. And 5 that was precisely
the way/ that \ men , learned >. the Â¦: lesson
of lifeâ Just by experience.;. And ; that's
the way that women will learn in, spite
of Shakespeare, who says, "A woman's
fitness comes by, fits." â¢ . '
ThÂ»* respective governing bodies of
the two leading political parties are
giving a vast deal of attention to the
subject of registration. For reasons
rot altogether obvious the registration
up to date is . below ' the standard.
Apathy- In this respect is not confined
to- either of the leading political or
ganizations, but exists in both parties.
The Republicans are making: a better
showing than the Democrats. Com
mittees of "the State League of Repub
lican Clubs have already secured the
enrollment of many Republicans of the
interior. Registration will not close
until September 28, and by that time
a complete enrollment may be accom
plished. Â¦ -'.A " '
The convenience of precinct registra
tion will be offered to the voters of
San Francisco to-day and to-morrow.
Workingmen, merchants and. business
men generally should note the oppor
tunity of precinct registration and ad
vise their associates to register to-day.
It is presumed that the local governing
bodies and Assembly district clubs will
advise the unregistered of the danger
of further delay. After, the local con
ventions have nominated their respec
tive tickets popular interest in the
campaign will be lively, but it is noted
that the time for registration will have
expired when the conventions adjourn.
The Republican local convention, for
example, will not assemble until Sep
tember 25. In all probability the can
didates for the Legislature and tht
Superior Bench will be named on 1 Sep
tember 27. On September 28 registra
tion closes. To-day every registered
Republican voter should make a spe
cial effort to secure the enrollment of
unregistered citizens.

COLORED VOTERS.
James Alexander, president of the
Afro-American Council, has issued the
following address relative â¢ to the im
portance of registration:- .
To the Colored Voters of California: As
president of the- Afro-American Council, and
in the interest of all Afro- Americans, I address
you this letter- that -you may have before you
for consideration a very important duty â one
that jou ewe yourself, your country and your
Goa. " The suffrage you- now have, gi\-en un
der the providence of God, is sacred and should
be held as th* highest privilege of a free man
in a free ccvernment. . .
â¢ We wish to remind you of, the importance
of registering before the 2Sth ' day of Septem
ber, as you cannot quality later than that
date for the coming election. ,. i
Tfyose of you who k*ep a close watch on
current topics : and events have, I am sur*.
noticed, with -not a little interest and pleasure,
how rapidly the negro vote ts . increaslns in
the North, and that he already holds the.bal
ance of power in many Northern States. Our
own State (California) in 1900 went Republican
by 1SC0 majority. At that time we had .1700
qualified electors. In 1902 the Republican Gov
ernor of. this State was elected by only 2800
votes. in majority, and at that time there were
4915 colored electors. Incomplete statistics of
lfÂ»04 Ehow about 9000 males of the race in this
State, -who will -be a power for good .govern
ment-snd fair play, if they will but profit by
the opportunity that we have in this State.
We especially appeal to the preachers and
leaders to use -their best efforts in 'teaching
the indifferent ones among us the Importance
of the ballot and the safeguard that it throws
around a people who handle it honestly and
wlrely.
Our people have come to California during
this year from all over the South, and not a
few Jrom what . we call the Eastern States.
We mlsht be safe In saying that fully 11,00))
nfgro voters are now in California; hence the
necessity of having them ' encouraged and
properly Instructed by our preachers and lead
ers.
It would be out of order for me to address
you at this time and fall to mention the name
of oat President, Theodore Roosevelt, who
stands for fair play, equal opportunities to all
men -and the perpetuity of a government . f or
and by â¢ the whole people. Every negro who
votes should vote for him.
- Let me arain insist that the â¢ preachers . and
leaders bring this matter before their congre
gations,. lodges, societies of every nature, busi
ness-organizations, clubs, etc. I am yours. for
the race and our common country,
JAMES ALEXANDER.

Last night Kate Brennan made a
wanton attempt to wreck the altar of
the Blessed Virgin in. St. Brigid's
Church. That she did not succeed 1 was
due- to the vigilance of Charles San
born, the sexton.' Startled .b"y the ap
proach of the sexton the woman desist
ed after breaking a lamp on the altar,
then" fled through a side door. Finding
no other, avenue of escape she jumped
from a porch to the pavement, a dis
tance of fifteen feet, suffering a frac
ture of both^bones of. the right leg be
low the knee. .
She 'was removed to th,e Central
Emergency Hospital. A, charge, of ma
licious mischief was . entered against
her name on the prison .register, but it
is . understood that she-will not be
prosecuted. '
According to Sexton Sanborn Miss
Brennan made a similar attempt a
week ago Sunday night. Â¦ At that time
she broke the lamp %nd threw oil over
the statue of the Blessed Virgin. She
has committed previous offenses of the
same character.
Sexton Sanborn had just completed
sounding the . angelus last evening
when he noticed the woman enter the
church. . He softly entered the edifice
after her and concealed himself in the
confessional. Stealthily' she approached
to begin her work of destruction.. Sud
denly her hand went up into the air
and descended with great force upon
the lamp on the altar. There was a
crash of glass and the oil bespattered
the sacred image. Sanborn rushed
from his hiding place and "criea out to
the woman to stay her hand. . - .
Miss Brennan "does not 'seem to re
alize the enormity â¢ of her offense
against the church /.of she is a
member. Father- John E.Cottle noti
fied the police at the North End station
that he believed she had been suffi
ciently punished and he would not
prosecute the charge against her. From
her actions it is believed that dementia
is responsible for the woman's actions!.
She emphatically denies the allegations
made against her. Her residence is at
1340 Polk street.
